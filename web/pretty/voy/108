<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  It was a sacred stone. The Ktarians lay thousands of them in the tomb. Each one represents a special prayer. Without realising it, I had desecrated that man's grave.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>TORRES:  They like to bury their dead on asteroids. That's about all I can tell without a tricorder. No artefacts, no inscriptions, just some naked dead people.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  You're looking but you're not seeing. The fact that they're naked says a lot. It means this race doesn't believe in dressing the deceased. And the lack of artefacts could indicate they don't believe any worldly goods can be taken into the afterlife.</td></tr>

The bodies have been arranged in poses of serenity, and they appear to be wrapped in the same biopolymer residue we found out in the passageway, all indications that this culture has a great deal of ritual associated with disposing of the dead. That normally indicates some belief in the afterlife.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>TORRES:  The Klingons believe in an afterlife, but there's no burial ritual. They just dispose of the corpse by the most efficient means possible.</td></tr>

This may not make much sense to you now, a young man at the beginning of his career, but one of the things you'll learn as you move up the ranks and get a little older is that you wish you had more time in your youth to really absorb all the things that happened to you. It goes by so fast. It's so easy to become jaded, to treat the extraordinary like just another day at the office, but sometimes there are experiences which transcend all that. You've just had one, Mister Kim, and I want you to live with it for a little while. Write about it, if you feel like it. Paint. Express yourself in some fashion. The Bridge will still be there in two days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L342"><td><a href="#L342">342</a></td><td>KIM:  Thank you, Captain. I have been a little preoccupied with the experience.

They just decay inside those asteroids.</td></tr>
