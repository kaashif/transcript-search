<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>EMH:  With flying colours, which leads me to believe you did hear me when I requested you meet me this morning.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>PARIS:  You're right. I forgot.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>EMH:  I see. I realise your Sickbay training is purely voluntary, but you haven't spent any time there in several weeks. And when I try to find you, you're always in the holodeck.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>PARIS:  Correct me if I'm wrong, Doc, but we haven't been treating anything more serious than an ingrown toenail.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>EMH:  That's beside the point. If an emergency were to happen you must be prepared. You're too far behind in your medical texts to be wasting your time in the holodeck.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>PARIS:  A classic case of atrophied shocks. They needed to be extracted to prevent chrome abrasion. It was touch and go for a while, but the prognosis is excellent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>PARIS:  Advanced subspace geometry. It's the one course at the academy where I actually paid attention. We'll tractor him in to kill his momentum, generate a warp field around his ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>TUVOK:  His flightpath is erratic. We'd be risking collision.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>PARIS:  Nothing is wrong. Since when is not wanting to spend time with the Doctor a capital offence? You'd have to throw the whole crew in the brig for that one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe. I was wondering if there's something on your mind. You're showing up for your duty shifts, you do what's required, but your heart doesn't seem to be in it. You seem preoccupied.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>STETH:  And the Entabans weren't too pleased to see me. I limped back to the engineers on Benthos with phaser holes through their brand new extanium fuselage. I think they would have been happy to see phaser holes through me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>PARIS:  When I was sixteen, I followed an ancient human custom. I took my father's shuttle out for a joy ride, and proceeded to fry all the relays.</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>STETH:  At least in spurts. Unfortunately, particle instabilities keep overloading my engines. But I'm going to make it work. I have to keep in motion. I don't like the thought of settling down. Too many new ships to drive. Too many intriguing women.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>PARIS:  Yeah, I guess so.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>STETH:  When I get this ship back I'm going to be doing the first test on a new Mithran class flyer.
