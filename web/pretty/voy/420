LOCATION--Pseudo Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     We know this is not real, because Janeway's hair
     is swept back and she is wearing a black roll-neck
     top beneath her uniform, and black leather gloves.
     Very sinister. Her words are also very non-Janeway
     and there is no comm. badge.

  pJANEWAY
     When diplomacy fails there's only one alternative.
     Violence. Force must be applied without apology.
     It's the Starfleet way.

  DALETH
     Then our philosophies are in agreement. Will you
     help us?

  pJANEWAY
     You're asking me to fight your war, destroy your
     enemy.

  DALETH
     I'm asking you to intimidate the Kyrians with your
     technology. Help me capture their leader. This
     ship has superior firepower. He won't risk a
     conflict with you.

  pJANEWAY
     We risk life and limb so your people can annex
     Kyrian land. Sounds like a good deal for you. What
     do we get?

  DALETH
     A way home.

  pJANEWAY
     You know more about Voyager than you've let on.

  DALETH
     Your reputation in this quadrant precedes you.
     That's why we sought you out.

  pJANEWAY
     I'm listening.

  DALETH
     There's a cyclic wormhole five days journey from
     here. We know where it is, and we can help you
     stabilise it.

  pJANEWAY
     If you're lying.

  DALETH
     How far do you have to go? Sixty thousand light
     years?

  pJANEWAY
     I want all tactical data regarding your little
     war. Kyrian defences, position of your own forces,
     everything.

  DALETH
     You'll have it within the hour.


LOCATION--Pseudo Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A Kazon walks through with a phaser rifle. Neelix
     is in uniform at Tactical.

  pNEELIX
     Eight Kyrian fighter ships approaching.

  pJANEWAY
     Arm the assault probes. Fire at will. Hail them.

  pTUVOK
     Channel open.

  pJANEWAY
     This is Captain Janeway of the warship Voyager.
     Break off your attack, or I'll destroy you.

  pTUVOK
     They are not responding.

  pPARIS
     They're returning fire. Shields are holding.

  pJANEWAY
     Chakotay, any luck tracking down their leader?

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay has a different tattoo, one that extends
     all down the left side of his face. Every
     pronounces his name without the emphasis on the
     middle syllable.

  pCHAKOTAY
     Not yet. We think Tedran has go-ne into hiding.

  pJANEWAY
     I thought he might. We'll have to flush him out.

  DALETH
     What do you suggest?

  pJANEWAY
     Biogenic weapons. We'll infect the most populated
     Kyrian territories. The Doctor's nearly done
     working on the weapon.

  DALETH
     Our conflict is with Tedran himself, not his
     people. They're innocent.

  pJANEWAY
     The best way to bring down a ruler is to make his
     people suffer.

  DALETH
     Captain

  pJANEWAY
     This is no time for half-measures. You wanted
     victory. You're going to get it. Bridge to
     Sickbay. Status?

  ANNOTATION
     This EMH is an android, like Data.

  pEMH
     We have established a datalink between my neural
     net and the phaser array. I am reconfiguring the
     beam to carry a bio-agent into the planet's
     atmosphere

  pJANEWAY [OC]
     When will it be ready?

  pEMH
     It is ready now, Captain.

LOCATION--Museum

  QUARREN
     The warship Voyager. One of the most powerful
     vessels of its time. Armed with photonic torpedoes
     and particle weapons, this ship of destruction
     could wipe out an entire civilisation within
     hours. On this particular day in history, we were
     lucky. The death toll could have been much worse.
     By the time Voyager targeted our major cities,
     Tedran had already begun an evacuation. Thousands
     of lives were saved. Unfortunately, it was only
     the beginning of Captain Janeway's onslaught. As
     you'll see, her actions would have a lasting
     effect on our world. Even today, seven hundred
     years later, we are still feeling the impact of
     the Voyager encounter. Before we continue the
     simulation, I'd like to answer any questions you
     might have.

  KYRIAN VISITOR
     I'm curious about Voyager itself. How many people
     were on board?

  QUARREN
     We believe they had a complement of over three
     hundred soldiers.

  KYRIAN VISITOR
     Did they attack other worlds as well?

  QUARREN
     Well, we aren't certain. Records of Voyager's
     travels through our quadrant are incomplete, but
     it's safe to assume that they interfered with many
     other cultures, yes.

  KYRIAN VISITOR
     Tell us more about the Borg drones they kept on
     the ship.

  QUARREN
     Voyager had many weapons at their disposal,
     including species they'd assimilated along the
     way. Borg, Talaxian, Kazon. They were captured and
     made to work as part of Voyager's fighting force.
     Let's resume the simulation, and you can see for
     yourself. It's a few hours after the initial
     bombardment. Janeway and her squadron are on the
     bridge mounting their assault. Now, what you are
     about to see is graphic and unsettling.


LOCATION--Pseudo Bridge

  pJANEWAY
     Status. Status!

  pNEELIX
     Approximately three thousand Kyrians dead.

  pJANEWAY
     That's it?

  pTUVOK
     The bio-agent is still dispersing through the
     atmosphere. The fatality rate will be three
     hundred thousand soon enough.

  pJANEWAY
     How soon?

  pTUVOK
     Best guess, one hour.

  pJANEWAY
     Why do you always keep me waiting, Tuvok?

  pTUVOK
     My apologies. Preparing to fire again.

  pJANEWAY
     Double the yield,

  DALETH
     Captain, don't you think that's excessive?

  pJANEWAY
     You picked a bad time to have second thoughts,
     Ambassador.

  DALETH
     I want them defeated but, but this is genocide!

  pJANEWAY
     Defeat? Genocide? Why quibble with semantics?

  DALETH
     This wasn't our agreement.

  pJANEWAY
     We're going to defeat the Kyrians, and you're
     going to keep up your end of the bargain.

  ANNOTATION
     Whumph!

  pJANEWAY
     Ensign, confine this gentleman to the brig. I'll
     let you know when it's over.

  ANNOTATION
     The Kazon takes Daleth away.

  pPARIS
     Three more Kyrian vessels approaching.

  pJANEWAY
     Evade them.

  pPARIS
     Aye, aye, sir.


LOCATION--Pseudo Interrogation Room

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay and Kim are hitting a Kyrian in what used
     to be the Medical lab.

  pCHAKOTAY
     The location.

  pKIM
     Look, I can keep this up all day. Tell the
     Commander what he wants to know. Maybe I can't
     keep this up all day.

  pCHAKOTAY
     I'm a man of peace. My native people are
     enlightened, non-violent, much like your own. I'm
     saddened that this has happened to you. If we can
     work together maybe we can end this conflict.

  pKIM
     Stand aside, Chakotay. Let me hit him.

  pEMH
     That hyperspanner would cause an unacceptable
     level of damage. I remind you, he must still be
     able to speak.

  pKIM
     What do you have in mind?

  pEMH
     This neural solvent. A clean and efficient inducer
     of pain. Far more effective than your crude
     attempts at persuasion.

  ANNOTATION
     The evil EMH injects the Kyrian.

  pEMH
     No doubt you are experiencing a tingling sensation
     behind your eyes. The chemical is dissolving your
     optic nerves.

  pCHAKOTAY
     I'll ask you again. Where is Tedran?

  pEMH
     The pain will increase exponentially until your
     cerebral cortex begins to liquefy. I can reverse
     the process, if ordered to do so.

  pCHAKOTAY
     And I want to give that order. But you have to
     tell me. Where is Tedran?


LOCATION--Pseudo Bridge

  pCHAKOTAY
     He's here, at these coordinates.

  pJANEWAY
     Assuming our prisoner told you the truth.

  pCHAKOTAY
     Oh, believe me, he was very cooperative at the
     end.

  pJANEWAY
     Neelix?

  pNEELIX
     I'm reading a fortified compound one point six
     kilometres below the surface.

  pJANEWAY
     Chakotay, you and Tuvok take an assault team and
     find Tedran. Make sure he's escorted safely to
     Voyager.

  pCHAKOTAY
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Whump!

  pJANEWAY
     What now?

  pPARIS
     Intruders. Four Kyrians just beamed into the
     engine room.

  pJANEWAY
     Bridge to Engineering. Respond.

  pNEELIX
     They've erected forcefields. Our soldiers can't
     get in.

  pJANEWAY
     They've left me no choice. Computer, initiate the
     Borg activation sequence.

  COMPUTER
     Sequence in progress.

  pJANEWAY
     Acknowledged.

  pSEVEN [OC]
     Two of the Kyrians are still alive. What shall we
     do with them?

  pJANEWAY
     Well, you've been wanting to expand your fighting
     force. Assimilate them.


LOCATION--Pseudo Engineering

  pSEVEN
     We understand.


LOCATION--Pseudo Bridge

  pKIM
     I just received word from the attack team.

  pJANEWAY
     Good news, Lieutenant?

  pKIM
     Very. They've captured Tedran and one of his
     aides. They're heading back to Voyager.

  pJANEWAY
     Take them to chamber nineteen and get the Vaskan
     ambassador. This is one negotiation he won't want
     to miss.


LOCATION--Pseudo Chamber Nineteen

  ANNOTATION
     An empty mess hall. An elegant man and woman in
     long robes are there, along with the pseudo EMH
     and Daleth.

  pJANEWAY
     Welcome aboard.

  TEDRAN
     I appreciate your hospitality. Are all your guests
     treated so well?

  pJANEWAY
     It's not every day that we receive such an
     important visitor. The great Tedran. A man of
     wisdom and peace. A servant of his people. Well,
     your people need you now more than ever.

  TEDRAN
     State your demands.

  pJANEWAY
     Tell your forces to stand down, and I'll call off
     my attack.

  TEDRAN
     I understand what the Vaskans want. More of our
     territory, more resources. But what do you want,
     Captain? Why are you doing this to us?

  pJANEWAY
     He's offered my crew a way home.

  TEDRAN
     To reach your home, you would destroy ours?

  pJANEWAY
     That's right. And you'd do the same in my
     position.

  TEDRAN
     No, I would not.

  pJANEWAY
     Spoken like a true martyr. You're very
     enlightened. But are you so proud that you'd let
     your people die before you'd humble yourself?

  ANNOTATION
     Tedran and his lady are pushed to their knees.

  pJANEWAY
     Tell them to surrender.

  TEDRAN
     (to Daleth) You have shamed us all. We could've
     ended this on our own, peacefully, without her.

  pJANEWAY
     Surrender.

  TEDRAN
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Pseudo Janeway takes a phaser rifle and shoots the
     woman in the back.

  TEDRAN
     We will prevail.

  ANNOTATION
     She kills Tedran, too.

  pJANEWAY
     Don't look so shocked, Ambassador. This is what
     you wanted, isn't it?


LOCATION--Museum

  QUARREN
     The ensuing conflict was brief but brutal. Two
     million Kyrians slaughtered within days. The
     warship Voyager continued on its way, leaving the
     Kyrian dynasty in ruins. The Vaskan leaders
     proceeded to occupy our lands, forcing my people
     into subservience. It took centuries for us to
     undo the damage that Captain Janeway had done, and
     the Kyrian struggle for equality is far from over.
     This simulation and this museum are a testament to
     that struggle. I hope you found your experience
     here worthwhile. If you'd like to learn more about
     Voyager and its role in the history of our planet,
     I suggest you explore the rest of this exhibit.
     Thank you for your time.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the exhibits is a photon torpedo case
     clearly labelled U.S.S. Voyager. Later, a Vaskan
     man has his fingers in the torpedo's controls.

  QUARREN
     Please, feel free to test the simulators. I
     wouldn't touch that if I were you. One of the
     Voyager's torpedoes. Twenty five isoton yield. It
     could destroy an entire city within seconds. It's
     been inactive for centuries but you never know.
     I'm only teasing, but please be careful. If we
     damage any of these relics they can never be
     replaced. The history of our people should be
     respected.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     I have a question about that history.

  QUARREN
     Please.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     How can you prove that it's true?

  QUARREN
     Take a closer look. The evidence is all around
     you.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     Some musty fossils and a recreation? That doesn't
     prove anything.

  QUARREN
     I disagree.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     You're trying to blame the Vaskans for all your
     troubles the way you always do. I don't have a
     problem with your species. I have Kyrian friends.
     But I don't appreciate seeing my people being
     portrayed as villains in your little simulation,
     and I certainly don't want your history taught to
     my children.

  QUARREN
     You'd better get used to the idea, because we've
     just uncovered an artefact that's going to confirm
     everything you've seen here. Three weeks ago our
     research team found a data storage device buried
     nine metres beneath the ruins at Kesef. I've
     confirmed that it came from Voyager.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     Another fossil.

  QUARREN
     The device contains active data. Possibly crew
     logs, even Captain Janeway's personal almanac. In
     the next few days, we could be hearing Voyager's
     version of these events in their own words.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     And what if those words tell a different story?
     What then?

  QUARREN
     We will change our views accordingly.

  VASKAN VISITOR
     I'm sure you will.

  ANNOTATION
     The Vaskan leaves.

  QUARREN
     I apologise. Please, enjoy the rest of your visit.

     He sits at a console and presses his comm. badge.

  QUARREN
     Begin dictation. I'm resuming work on artefact two
     seven one, the Voyager data storage device. I've
     decided to try using period tools from the
     simulation itself. With any luck, they'll be more
     compatible. Hmm. There's far more data here than I
     expected. Seems more like a programme of some
     sort. Yes. Yes, it's an optronic datastream. A
     hologram.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets the hologram to flicker into existence.

  EMH
     Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
     Please state the nature of the medical emergency.

  QUARREN
     I recognise you. You're Voyager's doctor.

  EMH
     What am I doing in Engineering? Where's my mobile
     emitter?

  QUARREN
     You're not an android.

  EMH
     Of course not. What are you talking about? A
     Kyrian. Doctor to the bridge, intruder alert.
     Security to Engineering.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH tries using a console.

  QUARREN
     You won't have much luck with that. Nothing in
     here is real. It's a simulation.

  EMH
     A holodeck?

  QUARREN
     No. You're in the Museum of Kyrian Heritage.

  EMH
     You've stolen my programme. How?

  QUARREN
     Please, let me try to explain.

  EMH
     Try quickly.

  QUARREN
     You are a hologram.

  EMH
     That I know.

  QUARREN
     I just discovered your programme inside this data
     storage device.

  EMH
     That's the EMH backup module. One of your attack
     parties must have taken it from Sickbay.

  QUARREN
     Actually, we found it at the ruins at Kesef. I
     know this will be difficult for you to accept, but
     a great deal of time has passed since Voyager
     encountered the Kyrians.

  EMH
     How much time?

  QUARREN
     Seven hundred years, give or take a decade. We're
     not certain.

  EMH
     I don't believe you.

  QUARREN
     Think about it. When your programme is inactive, a
     moment or a millennium are the same to you.

  EMH
     Seven hundred years? What about my ship? What
     happened to my crew?

  QUARREN
     No one knows. It's safe to say they're long dead.

  EMH
     And I'm some sort of fossil?

  QUARREN
     No, not a fossil. A witness. A living witness to
     history. There's so much we don't know about what
     happened. But you saw it, you lived through those
     times. You helped to shape them. Doctor, you could
     be the most important discovery of all time.

  EMH
     No. This is impossible.

  QUARREN
     Doctor.

  EMH
     I don't believe you!

  QUARREN
     Doctor!

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH runs out of the simulation.


LOCATION--Museum

  EMH
     What's going to happen to me now? Will you put me
     on display? The holographic Rip van Winkle?

  QUARREN
     I'm not sure.

  EMH
     I want to try to contact Starfleet, if there still
     is a Starfleet.

  QUARREN
     That will have to wait.

  EMH
     Wait for what?

  QUARREN
     There are other issues to be resolved.

  EMH
     What kind of issues?

  QUARREN
     You're the Voyager doctor. A lot of people are
     going to have questions. On our world, artificial
     lifeforms are considered sentient and responsible
     for their actions. You might have to face charges.

  EMH
     Charges?

  QUARREN
     For your crimes. You designed the bio-weapons that
     killed eight million Kyrians.

  EMH
     I did nothing of the sort.

  QUARREN
     All of our evidence shows that you were a war
     criminal.

  EMH
     Evidence? What evidence? Like this, for example?
     Triple-armoured hull? Thirty torpedo tubes? Twenty
     five phaser banks? This isn't what our ship looked
     like.

  QUARREN
     We reconstructed it from a partial schematic found
     in the Cyrik ocean, which was badly damaged by
     corrosion. We were bound to get a few details
     wrong.

  EMH
     Voyager wasn't a warship. We were explorers.

  QUARREN
     Yes, I know. Trying to get home, to Mars.

  EMH
     Earth! You see, you couldn't even get that right.
     This is a nightmare. What if I'm found guilty?
     What's going to happen to me?

  QUARREN
     That's up to the Arbiters, but I imagine the
     penalty would be severe. Your programme could be
     de-compiled.

  EMH
     You've got to believe me. To you, this may be
     ancient history. To me, it's yesterday. You called
     me a living witness. Well, at least give me the
     chance to set the record straight. I want to see
     your version of what happened.


LOCATION--Pseudo Briefing room

  pPARIS
     We've already drained two phaser banks, and he
     hasn't hit anything.

  pTUVOK
     If you looked at your console once in a while
     instead of chasing the female ensigns, you'd see
     otherwise.

  pKIM
     Tom's right. This war was supposed to be over in
     five minutes.

  pCHAKOTAY
     You have a better idea, Lieutenant?

  pPARIS
     As a matter of fact I do. Fighter shuttles. A
     direct assault.

  pNEELIX
     Led by you? Good luck.

  pPARIS
     Watch your mouth, hedgehog.

     Pseudo Janeway shoots her hand phaser at a wall
     screen. The fight stops.

  pJANEWAY
     Save it for the holodeck. We've got a war to
     fight. We've only been attacking the Kyrian
     military installations. A mistake. We should
     target the general population.

  pEMH
     Excellent idea, Captain. I have examined the
     Kyrian genome and they would be vulnerable to any
     number of biological weapons.

  pJANEWAY
     How soon could you have one ready?

  pEMH
     Within the hour.

  pJANEWAY
     Dismissed.

  EMH
     Pure fiction. This is absurd.

  QUARREN
     Halt recreation. This is a reasonable
     extrapolation from historic record. But if you'd
     like to point out any inconsistencies.

  EMH
     Inconsistencies? I don't know where to begin.
     Granted, this looks like the briefing room but
     these aren't the people I knew. No one behaved
     like this. Well, aside from Mister Paris. We
     weren't at each other's throats. We didn't talk
     about how to destroy planets. We helped people. We
     were an enlightened crew.

  QUARREN
     Are you denying these events took place?

  EMH
     Yes.

  QUARREN
     Are you saying you never got involved with the
     conflict between my people and the Vaskans?

  EMH
     Yes! Well, no, we did get involved, but it was
     nothing like this.

  QUARREN
     Elaborate.

  EMH
     There was a meeting in this room, but it wasn't
     about battle tactics. It was about a dilemma we
     were facing. We had negotiated a trade agreement
     with the Vaskans. We were dealing with a
     representative, Ambassador

  QUARREN
     Ambassador Daleth.

  EMH
     Daleth. Exactly. Everything was going according to
     plan until we were attacked. By your people, the
     Kyrians. They'd picked that moment to start a war
     and we were caught in the middle.

  QUARREN
     The Kyrians were the aggressors? No, no. That
     can't be right.

  EMH
     Captain Janeway called this meeting to figure out
     how we could extricate ourselves from the conflict
     and still maintain the trade agreement with the
     Vaskans. But we weren't on their side, and we
     certainly never attacked you.

  QUARREN
     Save your objections until you see the entire
     recreation. Let's continue.


LOCATION--Pseudo Chamber 19

  ANNOTATION
     After pseudo Janeway has killed the woman.

  pTEDRAN
     We will prevail.

  ANNOTATION
     She kills Tedran.

  pJANEWAY
     Don't look so shocked, Ambassador. This is what
     you wanted, isn't it?

  EMH
     Somewhere, halfway across the galaxy I hope,
     Captain Janeway is spinning in her grave. You've
     portrayed us as monsters. The Captain's a
     cold-blooded killer, the crew's a gang of thugs
     and I'm a mass murderer.

  QUARREN
     Calm yourself.

  EMH
     Why should I? I'm about to be hanged for crimes I
     didn't commit!

  QUARREN
     Tell me your version of events.

  EMH
     I remember this man.

  QUARREN
     Tedran. He was a martyr to our people.

  EMH
     Some martyr. He led the Kyrian attack against
     Voyager.

  QUARREN
     You're lying.

  EMH
     I was there.

  QUARREN
     You're trying to protect yourself.

  EMH
     And so are you. From the truth. Isn't it a
     coincidence that the Kyrians are being portrayed
     in the best possible light? Martyrs, heroes,
     saviours. Obviously, events have been
     reinterpreted to make your people feel better
     about themselves. Revisionist history. It's such a
     comfort.

  QUARREN
     We were not the aggressors in the Great War, we
     were the victims. The proof can be found anywhere
     on this world. The Kyrian people are being
     oppressed to this day.

  EMH
     The problems in your society are none of my
     business. I'm just telling you what I saw seven
     hundred years ago.

  QUARREN
     I don't believe you, and neither will anyone else.

  EMH
     What are you doing?

  QUARREN
     Shutting down your programme.

  EMH
     Wait, please. I can prove to you I'm right. The
     medical tricorder, the artefact you have on
     display. If you just let me

  ANNOTATION
     Quarren deactivates the EMH.

  QUARREN
     Lies.


LOCATION--Quarren's home

  QUARREN
     Begin dictation. I've re-examined the data module.
     From what I can tell, the Doctor was telling the
     truth, at least about one thing. He is a hologram.
     A backup programme. We always knew he was an
     artificial lifeform but, we thought he was an
     android. If we were mistaken about that, I wonder
     if we might also be wrong about Voyager itself.
     Another question. Why would a hologram designed
     for medical purposes be programmed to lie so
     readily? From the moment I activated him, this
     Doctor has insisted that he's innocent. At first I
     didn't believe him. End dictation.


LOCATION--Museum

  ANNOTATION
     Next day, Quarren returns to his museum and looks
     at the medical tricorder they have on display.

  QUARREN
     Activate recreation, the Voyager encounter.
     Display medical chamber.


LOCATION--pseudo Sickbay

  EMH
     Please state the nature of the medical. Oh, it's
     you.

  QUARREN
     You've given me a lot to think about.

  EMH
     Really? I thought you'd heard enough of my lies.

  QUARREN
     I judged you too quickly. I'm sorry.

  EMH
     What changed your mind?

  QUARREN
     Time to think.

  EMH
     For your information, I don't appreciate being
     deactivated in the middle of a sentence. It brings
     back unpleasant memories.

  QUARREN
     It won't happen again.

  EMH
     Good, because if you don't stop treating me like a
     second-class hologram, I won't cooperate with your
     investigation. I'm perfectly happy to lie dormant
     in that module for a few eons.

  QUARREN
     I didn't come here to argue.

  EMH
     Then what do you want?

  QUARREN
     I don't know. To talk, I guess, about what really
     happened seven hundred years ago.

  EMH
     Are you sure you're willing to listen to a
     mass-murderer like me?

  QUARREN
     I'm willing to keep an open mind. That's the most
     I can promise. Try to understand my point of view.
     All my life, I thought I knew the truth. There was
     never any doubt.

  EMH
     I never meant to throw your beliefs into doubt,
     but I can't deny what I know to be true.

  QUARREN
     I realise that now, and I want to know the truth.
     And I want the Arbiters to know it, too.

  EMH
     Well, the stage is certainly set, but I'll have to
     rewrite the characters and revise the plot a
     little. I'm quite adept in the art of holographic
     programming. If you'll give me access to your
     technology, maybe I can create a simulation of
     own. Show you what happened.


LOCATION--Pseudo Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     This time, in the correct uniform and hair style.

  pJANEWAY
     Don't worry, Ambassador. We've got plenty of
     medical supplies and we'd be more than happy to
     share them with you.

  DALETH
     Then we agree. In exchange, we'll provide you with
     as much dilithium as you need.

  pJANEWAY
     That's very generous, Ambassador

  DALETH
     I'll transport the canisters immediately. It would
     be in your best interest to make this exchange
     quickly.

  pJANEWAY
     Oh? Why's that?

  DALETH
     We've been conflict with a neighbouring species,
     the Kyrians. They've been threatening to attack
     us. War could break out any day. We've tried every
     diplomatic option, but the Kyrians are a violent,
     stubborn people.

  pJANEWAY
     No problem. I understand what you're going
     through.

  DALETH
     I wish I could make you one of our diplomats. You
     might have better luck resolving this situation.

  pJANEWAY
     Under different circumstances. Janeway to Sickbay.
