The Disease
TEASER

LOCATION--Varro ship - Tal's cabin

  ANNOTATION
     In an enormous, long modular spaceship, Harry Kim
     is fraternising enthusiastically with a young
     woman.

  KIM
     We shouldn't be here.

  TAL
     Don't worry. Nobody saw us leave.

  ANNOTATION
     She removes his comm, badge.( KIM: Hey, I need
     that. What if somebody tries to call? TAL: Shush.
     (A door opens and closes nearby.

  KIM
     What was that?

  TAL
     Don't worry. Come here.

  ANNOTATION
     She rips off his uniform jacket, pushes him down
     onto the bed and straddles him to kiss his chest.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, supplemental. After two weeks we're
     close to repairing the Varro's warp drive. Then
     there's the Varro crew. I'm starting to think
     they'd rather give up warp travel than accept help
     from strangers.


LOCATION--Varro ship - Central control

  JIPPEQ
     I thought we agreed Central Control would be off
     limits.

  ANNOTATION
     He is a middle-aged male. Janeway has been getting
     her hands dirty, and wipes them on a cloth.

  JANEWAY
     We did, but I need to access your warp assembly.

  JIPPEQ
     That technology's classified.

  JANEWAY
     We have to reconfigure the assembly if we're going
     to finish this job.

  JIPPEQ
     Then consider it finished.

  JANEWAY
     We've come this far.

  JIPPEQ
     You've turned our ship upside down for two weeks,
     and I've yet to see any results.

  JANEWAY
     You might check the antimatter injectors.

  JIPPEQ
     Back online.

  JANEWAY
     All you need now is a jolt of antimatter from
     Voyager's engines and you'll be back in business,
     but I need access to your warp assembly. You know,
     I can understand why you're distrustful of other
     species. Frankly, we've had a rough time in the
     Delta Quadrant ourselves. But our two species have
     made remarkable progress working together to
     repair your engines. We've come a long way since
     you ignored our opening hails. Let's not throw all
     that away.

  JIPPEQ
     I'll admit we do share some things in common.

  JANEWAY
     We're both on long journeys, looking for allies.
     In many ways, we're like cousins.

  JIPPEQ
     Cousins?

  JANEWAY
     Well, distant cousins. Think about it. Four
     hundred years ago you started out the same way we
     did, a single starship, a small crew, facing the
     unknown. And now, centuries later, you've grown
     into a generational ship with a history and
     culture all your own. When I look at your vessel,
     I can't help but wonder if I'm seeing Voyager's
     future. Our journey could easily last several
     generations. So, what do you say, cousin?

  JIPPEQ
     You can access the warp assembly from here.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres and Paris enter. He is carrying a box.

  JANEWAY
     Status?

  TORRES
     The plasma couplings are online. We're ready for
     the antimatter transfer.

  JANEWAY
     Then let's get started. Janeway to


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Voyager. Status.

  CHAKOTAY
     Ready here, Captain.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Initiate the transfer.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay nods to Tuvok, who does the work.


LOCATION--Varro ship - Central control

  JIPPEQ
     Warp reactors one through fourteen are coming
     online. It's working.

  JANEWAY
     Keep your fingers crossed. For luck.


LOCATION--Varro ship - Tal's cabin

  ANNOTATION
     Tal wakes up, with only a sheet discreetly wrapped
     around her.

  TAL
     If you're planning on leaving through the
     viewport, you might want to get dressed. The
     interstellar vacuum might get a little chilly.

  KIM
     What? Oh, funny.

  TAL
     Come back to bed.

  KIM
     I can't sleep.

  TAL
     Cuddle.

  KIM
     I can't cuddle.

  TAL
     I told you we're not going to get caught. If
     someone had seen us, they would've reported it by
     now.

  KIM
     I'm violating about half a dozen regulations by
     just being in this room. And what we did earlier?
     I don't know if Starfleet even has a regulation
     for that.

  TAL
     What are you saying? Making love is a crime in
     your culture?

  KIM
     Yes! No. What I'm saying is, it's a breach of
     protocol.

  TAL
     How romantic.

  KIM
     The Captain instructed all away teams. No personal
     interaction with the Varro crew. I violated a
     direct order.

  TAL
     Come back to bed. That's an order.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim sits down next to her.

  TAL
     Are all humans so jumpy?

  KIM
     No, only me.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shakes slightly.

  KIM
     The warp engines. They've started the plasma
     transfer. We've got to get down there. We're late.
     What are you waiting for?

  TAL
     To see what you look like in my uniform.

  KIM
     You don't understand. If I'm not at my post.

  TAL
     You'll be executed?

  KIM
     Funny. We'd better go in separately.


LOCATION--Varro ship - Central Control

  TORRES
     Impressive.

  PARIS
     Just trying to orchestrate the antimatter flow.

  TORRES
     You should try some Chopin when you're done. Look
     who showed up for the final movement.

  KIM
     Excuse me?

  PARIS
     Just a little late for the joke, as well as the
     job.

  KIM
     I was checking the manifolds in segment twenty
     two.

  ANNOTATION
     Tal enters, and a shake makes her stagger.

  JIPPEQ
     Warp reaction's destabilising. Tal?

  TAL
     I can't find the problem.

  JANEWAY
     We're less than a minute away from multiple core
     breaches. Abort the transfer.

  JIPPEQ
     So much for finger crossing.

  JANEWAY
     B'Elanna?

  TORRES
     I'm reading microfractures all over the hull.

  JIPPEQ
     Why couldn't we detect that before?

  JANEWAY
     Good question. We'll have to check the hulls in
     each of your vessel's segments.

  JIPPEQ
     But that'll take days.

  JANEWAY
     The sooner we start, the sooner we finish.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Tiny Voyager is docked at a strut.

  PARIS
     Friendly people.

  KIM
     They've had a lot of bad experiences with other
     species.

  PARIS
     Well, I don't know. It seems like your first
     contact went pretty well.

  KIM
     What's that supposed to mean?

  PARIS
     I was just wondering where you disappeared to
     today.

  KIM
     I told you. I was checking the plasma conduits

  PARIS
     In segment twenty two, I know. They must have
     sonic showers over there. You're a lot cleaner
     than you were when you left. You are such a lousy
     liar. Haven't you learned anything from me after
     five years? She's cute.

  KIM
     Who.

  PARIS
     That assistant engineer, Tal.

  KIM
     Cute enough.

  PARIS
     Oh, here we go again.

  KIM
     What?

  PARIS
     You, going after impossible women. A hologram, an
     ex-Borg, the wrong twin, and now a girl from a
     xenophobic species?

  KIM
     You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm putting
     her out of my mind, I promise.

  PARIS
     Good. Glad to hear it. I'm due back on the bridge.

  KIM
     See you in the morning.


LOCATION--Kim's quarters

  KIM
     Computer, open a channel to Varro ship, segment
     sixteen, station two oh four. Encode transmission
     with security code alpha seven.

  COMPUTER
     Channel open.

  TAL [on monitor]
     What took you so long? I've been waiting twenty
     two minutes for you to call.

  KIM
     I was testing myself. Seeing how long I could
     resist calling you.

  TAL [on monitor]
     And?

  KIM
     I lasted twenty two minutes.

  TAL [on monitor]
     Should I feel complimented or insulted?

  KIM
     Since this is the first chance I've had to open a
     comm. link, complimented.

  TAL [on monitor]
     So you liked what happened?


LOCATION--Varro ship - Tal's cabin

  KIM [on monitor]
     Yeah, a lot.

  TAL
     Enough to try it again?

  KIM [on monitor]
     Absolutely. I've got to be honest, I wasn't
     expecting something so different.

  TAL
     Neither was I. Our species look so similar. Well,
     at least on the surface.

  KIM [on monitor]
     I would've never guessed when it came down to the
     basics. Well, let's just say the birds and bees
     would be very confused.

  TAL
     The birds and bees?


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     I'm telling you, you should take a look at their
     database. They've got some pretty amazing stuff on
     that ship.

  TUVOK
     Stuff?

  PARIS
     Their environmental control system, for instance.
     It's completely regenerative. Zero waste.

  TUVOK
     Impressive.

  PARIS
     It can be programmed to create almost any habitat.
     If you wanted to, you could recreate Vulcan in
     your quarters with that system.

  TUVOK
     Why would I want to?

  PARIS
     A little taste of home in the Delta Quadrant?
     Think about it. Springtime on the shores of Lake
     Yaron.

  TUVOK
     I require a desk and a bed. Nothing more.

  PARIS
     You're missing the point.

  TUVOK
     No doubt.

  PARIS
     These people have been travelling for four hundred
     years. They've learned a thing or two about living
     comfortably.

  TUVOK
     Our systems are more than adequate.

  PARIS
     Oh, I give up.

  CHAKOTAY
     After only two minutes? Tuvok, how do you do it?

  TUVOK
     I wait until his own illogic overwhelms him. I'm
     detecting an unauthorised transmission.

  CHAKOTAY
     Origin?

  TUVOK
     Unknown. It's been encoded.

  CHAKOTAY
     Find out where it's going.


LOCATION--Kim's quarters

  KIM
     Where would you most like to be right now?

  TAL [on monitor]
     Besides your quarters?

  KIM
     Besides my quarters.

  TAL [on monitor]
     On a distant moon, where the air is warm and the
     gravity is light. No bulkheads around me. Where,
     if I walk too quickly, I can almost fly.

  KIM
     I like that.

  TAL [on monitor]
     What about you? Where would you most want to be
     right now?

  KIM
     Besides your cabin?

  TAL [on monitor]
     Besides my cabin.

  KIM
     Sorry, I can't come up with anything better than
     your cabin.

  TAL [on monitor]
     And what would you do if you were here?

  KIM
     Now?

  TAL [on monitor]
     This very moment.

  KIM
     I'd ask you to dim the lights.

  TAL [on monitor]
     And what if I said no?

  KIM
     Okay, so we leave the lights on.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUVOK
     The message is being sent to the Varro ship,
     segment sixteen.

  CHAKOTAY
     Living quarters.

  PARIS
     Er, Commander? I think I can track that down for
     you. Hold on, something's wrong. I'm losing the
     signal.


LOCATION--Kim's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The image on the monitor breaks up.

  KIM
     Tal?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUVOK
     The transmission has ended.

  PARIS
     If it was a transmission. It could have just been
     a glitch in the comm. system.

  CHAKOTAY
     Run a diagnostic.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  CHAKOTAY
     Finding the source of these structural problems
     isn't going to be easy. They've already scanned
     most of their ship and come up empty. I'm hoping
     we'll do a better job.

  TUVOK
     We should form smaller teams to maximise
     efficiency.

  CHAKOTAY
     Agreed. We'll work in pairs. Now, what I'd like to
     do is start with their reactor bay, where we first
     detected the problem. (continues under dialogue)

  PARIS
     You owe me.

  KIM
     What?

  PARIS
     Eyes front. Last night I had to sabotage the comm.
     system to cover your tracks. You called her,
     didn't you?

  KIM
     Guilty.

  PARIS
     How long has this been going on? The truth.

  KIM
     From the moment we first saw each other. It was
     like touching an open plasma relay.

  PARIS
     Sounds serious.

  KIM
     Maybe it is.

  PARIS
     Has it occurred to you that you're breaking a few
     dozen protocols?

  KIM
     We know what we're getting into.

  CHAKOTAY
     Dismissed.

  PARIS
     Do you?

  SEVEN
     Our duty assignment. We're to survey the
     generational ship from Astrometrics.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  SEVEN
     Team alpha and gamma have finished scanning
     sections one through sixty four.

  KIM
     Kind of puts a Borg cube to shame, doesn't it?

  SEVEN
     The vessel's technology is impressive, but its
     construction is haphazard.

  KIM
     I guess they sort of improvised as they went
     along. Seven, you've been around humans for a
     while now. What do you think about love?

  SEVEN
     We're scanning for microfractures. I don't see the
     relevance.

  KIM
     Just curious.

  SEVEN
     Parental love, romantic love, affection between
     friends. Specify.

  KIM
     Romantic love.

  SEVEN
     An attraction based on sexual desire when it
     facilitates procreation.

  KIM
     I guess I'm asking the wrong person.

  SEVEN
     Not at all. The Borg have referenced this
     condition in over six thousand assimilated
     species.

  KIM
     Condition? You make it sound like a disease.

  SEVEN
     Physiologically, it bears a striking similarity to
     disease. A series of biochemical responses that
     trigger an emotional cascade impairing normal
     functioning.

  KIM
     Forget it.

  SEVEN
     Are you in love, Ensign?

  KIM
     I guess that's what I've been asking myself.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim gasps as a light flickers over his face.

  SEVEN
     You're glowing.

  KIM
     I beg your pardon?

  SEVEN
     Your epidermis luminesced.

  KIM
     Oh, it must be the lighting in here.

  SEVEN
     No, it was you.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees the effect on his hand.
