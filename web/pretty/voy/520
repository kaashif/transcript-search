LOCATION--Malon Freighter control room

  ANNOTATION
     Pelk is playing with a model freighter.

  PELK
     Zeeesh. Alert, alert, decompression on platform
     six eight four. Brace for hull rupture. Thrusters
     are down. We're going to crash! Ahhh. Hey, what do
     you think? Look at the detail on the dorsal
     plating.

  FESEK
     Impressive. Are you sure you're willing to part
     with it?

  PELK
     I just hope your boy enjoys it as much as I do.

  FESEK
     I'm certain he will, if we make it home in time
     for his birthday.

  PELK
     We'll make it.

  FESEK
     If you and Savar had a child of your own, you'd
     have an excuse to play with toys more often.

  ANNOTATION
     Rumble, alarm.

  PELK
     I'm detecting a fluctuation in tank four. There's
     a full scale rupture in progress.

  FESEK
     Isolate the deck. Activate the emergency
     containment field.

  PELK
     The emergency systems are offline.

  FESEK
     Backup controls are down too. Eject the tank.

  PELK
     Here? There's an inhabited system.

  FESEK
     We have no choice!

  PELK
     The ejection ports aren't responding.

  FESEK
     Impossible.

  DREMK
     There's another rupture forming in tank six.

  FESEK
     We'll have to send somebody down there to seal off
     the tanks manually. Contact the theta core.

  PELK
     Communications are down.

  FESEK
     Get down to the injector pod and seal those tanks.

  DREMK
     I didn't sign up for core labour.

  FESEK
     I'm giving you an order.

  DREMK
     I'll be contaminated.

  FESEK
     Now!


LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok is giving a lesson in meditation.

  TUVOK
     The flame, like emotion, is a primitive force.
     Left unchecked, it's chaotic, destructive. But if
     controlled it can be a powerful tool. The lamp
     controls the flame, as you must learn to control
     your emotions.

  TORRES
     I lost my temper. No big deal.

  TUVOK
     You destroyed the Doctor's holographic camera.

  TORRES
     I told him three times to leave Engineering, but
     he kept buzzing around snapping pictures for some
     photo essay.

  TUVOK
     A day in the life of the warp core.

  TORRES
     I apologised, and I replicated him a new camera.

  TUVOK
     You have a long history of emotional volatility.
     The point of this exercise is not to atone for
     past transgressions, but to prevent future ones.

  TORRES
     You can't order someone to meditate.

  TUVOK
     Commander Chakotay thinks otherwise.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres kneels opposite Tuvok.

  TORRES
     Are my eyes supposed to be open or closed for this
     part.

  TUVOK
     Whichever allows you to focus your mind.

  ANNOTATION
     She closes them.

  TUVOK
     Envision the flame burning within you.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres laughs.

  TORRES
     Sorry.

  TUVOK
     The flame grows hotter. A point of white light.
     Follow it backward through the years to a time
     when you were younger, a child. Is there something
     amusing, Lieutenant?

  TORRES
     I'm sorry, an image just flashed through my mind.
     You as a child, those pointy little ears. You must
     have been cute.

  TUVOK
     Indeed. Please follow my instructions or we'll
     discontinue this exercise.

  TORRES
     Right. Me, childhood. How old?

  TUVOK
     Your earliest memories. Try to recall a time when
     you experienced uncontrollable anger.

  TORRES
     Daniel Byrd.

  TUVOK
     I beg your pardon?

  TORRES
     He was one of my classmates in grammar school. He
     was always terrorising me. He used to point at my
     cranial ridges and tease me about being half
     Klingon. He called me Miss Turtlehead.

  TUVOK
     That angered you.

  TORRES
     Of course, it did. So I attacked him once, during
     recess, on the gyro-swing. I disengaged the
     centrifugal governor. He was spinning so fast, he
     almost flew apart. Then I yanked him off the swing
     and started pounding his little face! If Miss
     Malvin hadn't showed up, I probably would have

  TUVOK
     Describe the anger you felt at that moment.

  TORRES
     I, I wanted to hurt him. To take revenge for all
     the humiliation he caused me.

  TUVOK
     Your anger was a source of strength. It protected
     you, gave you courage.

  TORRES
     I suppose it did.

  TUVOK
     And when the Doctor tried to take a
     holo-photograph of you?

  TORRES
     I was annoyed. He kept getting in the way.

  TUVOK
     The rage within you runs deep. It's been with you
     for many years.

  TORRES
     I'm not a Vulcan. I'll survive.

  TUVOK
     Whatever you say, Miss Turtlehead.

  TORRES
     What did you say!

  TUVOK
     You're easily provoked. You must learn to master
     your emotions.

  TORRES
     I've had enough mastery for one day. School's out.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     So, how'd it go with B'Elanna today?

  TUVOK
     Our meditation sessions are confidential.

  PARIS
     No, I'm not asking for sordid details. I just want
     to know if you think you can help her.

  TUVOK
     Her training will be a challenge for both of us.

  PARIS
     Take it from me, getting B'Elanna to control her
     temper is like convincing a Ferengi to leave his
     estate to charity.

  KIM
     Captain, we're receiving an automated distress
     call.

  JANEWAY
     Origin?

  KIM
     Coordinates one twenty one by two six eight.
     Range, two billion kilometres.

  CHAKOTAY
     Who's sending it?

  KIM
     I can't tell.

  JANEWAY
     Let them know help's on the way. Set a course,
     Mister Paris.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, they arrive at the coordinates.

  TUVOK
     Thirty seven escape pods.

  PARIS
     They're contaminated with theta radiation.

  CHAKOTAY
     Malon?

  JANEWAY
     Possibly. Lifesigns?

  KIM
     Two, but they're erratic.

  JANEWAY
     Beam them to Sickbay. Initiate bio-hazard
     containment procedures.

  TUVOK
     Theta radiation has affected a radius of six
     hundred million kilometres.

  JANEWAY
     Source?

  TUVOK
     A Malon freighter travelling at high impulse. It
     appears to be abandoned.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TUVOK
     I thought we'd seen the last of the Malon.

  JANEWAY
     I guess they're looking for new places to dump
     their toxic waste.

  EMH
     Do we know what happened to their ship? Were they
     attacked?

  JANEWAY
     I'm just as curious as you are. Can you revive
     either of them? I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

  FESEK
     Fesek. Controller Fesek. Where am I?

  JANEWAY
     You're on my vessel. We responded to your distress
     call.

  FESEK
     My ship?

  JANEWAY
     It's heavily damaged.

  FESEK
     Where?

  TUVOK
     Three million kilometres from here.

  FESEK
     That's too close. We've got to get further away.

  JANEWAY
     Calm down, calm down. Tell me what's wrong with
     your ship. Why did you abandon it?

  FESEK
     We were on a waste export mission.

  TUVOK
     Dumping theta radiation.

  FESEK
     Two of the theta tanks ruptured. Systems
     malfunctioned one by one, communications,
     navigation, propulsion. We had no choice.
     Radiation was venting from every port. Over sixty
     crewmen died within minutes. It was chaos. We
     stumbled through the gas to get to the escape
     pods. Only a few of us made it. Where are the
     others?

  JANEWAY
     The two of you were the only ones we found alive.

  FESEK
     Listen to me very carefully. The fact that we're
     still here means the ship hasn't exploded, yet.
     When it does, over four trillion isotons of
     antimatter waste is going to ignite. Everything
     within three light years will be destroyed.

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to the bridge.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Go ahead.

  JANEWAY
     Put at least five light years between us and the
     Malon freighter.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Quickly.

  CHAKOTAY
     You heard her, Tom.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Send out a sector wide alert.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  JANEWAY
     Warn any other ships in the vicinity to


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Evacuate immediately.

  PARIS
     Our warp field just collapsed.
