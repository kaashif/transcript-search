LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH is singing Rigoletto con gusto.

  EMH
     Questa o quella per me pari sono a quant'altre
     d'intorno mi vedo, del mio core l'impero non cedo
     meglio ad una che ad altre belta. La costoro
     avvenenza e qual dono di che ilfato ne infiora la
     vita. S'oggi questa mi torna gradita, forse
     un'altra, forse un'altra.

  ANNOTATION
     During this vigorous recital, Janeway enters from
     the aft compartment with a face like thunder. He
     feels the vibes and stops.

  EMH
     Captain. Computer, pause music. I didn't wake you,
     did I?

  JANEWAY
     That's all right, Doctor. Fifteen minutes of sleep
     is really all I need. Coffee, black. Maybe you
     should pay a little more attention to flying and a
     little less to singing.

  EMH
     As a hologram, I can handle a variety of tasks at
     once. In addition to piloting the Flyer, I'm
     writing a paper on the physiological stresses of
     long duration space flight, and taking holo-images
     of this Mutara class nebula.

  JANEWAY
     With a hologram on board, who needs a crew?

  EMH
     I'd never admit this to anyone else, but there was
     a time when I would have given anything to be
     flesh and blood. But I've come to realise that
     being a hologram is far superior.

  JANEWAY
     Really?

  EMH
     No offence. I'll always enjoy the company of
     organics. In fact, I'm delighted you were able to
     attend this medical symposium with me. It's been a
     pleasure spending time with you. Actually, I was
     hoping we might do this sort of thing more often.

  ANNOTATION
     Shudder, beep.

  EMH
     Hmm. We're passing through a subspace eddy.

  JANEWAY
     It could be the wake of another ship.

  EMH
     No, there's nothing on sensors. It's probably just
     the gravimetric shear from the nebula.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe I should take the controls.

  EMH
     Sit down and relax, Captain. You've got a hologram
     at the helm.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     The plasma surges have to be coming from one of
     these relays. (to Vorik) Try realigning the
     deuterium manifolds.

  ANNOTATION
     A relay shorts out.

  PARIS [OC]
     Paris to Torres.

  TORRES
     Go ahead.

  PARIS [OC]
     Can you pull yourself away from engineering for a
     few minutes? I've got a shuttle down here with
     faulty deflector array.

  TORRES
     I'm a little busy right now.

  PARIS [OC]
     It's kind of urgent.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     In the shuttlebay. Paris is wearing a very
     brightly patterned shirt, and unpacking a picnic.

  TORRES
     What's this?

  PARIS
     Well, I thought you'd enjoy a romantic lunch under
     the glow of a red giant.

  TORRES
     Oh, you replicated potato salad.

  PARIS
     With extra paprika, just the way you like it.

  TORRES
     This is so sweet. But I can't.

  PARIS
     Sure you can. I've already cleared it with
     Chakotay.

  TORRES
     I told the captain I'd have the dilithium matrix
     recalibrated before she got back.

  PARIS
     You know, this might be our last chance to be
     alone for the next eighteen years.

  ANNOTATION
     In between kisses.

  TORRES
     I will make some time before the baby comes, I
     promise. Oh, I've got to get back.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Kim is in the Captain's chair and Ayala is at the
     helm.

  KIM
     Report.

  AYALA
     There's some kind of pulse being directed at our
     transceiver array. It's coming from the Delta
     Flyer.

  KIM
     Hail them.

  AYALA
     No response.

  KIM
     Looks like they've encoded the pulse with a comm.
     signal.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts the signal on the viewscreen.

  KIM
     Captain.

  JANEWAY [on viewscreen]
     Sorry about the image, Ensign. Our comm. system's
     been damaged. The only way I could send you a
     signal was through the main deflector.

  KIM
     Are you and the Doctor all right?

  JANEWAY [on viewscreen]
     We're fine. Tell Commander Chakotay to meet me in
     my ready room as soon as we've docked. Janeway
     out.


LOCATION--Ready room

  CHAKOTAY
     Harry tells me the Flyer took some damage.

  JANEWAY
     That's an understatement. We almost didn't make it
     back in one piece. They're called the R'Kaal.
     Their technology is decades ahead of ours.
     Transphasic warp drive, multi-spectral cloaking
     systems. They could destroy this ship before our
     sensors knew they were there.

  CHAKOTAY
     They sound like people we should avoid.

  JANEWAY
     I wish that were possible. They control thousands
     of parsecs from here to the edge of the Beta
     Quadrant. They're ecological extremists. They
     believe conventional warp engines damage subspace,
     so they've outlawed warp travel through their
     territory.

  CHAKOTAY
     Then we should reverse course and find a way
     around.

  JANEWAY
     That's the problem. We've already been in their
     space for three weeks without knowing it.

  CHAKOTAY
     You'd think they'd mark their borders a little
     more clearly.

  JANEWAY
     As punishment, their law demands that our ship be
     dismantled.

  CHAKOTAY
     Obviously we're not going to let that happen.

  JANEWAY
     I spent three hours explaining our situation to
     their Supreme Archon, a thoroughly unpleasant man.
     I convinced him to spare Voyager, but at a price.
     We're going to rendezvous with their armada and
     surrender our warp core at a class M planet where
     they've agreed to let us settle.

  CHAKOTAY
     Settle?

  JANEWAY
     I didn't make this decision lightly, Chakotay.

  CHAKOTAY
     We have to bring the senior staff in on this. We
     can find a way to evade their ships, or adapt our
     sensors to their cloaking technology.

  JANEWAY
     We could try that, and we might make it past their
     armada, but we could lose a lot of people in the
     process. Maybe the entire ship.

  CHAKOTAY
     Kathryn, there's got to be another way.

  JANEWAY
     I'm tired, Chakotay. Tired of casualty reports, of
     continually risking my people on the slim chance
     that we'll make it home in one piece.

  CHAKOTAY
     We've found our way out of worse situations.

  JANEWAY
     Set a course.

  CHAKOTAY
     What am I supposed to tell the crew?

  JANEWAY
     For now, I'd like to keep this between us.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's not like you to keep your people in the dark

  JANEWAY
     I'll make an announcement when the time is right.
     Dismissed.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     Captain.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry to interrupt, but I could use your input
     on a hypothetical scenario.

  TORRES
     Of course.

  JANEWAY
     If we were to eject the core, could it be towed
     safely at warp?

  TORRES
     In theory. But a tractor beam might destabilise
     the containment field. You'd be risking a breach.

  JANEWAY
     Could you compensate for that?

  TORRES
     You could configure the tractor emitters to
     generate a resonance pulse. That should stabilise
     the field.

  JANEWAY
     Can you make those modifications to the Delta
     Flyer's tractor emitters?

  TORRES
     I suppose.

  JANEWAY
     How long would it take?

  TORRES
     Er, a few hours.

  JANEWAY
     Get started.

  TORRES
     I thought this was a hypothetical scenario.

  JANEWAY
     We should be prepared, just in case.

  TORRES
     In case of what?

  JANEWAY
     Let me know as soon as you're finished.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway leaves.

  TORRES
     Torres to Chakotay.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Go ahead.

  TORRES
     Have you got a minute?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay sits and talks quietly.

  CHAKOTAY
     B'Elanna tells me you ordered some modifications
     to the Flyer.

  JANEWAY
     That's right.

  CHAKOTAY
     Maybe I misunderstood. I thought the plan was to
     hand over the core when we reached the planet. Are
     we taking it somewhere else?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway looks down to her right and whispers.

  JANEWAY
     I heard you the first time.

  CHAKOTAY
     Captain?

  JANEWAY
     You've already made your concerns clear,
     Commander, but there's been a slight change of
     plans.

  CHAKOTAY
     Were you going to tell me? Kathryn, what's going
     on?

  JANEWAY
     I don't feel well. I've got a headache. I'm going
     to my quarters and I'd prefer not to be disturbed.
     You have the bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     As she passes Tuvok.

  JANEWAY
     Not now.

  TUVOK
     I beg your pardon, Captain?

  JANEWAY
     Carry on, Commander.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to the Doctor.

  EMH [OC]
     Go ahead, Commander.

  CHAKOTAY
     Report to Sickbay immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH beams in.

  CHAKOTAY
     Something wrong with the turbolifts?

  EMH
     You did say immediately. How can I help you?

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm concerned about the Captain. She doesn't seem
     to be feeling well.

  EMH
     What's wrong?

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm not sure. She went to her quarters with a
     headache.

  EMH
     I'll bring her an analgesic.

  CHAKOTAY
     I was wondering if this could be related to your
     encounter with the aliens.

  EMH
     You think they harmed her?

  CHAKOTAY
     You tell me. What did they do to her?

  EMH
     I'm not sure, exactly. The aliens took my
     programme offline as soon as they boarded the
     Flyer. The captain reactivated me a few hours
     later and told me she'd been interrogated.
     Naturally, I examined her to make sure she was all
     right.

  CHAKOTAY
     Did you find anything unusual?

  EMH
     I suppose I'm violating doctor-patient
     confidentiality by telling you this but, she was
     fine.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'd like you to give her a more thorough
     examination.

  EMH
     Gladly. But you know how she feels about
     physicals.

  CHAKOTAY
     You can be very persuasive, Doctor. Contact me as
     soon as you're done.

  EMH
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  CHAKOTAY
     Anything interesting on sensors this morning?

  SEVEN
     Nothing extraordinary. A red giant and two G type
     stars, a Golorian trading vessel bearing one five
     six mark four.

  CHAKOTAY
     If there were a fleet of cloaked ships in the
     vicinity, could you devise a way to detect them?

  SEVEN
     A cloaked fleet would generate significant
     subspace distortions. Why do you ask?

  KIM [OC]
     Commander, we're receiving a transmission.

  CHAKOTAY
     Source?

  KIM [OC]
     I'm having trouble pinpointing it. Should I notify
     the captain?

  CHAKOTAY
     No, she didn't want to be disturbed. Route the
     call here.

  ANNOTATION
     A reptilian alien appears.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm Commander Chakotay of the starship Voyager.

  LOTH [on screen]
     This is Supreme Archon Loth of the R'Kaal
     Imperium. Why haven't you ejected your warp core
     as your captain agreed?

  CHAKOTAY
     We're en route to the planet you specified. We
     can't jettison the core until we get there.

  LOTH [on screen]
     If we don't receive the core within ten hours, my
     armada will destroy your ship. This is your only
     warning.

  CHAKOTAY
     Work with Harry. I want to know the source of that
     transmission.

  SEVEN
     Understood.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Ah, Commander. You'll be relieved to know I've
     given the captain a clean bill of health.

  CHAKOTAY
     Did you run a neurological scan?

  EMH
     Mmm hmm. Her brain activity and cognitive
     functions are completely normal. As far as I can
     tell she's perfectly fit, physically and mentally.

  CHAKOTAY
     Thank you, Doctor.


LOCATION--Outside Janeway's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay rings the doorbell, but there is no
     answer.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to the captain. Computer, locate Captain
     Janeway.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway walks around the corner.

  JANEWAY
     Computer, belay that. My quarters, now.


LOCATION--Janeway's quarters

  JANEWAY
     Really, Chakotay. Sending the Doctor to check up
     on me.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm concerned.

  JANEWAY
     Then why didn't you come to me directly? I thought
     we trusted each other.

  CHAKOTAY
     So did I. Something happened on that away mission
     that you're not telling me.

  JANEWAY
     I've told you everything you need to know.

  CHAKOTAY
     You've consulted me on every major decision over
     the last seven years, except this one. Why?

  JANEWAY
     There are some decisions a captain has to make on
     her own.

  CHAKOTAY
     I understand that, but every instinct tells me
     what you're doing is wrong. Don't you remember
     what happened on Lesik Prime?

  JANEWAY
     I don't see how that's relevant.

  CHAKOTAY
     I think you do. Fifteen years ago, you were the
     lieutenant who was kept in the dark. If you hadn't
     questioned your captain's orders, the entire away
     team would have been lost.

  JANEWAY
     This situation's entirely different.

  CHAKOTAY
     You never told me that story. I made it up.
     Chakotay to Tuvok.

  JANEWAY
     I've erected a dampening field around these
     quarters. I'm sorry, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway overpowers Chakotay and uses a hypospray
     to knock him out.


LOCATION--Morgue

  JANEWAY
     Computer, secure the doors and establish a level
     five dampening field around the morgue.

  ANNOTATION
     She opens one stasis chamber and beams Chakotay
     into it. Then she takes his comm. badge and closes
     the chamber.


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  JANEWAY
     I can't do my job with the two of you constantly
     talking in my head.

  ANNOTATION
     She puts her foot up on the desk to reveal the
     mobile emitter attached to the top of her boot.
     Then she morphs into the EMH.

  EMH
     No. I'm not doing anything else until I speak with
     the captain. Fine. What's your encryption
     frequency?


LOCATION--Overlooker's ship

  EMH [on monitor]
     Captain, are you all right?

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, listen to me. Under no circumstances are
     you to eject the warp core.

  EMH [on monitor]
     If I don't do what they ask, they'll kill you.

  JANEWAY
     I'm giving you a direct order. Stop what you're
     doing.

  EMH [on monitor]
     I'm sorry, Captain. I can't obey that order.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, I want you to go to the bridge right now
     and alert Commander Tuvok.

  ANNOTATION
     There are two members of the Heirarchy here, and
     they still remind me of Vogons. Thanks, Douglas
     Adams.

  ZET
     Put her behind the forcefield.

  ANNOTATION
     His companion obeys.

  ZET
     We have another assignment for you. I've been
     going over the schematics of your vessel, and I'm
     intrigued by this bio-neural circuitry. I want you
     to bring us a series of these gel packs.

  EMH [on monitor]
     The gel packs are integrated into the ship's
     systems. I can't just remove them without someone
     noticing.

  ZET
     You've proven yourself to be very resourceful,
     Doctor. You'll find a way. Remember, we're
     monitoring your perceptual subroutines. We can see
     and hear everything.


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  TUVOK [OC]
     Tuvok to Chakotay.

  ZET [on monitor]
     You know what will happen to her if you alert your
     crew.

  EMH
     (croaky voice) Go ahead.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     In the shuttlebay.

  TUVOK
     Are you all right, Commander?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Just a scratchy throat. The Doctor's treating me
     now.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  TUVOK
     Could you come to the Shuttlebay when you're
     finished?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     I'll be right there. Chakotay out. Computer,
     access the holodeck database and locate Commander
     Chakotay's holographic template. Download the
     physical parameters into my programme.

  ANNOTATION
     He morphs himself into Chakotay and puts the comm.
     badge on.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  EMH-CHAKOTAY
     You wanted to see me?

  TUVOK
     I've completed the diagnostic as you requested.
     The Flyer's comm. system is functioning normally.

  EMH-CHAKOTAY
     You find that unusual?

  TUVOK
     The Captain did report that it was damaged


LOCATION--Overlooker's ship

  TUVOK [OC]
     During the attack by the R'Kaal.

  EMH-CHAKOTAY [OC]
     I'll have a talk with her. Did you find anything
     else out of the ordinary?

  TUVOK [OC]
     No.

  ZET
     Get out of there before you arouse suspicion.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  EMH-CHAKOTAY
     I'll be on the bridge if you need me.


LOCATION--Overlooker's ship

  NAR
     You're doing a wonderful job, Doctor. I'm just
     giving him a little encouragement.

  ZET
     That's why I'm in command.

  NAR
     If all goes well, we should have the warp core in
     less than six hours. He's making excellent
     progress.

  JANEWAY
     That's exactly what he wants you to believe.

  ZET
     What do you mean?

  JANEWAY
     Did you really think you could outsmart a
     hologram?

  NAR
     Everything appears to be normal.

  JANEWAY
     How do you know you're not looking at a
     holographic projection? The Doctor isn't just a
     physician. His Emergency Command subroutines
     contain thousands of tactical scenarios. I
     wouldn't be surprised if Voyager was already on
     its way here. You do have an option. Leave me
     behind in an escape pod and I'll forget any of
     this ever happened.

  NAR
     Maybe we should let her go.

  ZET
     Are you delusional? It took months to plan this.
     We've already found a buyer for the warp core. Now
     you want to abandon everything?

  NAR
     It's better than being sent to a rehabilitation
     centre.

  ZET
     We made our choice when we stole this vessel. I am
     not going back to the Hierarchy, and neither are
     you. She's just trying to trick you. A month from
     now, we'll be soaking in the mud baths of Eblar
     Prime. Trust me.


LOCATION--Janeway's quarters
