Transphasic warp drive, multi-spectral cloaking systems. They could destroy this ship before our sensors knew they were there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I spent three hours explaining our situation to their Supreme Archon, a thoroughly unpleasant man. I convinced him to spare Voyager, but at a price. We're going to rendezvous with their armada and surrender our warp core at a class M planet where they've agreed to let us settle.</td></tr>
