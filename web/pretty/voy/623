TEASER

LOCATION--Open air theatre

  SOMEONE
     Lit by torches, a Greek Chorus is declaiming their
     part of the play for their rapt audience.)

  CHORUS
     Captain's log, stardate 53896. B'Elanna Torres has
     requested permission to take the Delta Flyer and
     search for dilithium. Shining Voyager, far from
     home, far from the gleaming cities of Earth.

  KELIS
     Headstrong B'Elanna Torres, and young Harry Kim,
     speed away from Voyager on the Delta Flyer in
     search of their treasures.

  ANNOTATION
     The principals hold masks in front of their faces
     that represent the characters. Yes, the Torres one
     does have a ridged forehead.

  JERO
     I've trimmed the sails but the sea is rough. Maybe
     we should return.

  LAYNA
     I know what I'm doing.

  CHORUS
     A wave as high as a mountain struck the Delta
     Flyer.

  LAYNA
     Get into the escape pod.

  JERO
     We die together.

  LAYNA
     No one is going to die. Go.

  CHORUS
     Young Harry Kim left her side and B'Elanna Torres
     was thrown against the rocks, the rocks of our
     very shore.

  KELIS
     Which is where I, Kelis the poet, found her.
     Broken, dying. She told me her story, and now I've
     told you.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone waits with bated breath for one man to
     applaud. When he does, they join in
     enthusiastically.

  AUTARCH
     An excellent conceit, that you discovered her
     yourself.

  KELIS
     Thank you.

  AUTARCH
     Well, now that B'Elanna Torres has come to our
     shore, what will happen? Does Captain Janeway come
     searching for her, or does she give her up for
     lost?

  KELIS
     Who can say?

  AUTARCH
     Well, I would hope that you can. I want to see
     more of these Voyager Eternals.

  KELIS
     Inspiration can't be forced.

  AUTARCH
     One week.

  KELIS
     Or three weeks. Maybe two. One week. The story
     will continue. Have you noticed how thin my
     performers have gotten?

  AUTARCH
     Let them eat this.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws Kelis a jewel that was hanging around
     his consort's neck.


LOCATION--Backstage

  KELIS
     Ladies and gentlemen, our patron salutes you.

  JERO
     Finally!

  KELIS
     We're doing another Voyager play. As soon as I can
     write it.

  LAYNA
     Shall we celebrate, the two of us?

  KELIS
     I have very little time. Celebrating will have to
     wait.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - night

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer has crashed on a mountainside. Candles
     illuminate the inside. Torres is in the pilot's
     seat and her hands are tied. Kelis reaches forward
     with his knife to cut her bonds, and she hits him.

  TORRES
     Who are you?

  KELIS
     Kelis, Kelis the poet. Your servant.

  TORRES
     My servant? All right. Let me go.

  KELIS
     I can't.

  TORRES
     Why not?

  KELIS
     You'll fly from me, the way inspiration always
     does.

  TORRES
     You're trying to kill me.

  ANNOTATION
     There are cuts on her forearm.

  KELIS
     I'm releasing the heat from your veins.

  TORRES
     What are you talking about?

  KELIS
     You've been in a fever since I found you. Bleeding
     is the best way to treat it.

  TORRES
     Oh, I can see I'm in good hands.

  KELIS
     Something tells me you have your doubts.

  TORRES
     There's a medkit over there. A box, made out of
     metal. There's a small cylinder inside. Bring it
     here. Give it to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Kelis does. She turns it on.

  TORRES
     Don't be afraid, it won't hurt you. Here. Pass it
     over where you cut me.

  ANNOTATION
     The dermal regenerator heals the cuts.

  KELIS
     You're an Eternal. I suppose such things are to be
     expected.

  TORRES
     What other things do you expect from an Eternal?

  KELIS
     The power to make the ground open up and the sky
     to fall. All the strange events sung by the
     ancient poets. Fortunately for me, no poet has
     ever sung about your clan. I'm the first.

  TORRES
     My clan?

  KELIS
     The Eternals on Voyager. Shining Voyager, far from
     home.

  TORRES
     What do you know about that?

  TORRES [OC]
     Delta Flyer log, stardate 53918. Harry and I are
     continuing toward the fourth planet. Sensors have
     picked up natural dilithium deposits on nearly
     every land mass.

  ANNOTATION
     Fast forward.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Acknowledged. Has your warp core been damaged?

  TORRES [OC]
     Yes. We're running on thrusters. Can you track our
     position?

  TORRES
     How long have I been here?

  KELIS
     Eight days. I was walking through these mountains.
     I saw a light burn across the sky and I heard a
     terrible sound. When I arrived, I found you. I
     treated your wounds.

  TORRES
     And you tied me to this chair.

  KELIS
     When a gift falls from the heavens, only a fool
     would let her go. You've already given me one
     play. The story told by those voices. I pieced
     them together, tried to fill in the gaps.

  TORRES
     You made a play out of our logs?

  KELIS
     The Away Mission of B'Elanna Torres. My patron was
     impressed.

  TORRES
     He has great taste. Now take that knife of yours
     and cut me free.

  KELIS
     That would be unwise.

  TORRES
     Why?

  KELIS
     My patron is intrigued by the Voyager Eternals. He
     wants another play. To compose that, I need more
     details.

  TORRES
     And you expect to get them from me?

  KELIS
     I did save your life.

  TORRES
     I need to get back to Voyager.

  KELIS
     I need another play.

  TORRES
     What exactly do you want to know?

  KELIS
     Everything.

  TORRES
     It's not possible. We Eternals have our rules. We
     can't just give everything away.

  KELIS
     How did you get lost?

  TORRES
     Cut me free and I'll tell you.

  KELIS
     You won't leave me?

  TORRES
     Cut me free.

  ANNOTATION
     Kelis cuts the ropes. Torres picks up a phaser.

  TORRES
     You're the one who's leaving.

  ANNOTATION
     She fires the phaser at a tree branch, vaporising
     it.

  TORRES
     Don't come back.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - day

  TORRES
     Computer, bring the subspace transmitter online.

  COMPUTER
     Unable to comply.

  TORRES
     Why not?

  COMPUTER
     Insufficient power.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to another console, but

  TORRES
     Great. Now there's no power.

  KELIS
     Are you hungry?

  TORRES
     I told you not to come back.

  KELIS
     You haven't eaten in days. We have to support each
     other, we poets.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres takes the proffered berries.

  TORRES
     I'm an engineer. I fix things.

  KELIS
     From the looks of it, you're not doing so well.

  TORRES
     Are you a poet or a critic?

  KELIS
     Tell me about Earth.

  TORRES
     I have to sing for my supper, huh?

  KELIS
     We all do, in one way or another. Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     He offers her his bag of food.

  TORRES
     It's a, an island. A beautiful island, blue and
     green.

  KELIS
     And Voyager, a great ship?

  TORRES
     In a long line of great ships.

  KELIS
     How did Voyager get lost?

  TORRES
     The Caretaker.

  KELIS
     An Eternal?

  TORRES
     Yes, you could say that. He caused a storm, which
     blew us off course.

  KELIS
     Tom Paris. Are you in love with him?

  TORRES
     Supper is over. Come with me.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  ANNOTATION
     She sticks a portable power cell onto a panel.

  TORRES
     This is where we put all the names and dates when
     our heads won't hold any more.

  KELIS
     A memory.

  TORRES
     Exactly. Tell me, have you ever seen this before?

  ANNOTATION
     She calls up an image of a crystalline structure.

  KELIS
     Winter's tears.

  TORRES
     Can you get me some?

  KELIS
     This is dilithium, isn't it? What you were looking
     for?

  TORRES
     Where can I find it?

  KELIS
     The only deposit I know of is on the hunting
     grounds of my patron. He'd execute me for
     trespassing. And you, well, he'd love to capture
     an Eternal.

  TORRES
     Maybe I'm more powerful than he is.

  KELIS
     Perhaps, but if he caught you he'd force you to
     fight against his enemies. They're constantly at
     each other's throats. Bickering over territory,
     raiding each other's land, starting wars whenever
     they can be guaranteed of good weather. And we
     suffer the consequences. You don't want to get
     involved with them.

  TORRES
     Which is why you're going to get the dilithium.

  KELIS
     I told you, I'd be executed if I'm caught.

  TORRES
     The dilithium. Or I don't say another word about
     Shining Voyager, far from home.

  ANNOTATION
     A thunderstorm breaks overhead.

  KELIS
     Did you?

  TORRES
     Don't get caught.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - evening

  ANNOTATION
     It is still raining. Kelis returns.

  TORRES
     Well?

  ANNOTATION
     He hands her his bag, and she takes out a large
     chunk of crystal.

  TORRES
     Beautiful. I've got an idea for your next play.


LOCATION--Open Air Theatre

  KELIS
     I've been visited by inspiration herself. How does
     this sound? The Rescue of B'Elanna Torres. Right
     here, in one week.

  CHORUS 2
     One week?

  KELIS
     Let's get to work.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  JANEWAY
     Dismissed.

  PARIS
     That's it?

  EMH
     Mister Paris, try to stay calm.

  PARIS
     No, that's not going to happen. Isn't there
     anything else we can do?

  JANEWAY
     Not until something shows up on sensors.

  PARIS
     I'll take a shuttle out myself. I'll run a planet
     by planet search.

  SEVEN
     An inefficient plan.

  CHAKOTAY
     And too dangerous. You could be hit by the same
     spatial eddies that sent the Flyer off course.

  JANEWAY
     We need to concentrate our efforts from here, Tom.
     All right? Dismissed.


LOCATION--Open Air Theatre

  ANNOTATION
     The company are reading their new lines.

  CHORUS 1
     Steady-armed Paris, bound by a sleep that brings
     no rest.
