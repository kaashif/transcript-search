<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Well, it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the range of our radio. First thing tomorrow morning I want you to take a little trip to the countryside. There's a Monsieur Groleau who has a cottage just past the third bridge. He's got a wine cellar full of vacuum tubes. Tell him we need a high frequency oscillator. Offer him three hundred francs but don't go any higher than five hundred.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>SEVEN:  We have more pressing needs.</td></tr>

Three more German battalions have occupied the city and a Panzer division is holding position eleven kilometres away. When the Americans arrive and the fighting begins, I don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing Moonlight Becomes You.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  The Americans won't even be able to approach this city without our help. And if they can't liberate Sainte Claire the assault into Germany could fail. We need to be gathering information about German troop movements and relaying it to Allied Command.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>SEVEN:  I'm tired of lighting the Nazi's cigarettes and laughing at their jokes. We should be helping the Allies by assassinating these pigs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  The moment we start shooting we expose ourselves. Right now, no one suspects us. And I am not about to risk our entire operation because you've suddenly developed a nervous trigger finger.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>SEVEN:  That is your opinion, Madame.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'm the leader of the movement here and right now my opinion is the only one that counts, so get the oscillator. I think we're all feeling the strain. It's been a hard four years. But believe me, the Third Reich is feeling it too. We just have to hang on a little while longer. Word from the Americans is going to come any day.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>SEVEN:  Perhaps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  If you have suspicions, my old friend, let's hear them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>TUVOK:  From the beginning, she's been argumentative, and on more than a few occasions she's disobeyed your direct orders.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  She's headstrong. Typical of the underground.</td></tr>
