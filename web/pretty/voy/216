This is the most extraordinary thing anyone has ever done for me.</td></tr>

If we can increase the grafted tissue mass quickly enough, we can transfer her synaptic patterns back into her brain before they degrade in the holo-buffer. It won't cure the Phage, but it should prolong her life considerably. Please, change into a surgical gown and lie down on biobed number one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>DENARA:  I'm sure it is. Please understand this disease has been killing my people for hundreds of years. Trying to stop it has become an obsession, and many of our politicians and scientists have never developed compassion for the people who keep us alive.
