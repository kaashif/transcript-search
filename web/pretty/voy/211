<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>TORRES:  We're in bad shape Captain. We had to shut down the warp engines to avoid a breach. The impulse engines are gone too. I think I can give you thrusters but I've got a lot of casualties down here I've got to tend to first.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  We've had casualties on all decks, no fatalities so far.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>PARIS:  Captain, request permission to give Torres a hand in Engineering. Maybe I can help get propulsion up and running.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Captain, my readings indicate the navigational deflector has sustained massive damage. It will be necessary to repair it before we can achieve more than thruster power.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>EMH:  He's not responding. Seventy five milligrams of inpedrazine. That might help stimulate his cardiac functions, but he's sustained so much injury it may be too late.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'm sorry, Chakotay. I know you were friends. Will you arrange a memorial service?</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I'll get right on it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Was there something else?</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Yes. Like it or not, it seems we're in a situation where the rules have changed. And maybe, if we're going to survive out here, we have to start changing too.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  What do you mean?</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  When we first started our trip home, you made a conscious decision to treat Voyager as a Starfleet ship with a Starfleet crew following Starfleet rules.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  That's right.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Starfleet works well in the Alpha quadrant, but out here, maybe we should be thinking more like the Maquis. The Maquis had to survive on their own. We were up against insurmountable odds. We had to create our own opportunities for success, because nobody was willing to help us. Sound like anybody you know?</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  If you're suggesting we abandon our principles just because we're out of hailing range?</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Captain, this was the fourth attack in two weeks. We've lost three crew members to the Kazon, a dozen more have sustained serious injuries. The ship has taken so much damage we'll be lucky to get warp drive online again. And we can count on the fact that the Kazon will be back. I don't think we can afford to keep doing business as usual.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Mess hall</td></tr>
<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  A lot of us can say we're alive today because of Kurt Bendera. There was never a better man to have at your side, never anyone more willing to take on the tough jobs. The first time I met him was in a mining community on Telfas Prime. Some of the miners objected to my sense of humour and decided they should break a few of my bones. There were four of them and one of me, and I was taking a beating. Suddenly this man I'd never seen before came out of nowhere and evened things up. We stood back to back, and pretty soon the others decided my sense of humour wasn't so bad after all. I thanked the man. He just grinned and said, I like a good fight. He was my friend from that moment on, and he kept fighting the good fight right up to the end. I'll miss him. Ensign.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Everyone stands. The Ensign blows a bosun's pipe, presumably to pipe Bendera off the ship, and the service finishes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>HOGAN:  Captain, can I ask you something?</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Of course.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>HOGAN:  Now that the Kazon have stepped up their attacks, a lot of people think that we're not going to make it out of here alive. I'd like to know what you have to say about that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Is there anything you have to say about that? I assure you, you can speak freely.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>HOGAN:  I'd give them what they want. Give them the replicators and the transporters and whatever else it is they're after.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'm sure you realise that would be a violation of the Prime</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>HOGAN:  I know all about the Prime Directive, but you know what? The Federation is seventy thousand light years away. What does it matter what these people do to each other with our technology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I appreciate your concerns, crewman, but let me make it absolutely clear. I'll destroy this ship before I turn any part of it over to the Kazon. So that's how the Maquis would do it, hmm?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Corridor</td></tr>
<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  It's all right, Commander, I know Hogan's upset. He and Bendera were close.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  But that's not why he thinks we should give the Kazon what they want.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I think I've made my position clear on that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  You have, but a lot of the crew feel they haven't had the chance to voice their opinions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  This isn't a democracy, Chakotay. I can't run this ship by consensus.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  A lot of the Maquis feel the Federation abandoned them years ago. You may be willing to die for Federation principles, but they're not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I can't believe you'd support that man's position.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I don't. But isn't there something in between your position and his?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Turbolift</td></tr>
<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Deck three.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  All I'm saying, Captain, is that maybe there's a little room for flexibility in interpreting Starfleet's protocols. Frankly I'm not sure they were ever intended for situations like this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I haven't seen any evidence that they've let us down.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe this situation with the Kazon is the first example. Maybe we have to examine Starfleet's principles with a cold eye and ask ourselves if they're really applicable here.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Computer, hold turbolift. Commander, if you have a specific suggestion, please feel free to make it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Make a deal, an alliance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  With the Kazon?</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  With one of their factions, or two. If we had the Ogla and the Relora as our allies, the others would be afraid to touch us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Nothing we've been through with the Kazon would lead me to believe they're trustworthy. I can't imagine making a deal with them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  With all due respect, maybe that's because your imagination is limited by Starfleet protocols. As Captain, you're responsible for making decisions in the best interest of your crew, and I think you have to ask yourself if you're doing that.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters</td></tr>
<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Tuvok is tending his orchids when the doorbell rings.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Come in. Captain, this is unexpected.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I've been in your quarters before.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Indeed, but so rarely that I can remember each instance. Vulcan spice tea, hot. And it was always at a time when you were particularly troubled.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Right as usual. Thank you. Commander Chakotay has proposed that we make an alliance with one of the Kazon factions. We wouldn't give them weapons or technology, but we would pledge to support and defend them if they're attacked.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I am sure that made you uncomfortable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  How can I consider it? I can't just walk away from the precepts Starfleet has laid our for us. You don't deal with outlaws. You don't involve yourself in the political machinations of other cultures. It goes against everything I believe, everything I trained for, everything experience has taught me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Quite right.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Do I hear a however coming?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>TUVOK:  You are perceptive, Captain. I believe Commander Chakotay's suggestion does have merit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Help me understand that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>TUVOK:  When I was a young man, a great visionary named Spock recommended an alliance between the Federation and the Klingon empire. This produced a major dispute. The Klingons, after all, were outlaws, employing violence and brutality in order to build their empire. I myself spoke out against such a coalition. But the alliance was forged and it brought a stability to the quadrant that had not been there for two hundred years. Spock's suggestion, so controversial at first, proved to be the cornerstone of peace.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  There are some differences here. By allying ourselves to one faction, we'd be giving that faction more power than the others. That would clearly affect the internal politics of all the Kazon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I understand your concern, but remember, it would only be a temporary arrangement since we are on our way out of this quadrant. In the meantime, it might bring stability to the region and security for us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Once we're gone they'll probably go back to their in-fighting.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Perhaps. But even temporary stability can bring an appreciation for peace. This flower is a rare hybrid. As far as I know it exists nowhere else in the galaxy. I created it by grafting a cutting from a South American orchid onto a Vulcan favinit plant. I doubted the graft would take, and indeed the plant was sickly at first. However, after a few weeks both plants adapted to their new condition and in fact became stronger than either had been alone.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Briefing room</td></tr>
<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Consequently, after much consideration, I've decided to seek an alliance with one of the Kazon factions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>KIM:  Captain, you can't be serious. This goes against everything</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Ensign, I'll be glad to discuss my reasoning with you at a more appropriate time. However, this meeting is not to debate the decision but to decide how to pursue it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Captain, if I may?</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Yes, Mister Neelix.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>NEELIX:  We're not far from a planet known as Sobras, where there's a Kazon settlement inhabited by a faction known as the Pommar. I have an acquaintance there, someone who owes me some favours. Some rather large favours, actually. Perhaps I could meet with him and sound him out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Is he authorised to speak for his Maje?</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Not exactly, but he does have the Maje's ear. This would be strictly informal, but it might give us a reading on the possibility without the risk of actual confrontation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Good idea. Proceed, Mister Neelix.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>KIM:  Why don't we just contact Seska and form an alliance with her?</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>TORRES:  Actually that's a good idea.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  You've got to be kidding!</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>TORRES:  Not at all. Seska has been trying to forge an alliance among the Kazon. She would jump at the chance to get our support.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>PARIS:  She's right. If we went through Seska at least we could ally ourselves with the Nistrim.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I think it's a bad idea.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  You can't have it both ways Commander. If you want to get in the mud with the Kazon you can't start complaining that you might get dirty.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Fine. I'll talk with Seska.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  No, you've been through too much with her. Mister Neelix, prepare to take your shuttle to Sobras. In the meantime, I'll make contact with Seska. Dismissed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>SOMEONE: Captain's log, stardate 49337.4. After sending a subspace message to Seska and the Nistrim Maje Culluh, we have received a quick response.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>CULLUH [on viewscreen]:  You've made an interesting proposal. I've discussed it with Seska and she assures me that you would not make this gesture unless you were sincere. I will talk with you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L120"><td><a href="#L120">120</a></td><td>TERSA:  The dancer showed it to me. By moving only two rods this dodecahedron can become an icosahedron. She said she'd spend the night with the man who could solve it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L123"><td><a href="#L123">123</a></td><td>NEELIX:  I might, if you'll hear me out first. My fortunes have changed since we last met, Tersa. I've become a person of some influence aboard a starship known as Voyager.</td></tr>

<tr id="L124"><td><a href="#L124">124</a></td><td>TERSA:  You must think us very isolated. Everyone knows that. It's probably the only reason you were allowed in here. Especially after last time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L125"><td><a href="#L125">125</a></td><td>NEELIX:  A simple misunderstanding. Tersa, I know you have the ear of your First Maje, as I do with our Captain. We could be quite useful to both of them.</td></tr>

I was told they were violent and dangerous, and had to be kept isolated so they wouldn't get loose and kill us. Which is exactly what they did, but we brought it on ourselves. The Trabe treated them like animals, fenced them in, encouraged them to fight amongst themselves so they wouldn't turn on us, and sat by while they turned into a violent, angry army. When they finally realised we were their true enemy, we didn't stand a chance. I was luckier than most.

<tr id="L302"><td><a href="#L302">302</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I found the goals of the Trabe to be compatible with our own. I represent an organisation which is devoted to peaceful co-existence among people. The Trabe want nothing more than that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L304"><td><a href="#L304">304</a></td><td>CULLUH:  What I fear, Captain, is that this union you've made with the Trabe is an effort to force us to capitulate. If so, we assure you, it is doomed to failure.</td></tr>

<tr id="L305"><td><a href="#L305">305</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I won't pretend that our alliance wasn't an attempt to make a show of strength. Separately, we and the Trabe are vulnerable. Together, we are stronger.</td></tr>

<tr id="L307"><td><a href="#L307">307</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  It is important that you understand our determination, but it's not a threat, it's an offer. A negotiated peace among all of us would provide a greater stability in this quadrant. How could that do anything but benefit us all?</td></tr>

<tr id="L308"><td><a href="#L308">308</a></td><td>CULLUH:  I can't speak for all of you, but I for one don't think we can trust this proposal. A woman and a Trabe. How can we listen to them? I find you nothing but a hypocrite, Captain, allying yourselves to the greatest villains this quadrant has ever known.

Although some of the species we've encountered here have been peaceful, others seem governed only by their own self-interests. This appears to be a region of space that doesn't have many rules. But I believe we can learn something from the events that have unfolded. In a part of space where there are few rules, it's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where shifting allegiances are commonplace we have to have something stable to rely on. And we do. The principles and ideals of the Federation. As far as I'm concerned, those are the best allies we could have.</td></tr>
