<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>SEVEN:  The concept of relaxation is difficult for me to understand. As a Borg, my time was spent working at a specific task. When it was completed, I was assigned another. It was efficient.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Frankly, it's refreshing to take myself out of the twenty fourth century every now and then. And a little disorganisation can be very encouraging to the imagination. You might want to try it sometime.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  They aren't necessary, Seven. But they're an important part of one's life, because imagination frees the mind. It inspires ideas and solutions, and it can provide a great deal of pleasure. Human progress, the human mind itself, couldn't exist without them. When I was a child, I studied these drawings. I even built some of these models. Da Vinci was always a great inspiration to me.</td></tr>

Papa tried to fight them but they were too strong. I tried to hide. Maybe they wouldn't find me because I was little, but they did. And Papa said we were going to crash and the big man picked me up, and then suddenly we weren't on the ship anymore. We were somewhere else. And then I became Borg.</td></tr>
