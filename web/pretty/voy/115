<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>TUVOK:  There is one other matter I wish to discuss. I am concerned about Crewman Dalby. He attempted to make unauthorised repairs on a damaged gel pack. When I confronted him, he lost control.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Indeed. This is not the first incident involving Mister Dalby. Last week he was found tampering with ship's systems to increase a friends replicator rations, and he has missed three of his last ten duty shifts.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Dalby's always been pretty aggressive. My guess is the man's frustrated. He's not used to dealing with Starfleet protocol and procedures.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>TUVOK:  A starship cannot run without protocols. Mister Dalby's attitude is disrupting this vessels operations.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  What do you suggest? Dragging him in front of a disciplinary board?</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Perhaps that would be the best approach.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I doubt that's going to help. Dalby's not the only Maquis who's having problems adjusting. And besides, it's not only a matter of attitude, it's also a matter of experience. It's not fair to expect Starfleet behaviour from people who never went to the Academy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>TUVOK:  What do you propose?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  We need to bring some of these people up to speed. Instruct them in how to run a Starfleet vessel. Show them why we do things the way we do. Give them an opportunity to feel like they're part of the team.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Exactly. So, what do you think, Mister Tuvok. Are you up training a group of raw cadets?</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  You taught at the Academy for sixteen years. You'd be perfect for the job.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Commander Chakotay would be a more logical choice to be their instructor. He is a Maquis, as well as their former Captain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  That's my point. He doesn't have to earn their respect. We do.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Very well, Captain, I will prepare a curriculum.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Commander, pick out the Maquis crewmembers you feel would benefit most from the training. Have them report to Lt Tuvok at the next duty shift.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>TUVOK:  The answer to that question would seem to be self evident, crewman. Interrupting a senior officer is not acceptable behaviour. The purpose of this training is to familiarise you with Starfleet protocols so that mistakes like that will be minimised.</td></tr>
