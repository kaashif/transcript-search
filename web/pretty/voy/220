In the past twenty four hours, I've undergone rigorous diagnostic testing, submitted to an extensive psychological profile, and I've been poked and prodded in organs that I didn't even know I had. While all this testing may, no doubt, be necessary, frankly, I'm restless.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>TUVIX:  Remember, Captain, I do possess Tuvok's knowledge and expertise. And while I have no doubt that the crew misses Neelix's cooking, you need your most experienced tactical officer. That's me.</td></tr>

And since I've collected all the data I need, there's no reason I can't continue my investigation without him for the time being. And according to my tests, he's quite correct when he says that he possesses Tuvok's knowledge and expertise. He also possesses Tuvok's irritating sense of intellectual superiority and Neelix's annoying ebullience. I would be very grateful to you if you would assign him some duty, any duty somewhere else.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Well, Mister Tuvix, I'm not ready to assign you to the Bridge just yet, but why don't you join the senior staff for our noon briefing, and we'll see how it goes from there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>TUVIX:  Captain, has anyone ever told you that you are as fair-minded as you are lovely?</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  As a matter of fact, Neelix has told me that occasionally. And if you really do possess his memories, you'd know that flattery will get you nowhere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>KIM:  According to the transporter logs, they were optimal at the time of transport. It was a perfectly routine beam-out sequence. No anomalies, no power overloads, no malfunctions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>KES:  Commander Chakotay brought back a few samples on the shuttle and I ran a biochemical analysis. They contain the same elements as many plants. Chloroplasts, lysosomal enzymes, cytoplasmic proteins, but there's nothing unusual.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  There's never been an accident like this recorded in the entire history of transporter technology. I'm not willing to accept it as a random malfunction.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>TUVIX:  What I mean to say is, and I apologise for cutting you off, Commander, I think we're on the wrong track. Kes, you said that the flowers you examined contained lysosomal enzymes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>TUVIX:  According to Tuvok's botanical research, the presence of lysosomal enzymes could be evidence of symbiogenesis.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Symbiogenesis is a rare reproductive process. Instead of pollination or mating, symbiogenetic organisms merge with a second species.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>TUVIX:  Andorian amoeba for instance. They're able to merge with other single-celled organisms to form a third unique species, a hybrid.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  It's an interesting idea. But we're talking about microcellular organisms here. I've never heard of symbiogenesis occurring in a species as complex as a humanoid.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>TUVIX:  Actually Captain, when you think about it, Neelix and Tuvok were broken down to a microcellular level during transport. DNA, protein, all in a state of molecular flux.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>KIM:  And if the enzymes that cause symbiogenesis interacted with their DNA while they were in the matter stream, it might have caused their patterns to merge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Like an Andorian amoeba.</td></tr>

<tr id="L111"><td><a href="#L111">111</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  It's the best theory I've heard so far. It's the only theory I've heard so far, and it's worth investigating. Mister Paris, take a shuttle to the planet and collect additional flower specimens.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>PARIS:  Yes, ma'am, but I'd recommend waiting until morning. The weather on the planet can get pretty nasty at night.</td></tr>

The crew seems to be growing accustomed to his presence, and he's proving to be a very able tactical officer who isn't afraid to express his opinions. While he's forging relationships with many of the officers, he seems to be keeping a respectful distance from Kes, allowing her to adjust to the circumstances on her own terms. As for my relationship with Tuvix, I've found him to be an able advisor who skillfully uses humour to make his points. And although I feel a bit guilty saying it, his cooking is better than Neelix's.
