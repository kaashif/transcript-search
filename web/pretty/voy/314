<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>NAKAHN:  I landed my ship on the nearest of those twenty one moons. My navigator and I disembarked to start repairs. Damage was extensive. More than we'd anticipated. The hours past, the air grew cold, and with our weapons we started a fire to keep warm. Later, in the night, we awoke with a shudder. The ground was shaking. A moon quake. What could have been worse? We leapt into the ship, hoping the tremor would pass, but it was no tremor and it did not pass. For it was no moon we had landed on.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  What was it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>NAKAHN:  A creature. A living being so massive it generated it's own gravitational field. So immense it supported it's own ecosystem.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>KES:  Captain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>NAKAHN:  How long had it been lying there, dormant, slumbering, until wakened by our fire. Years? Centuries?</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>ZAHIR:  Perhaps even millennia?</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>NAKAHN:  Perhaps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>ZAHIR:  Returned. Curious, I was just visiting the system you spoke of only a few months ago. My ship's sensors picked up no such monster.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>NAKAHN:  Perhaps your sensors were faulty, or too busy gazing at your own reflection to bother looking out the window.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>ZAHIR:  Our guests are offering us supplies we need. In exchange we Travellers are giving them a look at what lies ahead of them. We should keep that view as clear as possible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>NAKAHN:  This is my Lodge. I say what I want. And you can go elsewhere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>ZAHIR:  I've journeyed to the corners of known space and beyond. I've earned the right to come and go as I please, where and when and how I please. Do you challenge that right?</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>ZAHIR:  Forgive my display, Captain, but my people consider outposts such as this to be necessary evils. Places to refuel, repair, exchange information and leave as quickly as possible. If I've observed anything working with Kes, it's her great tolerance. A quality you all seem to share. I regret not being able to demonstrate the same.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  There's no need to apologise for anything. Our time here has been very well spent, although I could use your help in sifting through that last colourful saga.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>EMH:  Thank you, Lord Byron. A classic romantic early nineteenth century argument.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Yes, it seems quite fascinating to see</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>GANDHI:  Classic or no, he is woefully misguided. Passion is meant for procreation. Anything further is contrary to divine intention.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>KES:  Maybe it's how they do it that's so impressive. Their ships are small, only a pilot and a navigator. Sometimes they just pick a direction and go. You should come down to the planet, Doctor. I want you to meet Zahir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>EMH:  Is he? In my opinion, you've become far to infatuated with these Travellers. From the away team reports they seem afflicted with terminal wanderlust. Risk taking thrill seekers with no responsibility to the ideals of exploration. In short, bad news.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>KES:  Not Zahir. He's more than that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>EMH:  I think I'm detecting a reaction to your recent break-up with Mister Neelix. The Mahatma would recommend a cold bath. Simplistic, but no doubt effective.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>EMH:  I've taken character traits from holodeck recreations of the most accomplished figures in history. Scientist, poets, philosophers, saints.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>TORRES:  Research is one thing, putting it into practice is something else. Behavioural subroutines have a way of interacting with each other which isn't always predictable. You've got to be careful, or someone might hurt you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>ZAHIR:  We have a saying. My course is as elusive as a shadow across the sky. My people are peripatetic by nature. We live for the excitement of facing the challenge of space, alone.</td></tr>
