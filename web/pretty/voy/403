<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>RAHMIN [on viewscreen]:  I'm deeply grateful. If it's not too much to ask, is there any way you might also spare a small quantity of thorium isotopes? Without them, our systems can't function.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I think we can arrange that. I'll speak to my engineer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Not at all. No, I make it a point to know these things. And if I'm correct, many Klingon families traditionally serve blood pie on the Day of Honour.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>TORRES:  I appreciate the gesture, Neelix, but I've decided to ignore this particular tradition. No blood pie, no examining my behaviour over the last year to see if I measure up to Klingon standards.</td></tr>
