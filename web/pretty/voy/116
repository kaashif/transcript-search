<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>TORRES:  Not any more. For the past few weeks we've been setting up holographic emitters on critical decks. We were hoping to set up a remote holo-projection system, give you access to other parts of the ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>TORRES:  Decks one through five. We also put them in Engineering, the Mess hall and the cargo bay. All the projectors are in place but the problem is we're going to have to interface with the Sickbay imaging system. That's going to take a lot of power and computer memory. I don't know if we have enough reserve power to spare.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>EMH:  Most of the crew is gone. Could we divert power from life support systems?</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>TORRES:  Good idea. I can drop life support down to minimum levels on the lower decks. That should give us enough power. All right, I'll need another twenty minutes to get the projectors online.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>TORRES:  There are a couple of things you should know. In order to do this I had to recalibrate your containment field, so your holo-matrix will be very sensitive to disruption. Try to stay away from energy discharges. Phaser fire, forcefields, that sort of thing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>EMH:  I'll try.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>TORRES:  I'm going to head down to engineering and try and get some of the critical systems working.
