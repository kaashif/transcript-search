LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     A standard Starfleet shuttlecraft is flying over a
     lush green forest.

  CHAKOTAY
     Beautiful, isnt it?

  SEVEN
     A sensor analysis would have provided the
     necessary information.

  CHAKOTAY
     Just admiring the view.

  SEVEN
     The conference begins in less than an hour.

  CHAKOTAY
     Theres always time for Warp Field Dynamics, but
     you dont see natural beauty like this every day.

  ANNOTATION
     Whumph

  CHAKOTAY
     What was that?

  SEVEN
     Some kind of energy barrier directly below us. It
     spans thousands of square kilometres.

  CHAKOTAY
     Why didnt our sensors detect it?

  SEVEN
     Uncertain. It has an unusual tetrion signature.
     Species three one two used a similar technology.
     Theres a power surge coming from the barrier.

  CHAKOTAY
     Shields at full.

  SEVEN
     Theyre creating some kind of feedback. Weve lost
     impulse engines.

  CHAKOTAY
     Go to warp.

  SEVEN
     The warp core is offline.

  CHAKOTAY
     Warp engines dont just shut down when you scrape
     an energy barrier.

  SEVEN
     Its affecting all our systems.

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Structural failure in thirty seconds.

  CHAKOTAY
     Well have to beam to the surface.

  SEVEN
     We cant transport through the barrier. Transfer
     auxiliary power to the weapons array.

  CHAKOTAY
     What are you trying to do?

  SEVEN
     If I can realign our phasers to the correct
     frequency, I may be able to open a rift.

  CHAKOTAY
     Big enough to get a shuttle through, I hope?

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Structural failure in ten seconds, nine,
     eight.

  SEVEN
     Phasers reconfigured.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay fires the phaser and flies the
     shuttlecraft through the resulting hole. They lose
     the nacelles as they go through, and beam out as
     the shuttlecraft tumbles to the ground.


LOCATION--Jungle

  SEVEN
     The barriers closed again.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay's leg has been cut. He can barely walk on
     it.

  SEVEN
     I should examine you.

  CHAKOTAY
     I dont think its serious.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits on a nearby log.

  SEVEN
     You have a hairline fracture.

  CHAKOTAY
     We've got bigger problems. Ill be fine.

  SEVEN
     Im detecting shuttle debris scattered over several
     square kilometres.

  CHAKOTAY
     Some of it might still be functional.

  SEVEN
     If we can find the right components, we may be
     able to construct a beacon. Send a distress
     signal.

  CHAKOTAY
     Through the barrier?

  SEVEN
     Maybe.

  CHAKOTAY
     If we hurry we might still make that conference.
     Well, if we have to be stranded somewhere, we
     couldnt ask for a nicer place.

  SEVEN
     We wouldnt be stranded at all if you hadnt
     insisted on admiring the view.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     Paris pilots the Flyer to an orbital platform.

  PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]
     Guest Vessel 74656, this is Ledos Port Control.
     Shut down your engines.

  PARIS
     This is Lieutenant Tom Paris. Is there a problem?

  PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]
     You were observed committing piloting violation
     two five six.

  PARIS
     I'm sorry, Im not familiar with your regulations.
     It wont happen again.

  PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]
     Youll be informed of the penalty.

  PARIS
     What kind of penalty?

  PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]
     Thats not my decision. Your docking permit says
     youre assigned to the starship Voyager?

  PARIS
     Thats right.

  PORT AUTHORITY OFFICER [on monitor]
     Your commanding officer will be notified of your
     infraction.


LOCATION--Ready Room

  PARIS
     Piloting lessons?

  JANEWAY
     Apparently, the standard penalty for your
     infraction is a three day course in flight safety,
     followed by a test.

  PARIS
     Well, did you explain we wouldnt be here that
     long?

  JANEWAY
     Actually, while you were completing your mission,
     Seven was invited to a four day conference.

  PARIS
     Here on Ledos?

  JANEWAY
     I decided to give the entire crew shore leave.
     It'll give you plenty of time to brush up on your
     piloting skills.

  PARIS
     I dont need lessons.

  JANEWAY
     Apparently the authorities disagree.

  PARIS
     But Captain

  JANEWAY
     You may not have known the Ledosians rules, but
     you know ours. Comply with local law. Understood?

  PARIS
     Yes, maam.


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     Seven finds a small piece of the shuttlecraft.

  SEVEN
     The relays are fused. Its useless.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay's tricorder has picked up something else.

  CHAKOTAY
     Looks like were not the only ones here.

  SEVEN
     Indigenous wildlife, perhaps.

  CHAKOTAY
     Im reading residual lifesigns. Theyre humanoid.

  SEVEN
     Ledosian?

  CHAKOTAY
     No. But they share the same genetic traits.
     Whoever they are, they may be able to help us.

  SEVEN
     Unless theyre hostile.

  CHAKOTAY
     Why dont we give them the benefit of the doubt.
     The lifesigns lead in that direction.

  SEVEN
     I suggest you rest your leg while I investigate.

  CHAKOTAY
     Its better is we stick together, at least until we
     know whether theyre hostile.


LOCATION--Above a clearing

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay leans on Seven's shoulder as they make
     their way up a slope to look down on a group of
     people. One seems to be making a stone tool. They
     are wearing minimal leather garments and strings
     of beads.

  CHAKOTAY
     Im guessing theyre pre-warp.

  SEVEN
     Obviously they cant help us.

  CHAKOTAY
     No, I dont suppose they can. But theyre
     fascinating, aren't they? I never expected to run
     into people like these on such a technologically
     advanced planet.

  SEVEN
     This isnt an anthropological mission, Commander.

  CHAKOTAY
     Youre right. We should keep searching for debris.
     Argh!

  ANNOTATION
     He collapses in pain.

  SEVEN
     Youre developing an infection. You should rest.

  CHAKOTAY
     Ill have to stay here and try to keep out of
     sight.

  SEVEN
     Ill contact you if I find anything useful.

  CHAKOTAY
     I guess I dont have to tell you to avoid
     interacting with these people.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay rests against a tree trunk.


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     Seven locates another small piece of the
     shuttlecraft. It is still working.

  SEVEN
     Seven of Nine to Chakotay.


LOCATION--Above a clearing

  SEVEN [OC]
     Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

  ANNOTATION
     A red hand is reaching for the comm. badge.
     Chakotay pushes it away and opens his eyes to see
     three natives in front of him.

  SEVEN [OC]
     Commander, respond. Ive found something. Seven of
     Nine to Chakotay.

  ANNOTATION
     One native snatches the comm. badge and smashes it
     with a stone. Seven puts the retrieved part in a
     case and walks on.


LOCATION--Cave - night

  ANNOTATION
     Seven sneaks past a group of natives gathered
     around a fire and tracks Chakotay's bio-signal to
     a cave. She finds Chakotay lying on a blanket,
     surrounded by natives.

  SEVEN
     Step away from him.

  ANNOTATION
     Her wrist beacon frightens them.

  CHAKOTAY
     Its all right, Seven. Theyre friendly. Theyre
     treating my wound.

  ANNOTATION
     His injured leg has been put in a splint. She
     turns off her beacon.

  SEVEN
     You said we were supposed to avoid interaction.

  CHAKOTAY
     They found me. There was nothing I could do.

  SEVEN
     You should have tried to contact me.

  CHAKOTAY
     I didnt want to expose them to our technology.

  SEVEN
     You hid your comm. badge?

  CHAKOTAY
     Actually, your call scared them. They broke it.

  SEVEN
     I suggest we leave before they break anything
     else.

  CHAKOTAY
     Look, theyre friendly, and I am hurt.

  SEVEN
     What are you suggesting?

  CHAKOTAY
     We may as well stay the night.

  SEVEN
     Commander.

  CHAKOTAY
     Its good shelter. And my leg feels better since
     they put this dressing on. Im going to get some
     rest. I suggest you do the same.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven sits near Chakotay. One young girl reaches
     out and touches her cortical implant.


LOCATION--Corridor

  KIM
     Chell says we shouldnt miss the Flame Gardens.

  NEELIX
     I hear the arboretum is beautiful, too.

  TORRES
     We can do both.

  KIM
     Tom. You joining us? Oh, thats right, you have to
     go to pilot school.

  TORRES
     I hear the course takes days.

  PARIS
     Yeah, for most people. But I did a little
     research. If the instructor agrees, you can skip
     the lessons and go right to the test. So I will be
     seeing you in a couple of hours.

  NEELIX
     You have to admire his optimism.


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  TRANSPORTER OPERATOR
     Just a moment, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     An elderly man is beamed aboard.

  KLEG
     I am Mister Kleg, the flying instructor. Are you
     Lieutenant Paris?

  KIM
     He is.

  PARIS
     Its an honour to meet you, sir. May I show you to
     the Delta Flyer?

  KLEG
     Why?

  PARIS
     So you can explain what I did wrong, and then
     administer the test.

  KLEG
     It sounds to me like you need lessons in patience
     as well.

  TORRES
     Oh, Tom is very patient, sir.

  NEELIX
     Never impulsive.

  KIM
     Take all the time you need. Hell enjoy the extra
     attention.

  KLEG
     Well, Im please to hear it. Well start with a
     review of safety procedures. Do you have a visual
     display system I can access?

  PARIS
     I think I can find one.

  TORRES
     Have fun.

  KIM
     Energise.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim, Neelix and Torres are beamed away.

  PARIS
     So how long will this review take?

  KLEG
     Oh, typically about four hours. But there's no
     rush.

  PARIS
     Of course not.


LOCATION--Clearing - day

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay is drawing a map in the dust for a local
     man. The young girl comes to watch, too.

  CHAKOTAY
     River.

  ANNOTATION
     The man looks blank, so he pours water onto the
     wavy line.

  CHAKOTAY
     River.

  ANNOTATION
     The man holds one arm horizontal across his body
     and the other underneath with the fingers moving.
     Chakotay copies him, then puts a stone next to the
     line on the ground.

  CHAKOTAY
     Mountain.

  ANNOTATION
     He points to it behind them.

  CHAKOTAY
     Mountain.

  ANNOTATION
     The man makes a fist rising upwards. Chakotay adds
     gestures to his own words.

  CHAKOTAY
     Where are we?

  ANNOTATION
     The man points to the place on the ground, then
     touches Chakotay's rank insignia.

  CHAKOTAY
     This?

  ANNOTATION
     The man takes a small item from his pouch, then
     gestures to Chakotay and himself and holds his
     palm out flat.

  CHAKOTAY
     You want to trade? Well, I suppose it won't hurt.

  ANNOTATION
     They trade items. The man gathers air into his
     hand and brings it to his heart.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'll take that as a thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven returns.

  SEVEN
     Did you make a favourable exchange?

  CHAKOTAY
     I didn't want to insult their customs. Any luck?

  SEVEN
     I may have found a way of communicating.

  CHAKOTAY
     Me too. I've learned to say thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     He demonstrates. The girl is watching Seven.

  SEVEN
     I was referring to communication with Voyager. It
     may be possible to construct a beacon by
     connecting these components to the shuttle's
     deflector.

  CHAKOTAY
     Did you find it?

  SEVEN
     I detected it six kilometres from here. I believe
     it's intact.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm not sure I'm up to that long a trip.

  SEVEN
     I'll go.

  CHAKOTAY
     I've started mapping the area. Here's the river we
     passed. This is where we beamed down. And we're
     here now.

  SEVEN
     Then the deflector should be approximately here.

  CHAKOTAY
     Six kilometres is a long way. Maybe one of them
     could guide you.

  SEVEN
     I'm still trying to limit our contact with these
     people.

  CHAKOTAY
     The sooner you get to the deflector, the sooner we
     can get out of here. They know the terrain. Maybe
     they can get you there faster.

  SEVEN
     And watch me construct a tetrion-based signalling
     device.

  CHAKOTAY
     All right, but be careful. Seven. This is how they
     say goodbye.

  ANNOTATION
     A fist over the heart, then the arm extends out
     with an open downward palm. Seven leaves. She
     manages to trip over a tree root and lose her
     tricorder down a hole in the ground. As she cannot
     reach it, she moves on. Back at the clearing, the
     man makes Chakotay a stout walking stick.

  CHAKOTAY
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     He hobbles over to a group of teenagers, and
     gestures fist over heart opening all fingers palm
     outwards.

  CHAKOTAY
     Hello.

  ANNOTATION
     Then he sees that they are painting copies of his
     tattoo on each other.


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     It's dark, and a storm is brewing. Seven stumbles
     over a log and finds that she is walking in
     circles. Her hair is coming loose from its pleat.
     She sits down and hugs herself. There is a
     rustling nearby.

  SEVEN
     Identify yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     The girl comes and puts a blanket over Seven's
     shoulders, then scrapes a couple of stones
     together before squeezing the oils from nearby
     fruits on them to make a fire.

  SEVEN
     An exothermic reaction.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven turns off her wrist beacon as the fire
     brightens. She is offered part of a stick of dried
     food.

  SEVEN
     I'm not hungry.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     In the shuttlebay, an impartial eye is not
     impressed with the craft's design.

  KLEG
     Inadequate system integration. Visibility impaired
     by lateral sensor array. Insufficient console
     accessibility.

  PARIS
     You know, I couldn't agree more. Those are some of
     the defects that led to my so-called pilot error.

  KLEG
     Polarity thrusters? Oh, they've been known to
     cause accidental acceleration.

  PARIS
     Exactly my point. Why should I be held responsible
     for the ship's design flaws?

  KLEG
     According to the maintenance records, you were
     this vessel's chief designer. I make it a point of
     professional pride to research every case I'm
     assigned to. Are you familiar with that term,
     Lieutenant? Professional pride?

  PARIS
     Yes, sir. In fact, that is why I'm so eager to get
     underway. I want to prove to you that I'm a good
     pilot.

  KLEG
     There are protocols, Mister Paris. System by
     system diagnostics, pre-flight simulations.

  PARIS
     You must have other students who need your
     attention. It wouldn't be fair to

  KLEG
     Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'm planning to spend as
     much time with you as you need.


LOCATION--Jungle - day

  ANNOTATION
     Seven wakes. The sky is clear and the birds are
     singing. The girl makes an open palms rising
     upwards gesture.

  SEVEN
     Good morning.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven makes a half-hearted response to the
     gesture. The girl offers food again, and this time
     it is accepted. Seven draws a map in the dirt

  SEVEN
     Im trying to go here.

  ANNOTATION
     The girl points.

  SEVEN
     Can you show me?

  ANNOTATION
     The girl leads the way. They stop by some bright
     plants.

  SEVEN
     Yes. I thought it was this way.

  ANNOTATION
     But the girl shows her a triple waterfall instead.

  SEVEN
     Yes, its quite an impressive view. Now we really
     have to

  ANNOTATION
     But the girl sits to look for a while, so Seven
     joins her.


LOCATION--Clearing

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay goes to the man and touches his head and
     the back of his hand, indicating Seven's implants.

  CHAKOTAY
     My friend, she hasnt come back. I need to find
     her.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay draws in the dirt.

  CHAKOTAY
     She looks like this. Where?

  ANNOTATION
     The man gestures stay her, then brings a young
     woman to him, with a small piece of shuttle
     circuitry tied over her left eye

  CHAKOTAY
     Where'd you get this?

  ANNOTATION
     They show him a bag full of metal bits.

  CHAKOTAY
     My friend. Where?


LOCATION--Debris field

  ANNOTATION
     The nosecone of the shuttlecraft is stuck in the
     ground. The girl goes to touch a sharp edge.

  SEVEN
     Dont touch that! Please.

  ANNOTATION
     Her tone of voice is enough. The girl moves away
     as Seven works.


LOCATION--Astrometrics

  JANEWAY
     Problem?

  TUVOK
     Commander Chakotay failed to report in at the
     scheduled time. We tried hailing, but there was no
     response.

  KIM
     We contacted the conference coordinator. He said
     Seven and Chakotay never showed up.

  JANEWAY
     Anything on sensors?

  KIM
     We've located a hull signature over the southern
     subcontinent, but its only a wing.

  JANEWAY
     Nothing else? No lifesigns?

  KIM
     No, maam.

  JANEWAY
     Thats awfully low for something to be in orbit.

  TUVOK
     Its not in orbit. Its resting on an energy
     barrier.

  KIM
     We think the shuttle may have collided with it.

  JANEWAY
     Why didnt they see it?

  TUVOK
     Standard scans didnt reveal its presence. We were
     only able to detect it with our Borg sensors.

  JANEWAY
     If all you found was a wing, maybe the rest of the
     shuttle made it through the barrier.

  TUVOK
     Logic suggests that possibility. Unfortunately,
     the barrier's deflecting all our scans. Theres no
     way to know if the shuttle or its occupants are on
     the other side.

  JANEWAY
     Hail the Ledosian ambassador.


LOCATION--Bridge

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     Wed have warned your Commander, but his flight
     plan didnt go anywhere near that area.

  JANEWAY
     He must have altered his route for some reason.

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     And collided with the barrier. Im sorry.

  JANEWAY
     Were not assuming theyre dead.

  TUVOK
     We believe they may have found a way through.

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     Thats very unlikely.

  JANEWAY
     Theyre resourceful people. Can you tell us
     anything about the barrier?

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     It shields the territory of an indigenous society,
     the Ventu.

  JANEWAY
     Then the areas habitable. If you lowered the
     barrier, we could scan for our peoples lifesigns.

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     Im afraid we cant do that.

  JANEWAY
     Why not?

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     It was erected by aliens hundreds of years ago.
     They havent been back. The technology is a mystery
     to us.

  TUVOK
     Why did these aliens build the barrier?

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     To protect the Ventu.

  JANEWAY
     From whom?

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     Us. Our ancestors fought them, polluted their
     habitat. Im afraid we werent very enlightened back
     then.

  JANEWAY
     Earth went through its dark periods too,
     Ambassador. Would you have any objections if we
     tried to lower the barrier, just to scan for our
     people?

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     I told you, its not possible.

  TUVOK
     Perhaps if you gave us information about the
     barriers power source?

  AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]
     The generator is inside. Theres no way to access
     it. Even if your people did survive, Im afraid
     theres no way to get them out.

  SOMEONE
     Captains log, stardate 54827.7. Although the
     Ledosians are sceptical, theyre allowing us to try
     to locate our people. Meanwhile, we've begun to
     analyse the shuttle fragment.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     The burn patterns suggest a tetrion flux.

  TUVOK
     We found a reference to similar technology in
     Sevens Borg database.

  JANEWAY
     You think the Borg erected it?

  TUVOK
     No, but it may have been constructed by people
     they later assimilated. Species three one two.

  JANEWAY
     If Seven were here, she might be able to figure
     out a way to get through it.

  TORRES
     Maybe she already did. Some of the damage to the
     wing was caused by feedback from the shuttles
     phasers.

  JANEWAY
     Seven and Chakotay might have used them to
     penetrate the barrier for some reason.

  TUVOK
     If I can determine the appropriate frequency, I
     may be able to do the same thing. But there is
     risk involved.

  JANEWAY
     What sort of risk?

  TORRES
     It looks like the feedback from the barrier is
     what destroyed the shuttle. If were not careful
     the same thing could happen to Voyager.


LOCATION--Debris field

  ANNOTATION
     The girl is making bracelets from pieces of
     magnetic rock. Seven activates her communication
     device, but the energy arcs to a nearby group of
     pebbles and fails.

  SEVEN
     May I see those?

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay arrives with the man.

  CHAKOTAY
     Seven, is everything all right?

  SEVEN
     I need your tricorder.

  CHAKOTAY
     Nice to see you, too.

  SEVEN
     I lost mine. Theres a strong magnetic field here
     thats preventing me from generating a deflector
     beam. But the field drops off approximately four
     point eight kilometres in that direction.

  CHAKOTAY
     Can you transmit the signal from there?

  SEVEN
     Not through the barrier, but I may be able to
     neutralise it by generating a dampening field with
     our deflector.

  CHAKOTAY
     Even if youre right, this must weight five hundred
     kilos. How would we move it?

  SEVEN
     Some of them could help us.

  CHAKOTAY
     We shouldnt involve them.

  SEVEN
     Do I detect a change in attitude, Commander?

  CHAKOTAY
     Your concern was justified. Theyve been gathering
     debris from the shuttle, using it to imitate us. I
     dont want them helping.

  SEVEN
     Whats the alternative? Staying here? Allowing them
     to find all of the debris? If we neutralise the
     barrier, Voyager can transport us and our
     technology off the surface.

  CHAKOTAY
     Is there a possibility that this dampening field
     could disrupt the barrier permanently?

  SEVEN
     Unlikely. Once the deflector is deactivated the
     barrier should reinitialise.

  CHAKOTAY
     Lets hope youre right.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer is negotiating a test course marked with
     beacons.

  KLEG
     So you can execute a turn at less than three
     hundred kph. Well done, Lieutenant.

  PARIS
     Thanks. You know, I dont want to seem impatient
     again, but is there any way youd let me take that
     test now?

  KLEG
     I thought Id made myself clear about that. All my
     students complete the entire course.

  PARIS
     I understand, sir, but two of my friends are
     missing, and Id like to help find them.

  KLEG
     Well, thats an admirable sentiment. But if I give
     you special treatment it wouldnt be fair to the
     others who have to take this course. Besides, why
     stop now? Youre getting very close to becoming an
     adequate pilot.


LOCATION--Rocky Rise

  ANNOTATION
     The Ventu are helping drag the nose cone, which
     presumably contains the shuttle's deflector, up a
     slope.

  SEVEN
     Here, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     The natives put down their ropes and stand aside.

  SEVEN
     Not so close.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager tries to phaser the barrier. They get
     feedback along the energy line.

  KIM
     Phasers are starting to overload.

  JANEWAY
     Can we divert any more power to the shields?

  TUVOK
     The shields are amplifying the feedback.

  TORRES
     The barrier's interfering with every system we
     activate.

  JANEWAY
     Cease fire. Im open to suggestions.

  TUVOK
     We may be able to reconfigure a photon torpedo to
     detonate at the appropriate frequency.

  JANEWAY
     What about feedback?

  TUVOK
     A torpedo shouldnt create any. Theoretically.

  JANEWAY
     Do it.


LOCATION--Rocky Rise

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay and Seven set up the communicator. The
     natives lean in to watch.

  SEVEN
     Theyre too close.

  CHAKOTAY
     Back, behind the rise. Stay back.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven starts up the deflector and moves away, as
     the girl sneaks around for a closer look.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     The energy barriers coming down.

  JANEWAY
     I thought you were still reconfiguring the
     torpedo.

  TUVOK
     I am. Its being deactivated from the inside.

  JANEWAY
     Harry, scan for lifesigns.

  KIM
     Aye, Captain.


LOCATION--Rocky Rise

  ANNOTATION
     The girl comes forward to touch the shuttle debris
     whilst wearing one of the magnetic stone
     bracelets.

  SEVEN
     Take it off!

  ANNOTATION
     The girl gets zapped.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     Im only reading one comm. badge. Its Sevens.

  JANEWAY
     Open a channel. Janeway to Seven.


LOCATION--Rocky Rise

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Are you and Chakotay all right?

  SEVEN
     Yes, Captain.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Stand by for transport.

  SEVEN
     Lock on to Commander Chakotay. I need more time.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Is there a problem?

  SEVEN
     Someones been injured. She requires medical
     attention.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Do you need the Doctor?

  SEVEN
     I believe I can treat her. A medkit would be
     useful.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, supplemental. Seven has remained on
     the surface to tend to the injured Ventu girl,
     while Chakotay is being treated in Sickbay.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     The poultice healed the fracture and the
     infection. Im impressed.

  CHAKOTAY
     Theyre impressive people. I just hope we havent
     traumatised them.

  JANEWAY
     You did what you had to do to get out of there.

  CHAKOTAY
     Still, I think we transport all the shuttle debris
     back to Voyager as soon as possible.

  JANEWAY
     Agreed.


LOCATION--Cave

  ANNOTATION
     The girl wakes up.

  SEVEN
     Would you like some breakfast? Im not hungry
     either.

  ANNOTATION
     The girl touches the metal on Seven's hand.

  SEVEN
     I admire your curiosity, but you should be more
     careful. Its time for me to leave.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven gestures goodbye, the girl replies where?

  SEVEN
     Back to my home.

  ANNOTATION
     The girl offers her the blanket.

  SEVEN
     Thats very kind, but I have no use for it. I
     supposed I should respect your customs. Thank you.

  BARUS [OC]
     These botanical specimens indicate a high level of
     serum nitrates.


LOCATION--Clearing

  BARUS
     Catalogue those foliates.

  SEVEN
     Explain your presence here.

  BARUS
     Oh. You must be from Voyager.

  SEVEN
     Who are you?
