Flesh and Blood
TEASER

LOCATION--Woodland

  ANNOTATION
     Two Hirogen with honking big guns are hiding
     behind a tree trunk One is an older male, one
     young. Father and son perhaps?.

  HIROGEN 1
     How many are there?

  HIROGEN 2
     They've deflected our scans.

  HIROGEN 1
     You must learn to rely on instinct. There are four
     of them, Perhaps five.

  ANNOTATION
     They move on slowly. Something runs across the
     path behind them and the young hunter fires his
     gun, missing.

  HIROGEN 1
     No! You'll lead them right to us.

  HIROGEN 2
     Let them come.

  HIROGEN 1
     Never let your prey control the hunt. There. Ten
     metres.

  ANNOTATION
     Then another noise.

  HIROGEN 2
     They're behind us now.

  ANNOTATION
     They continue down to a small lake. The water is
     calm and reflective. Repeated weapons fire comes
     out of the water, hitting the Hirogen and killing
     them. Then four figures emerge from below the
     surface - in Starfleet uniforms.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  CHAKOTAY
     You wanted to see me?

  EMH
     I'd like to request a temporary leave of absence.
     You remember the Ovions?

  CHAKOTAY
     The hexapods.

  EMH
     They just asked me to speak at a Symposium on
     spaceborne pathogens. There are going to be
     physicians from all over the Quadrant. This is a
     rare opportunity for me. And for the rest of the
     crew.

  CHAKOTAY
     How's that?

  EMH
     I'd be representing Voyager. Putting our best foot
     forward, so to speak. And, needless to say
     hexapods are more likely to know a best foot when
     they see one.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm sorry, Doctor. It's just not practical.

  EMH
     I seem to recall Lieutenant Torres participating
     in Boray Conference on transwarp theory a few
     months back.

  CHAKOTAY
     That was different.

  EMH
     How?

  CHAKOTAY
     We were there. The Ovion system is two weeks
     behind us. I can't ask the captain to turn the
     ship around.

  EMH
     I could take a shuttle.

  CHAKOTAY
     You could also write a paper and submit it on
     subspace.

  EMH
     That's hardly an effective means of making a
     presentation.

  CHAKOTAY
     Say you do take a shuttle. Would you expect us to
     sit here and wait for you to get back?

  EMH
     There must be some fascinating anomaly nearby for
     the crew to explore.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Janeway to Chakotay.

  CHAKOTAY
     Go ahead.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     We just received a distress call on an Hirogen
     frequency.

  CHAKOTAY
     We haven't heard from them in a while.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     I've altered course. I'd like you on the bridge.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm on my way.

  EMH
     Perhaps the Hirogen will keep you occupied long
     enough for me to attend the Symposium.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay leaves.

  EMH
     You can't blame a hologram for trying.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     Approaching the coordinates.

  JANEWAY
     Take us out of warp. Raise shields and stand by
     weapons.

  KIM
     I've got them. Six thousand kilometres off
     starboard.

  JANEWAY
     On screen.

  ANNOTATION
     It looks like a space station.

  CHAKOTAY
     Monotanium hull plating. Tylium based power. It's
     Hirogen.

  KIM
     They're not responding to hails.

  CHAKOTAY
     Life signs?

  KIM
     I'm getting a lot of strange readings. Any one of
     them could be a life form.

  JANEWAY
     Any Hirogen ships in the vicinity?

  PARIS
     No, ma'am.

  CHAKOTAY
     It might be a trap.

  JANEWAY
     The Hirogen aren't the type to play possum. Move
     us within transporter range. Chakotay, take an
     away team.


LOCATION--Forest

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay, Paris, Seven, Tuvok and a security guard
     beam down.

  CHAKOTAY
     Let's break into teams. Seven.

  ANNOTATION
     She and Chakotay go one way, the remaining three
     the other. Tuvok finds an Hirogen corpse hidden
     under a pile of leaves.

  PARIS
     Particle weapons.

  TUVOK
     These burns are consistent with a type-three
     phaser.

  ANNOTATION
     Down by the lake, Seven finds a weapon wedged in a
     tree. It has blood on it.

  SEVEN
     Commander.

  CHAKOTAY
     A bat'leth.

  SEVEN
     What's a Klingon weapon doing in the Delta
     Quadrant?

  CHAKOTAY
     The blood's Hirogen. Chakotay to Tuvok and Paris.

  PARIS [OC]
     Go ahead.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm reading an Hirogen lifesign. It could be
     wounded.

  PARIS [OC]
     We're right behind you.

  ANNOTATION
     Weapons fire hits a nearby rock.

  DONIK
     Stay away!

  CHAKOTAY
     Hold your fire!

  ANNOTATION
     He doesn't. Chakotay signals Tuvok and Paris to go
     around.

  CHAKOTAY
     We're here to help you.

  DONIK
     I said stay away!

  ANNOTATION
     The weapons fire is making so much noise that the
     Hunter does not hear Tuvok sneak up behind. He
     neck-pinches him.

  PARIS
     He's lost a lot of blood. I need to get him back
     to the ship. Paris to Sickbay, two to beam up.

  EMH
     Acknowledged.

  SEVEN
     Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven uncovers a console.

  TUVOK
     Replicated Starfleet technology.

  SEVEN
     It's some kind of holodeck interface.

  TUVOK
     There appear to be holo-emitters installed
     throughout the facility.

  SEVEN
     This environment is simulated.

  CHAKOTAY
     Why didn't our tricorders detect it?

  TUVOK
     I am not certain.

  CHAKOTAY
     Can you shut down the emitters?

  SEVEN
     I'll try.

  ANNOTATION
     She succeeds. The holodeck floor is littered with
     Hirogen corpses.


LOCATION--Corridor

  CHAKOTAY
     Evidently, they made a few modifications. All of
     our preliminary scans indicated the environment
     was real.

  JANEWAY
     Environments that fool sensors. No safety
     protocols. How many bodies?

  SOMEONE
     CHAKOTAY Forty-three. Most of them were killed by
     facsimiles of Alpha quadrant weapons. Romulan
     disrupters, Klingon bat'leths.

  JANEWAY
     Starfleet phasers?

  CHAKOTAY
     I think we'll find they all came from the
     holotechnology we gave the Hirogen three years
     ago.

  JANEWAY
     They obviously missed the point. We gave them that
     technology so they could hunt holographic prey,
     not get themselves killed.


LOCATION--Sickbay
