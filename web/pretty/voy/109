Prime Factors
TEASER

LOCATION--Mess Hall

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is openly eyeing a man who has just
     collected a meal from the counter. She turns back
     to see Seska looking at her.

  TORRES
     What?

  SESKA
     I've seen that look before. Ensign Murphy had
     better watch out.

  TORRES
     I happen to know that Murphy is seeing one of the
     Delaney sisters.

  SESKA
     Not since Harry and Tom Paris made their move.

  TORRES
     Harry and the Delaney sisters? He would have told
     me.

  SESKA
     I guess there are some things he keeps to himself.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris and Kim are at the next table.

  TORRES
     Harry, is it true about you and the Delaney
     sisters?

  KIM
     Is what true?

  SESKA
     Come on Harry, there aren't any secrets on a ship
     this small.

  KIM
     What have you been telling people?

  PARIS
     Well, we did take that trip to Venice with them.

  KIM
     The holodeck? You've got to be kidding. That
     lasted all of fifteen minutes.

  PARIS
     Yeah, you know, I've been meaning to ask you. What
     happened when you and Jenny Delaney disappeared in
     that gondola?

  KIM
     Nothing.

  TORRES
     Harry, we're your friends. You can tell us.

  KIM
     Nothing. We talked, and then I fell over the side.

  SESKA
     You fell out of the gondola?

  PARIS
     I think maybe Harry wasn't quite prepared for how
     voracious Jenny Delaney can be.

  ANNOTATION
     And at another table.

  JANEWAY
     I think it's finally beginning to happen. Both
     crews getting along.

  TUVOK
     That kind of bonding should improve performance
     and maximise efficiency.

  JANEWAY
     Yes, I'm sure it will.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Janeway.

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Captain, we're receiving a distress call in one of
     the lower subspace bands.

  JANEWAY
     I'm on my way.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway, Paris and Kim enter.

  JANEWAY
     Report, Commander.

  CHAKOTAY
     The subspace distress signal is coming from a
     vessel bearing one two five mark two one. Distance
     two hundred thousand kilometres.

  KIM
     Captain, sensors indicate five lifeforms aboard.

  TUVOK
     The vessel is altering it's course to intercept
     us.

  JANEWAY
     Go to yellow alert and slow to impulse. Hail them,
     Mister Kim.

  KIM
     Aye, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     The image of a human looking man comes on the
     viewscreen.

  JANEWAY
     This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation
     Starship Voyager. What is the nature of your
     emergency?

  GATH [on viewscreen]
     We have no emergency.

  JANEWAY
     But you're sending out a distress call.

  GATH [on viewscreen]
     Yes, we are.

  JANEWAY
     Why?

  GATH [on viewscreen]
     Because you are in distress. I am Gathhorel Labin
     of the planet Sikaris. Please, let us welcome you
     to our system. Show you the hospitality of our
     people.

  JANEWAY
     that's very kind of you

  GATH [on viewscreen]
     If I could come aboard your ship, I have gifts for
     you and a proposal I hope you will find
     irresistible.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Tuvok, make the necessary arrangements to
     receive our guest.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix and Kes are working in the kitchen when
     Janeway and Gath enter. Tuvok follows.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Labin, it really isn't necessary to go to
     all this trouble.

  GATH
     Please. Call me Gath. And I promise you I would
     like nothing better than to prepare a few of our
     newest delicacies for you. Ah, this will be
     perfect.

  NEELIX
     Captain, I'm serving lunch in less that two hours.

  JANEWAY
     We won't be long, Neelix. This is Mister, this is
     Gath. He's from Sikaris.

  ANNOTATION
     Gath takes dishes from a bag he was carrying.

  NEELIX
     Ah! Ooo. Sikaris!

  JANEWAY
     Do you know the planet?

  NEELIX
     Only stories about their incredible hospitality.

  JANEWAY
     Tell me, how do you know about us?

  GATH
     Our people are very well travelled. Some of them
     have brought back stories about the ship of aliens
     from another part of the galaxy. People lost and
     alone, struggling to find their way home again.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway, Neelix and Kes sample Gath's food.

  JANEWAY
     This is wonderful.

  GATH
     And I decided to come and meet you and offer you
     respite.

  TUVOK
     Respite?

  GATH
     A vacation, if you will. Get away from the
     confines of the ship, enjoy the beauty of our
     landscape, meet and talk with interesting, learned
     people.

  KES
     And the crew would certainly welcome a little
     shore leave, Captain.

  NEELIX
     And I hear the Sikarians have a huge variety of
     edible plants. If we could collect some seeds,
     we'd expand our selection significantly.

  JANEWAY
     Sounds like all this would increase performance
     and maximise efficiency, don't you think, Mister
     Tuvok?

  TUVOK
     Indeed.

  JANEWAY
     Well Gath, looks like you're getting visitors.
     We'll set a course and follow you in.

  GATH
     I could not be happier.


LOCATION--Plaza

  ANNOTATION
     Open, light, lots of steps and patterned tiled
     floor. There are some small stalls. Birds are
     singing.

  GATH
     If you see anything you like, just let me know.

  JANEWAY
     What is this material? It's so delicate.

  GATH
     Exquisite, isn't it? It's the latest import from
     Vedestris. It's spun from the petals of a flower
     that blooms only in moonlight. Shall I have a
     dress made for you?

  JANEWAY
     It's lovely but, no, thank you.

  GATH
     Is it so hard for you to accept a gift?

  JANEWAY
     All right, but something small. Maybe a scarf?

  GATH
     What a curious people you are. Tell me would it
     help if I said that you could have an entire
     wardrobe made from these beautiful fabrics and
     that it would give all of us great pleasure to
     create it for you.

  JANEWAY
     Let's start with the scarf.

  GATH
     As you like. Which cloth do you prefer?

  ANNOTATION
     Elsewhere, Kim has found a young woman waving a
     device over what looks like a minimalist harp. It
     makes harmonic tones.

  KIM
     That's beautiful. Are you a musician?

  EUDANA
     This isn't a musical instrument. It's an
     atmospheric sensor. The frequency of the chimes
     indicates changes in weather conditions.

  KIM
     Then it must work on a principle of non-linear
     resonance, adjusting to the dynamic variables in
     the atmosphere.

  EUDANA
     That's exactly right. Are you a scientist?

  KIM
     In a sense. Can you show me how to operate it?

  EUDANA
     I'd be happy to. First, you have to initialise the
     sub-harmonic mode.

  ANNOTATION
     She switches on the hand device and Kim moves it
     around the struts and wires of the weather
     station. Janeway selects a blue patterned fabric.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, I think this one.

  GATH
     When I see you wearing that scarf, my pleasure
     will be greater than yours.

  JANEWAY
     Well, I should get back. But with your permission,
     I'd like to start organising teams to gather
     plants and seeds.

  GATH
     This is my associate, Jaret Otel. You may contact
     him to make any necessary arrangements.

  JARET
     We'll be glad to assist you in any way, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     I'll find my officers and we'll return to the
     ship.

  GATH
     Tonight we are having a celebration here. I hope
     you and your officers will be my guests.

  JANEWAY
     We'd be delighted.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, stardate 48642.5. The crew is
     enjoying an evening on Sikaris. They are
     discovering, to their delight, that reports of
     this species' hospitality have not been
     exaggerated.


LOCATION--Plaza

  ANNOTATION
     Kim is in casual clothes, reclining on cushions
     and telling the story.

  KIM
     So the whole thing exploded and there we were,
     seventy thousand light years from home and no way
     to get back. It felt pretty lonely.

  EUDANA
     That's a very noble story.

  KIM
     Noble?

  EUDANA
     Stories can be whimsical, or frightening, or
     melancholy, or many other things. But noble
     stories are the ones that can most affect our
     lives. May I have your permission to tell others
     this story?

  KIM
     Sure. It's no secret.
