<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  All right, let's stake a claim. I'll leave this in your hands, B'Elanna. Use whatever resources or personnel you need. You might want to talk to Mister Neelix. I believe he spent some time working in a mining colony.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>TORRES:  These tunnels are clearly artificial. Someone else must've been interested in digging up this gallicite.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>VORIK:  That should make it easier to access the deposits.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>TORRES:  True, but we have to be careful. There's been a lot of seismic activity down there. Look, theses tunnels are completely collapsed. We should bring Tom Paris on the away team. He's had quite a lot of rock climbing experience.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>VORIK:  I have spent several summers exploring the Osana caverns, which involved some quite treacherous climbing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>TORRES:  Great. You two can be our safety experts.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>VORIK:  Let me take this opportunity to declare koon-ut so'lik, my desire to become your mate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>TORRES:  What?</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>VORIK:  In human terms, I am proposing marriage. Do you accept?</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>TORRES:  This is, er, a little sudden, isn't it? Besides, I thought that Vulcan marriages were arranged. Don't you already have somebody back home?</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>VORIK:  She has sufficient reason to consider me lost, and has most likely chosen another mate. It's appropriate for me to do the same.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>TORRES:  And you've chosen me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>VORIK:  I have come to greatly admire not only your impressive technical skills, but also your bravery and sense of moral duty. All excellent qualities in a prospective mate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>TORRES:  But you're Vulcan. I am half-Klingon. I really can't imagine</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>VORIK:  Perhaps we are not an obvious match. However, our differences would complement each other. You've often expressed frustration with your Klingon temper. My mental discipline would help you control it. Furthermore, I feel that</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>TORRES:  Wait, please. Please, I'm. I see that you've given this a lot of, er, logical thought and I really am very flattered, but my answer is no. I'm sorry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>VORIK:  B'Elanna, you may wish to reconsider. Your choices for a mate are currently limited to seventy three male crew members on this ship, some of whom are already unavailable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>TORRES:  I'll worry about my choices myself, thank you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>VORIK:  I should also remind you that many humanoid species are unable to withstand Klingon mating practices</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>TORRES:  Okay, that's enough.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>VORIK:  whereas my superior Vulcan strength would make me a very suitable partner.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vorik grabs Torres' face with both hands. She manages to break his hold and knocks him down.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>KES:  Here are the results of his cortical scan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>TORRES:  So what's wrong with him?</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>EMH:  In addition to a dislocated jaw, Ensign Vorik seems to be suffering from a neurochemical imbalance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>TORRES:  Meaning what?</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>EMH:  I believe I should discuss that with the patient privately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Torres leaves.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>EMH:  You're going through the Pon farr, aren't you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>VORIK:  That's an extremely personal question, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>EMH:  Yes, I'm aware that Vulcans prefer to keep their mating practices very much to themselves. There's almost nothing in the medical database beyond a few observations made by Starfleet doctors over the years. Your symptoms, the chemical imbalance and loss of emotional control, are consistent with those observations. Have you been eating and sleeping normally?</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>VORIK:  I knew there was something wrong. I was hoping it wasn't this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>EMH:  I assume this is your first Pon farr? There's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's a normal biological function. I'll do what I can to help you through it, but I'll need a little more information.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>VORIK:  We do not discuss it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>EMH:  I'm afraid you'll have to. You have a severe imbalance in your brain chemistry. If it gets much worse, it could become life threatening. Now I need to know how Vulcans deal with this condition.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>VORIK:  We go home. Every seven years of our adult life, Vulcans experience an instinctual, irresistible urge to return to the homeworld and take a mate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>EMH:  But in your case, being stranded halfway across the galaxy, that's impossible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>VORIK:  Yes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>EMH:  So then logically, you try to find a mate here. I assume that explains your behaviour toward Lieutenant Torres.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>VORIK:  I have always had great respect for B'Elanna. I hope she isn't too upset with me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>EMH:  With Lieutenant Torres, upset is a relative term. In any case, we're going to have to try to find another way to treat your condition. Let's start with a microcellular scan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>VORIK:  No! I don't want medical treatment. I will resolve this myself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>EMH:  How do you intend to do that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>VORIK:  There are certain meditative techniques. I will be fine if simply left alone. Please, allow me to return to my quarters. Confine me there, if you wish, but allow me to resolve my situation privately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>EMH:  Until I have a better idea of how to treat your condition, I'll release you to your quarters. You'll be under confinement and wearing a cortical monitor at all times.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>VORIK:  Thank you.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Doctor's office</td></tr>
<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Later, the EMH consults with the resident expert on all things Vulcan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>EMH:  I'm concerned about Ensign Vorik's cortical readings. One returns to normal levels, then another one spikes. It's chaotic. As if the brain's regulatory system had simply shut down. I can't tell if he's making any progress with these meditations. I thought maybe you could suggest other possible treatments.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I cannot.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>EMH:  Is that because you don't know, or because you don't want to discuss it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>TUVOK:  For both of those reasons there is little help that I can offer. It is inappropriate for me to involve myself in Ensign Vorik's personal situation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>EMH:  For such an intellectually enlightened race, Vulcans have a remarkably Victorian attitude about sex.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>TUVOK:  That is a very human judgement, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>EMH:  Then here's a Vulcan one. I fail to see the logic in perpetuating ignorance about a basic biological function.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>TUVOK:  There is nothing logical about the Pon farr. It is a time when instinct and emotion dominate over reason. It cannot be analysed by the rational mind, nor cured by conventional medicine. Anyone who has experienced it understands that it must simply be followed to its natural resolution.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>EMH:  Which is what, exactly?</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>TUVOK:  There are three options that I am aware of. Taking a mate, which Ensign Vorik has already attempted. The ritual combat which does not apply to his situation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>EMH:  Combat?</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>TUVOK:  An ancient tradition of fighting for one's mate which as I have said, is not relevant here. The third alternative is the intensive meditation he has chosen to try.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>EMH:  Isn't there anything we can do to help him with that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I believe that any interference would be unwelcome and counterproductive. You must allow him to face this challenge privately. If he possesses enough discipline to reach a point of psychological resolution, then his chemical imbalance should correct itself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>EMH:  The Vulcan brain never ceases to amaze me. Thank you, Lieutenant. You've been a great help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>TORRES:  Oh, it'll take a little more work than that to impress me, Lieutenant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>TORRES:  He's not coming. This seems to be the most accessible vein of gallicite. We'll beam to the surface, then go down through this passageway until it dead ends in this chamber. Then we'll descend almost fifty metres, almost straight down. Do you see any problem with that, Tom?</td></tr>
