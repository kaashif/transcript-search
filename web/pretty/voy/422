<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>EMH:  I've analysed a sample of the gases from the nebula. I think the damage came from subnucleonic radiation. Even the briefest exposure is devastating to organic tissue.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Ordinarily not at all, but this is an unusual situation. After being in the Collective, it wasn't easy for you to adjust to a ship with only a hundred and fifty people on it, was it, Seven? How would you feel with only the Doctor for company?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>SEVEN:  I will adapt.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Most humans don't react particularly well to long periods of isolation. Borg Drones have even more difficulty.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>SEVEN:  As you pointed out, I am neither Borg nor human. I can do this, Captain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  All right. I'll work with the senior staff to draw up a list of duties. But let me make it clear. The Doctor will be in command. You will follow his instructions just as you would follow mine.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  The Doctor assures me it'll be just like taking a nap. We'll go into the units, our cardiopulmonary systems will be slowed, neural activity suspended, and we'll wake up feeling as though we'd had a good night's sleep.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I think we're all feeling uneasy about this, and I'd be lying if I said I don't have concerns myself. And I think it's about loss of control. We always feel better if we think we're in charge of our own circumstances. In stasis, we're giving up that control, and no Starfleet officer likes to do that. But crews have been in stasis much longer than a month. I think we can handle this. All right. You're free until seventeen hundred hours. I'll make a ship-wide announcement when the Doctor's ready. Dismissed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe. But my concern isn't about going into stasis. It's about who you're leaving in charge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe you need to step outside yourself for a minute. Look at the fact that here's someone who's butted horns with you from the moment she came on board. Who disregards authority and actively disobeys orders when she doesn't agree with them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  And this is the person I'm giving responsibility for the lives of this entire crew. I suppose you want me to tell you I'm not crazy?</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  In a nutshell. I know your bond with Seven is unique, different from everyone else's. From the beginning, you've seen things in her that no one else could. But maybe you could help me understand some of those things.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I don't know if I can. It's just instinct. There's something inside me that says she can be redeemed. In spite of her insolent attitude, I honestly believe she wants to do well by us.</td></tr>
