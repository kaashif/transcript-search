<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>BENNET:  All this time I thought I was so lucky. No family back home. Nobody to miss. Now it seems kind of sad not to leave anybody behind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Bennet dies. Tuvok sets up a stasis field over his body then hears a rustling in the bushes. He takes out his phaser and turns to see that it is a young girl. She tries to run across the clearing and he grabs her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Some cultures, like Mister Bennet's, consider an appropriate burial to be a sign of respect. Tressa, is there anyone else here with you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>SOMEONE: Captain's log, supplemental. I've sent out scouting parties to analyse the mineral deposits in the moons around Drayan Two. Meanwhile, I've arranged to meet with the planet's leader.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  According to Neelix, nobody's had direct contact with the Drayans for decades. All he's heard are rumours.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Do any of those rumours describe them as hostile?</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  No, just very private.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Turbolift</td></tr>
<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  That's something. Deck four. My diplomacy professor used to say the opening twenty minutes of a first contact situation are the most crucial.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I'd feel better about this particular twenty minutes if we had some idea what to expect.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Sometimes you have to go in blind. That's the exciting part. When I was a science officer I always envied the Captain's privilege of making first contact with new races.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Corridor</td></tr>
<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I envied it so much I almost got myself shipped back to the academy for remedial training. On my first assignment we were sent to make contact with the Tarkannans. I studied all the information we had about them and pestered the Captain into letting me be part of the diplomatic team. When we came face to face with the Tarkannan delegation I very proudly made the traditional gesture for hello, not realising that males and females of their race use different styles of movement, and I was actually propositioning the Ambassador.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>ALCIA:  First Prelate Alcia. May this day find you at peace and leave you with hope. That's a traditional blessing from our ancient scrolls.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Om-nah-hoo-pez-nyeetz. That's from the spirits of my people. It means, peace in your heart, fortune in your steps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  It's very gracious of you to agree to meet with us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>ALCIA:  We don't often engage in dialogue with alien races, but your story of crossing the galaxy intrigued me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'd be glad to tell you all about our journey and my crew. Perhaps you'd like to see more of our ship as well.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  The reaction chamber is equipped with a compositor which allows us to re-crystallise the dilithium. In our situation we can never be sure when we'll be able to find a new supply.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'm sorry my Chief Engineer isn't here to meet you. She's leading one of the away teams surveying the moons around Drayan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>ALCIA:  I find it interesting that you chose this to show me first. Do your people consider advanced technology to be their highest achievement?</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Not as an end in itself. The purpose of all this is to help up gain knowledge about the universe and the people in it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>ALCIA:  Our ancestors were brilliant scientists and engineers. They were continually developing better, smarter, more efficient machines, until the technology became more important than the people. I believe our society would have self-destructed if it weren't for the reformation. My great-grandfather helped to return us to ourselves, and since that time we've remained isolated to avoid the influence of those who might lead us back down the wrong path.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Some human cultures have done the same.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Attendants?</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>TRESSA:  The people on our ship. They got us to the escape pod before they crashed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>CORIN:  Can we go now? I want to go.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>ELANI:  Are we going to fly in your ship?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>CORIN:  He said it was a shuttle, not a ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>TUVOK:  We cannot leave yet. My shuttle is in need of repairs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>TRESSA:  Can't you fix it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I believe so. However, I am more concerned with getting through the electrodynamic turbulence in the ionosphere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>CORIN:  What's electro-turbulence?</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>TUVOK:  A thermal inversion gradient is causing unusually strong and unpredictable currents in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Those currents caused my shuttle to crash, and I assume yours as well. I must find a way to safely navigate through the turbulence before we can attempt to leave.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>TRESSA:  Will that take a long time?</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>TUVOK:  It may. You must be patient.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>ELANI:  I don't want to stay here any more. I don't like it here.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Your displeasure doesn't change our situation. Nor does it bring us any closer to a solution</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>TRESSA:  You don't have to be so mean about it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>TUVOK:  It isn't my intention to be mean. I only wish to provide you with a realistic assessment. Vulcan parents never shield their children from the truth. Doing so would only hinder their ability to cope with inevitable difficulties.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>CORIN:  I'm hungry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>TUVOK:  There is a supply of Starfleet rations in the shuttle.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>TUVOK:  We have only rations. Now, I must begin working on my shuttle. By my estimate we have fewer than four hours of daylight remaining.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>CORIN:  That's when the Morrok comes.</td></tr>

I'm sure nothing unfortunate will happen to you on your visit here, but if it did you can rest assured you will find yourself in very capable hands. We are fully equipped to provide a wide variety of treatments here from removing a splinter to re-sequencing the base pairs in a strand of DNA, and our research facilities are the most advanced in Starfleet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  You may be even more interested to learn that this man isn't really a biological lifeform. He's a computer generated holographic projection.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>ALCIA:  My people believe that physical matter is only an illusion. The body is not the true self, only a representation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  One of our greatest philosophers, Plato, wrote that what we see around us are only poor shadows of ideal objects which exist on a higher plane.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>ALCIA:  That is similar to our teachings. Our connection to what you call a higher plane is more important than our attachment to this brief existence, however real it may seem.</td></tr>
