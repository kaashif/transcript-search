<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  That's out of the question. It would show disrespect to the spirits.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>EMH:  Her lifesigns are very weak but stable. It appears that her synaptic pathways have undergone severe neuraleptic shock which is disrupting all cortical functions. It is similar to a comatose state, but with none of the usual biochemical markers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  We're working on that. We aren't allowed near the area where the accident occurred, but Kim and Torres are scanning the sanctuary from Voyager. They'll report their findings to you. And I have an appointment to talk to the magistrate. I'm hoping he'll be able to cut through some of the restrictions the monks have set up.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Excuse me, Captain. I'd like to do something to help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  Please understand, Captain, I'm caught in a most difficult situation. I'm an official of the government, not a spiritual leader. I don't pretend to understand why the spirits do what they do.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Then perhaps I could talk with the brothers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  I've asked the Nechisti Council to give you an audience, but I'm afraid they consider the matter closed. They've asked me to express their sympathies for your loss.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  There is no loss at this point. Kes is still alive. Surely there's some way to treat her? Can't you insist that the monks meet with me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  We have an agreement with Council. They don't involve themselves with government and we don't interfere in their spiritual matters. It's been that way for centuries and it's always worked well for us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Then can you tell me what you do know about the sanctuary and what happens there?</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  I'll try. That particular shrine is where the monks go to receive the gift of purification, cleansing of the soul. It is one of our most holy places.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  You mean the monks can enter it without being harmed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  They prepare themselves with a sacred ritual during which they speak directly with the Ancestral Spirits. After that they are able to enter the shrine safely.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  What happens in that ritual? How does it offer protection against the energy field?</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  Captain, you seem to want explanations for everything. I don't have them. Only the brothers who've gone through the ritual know what happens there, and they're sworn to secrecy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  The energy field that Kes encountered, is there anyone who could give me scientific information that would help us analyse it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  All we know is that it is a naturally occurring phenomenon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  If you're telling me that there's nothing you can do to help Kes, I simply won't accept that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE:  If I could help you, I would. I swear it. I blame myself. If I'd watched more carefully, seen that she was approaching the shrine. There's nothing more to be done now. You have our sympathy.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Doctor's office</td></tr>
<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Have Kim and Torres given you a report?</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>EMH:  Yes. I received a fascinating lesson in the challenges of getting clear scanner readings through solid rock. We were eventually able to distinguish an intense biogenic field at the site of Kes's accident. That would certainly explain the neuraleptic shock. She was lucky not to have been killed instantly.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  As I understand it, the Nechani monks are able to enter the field without being harmed at all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>EMH:  Really? I don't expect they'd care to tell us how.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  No, they wouldn't.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Neelix enters Sickbay and goes to Kes' bedside.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>EMH:  She's not responding to conventional treatments, and frankly I'm running out of unconventional ideas as well. The level of activity in her brain is so low I can't rule out the possibility of permanent damage, even if I can revive her. The longer she stays in this condition, the less likely it is she'll ever recover.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>NEELIX:  How is she?</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>EMH:  I'm afraid there's been no change.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>NEELIX:  I've researched everything I could find about the sacred shrine. I didn't uncover much scientific evidence, but there was one story, it was in a very old text, I'm not sure how reliable, about a boy who recovered from a condition like Kes's. He was a young prince. He wandered into the shrine accidentally and he went into a death sleep. Everyone said it was the will of the spirits. His father, King Nevad, refused to accept that, so he went through the ritual to seek an audience with the spirits and he pleaded for his son's life. The spirits in their infinite mercy granted his request. That was the only trace of hope that I could find.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Maybe it's enough.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Bridge</td></tr>
<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE [on viewscreen]:  Well, you've certainly done your research, Captain. I'm familiar with the story. I heard it as a child.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  It suggests that there's still a chance for Kes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE [on viewscreen]:  You're talking about a very specific case. Nevad was able to claim responsibility for the prince as a father and as a king. That's why the spirits were willing to listen to him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  The Captain of a starship is fully responsible for every member of her crew.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE [on viewscreen]:  So she is.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  And on that basis, I'd like to go through the ritual myself.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Chakotay's office</td></tr>
<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I haven't heard from the Magistrate yet, but he seemed to think there was a strong possibility the monks would let me go through the ritual.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Captain, forgive me, but you've never been one to put much trust in religious ceremonies. Exactly what is it you hope to accomplish?</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  If you're asking if I expect to speak to the Ancestral Spirits, no, of course not. But something happens to the monks when they go through the ritual. Something that allows them to withstand the effects of the biogenic field. I want to find out what that is. It might provide clues to a treatment.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Some kind of physiological change, maybe.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  That's what I'm guessing. The shamans of the Karis tribe on Delios Seven practice a ritual that increases the electrical resistance of their skin. It protects them from plasma discharges in their sacred caves. Something similar must happen during this ritual.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  We'll have to find a way to allow the Doctor to monitor your physical condition, and you should have a way to call for an emergency beam out if you need it. As a precaution. We don't have any idea what the ritual entails.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I've been reviewing the Federation's cultural database. Most traditional spirit quest ceremonies involve some kind of physical challenge or test of endurance to prove the mastery of spirit over body. My instinct tells me this one will be similar. A series of ordeals that will result in biochemical changes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Of course there's always the possibility that the Ancestral Spirits really do control what happens in the shrine.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  To each his own, Commander, but I imagine if we scratch deep enough we'd find a scientific basis for most religious doctrines.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I remember when my mother taught me the science underlying the vision quest. In a way I felt disappointed. Some of the mystery was gone. Maybe the Nechani have chosen not to lose the mystery.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Under other circumstances I'd be more than happy to go along with their choice. Right now, it's killing one of my crew.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>KIM [OC]:  Bridge to the Captain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE [on monitor]:  I must congratulate you, Captain. Your creative approach to this problem has fascinated the Nechisti Council.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE [on monitor]:  Eagerly. They consider it an honour that you want to seek the spirits. The ritual traditionally begins at sunset. A guide will meet you at the entrance to the sanctuary.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>MAGISTRATE [on monitor]:  I have been greatly troubled by your misfortune, Captain. If you are able to convince the spirits to spare your friend, no one would be happier than I.</td></tr>
