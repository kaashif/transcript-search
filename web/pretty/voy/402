<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>RAFIN:  It's told they all wear the same horrid face. Their flesh is gnarled and blistery like the rotting trunks. Their glimpses flame like fire, And if you dare near enough, their breath stinks of muck.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  You know, sometimes people say terrible things about their enemies to make them seem worse than they really are. There might be some young Kradin soldier out there who's more afraid of you than you are of him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>RAFIN:  The nemesis wasn't scared to fume my village, nor scared to nullify my cousins and brothers in their sleep. And my old mother's mother, too, who never told an unkind word nor nullified an insect in all her days and nights on this sphere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  That's pretty rough.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>RAFIN:  And who but a Krady beast would leave the nullified bodies of mine and ours upturned, so they'll never descend to the gloried Wayafter?</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>NAMON:  Then the nemesis you nullified wasn't half so beastly as the Kradin.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>NAMON:  In their glimpsers, we're less than nothing. They flame our homes, take our plantings, make playthings of our sisters. If you were a Vori you'd crave to drive them from this sphere just as I do.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe I would, if they did things like that to the people I loved. But on the sphere I come from we try to find other ways to resolve differences. Peaceful solutions, Negotiations.</td></tr>
