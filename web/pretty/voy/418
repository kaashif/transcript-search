<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>SEVEN:  Those orders were issued as a result of Starfleet's ignorance and fear. I can alleviate your ignorance. As for your fear</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Sometimes fear should be respected, Seven. Tell me, how many Borg were sacrificed during this experiment?</td></tr>

In their absence, we're going to have to make do with the training I've received, and the knowledge Seven of Nine has retained from the Borg. You've all seen this symbol. Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet. Chosen by Starfleet to represent a threat not only to the Federation, but to the entire galaxy. Only starship captains and Federation Flag Officers have been briefed on the nature of this threat. What you're about to hear will not go beyond these bulkheads, is that clear? Good.</td></tr>

As I was watching it, it seemed to be watching me. The Borg have assimilated many species with mythologies to explain such moments of clarity. I've always dismissed them as trivial. Perhaps I was wrong.</td></tr>
