<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Judging by your sensor logs, it looks like you ran into it after your deflector field collapsed, but the big question is, how did it get in this quadrant?</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>TORRES:  What do you mean? (She takes the piece of metal from Chakotay, and sees the insignia on it. A circle with one big elongated diamond and two small curved triangles sticking out from it.)</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  And it's old. That's about all we know. Looks like the Klingons beat Starfleet to the Delta Quadrant by a few hundred years. You may be holding the most important archaeological find in Klingon history.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>TORRES:  Remind me to plant a flag on behalf of the Empire. You know, the simplest explanation is that the Borg assimilated a Bird of Prey somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant and they blew it out an airlock on their way home.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>KIM:  It's a hunk of metal. What you heard may have had nothing to do with this artefact. Maybe the comm. system picked up some stray signal from a pulsar. I don't know.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Ah! Just the Daughter of the Empire I've been looking for. I wanted to be the first to congratulate you on your discovery of the Klingon artefact.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Some of the greatest discoveries in Klingon history were accidents. When Sarpek the Fearless unearthed the Knife of Kirom he was searching for his lost targ. Isn't that amazing? I've been doing some research.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>TORRES:  Neelix, look, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but since I'm the only Klingon on board, there's really no point in throwing a party.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Oh, nonsense. This artefact isn't just a testament to Klingon spirit. It's a piece of the Alpha Quadrant. A symbol of Voyager's home. And that's just as worthy of celebration and song as finding some old knife.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>KIM:  The man's got a point.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>NEELIX:  And besides, I've already replicated five barrels of bloodwine. I'm not going to let them go to waste.

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters</td></tr>
<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Do not underestimate the power of the mind. The artefact was a catalyst for your already active imagination. It served as an unwelcome reminder of your ancestry. The self-loathing you experience when you look in the mirror and see a Klingon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>TORRES:  Who said anything about self-loathing?</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>TUVOK:  You despise being Klingon. It's no secret. What you experienced in your quarters was a subconscious manifestation of that hatred. The blood in your veins, the voices of your ancestors, all symbols of your Klingon heritage.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>TORRES:  And when the blood disappeared that was, what, me trying to vaporise that part of myself?</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Quite simple. That despite your efforts to become something else, whether it be Starfleet or Maquis, your Klingon nature continues to assert itself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>TORRES:  That's an intriguing theory.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Perhaps we should forego your meditation in favour of a different exercise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>TORRES:  Fine by me. (Tuvok fetches a bat'leth.)</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Feel the weight of the bat'leth in your hands. Describe the first thought that enters your mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>TORRES:  It's a clumsy weapon. Overstated, like everything else Klingon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>TUVOK:  It's a warrior's blade, crafted for precision and balance. Observe.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Tuvok twirls the big blade around his body and head, ending up with the long curved edge inches from Torres' neck. The final set of fast moves end up cutting her cheek.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>TUVOK:  You're not worthy of the blood in your veins. A true Klingon would try to kill me where I stand.</td></tr>
