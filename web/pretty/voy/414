<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I analysed some of their logs. From what I can tell, this is a hunting species. We saw the skeletal remains from dozens of alien races displayed like trophies. There was also evidence they may be using some of their victims for food. The entire culture seems to be based on the hunt. Social rituals, art, religious beliefs. They're nomadic. Their existence is driven by the pursuit of prey and it's carried them across huge distances.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>TUVOK:  There is no evidence of a home planet. Their ships travel alone or in small groups. On occasion, several will join forces in a multi-pronged attack.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>SEVEN:  You were correct, Captain. It was worth the risk. This time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  So there's one question remaining. Who's hunting the hunters?</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>EMH:  I've already tried. His immune system neutralises everything. I could synthesise a more potent compound, but that would take hours. He could be dead by then. His wounds are severe.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Your crewmate is dead, and your ship has been damaged beyond repair. I brought you here to treat your injuries. What happened to your ship?

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>ALPHA:  Yes. A formidable alien. We captured it two days ago, but it broke free of its restraints, attacked us. Release me. I must continue the hunt.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Not without your ship, and not in this condition. You'll die without treatment. Let us help you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I want to buy the Doctor enough time to treat our hunter. If I gain his confidence, he might call off his friends. Good old-fashioned diplomacy could get us out of this yet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L117"><td><a href="#L117">117</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Don't count on it. From what I found in their database, diplomacy isn't a part of their lifestyle. They don't see us as equals. To them, we're simply game.</td></tr>

One night, during a break in the fighting, we could hear this low moaning sound coming from somewhere in the brush. We knew that none of our people were out there, so it had to be a wounded Cardassian. You have to understand, we'd been killing each other for weeks on this planet. It was brutal. But our commanding officer decided that we couldn't just sit there and listen to that poor man suffer. So he ordered me and an Ensign to crawl out there and bring that Cardassian back to our camp. I thought he was crazy. He was risking our lives for someone who would have shot us without hesitation. But we did it, and the Cardassian lived. Three days later we secured the outpost. It was a major victory. We were all decorated by Starfleet Command.</td></tr>
