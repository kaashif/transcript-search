<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>PARIS:  That was the manufacturing date, 1936. Ford was the name of the company that build it. Antique vehicles are a hobby of mine.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I think you'll find that's manure. Horse manure, if I'm not mistaken. Judging from the mud on the wheels, and the alfalfa seedlings stuck in the metal frame, I'd say this vehicle belonged to a farmer, or at least someone who lived in a rural area. But the question is, how did it get here? I doubt there are many twentieth century farmers driving around the Delta Quadrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L128"><td><a href="#L128">128</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  She was one of the first female pilots in Earth History. In the mid twentieth century she became quite famous for flying across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1937 she attempted to fly around the world. According to the records of the time, on July 2nd 1937 Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, took off from New Guinea and they were headed east, around the Equator. But somewhere in the South Seas they vanished and their disappearance became one of the most celebrated mysteries of the twentieth century.</td></tr>

<tr id="L130"><td><a href="#L130">130</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  That was the most commonly held theory. However, numerous searches of the area failed to produce the wreckage of an aircraft, so people began to speculate. Some thought she'd been shot down and captured by the Japanese Navy. Others thought that she and Noonan had flown off together on some sort of romantic adventure. Of course, the most ridiculed notion was that she had been abducted by aliens.</td></tr>

<tr id="L131"><td><a href="#L131">131</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Well, it certainly looks like that's what happened. From what we can tell, all eight of the people in that stasis chamber were taken from Earth in the 1930's and brought here.</td></tr>

<tr id="L138"><td><a href="#L138">138</a></td><td>TORRES:  Is that wise? We don't know how these people are going to react when they wake up in an alien world in the twenty fourth century.</td></tr>

<tr id="L139"><td><a href="#L139">139</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  True, but I'm not willing to just leave them in stasis for another four hundred years.
