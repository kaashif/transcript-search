<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Er, some sort of power overload. I'm afraid it decimated your breakfast. This is what my mother would call a tragic ending.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Engineering has been making adjustments to the plasma conduits to accommodate a new energy source. It may have created a thermal surge in the galley systems.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Yes, and possibly large amounts of it. If so, we're going to need to stockpile as much as we can. I'd like to convert storage bay three into a containment chamber.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Of course, Captain. You know, if I injected sirillium into my thermal array, it might improve cooking time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>TORRES:  Yes, and blow up half your kitchen in the process. Sirillium is far more useful as a warp plasma catalyst.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>KIM:  It's a class seventeen nebula. I'm detecting standard amounts of hydrogen, and helium, and seven thousand parts per million of sirillium.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>TORRES:  Captain, I recommend we use the Bussard collectors to gather the sirillium. They'll cut through that nebula like ice cream scoops.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>PARIS:  I'm picking up a lot of plasmatic turbulence in there. It might be a bumpy ride.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I was holding a young girl by the hand, tying to prevent her from falling from a precipice. I was unable to keep my grip, and she fell to her death. And there is more. I had an emotional response anxiety, fear. An almost irrational anger at myself for letting her fall.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>KES:  When did that happen?</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>TUVOK:  It never happened. The girl was unfamiliar, and I've never been in that situation. It was me as a child, and it did seem like a memory, but I don't recall the incident.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>EMH:  Well, it was definitely a traumatic episode. Your heart rate accelerated to three hundred beats per minute. Your adrenaline levels rose by one hundred thirteen percent and your neuroelectrical readings nearly jumped off the scale. If you were human, I'd say you had a severe panic attack.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I am not human.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>EMH:  No kidding. I don't know what happened to you, but there can be any number of explanations. Hallucination, telepathic communication from another race, repressed memory, momentary contact with a parallel reality. Take your pick. The universe is such a strange place.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'll have Mister Kim examine the sensor logs. Maybe our proximity to the nebula is affecting you somehow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>EMH:  In the meantime, Lieutenant, you are free to go. All of your vital signs have returned to normal, and I don't see any residual systemic damage. But I want you to wear this neurocortical monitor. In case you have another episode, it'll record a complete encephalographic profile and alert sickbay at the same time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The EMH places the device behind Tuvok's left ear.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>TUVOK:  A wise precaution, Doctor. Thank you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Structure, logic, function, control. A structure cannot stand without a foundation. Logic is the foundation of function. Function is the essence of control. I am in control. I am in control.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: But the house of not-cards collapses, then the doorbell chimes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>KES:  The doctor wanted me to adjust your neurocortical monitor to pick up additional peptide readings. I can come back later if this is a bad time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>TUVOK:  The approximate translation is structure of harmony. It is used as a meditational aid. Building it requires precise balance and spatial acuity. It helps to focus thought and refine mental control.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>KES:  At the moment, it doesn't look very harmonious.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>TUVOK:  No, it does not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>KES:  I'm curious. What does a keethara look like when it's done?</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>TUVOK:  The form is not predefined. It is a reflection of the builder's state of mind. Thus, it is different each time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>KES:  I'd like to see it when it's finished. Well, good night.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Kes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>TUVOK:  My apologies, Commander. I am distracted. I spent fourteen hours last night in deep meditation, trying to determine the source of my aberrant behaviour. I could not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe you should try to forget about it for a while. I've found that when you don't think about a problem, sometimes the solution comes to you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>KIM:  I checked all the sensor logs. There's no sign of anything emanating from the nebula that would have affected Tuvok or Voyager.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Yes. Yes, you are right, of course. I'm uncertain why I would make such an obvious error.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>EMH:  I think we may be dealing with a repressed memory. The memory engrams in the dorsal region of the hippocampus are being disrupted. It's causing physical damage to the surrounding tissue. In Vulcan medicine, this is known as t'lokan schism. It means that the subject is inhibiting a traumatic memory, which is beginning to resurface.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  And that's causing brain damage?</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>EMH:  Strange, I know. In human subjects, repressed memories are nothing more than psychological traumas which can be dealt with, with standard therapeutic techniques. But in Vulcans, there is a physical reaction to the battle between the conscious and the unconscious. In extreme cases, the mind of the patient can literally lobotomise itself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  What's the treatment?</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>EMH:  There is no medical treatment for this condition. Vulcan psychocognitive research suggests that the patient initiate a mind-meld with a family member, and the two of them attempt to bring the repressed memory into the conscious mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'm the closest thing Tuvok has to a family member on this ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I don't know how else to proceed. The doctor tells me that this is a memory. And yet, no matter how hard I try, I cannot remember. If the doctor is correct, if this is an experience I pushed into my unconscious mind, it could be very dangerous to me, even life-threatening. I realise it's asking a great deal of you, Captain, and I did consider turning to one of the Vulcans on the ship, but this meld would be more intimate than most. A family member is normally chosen because of the implicit trust that usually exists. On this ship, I trust you more than anyone else.</td></tr>

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>TUVOK:  My guide, my counsellor. You will help me reconstruct the memory in its entirety. And as I am reliving it, you will help me to objectify the experience. By processing the experience, rather than repressing it, I can begin to overcome my fear, anger and the other emotional responses, and to reintegrate the memory into my conscious mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L117"><td><a href="#L117">117</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  When I'm in your memory, will I actually be reliving it with you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L118"><td><a href="#L118">118</a></td><td>TUVOK:  No. I will be the only one who notices your presence. You will be an observer in the memory, but not a participant. This will give you the freedom to guide me objectively.</td></tr>
