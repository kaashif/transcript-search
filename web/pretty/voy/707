  ANNOTATION
     A piece of it is beamed into a sample jar. The
     ship shakes.

  EMH
     Ensign Kim, please try and hold us steady. This
     material is extremely


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - cockpit

  EMH [OC]
     Fragile.

  KIM
     Sorry, Doc. I'm doing the best I can.

  EMH [OC]
     Maybe I should've insisted


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  EMH
     On a more experienced pilot, like Mister Paris.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - cockpit

  KIM
     I'd give anything to trade places with him right
     now.

  EMH [OC]
     Seven, can you join me, please?

  SEVEN
     On my way.

  KIM
     I don't know if I can take three more days of
     chasing comets with him.

  SEVEN
     The time might pass more easily if we disable his
     vocal processor.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  EMH
     I thought you might find this interesting.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH puts a small piece of comet under a
     microscope and calls the image up on a monitor.

  SEVEN
     Preanimate biomatter.

  EMH
     Look deeper.

  SEVEN
     An undeveloped nucleus contained in a cytoplasmic
     matrix.

  EMH
     And buried deep inside that nucleus, primitive
     strands of DNA. The beginnings of life, Seven.

  SEVEN
     What's your point?

  EMH
     When I look at this, I don't see a mere cell. I
     see the potential for literature and art, empires
     and kingdoms.

  SEVEN
     Perhaps your visual subroutines are
     malfunctioning.

  EMH
     Someday, this cytoplasmic matrix may fall into the
     primordial sea of a distant world where it could
     ignite an evolutionary process. Eons from now, a
     creature not unlike you could emerge, look up at
     the stars and ask, who am I? How did I come to be?
     It's the miracle of creation, Seven. Doesn't that
     excite you?

  ANNOTATION
     Shudder!

  EMH
     Ensign Kim, I asked you to hold us steady.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - cockpit

  KIM
     We're under attack! This is the Federation ship
     Delta Flyer. We're on a peaceful mission. Hold
     your fire.

  RANEK [OC]
     You're transporting a suspected photonic insurgent
     through Lokirrim space. Drop your shields and
     prepare to be boarded.

  KIM
     Photonic insurgent? If you're referring to the
     hologram, he's our doctor. Seven, we've lost
     thrusters.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  SEVEN
     I'll try reinitialising the driver coils.

  KIM [OC]
     Voyager, this is the Flyer. Mayday.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - cockpit

  KIM
     Come in.

  COMPUTER
     Subspace communications are offline.

  SEVEN [OC]
     It's a tractor beam.

  KIM
     Remodulate our shields.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  KIM [OC]
     That should break us free.

  SEVEN
     Shields are down.

  EMH
     (flickering) What's happening?

  SEVEN
     They're using some kind of disruption field. It's
     decompiling your matrix.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - cockpit

  RANEK [OC]
     Federation vessel, power down your systems and
     prepare to surrender the photonic.

  KIM
     Seven, they're pulling us in. You're going to have
     to hide the Doctor's programme.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  EMH
     Do something, please.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - cockpit

  ANNOTATION
     Four armed people beam in. A woman speaks.

  JARYN
     We don't want to hurt you. We're here for the
     insurgent.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  RANEK
     Where's the photonic?

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is more animated, and her voice uses more
     inflections.

  EMH-SEVEN
     You decompiled his matrix. You murdered him.

  KIM
     Seven?

  EMH-SEVEN
     I'm sorry. There wasn't enough time.

  JARYN
     Biogenic material. It could be used to create
     viral weapons.

  RANEK
     Confiscate it.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Our Doctor was using these spores to synthesise
     new medicines, not weapons.

  RANEK
     What's this?

  ANNOTATION
     Seven has the mobile emitter in her hand.

  EMH-SEVEN
     It's my portable regeneration unit. I have a
     unique physiology. This device maintains my
     cybernetic systems.

  RANEK
     Have this analysed.

  LOKIRRIM
     Yes, sir.

  JARYN
     There's no one else aboard.

  RANEK
     Take them to detention, and secure their ship in
     the docking bay.

  KIM
     You got what you wanted. Let us go.

  RANEK
     Transporting photonics and manufacturing biogenic
     weapons are serious charges.

  LOKIRRIM
     Let's go.


LOCATION--Lokirrim ship - corridor

  KIM
     I want to talk to your superior.


LOCATION--Lokirrim ship - Detention cell

  EMH-SEVEN
     Careful, Ensign, or you'll fracture a metacarpal.

  KIM
     That'd be the least of our problems.

  EMH-SEVEN
     The situation is not as desperate as it appears.

  KIM
     Not as desperate? We're prisoners on an alien
     ship. Voyager has no idea we're missing, and the
     Doctor's been decompiled.

  EMH-SEVEN
     The reports of my decompilation have been greatly
     exaggerated.

  KIM
     Doc?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
     Seven downloaded my programme into her cybernetic
     matrix. An interesting sensation, to say the
     least.

  KIM
     And now you're in control of Seven's body?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Total control, it seems.

  KIM
     What about Seven? Is she all right?

  EMH-SEVEN
     I scanned her before the aliens came aboard.
     Physiologically, she's fine. As for her
     consciousness, I'm assuming it's submerged, but
     there's no way to be sure until I vacate her
     systems and conduct a neurological exam.

  KIM
     Then we need the mobile emitter.

  EMH-SEVEN
     This experience will make a fascinating article
     for the Starfleet medical journal.

  ANNOTATION
     S/he touches the cell forcefield.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Ow!

  KIM
     Careful. That's not your body, remember?

  EMH-SEVEN
     I know Seven's senses were more acute than the
     average humanoid but, I had no idea. What is that?

  KIM
     What?

  EMH-SEVEN
     That smell.

  KIM
     I don't smell anything.

  EMH-SEVEN
     It could be an airborne toxin. Do you think
     they're trying to poison us?

  ANNOTATION
     S/he sniffs Kim.

  EMH-SEVEN
     It's you.

  KIM
     It's been a busy day. I guess I'm perspiring a
     little.

  EMH-SEVEN
     A little? Seven's had a busy day too, and she's
     come through it smelling like the proverbial rose.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, stardate 54238.3. We've completed
     our maintenance layover at the Maldorian station
     and we're on our way to rendezvous with the Delta
     Flyer. We expect to reach them in forty eight
     hours.


LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok is trembling whilst trying to meditate.
     Paris is doing a medical scan.

  PARIS
     Headache, fever, respiratory distress, tremors. It
     looks like some kind of virus.

  TUVOK
     It is not a virus.

  PARIS
     You want to tell me what's going on?

  TUVOK
     In the Doctor's database, you'll find a medication
     under file theta twelve alpha. Please, replicate
     it immediately.

  PARIS
     You know I can't give out medicine without knowing
     what it's for.

  TUVOK
     If you must know, I am suffering from a
     neurochemical imbalance.

  PARIS
     An imbalance.

  TUVOK
     It is native to my species.

  PARIS
     Ah. This wouldn't be the kind of imbalance that
     comes around once every seven years?

  TUVOK
     My pon farr is in the early stages. The urges are
     still controllable.

  PARIS
     You never fail to amaze me, Tuvok. A man of your
     advanced years still driven by the mating
     instinct?

  TUVOK
     Unlike in humans, the Vulcan libido increases with
     time.

  PARIS
     Well, I guess there has to be some kind of reward
     for all that Vulcan discipline.

  TUVOK
     The Doctor anticipated my needs and developed a
     treatment. Combined with meditation, it will
     enable me to control the symptoms.

  PARIS
     Well, if that doesn't work, there's always a cold
     sonic shower. I'll tell the captain that you'll be
     out of commission for a couple of days.

  TUVOK
     She will want to know why.

  PARIS
     Well, according to my tricorder, all we've got
     here is a mild case of the Tarkalean flu.

  TUVOK
     Thank you, Lieutenant.


LOCATION--Lokirrim ship - Detention cell

  EMH-SEVEN
     Mmm! I had no idea that eating was such a sensual
     experience. The tastes, the textures, feeling it
     slide down Seven's oesophagus. It's exquisite.

  KIM
     They're prison rations. My uniform probably tastes
     better.

  EMH-SEVEN
     You know, I was thinking. When we get back to
     Voyager, perhaps you and Seven could help me
     modify my physical parameters.

  KIM
     Why?

  EMH-SEVEN
     So I can eat, of course, like any other member of
     the crew.

  KIM
     There's just one small problem. You don't have a
     stomach. Where is the food going to go?

  EMH-SEVEN
     I believe we can construct a holographic stomach
     that can store the food for eventual recycling.

  KIM
     Maybe we should focus on something more
     productive, like getting out of here.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Relax, Ensign. Our shipmates have never let us
     down before. I'm sure the captain will clear up
     this little misunderstanding. In the meantime, are
     you going to finish that?

  ANNOTATION
     Kim hands over his plate.

  JARYN
     You. Come with us.

  KIM
     I'm the senior officer. If you're going to take
     someone, take me.

  JARYN
     My orders were specific.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Don't worry, Ensign. I can take care of myself. My
     compliments to the chef.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  LOKIRRIM
     The prisoner, sir.

  RANEK
     Pulse-phased weapons, duranium-enforced hull. Much
     more sophisticated than the typical smuggler's
     vessel.

  EMH-SEVEN
     How many ways do you want me to say this? We are
     not smugglers, or terrorists. We are explorers.
     Let us contact our ship. Our captain will explain
     everything.

  RANEK
     If you are innocent, then you won't mind telling
     me more about this vessel. For instance, this
     device. What does it do?

  EMH-SEVEN
     That's a standard food replicator.

  RANEK
     Can it be used to create bioweapons?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Not unless you count Mister Neelix's Bolian
     souffl. Let me show you. Computer, one slice of
     New York cheesecake. This is an old Earth
     delicacy.

  RANEK
     How do I know you're not trying to poison me?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Oh, please.

  ANNOTATION
     S/he takes the fork and samples it. The cheesecake
     is even more tasty than expected.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Mmm mmm! Oh, I never imagined. Mmm!

  RANEK
     Is this the first time you've tried that?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Of course not, but it's just that I usually avoid
     foods that are this rich. I do have a figure to
     maintain. Oh, I'd better get another for you.
     Computer, another slice of cheesecake. Here.

  ANNOTATION
     S/he hands the half-eaten one to Ranek. He finds
     it pleasurable, too.

  RANEK
     What other foods can that device create?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Hmm. (One banquet later, EMH-Seven is lying on the
     biobed. They are both drinking alcohol.)

  EMH-SEVEN
     Oh, during my time with the Collective we
     assimilated thousands of cultures from one end of
     the galaxy to the other. I'll say this for the
     Borg, we certainly do travel. Ah, of course, my
     life didn't truly begin until I came aboard
     Voyager, and met the person who changed my life
     The only one who truly believed in me, saw my true
     potential.

  RANEK
     Your Captain.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Our Doctor. That's right, the photonic. If only
     you could have known him. Ruggedly handsome. A
     sharp wit, a towering intellect. If he and I
     hadn't been colleagues. Well, now we'll never know
     what heights he could have reached.

  RANEK
     I hope you understand, I had no choice.

  EMH-SEVEN
     I was just following orders. I've heard that
     before.

  RANEK
     Maybe there's something I could do for you. I'll
     speak to my superiors, ask for leniency.

  EMH-SEVEN
     If I survive that long.

  RANEK
     What do you mean?

  EMH-SEVEN
     My cybernetic components are already depolarising.
     I need my regener regeneration device. As you can
     see, my motor functions are already impaired.

  RANEK
     All right. If I give this back to you, will you do
     something for me?


LOCATION--Lokirrim ship - Detention cell

  EMH-SEVEN
     It was so kind of you to escort me. Ah, nice to
     see you, Ensign.

  KIM
     Are you drunk?

  EMH-SEVEN
     It wasn't my fault. Seven's unique physiology is
     unique. It doesn't react well to synthehol.

  KIM
     What happened?

  EMH-SEVEN
     Captain Ranek and I shared a meal aboard the
     Flyer. He's really a gentleman, once you get to
     know him.

  KIM
     You had a dinner date in Seven's body?

  EMH-SEVEN
     It wasn't a date. It was a tactical manoeuvre
     designed to win the trust of our captors, and it
     worked.

  ANNOTATION
     S/he holds up the mobile emitter.

  KIM
     I won't ask what you had to do to get this.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Nothing unladylike, I assure you. They lost their
     medic to a recent skirmish, and I offered to take
     his place.

  KIM
     Let's download your programme before they change
     their mind. Hey, careful where you point those
     tubules.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     She injects the emitter, and the EMH appears.

  KIM
     Easy. How do you feel?

  SEVEN
     Impaired.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is holding her upset stomach.

  EMH
     You've had quite a shock to your system. Let me
     explain what's happened.

  SEVEN
     I know exactly what's happened. You've been
     abusing my body.

  EMH
     I'm a doctor.

  KIM
     Shush!

  EMH
     I would never abuse your body. I was trying to get
     information. Sometimes a glass of wine can loosen
     the tongue.

  SEVEN
     One glass. That doesn't excuse the other eight.

  EMH
     Was it that many? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

  KIM
     Seven, you were aware of everything?

  SEVEN
     Painfully.

  EMH
     I'm afraid the role of spy wasn't written into my
     programme. I was forced to improvise.

  SEVEN
     You improvised your way through an entire
     cheesecake, as well as three servings of Ktarian
     chocolate puffs. Now I have to suffer the
     consequences.

  EMH
     I apologise if I overindulged. I'll be more
     careful next time.

  SEVEN
     There won't be a next time.

  EMH
     I'll be discovered. They'll decompile my
     programme.

  KIM
     Shush. I know this is difficult for you, but
     you're going to have put up with it until we can
     get out of here.

  SEVEN
     How do you propose we do that?

  KIM
     Maybe you can tap into their comm. system, get a
     message to Voyager.

  EMH
     Deciphering alien computers isn't exactly my
     forte.

  SEVEN
     But it is one of mine. If you can get close enough
     while they're accessing their systems, I'll be
     able to observe their command protocols.

  LOKIRRIM [OC]
     What's the situation?

  JARYN
     The Captain wants the female prisoner in the
     medical bay.

  SEVEN
     We should proceed.

  EMH
     You're saving my life. I want you to know how
     grateful I am.

  SEVEN
     Try to remember that the next time you're tempted
     to overindulge.

  ANNOTATION
     She re-assimilates his programme.


LOCATION--Lokirrim ship - medical bay

  JARYN
     The photonic's viral weapon attacks the cerebral
     cortex. Within days, the victim suffers complete
     synaptic failure.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Well, if we can't stop the virus, we may be able
     to slow its progress. We need to synthesise a
     neural inhibitor. Forgive me, but aren't you the
     ship's tactical officer?

  JARYN
     Tactical officer, medic, engineer. We've lost
     nearly a third of our crew to the photonics.

  EMH-SEVEN
     You certainly know your way around a medical bay.
     You may have missed your true calling.

  JARYN
     Actually, Emmik always thought I'd become a
     teacher. He used to call me the little professor.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Who's Emmik?

  JARYN
     The photonic who helped raise my brother and me.
     He knew more about treating scrapes and bruises
     than any organic Doctor I ever met.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Sounds like someone I'd enjoy meeting.

  JARYN
     Maybe. Before he joined the insurgency.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Why did he do that?

  JARYN
     I ask myself that question every day. We never
     treated him like a servant, but he turned against
     us anyway.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Is it possible he felt subjugated?

  JARYN
     I don't see how. He lived his own life, pursued
     his own interests. He was part of our family. At
     least I thought he was. We should get back to the
     patient.

  EMH-SEVEN
     It could take up to a day to determine if the
     inhibitor is working.

  JARYN
     Thank you.

  EMH-SEVEN
     Don't thank me, thank my ship's doctor. He taught
     me everything I know about medicine. And remember,
     he was a photonic. Actually, you have a lot in
     common with him. He was something of a Jack of all
     trades, too. I suspect you'd have gotten along
     famously. I'm certain he would've taken a liking
     to you.


LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters

  PARIS
     Your neurotransmitters aren't absorbing the
     medication.

  TUVOK
     Can you increase the dosage?

  PARIS
     Not without causing damage to your neocortex. The
     Doc might be able to synthesise a stronger
     medicine, but

  TUVOK
     I'll make the best of the situation until he
     returns.

  PARIS
     I do have one area of expertise that might help.
     The holodeck.

  TUVOK
     I am a married man.

  PARIS
     It's the holodeck, Tuvok. It doesn't count.

  TUVOK
     Is that what you tell your wife?

  PARIS
     No, of course not. My days of rescuing slave girls
     from Planet Ten are history. Look, you have
     photographs of your wife, right? The computer can
     use them to create a replica. You wouldn't be
     breaking your vows if it's a hologram of your
     wife.


LOCATION--Holodeck

  ANNOTATION
     A cave lit with candles.

  T'PEL
     As it was in the dawn of our days, as it will be
     for all tomorrows. To you, my husband, I
     consecrate all that I am.

  TUVOK
     T'Pel, my wife. From you I receive all that I am.

  T'PEL
     As it was in the beginning, so shall it be now.

  TUVOK
     Two bodies, one mind.

  ANNOTATION
     They stroke fingers, then neck-nuzzle.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     I'm picking up a vessel closing at high impulse.
     They're firing.

  CHAKOTAY
     Shields are holding.

  JANEWAY
     Open a channel. This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of
     the Federation Starship Voyager. We're on a
     peaceful mission.

  LOKIRRIM CAPTAIN
     We've detected photonic activity aboard your
     vessel. Drop your shields and prepare to be
     boarded.

  JANEWAY
     Photonic activity?

  PARIS
     Tuvok. He's in holodeck two.

  CHAKOTAY
     They're firing again. It's some kind of photonic
     disrupter directed at holodeck two

  JANEWAY
     Target their weapons array and fire.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop the disrupter.

  CHAKOTAY
     They're hailing.

  JANEWAY
     On screen.

  LOKIRRIM CAPTAIN
     Drop your shields and prepare to receive our
     inspection teams.

  JANEWAY
     You're not in a position to be making demands. Why
     did you fire on us?

  LOKIRRIM CAPTAIN
     Your vessel is carrying photonics through Lokirrim
     space.

  JANEWAY
     We didn't realise that was forbidden. We'd be
     happy to shut down our holodecks.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway gestures to Chakotay, who obeys. T'Pel and
     the cave vanish.
