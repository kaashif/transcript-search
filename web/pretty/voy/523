TEASER

LOCATION--2371 Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager is still under construction at Utopia
     Planitia. Janeway is greeted by an elderly
     Admiral.

  PATTERSON
     You're late.

  JANEWAY
     Sorry, sir.

  PATTERSON
     What's the threshold of the H-two molecule?

  JANEWAY
     Fourteen point seven electron volts.

  PATTERSON
     Third brightest star in Orion?

  JANEWAY
     Viewed from where?

  PATTERSON
     Earth.

  JANEWAY
     Gamma Orionis, or Bellatrix, if you prefer the
     original Arabic name.

  PATTERSON
     Not bad. Now, give me a hug, Katie, that's an
     order.

  JANEWAY
     I wasn't expecting a pop quiz.

  PATTERSON
     Just wanted to make sure all those pips haven't
     made you forget you're a scientist first.

  JANEWAY
     How could they? I still have nightmares about your
     fractal calculus final.


LOCATION--2371 Corridor

  PATTERSON
     There's still some work to be done, but once the
     sawdust clears, I think you'll be impressed.
     Voyager may not be as big as a Galaxy class ship
     but she's quick and smart, like her Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Seven hundred thousand metric tons, fifteen decks,
     and computer systems augmented with bio-neural
     circuitry, top cruising speed warp nine point nine
     seven five.


LOCATION--2371 Turbolift

  PATTERSON
     Deck one.

  JANEWAY
     Of course, I expect to get that up another notch
     or two.

  PATTERSON
     Sounds like you already know your ship pretty
     well.

  JANEWAY
     I've been buried in Voyager's schematics for the
     past three months. I could walk the corridors
     blindfolded.

  PATTERSON
     You might not want to shut your eyes just yet.


LOCATION--2371 Bridge

  PATTERSON
     Captain on the bridge.

  JANEWAY
     As you were. It's bigger than I expected.

  PATTERSON
     Schematics never fully prepare you for the real
     thing.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks to the Captain's chair.

  PATTERSON
     Try it on. Don't get too comfortable, I have more
     to show you.


LOCATION--2371 Ready room

  PATTERSON
     Your home away from home.

  JANEWAY
     Coffee?

  PATTERSON
     Ah, no thanks.

  JANEWAY
     Coffee, black. Any word from Tuvok?

  PATTERSON
     Not yet.

  JANEWAY
     Shouldn't he have made contact by now?

  PATTERSON
     We know he's aboard Chakotay's ship. He's probably
     decided not to risk exposure until he has to.

  JANEWAY
     Catching up with him in the Badlands is going to
     be tricky, even in a ship as quick and smart as
     Voyager. I've heard about a pilot who might make
     the job easier.

  PATTERSON
     Who's that?

  JANEWAY
     Tom Paris.

  PATTERSON
     Admiral Paris's son? Correct me if I'm wrong, but
     he's serving a sentence for

  JANEWAY
     He's made some mistakes. But everybody deserves a
     second chance.

  PATTERSON
     I'll look into it.


LOCATION--2371 Bridge

  JANEWAY
     If it's not too late, I'd like to recalibrate the
     navigational sensors. I think I can enhance the
     range.

  PATTERSON
     Your coffee's not even cold, you're already making
     changes.

  JANEWAY
     Excuse us, Ensign. I like a ship that knows where
     it's going.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven of Nine moves away from the console. She has
     no visible Borg implants.

  PATTERSON
     I assure you, Voyager has the best sensors in the
     fleet.

  JANEWAY
     There's always room for improvement.

  PATTERSON
     I assume you've read (muffled under music)

  JANEWAY
     I have. A few changes (muffled under music)


LOCATION--2371 Briefing room

  SEVEN
     The bridge is clear. No sign of the weapon.

  DUCANE [OC]
     Continue scanning.

  SEVEN
     Acknowledged.

  PATTERSON
     Your briefing room.

  JANEWAY
     Starfleet's most up to date vessel and they still
     can't design a comfortable place to hold a
     meeting. What do you think, Ensign?

  SEVEN
     Captain?

  JANEWAY
     What's your opinion of this room?

  SEVEN
     It is an efficient design.

  JANEWAY
     Well, there you have it, Admiral. It's efficient.
     I must be wrong. Carry on.


LOCATION--2371 Sickbay

  PATTERSON
     We've added a new system we're thinking of
     installing throughout the fleet.

  JANEWAY
     The Emergency Medical Hologram. I'm up to date.
     Computer, activate EMH.

  EMH
     Please state the nature of the medical emergency.

  PATTERSON
     It's programmed with over four million surgical
     procedures.

  EMH
     Five million, and the medical knowledge of over
     three thousand cultures.

  JANEWAY
     Impressive.

  EMH
     Did you call me to chitchat or is there an actual
     emergency?

  JANEWAY
     Its personality could use some work.

  EMH
     I'm designed to practice medicine as efficiently
     as possible. Small talk only compromises my
     performance.

  PATTERSON
     Thank you, Doctor. Computer, deactivate EMH.


LOCATION--2371 Engineering

  CAREY
     Hello.

  SEVEN
     Sir.

  CAREY
     Lieutenant Carey. I don't think we've met.

  SEVEN
     Jameson, Anna, Service number eight six zero seven
     nine zero.

  CAREY
     I'm not security. I'm just trying to get to know
     all the new faces around here. What are you
     working on?

  SEVEN
     I am attempting to realign the EPS manifolds.

  CAREY
     Do you need a hand?

  SEVEN
     No.

  CAREY
     Well, maybe I'll see you in the mess hall later.

  SEVEN
     Unlikely.

  CAREY
     Hmm?

  SEVEN
     I am not a member of Voyager's crew. I'm on
     assignment here at Utopia Planitia.

  CAREY
     Too bad. Well, next time I'm in the neighbourhood,
     I'll drop by and say hello.


LOCATION--2371 Corridor

  JANEWAY
     I wish Starfleet would give me more than three
     weeks. With a little more time we could really
     explore the Badlands.

  PATTERSON
     You haven't changed a bit.


LOCATION--2371 Engineering

  PATTERSON
     Main Engineering. Class nine warp drive, tricyclic
     input manifold. You'll be the first to test it in
     deep space.


LOCATION--2371 Jefferies tube

  SEVEN
     I've localised the temporal distortions. Deck
     four, section thirty nine.

  ANNOTATION
     She opens a panel in a junction. Her enhanced
     sight shows the otherwise invisible object.

  SEVEN
     I've found the weapon.

  DUCANE
     Begin the procedure.


LOCATION--2371 Engineering

  JANEWAY
     Problem?

  CAREY
     One of the EPS relays just went offline.

  JANEWAY
     Voyager's first malfunction.

  CAREY
     I'm sorry, Captain. I tested those systems this
     morning.

  JANEWAY
     As you were, Lieutenant. I've been looking forward
     to getting my hands dirty.


LOCATION--2371 Jefferies tube

  SEVEN
     The weapon is out of phase. You've sent me to the
     wrong time frame.

  DUCANE [OC]
     At least we know where the weapon was placed. Now
     we have to determine when.


LOCATION--2371 Outside the Jefferies tube

  JANEWAY
     This hatch is locked from the inside.

  PATTERSON
     This isn't a secure area. None of these hatches
     should be sealed.

  JANEWAY
     I'm reading some kind of chronoton flux.

  PATTERSON
     Chronotons?

  JANEWAY
     It's coming from inside this Jefferies tube.

  PATTERSON
     Patterson to Security. Seal off deck four.


LOCATION--2371 Jefferies tube

  SEVEN
     I've been detected. I must leave.

  BRAXTON [OC]
     There's too much interference from the weapon.
     Recalibrate your temporal transport beacon.

  SEVEN
     Understood.


LOCATION--2371 Corridor

  JANEWAY
     We can access section thirty nine through here.


LOCATION--2371 Jefferies tube

  BRAXTON [OC]
     Scramble the locking mechanism before they get in.
     Hurry, they're approaching your coordinates.
     You'll need to reset the command controls.

  DUCANE [OC]
     Stand by. We're trying to get you out of there.


LOCATION--Relativity

  BRAXTON
     It's time. Pull her out.

  DUCANE
     There's too much interference. If I transport her
     now we'll damage her bionetic implants.

  BRAXTON
     If we don't, Captain Janeway's going to find her
     and it'll contaminate the timeline.

  DUCANE
     Sir.

  BRAXTON
     Now.

  CREWMAN
     Temporal transport in progress.


LOCATION--2371 Jefferies tube

  JANEWAY
     Question, Admiral. What causes a chronoton flux of
     point zero zero three?

  PATTERSON
     I don't know.

  JANEWAY
     Neither do I, but whoever or whatever it was, it's
     gone now.


LOCATION--Relativity transporter room

  CREWMAN
     The subject is approaching the temporal threshold.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven of Nine solidifies, then collapses.
