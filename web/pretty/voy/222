One was a direct ancestor of ours, Chakotay. His name was Ce Acatl. He became a great leader of our people. Here is a man who was given life without his mother's consent.

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>EMH [on monitor]:  Really? In that case, you may expect several more on a variety of matters in the near future. Right now may I suggest that we also consider attempting to create an actual holographic illusion of friendly ships?</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>TORRES:  With all due respect, Doctor, we can't even figure out how to project you into this room. How are we supposed to create holographic ships in space?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>EMH [on monitor]:  I would humbly submit that my programme is far more sophisticated than your run of the mill hologram. In fact, projecting the illusion of a large, three-dimensional object has been a trick of magicians for centuries.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Okay, so we can't fool them for long, but maybe it'll be long enough. It's an advantage, and we'll need every advantage we can get on this mission. Work with the Doctor on it, B'Elanna. Mister Kim. Cut power to all systems to minimum requirements. I don't want to show up on any Kazon long range scanners. Mister Paris, locate the warp signature from Culluh's ship and set a course to follow, warp two.</td></tr>

We had just launched the buoy with the message for you. Then they came for her. They cut her throat as Culluh watched. He ordered them to execute me, but I bribed one of the guards to get me to a shuttle. As soon as he saw it leaving, Culluh opened fire, destroyed my life support systems.

An ARA depends on making a baseline comparison with the known response for a given species. Any Tom, Dick or Harry from the Alpha Quadrant, I could probably help you, but not with any of the new species of the Delta Quadrant.
