<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>KIM:  There. It's registering only on subspace bands. We don't even have it on long range sensors yet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Verteron emanations. Tunnelling secondary particles. It certainly looks like a wormhole.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  But is it stable enough for us to enter, and if it is, where does it lead?</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>TUVOK:  There is, of course, a seventy five percent chance the wormhole will not lead to the Alpha Quadrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Very true. But you can also say there's a one in four chance it will. Those aren't bad odds. Any analysis yet, Ensign?</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>KIM:  Too far away. We'd have to be within a thousand kilometres to get a detailed analysis. That would mean a significant course change.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Well, Mister Kim, if there's even the possibility of finding a wormhole, I think we can afford a detour. Lieutenant, input the coordinates and change course.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>PARIS:  Aye, Captain. And may I suggest, if this works, we petition the Federation Astronomical Committee to officially designate this the Harry Kim Wormhole.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>KIM:  Affirmative, Captain, and the anomaly is still registering on subspace bands.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>PARIS:  Sensors also indicate it's there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Magnify. Increase to highest magnification.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  If that's a wormhole, it must be the smallest one on record.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>KIM:  Aye Captain. It's virtually microscopic. The aperture is only about thirty centimetres in diameter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>PARIS:  I guess it's a little too small for us to fly through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>TUVOK:  However, it might be large enough to act as a conduit for a message.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>KIM:  That's right. It could carry a compressed data transmission to Federation space in minutes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  We still have to find out if it goes anywhere near the Alpha Quadrant. Can you trace it's subspace bearing?</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>KIM:  I can't get any directional readings at all. The aperture is too small.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I recommend we launch a microprobe into the wormhole.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Agreed. Do it, Lieutenant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>PARIS:  It doesn't look like any wormhole I've ever studied.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>KIM:  Microscopic gravitational eddies, extremely constricted spatial dimensions. The pathway's barely wider than the probe itself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I think what we're seeing is a wormhole in an advanced state of decay. Must be ancient. Probably been collapsing for centuries.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>PARIS:  Does that mean we can't send a message through it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>KIM:  No, I can do it. Maybe it'll take longer to get through, but the wormhole's still stable enough to carry a transmission.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Any idea yet where that message would end up, Ensign?</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>KIM:  I'll try extrapolating the verteron exit vector. No, I can't get it. There's a strange phase variance in the radiation stream. We'll have to wait until the probe exits.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  That shouldn't take long.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>KIM:  It's mired in a gravitational eddy, and because the wormhole's in a state of collapse, those eddies are incredibly dense. That probe will never break free, Captain, and we'll have no way of finding out where the wormhole ends.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>KIM:  We've analysed the data. So far our sensors have detected four separate scans of the microprobe, each one on a progressively narrower band. Someone on the other end of that wormhole is definitely interested in that probe.</td></tr>
