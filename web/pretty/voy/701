Imperfection
TEASER

LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     An alien woman stands with the former Borg
     children.

  WYSANTI
     Thank you again for taking care of them, Captain.
     We're very grateful.

  JANEWAY
     We're just glad that Rebi and Azan will have a
     chance to grow up with their own people, and that
     you've been kind enough to let Mezoti join them.

  MEZOTI
     You can still come with us.

  ICHEB
     And you can still stay on Voyager.

  MEZOTI
     Adapting to your absence will be difficult.

  ICHEB
     I'll miss you, too.

  SEVEN
     It's time.

  MEZOTI
     I've been studying all available data relevant to
     this species, as you recommended.

  SEVEN
     Familiarising yourself with their culture will
     help you adapt.

  MEZOTI
     On Wysanti, it is not customary to say goodbye
     but, I think I prefer the human way.

  ANNOTATION
     Mezoti hugs Seven, then the twins do the same.

  JANEWAY
     Energise.


LOCATION--Corridor

  SEVEN
     We should deactivate the children's alcoves.

  ICHEB
     Right now?

  SEVEN
     They're a drain on Voyager's power reserves. Is
     there a problem?

  ICHEB
     It just seems like an insufficient amount of time
     has passed.

  SEVEN
     You're having an emotional response to the
     children's departure. They'll be fine. We should
     be happy for them.

  ICHEB
     Seven?

  ANNOTATION
     He sees a tear rolling down her chin.

  SEVEN
     Yes?

  ICHEB
     You're crying.

  SEVEN
     My ocular implant must be malfunctioning.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Crying is nothing to be ashamed of, Seven. You
     should have seen me the first time I heard
     Puccini's Tosca in the holodeck. I sobbed through
     the entire third act.

  SEVEN
     You're a hologram. You can't cry.

  EMH
     Ordinarily. But Lieutenant Torres enhanced my
     emotional subroutines so I could truly appreciate
     the performance.

  SEVEN
     Then your reaction was the result of a
     technological enhancement, just as mine was the
     result of a technological malfunction.

  EMH
     Saying goodbye to the children was a traumatic
     experience. Crying was a normal response.

  SEVEN
     Except that I was in complete control of my
     emotions.

  EMH
     Hmm. It seems I owe you an apology. According to
     this, your tears were the result of a glitch in
     your primary cortical node. Have you experienced
     any other malfunctions lately? Headache?
     Dizziness? Diminished motor function?

  SEVEN
     No.

  EMH
     Really? Then you won't mind if I check the
     bio-monitors in your alcove, just to be sure?

  SEVEN
     I've experienced an occasional headache.

  EMH
     Why didn't you come to see me?

  SEVEN
     The malfunctions have not affected my work.

  EMH
     Seven, if you're having problems, you need to let
     me know.

  SEVEN
     If it'll make you feel better, I'll be more
     forthcoming in the future.

  EMH
     You're all heart. I'll schedule some follow-up
     tests and make my report to the Captain.

  SEVEN
     I'd prefer to keep this between us. I don't want
     to worry the Captain.

  EMH
     We've always kept her informed of your medical
     needs.

  SEVEN
     It was my understanding that all members of this
     crew have the right to doctor-patient
     confidentiality.

  EMH
     If you want to keep this between us, that's where
     it'll stay.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb is looking at a Starfleet Academy
     Application for Admission on the screen when he
     hears the doors open. He quickly changes the
     display.

  SEVEN
     Have you finished charting the nebula in sector
     nine four nine?

  ICHEB
     Several hours ago. I've been thinking. While I'm
     grateful for the opportunity to assist you in
     Astrometrics, I'd like to take on more challenging
     assignments.

  SEVEN
     I can assign you additional diagnostics.

  ICHEB
     That's not what I meant. I want to work on the
     bridge.

  SEVEN
     You don't have the proper training.

  ICHEB
     That's why I'd like to take the entrance exam for
     Starfleet Academy. I could forward it to Earth in
     the next datastream transmission. If I pass, I
     could take the basic classes from Commander Tuvok.
     He was an instructor at the Academy.

  SEVEN
     Your plan is ambitious.

  ICHEB
     Then you think it's a good idea? You could take
     the classes with me. Earn your own commission.

  SEVEN
     I believe I've already assimilated enough
     Starfleet training.

  ICHEB
     I'll need a letter of recommendation from the
     captain.

  SEVEN
     I'll speak to her.

  ANNOTATION
     Something moves under the skin of Seven's right
     hand. She covers it with her left.

  SEVEN
     I have work to complete in the Cargo bay. Can you
     finish here?

  ICHEB
     Of course.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  SEVEN
     Computer, initiate regeneration cycle.

  COMPUTER
     Unable to comply.

  SEVEN
     Why?

  COMPUTER
     The interface is incompatible.

  SEVEN
     Run a diagnostic of alcove zero one.

  COMPUTER
     Diagnostic complete. Alcove zero one is operating
     within normal parameters.

  SEVEN
     Initiate regeneration cycle.

  COMPUTER
     Unable to comply.

  SEVEN
     Clarify.

  COMPUTER
     Your cortical node is malfunctioning.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is drinking her third glass of nutrients in
     the starlight. Neelix enters and turns on the
     light. She winces.

  NEELIX
     Seven, I didn't see you.

  SEVEN
     I was just leaving.

  NEELIX
     Before breakfast?

  SEVEN
     What time is it?

  NEELIX
     Oh five hundred. Don't tell me you've been here
     all night.

  SEVEN
     I was unable to regenerate.

  NEELIX
     Anything on your mind?

  SEVEN
     My alcove is malfunctioning.

  NEELIX
     Well, you should ask B'Elanna to take a look at
     it.

  SEVEN
     I didn't want to wake her.

  NEELIX
     What's all this?

  SEVEN
     Nutritional supplements. I thought they would
     compensate.

  NEELIX
     Your own recipe?

  SEVEN
     It's a mixture of metabolic enzymes and protein
     extract.

  NEELIX
     Let me make you one of my Talaxian omelettes. It
     may not have as many enzymes, but it'll taste
     better.

  SEVEN
     That won't be necessary. I think I'll take your
     advice and wake Lieutenant

  ANNOTATION
     Seven collapses. Some skin peels back from her
     face to reveal metal, and she starts to convulse.

  NEELIX
     Seven! Neelix to Sickbay, medical emergency!


LOCATION--Sickbay

  JANEWAY
     You lost consciousness in the mess hall. Your
     body's begun to reject your implants.

  EMH
     I'm afraid it's a result of that glitch we found
     in your cortical node. Apparently, it's more
     serious than we thought.

  ANNOTATION
     Cortical scan 138 does not bring good news.

  SEVEN
     The node is destabilising.

  EMH
     It's no longer able to regulate your implants.
     They're shutting down one by one.

  SEVEN
     When you've disconnected implants in the past,
     I've always adapted.

  EMH
     Minor implants. An assimilation tubule here, a few
     nanoprobes there. Nothing crucial to your human
     physiology. But these implants control your vital
     functions.

  SEVEN
     And without my cortical node to regulate them,
     I'll die. Correct?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway is suddenly fascinated by her own
     fingernails.

  SEVEN
     Borg technology is highly adaptive. My cortical
     node will repair itself in time.

  EMH
     I don't think so, Seven. If anything, the
     deterioration is accelerating.

  JANEWAY
     You'll have to stay here for observation.

  SEVEN
     I think I've been sufficiently observed.

  JANEWAY
     Would you excuse us, please?

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH leaves them.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry for what's happening. You have every
     right to be angry, but that isn't going to help us
     solve this problem.

  SEVEN
     The node will correct itself.

  JANEWAY
     Suppose it doesn't, for the sake of argument. Is
     it possible to replicate a new one?

  SEVEN
     The technology is too complex.

  JANEWAY
     What if this had happened when you were part of
     the Collective? How would the Borg have repaired
     the damage?

  SEVEN
     They wouldn't have. Trying to repair a node would
     be a futile exercise. The Borg would simply
     replace it.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Harry, we passed a Borg debris field six or seven
     days ago just outside the Yontasa Expanse. See if
     you can find it on long range sensors.

  KIM
     Yes, ma'am.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's not every day we go looking for the Borg.
     What's up?

  JANEWAY
     Seven needs a new cortical node.

  TUVOK
     Captain, need I remind you the Borg often return
     to salvage damaged cubes.

  JANEWAY
     It's a risk I'm willing to take.

  CHAKOTAY
     I want to help Seven as much as anyone, but if
     we're not careful we'll all end up with cortical
     nodes.

  PARIS
     That's why I'm taking the Flyer, alone.

  KIM
     I've located the debris field.

  JANEWAY
     Transmit the coordinates to the Flyer. You have
     the bridge, Commander.

  PARIS
     With all due respect. The last time you took the
     Delta Flyer to confront the Borg, it ended up in a
     couple of thousand pieces.

  JANEWAY
     I intend to bring it back in one piece this time.

  PARIS
     A good pilot might be able to help you do that.

  TUVOK
     Particularly if he's accompanied by an experienced
     Tactical Officer.

  CHAKOTAY
     You shouldn't do this by yourself, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Well then, gentlemen, I guess you're with me.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ICHEB
     Captain.

  JANEWAY
     I'll meet you in the shuttlebay.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok and Paris go on ahead.

  ICHEB
     Have you talked to Seven?

  JANEWAY
     Just a few minutes ago.

  ICHEB
     And you don't approve?

  JANEWAY
     Of what?

  ICHEB
     My request.

  JANEWAY
     Request?

  ICHEB
     I'm sure Seven will discuss it with you when she
     has the chance. I'm sorry I bothered you.

  JANEWAY
     Obviously, no one's told you.

  ICHEB
     Told me what?

  JANEWAY
     Seven isn't well.

  ICHEB
     What's wrong with her?

  JANEWAY
     Her cortical node is failing.

  ICHEB
     Her cortical node? She's going to die.

  JANEWAY
     Not if we find a new node. We're on our way to
     search a Borg debris field.

  ICHEB
     I have experience in Borg technology. Let me come
     with you.

  JANEWAY
     I appreciate the offer, but it's too dangerous.

  ICHEB
     I'm willing to take the risk.

  JANEWAY
     I'm not willing to let you. I'll let you know how
     we did as soon as we're back. Don't worry.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is resting on a biobed.

  ICHEB
     Seven?

  SEVEN
     Why are you here?

  ICHEB
     The captain told me you were ill.

  SEVEN
     I'm fine.

  ICHEB
     Then why are you in Sickbay?

  SEVEN
     That's not your concern. You have work to
     complete. Report to Astrometrics.

  ICHEB
     I've finished my work.

  SEVEN
     Then I'll assign you more.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH comes out of his office.

  EMH
     Is there a problem?

  SEVEN
     I wish to be alone.

  EMH
     Come with me, please.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  ANNOTATION
     They walk through the office.

  ICHEB
     Why is she so angry with me?

  EMH
     She's not angry with you. She's just angry.

  ICHEB
     I don't understand.

  EMH
     It's a common response to serious illness. She's
     frustrated to be confined. Embarrassed to appear
     vulnerable.

  ICHEB
     She shouldn't be embarrassed in front of me. I'm
     her friend.

  EMH
     And her pupil. She doesn't want you or anyone else
     to see her when she's not at her best.

  ICHEB
     It's not her fault that she's sick.

  EMH
     Of course not. But we have to allow her to deal
     with this in her own way, with as much dignity as
     possible. Give her time. She may decide she wants
     company. And if she does, you're the first person
     I'll call.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer arrives at the debris field.

  TUVOK
     I have isolated a section that contains the bodies
     of approximately thirty seven drones.

  PARIS
     Thirty seven doesn't sound approximate to me.

  TUVOK
     These drones were killed in an explosion. There
     are only a few left intact.

  JANEWAY
     Looks like there's still a breathable atmosphere
     inside. Any sign of any active Borg ships in the
     vicinity?

  PARIS
     Nothing on sensors.

  JANEWAY
     That could change in a hurry. Run continuous
     scans.

  PARIS
     Yes, ma'am.


LOCATION--Borg vessel

  JANEWAY
     Tuvok, here. Help me get this off him.

  ANNOTATION
     They move a piece of metal to reveal a drone.

  JANEWAY
     No apparent damage to the cortical node.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway uses a laser scalpel to cut a hole in the
     drone's forehead above its right eye. Then she
     presses a tiny switch and the node pops up. She
     removes it with tweezers.

  PARIS [OC]
     Captain, you've got company. There's a ship

  TUVOK
     Two to beam out.

  JANEWAY
     Delta Flyer, respond.

  TUVOK
     Three humanoids have just transported aboard this
     vessel.

  JANEWAY
     Drones?

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     The only drones here are dead, and they belong to
     us. Who are you?

  JANEWAY
     Captain Kathryn Janeway of the starship Voyager.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     This is my debris field, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     We weren't aware of that.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     What have you taken?

  JANEWAY
     A cortical node. We need it to save one of my
     crew.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     Everything here belongs to us.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway quickly grabs him around the throat and
     puts her laser scalpel to his head.

  JANEWAY
     Put down your weapons and I'll consider not
     activating this laser scalpel.

  ANNOTATION
     He breaks her hold. Tuvok shoots his companions,
     but is shot himself. Janeway grabs the medkit and
     rifle just as they are beamed out. The alien's
     weapon fire goes straight through her.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer is under attack from the salvage ship.

  PARIS
     Sorry about the delay. They knocked our
     transporters offline.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway helps Tuvok into a seat. Paris flies
     deeper into the debris field, but he cannot shake
     their pursuers.

  PARIS
     I need you at tactical. When I bring us around,
     target their engine core.

  JANEWAY
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris loops around a hunk of debris and gets
     behind them. Janeway fires phasers.

  PARIS
     Nice shot. They're breaking pursuit.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The Doctor is in his office when he realises Seven
     is using a sickbay console.

  EMH
     May I ask what you're doing?

  SEVEN
     Your filing system is inefficient. I'm
     implementing a new one.

  EMH
     You should be in bed.

  NEELIX
     Delivery for Seven of Nine. Tarcanian wildflowers.
     Cheery, don't you think? Ah. If you prefer
     gladiolas, I could go back to the Airponics bay.

  EMH
     That won't be necessary, Mister Neelix. The
     flowers are lovely, aren't they, Seven?

  SEVEN
     Thank you. I'll admire them later.

  NEELIX
     Actually, I thought I'd stay and keep you company.

  EMH
     Seven prefers not to have visitors right now.

  NEELIX
     Not even a visitor with a Kadis-kot board?

  SEVEN
     Correct.

  NEELIX
     But it's your favourite game.

  EMH
     Personally I can't blame her. You're being
     extremely insensitive.

  NEELIX
     I am?

  EMH
     You know perfectly very well Seven is in a
     weakened state. She wouldn't stand a chance
     against you.

  NEELIX
     You're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
     We'll play later when you're feeling up to it.

  SEVEN
     Green.

  NEELIX
     I beg your pardon?

  SEVEN
     I prefer the green pieces. You'll use red.

  NEELIX
     Doctor, do you think she's up to it?

  EMH
     As long as you go easy on her.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Janeway to the Doctor.

  EMH
     Yes, Captain?

  JANEWAY [OC]
     We're back and we have the node.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is in the surgical bay, unconscious. She is
     covered only by a sheet. The skin over her node
     has been removed. Paris is acting as scrub nurse.

  EMH
     I'm ready to disengage the damaged node. Transfer
     Seven's cortical functions to the computer.

  JANEWAY
     Understood. Done.

  EMH
     Initiating the extraction.

  ANNOTATION
     The green light part of Seven's node is
     flickering, not a constant glow.

  JANEWAY
     Vital functions are stable.

  EMH
     Time?

  JANEWAY
     Twenty seconds.

  EMH
     Not yet, I have to realign her primary neurodes
     first.

  JANEWAY
     The computer can't maintain her cortical functions
     much longer.

  EMH
     Ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris hands him the new node.

  JANEWAY
     Her neural relays are going to destabilise in ten
     seconds, nine.

  EMH
     Almost finished.

  JANEWAY
     Eight, seven, six, five.

  ANNOTATION
     The node goes down into Seven's brain.

  EMH
     Transfer Seven's cortical functions to the new
     node.

  JANEWAY
     Something's wrong.

  PARIS
     She's going into anaphylactic shock.

  EMH
     Her implants aren't adapting. They're rejecting
     the new node.

  PARIS
     It's losing synaptic cohesion.

  EMH
     Apply a twenty millijoule neurostatic pulse on my
     mark. Now.

  JANEWAY
     No effect.

  EMH
     Again.

  JANEWAY
     Increase the pulse. Thirty millijoules.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH removes the node.

  EMH
     Computer, end simulation.


LOCATION--Holodeck

  JANEWAY
     Why did you stop?

  EMH
     It wasn't working.

  JANEWAY
     Run it again.

  PARIS
     Captain, this was our twelfth simulation.
     Something tells me thirteen won't be our lucky
     number.

  EMH
     The salvaged node has been inactive too long.

  JANEWAY
     Then we'll find one that hasn't.


LOCATION--Corridor

  EMH
     No matter how many debris fields we sift through,
     a node from a dead drone isn't going to work.

  JANEWAY
     Who said anything about a dead drone?

  EMH
     What's that supposed to mean?

  JANEWAY
     We've infiltrated Borg vessels before. If that's
     what it's going to take to save Seven, we'll do it
     again.

  EMH
     Are you suggesting ending one life to save
     another?

  JANEWAY
     I'm not giving up on her.

  EMH
     Neither am I. I'll do everything in my power to
     help her, but we both have to face the possibility
     that it may not be enough.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  NEELIX
     Red, grid thirteen three.

  SEVEN
     They should have finished the simulation by now.

  NEELIX
     I'm sure they'll let you know as soon as they do.
     Your move.

  SEVEN
     Don't you have more important duties to attend to?

  NEELIX
     Nothing that can't wait.

  SEVEN
     Despite what the Doctor told you, I feel perfectly
     fine.

  NEELIX
     Really? Because it looks to me like you're about
     to lose.

  SEVEN
     Kadis-kot.

  NEELIX
     I should have seen that coming. Ah well, that
     makes what, sixteen to three, your lead?

  SEVEN
     Sixteen to two.

  NEELIX
     Oh, my mistake.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and the EMH enter.

  NEELIX
     Oh, er, I should really see how things are going
     in the mess hall. But I'll be back later for a
     rematch.

  SEVEN
     Are you ready to proceed?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix leaves.

  JANEWAY
     According to the simulations, the salvaged node
     isn't going to work. I'm sorry.
