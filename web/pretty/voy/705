As a result, a corresponding fold will open here in the magnetic field of the red giant that Voyager is approaching. Space will be punctured at these two points, creating a gateway between the Quadrants.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Our shields are useless against geodesic radiation. We toyed with the idea of opening a fold ourselves, but it didn't take us long to realise we wouldn't survive the trip.</td></tr>
