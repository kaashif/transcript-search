TEASER

LOCATION--2404 - San Francisco - Admiral Janeway's Apartment - night

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager swoops over San Francisco and over the
     Golden Gate Bridge amid a big firework display and
     in front of a large crowd.

  NEWSREADER [OC]
     These should be familiar images to everyone who
     remembers the USS Voyager's triumphant return to
     Earth after twenty three years in the Delta
     Quadrant. Voyager captivated the hearts and minds
     of people throughout the Federation, so it seems
     fitting that on this, the tenth anniversary of
     their return, we take a moment to recall the
     sacrifices made by the crew. Corruption charges
     were brought today against a Ferengi

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway is silver-haired now. She gazes out of her
     window.


LOCATION--Admiral Janeway's Apartment - party

  ANNOTATION
     A Bolian waiter is serving drinks. People of all
     ages are mixing and greeting. A little girl taps
     the arm of a man with a lot of grey in his hair.

  KIM
     Hello.

  SABRINA
     What's your name?

  KIM
     Harry. What's yours?

  SABRINA
     Sabrina.

  KIM
     Naomi's daughter?

  SABRINA
     Ah ha.

  KIM
     You've gotten so big.

  SABRINA
     I don't remember you.

  KIM
     I haven't come to one of these reunions in four
     years.

  SABRINA
     Why?

  KIM
     I've been on a deep space assignment.

  SABRINA
     For four years?

  KIM
     Compared to how long I was on Voyager, it seemed
     like a long weekend. Can you find your mother for
     me?

  SABRINA
     Ah ha.

  KIM
     I'd like to say hi.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway lifts her arm to avoid spilling a drink as
     Sabrina runs off.

  JANEWAY
     Oops. Here you are, Captain.

  KIM
     Thank you, Admiral. I haven't seen her since she
     was a baby.

  JANEWAY
     It's amazing how fast you've all grown.

  KIM
     How's Tuvok?

  JANEWAY
     Not well.

  KIM
     I thought maybe I'd go see him tomorrow.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, that would be nice.

  KIM
     I'm sorry I missed the funeral. I should have been
     there.

  JANEWAY
     You were on a mission. Everyone understood. It's
     so good to see you, Harry.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH enters with a young lovely on his arm.

  PARIS
     Doc!

  ANNOTATION
     Paris is going bald.

  EMH
     Mister Paris. Voyager's pilot, medic, and
     occasional thorn in my side. Where have you been
     hiding yourself?

  PARIS
     I've been busy.

  EMH
     New holonovel?

  PARIS
     I'll make sure to get your input before I send it
     off to my publisher. Aren't you going to introduce
     me to your date?

  EMH
     Mister Paris meet Lana, my blushing bride.

  PARIS
     You're married?

  LANA
     Tomorrow is our two week anniversary.

  PARIS
     Well, congratulations. My invitation must have
     gotten lost in subspace..

  EMH
     Oh, you should be flattered. We took a page from
     your book and eloped.

  LANA
     Joe has a real flair for romantic gestures.

  PARIS
     Joe?

  EMH
     I decided I couldn't get married without a name.

  PARIS
     It took you thirty three years to come up with
     Joe?

  EMH
     It was Lana's grandfather's name.

  PARIS
     Oh. Oh, so you're not a

  LANA
     A hologram? No.

  EMH
     Frankly, Mister Paris, I'm surprised you'd even
     ask. I thought we were beyond those sorts of
     distinctions.

  PARIS
     Are you kidding? I think it's great. I'm in a
     mixed marriage myself, remember?

  EMH
     Speaking of which, where is that wife of yours?

  ANNOTATION
     She is talking to Janeway.

  TORRES
     The High Council had a lot of questions.

  JANEWAY
     What did you tell them?

  TORRES
     The truth, with a Klingon twist. I told them that
     my beloved former captain, who had saved my life
     many times in glorious battle, would be honoured
     to submit Korath's House for consideration.

  JANEWAY
     Do you think it will work?

  TORRES
     I'm just the Federation liaison, but I'd like to
     think I have some influence. You still haven't
     told me why you're trying to help Korath.

  JANEWAY
     He's an old friend.

  TORRES
     Would this old friend have anything to do with the
     mission that you sent my daughter on?

  JANEWAY
     Sorry, B'Elanna, but you know I can't talk about
     that.

  TORRES
     Couldn't you at least have waited until after the
     reunion? She really wanted to be here.

  JANEWAY
     She'll be home soon, I promise.

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of spoon on champagne flute.

  BARCLAY
     May I have everyone's attention, please. Ten years
     ago tonight, this crew returned home from the
     longest away mission in Starfleet's history.
     Twenty three years together made you a family, one
     I'm proud to have been adopted by. Let's raise our
     glasses to the journey.

  ALL
     To the journey.

  JANEWAY
     And to those who aren't here to celebrate it with
     us.


LOCATION--Starfleet classroom

  BARCLAY
     Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Borg.

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram of a drone appears.

  BARCLAY
     Over the course of this term, you're going to
     become intimately familiar with the Collective.
     You'll learn about the assimilation process, the
     Borg hierarchy, and the psychology of the hive
     mind. And when it comes to your performance in
     this class, my expectations are going to be no
     different than the Borg Queen herself. Perfection.
     This semester, we are very fortunate to have a
     special guest lecturer. The woman who literally
     wrote the book on the Borg. Admiral Kathryn
     Janeway.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you, Commander. I'm glad to be here. A
     question already, cadet?

  CADET
     I suppose it could wait until after class,
     Admiral.

  JANEWAY
     As they say in the Temporal Mechanics Department,
     there's no time like the present.

  CADET
     In the year 2377, you aided the Borg resistance
     movement known as Unimatrix Zero.

  BARCLAY
     Sounds like someone's been reading ahead.

  JANEWAY
     I thought you had a question, Cadet.

  CADET
     Yes, ma'am. When you informed the Queen that you
     were going to liberate thousands of her drones,
     could you describe the look on her face?

  FEMALE CADET
     Admiral? Some of us were talking before class and
     we were curious. How extensive was Seven of Nine's
     involvement with Unimatrix Zero?

  JANEWAY
     I'd, er, prefer not to discuss Seven of Nine.

  FEMALE CADET
     Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     An aide enters and whispers in Janeway's ear.

  JANEWAY
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and her aide leave.

  BARCLAY
     Okay, er, who can tell me a little about
     nanotechnology?


LOCATION--Admiral Janeway's office

  MIRAL [on monitor]
     I'm sorry to pull you out of class, Admiral.

  JANEWAY
     Did you see it?

  MIRAL [on monitor]
     Yes, ma'am.

  JANEWAY
     And?

  MIRAL [on monitor]
     It works.

  JANEWAY
     Korath has agreed to the exchange?

  MIRAL [on monitor]
     Yes.

  JANEWAY
     But?

  MIRAL [on monitor]
     He's insisting on handing it over to you
     personally.

  JANEWAY
     I'll be there as soon as I can. Good work, Ensign
     Paris.


LOCATION--Starfleet Medical - Tuvok's room

  ANNOTATION
     Candles and crumpled pieces of paper scattered all
     over the floor. The meditation lamp is also being
     used to provide illumination for his writings.
     Tuvok is left-handed.

  JANEWAY
     Hello, Tuvok.

  TUVOK
     The light.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway steps inside and the door closes. She is
     holding something fastened with a white ribbon.

  TUVOK
     I know you.

  JANEWAY
     That's right. I'm your friend, Kathryn Janeway,
     remember?

  TUVOK
     You're an impostor.

  JANEWAY
     No, Tuvok. It's me.

  TUVOK
     Admiral Janeway visits on Sunday. Today is
     Thursday. Logic dictates that you are not who you
     claim to be.

  JANEWAY
     How are you?

  TUVOK
     I am close to completing my work.

  JANEWAY
     I'm glad to hear it.

  TUVOK
     It is difficult with so many interruptions.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry. Would you like me to leave?

  TUVOK
     You may stay.

  JANEWAY
     Tuvok, there's something I need to tell you. It's
     very important. I'm going away and I may not see
     you again. Commander Barclay and the Doctor will
     continue to visit. They'll bring you anything you
     need.

  TUVOK
     The Doctor comes on Wednesdays. Commander
     Barclay's visits are erratic.

  ANNOTATION
     He returns to his writings. Janeway strokes his
     head then kisses it, and leaves her present - a
     picture of the senior staff - on his dresser. It
     is the Season 5 publicity image.

  JANEWAY
     Goodbye, Tuvok.


LOCATION--Admiral Janeway's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway opens the door to her visitor.

  JANEWAY
     You must be the only Doctor who still makes house
     calls.

  EMH
     What are your symptoms?

  JANEWAY
     I'm perfectly fine.

  EMH
     For thirty three years you fought me every time
     you were due for a physical. Now you ask me to
     give you one ahead of schedule?

  JANEWAY
     I'm taking a trip. I just wanted to get our
     appointment out of the way before I left.

  EMH
     That's all?

  JANEWAY
     That's all.

  EMH
     Hmm. The good news is you're as healthy as you
     were the first day I examined you.

  JANEWAY
     Well, now that's out of the way, have a seat. We
     didn't get to talk much at the party.

  EMH
     No, I don't suppose we did.

  JANEWAY
     So, how's married life?

  EMH
     Wonderful. You should try it.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, I think it's a little late for that. Marriage
     is for the young, like your wife.

  EMH
     I can only hope she ages as gracefully as you
     have. I, of course, will be the same handsome
     hologram twenty years from now as I am today.

  JANEWAY
     I've been meaning to ask you. Are you familiar
     with a drug called Chronexaline?

  EMH
     We've been testing it at Starfleet Medical to
     determine if it can protect biomatter from tachyon
     radiation.

  JANEWAY
     And?

  EMH
     It's very promising. Why do you ask?

  JANEWAY
     I need two thousand milligrams by tomorrow
     afternoon.

  EMH
     Why?

  JANEWAY
     That's classified. Will you get it for me?

  EMH
     Of course, Admiral. You'll have it by oh nine
     hundred.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you.

     This should be everything you need.

  JANEWAY
     The shuttle?

  BARCLAY
     Waiting for you at the Oakland shipyard. I wish
     you'd let me come with you.

  JANEWAY
     Sorry, Reg, but this is my mission. Besides, if
     you leave there won't anyone to teach those eager
     young cadets about the Borg.

  BARCLAY
     Oh. I made you some fresh tea for the trip. Not
     that replicated stuff.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you, for everything. I wouldn't have been
     able to do this without you.

  BARCLAY
     Oh, don't remind me.


LOCATION--Hillside - Chakotay's grave

  JANEWAY
     Any final words of advice for your old captain?
     Wait, don't tell me. I'm being impulsive. I
     haven't considered all the consequences. It's too
     risky. Thanks for the input, but I've got to do
     what I think is right.

  ANNOTATION
     She brushes the leaves off the simple inscription.
     Chakotay, 2329 - 2394

  JANEWAY
     I know it wasn't easy living all these years
     without her, Chakotay. But when I'm through,
     things might be better for all of us. Trust me.


LOCATION--2378 - USS Voyager - Torres-Paris' Quarters

  TORRES
     Tom. Tom?

  PARIS
     I'm sleeping.

  TORRES
     It's time.

  PARIS
     For what?

  TORRES
     I'll give you one guess.

  PARIS

  ANNOTATION
     Paris realises he doesn't have his comm. badge on.
     He grabs it from the window ledge behind the bed.

  PARIS

  EMH [OC]
     Relax, Mister Paris. Can she stand?

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is putting on a coat.

  PARIS
     Affirmative.

  EMH [OC]
     Then I suggest you report to Sickbay.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris heads for the door.

  PARIS
     What about B'Elanna?

  EMH [OC]
     Her, too.

  PARIS
     Right, of course. Maybe we should take the
     transporter. Hey, wait for me!


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Hmm.

  PARIS
     What do you mean by hmm?

  EMH
     You're going to have a very healthy baby, but not
     tonight.

  TORRES
     Tell me you're joking.

  EMH
     You're experiencing false labour, Lieutenant.

  PARIS
     Again?

  EMH
     As I explained the last time, it's a common
     occurrence, especially among Klingons.

  TORRES
     I want this thing out of me now.

  EMH
     Misdirected rage. Another common occurrence among
     Klingons.

  PARIS
     Can't you induce?

  EMH
     I wouldn't recommend it

  PARIS
     If this keeps happening, we'll never get any
     sleep.

  EMH
     You think it's bad now?


LOCATION--Ready room

  JANEWAY
     When?

  CHAKOTAY
     Oh four hundred.

  JANEWAY
     How many false alarms does that make?

  CHAKOTAY
     Three that we know of.

  JANEWAY
     That baby is as stubborn as her mother.

  CHAKOTAY
     Harry's starting a pool to see who can guess the
     actual date and time of birth.

  JANEWAY
     Tell him to put me down for next Friday, twenty
     three hundred hours. Anything else?

  CHAKOTAY
     Crewman Chell's asked about taking over in the
     mess hall full time.

  JANEWAY
     Neelix left some pretty big pots and pans to fill.
     Does Mister Chell feel he's up to the challenge?

  CHAKOTAY
     Apparently so. He's prepared a sample menu.

  JANEWAY
     Plasma leek soup? Chicken warp core don bleu?

  CHAKOTAY
     If his cooking's as bad as his puns, we're in
     trouble.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't mind giving his Red
     Alert chili a try. Feel like having lunch?

  CHAKOTAY
     I'd love to, but I've already made plans. Rain
     check?

  JANEWAY
     Absolutely.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is kneeling on a red and white checkered
     table cloth and unpacking a picnic hamper.

  CHAKOTAY
     What's all this?

  SEVEN
     A picnic. According to my research, this is an
     appropriate third date.

  CHAKOTAY
     You didn't have to go to this much trouble.

  SEVEN
     If this makes you uncomfortable I could prepare a
     less elaborate meal.

  CHAKOTAY
     No, don't change a thing. This is perfection.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb is trying his hand at Kal-toh. Kim coughs
     just before he makes a move. Icheb moves the rod
     to another place and Kim nods slightly.

  TUVOK
     In the interest of fair play, I should inform you
     that Mister Kim has never defeated me at Kal-toh.

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb places the rod at his first chosen place.
     The shape does not change.

  KIM
     You should've listened to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok's rod changes the shape.

  TUVOK
     Kal-toh is as much a game of patience as it is of
     logic. An experienced player will sometimes take
     several hours to decide his next move, and in some
     cases even days may be necessary to

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb places a rod.

  ICHEB
     Kal-toh.

  KIM
     You beat him.

  TUVOK
     Congratulations.

  ICHEB
     I'm sure it was just beginner's luck, sir. I'd
     offer you a rematch, but I'm due in Astrometrics.

  SOMEONE
     TUVOK Another time, perhaps.

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb leaves. Kim takes his place opposite Tuvok.

  KIM
     He may have to go, but I'm free and feeling lucky.

  TUVOK
     If you'll excuse me, Ensign.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok leaves the table.

  KIM
     It's just a game, Tuvok.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Icheb's an exceptionally bright young man. Did it
     occur to you that he might simply be a better
     player?

  TUVOK
     My loss was the result of another lapse in
     concentration.

  EMH
     I am detecting lower neuropeptide levels.

  TUVOK
     As I suspected. My condition is deteriorating.

  EMH
     It's a minor change. We knew it would happen. I
     simply have to increase your medication.

  TUVOK
     Thank you, Doctor.

  EMH
     Commander. I understand your desire for privacy,
     but maybe it's time we informed the captain.

  TUVOK
     I will inform her if and when the disorder begins
     to affect the performance of my duties.

  EMH
     Of course.

     A game of remote Kadis-kot is in progress.

  SEVEN
     Your move.

  SEVEN
     Red, grid three thirteen.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     Tricky.

  SEVEN
     How's Brax?

  NEELIX [on screen]
     Wonderful. Thanks for asking. I know I can never
     replace his father, but

  SEVEN
     I have no doubt the boy looks up to you.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     Orange, grid ten twelve. I haven't told anyone,
     but I'm thinking of asking Dexa to marry me.

  SEVEN
     She'd be wise to accept.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     That's enough of my love life. How about yours?

  SEVEN
     I don't have a love life.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     Oh? What about your relationship with Commander
     Chakotay?

  SEVEN
     It's your turn.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     Actually, it's yours. At least tell me how he
     liked the picnic.

  SEVEN
     It was an enjoyable activity for both of us. Thank
     you for suggesting it.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     Any time. What is it?

  SEVEN
     Long range sensors are detecting extremely high
     neutrino emissions accompanied by an intermittent
     graviton flux approximately three light years
     away.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     A wormhole?

  SEVEN
     I'm not sure. I'll need to conduct more scans.

  NEELIX [on screen]
     We can finish our game tomorrow.

  SEVEN
     I'll contact you at the usual time.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SEVEN
     The emissions are occurring at the centre of the
     nebula. There appear to be hundreds of distinct
     sources.

  KIM
     Which could translate to hundreds of wormholes.

  SEVEN
     The radiation is interfering with our sensors, but
     if Ensign Kim's enthusiasm turns out to be
     justified, it would be the most concentrated
     occurrence of wormholes ever recorded.

  JANEWAY
     Any idea where they lead?

  KIM
     Not yet, but if just one of them leads to the
     Alpha Quadrant.

  PARIS
     Who knows, Harry? It might take us right into your
     parents' living room.

  JANEWAY
     Alter course, Mister Paris. Ensign, when you speak
     to your mother, tell her we may need her to move
     the sofa.

     You did the right thing. His condition's never
     been associated with violent behaviour,

     He seems more frustrated than violent.

     Long range sensors have detected no trace. Her
     disappearance remains a mystery. I am deeply

     What are you concerned about, Tuvok?

  JANEWAY
     Her disappearance.

  EMH
     Whose?

  TUVOK
     53 31 71 53.

  PHYSICIAN
     He's been repeating those same numbers over and
     over again. 53 31 71. It might be a stardate.

  EMH
     Stardate 53317. If my memory files are accurate,
     that was the day Captain Janeway was abducted by
     the Kellidians. Is that who you're talking about,
     Tuvok? Captain Janeway?

  TUVOK
     Her disappearance remains a mystery.

  EMH
     No, you solved that mystery, Tuvok. You rescued
     the captain and brought her back to Voyager safe
     and sound. Remember?

  TUVOK
     I am deeply concerned, deeply concerned.

  PHYSICIAN
     Do you think if the Admiral paid him a visit,
     showed him that she was all right?

  EMH
     Unfortunately, she's out of town right now. I'm
     not sure when she'll be back.

  TUVOK
     She's never coming back! Her disappearance remains
     a mystery. I'm deeply concerned. Deeply concerned.

     because I need to get in touch with Admiral
     Janeway.

     Oh, she's out of town.

     I know. Did she tell you where she was going?

     Er, I'm afraid it, it never came up. I mean, is
     something wrong?

     morning. He seemed to think that she was in some
     sort of danger.

     Well, you know better than anyone how confused
     Tuvok can get.

  EMH
     Yes, but I've been worried about the admiral, too.

  BARCLAY
     Why?

  EMH
     Two days ago, she asked me for a large quantity of
     an experimental medication. When I asked her why
     she needed it, she said it was classified.

  BARCLAY
     Then you shouldn't be telling me about it, should
     you?

  EMH
     I spoke to Director Okaro at Starfleet
     Intelligence. He assured me that the admiral
     hasn't been involved in any classified work since
     she began teaching at the Academy.

  BARCLAY
     You know how sneaky these Intelligence people can
     be. Maybe he was just trying to throw you off.

  EMH
     Maybe. But still. She's been talking for months
     about how excited she is to be teaching with you.
     Then, just as the semester begins, she goes away
     without even telling you where. Don't you find
     that a little strange?

  BARCLAY
     I, I'm sure that there is a perfectly reasonable
     explanation, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have some
     p-papers to grade.

  EMH
     You're stammering, Reg.

  BARCLAY
     S-s-so?

  EMH
     I haven't heard you do that in years. I think you
     do know where she is.

  BARCLAY
     She is one of the most decorated officers in all
     of Starfleet history, and I'm, I'm sure she can
     take care of herself.

  EMH
     You wouldn't be saying that unless she was doing
     something dangerous.

  BARCLAY
     You are putting words in my mouth.

  EMH
     Tell me where she is, Reg.


LOCATION--Cavern

  ANNOTATION
     Admiral Janeway beams in.

  MIRAL
     Welcome to the House of Korath, Admiral.

  JANEWAY
     I love what he's done with the place.

  KLINGON
     Kuva'kor li'ju!Q mah. (perhaps.)

  MIRAL
     PetaQ! DabeQ chu'magh an'noQ. (I think)

  JANEWAY
     What was that about?

  MIRAL
     He said your demeanour was disrespectful.

  JANEWAY
     I hope you told him I didn't mean to be rude.

  MIRAL
     I told him if he didn't show you more respect, I
     would break his arm.

  JANEWAY
     You are your mother's daughter.

  MIRAL
     Korath is waiting. We should go in.

  JANEWAY
     Sorry, but this is where we part ways.

  MIRAL
     Excuse me?

  JANEWAY
     You're dismissed, Ensign.

  MIRAL
     But, Admiral, I really think that

  JANEWAY
     I can take care of myself.

  MIRAL
     With all due respect, I've been working on this
     for six months, and

  JANEWAY
     And you've done an exemplary job. But it's over.
     Understood?

  MIRAL
     Yes, ma'am.

  JANEWAY
     I happen to know your parents are anxious to spend
     some time with you. Take a few days leave. Go and
     see them.


LOCATION--Laboratory

  ANNOTATION
     Korath is working on a weapon when Janeway is
     escorted in.

  KORATH
     A Cardassian disruptor. I've modified it to emit a
     nadion pulse.

  JANEWAY
     Impressive, but that's not what I've come for.

  KORATH
     No. You've come for something far more dangerous.

  JANEWAY
     Where is it?

  KORATH
     Somewhere safe.

  JANEWAY
     I went to a great deal of trouble to get you your
     seat on the High Council. Now give me what you
     promised.

  KORATH
     I've scanned your shuttle. It appears that you've
     made some interesting modifications. Your shield
     generator is of particular interest.

  JANEWAY
     It's not for sale.

  KORATH
     Then what you want isn't available either.

  JANEWAY
     We had an agreement.

  KORATH
     Show the admiral out.


LOCATION--2378 - Bridge

  PARIS
     Maybe Chell should add Nebula Soup to his menu.

  JANEWAY
     Shields?

  TUVOK
     Holding.

  JANEWAY
     Bridge to Astrometrics.

  SEVEN [OC]
     Go ahead.

  JANEWAY
     Any more data on those neutrino emissions?


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  SEVEN
     Negative, Captain. I still can't get a clear scan.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Distance to the centre?

  SEVEN
     Six million kilometres.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     What is it?

  TUVOK
     I'm detecting a tritanium signature, bearing three
     four two, mark five five.

  PARIS
     Whatever it is, it's too close.

  JANEWAY
     Evasive manoeuvres.

  CHAKOTAY
     Is it a ship?

  TUVOK
     Possibly.

  KIM
     Another tritanium signature, right on top of us.

  ANNOTATION
     A Borg Cube looms out of the fog.

  JANEWAY
     Tom!

  ANNOTATION
     They duck underneath it.

  JANEWAY
     Get us out of here now.


LOCATION--Borg Queen's chamber

  BORG [OC]
     Vessel identified: USS Voyager. We will pursue and
     assimilate.

  QUEEN
     No. They haven't compromised our security. Let the
     vessel continue, for now. I'll keep an eye on
     them.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  ANNOTATION
     Course projection grid 641.

  TUVOK
     There's no evidence that the Cube detected us.

  CHAKOTAY
     Where is it now?

  SEVEN
     Approximately three light years away.

  PARIS
     How could they not have seen us? We came within
     ten metres of their hull.

  TUVOK
     The Borg wouldn't knowingly risk a collision. The
     radiation must have interfered with their sensors
     as well.

  KIM
     If they can't detect us, we should go back.

  SEVEN
     I wouldn't recommend it. My analysis of the
     tritanium signature suggests there were at least
     forty seven Borg vessels inside the nebula.

  KIM
     We can't just give up on those wormholes.

  JANEWAY
     Oh yes, we can.

  KIM
     What if we try to modify

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry, Mister Kim. You may be the captain
     someday, but not today.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Back in normal empty space.

  KIM
     Tom, what are you doing when your shift ends?

  PARIS
     No plans. Why?

  KIM
     I've been thinking. You and I should have some
     fun. One last adventure before you get too busy
     being a father.

  PARIS
     Did you reserve some holodeck time?

  KIM
     I've got a better idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim hands him a PADD.

  PARIS
     This is your idea of fun?

  KIM
     It'll work. We just need to make a few
     modifications to the Flyer.
