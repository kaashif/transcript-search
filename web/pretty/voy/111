Heroes and Demons
TEASER

LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     Containment field is active. We're ready for
     transport.

  JANEWAY
     Energise.

  ANNOTATION
     Glowing orange gas fills a container.

  TORRES
     That's strange. Both containers should have been
     filled.

  JANEWAY
     Here's the problem. A slight breach in the annular
     confinement beam.

  TORRES
     I'm aborting transport. Okay, let's try that
     again. Energising.

  ANNOTATION
     Both containers fill this time.

  TORRES
     All right. I'll get a complete phase spectrum
     analysis on this as soon as possible.

  JANEWAY
     If this photonic matter works as well as I think,
     it could boost the efficiency of our power
     converters fifteen percent.

  TORRES
     I'd say more like twenty.

  JANEWAY
     How long will it take to finish the preliminary
     analysis?

  TORRES
     Um, six hours. Maybe more.

  JANEWAY
     I'd like to get it sooner than that. I believe
     Ensign Kim is off duty. Could you use his help?

  TORRES
     Can you convince him to give up his free time?

  JANEWAY
     I think I might be able to. Janeway to Kim. That's
     odd. Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

  COMPUTER
     Unable to comply. Ensign Kim is not aboard the
     ship.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUVOK
     Sensor logs show no record of any unauthorised
     transporter activity and all shuttlecraft are
     accounted for. If Ensign Kim left the ship, he did
     not do so by conventional means.

  CHAKOTAY
     His last shift ended four hours ago, and he was
     scheduled for time on holodeck two when he went
     off duty. No one has seen him since.

  JANEWAY
     Scan the holodeck. What's the matter?

  TUVOK
     There is significant interference in the holodeck.
     I cannot obtain a clear scan.

  JANEWAY
     Is it a system malfunction?

  TUVOK
     I do not believe so.

  JANEWAY
     Commander.


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck two

  TUVOK
     The holodeck is definitely active. There appears
     to be a programme in progress.

  CHAKOTAY
     Can you shut it down?

  TUVOK
     Manual overrides are not functioning. I cannot
     terminate the programme.

  CHAKOTAY
     All right, let's go in.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Forest

  ANNOTATION
     Night time. Frogs are calling.

  CHAKOTAY
     Computer, identify programme.

  COMPUTER
     The programme in progress is a holonovel based on
     the epic Earth poem Beowulf.

  TUVOK
     Beowulf?

  CHAKOTAY
     An ancient English epic, set in sixth century
     Denmark, if I remember correctly. It's about a
     hero named Beowulf who fights a creature that's
     terrorising a kingdom and murdering its subjects.
     Monsters and swordplay. That sort of thing.

  TUVOK
     I'm not detecting any life signs but there's still
     considerable interference.

  CHAKOTAY
     I can't determine the source.

  ANNOTATION
     A spear flies past and stick into a tree.

  FREYA
     Speak as a friend or stand challenged.

  TUVOK
     Computer, delete character.

  CHAKOTAY
     The holodeck command systems must not be
     functioning either.

  TUVOK
     We must also consider the possibility that the
     safety programmes are malfunctioning as well.

  FREYA
     I am Freya, shield maiden, daughter of King
     Hrothgar. I hold this guard post against any
     intruders who would bear us harm, so declare
     yourselves. I will hear your answer before you
     march any further through this land.

  TUVOK
     We have no desire to trespass. However, we are on
     an urgent mission, so if you would allow us to
     continue, we would appreciate it.

  FREYA
     What land do you call home? Your faces tell me you
     are not men of the Danes. Are you kinsmen of
     Beowulf?

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes. We are Beowulf's kinsmen. My name is Chakotay
     and this is Tuvok. Have you seen Beowulf?

  FREYA
     Yes. He was like no other. Hair straight and raven
     black. Eyes bright with fierce fire. The burning
     gaze of a hero.

  TUVOK
     Grandiloquence notwithstanding, that would qualify
     as a description of Mister Kim. How did you know
     he was Beowulf?

  CHAKOTAY
     This is Harry's holonovel. It'd make sense that
     he'd be playing the hero. She might be able to
     help us figure out what happened to him.

  TUVOK
     A reasonable assumption.

  FREYA
     Your kinsman was a truly noble warrior. It is
     right you should avenge his death.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes. But first we'd like to know more about how
     Beowulf died.

  FREYA
     Of course. Come. I will take you to the king.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Great Hall

  ANNOTATION
     The evening feast is in progress.

  FREYA
     Hail, Lord Hrothgar! I bring new friends, Chakotay
     and Tuvok, kinsmen of Beowulf who come to avenge
     his death. Greet them well.

  HROTHGAR
     I would bid you welcome to my hall, but the days
     of glad tidings are gone from this place. We
     grieve with you for your kinsman. We had hoped
     that a warrior of Beowulf 's strength and renown
     would be able to deliver us from our curse.

  ANNOTATION
     Hrothgar is helped to his throne by Unferth.

  CHAKOTAY
     Could you tell us exactly what happened to him?

  UNFERTH
     He met with the same fate as did thirty of our own
     warriors.

  HROTHGAR
     It's true. Grendel.

  CHAKOTAY
     That's the monster who's been attacking you.

  HROTHGAR
     Repelled by light and laughter, the beast waits
     until we slumber. Then bereft of remorse, Grendel
     comes in murderous rage to my hall to take my
     people, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop
     it. If you are wise, you will forego your
     vengeance and return home. Death lives here now.

  UNFERTH
     My lord is fatigued. It is time to retire.

  TUVOK
     We would like more information about Beowulf.
     Would it be possible to examine his body?

  FREYA
     The body of Beowulf is gone, dragged down to
     Grendel's foul lair, no doubt. The beast leaves no
     traces.

  CHAKOTAY
     Did anyone actually see the battle?

  FREYA
     No. Beowulf chose to face Grendel alone.

  CHAKOTAY
     Then I think we'd like to see this Grendel for
     ourselves.

  UNFERTH
     To what purpose? To raise false hopes in our king
     again, as did your kinsman? Leave us alone in our
     misery.

  FREYA
     Unferth, these men are our guests. You will show
     them the hospitality they deserve.

  UNFERTH
     They deserve nothing! If their Beowulf was truly
     the champion he claimed to be, then Grendel would
     be dead, his head mounted on a spear! Instead, we
     spend yet another night in terror.

  TUVOK
     If you would allow us to assist you, perhaps we
     could help alleviate your terror.

  UNFERTH
     Your names mean nothing to me. There are no songs
     of your deeds nor stories of the battles you have
     fought. Who are you to believe you can slay
     Grendel?

  TUVOK
     We have no intention of slaying anyone. We simply
     wish to examine the creature.

  UNFERTH
     Grendel might not wish to be examined without a
     fight. And if you would fight Grendel, then you
     will first prove your worth to me. Defend
     yourselves!

  ANNOTATION
     Hrothgar puts his hand on Unferth's sword.

  HROTHGAR
     You are able warriors. You may stand sentry
     tonight.

  ANNOTATION
     The Danes leave.

  FREYA
     You are brave men. I hope to see you again, fate
     permitting.

  ANNOTATION
     Freya leaves.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to Janeway.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Paris and Torres are at the rear science stations.

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Captain, we haven't found any definite signs of
     Harry, but we've encountered several holodeck
     characters who claim to know what happened to him.

  TUVOK [OC]
     Mister Kim was running a holonovel based on the
     poem Beowulf. According to the holo characters, he
     attempted to battle a creature of some kind and
     was killed in the process.

  JANEWAY
     Killed?

  TUVOK [OC]
     Since the


LOCATION--Holodeck - Great Hall

  TUVOK
     Safety programs are malfunctioning, we must
     consider the possibility.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     But you haven't found a body.

  CHAKOTAY
     No. If we shut down the programme, we'd know if
     he's here or not.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Run a diagnostic on the holodeck's imaging control
     systems. If they're not working, try to repair
     them. And relay your tricorder scans to the
     Bridge. I'd like to analyse your readings.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Aye, Captain. Chakotay out.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Great Hall

  TUVOK
     Primary imaging matrix should be here behind this
     wooden panel. I will attempt to locate the
     auxiliary matrix. This ancient Earth culture seems
     fascinated with monsters.

  CHAKOTAY
     Every culture has its demons. They embody the
     darkest emotions of its people. Giving them
     physical form in heroic literature is a way of
     exploring those feelings. The Vok'sha of Rakella
     Prime believe that hate is a beast which lives
     inside the stomach. Their greatest mythical hero
     is a man who ate stones for twenty three days to
     kill the beast and became a saint.

  TUVOK
     Such fables are necessary only in cultures which
     unduly emphasise emotional behaviour. I would
     point out there are no demons in Vulcan
     literature.

  CHAKOTAY
     That might account for its popularity.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Bridge to Chakotay.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay here.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Commander


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     We've analysed your tricorder data. A deep-level
     scan shows minute quantities of photonic energy.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     How could it be in the holodeck?

  TORRES
     We think it happened when we beamed aboard the
     samples from the protostar. There was a breach in
     the annular confinement beam, and photonic energy
     must have leaked into the transporter system.

  JANEWAY
     And from there into other ship systems as well.
     We've already found some in the replicators.

  TUVOK [OC]
     That raises an uncomfortable possibility, Captain.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Great Hall

  TUVOK
     If the holodeck's conversion nodes were
     contaminated, Ensign Kim may have inadvertently
     undergone the process of matter conversion.

  CHAKOTAY
     You're saying he might have been converted into
     energy?


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     We have to consider it a possibility. After all,
     the holodeck are basically an outgrowth of
     transporter technology, changing energy into
     matter and back again every time a programme is
     run.

  TORRES
     Except it's not supposed to convert people.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Hold on, Captain.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Great Hall

  CHAKOTAY
     Something's coming.

  TUVOK
     It is an object approximately one metre in
     diameter.

  CHAKOTAY
     I think Grendel may be paying us a visit.

  TUVOK
     Captain, the holo-characters told us Kim was
     killed by Grendel. An examination of this part of
     the programme might be advisable.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Proceed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES
     Captain, I'm picking up signs of matter energy
     conversion.

  JANEWAY
     Emergency transport. Get them out of there now.

  TORRES
     I can't get a lock.

  ANNOTATION
     A bright light forces open the door to the Great
     Hall.

  JANEWAY
     Commander Chakotay, report. Mister Tuvok.

  TORRES
     Captain, I've lost their life signs. They're gone.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  TORRES
     This is a scan of the holodeck just before we lost
     contact with Chakotay and Tuvok. The readings are
     pretty garbled, but I'm still inclined to think
     there is a malfunction in the holodeck's matter
     conversion nodes.

  JANEWAY
     Photonic energy leaking into the subsystems could
     certainly damage the nodes, and it might have
     created a defect in the programme that occurs when
     Grendel shows up.

  TORRES
     A defect that dematerialised our people.
