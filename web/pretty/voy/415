<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Impressive.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>KOVIN:  I'm glad you agree. It's not wise to travel this region without adequate defences. I've seen scuttled ships with more firepower than Voyager.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>KOVIN:  Imagine what you'll be capable of once the isokinetic cannon is integrated into your defensive systems. One projectile can penetrate the shields of any heavily armoured vessel. Hostile species will know to avoid Voyager by reputation alone.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  You've made your point, Mister Kovin. I want the cannon, and I'm prepared to give you astrometrics charts spanning twelve sectors. You'll find them unusually precise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>KOVIN:  Even the most sophisticated charts become obsolete. One random anomaly and they're no longer accurate. However, I could be persuaded if you were to include the mapping technology that created them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Sorry. Our Astrometrics sensors were designed specifically for this ship. They'd be of no use to you. What I can offer you is a generous supply of isolinear processing chips. We'll even show you how to integrate them into your existing sensor technology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>KOVIN:  How generous a supply?</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  Maybe so, but you seem to work well with him. You've been asking for more responsibilities, I thought you'd be pleased.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>KOVIN:  No, no! The subroutines need to be arranged in cascading sequence. Let me show you. (Kovin pushes Seven aside, so she knocks him down. Kovin's security guard grabs Seven, then Torres joins in.)</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>TORRES:  Oh, I wouldn't put it like that. I was at another console about ten metres away. I heard Kovin raise his voice and when I looked around I saw that he was holding her arm.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I suppose I am. Because frankly I'm running out of options. Throwing you in the brig isn't going to solve anything, neither is slapping you on the wrist. And it's not as though I don't understand your feelings about Kovin. There have been a few times when I'd have liked to pop him on the nose myself. But you have to start learning the difference between having an impulse and acting on it. Does that make any sense to you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>EMH:  I understand the burden you carry. Constantly being obligated to deal with those who fall short of excellence. I often find my own patience being tested by someone like Mister Kovin. Of course I generally respond with a devastating quip rather than a left hook. We must both accept the fact that very few lifeforms will ever meet our high standards. So, when you get irritated, just try to be tolerant, and remember, they can't help being what they are. Hmm. I'm reading some increased engrammatic activity, and your adrenalin levels are slightly elevated.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>SEVEN:  What does that indicate?</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>EMH:  It's consistent with a state of heightened tension. Lie down and I'll run some scans. In a typical human, I would consider this a mood swing. But with your unique physiology, I'd like to rule out the possibility of a chemical imbalance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Seven lies down and the curved arms close over her. She has a flashback to a more frightening similar situation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>EMH:  I don't think so. I think the problem has to do with memory suppression. I've detected a high concentration of biogenic amines in Seven's hippocampus, a substance I haven't noticed before. It's blocking portions of her memory centre.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>EMH:  A Jungian therapist would attempt to retrieve unconscious memories by exploring synchronicities in recent events. On the other hand, Amanin of Betazed would argue that a combination of sensory isolation and focused breathing techniques would be more effective. I've integrated the finer points of both to create my own approach to memory reconstruction.</td></tr>
