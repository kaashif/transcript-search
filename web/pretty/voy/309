That is, I, I'd expressed my desire to learn the ropes as it were, and I have completed my study of starship security protocols.

I've tried to find some other area where I might be useful, but, the truth is, I'm not needed. I'm hoping you can help me. I can't let Voyager go into that dangerous without some idea of what's there. I have to find a map.</td></tr>
