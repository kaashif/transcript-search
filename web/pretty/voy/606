<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Okay, here goes. A lone Ensign finds himself stranded on a class L planetoid with no rations. His only possession, a calendar. When Starfleet finds him twelve months later, he's in perfect health. Why didn't he starve to death?</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>TUVOK:  It is a theoretical possibility that such planetoids contain hot water springs, which could sustain the man for several weeks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>TUVOK:  I concur. Logic dictates that the Ensign in question would perish.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Ah ha, ha ha! I stumped you. As a matter of fact, he not only survived, but his belly was full. Why? Because he feasted on dates from the calendar.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Your answer is merely wordplay, it has no basis in reality. Now, if you'll excuse me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>NAROQ:  I believe I can. Based on the information you provided, it is my opinion that he was a victim of the Ba'Neth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I've never heard of them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>NAROQ:  I'm not surprised. In my language, their name means shadow people. They're a species obsessed with concealing their identity. Extremely paranoid and xenophobic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Well, that explains their cloaking technology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>NAROQ:  It's my belief they've been responsible for several unexplained attacks similar to this one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Why wasn't I warned about them during my negotiations with your government?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>NAROQ:  Because my government's official position is that the Ba'Neth do not exist. Most people think they're a myth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  There's nothing mythical about what happened to Mister Tuvok. Why is your government so sceptical?</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>NAROQ:  Because there've been so few encounters with the Ba'Neth and, well, no one's ever actually seen one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  How many encounters are we talking about, exactly?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>NAROQ:  Before this incident? Twelve.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>CHAKOTAY:  I guess we're lucky thirteen.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>NAROQ:  You're lucky I gave my supervisor two bottles of Kesatian ale to get this assignment. Any other inspector would have simply attributed Commander Tuvok's injuries to unexplained phenomenon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  No offence, Mister Naroq, but what makes you so sure the Ba'Neth aren't just a myth?</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>NAROQ:  This incident fits the pattern, Captain. All of the alleged encounters have occurred aboard vessels foreign to this sector. I believe they've been attempts by the Ba'Neth to assess the technology of new arrivals.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>NEELIX:  They were trying to download tactical data.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>NAROQ:  And Commander Tuvok suffered severe neural damage. That's also consistent with previous attacks. The Ba'Neth were making sure he would not tell anyone what he saw.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Maybe that's why Tuvok's tricorder was destroyed. They didn't want us to see the cloaking frequency he'd found.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>NAROQ:  He found a cloaking frequency?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Apparently.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>NAROQ:  Captain, I don't blame you for finding my theories a bit eccentric. I'm used to it. It's why I'm still a deputy investigator, but I've brought equipment to help your investigation. Let me examine Commander Tuvok and run scans on the vessel where he was attacked. I may finally be able to prove my theories.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  With all due respect, we're more interested in saving Tuvok's life.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>NAROQ:  If we work together, maybe we can do both.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>NAROQ:  But he still has brain activity, which is more than I can say for any of the previous victims.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>EMH:  Vulcan neural tissue is extremely resilient. I have no doubt that a brain from a lesser species would not have survived.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>NAROQ:  If you could only tell us what you saw, Mister Tuvok.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>EMH:  I don't think we'll be hearing from him any time soon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Keep working. I'll let you know if we find anything that might help. I'll take you to see where the attack occurred.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Janeway and Naroq leave.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>EMH:  Something I can do for you, Mister Neelix?</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>NEELIX:  I want to help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>EMH:  Unless you have a degree in Vulcan neurobiology that I'm not aware of, there's nothing you can do.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>NEELIX:  There must be something.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>EMH:  My advice is to return to your quarters and get some rest.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>NEELIX:  There's no way that I'm going to be able to sleep knowing that Tuvok is lying here like this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>EMH:  There have been rare cases in which comatose patients responded to external stimuli. Aromas, touch, voices.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>NEELIX:  So, you're saying that if I stay here and, and try to talk to Tuvok, I might be able to provoke some sort of response?</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>EMH:  If anyone can provoke Tuvok, Mister Neelix, it's you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Later, Neelix is wheeling a trolley full of Tuvok's possessions into Sickbay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Good morning, Tuvok. I brought you a few more items from your quarters to help liven up Sickbay. Your kal-toh game, in case you decide you're ready for a match. Oh, and I also thought that you might enjoy a recitation of that classic proto-Vulcan drama, Clash on the Fire Plains. I'll be performing all twenty three parts myself. I also brought you some flowers from the Airponics bay. Oh, that's fragrant, isn't it? Perhaps you'd enjoy some Vulcan incense. How about some music? Computer, access Vulcan audio file, selection fifty six alpha.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>EMH:  Mister Neelix. What is that dreadful noise?</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>NEELIX:  The Chants of the Monks of T'Panit. Personally, I think it's dreadful, too, but it's one of Tuvok's favourites.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>EMH:  I appreciate your efforts, Mister Neelix, but I'm trying to analyse his latest neurological scans and this music is very distracting.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>NEELIX:  You said I was supposed to stimulate his senses.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>EMH:  I said stimulate them, Mister Neelix, not annihilate them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Computer, pause music.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>NEELIX:  Don't worry, Tuvok, he's only trying to help you. It's only a tricorder. See? It won't hurt you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L121"><td><a href="#L121">121</a></td><td>NAROQ:  The sound of history being made.</td></tr>

<tr id="L123"><td><a href="#L123">123</a></td><td>NAROQ:  The sound you're hearing indicates the presence of veridium isotopes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L124"><td><a href="#L124">124</a></td><td>SEVEN:  Residual particles from the Ba'Neth's cloaking field.</td></tr>

<tr id="L125"><td><a href="#L125">125</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  You've detected these isotopes before?</td></tr>

<tr id="L126"><td><a href="#L126">126</a></td><td>NAROQ:  Yes, but only after they've decayed. You see, veridium has a very brief half-life, less than seventy hours. The previous sites I've studied have been months, sometimes years old.</td></tr>

<tr id="L127"><td><a href="#L127">127</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  But these isotopes are still active.</td></tr>

<tr id="L131"><td><a href="#L131">131</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The converter flashes, and a shape starts to form.</td></tr>

<tr id="L133"><td><a href="#L133">133</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  So the Ba'Neth aren't a myth after all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L134"><td><a href="#L134">134</a></td><td>NAROQ:  This is the clearest image ever captured.</td></tr>

<tr id="L135"><td><a href="#L135">135</a></td><td>SEVEN:  Perhaps. I believe I can adjust our internal sensors to improve it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L136"><td><a href="#L136">136</a></td><td>NAROQ:  What are you doing? You might disrupt the image entirely. Tentacles. I always suspected they were multipeds!</td></tr>

<tr id="L138"><td><a href="#L138">138</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  I'm on my way. Seven, if we can integrate Mister Naroq's photolytic technology into the deflector array, we might be able to decloak a Ba'Neth ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L139"><td><a href="#L139">139</a></td><td>NAROQ:  The technology only works at close range. We have to find the ship before we can expose it. We still need that cloaking frequency.</td></tr>

They're forming new synaptic connections. In effect, his brain is rewiring itself. Whether this is due to my neurostatic therapy, or Neelix's rehabilitation regimen, or some combination of the two I can't be certain.</td></tr>
