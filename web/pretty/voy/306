<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>TUVOK:  Your inarticulate expression of awe notwithstanding, Mister Neelix, it was a fascinating spectacle.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>KIM:  That's the edge of the shock wave. The pressure's over ninety kilopascals, thirty percent more than we predicted.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Tom, back us off at full impulse. I want to stay ahead of the brunt of that wave.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  Congratulations, everyone. Only two other crews in the history of Starfleet have witnessed a supernova explosion.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>KIM:  But neither one was this close. Less than ten billion kilometres. Definitely a record.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>EMH:  Just remember, Kes, anyone can stargaze on the Bridge, even a hologram with a mobile emitter, but the real action will always be in sickbay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>Q:  Now I see. You think I'm interested in some tawdry one night stand. That's because I haven't told you why I'm here yet. Out of all the females of all the species in all the galaxies, I have chosen you to be the mother of my child.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>Q:  It's an overwhelming honour, isn't it? I can't get you out of my mind. You're confident, passionate, beautiful.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>JANEWAY:  And totally uninterested.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>Q:  Kathy, you can't leave. My cosmic clock is ticking. Besides, you have no idea what you're missing. Foreplay with a Q can last for decades.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>Q:  Guys, I just don't understand your Captain. I've tried everything. Filling the Bridge with roses, writing Drabian love sonnets, serenading her in her bath.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>Q:  I just thought that the two of you might be able to give me some advice on how to break through Kathy's icy exterior. You know, man to man.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>PARIS:  My advice would be to give up before you embarrass yourself anymore than you already have. Come on, Harry. We're not going to get a straight answer out of this guy.</td></tr>

It was fun at first, gallivanting around the galaxy, using my omnipotence to impress females of every species. The fact of the matter is, it left me empty. I want someone to love me for myself. I guess what I'm saying is, I want a relationship. I just thought if you and I had a child, it would give me that kind of stability and security that I've been missing.</td></tr>
