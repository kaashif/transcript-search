The Omega Glory
TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Approaching planet Omega Four, sir. Object ahead.
     Another vessel in planet orbit, Captain.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, sound alert.

  UHURA
     Aye, sir. All decks report ready, sir.

  KIRK
     Long range sensor scan, Mister Sulu.

  SULU
     It's the USS Exeter, sir.

  KIRK
     Try to contact her, Lieutenant.

  UHURA
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     The Exeter. she was patrolling in this area six
     months ago. I hadn't heard of any trouble.

  UHURA
     Receiving no response to our signal, sir.

  SULU
     The sensors indicate no damage to the vessel,
     Captain.

  KIRK
     I see. Magnification factor three, Mister Sulu.

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen shows a sister ship to the
     Enterprise orbiting the purple planet.

  KIRK
     Hold our position out here, Mister Sulu.
     Lieutenant, have Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, and
     Lieutenant Galloway report to the transporter
     room. We'll board and investigate.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SPOCK
     We're locked onto the Exeter's engineering
     section, Captain.

  KIRK
     Phasers on heavy stun. Energise.


LOCATION--Exeter Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     It's dark and quiet.

  SPOCK
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a red jacket draped across a console, with
     white crystals scattered in and around it.

  KIRK
     Just their uniforms left.

  SPOCK
     As if they were in them when

  KIRK
     Exactly. When what?

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy scans the white crystals.

  KIRK
     This is Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Is
     anyone on board? If there is, and you can hear me,
     please respond by intercom to the engineering
     section. Is there anyone on board?

  SPOCK [OC]
     Spock here, Captain.


LOCATION--Corridor

  SPOCK
     Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out the
     lower levels. There seems to be no one aboard.
     Only uniforms.


LOCATION--Exeter Engineering

  KIRK
     What about the shuttlecraft?

  GALLOWAY [OC]
     Galloway on the hangar deck, sir. All four of the
     craft are still here. If they left, they didn't
     leave that way.

  KIRK
     Doctor McCoy and I are going to the Bridge. Meet
     us there.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log. Aboard the USS Exeter commanded by
     Ron Tracey, one of the most experienced captains
     in the Starfleet. What could have happened to him
     and the over four hundred men and women who were
     on this ship?


LOCATION--Exeter Bridge

  GALLOWAY
     The helm was left on automatic, sir.

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  KIRK
     Spock, play the last log tape. Maybe they had time
     to record what happened to them.

  SPOCK
     Aye, sir.

  MCCOY
     Jim, the analysis of this so far is potassium
     thirty five percent, carbon eighteen percent,
     phosphorous one point zero, calcium one point
     five. Jim, the crew didn't leave. They're still
     here.

  KIRK
     What do you mean?

  MCCOY
     These white crystals. That's what's left of the
     human body when you take the water away, which
     makes up ninety six percent of our bodies. Without
     water, we're all just three or four pounds of
     chemicals. Something crystallised them down to
     this.

  SPOCK
     I have their surgeon's log, Captain. Their last
     log entry, Captain, on screen.

  ANNOTATION
     A man in a blue shirt is struggling to try and sit
     up in the Captains chair and dictate the log.

  DOCTOR [on viewscreen]
     If you've come aboard this ship, you're dead men.
     Don't go back to your own ship. You have one
     chance. Get down there. Get down there fast.
     Captain Tracey is (screams and falls out of view.)

  KIRK
     Prepare to beam down to the planet surface fast.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns and looks down at the blue uniform lying
     on the floor where they saw the doctor fall.


LOCATION--Village

  ANNOTATION
     The four beam into a place with wooden
     construction, fabric hangings on walls, and a
     beheading about to take place in the main square.
     It takes three villagers to try and restrain the
     big man they want to kill, and two to hold the
     woman who will follow him. Then someone sees the
     new arrivals.

  VOICE
     Oi! O1!

  TRACEY
     Put the axe away, Liyang.

  KIRK
     That's Ron Tracey. Ron.

  TRACEY
     I knew someone would come looking for us. I'm just
     sorry it had to be you, Jim. I'm glad your arrival
     stopped this. No more of this, Wu. Lock up the
     savages.

  WU
     They carry fire boxes.

  TRACEY
     I said lock up the savages. The prisoners are
     called Yangs. Impossible even to communicate with.
     Hordes of them out there. They'll attack anything
     that moves.

  SPOCK
     Interesting that the villagers know about phasers.

  KIRK
     You were left alone down here, Ron. What happened?

  TRACEY
     Our medi-scanners revealed this planet as
     perfectly harmless. The villagers, the Kohms here,
     were friendly enough once they got over the shock
     of my white skin. As you've seen, we resemble the
     Yangs, the savages. My landing party transported
     back to the ship. I stayed down here to arrange
     for the planet survey with the village elders. The
     next thing I knew, the ship was calling me. The
     landing party had taken an unknown disease back.
     My crew, Jim. My entire crew. Gone.

  KIRK
     Yes, I know. We saw it.

  TRACEY
     And I'm just as infected as they were. As you are.
     But I stayed alive because I stayed down here.
     There's some natural immunisation that protects
     everyone on the planet surface. I don't know what
     it is.
