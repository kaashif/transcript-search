You would never have been frightened by me. And I thought my distress signal quite clever. It was a pleasure testing you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L352"><td><a href="#L352">352</a></td><td>BALOK:  I have no crew, Doctor. I run everything, this entire complex, from this small ship. But I miss company, conversation. Even an alien would be welcome. Perhaps one of your men for some period of time. An exchange of information, cultures.</td></tr>

<tr id="L353"><td><a href="#L353">353</a></td><td>KIRK:  Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?</td></tr>
