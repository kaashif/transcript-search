When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would seem to me to be an act of desperation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L485"><td><a href="#L485">485</a></td><td>KIRK:  Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your well-known logic explain that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L486"><td><a href="#L486">486</a></td><td>SPOCK:  Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at.</td></tr>
