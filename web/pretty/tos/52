<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>MCCOY:  Starfleet's been trying for six months. If he's alive, isn't it unlikely that he'd receive us now?</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>SPOCK:  What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>UHURA:  Captain, no response on any Starfleet channel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>SPOCK:  Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>KIRK:  Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant?</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>SPOCK:  According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>KIRK:  We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution. Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our communicators.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>YELLOW:  Hold. Your hands above your head, Zeon. Higher. Keep your hands up so you don't touch anything Ekosian. You swine have defiled us for the last time. But that's now ended. Move!</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>KIRK:  How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>MAN [over images]:  The Fuhrer's headquarters reports repulsing an attack by Zeon spacecraft. Our missiles utterly destroyed the enemy.</td></tr>
