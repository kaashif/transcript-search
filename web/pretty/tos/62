<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>MIRANDA:  The key is the mind-link that I learned on Vulcan. Once we have learned the technique of forming a corporate intelligence with the Medusans, the designers, that's where Larry comes in, can work on adapting instruments.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>MCCOY:  I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be. Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad? Why do you do it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>KIRK:  Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness. One of the last of our prejudices. At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty. (they stand for the toast) To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>MCCOY:  How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life? Will we allow it, gentlemen?</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>MIRANDA:  How can one so full of joy and the love of life as you, Doctor, condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life? Can we allow that, gentlemen?</td></tr>
