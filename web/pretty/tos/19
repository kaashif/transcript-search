  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is in orbit of a planet

  KIRK
     You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good
     table.

  MCCOY
     I wonder if he brought his personal chef along
     with him to Cestus Three.

  KIRK
     Probably. Rank hath its privileges.

  MCCOY
     How well we both know that.

  ANNOTATION
     Intercom whistles

  KIRK
     Scotty. Kirk here.

  TRAVERS [OC]
     Travers, Jim. We're waiting.

  KIRK
     Good, Commodore. We're on our way.

  TRAVERS [OC]
     Be sure to bring along your tactical people. I've
     got an interesting problem for them.

  KIRK
     We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out.

  SPOCK
     Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our
     tactical aides come down.

  KIRK
     This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge
     of now here. He probably wants additional advice.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless

  MCCOY
     Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for
     his hospitality? I, for one, could use a good
     non-reconstituted meal.

  SPOCK
     Doctor, you are a sensualist.

  MCCOY
     You bet your pointed ears I am. Ready whenever you
     are, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Six men, including one red shirt, get on the
     transporter platform

  KIRK
     Energise.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     There is no one waiting to meet them. Instead,
     just razed ground and the smoke of a few fires

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert.

  SULU [OC]
     What is it, Captain?

  KIRK
     Cestus Three has been destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     They take cover

  KIRK
     Full alert. Tricorder readings, Mister Spock. Life
     detection.

  SPOCK
     Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing
     us here yesterday.

  KIRK
     Faked. All this happened several days ago. (to a
     man in a yellow shirt) Lang, over there. Look for
     survivors. Kelowitz, (blue shirt) that way. (to
     the red shirt) O'Herlihy, stick with me.

  SPOCK
     Captain, impulses that direction. Very weak,
     possibly a survivor.

  KIRK
     Come on, Bones.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, Stardate 3045.6 The Enterprise has
     responded to a call from Earth observation outpost
     on Cestus Three. On landing, we have discovered
     that the outpost has been destroyed.


LOCATION--Ruins

  MCCOY
     Captain, over there.

  ANNOTATION
     They run to a lone survivor amongst a tangle of
     wreckage

  SOMEONE
     Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal
     injuries for certain.

  MCCOY
     Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal
     injuries for certain. He's in a bad way, Captain.

  KIRK
     Keep him alive, Bones. I want to know what's been
     happening here.

  SPOCK
     Getting another life reading, Captain.

  KIRK
     Survivors?

  SPOCK
     Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures,
     but not human.

  KIRK
     Where?

  SPOCK
     Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven
     zero yards.

  KIRK
     O'Herlihy.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk sends his security guard off to look, but he
     hasn't gone far before he stands up and says

  O'HERLIHY
     Captain, I see something.

  ANNOTATION
     And promptly gets hit by a beam and vanishes.
     There's also an incoming whistle and an explosion.

  KIRK
     Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters.
     Beam us up.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Captain, we're coming under attack. Unidentified
     ship quartering in.


LOCATION--Ruins

  SULU [OC]
     We can't beam you up. I've just rigged up
     defensive screens.

  KIRK
     Keep those screens up. Fire all phasers.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Firing phasers, Captain. The alien has screens up,
     too.


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Take all action necessary to protect the ship.
     We'll hold out here.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Are you under attack, Captain?


LOCATION--Ruins

  SULU [OC]
     We could drop screens.

  KIRK
     Keep those screens up. Worry about us when the
     ship is safe.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK [OC]
     Kirk out.


LOCATION--Ruins

  ANNOTATION
     More bombs rain down around them

  KIRK
     If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll
     be open to phaser attack.

  SPOCK
     We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's
     those disruptors versus our hand phasers.

  KIRK
     We're stuck with it, Mister Spock. We'll have to
     make do with what we've got.

  ANNOTATION
     Carrying the survivor, the away team heads into
     better shelter - Life Support Ramp 3 Level K
     according to the sign

  KIRK
     Kelowitz, Lang, flank out. Lay down fire on
     co-ordinates Mister Spock gave you. Even if you
     don't see them. Keep your heads down.

  ANNOTATION
     Lang and Kelowitz leave

  KIRK
     We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise

  SPOCK
     Sulu is an experienced combat officer.

  KIRK
     It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We
     can't even get at them.

  SPOCK
     Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they
     moved their original position. That intervening
     high ground.

  KIRK
     Can you remember the layout of this place? The
     arsenal?

  SPOCK
     About one hundred yards in that direction. But
     after an attack as thorough as this one

  KIRK
     I'll risk it.

  ANNOTATION
     He does an heroic zigzag run amongst the incoming
     explosions, takes shelter behind an oil drum and
     calls Enterprise

  KIRK
     Kirk here. Report.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Captain, are you all right?


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Never mind about me. What about the ship?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     We returned fire with all phaser banks. Negative
     against its deflector screen.


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Arm your photon torpedoes.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir. Arm photon torpedoes. Stand by.


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Any identification on the attacking vessel?

  SULU [OC]
     No, sir. Doesn't correspond with any configuration
     we're familiar with.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     We can't get visual contact. She's too far away.

  DEPAUL
     Mister Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on.

  SULU
     Photon torpedoes locked on, Captain.


LOCATION--Ruins

  SOMEONE
     KIRK; Fire all banks.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     All banks fired, sir.


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Sulu. Sulu, our communications are being
     interfered with. (An explosion makes him run
     further on into an old bomb crater) Now get this
     straight.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK [OC]
     You do anything you think necessary to protect the
     ship. Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything. Clear?

  SULU
     Clear, Captain, but you


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Never mind about me. Protect my ship!


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Yes, sir. Photon torpedoes negative, Captain. I'm
     warping out of orbit.


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     Good. Contact me when you can. Kirk out.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk ducks into a building. Meanwhile, back over
     at Ramp 3

  SPOCK
     How is he, Doctor?

  MCCOY
     He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him
     some decent care.

  SPOCK
     They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     He joins Kirk in the bomb crater, where a grenade
     launcher is being set up

  SPOCK
     Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving
     toward the high ground. (fizzing sound and smoke)
     They've locked on to my tricorder.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws it away and it goes bang

  SPOCK
     Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and
     built up an overload.

  KIRK
     We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a
     hand with this grenade launcher. Lang!

  SPOCK
     Any word from the Enterprise?

  KIRK
     Sulu's taken her out of orbit.

  KELOWITZ
     They got Lang, sir.

  KIRK
     Did you see them?

  KELOWITZ
     No, sir.

  KIRK
     An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think
     they are?

  KELOWITZ
     If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the
     right. I make it twelve hundred yards, azimuth
     eighty seven. It's pretty close for one of these
     little jewels, Captain.

  KIRK
     It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear.

  ANNOTATION
     He drops a blue ball into the launcher, it zooms
     off and there is a blinding flash and bang.
     Silence reigns until Kirk's communicator beeps.

  KIRK
     Kirk here.

  SULU [OC]
     Captain, the alien's withdrawing. She's at extreme
     range, but our sensors indicate she just activated
     her transporters.

  KIRK
     Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to
     lose her.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir. Our screens are down. We can beam
     you up now, sir.


LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK
     I want a search party of thirty medical personnel
     beamed down immediately to search for survivors.
     Notify the transporter room. Lock onto us. We're
     beaming up.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, supplement. We have beamed back to
     the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit
     of the alien vessel. It appears to be headed
     toward a largely unexplored section of the galaxy.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  KIRK
     Can you tell me what happened?

  MAN
     Scanners reported a ship approaching. We get them
     now and then. They're all welcome to use our
     facilities. You know that.

  KIRK
     Yes, I know.

  MAN
     They came in space normal speed, using our regular
     approach route, but they knocked out our phaser
     batteries with their first salvo. From then on we
     were helpless. We weren't expecting anything! Why
     should we? We didn't have anything anyone would
     want.

  KIRK
     Easy. Easy.

  MAN
     They poured it on, like, like phasers, only worse,
     whatever they were using. I tried to signal them.
     We called up. Tried to surrender. We had women and
     children. I told them that! I begged them! They
     wouldn't listen. They didn't let up for a moment.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages,
     ostensibly from Cestus Three. One for the
     Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself
     and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.

  MAN
     They hit us a full day before you got there,
     Captain. No messages came from us, Captain. Why
     did they do it? Why? Why did they do it? There has
     to be a reason. There has to be a reason!


LOCATION--Captain's quarters

  KIRK
     It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come to
     Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to
     come ashore.

  SPOCK
     Very clever. As to the reason?

  KIRK
     The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the
     only protection in this section of the Federation.
     Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide
     open.

  SPOCK
     You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive
     proof

  KIRK
     I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.

  SPOCK
     Not necessarily, sir. Several possible
     explanations

  KIRK
     How can you explain a massacre like that? No,
     Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate.
     Invasion.

  SPOCK
     Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make
     certain that the alien vessel never reaches its
     home base.

  KIRK
     I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to
     our strength, they'll never dare move against us.
     Captain to helmsman.

  SULU [OC]
     Sulu here, sir.

  KIRK
     Is the alien still making warp five?

  SULU [OC]
     Affirmative, sir.

  KIRK
     Initiate warp six.

  SULU [OC]
     Affirmative, sir.

  KIRK
     Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy
     vessel. Stand by for firing orders. All hands,
     this is the Captain. We are going into battle. All
     hands, battle stations. Red alert. I repeat, red
     alert. This is no drill. This is no drill.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, Stardate 3046.2. We are in hot
     pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the
     Earth outpost on Cestus Three.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Mister DePaul.

  DEPAUL
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     Position.

  DEPAUL
     Twenty two point three parsecs beyond latest chart
     limit, sir.

  KIRK
     All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a
     complete record of this. Mister Spock, what do we
     have on this general area?

  SPOCK
     Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any
     explorations. There are rumours of certain strange
     signals on subspace channels. However, none has
     ever been recorded.

  KIRK
     Anything on intelligent life forms?

  SPOCK
     Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours
     only. More like space legends.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel.

  SULU
     They must be aware we're after them, sir. They've
     gone to warp six also.

  KIRK
     Warp factor seven.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Something the matter, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous,
     Captain.

  KIRK
     Thank you, Mister Spock. I mean to catch them.

  SCOTT
     We'll either catch them or blow up, Captain. They
     may be faster than we are.

  KIRK
     They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?

  KIRK
     Of course.

  SPOCK
     I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be
     sufficient. Destruction might be unnecessary.

  KIRK
     Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister
     Spock.

  SPOCK
     The destruction of the alien vessel will not help
     that colony, Jim.

  KIRK
     If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back,
     attacking other Federation installations.

  SPOCK
     I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life

  KIRK
     There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy.
     Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a
     crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear?

  SPOCK
     Very clear, Captain.

  KIRK
     I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu.

  SULU
     Alien ship maintaining interval, Captain. Now at
     warp seven.

  KIRK
     Warp factor eight.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks surprised. Scotty is aghast.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Captain to phaser banks. All components at battle
     ready. All banks primed.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Aft phaser to Bridge. Alert status. All weapons at
     operational ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, the ship has not blown up, and Sulu has a
     grin on his face

  SULU
     Captain.

  KIRK
     Yes, Mister Sulu.

  SULU
     Closing on target, sir.

  KIRK
     Good. Mister DePaul.

  DEPAUL
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     Our position.

  DEPAUL
     Two two seven nine pl, sir. Uncharted solar system
     at two four six six pm.

  KIRK
     Is it on the alien's course?

  DEPAUL
     No, sir. He's headed away from it.

  UHURA
     Captain, sensors report we're being scanned.

  KIRK
     By the alien ship?

  UHURA
     No, sir. It's from that solar system ahead.

  KIRK
     Any interference? Resistance?

  UHURA
     No, sir, Just scanning beams. It's on an unusual
     wave length.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     It would appear someone is curious about us.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from
     that solar system?

  SULU
     Yes, sir. We're closing, sir.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those
     scanning beams?

  UHURA
     There's no hostility, sir. They're not tractors or
     weapons of any sort, Just increasing in intensity.
     Steady. Regular. It's growing stronger, sir.

  SULU
     Captain!

  KIRK
     Yes, what is it?

  SULU
     The alien. It's slowing down. Warp five, four,
     two. It's going sublight, sir. Sir? It's stopped
     dead in space.

  KIRK
     He may be turning to fight.

  SULU
     No, sir. They're just dead out there.

  KIRK
     Are you sure?

  SULU
     Yes, sir. Unmoving.

  KIRK
     Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to
     fire phaser banks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu,
     continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into
     computer. Computers will control attack.

  SPOCK
     Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing
     by.

  SULU
     Range is one eight one zero. One seven six zero.
     Range is one seven zero zero. One six four zero.
     Range is one five nine zero. One five five zero
     and closing, sir.

  (Suddenly, the ship decelerates, and everyone hangs on to something as the lights dim.) SULU
     Warp six, warp five, four, warp three, warp one.
     Sublight, Captain. We're stuck, Captain. It's
     impossible, but. It's impossible.

  KIRK
     From warp eight? Have you lost your mind?

  SPOCK
     Same as the alien, Captain.

  KIRK
     Mister Scott, report.

  SCOTT
     We're dead, Captain. Locked up. Frozen tight. All
     propulsion systems read zero.

  SOMEONE
     KIRK; Life systems?

  SCOTT
     They're all normal, sir. Atmosphere, heat, light.
     No variance.

  KIRK
     Phaser banks. Report.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     We're all inoperative here, Captain. No power at
     all. No faulty circuits I can find. Just no power.

  KIRK
     Damage Control, report.

  SPOCK
     All systems report normal, Captain. No
     ascertainable damage.

  SOMEONE
     KIRK; Then what is it?

  SCOTT
     I don't know, sir, but whatever it is, we canna
     move.

  SPOCK
     We're being held in place, Captain, apparently
     from that solar system.

  SOMEONE
     KIRK; This far out? That's impossible.

  SPOCK
     We are being held.

  KIRK
     Tractor beam?

  SPOCK
     No, sir. An unidentifiable power.

  ANNOTATION
     The lights flicker and the viewscreen goes
     psychedelic.

  METRON [OC]
     We are the Metrons. You are one of two crafts
     which have come into our space on a mission of
     violence. This is not permissible. Yet we have
     analysed you and have learned that your violent
     tendencies are inherent. So be it. We will control
     them. We will resolve your conflict in the way
     most suited to your limited mentalities. Captain
     James Kirk.

  KIRK
     This is Kirk.

  METRON [OC]
     We have prepared a planet with a suitable
     atmosphere. You will be taken there, as will the
     Captain of the Gorn ship which you have been
     pursuing. There you will settle your dispute.

  KIRK
     I don't understand.
