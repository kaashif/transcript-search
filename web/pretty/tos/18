The Squire of Gothos
TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A Yeoman is distributing coffees when McCoy enters

  DESALLE
     All clear ahead, Captain. The sensors indicate
     zero register.

  KIRK
     Forward readings, Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero
     space density.

  KIRK
     Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta
     Six wants their supplies. Let's get across this
     void in a hurry.

  MCCOY
     Void, star desert. The word conjures up pictures
     of dunes, oases, mirages.

  KIRK
     Sunlight, palm trees. We're nine hundred light
     years from that kind of desert, Bones.

  SPOCK
     The precise meaning of the word desert is a
     waterless, barren wasteland. I fail to understand
     your romantic nostalgia for such a place.

  MCCOY
     That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock. I can't
     imagine a mirage ever disturbing those
     mathematically perfect brain waves of yours.

  SPOCK
     Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into
     quadrant nine oh four. Beta Six is eight days
     distant.

  KIRK
     Something, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable
     space-displacement reading.

  KIRK
     Can you verify that, Navigator?

  DESALLE
     No, sir. Forward sweeps are negative. Wait.
     Verified, sir. We must be in some sort of light
     warp or we'd have picked it up earlier.

  KIRK
     Put it on visual.

  ANNOTATION
     A purple globe appears on the viewscreen

  DESALLE
     Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E.
     We'll be passing close.

  SPOCK
     Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all
     our records.

  KIRK
     And yet, here it is. No time to investigate.
     Science stations, gather data for computer banks.
     Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio.

  UHURA
     Strong interference on subspace, Captain. The
     planet must be a natural radio source.

  KIRK
     Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to
     starboard, Mister Sulu.

  SULU
     Forty degrees.

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches for the switch, and sways as if dizzy,
     then stands up and vanishes

  KIRK
     Sulu!

  ANNOTATION
     He dashes to Sulu's station, then suddenly stops
     and disappears too

  DESALLE
     Mister Spock, they're gone!

  SPOCK
     Emergency! Full reverse power!

  SOMEONE
     Ship's log Stardate 2124.5. First Officer Spock
     reporting for Captain James Kirk. We are orbiting
     the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert. For
     four hours, we have made every possible instrument
     sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain
     unaccounted for. I have placed the ship on red
     alert.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is now orbiting a red planet with white
     whispy clouds

  SCOTT
     We've searched again from stem to stern. If
     they're not down on that planet, they're nowhere.

  DESALLE
     No sign of human life on the surface, sir. Unless
     the instruments aren't functioning.

  SPOCK
     Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps.
     Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands?

  UHURA
     All of them, Mister Spock. No response.

  DESALLE
     With due respect, sir. Request permission to
     transport to the surface immediately and carry out
     a search.

  MCCOY
     I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting
     for?

  SPOCK
     The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the
     responsibility for your safety. (to Sulu's
     replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your
     geophysical findings for the surface below.

  JAEGER
     No detectable soil or vegetation. Extremely hot,
     toxic atmosphere swept by tornadic storm.
     Continuous volcanic eruptions. Deadly to any
     lifeforms such as we know it without oxygen and
     life-support systems.

  SPOCK
     Estimate survival time of two unprotected
     individuals down there.

  JAEGER
     Not very long.

  UHURA
     Mister Spock. Look.

  ANNOTATION
     Words are appearing on the monitor above her head,
     in gothic script. Spock reads them out loud

  SPOCK
     Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this,
     Lieutenant. USS Enterprise to signaler on planet
     surface. Identify self.

  ANNOTATION
     The reply comes up on the monitor

  SPOCK
     Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced
     tally ho.

  DESALLE
     Some kind of a joke, sir?

  SPOCK
     I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any
     at all.

  MCCOY
     One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on
     that planet.

  SPOCK
     You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter
     room.

  SCOTT
     Request assignment to the search party, sir.

  SPOCK
     No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared
     here. Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with
     full communications, armament, and life-support
     gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge
     may be crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will
     accompany. If those peculiar signals are coming
     from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their
     rationality is in question. Dismissed.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  UHURA [OC]
     No more messages from below, sir, but I've locked
     onto their original source.

  SPOCK
     Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott.
     Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish
     contact with us immediately. Use the laser beacon
     if necessary. Ready, Scott?

  SCOTT
     Ready, Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Activate.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     The landing party arrive on grass, amidst trees
     and shrubs. Jaeger starts scanning immediately.

  MCCOY
     Where are your storms, Jaeger?

  JAEGER
     Atmosphere exactly the same as ours.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes of his oxygen mask, sniffs, and signals
     that the other two can do the same.

  DESALLE
     DeSalle to Enterprise. DeSalle to Enterprise. It
     doesn't function. We're cut off.

  MCCOY
     (trying his own communicator) No response.

  DESALLE
     (to Jaeger) Keep trying with yours. Something's
     blocking the beacon. I've got to find open ground.

  ANNOTATION
     He wanders off through the shrubs

  DESALLE
     Mister Jaeger! McCoy!

  ANNOTATION
     They join him to see a stone building in the
     gothic style, with an iron-bound oak door. They
     approach cautiously, and enter


LOCATION--Drawing Room

  ANNOTATION
     The place is stuffed full of things. A bust of
     Napoleon on a stand, a suit of armour, a globe,
     tapestry and swords and shields on the walls, an
     open fire, a harpsichord and a large mirror

  MCCOY
     In the name of heaven, where are we?

  ANNOTATION
     They head down steps into the room, past the Salt
     Monster in an alcove

  DESALLE
     Look.

  ANNOTATION
     Sulu and Kirk are displayed in a mini-minstrel's
     gallery. McCoy scans them.

  MCCOY
     There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures.

  ANNOTATION
     The main door slams shut, and there's a man in an
     embroidered coat playing the harpsichord

  TRELANE
     I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite
     display pair, but I suppose you want them back
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     He waves his hand and the two men come back to
     life

  SULU
     Where are we?

  TRELANE
     Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little
     planet of Gothos.

  KIRK
     What happened? Fill me in.

  MCCOY
     You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've
     been looking for you for four hours.

  TRELANE
     You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you
     here, but when I saw you passing by I simply could
     not resist.

  KIRK
     I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship
     Enterprise.

  TRELANE
     Ah, so you're the Captain of these brave lads. My
     greetings and felicitations, Captain. So good of
     you and your officers to drop in. Absolutely
     smashing.

  KIRK
     Who are you? Where do you come from?

  SOMEONE
     General Trelane, retired. At your service, sirs.
     My home is your home.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes back to his playing

  DESALLE
     We've lost contact with the ship, Captain. We're
     trapped here.

  TRELANE
     I can't tell you how delighted I am to have
     visitors from the very planet that I've made my
     hobby. Yes, but according to my observations, I
     didn't think you capable of such voyages.

  JAEGER
     Notice the period, Captain. Nine hundred light
     years from Earth. It's what might be seen through
     a viewing scope if it were powerful enough.

  TRELANE
     Ah, yes. I've been looking in on the doings on
     your lively little Earth.

  KIRK
     Then you've been looking in on the doings nine
     hundred years past.

  TRELANE
     Oh, really? Have I made an error in time? How
     fallible of me. Oh, I did so want to make you feel
     at home. I'm quite proud of the detail.

  KIRK
     General Trelane.

  TRELANE
     Retired, sir. Just Squire Trelane now. And you may
     call me Squire. Yes, I rather fancy that.

  KIRK
     For what purpose have you imprisoned us here?

  TRELANE
     Imprisoned? Nonsense. You're my guests. You see, I
     just finished my studies of your curious and
     fascinating society. You came by at the most
     propitious moment. I want to know all about your
     campaigns, your battles, your missions of
     conquest.

  KIRK
     Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When
     we do battle, it is only because we have no
     choice.

  TRELANE
     Ah, but that's the official story, eh?

  KIRK
     I must ask you to let us go back to our ship.

  TRELANE
     I wouldn't hear of it. You shall join me in a
     repast. I want to learn all about your feelings on
     war and killing and conquest. That sort of thing.
     Do you know that you're one of the few predator
     species that preys even on itself?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk returns to the main group, where DeSalle has
     his hand on his phaser

  KIRK
     Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle.

  TRELANE
     DeSalle, did you say? Un vrai Francais?

  DESALLE
     My ancestry is French, yes.

  TRELANE
     Ah, monsieur. Vive la gloire. Vive Napoleon. You
     know, I admire your Napoleon very much.

  KIRK
     This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor
     McCoy, our medical officer. Mister Sulu, our
     helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist.

  TRELANE
     Welcome, good physicianer and honourable sir.
     (bows low)

  SULU
     Is he kidding?

  TRELANE
     Und Offizier Jaeger, und der deutsche Soldat,
     nein? (gives a little Prussian salute then marches
     around) Eins, zwei, drei, vier. Gehen vir mit dem
     Schiessgewehr.

  JAEGER
     I'm a scientist, not a military man.

  TRELANE
     Oh come now. We're all military men under the
     skin. And how we do love our uniforms.

  ANNOTATION
     Trelane is admiring himself in his mirror when he
     spots DeSalle raising his weapon, and with a wave
     of the hand, stops him

  TRELANE
     What an interesting weapon you've got there. Do
     let me see it.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes it out of DeSalle's hand, and he can move
     again
