<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>TYRE: What you didn't see was that we'd found a network of caves in the hillside. When the Wraith attacked, the entrance collapsed, and we were sealed in. It took us three days to dig our way out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>RAKAI: And by then, the place was crawling with them. It was obvious they were gearing up for an attack. It took another two weeks before we could find our way through the 'gate and by then, it was too late.</td></tr>
