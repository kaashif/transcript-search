TEASER

LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks with McKay, Keller, and Sheppard
     through the Gate Room and up to her office. Keller
     is dressed in off-world gear with a pack on her
     back. McKay and Sheppard also wear off-world gear,
     Sheppard sucks on a lollipop.

  CARTER
     Which planet is this again?

  SHEPPARD


  M5V-801.


  MCKAY
     The one with the frequent tremors.

  KELLER
     Not to mention an abnormally high amount of people
     with debilitating respiratory problems.

  MCKAY
     (dismissive) It's a mining planet. It's not that
     surprising.

  KELLER
     Not everybody worked in the mines, Rodney.

  SHEPPARD
     Get to the point, guys.

  MCKAY
     They're experiencing upwards of four tremors a
     day. My seismic team has concluded that the area
     where they've built their settlement is
     dangerously unstable. So--

  KELLER
     (interrupting) Not to mention my environmental and
     air quality tests came back way into the red.

  MCKAY
     My analysis was enough, thank you.

  KELLER
     (smirking) Well, obviously, it wasn't enough for
     them. Anyway, these people said they've
     experienced tremors for as long as they can
     remember.

  MCKAY
     Yes, and I'm pretty sure they've been breathing
     even longer. So again, my problem trumps yours.

  CARTER
     This is not a contest! Obviously, they're living
     in a settlement that's not safe for habitation.
     You need to convince them to move to another part
     of the continent.


LOCATION--CARTER'S OFFICE

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we tried. It's not working.

  CARTER
     Why not?

  SHEPPARD
     Twenty years ago, the Genii kind of took over the
     planet--employed them all as miners.

  CARTER
     Mining what?

  MCKAY
     Haven't a clue. Whatever it was, they cleaned out
     the deposits and left.

  CARTER
     So...?

  SHEPPARD
     So, they think we're like the Genii, and they want
     their cut.

  CARTER
     Ah.

  KELLER
     They're willing to move, but they have a list of
     demands a mile and a half long.

  SHEPPARD
     And negotiating with alien settlements is not
     exactly why I joined the Air Force.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter half-quirks a wry smile.

  KELLER
     We were hoping if you had some time, maybe you
     could come...

  MCKAY
     (talking over her) It would save us a lot of time
     in the back and forth.

  CARTER
     Okay. I'll free up my afternoon.

  SHEPPARD
     Appreciate that, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves. McKay and Keller start to follow.

  CARTER
     Jennifer, Rodney...I'll meet you at the 'gate in
     one hour.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller looks startled, but nods.

  MCKAY
     Uh...I was rather hoping you would go by yourself.
     And I would--

  CARTER
     (firmly) One hour.

  ANNOTATION
     Chastened, McKay sighs and leaves.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT



LOCATION--M5V-801 FIELD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Keller, and McKay walk across a fallow
     field, following a cart trail. Keller is breathing
     heavily.

  KELLER
     (panting) Man...I gotta start doing more cardio.
     All this...back and forth is getting me winded. We
     couldn't have taken the jumper?

  MCKAY
     (also slightly winded) Oh, suck it up. It's not
     that bad. I have to hike this much almost every
     day.

  CARTER
     (surprised) You do?

  MCKAY
     (nodding) Yeah, I'm a very active person.

  CARTER
     (dubious) You are?

  KELLER
     (dubious) Your last physical would kind of
     contradict you.

  MCKAY
     (piqued) That is private medical information that
     should not be so cavalierly shared in casual
     conversation, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and Carter smile.

  KELLER
     I don't think it comes as a great surprise to the
     Colonel.

  MCKAY
     That's not the point! You know, I'm no Ronon. I'm
     not going to be on the cover of... Shape magazine
     anytime soon. But uh...I can handle myself in
     combat. Stand my ground when I need to--

  ANNOTATION
     A cracking sound under his feet can be heard an
     instant before he disappears from sight, falling
     into a hole.

  KELLER
     Rodney!

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to go to where he disappears, but
     Carter pulls her back.

  CARTER
     Don't move.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay can be heard groaning down below.

  CARTER
     Get down on your stomach. Spread out your wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Keller crawl on their bellies towards
     the opening.

  CARTER
     Rodney? McKay, are you all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Visible at the bottom of the hole, McKay lies on
     his back. He shifts one arm and moves his head.

  MCKAY
     Ow.

  CARTER
     (under her breath) Oh, thank God.

  KELLER
     Don't move, okay?

  MCKAY
     (weakly) Not a problem.

  CARTER
     We're gonna head back to the 'gate. Try to get
     some help.

  KELLER
     Just-just try to stay as still--

  ANNOTATION
     More of the ground gives way sending Keller and
     Carter crashing into the hole, one screaming as
     they fall.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Keller, McKay, and Carter lie amongst the debris
     from the collapsed ceiling. They groan and try and
     sit up. Around them are the remains of an
     underground room, with beams, lamps, and wooden
     crates. There are roofs as if there are adjacent
     buildings, and doors as well.

  KELLER
     (grunting) Don't move if you feel any shooting
     pains.

  MCKAY
     I would never move if that was the case. Ah.

  CARTER
     (groaning) Ow. Well, it doesn't look like any of
     us are bleeding.

  MCKAY
     (groaning) At least externally.

  KELLER
     That's a godsend.

  ANNOTATION
     They grunt and groan as they get to their feet and
     look around.

  KELLER
     This whole place is a tetanus shot waiting to
     happen. In fact...where the hell are we?

  MCKAY
     (pointing to the Genii insignia on the wall) I'd
     guess the Genii mining facility.

  CARTER
     Just don't build 'em like they used to, huh?

  MCKAY
     I'm particularly not fond of the ceiling work.

  KELLER
     If this is part of a larger facility...

  CARTER
     Then there should be a way for us to walk out of
     here. Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks over to a blue door on one side of
     the room and starts to try to open it. McKay
     wanders over to a red door. He starts to touch the
     wheel to open it.

  CARTER
     Little help here.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks over, surprised.

  MCKAY
     What about this one?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller is already helping Carter with the door.

  CARTER
     Well...red means bad.

  MCKAY
     Oh. Can't argue with that logic.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay joins the others who are pulling on the
     door. He studies a keypad next to the door.

  MCKAY
     Well, did you see this? That's not going to budge
     unless we enter the right code. Look, these
     symbols are Genii numerals.

  KELLER
     Yeah, but...you can crack the code, though, right?

  CARTER
     (as McKay speaks) Well, it would be a lot
     easier...

  MCKAY
     (as Carter speaks) Yeah, it'd be a lot easier...

  CARTER AND MCKAY
     ...if it was electronic.

  CARTER
     What he said.

  MCKAY
     What she said.

  CARTER
     It's not impossible, though, right?

  MCKAY
     No...no. It's just...highly, highly unlikely.

  CARTER
     Okay. So...door number two?

  ANNOTATION
     She points to the red door.

  MCKAY
     (to Carter) After you, Monty.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk over to the other door.

  CARTER
     Okay...on three. One...two...three.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay try to turn to wheel, but it
     doesn't budge.

  MCKAY
     There goes that plan.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter spots a thin metal rod on the floor nearby.

  CARTER
     Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

  ANNOTATION
     They place the rod in the wheel to act a lever.

  CARTER
     Okay...one, two, three...go!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay are able to move the wheel a bit.

  KELLER
     Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What if...what if that
     door was...sealed for a reason?

  MCKAY
     (patronizing) What, you think maybe there's a
     scary monster back there?

  KELLER
     No. But this is a mining facility, and who knows
     what kind of toxins are in there. Like you said:
     "Red means bad."

  CARTER
     Well... (shrugging) I'm willing to take the
     chance.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay push open the door, which opens
     outwards. McKay holds Carter back before she
     falls.

  CARTER
     Whoa.

  ANNOTATION
     They stare out into a deep chasm. Other chambers
     are on the far side, held up by metal girders. A
     catwalk that bridged the chasm between their
     chamber and the others has fallen apart, and there
     is nothing on the other side of the door.

  MCKAY
     I guess in Genii, red means "screwed."

  CARTER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     They close the door. Carter checks her watch.
     McKay goes over to study the Genii keypad again.

  CARTER
     Okay, look. It's...we've been in the field for
     what, half an hour? We've got another five before
     we need to check in. So, the safest thing for us
     to do is just sit tight and wait. When we don't
     check in, they'll send a team. Our radios should
     work down here, right?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, they should.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter checks out an empty metal cabinet.

  CARTER
     Okay. So, we...we sit and wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller sits.

  KELLER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tries to pry open the keypad control panel.

  KELLER
     Anyone, uh...bring any cards?

  CARTER
     (chuckling) No.

  ANNOTATION
     A loud rumbling shakes the room.

  MCKAY
     Tremor!

  ANNOTATION
     They try to take cover against the walls of the
     room as it sways. Eventually, the shaking stops,
     after a lot of metallic groaning.

  MCKAY
     That sounded very, very bad.

  CARTER
     Uh, what do you suppose the probability is that
     this room is on the same kind of metal stilts as
     those other rooms we saw over there?

  MCKAY
     Very high.

  KELLER
     But...this one's more stable, right? I mean, we're
     till standing.

  CARTER
     Yeah, but with the three of us and this dirt,
     we've just added what? Three-four hundred pounds?

  MCKAY
     Uh...I'd say like five hundred.

  CARTER
     Right. And this region experiences how many
     tremors a day?

  MCKAY
     Four times a day at least.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sighs heavily.

  KELLER
     What is it? What's wrong?

  CARTER
     The supports that are stopping this room from
     dropping into the chasm are going to rapidly
     destabilize now that we've added all this extra
     weight.

  MCKAY
     I don't think we're going to be able to just wait
     for Atlantis to figure out we're missing.

  CARTER
     You're right. We're gonna have to find a way out
     of here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay look at the ceiling. Keller walks
     around a bit.

  KELLER
     Well...there are a lot of...lot of crates in here.

  MCKAY
     Yeah. Rickety old ones. I killed like, three of
     them on my way down.

  KELLER
     Yeah, but maybe we could make, like, a pyramid.
     Stack them up. Climb out.

  MCKAY
     I don't think there's enough to--

  CARTER
     (interrupting) Uh, there are, actually. Just
     barely enough to get us high enough, but we should
     be able to make it work.

  MCKAY
     You think they'll support our weight?

  CARTER
     Only one way to find out.

  ANNOTATION
     They work together to start pushing the crates.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Keller is using a piece of metal sheeting
     to sweep as much of the dirt and unnecessary
     debris as she can out the red door into the chasm.

  MCKAY
     All right, look...if we're actually going to do
     this, I figure we need to stack these things,
     like, twenty feet high in order to climb out. So
     no matter how we build it, it's going to be
     unstable.

  CARTER
     Well...only one person has to climb it.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shuts the red door and joins them. They
     look at her. Her eyes widen.

  KELLER
     Oh. No, I-I'm kind of awful with heights, so...

  MCKAY
     So, Sam goes.

  CARTER
     (surprised) What, you're not even going to
     consider yourself?

  MCKAY
     It-it's heights! I'm probably worse than she is!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter makes a face, resigned then starts to climb
     on the boxes.

  CARTER
     Let's get started.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay watches protectively as she clambers up.

  MCKAY
     All right, fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and McKay pass boxes up to Carter, who
     keeps stacking them. The wood creaks ominously and
     they all freeze, wide-eyed.

  KELLER
     (gesturing) Maybe...maybe you should come down
     from there. It-it-it sounds like it's...

  ANNOTATION
     There is more creaking. Carter cautiously climbs
     onto the box. She looks up to the light just
     outside her grasp. The bottom box shatters,
     sending the ones on top and Carter tumbling onto
     the floor.

  MCKAY
     Sam!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller rush over to her as she groans
     and tries to move.

  KELLER
     Easy, easy. You okay?

  MCKAY
     Is she all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sits up, clutching her side.

  CARTER
     (groaning) That was fun.

  MCKAY
     Look, the bottom level won't hold. The crates
     aren't strong enough to stack.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

  KELLER
     So...

  ANNOTATION
     The whole room shakes again from another tremor.

  CARTER
     So...we need another plan. And quick.


LOCATION--CHASM


LOCATION--GENII MINING FACILITY

  ANNOTATION
     The trio scavenge the closets. Keller finds an
     accordion file.

  KELLER
     Hey, I got some files here. Can anyone read Genii?

  MCKAY
     Hello, hello.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay holds up his file from another closet.

  CARTER
     What have you got?

  MCKAY
     Grappling hook. Or at least, something we can use
     as a grappling hook.

  ANNOTATION
     He plunks down a small metal device that has a
     four pronged hooks on either end.

  KELLER
     Great! Now all we need is some rope.

  MCKAY
     Okay, just a sec--the ceiling is like, what,
     twenty feet?

  CARTER
     Twenty-five?

  MCKAY
     All right, twenty-five. So, our jackets end to end
     are five or six feet...tie those to our shirts,
     maybe even our pants together...that should be
     able to get us up there and support our weight.

  ANNOTATION
     While McKay has been speaking, Carter moves to
     another metal cabinet in the room.

  KELLER
     Great.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts trying to remove one of the hooks.
     Keller takes off her jacket and throws it by him.
     He glances up to see her about to strip off her
     t-shirt. She has it pulled to bra level when...

  CARTER
     Found rope!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter holds up a rope. Keller smiles triumphantly
     while pulling her shirt back down. McKay looks
     disappointed.

  CARTER
     Rope and lanterns.

  MCKAY
     (without enthusiasm) Oh good.

  CARTER
     More than enough for what we need.

  MCKAY
     (still flatly) Well, nice work.

  CARTER
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sets the rope down and tries to find both
     ends. McKay picks up one end and starts to tie it
     to the grappling hook.

  CARTER
     What are you doing?

  MCKAY
     Well, I'm going to tie the rope on and toss it up
     there so you can climb up.

  CARTER
     I can't do it.

  MCKAY
     (chiding) Hey, quitter talk.

  CARTER
     No, I can't climb this. This rope--it's too thin.
     We need to tie knots in it. I need something to
     grip onto.

  MCKAY
     Right. That's a lot of knots.

  CARTER
     Well, we only need about...thirty feet or so.

  MCKAY
     Okay, well, you gals get started on the, uh,
     knotting, and, um, I'll read those files.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Keller both look affronted.

  MCKAY
     What? Look, they could contain the code to the
     door, there. Besides, three people can't knot the
     same rope. Unless either of you speak Genii.

  CARTER
     (piqued) Fine. We'll get started.

  KELLER
     Well, want to play twenty questions? I'll let you
     go first. Animal, vegetable, or mineral?

  CARTER
     I'm good. Thanks.

  KELLER
     (sighing) Well, here's a better one we can play.
     Brad Pitt or George Clooney?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at her blankly, then begins to
     consider.

  KELLER
     If you had to choose.

  CARTER
     Mmm...Clooney, I guess.

  KELLER
     (pointing to herself) Pitt all the way. Okay, you
     go. Come on, it's easy. Any two guys I would know.

  CARTER
     Okay, okay. Un...Brian Greene or Neil Degrasse
     Tyson?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller stares at Carter with a blank look.

  CARTER
     They're physicists.

  KELLER
     Uh-huh.

  CARTER
     They're on t.v. I picked ones you should know.

  KELLER
     (shrugging) Uh...Brian Greene, I guess?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) Pfft...Tyson, all the way.

  MCKAY
     Are you talking about Neil Degrasse Tyson? He once
     stole an idea from me. Did I tell you that story?

  CARTER
     Only about a dozen times, McKay.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns back to his reading.

  KELLER
     We're playing "Who would you rather...?" Want to
     join us?

  MCKAY
     Uh..."would you--" Sorry, I don't get it.

  KELLER
     Well, if you had to choose who to fool around
     with, would it be...Robert Redford or Paul Newman?

  MCKAY
     (vaguely disturbed) Uh...neither?

  KELLER
     Yeah, I know. But if you had to.

  MCKAY
     If I had to? So, I'm to choose which one of those
     guys I would want to force themselves on me
     because--

  KELLER
     (challenging) It's just a dumb game, McKay. You're
     not secure enough in your masculinity to play a
     dumb game?

  ANNOTATION
     She and Carter exchange amused looks.

  MCKAY
     Uh, yes, well I think I am. I just...I think I
     should go back to my reading. You know, the one
     thing that could get us out of here?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns away, but looks up as if hearing
     something above.

  KELLER
     Newman.

  CARTER
     Absolutely. Not even a question.

  MCKAY
     Shut up a sec.

  KELLER
     No! We're allowed to talk.

  MCKAY
     No, no, no. I hear something.

  ANNOTATION
     They listen and can hear faint voices and movement
     above.

  MCKAY
     There's someone up there. (calling out) Help!
     We're stuck down here! Hello?

  KELLER
     What if the ceiling caves in on them too?

  MCKAY
     Well, we came through that section. It's been
     eaten away by rust. The rest of the ceiling looks
     fine.

  CARTER
     He's right. As long as they don't fall in the
     hole, they should be able to get help. (calling
     out) Hello!?

  ANNOTATION
     The laughing voices sound closer.

  MCKAY
     Help! We're stuck down here! Can you hear us!

  ANNOTATION
     Two young boys appear in the opening.

  BOY ONE
     Hello?

  MCKAY
     Oh, thank god.

  BOY TWO
     Who are you?

  CARTER
     We're visitors! We were on our way to speak to the
     people of your settlement.

  BOY ONE
     You shouldn't be down there.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, we know. We fell down here by accident.

  BOY TWO
     You all okay?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, yeah, we're fine. We're just stuck. We need
     some help.

  BOY ONE
     You shouldn't be down there.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) Yeah, thanks, kid. Like I said--

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs his arm to interrupt.

  CARTER
     Go tell your parents! Tell them where we are--that
     we're stuck, and we need help.

  ANNOTATION
     The boys exchange looks.

  BOY TWO
     I don't think we can do that.

  MCKAY
     What? Why not?

  BOY ONE
     We're not really supposed to play out here. If our
     parents find out...

  CARTER
     It's okay. I promise you won't get into trouble.

  BOY ONE
     You don't know my father. He'll be very upset.

  CARTER
     I'll explain the situation to him. It'll be okay.

  KELLER
     Please? We're...hurt. We need help.

  BOY TWO
     (accusing) Wait a minute, he said you were all
     okay. I asked him!

  MCKAY
     (angrily) All right, listen to me you little
     brats! I am older than you, and I am in charge!

  KELLER
     Rodney. Rodney.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller tries to tug on him and calm him down. He
     ignores her.

  MCKAY
     You will go back to your parents! You will tell
     them we need help! Or so help me--

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs his arm and interrupts.

  CARTER
     Do you need something?! Anything? We can get it
     for you. If you help us, we can get you whatever
     you want.

  ANNOTATION
     The boys' eyes widen and they start whispering
     amongst themselves.

  MCKAY
     (to Carter) Oh, yes. Good. Great idea. Yes.

  CARTER
     Thanks.

  MCKAY
     Maybe you can show them your um...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gestures to his chest.

  CARTER
     (offended) Excuse me?

  MCKAY
     I was once a ten year old boy too. I know what
     gets their attention.

  ANNOTATION
     He raises his fists and looks up as if mimicking
     how Carter should lift her shirt. Carter continues
     to glare at him.

  CARTER
     McKay!

  MCKAY
     What? Do you want to get out of here or not?

  CARTER
     I think we can reason with them without resorting
     to that, thank you.

  MCKAY
     (sighing, dubious) If you say so.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Keller hopefully, who glares at him,
     then pointedly ignores him by looking back up at
     the boys and shaking her head.

  BOY ONE
     We gotta go now. Bye!

  KELLER
     No! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

  ANNOTATION
     The boys disappear. One drops his head back into
     the opening briefly.

  BOY ONE
     Uh...good luck!

  MCKAY
     Would it have killed you to show 'em--

  CARTER
     Drop it, McKay! It's not gonna happen.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs. Carter looks at her watch.

  CARTER
     Four hours and fifty minutes.

  MCKAY
     I'm warning you--I mean, I could go crazy down
     here. Ever since the whole jumper thing a couple
     of years ago, I've been very bad in tight spaces.

  CARTER
     (scoffing) Please. That's nothing. I was stuck in
     a transporter with Zelenka for three hours. Now,
     that's hard.

  MCKAY
     Wait a second, what-what are you saying? You don't
     like Zelenka?

  CARTER
     (backpedaling) No, I just...It-it was more
     claustrophobic than this.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but that's not what you said. You-you
     emphasized Zelenka. You said, "being stuck with
     Zelenka for three hours", like that was the hard
     part.

  KELLER
     (apologetically) It did kind of sound that way.

  CARTER
     Look--

  MCKAY
     You can say you don't like him. It's fine! I don't
     like him.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller chuckles and makes a face.

  KELLER
     Well, he's certainly a unique guy. He's always
     telling me how nice my...hair smells. It's a
     little weird.

  CARTER
     He's a very good person.

  MCKAY
     Well, yeah, sure, sure, sure. He's the best. You
     just don't like him.

  CARTER
     I did not say that!

  MCKAY
     No, you didn't have to. I know which one's your
     favorite now.

  ANNOTATION
     He points to himself.

  CARTER
     It's not a contest!

  MCKAY
     Everything is a contest.

  CARTER
     (angrily) Don't you have some reading to do?

  MCKAY
     There's nothing in there. Certainly nothing about
     the...door code.

  CARTER
     So?

  MCKAY
     So.

  KELLER
     Back to knotting.

  ANNOTATION
     After several rounds of knotting.

  KELLER
     Steve Carrell or Stephen Colbert?

  CARTER
     Oh...Colbert I think.

  MCKAY
     Carrell...but I would pick Jon Stewart over both
     of them.

  CARTER
     Hmph.

  MCKAY
     (quickly) If I was forced to.

  KELLER
     Uh-huh.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles and nods knowingly.

  KELLER
     Are you and Katie still, um...?

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Oh, uh...well, it-it's kind of
     messed up now.

  KELLER
     Why, what happened?

  MCKAY
     Well, I was going to...propose. Uh--

  CARTER
     (shocked) You were?

  MCKAY
     Yeah. I bought her a ring and everything. You
     know, was going to...ask her, and then the, uh,
     quarantine error happened.

  KELLER
     What does that have to do with anything?

  MCKAY
     Well, I don't particularly want to go into the
     details, but uh, you know, I just, I told her that
     I needed some time for me. Not, you know, it had
     nothing to do with her. I just-I just needed to
     figure some stuff out. And now she doesn't want to
     speak to me. She's filed for a transfer back to
     Earth...

  KELLER
     You broke up with her. That's a break-up.

  MCKAY
     No, I didn't!

  CARTER
     Yeah, you did.

  MCKAY
     (confused) No, I-I said I needed the time for me.

  KELLER
     Yeah, code for "I'm not that into you anymore."

  MCKAY
     But I meant it!

  KELLER
     It doesn't matter! You can't "almost" propose to
     someone and then take it back! That's a
     relationship killer.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks to Carter, who shrugs in agreement
     with Keller.

  MCKAY
     (sadly) Oh. Oh, I suppose it was for the best. I
     mean, she deserves to be with someone who would've
     known that.

  ANNOTATION
     He chuckles self-consciously. Keller smiles in
     sympathy.

  KELLER
     What she deserves is to be with a nice guy, like
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay smiles at her.

  CARTER
     Hey!

  MCKAY
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at the rope.

  CARTER
     We're finished.

  MCKAY
     Oooh! Finally! Right.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay grabs the rope and hook from Carter before
     she can stop him.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Keller move a couple crates away. McKay
     gets ready to throw the hook upward.

  BOY ONE
     (from a distance) Yeah, over here!

  MCKAY
     You guys hear that?

  KELLER
     It's the kids! They've come back for us!

  MCKAY
     Oh, I knew they were good kids. I knew it!
     (calling out) Down here! I knew you'd come back!
     Guys!

  ANNOTATION
     The two boys appear with two more boys.

  BOY THREE
     Oh!

  BOY ONE
     See? I told you they were down there.

  CARTER
     Are your parents up there? Did you bring help?

  BOY TWO
     No. Our friends didn't believe us. We bet them a
     week's supply of taffle that we were telling the
     truth.

  ANNOTATION
     He elbows Boy one.

  BOY THREE
     See? I told you not to!

  ANNOTATION
     The new boys look disappointed.

  MCKAY
     Where are the adults?

  BOY ONE
     We can't tell them! We'll get in trouble.

  MCKAY
     (furious) Trouble?! Now, you wait 'til I get out
     of here you little brats. I'll show you what
     trouble is!

  ANNOTATION
     The boys run away. There is another tremor, the
     biggest one so far.

  KELLER
     Tremor! We're moving!


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     The girders holding up their chamber buckle
     somewhat.


LOCATION--GENII MINING FACILITY CHAMBER

  CARTER
     We're tilting over!

  ANNOTATION
     The tremor ends, but the room is now tilted at a
     thirty degree angle.

  KELLER
     It stopped.

  CARTER
     The superstructure under this room must have
     buckled.

  MCKAY
     One more tremor...this whole chamber's going to
     fall into the chasm.

  ANNOTATION
     They stand at odd angles in the tilted room,
     looking upward.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Carter and Keller finish hanging lanterns
     in the room, as Carter notices McKay starting to
     swing the hook awkwardly.

  CARTER
     (nervously) Uh, do you want me to do that?

  MCKAY
     Nope. I can do it.

  CARTER
     Uh, well, it's just...have you ever done anything
     like this before?

  MCKAY
     (scoffing) What, like you have?

  CARTER
     Yes, actually. I have a bunch of times.

  MCKAY
     (with bravado) Yeah, well, I mean, so have I. You
     know, missions and such.

  CARTER
     (resigned) Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks away. Keller still stands staring at
     him.

  MCKAY
     You should probably...

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures where Carter is moving.

  KELLER
     Oh, right.

  ANNOTATION
     She joins Carter at the far end of the room.

  MCKAY
     All right.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay swings the rope around several times and
     releases it. The rope shoots directly towards
     Carter, who ducks as it sparks as it hits the
     metal wall behind her.

  CARTER
     McKay!

  MCKAY
     Sorry! Sorry.

  CARTER
     You just about took my head off!

  ANNOTATION
     She picks up the hook.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but I didn't mean to. It slipped.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks over with the hook. McKay reaches for
     it.

  MCKAY
     Let me do it.

  MCKAY
     I can do it.

  CARTER
     (low, stern) Apparently, you can't.

  MCKAY
     (low) I can do it! Just don't stand in front of
     me...or behind me.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter lets go, and she and Keller move behind
     some crates.

  MCKAY
     Okay! Okay...

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a deep breath and tosses the hook up. It
     doesn't go high enough and clatters back down.

  MCKAY
     See? Almost there.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller nods encouragingly as Carter watches
     patiently.

  KELLER
     You'll get it.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay pulls the hook away from where it embedded
     in a pipe in the floor. He doesn't notice the hole
     in the pipe or the gas escaping as he pulls it
     free.

  KELLER
     You can do this. This is the one. I can feel it.
     This is the one.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay swings and throws the hook. This time it
     almost makes it before coming back down. The spark
     it makes as it lands ignites the gas, causing a
     fire and a blast wave that knocks McKay down.
     Carter hurries to the pipe and the nearby shutoff
     valve.

  KELLER
     What are you doing?

  CARTER
     Stay there!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter tries to grasp the valve but it's too hot.
     She uses her jacket sleeves as protection as she
     turns the valve closed. Without fuel, the fire
     burns out. Keller heads for McKay, who's getting
     to his feet.

  KELLER
     Anything hurt?

  MCKAY
     No, it's just my pride.

  KELLER
     (comforting him) That'll heal.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs the hook and expertly spins and
     tosses it up. It hooks onto something on the
     ground above.

  KELLER
     You did it!

  MCKAY
     (flatly) Oh, great.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pulls on the rope to check how secure the
     line is. It doesn't give.

  CARTER
     All right. Here goes nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     As soon as she puts her full weight on the rope.
     The loose soil comes tumbling into the hole along
     with the rope. Carter dives for cover.

  CARTER
     Aw, nuts.

  ANNOTATION
     She tries again, but the same thing happens.

  CARTER
     There's no way the hook can grab onto that soil.

  KELLER
     (disappointed) All those knots...

  CARTER
     Well, we had to try. Any other ideas?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks up at the ceiling where the lamps are
     hanging. He snaps his fingers.

  MCKAY
     See those beams up there? We use the rope to get
     up there. That buys us at least ten feet. Then, we
     build a bridge, a bridge using... Using these.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls over some wooden planks.

  MCKAY
     Stack a couple of crates, we're golden. We got
     that high before.

  CARTER
     Yeah, but I don't think these are long enough to
     span the distance between these two beams.

  MCKAY
     So we...find a hammer and nails.

  CARTER
     (sarcastic) Sure. Why not just add a jet-pack and
     a trampoline to that list.

  MCKAY
     It is possible to find a hammer and nails.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to rummage the cupboards.

  KELLER
     We've been over the room pretty thoroughly.

  MCKAY
     (whining) But there's gotta be hammer and nails!

  CARTER
     Well, even if we found them...

  MCKAY
     Look, we just have to build a bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     They stare at the boards.

  KELLER
     (inspired) Wait a second. Wait a second. That bar
     bet!

  CARTER
     (blankly) Sorry?

  KELLER
     That dumb trick you do to get free beer.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay exchange baffled looks.

  MCKAY
     We-we don't know what you're talking about.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller demonstrates on a crate with three mess kit
     knives and metal cups set upon it.

  KELLER
     Bet goes like this. Using these three knives, and
     without moving these three cups, you need to build
     a bridge that can support another cup's weight.

  MCKAY
     We don't have another cup.

  KELLER
     Whatever. We'll use these.

  ANNOTATION
     She picks up a large roll of gauze tape.

  KELLER
     Okay. Now...see? Just like our boards...just a
     little too short to span the space between the two
     beams there.

  ANNOTATION
     She demonstrates how the knife can't reach fully
     to the other cup. A faint tremor rumbles in the
     distance.

  MCKAY
     Okay, you know what? We're geniuses, we could
     probably figure it out, but, uh, a little under
     the gun, so...

  KELLER
     Okay. Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller quickly lines up the three knives to each
     partially span the distance from each cup. The
     intersection of the knives forms a solid bridge,
     able to easily support the tape. Carter and McKay
     instantly move to the boards and study the beams
     to apply the principles.

  KELLER
     You owe me a beer, by the way.

  MCKAY
     Hey, if this works, I'll buy you a keg.

  ANNOTATION
     They use the rope to lever one board over the
     beam, Carter guiding the effort. As they continue
     to work, each of them ends up on a beam, working
     to intersect the boards. Finally, they're all in
     place. Carter tests its strength at the edge. It
     creaks, but holds her easily. McKay shoves up a
     crate. Carter and Keller move it into place on the
     center of the 3-piece bridge. When two crates are
     there, it's high enough for someone to reach the
     opening. Carter climbs onto the crates, but they
     creak dangerously.

  KELLER
     (worried) I knew this wasn't such a good idea.

  MCKAY
     (worried, from the ground below) Listen, I know I
     have a reputation for being overly pessimistic,
     but I really think you should come down right now
     before it all collapses.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter continues to climb.

  MCKAY
     Sam. Sam, just head back.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is able to touch the edge of the opening.

  CARTER
     I'm almost there.

  ANNOTATION
     There is another tremor.

  KELLER
     Oh no!

  ANNOTATION
     The shifting is enough to knock the boards out of
     sync. Carter and the crates fall all the way down.

  CARTER
     Whoa!

  KELLER
     Sam!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter lies on the ground, trying to clutch her
     leg. McKay rushes to her side.

  MCKAY
     Don't move! Don't move!

  ANNOTATION
     Keller clambers down from the beam as Carter
     groans in pain. Keller starts to examine her, but
     when she touches Carter's right leg, Carter
     screams in agony. Keller and McKay exchange looks.

  KELLER
     Your leg is broken.

  CARTER
     (gritting her teeth in pain) Oh! We're in trouble
     now, aren't we?

  MCKAY
     (without conviction) No, we'll be fine. We just,
     uh...we'll be fine.

  ANNOTATION
     A bit later, Keller comes back with her medical
     kit. Carter's trouser leg is pulled up to above
     her knee.

  KELLER
     (to McKay) Okay. Can you help me? Okay. One hand
     here, on her knee.

  CARTER
     Ow!

  KELLER
     One hand down here, on her ankle. Keep it nice and
     straight. (to Carter) You're not going to like
     this, but I gotta take your boot off.

  CARTER
     (with difficulty) Yeah, I thought you might.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller unlaces the boot while Carter braces
     herself.

  KELLER
     Okay. Here it comes.

  ANNOTATION
     She tugs the boot off while McKay holds the leg.
     Carter winces.

  CARTER
     Agh!

  ANNOTATION
     Keller quickly pulls off Carter's sock.

  KELLER
     Okay. Tell me when you can feel my finger on the
     bottom of your foot.

  CARTER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller starts to touch parts of Carter's foot.

  CARTER
     Yep...Yeah.

  KELLER
     Here?

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  KELLER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller reaches around and finds a small piece of
     wood from the broken crate.

  KELLER
     (to McKay) We need to find another one of
     these--make a splint.

  MCKAY
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     They both move away from Carter to search the
     room. McKay confronts Keller.

  MCKAY
     Look. How bad is she?

  KELLER
     Well, it's not so bad. She still has feeling in
     her foot, so there doesn't seem to be any nerve
     damage. But the break's pretty severe, which means
     there may very well be internal bleeding.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but that's--I mean, that's...bad, isn't it?

  KELLER
     Well, it's not really good, no. I mean...I would
     need to get her under a scanner.

  MCKAY
     Okay, worst case scenario. She's bleeding
     internally. How long has she got before
     she...before it becomes very serious?

  KELLER
     (reluctantly) An hour.

  MCKAY
     Oh, boy.

  KELLER
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes her found board and heads back over to
     Carter.

  CARTER
     So, what? Hour before internal bleeding becomes a
     problem?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller looks at McKay, who looks stunned.

  MCKAY
     How did you..?

  CARTER
     It's not my first rodeo, Rodney.

  KELLER
     Here's some ibuprofen.

  MCKAY
     (aghast) Ibuprofen?! That's the strongest thing
     you've got?!

  KELLER
     It's all I have in this basic kit. Although, from
     this point on, I think I'm making morphine
     mandatory...as well as maybe a grappling gun.

  CARTER
     I wouldn't take the morphine. Got to keep a clear
     head. We still have to figure a way out of here...
     (hisses) At least one of us does. Chances are
     pretty slim that I'm going to...climb out. Ow.

  ANNOTATION
     She winces as Keller sets the leg.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well the crates are out.

  CARTER
     Yep.

  MCKAY
     (to Keller) Hey, if you got an idea, feel free.

  KELLER
     Hey, I came up with the bar trick thing, okay? And
     that didn't work out so well, so I think I'll
     just...leave it to the pros.

  MCKAY
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks to Carter hopefully, who's fighting back
     tears.

  CARTER
     Sorry. All my energy's focused on not screaming in
     agony.

  MCKAY
     Wonderful.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller gets up to find something to pillow
     Carter's head.

  MCKAY
     Okay. Well, the grappling hook because the hook
     wouldn't hold our weight in the soil. The crates
     didn't work because Sam was too heavy, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter glares at McKay.

  MCKAY
     (backpedaling) Oh...we all would've been. I
     mean...our weight in general. It had nothing to do
     with you. It just...you...I mean, you're in very
     good shape. Seriously, you have, like the perfect
     body.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller returns to Carter's side with some blankets
     she rolls up, and glares at McKay.

  MCKAY
     Oh! Not that you don't! Oh, no, no, no. I realize
     that your bodies are different, and-and-and, uh
     maybe-maybe that that would mean that I think that
     your body is imperfect, but that is not the case.
     No, no, no. Far, far-far from it--that--that is, a
     sweet...uh, which is to say...I mean, it would be
     impossible for me to choose which of you--

  CARTER
     (annoyed, and pained) Rest assured, you're never
     gonna have to.

  KELLER
     (drily) Aw, if we'd kept quiet, I bet he would've
     gone on like that forever.

  MCKAY
     Okay, I'm sorry. What I mean is-is that you have--

  CARTER
     (sternly) Rodney. Stay on topic.

  MCKAY
     Right. Okay, uh, right...where was I? Uh...All
     right, look...if we can get this rod up there,
     attach the rope to it, it'll lay across the
     hole--support our weight. We won't have to worry
     about the soil.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows a long thin metal piece of rebar.

  KELLER
     (dubious) You were barely able to get the
     grappling hook up there.

  MCKAY
     (defensively) Barely? Were you not watching? It
     was--

  CARTER
     (interrupting) It's just that...it's a lot heavier
     than that.

  MCKAY
     So...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks around and spots the pipe that had the
     gas fire.

  MCKAY
     (inspired) A detonator. I need a detonator.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, McKay begins setting up pieces of the pipe
     like a cannon, placing a detonator inside and
     activating it.

  MCKAY
     Just place the detonator inside the tube...Now...

  ANNOTATION
     He moves the heavy piece over to the other pipe,
     where Keller has been working with some wet wadded
     up cloth over the broken part of the leak. They
     place the detonator pipe at an angle over the
     cloth.

  MCKAY
     We have to seal the bottom of the tube around the
     gas leak, like so...

  ANNOTATION
     While Keller holds up the heavy pipe, McKay puts
     more cloth around where the two pipes meet.

  MCKAY
     All right, so, put the wadding and the rod in the
     barrel...

  ANNOTATION
     Keller finishes stuffing the "cannon" with more
     cloth. The cannon is now tied to the pipe with the
     climbing rope. McKay stuffs in the rod, which has
     a thin small rope attached to it.

  MCKAY
     And then, "gently" create a seal. We don't want to
     pack it too tight, otherwise we've got ourselves a
     pipe bomb. But, if we play it right, our very own
     cannon.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller starts stuffing more wadding inside.

  KELLER
     You really think this is going to work?

  MCKAY
     It should.

  KELLER
     (skeptical) You can build a cannon just like that?

  MCKAY
     (scoffing) Please, we've got access to pressurized
     gas. It's a cinch. You should have seen my Grade
     Six science project. I actually had to create--

  ANNOTATION
     Carter rolls her eyes from where she's barely
     sitting up at the far wall.

  CARTER
     (chiding weakly) Rodney.

  MCKAY
     (contrite) Right. Okay. Yeah. So...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay takes position next to the cannon. Keller
     holds the cannon steady.

  MCKAY
     Ready?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller nods. McKay opens the valve. After several
     few seconds, he closes it again.

  MCKAY
     All right, okay. And...are we ready?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakes her head, then nods, looking scared.

  KELLER
     (nervously) Ready.

  MCKAY
     Fire in the hole.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay fires the detonator, wincing. The cannon
     shoots the rod straight up through the hole into
     the sky above.

  MCKAY
     Nice aim!

  KELLER
     Nice cannon.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay unties the end of the rope from where it's
     attached to a crate. There is barely any slack.

  MCKAY
     That went really far.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts pulling back the rope. Some dirt starts
     falling into the hole. They duck as more falls in.

  CARTER
     Uh, McKay?

  KELLER
     Aah!

  CARTER
     You should stop. There's too much dirt coming in.
     The room's going to get too heavy!

  MCKAY
     I've almost got it!

  ANNOTATION
     As McKay pulls, there is another tremor. They try
     to keep their footing.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     One of the girders totally gives way, angling the
     precarious chamber even more. The door flies open
     and Keller falls. She grabs onto the rope as she
     falls out of the room, clinging to it as she
     swings over the abyss below with a scream.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay has hold of one end of the rope, wrapped
     around his arm. He's holding on, taking all the
     weight as he slides into one of the beams in the
     room.

  CARTER
     Jennifer!


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller swings several feet below the chamber.

  KELLER
     Down here! Rodney, don't let go!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay renews his efforts to keep hold. The angle
     of the room is now much steeper.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter struggles over to the door to find Keller,
     who is nearly sobbing below.


LOCATION--MINING CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is able to peek over the edge and see
     Keller swinging below.

  KELLER
     Rodney, don't let go!

  CARTER
     Rodney...?


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  MCKAY
     (straining) Sam, I can't hold this.

  CARTER
     Yes, you can!

  MCKAY
     (panicked) No, no. I've never been very good at
     holding heavy things. I had an old lady's grocery
     cart when I was in college. It's one of the
     reasons I didn't date as much as I should have.

  CARTER
     (rolling her eyes) Stay focused! You need to pull
     her up.

  MCKAY
     (rolling his eyes) Oh, really? I was just-just
     getting used to the idea of not letting go!

  CARTER
     She can't hang there forever, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Well, help me!

  CARTER
     Rodney, I can't help you. I can't even stand up.
     You're going to have to pull her up on your own.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay backs away from the beam, trying to get into
     position to pull. He is able to pull her up a few
     inches.


LOCATION--MINING CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller yelps as the rope shifts.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay continues to pull, grunting.


LOCATION--MINING CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller, spinning as she moves, spots a light to
     the left of the chamber further down the chasm.

  KELLER
     Wait-wait-wait-wait! Don't pull me up!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  MCKAY
     (shocked) What?! Why?

  KELLER
     I see light!

  MCKAY
     (panicked) No, no, no, no! Don't go towards the
     light! You want to stay in the land of the living!


LOCATION--MINING CHASM

  KELLER
     No, daylight! There's a-there's a mine shaft down
     here! I see daylight!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  CARTER
     Of course! Just like the ones on the other side of
     the mine. We should've thought of that!

  MCKAY
     (straining) Okay, guys, what do you want me to
     do?! What do I do?!

  KELLER
     Lower me!

  MCKAY
     Wha--Lower you?!

  KELLER
     It's about ten feet away. I just-I just need to
     swing over.

  MCKAY
     What if the mine shaft is harder to get out of
     than this chamber?

  CARTER
     We already lost our exit, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Huh?

  ANNOTATION
     He looks up. The shifting angle of the mine
     chamber has now blocked the hole. Solid dirt is
     above them now.

  KELLER
     I'll take my chances! Just lower me! I can't hold
     on forever!

  MCKAY
     (grunting) You and me both.

  ANNOTATION
     He slowly lowers her.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller is lowered to a point even with the shaft
     opening.

  KELLER
     Okay, good, stop!

  MCKAY
     Gladly!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter watches as Keller starts a controlled swing
     over to the shaft opening.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  CARTER
     You're doing great, Rodney. You're doing just
     great!

  MCKAY
     No, "great" is a beach with a fiber-optic hook-up.
     This, this is complete agony!


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller is able to gain a foothold at the chasm.
     She grabs hold of the wall with one arm and with
     effort gets steady footing at the shaft.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay falls on his back as he suddenly has no
     pressure at the other end of the rope.

  KELLER
     I made it!

  MCKAY
     You could have warned me.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller moves into the shaft a ways and looks up.
     She comes back to the opening to call up.

  KELLER
     This thing leads straight out! It's a nice steady
     slope! C'mon, you guys gotta get down here!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Carter slides back to the door and nods to McKay,
     who is holding his hands away from his body.

  CARTER
     You go.

  MCKAY
     (incredulous) What? No way.

  CARTER
     There's no way I'm going to be able to lower
     myself.

  MCKAY
     You won't have to. I-I'll lower you.

  CARTER
     Rodney, your hands...

  ANNOTATION
     Panting, McKay looks down at his trembling hands.
     They are covered with blood from holding the rope.

  MCKAY
     Look, I'm not leaving you behind. Come on...I'll
     make you a seat.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sits on a board that's been attached to the
     rope. She's being lowered down. Over her arm is
     coiled the bottom half of the rope.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay has wound the rope around a couple of the
     beams as makeshift pulleys to help control the
     rope's descent.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter continues to be lowered. The jerking
     movement jars her injured leg.

  CARTER
     Ah!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay winces in pain as his hands continue to
     lower the rope. He's got them wrapped in the
     cloth, but it's not much protection.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is even with the shaft opening.

  CARTER
     Okay, that's good. Stop!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  MCKAY
     Stopping!

  ANNOTATION
     He grips the rope to try and keep her steady.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter tosses the coiled rope to Keller who
     catches it and starts to reel her over.

  KELLER
     Okay. Almost there. Just give me a few more feet
     of slack!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, in pain, tries to grasp the wall as she
     nears to help Keller get her in.


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay slowly lets the rope down more.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is able to sit in the mine and Keller has a
     good hold on her shoulder, certain she won't fall
     into the shaft.

  KELLER
     Okay, I got her!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs in relief and lets go of the rope,
     standing at an angle to remain upright.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks exhausted and pained.

  KELLER
     You're up, McKay!


LOCATION--GENII MINING CHAMBER

  MCKAY
     (sarcastic) Oh, great. Great. You know what I was
     just thinking? What would be awesome? Would be
     more physical exertion!

  ANNOTATION
     He bows his head as he tries to catch his breath.


LOCATION--MINE CHASM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay is on the rope and hanging even with the
     shaft opening, but remains still, with his back to
     the others.

  KELLER
     Come on now. Start swinging.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay doesn't move.

  KELLER
     Rodney, you have to use your body and start
     swinging. Come on. You're so close!

  MCKAY
     (shivering) No. Used everything I got to get this
     far.

  KELLER
     So that's it, then? You-you're quitting? You're
     just going to die there on the rope?

  MCKAY
     (firmly) No. No, I'm just taking a little rest.

  ANNOTATION
     Grimacing, he starts to swing a little. The rope
     starts to fray where it rubs against the broken
     opening of the mining chamber.

  MCKAY
     (mumbling) You know, I'm like...like a real life
     action star, kind of...

  KELLER
     What?

  MCKAY
     (exhausted) You know, shooting guns...running
     around...saving people. You'd think it'd
     be...you'd think this would be easy for me by now.
     You think I'd be, like, super-buff by now.

  KELLER
     Okay, come on, Schwarzenegger, start swingin'.

  MCKAY
     Just a second more.

  ANNOTATION
     There is an ominous groaning from the chamber
     girders.

  MCKAY
     Okay, break's over.

  ANNOTATION
     Panting, he starts to swing back and forth. After
     two tries, he tries to reach, but it's not enough.
     Unbeknownst to them, the rope continues to fray,
     now faster. Finally, McKay is able to grab
     Keller's arm. She pulls him in just as the rope
     snaps. They both fall into the shaft at the lack
     of tension.

  MCKAY
     (breathless) That was close.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a loud rumbling. The entire mining
     chamber they had been trapped in passes by and
     falls into the chasm far below with a loud crunch.

  MCKAY
     Correction...that was close.

  KELLER
     (nodding) Okay. Come on. You need to help me.

  ANNOTATION
     They both move toward Carter.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DUSK


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller sit next to each other on an
     infirmary bed, now cleaned and in clean uniforms.
     Keller's hands are bandaged and she's looking over
     another staff person's chart. McKay is still
     having his hands tended to by a doctor.

  KELLER
     (to staff member) Looks good. Okay, thank you.

  MCKAY
     How's Sam?

  KELLER
     (smiling) She's going to be okay. It's a clean
     break, so they're resetting it and putting her
     into a cast, which means she's going to be on
     crutches for a few weeks or so, but--

  ANNOTATION
     The doctor working on McKay finishes and pats him
     reassuringly on the arm before leaving.

  KELLER
     (to doctor) Thank you. (to McKay) --She's going to
     be fine. How are you doing?

  MCKAY
     I'd like to take a bath in whatever magical
     ointment they just put on my hands, 'cause they
     are the only thing that doesn't hurt. It's not
     going to scar, is it?

  KELLER
     Chicks dig scars.

  MCKAY
     Not the chicks I dig.

  KELLER
     You're going to be fine.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay nods.

  KELLER
     Thanks, by the way.

  MCKAY
     (surprised) For what?

  KELLER
     You saved my life. If you had let go...

  MCKAY
     (embarrassed) Ah, you're welcome. (takes deep
     breath) Right, well, I'm going back to my room,
     curling up in the fetal position, and sleeping for
     the next three days.

  KELLER
     Oh, well, not quite yet.

  MCKAY
     Hmm?

  KELLER
     You owe me a beer...from the bar trick thing
     earlier. You couldn't figure it out, so...

  MCKAY
     (defensively) There was no time! I would've
     figured it out.

  KELLER
     Yeah, well eventually, I mean, chimps would have
     been able to figure it out. But the thing is, you
     didn't. So I win, and you owe me a beer.

  MCKAY
     (petulant) I don't remember ever agreeing to the
     beer.

  KELLER
     (impatient) McKay?

  MCKAY
     What?

  KELLER
     Do you want to have a drink with me or not?

  MCKAY
     Oh...you-you want to have to have a drink?

  ANNOTATION
     He stares at her bemused as he realizes the
     implications.

  KELLER
     (amused) God, you're not very good at this, are
     you.

  MCKAY
     Uh, no. No, I'm not.

  ANNOTATION
     She laughs and hops off the bed, grabbing his arm.

  KELLER
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay smiles as they walk out.
