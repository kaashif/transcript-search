<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>MCKAY: The one with the frequent tremors.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>KELLER: Not to mention an abnormally high amount of people with debilitating respiratory problems.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>MCKAY: (dismissive) It's a mining planet. It's not that surprising.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>KELLER: Not everybody worked in the mines, Rodney.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>MCKAY: They're experiencing upwards of four tremors a day. My seismic team has concluded that the area where they've built their settlement is dangerously unstable. So--</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>KELLER: (smirking) Well, obviously, it wasn't enough for them. Anyway, these people said they've experienced tremors for as long as they can remember.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>MCKAY: Yes, and I'm pretty sure they've been breathing even longer. So again, my problem trumps yours.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>CARTER: This is not a contest! Obviously, they're living in a settlement that's not safe for habitation. You need to convince them to move to another part of the continent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Twenty years ago, the Genii kind of took over the planet--employed them all as miners.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>MCKAY: Haven't a clue. Whatever it was, they cleaned out the deposits and left.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>MCKAY: Well, did you see this? That's not going to budge unless we enter the right code. Look, these symbols are Genii numerals.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>KELLER: Yeah, but...you can crack the code, though, right?</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>CARTER: (as McKay speaks) Well, it would be a lot easier...</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>MCKAY: (as Carter speaks) Yeah, it'd be a lot easier...</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>MCKAY: (patronizing) What, you think maybe there's a scary monster back there?</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>KELLER: No. But this is a mining facility, and who knows what kind of toxins are in there. Like you said: "Red means bad."</td></tr>

<tr id="L110"><td><a href="#L110">110</a></td><td>CARTER: Well... (shrugging) I'm willing to take the chance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L111"><td><a href="#L111">111</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Carter and McKay push open the door, which opens outwards. McKay holds Carter back before she falls.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They stare out into a deep chasm. Other chambers are on the far side, held up by metal girders. A catwalk that bridged the chasm between their chamber and the others has fallen apart, and there is nothing on the other side of the door.</td></tr>
