<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>MCKAY: I'm not entirely sure. It looks like Sheppard's jumper was attacked before it could reach the space gate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>MCKAY: Well, the people on the planet aren't much past mud huts and blow darts, so I think we can assume they had nothing to do with it. What we do know that just before we lost contact, there was a short burst of radiation in the vicinity of the 'gate, consistent with the opening of a hyperspace window.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>RONON: Wraith?</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>MCKAY: Sheppard didn't seem to think so, and what little sensor data we've been able to pick up from the jumper seems to confirm it. The energy signature's all wrong. It's inconsistent with Ancient technology as well, which pretty much rules out the Replicators.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>LARRIN: When you've spent as much time in space as we do, you don't get a lot of fresh food.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Sheppard picks up a gelatinous oblong shaped piece of food and dangles it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Larrin tilts her head, but says nothing. Sheppard drops the food back onto the tray.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Well, no offense, uh, Larrin, but it doesn't sound like much of a life.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Larrin stands and gets something to drink.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>LARRIN: Being a herd animal isn't much of a life. Besides, the food has all the nutrients required.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Well, as tempting as that sounds...my jaw is a little sore right now.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>LARRIN: Things like that are necessary from time to time. Although it's not the most efficient way of getting information, it does help people to understand...their situation.</td></tr>

However, if you continue to play ignorant with me, I really will jettison you out into space. For some time now, we've been hearing rumors about a new group of humans in the galaxy using the technology of the Ancestors to do battle with the Wraith. So, we set up a network of spy satellites around dozens of worlds with space gates, hoping for an encounter. Eventually we got lucky.</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: And in the first meeting between our people, you attack me and disarm my ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>LARRIN: Well, you were going through the 'gate, and I couldn't let that happen. You see, anyone capable of operating Lantian technology is of particular interest to us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: That's why you took a sample of my blood.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>LARRIN: We're working on a control interface adaptor that requires a small amount of necessary genetic material. We needed your blood to test it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L142"><td><a href="#L142">142</a></td><td>NEVIK: They were attacked by the Wraith. They lost communication, and their shields were failing. The engines were damaged as well but they managed to escape into hyperspace. Then they realized that their main drive was giving off deadly radiation. They were forced to abandon ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L143"><td><a href="#L143">143</a></td><td>LARRIN: They intended to return and affect repairs but never got the chance. The ship's been drifting in a two hundred year elliptical orbit around a nearby dwarf star ever since.</td></tr>
