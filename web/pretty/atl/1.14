LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS

  ANNOTATION
     A Puddle Jumper speeds around the planet. Wraith
     darts pursue the craft.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard flies the Jumper, the rest of the team
     with him.

  SHEPPARD
     I count two. How about you?

  FORD
     Yes, sir. I recommend shooting back any time now.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm trying. That hit must've caused some damage.
     McKay?

  MCKAY
     I'm on it.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gets up to work on the panels in the aft of
     the Jumper.

  TEYLA
     Where did they come from?

  MCKAY
     She's right. The darts are short-range fighters.
     There's probably a hive ship around here
     somewhere.

  TEYLA
     Then we need to get out of here.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, we do.

  FORD
     The Stargate is the other way, sir, on the other
     side of the planet.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we're taking the scenic route. McKay!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jumper fires weapons forward.

  MCKAY
     I'm almost there!

  FORD
     There's one on our tail!

  SHEPPARD
     Thank you, I know all about that one. Keep your
     eye on the other one.

  MCKAY
     Okay, you should have weapons now.

  SHEPPARD
     Negative.

  MCKAY
     Are you sure?

  SHEPPARD
     Positive!

  MCKAY
     I'm pretty sure I fixed it.

  ANNOTATION
     A dart flies past the Jumper.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, obviously you didn't!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jumper is hit by a dart weapon.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps we can lose them in the atmosphere of the
     planet.

  FORD
     Two more darts on our two o'clock.

  SHEPPARD
     I see them. McKay!

  MCKAY
     It's not like I'm holding back on you.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS

  ANNOTATION
     A huge ball of light energy emits from the planet
     and envelops and destroys the darts behind the
     Jumper. It begins to follow the Jumper.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     Hang on!

  ANNOTATION
     The energy passes over the Jumper, jolting but not
     damaging it.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS

  ANNOTATION
     The energy ball moves away.

  TEYLA
     The Wraith darts have been destroyed.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that's a good thing.

  MCKAY
     (walking forward, breathless) I thought for sure
     we were dead. Didn't you think we were dead?

  FORD
     What the hell was that?

  MCKAY
     Some sort of uh, energy weapon?

  SHEPPARD
     What do you say we find out?

  MCKAY
     Yeah.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS

  ANNOTATION
     The Jumper de-orbits toward the planet.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  MCKAY
     So just to confirm, we're all still...definitely
     not dead.

  TEYLA
     I feel very much alive.

  MCKAY
     Good. Same here.

  SHEPPARD
     I wish I knew what that was.

  FORD
     Looked like lightning.

  SHEPPARD
     Space lightning?

  MCKAY
     I already said, it's some sort of an energy
     weapon, one that apparently destroys Wraith darts.

  FORD
     Nice, but why them and not us?

  MCKAY
     Well assuming that we're still alive, and there
     doesn't appear to be any damage as a result of the
     pulse, I think we can safely conclude that, uh...
     um... um... I got nothing. I mean, I got nothing
     to conclude. I'm just talking for the sake of
     talking.

  SHEPPARD
     You sure you're okay?

  MCKAY
     You know how much I hate certain death?

  SHEPPARD
     You're alive.

  TEYLA
     Could something like that be naturally occurring?

  SHEPPARD
     My money's on non-naturally occurring.

  FORD
     Like a weapon the Ancients left behind?

  SHEPPARD
     Any weapon that impressive would have to be
     powered by--

  MCKAY
     A Zero-Point Module.

  SHEPPARD
     That's right.

  MCKAY
     All right, we need to get down there.

  SHEPPARD
     I've got to put down and check for damage anyways,
     before we head back to Atlantis.


LOCATION--PROCULIS

  ANNOTATION
     The Jumper skims along above trees and a creek.


LOCATION--OUTSIDE VILLAGE ON PROCULIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Ford looks at a primitive village through
     binoculars. The huts are made of wood and straw,
     with no sign of technology. Several children are
     visible.

  FORD
     If there is a weapon somewhere down here, sir,
     these folks didn't build it.

  SHEPPARD
     Not these kids. You picking up anything?

  MCKAY
     I'm picking up everything, just nothing worth
     mentioning.

  SHEPPARD
     These folks look familiar to you, Teyla?

  TEYLA
     The Stargate is in orbit, Major. My people could
     never have ventured here.

  SHEPPARD
     Right. What say we venture?


LOCATION--VILLAGE ON PROCULIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers are young and fit, dressed in
     tropical, tribal clothing, with bone necklaces and
     tattoos. Sheppard and the team approach
     cautiously, and people turn to look at them.

  SHEPPARD
     Hi.

  ANNOTATION
     One villager, dressed in a red robe, runs toward a
     structure. Sheppard speaks to the others.

  SHEPPARD
     It's okay. We're friendly. Hi.

  TEYLA
     It is likely they have never seen anyone from
     outside their village.

  ANNOTATION
     As the walk to the center, the villagers follow
     them, curious. An older man in a red robe comes
     out of the structure where the first man had gone.

  ZARAH
     Welcome. I am Zarah, one of the Abbots of
     Proculis.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm John. John Sheppard. This is Teyla, Lieutenant
     Ford, and Dr. McKay.

  ZARAH
     Please, come.

  ANNOTATION
     He ushers them to a thatched hut. The kneel around
     a low table.

  ZARAH
     This is the first time--at least in my own
     lifetime--that people from another land have come
     to us.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we came by ship. A flying...thing that
     allows us to move from one world to another.

  ZARAH
     (shocked) Another world?

  TEYLA
     From among the stars you see in the night sky. We
     are peaceful explorers.

  ZARAH
     Then glory to Athar for bringing you here safely.

  FORD
     Athar?

  ZARAH
     The provider...and protector of all. Surely you
     know.

  TEYLA
     Athar is known by many names among the stars.

  MCKAY
     Is, um...Athar around? We'd love to talk to him.
     We're, uh, friends.

  ZARAH
     Athar is friend to all, and with us always. Even
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     He closes his eyes and presses his hands together.

  MCKAY
     Of course. Hi, Athar.

  ANNOTATION
     Zarah looks at McKay in confusion.

  TEYLA
     What Dr. McKay means is that we wish to offer our
     thanks. We were attacked by the Wraith and would
     have been killed, were it not for Athar's
     intervention.

  ZARAH
     "Wraith"?

  SHEPPARD
     Pale skin, sunken eyes, suck the life out of you
     with their hands?

  ZARAH
     We have never encountered such beings.

  FORD
     Never?

  TEYLA
     And there is no mention of them in your history?

  ZARAH
     None. I can assure you that for many thousands of
     years, we have lived here in peace.

  SHEPPARD
     Could you excuse us for a moment?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard starts to get up, but Zarah interrupts.

  ZARAH
     Of course. Please, I must tell the other abbots of
     your arrival before we go to meet with Chaya.

  SHEPPARD
     Chaya is...

  ZARAH
     The high priestess of Athar. This is a great day
     for our people.

  ANNOTATION
     Zarah leaves. Many villagers look into the hut.

  SHEPPARD
     Ours too. (to the team) I'm not kidding. This
     could really work.

  TEYLA
     I agree, Major. Every inhabited world I have
     encountered in this galaxy has been ravaged by the
     Wraith.

  MCKAY
     Well, this planet is protected by an Ancient
     weapon. This just confirms it.

  FORD
     Does it?

  MCKAY
     Well, there's no other explanation. I mean, the
     power requirements of something like that must be
     astronomical. Only a ZPM could generate that.

  TEYLA
     And yet, they do not appear to be technologically
     advanced.

  FORD
     Unless that guy was lying. But he doesn't seem
     like the lying type.

  SHEPPARD
     So, automated defenses?

  TEYLA
     Imagine a world where displaced refugees from
     dozens of planets could come and live in peace
     without fear of being culled by the Wraith.

  FORD
     Maybe we can negotiate some kind of treaty.

  MCKAY
     We just need access to that weapon--better still,
     the ZPM--not that we'd steal it or anything.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's just try to stay on our best behavior.

  MCKAY
     I'm always on my best behavior.


LOCATION--PROCULIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The team walk across an open field, escorted by
     three abbots.

  MCKAY
     How much farther?

  ZARAH
     Not very.

  MCKAY
     Oh, good. See, we could have taken the jumper.

  FORD
     The exercise is good for you.

  SHEPPARD
     Chaya does live pretty far from your people.

  TEYLA
     It is not uncommon, Major, for clerics to live
     apart from the community.


LOCATION--CHAYA'S TEMPLE

  ANNOTATION
     A beautiful woman, Chaya tends plants in her
     courtyard. The abbots and Sheppard's team arrive.
     Chaya approaches them.

  ZARAH
     Glory to Athar.

  CHAYA
     Welcome, and rest.

  ZARAH
     Thank you, sister.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is open-mouthed in shock at seeing Chaya.

  CHAYA
     You are new to Proculis.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes. We're, uh...we're brand new, in fact. Major
     John Sheppard.

  ANNOTATION
     He shakes her hand. McKay gives Ford a look.

  CHAYA
     I am called Chaya Sar. And you are...Teyla,
     Lieutenant Ford and Dr. McKay.

  FORD
     How did she know that?

  MCKAY
     Oh, please. One of the abbots ran ahead.

  SHEPPARD
     It's a pleasure to meet you, Chaya.

  CHAYA
     You must be tired after your long journey. Shall I
     prepare some tea for us?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I was hoping you were going to say just
     that.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, they all share tea, seated around a table
     in the courtyard.

  CHAYA
     And where do they come from, these Wraith?

  SHEPPARD
     They seem to be everywhere in this galaxy, and
     they appear to have been on top of the food chain
     for a long time.

  CHAYA
     It's terrifying. Truly terrifying. My heart goes
     out to your people, Teyla.

  TEYLA
     It is not only my people who suffer, Chaya. The
     Wraith have awakened from a long sleep, and this
     entire world is safe from the culling that has
     already begun. Even Atlantis with all its wonder,
     may not survive the onslaught. It is our hope that
     Athar could grant sanctuary here on Proculis.

  CHAYA
     Sanctuary? For so many?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we're not talking about everybody in the
     galaxy showing up at your doorstep.

  FORD
     This planet is pretty big, ma'am.

  TEYLA
     And it is largely uninhabited.

  MCKAY
     More importantly, it is protected by that weapon
     of yours.

  CHAYA
     Weapon? I am aware of no such thing on Proculis.

  SHEPPARD
     Are you sure about that?

  CHAYA
     Yes.

  MCKAY
     Oh, please.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney, best behavior.

  MCKAY
     This is as good as it gets, Major. Chaya, the only
     reason we're alive is because of a powerful energy
     weapon that emanated from somewhere on the surface
     of this planet. It destroyed the ships that were
     shooting at us. That weapon is what's keeping the
     Wraith away.

  CHAYA
     No, Dr. McKay. It was Athar who protected you.

  MCKAY
     Athar?

  CHAYA
     Yes. Athar saw you were in need.

  SHEPPARD
     Chaya, there are a lot of people just like...you
     and me, who are in need because of the Wraith.
     What you have here--what Athar has provided
     you--is a very rare thing... But we have a lot to
     offer, too. That's what friends do--they share. I
     think we could help each other.

  CHAYA
     I understand. I shall consult with her now.

  ANNOTATION
     She stands, as do the others.

  CHAYA
     Please stay here. I don't know how long this will
     take.

  SHEPPARD
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves, followed by the abbots.

  MCKAY
     "What Athar provides for you?" What, are you
     buying into this?

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney...what religious people don't take their
     religion seriously?

  MCKAY
     We didn't imagine that weapon, Major. We saw it
     with our own eyes, and we saw what it was capable
     of.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, we did.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps Chaya is simply unaware of the weapon's
     existence.

  FORD
     Or she knows, and she wants to keep it a secret
     from us.

  SHEPPARD
     She doesn't strike me as the lying type, either.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay huffs derisively.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, let's just see what Athar has to stay.

  MCKAY
     So, "Pay no attention to the man behind the
     curtain," hmm?

  SHEPPARD
     Exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard lies down on a bench.

  ANNOTATION
     Sometime later, Chaya returns with the abbots.

  CHAYA
     Major. We have conveyed your request to our Divine
     Mother, and although she does not doubt the
     righteousness of your mission, I'm afraid she
     cannot countenance any other people but hers
     settling here.

  MCKAY
     And you really had to chant all that time to come
     up with that?

  SHEPPARD
     McKay.

  TEYLA
     Is there any way we can ask Athar to reconsider?

  CHAYA
     Athar understands and sympathizes--these Wraith
     are a scourge among our stars--but she has to
     place the lives of her people first.

  MCKAY
     Well, I think we both knew what you were going to
     say long before you even went in there.

  CHAYA
     We prayed for Athar's guidance.

  MCKAY
     And what did Athar say? You're hiding behind your
     religion to justify your complete and utter
     selfishness.

  SHEPPARD
     (sternly) Rodney...

  MCKAY
     If Athar existed, she would be ashamed of herself.

  ZARAH
     We ask only to be left alone and in peace.

  MCKAY
     So untold thousands, possibly millions of people
     will die out there when they could have been
     saved, all in the name of Athar. How very, very
     peaceful of you.

  CHAYA
     You should be grateful to Athar.

  MCKAY
     This is a waste of time.

  CHAYA
     Athar regrets that she cannot help you.

  MCKAY
     And I'm sure those were her exact words.

  SHEPPARD
     That's enough! Head back to the jumper. I'll be
     there in a minute.

  MCKAY
     Why?

  SHEPPARD
     Because you're not helping.

  FORD
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford, Teyla and McKay leave.

  SHEPPARD
     I apologize.

  CHAYA
     He acts only in accordance to his beliefs, as do
     we.

  SHEPPARD
     But Rodney is right about one thing. This really
     is about lives--human lives. Sooner or later the
     Wraith are going to show up at Atlantis, and when
     they do--

  CHAYA
     You're a warrior.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I don't know about "warrior."

  CHAYA
     It is your vocation, Major. You will fight.

  SHEPPARD
     I'll try, but knowing what we're up against, and
     the odds... Look, I'd appreciate it if you would
     ask Athar to consider that we are her people. Even
     though we come from very far away, we're the same.
     We're human, which means we're not strangers.
     We're family.

  ANNOTATION
     A strong breeze blows through the courtyard.

  SHEPPARD
     Whoa.

  CHAYA
     Evening breeze.

  SHEPPARD
     I was kind of hoping it was a sign from Athar.

  CHAYA
     Your words are most compelling, Major Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     Thank you. I was going for compelling.

  CHAYA
     Do you truly believe we are family?

  SHEPPARD
     We are. I can prove it to you.

  CHAYA
     How?

  SHEPPARD
     Come back to Atlantis. See who we really are. Once
     Athar learns more about us--

  CHAYA
     This is acceptable.

  SHEPPARD
     It is?

  ZARAH
     (alarmed) Chaya, please, you cannot leave.

  CHAYA
     Athar is with us always, no matter where we are,
     Zarah.

  ANNOTATION
     The breeze comes up again; she places her hand on
     Zarah's chest. He calms down.

  ZARAH
     I understand.

  CHAYA
     I am ready.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Chaya has arrived. Weir greets her. Teyla and
     Rodney look on, Rodney appearing very skeptical.

  WEIR
     Welcome to Atlantis.

  CHAYA
     Thank you.

  WEIR
     I hope you don't mind, but our doctors do require
     a medical exam of all off-planet team members and
     our visitors. But after that, perhaps you'd like a
     full tour.

  CHAYA
     I would love that.

  TEYLA
     Major Sheppard has already promised to do so.

  WEIR
     (brightly) Of course he has.

  SHEPPARD
     Of course I have.

  WEIR
     Please, if you'll follow me to the infirmary...

  MCKAY
     Maybe I should tag along, in case you have any
     questions--

  SHEPPARD
     I think I've got it handled, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     There are a lot of systems you know absolutely--

  SHEPPARD
     Got it covered.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Weir, and Chaya walk away.

  MCKAY
     Fine.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Chaya gets scanned by the Ancient scanner; Beckett
     watches the results on a laptop.

  BECKETT
     Hold still. Just a minute more. Well, my dear, it
     seems you're just as lovely on the inside as you
     are on the out, if health is synonymous with
     beauty. You can get up now.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits up.

  CHAYA
     How does this device do what you say it does?

  BECKETT
     It creates images of the tissues inside your body,
     and they are picture-perfect.

  CHAYA
     Did you bring these machines back from your world?

  BECKETT
     Some. Others are Atlantean technology that we've
     figured out how to use, and a few...well, I
     haven't the vaguest idea of what they do.
     Hopefully one day I'll have a chance to meet one.
     I'll ask them myself.

  CHAYA
     Do you know what happened to them?

  BECKETT
     Well, some returned to Earth after the war with
     the Wraith. That much we know, but we also know
     that some of them ascended.

  CHAYA
     Ascended?

  BECKETT
     To a higher plane, where they exist only as
     energy. Are all the people of your world as
     healthy as you?

  CHAYA
     Yes.

  BECKETT
     No disease, ailments? No one ever breaks a leg?

  CHAYA
     Such things are rare, but my people heal quite
     rapidly.

  BECKETT
     Really?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard enters.

  SHEPPARD
     Are we done?

  CHAYA
     Are we?

  BECKETT
     Healthiest patient I've ever had. Off you go,
     love.

  ANNOTATION
     She pats Beckett on the shoulder as she passes,
     then takes Sheppard arm, and they leave.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and McKay walk from her office down to the
     gate room.

  WEIR
     Where are we at?

  MCKAY
     Well, either she knows where the weapon is and
     she's playing us, or else she has no idea, in
     which case, we are wasting our time.

  WEIR
     So what do you suggest?

  MCKAY
     Take another team back in the jumper, scan the
     planet for energy signatures. Chaya's people won't
     have a clue what we're doing from orbit, unless
     they're a technically advanced race that are
     pretending not to be...which has happened before.

  WEIR
     Did you find anything abnormal? I mean, something
     that would suggest they are more advanced than
     they claim to be?

  MCKAY
     No. They're either pathetically pre-technological
     or brilliantly post-technological.

  WEIR
     And there's no way this could be a natural
     phenomenon?

  MCKAY
     A perfectly timed, directional energy burst that
     only affected the Wraith ships?

  WEIR
     That's a no?

  MCKAY
     That's a no.

  BECKETT
     (over radio) Dr. Weir, I have those results.

  WEIR
     (into radio) Thank you, Carson. We're on our way.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Chaya walk the corridors.

  CHAYA
     How many of you are there?

  SHEPPARD
     Counting all the Athosians on the mainland, you
     might get a couple of hundred, which leaves a very
     large, empty city. Right now, we're living in one
     section, because we don't have the power to spread
     out more than that. What do you think so far?

  CHAYA
     I think it's wondrous...but ultimately, the
     decision is up to Athar.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard slumps in disappointment.

  CHAYA
     You're not a believer, are you?

  SHEPPARD
     Look, Chaya...I respect that you believe. Look, I
     can't talk to Athar; I can only talk to you, so
     let me ask you this: what if the shoe was on the
     other foot? What if your people were in trouble
     and we could help you? Would you just take no for
     an answer?

  CHAYA
     It must have been very hard to live your entire
     life under the shadow of the Wraith.

  SHEPPARD
     Don't misunderstand me. Teyla and her people have
     known the Wraith forever, but when I say we're
     new, I mean we just got here. We're from another
     galaxy. A planet called Earth.

  CHAYA
     Earth?

  SHEPPARD
     It's very far away. You know those clusters of
     stars you see in the night sky? Some of them are
     called galaxies, and they're even further away
     from you than the stars. Earth is in one of those
     galaxies.

  CHAYA
     You came through the Stargate.

  SHEPPARD
     That's right.

  CHAYA
     And can you not simply return?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, not simply. We knew going into it that it
     was probably going to be a one-way trip, but we
     thought what we would find here would be worth the
     risk.

  CHAYA
     And is it?

  SHEPPARD
     So far. Ask me again when the Wraith show up.

  ANNOTATION
     The have arrived back the gate room, and start to
     climb the stairs.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  BECKETT
     Blood work shows no viral, bacterial, or parasitic
     infections. MRI reveals no tumors or cancers; no
     heart defects of any kind. Blood pressure 130 over
     70; total cholesterol 107. She's in perfect
     health.

  WEIR
     I'm happy for her. Why did we need to see this?

  BECKETT
     Because, Doctor, she's too healthy.

  MCKAY
     What does that mean?

  BECKETT
     There's no trace of any diseases or congenital
     conditions that you typically find in
     pre-technological societies. No rickets no fungi,
     STDs...

  WEIR
     Perfect health?

  BECKETT
     Aye, and from what she told me, this may be the
     norm among her people.

  MCKAY
     But she is human?

  BECKETT
     Oh, without a doubt.

  WEIR
     So how is that possible?

  BECKETT
     I can't say that for certain without visiting the
     planet myself, but if this data is accurate, then
     people on Proculis live in optimal health for a
     very, very long time.

  MCKAY
     You make it sound like some sort of a--

  BECKETT
     Paradise? Aye, because it is.

  WEIR
     And that's a problem because?

  BECKETT
     Because human life, quite simply, Dr. Weir, is
     more fragile than that. I don't care what galaxy
     we're in. It's unnatural.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Chaya step outside.

  CHAYA
     The ocean air is so invigorating.

  SHEPPARD
     Plenty of that here. Most of the planet's ocean.

  CHAYA
     Well, surely there's enough land to resettle the
     refugees.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, there is. We just can't guarantee their
     safety.

  CHAYA
     Even though you control all of this?

  SHEPPARD
     I'd be lying if I said we controlled it all. This
     place is so far beyond us in so many ways. For
     example, Atlantis does have a shield that can
     withstand anything the Wraith could throw at us,
     but we have no way of powering it up. We can't
     risk taking in any more refugees than we already
     have. Come with me.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The walk toward the control room from the balcony.

  CHAYA
     Major Sheppard--

  SHEPPARD
     I'd prefer you call me John.

  CHAYA
     John...how did you make enemies of the Wraith?

  SHEPPARD
     That was my fault.

  CHAYA
     Yours?

  SHEPPARD
     I basically woke them up trying to rescue some
     people they'd captured. They didn't take too
     kindly to that.

  CHAYA
     But you saved your people?

  SHEPPARD
     Most of them.

  CHAYA
     And that is how you know for sure they're coming
     back?

  SHEPPARD
     (pointing to various consoles) Yeah, we just don't
     know when. Main control console, environmental
     support systems, communications, and this...this
     is, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     He mouths "what is this?" to Grodin.

  GRODIN
     Sorry, Major. We haven't the faintest idea what
     it--

  ANNOTATION
     Chaya touches the console, and it comes to life.

  GRODIN
     This is a new piece of equipment we found in
     another section of the city. It hadn't yet been
     initialized.

  SHEPPARD
     So you're saying she has...

  GRODIN
     She has the gene!

  CHAYA
     Did I do this? What does the machine do?

  GRODIN
     We don't know. Not yet, anyway.

  SHEPPARD
     The Atlantians were good at lots of things, but
     writing instruction manuals wasn't one of them. We
     should probably wrap this tour up. I know Dr. Weir
     is anxious to talk to you.

  CHAYA
     Will I see you afterwards?

  SHEPPARD
     And during.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, Teyla, Sheppard and Chaya are there.

  WEIR
     What we are proposing is a kind of land lease, in
     which refugees rendered homeless by the Wraith
     could resettle on Proculis. In return, we can
     offer you services and knowledge which would be of
     benefit to your people.

  CHAYA
     Such as?

  WEIR
     Well, you've seen the sort of technology we
     possess here. We could help you down a path to a
     more industrialized society, but at a pace that
     will maintain your planet's ecological balance.

  CHAYA
     Your scientific knowledge is impressive, Dr. Weir,
     but we have no need of it. Athar provides us with
     everything we require.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, food just doesn't show up on the dinner
     table.

  TEYLA
     You do plant all your own crops?

  CHAYA
     Of course we do.

  WEIR
     We can show you ways to increase your crop yields.

  CHAYA
     We grow all the food we need to live. Anything
     else would be gluttony.

  WEIR
     Building materials, then.

  CHAYA
     We have abundant timber and iron ore to forge what
     little metal we need. Athar is kind.

  WEIR
     There must be something.

  CHAYA
     What my people value most is spiritual knowledge.
     What can your culture provide in that regard?

  WEIR
     Earth's people don't share a single spiritual
     belief. We embrace a number of different religions
     and philosophies-- Christianity, Buddhism,
     Judaism, Islam...

  SHEPPARD
     Hinduism. Kwanzaa...

  CHAYA
     Interesting. Tell me about them.

  WEIR
     All of them?

  CHAYA
     Yes. They sound fascinating.

  WEIR
     Well, I am hardly competent to discuss all of
     Earth's religions, but I can offer you some
     resources. With very little training, you could
     have complete access to our historical database.

  CHAYA
     That would be wonderful.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay rushes in to see Grodin at the console Chaya
     had initialized.

  MCKAY
     You got it working?

  GRODIN
     Yeah.

  MCKAY
     Well, do we know what it does?

  GRODIN
     It would appear to be an internal-external
     biometric sensor array.

  MCKAY
     See, now, sadly, I understood that. Where did all
     those Saturday nights go?

  GRODIN
     These seem to be the biosignatures of everyone in
     Atlantis.

  MCKAY
     How can you tell? I can't make heads or tails out
     of that mess.

  GRODIN
     I've been working on deciphering the Ancient
     logarithms. I suspect this was designed primarily
     as an early warning system to signal any alien
     presence in the city, like the Wraith.

  MCKAY
     And you're saying that it activated when our
     visitor touched it?

  GRODIN
     Which must mean she has the Ancient gene.

  MCKAY
     Or it was initialized already and only activated
     because it was detecting her. I mean, she could be
     some kind of an alien, and this thing knows more
     about her than we've been able to decipher. Look,
     someone should be keeping an eye on her.

  GRODIN
     Major Sheppard is.

  MCKAY
     Oh, I'm sure he is.

  GRODIN
     Not entirely for the reasons you think. Dr. Weir
     asked him to.

  MCKAY
     I'm sure she did.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla walks beside Sheppard, who is carrying a
     picnic basket.

  SHEPPARD
     Dr. Weir wanted me to make sure Chaya saw
     everything.

  TEYLA
     Everything?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, not everything, everything. Chaya mentioned
     she wanted to see the best view of the city at
     night, which I think is atop the southwest pier,
     and since it's such a long walk, I thought I'd
     bring along a few provisions.

  TEYLA
     Continuing our efforts to secure a treaty.

  SHEPPARD
     Exactly.

  TEYLA
     As our ambassador.

  SHEPPARD
     (brightly) I am an ambassador, and she is
     a...diplomat.

  TEYLA
     (skeptical) On a late-night...picnic?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes.

  TEYLA
     I know that as ranking military officer here in
     Atlantis that you feel a heavy burden of
     responsibility but you...are allowed to have
     feelings for others.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh. No, this is a...this is an ambassadorial,
     diplomatic picnic outing...thing.

  TEYLA
     Without having to justify them to anyone. Good
     night, Major.

  SHEPPARD
     Good night, Teyla.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     You want to send her back?

  MCKAY
     All I know is she's not who she's pretending to
     be.

  WEIR
     And you know this because...?

  MCKAY
     What, I'm not allowed to have intuition?

  WEIR
     You? No.

  MCKAY
     Oh.

  WEIR
     I asked Major Sheppard to keep an eye on her.

  MCKAY
     Which is like asking the fox to guard the
     henhouse.

  WEIR
     What?

  MCKAY
     Well, look, the biometric differential is not
     insignificant, Elizabeth. What I'm saying is...the
     woman set off an alien alarm.

  WEIR
     Come on, you don't know that for certain. Now,
     Grodin says you are nowhere close to understanding
     what the nature of that device is.

  MCKAY
     There are too many unknown variables. There's the
     energy weapon, the fact that they claim never to
     have seen the Wraith... What about the fact that
     she's essentially a textbook case of healthy?

  WEIR
     All very mysterious, yes, but what does it prove?

  MCKAY
     That we should give her a one-way ticket back
     home.

  WEIR
     There is obviously something very...different
     about her, yes, but that doesn't necessarily make
     her a threat.

  MCKAY
     It doesn't rule it out, either.

  WEIR
     Then, for the moment, I think what we could gain
     by securing a treaty is worth the risk of her
     being here.

  MCKAY
     (frustrated) Fine.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Chaya sit on a blanket on the
     balcony, eating.

  CHAYA
     (drinking from a cup) Mmm. This is delicious.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause it's the last
     of what we have.

  CHAYA
     Then I am honored.

  SHEPPARD
     When McKay finds out, he's going to kill me.

  CHAYA
     Athar will save you.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, good.

  ANNOTATION
     They smile and chuckle.

  CHAYA
     Such wondrous things. I can't imagine wanting to
     do anything but eat all the time, with such a
     variety of foods.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we manage to pull ourselves away somehow.

  CHAYA
     I've been learning much about Earth. Dr. Weir has
     gotten me on your information machines.

  SHEPPARD
     Elizabeth's got you on a computer already, huh?

  CHAYA
     I'm fascinated by your many religions. So many
     beliefs. So many philosophies.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we've got a few of those.

  CHAYA
     So many contradictory faiths.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, it's a bit of a mess. More?

  CHAYA
     Yes, please.

  ANNOTATION
     He pours her more of the drink.

  SHEPPARD
     We traded for grapes. The Athosians, Teyla's
     people, they make this on the mainland.

  CHAYA
     I wasn't completely truthful with you about
     something. On Proculis, when I told you I did not
     feel lonely... Coming here, and being with
     you...it reminded me what it was like not to be
     alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard smiles and stands up.

  CHAYA
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I mean, nothing. It's just that...this is
     the first time I've been in a romantic situation
     with a woman from another planet, and it just
     strikes me as really, um...

  CHAYA
     Wrong?

  SHEPPARD
     No. God, no. Just...just...funny. I'm sorry. I
     just thought that I would, uh...

  CHAYA
     You said it yourself--we're both human.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes. We are. And I'm really glad you didn't say
     "family," otherwise I'd have to leave.

  CHAYA
     Don't.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits down beside her.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not going anywhere.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin kissing.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard walks alone, then McKay catches up to
     him.

  MCKAY
     Major.

  SHEPPARD
     (surprised) Rodney. What are you doing up so late?

  MCKAY
     I was just, uh...I couldn't sleep, so I was going
     back up to the control room to do a little
     research. What about you?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, no thanks.

  MCKAY
     No, I mean, what were you doing up so late?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm always up late, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     A word of caution--the whole Captain Kirk routine
     is problematic, to say the least, let alone
     morally dubious.

  SHEPPARD
     What routine?

  MCKAY
     The romancing the alien priestess. It's very 1967
     of you. Actually, I'm surprised--

  SHEPPARD
     If and when anything I do becomes your business...

  MCKAY
     It becomes my business, Major, when an alien woman
     who is clearly not who she claims to be has the
     ranking military officer wrapped around her little
     finger.

  SHEPPARD
     Don't go there, McKay.

  MCKAY
     I'm sorry. I know I'm not normally Mr. Sensitive,
     but you've got to believe me when I say there is
     something about her. I know it's intangible, but I
     can feel it--

  SHEPPARD
     (stepping toward McKay, angry) I said don't go
     there!

  MCKAY
     It's just a matter of time before I prove it,
     Major. I'm just recommending that in the meantime,
     you keep your...

  ANNOTATION
     Chaya has entered from a door behind McKay. She
     crosses her arms as if annoyed by what she has
     heard. She turns and leaves. McKay gives Sheppard
     a defiant look; Sheppard looks at him sternly then
     leaves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAWN


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay shows Weir to a laptop with graphics on it.

  WEIR
     Did you sleep last night?

  MCKAY
     No. This is the data from the biometric sensors. I
     can't tell you exactly what all of these
     signatures mean, but, uh, look at this. These are
     ours, and this, this is hers. There's a distinct
     difference.

  WEIR
     She was born on another planet in another galaxy.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) They're different from Teyla's, too.

  WEIR
     That doesn't mean--

  MCKAY
     Elizabeth, she's not what she seems to be.

  WEIR
     I sense nothing but a very honest and spiritual
     person.

  MCKAY
     All right. There may be a way to find out. You're
     opening negotiations with her this morning, right?
     Okay, well, let me sit in. I'll pretend to be
     taking notes on the laptop when really I'll be
     scanning her for anomalies. Radiation, E.M. scans,
     energy signatures... That way if I am crazy, you
     and I are the only ones who need to know. Now,
     what's the harm?

  WEIR
     All right...but be discreet.

  MCKAY
     I'm Mr. Discreet.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay has sensors attached the underside of the
     table, aimed at Chaya. He works at a laptop on top
     of the table.

  CHAYA
     I admit to being impressed by most of what I've
     read of Earth religions. The Torah, the Koran, the
     Talmud, the Bible... Most of them reveal a diverse
     and deep desire to grasp the divine.

  WEIR
     So we do have something we can offer you.

  CHAYA
     But I've also been reading about your history.
     Even now, somewhere on your planet, you are at
     war.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, yeah, that's true.

  WEIR
     I made no attempt to hide that fact from you.
     Chaya, we are definitely not perfect.

  CHAYA
     There's a lot about you as a people that I find
     disturbing.

  TEYLA
     Can that not be said of any people?

  CHAYA
     No. Every soul in Proculis is free from the hatred
     and the anger the people from Earth seem to feel
     for each other.

  SHEPPARD
     Come on. We're not all that bad. You know that.

  ANNOTATION
     The touches his arm with a smile.

  CHAYA
     I do.

  WEIR
     We're not talking about the people on Earth. I'm
     talking about every member of my expedition team
     here in Atlantis, and I'm talking about the
     friends we've met since coming here, like Teyla's
     people.

  CHAYA
     There are some among you--yourself included, Dr.
     Weir--that I know Athar would welcome with open
     arms... But there are others.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks at McKay, who continues to work on his
     laptop.

  WEIR
     I hand-picked every member of this expedition, and
     I know Teyla feels as confident about her own
     people.

  CHAYA
     I'm sure.

  WEIR
     At the end of the day, this is a matter of trust.

  CHAYA
     Yes. It is, Dr. Weir. Have your scans found
     anything yet, Dr. McKay?

  MCKAY
     Uh... Uh, actually...no.

  ANNOTATION
     He closes his laptop.

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell is this?

  WEIR
     I'm sorry, Major. There was cause for legitimate
     concern as to--

  CHAYA
     Whether I was or not who I claimed to be.

  WEIR
     I'm sorry, Chaya. I honestly felt it would do no
     harm.

  MCKAY
     (standing) Stop apologizing, Elizabeth. How did
     she know?

  SHEPPARD
     McKay!

  MCKAY
     She's an Ancient, Major.

  SHEPPARD
     She's what?

  MCKAY
     I'm right, aren't I? The perfect health, the
     energy weapon the fact that she has the gene...
     It's the only logical explanation.

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you talking about?

  MCKAY
     I just don't understand the act. I mean, you must
     know we'd give just about anything to talk to you,
     to learn from you. I mean, what is it? What, are
     you... checking us out?

  CHAYA
     I see that in my desire to come to Atlantis, I
     have revealed too much of myself.

  WEIR
     He's right?

  MCKAY
     I'm right?

  CHAYA
     I am what you call an "Ancient"... And it is also
     true that I can never offer your people
     sanctuary... But you are wrong as to why I came
     here.

  SHEPPARD
     Why did you come here?

  CHAYA
     You, John.

  SHEPPARD
     Me?

  CHAYA
     I have lived in solitude for so long that when you
     asked me to come to Atlantis, I...

  MCKAY
     (sitting) Oh, my God, he is Kirk.

  SHEPPARD
     So this was never about uh... Could we just have a
     moment to ourselves here?

  MCKAY, TEYLA, AND WEIR
     (in unison) No.

  CHAYA
     (standing) That's all right. I've stayed here long
     enough.

     She resumes her ascended form.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard moves away from the Wraith ships. The
     energy "weapon" appears again and starts
     destroying the Wraith. Sheppard sees what's going
     on and turns the Jumper toward the planet.


LOCATION--CHAYA'S TEMPLE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rushes up the stairs and back down. Chaya
     appears across the courtyard.

  SHEPPARD
     Is it "Chaya" or "Athar"? I'm just curious.

  CHAYA
     When I was a mortal, I lived here. This was my
     home. When those of us who you call the Ancients
     ascended, we were supposed to leave behind us all
     human ties. Some of us found that difficult.

  SHEPPARD
     So you couldn't stand by and watch your people
     getting wiped out by the Wraith.

  CHAYA
     When their terrible fleet approached, I lashed out
     with my mind, and with a single thought, destroyed
     them all. The others of my kind did not approve of
     such interference with corporeal matters and so I
     was exiled. My punishment was the unending
     protection of this world.

  SHEPPARD
     (walking toward her) Why pretend to be human at
     all?

  CHAYA
     So that, time to time, I may walk among the
     people, know them as the good and kind souls they
     are. For thousands of years, I have come and gone
     to the villages, never staying too long to get
     attached to anyone...until I met you. I have never
     regretted the choice I made all of these
     years...until now. I am permitted to safeguard my
     people, but my people only. This is my punishment.
     This is what makes it punishment. If your people
     came here for my protection, the others would stop
     me. Do you understand? I can never help your
     people.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not sure I'm willing to walk away that easily.
     And I'm not just talking personally here, although
     that's definitely part of it... There is so much
     more we can learn from you.

  CHAYA
     I can't, John. The others won't allow it.

  SHEPPARD
     That's just--

  CHAYA
     It is their highest law to never interfere. I am
     bound by those laws, however much I wish to help
     you.

  SHEPPARD
     So, uh, we can never...

  CHAYA
     I can never leave.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I could come and visit. And now I'm flirting
     with somebody from another species.

  CHAYA
     We're not as different as you think.

  SHEPPARD
     I think we're more different than you think.

  CHAYA
     I can show you.

  SHEPPARD
     Show me?

  CHAYA
     By sharing each other. We will know each other as
     well as anyone ever can.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay. I've got to get the car back by midnight,
     though.

  CHAYA
     This will only take a few moments. Just close your
     eyes.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes his arms in hers, then partially
     transforms into energy, wrapping her energy around
     him.

  SHEPPARD
     This is cool...
