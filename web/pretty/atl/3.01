No Man's Land Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus is under attack by two hive ships, its
     shields taking most of the energy.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell is in command. Sheppard stands beside
     between him and Marks, hanging onto their chairs
     as the ship rocks from the blasts.

  SHEPPARD
     With some 302s, we might be able to take out the
     hyperdrive, save us some time.

  CALDWELL
     Do it.

  KLEINMAN
     Shields are at sixty percent!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Four F-302s launch from the hangar bay of
     Daedalus. The pilots speak to each other over
     their radios.

  MEYERS
     I've got incoming.

  SHEPPARD
     Dagger 3 and 4, let's try to keep these darts off
     our six.

  MEYERS
     Roger that.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard moves forward and fires on one of the
     Hive ships. After a moment, many darts come out to
     face them, then split up to follow each pair of
     302s. As each speak, they are shown in their
     cockpits.

  ANDERS
     Half the bogies are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4.
     We've got the other half hot on our tail.

  MEYERS
     I'm taking fire. I've lost the generator.

  SHEPPARD
     Stand by to break left on my mark. Mark! Fox Four.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's ship fires two missiles at one of the
     Hives. They explode amidst the swarm of Darts,
     destroying many.

  SHEPPARD
     We're in the clear. Continue to target.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  KLEINMAN
     Shields are under twenty percent.

  CALDWELL
     Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the
     ship. We need to jump out of here as soon as
     possible.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's F-302 moves in very fast, very close to
     the Hive.

  SHEPPARD
     Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     Unless you can shut down their weapons, it's not
     going to do us much good.


LOCATION--F-302 COCKPIT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sees two boggies move around behind his
     ship.

  SHEPPARD
     Damn it. Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my
     attack run to the target hyperdrive.

  MEYERS
     Roger that, leader. I'm on my way.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     She takes out the two boggies. She and Sheppard
     speak over the radios.

  MEYERS
     The remaining darts are returning to the hives.

  SHEPPARD
     Can you go to max thrust?

  MEYERS
     Negative.

  SHEPPARD
     Head back to the Daedalus.

  MEYERS
     Roger that.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  KLEINMAN
     The hives are opening hyperspace windows.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Both Hives enter hyperspace.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell gets up and approaches the forward
     viewscreen.

  CALDWELL
     Why the hell'd they do that?

  KLEINMAN
     Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.

  CALDWELL
     Sheppard?

  KLEINMAN
     His fighter isn't one of them. The only contacts I
     have on screen are wreckage.

  CALDWELL
     What about his locator beacon?

  KLEINMAN
     Nothing, sir. He's just gone.

  CALDWELL
     Understood.


LOCATION--F-302 COCKPIT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard removes his air mask and looks upward
     through his window.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay. This is new.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's F-302 is attached to the top of one of
     the Hives as it speeds through hyperspace.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell climbs the stairs to the control room,
     where he meets Weir.

  WEIR
     Colonel Caldwell. What's the status of the
     repairs?

  CALDWELL
     Ongoing. We lost a few key personnel in the
     attack.

  WEIR
     Yes, we did.

  CALDWELL
     I'm sorry.

  WEIR
     So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them.
     I've just briefed General Landry. We're to check
     in in an hour and advise him of our response to
     this.

  ANNOTATION
     The walk to Weir's office, Zelenka and Teyla
     following.

  CALDWELL
     I've got a broken ship and serious casualties. I
     don't know what sort of response you have in mind,
     but--

  WEIR
     I want you to redeploy immediately.

  CALDWELL
     Excuse me?

  WEIR
     As long as they're still in striking distance, we
     have to at least try.

  CALDWELL
     You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.

  WEIR
     Radek?

  ZELENKA
     Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives
     using the information they were able to steal from
     our database. The Aurora mission reports--

  CALDWELL
     Obviously.

  ZELENKA
     However, their ships are organic in nature. They
     will need to make brief pauses to recover from the
     effects of hyperspace radiation.

  WEIR
     Where and when?

  ZELENKA
     Uh, yeah, uh, it will take some time to calculate.

  WEIR
     Go.

  ZELENKA
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka leaves.

  CALDWELL
     Look, Dr. Weir, I want to go after these bastards
     as much as you do, but the Daedalus is in no
     position to fight right now. Our shields are
     severely depleted. Several decks are inaccessible.
     Even if we could catch up with them, I don't know
     how long we'd last.

  WEIR
     Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.

  TEYLA
     It was recalled the moment the Wraith computer
     virus was revealed.

  CALDWELL
     And it's in no better shape than Daedalus.

  WEIR
     It will fly, and by the time you reach the hive
     ships, it should also be able to fight.

  CALDWELL
     And if it isn't?

  WEIR
     Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable
     of engaging the hive ships before they reach
     Earth. They cannot be allowed to get that far,
     Steven.

  CALDWELL
     You know what you're asking me to do?

  WEIR
     I do.

  CALDWELL
     There's still repairs that need to be made.

  WEIR
     Do what you have to do.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves. Weir and Teyla exchange concerned
     looks.


LOCATION--HYPERSPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The two Hives move through hyperspace.


LOCATION--HIVE SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and McKay are trapped beside each other
     inside Wraith pods, stored there as future food.
     McKay's face is partially protruding from the
     webbing. Ronon is pushing hard on the webbing of
     his pod.

  MCKAY
     They couldn't have. Even if they somehow deduced
     the location of Earth, they still wouldn't be able
     to get there, not unless they... They downloaded
     something along with the hive ship plans,
     something like spyware. It's like when I stupidly
     downloaded por--Music. When I downloaded music. I
     asked them to do it. I did this. I'm responsible
     for the destruction of my own planet.

  RONON
     If anybody was going to do it, it'd be you.

  MCKAY
     Thank you. Thank you so much for that!

  RONON
     Stop worrying about it now. Just focus.

  MCKAY
     Focus on what? What is there to focus on? I'm
     stuck in a cocoon.

  RONON
     Getting out of here.

  MCKAY
     Oh, right. Of course. Now, why didn't I think of
     that? Of course. Here goes. Um, nope. Still can't
     move. I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof,
     there, big guy.


LOCATION--HYPERSPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The two Hives move through hyperspace. Sheppard's
     F302 sits on a surface on the underside of one.
     His ship is tiny compared to the Hive, merely a
     speck on the hull.


LOCATION--F303 COCKPIT

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, can't sit here forever.

  ANNOTATION
     He brings up a control panel that asks if he wants
     to disengage docking clamps. He hesitates.

  SHEPPARD
     Hit them while they're in hyperspace. They'll
     never know what happened. Is that even possible?

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--ATLANTIS CAFETERIA

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Zelenka argue as Sheppard eats and looks
     between them at an attractive female crew-member.

  MCKAY
     There is no reason to believe that their
     hyperspace field is any different from ours, and
     we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus while in
     hyperspace.

  ZELENKA
     No, I'm simply talking about maneuvering within
     the field, not passing through it. What do you
     think?

  ANNOTATION
     The woman smiles back at Sheppard.

  ZELENKA
     Colonel?

  SHEPPARD
     Hmm? What? Yes.

  MCKAY
     He's not listening.


LOCATION--F303 COCKPIT

  SHEPPARD
     I've got to pay more attention to those guys.

  ANNOTATION
     He pushes the "no" selection on releasing the
     docking clamps.


LOCATION--HIVE SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Michael approaches the Queen of the Hive.

  QUEEN
     Yes, Michael?

  MICHAEL
     You should have told me that we were going to
     betray the Atlanteans.

  QUEEN
     Are you feeling sympathy for them?

  MICHAEL
     No. But I don't understand why I wasn't told. I
     told you of their plan because I believed it was a
     viable way of--

  QUEEN
     You are only alive because you still may prove to
     be useful. But I fear, Michael that the lingering
     stench of what they've transformed you into will
     never fade.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael hisses at her, then turns and walks away.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The gate is active. Weir speaks to Landry over a
     video link.

  WEIR
     In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop
     out of hyperspace (showing a map) here. It's just
     outside of the Pegasus Galaxy.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir speaks into a laptop.

  WEIR
     There they will pause for 15 hours. If Daedalus
     and Orion break orbit on our current schedule,
     they should be able to reach those coordinates in
     just under fourteen hours, best possible speed.

  LANDRY
     Narrow window.

  WEIR
     It's the only window, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between the
     two control rooms.

  LANDRY
     Understood. Now, the International Oversight
     Advisory want you to brief them on this matter.

  WEIR
     When would you like me to dial in again?

  LANDRY
     You misunderstand me. I mean in person, and I mean
     right now. The president himself assigned--

  WEIR
     I can't just leave, not now.

  LANDRY
     I'm afraid that's not up to you.

  WEIR
     There is far too much going on here.

  LANDRY
     Doctor... You've done all you're going to do for
     now. I need you to step through that gate. They're
     waiting for you in my briefing room... Dr. Weir?

  WEIR
     I see.

  ANNOTATION
     She signs off and stands up.

  WEIR
     (upset) Teyla...we are awaiting several teams to
     return from their missions. Once that happens, I'd
     like to suspend all gate travel till this whole
     thing is over.

  TEYLA
     Of course.

  WEIR
     And I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is
     ready to leave.

  TEYLA
     I know what to do, Elizabeth.

  WEIR
     Of course you do.

  TEYLA
     I will see you when you return.

  WEIR
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla sits in Weir's chair. Weir walks down to the
     gate room and through the active wormhole,
     carrying only a laptop.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE

  ANNOTATION
     The travel is much longer than an intra-galaxy
     trip.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir walks through. Landry awaits her at the
     bottom of the ramp. The walk and talk, making
     their way down the corridor and up to the control
     room.

  LANDRY
     Welcome back to Earth.

  WEIR
     Thank you, general.

  WEIR
     It's wonderful to be here.

  LANDRY
     I can see that.

  WEIR
     You know, I considered disobeying your order.
     There wouldn't have been too much you could do
     about it.

  LANDRY
     You made the right decision in coming.

  WEIR
     We're in the middle of a crisis, General. This is
     absolutely--

  LANDRY
     Don't bite my head off, Elizabeth. The recall
     order didn't come from me.

  WEIR
     Who it came from doesn't matter.

  LANDRY
     What if I told you it came from the President?

  WEIR
     I wouldn't believe you.

  LANDRY
     And you'd be right. But in a couple of weeks,
     there could be aliens on our doorstep determined
     to feed on the human race. The President had no
     choice but to accede to the I.O.A.'s demand that
     you be brought back to explain yourself.

  WEIR
     (looking up toward briefing room) So, what do they
     really want?

  LANDRY
     To point fingers, cover their asses...

  WEIR
     I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that,
     sir.

  LANDRY
     They're bureaucrats, Elizabeth. You'll have them
     for breakfast.


LOCATION--HYPERSPACE


LOCATION--WRAITH HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Michael walks down a corridor. Two Wraith drones
     step in front of him and block his path.

  MICHAEL
     There is work I must attend to... Stand aside...
     Am I to sit quietly in my quarters?

  ANNOTATION
     They ignore him. He hisses at them strongly, then
     walks back the way he came.


LOCATION--WRAITH HIVE SHIP POD SECTION

  MCKAY
     You know, these things are actually quite
     comfortable. Surprisingly warm, take all the
     pressure off the spine... I suppose they're as
     good a place as any to witness the end of humanity
     as we know it.

  RONON
     You're wasting your energy talking.

  MCKAY
     Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and
     grants you one wish, and we break out? Then what,
     huh? We're still on a hive, we're still traveling
     through hyperspace, probably in the massive void
     between our two galaxies...where there aren't even
     planets, let alone Stargates. What then, huh? Do
     we fly home on the wings of imagination? Is that
     what we do, Ronon?

  RONON
     You can sit here and die if you like, but I'm not
     giving up.

  MCKAY
     Oh, fine. I will.

  RONON
     Fine!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Hives exit hyperspace and come to a stop in
     space.


LOCATION--F302 COCKPIT

  SHEPPARD
     Okay. Time to do some damage. Ronon, Rodney, can
     you hear me?


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB ABOARD HIVE SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Michael has Ronon and Rodney's gear, including
     their radios, which come to life with Sheppard's
     voice.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney? I know this is a long shot, but if you can
     hear me, please respond. If you're near a radio, I
     need you to come in. I need to know your location.
     Guys?

  MICHAEL
     Colonel Sheppard? Is that you?

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between
     Sheppard's F302 and Michael's lab.

  SHEPPARD
     Who's this?

  MICHAEL
     You know me as Michael.

  SHEPPARD
     Sorry...I got the wrong number.

  MICHAEL
     Ronon and Dr. McKay are still alive.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you going to do with them?

  MICHAEL
     If you want them to live, listen to me... If your
     friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these
     ships in order for them to reach us.

  SHEPPARD
     If you really want to help, why don't you just do
     that?

  MICHAEL
     They would know.

  SHEPPARD
     Aren't you "they"?

  MICHAEL
     Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as
     you were.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, I don't know. I was pretty deceived.

  MICHAEL
     It seems, Colonel, that because of what you did to
     me...the Wraith no longer see me as one of their
     own.

  SHEPPARD
     (falsely sympathetic) Oh, that's why you want to
     help, because you don't feel welcome.

  MICHAEL
     We don't have time to discuss this.

  SHEPPARD
     Sure we do. I've got a...good three hours of air
     left.

  MICHAEL
     Where are you?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, wouldn't you like to know.

  MICHAEL
     I need to know what level you are on so I can
     guide you from there.

  SHEPPARD
     You mean, trust you.

  MICHAEL
     Are you in a position not to?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh...I've got you right where I want you.

  MICHAEL
     I doubt I will be allowed to live much
     longer...and yet I very much want to continue
     living. If you want to survive as I do, then I
     suggest you tell me where you are.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your
     ship. You still want to help?

  MICHAEL
     Targeting the ventral hyperdrive generators would
     be most effective.

  SHEPPARD
     (confused) Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

  MICHAEL
     Then I suggest you act now before you are
     discovered.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     An array of familiar IOA officials sit opposite
     Weir.

  WEIR
     The leader of the hive presented a scenario which
     made it seem we were under a time constraint. To
     speed up the problem solving, we distributed the
     file--

  SHEN
     And played right into their hands.

  WEIR
     Yes.

  WOOLSEY
     In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every
     action they took along the way.

  SHEN
     And we supported her recommendations, I know...
     but clearly, we were not in possession of all of
     the facts.

  WEIR
     Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.

  WOOLSEY
     So, what measures have you taken to prevent the
     Wraith from reaching Earth?

  WEIR
     I was coordinating a strike against the hive ships
     when you recalled me.

  BRITISH IOA REP
     With what?

  WEIR
     With everything we've got.

  SHEN
     Is that wise?

  WEIR
     General Landry has informed me that in light of
     fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori, the
     weapons platform in Antarctica, powered by a pair
     of Mark II generators, would be Earth's only
     defense. Now, I believe it would be far better to
     stop them while they're still within reach of
     Atlantis.

  WOOLSEY
     Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM
     back to Earth on the Daedalus ensuring successful
     operation of the Antarctic weapons platform when
     the Wraith arrive?

  WEIR
     The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the
     first battle. A long journey at full power was out
     of the question. And there is no way of knowing
     how much faster the Wraith ships have become.

  SHEN
     You would risk the lives of everyone aboard those
     ships in order to undo your mistake?

  WEIR
     Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing
     emergency repairs. There is still time to beam the
     ZPM aboard. But either plan will require Daedalus
     to break orbit within the next hour.

  BRITISH IOA REP
     Then if you'll excuse us...we need some time to
     discuss our options.

  WEIR
     I have instructed Atlantis to...to contact the SGC
     when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
     If you would like to overturn my standing orders
     at that time, go right ahead. But you will have to
     fire me first.

  ANNOTATION
     Angry, she stands and leaves.

LOCATION--WRAITH HIVE SHIP POD SECTION

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon seems to be trying to cut through the
     webbing.

  MCKAY
     I wonder what they'll do to us. Feed on us,
     probably. I mean, that's... That's what they do.

  RONON
     It's not going to come to that.

  MCKAY
     Maybe. Earth'll probably mount some kind of
     defense, in which case, I imagine death would be
     instantaneous. Unless we're trapped on a deck with
     a fire or something. Then we'd be burned alive.
     Well, burned alive or suffocate. I wonder which
     would be worse, being life-sucked by the Wraith or
     burned alive. I honestly couldn't consider two
     worse options.

  RONON
     Stop talking.

  MCKAY
     Okay, you know what? Make me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon begins cutting at the webbing with a knife.

  MCKAY
     What are you doing? Where did you get that?

  RONON
     I was trying to get my hands free so I could get
     to it.

  MCKAY
     Would it have killed you to tell me?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon breaks free of the pod and steps out of it.

  RONON
     Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than
     a minute.

  MCKAY
     What? Don't just stand there. Cut me loose.

  RONON
     Only if you put an end to all this "we're going to
     die, there's no hope" talk.

  MCKAY
     Well, now there is hope!

  RONON
     Ready.

  MCKAY
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon cuts Rodney out of his pod.

  MCKAY
     God, a little help, please? Oh, it's freezing out
     here!

  RONON
     Would you prefer to go back in?

  MCKAY
     No.

  RONON
     So now what?

  MCKAY
     What?

  RONON
     How do we get out of here?

  MCKAY
     Well, I don't...

  RONON
     What?

  MCKAY
     You said no more death talk.

  RONON
     McKay...

  MCKAY
     Look, fine, we're out of the cocoons. So what?
     We're still stuck on the ship, and there's no way
     off it without... Well, in any survivable way.

  RONON
     You'll think of something.

  MCKAY
     It's not a question of thinking.

  RONON
     You'll think of something.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay pulls at the tendrils still attached to him.

  MCKAY
     Fine. Can we at least go somewhere else? Can you
     get this off me? It's down my back. It's down my
     back.

  RONON
     Just...

  ANNOTATION
     Weir looks to Woolsey.

  WOOLSEY
     They haven't reached a decision.

  WEIR
     And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey, because if
     they agree or disagree with me, then they have to
     take some sort of responsibility. No, they'd
     rather have someone to blame. I give this order,
     either way, they have a scapegoat if something
     goes wrong. It's all part of the game.

     Uh, yes. They'd like to continue debriefing you
     now.

  WEIR
     Yeah, I bet they would.

  WOOLSEY
     Excuse me?

  WEIR
     No. I'm not going to sit there and have them rake
     me over the coals about every decision I've made
     these past two years that they don't agree with in
     hindsight.

  WOOLSEY
     Dr. Weir, you know I have the greatest respect for
     you, but as far as the I.O.A. is concerned, you're
     not exactly the employee of the month right now.

  WEIR
     If the Wraith make it to Earth, then keeping my
     job will be the least of my concerns.

  WOOLSEY
     And if your plan succeeds?

  WEIR
     Then I expect to keep my job, yes, because I did
     what they, apparently, are incapable of doing. I
     made a decision. The fact is, at this point there
     really is nothing more we can do but wait and see

  RONON
     I never said it was an escape plan.

  MCKAY
     (incensed) How is it a plan?

  RONON
     You're the one who says there's no way out of
     this. If we're already dead, I say we take them
     with us.

  MCKAY

     create, at the very least, a-a CO2 filtration
     system.

  MCKAY
     By the time we got something like that up and

     But, it's worth a try.

  MCKAY
     Yes, yeah, but regardless, we need more
     electricians and welders than are technically

     MCKAY Okay, fine they're reserved for people
     working on getting life-support systems
     operational. We need those people as clear-headed

     Radek. Atlantis has no ship to send, and even if
     we were somehow able to repair the array and get a
     message back to Earth, it would still take them
     weeks to get a rescue here.

  ZELENKA
     I wasn't thinking of rescue. I was thinking simply
     of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith, and
     perhaps letting someone know the sacrifice that
     we've done.

  MCKAY
     Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to
     dedicate my last breath of air to getting more
     air. (inspired) Wait a second.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay speaks to Caldwell, Michael and Sheppard.

  MCKAY
     The only breathable air within light years is on
     the Wraith ship.

  CALDWELL
     There're also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship,
     doctor.

  SHEPPARD
     So we take them. Beam an assault team in.

  MICHAEL
     You would be far out-numbered.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we're dead here. I'll take my chances.

  MICHAEL
     I admire your courage, Colonel, but you would be
     dead there as surely as here... Unless we send
     over the gas.

  MCKAY
     Yes, yes, yes. That could work.

  MICHAEL
     The retrovirus gas would make them virtually
     harmless.

  SHEPPARD
     Do we still have it on board?

  CALDWELL
     Yes, we do. And now that Michael's disabled their
     jamming codes...

  MCKAY
     We finish the plan we started.

  SHEPPARD
     We beam over the gas and wait. We wait long
     enough, they won't even want to put up a fight.

  MCKAY
     Because they'll be humans with no memories. I
     can't believe I might actually survive this.

  CALDWELL
     We're almost out of breathable air now, and the
     retrovirus takes a minimum ten hours to run its
     course.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the
     302s. (to Michael) If this works, can you fly the
     hive ship?

  MICHAEL
     I could.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you say, Colonel?

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Weaps, get us within beaming range of
     the hive.

  WEAPONS
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC VISITORS' OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Landry knocks on the doorway of Weir's SGC office.
     The door is open.

  WEIR
     (concerned) Anything?

  LANDRY
     No. No contacts yet. Our tests of the Mark Two
     generator and the chair in Antarctica are
     promising.

  WEIR
     "Promising." That doesn't sound very promising.

  LANDRY
     Yeah, we're fairly confident the Ancient weapon
     will take care of the hive ships, but doing so
     will probably require the last of our drones, and
     there goes our secret weapon. We'd really rather
     not have to do that. How'd it go with the I.O.A.?

  WEIR
     Oh, you know. I mean does anyone ever come out of
     an I.O.A. deposition saying, "That went well"?

  LANDRY
     No, I don't suppose they do.

  WEIR
     It was what it was.

  LANDRY
     Well, at least most of the time you're a galaxy
     away. That Woolsey guy is here almost every other
     week.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry sits across from Weird.

  WEIR
     I think they're going to ask me to step down.

  LANDRY
     Well, if they're just going to ask, you can always
     say no.

  WEIR
     I messed this one up, General.

  LANDRY
     Yeah, you did.

  WEIR
     And I lost some of the best people I've ever--

  LANDRY
     But you proceeded with the blessing of the I.O.A
     and Stargate Command, as I recall.

  WEIR
     Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.

  LANDRY
     "Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It's
     the courage to continue that counts." And I think
     you've got that in spades.

  WEIR
     Churchill?

  LANDRY
     Yeah except for that last part about you. That was
     all me. Get some sleep, Elizabeth.

  WEIR
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry leaves, and Weir contemplates his words.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus moves slowly around the Wraith ship, the
     Milky Way visible behind it.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Crewmen sit on the floor as those with survival
     breathing packs work on the ship. McKay is one of
     those working. Sweating, he walks slowly on the
     bridge.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  KLEINMAN
     (weakly) Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous,
     sir.

  CALDWELL
     (weakly) The gas has barely had a chance to run
     its course.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and a team of marines sit behind
     Caldwell. They stand.

  SHEPPARD
     We don't have much of a choice. We've got to go
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the bridge, Ronon assisting McKay.


LOCATION--WRAITH HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The team beams aboard. The move out and find many
     Wraith now turned human, lying on the floor. One
     gasps. Sheppard looks on over.

  SHEPPARD
     Some of them are dead.

  LORNE
     Looks like they killed each other.

  WRAITH TURNED HUMAN
     What's happened?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and the others turn their weapons on the
     man for a moment.

  SHEPPARD
     It's all right. (to a marine) Find a holding area.
     Start marshaling the survivors there.

  MCKAY
     The queen's chamber should be that way.


LOCATION--QUEEN'S CHAMBER ON HIVE SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive cautiously. The Queen struggles on her
     throne, her face hidden.

  SHEPPARD
     Hello? You all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne goes to her aid.

  LORNE
     It's okay. You're going to be all right now.

  ANNOTATION
     The Queen, still a Wraith, grabs Lorne at the
     throat and lifts him off the deck. She yells and
     prepares to feed on him. McKay and the others
     shoot her, and she drops Lorne on the stairs.

  LORNE
     It didn't work on her.

  MCKAY
     Oh. Beckett wondered if the females would be
     immune.

  LORNE
     Yeah. Something you might have mentioned before
     she almost killed me, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     I only thought of it now.

  MARINE
     (over radio) Colonel Sheppard, so far we haven't
     run into a single Wraith, sir.

  SHEPPARD
     Understood. (into radio) Sheppard to Daedalus.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) Go ahead.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) You can start sending people over,
     sir. They're all human, and the air is good. I
     think we're out of the woods.
