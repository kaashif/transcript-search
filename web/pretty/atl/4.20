The Last Man Part 1
TEASER

LOCATION--STARGATE AREA, M4S-587, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard meets up with Lorne's team at the area.

  LORNE
     So how'd it go, sir?

  SHEPPARD
     (frustrated) The Genii contact didn't show up.

  LORNE
     Can't say I'm surprised.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you saying, Major? The Genii can't be
     trusted?

  LORNE
     Well they did try to kill you and Doctor McKay,
     along with that little girl.

  SHEPPARD
     True, true. And normally, that's the kind of thing
     I take personally. But, Ladon claims he didn't
     order the hit. He's trying to get on our good
     side.

  LORNE
     Do you really think they know anything about where
     Michael took Teyla?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, they got solid intel, and we're following up
     any lead, no matter how thin.

  LORNE
     Okay, so, what do you want to do?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard starts to dial the DHD.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I'm going go ahead. You stay behind for a
     few hours. Tell me if he shows up.

  LORNE
     Will do.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard pauses before walking to the wormhole.

  SHEPPARD
     We're going to find her, Major.

  LORNE
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard steps through the Stargate.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT



LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard arrives. The wormhole shuts down behind
     him. There is a red glow from the light coming
     through the windows. The control room is quiet and
     deserted.

  SHEPPARD
     Somebody turn up the heat? (calling out) Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     There is no one else anywhere around.

  SHEPPARD
     (nervously) If this is a surprise party, it's not
     my birthday.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard walks up to the control room.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) This is Sheppard, anyone read?...I
     repeat, this is Sheppard. Anyone on this channel?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard goes to the balcony doors. He has to
     manually pry them open.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard steps out onto the balcony. The ocean has
     dried up, making the entire area a barren desert.
     The city itself is half buried under sands,
     showing this was not a recent development. The
     sunlight that beats down on Sheppard has a reddish
     glow. Sheppard looks around intently, breathing
     hard.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard reenters the control room and tries to
     activate some of the stations. Nothing starts.

  SHEPPARD
     (muttering to himself) All right. This is either
     the most elaborate practical joke of all time, or
     I'm in serious trouble here.

  ANNOTATION
     The radio crackles. A garbled voice can be heard
     through the static.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) This is Sheppard. Anyone on this
     frequency?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Sheppard, is that really you?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio, relieved) McKay!

  MCKAY
     (over radio) I can't believe it. It actually
     worked!

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) What are you talking about? What the
     hell's going on here?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Well, I-I imagine you're a little
     confused right now. God, for you, like what, five
     minutes has passed?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Rodney!

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Look, I need you to describe exactly
     what you're seeing. Where are you?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) I'm in the control room. It's
     deserted.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Is there any power?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio, slightly panicky) No, everything's
     dead. And, oh yeah, did I tell you the ocean's
     gone?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Sorry, what?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) The big blue thing out the window,
     it-it's gone! It-it's a desert. And it's about a
     hundred and twenty degrees in here.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Whoa. Jeez. The planet must have
     undergone some serious climate changes!

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio, threatening) If you don't start
     giving me some answers pretty soon here...

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Okay, look, I understand this is hard
     for you. Just...do me a favor and go to the
     hologram room.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Why?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Just do it. Please.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard runs down the steps.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard runs through the empty corridors to the
     hologram room.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS HOLOGRAM ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The room is dark and empty when Sheppard arrives.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) All right, I'm here.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Well, activate the hologram
     projector.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) There's no power.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Heh, it's connected to an independent
     power source. Don't worry, it will work.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard passes his hand over the controls. The
     room lights up and McKay appears behind him. McKay
     has aged--his hair is grey, his face wrinkled. He
     wears a cardigan and other loose casual clothes.

  MCKAY
     Hey there.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard spins around and looks at McKay in shock.

  SHEPPARD
     (stunned) Rodney.

  MCKAY
     God, it's good to see you again.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard backs away.

  SHEPPARD
     You're a hologram!

  MCKAY
     (with mock surprise) No...! Of course. I-I'm
     tapped into the city's, um, internal sensors, so
     I've got eyes and ears, so to speak. You look
     good!

  SHEPPARD
     You look...uh...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard passes his hand through McKay's chest.
     The hologram image falters as he pierces it. McKay
     looks down with mild interest, but no pain.

  SHEPPARD
     ...different.

  MCKAY
     Mmm. That's because you remember me the, uh, the
     way I was.

  SHEPPARD
     (becoming irritated) What, you mean earlier today?

  MCKAY
     (musing) Ah, it's funny, you know? I've spent the
     last twenty-five years of my life trying to figure
     out how to make this work, and I never once
     thought what I was going to say to you when you
     got here.

  SHEPPARD
     You can start by telling me what the hell's going
     on here!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts to pace.

  MCKAY
     Right, right. Okay, um...remember that mission
     report? SG-1 stepped through the 'gate. Their
     wormhole accidentally intersected with a solar
     flare, and they were sent back to 1969?

  SHEPPARD
     Uh...well, vaguely.

  MCKAY
     Well, something similar has just happened to you.

  SHEPPARD
     I was sent back in time?

  MCKAY
     Uh, no. In fact, you were sent forward, into the
     future.

  SHEPPARD
     How far into the future?

  MCKAY
     Huh. Interesting question. And one that was not
     easy to figure out. I had to determine the exact
     characteristics of the solar flare in question--

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney!

  MCKAY
     (hesitantly) 48,000 years, give or...take?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rocks back in shock.

  SHEPPARD
     This is a practical joke.

  MCKAY
     No, I'm afraid not. Freak accident. Sorry.

  SHEPPARD
     (upset) You're telling me I just travelled 48,000
     years into the future in ten seconds?!

  MCKAY
     (intrigued) I know. It is kind of cool when you
     think about it, isn't it.

  SHEPPARD
     (more upset) Surfing a thirty foot wave in Waimea
     is cool. Dating a supermodel is cool. This is not
     cool!

  MCKAY
     All right, calm down.

  SHEPPARD
     (stunned by a new thought) If I'm in the future,
     that means you're, uh...

  MCKAY
     Dead. Dead and buried and turned to dust a long,
     long time ago. Along with everyone you ever knew.
     There's no way of knowing what the state of human
     civilization is, whether it even...still exists. I
     mean, we've obviously abandoned this city.

  SHEPPARD
     (nonplussed) Yeah, obviously.

  MCKAY
     There's not enough power for you to 'gate back to
     Earth. And without a MALP, going anywhere else
     would be far too risky. It is entirely possible
     that you are the last human being alive.

  SHEPPARD
     (disturbed) You're not doing a very good job of
     cheering me up here.

  MCKAY
     Oh, consider yourself lucky, young man. While I
     was figuring out this plan, I had no way of
     knowing whether the city would even survive this
     long.

  SHEPPARD
     What plan?

  MCKAY
     I took advantage of some progress in hologram
     technology to create this simulation. I'm able to
     move anywhere inside the city. I'm fully
     interactive, and I'm designed to mimic the exact
     response and appearance of the great Doctor Rodney
     McKay.

  SHEPPARD
     Couldn't use anyone else, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay chuckles.

  MCKAY
     Funny. Um...I'm linked to the city's main systems,
     but I have an independent core drive which is
     sealed in the foundation of one of the outer
     buildings along with a Mark XII naquadah generator
     and a couple of other, uh, well, key components.
     It's kind of like a, um, well, what would you
     say...? Like a time capsule, so to speak.

  SHEPPARD
     It's really nice to have company, but, if what
     you're saying is true, what good does it do me?

  MCKAY
     Oh, trust me, I wouldn't go to all this trouble
     just so we could have a chat. No...no, I'm here to
     bring you back. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay leads Sheppard out of the room.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Lights come on in each section as Sheppard and the
     holographic McKay pass, then turn off as the
     hologram moves out of range.

  SHEPPARD
     Where are we going?

  MCKAY
     Stasis chamber.

  SHEPPARD
     Why?

  MCKAY
     To buy some time.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, that really explains everything.

  MCKAY
     Theoretically, we can send you back exactly the
     way you got here, using the 'gate, the right
     address, and a solar flare. Only problem is, we're
     waiting for something very specific, a prominence
     with exactly the right shape, size,
     characteristics, and relative position in space so
     that it will interact with the wormhole in exactly
     the right manner, and send you back exactly the
     right amount of time.

  SHEPPARD
     And that doesn't happen every day.

  MCKAY
     Exactly.

  SHEPPARD
     How long are we talking about?

  MCKAY
     Oh, seven, eight hundred years. A thousand tops.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stops short.

  SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa, whoa. That-that's your plan?! I-I'm
     48,000 years into the future, and you want to put
     me on ice for another thousand?

  MCKAY
     Tops. Well, we need to be precise. If I don't get
     you back within two months of the moment you left,
     then...it'll be too late.

  SHEPPARD
     Too late? Wha-what the hell is that supposed to
     mean?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs.

  MCKAY
     Things didn't exactly go well for us after your
     disappearance. Once I figured out what happened to
     you, I realized there was nothing we could do. The
     Air Force pronounced you KIA--gave you a-a very
     nice military funeral back on Earth. Obviously,
     the casket was empty, but, uh, you know...it's the
     thought that counts. Heh. From there, well... From
     there, things went from bad to worse.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--WAREHOUSE, M2S-445, DAY


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon, McKay and Lorne's team sweep through the
     building, weapons raised.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) We kept searching for Teyla, but we
     just didn't have the resources to cover enough
     ground. It took us two months before we finally
     found her, in one of Michael's hideouts. But by
     then it was too late.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon crouches down by Teyla, checking her pulse.
     Rodney has tears in his eyes as he realizes she is
     not alive.

  MCKAY
     (sadly) She'd had the baby. I guess...after that,
     he didn't have any use for her anymore...So he
     killed her.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard both look devastated.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay head down another corridor.

  MCKAY
     It's not your fault!

  SHEPPARD
     I should've been there.

  MCKAY
     (sighing) And you will be. And...knowing the
     address where we eventually found Teyla, you will
     be able to get there much quicker. You know, save
     Teyla, save the baby, change the fate of the
     galaxy.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you mean?

  MCKAY
     (animated) Well, it was the turning point. It was
     the key to everything. Once Michael had that baby,
     he was able to complete his research and perfect
     the hybrids.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--VILLAGE, DAY

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) After that, well, he really kicked
     things into gear.


LOCATION--MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL

  ANNOTATION
     Atlantis medical personnel treat patients in the
     hospital. Keller passes a blanket over a patient
     who's died, looking distraught.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) He stepped up his campaign of exposing
     human populations to the Hoffan drug. Jennifer did
     her best to find a way to combat the effects and
     was trying to lower the mortality rate, but
     ultimately, it was a losing battle.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Wraith hive ships fire on each other in a pitched
     battle.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) With their food supplies tainted, the
     infighting between the Wraith factions got worse.
     Michael waited until they were at each other's
     throats...and then he made his move.

  ANNOTATION
     Another hive ship drops out of hyperspace.


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S HIVE SHIP BRIDGE

  MICHAEL
     Status?

  HYBRID
     Both hives are heavily damaged. They've lost
     hyperdrive and are venting atmosphere.

  MICHAEL
     Well, then, let's finish it.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Michael's hive ship fires on both other ships,
     destroying them.


LOCATION--TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Two hybrid soldiers drag in a Wraith queen. She
     struggles but is too weak to resist. They force
     her to kneel.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) He took advantage of their weakened
     state and their internal divisions, and in less
     than a year, he had the Wraith on their knees.
     Literally.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael stands in the tent, fingering the
     sharpness of a knife.

  MICHAEL
     You know, the irony is, I never asked for any of
     this. I was taken prisoner by the humans.
     Tortured. Experimented on. And when I finally
     escaped and returned to my Wraith brothers,
     instead of being welcomed back, I was met with
     scorn.

  QUEEN
     You will pay for this.

  MICHAEL
     (sneering) You still have your pride. Good for
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     He slashes with the knife, and the queen's
     headless body falls.


LOCATION--ENCAMPMENT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Michael steps out of the tent to stand before his
     hybrid army. He raises the decapitated head of the
     Wraith queen, and his troops cheer.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS STAIRWELL

  MCKAY
     With the Wraith in disarray, Michael returned to
     the human populations he'd infected with the
     Hoffan drug. He selected the strongest and the
     healthiest of the survivors and converted them to
     hybrids. The rest he exterminated.

  SHEPPARD
     You think by saving Teyla, we can change all this?

  MCKAY
     I know it. All I have to do is get you safely to a
     stasis chamber. I will reprogram the sensors...

  ANNOTATION
     The arrive in a corridor. It is filled with sand.

  MCKAY
     (deflating) Oh. That could be a problem.

  SHEPPARD
     No, no. That's not a problem. We'll just find
     another way around.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's image flickers.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     There is no other way around.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay walk closer to the sand.

  MCKAY
     The sand has penetrated the lower levels.

  SHEPPARD
     48,000 years into the future, you've still got a
     knack for stating the obvious. All right, what do
     we do?

  MCKAY
     I don't know.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you mean, you don't know?

  MCKAY
     (defensively) Well, I wasn't programmed for this
     variable.

  SHEPPARD
     You said you had twenty-five years to work on this
     plan.

  MCKAY
     Well, McKay did! And he brilliantly anticipated a
     lot of potential problems. It's just
     that...well...this wasn't one of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard starts heading back the way they came.

  SHEPPARD
     (thinking quickly) All right. Go up two levels,
     turn right, there's an outer door. It's only a
     quarter mile across the plaza.

  MCKAY
     You can't do that.

  SHEPPARD
     Why not?

  MCKAY
     Not only is it extremely hot out there, but for
     the last half an hour, the barometric pressure has
     been dropping, and the wind speeds have increased
     significantly.

  SHEPPARD
     Storm's coming.

  MCKAY
     A sandstorm. You ever been in one of those?!

  SHEPPARD
     As a matter of fact, I have!

  MCKAY
     Oh. Oh, then-then you know what that means.

  SHEPPARD
     It's not like we have a lot of options, here.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts jogging to the stairs. The hologram
     reluctantly follows.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard arrives at the closed outer door. He can
     hear the wind whipping furiously outside. McKay
     arrives.

  SHEPPARD
     Sounds pretty nasty out there.

  MCKAY
     The winds are gusting over fifty miles an hour and
     increasing. The visibility's basically zero. You
     can't go out there. You're just gonna have to wait
     it out.

  SHEPPARD
     For how long?

  MCKAY
     Well, I don't know. Maybe a couple of hours?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sighs and collapses against the wall.

  MCKAY
     (concerned) Are you hungry? Do you have any food?

  SHEPPARD
     (shaking his head) Nah.

  MCKAY
     Aw, well, I suppose it doesn't really matter
     anyways. We'll just wait for the storm to blow
     over and have you out of here in no time at all.
     Well, you'll actually be here for 700 years, but,
     uh...you know what I mean.

  SHEPPARD
     What about everyone else? I mean, you told me
     about Teyla, but what about the rest of them?
     There's no way we would've rolled over and let
     Michael take over the whole galaxy.

  MCKAY
     (quietly) No.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, what happened?

  MCKAY
     The IOA and the military were reluctant to commit
     a lot of resources to protecting the human
     populations of another galaxy. But Sam..? Heh. Sam
     wouldn't take no for an answer.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--PHOENIX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay tour the corridors, watching
     personnel assemble and set up new systems.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Finally, they decided to give her a
     new ship, the Phoenix. It was barely off the
     assembly line. Half the Asgard systems weren't
     finished, the other half...weren't working.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles. McKay looks more pessimistic.


LOCATION--PHOENIX AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay work on different systems.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) We spent the better part of a month
     getting her ready for combat. We worked day and
     night, side by side. Zelenka might have been there
     as well, I don't really remember.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka passes by, leaving McKay a cup of coffee.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) I do remember never feeling so drained
     in my entire life.


LOCATION--PHOENIX CORE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay places the last crystal in the Asgard
     computer. Carter smiles and checks off something
     on her tablet computer. McKay sighs and they both
     look around.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Eventually though, we managed to get
     her in working order.


LOCATION--PHOENIX BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stares out the bridge window. McKay enters.

  MCKAY
     All right, everything checks out. Weapons,
     shields, long-range sensors, all in the green.
     She's good to go.

  CARTER
     Great work, Rodney. Now I want you, Radek, and
     your team to head back to Atlantis and take a
     couple of days off. When you're good and rested,
     get to work on the city's shields. Do anything you
     can to maximize efficiency. You're going to need
     them.

  MCKAY
     Well, what about you?

  CARTER
     I'm going to take her out. For the time being,
     Major Lorne is in command of Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks worried.

  MCKAY
     You need to take some time. You're as exhausted as
     we are!

  CARTER
     Intel suggests that Michael's about to move
     against several human worlds. We have to get out
     there now.

  MCKAY
     (petulantly) Well, so let someone else go!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gives McKay a look.

  MCKAY
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to go.

  CARTER
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns back.

  MCKAY
     Hmm?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at him expectantly.

  MCKAY
     (shrugging) Uh...Good luck?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gives a wistful smile.

  CARTER
     Thanks, Rodney...

  ANNOTATION
     She hugs him.

  CARTER
     ...for everything.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks uncomfortable and saddened. As she
     steps back, he mutters awkwardly. He leaves Carter
     alone on the bridge, where she looks out the
     window, her expression melancholy.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) They started a series of hit-and-run
     ops, real guerrilla style.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Phoenix arrives and destroys one Wraith hybrid
     ship with its weapons as it passes, also firing on
     the hybrid's sister ship.


LOCATION--PHOENIX BRIDGE

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     One of the hives has been neutralized.

  CARTER
     What about the other one?

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     Minimal damage. They're powering weapons.

  CARTER
     Damn it.

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     Should we swing around for another pass?

  CARTER
     Forget it. Get us out of here.

  MCKAY
     For a while, it really worked. They were able to
     inflict, uh, considerable damage despite terrible
     odds. But, eventually, their luck ran out.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard blinks and looks saddened.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Phoenix exits hyperspace above a planet with a lot
     of water.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Michael deliberately leaked some intel
     that he was about to attack a heavily populated
     human world. Sam thought she could get there
     first...but she was wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     A hive ship already orbits the planet, waiting in
     ambush for the Phoenix. It immediately starts
     firing on the ship.


LOCATION--PHOENIX BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Explosions rock the bridge. Carter helps with
     repairs.

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     We've got a hive ship, six o'clock!

  CARTER
     It's an ambush.

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     Here comes another one. Dead ahead.

  CARTER
     Evasive maneuvers!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Phoenix tries to dodge blasts, but two more hive
     ships start to surround the 304, firing their
     weapons.


LOCATION--PHOENIX BRIDGE

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     We're boxed in.

  CARTER
     Return fire!

  ANNOTATION
     An explosion on the bridge knocks the man in the
     port station out of his chair. He falls back with
     a pained cry. Another crew member hurries to take
     his place.

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     We've lost Asgard weapons!

  CARTER
     (to helmsman) Switch to missiles. Fire all
     batteries. (to crew member) Help him. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes the port station as the crew member goes
     to help the wounded member.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Phoenix is barraged by heavy fire as it fires
     its missiles.


LOCATION--PHOENIX BRIDGE

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     We've got an overload. It's the hyperdrive.

  CARTER
     Reroute the power.

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     No response. System is going critical.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves from one system to another.

  CARTER
     I'm beaming you to the planet. Head to the 'gate
     as soon as you can.

  FEMALE HELMSMAN
     What about you?

  CARTER
     (firmly) I'll be right behind you!

  ANNOTATION
     The helmsman is beamed away.


LOCATION--PHOENIX CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     People are beamed away throughout the ship.


LOCATION--PHOENIX BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves from station to station, setting
     controls.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) After she got the crew off, she must
     have lost the transport system. With her engines
     about to go critical, I guess she figured she
     didn't have anything to lose.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Phoenix makes a wide turn within the boxed areas
     and heads full speed ahead as blasts continue to
     strike the ship.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stands stoically by her chair watching the
     window.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Phoenix rams one of the hive ships, the resulting
     explosion destroying the other two.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) With her last breath, she took out
     three of Michael's hive ships.

  ANNOTATION
     The sun begins to set, the light dimming
     throughout the city.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR OUTER DOOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay reappears near Sheppard, who's standing and
     waiting impatiently. McKay looks very worried.

  SHEPPARD
     Where the hell have you been?

  MCKAY
     I was inputting our...new solar flare requirements
     into the long-range sensors, and...I found out
     what happened to the ocean.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, you going to tell me, or are you going to
     keep it a secret?

  MCKAY
     (fiercely) The sun in this system is dying! It's
     running out of fuel.

  SHEPPARD
     Wouldn't that make it colder?

  MCKAY
     No. As it consumes the heavier elements, it begins
     to expand. It-it's basically turning into a red
     giant.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, so mystery solved. Let's move on.

  MCKAY
     No, no. You don't get it. This isn't some kind
     of...cyclical climate change. This is-this is a
     one-way ticket. This planet is going to get hotter
     and hotter. Eventually the atmosphere is going to
     burn off.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, how long before that happens?

  MCKAY
     It is impossible to say, but my best estimate is
     under five hundred years.

  SHEPPARD
     You said I'd be in stasis for at least seven
     hundred!

  MCKAY
     Right. So the moment you step out of the stasis
     chamber, you'll be killed.

  SHEPPARD
     (angrily) Come on, Rodney, you gotta think of
     something.

  MCKAY
     (frustrated) I am trying! It's like I said...

  SHEPPARD
     You didn't anticipate the variable. I get it! All
     right, can-can the Mark XII, uh, power the
     shields?

  MCKAY
     Theoretically, but...there would never be enough
     power left over to maintain my systems, the
     long-range sensors, the stasis chamber...

  SHEPPARD
     The city has solar power generators, right?

  MCKAY
     (caustically) Yes, which would come in very handy
     if we were trying to power a couple of electric
     golf carts.

  SHEPPARD
     See, you're still thinking like the old McKay.

  MCKAY
     I can't really help that! Look, what are you
     saying?

  SHEPPARD
     The sun's going red giant, right? Increased solar
     energy. The worse it gets, the more power we'll
     have.

  MCKAY
     Oh my god. That could work. We'll use the shields
     to protect the atmosphere.

  SHEPPARD
     (snapping his fingers) Exactly.

  MCKAY
     We wouldn't be able to do it indefinitely, but it
     would buy us a hundred years or so.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard pulls out a bandanna, tying it around his
     neck like a kerchief.

  SHEPPARD
     It's going to have to do for now. Open up the
     door.

  MCKAY
     What about the storm?

  SHEPPARD
     It's been going on for seven hours. For all we
     know, it could go on for days.

  MCKAY
     It'll be dark soon.

  SHEPPARD
     All the more reason to get going. All I gotta do
     is walk in a straight line.

  MCKAY
     That may not be as easy as you think.

  SHEPPARD
     I never said I thought it would be easy. Look, I
     haven't eaten. I was hungry on my way back to
     Atlantis. The longer we wait, the weaker I get.

  MCKAY
     All right. Look, I can't go outside, but I-I can
     stay in contact with you over the radio.

  ANNOTATION
     Bandanna over his nose and throat, Sheppard puts
     on his sunglasses and stands in front of the door.
     They open. He heads out into the sandstorm.

  MCKAY
     (calling after him) Like you said, just keep
     walking in a straight line. You'll hit the
     building on the other side. Just feel your way to
     the door. I'll be waiting for you there!

  ANNOTATION
     The door closes.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Yeah, I hear you!

  MCKAY
     (over radio) How you doing?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Never better!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gets blown back by the storm, taking two
     steps back for every one step forward. He stumbles
     to his knees for a moment then gets back up.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Rodney?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I'm still here.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Tell me about Ronon.

  MCKAY
     What, now?

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Yes, now. Talk to me, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Right. Uh...well, after what happened to you,
     and...and then Teyla, i guess he didn't feel
     comfortable on the base anymore.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--ENCAMPMENT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon walks with other warriors through the camp.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) He persuaded Sam to let him go
     off-world and recruit a strike force. By this
     time, the galaxy was in a panic. Word was
     spreading that Michael's agenda was to wipe out
     Wraith and human alike. Ronon didn't have much
     trouble finding volunteers.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone in the encampment, men and women, gather
     around as Ronon when arrives in the center of
     camp. He looks pleased at their number.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, he watches as pairs of volunteers spar with
     each other in organized katas, moving as he counts
     off.

  RONON
     One. Two. Three.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) They were just simple villagers with
     no military experience, but he trained them in all
     forms of combat. He even convinced Sam to let him
     have some of our equipment: radios, explosives,
     P-90s. It wasn't long before he had himself a
     pretty effective combat force.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon supervises the unpacking of several Earth
     crates. They contain C4 and rifles, which get
     distributed to everyone.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon watches, pleased, as one of his volunteers
     shoots a target dummy with a P-90.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) They ran a few successful ops against
     some of Michael's ground facilities, and then one
     day...they got key piece of intel.


LOCATION--WRAITH LAB, DAY


LOCATION--WRAITH LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Two hybrid soldiers patrol the lab.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Michael had taken over a Wraith lab
     and was using it to create more of his hybrids.

  ANNOTATION
     A flash grenade goes off in front of them.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) They decided to take it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and his team enter, spreading out throughout
     the complex.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) That's when they ran into
     someone...unexpected.

  ANNOTATION
     As Ronon reaches a junction of corridors, he is
     taken by surprise. He turns, weapon raised, to
     face Todd the Wraith, who holds his weapon at
     Ronon and looks similarly startled.

  RONON
     What the hell are you doing here?

  TODD
     I suspect the same as you. Michael is using this
     facility to create more of his soldiers. I intend
     to destroy it.

  RONON
     By yourself?

  TODD
     There is something to be said for stealth over
     brute force.

  STRIKE FORCE MEMBER
     (over radio) Ronon, come in.

  RONON
     (into radio) Go ahead.

  STRIKE FORCE MEMBER
     (over radio) One of the guards must've got a
     signal off, because a cruiser just landed. We're
     about to be overrun!

  TODD
     As I was saying.

  STRIKE FORCE MEMBER TWO
     We have to abort.

  RONON
     Give me the C-4. Take the men back, meet up with
     second squad and then head for the 'gate. Signal
     me when you get there. Go!

  ANNOTATION
     The strike force member hands over the C-4, but
     hesitates a moment before leaving.

  TODD
     (studying Ronon) You intend to complete your
     mission?

  RONON
     (smiling) You're damn right.

  TODD
     As do I.

  ANNOTATION
     They mutually lower their weapons.

  TODD
     I was going to write an elaborate program designed
     to slowly create a fatal error in the primary
     capacitor, but I doubt there'll be time for that
     now.

  RONON
     I was just going to blow it up.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads forward.

  TODD
     (dryly) Naturally.

  ANNOTATION
     Todd follows.

  ANNOTATION
     As they make their way forward, they're met by
     hybrid soldiers and engage in hand-to-hand combat,
     slaying the enemy. Ronon dispatches one guard with
     a short-sword, then instinctively moves upon
     spotting a shadow, stopping his blade just before
     it reaches Todd's neck. Ronon freezes in place.

  RONON
     Force of habit.

  TODD
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     Todd looks down to show he has similarly stopped
     his hand from plunging a dagger directly into
     Ronon's heart.


LOCATION--WRAITH LAB CORE

  ANNOTATION
     Todd and Ronon enter.

  TODD
     This is it. If we detonate in here, the secondary
     explosions will certainly take out the entire
     facility.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon hurriedly sets up the C-4.

  RONON
     All right. You know another way out of here?

  TODD
     Follow me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon finishes and follows Todd to the exit, but
     they immediately encounter enemy fire.

  TODD
     Fall back!

  ANNOTATION
     They re-enter the room and take cover.

  HYBRID
     They're in here!

  TODD
     I suggest you detonate now while we still have a
     chance.

  RONON
     We'll wait for my people to clear, period.

  TODD
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     They start exchanging fire with the hybrid
     soldiers.

  TODD
     We can't hold them off forever.

  RONON
     Just keep firing.

  ANNOTATION
     They're able to fell two hybrid members, but more
     keep coming.

  STRIKE FORCE MEMBER TWO
     (over radio) Ronon, we've reached the 'gate!

  RONON
     (into radio) All right. I want you to head back
     now! No questions asked, is that understood?

  ANNOTATION
     Todd hits two more hybrid soldiers.

  STRIKE FORCE MEMBER TWO
     (over radio) Understood.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon shoots another soldier. Todd looks at Ronon.

  TODD
     Are we done?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks over at him and primes the detonator.

  RONON
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     They exchange rueful smiles as Ronon flips the
     toggle switch.

  MCKAY
     (heartbroken) I'm sorry. I...I wish some of these
     stories had happier endings...Sheppard? Sheppard!
     Are you still with me? Sheppard!

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to the door, which opens. Sheppard enters
     and collapses, falling through McKay, disrupting
     the hologram on his way to the floor.

  MCKAY
     Your bio-signature's barely registering! Sheppard!

     He stares down at the unmoving Sheppard.

  MCKAY
     Oh, god.

     Sheppard rolls over, taking the bandanna off his
     face.

  SHEPPARD
     (hoarsely) Rodney.

  MCKAY
     I'm still here. Look, I'd help you out, but
     I-I-I'm...uh...

  ANNOTATION
     He waves his hands helplessly. Sheppard pulls
     himself to a half-seated position against the
     wall.

  SHEPPARD
     How long was I out?

  MCKAY
     All night. Look, you don't look so good. Maybe we
     should get you in the stasis chamber as soon as
     possible.

  SHEPPARD
     Agreed.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS STASIS CHAMBER

  MCKAY
     I've already prepped the solar panels. You're good
     to go.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard walk to a control panel. It
     opens as McKay points to it.

  MCKAY
     Here. Take the first crystal. I've loaded all the
     intel we got on Michael after your
     disappearance...including the address where we
     found Teyla.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard takes the crystal.

  SHEPPARD
     You know, you never told me what happened to you.
     I mean...in the past.

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Oh, you don't want to hear about
     that.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, why not? Obviously you survived.

  MCKAY
     Only because I quit.

  SHEPPARD
     Quit what?

  MCKAY
     Atlantis. Stargate Command. The whole thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard raises his eyebrows.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that doesn't sound like you.

  MCKAY
     Yeah. Well, we were under new management.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Medical personnel appear harried as they move
     equipment.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) I was down in the infirmary, having
     suffered a, uh...well, pretty serious injury.

  ANNOTATION
     Behind one curtain, Keller examines McKay's
     finger.

  KELLER
     (unimpressed) It's a splinter.

  MCKAY
     That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

  KELLER
     All right. It's just...you've kind of come at a
     bad time. It's a little busy in here right now.

  ANNOTATION
     She rolls her eyes. McKay nods, looking at the
     bustle of activity.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I can see that.

  WOOLSEY
     Doctor Keller, Doctor McKay.

  ANNOTATION
     They look over to see Woolsey in an Atlantis
     uniform. McKay gets off the infirmary bed.

  MCKAY
     (unimpressed) Mister Woolsey. I understand you've
     managed to get yourself appointed our new
     commander.

  WOOLSEY
     That's right. I only wish it were under...better
     circumstances. May I ask what's going on here?

  KELLER
     Uh, we're organizing some medical supplies for one
     of our off-world refugee camps.

  WOOLSEY
     I see. Well, I'm going to have to ask you to stop.

  KELLER
     I'm sorry?

  WOOLSEY
     The IOA is initiating a new policy: immediate
     recall of all base personnel. From now on, we'll
     be focusing entirely on the defense of this city.
     Furthermore, Doctor, your department is going to
     be scaled back. Without the 'gate bridge and with
     the need to keep one ship in orbit at all times
     for defensive purposes, resupply is going to be
     difficult. We need to prioritize.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller look at Woolsey in shock.

  KELLER
     I don't understand this. I'm already understaffed
     as it is.

  WOOLSEY
     Only because you've overextended yourself with all
     these humanitarian efforts and your continued
     attempts to find an antidote for the Hoffan drug.
     Once you have refocused your attention back to the
     medical needs of this base and its personnel, I
     don't think you'll have a problem.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to leave.

  KELLER
     (furious) Wait a second! People are dying out
     there!

  WOOLSEY
     I know. And believe me, if I thought there was
     anything I could do about it, I would.

  MCKAY
     What about Michael?

  WOOLSEY
     Michael knows the defensive capabilities of this
     base and our ships. The IOA thinks it's highly
     unlikely he will launch an unprovoked attack.

  KELLER
     (upset) So, that's it, then? We're supposed to
     just stand back and let him take over the rest of
     the galaxy?

  WOOLSEY
     How many more of our own people have to die,
     Doctor? Colonel Sheppard, Colonel Carter, Ronon,
     Teyla, they were your friends.

  MCKAY
     (defensively) Sheppard is not dead.

  WOOLSEY
     (patronizing) Right. He's just been transported
     48,000 years into the future. I guess that makes
     him one of the lucky ones.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves. McKay looks to Keller, who's still
     upset.


LOCATION--KELLER'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Keller packs clothes into a suitcase.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) The idea of standing by and doing
     nothing while the rest of the galaxy was suffering
     was...was too much for Jennifer to take. The more
     I thought about it, the more I realized she was
     right.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and McKay enters.

  KELLER
     If you've come here to try to convince me to stay,
     Rodney, you're...wasting your time. I already made
     up my mind.

  MCKAY
     No. I've come here to tell you I'm leaving, too.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and McKay sit at a table, both wearing
     Daedalus jumpsuits.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) We went over it a thousand times,
     trying to imagine what we might have done
     differently. It was awful. At least we had each
     other.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller smiles sadly and squeezes McKay's hand.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller look at each other as they stand
     by the window that looks down over Earth.

  MCKAY

     Sheppard sheds his tactical vest.

  SHEPPARD

  MCKAY
     (affronted) Why do you find that so surprising?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm just saying, if we start monkeying around with
     this timeline here, there's no guarantee it's
     going to turn out the same for you two.

  MCKAY
     That's what I'm counting on.

  SHEPPARD
     And why is that? You survived; you got the girl;
     it doesn't sound so bad.

     own practice. Things were just starting to come
     together.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller pauses, wracked by several hoarse coughs.
     After she's done and pulls her hand away, she
     notices she's coughed up blood. She exchanges
     concerned looks with McKay.

  DOCTOR
     I'm sorry to say, but all her internal organs are

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Of course, no regular doctor could
     diagnose what was wrong with her. We wound up back
     at Stargate Command less than a year after we'd
     left. Complications due to repeated exposure to
     the Hoffan drug. No cure.

  ANNOTATION
     While the hologram McKay explains, the doctor in
     the flashback continues to explain his diagnosis
     to McKay, who becomes more devastated with each
     word. He looks over to Keller's bed, where she
     lies unconscious, tended by nurses.

  DOCTOR
     ...I'm so sorry.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands alone in a corridor, lost in his
     thoughts.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) I thought I was going to lose my mind.
     I didn't know what to do. After everything we'd
     been through, to have this happen was too much.
     And that's when I had my idea.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, looking inspired, heads off quickly.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Keller is awake and sees McKay enter.

  KELLER
     Hi.

  MCKAY
     (excited) Hey.

  KELLER
     (weakly) Where have you been?

  MCKAY
     I've been working!

  ANNOTATION
     He grins and waves the papers in his hand.

  KELLER
     Working? On what?

  MCKAY
     The solution. To everything. Well, you. This. All
     of this! I mean, Atlantis, Pegasus,
     Michael...everything!

  KELLER
     What are you talking about?

  MCKAY
     I'm going to change the timeline. I'm going to
     make it so none of this ever happened. I mean, you
     won't get sick, Teyla won't die, Michael won't
     complete his research, none of it.

  KELLER
     (sighing) Oh, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Okay, I've already worked out the basic plan. I
     mean, the details will be a bit more complicated.
     I'll probably have to create a whole new form of
     math just to do the calculations, but I-I know I
     can do it.

  KELLER
     What's done is done. You can't change the past.

  MCKAY
     No, you can. I can! And I'm going to...even if it
     takes the rest of my life.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes his hand.

  KELLER
     You think that's what I want?

  MCKAY
     (confused) Well, why not?

  KELLER
     (crying) The year I spent in Atlantis, I...I saw
     more things than people even dream about in their
     lifetime...I don't have any regrets.

  MCKAY
     (petulantly) Well, I do! I've got a whole boatload
     of them, and I want to do something about it.

  KELLER
     No. Just promise me that you're not going to waste
     the rest of your life chasing after something
     that's already gone.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay fights back tears.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) But I couldn't let it go. She died
     three days later.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S APARTMENT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works on calculations in a small, cluttered
     apartment.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) I quit the research firm. Took a job
     teaching physics at a local community college. Not
     much money, but it gave me the free time I needed.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Time has passed, and while McKay's outfit has
     changed, he still works on calculations. This time
     his sister Jeanie is with him.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) I'll admit it wasn't much of a life.
     Jeanie came by every once in a while to check up
     on me. When she realized she wasn't going to be
     able to convince me to stop, she decided to pitch
     in and help me with the calculations.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie erases part of a calculation on his
     whiteboard and replaces it with her own.

  MCKAY
     It's obviously nothing. I did that yesterday.
     Look--

  JEANIE
     Oh, you did not.

  MCKAY
     Look, look, this is what I'm thinking about
     doing...

  ANNOTATION
     They continue to bicker.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Eventually, even she got fed up. I
     never wavered.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S APARTMENT

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Years went by, twenty-five years to be
     exact. And suddenly I had it.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works on an advanced computer monitor,
     changing calculations using a glove on his hand.
     McKay has aged, looking the same as he does in the
     hologram image appearing to Sheppard. He looks at
     the finished work with satisfaction.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     An airman escorts McKay through the briefing room
     to the general's office.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) There was only one problem. I needed
     to get back to Atlantis. I didn't have a lot of
     friends at Stargate Command, but I only needed
     one.


LOCATION--LORNE'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Major General E. Lorne is the commander of the
     SGC. He stands to greet McKay. Among his office
     decorations are paintings he has done, including
     one of Atlantis he had been working on in
     "Sunday". Lorne moves slowly. His hair is greying
     and his face has some wrinkles.

  LORNE
     Doctor McKay. Good to see you.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands.

  MCKAY
     General Lorne.

  LORNE
     Come on in, have a seat.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit.

  LORNE
     I, uh, I read your proposal.

  MCKAY
     You didn't tell anyone else, did you?

  LORNE
     I'm not quite as stupid as you might think, Doc.
     But I'm sorry, there-there's just no way I'd ever
     be able to get this authorized.

  MCKAY
     Well then, don't. You don't have to tell them what
     it is. I mean, tell them it's a research project.
     Tell them whatever the hell you want.

  LORNE
     Rodney...you're talking about altering the
     timeline here. Changing history. Changing
     everything! Do you really think that either of us
     has the right to make that call?

  MCKAY
     Let's cut to the chase. You saw what happened in
     Pegasus. You know what's happening here. You
     really think this is the way it's supposed to be?

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne sighs and looks torn.

  MCKAY
     Maybe he felt sorry for me, maybe he figured it
     wasn't going to work anyway, but...he let me
     through. The rest, you know.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard looks uncomfortable.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Well, I guess I've had a tough day, but
     you've had a tough...twenty-five years.

  MCKAY
     Okay, we're ready.

  ANNOTATION
     The stasis chamber opens. Sheppard steps inside
     it, looking uncertain.

  MCKAY
     Now if this works, I'll be waiting right here when
     you come out. We don't have much time to get you
     through the 'gate, but I think we can manage it.

  SHEPPARD
     And if it doesn't work?

  MCKAY
     Well, you won't feel a thing. Basically, you just
     won't wake up.

  SHEPPARD
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     They both shift awkwardly.

  SHEPPARD
     In the past twenty-five years, you happen to
     notice who won the Superbowl?

  MCKAY
     Oh, uh, afraid not.

  SHEPPARD
     Ah. Stanley Cup? No. World Series?

  MCKAY
     (shaking his head) I was never really much of a
     sports fan.

  SHEPPARD
     Right. Had to ask.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay waves his hand.

  MCKAY
     Good luck, John.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is frozen in stasis. The McKay hologram
     dematerializes.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate chevrons start locking.

  CHUCK
     Unscheduled off-world activation!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay head to Chuck's station.

  CARTER
     What have you got?

  CHUCK
     Receiving IDC. (surprised) It's Colonel Sheppard.

  CARTER
     Lower the shield.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay hurry down the steps.

  CARTER
     Security!

  ANNOTATION
     SFs arrive, aiming their guns warily at the
     wormhole. Sheppard leaps through, raising his
     hands immediately at the guards' weapons as the
     wormhole shuts down.

  SHEPPARD
     Whoa! Whoa.

  CARTER
     John...

  SHEPPARD
     (nonplussed) Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stares around in awe and relief.

  SHEPPARD
     It worked. It worked. Rodney, you're a genius.

  MCKAY
     Okay...

  CARTER
     John, what happened?

  SHEPPARD
     How much time has gone by?

  CARTER
     You've been missing for twelve days.

  SHEPPARD
     (muttering to himself) Twelve days, twelve
     days...okay. She wouldn't have had her baby yet.
     (to Carter) Look, I know this sounds kinda weird,
     but we're on the clock.

  CARTER
     John, what are you talking about?

  SHEPPARD
     I know where Teyla is.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay exchange looks.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Atlantis sits in the ocean in the present day.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard paces impatiently in the room. Carter is
     with him.

  SHEPPARD
     (frustrated) We don't have time for this!

  CARTER
     John, there are procedures we have to follow. You
     know that.

  SHEPPARD
     I am not a clone. Is that what you're worried
     about?

  CARTER
     No, your medical came back clean. Telomeres and
     all. But there are other things we need to
     discuss. I mean, you have to admit, this is a
     pretty wild story, even for this place.

  SHEPPARD
     But that's my whole point. How could I make this
     up?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Sam, believe it or not, I found it.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between
     McKay's and Carter and Sheppard's locations.

  MCKAY
     It's in the sensor log. It's a solar flare capable
     of interfering with the wormhole from M4S-587 at
     exactly the moment that Lorne says he dialed.

  CARTER
     Well, why didn't the 'gate's fail-safe prevent the
     wormhole from locking?

  MCKAY
     (awkwardly) Uh...Well, we've had a number of
     glitches since we, uh, last updated the operating
     system.

  SHEPPARD
     (piqued) Oh, that's what you call a glitch, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks guilty as he glances at Chuck.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well...you should know that, uh, I'll be
     giving Zelenka a stern talking to.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Carter) Can we go now?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods, and they leave the room.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team, Lorne's team, and another marine
     team check their weapons as the Stargate is
     dialed.

  MCKAY
     (to Sheppard) Look, um, I know you've already been
     debriefed about the, uh, future events, all the
     things we're hoping to avoid, but there's just one
     more thing I need to know.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     Do I still have hair?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon rolls his eyes. Sheppard pauses, considering
     his answer.

  SHEPPARD
     (lying) No. (to everyone) Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     They head out, McKay pausing for a moment while he
     digests Sheppard's answer.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT



LOCATION--WAREHOUSE, M2S-445, DAY


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     The teams sweep through the warehouse. They split
     up. Ronon and Sheppard go one way with some of the
     team. McKay and Lorne go another.

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne and McKay check out a room.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Rodney, you got anything?

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Hold on. Yeah....yeah, I got some
     kind of a-a data terminal. Let me see if I can
     power it up and hack in.

  ANNOTATION
     He approaches the Wraith-style device.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE NURSERY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon approach the room.

  SHEPPARD
     This is it. This is where they found her.

  RONON
     How do you know?

  SHEPPARD
     Because he described it to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon groans, but they sweep into the room. It is
     empty. Sheppard checks out one side, while Ronon
     passes a Wraith-style incubator and other
     equipment to look at some large, sharp blades on a
     table. He holds up a very wide and jagged one.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey. Look at this.


LOCATION--WRAITH DATA TERMINAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works on the data terminal.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) McKay, we got something.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between the
     McKay's and Sheppard's locations.

  SHEPPARD
     Some twisted version of a maternity ward. I think
     we're too early though, but he's going to bring
     her here to have the baby.

  MCKAY
     Hold on. I'm in.

  ANNOTATION
     A display comes up on the screen.

  MCKAY
     Whoa! Jackpot.

  SHEPPARD
     What have you got?

  MCKAY
     I got everything. I've got gate addresses. I've
     got subspace communication codes. I've even got
     his research into the hybrids. He's history!

  ANNOTATION
     He exchanges triumphant smiles with Lorne. Behind
     him, the screen shorts out. A new display comes
     up, showing symbols appearing at timed intervals,
     along with a beeping.

  MCKAY
     No, no, no. No, no, no, no. What happened?

  LORNE
     What's that?

  ANNOTATION
     He stands, looking very worried.

  MCKAY
     Oh, no...

  LORNE
     (nervously) Doc?

  MCKAY
     It's a countdown.

  ANNOTATION
     From both locations, a distant rumbling can be
     heard. The building shakes.

  LORNE
     Colonel, it's a booby trap. We've got to get out
     of here now!

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne and McKay race for the door, but a girder
     falls, blocking their path. The floor shakes
     beneath them, keeping them unbalanced.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon dodge falling debris as they
     try to get to the exit. Every way is quickly
     becoming blocked.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE, M2S-445, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The building collapses.
