LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Sheppard gather food from the line.

  RONON
     Are you sure you don't want to spend your leave
     going back to Earth with McKay and the others?

  SHEPPARD
     Nah. The SGC doesn't have a ZPM, so two weeks on
     Earth means, uh, three weeks cooped up in the
     Daedalus. That's uh, five weeks of missing work.
     We only get one of those every year and a half, so
     I'd like to save mine for something more special.

  RONON
     (dubious) So we're going camping instead?

  SHEPPARD
     On a beach that's never been surfed or even
     touched. You know, you gotta get a little more
     excited about this.

  RONON
     (unenthusiastic) Uh-huh.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard spots McKay and Keller sitting at a table
     together.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, check that out.

  RONON
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     You think he's ever going to make a move?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks up just as Keller laughs at something
     McKay said.

  RONON
     Who cares?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon walks away.

  SHEPPARD
     (pensive) Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     He notices Ronon's gone and follows.

  MCKAY
     Say...I know we only get...fourteen days on Earth
     a year, and-and...you miss your dad and all...

  KELLER
     But...?

  MCKAY
     See, one of my old...guy who was doing his
     doctorate the same time as me...he's giving a big
     secret presentation about some new thing that he's
     working on and everyone and anyone in the physics
     community is going to be there, and...well...See,
     the thing is, there's this perception out there
     that, uh, I'm um...like, a washout, recluse.

  KELLER
     Why?

  MCKAY
     Well, because I do this for a living. I mean,
     super double tip-top secret stuff. I mean, I
     haven't published a paper in a decade&emdash;not
     one that can be read by the general public, and
     I'm kinda hard to get ahold of, what with living
     in another galaxy and all.

  KELLER
     Yeah, I know what that's like.

  MCKAY
     Exactly! They think I'm a shut-in. So...I was
     thinking...that, um, if I was to, say, show up
     with a woman...

  KELLER
     Uh-huh.

  MCKAY
     A-a beautiful woman...that, um, they would maybe
     not think that I was...like, a complete loser.
     Like, it would be, like, one day. The first night
     we were there, and then you could be off to
     Chippewa Falls. I mean, it could be fun?

  KELLER
     (coyly) Hmm. Well, let's see. Uh, a room full of
     physicists, um, a long-winded presentation I
     probably won't understand. Yeah, it doesn't really
     sound like fun.

  MCKAY
     (hopefully) Well, there'll be drinks probably, and
     maybe those little sandwiches? And...me! I'll be
     there.

  KELLER
     (frustrated) You don't have to fabricate all these
     reasons on why youneed me to be with you. You
     could just ...ask me out on a date.

  MCKAY
     Hey, I didn't want to...I mean, I know you...

  KELLER
     I'll probably say yes.

  MCKAY
     Well, you...you want to go to this thing with me?

  KELLER
     Sure. I'd love to.

  MCKAY
     Well, I'd love-- I mean, that's...Good! Good.
     Great. That's...

  KELLER
     It's a date.

  MCKAY
     (sighing in relief) That's a date.

  KELLER
     So, what's the presentation?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. I...he doesn't want to tell anyone
     until we all get there. But, uh, if I know this
     guy, it'll be, you know, first-class presentation
     with like, second-rate science. Probably some
     minor adjustment to someone else's work, but, um,
     the food'll be good.

  ANNOTATION
     They get up and walk out of the mess hall
     together.

  KELLER
     And the company.

  MCKAY
     Mmm.


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS FACILITY, NIGHT


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm checks his data. Kramer enters, holding a
     paper report.

  KRAMER
     Malcolm, have you read this?

  MALCOLM
     Yes.

  KRAMER
     Your staff thinks it's reckless to turn this thing
     on tomorrow.

  MALCOLM
     Some of my staff.

  KRAMER
     (admonishing) Malcolm...

  MALCOM
     They're just getting cold feet, that's all. Do you
     remember all that stuff that came out before CERN
     turned on the LHC? You know, miniature black
     holes, exotic particles, strangelets, the
     instantaneous destruction of the planet? All
     unfounded histrionics. We are going to be just
     fine.

  KRAMER
     So you're saying none of these potential
     catastrophes is going to happen?

  MALCOM
     Well, there is always the slight possibility that
     something might go wrong.

  KRAMER
     The Cause has a lot riding on this.

  MALCOLM
     Don't worry about it. Your precious "cause" will
     come out of this squeaky clean tomorrow.

  KRAMER
     Some of these worst-case scenarios are terrifying.

  MALCOLM
     (cutting him off) Of course they're terrifying!
     They're worst-case scenarios. They are the worst
     possible thing that could ever happen, ever!
     (sighing) Tomorrow's going to come off without a
     hitch. We've done hundreds of tests. There is zero
     possibility for failure.

  ANNOTATION
     Kramer doesn't look as sanguine.

  MALCOLM
     (smiling confidently) Trust me.


LOCATION--UNITED STATES AIRSPACE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A small private Learjet flies across the
     countryside.


LOCATION--PRIVATE JET

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller sit across from each other in the
     cabin of the plane. Keller is in a black cocktail
     dress, sipping champagne. McKay is in a tuxedo.

  KELLER
     This is exciting.

  MCKAY
     (chuckling) Well, it's just a plane.

  KELLER
     Yeah, but I've never even flown first-class. I
     mean, this is...amazing. Have you tried these
     strawberries?

  MCKAY
     When I was ten, I ate a bowl full of strawberries
     and threw up. I haven't been able to stomach them
     since.

  KELLER
     How does this guy afford all this? I thought he
     was just a physicist.

  MCKAY
     Well, he was always able to dupe guys with deep
     pockets into backing his research, you know? It's
     amazing what a nice smile and a PowerPoint
     presentation will get you.

  KELLER
     Well, I am impressed.

  MCKAY
     (primly) Yes. I can see that.

  KELLER
     Oh, come on. You should be happy for your friend's
     success.

  MCKAY
     Well, it's more of an acquaintance than a friend.

  KELLER
     Acquaintances don't pick you up in private planes.

  MCKAY
     (scoffing) He didn't send the jet to be nice; he
     sent the jet to rub it in my face. Look, I was
     always one step ahead of this guy during school,
     and now that we're in the "real world", he wants
     to show me that, as far as most of the planet is
     concerned, he's a lot more successful than I am.
     And what is with the evening attire? We're going
     to a science talk, for god's sake. Who the hell
     does he think he is?

  KELLER
     I-is this is going to be what the whole day is
     going to be like? Are you going to be in a bad
     mood?

  MCKAY
     (chastised) No.

  KELLER
     'Cause we're back on Earth in a private jet,
     drinking expensive champagne, and your date's
     wearing a fancy dress. Most people would be having
     a good time, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     You're right. You're right. Hmm?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay picks up a strawberry and takes a bite. As
     he chews he spots a picture behind Keller of
     Malcolm with the Dalai Lama. He puts down the
     strawberry and grimaces in distaste.


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS FACILITY, DAY


LOCATION--KRAMER REGISTRATION AREA

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller step up to the registration desk.

  MCKAY
     McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay. Doctor Jennifer
     Keller.

  ANNOTATION
     Security checks their names off a list.

  SECURITY
     Yes, welcome. I'll just need you both to sign this
     non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.

  ANNOTATION
     He slaps two large reams of paper in front of
     them.

  MCKAY
     Oh, you're not serious.

  SECURITY
     Is there a problem, sir?

  MCKAY
     This whole thing is a confidentiality agreement?

  SECURITY
     Yes, sir.

  MCKAY
     Well, what could he possibly be doing back there
     that needs to be kept two hundred pages secret?

  SECURITY
     (firmly) If you want to go inside, sir, you need
     to sign the agreement.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller starts to sign hers.

  MCKAY
     Dinosaurs?

  SECURITY
     Excuse me?

  MCKAY
     Do they have living dinosaurs back there? Because
     I'll sign this if he's brought dinosaurs back to
     life. But short of that, he is out of his mind if
     he thinks I am going to pretend that whatever
     discovery he has made is so important and so
     secret that I have to sign the unabridged works of
     William Shakespeare here!

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakes her head and hands McKay her pen.

  KELLER
     (annoyed) Just sign it. Here you go.

  ANNOTATION
     Abashed, McKay takes the pen and signs.

  MCKAY
     (defensively) Oh. You're just lucky the lady's
     here, aren't you?


LOCATION--RECEPTION AREA

  ANNOTATION
     Several people mill around, sipping cocktails and
     making small talk. Keller and McKay are near the
     center. McKay has a plate filled with small
     sandwiches.

  KELLER
     Where do you think we are?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. Arizona? Nevada? I didn't think
     people even built secret facilities anymore. It
     seems so...1950s.

  NYE
     Rodney McKay?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and McKay turn to see Bill Nye and Neil
     DeGrasse Tyson approaching them.

  NYE
     I had it on good authority that you were dead.

  MCKAY
     (unamused) Oh. Ha ha.

  TYSON
     And this would be your...sister?

  MCKAY
     No. No, Neil, you know, she's not my sister. This
     is Jennifer Keller. That's Bill Nye and (mumbling)
     Neil Degrasse Tyson.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakes hands with them both. Keller stares
     at Tyson as if remembering something.

  TYSON
     You know, from television.

  KELLER
     (blinking) Yeah. Uh...of course. Very nice to meet
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     She smiles and bites her lip.

  TYSON
     (charming) No, the pleasure's mine.

  MCKAY
     And, she's taken, Neil.

  TYSON
     No, no, I didn't mean it that way. No!

  MCKAY
     Neil likes to steal things from me, things like
     women and theoretical physics ideas.

  TYSON
     (to Nye) Yeah, but who hasn't stolen an idea from
     the "great" Rodney McKay.

  MCKAY
     (preening) Oh, so we admit it now?

  NYE
     (to Keller) See, back in the day, whenever any one
     of these people came up with a new idea or
     published an new paper, Dr. McKay here would swear
     that he was already working on something very
     similar--just hadn't gotten around to publishing
     it yet.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shoots McKay a sympathetic smile while
     McKay steams.

  TYSON
     He'd say things like, "I was about to say that
     very same thing!" Or, "I was just about to have
     that...same idea."

  ANNOTATION
     Nye rolls his eyes sarcastically and twirls his
     finger in miming agreement to Tyson.

  MCKAY
     Hey, at least I didn't declassify Pluto from
     planet status. Way to make all the little kids
     cry, Neil. That make you feel like a big man?

  NYE
     See, thanks to Dr. Tyson, Pluto is now the first
     of the Plutoids--a new class of celestial object.
     It's cool! Come on, Rodney, it's the 21st century!

  TYSON
     Actually, come to think of it, when was the last
     time you even published a paper? It was like, the
     80s?

  MCKAY
     (startled) It...hasn't been that long.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller frowns as she follows the conversation.

  NYE
     I think I was listening to that band, A Flock of
     Seagulls, while I was reading it.

  ANNOTATION
     He chuckles and looks at Keller, who smiles
     politely and ducks her head.

  TYSON
     Actually, it might have been pre-Reagan.

  MCKAY
     (drily) Well, it has been great running into you
     guys. We should...maybe get our seats.

  KELLER
     Bye.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay walks away. Keller follows. Nye watches them
     go with a slow whistle.

  TYSON
     They can't possibly be dating.

  NYE
     I know. Well, Neil, you're married, so...

  ANNOTATION
     Tyson flashes his wedding ring.

  NYE
     Dibs.

  TYSON
     (chuckling) She's all yours.


LOCATION--CARL BINDER MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM

  ANNOTATION
     People take their seats in the auditorium.

  MCKAY
     I think maybe this was a bad idea.

  KELLER
     Why?

  MCKAY
     Well, I just...remembered I don't...really like
     these people.

  KELLER
     Is it that...you don't like them, or maybe, they
     don't like you?

  MCKAY
     Hmm, possibly. I mean I...I used to be a
     little...abrasive?

  KELLER
     Oh, used to be, yeah.

  MCKAY
     Well, it's hard to explain. I mean my...field is
     very competitive.

  KELLER
     (drily) Yeah, I went to med school for six years.
     I wouldn't know anything about that.

  MCKAY
     Oh...right.

  KELLER
     Not everything has to be a competition, Rodney.
     They know how smart you are.

  MCKAY
     I'm not sure they do.

  KELLER
     Of course they do. You don't have to keep
     reminding them. It's called being humble. Have
     you...heard that word before?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay shoots her a look and scoffs.

  KELLER
     Look, we're on our first date and I've come to a
     physics talk, okay? You have to bend a little bit
     too.

  MCKAY
     Humble, eh? I guess I can try anything once.

  ANNOTATION
     She holds his hand. He smiles at her as the lights
     lower. New Age music plays as a revolving Earth
     appears on the screen.

  MALCOLM
     (voiceover) Earth. Our home. Our planet. The very
     vessel of life. Our world--unique, irreplaceable.
     And yet, at times, it seems like we are
     unrelenting in our quest o drive our ecosystem
     into catastrophic failure.

  ANNOTATION
     Pictures of pollution evidence appear across the
     globe.

  MALCOLM
     (continuing, voiceover) Gone unchecked, global
     warming will transform this lush world we know
     today into a lifeless and arid rock.

  ANNOTATION
     The Earth picture transforms into a dried up husk.

  MALCOLM
     (continuing, voiceover) Friends, the stakes
     couldn't be higher. The situation, no more dire.
     It's time...to act!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller exchange looks as the Earth
     picture dissolves and Malcolm's last name "TUNNEY"
     appears. Malcolm steps in front of the screen.

  MALCOLM
     Hello. I'm Malcolm Tunney.

  ANNOTATION
     The audience applauds politely.

  MCKAY
     (caustically, to Keller) If he's so worried about
     global warming, why'd he fly us here in a private
     jet? That spews out more CO2 than Sweden.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller snickers but shushes him.

  MALCOLM
     Thank you very much. You're very kind. As many of
     you know, I am not an environmental scientist. Nor
     do I pretend to be one. For instance, I shower
     regularly.

  ANNOTATION
     Many in the audience laugh.

  MALCOLM
     (looking at man in front row) No offense, Larry.

  ANNOTATION
     Larry, a large man with a long fuzzy white beard
     and wearing an unkempt suit, does not respond.

  MALCOLM
     I'm just a concerned citizen, one who realizes
     that the Earth has carried for us so long, maybe
     it's time that we...carried her.

  ANNOTATION
     As he speaks the Earth image appears again
     shrinking to look as if it fits on the palm of his
     hand.

  MCKAY
     (low, to Keller) That ratio would be accurate if
     his body was the size of his ego.

  KELLER
     (grimacing, speaking low) Yeah. It's a little
     much.

  MCKAY
     Mmm.

  ANNOTATION
     A flatter map image of the planet appears on the
     screen and a common symbol/pictogram of men and
     women scatter across the continents.

  MALCOLM
     Solving a problem like global warming may seem
     impossibly complex. So many nations, so many
     corporations, and John Q. Public will have to
     agree on a dizzying number of issues. So then...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks around to see the audience's reaction.
     The map image disappears and one male pictogram
     fills the screen.

  MALCOLM
     (continuing) ...what can one person do to make a
     difference? What can I...?

  ANNOTATION
     The pictogram transforms into a picture of
     Malcolm.

  MALCOLM
     ...with my particular and unique skill set, do to
     help?

  KELLER
     (sarcastic, to McKay) They think you're the
     arrogant one?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay harrumphs in agreement.

  MALCOLM
     I've been working on a number of projects over the
     last decade, and I realized that if I were to
     combine them, I just may be able to achieve
     something unexpected. So, ladies and gentlemen,
     with major funding from my friends at Kramer
     Innovations, I have been able to device a means to
     cool our planet in a safe and controlled way.

  ANNOTATION
     The screen image changes to Kramer Innovations'
     logo.

  KELLER
     This guy wouldn't know cool...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay ignores Keller, leaning forward, intrigued.
     Keller notices and pays more attention herself.
     The rest of audience is also murmuring in
     interest.

  MALCOLM
     Now, the science behind this is immensely complex.
     But...there will be detailed briefs handed out to
     you as you leave the lecture hall. But for right
     now, let me just give you the Cliffs Notes. It
     begins with a massive heat-sink, one of my own
     design, which steadily draws heat from the
     surrounding environment.

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows a schematic of the heat sink.

  KELLER AND MCKAY
     (muttering to themselves) Where does the heat go?

  MALCOLM
     (continuing his lecture) Where does that heat go,
     you may ask. Well, my friends, that is the hard
     part. I give you...the Tunney Space-Time Matter
     Bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows a heat transfer bridge between
     two space-time locations.

  MCKAY
     Wait...what?

  MALCOLM
     Now, this isn't just some theoretical math proof.
     This is a functioning piece of technology--one
     that literally moves heat from our space-time and
     vents it out into another space-time.

  MCKAY
     (shocked) That's my bridge...you know, my sister
     and I came up with that.

  ANNOTATION
     A man nearby turns and glares at McKay. Keller
     clutches McKay's arm.

  KELLER
     Shh. (to annoyed neighbor) Sorry.

  MALCOLM
     And...it works. We've been testing the system for
     a few months now, and it has proved to be
     remarkably stable.

  MCKAY
     (louder) That's my idea!

  KELLER
     (whispering) Rodney, now is not the time.

  MALCOLM
     For the purposes of the demonstration today, I
     have surrounded this facility with an electrified
     plasma grid that will contain the reach of the
     heat-sink. It will draw heat only from this
     facility.

  MCKAY
     (worried) Wait, he's going to turn it on with us
     here? I mean...that...this...this is a bad idea.

  KELLER
     (pleading in a whisper) Rodney, please!

  ANNOTATION
     The screen behind Malcolm shows 74 degrees -> 64
     degrees.

  MALCOLM
     And to prove the effectiveness of this system, I
     will lower the temperature within this facility by
     ten degrees. Oh, and don't worry, I've turned off
     the air conditioning, so there'll be no cheating.
     I promise.

  MCKAY
     (to Keller) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't let him do
     this.

  KELLER
     Oh, no. Rodney...

  MCKAY
     (standing, shouting) Excuse, me! Malcolm!

  MALCOLM
     (cheerily) Doctor McKay! Thank you for coming.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller looks around, embarrassed.

  MCKAY
     This is a bad idea.

  MALCOLM
     Well, we're not quite ready for the Q&A session
     yet, so if you could just wait 'til then.

  MCKAY
     Let's just...take a look at the data you've come
     up with...and-and talk about this, because turning
     the device on with all these people here could be
     very dangerous.

  MALCOLM
     Respectfully, I disagree.

  MCKAY
     Wh-y-you can't do something like this without our
     consent.

  AUDIENCE MEMBER
     Sit down!

  MALCOLM
     (blandly) You did sign the document when you
     entered, didn't you?

  MCKAY
     Well, yeah, I thought that was just...

  MALCOLM
     (cutting him off) Then I have your consent.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but--Look, I have been doing work that is
     very, very similar to this.

  MALCOLM
     (scoffing) Really? I...don't think that's
     possible.

  ANNOTATION
     Tyson shakes his head derisively.

  MCKAY
     Look, these bridges to other space times can be
     very unpredictable.

  MALCOLM
     Do you have any research you'd like to put forward
     right now? A paper, perhaps? Anything to back up
     your claim.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller sighs.

  MALCOLM
     Rodney, please, tell me this isn't just petty
     jealousy.

  KELLER
     (low) Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     She tugs on McKay's arm.

  MCKAY
     Well, no, no, I--I just...

  ANNOTATION
     He stumbles back into his seat, deflated.

  MALCOLM
     No, I-I didn't think so. Don't worry, everyone,
     this is completely safe. And...

  ANNOTATION
     He signals one of the staff who types a command on
     her laptop.

LOCATION--AUDITORIUM

  ANNOTATION
     The staff member nods and points to Malcolm.

  MALCOLM
     ...we're up and running. Now, I'll be happy to
     answer all your questions once you've had a chance
     to read the brief. But for now, why don't we all
     go back out to the lobby where hot cocoa is
     waiting, 'cause it's about to get very cold in
     here. Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm leaves the stage to applause. Keller leans
     over and puts her arm around McKay.

  MCKAY


  I...


  KELLER
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stammers incoherently.

  KELLER
     Let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?

  ANNOTATION
     She takes him by the hand and pulls him out of the
     room.


LOCATION--RECEPTION AREA

  ANNOTATION
     The scientists stand around talking and studying
     papers. In one area is a full size cutout of
     Malcolm, holding a beach-ball sized Earth. In the
     center of the globe is a thermometer that is
     showing the decreasing temperature of the room.
     Beside the cut out, away from the crowd, Keller
     stands by McKay, who is reading a copy of the
     brief.

  MCKAY
     (stammering) This is...this is...how did he even
     get a hold of my work?

  KELLER
     Are you sure this is your work?

  MCKAY
     Absolutely. Look, you believe me, don't you?

  KELLER
     Of course I do.

  MCKAY
     There is no way that he came up with this on his
     own. We gotta...we gotta...we...come on.

  ANNOTATION
     He jumps a velvet rope and heads to a back area,
     trashing the brief as he passes. Nervously, Keller
     follows.


LOCATION--MALCOLM'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sneaks into Malcolm's darkened office.
     Keller reluctantly follows.

  KELLER
     We shouldn't be in here.

  MCKAY
     Stand guard there.

  KELLER
     Why?

  MCKAY
     It'll take me a couple of seconds to hack into his
     computer.

  KELLER
     (exasperated) What are you doing?!


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS FACILITY, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The building is still shielded.


LOCATION--RECEPTION AREA

  ANNOTATION
     The thermometer shows the drop to 64 degrees.
     Everyone applauds.

  MALCOLM
     Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, but I don't think
     an achievement of this magnitude can truly be
     credited to one man.

  ANNOTATION
     The female staffer who had worked on her laptop
     approaches and taps Malcolm.

  STAFFER
     Dr. Tunney, sir.

  MALCOLM
     (to guests) Oh, excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away from them over to the side with the
     staffer.

  MALCOLM
     Yes? What is it?

  STAFFER
     Well, you told us to shut the device down once we
     reached 64.

  MALCOLM
     Yes, that's right. You can shut it down now.

  STAFFER
     Well, that's the problem, sir. We've tried. We've
     tried everything in fact. The device won't shut
     off.

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm's face falls as he watches the digital
     thermometer drop to 63 degrees.


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Several staff and security work controls under
     Kramer's supervision. Malcolm storms in with the
     female staffer close behind.

  KRAMER
     Malcolm!

  MALCOLM
     I'm sorry, could you just give me a moment here?
     (to another worker) Here, let me in here, let me
     in here.

  ANNOTATION
     He types on a keyboard.

  MALCOLM
     All right, now, who's been in here?

  STAFFER
     Just us, sir.

  MALCOLM
     Uh-huh.

  KRAMER
     What is it?

  MALCOLM
     Well, the bridge won't deactivate. I don't
     understand why it wouldn't.

  KRAMER
     Shut down the power to the facility.

  MALCOLM
     Uh, that won't do anything. The system
     self-generates its own power once it's up and
     running.

  KRAMER
     Well, then shut down the containment field. We
     need to get these guests out of here.

  MALCOLM
     That won't work either.

  KRAMER
     Why not?

  MALCOLM
     Why not? Well, that's impossibly complicated,
     but...the containment field's tied to the basic
     operations of the device, all right? It literally
     can't shut down until we collapse the matter
     bridge. It's a safety protocol, one I can't
     reprogram until we power down the device.

  KRAMER
     So we're trapped in here until you can get this
     thing fixed?

  MALCOLM
     (impatiently) Yes!

  KRAMER
     Well, what happens until then?

  MALCOLM
     The bridge will continue to draw heat from the
     heat-sink.

  KRAMER
     We've just dropped ten degrees in ten minutes. In
     an hour, we're going to be below zero; we're going
     to freeze to death.

  MALCOLM
     Well, I have activated the facility's heating
     system. That should buy us a little bit of time.

  KRAMER
     You said "without a hitch." You'd run hundreds of
     tests.

  MALCOLM
     Someone has messed with the system!


LOCATION--RECEPTION AREA

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and McKay stand with Nye at a cocktail
     table.

  NYE
     That was out of line, man.

  MCKAY
     He stole the work!

  NYE
     Hey, come on. It was in the middle of his
     presentation.

  MCKAY
     He was about to start the thing up! It couldn't
     wait.

  NYE
     He brought you here as an olive branch. He wanted
     to bury the hatchet.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, in my back.

  ANNOTATION
     The security man from registration approaches the
     table.

  SECURITY
     Dr. McKay? Dr. Keller?

  MCKAY AND KELLER
     Yes?

  SECURITY
     Mr. Tunney would like a word.

  MCKAY
     Ah-hah. Well, I'm guessing that that word is, "I
     apologize."

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller leave.

  NYE
     (calling after them) That's, uh, two words,
     genius.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes back to reading his brief and shakes his
     head.

  NYE
     That's one odd duck, that guy.


LOCATION--CONFERENCE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and McKay sit waiting in the conference
     room. Kramer and Malcolm enter.

  MCKAY
     (smug) Ah. Well, it takes a big man to admit that
     he's wrong, and much as I appreciate it, I, uh,
     really would prefer that this whole apology thing
     took place a little more publicly.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller rolls her eyes.

  MALCOLM
     (furious) Are you kidding? You are the one that
     should be apologizing to me.

  MCKAY
     (blankly) What the hell for?

  MALCOLM
     I invited you here as a courtesy. Out of kindness.
     You know, most people think you've lost your mind.
     That you've gone, uh, Howard Hughes.

  MCKAY
     Just because I don't call anymore doesn't mean I'm
     keeping my urine in jars. Look, I don't need you
     to--

  KRAMER
     (interrupting) Shut up, I don't have time for
     this. What have you two done?

  KELLER
     What have we done?!

  MALCOLM
     We can't shut the device down.

  MCKAY
     I told you not to turn it on. I practically begged
     you, but would you listen? No!

  KRAMER
     Tell us what you did and how to undo it, and I'll
     consider not pressing charges.

  KELLER
     W-we didn't do anything.

  KRAMER
     Oh really? Explain this, then.

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm turns on a display. Security footage of
     Malcolm's office appears onscreen, with McKay and
     Keller entering.

  KELLER
     (on video) We shouldn't be in here.

  MCKAY
     (on video) Stand guard there.

  KELLER
     (on video) Why?

  MCKAY
     (on video) It'll take me a couple of seconds to
     hack into his computer.

  KELLER
     (on video) What are you doing?!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller squirm uncomfortably as their
     video selves argue on the monitor.

  MCKAY
     (on video) If that son of a bitch thinks that he
     can humiliate me in front of my peers and get away
     with it, he's got another think coming. I will
     destroy him!

  KELLER
     (on video) Now is not the time, Rodney!

  MCKAY
     (on video) There's got to be something in here I
     can use to discredit that pretentious tool.

  ANNOTATION
     Now it is Malcolm that squirms at the footage.

  KELLER
     (on video) Hurry up, hurry up, someone's coming.
     Come on, come on, come on.

  ANNOTATION
     The video footage ends.

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Now, look, I can see, how...out
     of...context...that could seem incriminating.

  MALCOLM
     (incredulous) Out of context?

  KRAMER
     What were you doing in there?

  MCKAY
     I was looking for a paper I published a little
     over two years ago. One that dealt with a matter
     bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     He glares at Malcolm.

  MALCOLM
     Rodney, you have not published a paper in a very
     long time.

  MCKAY
     You probably didn't even know it was my work.

  MALCOLM
     (skeptical) Oh, you're publishing under a nom de
     plume now?

  MCKAY
     Okay...here's how I think it went down. You were
     working with the government. Someone there trusted
     you...a lot and let you see something you weren't
     supposed to see, or maybe you were sent something
     by accident. Who knows? You saw a paper about a
     matter bridge--a project that was shut down due to
     the adverse effects of exotic particles. You read
     it. You realized that if the bridge was used
     merely as a transfer of energy, say, heat, there
     would be no exotic particle creation, and thus no
     adverse effects. So you co-opted the science as
     your own, made a few changes to make yourself feel
     better, and got to work, dismissing the original
     author's warnings about the inherent instability
     of time-space bridges. How am I doing so far?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay glares at Malcolm who holds a poker face but
     stiffens guiltily.

  KRAMER
     That's preposterous. Dr. Tunney's been working on
     this for years.

  MCKAY
     (ignoring Kramer) That was my work, Malcolm. I
     wrote that paper.

  MALCOLM
     (with difficulty) Terrence, these people may be
     able to help us.


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and McKay are with Kramer and Malcolm in
     the lab. McKay looks at the computers.

  MCKAY
     This is bad.

  KRAMER
     The sabotage?

  MCKAY
     (scoffing) Sabotage? Please.

  KRAMER
     (to Malcolm) Look, you said there was...

  MALCOLM
     (talking over him) I may have rushed to judgment.

  KRAMER
     Can you shut it down?

  MCKAY
     These matter bridges are the very definition of
     unpredictable.

  KELLER
     You know, I-I think I remember you saying
     something about that before.

  KRAMER
     Yes or no, Doctor?

  MCKAY
     I don't know yet. Have you turned up the heat?

  MALCOLM
     (irritated) Yes.

  MCKAY
     Have you noticed this?

  ANNOTATION
     He points to a display.

  MALCOLM
     (irritated) Yes!

  KELLER
     What is it?

  MCKAY
     The bridge isn't drawing a consistent load from
     the heat-sink. Instead, it's...wavering.

  KELLER
     Why is that bad?

  MALCOLM
     I wouldn't necessarily call it bad...it-it's
     definitely not good, but I don't know that I'd go
     so far as to call it bad.

  KELLER
     You're kidding me, right?

  MCKAY
     A regular bridge should draw the same out of
     energy from the heat-sink at all times. This one
     is fluctuating greatly... (inspired) Maybe we can
     use that. Wait for it to peak, then overload it
     and crash.

  MALCOLM
     That's a good idea.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I thought you'd like it, what with it being
     my idea and all.

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm shoots McKay a look.

     Nye is with Stephen Hawking. Everyone is shifting
     and shivering.

  NYE
     It's freezing in here.

  HAWKING
     We get it. It works. Shut it down. I'm starting to
     freeze in my chair.

  ANNOTATION
     A blue energy bolt passes between them, barely
     missing Nye but striking another guest, freezing
     him solidly in place as his glass drops to the
     floor. The man is now half covered in frost and
     stiff as a statue.

  NYE
     What the hell was that?


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS FACILITY, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Nye and Keller study the man, who is now lying on
     the floor, still frozen solid. McKay and Malcolm
     stand nearby.

  MCKAY
     A sudden and dramatic cooling beam. (realizing)
     The irregular power pull from the bridge.

  MALCOLM
     Oh, so when the bridge makes a sudden demand on
     the heat-sink...

  MCKAY
     The heat-sink reacts by drawing power from a
     single localized place inside the containment
     field.

  MALCOLM
     And that beam would freeze anything in its path.
     Oh...I did not see this coming.

  MCKAY
     It's...freeze-lightning.

  MALCOLM
     Freeze lightning? Ooh, I like that.

  MCKAY
     (defensively) Well, you can't have it. It's mine.
     It's...copywritten.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller walks over.

  MCKAY
     (concerned) How's he doing?

  KELLER
     He's in very bad shape. It's like his whole left
     side has...been flash-frozen. I have never seen
     anything like this before.

  MALCOLM
     (shaking his head) Oh. Oh, man.

  MCKAY
     (comforting) Look, this isn't entirely your fault.

  MALCOLM
     I--I really hope he signed his waiver.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Keller exchange appalled looks.

  KELLER
     Er, do you think this is the first time this has
     happened?

  MALCOLM
     Yeah, or maybe just the first time anyone's been
     around to notice it.

  MCKAY
     So this thing could be wreaking havoc all over the
     facility.

  KELLER
     So...this is going to keep happening?

  MALCOLM
     Yes, and probably with greater frequency.

  MCKAY
     Okay, this little side effect is going to really
     hamper our attempts to shut this thing down.

  KELLER
     And by "hamper", you mean get us all killed.

  MCKAY
     (regretfully) Yeah. Something like that.


LOCATION--KRAMER INNOVATIONS LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Keller, McKay, Malcolm, and Kramer all stand
     together in the lab.

  MCKAY
     We need to call in the military.

  KRAMER
     I'd prefer not to do that just yet.

  KELLER
     You're lucky that guy out there isn't dead!

  KRAMER
     I'm sure these two can get the device back into
     its proper operating mode.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakes her head incredulously.

  MCKAY
     (scornfully) Well, it's a little late for that.

  MALCOLM
     T-Terrence, things have gotten out of hand. We
     need to make that call.

  KRAMER
     We make that call, and the government shuts us
     down.

  MCKAY
     Yeah. That's the idea.

  MALCOLM
     I don't understand. When the device started to
     malfunction, the first thing you wanted to do was
     get everyone out of here safely.

  KRAMER
     To avoid the project being branded as too
     dangerous to move forward.

  KELLER
     Well, the cat's out of the bag now.

  MCKAY
     What, are you worried about all the money you sunk
     into this? 'Cause that's gone!

  KRAMER
     No, I'm not worried about the money! We're close
     to coming up to a solution for global warming! We
     could save the planet! It's bigger than me, and
     it's bigger than you. And if we can get the device
     under control without calling the military,
     they're going to let us continue our research.

  MCKAY
     I've got news for you. You can't control it, and
     you shouldn't continue with your research!

  KRAMER
     We'll figure it out. I have the utmost faith in
     both of you.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  MCKAY
     (stammering) This is ridiculous. Give me your
     cell.

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures to Malcolm.

  MALCOLM
     Eh, it won't work. Not with the containment field
     up. There's too much interference.

     McKay takes the phone from Malcolm and listens for
     himself as Malcolm rolls his eyes.

  MCKAY
     It's dead.

  MALCOLM
     Mm-hmm.

  KELLER
     Kramer must've killed the phones.

  MCKAY
     I don't suppose you have access to the

  MALCOLM
     It's a Kramer facility. I just work here.

  MCKAY
     (sarcastic) Oh, great.

  MALCOLM
     Looks like it's up to you and me.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, we better get back to the control room.
     Figure this out ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     The two head for the door.

  KELLER
     Wait! W-w-wait, wait. Isn't there like a room full
     of geniuses out there?

  MALCOLM AND MCKAY
     (both snickering) That's debatable.

  ANNOTATION
     They exchange awkward looks at their stereo
     response.

  KELLER
     If that freeze lightning thing happens again,
     people could die.

  MCKAY

  KELLER
     (scolding) Hey! What happened to that humble thing
     we were going to try today?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks chastened. Malcolm looks from Keller
     to McKay in bemusement.


LOCATION--RECEPTION AREA

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm, McKay, and Keller stand on the stairwell.
     Malcolm speaks to all the guests who stand in rapt
     attention.

  MALCOLM
     ...The result is what I am calling "freeze
     lightning."

  MCKAY
     (muttering under his breath) Unbelievable.

  MALCOLM
     It is the sudden and immediate transfer of heat
     from a localized area, and it is potentially very
     lethal.

  MCKAY
     Look, we need to figure out how to collapse the
     matter bridge, stop it from drawing energy from
     the heat-sink, otherwise it's going to get
     "unlivably" cold in here.

  FEMALE SCIENTIST
     Why don't we just turn this containment field off
     and get out of here?

  ANNOTATION
     Others murmur their agreement.

  MALCOLM
     Well, for one thing, it's tied into the basic
     function of the matter bridge, so we can't just
     shut it off.

  MCKAY
     And even if we could, it houses so much cool air
     now that it would create a...sudden massive cold
     front as soon as it drops. I mean, we're talking
     high-speed winds, tornados, an..instant
     mega-storm.

  ANNOTATION
     Several scientists murmur and shift worriedly.

  MALCOLM
     Not to mention the fact that the heat-sink draw
     heat not just from this facility, but from the
     entire planet. We cannot allow that to happen.

  NYE
     Why don't we just destroy it? Just bash it apart?

  MCKAY
     (slowly) Because that could create a tear in our
     space-time?

  NYE
     Never mind then.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     A blast of freeze lightning goes through the room,
     striking the wall over the heads of several
     guests.

  KELLER
     Look. You guys are the best of the best. I'm sure
     if you work together, you'll...come up with
     something.

  ANNOTATION
     As time has passed, the attendees are all grouped
     around various white boards, marking them with
     formulas and equations. Several are in heated
     battles with each other.

  FEMALE
     That will never work.! Look, just give me two
     seconds to...

  SCIENTIST TWO
     No, no.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works with Bill Nye and Malcolm Tunney.

  NYE
     ...all wrong!

  MCKAY
     Watch who you're correcting, "Science Guy". My PhD
     is not honorary.

  NYE
     Hey, look, I'm an engineer. I can do math.
     Just-just-just listen to my idea.

  MCKAY
     I have been listening to you, and that is what led
     me to believe that you are a moron!

  ANNOTATION
     Nye blinks and rears back in angry shock.

  MALCOLM
     If it's any consolation, you're both wrong.

  MCKAY
     (scoffing) And you're right?

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm nods.

  NYE
     (scoffing) We're supposed to listen to you? you're
     the jerk that got us into this mess!

  MCKAY
     I have a workable theory!

  MALCOLM
     Yeah, a "theory".

  MCKAY
     Maybe take into account the fact that I have some
     experience with this, that I have been doing work
     that is years ahead of anything you guys have even
     been dreaming of?

  MALCOLM
     (talking over McKay) Well, you still haven't got
     that out of your system...

  NYE
     (talking over McKay) ....we should be taking a
     time machine, maybe so that we can...

  MCKAY
     (talking over Malcolm and Nye) I think that's
     kinda what I'm getting at.

  KELLER
     (shouting over everyone) Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     She smacks her hands together loudly. Everyone in
     the hall stops arguing and turns to her.

  KELLER
     (admonishing) This is embarrassing! Look at you!
     The greatest minds this world has to offer, and if
     I didn't know any better, I'd think there were a
     bunch of sixth graders in here. You guys need to
     suck it up and get along.

  NYE
     It's like I've always said. You see, people are
     more alike than they are different--

  KELLER
     Not now, Nye!

  NYE
     (contrite) Okay.

     Our lives are at stake here. We need a solution,
     and we need this fast. Please...come on, the rest
     of us are counting on you.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tentatively raises his hand.

  KELLER
     Yes, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     I think I'm onto something. I...it just needs some
     ironing out.

  KELLER
     Okay. Great. Guys...

  ANNOTATION
     She gestures for others to join McKay.

  NYE
     (guiltily) Yes.

  MALCOLM
     (guiltily) Yeah, well, let's have a look at it....

  NYE
     Fresh eyes.

  MCKAY
     We'll start-we'll start with Bill's theory...

  ANNOTATION
     More scientists gather around. Keller notices
     Kramer still standing beside her, looking sadly
     out into the crowd. She walks over to him.

  KRAMER
     They'll figure something out.

  KELLER
     I'm sure they will. Let's just hope it's before
     someone dies.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at her.

  KELLER
     You know, my Uncle George, he always hated the
     phrase "save the planet."

  KRAMER
     (nonplussed) What?

  KELLER
     Well, he just thought it was a little backwards,
     you know? 'Cause the planet's going to be here no
     matter what happens. It might be a giant,
     unlivable rock, but...it's going to survive.

  KRAMER
     (incredulous) So you're turning this into a
     discussion on semantics?

  KELLER
     What I mean is, Mr. Kramer, the work you're
     doing...isn't about saving the planet. It's about
     saving lives. And that's a noble pursuit, trying
     to save billions of people...but it's no less
     noble to save a hundred. These guys, no matter how
     smart they are, they could use some help. One
     phone call could get that help here. Now
     please...please let me make that call.

  ANNOTATION
     He nods. Keller smiles and swallows in relief.

  KRAMER
     Oh, I'm so sorry.

  KELLER

  ANNOTATION
     Keller sighs and rubs her arms to keep warm.

     A thermometer display shows the room is at 36

     Malcolm hovers over a workstation. McKay rushes in
     and hands his jacket to Keller, helping her put it
     on. Other scientists are also scattered through
     the room.

  MCKAY
     (irritated) Well, that's terrible news.

  KRAMER
     It's my fault. I should've--

  MCKAY
     (cutting him off snidely) Yes. You should've.

  MALCOLM
     You need to see this.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay comes over to Malcolm.

  MCKAY
     Aw, the cold temperatures are affecting the
     containment field emitters. I mean, they're weak,
     they're on the verge of failing.

  KELLER
     That's great! We can get most of the people out of
     here, no? Make a call to the military?

  MCKAY
     We're surrounded by desert air. I mean, the
     temperatures inside the containment field have
     gotten very, very cold. Introducing a sudden and
     immediate blast of icy air is going to create
     one...helluva vortex storm.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks to Malcolm, who nods his agreement.

  MCKAY
     There's no way a cell transmission's gonna make it
     through, let alone actually get people out of here
     safely.

  KRAMER
     We can ride out the storm.

  MALCOLM
     No. If we can't shut down the device, the
     heat-sink's going to keep feeding cold air into
     that weather system. It'll-it'll never stop.

  KELLER
     That's not good.

  MALCOLM
     No. I'd...rather that didn't happen.

  MCKAY
     (inspired) No, no, no, no. This might be a good
     thing.

  KELLER
     What is it?

  MCKAY
     Well, the containment field is dying a slow but
     consistent death. It might be weak enough to
     actually punch a cell phone signal through now.

  MALCOLM
     (excitedly) Oh, you know, you might be right.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls out a tablet computer and pulls up a
     schematic of the facility.

  MALCOLM
     Okay, this is probably our best bet. These two
     emitters are the weakest. Aw, it's a bit of a run
     from here, so I'd better get going right now.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts off. Keller hurries to block his path.

  KELLER
     Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Give me your cell.

  MALCOLM
     Huh?

  KELLER
     We need you here to help Rodney dismantle the
     bridge. I-I'll make the call.

  MALCOLM
     (bemused)

  KELLER
     I'm going to radio once I get through.

  MCKAY
     (worried) Good luck.

  KELLER
     You too.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks at him, then hurries out.

  MALCOLM
     She seems like a very capable woman.

  MCKAY
     She sure is.

  MALCOLM
     It's your sister, right? Is she single?

  ANNOTATION
     Malcolm turns back to the other scientists. McKay
     sighs in annoyance.

  MCKAY
     All right, where were we?

  NYE
     Your idea of overwhelming the bridge to the point
     of collapse--it's a good one. It's right on track.

  MCKAY
     But...?

  NYE
     Everybody here thinks it means we've got to dial
     up the heat-sink. It's going to get even colder.

  MALCOLM
     And that could result in an unpredictable amount
     of freeze lightning.

  MCKAY
     Which could kill us all.

  MALCOLM
     Right.

  KRAMER
     The facility's furnace just went down.

  MCKAY
     W-what?! Well, how did that happen?

  KRAMER
     We've been running at 120% for the last hour to
     compensate for falling temperatures. We're in the
     middle of the desert. The facility's not meant to
     be heated like this.

  MCKAY
     (caustic) Well, we're gonna get below freezing
     pretty darn quick now.

  MALCOLM
     All right, well we can't power down, 'cause it
     generates its own power.

  NYE
     And we can't wait for the containment field to
     collapse because the storm will probably kill us
     all.

  MCKAY
     (interrupting) All right, guys, we don't have a
     choice, okay? We gotta wait for the bridge to
     peak, dial up the heat-sink, see if we can
     overwhelm it. I know it's dangerous, but
     that's...all we got.

  MALCOLM
     (shaking his head) Uh...

  ANNOTATION
     He and Nye exchange resigned looks and shrug at
     McKay, agreeing to his plan..

  MCKAY
     (bombastically) Okay, look. There's too many
     people in here. I have important work to do. I do
     not need you in the way. So, everybody, out!

     It's probably better they don't know. I mean, we
     have no way of moving people to a safe area. Plus,

  MCKAY
     Look, this device is capable of generating its own
     power, right?

  MALCOLM
     Yeah, a small percentage of the energy that we're
     transferring is siphoned off to power the device.
     So once it's running, it's self-sustaining.

  MCKAY
     Which is why we can't just pull the plug.

  MALCOLM
     Exactly.

  MCKAY
     But it's only capable of powering itself to a
     certain extent, right? I mean, it has a finite
     amount of power generation capability?

  MALCOLM
     Well, yes, of course.

  MCKAY
     Maybe we've been approaching this the wrong way.
     We've been trying to force so much power through
     the bridge that it overloads it. I mean, maybe we
     should be trying to...starve it. I mean, suck so
     much power from its generator that it stalls it
     out.

  MALCOLM
     Well, technically we could do that, but you'd have
     to draw an insane amount of power. The heat-sink
     could never do it.

     could.

  MALCOLM

  KELLER
     (exasperated) Rodney, does it really matter?

  MCKAY
     (after a pause) Yes. Yes it does. I'm sorry. I
     know I'm supposed to be humble. I know I'm not
     supposed to care. But I do, I really do. And
     that's...well, that's something you should know
     about me.

  KELLER
     Well, quit, then. Join the private sector. Start
     doing work the whole world can see.

  MCKAY
     Well, I've been thinking about it.

  KELLER
     What? No you haven't.

  MCKAY
     Hey, my contract with SGC is up this year. Maybe
     it's time for me to move on, time for me to...do
     other things.

  KELLER
     (skeptical) Please. I don't anyone who loves their
     job more than you.

  MCKAY
     (knowing bluff has been called) Hmph.

  KELLER
     So you think the military's going to let them keep
     experimenting?

  MCKAY
     I think it's highly unlikely. Besides,
     geoengineering's a dumb pursuit anyway. I mean, no
     one person's going to solve global warming. We all
     have to do our part.

  KELLER
     (deadpan) Like not take private jets.

  MCKAY
     Well, they were going our way anyway.

  ANNOTATION
     They both smile and chuckle.

  KELLER
     (coyly) You know, it's kind of nice just me and
     you back here.

  MCKAY
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller raises her eyebrows with an expectant look.

  MCKAY
     (realizing) Right! Wait, you were legally dead a
     few hours ago. You were practically frozen. You
     really want to...

  KELLER
     Well, it's either that or you keep telling me how
     you and only you saved the day.

  MCKAY
     Nah...

  ANNOTATION
     He changes seats to sit next to her.

  MCKAY
     I'm trying this whole, um, "humble" thing out. It
     seems to be quite a hit with the ladies.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin to kiss, Keller untangling herself from
     her blanket to embrace McKay as the kiss deepens.
