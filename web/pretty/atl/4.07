LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla enters to find Keller packing.

  TEYLA
     Are you ready? They're preparing to dial the
     'gate.

  KELLER
     Yeah, almost finished.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks around at the other large bags already
     packed to the brim. Keller notices.

  KELLER
     I know. I'm terrible at packing. I never know how
     much to bring.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes over to some shelves to find more
     supplies.

  TEYLA
     We're only going overnight. I'm sure you have
     enough.

  KELLER
     Well, you'd think so, but...

  TEYLA
     You seem nervous.

  KELLER
     Oh, no. I'm fine...well, maybe a little. Going
     off-world is still kinda new to me. Whole other
     galaxy and meeting new civilizations.

  TEYLA
     My people are very welcoming, and they're eager to
     meet you.

  KELLER
     Well, I'm eager to meet them too. Learn about
     their culture and their history.

  TEYLA
     A gesture for which they will be most grateful.

  KELLER
     It's just...I know they were very fond of Carson.
     I only hope to make half the impression he did.

  ANNOTATION
     She tries to stuff a large plastic tub into one of
     the bags.

  TEYLA
     What are those?

  KELLER
     Oh. Lollipops. For the kids. It makes the
     check-ups go easier.

  TEYLA
     You will make a wonderful impression.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller smiles shyly and zips up her bag.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and Teyla walk in. Teyla makes last minute
     touch ups to her outfit. Sheppard watches them
     from the balcony above.

  SHEPPARD
     Whoo, look at you! Got a date?

  TEYLA
     (rolling her eyes) Please. You will contact us if
     you need us?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, we'll be fine. You kids have fun. (to Keller)
     You're gonna love the Athosians.

  KELLER
     I'm going to experience my first Tandul feast.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, those are good. But watch out for
     the...um...whaddya call it?

  TEYLA
     Roos wine.

  SHEPPARD
     Roos wine. Tasty stuff, but helluva kick.

  TEYLA
     We really should be going.

  SHEPPARD
     Have fun, kids.

  ANNOTATION
     They go through the wormhole.


LOCATION--STARGATE AREA, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  TEYLA
     The settlement is through the woods.

  KELLER
     Lead the way!

  TEYLA
     It...is some distance. Let me help you with those.

  ANNOTATION
     She reaches for one of Keller's bags.

  KELLER
     Oh, no-no. It's okay. I'm the idiot who
     overpacked. I should be the idiot carrying them.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks at her, then nods.

  KELLER
     (grinning) So Sheppard was right, huh? About that
     hot date tonight?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla smiles but says nothing.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     They reach the outskirts of the settlement. By
     now, Keller only carries the pack on her back.
     Teyla is hefting the two large duffle bags. No one
     else is around.

  KELLER
     (winded) I didn't think it would be this far! Is
     it always this quiet?

  TEYLA
     (worried) Something is wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     She drops Keller's bags and hurries forward. The
     settlement is empty.

  TEYLA
     Hello?! Hello! Is anybody here?

  KELLER
     Where is everyone?

  TEYLA
     I do not know. But they did not leave of their own
     accord.

  KELLER
     Are you saying they were attacked?

  TEYLA
     Or culled.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Keller look for signs of what has
     happened to the people.

  KELLER
     I thought the Wraith didn't know about this
     planet.

  TEYLA
     That was my understanding as well.

  KELLER
     Well then, how could they just--

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla raises her hand for silence.

  KELLER
     (more quietly) What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks around then pulls Keller into some
     brush to hide. A couple of primitively dressed men
     approach the duffle bags Teyla abandoned and start
     searching them.

  KELLER
     You know them?

  TEYLA
     (tightly) We must leave.

  KELLER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla moves while the men are distracted. A
     confused Keller follows.


LOCATION--WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla leads Keller through the woods.

  TEYLA
     Over here.

  ANNOTATION
     She directs them to a large stump where they
     crouch and hide.

  TEYLA
     The weapons cache is too far.

  KELLER
     What?

  TEYLA
     Better to make a run for the 'gate.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts tugging at Keller's pack.

  KELLER
     What are you--what are you looking for?

  TEYLA
     Did you bring a weapon?

  KELLER
     No. That's just medical supplies. Don't you have a
     weapon?!

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla brandishes a large knife.

  TEYLA
     Just a knife. I was coming to visit my people. I
     did not believe I would need a gun.

  KELLER
     Who are those men?

  TELA
     Bola Kai.

  KELLER
     You know them?

  TEYLA
     I know of them. The markings on their faces are
     distinctive to their tribe. But I have never
     crossed paths with them...until now.

  KELLER
     Are they dangerous?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla finishes rummaging through Keller's pack.

  TEYLA
     Beyond dangerous. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller puts her pack back on. Teyla leads Keller
     through the woods again. They head up a steep
     incline. Two-thirds of the way up, Keller slips
     and tumbles down the hill, landing on her pack.

  KELLER
     Ah!

  ANNOTATION
     She reaches for her ankle. Teyla clambers back
     down the incline.

  TEYLA
     Are you all right?

  KELLER
     I twisted my ankle.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nervously looks around.

  TEYLA
     We have to keep moving.

  KELLER
     Just...hang on a second.

  TEYLA
     (urgently) Is it broken?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller examines it some more.

  KELLER
     No, I don't think so. It's probably just sprained.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla helps Keller to her feet.

  TEYLA
     Leave the bag. It's too heavy.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes it from Keller and puts it by a tree,
     covering it with some brush. They head towards the
     Stargate.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at the Stargate, still moving through
     the woods. They hide behind a tree as they see two
     Bola Kai at the DHD.

  KELLER
     Oh God, what do we do?

  TEYLA
     It is too risky to return to the weapons cache.

  KELLER
     What weapons cache?

  TEYLA
     We gave my people guns to protect themselves in
     the event they were raided.

  KELLER
     What...what makes you think that the guns would
     still be there? Wouldn't that be the first thing
     those guys would steal?

  TEYLA
     If the Bola Kai stole them, they would be using
     them. But the weapons cache is too far, especially
     in your condition. And we have no idea how many
     more Bola Kai are out there.

  ANNOTATION
     She unsheathes her knife and offers it to Keller.

  TEYLA
     Our best option is to take out these guards by
     ourselves.

  KELLER
     Take them out?! What are you talking about? How
     are we gonna do that?!

  TEYLA
     (desperately) I don't know yet.

  KELLER
     (nervous) Hey, listen. I am not like you. I don't
     know anything about...fighting.

  ANNOTATION
     She stares at the knife now in her hand. Teyla
     grabs a thick arm-length stick.

  TEYLA
     Just do what I say.

  KELLER
     I want to, believe me, but I...I don't think I
     can.

  TEYLA
     You must think otherwise. What we first need to do
     is create a div--

  ANNOTATION
     Two other Bola Kai arrive at the DHD. One of them
     spots Teyla and Keller. Teyla instantly drags
     Keller away. The Bola Kai give chase. They come to
     the edge of an outcropping, and spot nothing.
     Below the outcropping, the two women hide. Teyla
     has her hand covering Keller's mouth. When she
     hears the Bola Kai move away, she removes her
     hand.

  TEYLA
     They are gone. Are you all right?

  KELLER
     (shocked and fighting tears) I'm sorry.

  TEYLA
     I know this is something for which you are
     unprepared.

  KELLER
     I should be prepared. I know.

  TEYLA
     Unfortunately, I'm afraid things may get worse
     before they get better. Those guards will alert
     the others to our situation. They will hunt us.
     The longer we avoid capture, the better our
     chances. They will continue to guard the 'gate,
     yes, but in time, Atlantis will realize we are
     late, and they will send a rescue team.

  KELLER
     But we're not due back 'till tomorrow.

  TEYLA
     It is therefore critical that we elude capture
     until then. What do you need to help your injury?

  KELLER
     Well, I should probably wrap it, but the Ace
     bandages are in the medical kit.

  TEYLA
     (sighing) The kit is on the way to the weapons
     cache. Hopefully, it'll still be where we--

  ANNOTATION
     She breaks off as they hear a drum beating in the
     distance.

  KELLER
     What is that?

  TEYLA
     (voice flat, disappointed) They are summoning the
     others. Gathering them. The hunt is beginning.


LOCATION--WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     They reach the area where they abandoned Keller's
     pack. Keller leans against a tree and lowers
     herself to sit while Teyla retrieves the pack from
     under the hidden brush.

  KELLER
     Oh, thank God.

  TEYLA
     You must move quickly.

  KELLER
     I will.

  ANNOTATION
     She first grabs a medicine bottle and opens it.
     Teyla glances over as she keeps watch.

  KELLER
     Ibuprofen. It helps with the pain and swelling.

  TEYLA
     Yes. Doctor McKay uses them frequently. Along with
     antihistamines, antacids, motion-sickness pills...

  KELLER
     You forgot the prescription I just wrote him for
     "restless-leg syndrome." I've always been a wimp.
     I've a low threshold for pain.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller winces as she removes her shoe and sock and
     starts to wrap the bandage.

  TEYLA
     People often underestimate the level of discomfort
     they are capable of enduring. When I was a child,
     several of us were sent into the woods for ten
     days alone.

  KELLER
     Ten days, alone?

  TEYLA
     It is a rite of passage among my people. No food,
     no water. Forced to survive on our own. None of us
     believed we could endure it, but all of us did.

  KELLER
     I went to summer camp. There were other kids. We
     had cabins. With beds. And electricity. And food.

  TEYLA
     I...see.

  KELLER
     I didn't even make it three days. Got homesick.
     Called my parents to come and get me.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods, steps away and rolls her eyes.


LOCATION--WOODS, WEAPONS CACHE, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The pair continue to move through the woods. Teyla
     carries the medical pack on her back and still
     holds the stick she recovered. Keller limps along
     behind. They reach the cache to find it already
     searched and empty.

  KELLER
     The weapons cache?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods.

  KELLER
     Well, where are the weapons? I mean, obviously the
     Bola Kai don't have them.

  TEYLA
     My people must have needed them to fight off the
     attack. But then why were they not successful? The
     Bola Kai's weapons would have been no match
     against these.


LOCATION--NEAR RIVER, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Keller reach the ridge above a river.
     Teyla nods to a blind.

  TEYLA
     Over there.

  KELLER
     What?

  TEYLA
     There is a blind across the river.

  KELLER
     A blind?

  TEYLA
     For hunting. It is well hidden. It will provide
     shelter for the night.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at a rope bridge across the river. It
     is literally a rope, with other ropes tied as
     handrails.

  KELLER
     (worried) We're gonna...cross that?

  TEYLA
     It is the quickest way across.

  KELLER
     Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

  TEYLA
     My people built it. It is quite safe.

  KELLER
     Oh, I'm...I'm sure it is. It's just...well, my
     ankle. And...I've also got this...inner-ear thing?
     We call it vertigo. And...oh God, look at it!

  TEYLA
     (biting back impatience) There comes a point in
     adversity when fear disappears, leaving only the
     will to survive.

  KELLER
     I know. It's just, I don't think I'm
     even...remotely close to that point yet.

  TEYLA
     Fine. Stay here then.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla starts across the bridge.

  KELLER
     Oh, well, well wait! I mean, I-I'm sure I could-I
     could climb down and find a shallow spot in the
     river to cross. I mean, it might take me a little
     longer, but-- Teyla?

  ANNOTATION
     She looks out to find Teyla already half-way
     across the bridge. She looks around desperately

  KELLER
     Teyla!

  ANNOTATION
     She hesitantly starts across the bridge, talking
     to herself.

  KELLER
     Oh God. Oh...Here we go. Whoo. It's perfectly
     safe... Perfectly safe.... Wobbly--too wobbly...
     Almost there.

  ANNOTATION
     As she makes her way across, her footing slips and
     she falls. Grabbing onto the rope with her hands,
     she dangles over the river. As she loses her grip,
     Teyla is there and pulls her back onto the bridge.
     They make it across together.

  KELLER
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods.

  TEYLA
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     They head through the woods, making their way to
     the blind.

  KELLER
     Maybe your people managed to make it to the 'gate
     and escape.

  TEYLA
     All of them?

  KELLER
     Well, I don't know, maybe. I mean, we haven't
     found any bodies, right? From what you've said, I
     doubt the Bola Kai would take the time to bury
     their victims.

  TEYLA
     No, they do not. Because when they are done with
     their victims, usually very little remains.

  KELLER
     What are you telling me, they're cannibals?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla turns slowly around.

  KELLER
     Teyla?

  ANNOTATION
     A jagged edged disk strikes the tree in front of
     Keller. She gasps. There is a Bola Kai on the
     ridge above them. He throws another as Teyla
     knocks Keller down. She takes back her knife and
     grabs her stick, facing three Bola Kai who circle
     her. Keller scrambles at her pack and comes up
     with a scalpel. She watches as Teyla takes down
     two of the Bola Kai in hand-to-hand combat. The
     third runs away.

  TEYLA
     Are you all right?

  KELLER
     Yeah.

  TEYLA
     Stay here.

  ANNOTATION
     She runs after the escaping Bola Kai.

  KELLER
     What? Teyla? Teyla!

  ANNOTATION
     The Bola Kai runs from Teyla, but she cuts him off
     and strangles him with her stick.

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, Keller cautiously approaches the two
     downed Bola Kai. One of them begins to move.
     Keller grabs his short sword and backs up as he
     groggily gets to his feet. Teyla returns.

  KELLER
     (to Teyla, gesturing to the warriors) That one's
     dead, but...he's still alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla takes the sword from Keller and kills the
     Bola Kai. Keller looks away.

  TEYLA
     We cannot afford to take prisoners.

  KELLER
     Well, we could...we could've tied him up and left
     him in the woods.

  TEYLA
     Then the others would have found him and released
     him to rejoin the hunt. I know it is difficult to
     accept, but the fewer of them, the better our
     chances of survival.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakily nods. They both hear a man moaning
     nearby. They head towards the noise. There is a
     semi-conscious man lying wounded among some rocks.
     Keller heads to him, while Teyla looks around the
     area warily.

  KELLER
     His hands are tied. He must've been a...a
     prisoner. He's got a stab wound to his abdomen.
     Will you get me my medical kit?

  TEYLA
     We have to leave him.

  KELLER
     What are you talking about? He's one of your
     people!

  TEYLA
     He is not Athosian.

  KELLER
     But his...his clothes.

  TEYLA
     I have never seen him before.

  KELLER
     Well, he's obviously not one of them, and if I
     don't suture his wound, he's gonna bleed to death.

  TEYLA
     More Bola Kai will be here very soon.

  KELLER
     I know. But this won't take long, okay? Please?

  ANNOTATION
     The man wheezes and gasps in pain. Teyla studies
     him, then goes for the kit.


LOCATION--WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DUSK

  ANNOTATION
     Keller has finished suturing the wound. She gets
     up and approaches Teyla.

  KELLER
     Well, I got the bleeding under control. If the
     wound doesn't get infected, he should be okay.

  TEYLA
     It will be dark soon. Stay here with him. I will
     find the blind.

  KELLER
     Uh, is-is it far?

  TEYLA
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves Keller and the wounded man and scouts
     ahead. She finds the blind and removes a branch to
     be sure it's save. She finds a wooden chest full
     of hunting traps as well.

  ANNOTATION
     By the time she gets back to the others, it is
     completely dark. The nervous Keller is relieved to
     see her.

  KELLER
     Did you find it?

  TEYLA
     Yes. How is he?

  KELLER
     Unconscious, but stable.

  TEYLA
     Can he be moved?

  KELLER
     Oh, I don't know. He shouldn't be. His condition's
     precarious, I would hate to... (noticing Teyla's
     expression) Yes, he can be moved.


LOCATION--HUNTING BLIND, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and the man are settled in the blind. Teyla
     arrives with a canteen.

  TEYLA
     Water from the river.

  KELLER
     Thank you.

  TEYLA
     I have laid traps around the perimeter. If any
     Bola Kai come near, hopefully we will hear them
     before they discover us.

  KELLER
     Good.

  TEYLA
     How's your ankle?

  KELLER
     The swelling's not too bad, and the pain's eased
     up, thanks to the painkillers.

  TEYLA
     If you wish to sleep, I can...

  ANNOTATION
     There is a scuttling noise outside.

  KELLER
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla silently points to where the ground is
     moving nearby. She moves forward with a spear.
     When the moving ground gets close enough, she
     spears a squid-like creature through the dirt.

  KELLER
     (agape) What is that?

  TEYLA
     Dinner. They are attracted to the warmth of our
     bodies.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes her knife, cuts into the creature, and
     pulls out some meat. She offers it to Keller.

  TEYLA
     The taste leaves much to be desired, but it will
     sustain you.

  KELLER
     (disgusted) Oh, uh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.

  TEYLA
     You should eat.

  KELLER
     Uhn, this was my least favorite part of Survivor.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla eats it instead. Inside, the man starts to
     stir.

  KELLER
     He's regaining consciousness.

  ANNOTATION
     They both move over to him.

  KELLER
     It's okay. You're safe now.

  TEYLA
     Who are you?

  NABEL
     Nabel Golan...of the Genii.

  TEYLA
     The Genii? What are you doing here?

  NABEL
     I was planted to work inside the Athosian
     community. Gather intel.

  TEYLA
     What happened to them?

  NABEL
     Dead. All of them.

  TEYLA
     Who killed my people?

  NABEL
     Wraith. A culling. Entire settlement.

  KELLER
     Not the Bola Kai?

  NABEL
     (shaking his head) Bola Kai were the ones who told
     the Wraith about them.

  TEYLA
     The Bola Kai are Wraith worshippers?

  NABEL
     I was able to escape during the attack, but I was
     cut off from the 'gate. Bola Kai were guarding it.
     They captured me.

  TEYLA
     I have never seen you before. How long have you
     lived among my people?

  NABEL
     I only arrived a few days ago. (he turns and spots
     one of Keller's scanners) Where are you from?

  TEYLA
     She is a friend of mine from another world.

  NABEL
     Your equipment--it looks Ancestral.

  TEYLA
     We discovered it in our travels. We have been away
     for some time, trading.

  NABEL
     Trading? With who?

  TEYLA
     (dangerous tone) If you are still seeking intel,
     then you are wasting what few breaths you have
     remaining. So say: "thank you for saving me", and
     be done with this discussion.

  NABEL
     (swallowing) Thank you...for saving me.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla storms off.


LOCATION--WOODS NEAR BLIND, NEW ATHOS, DAY


LOCATION--HUNTING BLIND

  ANNOTATION
     Nabel sleeps. Keller and Teyla sit.

  TEYLA
     You have not slept all night.

  KELLER
     With people trying to kill us, and...creatures
     crawling around under the ground? Not to mention
     I'm starving.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla reaches over and offers some meat.

  KELLER
     Not that starving.

  TEYLA
     It will give you strength.

  KELLER
     It'll make me puke.

  TEYLA
     You do not believe you are capable of eating it,
     and so you do not.

  KELLER
     No, I think it's disgusting, and so I do not.

  TEYLA
     I have a friend like you, afraid to challenge
     himself.

  KELLER
     I'm not afraid of challenges! I signed up to be
     chief of medicine on an expedition in a whole
     other galaxy. That's about as challenging as it
     gets. But eating gross food? Sorry, but that's
     where I draw the line.

  TEYLA
     Fair enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller moves restlessly, then wincing, she reaches
     for the meat. Closing her eyes, she eats it.

  TEYLA
     (smiling) See? No puking.

  KELLER
     Yet. So this "friend" of yours...one of your team
     members? A certain uptight astrophysicist, maybe?

  TEYLA
     No. Athosian. His name is Kanan. A natural leader,
     but he is unaware of it. Burdened by an overly
     cautious nature.

  KELLER
     He's more than a friend, isn't he? He's the one
     you were coming to see. The hot date. Sorry. It's
     none of my business. I should just learn to shut
     up.

  TEYLA
     We have known each other since childhood, but only
     recently kindled more than a friendship. I have
     not told anyone yet.

  KELLER
     I'm so sorry.

  TEYLA
     (sniffling with tears) We need more water.


LOCATION--WOODS OUTSIDE BLIND, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A Bola Kai, sporting a lollipop, moves cautiously
     through the woods. He sees Teyla leave the blind.
     He moves to get a good shot, and his foot is
     snared in a trap. He screams in agony. Teyla hears
     him and goes back inside.

  TEYLA
     We have to leave.

  ANNOTATION
     They gather their gear and wake Nabel.

  NABEL
     What happened?

  TEYLA
     Can you walk?

  ANNOTATION
     He groans as he tries to sit up.

  KELLER
     I don't even think he can stand.

  TEYLA
     Very soon, many more Bola Kai will be here.

  NABEL
     It's all right. I can walk.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard walk down a corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     Mister Freeze. No, King Tut!

  MCKAY
     Wrong on both. Otto Preminger was Mister Freeze.
     Victor Buono was King Tut. Vincent Price was
     Egghead.

  SHEPPARD
     Egghead! Right.

  MCKAY
     Okay, so...Cliff Robertson?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, I know this one. Played the cowboy, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon meets up with them from another corridor.

  RONON
     Hey! Teyla and Keller get back?

  SHEPPARD
     Haven't heard from them yet.

  RONON
     They're late.

  SHEPPARD
     That doesn't sound like Teyla.

  RONON
     No, it doesn't.

  MCKAY
     Well, she had that big, uh, feast last night.
     Maybe she did too much celebrating and needs to
     sleep it off.

  RONON
     (dryly) Yeah, that sounds like Teyla.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's give her a call. Shame!

  RONON
     What is?

  SHEPPARD
     Cliff Robertson. The villain he played, Shame.

  MCKAY
     Very good. Shelley Winters.

  RONON
     What the hell are you talking about?


LOCATION--WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Keller support Nabel as they hurry down
     the path.

  NABEL
     I need to rest.

  ANNOTATION
     They let him collapse by the path. Teyla motions
     for Keller to come over to her.

  TEYLA
     (sotto voce) He is slowing us down, and he is
     making your ankle injury worse.

  KELLER
     (low) Well, if we leave him behind, the Bola Kai
     are gonna capture him!

  TEYLA
     (low) If we continue this way, we will all be
     captured!

  KELLER
     Look, I'm the first to admit, I'm not very good at
     certain things. I'm not athletic, I can't cook,
     you don't even want to hear me try to play the
     piano. But I do think I'm a pretty good judge of
     character, and I know that you would never
     sacrifice an innocent man, not even if he was a
     complete stranger, to save yourself. Which means
     the only reason you would even suggest it would be
     because of me.

  TEYLA
     I brought you here. This is my responsibility. If
     anything should happen to you--

  KELLER
     I signed up for this, all right? All of it. I may
     not have had any idea what I was getting into, but
     that makes me no different from anybody else on
     Atlantis.

  TEYLA
     (distracted) I'm glad you feel that way...

  KELLER
     (rolling her eyes) Oh yeah, I know, I know. Before
     this is all over, I'm gonna have to find all the
     courage I can muster.

  ANNOTATION
     Several Bola Kai approach, surrounding them.

  TEYLA
     Actually, you're going to need to find it right
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla prepares to fight with a stick.

  KELLER
     Oh god.

  ANNOTATION
     Nabel lies unnoticed by the incline. He watches
     warily. The Bola Kai attack, Teyla knocking down
     several of them after several blows. Nabel escapes
     during the confusion. Teyla gets knocked down.
     Keller gets dragged away by two warriors.

  KELLER
     Teyla!

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla rallies but is soon overpowered and knocked
     unconscious.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is active. Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay
     look worried.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Teyla, this is Atlantis, do you read?
     Teyla, this is Sheppard. Come in.

  MCKAY
     She wouldn't turn off her radio.

  RONON
     No, she wouldn't.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Calling anyone in the Athosian
     settlement, this is Lieutenant Colonel John
     Sheppard, do you copy?


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A radio lies unnoticed amongst the debris. Bola
     Kai wander everywhere.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Teyla, this is Sheppard. Please
     respond...

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Keller are in a wooden cage, their hands
     tied to the slats above them.

  KELLER
     What are they gonna do to us?

  TEYLA
     They will try to extricate information. We must
     tell them nothing. Doctor Keller, the lives of
     everyone in Atlantis are at stake.

  KELLER
     I know. I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to cry.

  TEYLA
     Where are you from?

  KELLER
     What?

  TEYLA
     Your home.

  KELLER
     Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. A little town.

  TEYLA
     Do you have any family?

  KELLER
     Just my dad. My mom died a few years back.

  TEYLA
     I'm sorry. You must miss him.

  KELLER
     I'm all he's got left.

  TEYLA
     Then you must do everything you can to survive, to
     return home. You must--

  ANNOTATION
     Two Bola Kai approach the cage.

  TEYLA
     (fiercely) You will survive! You will return home!
     Do you understand?

  ANNOTATION
     They are pulled out and taken to one of the larger
     tents.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN TENT

  ANNOTATION
     They are forced to kneel. The Bola Kai leader
     studies the Lantian scanner.

  LEADER
     Who are you?

  TEYLA
     I am Athosian.

  LEADER
     I don't believe you.

  TEYLA
     I do not care what you believe.

  ANNOTATION
     He backhands Teyla.

  LEADER
     The longer you are silent, the worse it will be
     for you.

  TEYLA
     I told you, we are Athosian. And you will suffer
     for what you have done to our people.

  LEADER
     (nonplussed) What we've done?

  TEYLA
     You murdered them, an entire village!

  LEADER
     That village was deserted when we arrived.

  TEYLA
     Deserted because it was culled by the Wraith.
     Wraith who were brought here by you!

  LEADER
     Do you know who we are?!

  TEYLA
     You are Bola Kai.

  LEADER
     Then you know we are hunted by the Wraith like
     everyone else.

  TEYLA
     Unless you are Wraith worshippers!

  ANNOTATION
     He hisses in outrage and strikes Teyla, knocking
     her unconscious.

  LEADER
     (to guards) Get her out of here!

  ANNOTATION
     They drag her away.

  LEADER
     (to Keller) I'm willing to spare her life, if you
     tell me who you are.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller looks terrified.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The guards lead Keller back to the cage. Teyla is
     already there. The warriors leave. The women still
     have their hands tied in front of them.

  TEYLA
     Did you tell them anything?

  KELLER
     They said they would kill you.

  TEYLA
     (whispering) You told them about Atlantis?

  KELLER
     No! I...I gave them a 'gate address to an
     uninhabited planet, just to throw them off. Buy us
     more time, like you said.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods.

  KELLER
     I don't think they're Wraith worshippers. That guy
     in there, he seemed genuinely surprised when you
     accused him of working with the Wraith. Why would
     he deny it if it was true? I would think that
     would provide an even more effective threat to get
     us to talk.

  TEYLA
     So they just happened to arrive here moments after
     the settlement was culled? I find that a
     coincidence.

  ANNOTATION
     They are distracted by a warrior running through
     the camp to the leader.

  BOLA KAI SCOUT
     Something just came through the portal. A flying
     ship of some kind, but it disappeared before we
     could do anything.

  LEADER
     You two, watch them. The rest of you, get your
     weapons and come with me.

  ANNOTATION
     The Bola Kai rush out of the settlement.

  TEYLA
     (to Keller) Not much longer.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon are inside.

  SHEPPARD
     Those guys guarding the 'gate certainly didn't
     look Athosian.

  RONON
     They're Bola Kai.

  MCKAY
     What?

  RONON
     It's a warrior tribe, ruthless. They like picking
     fights, especially with tribes who are peaceful.

  MCKAY
     Great. Just what we need, another bad guy.

  RONON
     Don't worry, they're primitive. We can handle
     them.

  MCKAY
     Define primitive.

  RONON
     Clubs and arrows.

  MCKAY
     Hey, arrows can hurt!

  RONON
     Only if you're stupid enough to get hit in the ass
     with one.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard smirks.

  SHEPPARD
     Life signs?

  MCKAY
     All over the place, and mostly in the woods. It's
     hard to get a visual from up here.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, we'll have to go on foot then. Gear up,
     boys. If these guys want a fight, happy to give it
     to them.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     One of the guards hovers over the cage then kicks
     it, intimidating the two prisoners. Suddenly he is
     shot by a bullet and falls. The other guard is
     soon hit as well.

  TEYLA
     John?!

  ANNOTATION
     Nabel appears. He carries a pistol.

  KELLER
     Nabel.

  ANNOTATION
     Nabel reaches the cage.

  NABEL
     Move back.

  ANNOTATION
     They do, and he shoots the lock.

  TEYLA
     (cautiously) Where did you get the gun?

  NABEL
     The Athosians were not the only ones with a hidden
     cache of weapons. The Bola Kai captured me before
     I could get to mine.

  TEYLA
     We need to get moving. They no doubt heard the
     gunfire.

  ANNOTATION
     They run out of the settlement.


LOCATION--WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla, Keller, and Nabel stop in the woods. Keller
     is free, but Teyla's hands are still tied.

  KELLER
     They coming?

  TEYLA
     It does not appear so. I believe it is safe to
     rest. (to Nabel) Thank you for coming for us.

  NABEL
     Well, you saved my life. I figured I'd return the
     favor.

  KELLER
     I thought you were dead.

  NABEL
     Well, I can't die yet. I have far too many
     questions I need answers to first.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes Teyla by surprise by hitting her in the
     face with his pistol, knocking her to the ground,
     He turns his gun to Keller.

  NABEL
     We can start with you giving me the 'gate address
     to Atlantis.


LOCATION--CLEARING, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Ronon, and Sheppard appear out of nowhere
     as they exit the cloaked jumper. McKay studies his
     scanner.

  MCKAY
     I got lifesigns, there, there, there, and there.

  ANNOTATION
     He points in all four directions.

  SHEPPARD
     That really narrows it down.

  RONON
     That way.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts heading in one direction.

  MCKAY
     Really? Why?

  RONON
     No reason.

  SHEPPARD
     Good enough for me. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay follow Ronon.


LOCATION--FOREST, NEW ATHOS, DAY

  KELLER
     Why are you doing this?

  NABEL
     Just give me the address, and I'll let you go. I
     promise.

  KELLER
     I see you're not as badly wounded as I thought.

  NABEL
     Oh, it's bad. I just have a high tolerance for
     pain. The address, and I'll let you go. Both of
     you.

  KELLER
     You're lying. You're not Genii, are you? We have
     an understanding with them. They wouldn't need to
     resort to these tactics in order to contact us.

  NABEL
     (shrugging) All right, so that part wasn't true.
     But I was captured by the Bola Kai.

  KELLER
     You're the Wraith worshipper. You're the one
     responsible for the death of the Athosians.

  ANNOTATION
     He lowers his gun.

  NABEL
     Unless I lied about that as well.

  KELLER
     What do you mean, they're not dead?

  NABEL
     Give me the 'gate address, and I'll gladly tell
     you everything.

  ANNOTATION
     From the ground, Teyla kicks Nabel, knocking him
     off his feet. Now on the ground, she punches him
     with her tied hands, but she is still weak and
     crumbles. Nabel gets back on his knees and aims
     his pistol. Keller tackles him, struggling with
     him for the gun. She punches him in his wound to
     gain the upper hand, and is able to stand and aim
     the pistol.

  KELLER
     Don't move.

  TEYLA
     Untie me.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller starts towards Teyla, but Nabel blocks her
     path.

  KELLER
     Get out of the way.

  NABEL
     Give me the gun.

  KELLER
     I'll shoot you!

  NABEL
     No you won't. You don't have it in you. You're a
     doctor, a healer...not a killer.

  KELLER
     You're right, I am a healer. But first I need
     something to heal.

  ANNOTATION
     She shoots him in the leg. He collapses, yelling
     in agony. Keller runs over to Teyla and unties
     her. Teyla scrambles to her feet and takes the gun
     from Keller, aiming it at Nabel.

  TEYLA
     What happened to my people?! What happened to
     them?!

  ANNOTATION
     Bola Kai run into the area, surrounding them.
     Teyla points her pistol at them in a standoff.
     Shots are fired from behind the Bola Kai. The
     warriors scatter. Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon
     appear.

  SHEPPARD
     You okay?

  KELLER
     Yeah.

  RONON
     What happened?

  TEYLA
     My people. They are gone.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about? All of them? What
     happened?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks around for Nabel, but he has
     disappeared in the confusion.

  TEYLA
     Nabel! Where did he go?

  KELLER
     (shaking her head) I didn't see.

  SHEPPARD
     Who are you talking about?

  ANNOTATION
     The Bola Kai have regrouped. Arrows start flying
     at the team.

  MCKAY
     Ack! Not arrows!

  RONON
     We need to move. C'mon!

  SHEPPARD
     Let's go!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon leads Keller and Teyla out. Rodney and
     Sheppard provide cover fire as they all make their
     escape.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla lies in a hospital bed, dressed in scrubs.
     Sheppard comes to her bedside.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, how you feeling?

  TEYLA
     I am fine. Doctor Keller insists I remain in bed.
     She fears I have a concussion.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, you should listen to her. We just got back
     from New Athos. The Bola Kai are all gone. Must
     have scared them off. Rodney's got teams going out
     there to collect clues about what happened to your
     people.

  TEYLA
     Did you find Nabel?

  SHEPPARD
     (shaking his head) Searched the entire planet. No
     life signs.

  TEYLA
     He must have escaped through the 'gate.

  SHEPPARD
     Or more likely, he's lying dead somewhere.

  TEYLA
     He knows what happened to my people. I will find
     them.

  SHEPPARD
     I know you will, and we're gonna help you. But
     you've got to rest and get your strength back.

  TEYLA
     (determined) Whoever did this will pay. I will
     make certain of it.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller enters the area, checking some information
     on a computer. She wears an air-boot cast.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, Doc. How are you feeling?

  KELLER
     Oh, it's just a sprain. I'll be fine.

  TEYLA
     Why is it that you are allowed to resume working,
     and I am not?

  KELLER
     Because I didn't take half the beating you did.

  TEYLA
     I have suffered worse.

  KELLER
     Yeah, well, I believe you, but you're on my turf
     now, so you have to listen to me.

  SHEPPARD
     I'll check in on you later.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leaves. Teyla stares off into space.

  KELLER
     So...I got permission to go home for a few days of
     R&R. God bless that intergalactic gate bridge,
     huh? Anyway...I get to see my dad...and I have you
     to thank for that.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks at Keller now, her expression
     sympathetic. After a moment, she moves restlessly
     on the bed.

  TEYLA
     How long must I stay here?

  KELLER
     About another day or so.

  TEYLA
     I told you, I feel fine. I do not have a
     concussion.

  KELLER
     You're right. You don't. Teyla, I've looked over
     your test results. There's something we need to
     talk about.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks startled and worried.
