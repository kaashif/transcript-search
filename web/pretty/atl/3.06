She gets up and peeks through the Venetian blinds. There is a plastic patient id around her wrist. She notices it. She heads to the door, but finds it locked. The corridor outside is empty.

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>FLETCHER: You had just begun mediating the treaty for the U.N. when you collapsed mid-speech. You've been under a tremendous amount of stress recently. The treaty negotiation was the final straw that triggered what is known as a brief reactive psychosis. I know you're confused. This type of disorder can be very frightening, but the good news is your condition is most likely transitory. These episodes usually pass within a number of days.</td></tr>

I met you a few months ago, when we first approached you to help broker this non-proliferation treaty. I don't know anything about Atlantis! Except that it was a fairly mediocre "Donovan" song, not one of my favorites. Now, this Stargate program I'm supposed to have run--</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Weir watches O'Neill's head suddenly toss back and forth violently, like a television picture that's on the fritz. His hair briefly darkens as if another person is there. A moment later, O'Neill again looks normal and is unaware anything happened.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>O'NEILL: What?</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill walks away. Weir looks at another door to the side of the room. She looks at the muscular male orderly standing watch by the nurse's station and casually moves away, heading to the door. Another orderly suddenly steps in front of the door. Weir stops and acts like she's moving away. Instead she punches the orderly and tries to get through the door. The orderly is able to grab her and pull her away. He picks her up off her feet from behind. She kicks out at the desk and struggles.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>WEIR: I have brokered dozens of treaties, many of them very stressful, yes. But none of them bad enough to cause "significant emotional trauma."</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>FLETCHER: The treaty negotiation was just the trigger point. We believe the actual trauma you suffered occurred three weeks ago. You were riding in a car with a man named Simon Wallace.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>FLETCHER: You were coming home from dinner. A car ran a red light and broadsided you, impacting the driver's side door. Simon was killed instantly. You suffered only minor injuries in the crash, made a quick recovery. But in the days following Simon's funeral, several of your colleagues noticed your behavior changing. Clear signs of depression, confusion.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>WEIR: No.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>FLETCHER: It culminated in your collapse at the negotiation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>FLETCHER: Sometimes, the mind's only way to cope with tragedy is to completely erase it from memory...and on rare occasions, supplant it with something else. In this case, something--</td></tr>
