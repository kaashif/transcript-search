Search And Rescue Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--ATLANTIS QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla, dressed in nice civilian
     clothing, toast each other with wine glasses over
     a meal. The room is lit with candles.

  SHEPPARD
     This is perfect. Just what I needed.

  TEYLA
     It truly has been a hectic several weeks.

  SHEPPARD
     Try four years.

  TEYLA
     (grinning) Very true. In a way, it makes these
     calmer moments even more special. I cherish these
     times, when it is just you and me.

  SHEPPARD
     Me too.

  ANNOTATION
     They exchange looks. Sheppard shifts, suddenly
     awkward.

  SHEPPARD
     You, uh...you've got an early morning.

  TEYLA
     I never got to properly thank you.

  SHEPPARD
     For what?

  TEYLA
     For what? For rescuing me!

  ANNOTATION
     She grins. Sheppard looks puzzled.

  TEYLA
     From Michael! I never gave up hope, because I
     knew. I knew that you would come for me, John.

  SHEPPARD
     (voice faltering) I know this sounds crazy,
     but...I don't remember...rescuing you.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard turns away, studying the candlelight,
     trying to remember.

  FORD
     You don't remember rescuing her, because you
     didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard turns to find not Teyla sitting across
     from him, but Ford, looking haunted and accusing.

  FORD
     Just like you never rescued me.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gasps in pain and notices blood starting
     to stain his white shirt. He is bleeding from his
     right side.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard awakens with a gasp and coughs to find
     himself surrounded by rubble.

  RONON
     Sheppard! Hey, buddy.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's vision is blurred at first, but
     eventually he becomes alert. He is pinned under a
     metal beam. Ronon shifts around him.

  SHEPPARD
     (weak and hoarse) What happened?

  RONON
     Michael's compound. It collapsed on us.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard tries to move, but can't. The effort
     brings renewed pain and he groans.

  RONON
     (soothing) Hey...

  SHEPPARD
     (panting) I think I...I...

  RONON
     Yeah, let me take a look.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees a piece of metal reinforcement imbedded in
     Sheppard's side. He reaches forward and with a
     sudden move pulls the rebar out from where it's
     impaled his friend. Sheppard gasps and cries out
     in pain.

  SHEPPARD
     (weakly) Gaaah. What the hell was that?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon prepares a bandage.

  RONON
     Just a little scrape. No big deal.

  SHEPPARD
     What about the others?

  RONON
     I don't know. We got separated.

  SHEPPARD
     Try them on the radio.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, UPPER LEVEL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay can only get static on his radio. He is
     covered in dust with minor injuries. Lorne sits
     nearby, groaning in pain.

  MCKAY
     There's no signal. There's too much interference.

  LORNE
     (in pain) I'm pretty sure my leg is broken.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I think I'm remarkably fine.

  LORNE
     (sarcastic) Well, isn't that wonderful. That
     brings me great comfort. Thank you.

  MCKAY
     I don't think we're that deep. I can see daylight.
     If I can just...

  ANNOTATION
     He tries to shift some of the overhead debris and
     small rubble and dust rain down on them both.
     Lorne cries out in pain as some strike his injured
     leg.

  MCKAY
     I'm sorry! I just--

  LORNE
     I posted Edison at the entrance of the building.
     He'll get help.

  MCKAY
     That is assuming he wasn't hit by falling debris.

  LORNE
     Doc, the Daedalus left Atlantis when we were still
     confirming Sheppard's story. With that kind of a
     head start, they should be here in less
     than...three hours. So, one way or the other, help
     is on the way.

  MCKAY
     I'm sorry. I'm just-I'm not good at tight spaces.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay fidgets.

  LORNE
     Look, there's no bad guys around, okay? No bad
     guys. Just a lot of debris. So...if you could
     please just sit tight and try not to make the
     ceiling collapse, that would be great!

  MCKAY
     (nervously) Okay! No bad guys. Just got to...just
     sit tight.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks up through the ruins.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Panning out form the warehouse, past the orbit of
     the planet with one moon where the team is
     trapped, out through the rest of the system, past
     nebulas and across hyperspace, there is another
     system with a sole yellow star and a planet with
     two moons. In orbit there is Michael's ship.


LOCATION--BRIDGE, MICHAEL'S SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Kanaan brings Michael a report. Michael studies
     it, looking concerned at its contents.

  MICHAEL
     When did you get this?

  KANAAN
     Moments ago.

  MICHAEL
     (announcing) Change of plans! We're setting a new
     course. Our compound has been compromised.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Michael's ship enters hyperspace.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  BANKS
     Unscheduled offworld activation. It's Lieutenant
     Edison's IDC.

  ANNOTATION
     Edison, covered with dust, limps through the
     active wormhole. Carter meets him as technicians
     setting up equipment and a MALP stand nearby. He
     is bleeding and appears in shock.

  CARTER
     What happened? Where's the rest of your team?

  EDISON
     (gasping for breath) There was a massive
     explosion. Everyone was in the main compound. The
     whole building imploded on itself.

  CARTER
     Were there any survivors?

  EDISON
     Radios are down. Uh, I don't know. I just thought
     I should get back here.

  CARTER
     No, you did the right thing. (to medics) Get him
     to the infirmary.

  ANNOTATION
     Two medics escort Edison.

  CARTER
     (to Banks) How far away is the Daedalus?

  BANKS
     Still two hours out.

  CARTER
     We can't wait that long. Have the combat engineers
     gear up, and have Doctor Keller ready her away
     team.

  BANKS
     Yes, ma'am.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445 NIGHT


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, UPPER LEVEL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tries to hold pieces of computer equipment
     up to the light, discarding what he cannot
     salvage.

  LORNE
     What are you doing?

  MCKAY
     I'm claustrophobic. I'm trying to keep my mind
     busy, which is...hard because, you know, it's...my
     mind.

  LORNE
     (rolling his eyes) Yeah... Well, there's no way
     anything useful survived that implosion.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, speak for yourself.

  LORNE
     You know what I mean, Doc.

  MCKAY
     Look, I found a bunch of computer parts, all
     right. The motherboards are all fried or snapped,
     but some of these hard drives look like they might
     still be intact. If I could just get the power
     to...hello, hello!

  ANNOTATION
     His computer starts to show Wraith data.

  MCKAY
     Whoa!

  LORNE
     What is it? Something good?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. It's a lot of information. Hold
     on...I think I just hit the jackpot!

  LORNE
     What, someway to broadcast a signal? Let people
     know our location? Speed up the rescue? What?

  MCKAY
     (abashed) No, although in hindsight, I would say,
     you're right. That should probably be considered
     "the jackpot." But no, this is a hard-drive. I can
     only access what's on it.

  LORNE
     Which is?

  MCKAY
     It's Michael's wiki! It survived the explosion!

  LORNE
     The what?

  MCKAY
     (excited) Michael's database. It's a large chunk
     of it, maybe the whole thing, too. I mean, we've
     got, uh, base schematics, uh, uh, medical research
     information, lists of planets. I mean, you know
     what this means?

  LORNE
     (surly) Yeah, it means we're still stuck here, and
     I still have a broken leg.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, in the short term, but if we get out of
     here...?

  LORNE
     If?

  MCKAY
     We'd have him on the run. He'd be finished...Look,
     if Michael...

  ANNOTATION
     The computer beeps.

  MCKAY
     (worried) Oh no.

  LORNE
     What?

  MCKAY
     Look, I-I don't want to concern you any more than
     you actually already are, but if I'm reading this
     correctly, then Michael is--

  LORNE
     (listening intently) Shut up.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) No, no. You shut up, this is important!
     If Michael is--

  LORNE
     Ssh. Ssh! Quit making noise.

  ANNOTATION
     They both fall silent as a rhythmic creaking
     sounds above them.

  MCKAY
     It's footsteps.

  LORNE
     Okay, revise that. Start making noise! (calling
     out) Hey! Hey!

  MCKAY
     Down here! We're down here!

  LORNE
     Hey! Help!


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445, SURFACE

  ANNOTATION
     Above them, Carter leads the search and rescue
     team that's scouring the ruins. In her hands is a
     life signs detector.

  ENGINEER
     Peters! Yeah, bring them straight through!

  CARTER
     All right, we've got four life signs in two
     different locations. First two should be right
     beneath us.

  KELLER
     Listen.

  MCKAY AND LORNE
     (distant and muffled) Hey! Down here! Hey, hey!
     We're down here.

  CARTER
     (calling down) McKay, is that you?

  MCKAY
     Oh, thank god, yes!


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, UPPER LEVEL

  MCKAY
     I'm trapped down here with Lorne!

  CARTER
     (muffled, distant) Are you okay?

  MCKAY
     We're fine!

  LORNE
     Hey, Doc!

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures to his leg.

  MCKAY
     Right, right, right. Okay, Lorne's got a broken
     leg.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS SURFACE, M2S-445, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation continues to switch between the
     surface and McKay and Lorne's location.

  CARTER
     All right, McKay. Stay put. We've got combat
     engineers here. We're going to dig you out!

  MCKAY
     Well, hurry it up!

  CARTER
     We'll work as fast as is safe, Rodney!

  MCKAY
     No, no, no. You don't understand. I just found out
     that when the self-destruct is initiated, it's
     automatically programmed to send a subspace burst.
     Michael's probably already on his way.

  VEGA
     It doesn't like they're too far down. We should be
     able to get them out inside of an hour.

  KELLER
     Well, what about the other two?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter checks her scanner.

  CARTER
     They're a lot deeper.

  KELLER
     Well, the Daedalus will be here soon, so then we
     can just...beam them out, right?

  CARTER
     As long as Michael doesn't get here first.
     (calling out) All right, let's get started. (to
     Rivers) Rivers, take a jumper into orbit and keep
     a lookout for Michael's ship. Let me know the
     second he gets here.

  ANNOTATION
     The crew begins to work.

  ENGINEER
     Yeah, right through here. I got it...Yeah, we're
     ready.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, DEEPER LEVEL

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, okay. One...two...three!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Sheppard try to shift the beam pinning
     him, to no avail. Ronon pants with the effort.

  SHEPPARD
     This thing ain't moving. I wonder what happened to
     the others?

  RONON
     I don't know. It happened pretty quickly. I doubt
     that many people made it out.

  SHEPPARD
     So stupid. Of course the building was booby
     trapped. I should've seen that coming.

  RONON
     Yeah, well none of us did.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but I'm the guy. You know? Like "the guy."

  RONON
     Everyone knew what we were getting into. We all
     knew how dangerous it was, so don't beat yourself
     up about it.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, you need to start thinking about how to
     crawl your way out of here.

  RONON
     Aw, no way.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm serious. You just keeping moving up, keep
     moving the debris. Work your way up.

  RONON
     I'm not leaving you behind, Sheppard.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon tries to work with some pipes as a lever on
     the beam.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not trying to be a hero here. It's a selfish
     thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon strains trying to lift up the beam, but the
     pipe doesn't work.

  SHEPPARD
     I need you to dig a hole, so that the rescuers can
     come down and get me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon tries to shift the debris from underneath
     Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     That's the wrong way, Chief.

  RONON
     We get this beam off you. We get you free. We dig
     ourselves out together. Deal?

  SHEPPARD
     You ain't going to listen to me one way or the
     other, are you?

  RONON
     Great, deal.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard grunts and nods.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Michael's ship flies through hyperspace.


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla is strapped down on a table. Michael runs a
     scanner over her abdomen.

  MICHAEL
     Excellent. This is all very good. Your son should
     be making an appearance any day now.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla's expression is blank and stern. Michael
     appears nonplussed by her reaction.

  MICHAEL
     I thought that would make you happy. I can't
     imagine carrying a child inside of you is very
     comfortable... I will not harm him. Why can't you
     just accept that?

  TEYLA
     (with heavy emotion) Because I know you.

  MICHAEL
     All these worlds. Filled with "people", busying
     themselves with their pathetic lives. They come
     and they go. They live and they die, and the
     galaxy is no better for it. But your son...your
     son will be the instrument of change. He will be
     remembered for the ages.

  TEYLA
     And what of his mother? You speak often of his
     future, but never of mine. Why is that?

  ANNOTATION
     While Teyla speaks, Kanaan enters. He starts and
     listens intently to the conversation, staying in
     the background.

  MICHAEL
     I had hoped that you would...I had hoped that you
     would understand.

  KANAAN
     It's time.

  MICHAEL
     (swallowing) Very well. Remove the restraints, and
     post a guard outside this door.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael leaves. Kanaan removes the restraints.

  TEYLA
     I must escape before our child is born! He will
     kill me once I am of no use to him!

  KANAAN
     I can't.

  TEYLA
     Kanaan, why?

  KANAAN
     It's too dangerous.

  TEYLA
     For who?

  KANAAN
     He will kill us. (he looks at her belly) Kill us
     all.

  TEYLA
     Yes, he will. Whether you help me or not. You are
     disposable to him, can you not see that?

  ANNOTATION
     She clutches at him. He takes her hand.

  TEYLA
     Listen to me...

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm sounds. Kanaan pulls away and exits. The
     door closes behind him. Teyla struggles off the
     table trying to follow.

  TEYLA
     Kanaan, please! Please!

  ANNOTATION
     She is left behind.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS SURFACE, M2S-445, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The rescue team pulls McKay and his computer out
     of the hole. Keller is instantly there to treat
     him as he moves aside for Lorne to get out.

  MCKAY
     Hi. Hi. Hi.

  KELLER
     Come over here.

  MCKAY
     I'm fine. It's just a--just a couple scrapes.

  KELLER
     Wow. Rodney McKay refusing medical help. Now I
     really know there's something wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to run her scanner over him.

  MCKAY
     Seriously, I'm okay. Just--you should look after
     Lorne.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller looks over to where the team is just
     pulling Lorne out. She hurries over. Carter joins
     McKay.

  MCKAY
     Any survivors?

  CARTER
     We found two other life signs, but they're buried
     under a lot more debris than you were, so it's
     going to take a little longer. We've got people
     working on it.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and Vega help Lorne down. He stifles a cry
     as he's lowered to the floor.

  MCKAY
     You know who it is?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) Not yet. Rodney, did you find
     Teyla?

  MCKAY
     No. No, but I think Sheppard was right. He was
     going to bring her here. We just--we came too
     soon.

  RIVERS
     (over radio) Colonel Carter?

  CARTER
     (into radio) Go ahead.

  RIVERS
     Ma'am, a Wraith cruiser just came out of
     hyperspace.

  CARTER
     (to McKay) Michael's here.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Michael's ship orbits the planet.

  KANAAN
     Multiple life signs. It must be the Atlantians.

  MICHAEL
     (smiling) They're combing the debris. But they
     must know it's too dangerous to stay here. They're
     searching for survivors. This might not be a total
     loss after all.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445, NIGHT

  CARTER
     Everyone, fall back to your jumpers!

  ANNOTATION
     The search and rescue crew begin to evacuate. A
     dart can be heard in the distance.

  VEGA
     We've got incoming!

  ANNOTATION
     A dart flies overhead. Vega strafes it with
     weapons fire. She hits it, and it veers off.

  KELLER
     Good shot!

  CARTER
     All right, let's fall back to our jumpers.

  MCKAY
     We've still got men trapped down here.

  CARTER
     They're going to have to wait. We're no good to
     them out in the open like this. Let's go! Fall
     back!

  ANNOTATION
     The crew continue to evacuate.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Some of the engineers stow into the rear
     compartment of a jumper. McKay, Carter, Keller,
     and Vega get into the forward compartment, McKay
     immediately getting into the pilot's chair.

  CARTER
     Cloak the ship.

  MCKAY
     Got it.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter studies the copilot controls.

  CARTER
     We're getting a reading. The 'gate's been
     activated.

  MCKAY
     It's classic Wraith battle technique. They dial
     the 'gate, lock everyone out, make sure they can't
     escape.

  CARTER
     (ruefully) Well, it's a good one.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, they're not idiots.

  ANNOTATION
     He calls up the HUD.

  MCKAY
     They've got more darts on the way, and they've
     already got troops on the debris field.

  VEGA
     They must know we've got people down there.

  MCKAY
     How many jumpers do we have?

  CARTER
     Three including this one.

  MCKAY
     I'm reading over twenty darts.

  KELLER
     But they can't see us, though, right?

  MCKAY
     Well, not right now, but we can't fire while we're
     cloaked.

  CARTER
     Look, it's going to take them time to dig them
     out, the same as us. We wait for the Daedalus.
     Rodney, take us into orbit.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF MICHAEL'S SHIP

  KANAAN
     Darts reporting minimal resistance. They've
     already started searching the debris.

  MICHAEL
     We must work fast. I need them alive.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper flies in orbit. The Wraith ship can be
     seen through the window.

  MCKAY
     There it is.

  KELLER
     Is that Michael's cruiser?

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) Well, it looks like it.

  KELLER
     Does that mean that Teyla's on that ship?

  CARTER
     It's possible.

  KELLER
     Well, that's great, though, right? I mean, when
     the Daedalus shows up, we can just beam her up
     too, no?

  MCKAY
     It's not as easy as that.

  CARTER
     Chances are Michael's already removed her
     transmitter, and even if he hasn't, Wraith
     cruisers surround themselves with an
     electromagnetic jamming field--no beaming in, no
     beaming out.

  KELLER
     (devastated) We're so close!

  ANNOTATION
     The others look just as concerned.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE RUINS

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard struggles to stay conscious. Ronon finds
     more debris to act as a lever.

  RONON
     Hey, come on. One more try.

  SHEPPARD
     (groaning) Mmm. I'm feeling pretty weak, buddy.

  RONON
     You're not quitting on me yet, are you?

  SHEPPARD
     (weakly) No... Uh, well, I was thinking about it.

  RONON
     That wasn't part of our deal.

  SHEPPARD
     You keep adding things to this "deal" of ours.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon has moved to the other side of Sheppard,
     trying to push the beam off.

  RONON
     Right. Ready? One...two...three.

  ANNOTATION
     It moves a few inches, but not enough to be of any
     consequence. Ronon cries out from the strain.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon...you need to get out of here.

  RONON
     Would you leave me if I was stuck under there?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a scraping sound from overhead.

  RONON
     You hear that?

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  RONON
     It sounds like digging.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I hear it. I hear it.

  RONON
     (shouting) Hey! Hey, we're down here!

  WORKER
     (muffled through debris) We're coming for you!
     Just stay calm!

  RONON
     Huh. And you were going to quit.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives Sheppard a relieved grin. Sheppard sighs
     and lies back.

  CARTER
     (over radio) Long story short, that's Michael's
     cruiser, and he likely has Teyla on board.

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) So I can't blow him out of the sky.

  CARTER
     (over radio) No, I'm afraid not.

  WORKER
     (muffled, but louder) Stay calm. We're almost

  SHEPPARD

     combat engineers as of today, I promise. Harris up
     there with you?

  WORKER
     (after a pause) Yes, he's there. Don't worry,

  SHEPPARD
     Shoot till we can't shoot anymore.

  RONON

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between the
     jumper and Daedalus.

  CALDWELL
     We'd have to drop our shields. I kind of think
     that would be a bad idea now.

  CARTER
     Look, if Michael gets his hands on them, he'll
     kill them. We don't have a choice.

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell sighs.

  CALDWELL
     (to Marks) All right, get ready to drop the
     shields. As soon as they're down, beam Ronon and
     Sheppard directly to the infirmary.

  MARKS
     Yes, sir.

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Sam, you might as well bring your

  CALDWELL
     Not so good. We've lost sub-light, hyperdrive, and
     Asgard weapons. Life support's down to fifty
     percent.

  MCKAY

     At another bed, Keller gives Sheppard a
     preliminary examination.

  KELLER
     We thought we'd lost you there.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well for a second, I thought we'd lost me.
     It's going to be okay, though, right?

  KELLER
     Yeah...you need some serious work, but you should,
     you know "live to fight another day" and all that.

  SHEPPARD
     So, what's going on? I guess Michael showed up
     before the Daedalus...

  KELLER
     Yeah, we had to lower the shields to beam you up
     here.

  SHEPPARD
     Sorry about that.

  KELLER
     I'm sure McKay and Colonel Carter will be able to
     fix it.

  SHEPPARD
     (stunned) McKay's alive?

  KELLER
     Yeah. Yeah, he and Lorne were the only two to make
     it out of the rubble.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard struggles to get out of bed.

  SHEPPARD
     Patch me up. I need to get back out there.

  KELLER
     What? No, no, no! No. You've lost a lot of blood!
     Look, you will be fine, but you're far from it
     now. You've lost a lot of blood. You need surgery
     and a transfusion. I mean, this can't wait.

  SHEPPARD
     Look, Doc, Michael's...here. That means Teyla's
     probably on the ship. I'm too close to sit here
     and do nothing.

  KELLER
     You're not going to be sitting around doing
     nothing. You're going to be laying here in
     surgery.

  SHEPPARD
     Look, there's got to be, there's got to be a quick
     fix. I just need a few hours.

  KELLER
     No. I'm sorry, I can't!

  ANNOTATION
     Keller starts to move away. Sheppard grabs her
     arm.

  SHEPPARD
     I have had the chance to rescue a teammate before,
     and it slipped through my hands. I am not letting
     that happen again.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

     Carter is working at a control panel. McKay is
     working with a grouping of crystals. The power
     comes back on.

  CARTER
     Nice one!

  MCKAY
     Of course. Life support's still not working at
     full power, but, uh, at least we won't freeze to
     death.

  CARTER
     Well, I've almost got sub-light back online, but
     the way these guys are taxing their shields, we
     won't have any power to spare anyway. We need to
     take out the cruiser's main weapons.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, with what?

  CARTER
     We could launch a 302 attack.

  SHEPPARD
     That's what I was thinking.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay turn to find Ronon and Sheppard
     standing at the doorway. Sheppard is wearing a
     fresh tee-shirt.

  CARTER
     (surprised) Colonel. Doctor Keller said you were
     out of commission.

     idea.

  RONON
     Maybe a way to get Teyla back.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Sheppard's team brief Caldwell.

  CARTER
     We need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.
     Easiest way for us to do that right now is to
     launch an attack with 302s.

  CALDWELL
     Well, I wouldn't exactly call that easy. They'll
     just send out darts to intercept them.

  RONON
     That's what we're counting on.

  MCKAY
     In order to launch the darts, they'll have to open
     the bay doors. If we have a cloaked jumper in
     place, a small team should be able to sneak onto
     the cruiser undetected.

  SHEPPARD
     Find Teyla. Bust her out. Blast our way home.

  CALDWELL
     (dryly) As a rule, I like to keep daring rescues
     down to one a day.

  CARTER
     Shields are already down to twenty percent. It's
     just a matter of time before they fail completely.
     She's over there, Stephen--counting on us. I won't
     take no for an answer.

  ANNOTATION
     They all look to Caldwell, who's considering the
     options.

  CALDWELL
     All right, take a cloaked jumper. Radio us when
     you're in position.

  SHEPPARD
     (weakly) Nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs his arm, stopping him.

  CARTER
     (skeptically) So you're telling me, if I go down
     there right now and talk to Jennifer, she'll tell
     me that you're fit for duty.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm just trying to do a job.

  CARTER
     So am I. And part of my job is determining whether
     or not you're going to be a liability on this
     mission.

  SHEPPARD
     (determined) Colonel, I have more respect for you
     than any commanding officer I've ever had,
     but...I'm getting on that jumper. End of story.
     I'll surrender for court-martial when I'm done.

     He reads the results on his tablet computer.

  MCKAY
     That's...troubling.

  RONON
     (impatient) What?

  MCKAY
     Michael's a lot further ahead in his repairs than
     I would've thought. The hyperdrive's almost back
     online. We've got to make this quick.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you mean "quick"?

  MCKAY
     Well, like, fifteen minutes is not a lot of time.

  SHEPPARD
     No, that's not a lot of time. So, why don't you
     tell us where Teyla is already?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns back to his computer.

     Looks like Michael's got his hyperdrive back
     online. It's powering up.

  SHEPPARD

  MCKAY
     Not from this little thing. Look, the drive room
     is just down the corridor. You slap a-a C-4 charge

  MCKAY
     Oh yeah. Yeah, I-I had a kidney stone once.
     Incredibly painful. Same kind of thing from what
     I'm told, so I-I hear ya. Actually, my cat and I
     had one at the same time. We were not fun to be
     around, I'll tell you that much. He got his 'cause
     he was eating too much of the dry cat food; I got
     mine 'cause I wasn't drinking enough liquids.
     That's why you always see my hydrating. I have no
     desire to experience that kind of pain again. Oh,
     it's just--

  TEYLA

  MCKAY
     Yeah, it's no problem.

  TEYLA
     People have been having babies for thousands of
     years. Most of them without doctors.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but before doctors, the infant mortality
     rate was incredibly high. It was only like one in

     Okay, I can do this. All right, look, I may have-I
     may have panicked a little back there, but we're
     gonna do this. We're gonna do this. I am great
     with kids--the little ones, the ones that don't
     talk back.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes off his jacket to wrap the baby. Teyla
     winces as another contraction starts.

  TEYLA
     Here it comes!

  ANNOTATION
     She screams again as McKay reaches down with the
     jacket, wincing and groaning in disgust.

  MCKAY
     Okay, almost there. Almost there.

  ANNOTATION
     They both groan again. Finally the baby is out.

  MCKAY
     (elated) Oh! I caught him! I caught him! I--

  ANNOTATION
     The baby cries. McKay looks at him in wonder.

  MCKAY
     He's a boy.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla laughs in relief.

  TEYLA
     Watch his head.

  MCKAY
     Right, right. Okay, so, cut. Okay, look at him. Do
     I get to cut the cord? I get to cut the cord then,
     right?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, okay, so...okay. Teyla, I'd like to
     introduce you to your son.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds the baby out to her. The child is wrapped
     in McKay's jacket. Teyla laughs in delight. Ronon
     and Sheppard rush in and stare at the scene.

  SHEPPARD
     Wow.

  MCKAY
     (delighted) I caught it. It didn't hit the floor
     or anything.

  TEYLA
     He did a wonderful job.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon crouches by Teyla.

  SHEPPARD
     That's good...you did good, Rodney. All right,
     we-we've got to get you out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods.

  TEYLA
     Ronon, you're going to need to help me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon cradles her in his arms easily as she
     cradles the baby. McKay grabs his pack and
     computer as they all leave.


LOCATION--BAY AREA, MICHAEL'S SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at where they parked the jumper.
     Sheppard keys the remote, but nothing happens.

  SHEPPARD
     Why isn't it de-cloaking?

  MCKAY
     (taking the remote) Let me see. Did you break it?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, no. We parked the jumper right here.

  MCKAY
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard waves his arms around trying to find the
     ship.

  RONON
     One hundred percent.

  MCKAY
     Someone stole the jumper?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, this is not good.

  MCKAY
     I told you, you should have stayed here.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay futilely keeps trying the remote.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, MICHAEL'S SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     The team make their way guardedly through the
     ship's corridors.

  RONON
     How the hell are we supposed to get off this ship
     now?

  ANNOTATION
     They all look to McKay.

  MCKAY
     I just delivered a baby! That's not enough for
     today?

  SHEPPARD
     Don't they have escape pods or things like that on
     a cruiser?

  MCKAY
     No, they--they-- Wait, I know. I need to get back
     to a data terminal. A lot of their internal
     power's down. Maybe I can short out their jamming
     code. We can get the Daedalus to beam us out.

  SHEPPARD
     Great. Lead the way.

  ANNOTATION
     They head down a corridor. As they head down a
     passageway, they startle Kanaan, who is coming
     from the other direction. They each raise their
     weapons.

  TEYLA
     Don't shoot! (to Ronon) Put me down.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon does, raising his weapon. Teyla cradles the
     baby as she touches Sheppard reassuringly.

  TEYLA
     It's all right, John. This is Kanaan. He is the
     father.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard lowers his weapon slightly, looking
     warily from Teyla to Kanaan. Teyla approaches
     Kanaan. He lowers his weapon and stares at her and
     the baby. He caresses his son.

  TEYLA
     This is our chance. These are the friends I told
     you of. They can help you get back to your old
     self. But first, you have to help us. We must get
     off this ship! Do you know a way?

  KANAAN
     Yes. Follow me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon still has his weapon raised.

  RONON
     No offense, Teyla, but I don't trust this guy.

  TEYLA
     He has tried to save me before. I trust him.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard walks over.

  SHEPPARD
     Give me your weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     Kanaan immediately does.

  SHEPPARD
     What's your plan?


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A single dart flies towards the Daedalus.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is no longer on the bridge.

  MARKS
     Sir...we've got a dart trying to hail us.

  CALDWELL
     What? Let me hear it.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) This is Colonel John Sheppard.
     Authentication code Bravo Delta Charlie Alpha
     Niner. Daedalus, please come in.

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Authenticated. Colonel Sheppard, what
     the hell happened to your jumper?


LOCATION--DART

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between
     Caldwell's and Sheppard's locations.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I got turned around in the parking garage. I
     was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart. I've got
     the team beamed into a storage device.

  CALDWELL
     Do you have Teyla?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, and the baby.

  CALDWELL
     (incredulous) You beamed a baby into Wraith
     storage?

  SHEPPARD
     No. I've got him right here.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks down at the infant cradled in his arms.

  SHEPPARD
     So...feel free to do whatever you want to that
     cruiser.

  CALDWELL
     Copy that. (to Marks) Major Marks, please make
     that ship go away.

  MARKS
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Marks activates his controls.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Daedalus fires a beam weapon at the cruiser,
     destroying it.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Colonel Sheppard, why don't you head
     down to the planet, beam your crew out, and land
     that dart? I'm pretty sure you can dial up that
     Stargate now.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Copy that.


LOCATION--DART

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard fusses with the sleepy infant.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay heads down a corridor carrying a bouquet of
     flowers. He passes Carter, who's heading the other
     direction, carrying two large duffle bags.

  MCKAY
     Hey, what's with the bags?

  CARTER
     What's with the flowers?

  MCKAY
     Going to see Teyla. Oh, you probably heard. I
     delivered her baby.

  CARTER
     (brightly) I did! And they tell me she's going to
     name him Rodney!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay does a fist pump.

  MCKAY
     Yes! Really?

  CARTER
     No. Not really.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's face falls.

  MCKAY
     (flatly) Oh, that's funny. Where are you going?

  CARTER
     Back to Earth.

  MCKAY
     What? Why?

  CARTER
     Oh, they caught the last Ba'al clone. The Tok'ra
     are going to extract the symbiote. They want SG-1
     to put in an appearance.

  MCKAY
     Okay...?

  CARTER
     Plus, the IOA want to do an "exhaustive" review of
     my first year in command, so, you know...that
     can't be good.

  MCKAY
     Are you crazy? They probably want to give you a
     medal. You had a great year. I know my opinion
     doesn't mean much to those folks, but, um...I
     think you've done an excellent job. I'm glad you
     took the post.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles.

  CARTER
     Thanks, Rodney, that means a lot. Tell Sheppard
     the court martial will have to wait.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks puzzled.

  MCKAY
     Sure. See you soon.

  ANNOTATION
     They part ways.

  CARTER
     (nervously, under her breath) Hope so.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Sheppard are in beds next to each other
     in the infirmary. Teyla holds her son. Sheppard is
     playing a hand-held video game.

  TEYLA
     How long will the surgery take?

  SHEPPARD
     Doc says a few hours. But I'll be off my feet for
     a week or so.

  TEYLA
     I cannot believe you attempted to mount a rescue
     in your condition.

  SHEPPARD
     "Attempted?" Last time I checked, I succeeded!
     How's the kid?

  TEYLA
     Doctor Keller says he's perfectly healthy. I say
     he's perfectly everything.

  SHEPPARD
     (smiling, nodding) That's great. That's great.

  TEYLA
     I want to thank you.

  SHEPPARD
     There's no need.

  TEYLA
     I never gave up hope, because I knew. I knew that
     you would come for me, John.

  SHEPPARD
     You would've done the same for me.

  TEYLA
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller arrives, wearing her surgical scrubs.

  KELLER
     All right, you ready, Colonel?

  SHEPPARD
     Ready? From my understanding, I...I'm not doing
     anything.

  KELLER
     (brightly) Yeah, that's right. You just have to
     lay still and let me play with your insides.

  ANNOTATION
     No one else is amused by her joke.

  KELLER
     Sorry. Um, let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     The surgical team starts to wheel Sheppard away.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Teyla) What are you gonna name the kid?

  TEYLA
     Well, if it's all right with you, I was thinking
     of Torren John. After my father, and after you.

  SHEPPARD
     Really? Wow.

  KELLER
     (amused) McKay's going to hate that.

  SHEPPARD
     I would be very honored!

  TEYLA
     Very well. Torren John Emmagan.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter heads down the ramp as the wormhole shuts
     off. Woolsey is waiting for her at the bottom of
     the ramp.

  WOOLSEY
     Colonel Carter.

  CARTER
     Mister Woolsey, how are you?

  WOOLSEY
     Very well, thank you for asking.

  CARTER
     (hopefully) So, is this whole "evaluation process"
     going to take very long? I mean, there's a lot of
     work to be done on Atlantis, and I'm kind of
     anxious to get back.

  WOOLSEY
     (awkwardly) I'm sure you are. However, the IOA has
     decided that perhaps someone with a different
     skill set would be more suited to lead the
     Atlantis expedition now.

  CARTER
     (nonplussed) Excuse me?

  WOOLSEY
     I'm here to inform you that, effective
     immediately, you are being removed from command.

  CARTER
     (shocked) Um...who-who's replacing me?

  WOOLSEY
     As a matter of fact...I am.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stands nodding, stunned.
