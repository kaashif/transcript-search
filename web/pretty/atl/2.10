The Lost Boys Part 1
TEASER

LOCATION--PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team makes their way through a thick
     forest.

  MCKAY
     This is ridiculous.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, keep complaining about it, and we may get
     there faster.

  MCKAY
     Well, couldn't we have met these people on a
     tropical beach planet, populated by tall, blonde
     women? Hmm?

  TEYLA
     Whoever wants to speak with us obviously values
     their privacy.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well, I value my time, and this is a waste of
     it.

  SHEPPARD
     What's a waste of time is listening to you,
     Rodney. This is the mission.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, it strikes me that this is a mission
     better suited to one of the lower echelon teams.

  RONON
     "Lower echelon"?

  TEYLA
     He means to say "less important."

  SHEPPARD
     We got a tip from one of Teyla's contacts. We're
     following it up.

  MCKAY
     And this is, like, what, the umpteenth tip we've
     followed up in search of a ZPM?

  TEYLA
     Rodney--

  MCKAY
     Look, I just want to make it clear that every
     second I am out of my lab is a second the galaxy
     goes without another groundbreaking--

  ANNOTATION
     Men hiding in the forest come forward and shoot
     all four members of the team with stun weapons.
     Sheppard and the others fall to the ground,
     unconscious.

  KANAYO
     We have to get them to the gate before their
     people realize they're missing.

  ANNOTATION
     The men take the weapons from Sheppard and the
     others.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and the others are seated around a large
     wooden dining table when hoods are removed from
     their heads. Men dressed in a variety of homespun
     clothing surround them.

  SHEPPARD
     You guys okay?

  MCKAY
     (upset) Oh, yeah. Fine.

  SHEPPARD
     Seems like a whole lot of trouble to go through
     just to get us to dinner... Not a talkative bunch,
     are you?

  KANAYO
     If we release you from your bindings, do you
     promise not to attack us?

  RONON
     Sure.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we promise.

  ANNOTATION
     Aiden Ford enters, chuckling. Ronon tries to get
     up and approach him, but other men hold him back.

  FORD
     Before we untie them, they have to know that
     they're among friends.

  SHEPPARD
     Ford?

  FORD
     You thought I was dead, didn't you, Sheppard?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard exchanges looks with the rest of the
     team. Ford smiles mildly, the left side of his
     face still altered by the earlier Wraith injury.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     There is a plate of food in front of each of
     Sheppard's team. They are now untied.

  FORD
     Guys... Guys, please, eat. Eat.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford takes a bit from Teyla's plate. Ronon sniffs
     the food. Ronon and McKay start to eat.

  FORD
     (to his men) Well, men, this used to be my team.
     (indicating Ronon) Well, not this one... but I
     think he's okay, too.

  SHEPPARD
     What is all this?

  FORD
     Just some local vegetables, a sort of alligator
     thing. It tastes like salted meat. It's good. Try.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not talking about the food. What the hell is
     going on?

  TEYLA
     Who are these men? And why bring us here like
     this?

  FORD
     Whoa. That's a lot of questions.

  RONON
     Pick one.

  FORD
     "Pick one." That's good. Where'd you find him,
     Sheppard?

  MCKAY
     (speaking with his mouth full) Maybe you should
     start with how you managed to escape being culled
     by the Wraith Dart?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gives him a look.

  MCKAY
     Hmm? What? When I get nervous, I get hungry.

  FORD
     Okay. The Dart...

  BEGIN FLASHBACK



LOCATION--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     From "2.03 Runner", Sheppard has hit gun aimed at
     Ford.

  SHEPPARD
     Ford! You're not getting off this planet.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford jumps into the Wraith culling beam from the
     Dart that passes by.


LOCATION--WRAITH SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Ford wakes up on the Wraith ship.

  FORD
     (voiceover) I have no idea how long I was in the
     Dart. Next thing I knew, I was on a cruiser, and I
     was awake.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  MCKAY
     (still eating) It's the enzyme. It makes you
     almost immune to the Wraith stunner, so when you
     dematerialize from the Wraith Dart, you're awake,
     as opposed to...

  FORD
     As opposed to dead.

  BEGIN FLASHBACK



LOCATION--WRAITH SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Awake, Ford grabs a knife and stabs the Wraith
     soldier standing over him. He grabs its weapon and
     fires on the Wraith. Then he kneels beside it with
     his knife.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  FORD
     I cut open his enzyme pouch, took my fill, and
     made my way off the ship.

  BEGIN FLASHBACK



LOCATION--WRAITH SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Ford makes his way through the ship.

  FORD
     (voiceover) You can get around pretty easy on a
     Wraith ship. They're not used to people making it
     aboard, so there's next to no security.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford shoots another Wraith soldier and bends to
     cut into its arm for the enzyme pouch.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  FORD
     I walked off with enough enzyme to last me a
     little while, tracked down the Stargate, dialed
     the first friendly address I could remember.

  BEGIN FLASHBACK



LOCATION--TAVERN

  ANNOTATION
     Ford enters the tavern and sees Kanayo.

  FORD
     I need a place to stay, a hot meal.

  KANAYO
     And what do you got to trade?

  ANNOTATION
     Ford takes out a Wraith stunner and puts it on the
     bar.

  FORD
     What'll that get me?

  ANNOTATION
     A bouncer grabs him from behind.

  BOUNCER
     No weapons.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford slams the bouncer's head into the bar and
     lets him fall to the floor. He turns back to
     Kanayo.

  FORD
     So? What'll that get me?

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Ford is eating while Kanayo looks on.

  KANAYO
     I still don't really understand.

  FORD
     Look at me. I got shot; I healed. I can see
     farther, clearer than I ever saw before.
     (voiceover) I told them about the enzyme, how it
     makes you stronger, more aware, more resilient,
     how it would give us a fighting chance against the
     Wraith...


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  FORD
     I mean, look at me. Look at me! I walked off a
     Wraith cruiser. It works.

  BEGIN FLASHBACK



LOCATION--TAVERN

  KANAYO
     I want to try it.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford shakes hands with Kanayo.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  RONON
     Wait a second. All your people here...all your
     men...they're on the enzyme?

  FORD
     Of course.

  BEGIN FLASHBACK



LOCATION--FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kanayo and other of Ford's men stalk a Wraith
     patrol of two. They ambush and fire on them. One
     of the men starts to cut the enzyme from a Wraith.

  KANAYO
     No. We don't do it like that anymore. Let's gate
     them back home.

  ANNOTATION
     The men drag the Wraith across the planet.

  FORD
     (voiceover) As our numbers kept growing, we needed
     more and more of the enzyme.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Ford's men spar as Kanayo and others drag the
     Wraith in to put them beside other Wraith. All the
     Wraith are shackled and unmoving. Ford enters.

  FORD
     Nice work.

  KANAYO
     Thank you.

  FORD
     That should give us a steady stream of the enzyme.
     Time to focus on some bigger issues.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  TEYLA
     Aiden do you mean to tell us that there are live
     Wraith here in this cave?

  FORD
     That's right.

  TEYLA
     The Wraith can communicate with each other over a
     distance.

  FORD
     But not between stars. They'd have to be in this
     solar system. (indicting McKay) You taught me
     that.

  MCKAY
     (still eating) Yes, well, good for me.

  FORD
     (chuckling) What's the matter? They can't
     communicate if they're unconscious.

  SHEPPARD
     Why'd you jump us?

  FORD
     Yeah... Yeah, I'm sorry about that. It was the
     only way to get you here.

  SHEPPARD
     Why didn't you just tell us where you were? You
     know we would have come.

  FORD
     Yeah, you and a special ops team.

  SHEPPARD
     (unconvincingly) No, no.

  FORD
     I know you think I'm crazy. I brought you all here
     to show you that you're wrong. I mean, do I look
     crazy? Do I seem...out of control?

  MCKAY
     Are we speaking in relative terms, or, um...

  FORD
     Look... Jace here has really fine-tuned the
     enzyme. We know how to administer it now, how to
     regulate it, refine it... We've gotten so good, we
     can even lace food with it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla, Ronon, and McKay all stop eating.

  MCKAY
     Excuse me?

  FORD
     Congratulations. You've just had your first dose.

  MCKAY
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay spits ou the food in his mouth. Ronon pulls
     some out.

  FORD
     I thought long and hard about how to show you that
     the enzyme was safe... Convince you that it was
     the first step to defeating the Wraith, so you'd
     convince Weir, convince the military.

  MCKAY
     (standing, furious) Are you out of your mind?

  FORD
     Hey, settle down, McKay.

  MCKAY
     (screaming) No, I will not settle down! I have
     been drugged against my will, you little punk!

  TEYLA
     You should not have done this, Aiden.

  FORD
     Hey, be as mad as you want. Couple of days, you'll
     be thanking me. We'll all have a good laugh about
     this. Now, eat up.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford walks out. Ronon gets up, but a man holds a
     stunner to his face.

  MCKAY
     (panicking) I'm itchy. I'm itchy all over. This is
     exactly what happened when I toked pot once in
     college.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stands up.

  SHEPPARD
     Everyone stay put.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks toward where Ford has gone, in an
     adjacent room. Men stop him.

  FORD
     Let him go.


LOCATION--ROOM IN CAVE

  SHEPPARD
     Ford... look... I know what you're trying to do. I
     get it, I do, but you're going about this all
     wrong. Weir isn't going to listen to us if we're
     all hopped up on the enzyme.

  FORD
     Your food was clean.

  SHEPPARD
     Why? Why me?

  FORD
     You're going to be the witness. You're going to be
     the one to tell Weir that her most trusted team
     has taken the enzyme and is better because of it.

  SHEPPARD
     Look, buddy...why don't you come back with us?
     Have Beckett look you over. That's the best proof.

  FORD
     No. No, I've thought this through. This is the
     plan.

  SHEPPARD
     Look, I don't know what you're thinking--

  FORD
     You're free to roam around as much as you want.
     You're all a part of the team now.


LOCATION--DHD ON PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works on the DHD. Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon
     are with him.

  RONON
     Okay so why aren't these guys watching us?

  TEYLA
     Ronon is right. They went to great trouble to get
     us here. Why would they allow us to leave?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

  MCKAY
     Oh, that little bastard.

  SHEPPARD
     There it goes.

  MCKAY
     This is what I was afraid of.

  SHEPPARD
     What did he do?

  MCKAY
     He's taken all the necessary control crystals,
     something I showed him how to do on a mission, I
     might add.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that's not good.

  MCKAY
     That is the understatement of the year.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. See what you can do.

  RONON
     Okay, why don't we just take them? All we've got
     to do is get our hands on one stunner and I can
     take them all.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, maybe, but if we mess it up, whatever trust
     we might have been given will disappear.

  TEYLA
     You want to make them trust us?

  SHEPPARD
     We play it cool. We let them get comfortable.
     They're bound to make a mistake.

  TEYLA
     (skeptical) And in the meantime?

  SHEPPARD
     We play along... How are you guys feeling?

  RONON
     I didn't eat that much. I feel fine.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps if we were able to fast they will be
     unable to administer the enzyme. I doubt that. I
     don't think they'd have a problem forcing us.

  MCKAY
     Okay, well, this thing is useless, and I ate my
     face off, and I can tell you, I can feel it
     working. There's a good possibility that
     everything you're feeling right now might be
     psychosomatic.

  MCKAY
     Oh, is that right, Professor Science? Is that your
     expert opinion?

  ANNOTATION
     They start to walk away from the DHD.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, it is.

  MCKAY
     Well, I can tell you, when they up the dosage, the
     side effects will be very real and very
     unpredictable.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, EVENING


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  WEIR
     You're back early.

  LORNE
     Ah, Jenev's kind of a closed society. Very polite
     and very courteous, but completely uninterested in
     having anything to do with us.

  WEIR
     Well, better that than hostile, I suppose. Colonel
     Sheppard's team is three hours overdue.

  LORNE
     It wouldn't be the first time. Any radio contact?

  WEIR
     None since they left.

  LORNE
     (smiling) Well, you know those guys.

  WEIR
     What do I know about those guys?

  LORNE
     (unconcerned) Just that they tend to get all
     caught up in whatever it is they're doing, and
     sometimes they don't check in. They forget how
     much you worry. That we worry. Collectively, I
     mean.

  WEIR
     (subtly pressuring) Yes, we do.

  LORNE
     (relenting) Yeah...we do. (to his team) Okay,
     guys, looks like we're heading back out.

  WEIR
     Thank you, Major.

  LORNE
     You're welcome.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay paces nervously.

  MCKAY
     Seriously, I'm getting, uh... I'm getting chills
     and hot flashes, chills and hot flashes, again and
     again. None of you are feeling that?

  RONON
     (agitated, to Sheppard) The enzyme side effects
     are going to be the least of his concerns if he
     keeps this up.

  SHEPPARD
     I know. Just be patient.

  RONON
     Historically, that hasn't been a strength for me.

  SHEPPARD
     (emphatically) I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford enters.

  FORD
     Sheppard, Teyla. Kanayo's running a mission
     off-world. I want you to go with him.

  SHEPPARD
     Why?

  FORD
     We're running an op. I thought you might want to
     see the men in action.

  SHEPPARD
     Sure. Wherever you need us.

  TEYLA
     Just give us some weapons, and--

  FORD
     Nice try. No, you're going to hang back and watch
     with Kanayo. Don't worry. You won't be in any
     danger.

  SHEPPARD
     That's a load off of my mind.

  FORD
     Good.

  MCKAY
     What about us?

  FORD
     Jace will give you the grand tour, show you what
     we've done with the place. How does that sound?

  MCKAY
     It sounds delightful.

  FORD
     Okay, good. Then if Sheppard tries anything
     off-world, you'll be nice and close for me to kill
     you both.

  MCKAY
     Can't think of a better way of spending the
     afternoon.

  ANNOTATION
     Kanayo points a gun at Teyla and gestures for the
     to leave.

  KANAYO
     Move.

  FORD
     Looks like he's itching to go.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon walks menacingly around Ford, grabs his
     coat, and knocks over a chair before leaving.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE


LOCATION--PLANET, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     There is a village in the distance.


LOCATION--FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Ford, Sheppard, and the others watch as a group of
     men run by on a trail.

  SHEPPARD
     Are those guards Genii?

  KANAYO
     Yes.

  TEYLA
     What exactly are we doing here?

  KANAYO
     The Genii have spies all over the galaxy. If for
     whatever reason one of them can't make it back to
     the Genii home-world, their leaders have
     established safe houses. If they need a place to
     reload on gear or a place to hide, they come here.

  SHEPPARD
     That's useful.

  KANAYO
     Yeah. We've found it to be an excellent source of
     information and supplies.

  TEYLA
     How did you find them in the first place?

  KANAYO
     I was a Genii spy.

  SHEPPARD
     If you're one of them, why don't you just walk in
     there?

  KANAYO
     Well, I used to but eventually they realized I'd
     betrayed them.

  SHEPPARD
     I can see how they would.

  KANAYO
     We rely on raids now.

  SHEPPARD
     Why? What more do you guys want?

  KANAYO
     We don't have all the pieces we need for the
     Lieutenant's plan.

  SHEPPARD
     Right... and which plan would that be again?

  KANAYO
     All will be revealed when the time is right. Oh,
     good.

  SHEPPARD
     I'd hate for things to be revealed too early.


LOCATION--LAB IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gets a tour of Ford's lab from Jace. There
     are primitive computers and various flasks and
     tubes of chemicals.

  MCKAY
     How are you powering these Genii computers?

  JACE
     We stole a Telnorran generator. They're a pain to
     keep serviced, but they do the job. Actually, we
     just got our hands on some Pilation solar cells,
     but I haven't been able to figure out how to
     interface them yet. Have you used them before?

  MCKAY
     Can't say that I have. What--what do you do here?

  JACE
     We study the Wraith.

  MCKAY
     Oh, yeah? How's that going?

  JACE
     Some of our discoveries have been quite exciting,
     actually.

  MCKAY
     Like what?

  JACE
     Well, for one, they seem to be territorial, very
     much so, it turns out. They're not a united foe
     like we once believed.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at an old computer terminal with Wraith
     writing.

  JACE
     Hmm. Really. Yes. In fact, I believe they're
     fracturing even further. Now, my understanding of
     their language is fairly limited, but they seem to
     be trying to establish a system that would
     restrict inter-ship communications.

  MCKAY
     What? Why would they stop sharing information with
     each other?

  JACE
     Ford thinks it might have to do with your friend's
     ability to read their minds. If she taps into
     them, only one ship would be compromised, not the
     whole fleet.

  MCKAY
     All this because of Teyla?

  JACE
     Well, for one, she may not be the only one that
     possesses that ability...

  MCKAY
     Huh. Fair enough.

  JACE
     And two, I think that the lack of food in the
     galaxy has created some deep divisions within the
     Wraith cells.

  MCKAY
     Huh. And you got all that from, uh...this?

  JACE
     Yes. To be honest, I could use some help. How's
     your Wraith, Doctor?

  MCKAY
     (intrigued) It's okay. Let's see what you got.


LOCATION--SPARRING ROOM IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Ford spars with two of his men, beating both
     easily.

  FORD
     That's better. You guys still need to work
     together. You're stronger as a team.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees Ronon has entered.

  FORD
     You want to spar a little?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon just stares at him.

  FORD
     We're cool, right? You're not holding a grudge or
     anything? I did save your life.

  RONON
     I remember.

  FORD
     You know, it's funny. If you asked a dozen people
     who they thought would win in a fight between you
     and me, people would choose you hands down. Hell,
     I'd choose you... But we went toe to toe.

  RONON
     Yeah, we did.

  FORD
     Until Sheppard showed up.

  RONON
     So I guess it's still undecided.

  FORD
     Look, all I'm saying is, why do you think I was
     able to fight you like that? It's the enzyme. Look
     what it did for me. Imagine what it could do for
     you. I'm not the bad guy here, Ronon. I'm just
     trying to help... You'll come around. I know you
     will.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford walks away.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is active. Lorne briefs Weir from the
     planet.

  LORNE
     We just finished our scans, ma'am. They're not
     here.

  WEIR
     Do you think they've headed to another planet?

  LORNE
     It's possible, but as you know it's standard
     procedure to check in and tell us first. They
     didn't do that, so...

  WEIR
     They might have been taken off-world against their
     will.

  LORNE
     Yeah.

  WEIR
     All right. Can you give me the last few addresses
     dialed from that

  DHD?


  LORNE
     Maybe somebody can, but that's a little out of my
     skill set.

  WEIR
     I'll send Zelenka.

  LORNE
     Good call. Lorne out.


LOCATION--FOREST ON PLANET, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Teyla, and Kanayo watch the Genii
     soldiers.

  SHEPPARD
     So, uh, what's the plan?

  KANAYO
     We take them by force.

  SHEPPARD
     That's some groundbreaking strategy there.

  TEYLA
     I think the Colonel is interested in the type of
     attack.

  KANAYO
     We plan to overpower them.

  SHEPPARD
     I think it's best if we just watch.

  KANAYO
     (into comm device) Now.

  ANNOTATION
     Kanayo's men attack, shooting all the Genii with
     stun weapons.

  SHEPPARD
     What kind of plan is that?

  KANAYO
     One that works.

  SHEPPARD
     One of your men got hit.

  KANAYO
     Well, it should be safe for us now.

  ANNOTATION
     The move in. Sheppard checks one of Ford's men.

  SHEPPARD
     This guy's dead.

  TEYLA
     So, you see, you are not invincible.

  KANAYO
     We're close enough.

  TEYLA
     There are skills to the art of war, Kanayo.

  KANAYO
     (insistent) Don't you tell me how to run my
     missions. You're just here to watch.

  ANNOTATION
     One of his men arrives with a metal case. He opens
     it to reveal it's full of C-4.

  KANAYO
     Look familiar?

  SHEPPARD
     That's our C4.

  KANAYO
     We're stealing it back.

  TEYLA
     For what purpose?

  KANAYO
     For the hive.

  SHEPPARD
     As in hive ship?

  KANAYO
     Yeah. That's the Lieutenant's plan. You're going
     to help us destroy a Wraith hive ship.


LOCATION--LAB IN CAVE

  FORD
     One of the added bonuses of killing the Wraith is
     every now and again, you get your hands on a
     couple of these.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up a Wraith comm device.

  FORD
     Now, thanks to Jace and some of the computers that
     we borrowed from the Genii, we've been able to
     figure out the exact flight path of one their hive
     ships.

  JACE
     It's decimating all inhabited worlds in its path.

  FORD
     It has to be stopped.

  JACE
     I've been able to calculate that in the next
     several days, it'll be forced to make a hyperspace
     pause very near an uninhabited planet that happens
     to have a Stargate.

  KANAYO
     We gate to that planet, get on the hive ship,
     plant the C4 in the Dart bay, and get out.

  JACE
     We could save thousands, if not hundreds of
     thousands, of lives.

  FORD
     So?

  SHEPPARD
     Wow.

  FORD
     "Wow"?

  SHEPPARD
     You heard me.

  MCKAY
     Let me see if I can couch what Colonel Sheppard
     means by "wow" in more explicit terms. That is a
     terrible plan.

  TEYLA
     Rodney--

  MCKAY
     Made all the more frightening by the fact that you
     think it's a good plan.

  FORD
     What's wrong with it?

  MCKAY
     (agitated) What's right with it? Look, let's, just
     for a second, give in to reckless abandon and
     assume that it would be possible to plant a single
     charge large enough to destroy an entire hive
     ship.

  JACE
     We're planning on secondary explosions in the Dart
     bay.

  MCKAY
     Regardless, the hive ship will be on a hyperspace
     pause, yes, but it will not enter the planet's
     atmosphere, nor will it take up any sort of stable
     orbit. It will be flying through space, which
     means that unless your enzyme allows you to jump a
     lot higher than you've let on--

  FORD
     We have a spaceship.

  MCKAY
     Oh, yeah? Really. What's that made out of, huh?
     Bark?

  FORD
     No, it's real, McKay. And in fact, it's the only
     ship I'd feel comfortable using on a mission like
     this.


LOCATION--PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team and Ford and his men arrive at a
     meadow. The men uncover a Wraith Dart that's been
     covered with camouflage.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, where'd you get it?

  FORD
     Does it matter?

  KANAYO
     None of us have had much success flying it. We've
     banged it up pretty bad on the last couple of
     landings. It's in need of some repairs.

  FORD
     And a real pilot.

  SHEPPARD
     This is why you brought us here.

  FORD
     It's the reason I waited till now, yes.

  KANAYO
     (indicating McKay) Assuming this guy can get it
     working again.

  FORD
     He can. These people are the best at what they do.

  KANAYO
     (to Sheppard) Look, you fly it, you scoop us up,
     you take us up to the hive, you drop us off. All
     we need is time to lay the charge. We'll be in and
     out of there before the Wraith have any idea
     what's going on.

  FORD
     It's perfect.

  MCKAY
     It is far from perfect.

  SHEPPARD
     But it is possible.

  TEYLA
     (doubtfully) Colonel...

  MCKAY
     Are you honestly considering this?

  SHEPPARD
     It's on its way to a culling, Rodney. Yeah, and I
     am sorry about that, but this is insane.

  SHEPPARD
     Maybe not.

  FORD
     Jace has been trying to get it working but he's
     not you, McKay. Can you fix it?

  MCKAY
     Probably not.

  SHEPPARD
     That usually means "yes."

  MCKAY
     Aren't you the one not taking the enzyme? You're
     supposed to be the clear voice of reason here.

  FORD
     Look, can you fix it?

  MCKAY
     Even if I could, I wouldn't. I'm sorry. Drug me
     all you want. I'm not doing this.

  SHEPPARD
     Let me talk to him. He'll come around.

  FORD
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard follows McKay and catches up with him.
     They walk quickly together.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney...

  MCKAY
     Look, maybe you are on the enzyme. Maybe Ford
     lied, because no rational person would think that
     was a good plan.

  SHEPPARD
     Look, a million things can go wrong. I know that,
     but just-- Lookit, stop! Shut up and listen.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop and face each other, McKay looking
     defiant.

  SHEPPARD
     If you fix that Dart, we all get out of here. I
     know it's risky but Ford's not thinking straight,
     so--

  MCKAY
     What are you talking about?

  SHEPPARD
     I'll insist you're all on the away team. I'll
     scoop you up, and instead of flying out to the
     hive ship, we fly out to Atlantis.

  MCKAY
     How?

  SHEPPARD
     That Dart's got to have its own DHD, right?

  MCKAY
     Of course.

  SHEPPARD
     You get the thing flight-worthy, we all go home.

  MCKAY
     Right. Of course. (becoming abashed) You know, you
     see... I would have thought of that myself before
     I became a drug addict.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm sure you would have.

  MCKAY
     I'm sorry. All right. Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard pats McKay on the back and they turn
     around and start walking back towards Ford.


LOCATION--PLANET, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka works on a DHD while Lorne and his men
     look on.

  ZELENKA
     Speaks Czech.

  LORNE
     That good, huh?

  ZELENKA
     These things are not designed to store 'gate
     addresses.

  LORNE
     What can you give us?

  ZELENKA
     Well, every time the gate is dialed, a slight
     residual imprint is left on the control crystals.

  LORNE
     Which means...

  ZELENKA
     Well, I've managed to mine about fifty addresses
     but I have no idea if they're correct or what
     order they were dialed in.

  LORNE
     Fifty? That's a lot of planets to check.

  ZELENKA
     Yes, and that's assuming that they're correct.

  LORNE
     Okay, so long story short?

  ZELENKA
     It's going to be next to impossible to find
     Colonel Sheppard and his team based on what I can
     get from this DHD.

  LORNE
     Great. Okay, pack it up. Let's take what you got.
     We'll go over it on Atlantis. Weir's not going to
     be happy about this.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to dial out.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford studies a document at his desk. Sheppard
     enters.

  FORD
     How'd that go?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, he'll do it...But, we have need conditions.

  FORD
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Dial back McKay's enzyme doses.

  FORD
     No!

  SHEPPARD
     Look we're under some time constraints here. I'm
     not saying the enzyme wouldn't help. I'm just
     saying we need him standing still and thinking not
     running laps because it feels good.

  FORD
     Ronon and Teyla?

  SHEPPARD
     We stick to the plan there.

  FORD
     Fine. What else?

  SHEPPARD
     I'll fly it, that's obvious, but I want McKay,
     Teyla, and Ronon on the strike team.

  FORD
     It's not a good mission for McKay. Could get rough
     in there.

  SHEPPARD
     Look, if suddenly we need a door open or a
     computer hacked, McKay should be there to do it.
     That's why he's on my team in the first place.

  FORD
     Is that it?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gives him a quick nod. They stand up and
     shake hands.


LOCATION--MEADOW NEAR DART ON PLANET, DAY

     McKay helps one of Ford's men remove the coverings
     from the Dart. Jace holds up a box.

  MCKAY
     No.

     schematics with Sheppard.

  FORD
     So that's...

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, no. You fire it up now, it'll all go
     up in smoke.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford rolls up the schematic. Sheppard sits.

  SHEPPARD
     It's a good plan.

  FORD
     Couldn't have done it without you, sir.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I'm glad you trusted me enough to bring me
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford looks troubled.

  SHEPPARD
     What's wrong?

  FORD
     I want to go home.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stands and approaches Ford.

  SHEPPARD
     Well...then let's go. Give McKay the DHD crystals,
     and let's get out of here. I can have you back on
     Earth within an hour.

  FORD
     No. We have to do this first. I have to prove to
     them that we can do this.

  SHEPPARD
     You don't have to prove anything to anyone,
     Lieutenant. I saw your cousin and your
     grandparents while I was back there. They miss
     you...a lot. This whole M.I.A. thing is killing
     them.

  FORD
     They're strong. They can wait. If anyone's ever
     going to take me seriously ever again, we have to
     do this.

  SHEPPARD
     Listen, Aiden--

  FORD
     No. I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about this.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard talks to Teyla and Ronon, who are eating.

  SHEPPARD
     Well... part of me thinks he brought us here
     'cause he knew we'd bring him back. I think
     subconsciously he knows what our plan is, and he's
     fine with it.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teyla aren't listening. They are making
     aggressive expressions to each other across the
     table. Ronon stands and steals part of Teyla's
     food with a challenging smile.

  TEYLA
     Give it back.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon puts the food in his mouth and chews.

  RONON
     Or what?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla slugs him in the face, smiling.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon grabs Teyla and pulls her across the table
     onto the floor. Sheppard is shocked. The two start
     slugging each other and sparring. Sheppard
     approaches.

  SHEPPARD
     Knock it off, guys. Stop--

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon accidentally elbows Sheppard in the face,
     knocking him down. They stop fighting.

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell's gotten into you two? Oh, right.
     Never mind.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gets off the floor and sits down
     painfully.

  RONON
     Are we going to talk about this?

  SHEPPARD
     About what?

  RONON
     The enzyme works. No one's saying it, but we're
     all thinking it. It works.

  TEYLA
     I must admit, I have noticed an increased amount
     of strength.

  ANNOTATION
     She smiles and moves as if full of energy.

  RONON
     Maybe Ford is right. Maybe it's worth looking
     into, seeing what this stuff can do.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is clearly dubious.

  TEYLA
     They were an hour late delivering our doses
     yesterday, and I felt awful. It frightens me how
     reliant my body has become on the enzyme always
     being in my system. What would happen if we
     suddenly could not receive it?

  RONON
     If the only negative is that you've got to keep
     taking it, I'd want to stay on it.

  SHEPPARD
     What about you?

  TEYLA
     The fact that I'm even considering it makes me
     feel--

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters.

  MCKAY
     Hey.

  SHEPPARD
     So?

  MCKAY
     It's ready.


LOCATION--MEADOW NEAR DART

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sits in the Dart's cockpit. Jace is
     beside him. McKay climbs up.

  MCKAY
     Okay, now... (to Jace) Could you move? Look, this
     is probably going to make you a little uneasy, but
     when the canopy forms, it's perfectly opaque.

  SHEPPARD
     Then how am I going to fly this thing?

  MCKAY
     The whole thing is one giant heads-up display.
     It'll show you all the pertinent information that
     you need.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, you mean in Wraith.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, which is why I've installed an interface to
     translate a lot of the readouts.

  SHEPPARD
     By "a lot" do you mean "all"? Because my Wraith's
     not all that good.

  MCKAY
     Enough to get you by.

  FORD
     (to McKay) I knew you could do it. Right on time.
     Kanayo will get you suited up. You should get
     ready.

  MCKAY
     Right. Great.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gives Sheppard a nervous look, then climbs
     down and walks over to one of Ford's men, who
     drops his vest on purpose.

  FORD
     He seems a little nervous.

  SHEPPARD
     You know McKay. He'll be fine.

  FORD
     You know how to dial the DHD on this thing?

  SHEPPARD
     Got the addresses memorized.

  FORD
     Good. Good. Listen, I should probably tell
     you...there's been a slight change of plans.

  SHEPPARD
     (unconcerned) Oh, yeah?

  FORD
     Kanayo!

  ANNOTATION
     Kanayo and the others point their weapons at
     McKay. Ronon pulls out his weapon, but Ford's men
     aim at him as well.

  KANAYO
     Don't even think about it!

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you doing?

  FORD
     McKay's going to stay here while we do the op.
     Take him!

  ANNOTATION
     Some of Ford's men force McKay to leave.

  MCKAY
     What? No! No, no, no, no, no!

  SHEPPARD
     That wasn't part of the plan.

  FORD
     Neither was you heading back to Atlantis. You
     didn't really buy the whole "I want to go home"
     speech, did you? Huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard appears disappointed he fell for it.
     Kanayo takes Ronon's blade weapon from him.

  FORD
     You're always underestimating me, Sheppard. You
     need to stop doing that. Complete the mission, and
     McKay lives.

  SHEPPARD
     We can't complete the mission, Ford. It's a bad
     plan!

  FORD
     You said it was a great plan.

  SHEPPARD
     You didn't buy the whole "it's a great plan"
     speech, did you?

  FORD
     Get this Dart in the air and come scoop us up.
     Oh... and the Dart DHD only dials to the planet
     we're going to and back here, just in case McKay's
     life isn't enough to get you to do the right
     thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford steps away from the Dart.

  TEYLA
     Aiden...what are you doing?

  FORD
     Just making sure you guys hold up your end of the
     bargain. (to his men) It's okay. Give them back
     their weapons.

  KANAYO
     Are you sure?

  FORD
     Yeah. If we're going to do this, we've all got to
     work together.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps over and hands Sheppard his pistol.

  FORD
     Good luck to us all.

  ANNOTATION
     Jace holds his weapon on Sheppard while he powers
     up the Dart.

  SHEPPARD

  LORNE
     And I know that, but I need you to understand that
     it is going to take a very long time to search all
     the planets on our list. It...it could take

  MCKAY
     (nervous and frantic) Yeah, pretty sure. Look,
     don't you think that they should be back by now? I
     mean, how long does it take to fly there and fly
     back, you know? I mean, I say it's a minute from
     here to the gate, 10 tops from their gate to the
     hive ship, 20 to get in and lay a charge, and,
     what, like 10 more to get back out and home,
     right? So...

  BOUNCER
     Worrying really isn't going to do anything.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, I subscribe to a different school of
     thought.

  BOUNCER
     They're fine.

  MCKAY
     You can't possibly know that.

  BOUNCER
     I got a gut feeling.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, I have a different gut...

  ANNOTATION
     The guards approach him menacingly.

  MCKAY
     ...feeling.

     believe we can streamline our power consumption a
     further thirty percent... Also, at the time of

     Are you all right?

  TEYLA
     Yes.

  SHEPPARD
     On a hive ship.

  TEYLA
     Uh-huh.

  SHEPPARD
     (sitting up) Well, then, no, I'm not doing so
     good.

  FORD
     I can't believe you screwed up.

  SHEPPARD
     (standing) I did what?

  FORD
     You set off the alarm. You ruined the mission.

  SHEPPARD
     The Dart went on autopilot the second I got close
     to the hive. You're lucky I was able to get you
     out!

  FORD
     Well, why would it do that? Why would it go on
     autopilot?

  SHEPPARD
     That's what Jumpers do when they gate to Atlantis.

  FORD
     Well, why didn't you say something?

  SHEPPARD
     (incredulous) Why didn't I say something?

  FORD
     You want me to fail. You want me to look bad.

  SHEPPARD
     (angry) That's right, you snot-nosed brat. I'd put
     my team's life on the line just to prove you
     wrong.
