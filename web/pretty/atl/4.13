  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard watches the applause for the ending of a
     computer golf game on one console as McKay fidgets
     and grooms himself nearby.

  SHEPPARD
     Come on, dude, one more round.

  MCKAY
     Nope, I can't.

  SHEPPARD
     We don't have to do eighteen. We can do nine, easy
     course, par three.

  MCKAY
     Nope, Katie's expecting me.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, be late. Women like it when guys are late.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stops his grooming and walks over, looking
     pleased.

  MCKAY
     No, they don't. And I can't be late--not for this
     lunch.

  SHEPPARD
     Why's that?

  MCKAY
     Can you keep a secret?

  SHEPPARD
     No.

  MCKAY
     (not listening) Right. I, uh, I got this...on my
     last trip to Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows Sheppard a ring, still in its box. It is
     a very small diamond embedded in a plain silver or
     platinum band.

  MCKAY
     I feel it's time that, uh, Katie and I moved the
     relationship to the next level.

  SHEPPARD
     Second base?

  MCKAY
     No. Marriage.

  SHEPPARD
     (shocked) Really?

  MCKAY
     Yes.

  SHEPPARD
     (incredulous) You?

  MCKAY
     Yes.

  SHEPPARD
     Married?

  MCKAY
     What, you don't think I'm ready? You think I'm-I'm
     rushing things?

  SHEPPARD
     I didn't say that...!

  MCKAY
     Well-well, I'm not. I'm not ready to set a date or
     anything, but, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard studies the ring closer, noticing the
     tiny stone.

  SHEPPARD
     Is this a diamond?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, eighth of a carat, actually. Conflict-free
     and um, I got a good deal, actually.

  SHEPPARD
     (drily) I'm sure you did.

  MCKAY
     All right...so...here I go...

  ANNOTATION
     He takes off his radio headset and lays it on the
     table.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I-I'll buy you a beer later. We can
     celebrate...

  MCKAY
     Yeah, or, uh, drown my sorrows should she say no.

  SHEPPARD
     (bracingly) No, no, none of that.

  MCKAY
     Right.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, go get the girl!

  MCKAY
     Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay heads out, meeting Teyla on her way in.
     Teyla's pregnancy is obviously showing.

  TEYLA
     Rodn--

  MCKAY
     Can't talk.

  ANNOTATION
     He hurries out.

  TEYLA
     John...do you have a moment to talk?


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Keller spots Ronon entering with a bloodied arm.

  KELLER
     Another sparring accident?

  RONON
     Actually, I slipped in the shower.

  KELLER
     Oh, really?

  RONON
     Nah. Sparring accident.

  KELLER
     This is the third time this week I've had to patch
     you up.

  RONON
     Mmm.

  KELLER
     You know, there are a lot of other ways you can
     spend your free time.

  RONON
     Not as much fun, though.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakes her head as she puts on rubber
     gloves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka and Carter meet outside an elevator
     transporter.

  ZELENKA
     Hi, Colonel.

  CARTER
     Doctor! Where you headed?

  ZELENKA
     Control room.

  CARTER
     Oh, me too. We can share.

  ZELENKA
     Splendid.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, and they wait for it to empty
     before entering.


LOCATION--BOTANY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay wanders through the outer lab.

  MCKAY
     Katie?

  KATIE
     I'm in here!

  ANNOTATION
     He finds her in an inner part of the lab.

  MCKAY
     Great! Awesome! I hope you're hungry.

  KATIE
     Oh, I am.

  MCKAY
     (nervously) Yeah, me too. Very hungry. Hungry,
     hungry, hungry.

  KATIE
     (chuckling) Are you all right?

  MCKAY
     I'm...fine. Uh...yeah... Wow, this is much more,
     uh...

  ANNOTATION
     Katie comes closer. McKay is swaying, shifting
     nervously.

  KATIE
     You're sweating.

  MCKAY
     (wiping his brow) Oh, am I? I suppose I am. Okay,
     um, I guess I-I should, uh, jump right into this.
     You know, rip the band-aid off, as they
     say...not-not that this is painful in any way.
     It's quite the opposite, actually.

  KATIE
     (laughing) Rodney, what's wrong?

  MCKAY
     It's nothing. In-in fact, everything's
     right...with us, I mean. So, I-I was thinking...I
     don't know about you, but-but the way I see it,
     um, I thought that, uh, maybe...it's time that
     we...you know...start entertaining the notion...

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches into his pocket for the ring box.
     Suddenly klaxons blare and the door to the outer
     lab seals shut.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     As Keller treats Ronon's arm, the doors seal shut,
     closing them off from other areas of the
     infirmary.


LOCATION--SCIENCE LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Two scientists look up as their door seals them
     into the lab.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel look alarmed as the doors everywhere
     close.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     A heavy door lowers, sealing Teyla and Sheppard
     inside the lab.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Katie hurry to the door, the former
     trying the controls. The doors remain shut.

  KATIE
     What happened? Why'd the doors close?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tries to pry open the doors. Katie helps, to
     no effect.

  KATIE
     (concerned) Rodney, what's going on?

  MCKAY
     (worried) It's locked. We're trapped.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Sheppard try and open a side door, to no
     avail.

  TEYLA
     We are locked in.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Rodney, come in!


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Keller tries one door as Ronon struggles with
     another one.

  KELLER
     This one's locked, too.

  RONON
     What the hell is going on here?

  KELLER
     (into radio) Doctor McKay, this is Doctor Keller.
     Are you there?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka checks the door controls while Carter
     studies the back control panel and keys her radio.

  CARTER
     (into radio) Rodney, this is Sam, do you read?

  ZELENKA
     (closing the panel) The control mechanism is not
     responding. Perhaps I can physically open the
     door.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves to help him try and pry open the
     door.

  ZELENKA
     Transporter doors are lighter; they're not nearly
     as heavy as other doors in the city.

  ANNOTATION
     They both grunt as they use brute force to no
     effect.

  ZELENKA
     Curses in Czech.

  CARTER
     (into radio) Rodney, this is Sam, please respond.

  ANNOTATION
     There is only open static on the radio.

  CARTER
     (into radio) Colonel Sheppard, do you read? (to
     Zelenka) Are you getting anything?

  ZELENKA
     No. Communications must be down.

  CARTER
     Oh, great.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB

  MCKAY
     (snapping his fingers) All right, I'm gonna need a
     radio. I left mine in the lab.

  KATIE
     Uh, radio? It's in there.

  ANNOTATION
     She points to the door they're trying to open.

  MCKAY
     What do you mean? What, you don't have a radio in
     here?

  KATIE
     It's a plant cultivation room. We haven't needed
     one.

  MCKAY
     Well, you need one now! Look, that alarm was a
     quarantine lockdown!

  KATIE
     Quarantine?

  MCKAY
     Atlantis's, uh, self-protection against another
     outbreak. It's sealing off sections of the city to
     prevent the spread of a disease. I, uh, tweaked
     the, uh, system after the recent Kirsan fever
     outbreak.

  KATIE
     But...there was no lockdown during that outbreak.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay paces nervously, looking around.

  MCKAY
     Well, hence the need to tweak the system, you
     know? Institute more vigorous protocols. Okay, I
     need to get to a computer, assess the degree of
     the situation. I mean, is this just a few sections
     that have been sealed off, or, uh, maybe the whole
     tower...? Computer's in the other room, isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     Katie nods.

  MCKAY
     With the radio...

  ANNOTATION
     Katie shrugs.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon tries to pry open the door to no avail.

  KELLER
     there must be another disease outbreak. McKay said
     he was going to modify the quarantine system to
     make it more efficient.

  RONON
     How does cutting off the radios make it more
     efficient?

  KELLER
     Obviously, there's a glitch in the program.
     Problem is, without communications, he can't tell
     me how bad the outbreak is or give me the
     pass-codes to open whichever doors are deemed
     safe.

  RONON
     (sarcastic) Ah, great.

  KELLER
     Well, in any case, I should be ready to treat the
     sick when they bring them in. Will you help me?

  RONON
     Tell me what to do.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard studies the sealed door.

  SHEPPARD
     I could really use Ronon's gun right about now.

  TEYLA
     John, look.

  ANNOTATION
     He comes back over to the computers.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  TEYLA
     It appears there's been another outbreak.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard pulls up a schematic of the base and
     read-outs on the main screen, deleting the "golf
     program" still there.

  TEYLA
     What is a..."category five?"

  SHEPPARD
     I'm guessing it's a lot worse than categories one
     through four. We could be here a while.

  ANNOTATION
     He glances nervously at Teyla's protruding
     abdomen. Teyla catches his glance.

  TEYLA
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     It's just that every time one of these things
     happens in the movies, the pregnant woman goes
     into labor.

  TEYLA
     I'm still a long way from my due date.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, it's the same thing in the movies, and then
     "wham."

  TEYLA
     Relax, John. I will be fine.

  SHEPPARD
     Why don't you sit down?

  TEYLA
     I'm all right.

  SHEPPARD
     Y-y-you know, just to be on the safe side, let's
     sit down.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rolls over a stool. Teyla humors him,
     sighing.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's see what else we can find out.

  ANNOTATION
     He continues typing into the computer.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Zelenka both heave heavy sighs.

  CARTER
     Quarantine lockdown.

  ZELENKA
     Yes.

  CARTER
     Well, I don't know why communications would be
     affected.

  ZELENKA
     Well, Rodney did say he was going to modify some
     of the Ancient protocols. Perhaps he made a
     mistake--made the, uh, security measures a little
     too aggressive?

  CARTER
     We need to try to access the mainframe.

  ANNOTATION
     She picks up Zelenka's computer from the floor.

  ZELENKA
     Yes, but unfortunately, that's all you'll be able
     to do. This tablet has limited RAM. It's
     configured mainly for read-only field diagnostics.

  CARTER
     Well, we should at least be able to determine the
     extent of the lockdown.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns the computer on. The screen instantly
     shows a picture of a pigeon.

  ZELENKA
     Yes, oh sorry. That-that's one of my pigeons.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes the computer and shuts off the image of
     the pigeon. Carter studies him.

  ZELENKA
     I-I raise them...as a hobby...back home?

  CARTER
     Ah.

  ZELENKA
     Let's see what we have here.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  SHEPPARD
     You comfortable? You want anything? You want to
     lie down? Eat?

  TEYLA
     This is what I wanted to talk to you about.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  TEYLA
     Your decision to remove me from the team's
     missions.

  SHEPPARD
     We're not going to go through this again, are we?

  TEYLA
     No, no, no. It-it's all right. I-I understand.

  SHEPPARD
     It's not permanent. You-you're just going to have
     to ease off, then you have your baby, and...in a
     few months, you're back in action.

  TEYLA
     Will I be? If it is wrong to place myself and my
     unborn child in danger now, will it be any less to
     do so when he is born? John, it's bad enough that
     my son may grow up without a father, but if I were
     to be hurt...or killed? He would be left without a
     mother as well.

  SHEPPARD
     It's tough, I know. I got a friend from college,
     she's a cop, three kids. She goes through this
     every day when she goes to work.

  TEYLA
     How does she make peace with herself?

  SHEPPARD
     Well...she figures, she's fighting bad guys,
     keeping them off the streets, so not only is she
     protecting her kids, she's protecting other kids,
     too.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla sighs.

  SHEPPARD
     Look...you have to understand...your child has a
     family here, in case anything ever happens.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla replies with a wan smile.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka and Carter pour over the readout.

  ZELENKA
     Category five?

  CARTER
     The entire city?! Either this disease spreads more
     rapidly than anything I've ever encountered
     before, or...

  CARTER AND ZELENKA
     Something's wrong.

  ZELENKA
     (continuing) Yeah, look at the levels.
     Primary...secondary systems...Look, wild
     fluctuations in every sector.

  CARTER
     Other systems are down too, not just
     communications. Long-range scanners are out.
     Ventilation in several areas, including this
     tower.

  ZELENKA
     Oh, oh, and plumbing too! Oh, dear.

  CARTER
     It's like the city's entire operating system is on
     the fritz. Oh, this may not even be a lockdown at
     all. This entire lockdown could be the result of a
     malfunction. Don't worry, I'm sure McKay is
     sitting at a workstation fixing this problem as we
     speak.


LOCATION--BOTANY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Katie and McKay stand helplessly by a plant table.

  KATIE
     I'm sure others are working on the problem. Doctor
     Keller, Doctor Zelenka...Colonel Carter...

  MCKAY
     (sighing) Oh they better be.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon tries to use an i.v. pole to pry open the
     doors. It snaps in his arms. Keller races over
     from another section.

  KELLER
     Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey.

  ANNOTATION
     She studies his injury. The wound is bleeding
     heavily through the bandage.

  KELLER
     (scolding) You tore your stitches! Gah, honestly,
     I don't think I've met anyone with such reckless
     aggression.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller leads him over to the beds and goes to get
     some supplies. Ronon smirks at her.

  KELLER
     That's not a compliment.

  RONON
     If you say so.

  KELLER
     Lay [sic] down.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon does so. Keller puts on gloves to treat the
     wound.

  KELLER
     Okay, look, I don't think we're going to have any
     luck opening those doors on our own. We're
     probably just better off waiting for McKay and the
     others to...figure out what needs to be done
     and-and which doors are even safe to be open.

  RONON
     So we're just supposed to sit here and wait?

  KELLER
     Yes! And...be ready at a moment's notice
     to...treat the sick.

  RONON
     (smiling) I'm not very good at sitting and
     waiting.

  KELLER
     (scoffing) No kidding. Well, maybe we could pass
     the time by...getting to know each other better.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon studies her.

  RONON
     What do you have in mind?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller stops treating his wound as she realizes
     Ronon's supine position. Her eyes widen.

  KELLER
     (flustered) Oh! I-I mean, I didn't...you know, I
     meant, just, like...talk. I didn't mean...

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon gives a wry smile and nods.

  KELLER
     (still flustered) Yeah, so, anyway, um...let's
     talk.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks around blankly. Keller gives a pained
     smile.


LOCATION--BOTONY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Katie attempts to try and pull off the door panel.

  KATIE
     Can't you fiddle with this and get the door open?

  MCKAY
     I could "fiddle with it", sure. As to actually
     getting the door open? Not a chance. The
     quarantine protocol completely disables the door's
     control mechanisms. The whole point of it is to
     keep people from getting out.

  KATIE
     Oh, it's going to be okay. Doctor Keller and
     Zelenka have--

  MCKAY
     (panicking) We don't know that! We have no idea if
     it's going to be okay. For all we know, Zelenka
     and Keller could already be infected! We don't
     even know how much of the city is in quarantine!
     If this is serious, and we have no reason to
     believe otherwise, we could be looking at a
     city-wide lockdown.

  KATIE
     (crossing her arms) You are thinking the worst
     case scenario.

  MCKAY
     Hello? This is what I do! Someone needs to think
     ahead to the worst possible outcome to any
     situation in order to properly defend against it.

  KATIE
     Any situation? Even the good ones?

  MCKAY
     Hey, it doesn't take much for a-a good situation
     to-to turn ugly. One minute you're happily riding
     your bicycle back from acing your Lagrangian
     Mechanics midterm, you know, the warm breeze in
     your face, next thing you know, you're flying
     through the air 'cause you just hit a pothole.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie lowers her arms and walks closer.

  KATIE
     (sympathetically) Aw, Rodney, did that happen to
     you?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay paces, walking past Katie's attempted
     embrace without noticing. She looks nonplussed as
     she ends up just brushing his arm.

  MCKAY
     The point is, one must always be on guard, you
     know? Always looking out for the potholes. Now,
     you can-you can call me a catastrophist, but it's
     a...necessary burden I bear.

  KATIE
     A mindset like that, and a person would live in a
     constant fate of worry and fear.

  MCKAY
     (despondently) You forgot despair.

  ANNOTATION
     He sighs.


LOCATION--TRANSPORTER

  ZELENKA
     Well, it's definitely a malfunction, and
     surprisingly, it's nothing Rodney did. Look at
     that, I'm reading a sudden spike in power caused
     by an intense ionospheric storm earlier today.
     This new planet continues to surprise us. It is
     going to require some drastic recalibration to
     account for any future ionospheric activity,
     that's for sure.

  CARTER
     Well, first things first. We need to get to a
     workstation and fix this malfunction.

  ZELENKA
     (sighing) Yes, I agree. You know, I'm a little bit
     puzzled as to why Rodney hasn't solved this
     problem yet. He's been a little bit off his game
     lately.

  CARTER
     Maybe he doesn't have access to a computer.

  ZELENKA
     (incredulous) Rodney? Without his computer? This I
     have yet to witness.

  CARTER
     Well, whatever the cause, since there's no
     outbreak, there's no reason for us to be stuck in
     here.

  ZELENKA
     Well, yes--other than the doors being sealed
     shut...and heavier than we had previously thought.

  CARTER
     Can you use this tablet to access this control
     panel? Maybe we can at least figure out a way to
     get the doors open.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter opens the panel Zelenka worked on earlier
     and studies it.

  ZELENKA
     Doubtful. The transporter panel has no wireless
     interface. And even if we could hook it up
     directly, you know, with the limitations of the
     RAM on this tablet--

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs the computer out of Zelenka's hand.

  CARTER
     May I? Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Not waiting for a response, she plugs the computer
     into the panel with a cord attached to the system.

  ZELENKA
     (quietly) Yes, of course.

  TEYLA
     Well, life signs all over the city. Everyone is
     trapped as we are.

  SHEPPARD
     Ventilation's down, which means we're running out
     of air.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard happens to notice McKay's headset on the
     table.

  SHEPPARD
     He's in the botany lab!

  TEYLA
     Who?

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney. He-he went to pick up Katie Brown for a
     lunch date. Ha-have you been in that plant room?
     There's no computers, no radio...

  TEYLA
     If he's locked in there...

  SHEPPARD
     He's going to be freaking.

     McKay tries to use a trowel to pry open the door
     to no effect.

  MCKAY
     (groaning) Ohhh.

  ANNOTATION
     He crouches weakly.

  KATIE
     (sympathetic) Oh, are you all right?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. I feel a little dizzy...a little
     feverish.

  KATIE
     H-here. Rodney, come on. Sit down.

  ANNOTATION
     She carries a stool over. He collapses into the
     chair with an air of malaise. She feels his
     forehead.

  KATIE
     Hmm. You don't feel warm.

  MCKAY
     Are you sure? 'Cause, uh, oh...my joints ache.

  MCKAY
     (brightening) That's normal.

  KATIE
     Oh.

  MCKAY
     I've always had a rapid heartbeat. Eh, ever since
     I was a kid. I mean, even when I was in a deep
     sleep, our-our-our family doctor once wrote a
     paper about it.

  KATIE
     Oh.

  MCKAY
     (worried) How are you feeling?

  KATIE
     (taken aback) I'm fine.

     Okay, well you let me know when you start feeling
     sick, all right?

     It seems there was some sort of disturbance in the
     planet's ionosphere a few hours ago. After that is
     when the system became unstable.

  SHEPPARD
     New planet, new problems.

  TEYLA
     Well, there may not even be a disease outbreak.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but the city's still on lockdown. You know,
     if Rodney can't get a hold of a computer, he's not
     going to be able to shut it down.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps Doctor Zelenka or Colonel Carter can do
     it.

  SHEPPARD
     Eh, if they could've, they would've done it
     already. They probably can't get a hold of one,
     either.

  TEYLA
     Well, can anyone do it?

  SHEPPARD
     (shaking his head) They'd have to know Rodney's
     password. Fortunately...I do.

  TEYLA
     (surprised) He told you his password?!

  SHEPPARD
     See? It doesn't take a genius.

  TEYLA
     It-it doesn't?

  SHEPPARD
     1643 is the year Isaac Newton was born; 1879,
     Einstein. And 1968...

  TEYLA
     (nodding) The year Rodney was born.

  MCKAY
     Never underestimate the size of that man's ego.

  TEYLA
     Wait. Weren't there other numbers?

  SHEPPARD


  42.


  TEYLA
     And what is that?

  SHEPPARD
     It's the ultimate answer to the great question of
     life, the universe, and everything.

     She sets down the computer to take off her own
     jacket and push up her sleeves. Zelenka notices
     Carter's cleavage, then immediately tries to avert
     his eyes. Carter doesn't notice.

  CARTER
     Okay, much better.

  ZELENKA
     Yes...much better.

  CARTER
     The control panel won't recognize authentication.

  ZELENKA
     That's because it's not configured. As I said
     earlier--

  CARTER
     I know. Which is why I've written a work around to
     free up memory to allow for local device input.

  ZELENKA
     (impressed) Oh! So fast?

  CARTER
     Well, there's obviously not enough RAM to handle
     the city's entire operating system, but we should
     at least be able to open these doors. All I need
     to do is get it to recognize the authentication
     command.

  ZELENKA
     Perhaps if you bypassed the secondary crystals and
     go directly to the--

  ZELENKA
     Ah.

     Oh, crap.

  TEYLA
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     She stands and comes over.

  SHEPPARD
     Part of the, uh, lockdown program includes
     broadcasting an alert beacon to, uh, approaching
     ships to warn them about a disease outbreak.

  TEYLA
     The city is doing this right now?

  SHEPPARD
     Five by five. Clear enough for the entire
     neighborhood to pick up.

  TEYLA
     (sighing) Can you shut it off?

  SHEPPARD
     Not from here. It can only be turned off from the
     subspace transmitter, which is up in the control
     room, which means the guys upstairs either haven't
     noticed it, or, more likely, they don't have
     Rodney's password to turn it off.

  TEYLA
     As long as that signal is broadcast, Atlantis is
     vulnerable to discovery.

     If it hasn't already happened.

  KATIE
     As a matter of fact, I could.

     McKay nods and takes a deep breath, wanting to
     speak, but nervousness overtakes him and he can't

     tufts on the tip.

  MCKAY
     (lamely) Right. Right. It's grown.

  KATIE
     Yes, it's really flourished here. I've-I've been
     kind of doting on it, giving it a little extra
     TLC, and it-it just gets bigger and bigger.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts having a choking cough. Katie hurries
     to his side. He recovers instantly now that the
     conversation isn't involving their relationship.

  KATIE
     (worried) We need to get you to the infirmary!

  MCKAY
     I already told you, it's impossible. Look, the
     whole point of the lockdown is to prevent the
     spread of disease, which means no one's going
     anywhere.

  KATIE
     But how are the doctors supposed to treat anyone
     if they can't reach them?

  MCKAY
     I'm sorry, Katie. Look, I've no doubt infected you
     by now.

  KATIE
     But I feel fine. You'd think I'd have at least a
     few symptoms.

  MCKAY
     Every disease is different. I mean, we have no
     idea what the incubation period for the strain is.
     It could be hours; it could be days. I mean, who
     knows when I caught it! No, it's just a matter of
     time before you succumb too.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie's face falls.

  MCKAY
     Anyway...what were we talking about?

     who, um, need me.

  RONON
     You're not letting them down.

  KELLER
     There's a disease outbreak. And I'm a doctor,
     stuck in this room--

     That's right. Stuck. It's not your fault you can't
     get to them, so don't put the blame on yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller gives a weak smile and nods. Ronon smiles.

  RONON
     You remind me of someone I used to know. She put
     way too much pressure on herself.

  KELLER
     Someone from Sateda?

  RONON
     (contemplative) Yeah...

  KELLER
     Who was she?

  RONON
     She-she was someone I cared about. (clearing his
     throat) She was killed during the siege.

  KELLER

  RONON
     I-I wanted her to leave. But she chose to stay
     behind and help the others. (coughs, and smiles
     self-consciously) Should've forced her to go.

     Whoa, whoa, whoa. But you said earlier that there
     was no outbreak.

  SHEPPARD
     No, there isn't. But the city doesn't know that.

  BANKS
     It's all part of the system-wide malfunction. The
     city must think there's a disease, and now it's
     out of control.

  CHUCK
     So blowing up Atlantis is its final
     counter-measure.

  SHEPPARD
     Did you see how much time was left on the
     self-destruct?

  CHUCK
     No. Computers shut down before I could see.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. If we can't shut it down from here,
     we're gonna have to turn it off at the source.

  BANKS
     That's in the main power room.

  CHUCK
     That's six levels down.

  LORNE
     We can't get there. Jumper room's sealed off, as
     well as every other corridor out of the gate room.

  SHEPPARD
     I'll just have to climb back down.

  BANKS
     The power room's in the center of the tower. Even
     if you climbed back down, you'd still have to get
     through several sealed doors before reaching it.

  SHEPPARD

  LORNE

     heard by Sheppard's group.

  LORNE
     You hear that?

  SHEPPARD
     The transporter. Somebody's in there.

  ANNOTATION
     They jog to the transporter doors.

  SHEPPARD
     Grab a side.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Lorne force the doors open. Zelenka
     and Carter help. As soon as there's enough of an
     opening, Zelenka jumps out, gasping for air.
     Carter follows, breathing deeply.

  SHEPPARD
     Colonel. You all right?

  CARTER
     Yeah, I'm fine.

  ZELENKA
     (insulted) I'm fine, too.

  SHEPPARD
     There's no outbreak. It's just a malfunction.

  CARTER
     We know. Was Rodney the one who finally disabled
     the self-destruct?

  SHEPPARD
     No, it's still armed, and I haven't heard from
     Rodney.

  CARTER
     I need to get to a workstation.

  CHUCK
     Computers are down.

  LORNE
     We're trying to get to the main power room, so we
     can physically cut the power to the self-destruct.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  SHEPPARD
     But all the doors are sealed shut. We just used
     the last of our C-4 getting here.

  ZELENKA
     (disappointed) Does that mean we're still stuck
     here?

  SHEPPARD
     (nodding) That's what it looks like.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka sighs.

  CARTER
     How much time is left on the self-destruct?

  BANKS
     We don't know. Computers shut down before we could
     see.

  CARTER
     So it could happen any time.

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck nods. Carter exchanges concerned looks with
     Sheppard.

  CARTER
     (sarcastic) Great.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie paces the room, looking at the ring. McKay
     still lies on the floor.

  KATIE
     (smiling, amazed) You were going to propose to me?
     Today?

  MCKAY
     Well, I mean, before the--before the lockdown.

  KATIE
     So...? Why don't you?

  MCKAY
     Now? You want me to propose now?

  KATIE
     (smiling) Don't you want to hear my answer?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay lies back,.

  MCKAY
     Well, it doesn't really matter anymore, does it?

  KATIE
     (stunned) How can you say that?

  MCKAY
     Oh, I don't know. Maybe because we're moments away
     from our deaths?

  KATIE
     Don't talk like that! There's still a chance
     someone could come through this door--

  MCKAY
     Katie, please. Enough already. As much as I'd love
     to believe that someone's going to swoop in and
     save the day, the fact that no one has tells me
     it's probably not going to happen. I'm sorry if
     that's bleak and-and-horrible and fatalistic, but
     there it is.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie stares at the door, her expression one of
     sadness and disappointment.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Lorne try a door to no avail.

  ZELENKA
     What are we going to do now?

  LORNE
     What can we do?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stands on a bench, looking at an air vent
     near the ceiling.

  SHEPPARD
     Does this vent go to the power room?

  ZELENKA
     Yes! Yes, I believe at least to the tower's main
     ventilation flue.

  CARTER
     Well, that system's shut down. Those vents will be
     closed off.

  BANKS
     Not anymore. We were able to get it back online in
     most of the tower just before the computers went
     down.

  ANNOTATION
     Shepaprd pries open the grate. He reaches back and
     Lorne hands him a flashlight. Sheppard peers
     inside.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, it looks clear. It's going to be a
     tight squeeze, though. There's no way I can move
     in here.

  CARTER
     I'll do it.

  ZELENKA
     No. I'll do it.

  CARTER
     Are you sure?

  ZELENKA
     (determined) Yes. I'm small enough. I can crawl
     through there. I'll have the power off in no time.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods and taps him on the arm.

  CARTER
     (conceding) All right.

  SHEPPARD
     Attaboy.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard climbs down from the chair. Zelenka takes
     his place. Preparing himself and sticking the
     flashlight in his mouth, he looks back at
     everyone.

  LORNE
     Ready?

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka nods.

  LORNE
     Ooop!

  ANNOTATION
     He and Sheppard shove Zelenka into the ventilation
     shaft, where he begins to crawl.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Keller sit on the floor, leaning against
     the footboard of an infirmary bed.

  RONON
     I had you wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller looks over.

  RONON
     When you first came here... I thought you were
     weak. That you didn't belong.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller rolls her eyes.

  KELLER
     That's the story of my life. Growing up, I skipped
     three grades. I graduated at fifteen. Got my
     bachelor's degree before I was even old enough to
     vote. I missed out on a lot of things. Any kind of
     social event. You know, parties. And dances...I
     don't ever remember a time in my life where I
     belonged.

  RONON
     Yeah, well...blowing up that tank...you really
     showed yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller smiles self-deprecatingly.

  KELLER
     But it didn't work.

  RONON
     That's not the point.

  ANNOTATION
     They stare at each other.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS VENTILATION SHAFTS

  ZELENKA
     "I'll have the power off in no time." muttering in
     Czech Idiot! more muttering in Czech.

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches a cross-section of vents with a deep
     hole straight down. Zelenka looks around, then
     pushes himself to the "downward" vent. He flips
     himself around to slide down.

  ZELENKA
     Aah.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon shifts closer to Keller, who rests her head
     on his shoulder comfortably.

     McKay, who still lies flat on the floor, waiting
     for death.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Lorne, and Carter watch the ventilation

     Come on, Radek.

  CARTER
     (confidently) He'll make it.

     Ronon leans his head closer. Keller looks up at
     him and smiles.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS POWER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Beeps and a timed alarm buzzes as Zelenka falls
     through the ceiling vent and lands on the floor.

  ZELENKA
     Ah! Oooh!

  ANNOTATION
     He stumbles to his feet, shaking his right hand,
     and hurries over to the wall, where he starts
     powering down several huge circuit breakers near
     the naquadah reactors.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Keller lean in to kiss. The lights go
     off, distracting them.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka continues to shut down the last of the
     circuit breakers, shaking his right hand still.

  CARTER
     (smiling) He did it.

     Everyone exchanges relieved looks.

     Zelenka resets the circuits, restoring power.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Keller resume what they were doing, but
     the lights coming on distract them again. They sit
     upright as they hear the outer door sliding open,
     freeing them.

     The lights go on and the door opens behind Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     The blast door raises, freeing Teyla. She leaves
     with a relieved smile.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The door to the lab opens. Katie and McKay stand.

  MCKAY
     (shocked) Oh my god! They found a cure or figured
     out how to override the program. I don't believe
     it! We're going to make it! We're not going to
     die!

  ANNOTATION
     He turns and hugs Katie, who grins and laughs as
     well, but doesn't return the hug as
     enthusiastically. They break apart, and McKay
     notices she's still holding the engagement ring
     box.

  MCKAY
     (awkwardly) Oh.

  KATIE
     (awkwardly) Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     They both stand, not facing each other, in an
     awkward silence.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka, Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon sit at a table
     in the mostly empty room.

  TEYLA
     (skeptical) You crawled the entire way there, in
     those tiny vents?

  RONON
     I'm surprised you even fit in there.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, he fit all right. There's plenty of room.

  ZELENKA
     Well, not "plenty".

  SHEPPARD
     You should've seen him. He looked like one of
     those little hamsters in, uh, one of those...

  ZELENKA
     (dismissively) Yes, yes, yes, yes. The important
     thing is I was able to make it and shut off the
     power in time.

  RONON
     Hey, did you hear? McKay thought it was a real
     outbreak. He even started getting sick; thought he
     was, um--

  ANNOTATION
     He stops talking as he notices Keller approaching.
     He takes his legs off a spare chair and sits up.
     Keller glances at him with a sidelong smile.

  KELLER
     Hi. Mind if I join you?

  SHEPPARD
     Sure, go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon sits up straighter in his seat, sobering the
     half-smile on his face to a scowl as he notices
     Sheppard and Teyla watching them with interest.

  RONON
     (sharply) What?

  SHEPPARD
     (shrugging) Nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter arrives.

  CARTER
     Well, it's been several hours now, and there is no
     indication that anyone out there has picked up our
     alert beacon. I think we're in the clear.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we should keep an eye out, just in case.

  CARTER
     Great work, Radek. Everyone on this base owes you
     a debt of gratitude.

  ANNOTATION
     She clasps him on the shoulder.

  ZELENKA
     (proud) Well, thank you.

  SHEPPARD
     McKay would love this.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone chuckles.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters.

  MCKAY
     Katie?

  ANNOTATION
     Katie appears, rolling a cart full of plants,
     including the Rodneyana Villosa.

  KATIE
     Hello, Rodney. I see you're feeling better.

  MCKAY
     Uh, yes, I...uh...Well, I mean, uh, it was
     probably just...you know...an allergic...thing.
     I'm fine.

  KATIE
     And the, uh, quarantine. Is it true there was no
     outbreak?

  MCKAY
     Uh, no, it was a malfunction. A planetary
     anomaly--ionospheric disturbance. I've actually,
     uh, recalibrated the system, so it'll take into
     effect future activity so, uh, we should be fine.

  KATIE
     Someone said it was Doctor Zelenka that finally
     turned off the self-destruct?

  MCKAY
     (miffed) Technically, yes, but it was actually
     more of a group effort. But that-that's not why I
     came here. I, um... Here's the thing. Over the
     last year and a half, I have become aware that I
     have certain...I don't want to use the word
     "flaws"...uh...uh, "shortcomings", perhaps? You
     know, for example...on occasion, I-I can be
     negative...and-and demanding, and-and a tad
     arrogant. But, uh, I'm also finding that just
     being aware of your, uh, shortcomings?...is-is
     just the first, minute step on the road to
     betterment. And the real trick seems to be
     actually do something about it.

  KATIE
     (uncomfortable) I know. It's difficult.

  MCKAY
     The point is, I came here earlier today to propose
     marriage to you. But after what happened, I
     realize that I may have been...rushing things. I
     just don't think I'm ready for this.

  KATIE
     (soberly) I know.

  MCKAY
     (surprised) You do?

  KATIE
     (nodding) I don't think I'm ready, either.

  MCKAY
     Oh. Okay. Good. That's good. It's not that my
     feelings have changed or diminished--

  KATIE
     No! No, of course not.

  MCKAY
     Just--I mean...if we got married now, I would make
     your life miserable, and-and...you are far too
     good a person for that.

  KATIE
     Don't be so hard on yourself.

  MCKAY
     Easier said than done, right?

  ANNOTATION
     They share sad smiles, then an awkward silence.

  MCKAY
     Okay. So, raincheck on lunch?

  KATIE
     (with false brightness) Absolutely.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns to go.

  KATIE
     Rodney?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns back.

  MCKAY
     Hmm?

  KATIE
     Bye.

  MCKAY
     (casually) Bye.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves--only realizing the air of finality in
     Katie's tone after a few steps. He turns back to
     see her sadly watching him go as the door closes.
