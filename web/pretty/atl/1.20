The Siege Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters, still in the red jumpsuit he had
     worn on the Puddle Jumper. Weir and Sheppard are
     there, Weir carrying a briefcase.

  WEIR
     Welcome back, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Where are we?

  WEIR
     Our scanners show the hive ships have started
     moving again, although their pace has slowed
     considerably.

  SHEPPARD
     Obviously, you gave them something to think about.

  WEIR
     If they get here in two hours or two days, it
     doesn't change the fact that we're out of options.
     We can't hope to fight them. So, unless either of
     you have any more ideas...

  ANNOTATION
     Ford arrives, geared up and holding a machine gun.

  FORD
     The last group is assembled and ready for evac.

  WEIR
     All right, then. Let's get this done.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Weir, and McKay each stand at a
     different laptop.

  WEIR
     Ready?

  ANNOTATION
     They each enter their passwords. After a moment, a
     clock shows ten hours and counting.

  WEIR
     Self-destruct is armed. (to Technician) Prepare to
     load the virus into the Ancient mainframe. Rodney,
     dial the Alpha site.

  MCKAY
     Dialing.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to dial, but stops when chevrons start
     lighting up.

  MCKAY
     We've got an incoming wormhole.

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole forms.

  MCKAY
     We're receiving an IDC.

  SHEPPARD
     Who is it?

  MCKAY
     (amazed) Stargate Command.

  WEIR
     Are you sure?

  MCKAY
     Positive!

  WEIR
     Lower the shields.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Col. Everett and other personnel start coming
     through the 'gate, as well as boxes of supplies.
     Sheppard and the others rush down to meet them.

  EVERETT
     Dr. Weir.

  WEIR
     Yes.

  EVERETT
     Colonel Dillon Everett, United States Marine
     Corps.

  WEIR
     You should know--

  EVERETT
     General O'Neill sends his compliments on a job
     well done under extraordinary circumstances. You
     are relieved.

  SHEPPARD
     Sir, we're about to evacuate?

  EVERETT
     Without a fight.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir.

  WEIR
     On my order.

  EVERETT
     That evacuation order is rescinded. I assume
     you've armed the self-destruct device?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir, we have, but as Dr. Weir was trying to
     tell you--

  EVERETT
     I am going to need you to disarm it immediately.

  WEIR
     Hold on a second, Colonel. I don't think you fully
     grasp our situation.

  EVERETT
     You have three Wraith hive ships bearing down on
     your position and precious little to defend
     yourselves with. That about sum it up?

  MCKAY
     You got our message.

  EVERETT
     We got your message.

  WEIR
     It's down to two hive ships. We managed to destroy
     one.

  EVERETT
     (brightly) Good for you. That should make my job a
     little easier.

  SHEPPARD
     What exactly is your job, sir?

  EVERETT
     (very militarily) I should think that would be
     obvious to you by now, Major. We are going to
     defend Atlantis at all costs.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Everett is walking away, up the stairs.

  WEIR
     Colonel?

  EVERETT
     (handing her a piece of paper) Signed by General
     O'Neill.

  SHEPPARD
     Colonel, it's not that we don't appreciate the
     thought, but if you had read the report on the
     armada headed this way, you'd know that there's
     not much we can do about it.

  EVERETT
     Oh, I read your report cover to cover, Major.

  MCKAY
     They must have found a ZPM. That's the only way
     they could have dialed in from Earth.

  EVERETT
     It was discovered in Egypt by a group of
     archaeologists. The damn thing has been under our
     noses the whole time.

  MCKAY
     Fantastic. Wait a minute. How could you possibly
     bring the ZPM back here? You need it to maintain
     the wormhole.

  EVERETT
     As we speak, it is being transported up to the
     Daedalus, our new battlecruiser.

  MCKAY
     Sister ship of the Prometheus. I didn't even know
     it was finished.

  EVERETT
     With the ZPM boosting her engines, she should be
     here inside of four days. That is how long we have
     to hold this base. Major Sheppard dial Pegasus
     Alpha Site, recall all military personnel. As
     well, any civilians who would like to return and
     help take part in damage control are welcome to do
     so. And when you're done with that, please join me
     and my officers in the conference room. We'll
     discuss our tactical position.

  WEIR
     Colonel Everett? Fine, you're in charge, but I
     should be at that briefing.

  EVERETT
     When it comes down to any other aspect of
     Atlantis, I will be happy to include you. We're
     talking about our tactical position.

  WEIR
     I understand that.

  EVERETT
     Good. Somebody want to please turn off that
     self-destruct?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Everett is being briefed.

  EVERETT
     This schematic is based on the information we got
     in your message. Can I assume it's accurate?

  FORD
     Yes, Sir.

  EVERETT
     Captain, deploy plan alpha-two.

  RADNER
     Yes, Sir. Sergeant, alpha-two.

  FORD
     If you don't mind my asking, Colonel, deploy what
     exactly?

  EVERETT
     We brought along a few rail guns. They were
     originally slated for Prometheus to replace their
     current close-in armament on her next refit. They
     will deliver an impact velocity of Mach 5 at 250
     miles. A standard magazine will hold 10,000
     rounds.

  FORD
     Whoa.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Weir arrive.

  SHEPPARD
     The self-destruct has been aborted.

  EVERETT
     Thank you. Did you contact the Alpha Site?

  WEIR
     I asked Major Sheppard to wait until I had a
     chance to talk with you.

  EVERETT
     Is that a fact?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir.

  EVERETT
     Major, dial the Alpha site.

  WEIR
     Colonel, you've been here all of five minutes.
     Now, I have been responsible for the lives of the
     people on this base both military and civilian,
     for the past several months. I'm not about to put
     those lives in jeopardy until I at least know how
     you intend to defend this city.

  EVERETT
     I don't need to explain myself to you, Doctor, and
     I don't need your cooperation.

  SHEPPARD
     But you could probably use mine. Sir. So with all
     due respect, please answer Dr. Weir's question.

  EVERETT
     Is that a threat, Major?

  SHEPPARD
     No, sir. I understand you need to establish a
     clear chain of command, but if you cut Dr. Weir
     out of the loop, you'll only alienate the people
     whose trust and respect she's earned. Which is
     everyone on the base. Including me.

  EVERETT
     Is that a fact? ...Have a seat.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay talks to Zelenka and other scientists.

  MCKAY
     I should be in that meeting. I am the foremost
     expert on the defense capabilities of this city.

  ZELENKA
     You know how it is. When military steps in,
     scientists take a back seat.

  MCKAY
     Until they need us.

  ZELENKA
     They don't think they need us.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, they don't think they need us right up until
     the point that they need us, and then...they need
     us.

  ZELENKA
     Then they need us. Take a look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     They look down into the control room where SGC
     personnel are un-crating weapons.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

  EVERETT
     Six Naquadah-enhanced nuclear warheads, twelve
     hundred megatons apiece. They emit almost zero EM
     and are otherwise invisible to radar. Once
     deployed, they will detonate by proximity fuse.

  FORD
     Space mines?

  RADNER
     That's right. We'll use jumpers in stealth mode to
     place them in a pattern between the armada and
     Atlantis. Major, we were hoping you could help us
     with that.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, but I recommend keeping a couple in reserve.

  EVERETT
     Negative. We're only going to get one shot at
     this.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, you have to consider the possibility--

  EVERETT
     Four of my men are pilots. Beckett is giving them
     the gene inoculation right now. Assuming it takes,
     you will familiarize them with the jumpers, and
     they will become our fighter screen.

  SHEPPARD
     Along with me.

  EVERETT
     I have another job for you. I understand that this
     base is equipped with a chair weapons platform,
     like the one we found in Antarctica.

  WEIR
     Yes, but we have no way of powering it.

  EVERETT
     We do now. We brought a Mark II Naquadah
     generator.

  RADNER
     We found a way to increase the power output by six
     hundred percent. It won't last nearly as long, but
     it should power the chair for as long as we need
     it to.

  SHEPPARD
     This is beginning to sound like a plan.

  EVERETT
     (sarcastically) I'm glad you approve.
     (officiously) We know this is a long shot, but
     like I said, all we have to do is hold out until
     the Daedalus gets here, then we can use the ZPM to
     power the city shield. Any questions? All right,
     then. (condescending) Now that Dr. Weir has been
     informed of our plans, I would greatly appreciate
     it if you'd execute my order and contact the Alpha
     Site.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard starts to leave.

  EVERETT
     And Major. This is last time I give you an order
     twice.

  SHEPPARD
     Understood.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS TRAINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla spars with a male Athosian, each of them
     holding a knife and stick. Everett and some of his
     men watch from the doorway.

  EVERETT
     (impressed) You must be Teyla.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop sparring, and she touches foreheads with
     the man.

  TEYLA
     And you are Colonel Everett.

  EVERETT
     Major Sheppard spoke very highly of you in his
     report. Of course, a more recent report has me a
     little concerned.

  TEYLA
     You think I may once again fall under the
     influence of the Wraith?

  EVERETT
     Major Sheppard assures me that won't happen, but I
     do need you to stay out of the way.

  TEYLA
     (angry) Do you not need every able body to help
     defend Atlantis?

  EVERETT
     I think we can handle it.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett is in the chair.

  MCKAY
     He's not even trying.

  BECKETT
     We've tried this a dozen times.

  ZELENKA
     But never with this power source.

  BECKETT
     I'm serious. Major Sheppard's your man.

  MCKAY
     Of course he is, but he's training pilots and
     deploying space mines right now, so we're stuck
     with you. Now, listen to me very carefully, do
     exactly what I tell you to do, and hopefully no
     one will get hurt.

  BECKETT
     Rodney, there must be someone else.

  MCKAY
     (sternly) Concentrate on powering up the chair.
     Nothing else, nothing more, nothing but. Don't
     start thinking--

  BECKETT
     Don't tell me what not to start thinking about, or
     I'll start thinking about it!

  MCKAY
     (falsely kind) Please power it up.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett closes his eyes and concentrates. The
     chair powers up.

  MCKAY
     (looking at a tablet) Good. Good... Good.
     And...oh, no.

  BECKETT
     What? Did I do something wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay walks away.

  ZELENKA
     So...see? Nothing to worry about.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay comes back.

  MCKAY
     Get him out of the chair.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay arrives.

  MCKAY
     Elizabeth. Excuse me. I've hooked up the
     generator, and the chair platform is operational.

  EVERETT
     That's good news.

  MCKAY
     Not so much.

  WEIR
     Why? What's wrong?

  MCKAY
     We're down to just a few dozen drones.

  EVERETT
     And you're just finding this out now?

  MCKAY
     There was no way of determining that until the
     chair was initialized, and that was only possible
     once the Mark II was tied in.

  EVERETT
     The chair in Antarctica controlled thousands of
     the damn things.

  MCKAY
     Yes. I know. They were probably used defending
     Atlantis the first time the Wraith attacked the
     Ancients.

  WEIR
     Even a few dozen will help us keep them at bay for
     a while.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm starts blaring.

  WEIR
     What is it?

  TECHNICIAN
     We have incoming. I don't know where they came
     from. They just appeared all of a sudden.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rushes in.

  SHEPPARD
     What's going on?

  WEIR
     We've just detected a wave of objects approaching
     the planet.

  EVERETT
     How many?

  TECHNICIAN
     A hundred plus.

  SHEPPARD
     How come they weren't detected by the long-range
     sensors?

  MCKAY
     Because they're rocks... Asteroids. The Wraith
     must have harvested them from this system's
     asteroid belt and accelerated them towards us from
     a safe distance. The mainframe's taken this long
     to determine that they were a threat.

  WEIR
     Can they do much damage?

  MCKAY
     Oh, yeah. Even if most of them burn off in the
     atmosphere, but...that's not why they're doing it.

  EVERETT
     They're headed toward the mines.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, can they be deactivated?

  EVERETT
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     The display shows the asteroids approaching the
     mines. All of the mines explode in seconds.

  MCKAY
     Well...that's that. Your mines make one hell of a
     bang, Colonel. I'm sure the Wraiths' ears are
     ringing.

  SHEPPARD
     What's the status of the hive ships?

  MCKAY
     There's no way of knowing. The mine detonations
     must have overloaded the sensors.

  EVERETT
     How long till they're back up?

  TECHNICIAN
     There's a lot of residual radiation.

  MCKAY
     It'll keep us blind for hours.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, they're still out there, and we just
     lost our primary line of defense.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ANCIENT ROOM

  SHEPPARD
     You wanted to see me, Colonel?

  EVERETT
     I was told I could learn a lot about the history
     of Atlantis in this room.

  SHEPPARD
     We haven't used it much because of the power
     requirements.

  EVERETT
     Still, I would like to see for myself how the
     Ancients lost the first time, try to avoid their
     mistakes.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir, we could do that.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard activates the console. A display appears
     above them.

  SHEPPARD
     This is the status of the Pegasus Galaxy before
     the Ancients encountered the Wraith. The blue
     stars represent systems either inhabited by or
     protected by the Ancients. Then... This is how it
     looked after they fought for almost a hundred
     years.

  ANNOTATION
     All of the blue stars turn red.

  EVERETT
     Until Atlantis was all that was left?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir. That's when the siege began.

  ANNOTATION
     A planetary-scale display appears. Various battles
     are portrayed as Sheppard speaks.

  SHEPPARD
     For several more years, the Atlantians were able
     to hold off their attackers, relying on the city's
     shield and superior weaponry, including the
     weapons satellite system. No matter how many
     Wraith ships they destroyed, more kept coming
     here. They could win almost every battle, but they
     saw no way to win the war. So...they submerged the
     city...and left.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard deactivates the console.

  SHEPPARD
     That's it. That's the story. But the picture is
     pretty clear.

  EVERETT
     So you think this is a no-win situation?

  SHEPPARD
     No, sir. What I mean is, even if we beat them this
     time, they're going to come back.

  EVERETT
     Major...I think I should tell you that Colonel
     Marshall Sumner was a very good friend of mine. We
     served together a lot of years and you know...I
     cannot, for the life of me, figure how it is that
     you could go as far as you did and not save him.
     How you could get that close--

  SHEPPARD
     By the time I reached Colonel Sumner--

  EVERETT
     Worse, you admit to firing the shot that killed
     him.

  SHEPPARD
     Because I believe that's what he wanted me to do.

  EVERETT
     You knew him that well, did you?

  SHEPPARD
     You weren't there, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Everett approaches Sheppard.

  EVERETT
     I wish, for his sake, I was.

  SHEPPARD
     There isn't a night that doesn't go by where that
     moment doesn't play in my head... And every time
     it does--

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm sounds.

  EVERETT AND SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Control room--

  EVERETT
     (into radio) This is Colonel Everett. Report.

  SOLDIER
     (over radio) Sir, we've just detected a wave of
     darts inbound.

  EVERETT
     (into radio) I'm on my way. (to Sheppard) Head to
     the chair. We'll finish this later.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  EVERETT
     What's happening?

  TECHNICIAN
     Multiple signals, sir, closing fast. Dr. McKay
     must've been right about the nukes damaging the
     sensors. We couldn't see them until they were
     right on top of us.

  EVERETT
     Are my gunners in position?

  TECHNICIAN
     Yes, sir.

  EVERETT
     How about our damage control parties?

  WEIR
     They're all in position.

  EVERETT
     All right. Darken the city.

  ANNOTATION
     The Technician uses controls to darken the city.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rushes in.

  SHEPPARD
     McKay, fire it up!

  MCKAY
     It'll take a minute.

  SHEPPARD
     We don't have a minute.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits in the chair.

  MCKAY
     Look, this generator can only power the chair
     because it operates in a state of
     barely-controlled overload--

  SHEPPARD
     Just get the damn thing working.

  MCKAY
     That's what I'm trying to do.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY

  RADNER
     (into radio) Colonel, it's Radner.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  EVERETT
     (into radio) Go ahead.

  RADNER
     (over radio) It looks like some of them are
     starting to make kamikaze runs.

  ANNOTATION
     There are nearby explosions.

  WEIR
     What happened?

  TECHNICIAN
     We lost primary systems.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY

  AIRMAN
     Go! Go!

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Everett step outside to see the battle
     raging.

  ANNOTATION
     At one rail gun position, a Dart flies over and
     sweeps up all of the personnel in a culling beam.

  EVERETT
     (into radio) One of our gun positions is dark.
     Ferrell, why aren't you firing? Ferrell, report.

  FORD
     (into radio) Colonel, this is Lieutenant Ford. I'm
     near Ferrell's position. I'm on it!

     for the Darts.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY

  ANNOTATION
     Ford take a position by himself at the rail gun
     and fires at the Darts.

  ANNOTATION
     Elsewhere, all personnel fire their weapons.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Drones fly out to meet the Darts; tracers of
     weapons from both size light up the sky. Two Darts
     approach the city. They are both destroyed. The
     blast causes Everett to put his arms protectively
     around Weir on the balcony.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard continues to use the chair, his eyes
     closed.

  ANNOTATION
     The attack appears to be over. Weir and Everett
     survey the situation.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The city is quiet, but smoke rises from several
     damaged sections.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     Power is out in sections of the city. The
     long-range scanners and the internal sensors are
     down, but we're working on it.

  EVERETT
     I want to know the status of those hive ships
     ASAP.

  MCKAY
     They're coming. That's their status. Tomorrow, the
     day after, the day after that--eventually, they'll
     get here. Whether we're here to greet them or not
     is another matter.

  WEIR
     Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Look, the chair is out of drones. How do you
     expect to handle the next wave?

  EVERETT
     I'm open to suggestions.

  MCKAY
     Really?

  SHEPPARD
     We target the hive ships.

  EVERETT
     With what?

  SHEPPARD
     We fly the Puddle Jumper in stealth mode right
     down their throats.

  EVERETT
     Are you volunteering for a suicide mission?

  SHEPPARD
     It won't be a suicide mission if McKay and Zelenka
     can figure out a way to remote control the
     Jumpers.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka and McKay are not pleased.

  EVERETT
     Can you do it?

  MCKAY
     I knew this was going to happen.

  EVERETT
     Is that a fact?

  MCKAY
     Yes, it's a fact. Look, you show up here with your
     guns and your brush cuts, but when it comes to
     actually saving the city you turn to the
     scientists... And every time, what you ask is
     impossible.

  EVERETT
     When was the last time you slept, Doctor?

  MCKAY
     Shut up. I have an idea.

  ZELENKA
     The chair.

  MCKAY
     Of course, the chair. The problem is tying it to
     the Jumper's systems.

  ZELENKA
     Without overloading the generators.

  MCKAY
     Possibly using the drones on the Jumpers
     themselves as a means of propulsion--

  ZELENKA
     While increasing the inertial dampening to
     maximum.

  MCKAY
     It won't be very maneuverable, but possibly,
     possibly...

  EVERETT
     Is that a "yes?"

  MCKAY
     No, it's a "possibly."

  EVERETT
     I'll take it. How much damage can one Puddle
     Jumper do?

  SHEPPARD
     I've got an idea about that, too. I think I know
     where we can get another nuke.

  WEIR
     Major, I don't know how sympathetic the Genii will
     be to our situation.

  EVERETT
     The Genii?

  SHEPPARD
     They want to test their weapon. Now's their
     chance.

  TEYLA
     (from the 'gate room) Let me past! I need to talk
     to Dr. Weir!

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, Everett and Sheppard go to the railing.

  WEIR
     Teyla? What's the matter?

  TEYLA
     The Wraith...they are in Atlantis.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Later, personnel are gearing up in the 'gate room.

  FORD
     The Wraith piloting the kamikaze ships beam into
     the city right before they hit.

  EVERETT
     So they're trying to take the city intact. How
     many are we talking about?

  SHEPPARD
     How many Darts crashed?

  EVERETT
     Between twenty and thirty, and internal sensors
     are still down.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we have this.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes out the life-signs detector.

  SHEPPARD
     It can't differentiate between Wraith and human,
     but if we confine all base personnel to the
     designated areas, the blips that show up out of
     bounds will be the likely targets.

  EVERETT
     Let me see that.

  SHEPPARD
     It won't do you any good. You need the gene.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows Sheppard that it works for him.

  EVERETT
     I got the gene therapy, too.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla arrives with other Athosians.

  TEYLA
     We wish to help. This is quite a large city,
     Colonel. You need as many people searching as
     possible.

  SHEPPARD
     She is the one who sensed the Wraith presence in
     the first place.

  EVERETT
     Captain. Get some weapons for these people.

  RADNER
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett, McKay, and Zelenka arrive.

  BECKETT
     There's other people on this base that possess the
     Ancient gene--Dr. Kusanagi, for example. I'm sure
     she'd relish the opportunity to help.

  MCKAY
     I am exhausted and starving, so sit down. Carson,
     it's out of drones. You couldn't do any damage if
     you wanted to.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett sits in the chair and powers it up.

  MCKAY
     Thank you. Okay, we're in business. (to Zelenka)
     Head down to the Jumper bay. Radio me when you get
     there.

     Ford searches alone. A Wraith soldier hides behind
     a column. When Ford walks past, the Wraith grabs
     Ford and throws him to the floor. The Wraith
     approaches Ford. Sheppard shoots it from behind,
     then shoots it again to make sure it's dead. Ford
     gets up.

  SHEPPARD
     (looking at detector) You okay?

  FORD
     Yeah. How about next time, you can be the bait?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, maybe. Next time. All right, this way.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  TECHNICIAN
     We just received a response from the Genii.

  WEIR

  ANNOTATION
     The Technician plays a recording.

  PRENUM
     (audio) This is Prenum of the Genii. We welcome
     the opportunity to open a dialogue between our two
     people. Send your representative--one person,
     unarmed.

  WEIR
     Is that all?

  TECHNICIAN
     Yes, ma'am.

  WEIR
     (into radio) Colonel Everett, this is Weir. As
     we'd hoped, the Genii have asked us to send a
     representative. I'm set to go.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  EVERETT
     (into radio) Good. I can't imagine anyone more
     qualified. Pull this off, I'll buy you a drink.

LOCATION--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir is led in blindfolded and made to sit in a
     chair. A Genii soldier steps forward to speak; she
     can't see him.

  PRENUM
     Dr. Weir... I am Prenum of the Genii. I'm rather
     surprised. No, astonished that you would have the
     audacity to come here.

  WEIR
     You heard our message. The Wraith are at our
     doorstep.

  PRENUM
     And we are understandably delighted at the
     prospect of your demise.

  WEIR
     That may be so. But still, we have something that
     you want.

  PRENUM


  C4.


  WEIR
     More than that. We have an opportunity for you to
     test your weapon at no risk to yourselves, and a
     chance to strike at the Wraith. You have no idea
     how close they are.

  PRENUM
     (walking around her) The Wraith have come, Doctor.
     Six days ago. Fortunately, we detected their
     approach and we were able to shut down our
     reactors in time. Hundreds of lives were lost on
     the surface, but thousands more were saved because
     our underground complex went undetected. So, you
     see, the threat to the Genii has come and gone. So
     far as the Wraith are concerned, this planet is no
     longer of interest to them. We have the design
     that Dr. McKay provided for us, and our prototype
     bombs are nearly complete.

  WEIR
     So why would you ask me to come here?

  PRENUM
     So that we may trade the C4...for your life.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     Everett and his mean hear gunfire and an
     explosion. He moves toward it and finds a solider

     Damn it. (into radio) This is Everett. The Wraith
     just took out one of our generators.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     We'll meet you there.


LOCATION--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM

  WEIR
     I have already offered you the C4.

  PRENUM
     And you want our prototype weapons in exchange.
     That's not a bargain for the Genii.

  WEIR
     What would you do if you had the C4 right now?
     Incorporate it into your weapons?

  PRENUM
     Yes.

  WEIR
     And you would test them.

  PRENUM
     Of course.

  WEIR
     I am offering you the chance to test your weapon
     design on a Wraith hive ship, at no risk to your
     own people, and still have enough to build dozens
     more. Now, if you are too proud or too stupid to
     see--

  PRENUM
     Be careful, Doctor.

  WEIR
     I am way past careful. Now, you know what the deal
     is, and it's a damn good one, so take it or leave
     it.

     on the hive ships.

  EVERETT

     Four has just informed us the Wraith hive ships
     are approaching the planet. Defense team, to your
     positions. (to Weir) Doctor?

  WEIR
     Thank you. (into city-wide intercom) This is Weir.
     Now, I know how tired you all are, and how much we
     have asked of you these past few days. Hopefully,
     the Daedalus will arrive soon, but until that
     happens, our fate is in our own hands. If, during
     the course of this battle, that mission fails, I
     will give the order to evacuate. Now, we all hope
     it won't come to that, but if it does...don't
