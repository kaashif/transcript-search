<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>MCKAY: Let me ask you a question. Say there's a runaway train. It's hurtling out of control towards ten people standing in the middle of the tracks. Only way to save those people is to flip a switch, send the train down another set of tracks. The only problem is--there is a baby in the middle of those tracks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>MCKAY: Well, I-I don't know. That's not the point. It's an ethical dilemma. Look, Katie Brown brought it up over dinner the other night. Question is: is it appropriate to divert the train and kill the one baby to save the ten people?</td></tr>

There were several Ancient consoles and screens. It was quite an impressive layout. As usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we entered.</td></tr>

We found ourselves stalled in our development, unwilling to push forward without the Oracle's guidance, hoping one day he would return to us. And two years ago, he did. The Oracle resumed communicating with us, teaching us many new things. He challenged us to think, to push the limit of our scientific endeavors. He changed the name of our country, and even revealed his likeness to us.</td></tr>
