The Game
TEASER

LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team eats their meals together in the
     crowded mess hall.

  MCKAY
     Let me ask you a question. Say there's a runaway
     train. It's hurtling out of control towards ten
     people standing in the middle of the tracks. Only
     way to save those people is to flip a switch, send
     the train down another set of tracks. The only
     problem is--there is a baby in the middle of those
     tracks.

  TEYLA
     Why would anyone leave a baby in harm's way like
     that?

  MCKAY
     Well, I-I don't know. That's not the point. It's
     an ethical dilemma. Look, Katie Brown brought it
     up over dinner the other night. Question is: is it
     appropriate to divert the train and kill the one
     baby to save the ten people?

  RONON
     Wouldn't the people just see the train coming and
     move?

  MCKAY
     No. No, they wouldn't see it.

  RONON
     Why not?

  MCKAY
     (sighing) Well, look, I don't know. Say they're
     blind.

  TEYLA
     All of them?

  MCKAY
     (getting annoyed) Yes. All of them.

  RONON
     Then why don't you just call out and tell them to
     move out of the way?

  MCKAY
     Oh, because they can't hear you.

  SHEPPARD
     What, they're deaf too? How fast is the train
     going?

  MCKAY
     (exasperated) Look, the speed doesn't matter!

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, sure it does. If it's going slow enough, you
     could...outrun it and shove everyone to the side.

  RONON
     Or better yet, go get the baby.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Sheppard exchange agreeing nods before
     Sheppard takes a bite of his orange.

  MCKAY
     Oh, for god's sake, I was just trying to--

  WEIR
     (over radio) Rodney...?

  MCKAY
     Wh-yes. Go ahead.

  WEIR
     (over radio) Major Lorne just dialed in from
     M4D-058. He says he's got something you'll want to
     see.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     He stands and starts to leave.

  MCKAY
     (to team) Work it out.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard stand with Weir looking at a
     monitor which shows Lorne crouched low by a wall.

  LORNE
     (over video) We came through the space gate and
     immediately noticed a bunch of small satellites in
     geo-synchronous orbit above the planet.

  WEIR
     (into radio) An advanced civilization?

  LORNE
     (over video) That's what we thought. Then we
     picked up life signs directly below, so we flew
     down--saw several villages separated by a large
     river and decided to check one of them out. And as
     you can see... (to sergeant off-camera)
     Sergeant...?

  ANNOTATION
     The sergeant moves the camera to show the village
     below the wall. The people are using wooden
     wheelbarrows and simple tools as they go about
     their daily business.

  LORNE
     (continuing, over video) These people...don't
     exactly look like they're ready to be launching
     any satellites, at least not for the next five
     hundred years or so.

  SHEPPARD
     Ancients probably put them up there.

  MCKAY
     (agreeing) Mmm.

  WEIR
     (to McKay, but heard on radio) Send a science team
     to check it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne, now back on camera, looks amused.

  LORNE
     (over video) Uh, actually...I think Doctor McKay
     may want to come check this one out for himself.

  MCKAY
     Why?

  LORNE
     Take a look.

  ANNOTATION
     The off-camera sergeant pans the camera again and
     zooms its focus onto a small banner hanging from a
     building. It has a red stripe on each side of the
     banner, and in the white center is a picture of
     McKay's face.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, Sheppard and McKay stare at the image in
     shock. Sheppard bites his lip as he and McKay
     exchange looks--as if they know something about
     this after all and also know they're in trouble.


LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Weir storms into her office, McKay and Sheppard
     following.

  WEIR
     (furious) How the hell did your face get on that
     flag?!

  MCKAY
     Oh, uh, I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir stares from McKay to Sheppard, aware they
     know more to this than they're saying.

  MCKAY
     (perplexed) Wai-wait. Here's the thing though.
     That flag's very similar to the one I designed in
     our game.

  SHEPPARD
     (snappish) It's exactly like the one you designed
     in our game.

  WEIR
     What game?

  SHEPPARD
     The game Rodney and I have been playing.

  MCKAY
     (innocently) Yeah, we didn't tell you about the
     game?

  SHEPPARD
     We've been playing for a while now.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, off and on in our spare time--you know, uh,
     at night, between missions, I could've sworn we
     told you about it.

  WEIR
     (impatient) What. Game?

  MCKAY
     Well, it started a while ago...

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--"GAME" ROOM, ATLANTIS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and a science team enter the room. The
     control panels light up.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Uh, a few months after we arrived
     here, we were exploring the city, checking out
     some labs on the East Pier when we discovered a
     room. There were several Ancient consoles and
     screens. It was quite an impressive layout. As
     usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we
     entered.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay goes to a monitor, which shows a landscape
     with a winding river.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) At first, we thought it was some kind
     of a geological facility. There was a screen with
     a map that we assumed was of the Lantian mainland.

  WEIR
     Yes, I remember you briefing me about that.

  MCKAY
     Right, there you go. We did tell you.

  WEIR
     You mentioned nothing about a game, though.

  SHEPPARD
     That's because at first we didn't know what it
     was....

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sits at one of the panels. He punches
     controls and pulls up more menus on the screen.

  SHEPPARD
     (continuing) Then, Rodney studied it more closely.
     He realized it wasn't a geological lab at all.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) No, it turns out, it was it was in
     fact a-a-a kind of a...Ancient game room. The map
     was of a fictional civilization. It was part of a
     simulated world.

  ANNOTATION
     The McKay in the flashback grins at his find.

  MCKAY
     Sweet!

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, what you do, is you take these countries
     that are already in a database and you assume
     control of them.

  MCKAY
     Two societies, separated by a river straight down
     the middle. Sheppard took one country, I took the
     other.

  SHEPPARD
     First thing Rodney did, besides renaming his
     country, is put his face all over the flag.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard chuckles and rolls his eyes. McKay also
     chuckles and grins. Weir looks very unamused.

  WEIR
     I think you need to check this planet out.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard's grins fade. Abashed, they
     leave.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A puddle jumper comes through the space gate and
     flies around M4D-058.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  TEYLA
     So...the Ancestors created this game?

  MCKAY
     Yes, but this is no ordinary game. I mean, it is
     incredibly challenging, instructional...I mean the
     sheer number of options built into it? Staggering.

  TEYLA
     How does one play it?

  SHEPPARD
     You gotta figure out the best way to run your
     country.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, you build roads, you, uh, establish laws,
     mold it to your own specific ideology.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay sit across from each other,
     each with a computer in front of them. Their
     monitors show the river landscape. Sheppard looks
     over at Rodney's side as if trying to guess what
     he's doing.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) You can control everything. Proper
     sanitation systems, water delivery.

  SHEPPARD
     (voiceover) Transportation...

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) I mean, every detail can be
     manipulated...I mean, right down to the women's
     hairstyles.

  ANNOTATION
     On McKay's computer, he pulls up a computer image
     of a woman avatar. She wears a white dress with
     red trim, but there are other options. She has
     shoulder length red hair and green eyes. McKay
     changes the hair to blond and short.

  MCKAY
     Hello there.

  RONON
     So how do you win this game?

  SHEPPARD
     It's not really about winning.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard study information on their
     respective monitors. They peer over their monitor
     to look at each other.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Yeah, it's more about whose society
     outshines the other's. I mean, who creates a
     better infrastructure.

  MCKAY
     (continuing, smugly) ...who's better at trade.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard glares at McKay.

  MCKAY
     (innocently) What? Hey, don't start. I tried to
     negotiate with you.

  SHEPPARD
     Making a list of demands and not giving anything
     in return is not negotiating.

  MCKAY
     I offered you an entire crop of beans.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't need beans, I need lumber.

  MCKAY
     Oh, right, to build defensive fortifications for
     your army, which he doubled in size, by the way.
     Surprise, surprise.

  ANNOTATION
     They glance back, making their arguments to Ronon
     and Teyla, who look equally amused and bemused by
     the conversation.

  SHEPPARD
     I only did that after you started cheating.

  MCKAY
     I did not cheat!

  SHEPPARD
     He's giving his people way too much technology for
     their level of development. I'm not the only one
     increasing my army, by the way.

  MCKAY
     I had to do something to protect the people of
     Geldar from you.

  RONON
     Geldar?

  SHEPPARD
     It's the name of Rodney's country. He named it
     after a girl he stalked in college.

  MCKAY
     I did not stalk her. We dated...twice. Theresa
     Geldar. Very cute blonde. I always used to think
     her name reminded me of some kind of
     a...mythological land: the kingdom of Geldar.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla smiles, then taps Sheppard on the arm.

  TEYLA
     What'd you call your country?

  SHEPPARD
     (shrugging) Well, I...just...kept the name it
     already had.

  ANNOTATION
     The HUD pulls up an image of a hundred satellites
     in a square pattern, floating over the planet.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, there are the satellites.

  TEYLA
     Dozens of them.

  MCKAY
     Positioned directly above the continent. Perfect
     grid. Ten-by-ten. Should have a visual on one of
     them...


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper approaches a satellite.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  RONON
     Definitely looks Ancient.

  MCKAY
     Huh. And active. It's transmitting a tremendous
     amount of data.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, let's check it out.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper flies down to the surface of M4D-058.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A couple watch a primitive version of a movie on a
     cylindrical wheel; it shows an animation of a man
     who has his head pop off and go back on. Other
     vendors sell telescopes and other science
     equipment. Sheppard's team walks among the crowd.
     The villagers who spot McKay stop what they're
     doing and stare at him. Many of the women in the
     village have short blond hair.

  MCKAY
     This is amazing!

  RONON
     If you say so.

  ANNOTATION
     A man drives by on an early version of a bicycle,
     with a large front wheel and smaller rear one.

  SHEPPARD
     (sarcastic) Oh, yeah. That's something you see in
     every medieval village.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well, the...Renaissance obviously came early
     to these folks.

  SHEPPARD
     What, a couple hundred years early?

  ANNOTATION
     More and more of the crowd have noticed McKay and
     have started whispering to each other. The team
     notices their interest and begins to feel
     uncomfortable under the scrutiny.

  TEYLA
     Um...Rodney?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon picks up a tricked-out crossbow on a
     vendor's table and studies it as the crowd seems
     to watch with awe--their attention stuck on McKay.
     He stares back at them, bewildered, not noticing
     he's standing under a painting of...himself in the
     same pose, complete with jacket with the Canadian
     flag patch. The painting has a halo over McKay's
     head. Nola begins to approach. Sheppard looks from
     the painting to McKay, nonplussed.

  SHEPPARD
     (whispering harshly to McKay) Say something!

  MCKAY
     (low, to Sheppard) Like what?

  SHEPPARD
     (low, to McKay) I don't know!

  NOLA
     Hello. I am Nola.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well, uh...this is Lieutenant Colonel John
     Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and
     I'm...McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay.

  ANNOTATION
     He flashes Nola, who is an attractive young woman
     with short blond hair, a charming smile. Nola
     steps forward and studies McKay's features
     intently, glancing up to the portrait behind him.

  SHEPPARD
     The resemblance is...uncanny.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay glances back, finally seeing the portrait.

  NOLA
     (awed) You are the Oracle!

  MCKAY
     The Oracle?

  ANNOTATION
     Nola steps back and bows deeply. All the villagers
     follow suit.

  NOLA
     Welcome to Geldar.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks shocked, and guilty. Sheppard shoots
     him a narrow look.


LOCATION--PORTAL BUILDING CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Nola leads the team down a stone corridor.

  NOLA
     Please forgive my nervousness. I never thought
     you'd appear to us in the flesh.

  TEYLA
     Why do you refer to him as "the Oracle"?

  ANNOTATION
     Nola looks to McKay for permission to speak, he
     shrugs and waves his hand.

  NOLA
     The Oracle is a wise and omnipotent deity.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Ronon) Boy, she's in for a rude awakening.

  NOLA
     Thousands of years ago, he gave our ancestors
     life. He instructed them how to build their
     society, how to live their lives. His guidance was
     revered by all. Then one day, without warning, the
     Oracle ceased all communications.

  RONON
     (to Sheppard) War with the Wraith.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard nods in agreement.

  NOLA
     Our people were puzzled by this, but they
     continued to adhere to his instructions, living
     their lives according to his teachings which they
     passed down from generation to generation.

  ANNOTATION
     They pass more portraits of McKay.

  TEYLA
     Have you not had any trouble with the Wraith?

  NOLA
     Yes. They've come periodically--culled our people,
     destroyed our villages. Those who survived
     rebuilt, but only to the level at which the Oracle
     had instructed before he left. We found ourselves
     stalled in our development, unwilling to push
     forward without the Oracle's guidance, hoping one
     day he would return to us. And two years ago, he
     did. The Oracle resumed communicating with us,
     teaching us many new things. He challenged us to
     think, to push the limit of our scientific
     endeavors. He changed the name of our country, and
     even revealed his likeness to us.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay grins smugly at yet another portrait.
     Sheppard shakes his head in disgust.

  SHEPPARD
     Enough with the pictures.


LOCATION--PORTAL CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks down over a balcony to the floor
     below, where people work around an Ancient device
     that shows a map of the continent, similar to that
     of the game.

  MCKAY
     Ah, and you communicate through that.

  NOLA
     The portal, yes.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     The team heads down the stairs to the console.

  NOLA
     It's through this that we receive our
     instructions.

  TEYLA
     And the Oracle knows when you've carried them out?

  NOLA
     Yes.

  MCKAY
     It's the satellites! They must be tracking
     everything that's going on and then relaying it
     via subspace back to Atlantis. It's remarkable!

  RONON
     So, not a game after all.

  MCKAY
     No, it's obviously some kind of, uh, Ancient
     experiment, uh, social development, to try out
     different ways to create civilizations.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard points to the symbol of an area on the
     other side of the river.

  SHEPPARD
     This country here...?

  NOLA
     Hallona.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard preens.

  NOLA
     A persistent thorn in our side.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's face falls.

  NOLA
     (to McKay) Now that you've come to us, you can
     help us remove it.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DUSK


LOCATION--GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka, Lorne, and Weir stand in front of the
     console.

  WEIR
     So this is it?

  ZELENKA
     (awed) Yes. Yes, it is an amazing piece of
     technology. It appears to be a sociological
     experiment designed by the Ancients to help them
     as they were seeding various civilizations
     throughout Pegasus. I-I've had a chance to look at
     it further, and it-it's interesting, there are
     many more civilizations in the game's database.

  WEIR
     Really? I thought Rodney said there were only two.

  ZELENKA
     That's what he thought. The actual countries that
     he and Colonel Sheppard are controlling are on
     this specific planet, but I've been able to access
     the codes to unlock additional levels to the
     game...I-I mean, to the ex-experiment. I
     discovered countries on-on planets throughout the
     galaxy. Some have been idle for the past ten
     thousand years, I guess awaiting instructions from
     the Ancients, but some have managed to develop on
     their own, even flourish. Some have been destroyed
     by war, and others have been...completely wiped
     out. Er, not that R-Rodney's and Colonel
     Sheppard's societies are on this path.

  ANNOTATION
     They stare at the civilizations shown on the
     monitor.

  WEIR
     (concerned) So much power at one's fingertips.

  ZELENKA
     (enchanted) It's amazing the attraction of
     this...game.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir shoots him a worried look.


LOCATION--GELDAR VILLAGE SQUARE

  ANNOTATION
     Nola sits at an outdoor table with McKay. Helkin
     unfurls a blueprint for a dirigible.

  NOLA
     We've managed to achieve propulsion through hand
     powered propellers, but now we're undertaking
     tests of steam-powered propulsion.

  MCKAY
     Oh.

  HELKIN
     Only this morning, I completed a test that proved
     quite promising.

  MCKAY
     (nonplussed) Really, that's great.

  NOLA
     (anxious) You're pleased?

  MCKAY
     Yes. Yes! I mean, this is quite an achievement.

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of McKay's teammates arrive with a man
     dressed in chain mail, Baden. The villagers watch
     warily as he approaches. Nola stands when she
     spots Baden, looking angry.

  NOLA
     What's he doing here?

  BADEN
     It wasn't my idea.

  ANNOTATION
     A bewildered McKay looks between them.

  SHEPPARD
     Doctor Rodney McKay, meet Baden.

  MCKAY
     (disdainfully) Oh, your guy.

  SHEPPARD
     My guy.

  MCKAY
     Eh, it figures.

  NOLA
     I should have you arrested for trespassing.

  BADEN
     Go ahead and try.

  SHEPPARD
     Easy now. I brought him here because we need to
     have a little discussion.

  NOLA
     I have nothing to say to him.

  BADEN
     Fine with me.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to leave, but Ronon blocks his path,
     looking menacing.

  SHEPPARD
     Eh, maybe not. But we definitely have something to
     say to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, they all sit around the table.

  SHEPPARD
     So, his story's pretty much the same as Nola's.
     His ancestors received instructions from their
     Oracle, who disappeared for thousands of years,
     only to suddenly resume communicating a few years
     ago.

  MCKAY
     (snidely) Let me guess, he told you to double the
     size of your army.

  SHEPPARD
     (snidely) Yes, he has a capable army...and some
     nice villages. No people riding bicycles or hot
     air balloons, because we weren't cheating!

  MCKAY
     I didn't cheat!

  NOLA
     Have you come to agree to our trade proposals?

  BADEN
     You mean demands? Never.

  NOLA
     (standing) Then I refuse to sit at the same
     table...

  MCKAY
     (quickly) Look, look, please sit.

  ANNOTATION
     Nola complies.

  MCKAY
     Thank you.

  TEYLA
     This...hostility between you. Have your people
     lived like this for thousands of years?

  NOLA
     No. There was once peace between our lands.

  MCKAY
     (with regret) Oh, no.

  SHEPPARD
     (hesitantly) So this...hostility...um...did it
     start a few years ago.

  NOLA
     Yes. Shortly after the Oracle resumed
     communicating with us.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange sheepish looks; Teyla
     and Ronon exchange glances.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir has left Zelenka and Lorne, who are studying
     the readout of a civilization.

  LORNE
     So...they're starving?

  ZELENKA
     Well, not as of yet, but if they don't change
     their approach to agriculture, it won't be too
     long before many of their people go hungry. The
     frustrating thing is, there is a large piece of
     fertile soil in the south of the country that
     would be idea for a tuber cultivation, you know?

  LORNE
     Sorry, "tuber"?

  ZELENKA
     Tuber, yeah, tuber. It, eh, it is, uh, indigenous
     to the planet. It's like a potato.

  LORNE
     So why didn't you just say "potato"?

  ZELENKA
     Because it's not a potato!
     It's-it's...it's...larger...it-it-it has the same
     texture and nutrients as a potato,
     but...it's...like a cantaloupe.

  LORNE
     That's a pretty big potato.

  ZELENKA
     Uh-huh. It is a big potato.

  LORNE
     So, if they plant this thing there, it'll grow?

  ZELENKA
     Yeah, oh yes. Oh, whole fields of it. I mean, they
     could sustain an entire village, but...they're
     oblivious to it.

  LORNE
     Then tell them...anonymously. Oh, come on, Doc.
     You can either stand here and let the people die,
     or you can...help them out. Sounds like a
     no-brainer to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka considers this.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Nola, Baden, Helkin, and others stand around the
     terminal with the Atlantis team.

  MCKAY
     As soon as we input the instructions into our
     console, they are...relayed back to this device by
     a number of satellites in orbit over your planet.
     Once you've carried out the instructions, the
     satellites transmit the real-time results back to
     us on our homeworld.

  NOLA
     (upset and confused) So...you're saying this is a
     game?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks from Nola to Baden who looks equally
     disturbed.

  MCKAY
     No...no. Uh-uh, well...we thought it was a game,
     but, uh...

  SHEPPARD
     We didn't know there were real people on the other
     end.

  BADEN
     You are the Oracle?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm your Oracle, yes...That doesn't sound right.

  TEYLA
     I-I know this is difficult to absorb, but...it is
     all true.

  RONON
     You flew in the puddle jumper; you know they have
     the technology.

  BADEN
     I'm not listening to this.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to leave. Sheppard stops him.

  SHEPPARD
     Hold on a sec, now. We can prove it to you.

  BADEN
     How?

  SHEPPARD
     Let's go for a ride.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and a security contingent are already in the
     control room as Sheppard's team, Baden, and Nola
     come down the stairwell from the jumper bay.

  SHEPPARD
     Baden, Nola, this is Doctor Weir, leader of our
     expedition.

  WEIR
     Welcome to Atlantis. If these two gentlemen
     haven't done so already, let me please offer you
     our sincerest apologies for this intrusion into
     your lives.

  ANNOTATION
     Baden and Nola wander to the inner balcony of the
     control room.

  SHEPPARD
     (protesting) "Intrusion?"

  MCKAY
     An imposition, maybe...and a benevolent one at
     that! I mean, if you could've seen the villages
     now compared to the way they were when we
     started--

  WEIR
     Rodney! Now, why don't you take them to your
     "game" room? Show them what you two've been up to?

  MCKAY
     Right. Shall we?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay leads them away.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay shows a computer display to Nola and Baden.
     Sheppard is nearby.

  MCKAY
     So...this is Geldar, and this is Hallona. Look,
     two weeks ago I instructed you to start digging a
     well for the new settlement on the eastern slope,
     and...look here. (typing on computer) There, see?
     Construction's already begun.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks up, proud. Nola looks at the display,
     stunned.

  NOLA
     Yes. I gave the order myself. (upset) Our lives
     are just a game.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, now, no! They're not games to you, and, in
     our defense, we were trying to improve your lives.

  MCKAY
     It's like he said, everything we did, every
     instruction we gave was to better conditions for
     your people.

  SHEPPARD
     (low voice) And if that meant cheating...

  MCKAY
     Okay, you know, enough with that already!

  ANNOTATION
     Baden watches everything. Nola just stares in
     despair.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GUEST QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Nola sits stiffly on the bed. McKay stands nearby.

  MCKAY
     Is the room...okay?

  NOLA
     (blankly) It's fine.

  MCKAY
     Well then, if you, uh, if you need anything at
     all...don't hesitate to ask, okay? You hungry?
     'Cause-cause, we could, uh, walk across to the
     mess hall. They've got, um, I think it's, uh,
     salisbury steak today? It's very good. They
     have-they have a gravy they put on the-on the
     steak part, and, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's voice trails off into silence.

  NOLA
     (upset) The Oracle was a god to us! I believed in
     his teachings--so much so that my people elected
     me leader because of my passion for scientific
     advancement.

  MCKAY
     Well, they-they obviously made the right choice.

  NOLA
     Now I must resolve myself to the fact...that the
     Oracle is only a man.

  MCKAY
     (contrite) Yeah. Sorry about that. So...it's like
     I said though, I...I did what I did with the best
     of intentions.

  NOLA
     (bitter) To win a game.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay rushes over and sits next to her.

  MCKAY
     No! No-no. It is not about winning or losing.
     Look, the information I gave you and your people
     is very real, very useful! I've set you on a
     course that will allow you to develop into a-into
     a modern society. I mean, where were you two years
     ago, huh? You were a primitive, disparate cluster
     of villages stalled in development. Now you're
     making dirigibles! Do you have any idea how
     momentous that is?

  NOLA
     The Oracle once said: "Ask not what Geldar can do
     for you, but what you can do for Geldar." Those
     were your words.

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Um...give or take.

  NOLA
     They are very wise.

  MCKAY
     (looking away) Yes. Yes, they are.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Baden sit in the empty mess hall.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, now that you know the truth, uh, you can go
     back to living your own lives, and we
     won't...bother you anymore.

  BADEN
     No. You must still help us.

  SHEPPARD
     You don't need our help. You'll be fine.

  BADEN
     We need more weapons. The flying machine you
     brought us here in...you called it a "puddle
     jumper". Our army could use it.

  SHEPPARD
     (uncomfortable, but firm) No. Can't do that.

  BADEN
     But you encouraged me to increase the military.

  SHEPPARD
     In response to McKay...the other Oracle doing
     things that I thought were, uh...

  BADEN
     Aggressive? Arrogant? Demeaning to me and my
     people?!

  SHEPPARD
     I-I will give you arrogant and demeaning, but
     uh...

  BADEN
     The people of Geldar have started digging a mine
     beneath our borders to exploit coal resources on
     our land!

  SHEPPARD
     (leaning forward, intrigued) Really?

  BEDEN
     It was only confirmed yesterday. This after
     several diplomatic attempts to reach a compromise.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we couldn't come to an agreement, but-but I
     didn't think he would start digging.

  BEDEN
     I'm curious to know what response you would have
     to such an incursion. I believe your next command
     would be to launch an attack on the mine. Prevent
     them from digging further? I'm right, aren't I?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard fidgets, but doesn't deny it.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard walk with Weir.

  WEIR
     Did they believe you?

  MCKAY
     Yes, they are fully aware of the situation--not
     too thrilled, obviously.

  SHEPPARD
     We've got a big problem, though.

  WEIR
     (sighing) What is it?

  SHEPPARD
     Game or no game, the fact remains, we've started
     something these people don't seem to want to stop.
     They hate each other and may be headed for a very
     real...war.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir stops short.

  WEIR
     (sarcastic) Great. Great. And this is thanks to
     your..."benevolent imposition"?

  ANNOTATION
     She storms off.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir sits at the center table. Nola sits at one of
     the side tables, Baden at an opposite one.

  WEIR
     I've asked you both here this morning so we can
     have a face-to-face talk. Now, hopefully, I can
     help you reach an understanding.

  NOLA
     Where is Doctor McKay?

  WEIR
     Well, I've asked that neither he nor Colonel
     Sheppard participate in this. I think they've
     already done enough in fostering the current
     tension between you. Now, I have had some
     experience brokering peace treaties; I'm sure we
     can find some common ground.

  ANNOTATION
     Nola and Baden look resistant, and say nothing.

  WEIR
     Okay...why don't we start by going back a few
     years, to the time when your two peoples lived in
     peace?

  NOLA
     We were naive back then--ignorant to our
     potential. Once we began to challenge ourselves
     intellectually, we began to see how the people of
     Hallona had been abusing thousands of years of
     kindness from us.

  BADEN
     I've done everything I could to achieve peace with
     you.

  NOLA
     Really? Such as?

  BADEN
     I sent gifts of good will.

  NOLA
     You sent crates of citrus fruit. Citrus! Do you
     have any idea what an insult that is to my
     people?!

  BEDEN
     It didn't used to be.

  WEIR
     Okay, see, I think I know where that comes from.
     Did..."the Oracle"...tell you that citrus fruit
     was bad?

  NOLA
     He made us aware of its toxic properties, yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir opens her mouth to respond, but Baden cuts
     in.

  BADEN
     Everything is toxic to you! If they're not busy
     insulting us, they're complaining about
     contaminated food, improper hygiene. Even the
     sunlight is dangerous to them!

  ANNOTATION
     Weir nods in understanding, but can't break into
     the conversation.

  NOLA
     The only insult has been your unwillingness to
     compromise in any trade negotiation. Instead, you
     choose to increase the size of your army.

  BADEN
     You built an army, too!

  NOLA
     Only in response to your aggression.

  BADEN
     My aggression? You dig a mine beneath our border
     to steal our coal, and you have the nerve to talk
     about aggression?!

  NOLA
     We're not stealing your co--

  BADEN
     You crossed into our land!

  NOLA
     What do you need it for anyway? It's not like you
     know the first thing about what to do with it!

  BADEN
     You see how she insults us?

  NOLA
     (cuttingly) By stating a fact!

  WEIR
     Okay, please! If we could discuss this reasonably,
     I'm sure we can come to some sort of--

  NOLA
     We've tried! They agree to nothing. And until
     Doctor McKay is brought into this discussion, I
     have nothing further to say.

  ANNOTATION
     Nola leaves. Baden shrugs helplessly and also
     leaves. Weir sits alone.

  WEIR
     (to herself) That went well.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Weir talks with Sheppard and McKay as they head
     down a corridor.

  WEIR
     Talk to them. Get them back to the table and
     hammer out a truce. I have run into a roadblock.

  MCKAY
     (surprised) Really? Nola seemed very agreeable.

  SHEPPARD
     (snidely) To you.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well more agreeable than "Richard the
     Lionheart".

  WEIR
     They are both refusing to compromise. You seem to
     have convinced them that they can't make any
     decisions without your guidance!

  SHEPPARD
     That's not true!

  WEIR
     (sighing, frustrated) Tell them that!


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Nola tries a bowl of blue Jell-O for the first
     time. McKay sits across the table from her.

  NOLA
     This is delicious!

  MCKAY
     Listen, you need to make peace with the people of
     Hallona. If-if tensions keep rising like this, it
     could lead to war.

  NOLA
     (nodding, somber) I'm aware of that.

  MCKAY
     Well, then you're also aware that people will get
     hurt.

  NOLA
     I know the danger to my people. I also know you've
     taught us things Baden's band of knuckle-draggers
     won't learn for hundreds of years.

  MCKAY
     (preening) Huh. Well...

  NOLA
     Under your leadership, we hope to remain many
     steps ahead of any kind of aggression from them.

  MCKAY
     Nola, you and your people need to start thinking
     for yourselves. Look, I'm not going to be there
     for you anymore. You need to-to take control of
     your own lives, start making your own decisions
     about your future. And there can be no future
     without peace.

  NOLA
     I agree.

  MCKAY
     Good.

  NOLA
     And as soon as the people of Hallona either
     concede or get out of our way, peace will be
     restored. What you told me before, I do realize
     how monumental our progress has been, and I refuse
     to let Baden destroy that. "Great spirits have
     always encountered opposition from mediocre
     minds." Those are the words of the Oracle. You
     words.

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Einstein's, actually, but...

  NOLA
     If we yield one bit to Hallona, it will be equal
     to taking a giant step back in our development. I
     owe it to my people to make sure that does not
     happen.

  MCKAY
     (sighing) Hmm.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Baden study a display.

  BADEN
     They're digging further. Every hour, they intrude
     deeper into our land.

  SHEPPARD
     To get them to stop, you have to provide an
     incentive.

  BADEN
     Like attacking the mine?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that'll cause a whole 'nother set of
     problems.

  BADEN
     The only problems will be with the people of
     Geldar.

  SHEPPARD
     Not necessarily. They can fight back.

  BADEN
     What are you saying? We should capitulate? Let
     them do whatever they want?

  SHEPPARD
     No, you make a deal. Trade. Say...you decide to
     share some of your weaponry, and they in turn,
     give you some of their technology.

  WEIR
     (over radio) John?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard turns his back on Baden and walks to a
     corner of the room to converse in private.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Go ahead.

  WEIR
     (over radio) How's it going?

  ANNOTATION
     While Sheppard speaks, Baden notices his
     inattention and hurriedly types some commands into
     the computer connected to his home-world.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Well...he's being a little...uh...

  WEIR
     (over radio) Stubborn?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) I was going to use a different word.

  ANNOTATION
     Baden finishes and steps back, trying to look
     innocent. The computer beeps its acceptance of the
     commands. Sheppard overhears the computer beep and
     stiffens.

  WEIR
     (over radio) Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard turns and studies Baden suspiciously.
     Baden pretends to look oblivious as he stands
     several feet back, studying the computer screen
     with interest.

  WEIR
     (over radio) I'd like you to come to my office. We
     need to talk.


LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard sit in the chairs in front of
     Weir's desk.

  WEIR
     They're not open to any kind of deal?

  SHEPPARD
     Not yet. Maybe we should stick them in a room,
     force them to come to an agreement.

  MCKAY
     (blithely) Don't worry about it, they'll work it
     out. Look, we just happened to catch them at a
     particularly bad time. Sheppard's guy's been doing
     a lot of aggressive posturing of late.

  SHEPPARD
     The only aggression is coming from the people of
     "Gelding".

  MCKAY
     Geldar.

  SHEPPARD
     Whatever! His people are digging a mine across the
     border into Hallona.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir looks expectantly at McKay, who looks guilty.

  MCKAY
     (defensively) The coal resources straddle the
     border between my country and his.

  SHEPPARD
     Barely! They go three miles into my country, which
     your people are happily tunneling into.

  MCKAY
     It has been a point of contention between us,
     okay? But it is just a-a difference in
     cartographic interpretation. "To-may-to,
     to-mah-to."

  SHEPPARD
     No, no. It's pretty clear cut. You entered
     illegally into my country.

  WEIR
     Gentlemen--

  MCKAY
     You gave me no choice! You refused to negotiate!

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, you mean give in.

  MCKAY
     What do you care, anyway? It's not like your
     people are going to use the coal!

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, oh yeah, that's right. You need it to power
     your medieval steam engines!

  MCKAY
     We--

  WEIR
     (standing, furious) Stop it! These are not your
     lands! This "game" is over, so you'd better set
     aside your differences. Because if the two of you
     can't figure out how to forge a truce, how the
     hell are these people going to?

  ZELENKA
     (over radio) Rodney?

  MCKAY
     (peeved, into radio) What?!

  ZELENKA
     (over radio) You'd better come to the game room.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, McKay and Sheppard join Zelenka in the room.

  WEIR
     What happened?

  ZELENKA
     We've just received a data stream from the planet.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sits at a terminal. It shows several
     Hallona troops descending on Geldar people at the
     mine entrance.

  ZELENKA
     Colonel Sheppard's army has launched an attack.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Weir glare at Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     (innocent) Well don't look at me! I didn't order
     it!

  ANNOTATION
     As McKay studies his screen, the red Geldar people
     retreat. The blue Hallonans surround the mine
     entrance.

  MCKAY
     Oh, they're going after the mine!

  WEIR
     Well...looks like your war just started.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Nola and Baden, with their security escort, have
     now joined the others.

  SHEPPARD
     Who ordered this?

  BADEN
     I did.

  MCKAY
     He entered the command on your game console.

  BADEN
     I only did it because I know it was something you
     would've told me to do.

  SHEPPARD
     I ordered you to make peace with these people!

  NOLA
     This attack will not go unpunished!

  WEIR
     No one is doing any punishing! There'll be no
     further escalation to this conflict.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay studies the display.

  MCKAY
     Well, there's no casualties reported. Looks like
     the mine was surrendered without a fight.

  BADEN
     I told my army to minimize collateral damage.

  WEIR
     You need to get back there. Take Ronon and Teyla
     with you. Go to your respective countries, and
     make sure this does not get any further out of
     hand. No one has been hurt yet; let's keep it that
     way.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT



LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Nola, McKay and Ronon hurry down the steps.

  HELKIN
     You're back. We were beginning to worry.

  NOLA
     What's the status?

  HELKIN
     I've ordered three army units to retake the mine.
     They're on their way.

  MCKAY
     Oh, no. No-no-no. You need to put a stop to that.

  NOLA
     Why?

  MCKAY
     Look, we just need to step back and reassess the
     situation here, okay? We should be thinking about
     easing tensions, not inflaming them!

  NOLA
     Oh, no. They're continuing to advance.

  MCKAY
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Ronon study the computer display, which
     shows the Hallona troops leaving the mine and
     advancing towards the advancing Geldar forces.

  NOLA
     (to Helkin) Divert the units away from the mine.
     Have them gather in the village. Prepare to defend
     it.

  RONON
     (low to McKay) Isn't this what you're supposed to
     be stopping?

  MCKAY
     Yes. Look, listen to me, you cannot engage them!

  NOLA
     We must protect our people!

  MCKAY
     Look, I agree, but you've got to give Sheppard
     some time. He'll call off the army.

  NOLA
     (fiercely, skeptical) Will he?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs and moves away from the panel.


LOCATION--HALLONA VILLAGE HEADQUARTERS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stands in a doorway. Teyla stands inside.
     Baden is with his people by their own Oracle
     station.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Sheppard, come in.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Go ahead.

  MCKAY
     (over radio, nervous) Are you watching what's
     going on here?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) No, we just got here. Pretty much the
     same set up as yours. We don't have electricity,
     but I'm not gonna get into that right now.

  MCKAY
     (into radio, impatient) Your army is still on the
     march!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard hurries over to Baden and the control
     station.

  SHEPPARD
     What?!

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Look, they're headed to one of my
     villages. You need to call them off before they--

  TEYLA
     The attack has begun.

  ANNOTATION
     They watch as Baden's forces take over the Geldar
     village. The Geldar forces retreat again.


LOCATION--GELAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon, Nola, and McKay watch the same thing from
     their terminal.

  RONON
     Looks like your guys are giving up.

  MCKAY
     What? No-no-no-no. That can't be right.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) That was fast, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Well, they retreated without any kind of a fight.
     What kind of army is that?

  RONON
     (shrugging) Well, at least there's no casualties.

  NOLA
     It's all right. I have another plan.

  ANNOTATION
     Nola leaves.

  MCKAY
     What other plan?

  RONON
     Why are you asking me?

  MCKAY
     Well...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay takes off after Nola.


LOCATION--GELAR HALLWAY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay finds Nola looking over parchment with
     Helkin.

  MCKAY
     Uh...what are you doing?

  NOLA
     Preparing our counterattack.

  MCKAY
     What counterattack?

  HELKIN
     From...information you gave us about high
     temperature and energetic materials technology, I
     have constructed a tactical explosive device.

  MCKAY
     Wait...a bomb? You actually built a bomb?!

  NOLA
     I told you we'd always be several steps ahead of
     Baden.

  MCKAY
     How come I didn't know about this?

  NOLA
     We have yet to test it, so it still appears to not
     exist.

  HELKIN
     We will target one of Hallona's outlying villages.

  MCKAY
     How are you going to deliver it, huh? I mean,
     the-the catapult couldn't possibly reach that far.

  HELKIN
     I will deliver it.

  NOLA
     Using one of the airships you taught us to build.
     (to Helkin) Go.

  ANNOTATION
     Helkin nods and leaves, taking the plans.

  MCKAY
     Oh, no. No-no-no-no-no. Come back!


LOCATION--HALLONA VILLAGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla step out of headquarters,
     looking worried.

  SHEPPARD
     (furious, low into radio) You taught them how to
     build a bomb?!

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between Geldar and
     Hallona.

  MCKAY
     No! I mean...not specifically. Look...okay...maybe
     I provided them with the list of
     ingredients...but...

  SHEPPARD
     Gah! I don't believe this!

  TEYLA
     How much damage can it cause?

  MCKAY
     Enough to take out an entire village?

  TEYLA
     (panicked) Well, then you must tell them to stop!

  MCKAY
     I tried that! It's already on the way!

  SHEPPARD
     How are they delivering it?

  MCKAY
     (weakly) Dirigible?

  SHEPPARD
     You just had to cheat, didn't you!

  MCKAY
     I did not cheat! Look, nowhere in the rules did it
     specifically outlaw the development of flying
     machines, only the...degree and speed of
     technological advancement.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, they advanced pretty damn fast, didn't
     they!?

  TEYLA
     Do we still have time to shoot it down?

  MCKAY
     (checking watch) Yes. Yes, I think so.

  TEYLA
     Then we'd better get moving.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla leave.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir enters the room. Zelenka and Lorne are
     arguing animatedly across the two opposing
     computer terminals. They have not noticed her
     presence.

  ZELENKA
     Absurd!

  LORNE
     What are you talking about? It's a personally
     reasonable request.

  ZELENKA
     (sarcastic) Oh, yeah. Perfectly reasonable. I give
     you all of my food, and my people starve.

  LORNE
     (talking over Zelenka) I am not asking you for all
     your food!

  ZELENKA
     (talking over Lorne) Yeah, that's perfectly
     reasonable to me, all right.

  LORNE
     I did say that we would make a deal.

  ZELENKA
     (scoffing) A deal. Oh yeah, baskets.

  LORNE
     Big baskets! Two dozen of them, hand woven, and
     very nice!

  ZELENKA
     Oh very nice? What am I going to put in them, huh?
     Certainly not food!

  LORNE
     You know what? I think you're holding out on me. I
     think you have plenty of food.

  ZELENKA
     Are you calling me a liar?

  LORNE
     No, I think you're trying to squeeze me for a
     better deal. That's what I think!

  ZELENKA
     Ach! I have got nothing to hide! Now I--

  LORNE
     Okay, okay, then maybe I should send some of my
     army troops down, and we'll have a look, then.

  WEIR
     (shouting) What the hell are you two doing?!

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne straightens to parade rest. Zelenka stares,
     mouth agape.

  WEIR
     I thought I gave specific orders to stay away from
     this device?

  ZELENKA
     (abashed) Yes, yes you did.

  LORNE
     (contrite) We just saw that there was
     some...people in trouble, and we thought maybe
     that we could...uh...help.

  ANNOTATION
     He exchanges looks with Zelenka.

  WEIR
     No! No more help. Clearly, we are not qualified.
     Now, turn this thing off, disconnect the power,
     and seal the room.

  ZELENKA
     Yeah, okay, but we...

  WEIR
     (firmly) Now.

  LORNE
     Yes, ma'am.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir leaves as Lorne and Zelenka type commands
     into the keyboard, shutting down the system.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Ronon, Nola and others stare at the
     terminal display. Some sort of timer is ticking.

  NOLA
     I'd hoped you would be proud of our
     accomplishments.

  MCKAY
     (upset) I am. Really, I just-I wish it didn't lead
     to this.


LOCATION--M4D-058, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper flies across the sky.


LOCATION--GELDAR CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The display shows a new ship (the jumper) on the
     screen.

  GARTH
     What's that?

  ANNOTATION
     Nola looks to McKay, who exchanges an awkward look
     with Ronon.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     There it is.

  ANNOTATION
     They can see the dirigible in the distance through
     the window.

  TEYLA
     Good. Now all you have to do is puncture the
     balloon.

  SHEPPARD
     Already on it.


LOCATION--M4D-058, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper fires a single drone which strikes at
     the center of the balloon.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     The display shows the jumper firing and striking
     the dirigible.

  NOLA
     Colonel Sheppard! He shot down our airship with
     the puddle jumper!

  ANNOTATION
     She looks accusingly at McKay.

  RONON
     Yeah, don't worry, no one was hurt.

  MCKAY
     He-he just...punctured it. It sank harmlessly to
     the ground.

  NOLA
     (to Garth) Prepare the other bombs for delivery.

  RONON
     Other bombs?

  MCKAY
     What, you have more?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and McKay exchange looks.

  RONON
     (sarcastic) Great.


LOCATION--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla return to the headquarters.
     Baden looks chastened.

  BADEN
     Thank you for your help. You saved the lives of
     everyone in that village.

  SHEPPARD
     We won't be doing that again.

  BADEN
     I had no idea they were capable of delivering such
     a device.

  SHEPPARD
     (with sidelong glance at Teyla) Tell me about it.

  BADEN
     I've issued orders to make certain they don't try
     again.

  SHEPPARD
     (suspicious) What kind of orders?

  BADEN
     A full-scale attack has been launched. It's time
     to finish this war.

  ANNOTATION
     They watch the terminal screen as Baden's forces
     start to invade Geldar.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Nola and Garth study plans. Ronon and McKay stand
     on the staircase balcony above.

  RONON
     I've seen this before. If two sides are dead set
     on fighting, nothing's going to stop them.

  MCKAY
     So I gotta get Nola to call off the attack.

  RONON
     (scoffing) You couldn't do it before. What makes
     you think you can now?

  MCKAY
     How about a little encouragement, huh? You know, a
     "go get 'em, Rodney? I have faith in you?"

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon stares at McKay.

  MCKAY
     Okay, whatever. Look, I am not giving up on these
     people. Which means until we get them to call this
     war off, then we are staying put right here!

  ANNOTATION
     The pair are beamed away.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Daedalus is in orbit above M4D-058.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and McKay are beamed into a corridor.
     Sheppard and Teyla are already aboard and heading
     down the corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     We could use your help. Come on!

  MCKAY
     Whoa-whoa-whoa! What the hell's going on?

  SHEPPARD
     Elizabeth diverted the Daedalus on its way back to
     Earth to check up on us.

  TEYLA
     Colonel Caldwell believed that the situation had
     deteriorated. He feared that we would become
     casualties of war and so, beamed us out.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but, I talked him into beaming us back, but
     we gotta do something first, so come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard grabs McKay by his tactical vest and
     drags him along. They start heading down the
     corridor.

  MCKAY
     Wha--do what?

  SHEPPARD
     I got a plan.

  MCKAY
     What plan?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, come on, already.

  TEYLA
     (to Ronon) How's the situation on your end?

  RONON
     All out war. You?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla sighs.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Garth watches the display. Ronon and McKay walk
     down the steps.

  NOLA
     Where did you go? What happened?

  MCKAY
     Uh...nowhere? No, we were just upstairs.

  NOLA
     Someone said you vanished into thin air.

  MCKAY
     What? No. That's ridiculous. How could we vanish?

  GARTH
     The airships have passed the southern forests.
     They're nearing their targets.

  NOLA
     That's hope we strike first, before Baden's army
     reaches our villages. We'll destroy their will to
     fight.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay grabs Nola by the shoulders.

  MCKAY
     (fiercely) Okay, listen to me! For two years now,
     I have been the Oracle to your people. I have
     given you much wisdom and guidance and-and
     bestowed much of my knowledge. Look, it's like you
     said, I was a god!

  RONON
     (low, warning) Easy...

  MCKAY
     And yes, yes, I may just be a man, but that wisdom
     still remains! And now, more than ever, you need
     to heed my guidance and call back those ships!

  NOLA
     (troubled) You told me it was time to start
     thinking on my own.

  MCKAY
     Right...?

  NOLA
     So now I am. My people are looking to me. This is
     my decision. And we will be victorious.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Ronon sigh and exchange looks.


LOCATION--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Baden watches the dirigibles approach his villages
     and moves restlessly. Sheppard and Teyla are with
     him.

  BADEN
     Why won't you help us?!

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not shooting down any more ships. We're done
     helping you wage this war.

  BADEN
     Then we'll shoot them down ourselves.

  TEYLA
     How?

  ANNOTATION
     Baden nods to an aide, who leaves.

  BADEN
     Our weapons are not as primitive as Nola believes.

  TEYLA
     Many people will die on both sides.

  BADEN
     If you want to leave, then leave! We'll continue
     this fight even if you've lost the will.

  SHEPPARD
     You're making a big mistake...

  BADEN
     The only mistake was not doing this sooner! You'll
     see. This is the right path for my people.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Sheppard exchange looks.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Nola studies the terminal display.

  NOLA
     They've reached our villages.

  GARTH
     Two have already fallen.

  NOLA
     Airships are almost in position. We should--

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm interrupts her. One of the airships
     disappears from the screen.

  NOLA
     What happened?

  MCKAY
     They shot down one of your ships! (protesting) It
     wasn't the puddle jumper.

  RONON
     Maybe one of the catapults hit it.

  NOLA
     No! Impossible!

  ANNOTATION
     They watch as the last of the airships is
     destroyed. Further south on the display,
     explosions rock the Geldar villages.

  GARTH
     Two more villages have fallen. It appears many are
     dead.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Sheppard, come in! Sheppard! (to
     others) The radio's dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Explosions are heard in the distance.

  NOLA
     They're coming here...

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone races outside.


LOCATION--GELDAR, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     People run, panicked, through the streets. McKay,
     Nola, and Ronon run outside.

  MCKAY
     What, they have bombs, too?

  RONON
     (to Nola) We need to get your people out of here,
     now!

  MCKAY
     (to Ronon) Help them!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon runs to help in the evacuation. McKay joins
     Nola back inside.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Nola are back with Garth. The explosions
     are closer.

  GARTH
     Their army has surrounded us.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon comes back in.

  RONON
     The road out of the village is blocked. People are
     being slaughtered as they try to leave.

  MCKAY
     We're trapped!

  ANNOTATION
     The power on the Oracle terminal dies.

  GARTH
     What shall we do?

  NOLA
     (defeated) It's over.


LOCATION--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Explosions rock Hallona as well as Sheppard and
     Baden watch the terminal screen.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Rodney, where the hell are you?

  BELEN
     They've dropped another bomb! Hundreds have died!
     How can you stand by and let this happen?!

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla runs in.

  TEYLA
     Nola's army has surrounded the village.

  SHEPPARD
     Can we get to the jumper?

  TEYLA
     They've just destroyed it.

  ANNOTATION
     Baden watches the terminal as his villages are
     being obliterated.

  BADEN
     We're being overwhelmed.

  TEYLA
     What should we do?

  ANNOTATION
     The Oracle terminal loses power. The explosions
     stop. Baden looks around, then stares at Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     Game over.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Rodney, you there?

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Yeah. We hear you. We'll give you a
     call when we're ready to be picked up.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Got it.

  NOLA
     I don't understand. What's going on?


LOCATION--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

  SHEPPARD
     (to Baden) What you just witnessed is what I would
     call is another level to the game.


LOCATION--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     The conversations switch between McKay & Ronon
     talking to Nola and Sheppard & Teyla talking to
     Baden.

  MCKAY
     See, we were beamed up earlier to our ship, the
     Daedalus, in...orbit over your planet.

  SHEPPARD
     While we were there, I had Doctor McKay hack into
     the two devices, upload doomsday scenarios for
     each of your countries into the game.

  TEYLA
     Everything you saw just now was transmitted from
     the Daedalus.

  BADEN
     You mean...none of this was real?

  MCKAY
     No, no one was hurt, no one was killed--all just
     part of the simulation.

  RONON
     In reality, your two armies are standing down,
     awaiting further instructions.

  NOLA
     But we heard explosions! We felt them!

  SHEPPARD
     Thanks to some...pinpoint shots from our friends
     in the Daedalus. It really added to the realism,
     didn't it?

  MCKAY
     (sighing) I'm sorry that we had to do that. But
     you needed to see how this could end.

  RONON
     Feel what a real war is like.

  SHEPPARD
     You still think it was the right path for your
     people?

  ANNOTATION
     Nola and Baden each look troubled at what they've
     learned.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Weir walks in with a female scientist.

  WEIR
     Thanks, Melanie.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir grabs a bottled water. She notices McKay and
     Sheppard playing chess at a table.

  WEIR
     Gentlemen...

  SHEPPARD
     How's it going?

  WEIR
     Eh, it's still going. I'm just taking a break.
     There's a lot of animosity to be unraveled, but I
     think they are finally willing to at least try to
     make it work.

  MCKAY
     Well, it's about time.

  WEIR
     Yeah. And you two? Called a truce yet?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Sure. We're-we're good.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, don't worry, we're going to stick to Chess
     from now on.

  SHEPPARD
     As long as Rodney doesn't cheat.

  MCKAY
     Oh, please. Like I need to cheat playing you?

  WEIR
     Okay, I'll leave you to it, then.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay moves his knight.

  MCKAY
     Hah!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard moves his rook, taking McKay's pawn, and
     leaving his king unprotected.

  SHEPPARD
     "Hah!" Checkmate.

  MCKAY
     What? Wh-wh-whoa, no-no-no-no. What happened
     there?

  SHEPPARD
     What happened there is I just kicked your ass.

  MCKAY
     No, no, I was distracted. She was...Okay, we're
     going again. Best of ten.

  ANNOTATION
     He proceeds to reset the chess board to start
     another game.
