<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>BECKETT: Hmm...not really.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>MCKAY: Actually, I was talking to the mouse, but now you mention it, some of those Athosian women are pretty hot, and we did just save them from the Wraith, so we've got to trade on that while you can, you know, before they discover we're not actually that cool.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: McKay runs over and leaps onto the bed, rolling up the sleeve on his left arm. Beckett rolls up his right arm instead and preps it for an injection.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>BECKETT: I'm surprised you're so eager to volunteer for this, Rodney.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>MCKAY: Well, you know me, always eager to help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>BECKETT: (dubious) Right. So do you have any questions about the process? I mean, you are a scientist.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>MCKAY: Uh, yeah. I'm sorry, medicine is about as much of a science as is, oh, I don't know, voodoo. All I need to know is that will enable me to use Ancient technology like Major Sheppard, or yourself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Beckett taps McKay's arm to get a vein, probably somewhat harder than necessary as he glares at McKay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>BECKETT: We believe A.T.A., or Ancient Technology Activation, is caused by a single gene that's always on, instructing various cells in the body to produce a series of proteins and enzymes that interact with the skin, the nervous system, and the brain. In this case, we're using a mouse retrovirus to deliver the missing gene to your cells.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>GRODIN: It seems some Ancient technology requires the user to have the gene. Other things merely require initialization. Once activated, like the control room, anyone can push the buttons to make them work.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>MCKAY: Look, Beckett's gene therapy worked. I was able to activate this. It's a, uh, personal shield, acts like a, uh, protective skin, and it must have inertial dampening properties, too, because I didn't feel a thing. Watch this. (to Grodin) Hit me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Grodin tries to punch McKay in the face. A few inches away, his fist strikes a green energy field, knocking him back.</td></tr>

<tr id="L122"><td><a href="#L122">122</a></td><td>BECKETT: So he likes to tell us. Listen, I feel terrible. It's possible this was a result of artificially imposing the gene.</td></tr>

<tr id="L133"><td><a href="#L133">133</a></td><td>BECKETT: You think when it comes down to it, the shield will just shut itself down?</td></tr>

<tr id="L134"><td><a href="#L134">134</a></td><td>WEIR: The Ancients were smart enough to build fail-safes into their other technology. I mean, this entire city, it rose from the deep of the ocean when danger was imminent. Why would they design a personal shield that could kill you?</td></tr>
