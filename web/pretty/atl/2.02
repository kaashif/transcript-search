<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: (pouring himself a cup of coffee) Couldn't sleep. Must be the burden of command.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He takes a seat across from her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>WEIR: All right, John, it's been almost a month. When are you going to stop trying to find a way to bring that up in every single conversation?</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: You've got to understand. There's a lot of people in the air force who never thought I'd make it past captain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>WEIR: Well, obviously, the people whose opinions matter the most thought otherwise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Well, McKay says we're already at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy. You'll be fine once we get back to Atlantis. You know, it's funny. I spent the past year wondering if I'd ever see Earth again, and as soon as I got there...</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>WEIR: I know how you feel. God, it was extremely convenient to be able to step through the gate and be at Stargate Command in an instant, and now this... It feels extremely inconvenient having to spend 18 days cooped up on this ship to get back.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Until we find another ZPM to power the Earth gate, that's just the way it's going to have to be.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>CALDWELL: There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill anyone. Doctor?</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>BECKETT: I'll know more once I've had a chance to examine the body more thoroughly.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>WEIR: What happened there?</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>MCKAY: I don't know. It's a camera malfunction.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Right before he was killed? Interesting coincidence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>MCKAY: Actually, I think it makes sense. Look, Colonel Caldwell was right. There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill someone, at least not normally.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>WEIR: What are you thinking?</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>MCKAY: It's possible there was some sort of isolated power surge in this section. That would explain the lost camera, the malfunctioning door.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>CALDWELL: So when the door controls didn't respond, he took out the panel to bypass the circuits and received a fatal jolt?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>MCKAY: Well, like I said, it's possible. Look, I recommend we drop out of hyperspace, run a full diagnostic on the power distribution systems.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>CALDWELL: No, we drop out now, we risk being detected.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>WEIR: Now that we have a ZPM, the city can support a much larger contingent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>CALDWELL: Of course, it's our feeling that a correspondent increase in military presence would also be prudent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>WEIR: I agree. That's why I wanted Major Sheppard to come back with me. In fact, I brought all my senior staff back. I think it's only fair that they participate in the selection process of the new personnel in their respective departments.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Landry gets up from the table and crosses the room.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>LANDRY: That's kind of what we wanted to talk to you about. In your report, you singled Major Sheppard out for a lot of credit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>LANDRY: (pouring himself a cup of coffee) You were also candid enough to document several occasions in which you and the major didn't exactly see eye to eye. In particular, there was an incident involving an alien nanovirus in which Major Sheppard directly disobeyed one of your orders.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>WEIR: He also saved a lot of lives that day.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>LANDRY: Well... the Major's courage and ingenuity are not in question here. His ability to follow the proper chain of command is.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>CALDWELL: But you are the leader of the expedition.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>LANDRY: You see, Doctor, from our point of view, Major Sheppard's independent nature poses a bit of a problem. If he can disobey you, he may see fit to do the same to the new commander of the military contingent on Atlantis.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>WEIR: (coldly) Excuse me? And when did this happen?</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>LANDRY: Of course, the decision hasn't been made yet, but we do have a candidate in mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Weir lets out a breath and looks at Caldwell, who gives a small nod.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>WEIR: (firmly) Atlantis has a military commander.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>LANDRY: You had a military commander. Colonel Sumner. When he was killed, Major Sheppard correctly assumed the position until a proper replacement could be brought in.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>CALDWELL: Doctor, you can't be suggesting that a mission of this importance be trusted to a major. And one with a questionable record, at that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>WEIR: (to Landry) Major Sheppard's record before he joined my team doesn't concern me. All I can tell you is that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. And as for his rank... (Caldwell smiles incredulously) Well, if that's not good enough for you, you're just going to have to promote him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>LANDRY: Doctor...</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>WEIR: I shouldn't have to remind you gentlemen that I continue to have the support of the president and our foreign allies. You don't want to fight me on this one.</td></tr>
