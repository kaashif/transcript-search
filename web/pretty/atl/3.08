McKay And Mrs. Miller
TEASER

LOCATION--LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Toys and stuffed animals are scattered everywhere.
     Four year old Madison plays with a train set.
     Jeanie is crouched near her.

  MADISON
     The princess is going to play.

  JEANIE
     Where's the princess? Where's the princess in the
     tower?

  MADISON
     Right there.

  JEANIE
     Which one? Oh.

  MADISON
     Put this one...

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie starts moving the train while Madison moves
     a dragon.

  JEANIE
     This is how they get around, right? Chugga-chugga.
     Chugga-chugga.

  ANNOTATION
     Madison puts the dragon in a building and starts
     pushing the train herself.

  MADISON
     Go inside the train. Choo choo. Choo choo.
     Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie watches the train go over the bridge in the
     playset. Inspiration hits her. She pulls off a
     picture of a house from Madison's drawing pad and
     then starts to write in finger paints.

  ANNOTATION
     Miller enters the home and puts down his
     briefcase.

  MILLER
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     He sees Madison standing transfixed at the edge of
     the living room.

  MILLER
     Madison?


LOCATION--LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Madison doesn't answer, so he goes over and
     crouches next to her.

  MILLER
     Honey?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns and looks at what Madison is staring at.
     The living room is scattered with pages of filled
     with finger painted physics equations. His wife is
     in the center of them, still writing, oblivious to
     all.

  MILLER
     Hi...?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie starts.

  JEANIE
     Oh! Hey!

  MILLER
     (nonplussed) So...how was your day?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie looks around the room at all her drawings,
     seeming to notice them for the first time.


LOCATION--MILLER HOME, VANCOUVER, B.C., CANADA, NIGHT


LOCATION--MASTER BEDROOM, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Miller and Jeanie get ready for bed.

  MILLER
     Send it to Graeme Peel.

  JEANIE
     Graeme Peel has better things to do than to do
     than look over my nonsensical scribblings.

  MILLER
     Well, they didn't look nonsensical to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie gives him a look. He grins.

  MILLER
     Okay, fine, they did. But I'm an English major.
     What the hell do I know? Send it. What have you
     got to lose.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him.

  JEANIE
     Good night.

  MILLER
     G'Nite.

  ANNOTATION
     They turn out the lights, but Jeanie lies with her
     eyes wide open.


LOCATION--KITCHEN, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie sits at the table refining the calculations
     with pen and paper.


LOCATION--LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Miller juggles some beverages into the living
     room, where Jeanie and Madison play by the train
     table. There is a knock at the door. Jeanie gets
     up to answer it.


LOCATION--FOYER, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     She opens the door to find Carter and two Air
     Force officers standing outside. All are in Class
     A uniform.

  CARTER
     (smiling) Jean Miller?

  JEANIE
     (cautiously) Yes?

  CARTER
     Hi, I'm Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter of the
     United States Air Force.

  JEANIE
     Okay?

  CARTER
     Did you send a math proof to Professor Graeme Peel
     of the California Institute of Technology?

  JEANIE
     (nervous) Was I not supposed to?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--SCIENCE LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Zelenka work on their laptops. Sheppard
     enters.

  SHEPPARD
     Sorry to interrupt, kids, but you need to pack
     your toothbrush. Head back to Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     He points to McKay.

  MCKAY
     I do? Why?

  SHEPPARD
     Carter needs help.

  MCKAY
     (preening) Ah. With what?

  SHEPPARD
     Your sister.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's expression turns serious.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters to greet McKay coming through the
     wormhole.

  CARTER
     Welcome back to Earth.

  MCKAY
     Yes, yes. What has my sister done?

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate shuts down.

  CARTER
     (dryly) Good to see you too, McKay.

  MCKAY
     (impatient) Greetings, salutations,
     pleasantries...what's she done?

  ANNOTATION
     He keeps walking out of the room, taking a quick
     look at her backside. Glaring, Carter follows.


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The remains of a sandwich sit nearby while McKay
     reads over the proof. Carter paces, snapping her
     fingers and looking bored. She leans over his
     shoulder.

  CARTER
     I thought that--

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up a finger to silence her. He finishes
     reading and sits back.

  MCKAY
     Huh. Well, it's certainly some...uh...very
     interesting stuff. But uh, huh, it can't be her
     work. I mean, she's been out of the game for
     years.

  CARTER
     "The game?"

  MCKAY
     Mmm, yes. She hasn't published a single
     theoretical physics paper in, like, four years.

  CARTER
     Oh. That game.

  MCKAY
     Mmm. She was on the fast track to some, uh, pretty
     exciting grants, doing some interesting work. I
     mean, she was no me, of course. But, uh, she was
     at least a "you."

  CARTER
     (unimpressed) Uh-huh.

  MCKAY
     Mmm. Anyway...she got herself knocked up by
     some..."English major", and her priorities shifted
     overnight. Tried to talk some sense into her, but,
     uh, she's a tad on the stubborn side.

  CARTER
     When was the last time you spoke to her?

  MCKAY
     Mmm, four years, maybe.

  CARTER
     Four years?!

  MCKAY
     (defensively) Not that I didn't check to see if
     she'd published!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter huffs in disbelief.

  CARTER
     You realize what this proof means, right?

  MCKAY
     (chuckles) Yes, well, if the math checks out.

  CARTER
     Oh I've been over it. It checks out.

  MCKAY
     Ah, well, no offense, blue eyes, but, um, I'd like
     a little more time with it, myself.

  CARTER
     (firmly) It checks out.

  MCKAY
     (jealous) Aw, and she said it just came to her?

  CARTER
     Yeah. She was playing with her kid, and she got a
     notion.

  MCKAY
     A notion. That is just beautiful. She's gonna love
     this...wait, you didn't tell her I've been trying
     to prove something like this myself, did you?

  CARTER
     Not exactly.

  MCKAY
     Oh, good. Because she would just...wait a minute.
     Why not?

  CARTER
     See, that's part of the reason I asked you here.
     She's been cleared by the Pentagon, but she
     refuses to sign the confidentiality agreement. She
     says she wants nothing to do with us. To be
     honest, she's been a bit of a pain in the ass.

  MCKAY
     Huh. Well, forget her, then. I mean, she's made
     her choice, we'll just have to you and I figure
     out how to implement it on our own. Let's
     see...Now, upon first glance, there are certainly
     some...missing pieces that aren't exactly spelled
     out in the proof, but um...What?

  ANNOTATION
     While he's been speaking, McKay shifts more
     uncomfortably under Carter's steady gaze.

  CARTER
     You and I both know this would go a lot faster if
     your sister were on board.

  MCKAY
     Well, what do you want me to do? She's not gonna
     listen to me!

  CARTER
     You're her brother!

  MCKAY
     Exactly!


LOCATION--FOYER, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     There is a knock at the door. Jeanie answers to
     find McKay standing there with a bouquet of
     flowers.

  MCKAY
     Hi.

  JEANIE
     (surprised) Hi.

  MCKAY
     Long time no see?

  JEANIE
     To say the least.

  ANNOTATION
     There is an awkward silence.

  MCKAY
     Aren't you going to invite me in?

  JEANIE
     Why are you here?

  MCKAY
     Oh, I can't just stop by, say hi to my little
     sister?

  JEANIE
     Well, we haven't spoken in four years, and you've
     never done anything like this! So...no, you can't.

  MCKAY
     Well, I've been kind of...busy...with work...you
     know, doing a lot of traveling, and such, and I-I
     was called back on business, so um...I was in
     town...and-and I thought I'd um...you know, um...

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out the flowers.

  JEANIE
     (suspicious) Wait a second.

  MCKAY
     What?

  JEANIE
     You're not here because of the physics proof, are
     you?

  MCKAY
     (defensively) What? No. No-no I-I mean, I'm sure
     that's part of the reason why I'm here, but, uh--

  JEANIE
     You work for the U.S. government?!

  MCKAY
     No! No, I work for a multi-national...er,
     oversight advisory that, uh...

  JEANIE
     You know what? I don't care. I already told
     that-that colonel person that I don't want
     anything to do with them.

  MCKAY
     Do you have any idea what you've written?

  JEANIE
     A math proof. Some-some theoretical physics. I am
     willing to wager it has no practical application
     at all.

  MCKAY
     I'll take that action.

  JEANIE
     What does that mean?

  MCKAY
     Just sign the damn agreement!

  JEANIE
     No! Getting all proprietary about our research
     and-and ideas is everything that's wrong with
     science today.

  MCKAY
     Here we go.

  JEANIE
     Do you know that one fifth of our genes, the very
     building blocks of our being, have been patented
     by major pharmaceutical corporations? One fifth!
     If there's any benefit at all to what I've
     written, it's that it'll spark an idea in someone
     else. I am not going to sign away my rights, least
     of all to the U.S. military.

  MCKAY
     But it has sparked an idea in someone. A big one!

  JEANIE
     Like what?

  MCKAY
     Ah! Can't tell you. Not until you sign the
     agreement.

  JEANIE
     I'm not signing the agreement until you tell me.

  ANNOTATION
     Miller comes down the hall, carrying Madison.

  MILLER
     Is everything okay?

  JEANIE
     Look who showed up?

  MCKAY
     (awkwardly) Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     Miller looks at McKay without recognition.

  JEANIE
     It's...my brother.

  MILLER
     Oh, right! Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Miller puts down his daughter. Madison comes over
     and hugs McKay's legs.

  MADISON
     Hi.

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Uh, hello, little one.

  MADISON
     Did you bring me a present?

  ANNOTATION
     Miller and Jeanie laugh. Jeanie pulls Madison
     away.

  JEANIE
     (scolding) Madison!

  MCKAY
     What? No. I didn't know that was a rule.

  MADISON
     It is!

  MCKAY
     Well, I guess I broke that rule.

  ANNOTATION
     Madison giggles.

  MILLER
     Uh, I just made some dinner. Would you care to
     join us?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie turns and glares at Miller.

  MCKAY
     Uh, that would be great, exactly. I'm starving.
     You have no idea what time zone I just came from.

  ANNOTATION
     Miller leads Madison into the kitchen.

  MILLER
     Well, I, uh, sure hope you like tofu chicken.

  ANNOTATION
     He chuckles, McKay joins in half-heartedly.

  MCKAY
     (low, to Jeanie) I sure hope he's kidding.

  ANNOTATION
     He passes off the flowers to Jeanie and enters.
     Jeanie sighs.


LOCATION--KITCHEN, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie clear plates from the dining room
     and enter the kitchen.

  JEANIE
     Not a fan of vegetarian cuisine, eh?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay carries his mostly full plate in.

  MCKAY
     (pitifully) Hmm, yes, well...I suppose I was just
     in the mood for, um, well...food.

  ANNOTATION
     Miller enters.

  MILLER
     I'll give Maddie her bath. You two catch up.

  JEANIE
     Okay, hon.

  MILLER
     (to McKay) Hey, pop your head in before you leave.

  MCKAY
     (nervous) What? Uh, why?

  MILLER
     Children like to, uh, say goodbye.

  MCKAY
     Oh! The, uh...uh...sure. Sure.

  ANNOTATION
     Miller leaves. McKay scrapes his plate into the
     trash.

  MCKAY
     Boy, uh, Madison's sure grown, huh?

  JEANIE
     (caustically) Since she was born? Yeah, yeah she
     has.

  MCKAY
     Okay, look I don't want to waste any more of your
     time. You-you need to come with me right now!
     Your-your proof could lead to
     something...groundbreaking!

  JEANIE
     How long would I be gone?

  MCKAY
     Well it's like, a couple months, tops.

  JEANIE
     (laughs in disbelief) A couple of months?! Are you
     joking? I--Madison has her first ballet recital
     next Tuesday.

  MCKAY
     She's four. How good could she possibly be?

  JEANIE
     That's not the point!

  MCKAY
     Hey, she's not gonna remember you not being there.

  JEANIE
     I'll remember me not being there.

  MCKAY
     This is bigger than your-your "responsibilities."

  JEANIE
     Okay, we've, uh, we've had this conversation
     before. Uh, you belittle my choices, I get furious
     at you, and we don't talk for four years. I'm not
     all that anxious to do that again.

  MCKAY
     This is not what dad would've wanted.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie gasps in outrage.

  MCKAY
     No, he would've wanted us working together, side
     by side, toppling problems, and-and sharing
     credit.

  JEANIE
     Oh, uh, you-you share credit now, do you?

  MCKAY
     This is important, Jeanie. I mean, it's much more
     important than you could ever imagine.

  JEANIE
     For you, I am sure it is. But this, me being here,
     this is important for me. Why can't you accept
     that?!

  MCKAY
     You know, you leave me no choice.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay reaches into his pocket and walks over to
     Jeanie.

  JEANIE
     What?

  MCKAY
     Just give me your hand.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie clutches both hands to herself.

  JEANIE
     Why?

  MCKAY
     Please, just give me your hand.

  ANNOTATION
     She reaches out then pulls her hand back.

  MCKAY
     Will you just...?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie finally holds out her hand. McKay grasps it
     and presses the controller in his other hand.


LOCATION--HERMIOD'S LAB, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie beam into the room. Carter is
     already there, working the Asgard controls.

  JEANIE
     (frightened) Uh, okay. Wha-what the hell just
     happened?

  CARTER
     It's okay. You're perfectly safe.

  JEANIE
     (still upset) Uh, I don't feel perfectly safe.

  MCKAY
     Okay, you've just been teleported to an
     interstellar vessel in orbit above the planet.

  JEANIE
     (scoffing) Please. Teleportation is about as
     likely as time travel.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay exchange awkward looks.

  MCKAY
     Hmm, yes, well...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns Jeanie around to have her look out the
     window. She sees Earth below her.

  JEANIE
     Oh...my.

  MCKAY
     Oh, yes.

  JEANIE
     Is-is that...? Why aren't we weightless?

  CARTER
     Artificial gravity. And yes, that is North
     America, and you are in geosynchronous orbit.

  MCKAY
     We work for something called the Stargate Program.

  JEANIE
     Stargate?

  MCKAY
     Uh, it's a device that, uh, creates stable
     artificial wormholes that allows us to travel
     between other planets, even...other galaxies.

  JEANIE
     What have you gotten yourself involved in here,
     Meredith?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay groans. Carter turns to him, alert.

  CARTER
     Meredith?

  MCKAY
     It's a long story.

  JEANIE
     It's his name.

  CARTER
     (fighting not to laugh) Your name is Meredith
     McKay?

  MCKAY
     It's Meredith Rodney McKay, yes. But I prefer to
     go by "Rodney." Look, can we just stick to the
     point here? Look out the window--much more
     interesting than my name.

  CARTER
     Your name is Meredith?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie finally turns away from the window and
     walks around, gesturing wildly.

  JEANIE
     So, this-this is like a...like a spaceship?

  CARTER
     This is a U.S. Air Force vessel called the
     Daedalus.

  MCKAY
     Your equation has real world applications I'm
     certain you've never even considered.

  CARTER
     You see, there are some...very bad creatures out
     there that want nothing more but to destroy this
     planet and everything that you hold dear.

  JEANIE
     Uh, did you say "creatures"? Like...like alien
     creatures?

  CARTER
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie walks back over to the window.

  MCKAY
     Look, the work we could do is important, Jeanie.
     Not just to you or me, but to every living being
     down there, and that includes Madison and,
     um,...uh...

  JEANIE
     Kaleb.

  MCKAY
     Kaleb, yes.

  CARTER
     We can't do this without you.

  MCKAY
     Let's not go overboard. I mean, she'd be an asset,
     but--

  CARTER
     (admonishing) McKay! (to Jeanie) So what do you
     say, Mrs. Miller?

  MCKAY
     Jeanie...

  JEANIE
     Look, it's just a lot to take in right now, okay?
     Just give me a second, Mer.

  ANNOTATION
     She stares out the window for a few moments.

  JEANIE
     So, somewhere down there, my husband is giving my
     daughter a bath.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay smile.


LOCATION--MASTER BEDROOM, MILLER HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Miller awakens in bed. He looks over to see Jeanie
     sitting at the edge of the bed.

  MILLER
     You have to go.

  JEANIE
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     She sighs.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus leaves Earth orbit and jumps into
     hyperspace.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie walk down the corridor, passing
     other personnel.

  MCKAY
     What did you tell Kaleb?

  JEANIE
     The truth?

  MCKAY
     What?! Do you have any idea what "non-disclosure"
     means?

  JEANIE
     Just because we don't keep secrets from each other
     doesn't mean we're incapable of it.

  MCKAY
     Well, what did he say?

  JEANIE
     (chuckles) Um, he's concerned that me telling him
     will get him assassinated. (notices her brother
     not laughing) That-that won't happen, right?

  MCKAY
     Mmm. Probably not.


LOCATION--LAB, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie sit by a large monitor. Carter is
     on the monitor screen.

  CARTER
     (over vidlink) Again, I'm sorry I couldn't come
     with you, but there's just too much going on here.

  MCKAY
     It's fine.

  CARTER
     Well, I thought I could at least help you get
     Jeanie up to speed before you guys are out of comm
     range. About a year ago, your brother came across
     an abandoned alien experiment called Project
     Arcturus. It was an attempt to generate zero point
     energy.

  JEANIE
     That would be virtually limitless power! What
     happened?

  MCKAY
     A slight problem. It was the creation of exotic
     particles in the containment field.

  CARTER
     He destroyed a solar system.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie smacks her brother.

  JEANIE
     Meredith!

  MCKAY
     It was uninhabited.

  CARTER
     Your brother along with many others has been
     trying to figure out a way to draw zero point
     energy from a parallel space-time.

  MCKAY
     Which would get us around the whole problem of the
     creation of dangerous exotic particles in our own
     space-time.

  JEANIE
     And my theory is about bridging universes.

  CARTER
     Exactly. Yeah, we're hoping to use your proof as a
     theoretical basis for building a bridge from a
     parallel space-time to ours.

  JEANIE
     Uh, the energy you'd need would be enormous to the
     point of absurd.

  MCKAY
     Absurd we can do. We have something called a zero
     point module which essentially does what we're
     attempting on a smaller scale--extract energy from
     subspace time.

  JEANIE
     So...subspace is real?

  CARTER
     You're flying in it.

  JEANIE
     Oh. Aren't you worried about the exotic particles
     crossing back over my bridge?

  CARTER
     Well, that's the beauty of your theory. It should
     not only allow us to build a bridge, it should
     also allow us to manage the flow rate of energy.

  JEANIE
     Like...a faucet.

  MCKAY
     (chuckling) Well, something like that.

  CARTER
     (annoyed) It's exactly like that.

  JEANIE
     What about the parallel universe? Aren't you just
     shifting the exotic particle problem to their
     side?

  CARTER
     Potentially. But when you consider that the number
     of possible parallel universes that we could
     access borders on the infinite, the odds of us
     choosing at random one that's inhabited
     are...astronomically slim.

  JEANIE
     Huh. Wow.

  CARTER
     I know. It's an awful lot to take in at once.

  JEANIE
     (smug, to McKay) I solved your problem in my spare
     time...with finger paints.

  MCKAY
     Here we go.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter suppresses a grin.

  JEANIE
     I just can't imagine how you're "surviving" the
     humiliation.

  MCKAY
     Look, if it wasn't for my work, your little theory
     would be useless.

  CARTER
     Whoa, whoa! Siblings, please!

  MCKAY AND JEANIE
     Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is even less successful at hiding her
     amusement. They both notice.

  MCKAY
     What?

  CARTER
     Well, it's just that you both said "sorry" in that
     cute little Canadian way, and I...

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie and McKay exchange looks.

  CARTER
     Sorry. Touch base when you get back to Atlantis.
     Good luck.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter's transmission ends. Jeanie and McKay get
     up and leave.

  JEANIE
     These alien creatures must be quite the threat for
     you to even try what you're doing.

  MCKAY
     I don't want to scare you, but you need to know
     the stakes. We're at war.

  JEANIE
     Did you start it?

  MCKAY
     What?! No! Come on!

  JEANIE
     Well...


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus flies through hyperspace.


LOCATION--CONFERENCE ROOM, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie stares at the hyperspace flash through the
     window. McKay sits at the table looking at papers.

  MCKAY
     Okay, you've got a nota bene by the cosmological
     constant. Why is that? Jeanie?

  ANNOTATION
     She doesn't notice. He gets up and snaps his
     fingers in front of her face. She turns.

  MCKAY
     Hey. Yeah. Why you're here, remember?

  JEANIE
     Yeah.

  MCKAY
     Thank you.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie and McKay step out of an elevator. She
     carries a tablet computer, while he has pages of
     printouts.

  MCKAY
     (pointing on page) So there's your problem, right
     there.

  JEANIE
     (points to tablet) What are you talking about?
     It's here. And you made a mistake.

  MCKAY
     No I didn't!


LOCATION--HERMIOD'S LAB, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay points to a monitor display and looks at
     Hermiod.

  MCKAY
     Okay, so we need a yea or nay on the equations.

  HERMIOD
     (nodding assent) Yea.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie gapes at the alien.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka wanders the lab and comes to a monitor
     that beeps. He receives a message downloaded from
     Dr. McKay from the Daedalus. It is several
     schematics for the device. Zelenka stares at them
     in surprise.

  MCKAY
     (voiceover) Atlantis already has a containment
     chamber we can use. I'll forward the necessary
     modifications to Zelenka. Now, if he doesn't mess
     it up, he can make the changes we need before we
     even get there.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTAINMENT LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The modifications appear similar to the schematic.
     Everyone working in the area, including Zelenka,
     are wearing white sterile suits and hoods as they
     move equipment.

  ZELENKA
     (to female technician) Ready?


LOCATION--HERMIOD'S LAB, DAEDALUS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie are by Hermiod's station again,
     speaking to Hermiod.

  MCKAY
     Now we've been through these calculations a number
     of times, and I think we've settled on a
     containment field setup that should work for us.
     We just want to show you these...


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTAINMENT LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka presses some controls, checking the
     monitors. The monitor shows a steady green wave.

  ZELENKA
     Yes! We have it people! Good work! Good work,
     everybody.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone applauds. Zelenka checks his watch.

  ZELENKA
     Just in time.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Weir walk down the stairwell.

  WEIR
     Has he talked about his sister with you?

  SHEPPARD
     You know, once or twice in passing. Usually like,
     "oh come on, even my sister can do it!" You know,
     that type of thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir laughs. Zelenka meets them at the bottom of
     the stairs. He is still in his sterile suit.

  WEIR
     How's it coming, Radek?

  ZELENKA
     The simulations are all in the green. We're ready
     to try power-up.

  WEIR
     Just in time!

  ZELENKA
     (chuckles) Heh-heh. That's actually what I just
     said. Heh.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie beam into the Gate room in front
     of them. Jeanie is slightly turned away from them,
     and she stares around, bemused.

  JEANIE
     Holy cow! Tha-that can't be good for you.

  SHEPPARD
     Nothing to worry about. I've done it dozens of
     times. John Sheppard.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out his hand, and she turns and shakes
     it.

  MCKAY
     Yeah. She's married, and she's my sister.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm just saying hi.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, no. I know exactly what you're doing. I've
     seen that look before...Kirk.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rears back. Weir steps forward and shakes
     hands with Jeanie.

  WEIR
     Hello, Mrs. Miller. I'm Doctor Elizabeth Weir.
     Welcome to Atlantis.

  JEANIE
     Thank you. Mer's told me so much about you.

  SHEPPARD
     All good, I a-...did you just call him "Mer?"

  MCKAY
     (quickly) It's a...pet name. Where are we?

  ZELENKA
     Eh, simulations are all in the green. We're ready
     to try power up.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts leading them to the labs.

  JEANIE
     Really? So soon? That's amazing. Excellent work,
     Radek.

  ZELENKA
     (pleased and surprised) Thank you.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) Yes, we try not to encourage him. He's
     got a bit of an ego.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie and Zelenka exchange smiles behind McKay's
     back.


LOCATION--CONTAINMENT LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The machine is powered up. McKay is at one
     console. Jeanie and Zelenka are at the other.
     Technicians work nearby. Weir paces behind McKay.

  MCKAY
     In-chamber conditions are green. Containment field
     is in the green. Monitors are green.

  JEANIE
     (impatient) Everything's green.

  ZELENKA
     (low, to Jeanie) He likes to do the checklist.

  MCKAY
     (pleased) ZPM levels are well into the green, and
     back-up terminals are green. We're ready to
     initiate power-up.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Weir.

  WEIR
     Good luck.

  MCKAY
     All right. Here we go.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie walks over to his console.

  JEANIE
     Want to, uh, turn it on together?

  MCKAY
     Why would we do that?

  JEANIE
     Because it's both of our work?

  MCKAY
     Well, there's only room on the button for one
     finger, so...

  JEANIE
     Well, then can I do it?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but I-I'm right here. So...

  ZELENKA
     He likes to...push the button.

  JEANIE
     (annoyed) Fine. Go.

  MCKAY
     Powering up to five percent.

  ANNOTATION
     The circular machine activates, a golden glow
     comes from the center.

  MCKAY
     Containment field is holding. Power generation is
     steady.

  JEANIE
     What about exotic particles?

  MCKAY
     Jeanie, please! I'm on it. We are holding
     at...five percent.

  WEIR
     Good. Now what?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay opens his mouth to answer.

  JEANIE
     The safe thing to do is to hold at five percent
     for the next while.

  MCKAY
     She wasn't talking to you!

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie and Zelenka look at McKay.

  WEIR
     Actually, that was an open question to the floor.

  JEANIE
     (furious) "Shared credit", huh? "We'll do this
     together?" "Dad'll be so proud."

  MCKAY
     This is not the time or the place.

  JEANIE
     Fine. I'm going to my quarters.

  ANNOTATION
     She storms off.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well, good night. Thank you!

  WEIR
     So?

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortably) Well, obviously, we...hold at five
     percent for the next while and see if any problems
     turn up.

  WEIR
     (dryly) Right.

  MCKAY
     I should probably try to get some rest myself.
     Could you...?

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures to the female technician to take over
     his station and rushes away.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     The female technician sits monitoring the console.
     There is a sudden surge and bright light. She
     stands.

  FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     What the...? (to other technician) Shut it down.

  ANNOTATION
     The generator is shut down. The technician types
     on her keyboard. A display reads "foreign object
     in containment chamber".

  FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     "Foreign object?" Go get Doctor Zelenka.

  ANNOTATION
     Another tech rushes out of the room.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors to the containment chamber open. There
     is a green glow undulating within the chamber. It
     shuts off to show Rodney McKay on one knee in the
     center of the chamber. He looks up to find Zelenka
     and the other scientists staring at him.

  ROD
     It worked!

  ANNOTATION
     He jumps athletically out of the device and
     stands, looking pleased.

  ZELENKA
     (nonplussed) What are you doing?

  ROD
     Radek?

  ZELENKA
     Yes.

  ROD
     I need to speak to whoever's in charge of this
     project.

  ZELENKA
     But...that's you.

  ROD
     Well then, I guess I need to speak to me.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters the mess hall and immediately hears
     peals of laughter. He turns to corner to find his
     team sitting with Jeanie. Sheppard is laughing
     loudly. McKay approaches with a hesitant smile.

  MCKAY
     What is this?

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, Meredith!

  MCKAY
     (face falling) Oh, wonderful.

  JEANIE
     John here was kind enough to show me around, offer
     me a warm meal, and, uh, introduce me to some of
     your friends.

  MCKAY
     (suspicious) What have you told them?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie shrugs.

  SHEPPARD
     We weren't talking about you.

  MCKAY
     Oh, you weren't?

  TEYLA
     No. We were discussing...many things.

  SHEPPARD
     Now when the issue of, uh, bedwetting happened to
     come up, she may have mentioned something about
     your childhood.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie snickers. McKay looks aghast.

  MCKAY
     That is not true!

  RONON
     Relax. We all have embarrassing childhood stories.

  SHEPPARD
     Of course we do.

  RONON
     There was one time the school bullies made me eat
     lunch with my underwear on my head.

  MCKAY
     (hopeful) Oh!

  RONON
     Oh, wait. That was you.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone but McKay laughs.

  MCKAY
     Oh, har-de-har-har. And this is revenge for what,
     exactly?

  JEANIE
     You don't even know, do you?

  WEIR
     (over intercom) Colonel Sheppard and Doctor McKay,
     to the isolation room immediately!

  MCKAY
     Isolation room? (to Jeanie) Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Jeanie, and Sheppard leave.


LOCATION--ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir watches the large monitor of the Rodney McKay
     from the containment chamber, pacing the isolation
     room below, as McKay, Sheppard, and Jeanie enter.

  MCKAY
     What in the world...?!

  JEANIE
     It's you.

  WEIR
     No. That is a live closed-circuit feed of a man we
     have in the isolation room.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir walks over to the window. They follow and all
     look down at Rod, who looks back up at them.
     Jeanie keeps looking from him to McKay.

  JEANIE
     What?!

  WEIR
     He appeared in the containment chamber in some
     sort of force field.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you mean, he-he appeared?

  WEIR
     Out of thin air. I have Zelenka working on it.
     Obviously, we shut down the project.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, how'd he get in there?

  WEIR
     He claims to be from a parallel universe.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie turns angrily to her brother.

  JEANIE
     You said the odds against this were
     "astronomical!"

  MCKAY
     You saw the math!

  JEANIE
     Well, we got it wrong!

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well he's here now, so the question is: what
     does he want?

  WEIR
     To talk to you.

  MCKAY
     (to Jeanie) All right, you want shared credit?
     You're coming in with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie shakes her head negatively. McKay leaves.

  JEANIE
     Wait.

  ANNOTATION
     She follows.


LOCATION--ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Jeanie enter.

  ROD
     Wow. Now, I'd figure you'd be here, but, uh, but
     Jeanie? I'd always hoped we'd work together in
     Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie stares in shock at the two Rodney McKays.
     The alternate McKay wears a leather jacket, has a
     spiked hairstyle similar to Sheppard's, and
     carries himself with a cool confidence.

  JEANIE
     Huh. This is a first.

  MCKAY
     Huh.

  MCKAY AND ROD
     For me, too.

  ROD
     (gesturing to a chair) Have a seat. Now, I presume
     you go by...

  MCKAY
     Rodney.

  ROD
     Ah. Rod.

  MCKAY
     (to Jeanie) I could never get anyone to call me
     that.

  ANNOTATION
     Rod sits in the chair across from Rodney. Jeanie
     stands behind Rodney.

  ROD
     Okay, I'm gonna make some assumptions based on
     what I've seen here and from readings we've taken
     in my own space-time. Please stop me if I'm wrong.
     One: I presume you're running some sort of
     experiment that's designed to bridge between
     parallel universes? And two: it has something to
     do with power generation. Warm? Cold?

  JEANIE
     Uh, hot.

  ROD
     Well, I'm sure the experiment's been a success on
     this side, but it's having some rather serious
     repercussions in my universe.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie smacks McKay.

  JEANIE
     I told you!

  MCKAY
     Not now!

  JEANIE
     Dangerous exotic particles that don't belong in
     either of our universes are being created on your
     side of the bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay glares at Jeanie. Rod leans forward,
     concerned.

  ROD
     (surprised) Oh, so...you knew this could happen?

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortably) Uh, there was a...slight risk,
     yes?


LOCATION--ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  SHEPPARD
     This is weird.

  ROD
     (over intercom) Well, you're quite correct,
     Jeanie. And because these particles don't behave
     according to any of the laws of physics in our
     space-time, they are...


LOCATION--ISOLATION ROOM

  ROD
     (continuing) ...creating a tear in the fabric of
     our universe.

  JEANIE
     Huh. First a solar system, now a universe!

  MCKAY
     (impatient) Yes. How exactly did you get here?

  ROD
     Ah. Well, we detected the anomaly about twenty
     hours ago in space above the planet. We maneuvered
     one of our jumpers in close and tried to broadcast
     a signal to whoever was on the other side.

  MCKAY
     Yes, but of course, we would be unable to detect
     that signal from within the containment chamber.

  ROD
     So, Sheppard and I came up with a plan to beam a
     person into the anomaly. They would be protected
     by an Ancient personal force field we discovered.

  MCKAY
     (ruefully) I depleted ours.

  JEANIE
     Still, it was an incredible risk.

  ROD
     (with a self-deprecating chuckle) Well, it was
     Sheppard's idea.


LOCATION--ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Sheppard react to that modest comment.

  ROD
     (over intercom) We decided it might allow one of
     us to cross the bridge you created and bring the
     problem to your attention...


LOCATION--ISOLATION ROOM

  ROD
     There was very little time. And, eh, well, there
     seemed to be no other way. We drew straws...

  MCKAY
     You lost!

  ROD
     (smiling) No. I won! What, the prospect of saving
     an entire universe? No brainer!

  MCKAY
     Oh. Sure.

  JEANIE
     I-I can't begin to say how sorry we are.

  ROD
     (hopeful) Yes, well, you could, um, start by
     shutting down the experiment?

  MCKAY
     Already done. And after hearing what you've told
     me, I see no reason why we'd start it back up
     again.

  ROD
     Great! Then my work here is done. Mission
     accomplished.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives a thumbs up. They all give a small laugh.

  MCKAY
     Ah, well, yes. But how did you plan on getting,
     you know, back? I mean, to your own universe?

  ROD
     The matter bridge you created is unidirectional.

  JEANIE
     But that means...

  ROD
     Yes. Yes, it does.

  ANNOTATION
     They share awkward looks.

  JEANIE
     Huh.


LOCATION--GUEST QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Rod and Jeanie stand setting up bedding in a room
     as Sheppard and Rodney stand nearby.

  ROD
     So, Jeanie, you have three kids in this universe?

  JEANIE
     (chuckling) Uh, no. Just the one.

  ROD
     Huh. Well, I'm sure you're as great a mother in
     this space-time as you are in mine. Oh! This will
     blow your mind! I have photographs of your
     alternate life. Wanna see pictures of the kids you
     haven't had yet?

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls photos out of his jacket pocket.

  JEANIE
     Absolutely! (looks at pictures) Oh, look at
     Maddie! Who's that?

  ROD
     That's Bradley and Robbie.

  JEANIE
     Aw.

  ANNOTATION
     While they've been talking, McKay and Sheppard
     have had an animated discussion by the doorway.
     They leave Rod and Jeanie looking at pictures and
     start walking down the hall.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  MCKAY
     All right, what's the game plan here?

  SHEPPARD
     We put him up here in the guest quarters until we
     can find something more permanent.

  MCKAY
     Something more permanent?! Well, we're not keeping
     him!

  SHEPPARD
     He can't go back!

  MCKAY
     Well, that just doesn't mean he has to stay here!

  SHEPPARD
     He said he'd rather be on Atlantis than Earth.

  MCKAY
     Oh, I see. So he gets his way, and I don't?!

  SHEPPARD
     How can you not want to be with him? He's you!

  MCKAY
     He's not me! I'm me...the...real me.

  SHEPPARD
     I suppose it's all relative. To Rod, his reality
     is every bit as valid as ours. To him, we're the
     imposters.

  MCKAY
     What does Elizabeth have to say about all of this?

  SHEPPARD
     (smirking) Two McKays are better than one.

  MCKAY
     There aren't two McKays! There's one McKay
     and...him!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gets into an Atlantis transport and turns
     around.

  SHEPPARD
     Whatever you say...Meredith.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard smiles and presses the button to close
     the doors and activate the transport, leaving
     McKay rolling his eyes in the corridor.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A golf ball plops into the water.


LOCATION--DRIVING RANGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Rod and Sheppard hit from a bucket of golf balls
     into the ocean. Rod turns around and laughs at the
     length of his most recent shot.

  SHEPPARD
     (whistling) Nice shot! Easily 275. You know, I've
     been meaning to put up, uh, buoy markers, but who
     has the time, huh?

  ROD
     This is great! We don't have one of these where
     I'm from. Besides, you'd need to take a cattle
     prod to the Sheppard I know to get him up this
     early.

  SHEPPARD
     (chuckling) Late nights, partying, huh?

  ROD
     (nodding, but not quite in agreement) If you could
     call it that. He's, uh, very active with the MENSA
     club we have there. They have a lot
     of...um..."functions?"

  SHEPPARD
     (uncomfortable) Well, you can't blame a man for
     his intelligence.

  MCKAY
     No, but I can blame him for reminding me all the
     time.

  SHEPPARD
     (unnerved) He doesn't?

  ROD
     Mmm. Trust me, my Sheppard makes your Rodney
     seem...uh...modest in comparison.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard shifts, nonplussed.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I've got to admit, between you and me,
     you're a lot different than our Rodney, too.

  MCKAY
     How so?

  SHEPPARD
     It's the little things. Uh, you like golf. You say
     "please" and "thank you." You're um...what's the
     opposite of condescending?

  ANNOTATION
     Rod chuckles. Sheppard takes his shot with the
     golf club and they both watch it sail to the
     ocean.

  ROD
     Whoo. Now, I could help you with that hook.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters and hears laughter. He moves
     determinedly to his team's table, where all are
     laughing with Rod and Jeanie.

  MCKAY
     What the hell is this?

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, sleepyhead!

  MCKAY
     Yeah, hi.

  ROD
     I had a breakfast date with Jeanie. I guess it
     just kind of ballooned into a group affair. Look,
     sit down. We're tracing back our lives, trying to
     find the little differences between our pasts.

  TEYLA
     Rod is an honorary member of the Athosian Council.

  JEANIE
     And is godfather to his niece and nephews.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well how wonderful for him.

  ROD
     Well, it's easier for me. Our Earth has a ZPM too,
     so it makes the back and forth a lot simpler.

  ZELENKA
     (over intercom) Doctors McKay, please report to
     the containment chamber. Doctors McKay...?

  MCKAY AND ROD
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Both they and Jeanie start to leave.

  RONON
     Hey, uh, Rod! Are we still on to spar later?

  ROD
     Absolutely!

  ANNOTATION
     Rod and Ronon exchange a complicated handshake.

  ROD AND RONON
     Boh!


LOCATION--CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     The containment chamber is active. McKay rushes
     past Zelenka to the control panel. Rod and Jeanie
     are behind.

  MCKAY
     What do you mean you started it up again?

  ZELENKA
     Shutting the experiment down only made things
     worse for us, not better. The matter bridge is
     still active, but we are not drawing any power,
     creating pressure, like a--a dam. If we didn't
     turn it on again, it could have resulted in a
     catastrophic overloaded.

  ROD
     Oh...we should've thought of that.

  MCKAY
     (accusingly) Mm-hmm.

  JEANIE
     Don't look at me.

  MCKAY
     Oh, so you're willing to take all of the credit,
     but none of the blame, huh?

  JEANIE
     I never wanted all the credit.

  ROD
     (to Jeanie) No one is blaming you.

  JEANIE
     (with pointed look at McKay) Oh really?

  ROD
     Look, this is just a temporary solution. The
     Zelenka in my space-time estimates that there is
     at least a week and a half before the tear expands
     as far as the city...my city.

  JEANIE
     What will happen when it does?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Zelenka each take on stricken looks of
     realization.

  ROD
     Well, imagine what would happen if you just threw
     the laws of physics out the window.

  JEANIE
     Entropy...chaos.

  ROD
     Mmm. Worst case scenario, the entropy expands as
     far as the subspace layers, underneath our
     space-time.

  MCKAY
     It could travel almost instantaneously. I mean,
     your universe could just flash out of existence!

  ANNOTATION
     He snaps his fingers.

  ROD
     We need to mend that tear before it become
     irreparable. Now, I have some thoughts. Is there a
     place we can go to work?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, yes. Of course. Follow me.

  ROD
     Oh! Jeanie, we could use your help.

  ANNOTATION
     He taps her on the arm. She smiles and follows.

  JEANIE
     Thank you.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Rod stand by a work station.

  ROD
     Do you mind running up these power requirements?

  ANNOTATION
     He hands McKay a disk.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) Done.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay walks away with the disk, looking annoyed. A
     perplexed Rod watches him go. McKay turns back,
     and Rod turns back to the computer. McKay heads
     over to where Jeanie's working.

  MCKAY
     What were you doing having breakfast with him?

  JEANIE
     I don't often meet people from another universe. I
     found myself curiously interested.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, I don't want you hanging around with
     him any more.

  JEANIE
     What?

  MCKAY
     Look, I am your real brother.

  JEANIE
     In what sense?

  MCKAY
     Oh, what is that supposed to mean?

  JEANIE
     You haven't been a brother to me since I quit
     school.

  MCKAY
     (scoffs) You were making an incredible mistake. I
     was just trying to--

  JEANIE
     (interrupting) You were trying to control my life,
     Mer. I-I disagreed with you. I still do! And
     wh-what, because of that, you stopped being my
     brother?

  MCKAY
     I never stopped being your brother!

  JEANIE
     We haven't talked in four years!

  MCKAY
     Don't put all that on me.

  JEANIE
     It is all on you! I had no way of getting in touch
     with you.

  MCKAY
     I was doing top secret research in another galaxy!

  ANNOTATION
     Both turn to see if their raised voices have
     attracted Rod's attention. Rod continues to work
     on the computer, obviously trying not to
     listen...and not succeeding. They both lower their
     voices.

  JEANIE
     You could've sent me a message. You know, called
     me on my birthday, at-at Christmas. Once a
     year...that's all I would've needed. Just-just a:
     "hi, how are you? Are you happy? Are you okay?"
     That would've been enough, but you didn't even do
     that. No, no. I was wrong, and you were right, so
     what? I was not worth talking to?

  MCKAY
     (hurt, defensive) It wasn't like that at all.

  JEANIE
     You don't like me talking to Rod because it makes
     you realize how bad a brother you've really been.

  ANNOTATION
     Rod stiffens and turns to the pair, notably
     interrupting the argument.

  ROD
     (with false brightness) Hey! You guys got
     something over there?

  JEANIE
     (upset) No. We don't.


LOCATION--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay paces while Sheppard sits on his bed and
     cleans his golf clubs with a toothbrush.

  MCKAY
     He's slowing me down.

  SHEPPARD
     Really? I thought two of you would have sped
     things up.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, he's not me!

  SHEPPARD
     I know he's not the same person, trust me. I'm
     just saying, he's a genius too, isn't he?

  MCKAY
     Hmph. Unless he's lying.

  SHEPPARD
     (skeptical) About what?

  MCKAY
     What if the people on his Atlantis were sick of
     him messing up all the time, huh? So when it came
     time to send some stooge on a one-way ticket to
     another universe, there was only one guy they
     could do without.

  SHEPPARD
     Mm, say what you want, I know what this is about.

  MCKAY
     Oh, really, Mister Mensa in a parallel universe,
     what is this all about?

  SHEPPARD
     You think Jeanie likes him more than you.

  MCKAY
     What?! That's crazy! That's...that's...that's
     possibly true.

  SHEPPARD
     (smiling in agreement) Mm-hmm.

  MCKAY
     Huh. Jeanie and I drifted apart. I mean, that
     happens, I mean, it wasn't done maliciously. Do I
     have regrets? Yes, of course I do. But who
     doesn't? I mean, you know, I'm not very good at
     saying I'm sorry, or that-or that I'm wrong, you
     know, possibly because it happens so rarely.

  SHEPPARD
     (groaning in not-quite agreement) Mm-hmm.

  MCKAY
     So I didn't call, or write, and when I realized
     that four years had gone by, it was just
     a...you're right! Of course, you're right. I mean,
     she has every reason to hate me!

  SHEPPARD
     I didn't say she hates you.

  MCKAY
     Well, she should!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard looks up and shrugs.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if you insist.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well I do.

  SHEPPARD
     Well then, fair enough.

  ZELENKA
     (over intercom) Doctor McKay to the containment
     chamber. Doctor McKay...?

  MCKAY
     (distractedly to Sheppard) Good talk. Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves Sheppard swinging his golf club and
     looking a bit perplexed.


LOCATION--CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay joins Jeanie, Zelenka, and Rod in the
     containment chamber.

  ROD
     Great, he's here.

  MCKAY
     What's going on?

  ZELENKA
     Well, I set up a way to pick up transmissions
     inside the containment chamber should Rod's
     universe try to contact us. We, of course, still
     have no way of communicating with them, but--

  MCKAY
     (impatiently) They sent us a message.

  JEANIE
     Yeah. Apparently their exotic particle problem is
     spinning out of control much faster than they'd
     anticipated.

  MCKAY
     Oh, boy.

  ROD
     But they have a solution.

  MCKAY
     They do? That's great!

  ROD
     Well, not really. Their solution would not only
     destroy Atlantis, but tear a hole in the fabric
     of...this universe.

  MCKAY
     Oh boy.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Jeanie, Rod, Sheppard, and Weir are all in
     the briefing room. Computer displays show graphics
     depicting the connection between both universes.

  ROD
     Now, I'm not saying that their attempt would be
     successful. But...if it was, it would flood the
     exotic particles that are being created on their
     side into this space-time all at once.

  SHEPPARD
     And that would, uh...

  JEANIE
     Be...bad.

  SHEPPARD
     Right. I got that, but, uh...

  WEIR
     How bad?

  MCKAY
     Well, to be honest, the science gets extremely
     complicated. But, um, "simply put", the tear will
     eventually swallow up the entire galaxy, possibly
     the universe.

  SHEPPARD
     So...very bad.

  MCKAY
     Well I think we can all agree that that would be
     bad, yes.

  ROD
     Their plan will take six hours to implement.

  WEIR
     I suggest we do something before that.

  ROD
     Well, we have an idea.

  MCKAY
     Actually, Jeanie has an idea.

  JEANIE
     (surprised) Uh, we think we can collapse the
     bridge with a massive burst of energy from this
     side.

  ANNOTATION
     She types on her laptop and the graphic display
     demonstrates her idea.

  ROD
     And stop the creation of exotic particles on the
     other side by doing so.

  SHEPPARD
     How massive a burst are we talking?

  MCKAY
     Everything we've got. I mean, enough to severely
     deplete our ZPM.

  WEIR
     (sighing) So instead of creating a new powerful
     energy source, we'll be sacrificing the one we
     already have.

  MCKAY
     Yes. We'd still be able to dial Earth, but, uh,
     much less frequently, of course. And let's just
     say, I wouldn't be around here if the Wraith show
     up.

  ANNOTATION
     Rod gives a rueful chuckle of agreement.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't see that we have a choice.

  WEIR
     All right. Do it.


LOCATION--CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka turns from Jeanie to McKay.

  ZELENKA
     (skeptical) Doctor Weir gave the okay for this?

  MCKAY
     You'd rather the universe was destroyed?

  ZELENKA
     (after a pause) Not really.

  ROD
     Rodney, talk to you for a second?

  ANNOTATION
     Rod and McKay move to a more private area of the
     lab.

  ROD
     Look, the Daedalus is still in orbit. I thought,
     uh...

  MCKAY
     I know what you're going to say.

  ROD
     If I can beam into the...energy stream, protected
     by my personal force field...

  MCKAY
     You'd be transported back to your own universe. I
     know, I didn't bring it up before because if it
     doesn't work...

  ROD
     Well, I'm willing to take that risk. I've already
     requested the Daedalus to execute the transport to
     the coordinates inside the chamber on your mark.
     That is, if you're willing to do this.

  MCKAY
     (protesting) Everyone loves you here!

  ROD
     (chuckling) Yeah, but it's not home! Look, what,
     my Sheppard is a know-it-all, my Teyla is hard to
     talk to, and-and my Ronon is...well, actually,
     those two are pretty similar.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gives a small laugh.

  ROD
     I guess what I'm trying to say is that, for all
     their faults, they're my team! My place is with
     them. Besides, they're not looking for another
     McKay around here, they already have one!

  ANNOTATION
     He slaps McKay on the arm.

  MCKAY
     It's just a lesser model, hmm?

  ROD
     I envy you. You say exactly what's on your mind,
     no matter how it makes you look. I can only
     imagine the freedom you must have, not caring if
     people like you or not.

  MCKAY
     Oh. People don't like me?

  ROD
     Trust me, you've got it great here. Now, I've made
     some calculations. When the readings reach the
     levels I've indicated, you'll know whether or not
     I made it home.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands McKay his handheld computer.

  MCKAY
     Oh, I guess you just to, um, click your heels
     together, huh?

  ROD
     (smiling) Good luck, Rodney.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs McKay's hand and gives a complicated
     handshake.

  MCKAY
     (nonplussed) You-you too.

  ANNOTATION
     They rejoin the others.

  ROD
     Radek...(speaks Czech). Jeanie...

  ANNOTATION
     He embraces her.

  JEANIE
     (to McKay) You're letting him do this?

  MCKAY
     Hey, I tried to talk him out of it, but you
     know...Rod.

  ROD
     (keying intercom) Hermiod, ready when you are. (to
     everyone) Guess there's nothing left to say
     but...there's no place like home.

  ANNOTATION
     Rod is beamed away. They all turn back to the
     control station.

  ZELENKA
     All right, all in the green. Ready for forced
     power output.

  MCKAY
     Right, and...

  ANNOTATION
     He starts towards the master control, then pauses
     and turns to his sister.

  MCKAY
     Uh...you wanna press the button?

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka and Jeanie both look shocked.

  JEANIE
     Yeah...yeah...sure.

  ANNOTATION
     She presses the button. The chamber activates.

  ZELENKA
     Power is at full.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie and McKay move to different monitoring
     stations.

  JEANIE
     It's working!

  MCKAY
     (into comm) Hermiod, this is McKay. Commence
     transport.


LOCATION--HERMIOD'S LAB, DAEDALUS

  HERMIOD
     Transport is complete.


LOCATION--CONTAINMENT CHAMBER

  JEANIE
     The bridge is already beginning to destabilize.

  ZELENKA
     It's not yet enough!

  MCKAY
     ZPM's at fifty percent!

  ZELENKA
     It's still not enough, Rodney!

  JEANIE
     We have to max it out!

  MCKAY
     Thirty percent!

  JEANIE
     The bridge is collapsing. We've done it.

  ZELENKA
     Okay, we can shut it down now!

  MCKAY
     Not yet!

  ZELENKA
     What?!

  MCKAY
     According to these readings, if we shut it down
     now, he won't make it!

  JEANIE
     Give it a few more seconds.

  ZELENKA
     ZPM's at five percent.

  MCKAY
     Almost there....Cut power now!

  ZELENKA
     How much power did we drain from the ZP...M?

  ANNOTATION
     He stares at a monitor saying "Zero Point Module
     Depleted".

  MCKAY
     (heartbroken) All of it. I drained all of it.

  JEANIE
     You did the right thing.

  MCKAY
     Hmm. Well, I suppose I would've done the same
     thing for...me.

  ANNOTATION
     All the power shuts down in the room.

  MCKAY
     I am so fired.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--VIP CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     A younger McKay appears on a laptop video screen.
     (It's the video he made from "Letters from
     Pegasus").

  MCKAY
     (on video) Jeanie...this is your brother...Rodney.
     I want to s-say...um...family is important. I-I've
     come to realize that because the people here have
     become a sort of a, kinda, surrogate family to me.
     Now, I know what you're thinking. I've never
     really been the...poster child for that kind of
     sentiment. But, when-when one's contemplating
     one's own demise, one tends to see things...more
     clearly. I really do wish you the best, you know?
     And I'm sorry we weren't closer. Perhaps, um...if
     by chance I make it out of this, perhaps one day
     we can be. And I would like that. Now, if there's
     time, I'd like to...

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie shuts off the player. She and Sheppard are
     sitting in the room.

  JEANIE
     When did he record this?

  SHEPPARD
     Couple years back, when we thought the bad guys
     were gonna get us.

  JEANIE
     Now I've seen three sides of my brother.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters, surprised to see Sheppard there.

  MCKAY
     What are you two up to?

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie closes the laptop and hands it to Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     Nothing. Just, uh, telling stories about you. You
     know, trying to help her fall asleep.

  ANNOTATION
     He shoots McKay a knowing smile.

  MCKAY
     (unamused) Ah-ha-ha-ha.

  SHEPPARD
     (rising) I'll leave you guys alone.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay watches him leave and then stands around
     awkwardly. Jeanie looks equally unsure.

  MCKAY
     Hey.

  JEANIE
     Hey.

  MCKAY
     Hey, you should, be, uh, packing. Daedalus leaves
     in the morning.

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie picks up a duffle bag and points to it.

  JEANIE
     I'm done. How'd it go with Weir?

  MCKAY
     Oh. Um, well, she wasn't too happy about the
     whole..."killing-the-ZPM". But, um, you know, in
     the grand scheme of things, we did prevent the
     destruction of the universe, so...you know...not
     fired.

  JEANIE
     That's good.

  MCKAY
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     There is another awkward silence.

  MCKAY
     Oh, right. Uh...got this for Madison.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands Jeanie a humanoid statute.

  JEANIE
     Ooh...?

  ANNOTATION
     She looks at it, unsure how to respond.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, uh, I swiped it from Weir's desk. It's not
     like there's a Toys-R-Us nearby. So, uh...

  JEANIE
     Well, uh, it's the thought that counts, I guess.

  ANNOTATION
     She packs it.

  JEANIE
     I'd say "see ya around", but, uh...

  MCKAY
     Yes...about that...

  ANNOTATION
     Jeanie looks at her brother, confused. McKay looks
     hopeful.

  MCKAY
     Which is to say...uh...look...what I wanted to...

  JEANIE
     (rescuing him) Thank you for trying.

  ANNOTATION
     She fiddles with her bag. McKay deflates. He
     approaches her and hugs her. Moved, she returns
     the hug. They both fight back tears as they
     embrace.

  MCKAY
     How are you? You happy? You okay?

  JEANIE
     Yeah, Mer. I am. I really am.

  ANNOTATION
     They break away, but still remain standing close
     to each other.

  MCKAY
     Intergalactic gate network should be complete
     soon, so um...maybe it won't be four years next
     time?

  JEANIE
     (half-teasing) Does this mean I'll, uh, I'll see
     you at Christmas?

  MCKAY
     If you can convince Kaleb...not to make Tofurky.

  JEANIE
     (laughing) No promises!

  ANNOTATION
     He turns and leaves, smiling as he goes.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters a mostly empty mess hall, and hears
     the laughter of his teammates. He rounds the
     corner and approaches, looking clearly
     disgruntled.

  MCKAY
     Am I just not getting the team e-mails anymore?

  SHEPPARD
     Take it easy. We're just talking about Rod.

  MCKAY
     Oh, yes. Well of course you are.

  TEYLA
     Do you think he made it back to his universe?

  MCKAY
     Well, it's hard to say, really, but, uh, I doubt
     he'll be back, though.

  SHEPPARD
     That's good. We found him a little, uh, creepy.

  MCKAY
     What?

  RONON
     Yeah, I can't stand people who are nice all the
     time. It makes me feel like they're trying to hide
     something.

  MCKAY
     Really?

  TEYLA
     He kept trying to correct me on my Athosian
     history. It grew...tiresome very quickly.

  MCKAY
     Well, uh, he wasn't that bad.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's be honest, Rod was annoying.

  MCKAY
     I'll be honest with you. That's kind of nice to
     hear. Now...

  ANNOTATION
     The team exchange knowing looks as McKay turns and
     grabs a chair.

  MCKAY
     What else has been happening?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, Teyla's got the hots for one of the new
     marines.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla kicks Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     Ow!

  TEYLA
     That is not true!

  RONON
     (amused) You know it is.

  SHEPPARD
     Whoa-whoa-whoa...

  MCKAY
     Hardly new, either.

  ANNOTATION
     All the team, including McKay, begin to laugh.
