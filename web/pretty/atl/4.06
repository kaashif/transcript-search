TEASER

LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     A disoriented McKay sits on a stool in front of a
     table with a laptop computer. He panics when he
     realizes his left hand has been tied to the table.

  MCKAY
     Hey! Hey is anyone there?! Look, I need some help
     in here!

  ANNOTATION
     He struggles with the binding, then notices a
     post-it note on the tablet computer. It points to
     a button on the machine with the words "Press
     Here". He presses the button and a video appears
     showing a close up of McKay's face.

  MCKAY
     (recorded video) All right, look, I know you're
     probably panicking right now, but there is no time
     for that. You need to focus! I'm sure you're
     wondering...who tied you to the desk. Well, the
     truth is...it was you. I mean...me. I did it
     because I needed you to get this message. It would
     take too long to give you the full explanation,
     and you wouldn't remember it anyway, so you're
     just gonna have to just trust me on this. Now,
     you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your
     chair. Find it and cut yourself loose.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay finds the knife and cuts off the plastic
     restraint.

  MCKAY
     (recorded video) Now...I need you to listen. It is
     vitally important that you find this woman.

  ANNOTATION
     The video display moves to show a monitor
     displaying a file photograph of Teyla. Over the
     picture is written: "THIS IS TEYLA. FIND HER".
     Underneath is displayed "Teyla Emmagan--Athosian".
     The camera moves again to show McKay. McKay
     watches the recording of himself while rubbing his
     face, looking confused and afraid.

  MCKAY
     (recorded video) I don't know where she is, but
     you have to find her. She can help. Uh, check the
     mess hall, or maybe they took her to the brig. I
     don't know. You just have to keep looking. Don't
     worry about anything else. And for god's sake,
     don't trust anyone. Just find her, and do it fast,
     because if you don't, hundreds of people are going
     to die, including you.

  ANNOTATION
     The recording shuts off and the monitor now
     displays the picture of Teyla.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--BOTANY LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay wanders into the plant-filled room, clearly
     looking for someone.

  MCKAY
     Katie?

  ANNOTATION
     Katie turns from where she is working on some
     plants and approaches him.

  KATIE
     (brightly) Rodney! Hey, what are you doing here?

  MCKAY
     Well, I heard you were back, and I hadn't seen you
     for a while, so...

  KATIE
     Yeah, I know. We didn't--we have this whole new
     mainland to explore, and I've been bringing back
     samples all week.

  MCKAY
     So, I see. Anything interesting?

  KATIE
     Well, it's all pretty similar to what we found
     back on Lantia. We found a few new species.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  KATIE
     Oh, which reminds me, I've got a surprise for you.

  MCKAY
     Oh?

  ANNOTATION
     Katie giggles as she goes over to one of the
     tables and picks up a small potted cactus and
     brings it over to McKay. She clears her throat.

  KATIE
     I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery.

  MCKAY
     (nonplussed) What is that?

  KATIE
     Well, it doesn't have a name yet, but I'm thinking
     of calling it...Rodneyana Villosa...after you.

  MCKAY
     (excited) Really? What...you can do that?

  KATIE
     Yeah.

  MCKAY
     Huh.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds the pot and starts to touch the plant.

  KATIE
     Be careful! The bristles will pierce skin.

  MCKAY
     Oh. Anyway, look, I wondered if I could...tear you
     away from this long enough for us to have some
     lunch?

  KATIE
     Oh! I would-I would love to...

  MCKAY
     Oh!

  KATIE
     But I think I'm coming down with something. I have
     a headache, and I've had a few dizzy spells, so I
     was thinking of going down to the infirmary.

  MCKAY
     (unenthusiastic) Oh. Uh, well, I'll come... with
     you.

  KATIE
     Oh, no, Rodney. You don't have to do that. I know
     how much you hate being around sick people.

  MCKAY
     (nervously) Oh. No. Really. It's fine.

  KATIE
     Oh, that is so sweet. Thanks!

  MCKAY
     After you.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie walks out. McKay sets down the plant and
     wipes his hands on his jacket, then follows her.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Katie and McKay enter. Keller is on duty.

  KELLER
     Doctor Brown! I see you've brought my Number One
     Patient.

  MCKAY
     What? Oh, no. We're not here for me this time. I'm
     here for her.

  KELLER
     Oh. Okay, well, what can I do for you.

  KATIE
     I've got this really bad headache that won't go
     away, and I-I feel kind of dizzy.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller starts checking her throat.

  KELLER
     When did you first notice it?

  KATIE
     Sometime this morning. Why?

  KELLER
     Well, because you're the fourth person to come in
     here with those exact symptoms, and the second
     person from the botany department.

  ANNOTATION
     Keller indicates a filled infirmary bed. The
     patient waves to Katie.

  KATIE
     Gerald? Hey.

  MCKAY
     Who's that?

  KATIE
     Gerald Baxter. He's on my team. You've met him
     before. (sotto voce) He's got the bug collection?

  MCKAY
     Oh, sure, right, yeah. No, I remember now. Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     He half-heartedly waves.

  KELLER
     Well, I'm gonna have to take some blood. (to
     McKay) You too, Doctor.

  MCKAY
     What?

  KELLER
     If there is something going around, you might've
     been exposed to it as well. Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs in disappointment. Katie rubs her
     head.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter briefs Sheppard as they walk through the
     area. She is in civilian clothes, while he wears
     his BDUs.

  CARTER
     Major Dorsey and his team just returned from
     M6R-214. They examined the debris field above the
     planet, and found the parts from one, possibly two
     replicator ships.

  SHEPPARD
     Just a matter of time before the Wraith got
     organized and started hitting back.

  CARTER
     I suppose. They did defeat the Ancients, after
     all.

  SHEPPARD
     The replicators may look like the Ancients, and
     they may use the same technology, but they're
     gonna be a lot tougher to put down.

  KELLER
     (over comm) Colonel Carter, come in please.

  CARTER
     (keying comm) Go ahead, Doctor.

  KELLER
     (over comm) I've got a situation developing. Be
     advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire
     infirmary level.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Sheppard exchange alarmed looks.

  CARTER
     What's going on?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Keller walks through the infirmary, now crowded
     with staff and patients in various degrees of
     distress.

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between Carter's and
     Keller's locations.

  KELLER
     (into comm) Eleven patients have shown up here in
     the last hour complaining of headaches and
     dizziness. Eight of them are from the survey team
     that just got back from the mainland.

  CARTER
     Any idea what's wrong with them?

  KELLER
     I ran some blood tests and found a bacteria I've
     never seen before. I'm checking it against the
     Ancient database.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you want us to do?

  KELLER
     Well, first thing we need to do is isolate
     everyone that went to the mainland and have them
     report to Doctor Neves in the auxiliary med lab
     for testing.

  CARTER
     (over comm) Will do. Keep us posted.

  ANNOTATION
     As the communication ends, a lab tech approaches
     Keller.

  LAB TECH
     More test results. You and I are both infected. So
     is Doctor McKay. The good news is, the most
     advanced case is still only showing mild flu-like
     symptoms. Maybe it won't get any worse than that.

  KELLER
     Yeah, let's hope so.

  FADE TO WHITE


  PRESENT



LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay warily walks through the empty corridor. He
     carries the tablet computer in one hand.

  MCKAY
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns a corner and sees a man sitting against a
     wall. He sighs in relief.

  MCKAY
     Oh. Hey, hey wake up.

  ANNOTATION
     He jostles the man, who keels over, dead. Behind
     McKay, Zelenka appears. He brandishes a long thin
     rod as a weapon.

  ZELENKA
     What are you doing here?

  MCKAY
     I-I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     He approaches Zelenka, who raises the rod like a
     bat.

  ZELENKA
     What are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay raises his hand in surrender.

  ZELENKA
     You're not a soldier.

  MCKAY
     If you say so.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka lowers the rod and starts walking,
     motioning McKay to follow.

  ZELENKA
     You should come with me. It's safer.

  MCKAY
     No-no. Slow down. What's going on here?

  ZELENKA
     It's the soldiers. They're after us. If they catch
     us, they'll take us away.

  MCKAY
     Take us where? What soldiers? What is this place?

  ZELENKA
     (whispering) Shh! Will you shut up? The soldiers
     will hear us.

  MCKAY
     (shouting) What the hell is going on here?! Why
     can't I remember anything?!

  ZELENKA
     (soothingly) I don't know. No one can.

  MCKAY
     No one can? You've seen others?

  ZELENKA
     Yes. One or two others, apart from the soldiers.

  MCKAY
     (turning on his computer) What about her? Was she
     there?

  ANNOTATION
     He shows Zelenka Teyla's picture.

  ZELENKA
     No.

  MCKAY
     I have to find her.

  ZELENKA
     Why?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. It's important.

  ZELENKA
     Look, the soldiers probably have her by now, okay?
     C'mon.

  MCKAY
     Well, can we ask them?

  ZELENKA
     Are you crazy? If the soldiers see you, they shoot
     you, they take you away.

  MCKAY
     Again with the taking away.

  ZELENKA
     Look, you should come hide with me. It's safer.

  MCKAY
     I can't. I have to keep looking.

  ZELENKA
     Fine. Suit yourself. If you get yourself killed, I
     don't care.

  ANNOTATION
     He hurries away, muttering in Czech. McKay stays
     put, looking lost.

  TEN HOURS EARLIER



LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel in hazmat suits treat the various
     patients. McKay follows Keller to her computer.

  MCKAY
     It started suddenly, and then it just...uh, it
     just stopped.

  KELLER
     Okay. Well, I appreciate you telling me.

  MCKAY
     Aren't you going to do anything?

  KELLER
     To be honest, I don't see how it's relevant.

  MCKAY
     Well, it's a new symptom. I thought it might be
     important.

  KELLER
     I don't see how "a tingling sensation in your
     knees" relates to this condition, especially since
     you're the only one experiencing it.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but, so far. I'm just saying, we don't know
     anything about this disease.

  KELLER
     Look, the best thing for you to do right now is
     try to relax, okay? And let me do my work.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks over her shoulder while she types. She
     stops, and McKay nervously wanders away. Keller
     sighs, rolling her eyes.

  ANNOTATION
     In another part of the infirmary, Marie gives
     Katie a mug. Katie is in scrubs and on a bed.

  MARIE
     Here you go.

  KATIE
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie sips her tea. Marie leaves and McKay
     arrives.

  KATIE
     (slightly hoarse) What did Doctor Keller say?

  MCKAY
     Oh, she's gonna, uh, take it into consideration,
     thanked me for my input, and, uh. How you doin?

  ANNOTATION
     Katie doesn't seem to know what to do with her
     mug. McKay notices and places it on the bedside
     table.

  KATIE
     I'm okay.

  MCKAY
     Well, Doctor Keller's got her team working pretty
     hard. I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff.
     I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this
     thing in no time.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie nods, but looks distracted and in pain.

  MCKAY
     (concerned) Seriously, are you okay?

  KATIE
     (sighing) It's...my headache. It's-it's getting
     worse.

  MCKAY
     All right, look, is there anything I can do?

  KATIE
     Could you, uh, ask the nurse to bring me some tea?

  MCKAY
     Well, what's wrong with this one?

  ANNOTATION
     He picks up the mug.

  KATIE
     Oh, yeah...right.

  ANNOTATION
     They turn at a clattering sound. One of the people
     wearing hazmat has collapsed. It is Marie. Keller
     rushes over and she and another aide help Marie
     up.

  KELLER
     Marie? What's-what's going on?

  MARIE
     I don't know. I just got really dizzy. Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks alarmed. Katie watches blankly.


LOCATION--CARTER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Sheppard are in the office.

  CARTER
     (into comm) Are you telling us that the infection
     has breached hazmat protocol?


LOCATION--KELLER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between the two offices.

  KELLER
     I'm not entirely sure. It's possible she could've
     been previously exposed, but that would mean it's
     already spread much farther among the general
     population than we thought. I've got off-duty
     medical personnel conducting random blood tests
     around the city just to get a sense of where we're
     at.

  SHEPPARD
     Have we confirmed it came from the mainland?

  KELLER
     Well, the plant and soil samples brought back by
     the botany department were negative, but it still
     seems like the mostly likely point of origin.

  CARTER
     What about the database?

  KELLER
     I haven't found a match yet, but I'm still
     looking. There is one more thing. Since we have no
     idea what this disease does, or how it's spread,
     or even if our containment measures are having any
     effect, I recommend we suspend all Gate travel
     immediately.

  CARTER
     Thank you, Doctor.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay eats a tray full of food at Katie's bedside.
     Katie wakes up.

  MCKAY
     (smiling) Hey! How you feeling?

  KATIE
     I, I-I don't know.

  MCKAY
     Oh, well, they brought dinner. The salisbury
     steak's actually quite good. Oh, and by the way, I
     asked Doctor Keller about your friend Doctor
     Baxter. She says he's asleep, but apparently the
     fever's down.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie looks around bewildered.

  KATIE
     Who?

  MCKAY
     Doctor Baxter? That's his name, right? The...guy
     on your team...? Katie?

  ANNOTATION
     Rodney becomes concerned as Katie continues to
     look around utterly confused.

  KATIE
     Where am I?

  MCKAY
     What do you mean? You're in the infirmary. I
     brought you here, remember?

  KATIE
     Who are you?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks at her in shock.

  PRESENT



LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay continues to wander the halls. Lorne and a
     team of guards appear at the far end. Lorne spots
     McKay and raises his pistol.

  LORNE
     Hey! Hold it right there!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns and raises his hand in surrender.

  MCKAY
     I don't want to cause any trouble, I just...

  ANNOTATION
     They stun him and he collapses to the floor,
     unconscious. His computer slides away in the fall.
     The group approaches, and Lorne checks him over.

  LORNE
     Yeah, put him with the others. Go on. Get him out
     of here. C'mon.

  GUARD
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The carry McKay away. Lorne pops a pill and hands
     one to one of his men as they follow. McKay's
     computer, still displaying Teyla's picture,
     remains unnoticed under a chair.

  EIGHT HOURS EARLIER



LOCATION--CARTER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard enters.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, what's the word?

  CARTER
     Well, the random test results came back. Six
     different people working in six different areas of
     the city--all positive.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that doesn't sound very promising.

  CARTER
     Well, it's either a statistical miracle, or the
     entire base has been exposed. We're running more
     tests to confirm it, but it doesn't look good.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't know about you, but I feel fine.

  CARTER
     Well, me too. And that's the problem. If there is
     a delay before the first symptoms appear, it
     could've spread anywhere before we even knew what
     was happening. I've informed Stargate Command that
     we're suspending Gate operations.

  KELLER
     (over comm) Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller.

  CARTER
     (into comm) Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between
     Keller's office to Carter and Sheppard.

  KELLER
     I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown as well three
     other patients who are beginning to show signs of
     amnesia. All of them show large concentrations of
     affected cells in the medial temporal lobe. It
     looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to
     produce a hormone that interferes with the brain's
     ability to access episodic memory.

  ANNOTATION
     While Keller talks, Sheppard and Carter look at
     display in Carter's office, showing the test
     results. Sheppard and Carter exchange concerned
     looks.

  SHEPPARD
     How bad are we talking?

  KELLER
     Well, the rate of deterioration seems to vary from
     patient to patient. But in all cases, it looks
     like it's progressive--meaning, the longer they go
     without treatment, the worse it gets. Pretty soon,
     they won't be able to remember their own names.

  CARTER
     You said the first symptoms were headaches and
     dizziness.

  KELLER
     Yeah, that's right.

  CARTER
     How long after they appeared before the first
     signs of memory loss?

  KELLER
     Again, it seems to vary, but you're looking at an
     average of about six hours.

  SHEPPARD
     How about you, Doc? Showin' any signs?

  KELLER
     Yeah, the headache started half an hour ago.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Sheppard both sigh.

  CARTER
     All right, keep searching the database. I still
     think it's our best bet to find a solution.

  KELLER
     I'd...love to, but if we're right about these
     numbers, I'm about to get overrun with a lot of
     new patients. It's already pretty crowded in here.

  SHEPPARD
     Mess hall. We can clear it out and make a
     temporary ward.

  KELLER
     Yeah, that's a good idea. At the very least, it'll
     consolidate everyone in one place for treatment.

  CARTER
     Do it.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leaves.

  PRESENT



LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay regains consciousness lying on a cot. He
     groans as he sits up. The mess hall is filled with
     confused people, including Keller.

  MAN
     Are you all right?

  MCKAY
     Yeah. Where am I?

  KELLER
     We were hoping you could tell us.

  MCKAY
     Who are all you people?

  MARINE
     We don't know.

  KELLER
     None of us can remember anything.

  MAN
     What's happening out there? What did you see?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands.

  MCKAY
     Nothing. It was just...empty hallways. How did I
     get here?

  KELLER
     The soldiers brought you.

  MCKAY
     Why?

  NEVES
     They-they bring everyone here. They say it's for
     our own protection.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay goes over to the door and tries to open it,
     but it is sealed.

  SCIENTIST TWO
     Don't waste your time. It won't open.

  MCKAY
     (panicking) Why are they doing this to us? Look,
     why can't anyone remember? My...computer. Where's
     my computer?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts searching under the cot where he'd been
     lying.

  KELLER
     It wasn't with you when they brought you here,
     why?

  MCKAY
     I have to find someone. It's...uh...a woman.
     Teyla! Do you know who that is?

  ANNOTATION
     Keller shakes her head.

  MCKAY
     (raising voice) Does anyone here know Teyla...?
     Anyone...?

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks back at him blankly.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon set up hospital cots in the
     mess hall as others move in supplies.

  RONON
     I thought this city had some sort of automatic
     lockdown to prevent stuff like this.

  SHEPPARD
     It does.

  RONON
     Oh yeah? What happened?

  SHEPPARD
     You're asking me?

  ANNOTATION
     He leans over on the cot they just placed and
     grabs at his forehead.

  RONON
     You got a headache?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I guess it was just a matter of time, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla approaches.

  TEYLA
     (concerned) John?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm fine.

  ANNOTATION
     He pats her on the arm as he leaves. Ronon sits on
     the cot.

  RONON
     Hey. How you feelin?

  TEYLA
     I am fine.

  RONON
     Any symptoms?

  TEYLA
     No, none yet.

  RONON
     Me neither.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks thoughtful. Teyla notices.

  TEYLA
     What is it?

  RONON
     How do they know we're all infected? My blood
     wasn't part of the sample that was tested.

  TEYLA
     Nor was mine. Even so, it is likely we were
     exposed.

  RONON
     So? Being exposed doesn't mean you've got it.
     Maybe it doesn't affect everybody the same way.
     All I know is, I feel great.

  ANNOTATION
     He shrugs.

  TEYLA
     (sighing) So do I. Perhaps you should make Doctor
     Keller aware of this.

  RONON
     Yeah. Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon passes personnel moving equipment to
     approach Keller. She and a nurse are with Baxter.

  RONON
     (to technician) Excuse me. (to Keller) Doctor
     Keller! I need to talk to you.

  KELLER
     Uh, I'm a little busy right now.

  RONON
     I'm not sick.

  KELLER
     Well, if you're lucky enough not to be exposed,
     you just blew it by coming in here.

  RONON
     No, I know I've been exposed. People I've been
     working with all day have been getting sick. But
     I'm not feelin' anything. Neither is Teyla.

  KELLER
     You think you might have some kind of immunity?

  ANNOTATION
     She moves up to him and feels his lymph nodes.

  RONON
     You're the doctor.

  KELLER
     Okay. I'm gonna need a sample of your blood.

  RONON
     Take as much as you need.

  ANNOTATION
     He follows her.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay has taken off his jacket and is writing
     various notes on his arms in black felt marker.

  KELLER
     What are you doing?

  MCKAY
     I have to remember somehow. I already feel certain
     things slipping away.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets off the cot where he's been sitting. Katie
     is lying on a hospital bed nearby, unconscious.
     McKay stands on a stool.

  KELLER
     All right, now what are you doing?

  MCKAY
     Gettin' out of here. (calling out to everyone) All
     right, everyone! Listen up! I need to escape as
     quickly as possible. Does anyone know how I can do
     that?

  KELLER
     You can't just leave.

  MCKAY
     Why not?

  MARIE
     What about the soldiers?

  ANNOTATION
     Several gather around, Carter is also among the
     group.

  MCKAY
     We're just going to have to deal with them. I'm
     sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust
     them.

  NEVES
     That doesn't mean we should be running loose. We
     have no idea what's out there.

  MCKAY
     Look, something caused this to happen. All right?
     And we're not gonna figure it out from in here.
     Somewhere out there, there is a woman that...a
     woman named...

  ANNOTATION
     He winces, unable to remember.

  CARTER
     (stepping forward) Teyla.

  MCKAY
     Teyla, right. Thank you. I think she knows
     something.

  KELLER
     What?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. We gotta get out there and find out.

  CARTER
     I think we should listen to him.

  KELLER
     Why?

  CARTER
     Wh-it makes sense! Why haven't the soldiers told
     us what's happened? Why haven't there been any
     announcements, or-or any help on the way? Maybe
     they don't know any more than we do. We need a
     plan.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE AND CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard joins McKay walking up the central
     staircase to the control room.

  SHEPPARD
     They let you out?

  MCKAY
     Well, the second set of random blood tests just
     came back, all positive. They didn't see much
     point in, uh, quarantining the infirmary anymore.

  SHEPPARD
     You showing any signs?

  MCKAY
     Headache?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, same here.

  MCKAY
     Five bucks says you start losing your memories
     first.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney...!

  ANNOTATION
     They join Carter in the control room.

  CARTER
     All right, we've got food, water, and blankets. We
     don't have enough beds, but we're just gonna have
     to make do.

  MCKAY
     All right, well we may need to think about, uh,
     ordering all non-essential personnel to report to
     the mess hall. I mean, they're gonna wind up there
     anyway. And this way, we won't have people
     wandering the hallways.

  SHEPPARD
     That's what I'm worried about. I'll send Lorne and
     a team out, make sure those orders are followed.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive in Carter's office.


LOCATION--CARTER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter hands Sheppard and McKay containers of
     small white pills.

  CARTER
     These are from Doctor Neves. They're stimulants.
     He thinks they may slow the effect of the memory
     loss. It's just a stopgap, but at least it may buy
     us a few hours.

  MCKAY
     Do we know what's in these? Because, I'm allergic
     to a lot of--

  SHEPPARD
     Just take it.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard dry swallows his own pills with a
     flourish. McKay more hesitantly takes one tablet.
     Carter hands Sheppard another bottle of pills.

  CARTER
     Hand these out to Lorne and his men. And one more
     thing. I've ordered Doctor Zelenka to remove the
     gate's main control crystal. No matter what
     happens, we cannot risk spreading this disease
     elsewhere in the galaxy, or to Earth.

  MCKAY
     And what happens when we all start losing our
     memory?

  CARTER
     Doctor Keller will come up with something before
     that happens.

  ANNOTATION
     She bites her lip. None look confident.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon enters the infirmary to find Keller there
     with Marie and Baxter, who's breathing
     erratically. Keller looks flushed shiny with
     perspiration.

  RONON
     Hey...I thought we were moving everyone to the
     mess hall.

  KELLER
     He's our most advanced case. His vitals are too
     unstable. What can I...do for you?

  RONON
     I was just wondering if you found anything.

  KELLER
     What do you mean?

  RONON
     I'm not showing any signs of the disease,
     remember?

  KELLER
     Oh, well, it's possible you could have some sort
     of...natural immunity.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts examining Ronon the same as she did
     before.

  RONON
     (worried) Doc...?

  KELLER
     Stay here, I'm going to take a sample of your
     blood.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds her back.

  RONON
     Doc...you've already done that.

  KELLER
     It's happening to me, isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     Alarms start to ring from Baxter's monitors.

  MARIE
     Doctor, he's convulsing!

  ANNOTATION
     Keller and Ronon rush over.

  KELLER
     Okay, uh, give him, um, uh, meda...medazolam, four
     milligrams. He's in V-fib. I need a crash cart!

  ANNOTATION
     Neves rolls one over.

  KELLER
     Charge it to 200. Clear. (she shocks him) Charge
     it to 300! Clear.

  ANNOTATION
     She shocks him again. The monitor goes flatline.
     Keller looks scared.

  PRESENT



LOCATION--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne's team approaches with more strays. As they
     open the doors, everyone inside rushes the
     soldiers, knocking them down. Lorne's team
     scramble to unholster their stunners.

  MAN
     Go! Go!

  LORNE
     Stop!

  ANNOTATION
     The soldiers begin to fire at the crowd, stunning
     many, but others break free, including McKay and
     Carter.

  KELLER
     This way!

  ANNOTATION
     She gestures for Carter and McKay to come through
     an alcove, but gets stunned herself. Carter drags
     McKay through and they escape. Lorne and his team
     give chase.


LOCATION--CHAMBER, ATLANTIS

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay, breathing heavily, enter the
     room.

  CARTER
     Okay, I think we're clear.

  MCKAY
     Oh thank god. My lungs were about to give out. So
     what next?

  CARTER
     I don't know. How do we find her?

  MCKAY
     Who?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs his arm and points at the writing.

  CARTER
     Teyla! The one we just risked our lives for!

  MCKAY
     Right, right. I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter wanders into the next chamber.

  CARTER
     All right, we just have to search room by room. I
     mean. How big could this place possibly be?

  ANNOTATION
     She continues walking through a door that opens,
     it leads out onto a balcony in the city. McKay and
     Carter stare in shock at the scale of Atlantis.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Ronon and some marines escort a pair of
     scientists to the mess hall.

  SCIENTIST
     Where are you taking us?

  SHEPPARD
     I already told you, the mess hall.

  SCIENTIST
     I don't wanna go there.

  SHEPPARD
     Just relax. I know you're scared. But you're just
     going to have to trust me. It's for your own good.
     (low, to Ronon) So much for coming quietly.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard continues to lead the group down the
     hall. Ronon looks confused and he and a marine
     start to veer to a corridor to the right.

  RONON
     Hey...! Mess hall's this way.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard heads over to Ronon.

  SHEPPARD
     Right! Right. Don't look at me that way. It's easy
     to get turned around in this place.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors open and they enter the mess hall.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     The mess hall is crowding with people. Sheppard
     and Ronon report to Carter, who's already there.

  SHEPPARD
     Major Lorne's picking up some more stragglers.
     We're starting to get a little resistance.

  CARTER
     Yeah, they're starting to lose their memories.
     They probably can't understand why there's a bunch
     of "soldiers" after them.

  SHEPPARD
     That's why I told him to take his men to the
     armory and equip them with stunners.

  CARTER
     (wincing) I'm not sure I like the idea of us
     shooting at our own people.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we may not have a choice.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I suppose you're right. Pretty soon, there's
     gonna be some panicked, confused people out there.
     Okay, carry on.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leaves. Sheppard looks lost in thought.

  RONON
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Come with me.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the mess hall.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ARMORY

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne's men arm themselves while Lorne pops down
     some more stimulants. Sheppard and Ronon enter.

  SHEPPARD
     You might want to go easy on that stuff, Major.

  LORNE
     Sir, we need to delay this thing as much as
     possible. If we all go, there's no coming back.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I know. That's what I want to talk to you
     about. I've got an idea.

  PRESENT DAY



LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay walk down a corridor.

  MCKAY
     Didn't we come this way before?

  CARTER
     No.

  MCKAY
     Are you sure?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks around.

  CARTER
     No.

  MCKAY
     I have an idea.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a marker out of his pocket and marks up a
     corner of the wall.

  CARTER
     What are you doing?

  MCKAY
     If we come back here, we'll know we've been this
     way before.

  CARTER
     Presuming of course, that we remember that we're
     the ones who put it there in the first place.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear someone coming down the hall, so they
     hide against the wall.

  ZELENKA
     I know you're out there! Drop your weapons and
     come out slowly.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka spins around randomly pointing a stunner
     weapon. He's got McKay's tablet computer clutched
     to his chest. McKay and Carter peer around the
     corner and see him.

  MCKAY
     (to himself) Little guy with glasses...Huh.

  ANNOTATION
     He frantically looks at the notes on his arms. He
     starts to move out from hiding, but Carter grabs
     his arm.

  CARTER
     What are you doing?!

  MCKAY
     Hey, I know him. (to Zelenka) Don't shoot. We
     don't have any weapons.

  ANNOTATION
     He raises his hands in surrender. Carter follows.

  ZELENKA
     Who are you?

  CARTER
     We were captured by the soldiers. We escaped.

  ZELENKA
     Really?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay spots the computer.

  MCKAY
     Wait a second. What is that?

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka looks at the computer, then shakes his
     head, raising his weapon.

  ZELENKA
     I found it.

  MCKAY
     Let me see.

  CARTER
     What is it?

  MCKAY
     I don't know, but something tells me it's
     important.

  ZELENKA
     Why?

  MCKAY
     I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka hands it over. McKay presses the button on
     the side which turns on the screen. The picture of
     Teyla appears along with the message to find her.

  ZELENKA
     Hey, how did you know to do that?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. I just did.

  CARTER
     Well, that's her! Teyla!

  ZELENKA
     You know her?

  CARTER
     Well, not exactly. We're looking for her. We think
     she can help us.

  MCKAY
     Huh...

  ZELENKA
     It says, "find her." How are we going to do that?

LOCATION--CARTER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Keller briefs Carter, Teyla, Sheppard, McKay, and
     Ronon.

  KELLER
     This is what I wanted to show you.

  TEYLA
     This is the bacteria that is causing our disease?

  KELLER
     Not exactly, but it's very similar.

  CARTER
     And you found this in the database?

  KELLER
     I stopped looking in the database. I knew there
     was a reason why Teyla and Ronon are the only
     people who have tested negative so far. And we
     don't have a lot of records on the Satedans, so I
     started looking through Doctor Beckett's records
     on the Athosians. This is a blood sample taken
     from a ten year old boy. He was suffering from
     something called um...uh...I wrote it down.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks around blankly.

  TEYLA
     (hesitantly) Kirsan fever?

  KELLER
     Yeah, that's it.

  TEYLA
     It is a common childhood ailment throughout the
     galaxy. I had it when I was...eight.

  RONON
     I had it when I was ten.

  TEYLA
     But this cannot be the same disease. Kirsan fever
     does not affect adults, nor does it cause memory
     loss.

  KELLER
     Well, that may be true, but the structure of the
     bacteria is too similar to ignore. They have to be
     related somehow.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts to snap his fingers.

  MCKAY
     Wait a minute. Maybe they are the same. That would
     explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a
     threat.

  TEYLA
     How is that possible?

  MCKAY
     Well, think about it. I mean, this planet didn't
     have a Stargate until we came here. Maybe when the
     Ancients were-were first, uh, scouting this place,
     they accidentally brought this, uh...uh, Kirsan
     Fever with them. It got trapped here, and over the
     course of ten thousand years, it mutated to cause
     the symptoms we're now experiencing.

  KELLER
     That would also explain why you and Ronon aren't
     effected. You have antibodies built up from when
     you were young.

  CARTER
     Well, if they have the antibodies, then--

  KELLER
     It would take months to reverse-engineer a cure. I
     mean, I'm not even sure it's possible.

  TEYLA
     The sap of the enchuri plant. My people have used
     it for generations to combat Kirsan Fever. It is
     highly effective, and not much is needed.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's go get some.

  CARTER
     Take a jumper.

  RONON
     Wait a minute. You disabled the 'Gate, remember?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at them blankly.

  TEYLA
     You ordered Doctor Zelenka to take the control
     crystal. Where did he put it?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Zelenka, this is Sheppard, come in.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne leads his team.

  LORNE
     Check out the rooms down there, and there. I want
     this section cleared out in ten minutes.

  SHEPPARD
     (over comm) Lorne, come in.

  LORNE
     (into comm) Yes, sir. Go ahead.

  SHEPPARD
     (over comm) Have you seen Zelenka?

  LORNE
     (into comm) As a matter of fact, I have.

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between Carter's office
     and the corridor with Lorne.

  SHEPPARD
     Did you bring him to the mess hall?

  LORNE
     Uh, sorry, sir. But he gave us the slip. Must've
     heard us coming. Cracked one of my people over the
     head with a metal rod, and disappeared down a
     service hatch before I could get a shot off.
     There's no telling where he is now.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone in Carter's office looks at each other in
     shock and dismay.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team searches the corridor for Zelenka.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Zelenka, respond. Zelenka, come in.

  TEYLA
     Radek, we are not trying to hurt you. We need your
     help!

  MCKAY
     Okay, this is pointless. Look, we don't even know
     if he still has a radio. And even if we find him,
     chances are, he's not gonna remember what he did
     with the control crystal. Let's face it, we're
     screwed.

  SHEPPARD
     There's gotta be some way out of this. What about
     the jumpers? They've got DHDs.

  MCKAY
     That doesn't matter. Without the control crystal,
     the 'Gate can't establish a stable wormhole. We're
     not going anywhere.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm missing something. I-I can't concentrate.

  RONON
     What about the mainland?

  TEYLA
     Ronon's right. The enchuri plant is abundant on
     many worlds. It may be here as well.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. Assuming we can find the stuff, how are
     are we gonna distribute it.

  MCKAY
     (sighing) I'll figure something out.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads to his lab.

  TEYLA
     (to Ronon) I'll stay with Rodney. Do you know what
     to look for?

  RONON
     It grows like a weed on Sateda.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods and follows McKay.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard enters the jumper and looks around
     blankly. Ronon, carrying some empty sacks, closes
     the door and motions Sheppard to the pilot's
     chair.

  RONON
     It's, uh, right there.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon sit.

  RONON
     You can fly this thing. It's in your
     blood...literally.

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper flies out of the bay.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay steps away from his laptop to move to
     another computer. En route, he starts blinking
     heavily and looking unsteady.

  MCKAY
     Oh...wait a second. What am I doing?

  TEYLA
     You said the quickest way to spread the cure was
     to aerosolize it and distribute it through the
     ventilation system. You are currently attempting
     to override base protocol for temperature,
     humidity, and air pressure.

  MCKAY
     Right. Right. Okay, that's easy. It's just a
     simple matter of accessing the root directory
     and... (he presses a few buttons, and the computer
     beeps an alarm) Aw, come on!

  TEYLA
     Rodney--

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, no. I should be able to do this in my
     sleep. Oh god...it's happening to me too, isn't
     it?

  TEYLA
     You have to remain calm.

  MCKAY
     Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. My memory
     was lousy to start with. I mean, people's names,
     birthdays...I once forgot mother's day five years
     in a row.

  TEYLA
     What is the ratio of a circle's circumference to
     its diameter?

  MCKAY
     Well, that-that's pi. 3.14159265, etc., etc. But
     that doesn't count, that's easy.

  TEYLA
     You are a scientist, Rodney. That is what you care
     about. That is what you will hang onto the
     longest.

  MCKAY
     Right. Right, so... Wait a minute, doesn't that
     make me a really bad person?

  TEYLA
     It makes you the type of person who is going to
     save all our lives.

  MCKAY
     Oh, okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla gets him to turn back to his work.

     Carter, Zelenka, and McKay enter the infirmary. It
     is empty, and supplies are scattered everywhere.

  ZELENKA
     What is this place?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. Looks like they left in a hurry.

  CARTER
     She's not here, let's...

  MARINE
     (from down the hallway) This way! Let's go!

  CARTER
     (whispering) Quiet! Go-go!

  ANNOTATION
     She shoos at them to hide. They scatter and take
     refuge behind equipment. Lorne and his team enter.

  LORNE
     All right. Everybody spread out. They've got to be
     in here somewhere.

  ANNOTATION
     The team looks around, passing very near the
     hiding places. One person spots something in the
     cabinet Carter hides behind.

  MARINE
     (to Lorne) Sir! Found them!

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up bottles of stimulants.

  LORNE
     Good. Let's go. Let's move out. Come on.

     Lorne's team leaves. Carter steps out of hiding.

  ZELENKA
     Can we get out of here, please?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at him with a thoughtful expression.

  MCKAY
     What is it?

     hesitantly follows.

  RONON
     Let's go.

  SHEPPARD
     Wait a minute. What is this place?

  RONON
     The mainland.

  SHEPPARD
     What are we doing here?

  RONON
     (impatiently) I told you already. We need to get
     that plant.

  SHEPPARD
     Something seems fishy.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon primes his pistol and stuns Sheppard, who
     collapses unconscious onto the ramp.

  RONON
     Never gets old.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon hogties the unconscious Sheppard on the
     bench inside the jumper and heads out.

  RONON
     Sorry, buddy. You're just going to slow me down.

  ANNOTATION
     He closes the jumper door with the remote and runs
     off.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  TEYLA
     How's it coming, Rodney?

  MCKAY
     I'm just about finished...I-I think.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear a clatter outside.

  MCKAY
     What was that?

  TEYLA
     I will go see. Keep working.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla steps into the corridor outside. McKay looks
     nervous, then turns back to his computer.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla cautiously walks around. Lorne's team comes
     around a corner, raising their weapons instantly
     upon spotting her.

  LORNE
     Don't move!

  TEYLA
     (smiling) Major Lorne. It's me, Teyla.

  LORNE
     You shouldn't be out here.

  TEYLA
     Major, it's me.

  LORNE
     Everyone's been ordered back to the mess hall.

  TEYLA
     But Doctor McKay and I--

  LORNE
     Put your hands on your head...slowly.

  ANNOTATION
     Two of the men step forward with restraints ready.
     When they get close enough, Teyla fights them off
     with hand to hand. Her movements allow her to
     dodge Lorne's blast. She gets a stunner off one
     guard then uses him as a shield. She backs away as
     Lorne hits his man. They give chase.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  MCKAY
     (whispering) Teyla?

  ANNOTATION
     He approaches the door, but sees no one.

  MCKAY
     Oh god.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne and his lone man chase Teyla. They shoot
     their stunners at each other. One man finally hits
     Teyla with a stunner blast. They approach
     cautiously, but she is out cold.

  LORNE
     All right, let's get her up.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay fumbles with a camcorder.

  MCKAY
     Come on...All right, look, I know you're probably
     panicking right now, but there is no time for
     that. You need to focus! I'm sure you're
     wondering...who tied you to the desk.

  PRESENT



LOCATION--BRIG

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla paces inside. Lorne enters. He's sweating
     and looking ill.

  LORNE
     You're awake.

  TEYLA
     Major Lorne, you must set me free--

  LORNE
     Save it. You're not going anywhere 'till I get
     some answers. I need to know what you've done to
     my people.

  TEYLA
     What I've done? You believe I'm behind this?

  LORNE
     Is-is it a drug? Some kind of bio-weapon?

  TEYLA
     Major, they're sick. You as well. The entire base
     is infected with a disease.

  LORNE
     Everyone except you.

  ANNOTATION
     He fumbles in a pocket for his bottle of
     stimulants.

  TEYLA
     Yes. I'm immune to its effects.

  LORNE
     (popping more pills) Isn't that convenient?

  TEYLA
     (cautiously) How many of those have you taken?

  LORNE
     Why don't you just let me worry about that, okay?

  TEYLA
     It's the pills. They're what's making you act like
     this. They're confusing you. They're making you
     unstable!

  LORNE
     Making me unstable?! I'm not the one who unleashed
     a disease on my people, okay? Quit stalling. I
     want to know what you were doing in the hall--

  ANNOTATION
     He is shot from behind by a stunner blast. Carter
     wields the stunner. She, McKay, and Zelenka enter.

  TEYLA
     Rodney!

  MCKAY
     Teyla!

  TEYLA
     (relieved) Yes. It's good to see you. Colonel
     Carter, Doctor Zelenka, you as well. How did you
     find me?

  CARTER
     Uh, well, we were having trouble finding you by
     ourselves, so we followed him.

  TEYLA
     Eh, did you finish your work?

  MCKAY
     Wh-what do you mean?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla sighs and moves over to the control panel.

  TEYLA
     Can you disarm the force shield?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay studies the panel.

  MCKAY
     I-I don't know. Wait...

  ANNOTATION
     He looks on his arm and reads some information,
     then presses keys on the control panel. The shield
     deactivates, and the door opens. Teyla steps out.

  TEYLA
     Quickly.

  ANNOTATION
     She leads them out.


LOCATION--NEW LANTIA MAINLAND, DUSK

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon runs back to the jumper with two full bags
     of plants. He finds the ramp down, with no
     Sheppard in sight. He groans in frustration and
     checks inside the jumper, dropping his bags and
     priming his gun. As he steps out, Sheppard comes
     up from behind where he's been hiding next to the
     vehicle. He raises his pistol.

  SHEPPARD
     Don't move! Drop it.

  ANNOTATION
     Angry, Ronon complies, raising his hands in
     surrender.

  SHEPPARD
     Now back away.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon takes a few steps and turns. Sheppard
     reaches down and grabs Ronon's gun, keeping his
     pistol trained on Ronon the whole time.

  SHEPPARD
     Now. Tell me. Who the hell are you?

  RONON
     I know you don't remember everything. You have no
     idea what's going on. You're confused. Maybe even
     a little scared. I know I would be. But you have
     to trust me.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard cocks his pistol.

  RONON
     We're friends! The things we've been through
     together...I don't care what anyone says, no
     disease can wipe that away, not completely. Okay?
     Deep down, you know I'm telling the truth. Now
     give me the gun.

  ANNOTATION
     While Ronon's been speaking, Sheppard's been
     giving careful thought to what he says. His pistol
     lowers slightly. But at the last sentence,
     Sheppard raises it again, alert.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, nice try. For all I know, you're the one who
     tied me up.

  RONON
     Fine. Then shoot me. Then you'll be all alone, in
     the middle of a dark forest with no idea who you
     are, where you're going, or what you're gonna do
     next. How could I possibly make it any worse?

  SHEPPARD
     That's a good point.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon smiles and motions to lower the gun.
     Sheppard uncocks his weapon.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla leads the others inside.

  TEYLA
     Here. Sit.

  MCKAY
     Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?

  TEYLA
     I do not know how.

  MCKAY
     Oh, and I do?

  TEYLA
     Yes! You created the override program. You said
     you were almost finished.

  MCKAY
     (desperate, sarcastic) Oh, then it should be easy.

  TEYLA
     (encouraging) Rodney, listen to me. You must do
     this, it is our only chance. The knowledge is
     inside you, you just have to find it.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks at the computer, then presses Enter.
     The program runs, then a screen says "Program
     Complete."

  MCKAY
     Oh. Wow.

  ZELENKA
     He did it.

  MCKAY
     When I said I was almost finished, I-I guess I
     wasn't kidding.

  CARTER
     Now what?

  TEYLA
     Well, now, we just have to hope that Colonel
     Sheppard and Ronon completed their side of the
     mission.

  MCKAY
     Right...right.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Zelenka, and McKay all turn to Teyla.

  CARTER, MCKAY, AND ZELENKA
     Who?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  KEMP
     What is it?

  MARINE THREE
     A ship. Headed for the bay doors on the roof.

  KEMP
     Have they identified themselves?

  MARINE THREE
     No, sir. It could be help.

  KEMP
     It could also be some kind of an attack. Get in
     touch with the others. Tell them to meet me at the
     jumper bay. Find Major Lorne!

  ANNOTATION
     He heads out.


LOCATION--JUMPER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon's jumper lands on the floor of
     the bay.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  RONON
     Nice flying.

  SHEPPARD
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs the sacks as the doors open.

  RONON
     Come on, help me with the stuff. We've got to get
     it to Teyla straight away.

  SHEPPARD
     Who?

  RONON
     Come on.


LOCATION--JUMPER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     They exit and are instantly stopped by the Kemp
     and his men, weapons raised.

  KEMP
     Hands in the air. Now.

  RONON
     Listen, Lieutenant, this is medicine. We need to
     deliver it.

  KEMP
     I said, hands in the air.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is pulled aside by a soldier. A
     frustrated Ronon throws down his sacks and raises
     his hands.

  KEMP
     Let's take them to the brig.

  RONON
     You're making a mistake. There are sick people who
     need that.

  SHEPPARD
     (low to Ronon) You sure you know what you're
     doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne arrives.

  LORNE
     What the hell is going on here?

  KEMP
     Sir. We caught these men trying to infiltrate the
     base.

  RONON
     Lorne, you have got to listen to me. Everybody on
     this base is going to die if you don't.

  LORNE
     And who are you?

  RONON
     Look in your pocket.

  LORNE
     What?

  RONON
     Just look in your vest pocket!

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne looks in the pocket that Ronon indicates. He
     pulls out a picture. It's a Polaroid of Sheppard.
     Underneath is written: "Lt. Col John Sheppard. He
     is your commanding officer. Trust him."

  RONON
     You took a picture of him, just in case it came to
     this. I was there.

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne compares the picture to Sheppard.

  LORNE
     He's telling the truth. This is our commanding
     officer.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard looks nonplussed, but rolls with the
     change in fortune.

  SHEPPARD
     That's right. I am your commanding officer.
     So...you should do what I say.

  LORNE
     Yes, sir. What are your orders?

  SHEPPARD
     (after a pause, indicating Ronon) Do what he says.

  RONON
     Gun.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard hands back Ronon's weapon. Ronon picks
     up the sacks of plants.

  RONON
     Follow me.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard wakes up slowly in an infirmary bed.
     Teyla and Ronon are by his side.

  TEYLA
     Colonel, you're awake.

  SHEPPARD
     (groggily) Mmm. What happened?

  RONON
     Teyla distributed the plant through the
     ventilation system. Knocked you out for a bit.

  SHEPPARD
     How long have I been asleep?

  RONON
     'Bout a day.

  SHEPPARD
     A day?!

  RONON
     Hit some people harder than others.

  TEYLA
     How you feeling, John? How's your memory?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, pretty good, I think. I mean...things are a
     little fuzzy. If I forget your birthday next
     year...

  TEYLA
     (smiling) I will forgive you. When you are feeling
     well enough, Major Lorne wishes to speak with you.
     He feels badly about what happened.

  SHEPPARD
     It wasn't his fault. Just glad he still had the
     photo I gave him.

  RONON
     That was good thinking, by the way.

  TEYLA
     Yes. If the distribution of the cure had been
     delayed any longer, many more people would have
     died.

  SHEPPARD
     (worried) What do you mean? (looking around)
     Where's McKay?

  ANNOTATION
     In another section of the infirmary. McKay has his
     head down on Katie's bed while he holds her hand.
     She is unconscious. Keller comes over.

  KELLER
     You should get some sleep.

  ANNOTATION
     He raises his head.

  MCKAY
     It's okay. I'm...fine.

  KELLER
     I can let you know when she wakes up.

  MCKAY
     I'll stay.

  KELLER
     Okay. She's not giving up, you know. She's a
     fighter.

  ANNOTATION
     She rubs his arm, then walks away. McKay notices
     her hand shifting on his.

  MCKAY
     Katie?

  ANNOTATION
     Katie stirs slightly.

  MCKAY
     Doctor?!

  ANNOTATION
     Keller rushes back.

  MCKAY
     She's moving her fingers.

  KELLER
     Katie? Katie! Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie awakens.

  KATIE
     Wha--where am I?

  KELLER
     You're in the infirmary. You're safe. Do you
     remember anything?

  KATIE
     Um... (she spots McKay) Rodney? It's good to see
     you.

  MCKAY
     (relieved) Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes her hand.
