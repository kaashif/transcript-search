<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>MCKAY: (recorded video) All right, look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that. You need to focus! I'm sure you're wondering...who tied you to the desk. Well, the truth is...it was you. I mean...me. I did it because I needed you to get this message. It would take too long to give you the full explanation, and you wouldn't remember it anyway, so you're just gonna have to just trust me on this. Now, you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair. Find it and cut yourself loose.</td></tr>

I don't know. You just have to keep looking. Don't worry about anything else. And for god's sake, don't trust anyone. Just find her, and do it fast, because if you don't, hundreds of people are going to die, including you.</td></tr>
