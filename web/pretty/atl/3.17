LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Doctor Hewston walk down a corridor.
     Both are dressed in workout clothes. The corridor
     is crowded with people out of uniform walking
     around.

  TEYLA
     I could never just say that to him.

  HEWSTON
     Why not? You like him, don't you?

  TEYLA
     That is not the point.

  HEWSTON
     I think that's exactly the point, actually.

  TEYLA
     The ways of my people are...different. I would
     never--

  HEWSTON
     Uh, he's not going to make the first move.

  TEYLA
     Uh, we shall see.

  HEWSTON
     Look, you know him better than I do...

  TEYLA
     (primly) I would hope so.

  HEWSTON
     But...I wouldn't be surprised if he was oblivious
     to the whole situation.

  TEYLA
     It bears no further discussion.

  HEWSTON
     All right... I'm just saying, if you want me to
     have somebody drop some hints, I could--

  TEYLA
     (interrupting) Can you remember the last time so
     many people had the day off?

  HEWSTON
     Yeah, it's all Heightmeyer's doing. She insisted
     that the brass order some sort of "mandatory rest
     day". I guess downtime here doesn't really happen
     organically. Hey, and don't think I haven't
     realized you've changed the subject.

  TEYLA
     My people have a day of rest every four nights.

  HEWSTON
     (intrigued) Ooh, now, that is civilized.

  TEYLA
     Yes.

  HEWSTON
     Hey, want to grab a late lunch?

  TEYLA
     I would like that. (stopping short) I forgot my
     bantos rods at the gym.

  HEWSTON
     Oh.

  TEYLA
     Can I meet you there?

  HEWSTON
     Sure.

  TEYLA
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     They part ways. Teyla starts walking back. As she
     turns the corner, a fireball explosion rips
     through the corridor from behind, knocking Teyla
     to the floor.

  TEYLA
     Oh!

  ANNOTATION
     The hallway is filled with smoke and flames.
     People scream in pain and fear as a klaxon blares
     overhead. One man runs down the hall; he is
     aflame. Teyla moans, gasping for air. A piece of
     shrapnel is imbedded in her abdomen. She falls
     unconscious.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  THREE HOURS EARLIER



LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Branton walks into Weir's office. Weir works at
     her computer.

  BRANTON
     Hi.

  WEIR
     (distracted) Hi.

  BRANTON
     What are you, uh, what are you doing here?

  WEIR
     (smiling) I work here.

  BRANTON
     But it's our day off.

  WEIR
     Well, shouldn't you be enjoying your leisure time,
     then?

  BRANTON
     I got a little behind on my research this week.
     Just wanted to drop off some results for the next
     Earth transmission.

  WEIR
     Right. Good.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes back to typing.

  BRANTON
     I was thinking about grabbing some food. Care to
     join?

  WEIR
     (uncomfortable) I can't, I've--

  BRANTON
     You're not capable of having lunch?

  WEIR
     (laughing, self-conscious) Yes, I'm capable.

  BRANTON
     Are you planning on eating today?

  WEIR
     Of course.

  BRANTON
     Great. Eat with me.

  WEIR
     Look, it's nothing personal, but I make it a point
     to not have relationships with people who work for
     me.

  BRANTON
     I don't work for you.

  WEIR
     I'm your boss. Hmm?

  BRANTON
     Well, you're my boss's...boss, actually.

  WEIR
     Still, however indirectly...

  BRANTON
     Yeah, but with that thinking, everyone on this
     entire planet works for you. You're not going to
     be friends with any of them?

  WEIR
     Friends is one thing...

  ANNOTATION
     Nervously, she goes back to typing.

  BRANTON
     Oh, you think...oh, wait a second. I-I see what's
     happening here. You think I'm asking you out on a
     date. No, no, no, no, th-this isn't a date. This
     is-this is lunch. (sitting) This is the--the
     mandatory refueling of our bodies. This is you
     know, putting food in your mouth and chewing it,
     and having something more engaging than a wall
     sitting across from you. That's all it is. I mean,
     come on. You've got to admit--I am much more
     appealing than a wall, no?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir smiles with an arced eyebrow.

  BRANTON
     No, you don't have to...admit it, but it would be
     a massive blow to my ego if you thought otherwise.

  WEIR
     You are more appealing...than a wall.

  BRANTON
     Great. Now, what say we go grab some grub?

  WEIR
     Oh, I still have an hour of work to do, and--

  BRANTON
     (cutting her off) An hour, then. I'll see you in
     the mess hall.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves. Weir sighs in obvious uncertainty.


LOCATION--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     The doorbell chimes. Teyla goes to answer it and
     finds Weir standing in her doorway.

  TEYLA
     Elizabeth, you're early! Just give me a moment.

  WEIR
     Um, how set on lunch were you today?

  TEYLA
     (rolling her eyes) Why?

  WEIR
     Well, something's come up.

  TEYLA
     (sighing, frustrated) Elizabeth, surely whatever
     work it is you feel you must get done can wait.

  WEIR
     I was invited to lunch by Mike Branton.

  TEYLA
     (with sly grin) Oh, really?

  WEIR
     You and I, we had plans, and--

  TEYLA
     (interrupting) My friend, Dr. Hewston, just
     radioed me. She wants me to teach her some bantos
     fighting this afternoon, so...do not worry. I will
     have something to occupy my time.

  WEIR
     Okay...Are you sure?

  TEYLA
     (firmly) Yes.

  WEIR
     Okay. Hmph.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir opens the door and looks back at Teyla with a
     nervous smile. Teyla giggles.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Weir encounters Beckett near the gate room and
     they walk towards the steps together. Weir has
     changed out of her uniform into a green low cut
     top and pants. Beckett wears a fishing vest over
     his long-sleeved t-shirt.

  BECKETT
     Hello. Oh! Don't you look lovely.

  WEIR
     Thank you, Carson.

  BECKETT
     It's the first time I've seen you out of your base
     uniform in quite some time now.

  WEIR
     No, I don't-don't know about that.

  BECKETT
     Off somewhere special?

  WEIR
     No, just getting some lunch.

  BECKETT
     Ah... Rodney and I are going fishing on the
     mainland this afternoon.

  WEIR
     I know, I cleared the use for the jumper.

  BECKETT
     Care to join us? Who knows what kind of wonderful
     fish we'll find?

  WEIR
     That's very kind, but some other time, maybe.

  ANNOTATION
     He stops her with a hand on her arm.

  BECKETT
     (teasing) Oh! What, do you have a hot date?

  WEIR
     (flustered) What? Who told you that?

  BECKETT
     (grinning) No one. I was joking. I was right. Who
     is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir glares at him.

  BECKETT
     None of my business. Have a lovely afternoon,
     Elizabeth.

  WEIR
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts jogging up the stairwell, leaving
     Beckett down below.

  BECKETT
     (teasing) You smell good, too!

  WEIR
     (sing-song) Shut up!

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett chuckles.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Branton sit across from each other at a
     table.

  BRANTON
     Do you believe that?

  WEIR
     Yes.

  BRANTON
     Truly and in your heart, you believe that?

  WEIR
     I do.

  BRANTON
     (scoffing) Oh!

  WEIR
     What?

  BRANTON
     I just don't know that I can ever respect you
     again.

  WEIR
     Come on.

  BRANTON
     You think When Harry Met Sally is better than
     Annie Hall? You're a crazy person.

  WEIR
     It is.

  BRANTON
     Okay... When Harry Met Sally is essentially a
     remake, a cheap imitation, a bad cover-song
     version of Annie Hall. You realize that, right?

  WEIR
     (shrugging, mouth full) I disagree.

  BRANTON
     I know you do, but that's what makes you crazy.

  WEIR
     Well, I guess this will never work out, then.

  BRANTON
     This?

  WEIR
     (nervous) Lunch?

  BRANTON
     Ah. Now does that mean that--that you don't
     believe that men and women can be friends?

  WEIR
     I never said that.

  BRANTON
     Mm, you didn't have to say it. Any lady that likes
     When Harry Met Sally that much thinks men and
     women can't be friends.

  WEIR
     Fine. Maybe I do.

  ANNOTATION
     She smiles flirtatiously before taking a drink of
     water.

  BRANTON
     So where does that leave me?

  WEIR
     I guess that leaves you at lunch.

  ANNOTATION
     He stands and beckons with his head.

  BRANTON
     Come on.

  WEIR
     Where?

  BRANTON
     If lunch is all I get, I'm going to get as much
     bang for my buck as possible.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ALCOVE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Branton sit on a bench overlooking the
     water. Their water bottles are with them.

  WEIR
     It really is beautiful here, isn't it?

  BRANTON
     Yeah. All done?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir takes a last swig of her water bottle.

  WEIR
     All done.

  BRANTON
     (sighing) I guess lunch is over.

  WEIR
     I guess it is.

  BRANTON
     I should have brought dessert. It would've lasted
     longer.

  ANNOTATION
     He stares at her. She holds his gaze for a moment,
     then looks away.

  WEIR
     I should really get back anyway.

  BRANTON
     Well, what are you doing tomorrow?

  WEIR
     Mike--

  BRANTON
     No, I like you, and I'm extremely charming. Heh.
     I'd like to see you spin those into negatives.

  WEIR
     I just don't think--

  BRANTON
     (interrupting) It's probably best you don't think.

  WEIR
     Would you stop interrupting me? You have a
     tendency to do that.

  BRANTON
     (laughing) I do not.

  WEIR
     Yes, you do. I hate it when people interrupt me.

  BRANTON
     Well, if I hadn't interrupted you, we would never
     have had lunch. Life needs a little interrupting
     every now and again.

  WEIR
     All right, I don't completely disagree.

  ANNOTATION
     Branton kisses Weir. She returns the kiss, then
     leans back.

  BRANTON
     (nervous) Was that...way out of line?

  ANNOTATION
     She stares at him and stands.

  WEIR
     I can't do this.

  BRANTON
     Just because we work together?

  WEIR
     This would split my focus.

  BRANTON
     Give it a chance, see if it--

  WEIR
     (cutting him off) I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have
     done this in the first place. I thought maybe I--

  TECHNICIAN
     (over intercom) Dr. Weir, please report to the
     control room immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     She shrugs and leaves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir enters. Everyone is moving frantically
     around, trying to restore order.

  WEIR
     What's going on?

  CHUCK
     There's been an explosion at the base of the
     tower, near the gym. Early reports have at least
     three dead, and there's about a dozen or so that
     are severely injured.

  WEIR
     An explosion? Was there some sort of equipment
     malfunction?

  CHUCK
     No, we're still going over the data logs, but
     we're pretty sure it wasn't a malfunction.

  WEIR
     So it could have been a bomb?

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck nods.

  FIVE HOURS EARLIER


  ANNOTATION
     Teyla walks down a corridor. Sheppard and Ronon
     spot her. Sheppard wears a black polo shirt and
     khaki slacks, and carries a golf club.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, hey, there you are. Been looking all over for
     you.

  TEYLA
     Oh?

  SHEPPARD
     What, did you forget?

  TEYLA
     Uh, no.

  SHEPPARD
     (affronted) You forgot!

  TEYLA
     You were going to teach Ronon and myself how to
     play golf.

  SHEPPARD
     (smiling) That's the plan.

  TEYLA
     I'm afraid I have made other plans.

  SHEPPARD
     What other plans?

  TEYLA
     Having lunch with Elizabeth.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, you've still got time.

  TEYLA
     (thinking quickly) Yes, true. However, I am afraid
     I have been...quite delinquent in filing my
     mission reports. I had hoped to get caught up
     before I met with Elizabeth.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon exchange skeptical looks.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay.

  TEYLA
     If you would like, I could cancel...

  SHEPPARD
     No. No, no, no. She could use a little time out of
     the office. Some other time.

  TEYLA
     Some other time.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla slaps Ronon on the arm as she passes. Ronon
     watches her leave enviously.

  RONON
     You know, uh, John, I got mission reports, too...

  SHEPPARD
     Nice try. It's going to be fun.

  RONON
     (dubious) Fun? Uh-huh.

  ANNOTATION
     He follows Sheppard slowly out of the area.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A golf ball lands in the water near the base.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS DRIVING RANGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard has set up a driving range off one of the
     piers of Atlantis. He and Watson each are using
     the tees. Ronon stands at the back of the room,
     leaning on Sheppard's golf bag.

  WATSON
     Nice shot.

  SHEPPARD
     Thank you...Jim. It was pretty nice, though, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Watson drives a ball.

  RONON
     (bored) So that's the sport? You just hit a little
     ball as far as you can?

  SHEPPARD
     First, it's a game, and, no, it's a little more
     complicated than that. See, there are eighteen
     holes, all made up of varying lengths and
     dimensions. First goal is to hit the ball through
     a series of water and sand hazards until you land
     on the green, then you putt the ball into the
     hole.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon flexes a club and steps up to where Watson
     was standing. Sheppard has driven another ball
     while he's been talking.

  RONON
     (indicating the ocean) So, this is a water hazard?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, uh, we don't have a course yet. All we have
     for now is driving range, where you--

  RONON
     Just hit a little ball?

  SHEPPARD
     (reluctantly) Pretty much, yeah.

  RONON
     What's so hard about that?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard hits another ball into the water.

  SHEPPARD
     Well... I make it look easy, but I've been playing
     since I was six.

  RONON
     (unimpressed) Uh-huh.

  SHEPPARD
     So, although it seems simple, developing a sweet
     swing like mine takes years--

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon swings his club one-handed. The ball flies
     out an immense distance.

  WATSON
     Whoa.

  RONON
     (grinning) Like that?

  SHEPPARD
     (dismissive) That was okay.

  WATSON
     Okay?! You can't even see where it landed.

  SHEPPARD
     Well...it's not a distance game, it's an accuracy
     one.

  RONON
     Well, pick a spot, I'll hit it there.

  SHEPPARD
     First off, your grip. It's all wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett enters.

  BECKETT
     Ah, yes, of course. There you are.

  WATSON
     Hey, Doc, I wanted to come see you. I've been
     having this weird pain--

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to indicate a spot on his abdomen, but
     Beckett shakes his head and puts up his hand.

  BECKETT
     (interrupting) Hold on, sorry. Let me stop you
     right there. It's the first day I've had off in
     over a month. Doctor Cole is in the infirmary and
     would be more than glad to help you out.

  WATSON
     Okay. Fair enough.

  BECKETT
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Watson leaves.

  SHEPPARD
     What's up, Carson?

  BECKETT
     Fishing.

  RONON
     What?

  BECKETT
     (enthusiastic) Rodney and I are heading to the
     mainland to catch a fish that seems to be just
     like a trout. Care to join us? Sport of kings.

  SHEPPARD
     I thought horse racing was the "sport of kings."

  BECKETT
     (scornfully) For the boring kings, maybe.

  SHEPPARD
     Carson, you're Scottish. This is your game.
     Wouldn't you rather be on the driving range?

  BECKETT
     Ach, it was never my thing. Come on, last chance.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon exchange unenthusiastic looks.

  SHEPPARD
     I think we're going to pass.

  BECKETT
     All right. But don't be jealous when I return with
     a record-breaking space trout. Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     He spreads his arms wide to indicate a large fish
     while grinning excitedly.

  SHEPPARD
     We'll try to contain ourselves.

  BECKETT
     Oh, aye. Ha.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett leaves. Ronon off-handedly strikes another
     ball one handed into the distance, and drops the
     club.

  RONON
     Time for a real sport. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves. Sheppard tries to copy Ronon's
     movement. His drive barely gets the ball off the
     tee, letting it plop unceremoniously in the water
     close to the dock. Annoyed, he follows.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS WORKOUT ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard has changed into a t-shirt and workout
     pants. Ronon hands him a stick and blue cloth. He
     has his own blue cloth and places his own blue
     cloth to hang out the waistband of the back of his
     pants.

  SHEPPARD
     Grab the other guy's flag, huh? That's it?

  RONON
     That's it.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard tucks his flag into the back of his
     pants.

  SHEPPARD
     No penalties and stuff?

  RONON
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if the other guy pulls your hair or tries to
     bite you?

  RONON
     Bite back.

  SHEPPARD
     Right.

  RONON
     You ready?

  SHEPPARD
     Ready as I'll ever be.

  ANNOTATION
     They duel with the sticks, Ronon easily spinning
     Sheppard and nicking his flag as they pass.

  RONON
     That's one for me.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sighs in frustration and snatches his
     flag back from Ronon's hand.

  SHEPPARD
     Two out of three.

  ANNOTATION
     They get back into position.

  RONON
     Round two. One-handed.

  ANNOTATION
     He places his left hand behind his back.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  RONON
     After every round, the level of difficulty is
     increased. It's to simulate battle. After every
     encounter, there's the possibility of injury.
     Round two-- one-handed.

  SHEPPARD
     Why don't you let me get better at round one
     before we move on to the harder part?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks at him unmoving, with a predatory
     smile.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, round two.

  ANNOTATION
     They battle again, this time with their left hands
     behind their backs. Sheppard holds his own until
     Ronon knees him in the gut, making Sheppard double
     over in pain and groan. Ronon grabs his flag as he
     collapses.

  RONON
     Uh, that's two for me.

  SHEPPARD
     (breathlessly) Three out of five.

  RONON
     You know, I could do this all day. Haven't even
     broken a sweat yet.

  SHEPPARD
     (still hoarse) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

  RONON
     Round three.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon places his right foot behind his left knee
     and balances with his left arm behind his back.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, come on. Oh, you are making this stuff up.
     This is not a traditional Satedan sport. This is
     an excuse to make me look dumb and kick my ass.

  RONON
     (shrugging) If you want to quit...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sighs, puts his hand behind his back and
     awkwardly balances on one leg. They duel again.
     Sheppard actually gets a couple blows in with his
     shoulder, but Ronon counters. Sheppard collapses
     flat onto his back, although this time, Ronon did
     not take his flag.

  RONON
     Ah, sorry.

  SHEPPARD
     (wheezing) This game sucks.

  RONON
     Well, you need to focus.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't know if that's going to be possible again.
     Here, help me get up. I got an idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon pulls him up. Sheppard groans. When upright,
     he smacks Ronon in the shoulder with a stick.

  RONON
     Ow!

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, it hurts, doesn't it?


LOCATION--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon grunts as he smashes an empty beer can into
     his forehead, end on.

  RONON
     Like that?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, you got to hit it...boopm, straight on, hard
     as you can.

  RONON
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon sits on a chair. Sheppard lounges on a
     chaise. They're both snacking on popcorn and
     drinking beer. Sheppard's laptop plays a mellow
     tune.

  SHEPPARD
     You know, this is what I'm talking about. This is
     how you spend a day off. Kick back, eat some junk
     food, listen to some tunes.

  RONON
     You like this music?

  SHEPPARD
     What, you don't?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard holds a ice-gel pack to his cheekbone for
     a moment.

  RONON
     It's fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard browses through a surfing magazine.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm going to stick to golf. Your game's a little
     too much like my day job. So, how long have you
     been here now? A year?

  RONON
     Year and a half.

  SHEPPARD
     Year and a half? You ever hang out with anyone
     else besides me and Teyla? I'm not saying we're
     sick of you or anything. I'm... I don't know. Are
     you dating anyone?

  RONON
     You mean like a woman?

  SHEPPARD
     Or a man?

  RONON
     No. I'm not ready yet.

  SHEPPARD
     Not ready yet? Did you leave somebody behind on
     Sateda?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon nods.

  SHEPPARD
     Wife?

  RONON
     Close enough.

  SHEPPARD
     Sorry.

  RONON
     What about you?

  SHEPPARD
     (chuckling wryly) Yeah? What about me?

  RONON
     When are you getting married?

  SHEPPARD
     I've already done that. Not very good at it.
     Besides... there really isn't anyone here
     that...eh, you know.

  RONON
     See, I always thought you and Teyla would, um...
     you know.

  SHEPPARD
     (smirking) Really?

  RONON
     (smiling) Yeah. Why not?

  SHEPPARD
     (noncommitally) Mmm...

  ANNOTATION
     The room shakes as a distant explosion is heard.
     Klaxons begin to wail. Sheppard and Ronon leap to
     their feet, alert, and head for the door.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett directs medics to carry out Wilson, who's
     strapped to a gurney, badly injured. The corridor
     is dark and still with smoke.

  BECKETT
     Bright lights. Go. Go, move it.

  MAN
     All right, let's get these two to the O.R. right
     away.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Sheppard rush in.

  RONON
     What happened here?

  BECKETT
     Some sort of explosion. At least three dead, maybe
     a dozen or so severely injured.

  MEYERS
     Doc!

  ANNOTATION
     The three hurry over. They see medics carrying out
     Teyla, who is unconscious, on oxygen, and bleeding
     from her wound.

  BECKETT
     Oh, lord. Teyla.

  SHEPPARD
     Is she going to be okay, Doc?

  BECKETT
     She's lost a great deal of blood. I need you to
     get her to the infirmary STAT.

  SHEPPARD
     (worried) Is she going to be all right?!

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett glances at Sheppard, but doesn't respond
     to him.

  BECKETT
     (to medics) Let's go! Let's move!

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell happened here, Radek?

  ZELENKA
     There was an explosion.

  SHEPPARD
     I get that, but why?

  ZELENKA
     Well, I'm not sure yet. I wasn't allowed on the
     scene until the emergency crews cleared the floor.
     What took you so long?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon grabs an extinguisher and puts out a latent
     fire nearby.

  SHEPPARD
     Transporters are down. There's a lot of stairs.

  ZELENKA
     Oh, yeah. McKay is in his lab. He thinks he might
     have a lead.

  SHEPPARD
     What kind of lead?

  ZELENKA
     He didn't say. The good news is, though, the
     structure is intact, so there's no danger of the
     tower falling down. There is, however, something
     very odd.

  RONON
     What?

  ZELENKA
     Well, the few eyewitness reports that we have say
     Dr. Hewston just...blew up.

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell does that mean?

  RONON
     It's not even possible.

  ZELENKA
     Yeah, normally I would agree with you, but from
     what we can tell, she was standing right in the
     middle of the hall here, and just exploded.

  SHEPPARD
     So, what? A suicide bomb?

  ZELENKA
     Well, see, no, that's what I thought too,
     originally, but I've scanned the area with my
     equipment, and there isn't even the slightest
     trace of explosive residue. We have no idea what
     we're dealing with here.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Watson and Hewston stand while McKay, in his
     bathrobe, paces in front of them. Beckett is
     nearby, checking things on his computer.

  MCKAY
     You know. I think I am a pretty easy guy to work
     for. I am usually too busy doing all the really
     important stuff to micro-manage all the little
     things I need you people to be doing. Now, because
     of that, you have a fair amount of freedom. That
     does not, however, mean you can do whatever the
     hell you please. There are rules, there are
     protocols in place, not only to protect this city,
     but your sorry little existences.

  HEWSTON
     Look, If-if I could just--

  MCKAY
     Oh, no, you cannot. You cannot interrupt me, okay?
     I was having a perfectly wonderful dream before I
     got this call, so you can just stand there and
     listen. You were sent on a routine cataloging of
     one of the abandoned Ancient labs, and you
     activate some alien device without having the
     first clue what it was?

  WATSON
     We thought it was a--

  MCKAY
     (interrupting) Yes! Well, you thought wrong.

  HEWSTON
     Yeah, but just the other week you did the exact
     same thing, so I don't--

  MCKAY
     But I am me. If I make a mistake, I can fix it.
     You are you, and when you make mistakes, you don't
     have to fix them. I do.

  HEWSTON
     (defensively) The second we realized it was
     emitting radiation, we turned it off.

  MCKAY
     So what? What, you want a medal? Look, my
     four-year-old niece could figure out to turn
     something off if it was emitting radiation. That
     does not make you smart; that just makes you a
     little less stupid.

  BECKETT
     (sighing) Rodney, be nice.

  MCKAY
     So? Are they going to live? More importantly, can
     I go back to bed?

  BECKETT
     Well, according to their body scan and blood
     tests, they'll be all right, yes. Although you
     should check back in the next twenty-four hours.
     We'll run some more tests, just to be certain.

  MCKAY
     Well, you were lucky, because we are in a place
     where something as simple as flipping a switch
     could domino out into thousands of people dying.
     You need to be more careful. (toning down his ire)
     Okay, just...take tomorrow off, all right?

  HEWSTON
     We already have tomorrow off. It's the mandatory
     rest day.

  MCKAY
     (worried) It is? Already?

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett clears his throat. McKay looks back to see
     him smiling and miming fishing, while pointing
     between them.

  MCKAY
     (muttering) Oh, great.

     McKay checks his breath and grooming before
     opening the door and walking into the lab.

  MCKAY
     Katie? Hello? Katie?

  ANNOTATION
     He finds Katie near some plants.

  KATIE
     Rodney!

  MCKAY
     There you are.

  KATIE
     What are you doing here?

  MCKAY
     Hey, it's your day off. What are you doing here?

  KATIE
     Well, I'm nursing these little baby ferns we found
     on M4L-279. At this nascent stage, they're very
     fragile, and if I leave them for too long,
     they'll... they'll die.

  MCKAY
     (blithely) Ah...so what? They're ferns.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie stares at him, scandalized.

  MCKAY
     Oh...which is to say, you know, you need time off,
     just-just like everyone else does.

  KATIE
     I-I know, it's just that they produce this special
     enzyme that we think might cure leukemia.

  MCKAY
     (impressed) What? These guys? Really?

  KATIE
     (speaking over him) Yeah. So, what are you doing
     with your day off? I thought you had plans.

  MCKAY
     Oh, I do, with Beckett. That's, um, that's kind of
     why I'm here.

  KATIE
     Oh?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I need, um, an excuse to break those plans.

  KATIE
     Um, why's that?

  MCKAY
     Well, because we're going fishing. Yeah, and to be
     honest, I cannot think of a more torturous way of
     spending a day than, you know, up to my...hips in
     water trying to get worms on hooks and, uh, having
     all the time in the world to listen to Carson's
     many views on what I'm sure are a vast number of
     impossibly boring subjects. I mean, it is
     unappealing in...every way.

  KATIE
     (amused) Then why did you say yes in the first
     place?

  MCKAY
     Well, because he said "You want to go fishing next
     month?" It sounded so far away, I figured
     something would come up, I'd be able to get out of
     it, but, uh, here we are, a month later, and,
     uh...

  KATIE
     Nothing's come up.

  MCKAY
     Exactly. So I figured if I told him we finally had
     an afternoon where I could, uh, take you out to
     lunch or...something, then he'd have no choice but
     to let me out of it.

  KATIE
     I can't. I need to baby-sit the ferns.

  MCKAY
     Right. Well...if I had a nickel for every time a
     girl used that line...

  ANNOTATION
     Katie giggles.

  MCKAY
     (inspired) You know what? Let me bring lunch to
     you. We can eat here.

  KATIE
     Rodney, you want to baby-sit ferns with me?

  MCKAY
     Hey, in the battle between ferns versus fish,
     ferns continuously win a decisive victory.

  KATIE
     That would be lovely.

  MCKAY
     Great. Okay. I'll, um...be right back.

  KATIE
     Okay.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie smiles to herself as McKay leaves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     McKay carries two trays with sandwiches and other
     items. He spots Weir lunching with Branton and
     considers this new development. As he grabs some
     water bottles, Beckett enters.

  BECKETT
     Oh, would you look at that? Great minds think
     alike. I thought I'd pick us up some snacks as
     well.

  MCKAY
     Yes. Um. About that.

  BECKETT
     (threateningly) Rodney.

  MCKAY
     Look...here's the thing. You know I would love to
     go with you.

  BECKETT
     No...I don't.

  MCKAY
     I would. I do. I just, um--I ran into Katie Brown,
     and, uh, she started to lay the guilt on, you
     know, how I never get to see her and how the one
     day I get off, I'm jet-setting off to the coast
     to, uh, sport-fish with my best buddy. I mean, she
     and I see so little of each other, I'm not sure we
     even count as a couple. Anyways, look. Um, long
     story short...

  BECKETT
     (rolling his eyes) Too late.

  MCKAY
     I told Katie I would spend the day with her.

  BECKETT
     Oh...All right.

  MCKAY
     Hey, you know if it was anybody else...

  BECKETT
     No, no. I understand.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, next week. I'm-I'm one hundred percent
     there.

  BECKETT
     (studying him) You promise?

  MCKAY
     Absolutely.

  BECKETT
     Okay.

  MCKAY
     And it's still early, so I'm sure you'll find
     someone else to go with you.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs an orange, sandwich, and a water bottle.

  BECKETT
     Oh, you can bet on that. Well, tell Katie I said
     hello.

  MCKAY
     Mm. Will do.

  BECKETT
     Enjoy. I will.

  ANNOTATION
     He nods and jogs away.

  MCKAY

     language of Weir and Branton.

     Hmm!

  ANNOTATION
     Katie and McKay sit on stools by a table.

  KATIE
     This is lovely.

  MCKAY
     It is, yes.

  KATIE
     I got to say, after all the Cadman craziness last
     year, I-I figured there was no chance for us.

  MCKAY
     (nervously) Oh? Huh. Why's that?

  KATIE
     Well, you had another consciousness in your body,
     one that took over during our first date, and made
     you kiss me... I mean, it was...awkward. And so
     you ignored me for a few months.

  MCKAY
     I did not.

  KATIE
     Yeah. Yes, you did. I mean, it-it's okay, I guess.
     I can't imagine going through something like that,
     and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to be reminded
     of it either.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well...it was a-a little weird there for a
     bit.

  KATIE
     But for the last little while, you've really made
     an effort to make time for me. And it has been
     lovely.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay appears touched.

  MCKAY
     It's funny, you know. As much as I hate to admit
     it, seeing my little sister so happy with
     her...family, I-I just, uh...well, it kind of made
     me realize that, uh...well...I'd like to get
     married.

  KATIE
     You would?

  MCKAY
     Oh, no, not to you.

  KATIE
     Oh.

  MCKAY
     Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Not not to
     you.

  KATIE
     (speaking over him) No, I--I think...

  MCKAY
     (speaking over her) Look, I was just-- I mean--no,
     no, no, that was not a proposal. I was just-I was
     just talking.

  KATIE
     Right.

  MCKAY
     You know what I mean? I just don't want you to get
     the wrong-- It's not that I wouldn't be interested
     in-in-in getting married to someone- I mean,
     someone like you... I mean, someone just like
     you...you, even, maybe, one day. I just, uh--

  KATIE
     I know, I know. It's okay.

  MCKAY
     I like you a lot. I mean, I do.

  KATIE
     I-I know you do, and I like you a lot too.

  MCKAY
     I know. And to be honest, I-I-I find that just...
     baffling.

  KATIE
     Oh come on, now.

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, it's other people too. They find it
     baffling, too.

  KATIE
     I guess they just don't know you like I know you.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but you see, that's what scares me. I mean,
     at some point, you're going to know me the way
     they know me--

  KATIE
     (speaking over him) Rodney, I think I know you
     pretty well. There's not a lot of sub-text with
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands and approaches her.

  MCKAY
     I am really sorry that I ignored you all that
     time.

  KATIE
     I bet you are.

  ANNOTATION
     They bend closer; the explosion rocks the room and
     klaxons blare.

     isn't even the slightest trace of explosive
     residue. I have no idea what we're dealing with
     here.

  MCKAY

  ZELENKA
     (into radio) Yes, McKay, I'm here with Sheppard
     and Ronon. What have you got?

  MCKAY
     All right. I'm digesting this as I go, so, uh,
     forgive the rough edges.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you got?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands in front of large monitor with images
     that illustrate what he is talking about.

  MCKAY
     Now, last night, Dr. Hewston and her partner, Dr.
     Watson, were cataloging a new Ancient lab we
     uncovered. They...inadvertently activated this
     machine... Now, it started to emit a very odd type
     of radiation, but they were able to turn it off
     right away. Now, Doctor Beckett examined them that
     night and gave them a clean bill of health, so
     with no immediate "apparent" danger, we, um,
     decided to figure out what the device was, uh,
     well, whenever we had time. That was a mistake.

  SHEPPARD
     What is it?

  MCKAY
     Well, the science of it is, uh, well, it's
     spectacularly complicated, but, um, it appears to
     be a weapon--one created by the Ancients to battle
     the Wraith, and one that was abandoned fairly
     early on as it affected everyone in proximity,
     including Ancients and humans.

  ZELENKA
     Affected them how?

  MCKAY
     Ah, well, long story short: it creates...explosive
     tumors.

  RONON
     Explosive tumors?

  ZELENKA
     What?

  RONON
     Are you kidding me?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay punches up more displays, showing a human
     body.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I wish. It's actually quite ingenious. Look,
     the device emits millions of irradiated particles
     that have been genetically programmed to enter
     into our systems and gather behind the lungs. Now,
     as they go, they collect trace elements from our
     body that they need to, um, complete an explosive
     compound, which, once in place, the tumor reaches
     critical mass...and explodes.

  SHEPPARD
     So, wait. This guy, Watson--

  MCKAY
     (interrupting) Has almost definitely been exposed,
     yes, look, we need to find him before the tumor
     ignites, which could be any minute now.

     know? Heh. No one can really beat me, so I've
     already won a desk fan, Doctor Mallozzi's anime
     DVD collection, and I got a coupon for a free
     Swedish massage from Doctor Ambrose.

     first couple of years on duty, but I've been
     picking it up again. Hard not to, with views like
     that, huh?

     to come fishing with me on the mainland, is there?

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett enters. Cole sits at a station.

  BECKETT
     Slow day?

  COLE
     (surprised) Carson. What the hell are you doing
     here? It's supposed to be your day off.

  BECKETT
     Well, my fishing trip is officially a bust, so I
     figured I'd come in here and actually catch up on
     some paperwork for the first time in over a year.

  COLE
     Well, that's a shame.

  BECKETT
     Aye, it is.

  ANNOTATION
     Cole turns back, wincing and groaning as she leans
     over her computer.

  BECKETT
     You all right?

  COLE
     No, a migraine. It's a bad one, actually. I-I took
     some stuff, but, you know, I can't take any more,
     being the on-call, and everything.

  BECKETT
     You should have radioed me.

  COLE
     You kidding? There was no way in hell I was going
     to let you miss that fishing trip. It's all you've
     been talking about for two weeks.

  BECKETT
     Well, I'm not going now, so off you go. I'll cover
     your shift.

  COLE
     You sure?

  BECKETT
     Aye, there's nothing happening here anyway. You go
     take a horse pill and rest.

  COLE
     (sighing in relief) Oh, you're a lifesaver.

  BECKETT
     I know.

  COLE
     Thanks, Carson. Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     She hugs Beckett.

  BECKETT
     You're welcome.

  LATER


  ANNOTATION
     Beckett wraps an ACE bandage around the ankle of
     an attractive female marine.

  BECKETT
     If you're going to play volleyball, you're going
     to need proper gym shoes.

  MARINE
     I know. I've put an order in for a pair, but it
     takes forever to get things from Earth that aren't
     vital to the success of the missions.

  BECKETT
     Well, you, young lady, are vital to the success of
     the missions, so don't play sports in sandals,
     okay?

  MARINE
     Okay, Doc.

  BECKETT
     All right, we're all done here. We'll fix you up
     some crutches and, uh--

  ANNOTATION
     The room shakes from the explosion, and klaxons
     blare. Beckett instantly springs into action,
     turning to a nearby medic.

  BECKETT
     Meyers, call in every available nurse and doctor
     immediately. You and you, grab two field kits and
     a couple of stretchers and follow me.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs a field medical kit and starts to leave.

  BECKETT
     (into radio) This is Beckett. What happened and
     where do you need me?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett holds a flashlight while supervising the
     removal of injured as Ronon and Sheppard arrive.

  RONON
     What happened here?

  BECKETT
     Some sort of explosion. At least three dead maybe
     a dozen or so severely injured.

  MEYERS
     Doc!

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett walks with Teyla's stretcher as they lead
     her to the infirmary. She regains consciousness
     sluggishly.

  BECKETT
     Teyla...

  TEYLA
     Carson...

  ANNOTATION
     She reaches for his hand, and he grabs it.

  BECKETT
     I'm here. You've been in an explosion, Teyla, and
     a piece of debris has impacted your side. We're
     heading to the infirmary to take it out and patch
     you up. Easy-peasy. I can do this one in my sleep.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla passes out again.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett finishes Teyla's surgery.

  BECKETT
     All right, all set? Thank you.

  MARIE
     I can't believe you got the artery cleaned up.

  BECKETT
     (self-deprecatingly) Well, they typically don't
     make you head surgeon if you're all thumbs.

  MARIE
     You have another patient waiting for you. He got
     his leg cut up pretty bad in the blast.

  BECKETT
     All right, we're all done here. Let's get her down
     to recovery level and get him in here.

  MARIE
     Okay.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     McKay briefs Zelenka, Sheppard, and Ronon.

  MCKAY
     Long story short...it creates explosive tumors.

  RONON
     Explosive tumors? Are you kidding me?

  MCKAY
     I-I wish I was.

  SHEPPARD
     So, wait, this guy Watson--

  MCKAY
     Has almost definitely been exposed, yes. Look, we
     need to find him before that tumor ignites, which
     could be any minute now.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett examines Watson's leg injury.

  BECKETT
     Well, it's not good but it's not awful. We need to
     start right away. What's his name?

  ANNOTATION
     Marie checks her chart.

  MARIE
     Uh, James... James Watson.

  BECKETT
     (surprised) Watson? Poor lad was in here last
     night. Looks like he's had a run of bad luck.

  MCKAY
     (over intercom) Dr. Watson, Dr. James Watson,
     report your whereabouts immediately.

  BECKETT
     Well, aren't you popular? (To Marie) Go see what
     that's about, please.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  MCKAY
     (into radio) He's in the O.R. right now? I need
     you to get Beckett back on his radio.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD

  ANNOTATION
     Marie tabes Beckett's headset around his surgical
     hat and plastic mask.

  MARIE
     It's Dr. McKay.

  ANNOTATION
     She activates the headset as Beckett starts his
     surgery.

  BECKETT
     (into radio, impatient) What is it, Rodney? I'm a
     little busy right now.

  ANNOTATION
     The ensuing conversation switches between McKay's
     lab and the infirmary.

  MCKAY
     (into radio, panicked) Carson! The man you are
     working on right now has been infected with an
     explosive tumor. We think it's what killed Hewston
     and caused the explosion.

  BECKETT
     What are you talking about? That's not--

  MCKAY
     It is possible, Carson. Look, you need to get you
     and your team out of there. Sheppard has an
     ordnance disposal crew on the way.

  BECKETT
     Well, he's too fragile to move right now.

  MCKAY
     He doesn't have to move. You do.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett takes a deep breath, processing this.

  BECKETT
     (to surgical staff) All right, listen up. I need
     everyone to clear the floor right now. I'm
     enacting a Protocol Seven for this entire level.
     Move it, people! (to Marie, pointing to Watson)
     Right, he stays, you go.

  MARIE
     Wh-what about you?

  BECKETT
     I'm staying put.

  MARIE
     Well, then, so am I.

  BECKETT
     Look, I don't have time to fight about this right
     now.

  MARIE
     Then don't. You can't do this on your own.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett goes to a computer and enacts a Protocol
     Seven Lockdown. Klaxons begin to blare. He turns
     to Marie and clasps her by the shoulders.

  BECKETT
     Thank you. All right, let's get the scanner in
     place. We have a tumor to remove.


LOCATION--MCKAY'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard studies a schematic of Atlantis that
     shows a red light on one level of the main tower.

  SHEPPARD
     He's used his authorization code to seal off the
     whole level. We can't get to him.

  ANNOTATION
     The ensuing conversation switches between McKay's
     lab and the infirmary.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Carson, you cannot seriously be
     considering operating on this guy.

  BECKETT
     Exactly how much time do we think I have?

  MCKAY
     There is no way to know for sure. Look, Hewston
     was infected at the same time that Watson was, and
     her tumor's already exploded.

  BECKETT
     (sighing) No time to waste, then. Making first
     incision.

  MCKAY
     Okay, look, this is all very brave and all, but--

  SHEPPARD
     (interrupting) What if the explosion causes
     structural damage? What if the tower comes down
     with everyone in it?

  MCKAY
     Exactly!

  BECKETT
     Sending him to the other side of the city and just
     leaving him there is tantamount to murder,
     Colonel.

  MCKAY
     The man is already dead!

  BECKETT
     Like hell he is.

  SHEPPARD
     Carson, I can't order you to stand down, but--

  BECKETT
     (interrupting) That's right, you can't. Have your
     men standing by. I'll open access to the floor
     once I've extracted the tumor. Beckett out.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay brief Weir.

  WEIR
     How long has he been at it?

  SHEPPARD
     About ten minutes. I got emergency crews standing
     by. Either way, we're covered.

  WEIR
     Can't you bypass his access code?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but that'll take half an hour. Look, if he's
     not done removing it by then, then--

  WEIR
     (frustrated) This is crazy!


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett removes the tumor with forceps and
     carefully places it in an organ transplant cooler.

  BECKETT
     (into radio) Colonel Sheppard...I've extracted the
     tumor, and I'm opening up the O.R. level.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts typing on his computer.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     A bomb expert waits with a sealed unit outside the
     sealed doors to the level. Once they have opened,
     he starts to wheel the container down the corridor
     as fast as he can.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett stares at the cooler.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) He's on his way. Sit tight.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett tears off his surgical scrubs.

  BECKETT
     Damn it. Tell him I'll meet him half way.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Just stay put, Doc.

  ANNOTATION
     He carefully picks up the cooler.

  BECKETT
     The sooner I get this thing out my sight, the
     better. (to Marie) If you'll finish in closing him
     up, please, I'll be right back.

  ANNOTATION
     Marie nods, and watches worriedly as he leaves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett delicately moves down the corridor.

  BECKETT
     Easy... Easy...

  ANNOTATION
     The bomb expert arrives. He signals Beckett to
     stay put as he stops wheeling the containment
     chamber. He takes the cooler from Beckett's hands
     and nods.

  BECKETT
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett turns and walks swiftly back to the
     infirmary.

  BECKETT
     (into radio) We just made the hand-off.

  ANNOTATION
     The explosion happens before the bomb expert can
     open the containment chamber. The ensuing fireball
     engulfs Beckett.

  FADE TO WHITE



LOCATION--BECKETT'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     McKay is dressed in shirt and tie as he sadly
     packs Beckett's personal belongings. He pauses and
     stares at a framed picture of himself with Beckett
     offworld. The door opens, and Ronon enters. McKay
     lowers the picture.

  RONON
     Hey.

  MCKAY
     (swallowing) Hey.

  RONON
     You okay?

  MCKAY
     Hmm...uh...not really.

  RONON
     You need some help?

  MCKAY
     (somberly) No. No, I'm almost done. He didn't have
     a lot of stuff here.

  RONON
     You sending it all back home to his family?

  MCKAY
     Yeah. Well, I mean, we-we will. They don't know
     yet. We're going to send, uh... the body back to
     Earth, and, uh...I'm going to tell his mother... I
     should have just gone fishing with him.

  RONON
     Don't.

  MCKAY
     No, if I'd gone fishing, if I had checked the
     machine, if I hadn't assigned two junior guys to
     catalog the lab--

  RONON
     (interrupting) Rodney, what's done is done.

  MCKAY
     (voice breaking) I know...and, uh...that's what's
     killing me.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts to pack again. Ronon leaves him.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla tries to maneuver herself out of bed, but
     she is still very weak. Watson lies unconscious on
     a bed nearby. Sheppard enters, dressed in his
     Class A uniform, and sees Teyla's movements.

  SHEPPARD
     Where do you think you're going?

  TEYLA
     I would like to go to the memorial.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't think you should be going anywhere.

  TEYLA
     I am fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Her gasp of pain belies that statement as she
     tries to shift her body.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. I'll get a wheelchair.

  TEYLA
     (weakly) No. I would like to stand...as a
     testament to him.

  ANNOTATION
     She stares at Sheppard.

  TEYLA
     How are you doing?

  SHEPPARD
     Me? Fine, but I didn't get major surgery two days
     ago.

  TEYLA
     That is not what I meant.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, it hasn't hit me yet. I'm not looking
     forward to it when it does.

  TEYLA
     I feel a great sadness. He...I feel a great
     sadness.

  ANNOTATION
     She sighs.

  SHEPPARD
     Here, I got you.

  ANNOTATION
     He helps her up and out of the infirmary.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate Room is crowded with personnel, including
     all of Sheppard's team, Lorne, Cole, and Zelenka.
     Weir stands beside a coffin draped in the Scottish
     flag.

  WEIR
     We've said goodbye to a lot of friends today. Our
     mission is a dangerous one. We lose people, a fact
     we're all painfully aware of. But Carson was...I
     can't remember anyone coming to me with a
     complaint against him. Ever. He was a kind soul.
     He was-he was a healer...and he will be very
     deeply missed. George Fabricius said: "Death comes
     to us all, but great achievements, they build a
     monument which shall endure until the sun grows
     cold." Every single life Carson saved is a
     monument to him...and that gives me great comfort.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir composes herself and nods to the balcony. A
     musician begins to play the bagpipes, and Chuck
     dials the Stargate. Once the wormhole is active,
     Cole, Lorne, Zelenka, Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay
     act as pallbearers and bring the coffin home. Weir
     stands by Teyla as they watch them leave.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, SUNSET


LOCATION--ATLANTIS EAST PIER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands alone on the pier, looking out at the
     ocean. Beckett shows up beside him.

  BECKETT
     How'd it go back on Earth?

  MCKAY
     It was, um...it was awful. Your family was
     amazing, though.

  BECKETT
     (grinning) Aye, they are. Good turnout?

  MCKAY
     Oh, packed the church.

  BECKETT
     Oh, that's good to hear.

  MCKAY
     It's not going to be the same around here without
     you.

  BECKETT
     Oh, you're telling me.

  MCKAY
     You know...the universe is a big place. Who knows?
     Maybe we'll...bump into each other again.

  BECKETT
     Aye. Who knows?

  ANNOTATION
     There is a pregnant silence.

  MCKAY
     You were the closest thing to a best friend I ever
     had. I'm really, really sorry. I should have
     just--

  BECKETT
     Hey, this isn't your fault.

  MCKAY
     You're just telling me what I want to hear.

  BECKETT
     Well, that's what best friends do sometimes. And
     in this case, it also happens to be true. Take
     care of yourself, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     (voice breaking) Goodbye, Carson.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett disappears as McKay stands alone on the
     pier.
