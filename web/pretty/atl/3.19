LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS WORK OUT ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon stares down his opponent.

  RONON
     Eyes straight ahead. Focus on me. Never, ever look
     away from your enemy. Shows weakness. Are you
     weak?

  MCKAY
     (weakly) Uh... No?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon faces McKay. Both are holding blunt sticks
     shaped like swords. McKay is dressed in a gii too
     big for him. A protective covering and yellow belt
     are strapped around his waist.

  RONON
     Good. Are you ready?

  MCKAY
     Uh...

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon raises his hand to strike. McKay raises his
     own arms anticipating to counter. Ronon takes
     advantage of his unprotected abdomen and strikes,
     causing McKay to groan and double over.

  RONON
     McKay, what did I say? Don't take your eyes off
     me! Got to anticipate the next move. You all
     right?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay wheezes and groans, unable to speak from the
     blow. He nods and gives the thumbs-up sign. Ronon
     claps him on the shoulder.

  RONON
     All right. Well, I'm trying to ease up so I don't
     hurt you.

  MCKAY
     (voice a whisper) Thanks.

  RONON
     You're getting better.

  MCKAY
     Really?

  RONON
     No.

  MCKAY
     (disappointed) Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     They get back into fighting positions again. The
     door opens, and Sheppard and Weir enter.

  SHEPPARD
     How're the Ninja lessons going, Jet Li?

  MCKAY
     What do you want?

  WEIR
     We lost contact with the Taranans.

  RONON
     You mean the volcano people?

  SHEPPARD
     Super volcano people.

  MCKAY
     What happened to them?

  WEIR
     Well, we don't know.

  SHEPPARD
     Seeing how we lost contact with them.

  WEIR
     They usually check in from time to time from their
     new settlement. We've been sending them food,
     medical supplies.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon signs for McKay to keep his eyes on Ronon's
     own, anticipating the next attack. McKay keeps his
     back to Sheppard and Weir.

  SHEPPARD
     It's the least we can do since getting the Orion
     blown up.

  WEIR
     But we haven't heard from them for a few months. I
     tried to contact them by radio, but no response.

  MCKAY
     Ah, so send a MALP.

  SHEPPARD
     Eh, we just did. Everything looks okay, but the,
     uh, settlement's a couple kilometers from the
     gate, so we don't know anything yet.

  WEIR
     I want you to check it out.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay lowers his hands and turns around,
     surprised.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) What?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon shouts and strikes at that unguarded moment,
     again striking McKay in the shielded part of his
     abdomen. Sheppard winces in sympathy. McKay looks
     up, whimpering, and pantomimes he was supposed to
     keep his eyes on Ronon.

  RONON
     (nodding) Eyes. Yes.

  SHEPPARD
     (drily) May want to change first.

  MCKAY
     (whimpering) Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Weir leave. McKay looks up to see
     Ronon approaching; he flinches, but Ronon just
     claps him on the shoulder as he too leaves. McKay
     sighs.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT



LOCATION--NEW TENARA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team approaches the settlement. It is a
     small town, with well-masoned houses and shops.

  MCKAY
     They've gotten a lot done in the short time
     they've been here.

  TEYLA
     Well, they're hard-working people. I've made
     several trips to assist them in getting settled.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) This is Lieutenant Colonel John
     Sheppard from Atlantis calling anyone in the
     Taranan settlement. Please respond.

  ANNOTATION
     There is no response.

  SHEPPARD
     I thought I'd give it a shot. All right, let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts on his glasses, and they continue to the
     settlement.


LOCATION--TERANAN OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     The team enters an office, filled with furniture
     and equipment similar to Earth in the
     mid-twentieth century. The computers are modern.

  SHEPPARD
     Anybody home?

  MCKAY
     Well, it looks like they abandoned the place.

  RONON
     Well, maybe they found somewhere better to live.

  TEYLA
     They left everything behind. Why would they do
     that?

  SHEPPARD
     Let's get these workstations powered up. Maybe we
     can figure out where these people went.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay checks his scanner.

  MCKAY
     Oh. I got something. A single lifesign.

  TEYLA
     Where is it?

  MCKAY
     It's below us.

  ANNOTATION
     He studies the device, showing a single blip far
     underground.

  MCKAY
     Quite a way below us.

  SHEPPARD
     They built underground?

  TEYLA
     No. One of the previous civilizations that lived
     here was similar to the Genii, living below the
     surface to avoid detection by the Wraith. They
     left behind several underground passages, but the
     Taranans didn't utilize them.

  MCKAY
     Well, someone is.

  SHEPPARD
     How do we get there?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla leads the way.


LOCATION--TERANAN UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon is the last to repel down to the chamber,
     sliding down easily in one swoop. They turn on the
     flashlights on their rifles. The area is a cement
     underground bunker.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay points, and Sheppard leads the way down a
     corridor. The team patrols together, Ronon
     checking a side passage, and watching their rear.
     Teyla opens a door, finding a mucus-encrusted
     large sack.

  TEYLA
     Wait!

  RONON
     Whoa! What is that?

  TEYLA
     It looks like a cocoon of some sort.

  RONON
     What's inside it?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon stoops to investigate.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, whatever it is, it's not inside anymore.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at the empty cocoon. McKay continues to
     watch the single life sign as the team exchange
     worried looks.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir approaches Chuck.

  WEIR
     Has Colonel Sheppard's team dialed in with a
     status report yet?

  CHUCK
     Well, not yet, but they haven't been gone that
     long.

  WEIR
     Go ahead and dial them.

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck does so.


LOCATION--TERANAN UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between Atlantis and
     Sheppard's team.

  WEIR
     (over radio) How's it going there?

  SHEPPARD
     I think I know why we lost contact with the
     Taranans.

  WEIR
     Why?

  SHEPPARD
     They're gone.

  WEIR
     What? All of them?

  SHEPPARD
     Looks like it. The entire settlement is deserted.
     Rodney's picked up a lifesign underneath the
     tunnel, but we're tracking it. We don't think it's
     human, though.

  WEIR
     Why not?

  TEYLA
     We discovered a large cocoon in one of the rooms
     under the settlement. We think whatever hatched
     from it is what we're detecting.

  WEIR
     Did you just say "cocoon"?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, it's like a big, slimy...

  MCKAY
     It's a pod.

  SHEPPARD
     I was going to say "egg," but who knows what the
     hell it is.

  WEIR
     I'm sending in back up.

  RONON
     We can handle it.

  WEIR
     I know you can handle it, but I'd rather be safe
     than sorry. I'll send in a team of Marines to
     assist you.

  SHEPPARD
     (resigned) All right, if you feel the need.

  WEIR
     I feel the need. Weir out.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's lifesigns detector starts beeping more
     rapidly.

  SHEPPARD
     It's a hell of a complex down here.

  RONON
     It's like a maze.

  MCKAY
     We're closer.

  SHEPPARD
     How far?

  MCKAY
     Forty meters? It's stopped moving, so we're
     gaining ground.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard glances back to the rest of his team.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, good. Look, if it makes any sudden
     moves, I want you to make sure that--

  ANNOTATION
     Belatedly, Sheppard realizes that Ronon has
     disappeared.

  SHEPPARD
     Where's Ronon? Ronon!


LOCATION--TERANAN UNDERGROUND ROOM

  RONON
     (coughing) In here.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks disgusted and upset. His teammates
     join him to see the source of his distress. It is
     filled with human corpses piled onto each other.

  MCKAY
     Oh, my God.

  TEYLA
     Taranans.

  SHEPPARD
     Wounds on their neck, all of them. Does this look
     familiar?

  MCKAY
     Looks disturbingly familiar.

  SHEPPARD
     You don't think, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     He looks up, noticing Ronon has once again
     disappeared.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon? (annoyed) Oh, for God's sakes...

  TEYLA
     Ronon!

  RONON
     (calling from another room) In here.


LOCATION--IRATUS BUG LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay join Ronon in this lab.
     Ronon is looking at a table with straps to hold
     down humans. An iratus bug sits in a liquid
     chamber.

  SHEPPARD
     You can't wander off like that. You got to...
     (noticing the room's contents) Oh, no...

  MCKAY
     The Iratus bug.

  SHEPPARD
     I hate those things.

  MCKAY
     That explains why the wounds look so familiar.

  TEYLA
     What is it doing here? Iratus bugs are not
     indigenous to this planet.

  RONON
     Well, somebody brought it here.

  MCKAY
     Let's hope it's the only bug they brought.

  SHEPPARD
     So, some kind of a Wraith experiment?

  MCKAY
     I doubt the Taranans did this to themselves.

  TEYLA
     I do not sense any Wraith in the settlement.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay notices his detector beeping more rapidly.

  MCKAY
     Oh...our little friend is on the move. It's headed
     right for us.

  SHEPPARD
     How fast?

  MCKAY
     Very fast.

  RONON
     It knows we're here.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon heads out to meet the threat.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon. Stun.

  RONON
     (furious) Why?

  SHEPPARD
     Stun!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon sets his gun as they all warily watch the
     room of corpses, looking for danger. McKay's
     scanner beeping quickly. They watch, growing
     increasingly nervous.

  NEGLEY
     (over radio) Colonel Sheppard, come in.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard jumps, startled.


LOCATION--NEW TARANAS FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Negley's team of marines patrols the forest.

  NEGLEY
     (into radio) Colonel Sheppard, this is Lieutenant
     Negley, do you copy?


LOCATION--IRATUS BUG LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between the forest and
     underground chamber.

  SHEPPARD
     (whispering, impatient) Yes, Lieutenant.

  NEGLEY
     Sir, my team has just come through the gate, and
     we're proceeding to the settlement north--

  SHEPPARD
     (cutting him off sharply) Great, terrific. We'll
     meet you there. Right now I need radio silence.
     Sheppard out.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay checks the steady beeping of his scanner.

  MCKAY
     It stopped.

  SHEPPARD
     Why?

  MCKAY
     How am I supposed to know?

  SHEPPARD
     Where is it?

  MCKAY
     Well, I think it's out in the tunnel.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leads the way.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, TERANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team warily goes through the room of
     corpses and out into the tunnel.

  MCKAY
     (whispering) It's close.

  ANNOTATION
     They cautiously move forward. From a side passage,
     a half-man, half-insect creature attacks Ronon,
     pinning him to the wall. Sheppard, Teyla, and
     McKay open fire on it. It screams in pain and
     backs off, knocking down Sheppard. Ronon
     unsheathes his sword and chops off one of its
     limbs. It runs down the hall on its human legs.
     They continue to shoot at it as it disappears down
     the corridor.

  TEYLA
     (to Ronon) Are you all right?

  RONON
     Yeah, I'm good.

  MCKAY
     What the hell was that thing?

  TEYLA
     (looking down) What is that?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon crouches with a sigh and picks up the
     appendage he sliced off. It looks like a forearm
     with a three-fingered insect "hand".

  RONON
     That's a piece of an arm, it looks like.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's hope that slows him down.

  MCKAY
     Well, maybe it'll bleed to death.

  RONON
     Or just grow another arm.

  ANNOTATION
     He drops the arm back onto the floor.


LOCATION--TARANAS SETTLEMENT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Negley's team are still close to the Stargate when
     they hear the wormhole activating behind them.
     Negley turns to spot a dart flying through.

  NEGLEY
     Dart!

  ANNOTATION
     His team take defensive positions and start to
     fire on it, but the dart's culling beam swallows
     them all.


LOCATION--TARANAS UNDERGROUND COMPLEX

  ANNOTATION
     McKay watches his scanner, tracking the creature.

  MCKAY
     It's still moving away from us.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's hope losing a chunk of his arm slows him
     down.

  RONON
     We need to finish it off to make sure.

  SHEPPARD
     Couldn't agree with you more.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, and how are we going to do that? Huh? Am I
     the only one who noticed that our bullets had no
     effect on it?

  TEYLA
     It appears to have a hardened shell on its back.

  SHEPPARD
     (indicating Ronon's gun) Set that thing to "kill"
     again. (into radio) Lieutenant Negley, this is
     Sheppard. How far away from the settlement are
     you? Negley, this is Sheppard, come in.

  MCKAY
     You did say "radio silence."

  SHEPPARD
     (worried, into radio) Negley. Respond!
     (frustrated) Aw, great.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay taps Sheppard on the arm and points to a
     side passage.

  MCKAY
     It's through that doorway.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard heads to a sealed metal door. Getting
     into defensive positions, they open it, then
     cautiously step inside. They find a room filled
     with cocoons.

  SHEPPARD
     This is not good.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck enters the office. Weir is at her desk,
     studying some papers.

  CHUCK
     Dr. Weir, we just received a data transmission
     from the Taranan settlement... Lieutenant Negley,
     checking in.

  WEIR
     And how're they doing?

  TECHNICIAN
     Well, they've contacted Colonel Sheppard's team,
     who are about ten kilometers further inland from
     the settlement. Negley and his team are on their
     way to meet up with them.

  WEIR
     Ten kilometers inland? What are they doing there?

  CHUCK
     Well, they found the Taranans. Apparently they've
     abandoned their settlement for a better location
     inland.

  WEIR
     What about the cocoon, and the lifesign they were
     tracking?

  CHUCK
     There was no mention about it. It was a brief
     transmission. They were almost out of range.

  WEIR
     Okay. Good. Keep me posted.

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck leaves.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon exit the room, rejoining Teyla
     and McKay, already in the hall.

  SHEPPARD
     We searched the whole room. That thing ain't in
     there. Just a bunch of unhatched eggs.

  MCKAY
     Pods.

  SHEPPARD
     Whatever.

  TEYLA
     Is there another way out?

  RONON
     No, that's the only door to the room.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, they must've found another way out,
     because it is still on the move.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard looks up at the ceiling.

  SHEPPARD
     Alien.

  ANNOTATION
     They all stare blankly at him.

  SHEPPARD
     The movie Alien. They use the airshafts to move
     around the ship.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) And then systematically killed the
     entire crew, one by one. Thank you for bringing
     that up.

  SHEPPARD
     (innocently) They didn't kill them all.

  TEYLA
     What do we do now?

  RONON
     Track this thing down and kill it.

  SHEPPARD
     Agreed, but...first things first.


LOCATION--POD ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team sets C-4 explosives on the various
     cocoon pods.

  TEYLA
     The structure is very peculiar.

  MCKAY
     Yeah...I believe the word is "disgusting."


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon unsheathes his sword and looks around.


LOCATION--POD ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla approaches. One of the creatures starts to
     break through, grabbing at Teyla and McKay. They
     both back away, frightened.

  MCKAY
     (panicked) Go! Go! Go! Go! Sheppard! They're
     hatching!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sets the last explosive.

  SHEPPARD
     We're good! Let's go!


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon spins to see Teyla, McKay and Sheppard
     running out. A creature growls behind them.

  MCKAY
     Shut the door. Shut the door!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Sheppard shove the door closed, but the
     creature gets two of its appendages leaning out.
     Sheppard aims his rifle inside the room and fires.
     The creature drops back, screaming. They seal the
     door and run for cover. Once they are a safe
     distance, Sheppard keys his remote detonator.

  SHEPPARD
     Fire in the hole.

  ANNOTATION
     A fireball appears further down the hall where the
     chamber was.

  SHEPPARD
     Everyone okay?

  TEYLA
     Yes.

  RONON
     I'm good.

  MCKAY
     I think you singed my eyebrows. Think you used
     enough dynamite there, Butch?

  ANNOTATION
     The others ignore McKay as they go investigate.


LOCATION--POD ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The room is filled with smoke and debris. The pods
     have been destroyed. McKay looks at his scanner.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     I think we got them all.

  SHEPPARD
     That's good.

  MCKAY
     Except for our armless friend. He's still on the
     move.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's go get him.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard.
     do you read? Negley? Respond. (to self) Dammit.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps they encountered the creature.

  RONON
     And what, it killed all four of them?

  SHEPPARD
     No way. One creature isn't going to take out four
     Marines.

  MCKAY
     It almost killed all of us.

  RONON
     But it didn't.

  SHEPPARD
     We need to find them.

  TEYLA
     If they were alive, we would see them on the
     lifesigns detector.

  MCKAY
     Not if they didn't make it to the settlement. This
     thing only has a range of a hundred meters.

  SHEPPARD
     Where's the creature now?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay checks his scanner and stops.

  MCKAY
     Wait a minute. It's back that way.

  ANNOTATION
     He nods back the way they came.

  SHEPPARD
     Behind us?

  RONON
     You just said it was that way.

  MCKAY
     I did. Well, it was, but it must have-must've
     doubled back.

  SHEPPARD
     Damn air shafts.

  TEYLA
     Obviously it knows its way around this place
     better than we do. Perhaps we should consider
     returning to the gate.

  RONON
     What, you mean give up?

  TEYLA
     No, not give up. We can find out what happened to
     the Marines and request additional backup so that
     we may do a proper search of the settlement.

  MCKAY
     I like this plan. I mean, if we're taking a vote.

  RONON
     (to Sheppard) Sounds like giving up to me.

  SHEPPARD
     Teyla's right. Enough of this cat and mouse. We're
     better off doing a full-scale sweep of this area.

  MCKAY
     Including the airshafts.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, how do we get out of here?

  TEYLA
     This way.


LOCATION--NEW TARANAS CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     The team walks through a forest clearing.

  TEYLA
     In all the worlds I have been to, I've never
     encountered anything like it.

  SHEPPARD
     Did anybody get a good look at that thing?

  SHEPPARD
     Aside from the severed appendage, no. That thing
     moved incredibly fast.

  RONON
     In some ways, it looked almost like a human.

  MCKAY
     If by "human" you mean clad in a grotesquely
     proportioned exoskeleton, yes, very human.

  RONON
     I meant it looked like it had two arms and two
     legs.

  SHEPPARD
     It looked like a giant bug to me. I hate those
     things.

  TEYLA
     If it was indeed a Wraith experiment, well,
     perhaps it was created by combining the genetic
     elements of the Iratus bug with the Taranans.

  MCKAY
     Which is, as we know, exactly how the Wraith
     evolved. The Iratus bug bites human, human DNA
     mixes with theirs, a thousand years go by--Wraith.

  RONON
     So, what, they're trying to create more Wraith?

  SHEPPARD
     That doesn't make any more sense. If they wanted
     to create more Wraith, wouldn't it be easier to
     get a male and female, you know...get a room?

  MCKAY
     It doesn't work that way with the Wraith, all
     right? At least, we don't think it does. We're not
     entirely sure as to the Wraith's reproductive
     methods.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't want to be around to watch that film.

  MCKAY
     Anyway... look. It's probably less likely they
     were trying to create another Wraith than they
     were actually trying to create some kind of a
     hybrid creature, probably to use as a weapon.

  SHEPPARD
     Super-Wraith? That's all we need.


LOCATION--NEW TARANAS STARGATE

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that's the whole distance from the
     settlement, and I don't see any sign of the
     Marines yet.

  MCKAY
     Maybe they went back to Atlantis.

  SHEPPARD
     No, they would've radioed us.

  TEYLA
     They must have encountered the creature. There's
     no other explanation for why they are not
     responding to us.

  MCKAY
     If that thing took them all out, then that is one
     nasty bug...person.

  SHEPPARD
     Dial us out.

  MCKAY
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tries to dial the Stargate. The first glyph
     makes a flat sound. He tries again with the same
     result.

  MCKAY
     No.

  RONON
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay bends down and reaches into the DHD control
     panel.

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     The control crystal's missing.

  TEYLA
     Missing?

  RONON
     We can't dial out?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, fix it!

  MCKAY
     This is not a matter of fixing, okay? The crystal
     is just gone. Someone has removed it to prevent
     anyone else from dialing out.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla sighs in frustration.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael walks down a corridor by the pod room. He
     steps inside and stares in horror at the
     destruction, and breathes heavily with fury.

  RONON
     Stay here?

  RODNEY
     Hey, Elizabeth will wonder why we haven't checked
     in. She'll dial up, get our status, we can request
     backup, also a puddle jumper to come get us.

  SHEPPARD
     We don't know how long that'll be. That could be
     hours.

  TEYLA
     We'll be safe here. The lifesigns detector will
     alert us if the creature's nearby.

  MCKAY
     She's right. We can set up a-- a--what do you call
     it? A-a-a perimeter. Wait it out.

  SHEPPARD
     We're not leaving without those marines. Let's go
     back to the settlement.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teyla exchange looks but follow him
     away.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The team walk down a corridor. Teyla stops, her
     breath quickening.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  TEYLA
     I am sensing something.

  RONON
     Wraith?

  TEYLA
     I cannot be certain.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     No. No, I've still just got the one reading. He's
     still on the move, heading, uh-- No! No, I'm
     picking up another lifesign. It's popped up out of
     nowhere.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows Sheppard the display indicating the four
     of them, and two separate life signs.

  RONON
     How is that possible?

  SHEPPARD
     Maybe one of those eggs hatched.

  MCKAY
     Well, maybe. That, or-or part of this settlement
     is shielded.

  RONON
     Maybe it's one of the marines.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if it is one of those marines, the something
     Teyla's sensing is heading right toward him.

  ANNOTATION
     They head down a staircase. McKay's scanner beeps
     more rapidly.

  MCKAY
     They're close.

  ANNOTATION
     They nervously aim at every opening with their
     weapons as they pass by. Teyla spots something in
     a darkened room and enters to investigate. The
     door shuts behind her.

  ANNOTATION
     The others hear the door slam.

  SHEPPARD
     What was that?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay turns to find Teyla is gone.

  MCKAY
     Teyla!

  RONON
     Teyla!

  ANNOTATION
     They run to the shut door. A pipe bursts over
     them, spraying them in steam. The creature tries
     to attack in the confusion.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla smacks at the door, trapped inside.

  TEYLA

     The creature moves, but does not seem to be able
     to see the team, who don't fire at it for fear of
     striking a teammate with the limited vision.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla pounds on the door from her side.

  TEYLA
     John!

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla can hear the creature out there. Sensing
     something behind her, she spins, her rifle light
     showing Michael standing there.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The creature appears out of the steam. Everyone
     shoots at it. It falls. McKay gasps as they assure
     it's dead. Sheppard uses his combat knife to pry
     open the door. The room is empty.

  MCKAY
     Where'd she go?

  ANNOTATION
     He checks his scanner.

  MCKAY
     I'm reading two lifesigns moving away from us, but
     one floor up, I think, that, or more air shafts.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     They head down the corridor.

  MCKAY
     Wait! They disappeared.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     The lifesigns, they just vanished. I was right,
     part of the settlement must be shielded.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon move faster.

  MCKAY
     Wait, no, we won't be able to track them!


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla awakens to find herself strapped down to a
     table. She does not notice Michael next to her.

  TEYLA
     What...?

  MICHAEL
     This will proceed much more quickly if you don't
     resist.

  TEYLA
     (fearful) Oh...Michael?

  MICHAEL
     Hello, Teyla.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  MCKAY
     You need to aim for the stomach area. It seems to
     be more vulnerable. It's a soft underbelly. You
     were able to kill it when you hit it there before.

  RONON
     (annoyed) Thanks.

  SHEPPARD
     Which way?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. It's not showing me anything. It's
     useless.

  RONON
     This way.

  ANNOTATION
     They follow Ronon's lead.


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB

  TEYLA
     You are the one who's done all this?

  MICHAEL
     "All this"?

  TEYLA
     This...experiment. You murdered those people. You
     allowed those bugs to feed on them.

  MICHAEL
     A necessary step in the process.

  TEYLA
     To create these creatures? Why are you doing this?

  MICHAEL
     Do you not recall our last encounter? How you left
     me to die on that desolate planet? The hive that
     finally rescued me--they could tell something was
     different. They sensed the human in me. To
     them...I was unclean. I barely escaped that hive
     with my life. So now I find myself hunted by both
     humans and Wraith. So you can understand my need
     to protect myself. To...survive.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael goes to a table full of forceps and
     scalpels and other large and sharp instruments,
     picking and choosing. Teyla strains against her
     bindings.

  TEYLA
     It did not have to be like this. You could have
     lived with us.

  MICHAEL
     As a human? My consciousness erased by your
     retrovirus? No. I will live the rest of my life as
     I choose--but I can't do it alone. So, having
     taken my cue from the experiment your people
     performed on me... I figured out how to reverse
     the process...to create a being even more
     formidable than a Wraith. It began with the
     feeding...

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Michael watches as an Iratus bug feeds on a
     screaming Taranan man in the very chamber where
     Teyla now is.

  MICHAEL
     (voiceover) I allowed the bug to gorge itself, to
     absorb as much human DNA as possible. This, of
     course, led to the death of the subject. The
     timing of the feeding was critical, ensuring that
     the bug laid its next egg quickly, before the
     genetic material could filter out of its body.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael discards the body in the room carelessly
     on a pile with many other Taranans the room of
     corpses Ronon discovered.

  ANNOTATION
     Later in his lab, Michael injects serum into the
     eggs. And later still, he watches the pods as they
     develop.

  MICHAEL
     (continued voiceover) The embryo then contained
     enough human DNA for me to manipulate. I
     accelerated the development, augmenting the
     complexity of its physiology. There were several
     adjustments...several mistakes...until I finally
     found the perfect balance between strength,
     agility, and resilience.

  MICHAEL
     A perfect animal to do my bidding.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael gazes rapturously to the doorway. A
     growling can be heard. Teyla, frightened, looks to
     the door. One of the creatures stands there.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the team runs to the end of a
     corridor, where a metal door is sealed shut. They
     can't open it.

  MCKAY
     Must be some kind of security lockdown. Whoever
     took Teyla no doubt triggered it.

  SHEPPARD
     We've got to open this up.

  RONON
     Stand back.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon immediately fires at it. McKay and Sheppard
     can barely duck in time. The blast has no affect
     on the door.

  SHEPPARD
     Jeez! You mind giving us a little more "heads up"
     before you start blasting everything?

  RONON
     You got any more C-4?


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB

  MICHAEL
     I saw how you and your team destroyed the
     incubation room. But don't think that's the only
     one in this complex. And don't think that this is
     the only planet from which I am conducting this
     experiment.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks horrified as the creature moves away.

  MICHAEL
     That's right. Soon, hundreds of these creatures
     will be at my disposal, and their numbers will
     continue to grow--so long as I have human subjects
     in supply. And now that you're here...I do.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael moves away. Teyla tries to get out of her
     bindings.


LOCATION--TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Ronon, and Sheppard take cover at a side
     corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, that's the last of the C-4. Let's hope
     it's enough. Ready?

  ANNOTATION
     He triggers the detonator. Nothing happens.

  MCKAY
     What happened?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard peeks around the corner. The explosion
     finally happens, and Sheppard barely ducks in
     time. The door is blown.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     They run to the broken door and cautiously enter.
     McKay's scanner beeps.

  MCKAY
     Whoa. Serious energy spike.

  RONON
     What does that mean?

  MCKAY
     We've probably just entered the shielded section
     of the settlement.


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     A red light appears.

  MICHAEL
     Your friends are coming for you. They'll meet the
     same fate as you...one by one.

  ANNOTATION
     He nods to the creature at the doorway, who
     leaves.

  TEYLA
     Others will come for us. Dr. Weir will send--

  MICHAEL
     Don't concern yourself with Dr. Weir. She thinks
     your team has met up with the Taranan people, and
     all is well. One of the marines she sent to help
     you was...kind enough to assist me in transmitting
     a message back to Atlantis.

  TEYLA
     (sighing, pleading) Oh...Michael...please don't do
     this.

  MICHAEL
     After what you did to me...twice...how could you
     expect anything less?

  TEYLA
     What happened back on the planet--

  MICHAEL
     (interrupting) No more excuses. Your experiment
     failed. You decided to kill us.

  ANNOTATION
     Michael picks up a small box and brings it over to
     the foot of Teyla's table.

  TEYLA
     We believed we were left with no choice.

  MICHAEL
     And now I'm in the same position. You drove me to
     this.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens the box. An Iratus bug comes out and
     starts climbing up Teyla's body.

  MCKAY
     Oh, my god.

     Sheppard and McKay crouch by the bodies of two of
     Negley's team.

  RONON
     Where are the others?

  ANNOTATION
     He moves ahead.

  RONON
     Sheppard. Over here.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay run ahead to where Ronon
     crouches over the other two dead marines. Sheppard
     pulls Negley's dogtags. There is a chirping of
     insects.

  RONON
     You hear that?

  MCKAY
     Oh, it sounds like bugs.

  SHEPPARD
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     He and McKay head out. Ronon takes the other man's
     dogtags and closes his eyes.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leads the group while McKay works with
     his scanner.

  SHEPPARD
     Put that thing away. I thought you said it didn't
     work in this area anyway.

  MCKAY
     Please, I-I just thought I could recalibrate it to
     take into effect the--

     The creature tackles McKay. Sheppard turns and
     starts shooting at it. Ronon fires at it as well.

     The bug chirps as it climbs up Teyla's leg and
     torso towards her throat.

  TEYLA
     John! John!

  ANNOTATION
     The bug backs up a few steps, frightened by
     Teyla's screams, but hisses and decides to strike.
     Ronon's gun blasts it away. He and Sheppard stand
     in the doorway.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Ronon) Nice shot! (To Teyla) You okay?

  ANNOTATION
     The three men rush in and start to unstrap Teyla's
     bindings.

  TEYLA
     Yes. It's Michael. He is the one doing this.

  SHEPPARD
     (surprised) Michael? Our Michael?

  MCKAY
     He's alive?

  TEYLA
     Yes. He created the creatures, and he's attempting
     to build an army of them.

  RONON
     Where is he?

  TEYLA
     I don't know. He ran off as soon as he heard the
     gunfire.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, we need to come up with the best plan
     here.

  RONON
     The best plan is to kill him.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon starts after him.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, just hang on a sec.

  MCKAY
     Maybe I should check out these workstations. There
     might be some intel...

  RONON
     We don't have any time.

  MCKAY
     (continuing, insistent) ...such as how many of
     these creatures he created, and if they have any
     weaknesses that we might be able to exploit.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. Teyla, you stay with Rodney. Ronon and
     I are going after Michael. We'll stay in touch on
     the radio.

  MCKAY
     Can't. Shielded, remember? Look, the energy spike,
     it fouls with radio communications as well.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, then un-shield it. Let's go.

     Sheppard and Ronon leave. McKay sighs and gets to
     work.

     You go that way, I'll go the other. Oh, hey, wait.
     Set your gun to stun.

  RONON

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we're going to need to question him.

  RONON
     No.

  RONON
     No more talking, no more questioning. I'm going to
     do what we should've done the first time we
     captured him.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon, listen to me--

  RONON
     (interrupting) No, you listen to me, John. This
     whole retrovirus thing was a mistake. I said it
     then, no one listened to me. It was a bad idea.

  SHEPPARD
     We had to try. If it worked, we wouldn't have to--

  RONON
     But it didn't work! Admit it. It just made things
     worse. How long do you want to keep paying for it?


LOCATION--MICHAEL'S LAB

  MCKAY
     It is amazing how much work he's been able to get
     done in such a short amount of time. He's quite
     the industrious little fella...or Wraith... or
     whatever. What does he look like now? I mean, is
     he full-on Wraith again?

  TEYLA
     Not quite. There are still human characteristics
     present in him. No doubt it's why I was confused
     when I first felt his presence.

  MCKAY
     You would think that the human side of him would
     temper his aggression a bit.

  TEYLA
     (sarcastically) Yes...because we humans aren't
     aggressive at all.

  MCKAY
     Well, certainly less aggressive than-- Oh,
     sarcasm. Yeah. Nice.

  TEYLA
     What Michael is doing right now must be stopped,
     and he cannot be allowed to escape. He's far too
     dangerous.

  MCKAY
     Eh, you're preaching to the choir, my dear.

  TEYLA
     But I understand his anger. His life has been
     destroyed. He no longer has a home or a family...

  MCKAY
     He had a family?

  TEYLA
     I don't know. But I've often wondered what he left
     behind when he was captured by us. We know nothing
     of his past, other than he was a Wraith.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay studies Michael's data.

  MCKAY
     A very smart Wraith.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps he was a scientist.

  MCKAY
     Sure. Probably. Why not? One of their very best, I
     would wager.

  TEYLA
     Like you.

  MCKAY
     Right. Wait a minute.

  TEYLA
     What is it?

  MCKAY
     I think I just figured out how to disable the EM
     interference that is causing the shielding. (into
     radio) Sheppard, you there?

  ANNOTATION
     The exchange switches between the lab and the
     corridor where Sheppard patrols.

  SHEPPARD

  MCKAY
     I got the shielding disabled.

  SHEPPARD
     So I see.

  MCKAY
     Any luck finding Michael?

  SHEPPARD
     No sign of him yet. Is that lifesigns detector
     working yet?

  MCKAY
     Oh. Of course.

     No offense, but I was kind of hoping never to see
     you again.

  MICHAEL
     I had hoped just the opposite.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, then. You've seen me. Now, say your
     goodbyes...but first, give me the control crystals
     to the DHD.

  MICHAEL
     I don't think so.

     After all, I'm merely continuing the experiment
     your people began.

     This must be where they got up.

  RONON
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Air shafts. It's about time we used them.

  ANNOTATION
     He and Ronon climb into an air shaft ladder.


LOCATION--TARANAN FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon reach the surface. Ronon blasts
     away some creatures trying to follow them. They
     look around, spotting a dart parked on the
     surface.

  RONON
     Michael's.

  SHEPPARD
     No doubt.

  RONON
     You thinking what I'm thinking?

  SHEPPARD
     I fly it, pick you, Rodney, and Teyla up. We use
     the dart's DHD to dial the gate.

  RONON
     (considering) I was thinking "blow it up," but
     your idea's better. Get moving.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard runs to the dart. Ronon blasts some
     creatures climbing up the air shaft. He hears more
     converging on them in the forest. They appear out
     of the fog, surrounding him.

  RONON
     Sheppard!

  ANNOTATION
     The dart powers up. Ronon starts firing on them.
     The dart culls Ronon.


LOCATION--NEW TARANAS FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and McKay run through the forest. McKay
     checks his scanner.

  MCKAY
     Wait!

  TEYLA
     What is it?

  MCKAY
     Lifesigns up ahead.

  TEYLA
     Colonel Sheppard? Ronon?

  ANNOTATION
     They hear the creatures growling nearby.

  MCKAY
     Doesn't sound like it. Lifesigns behind us, too.
     It's closing in fast. Oh, god.

  ANNOTATION
     The scanner beeps frantically and McKay spots dots
     on all sides drawing closer to Teyla and McKay.

  MCKAY
     We're surrounded.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and McKay stand back to back, searching for
     enemies. Teyla is hit by a Wraith stun blast. She
     falls. McKay turns, but he too is felled by the
     stunner. Michael strides forward. A dart flies
     overhead. It culls Teyla and McKay before Michael
     can get to them. He breathes heavily, looking
     frustrated.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates. Weir approaches Chuck's
     station.

  CHUCK
     Incoming wormhole. Colonel Sheppard's IDC.

  WEIR
     Lower the shield.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The shield lowers as Weir approaches the Stargate.
     Sheppard's team walks through.

  WEIR
     Are you all right? Where are the marines?

  SHEPPARD
     Didn't make it.

  WEIR
     What?

  MCKAY
     We barely made it ourselves. We had to commandeer
     a Wraith dart just to dial out.

  SHEPPARD
     We ditched it on another planet. We didn't want to
     risk damaging the control room. Daedalus can pick
     it up later.

  WEIR
     What happened to the Taranans?

  RONON
     They're dead, all of them.

  WEIR
     Wait a minute. Lieutenant Negley sent a message
     saying they just relocated to a new settlement.

  TEYLA
     No. It was Michael. He sent the transmission. He's
     the one that's killed the Taranans.

  WEIR
     (shocked) Michael?

  SHEPPARD
     We'll tell you about it in a minute, but first, is
     the Daedalus here yet?

  WEIR
     It's still a few days out. Why?

  SHEPPARD
     We're going to need it to make another stop on the
     way.

  WEIR
     Okay.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Weir walks down a corridor, deep in thought and
     looking disturbed. Teyla meets her in the
     passageway and notices her demeanor.

  TEYLA
     Elizabeth?

  WEIR
     I just came from McKay's lab. He's been examining
     the research he was able to upload from Michael's
     experiment.

  TEYLA
     Has he been able to determine just how many more
     of those creatures Michael was able to create?

  WEIR
     Well, not an exact figure, no, but Rodney believes
     it's well into the hundreds.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla gasps in shock.

  WEIR
     Yeah, and it appears Michael has similar labs on
     at least three different planets.

  TEYLA
     It's amazing how quickly he's been able to
     incorporate our science into his.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir is still deep in thought.

  TEYLA
     What is it?

  WEIR
     Michael found out about the Taranan settlement
     through information the Wraith hacked from our
     database during our brief alliance with them last
     year. We led Michael straight to them.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks away.


LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Weir studies a tablet computer. Sheppard enters.

  SHEPPARD
     Colonel Caldwell just radioed. They did a full
     sweep of the planet. No lifesigns. They searched
     the settlement. No Michael, no creatures.

  WEIR
     He already dialed out.

  SHEPPARD
     Yep. Got the control crystal back in the DHD.
     Rodney's trying to figure out the last address
     dialed, but, uh, well, you know how long that
     takes.

  WEIR
     Yeah, I'm sure Michael immediately dialed
     elsewhere to cover his tracks.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, you can count on that.

  WEIR
     We need to find him. He's already too dangerous.

  SHEPPARD
     And I'm sure we're number one on his hit list.
