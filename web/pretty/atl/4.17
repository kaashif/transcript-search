LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--CARTER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla sit with Carter in her office.

  CARTER
     Welcome back, Teyla.

  TEYLA
     Thank you. Believe me, it's good to be back.

  SHEPPARD
     So, what's new on Earth?

  TEYLA
     I...wouldn't know. I saw nothing beyond the walls
     of Stargate Command for two days.

  CARTER
     How'd the interview go?

  TEYLA
     Exactly as you said it would. The new member of
     the IOA, Mister Coolidge? Was somewhat brusque and
     arrogant. He insisted on doing most of the
     questioning himself.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I thought he would. These interviews were
     the first item on his agenda.

  SHEPPARD
     Don't worry, just a new guy marking his territory.

  TEYLA
     Yes, well, he is clearly distrustful of "aliens"
     participating in any aspect of the Stargate
     Program, let alone being active team members.

  SHEPPARD
     But you changed his mind, right?

  TEYLA
     I...hope so. Although he did seem...distracted by
     my current condition.

  CARTER
     (surprised) Really? I informed the IOA of your
     pregnancy.

  TEYLA
     Yes. They knew. And most of the members were
     actually quite supportive. But Mr. Coolidge...his
     demeanor toward women differs from his demeanor
     toward men. He kept calling me "honey."

  ANNOTATION
     Carter groans softly and bites her lip.

  TEYLA
     I admit the urge to inflict harm on this man was
     quite strong, but I managed to refrain from doing
     so.

  SHEPPARD
     Good call. Bad idea to run around beating the crap
     out of people with a baby on the way.

  TEYLA
     In the end, I don't think he'll have a problem
     with me, mainly because I think he believes I will
     not be returning to active duty after my child is
     born.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, won't he be surprised?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla shifts uncomfortably. Sheppard studies her
     reaction with surprise.

  CARTER
     (quickly) Well, we'll cross that bridge when we
     come to it. In the meantime, it's important that
     we get through these interviews as smoothly as
     possible and not create any waves. I'll inform you
     when the report comes in.

  TEYLA
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla leaves. Sheppard stands, but sits again when
     Carter sits next to him.

  SHEPPARD
     Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

  CARTER
     (sighing) Ronon's up next.

  SHEPPARD
     Big waves. We're talking tsunamis.

  CARTER
     I thought about that. Now, his interview's not for
     three days, so I've asked somebody to come to
     Atlantis and..."coach" him.

  SHEPPARD
     Who?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, wearing formal Jaffa robes, arrives
     through the Stargate and looks around Atlantis.
     Carter walks up to greet him, smiling broadly.

  CARTER
     Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     They clasp hands warmly.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter.

  CARTER
     Welcome to Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows. Carter laughs.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c walk down a corridor. She's
     studying his latest hairstyle. He still has the
     silver streak from his aging, but it has grown
     longer now, and is slicked back.

  CARTER
     So, Teal'c, the, uh...hair.

  TEAL'C
     You do not like it?

  CARTER
     No, I love it. It's very...Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     They grin at each other.

  TEAL'C
     This city is much larger than I expected.

  CARTER
     Ah, it's a remarkable feat of engineering. The
     Ancients really knew what they were doing.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles at passers-by and looks at the city.
     Teal'c studies her and gives a faint smile.

  TEAL'C
     You look well, Colonel Carter. Command has been
     good to you.

  CARTER
     Thanks, Teal'c. It takes some getting used to. The
     military protocol's pretty relaxed, but I like it
     here.


LOCATION--WORKOUT ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon spars with a large Marine in hand to hand
     combat, Ronon constantly knocking the other down.
     Other Atlantis personnel are on the sidelines
     watching. Carter and Teal'c enter. Ronon fells the
     Marine for the last time, then adjusts some of his
     dreadlocks out of his face.

  TEAL'C
     Is that him?

  CARTER
     Yep. That's him. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon goes to get something to drink while people
     help the injured man off the mats. Carter and
     Teal'c approach Ronon.

  CARTER
     Ronon Dex, I'd like you to meet Teal'c of the
     Jaffa. He's the one I was telling you about.

  TEAL'C
     (bowing) It is a pleasure to meet you, Ronon Dex.
     Colonel Carter has spoken highly of you.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon is slightly out of breath as he continues to
     drink his water. He studies Teal'c with a scowl.

  CARTER
     (nervously) Anyway...like I said. You two are
     similar in many ways, so you should have a lot in
     common.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c watch as Ronon spits out some of
     his water.

  CARTER
     (continuing gamely) Teal'c was a member of SG-1
     for over ten years, so he knows all about dealing
     with the IOA. Which is why I thought...he could
     pass along a few pointers, help you prep for the
     big interview.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon continues to glare at Teal'c, who studies
     Ronon with an appraising eye.

  TEAL'C
     (blandly) Colonel Carter?

  CARTER
     (sighing weakly) Yeah?

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps you could leave us to become better
     acquainted.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks between them.

  CARTER
     (tensely) Sure. Have fun.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves. They continue to stare each other
     down.

  TEAL'C
     Do you not speak, Ronon Dex?

  RONON
     Not when I've got nothin' to say.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c blinks, considering this, then bows his
     head.


LOCATION--M4F-788, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     In a desert canyon. The Wraith who was part of the
     lab where Todd was held walks towards the DHD. A
     hive ship is in the distance. He is followed by
     other Wraith and some soldier Wraith. One carries
     a large circular device, others carry tendons that
     are the Wraith version of cables.

  WRAITH
     This is it. Get to work!

  ANNOTATION
     They start setting up their device and connecting
     it to the DHD.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon sits alone at a table, eating. Teal'c
     arrives with his own tray full of food.

  TEAL'C
     May I join you?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c sits without waiting for an answer. Ronon
     appears annoyed.

  TEAL'C
     Mm. Salisbury steak. We are often served this in
     the SGC mess hall. I must confess, however, that I
     am partial to the tater tots.

  RONON
     Look. I don't need a coach teaching me how to act
     during the interview. I've dealt with the IOA
     before.

  TEAL'C
     The IOA is comprised of more than just Mr.
     Woolsey. Their new member, Mr. Coolidge is far
     less pleasant.

  RONON
     Yeah, well, I can handle him. I'll stay calm,
     answer all of his questions. I know how to play
     the game.

  TEAL'C
     I am pleased to hear that. Very well. Let us speak
     of other things.

  RONON
     Such as?

  TEAL'C
     Tell me of Sateda.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon stops chewing and glares at Teal'c.

  RONON
     (aggressively) What do you want to know?

  TEAL'C
     When did the Wraith destroy it?

  RONON
     (calming) Years ago.

  TEAL'C
     Your army was unable to fight?

  RONON
     (bristling) Oh, we fought back. The battle lasted
     days.

  TEAL'C
     And when you finally surrendered, what did the
     Wraith do then--?

  RONON
     (hissing) We didn't surrender! We fought until
     every last one of us was either dead or captured.

  TEAL'C
     So tell me then...is it true that negligence on
     your part is what first alerted the Wraith to your
     presence? That your reckless actions brought about
     the deaths of thousands of innocent people--

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon stands and tosses aside his tray in his
     fury. He unholsters his gun and powers it up,
     aiming it at Teal'c's head.

  RONON
     That's a lie!

  ANNOTATION
     While everyone has gotten up, upset and confused
     at the scene, Teal'c has remained seated,
     perfectly calm, and eating a tater tot.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed it is. Yet, should such a question arise
     during your interview, I trust you will not
     respond in a similar manner. You do, after all,
     "know how to play the game."

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and Sheppard enters, taking in the
     scene.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon! Put...the gun...away!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon re-holsters his gun, but continues to glare
     down at Teal'c.

  SHEPPARD
     What's the problem here?

  TEAL'C
     There is no problem, Colonel Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that's good to hear. Ronon?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon leans over the table, menacingly. Teal'c
     stops eating and stares back in challenge.
     Sheppard shifts, sensing the tension.

  SHEPPARD
     All right...why don't you take Teal'c down to the
     gym? Show him your fighting techniques? I'm sure
     you guys could give each other a few tips.


LOCATION--WORK OUT ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon fight in the center of the room
     with large staffs. Teal'c has taken off his robes
     and is in sleeveless top and pants. Atlantis
     personnel line the edges, cheering the fighters
     on. Chuck has a PDA and is collecting money in a
     betting pool. Carter enters and walks over to
     Sheppard, who's watching calmly.

  SHEPPARD
     Colonel? Want to place a bet?

  CARTER
     What's going on here?

  SHEPPARD
     Friendly sparring match.

  ANNOTATION
     They watch as Teal'c and Ronon swing their staffs.
     Neither seem to be holding back, and neither gives
     any quarter.

  CARTER
     Well, it looks anything but friendly.

  SHEPPARD
     Nah, it's good for them. They're just blowing off
     some steam.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon continue to fight at a furious
     pace.

  CROWD
     Go! Go! Go!

  CARTER
     How long have they been at it?

  SHEPPARD
     About an hour or so.

  CARTER
     (incredulous) An hour?!

  SHEPPARD
     They're not even taking any breaks.

  CARTER
     Well, they are now!

  SHEPPARD
     I don't think that's such a...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter jumps into the fray.

  SHEPPARD
     ...good idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon kicks and Teal'c's staff breaks in the
     middle, leaving him with two rods now. Carter
     steps into the fight circle.

  CARTER
     Okay! That's enough!

  ANNOTATION
     The cheering stops and Teal'c and Ronon pace
     around. Teal'c stares at Carter, then drops his
     two sticks. Ronon sneers and drops his own staff.
     Sheppard's eyes widen.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon starts punching Teal'c. After a few blows,
     Teal'c fights back, knocking Ronon to one side.
     Ronon bounces to renew his attack.

  CARTER
     Ronon! Teal'c! Stop!

  ANNOTATION
     She steps between them and physically holds them
     apart.

  SHEPPARD
     (disappointed) Well.

  CARTER
     Let's call it a draw.

  ANNOTATION
     The crowd dissipates. Sheppard takes some Canadian
     money from Chuck's hand, leaving him a small bill,
     then walks away himself.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c, now back in his Jaffa robes,
     walk down a corridor. Not in hearing distance,
     Sheppard walks with Ronon. He points to Teal'c.

  RONON
     (petulantly) Why does he have to go with me?

  SHEPPARD
     He's not actually going with you. He's returning
     home. He just happens to be traveling at the same
     time. One less dial-in on the intergalactic
     bridge.

  RONON
     That's the other thing. Why don't we just dial
     Earth directly from here?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we need a ZPM for that, and we don't want to
     waste the extra power. That was the whole point of
     the Gate Bridge in the first place.

  RONON
     But there's a twenty-four hour quarantine on the
     Midway Station.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon pause at the door to the Gate
     Room. Teal'c and Carter already stand before the
     Stargate.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, you're just going to have to sit around for
     a bit, all right? Look, the guy's got years of
     experience. He's like a hundred years old or
     something, all right? It won't kill you to listen
     to him. Be a good boy.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard walks away.

  RONON
     I hate you.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  CARTER
     I'm sorry about breaking up the sparring match
     earlier. But if I didn't, you two would probably
     still be fighting.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods and bows.

  CARTER
     Listen, I know that Ronon's been resistant, but I
     really appreciate you coming here and helping us
     out.

  RONON
     I too wish him to succeed. There is great
     potential in him.

  CARTER
     I agree.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon approaches.

  CARTER
     (to Ronon) All set?

  RONON
     Let's get this over with.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c exchange looks, she with a
     too-bright smile.

  CARTER
     (calling to Control Room) Dial the bridge, Chuck.

  CHUCK
     Yes, ma'am.

  TEAL'C
     It gives me great pride to see how the people of
     this expedition have embraced you as their leader.
     As I knew they would.

  CARTER
     Thanks, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     They embrace. Ronon rolls his eyes and looks away.


LOCATION--M4F-788, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates as the Wraith recheck the
     tendon cables.

  WRAITH AIDE
     The portal's activating. The patterns are stored
     in the buffer. The portal should redial
     momentarily.

     [Teal'c and Ronon step onto the ramp. Two guards
     stand nearby. The Milky Way Stargate is at the the
     other side of the room.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lee watches Teal'c and Ronon through a window.
     Kavanaugh and Dempster sit at separate control
     consoles.

  LEE
     (to Kavanaugh) Right on schedule. I'm gonna go get
     them settled in. You can get started on the
     attitude stabilization diagnostics.

  KAVANAUGH
     I thought Dempster was doing that.

  DEMPSTER
     Why do I have to do that?

  LEE
     You don't. I want you to do it.

  ANNOTATION
     He points at Kavanaugh.

  KAVANAUGH
     I just finished five hours of power distribution
     upgrades!

  LEE
     You chose to be here.

  KAVANAUGH
     No, I didn't.

  LEE
     Yes, you did.

  KAVANAUGH
     No, I didn't!

  LEE
     Regardless...I want you to learn everything there
     is to know about this station. And the sooner you
     do that, the sooner I get to hand you reins and go
     home.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee leaves.

  KAVANAUGH
     (petulant) You're not the only one who wants to go
     home.

  LEE
     (calling back) I heard that!


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Lee meets Teal'c and Ronon in the corridor.

  LEE
     (brightly) Gentlemen! Welcome to the Midway
     Station, halfway point between the Pegasus and
     Milky Way galaxies.

  RONON
     Yeah, we know. We've been here before.

  LEE
     (nervously) Right. Of course. So then you also
     know about the twenty-four hour quarantine before
     we can let you carry on to Earth? Don't want to
     pass on any of those pesky Pegasus germs to the
     folks back home... (clears throat) Why-why don't I
     just show you to your quarters? Um, unfortunately,
     you're gonna have to share. As you know, there's
     not much room on the station.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION GUEST QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Lee opens a door. It has a bunk-bed, a small
     table, a toilet and sink. Teal'c looks around
     practically in horror at how small it is. Ronon
     looks annoyed.

  LEE
     There's a dvd player and a few movies. Oh, we saw
     Norbit the other day? It's actually--it's kind of
     funny. Um, there's some sudoku books...although I
     think--no, they're all solved. Um, yeah, like I
     said, it-it-it's a bit small, but uh, you're only
     here for a day, so kick back, relax, have a-have
     an Earl Grey and get to know each other
     better...or not.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee is squeezed between the much larger Teal'c and
     Ronon. As they look at their cramped quarters, Lee
     is pressed between them while he speaks. Lee is
     able to maneuver to the door and makes a hasty
     retreat. Ronon and Teal'c glare at each other a
     few moments, then both move to take the bottom
     bunk. They stand as one and stare each other down
     again.


LOCATION--M4F-788, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith aide finishes typing on his console.

  WRAITH AIDE
     I have deciphered the program.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee rejoins Kavanaugh and Dempster.

  LEE
     How's it going?

  KAVANAUGH
     (dully) Peachy.

  LEE
     You're bored. I get it. Welcome to Midway.

  ANNOTATION
     The Pegasus Stargate activates.

  KAVANAUGH
     Are we expecting another dial-in?

  LEE
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to Dempster's console and keys the
     intercom.

  LEE
     Unscheduled Pegasus activation.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at the computer screen of a camera at the
     Stargate and watches the two guards wait. Wraith
     soldiers come through the Stargate and immediately
     fire at the guards.

  LEE
     What the heck?

  KAVANAUGH
     Oh, God! Wraith!

  LEE
     That's impossible!

  ANNOTATION
     They all rush to the window to see several Wraith
     soldiers coming through the Stargate.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION GUEST QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c stand stoically and watch the
     Three Stooges on the tv screen mounted to the
     wall.

  MOE
     (on screen) Ah, who you hitting?

  ANNOTATION
     Moe hits Larry between the eyes. Larry runs away.

  CURLY
     (on screen) Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

  MOE
     Eh, be quiet.

  ANNOTATION
     Moe smacks Curly up the back of the head.

  ANNOTATION
     Neither Ronon nor Teal'c react to the onscreen
     antics. A klaxon begins to blare. Ronon and Teal'c
     exchange looks. Ronon grabs his gun belt from the
     top bunk, and Teal'c takes off his robe as they
     leave.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Wraith soldiers patrol the halls, shooting the
     guards. Ronon and Teal'c encounter two soldiers;
     Ronon instantly fells them with his pistol.

  RONON
     What are the Wraith doing here?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c picks up their stunner weapons.

  TEAL'C
     I was about to ask the same question.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The blast shield closes over the window. The door
     opens and Wraith enter. Lee finishes frantically
     typing on the console while the other two raise
     their hands.

  WRAITH
     Stop!

  ANNOTATION
     Lee stands and raises his hands in surrender,
     backing away. The aide takes his Lee's place at
     the console and turns off the klaxon. The Wraith
     leader watches the last soldiers enter and the
     Pegasus Stargate shut down.

  WRAITH
     Dial Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee gulps and he exchanges worried looks with his
     colleagues.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard enters. Carter and McKay are both working
     at computers.

  SHEPPARD
     What's going on?

  MCKAY
     (unconcerned) The intergalactic bridge is down.

  SHEPPARD
     How'd that happen?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. We were sending the daily status
     report to the SGC, and we can't connect to Midway.

  CARTER
     Some kind of malfunction, either in one of the
     gates or the call-forwarding macro.

  MCKAY
     Eh, it's probably just a glitch, a simple software
     hiccup.

  SHEPPARD
     Hiccup?

  CARTER
     We hope.

  SHEPPARD
     (realizing) Ronon and Teal'c?

  MCKAY
     (dismissively) Nah, the malfunction occurred
     several minutes after they went through. I'm sure
     they made it to Midway.

  CARTER
     But we can't be absolutely certain.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and McKay exchange stubborn looks.

  SHEPPARD
     Those gates are in space! If they walked
     through...

  MCKAY
     No, no, no. Look, the glitch occurred at M4F-788.
     That is a planetary gate at the edge of the
     Pegasus Galaxy, which means, worst-case scenario,
     they step through the puddle and they find
     themselves stranded on an uninhabited planet.

  SHEPPARD
     Stranded. More time together. Just what they need.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Midway Station floats in space.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION ARMORY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon raid the armory for weapons and
     ammunition.

  RONON
     Oh. All right, we need to secure the gate room.

  TEAL'C
     No. We must get to the control room.

  RONON
     More Wraith can get through the Gate.

  TEALC
     They cannot use the Stargate without the Control
     Room. It is best if we just keep moving--

  ANNOTATION
     He exits the room and meets more Wraith. He shoots
     them both with his rifle. Ronon also fires at a
     pair coming from a different direction.

  TEAL'C

     The computer beeps alerts as the aide tries to
     type commands.

  WRAITH
     What's wrong?

  WRAITH AIDE
     I cannot activate the portal. A lockout command
     has been initiated. It is preventing me from
     accessing the controls.

  WRAITH
     Override it.

  WRAITH AIDE
     I'm trying...it requires a code.

  ANNOTATION
     The lead Wraith turns to Kavanaugh, Lee, and
     Dempster.

  WRAITH
     What is the code?

  LEE
     (casually) We don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith stalks towards them.

  LEE
     Honestly, w-we don't know. There's only a handful
     of people who know that specific code for obvious
     security reasons, and uh...none of them are on the
     base right now, so...

  WRAITH
     You initiated the lockout?

  ANNOTATION
     Kavanaugh points to Lee.

  LEE
     Well, it's not really a matter of who initiated
     it. It's a standard protocol--

  WRAITH
     (insistent) Did you?

  LEE
     (stammering) Yeah. But...I mean, well, yeah, it
     was me, but...like I said, initiating it and
     overriding it are two entirely separate--

  WRAITH
     Silence!

  LEE
     ...things.

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith turns to his aide.

  WRAITH
     (impatient) Keep working. Find a way around it.

  WRAITH AIDE
     It will take time. The interface has several...

  WRAITH
     The more you speak, the less time you have.
     (turning to his prisoners) In the meantime,
     perhaps I can find a way to persuade you to give
     me that code.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee looks at the Wraith, terrified.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates.

  CARTER
     We've got a lock.

  SHEPPARD
     Finally.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, it seems someone was dialing out from 788,
     which was preventing us from dialing in until now.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon and Teal'c?

  MCKAY
     Oh, I doubt it. Look, even if the malfunction spat
     them out on the planet, the only logical address
     they would dial is back to Atlantis, which, as we
     know, they didn't.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, maybe it's them, and they can't get a lock?

  CARTER
     (into radio) Ronon, Teal'c, are you there? Ronon,
     Teal'c, this is Colonel Carter, please respond.

  MCKAY
     I'm telling you they made it to the Midway Station
     before the malfunction; I'm sure of it.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gives him a tense look.

  SHEPPARD
     Wait a minute. Didn't you say 788 is uninhabited?

  MCKAY
     It is.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, if it's not Ronon and Teal'c, then who
     dialed out?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gives him a blank look.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A technician steers a MALP through the Stargate.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Sheppard watch the MALP telemetry on
     the big monitor while McKay sits at a console.

  MCKAY
     The MALP is through. Receiving telemetry. Visual
     coming in now.

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows empty rocks and sand.

  MCKAY
     See? No Ronon, no Teal'c.

  CARTER
     Pan left.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay does so. The screen shows the Wraith
     tendrils and equipment by the DHD. Carter gasps.

  MCKAY
     (worried) That's Wraith tech. It's hooked up to
     the DHD!

  CARTER
     Pan right.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay does so, then tilts the camera up. The hive
     ship is now visible at the edge of the canyon.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, crap.

  ANNOTATION
     A Wraith soldier appears and shoots the camera
     with his stunner. The screen blackens with a menu
     alert saying "no signal."

  MCKAY
     We lost the feed.

  SHEPPARD
     Not to mention the MALP. Shut down the 'gate!

  CARTER
     Is it possible for them to have hijacked the
     Intergalactic Bridge?

  SHEPPARD
     This is a helluva lot more than a hiccup!

  MCKAY
     No, no, no. That' s impossible. In mean, first,
     they'd have to know about the bridge, and even if
     they did, there's too many security barriers in
     place. Look, the encryption I used on the
     call-forwarding macro would've them taken years to
     try to fig--

  SHEPPARD
     What if they knew the passwords?

  MCKAY
     How?

  SHEPPARD
     We just had a Wraith on base, Rodney, working with
     you, side by side, on your computers.

  MCKAY
     You mean Todd? He was our ally! Look, and even if
     he wanted to, there's no way he could hack into my
     system...could he?

  SHEPPARD
     You saw the tech hooked up to the DHD. What else
     could they be up to?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks disturbed.

  CARTER
     All right, listen, we have to get to Midway. The
     Daedalus is back on Earth. Is there another way we
     can get there?

  MCKAY
     Well, connect to the bridge via another 'gate in
     Pegasus.

  CARTER
     We have to find one that's close to the outer
     edge.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts typing while Carter stares at the
     schematic.

  MCKAY
     M6R-125. We could connect the bridge through that,
     but I'd need to reconfigure the macros.

  CARTER
     Okay. Get on it. Colonel, prepare a strike force.

  ANNOTATION
     She and Sheppard leave.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith drops Dempster's husk of corpse onto
     the floor after he's fed. Lee and Kavanaugh stare
     at the body of their colleague in horror. The
     Wraith stalks towards the pair.

  KAVANAUGH
     H-honestly, if I knew the code, I would have given
     it to you by now!

  WRAITH
     That depends on the strength of your allegiance.

  KAVANAUGH
     No, no, no, trust me! My allegiance is not that
     strong.

  LEE
     (agreeing) It really isn't.

  KAVANAUGH
     Please, please! I'm begging you!

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith raises his feeding hand; Kavanaugh
     collapses in a dead faint.

  LEE
     Yeah, um, I think...he fainted.

  WRAITH
     Then you shall be next.

  LEE
     Okay, wait...

  WRAITH AIDE
     I've got it. I've successfully gained access to
     override the lockout.

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith moves over to his aide.

  WRAITH
     Good. Dial the portal.

  ANNOTATION
     The aide complies. Lee rubs his face with his
     hand, worried.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon head down a corridor. They hear
     footsteps and see the shadows of approaching
     Wraith.

  TEAL'C

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c rush to a side corridor that
     holds space suits. They watch as the Wraith ascend
     the ladder.

  RONON
     They're heading to the Gate Room.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  RONON
     If you want to go to the control room, go ahead.
     I'm going after them.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon chases after the Wraith.

  TEAL'C

LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A large ball with arcing blue light rolls down the
     ramp. Everyone stares at it curiously in both the
     Gate room and the control room. It lets off an
     energy wave burst. Everyone in the gate room, the
     control room, and the corridors and rooms beyond
     throughout the facility are knocked out as the
     wave passes. The ball shuts down.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Carter have returned. Sheppard is in
     full off-world combat gear. McKay shows them a
     schematic.

  MCKAY
     All right, we're redirected. We gate from Atlantis
     to M6R-125. We insert this crystal with the bridge
     macros into the DHD, dial the first gate in the
     void, and we're back on track all the way to
     Midway.

  CARTER
     (to Sheppard) Is your strike force ready?

  SHEPPARD
     As soon as McKay gears up, we're ready to go.

  MCKAY
     Well, I'm-I'm uh... (sighing) All right, I-I'm
     gearing up.

     Ronon and Teal'c reach the antechamber and watch
     through the window as a group of soldiers march
     through the Milky Way Stargate.

  TEAL'C
     They have dialed the Milky Way 'gate.

  RONON
     They're headed for Stargate Command.

  TEAL'C
     We must pursue them.

  RONON
     (elbowing him) Now you're talking.

  ANNOTATION
     They try to reach the Gate Room and get into a
     firefight with Wraith soldiers converging on their
     positions.

  RONON
     Let's go before the gate shuts down!


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The lead Wraith watches as Teal'c and Ronon back
     their way up the ramp, firing at the Wraith
     soldiers.

  WRAITH
     Shut it down! Now!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c step through the Stargate just
     before it shuts down, leaving Wraith soldiers
     stranded on the ramp.

  WRAITH
     Two were able to pass through, but they will be
     dispensed of soon enough. Make ready the next--

  ANNOTATION
     The Pegasus Stargate activates an incoming
     wormhole.

  WRAITH TECH
     The Pegasus portal is activating.

  WRAITH
     (puzzled) The next inbound wave was supposed to
     wait for my command.

  ANNOTATION
     The tech types on the keyboard. The lead Wraith
     looks at the monitor. Sheppard's strike force team
     enters the station through the Stargate.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The strike force sweeps through the corridor.

  SHEPPARD

     One and Two, with me, this way.

  ANNOTATION
     The strike force splits up. McKay goes with
     Sheppard.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c enter the SGC through the
     Stargate, alert. They see the downed personnel and
     globe. Ronon checks one airman's vital signs as
     Teal'c approaches the globe.

  RONON
     Yeah, they're alive. They're just stunned.

  TEAL'C
     By this device perhaps.

  RONON
     I don't know. I've never seen one of these before.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks up to the control room and sees no
     one there conscious.

  TEAL'C
     It appears other personnel have been disabled as
     well. The question is how much of this base has
     been compromised?

  RONON
     Where the hell are the Wraith?


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team moves through the station. They
     encounter Wraith and engage in a firefight.

  SHEPPARD

     in! Ronon, do you copy!


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith watches the firefight as teams spread
     through the station.

  WRAITH

  ANNOTATION
     The technician presses some controls, and the
     blast door shuts.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith shooting at Sheppard have either
     retreated or been killed. Sheppard waves his team
     ahead.

  SHEPPARD
     Clear.

  ANNOTATION
     He leads them down the corridor. A monitor on the
     wall comes to life, and the head Wraith shows up
     on the screen.

  WRAITH
     (on video) Colonel Sheppard!

  MCKAY
     Sheppard!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard stare at the screen.

  WRAITH
     You have no chance of retaking this station.
     Therefore, it is in your best interest to
     surrender immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange puzzled looks.

  SHEPPARD
     Do I know you?

  WRAITH
     Not personally, no. But I know a great deal about
     you. You as well, Doctor McKay.

  MCKAY
     Who are you?


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between the control room
     and corridor, where McKay and Sheppard appear on
     the control room's vid screen.

  WRAITH
     An acquaintance of someone you recently worked
     with to bring about the demise of those you
     referred to as "Replicators." It was from him that
     I was able to procure the necessary data to
     commandeer this base.

  MCKAY
     (furious, to Sheppard) It was Todd! That bastard
     hacked my system!

  SHEPPARD
     So much for buddies. (to Wraith) So, what's the
     plan? Take over Midway, and then what? Earth?

  WRAITH
     My warriors are securing a beachhead in your
     command center as we speak.

  SHEPPARD
     Hate to break this to you, but the SGC is heavily
     fortified. You're walking into a world of hurt.

  WRAITH
     Not to worry. We have ways of evening the odds.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon investigate the control room,
     finding everyone unconscious and the monitors
     showing a lockdown. Ronon spots Wraith moving on a
     surveillance monitor.

  RONON
     Look they're working their to the surface, tryin'
     to get out.

  TEAL'C
     (confidently) They will be unable to do so. A
     pulse of energy--no doubt from that Wraith
     device--has triggered the SGC automatic lockdown.

  RONON
     So, no one gets in, and no one gets out?

  TEAL'C
     (smiling) Indeed.

  RONON
     That's just the way I like it.

  ANNOTATION
     They move out.

     (sotto voce) Oh, crap.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard hits him.

  SHEPPARD

     but...gotta go.

  ANNOTATION
     He shoots the camera with his pistol.

     (to two strike force members) You two, with me.

  ANNOTATION
     He, McKay and some strike force members run down
     the corridor.

  MCKAY
     Where're we going?

  SHEPPARD
     We're going to the control room, to shut down the
     'gate!


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's group gets into a firefight with the
     two Wraith soldiers guarding the door. Both guards
     are downed, but not before one stuns one of the
     strike force team. The door opens and other
     soldiers fire, but are gunned down by Sheppard.
     Another strike force team member is stunned. The
     Wraith technician goes for one of the soldier's
     guns, but is shot by Sheppard before he can reach
     it.

     Sheppard lowers his gun.

  SHEPPARD

  LEE
     He left.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I can see that. Where'd he go?

  LEE
     Uh, I-I don't know. He just ran out.

  SHEPPARD
     (calling out) McKay, we're in the clear! Get to
     work!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay comes up from the corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     Where's Ronon and Teal'c?

  LEE
     They went through the Milky Way Gate on the way to
     Stargate Command. They were chasing after the
     Wraith.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, here.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands Lee his pistol. McKay types on the
     console.

  LEE
     What am I supposed to--

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard points generally to the downed strike
     force members.

  SHEPPARD
     Get those two guys inside. Seal the door. Shoot
     anything that tries to get through.

  MCKAY
     Where are you going?

  SHEPPARD
     Going to help those marines.

  ANNOTATION
     He spots Kavanaugh lying on the floor.

  SHEPPARD
     Is he dead?

  LEE
     Fainted.

  SHEPPARD
     (sneering) Figures.

  MCKAY
     Well, you better wake him up. We got a problem.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     I can't shut down the Stargate.

  LEE
     I think I saw them inputting a lockout protocol
     just before you guys came in.

  MCKAY
     Damn it!

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor for the Gate room shows another wave
     of Wraith soldiers entering the station through
     the Stargate.

  SHEPPARD
     We got Wraith coming through the 'gate. We're

     The radio speaker is filled with static and
     gunfire.

  HESTER
     (over radio) We're still outside of the gate room.
     We got a ton of Wraith coming through.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Where are the other teams?

  HESTER
     (over radio) I lost contact with them. I don't
     know how much longer we can hold them off here,
     sir!

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Just hang on. McKay's trying to shut
     down the 'gate.

  ANNOTATION
     The speaker sounds the hail of gunfire, and
     Hester's team shouting and screaming.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Hester? Hester! Come in!

  ANNOTATION
     The reception becomes interrupted. After a final
     scream, all is silent.

     Sheppard turns a corner and encounters Wraith. He
     shoots several of them down before falling back.
     The remaining Wraith pursue him.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c wander the corridors, noticing
     the unconscious personnel scattered everywhere.
     They pause by a desiccated corpse. Teal'c bends
     down to study it.

  RONON
     He was fed on by the Wraith. It's not a good way
     to go.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes the airman's zat.

  RONON
     You say that a lot.

  TEAL'C
     What?

  RONON
     "Indeed."

  TEAL'C
     (concerned) Do I?

  RONON
     Yeah.

  TEAL'C
     (considering) I had not noticed.

  ANNOTATION
     They move to another corridor. As Ronon turns the
     corner, he sees a Wraith soldier feeding.

  RONON
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     He shoots the Wraith soldier and rushes forward in
     bloodlust. Teal'c moves back more cautiously.

  TEAL'C
     Ronon!

  ANNOTATION
     Two more Wraith come after Ronon from another side
     corridor. One pins Ronon against the wall, while
     Teal'c zats the other. More Wraith come up behind
     Teal'c and he fires at them. Another one tries to
     tackle Teal'c from the side corridor, but he spins
     and knocks it against the wall.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon continues to wrestle the Wraith pinning him,
     trying to keep his feeding arm away. Teal'c breaks
     the neck of the Wraith he fights. Ronon is losing
     his struggle against the Wraith choking him.
     Teal'c shoots it with Ronon's lost pistol, then
     studies the weapon in his hand while Ronon coughs
     and catches his breath. Teal'c offers the pistol
     back to Ronon, butt first.

  TEAL'C
     I would very much like to have a weapon such as
     this.

     The rest of the conversation switches between here
     and Sheppard's location.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Still working.

  SHEPPARD
     (low, over radio) I've lost contact with Hester
     and the marines. I think they were killed. How
     long before you get the 'gate shut down?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. This is extremely complicated.

  KAVANAUGH
     Have you tried the critical systems bypass?

  MCKAY
     I have to figure out a safe work-around to avoid
     any commands that may have been compromised.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard runs down a corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     You better hurry up! We got more Wraith on the
     way.

  MCKAY
     (irked) I'm working as fast as I can!

  KAVANAUGH
     (to Lee) Why doesn't he just bypass the critical
     systems?

  LEE
     (dismissive) N-not now. Just watch the door.

  ANNOTATION
     While McKay talks through the radio, Kavanaugh
     purses his lips and walks determinedly to a wall
     panel, typing some commands.

  MCKAY
     Besides, even if I could shut down the 'gate,
     there's Wraith in every sector of the base. We're
     completely outnumbered. I mean, it's just a matter
     of time before they wipe us all--

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate shuts down.

  MCKAY
     The 'gate just shut off.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Lee stare at their displays, surprised
     and worried. McKay turns to Kavanaugh.

  MCKAY
     What did you do?

  KAVANAUGH
     I shut it off using the critical systems bypass.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Lee look at Kavanaugh in horror.

  MCKAY

  KAVANAUGH
     What? It worked!

  ANNOTATION
     The self-destruct alarm starts to blare.

  LEE
     (terrified) Oh my God. The self destruct.

  KAVANAUGH
     I didn't mean--I...I--

  MCKAY
     Did you not just hear me say I need to figure out
     a safe workaround to avoid any commands that may
     have been compromised? As in booby-trapped? Look,
     I didn't use the bypass to shut down the 'gate for
     this very reason!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard climbs down a ladder into another
     corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     We've made a terrible mistake! We never should've
     revived Kavanaugh!

  SHEPPARD
     (horrified) He triggered the self-destruct?

  KAVANAUGH
     Not on purpose!

  MCKAY
     (tightly) That doesn't really matter now, does it?

  LEE
     (checking his watch, fighting to stay calm) All
     right, we've got just under ten minutes before
     this whole station blows up.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, can you turn it off?

  MCKAY
     No. We're completely locked out. The Wraith made
     sure if they couldn't have this station, then no
     one could.

  LEE
     (shuddering breath) Oh, things couldn't get any
     worse.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear blasts just outside.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Wraith soldiers shoot at the door.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  KAVANAUGH
     They're shooting at the door.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon search the corridor. They hear a
     noise in one room. They move to it and burst
     inside.


LOCATION--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c find IOA members slumped
     unconscious in a secondary conference room.

  TEAL'C
     Wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves over. Coolidge has fallen out of his
     chair, but the movement has awakened him (or vice
     versa). He struggles to his feet.

  TEAL'C
     Are you all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Coolidge blinks at Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     Ronon Dex, this is Mr. Coolidge of the IOA.

  RONON
     Oh. Hey.

  COOLIDGE
     What happened?

  TEAL'C
     You were rendered unconscious by a Wraith stun
     device.

  COOLIDGE
     What? There are Wraith? Here?

  TEAL'C
     They have infiltrated the base. It is best if you
     remain in this room until Ronon Dex and I have
     neutralized the situation.

  COOLIDGE
     No, no, no. We need to get to the control room,
     radio for help.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon puts his hand out and steps in Coolidge's
     path.

  RONON
     We don't need help.

  COOLIDGE
     How many Wraith are here on this base?

  TEAL'C
     We do not know exact numbers, but there are many.

  COOLIDGE
     And who else beside you are going after them?

  TEAL'C
     We are the only two.

  COOLIDGE
     Get me to a radio!

  RONON
     It's better if we--

  COOLIDGE
     Now!


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard hides in a room as soldiers storm through
     the corridor outside.

  SHEPPARD
     I've got an idea, Rodney.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between the two
     locations.

  MCKAY
     Great, because we've got Wraith just about to
     blast through the door.

  SHEPPARD
     This place has got a puddle jumper docked here,
     right?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, to be used as an emergency escape pod.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard reloads his rifle.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I'd say this pretty much qualifies...as an
     emergency.

  LEE
     (stammering) No, no, no, no! We'll be stuck out
     here in the middle of the galactic void!

  MCKAY
     They'll mount a rescue. It might take a couple of
     weeks, but the jumper is stocked with food and
     water. We should be all right, unless you want to
     stay here and get blown to smithereens with the
     rest of the station. Your call!

  KAVANAUGH
     We've got one other problem. How we going to get
     there?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee and McKay look stumped...and worried.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rounds a corner, timing it right to shoot
     and kill several Wraith. He runs and finds the
     strike force, all dead and fed upon.

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney, we're out of time. Vent the atmosphere.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between here and
     Sheppard's location.

  MCKAY
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Every room but the control room. Vent the air.

  MCKAY
     How close are you?

  SHEPPARD
     Don't wait for me, just do it.

  MCKAY
     Can you make it to the jumper?

  SHEPPARD
     I don't know. I'll try.

  ANNOTATION
     He breaks into a run.

  ANNOTATION
     In the control room, Lee and McKay look horrified.

  MCKAY
     John, I'm not sure there's time to--

  SHEPPARD
     (sharply) We don't have time to argue! Do it!

  ANNOTATION
     The blasting continues to sound outside the door
     of the control room, becoming even more intense.
     Lee licks his lips nervously and taps Rodney on
     the shoulder in encouragement.

  MCKAY
     Venting the atmosphere.

  ANNOTATION
     He types controls to vent the oxygen.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     The air is sucked out of the station. The Wraith
     soldiers struggle, but quickly lose their breath
     and fall. In one corridor, Sheppard struggles from
     the wind caused by the air being blown out, trying
     to reach the jumper. He is tackled by the head
     Wraith. They struggle; Sheppard is able shoot the
     Wraith with his pistol. Sheppard moves only a
     small way across the floor before running out of
     breath and stopping, face down.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teal'c shoot several Wraith trying to
     open the elevator doors to the shaft. Coolidge
     follows, keeping his head ducked from bullet
     casings. He ducks for cover as the firefight
     ensues, finally running away. Finally all the
     Wraith are downed by Ronon and Teal'c.

  RONON
     (gesturing two directions from the corridor) I'll
     go this way, you go that way.

  TEAL'C
     Where is Mr. Coolidge?

  RONON
     (glancing around) I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     They split up.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Kavanaugh listens at the door. The self-destruct
     continues to count down. Lee looks at the
     surveillance monitors.

  KAVANAUGH
     It's pretty quiet out there.

  LEE
     (looking at the security camera display) Looks
     like they're all dead.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Sheppard, can you hear me?...John,
     are you there?

  ANNOTATION
     The two stunned marines finally awaken. Kavanaugh
     helps them to their feet. McKay keeps listening
     for Sheppard to respond.

  LEE
     (quietly) It should be enough time. I think it's
     safe to re-pressurize...Doctor McKay?

  MCKAY
     (shakily) Yeah...re-pressurizing the station.

  ANNOTATION
     He types some controls, his face a mask of grief.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon runs in. He finds Coolidge standing by a
     control panel.

  RONON
     What are you doing?

  COOLIDGE
     I've contacted the military. They're fully aware
     of the situation, which means, unfortunately,
     they're preparing to nuke the base.

  RONON
     What?!

  ANNOTATION
     Some of the control room personnel are beginning
     to awaken; they get up groggily.

  COOLIDGE
     Stargate Command has been compromised! The only
     way to fully prevent the Wraith from infiltrating
     the general population is to destroy it.

  RONON
     (fiercely) Well, tell them to call it off.

  COOLIDGE
     I can't do that. Not as long as there's a single
     Wraith is still alive on this base!

  HARRIMAN
     Wraith?! What, here?

  RONON
     Listen, we'll deal with the Wraith. Look, you've
     still got people alive here. Buy us some more
     time!

  COOLIDGE
     We don't have time. Look, there's an escape hatch
     to the surface. We need to get to it immediately.
     Where's Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon glances at the security monitors. Teal'c is
     trapped in a corridor, Wraith shooting at him from
     both sides.

  RONON
     He's surrounded. I need to get back to him.

  COOLIDGE
     No. No time! We have to leave as soon as we can!

  RONON
     Not without Teal'c.

  COOLIDGE
     We can't go back for him! We could get bogged down
     or killed!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon leaves. Coolidge follows calling after him.

  COOLIDGE
     Now, there's a clear path to the escape hatch, and
     we need to get out of here, now!

  RONON
     (spinning, furious) You want to run away and save
     yourself? Fine! I'm staying here.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes off.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Kavanaugh, Lee and the two marines climb
     down a ladder to the corridor near the jumper.

  MCKAY
     The jumper bay is...

  LEE
     Through the EVA prep room. And it's not a real bay
     though. It's more like an airlock that leads to a
     hatch that's cut into the top--

  MCKAY
     (impatient) I don't need the blueprints! Where is
     it?

  ANNOTATION
     Kavanaugh points. Lee points too, with his pistol.

  LEE
     It's over there...

  MCKAY
     Just...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay lowers Lee's gun arm and cuts ahead, anxious
     to look for Sheppard.


LOCATION--MIDWAY STATION EVA PREP ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The door to the room opens. McKay motions for Lee
     to come forward. He moves to a large hatchway
     door.

  LEE
     Through here.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee enters the combination to the airlock on the
     electronic keypad. Kavanaugh pushes Lee aside to
     be the first one through. Resigned, Lee follows,
     followed by the two marines. McKay is the last to
     go, but pauses upon hearing one of the EVA suit's
     regulators hissing. He approaches and turns on the
     active suit's helmet light. Sheppard is
     semi-conscious inside.

  MCKAY
     (shocked) Sheppard?! How the hell did you--?

  SHEPPARD
     (weakly) Get me out of here.

  MCKAY
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts to unlock his helmet.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c guns down two Wraith, turns and shoots a
     third, trying to move through. He guns down
     another Wraith, then pauses, sensing for the next
     attack. A Wraith comes out of one of the closed
     doors and tackles him from the side. Ronon shoots
     two other Wraith trying to ambush Teal'c, but gets
     distracted by a Wraith behind him.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ronon both deal hand-to-hand with
     individual Wraith. Teal'c is caught off-guard by
     his enemy and thrown across the hallway into the
     section wall. He collapses. Ronon is able to get
     away from his guard and grabs a section of pipe
     from the ceiling. Wielding it like a bantos stick,
     he clubs the Wraith.

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith soldier pins Teal'c against the wall
     and feeds on him for a moment. He screams in pain.
     The Wraith is impaled by Ronon's broken section of
     pipe. He falls to the floor dead as Ronon stands
     behind him. Teal'c catches his breath and wipes
     his bloody lip.

  TEAL'C
     (weakly) Excellent timing.

  RONON
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods in gratitude and slowly moves forward.
     Ronon claps him on the back.

  RONON
     Well, I think that's all of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks around.

  TEAL'C
     (hoarsely) I certainly hope you are correct.

  RONON
     We got to call the military. They're going to blow
     this place up.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Lee looks worriedly at the ceiling airlock.

  LEE
     What's taking him so long?

  KAVANAUGH
     (checking watch) The self-destruct's about to
     blow! Twenty seconds!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay drops into the jumper, followed immediately
     by Sheppard.

  KAVANAUGH
     Colonel Sheppard! How did you...?

  SHEPPARD
     (impatient) Later! We're leaving. Sit down!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard joins McKay in the cockpit.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper powers up and flies away seconds before
     the station explodes.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The IOA committee sit together at one side of the
     table. Ronon sits facing them.

  COOLIDGE
     Ronon Dex...do you feel that you can fulfill the
     duties of an SG team member with diligence,
     integrity, and respect for those in authority over
     you?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon slowly leans close to the microphone in
     front of him.

  RONON
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon leans back. Coolidge looks to his fellow
     committee members.

  COOLIDGE
     (smiling) Good enough for me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon looks at them, surprised, then turns in his
     chair.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c waits outside the door for Ronon to exit.
     Ronon opens the door and walks out, closing the
     door behind them.

  TEAL'C
     Well?

  RONON
     I'm exactly the kind of team member they want out
     there fighting the Wraith. Their words, not mine.

  TEAL'C
     And you did not hold a weapon to their heads?

  RONON
     I did not.

  TEAL'C
     (smiling) I am pleased.

  RONON
     (smiling, shrugging) Yeah, well, I had a good
     coach.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. The Daedalus is preparing to leave.
     Colonel Caldwell will beam you aboard when you are
     ready.

  RONON
     (concerned) Still nothing from Midway?

  TEAL'C
     No. We have lost all contact with them. The
     Daedalus will stop on its way back to Atlantis to
     assess the situation.

  ANNOTATION
     As they walk, Ronon appears worried.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper floats in the void between the
     Milky Way Galaxy and Pegasus Galaxy.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Kavanaugh and Lee hold playing cards and sit on
     the floor of the jumper. The marines sit on the
     benches and McKay sits on the floor--the trio look
     bored.

  LEE
     No way. You actually liked it?

  KAVANAUGH
     It's his finest film.

  LEE
     Pearl Harbor?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee turns to the others for support, looking
     incredulous.

  KAVANAUGH
     Yeah, go ahead and mock it, everybody does. But
     that film will endure. It's got weight.

  LEE
     Yeah, which is why it plummeted at the box office!

  KAVANAUGH
     Two hundred million dollars domestic? That's not
     plummeting, I beg to differ.

  MCKAY
     (fuming, talking over Kavanaugh) Enough already!
     We've been stuck here for god knows how long, and
     you haven't shut up, either of you! You just keep
     talking and tal-tal-talk-talk-talk-talk!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay natters into silence, his arms expressing
     his frustration. There is a loud metallic clank
     outside.

  MCKAY
     What was that?

  LEE
     Something just hit us.

  ANNOTATION
     The door starts to open and they struggle to their
     feet.

  KAVANAUGH
     Oh!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon stands outside in the Daedalus hangar bay
     with two Daedalus crew members.

  MCKAY
     Ronon!

  LEE
     Wha-where are we?

  RONON
     Daedalus, 302 bay. We saw you, scooped you up.
     We're heading back to Atlantis.

  KAVANAUGH
     Thank God.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to hug Ronon, but Ronon pushes him against
     the jumper bulkhead. Lee slaps Ronon on the back.
     Ronon walks up to McKay as the marines leave.

  MCKAY
     (sadly) Midway was destroyed.

  RONON
     Yeah, we saw. Where's Sheppard?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay opens the door to the pilot cabin. Sheppard
     lounges asleep in the pilot chair, facing the rear
     compartment with headphones over his ears.

  MCKAY
     Lasted about a day, sealed himself in there.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay rolls his eyes and leaves.

  RONON
     No wonder he didn't hear the radio call.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon approaches Sheppard and taps him on the
     cheek. Sheppard, still asleep, bats Ronon's hand
     away. Ronon smiles and tweaks Sheppard's nose.
     Sheppard bats him again. Fighting laughter, Ronon
     tries again. Sheppard starts awake.

  SHEPPARD
     Mwhah!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon laughs.

  SHEPPARD
     Thank God! (pointing to rear compartment) I almost
     shot myself with a stunner.

  RONON
     Yeah. I understand.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard groans, taking off his headphones and
     looking out the window.

  SHEPPARD
     Where are we?

  RONON
     Daedalus 302 bay.

  SHEPPARD
     What's the status of SGC?

  RONON
     Secure. Teal'c and I took care of the Wraith.

  SHEPPARD
     I figured you would.

  RONON
     (beckoning) Come on. Let's get the hell out of
     here.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon starts walking out. Sheppard follows,
     picking up his vest as he leaves.

  RONON
     Oh, and I, uh, passed my interview with the IOA.

  SHEPPARD
     Really?

  RONON
     Yeah. They said they liked me.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, what's not to like?
