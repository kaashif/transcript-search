<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>TEYLA: Exactly as you said it would. The new member of the IOA, Mister Coolidge? Was somewhat brusque and arrogant. He insisted on doing most of the questioning himself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>CARTER: Yeah, I thought he would. These interviews were the first item on his agenda.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: Don't worry, just a new guy marking his territory.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>TEYLA: Yes. They knew. And most of the members were actually quite supportive. But Mr. Coolidge...his demeanor toward women differs from his demeanor toward men. He kept calling me "honey."</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>TEYLA: In the end, I don't think he'll have a problem with me, mainly because I think he believes I will not be returning to active duty after my child is born.</td></tr>
