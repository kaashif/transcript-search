     Ford and his team are on a balcony, flanked by two
     groups of Wraith.

  FORD
     Defense!

  ANNOTATION
     Firefight between Ford's team and Wraith. Most on
     both sides are killed or rendered unconscious. A
     Wraith soldier drone disarms Ford, takes him by
     the throat and starts to feed on him. Meanwhile,
     an injured Marine removes the pin from a grenade
     and drops it on the floor behind the Wraith
     feeding on Ford, where it explodes. Ford and the
     Wraith are blown off the balcony and fall into the
     ocean below.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     The Puddle Jumper, piloted by Colonel Sheppard,
     approaches the dart bay entrance to a Wraith hive
     ship.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) Major Sheppard, de-cloak your jumper
     immediately.

  SHEPPARD
     (confused) What? Who the hell is this?

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) Authentication Alpha-Charlie-One.
     De-cloak now.

     Puddle Jumper de-cloaks as it enters hive ship
     dart bay entrance.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Beckett are watching monitors anxiously
     as McKay reports.

  MCKAY
     Detonation in five, four, three, two...

  ANNOTATION
     Monitor shows positions of Wraith ships above the
     planet as red dots, with a blue dot representing
     the Puddle Jumper approaching a hive.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Dozens of Wraith darts fly over the city, firing
     on it. There is a bright flash through the clouds.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Monitor shows the bright flash of an explosion
     where one of the Wraith ships was positioned, then
     it disappears along with the blue dot representing
     the Puddle Jumper. McKay, Beckett and Weir are
     anxiously watching the screen.

  CHUCK
     Target has been neutralized.

  WEIR
     He did it.

  MCKAY
     (sadly) Yeah. He did it.

  CHUCK
     Dr. Weir, I'm picking up another ship.

  WEIR
     Another hive ship?

  CHUCK
     Negative. I'm reading I.F.F.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Atlantis, this is Sheppard.

  WEIR
     (with disbelief) John?

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) What other Sheppards do you know?

  BECKETT
     (smiling broadly and punching McKay on the
     shoulder) Oh, thank God.

  MCKAY
     (incredulous) No, it can't be. We saw the hive
     ship go up.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) I assure you, Dr. McKay, that Major
     Sheppard is alive and well.

  WEIR
     Who is this?


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell takes his seat on the bridge, flanked by
     his Bridge Officer, Kleinman and pilot, Cooper.

  CALDWELL
     Colonel Steven Caldwell, commander of the
     Daedalus. We are ready to assist you.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (with relief) Oh, thank you.

  WEIR
     Well, we are very glad to hear it, Colonel. And I
     assume we have you to thank for saving Major
     Sheppard.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     We were monitoring your transmissions as soon as
     we came out of hyperspace, but we couldn't beam
     him in until he de-cloaked his jumper.

  SHEPPARD
     Didn't take much convincing.

  CALDWELL
     Dr. McKay?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (jumping to his feet with surprise) Present. Yes.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) I trust you'll know what to do with
     this.

  ANNOTATION
     Two Marines carrying a metal box are beamed into
     the control room.

  MARINE #1
     Your ZPM, Sir.

  BECKETT
     (shocked) How did they do that?

  MCKAY
     (excitedly taking the box from the Marine) The
     Daedalus is loaded with Asgard technology. The
     beaming technology's the first part of it. They've
     got...

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Rodney...


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     What say we get the shields back up?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (smiling as he takes the ZPM from the box) What
     say we.

  WEIR
     We still have Wraith all over the city.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     After we deal with this other hive ship, we'll
     assist you as soon as we can. Caldwell out.

  KLEINMAN
     Sir, we have incoming enemy fighters bearing
     three-two-zero.

  CALDWELL
     All forward rail guns stand by. Launch all
     fighters.

LOCATION--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Colonel Everett is struggling with a Wraith, he
     fires at it but runs out of bullets. The Wraith
     begins to feed on Everett, then an injured Marine
     fires at it.

  ANNOTATION
     Firefight between Daedalus and Wraith ships
     continues.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  NOVAK
     (over radio) Colonel Caldwell? This is Novak in
     Engineering.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) What is it?

  NOVAK
     Hermiod wanted to remind you that our shield
     strength will be severely diminished without the
     Zero Point Module tied into our power systems.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) I'm well aware of that, Doctor.
     Caldwell out.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is standing at the window of the bridge,
     where Caldwell joins him. The battle can be seen
     going on outside the ship.

  CALDWELL
     Major, do you recommend any specific target on the
     hive ship?

  SHEPPARD
     One of the fighter bays, Sir.

  CALDWELL
     It would increase the chance of secondary
     explosions.

  SHEPPARD
     That was the thinking, Sir.

  CALDWELL
     I agree. (to Kleinman) Weapons, arm two Mark VIII
     tacticals. Our target is the hive ship's main
     fighter bay.

  KLEINMAN
     Warheads armed. Target is locked, Sir.

  CALDWELL
     Fire.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS, SPACE BATTLE

  ANNOTATION
     Missiles are launched but are intercepted by
     darts.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (frustrated) They didn't even get close.

  CALDWELL
     Pilot, alter heading to intercept. Go to max
     thrust.

  COOPER
     Max thrust.

  CALDWELL
     We'll just have to get closer.

  SHEPPARD
     (quizzically) The Asgard gave you hyperdrives and
     shields. How come no offensive weapons?

  CALDWELL
     They don't like providing other races with
     anything that could potentially be used against
     them.

  SHEPPARD
     I thought they were allies.

  CALDWELL
     Without their beaming technology, you wouldn't be
     here, Major. (to Kleinman) Arm two more Mark
     VIIIs.

  SHEPPARD
     You're wasting ordnance, Colonel. Those missiles
     are being intercepted miles from the hive ship.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka runs down the stairs into the control
     room, where he joins McKay who is punching keys on
     the computer.

  MCKAY
     I brought up the shield subroutine. When I give
     the word, all you have to do is punch in...

  ZELENKA
     (impatiently) Yes, I know what to do. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay takes the metal box containing the ZPM and
     joins Weir and two Marines outside the control
     room.

  MCKAY
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? This
     is my security escort?

  WEIR
     Well, we are spread a little bit thin right now.

  MCKAY
     (to Marines) Okay, well, you need to know that if
     we come under fire, you'll have to put your lives
     on the line to protect me.

  WEIR
     Rodney!

  MCKAY
     Okay, I mean, the ZPM. You need to protect the ZPM
     at all costs... and me. (to Weir) Am I wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and the Marines leave the gate room.

  CHUCK
     Dr. Weir?

  WEIR
     Yes?

  CHUCK
     I've lost contact with some of our people.

  WEIR
     Who?

  CHUCK
     I can't get a hold of the teams led by Captain
     Radner, Teyla, or Lieutenant Ford.

  WEIR
     Well, keep trying.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir walks away as Chuck returns to his console,
     exchanging a sympathetic glance with Zelenka and
     Beckett.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows numerous Wraith ships bearing
     down on the Daedalus.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, now we're oh-for-two. How many of these
     things have you got?

  CALDWELL
     Only one needs to get through.

  SHEPPARD
     Is there any way we can deliver a warhead the same
     way you plucked me out of the Jumper?

  CALDWELL
     The Asgard have already considered that, Major.
     There are fail-safes built into the system to
     prevent their use as a weapons delivery system.

  SHEPPARD
     You've got one of these Asgard on board. Can he
     override the fail-safe?

  CALDWELL
     Why would he do that?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, his butt's on the line just as much as ours.

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Novak, I need you and Hermiod to
     figure out how to get a site-to-site transport
     lock on a set of coordinates inside the hive ship.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  NOVAK
     (nervously) No, no, no, no, no, no. Sir, uh,
     Hermiod isn't going to like that.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) Get it done, Doctor. That's an order.

  ANNOTATION
     Hermiod looks quizzically at Novak, who appears
     anxious.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and two Marines are stealthily making their
     way through darkened corridors. They stop when
     they see two Wraith soldier drones at a control
     panel ahead.

  MCKAY
     That's where we have to go.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the Marines gives a series of hand signals
     to the other as the three men take positions.

  MCKAY
     What's that? I didn't get all that. What do I do?
     Look, I'm getting good at the roll-y things. Maybe
     I can...

  ANNOTATION
     The Marines move out, attracting the attention of
     the Wraith, who come to investigate. They are
     ambushed and shot.

  MARINE
     (to the other Marine) Clear. (to McKay as he tries
     to go with them) No. You stay here.

  MCKAY
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Both Marines are shot by a Wraith soldier drone,
     who then aims his weapon at McKay. McKay puts down
     the box containing the ZPM and looks defiantly at
     the Wraith.

  MCKAY
     So...this is how it's going to be, huh? Just me?

  ANNOTATION
     Another Wraith enters and aims its weapon at
     McKay.

  MCKAY
     Okay, that's fine! (drawing his sidearm) You want
     some of this? Huh? Huh?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay attempts to fire at the Wraith but the clip
     falls out of the gun.

  MCKAY
     (calling out frantically) This is McKay! I'm in
     trouble down here!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay ducks out of the way as automatic weapons
     fire is heard. Teyla enters, having shot the two
     Wraith.

  TEYLA
     Dr. McKay? Are you all right?

  MCKAY
     Teyla! We thought you were...

  TEYLA
     My radio is broken and I was separated from my
     group. I have been trying to make my way back.

  MCKAY
     Well, thank God. I mean, you have no idea. I
     thought I was going to...

  TEYLA
     I thought you were very brave.

  MCKAY
     (surprised) Really? Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla looks questioningly at the metal box.

  MCKAY
     I have a ZPM.

  TEYLA
     Yes.

  MCKAY
     Because we need to get the shields up.

  TEYLA
     Lead the way.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, sure. Uh, after you.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     Monitor screen shows a detonation sequence.

  NOVAK
     I've set the timer for five seconds. Is that
     enough time for you?

  HERMIOD
     Five seconds should be more than ample.

  NOVAK
     Okay, look... I know you don't approve of using
     technology this way, but you have to understand...

  HERMIOD
     (firmly) I am ready.

  NOVAK
     (into radio) Colonel, Hermiod is ready and
     standing by for warhead transport, but I can tell
     you he is not happy about this.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) I'll take that under advisement. (to
     Kleinman) Are we within transport range?

  KLEINMAN
     Yes, Sir.

  CALDWELL
     Transport warhead when ready.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  NOVAK
     Ready. Five...

  ANNOTATION
     beeping

  NOVAK
     The weapon is away.

  ANNOTATION
     Hermiod mutters unintelligibly.


LOCATION--HIVE SHIP IN SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The hive explodes in a massive fireball.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Monitor shows the explosion.

  CHUCK
     (grinning) We have a kill. The last hive ship has
     been neutralized.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Zelenka smile at each other with relief.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Novak, I need you to prep another
     warhead for transport. We need to take out those
     cruisers.

  SHEPPARD
     Sir, wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Through the window behind Sheppard we see Wraith
     ships disappearing.

  KLEINMAN
     Colonel, cruisers have broken off and entered
     hyperspace.

  CALDWELL
     After seeing what we just did to their remaining
     hive ships, I don't blame them.

  SHEPPARD
     There's still a lot of darts out there.

  CALDWELL
     All right, let's clean this up.

  KLEINMAN
     Sir, the Wraith fighters are regrouping.

  CALDWELL
     All rail gun positions stand by for defensive
     fire.

  SHEPPARD
     We're not the target.

  KLEINMAN
     Major Sheppard is right, Sir. The formation is
     headed toward Atlantis.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Elizabeth, you've got a problem.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows a large group of red dots moving
     towards the city.

  WEIR
     Yeah, we see that, Major.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) We're moving to intercept but I don't
     think we can get there in time.

  CHUCK
     Not a chance. They're coming in too fast.

  ZELENKA
     (horrified) Oh, my God. Their approach is
     ballistic.

  WEIR
     And what exactly does that mean?

  ZELENKA
     Their impact velocities will be in excess of
     10,000 kilometers an hour. No part of the city can
     withstand that.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     You better get the damn shield up.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     How much time do we have?

  ZELENKA
     Forty-five seconds.

  WEIR
     (into radio, anxiously) Rodney, we need the shield
     up in forty seconds or we're dead.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY

  MCKAY
     (into radio) What, are you kidding me?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir is at the balcony door, which slides open to
     reveal the cloudy sky from which the darts will
     descend on the city.

  WEIR
     (into radio) No.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Because I can't help but think you're
     just trying to determine the point at which I
     completely snap.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     (into radio) Rodney!


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla watches as McKay positions the ZPM in its
     holder, it illuminates and he runs to a control
     panel.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) That should do it. Fire it up.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka shakes his head at Weir. The monitor shows
     the red dots advancing on the city.

  WEIR
     (into radio) That didn't do it.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY

  MCKAY
     (into radio) What?

  TEYLA
     It is not working.

  MCKAY
     I know what she said.

  WEIR
     (over radio) Twenty seconds.

  MCKAY
     (into radio, waving his finger angrily) Okay.
     Snap! That's it! You all happy now?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     (into radio) Rodney!


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay pushes down on the ZPM and it begins to fall
     slowly into its holder.

  MCKAY
     (into radio while waiting for the ZPM to fall
     fully into place) Okay, okay, okaaay. Try it now!


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ZELENKA
     (relieved) Yes.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM BALCONY, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Weir watches as the shield rises over the city.
     The Wraith darts descend from the clouds and crash
     into it, exploding on impact.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Atlantis, this is Sheppard. Come in.
     Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Caldwell exchange a look of concern.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka and Weir are watching the explosions above
     the city.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio, broken by static) Elizabeth...I
     repeat...this is Sheppard. What is your status?

  ZELENKA
     The explosions must have disrupted the radio
     signals.

  WEIR
     (into radio) We're still here. That's our status.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (relieved, into radio) Don't scare me like that.

  WEIR
     (over radio) Sorry. What about the Wraith fleet?

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) The remaining cruisers have withdrawn
     from the battle.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     (into radio) Thank you, Colonel. Thank all of you.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     (into radio) Glad to be of help. We're going to
     stay in geosynchronous orbit for the time being.
     Can we be of any further assistance?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     (into radio) We could use some help with the
     Wraith in the city.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) I'll send some people to help with
     that. Daedalus out.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     Major Sheppard, I'm sure you're anxious to get
     back to Atlantis.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir. Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leaves the bridge.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY

  WEIR
     (over radio) Rodney, you can take the rest of the
     day off.

  MCKAY
     (lying down on floor) Oh... I'm going to curl up
     in bed with the largest sandwich I can find.

  TEYLA
     (leaning over him, snarkily) Shall I just explain
     to the rest of the Wraith left on the base that
     you are unavailable to fight?

  MCKAY
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla helps McKay get up and they enter the city.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and four Marines beam into the gate room.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Marines as they move out) Secure Stargate
     Operations. (calls out) Well, I'm home.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir walks over to Sheppard, smiling, and hugs
     him. He returns the hug, uncomfortably.

  WEIR
     Yes, you are. I truly thought you...

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, yeah, I thought the same thing about you a
     minute ago. We've got to stop that.

  WEIR
     I'd like that.

  SHEPPARD
     (changing the subject) So where are we?

  WEIR
     Well, most of our sensors are still down, but we
     do know there are at least a handful of Wraith
     still in the city.

  SHEPPARD
     I've still got some work to do.

  WEIR
     Before you do anything, Colonel Everett insists on
     speaking with you. He's in the infirmary.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard walks away.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is standing my Everett's infirmary bed.
     Everett has aged significantly as a result of
     having been fed on by the Wraith. His hands are
     shaking and speech is difficult.

  SHEPPARD
     We've neutralized the hive ships, activated the
     shields and we've mustered as many people as we
     can, making sure there's no Wraith hiding in the
     shadows.

  EVERETT
     Good work, Major.

  SHEPPARD
     Thank you, Sir.

  EVERETT
     They're shipping me out with the next batch of
     wounded. I want to finish our conversation.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir.

  EVERETT
     I owe you an apology.

  SHEPPARD
     No, Sir, you don't.

  EVERETT
     I think I have a pretty good idea I would have
     done the same thing as you did when you found
     Colonel Sumner. That's what I wanted to tell you.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, none of that matters right now, Sir.

  EVERETT
     (fighting back tears) I'm trying to say... I wish
     you had been there for me.

  SHEPPARD
     You're going to be fine, Sir. Once you get back to
     Earth...

  EVERETT
     I said what I had to say. Get back to work.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stands to attention and salutes Everett.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard turns and leaves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard enters gate room with Zelenka and they
     approach Weir, who is having a conversation with
     two soldiers.

  ZELENKA
     The preliminary count is forty casualties. Maybe
     more. I'm still trying to line up life signs
     readings with actual people.

  SHEPPARD
     There are no Wraith life signs?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir joins Sheppard and Zelenka and they walk
     across and up the stairs to the control room as
     they talk.

  ZELENKA
     The last one was trapped in one of the deeper
     parts of the city. He died trying to damage the
     city with one of their grenades.

  WEIR
     Three of our men were injured. On the bright side,
     there was no flooding.

  SHEPPARD
     Have we been able to locate Lieutenant Ford yet?

  ZELENKA
     I'm sorry. No. We've searched everywhere in the
     city. It's possible he may have beamed up into one
     of the Wraith darts.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's not make that assumption.

  ZELENKA
     Major, I'm sorry. We've searched everywhere in the
     city.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, how about outside the city?

  ZELENKA
     I don't understand.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, expand the sensors. Maybe he's in the water.

  ZELENKA
     Even if that was the case, there's no chance...

  SHEPPARD
     (frustrated) Look, I'm not asking you to swim out
     there. I'm asking you to press a few damn buttons.

  ZELENKA
     Even if you're right, I don't see how...

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka presses some buttons and the monitor shows
     a blip outside the city perimeter.

  ZELENKA
     Oh my God.

  WEIR
     (into radio) Colonel Caldwell, one of our men is
     in the ocean outside our shield, most probably
     injured. Can you beam him to your ship, then down
     to our infirmary?

  ANNOTATION
     Novak, Hermiod and some other personnel are at a
     console. We only see the light from a beam, but it
     is Novak's horrified expression that tells us
     something is wrong.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  NOVAK
     (over radio) Atlantis? This is Dr. Novak on the
     Daedalus. You're going to need some S.O.s in your
     infirmary before we beam your man down.

  BECKETT
     (into radio) We already do, Doctor. Beam away.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford is beamed into the infirmary with the Wraith
     that was feeding on him when they fell still
     attached by its hand to his chest.

  BECKETT
     Good Lord. Let's get this thing off of him.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett runs to the prone Ford, feeling for a
     pulse.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ford is lying in an infirmary bed, unconscious.
     The camera zooms in on him slowly as we hear the
     conversation.

  SHEPPARD
     (voice) How is he?

  BECKETT
     (voice) I gave him a mild sedative to help him
     rest. But he should be dead.

  SHEPPARD
     (voice) Well, he's a tough kid.

  ANNOTATION
     We now see Weir, Beckett and Sheppard standing
     around Ford's bed.

  BECKETT
     Not my point, Major. He was laying face down in
     the freezing water for over an hour. I don't care
     how tough he is.

  WEIR
     So, what are you saying?

  BECKETT
     We still have no idea how it works, but during the
     Wraith feeding process, the victim is injected
     with a special enzyme. It strengthens the human
     body temporarily and ensures that the heart
     continues to beat.

  SHEPPARD
     Why would they want to make you stronger?

  BECKETT
     So the victim doesn't die immediately. The feeding
     process is so traumatic, without the special
     enzyme we shut down far sooner than they like.

  WEIR
     They make you stronger so they can take more time
     to kill you.

  BECKETT
     Lovely, isn't it? In most cases, the enzyme is
     released slowly into the blood stream throughout
     the feeding process. I can only ascertain that the
     Wraith died quite suddenly and that Lieutenant
     Ford's system became flooded with it.

  WEIR
     And that's why he was able to survive in the water
     for so long.

  BECKETT
     Exactly. The problem is now the enzyme is breaking
     down in his system. Eventually there'll be none
     left.

  SHEPPARD
     That's not good.

  BECKETT
     No. In fact, I'm quite certain it will kill him.
     It's possible his body's become dependent on the
     enzyme to function.

  WEIR
     What's the treatment?

  BECKETT
     We wean him off it, sneak his body chemistry back
     to normal incrementally.

  SHEPPARD
     Then we're going to have to get more of this
     enzyme.

  BECKETT
     Aye. With your permission, Doctor, I'd like to
     harvest it from the Wraith bodies in the morgue. I
     know it's a wee bit creepy, but...

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Elizabeth. Major Sheppard.

  WEIR
     (to Beckett) Do whatever you have to do. (to McKay
     over radio) What is it?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) You're going to want to get up here.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Sheppard leave the infirmary.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka and McKay are working at consoles as Weir
     and Sheppard enter the control room.

  SHEPPARD
     Aren't you supposed to be getting some sleep,
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     I was trying to do just that, but someone thought
     I should know the deep space sensors were back up
     and running.

  WEIR
     Yes, and?

  ZELENKA
     We've picked up twelve more hive ships traveling
     in hyperspace.

  MCKAY
     Their course and speed will bring them here in...
     thirty six hours.

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows a dozen hive ships on course, as
     Weir and Sheppard exchange concerned looks.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Monitors around the room show the progress of the
     hive ships as Caldwell paces past them angrily.

  CALDWELL
     Twelve hive ships?

  SHEPPARD
     The cruisers that got away probably called for
     reinforcements.

  MCKAY
     Our research shows there are at least sixty hive
     ships in this galaxy, so who knows how many more
     could be on the way.

  SHEPPARD
     At least the shield's up and running.

  MCKAY
     That only buys us time.

  SHEPPARD
     I like time.

  MCKAY
     (becoming agitated) The first siege of Atlantis
     lasted for years. I mean, with only one
     functioning ZPM, we can't expect to hold on that
     long.

  CALDWELL
     Can we submerge the city again?

  MCKAY
     (condescendingly) It's a city, not a yo-yo. Look,
     I don't even know how they did it the first time.

  CALDWELL
     How long until they arrive?

  WEIR
     A little over a day.

  SHEPPARD
     You know what? I'm sick of this.

  WEIR
     I'm sorry?

  SHEPPARD
     I mean sitting around waiting for them to show up.
     I say we take the fight to them.

  CALDWELL
     We've got one ship, Major.

  SHEPPARD
     One ship with an Asgard shield, an armory full of
     nukes and beaming technology. That evens the odds
     a hell of a lot.

  CALDWELL
     Twelve ships and their escorts.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm telling you, we've got to send these guys a
     message. We're not like the Ancients. We're not
     going to sit around and wait. If they don't back
     off, we have the capacity and the will to go kick
     their asses for a change.

  CALDWELL
     How do I fight a ship in hyperspace?

  MCKAY
     The Wraith's faster-than-light travel is not as
     efficient as the Asgard hyperdrive aboard the
     Daedalus. (indicating the display on the monitor
     showing the hives' progress) Not only are they
     slower, they need to travel in a series of jumps.
     So, if my calculations are correct, they'll make
     one last stop here, fifty light years away, before
     they make the final jump to Atlantis.

  CALDWELL
     Dr. Weir?

  WEIR
     It will feel good to have them on the defensive
     for a change.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, then. Let's do this.

  BECKETT
     The hell you are. You should be back in bed.

  FORD
     I feel great. Just drop it.

  BECKETT
     I will not "just drop it." Not 20 minutes ago, you
     were at death's door. I don't care how spry you're
     feeling. You need to be under medical supervision.

  FORD
     I'm good to go.

  CALDWELL
     We can get the Daedalus back into fighting form
     within 24 hours, but I think the next engagement's
     going to have the same result.

  WEIR
     Even if we were able to destroy these ships this
     instant, more would be here in a few days, and
     even more a few days after that. From where I'm
     standing, I just don't see how we can win this.

  MCKAY
     Well, now we know how the Ancients must have felt.

  ZELENKA
     Atlantis is the only way to Earth. As long as they
     know we're here, they're just going to keep
     coming.

  SHEPPARD
     "As long as they know that we're here."

  WEIR
     What do you mean?

  SHEPPARD
     Zelenka just said, "As long as they know that
     we're here, they'll keep coming."

  MCKAY
     Yes, he said that.

  SHEPPARD
     What if they thought we were gone?

  TEYLA
     Then there'd be no reason for them to stay.

  SHEPPARD
     Exactly.

  MCKAY
     Exactly what?

  SHEPPARD
     We disappear.

  CALDWELL
     Destroy the city, you mean?

  SHEPPARD
     No, we just make it look like we did.

  WEIR
     How?

  MCKAY
     (clicking his fingers excitedly) We cloak it.

  ZELENKA
     Yes! Yes! The Puddle Jumpers are equipped with
     cloaking technology, which renders them invisible
     to the naked eye and to Wraith scans. If we just
     simply remove one of the cloak generators from the
     Puddle Jumper...

  MCKAY
     I wouldn't say "simply", but, yes. By interfacing
     a Jumper's stealth mode generator with the city
     shield, we should be able to render the city
     invisible.

  CALDWELL
     That's all well and good, but I think if the city
     were to suddenly disappear, they might be able to
     put one and one together.

  MCKAY
     (wagging his finger and smiling smugly) Which is
     why we fake a self-destruct. Have the Daedalus
     beam a nuke right above the city shield and then
     detonate it. While their sensors are blinded, we
     cloak the city. When the smoke clears...

  WEIR
     Nothing but ocean.

  CALDWELL
     What about hard radiation?

  MCKAY
     I should be able to calculate with reasonable
     accuracy how long to wait before we switch over to
     cloak.

  ZELENKA
     What about the displacement issue?

  MCKAY
     That's coplanar emulation. That's the easy part.

  ZELENKA
     Okay. What about the hard part?

  SHEPPARD
     Hard part?

  MCKAY
     The cloak, for all intents and purposes, will
     replace the shield, which means that we'll be
     completely unprotected once the cloak's activated.

  WEIR
     We'll be completely exposed?

  MCKAY
     Well, yes.

  CALDWELL
     So if they're not fooled by the ruse...

  SHEPPARD
     Then they destroy the city. Which, I remind you,
     is exactly what we were going to do anyway.

  WEIR
     What about the Daedalus?

  CALDWELL
     Well, if it doesn't work, our shield should be
     sufficiently recharged to break through their
     lines and escape. We know we can outrun them.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. Let's get as many non-essential
     personnel onto your ship as we can, just in case.

  WEIR
     I love this idea, I really do, but the Wraith are
     aware that we have cloaking technology.

  TEYLA
     They are close. Close enough for me to connect to
     them. If I can convince them that we intend to
     destroy Atlantis rather than allow it to be taken,
     just before the explosion occurs...

  WEIR
     How will we know whether or not they believe you?

  SHEPPARD
     Once they stop the bombardment, we'll know.

  TEYLA
     He's right. If the Wraith believe that we intend
     to destroy the city, the last thing they'll want
     to do is to help us do it.

  WEIR
     How much time do you need?

  MCKAY
     Oh, uh...

  ZELENKA
     A week.

  MCKAY
     Couple of hours.

  WEIR
     I'll take the second estimate. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     As everyone gets up to leave, McKay looks
     derisively at Zelenka.

  MCKAY
     (snarkily) What, are you union?

  ZELENKA
     (annoyed) "Couple of hours."

     Beckett runs up the stairs from the gate room.

  BECKETT
     He escaped.

  TEYLA
     What?

  SHEPPARD
     Who?

  BECKETT
     Ford. He was able to disarm one of the Marines and
     got away with all the Wraith enzyme I had left.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Ford, this is Sheppard. Come in.
     Ford, I need you to come back to the control room,
     buddy. We're all going home.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ford is sitting in a darkened corridor having just
     injected himself with some of the Wraith enzyme.
     He still has the rest in I.V. bags.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Lieutenant, do you copy?

  FORD
     (into radio) You're just afraid of me, Major.
     You're afraid of what I can do now. I'm not
     listening to you.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  SHEPPARD
     I'm going after him.

     covering their eyes as Rodney takes off his
     eyewear and anxiously checks a computer.

  WEIR
     Rodney?

  MCKAY
     If we switch to the cloak before the blast radius
     diminishes, we'll all be incinerated. Five
     seconds.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is advancing along a darkened corridor
     with the Wraith stun weapon ready to fire. He
     approaches Ford, who is standing in the light, his
     weapon aimed at Sheppard.

  FORD
     I could've shot you a couple of times by now.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard lowers his weapon.

  SHEPPARD
     Well... I'm glad you didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Ford lowers his weapon.

  SHEPPARD
     (advancing slowly) Look, why don't you and I just
     go someplace where we can talk.

  FORD
     (backing away) You're trying to change me back.

  SHEPPARD
     (still advancing) No. I'm just trying to help you.

  FORD
     (shakes his head) No, you're not.

  ANNOTATION

     Oh, crap.

  ANNOTATION

     he punches a destination on the console. As the
     transporter doors close, Sheppard runs towards
     them, but when they open again, Ford is gone.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (whispering) I don't think they've detected us.

  WEIR
     (whispering) Why are you whispering?

  MCKAY

     to do.

  WEIR
     Is it working or not?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka is walking along punching buttons on a
     handheld device. As he turns from one corridor

     The Stargate starts dialling.

  WEIR
     What the hell?!

  ANNOTATION
     Ford is at the controls of a Jumper, dialing the
     'gate.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works at the console. Sheppard runs in.

  SHEPPARD
     Where's Ford?

  MCKAY
     (angrily) I assume that's him in that Jumper.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Jumper descends and positions itself in front
     of the open wormhole.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     Can they detect that?

  MCKAY
     I don't know.

  WEIR
     Shut it down.

  MCKAY
     I can't. The Jumper's in control.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Ford is at the Jumper controls and Sheppard is
     standing in front of it.

  SHEPPARD
     Ford! Stand down! This is a direct order!

  ANNOTATION
     Ford looks defiantly at Sheppard then flies the
     Jumper through the 'gate. The wormhole
     disconnects. Sheppard is left standing by the
     'gate.

  SHEPPARD
     (calling up to the control room) Where the hell is
     he going?

  WEIR
     It won't matter if the Wraith can detect the gate
     activity through the cloak.

  MCKAY
     There's only one way to know.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Weir stand in silence, listening for
     sounds of Wraith attack.

  CALDWELL
     (over radio) This is Daedalus. Our sensors
     indicate the Wraith fleet is breaking orbit.

  MCKAY
     (checking his computer) I can confirm that.
     They're headed for hyperspace. (relieved) Look,
     I'm going to keep the cloak up for a while just to
     be sure, but, uh...I think they bought it.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is still standing in front of the 'gate
     as Weir goes to join him.

  WEIR
     The gate address will be in the log. There's still
     a chance...

  SHEPPARD
     Doesn't matter where he goes. The second he gets
     to wherever he's going, he's going to ditch the
     Jumper, turn around, and dial another address, one
     we can't trace.

  WEIR
     We'll find him.

  SHEPPARD
     Maybe.

  WEIR
     Hey. At least we're still around to try.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard walks away.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The city appears from the cloak.
