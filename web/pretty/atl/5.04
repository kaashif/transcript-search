The Daedalus Variations
TEASER

LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay leave the briefing room amongst
     other Atlantis personnel, including Lorne and
     Zelenka.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

  MCKAY
     I'm telling you, she's hiding him from me.

  SHEPPARD
     She's not hiding him.

  MCKAY
     Oh, yeah? Every time I go to see him, she tells me
     that he's "just settled down."

  SHEPPARD
     Can you blame her? You dropped him.

  MCKAY
     I did not drop him, he jumped!

  SHEPPARD
     Jumped?

  MCKAY
     Well, he wiggled out of my arms. Look, I said I
     was sorry. Besides, how much damage could I
     possibly have done? He fell like, maybe two feet.
     Stuff like that happens all the time. I mean, I
     was dropped, like, a dozen times when I was kid.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that explains a lot. Why do you even care?
     You don't even like kids!

  MCKAY
     It's the principle of the thing. Everyone else
     gets to hold him, why shouldn't I?

  ANNOTATION
     The have arrived at the control room.

  CHUCK
     Colonel? We got a new contact. Looks like a ship.

  SHEPPARD
     How far out?

  CHUCK
     It's in orbit.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, how come we didn't detect it?

  CHUCK
     I don't know. We didn't even detect a hyperspace
     window. It just appeared out of nowhere.

  MCKAY
     (studying his display) Hang on a second, we're
     getting IFF. It's the Daedalus.

  SHEPPARD
     The Daedalus? How can that be? They're on their
     way back to Earth.

  MCKAY
     (puzzled) Well, they were...or they were supposed
     to be.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Chuck) Open up a channel.

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck punches some controls and points to Sheppard
     who keys his radio.

  SHEPPARD
     Daedalus, this is Atlantis. Please come in...
     Daedalus, please respond.

  MCKAY
     (worried) They're not going to answer.

  SHEPPARD
     Why not?

  MCKAY
     Because I'm not reading any life signs.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you telling me, Rodney? This thing flew
     here by itself?

  MCKAY
     I don't know how they got here, but there's no one
     on board. At least, no one alive.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A jumper flies from Atlantis towards the Daedalus.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team is in the jumper.

  CHUCK
     (over radio) Colonel, we just got confirmation
     from Stargate Command. The Daedalus is in the
     Milky Way, on course and on schedule. They expect
     to reach Earth within two days.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Understood.

  RONON
     So, that's not the Daedalus, then?

  SHEPPARD
     Well...not unless it can be in two places at once.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps the Apollo, or one of your other ships...?

  MCKAY
     (dismissively) They wouldn't be sending Daedalus
     IFF, plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or
     why we're not picking up life sign readings.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, I'm taking us in for a closer look.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon leans forward to look with Sheppard and
     McKay.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper flies underneath the 304. The ship is
     badly damaged, with scorch marks covering its
     hull.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     Wow, do you see that?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, some scorch marks. You think weapon's fire?

  SHEPPARD
     Mmm. Well, wherever she's been, she's been through
     some tough times.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm in the jumper beeps.

  SHEPPARD
     What's that?

  MCKAY
     (perplexed) I'm picking up an energy reading. It's
     coming from the ship.

  TEYLA
     Is it dangerous?

  MCKAY
     I don't think so, but I have no idea what's
     causing it.

  SHEPPARD
     Can you get the bay doors open?

  MCKAY
     If the ship's command systems are as familiar as
     the rest it, it shouldn't be a problem.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS HANGAR BAY

  ANNOTATION
     The outer doors open and the jumper flies close to
     the entrance.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     No F-302s...but...there's a jumper.

  RONON
     You sure there's no one else inside?

  MCKAY
     (nervously) As far as I can tell.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, we're going in.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper flies into the hangar bay.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS HANGAR BAY

  ANNOTATION
     The team exits the jumper.

  TEYLA
     Why is it so cold in here?

  MCKAY
     The ship's operating on emergency power. Some of
     the systems are barely registering.

  RONON
     (drily) Except for the whole "weird energy thing."

  MCKAY
     That's right.

  SHEPPARD
     Can you do something about it? It's freezing in
     here.

  MCKAY
     (piqued) Oh sure, I just have to get to
     engineering.

  SHEPPARD
     You and Ronon are together. Teyla, you and I are
     going to check out the bridge. Radio me if you
     find anything.

  ANNOTATION
     They split up.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Sheppard enter cautiously.

  SHEPPARD
     No bodies in here.

  TEYLA
     Colonel...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard joins Teyla, and they both look at the
     plaque on the wall for the Daedalus

  SHEPPARD
     It's the Daedalus all right.

  ANNOTATION
     The lights suddenly turn on.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) McKay, is that you?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Of course it was me. Who else would
     it be?


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  MCKAY
     (smugly) you think we've got a ghost on board or
     something?

  ANNOTATION
     Behind McKay, Ronon causes a large metallic
     clatter, scaring him.

  MCKAY
     Will you please not touch anything?!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon shrugs innocently.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) What's our status?

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between the
     two locations.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  MCKAY
     I've restored basic power to most of the ship. It
     should be warming up any second now.

  SHEPPARD
     Good. Check on that energy reading. Try to figure
     out what it is, all right?

  MCKAY
     (exasperated) I'm on it.

  TEYLA
     Colonel...ship's log, last entry.

  ANNOTATION
     She types on a few controls. A woman appears on
     the screen.

  SOBEL
     Preparations are almost complete. We've beamed
     down the last of our supplies and any equipment we
     think might be useful. I'll be taking the last of
     the F-302s down myself. Of course, we haven't had
     time to do a proper survey of the planet's
     surface, but it seems habitable enough. Plenty of
     fresh water. Arable soil. Not that different from
     our own. I realize our chance of rescue is slim.
     But it's become obvious that we no longer have a
     choice. This is Colonel Sobel, commander of the
     Daedalus, signing off.

  TEYLA
     Do you recognize her?

  SHEPPARD
     I've never seen her before in my life.

  TEYLA
     Well, it appears as if they abandoned ship.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah. The question is: why?

  TEYLA
     I'll check previous entries.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts typing on the controls.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  MCKAY
     Man, this ship has been through the wringer. No
     hyperdrive. Subspace communications are all
     damaged beyond repair. The shields are virtually
     depleted.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm begins to beep.

  RONON
     What is it.

  MCKAY
     (looking at displays) It's the energy reading.
     It's spiking. (into radio) Sheppard, come in.

  SHEPPARD
     Go ahead.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Something's happening. The energy
     reading. It's going off the charts!


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Do something! Turn it off.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  MCKAY
     I don't know how. Look, it's not coming from any
     of the main systems!


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  LORNE
     (over radio) Colonel Sheppard, this is Atlantis.
     We're picking up some kind of power surge coming
     from the ship.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we noticed it, and we're trying to check it
     out ourselves.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ZELENKA
     (shaking his head) The levels are still rising.

  LORNE
     (into radio) Colonel, should we send another
     jumper to assist?

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Stand by.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Sheppard feel the ship rumbling around
     them.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and McKay look around at the shaking walls.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     All right, that's our cue to leave. Everyone back
     in the jumper.

  ANNOTATION
     They start to leave. Sheppard and Teyla aren't out
     of the room before they're blinded by a bright
     light.

  SHEPPARD
     Gah!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Daedalus is surrounded by a bright light, then
     disappears in a blink.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) McKay, what the hell was that?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) I have no idea, but the energy
     reading's gone back down the way it was.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Atlantis, you reading anything
     unusual? Atlantis, come in.

  ANNOTATION
     There is no response. Sheppard reaches over and
     opens the channel on the commander's chair.

  SHEPPARD
     Atlantis, do you read?


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  LORNE
     Colonel Sheppard, do you read? Daedalus, this is
     Atlantis, please respond. (to Zelenka) What the
     hell's going on?

  ZELENKA
     I don't know. One moment they were there, and the
     next minute, they were gone.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between and the bridge
     and engineering.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Rodney, I'm having problems with
     communications. I can't reach Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay is distracted by a display.

  MCKAY
     Wait a second. That can't be right.

  RONON
     What?

  MCKAY
     I'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla approach the front window.

  MCKAY
     I just did a sensor sweep, and there's nothing
     down there but ocean!

  SHEPPARD
     Well, maybe they cloaked.

  MCKAY
     Well, they wouldn't have done that without telling
     us.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I don't know. Maybe there's a Wraith ship in
     the area.

  MCKAY
     (insistently) I'm not reading anything.

  TEYLA
     Are we certain it's the same planet? Perhaps the
     energy burst shifted our position.

  MCKAY
     No. According to our instruments, we haven't moved
     at all.

  SHEPPARD
     What do you want me to believe, Rodney? That
     Atlantis just disappeared?

  MCKAY
     I-I don't know. Just, give me a second. I'll
     figure it out, all right? In the meantime, I've
     managed to localize the source of the energy
     reading. It's coming from a hold on Deck Nine.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon heads out.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, keep trying to reach Atlantis. We'll
     check it out.


LOCATION--DECK NINE CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon, Teyla, and Sheppard have met up and head
     towards the hold.

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches from McKay's spot in
     engineering to the rest of the team on Deck Nine.

  MCKAY
     Sheppard, I think I've got something. It's the
     residual radiation from the flash. It-it's similar
     to what happens when you open a hyperspace window.
     But different enough that the sensors wouldn't
     have picked it up automatically.

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell does that mean?

  MCKAY
     I think we're looking at a new kind of drive.

  TEYLA
     I thought you said we didn't go anywhere.

  MCKAY
     We didn't. At least, according to the ship's
     navigational systems.

  SHEPPARD
     So, a...malfunctioning drive.

  MCKAY
     Maybe, just...hang on.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard reaches the door to the chamber and opens
     it.


LOCATION--ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The team enters and fans out.

  MCKAY
     Oh my god! Sheppard!

  SHEPPARD
     Stand by, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     No, you don't understand. I know what it is! Look,
     the residual radiation--it, it's exactly what we
     recorded when my double arrived on Atlantis from
     an alternate reality. I can't believe I didn't see
     this before!

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon gestures to the far end of the room.

  RONON
     Sheppard, hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Teyla come over.

  MCKAY
     (continuing) It's a drive all right. But it didn't
     move us through space. I think it's moved us into
     a parallel universe.

  SHEPPARD
     (stunned) That would explain a lot of things.

  ANNOTATION
     He, Teyla, and Ronon stare at alternate versions
     of themselves and McKay lying dead on the floor.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Ronon finishes putting a thermal blanket
     over the dead alternate McKay. The others are
     already covered. McKay is with the team now.

  RONON
     Oh, how long have they been dead for?

  SHEPPARD
     The place was like a meat locker. They could've
     been preserved like this for months.

  TEYLA
     (disturbed) They look just like us.

  MCKAY
     That's because they are us. The alternate reality
     versions of us.

  TEYLA
     I feel like someone just walked over my grave.

  SHEPPARD
     Take it easy, everything's fine.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay studies a computer.

  MCKAY
     Oh, no, no, no, no. This is very bad.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     This tablet belonged to the other McKay. They
     weren't part of the original crew. They came here
     just like us! Look, a ship appeared in orbit over
     their Atlantis. They came to check it out!

  SHEPPARD
     That would explain the other jumper in the bay.

  MCKAY
     (very worried) The ship jumped in another reality,
     and they were stuck. They-they couldn't get back.
     Look, eventually, their supplies ran out, and
     they...

  SHEPPARD
     All right, all right, mystery solved. Let's move
     on.

  MCKAY
     (panicked) Don't you realize what this means? They
     were us, and they failed!

  SHEPPARD
     (firmly) Well, they're not us! We're still alive!
     Let's go!

  ANNOTATION
     He leads them down the corridor.


LOCATION--ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     They reenter the room.

  SHEPPARD
     The answer's in here somewhere. Can you, uh, power
     up the systems?

  MCKAY
     Uh...yeah, just hold on.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay opens a junction box.

  MCKAY
     All right...

  ANNOTATION
     He starts hitting some switches and the lights
     turn on, the equipment powering up.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, that's a start.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon notices a sealed door with several warning
     signs.

  RONON
     What's behind here?

  MCKAY
     Huh. That's a good question.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks over to the control panel and hits some
     keys. The door opens. A large cylindrical device
     is revealed. It spins slowly.

  MCKAY
     I'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.

  SHEPPARD
     Can you figure out how to control it?

  MCKAY
     (piqued) Offhand, I'd say no. That's what the
     other McKay was trying to do, and he had...weeks!

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney...

  MCKAY
     Fine. I'll start with his research. It'll...at
     least give us a head start.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, that's better. We're going to look for
     supplies.

  MCKAY
     Wha-you don't think the other us would've already
     tried that?

  SHEPPARD
     (sternly) Get to work.


LOCATION--SUPPLY ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon scavenges through containers. Teyla enters.

  TEYLA
     Did you find anything?

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up a drill.

  RONON
     Not unless you know a way to cook this.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps we should consider going down to the
     planet to collect supplies.

  RONON
     Nah, Sheppard says it's too risky. The drive could
     kick in and the ship could take off without us.
     Then we'd be stuck here.

  TEYLA
     The others that we found...do you think their
     lives were very similar to ours?

  RONON
     Who cares?

  TEYLA
     How can you say that?

  RONON
     We've seen our doubles before.

  TEYLA
     Eh, Replicator manufactured copies. These were
     real people with real lives! I can't help but
     wondering who might still be waiting for her back
     on her Atlantis.

  RONON
     Do you mean, did she also have a son?

  TEYLA
     The thought had crossed my mind.

  RONON
     Look....I, uh, I've heard McKay talk about this
     stuff before. And, supposedly, there's a million
     different realities out there, with every possible
     variation, which also means there's a million
     different Torrens. You going to worry about every
     one of them?

  TEYLA
     (considering) No. It's difficult enough worrying
     about one.

  RONON
     I'll bet it is. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Daedalus floats in space.


LOCATION--ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard enters, and notices the shielding door is
     closed again as McKay studies the computers.

  SHEPPARD
     Why is the blast door closed?

  MCKAY
     Hello, residual radiation?

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, right. Have you made any progress?

  MCKAY
     As a matter of fact, yes, we have.

  SHEPPARD
     We?

  MCKAY
     Me and the other McKay, who unsurprisingly, is a
     genius. Not only that, but it looks like the drive
     was created by yet another McKay from the original
     reality.

  SHEPPARD
     What makes you say that?

  MCKAY
     Well, there's a certain, um,...elegance to the
     design that I recognize.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm sure that's what the crew was saying when they
     abandoned ship.

  MCKAY
     Well, admittedly, there are problems, but it is
     still a monumental achievement.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, so-so...what do we do? Can we just
     throw the thing in reverse?

  MCKAY
     Uh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than
     that. The first problem is navigation. They've
     developed a coordinate system to, uh, identify the
     various realities and allowed them to get back.
     But, uh, obviously that didn't work.

  SHEPPARD
     Obviously.

  MCKAY
     (sighing) That's not what bothers me.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, it kind of bothers me.

  MCKAY
     It's power generation. I mean, jumping from one
     reality to another requires massive amounts of
     power. We're talking ZPM levels here. Obviously
     they didn't have one of those rattling around, so
     they...created a capacitor that's constantly
     drawing power from subspace.

  ANNOTATION
     The alarm that alerts when the energy spikes
     sounds again.

  MCKAY
     And...it looks like it's almost charged.

  SHEPPARD
     Is this your long-winded way of telling me you
     just can't turn it off?

  MCKAY
     Think of it like a-a tap pouring water into a
     bucket. When the bucket is full, the drive
     engages. Except this particular tap has no valve.

  SHEPPARD
     That seems like a pretty serious design flaw,
     don't you think?

  MCKAY
     Exactly. Which leads me to believe they were
     tampering with it in a vain attempt to generate
     more power.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship starts to rumble and the drive starts to
     show it's close to 100% charged.

  MCKAY
     As they got further and further from their own
     reality, I guess they figured they'd need it to
     get back. And...here we go.

  ANNOTATION
     The drive engages and the light washes over them.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay. Where are we?

  MCKAY
     Oh, don't look at me. I haven't had time to route
     the main systems to these control panels. I'm
     flying blind down here.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Ronon, Teyla, meet me at the bridge.

  TEYLA
     (over radio) On our way.

  SHEPPARD
     Keep it up, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     (noncommittally) Uhn.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard arrives to find Ronon and Teyla already
     there. Teyla smiles, relieved, and works more
     controls.

  TEYLA
     Colonel, Atlantis is back. I'm picking them up on
     the sensors.

  SHEPPARD
     You know how to work this stuff?

  TEYLA
     The last time the Daedalus was in orbit, Major
     Marks generously offered to give both of us some
     preliminary training.

  ANNOTATION
     She gives Ronon a pointed look.

  RONON
     I was busy.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Atlantis, this is Sheppard, come
     in...Atlantis, do you read...?

  ANNOTATION
     Hearing no response, he reaches over and keys the
     radio on a control panel of the ship.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Atlantis, this is Sheppard, come in.

  RONON
     (shrugging) Maybe they already have a Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio, to McKay) Rodney, what are the odds
     of us, uh, randomly jumping back into our
     own...reality?

  MCKAY
     I'd say slim to none.

  TEYLA
     I'm...detecting another ship in orbit.

  SHEPPARD
     (concerned) What kind?

  TEYLA
     I'll see if I can pull it up on screen.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't recognize it. What's that?

  ANNOTATION
     He points to an insignia on the hull. Teyla
     magnifies that section of the ship.

  RONON
     You know it?

  SHEPPARD
     No.

  TEYLA
     Colonel, I believe this ship is powering weapons.

  SHEPPARD
     What's our shield status?

  TEYLA
     Minimal.

     It's firing on Atlantis.

  TEYLA
     The city's shields are failing.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Rodney, do we have enough juice to
     power up the Asgard beam?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Maybe. I mean, you might be able to
     get a couple of shots off. Why?

  SHEPPARD
     There's some alien ship attacking Atlantis.

  MCKAY
     So?

  SHEPPARD
     What do you mean, so? It's Atlantis!

  MCKAY
     Well, I mean...it's not our Atlantis. We have no
     idea who's down there. Look, we should just stay
     out of it!

  TEYLA
     If we do not intervene, the city will be
     destroyed!

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we need help. My gut tells me we're better
     off going with the people on that planet then
     whoever's on that ship.

  MCKAY
     I hope you're right.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, me too.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard hurries over to study the displays.

  SHEPPARD
     Here. Seal off damaged areas. We should be okay
     for the moment.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves her to it and sits back at the port
     station.

  RONON
     Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Sheppard! I have an idea!

  SHEPPARD
     Let's hear it.

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between the
     bridge and drive room.

  MCKAY
     I set up a few protocols that should increase the
     efficiency of the alternate reality drive. If I
     enable them, we might be able to jump sooner.

  SHEPPARD
     Like what? What? Jump to the next universe?

  MCKAY
     Exactly! But if I do this, I can't undo it! I
     mean, we'll just start jumping faster and faster.

  ANNOTATION
     More blasts rock the ship. The team exchange
     worried looks.

  SHEPPARD
     Do it!

     million kilometers from the surface of the sun.

  SHEPPARD
     I thought we always jumped to the same place in
     every reality.

  TEYLA
     As did I.

  ANNOTATION
     A klaxon blares. Teyla checks it.

  TEYLA
     Hull temperature is approaching critical. If we do
     not restore shields...

  SHEPPARD
     We're going to burn.

  MCKAY
     (skeptical, into radio) Are you sure about this?

     Rodney.


LOCATION--ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between the
     two locations.

  MCKAY
     Well, let me transfer down to this station. Then
     at least I can...ooh...well, you're definitely not
     imagining that.

  SHEPPARD
     Thanks for the vote of confidence.

  MCKAY
     I don't understand it! We always jump to the same
     relative position in space! Unless...

  SHEPPARD
     Unless what?

  MCKAY
     You said when you went to the future, you saw our
     sun expanding into a red giant, remember?

  SHEPPARD
     What are you saying? We're jumping through time
     now?

  MCKAY
     No. No-no-no-no-no. But maybe what eventually
     happens in our reality is happening in this one,
     only much sooner. Look, we didn't go to the sun,
     the sun came to us.

  RONON
     So, how does this help us?

  MCKAY
     I-I don't know. I just, I found it interesting.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon rolls his eyes.

  SHEPPARD
     (barely keeping his temper) What's "interesting",
     Rodney, is a way out of this without getting
     fried--like getting the sub-light back on, so we
     can get the hell out of here.

  MCKAY
     Actually, I think our best bet is just to transfer
     as much power as we can to the shields and ride it
     out to the next jump.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. When does that happen?

  MCKAY
     Well, the time the capacitor takes to charge now
     that I've enacted those new protocols. You know,
     um...I have no idea.

  SHEPPARD
     You're not exactly selling the plan, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     (defensively) I have no idea how long it would
     take me to fix sub-lights, either! Look, I've got
     to run a diagnostic, but theoretically,
     transferring power to the shields should be
     relatively easy.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, what do we do?

  MCKAY
     All right, the first thing I need you to do is
     head down to engineering.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Teyla) Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the bridge.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     The trio head through the debris of a corridor and
     enter engineering.

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between the drive
     chamber where McKay is, and where the others are
     in engineering.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, we're here. What do we do?

  MCKAY
     You need to kill all power to non-essential decks
     which means you're gonna have to access the main
     administrative interface. That should bring up a
     list of all available override commands.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla does so.

  SHEPPARD
     Got it.

  MCKAY
     Okay. So choose the command for life support;
     you're gonna have to designate the decks one by
     one.

  ANNOTATION
     While Teyla follows McKay's instructions. Ronon
     hears something in the corridor outside. He goes
     to investigate.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon patrols the hall. He pauses, looking around,
     but sees nothing. He starts to head back when he
     hears a thump on the other side of a sealed door.
     He pulls out his pistol and walks over. He opens
     the door to find a large alien on the other side.
     The alien is grey, tall, with pointed teeth. It
     wears armor and has a blinking red mechanical
     light on its forehead. Both Ronon and the alien
     are startled by each other's appearance. Ronon
     starts to raise his weapon, but the alien grabs
     his hand, then grabs his throat and knocks him
     against the bulkhead several times.


LOCATION--ENGINEERING ROOM

  TEYLA
     I think that's all of them.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Dammit. That didn't buy us nearly as
     much power as I would've thought.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, there's got to be something else.

  MCKAY
     Right, um...all right, look, the ship has
     auxiliary power modules for most of the main
     systems. Uh, most likely they're depleted, but,
     uh, if not, well, it might buy us a little more
     juice.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, there you go.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon is pinned to the floor, still in the
     chokehold as the alien roars at him. Ronon punches
     the alien in the head several times but can't get
     released. His pinned arm still holds his weapon,
     desperate, he fires it several times at the wall
     as a signal.

     Teyla and Sheppard grab their weapons and look
     wary as they hear the distant sound of Ronon's
     weapon.

     it gunfire?

  SHEPPARD
     Where's Ronon?

  SHEPPARD
     (to Teyla) Keep working.

  ANNOTATION

     the console again.

  TEYLA
     (into radio) Stay focused, Rodney. Tell me what to
     do next.


LOCATION--ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM

  MCKAY
     (nervous) All right.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sees Ronon's situation. He raises his
     rifle and fires several shots at the alien. The
     shots mostly bounce off the alien's armor, but get
     his attention, and he leaves Ronon to head towards
     Sheppard. Now free, Ronon starts firing at the
     alien from behind. The combined shots from Ronon
     and Sheppard finally take down the alien.

  SHEPPARD
     You okay?

  RONON
     (hoarsely) Yeah. Where the hell did he come from?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon struggles to his feet as Sheppard bends over
     the body. He spots an insignia on the armor.

  SHEPPARD
     Check it out. It's the same symbol that was on the
     alien ship.

  RONON
     How'd he get onboard?

  SHEPPARD
     You know, they crashed into us, penetrated our
     hull, remember?

  RONON
     You think he did it on purpose?

  SHEPPARD
     That's a good question.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon finds a sidearm on the body. He unholsters
     it and holds it up.

  RONON
     Hey...?

  ANNOTATION
     They stare at it curiously. Ronon aims into the
     distance and fires. It shoot soft a green energy
     blast.

  SHEPPARD
     Let me try that--

     Two more aliens appear at the other end of the
     corridor and start firing at Ronon and Sheppard,
     who take cover and return fire.

     She stands and grabs her rifle.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) No-no-no-no-no. It's not enough.

  TEYLA
     What do you mean?

  MCKAY
     Without sub-lights, our orbit is decaying, which
     means more radiation slamming into the shields.
     The alternate reality drive is only charged to
     seventy percent! Which means it'll never make one
     hundred before the shields fail!

  TEYLA
     Well, what do we do? We have no more power.

     induce a jump.

  TEYLA
     Hopefully?

  MCKAY
     It is our only option, and every second we argue
     about it is less of a chance it's going to work!

     advantage of the bright light of the jump. While
     the aliens are blinded, they come out of cover and
     start firing on the enemy, downing them both. One
     falls to his knees, Ronon pistol whips him to the

     Now what?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) I think I've overtaxed the drive.
     Look, it's not completely blown, but...we've only
     got a handful of jumps before it's burned out.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, then what happens?

  MCKAY
     If we haven't found our way back by then, we will
     be stranded forever.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sits at the starboard station. Ronon and
     Teyla stare out the front window. An asteroid
     field floats in front of them.

  RONON
     What happened to the planet?

  TEYLA
     Rodney believes that in this reality, it was
     destroyed by an impact, possibly millions of years
     ago. All that remains is this asteroid field.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters.

  MCKAY
     All right, I think I got something. In fact, it
     was staring me in the face the whole time, I was
     too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice
     it.

  SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

  MCKAY
     See, my mistake was focusing on the navigation
     system. I should've known that was never going to
     work.

  RONON
     So what, then?

  MCKAY
     So, in a spectacular feat of multi-dimensional
     mathematics, I have discovered a way to send the
     ship back along the path it's previously traveled,
     bypassing the navigation system altogether.

  SHEPPARD
     Wait a minute. You're talking about putting this
     thing in reverse?

  MCKAY
     (pleased) Exactly.

  SHEPPARD
     (annoyed) I just suggested that two hours ago.

  MCKAY
     And naturally, I dismissed it out of hand. But
     then I realized, that including the original
     designer, not one, but two versions of myself have
     failed to make this thing work. I had to think not
     like me. In fact, I had to think like the opposite
     of me, and it doesn't get much more opposite than
     you.

  SHEPPARD
     I'll take that as a compliment.

  RONON
     So, can we get back or not?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay moves to the port station.

  MCKAY
     Well, not directly. It's impossible to calculate
     the relative position of our original starting
     point from where we are now. But we can retrace
     our steps, passing through each reality in turn
     until we reach the right one.

  SHEPPARD
     We have a slight problem, Rodney. We barely got
     out of those realities alive.

  TEYLA
     If we do not restore the shields, the radiation
     from the red giant will kill us.

  MCKAY
     Not necessarily. Look, we know that the ship
     carries its momentum in real space from one
     reality to the next. Now, we may not have
     sub-light engines, but we do have maneuvering
     thrusters. You know, one long continuous burn
     along the right trajectory, from now until the
     next jump should be enough to allow us to
     establish a-a higher, more stable orbit around the
     sun.

  TEYLA
     So the radiation will not affect us?

  MCKAY
     (reluctantly) Well, I wouldn't go that far, but at
     least it'll be, uh...not quite as deadly?

  ANNOTATION
     He punches a few buttons.

  MCKAY
     Okay, that's it. Course is already plotted.

  SHEPPARD
     Wait--what about those alien dudes? They know
     we're the ones that shot at them.

  RONON
     Maybe they'll be gone.

  MCKAY
     Well, I wouldn't count on it. Look, time is
     passing at the same rate in each of the realities,
     which means...well, which means it hasn't been
     that long. To get past those aliens, we're going
     to need sub-light engines. And I'm going to need
     to fix them in time.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to leave.

  SHEPPARD
     Wait-wait-wait. You said you didn't even know
     what's wrong with those.

  MCKAY
     So, I haven't had a chance to check it out. I'm
     sorry, I can't do ten things at once. I already
     told you, the drive is going to burn out. Soon! We
     have to do something! Who's to say the next
     reality won't be even worse?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon rolls his eyes but complies.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus blinks into the new reality.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  RONON
     Where's the alien ship?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not sure.

  RONON
     Well, maybe they left.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm beeps.

  SHEPPARD
     No such luck. They're right behind us.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The alien ships sets up directly behind Daedalus.
     The ship launches its fighters.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     We've got fighters closing on our position. How's
     it going down there?


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     McKay frantically moves to a control station.

  MCKAY
     Look, just give me a second.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney!


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     McKay studies his monitors, apparently seeing what
     he wants. He turns to Teyla and points.

  MCKAY
     Okay, try it now.

  ANNOTATION
     She presses some controls and the drive powers up.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) That's it, I've got it! Go, go, go,
     go, go, go!


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard activates the controls.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The sub-light engines power up and the ship starts
     flying away from the fighters.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  MCKAY
     Sheppard...how we doing?


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard checks his readouts.

  SHEPPARD
     They're gaining on us. Can you get us more speed?

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the conversation switches between
     engineering and the bridge.

  MCKAY
     There's not a chance. Look, I barely got this
     thing working as it is! If we tax it any more,
     we're going to blow the whole system!

  SHEPPARD
     Well, then we've got a real problem.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon studies the controls, seeing the fighters
     come closer. Sparks short circuit on the bridge.

  RONON
     They're in weapons range!

  SHEPPARD
     Return fire!

  RONON
     (frustrated) I'm trying!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The fighters fire on Daedalus as they catch up to
     the larger ship.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Frustrated, Ronon begins banging blindly on the
     control panel.

  SHEPPARD
     Easy, Chewie, th-th-those buttons are your
     friends. Just keep trying!

  RONON
     (angry) I'm trying!


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  ANNOTATION
     The sub-light drive powers down.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) That's it, sub-lights are gone for
     good this time!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus stops accelerating. It is bombarded by
     the fighters. The rail guns return fire. Suddenly,
     the lead fighter is destroyed by a bomb from
     another ship. Many F-302s dogfight the alien
     fighters over the crippled Daedalus.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  RONON
     What the hell was that?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard studies his monitors.

  SHEPPARD
     F-302s. It's Atlantis.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The fighters are on the run from the F-302s as
     they continue to do battle.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

  MCKAY
     (nervously) What's happening?


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Looks like we're getting some help
     from some friends. Guess we bet on the right side
     after all.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Daedalus, this is Lieutenant Colonel
     John Sheppard. Do you read?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon appear nonplussed.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (more insistently, over radio) Daedalus, do you
     read?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Uh...yeah, Daedalus, this is
     Daedalus, come in.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (puzzled, over radio) Who...who is this?

  SHEPPARD
     It's a long story.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Well, whoever you are, you saved our
     asses when you....


LOCATION--F-302 COCKPIT

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (into radio) took out their main weapons. Figured
     the least we could do is return the favor.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     Much appreciated.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm beeps insistently.

  RONON
     Uh, Sheppard...?

  ANNOTATION
     He clears his throat and points.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A damaged alien fighter approaches, heading
     directly for the bridge of the ship.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon ducks behind his station.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, crap!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard frantically presses the rail gun fire
     button. It explodes the tailspinning fighter just
     as it is about to reach the ship.


LOCATION--F-302 COCKPIT

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Sorry about that. One of them got
     through. Nice shooting, though.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon still appear shaken by the
     close call.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, thanks.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The dogfight continues around the Daedalus.
     Finally, all the alien fighters are destroyed.


LOCATION--F-302 COCKPIT

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     All right, that looks like that's the last of them
     so...uh, so what happens now?


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and McKay enter.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Well, we go our own ways.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Just like that?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Pretty much.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and McKay exchange bemused looks at the
     radio conversation.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Well, the thing is...uh, we do have a
     few questions. See, the Daedalus we know was
     destroyed two years ago in a battle with the
     Replicators.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Sorry to hear that, but...this isn't
     exactly our Daedalus. We're just...borrowing it
     for a while.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (slowly, over radio) Okay, I have no idea what
     that means.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Well, like I said, it's a long story.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (sighing, over radio) All right, Daedalus, good
     luck.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Thank you, Colonel, and one last
     thing. It's been a pleasure. You're obviously a
     man of great integrity, and a dedicated commander,
     and a very skilled pilot.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Teyla exchange amused looks. Ronon rolls
     his eyes.

  ALTERNATE SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Well, that's funny. I was going to
     say the same to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard still looks bemused at the conversation
     he just had with...himself.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The F-302s fly away. Daedalus blinks out of the
     reality.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  MCKAY
     All right, the alien ship's gone. I'm reading a
     planet with no energy signatures. It's the first
     reality we jumped to. One more, and we're home.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla is visibly relieved.

  SHEPPARD
     Let's get down to the hangar bay.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The team head to the hangar bay.

  MCKAY
     All right...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay opens the door to the hangar bay. An alien
     lies in wait on the other side. It fires, striking
     McKay in the right arm.

  MCKAY
     Ah! Ow!

  TEYLA
     Rodney!

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla pushes McKay out of the way as Ronon and
     Sheppard return fire. Teyla protects McKay with
     her own body.

  MCKAY
     (in disbelief) I got shot!

  RONON
     (over the fire) I thought we got 'em all.

  SHEPPARD
     Apparently not!

  ANNOTATION
     He shoots another volley of fire. Ronon fires as
     well, finally downing the alien. Sheppard and
     Ronon approach, still shooting at the body to be
     sure.

  RONON
     Think there's any more of them?

  SHEPPARD
     We're not waiting around to find out.

  ANNOTATION
     The alien's hand falls away from his chest,
     revealing a grenade counting down.

  SHEPPARD
     Move, move move!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Ronon barely get back out the door
     before the grenade goes off. The explosion forces
     an automatic closure of the hangar bay door as
     Ronon and Sheppard skid across the floor. An alarm
     sounds at a panel. The wounded McKay checks it
     out.

  MCKAY
     The explosion's caused a hull breach. Whole
     sections have been depressurized including the
     hangar bay. We just lost the jumpers!

  SHEPPARD
     Our stop is coming up, Rodney. It's time to get
     off this train!

  MCKAY
     (panicked) Look, there's no way off!

  TEYLA
     Once we jump into our own reality, Atlantis will
     detect us, and they will send help.

  MCKAY
     We broke orbit to get away from the fighters,
     remember? Look, we carry our momentum and relative
     position in space from one reality to the next,
     which means, by the time we next jump, we're gonna
     be, like, half a million kilometers out. They're
     never going to get to us in time!

  RONON
     We got C-4. I say we wait 'till we get back, and
     then blow the drive.

  MCKAY
     That could work, or it could tear a hole in the
     space-time continuum, not only killing us, but
     destroying the entire solar system.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we better think of something fast.

  ANNOTATION
     The team exchange worried looks.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  CHUCK
     Another contact just appeared on our screens.

  LORNE
     Was it the Daedalus?

  ZELENKA
     They're too far out for us to get IFF.

  LORNE
     Well, try subspace.

  ANNOTATION
     Chuck presses a few keys, then signals to Lorne.

  LORNE
     (into radio) Colonel Sheppard, do you read...?
     Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne, do you
     read? (to Chuck) Was there a hyperspace window?

  CHUCK
     No, sir. They just appeared out of nowhere.

  LORNE
     Well, it's got to be them. Alert Mister Woolsey.
     (to Zelenka) Doc, you're with me. Come on, let's
     go.

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne and Zelenka hurry away.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper heads towards the Daedalus.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ZELENKA
     All right, we should be within radio range.

  LORNE
     (into radio) Colonel Sheppard, come in.

  ANNOTATION
     A large amount of static is the only response.

  LORNE
     Doctor McKay, this is Major Lorne, do you read?

  ZELENKA
     (shaking his head) There's too much interference.
     I'm picking up some kind of...energy reading. It's
     spiking.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     As the jumper draws closer, Daedalus blinks away.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  LORNE
     What the hell just happened?

  ZELENKA
     They disappeared.

  LORNE
     Wh-what are you talking about?

  ZELENKA
     Well...they-they're just gone.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm beeps.

  ZELENKA
     Oh, wait a minute. I'm picking up four life signs.

  LORNE
     Okay, where?

  ZELENKA
     Dead ahead.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper slowly approaches for small objects in
     the distance.

  LORNE
     (over radio) Colonel Sheppard, is that you?

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Major, nice of you to stop by. Kind
     of hard to get a cab in this neighborhood.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Lorne and Zelenka exchange smiles.

  LORNE
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     As the jumper draws closer, it is clear that the
     four objects are four space suits, each holding a
     member of Sheppard's team.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tries do work while sitting up in his
     hospital bed. Sheppard sits in a visitor chair
     nearby, playing with a handheld computer game.

  SHEPPARD
     How many jumps you think that drive has left in it
     before it burns out?

  MCKAY
     Half a dozen, tops. Then it'll be completely
     inert.

  SHEPPARD
     Good. I hate to think of somebody else getting
     trapped inside that thing like we did.

  MCKAY
     Actually, you know, I've been thinking about that.
     Now, true, the navigation system was flawed to
     start, but, um, the basic principles of the drive
     are fundamentally sound--

  SHEPPARD
     Forget it, Rodney.

  MCKAY
     I've saved the relevant data. Minor adjustments,
     and I should have be able to have this thing up
     and running--

  SHEPPARD
     (insistent) I said, forget it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla approaches, carrying Torren. Sheppard puts
     down his game.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, look who's here.

  TEYLA
     How's your shoulder, Rodney?

  MCKAY
     (surprised) Uh, it's pretty bad, but, you know,
     it's better, thanks.

  TEYLA
     Is it well enough to hold him?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard gives McKay a pointed look.

  MCKAY
     Really?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods. McKay shifts in his bed to a better
     position

  SHEPPARD
     Don't drop him.

  MCKAY
     (sarcastic) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla places the baby in McKay's arms. McKay
     smiles down at it.

  MCKAY
     Hey there, little guy. I think he likes me.

  TEYLA
     It suits you.

  MCKAY
     You think so?

  TEYLA
     I think you'll make an excellent father someday.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks panicked and shoots Sheppard a look.

  MCKAY
     Um...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard rolls his eyes and leaves.

  SHEPPARD
     (as he leaves) I've seen a lot of scary things in
     my time, but, uh, that thought scares me the most.

  MCKAY
     (nervous) Did you want to um,...?

  TEYLA
     I think so.

  MCKAY
     There you go, watch out now, they wiggle...right.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla takes Torren back.
