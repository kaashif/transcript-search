LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A puddle jumper moves deeply under the Atlantis
     Ocean.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, Sheppard's team, and a science team are all
     inside the jumper, looking bored. Teyla moves from
     the cargo area and approaches McKay, who's sitting
     behind Sheppard in the front area.

  TEYLA
     Um, "shotgun," is it?

  MCKAY
     (unhappy) Aw, come on. Don't know why I have to do
     this.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla shoots him an unsympathetic smile as she
     takes his seat. McKay moves to the back and sits
     across from McKay. Zelenka glances at him.

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) What?

  ZELENKA
     Nobody said anything.

  MCKAY
     Well, you don't have to, do you? Look, it's not my
     fault things are hard to find on the bottom of the
     ocean.

  ZELENKA
     Rodney, you said you knew where it was.

  MCKAY
     I said I knew its last known location. It is a
     mobile drilling station, remember? Obviously
     that's going to take a few hours.

  RONON
     If we don't find it soon, this is going to be your
     last known location.

  MCKAY
     (sarcastic) Oh, zing.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, kids, do I have to pull this thing over?
     It's hard enough being in this damn thing for
     hours without listening to you guys.

  GRAYDON
     Actually, Dr. McKay has managed to narrow the
     search field to a remarkably small area.

  MCKAY
     (preening) Mmm. Finally, a voice of reason. Thank
     you, Doctor, um...

  GRAYDON
     Graydon.

  MCKAY
     (absently) Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to
     the team.

  GRAYDON
     (nonplussed) Uh, I've been here almost eight
     months.

  MCKAY
     (surprised) Really?

  GRAYDON
     Yeah.

  MCKAY
     (uncomfortable) Oh. It's been that long, has it?
     Time certainly flies.

  ZELENKA
     Of course, unless you're in a jumper, looking for
     a needle in a haystack.

  MCKAY
     You know what? Shut up.

  RONON
     You know what? You shut up, McKay.

  MCKAY
     Hey! I don't hear Grayson complaining.

  GRAYDON
     Uh, it's Graydon, w-with a "D."

  MCKAY
     What? You sure?

  GRAYDON
     I-it's--it's my name.

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, 'cause I could've sworn that the guy I
     wanted for your department was called Grayson,
     because I remember thinking "Dick Grayson," Bruce
     Wayne's ward.

  GRAYDON
     Well, it's Graydon.

  MCKAY
     Huh. Wonder if that means I hired the wrong guy.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Weir) Well. Still glad you came?

  WEIR
     (drily) Oh. Sorry. I was preoccupied thinking
     about the geothermal drilling platform.

  SHEPPARD
     It shouldn't take us much longer. We just passed a
     thermal layer, and I'm getting some readings a
     couple of hundred feet ahead.

  WEIR
     If we did manage to find an alternate and
     potentially limitless power supply... well, that
     would make even this insufferably long
     search...seem worthwhile.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, kids, we're here.

  ANNOTATION
     He powers up the HUD and the scientists all gather
     around to stare at the display.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, hopefully it won't take too much longer to
     power up this station.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS OCEAN

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper approaches the drilling platform.
     Lights automatically power on as it draws nearer.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  WEIR
     That wasn't so hard.

  SHEPPARD
     All I've got to do is dock this thing, and...we
     can find out what this place is all about.


LOCATION--HIVE SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     A Wraith queen awakens.

  END OF TEASER


  'EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN'


  ANNOTATION
     The jumper has docked inside a port.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Scientists and engineers are scattered throughout
     the station. Weir wanders among them.

  MCKAY
     (to Weir) All systems are online and functioning
     at full capacity.

  WEIR
     You mean we're generating power already?

  MCKAY
     Well, no, but we probably could if we wanted to.

  WEIR
     No, slow down. The Ancients abandoned this project
     for a reason. Let's try to find out what that
     reason might be before we start drilling into the
     planet's crust.

  MCKAY
     Yes, well, fair enough.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla patrol the station.

  TEYLA
     Have we not been down this hallway before?

  RONON
     Every corridor looks the same.

  SHEPPARD
     Don't worry, I have an uncanny sense of direction.

  RONON
     No, I think she's right. We've been down this way
     before.

  SHEPPARD
     That's impossible. We took a left, and a left, and
     then a right.

  RONON
     Hey, look, all I'm saying is--

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla stops abruptly and gasps.

  RONON
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     He and Sheppard turn back.

  TEYLA
     I am sensing a Wraith presence nearby.

  SHEPPARD
     Are you sure? We're...pretty deep underwater.

  TEYLA
     (nervous) I cannot be certain, but I believe it is
     onboard the drilling platform.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) This is Sheppard. Everyone drop what
     you're doing. Get back to the control room
     immediately.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's team has joined Weir and McKay.

  MCKAY
     (patronizing) We did a complete lifesigns scan. It
     was the first thing we did when we stepped aboard
     this station. Look, I promise you, there is nobody
     here but us.

  TEYLA
     No, Rodney. And I am sensing it even closer now.

  MCKAY
     Well, maybe it's the pressure. It's been known to
     do things to the mind.

  SHEPPARD
     Just humor me and check again.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs and works the controls. The life signs
     detector zooms in on only people in the control
     room area.

  MCKAY
     There. All of these lifesigns have been accounted
     for. Humored?

  WEIR
     Wraith don't show up on lifesigns detectors if
     they're hibernating.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay rolls his eyes.

  TEYLA
     I know what I am sensing.

  MCKAY
     There is no Wraith here, I'm telling you!

  RONON
     Has your sense ever been wrong?

  TEYLA
     Never, and I cannot shake this feeling.

  RONON
     I trust her.

  MCKAY
     As opposed to irrefutable fact?

  RONON
     Your machines don't know everything.

  MCKAY
     I never said that they did.

  TEYLA
     There is a way for me to be sure. If I can reach
     out with my mind and establish a link--

  SHEPPARD
     Whoa! That's a little reckless, don't you think?

  TEYLA
     If there is no Wraith, then there will be no mind
     for me to link with and therefore no risk. But if
     there is a Wraith nearby...

  WEIR
     We need to know.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla nods.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla sits on a bench in a crew bunk room,
     meditating. Sheppard, Weir, and Ronon stand
     nearby. Bunks are built into alcoves in the walls.

  TEYLA
     I'm ready.

  SHEPPARD
     You sure?

  TEYLA
     The briefest contact will determine whether or not
     I'm right.

  SHEPPARD
     That's all we need, so don't stick around any
     longer.

  WEIR
     And we will bring you out of it if at the first
     sign of trouble.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla closes her eyes and starts to breathe
     deeply.

  SHEPPARD
     (low, to Ronon) Just to be sure...

  RONON
     It's already set to stun.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla opens her eyes and glares at Sheppard.

  SHEPPARD
     Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla breathes deeply. Her friends watch
     worriedly. Teyla shifts her head as if
     uncomfortable. Her eyes roll back into her head
     before she comes out of it and awakens.

  WEIR
     Teyla?

  ANNOTATION
     They watch her warily.

  TEYLA
     (awkwardly) I was mistaken. There is nothing
     there.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that's good.

  TEYLA
     I'm sorry.

  SHEPPARD
     No reason to be sorry.

  TEYLA
     Perhaps it was the effect of the pressure at this
     depth.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if you've ever seen The Abyss, pressure can
     make you nuts...not that I think you're nuts.

  TEYLA
     It's all right, John. I'm relieved.

  WEIR
     So am I. Well, we have a lot of exploring to do.

  SHEPPARD
     We?

  WEIR
     Until Rodney delivers the preliminary status
     report, I'm all yours. Put me to work, Colonel.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, let's make up some time. Break into
     teams. Uh, Ronon, you're with Teyla. Elizabeth,
     you're with me, or...I'm with you, however you
     want to put it.

  WEIR
     Either way... or "eyether" way...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard takes back h is rifle. Ronon returns
     Teyla's sidearm to her as they split up.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and Weir explore a corridor.

  SHEPPARD
     That was weird.

  WEIR
     (sighing) Well, we are at the very bottom of the
     ocean. Maybe you're right, Teyla's just
     experiencing the effects of the pressure.

  SHEPPARD
     Hopefully not as bad as that guy in The Abyss.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teyla stroll down a different corridor.

  RONON
     This place is big, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla does not respond. Instead, she studies
     everything.

  RONON
     What's wrong?

  TEYLA
     Nothing. Why?

  RONON
     You just haven't said a word.

  TEYLA
     Have I not?

  RONON
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla stops.

  TEYLA
     Has my silence made you...uncomfortable?

  RONON
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla approaches with a small smile.

  TEYLA
     Your friendship is very important to me... I would
     hate to do anything that made you...
     uncomfortable.

  ANNOTATION
     She clasps him on the shoulder.

  RONON
     Okay. Well, I'm good.

  ANNOTATION
     He smiles back at her. Teyla immediately knees him
     in the groin.

  RONON
     Oh!

  ANNOTATION
     Before Ronon can recover, "Teyla" follows through
     on her attack with more punches and kicks. Ronon
     grunts in pain before collapsing to the ground.
     "Teyla" continues to kick Ronon. Once he is
     unconscious, she looks around. Seeing and hearing
     nothing, she continues on with purpose.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     "Teyla" spots a computer terminal. She starts
     working the controls.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The power shuts down.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Rodney? What's going on?


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay strolls through the room, unconcerned. Power
     is still on in his area.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) What do you mean, what's going on?

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) We just lost the lights.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) What?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay moves a scientist out of the way and checks
     his laptop, attached to an Ancient terminal.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Huh. You're right.

  WEIR
     (over radio, sarcastic) Yes, we can see that.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) We just lost power to forty percent
     of the station. Sensors are currently off-line.
     Zelenka, what're you doing?


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka studies a terminal with his own computer.
     He too has power.

  ZELENKA
     (into radio) Uh, what do you mean, what am I
     doing?

  MCKAY
     Have you lost power where you are?

  ZELENKA
     (into radio) No, have you?


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (into radio) No.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) We have.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) I want to know what's going on.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) You know, this station has been lying
     idle down here for a few millennia. We're bound to
     blow a few fuses.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (continuing into radio) Look, I'll have power back
     online in a minute. Just hang tight.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts working on his computer, zeroing in on
     the affected areas.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Ronon, Teyla, report your position.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     In another corridor, Ronon lies unconscious.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Ronon? Teyla? Come in.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Sheppard exchange concerned looks.


LOCATION--AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla continues to frantically work the controls.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Ronon? Teyla?

  ANNOTATION
     She ignores the radio.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Rodney, we've lost contact with Ronon
     and Teyla. Do you know their position?


LOCATION--AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL, ZELENKA'S POSITION

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka looks up, concerned, as he listens to the
     radio exchange.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) No, negative. Internal sensors are
     out, but I have determined the location where the
     power went down.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (into radio) It's an auxiliary control area,
     search grid six.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION

  MCKAY
     (over radio) It's the deck that Ronon and Teyla
     were exploring.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) We'll meet you there.

  ANNOTATION
     He and Weir rush off.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Okay. (to Dickenson) Davidson.

  DICKENSON
     (standing) It's, uh, Dickenson, sir.

  MCKAY
     (impatiently) Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark.
     Just give me a break here. Look, get back to the
     jumper, see if you can use its sensors to
     determine the location of our people within the
     drilling platform.

  DICKENSON
     Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Graydon walks by.

  MCKAY
     Graydon, you go with him.

  ANNOTATION
     Dickenson and Graydon exchange looks, but comply.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM, ATLANTIS OCEAN

  ANNOTATION
     The Wraith queen swims towards the platform.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay nervously walks down a corridor. He hears a
     noise and spins around, only to find Sheppard and
     Weir there. He sighs in relief.

  MCKAY
     There you are.

  ANNOTATION
     The three of them continue down the corridor with
     their flashlights.


LOCATION--AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL, TEYLA'S LOCATION

  ANNOTATION
     "Teyla" stares at the display screen. She pushes a
     button that opens an a crystal access area.
     Unholstering her sidearm, she shoots the panel,
     destroying the crystals.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The gunfire can be heard in the distance.

  WEIR
     Weapons fire.

  SHEPPARD
     Nine mil. This way.

  ANNOTATION
     He and Weir rush in that direction. McKay hangs
     back, shaking his head.

  MCKAY
     Oh, yes, let's race towards the gunfire.

  ANNOTATION
     He follows.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM ACCESS POOL

  ANNOTATION
     In the center of a room sits a round pool. The
     Wraith queen emerges from its depths, breathing
     deeply and looking around.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Ronon, Teyla, come in.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Weir, and McKay cautiously patrol the
     darkened corridor. Off in a side corridor, Ronon
     coughs. The trio instantly rush to his side,
     helping him sit up.

  WEIR
     Are you all right?

  RONON
     (groaning) No.

  WEIR
     Did you see who attacked you?

  RONON
     Yeah, it was Teyla.

  MCKAY
     (shocked) What? W-Why?

  WEIR
     Okay, until we what's going on, I'd like everyone
     in one place.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, TEYLA'S POSITION

  ANNOTATION
     She pulls up schematics of the station, studying
     them.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Various corridors, including the one with
     Dickenson and Graydon, have force fields
     activating in various sections.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR, SHEPPARD'S TEAM'S POSITION

  ZELENKA
     (over radio) This is Zelenka. Someone has just
     activated emergency force fields throughout the
     station.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Can you make it back to the control
     room?

  ZELENKA
     (over radio) Yes, I think so.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Do it.

  MCKAY
     Well, that doesn't make any sense. What's she
     doing?

  SHEPPARD
     You and Elizabeth go back to the control room.
     Ronon and I are going to check up on Teyla.

  WEIR
     Be careful.

  RONON
     No kidding.

  ANNOTATION
     They part ways.


LOCATION--AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, TEYLA'S POSITION

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla gasps and half collapses onto the terminal.
     Catching herself, she looks around the room,
     confused and panicked. She sees her sidearm lying
     on the terminal and grabs it, holding it while
     looking around in wonder and trying to catch her
     breath. Her back is to the door. She senses
     something behind her and spins around, her pistol
     at ready. Sheppard stands there, pointing his own
     pistol at her.

  SHEPPARD
     Drop it.

  ANNOTATION
     She gasps in shock and drops the pistol.

  TEYLA
     (in shock) John...

  ANNOTATION
     Unable to stand any longer, she collapses onto the
     terminal.

  SHEPPARD
     What the hell's going on?

  TEYLA
     (bemused) I do not know.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and McKay stand by a computer.

  WEIR
     Rodney, what's the status?

  MCKAY
     As far from the "quo" as it gets. Look, Teyla
     didn't just shut down several key systems. She
     scrambled the existing operating codes.

  ZELENKA
     This is going to take a while.

  WEIR
     Can we contact Atlantis?

  MCKAY
     The station's communication system is just gone. I
     can't even patch it. She's blown the control
     crystals, and shut down half the power to the
     station, and set up a series of emergency force
     fields.

  WEIR
     To what purpose?

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) This is Sheppard. We got Teyla.

  WEIR
     (into radio) And...?


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla walk down a corridor.
     Teyla hugs herself and looks upset. Ronon and
     Sheppard watch her--both concerned and wary.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) And nothing. She has no memory of
     anything that happened in the last hour. We're on
     our way to crew quarters.

  WEIR
     (over radio) I'll meet you there.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM

  WEIR
     (to McKay) Okay, let's forget about restoring this
     station to its former glory. Concentrate your
     efforts on internal sensors and disabling the
     force fields that are cutting us off from the
     jumper.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Weir joins the trio in the room.

  TEYLA
     Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.

  WEIR
     Don't worry about that. How are you feeling now?

  TEYLA
     I am fine. But to hear of the damage I caused, and
     yet to have no memory of my actions...

  ANNOTATION
     She sighs.

  WEIR
     Just tell us what you do remember.

  TEYLA
     I was attempting to seek out the Wraith presence
     with my mind, and then...

  ANNOTATION
     She looks confused.

  WEIR
     (stunned) There is a Wraith?

  TEYLA
     The most powerful mind I have ever encountered. I
     tried to shut her out, but--

  SHEPPARD
     (interrupting) Her?

  TEYLA
     Yes. I believe this Wraith is a queen.

  SHEPPARD
     (making a face) I hate queens.

  TEYLA
     In that brief moment, I sensed...great power--the
     experiences of many centuries...hunger. And
     then...nothing. My next memory is of Colonel
     Sheppard and Ronon aiming their weapons towards
     me.

  WEIR
     So there is a Wraith aboard the drilling platform.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if that were the case, why'd she use Teyla
     to do all that damage, and why didn't the
     lifesigns detector pick up a signal?

  RONON
     It doesn't matter. If she's here, I'll find her.

  SHEPPARD
     We'll find her.

  TEYLA
     I would like to help.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir exchanges looks with the others.

  WEIR
     I'm sorry, Teyla, but until we can determine
     exactly what's--

  TEYLA
     (interrupting, frustrated) Yes. Of course. I
     understand.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Dickenson and Graydon crouch by a panel, opening
     the crystal bay.

  MCKAY
     (over radio) Dickenson. Any progress on disabling
     those force fields? I'm getting indications that
     some of them are going up and down, and we could
     really use the jumper's sensors.

  DICKENSON
     (into radio) I-I'm doing my best, sir.

  GRAYDON
     One of these days, I'm just going to call him "Dr.
     McCoy."

  DICKENSON
     I'd love to be there for that.

  GRAYDON
     Well, the next time he calls me Grayson--

  DICKENSON
     Actually, I know a Grayson.

  GRAYDON
     There really is a Grayson?

  DICKENSON
     Yeah, he's a damn good scientist, too. I'm
     surprised McKay didn't hire him.

  ANNOTATION
     In the distance, they hear a force field
     deactivating.

  GRAYDON
     Did you do that?

  DICKENSON
     I don't know, but I'm happy to take credit for it.
     Check it out.

  GRAYDON
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves Dickenson to continue working on the
     panel and heads down the hall. Around the corner,
     he notices puddle of water on the floor. He
     continues to the jumper. He sees another puddle on
     the lowered door. He looks around, but the
     corridor is empty. He turns to enter the jumper,
     only to come face to face with the hissing queen.

  ZELENKA
     I don't understand. Wh-what could the Wraith
     possibly want with an Ancient drilling platform?
     For that matter, how did they even get here?

  MCKAY
     (annoyed) I don't know, maybe on a ship nearby.

  ZELENKA
     Under water?

  MCKAY
     Look, who knows? Teyla's Spidey sense works for
     miles. Look, are the external sensors up and
     running?

  ZELENKA
     Yes, they're operational, but they're designed to
     scan the ocean floor.

  MCKAY
     It doesn't matter. Coleman, take a look at the
     drilling platform's external sensors. See what you
     turn up.

  COLEMAN
     Well, what am I looking for?

  MCKAY
     Anything.

     Weir paces the room while Teyla sits on a bunk.
     Ronon and Sheppard are gone.

  WEIR
     How are you feeling?

  TEYLA
     I've never been more ashamed.

  WEIR
     Oh, you can't blame yourself.

  TEYLA
     I should have been more careful.

  WEIR
     A Wraith queen's mind is extremely powerful,
     Teyla. You know that better than I do.

  TEYLA
     Still...if my actions while under her control
     result in people getting hurt...

  ANNOTATION
     She shakes her head.

  WEIR
     If you hadn't done what you did...who knows what
     could've happened? At least now we know what we're
     dealing with. If anything, I should thank you. I
     certainly don't blame you.

  TEYLA
     I would like to help them find her.

  WEIR
     Teyla...

  TEYLA
     There is no risk.

  WEIR
     I don't know that.

  TEYLA
     (studying Weir) Unless you suspect I am still
     under her control even now?

  WEIR
     Would I be alone with you if I did?

  TEYLA
     Then you think I am...somehow vulnerable to her?

  WEIR
     I think it is best to keep you away from her for
     the moment, yes. Look, I don't fully understand
     this capability you have of linking with a Wraith
     mind, but if it's even remotely possible that--

  TEYLA
     She was only able to control me because I opened
     my mind to her. If I choose to do so again, I will
     be ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla stands.

  WEIR
     Teyla, I know you want to help...

  TEYLA
     I do.

  WEIR
     The best way for you to do that is allow Ronon and
     Colonel Sheppard to find her.

  TEYLA
     (sighing) As you wish.

     beginning to think you had gotten lost. Listen,
     did you manage to, uh--

  ANNOTATION
     He turns around to see the queen standing there,
     snarling at him. Dickenson, panicked, clambers to
     his feet and runs down the hall. He slams into the
     force field and falls onto his back. Sliding
     panicked against the wall, he tries to back away
     from the queen, who stalks towards him.

  DICKENSON
     Oh God! Oh! (into radio) Colonel Sheppard! Oh-- if
     you can hear me......please--

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard senses someone behind him. He spins,
     raising his weapon to find the queen standing in
     the back of the jumper. She hisses. He tries to
     fire, but her mind control paralyzes him. He
     groans in resistance, but cannot stop his hands
     from dropping his weapon, letting it fall against
     his chest, still held by the strap.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     You are Sheppard. The one who can fly this ship.
     You will return me to the surface. Kneel.

  ANNOTATION

     Sheppard shakes, trying to resist. Ronon appears
     in the doorway, pistol aimed. Sheppard notices
     him. The queen sees Sheppard's diverted attention
     and spins as Ronon fires. His blast shatters the
     window to the jumper, which is immersed in the
     ocean. Water pours into the jumper, washing out
     Sheppard and the queen.

     The conversation switches between that location
     and the control room.

  SHEPPARD
     I noticed.

  MCKAY
     You were thrown by the force of the water clear of
     the force field bulkhead.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard spots Ronon lying nearby.

  SHEPPARD
     Ronon?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon groans and stands. He walks over to the
     forcefield and touches it. The other side of the
     corridor is completely filled with water.

  RONON
     I missed.

  SHEPPARD
     I noticed that, too.

  MCKAY
     Everyone else is accounted for. Any sign of
     Dickenson?

     corridor.

  MCKAY
     Look, I don't know what just happened, but we are
     now cut off from the jumper.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon aims his gun at point blank range from the
     Wraith queen.

  RONON
     I won't miss now.

  SHEPPARD
     Wait.

  RONON
     What for?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we lost the jumper and we lost
     communications with Atlantis. Maybe she can help
     us get out of this place.

  WEIR
     Welcome back. I trust you're comfortable?

  SHEPPARD
     That groggy sensation you're feeling are the
     sedatives we're pumping you full of. Just a
     precaution. As for the other precautions...

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon sneers as he flourishes his weapon, changing
     the setting.

  WEIR
     Now, you're going to tell us everything we want to
     know.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     In exchange for?

  WEIR
     (firm) This is not a negotiation.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     I disagree.

  RONON
     Let me get this over with.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon aims his gun. The queen sits up, hissing and
     pulling against the restraints. Ronon shoves her
     back down as Weir backs up. They all take a
     moment.

  WEIR
     How did you get aboard this station? Are there any
     more of you?

  ANNOTATION

  ZELENKA
     We should be able to keep the force fields up
     until Atlantis sends a rescue jumper, but station
     communications are still down, so...

  MCKAY
     I should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't
     have happened.

  ZELENKA
     Don't worry about it, Rodney, it's not your fault.

  MCKAY
     I'm the one who sent those men back to the jumper.

  ZELENKA
     Well, the sensors indicated that there was nobody
     here, so...

  COLEMAN
     I don't think there was, sir. I think the Wraith
     arrived here after we did the initial scans.

  MCKAY
     What?

  COLEMAN
     Well, you asked me to do a search with the remote
     sensors. I found something. We didn't notice it on
     the way down because it's radiating very little
     E.M.

  ANNOTATION
     She brings up a display on the monitor.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) Guys, head back here. I think I have
     a few answers.

     Later, Sheppard and Weir have joined the others.

  SHEPPARD
     A Wraith cruiser?

  MCKAY
     It seems completely buried in silt.

  ZELENKA
     Which means it's been here a very, very, very long
     time.

  MCKAY
     Yes, give or take a "very."

  SHEPPARD
     That doesn't explain how she got here.

  WEIR
     Maybe she swam over.

  SHEPPARD
     No, no. The pressure at that depth is--

  MCKAY
     (interrupting) Is deadly to humans, but she's not
     human, remember?

     talking. Other than: "You're all about to die."

  WEIR
     Which may or may not be an empty threat.

  TEYLA
     And you have no way of knowing?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, she said it with a lot of confidence.

  TEYLA
     There is a way to find out.

  SHEPPARD
     We've already been down that road.

  WEIR
     And what is to stop her asserting control over you
     again?

     It does not matter.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we think it does.

  WRAITH QUEEN

  TEYLA
     (continuing) Queen of a great alliance. Her ship
     was damaged during the battle. It crashed into the

  WEIR
     She's resting. I think it took a lot more out of
     her than she's willing to admit.

  SHEPPARD
     What's the news?

  MCKAY
     Okay, well, it looks like the Ancients chose this
     section of the ocean floor because the planet's
     crust is remarkably thin right below us, allowing
     them to drill directly into the magma and maximize
     the geothermal power output.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay.

  ZELENKA
     Which means there's a great deal of potential
     energy directly beneath this station.

  SHEPPARD
     That's the news? That this place works as
     advertised?

  MCKAY
     No, no, the news is that if they were to detonate,
     say, the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser on just
     such a wafer-thin crust--

  WEIR
     (realizing) Oh my God.

  ZELENKA
     All that thermal energy directly beneath us will
     be released all at once.

  SHEPPARD
     So...bad news.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, the initial explosion will be magnified a
     thousand times. We're talking catastrophic.

  SHEPPARD
     So it won't just be us that's affected.

  ZELENKA
     No, Atlantis will be affected as well. It's well
     within the blast radius.

  WEIR
     And we have no way to warn them?

  MCKAY
     They'd never even see it coming.

  SHEPPARD
     So we, uh, disarm the self-destruct.

  MCKAY
     That's brilliant, but we still need to get there.

  WEIR
     And how do we do that without the jumper?

  SHEPPARD
     We're way behind schedule. Uh, they're going to
     send a rescue jumper any minute now.

  MCKAY
     Even if they've left already, I mean, the moment
     we were overdue...

  ZELENKA
     Yeah, they won't make it in time.

  SHEPPARD
     How far is the cruiser?

  ZELENKA
     Um... Less than a kilometer.

  ANNOTATION
     They look at the display.

     here. They were used primarily to make repairs to
     the exterior of the station.

  SHEPPARD
     Very cool.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, you should be able to traverse the distance
     between here and the, uh, cruiser.

  SHEPPARD
     You mean "we."

  MCKAY
     Uh, yes, of course. We.

  MCKAY
     Forgive me for being aware of exactly how much
     pressure is being exerted on this suit right now.

  SHEPPARD
     Just think of it as a walk on the beach...a beach
     that's about to explode.

  MCKAY
     That's supposed to make me feel better?

  SHEPPARD
     No, it's supposed to make you walk faster. We're
     on the clock here.

  WEIR
     (over radio) This is Weir. How close are you?

     self-destruct in time anyway, so we're really not
     in a rush.

  SHEPPARD
     Why don't we find it first, and then you can be
     negative?

  MCKAY
     You know, this ship is remarkably preserved.

  SHEPPARD
     You'd think after 10,000 years, she'd want to
     redecorate.

     just lost their main drive.

  SHEPPARD
     You're saying this thing is salvageable?

  MCKAY
     Well, I'd have to assess damage to the primary
     systems, but it's not completely out of the
     question. Of course, you'd probably just go and
     blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or
     something, and all that work would be for nothing.

  SHEPPARD
     Tick, tick, tick...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay checks his sensor.

  MCKAY
     This way.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla continues to breathe deeply. Suddenly, she
     gasps.

  WEIR
     Teyla?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla throws her head back with a cry and clutches
     her head.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     You are weakening.

  WEIR
     Teyla, I think you should stop.

  TEYLA
     My concentration slipped for just a moment.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     And in that moment, I could have crushed you with
     a single thought. Perhaps next time, I will.

  WEIR
     There isn't going to be a next time.

  TEYLA
     Elizabeth, I am fine.

  WEIR
     No, you're not. I can see what this is doing to
     you. Let's just give McKay a chance.


LOCATION--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     The alarm pulses.

  SHEPPARD
     There it is.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     Well, I'm pretty sure this is the device, and I'm
     pretty sure it says we have less than half an
     hour.

  SHEPPARD
     So, turn it off.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay tries to work some controls.

  MCKAY
     (puzzled) Hmm.

  SHEPPARD
     What does that mean?

  MCKAY
     It's not accepting commands of any kind. There
     must be some kind of a-a command code that needs
     to be entered first.

  SHEPPARD
     Can you figure it out?

  MCKAY
     (sarcastic) Yes, well, command codes are usually
     quite simple, like the number "one" or the letter
     "A," like, in Wraith, which would be, um--

  SHEPPARD
     (interrupting) Can you figure out the code or not?

  MCKAY
     No! Not if I stood here and tried for a million
     years, and we have, uh, (checking his watch)
     ...just under a million years less than that.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Elizabeth, you there?

  WEIR
     (into radio) Any luck?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Negative. We don't get her command
     code in less than 30 minutes, we're dead.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Still strapped to the gurney, the queen overhears
     Weir and Teyla speaking in the hall.

  TEYLA
     This is the only way.

  WEIR
     I told you, Rodney has another idea.

  TEYLA
     That may or may not succeed. There is only one way
     to be certain.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  WEIR
     She said she would kill you next time.

  TEYLA
     I will not let that happen.

  WEIR
     No. We're going to give them more time.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir leaves. Teyla watches her go with a cunning
     expression, then turns back to reenter the room
     where they're holding the queen.


LOCATION--DRILLING STATION CHAMBER

  TEYLA
     Ronon. There's been an emergency in the control
     room. Dr. Weir needs your help.

  RONON
     (indicating the queen) What about her?

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla unholsters her sidearm.

  TEYLA
     I will watch the prisoner. Hurry.

  RONON
     Watch yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves. Teyla lowers her gun.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     Are you fool enough to try again?

  TEYLA
     I have very little to lose.

  ANNOTATION
     The queen sneers as Teyla goes into a meditative
     trance. The queen gasps, trying to resist.
     Suddenly Teyla gasps and her eyes open. The queen
     opens her eyes and watches Teyla. Teyla blankly
     and turns to the bindings and undoes the straps
     holding the queen down. Once free, the queen
     raises her feeding arm to strike, then pauses, her
     eyes widening.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     You are trying to hide something from me.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla stares in fear and shock at the queen,
     breathing hard.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Weir and Sheppard approach Teyla.

  WEIR
     There's been a development.

  TEYLA
     You've been able to disarm the self-destruct
     device?

  SHEPPARD
     No, but, uh, Rodney thinks if he can tie in a
     naquadah generator, he can still get the Wraith
     cruiser to fly.

  TEYLA
     After all these years?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, the damage was superficial. The problem was
     the engines. McKay's already restored power, and I
     think...I can fly the ship to a safe distance.

  TEYLA
     That's a suicide mission.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if I can ditch the ship on the mainland,
     maybe I can get far enough away from the
     explosion. I've got to go now.

  TEYLA
     Wait! Let me try again. If I can get her to give
     up her command code, you won't have to risk it.

  SHEPPARD
     You're in no condition to do that. Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  ANNOTATION
     The queen smiles, releasing her mental hold on
     Teyla, who faints. The queen strides down the hall


LOCATION--ATLANTIS OCEAN

  ANNOTATION
     The queen swims from the drilling platform back to
     her ship.


LOCATION--HIVE SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stands by the self-destruct console.
     Hearing something behind him, he turns. The queen
     stalks towards him.

  SHEPPARD
     Well. You're a hell of a swimmer, I'll give you
     that.

  ANNOTATION
     He backs away from the self-destruct nervously as
     the queen approaches.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     You have restored power?

  SHEPPARD
     (casually) It'll fly.

  ANNOTATION
     The queen reaches the controls and types in the
     code for the self-destruct abort. It shuts down.

  WRAITH QUEEN
     You shall be rewarded...with a quick death!

  ANNOTATION
     She is shot from behind by McKay, who fires his
     P-90 at the automatic setting. The queen stays
     standing and turns, stalking angrily towards
     McKay.

  MCKAY
     (panicking) She's not dying according to plan
     here!

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to get away. Sheppard pulls his hidden
     pistol out and shoots the queen in the back
     several times. She finally falls.

  SHEPPARD
     I thought you'd forgotten about me.

  MCKAY
     Of course not. I just had to wait for her to
     disable the device. Hey, just be thankful she
     didn't feed on you before she entered the command
     code.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, that's why you didn't want to be bait.

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, no, you had to be bait, because she
     was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the
     ship.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard seems to consider this logic while McKay
     nervously studies the queen.

  MCKAY
     She is dead, right?

  SHEPPARD
     Let's get out of here.


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM


LOCATION--DRILLING PLATFORM CREW QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Weir sit on a bunk. Sheppard heads to a
     different one and sits down.

  SHEPPARD
     How are you feeling?

  TEYLA
     Oh, much better, now that I no longer feel the
     constant presence of a Wraith.

  SHEPPARD
     That was no ordinary Wraith. It took a lot of
     bullets to take her down.

  RONON
     I wish I was there.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon unbuckles his gun holster and gets into
     another bunk.

  WEIR
     He's right, you know. I mean, deceiving a Wraith
     queen? That's no small feat.

  TEYLA
     (humble) Well, when there are so many lives at
     stake, it's easy to summon the strength.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay enters.

  MCKAY
     (pleased) Well, Zelenka's finally got
     communications back up. Turns out Atlantis had
     sent another jumper. It should be here within the
     hour.

  WEIR
     That's good news.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  RONON
     Yeah, no kidding. I can't wait to see the sun.

  ANNOTATION
     He settles face down on his bunk.

  MCKAY
     What? No, no, no. We haven't finished what we came
     here for. Look, Wraith's gone. We've got a ton of
     research to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir grabs her jacket and stands.

  WEIR
     Yes, we do.

  MCKAY
     In fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come
     up with a way to get auxiliary power online in a
     couple of days.

  ANNOTATION
     He and Weir leave, Weir throwing a sidelong glance
     back at Teyla, who smiles.

  RONON
     Is he serious?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, he is.

  TEYLA
     Well, I for one intend to spend the next little
     while...resting.

  ANNOTATION
     She fluffs a pillow.

  RONON
     Same here.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Same here. Oh...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard lies down.
