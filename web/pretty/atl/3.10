The Return Part 1
TEASER

LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus moves through hyperspace.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands in front of video monitor with a
     notepad computer and conducts a briefing for
     Deadalus crew.

  MCKAY
     So, I'm in Atlantis, and I need to get to Earth.
     What do I do? Since we no longer have access to a
     ZPM due to...unforeseeable circumstances, my only
     option would be to call the Daedalus and spend the
     next three weeks twiddling my thumbs waiting to
     get back home...until now. I give you the
     McKay-Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge.
     Thirty-four gates from both the Milky Way and
     Pegasus gate systems have been strategically
     placed in the massive void between our two
     galaxies. Simply enter on either side--for
     example, Atlantis--and boom! A macro that, uh, I
     have written especially for the occasion will
     command each Gate in the chain to store you in its
     buffer and forward you along to the next and the
     next, and the next, and the next, and the next,
     until you arrive...here.

  ANNOTATION
     As McKay speaks, the video monitor gives a graphic
     depiction of the McKay/Carter Intergalactic Gate
     Bridge.

  MCKAY
     (continuing) Once at the mid-way space station,
     you simply exit the Pegasus gate system, and enter
     the Milky Way gate system, where a similar macro,
     designed by yours truly, will forward you along to
     the SGC. Total travel time, a little over thirty
     minutes. Cue applause.

  ANNOTATION
     The crew applauds.

  MCKAY
     (signaling) Thank you. Enough.

  ANNOTATION
     The crew stops clapping.

  MCKAY
     The mid-way space station isn't completed yet, so
     we will be testing the system today using a puddle
     jumper. Now the...

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell enters the bridge and interrupts McKay
     while striding to his command chair.

  CALDWELL
     Okay. Show and tell's over. The test is about to
     begin. Let's get back to our stations, please.

  ANNOTATION
     The crew moves back to their bridge stations.

  MCKAY
     Right.


LOCATION--SPACE, MID-WAY SPACE STATION

  ANNOTATION
     The Daedalus drops out of hyperspace near the
     partially constructed space station. It is a
     cylinder shaped truss device; each end of the
     cylinder brackets around a Stargate, one facing
     the Pegasus Galaxy, the other, the Milky Way
     Galaxy.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  MCKAY
     (reading his notepad computer) All systems seem to
     be...huh.

  CALDWELL
     What?

  MCKAY
     (distractedly) Oh, there's an odd echo on the
     proximity sensors. It won't affect the test, but,
     uh...Yeah, we're-we're ready to go.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A puddle jumper lowers from the bay into the Gate
     room. The Stargate is already active.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) The gate is dialed. The forwarding
     macro's been uploaded.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir watches from the balcony.

  WEIR
     (into wireless) All right, John. You have a go.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is alone in the ship.

  SHEPPARD
     All right then, here goes.

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper disappears into the event
     horizon.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT


  ANNOTATION
     There are intermittent flashes of orange light
     during the extended wormhole passage.


LOCATION--SPACE, MID-WAY SPACE STATION

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's puddle jumper exits the active Pegasus
     Stargate and brakes to a stop within the cylinder.
     The Daedalus hovers overhead.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  MCKAY
     We have a contact!

  CALDWELL
     (keying radio) Colonel Sheppard, right on time.
     What's your status?


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) It felt a little weird, but
     everything seems to be in one piece.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Ready to proceed to next phase.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     Uploading macro and initiating dialing sequence.

  ANNOTATION
     He dials the Stargate, which activates.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  MCKAY
     No, no, no, no, no, no. This is weird.

  CALDWELL
     Shall I tell him to stand down?

  MCKAY
     No, no, no. It's, uh, nothing to do with the, uh,
     the test. It's just our, uh, sensors are not
     working properly.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     (slightly impatient) Daedalus, ready to proceed.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  CALDWELL
     Do I clear him?

  MCKAY
     (distracted) Mm. Mm. Yeah-yeah-yeah. I'm sure he's
     fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell continues to watch McKay at the offhand
     response. McKay looks up from his computer and
     notices Caldwell's stare.

  MCKAY
     (more focused) Uh, he's good to go. Good to go.
     Yes. Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell relaxes back into his chair and nods to
     the helmsman.

  CALDWELL
     (into comm) Colonel Sheppard, you have a go.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard takes a deep breath and powers up the
     jumper's thrusters.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay leans in to study the helmsman's monitors.

  MCKAY
     Jumper is away.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay goes back to studying his computer.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman is at his station. Landry stands behind
     him watching the Stargate. O'Neill, dressed in
     Class A uniform walks up and stands next to
     Landry.

  O'NEILL
     He's late.

  LANDRY
     When travelling almost three million light years,
     I'm not so sure there's such a thing as "late".

  O'NEILL
     Right. Yes.

  LANDRY
     You're just mad you didn't get to fly the maiden
     voyage yourself.

  O'NEILL
     Well, General, I am quite fond of both maidens and
     voyages. I mean, put the two together, and...

  LANDRY
     (interrupting) You're not a test pilot anymore,
     Jack.

  O'NEILL
     That's what the President said.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry chuckles as the Stargate activates.

  HARRIMAN
     Incoming wormhole.

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper flies through the active
     Stargate and brakes to a stop right in front of
     the control room window. Sheppard is clearly
     visible in the cockpit, eye to eye with the
     generals.

  O'NEILL
     (leaning into microphone) It's about time!

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Sorry, sir.

  LANDRY
     (into microphone) Colonel Sheppard, welcome to
     Earth.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Thank you, sir. Good to be back.

  LANDRY
     (over radio) You know where to park.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  LANDRY
     (continuing) We'll debrief and go over the flight
     data as soon as you're ready.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper hovers further upward into the
     silo, disappearing out of sight. Landry and
     O'Neill walk away.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  HELMSMAN
     Colonel, we're receiving a databurst. Jumper Three
     has arrived at Stargate Command.

  CALDWELL
     Mission accomplished.

  MCKAY
     (still studying his computer) Yes, of course it
     worked. I'm already onto the next problem.

  CALDWELL
     Which is...?

  MCKAY
     Well, the, uh sensors are having a hard time
     determining what it is. Probably due to the
     Doppler effect.

  CALDWELL
     (pressing) What "what" is?

  MCKAY
     I'm detecting a foreign object travelling at .999
     the speed of light, and it's coming this way.


LOCATION--SPACE, MID-WAY SPACE STATION

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard's puddle jumper exits the Milky Way
     Galaxy Stargate and stops inside the space
     station. Daedalus still hovers nearby.

  HELMSMAN
     We have a contact, sir! It's Colonel Sheppard back
     from Earth.

  CALDWELL
     (into comm) Colonel Sheppard, welcome back to the
     middle of nowhere.

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) Thank you, Colonel.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     (continuing into radio) I've got, uh, takeout
     pizza for everyone back in Atlantis...


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  SHEPPARD
     (over radio) With your permission, I'd like to,
     uh, upload the macro and dial out before it gets
     cold.

  CALDWELL
     Negative. We're putting that leg of the trip on
     hold for now. Seems like we're expecting company.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The Daedalus floats in space.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     McKay paces around the room. Caldwell sits at the
     head of the table. Sheppard sits next to him. The
     rest of the room is filled with sitting and
     standing crew members.

  MCKAY
     Believe it or not, moving that fast, while an
     incredible feat of technology, isn't very useful.
     Certainly in comparison to travel through
     hyperspace. Now, moving as fast as it is, this
     ship--assuming it is a ship--would still take at
     least a million years just to reach the Milky Way.

  CALDWELL
     That close to the speed of light, don't you have
     to take relativity into account?

  MCKAY
     Exactly. The people on board--assuming that they
     are people--would only experience, maybe...twelve
     years? So a few stasis chambers, they're
     laughing...well, they're not laughing, they're
     unconscious, but you know, metaphorically...

  SHEPPARD
     So, assuming it's a ship and assuming they're
     people...

  CALDWELL
     What do we do about them?

  MCKAY
     Ah, well, we try and make contact, obviously.

  CALDWELL
     How do you propose we do that?

  SHEPPARD
     Pull up, honk the horn, try to get them to roll
     down their window.

  CALDWELL
     I'm talking about attempting to match their speed.
     This ship is not designed to do that.

  MCKAY
     Well we can't. I mean even if we succeeded, we'd
     be subject to the same time dilation effects. We'd
     be out of contact with Earth and Atlantis for,
     what, years.

  SHEPPARD
     Can't we overtake them with our hyperdrive?

  MCKAY
     Yes, but they would blow right past us as soon as
     we dropped back into normal space, because our
     "sublight" engines aren't capable of accelerating
     to anywhere near the speed of light.

  SHEPPARD
     So uh, we max out the sublight engines. Get as
     close as we can get.

  MCKAY
     Hmm. Yes. I mean, that-that might work. Um, we
     should at least be able to stay in range enough to
     get some sensor readings. Yeah.

  CALDWELL
     Do it. I'll let Atlantis know you're going to be
     late.

  ANNOTATION
     Caldwell rises and leaves, signalling the
     dismissal of everyone. McKay stops Sheppard from
     exiting.

  MCKAY
     Um, did you really get pizza for everyone? Because
     it would be a shame for that to go to waste if
     we're really gonna um...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stares at McKay.

  MCKAY
     (abashed) Yeah, okay, so solve this first, and
     then...


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Daedalus moves at sublight speeds.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Crew man their stations, including Caldwell in the
     commander's chair. Sheppard and McKay hover near
     the port station.

  HELMSMAN
     Sir, we've got just about everything we're gonna
     get out of sublight engines.

  MCKAY
     They're gonna fly by us in three...two...one...


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A ship, moving so fast it's practically a blur of
     light zooms by the much slower moving Daedalus.


LOCATION--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

  MCKAY
     Interesting.

  CALDWELL
     What?

  MCKAY
     If these readings are correct, and, to be
     perfectly fair they may not be...

  SHEPPARD
     Rodney...

  MCKAY
     It's an Ancient warship. It's possibly Aurora
     class.

  CALDWELL
     Who's flying it?

  MCKAY
     I would imagine Ancients?

  CALDWELL
     There hasn't been any of them around for over ten
     thousand years.

  MCKAY
     (disgusted) Relativity! Look, remember, for them
     only handful of years have passed.

  SHEPPARD
     Don't those ships have hyperdrives?

  MCKAY
     Well, maybe their hyperdrive was damaged in the
     battle with the Wraith. It happens with us all the
     time. I mean, it, uh, it conked out on the way,
     and they were forced to continue at as close to
     light speed as possible. That would explain how
     they got a million light years away from Pegasus
     without having to leave a million years ago.

  CALDWELL
     You know their subspace drive specs better than I
     do, Doctor, but I'm not sure an Aurora-class ship
     has the power to do what you're suggesting.

  MCKAY
     Well, maybe they have a ZPM.

  SHEPPARD
     That would be worth finding out.

  MCKAY
     Okay, we need to send them a message before they
     get out of range, and we have to jump ahead.
     Something like, uh, you know, we are humans from
     Earth, currently occupying Atlantis, yadda yadda
     yadda.

  SHEPPARD
     Why don't we just ask them to slow down.

  ANNOTATION
     A sensor on the starboard station beeps.

  HELMSMAN
     Colonel Caldwell, the unidentified vessel is
     slowing down.

  SHEPPARD
     (offhand) Maybe they heard me.

  MCKAY
     (leaning in to read the monitors) No, they saw us.
     And they're not just slowing down. I mean, they're
     slamming on the brakes at something like
     twenty-seven Gs.

  CALDWELL
     So now what?

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram of a woman in Ancient clothing appears
     on the bridge.

  HELIA
     (via hologram) Unknown vessel, I am Captain Helia
     of the Lantian warship Tria. Our ship has suffered
     damage. We've scanned your vessel and determined
     that it is capable of hyperspace travel. We've
     begun deceleration maneuvers. Will you render
     assistance in the form of hyperspace transport?

  MCKAY
     Well, yes! Yes, of course we will.

  ANNOTATION
     The Helia hologram flickers but does not respond.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't think she can hear you.

  CALDWELL
     (to helmsman) Open a channel.

  ANNOTATION
     The helmsman nods and presses some controls.

  CALDWELL
     (into comm) This is Colonel Stephen Caldwell of
     the Earth ship Daedalus. It would be an honor to
     render assistance in any way we possibly can.

  ANNOTATION
     Helia smiles and nods in gratitude before the
     hologram disappears.

  MCKAY
     (ecstatic) We're gonna meet Ancients! I
     mean...flesh and-and blood Ancients who know what
     everything is and how everything works. I mean, I
     don't even know what to ask first!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard smiles at the thought.

  CALDWELL
     Well, it's gonna be a couple hours before we can
     match velocities for transport.

  SHEPPARD
     (also looking excited) That should give you enough
     time to write out that list.

  MCKAY
     Right. Right.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay races off.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, Teyla, and Ronon walk down a corridor.

  WEIR
     They were battle scarred and already well on their
     way to Earth when their hyperdrive finally gave
     out on them. They decided it was best to continue
     forward than go back.

  RONON
     How many survivors?

  WEIR
     Just over a hundred.

  TEYLA
     (excited) Word has already begun to spread amongst
     my people. They believe this return was foretold;
     that it marks the turning in the tide in the war
     against the Wraith.

  WEIR
     Well, I don't know about that.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     They have come to a stop in the Gate room. Chuck
     is on the balcony above.

  CHUCK
     Dr. Weir? The Daedalus is ready to beam down our
     people and the Ancient delegation.

  WEIR
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir nods and zippers her jacket.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, McKay, and five Ancients, including
     Helia, beam into the room near the Stargate. Weir
     and company and Sheppard and company start to walk
     towards each other.

  SHEPPARD
     Dr. Weir, Ronon, Teyla, this is Helia, captain of
     the Ancient ship Tria.

  WEIR
     (bowing slightly) It's an honor to meet you.

  HELIA
     Thank you, and from what I'm told, you've done a
     remarkable job preserving our city.

  WEIR
     Well, we did what we could with what we had.

  HELIA
     I need to speak to the leader of your people.

  WEIR
     I'm in charge of the Atlantis expedition.

  HELIA
     You misunderstand me, Dr. Weir. I need to talk to
     the one who can speak for all the people of Earth.

  WEIR
     That can certainly be arranged. But may I ask why?

  ANNOTATION
     A console suddenly rises up out of the floor,
     forcing Ronon to jump back out of the way. He
     raises his gun at the new device.

  MCKAY
     (flabbergasted) What is that? How come I've never
     seen that?

  ANNOTATION
     Helia puts her hand on the device, and Ancient
     systems power down all over Atlantis.

  WEIR
     Excuse me, what's going on?

  HELIA
     Thank you for all that you've done, Dr. Weir, but
     your guardianship of this city is no longer
     necessary. The city is now under my control.

  ANNOTATION
     The Atlantis expedition team exchange upset looks.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey and O'Neill sit at one side of the table;
     Helia paces at the other side.

  HELIA
     We were in a battle with Wraith cruisers. They
     proved too much for us. So we started back to
     Atlantis, only to be told the final evacuation was
     already in progress. I decided to push on to Earth
     and join the evacuees. Even, when our hyperdrive
     failed, we decided to continue on.

  WOOLSEY
     I can't begin to imagine what you and your crew
     must be going through right now.

  HELIA
     We owe you and your people a debt of gratitude,
     but we've just returned home. Home to a place we
     thought we'd never set eyes on again, and we need
     some time...alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey looks about to speak, but O'Neill jumps
     in.

  O'NEILL
     You do know that we've shed our own fair share of
     blood defending this city from the Wraith.

  HELIA
     But by your own admission, you are responsible for
     waking the Wraith.

  O'NEILL
     ...Right?

  ANNOTATION
     Floundering, O'Neill turns to Woolsey.

  WOOLSEY
     And by your own admission, you are responsible for
     the emergence of the Wraith as a species. The fact
     is, if it weren't for our expedition, there would
     be no Atlantis.

  O'NEILL
     No one's saying the city doesn't belong to you, or
     that you don't belong here. What we're saying is
     that...

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey rolls his eyes and grabs O'Neill's arm to
     interrupt him.

  WOOLSEY
     What we're asking...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks down at his arm in surprise.
     Woolsey, still looking at Helia, suddenly realizes
     he should not have done that and releases the
     general's arm.

  O'NEILL
     (accepting Woolsey's cue) What we're asking is
     that we be allowed to stay here.

  WOOLSEY
     There is so much that we can learn from you. And
     in return, we can offer supplies, manpower, the
     kind of support you'll need to restore Atlantis to
     its former glory.

  HELIA
     The day will come when your people will once again
     have a place here. But that is not this day.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey and O'Neill look away, disappointed.


LOCATION--WEIR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Weir, and Sheppard wait for the meeting to
     end.

  MCKAY
     You should be in there.

  WEIR
     I don't know what I could say at this point that
     could make any difference.

  SHEPPARD
     You're right. They want us out of here.

  MCKAY
     But why? There may be a hundred or so of them? I
     mean, they could use us, they might even need us.

  SHEPPARD
     What if you were forced from your home by a war,
     only to return to find someone on your couch,
     eating your Cheetos, watching your TV?

  MCKAY
     (squirming uncomfortably) I'd be fine with that.

  SHEPPARD
     No, you wouldn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey and O'Neill approach and enter the office.

  SHEPPARD
     How go the talks, sir?

  O'NEILL
     No talks. Listening is what we did.

  WOOLSEY
     It was, essentially, a transitional meeting. They
     needed to know how much time we needed to vacate
     the city.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill adjusts his collar.

  O'NEILL
     I said forty-eight hours, unless you need more.

  WEIR
     (quietly) No. That should be enough.

  MCKAY
     What? That's it? We're just gonna take this lying
     down? We rescued them!

  WOOLSEY
     And they're immensely grateful.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, they're not showing it!

  WOOLSEY
     From their point of view, Dr. McKay, they're being
     extremely generous. Keep in mind, that when they
     left Atlantis, we were basically a hunter-gatherer
     species.

  MCKAY
     Well, did you remind them if we hadn't hunted and
     gathered them out of the void between galaxies,
     they would still be stuck there?!

  SHEPPARD
     (under his breath) We should've left them out
     there.

  WOOLSEY
     I know you feel as though you're losing the city.

  WEIR
     This isn't just about losing a city, Richard. I
     mean, this is about losing an opportunity to talk
     with, and learn from, living, breathing Ancients!

  WOOLSEY
     They are willing, over time, to let us back in the
     city. Just not right now. That way we get all the
     benefit of Atlantis with very little of the
     risks--or expense.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, it's not like we don't have our own galaxy
     to worry about. (to Sheppard) Colonel, I'd like
     you to supervise the withdrawal.

  SHEPPARD
     (coming to attention) Yes, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey, Sheppard, and McKay depart. O'Neill steps
     close to Weir.

  O'NEILL
     Can I talk to you for a moment?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to make sure no one else can overhear.

  O'NEILL
     I didn't want to say this in front of McKay,
     because I know he'd want the job.

  WEIR
     What job?

  O'NEILL
     The Ancients are willing to leave someone behind,
     as a liaison, a kind of a...ambassador if you
     will.

  WEIR
     (excited) You know I would be more than happy to--

  O'NEILL
     (interrupting) It's not gonna be you.

  WEIR
     (fuming) Tell me someone who's more qualified for
     that job!

  O'NEILL
     I can't. But the IOA wants Woolsey.

  WEIR
     Woolsey?!

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. To paraphrase the Ancients, they think you
     won't be able to...let go.

  WEIR
     So they're going to just shut us out after
     everything we've done here?!

  O'NEILL
     (nodding sympathetically) I know. Look, you've
     done a helluva job here. I am sorry it's ending
     this way.

  WEIR
     I suppose...I can take comfort in the fact
     that...out of all the ways this expedition
     could've ended, this is definitely not the worst.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes her hand.

  WEIR
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves Weir to contemplate things in her
     office.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard packs up his personal belongings. Ronon
     knocks on the open doorway, and he and Teyla
     enter.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey. You guys all packed up?

  RONON
     (shrugging) I really don't have that much stuff.

  SHEPPARD
     (chuckling) Right.

  TEYLA
     Most of my belongings are already with my people.

  SHEPPARD
     How's that going, by the way? Are the, um,
     Ancients allowing the Athosians to stay on the
     mainland?

  TEYLA
     (hesitantly) They have found a suitable planet for
     us to relocate to--one with our own Stargate.

  SHEPPARD
     How'd that go down?

  TEYLA
     It was not the homecoming of the Ancestors my
     people envisioned.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard sighs in commiseration, then looks at his
     belongings.

  SHEPPARD
     You guys want any of this stuff? Johnny Cash
     poster? Skateboard? Suduko books?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teyla exchange looks. Sheppard shifts
     awkwardly. He steps over the bed to get closer to
     them, then sits on it.

  SHEPPARD
     You know you guys are welcome to come back with
     us, right?

  TEYLA
     My place is with my people.

  RONON
     And I can't leave this galaxy until every last
     Wraith is dead.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I just had to say it out loud.

  TEYLA
     You too should know that we would be honored if
     you decided to stay with us, John.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well I think the Air Force has got other
     plans for me.

  TEYLA
     We also just had to say it out loud.

  SHEPPARD
     Right...Well, this sucks.

  RONON
     Yeah.

  SHEPPARD
     I'm not...I'm not...I'm not good at...goodbyes.

  TEYLA
     Our paths will cross again, John Sheppard. Of
     that, I am sure.

  SHEPPARD
     Well before our paths uncross...could you give me
     a hand with these boxes? I-I'll throw in pizza and
     some beer and...

  TEYLA
     Popcorn?

  SHEPPARD
     And popcorn. For the...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard is interrupted by Ronon grabbing him in a
     bear hug and lifting him out of the way.

  SHEPPARD
     (breathless) Oh my god.

  ANNOTATION
     They all laugh as they begin to move the
     containers.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS SCIENCE LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Zelenka, McKay, and Beckett are amongst the
     personnel packing up computers and various
     equipment.

  ZELENKA
     Well, I was offered a position at Masurik
     University right before I came here. I imagine I
     could work there if I wanted to. What about you,
     Carson?

  BECKETT
     Well, they offered me a surgery position at
     Stargate Command. (to McKay) You?

  MCKAY
     I don't know. Area 51, I guess. Tool around with
     as much of the database as we're able to bring
     back with us.

  ZELENKA
     You know, in a way, I look forward to focusing on
     a single problem for a while. Being continually
     pulled off of research to put out fires can
     be...you know, frustrating.

  MCKAY
     Eh, I suppose so. I just don't know how many times
     I'm gonna be asked to, uh, "save the day at the
     eleventh hour" at Area 51.

  BECKETT
     Oh, I'm sure it will come up.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, not as often as I'd like.

  BECKETT
     Well, I must admit, it's been a pleasure working
     with you both. In fact, out of all the people...

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett becomes overcome with emotion and can't
     continue.

  MCKAY
     You are not tearing up on me, are you? Oh he is,
     he's tearing up.

  ZELENKA
     I know.

  BECKETT
     (annoyed) Now you've ruined it.

  MCKAY
     (insincerely) Oh, I'm sorry.

  BECKETT
     I was just about to say something!

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett angrily packs up the rest of his items.

  MCKAY
     Well, it's not like we not gonna see each other at
     the 'gate!

  BECKETT
     No. Of course not. I don't know what I was
     thinking.

  ANNOTATION
     He slams the case shut and begins to rush out.

  MCKAY
     (calling after him) What was it?

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett pauses.

  BECKETT
     What?

  MCKAY
     What you were going to say. Just say it. Now I'm
     curious.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett turns around.

  BECKETT
     I was going to say...Goodbye, Rodney.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves as Zelenka quietly waves. McKay watches
     Beckett go.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, NIGHT


LOCATION--WEIR'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Weir packs up books. The door signal chimes. She
     goes to answer it. Sheppard is outside with a
     clipboard in his hands.

  WEIR
     Colonel!

  SHEPPARD
     Doctor.

  WEIR
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     She gestures him inside.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we are way ahead of schedule. Ready to head
     out at 0800. Daedalus is gonna take most of the
     gear. People and their odds and ends will make
     their way through the Stargate thanks to the
     Ancients' new ZPM.

  WEIR
     Good...I guess. You're taking this rather well.

  SHEPPARD
     Actually, I'm pissed. For one thing, I'm only a
     quarter of the way through War and Peace.

  WEIR
     I can't imagine what I can possibly do for a
     living now.

  SHEPPARD
     Every government in the world's going to offer you
     a job.

  WEIR
     Yeah, but...not like this.

  ANNOTATION
     She gestures around her.

  SHEPPARD
     (teasingly) Yeah, you're right. It's all downhill
     from here. You've peaked.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir gives a small smile.

  SHEPPARD
     "Life isn't fair. It's just fairer than death."

  WEIR
     (puzzled) Oscar Wilde?

  SHEPPARD
     The Princess Bride. Good movie.

  WEIR
     Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     They stand looking at each other awkwardly.

  SHEPPARD
     You gonna be ready to head out at 0800?

  WEIR
     Yeah, yeah I should be. You?

  SHEPPARD
     Just one or two--hundred things to do. I'll see
     you at the 'gate.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leaves. Weir sees a light from her
     window. She goes to look at the moon shining over
     the city.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is active. Personnel depart. McKay
     stands speaking to Helia at the control room.

  MCKAY
     Grounding station on the south pier's a bit
     twitchy. It got shot up. Wasn't our fault. You
     need to look at that.

  HELIA
     I'm sure we'll find our way, Doctor.

  MCKAY
     No, I'm sure you will, but um, you should also,
     uh...

  WEIR
     (calling from below) Rodney.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks down to see Weir, Sheppard, Teyla,
     Beckett, and Ronon waiting for him. Beckett jerks
     his head for McKay to join them.

  MCKAY
     Uh, right. Yes, well...I gotta go.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads down to join the others.

  TEYLA
     You have been good friends, to all the people of
     this galaxy.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard approaches and he and Teyla touch
     foreheads in the Athosian manner.

  TEYLA
     Farewell.

  SHEPPARD
     Take care.

  ANNOTATION
     Helia watches as the team gets ready to leave.
     Teyla and Ronon head back down a corridor.

  MCKAY
     (to Teyla) Bye. (to others) Hi.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett, McKay, and Sheppard step through the
     Stargate. Weir pauses and looks back at the room,
     taking it all in before she leaves.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard helps Wallace limp down the ramp from the
     active Stargate, the rest of the SG team behind
     him. He is dressed in green SG team BDUs, but
     wears no patches.

  WALLACE
     Ow!

  SHEPPARD
     Get your damn weight off your foot, you'll be
     fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Wallace is handed over to medical staff who hustle
     him out of the room. Landry stands at the base of
     the ramp. Babbis looks very wet.

  LANDRY
     Tell me you didn't engage the Ori, Colonel.

  SHEPPARD
     We didn't engage the Ori, sir. Babbis here was
     inspecting some curious fauna when he discovered
     the ground underneath him wasn't stable. He fell
     twenty feet into a babbling brook. Wallace there
     was trying to help him get back up when he lost
     his footing, and...broke his ankle.

  LANDRY
     I see.

  SHEPPARD
     I never thought I'd miss Rodney McKay being a
     member of my team.

  LANDRY
     Well, chemistry doesn't happen overnight. We'll
     debrief as soon as Wallace is out of the
     infirmary.

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate begins to activate. The team moves
     off the ramp and begins to head out.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Offworld activation.

  LANDRY
     Hold on, Colonel. You may get a kick out of this.
     This should be General O'Neill on his scheduled
     check-in from Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard follows Landry up to the control room.

  SHEPPARD
     He went back, sir?

  LANDRY
     Uh, Woolsey needed a little back-up. Apparently
     the Ancients find him a bit trying. Heh. Imagine
     that.

  SHEPPARD
     (smirking) Hmm.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey and O'Neill appear on a monitor. Sheppard
     and Landry stand in front of it.

  O'NEILL
     General!

  LANDRY
     General!

  O'NEILL
     Is that Sheppard there with you?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir.

  WOOLSEY
     Talks are proceeding at an acceptable pace. But
     the real news is that the Pegasus Replicators are
     heading back to Atlantis to make another run at
     the city.

  SHEPPARD
     They are?

  O'NEILL
     No one here seems to be that worried about it.

  LANDRY
     Why not?

  O'NEILL
     They're Ancients!

  WOOLSEY
     Apparently these Replicators have a law in their
     base code that makes it impossible for them to
     harm their creators.

  SHEPPARD
     (biting his lip) And they're expecting to find us.

  O'NEILL
     According to Helia, they're gonna run into some
     kind of nasty surprise.

  WOOLSEY
     So you can pass it on to Doctor McKay that if you
     and he hadn't rescued the Ancients and returned
     Atlantis to their care...

  SHEPPARD
     Might've lost the city anyway.

  O'NEILL
     Right. Well, we should get back to our talks...and
     talks and talks. O'Neill out.

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole connection shuts down, closing off
     Woolsey and O'Neill's communication.

  SHEPPARD
     Sir, I'd be happy to talk to you more about these
     Replicator guys..?

  LANDRY
     Nah, it sounds like they've got everything under
     control.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry walks away.

  SHEPPARD
     (diappointed) Yes, sir. I guess they do.


LOCATION--SHEPPARD'S OFFICE, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard plays darts, missing the dart board at
     times, while speaking to McKay on a hands free
     telephone.

  MCKAY
     (over phone) I hate it here.

  SHEPPARD
     How is that possible?


LOCATION--AREA 51

  ANNOTATION
     McKay stands near an observation window where a
     large turbine and/or reactor can be seen. He is
     speaking to Sheppard on his cellular phone.

  MCKAY
     It's true!

  SHEPPARD
     (over phone) Look, they gave you everything you
     wanted.


LOCATION--SHEPPARD'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     NOTE: The rest of the conversation interchanges
     between McKay and Sheppard's locations.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard moves over to his desk and sits down,
     toying with a model F-302.

  SHEPPARD
     (continuing) Your own lab.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, it's too big.

  SHEPPARD
     Hand-picked assistants.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, sycophants, every one of them.

  SHEPPARD
     Even your own choice of projects.

  MCKAY
     Well, that's not true.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, other than going back to Atlantis, I mean.

  MCKAY
     (sighing) You know, the truth is, I...

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, I don't-I don't want to use the term
     "lonely," But, uh, there are certain people
     who...I miss.

  SHEPPARD
     Me?

  MCKAY
     (scoffing) You?! You I'm talking with on the phone
     right now and having dinner with tomorrow, so, not
     so much. But other people, people who I may never
     see again...like even Elizabeth. She doesn't
     return any of my calls.

  SHEPPARD
     I know what you mean.

  MCKAY
     (sighing again) Hey, at least you still get to go
     off-world with a team of your own.

  SHEPPARD
     (sarcastically) Oh, yeah, the best and the
     brightest. All right, I'll see you tomorrow night.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, wouldn't miss it. Hey, you know I...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard hangs up. McKay lowers his phone.

  MCKAY
     Yeah.


LOCATION--WEIR'S APARTMENT, COLORADO SPRINGS

  ANNOTATION
     Weir sits in her cluttered living room. Pizza
     boxes and takeout containers are scattered
     everywhere. She is dressed in sweats, her hair
     uncomed and writing furiously. There is a knock at
     the door. She gets up and looks out the peep hole.
     She takes a deep breath, bracing herself and opens
     the door. Beckett is outside.

  WEIR
     Carson.

  BECKETT
     Hello, Elizabeth.

  WEIR
     Well, this is a surprise.

  BECKETT
     Well, you didn't return my messages, so I thought
     I'd just stop by.

  WEIR
     Oh. Yeah, sorry about that. Come in.

  BECKETT
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett enters and takes in the state of the
     living room. Embarrassed, Weir starts picking up
     stray items.

  WEIR
     Oh, excuse the mess. I wasn't really expecting
     company.

  BECKETT
     Oh, please, I'm from a family of seven. Our home
     was never this clean. You look good.

  WEIR
     Uh, well, thanks for lying. How is the SGC
     treating you?

  BECKETT
     It's only been six weeks, so I'm still settling
     in. But it's good. Interesting work. Kind people.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir starts piling the takeout containers.

  WEIR
     Good. That's good.

  BECKETT
     How about you?

  WEIR
     Oh, you know. Keeping busy.

  BECKETT
     Oh, yeah? Doing what?

  WEIR
     I've been doing a bit of writing, uh, working on
     my memoirs.

  BECKETT
     Your memoirs? About your time in Atlantis?

  WEIR
     Yeah, somewhat.

  BECKETT
     And on what planet did you expect to publish it?

  WEIR
     I supposed it's for posterity as much as anything
     else...and for me. I'm just trying to get it
     straight in my own head. It all went by so fast,
     you know?

  BECKETT
     Aye, that it did.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps closer.

  BECKETT
     Elizabeth, we're all a bit worried about you.

  WEIR
     (nervously scoffing) You're worried about me? Why?

  BECKETT
     Well, you don't return phone calls, and the few
     times that you've ran into people, they say you
     seemed distant.

  WEIR
     I'm just...I'm just trying to move on.

  BECKETT
     By writing your memoirs?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir looks down. Beckett sits in front of her.

  BECKETT
     Elizabeth...why haven't you taken another
     position?

  WEIR
     The SGC has asked me to consult with the IOA and
     Homeworld Securities with the ongoing
     conversations with the Ancients.

  BECKETT
     You don't need to be here for that. You could
     easily take another position and consult them from
     a secure phone line.

  WEIR
     I guess I'm just not ready yet.

  BECKETT
     Look, Rodney's flying in tomorrow. John and I are
     taking him for dinner. You should come.

  WEIR
     Tomorrow? Oh gosh, tomorrow I...

  BECKETT
     I'll pick you up at seven.

  ANNOTATION
     He taps her on the leg and leaves. Weir watches
     him go with a small smile.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS, DAY


LOCATION--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey, O'Neill, Helia and others watch an
     Ancient holographic monitor indicating a large
     ship. A smaller vessel approaches it.

  WOOLSEY
     That seems like a pretty big ship. You're sure
     only sending one jumper up to fend it off is the
     right thing to do?

  HELIA
     (smiling) It is impossible for them to harm us.

  O'NEILL
     I could use some enemies like that.

  JUMPER PILOT
     (over comm) We have established communications,
     Commander.

  HELIA
     (into comm) This is Commander Helia. The city you
     are approaching is once again under Lantian
     control. Stand down and return to your planet
     immediately, or you will be...

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows the jumper destroyed.

  WOOLSEY
     I thought you said they couldn't harm you!

  HELIA
     Raise the shield!

  ANNOTATION
     The city is rocked by a weapon's blast.


LOCATION--RESTAURANT, COLORADO SPRINGS

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, Weir, Beckett, and McKay enjoy their
     dinners.

  SHEPPARD
     You should call her.

  MCKAY
     (agreeing) Hmm.

  BECKETT
     Who? Cadman?

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard nods.

  WEIR
     (smiling) You guys did make a cute couple.

  BECKETT
     It didn't work out. It may have something to do
     with our first kiss being through Rodney.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay drops his spoon.

  MCKAY
     Oh, I thought we made a solemn vow never to speak
     of that again.

  BECKETT
     (grinning) I remember no such thing.

  WEIR
     You know what? It's getting late.

  SHEPPARD
     Since when do you sleep?

  WEIR
     Mmm. Since I got back. I've had a lot of catching
     up to do. But it's-it's been lovely seeing all of
     you again. Thank you for getting me out.

  ANNOTATION
     She pats Beckett on the arm.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we should thank you. You're taking us to
     dinner, right?

  WEIR
     (with sly grin) Cheeky.

  ANNOTATION
     She reaches for her purse. Suddenly cell phones
     begin to ring around the table.

  SHEPPARD
     (into phone) Sheppard.

  MCKAY
     (into phone) McKay.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir digs her phone out of her purse. The caller
     I.D. reads NORAD.

  WEIR
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett feels his pockets.

  BECKETT
     I didn't bring my bloody cell phone with me.
     What's happened?


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The foursome now sit around the briefing room
     table. Landry walks around them holding a remote.

  LANDRY
     We got this databurst about twenty minutes ago.

  ANNOTATION
     He keys the remote. A very fuzzy image of O'Neill
     and Woolsey in the Atlantis control room appears.

  O'NEILL
     (on recording) Atlantis is under attack from
     replicators! Somehow, they've figured out how to
     override their programming. The Ancients were
     taken off-guard and have lost most of the city
     already. Request immediate evacuation!

  ANNOTATION
     Behind him, Woolsey fires a pistol.

  WOOLSEY
     They're coming!

  O'NEILL
     Gah!

  ANNOTATION
     The transmission abruptly terminates. Everyone
     stares in shock.

  LANDRY
     They never made it to the 'gate. I was informed
     they had a law written into their base code that
     made it impossible for them to harm the Ancients.
     How the hell did this happen?

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks at McKay.

  MCKAY
     It is...remotely possible that in trying to
     rewrite Niam's base code, I--we may have opened
     the door for them to make other changes?

  LANDRY
     You did this?!

  WEIR
     At the time, we thought it was the only possible
     way to save the city.

  SHEPPARD
     How it happened doesn't matter. They may have
     changed it on their own. The question is, how do
     we fix it?

  LANDRY
     That's why I called you in. I have my orders. The
     Daedalus is already on its way. Now what I need
     from you is...what's the best way to get a nuke
     past the shield?

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls up a schematic of Atlantis on the monitor
     screen. Everyone looks at each other.

  BECKETT
     Well, I have no idea.

  LANDRY
     I didn't call you in, Doctor.

  WEIR
     You're going to use nuclear weapons on Atlantis?!

  LANDRY
     It's the gateway to Earth!

  MCKAY
     And we have an iris.

  LANDRY
     Yes, we do. But thanks to your intergalactic gate
     bridge, all they have to do is rewrite your macro,
     and they can come out anywhere in the Milky Way!

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but those macros are very complicated.

  LANDRY
     They are very complicated, Doctor McKay. They just
     rewrote their own damn base code! I think they can
     handle it.

  SHEPPARD
     Sir, General O'Neill and Woolsey may still be
     alive. Now, I know the city like the back of my
     hand. Just give me sixty marines and-and some of
     Colonel Carter's new, um...

  MCKAY
     Anti-replicator weapons.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, those things.

  LANDRY
     (resolute) I'm sorry, Colonel. I have standing
     orders. They happen to be General O'Neill's
     standing orders. The Daedalus will be there in a
     little under four days. Now how do I get a nuke
     past their shield.


LOCATION--SHEPPARD'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, Beckett, McKay and Sheppard are all in the
     office.

  BECKETT
     Now, those replicator thingamajigies you're
     talking about...

  SHEPPARD
     Let's just call them ARGs.

  MCKAY
     They're energy weapons. They disrupt the link
     between the nanite cells. The Replicators
     literally fall apart when you fire on them.

  SHEPPARD
     You know, uh, hypothetically, Teyla and Ronon
     would be more than willing to help...if we asked.

  WEIR
     We would need to gate into Atlantis. All they need
     to do to keep us out is activate the 'gate shield.

  MCKAY
     Well, I did write a backdoor to the shield
     program. Couple years ago when Kolya stormed the
     city? So, I mean, it could "hypothetically" let us
     get into the Gate Room.

  WEIR
     General Landry was worried about the Replicators
     rewriting the bridge macro to 'gate them somewhere
     else in the Milky Way. Does that mean you could
     change the macro? Take us somewhere else in
     Pegasus?

  SHEPPARD
     Somewhere like, uh...just talking here, uh,...the
     Athosian settlement where Teyla and Ronon are?

  MCKAY
     (inspired) We'd need a jumper!

  SHEPPARD
     (snapping his fingers) And, uh, some of those
     ARGs.

  WEIR
     And...someone to make sure Landry doesn't close
     the iris on us.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  WEIR
     Hypothetically.

  BECKETT
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard nods.


LOCATION--SGC LEVEL 19 CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Weir walk down the corridor.

  MCKAY
     The jumper is in its storage area under guard. We
     need for one of us to be added to the authorized
     personnel list, and there's only one guy who can
     do that.

  WEIR
     You?

  MCKAY
     (confused) No. Why'd you think I was going to say
     me?

  WEIR
     I don't know. It seemed like you were leading up
     to it.

  MCKAY
     No, sadly, Dr. Lee's been the one heading up the
     jumper research project because they refuse to
     send it to Area 51 for me. But, um, I think I
     should be able to able to add one of our key cards
     to the authorized personnel list, but, um, I have
     to do that from his office.

  WEIR
     So?

  MCKAY
     Well, he's in his office. So you need to distract
     him.

  WEIR
     Me? How?

  MCKAY
     Well, here's what I'm thinking...


LOCATION--LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Weir stands by Lee. McKay stands further back by
     Lee's computer.

  LEE
     (excited) I got to say, I have never met a woman
     this into World of Warcraft.

  I...


  ANNOTATION
     They look back at McKay, who smiles. Weir grins
     with false brightness.

  WEIR
     It's a silent passion of mine.

  LEE
     (nodding sagely) As it is with all of us. I'm uh,
     Level 75, mage, specializing in engineering and
     jewelling. You?

  ANNOTATION
     While Lee and Weir speak, McKay turns to the
     computer and starts to type, shifting the screen
     so Lee can't see it.

  WEIR
     Oh, wow, Level 75. Me, I'm only...fifty.

  ANNOTATION
     Weir moves so Lee is completely back to McKay.
     Weir watches McKay. He whirls his hand to give him
     more time.

  LEE
     Ah, well, I had the beta of the expansion pack, so
     I sorta had a leg up on most people. What's your
     race?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir glances at McKay. He gives a signal for her
     to stretch out the conversation.

  WEIR
     Mage.

  LEE
     You know I-I'm trying to increase my enchanter
     skills, but, uh...I don't know. It's just not
     going very well.

  WEIR
     Oh, I disagree, Bill.

  LEE
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Weir shrugs flirtatiously.

  LEE
     Oh! Uh, Rodney...

  ANNOTATION
     He begins to turn around. McKay looks up,
     panicked. Weir reaches out to keep Lee facing her,
     brushing down his lab coat.

  WEIR
     I-I don't mean...I'm sorry. I don't mean to be
     so...forward.

  LEE
     No, no, no. Be forward. I'm...

  ANNOTATION
     They both chuckle nervously. McKay gets back to
     typing, replacing Nirman, Wallace with his own
     name.

  WEIR
     Well, oh, I, look, I...I'm...not quite sure how
     exactly I should put this.

  LEE
     A true mage speaks his mind, or, her mind, in your
     case.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sets the computer screen back where it was.

  MCKAY
     (loudly) Wow! Will you look at the time. Where
     does it go, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee turns around blankly. Weir slouches in relief.

  LEE
     What?

  MCKAY
     Uh, we're late, we should...um, book. We'll see
     you, Bill!

  ANNOTATION
     He hurries out. Weir follows.

  WEIR
     Bye, Bill!

  ANNOTATION
     A confused Lee watches them leave.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The Atlantis group is all geared up and heading
     down the corridor. They suddenly meet up with
     Wallace, who's moving slowly on crutches.

  SHEPPARD
     Wallace. What are you doing here?

  WALLACE
     General Landry wanted to talk to me about
     reassignment.

  SHEPPARD
     (wincing) Oh, right. Sorry about that.

  WALLACE
     Are you already going on missions without me,
     or...?

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett lays a comforting hand on Wallace's
     shoulder. Sheppard moves past to check the
     corridor behind them is empty.

  BECKETT
     You should really stay off of that ankle, son.

  WALLACE
     Yeah, well when General Landry says now, it's now.

  SHEPPARD
     Sorry about this, too.

  ANNOTATION
     He primes a zat and fires it at Wallace. He helps
     lower the stunned Wallace gently to the floor.
     Beckett takes the crutches away. They drag him
     into the armory.

  SHEPPARD
     Can't afford to have him tell Landry he ran into
     us.


LOCATION--JUMPER STORAGE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     The team approach and hide on the side. Sheppard
     looks in the front window, seeing only Siler
     working on the cargo bay. He heads towards the
     back of the jumper, readying his zat. He shoots
     Siler, knocking him unconscious.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  SHEPPARD
     Let's move!

  ANNOTATION
     He heads to the cockpit. The others join him,
     Beckett and Weir dragging Siler outside. McKay
     uses a computer outside to interface with the SGC
     dialing computer, dialing the intergalactic
     bridge.

  MCKAY
     You set?

  SHEPPARD
     Go for it!

  ANNOTATION
     McKay joins the others inside the jumper.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate begins to spin and dial an outgoing
     wormhole. Harriman looks at his instruments in
     puzzlement.

  HARRIMAN
     What the hell? (into intercom) General Landry to
     the control room immediately!


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  MCKAY
     Okay, they're going to be able to get through my
     hack pretty quickly.

  SHEPPARD
     That's all right. I don't need much time.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry arrives.

  LANDRY
     What's going on?

  HARRIMAN
     I don't know, sir. The 'gate just started dialing
     on its own.

  LANDRY
     It doesn't do that.

  HARRIMAN
     (annoyed) I know that, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper lowers into the Gate Room.

  LANDRY
     Close the iris!

  HARRIMAN
     I can't, sir.

  LANDRY
     Find a way, Walter. (into microphone) Colonel
     Sheppard, stand down! That is a direct order.

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper flies through the active wormhole, and
     the Stargate shuts down.

  HARRIMAN
     Do you want me to...try to find out where they're
     going, sir?

  LANDRY
     Don't bother. I already know.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The jumper sits inside the partially constructed
     station between the two galaxies.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     They wait while Rodney works on the macro on his
     computer.

  BECKETT
     My turtles!

  WEIR
     What?

  BECKETT
     I just bought some wee baby turtles, and no one
     knows to feed them.

  WEIR
     Well, turtles are pretty hardy. I'm sure they'll
     be fine.

  SHEPPARD
     And they make good soup.

  ANNOTATION
     Beckett looks nonplussed at Sheppard's statement.

  BECKETT
     Well, I figure I'm back for good, so I might as
     well get a pet. And, I'm allergic to cats, and
     uh...well, I'm at work too long to be fair to a
     dog, so I went with turtles. I probably killed
     them.

  SHEPPARD
     Anytime now, McKay.

  MCKAY
     Oh trust me, I am going as fast as I can.

  BECKETT
     Poor little buggers.

  ANNOTATION
     The HUD comes to life. Sheppard studies it.

  SHEPPARD
     The Milky Way 'gate just activated. Did you do
     that?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry appears on the HUD.

  MCKAY
     Nope.

  LANDRY
     (over transmission) Colonel Sheppard. I'm going to
     assume that you're still at the midway station
     waiting for Doctor McKay to rewrite his macro. I
     understand what you're doing, Colonel. Hell, I'll
     even call it brave, but if you don't turn that
     ship around immediately and come back to the SGC,
     I'll see to it personally that your career in the
     military is--

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, who's looked uncomfortable all the
     while. Reaches out and shuts down the
     transmission. Everyone looks at him. He shrugs.

  SHEPPARD
     That way I won't know what he was gonna say.

  MCKAY
     Okay! Okay, I've got it.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, last chance to change our minds.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks back at Sheppard with determined
     expressions.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, let's do it.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT


  ANNOTATION
     There are intermittent flashes of orange light
     during the extended wormhole passage.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Ladon sits across a table from Teyla and Ronon.

  LADON
     I knew you would never come to me, so I thought I
     would come to you. Our relationship has
     been...strained. But we need to put all that
     behind us, now.

  RONON
     We do?

  LADON
     Well, your friends have all returned home, and
     you've been asked to leave Atlantis. So the
     question is, what will you do next?

  TEYLA
     We are helping my people rebuild this settlement.

  LADON
     Yes, but the settlement seems finished. Besides,
     is carpentry and clearing brush really the best
     use of your skills.

  TEYLA
     Get to the point.

  LADON
     Come work with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon scoffs.

  LADON
     I understand your reluctance. In the past, the
     Genii have hardly been the shining beacon of hope
     in the galaxy.

  RONON
     In the past?

  LADON
     We are growing stronger every day. And we have a
     number of operations planned that could seriously
     cripple the Wraith.

  TEYLA
     What do you have in mind?

  LADON
     Well, I am of course reluctant to go into specific
     details here. But suffice it to say, the plans are
     dangerous, and in need of your unique abilities.

  RONON
     We're not interested.

  LADON
     Well, that's too bad, although not entirely
     surprising. Give it some time, Ronon. I wonder how
     much joy you'll find as a tava-bean farmer.


LOCATION--ATHOSIAN CAMP, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Ronon leave the tent and stand over a
     campfire. A pot of stew hangs cooking over it.

  RONON
     I'm not gonna start working for the Genii!

  TEYLA
     We would not be working for them, merely...with
     them.

  ANNOTATION
     She doesn't look convinced herself.

  RONON
     Forget it.

  TEYLA
     Since Atlantis was returned to the Ancestors, the
     Genii are the most powerful and organized group of
     humans fighting the Wraith.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon studies her.

  RONON
     The Ancestors will do something.

  TEYLA
     True. But they neither need, nor have they
     requested our help. The Genii have.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon grimaces.

  TEYLA
     I know that you are anxious to return to the
     fight, but...my people are farmers!

  RONON
     Maybe this isn't the place for me then.

  SHEPPARD
     That smells great!

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla and Ronon spin around. They see Sheppard,
     McKay, Weir and Beckett entering the camp, smiling
     at them.

  SHEPPARD
     Hope you saved some for us.

  TEYLA
     (elated) John?! It is wonderful to see you--all of
     you!

  WEIR
     And you.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard points to the pot.

  SHEPPARD
     We missed that...whatever that is.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon has gotten over his surprise and studies the
     team.

  RONON
     Something's wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     Teyla turns back, studying the others, concerned.


LOCATION--TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is standing around inside the tent. McKay
     distributes ARGs.

  MCKAY
     They emit a directional energy beam that disrupts
     the connection between nanites.

  RONON
     Not what I asked.

  MCKAY
     Er, yes. They work good.

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon practices aiming his gun.

  RONON
     Good. So you need us because, uh, we know our way
     around the city?

  SHEPPARD
     I need you because you're part of our team.

  TEYLA
     There may be hundreds of Replicators on Atlantis
     by now.

  SHEPPARD
     We've got a plan. A good one. I wouldn't ask you
     to come with us if I didn't think we could do it.

  WEIR
     Also, General O'Neill and Richard Woolsey were
     both on Atlantis when the Replicators attacked.
     There is a chance they're still alive.

  SHEPPARD
     I'll be damned if I'm going to let a bunch of
     Replicators take our home away from us. So...you
     with us?

  ANNOTATION
     Ronon and Teyla exchange looks then smile at
     Sheppard. Sheppard nods and smiles.


LOCATION--NEW ATHOS STARGATE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper hovers by the Stargate.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  ANNOTATION
     McKay, Beckett, Teyla, Ronon, Weir and Sheppard
     are all inside.

  MCKAY
     Okay, I think I've loaded up the GDO. It'll lower
     the shield when we dial.

  SHEPPARD
     Go for it.

  MCKAY
     All right. Dialing Atlantis.

  ANNOTATION
     Her nervously presses the dialing buttons.

  MCKAY
     And...

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS GATE AND CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate kawhooshes. The Asuran Replicators
     are startled. Several go down to man the Gate
     Room.

  TALUS
     What's happening? Activate the shield.

  ANNOTATION
     Cetus works some controls.

  CETUS
     I can't.


LOCATION--PUDDLE JUMPER

  MCKAY
     That's confirmation. Gate shield has been lowered.

  SHEPPARD
     I hope this little plan of ours works.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, you and me both.


LOCATION--NEW ATHOS STARGATE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The puddle jumper flies through the active
     wormhole.
