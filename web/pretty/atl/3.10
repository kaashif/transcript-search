Since we no longer have access to a ZPM due to...unforeseeable circumstances, my only option would be to call the Daedalus and spend the next three weeks twiddling my thumbs waiting to get back home...until now. I give you the McKay-Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge. Thirty-four gates from both the Milky Way and Pegasus gate systems have been strategically placed in the massive void between our two galaxies. Simply enter on either side--for example, Atlantis--and boom! A macro that, uh, I have written especially for the occasion will command each Gate in the chain to store you in its buffer and forward you along to the next and the next, and the next, and the next, and the next, until you arrive...here.</td></tr>
