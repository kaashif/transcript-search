  ANNOTATION
     Flora and Mardola toast wine with Sheppard and
     McKay.

  FLORA
     And to another fine year of trading.

  MCKAY
     Hear, hear.

  FLORA
     Truly, the medical supplies you have given to us
     over the past several years have made an
     immeasurable difference to our people.

  MARDOLA
     Not to mention your warning last harvest that the
     Wraith were nearby. You saved many lives.

  SHEPPARD
     (modestly) Well, uh, you know.

  MCKAY
     My favorite missions are when we come here to do
     our trading. And I've said that--I can prove it.
     I'm not just...saying that.

  SHEPPARD
     You don't need to prove it. Uh, you know,
     actually, we've got to get going.

  MARDOLA
     So soon?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, so soon?

  FLORA
     We were hoping that...you could stay...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's eyes widen.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I-I guess we could stay a little longer.

  FLORA
     I hate to...no, never mind.

  MCKAY
     What is it?

  FLORA
     Well, I wouldn't dream of imposing. You've been so
     generous to our people already.

  SHEPPARD
     What's the problem?

  FLORA
     Our sister. She's in great need of your help.

  MCKAY
     I didn't even know you gals had a sister.

  FLORA
     We do, indeed.

  MCKAY
     And I imagine she's as, uh, beautiful as you two?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard look intrigued.

  FLORA
     Even more so...and she is in great need of
     guidance.

  MCKAY
     Guidance. That I can do.

  FLORA
     (sighing in relief) You are most generous. Excuse
     us, for one moment. I'll get her.

  ANNOTATION
     Flora and Mardola leave the room.

  MCKAY
     Dibs.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     I'm calling dibs on the third sister.

  SHEPPARD
     You can't call dibs!

  MCKAY
     Look, we both know that Flora and Mardola have
     been suckered in by the whole "cliche-heroic"
     thing you've got going, but, uh, maybe this other
     sister, maybe her taste in will run more to the,
     uh...

  SHEPPARD
     Geeky?

  MCKAY
     I was going to say "cerebral", but who knows?
     Maybe we'll hit it off.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't need your love life screwing up our trade
     relations.

  MCKAY
     (smug) I'll try not to break her heart, but, uh,
     no promises.

  ANNOTATION
     Footsteps approach. Flora arrives.

  FLORA
     These are the men I was telling you about.
     Gentlemen, this is our sister, Harmony.

  ANNOTATION
     Mardola and Harmony enter the room. Harmony is
     very beautiful&emdash;and around thirteen years
     old.

  MCKAY
     (disappointed) Super.

LOCATION--CASTLE DINING ROOM

  FLORA
     As you know, our mother and queen passed at the
     beginning of this lunar cycle. A secret, sacred
     ceremony was held to determine which of her three
     daughters would succeed her. It was determined
     that Harmony shall be the new queen.

  SHEPPARD
     Really? Wow. Well, congrats.

  FLORA
     Before she is crowned, all future queens must
     perform a time-honored rite of passage.

  MARDOLA
     (petulantly) A rite of passage normally performed
     alone.

  FLORA
     (firmly) It is not written one way or another. And
     Harmony is so young, it concerns me greatly.

  HARMONY
     I can do it.

  FLORA
     You are very brave, but the trail is difficult. It
     would bring me great comfort to know that you had
     someone looking out for you.

  SHEPPARD
     What kind of rite of passage are we talking about,
     here?

  FLORA
     Deep in the forest lies the ruins of the Great
     Temple of Laros. Every queen must take a
     pilgrimage before the end of the first lunar cycle
     of their selection. Once there, she must meditate
     on the journey that lies ahead of her, and pray to
     be endowed with the knowledge and power to govern
     her people.

  SHEPPARD
     How deep in the forest?

  FLORA
     No more than a day's trek.

  MCKAY
     I see. Yes. No, we, uh, we are very honored, but
     um, why don't you just have a couple of your own
     guards escort her?

  FLORA
     (reluctantly) Although it is not written so, our
     people will expect their new queen to have
     completed the journey on her own.

  SHEPPARD
     So...you don't want her to be alone, but you don't
     want anyone to know that she's getting help.

  FLORA
     Precisely.

  SHEPPARD
     Right. We'd love to lend a hand, but--

  FLORA
     (flirtatiously) John, our peoples have enjoyed
     such a fruitful alliance.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah...

  FLORA
     One that has greatly benefitted both parties.

  SHEPPARD
     Right...

  FLORA
     I'd hate to think that one of us would put that in
     jeopardy over a simple day's walk in the forest.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard doesn't know how to respond. She smiles
     at him.

  SHEPPARD
     When do we leave?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay sighs with a knowing smirk. Harmony smiles.


LOCATION--PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, McKay, and Harmony walk through a field.

  HARMONY
     (excitedly) I must confess, I'm quite looking
     forward to this. I rarely get to leave the
     confines of the castle, although I've had much
     training in forest survival.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, you have, have you?

  HARMONY
     (confidently) Oh, yes. I have completed three
     sessions with Nolar Lumsbred. He is one of the
     greatest hunters amongst my people.

  SHEPPARD
     Three whole sessions, huh?

  MCKAY
     With the Nolar Lumsbred.

  HARMONY
     They were all I needed. I am a quick learner.

  SHEPPARD
     I'll bet you are.

  HARMONY
     Tell me, which one of you is the superior officer?

  MCKAY
     You mean who outranks here?

  HARMONY
     Yes.

  MCKAY
     I'm a civilian. I don't have a rank. But,
     basically, we're equals.

  SHEPPARD
     Technically, I'm in charge.

  HARMONY
     I thought so. You have all the makings of an
     excellent leader, John.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, thank you.


LOCATION--FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard takes lead as they enter the forest.
     McKay is finishing a power bar.

  MCKAY
     You going to eat your PowerBar?

  SHEPPARD
     Yes, Rodney. I told you, you shouldn't have eaten
     yours so early in the day.

  MCKAY
     I'm starving! Usually Flora feeds us some sort of
     food when we visit. Come on! You hardly ever eat
     yours!

  SHEPPARD
     No, Rodney!

  MCKAY
     Well, will you give it to me later when you decide
     not to eat it?

  HARMONY
     You allow him to question you so incessantly?

  SHEPPARD
     I guess I'm just used to it by now.

  HARMONY
     Would it not be easier to beat him?

  MCKAY
     We don't beat people where we come from.

  HARMONY
     Why not?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we find it's not very effective in the long
     run...unfortunately.

  HARMONY
     Really? You are a truly gentle leader, John. I
     admire that.

  SHEPPARD
     Thank you, Harmony.

  ANNOTATION
     They have reached a ravine. There is pillars at
     either side, but no way across the ravine.
     Sheppard checks a piece of parchment.

  SHEPPARD
     Isn't there supposed to be a rope bridge here?

  MCKAY
     Well, maybe you're reading the map wrong.

  SHEPPARD
     No, I think it's pretty straightforward. How old
     is this map?

  HARMONY
     It has been passed down from too many generations
     to know for sure.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay, I guess that bridge doesn't exist.

  ANNOTATION
     He packs the map parchment into his vest and
     unclips his pack, leaving it on the trail.

  SHEPPARD
     You two stay put, I'm going to try to find a safe
     way across the river.

  MCKAY
     Well, no, wait, wha--

  SHEPPARD
     Don't worry. I'll be right back.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard leaves. McKay and Harmony exchange
     glances, then McKay walks away to find someplace
     to sit. Harmony starts rummaging through
     Sheppard's pack. With a sigh, McKay sits on a
     mossy tree trunk. Harmony soon joins him; she
     munches on a PowerBar.

  MCKAY
     Where'd you find that?

  HARMONY
     John's bag.

  MCKAY
     It-it's not yours.

  HARMONY
     I'm hungry.

  MCKAY
     Well, you can't just take it like that!

  HARMONY
     When I'm hungry, I eat.

  MCKAY
     What's going to happen when Sheppard finds out?

  HARMONY
     Well, he's not going to now, is he?

  MCKAY
     Well, yes he is, 'cause I'm going to tell him.

  HARMONY
     (in dangerous tone) I wouldn't do that if I were
     you.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, or what?

  HARMONY
     I'm the queen.

  MCKAY
     Not yet, you're not, little sister.

  HARMONY
     Trust me, you don't want to be on my bad side.

  MCKAY
     Right? And what are you going to do? You gonna
     have me beaten?

  ANNOTATION
     He looks nonplussed at her cold glare. Rallying,
     he stands.

  MCKAY
     All right, princess, just...hand it over!

  ANNOTATION
     She gobbles the rest of the bar and hands him the
     wrapper.

  MCKAY
     Oh...see, now you're in trouble. You just wait
     'till Sheppard gets back here, 'cause he's gonna--

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard returns from behind McKay.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, I think I found a place for us to,
     uh...

  ANNOTATION
     He spots McKay holding the empty wrapper.

  SHEPPARD
     Is that my PowerBar?

  MCKAY
     (defensively) She stole it!

  HARMONY
     (affronted) I did not!

  MCKAY
     Oh, what?! You so did! Tell him!

  HARMONY
     I would never do such a thing!

  MCKAY
     The second you were gone, she went into your bag!

  HARMONY
     You are a liar! You are a lying liar!

  MCKAY
     Oh, please, who are you going to believe?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, if she stole it, Rodney...how come you've
     got the wrapper?

  MCKAY
     (stammering) Well, bu--I...I was trying to take it
     back from her, and then she wolfs it down and
     hands me the wrapper!

  SHEPPARD
     (skeptical) Really?

  MCKAY
     (fiercely to Harmony) Okay, you'd better come
     clean, brat!

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony bursts into sobs and holds out her arms to
     Sheppard, who grudgingly steps forward to receive
     her embrace.

  SHEPPARD
     It's okay, sweetie. Sometimes, he makes me cry,
     too.

  ANNOTATION
     Her face hidden from Sheppard in this position,
     Harmony turns, dry-eyed, to McKay and makes a
     throat-slitting gesture. McKay blinks. Harmony
     continues her sobbing act.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, we need to get going here. All right? I
     found a path.

  ANNOTATION
     He extricates himself from Harmony and leads the
     way.

  HARMONY
     (whining) Can I navigate from the map?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay rolls his eyes.

  SHEPPARD
     Sure, as soon as we get back on the path.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony schools her expression back to calmness,
     and shoots McKay a bright, smug smile before
     passing him. McKay watches, flabbergasted, before
     setting his jaw and following.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Harmony leads the way, studying the map.
     They reach a fork in the trail.

  HARMONY
     (uncertain) Now...we go...

  SHEPPARD
     Right.

  HARMONY
     (confidently) Correct.

  ANNOTATION
     As they move, amongst the birds calling is the
     sound of a deep growl. McKay and Sheppard
     instantly raise their weapons.

  MCKAY
     What was that?

  HARMONY
     (blithely) That's probably the beast.

  MCKAY
     Sorry, the what now?

  HARMONY
     The beast--the protector of the Ruins of Laros.
     Did Flora not tell you of it?

  MCKAY
     (fuming) I guess she forgot to mention it.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony takes out a multi-use tool and pulls out a
     blade.

  HARMONY
     Don't worry.

  SHEPPARD
     When you say "beast", I'm assuming that's a figure
     of speech, right?

  HARMONY
     Oh, no. It's a beast, all right. Though no one is
     quite certain what it looks like. Those who have
     cast their eyes upon it have quickly perished.

  MCKAY
     (sarcastic) But your little knife will protect us.

  HARMONY
     I'm the queen. It will not harm me.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we may not get the chance to tell the beast
     that.

  HARMONY
     It will know.

  ANNOTATION
     She closes her knife blade and starts down the
     trail. McKay hurries to catch up.

  MCKAY
     Listen, why don't we just tell your sisters we
     made it as far as the ruins? We don't actually
     have to make it there. I mean, they'd never have
     to know the difference.

  HARMONY
     I would know.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, but you're going to be queen, so who cares?
     Right?

  HARMONY
     (upset) I care! My people care!

  MCKAY
     Listen...

  HARMONY
     Perhaps it would be best if you stopped speaking.
     Your voice hurts my ears!

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well, that beast could hurt my whole body,
     okay? So I'm sorry, but this is not what we signed
     up for! Sheppard, back me up here.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Sheppard for support, only to realize
     Sheppard is not with them. He looks around in
     alarm. Harmony takes out her knife again.

  MCKAY
     Sheppard? John!

  HARMONY
     According to legend, the beast attacks silently.

  MCKAY
     I thought you said the beast would know you were
     the queen.

  HARMONY
     Well, it didn't attack me.

  MCKAY
     (into radio) John? John, are you there?

  HARMONY
     It is strange, though...the beast is supposed to
     only attack enemies of the throne. If it was going
     to kill anyone, it should have killed you.

  MCKAY
     I'm not an enemy of the throne! I'm not! I'm here
     to protect you!

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     Don't move!

  ANNOTATION
     Guns can be heard cocking behind them as men in
     Genii uniforms appear out of the foliage. McKay
     raises his hands in surrender.

  HARMONY
     So far, I'm not impressed.

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     Drop your weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay unhooks the P-90 from his vest and lays it
     on the ground.

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     (into radio) We have her. Map Grid Eleven in the
     small clearing.

  TERAN THE GENII FIELD CAPTAIN
     (over radio) We're on our way.

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     (to McKay) Hand her over.

  MCKAY
     You're Genii!

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     Step aside, and hand her over.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay puts himself between Harmony and the
     soldiers.

  MCKAY
     (holding his hands up defensively) This is
     obviously some sort of huge misunderstanding, all
     right? I am-I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. I'm-I'm a
     close, personal friend of, uh, Ladon Radim. You
     know, your leader?

  ANNOTATION
     They don't lower their weapons. McKay continues to
     stand between them and Harmony, who hides behind
     McKay.

  MCKAY
     I-I'm-I'm your greatest ally! I--you don't know
     who I am? Look, I'm the genius scientist! The
     friend of John Sheppard? I gave you the bomb? No?
     Nothing? What do they teach you in Genii school?

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     Hand her over, right now.

  MCKAY
     Okay, let's just talk about this.

  ANNOTATION
     The soldier takes a couple steps forward.

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     I'm growing impatient. Our quarrel is not with
     you. Once you hand her over, you're free to go.

  MCKAY
     (perking) Really?

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     Yes.

  MCKAY
     Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     He appears to consider this option. Harmony looks
     scandalized.

  HARMONY
     You wouldn't! You took a sacred oath to protect
     me.

  MCKAY
     Nah, I don't remember doing that.

  GENII SOLDIER 1
     I'm going to count to three. One...

  ANNOTATION
     Three shots fire in rapid succession, felling the
     soldier who spoke and the two other Genii
     soldiers. Sheppard steps out from the foliage, his
     P-90 still trained on them.

  MCKAY
     Where have you been?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, my Spidey senses felt an ambush comin' on.

  MCKAY
     What, and you couldn't mention it?!

  SHEPPARD
     Well, not without tipping them off, no!

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony has stepped around McKay and now stares at
     the Genii soldier's corpse in shock.

  MCKAY
     Well, what took you so long? We were just about to
     get--

  SHEPPARD
     I had to take up a position, so I could shoot all
     three at once.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard notices Harmony's expression.

  SHEPPARD
     You okay?

  HARMONY
     (shakily, but regaining her haughtiness) No...no,
     I most certainly am not. This one was going to
     hand me over to those men.

  MCKAY
     No, I wasn't.

  HARMONY
     I saw it in your eyes. You were considering it! To
     save your own worthless, cowardly hide.

  MCKAY
     I was keeping them talking. You know? I was buying
     us time? A little thing called "strategy"?
     Obviously, you're too young to know anything about
     it.

  HARMONY
     Oh, I understand strategy. In fact, I'm forming
     one right now! The second we return to the castle,
     I will instruct my guards to--

  SHEPPARD
     (interrupting) All right. Plenty of time to come
     up with punishments along the way.

  HARMONY
     (whining) But, John--

  SHEPPARD
     Thumb screws, you like them?

  HARMONY
     (content) Yes. Thumb screws are good.

  SHEPPARD
     (lower, to McKay) We better find some cover. That
     backup-he called is going to be here any minute.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gestures Harmony to get in front of him as
     he watches the rear.

  ANNOTATION
     Some time later, Sheppard finds a sheltered area
     of fallen trees within the larger forest.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, this will work.

  MCKAY
     Those were Genii!

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I picked up on that, Rodney. Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     They crouch amongst the fallen trunks.

  MCKAY
     So what are the Genii doing here? And why do they
     want to kill her? I mean, aside from the obvious
     reasons.

  SHEPPARD
     Harmony?

  HARMONY
     I don't know. I don't like the Genii.

  MCKAY
     But you know who they are. Are you trading
     partners?

  HARMONY
     Not anymore.

  MCKAY
     (glowering) But you were.

  HARMONY
     Yes. But they cheated my mother on many trades.
     She banished them from our land.

  MCKAY
     What about you, huh? When you're queen, are you
     going to start trade back up?

  HARMONY
     No! Absolutely not!

  SHEPPARD
     So maybe somebody in the royal court's a little
     more willing to play ball, you know, once the path
     is cleared.

  HARMONY
     If I were to die, my sister would succeed me. But
     if the Genii think that she would be more willing
     to trade than me, they are sadly mistaken.

  MCKAY
     (to Sheppard) You really believe that Ladon would
     give the marching orders to kill a little girl?
     Even this one?

  SHEPPARD
     I don't know how these people work. Maybe he told
     someone to "fix the problem" and this is what they
     came up with.

  MCKAY
     Well, it's creative.

  SHEPPARD
     Knowing why they're here really doesn't help us
     out. All right, I need to get a take on how many
     are out there. You stay with her, okay?

  MCKAY
     (with resigned sigh) Sure.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Harmony) All right, stay here, and stay quiet.

  HARMONY
     (sweetly) Of course, John. Thank you for taking
     care of this. I'm not sure what I would do if you
     weren't here.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard swallows an uncomfortable groan and heads
     out. McKay takes up his guard position.

  HARMONY
     Tell me something, "Doctor." The place where you
     sleep at night...is it guarded?

  MCKAY
     I know what you're trying to do, and it's not
     going to work, okay? I'm not scared of you. You're
     just a kid--a bratty little kid. I couldn't care
     less that you're going to be queen. In fact,
     nothing could impress me less, so why don't you
     just cool it with the "bad seed" act and just go
     back to ignoring me.

  HARMONY
     Surely they can't guard you all the time?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay looks back at her with a disturbed
     expression. She shoots him an innocent smile.


LOCATION--FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Genii patrol the trail.

  TERAN
     (over radio) Squad Three, take up position on the
     ridge. Squad Four, move to Map Grid Nine.

  GENII SOLDIER
     (into radio) Acknowledged.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard remains hidden, but has heard the radio
     conversation.

  SHEPPARD
     (sotto voce) Wonderful.


LOCATION--FALLEN TRUNKS, FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony continuously glares at McKay.

  MCKAY
     Stop it. What are you doing?

  HARMONY
     I'm burning your face into my memory.

  MCKAY
     You're--

  HARMONY
     This way I can give the bounty hunters an
     extremely accurate description of you.

  MCKAY
     All right, your highness, I have had just about
     enough out of you with this whole--

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard returns.

  SHEPPARD
     (whispering fiercely) I thought I said keep
     talking to the minimum!

  MCKAY
     I was...she was...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay gives up and moves back to his former
     position.

  HARMONY
     How many Genii are out there, John?

  SHEPPARD
     If I had to guess, I'd say all of them.

  MCKAY
     (worried) What, so, a lot of them?

  SHEPPARD
     (impatient) Yes, Rodney. A lot.

  HARMONY
     This will make the pilgrimage most difficult.

  SHEPPARD
     That's funny. I was thinking the same thing.

  HARMONY
     I find we have much in common, John.

  SHEPPARD
     (noncommittally) Mmm. Yeah. Anyway, I figure we
     wait for nightfall, and then head back to the
     settlement.

  HARMONY
     Back to the settlement?

  SHEPPARD
     Yep. Road trip's over.

  HARMONY
     But that would make this journey a failure!

  SHEPPARD
     You win some, you lose some. If you want to be
     queen, you've got to learn how to cut your losses.

  HARMONY
     But the lunar cycle is nearing its end. If I do
     not make it to the ruins by tomorrow's sundown, I
     will forfeit the throne!

  SHEPPARD
     I'm sure they'll make an exception.

  HARMONY
     No, they cannot. It is our way.

  SHEPPARD
     (with frustrated sigh) It's too dangerous to move
     forward.

  HARMONY
     For you, perhaps.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard makes a face and turns to face her.

  SHEPPARD
     (emphatically) If it's too dangerous for me, it's
     definitely too dangerous for you. We're gonna wait
     for nightfall, and then we're gonna head back to
     the village. End of discussion!

  MCKAY
     (drily) Fat chance of that.

  HARMONY
     It's not your decision to make. I'm the queen.

  SHEPPARD
     (fiercely) No, not yet! And until you are, you're
     just a regular kid. I call the shots!

  HARMONY
     (standing) Many would consider disobeying the
     queen a treasonous act.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I'm sure they wouldn't look too fondly on
     letting the queen get killed. We're heading back.


LOCATION--CASTLE, NIGHT


LOCATION--MARDOLA'S BEDCHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     There is a soft knock at the door. Mardola goes to
     answer it. Teran is there, wearing a hooded cloak.
     She lets him in.

  MARDOLA
     You should not be here.

  TERAN
     I was careful. No one saw me, don't worry. We use
     this from now on to stay in contact.

  ANNOTATION
     He lays a Genii radio on the table.

  MARDOLA
     Does that mean it's not over yet?

  TERAN
     No. Her two guardians have complicated things
     greatly. They killed three of my men.

  MARDOLA
     Yes, well, they were an unforeseen complication.
     My apologies.

  TERAN
     Your apologies do me little good.

  MARDOLA
     We will increase your pay. Don't worry. Threefold.

  TERAN
     (intrigued) Threefold?

  MARDOLA
     Triple the work, triple the pay.

  TERAN
     You want us to kill them all?

  MARDOLA
     If they survive, they'll come back and tell my
     sister that the Genii were involved. Now we can't
     have that, can we?

  ANNOTATION
     Teran hisses, then bows and takes his leave.


LOCATION--FALLEN TRUNKS, FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony sleeps under a blanket at their makeshift
     shelter. McKay steps around her to join Sheppard
     out at the "entrance".

  MCKAY
     (low) Listen...I've been doing a little thinking.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, you have, have you?

  MCKAY
     I've got a Wraith stunner in my backpack. She
     can't weigh more than ninety pounds. I say we stun
     her and just carry her back.

  SHEPPARD
     (considering) Hmm...Nah, we can't stun a thirteen
     year old girl.

  MCKAY
     It's kind of dangerous out there. I mean, the
     forest is crawling with Genii. Who knows when she
     could throw one of her fits.

  SHEPPARD
     She'll be fine. She understands how dangerous this
     situation is. I talked to her.

  MCKAY
     I'm sure you did, but she is thirteen, she's
     unreasonable, among many other awful attributes.

  SHEPPARD
     You know, they say you dislike the things in
     others that you, in fact, dislike about yourself.

  MCKAY
     So, what?

  SHEPPARD
     I'm just saying...

  MCKAY
     We are nothing alike!

  SHEPPARD
     Okay.

  MCKAY
     She is a stuck-up, know-it-all brat...

  ANNOTATION
     He stares at Sheppard who pointedly flinches but
     says nothing.

  MCKAY
     Oh, ha ha ha.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, it's about as dark as it's going to
     get. Let's wake her up and get moving.

  ANNOTATION
     They turn around to find Harmony is gone.

  SHEPPARD
     Oh, no.

  MCKAY
     Oh, that sneaky little...I told you we should've
     stunned her!


LOCATION--FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay move cautiously through the
     woods, searching for Harmony. They keep their
     voices low.

  MCKAY
     I'm going to kill her.

  SHEPPARD
     You really need to work on your child skills.

  MCKAY
     We have been searching for her for over an hour.
     You know, we have had not one, but-but two close
     encounters with the Genii. All so some...useless,
     spoiled brat can make her meditation appointment?

  SHEPPARD
     More searching, less complaining.

  MCKAY
     Sorry, I'm hungry. And when I'm hungry, I get
     cranky.

  SHEPPARD
     And when you get cranky, you get hit.

  MCKAY
     Okay, okay.

  SHEPPARD
     I wish Ronon was here.

  MCKAY
     You know...you said that out loud, right? I mean,
     I-I'm right here.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, it's nothing personal. It's just he's a
     better tracker than both of us combined.

  MCKAY
     Hmm, that's true.

  ANNOTATION
     They continue through the forest.

  MCKAY
     Okay, I'm starting to hallucinate.

  SHEPPARD
     Why? What do you see?

  MCKAY
     Not see, smell. I smell food. Delicious,
     fresh-cooked food. Roast beef, hamburgers, hot
     dogs, pork on a spit.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard pauses.

  SHEPPARD
     Chicken.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, sure, the more, the merrier.

  SHEPPARD
     No, I smell...chicken.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay taps his nose and starts moving forward.

  MCKAY
     The nose that knows. Follow me.


LOCATION--CAVE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard arrive at a cave entrance.

  MCKAY
     Ah. Found it. It's coming from down there. Told
     you. You don't need Ronon while I'm here.

  SHEPPARD
     Uh-huh.

  MCKAY
     What do you think? Genii camp?

  SHEPPARD
     Give me the stunner.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay pulls it out of his pack and hands it over.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, stay behind me.

  ANNOTATION
     He moves forward, McKay right behind.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the cave to find Harmony roasting a
     bird over a spit. Sheppard rushes over to her and
     smothers the fire by kicking dirt over it.

  HARMONY
     (surprised) John! How did you find me!

  SHEPPARD
     We could smell your fire a mile away.

  HARMONY
     That's okay. I was finished cooking anyway.

  MCKAY
     You ran away from us.

  HARMONY
     You didn't give me any choice!

  SHEPPARD
     We've been out there searching for over an hour.
     We almost were caught twice.

  HARMONY
     Yes, it's very dangerous out there right now.
     That's why I decided to seek refuge in this cave
     and make camp.

  MCKAY
     You...made all this?

  HARMONY
     Yes. And caught a Loden bird. They're quite
     delicious.

  MCKAY
     How?

  ANNOTATION
     She sets her jaw and holds up her pocket knife.

  MCKAY
     (incredulous) You made all this with that?

  HARMONY
     I told you, I completed three sessions with Nolar
     Lumsbred.

  MCKAY
     What, and they covered all this in three sessions?

  HARMONY
     (annoyed) I am a quick learner! Do you not listen?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay and Sheppard exchange exasperated sighs.
     Harmony looks to Sheppard and notices his
     expression.

  HARMONY
     (hurt, to Sheppard) You're mad at me.

  SHEPPARD
     (sternly) Mm-hmm.

  HARMONY
     (half to herself) Our first fight. I knew it would
     happen eventually. We'll laugh about this one day.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange disturbed looks.

  SHEPPARD
     (diplomatically) I'm sure we will, but we got to
     get moving.

  MCKAY
     Right after we've eaten the Loden bird.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard glares at him.

  MCKAY
     ...or not.

  ANNOTATION
     A loud growl can be heard outside the cave.

  MCKAY
     That sounded very, very close. Are we sure this
     isn't the beast's cave?

  HARMONY
     You're so ignorant! The beast doesn't live in
     caves. We should stay here until the coast is
     clear.

  SHEPPARD
     All right. Half-hour, tops.

  HARMONY
     (grinning) Good. I'm hungry.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes the bird off the spit. McKay crouches
     anxiously beside her.

  MCKAY
     Okay.


LOCATION--CAVE ENTRANCE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony walks out to where Sheppard guards the
     cave entrance.

  HARMONY
     I brought you the bird's heart. My people believes
     it you great luck once consumed.

  ANNOTATION
     She holds out a small organ in her palm. Sheppard
     tries unsuccessfully to hide his disgust.

  SHEPPARD
     Thanks, but no thanks.

  HARMONY
     (puzzled) You're sure?

  SHEPPARD
     Pretty sure, yeah.

  HARMONY
     (shrugging) Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     She pops the heart into her own mouth and chews.

  HARMONY
     Are you still mad at me?

  SHEPPARD
     No, I'm over it.

  HARMONY
     That's good. I don't like it when you're mad at
     me.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, don't give me reason to be mad.

  HARMONY
     Very well.

  SHEPPARD
     So, you're thirteen, huh?

  HARMONY
     I will be fourteen in five lunar cycles.

  SHEPPARD
     Right. Nervous about being queen?

  HARMONY
     No. Why would I be?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, it's a lot of responsibility.

  HARMONY
     (softer) I know that.

  SHEPPARD
     You've got to put the needs of your people before
     anything else--including your own.

  HARMONY
     (considering) Some of the time, yes.

  SHEPPARD
     No, pretty much all of the time.

  HARMONY
     I'm sure I will strike a proper balance.

  SHEPPARD
     Just remember, you're not queen because of divine
     right; you're queen because they allow you to be
     queen. If you're mean to the people, they may
     change their minds. Just remember that.

  HARMONY
     (musing) You know much about leadership, John.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, hard-earned lessons along the way.

  HARMONY
     And...I know much about my people.

  SHEPPARD
     I hope so.

  HARMONY
     I think we would make a good team.

  SHEPPARD
     (off-guard) Hmm?

  HARMONY
     As queen...I will one day need...a king...

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard licks his lips nervously.

  SHEPPARD
     (uncomfortable) Um...listen...Harmony...

  HARMONY
     There's no need to answer now. I know such an
     offer must be overwhelming. You shouldn't make
     your decision rashly.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, I-I'm pretty sure I know which way I'm
     leaning. Uh, you're a great little lady, it's just
     that--

  ANNOTATION
     The strange beast noise sounds again. In the
     distance, men scream and fire their weapons.
     Sheppard stands. McKay comes running from inside
     the cave.

  MCKAY
     (whispering) What the hell was that?!

  SHEPPARD
     The Genii just had a little run-in with the beast.
     (to Harmony) All right, be a brave girl and stay
     here with McKay.

  MCKAY
     Hey, hey, hey, how come I always get stuck being
     the babysitter.

  SHEPPARD
     You want to check out the beast?

  MCKAY
     No. No, I'm good here.

  SHEPPARD
     Thought so. Stay here.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard moves off. McKay crouches next to
     Harmony.


LOCATION--MARDOLA'S QUARTERS

  MARDOLA
     (into radio) This is Mardola. I want an update.
     What's taking so long?


LOCATION--FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation switches between Mardola's room
     and Teran's location.

  ANNOTATION
     Teran leads a squad of Genii through the forest.

  TERAN
     I have men all along the path to the ruins.
     They've gone another way.

  MARDOLA
     (scornful) Well, obviously. They're not idiots!
     You should be looking everywhere but the path to
     the ruins!

  TERAN
     I am, but it's night, and this forest is vast and
     dense. My men are spread thin.

  MARDOLA
     What if they make it back to the village? There's
     no way that I could save relations between our two
     peoples then.

  TERAN
     We've just lost contact with some of my men. We're
     heading to their last known coordinates. Maybe
     we'll get lucky. Teran out.

  ANNOTATION
     Mardola sighs and slams down her radio.


LOCATION--CAVE ENTRANCE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony and McKay exchange looks as they remain at
     the cave entrance.

  HARMONY
     You're a doctor, right?

  MCKAY
     Yes. Yes, I-I mean, I'm not a medical doctor--

  HARMONY
     So you're a liar.

  MCKAY
     (insulted) No, I'm a-- (takes a deep breath and
     calms down) What do you want?

  HARMONY
     What does love feel like?

  MCKAY
     (rolling his eyes) Oh, boy...

  HARMONY
     Because I think I'm in love with John.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well it wouldn't be the first time, and I'm
     sure it won't be the last.

  HARMONY
     What does that mean?

  MCKAY
     It means that a lot of people, particularly alien
     women, tend to fall for John Sheppard's good looks
     and charm.

  HARMONY
     Not like me they don't.

  MCKAY
     He's a bit old for you, don't you think?

  HARMONY
     I hadn't considered it.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, well he will, so don't get your hopes up.

  HARMONY
     You're not going to try and influence him, are
     you?

  MCKAY
     I won't need to, trust me.

  HARMONY
     You don't like me very much, do you?

  MCKAY
     (squirming) No, that's not true. I...I don't not
     like you.

  HARMONY
     What does that mean?

  MCKAY
     It means that you have a very annoying attitude,
     but I'm willing to cut you some slack because
     you're still just a child.

  HARMONY
     Whereas, if I were grown up, my annoying attitude
     would be less excusable?

  MCKAY
     That's right. An adult would, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay suddenly realizes Harmony's leading comment
     and looks down to see her giving him an expectant
     look.

  MCKAY
     Hey! I don't have an attitude problem!

  HARMONY
     And I don't not like you.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay opens his mouth to retort, then processes
     what Harmony just says.

  MCKAY
     Well, that's sweet of you to say.

  HARMONY
     So, you promise not to get between John and me?

  MCKAY
     I promise. And I'll give you this, you're a lot
     more mature than the women he usually falls for.

  HARMONY
     Thank you, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up and goes back into the cave.


LOCATION-- FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard comes across the bodies of two Genii
     soldiers. He rushes forward.

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) McKay?

  MCKAY
     (over radio) What do you got?

  SHEPPARD
     (into radio) Two dead Genii. It's not pretty.
     Multiple puncture wounds.


LOCATION--CAVE ENTRANCE, NIGHT

  MCKAY
     (worried, into radio) You mean like teeth marks?


LOCATION--FOREST, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of conversation switches between McKay's
     and Sheppard's locations.

  SHEPPARD
     I don't think so.

  MCKAY
     So...so...what? Claws? Talons? A very sharp beak?

  SHEPPARD
     I don't know. It's not like anything I've ever
     seen before.

  ANNOTATION
     He hears rustling in the distance and quickly
     hides. Teran and his squad arrive.

  GENII SOLDIER 2
     Over here.

  ANNOTATION
     He crouches by the bodies.

  GENII SOLDIER 2
     What kind of creature could do this?

  TERAN
     It doesn't matter. We don't leave this forest
     until all three of them are dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, in hiding, has heard all this.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard arrives. McKay follows him into the cave.

  MCKAY
     What took you so long? I thought for sure we'D
     lost you!

  SHEPPARD
     I ran into Genii. I had to lie low until it was
     safe to move.

  MCKAY
     So what happened?

  SHEPPARD
     I don't know, but whatever that beast thing is,
     it's lethal.

  HARMONY
     I could've told you that.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah...also, the Genii have shoot-to-kill orders
     for all of us.

  MCKAY
     (rolling his eyes) Oh. Super.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard grabs Harmony by the arm and drags her
     with him.

  SHEPPARD
     All right, Princess, let's move.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay picks up their camp lantern and follows.


LOCATION--CAVE ENTRANCE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard starts heading down a path. Harmony stops
     short.

  HARMONY
     Wait!

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  HARMONY
     Where are you going?

  SHEPPARD
     Where does it look like? We're going back to the
     settlement.

  HARMONY
     (whining) But...we're so close to the ruins. And
     it's almost daybreak.

  SHEPPARD
     Look the fact that it's almost daybreak is a bad
     thing; we need the cover of night.

  HARMONY
     I can't come this far and just turn back. I
     refuse!

  ANNOTATION
     She crosses her arms stubbornly. McKay gives
     Sheppard a pointed look and points to the pack on
     his back.

  MCKAY
     You know, I still have the "unner-stay".

  SHEPPARD
     Harmony, the best thing you could do is go that
     way.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard points to the direction he wants to head.
     The beast growls nearby, close to that position.

  SHEPPARD
     (nervously) That sounded a little weird.

  MCKAY
     Hating to agree with the child, but, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     McKay points towards the ruins. Sheppard reaches
     back and snatches the map from Harmony.

  SHEPPARD
     Give me that.

  ANNOTATION
     He studies the map.

  HARMONY
     (confidently) The beast will avoid the ruins.
     We'll be safe there.

  MCKAY
     (to Sheppard) How far are they?

  SHEPPARD
     A half-hour or so.

  MCKAY
     So whaddya say?

  SHEPPARD
     Well, it's better than running into the beast.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts heading towards the ruins. McKay herds a
     delighted Harmony after him.


LOCATION--PLANET, DAWN


LOCATION--TEMPLE OF LAROS RUINS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, McKay and Harmony arrive at a slight
     incline overlooking the ruins.

  SHEPPARD
     (fierce whisper) Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard signals for them to get down; they take
     cover behind a large log and look below. A Genii
     is visible below at the site. McKay starts
     rummaging in his back for the stunner.

  SHEPPARD
     I was afraid of this.

  HARMONY
     (outraged) That's sacred ground. How dare he!

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to rise and confront the soldier, but
     Sheppard pulls her back down.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa! We'll handle this, all
     right?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay has found the scanner and squints to try and
     steady his aim.

  MCKAY
     Um...

  SHEPPARD
     I'll do that.

  MCKAY
     I got it. It's okay.

  SHEPPARD
     No really, j-just...

  SHEPPARD
     ...Steady...Come to papa...Let's go...

  ANNOTATION
     In one fell swoop, Sheppard snatches the gun from
     McKay and shoots the guard. He falls. Harmony gets
     up to approach, but Sheppard pulls her back down.

  SHEPPARD
     Hey, hey!

  HARMONY
     What?!

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony, staring at Sheppard, does not notice the
     second Genii soldier coming into view, looking
     confusedly down at his comrade.

  HARMONY
     You have subdued him.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stuns the second guard before he can
     defend himself.

  SHEPPARD
     Now we can go.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay hurry down. Harmony stands and
     smiles, then follows.

  ANNOTATION
     At the ruins, McKay stares at the pillar of the
     "Temple" in wonder. Sheppard goes to disarm the
     guards.

  MCKAY
     Fascinating!

  SHEPPARD
     Ancient?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay pulls out his scanner to check the pillar. A
     crystal panel is open; the first stunned Genii had
     been working on the device.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, obviously. It's weird. This place seems
     strangely familiar.

  HARMONY
     It's even more beautiful than I imagined.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony goes to a small pedestal in front of the
     pillar and pulls out a pendant. Clutching the
     stone, she places her hand on the pedestal. After
     a moment, she stares at her necklace worriedly.

  HARMONY
     Something's wrong.

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  HARMONY
     It's not working!

  SHEPPARD
     Shouldn't you be...like...silently meditating or
     something?

  HARMONY
     (disappointed) My pendant. It's supposed to glow.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange looks.

  MCKAY
     Well, I'll be damned.

  ANNOTATION
     He hurries over to Harmony with his scanner.

  SHEPPARD
     Let me guess...

  MCKAY
     Oh, yeah. It's Ancient.

  HARMONY
     It's the Pendant of Laros. The queen, and only the
     true queen, must return it to the ruins. Once
     here, it is to glow and imbue me with great power!

  SHEPPARD
     Your sisters kind of failed to mention that.

  HARMONY
     It is one of our greatest secrets.

  MCKAY
     (inspired) It's the testing ground!

  SHEPPARD
     What?

  MCKAY
     (excited) I know what this place is! I've been
     reading about it. Hell, we've been looking for it
     for the last two years! I-I've seen the
     schematics.

  SHEPPARD
     Share with the class..?

  MCKAY
     Well, believe it or not, this place actually does
     control the beast--if the beast is what I think it
     is.

  SHEPPARD
     Which is?

  MCKAY
     Mini-drones if I'm right; and you know, you can
     usually take that to the bank. I mean, this planet
     must have been where the Ancients first developed
     drone technology. It was their main testing
     ground!

  SHEPPARD
     That would explain why the Genii looked like Swiss
     cheese. The mini-drones went right through 'em!

  MCKAY
     And that noise the beast was making? It was more
     like an electric swarm than a--than a growl.

  SHEPPARD
     So the pendant is, uh...

  MCKAY
     Probably some sort of pass-key. I mean, the
     Ancient's weren't above protecting their research,
     even from each other. Look, you need more than
     just the gene in order to activate or control the
     drones, otherwise...

  ANNOTATION
     To Harmony's alarm, McKay shoves her hand off the
     pedestal. He studies the pedestal.

  MCKAY
     ...Yes, yes, yes, yes. Of course! It's in
     auto-protect mode. They're trolling the forest,
     taking out anybody without the gene. That's why
     they...stayed clear of us and went straight for
     the Genii. Look, the...royal pain here must have
     it as well.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony stares bemusedly at McKay.

  SHEPPARD
     Then why isn't it working?

  MCKAY
     (indicating the downed Genii) Well, maybe because
     genius over there was messing with the crystal
     tray?

  SHEPPARD
     All right. So?

  MCKAY
     Well, so, give me a second to figure out how much
     damage he's done.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts adjusting the crystals and working
     his scanner. Harmony closes her eyes and furrows
     her face in intense concentration while she holds
     the pedestal. Sheppard approaches her.

  SHEPPARD
     The machine is...broken; that's why your pendant
     isn't glowing.

  HARMONY
     (upset) It's got nothing to do with machines. If I
     am worthy of being queen, the gods will bestow the
     power of pure light and make my pendant glow!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard looks to McKay.

  MCKAY
     Well, who knows what kind of wacky rules they've
     imposed on it. I mean, I suppose it's possible
     that once a generation, the key needs to be
     reactivated here. Maybe it's the one thing that,
     uh, allows them to use the Ancient tech they have
     back at the castle.

  SHEPPARD
     It-it's complicated, but it-it will light up. We
     just need to make some...repairs.

  HARMONY
     You don't understand. I've failed. Maybe I'm not
     supposed to be queen. Maybe...maybe we've come all
     this way for nothing.

  SHEPPARD
     Trust me, it-it'll glow.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony turns away and sits on the Temple floor,
     clutching her pendant and moping. Sheppard heads
     over to the Genii soldiers, who are starting to
     stir. Sheppard nudges one with his boot, holding
     his gun on them.

  SHEPPARD
     Wake up. What'd you do to this thing?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay joins them.

  GENII SCIENTIST
     (scared) I'm not sure. I just rearranged the
     crystals.

  HURON
     Don't tell them a thing. They're going to kill us
     one way or the other.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange looks.

  SHEPPARD
     Can you get it to work?

  MCKAY
     Not quickly. I mean, I can come back with a jumper
     and a small team and get it working.

  ANNOTATION
     While McKay guards the men, Sheppard rejoins to
     Harmony.

  SHEPPARD
     Listen...we're going to head back--

  HARMONY
     No! If I return with a darkened pendant, I won't
     be allowed to--

  SHEPPARD
     (interrupting) Yes, you will be queen, I promise
     you! It's just busted.

  HARMONY
     This isn't the type of thing where you get a
     second chance, John. Please. I can do it. I just-I
     just need to focus more.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes back to the pedestal and desperately
     attempts to activate it again.

  TERAN
     (distantly over radio) Huron...

  ANNOTATION
     Huron reaches for his radio, but Sheppard is
     instantly there, pointing the stunner.

  SHEPPARD
     Whoa! Easy does it.

  ANNOTATION
     Huron slowly passes the radio over to Sheppard.

  TERAN
     (over radio) Huron come in...Huron, come in.

  MCKAY
     If we don't respond, they're going to come and
     investigate.

  SHEPPARD
     (with deeper voice, into Genii radio) Huron here.

  TERAN
     (over radio) What's your status.

  SHEPPARD
     (with deep voice, into radio) Good.

  TERAN
     (over radio) Elaborate.

  SHEPPARD
     (with deep voice, into radio) Real good.

  HURON
     (crying out) Help us!

  GENII SCIENTIST
     Help us!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard stuns them both.

  TERAN
     (over radio) Huron!

  SHEPPARD
     (regular voice, into radio, quickly) Kinda busy,
     gotta go.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns off the radio.

  SHEPPARD
     Well it was worth a shot. You gotta get that thing
     working, fast!

  MCKAY
     Why can't we just run for it?

  SHEPPARD
     We're boxed in from all directions! We've gotta
     get those mini drones working, or...

  MCKAY
     (scared) Or we die.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony desperately tries to get her pendant to
     work.


LOCATION--FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Genii run towards the ruins.


LOCATION--TEMPLE OF LAROS RUINS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     McKay works on the crystal control panel.

  MCKAY
     (calling to Sheppard) You know, you're not exactly
     inspiring confidence.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard looks up from the fallen stone pillar
     where he's taken a protected position with his
     weapon.

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah? How so?

  MCKAY
     You're hiding behind a foot of solid rock. How am
     I supposed to feel out here with only a cool
     breeze between me and the Genii?

  SHEPPARD
     You're more than welcome to come and get cover for
     yourself...as soon as you're done with those
     repairs.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony is settled beside Sheppard, well
     protected.

  MCKAY
     (irked) Do you have any idea how many crystal
     placement combinations there are?!

  SHEPPARD
     More than seven?

  MCKAY
     Try seven thousand!

  SHEPPARD
     Well, that's less than infinite.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's scanner beeps, and he sighs in
     frustration.

  SHEPPARD
     (to Harmony) All right, look. It's going to get
     very, very noisy when the Genii get here.

  HARMONY
     Screaming?

  SHEPPARD
     (taps his rifle) No, these guns. They make a lot
     of noise. It's very important that you stay put
     and keep your ears covered, okay?

  HARMONY
     Shouldn't you give me a gun instead?

  SHEPPARD
     (sternly) You're going to stay put, cover your
     ears, and you're not gonna move, okay?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay's scanner beeps and the Ancient pillar gives
     off a steady hum.

  MCKAY
     (triumphant) Son of a bitch! I think I got it!

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony rushes out to the pedestal.

  SHEPPARD
     Harm--Harmony! What did I just say?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to go after her just as gunfire strafes
     the area. McKay ducks as bullets strike the pillar
     near his head. Sheppard pauses and returns fire.
     McKay dives for cover, knocking Harmony to the
     ground under him.

  ANNOTATION
     The Genii take positions around the temple. McKay
     looks up to see Harmony's frightened face staring
     at him.

  MCKAY
     Go! Go, go, go go!

  ANNOTATION
     He shoves Harmony back towards the protection of
     the fallen pillar while he provides cover fire,
     then follows her. Sheppard and the Genii continue
     to exchange fire as McKay takes a position behind
     the rock. The gunfire stops.

  TERAN
     (calling to them) You're surrounded! You have
     limited ammunition, and I have unlimited men.

  SHEPPARD
     We'll take our chances.

  TERAN
     If you make this hard, I will make your death as
     slow and as painful as possible.

  SHEPPARD
     Okay...what's option number two?

  TERAN
     Give us the girl, and we'll let you go free.

  HARMONY
     Never! They would rather die than deal with the
     likes of you savages! When my sisters hear of
     this, the Genii will be finished! Finished, do you
     hear!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay roll their eyes.

  TERAN
     How do you think we knew how to find you little
     one?

  HARMONY
     You lie! Come at us with all you have! I shall
     silence you once and for all!

  SHEPPARD
     (hissing to Harmony) Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Let us
     handle this, okay?

  ANNOTATION
     Teran pauses, but hears nothing more.

  TERAN
     You have one minute!

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard, McKay, and Harmony congregate, all
     speaking low.

  HARMONY
     It can't be true!

  SHEPPARD
     It doesn't matter right now, to be honest.

  HARMONY
     How can you say that?

  SHEPPARD
     (to McKay) Did you get that thing working?

  MCKAY
     Well yeah, before they started shooting at it.

  SHEPPARD
     So it's broken again?

  MCKAY
     Well, it was powered up. Fifty-fifty chance it's
     still operational.

  HARMONY
     Provide me with cover. I'll make it to the
     pedestal, summon the beast, and smite them.

  SHEPPARD
     (annoyed) There will be no "smiting" today, little
     lady. You've never even used that thing before.

  HARMONY
     I am the queen, and the beast is my protector!

  SHEPPARD
     It's a little more complicated than that.

  ANNOTATION
     He pauses, struck by a thought.

  SHEPPARD
     (to McKay, shrewdly) You say anyone with the
     Ancient gene can activate it?

  MCKAY
     Yeah, as long as they're wearing the...pendant.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks from Sheppard to Harmony, following
     Sheppard's thought. Harmony remains oblivious.

  HARMONY
     Exactly.

  SHEPPARD
     Fifty-fifty, huh?

  MCKAY
     One hundred percent chance they'll kill us if we
     talk about it for much longer.

  SHEPPARD
     (sighing) You got a full mag there?

  ANNOTATION
     McKay checks his weapon.

  MCKAY
     Locked and loaded.

  SHEPPARD
     On three?

  MCKAY
     (nervously) Okay.

  HARMONY
     Yes. Excellent.

  SHEPPARD
     One...two...three.

  ANNOTATION
     He snatches the pendant off Harmony's neck as he
     says three and runs for the pedestal. McKay
     provides cover fire. Harmony gasps in shock.
     Sheppard activates the pedestal, the pendant in
     his hand. Mini-drones swarm the area. The Genii
     cease fire as they warily stare at the humming
     drones flying everywhere. Teran stares at the
     drones, but sees Sheppard standing in the open.

  TERAN
     What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

  ANNOTATION
     His men are too distracted by the drones. Teran
     raises his pistol, and Sheppard sees him; he
     directs the mini-drones to attack. The drones
     knock Teran down, killing him. The other Genii
     flee. Sheppard powers down the pedestal. McKay and
     Harmony run over.

  MCKAY
     You all right?

  SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I'm good. You?

  MCKAY
     Sure, sure.

  HARMONY
     (in awe) That was the bravest thing I've ever
     seen.

  SHEPPARD
     (cocky) You're young. I'm sure you'll meet even
     braver men than me as you get older.

  ANNOTATION
     Harmony snatches back her pendant.

  HARMONY
     (furious) Not you, usurper! You're lucky I like
     you, or you would be hung for treason! (to McKay)
     But you...you saved my life.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay both look stunned at this
     change in Harmony.

  MCKAY
     (nonplussed) I did?

  HARMONY
     When the Genii started firing at me, you threw
     yourself on me, using your own body as a shield.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard makes a face and walks away.

  MCKAY
     (stammering) Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I just-I
     tripped and...fell on top of you. It was an
     accident.

  HARMONY
     And then...you pulled me to safety.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay opens his mouth, and closes it, eyes still
     wide as he fidgets uncomfortably.

  HARMONY
     You don't...don't not like me. You like me!

  MCKAY
     (worried) No. No, no, no. I'm...

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Sheppard for help, who just shrugs.

  HARMONY
     Yes! You saved my life and restored the ruins. You
     are a hero, Doctor McKay, both to me and my
     people.

  MCKAY
     (preening with false modesty) Well, I don't know
     about "hero"...I mean, exceptionally courageous,
     perhaps.

  HARMONY
     And modest, too.

  SHEPPARD
     (piqued) It's time to go, before the Genii come
     back.

  HARMONY
     I doubt it. They are a simple people, and I'm sure
     they were most impressed by your actions. I,
     however, was not.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange looks. Harmony places
     her hand on the pedestal. It activates.

  HARMONY
     (pleased) The pendant still glows. The gods have
     deemed me worthy. Now, we can go.

  ANNOTATION
     She stalks off, McKay and Sheppard roll their eyes
     and follow.


LOCATION--CASTLE, DAY


LOCATION--MARDOLA'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Mardola reads at her table. The door slams open
     and guards, followed by Harmony and Flora enter.
     Mardola stands, smiling.

  MARDOLA
     (to Harmony) You've returned!

  ANNOTATION
     The door shuts, and the guards start to search the
     room. Mardola looks at them worriedly.

  MARDOLA
     (to guards) What are you doing? These are my
     private quarters!

  FLORA
     It's all right, Mardola. They've already searched
     my room. You should allow it.

  MARDOLA
     (angry) Why?!

  HARMONY
     The Genii attacked us.

  MARDOLA
     Oh...well, it was a good thing Colonel Sheppard
     was there to protect you.

  FLORA
     They knew the location of the ruins, Mardola. How?

  MARDOLA
     You ask as if I would know.

  ANNOTATION
     A guard places the Genii radio he found in
     Mardola's dresser on the table in front of them.
     Mardola's eyes widen in fear, and she looks back
     at Harmony, who's staring at her, hurt and
     betrayed.

  MARDOLA
     You're too young to be queen, Harmony!

  HARMONY
     (coldly) Perhaps...but when you're released from
     prison, you'll be too old to remember.


LOCATION--THRONE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The court is full of people. McKay and Sheppard
     stand at a red carpet in front of Harmony's
     throne. Harmony is dressed in a fancy gown with a
     crown on her head. Flora stands on the lowest
     tier, to the right of the throne.

  HARMONY
     Doctor Rodney McKay and Colonel John Sheppard.
     Your contribution to my people may never be
     repaid.

  SHEPPARD
     Well, we didn't do it for compensation, Your
     Highness-ness.

  MCKAY
     (under his breath) Kiss-ass.

  HARMONY
     I personally owe you a debt of gratitude for your
     help defeating the regicidal Genii. I've had one
     of the court's finest artisans feature you in a
     rendering of our glorious victory.

  ANNOTATION
     Sheppard and McKay exchange pleased looks. Harmony
     steps towards a curtain behind the throne and
     nods. Servants pull off the curtain. The court
     applaud as a large painting is revealed. It
     pictures McKay in the foreground firing his
     weapon; Harmony stands in the center, her hand on
     the temple pedestal, a halo from the beast glowing
     around her; Sheppard cowers in fright behind
     Harmony.

  MCKAY
     Yeah, pretty much how I remember it.

  ANNOTATION
     McKay starts to clap as well as Sheppard looks
     stunned. Harmony grins.
