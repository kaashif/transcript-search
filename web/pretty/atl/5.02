<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>TEYLA: Today, he's decided that he will only sleep as long as I hold him, and keep moving. I've already walked half the city and back again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>KELLER: My parents used to put me in the car. My dad would have to drive around and round and round the block at three o'clock in the morning.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>KELLER: Mm-hmm. I walked in on him once by accident, and he pretended like he was "checking the system" or something.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>RONON: I don't get it. I thought Colonel Carter was doing a good job.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>TEYLA: I agree. We defeated the Replicators; we thwarted Michael's plans; and the Wraith are in a state of disarray. All of this happened while she was leader of Atlantis.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>TEYLA: He is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. If there is even a chance that he is still alive, me must continue the search.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>WOOLSEY: I'm sorry. But I can't devote the resources of this base to the never-ending pursuit of a single individual across an entire galaxy.

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>KELLER: Uh, right, uh...well, um, we've had some success using a slightly modified version of the original retrovirus that created Michael in the first place. It weeds out the Wraith DNA, and allows them to resume their original human form over time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L117"><td><a href="#L117">117</a></td><td>WOOLSEY: (firmly) No. We'll keep them there until I'm satisfied that they can be trusted. Now...regarding the situation with our friend in the stasis pod. You seem to have been giving a significant amount of attention to this lately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L118"><td><a href="#L118">118</a></td><td>KELLER: Well, once we got our hands on Michael's medical research, I thought I should make it a priority to look for a solution.</td></tr>

<tr id="L120"><td><a href="#L120">120</a></td><td>KELLER: (pleased) Maybe. We found a serum that, in lab tests at least, seems to be capable of stabilizing the clone cells.</td></tr>

<tr id="L123"><td><a href="#L123">123</a></td><td>KELLER: Carson was near death when we put him in that chamber. I don't want to take him out until I know for sure. But, lab tests can only do so much.</td></tr>

<tr id="L124"><td><a href="#L124">124</a></td><td>WOOLSEY: But that problem's never going to go away, is it? If you've reached the limit of what your research can tell you, then you need to make a decision. Either proceed, or put the matter aside and get back to your regular duty. Right?</td></tr>
