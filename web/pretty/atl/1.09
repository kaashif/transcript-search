<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>SHEPPARD: You talked me into coming here because you thought those energy readings indicated the presence of a civilization. There are no buildings, no people, no nothing. Just fog.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>MCKAY: It's not technically fog. There's no actual water vapor in the atmosphere. I mean, you know, for that matter, I don't think we need to wear the hazmat gear.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>MCKAY: When the wormhole connected, there was a wild fluctuation in the energy field. I mean, if I'm reading these numbers right, it looks like the gate is actually drawing power from the atmosphere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>MCKAY: It is, but that's because it's the only one with an additional control crystal that allows the eighth chevron to lock.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>MCKAY: It doesn't matter. As long as we have the control crystal, I can make the other gate work.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>MCKAY: (becoming annoyed) I don't yet, but the fog, or the mist, or whatever you want to call it, is the only thing around for miles, and the energy readings were constant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>WEIR: Okay, even if you can pull this off, we have to assume that the Earth gate lacks a power source capable of establishing a wormhole back to Pegasus. So whoever went would be taking the risk that it might be a one-way trip.</td></tr>

Now, at the time, I just assumed that was an effect of the gate's residual energy signature. But having given it some thought, I realized that can't account for such sizable variances, which leaves only one possible explanation. The gate must have been energized on our arrival, meaning it doesn't just draw power on outgoing wormholes, but on incoming wormholes as well. All we have to do is make a connection. 3.5 microseconds, that's the minimal amount of time it requires to confirm a lock before the gate automatically kicks in, drawing power from the atmosphere to maintain the wormhole.</td></tr>
