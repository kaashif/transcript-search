<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>RIKER:  It was a first contact situation. Ghorusdan culture is so complex and different, that the Federation sent a specialist to prevent misunderstanding.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  So that was Tam Elbrun. What happened was his fault?</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>RIKER:  Not directly. Board of inquiry blamed Darson for carelessness about Ghorusdan cultural taboos. But if Elbrun was so good, why didn't he warn Darson? What was he doing there if he couldn't sense that much hostility?</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>DATA:  Our orders are to proceed to this star, Beta Stromgren. Scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of an alternating cycle of expansion and collapse, and will soon result in a supernova. However, the unmanned long range space probe sent by Starfleet to observe the process has discovered something much more.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>TAM:  Oh, Data don't waste time. They call it Tin Man. The Vega probe found it orbiting Stromgren.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Looks like some kind of ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>TAM:  Its energy source is unknown. The people who've studied the transmissions think it's a starship. And they're sure it's alive.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>PICARD:  Alive? How?</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  A cybernetic organism like the Borg?</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>TAM:  No, no, no. Here. Starfleet believes it's an organic creature, born in space, living its life in the wastes between stars. No one knows where it came from, or why it's here. But we're going to meet it. We're going to talk to it. I'm going to talk to it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>RIKER:  Have attempts been made</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>TAM:  To communicate with it by subspace. Of course. Linguacode, universal translation, all that. It won't work. Tin Man is too different. Direct mind to mind contact is our only hope.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>TROI:  The opportunity for discovery is extraordinary but I don't understand Starfleet's urgency.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>PICARD:  Romulans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>TAM:  Hell, I forgot. The Romulans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>PICARD:  They claim that sector of space where Beta Stromgren is located.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>DATA:  They routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep space probes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>PICARD:  Then they will certainly be sending a ship of their own to investigate this Tin Man.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>DATA:  That is correct. Starbase one two three has detected two D'daridex class cruisers on an intercept course. The top speed of this class cruiser is known to be less than ours. Therefore we do have some advantage.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>PICARD:  Then, it's a race? An alien intelligence, a new life form, representing a technology far beyond that of either the Romulans or ourselves. The Romulans will certainly take whatever measures are required to secure this creature for study.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Study as in dissecting, I'd bet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>PICARD:  Mister Data, you are our resident honour student in exobiology. I'm assigning you to head up the Life Sciences on this mission.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>PICARD:  Mister Elbrun, one of the reasons I'm asking you to work closely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions. The possibility of an encounter with Romulans on this mission is hardly trivial. And yet</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>TAM:  All right, all right. I should have brought up the Romulans earlier, but I was distracted. And no, Billy boy, I wasn't distracted on Ghorusda. If Darson had listened to me, no one would have died. No? Well I don't care whether you believe that or not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>SOMEONE: Captain's log, supplemental. Travelling at high warp, we are still several days from rendezvous with the mysterious entity which Starfleet has christened Tin Man. My immediate concern is with Tam Elbrun. Starfleet considers his unique abilities crucial to our mission, yet he seems to me unstable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>TROI:  No. Except for some reason that no one understands, occasionally a Betazoid child is born different.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  The noise of other people's thoughts and feelings must be overwhelming, incomprehensible, especially to a child.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>TROI:  And painful. Early diagnosis and special training did help Tam adjust, but he has some problems.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>PICARD:  Yes, well, he's evidently done more than hold together. He's the indispensable man. The Federation's finest specialist in communication with unknown life forms.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  The more unusual a life form is, the better he likes it. His personnel file shows that he's gravitated toward assignments that isolate him from other humanoids.</td></tr>
