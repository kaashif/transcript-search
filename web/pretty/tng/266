<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a healer, but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve pain and fight illness. She knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy body. Her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal teas, and often they were just as bitter tasting. I will miss Felisa Howard very much. Her healing, her advice, and most of all, the inspiration she has provided me throughout the years. Rest in peace, Nana.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>MATURIN:  (not human) And so now we commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope that her memory will be kept alive within us all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  It was a very personal gesture, and he gave me a remarkable look. Well, I guess I should be going back to the house. There are some things I need to do. It's only a few minutes from here. Would you mind coming along?</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>MATURIN:  Well, as you know, Caldos is one of the first terraforming projects of the Federation. Our weather controls and fusion systems are nearly a century old. I wouldn't mind having a starship Engineer take a look at them. Perhaps give us a few upgrades. Maybe in exchange for a tour of the colony and a home-cooked meal?</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>PICARD:  I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressive accomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>MATURIN:  That was the intent. The cornerstone of every building in town was brought from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen. The founders wanted everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here. They didn't want to just imitate Scotland, they wanted to recreate it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>PICARD:  Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scots yourself. What was it that drew you here?</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>MATURIN:  Something about the culture, the heritage. When I was a boy, my family visited Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I looked out across the highlands, I felt as if I had come home.</td></tr>

And I think I saw him at the funeral. A handsome young man tossed a camellia onto her grave. But the strange thing is, she never mentioned him in her letters. Never once. And yet it appears they spent almost all their time together. It's as if she led an entire life that I knew nothing about.</td></tr>
