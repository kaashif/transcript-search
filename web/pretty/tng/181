<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>K'EHLEYR:  I won't bore you with the intricacies of Klingon politics. Basically, two factions are trying to seize power.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>K'EHLEYR:  Klingon wars seldom remain confined to the Empire. Sooner or later they'll drag in the neighbouring star systems, then the Tholians, the Ferengi. The Federation won't be able to stay out of it for long. This has been coming for some time. Only K'mpec, the head of the Council, has been able to maintain the peace.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>PICARD:  K'mpec, you cannot possibly be serious. A Federation officer has no business in</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>K'MPEC:  Nonsense. You are an accomplished mediator. This is no different than any other dispute requiring your services.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>PICARD:  On the contrary, I think this is very different. And I must respectfully decline.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>K'MPEC:  If you refuse the dying request of the Klingon Supreme Commander it will be a insult by the Federation to all Klingons. Besides, I've already sent the order to the leaders of the two opposing factions. They're on their way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>PICARD:  You had no right to involve me without my permission.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>K'MPEC:  If I'd asked, you would have said no.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>PICARD:  This is not a case of simple mediation. You are asking me to choose the next leader of the Klingon Empire.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>K'MPEC:  No. By tradition, the two strongest challengers fight for the right of succession. As mediator, only you can designate those challengers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>K'MPEC:  I want you to discover which one of them has killed me. Gowron or Duras. Yes, Duras. I thought you would find that interesting.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>PICARD:  Interesting? You could say that, since he tried to have me killed, and conspired to strip Worf of his good name.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>K'MPEC:  And I approved. All for the glory of the Empire. That should be my epitaph. Find the assassin. The Klingon who kills without showing his face has no honour. He must not lead the Empire. Such a man would be capable of anything. Even war with the Federation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>PICARD:  Very well. I accept.</td></tr>
