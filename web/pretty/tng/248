<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  That's why I went to the Altine Conference. I'd heard about a new subspace technology developed by a Ferengi, a Doctor Reyga.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Too bad you weren't there. Nobody else would listen to him. They all but jeered him off the stage. But I had read his paper and his work was extraordinary.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>GUINAN:  So you gathered all these scientists to come hear this Ferengi.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Yes. I hoped I could be a facilitator. I thought if I invited scientists from various cultures to board the Enterprise, I could sit them and down help them understand the value of his ideas.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Exactly. So, after persuading the Captain, I had to round up as many scientists as I could from the field of subspace technology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>CRUSHER [OC]:  But of all the scientists I invited, only four were interested in hearing about Doctor Reyga's invention. And I wasn't altogether sure they were going to be compatible. Kurak was a warp field specialist on the Klingon Homeworld. I don't think Klingons regard scientists very highly. She always seemed a little defensive. Doctor T'Pan is practically a legend in the field of subspace morphology. She's been the director of the Vulcan Science Academy for fifteen years. Her husband, Doctor Christopher, came with her. I didn't know much about him, but he was some kind of subspace theoretician. Jo'Bril was a Takaran, the first one I'd ever met. I had no idea what to expect from him. And then there was Doctor Reyga, the Ferengi scientist.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>REYGA:  You've all seen my experimental data. The metaphasic shield has been proven.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>T'PAN:  Forgive my scepticism, Doctor, but your claims are somewhat extravagant. Protect a shuttle within a star's corona? Not even your own government believes it can be done.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  That's why I've invited you all here. You have the vision to see the potential of Doctor Reyga's metaphasic shield.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>REYGA:  I need help to develop the shield. I am willing to grant exclusive rights to whoever provides the necessary resources.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  I think you all realise what this shielding process could mean. The possibilities of exploration and research are endless.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>KURAK:  But only if it works. I'm not convinced that this metaphasic shield can withstand either the temperature or the radiation it would be exposed to.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>REYGA:  But it has! Not only in countless simulations, but in a field test that I conducted myself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>KURAK:  For which, of course, we have only your word.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>REYGA:  Are you accusing me of falsifying my data?</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>KURAK:  You would not be the first scientist to manipulate experimental data to his own advantage.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Doctor Reyga has offered to demonstrate his invention. He's outfitted one of our shuttles with his metaphasic shield.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>REYGA:  I will take it into the corona of the star Vaytan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>CHRISTOPHER:  That star has a superdense corona. The shuttle would be subjected to particularly intense radiation. Perhaps it would be wise to choose a star of lesser magnitude.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>T'PAN:  I agree. My own research into solar energy transfer suggests that Vaytan's corona is extremely unstable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>REYGA:  What better way to test my invention? I'm not concerned. The shield will hold.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>KURAK:  I for one would feel more comfortable if someone else flew the shuttle. Someone more objective.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>JO'BRIL:  I will volunteer for that task. I've spent years studying solar plasma reactions. The thought of being able to penetrate a star's corona. It is a remarkable opportunity. I've studied your data, Doctor Reyga. I think you're on solid scientific ground.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>KURAK:  I do not share your optimism, Doctor Jo'Bril, but if you wish to pilot the craft, I would be more confident in your assessment of the shield than Doctor Reyga's.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>CHRISTOPHER:  I agree. At this point, we need an impartial evaluation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  We'll need to be sure that you're familiar with the shuttle's controls and Doctor Reyga's modifications.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Well, what do you think?</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>REYGA:  I am gratified, Doctor Jo'Bril. And there will be no difficulty in operating the metaphasic controls. The system will activate automatically as you approach the star.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Well, then. We'll proceed with the demonstration at fifteen hundred hours. We'll meet on the Bridge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>CRUSHER [OC]:  It wasn't exactly an enthusiastic response to Doctor Reyga's technology, but given the circumstances and the scientist's quarrelsome personalities, I was quite pleased.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  I thought that went well, didn't you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>REYGA:  Thanks to you, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Some of the scientists still seem a little doubtful, but after the demonstration I'm sure they'll come around.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>REYGA:  Well, if there's anything I'm used to, it's scepticism. After all, a Ferengi scientist is almost a contradiction in terms. No, don't deny it. I know how the Ferengi are regarded.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  I still expect the scientific community to be a little more open than they seem to be.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>REYGA:  The metaphasic shield is a breakthrough in technology. Many scientists have tried to develop it. It's only natural that there would be some resistance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  You mean jealousy. I know. I wondered if that might account for Doctor T'Pan's attitude. She's been working on subspace shielding technology for years and you've beaten her to the punch.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>REYGA:  I'm really not interested in competition. All I want is to be acknowledged. Respected as a scientist. This invention will finally do that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>CRUSHER [OC]:  I figured the hard part was over. I'd stepped out on a limb and it hadn't broken.</td></tr>
