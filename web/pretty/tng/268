<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Yes, it's a pre-industrial society, but the probe crashed over a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement so Data shouldn't have any contact with the Barkonians. So, how was the reunion?</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Oh, I don't know. I never even thought about my rank for a long time. It seemed pretty trivial compared to being a doctor. But then, about eight years ago, I started to feel like I wanted to stretch myself a little.</td></tr>
