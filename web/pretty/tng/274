<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>BOK:  I trust you remember me, Picard, because I haven't forgotten you or how you murdered my son. For fifteen years now I've thought about how to avenge his death but nothing I could do to you could equal what you did to me, until now. You thought you could hide him from me, didn't you? But I found out about him. Jason Vigo is as good as dead. I'm going to kill your son, Picard, just like you killed mine.</td></tr>

Mister Data, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federation records. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaul about fifty years ago.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>PICARD:  Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all you can about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained his rank, I want to know why.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>RIKER:  The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules of Acquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data found out that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is the most recent picture we could find.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>RIKER:  Twenty three. He and his mother left Earth twelve years ago. They settled on Camor Five. That's all we know. The planet's records are virtually non-existent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>PICARD:  Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>PICARD:  Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that you have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never managed to get together again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>RIKER:  She never said anything to you about being pregnant?</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>PICARD:  No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda decided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surprise me. She was very independent, very strong willed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>RIKER:  She would have to be to get by on Camor Five.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>PICARD:  But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried to kill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good his threat against the boy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>DATA:  That would significantly narrow our search. The only cultivated land is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few people engaged in agricultural activities.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>PICARD:  Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collected over the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. And this, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare.</td></tr>

I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would have liked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. You look a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like to make one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. If she had, I would have been part of your life.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>PICARD:  Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his son. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my son.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>DATA:  Bok took the precaution of encrypting the probe's navigational systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  We ran an analysis of the probe's hull.
