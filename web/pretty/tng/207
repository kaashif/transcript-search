<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>PICARD:  On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're in a position to compromise the security of the Federation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>PICARD:  And I will not return without a full explanation. Ambassador, with great respect for all that you've achieved on behalf of the Federation, this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be tolerated any more.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>SPOCK:  Cowboy diplomacy?</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>PICARD:  If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussions to the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'm here as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>SPOCK:  He was a great representative of the Vulcan people and of the Federation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>PICARD:  I was with him before coming here. He expressed his pride in you. His love.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>SPOCK:  Sarek would no more approve my coming here than you do, Picard. For some time now, I've been aware of a growing movement here of people who seek to learn the ideals of the Vulcan philosophy. They've been declared enemies of the state. But there are a few in the Romulan hierarchy like Pardek, who are sympathetic. He asked me to come now, because he believes it may be time to take the first step toward reunification.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>PICARD:  Reunification? After so many centuries? After so many fundamental differences have evolved between your peoples?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>SPOCK:  It would seem unlikely to succeed, but I cannot ignore the potential rewards that a union between our two worlds would bring.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>SPOCK:  There is a new Proconsul in the Romulan Senate. He is young and idealistic. He has promised many reforms. Pardek believes that he may be receptive to discussing reunification.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>SPOCK:  A personal decision, Captain. Perhaps you are aware of the small role I played in the overture to peace with the Klingons.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>SPOCK:  Not entirely. It was I who committed Captain Kirk to that peace mission, and I who had to bear the responsibility for the consequences to him and his crew. Quite simply, I am unwilling to risk anyone's life but my own on this occasion. So I ask you respect my wishes and leave.</td></tr>

In the Federation, we have learned from experience to view the Romulans with distrust. We can either choose to live with that enmity or seek an opportunity to change it. I choose the latter.</td></tr>

I am sure that is evident to you, Spock.</td></tr>
