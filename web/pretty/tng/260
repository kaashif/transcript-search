<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Are you worried about this mission with the Kes?</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>PICARD:  Not worried exactly. This notion of admitting half of their planet to the Federation while leaving the other half out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  First of all, the Kes are not half the planet, they're nearly three quarters of it. And the Prytt are not being left out. They themselves simply don't want to have contact with anyone from the outside. not the Federation or anyone else.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>PICARD:  Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world, and that unity said something about them. That they had resolved certain social and political differences and they were now ready to become part a larger community.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>MAURIC:  I don't believe there is any diplomatic option, Commander. We have no formal relations with the Prytt. No ambassadors. There's simply no way to contact them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>MAURIC:  Allow me to be blunt. The Prytt are a fanatical, xenophobic people, with little regard for civilised discourse. Even if you do establish communications link with them, it will be a complete waste of time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>RIKER:  With all due respect, Ambassador, I think I should try to communicate with the Prytt before I sanction the use of force.</td></tr>

If anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation, which means more starships will be coming to Kesprytt and those ships are going to want answers which puts your country under a very large and very uncomfortable microscope. Remember how unhappy you were when we contacted just one of your people without authorisation? Well, just think of what it'll be like. Ten starships asking questions, contacting hundreds of your people. Massive sensor sweeps. They may even start sending down away teams. All because you wouldn't help me find my missing officers.</td></tr>
