You think perhaps it might be uncomfortable? But then again, you don't give a thought to comfort, do you. (to Varria) When Palor Toff learns of that, he'll swallow his tongue with envy.

<tr id="L312"><td><a href="#L312">312</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Data gets in the pod, Varria goes to a control station and presses buttons. The alarm sounds, a man runs in. She points the disrupter at him, then is jumped from behind by another crewman and disarmed. Man number one cancels the sequence while Data rescues Varria. Data ends up throwing both men across the bay. They go to start again, when Fajo enters. The disrupter is lying on the floor. Varria dives for it but lands short. Fajo aims another disrupter at her. For a moment, he starts to turn away, then fires. Varria screams for several seconds before she finally disintegrates. Data comes out of the pod</td></tr>

You will entertain me and you will entertain my guests. And if you do not, I will simply kill somebody else. Him, perhaps. It doesn't matter. Their blood will be on your hands too, just like poor Varria's. Your only alternative, Data, is to fire. Murder me. That's all you have to do. Go ahead. Fire. If only you could feel rage over Varria's death. If only you could feel the need for revenge, then maybe you could fire. But you're just an android. You can't feel anything, can you? It's just another interesting intellectual puzzle for you. Another of life's curiosities.</td></tr>
