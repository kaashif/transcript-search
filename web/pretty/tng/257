Any further objections should be given to me in private, not in front of the crew. I do not recall Commander Riker ever publicly showing irritation with his Captain as you did a moment ago.</td></tr>

This group advocates the total isolation of Vulcan from the rest of the galaxy and the eradication of all alien influences from our planet.</td></tr>

Only one piece is known to have survived and it was placed in a Vulcan museum under heavy guard. A year ago, that piece was stolen from the museum.

But I can see the symbol on that third artefact, and it is the Vulcan symbol for peace standing between the symbols for war and death.
