We prefer meeting like this, rather than a random confrontation in deep space.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>TROI:  We've come to you first because you're a leader in the scientific community. Scientists generally accept our arrival more easily than others.</td></tr>

When I was a child, my parents would take me to the planetarium and we would sit in the dark and it was as if I was on a spaceship, on my way to another world to meet people on other planets. Part of me keeps waiting for the lights to come up and the programme to end. How did you know about me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>MIRASTA:  We must find him before someone realises what he really is. If this gets out prematurely, it could seriously complicate matters. Our ideology is based on the assumption that the Malcorian is a supreme lifeform, and our world is the centre of the universe. Your arrival will change our entire understanding of life, and some will not want it to change.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>MIRASTA:  Captain Picard, I must ask you to trust me on this. If you tell the Chancellor about Commander Riker, you will undermine everything that you hope to accomplish here. Durken will assign Krola, our Minister of Security, to find him. Krola has his own political agenda. He will perceive you as the greatest threat that our people have ever known. And he will not hesitate to use Riker to prove that he is correct.</td></tr>
