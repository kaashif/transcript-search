<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Exactly, but, you've got them all memorised. The first time someone opens their mouth, you've got it solved, so there's really no mystery. If there's no mystery, there's no game. No game, no fun. I'm not upset with you, Data, really. It's just that we go through all the trouble to arrange the time to go down to the holodeck, to get the proper wardrobe, to get into character, and then boom, before we even get started you jump to the end. You see, I was looking forward to the mystery.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>DATA:  Then I should have extended the sequence of events.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Oh, I'm not getting through. The fun in the programme, Data, was in the attempt to solve a mystery.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>PULASKI:  You are wasting your breath, Lieutenant. Saying that to Data is asking a computer not to compute.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>PULASKI:  In medicine I'm often faced with puzzles that I do not know the answer to.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>PULASKI:  To feel the thrill of victory there has to be the possibility of failure. Where's the victory winning a battle you can't possibly lose?</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>PULASKI:  Yes. Yes, that's the great teacher. We humans learn more often from a failure or a mistake than we do from an easy success. But not you. You learn by rote. To you all is memorisation and recitation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  I don't know about that. Deductive reasoning is one of Data's strengths.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>PULASKI:  Yes, and Holmes too. But Holmes understood the human soul. The dark flecks that drive us, that turn the innocent into the evil. That understanding is beyond Data. It comes from life experience which he doesn't have combined with human intuition for which he cannot be programmed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>DATA:  This is no larger than the holodeck, of course, so the computer adjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeck walls</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  But with the image so perfect you'd have to touch the wall to know it was there. And the computer fools you in other ways. I say, Holmes, where shall we head? The theatre? Rule's? A concert perhaps?</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>DATA:  I saw the plaque 'The Home of the Red Headed League' and this rope dangling from the bell, which enabled me to deduce that Mister Jabez Wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise. From this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>PULASKI:  Variations on a theme. Now, now do you see my point? All that he knows is stored in his memory banks. Inspiration, original thought, all the true strength of Holmes is not possible for our friend. I'll give you credit for your vast knowledge, but your circuits would just short out if confronted by a truly original mystery. It's elementary, dear Data.</td></tr>
