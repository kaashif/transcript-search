     discharge in six seconds.

  WORF
     Firing, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A massive ray of energy goes out

  WORF
     The Borg ship is undamaged.

  SHELBY
     Impossible.

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Warp reactor core primary coolant
     failure.

  LAFORGE

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit.

  RIKER
     Cease fire.

  LAFORGE
     Shutting down warp engines.

  RIKER
     They couldn't have adapted that quickly.

  PICARD [on viewscreen]
     The knowledge and experience of the human Picard
     is part of us now. It has prepared us for all
     possible courses of action. Your resistance is
     hopeless, Number One.

  SOMEONE
     First Officer's log, stardate 44001.4. The Borg
     ship has resumed its course toward Earth. We are
     unable to pursue pending repairs to the
     Enterprise.


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  RIKER
     As we anticipated, the blast burned out our main
     navigational deflector. We also have damage to our
     shields and our reactor core.

  LAFORGE
     We should be back up in eight to twelve hours,
     Admiral.

  HANSON [on monitor]
     Well, we'll miss you at the party.

  RIKER
     The Enterprise'll be there, sir. Maybe a little
     late, but we'll be there, sir.

  HANSON [on monitor]
     Your engagements have given us valuable time.
     We've mobilised a fleet of forty starships at Wolf
     three five nine, and that's just for starters. The
     Klingons are sending warships. Hell, we've even
     thought about opening communications with the
     Romulans.

  SHELBY
     You realise, Admiral, that with the assistance of
     Captain Picard, the Borg will be prepared for your
     defences.

  HANSON [on monitor]
     Lieutenant a few years ago, I watched a freshman
     cadet pass four upper classman on the last hill of
     the forty kilometre run on Danula Two. The
     damndest thing I ever saw. The only freshman to
     ever win the Academy marathon. I made it my
     business to get to know that young fellow. I got
     to know him very, very well. And I'll tell you
     something. I never met anyone with more drive,
     determination or more courage than Jean-Luc
     Picard. There is no way in hell that he would
     assist the Borg. I want that clear.

  SHELBY
     Of course, Admiral.

  HANSON [on monitor]
     He is a casualty of war.

  CRUSHER
     Then we have abandoned all hope of recovering him.

  HANSON [on monitor]
     In less than twenty four hours, this armada's
     going to hit that Borg vessel with everything we
     can muster. Either they survive or we do. As for
     Picard. A great man has been lost. Your Captain.
     My friend. Commander Riker, I hereby promote you
     to the field commission of Captain. The Enterprise
     is your ship now. Congratulations. I wish the
     circumstances were different.

  RIKER
     Likewise. Good luck, Admiral.

  HANSON [on monitor]
     To us all.


LOCATION--Borg operating room

  ANNOTATION
     The entity originally Picard is being augmented.
     He gets a prosthetic forearm with attachments, and
     his skin turns white. A single tear rolls from his
     eye.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  RIKER
     Mister Crusher suggests we might design a chip
     that would automatically retune the phasers to a
     random setting after each discharge. Engineering.

  WORF
     That would be a great advantage.

  RIKER
     We should also see if there's some way that we can
     neutralise their forcefields. We've got to let
     them know that we can adapt too, Mister Worf.
     We're no longer just fighting the Borg, we're
     fighting the life experience they've stolen from
     Captain Picard. Now how the hell do we defeat an
     enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?

  WORF
     The Borg have neither honour nor courage. That is
     our greatest advantage.

  RIKER
     I hope it's enough.


LOCATION--Engineering

  SHELBY
     Accelerator coils are responding normally.

  LAFORGE
     Excellent. Forward shields at fifty eight percent.
     Aft shields sensors must be down

  SHELBY
     Checking. Sensors are fine. No. Aft shields have
     completely failed. Damn it. Auxiliary generators
     are out again.

  LAFORGE
     Just the man I need. We're having some problems
     with the aft shields. Generators going on and
     offline. I could really use your help, Worf

  RIKER
     How soon do we get underway, Geordi?

  LAFORGE
     Still a couple hours. Commander Shelby can fill
     you in.

  SHELBY
     The main navigational deflector is functional
     again. Sherbourne and Barclay are running through
     the final testing sequence now.

  RIKER
     The warp reactor core?

  SHELBY
     Reconstruction is proceeding normally. It's slow
     work. If we can nail down this shield generator
     problem, I agree with La Forge. We should be at
     operating capacity in two to three hours.

  RIKER
     Good.

  SHELBY
     Anything else, sir?

  RIKER
     Yes. You did a good job on the Borg ship.

  SHELBY
     I didn't get Picard.

  RIKER
     You stopped them. You gave us our shot.

  SHELBY
     Sir, I

  RIKER
     Commander, we don't have to like each other to
     work well together. As a fact of fact, I'd like
     you to continue to keep me on my toes.

  SHELBY
     Some might define that as the role of a first
     officer.

  RIKER
     Damn, you are ambitious, aren't you, Shelby.

  SHELBY
     Captain Riker, based on our past relationship,
     there's no reason for me to expect to become your
     first officer except you need me. I know how to
     get things done, and I have the expertise in the
     Borg.

  RIKER
     And you have a lot to learn, Commander.

  SHELBY
     Yes, sir.

  RIKER
     Almost as much as I had to learn when I came
     aboard as Captain Picard's first officer. A fact
     he reminded me of when I commented on what a pain
     in the neck you are.

  SHELBY
     Yes, sir.

  DATA [OC]
     Data to Riker. Message from Starfleet, Captain.

  RIKER
     Go ahead, Data.

  ANNOTATION
     transmission lost

  SOMEONE
     Captain's Log, stardate 44002.3. Repairs are
     complete, and the Enterprise is warping to
     rendezvous with Starfleet at Wolf three five nine.
     Communications from the site of battle have been
     cut off, possibly by Borg interference.


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  RIKER
     Lieutenant Worf, everyone in this room shares my
     respect for your service to this ship. But right
     now, I need your experience at tactical. Commander
     Data, I realise your very nature omits ambition.
     Nevertheless, I want you to know I seriously
     considered you first officer.

  DATA
     Thank you, sir.

  RIKER
     But this is not the time for change. I need you
     all where you are, where Captain Picard always
     relied on you. I have been, reluctantly, forced to
     conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert on the
     Borg, is an ideal choice at this time for first
     officer. Based on our latest communication, we can
     assume that the Borg survived the fleet's attack.
     Your thoughts on our next encounter?

  SHELBY
     What about the heavy graviton beam we were talking
     about?

  LAFORGE
     I've gone over it four times. The local field
     distortion just wouldn't be strong enough to
     incapacitate them.

  DATA
     Doctor Crusher and I have been working on an
     interesting premise.

  CRUSHER
     With our recent experience in nanotechnology, we
     might be able to introduce a destructive breed of
     nanites into the Borg.

  SHELBY
     Nanites?

  DATA
     Robots small enough to enter living cells.

  RIKER
     How long would it take to execute that?

  CRUSHER
     That's the problem. Two to three weeks.

  TROI
     In two or three weeks, nanites may be all that's
     left of the Federation.

  WORF
     We have the new phaser adapters.

  LAFORGE
     maybe in concert with photon torpedoes we can slow
     them down.

  RIKER
     I'm sure Captain Picard would have something
     meaningful and inspirational to say right now. To
     tell you the truth, I wish he were here, because
     I'd like to hear it too. I know how difficult this
     transition has been for all of you. I can take
     over for him, but I could never replace Captain
     Picard. Nor would I ever try. Whatever the
     outcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle
     will justify his faith in all of us. Dismissed.


LOCATION--Ready room

  RIKER
     (to the empty chair) What would you do?

  ANNOTATION
     doorbell

  RIKER
     Come.

  GUINAN
     May I speak to you, Captain?

  RIKER
     Actually, Guinan, I

  GUINAN
     You know, Picard and I used to talk every now and
     again, when one of us needed to. I guess I'm just
     used to having the Captain's ear.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits in Picard's chair

  RIKER
     What's on your mind?

  GUINAN
     I've heard a lot of people talking down in Ten
     Forward. They expect to be dead in the next day or
     so. They trust you. They like you. But they don't
     believe anyone can save them.

  RIKER
     I'm not sure anyone can.

  GUINAN
     When a man is convinced he's going to die
     tomorrow, he'll probably find a way to make it
     happen. The only one who can turn is around is
     you.

  RIKER
     I'll do the best I can.

  GUINAN
     You're going have to do something you don't want
     to do. You have to let go of Picard.

  RIKER
     Maybe you haven't heard. I tried to kill him
     yesterday.

  GUINAN
     You tried to kill whatever that is on the Borg
     ship. Not Picard. Picard is still here with us in
     this room. If he had died, it would be easier. But
     he didn't They took him from us a piece at a time.
     Did he ever tell you why we're so close?

  RIKER
     No.

  GUINAN
     Well, then let me just our relationship is beyond
     friendship, beyond family. And I will let him go.
     And you must do the same. There can only be one
     Captain.

  RIKER
     It's not that simple. This was his crew. He wrote
     the book on this ship.

  GUINAN
     And the Borg know everything he knows. It's time
     to throw that book away. You must let him go,
     Riker. It's the only way to beat him. The only way
     to save him. And that is now you chair. Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker sits

  WESLEY
     We're approaching the Wolf system, Captain.

  RIKER
     On my way.

     Sir, sensors are picking up unusually strong eddy
     currents, bearing two zero zero, mark two one one.

  RIKER
     Data, analysis?

  DATA
     It could indicate the course of the Borg ship,
     sir.

  RIKER
     Ensign Crusher, set in a course that follows those
     currents. Commander Shelby, prepare to initiate
     your plan to separate the saucer section when we
     find the Borg.

  SHELBY
     Sir. I must remind you that Captain Picard was
     briefed on that plan. The Borg will be prepared
     for it

  RIKER
     I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm
     counting on it.

  SHELBY
     Crusher, Cartaino, Gleason. Report to the Battle
     Bridge.

  RIKER
     Mister Data, Mister Worf? I have a special mission
     for you.


LOCATION--Borg ship

  ANNOTATION
     The Borg ship drops out of warp. A fully Borgified
     Picard looks at the Enterprise approaching

  RIKER [on viewscreen]
     Locutus of Borg, this is Captain William T. Riker
     of the USS Enterprise.

  PICARD
     You may speak.


LOCATION--Battle bridge

  RIKER
     We wish to end the hostilities.

  PICARD [on viewscreen]
     Then you must unconditionally surrender.

  RIKER
     We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms.

  PICARD [on viewscreen]
     It is unlikely you are prepared to discuss terms.
     It is more likely that this is an attempt at
     deception.

  RIKER
     Come now, Locutus. If Picard's knowledge and
     experience is part of you, then you know I've
     never lied to him. You should also implicitly
     trust me, is that not so?

  PICARD [on viewscreen]
     Picard implicitly trusted you.

  RIKER
     Then trust me now. Meet to discuss terms.

  PICARD [on viewscreen]
     Discussion is irrelevant. There are no terms. You
     will disarm all your weapons and escort us to
     Sector zero zero one where we will begin
     assimilating your culture and technology.

  RIKER
     Mister Gleason, can you pinpoint the source of the
     Borg transmission?

LOCATION--Battle bridge

  CREWMAN
     Channel open, sir.

  RIKER
     We would like time to prepare our people for
     assimilation.

  PICARD [on viewscreen]
     Preparation is irrelevant. Your people will be
     assimilated as easily as Picard has been. Your
     attempt at a delay will not be successful, Number
     One. We will proceed to Earth, and if you attempt
     to intervene, we will destroy you.

  RIKER
     Then take your best shot, Locutus, because we're
     about to intervene.

  RIKER
     Can you revive him?

  CRUSHER
     I'd like more time to study the structural changes
     in the motor pathways.

  RIKER
     We don't have more time, Doctor. Once he was wired
     into the Borg, they knew everything that he knew.
     I just hope it goes both ways. If we're lucky, he
     had access to everything we need to know about
     them, especially their vulnerabilities.

  CRUSHER
     Jean Luc? It's Beverly. can you hear me?

  PICARD
     Beverly. Crusher. Doctor.
