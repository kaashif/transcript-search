<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>PICARD:  You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historical parallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homes because of a political decision that has been taken by a distant government.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>NECHEYEV:  An Indian representative was included in the deliberations of the Federation Council. His objections were noted, discussed, but ultimately rejected. Captain, the Indians on Dorvan are a nomadic group that have settled there only twenty years ago, and at that time they were warned that the planet was hotly disputed by the Cardassians. The bottom line is they never should have gone there in the first place.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>NECHEYEV:  Then your orders will be to remove them by whatever means are necessary. I understand your moral objections, Captain. If you wish, I can find someone else to command the Enterprise for this mission.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ANTHWARA:  (a lovely mane of white hair) You do not understand, Captain. The choice of this world was not only because of environmental conditions. There were other more intangible concerns as well. When I came here twenty years ago, I was welcomed by the mountains, the rivers, the sky.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>WAKASA:  Anthwara, he's laughing at you. He thinks you're talking about old superstition and nonsense.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>ANTHWARA:  Then you can respect the fact that this planet holds a deep spiritual significance for us. It has taken us two centuries to find this place. We do not want to spend another two hundred years searching for what we already have.</td></tr>
