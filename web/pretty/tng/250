<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Apparently there was a massive energy surge in the distortion field around the planet just at the moment you tried to beam out. The Transporter Chief tried to compensate by initiating a second containment beam.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>DATA:  An interesting approach. He must have been planning to reintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Actually, it wasn't really necessary. Commander Riker's pattern maintained its integrity with just the one containment beam. He made it back to the ship just fine.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  That's the thing. Both. You were both materialised from a complete pattern.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>PICARD:  But of course, as you and Lieutenant Riker have lived very different lives for the past eight years, you are now very different people. I suppose it's a little like meeting someone's twin. But no matter how strange it may seem to us, we now have two Will Rikers on board. And as Lieutenant Riker will be with us for several days, I think we should do everything we can to make him comfortable and welcome.</td></tr>
