It is important that you be able to make the clay take the shape you want it to have, but you're not supposed to be concentrating on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on the feelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance, what do you think about when you see a bird?</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  In any case, it's definitely responsible for the system anomalies we've been experiencing. They're using our sensor beam as a carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and replicators.</td></tr>

Mister Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors. If the ship is in any danger, I want you to sever the connection immediately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>PICARD:  Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced technological society could have built that object out there. These artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think.</td></tr>
