  ANNOTATION
     Wesley is sitting next to Troi

  PICARD
     Riker says the planet's life forms are almost
     identical to us.

  TROI
     He's very enthusiastic.

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher enters

  CRUSHER
     Captain? Sorry, Troi.

  TROI
     The Doctor has something very important to tell
     you, Captain.

  PICARD
     You've been talking about it for days. Shore leave
     for the crew.

  CRUSHER
     Establishing that colony has been exhausting for
     the entire crew, Captain. We're not a supply
     vessel. Settling all those people has been a
     strain on everyone. I'm tired myself.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker, Data and Yar enter

  PICARD
     Is it as good as your report suggests, Number One?

  RIKER
     As per report, sir. Class M, Earth-like,
     beautiful. It will startle you.

  CRUSHER
     It sounds wonderful for the children. The
     holodecks are marvellous, of course, but there's
     nothing like open spaces and fresh air.

  TASHA
     I've listed my report on their customs and laws,
     sir. Fairly simple, common sense things.

  LAFORGE
     They're wild in some ways, actually puritanical in
     others. Neat as pins, ultra-lawful, and make love
     at the drop of a hat.

  TASHA
     Any hat.

  PICARD
     But the happiest report has its negatives. Let's
     start with them, Number One.

  RIKER
     There are none, sir. Not that any of us can find.

  DATA
     But there is a problem here, sir.

  WORF
     It's the faulty reading I reported, sir.

  DATA
     I'm reading something off the starboard bow, but
     there is nothing there.

  TASHA
     Sensor technicians are working on it, sir. They've
     identified it as a glitch in the system.

  PICARD
     I take it you find no glitch at all in this
     planet, however?

  RIKER
     No, sir.

  TASHA
     If you approve shore leave, sir, we could start
     with a small group.

  PICARD
     Of course. Wesley? If we go down, I'd like you to
     join the away team to evaluate this world as a
     place for young people to relax.

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir.

  PICARD
     If our scans and observations confirm the report,
     of course I'll approve it. Let's hope it is not
     too good to be true.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit of a
     planet designated Rubicun Three, the home of a
     life form who call themselves the Edo. Our away
     team, including Wesley Crusher, has beamed down to
     make arrangements concerning some well-deserved
     recreation.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     It's a lovingly tended garden extending in all
     directions. The people wear enough for modesty,
     run instead of walk, and are nauseatingly
     beautiful. When the team arrive two people run
     towards them

  WORF
     Careful, sir.

  RIKER
     No, it's all right, Lieutenant. Those are the Edo
     we met before. They certainly are fit.

  TROI
     They certainly are.

  RIVAN
     (a woman) Health and happiness.

  LIATOR
     (a man) A pleasant day to you.

  RIVAN
     You did return as promised.

  ANNOTATION
     She greets Riker with a slow, loving hug

  RIKER
     Rivan, Liator. Also from our vessel, Troi.

  LIATOR
     Slowly, slowly. I must also welcome this lovely
     one.

  ANNOTATION
     He nuzzles Troi's neck, she just pats his shoulder

  LIATOR
     Nice to see you again.

  TASHA
     My pleasure.

  RIKER
     Counsellor?

  TROI
     Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel mainly friendship,
     and (looking at Tasha) happiness.

  RIVAN
     And I welcome this huge one. Oh, yes.

  WORF
     (returning the hug) Nice planet.

  RIKER
     Yeah.

  RIVAN
     But you are a young one. I do not know your custom
     regarding love.

  WESLEY
     Er. I guess, whatever you usually do.

  ANNOTATION
     It's a very fleeting hug for the teenager

  RIKER
     There are others who would like to visit here, if
     you would give us a limit on the numbers.

  LIATOR
     Whatever pleases you. We can discuss it at the
     Council Chambers.

  RIVAN
     Shall we go there now or remain in play?

  RIKER
     Play?

  RIVAN
     At love. Unless you don't enjoy that. (to Worf)
     Perhaps you do?

  LIATOR
     And you? (Troi blushes) Yes, I can see that you
     do.

  WESLEY
     Maybe I should just go on ahead.

  RIVAN
     Oh, this is unfair to him. We'll go to the Council
     Chambers. You'll find young people your age there.

  WESLEY
     Well, I can't make any promises.

  LIATOR
     You don't have to. Our rules are simple. No one
     does anything uncomfortable to them.

  RIVAN
     Come! Our people will want to know you.

  LIATOR
     Rivan, perhaps they can't run.

  WESLEY
     Can't run? Sure we can run. Right, Commander?

  RIKER
     That's the custom here, running. Lead the way.

  ANNOTATION
     They all set off along a paved path

  RIKER
     When in Rome, eh?

  WORF
     When in where, sir?

  EDO
     Good health to you!

  TASHA
     Happiness to you! It's like an Eden here.


LOCATION--Outside the Council Chambers

  ANNOTATION
     A low rise building with formal fountains in front
     of it

  RIVAN
     Good health! I thought you might be out of breath.

  RIKER
     We may surprise you in a lot of ways.

  LIATOR
     Children, we've brought you a new friend!

  BOY
     Well, hello. Join us.

  GIRL
     Yes, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley runs off with the two boys and girl

  RIVAN
     And now it's time for you to meet some new
     friends.


LOCATION--Council Chambers

  ANNOTATION
     Musicians are playing gentle tunes, some couples
     are dancing, others strolling with glasses of
     drink. One man is getting a massage

  RIVAN
     Everyone! We've brought the visitors!

  LIATOR
     Please enjoy what we have!

  ANNOTATION
     And the team are lead away to - whatever


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     I've traced it through our sensor channel, sir It
     is not a glitch or any other form of error or
     malfunction.

  LAFORGE
     Confirmed by my readings, Captain. It's a shadow
     something.

  DATA
     Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our
     dimension.

  PICARD
     What is, Commander?

  DATA
     Whatever is sitting out there without triggering
     our alarm relays, sir.

  PICARD
     Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing,
     Commander.

  DATA
     Enterprise to object off our starboard bow.
     Request that you identify yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     And something appears

  LAFORGE
     Shields and deflectors up full, sir. Main phaser
     banks ready.

  PICARD
     Hailing frequencies. Any reply?

  DATA
     It was something unintelligible, Captain. Now
     running it through language and logic circuits.

  PICARD
     Geordi.

  LAFORGE
     Sir.

  PICARD
     Have a real look.

  LAFORGE
     Aye, sir.

  OFFICER
     (At Tasha's station) Sir, my sensors read it.
     Well, it's half there. It does look as if it were
     partly transparent.

  PICARD
     Data, what the hell is it?


LOCATION--Lounge

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi finds a window with a good view of the
     other thing

  LAFORGE
     Lieutenant La Forge to Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD
     Go ahead, LaForge. What can you make out?


LOCATION--Lounge

  LAFORGE
     This is something I've never seen before, sir.
     After complete spectral analysis, well it's as if
     it's not really there.


LOCATION--Bridge

  GEORDI [OC]
     I don't understand it.

  DATA
     I've got some information on its first
     transmission, sir. It translates as stand by.
