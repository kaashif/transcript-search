Angel One
TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     Ready to begin orbit of Angel One, Captain.

  PICARD
     Make it so, Mister La Forge. What kind of place is
     this, Data?

  DATA
     Angel One is a class M planet, sir, supporting
     carbon based flora and fauna, sparsely populated
     with intelligent life forms. It is similar in
     technological development to mid-twentieth century
     Earth.

  LAFORGE
     Kind of like being marooned at home.

  RIKER
     Assuming any of the survivors made it this far.
     Admittedly, it 'is the closest planet to the Odin,
     but to travel distance we did in two days at warp
     one would have taken the Odin escape pod five
     months.

  DATA
     Five months, fourteen days, eleven hours, two
     minutes

  RIKER
     Thank you, Data.

  DATA
     And fifty seven seconds.

  TASHA
     Captain, we're receiving an audio signal from
     Angel One.

  PICARD
     Starfleet are adamant that we maintain excellent
     diplomatic relations with this planet. Mister
     Data, is there any other pertinent information
     before we reply?

  DATA
     Angel One has evolved into a constitutional
     oligarchy. It is governed by a parliamentary body
     consisting of six elected Mistresses, and headed
     by a female they refer to as The Elected One.

  TROI
     It sounds like my own planet.

  WORF
     Klingons appreciate strong women.

  PICARD
     How current is this information, Mister Data?

  DATA
     A Federation vessel last visited this planet sixty
     two years ago, Captain.

  PICARD
     Counsellor, as this is a female dominated society,
     you might wish to make the initial contact.

  TROI
     Thank you, sir.

  PICARD
     Open hailing frequencies.

  TASHA
     Hailing frequencies open, sir.

  TROI
     This is Counsellor Deanna Troi from the USS
     Enterprise.

  BEATA
     [OC]: I am Beata, The Elected One. How may we
     assist you, Counsellor?

  TROI
     The Federation has neglected to visit to your
     planet for far too long. With your permission, we
     would like to correct that oversight.

  BEATA
     [OC]: We feel in no way neglected, Counsellor. A
     diplomatic courtesy call is neither expected nor
     required.

  TROI
     We also come in search of possible survivors from
     one of our freighters.

  BEATA
     [OC]: A brief visit will be tolerated.

  TASHA
     They've broken off transmission.

  LAFORGE
     Ever feel like you're not really wanted?


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     Where're you fellows off to?

  WESLEY
     Our ski instructor has us scheduled for the
     Denubian Alps, sir.

  RIKER
     Save us some deep powder.

  WESLEY
     No problem, sir. The holodecks have all you'll
     ever need.


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  ANNOTATION
     Riker, Troi, Tasha and Data get on the transporter
     pad

  RIKER
     The away team's ready, sir.

  PICARD
     Angel One's strategic importance in this quadrant
     may become vital. Starfleet's hope is that one day
     this world may become part of the Federation.

  RIKER
     We'll do our best to make a good impression, sir.

  PICARD
     Energise.

  SOMEONE
     Captain's log, supplemental. Our away team has
     beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society
     where the female is as aggressively dominant as
     the male gender was on Earth hundreds of years
     ago. Here, the female is the hunter, the soldier,
     larger and stronger than the male. An arrangement
     considered most sensible and natural.


LOCATION--Great Hall

  ANNOTATION
     There is a full gathering to greet the away team.
     People here kneel, not sit on chairs

  BEATA
     I am Beata, The Elected One of Angel One.
     Representatives of the Starfleet Enterprise, do
     you wish to petition?

  TROI
     We do. We have reason to hope that survivors from
     a damaged Federation freighter may be marooned on
     your planet. We are seeking to learn if this is
     so.

  BEATA
     Even a planet as remote as Angel One has heard of
     Starfleet. Searching the galaxy for survivors
     seems a petty task for one of their mighty
     vessels.

  RIKER
     We don't consider even one survivor petty.

  BEATA
     Is this man implying that we put a lesser value on
     life than you do?

  TROI
     Not at all. Our discovery of the freighter was
     unexpected. We have a duty to investigate.

  BEATA
     I see. And if you find any survivors, what then?

  TROI
     We will take them with us and see that they were
     reunited with their families.

  ARIEL
     Are we to take these strangers at their word?

  BEATA
     Good question.

  TASHA
     What reason could we possibly have to deceive you?

  BEATA
     Another good question.

  RIKER
     Are there survivors from the freighter Odin on
     your planet?

  BEATA
     I'm not prepared to answer, yet. See to their
     comforts.

  RIKER
     (to Troi) What's going on?


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TRENT
     You will remain here until summoned.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves as Tasha sweeps the room with her
     tricorder

  RIKER
     Is thus area secure? Can we talk?

  TASHA
     Yes. Tricorder doesn't show any listening devices
     or anything else of a threatening nature.

  RIKER
     Good. Troi?

  TROI
     There was much fear in that room.

  RIKER
     Paranoia, I'd say. But of what?

  TROI
     I cannot say. But their fear was not focused. I
     sensed that all were not concerned for the same
     reason. Undoubtedly there are survivors from the
     Odin on this planet.

  RIKER
     I agree. Otherwise, why would they be so
     circumspect?

  TASHA
     As Mistress Beata is so fond of saying, good
     question.

  DATA
     What do we do if they deny the existence of
     survivors?

  RIKER
     Let's not look for problems.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  PICARD
     I want all departments prepared for a warp six
     trip into the Neutral Zone as soon as the away
     team completes its mission.

  WORF
     Trouble, Captain?

  PICARD
     Insurance. Romulan battle cruisers have been
     detected near one of our border posts.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Picard steps out of the turbolift into a snowball

  PICARD
     They've requested assistance as soon as Argh!

  ANNOTATION
     The culprits leave the holodeck

  PICARD
     Report, Mister Crusher.

  WESLEY
     We finished our ski lesson, sir, and it kind of
     just happened.

  PICARD
     On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing just
     happens. What is that smell?

  WORF
     Hmm, yes. Slightly reminiscent of night blooming
     throgni, Captain. From home. Quite stimulating,
     wouldn't you say?

  PICARD
     No.

  WESLEY
     I don't smell anything. I'm a little congested.
     The snow.

  PICARD
     Don't let this just happen again, Mister Crusher.

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Data has found an atomiser, and gives himself a
     face-full

  DATA
     Interesting. An alcohol-based synthetic,
     artificially reproducing a floral scent.

  TROI
     It's called perfume, Data.

  DATA
     The purpose of which is?

  TASHA
     Certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac.

  DATA
     I am unfamiliar with that term.

  RIKER
     An aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or
     enhance sexual pleasure.

  DATA
     How does stimulation of the olfactory nerves
     affect the enjoyment of sex?

  ANNOTATION
     Trent enters

  TRENT
     The Elected One will see you now.

  ANNOTATION
     When the group have left, he sprays himself with
     the perfume


LOCATION--Great Hall

  BEATA
     You claim you intend to remove these survivors
     from our planet. Are you prepared to give us your
     solemn word on that?

  TROI
     We are.

  BEATA
     You should know that the vote was not unanimous.
     Some of those among us are suspicious. Yet the
     majority feel that we have no choice but to trust
     you.

  RIKER
     We don't understand the source of your misgivings,
     Mistress, but we appreciate your faith in us.

  BEATA
     Make certain that faith is not misplaced. There
     are four survivors from the ship you call Odin.
     All male. Their leader is a man who calls himself
     Ramsey.

  TROI
     If you'll deliver these men to us, we'll have them
     off your planet immediately.

  BEATA
     If they were mine to deliver, I would do it
     without hesitation. Unfortunately, their hiding
     place has long eluded us.

  TASHA
     Hiding place? Why are they in hiding?

  BEATA
     Because they are fugitives on Angel One, and the
     quicker we get rid of them, the better. When these
     men came to us seven years ago, they accepted our
     hospitality quickly enough. But they gradually
     became restive, started making unreasonable
     demands, went against the natural order.

  TROI
     Using the technology of the Enterprise, we might
     be able to find these men.

  BEATA
     I assumed as much. But be warned, Counsellor,
     these men are dangerous.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley and his ski-ing companion are in beds,
     coughing

  CRUSHER
     Sickbay to Captain Picard.

  PICARD [OC]
     Picard here.

  CRUSHER
     Wesley and one of his friends have contracted some
     form of respiratory ailment.

  PICARD [OC]
     A respiratory aliment? Is it contained?

  CRUSHER
     I hope so. I've isolated the twelve students who
     were on the Quazulu Eight field trip.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD
     How contagious is it?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     Still running tests. The key is to figure out how
     the virus is transmitted. So far I've been able to
     rule out


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Person to person contact.

  PICARD
     Well, keep with it, Doctor. Starfleet has very
     important business for us as soon as the away team
     returns. I don't fancy the idea of my crew being
     infected.


LOCATION--Great Hall

  RIKER
     Data, what's the best way to go about finding
     Ramsey and the other survivors?

  DATA
     If we can isolate something unique to the Odin
     survivors, perhaps an element not otherwise found
     on Angel One, we can utilise the Enterprise
     scanners.

  RIKER
     Mister Data will need access to your library.

  BEATA
     Our library is far too sophisticated for a man to
     comprehend.

  DATA
     I am an android, Mistress, although anatomically I
     am a male.

  BEATA
     An amusing notion. Maybe you could teach our males
     a thing or two. Trent, see to the android's needs.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Bridge to Captain Picard.

  PICARD
     [OC]: Go ahead, Lieutenant.

  WORF
     The away team requests that we scan the planet
     surface for traces of platinum.

  PICARD
     [OC]: Have Mister La Forge break fixed orbit and
     initiate a search pattern.

  WORF
     Aye, Captain. Geordi.

  LAFORGE
     Search pattern initiated now.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Riker enters, and Troi hands him a local male
     outfit on a hangar

  TROI
     This was delivered for you.

  RIKER
     Good. It's for my meeting with Beata.

  TROI
     You're not going to wear that.

  RIKER
     Of course. Part of this mission is diplomatic. I
     have requested an audience with a head of state,
     and I will honour her by wearing indigenous
     apparel.

  TASHA
     I don't believe this. You're going to put that
     thing on and parade around like one of them?

  RIKER
     Why, what is this attitude? On Kabatris I had to
     wear furs to meet the leadership council. And on
     Armus Nine I wore feathers. This objection doesn't
     have anything to do with the fact that Beata is a
     woman, and an attractive one, does it?


LOCATION--Ready Room

  ANNOTATION
     The Captain is obviously ill

  PICARD
     This is quite unnecessary, Doctor. I'm fine.

  CRUSHER
     You're infected with the virus. Captain. In my
     opinion, you are no longer physically able to
     effectively command this vessel.

  PICARD
     That is ridiculous, Doctor. I have an away team
     down there, in less than friendly territory, and
     in addition I have an appointment with several
     Romulan battlecruisers.

  CRUSHER
     You have an appointment in your cabin, Captain.
     With your bed.

  PICARD
     Is that an order, Doctor?

  CRUSHER
     Yes.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     I think I may sneeze.

  LAFORGE
     A Klingon sneeze?

  WORF
     Only kind I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard and Crusher enter

  PICARD
     Lieutenant La Forge, you have command until
     further notice. Please, make the proper ship's log
     entries.

  LAFORGE
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi goes and sits in the Captain's chair

  WORF
     Scanners indicate a platinum trace. Should I
     notify the away team?

  LAFORGE
     Make it so.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TROI
     Tasha.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker emerges in full local costume, left breast
     and chest hair to the waist fully on show. The
     women find it highly amusing

  RIKER
     What do you think?

  TASHA
     Well, I got to say, it's kind of sexy.

  RIKER
     Thank you, Lieutenant. Actually it feels quite
     comfortable.


LOCATION--Beata's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     They also double as her private office

  BEATA
     How handsome you look.

  RIKER
     Thank you, The Enterprise reports a possible
     location for Mister Ramsey and the other
     survivors.

  BEATA
     So soon? I'm impressed.

  ARIEL
     I suspicious.

  RIKER
     You don't believe me?

  ARIEL
     Not yet. I hear the words, but not the sincerity.

  BEATA
     You had your opportunity to object, Ariel. You
     were in the minority.

  ARIEL
     After seven years, the great ship Enterprise come
     to repatriate a small group of insignificant
     people.

  RIKER
     Mistress Ariel, I hear the words but not the
     sincerity.

  ARIEL
     You should listen more carefully. Excuse me,
     Mistress. I have matters to attend to elsewhere.

  ANNOTATION
     Ariel leaves, and Trent follows

  RIKER
     With your permission, we'd like to begin our
     search immediately.

  BEATA
     By all means. But I'm sure that Counsellor Troi
     and the others can do that without you. If I
     recall, you had a gesture of goodwill you wished
     to give to me?

  RIKER
     Certainly that can wait until we've recovered the
     survivors.

  BEATA
     Are you suggesting that the women in your party
     are incapable of accomplishing their task without
     the help of a man?

  RIKER
     Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and Counsellor Troi are
     completely qualified.

  BEATA
     You're very generous with your praise. Inform them
     you will remain here with me.

  RIKER
     Riker to Lieutenant Yar.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TASHA
     This is Yar.

  RIKER
     In the interests of diplomatic relations, I'll
     remain here with Mistress Beata while you conduct
     our search.

  TASHA
     Commander?

  RIKER [OC]
     You have your instructions.

  BEATA
     Relax. We have much to discuss.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes through gauze curtains into another room


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TASHA
     Set phasers to stun.

  TROI
     I wish they weren't necessary.

  DATA
     A justified precaution, Counsellor. Mistress Beata
     observed that Mister Ramsey and his men are
     dangerous.

  TASHA
     Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     Go ahead, Tasha.

  TASHA

     Status report.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     Eighty-two more reported cases of the virus, sir.
     Doctor Crusher's converted the holodeck into an
     isolation ward.

  PICARD
     And the away team?


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     Well, no recent contact, sir, but I have informed
     them of the medical situation up here and the
     growing Romulan threat to our Neutral Zone
     outpost.

  PICARD
     Keep me advised. You have the Bridge until

  WORF
     Engineering reports a computer malf (sneeze) I'm
     sorry, I'm getting sick.

  LAFORGE
     I'm sure half the ship knows that by now. Report
     to Sickbay, Lieutenant.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Engineering to bridge.

  LAFORGE

  LAFORGE
     On my way.

  WORF
     With all respect, Lieutenant, there are people to
     do that job now.

  LAFORGE
     La Forge to Engineering. Lieutenant Wong knows the
     system. I'm sure she'll be able to resolve all
     problems. Worf, thanks for the advice.


LOCATION--Hideout

  RAMSEY
     How did you find me?

  DATA
     Actually, it was quite simple. Angel One has no
     platinum. Enterprise scanners did the rest.

  RAMSEY
     Platinum, was it? My wings. I kept them for their
     sentimental value.

  TASHA
     Where are the other survivors, Mister Ramsey?

  RAMSEY
     Oh, they're nearby. They're packing, as a matter
     of fact, since we can no longer remain here.

  TROI
     Seven years on an alien planet, and I sense no
     anticipation, no excitement at being rescued.

  RAMSEY
     What is it that you think you're rescuing me from?
     My shipmates and I have all taken wives. A few
     even have children. You can't rescue a man from a
     place that he calls his home.


LOCATION--Beata's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Beata has slipped into something more comfortable

  RIKER
     Why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about
     the Odin survivors?

  BEATA
     Simply because Ramsey and his men are anarchists.
     I had to make sure you weren't here to fuel their
     struggle. I like the way your eyes pick up the
     colour of your tunic.

  RIKER
     It's not our position to interfere in the domestic
     affairs of other societies.

  BEATA
     But you can interact.

  RIKER
     Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn?

  BEATA
     Is that why you're here with me tonight? To learn?

  RIKER
     Yes.

  BEATA
     About our society.

  RIKER
     Yes.

  BEATA
     Well, in our society, it is the men who are the
     fortunate ones, enjoying all life has to offer
     while we women devote ourselves to the obligation
     of making life work.

  RIKER
     In our society, we share the responsibilities and
     the pleasures equally. Which is why I am able to
     be here with you while the women of the away team
     go to find Ramsey.

  BEATA
     You'll have to remind me to thank them when they
     come back for giving us this time.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him

  BEATA
     You resist. Don't you find me attractive?

  RIKER
     Yes, I find you very attractive.

  BEATA
     You attract me like no man ever has.

  RIKER
     It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by
     the leader of another world.

  BEATA
     It's not the reason.

  RIKER
     No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the
     morning?

  BEATA
     I hope so.

  ANNOTATION
     They get into a clinch just as Trent enters and
     hands a gift to Riker

  RIKER
     Thank you, Trent.

  BEATA
     You may go.

  ANNOTATION
     Trent leaves reluctantly. Riker opens the gift for
     Beata

  RIKER
     Compliments of the USS Enterprise. It's called an
     Albeni meditation crystal.

  ANNOTATION
     He touches it with a rod, and it pulses with a
     yellow glow

  BEATA
     Very impressive. And now I must repay you in kind.


LOCATION--Hideout

  RAMSEY
     Five months in a rescue pod no bigger than this
     room is an eternity I hope none of you will ever
     have to face. When we finally made it here, we
     thought we'd died and gone to heaven. You've seen
     the women of the planet. They're tall and strong
     and lovely. But after the newness wore off, we
     started to see how the men were treated. There's
     no votes. There's no opinions. There's no respect.

  TASHA
     None of which is your concern any longer, Mister
     Ramsey. Call the others in, please. It's time to
     leave.

  RAMSEY
     Despite their problems, Lieutenant, we happen to
     like it here on Angel One. We're not going
     anywhere.

  TROI
     But Mistress Beata

  RAMSEY
     Mistress Beata be damned! Her wish is not my
     command, and neither is yours. You can't force us
     to go.

  DATA
     Mister Ramsey is correct, Counsellor. The Odin was
     not a starship, which means her crew is not bound
     by the Prime Directive. If he and the others wish
     to stay here, there is absolutely nothing we can
     do about it.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  LAFORGE
     [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay how are you Doing, Doctor?

     we'll return to the ship.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     I suggest you make that on the double, Tasha. We
     have a real medical emergency brewing up here.


LOCATION--Hideout

  LAFORGE [OC]
     One third of the crew is down, and the latest
     information from the Neutral Zone outpost is that
     more Romulan vessels are converging on that area.

  TASHA
     I'll inform the Commander. Yar out. One thing
     before we go. You said you were expecting us. Why?

  RAMSEY
     I can't answer that.

  TROI
     We wish you well, Mister Ramsey.

  TASHA
     Energise.

  ANNOTATION
     The three beam away

  RAMSEY
     They're gone.

  ANNOTATION
     Ariel comes out and embraces him


LOCATION--Beata's quarters

  BEATA
     What a refreshing change to be with a man who
     knows what he wants.

  RIKER
     And doesn't have to be told by a woman?

  BEATA
     Exactly. I knew you were bright enough to
     understand. You see, women, by our very nature,
     want only what is best for their men.

  RIKER
     Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress
     Beata.

  BEATA
     Of course they're not. It was merely a figure of
     speech.

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell. She rolls over and turns off the
     meditation crystal and gets up.

  BEATA
     Enter.

  ANNOTATION
     Trent comes in

  BEATA
     What is so important you find it necessary to
     intrude upon my privacy?

  TRENT
     They have returned, Mistress, but without Ramsey
     or the others.

  ANNOTATION
     Tasha, Troi and Data enter

  BEATA
     Your advanced technology has proven inadequate?

  RIKER
     What happened, Tasha?

  TROI
     Mister Ramsey and the other survivors refuse to
     leave.

  BEATA
     You gave me your solemn word.

  RIKER
     I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do.

  BEATA
     I'm sorry as well. Since you refuse to take them
     with you, I am left with no choice but to sentence
     them all to death.


LOCATION--Picard's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher enters bearing a flask. Picard is in bed,
     bare-chested

  PICARD
     Come.

  CRUSHER
     It looks horrible, tastes worse, and it's
     absolutely guaranteed to make you feel better.

  ANNOTATION
     He drinks

  CRUSHER
     I knew you'd like it. Are you wearing cologne?
     Like something I smelled earlier. Something
     Klingon.

  PICARD
     Lieutenant Worf and I detected the same scent when
     we bumped into your son at the Holodeck.

  CRUSHER
     It's that smell. That's how the virus travels. An
     airborne particle whose sweet scent inspires deep
     inhalation. And once inside the body, it becomes
     that damned virus. I have work to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher leaves

  PICARD
     You are excused, Doctor.


LOCATION--Great hall

  RIKER
     What's the latest on the Enterprise's medical
     situation?

  DATA
     Doctor Crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly
     run unchecked through the entire ship. Attempts to
     develop an inoculants have so far ended in
     failure. Lieutenant La Forge still has Bridge
     command pending your return, sir.

  RIKER
     And what about the Romulans entering the Neutral
     Zone?

  DATA
     The border outpost reports a contingent of seven
     Romulan battlecruisers within sensor range. The
     USS Berlin has answered the distress call.
     However, should hostilities erupt, both the
     outpost and the starship will be out-gunned. It is
     felt that the Enterprise's presence in the area
     will be a vital show of force.

  TASHA
     Some show of force. The Enterprise could fly on
     autopilot, but with that virus knocking down our
     crew, we're going to be in sorry shape if things
     turn ugly.

  RIKER
     I think it's time we to leave this place.

  TROI
     It doesn't feel right to leave while Beata is
     determined to execute those people.

  RIKER
     She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch
     have been fugitives for years. I suspect he's
     pretty good at evading capture.

  TROI
     Something's wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     Beata enters, with Trent

  BEATA
     Before you go back to your ship, there's something
     I want you to see.

  ANNOTATION
     Ramsey and his group are brought in

  RAMSEY
     We were no harm to anyone. Why did you tell them
     where to find us?

  BEATA
     You brought this upon yourself. You and the
     traitor. One does not need the technology of the
     Enterprise to follow Mistress Ariel sneaking out
     to warn her husband. Let her stand with him now.
     For tomorrow they will die together.


LOCATION--Beata's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Beata is doing paperwork

  RIKER
     You claim to be an advanced society, and yet you
     resort to executions in order to suppress those
     who don't share your views.

  BEATA
     I don't expect you to understand.

  RIKER
     Why? Because I'm only a man?

  BEATA
     You'll accomplish nothing with that attitude.

  RIKER
     Mistress Beata, if you had an alternative to the
     execution of Ramsey and his followers, would you
     take it?

  BEATA
     Is that not the way of an advanced society?

  RIKER
     Then let us meet with the men from Odin one last
     time. Let me try to convince them to leave with
     us.

  BEATA
     Will you also include those from this world who
     unwisely choose to follow Ramsey and his group?

  RIKER
     Yes. All of them.


LOCATION--Holding area

  TROI
     Mistress Beata is willing to give you a second
     chance. We're prepared to take your entire group
     with us.

  RAMSEY
     That's very kind of you, but we're not going.

  TASHA
     Haven't you been paying attention, Ramsey? You're
     scheduled to be executed tomorrow.

  RAMSEY
     We don't want to die. We don't want to leave,
     either.

  RIKER
     There's no time to debate the issues. You're going
     with us whether you choose to go or not.

  DATA
     Excuse me, Commander, but removing any of these
     people against their will would be a violation of
     several Starfleet regulations, not the least of
     which would be the Prime Directive.

  RIKER
     I realise that, Mister Data. I'd rather face a
     court martial than live with the guilt of leaving
     these people to their deaths. Commander Riker to
     Enterprise.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     This is the Enterprise. Crusher here.

  TASHA
     It must be worse up there than we thought.

  RIKER
     Doctor, where is Lieutenant La Forge?


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     He's right here, but he's in bad shape.

  RIKER [OC]
     Notify the transporter room I have fourteen to
     beam up.

  CRUSHER
     I can't allow it.


LOCATION--Holding area

  CRUSHER [OC]
     This virus is totally out of control here. Until I
     know exactly what I'm dealing with, I can't let
     anyone new be exposed.

  RIKER
     Doctor, these people are facing their deaths down
     here.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     They might be facing the same thing up here. Until
     I have a better idea of what I'm dealing with, no
     one can beam up. I'm sorry, Will, but you must
     wait.


LOCATION--Holding area

  RIKER
     Understood. Doctor, would this virus have any
     effect on Mister Data?

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Not likely.

  RIKER
     You're going back there alone. I want you to get
     the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone before it's
     too late.

  DATA
     This is Data, standing by to beam up.

  ANNOTATION
     He beams away

  TROI
     What of them?

  RIKER
     I don't know, Deanna.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TRENT
     Mistress Beata invites you to witness this
     morning's reaffirmation of Angel One's moral
     imperative.

  TASHA
     Is that the civilised word for murder on this
     world?

  RIKER
     You send Mistress Beata our regrets.

  TRENT
     The Elected One will not look fondly upon

  DATA
     [OC]: Enterprise to Commander Riker.

  TROI
     They're still here!

  RIKER
     Riker here. Data, I gave you direct orders to get
     to Neutral Zone immediately. Explain the delay.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     To be precise, Commander, you ordered me to reach
     the Neutral Zone before it is too late.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  DATA
     After relieving Lieutenant La Forge, I computed
     the length of time the border outpost


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     And the USS Berlin can safely withstand a Romulan
     attack, and deducted our time to destination at
     maximum warp speed. That leaves Doctor Crusher
     forty eight minutes to develop an inoculants to
     the virus.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TASHA
     Which means there's still time for us to do
     something.

  RIKER
     Forty-eight minutes.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Forty seven, sir.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  RIKER
     Perhaps, Data, perhaps. Thank you


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER [OC]
     For following my orders so precisely, Data.


LOCATION--Guest Quarters

  RIKER
     On second thought, Trent, we would be honoured to
     witness your moral imperative in action.


LOCATION--Great Hall

  BEATA
     (upset) We have determined that the heretical
     teachings of Ramsey and his followers are
     inconsistent with harmonious life on Angel One.
     Our patient efforts to silence revolutionary
     voices have failed. Therefore we are left with
     none but the most final alternative.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a large jar between two devices. Trent
     puts his hands on a glass globe, it glows purple,
     the devices light up and disintegrate the jar

  BEATA
     As you can see, we are not without compassion.
     Your deaths will be swift and painless.

  RIKER
     Mistress Beata, before we see living examples of
     your compassion, may I speak?

  BEATA
     Is this a plea for leniency?

  RIKER
     Nothing of the sort. As the governing body of
     Angel One, you're entitled to execute your laws or
     your citizens as you see fit.

  BEATA
     Make your point, so we can proceed with this
     unpleasant business.

  RIKER
     When you spoke of the prisoners, you used the term
     revolutionary. Indeed, death has been known to
     stop revolutions. But I suspect it's not a
     revolution that Angel One is hoping to stop. It's
     evolution. Mister Ramsey and the Odin survivors
     did not initiate the waves of dissent that are
     rippling through your planet. Their presence here
     merely reinforced the change in attitudes between
     men and women that was already well under way.
     They became symbols around whom others who shared
     their views could gather. You may eliminate the
     symbols, but that does not mean death to the
     issues which those symbols represent. No power in
     the universe can hope to stop the force of
     evolution. Be warned. The execution of Mister
     Ramsey and his followers may elevate them to the
     status of martyrs. Martyrs cannot be silenced.

  ANNOTATION
     Ramsey is taken to the place of execution. Trent
     starts to lower his hand

  ARIEL
     Beata!

  BEATA
     Stop. We will adjourn to consider your words.

  ANNOTATION
     The council leaves

  RAMSEY
     Thank you.

  RIKER
     I don't know if it was enough.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     [OC]: Sickbay to Bridge.

  DATA
     Go ahead, Doctor.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Bingo, Data.

  DATA
     Bingo? I fail to see the relevance, Doctor. Is
     that not a reference to an ancient Earth game?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     It's also a reference to success, Data. I've got
     the inoculants.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Excellent, Doctor. We still have seventeen minutes
     left. I will inform the away team immediately.
     Enterprise to Riker.


LOCATION--Great hall

  DATA [OC]
     We are ready to have you beamed up, Commander.

  RIKER
     Data, Ramsey and the prisoners are with us in the
     Great Hall. I want you to lock the transporter.
     Prepare to evacuate the entire group.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER [OC]
     But for now, stand by.

  DATA
     Understood, Commander.


LOCATION--Great hall

  ANNOTATION
     Beata and the council enter

  BEATA
     After careful consideration, this legislature has
     voted to stay the execution of the prisoners.
     Their children will be returned to them
     immediately. Do not rejoice prematurely. Ramsey
     and his followers are to be exiled to a distant
     and unpopulated region. Life will be difficult
     there with little time for revolutionary or
     evolutionary upheaval. As some have observed, we
     may be able to stop evolution, but perhaps we can
     reduce it to a slow crawl. For a man, you can be
     very clever, Commander Riker.

  RIKER
     Riker to Enterprise. Belay my previous order,
     Mister Data. There will now be only three to beam
     up. Energise.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Beverly greet the arrivals with an injection

  CRUSHER
     Welcome home.

  TROI
     It's good to be back.

  RIKER
     Are they recovering?

  CRUSHER
     Slowly, but yes.

  RIKER
     And the Captain?

  PICARD
     (hoarse) The Captain is fine, thank you. Mister
     Data has been briefing me on the away team's
     comportment, Number One.

  TROI
     We improvised, sir.

  PICARD
     I look forward to your reports.

  RIKER
     Don't we have a call to pay on the Romulans,
     Captain?

  PICARD
     Indeed we do. Mister Data, set course for the
     Neutral Zone. Warp six. DATA: Co-ordinates set.
     Warp six on your mark, sir.

  PICARD
     (inaudible) Engage.

  DATA
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Picard glares at Riker

  RIKER
     Engage.
