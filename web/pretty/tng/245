<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>NELLA:  Earl Grey? No wonder you can't sleep. Computer, bring replicators back online and give me a cup of Daren herbal tea blend number three, hot. You shouldn't be drinking a stimulant at this time of night. I think you'll like this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>PICARD:  It's an herbal tea blend. I, er, found it in the replicator files. Have you met any of the new crewmembers who came aboard at Starbase two eighteen?</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>PICARD:  It's really quite intriguing. The whole thing is made possible by a complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion. But that's only the foundation. The modeling itself is done by gravimetric wave input.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  I see.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>PICARD:  Well, I know this is all pretty dry stuff. Stellar cartography isn't everybody's cup of tea.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>PICARD:  No, no, no, I'm just an amateur. But your choice in that arpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one would expect.</td></tr>
