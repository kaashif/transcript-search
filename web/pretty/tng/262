<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>JULIANA:  Captain, our situation has worsened since my husband and I first contacted you. The molten core of our planet is not just cooling, it's begun to solidify.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>PRAN:  Our gravitational field has been affected. Seismic activity has increased by a factor of three.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>JULIANA:  If the cooling continues at this rate Atrea will become uninhabitable in thirteen months.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  We could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric fissures and relieving some of the tectonic stress, but that would just be a temporary fix.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>DATA:  The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  These pockets in the magma layer, how close are they to the molten region of the core?</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>JULIANA:  A few kilometres, why?</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Data, do you think that's close enough for ferro-plasmic infusion?</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>DATA:  The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill down through the planet's surface into the pockets, where we would set up a series of plasma infusion units.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  We'll trigger the units by firing modulated energy bursts down through the shafts.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>JULIANA:  I see. Injecting sufficient plasma directly into the core should trigger a chain reaction, and that will reliquify the magma.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>DATA:  It should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety three percent of normal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>PRAN:  If it works, the core would remain molten for centuries.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>PICARD:  If you give your permission, we could begin immediately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>PRAN:  Very well. But before we proceed, I'd like to update our geological surveys.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Fine. I'd be very happy to help you with that, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>DATA:  Doctor, I have no memory of you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>JULIANA:  Oh, there's a reason for that. We wiped your processors after we finished refining your programming. Why don't you tell me what you do remember, and then I'll fill in the gaps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>DATA:  My memory record begins when I was activated by the Starfleet officers on the Omicron Theta outpost.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>JULIANA:  After the attack of the Crystalline Entity.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>DATA:  Yes. All of the inhabitants of the colony were killed. However, I discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their journals and logs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>JULIANA:  We hoped their experiences would be useful. After your childhood, we figured you could use all the help you could get.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>DATA:  My childhood?</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>JULIANA:  That's what I called it. You were like a baby, at first. A hundred kilogram baby, but still. You had trouble learning your motor skills, learning how to process sensory information. And of course Noonian was never satisfied. He kept tinkering, trying to make you as human as possible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>DATA:  So you wiped my memory processors after this childhood.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>JULIANA:  Then we deactivated you and programmed you with the colonists' logs. We had planned to reactivate you, but we never got the chance. That's when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We had to leave quickly. We wanted to take you with us, but there was only room for two in the escape pod.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>DATA:  Doctor, I have scanned the journals of the colonists. There is only one Juliana mentioned in them. Her last name was O'Donnell.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>JULIANA:  That's me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>DATA:  But there was no mention that my father was married to you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>JULIANA:  Because of my mother. She thought that Noonian was an eccentric scientist who was too old for me. We decided to marry secretly to give her a chance to get used to our being together. We slipped away to Mavala Four and got married there. A Klingon and a Corvallan trader were our witnesses. It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd hoped for. Somehow Noonian had a way of making even the oddest things seem romantic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>DATA:  My father did have an unusual way of looking at things.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>JULIANA:  How would you know that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>DATA:  I encountered him once in the Terlina system.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>JULIANA:  That's where we went to after we left the outpost. I had no idea that you'd even met him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>DATA:  It was shortly before his death.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>JULIANA:  He's dead?</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>DATA:  Yes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>JULIANA:  I had no idea it would hit me this hard. We didn't exactly part on the best of terms.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>DATA:  What do you mean?</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>JULIANA:  I realised he loved his work as much as he loved me. Maybe more. There we were, stuck on this planet in the middle of the jungle with no one else to talk to. No life. It just wasn't enough. That's why I left. That was all a very, very long time ago. The important thing is that we're here now together. And I do want to get to know you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>DATA:  This has been an interesting encounter, and an altogether unexpected one. I would like to corroborate your story before we proceed further. Excuse me, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>DATA:  I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply attempting to verify her assertions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Well, what have you turned up so far?</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>DATA:  The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm whether Doctor Soong was married there. Apparently many of the documents were lost when the government was overthrown.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  What's that you're looking at?</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>DATA:  I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavala during the period in question. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonian. They were both passengers on a transport which travelled from Omicron Theta to Mavala and returned four days later.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  That sure fits with her story.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>DATA:  Still, the fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they were married there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  You know, Data, it almost seems to me like you're trying to prove that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling the truth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>DATA:  Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with the fact that my father never mentioned her to me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Well, she did leave him. Maybe she broke his heart. Maybe he just didn't want to talk about her. Let me ask you this. Doctor Soong created an emotion chip. Didn't Lore tell you that chip also contained memories, memories Soong wanted you to have?</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>DATA:  Yes. It is possible that those are memories of my childhood. And of Mrs Soong.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  When you think about it, why would she want to lie? Why would anybody want to pretend to be your mother?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>DATA:  I can think of no motive for such a pretense.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  And I can understand that this might all be a little disconcerting for you, Data. It came out of the blue, and it doesn't fit into your logical processors.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>DATA:  That is true.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  But that's life, Data. Part of being human is learning how to deal with the unexpected. To risk new experiences even when they don't fit into your preconceptions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>DATA:  I admit I am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of a past about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curious to learn more about it.</td></tr>

Some of the colonists objected to having an anatomically correct android running around without any clothes on. We asked you to dress, but you didn't feel it was necessary because you didn't suffer from the elements. We actually had to write a modesty sub-routine to get you to keep your clothes on.</td></tr>
