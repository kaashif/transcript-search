<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>PICARD:  This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message to Lutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you have visited our vessel, you most certainly know the power of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion, Counsellor. Will they injure Lieutenant Yar?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>TROI:  I believe not, sir. They seem mainly curious. In the case of Lutan, however, I did feel other needs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  And we can't. The sample works fine when used as an injection, but it becomes unstable when we try to replicate it. You must get the vaccine from the planet, Captain. As much as you can. Immediately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L114"><td><a href="#L114">114</a></td><td>DATA:  It is a highly structured society in which people live by strict codes of honour.

<tr id="L118"><td><a href="#L118">118</a></td><td>DATA:  Yes, sir. Counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemy with a stick in battle, or taking something from him and escaping. It was considered extremely heroic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L119"><td><a href="#L119">119</a></td><td>RIKER:  And under these circumstances Lutan considers himself heroic, risking literally everything in the face of our superior power.</td></tr>

<tr id="L120"><td><a href="#L120">120</a></td><td>TROI:  And it fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has an abnormally high need for achievement. Self image to him is a function of what he thinks he's achieved. Those who set their standards too high can kill to meet them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L139"><td><a href="#L139">139</a></td><td>RIKER:  And I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar, and devious. Counsellor Troi has admitted she believes he's capable of killing. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger, sir.</td></tr>
