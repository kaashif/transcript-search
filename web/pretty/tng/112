<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>KARNAS [on viewscreen]:  I am Karnas, governor of Mordan Four. A dissident group of terrorists have taken Federation Ambassador Hawkins and his staff hostage. They will not discuss terms with me. This is a crisis I cannot resolve. The terrorists are demanding a Federation negotiator. I feel there is only one negotiator with the skills to resolve the situation. The lives of the hostages will depend on Starfleet delivering this man to Mordan. Commander Mark Jameson. Admiral Jameson. The terrorists have given you six Earth days to bring him here, or the hostages will die.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>PICARD:  Starfleet cannot understand how or why this situation has developed. Mordan Four has finally gained peace after decades of civil war</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>JAMESON [on viewscreen]:  Forty years of civil war, Captain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>PICARD:  Yes, sir. Karnas was largely responsible for the planet's unification and peace. Why should he now be unable to deal with this rebellious faction?</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>JAMESON [on viewscreen]:  Forty-five years ago I negotiated a hostage situation on Mordan, Captain. Karnas was a young man then, but so was I. He seems to feel that I can handle the situation again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>PICARD:  I'm detailed to take you to Mordan Four as soon as you can be ready, Admiral.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>JAMESON:  My wife and I will beam aboard at fifteen hundred hours, Captain. Acknowledge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>PICARD:  Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>TROI:  Nearly fifteen hundred now, sir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>JAMESON:  My wife, Anne. Captain, there are certain details of this mission that you should understand before we begin.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>PICARD:  Yes, sir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>JAMESON:  I am not simply an advisor. On any assignment I accompany, Starfleet has designated me Senior Mission Officer. I control the away team and all its actions. Is that understood? Of course, Captain, you command the ship, but the mission is mine. I trust you are in complete agreement.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>PICARD:  Yes, sir. Of course.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>KARNAS [on viewscreen]:  Is Admiral Jameson on board?</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>PICARD:  He's here, beside my First Officer. Do you wish to speak to him now?</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>KARNAS [on viewscreen]:  So, Jameson. I see time has not been kind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>JAMESON:  It seldom is, Karnas. However, we could save a good deal of it now if you'll outline the terrorists' demands.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>KARNAS [on viewscreen]:  They insist all discussions will take place here on Mordan. They refuse to speak to me, only to a Federation mediator. They say they will brook no excuses. If there are any offered, your ambassador and his people will die. Unpleasantly. I believe them. So should you, Admiral.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Tell them I accept the conditions of negotiation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>KARNAS [on viewscreen]:  I will do so immediately. (transmission ends)</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>RIKER:  For a man in his position, he doesn't seem to know much about the situation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Wrong, Number One. He told me that the terrorists are desperate enough to kill if they're crossed. They are willing to talk, one on one, but not to him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>PICARD:  Counsellor?</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>TROI:  From his body language as well as his words and tone, I'd judge that what Karnas said was honest. But I sensed a holding back.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>PICARD:  Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he's prepared to admit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Possible, but I suspect it's closer to the mark if we said he doesn't want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate. He is a proud man.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>TROI:  That could be, sir. Karnas has established himself as a powerful man on Mordan. Suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>CRUSHER [OC]:  Sickbay to Bridge. I'm ready for Admiral Jameson now.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>PICARD:  In a few moments, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Ready for what, Captain?</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>PICARD:  Just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Ready room</td></tr>
<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>RIKER:  What I don't understand, sir, is how Karnas knew you were still available.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Still alive, you mean.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>RIKER:  So far as he knew, sir, you could have been dead.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Quite right, Commander, but I am not, and I imagine Ambassador Hawkins has told him that. I briefed the Ambassador about Mordan before he left to take up residence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>PICARD:  All right. Karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. What do the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them?</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>DATA:  Mordan has had peace for five years. They have finally come to a state of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs, but no more than that. Perhaps the dissidents feel the Federation could provide them with more.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>JAMESON:  I have negotiated many treaties on many planets, Picard. I've found that peace, or the appearance of it, is often a prelude to war.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>TROI:  Admiral, are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons?</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>JAMESON:  They may. I am suggesting Karnas is the last man to give them such weapons.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>TROI:  I see. You believe that Karnas would not negotiate on that point, and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>JAMESON:  I know Karnas. He is a warrior. He lives for challenge. These people have insulted his honour by taking the embassy staff hostage. I'll negotiate, but I'll have to be very careful in dealing with Karnas. He'll want revenge for that insult.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Except for one thing. The test results he gave me aren't two days old, they're two months old. The medical file coder always includes the date as part of the file number. He lied to me, sir, and I don't know why.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>PICARD:  He is eighty five years old, Doctor. For some, the memory begins to fail.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  He suffers from Iverson's Disease, sir. It affects the body, not the mind. No, I have a gut feeling he's hiding something.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>PICARD:  That is an observation I'd expect from Counsellor Troi. Doctor. Doctor, I do respect your opinion, and I'll want you on the Bridge for the next day or so. The Admiral must remain in the best of health for these negotiations, and he might require your services.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  Yes, quite.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>JAMESON:  Neglected to mention I began some new therapy before I left. Seems to be working. I haven't felt this good since the last time I was in space. The Gettysburg. All I needed to get me out of that chair was the thought of walking the decks in command of a starship again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>PICARD:  Then how do you account for it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>CRUSHER:  I can't. All I can tell you is that the Admiral has been confined to his support chair for the last four years by the effects of Iverson's. By all the medical facts we know, he should never have walked again.</td></tr>
