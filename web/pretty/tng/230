<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>DATA:  The object's enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetric interference. That might have prevented our sensors from detecting it before we dropped out of warp.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>PICARD:  Mister Data, could this be a Dyson Sphere?</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>DATA:  The object does fit the general parameters of Dyson's theory.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>PICARD:  It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised that you haven't heard of it. In the twentieth century, a physicist called Freeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage of harnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living on the interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources of power.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>DATA:  Possibly a great number of people, Commander. The interior surface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than two hundred and fifty million class M planets.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>DATA:  There are no life signs. However, there are several small power emanations, and life support is still functioning on minimal levels.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>RIKER:  This doesn't make any sense. Locking the unit in a diagnostic mode just sends the matter array through the pattern buffer. Why would anyone want to</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Those were replaced with isolinear chips about forty years ago. It's a lot more efficient now. That's an EPS power tap.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>SCOTT:  Aye, that's right. We had an overload in one of the plasma transfer conduits. The Captain brought us out of warp and we hit some gravimetric interference and then there it was, as big as life. Is that a conduit interface?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Yeah, it is. You were saying its big as life. You mean the Dyson Sphere?</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>SCOTT:  Well, we began a standard survey of the surface, and we were just completing the initial orbital scan when our aft power coils suddenly exploded. The ship got caught in the sphere's gravity well and down we went. Franklin and I were the only ones to survive the crash.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Can I ask you a question? What in the world made you think of using the transporter pattern buffer to survive?</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>SCOTT:  Well, we didn't have enough supplies to wait for a rescue, so we had to think of something.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Yeah, but locking it into a diagnostic cycle so that the pattern wouldn't degrade, and then cross-connecting it phase inducers to provide a regenerative power source, that's absolutely brilliant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>SCOTT:  I think it was only fifty percent brilliant. Franklin deserved better.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  I think you're going to enjoy the twenty fourth century, Mister Scott. We've made some pretty incredible advances these last eighty years.</td></tr>

<tr id="L307"><td><a href="#L307">307</a></td><td>LAFORGE:  Exactly. The Enterprise, when they saw that terminal, they probably did the same thing you did seventy five years ago. Opened a channel. Only this time they triggered something that activated that hatch and pulled the ship inside the sphere.</td></tr>

We might not be pulled inside when the hatch opens if we keep our distance from the sphere. Say, half million kilometres. Then when the hatch starts to close, we move in and we use the Jenolen to jam the hatch open, hoping that the Enterprise will escape.</td></tr>
