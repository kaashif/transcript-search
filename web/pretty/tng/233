  PICARD
     And I found these pieces in the tertiary level of
     the dig. They're typical of second century
     Marlonian cookware. Look at those markings.
     They're very similar to early Taguan designs, but
     the patterns are more intricate, they're much
     closer to Buranian than Taguan.

  GUINAN
     You were on the most beautiful planet in the
     quadrant and you spent your entire shore leave in
     a cave?

  PICARD
     It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these
     fragments. They're very nearly in perfect
     condition and yet they're seven hundred years old.

  GUINAN
     So's my father.

  RO
     Is that a Draebidium froctus?

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko has a tray of plants on her lap

  KEIKO
     Actually, it's a Draebidium calimus. You can tell
     by the shape of the leaves. I didn't know you were
     interested in plant biology.

  RO
     I took a class at the Academy. I Don't remember
     very much though.

  WORF [OC]
     Enterprise to shuttlecraft Fermi.

  RO
     This is the Fermi. Go ahead Enterprise.

  WORF [OC]
     We have just received a distress signal from the
     Starfleet science team on Ligos Seven.

  PICARD
     Can you identify the problem?

  WORF [OC]
     No, sir. The call was cut off in mid-transmission.

  PICARD
     Lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp
     eight as soon as we're on board.

  WORF [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  RO
     We'll rendezvous with the ship in three minutes,
     sir.

  ANNOTATION
     but then they enter a blue swirly thing

  RO
     We're caught in some kind of energy field.

  PICARD
     Hard about, full impulse.

  RO
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     What's happening, Mister Worf?

  WORF
     The shuttle has been enveloped by an energy field.
     It's engines and life support have failed.

  RIKER
     Increase to full impulse. Bridge to Transporter
     room three. Prepare to beam the shuttle crew back
     once we're in range.

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     Ready, sir.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  RO
     I can't contact the Enterprise. There's too much
     interference.

  PICARD
     Transfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers.

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Structural failure imminent.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Have you got them, O'Brien?

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     I'm trying, sir.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  O'BRIEN
     I can't get a pattern lock.

  RIKER [OC]
     The shuttle is


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Coming apart, Chief. We've got to do it now.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  O'BRIEN
     I've got them. There's a forty percent drop in
     mass.


LOCATION--Bridge

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     I may have lost one of them.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Four children dressed the same as the shuttle
     occupants appear. The tall skinny youth in
     Starfleet uniform, with a healthy crop of hair,
     speaks

  PICARD JR
     Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Another moment and

  ANNOTATION
     he stops, startled by his own high-pitched voice,
     and looks at his diminutive companions. Gulp.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     According to the bioscans, their DNA structure is
     now consistent with those of preadolescence. But
     as far as we can tell, only their bodies were
     changed.

  TROI
     Their individual intelligence and their
     behavioural responses are exactly the same as they
     were before the accident.

  PICARD JR
     What happened to the shuttlecraft, Number One?

  RIKER
     The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out.
     Mister Data is coordinating the salvage efforts
     now. Sir.

  CRUSHER
     What about the energy field the shuttle passed
     through?

  RIKER
     We've trying to scan it, but it's we're running
     into lot of interference. It's going to take some
     time.

  PICARD JR
     We can't afford to stay here any longer. We'll
     leave a class four probe behind to study the
     energy field but the distress signal from Ligos
     Seven has top priority. Let me know as soon as you
     have any further information, Doctor. Number One,
     you're with me.

  CRUSHER
     Captain, I need to run some additional tests.

  PICARD JR
     Of course. The three of you will remain as needed
     to assist Doctor Crusher.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker and Picard leave

  RO JR
     What?

  GUINAN JR
     You know, you make a pretty cute kid.

  RO JR
     Great. Just what I want to be. Cute.

  GUINAN JR
     Were you this much fun when you were a kid?

  RO JR
     I was in a refugee camp. Fun wasn't exactly in my
     vocabulary.

  GUINAN JR
     What about now? You're not in that camp anymore.

  RO JR
     Fun is being back at work in my own uniform.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  PICARD JR
     Bridge.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD JR
     Mister Worf. Prepare to launch a class four probe
     to study the energy field.

  ANNOTATION
     everyone just stares

  PICARD JR
     I realise how unusual this must seem. My
     appearance is the result of an accident, involving
     myself and three other crew members, the effects
     of which Doctor Crusher is currently working to
     remedy. I assure you I am Captain Picard.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker gives a nod

  WORF
     The probe. Aye, sir.

  PICARD JR
     Mister Data, have you secured all of the shuttle
     debris?

  DATA
     Almost. It is being stored in shuttlebay two. Sir.

  PICARD JR
     Very well. Ensign, as soon as Mister Data is
     finished take us to Ligos at warp eight.

  CRUSHER
     Captain, may I see you privately for a few
     moments?

  PICARD JR
     Of course.


LOCATION--Ready room

  PICARD JR
     Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. Have you been able to
     determine the cause of our transformation?

  CRUSHER
     Not yet. I'm still waiting for some test results.

  PICARD JR
     I see. There are one hundred and three members of
     the science team on Ligos Seven. We should prepare
     shuttlebay three for a triage centre in case they
     have large numbers of casualties.

  CRUSHER
     We'll be ready.

  PICARD JR
     I see that Ligos Seven is prone to periodic
     volcanic activity. Perhaps the planet has entered
     an active phase.

  CRUSHER
     Jean-Luc. We need to talk.

  PICARD JR
     All right. Let's talk. Are you here to relieve me
     of duty?

  CRUSHER
     I'd rather not have to take that step.

  PICARD JR
     I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My judgement, my
     experiences, my mental capacities are all intact.

  CRUSHER
     That's true, for now. But this could be the first
     stage of a condition that may begin to affect your
     mind as well.

  PICARD JR
     But you see no evidence of that.

  CRUSHER
     Not yet. What I do know is that the Captain of
     this ship has undergone an extreme physical
     transformation, the ultimate effects of which I
     can't even begin to guess.

  PICARD JR
     You are asking me to step down.

  CRUSHER
     You are still Jean-Luc Picard. What do you think
     you should do?


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD JR
     Commander Riker, please take command of the ship
     until further notice.

  RIKER
     Understood.


LOCATION--Corridor

  RO JR
     So what the hell am I supposed to do now?

  GUINAN JR
     You're not supposed to do anything. That's what
     relieved of duty means.

  RO JR
     Well, I should be doing something instead of just
     standing around waiting for them to find a cure.

  GUINAN JR
     You're right. Let's go play.

  RO JR
     What?

  GUINAN JR
     I haven't been young for a long time and I intend
     to enjoy every minute of it.

  RO JR
     Fine. Enjoy yourself.

  GUINAN JR
     What are you going to do? Go back to your room and
     pout?

  RO JR
     I am not twelve years old. If I want to go to my
     quarters and contemplate my situation, that does
     not mean that I am pouting.

  GUINAN JR
     Okay, okay.


LOCATION--O'Brien quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko wants the mister from an upper shelf, and
     has to stand on a box to get it before she can
     spray the orchid

  O'BRIEN
     I could use a cup of coffee. How about you?

  KEIKO JR
     I'll get it. Two coffees. One with cream and
     sugar, the other

  O'BRIEN
     Black, double sweet

  KEIKO JR
     I know. One double sweet.

  O'BRIEN
     Careful, that's hot.

  KEIKO JR
     Miles.

  O'BRIEN
     Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     She snuggles up to his and he gets up and walks
     away

  KEIKO JR
     What's wrong?

  O'BRIEN
     It's. I don't know, but this feels wrong somehow.

  KEIKO JR
     Miles Edward O'Brien, I am still your wife.

  O'BRIEN
     Well technically, yes.

  KEIKO JR
     Technically?

  O'BRIEN
     No. I mean, of course you're my wife. But you're
     also ten years old.

  KEIKO JR
     Beverly said it's actually closer to twelve.

  O'BRIEN
     That's not the point.

  KEIKO JR
     So what is the point? Is our marriage over?

  O'BRIEN
     I didn't say that. But until they find a way to
     reverse this, this effect, it's going hard for me
     to ignore the fact that you're a little girl.

  KEIKO JR
     What if they can't find a way? What if I'm like
     this the rest of my life? What does that mean for
     us, for our family?

  MOLLY [OC]
     Mommy? Mommy.


LOCATION--Molly's bedroom

  O'BRIEN
     What's wrong, Sweetheart?

  MOLLY
     I want Mommy to read me a story.

  KEIKO JR
     All right. What story would you like to hear?

  MOLLY
     Not you. I want Mommy.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko leaves

  O'BRIEN
     What if Daddy reads you a story tonight? Will that
     be okay? I'll be right back.


LOCATION--O'Brien quarters

  O'BRIEN
     Keiko. It's going to be all right. I promise.
     We'll work this out.

  KEIKO JR
     How?

  O'BRIEN
     I don't know.

  SOMEONE
     First Officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise
     has reached the Ligos system, and we have begun to
     search for the missing Federation science team.
     Doctor Crusher reports no progress on a cure for
     the members of the shuttle crew.


LOCATION--Picard's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Picard is enjoying running his fingers through his
     hair again, and puts on the jacket when the
     doorbell rings

  PICARD JR
     Come.

  TROI
     I came to see how you're doing.

  PICARD JR
     I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm
     well, thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't
     really take myself seriously like this.
     Counsellor, if Doctor Crusher can't find a cure,
     if I have to stay this way, nobody's going to take
     me seriously, are they?

  TROI
     I would say the people that know you and have
     worked with you, will be able to make the
     adjustment eventually. But there are some people
     who would find it difficult to accept a twelve
     year old captain.

  PICARD JR
     In that case, I suppose I'll just have to wait
     until I grow up again before I get another
     command. Which might be in ten, maybe fifteen
     years. The question is what to do until then?

  TROI
     You're still a Starfleet captain. I'm sure there
     are other assignments you could be given in the
     interim.
