Collateral Damage
TEASER

LOCATION--ALIEN CITY ON PLANET GALAR, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The city is large and very modern, with many high
     rises, parks, and an elevated monorail. It has a
     clean and efficient appearance.


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is lying on the floor, his closed eyes
     twitching as if in a dream state.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell recalls a series of events in brief,
     disconnected moments.


LOCATION--RECEPTION AREA, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Reya Varrick smiles as she walks slowly.


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sees the point of view of a person as he
     walks down a hallway. The person picks up a small
     but heavy black stone statue from a wet bar.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Varrick kiss passionately in several
     disconnected sequences.

  ANNOTATION
     The person moves down a hallway toward the dining
     room. Varrick appears and falls to the ground as
     if struck, crying out. She cries for help and
     crawls away as the attacker follows.


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell opens his eyes.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The attacker hits Varrick with the statue; she
     calls for help and turns over onto her back. He
     hits her again.


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell groans and rolls onto his back. He lifts
     his hands and sees that they are covered in dried
     blood. He blinks rapidly.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Visible and dressed in BDU's, Mitchell hits
     Varrick twice with the statue, with great force,
     as she cries out. He drops the statue and looks at
     his blood-covered hands. He appears very upset by
     what he has done.


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sits up slowly. There is a pounding at
     the door of the house.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     Open up the door!

  ANNOTATION
     There is the sound of the door crashing open.
     Police enter the room and one pulls Mitchell's
     hands behind his back to secure them.

  OFFICER
     I got him.

  MITCHELL
     What the hell's goin' on?

  ANNOTATION
     A security officer dressed in a modern-style
     uniform enters.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     Colonel Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     (confused, stressed) Yeah. What happened?

  ANNOTATION
     The officer ties Mitchell's hands together with a
     zip tie and drags him up to stand.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     Bring him.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk Mitchell from where he has been lying
     into the dining room. They guide him around the
     dining table to see Dr. Varrick lying dead on the
     floor, a pool of blood under her head and the
     statue lying next to her body.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, my God.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     Colonel Mitchell? I'm placing you under arrest for
     the murder of Dr. Reya Varrick.

  TWENTY-FOUR HOURS EARLIER



LOCATION--GALARAN LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is seated with his eyes closed. Six
     lighted sensors are attached to his head.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is dressed in a Galaran suit, standing in
     the dining room. He gazes out the window to see a
     large, ringed gaseous planet in the night sky.
     Behind him, Dr. Varrick enters, her hair hanging
     loose as she puts on a robe.

  VARRICK
     I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Emissary. I wasn't
     expecting anyone.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell speaks in a formal, slightly halting
     style, clearly not himself.

  MITCHELL
     (turning away from the window toward her) And I
     apologize for coming so late. But the committee
     just completed its deliberations.

  VARRICK
     You've chosen a new leader for the project.

  MITCHELL
     Yes, we have. (he sets down a large brandy-style
     snifter) Congratulations.

  VARRICK
     I'm honored.

  MITCHELL
     (touching the sleeve of her robe in a vaguely
     suggestive manner) We expect great things from
     you, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick folds her arms as if to warn him off.

  MITCHELL
     Along with your new responsibilities, you will
     have a higher security clearance. You already know
     about the ring, of course.

  VARRICK
     Yes, sir.

  MITCHELL
     What you don't know is that we've used it to visit
     over a dozen inhabited worlds, and there may be
     thousands more out there.

  VARRICK
     (shocked) My God.

  MITCHELL
     As Ambassador to those worlds, I've seen
     first-hand the kind of technologies that exist in
     the galaxy. Giant ships, capable of traveling
     between the stars. Weapons of immeasurable power.
     Galar is vulnerable, Doctor. The project may be
     our only hope for survival.

  VARRICK
     We'll do our best, sir.


LOCATION--GALARAN LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell opens his eyes and sits up rapidly.
     Varrick is standing beside the blue lounge-style
     chair he has been seated in. The chair sits alone
     on a raised platform surrounded by lighted panels.
     Outside this alcove is an area surrounded by walls
     of computers and several display terminals at a
     central control station. The rest of SG-1 and the
     Emissary look on from the control area. The
     Emissary smiles at Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     Wow.

  VARRICK
     Colonel? How do you feel?

  MITCHELL
     (turning in the chair to face her) That's just
     weird. I was having a conversation with you. It
     was about a year ago, but we just met yesterday.

  EMISSARY
     (stepping forward toward Mitchell) I was the one
     who had a conversation with Doctor Varrick. What
     you experienced was my memory.

  DANIEL
     That's amazing.

  EMISSARY
     Oh, believe me, Doctor Jackson, this is just the
     beginning.

  VARRICK
     (removing the leads from Mitchell's head) The
     memory was copied from the Emissary's mind and
     spliced into yours. Once there, it was
     incorporated into your consciousness, like a
     transplant organ becoming part of a new body.

  MITCHELL
     I could swear I was there.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets up from the chair and walks down the
     platform steps to stand beside Daniel, Carter, and
     Teal'c.

  MITCHELL
     I don't really know what we were talking about,
     but we were talking.

  VARRICK
     (moving to stand beside the Emissary, facing SG-1)
     Of course this was just a small demonstration.
     We're still perfecting the process. But we
     believe, eventually, the device will become an
     invaluable educational tool.

  EMISSARY
     Imagine your most brilliant surgeons or engineers
     instantaneously transferring the full memory of
     their education and experience to young students.
     You could conceivably cut their training time from
     years to mere weeks.

  CARTER
     And you say you adapted this technology from a
     Goa'uld memory device.

  VARRICK
     That's correct.

  DANIEL
     Well, if you don't mind our asking, where did you
     get your hands on one?

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick starts to answer but the Emissary
     interrupts.

  EMISSARY
     This planet has been under the protection of the
     Asgard for many generations, but it was originally
     occupied by the Goa'uld. That device was
     discovered by archaeologists over a hundred years
     ago. But it wasn't until recently that our
     understanding of the technology advanced to the
     point where we could create the memory transfer.
     It was Doctor Varrick who made the final
     breakthrough.

  VARRICK
     The Emissary's exaggerating. I was just the last
     in a long line of scientists working on the
     project.

  MITCHELL
     The last is the one who gets it right.

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick smiles at the compliment as the rest of
     SG-1 looks at Mitchell with dubious expressions.

  MITCHELL
     What?


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Landry are seated at the briefing table.

  CARTER
     The Galarans haven't perfected the memory implant
     technology to the point where it would have
     widespread applications, but from Colonel
     Mitchell's experience, it sounds like they're well
     on their way.

  DANIEL
     If they succeed, it could artificially accelerate
     their technological advancement.

  MITCHELL
     I think that's the point.

  DANIEL
     I'm saying it could be dangerous.

  LANDRY
     We're hardly in a position to judge, Doctor
     Jackson. For the past nine years, SG-1 has been
     routinely employing technologies that are well
     beyond our level of advancement.

  CARTER
     The Asgard are busy rebuilding, which means they
     haven't been around to do much protecting. The
     Galarans feel like they need to play catch-up.

  TEAL'C
     In all likelihood, that is the reason they are
     seeking a relationship with the Tau'ri. They are
     undoubtedly aware of our success against the
     Goa'uld.

  LANDRY
     So what exactly do they want? I mean aside from
     our goodwill and fellowship.

  CARTER
     Well, right now they have no interstellar
     capability except for the gate itself. They've
     been working on hyperdrive technology, but without
     much success.

  LANDRY
     And they want to offer this memory device in
     exchange for our help.

  DANIEL
     Well, the Emissary was reluctant to get into
     specifics. I think he wanted to whet our appetite
     for the technology before we started bargaining.

  LANDRY
     Well, it worked. The Joint Chiefs are already
     salivating over the idea of training jet pilots in
     a matter of days. We need to set up another
     meeting.

  CARTER
     No need, sir. We've already been invited back for
     a reception in honor of the scientists who
     developed the implant technology.

  MITCHELL
     I'm hoping there'll be dancing.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry looks at him in surprise.

  MITCHELL
     Sir.


LOCATION--GALARAN CITY, NIGHT


LOCATION--RECEPTION COURTYARD, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Galarans are talking and drinking in a courtyard
     with a large pool. They are dressed in formal
     attire, while SG-1 wear their BDU's. Mitchell
     walks with Varrick. They note a scientist standing
     alone next to the pool.

  MITCHELL
     Check that out. Even on an alien world, a
     wallflower.

  VARRICK
     Doctor Amuro. He's worked on the project for many
     years.

  MITCHELL
     It doesn't look like he's enjoying the party.

  VARRICK
     You know how it is with scientists. We spend so
     much time in the lab, I think that's where we feel
     most comfortable.

  MITCHELL
     In your case, I find that hard to believe.

  VARRICK
     Are you suggesting I don't work as hard as my
     colleagues?

  MITCHELL
     No, no. God, no. That's supposed to be a
     compliment.

  VARRICK
     (chuckling) Guess I'll have to take your word for
     it.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Teal'c, and Carter are chatting with the
     Emissary nearby.

  DANIEL
     No, it's not that I don't appreciate the potential
     of the technology, it's just that we're talking
     about your memory, here. It's fundamental to your
     identity. If you can't trust it, you're lost.

  EMISSARY
     Your memory is already less objective than you
     think it is, Doctor Jackson.

  CARTER
     Well, he's got a point. I mean, just ask any cop
     who's had to take eyewitness testimony.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, but there's a difference between getting a
     license plate number wrong and not knowing if the
     four years you spent in college ever actually
     happened.

  EMISSARY
     Yes, but that would never be the case, because
     everyone receiving the treatment would be aware of
     what they were getting.

  TEAL'C
     So long as the technology is not abused.

  EMISSARY
     Well, that's a risk with all new technologies.

  TEAL'C
     Easily said by one who has not been the victim of
     such abuse.

  EMISSARY
     (smiling) Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     The Emissary walks away.

  ANNOTATION
     Nearby, Dr. Marell approaches Mitchell and
     Varrick.

  MARELL
     Reya?

  VARRICK
     Doctor Marell? This is Lieutenant Colonel
     Mitchell.

  MARELL
     (smiling only briefly at Mitchell, then turning to
     Varrick) We have to talk.

  VARRICK
     (to Mitchell) Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick and Marell walk away. Mitchell appears
     puzzled. Carter, Daniel, and Teal'c approach him.

  CARTER
     How's it going?

  MITCHELL
     I don't think diplomacy is my thing.

  DANIEL
     (dryly) Oh, that's what you're doing.

  ANNOTATION
     The others smile at Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     What?

  DANIEL
     Nothing, nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes a drink from his glass.

  ANNOTATION
     Nearby, Marell hands a piece of paper to Varrick.
     She reads it then looks around them in shock. She
     sees the Emissary chatting to two others and heads
     toward him.

  MARELL
     Reya, wait.

  VARRICK
     (to Emissary, holding up the paper) Why wasn't I
     informed of this?

  EMISSARY
     (to the couple he is speaking with) Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     The couple walks away.

  EMISSARY
     Reya.

  VARRICK
     You moved up the test schedule, and you selected a
     group of volunteers. When did this happen?

  ANNOTATION
     Overhearing the conversation, Dr. Amuro begins to
     walk toward them, then stops listening. After a
     moment, he heads away purposefully.

  EMISSARY
     We've been very impressed with your progress. We
     thought it was time to take your research to its
     next level. You should take this as a compliment.

  VARRICK
     I notice all the test subjects are military
     officers. How should I take that?

  EMISSARY
     This is still a classified operation.

  VARRICK
     You gave me your personal assurance this project
     would remain under civilian control.

  EMISSARY
     And so it has. The military is simply making their
     contribution.

  VARRICK
     (raising her voice) Well, I've seen what those
     "contributions" can lead to.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 overhear her and turn to look.

  EMISSARY
     (annoyed and concerned about the looks they are
     getting) You're overreacting, and in any case,
     this is hardly the place to discuss it.

  VARRICK
     This conversation isn't over.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks away quickly. Mitchell looks on in
     concern.

  MITCHELL
     I'll be back.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads off to find her and sees her at the
     entrance to an interior hallway.

  MITCHELL
     Reya, wait up.

  ANNOTATION
     She stops and turns to look at him, agitated, her
     hands on her hips.

  MITCHELL
     What was all that about?

  VARRICK
     I should have seen this coming. They're going to
     take the project away from me.

  MITCHELL
     Why would they do that? You're the one that
     figured it out.

  VARRICK
     Which means they no longer need me. I know where
     this is coming from. It's the general staff. They
     want to control the technology without any
     interference from civilian scientists. I swore I
     wouldn't let that happen... Why am I telling you
     this? You're a military officer yourself. If you
     get your hands on the device, the same thing will
     happen on your planet.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns to walk away but stops when Mitchell
     calls out to her.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, I'm not a big fan of misusing technology on
     any planet. And I might be able to help you out.

  VARRICK
     (intrigued, stepping closer) What do you mean?

  MITCHELL
     Well, obviously your government is keen on forming
     a relationship with mine. That gives us some
     leverage.

  VARRICK
     You'd use your influence to help me?

  MITCHELL
     I could try.

  VARRICK
     (smiling a bit flirtatiously) Well. I really don't
     want to go back out there. Maybe you could do me a
     favor and walk me home? It's not far, but I don't
     like to walk alone at night.

  MITCHELL
     Really.

  VARRICK
     (laughing) Don't they have crime on your planet?

  ANNOTATION
     The Emissary approaches them, but they don't react
     to him.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     They head off together through a door onto the
     other side of the building. The Emissary looks on
     unhappily.


LOCATION--GALARAN CITY, NIGHT


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, ENTRY WAY

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick and Mitchell enter through the front door.
     Varrick activates the lights and walks over to a
     wet bar, which has glass shelves and a mirrored
     back. The statue sits on the counter. Mitchell
     takes in the scene.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, wow. Don't move.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up a hand and then looks around
     excitedly.

  MITCHELL
     (walking toward her) The night the Emissary told
     you that they put you in charge of the project, he
     came here, right?

  VARRICK
     (smiling) That's right.

  MITCHELL
     That's just weird. I mean, I know I've never been
     here before, but, I recognize this place.

  VARRICK
     Then you know where the drinks are. Help yourself,
     and pour me one, too.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks away, further into the house, as
     Mitchell looks on. He opens one of the carafes,
     smells its glass cork, and pours from it into a
     brandy-style glass.


LOCATION--VARRICK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN/DINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell walks in carrying a drink for each of
     them and hands one to Varrick. She has just
     lighted the fireplace.

  MITCHELL
     (noting the decor) It's impressive. Do all
     Government scientists live like this?

  VARRICK
     The success of the project has brought me a few
     privileges. Sometimes I feel a little guilty. Most
     of my colleagues from my days at the Academy don't
     live nearly so well.

  MITCHELL
     (holding out his glass in toast) Well, I'm sure
     you deserve it. (taking a sip of the drink and
     reacting to its strength) Wow.

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick laughs.

  MITCHELL
     (smiling but putting his glass down) That doesn't
     pull any punches, does it.

  VARRICK
     After the day I just had, that's the whole point.

  MITCHELL
     So, you live here on your own?

  VARRICK
     Why do you ask?

  MITCHELL
     Ah, it's a big place. I don't know, just--just
     curious, I guess.

  ANNOTATION
     Varrick steps in front of him and takes his jacket
     in her hands.

  VARRICK
     I thought that was your clever way of asking if I
     was married.

  MITCHELL
     I'm not that clever.

  VARRICK
     (getting closer to him) Well anyway, the answer's
     yes, I live alone. I was married for a while but
     the job got in the way.

  MITCHELL
     Well, that much I understand.

  VARRICK
     Then we're not so different after all.

  ANNOTATION
     She places her arms around his neck and kisses
     him; they kiss several times then pause.

  MITCHELL
     We shouldn't do this.

  VARRICK
     You wouldn't have come here if you didn't want to.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him again.

  MITCHELL
     Mmmm, I didn't say I didn't want to.

  ANNOTATION
     He kisses her, and they continue kissing.


LOCATION--GALARAN CITY, DAY


LOCATION--EMISSARY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Daniel and Teal'c are ushered in by
     guards. The Emissary is already there.

  CARTER
     Emissary, what's going on? Where's Colonel
     Mitchell?

  EMISSARY
     He's been taken into custody.

  DANIEL
     Why?

  EMISSARY
     He killed Doctor Varrick.

  CARTER
     (shocked) What?

  DANIEL
     That's insane.

  EMISSARY
     When we found him, his blood alcohol level was
     extremely high. I suspect it was probably some
     kind of unpremeditated crime of passion. We all
     know they left the reception together.

  CARTER
     That's hardly evidence.

  EMISSARY
     We also found her blood on his hands, and his
     fingerprints on the murder weapon. But most
     importantly, he confessed.


LOCATION--GALARAN JAIL

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sits on a bench inside a jail cell as the
     rest of SG-1 looks on from outside the cell bars.
     Mitchell is dressed in dark prison clothing with
     short sleeves. He appears quiet and withdrawn.

  CARTER
     Cam, what happened?

  MITCHELL
     (distraught and teary-eyed) I don't know. I mean,
     the whole night is just a blur.

  ANNOTATION
     In another flashback, he relives the scene in
     which Varrick falls to the floor in the dining
     room. He continues speaking as the murder plays
     out as it did before.

  MITCHELL
     I just remember feeling this insane anger. I don't
     know why. I picked up the statue, and I hit her
     with it. She was lying there, helpless, and I
     uh...

  DANIEL
     It wasn't you, okay? These people can implant
     memories.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, I've been trying to tell myself the same
     thing all morning. It doesn't stop me from still
     seeing her face. What if I told you everything
     that happened to you yesterday was a false memory?
     How would you know the difference?

  ANNOTATION
     As SG-1 looks on in concern the security officer
     who arrested Mitchell enters.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     The Emissary would like to speak with the
     prisoner.


LOCATION--EMISSARY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     All of SG-1 is there, Mitchell still in the dark
     jail clothing.

  CARTER
     We need to talk about this so-called evidence you
     have against Colonel Mitchell.

  EMISSARY
     That won't be necessary. Colonel Mitchell is free
     to return to Earth.

  MITCHELL
     (shocked) I'm what?

  EMISSARY
     I'm trying to convince the Cabinet to maintain
     your diplomatic status, but I may not succeed.

  MITCHELL
     Whoa, wait a minute. If they think I'm guilty, why
     are they letting me go?

  EMISSARY
     They believe it is in the best interest of
     inter-planetary relations to put this difficult
     business behind us, as quickly and as quietly as
     possible.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell has been falsely accused.

  DANIEL
     Which means there still could be a murderer out
     there.

  EMISSARY
     Let's be realistic, here. Very few people have
     access to the memory device. Even fewer have the
     skills to manipulate it in this manner. And none
     that I can think of have any motive. Colonel
     Mitchell should be grateful. Under our rules of
     evidence, he would be convicted of this crime.

  MITCHELL
     (stepping forward, angry) I should be grateful to
     walk away and have this memory stuck in my head
     for the rest of my life?

  EMISSARY
     All right, then. If you agree to close the matter,
     we can have the incident removed from your mind
     and replace it with a memory of a pleasant,
     uneventful evening.

  MITCHELL
     Just like that. Forget it ever happened.

  EMISSARY
     Precisely. On the other hand, if you insist on a
     full investigation, I won't be able to protect
     you. If the evidence continues to point to your
     guilt, you will be subject to the full force of
     our laws. And the penalty for murder is death.

  CARTER
     (quietly) Cameron, we need to be really careful,
     here. We have no idea how their legal system
     works. We don't know what kind of rights--

  MITCHELL
     (emphatic) Sam. I need to do this. I want to know
     what really happened.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 minus Mitchell is there with Landry.

  LANDRY
     (angry) You can tell the Galarans that, until
     Colonel Mitchell is returned, all trade talks are
     suspended.

  DANIEL
     He doesn't want to come back. He wants to force
     them to conduct a full investigation.

  LANDRY
     I don't give a damn what he wants.

  DANIEL
     General, it's easy for us to sit here and be
     certain he didn't do it, but look at it from his
     point of view. No matter what we say, he's still
     going to have the memory of murdering that woman
     with his own hands.

  LANDRY
     You said the Emissary offered to have the memory
     removed.

  DANIEL
     He'd still know she'd been killed, and I'm sure
     he'd be curious why no one had been held
     accountable for it.

  LANDRY
     He's taking an awful chance.

  TEAL'C
     I believe it highly unlikely that the Galarans
     would execute Colonel Mitchell. It would severely
     hinder the possibility of future relations with
     the Tau'ri.

  CARTER
     Sir, I've already spoken to Doctor Marell. He says
     they can use the implant technology to determine
     if the memory's genuine or not.

  LANDRY
     (emphatic) I don't want him hooked up to that damn
     machine again without one of you present.

  CARTER
     I'll be observing the analysis. In the meantime,
     Teal'c and Daniel have been granted access to all
     the material relevant to the investigation.

  LANDRY
     (nodding) Very well.

     Landry stands and leaves.

LOCATION--GALARAN LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Drs. Marell and Amuro are studying computer
     displays at the control console for the chair.
     They move to the entrance as Carter and Mitchell
     enter with the security officer and other guards.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     Doctor Marell and Doctor Amuro will be conducting
     the analysis. Now, if there's anything else you
     require?

  CARTER
     As a matter of fact, there is. I understand that a
     sample of Colonel Mitchell's blood was taken when
     he was arrested.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     In order to determine his blood alcohol level,
     yes.

  CARTER
     We'd like a portion of that sample sent back to
     Stargate Command. Just to corroborate your
     results, of course.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     I'll see to it.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to leave.

  MARELL
     You can take the guards with you.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     This man has been accused of murder.

  MARELL
     I don't want them in my lab.

  SECURITY OFFICER
     (to guards) You can wait outside.

  ANNOTATION
     The officer and guards leave.

  MITCHELL
     Are you fellas sure you want to be left alone with
     me?

  AMURO
     Doctor Varrick was our colleague. If we thought
     for one minute you actually killed her, we
     wouldn't be helping you.

  CARTER
     Then who do you think did kill her?

  MARELL
     Reya was going to do everything she could to
     oppose the militarization of the project. So, they
     got rid of her.

  MITCHELL
     Why frame me?

  AMURO
     They assumed that you'd claim diplomatic immunity
     and therefore no prosecution would be necessary.
     The whole thing was to be swept under the carpet.

  MITCHELL
     They assumed wrong.

  MARELL
     And for that, we are grateful.

  CARTER
     Can you prove the memories false?

  AMURO
     Well, unfortunately Doctor Varrick was the most
     qualified to do this work, but...

  MITCHELL
     I'm sure you'll do fine.

  AMURO
     (leading Mitchell to the chair) Please.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves to stand near Marell at the control
     console while Amuro leads Mitchell to the chair.
     Carter appears concerned. Amuro connect the
     electronic leads to Mitchell's head. The display
     in front of Marell comes alive with various
     complicated wave patterns.

  MARELL
     Brain activity is extremely fluid. We can't read a
     memory like opening a drawer and pulling out a
     file. Patterns shift and mutate. One memory colors
     another.

  AMURO
     That's why it's so difficult to create a
     successful graft. You have to be careful not to
     cause too many inconsistencies.

  MARELL
     (turning from the console to face Mitchell) All
     right, Colonel. We need to establish a baseline.
     What I've done is identify a series of key
     memories from your childhood. These are seminal
     moments. They stand out like signposts, and they
     influence everything that came after them. I'm
     going to activate one now.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns back to the console and enters some
     commands. Mitchell closes his eyes and leans his
     head back as Amuro activates something behind the
     chair.

LOCATION--HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     A nurse approaches Young Mitchell, who is sitting
     on a bench in the corridor. She places her hand on
     his shoulder.

  CARTER
     (audibly only) You all right?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, it's just... weird.

  CARTER
     What are you seeing?

  MITCHELL
     I'm in the VA hospital where they brought my
     father right after his accident.

  CARTER
     He was a test pilot, right?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--HOSPITAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Young Mitchell comes to the doorway of the room,
     the nurse behind him. He steps into the room to
     see his father sitting on the hospital bed, his
     legs amputated above the knees and the remaining
     portions in bandages. A nurse is beside his
     father. The father sees Young Mitchell and
     immediately tries to sit up and turn sideways on
     the bed. The nurse helps him to turn. Young
     Mitchell looks closely at his father's missing
     legs. He then meets his father's eyes and smiles,
     and his father smiles back at him and sighs,
     relieved.

  MITCHELL
     It's the first time I saw him after the crash.
     Scared the hell out of me to see him like that.
     Somehow he made it seem that everything was going
     to be okay.

  MARELL
     (activating more buttons) We're moving into a
     related memory now.

  MITCHELL
     (eyelids flickering) It's a couple of months
     later.

  ANNOTATION
     As Mitchell continues talking, he sees a flashback
     of himself as the young boy, sitting on the
     hospital bed beside his father, watching
     television.

  MITCHELL
     We're watching the launch of the first Space
     Shuttle. Ah, I can't be much more than ten years
     old.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--HOSPITAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     With his father's arm around him, Young Mitchell
     watches the Space Shuttle lift off of its launch
     pad.

  MITCHELL'S FATHER
     Go baby, go! What do you think of that, Cam? Space
     planes. I tell you what, if they can pull that
     off, the least I can do is walk again, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Young Mitchell smiles.

  ANNOTATION
     Amuro removes the leads from Mitchell's head.

  AMURO
     Well done, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sits up.

  MITCHELL
     So, what's next?

  MARELL
     With this data, we should be able to precisely
     calibrate the equipment, and then comes the hard
     part.

  AMURO
     We'll need to run through your memories of the
     murder. We may have to do it several times.

  MITCHELL
     (sarcastically) Great.


LOCATION--EMISSARY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c enter to meet the Emissary,
     already there.

  EMISSARY
     (standing) Teal'c, Doctor Jackson, what can I do
     for you?

  DANIEL
     (holding up a small computer memory chip) We've
     got a problem. Uh, this data file was supposed to
     contain all materials relevant to the murder
     investigation, but large sections of Dr. Varrick's
     personal records have been deleted.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel hands the chip to the Emissary.

  EMISSARY
     Well, she was involved in a number of our most
     top-secret projects. The deletions were made in
     the interest of national security. But I'm sure
     there's nothing in the missing material that has
     any bearing on the investigation.

  TEAL'C
     How are we to be certain?

  EMISSARY
     Because I'm telling you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes the chip back from the Emissary; he
     appears frustrated.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell relives his conversations with Varrick at
     the cocktail party, then sees himself hitting her
     with the statue as she screams. He seems himself
     kissing her, then waking up with blood on his
     hands. He relives seeing her dead body in the
     morning.


LOCATION--GALARAN LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is in the chair, still reliving memories,
     as Carter, Amuro, and Marell look on.

  AMURO
     We must be missing something.

  MARELL
     We've been through it three times.

  CARTER
     What's the problem?

  AMURO
     Well, maybe we should run another diagnostic--

  MARELL
     (angry, pointing at the display) It's not going to
     change the result! (getting up to leave) I need
     some air.

  ANNOTATION
     Marell leaves the lab.

  AMURO
     (to Carter) So far, we can't find any evidence
     that the memory is false. According to these
     results, Colonel Mitchell really did murder Doctor
     Varrick.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns to look at Mitchell, who is still
     reliving his memories. Carter leaves the lab to
     find Marell standing outside in the corridor.

  CARTER
     Doctor Marell, you have to continue with the
     analysis. Please. You know he didn't to this!

  MARELL
     That's not what the machine says.

  CARTER
     Look, I know Doctor Varrick was your friend--

  MARELL
     (growing more upset) She was more than than,
     Colonel... She was my wife. We'd been separated
     for two years. I guess I was still hoping there
     might be a ch-- I can't help you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter appears shocked and worried.

LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Landry is seated at his desk as Harriman enters.

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, Doctor Lam is in surgery, but she wanted you
     to see this right away.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands a yellow folder to Landry.

  HARRIMAN
     It's the results of the analysis of Colonel
     Mitchell's blood sample.

  LANDRY
     (opening the folder to read) Anything useful?

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir. She wanted you to know that the
     troponins were negative, but the CK and the
     myoglobins were up. No, wait. Uh, the myoglobins
     were negative, but the CK and the troponins were
     up. No, wait--

  LANDRY
     Walter.

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, whatever it was, it means that when the
     sample was taken, Colonel Mitchell had been
     recently either stunned or rendered unconscious by
     some kind of electrical charge.

  LANDRY
     Like a Zat gun.

  HARRIMAN
     (uncertainly) Yes, sir. Or some such... similar...
     uh, thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry grunts and waits for more. When nothing is
     forthcoming, he holds his hands out in question.
     Harriman takes the hint and leaves. Landry shakes
     his head.


LOCATION--EMISSARY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c are speaking to the
     Emissary, having just given him the blood test
     results.

  EMISSARY
     This is hardly proof of Colonel Mitchell's
     innocence.

  DANIEL
     Wow, on Earth you have to prove guilt. (noting the
     Emissary's dubious expression) I know, we're not
     on Earth.

  EMISSARY
     I'll admit, it's enough to suggest to them that
     the investigation should continue. But Doctor
     Marell has expressed reluctance to help you any
     further.

  CARTER
     At least let us talk to him.


LOCATION--GALARAN LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, Marell, and Amuro are standing near the
     empty chair.

  MITCHELL
     I'm sorry about Reya. She told me she'd been
     married. She didn't tell me it was you.

  MARELL
     Would it have made any difference?

  MITCHELL
     I didn't kill her.

  MARELL
     Even if I wanted to help you, there's nothing more
     I can do.

  CARTER
     Why not?

  AMURO
     Well, as you know, we used Colonel Mitchell's own
     memories to establish a comparative standard. And
     normally that should have been enough to identify
     any false readings, but we were unable to do so.
     Which means either the memory is genuine, or the
     transfer was so expertly done that the ordinary
     methods of detecting it are useless.

  TEAL'C
     What other methods are there?

  MARELL
     Well, the only way would be to compare what
     happened the other night with a genuine memory of
     similar content and emotional resonance. So unless
     Colonel Mitchell's made a habit of killing
     innocent people... we're out of options.

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of SG-1 look dubious that Mitchell would
     have such a memory.

  MITCHELL
     I may have what you need.

  ANNOTATION
     The others look on in surprise.

  MITCHELL
     Hook me up.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell steps up to the platform and seats
     himself in the chair again.

  ANNOTATION
     Some time later, Marell and Amuro are examining
     Mitchell's brain wave displays.

  MARELL
     (pointing to a series of colored bars) There it
     is.

  DANIEL
     What are we looking at?

  AMURO
     The emotional resonance pattern of this memory is
     very similar to that of Doctor Varrick's murder.

  ANNOTATION
     In the chair, Mitchell is clearly experiencing a
     strong memory.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--SKY ABOVE MIDDLE EASTERN DESERT, EARTH, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is piloting an F-16 fighter. He is

     here, boys and girls. Can I get a confirmation on
     that target?

  MUSTANG LEADER
     Mustang Three, you are cleared hot. Repeat, you
     are cleared hot.

  MITCHELL
     Are we sure about this?

  MUSTANG LEADER
     That's affirmative. Pop up to fifteen-hundred for
     re-acquisition.

  MITCHELL
     Roger that.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell moves the throttle to full afterburner,
     and the aircraft climbs rapidly. He moves the
     weapons switch to 'master arm'.

     What? No! No no no no! The bomb is away. What the
     hell is going on, Mustang Leader?

  MUSTANG LEADER
     We've lost confirmation on the target.

  MITCHELL
     You've gotta be kidding me.

  MUSTANG LEADER
     Can you confirm hit?

  MITCHELL

LOCATION--MILITARY COMMAND BASE OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is speaking to his superior officer from

  COLONEL DAVIDSON
     Sorry about that, Captain. We were relying on
     local allied intelligence. Obviously someone
     dropped the ball.

  MITCHELL
     (distraught) Who was the target? Was he in the
     convoy or not?

  COLONEL DAVIDSON
     Don't do this to yourself.

  MITCHELL
     (insistent) Who was in the convoy, sir?

  COLONEL DAVIDSON
     As far as we know, it was a group of refugees.
     This wasn't your fault.

  MITCHELL
     That doesn't change the fact that I have to live
     with it for the rest of my life.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell opens his eyes and sits up, breathing
     heavily. Carter goes to help him remove the leads.

     We're analyzing the results now. Just give us a
     few moments.

  ANNOTATION
     The data screen shows the two similar memories
     being superimposed, with several points
     highlighted by the computer. Mitchell sits down
     heavily at the top of the platform stairs, clearly
     upset. Carter sits beside him.

  CARTER
     You okay?

  MITCHELL
     No.

  MARELL
     It worked. The new data indicates that the memory
     of Reya's murder was implanted.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell smiles in relief, though he is nearly
     crying.

  CARTER
     Thank God.

  AMURO
     (getting up) I'll inform the Emissary.

  MITCHELL
     (upset and teary-eyed) Hang on a second. We may
     have proved that I didn't kill her, but we're not
     finished, not by a long shot. (to Carter) I have
     to know who did it, and I'm not leaving here until
     we find out.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is back in the chair with Amuro wiring
     him up to it.

  CARTER
     What exactly are we looking for?

  MARELL
     Because we know the memory was implanted, we can
     expect to find anomalies. Little moments where the
     brain is simply incapable of dealing with the
     inconsistencies that arise as a result of the
     graft. Often, these take the form of missing time
     or sudden changes in the identities of people
     around us. Typically they center on the splice
     points, where the memory starts and stops.

  AMURO
     The problem is, they can often be difficult to
     detect.

  ANNOTATION
     Amuro and Marell head to the control console.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, Sam... thanks.

LOCATION--EMISSARY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     The Emissary is sitting in a chair holding a
     cocktail as Daniel and Teal'c enter.

  DANIEL
     You wanted to see us?

  EMISSARY
     I understand Doctor Marell and Doctor Amuro were
     able to determine that the memory was an implant.
     I must say, I'm relieved. A trial could have been
     extremely detrimental to relations between our
     worlds.

  TEAL'C
     Not to mention inconvenient for Colonel Mitchell.

  EMISSARY
     Yes, of course. I'm sure he'd like to return to
     Earth as soon as possible.

  DANIEL
     Actually, he's still in the lab.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell believes that an analysis of the
     false memory could prove useful in determining the
     true identity of the murderer.

  EMISSARY
     I'm sorry. (he sets down his cocktail glass) But I
     won't allow it. (standing and moving to his desk)
     We've already been more than generous in putting
     our most important scientists and facilities at
     your disposal to determine Colonel Mitchell's
     innocence. But now it's time that they got back to
     their research.

  DANIEL
     Look, all we're asking for is a little more time.

  EMISSARY
     The project is already behind schedule. Doctor
     Marell is the most qualified to lead the research
     now, and his new responsibilities preclude him
     from participating in this investigation any more.

  DANIEL
     Colonel Mitchell was assaulted. His memories were
     manipulated against his will, and an innocent
     woman was murdered. Now I've only worked with the
     guy a short time, but I'm pretty sure he's not
     going to let this one go. And if you want to get
     in his way, let's just say, when it comes time to
     decide if we want to pursue this relationship, his
     opinion's going to carry a lot of weight.

  CARTER

  MITCHELL
     No, I'm good.

  AMURO
     Are you sure you want to continue this? It's
     possible that there are no anomalies or that they
     could be buried so deep, we'll never find them
     even if we go over it a hundred times.

  MITCHELL
     It's the least I can do for her now. Let's keep
     going.

  AMURO
     All right.

  ANNOTATION
     Time passes, and the scientists continue watching
     the readouts as Mitchell relives the memories.

  AMURO
     There's nothing here.

  MARELL
     There has to be. I'll find it.

  AMURO
     Marell, I know she meant a lot to you, but how
     much longer can we put the poor man through this?

  MARELL
     (insistent) He wants to do it. Look, we know the
     memory is false by comparison. There must be some
     other indication.

  AMURO
     (frustrated) We've been through this a dozen
     times. The splice points are indistinguishable.

  MARELL
     I know, but I now realize that's because he was
     rendered unconscious before the procedure was
     begun. And he was still unconscious long after it
     was completed. The whole thing has the quality of
     a dream. It's jumbled up in his mind.

  AMURO
     All right, so what can we do about it?

  MARELL
     Focus on the inconsistencies in the memory itself.

  AMURO
     Well, what if there aren't any?

  MARELL
     (exasperated) I'm wasting my time explaining this
     to you. Can I do my work?

  ANNOTATION
     Amuro stands and walks over to Carter.

  AMURO
     How's he doing?

  CARTER
     Not too good. It doesn't sound like you're making
     a lot of progress.

     On the display screen, the computer notes a point
     of interest.

  MARELL
     I've got something. There, you see it?

  ANNOTATION
     Marell indicates the point on the display.

  AMURO
     Yes.

  CARTER
     What is it?

  MARELL
     It's what we've been looking for. Colonel
     Mitchell, can you hear me?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  MARELL
     We've identified a point in the memory where we
     think there may be an anomaly. I'm going to
     activate it now. I want you to tell me what you
     see.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell walks down the hallway toward the wet
     bar.

  MITCHELL
     I'm in the house. I'm walking down the hallway.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     He walks past the wet bar and sees his own
     reflection in the glass behind the bar. Suddenly
     he is chasing Varrick and attacking her.

  MITCHELL
     Whoa. No, I've--I've lost it. Go back.

  MARELL
     Just a minute.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sees himself walk backward past the wet
     bar mirror, as if in reverse. His face looks
     different, distorted.

  MITCHELL
     Stop! There. Can you run it again? Maybe slow it
     down a little.

  ANNOTATION
     Marell nods and enters some commands.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell walks forward in front of the mirror. He
     is dressed in BDU's, but his face is very
     distorted.

  MITCHELL
     I see my reflection... my reflection in the
     mirror. But the face is blurry.

  MARELL
     It's an anomaly. If the reflection in the mirror
     is not your own, your brain can't deal with it.
     That's why it's blurry.

  MITCHELL
     Can you clean it up?

  MARELL
     Uh, I think so.

  ANNOTATION
     He manipulates the controls again.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sees a figure walk in front of the mirror
     again. This time, the face is clearly Marell's,
     and he is wearing the suit he wore to the
     reception.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell wakes up suddenly and sits forward,
     staring at Marell.

  CARTER
     What did you see? Who was it?

  MITCHELL
     (pointing at Marell, amazed) It was him.

  ANNOTATION
     Marell huffs in disbelief.

  CARTER
     Are you sure?

  MITCHELL
     (ripping the leads off of his head and standing)
     Positive. It was Marell.

  AMURO
     That's impossible. If he killed her, why would he
     be helping us? I mean, he wanted to reveal the
     identity of the murderer more than anyone.

  CARTER
     What if he doesn't know?

  AMURO
     What, you're saying he killed her and then
     implanted the memory in Colonel Mitchell?

  CARTER
     And then erased it from his own mind.

  MITCHELL
     Is that possible?

  AMURO
     Theoretically yes, but--

  MARELL
     (standing) This is insane! I loved her!

  MITCHELL
     But she left you, didn't she. And you never got
     over it. Then you saw me leave the party with her.

  MARELL
     (sincere, certain) Look, it's impossible!

  AMURO
     Well, there's one way to find out for sure. If he
     really did erase his own memory, he would have had
     to replace it with something else. We can check
     for anomalies the same way we did with Colonel
     Mitchell.

  MARELL
     (unconcerned) Go ahead. You won't find anything.


LOCATION--GALARAN CITY, DAY


LOCATION--EMISSARY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Amuro are speaking to the Emissary.

  AMURO
     We found that he had two identical memories. One
     from the night of the murder and one from several
     nights before. Except no two memories are exactly
     the same. It's like signatures. When they're
     identical, that's when you know that they've been
     forged. As far as he knows, he was in bed sleeping
     the whole time.

  CARTER
     He didn't just want to fool us, he wanted to fool
     himself. To get rid of the guilt.

  MITCHELL
     And that's what did him in.

  ANNOTATION
     The Emissary appears to consider what he has
     learned.


LOCATION--GALARAN LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is once again in the chair, the memory
     device leads attached and active. Amuro
     manipulates controls at the back of the chair and
     smiles.

  AMURO
     We're done.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell sits up.

  CARTER
     How do you feel?

  MITCHELL
     Fine, I guess.

  ANNOTATION
     They both remove the leads from his head.

  AMURO
     I've erased the implants. You should no longer
     have the image of killing Doctor Varrick in your
     mind. But all of your genuine memories should be
     intact.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell recalls kissing Varrick in her home.

  MITCHELL
     I still remember her. Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Marell enters the lab, followed by the Emissary.
     He is smiling and relaxed.

  MARELL
     (shaking hands with Amuro) Doctor Amuro. (to
     Carter and Mitchell) And you must be our visitors
     from Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Mitchell and Amuro appear shocked.

  AMURO
     Are you all right?

  MARELL
     Well, no. Obviously you've heard what happened to
     Reya. To be honest, I still can't believe she's
     really gone. But I talked it over with the
     Emissary, and we both agreed that the best thing
     for me now is to get back to work... It was nice
     to meet you.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away from their shocked looks, unaware of
     anything amiss. Amuro follows him down to the
     control console, out of earshot.

  MITCHELL
     (to the Emissary) What the hell is this?

  EMISSARY
     He thinks she died in an accident, and he'll
     continue to think that for the rest of his life.

  CARTER
     You're just going to let him get away with murder?

  EMISSARY
     He doesn't know he killed her. There was no way to
     recover that memory.

  MITCHELL
     (standing, intently) And that's supposed to make
     it okay?

  EMISSARY
     It was for the good of the project. And Doctor
     Varrick would have understood that.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY


LOCATION--SGC LOCKER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is in the locker room, getting dressed in
     civilian clothing. Landry enters.

  LANDRY
     I read your report. I'm not sure I've ever seen
     language like that used in an official Air Force
     document before.

  MITCHELL
     (facing his locker as Landry approaches) Sorry
     about that, sir.

  LANDRY
     Oh, you should have seen what Colonel Carter and
     Doctor Jackson wrote.

  MITCHELL
     (still looking away from Landry) Yes, sir.

  LANDRY
     Colonel Carter told me what you had to do to prove
     your innocence. Something about reliving a
     difficult memory. Of course, uh, she didn't know
     what it was all about. She hasn't read your
     service record like I have.

  MITCHELL
     I hadn't thought about it in a long time. But, I
     guess something like that never goes away, does
     it.

  LANDRY
     No.

  MITCHELL
     (facing Landry) When it happened, I almost
     resigned my commission.

  LANDRY
     (patting him on the shoulder) I'm glad you didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry leaves. Mitchell opens his locker door and
     looks at a more recent picture of himself with his
     father.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--A PUBLIC PARK, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and his father walk side-by-side in a
     park, with a child and two adults playing frisbee
     behind them. His father uses crutches to walk.

  MITCHELL'S FATHER
     I understand how you feel. But leaving the Air
     Force won't change what happened, won't make you
     feel any better.

  MITCHELL
     You know, you suck at pep talks, Dad.

  MITCHELL'S FATHER
     Well, I'm just being realistic. What else are you
     going to do? Become an airline pilot? Fly the New
     York--DC shuttle five times a day? Mow the lawn on
     Sundays?

  MITCHELL
     That doesn't sound too bad.

  MITCHELL'S FATHER
     Yeah, well, for someone else, maybe. But not for
     you. It'd been easier if you'd grown up to be more
     like your mother. But you're just like me. Always
     looking to the horizon, always looking for
     something more.

  MITCHELL
     But I'm not like you, Dad. I'm not that strong.

  MITCHELL'S FATHER
     Ah, that's where you're wrong, kid. You just don't
     know it yet.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell's father moves away as Mitchell looks on,
     considering.


LOCATION--SGC LOCKER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell takes a last look at the picture, closes
     his locker door, and leaves.
