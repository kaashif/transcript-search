<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>VARRICK: (removing the leads from Mitchell's head) The memory was copied from the Emissary's mind and spliced into yours. Once there, it was incorporated into your consciousness, like a transplant organ becoming part of a new body.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>MITCHELL: I could swear I was there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>VARRICK: (moving to stand beside the Emissary, facing SG-1) Of course this was just a small demonstration. We're still perfecting the process. But we believe, eventually, the device will become an invaluable educational tool.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>EMISSARY: Imagine your most brilliant surgeons or engineers instantaneously transferring the full memory of their education and experience to young students. You could conceivably cut their training time from years to mere weeks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>EMISSARY: This planet has been under the protection of the Asgard for many generations, but it was originally occupied by the Goa'uld. That device was discovered by archaeologists over a hundred years ago. But it wasn't until recently that our understanding of the technology advanced to the point where we could create the memory transfer. It was Doctor Varrick who made the final breakthrough.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>VARRICK: The Emissary's exaggerating. I was just the last in a long line of scientists working on the project.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>CARTER: The Galarans haven't perfected the memory implant technology to the point where it would have widespread applications, but from Colonel Mitchell's experience, it sounds like they're well on their way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>DANIEL: If they succeed, it could artificially accelerate their technological advancement.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>LANDRY: We're hardly in a position to judge, Doctor Jackson. For the past nine years, SG-1 has been routinely employing technologies that are well beyond our level of advancement.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>CARTER: The Asgard are busy rebuilding, which means they haven't been around to do much protecting. The Galarans feel like they need to play catch-up.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>TEAL'C: In all likelihood, that is the reason they are seeking a relationship with the Tau'ri. They are undoubtedly aware of our success against the Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, right now they have no interstellar capability except for the gate itself. They've been working on hyperdrive technology, but without much success.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>LANDRY: And they want to offer this memory device in exchange for our help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, the Emissary was reluctant to get into specifics. I think he wanted to whet our appetite for the technology before we started bargaining.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>LANDRY: Well, it worked. The Joint Chiefs are already salivating over the idea of training jet pilots in a matter of days. We need to set up another meeting.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>CARTER: No need, sir. We've already been invited back for a reception in honor of the scientists who developed the implant technology.</td></tr>
