<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>MYERS: No, not yet. Now, our initial research proved incredibly challenging due to the short lifespans of the R-75 specimens, until we succeeded in dramatically increasing their lifecycles by depriving them of sustenance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>SHEN: They're nocturnal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>MYERS: No. They function during the daylight; they just prefer the darkness. They spend most of their time burrowing underground consuming crops from the roots up. Now R-75 also displays a rather interesting defense mechanism which we're still in the process of studying.</td></tr>
