<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: As Teal'c enters, a soldier falls to the ground, shot. More soldiers are hit and many more are lying on the ground, dead. Teal'c shoots up towards the ramp, where a super soldier is standing. The super soldier is firing from both arms and turns to the other doorway as it opens, shooting a couple of soldiers. O'Neill returns fire and is hit as h enters the Gate room. He falls to the ground. Seeing this Teal'c slightly lowers his weapon then notices that a soldier has dropped another weapon on the ground. Teal'c forward rolls over the dead soldier to pick up the weapon and, from a kneeling position, shoots at the super soldier. A bright blue light is discharged from the weapon and hits the super soldier, who falls to the ramp. Its eyelight fades and dies. Teal'c stands, and as he turns to O'Neill, a bright light envelops the room.</td></tr>
