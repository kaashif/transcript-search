<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The sirens indicating an active Gate are sounding. Daniel comes into the control room and approaches Carter, who is sitting and controlling the MALP. He leans in to look at the screen, which is showing the video feed from the MALP.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>DANIEL: What's going on?</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>CARTER: We're getting MALP telemetry from P3X--289. Atmosphere is completely toxic: sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, if there was a Gate there, then chances are good there was life there at some point.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>CARTER: Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption. Look at this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Video feed from the MALP is on the computer monitor of what appears to be a fuzzy dome in the middle of a white fog. There are rocky outcroppings surrounding the fog and protruding from the foggy area. The MALP's arm can be seen in the top right corner.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>CARTER: We got these images two hour ago, just after the MALP went through. The dome seems to be the only structure that's managed to withstand the corrosive effects of the atmosphere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>DANIEL: How big is it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>CARTER: It's about 2.2 kilometres wide and 500 meters high.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel looks at Carter, somewhat astonished.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>SGT DAVIS: The MALP's giving us a proximity alert. Three meters, and we're picking up a static charge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Video feed from the MALP is shown. The MALP's arm is clearly visible, and beyond it a snowy haze, similar to interference on a TV arm on the monitor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>CARTER: Stop. Extend the arm.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We see the arm extend and it appears to push through a barrier of some kind. There is a bit of a rainbow shimmer as it passes through the barrier. The part of the arm that is through the barrier is no longer visible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>SGT DAVIS: It went right through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, whatever it is, it's not solid.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>CARTER: Move forward.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: On the monitor the map moves forward, through the barrier. After initial interference, the image clears to reveal a green park area, with decidious and evergreen trees, blue sky, and a reddish stone sculpture in the foreground. Carter and Daniel both watch the MALP progress intently. Then the monitor goes black.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>SGT DAVIS: Uh, we've lost contact. The MALP's not responding.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>CARTER: Bring up that last image.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The monitor shows the parkland scene, with sculpture in the foreground, and a large pond a few metres in front.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>DANIEL: How is that possible?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>CARTER: I have no idea.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel looks behind him at the monitors hanging above to check they are showing the same image. Both he and Carter look amazed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: SG1 are on the alien planet. There are several steel girders sticking up from the ground. SG1 are in full hazmat suits.

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>HAMMOND: What about suit integrity?</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>CARTER: According to my readings, the hazmats could withstand about twelve hours of exposure before there was any serious degradation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Shouldn't be a problem, Sir. We can make it to the dome and back inside an hour.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The Gate disengages.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET</td></tr>
<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: SG-1, in red suits, hoods, breathing apparatus, etc. are walking through a very dense fog or smoke. The fog has a slight brown tint to it. There is little visibility, though remains of structures and trees can be seen when they are in close proximity to the team.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>CARTER: Picking up a static charge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>DANIEL: Yeah, I can feel it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They arrive at the forcefield, which is a hazy blue color. SG-1 stop in front of it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>CARTER: The MALP encountered no resistance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Then it disappeared.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>CARTER: It did transmit for a few seconds before we lost the signal, which suggests it got through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill unhooks his P--90 and extends it through the barrier for a few seconds. He pulls it back. Then he walks right through. Once through, he is in a beautiful landscape. He sees what the MALP transmitted just before they lost contact with it. He walks up to the MALP looking behind him. There is no evidence of the barrier, the landscape seems to carry on past it. A few seconds later the rest of SG-1 comes through the barrier, appearing in the park as if from nowhere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>CARTER: I'm reading normal atmosphere. Oxygen, nitrogen... (She turns her scanning device toward Daniel) We're clean too.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>DANIEL: It's like the barrier scrubbed the suits when we passed through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>CARTER: The inside of the barrier seems to be some kind of hologram.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She reaches her hand back in the direction they came from and where she touches the barrier, the landscape seems to blur. Daniel sticks his whole forearm back through the barrier, and it promptly disappears. He pulls it back through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>DANIEL: You can feel the resistance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>CARTER: That combined with the static charge must act as a warning.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She pulls off her hood.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>CARTER: So you don't accidentally step through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill pulls off his hood too and takes a look around. Teal'c takes off his hood as well and does a quick check of the MALP.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>TEAL'C: The MALP appears to be fully operational.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>CARTER: The barrier must block the signal. Sir, this is an amazing piece of technology. Permeable to large solid objects, but won't allow the poisonous atmosphere in. We really need to study this further.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Carter and O'Neill continue to walk away from the MALP with Teal'c and Daniel bringing up the rear. Then they hear a twig snap. O'Neill uses a hand signal to tell the other's to hang back while he investigates. He walks toward a large pine tree, weapon raised.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>O'NEILL: All right, come on out. Let's go.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: A young boy walks out from behind the tree. He pulls down on a branch to look over it at the strangers. O'Neill puts his gun down. Carter smiles.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: SG-1 have taken off their hazmat suits and are walking into a small town. The camera pans out to reveal Nevin up ahead of them wearing one of the suits, carrying the protective hood, and proudly wearing O'Neill's baseball cap. He leads them into the town.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>CARTER: You know, Sir, we probably could have found the town without his help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They follow Nevin into the town square. The streets are cobbled, and the houses are made mostly of red brick. There are lots of flowers hannging in baskets, in tubs on the floor. Several people are sat at tables, having a mid morning drink and chat. They stop and stare at SG-1. Nevin approaches his father. Nevin's father seems to be running a fruit and veg stall. He has a c shaped metallic object on the side of his face near his left temple, as do all the adults in the square.</td></tr>
