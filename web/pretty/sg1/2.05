LOCATION--P3R-636 STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are on a cliff overlooking what appears to be
     Jaffa sending Naquadah through a Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     What's in the fancy box?

  TEAL'C
     It is naquadah. Raw naquadah is highly valued
     among the Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     SG-3 brought back a small amount of the element
     back last year. We could really use some, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Well, maybe there is more.


LOCATION--FOREST

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 come to a cliff edge overlooking a Goa'uld
     ship and a large number of Jaffa.

  O'NEILL
     Whoa.

  ANNOTATION
     A procession of Jaffa come down a path near the
     cliff.

  DANIEL
     Look.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman walks away from the procession and Daniel
     follows.

  O'NEILL
     I wish he'd stop doing that.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 follows the woman to the edge of a cliff.

  O'NEILL
     She's going to jump.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel runs towards the woman and grabs her.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel!

  SHYLA
     Ahh!

  ANNOTATION
     Two Jaffa hear the screams and come running.

  DANIEL
     No, wait. Please.

  JAFFA 1
     Stay away from the princess.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter draw their weapons on the Jaffa
     :.

  DANIEL
     It's okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Two more Jaffa come from behind.

  CARTER
     Colonel?

  SHYLA
     Tell them to lower their weapons. They will kill
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts down his weapon.

LOCATION--PALACE THRONE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A group of Jaffa lead SG-1 in front of Shyla and
     PYRUS.

  O'NEILL
     What were you thinking?

  DANIEL
     I thought she'd be grateful.

  O'NEILL
     She was trying to kill herself!

  JAFFA
     On your knees.

  O'NEILL
     No, actually I've got this cartilage problem,
     little ACL thing...

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa hits him with his staff weapon.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, Yeah, that helps.

  SHYLA
     My Father, Pyrus the God slayer and ruler of this
     planet wishes to know who you are.

  DANIEL
     We're explorers. Peaceful explorers.

  PYRUS
     You attacked my daughter

  DANIEL
     No. Tell him.

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus comes down from his throne and stands in
     front of SG-1.

  PYRUS
     Only one of you is Jaffa.

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus grabs Carter by the head.

  PYRUS
     Who sent you? Where are you from?

  O'NEILL
     We're from a planet called Earth.

  PYRUS
     What Goa'uld rules there?

  O'NEILL
     None

  PYRUS
     Liar. Thieves. You will tell me the truth or you
     will die. Put them in the mines.

  SHYLA
     Father!

  ANNOTATION
     The group of Jaffa grab SG-1 and start to haul
     them out of the room.

  DANIEL
     No wait! We're not thieves. Wait! Please!


LOCATION--MINE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 is using pick axes to break apart rocks.

  CARTER
     Colonel. He isn't a Goa'uld. I don't think these
     are real Jaffa either.

  O'NEILL
     How do you know?

  CARTER
     First clue was his voice.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I noticed that too.

  CARTER
     Sir, I can't really explain it but when he grabbed
     me I just knew. I felt it. Or, to be more
     accurate, I didn't feel it. Sir, I think it has
     something to do with the Goa'uld that invaded me.
     Lately, I...I get this weird feeling when I'm near
     Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Hey, who doesn't?

  CARTER
     No, I can sense the presence of a Goa'uld now. I
     didn't get that feeling when he grabbed me.

  TEAL'C
     I agree with Captain Carter. The ruler here is not
     a Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     Alright, Let's assume you both are right. How does
     that help us?

  CARTER
     I'm not sure

  DANIEL
     Look, I'm really sorry you guys. This is totally
     my fault.

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa walks up to SG-1.

  JAFFA
     You will meet your quota for the day or you will
     not eat.

  O'NEILL
     You know, I've seen an awful lot of union
     violations around here. I should probably speak to
     your supervisor.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa hits O'Neill.

  JAFFA
     You will work.

  O'NEILL
     Hi ho, hi ho, back to work.


LOCATION--MINE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 is still picking apart rocks but looks a
     little more worn down.

  DANIEL
     I can't move anymore.

  ANNOTATION
     A horn sounds and prisoners start to walk through
     in a line.

  JAFFA
     Put down your tools.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa starts to unshackle SG-1.

  JAFFA
     How does your leg feel now?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, much better thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hits the Jaffa with his tool and Teal'c
     throws his ax at another guard. O'Neill picks up a
     discarded Staff weapon and fires.

  O'NEILL
     Let's go. Let's go.

  TEAL'C
     This way.

  O'NEILL
     Let's go Daniel!

  DANIEL
     I'm coming!

  ANNOTATION
     A troop of Jaffa come in and start to fire after
     SG-1. One of the staff weapon blasts hits the
     rocks above Daniel's head, sending them cascading
     on him. O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c turn back to
     help unbury Daniel.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel! God...

  CARTER
     He's alive!

  O'NEILL
     Carter, Teal'c. Take off.

  CARTER
     Sir?

  O'NEILL
     Go!

  ANNOTATION
     As Carter and Teal'c make their way out, another
     group of Jaffa stops in front of them, sealing off
     the exit.


LOCATION--PALACE

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus and Shyla are standing in the throne room.

  PYRUS
     Foolish child. They must have been sent by some
     distant evil God. Then they are here to raid our
     mine. And we can spare none of our naquadah, it
     grows more scares by the day.

  SHYLA
     I know. I will not put our world in jeopardy. When
     you are gone I will have to make these kinds of
     choices all the time. Please, believe in me.

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus turns and leaves. Shyla pushes a button on
     the throne to reveal a sarcophagus, with Daniel
     inside.

  SHYLA
     Do you feel better?

  DANIEL
     What's going on?

  SHYLA
     You tried to escape. You were badly wounded.

  DANIEL
     My friends?

  SHYLA
     They were recaptured. By what name are you called?

  DANIEL
     Daniel Jackson.

  SHYLA
     May I help you out Daniel Jackson?

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla offers her hand to help Daniel out of the
     Sarcophagus.

  DANIEL
     Thank you. Why am I wearing this?

  SHYLA
     I took the liberty of providing you with royal
     robes. You may call me Shyla. In return for saving
     your life, please do not try to escape again. I
     have taken personal responsibility for you.

  DANIEL
     Okay.

  SHYLA
     It would also be rude of you to try and hurt me in
     any way.

  DANIEL
     You do realize it's also kind of rude to kidnap
     people and chain them up in a mine.

  SHYLA
     Please forgive me for not telling my father the
     truth about what happened by the cliff. I...he
     would not understand.

  DANIEL
     Okay. So, you're not Goa'ulds but you're running a
     naquadah mine and you've got yourselves a Goa'uld
     sarcophagus.

  SHYLA
     You know of the sarcophagus?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, I've...I've used one before. Couple of times
     too many if you ask me.

  SHYLA
     Really?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel points to his eyes.

  DANIEL
     My umm..uhh

  SHYLA
     Oh, you want your glass circles. I'm afraid they
     were broken.

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla hands Daniel the broken glasses. He puts
     them on.

  SHYLA
     I just know I've done the right thing. Come! I
     must show you something

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla takes Daniel by the hand and drags him out.


LOCATION--MINE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill are still breaking
     apart rocks, looking quite haggard.

  CARTER
     He needed medical attention.

  O'NEILL
     I know.

  CARTER
     It wasn't your fault sir. We had to take the
     opportunity when we did.

  O'NEILL
     I know that too.

  ANNOTATION
     A young boy offers O'Neill a cup of muddy water.

  O'NEILL
     I've had worse.


LOCATION--FOREST

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla and Daniel are walking along a tree-lined
     path.

  SHYLA
     Isn't this splendid?

  DANIEL
     Why are we here?

  SHYLA
     I know you must've seen much in your travels,
     but...surely you've never seen anything quite so
     beautiful. We call them trees.

  DANIEL
     Ah! Um, so do we.

  SHYLA
     So you've seen them before, on other worlds?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, I have

  SHYLA
     I'm a fool aren't I? I mean surely you've seen
     more incredible things then I can imagine. Please,
     tell me about them.

  DANIEL
     Look, I would really like to tell you everything
     you want to know but...but my friends.

  SHYLA
     My father still believes you and your friends have
     a nefarious purpose here.

  DANIEL
     But you don't.

  SHYLA
     We will convince him that you are decent honest
     people who will bring no harm to our kingdom.

  DANIEL
     I..uh..um, don't suppose we could go talk to your
     father now?

  SHYLA
     He is not well now.

  DANIEL
     I don't...I don't want to spoil this little
     rapport we seem to have going here....

  SHYLA
     That sounds almost romantic.

  DANIEL
     Oh boy, okay, um, here's the thing. I am very
     grateful to you that you saved my life and that
     you want to help me free my friends, but I'm
     sensing that you did it because your, ah...

  SHYLA
     Because you're my destiny.

  DANIEL
     Whuahh....What?

  SHYLA
     Before she died, my mother-in-law used to come out
     here and take long walks at night. You can see
     every star in the sky through the treetops.

  DANIEL
     No, see, about the destiny thing?

  SHYLA
     She used to tell me how a great man would come
     from beyond the sun, just for me.

  DANIEL
     Oh boy.

  SHYLA
     I had come to believe my mother was wrong. That my
     true love would never come. I stood on that cliff
     and I wished one last time. At exactly the right
     moment you were there to save me, Daniel Jackson.
     You cannot deny that is fate.


LOCATION--MINE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill are still hard at work
     breaking apart rocks. Daniel walks in looking
     royal with a Jaffa escort.

  DANIEL
     Hi guys.

  CARTER
     Daniel!

  O'NEILL
     Well. It's surprisingly difficult to kill you,
     isn't it?

  TEAL'C
     We are pleased to see you Daniel Jackson.

  CARTER
     What happened?

  DANIEL
     Uh. Sam was right. Pyrus isn't a Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     What's with the dress?

  DANIEL
     Oh! Ah, they're royal robes. Ah, long story short,
     they have a sarcophagus. Um, the princess put me
     in it and saved my life because she has a, ah, a
     crush on me.

  CARTER
     A crush?

  DANIEL
     Yeah. Actually, she thinks I'm her destiny, the
     whole saving her life thing. I guess she was
     grateful after all.

  O'NEILL
     Well, good job. Now how about getting the goons to
     unlock us and get us the heck out of here?

  DANIEL
     Uh yeah, not yet.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry?

  DANIEL
     Well it's...uh...it's kind of a sensitive
     situation. Pyrus hasn't exactly agreed to let you
     go yet. But I'm working on it. I'm trying to gain
     his trust. Yeah, I know. This is really...

  O'NEILL
     Weird?

  DANIEL
     Look, I just wanted to let you guys know I was
     okay. And I will talk to Pyrus tonight at dinner.

  CARTER
     You get dinner?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, um, some feast in my honor. Or something.

  O'NEILL
     Feast? There is a feast?

  DANIEL
     Just trust me. Okay. I just, I need more time.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns and leaves with his escort.

  O'NEILL
     Glad you're okay!


LOCATION--PALACE DINNING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is seated by himself with food being
     brought to him.

  DANIEL
     Umm, just me?

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus and Shyla walk in. Daniel stands up.

  DANIEL
     Hello, I'm Daniel Jackson.

  PYRUS
     Hmm.

  SHYLA
     My father is pleased that you are so honored to
     dine in the presence of his greatness.

  DANIEL
     Exactly.

  SHYLA
     If you are lucky he will tell you the story of how
     he became the God slayer.

  PYRUS
     I killed Goa'uld who ruled here.

  DANIEL
     And how long ago was that.

  PYRUS
     700 years.

  DANIEL
     700 years? But you're a....of course the
     sarcophagus. But I had no idea it could sustain
     human life so long. Does that mean that you are...

  SHYLA
     No, I'm very young by comparison. I have not
     needed it to extend my life.

  DANIEL
     So the people continue to worship your father
     because he's lived so long.

  SHYLA
     They worship him because he liberated them from
     the evil God.

  DANIEL
     Uh, then why does he keep them working in the
     mines.

  SHYLA
     So the other distant evil Gods won't come.

  DANIEL
     So this, this is a masquerade. You're sending
     Naquadah through the Stargate because that's what
     the Goa'uld used to do. Well no wonder you're so
     paranoid about strangers. You're afraid of being
     found out.

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus gets up, not pleased with the situation.
     Shyla follows after him.

  PYRUS
     I must sleep.

  DANIEL
     Wait, uh...about my friends?

  PYRUS
     Kill them.

  DANIEL
     What? No.

  SHYLA
     Father, you said their punishment for trying to
     escape would be to work in the mines, without rest
     for as long as they live, as an example to the
     other workers.

  PYRUS
     I did?

  SHYLA
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus shrugs his shoulders and walks out of the
     room. Shyla follows him out.


LOCATION--PALACE THRONE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting down when Shyla comes from
     behind him.

  SHYLA
     Do not worry about your friends. I have instructed
     the guards to treat them well.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry, this is unacceptable. I can not be up
     here while they are down there.

  SHYLA
     We will change my father's mind about them.

  DANIEL
     I don't think you're understanding what they mean
     to me.

  SHYLA
     It might just take some time

  DANIEL
     Or maybe you do. The longer it takes to free them,
     the more time we have together. Right?

  SHYLA
     I admit, that is what I would like.

  DANIEL
     Then release my friends. I won't leave. I'll, I'll
     stay and get to know you better. I promise.

  SHYLA
     Then you do feel as I do.

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla kisses Daniel.

  SHYLA
     Should I not have done that?

  DANIEL
     No, it's okay, it's just that...uh

  SHYLA
     Maybe you are still not fully recovered.

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla walks over and presses a button to bring out
     the sarcophagus.

  DANIEL
     I really don't think that is necessary. Uhh...I'm
     okay.

  SHYLA
     But you'll feel so much better

  DANIEL
     Its' uh...please.

  SHYLA
     For me? You will feel better then you have ever
     felt. Trust me and I will trust you. I promise.

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla takes off Daniel glasses and walks him to
     the Sarcophagus. He gets in.

     Chevron Guy is seated at the controls with General
     Hammond behind him.

  CHEVRON GUY

     we are receiving another radio transmission.

  HAMMOND
     Patch it through.

  DANIEL
     (over radio) Mission status remains the same. Need
     more time to situation diplomatically. Next
     transmission in 24 hours. Daniel Jackson out.


LOCATION--MINES

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Carter and O'Neill are still lifting and
     moving around rocks. They aren't looking so good.
     Daniel walks in looking quite well.

  O'NEILL
     What the hell is going on?

  CARTER
     It's been days since we heard from you.

  DANIEL
     Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah. Oh sorry. Um, yeah, I'm
     still working on getting you guys out. Oh in the
     meantime I've discovered something incredible.

  O'NEILL
     You do know we're dying down here don't you?

  DANIEL
     I've taken the opportunity to do a little research
     on the sarcophagus. It's amazing what it does to
     you if use it when you are already healthy.

  CARTER
     Waa...Is that such a good idea?

  DANIEL
     Well, I can't get Shyla to trust me if I don't
     show that I trust her.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, Shyla is it now. First name basis. Shyla.

  DANIEL
     And I've used it before without any side effects.
     And look! No glasses!

  CARTER
     That looks like a side effect to me.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, get us out of here.

  DANIEL
     Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm
     working on it. I just need a little more time. Oh,
     I sent General Hammond another message. Hopefully
     he won't order an all out attack. Look, if we do
     this right we'll have access to all the naquadah
     and the sarcophagus.

  CARTER
     How many times have you used it?

  DANIEL
     I don't know nine or ten. Oh, Sam, everything is
     so clear. I feel like I could do anything.

  O'NEILL
     One thing. You only have to do one thing! And if
     you can't handle that we're gonna break out of
     here without you.

  DANIEL
     She wants me to marry her.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  O'NEILL
     Alright, look....

  DANIEL
     No, you look, Jack!! I have got everything under
     control, okay? God, you never show me any respect!
     Your way didn't work. Now I'm handling it. All you
     guys have to do is hang in there!

     Daniel turns and walks out.

     Daniel is standing when Shyla comes from behind
     him.

  DANIEL
     How is he?

  SHYLA
     The sarcophagus does not make him better the way
     it used to. Soon it will be time for me to become
     queen.

  DANIEL
     Will that be so bad?

  SHYLA
     You do not approve of my father's ways.

  DANIEL
     I can help you make mining much easier and we can
     defend you from the Goa'uld, if you trust me.

  SHYLA
     Even after I used your friends to keep you close
     to me.

  DANIEL
     Oh yeah. I don't think you meant any harm.

  SHYLA
     Then you will stay? Even after they are free?

  DANIEL
     I have never felt better anywhere in my life. I've
     always felt out of place on my planet. I wanted to
     make a difference. There is still so much you
     don't know about me.

  SHYLA
     I know all I need to. We can change things
     here...together.

  O'NEILL
     Water? Hey.

  CARTER
     We don't use the sarcophagus!

  O'NEILL
     What?

  CARTER
     Whoa. Oh that was weird. I was having a vision or
     something. I kept seeing the memory of Jolinar.
     The resistance, the Tok'ra, they don't use the
     sarcophagus. It does bad things to you. It changes
     your mind. It takes something from you. I kept
     hearing...Teal'c what is Kalach?

  TEAL'C
     It is Goa'uld. It means one's soul.

  CARTER
     Sir, we have to stop Daniel.

     O'Neill is on his knees in front of Daniel.

  O'NEILL
     (coughing) We're losing the battle down there you
     know. Carter has started having Goa'uld
     flashbacks. Says if you keep using the
     sarcophagus, you're going dark side on us...if you
     haven't already.

  DANIEL
     Well don't worry a bit. We're getting out of here
     tomorrow.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DANIEL
     I agreed to marry her.

  O'NEILL
     You did?

  DANIEL
     But...

     Daniel jumps down and picks O'Neill off the floor.

  DANIEL
     I said I had to go home and straighten a few

     Love has blinded you.

  SHYLA
     They are good people. We have done a grave
     injustice to them.

  PYRUS
     I pray that you are right.

  SHYLA
     I must let Daniel go. The choice to return must be
     his. But, he will come back to me. He can't live
     without me anymore.

  ANNOTATION
     Pyrus gets into the sarcophagus with a lot of help
     from Shyla.


LOCATION--IN FRONT OF THE STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 stands with Shyla about to dial home.

  SHYLA
     He was once the greatest of men. But, he can rule
     no longer. He lives only to see me married. I
     extend the sincerest apologizes for the hardship
     done to you and offer the friendship of our world.

  O'NEILL
     Well, thanks.

  SHYLA
     Please know that from now on you will always be
     welcome here and will be treated with the utmost
     respect.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, O'Neill turn towards the gate. Carter
     begins to dial. Daniel walks to Shyla and kisses
     her.

  DANIEL
     I'll be back. Soon.


LOCATION--GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     General Hammond is waiting at the bottom of the
     ramp for SG-1.

  O'NEILL
     We had a nice time, Sir. Carter picked up some
     Naquada. Teal'c made some new friends as usual.
     Daniel got engaged. And, um, I'm gonna hit the
     showers.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting on a bed with Carter standing
     next to him.

  DANIEL
     This is stupid.

  CARTER
     Doctor Fraiser says your systems are all out of
     whack.

  DANIEL
     Well, I feel fine. God I need to get out of here
     or I'm gonna go nuts.


LOCATION--LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is testing the Naquadah. Daniel is pacing
     around the floor.

  CARTER
     You're going to wear a hole in the floor.

  DANIEL
     I can't get her out of my head, Sam. I think I've
     made a big mistake.

  CARTER
     You're not serious.

  DANIEL
     I am.

  CARTER
     You have a wife.

  DANIEL
     Had. Had a wife. Come on, seriously. How long am I
     supposed to wait? Even if I find Sha're one day,
     what are the chances she'll ever be the same
     again?

  CARTER
     Look, your endorphin level was through the roof
     when we came back. And now you're coming down off
     of it. The effects of the sarcophagus are like a
     narcotic Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, that makes you smarter, stronger, you live
     for hundreds of years, feel great. What the hell
     is so wrong with it?

  CARTER
     I think it's partly what makes the Goa'uld as bad
     as they are.

  DANIEL
     How?

  CARTER
     Who knows. It's Goa'uld technology Daniel. Maybe
     it's healing affects alter your brain chemistry.
     Increased adrenaline, the hormones that make you
     more aggressive and irrational. Pyrus probably
     used to be a decent man. Look at yourself. It's
     like you need a fix. You've only used it a few
     times and already it's changed you.

  DANIEL
     We can't just leave it there. We have to study it.

  CARTER
     We can't go back either.

  DANIEL
     Well I'm going.

  CARTER
     She used us to get you addicted.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel slams down his fist in a rage and knocks
     over some bottles.

  DANIEL
     You've never really known what love is have you?

  CARTER
     See, the Daniel I know would never have said that.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel knocks over some more stuff and walks out
     of the room.


LOCATION--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     General Hammond is seated talking to Carter and
     O'Neill.

  HAMMOND
     What are you saying Captain?

  CARTER
     Sir, I think he needs to be confined. He is
     clearly addicted to the affects.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks in and sets some papers on General
     Hammond's desk.

  HAMMOND
     What's this?

  DANIEL
     It's my resignation.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, please.

  DANIEL
     General, I respectfully request permission to go
     through the gate to

  P3R-636


  O'NEILL
     Request denied!

  DANIEL
     I wasn't asking you!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel starts to collapse.

  CARTER
     Daniel?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter catches Daniel as he hits the floor.
     General Hammond stands up.

  HAMMOND
     Doctor Jackson?

  CARTER
     He's unconscious. lGeneral Hammond picks up the
     phone

  HAMMOND
     This is General Hammond. Code red medical
     emergency in my office.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is lying down in bed with the rest of SG-1
     looking over as Doctor Fraiser checks him out.

  FRAISER
     I gave him a sedative. His test results are all
     over the place. Liver function, Kidney function,
     endorphins, electrolytes, levels indicated muscle
     deterioration.

  O'NEILL
     Alright alright, whatever. What's going on with
     him?

  FRAISER
     I have no idea. The most I can do is try to treat
     the symptoms. But the bottom line is that he seems
     to be going through some massive physical
     withdrawal.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel wakes up and starts to try to get up.

  DANIEL
     I have to go back! You're killing me!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel starts to pull out his IV. Teal'c runs over
     to stop him when Daniel pushes him away.

  DANIEL
     Stop killing me!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill jumps on top of Daniel.

  FRAISER
     Hold him down!

  ANNOTATION
     Doctor Fraiser gives Daniel an injection to calm
     him.

  DANIEL
     (in pain) Ahh...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel struggles then passes out.


LOCATION--LAB

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and General Hammond are standing around
     Doctor Fraiser trying to figure out what is wrong
     with Daniel.

  FRAISER
     It's like all of his cells have lost the ability
     to function properly and it's getting worse by the
     hour.

  HAMMOND
     There is nothing you can do?

  FRAISER
     I'm trying.

  TEAL'C
     The sarcophagus with keep Daniel Jackson alive.

  CARTER
     No, we can't let him go back. That thing will just
     screw him up permanently and we'll lose him
     anyway. The memories that Jolinar left in my mind
     told me that the sarcophagus will take away
     everything that Daniel is.

  O'NEILL
     What choice do we have?

  CARTER
     We wait it out. Just a little longer.


LOCATION--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is now strapped to the bed and writhing
     about. DOCTOR FRAISER is watching him on a screen
     when O'Neill walks in.

  FRAISER
     Hey.

  O'NEILL
     How's he doing?

  FRAISER
     Well I can't say for sure but I think maybe the
     worst is over. His blood work in improving, body
     temperature is coming down, pulse is normal, BP
     120/80.

  O'NEILL
     So we made the right call.

  FRAISER
     His cellular function is starting to take back
     control. The next few hours should tell. Time for
     another dose of sedative.

  ANNOTATION
     Doctor Fraiser walks out of the room.


LOCATION--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is still strapped down to the bed. A guard
     opens the door so Doctor Fraiser can give him his
     sedative. O'Neill is watching from the Lab via he
     security camera.

  FRAISER
     Okay, Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Doctor Fraiser leans over to shine a light in
     Daniel's eye. Daniel grabs her and flips her over
     the bed.

  FRAISER
     Ahh!

  ANNOTATION
     The guard outside hears the scream and opens the
     door.

  GUARD
     Stand down!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel punches him, repeatedly.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill notices on the monitors that Daniel is
     missing from the bed and runs down the corridor to
     the room to find the Doctor Fraiser getting off
     the floor.

  FRAISER
     I'm okay. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hits the alarm button and chases after
     Daniel. Daniel runs into a storage room and shuts
     the door. O'Neill follows. He turns on the light
     and starts to look for Daniel. Daniel shoots the
     light out above O'Neill's head.

  O'NEILL
     Geez! Daniel! Are you trying to kill me?

  DANIEL
     You're trying to kill me.

  O'NEILL
     There'll be guards here in thirty seconds.

  DANIEL
     I'm going back.

  O'NEILL
     You don't have to! Fraiser says you're getting
     better.

  DANIEL
     You're lying!

  O'NEILL
     Why would I do that?!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel rushes him, and they fight. Daniel turns
     out to be really strong with that sarcophagus drug
     in him. Finally Daniel gets the gun and aims it at
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel! God...What are you going to do, Daniel? Do
     you want to kill me? Oh God, look at you. I know
     what this is. I know what it's like. You can get
     through it...

  DANIEL
     No...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel breaks down crying, and O'Neill pulls him
     into a hug.


LOCATION--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter are standing talking to
     General Hammond.

  CARTER
     Probe's data indicates P3H--826 is a viable next
     mission for SG-1 sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks in.

  DANIEL
     I have another suggestion. I think we should go
     back to P3R-636. And, before you say anything,
     just hear me out. There are thousands of innocent
     human beings there who we could free from slavery.

  TEAL'C
     Shyla can not free her world without putting her
     people at great risk.

  DANIEL
     Well, we have to offer her alternatives, new ways
     to mine the naquadah. I mean, we don't even know
     that Goa'uld will notice if the shipments stop.

  CARTER
     Our preliminary tests do indicate potentially
     countless military and scientific applications for
     the raw ore. Might be a compelling reason to try,
     sir.

  HAMMOND
     Try what? Last time you were captured and enslaved
     in that mine.

  DANIEL
     Look, you want access to the mine but you don't
     want to send troops in. I'm offering you a shot at
     a diplomatic solution. Please, Jack, we need to
     take the chance.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Daniel and then turns to General
     Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     We can back him up sir. I'd like Daniel back on
     the team.


LOCATION--THRONE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla is leaning against the sarcophagus, crying.
     Daniel walks in behind her.

  SHYLA
     I did not believe you would ever return.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry...about your father...about everything.

  SHYLA
     The sarcophagus could not help him anymore.

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla stands up and faces Daniel.

  SHYLA
     You never did love me did you?

  DANIEL
     I wouldn't be here if I didn't care.

  SHYLA
     I don't deserve to live after what I've done to
     you.

  DANIEL
     Yes, you do. Your people need you. You may still
     be able to lead them without turning into what
     your father became.

  SHYLA
     How?

  DANIEL
     You can't use this anymore. It's going to be bad.
     Trust me. But you don't have to do this alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Shyla walks to the end of the sarcophagus and
     picks up a staff weapon. Daniel joins her. She
     aims and fires, destroying the sarcophagus in a
     blue electrical storm. Daniel takes the staff
     weapon and hugs her.
