  ANNOTATION
     A ha'tak flies through space, heading for a huge
     mothership.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP MEETING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al's female representative addresses three
     System Lords, including Yu.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     The System Lords are no longer. You have become a
     meaningless coalition that cannot resist the power
     of my master, Lord Ba'al.

  ANNOTATION
     Oshu, Yu's First Prime bends to listen to Yu
     whisper to him.

  OSHU
     Your master has no honour. The System Lords have
     not weakened in their resolve.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     The Jaffa are weak willed and fallible. Is it any
     wonder they've begun to doubt their faith in the
     Gods. So many Goa'uld have fallen.

  OSHU
     Ba'al was wise to send a representative.

  YU
     I would have killed him with my own hands!

  ANNOTATION
     Yu, obviously angry, raises his fists.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     Despite your ill will, Lord Ba'al wishes to extend
     a most generous offer. In exchange for your
     surrender, Ba'al will allow you to keep your
     armies and continue to administer your territories
     under his authority. You will be permitted to
     live, so long as you bow before him as a Supreme
     Commander of the entire Goa'uld domain.

  ANNOTATION
     Yu is obviously furious.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     Refusal to accept the terms of this offer will
     result in the resumption of hostilities and
     ultimately, your death.

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa walks up to Ba'al's spokeswoman and stands
     respectfully at her side. She gestures for him to
     speak to her, which he does quietly.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     (to Jaffa) Bring her.

  YU
     What is the meaning of this?

  REPRESENTATIVE
     I should ask you the same thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters the chamber. Two Kull Warriors
     follow her, each with a hand on her shoulder.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     Major Samantha Carter.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     Actually, I'm a Colonel now.

  ANNOTATION
     The two super soldiers push Carter to her knees.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     Her cargo ship was intercepted by my sentries when
     it violated the proximity zone around this
     station.

  ANNOTATION
     Yu rises, staring at Carter.

  REPRESENTATIVE
     I am well aware of your past relationship with
     SG-1 and the Tau'ri. Would you have me believe
     that her sudden appearance here is nothing more
     than mere coincidence?

  ANNOTATION
     Yu walks over to Carter.

  YU
     What are you doing here?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, obviously Replicator Carter, stabs Yu. The
     knife goes through his body. Replicator Carter
     advances on Ba'al's representative, the bloodied
     knife part of her metal arm.

  ANNOTATION
     A mothership hovers over a planet.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac is at the controls. SG-1 walk into the
     room.

  TEAL'C
     They are late.

  DANIEL
     Or they're not coming.

  TEAL'C
     Were that the case Rak'nor would have sent word.

  BRA'TAC
     If he were able to do so.

  CARTER
     Maybe we should reconsider the mission.

  TEAL'C
     This is not an SGC mission. Reconsidering is not
     an option.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at Carter and sighs.

  DANIEL
     Look, I know the timing of these first few
     surprise attacks is crucial, but...

  CARTER
     And we're just here as observers but, right now,
     I'm observing the fact that if you take on one of
     Amateratsu's motherships without proper backup,
     you could get yourself killed.

  DANIEL
     Us observers, too.

  BRA'TAC
     Many such attacks have been co-ordinated
     simultaneously across the galaxy. Each one
     designed to create a strategic weakness in the
     forces of the System Lords.

  DANIEL
     And if even one fails, I know...

  TEAL'C
     The rebel Jaffa have gone to great lengths to
     acquire the security codes currently being used by
     the System Lords. If all goes according to plan
     they will believe we are allies and lower the
     shields.

  DANIEL
     If all goes according to plan.

  TEAL'C
     Once the shields are lowered, the Jaffa contingent
     aboard this vessel, should be sufficient to
     overwhelm any initial resistance we may encounter.

  BRA'TAC
     We have allies within the ranks of Amateratsu's
     Jaffa, who will also help facilitate our attacks.
     Once the others witness the death of their false
     God, they will realise the truth and join our
     ranks.

  CARTER
     Isn't the fact that we haven't heard from Rak'nor
     kind of a bad sign?

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac glances at Teal'c. A sensor chimes and a
     screen shows a space map.

  DANIEL
     What is it?

  BRA'TAC
     Ship's sensors have detected a vessel closing in
     on our position. Hat'ak class.

  DANIEL
     Rak'nor?

  TEAL'C
     Unlikely. Rak'nor would have hailed long before
     his approach.

  CARTER
     Then it has to be Amateratsu. Shouldn't we get out
     of here?

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac turns to Teal'c, who looks uncomfortable.

  DANIEL
     Teal'c, the odds are not in our favour.

  TEAL'C
     They never are, Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel shrugs in agreement.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A ha'tak closes on the mothership.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP

  BRA'TAC
     I am hailing them and transmitting the security
     codes.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shudders as it is fired upon.

  BRA'TAC
     They fired on us. Shield strength is down 60%.

  TEAL'C
     How is that possible?

  CARTER
     What the hell did they hit us with?

  TEAL'C
     Returning fire.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves to the weapons console and fires.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The weapons fire seems to have had no effect.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP

  TEAL'C
     Our weapons are ineffective.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shudders as it is hit again.

  BRA'TAC
     We have lost shields.

  CARTER
     Now can we get outta here?

  BRA'TAC
     Navigational controls are not responding. We must
     evacuate.

  DANIEL
     Glider bay?

  TEAL'C
     We can use the rings to transport to the planet
     below and escape through the Stargate.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave and make their way through the ship.
     Suddenly, Teal'c stops, hand raised to stop the
     others.

  CARTER
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Doors in the corridor ahead open and insect
     Replicators swarm towards them.

  DANIEL
     That's not good.

  TEAL'C
     This way.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leads them off down another corridor. The
     Replicators follow and Carter and Daniel turn and
     firing at them. The Replicators zoom in on Daniel,
     who is suddenly beamed away.

  CARTER
     Daniel!

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter follows Teal'c and Bra'tac, moving away
     from the Replicators.


LOCATION--SGC COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob walks down the ramp as O'Neill enters, arms
     outstretched in greeting.

  O'NEILL
     Jacob!

  JACOB
     Jack, we've got a problem. We need to talk.

  O'NEILL
     Hi! Hello. How are ya? Long time, no see. What's
     doing? What's up? Hey buddy?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pats Jacob on the shoulder.

  JACOB
     I'm sorry, Jack, it's good to see you again.
     Congratulations on your promotion.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands.

  O'NEILL
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill smiles slightly.

  JACOB
     You deserve it.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, well...What's up?

  JACOB
     The Replicators. They've launched an all-out
     attack on the Goa'uld. If the Goa'uld can't find a
     way to stop them the Replicators will easily
     overrun our galaxy in a matter of weeks.

  O'NEILL
     Why didn't you say so?

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob walks out of the gateroom, O'Neill following
     close behind.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry! You said we had a problem, not a big
     galactic emergency!


LOCATION--SGC LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is sitting in front of a monitor, O'Neill
     standing beside him. A technician hands Jacob some
     equipment. O'Neill is also holding a device.

  JACOB
     Our operatives have spent the past several years
     taking as many Goa'uld ships as possible, in an
     effort to track their movements. Today, we have
     beacons on more than a hundred motherships
     transmitting their location via subspace, to an
     encoded Tok'ra network.

  O'NEILL
     And this?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures at the device he is holding.

  JACOB
     It's a receiver that will allow me to tap into the
     subspace network. We can keep tabs on Ba'al's
     fleet, see how their battle with the Replicators
     is faring. We can also get up-to-the minute Tok'ra
     intelligence reports from our agents in the field.

  O'NEILL
     You know, we could have used something like this a
     long time ago.

  JACOB
     The High Council never thought they could trust
     you with it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hands the receiver to Jacob, who places it
     on the console.

  O'NEILL
     What changed their mind?

  JACOB
     Nothing. They don't know I took it.

  O'NEILL
     Ah!

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob prepares the receiver.

  JACOB
     My relationship with the council is still a little
     strained.

  O'NEILL
     It's not going to get any better if you keep
     stealing stuff.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob turns to look at O'Neill, who places his
     hand on his shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     No complaints, I'll take anything I can get.
     Weapons, receivers, silverware.

  ANNOTATION
     The receiver is activated and a large screen shows
     a space map containing tens of dots.

  JACOB
     Each dot represents a Goa'uld ship.

  O'NEILL
     That's a lot of dots.

  JACOB
     That's just one small quadrant of the galaxy.
     Watch.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob types, and the screen changes to show the
     dots up close. Suddenly, one of the dots pulses
     and the frequency label against it changes to
     "Lost Signal" as the dot disappears. Another dot
     begins to pulse and also disappears off the
     screen.

  O'NEILL
     What just happened?

  JACOB
     The beacon stopped transmitting their signals.
     Likely meaning, those ships were either destroyed
     or taken over by the Replicators.

  ANNOTATION
     Another mothership disappears from the screen.

  JACOB
     Battles like the one you just witnessed are taking
     place across the galaxy. Several Goa'uld
     territories are now entirely in Replicator hands.

  ANNOTATION
     Another mothership disappears.

  JACOB
     As I said, given the progress of these battles,
     the Goa'uld will be wiped out in a matter of
     weeks.

  ANNOTATION
     Yet another mothership disappears from the screen.

  O'NEILL
     You know, I have to admit, I have some mixed
     feelings about this.

  JACOB
     Well, we all want to see the Goa'uld stranglehold
     on the galaxy broken, but not if they're just
     going to be replaced by something worse.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm sounds.

  HARRIMAN
     (over PA System) Unscheduled Offworld Activation.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob and O'Neill leave the lab.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Teal'c and Bra'tac come through the
     Stargate as Jacob and O'Neill enter the gateroom.

  CARTER
     Dad.

  JACOB
     Hey, kiddo.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob kisses Carter on the cheek.

  O'NEILL
     So, what the heck happened? Didn't you guys have a
     ship?

  ANNOTATION
     The gate deactivates, Carter and Bra'tac turning
     to look at it. They glance at each other before
     turning back to face O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     And by the way...where's Daniel?

  BRA'TAC
     He was beamed away before our very eyes.

  TEAL'C
     By Replicators.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sighs.

  JACOB
     Just Daniel?

  CARTER
     There's only one reason I can think of. My
     duplicate. She knows the greatest threat the
     Replicators have ever known is the disruptor
     technology that you built using Ancient knowledge.

  O'NEILL
     So? She's immune to that now.

  CARTER
     Yes, but Replicators always seek out the most
     advanced technology. She may be worried that
     there's other Ancient technology out there that
     could be a threat to her and the rest of the
     Replicators.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson had access to the knowledge of the
     Ancients when he was ascended.

  JACOB
     I thought he didn't retain those memories?

  CARTER
     We don't know that for sure. Daniel has remembered
     certain things from when he was ascended. She may
     think that everything she needs to know about the
     Ancients is buried in his subconscious. If it is,
     she'll find it.

  O'NEILL
     Oy!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sighs again.


LOCATION--SGC COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c, Bra'tac, Jacob and Carter are
     sitting around the table.

  JACOB
     The Tok'ra have operatives in Ba'al's inner
     circle, including one of his high ranking
     lieutenants. According to the latest intelligence,
     the ranks of the Jaffa rebellion are re-pledging
     their loyalty to the Goa'uld, by the thousands.

  CARTER
     But the Goa'uld are losing the war.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, you'd think that'd make them look weaker.

  BRA'TAC
     The Jaffa have never seen the likes of such
     creatures. Many could see these Replicators as a
     plague, an evil punishment brought upon all for
     daring to stray in their beliefs and betray their
     Gods.

  TEAL'C
     This situation has dealt the Jaffa rebellion a
     serious blow. Even if we were to somehow defeat
     the Replicators the Goa'uld would undoubtedly take
     credit, thereby solidifying Jaffa loyalty, as well
     as their belief in the Goa'uld as Gods.

  O'NEILL
     I think the key phrase in there was, "somehow
     defeat the Replicators"?

  CARTER
     We haven't had much luck, sir. The inert
     Replicator cells left behind by my duplicate
     haven't given us any clues as to how to fight the
     immunity she's developed. As far as I know, Thor
     hasn't made much progress in modifying the
     disruptor technology, either.

  O'NEILL
     Well, let him know what's going on, and don't be
     afraid to remind him that we've saved his cute,
     little grey bum, several times.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets up and leaves for his office.


LOCATION--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac stares into a candle.

  BRA'TAC
     Years of effort, all but undone in a matter of
     days. It will now be almost impossible to turn so
     many of our brothers back to our cause.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to face Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps. Yet there may be a way.

  BRA'TAC
     Even if we can, I wonder, will it make a
     difference? These machines are unlike anything
     I've seen.

  TEAL'C
     We must proceed in the belief that Colonel Carter
     and Thor will devise a means to destroy the
     Replicators.

  BRA'TAC
     How then can we prevent the Goa'uld from taking
     credit, and solidifying their position as Gods in
     the eyes of all Jaffa?

  TEAL'C
     We must act now, before this conflict is resolved.
     Win back the hearts and minds of those who waver,
     before they are lost to us. We must, once and for
     all, destroy the Goa'uld's image as Gods, forever.

  BRA'TAC
     How?

  TEAL'C
     By capturing the temple at Dakara.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac looks shocked.

  TEAL'C
     Everything we have fought for hangs in the
     balance.

  BRA'TAC
     Yes. But Dakara?

  TEAL'C
     Capture it, and never again will a Jaffa worship a
     false God.


LOCATION--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter appears in the doorway and enters the
     office.

  CARTER
     Sir. I'm sorry to bother you, but...

  O'NEILL
     I'm only going to say this once, Carter. What
     happened to Daniel was not your fault.

  CARTER
     She knows he may hold key Ancient knowledge
     because of me. She's out there because of me. I
     basically gave her the means to counter the only
     effective weapon we have against her.

  O'NEILL
     I also gave you permission to work with her. It's
     not going to change anything.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sighs quietly and looks down.

  O'NEILL
     Unless you're suggesting we use that time machine
     to go back and fix it.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at him.

  CARTER
     No, sir. We all agreed we would never do that. For
     all we know it could just make things worse.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman knocks on the door

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, we're receiving a message from Thor. He said
     he's ready to transport...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is suddenly beamed out, interrupting
     Harriman.

  O'NEILL
     You were saying?

  HARRIMAN
     Never mind.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman shakes his head and leaves.

     Carter is beamed into the ship's control centre.

  THOR
     Hello again, Samantha Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter raises her hand and waves.

  CARTER
     Hi, Thor.

  THOR
     I have already transported your research and the
     remains of the human-form Replicator to this lab.
     We may continue our work from here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks over to Thor at the control module.

  CARTER
     Any progress on your end?

  THOR
     I have yet to isolate the cipher the human form
     Replicator introduced to render the disruptor
     weapon ineffective.

  CARTER
     Well, given the situation I think it's time to
     take more drastic steps.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is standing next to a podium holding the
     separated parts of Replicator Carter's arm.

  THOR
     You are suggesting we attempt to trigger a
     subspace connection between the remains of the arm
     and the rest of the Replicator, so that we may
     search for the cipher among their communications
     data?

  CARTER
     Too wild and crazy?

  THOR
     In order to do that, we must reactivate the cells.

  CARTER
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Thor begins reactivating the Replicator cells.


LOCATION--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is siting behind his desk, Bra'tac and
     Teal'c standing in front of it.

  O'NEILL
     What makes this place so special?

  TEAL'C
     The temple at Dakara is sacred to all Jaffa.

  BRA'TAC
     It is rich in historical significance. Legend
     tells, it is the place where Anubis rose from the
     dead.

  TEAL'C
     It is also the site of the first Prim'ta ritual.

  BRA'TAC
     It is that rite of passage that has bonded us in
     servitude, ever since. For thousands of years the
     Jaffa have viewed Dakara as the holiest of sites,
     the very cradle of our existence. It is the place
     where the Goa'uld first gave Jaffa their strength
     and longevity.

  O'NEILL
     And you really think this place is going to make a
     difference?

  BRA'TAC
     Seizing control of the temple there would prove
     beyond a shadow of a doubt the Goa'uld do not
     possess the power of the Gods.

  TEAL'C
     Even the most stubborn Jaffa would have to
     question his loyalty to the Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     There has to be a catch or you guys would have
     done this a long time ago.

  BRA'TAC
     Dakara is deep within Ba'al's territory, and under
     normal circumstances it is heavily guarded.
     However, with Ba'al's forces deployed throughout
     the galaxy battling the Replicators, the temple is
     more vulnerable now than it has ever been.

  TEAL'C
     Still, our success depends on the element of
     surprise and the use of the entire rebel fleet.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes his head.

  BRA'TAC
     Listen to me, O'Neill. This war must be fought on
     two fronts. We will re-ignite the uprising and
     conquer our oppressors, while you find the means
     to stop these Replicators. Let us each fight the
     enemy we know best.

  ANNOTATION
     The Replicator ship is flying through space.


LOCATION--REPLICATOR SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is in an empty room, with walls made of
     Replicator pieces. Replicator Carter appears
     through a wall.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     Hello, Daniel.

  DANIEL
     What the hell do you want?

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     You have information that I need.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks towards him.

  DANIEL
     Okay, what do you want to know?

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     I'm afraid it's not that simple.

  DANIEL
     Oh no, it is that simple.

  ANNOTATION
     As she nears him, he backs away until he reaches a
     wall.

  DANIEL
     If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not do the
     hand on the head thing. Honestly, I'll tell you
     whatever you want to know.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     Honesty is not the problem.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly, bands come out of the wall, holding him
     in place by his arms and legs.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     Unfortunately, to get what I need, we're going to
     have to dig a little deeper.

  ANNOTATION
     More blocks extend from the wall around both sides
     of Daniel's head.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     Shall we begin?


LOCATION--PLANET NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     A camp has been established at the side of a hill.


LOCATION--TENT

  ANNOTATION
     A fire is burning, around which stand a number of
     Jaffa, Bra'tac and Teal'c.

  ARON
     What you are proposing is madness. Dakara cannot
     be taken.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks towards him, but is stopped by
     Bra'tac's fist to his chest.

  BRA'TAC
     Tolok, you have not spoken.

  TOLOK
     Aron's right. We would be sacrificing countless
     men and ships on a fruitless mission.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac turns to Teal'c, who looks disappointed.

  TOLOK
     We should be concentrating on the greater threat,
     the Replicators, before they destroy us all.

  TEAL'C
     Jaffa, hear me. I have engaged the Replicators in
     battle many times. Believe me when I say they
     cannot be defeated by conventional means.

  ARON
     You have faced them in the past and won.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. Yet never in such numbers. Those of you
     who choose to engage the Replicators in battle
     will not survive.

  BRA'TAC
     Teal'c is right. We must fight only those battles
     we know we can win.

  TOLOK
     Yet you propose an equally impossible task.

  BRA'TAC
     With Ba'al otherwise occupied, now is the time to
     strike.

  TOLOK
     No free Jaffa has ever set foot in the temple and
     lived.

  BRA'TAC
     Well, that is precisely why we must go there. If
     we succeed, many will join our cause.

  ARON
     If we succeed.

  TEAL'C
     Were the circumstances different, I would feel the
     same as you, brother. But the situation has
     changed. We must act now or our children will know
     no future, let alone a taste of freedom.

  TOLOK
     Teal'c, I believe there is wisdom in these words.
     However, you are aware that if we fail, it would
     effectively mean the end of the rebellion. Are you
     prepared to risk our entire cause on this one
     action?

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac turns to look at Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed I am.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa look at each other.

  BRA'TAC
     So. What say you?

  TOLOK
     I say we take Dakara.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles slightly, and Aron nods briefly in
     agreement.

  ARON
     So be it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Bra'tac turn to each other, satisfied.

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows another Goa'uld mothership being
     destroyed.

  JACOB
     Five more regions belonging to Ba'al have fallen
     in the past 24 hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is again sitting at the console, with
     O'Neill standing next to him.

  O'NEILL
     He's not putting up much of a fight, is he?

  JACOB
     He's making a typical Goa'uld mistake. He's
     defending territory at the expense of resources.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob sighs.

  JACOB
     We can send him a message through the undercover
     Tok'ra in his midst. We could suggest a change in
     strategy.

  O'NEILL
     Like what?

  JACOB
     Typically, the Replicators are patient and slow
     moving when not being engaged. If Ba'al stops
     aggressively fighting them and pulls back, it may
     give Sam more time to come up with a solution.

  O'NEILL
     Forget that.

  JACOB
     Look, there goes another one.

  ANNOTATION
     Another ship disappears from the screen. Jacob
     stands to face O'Neill.

  JACOB
     Jack, he's thinking like a System Lord defending
     himself against another Goa'uld. He doesn't know
     what he's dealing with.

  O'NEILL
     And if he retreats, where do you think he's going
     to fall back to?

  JACOB
     You're worried about Teal'c and the rebel Jaffa.

  O'NEILL
     They're counting on Ba'al's fleet being too busy
     to even care about anything else.

  JACOB
     The Jaffa rebellion has already failed. We can't
     risk the fate of the galaxy on one long-shot
     chance to revive it.

  O'NEILL
     Is that Jacob talking? Or is that Selmak?

  JACOB
     Jack, I'm sorry. But the more ships Ba'al sends
     out to fight, the faster the Replicators
     assimilate them into their own armada. Their
     numbers are growing exponentially. If we don't do
     something about it, by the time we do come up with
     a weapon to use against them, it may be to late.

  ANNOTATION

  HARRIMAN

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman shakes his head as a hologram image of
     Ba'al appears at the base of the ramp in the

  ANNOTATION

  O'NEILL
     (to SFs) Stand down boys.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stands at the base of the ramp, facing
     Ba'al.

  O'NEILL
     Ba'al, buddy. We were just talking about you. All
     good.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill smirks at Ba'al.

  BA'AL
     By now you are aware of the Replicator threat in
     our galaxy, and that my fleet has engaged them in
     battle.

  O'NEILL
     There's been a little chit...and chat, around the
     water cooler. How's that going?

  BA'AL
     We're holding them at bay for the moment. However,
     they are a more formidable force than I first
     anticipated.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, pesky little buggers, aren't they?

  BA'AL
     I am aware that the Asgard have previously fought
     the Replicators, effectively.

  O'NEILL
     More or less. I don't like to toot my own horn,
     but...

  BA'AL
     I am aware that you assisted the Asgard.

  O'NEILL
     Yes?

  BA'AL
     I wish to know what means you possess to fight the
     scourge.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry, we must have had a bad connection there
     for a second. It almost sounded like you were
     asking me for help.

  BA'AL
     The Replicators are a threat to everyone,
     including the countless humans who populate worlds
     throughout this galaxy. Now, I propose that we
     work together, to defeat our common enemy.

  O'NEILL
     My, this is an occasion. You know that bitter
     taste in your throat? It's kind of wrapped around
     your uvula? That's what's left of your pride.

  BA'AL
     Perhaps you could curb your amusement for a
     moment.

  JACOB
     If we're going to work together, the first thing
     we should discuss is strategy. Now, your attempts
     at meeting the Replicators head on are only going
     to result...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill places his hand on Jacob's chest to stop
     him.

  O'NEILL
     Jacob, Jacob, Jacob.

  JACOB
     What?

  O'NEILL
     I got it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turn to face Ba'al, a slight smirk on his
     face.

  O'NEILL
     I've got a better idea. Instead of helping you,
     why don't we sit back and watch you get your ass
     kicked. That way, you'll be dead and we'll be
     glad.

  BA'AL
     You cannot be serious.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, I can. I just choose not to, some of the
     time.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob sighs quietly.

  BA'AL
     With your insults you're dooming not just your
     world but all of humanity.

  O'NEILL
     I think big.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al image disappears. Jacob, hands on hips,
     walks round to face O'Neill.

  JACOB
     (angry) What the hell was that?

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry, Jacob, but I'm just not quite ready to
     sacrifice Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks away. Jacob nods his head slightly.

  CARTER
     What if they receive...instructions?

  THOR
     It is a risk we will have to take. I will only

  OMA
     Daniel, it is good to see you again.

  DANIEL
     I don't understand. Last thing I remember...

  OMA
     You are still on the ship. The human-form
     Replicator is attempting to probe your mind as we
     speak.

  DANIEL
     So why are you here?

  OMA
     Because when she is done she will destroy you. And

     Anubis.

  BA'AL
     I've received word from the battle. The bulk of
     the fleet continues to engage the Replicators, as
     you have ordered. However...

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al pauses. Anubis is sitting on a throne, his
     hands blistered.

  BA'AL
     I believe it would be wise to pull our forces
     back. If we stop confronting the enemy on so wide
     a front, it may slow their advance, and allow us a
     chance to mount a proper defence.

  ANUBIS
     You doubt my power?

  BA'AL
     Of course not. But your fleet is falling into
     their hands rapidly. Not even the Kull Warriors...

LOCATION--SGC COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is speaking to O'Neill via videolink.

  CARTER
     It took several hundred micro-second long
     connections, and hours to go through each
     subsequent burst of data, but eventually we
     managed to isolate the cipher that makes the
     Replicators immune to the disruptor, and we've
     adjusted it accordingly.

  JACOB
     (to O'Neill) The weapon works again.

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Good job!

  CARTER
     It was an incredibly risky thing to do, sir. As it
     stands, we still don't know if we were detected.
     And, of course, the altered disruptor still needs
     to be tested under battle conditions.

  O'NEILL
     Got a plan?

  CARTER
     Thor was able to ascertain the various positions
     of the fleet now controlled by the Replicators.
     We're going to engage a few isolated ships.

  JACOB
     Be careful, Sam.

  O'NEILL

  DANIEL
     So, you're here to offer me the opportunity to
     ascend again.

  OMA
     If that is what you wish.

  DANIEL
     I wish? What are my options?

  OMA
     Personally, I would choose eternal enlightenment
     rather than the alternative.

  DANIEL
     If it were only that simple.

  OMA
     I admit, the decision is not as easy as it
     appears. The last time, for you, the experience
     was challenging at the best of times.

  DANIEL
     Unfortunately, I don't have any memories of the
     last time I was ascended. How can I make an
     informed decision if I don't remember what it was
     like?

  OMA
     Daniel, I did not take your memories from you.

  DANIEL
     You think I haven't tried to remember? Tell me
     how.

  OMA
     I can't.

  DANIEL
     Then tell me what I need to know.

  OMA
     If you are seeking an absolute truth you will not
     find it. Only truth that applies to you.

  DANIEL
     That is so extremely unhelpful.

  OMA
     When the time comes, you will know.

  DANIEL
     What if Replicator Carter finds what it is she's
     looking for?

  OMA
     There is that possibility.

  DANIEL
     You have to stop her.

  OMA
     I can't.

  DANIEL
     Why not? Offer me ascension now.

  OMA
     You're not dead yet. All I can do is prepare you,
     help you to find your path to enlightenment when
     that time comes, if that is what you decide you
     want.

  DANIEL
     There's a way to defeat the Replicators hidden
     somewhere within my memories, isn't there?

  OMA
     You need only to open your mind to it.

     If she really has as much power as you think she
     does, why doesn't she help you? She merely stands
     by and does nothing.

  DANIEL
     Do you mean, while you destroy entire
     civilizations?

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     That's a matter of perspective. You call it
     destruction. We call it creation.

  DANIEL
     You're not really trying to justify your actions,
     are you?

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     No. I have no need for you to understand us.

  DANIEL
     Why the elaborate ruse? I mean, you probed my mind
     at will, I obviously can't stop you.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     You could have resisted. I needed you to open up
     to the possibility of remembering the knowledge in
     your subconscious. It made it much easier for me
     to find what I was looking for.

  DANIEL
     And what did you find?

  ANNOTATION
     She turns to the outside, where the sand is being
     re-formed to the shape of the temple at Dakara.

  DANIEL
     Pretty. What is it?

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     The ruins of an Ancient monument on a planet now
     called Dakara. Within it is the one weapon in this
     galaxy capable of destroying me.

  ANNOTATION
     She moves her hand and the image in the sand blows
     away. She turns back to face Daniel.

  REPLICATOR CARTER
     Thanks to you, it will soon be no more.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stares, frowning, at Replicator Carter.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm is sounding. Harriman checks his watch as
     he and Siler stand, facing Ba'al's hologram.

  HARRIMAN
     I'm sure he'll be here any second now.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al is obviously impatient.

  HARRIMAN
     So, um...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters.

  O'NEILL
     I am so sorry! I was just finishing up a lovely
     brunch.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill slaps his stomach.

  BA'AL
     Impudence.

  O'NEILL
     No, tuna. So, I hear your fleet is retreating from
     the Replicators.

  BA'AL
     How could you know that?

  O'NEILL
     I have my sources.

  BA'AL
     My fleet is on its way to recapture Dakara and
     destroy the Jaffa who have dishonoured their true
     God.

  O'NEILL
     Will you stop with the true God crap? I mean
     seriously, what difference will it make? You're
     just delaying the inevitable.

  BA'AL
     The Replicators are a formidable enemy, but I've
     recently learned of a weapon hidden on Dakara
     capable of destroying them.

  O'NEILL
     Really? And you're telling me this, why?

  BA'AL
     Because you must destroy it, before my fleet
     arrives to claim it.

  O'NEILL
     Alright, you got me. I haven't the slightest idea
     what you're talking about.

  BA'AL
     The weapon on Dakara was built by the Ancients. It
     is not only capable of destroying the Replicators
     but all life in the galaxy.

  O'NEILL
     And, your own sweet self included.

  BA'AL
     Yes.

  O'NEILL
     So why would you use it?

  BA'AL
     I would not, but there is one who would. One who
     can survive such pervasive devastation.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill closes his eyes briefly and shakes his
     head.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, please don't tell me.

  BA'AL
     Anubis.

  O'NEILL
     I asked you not to tell me.
