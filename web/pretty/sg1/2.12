<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>GARSHAW: That is correct. None of you have volunteered to be a host to one of us who is dying!

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>CARTER: That's before I understood it better. I-If I wasn't fighting her and I knew what it meant for Jolinar to be a Tok'ra, it might have been...I don't know, enlightening.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>CARTER: No, sir. More like letting one share it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>CARTER: General Hammond, please, I know my father would want to do this. He would have the opportunity to serve as the liaison between ourselves and possibly the most important ally we will ever have.</td></tr>
