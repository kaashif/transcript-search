The Tok'ra Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--VORASH--TOK'RA HIGH COUNCILCHAMBERS

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and SG-3 including Colonel Makepeace are
     under heavy Tok'ra guard, as Grand Council Garshaw
     of Belote enters.

  GARSHAW
     You wish to see me?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill casually strolls over to meet her.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Garshaw, could you at least tell us why you've
     turned down our request for an alliance?

  GARSHAW
     We have decided that your limited resources do not
     offer us enough of a reward to risk the high
     security breach that your knowledge of us will
     cause.

  O'NEILL
     That's it?

  DANIEL
     Well, at least allow us some time to try to find
     some technology, some skill, something that you
     don't have.

  GARSHAW
     I'm sorry, I don't believe it exists.

  O'NEILL
     So we are prisoners. You're lookin' like Goa'uld
     to me.

  GARSHAW
     We are doing this for your protection as well as
     ours. Knowledge of our whereabouts makes you and
     your world a priority target for the Goa'uld
     System Lords.

  O'NEILL
     We're already a priority target.

  TEAL'C
     They previously despatched two motherships to
     destroy us.

  CARTER
     There's another reason, isn't there? Something
     else bothers you about us.

  GARSHAW
     That is correct. None of you have volunteered to
     be a host to one of us who is dying! If you're so
     disgusted with the very thought of blending, how
     can we be associated with one another? I mean, it
     is obvious that you have distaste for our very
     being.

  DANIEL
     No, it is--it is simply a lack of understanding.
     We have no hatred for you at all.

  GARSHAW
     Then be a host to Selmak.

  DANIEL
     Well, I wish I could say I was okay with that,
     but...

  GARSHAW
     The very thought sickens you. There is nothing
     more to be said. There will be no alliance. You
     will remain here until we say otherwise.

  ANNOTATION
     She storms off, and the camera pans to a close-up
     of a worried Major Carter.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     In the room with the pools, SG-1 and SG-3 are
     being guarded by Tok'ra with staff weapons. Carter
     rises up from her seat and strolls over to Colonel
     Makepeace who is bent over one of the small pools
     of water.

  CARTER
     Colonel Makepeace? Did anyone tell you how far
     along my father is?

  MAKEPEACE
     No, I was only told to get you back as soon as
     possible.

  CARTER
     He doesn't even know why I'm not there for him. He
     thinks I'm off somewhere working on some damn
     satellite dish or something.

  O'NEILL
     We're going to get you back there, Carter. The
     good news is, there's eight of us now.

  DANIEL
     That's good news?

  O'NEILL
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at Daniel pointedly.

  O'NEILL
     More manpower.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter resumes taking her seat dejectedly.

  TEAL'C
     Is this another one of your strange jokes,
     O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     Ah, no.

  TEAL'C
     It would be impossible. There is only one way out,
     via the rings. We would then have to elude
     hundreds of Tok'ra.

  CARTER
     I, for one, don't want to hurt any of them.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill rises from his seat on the edge of one of
     the pools.

  O'NEILL
     Look, I'm not too thrilled about hurting anyone
     either. But keep in mind these people want to make
     you a host, and as I recall you said that whole
     'Jolinar Goa'uld in the head' deal was one of the
     worst things that ever happened to you!

  CARTER
     That's before I understood it better. I-If I
     wasn't fighting her and I knew what it meant for
     Jolinar to be a Tok'ra, it might have been...I
     don't know, enlightening.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill cocks his head at her disbelievingly.
     Carter rises again.

  CARTER
     I need to see Garshaw!

  ANNOTATION
     Two Tok'ra guards leave the room. Daniel rises
     from his seat and walks over to Carter, alarmed.

  DANIEL
     What?

  CARTER
     What is the one thing that they need the most?

  DANIEL
     Well, hosts, which we can't give them.

  GARSHAW
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Garshaw enters with Martouf.

  CARTER
     You said that the symbiote can cure most problems
     in a human.

  GARSHAW
     Yes.

  CARTER
     Does that include cancer?

  MARTOUF
     (confused) What is cancer?

  DANIEL
     It's a disease in humans where the cells grow out
     of control, you get tumours...

  GARSHAW
     Oh yes, it's a common ailment amongst your
     species. We cure it all the time, it's no problem.

  CARTER
     Colonel, I think we should at least try to offer
     it to my Dad?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Daniel, and O'Neill look at Carter.
     O'Neill pauses, then looks at Garshaw.

  O'NEILL
     We might have a host for you.

  GARSHAW
     You have a host for Selmak?

  CARTER
     Yes. My father. He's got cancer and if Selmak can
     save his life, I think he'd be willing to try it.

  O'NEILL
     But you have to let us go back.

  GARSHAW
     I will let two of you go. But the rest will remain
     to ensure that you will return.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates, and Carter and O'Neill
     exit the wormhole. General Hammond enters the Gate
     room to greet them, an SF following.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill, where's Colonel Makepeace, SG-3,
     they were supposed to extract only Captain Carter.

  O'NEILL
     General, we need to talk.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, and Hammond are seated at the
     Briefing Room table.

  HAMMOND
     Captain Carter, I am truly sorry about your
     father, but I have to question the wisdom of what
     you're suggesting here. From what I've seen, this
     won't exactly be saving his life. It'll be more
     like giving his body to a Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     No, sir. More like letting one share it.

  ANNOTATION
     Frustrated, Carter rises and walks to the window
     overlooking the Stargate.

  HAMMOND
     Jacob knows a lot about Earth, about the US
     Military. This would be like handing that
     information over to the Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     To the Tok'ra.

  HAMMOND
     You sure there's a difference?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, yes, sir, there's a difference, believe me. I
     won't even pretend to understand what the
     difference is, but there is one. One minute you're
     talking to a Goa'uld, the next minute you're
     talking to a regular guy...person.

  CARTER
     Host.

  O'NEILL
     A host.

  HAMMOND
     How do you know it isn't just a trick? We've seen
     the Goa'uld speak as humans before.

  O'NEILL
     Well, General, if these were your everyday run of
     the mill greasy-assed Goa'uld, they would have
     made us their hosts already.

  HAMMOND
     They were holding you prisoner, Colonel. Still are
     holding SG-3 and the rest of your team!

  CARTER
     Only temporarily, sir. And they thought it was to
     protect us as much as them.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond pauses and looks from Carter to O'Neill.
     O'Neill looks at Carter, then to Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I didn't buy that one myself, sir.

  CARTER
     General Hammond, please, I know my father would
     want to do this. He would have the opportunity to
     serve as the liaison between ourselves and
     possibly the most important ally we will ever
     have.


LOCATION--THE DUNES ON VORASH

  ANNOTATION
     A lone Tok'ra runs across the desert.


LOCATION--VORASH TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     In the Council Chamber where both SG teams under
     guard, Teal'c rises from his seat and approaches a
     seated Garshaw and bows reverently.

  TEAL'C
     I would like to take this opportunity to express
     my admiration for your cause. It is both
     honourable and brave.

  GARSHAW
     Thank you, Jaffa. I must say I feel the same about
     you. To break from Apophis and then turn to fight
     him shows great conviction of character.

  MARTOUF
     Master Garshaw, we just received word from our
     scout in the Shoran'ka quadrant. The Goa'uld
     System Lords have been told where we are. They
     have dispatched two motherships.

  GARSHAW
     When will they arrive?

  MARTOUF
     Within the day, perhaps hours.

  GARSHAW
     Start the evacuation!

  ANNOTATION
     Garshaw and Martouf leave as the rest of the
     Tok'ra scatter, leaving Makepeace, Teal'c, Daniel,
     and SG-3 to wonder what's happening.


LOCATION--EARTH--HOSPITAL ENTRANCE


LOCATION--JACOB'S HOSPITAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     General Hammond enters Jacob's room with Carter in
     tow. Jacob is gazing out the window. He has an IV
     and nasal canula for oxygen.

  HAMMOND
     Clear the room, people.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob turns to view his visitors as the hospital
     staff leave the room.

  JACOB
     (sighs) I told you not to recall her.

  CARTER
     Happy to see you too, Dad.

  HAMMOND
     You wanted me to tell you what Captain Carter
     does, so I thought maybe she could tell you
     herself.

  JACOB
     Yeah? What happened to the classification?

  HAMMOND
     It's still classified. But you just got clearance.

  JACOB
     (sighs) Why?

  CARTER
     Well, believe it or not, we need your help, Dad.

  JACOB
     (Laughs and coughs) What? The Pentagon wants me to
     deliver a message to God when I get up there?

  HAMMOND
     Not exactly.

  JACOB
     Well, I don't plan to see the other guy.

  CARTER
     Dad, have you ever heard of the Stargate program?

  JACOB
     No, is that one of your satellites?

  CARTER
     I don't work with satellites, Dad, that was just a
     cover.

  JACOB
     No kidding. I never would have guessed. So tell
     me, what do you do that's so great you don't want
     me to get you into the astronaut program?

  CARTER
     Well, this is going to be a lot for you to take in
     at once.

  JACOB
     Stop beating around the bush. What do you do?

  CARTER
     I travel to other planets. Much farther away than
     any astronaut goes.

  JACOB
     So you're not going to tell me the truth.

  HAMMOND
     She is telling you the truth, Jacob.

  JACOB
     She goes to other planets. What, like in
     simulations?

  HAMMOND
     No. In reality.

  CARTER
     We discovered a piece of alien technology. It can
     send us to thousands of planets all over the
     galaxy.

  JACOB
     You're not kidding, are you.

  CARTER
     No.

  JACOB
     Holy Hannah!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles at Hammond.

  JACOB
     So what do you want me to do?

  CARTER
     Well, we'd like you to travel to one of these
     planets with us.

  JACOB
     Why? So I can die there?

  CARTER
     No. Actually, I'm hoping what we want you to do
     will cure your cancer.

  JACOB
     They have a cure there? What's the catch?

  HAMMOND
     It's a doozy, Jacob, I won't lie to you on that.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The klaxons sounds as blast door open to reveal
     Carter, O'Neill and Jacob. Both are assisting her
     father into the Gate room as the Stargate is
     dialing.

  TECHNICIAN
     (Over P.A. System) Chevron 6 locked.

  JACOB
     So this is the alien thing you found?

  CARTER
     Yup.

  JACOB
     And it sends you to other planets?

  TECHNICIAN
     Chevron 7 locked.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate kawooshes and Jacob gasps in
     amazement.

  O'NEILL
     How about them apples, huh?

  JACOB
     Incredible!

  CARTER
     Let's go, Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter guides her father along to the ramp and the
     three approach the event horizon.

  JACOB
     (staring) Does it-- what does it feel like?

  CARTER
     You've handled worse, Dad.

  O'NEILL
     (Smiling) It's a piece of cake, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob eyes O'Neill warily, and they walk through
     the Stargate.


LOCATION--STARGATE ON VORASH

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, and Jacob emerge from the
     Stargate. Jacob looks back at the Gate, while
     O'Neill puts his sunglasses on.

  JACOB
     You do that a lot?

  CARTER
     Yeah, once or twice a week.

  JACOB
     It beats the hell out of a shuttle on the back of
     a rocket.

  O'NEILL
     Goes a lot further, too. You know, I was kind of
     expecting a little greeting party or something.

  JACOB
     You sure this is another planet? It looks like
     Earth.

  CARTER
     Yeah, we figure the Stargate system was built
     specifically to transport humans or something
     close to humans in physiology. So it seems to go
     mostly to places where the environment supports
     human life.

  ANNOTATION
     The three begin to walk.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     People are rushing around, moving equipment. SG-3
     are helping to move equipment, where it is
     transported out using the Goa'uld Ring
     Transporter. O'Neill, Carter, and Jacob are
     transported into the midst of the excitement. In
     the chaos, O'Neill spots his colleague.

  O'NEILL
     Makepeace?

  MAKEPEACE
     (Seeing O'Neill) All right airman, carry on.

  O'NEILL
     What the heck's going on?

  MAKEPEACE
     We're free.

  O'NEILL
     Then why are you still here?

  MAKEPEACE
     Well, we want to be allies, right, so we're
     lending a hand with the evacuation.

  ANNOTATION
     Two of SG-3 are carrying a large crate between
     them, followed by Daniel and Teal'c who are also
     carrying a large crate.

  O'NEILL
     What evacuation?

  DANIEL
     (Setting down the crate) Come on, I'll explain as
     we go.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill go on ahead as Carter and Jacob
     stop before Teal'c.

  CARTER
     Dad, this is Teal'c. Teal'c, this my father.

  TEAL'C
     It is an honor.

  ANNOTATION
     The two men shake hands Jaffa-style--gripping each
     other's arms--then Carter guides her somewhat
     overwhelmed father through the tunnel.


LOCATION--ANOTHER AREA OF THE TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel approach the area where their
     packs and weapons are stored.

  DANIEL
     This is where they've been stacking our stuff.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill goes over to grab some equipment. Carter,
     Jacob, and Teal'c arrived momentarily. They all
     stand and gape at the tunnel before them as it is
     closing in on itself.

  TEAL'C
     Chel nak.

  DANIEL
     Direct translation: "very cool".

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill finishes gathering their belongings.

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) Okay, you want to tell me what's going
     on now?

  DANIEL
     They're evacuating, so we're free to go.

  O'NEILL
     Why?

  TEAL'C
     The System Lords are ready to attack. The Goa'uld
     motherships are on the way.

  O'NEILL
     Oh.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Two Goa'uld motherships are traveling at
     hyperspeed.


LOCATION--THE SURFACE OF VORASH

  ANNOTATION
     A Tok'ra lookout is poised atop a large dune.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Jacob are in the same collapsing tunnel.

  O'NEILL
     All right, where do we find Garshaw?

  TEAL'C
     We last saw her in the council chamber.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill starts to move out.

  O'NEILL
     All right boys, let's go. (To Carter) Call if you
     need me.

  CARTER
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leads Jacob off in a different direction as
     Jacob looks back at the collapsing structure.


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob and Carter enter the room. Martouf is there.
     And two woman are fanning Selmak and administering
     to the dying Tok'ra. Martouf looks up and sees
     them.

  LANTESH
     You have returned.

  CARTER
     Yes. This is my father, Jacob Carter.

  LANTESH
     Honoured.

  MARTOUF
     I am Martouf. You have a very special daughter.

  JACOB
     Why does he talk like that?

  CARTER
     He's a Tok'ra, Dad. I told you about them.

  JACOB
     Oh, so these are the aliens you were telling me
     about?

  CARTER
     Well, I don't know if I'd call them aliens, sort
     of half alien I guess. I mean, the outside is
     human, and the inside is shared between a human
     and a symbiote. Martouf is actually two
     different...souls, I guess, sharing the same body.

  JACOB
     And that's what you want me to become.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks upon the elderly woman on the bed and
     raises his eyebrows.

  JACOB
     You got to be kidding me.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Teal'c, and O'Neill are walking down one
     of the tunnels.

  O'NEILL
     So fill me in. How'd the System Lords find them?

  TEAL'C
     That is unknown.

  O'NEILL
     Are we talking about a spy here, or what?

  DANIEL
     Well, if that's the case, moving to another
     planet's not going to do them much good.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you know those little pellet-ball things?

  TEAL'C
     The long-range visual communications device?

  O'NEILL
     Right. How small do they make those?

  TEAL'C
     I have seen them small enough to fit in the palm
     of your hand.


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  JACOB
     I'm not sure I can do this, Sam.

  LANTESH
     No one wishes to pressure you in any way, sir. The
     decision is yours, but before deciding, might I
     suggest that you-- you take a moment to get to
     know the symbiote that wishes to blend with you.

  JACOB
     (Indicating Saroosh) This is her?

  CARTER
     Actually, you can only see the host. The
     symbiote's inside her.

  JACOB
     Inside her.

  CARTER
     Talk to her, Dad. Get to know her.

  ANNOTATION
     Selmak opens her eyes and looks at Jacob.

  SELMAK
     If you agree to the blending, we could be together
     for a very long time.

  ANNOTATION
     She coughs.

  JACOB
     You don't look so good.

  SELMAK
     You are no vision of beauty yourself, sir!

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob laughs, but it deteriorates into a cough.
     Selmak/Saroosh and Jacob both cough!

  JACOB
     It's all right, sorry.

  SAROOSH
     I'm the one to whom you should be talking.

  JACOB
     You are the one I'm talking to. Why, why did your
     voice change like that?

  CARTER
     That's the host talking now.

  SAROOSH
     I am Saroosh. I am in the position to help you
     most.

  JACOB
     How's that?

  SAROOSH
     I will die, Selmak will live on, you will take my
     place as host.

  JACOB
     Um, I don't understand.

  SAROOSH
     Selmak is a wonderful Tok'ra. She is selfless and
     caring, she is good company. She has a wonderful
     sense of humour.

  CARTER
     Well that's good Dad, you can sit around for hours
     cracking yourself up.

  JACOB
     (Not laughing) That's funny.

  SAROOSH
     She's not far wrong. I've had almost two hundred
     years of laughter thanks to Selmak. I'm biased, of
     course, but I believe that Selmak is among the
     best educated of the Tok'ra. You will probably be
     overwhelmed by the knowledge and wisdom you will
     gain upon blending.

  JACOB
     So, I get all of this thing's, uh, what did you
     call in their head?

  CARTER
     Symbiote.

  JACOB
     Yeah. I get all its memories and stuff?

  CARTER
     Yeah, Dad, something like that.

  SAROOSH
     Then I won't deceive you, sir. We have some pretty
     awful things buried in our memory.

  JACOB
     Such as?

  SAROOSH
     Memories of countless Goa'uld atrocities, the loss
     of the host before me, and you will feel the
     mourning for my loss.

  JACOB
     Will you excuse me ma'am?

  ANNOTATION
     He rushes off out of the chamber and throws up.
     Carter follows him.

  JACOB
     I'm sorry. I didn't want my future, um, I guess
     you could call her soul-mate, to see me like this.

  CARTER
     Dad, you don't have to do this.

  JACOB
     Yes I do. My only other choice is death, and
     that's not acceptable. Look, don't worry, it's not
     just hearing all that stuff that made me lose my
     stomach, it's the chemo. And the trip through that
     damn Stargate thing.

  CARTER
     It's okay. This is a lot of weird information for
     anyone to take in at once. Trust me, I know.

  JACOB
     Okay.


LOCATION--TOK'RA COUNCIL CHAMBERS

  ANNOTATION
     Garshaw and another Tok'ra are packing away
     equipment. Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill enter.

  O'NEILL
     Garshaw?

  GARSHAW
     What can I do for you?

  O'NEILL
     I think you might have a spy in your ranks.

  GARSHAW
     Nonsense, the Tok'ra are loyal for life!

  TEAL'C
     How then were you located by the System Lords?

  GARSHAW
     How did you find us?

  DANIEL
     Well, we did have a spy in our ranks.

  TEAL'C
     Jolinar of Malk-shur, through Captain Carter.

  GARSHAW
     I suppose you know the name of the spy?

  O'NEILL
     I've got a pretty good idea.

  GARSHAW
     Who?

  O'NEILL
     Well, I don't want to point fingers, but I'd keep
     my eye on Cordesh.

  GARSHAW
     Cordesh? Why do you say that?

  O'NEILL
     You folks make a habit of walking around with
     those little teleball dealie...what are they?

  TEAL'C
     He speaks of a long-range visual communications
     device.

  GARSHAW
     We don't have those, we have no use for them. The
     system is not secure.

  O'NEILL
     Well, your buddy Cordesh has one.

  GARSHAW
     (Becomes enraged) Tok'ra kree! Tal shak Cordesh,
     kree!

  ANNOTATION
     Garshaw and the Tok'ra run off in search of
     Cordesh.

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel and Teal'c.) Better stay here.

  ANNOTATION
     He runs off with the Tok'ra, as Daniel and Teal'c
     look at each other.

  DANIEL
     (shrugs) We'll stay here.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     Garshaw, O'Neill and two Tok'ra guards arrive at
     one of the collapsing tunnels. Garshaw stops, and
     the guards take aim as they've found their quarry.

  GARSHAW
     Cordesh!

  ANNOTATION
     Cordesh turns. He is standing near the collapsing
     tunnel.

  GARSHAW
     You must come with me and face questioning.

  CORDESH
     I'm not what I appear to be. Cordesh is no longer.
     I couldn't stop him.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill mutely tries to signal with his hands the
     impending collapse of the tunnel.

  CORDESH
     I'm as guilty as he was!

  GARSHAW
     You must leave the tunnel and explain yourself,
     Cordesh.

  CORDESH
     I don't deserve to remain among the Tok'ra.

  ANNOTATION
     He screams as the collapsing tunnel swallows him
     up. Garshaw is horrified.

  O'NEILL
     (wincing) Ouch.


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter follows her father back into the room.
     Jacob walks to Selmak's bed.

  JACOB
     Okay...what do I have to do?

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a seat, exhausted.

  MARTOUF
     First, Selmak would like to interview you.

  JACOB
     Huh?

  SELMAK
     If I am to spend the next hundred or more years
     with you as my host, do you not think I have the
     right to decide if I even like you?

  JACOB
     (laughs) What's not to like? Just ask my daughter,
     I'm a teddy bear.

  CARTER
     Oh yeah, real...teddy bear.

  SELMAK
     How do you feel about the Goa'uld?

  JACOB
     Well, you're the first one I've met.

  SELMAK
     I am not a Goa'uld.

  JACOB
     Ah, trick question?

  CARTER
     Remember, Dad, I tried to explain the difference.

  JACOB
     Right, right, I-I apologise. I guess I've never
     met a Goa'uld before. Although from what Sam and
     her people tell me, I don't think I like them
     much.

  ANNOTATION
     Selmak nods to Martouf and he leads Carter away,
     allowing them privacy. The two continue to watch,
     however, from the doorway.

  SELMAK
     Tell me, sir, are you a good man?

  JACOB
     (laughs) You're kidding, right?

  SELMAK
     No, we'll be spending the rest of our lives
     together.

  JACOB
     Look, forgive me for being blunt, but you're
     dying, right?

  SELMAK
     My host is, yes.

  JACOB
     And you'll die with her unless you and I,
     uh...what did you call it? Blend, right?

  SELMAK
     Yes.

  JACOB
     And I'll die too, unless we do this. So my point
     is, good man, bad man, what difference does it
     make? We don't have a choice. And I don't mind
     telling you the whole idea scares the hell outta
     me. So can we just get it over with?

  SELMAK
     I have decided I like you.

  JACOB
     Super.

  SELMAK
     But I must be sure that you understand there will
     be no turning back. I cannot blend with you, cure
     your disease, then leave. To do so, would probably
     kill us both.

  JACOB
     I understand. Let me ask you something, though.
     After we do this, will I still be able to talk to
     my daughter?

  SELMAK
     The way Saroosh talked to you, yes. But you and
     your daughter must understand the blending may not
     work at all. I am very weak, and the damage to
     your body may be too extensive.

  JACOB
     In other words, we might die anyway.

  SELMAK
     Yes.

  JACOB
     Then can you give me five with my kid?

  SELMAK
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob walks over to Carter.

  LANTESH
     (To Jacob.) You must hurry, we don't have a lot of
     time.

  ANNOTATION
     Lantesh returns to Selmak's side.

  JACOB
     Listen Sam, I was never good at this stuff.

  CARTER
     Dad, you don't have to say anything.

  JACOB
     You got to know one thing--how proud I am of you.
     I'm not good at saying these things enough.

  CARTER
     (Her voice shaking) I think you just said it
     pretty well.

  JACOB
     Even when I thought you were this whiz satellite
     geek, I was proud. That's all I want to say.

  CARTER
     Please, Dad.

  JACOB
     (Biting back emotion) Hey, I know, I'm a pain in
     the ass. (laughs) Maybe this Tok'ra lady will, uh,
     sand off some of the rough edges. It might be a
     good thing, right?

  CARTER
     Could be. The longer we wait the less the chance
     is.

  JACOB
     (To Lantesh and Selmak.) Okay, what do I do?


LOCATION--TOK'RA COUNCIL CHAMBERS

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c, Garshaw, and Daniel gather around
     one of the pools.

  GARSHAW
     Cordesh must be guilty of something or he'd not
     have allowed himself to be buried.

  O'NEILL
     What, he had a choice?

  GARSHAW
     I must thank you. You may have saved the Tok'ra a
     great many losses.

  O'NEILL
     You're welcome.

  GARSHAW
     But, you still have nothing to offer us.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DANIEL
     Well, actually, I think we do.

  TEAL'C
     Do we?

  DANIEL
     Well, the one thing you need the most we can
     provide. Hosts.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Well, think about it. I mean, if it works for
     Sam's father, then there must be other people in
     similar situations.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill ponders the idea.

  O'NEILL
     (To Garshaw.) It's worth exploring.

  GARSHAW
     It is.

  ANNOTATION
     All four leave the Council Chambers.


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob and Saroosh lie facing each other on the
     bed. Carter is holding Jacob's hand.

  MARTOUF
     We do not enter our hosts through the back of the
     neck. This just leaves a scar that many of us find
     unsettling.

  CARTER
     So why don't the Goa'uld do it this way too?

  MARTOUF
     They don't wish to remember the horror of their
     host's face whenever they see their own reflection
     in the mirror. You must step away, Captain Carter.

  JACOB
     Goodbye, kid.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter strokes his head.

  CARTER
     See you soon, Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks away while Selmak gazes upon Jacob.
     Jacob turns his attention back to Selmak.

  JACOB
     (Clears his throat) Now what?

  SELMAK
     Kiss me.

  JACOB
     You're kidding, right?

  SELMAK
     No, I'm not.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob leans towards Saroosh, his mouth open. The
     symbiote appears out of Saroosh's mouth and then
     enters Jacob's. Jacob reacts uncomfortably for a
     few moments following the blending. When he can,
     he looks over at Saroosh, who finally dies.

  SELMAK
     (Now blended with Jacob) Goodbye, dear friend.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob loses consciousness. Carter and Martouf go
     to his side. Carter takes Jacob's pulse while
     Martouf covers Saroosh's face.

  CARTER
     He's alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Martouf opens one of Jacob's eyes.

  CARTER
     Is he okay?

  MARTOUF
     He's very sick. And Selmak is weak. She may not
     have the strength to heal him.

  CARTER
     Well, is there anything we can do to help?

  MARTOUF
     Nothing. Only time will tell.

  ANNOTATION
     A Tok'ra guard dashes into the room.

  TOK'RA
     Our scouts have spotted the Goa'uld ships dropping
     from hyperspace.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks up to the guard.

  TOK'RA
     They will start attacking from the air and through
     the Gate within hours. Garshaw orders that we must
     destroy the complex.

  CARTER
     We need time! (To Martouf) Can we move him?

  MARTOUF
     If we do so, if will kill them.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter rushes back to her father's side. She
     strokes his head.


LOCATION--ONE OF THE TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     As more Tok'ra continue to mill about and move
     equipment, SG-1 and Garshaw walk through the
     tunnels. O'Neill sees a female Tok'ra carrying a
     small silver box. She notices him looking at her
     and she continues to move on.

  O'NEILL
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to run off and he chases her, grabbing
     onto her arm. The woman glares at O'Neill as
     Garshaw approaches hurriedly.

  YOSUF
     What are you doing?

  O'NEILL
     I'll apologise if I'm wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes the box from the woman, and opens it. It
     contains a small Goa'uld long-range communications
     device. The woman continues to glare at O'Neill as
     Daniel, Teal'c and Tok'ra guards approach.

  O'NEILL
     (Showing the orb to Garshaw) Cordesh had one of
     these.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands the device to Garshaw who takes it.

  YOSUF
     So there are two spies.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks upon the Tok'ra woman.

  O'NEILL
     Or not. Cordesh said he wasn't who he appeared to
     be.

  TEAL'C
     Goa'uld can jump hosts to hide, much as Jolinar of
     Malk-shur.

  YOSUF
     Cordesh?

  FEMALE TOKRA
     The plague that is the Tok'ra will soon be wiped
     out!

  GARSHAW
     I am sickened to think I once called you my
     friend, Cordesh, but I want you to know--the
     System Lords will fall, but you won't be alive to
     see it. (To other Tok'ra guard.) Attempt to remove
     Cordesh from the host without harming her. Then
     put this traitor in one of the vanishing tunnels.

  ANNOTATION
     The Tok'ra guards take the woman away. Garshaw
     turns to O'Neill and kisses him on both of his
     cheeks.

  GARSHAW
     I believe I shall be proud to call you friend.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks away, as O'Neill stands there stupefied
     and clears his throat.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Death gliders are seen departing the two Goa'uld
     motherships now orbiting Vorash. The gliders zoom
     towards the planet.


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is clinging to Jacob's hand as he lay
     unconscious on the bed. Martouf looks on.

  YOSUF
     Martouf!

  ANNOTATION
     He looks up as Yosuf/Garshaw and SG-1 enter
     Selmak's room hurriedly. Carter turns to face
     them.

  YOSUF
     All tunnels but this one and the escape tunnel
     have vanished. All the other Tok'ra have gone to
     the new homeworld. We must go now!

  CARTER
     But what about my father?

  YOSUF
     When and if he awakens, Selmak knows where we'll
     be. He can follow.

  DANIEL
     But the Goa'uld are coming, they'll capture him.

  YOSUF
     If he's captured, he will die before he will
     reveal our whereabouts.

  CARTER
     Well, then take him with you!

  O'NEILL
     Or we'll take him with us.

  MARTOUF
     I'm afraid that to transport him now, he will die.
     He needs to remain stationary until Selmak has
     completed her repairs.

  CARTER
     We can't just leave him here!

  MARTOUF
     I will remain with him. If I can get him out, I
     will. If not, I will allow the vanishing tunnels
     to consume us before the Goa'uld get here.

  GARSHAW
     I cannot allow you to die in this way. We must
     leave now!

  CARTER
     I'll stay.

  GARSHAW
     You are even more vulnerable since you contain the
     memories of Jolinar. I cannot allow you to stay.
     We must go now.

  O'NEILL
     She's right, Captain. We have to go.

  CARTER
     With respect, no, sir. I am not leaving him here.

  MARTOUF
     Captain Carter and I will both remain. I will
     assure that we will not be taken by the Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     Please, Colonel. I need to be here.

  O'NEILL
     Right. Daniel? Teal'c? Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Teal'c and O'Neill exit the room with
     Garshaw, leaving Carter and Martouf alone with
     Jacob/Selmak.


LOCATION--THE SURFACE OF VORASH

  ANNOTATION
     They run for the Stargate.

  YOSUF
     We may not have much time before the Goa'uld come
     through the Gate blocking our way.

  DANIEL
     We can take you to our planet and then send you to
     your new home from there.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, start dialing home.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c's attention is drawn skyward.

  DANIEL
     (Pointing backwards) Well, shouldn't we wait for
     Carter?

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill!

  ANNOTATION
     About nine death gliders are seen approaching from
     the sky.

  O'NEILL
     Dial!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel rushes to the DHD and starts dialing. The
     gliders close and begin firing. The Stargate
     activates and they all run to Gate, narrowly
     missing being hit by weapons fire. All jump
     through the Stargate.


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob remains unconscious as he lies on the bed
     and explosions sound from above. Carter sits down
     next to him laying her hand upon one of his.

  CARTER
     Oh God, I hope I've done the right thing bringing
     him here.

  MARTOUF
     From what I understand, the alternative was no
     better.

  CARTER
     True.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The klaxons sound as O'Neill, Hammond, Garshaw,
     Teal'c and Daniel wait.

  HAMMOND
     Can your man defend them against an attack?

  GARSHAW
     Only minimally.

  DANIEL
     Garshaw, what will Martouf do if the Goa'uld get
     too close?

  GARSHAW
     I regret that at the risk of capture, Martouf will
     destroy the underground compound, with himself and
     all your people with it.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill muse about that possibility.


LOCATION--VORASH DUNES


LOCATION--SELMAK'S ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is regaining consciousness. Carter is
     looking over him.

  JACOB
     Ah.

  CARTER
     Dad?

  SELMAK
     Martouf?

  MARTOUF
     I am here.

  ANNOTATION
     Explosions sound from above and Selmak sits up
     quickly.

  SELMAK
     Should we not make our escape?

  MARTOUF
     (Smiling) Yes, we should.

  CARTER
     Uh, is my Dad in there somewhere?

  JACOB
     (Shakes his head) I'm here, Sammy. Oh man, talk
     about your hangover.

  CARTER
     How are you Dad?

  JACOB
     I'm awful. Headache the size of Kuwait. There's
     too much stuff in here.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets off of the bed.

  JACOB
     Whoa!

  CARTER
     (alarmed) What?

  JACOB
     (laughs) No more arthritis! (excitedly) Holy
     Hannah! No more arthritis!

  ANNOTATION
     More explosions and they all look upwards.

  MARTOUF
     We should make our leave as soon as possible. This
     way.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     The three are running through a tunnel which is
     quickly vanishing behind them. They stop and turn
     seeing the tunnel collapse as the Ring
     Teleportation Device activates and draws them out
     of the tunnels.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks to the female technician standing
     and looking on from the Control Room.

  FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     (Through the P.A. System) Still no SG-1 signal,
     sir.


LOCATION--THE SURFACE OF VORASH

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Jacob, and Martouf are deposited by the
     transporter on the surface. They rush to the Gate
     and notice the chevrons lighting up on the Gate.

  MARTOUF
     The Goa'uld are attempting to come through the
     Gate.

  CARTER
     Not if I dial out first! (She dials quickly) We'll
     go to Earth. You two can go wherever you need to
     from there.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate engages.

  CARTER
     Did we open the Gate or did they?

  SELMAK
     We have no choice!

  ANNOTATION
     Gliders zoom overhead. Carter pulls out her GDO.

  CARTER
     (Punching numbers) Wait!


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons continue to sound. Hammond watches the
     Gate, the female technician is still looking on
     from the Control Room.

  FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     (Through the P.A. System) There's the signal.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris!

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens revealing the event horizon.


LOCATION--THE SURFACE OF VORASH

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Jacob, and Martouf rush to the wormhole,
     gliders firing upon them and missing. They jump
     through the Gate.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Hammond, and Garshaw look on as Carter,
     Jacob, and Martouf fall through the Gate landing
     on the ramp. A couple of Marine guards assist them
     to their feet, and they all walk into the SGC.
     Jacob/Selmak approaches Hammond.

  SELMAK
     I must give you thanks. You have saved my life and
     that of my new host. We thank you.

  GARSHAW
     This is wonderful news.

  HAMMOND
     Yes. Can we talk to your host?

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob bows his head, then clears his throat,
     looking around sheepishly.

  JACOB
     So when the little fella inside me is talking, do
     I sound like she does?

  TEAL'C
     That is correct.

  JACOB
     It's strange. I can feel myself talking, but it's
     not me saying the words. You know?

  O'NEILL
     Don't know. Take your word for it.

  DANIEL
     How do you feel?

  JACOB
     Well, considering I got one of those things inside
     me, pretty damn good!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks on approvingly.

  JACOB
     Listen, George. Because of this blending thing, I
     already know everything there is to know about the
     Tok'ra. You made the right call.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is smiling. Martouf and Carter, too.

  HAMMOND
     (Smiling) I hope so.

  JACOB
     I would be proud to serve as liaison between the
     Earth and these people.

  HAMMOND
     Good. Well, on that note, perhaps you can ask them
     to come with me to do a little debriefing.

  GARSHAW
     I'm afraid we cannot. We must go.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is taken aback.

  TEAL'C
     You are safe here.

  GARSHAW
     Because of the spy, the Goa'uld may already be at
     the site the Tok'ra have moved to.

  CARTER
     You can't stay a little longer?

  MARTOUF
     No, we must go quickly and stop the tunnels there
     before they are grown.

  GARSHAW
     We must move the Tok'ra to yet another new home.
     Do you not have a dialing device here?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, we slapped a little one together.

  GARSHAW
     Hmm, you made it yourself, impressive. Will you
     show it to me? I would like to put in the
     coordinates myself.

  HAMMOND
     This way.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leads them out all out of the Gate room.
     Carter and Martouf walk together.

  MARTOUF
     (To Carter) I give you my word, I will watch over
     you father as if he were my own.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate begins dialing.

  CARTER
     Thank you.

  MARTOUF
     I look forward to seeing you again.

  CARTER
     So do I.

  ANNOTATION
     Martouf walks away to stand before the Gate. Jacob
     approaches his daughter.

  JACOB
     It's ironic, ain't it?

  CARTER
     What?

  JACOB
     I was trying to find you a better assignment and
     you didn't need it. Now you've found me the best
     assignment an old soldier could dream up. Thanks,
     kid.

  CARTER
     You're welcome. Do you have to go so soon?

  JACOB
     Yeah. I have to go. Apparently, I'm the oldest and
     wisest among us.

  CARTER
     (amused) Oh jeez.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate engages. Garshaw enters the Gate room
     again with O'Neill accompanying her.

  GARSHAW
     There will come a time when the Tok'ra and the
     people of the Tau'ri will destroy the Goa'uld
     System Lords.

  O'NEILL
     This'll be a good day.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel enters the room approaching Garshaw with a
     Sagan Institute box.

  DANIEL
     Um...

  ANNOTATION
     he hands her the box.

  DANIEL
     ...this box has a signature in it we can
     recognise. Just send it through the Gate and we'll
     know you want to contact us.

  GARSHAW
     Thank you. Come, Selmak.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob and Carter embrace warmly.

  JACOB
     I love you.

  CARTER
     I love you too, Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     They let go, and Jacob turns to O'Neill.

  JACOB
     Selmak says, let me see if I can translate this,
     don't call us, we'll call you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill smiles. Martouf, Garshaw and Jacob walk up
     the ramp and enter the wormhole. Carter watches as
     the Stargate closes and sighs sadly.
