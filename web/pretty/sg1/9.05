Daniel, Mitchell and Teal'c only have time to exchange looks before Azdak returns with four other men, all carrying staff weapons which they prime and point at the SGC members.

Azdak raises his head, staying on his knees.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>AZDAK: (plaintively) Please, forgive us. It has been so long, we began to fear you would not return.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel gets up and walks to the throne, leaning close to Vala. She is watching the play with a delighted smile on her face.

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel leans back and glares directly at Vala, who keeps an impassive expression while giving him a sidelong glance. Daniel eventually steps back, still unhappy. Vala smirks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The actress raises her hand towards Actor 1 as if she wears a Goa'uld ribbon device. Actor 1 reaches into his tunic and pulls out a long red scarf, making exploding sounds in his mouth as he pretends to writhe in agony before falling to the floor. Daniel collapses back onto his seat at the staircase, exchanging a frustrated look with Teal'c.</td></tr>
