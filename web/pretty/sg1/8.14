<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill gets out of his truck and pulls some beer and groceries from the back seat. He walks to his front door, and spotting the door is open, puts down his groceries, takes off his sunglasses and reaches behind him to pull out a gun. He pushes the door open and moves cautiously into the house. Carefully checking the hallway, he advances into the living room and aims his weapon at Senator Robert Kinsey, who is standing in front of the fireplace. Kinsey holds up a bottle of whisky.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Meaning, you were no longer useful so they kicked you out on your ass.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>KINSEY: That's a rather crude way of putting it, but...yes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Why didn't they just shoot you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>KINSEY: Believe me, that was a consideration. Which is why, when they requested a meeting a few days ago, I suggested a nice, public venue. They made a very interesting offer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>KINSEY: In exchange for a large cash payment, the Trust wants me to arrange a meeting with General Miroslav Kiselev, the Russian defence minister.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>O'NEILL: I thought they already had connections with the Russian military?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>KINSEY: This isn't just a connection. Kiselev exercises operational authority over all of Russia's armed forces, including (he emphasises) their nuclear arsenal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>O'NEILL: And he just happens to be a good friend of yours.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>KINSEY: (chortling) After the fall of Communism, he was one of a number of officers assigned to secret talks with the West aimed at military co-operation. He was a hard-liner even then. His country was falling apart, but he came at us as though we were the ones at a disadvantage. He and I developed a mutual respect.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>O'NEILL: What does the Trust want with him?</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>KINSEY: Well, they wouldn't give me any specifics, but they know we entered into a deal with the Russians for control of the gate. And they also know that there's a growing sentiment in Moscow that we haven't been keeping up our end of the bargain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>O'NEILL: You think they're trying to turn the Russians against us?</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>KINSEY: It's ambitious, I know, even for the Trust, but from what I hear, after you put a crimp in their little plan to use symbiote poison to wipe out the Goa'uld, there's been a change of attitude. They're no longer willing to stay in the shadows and bide their time. They want to make a direct grab for power. And that's why I came to you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>O'NEILL: (sarcastic) Yes, you've always struck me as the hero type.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Aggravated, Kinsey bounds to his feet, whisky glass in hand, pacing before O'Neill.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>KINSEY: (earnest) You may question my methods, but everything I did was for God and country. For the Trust to ally themselves with a foreign power against the United States of America, well, that's just something I can't condone.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Kinsey, please! Spare me the diatribe. They kicked you when you were down and you want revenge. It's as simple as that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>KINSEY: The truth is, my motives are irrelevant. The Trust has become an imminent threat to the sovereignty of this nation. Now. What are you gonna do about it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, it would be a problem. Technically, the gate's only here on loan. If the Russians decide they want it back, things could get sticky.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Is it possible Kinsey is simply lying?</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>O'NEILL: (emphatic) That is always possible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>CARTER: Has he asked for anything in return for the information?</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Protection.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>CARTER: Maybe he should co-operate. This could be our chance to get somebody on the inside. Infiltrate the organisation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>CARTER: They've arranged to meet you at a remote location. My guess is that they'll make you leave your car while they drive you to a second location where the actual meeting will take place. And we're gonna have to keep back a fair distance, so as not to arouse suspicion. But, we will be monitoring your conversations by means of this listening device that we've fitted into the collar of your shirt.</td></tr>
