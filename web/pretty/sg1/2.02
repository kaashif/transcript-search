A Goa'uld death glider sweeps over the scene, rising back into the sky. The camera follows the glider's path of destruction, revealing fleeing villagers and more explosions across the beach. SG-1 and at least one other team is there, alternating between firing at the gliders and rushing back to the Gate. Carter drops to her knees next to one injured man, removing her helmet. O'Neill, cradling a child in his arms, runs past her.</td></tr>

She hangs her head, then looks up. Her eyes flash yellow...she's a Goa'uld! O'Neill runs up, missing the eye flash.</td></tr>
