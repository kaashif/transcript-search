In The Line Of Duty
TEASER

LOCATION--NASYA

  ANNOTATION
     The episode opens with a shot of a statue
     depicting a bearded man. In the background, an
     explosion rocks a peaceful beachfront. A Goa'uld
     death glider sweeps over the scene, rising back
     into the sky. The camera follows the glider's path
     of destruction, revealing fleeing villagers and
     more explosions across the beach. SG-1 and at
     least one other team is there, alternating between
     firing at the gliders and rushing back to the
     Gate. Carter drops to her knees next to one
     injured man, removing her helmet. O'Neill,
     cradling a child in his arms, runs past her.

  O'NEILL
     Let's go, Captain. Those gliders are coming back
     around!

  CARTER
     This man's alive!

  O'NEILL
     (forcefully) Cannot wait!

  ANNOTATION
     The glider fires again, sweeping past an active
     Stargate. Daniel is standing on the stairs leading
     to the event horizon, ducking to protect himself
     from the attack. When the glider is past, he
     stands again and waves for the remaining Nasyans.

  DANIEL
     Okay, come on, come on. Don't panic, we'll have
     you out of here in a minute.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     He hands over the boy

  O'NEILL
     I gotta go back for Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns and runs back down the beach. Daniel
     hurries away from the Gate to two villagers, one
     of whom is badly burnt and unconscious.

  DANIEL
     (to the conscious Nasyan) Go, go, I got him...
     (calls) Medic! He's alive, but I think he's gonna
     wish he wasn't. Let's get him outta here.

  ANNOTATION
     He helps the Medic carry the man away.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is still doing chest compressions on the
     same man. She listens at his mouth, then breaths.
     She listens again, lowering her head to breath
     again. This time, the man reaches up and cups the
     back of her head, holding her in place. She
     struggles, finally escaping and turning to one
     side. She hangs her head, then looks up. Her eyes
     flash yellow...she's a Goa'uld! O'Neill runs up,
     missing the eye flash.

  O'NEILL
     Carter! We've got to go!

  ANNOTATION
     She turns to face him, dazed. He sees blood on her
     lip.

  O'NEILL
     You alright?

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  O'NEILL
     Let's get him outta here, come on.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to pick the man up, but Carter stops
     him.

  CARTER
     Dead! Had some kind of seizure. Bit his own
     tongue.

  ANNOTATION
     They run to the Stargate, apparently the last ones
     to go through. The gate room has been turned into
     some kind of emergency triage. Medics are
     scurrying about, seeing who they can save and
     transporting others to the infirmary. Hammond is
     standing in the corner, watching the chaos around
     him.

  HAMMOND
     (shouting over the din) I want a full medical
     quarantine until these people can be examined.
     (walking up the ramp towards Daniel) Colonel
     O'Neill and the rest?

  DANIEL
     (pulls off his glasses, rubbing one eye) Right
     behind me, and a dozen Jaffa right behind them.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c come through the Gate,
     Carter in the middle and leaning on Teal'c's side.

  HAMMOND
     Lock it up!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks back up at the iris.

  O'NEILL
     Carter? You okay?

  CARTER
     Yeah, fine. Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     She slowly scans the room.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and a member of another team are present.
     Daniel is handing out a report and takes his seat,
     already speaking.

  DANIEL
     There hadn't been any Goa'uld interference on this
     planet for over three centuries. The Nasyans are
     a...were a peaceful people. They were eager to
     form an alliance and aid us in setting up a
     research outpost. There was no warning this attack
     was coming. We hadn't even spotted the mothership
     by the time the Gliders assaulted the village.

  HAMMOND
     It's not normal for the Goa'ulds to suddenly just
     show up and wipe out peaceful people for no
     apparent reason, is it?

  DANIEL
     In the past there was usually some reason, most
     often they seem to attack civilisations that are
     advancing to a point where their technology could
     be a threat, but that wasn't the case here.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe they found out we were there.

  DANIEL
     Well, how could they know? Or more importantly,
     why did this particular Goa'uld care?

  O'NEILL
     They might have been a little concerned because we
     just kicked the crap out of Apophis.

  DANIEL
     Well, the truth is we still understand very little
     about their society.

  TEAL'C
     I have seen the Goa'uld wipe out entire
     civilizations--no reason, simply because it gave
     them pleasure.

  DANIEL
     So what, Nasya was just next on the list? Part of
     me wishes it was that simple, but I don't want to
     underestimate them.

  CARTER
     (coldly) Maybe their reasons just weren't made
     apparent to you, Teal'c. I mean, you are just a
     Jaffa. (off everyone's startled reactions, covers
     her tracks) All...all I meant was that Apophis
     wouldn't necessarily have explained everything to
     Teal'c even if he was First Prime. Would he?

  TEAL'C
     That is true.

  DANIEL
     I agree with Sam. I think we have to assume the
     Goa'uld are more complex as a society than we're
     giving them credit for.

  CARTER
     The better you understand the enemy the better
     prepared you are in conflict.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill appears surprised by this statement.

  DANIEL
     Exactly.

  HAMMOND
     What's the status of the Nasyan survivors?

  DANIEL
     Well, we managed to recuse 237 people. The
     critically burned and some of the overflow our
     infirmary couldn't handle were transferred to the
     Air Force Academy hospital. The rest are awaiting
     relocation.

  HAMMOND
     Proceed.

  DANIEL
     Sir, I think it's important to try and find the
     reason why Nasya became a Goa'uld target.

  HAMMOND
     Agreed. But relocation is the first priority. I'm
     assigning the three new SG teams 10 through 12 to
     coordinate with you. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone stands and leaves, except for Carter and
     O'Neill who are gathering their things. O'Neill
     glances at her.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, Carter, I hate to be a nag about this but ol'
     Doc Fraiser says you haven't been checked out yet?

  CARTER
     I'll go right now. Wouldn't want to break
     post-mission protocol, right, Colonel?

  ANNOTATION
     She slugs his shoulder, causing him to pause for a
     moment.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Scene opens on the back of Carter's neck. Fingers
     in rubber gloves appear, parting the hair and
     gently massaging the back of Carter's neck for
     signs of Goa'uld entry. She slides her hand back
     towards the front, checking the glands under
     Carter's jaw.

  FRAISER
     Sorry to have to do this.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns and picks up a tongue depressor.

  FRAISER
     All right, open.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter obeys and Fraiser shines a flashlight in
     her mouth.

  FRAISER
     You had a sore throat lately?

  CARTER
     A little, why?

  FRAISER
     There's a small abrasion back there. I have to do
     a swab. (opens a package) And open.

  ANNOTATION
     She inserts the swab. Carter nearly gags as
     Fraiser takes the sample.

  FRAISER
     Cassandra's been asking about you.

  CARTER
     (obviously lost) Cassandra...Yeah, I've been so
     busy lately.

  FRAISER
     She understands. Okay! You just let me know if it
     gets worse.

  CARTER
     I'm free to go out tomorrow, though, right? We're
     searching for possible relocation sites for the
     Nasyans.

  FRAISER
     Sure. Cassandra's gonna be at the hospital with me
     tomorrow, so why don't you stop by and spend a
     little time with her first, you know, if you can.

  CARTER
     I will.

  FRAISER
     Okay.


LOCATION--USAF ACADEMY HOSPITAL

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is standing next to a patient's bed,
     speaking into a small tape recorder. The patient
     is completely wrapped in gauze, his eyes and mouth
     the only parts visible.

  FRAISER
     Patient has third degree burns to over 80% of his
     body. So far no signs of infection. (turns off
     tape recorder and mutters) Incredible. (turns as
     Carter enters) Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     She begins making notes in the folder she's
     holding.

  CARTER
     Is this one of the Nasyans we saved?

  FRAISER
     Yeah, he should be dead. Cassandra is in my
     office. Now, I still have rounds to make, but you
     know where it is?

  CARTER
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser offers a smile before turning, leaving the
     patient's room. Carter lags behind, looking
     suspiciously at the man. She turns and leaves.
     When the door closes, the man's chest suddenly
     lights up and glows, beams of light flowing
     towards the center of his abdomen.


LOCATION--FRAISER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Cassandra is painting a picture of two people
     standing under a rainbow. She smudges her finger
     with yellow paint and adds some color to the
     rainbow as Carter approaches from outside. She
     knocks, coming in as Cassie is turning around.

  CARTER
     Hey there.

  CASSANDRA
     Sam!

  ANNOTATION
     She runs to Carter, then realizes she has yellow
     paint on her fingers. She turns back and wipes
     them off.

  CARTER
     Wow, nice painting.

  CASSANDRA
     You really like it? My teacher at school says I
     have talent.

  CARTER
     I love it.

  ANNOTATION
     Cassandra runs to Carter. Carter kneels to embrace
     the girl.

  CASSANDRA
     I missed you.

  CARTER
     I know, I'm sorry. I've been so busy.

  CASSANDRA
     Very busy.

  ANNOTATION
     Cassandra's eyes widen as they embrace. Carter can
     feel the girl tense. Cassie ends the hug and backs
     up as Carter rises.

  CARTER
     Cassandra, what is it?

  ANNOTATION
     The girl doesn't answer, instead running across
     the room and hiding behind the couch. Carter,
     realizing she's been discovered, tightens her jaw
     and her eyes glow. She moves quickly across the
     room.


LOCATION--CONTROL CENTER

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and O'Neill are standing next to the star
     map, apparently examining possible relocation
     sites for the Nasyans.

  HAMMOND
     It would be earier on the Nasyans if there were
     already an active civilization willing to
     cooperate.

  O'NEILL
     I'll bet you the folks on P3X-422 would be
     willing...

  TECHNICIAN
     (interrupting) Colonel O'Neill, there's an urgent
     call for you, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     (going to the phone) O'Neill.


LOCATION--USAF ACADEMY HOSPITAL

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is escorting O'Neill down the hall.

  FRAISER
     Thanks for coming so quickly.

  O'NEILL
     What's going on with her?

  FRAISER
     I'm not sure, she won't talk to me. She said she'd
     see you and only you.

  ANNOTATION
     They reach a door and Fraiser tries the knob, but
     it's locked. She looks up at O'Neill, then knocks.

  FRAISER
     Cassandra, it's just me honey. I've got Colonel
     O'Neill with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Cassie is visible approaching the door from
     inside. She turns the lock, then turns and
     retreats back into the room.

  O'NEILL
     (waves his hand) Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     When he gets no response. He approaches her and
     presses his back to the wall, sliding down until
     he's sitting next to her.

  O'NEILL
     Janet says you've been a little upset since Carter
     was here.

  ANNOTATION
     Cassie moves over, letting him put his arm around
     her.

  O'NEILL
     What happened?

  CASSANDRA
     She said she'd kill me if I told.

  O'NEILL
     Well, you don't mean kill you, kill you. (Cassie
     nods) No, I doubt that.

  CASSANDRA
     She said she would.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is obviously upset and kneels in front of
     Cassie.

  O'NEILL
     (firmly) Cass, Sam loves you. She'd never do
     anything to hurt you.

  CASSANDRA
     She would now.

  ANNOTATION
     She puts her head on O'Neill's shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     Why?

  CASSANDRA
     She's a Goa'uld.


LOCATION--SGC HALLWAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns a corner, walking quickly towards her
     destination. She pushes her way into the locker
     room where Daniel and Teal'c are preparing. She
     looks around the room, then turns to them.

  CARTER
     (angrily) Where's the Colonel? We're due to get
     out of here in five minutes!

  DANIEL
     Well, he left us a message. Said he'd meet us in
     the Gate room.

  CARTER
     Well, step on it then!

  ANNOTATION
     She storms out.

  DANIEL
     (to Teal'c) What was that?


LOCATION--GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is stationary. Carter is pacing
     before the ramp and glares up at the Control Room.
     Fraiser, Hammond and a technician are watching
     her. She sighs and continues to pace, looking back
     up at the Stargate. The left-side doors open and
     Daniel enters with Teal'c. CARTER Where's Colonel
     O'NEILL? [O'Neill enters from the right-side
     doors, behind Carter.

  O'NEILL
     Stand down, campers. We're on a hold.

  CARTER
     Why?

  O'NEILL
     (moving to Carter's side) I dunno, some computer
     glitch.

  ANNOTATION
     He casually raises his arm and jams his fist
     against her right shoulder. She jerks away,
     looking where he hit her. He lowers his arm,
     revealing a syringe.

  CARTER
     (angrily) What the hell was that?

  FRAISER
     (disbelieving) That was enough to take down an
     elephant! Carter picks up a rifle, turning it on
     O'Neill and affecting a deep, Goa'uld voice

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Open the Stargate!

  DANIEL
     Jack, what the hell is going on?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Open the Gate now! (calmly) I command you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter's eyes flash.

  ANNOTATION
     An airman rushes forward, raising his gun and
     shooting her in the right leg with a tranquilizer
     dart. She pulls it out and raises her gun to
     attack him, but O'Neill knocks her arm down. She
     escapes his grip and punches him, knocking the
     colonel to the ground with a grunt and rolling
     towards the wall. Teal'c steadies his staff
     weapon. CARTER/JOLINAR Open the Gate now... [She
     pulls a grenade from her supplies and takes the
     pin out and drops it.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     ...or we will all die!

  ANNOTATION
     Other airmen raise their guns to fire.

  O'NEILL
     (standing) Hold your fire! Teal'c...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill waves for him to lower the staff and
     Teal'c does.

  AIRMAN
     I have the shot, sir.

  O'NEILL
     And if she drops that grenade, what? (To
     Carter/Jolinar) Nobody's gonna open that Stargate.
     We're all gonna live, or we're all gonna die,
     right here.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Let me go! I must go!

  O'NEILL
     (firmly) Not gonna happen.

  ANNOTATION
     The drugs finally begin to take effect and she
     slowly crumples to the ground. O'Neill lunges
     forward, wrapping his hand around hers and holding
     the grenade tightly. Fraiser turns, hurrying out
     of the control room. The airmen approach and
     O'Neill hands Carter over, allowing them to take
     her away. He bends down, picking up the grenade
     and replacing the pin. O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c
     watch them take their teammate away.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c are all standing, with
     Fraiser and Hammond seated. Fraiser is checking
     her medical reports on Carter as O'Neill
     approaches the table.

  O'NEILL
     I didn't know. I wasn't sure until I saw her lose
     it down there. Cassie was the one who suspected.

  FRAISER
     Cassandra still has traces of naquadah in her
     blood. I think there may be some connection--a
     reaction that made her sense the Goa'uld.

  HAMMOND
     How in the world did it get into Captain Carter?

  FRAISER
     Sir, I don't know what to say. I examined Captain
     Carter myself. There were no visible signs of
     entry. I mean, she had a small abrasion on the
     back of her throat, but it could have been
     anything.

  HAMMOND
     Are you saying it entered through her mouth?

  FRAISER
     The parasite's goal is to attach itself to the
     brain stem. The soft tissue at the back of the
     throat is as good a place as any to start.

  O'NEILL
     (rubbing the bridge of his nose) Oh, wait a
     minute, wait a minute. Oh my God, she was giving
     some guy on that planet mouth-to-mouth. There was
     blood but she said the guy just bit his tongue
     before he died.

  FRAISER
     If a Goa'uld can infest a human with no detectable
     physical signs, then we're gonna have to start
     giving all personnel who go through the Gate an
     ultrasound or an MRI.

  HAMMOND
     For now, let's make sure we haven't let any more
     Goa'ulds through the Gate this time.

  DANIEL
     What would a Goa'uld be doing in a Nasyan man in
     the first place? I mean, we certainly didn't
     notice any of them acting...Goa'uld-ish.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe it was a setup, trying to get a spy into one
     of us.

  TEAL'C
     It is possible the Goa'uld within Captain Carter
     has already placed a device of destruction on this
     base.

  HAMMOND
     If there's any tampering here, I want it found.
     Teal'c, I'd like you to help. You know better than
     anyone what to look for.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods his agreement.

  DANIEL
     Oh, what are we going to do about Sam?

  O'NEILL
     We're gonna get that damn thing out of her is what
     we're gonna do!

  DANIEL
     Well, that didn't really work with Kawalsky. And
     if any of those NID guys like Colonel Maybourne
     find out about this, then...

  O'NEILL
     Well, they're not going to! Right, General?

  HAMMOND
     Agreed. I'm not giving up on Captain Carter,
     either. But until someone presents me with a
     viable option, I'm putting you in charge of
     interrogating the prisoner.

  O'NEILL
     Due respect, Sir, I don't think that thing in her
     head's going to tell me anything.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel, we need to know what that Goa'uld's doing
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks out.

  O'NEILL
     (softly) Yes, sir.


LOCATION--USAF ACADEMY HOSPITAL

  ANNOTATION
     A doctor is entering the room with the bandaged
     man, otherwise known as the Ashrak. He is walking
     backwards, leading a cart with a monitor on it
     into the room. We later learn his name is Dr.
     Jacobs.

  JACOBS
     Sorry to bother you. Just a quick test here. Okay
     now, we're gonna have to get rid of some of those
     bandages.

  ANNOTATION
     As he bends over the patient to begin cutting, the
     Ashrak's hand shoots up and grabs the doctor by
     the throat.


LOCATION--USAF ACADEMY HOSPITAL

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks into another room at the hospital. A
     woman is standing by the window, looking outside.
     We learn soon her name is Talia.

  DANIEL
     (seeing the woman standing) Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns and walks back to her bed.

  DANIEL
     Excuse me.

  TALIA
     (crossing her arms over her chest, her voice
     shaky) Your world is an amazing place.

  DANIEL
     It can be. Um, I'm...I'm Daniel.

  TALIA
     You are one of the men responsible for saving us.

  DANIEL
     Yeah.

  TALIA
     We owe you great thanks.

  DANIEL
     Can we, uh, can we talk a minute?


LOCATION--SGC LOCKER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting on one of the benches, staring
     off into space. Teal'c enters.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Thought you were helping with the sweep of the
     base.

  TEAL'C
     I am on my way.

  ANNOTATION
     He raises his head slightly and moves to sit
     behind O'Neill.

  TEAL'C
     This is difficult.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. Yeah, it is.

  TEAL'C
     Assault the Goa'uld's ego. Make him appear
     foolish. He may then reveal the things you wish to
     learn simply to make himself appear more powerful.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, come on, Teal'c. They're smarter than that.

  TEAL'C
     I have seen many Goa'uld strategies revealed and
     certain victories lost because of Goa'uld
     arrogance. It is the Goa'uld's greatest weakness.

  O'NEILL
     (sighs) Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     He stands and walks to the door.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill. When you speak to her, do not see
     your friend.

  O'NEILL
     How do you do that?

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off.


LOCATION--HOLDING CELLS

  ANNOTATION
     Red laser beams are projected behind the bars.
     Carter/Jolinar is standing in the center of the
     cell, her hands clasped behind her back in typical
     Goa'uld fashion. O'Neill knocks and the guard
     posted checks the window before letting him in.
     O'Neill looks in the cell, then waves the guard
     out. The man obediently leaves.

  O'NEILL
     So, you and I have got to have a little talk. You
     really screwed up here, you know. I mean, you
     really blew it.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     (shaking her head) You are weak.

  O'NEILL
     Who's behind bars right now?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Your tactics will not work on me.

  O'NEILL
     Not buying it, huh?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     You must let me go.

  O'NEILL
     Ah...no.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     You really have no idea why this is happening.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits down on the cot.

  O'NEILL
     (muttering) And I guess you don't feel like
     telling me.

  ANNOTATION
     She crosses her arms defensively across her chest,
     her face hidden by shadows.


LOCATION--TALIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Talia are sitting on the bed. He hands
     her a photograph.

  DANIEL
     This is a picture of the man the Goa'uld came
     from.

  TALIA
     (Looking at the picture, touching the man's face)
     It's my husband.

  DANIEL
     One of the other Nasyans recognized him, and we
     found this in our video archive.

  TALIA
     (voice shaky) And something was inside of him?

  DANIEL
     I know how difficult this is for you. I lost my
     wife to the Goa'uld.

  TALIA
     I'm sorry.

  DANIEL
     It's important that you tell me if you noticed
     anything different about your husband lately.

  ANNOTATION
     She shakes her head negatively.

  DANIEL
     I mean, anything, an injury, uh, new scars, maybe
     a...

  TALIA
     Wait...

  ANNOTATION
     She touches Daniel just below his right ear.

  TALIA
     Here. But it was months ago.

  DANIEL
     Months ago? You never noticed anything since then?

  ANNOTATION
     Talia shakes her head no.

  DANIEL
     I mean, he wasn't acting strange? I mean, wasn't
     violent, I mean his eyes didn't glow?

  ANNOTATION
     She turns away, her eyes tearing up and Daniel
     realizes he's being a little too enthusiastic.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry. Why don't I let you rest?

  ANNOTATION
     Talia nods and Daniel leaves. As he's leaving, he
     walks past the Ashrak's room. The camera moves in
     to reveal bed is empty and Dr. Jacobs is laying
     unconscious on the floor. The Ashrak is standing
     in the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror.
     He pulls the mask off his face and then unravels
     the gloves on his hand. He appears to choke, then
     leans forward and spits something into the sink.
     It's a Goa'uld device shaped like a Y that he fits
     over the middle fingers of his right hand. It
     activates, three white beams coming together to
     make a ball of light about an inch away from his
     palm. He smiles happily.

  ANNOTATION
     Some time later, Fraiser arrives. She sees Dr.
     Jacobs's supplies on the bed and sighs at her
     colleague's absent-mindedness, picking the tubes
     up and placing them on the cart. She walks to the
     top of the bed, checking the stats and marking
     what they say on her chart. She walks out, not
     realizing that the man in the bed is Dr. Jacobs.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is glaring at Carter/Jolinar through the
     bars. She is staring back, her eyes hidden by
     shadows. Finally, she breaks the silence.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Let me go. (stands up and approaches the bars) Let
     me go through the Stargate. I will find another
     host and send your friend back to you.

  O'NEILL
     (stands as well) You can do that? Leave a host
     without killing them?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Yes. It is possible, but not easy. I could die,
     but I promise I will try.

  O'NEILL
     The Nasyan man died when you left him.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     (closes her eyes) The Nasyan man died first, that
     is why I left him. He was beyond my natural
     abilities to heal.

  O'NEILL
     What were you doing in him in the first place?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Carter's mind would be intact. She would return to
     you as you knew her before.

  O'NEILL
     You know I can't trust you.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     I could have killed you and many others when you
     stopped me from going through the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     You didn't want to die yourself.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     It would not have killed me. I am too valuable.

  O'NEILL
     Which is exactly why we'll never let you go.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks to the door.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     I have done nothing to harm you. But you would not
     let me go even if you did believe me.

  ANNOTATION
     She pauses, then speaks in Carter's regular voice.

  CARTER
     Oh God, he's telling you the truth! Please, Jack!

  ANNOTATION
     He looks down, obviously disturbed as he knocks
     for the guard.

  CARTER
     No, Jack! Please, don't leave me, please! Give me
     a chance!

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and O'Neill leaves.

  CARTER
     Don't leave me like this! Please!

  ANNOTATION
     Turning cold again, once again speaking in Goa'uld
     tones.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     What will it take?


LOCATION--USAF ACADEMY HOSPITAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Ashrak pushes open a curtain. He has changed
     clothes with the doctor, now wearing a blue Air
     Force shirt and a lab jacket. He glares at the
     patient on the hospital bed. He opens his hand,
     revealing the Goa'uld device still on his hand. He
     holds it over the unconscious patient's head,
     revealing the man's skull. The device deactivates
     and the Ashrak leaves.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING CELL

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c enters the room, assuming the
     hands-behind-back position.

  TEAL'C
     You have requested my presence?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Jaffa, you must convince the humans to let me go.

  TEAL'C
     They will not let you go.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     They are impressive. The Tau'ri have become very
     powerful in the time since the Goa'uld reign here.
     Certainly the System Lords will not allow this to
     go unchecked. I can provide the humans with
     information that can help them defend against
     attack.

  TEAL'C
     They are more powerful than you know. Already, a
     Goa'uld attack on Earth has been thwarted.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Then a more powerful assault is already being
     planned.

  TEAL'C
     They are not fools. They believe you are here to
     plant a seed of that destruction.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     (approaches the bars) Not all Goa'uld are the
     same. There are a few that oppose the System Lords
     and their ways. You must have heard of the Tok'ra.

  TEAL'C
     (steps forward) Every Goa'uld seeks power for his
     own reason and would betray his own brother to
     achieve it.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Some seek power for a greater purpose. Not every
     Goa'uld is an enemy to the people of this planet.
     The Tok'ra are real, no matter what Apophis has
     told you.

  TEAL'C
     I have yet to meet one.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     You have now. I am Jolinar of Malkshur.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c's eyes widen. He turns, giving her one last
     look before he leaves the room using his card.


LOCATION--TALIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel enters to see a doctor standing over the
     bed.

  DANIEL
     Oh, uh, excuse me, sorry. I just wanted to check
     on Talia.

  ANNOTATION
     The doctor turns, revealing that it is the Ashrak.

  DANIEL
     How is she?

  ASHRAK
     (off-handedly) She's good.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off. Daniel approaches the bed, looking
     at Talia and then looking back over his shoulder.


LOCATION--USAF ACADEMY HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     A staff member is walking down the hall, carrying
     a stack of blue folders. Fraiser exits a room and
     stops her.

  FRAISER
     Rita, have you seen Doctor Jacobs recently?

  RITA
     Uh-uh.

  FRAISER
     (sighs and looks to the side) Okay, uh, what about
     the most recent bloodwork done on the patient in
     412?

  ANNOTATION
     She eyes the stack of folders.

  PETER
     (looking through the folders) Here it is.

  FRAISER
     Good, thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Rita walks off as Fraiser opens the file. Her eyes
     widen and she rushes down the hall, bursting into
     412 and peeling back the bandages to reveal her
     suspicions are correct; the man in the bed is the
     missing doctor.

  FRAISER
     Dr. Jacobs!

  ANNOTATION
     She looks at the monitor, confused.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING CELLS

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and O'Neill are going to visit
     Carter/Jolinar.

  TEAL'C
     There is an old legend among the Jaffa for them to
     speak of concerning a group of Goa'uld who opposed
     the ways of the System Lords. This group is called
     the Tok'ra. This Goa'uld, Jolinar of Malkshur,
     claims to be part of that group.

  O'NEILL
     Can you be sure he is who he says he is?

  TEAL'C
     I cannot.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Unfortunately, we do not carry identification.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, let's try to build a little trust here,
     shall we? One of the Nasyans we brought back was
     very badly burned. But somehow he just got up out
     of his hospital bed and disappeared. Who is he?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     It must be the Ashrak.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks to Teal'c for translation.

  TEAL'C
     It means hunter.

  O'NEILL
     A Goa'uld?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Yes. An assassin of the highest rank who carries
     out the orders of the System Lords.

  O'NEILL
     Who's he here to kill?

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Me.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, minus Carter, is present, informing Hammond
     of what they've discovered.

  TEAL'C
     The missing Nasyan is an Ashrak. A Goa'uld
     assassin sent by the System Lords to eliminate
     Jolinar.

  DANIEL
     That's the name of the Goa'uld in Sam?

  TEAL'C
     It is. Jolinar once tried to overthrow one of the
     System Lords but was defeated when Apophis joined
     the battle. He escaped during the slaughter of his
     armies.

  O'NEILL
     It seems this Jolinar is wanted in Goa'uld town.

  TEAL'C
     He claims to be part of the Tok'ra.

  DANIEL
     (peering out at the Stargate, turns at that word)
     Resistance.

  TEAL'C
     The Tok'ra is a small alliance of Goa'uld who
     oppose the System Lords. It was my teacher Bra'tac
     who first spoke to me of them.

  HAMMOND
     Well, this Goa'uld inside Carter could be
     lying...Spinning a tale to gain our trust.

  O'NEILL
     It's quite a spin.

  HAMMOND
     The sweep of the base has turned up no evidence.
     There's been no tampering with the base computer.
     We can't find a single sign of sabotage.

  DANIEL
     (walks to the table) That's why Jolinar didn't
     reveal himself to be a Goa'uld. He was actually
     hiding out in the Nasyan man.

  TEAL'C
     Until he was hunted down by the Ashrak. When he
     realised we may have helped him escape through the
     Stargate...

  HAMMOND
     He improvised. So where are we?

  O'NEILL
     Bottom line, Sir? We may have a Goa'uld out there
     who's on a mission to kill Carter.

  DANIEL
     And we don't even know what he looks like.

  ANNOTATION
     The Ashrak is looking through a window at an army

     There's a knock on the door and the guard opens
     it, allowing Daniel into the holding area.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     (standing) Daniel Jackson.

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     You care about Samantha Carter as much as O'Neill
     and Teal'c.

  DANIEL
     Yes, I do.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Yet, this is the first time you have come to see
     me.

  DANIEL
     (takes a pen and notebook from his pocket) I came
     to see if you could give us a description of the
     Ashrak.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     I will know his face only in the moments before he
     tortures me to death...killing your friend along
     with me.

  DANIEL
     Well, there's no way he's getting in here.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     You are not stupid, Daniel, nor am I.

  DANIEL
     He doesn't even know for sure you're here on this
     planet, let alone in this base.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     He is Goa'uld, he will find me. It's what he does.
     Letting me go, trusting me, is the only chance of
     saving your friend Samantha.

  DANIEL
     Then I'm sorry. (steps forward) I'm sorry, Sam.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Alive, I can be a powerful ally. Dead, I am
     useless to you.

  DANIEL
     Then you're gonna have to give us more than empty
     promises.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     I can give her back to you.

  DANIEL
     We can't let you go.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     I'm not talking about Samantha, Daniel.

     Airmen are loading trucks, preparing to take the
     Nasyans back to the SGC for relocation. The Ashrak
     has changed from his uniform to camos in order to
     blend in. He climbs into one of the trucks on the
     passenger side. The driver turns to him, frowning.

  DRIVER
     Who are you?

  ASHRAK

  DRIVER
     You're not John.

  ANNOTATION
     The Ashrak raises his hand, the device shining a

     if he's been hypnotized and starts the truck. They
     drive off.

     Daniel, O'Neill and Teal'c are there debating
     Carter/Jolinar's offer.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, it's a ploy. He's playing on your greatest
     weakness.

  DANIEL
     Well, that may be so, but this many be the only
     chance we have to see Carter again.

  TEAL'C
     I believe Jolinar speaks the truth.

  DANIEL
     Look, he told me about this resistance. Now, they
     have a totally different way of life from the
     Goa'uld we know. They don't believe in taking
     hosts against their will.

  O'NEILL
     Right, like Carter and this Nasyan guy?

  DANIEL
     No, he had no choice. He wants to leave Carter.

  HAMMOND
     But if they don't believe in taking hosts, how do
     they survive?

  DANIEL
     They take humans who are about to die. Who choose
     to continue to live and co-exist with the Goa'uld.
     Now according to Jolinar this can be a rewarding
     relationship.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, I'm sorry, I know what this means to you.
     But I will never, never trust a Goa'uld.

     leaning against the wall, arms crossed, and lazily
     motioning people through as they clear.

  AIRMAN
     Go ahead, soldier. Uh-huh.

     The Ashrak approaches and pulls his Goa'uld device
     off, placing his hand under the scanner.

  AIRMAN

  ASHRAK
     It's a ring. (puts it back on) Want a closer look?

     He raises his hand and the light shines in the
     airman's face. The airman freezes as the Ashrak

  ASHRAK
     Interesting weapons these humans use.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps over one of the dead airmen and rips open
     the cell door.

  ASHRAK
     (in Goa'uld voice,) Kree shak, Jolinar. By decree
     of the Goa'uld System Lords you will die with
     dishonor by the power of the Hara'kash.

  ANNOTATION
     He activates the device on his hand.

  CARTER/JOLINAR
     Hear this. The days of the Goa'uld System Lords
     are numbered. Tell them that I died with hope. My
     death only feeds the fire that burns strong in the
     Tok'ra.

  ANNOTATION
     The Ashrak raises his hand and hits Carter/Jolinar
     with the device, apparently the Hara'kash. Her
     head is thrown violently back, her skull exposed
     where the light is shining on it. She grimaces,
     her eyes wide with pain. Eventually, she collapses
     to the floor. The Ashrak keeps up his assault
     until he's certain she's down for the count. He
     disengages the device just as airmen rush in with
     guns ready. He stands.

  ASHRAK
     She's dead. Let's go.

     They're not gonna let you go.

  ASHRAK
     Silence! Open the Stargate!

  ANNOTATION
     He shoots shoots the bulletproof glass in front of
     Hammond, causing the general to duck.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  FRAISER
     Let's cardiovert one more time. 30 joules.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c strides purposefully in, a zat gun at his
     side.

  TEAL'C
     I am sorry Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     He fires, hitting both Daniel and the Ashrak with
     the first shot. Daniel collapses and opens
     Teal'c's line of fire. The Ashrak begins to steady
     his gun to fire again, but Teal'c shoots him a
     second time before he can. The Ashrak jerks,
     falling to the ramp. Teal'c lowers his zat and
     walks to the ramp, kneeling next to a jerking
     Daniel.

  TEAL'C
     Are you injured?

  DANIEL
     (strained) Dumb question. But, thank you. I think.

  TEAL'C
     You are welcome.

  DANIEL
     Just don't ever do that again.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor is registering a flatline.

  FRAISER
     The parasite is dead. (turns to looks at O'Neill
     before she continues) Try another milligram of
     epi, then prepare for de-fib.

  ANNOTATION
     They snap to action.

  MEDIC 1
     She's out of de-fib!

  FRAISER
     She's got a pulse!

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser pulls on stethoscope and listens.

  MEDIC 1
     Faint but stable.

  ANNOTATION
     The medic applies a bag, possibly helping Carter
     to start breathing again. Fraiser looks up at a
     monitor, smiling at what she sees. The bag is
     pulled away and Carter opens her eyes, weakly
     looking around.

  O'NEILL
     You did it Sam...You won.

  CARTER
     (shaking her head, weak) It wasn't me.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, yes it was. You hung in there, you beat it.

  CARTER
     The Goa'uld gave its life for me. It saved me.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser and O'Neill look at each other as Carter
     rests her head once more.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel enters with a rather large assortment of
     flowers. He sits the flowers on the table, then
     walks to Carter's bedside and sits. She is lying
     on her side, staring off into space.

  DANIEL
     Hey Sam, how's it going tonight?

  ANNOTATION
     She doesn't answer.


LOCATION--HALLWAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel exits, finding O'Neill, Cassandra and
     Fraiser waiting for him. He crosses his arms.

  DANIEL
     She's still the same.

  CASSANDRA
     Janet said that the Goa'uld left after it died.

  DANIEL
     Well, that's right. Um, it died and her body's
     absorbing it. She's the same old Samantha Carter.
     Same person we've always known.

  O'NEILL
     (rubbing the girl's arm) Cassie, she's just a
     little sad right now. But I'll bet she cheers up
     when she sees you. (patting her arm) Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Cassandra enters the hospital room and walks to
     Carter's bedside. She turns, seeing O'Neill,
     Fraiser and Daniel watching from the doorway. She
     climbs onto the side of the bed and lightly
     touches Carter's shoulder.

  CASSANDRA
     Sam, it's me.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets no response. Cassie easily turns Carter
     over and she looks up with extremely tired and sad
     eyes. She looks on the verge of tears. Cassie
     smiles reassuringly.

  CASSANDRA
     You're going to be okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser smiles at O'Neill. Carter exhales sharply,
     closing her eyes for a moment before looking back
     up at the young girl.
