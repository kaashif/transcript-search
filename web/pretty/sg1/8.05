TEASER

LOCATION--A BEDROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The room is decorated in antique-style furniture
     with a large colored rug and old-fashioned
     wallpaper. Curtains are billowing in two windows.
     There is a woman sitting on the edge of a bed with
     her back to the camera.

  LEDA
     It's time.

  ANNOTATION
     Leda is sitting next to a man whose eyes and head
     are wrapped in bandages; it is Daniel. She has one
     hand behind his head and is starting to unravel
     the bandages with the other. Daniel touches her
     hand to stop her.

  DANIEL
     Wait.

  LEDA
     It's okay. Just relax.

  ANNOTATION
     She begins to unravel the bandages. Daniel's
     vision is blurry then becomes clearer. He has many
     small wounds on his face and around his neck, a
     sling on his left arm, and is shirtless. His
     glasses are gone.

  LEDA
     Give your vision a moment to adjust. You haven't
     used it for a while. How's that?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel struggles to open his eyes and keep them
     open.

  DANIEL
     Better.

  LEDA
     Your eyes. It's nice to finally see them.

  DANIEL
     Leda.

  LEDA
     Welcome back.

  DANIEL
     Where am I?

  LEDA
     Many miles from the city. This house belonged to
     my uncle. We're safe here.

  DANIEL
     The city. I remember being there. Something
     terrible happened. (remembering) Many people died.

  LEDA
     There's food if you feel strong enough to eat.

  DANIEL
     It's our fault, isn't it? None of this would have
     happened if we hadn't come here.

  LEDA
     You're alive, and considering what you've been
     through, that alone is a miracle.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks confused and horrified.


LOCATION--LANDSCAPE OF AN INDUSTRIAL CITY


LOCATION--A MUSEUM

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows the caption THREE MONTHS AGO. A
     guide is speaking to a group of tourists.

  GUIDE
     First discovered in the Curillian wastelands over
     one hundred and fifty years ago, and the highlight
     of our antiquities collection...the Great Ring of
     Avidan.

  ANNOTATION
     The camera moves up to a window, through which we
     see a Stargate in the courtyard outside. The guide
     leads the tourist outside.

  GUIDE
     Researchers estimate the ring to be at least
     several thousand years old. And, while its origin
     remains a subject of debate, many believe it was
     created by ancient worshippers to honor their
     gods. It's thought that the peculiar symbols on
     the Ring itself represent the names of the gods,
     however no one has been able to decipher--

  ANNOTATION
     He is cut off by the Stargate beginning to
     activate, the inner ring turning.

  GUIDE
     --exactly what they mean.

  ANNOTATION
     As the chevrons engage the people back away,
     gasping and murmuring. After the wormhole appears,
     one is hear to mutter, 'Is that part of the
     exhibit?' A MALP comes through the wormhole. A
     military man points a rifle at it.

  ANNOTATION
     The scene blends forward in time to show an
     official delegation waiting. Carter, Daniel, and
     Teal'c appear from the event horizon.

  CARTER
     Commander Gareth.

  GARETH
     In the name of the people of the Rand
     Protectorate, I welcome you. You're Colonel
     Carter?

  CARTER
     (nodding) This is Teal'c, and Doctor Daniel
     Jackson.

  GARETH
     It is a pleasure to finally meet you all face to
     face. But please come; we have many questions, as
     I'm sure you do as well.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin to walk.

  CARTER
     Sorry about scaring the tourists. We've made first
     contact with a lot of planets, but this is the
     first time we've found ourselves coming out of a
     museum piece.

  GARETH
     One of our artifacts suddenly coming to life was a
     little surprising, but that pales in comparison to
     its purpose. It is almost beyond imagining.

  KANE
     As is the fact that you're human.

  GARETH
     My chief aide: Jared Kane.

  DANIEL
     Well, believe it or not, there's actually a good
     reason for us being human.

  CARTER
     Which we'll get to in due time.

  GARETH
     Colonel, I hope that once we gain each other's
     trust, you'll be able to shed some light on the
     technology that powers the Great Ring. It is
     unlike anything we have seen before.

  CARTER
     We call it the Stargate, and our people share the
     same hope, Commander.

  GARETH
     Of course. In due time.

  DANIEL
     (gesturing toward the people wearing necklaces
     with ring-shaped pendants) I take it the Great
     Ring is a recurring motif in your culture.

  GARETH
     It is simply a reminder of certain traditions that
     pre-date our age of enlightenment. Most people
     wear them more for the sake of fashion than for
     religious belief.

  KANE
     Our history tells of an age when all powerful Gods
     ruled our world. The Great Ring was supposedly the
     source of their power.

  GARETH
     Of course, we know these are merely legends from
     our ancient past. However the activation of the
     Ring may well cause a stir amongst those few who
     still follow the old ways.


LOCATION--BEDROOM IN LEDA'S HOUSE, PRESENT TIME

  ANNOTATION
     Leda squeezes the water from a cloth and begins to
     wipe Daniel's brow, waking him.

  LEDA
     Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

  DANIEL
     (weakly) It's all right.

  ANNOTATION
     She opens a small medicine bottle and holds it to
     his lips.

  LEDA
     For the pain.

  ANNOTATION
     He drinks.

  LEDA
     I wish I could give you more, but our medicine is
     in short supply.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.

  LEDA
     I'll leave you alone.

  DANIEL
     (touching her arm) No. No, please -- stay.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows the caption TWO MONTHS AGO.
     Daniel is at a graphic showing the nations of the
     planet as O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c enter and
     sit down at the end of the briefing room table.

  O'NEILL
     How'd it go with the uh...

  DANIEL
     Caledonians? Not so well, actually. My time with
     their representatives was severely limited by the
     Rand security forces. Apparently Gareth had nation
     security concerns. Mainly that we'd tell the
     Caledonians too much about the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     Let me venture a wild guess. They don't get along
     so good.

  DANIEL
     The Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian
     Federation have been locked in a state of cold war
     for decades. Each nation has enough weapons to
     wipe each other off the face of the planet.

  CARTER
     Sounds depressingly familiar.

  DANIEL
     There's actually a third element which has me a
     little more concerned. Uh, a group of religious
     fundamentalists led by a man named Soren. Now
     these people think that all life on the planet was
     created by ancient gods, and that these gods will
     someday return and reward them for their faith.

  CARTER
     And, by coming through the Stargate, we confirmed
     their beliefs.

  DANIEL
     Because the 'Gate was activated in a public place,
     the Rand government has been unable to prevent the
     rumors from spreading. Now before we made contact
     with them, these people were considered zealots
     who took the ancient texts too literally. The
     'Gate being activated has given them all the need
     to prove that they were right all along. Their
     numbers will grow.

  O'NEILL
     (flippantly) That's terrible. And yet, not our
     problem.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel catches up to O'Neill as he walks down the
     corridor and they walk together.

  DANIEL
     Jack, you have to let me go back.

  O'NEILL
     If what you say is true, things are going to get a
     little out of hand over there.

  DANIEL
     Yes, because of us. If we hadn't chosen to pay
     them a little visit--

  O'NEILL
     They'd be far better off, I know. Daniel, we're
     always stickin' our collective noses where they
     don't belong. It's what we do.

  DANIEL
     I could help them understand what they're facing,
     make them see it's not the end of the world. If we
     leave now, who knows what could happen?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stops walking and they stand facing each
     other.

  DANIEL
     We have to help them. You know that.

  O'NEILL
     Regular contact, no exceptions. The second things
     start gettin' a little squirrelly--

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods and starts to walk away.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel! (wags a finger in warning) Squirrelly.

  DANIEL
     (nodding in understanding) Squirrelly.


LOCATION--LEDA'S HOUSE, AND A POND IN FRONT OF IT


LOCATION--BEDROOM IN LEDA'S HOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     Leda enters carrying a tray of food and drink to
     find Daniel standing at the window; he's wearing a
     grey tee-shirt under the sling.

  LEDA
     You shouldn't be standing.

  DANIEL
     Oh, don't let appearances fool you. I still feel
     terrible.

  ANNOTATION
     He leans on the dresser with his good arm as she
     sets the tray by the bed.

  DANIEL
     Leda, everything you've done for me, I w--

  LEDA
     Has been for my own sake as well as yours. So much
     has happened. Caring for you has helped me
     continue on.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, what has happened exactly? I mean, uh, I
     remember being in the bunker with Commander Gareth
     and then we were attacked, and the rest is a fog.

  LEDA
     Jared is away searching for survivors. He should
     be back in a few days' time. I think it would be
     best if he answered your questions.

  DANIEL
     Jared Kane. Yeah, I remember him. He was in the
     bunker as well.

  LEDA
     My husband was chief aide to Commander Gareth.

  DANIEL
     Husband. Was.

  LEDA
     He insisted I move here when the fighting reached
     the capital. He felt you would be safest in my
     care.

  DANIEL
     Yeah. Look, no offense, but I've really got to get
     back to my own world, or at least contact them and
     let them know that I'm okay, so uh...

  LEDA
     Trying to reach the Great Ring will be impossible.
     Rebel patrols have been sighted in the area. Even
     to leave the estate grounds would be dangerous.
     Not to mention the fact that you are far from
     healed. You must rest, Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Leda, what happened to Commander Gareth?


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c arrive through the 'Gate to find
     O'Neill waiting at the base of the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Give me good news, Colonel.

  CARTER
     I wish I could, sir. We met with Soren, leader of
     the rebels, but it was less constructive than we'd
     hoped.

  O'NEILL
     How much less?

  CARTER
     We were only allowed to see him for 15 minutes.

  TEAL'C
     After keeping us waiting for several hours.

  O'NEILL
     Well, important matters of state, no doubt.

  CARTER
     He's managed to unite all the fundamentalist
     factions in the Rand Protectorate, which
     effectively puts him in control.

  TEAL'C
     He was most unwilling to allow us a search for
     Daniel Jackson.

  CARTER
     Before he insisted we leave, he did promise he
     would look into the matter on our behalf. Whatever
     that means.

  O'NEILL
     Right. What about a UAV?

  CARTER
     He won't give us access to the surface. Plus, he
     claims it would interfere with their own radio
     communication systems. I'm sorry sir, but at this
     point, we have no way of knowing if Daniel's still
     alive.


LOCATION--RAND CITY, DAY


LOCATION--A BUNKER COMPLEX

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows the caption SIX WEEKS AGO. Daniel
     and Kane pass through a metal door.

  DANIEL
     And what does blue mean?

  KANE
     It's the second to highest level of military alert
     status. There's been civil unrest in several urban
     centers across the country. Over a dozen
     municipalities have fallen into the hands of
     Soren's troops. Our forces are in the process of
     pacifying those areas as we speak.

  DANIEL
     Pacifying?

  KANE
     Reclaiming our cities from the hands of religious
     madmen.

  DANIEL
     So civil unrest means you go to 'blue'.

  KANE
     Under normal circumstances, no. Unfortunately the
     situation has caused other problems.

  ANNOTATION
     They go through a two-part door into a command and
     control center, fully staffed and busy. The
     technology appears to be like Earth in the 1940's,
     though some of it is more modern.

  DANIEL
     What's going on?

  KANE
     We were forced to heighten our alert status to
     match that of the Caledonians.

  GARETH
     (into a communications system) And I promise you,
     we will share this technology with you once we
     fully understand it.

  TREYDAN
     (over a comm system) You mean once you've assessed
     its advantages to your national security. You've
     refused to allow our scientists access to the
     Great Ring. You've limited our access to the
     offworlders. We do not feel as much a part of this
     great discovery as you do.

  GARETH
     And had the Ring been activated on Caledonian
     soil, you would have done no differently. Minister
     Treydan, I am simply asking your Government for
     patience. Stand down your high alert. We will do
     the same.

  TREYDAN
     Typically, you trust your people too much
     Commander. Caledonia has been under strict martial
     law since news of the offworlders arrival began to
     spread. Our domestic security remains intact.

  GARETH
     The citizens of this world are not children. They
     just need time to come to terms with this
     information.

  TREYDAN
     Soren and his followers have already seized
     control of more than a dozen of your cities. Your
     people are panicked, and your country is on the
     verge of collapse. I urge you to deal with the
     situation in a swift and decisive manner. Should
     control of the Rand Protectorate fall into Soren's
     hands, we'll consider it an act of war.


LOCATION--LEDA'S ESTATE GROUNDS


LOCATION--A STORAGE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is speaking into an old-fashioned looking
     two-way radio and headphones. He's wearing a
     leather bomber-type jacket. His facial wounds have
     healed, and he's not wearing the sling, indicating
     more time has passed.

  DANIEL
     (working the radio dials) This is Daniel Jackson
     calling Stargate Command, come in please. This is
     Daniel Jackson calling Stargate Command, please
     respond. This is Daniel Jackson calling Stargate
     Command, come in please. This is Daniel Jackson
     calling Stargate Command, please respond.

  ANNOTATION
     There is unintelligible chatter coming from the
     radio. Leda opens the door and enters.

  LEDA
     Any luck?

  DANIEL
     No, nothing yet.

  LEDA
     You've been trying for days.

  DANIEL
     Something seems to be jamming all the signals I'm
     picking up. I mean, there's people out there, but
     nothing clear enough for me to respond to.

  LEDA
     But you think your friends will be able to hear
     you?

  DANIEL
     Uh, yeah, that's kind of a timing thing. You see,
     if the Stargate's open they'll be able to pick up
     my signal. If your 'Gate isn't buried in the
     rubble, or worse.

  LEDA
     Well, while you're waiting to be rescued, you
     could use some fresh air. If you think you're up
     to it.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes off his headphones and gets up to leave
     with her.


LOCATION--A PATH IN THE WOODS

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Leda are walking along a wide,
     tree-lined dirt path.

  LEDA
     How can you be sure that Soren and his followers
     aren't right? How can you know for certain that
     the Gods they worship aren't...

  DANIEL
     Benevolent? Because I've met more than a few of
     them. Trust me, they're the opposite. They're
     definitely not Gods.

  LEDA
     Then what are they?

  DANIEL
     Short form? They're a parasitical alien race that
     steals advanced technology and rules via fear and
     intimidation. Has a penchant for melodrama. Trust
     me, if Soren ever actually met one, he'd be
     singing a different tune.

  LEDA
     But you said you've fought them, and won?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, we got lucky a few times, that's all.

  LEDA
     There's hope, isn't there? You think what happened
     was your fault, don't you. From what you've told
     me, it was better that your people activated the
     Great Ring than the Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     You think so? 'Cause right now, I'm not so sure.

  LEDA
     You couldn't have known what was going to happen.
     When the fighting began, you could have gone back
     to your planet, but you chose to stay.

  DANIEL
     Yeah.

  LEDA
     To try and help us.

  DANIEL
     For all the good it did.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at the buildings and stop walking; she
     touches his arm.

  LEDA
     Daniel...there has been distrust between our
     country and Caledonia for generations. It was only
     a matter of time before something set it off. We
     did this to ourselves. And since you've come here,
     I've begun to think we may have a chance to undo
     it. To rebuild.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Technician Sgt. Harriman are sitting in
     the control room; the 'Gate is open.

  SGT HARRIMAN
     (into microphone) This is Stargate Command calling
     Doctor Jackson: do you read me?

  ANNOTATION
     Unintelligible voices are heard.

  CARTER
     Can you boost the signal?

  SGT HARRIMAN
     We're at maximum gain, Colonel. This is Stargate
     Command calling Daniel Jackson: do you copy?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters to stand behind them.

  O'NEILL
     Anything?

  CARTER
     Not yet, sir. We're picking up a lot of
     transmissions from the planet, but none of them
     are clear enough to tell if they're from Daniel.
     We think both sides may have employed radio
     jamming measures just prior to the attack.
     Meaning, any signals coming from outside the
     command bunker are a mess. We're working on it.

  O'NEILL
     Anything from SG-9 yet?

  CARTER
     Yeah, they just reported in. Sounds like the
     negotiations are going nowhere, Sir. Soren is
     still refusing to allow us to send any teams to
     look for Daniel. He said our presence on the
     planet would only cause more panic and fear.

  O'NEILL
     Well, okay. Sounds like I should meet these people
     myself.


LOCATION--LEDA'S ESTATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel comes outside through a door. A soldier
     comes up behind him, grabs him, and pushes him
     against a wall while holding a pistol on him. Kane
     and other soldiers come out of the woods. After a
     moment Daniel recognizes them (he doesn't have his
     glasses).

  DANIEL
     Kane.

  KANE
     Doctor Jackson.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM OF LEDA'S HOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     Kane, his soldiers, and Daniel are sitting at a
     wooden table eating soup and bread. Leda is
     serving them. The soldiers are now clean and in
     civilian clothes.

  KANE
     We got as close to what was left of the capital as
     we could. Soren has troops conducting full sweeps
     of the region, searching for survivors. Any
     suspected of remaining loyal to the old government
     are executed on the spot.

  LEDA
     Haven't enough people died?

  DANIEL
     I don't think that matters to him. It's about
     continuing the chaos, not peace.

  KANE
     You're right. The people are too afraid to fight
     back. Most of them have already given up hope.
     It's just a matter of time before they pledge
     their loyalty to Soren.

  DANIEL
     Kane, what the hell happened that night? I
     remember being in the bunker and then waking up
     here.

  KANE
     It was the end.


LOCATION--BUNKER COMMAND AND CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Flashback. Daniel enters through the revolving
     metal door and is immediately stopped by soldiers
     who grab his arms. Kane walks over to him.

  KANE
     I'm sorry Doctor Jackson, you really can't be in
     here right now.

  DANIEL
     Kane, what's going on? I heard something about the
     Stargate being moved.

  KANE
     Rebels have seized control of all of Rand's major
     cities, including sections of the capital itself.
     We had the Stargate moved into the bunker complex
     for security purposes.

  DANIEL
     What are the Caledonians doing?

  KANE
     Their missile systems are now fully deployed and
     primed. As a result, we've done the same. It might
     be best if you return to your planet now.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel watches; there is a lot of radio traffic
     indicating chaos in the situation.

  RADIO MAN
     Commander? Minister Treydan for you on a coded
     frequency.

  GARETH
     Put him through.

  TREYDAN
     (via the comm system) Commander Gareth, we've been
     monitoring the situation in your country. We are
     most concerned.

  GARETH
     I understand, Minister. However, rest assured we
     are close to reclaiming vital areas--

  TREYDAN
     Now is not the time for rhetoric, Commander. Our
     reports indicate large elements of your military
     are on the brink of mutiny. Your civil unrest has
     become a civil war. Should any of your weapons
     systems fall into the wrong hands, no one in my
     country would be safe.

  GARETH
     That will not happen, I can promise you.

  TREYDAN
     Just as you promised our scientists full access to
     the Stargate. First you hide information about the
     alien device, and now you deny your country has
     slipped into chaos.

  GARETH
     We respected the guidelines of our treaty to the
     letter. Our report to you on the Stargate outlined
     everything we know--

  ANNOTATION
     The Radio Man hands Kane a piece of paper as
     Treydan interrupts Gareth.

  TREYDAN
     Except what you deemed advantageous to your
     national security.

  GARETH
     One moment, Minister.

  ANNOTATION
     The Radio Man puts the radio into a nontransmit
     mode.

  KANE
     Rebel forces just detonated a large explosive
     device near one of our missile deployment
     facilities. As of this moment, we understand the
     facility to be compromised.

  ANNOTATION
     Gareth gestures to the Radio Man to turn the radio
     back on, and he does.

  GARETH
     Minister, forgive me; I must cut our conversation
     short.

  TREYDAN
     Commander, my intelligence advisors have just
     informed me of a massive explosion near one of
     your missile facilities. Is this true?

  GARETH
     We are still gathering information. We will
     contain the situation--

  TREYDAN
     The time for containment is long past, Commander.
     We cannot allow your missile facilities to fall
     into Soren's hands.

  GARETH
     Treydan, give us time. This need not escalate.

  TREYDAN
     We are targeting your missile sites only. If you
     do not wish a full-scale war, you will not
     retaliate.

  GARETH
     Treydan!

  RADIO MAN
     Commander, we've detected multiple launch signals
     from Caledonian positions.

  ANNOTATION
     An animated color map on the wall shows inbound
     missiles from Caledonia headed for missile
     installations in Rand. End flashback.


LOCATION--LEDA'S HOUSE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Kane are walking in front of the house.

  KANE
     It's possible the destruction could have been
     contained if Soren's forces hadn't gained control
     of one of our missile sites and launched a
     counter-attack on Caledonia. After that it
     devolved into a full-scale war. Within a matter of
     days, all our cities were levelled. From what we
     can tell, only a fraction of our population has
     survived, existing mainly in outlying areas. As
     for the Caledonians, I've heard rumors they're
     trying to rebuild what they can. It won't be much.
     They may have struck first, but our missile
     systems were much more accurate than theirs.

  DANIEL
     And Soren?

  KANE
     He used the chaos to make his move on the bunker.

  DANIEL
     Then how did you save me?

  KANE
     Actually, from what I understand, it was you who
     saved me.


LOCATION--COMMAND AND CONTROL BUNKER

  ANNOTATION
     Flashback. The wall map is showing a full-scale
     missile exchange. The bunker itself is being
     affected by the explosions, shaking and with
     plaster coming loose.

  DANIEL
     This is insane.

  KANE
     Soren's forces are moving in on this facility. I
     can get you to the Stargate, but we have to go
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Kane exit the control room through the
     double metal door. A military escort joins them.
     As they start to approach another door, it is
     blasted open from the other side. They take cover
     behind stacks of sandbags and pull out their
     pistols. Rebel forces start to stream in, and Kane
     and Daniel begin exchanging fire with them. The
     firing is fierce, and Kane gets shot in the leg.
     Daniel covers him with his firing and pulls him up
     and out of the way.

  KANE
     This way!

  ANNOTATION
     They run away down a side corridor.

  KANE
     Here, through that door.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel opens a metal door and they go through it
     and into some dark, dampened tunnels. Daniel is
     aiding Kane, who is barely able to walk. They
     finally make it outside into the chaos of the
     city. Kane realizes a bomb is incoming.

  KANE
     Get down!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel throws Kane to the ground next to the
     building then turns to hit the deck himself. The
     blast comes and dust and debris hit Daniel in the
     face, then obscure both of them. End flashback.


LOCATION--PATH NEAR LEDA'S ESTATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kane and Daniel are still walking.

  KANE
     Loyalist soldiers found us first and got us out of
     the city. Your wounds were much worse than mine.
     Bringing you here was the only option.

  DANIEL
     What happened to Commander Gareth?

  KANE
     He was executed shortly after the bunker fell.
     Since he took power, Soren has set up a
     provisional government. Not that there's much of
     Rand left to govern. However, we do know he does
     control whatever's left of the bunker complex.
     Including the Stargate. I'm sorry, Doctor Jackson.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Soren and two associates come through the open
     wormhole. O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c are waiting.

  O'NEILL
     Howdy fellas. (looks pointedly at his watch)
     Welcome to Earth.

  SOREN
     General O'Neill, it is an honor. I greet you in
     the name of our great nation, Avidan.

  CARTER
     You changed the name?

  SOREN
     Avidan speaks more to our people's beliefs.

  TEAL'C
     It is from an ancient Goa'uld dialect. It mean's
     'the Gods are just'.

  ANNOTATION
     Soren puts his hand over his heart and bows to
     Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Good choice.


LOCATION--LEDA'S HOUSE, DAY


LOCATION--PARLOUR IN LEDA'S HOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Kane are there.

  DANIEL
     So you're saying that Soren is still using the
     bunker as a command center.

  KANE
     Damage in the city would be too severe.

  DANIEL
     Then he still hasn't totally consolidated his
     power yet, has he. I'm saying that if we could
     somehow retake the bunker, we would effectively
     overthrow Soren.

  KANE
     The bunker's heavily fortified, and I have only a
     dozen men under my command. It would be suicide.

  DANIEL
     No, not if we had help. See, if I could reach my
     friends on Earth, we could regain control of the
     Gate.

  KANE
     If you could reach them. I know that you've been
     trying to make radio contact with your planet
     since you regained consciousness. Without success.
     I understand your wish to return to your world,
     but it simply isn't possible.

  DANIEL
     (a bit angry) This isn't about that--my people can
     help you.

  KANE
     Like you helped us before? I admire your passion
     Doctor Jackson, but too much has happened to fix
     with one heroic action. We have to accept the fact
     that Soren has won. Rand belongs to him now.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  SOREN
     It is obvious you revere the Great Ring as much as
     we do, General O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah, we love the old gal. Quite possibly for
     different reasons than you.

  SOREN
     We both seek to defend our people's way of life,
     do we not, General? To protect their very
     existence?

  TEAL'C
     You do not represent the people of your world. You
     merely kill those who believe differently and
     would stand against you.

  SOREN
     You speak what is on your mind. I admire that.

  O'NEILL
     Actually, in your case? He's holding back. Carter?

  CARTER
     Commander Soren, we're prepared to offer you aid
     in exchange for help in locating Daniel Jackson.
     Food and medical supplies, plus support personnel
     to help you stabilize the situation on your
     planet.

  SOREN
     (incredulous) You cannot truly believe that your
     friend is still alive?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, he's a resourceful fella.

  SOREN
     Your offer is most generous, but I'm afraid we
     must decline. We are however, particularly
     interested in your weapons technology.

  TEAL'C
     Your people are facing starvation and disease.

  SOREN
     What has happened to our world is most unfortunate
     and yet, vital. Those who refuse to believe needed
     to be purged from existence so that we could begin
     anew.

  O'NEILL
     You know, in these parts, we like to call that,
     'crimes against humanity'.

  CARTER
     If all you care about is spiritual salvation, what
     do you need the weapons for?

  SOREN
     The revolution is not yet complete.

  CARTER
     You mean you wanna take over Caledonia too.

  SOREN
     As I said, the revolution is not yet complete.


LOCATION--OUTSIDE LEDA'S ESTATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Leda is hanging sheets on a laundry line to dry.
     Daniel walks up to her.

  DANIEL
     Leda, you have to talk to your husband.

  LEDA
     What am I supposed to say to him?

  DANIEL
     Uh, that it's not to late. To regain control, to
     rebuild your country. Everything you told me
     before.

  LEDA
     Daniel, I can't.

  DANIEL
     Why?

  LEDA
     Because I'd be lying. Jared is right. Those of us
     who were unlucky enough to live through what's
     happened will die soon enough, either through
     disease or one of Soren's purges. There is no
     future.

  DANIEL
     Leda, you were right. There is hope. Don't, don't
     doubt that, please.

  LEDA
     You believe your people can help us?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  LEDA
     And what if you do overthrow Soren, what then? You
     simply leave? (pauses as Daniel realizes what she
     is saying) When Jared became part of Commander
     Gareth's inner circle, he changed: became remote,
     distant. I'd forgotten what it was like just to
     talk to someone. To feel.

  DANIEL
     Leda--

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches up to touch her face but she shies
     away, and he pulls his hand back.

  LEDA
     I'll speak to him, Daniel. But he won't hear me.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks away with the empty laundry basket.


LOCATION--SGC, GENERAL O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters followed by Carter and Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Waste of time. Waste.

  CARTER
     Sir, I think the fact that he hasn't left yet
     could mean that he's still willing to deal.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c sits down opposite O'Neill's chair, then
     O'Neill gestures that he should sit.

  TEAL'C
     He has no need for humanitarian aid. The chaos in
     his country has only served to strengthen his
     position.

  CARTER
     Well, we can't just give up.

  O'NEILL
     (aggravated) Yes, I know that.

  CARTER
     We're continuing to monitor countless radio
     signals coming from the planet. One of them could
     be from Daniel. If we can find a way to contact
     him--

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts his face in his hands, then looks up
     suddenly.

  O'NEILL
     (angrily, with a raised voice) Find it!

  CARTER
     (subdued) Yes, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c leave as O'Neill sighs,
     frustrated.


LOCATION--LEDA'S HOUSE, EVENING

  KANE
     I'm telling you Leda, it's madness. All it will
     accomplish is to wipe out any chance we have to
     mount a unified resistance in the future.

  LEDA
     But what if he's right? What if this is our best
     opportunity to defeat Soren?

  KANE
     (upset) You would have me throw away my life, and
     the lives of my men, so that Daniel can return to
     his world?

  LEDA
     It's not about that. It's about rebuilding our
     world. His friends can help us do that. Jared, our
     people need this.

  KANE
     You mean, he needs this. I'm not blind Leda. I
     know that you and Daniel have grown close during
     his convalescence.

  LEDA
     Jared, it's not what you think.

  KANE
     Let me speak. If I could live the last few years
     differently, Leda, I would. I would make the time.
     But we no longer have the luxury for regrets. I
     need to know, do you love him? Leda.

  LEDA
     I trust him.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Soren is standing while O'Neill and Teal'c listen
     from their seats.

  SOREN
     Once order has been established, the people of
     Avidan will differently than before. Simply,
     humbly. Waiting for our Gods' inevitable return.

  O'NEILL
     You know, we've met these gods upon whom you're so
     hot, and trust me when I tell you, they're not
     what you think they are.

  TEAL'C
     They will reward your worship with enslavement.

  SOREN
     You are not the first to try to sway our beliefs.
     But I can assure you, our faith is unshakable.

  TEAL'C
     This is not about faith. This is about a means to
     power.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole is open. Soren enters with his
     followers, escorted by SF's. O'Neill and Teal'c
     are waiting at the base of the ramp. Soren and his
     followers go through the 'Gate without a word. The
     wormhole stays open.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c, sarcastically) That went well.

  CARTER
     (from the control room) Sir, you better get up
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c go up the stairs to join
     Carter.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  CARTER
     Well, by implementing new spread-spectrum
     frequency hopping into our communications
     software--

  O'NEILL
     (waving his hands) Carter, Carter, Carter!

  DANIEL
     (via the radio) Hellooo. Guys?

  CARTER
     (smiling) We found him.

  O'NEILL
     Sweet. (into microphone) Daniel?

  DANIEL
     Jack? Nice to hear your voice.

  O'NEILL
     Likewise. You comin' home, or what?

  DANIEL
     Trying to. As soon as I find my kel'tesh.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DANIEL
     Uuhhh, looks a lot like my rin'kal'noc. You know I
     like it between the, for the gel'kral'kree'nor
     day.

  O'NEILL
     (confused, to Carter and Teal'c) He's changed.

  CARTER
     Sir, he's speaking Goa'uld.

  TEAL'C
     Rin'kal'noc means strategy. Kel'tesh speaks of a
     well-known Jaffa battle tactic. A flanking attack
     from two sides.

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) Yes, Daniel, I remember exactly
     where I put it. Any other thoughts?

  DANIEL
     No, just that I hope someone's been feeding my
     lo'a'sac while I've been away.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gives O'Neill a briefing in a folder marked
     Top Secret; Teal'c is there.

  CARTER
     We've pieced together all the Goa'uld words Daniel
     gave us. If Teal'c's translations are correct,
     he's suggesting a strategy to retake the bunker.

  TEAL'C
     He is proposing a coordinated attack against
     Soren.

  CARTER
     We come through the 'Gate at the same time as
     Daniel and Kane's men enter from the surface. I'm
     thinking we take SG's 3, 6, and 12 as back-up. We
     go in hot, secure the 'Gate, then extract Daniel.

  TEAL'C
     He has supplied an estimate of the strength of
     Soren's forces as well as a possible date and time
     for the assault.

  CARTER
     Our next communication is in five hours. All we
     need to do is confirm everything, and of course
     get a 'go' from you, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     All right, well, not to nitpick or anything here,
     T, but are you sure you got it right?

  TEAL'C
     I am certain, O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Okay. Go.


LOCATION--PARLOUR IN LEDA'S HOUSE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kane and Daniel are talking.

  KANE
     Fifteen men? That's hardly enough.

  DANIEL
     Look, these are some of the best people on my
     planet. And they're trained for missions exactly
     like this. It'll be enough--trust me. But if we're
     going to do this, we have to set it up now.
     They're waiting for your response.

  ANNOTATION
     Leda comes rushing in from outside, upset.

  LEDA
     Jared, a rebel patrol is approaching. Hide in the
     cellar.

  ANNOTATION
     Men are running past the windows.

  KANE
     (reluctant) Leda--

  LEDA
     I know what to do.

  ANNOTATION
     They grab their jackets and along with Jared's
     other men, rush down the stairs to a cellar. From
     the kitchen, Leda pushes some shelving over the
     door in the floor.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     (from outside) In the name of Soren, open the
     door!

  ANNOTATION
     The rebel soldiers enter through the kitchen door,
     armed, and begin spreading through the house.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     Inspection. Stand aside.

  LEDA
     Please, just tell me what you're looking for.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     Who owns this house?

  LEDA
     I do.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     And who else lives here?

  LEDA
     No one!

  ANNOTATION
     The soldier grabs her wrist and forces her to her
     knees. She gasps in pain and is on the verge of
     crying.

  LEDA
     You're hurting me!

  ANNOTATION
     Below, Daniel hears her cry and moves to go up the
     stairs. Jared stops him. They stop to listen to
     what is being said.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     We know loyalist soldiers are in the area.
     Collaboration is punishable by death. (to his
     soldiers) Search the house!

  ANNOTATION
     Some time passes.

  SOLDIER
     There's no one else here, but we found some mens'
     clothes and boots.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     Now who else lives here?

  LEDA
     (crying as the soldier is still holding her arm)
     My husband did. He died last month from wounds
     suffered during the bombings. Please, I only wish
     to lead a simple life as it is written in the
     ancient texts.

  ANNOTATION
     The soldier releases her roughly.

  REBEL SOLDIER
     There's nothing here. Let's move.

  ANNOTATION
     The rebel soldiers leave.


LOCATION--YARD OF LEDA'S ESTATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The loyalist soldiers are in their uniforms again.
     Jared is standing in front of them.

  KANE
     Once we're close enough, we'll use the city's
     tunnel systems to get us near one of the bunker's
     access points. After we're inside, we'll wait for
     Doctor Jackson's people to make their move, then
     we make ours. Understood?

  ANNOTATION
     He walks over to where Daniel is waiting.

  KANE
     Let's hope your friends keep their end of the
     bargain.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks up to his wife. She is crying quietly. He
     smiles briefly and takes her hand for a moment,
     then walks away. Daniel walks up to her.

  DANIEL
     If this works...

  LEDA
     You'll be going home.

  DANIEL
     Leda, I--

  LEDA
     No. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel smiles, nods, and leaves; she watches after
     him and the other men.


LOCATION--CAPITAL CITY, NOW MOSTLY IN RUINS, DAY


LOCATION--CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and the others are running through the
     tunnels, rifles in hand.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The SG teams run up the ramp, ready to go through
     the 'Gate.


LOCATION--ENTRANCE TO BUNKER SYSTEM

  ANNOTATION
     Jared leads the men into the bunker complex from
     the tunnels.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter pull pins from tear gas grenades
     and throw them through the wormhole.


LOCATION--BUNKER CONTROL CENTER

  ANNOTATION
     Soren and his people occupy the center.

  REBEL AIDE
     (to Soren) Commander, several posts are no longer
     reporting in. Loyalist troops have entered from
     the surface and have managed to take several key
     sections.

  SOREN
     Then take them back.

  REBEL AIDE
     We cannot. They have coordinated their attack with
     help from the offworlders. We are losing control
     of the facility.

  SOREN
     If you're suggesting that we evacuate, think
     again.


LOCATION--BUNKER COMPLEX INTERSECTION

  ANNOTATION
     The loyalist soldiers are exchanging fire with the
     rebel soldiers. Carter and Teal'c toss grenades,
     and the SGC soldiers fire as well. Daniel shoots
     several rebels. The rebels fall one after another.

  KANE
     Cease fire!

  CARTER
     (shouting) Daniel, you guys okay?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, we're fine!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and SGC soldiers come out from behind
     cover, meeting Kane and his men. It is now quiet.


LOCATION--BUNKER CONTROL CENTER

  REBEL AIDE
     All stations are dark. The loyalists have us
     surrounded. They are calling for our surrender.

  SOREN
     Engage them.


LOCATION--BUNKER SECTION OUTSIDE COMMAND CENTER

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is leading the SGC teams. Daniel is with
     them now. She gives hand signals for the SG teams
     to move out and they do. She does the same for the
     loyalist soldiers. They take up positions around
     the main metal door that is the entrance to the
     command center.

  CARTER
     (to Kane) Any chance he'll just surrender?

  ANNOTATION
     Kane just looks at her.


LOCATION--BUNKER CONTROL CENTER

  REBEL AIDE
     Commander, we are hopelessly outnumbered.

  ANNOTATION
     Soren pulls out a pistol and shoots her. The other
     rebel followers are shocked and begin to gather
     behind him; they are all armed.

  SOREN
     We are all here for one purpose. To honor the will
     of our Gods. In their names, we rose up. In their
     names, we purged the nonbelievers. And in their
     names, we will die if necessary. We will not
     dishonor them with cowardice. Now engage them.

  ANNOTATION
     The followers look uncertain and don't move.

  SOREN
     Engage them! You question your faith? I will show
     you faith.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs a rifle from one of the rebels and goes
     out through the metal door to meet the SGC and
     loyalist team alone.


LOCATION--BUNKER SECTION OUTSIDE COMMAND CENTER

  CARTER
     (pointing her P-90 at Soren) Drop your weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     Soren raises his arms from his sides but doesn't
     drop the rifle.

  CARTER
     I said drop your weapon, now!

  ANNOTATION
     Kane steps forward and shoots Soren dead. He walks
     up to the body and is joined by Daniel.

  KANE
     It's over.

  DANIEL
     I hope so. You may have just made a martyr.

  KANE
     I had no choice. You can return to your world now.

  DANIEL
     Kane--

  KANE
     What happened to us was not your fault.

  DANIEL
     I know. We made a promise, and we intend to keep
     it. We'll be back to help you rebuild.

  ANNOTATION
     Kane nods and leaves with his men, presumably to
     take the control room. Carter walks over to
     Daniel.

  CARTER
     (gently) Daniel, are you ready to go home?

  DANIEL
     (subdued) Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     They join Teal'c and walk slowly away.
