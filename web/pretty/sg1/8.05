<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>GARETH: It is simply a reminder of certain traditions that pre-date our age of enlightenment. Most people wear them more for the sake of fashion than for religious belief.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>KANE: Our history tells of an age when all powerful Gods ruled our world. The Great Ring was supposedly the source of their power.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>DANIEL: There's actually a third element which has me a little more concerned. Uh, a group of religious fundamentalists led by a man named Soren. Now these people think that all life on the planet was created by ancient gods, and that these gods will someday return and reward them for their faith.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>CARTER: And, by coming through the Stargate, we confirmed their beliefs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>DANIEL: Because the 'Gate was activated in a public place, the Rand government has been unable to prevent the rumors from spreading. Now before we made contact with them, these people were considered zealots who took the ancient texts too literally. The 'Gate being activated has given them all the need to prove that they were right all along. Their numbers will grow.</td></tr>
