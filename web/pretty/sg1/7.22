Lost City Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel are in Daniel's office. O'Neill
     is doing a crossword puzzle and looks exhausted.
     Daniel is reading in the background, scribbling in
     a book, he gets up and shows something in the book
     to O'Neill.

  DANIEL
     Does this mean anything to you?

  O'NEILL
     Nope.

  DANIEL
     Could you at least look at it?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, I don't speak Ancient...yet. And when I
     do, eventually, you know I'll never understand it.

  DANIEL
     You have to try.

  O'NEILL
     Look last time things just popped into my fron.

  DANIEL
     Fron is head?

  O'NEILL
     Now, see, I have no idea what you're talking
     about.

  DANIEL
     Well maybe if you stop working on the stupid
     cross...

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs for the crossword and tries to take it
     away from O'Neill, who tries to get it back.

  O'NEILL
     Hey, hey....I'd like to at least finish that while
     I can.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters the office and goes to stand behind
     Daniel.

  CARTER
     I thought you were supposed to be...

  DANIEL
     Thirteen across you wrote "taonas".

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. So? What's'at mean?

  DANIEL
     Ah...I don't know, you tell me. Eight down you
     wrote "praclarush".

  CARTER
     What's eight down?

  DANIEL
     Um...label. With those empty spaces I think the
     answer is supposed to be identification. Thirteen
     across is sphere. Jack, this is it.

  O'NEILL
     Now, see I assume we still speak the same
     language...mostly.

  ANNOTATION
     He leans back in his chair putting his hands
     behind his head.

  DANIEL
     Sphere...planet. Label...name.

  O'NEILL
     (overly dramatic voice and looking disbelieving)
     Following...still...you...not!

  DANIEL
     Praclarush taonas. I...I think you wrote the name
     of the planet we will find the Lost City in the
     crossword.

  O'NEILL
     (pauses and looks questioningly at Daniel) Bit of
     a jump?

  DANIEL
     Why else would you do that?

  CARTER
     The clue for seven down is "celestial body" and he
     wrote Uma Thurman.

  O'NEILL
     (smiling) Yes.

  DANIEL
     (looking from O'Neill to Carter and back) It has
     to mean something.

  O'NEILL
     It does! (grabs back the crossword, looks at it
     and lets out a puff of air) I'm hungry!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the office taking the crossword
     along. Daniel and Carter look at each other with a
     hint of rolling their eyes at O'Neills behaviour.


LOCATION--SGC COMMISSARY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Daniel and Carter sit at a table in a
     corner of the commissary. Daniel has his back to
     the corner.

  DANIEL
     Praclarush taonas. According to this it means lost
     in fire. It was lost. This has to be the planet
     where... where the Lost City is.

  CARTER
     Well, even if it is, knowing the name of the
     planet doesn't really help, unless we have a Gate
     address to get us there.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill tears off the badge with Earth's symbol
     from Daniel's left arm and turns it so the symbol
     lies in front of Daniel with the tip pointing away
     from him. The three of them look at each other
     with a look of disbelief at the thought of the
     significance of this in their eyes.

  DANIEL
     Jack, what are you doing?

  O'NEILL
     Ad.

  CARTER
     What?

  O'NEILL
     Ad!

  DANIEL
     This?

  O'NEILL
     That!

  DANIEL
     That is Ad?

  O'NEILL
     You can stop...that. And don't ask me what it
     means, I don't know.

  DANIEL
     I think I do.

  ANNOTATION
     He picks up his notebook and draws the orion
     symbol (a figure of two triangles with their tips
     towards each other) while Carter looks on
     interestedly, then he shows it to O'Neill.

  DANIEL
     What's this?

  O'NEILL
     Sh.

  ANNOTATION
     They look at each other questioningly.

  O'NEILL
     Well?

  CARTER
     You just told us to be quiet.

  O'NEILL
     No. When I look at this, I think "sh".

  DANIEL
     That's it.

  CARTER
     What?

  DANIEL
     Pra-Cla-Ru-Sh-Tao-Nas. Six syllables....What if
     each symbol on the Stargate has a corresponding
     sound so they can be spoken aloud?

  CARTER
     Like an alphabet.

  DANIEL
     Praclarush taonas isn't just the name of the
     planet, it's also the gate address.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel has his notebook open; there are six gate
     address symbols on the page. He adds Earth's
     symbol while explaining.

  DANIEL
     (to Doctor Weir) Ad is the earth symbol. Our point
     of origin. Praclarush taonas ad.

  WEIR
     So this is the gate address that would lead us to
     the Lost City.

  DANIEL
     It has to be.

  CARTER
     (sitting at the computer with address logs and
     looking up to the others) Wait a minute. We dialed
     this same address over two years ago, but we
     couldn't establish a wormhole. The gate must be
     buried.

  DANIEL
     Lost in fire.

  CARTER
     What we're looking for could still be there.
     (turns back to the computer) I could use the
     address to calculate the planet's location in
     space, but we'll need a ship to get there.

  DANIEL
     Prometheus.

  WEIR
     But with Anubis on his way Prometheus is our last
     line of defense.

  CARTER
     Maybe Teal'c has something by now.

  WEIR
     Where's Col. O'Neill?

  DANIEL
     (looking slightly uncomfortable but trying to look
     innocent) Packing.


LOCATION--SGC, LAB

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is grabbing things off shelves in what
     looks like a cross between a lab, storage and a
     corridor with a MALP parked right next to one
     door. Weir, Daniel and Carter enter at the same
     time as Weir addresses O'Neill.

  WEIR
     Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Don't ask!

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off along the corridor the others
     following him.

  CARTER
     The last time this happened he just started doing
     things without knowing why.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts down the things he picked up below
     what looks like a UAV and starts heading down
     another part of the room.

  DANIEL
     It's a good sign though, hopefully it means we're
     on the right track.

  CARTER
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is standing in front of a shelf with
     numerous yellow boxes and pulls one out.

  O'NEILL
     I don't know, Carter. (puts the box down with the
     other stuff) Grab a naquadah generator, will ya?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the room, Weir looks worried,
     Daniel smiles a kind of pasted on smile at her


LOCATION--CHULAK, TENT CAMP, NIGHT


LOCATION--ONE OF THE TENTS, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     A guard holding a staff weapon holds open the tent
     flap to allow a Jaffa to enter. Teal'c and Bra'tac
     sit side by side at a fire. The newcomer bows and
     introduces himself.

  RONAN
     I am Ronan.

  BRA'TAC
     I knew your father.

  RONAN
     It is an honor.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac signs the newcomer to come closer. Ronan
     steps forward.

  RONAN
     I have a ship at my disposal.

  TEAL'C
     So we have heard.

  RONAN
     Forgive me, but...as brave as you are you cannot
     possibly hope to stop the fleet of Anubis with
     just one ship. I have seen the extent of his
     forces.

  BRA'TAC
     We only wish to use your ship to help us find
     something much more powerful.

  TEAL'C
     Something that we believe would defeat Anubis once
     and for all.

  RONAN
     If that is true then I will join you... That is my
     only condition... I am a fine pilot.

  TEAL'C
     (smiling very slightly) So we have heard.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     There is an open transport crate filled with
     assorted bits and pieces of what looks to be
     electronics, cables and the like. It is being
     closed by a technician and Weir steps up to it,
     standing right beside it. She turns around towards
     SG-1, which is entering the room and carrying more
     equipment, adressing them.

  WEIR
     Well, have you got everything you need? I think
     there's still a sink in the kitchen.

  O'NEILL
     Is that a joke?

  WEIR
     Perhaps. A bad one.

  O'NEILL
     Yes. Very bad. But I sense hope for you.

  ANNOTATION
     In the background more technicians add more
     equipment crates.

  WEIR
     Well, I hope for all of us that you find what
     you're looking for, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns aside and heads up the ramp to head
     through the Gate, Carter and Daniel following and
     some of the techs carrying equipment crates after
     them


LOCATION--RONAN'S SHIP IN HYPERSPACE TRANSFER


LOCATION--RONAN'S SHIP, CARGO AREA

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel are sitting in the compartment,
     Daniel on top of a crate scribbling in his
     notebook, O'Neill leaning back against a large
     yellowish crate. Daniel looks up from his book
     towards O'Neill and starts twirling his pen.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DANIEL
     I wouldn't have done it, you know?

  O'NEILL
     I know.

  DANIEL
     I mean, there has to be a way to reverse the
     effects. Once we have what we need. We'll find a
     way.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks down. Carter enters the room.

  CARTER
     Coaxing anything we can out of the engines but
     we're still two days away. How are you feeling,
     Sir?

  O'NEILL
     (looking uncomfortable) A bit cruvis. A little
     fron-ache.

  ANNOTATION
     At hearing the words Carter and Daniel look
     slightly alarmed. O'Neill, after realizing he
     spoke Ancient, gets up.

  O'NEILL
     We need to go faster.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves the room, Carter and Daniel looking
     after him, a bit flustered.


LOCATION--SPACE, VIEW OF EARTH FROM BESIDE THE MOON

  ANNOTATION
     A mothership comes into view followed by a smaller
     ship and another mothership.


LOCATION--THE WHITE HOUSE, DAY


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is already there, General Jumper and a
     woman, the National Security Advisor enter. The
     General addresses the President, a guard stands in
     the background.

  JUMPER
     Mister President, a short time ago our space based
     radar detected three Goa'uld vessels emerging from
     hyperspace.

  ANNOTATION
     President Hayes is sitting on a couch, addressing
     what turns out to be Kinsey.

  HAYES
     Looks like you were wrong, Bob.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey is sitting on a similar couch opposite the
     President, General Maynard beside him.

  KINSEY
     Three goa'uld ships is hardly the full force of
     Anubis' fleet.

  HAMMOND
     (looking towards the President) Sounds to me like
     Anubis wants to know if SG-1 was successful in
     procuring Ancient defense technology.

  KINSEY
     They weren't.

  HAMMOND
     Not yet, but Anubis doesn't know that.

  HAYES
     And he's most likely holding back his main
     invasion fleet 'til he finds out what we've got.

  JUMPER
     Sir, Prometheus and our fleet of 302's can give
     them a run for their money.

  HAMMOND
     If that's all he throws at us, yes sir, I agree.

  KINSEY
     Let's do it.

  HAMMOND
     However Mr. President, I agree with your
     assessment of the situation. Anubis' objective is
     to goad us into a precipitous action, which will
     show our hand. I believe launching the Prometheus
     now would only serve to demonstrate we lack the
     advanced weaponry Anubis is afraid of.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey looks like he wants to say something,
     moving his lips but no sound leaving them.

  HAYES
     Remain at DEFCON 3 for the time being but contact
     the governments of Russia, Great Britain, France,
     China and Canada. And let them know what we think
     we're in for. In the meantime, I better prepare a
     hell of a speech. (starts getting up) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard opens the door Hammond, General Jumper
     and the National Security Advisor leave the room.


LOCATION--RONAN'S SHIP, ENGINE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pushes a violet crystal into a panel, then
     gets up and Carter joins him at the panel.

  O'NEILL
     Give me your zat.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter goes to do that and hands the gun to
     O'Neill who fires it once at the array of
     crystals, which causes the hum of the engine to
     rise in pitch. O'Neill hands the zat back to
     Carter.

  O'NEILL
     There you go.

  CARTER
     Sir, I think you should know that General Hammond
     authorized me to take command of the team if I
     determined it ...

  O'NEILL
     Do it now.

  CARTER
     Sir, I don't think that's necessary yet.

  O'NEILL
     I trust you...I'll make it easy for you...I
     resign. You're in charge.

  CARTER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill goes back to manipulating the crystals.

  CARTER
     Sir, at your house before Daniel and Teal'c showed
     up, what I was gonna say was...

  O'NEILL
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     They stand there looking at each other over the
     open panel until O'Neill pushes it back in.


LOCATION--SHIP IN HYPERSPACE TRANSFER


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP


LOCATION--HALLWAY ON MOTHERSHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Anubis' First Prime walks down a hallway, then
     enters through a doorway flanked by Super Soldiers
     and adresses Anubis who is standing at a window
     looking out.

  HER'AK
     My lord, the advance attack reports that they have
     received no challenge.

  ANNOTATION
     Anubis starts turning from the window towards his
     First Prime.

  ANUBIS
     Order them to begin the attack. If the Tau'ri have
     weapons of the Ancients we shall see.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak bows and leaves.


LOCATION--SHIP EMERGING FROM HYPERSPACE

  ANNOTATION
     It is moving towards a planet with a dark, reddish
     surface.


LOCATION--RONAN'S SHIP, COCKPIT

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter enter, O'Neill moves aside,
     Carter continues to the front of the room and
     stops behind the pilots, one of whom is Bra'tac.
     Daniel steps up to her from behind.

  CARTER
     Oh this doesn't look good, the surface is almost
     completely covered by lava flows.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is visible behind Carter.

  DANIEL
     How could there have ever been a civilization down
     there?

  CARTER
     A star becomes a red giant like this near the end
     of his life. A million years ago this planet may
     have looked very much like Earth.

  DANIEL
     So we're a million years late?

  CARTER
     Probably more.

  DANIEL
     That's very late.

  ANNOTATION
     They both turn around looking inquiringly at
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks like she wants to say something but
     decides not to.


LOCATION--SHIP FLYING OVER THE LAVASTREAMS


LOCATION--COCKPIT

  BRA'TAC
     I have scanned the entire surface.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel look back at O'Neill looking
     slightly annoyed.

  O'NEILL
     What do you want me to say? I don't even know why
     we're here.

  CARTER
     But you did pack the Haz-Mat suits for us. My
     guess is you knew the condition of the planet and
     you knew that we would have to go down there.

  O'NEILL
     Then you know more than I do.

  CARTER
     No, Sir, I don't. Sit down and take a look.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks a bit perplexed and doesn't do what
     she says right away.

  CARTER
     That's an order.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill draws up his eyebrows, Teal'c does the
     same, Carter looks astounded at what she did, but
     decides that she is in command now after all and
     stands firm. Bra'tac gets up so O'Neill can sit
     down.

  O'NEILL
     (while passing Carter) Easy!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sits down, Carter moves close behind his
     chair. He opens a holoscreen, marking a spot on
     the planets surface.

  O'NEILL
     Taonas.

  CARTER
     Sir?

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DANIEL
     You looked at the screen and said "taonas".

  O'NEILL
     If you say so.

  DANIEL
     You say so.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting in the pilot's chair, the
     holoscreen open showing the marking, Carter behind
     O'Neill, Daniel at the other pilot's chair and
     Teal'c and Bra'tac behind them. The view on the
     holoscreen changes as the ship moves then zooms in
     on one thing in particular.

  CARTER
     There's a small anomaly on the surface here. Like
     a bubble.

  BRA'TAC
     Is it a cavern?

  CARTER
     It looks like a perfectly formed half sphere of
     molten rock.

  RONAN
     Perhaps a forcefield meant to protect a city was
     covered over.

  CARTER
     To small to have a city in there. And we aren't
     getting any energy readings from it.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps the shield has since failed.

  CARTER
     We should still check it out.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns and starts leaving the room.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     General Maynard holds the receiver of the red
     phone, clearly having just finished speaking.

  MAYNARD
     Mister President, we managed to contact the
     Captain of the Sprewitt, a destroyer in the Nimitz
     battlegroup.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts down receiver and activates loudspeaker.

  VOICE FROM THE LOUDSPEAKER
     I repeat some sort of beam just came out of the
     sky, there wasn't any warning but the entire
     carrier just went up in one big fireball.

  HAYES
     Captain can you see the enemy?

  VOICE FROM THE LOUDSPEAKER
     Holy...another cruiser just blew up. Where the
     hell is the fire coming from? All ahead...(static)

  ANNOTATION
     General Maynard picks up the receiver and listens
     into it, then puts it down and glances at his
     watch.

  MAYNARD
     The engagement began less than five minutes ago
     and there was only one Goa'uld ship.


LOCATION--SURFACE OF THE VOLCANIC PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Ronan's ship flies close to the surface then
     starts to land at a slightly raised point of it.


LOCATION--CARGO AREA OF RONAN'S SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c are finishing putting on
     Haz-Mat-suits in the foreground, Carter half
     hidden behind Daniel, while O'Neill (already
     wearing his) looks on with Ronan. Ronan moves past
     SG-1 towards the cockpit, where Bra'tac is in the
     pilot's seat looking at the holoscreen.

  BRA'TAC
     Here. The crust may be thin enough for the rings
     to penetrate. Stand by!

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 moves into the ring area putting on their
     helmets. Rings are activated and they are
     transported to below the surface.

  RONAN
     Can you still hear us?

  TEAL'C
     (via loudspeaker) Indeed. Loudly and clearly.

  BRA'TAC
     We will move a safe distance and return on your
     signal.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 move through the underground area
     communicating via their suit-radios.

  CARTER
     The radiation level is pretty high.

  TEAL'C
     I believe Ronan was correct. It seems a shield
     once protected this structure.

  CARTER
     It's possible the rings compromised the dome's
     integrity we shouldn't stay too long.

  DANIEL
     Too bad. Otherwise it's very pleasant.

  ANNOTATION
     After moving through the dome for a while dodging
     what looks like stalagmites, they arrive at a
     chamber.

  DANIEL
     Architecture definitely indicates this was built
     by the Ancients.

  TEAL'C
     This facility does not appear operational.

  CARTER
     I don't know about you guys but right now I'm
     kinda hoping this isn't the Lost City.

  ANNOTATION
     One of them is moving towards a raised area with a
     throne. It turns out to be O'Neill when Carter
     addresses him.

  CARTER
     Sir, be careful.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sits down on the throne which causes it to
     start glowing blue and a light shining on the area
     around the throne.

  DANIEL
     Jack, you sure you know what you're doing?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts his left hand on the armrest and
     looks up, a forcefield activates and he takes off
     his helmet.

  CARTER
     (looks at a device in her hand) The atmosphere is
     safe.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pushes a crystal-like gelatinous substance
     in the tip of the armrest. The throne swivels
     back, a footrest raising while the back of the
     chair moves. The rest of SG-1 take off their
     helmets. O'Neill pushes the gel again and a
     holographic projection appears overhead.

  CARTER
     It's a map of the galaxy.

  DANIEL
     Looks like every planet the Ancients ever
     colonized is indicated here. (points to one of the
     light points in the hologram) This is were we are.
     Praclarush.

  ANNOTATION
     The view of the projection changes to show a solar
     system.

  CARTER
     That's our solar system.

  ANNOTATION
     The projections zooms in on a planet looking much
     like Earth.

  CARTER
     Earth?

  TEAL'C
     That does not appear to be Earth.

  DANIEL
     That's because it doesn't take into consideration
     30 million years of continental drift.

  CARTER
     (looks away from the projection to O'Neill) Sir,
     why are you showing us this?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill doesn't answer.

  DANIEL
     Jack?

  O'NEILL
     Terra...Atlantus.

  DANIEL
     Terra is Earth. Atlantis.

  CARTER
     The Lost City of Atlantis?

  DANIEL
     (points to the projection on which the continents
     are moving) Are you saying the Lost City of the
     Ancients is here?

  CARTER
     Antarctica.

  O'NEILL
     Subo glacius.

  DANIEL
     Under the ice?...The city we've been looking for
     is under the ice of Antarctica.

  CARTER
     It's been on Earth the whole time?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks from one to the other but doesn't
     speak.

  DANIEL
     Jack we were just there.

  CARTER
     So...we came all this way just to find out that we
     have to go all the way back.

  O'NEILL
     No.

  RONAN
     You are the betrayer of your one true god Anubis.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls out the knife and sends Bra'tac to his
     knees.

  BRA'TAC
     (breathing heavily and putting his hands over the
     wound) You should have struck for my heart, Ronan.

  RONAN
     (smiling) You will die more slowly this way.

  BRA'TAC
     You are mistaken. I no longer carry a symbiote.

     Ronan...was an agent of...Anubis.

  TEAL'C
     (looking saddened and concerned, whispering) Save
     your strength, old friend.

     battle I fear I cannot win.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel look on, then O'Neill moves
     forward and around the two. He kneels down and
     looks at Bra'tac intently, then puts his left hand
     on the wound, concentrating. Something appears to
     happen that heals the wound.

  BRA'TAC
     The pain is fading.

  ANNOTATION

     droops to the side. Before he can collapse, Daniel
     supports him.

  DANIEL

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel helps O'Neill upright again. Teal'c helps
     Bra'tac sit up, who then looks at O'Neill
     gratefully. O'Neill looks astounded himself.

  BRA'TAC
     Once more I am in your debt.

  CARTER
     But how?

  TEAL'C
     (sounds shaken) O'Neill possesses the healing
     power of the Ancients.

  DANIEL
     (looking at O'Neill) Guess your condition is a
     little more advanced than last time.

     from him. Secret Service enters the room trying to
     shield their respective charges, while 5 others
     shoot at Anubis. That only leads to him shimmering
     and growing dim before looking normal again.

     America. One Nation among many.

  ANUBIS
     No more. Bow before your God!

  HAYES

     again) However, I am willing to discuss your
     surrender.

  ANUBIS
     If you possessed weapons matching mine you would
     have used them.

  HAYES
     Don't let the suit fool you, fella. We're gonna
     fight.

  ANUBIS
     You bring destruction upon yourselves.

  HAYES

     We are doing our best to get the word out to the
     public to remain calm.

     The next hit's gonna take us out.

  HAMMOND
     Hold your course, brace for collision. If we go,
     they go.


LOCATION--BELOW SURFACE, ANCIENT COMPLEX

  ANNOTATION
     The battle with the Super Soldiers continues,
     another one goes down. O'Neill, still on the
     chair, is bathed in bright light, he closes his
     eyes and a part of the ground between the ring
     area (and the Super Soldier left standing there)
     and SG-1 falls away, a yellowish light shines up.
     As SG-1 watches on, a stream of half transparent
     yellow things looking similar to jellyfish or
     octopus emerge from the ground and move towards
     the Super Soldier, enveloping him. He vanishes and
     the yellow beam moves up through the shaft created
     by the rings, hitting and destroying a number of
     Goa'uld gliders.


LOCATION--RONAN'S SHIP, COCKPIT

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac rises from his chair seeing the light and
     what happens to the gliders and smiles.

     still keeping a protective stance.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE EARTH

  ANNOTATION
     Prometheus is still rising to meet Anubis'
     Mothership when the beam reaches them and moves
     around and past Prometheus without causing harm,
     but when it splits up and connects with and enters
     the Mothership, it leaves damage.


LOCATION--ANUBIS' MOTHERSHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak has to hold on to his map table and Anubis
     and the Super Soldier guards are swaying, when the
     ship is shaking from the impact of the beam.

  ANNOTATION
     The beam splits to smaller beams and enters all
     available openings causing explosions.

     clear.

  HER'AK
     Our shields are of no use!

  ANNOTATION
     Anubis stands in front of the window watching the
     split-off rays of the beam destroy other ships in
     his fleet. He raises a hand as a bright light
     moves towards him.

  ANUBIS
     Noooo!


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE EARTH

  ANNOTATION
     One Goa'uld ship after the other explodes,
     Prometheus leaves the battle scene just in time
     before Anubis' ship blows up.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS COMMAND DECK

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, Kirkland, Gant and the crew watch the
     flash of light resulting from the last explosion.

  KIRKLAND
     What the hell was that?

  HAMMOND
     (sounds proud and relieved) That was SG-1.


LOCATION--SGC, TECH ROOM ABOVE GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Weir, the two Gate Technicians, a guard and a
     female scientist are listening to a report coming
     through the radio.

  VOICE
     Thousands of bright yellow...I don't
     know...They're coming from the surface. I don't
     know what they are. ...


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes is sitting at his desk listening to the same
     report as the SGC.

  VOICE
     ...They're cutting the enemy fleet to shreds. My
     God...beautiful!


LOCATION--BELOW SURFACE, ANCIENT COMPLEX

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill's eyes droop, then his head sinks to the
     side as he loses conciousness. The light dims.
     Daniel and Teal'c look over, Carter goes to check
     on him.

  CARTER
     Sir?...Sir? (lifts his head with her hands) (to
     Daniel and Teal'c) His pulse is erratic. (to
     O'Neill) Don't you dare leave us now. We won.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill opens his eyes and moves his head
     slightly.

  CARTER
     (grasping his chin) Colonel!


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS COMMAND DECK

  KIRKLAND
     Sir, I have the President for you.

  HAMMOND
     Patch him through.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes appears on a line of viewscreens. As Hammond
     talks to him, the crew watch on.

  HAMMOND
     Mister President, I'm confirming that the enemy
     has been defeated. The threat is eliminated.

  HAYES
     (via viewscreen, voice tinny) Congratulations,
     George. I don't know how we're ever going to be
     able to thank you.


LOCATION--BELOW SURFACE, ANCIENT COMPLEX

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill moves his lips but doesn't speak.

  CARTER
     (sounding desperate) Please!...Jack!...

  O'NEILL
     (whispering) Dormata.

  DANIEL
     (whispering) That thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c steps over as the chair rises up again and
     lifts O'Neill out of it, carrying him over to the
     niche they saw earlier. He puts him into it
     propping him up against the back wall of it. The
     niche lights up as Teal'c steps back.

  CARTER
     Now what?

  O'NEILL
     Aveo...amacuse.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c look at Daniel who translates,
     nodding.

  DANIEL
     Good bye.

  ANNOTATION
     The light in the niche grows brighter and O'Neill
     is frozen into it. The rest of SG-1 looks on,
     emotions playing over their faces.

  CARTER
     (sounding disbelieving and a little sad) We can't
     just leave him like this! There has to be a way to
     reverse the process. The answer has to be here
     somewhere.

  DANIEL
     (shaking his head, speaking quietly) I don't think
     this is it, Sam.

  CARTER
     What do you mean?

  DANIEL
     (looking up and around) The dome is too small.
     It's ...Taonas. It's obviously not a city; it's
     just an outpost of some kind.

  CARTER
     This isn't Atlantis?

  DANIEL
     (shaking his head) I don't think so.

  TEAL'C
     (looking from his team-mates to O'Neill) If this
     is not the Lost City, then where is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter steps up to the niche and looks at O'Neill
     with tears in her eyes. She touches her hand to
     the solid surface of the clear substance
     surrounding and suspending O'Neill. O'Neill seems
     to look out at this team.
