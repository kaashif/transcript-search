TEASER

LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE AN UNKNOWN PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     A death glider is trying to evade being fired upon
     by a Goa'uld mother ship. It is trying to get to
     escape to a planet below.


LOCATION--SURFACE OF ALIEN PLANET--STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 in desert cammos are seated on the steps of
     the Stargate, seemingly lounging around. Teal'c is
     walking around.

  DANIEL
     Shouldn't they be here by now?

  O'NEILL
     Yes.

  TEAL'C
     I do not believe the Tok'ra would mislead us.

  DANIEL
     Well, assuming it *was* the Tok'ra who sent us the
     message to meet them here in the first place. I
     mean, all we really received was a...a set of
     co-ordinates.

  CARTER
     But on our radio frequencies, who else would send
     us a signal like that?

  O'NEILL
     You know... (Turning to Carter) I'm not really too
     crazy about this 'don't call us we'll call you'
     policy.

  ANNOTATION
     Cut to Teal'c who is walking by the DHD, seemingly
     sensing something. An explosion is heard and he
     turns in the direction of the sound. He waits then
     slowly turns back around and looks up.

  TEAL'C
     (pointing at the sky) There!

  ANNOTATION
     The others look up. Quickly rising to their feet,
     they walk down the steps and watch as a death
     glider comes in under heavy fire. Seeing this,
     O'Neill acts.

  O'NEILL
     Drop!!

  ANNOTATION
     They all drop to the ground for cover as the death
     glider swoops past Teal'c's head, then over the
     rest of the team and crashes on the other side of
     a hill not far from the Stargate. SG-1 get to
     their feet and run to the crash site.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET--GLIDER CRASH SITE

  ANNOTATION
     Smoke and dust rises from the site of the glider's
     crash. The team make their way over to it. The
     team approach cautiously, O'Neill's weapon is
     poised, but the glider's cockpit appears empty.
     They inspect the area for a moment, then seeing
     someone on his belly crawling away from the wreck,
     O'Neill and Teal'c run over there, weapons raised.
     The unknown person turns over and we see it is
     none other than Apophis. His eyes glow. He is
     weakened by injuries.

  O'NEILL
     (Still aiming his weapon) Holy buckets.

  APOPHIS
     Help me!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill continues to point his weapon, warily.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET--GLIDER CRASH SITE

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis lies on the ground still, breathing
     heavily. Carter and Daniel run over and join
     O'Neill and Teal'c who tower above Apophis.

  O'NEILL
     (Dryly) Weeellll...

  DANIEL
     Whoa. Whoa. Is that who I think it is?

  APOPHIS
     (pleading) Tau'ri, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c quickly raises his zat and aims it at
     Apophis, ready to fire.

  CARTER
     Teal'c! Apophis is much more valuable to us alive
     than dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c considers her words and puts the Zat away.
     The engine of a spaceship can be heard, and
     Apophis points up at the sky. Carter looks to
     where he is pointing.

  CARTER
     (Raising her weapon) Sir. We've got incoming.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns his head, his gun still trained on
     Apophis. He sees a squadron of death gliders
     headed their way.

  O'NEILL
     Oy... (Turning back to Apophis) All right, dial us
     up. Get us out of here!


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET--STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     Gliders swoop in as Carter and O'Neill fire upon
     them. Daniel is dialing the Gate while Teal'c
     carries Apophis across his shoulders toward the
     Gate.

  CARTER
     What are they doing?

  TEAL'C
     They wish to take Apophis alive.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill continues firing as they run for the now
     activated Stargate. All run for the Gate. The
     others go through, but O'Neill stops at the event
     horizon, turns and comes face to face with a
     glider. He fires on it as he backs into the event
     horizon.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE TRAVEL


LOCATION--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill backs through the event horizon still
     firing his weapon, and falls back on the ramp as a
     blast from the death glider makes it through just
     before the iris closes. As O'Neill rises to his
     feet, Teal'c walks past General Hammond with
     Apophis. Hammond approaches O'Neill.

  HAMMOND
     (He casts a glance back at Apophis) Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     (Approaching the general) General Hammond.
     Apophis.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis has been placed on a gurney, a bit of a
     bloody mess. Dr. Fraiser and a nurse are tending
     to him as a half dozen SFs look on.

  O'NEILL
     Apophis. (smiling smugly) General Hammond.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis and Hammond look at each other.

  HAMMOND
     (Scornfully looking at the Goa'uld) We've met.

  APOPHIS
     I demand Kal Mah!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Daniel for a translation.

  DANIEL
     I'm not really sure, but I think what he's asking
     for is...

  TEAL'C
     Sanctuary.

  DANIEL
     Right.

  HAMMOND
     Why?

  O'NEILL
     I think some rival Goa'uld just kicked his ass.

  CARTER
     There were several other death gliders in pursuit
     when we took him prisoner, sir.

  APOPHIS
     (Loudly) I demand Kal Mah!

  HAMMOND
     You're not in a position to demand anything, sir.
     Lock him up.

  ANNOTATION
     Several SFs move forward to take him.

  FRAISER
     Sir, with all due respect, he is badly injured. He
     is not going to be any good to you at all unless
     we get him to the O.R. right now.

  HAMMOND
     Do what you need to keep him alive, Doctor. We've
     got a lot of questions that need answers.

  FRAISER
     Yes, sir. OK, let's move him. I'm going to start
     him on two IV's and run Ringer's Lactate wide
     open. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     The medical team run out with Apophis. The General
     turns to a Special Forces soldier.

  HAMMOND
     I want four SFs posted at all times. If he
     attempts to escape, you're authorized to do
     whatever is necessary to stop him.

  ANNOTATION
     The SF nods and signals to the others then leaves
     the Gate room, his team following him.

  HAMMOND
     (To SG-1.) We'll debrief at 1100hrs.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leaves with a sour look.

  O'NEILL
     (Looking at his watch) Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill appears pleased at their capture of
     Apophis.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis is surrounded by various monitors and
     equipment. He is in full five-point restraints as
     a nurse checks his vitals. Fraiser, Hammond, and
     SG-1 are watching from the observation area of the
     infirmary.

  FRAISER
     Both femurs were smashed, and there was internal
     bleeding. Surgery and transfusions have stabilized
     him for now.

  TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld symbiote within him will repair those
     injuries.

  FRAISER
     Well, I think it's kept him alive so far, Teal'c,
     but take a look at his monitors.

  ANNOTATION
     She inputs a command and we see a close-up on the
     monitor of a scan of Apophis' head, neck and upper
     chest. A reddish blotch indicating the symbiote
     implanted in his brain can be seen, while the body
     of the Goa'uld is entwined around the cervical
     spine.

  FRAISER
     See, what you're looking at is the actual symbiote
     attached to the host's brainstem. Now, do you see
     all these lesions? I mean, there's dozens of them.
     I can treat the human part, but as for the
     symbiote itself...

  CARTER
     There is no treatment.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill look at Carter.

  CARTER
     He's been tortured.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter closes her eyes, and we see a very brief
     flashback to when Carter had been taken over by
     Jolinar and was attacked by the Ashrak with his
     weapon. Carter flinches at the memory.

  O'NEILL
     (Concerned) Sam?

  CARTER
     I-I just had a memory of Jolinar. Pain, when she
     was killed by the Ashrak. The Ashrak had this
     device. He used it on us. It was meant to cause
     incredible pain. Apophis was tortured by the same
     thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks back at Apophis.


LOCATION--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM]

  ANNOTATION
     A close-up of Apophis' scan is on a monitor in the
     Briefing Room. Hammond, O'Neill and Fraiser are
     standing at the window overlooking the Stargate.
     Daniel, Carter and Teal'c are seated at the table.
     Hammond turns away from the monitor and looks at
     Fraiser.

  HAMMOND
     So he's dying.

  FRAISER
     Yes, sir.

  HAMMOND
     You're sure about that?

  FRAISER
     As sure as I can be, sir. Considering what we know
     of Goa'uld physiology.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond nods and moves to sit at the briefing
     table. O'Neill is playing with a pen.

  O'NEILL
     Good! (He looks at Fraiser) When?

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser and O'Neill move to the table. Fraiser
     takes a seat along with Hammond and the rest of
     SG-1, minus O'Neill who remains standing.

  FRAISER
     Without access to a sarcophagus, the Goa'uld body
     will continue to deteriorate, so we're looking at
     days, weeks, certainly.

  CARTER
     This kind of torture wasn't designed to extract
     information, it's a method of execution.

  O'NEILL
     So, what does he really want?

  DANIEL
     You heard him yourself. He wants sanctuary.

  O'NEILL
     I'm not buyin' that.

  DANIEL
     He gambled we would show compassion even to our
     worst enemy. He was right.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at O'Neill, whose eyebrows go up.

  O'NEILL
     You think he orchestrated this?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel waits for O'Neill to make his point.

  O'NEILL
     Let me tell ya something. (O'Neill sits down) The
     only compassion I showed was by not blowin' his
     head off.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at O'Neill, unconvinced.

  TEAL'C
     I have witnessed once powerful Goa'uld enter the
     service of their conquerors in exchange for life.
     When Apophis himself was a conqueror, it gave him
     great pleasure to see his enemies so weakened.

  CARTER
     Yeah, but we're along way from being his
     conquerors.

  TEAL'C
     (Smiling proudly) But we are greatly responsible
     for his downfall.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  HAMMOND
     He lost an Army when you destroyed those two ships
     in orbit.

  CARTER
     Bra'tac did say that that seriously weakened his
     place amongst the Goa'uld System Lords.

  DANIEL
     So his blood is in the water and all the other
     sharks are having a feeding frenzy.

  TEAL'C
     (Still smiling) And he has come here seeking
     refuge.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that's tough. I say we beat whatever
     information we can out of old snake boy, open that
     Gate, and toss him back to the sharks.

  HAMMOND
     Not so fast, Colonel. He's essentially a prisoner
     of war. That gives him certain rights.

  O'NEILL
     Rights, General?

  CARTER
     We also have to consider the host. (To O'Neill.)
     I'm sorry, sir, but we are dealing with two beings
     within one body.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill rolls his eyes dramatically.

  CARTER
     The symbiote may be an enemy, but the host is
     innocent.

  O'NEILL
     (Annoyed) Oh, come on! How much of the host do you
     think is still around after all this time?

  TEAL'C
     Apophis will have that knowledge.

  HAMMOND
     We also need to consider military intelligence. I
     have informed my superiors of our situation. My
     orders are to extract whatever information we can
     in the short time we may have.

  TEAL'C
     He will tell you nothing of use, General Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     If he believes it's in his own interest, he might.

  DANIEL
     We are the only thing that stands between him and
     whatever Goa'uld is after him on that planet.

  HAMMOND
     We need answers. (To Fraiser.) Let me know when
     he's conscious.

  FRAISER
     I'll inform you the moment he's ready for
     questioning, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill does not appear happy. As everyone leaves,
     O'Neill stands, lifts up his stack of papers and
     slams them back down on the table. Carter sees
     this.

  CARTER
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill picks up his stuff and heads to the exit.

  O'NEILL
     (snarling as he brushes past her) I should've shot
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter starts to protest, but stops.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Pan up from a close-up of Apophis' MRI scan to
     O'Neill, who is seated in the observation room,
     glaring at Apophis. Apophis lies on the bed, then
     suddenly wakes and looks around the room. O'Neill
     sees him and moves to the microphone.

  O'NEILL
     (Over the intercom) Dr. Frasier, he's awake.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser, who was working at a table near the
     observation room, turns and goes over to her
     patient. Apophis is still in five-point
     restraints, and each of his legs are in
     stabilization braces. She leans in to hear Apophis
     whisper something.

  O'NEILL
     Not so close, Doc.

  FRAISER
     (Looking up) He's not strong enough to do anything
     to hurt me, Colonel. (O'Neill shrugs) He wants to
     talk to you.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at her, then rises from the chair and
     heads down in to the room. Apophis watches as
     O'Neill enters the room.

  FRAISER
     He asked to speak to you by name.

  APOPHIS
     O'Neill, I am dying.

  O'NEILL
     My heart bleeds for you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts his hands in his pockets.

  APOPHIS
     You lie poorly. It is you who have done this. You
     rejoice.

  O'NEILL
     Not really. What do you want?

  APOPHIS
     To live.

  O'NEILL
     Can't help you there. That's between you and your
     God.

  ANNOTATION
     Then, as if he's had a great revelation.

  O'NEILL
     Oh wait a minute. You are your God.
     (Sarcastically) That's a problem.

  APOPHIS
     I am worth far more to you than you will admit.

  O'NEILL
     You tell me. What are you worth?

  APOPHIS
     Your people, they are still primitive. You will be
     destroyed.

  O'NEILL
     You don't look like you're up to it.

  APOPHIS
     Not me. There is another.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. Who?

  APOPHIS
     There is much you would learn from me, Tau'ri. (He
     wheezes) But for that knowledge, there is a
     price...a new host.

  O'NEILL
     (Incredulously) A host?

  APOPHIS
     So that I may live, in exchange for all the
     knowledge of the Goa'uld. The secrets of star
     travel, weapons, our power.

  O'NEILL
     (Mocking) All that?

  APOPHIS
     In time, more.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leans in close, then after a moment, he
     smiles.

  O'NEILL
     Go to hell.

  APOPHIS
     A single human life is worth so much you would
     risk a world.

  O'NEILL
     That's right. That's why they call us the good
     guys.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis looks away, disturbed. O'Neill continues
     to stare intently at him while speaking to
     Fraiser.

  O'NEILL
     Doc, let me know when he dies.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill heads for the door.

  APOPHIS
     Sokar.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stops at the door.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  APOPHIS
     An ancient and powerful Goa'uld. You have helped
     him to become strong. The last of my loyal Jaffa
     died stealing me from his grasp. He will not rest
     until I am found. That is why I chose to come
     here. So that in death, I can be assured that you
     can die with me.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the room, leaving Fraiser to tend
     to her patient.


LOCATION--SGC--DANIEL JACKSON'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is at his computer, while O'Neill, Carter
     and Teal'c are casually standing around his
     office.

  TEAL'C
     Sokar is a Goa'uld of ancient times. He once was
     ruler of the system lords, but was defeated by an
     alliance of Goa'uld many centuries ago. Apophis
     and Ra were among his conquerors.

  CARTER
     Where did he go?

  TEAL'C
     Apophis himself believed him destroyed, but,
     obviously, he was mistaken.

  O'NEILL
     Well, if he was almost wiped out, how bad could he
     be now.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at O'Neill, who holds up a placating
     hand.

  O'NEILL
     It's rhetorical, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     A new image on Daniel's computer displays.

  DANIEL
     His name's also very old in Earth mythology. He
     was the most feared deity in ancient Egypt, the
     original God of Death.

  O'NEILL
     Got anything a little more up-to-date.

  DANIEL
     Well, I don't know what he's been up to lately,
     but according to the book of the dead, there was a
     time he ruled all of Earth. His lands around
     Memphis were covered by darkness and inhabited
     by...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel punches a key on the keyboard and a new
     image pops up.

  DANIEL
     ...serpents.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at the image, then back to O'Neill.

  TEAL'C
     Unas. The first hosts of the Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     Well, that makes sense. I mean, if the Unas were
     the first ones, then there had to be a time when
     both forms of Goa'uld hosts co-existed. Kind of
     like Neanderthal...

  O'NEILL
     Which is he?

  DANIEL
     I don't know, but his portion of Tuat, or the
     otherworld, was filled with lakes of fire, where
     the wicked were thrown into as punishment after
     torture and mutilation.

  O'NEILL
     (Realization) Hell.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks to Daniel for confirmation.

  DANIEL
     Yeah. Basically, he was the original Satan.

  O'NEILL
     Well, isn't that special?

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons being to sound.

  P.A. SYSTEM
     Incoming Traveler.

  O'NEILL
     Speak of the devil.

  ANNOTATION
     They all get up and leave.


LOCATION--SGC--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A monitor displays "Incoming Traveler" as the Gate
     spins. Hammond rushes down the steps into the
     Control Room and races to the main console.

  HAMMOND
     Lieutenant Simmons!

  SIMMONS
     There are no units currently offworld, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     Close the iris.

  SIMMONS
     Yes, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris closes.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Armed personnel race to the Gate room.

  SOLDIER #1
     Go! Go, men!

  SOLDIER #2
     Go! Go! Go!

  ANNOTATION
     The soldiers run through the corridors.

  SOLDIER #1
     1, 2, 3! Move it!

  SOLDIER #2
     Let's go!

  ANNOTATION
     All rush into the Embarkation Room and get into
     position.

  SOLDIER #3
     On your left! On your left!

  ANNOTATION
     The soldiers take their positions and prepare
     their weapons for firing. Hammond and Simmons look
     on from the window. The chevrons lock in just as
     O'Neill enters the Control Room and moves to stand
     by Hammond. Daniel, Teal'c and Carter follow. A
     thud is heard, then a moment later, the wormhole
     shuts down.

  HAMMOND
     (Looking at Carter) Is there anyway to determine
     what that was?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir. We can get a radiation team in there to
     check the decay signature on the iris.

  SIMMONS
     (To Carter.) I'm on it, Captain. (Then speaking
     into his headset) Radiation team to Gate room.

  O'NEILL
     (To Hammond.) In the meantime, sir, I'd like to
     get back to the interrogation, if I might.

  HAMMOND
     Okay.

  DANIEL
     Sir, I'm kind of the resident expert on Sokar
     around here. I'd kind of like a shot at the
     interrogation.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond regards him for a moment, then looks to
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     (Pauses) Yeah, go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel leaves, and Hammond and O'Neill exchange
     glances.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     A nurse is attending to Apophis as Daniel enters.
     She walks away to look at a monitor near the door
     where Daniel is standing and waiting.

  DANIEL
     (To the nurse.) Is he conscious?

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis opens his eyes.

  APOPHIS
     Come, Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Cautiously, Daniel walks over to his bedside.

  DANIEL
     You know my name?

  APOPHIS
     Because of what we hold in common. Amaunet, my
     queen.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks away for a moment, then back at
     Apophis.

  DANIEL
     (Quietly) Her name is Sha're. She is my wife.

  APOPHIS
     They are one and the same.

  DANIEL
     Amaunet possesses her. Sha're is a prisoner. But
     she is somewhere. I want you to tell me where.

  APOPHIS
     Amaunet. (Smugly) I loved her. (He looks at
     Daniel) You do not believe me.

  DANIEL
     No. No, I...I don't think that's possible.

  APOPHIS
     How could you? Our minds, our knowledge, our very
     being is so much greater, so much more.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is seething, but remains calm.

  DANIEL
     (Quietly) I know where your child is.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis regards Daniel, disturbed by this
     revelation.

  APOPHIS
     My son?

  DANIEL
     Yes. I brought him into the world with my own
     hands on Abydos.

  APOPHIS
     He was taken by Heru'ur.

  DANIEL
     No. (Pointedly) By me.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis glares at Daniel.

  APOPHIS
     I have no use for the child now. Amaunet...
     (starting to bait Daniel again with a sneer) I
     knew from the moment I laid eyes on her, she was a
     vessel for a queen.

  DANIEL
     (Leaning in, in a deadly whisper) If you don't
     tell me where she is, I'll kill you right here.

  APOPHIS
     You have neither the strength nor the will.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pops in.

  CARTER
     Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at her, then Apophis takes in a deep
     breath, arching his back then crying out in pain.
     Daniel regards Apophis coldly as the Goa'uld
     writhes in pain, then Daniel slowly turns away and
     moves into the corridor with Carter. He leans up
     against the wall, clearly trying to calm himself.

  CARTER
     We...we think that thud we heard hitting the iris
     was a Sagan box. Its radioactive signature matches
     the one we gave the Tok'ra. They're coming here.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves. Then after glancing back into Apophis'
     room, Daniel follows.


LOCATION--SGC--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate begins to e ngage.Hammond, O'Neill,
     and Teal'c are joined by Carter, then Daniel.

  SIMMONS
     Incoming traveler.

  O'NEILL
     Decision time, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Captain Carter, are you 100% certain...

  ANNOTATION
     Simmons leaves his seat, and Carter takes it.

  CARTER
     That the signature matches the Tok'ra? Yes, sir.
     That it came from them? There's no way to be sure.

  HAMMOND
     What if one or more of the Tok'ra have been
     captured by Sokar and tortured?

  CARTER
     I don't think that they would give us up.

  O'NEILL
     I'm with Carter, General. I say we keep the door
     open.

  HAMMOND
     Very well.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole establishes, and SFs lock and load.
     Momentarily, three Tok'ra step through the event
     horizon. Martouf is among them. He heads down the
     ramp and smiles as he sees Carter enter the
     Embarkation Room.

  MARTOUF
     Samantha.

  CARTER
     (She smiles warmly back) Martouf.

  HAMMOND
     (Over intercom) Defense team you may stand down.

  ANNOTATION
     SFs put away their weapons. O'Neill is also a part
     of the welcoming committee at the bottom of the
     ramp.

  MARTOUF
     I offer you greetings from the High Council of the
     Tok'ra.

  ANNOTATION
     He bows slightly.

  CARTER
     Why didn't my father come?

  MARTOUF
     He's dealing with more urgent matters. We come
     only to offer you a word of warning.

  O'NEILL
     Which is?

  MARTOUF
     We know you have Apophis as your prisoner. You
     must return him to the planet you retrieved him
     from immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks to O'Neill who regards Martouf
     curiously.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY OBSERVATION AREA.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks into the observation room and looks
     on as a nurse checks Apophis' pupils.


LOCATION--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Martouf sits between his two Tok'ra companions and
     address Hammond and SG-1 excluding Teal'c) .

  MARTOUF
     Since Jacob has joined the Tok'ra, I have come to
     a...deeper understanding of your people, your
     purpose, and your extraordinary gifts.

  HAMMOND
     (Fraiser stands beside him) Thank you.

  MARTOUF
     You've shown great skill and cunning in retrieving
     Apophis from the hands of Sokar. However...

  O'NEILL
     You know, as much as I love where you're going
     with this, we...didn't exactly do that.

  MARTOUF
     Our operatives aboard Sokar's vessel witnessed you
     leave the crash site and enter the Stargate.

  CARTER
     We received a signal, a set of coordinates. We had
     thought it came from you.

  MARTOUF
     We sent no such signal.

  O'NEILL
     We know that now.

  MARTOUF
     Then who?

  O'NEILL
     We're going to assume it was Apophis.

  ANNOTATION
     Ducking his head, Martouf becomes Lantesh.

  LANTESH
     (Harshly) Why would he take refuge among the
     Tau'ri? He despises you. More than that, you have
     nothing of use to him.

  O'NEILL
     He's going down, and he wants to take us with him.

  ANNOTATION
     Lantesh casts a side glance at one of his
     companions, then sighs.

  LANTESH
     He has taken advantage of your weakness.

  CARTER
     (Defensive) We don't consider what we did a sign
     of weakness.

  LANTESH
     Then you are fools. Turn him over to Sokar now,
     and he may spare you.

  HAMMOND
     I'm afraid we can't do that just yet.

  LANTESH
     If he remains here, you will all die. If not by
     the hand of Sokar, then by the many Goa'uld who
     would wish to destroy Apophis themselves. You do
     not see what you have done. You've entered a
     battle in which you are ill-equipped to
     fight--tipped the balance of power among the
     Goa'uld, and in so doing, worsened the fortune of
     your entire race.

  HAMMOND
     We must know what would happen to him if we turned
     him over.

  LANTESH
     I'm certain he would be executed...eventually.

  HAMMOND
     I see.

  LANTESH
     Surely, you welcome this. His guilt is clear. He
     cannot be allowed to escape punishment.

  FRAISER
     He won't. He's dying.

  LANTESH
     You are certain of this.

  FRAISER
     Yes. His body has begun to age at an increasing
     rate.

  LANTESH
     Without a sarcophagus to rejuvenate him. Of
     course.

  HAMMOND
     In the short time he has remaining, we may yet
     learn information that could help us to defend
     ourselves.

  LANTESH
     The knowledge and technology are too primitive for
     such information to be of any use. (Forcefully)
     Why don't you comprehend the danger you are in? We
     cannot defend you from the Goa'uld. You cannot
     expect us, too.

  O'NEILL
     (Glares at him, but calmly) We don't.

  ANNOTATION
     Lantesh regards O'Neill.

  LANTESH
     Overconfidence was their failing, O'Neill. I hope
     it has not also become yours.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill purses his lips, but looks defiant.
     Lantesh relinquishes control to Martouf.

  MARTOUF
     (Chuckling lightly and placatingly) Forgive
     Lantesh. He is sometimes passionate in his
     opinions. (sighs) We cannot and would not force
     you to do anything, but since we have not
     convinced you of the danger you face, may we see
     him?

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks at O'Neill, who then looks at
     Martouf.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Fraiser is injecting something into an IV.
     SG-1 (minus Teal'c), and the Tok'ra enter the
     room.

  MARTOUF
     What is that you are injecting into his body?

  FRAISER
     Morphine sulphate.

  CARTER
     To ease the pain.

  MARTOUF
     Yes, you said he had been tortured.

  FRAISER
     (Snapping off her gloves) He's also experiencing
     withdrawal symptoms from the sarcophagus.

  MARTOUF
     But he is your enemy.

  FRAISER
     (Pointedly) He is my patient.

  APOPHIS
     (Dazedly) Amaunet.

  MARTOUF
     Apophis, hear me.

  APOPHIS
     Amaunet!

  MARTOUF
     I would speak with you.

  APOPHIS
     Amaunet!!! My love!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks upset, O'Neill throws him a
     supportive glance.

  APOPHIS
     Where are you? ARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly, Apophis opens his eyes. He gazes around
     him and looks fearful. The Goa'uld voice is gone.

  APOPHIS/HOST
     See-mu-we! See-mu-we!

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks up at the team. O'Neill tilts his
     head uncomprehending.

  DANIEL
     That's ancient Egyptian. This must be the host.

  HOST
     She-rawh-tai! She-rawh-tai!

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) Well, talk to him.

  DANIEL
     (Waving his hand helplessly) I don't know what to
     say.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis/Host looks around again in pain, then
     passes out.

  DANIEL
     (Observing compassionately) Thousands of years
     trapped inside your own body. It's...it's like a
     nightmare. It's unimaginable.

  FRAISER
     He won't be conscious again for a while.

  MARTOUF
     (To Carter.) Then we will take our leave of you. I
     will tell you the coordinates to send us.

  CARTER
     Well, we can question him together. We can share
     whatever information we can get.

  P.A. SYSTEM
     Incoming Traveler.

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons begin t osound.

  O'NEILL
     (To Martouf.) Expecting someone?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill heads out the door, followed closely by
     Carter.

  MARTOUF
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Martouf and his companions follow.


LOCATION--SGC--EMBARKATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Soldiers get into position, weapons aimed and
     ready as the Gate is spinning into activity. The
     iris is closed.

  SIMMONS
     (Over intercom) Defense teams, stand by.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Martouf join Hammond beside Simmons at
     the console.

  HAMMOND
     Keep that iris closed.

  SIMMONS
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Many thuds are heard hitting the iris.

  MARTOUF
     Sokar has found you.

  O'NEILL
     How?

  MARTOUF
     His pilots saw your kind flee with Apophis through
     the Chappa'ai. Symbols for the Tau'ri are well
     known among the Goa'uld.

  ANNOTATION
     More thuds against the iris.

  O'NEILL
     That iris will hold.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill moves to sit down in the chair Simmons has
     vacated again.

  CARTER
     (To Martouf.) It's a Trinium Titanium alloy just a
     few microns from the event horizon. It won't allow
     matter to reintegrate.

  TEAL'C
     (Observing the Gate closely) Something is
     appearing.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris appears to be distorting. It is turning
     red, appearing to be getting hotspots.

  CARTER
     How is this possible?

  ANNOTATION
     She sits down at the controls, and begins typ
     ingintothecomputer.

  MARTOUF
     The space between your metal barrier and the
     wormhole may be enough for particles of extremely
     high energy to reintegrate.

  CARTER
     Subatomic particles?

  MARTOUF
     Yes.

  CARTER
     Are you saying he's firing a particle accelerator
     at the wormhole?

  HAMMOND
     Captain?

  CARTER
     Sir, we may be witnessing the decay of subatomic
     particles as there being bombarded against the
     iris. Small enough to reintegrate but moving at
     nearly light velocity. If Sokar can modulate the
     particle stream enough to create an actual
     image...

  SOKAR
     (His voice through the wormhole) People of the
     Tau'ri.

  ANNOTATION
     They look at the wormhole, uneasy. The reddish
     image seems to be a face, and it's talking.

  SOKAR
     You have taken what is mine. For this, you will be
     destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks on, incredulous, as the wormhole
     deactivates.

  SIMMONS
     The iris is beginning to heat up, sir.

  HAMMOND
     How long can they maintain this?

  CARTER
     The longest single Goa'uld attack against the iris
     was 38 minutes. We think that's the maximum a
     wormhole can be maintained before it collapses.

  DANIEL
     They're just going to dial us up and do all of
     this all over again.

  HAMMOND
     This changes things. I better get on the phone
     with the President.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond rushes off to his office.

  CARTER
     (To Martouf.) Can you help us?

  MARTOUF
     I know of no way.

  O'NEILL
     All right. In the meantime, Carter, why don't you
     see what you can get out of Apophis. His neck's on
     the line here now, too.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  TEAL'C
     I will accompany you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter leave, as O'Neill continues to
     watch the Gate.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Close-up of monitor with MRI view of Apophis. Pan
     down to Apophis who is growing older and weaker.
     Carter and Teal'c are at the foot of his bed.

  APOPHIS
     (Lifting up his head defiantly) I will not speak
     to the Shol'va.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Teal'c then back.

  CARTER
     Just answer this: Sokar is firing some sort of
     particle beam at the barrier we've placed within
     our Stargate. How do we defend against it?

  APOPHIS
     There is no defense.

  TEAL'C
     He lies.

  APOPHIS
     Shol'va, kree!

  CARTER
     How can you be so sure?

  APOPHIS
     Because he used the weapon against me.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis grunts and writhes.

  APOPHIS
     The pain returns.

  CARTER
     (To Teal'c.) We're not going to get anything out
     of him in this state. I'll get Dr. Frasier.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods, and Carter leaves. Teal'c then smiles
     and moves closer to Apophis who eyes his movement
     warily.

  TEAL'C
     I have waited many years for this moment.

  APOPHIS
     Do you think you have won, Teal'c? You are about
     to die.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps that is so. But my people have won
     freedom.

  APOPHIS
     The Jaffa will never be free.

  TEAL'C
     They are free even now...as am I. Hear me,
     Apophis. This day will become a holy day on
     Chulak. The day of your death.

  APOPHIS
     The larval Goa'uld you carry with in you is your
     master even now. All of you. When the time comes
     for those children to take a host, you will die.

  TEAL'C
     Then we will find other symbiotes to survive upon.
     Then discard them when they mature. We will use
     your kind as you have used mine.

  APOPHIS
     No!

  TEAL'C
     The people of Chulak no longer worship you. They
     no longer fear you.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis hears his words and is in distress.

  TEAL'C
     The time of Apophis has finally come to an end.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles.

  APOPHIS
     Then kill me now.

  TEAL'C
     Tell us how to defend ourselves against this
     weapon.

  APOPHIS
     (He regards Teal'c with a sneer) I will die with a
     smile on my lips. Knowing you will die along with
     me, shol'va.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser walks in, a syringe in her hand, with
     Carter following her.

  TEAL'C
     Come no further. Let him suffer.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks at Teal'c, alarmed, as does Carter.

  TEAL'C
     And when he can stand the pain no more, he will
     tell us how to defend ourselves against Sokar's
     weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis squirms and grunts in pain.

  FRAISER
     (Calmly) Teal'c, please move.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c glowers at her.

  APOPHIS
     There was a time when you would die for me,
     Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     (Leaning in close and sneering) That time is no
     more.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis struggles against his restraints and
     Teal'c walks away.

  APOPHIS
     (painfully)

  AAAAARRRGGGHHHHHH!


  FRAISER
     Easy.

  ANNOTATION
     She injects the contents of the syringe into his
     IV.

  FRAISER
     Easy.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis settles down a bit.

  CARTER
     All right. These shields of yours, they obviously
     absorb different forms of energy maybe we could...

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis raises his head towards Carter. A chain
     holds him back. He looks her over.

  APOPHIS
     I sense a presence within you.

  CARTER
     (Nervously) Could your shields help us or not?

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis slowly lies back down.

  APOPHIS
     You were once possessed by a Goa'uld. I'm sure you
     would make an excellent host for Sokar's new
     queen.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter assumes appropriate pissed look.

  ANNOTATION
     A tank of liquid nitrogen is being adjusted as
     Hammond storms into the room.

  HAMMOND
     Airman!

  ANNOTATION
     He points severely at the Gate, then joins Sgt
     Siler on the ramp, who is wearing a heat resistant
     outfit and dousing the iris with the liquid
     nitrogen.

  HAMMOND
     Pour it on, Sergeant! It's getting damn hot in
     here!

  SILER
     Better than nothing, sir. Not by much.

  ANNOTATION
     The liquid nitrogen turns instantly to steam at it
     hits the iris. Hammond wipes the sweat from his
     brow and leaves.


LOCATION--SGC--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel are there. The window looking
     out upon the Gate room is covered in steam.

  O'NEILL
     General, Daniel just came up with an idea that
     might buy us some time.

  DANIEL
     Sir, if we can dial out, we can prevent them from
     dialing in for as long as we can keep the Gate
     open.

  HAMMOND
     Good thinking, Doctor. If we can keep our Gate
     open for the same link of time...

  SIMMONS
     Coming up to 38 minutes, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Stand by.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate shuts down, the iris glows red from the
     heat.

  O'NEILL
     GO ahead, dial it up.

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows the first chevron engaged.

  SIMMONS
     Chevron one encoded.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate spins and the monitor displays
     another chevron engaged.

  SIMMONS
     Chevron two encoded.

  DANIEL
     The only thing I'm worried about is that...

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor displays "Caution: Incoming Traveler."
     The Gate activates.

  SIMMONS
     Incoming wormhole established.

  DANIEL
     Sokar can dial in faster than we can dial out.

  O'NEILL
     Damn it.

  SIMMONS
     (To O'Neill) Sorry, sir. Next window is 38 minutes
     away.

  DANIEL
     That may be our last chance to dial out.

  ANNOTATION
     Siler and the other men prepare the nitrogen tanks
     again.

  O'NEILL
     (To Hammond) It's going to get hot, Sir.


LOCATION--SGC--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Hammond are standing at the window
     overlooking the Stargate. The rest of SG-1 and
     Martouf and the Tok'ra are present. Hammond turns
     from the steamy window.

  HAMMOND
     The temperature in the Gate room now reads 130
     degrees Fahrenheit, which means the iris must be
     six or eight times that.

  MARTOUF
     Even if he fails to breech the Gate, he will come
     by ship.

  CARTER
     Martouf is right. What we really need to be
     concerned with here is another assault from space.
     That's exactly what we're inviting by refusing to
     hand Apophis over.

  DANIEL
     Well, we couldn't right now, even if we wanted to.

  O'NEILL
     Not with Beelzebub banging at the door, no.

  HAMMOND
     I've informed the President of our new situation.
     Our new orders are to cease all medical
     intervention.

  FRAISER
     That will effectively end his life, General.

  HAMMOND
     I'm aware of that, Doctor. The President and Joint
     Chiefs have decided that the risks are too great
     not to heed the Tok'ra's warning. Our orders are
     to send Apophis' body back through the Gate to the
     coordinates where you found him.

  TEAL'C
     Will that be sufficient to make Sokar cease his
     attack, Martouf?

  MARTOUF
     Sokar is at war with Her'ur. He wants no part of
     the Tau'ri for the moment, but you may have come
     to your senses too late. He will soon burn through
     your iris.

  CARTER
     Well, I've been working on a way to dial out
     faster. If we can open our Gate in the next
     window, we should be able to send Apophis through.

  O'NEILL
     When is that?

  CARTER
     (looking at her watch) 17 minutes.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel, make arrangements to send Apophis back
     through the Stargate.

     Depet reshwet herew...herew.

  DANIEL
     ...and now he awakens only to die again.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at O'Neill, who is looking on,
     concerned. Then Daniel speaks to the host.

  DANIEL
     Ar ko-me di-ya tuw qu-ris Yam-yakh-cle. Ip-yak,
     shur-see-buy, sof-khow, miy-yak, hee-ma-ta
     she-rahw-tak.

  ANNOTATION
     The host is listening.

  DANIEL
     Hiy-yak, han-vy-sun heyh-hu. Heyh-hu.

  ANNOTATION
     The host nods weakly. Then to O'Neill and Fraiser.

  DANIEL
     I said I will speak the words of power and do the
     rites. He will be returned to Egypt and buried
     with honour. He will pass through the seven gates
     and see your wife and children again and rejoice
     with them forever. I'll be back.


LOCATION--SGC--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The computer shows the temperature has risen to
     over 200 degrees in the Gate room. The iris glows
     a bright red. Hammond, Carter, Teal'c and Simmons
     gaze out on the iris.

  SIMMONS
     Sir we're going to lose the computers. The heat.

  HAMMOND
     Captain?

  CARTER
     We need them, sir. One more minute until the
     window.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis and his host lay dying. His eyes glow
     briefly from the old and wrinkled host.

  APOPHIS
     (weakly) Help me.

  O'NEILL
     No.

  APOPHIS
     A host.

  O'NEILL
     No.

  APOPHIS
     (His eyes glow again) I am...afraid.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill says nothing and watches as Apophis' eyes
     fade out. Then suddenly, Apophis gasps violently.

  FRAISER
     Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     She gently pushes him aside, and puts her hand to
     Apophis' cheek. He gasps over and over, then the
     heart monitor tones, indicating a flatline.

  FRAISER
     The Goa'uld is dead, but the host... (stunned)
     He's still alive.


LOCATION--SGC--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate shuts down.

  CARTER
     That's it. Initiate the dialing program.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate turns into activity and a chevron
     locks in place on the computer.

  SIMMONS
     The program is running.

  ANNOTATION
     They look on as the second chevron locks in place.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel holds a small figurine in his hand and puts
     it on the tray table.

  DANIEL
     Yet-yau tau-ti ky-puum ni fadet oo-ra-eyu. In yaf
     ki-yaak a ku-mayi. (To O'Neill and Fraiser.) I
     told him this funerary statue will take his last
     breath and carry his soul back to Egypt.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill observes solemnly.


LOCATION--SCG--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The fifth chevron locks in place.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel remains by Apophis' host while O'Neill
     shifts around on his feet, uncomfortably. Close-up
     on the host's mouth as he takes his last breath,
     then pans to a close-up of the funerary statue
     that is to carry his soul to Egypt.


LOCATION--SCG--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The sixth chevron locks in place. The Stargate
     spins once more, and the seventh chevron lights
     up.

  CARTER
     Chevron seven locked.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate activates.

  SIMMONS
     Wormhole established.

  HAMMOND
     Open the Iris.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens, and Hammond turns to Teal'c, who
     then leaves.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis' cloak is placed over his head. Teal'c
     hurriedly enters the room.

  TEAL'C
     Captain Carter has succeeded in creating an
     outgoing wormhole. Sokar cannot attack during this
     time.

  O'NEILL
     That's good.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c slowly moves into the room and approaches
     the bed where Apophis' body lays. He moves next to
     O'Neill, then carefully pulls back the cover to
     see. O'Neill stands silently next to Teal'c as the
     former First Prime of Apophis processes the fact
     that Apophis is truly dead.


LOCATION--SGC--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole remains activated and SG-1, the
     Tok'ra, Hammond and Fraiser watch as Teal'c
     carries Apophis' body up the ramp. He looks upon
     the blanket-wrapped body of his former god for a
     moment, then passes it through the wormhole.
     Everyone looks on solemnly as the wormhole pulls
     the body through. Teal'c then turns and heads back
     down the ramp and leaves the room. The Gate then
     shuts down. Fraiser follows Teal'c.

  DANIEL
     (To no one in particular.) What now?

  O'NEILL
     We wait.

  CARTER
     If Sokar wanted him alive, he'll just start up the
     attack again.

  MARTOUF
     No. I don't believe he will. Sokar has a
     sarcophagus in his possession. With it, he can
     revive Apophis even through death and torture him
     as long as he pleases.

  ANNOTATION
     The Tau'ri exchange sober glances. Martouf looks
     at them curiously.

  MARTOUF
     Surely, a fate he justly deserves.

  ANNOTATION
     They shift uncomfortably, but say nothing.


LOCATION--SGC--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Martouf types something in the keyboard at the
     Command console. Carter is standing by the
     console, as are Daniel, O'Neill, and Hammond.
     Martouf's Tok'ra companions are waiting at the
     base of the ramp.

  MARTOUF
     These are the coordinates we would like you send
     us.

  CARTER
     But not to anywhere we'll be able to find you
     again.

  MARTOUF
     To contact us, you may use this.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands her a communications device.

  DANIEL
     That's Tollan. They used it to contact the Nox.

  MARTOUF
     Yes, we are friends of the Tollan, and we are
     friends of the Tau'ri.

  CARTER
     Thank you.

  O'NEILL
     Well, if we're going to be friends, you're going
     to need one of these.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands Martouf a GDO.

  O'NEILL
     It's called a G D O. It sends out a signal that
     let's us know who you are and if it's ok to open
     the iris. Otherwise, you could end up splattered
     against the...well...

  MARTOUF
     (smiling) I understand.

  CARTER
     Come on. I'll show you how it works.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Martouf go down to the Gate room.

  HAMMOND
     All right. Let's send them home people.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate spins into action, and O'Neill looks on
     from the control room, contemplatively.
