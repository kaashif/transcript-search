LOCATION--ANUBIS' PLANET


LOCATION--ANUBIS' TEMPLE

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al enters and walks to Anubis, who is sitting
     on his throne.

  ANUBIS
     You have failed me.

  BA'AL
     We've known for some time that the Jaffa cannot be
     trusted any more. The remaining army of Kull
     Warriors still stand an excellent chance of
     retaking Dakara.

  ANNOTATION
     Anubis, blisters around his mouth, raises his hand
     to stop Ba'al.

  ANUBIS
     Worse than failure. Worse than cowardice.

  ANNOTATION
     Anubis stands, taking a step closer to Ba'al.

  ANUBIS
     You have betrayed me. Did you not think I would
     know what you have done? How can you still
     underestimate my powers?

  BA'AL
     Your methods were ultimately unnecessary. Not when
     there was another way of defeating the
     Replicators.

  ANUBIS
     I will spare your life for the moment, only so
     that you may witness the fruits of your labours.
     First, I will retake Dakara, then, thanks to the
     modifications you've made to the Stargate, I will
     destroy every living thing in this galaxy,
     including you, all at once.

  BA'AL
     I do not understand. You could have modified the
     Stargate yourself.

  ANUBIS
     You have no way of knowing what is necessary and
     what is not, in the grand design.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al looks puzzled.

  BA'AL
     Whose grand design?

  ANUBIS
     Mine!

  ANNOTATION
     As Anubis leaves, Ba'al stares at him.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters the briefing room and walks towards
     O'Neill's office. She pauses as a woman's voice is
     heard from the office. O'Neill and the woman are
     standing by the corridor door, then the woman
     leaves. Carter appears uncomfortable. O'Neill
     shuts the corridor door, turns to his desk and
     sees Carter. He beckons her in. Carter grimaces
     slightly, then walks into the office.


LOCATION--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  CARTER
     Sorry, Sir. I saw you were with someone. I didn't
     want to interrupt.

  O'NEILL
     What's up?

  CARTER
     Who was that?

  O'NEILL
     Um, Kerry Johnson. CIA.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sits, while Carter stands at the side of
     the desk.

  CARTER
     I've heard the name. Oh, she was heading up the
     investigation into Goa'uld still at large after
     the incident with The Trust.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  CARTER
     Sir, I wanted to talk to you about...

  O'NEILL
     Carter.

  CARTER
     We haven't heard from him in a week.

  O'NEILL
     Doesn't mean anything.

  CARTER
     Sir, we know he was captured by Replicators.
     Chances are he was onboard a replicator ship when
     it disintegrated.

  O'NEILL
     All we know for sure is that he's missing.

  CARTER
     Sooner or later...

  O'NEILL
     Forget it! I'm not falling for it this time!

  CARTER
     Falling for it?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. How many times have you thought he was gone
     and then he shows up... in one form or another.
     I'm sorry, but we're not having a memorial service
     for someone who is not dead.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks up at the corner of the room.

  O'NEILL
     (shouts) Do you hear that? I'm not buying it!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks around the room then looks at
     O'Neill, surprised. O'Neill also looks around the
     room, waiting for a response from Daniel. He looks
     at Carter, seeing that she is staring at him,
     bemused.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter raises her eyebrows then looks down.

  O'NEILL
     He's just waiting for us to say a bunch of nice
     things about him. Next thing you know, he'll come
     waltzing through that door. Like, right now.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures to the corridor door. Both he and
     Carter look at the door and wait.

  O'NEILL
     Waltzing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns to look at O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Now.

  ANNOTATION
     As nothing happens, O'Neill turns to find Carter
     once again looking at him in amazement.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel enters a diner from a sunlit street. The
     diner is busy, with many customers at the booths
     and staff bustling around. A 'Please seat
     yourself' sign is just inside the entrance. Daniel
     looks around, frowning and walks further into the
     diner. He looks around at the customers then sits
     in a booth. A waitress walks up to him.

  OMA
     So, what can I get for you?

  ANNOTATION
     The waitress is Oma Desala. Daniel stares at her,
     shocked.


LOCATION--DAKARA TEMPLE

  ANNOTATION
     A number of Jaffa are in the temple. Teal'c,
     Bra'tac and Tolok stand before them.

  TOLOK
     Brothers Bra'tac of Chulak and Teal'c of the
     Tau'ri. For your enduring courage and vision, for
     the strength of will that has brought us to
     freedom from the Goa'uld, a future we have yet to
     even comprehend, but one that will be determined
     by our own unfettered will, I hereby bestow upon
     you the highest honour any Jaffa can know.

  ANNOTATION
     Tolok places the tip of a staff weapon to their
     shoulders.

  TOLOK
     From this day forward, you shall both be known as
     blood kin, to all Jaffa!!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa cheer. Tolok raises his hand to silence
     the Jaffa, who all kneel to Teal'c and Bra'tac.
     They both look at each other, unhappy to see the
     Jaffa kneeling. Bra'tac walks up to Tolok and,
     taking his arm, makes him rise.

  BRA'TAC
     Brothers!

  ANNOTATION
     The other Jaffa rise.

  BRA'TAC
     From this day forward, no Jaffa shall bow before
     anyone, and never again before a false God.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods at Bra'tac and Tolok. Tolok turns to
     the assembled Jaffa.

  TOLOK
     Hail, Brother Bra'tac! Hail, Brother Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa yell out in response, and a horn is
     blown. Teal'c and Bra'tac, hands to their hearts,
     turn to walk out.

  BRA'TAC
     Be proud, Teal'c. Today we are free.

  TEAL'C
     This day is not yet over with.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk to the entrance to see thousands of
     Jaffa gathered below, who raise their arms and
     shout.

  BRA'TAC
     Then I shall be proud for you, and of you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Bra'tac turn to each other, smiling
     slightly.


LOCATION--DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     A number of ships hover over the planet, while
     more fly overhead the thousands of Jaffa.


LOCATION--SGC COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is standing in the corridor outside an
     elevator, appearing nervous. The elevator opens to
     show Pete and an Airman.

  PETE
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     Pete steps out of the elevator.

  CARTER
     Hi! Thank you, Airman.

  ANNOTATION
     As the Airman walks away, Pete kisses her on the
     cheek.

  PETE
     So, this is exciting. What's the surprise?

  CARTER
     You'll see.

  ANNOTATION
     They start to walk along the corridor.

  PETE
     Do I get to go through the Stargate? I mean, what
     planet are we going to?

  CARTER
     You don't get to go through the Stargate.

  PETE
     Okay. I'm a little disappointed. Still, full
     security clearance and an all access pass to the
     SGC? This must be big.

  CARTER
     Oh, it's big.


LOCATION--SGC GUEST QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Carter knocks on the door then enters, Pete behind
     her. Jacob is sitting in a chair and rises as they
     walk in.

  CARTER
     Pete Shanahan. Jacob Carter. Dad, this is Pete.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete appears stunned.

  PETE
     Dad?

  JACOB
     Not quite yet. You have to actually marry my
     daughter before you can call me that.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grins.

  PETE
     I was just... I meant...stammer, stammer. It's an
     honour to meet you, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete steps forward to shake Jacob's hand.

  PETE
     Really.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Carter.

  PETE
     Why didn't you tell me?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is grinning nervously.

  CARTER
     I didn't want you to be nervous.

  PETE
     Why would I? I wouldn't. I... I've been dying to
     meet you.

  JACOB
     I think it was Sam that was nervous.

  PETE
     How did not telling me help?

  CARTER
     It didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete and Jacob look at each other. In the silence,
     Carter looks uncomfortable. Jacob looks serious as
     Pete continues to smile.

  PETE
     This is great! You really got one of those things
     in your head?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Pete, the question wiping the
     smile off her face.

  JACOB
     If by one of those things, you mean a 2,000 year
     old Tok'ra symbiote. Yes.

  PETE
     Seriously. Come on... that has got to freak you
     right out sometimes. It's weird.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles and shakes her head, while Jacob
     simply looks at Pete. As Jacob looks at Carter,
     she again smiles nervously, turning to Pete who is
     still grinning.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Oma, notebook in hand, is standing at Daniel's
     table. A man (Jim), sitting at the counter, turns
     round to speak to Oma.

  JIM
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     Oma and Daniel turn to look at him.

  JIM
     What do I have to do to get some more coffee
     around here?

  OMA
     Find your enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma turns back to look at Daniel, obviously
     waiting for him to order.

  DANIEL
     Menus?

  OMA
     We don't need them here, just order what you'd
     like.

  DANIEL
     Okay, I'll have the truth with a side order of
     clarity, please.

  OMA
     The replicator version of Sam was in your head
     trying to access the knowledge buried in your
     subconscious. But you gained control of her
     instead. She killed you to stop you. That's where
     I stepped in. How's that?

  DANIEL
     Pretty clear.

  OMA
     Well, we aim to please. Customer comes first, you
     know.

  DANIEL
     So I'm ascended again.

  OMA
     Not exactly. Sort of a stop along the way. You
     have to make that choice for yourself.

  DANIEL
     Waffles.

  OMA
     Bacon on the side?

  DANIEL
     No, I remember this place.

  OMA
     You should, it came from your mind.

  DANIEL
     My Grandfather brought me here after my parents'
     funeral. I had waffles.

  OMA
     Waffles it is!

  ANNOTATION
     Oma turns to leave.

  DANIEL
     Wait. How do I know it's really you this time. How
     do I know this isn't some trick Replicator Sam's
     playing to stop me from controlling her?

  ANNOTATION
     Oma steps back to Daniel.

  OMA
     How deep is the river if you cannot see the
     bottom?

  ANNOTATION
     Jim turns, waving his coffee mug.

  JIM
     Deeper than the coffee in my cup, I'll tell you
     that.

  OMA
     (to Daniel) Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma walks away.

  OMA
     Frank, I need a Noah's boy in a blanket, two hen
     fruit wrecked on a shingle with a mystery in the
     alley.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks bemused.

  OMA
     A warm Eve with a moldy lid and two checkerboards,
     all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Oma walks behind the counter and places the order
     on a hook.

  OMA
     Oh yeah, hold the pig.


LOCATION--DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     A couple of ships fly past the temple.


LOCATION--DAKARA TEMPLE INNER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is standing by the Ancient computer as
     Bra'tac walks up to him.

  BRA'TAC
     We have dreamed of this day for so long. Fought so
     hard for it and sacrificed so much. Now that it is
     here...

  TEAL'C
     It is not here, brother.

  BRA'TAC
     The balance of power has shifted, Teal'c. Our
     victory here at Dakara has turned the tide. Jaffa
     everywhere are abandoning the old ways, coming to
     see the Goa'uld for the false Gods they are.

  TEAL'C
     We are foolish to rejoice in conquest over the
     Goa'uld when they are not all dead. Anubis' claim
     to be a God is false, but his powers most
     certainly are not.

  BRA'TAC
     It is agreed. He must be dealt with. But for once,
     there may be greater concerns than the eradication
     of all the Goa'uld. So consumed were we in
     attaining freedom, that we did not plan nearly
     enough for its aftermath. The Jaffa have fought
     with each other for so long that uniting them as
     one may prove as difficult a task as convincing
     them to free themselves from the Goa'uld.
     Generations of war and mistrust will not be healed
     overnight.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. If we do not organize quickly freedom will
     become anarchy.

  BRA'TAC
     The High Priests are proposing a leadership be
     assembled.

  TEAL'C
     That is wise.

  BRA'TAC
     They wish both of us to sit on the council.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods briefly.

  BRA'TAC
     You know that will take you from the Tau'ri.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks concerned. Bra'tac turns and puts his
     hand on Teal'c's shoulder.

  BRA'TAC
     Your purpose in joining them was to one day free
     the Jaffa. Now that day is upon us. You must not
     abandon your people when we need you most.

  TEAL'C
     Of that I am aware.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac pats Teal'c on the shoulder and turns to
     walk away. He stops and turns back to look at
     Teal'c.

  BRA'TAC
     The Council will preside from the new Jaffa
     homeworld, where a great city is to be erected, a
     haven for all those who have chosen freedom. Here,
     on the holy ground of Dakara.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac leaves.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting in the booth, looking around.
     Jim gets up from the counter, holding a newspaper,
     and walks over to Daniel.

  JIM
     Hey, I know you.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim points at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Really?

  JIM
     Yeah. The guy from the paper, Doctor Daniel
     Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim puts the paper down on the table, pointing to
     an article. The newspaper is called The Ascended
     Times and the leader is entitled "Jackson Still
     Undecided", with a large photo of Daniel. Daniel
     looks at the headline, then back up at Jim.

  JIM
     It's okay, keep it. I'm done.

  DANIEL
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     At the bottom of the front page of the paper,
     another headline reads "Anubis plans to retake
     Dakara", with the additional headers of "Exclusive
     information on his quest to destroy all life in
     the Milky Way galaxy" and "He's back again and
     he's badder than ever." Other headlines read,
     "Astral diner to be given infinite status",
     "Wraith on their way to Atlantis", "Yoga, Not the
     path to enlightenment", "Ethereal awareness
     seminar to be held in Talnak Quadrant." Daniel
     reads the Dakara headline, then looks up,
     frowning.


LOCATION--SGC MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Jacob are sitting at a table, eating.

  CARTER
     So, you gonna visit Mark and the kids this trip?

  JACOB
     Tomorrow.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob smiles at Carter.

  CARTER
     Is everything okay?

  JACOB
     I'm just not very hungry.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob puts down his cutlery.

  CARTER
     You've been pretty quiet.

  JACOB
     I'm fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob picks up a bottle of water and sips from it.

  CARTER
     Dad...

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob smiles.

  JACOB
     What?

  CARTER
     It's been two hours since Pete left, you haven't
     said a word.

  JACOB
     I did so.

  CARTER
     'He seems nice'?

  JACOB
     I believe that's three words.

  CARTER
     I'm gonna marry him.

  JACOB
     I know. I just met him. What do you want me to
     say? I know how happy he makes you. That's all
     that matters to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods slightly.

  CARTER
     Okay.

  JACOB
     Selmak really liked him.

  CARTER
     Selmak?

  JACOB
     Yeah, and he's a great judge of character.

  CARTER
     Well, okay.

  JACOB
     Look, Sam, I'm tired. It's been a long day. I
     think I'm gonna turn in early.

  CARTER
     You sure nothing else is wrong?

  JACOB
     Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.

  CARTER
     Goodnight.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob gets up and Carter watches him as he leaves.
     She looks concerned.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOUSE DAY


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOUSE--BEDROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The phone rings and a hand searches on the bedside
     table and the floor for the phone. O'Neill, in
     bed, picks up the phone and turns it on.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     He is obviously still half asleep.


LOCATION--SGC LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is on the phone, Teal'c standing behind
     her.

  CARTER
     Sorry to wake you, Sir. Teal'c's back and it
     sounds like we have a problem.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOUSE--BEDROOM

  O'NEILL
     I knew it. Alright, I'll be there as soon as I
     can.

  ANNOTATION
     He switches the phone off and drops it to the
     floor.

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) Crap.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits up, turning to Kerry who has just woken.
     She stretches up against him as he places his hand
     on her head.

  KERRY
     What was that?

  O'NEILL
     Trouble in Jaffa-land.

  ANNOTATION
     Kerry groans.

  O'NEILL
     Gotta go.

  ANNOTATION
     Kerry nods. O'Neill places his hand on the side of
     her face.

  O'NEILL
     Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leans down to kiss her. He then gets up
     and Kerry looks at him as he walks away.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is reading the paper as Oma comes over to
     place a plate of waffles on the table. He shows
     her Dakara headline in the paper.

  DANIEL
     You know about this?

  OMA
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     And you're not going to do anything about it?

  OMA
     You know I can't.

  DANIEL
     Well, I'm certainly not going to just sit here and
     let this happen.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stands and walks away from the table

  OMA
     You can't leave, you're not ascended yet.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stops and turns back to face Oma, obviously
     not happy.

  OMA
     You walk through that door, you're choosing the
     alternative.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at the door.

  DANIEL
     You're saying I'll be dead.

  OMA
     Pretty much.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma grimaces and nods her head.

  DANIEL
     Okay. Ascend me.

  OMA
     It doesn't mean you'll be able to help your
     friends. You know the rules.

  DANIEL
     Yes, but once I'm ascended, I can choose to take
     human form again, just like last time.

  OMA
     Technically, yes, but you can't take that paper
     with you. You won't have any of the knowledge that
     you've gained here, and good luck ever ascending
     again. I'm certainly not going to help you a third
     time.

  DANIEL
     So you're saying I can know Anubis is plotting to
     destroy all life in the galaxy and all I can do
     about it is stay here and contemplate my own
     enlightenment?

  OMA
     You can eat your waffles.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma walks away. Daniel sighs.

  DANIEL
     (loudly) No syrup?

  ANNOTATION
     He walks up to the counter and sits next to a
     woman eating pancakes.

  DANIEL
     Hi, how's it going? I'm Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up the paper with his picture on the
     front page. The woman ignores him. He sets the
     paper down on the counter.

  DANIEL
     Sorry to bother you, I just wanted to know if I
     could borrow your syrup.

  ANNOTATION
     The woman turns a page of a book she's reading.

  DANIEL
     Although technically, I know it's not going to be
     borrowing, 'cos I'm not actually going to give
     back what I've used.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel smiles then grimaces. The woman continues
     to ignore him. Daniel sighs.

  DANIEL
     Enjoy your meal.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs the paper, gets up and walks over to a
     group of three men at a booth. He slaps the paper
     down on the table.

  DANIEL
     Hi guys! How's it going?

  ANNOTATION
     The men ignore him. Daniel waves his hand in front
     of one of them. Oma walks up to him.

  OMA
     They're not going to talk to you.

  DANIEL
     Why not? Who are they?

  OMA
     Others. You're not one of them yet.

  DANIEL
     You mean Ancients?

  OMA
     A couple of them.

  DANIEL
     What are they doing here?

  OMA
     Watching.

  DANIEL
     Me.

  OMA
     Me too. I told you before, they're always
     watching.

  ANNOTATION
     She holds up a jug of syrup.

  OMA
     You wanted some motor oil?

  ANNOTATION
     She hands the syrup to him and walks away.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac, Teal'c, O'Neill, Jacob and Carter are
     sitting around the table.

  O'NEILL
     I still wish you guys had blown that thing up when
     you had the chance.

  CARTER
     We had to at least be sure that all the
     Replicators really were eliminated.

  JACOB
     And even though we apparently did get rid of them
     all in this galaxy, there may still be more
     elsewhere that could be a threat again.

  CARTER
     So, we wanted to try to figure out how the device
     worked in case we ever needed something like it
     again.

  O'NEILL
     Great. Well, now the Jaffa have something that can
     blow up the entire universe with the push of a
     button.

  BRA'TAC
     The Jaffa will defend Dakara with their lives.

  O'NEILL
     You want to explain to me why they don't want to
     wreck it?

  BRA'TAC
     The ruins at Dakara have become a symbol of
     freedom.

  TEAL'C
     Much more, the Jaffa believe that the device's
     power helped free them, by destroying the
     Replicators. They also believe that controlling
     this power will help ensure their freedom in the
     future.

  O'NEILL
     And get them virtually anything they want.

  BRA'TAC
     The Jaffa would never use it to that end.

  JACOB
     Jack is right. No-one should have that kind of
     power at their disposal.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac sighs. Carter's mobile rings. She moves
     quickly to answer it, slightly embarrassed.

  CARTER
     Sorry! I thought I'd turned it off.

  ANNOTATION
     She checks the display, turns it off, then
     grimaces. She puts the phone back in her pocket.

  O'NEILL
     So, we're all in agreement? One way or another,
     it's got to go. Correct?

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you.

  BRA'TAC
     If you are suggesting we destroy this device
     against the wishes of the High Council, I must
     point out that would not be a good first step in
     relations between the Tau'ri and the newly formed
     free Jaffa nation.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Jacob.

  O'NEILL
     Why don't you do it? They already hate the Tok'ra.

  JACOB
     To be honest, a plan may already be in the works.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Bra'tac look at each other, unhappy.

  JACOB
     But as you know, Selmak and I aren't fully in the
     loop any longer.

  O'NEILL
     Mm.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman enters. He stands behind O'Neill and
     clears his throat. O'Neill turns to look at him.

  O'NEILL
     Yes?

  HARRIMAN
     Sorry to interrupt, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Carter.

  HARRIMAN
     Colonel? There's a call for you. Apparently it's
     urgent.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman leaves as O'Neill turns to look at
     Carter, who nods slightly, looks at the others,
     then gets up. She is obviously embarrassed.

  CARTER
     (quietly) Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up, walks to a desk and picks up the
     phone.

  CARTER
     (into phone) Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Carter and raises his eyebrows.

  BRA'TAC
     Teal'c and I have arranged another meeting of the
     Jaffa Council.

  TEAL'C
     Our hope is to continue strengthening the bond
     between previously warring Jaffa by focusing on a
     common enemy.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks over at Carter, who is standing with
     her back to the room, still talking into the
     phone. She turns to look at the others around the
     conference table.

  CARTER
     (into phone) Yeah, I know, it's just that it's not
     a good time right now.

  TEAL'C
     There are still many Goa'uld that remain a threat.

  CARTER
     (into phone) I know, I'm sorry. I don't know, it
     could be an hour, it could be all day. Yeah, okay.
     Yeah, me too. Bye.

  ANNOTATION
     She hangs up the phone then turns back to the
     table.

  CARTER
     Sorry about that, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Emergency?

  ANNOTATION
     All the men at the table have stood up.

  CARTER
     No, no. Just a misunderstanding.

  JACOB
     Hey, weren't you supposed to meet Pete at the
     florist this morning?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks up as Carter glares at Jacob.

  CARTER
     (through gritted teeth) No...Dad.

  JACOB
     No, I'm sure that's what you said. For the
     wedding.

  CARTER
     (through gritted teeth) I know!

  ANNOTATION
     She shakes her head at him.

  O'NEILL
     Go ahead, Carter. It's supposed to be your day
     off, anyway.

  CARTER
     It's okay, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c and Bra'tac are meeting with the Jaffa.
     There's nothing to do around here. Go pick
     flowers!

  ANNOTATION
     He smiles at her and leaves the room, while Carter
     sighs and glares at Jacob.

  JACOB
     What?


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Oma walks over to Daniel's booth with a jug of
     coffee. Daniel, head resting on his hand, is
     reading the paper.

  OMA
     More coffee?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks up.

  DANIEL
     Sure.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma fills his mug.

  DANIEL
     Can you sit a minute?

  OMA
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma sits at the table.

  OMA
     Ooh... how am I supposed to put it? 'Man, are my
     dogs, tired.'

  DANIEL
     That's good.

  OMA
     How are your waffles?

  DANIEL
     Best I ever had. Can you tell me why you stopped
     me from killing Anubis the last time I was
     ascended?

  OMA
     Because if I didn't stop you, the Others would
     have. And they wouldn't have been as nice about
     it.

  DANIEL
     You mean, they wouldn't have erased my memory and
     left me naked on a planet?

  OMA
     That was your choice.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel simply looks at Oma.

  OMA
     Okay, maybe not the naked part.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel smiles slightly.

  OMA
     But I didn't totally erase your memory even though
     I was supposed to.

  DANIEL
     There... okay. Why is it okay to break some rules,
     and not others?

  ANNOTATION
     Jim enters the diner, whistling. He has another
     newspaper.

  DANIEL
     Look, if you knew I had a problem following the
     rules the last time, why offer me ascension again?

  ANNOTATION
     Oma is watching Jim as he walks to the counter and
     sits down. He is still whistling, loudly.

  OMA
     Because I didn't want to see you die without at
     least giving you a second chance. Look, I have
     trouble following the rules. I'm not really
     supposed to help people ascend. You're supposed to
     do it on your own.

  DANIEL
     But you do it.

  OMA
     I walk the line. Believe me, I crossed it a few
     times and paid for it dearly.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma glances at Jim, briefly.

  OMA
     My point is, you just need to be willing to put
     your prior human existence into the proper
     context.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim is still whistling.

  OMA
     Sorry, I've got to get back to work.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up and grabs the coffee pot. She walks
     past Jim and around the counter.

  JIM
     Coffee, please.


LOCATION--PETE'S CAR--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is in the passenger seat of the car, with
     Pete driving. She gazes out of the window, looking
     pensive.

  PETE
     Chocolate or vanilla?

  CARTER
     I'm sorry, what?

  PETE
     Chocolate or vanilla? The cake. Just in case you
     can't make the meeting with the caterer.

  CARTER
     Oh, I'm sorry. I really do want to be a part of
     this.

  PETE
     I hope so. It's your wedding too.

  CARTER
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete grins.

  PETE
     I realise this must be weird for you. Worrying
     about place settings when we could be destroyed by
     aliens at any minute.

  CARTER
     A little,

  PETE
     We're not about to be destroyed by aliens, are we?

  CARTER
     No.

  PETE
     Cos, you seem a bit distracted.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry.

  PETE
     So, your Dad like me?

  CARTER
     Of course! Why wouldn't he?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks away and down.

  PETE
     Tough guy to read.

  CARTER
     You just have to get to know him.

  PETE
     How about Selmak?

  CARTER
     Ah! He thought you were very charming.

  PETE
     For a human.

  CARTER
     Well, generally speaking, that's my type.

  ANNOTATION
     They both smile.

  PETE
     Good. Did I tell you I also have a surprise for
     you?

  CARTER
     No, what is it?

  PETE
     Tricky. You'll see.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles.


LOCATION--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting behind his desk, with Bra'tac
     and Teal'c sitting in front of him.

  BRA'TAC
     The Council remains unwilling to destroy the
     weapon, for fear it will weaken the resolve of the
     Jaffa to stand united against the remaining
     Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     You realise we have to consider that thing a
     threat to our security?

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  BRA'TAC
     The Council recognises the danger and has decided
     to take action by aggressively seeking out and
     killing Anubis. Once that threat has been
     eliminated they will reassess the decision to
     destroy the device.

  O'NEILL
     Well, we don't even know if Anubis can be killed
     yet, do we?

  TEAL'C
     We must not suggest to the Jaffa that he cannot
     be. At the very least, we can eliminate the
     remainder of the forces of Anubis.

  BRA'TAC
     I believe this quest will unite many of the still
     fractured armies by giving them focus on a common
     goal.

  O'NEILL
     Got anything to go on?

  TEAL'C
     Many of the Kull Warriors were killed in battle
     with the Replicators but intelligence gathered
     indicates that Anubis may be marshalling the
     remaining Kull Warriors on Tartarus.

  BRA'TAC
     A pre-emptive strike is being prepared.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pours sugar from a jar into his coffee. He
     turns to see Oma and Jim speaking at the counter,
     Oma gesturing angrily. Oma's words are indistinct.
     Oma walks away from Jim, into the rear of the
     diner. Daniel walks over to Jim, who is stretching
     in his chair. A woman is sitting at the counter
     two seats down from Jim. She is reading a book.

  DANIEL
     Hey.

  JIM
     Hey! Daniel. How's it going?

  DANIEL
     Do we know each other? I feel like I know you.

  JIM
     Call me Jim. We ran into each other last time you
     were ascended.

  DANIEL
     Ah. Nice to meet you, again.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands and Daniel sits between Jim and
     the woman.

  JIM
     Still haven't made up your mind, huh? Death or
     everlasting enlightenment. I don't really see the
     choice, myself.

  DANIEL
     Of course, I don't want to be dead, it's just
     that...uh. Listen, the reason I came over here was
     to ask you... why are you talking to me?

  JIM
     Oh, you mean because these other snobs won't even
     look at you. I'm different, like Oma.

  DANIEL
     Really? Because I kind of have the impression that
     you two don't quite see eye to eye.

  JIM
     What? That little... that was nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim looks quickly around to make sure that no-one
     is listening. He moves closer to Daniel.

  JIM
     (quietly) We both operate somewhat outside the
     normal rules and regulations. Sometimes we
     disagree on how far outside we should go, that's
     all.

  ANNOTATION
     They both look at Oma as she steps up to take
     plates away from the food counter.

  DANIEL
     Really?

  JIM
     Yeah. As long as these other guys don't strike me
     down, I figure I'm okay.

  DANIEL
     I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. I
     mean, I... I feel like, if I agree to ascend, I'm
     signing a contract that I don't even know what it
     says. Obviously, I had a little trouble with the
     fine print the last time.

  JIM
     You sure did.

  DANIEL
     You know about that?

  JIM
     It's all out there.

  DANIEL
     I just don't see how I can agree to stand by and
     let Anubis destroy every living thing in the
     entire galaxy.

  JIM
     Yeah, that's a tough one. Speaking of which, have
     you seen the latest?

  ANNOTATION
     Jim slides a newspaper over to Daniel. The
     headline reads "Secret Plan Revealed. Anubis'
     dastardly plot to regain Ancient Weapon of
     Destruction."

  JIM
     He's a crafty one. Really knows the ins and outs
     of the rules.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel continues to read the article.

  JIM
     I give him 3-1 odds to succeed. You want to know
     the irony of it all? That device was originally
     used by the Ancients to create life in the Milky
     Way. Well, recreate it, after the whole plague
     thing. No kidding. Now it all gets undone with the
     push of one button, leaving Anubis to recreate
     things all over to his own liking. There's a waste
     of a million odd years of evolution, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to the Others, seated around the diner.

  JIM
     (yelling) I say someone should really do something
     to stop him!

  ANNOTATION
     The Others ignore him. Jim turns back to Daniel,
     waving his hand at the Others in disgust.

  JIM
     No-one will. Can I get a coffee?


LOCATION--PETE'S CAR

  ANNOTATION
     The car stops outside a house with a For Sale
     sign. Carter steps out, her eyes closed.

  CARTER
     Can I open them now?

  ANNOTATION
     Pete walks around from the driver's side.

  PETE
     Almost.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter shuts the car door. Pete takes her hand and
     takes her forward a few steps.

  PETE
     Okay, now.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter opens her eyes, then looks shocked. Pete
     smiles at her. They are standing outside a large
     house. Pete has his hand on her back.

  PETE
     What do you think?

  CARTER
     Uh, well, uh...

  PETE
     Speechless, huh?

  CARTER
     Yeah. Yeah

  PETE
     Isn't it great? Remember our first night together?
     You described the house you always wanted?

  CARTER
     I can't believe this.

  ANNOTATION
     They start walking towards the house.

  PETE
     The kitchen isn't yellow, but we can paint. 'Come
     on, I'll show you.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete walks on, leaving Carter in the middle of the
     lawn.

  PETE
     And you're not gonna believe the back yard. The
     dog's gonna love it.

  CARTER
     Dog? Oh.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is still reading the paper.

  DANIEL
     This is bad.

  JIM
     Yeah. This pie is great, and there's nothing to
     wash it down with.

  ANNOTATION
     He upends his empty mug.

  DANIEL
     Is there anything you can do to stop Anubis? I
     mean, you did say someone should do something.

  JIM
     I did, didn't I. Well, as far as what can be done,
     it's kind of complicated.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, so Oma tells me.

  JIM
     Yeah, well, I don't think she's told you
     everything.

  DANIEL
     What does that mean?

  JIM
     I'm saying...

  ANNOTATION
     Jim looks uncomfortable.

  JIM
     I've already said too much.

  DANIEL
     No, you haven't. In fact, you've hardly said
     anything at all.

  JIM
     You gave up eternal enlightenment, all the
     knowledge and power of the universe. Why do you
     think you did that?

  DANIEL
     To fight for humanity, any way I could.

  JIM
     Yes, very big of you. You rejected everything Oma
     offered you, and now she just gives you another
     chance? Based on the goodness of her heart?

  DANIEL
     Well, that is the point isn't it? I mean, she is
     ascended, she is good.

  JIM
     Sure, best intentions.

  DANIEL
     Do you know what happened between me and Oma? Why
     did I choose to take human form again?

  JIM
     You should ask Oma.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sighs.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOUSE--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is sitting in her car staring at the house.
     She sighs, then gets out and walks towards the
     house. O'Neill is in the backyard, barbecuing.
     Carter walks around the corner of the house.

  CARTER
     Hi, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Carter!

  CARTER
     Look, I'm sorry to bother you at home like this,
     but um...

  O'NEILL
     How did you know I was here?

  CARTER
     I saw the smoke.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill wipes his sweater and face.

  CARTER
     Look, is this okay? I mean, I could have called
     first.

  O'NEILL
     No, yeah. I mean, it's fine. So, um... what brings
     you to this neck of the woods on such a fine day,
     in my backyard?

  CARTER
     Well, actually, I've... ummm...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter clears her throat.

  CARTER
     I've been sitting in your driveway for the last
     ten minutes, trying to work up the nerve to come
     and talk to you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at her, eyebrows raised.

  CARTER
     The truth is, I've been trying to work up the
     nerve for a lot longer than that.

  O'NEILL
     Oh?

  CARTER
     Pete put a down-payment down on a house.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that's great!

  CARTER
     It's a beautiful house.

  O'NEILL
     But...

  CARTER
     The... the truth is, I'm having second thoughts
     about the wedding.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks surprised.

  O'NEILL
     Why?

  CARTER
     See, the thing is, the closer it gets, the more I
     get the feeling that I'm making a big, huge
     mistake.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, looking slightly uncomfortable, glances
     into the house.

  O'NEILL
     Look, Carter, I don't know what...

  CARTER
     I'm sorry to bother you with this, but uh, see,
     there's actually a very good reason that I'm
     bothering you with this, and if I don't tell you
     now, I might never...

  ANNOTATION
     The back door opens and Kerry Johnson comes out of
     the house.

  KERRY
     Jack, I looked everywhere, but I could not fi...

  ANNOTATION
     Kerry sees Carter, who looks embarrassed. She
     turns to look at Kerry. They both smile politely
     at each other.

  KERRY
     Colonel Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures at Kerry.

  O'NEILL
     Miss Johnson.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I..I didn't...

  O'NEILL
     We were just meeting here, in my backyard on this
     fine day, to discuss the state of affairs.

  KERRY
     Well, this is awkward.

  CARTER
     Ya think?

  KERRY
     Jack didn't want anyone at the SGC to know
     about... us.

  CARTER
     No! Look, I..I...uh...I'm sorry, this is my fault,
     I really, I shouldn't have come by unannounced
     like this.

  KERRY
     Well, you know, now that the cat's out of the bag,
     you're here, why don't you just stay? I'm sure
     there's enough charred meat on the grill for all
     three of us.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures at Kerry with a burnt sausage.

  CARTER
     No, thank you, I um...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter's phone rings. She takes it off her belt
     and checks the display.

  CARTER
     It's the SGC.

  ANNOTATION
     She answers the phone as Kerry walks over to
     O'Neill, who offers her a beer. They look at each
     other, before turning to look at Carter.

  CARTER
     Colonel Carter. What? When? Okay, I'm on my way.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter switches off her phone then turns to
     O'Neill and Kerry.

  CARTER
     I gotta go. It's my Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     She runs down the steps and around the corner,
     O'Neill and Kerry looking after her. They turn to
     each other, frowning.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting at the counter reading the
     Ascended Times. Oma walks behind the counter and
     comes up to Daniel.

  OMA
     Well, you can't stay here forever, you know.
     Actually, I suppose you could, I just don't know
     why you'd really want to. Except for the great
     service.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns to get the coffeepot refills his mug.

  DANIEL
     Look, obviously I don't want to just die. Don't
     suppose there's any other options?

  OMA
     I can't get into it. What's stopping you from
     ascending?

  DANIEL
     I don't know.

  OMA
     Must be something holding you back, making you
     doubt yourself.

  DANIEL
     Maybe it's not me I'm doubting.

  OMA
     Look, whether you choose to accept living on a
     higher plane of existence has nothing to do with
     me or anything that I can or can't tell you. It's
     all up to you.

  DANIEL
     But there is something you're not telling me.

  OMA
     Is that what Jim said? You shouldn't be listening
     to him.

  DANIEL
     Why not?

  OMA
     Because.

  DANIEL
     Good answer.

  OMA
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Oma smiles slightly and walks away.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks into the infirmary.

  CARTER
     Dad?

  ANNOTATION
     She walks up to a bed. A nurse, who was standing
     at the bedside, leaves.

  JACOB
     I'm sorry, kiddo. We both are.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is sitting up in the bed.

  CARTER
     About what? What's going on?

  JACOB
     I don't want to ruin everything like this.

  CARTER
     Dad?

  JACOB
     It's Selmak. He's dying.

  CARTER
     Oh, my God, I'm sorry!

  JACOB
     It's okay. He's okay. He led a pretty full life.

  CARTER
     I didn't live with Jolinar that long, but I think
     I have some idea of what it's like.

  JACOB
     Well, this is a little different, Sam. As you
     know, when a Tok'ra symbiote dies, they can
     prevent their host from dying, as Jolinar did with
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  JACOB
     The problem is, that last selfless act requires a
     certain amount of energy and a conscious effort.

  CARTER
     What are you saying?

  JACOB
     By all rights, Selmak should have been dead weeks
     ago. I wouldn't let him go. I thought we needed
     him, that I needed him to help you stop the
     Replicators.

  CARTER
     Dad?

  JACOB
     He hung on as long as he could. Then he slipped
     into a coma just after we activated the weapon on
     Dakara.

  CARTER
     You've known all this time, since then?

  JACOB
     I didn't want to spoil your wedding. Now, I
     thought we could make it.

  CARTER
     (emotionally) We?

  JACOB
     He's barely alive. I'm gonna die with him, Sam.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter begins to cry.


LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting at the counter. Jim walks up and
     sits next to him. He looks around.

  JIM
     Where is she?

  DANIEL
     I don't know. Off doing whatever it is she does
     when she's not here.

  JIM
     You ask her?

  DANIEL
     Yep.

  JIM
     Wouldn't tell you.

  DANIEL
     No.

  JIM
     Had to find out for yourself last time, too. Man,
     were you pissed.

  DANIEL
     About what? Tell me.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim looks around the diner then leans towards
     Daniel.

  JIM
     What do you know about Anubis?

  DANIEL
     I know he's half ascended, whatever that means.

  JIM
     There are many planes of existence, between human
     existence and ascension. Basically, the Others use
     their collective powers to keep him from affecting
     anything on a grand, cosmic level.

  DANIEL
     But it's okay for him to destroy an entire galaxy.

  JIM
     It's okay for him to do anything he could have
     done, back when he was a regular, old Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     I see. What does this have to do with Oma?

  JIM
     Goa'ulds are bad. Anubis is as bad as they come.

  DANIEL
     And?

  JIM
     And?

  DANIEL
     And ascension requires that someone be pure of
     spirit. One must be good to the very core to
     achieve enlightenment. So how does someone like
     Anubis ascend?

  JIM
     Now he's getting it!

  DANIEL
     Oma helps people ascend but she'd never help
     somebody like Anubis!

  JIM
     Maybe not on purpose.

  DANIEL
     Are you saying he tricked her somehow?

  JIM
     Rule number one! No lone ascended being shall help
     a lower, ascend! Lowers are what we call humans
     and such. If you deserve to be here you should be
     able to get here on your own. If there's an
     exception, for whatever reason, a majority vote by
     the collective can get you in. But Oma thinks she
     knows better, and she's taken her licks for it. I
     admit for the most part, she's brought good people
     onboard, but as the old saying goes, nobody's
     perfect. Not even us higher beings.

  DANIEL
     Oma helped Anubis ascend.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim clicks his fingers and points at Daniel. Oma
     walks up to them, angry.

  OMA
     (to Jim) Get out. Get out, now.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim turns to her, than looks at his watch.

  JIM
     Oh, look at the time. Gotta go kid, business to
     attend to. It was nice talking to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim pats Daniel's leg, stands and puts on his
     jacket. He glances at Oma then walks away,
     whistling. Oma turns and glares at him as he
     leaves the diner. She turns back to look at Daniel
     who is looking at her, uncertain.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is sitting at Jacobs bedside, holding his
     hand.

  CARTER
     A number of the Tok'ra have responded. They want
     to pay their respects.

  JACOB
     They can come.

  CARTER
     I can't believe there's nothing they can do. They
     can remove a Goa'uld. In the last few years you've
     almost perfected the process of saving the host.

  JACOB
     That process instantly kills the symbiote before
     it releases toxins. It's too late for that, Sam.
     I'm sorry. I hate to do this to you, but I should
     have been dead four years ago. Since then, I've
     been all over the galaxy. I've done things most
     men never dream of.

  CARTER
     I've heard that before.

  JACOB
     I just want to know you're gonna be happy.

  CARTER
     I am.

  JACOB
     Don't let rules stand in your way.

  CARTER
     What are you talking about?

  JACOB
     You joined the Air Force because of me.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles.

  CARTER
     I love my job.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob nods and puts his hand on her cheek.

  JACOB
     You can still have everything you want.

  CARTER
     I do, Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob sighs and looks at her fondly. Carter holds
     one of his hands in both of hers.

  CARTER
     Really.

     O'Neill is sitting at his desk, looking pensive.
     Kerry walks up, knocking at the door. He turns to
     look at her and she walks in to the office.

  KERRY
     How's Colonel Carter's father?

  O'NEILL
     It doesn't look good.

  KERRY
     Sorry to hear that.

  ANNOTATION
     She closes the corridor door.

  O'NEILL
     Closing the door.

  KERRY
     Yeah, deeply symbolic.

  O'NEILL
     Really?

  ANNOTATION
     Kerry sighs, smiling slightly at O'Neill.

  KERRY
     I really like you. We're good together.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stands.

  O'NEILL
     Yes. We are. But...

  KERRY
     You have issues. It's okay, we all do. There's
     just one big one in particular that I don't think
     I can love with... live with. I need to get out
     before I get more involved. We can still work
     together, can't we? I'd hate to have to ask for
     reassignment. This is really important to me. We
     agreed this would never affect the job.

  O'NEILL
     We did.

  KERRY
     Good.

  ANNOTATION
     Kerry turns and walks to the door.

  KERRY
     You know, there's just one thing I don't
     understand.

  O'NEILL
     Just one?

  KERRY
     Is the Air Force the only thing keeping you two
     apart? Rules and regulations? Because if it is,
     you're making a very big mistake.

  O'NEILL
     And you know what I should do?

  KERRY
     Retire.

  O'NEILL
     Again.

  KERRY
     Don't get me wrong, you're considered invaluable
     to the program by the Pentagon, but the President
     has appointed a civilian to run the SGC before.
     Just a thought.

  ANNOTATION
     Kerry leaves. O'Neill looks after her, pensive.

LOCATION--REBEL MOTHERSHIP

  BRA'TAC
     The time has come for this ancient warrior to
     fight one final battle.

  TEAL'C
     I think not, old man. This victory will present us
     with many new challenges that will require your
     wisdom and sound judgement.

  BRA'TAC
     What our people will require is a youthful, vital
     leadership, and that is something others are
     better suited to provide.

  TEAL'C
     You are only as old as you believe yourself to be.

  BRA'TAC
     Talk to me in fifty years.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed I will.

LOCATION--DINER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Oma are sitting in a booth

  DANIEL
     So it's true.

  OMA
     He tricked me.

  DANIEL
     How? You couldn't tell?

  OMA
     No. He must have found some old, Ancient research
     on ascension. When he came to Kheb he knew what he
     was doing. When I realised the horrible mistake
     that I had made I tried to undo it, but I
     couldn't. That's when the Others stepped in.

  DANIEL
     I don't understand. They only sent him halfway
     back. Why not all the way?

  OMA
     It's complicated.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, what isn't around here?

  OMA
     They warned him. He wasn't allowed to use any
     knowledge or power, unless he otherwise would have
     gained it as a Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     I don't understand. They let him wreak havoc. They
     don't care if he destroys all life in the galaxy?
     Life, they themselves, created.

  OMA
     They haven't stopped me from continuing my work.
     I've tried to make up for it, help when I can.

  DANIEL
     It's your punishment. You're forced to watch,
     powerless to interfere, and let Anubis do whatever
     he wants, just to punish you.

  OMA
     I told you before. The galaxy you're from, the
     plane of existence, is so small and insignificant
     compared to the rest of the universe.

  DANIEL
     I don't care. It's wrong.

  OMA
     That's what you said last time.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gets up from the booth and faces the
     Others.

  DANIEL
     (loudly) Excuse me! Isn't it enough, already? I
     mean, a whole galaxy of innocent people, enslaved
     and tortured for generations, now on the verge of
     being destroyed, for nothing? For what? For one
     mistake a good person made trying to do a good
     thing. Come on, the least you could do is listen
     to me. That can't be against the grand high
     fallutin' cosmic rules!

  ANNOTATION
     All the diners ignore him. Daniel walks up to a
     man sitting in a booth.

  DANIEL
     (yelling) Hey! I'm talking to you!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel grabs the man around the throat but he
     places his hands in a bright light. Daniel steps
     back.

  DANIEL
     Okay, okay. Well, I know you can hear me. Hasn't
     she suffered enough already? Certainly, enough
     other people have suffered to punish her. Don't
     you think you made your point?

  OMA
     That's the thing, Daniel. They don't. I keep
     breaking the same rule, helping people ascend.
     That's why you're here.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns to face Oma.

  DANIEL
     What if you stopped?

  OMA
     Wouldn't undo the problem. That's why I keep doing
     what I do. Anubis can't be killed, not by you, not
     by me.

LOCATION--ANUBIS' BASE

  ANNOTATION
     The rebel Jaffa have over-run the base.

  BRA'TAC
     He is not here. No-one is here. The defences we
     fought through are automated.

  TEAL'C
     We have been deceived.

  BRA'TAC
     Anubis fed us this intelligence to lure us here.
     Our forces defending Dakara are depleted.

  TEAL'C
     We could not have known, brother.

  BRA'TAC
     You were right old friend. The device of Dakara
     should have been destroyed at all costs.

     Carter is sitting, looking down at Jacob. Two
     Tok'ra are at his bedside, talking to him. O'Neill
     enters the observation room and sits next to
     Carter.

  O'NEILL
     You okay?

  CARTER
     (tearfully) Actually, I'm fine. Good even, strange
     as that sounds. I thought I lost him four years
     ago. Since then we've been closer then we ever
     were my whole life. In a way, Selmak gave me the
     father I never thought I'd know.

  O'NEILL
     Come here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts his arm around her. Carter holds the
     hand around her shoulder.

  CARTER
     Thank you, Sir.

  JIM

  OMA
     Get it yourself.

  JIM
     Don't mind if I do.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away from the booth.

  JIM
     Ooh, hey, Danny-boy, you see the paper?

  ANNOTATION
     Jim places the paper on the counter and walks
     behind it to get the coffeepot.

  DANIEL
     No, what's it say?

  JIM
     The trick worked. Those stupid Jaffa took half
     their ships to hunt down Anubis, meanwhile, his
     army was poised to attack Dakara. The remaining
     rebel Jaffa guarding Dakara are being slaughtered.
     It's only a matter of time before old Anubis gets
     his hands on the weapon.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry, you sound almost happy about that.

  JIM
     Who me?

  DANIEL
     Yeah. What do you have against Oma?

  OMA
     Daniel...

  DANIEL
     No, I want to know. I mean, you're not just
     watching, you're coming in here to rub it in. Why
     are you taking such pleasure in her punishment?

  JIM
     Me? I don't have anything against Oma. I think
     she's great, don't I?

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at Oma who looks down, unhappy.

  JIM
     Hell, she's the one that helped me ascend.

  JIM
     You got it now.

     risk. Don't say I deserve better. Can't get much
     better then you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter shakes her head.

  CARTER
     That's not true.

  PETE
     I wish I could believe this had something to do
     with your father. You needed some time to sort
     things out.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete looks at Carter, who can hardly meet his
     eyes.

  PETE
     I guess all I can say is, I hope you get what you
     want.

  CARTER
     That's it?

  PETE
     (angry) What do you want? You want me to get down
     on my knees and beg?

  CARTER
     God, no, of course not. It's just, I thought you
     would react differently.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete is obviously close to tears.

  PETE
     Bye, Sam.

     Carter enters and walks up to them.

  TEAL'C
     Bra'tac and the remaining rebel ships will not
     arrive in time. Anubis now controls the weapon.

  O'NEILL
     Well, then we find the biggest damn nuke we can
     and we shove it right through the gate. Now.

  TEAL'C
     Anubis will certainly have the gate shielded. The
     nuke will not arrive in one piece.

  CARTER
     If we can dial the Alpha site we may be able to
     prevent the weapon from connecting a wormhole to
     either planet. It may only buy us the thirty eight
     minutes that the gate...

     Well, got to go.

  ANNOTATION
     Jim waves at Daniel and Oma. Daniel looks to Oma,
     who simply sits there. Daniel launches himself
     from the booth to attack Jim but he only runs
     through him. Daniel stops, confused. He and Jim
     turn to face each other. Jim smirks.

     There's nothing you can do. You don't have the
     power.

  OMA
     But I do.

     Jim turns to face Oma, who rises from the booth. A
     light engulfs her and she changes from the
     waitress uniform into a dress. The Others, sitting
     around the diner, turn to look at her in shock.

  JIM
     You can't kill me either.

  OMA
     I can fight you.

  JIM
     Well, you can't win.

  OMA
     It won't matter, you won't be able to do anything
     but fight me back.

  JIM
     What are you going to do?

  OMA
     Something I should have done a long time ago.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks towards him. Jim looks scared.

  JIM
     Oh no, no. No!

  ANNOTATION
     As Oma walks towards him she raises her hands. Jim
     raises his also, and as the touch they are both
     engulfed in bright light. The light forms into a
     ball which disappears through the ceiling. The
     Others are watching, in as much shock as Daniel.
     Daniel walks to the place where Oma and Jim were
     standing, and looks around in confusion.

LOCATION--SGC COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, O'Neill, Bra'tac and Teal'c are sitting
     around the conference table.

  BRA'TAC
     The Kull warriors became disorganized and
     confused, as though they no longer knew what to
     do.

  TEAL'C
     They no longer had a master to serve.

  BRA'TAC
     After that, they were easily defeated.

  TEAL'C
     Many Jaffa lost their lives at Dakara. Those that
     survived are united as never before. And we are in
     agreement. The weapon must be destroyed.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that's good.

  BRA'TAC
     A new memorial will be erected in its place, so
     that our triumph over the Goa'uld will never be
     forgotten.

  CARTER
     I still don't quite understand what happened. One
     minute Anubis is about to push the button that
     ends all life in the galaxy and the next minute
     he's just... gone.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed, it is a great mystery.

  BRA'TAC
     One can only assume he was vanquished by some
     beings. If not, why would he forfeit the weapon
     and his army.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and O'Neill look at each other.

  CARTER
     You think?

  O'NEILL
     I do.

  CARTER
     It's the only thing that would explain the self
     destruct not going off.

  BRA'TAC
     Of what do you speak?

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill believes that Daniel Jackson was somehow
     responsible.

  DANIEL
     (from nearby, muffled) Nope, it wasn't me.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks up in shock.

  O'NEILL
     Anybody else hear that?

     doorway, where he suddenly stops.

  DANIEL
     Don't! Don't come in!

  O'NEILL
     Woah, hey there.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks around and pulls down the SGC flag,
     holding it to Daniel who is out of sight. Daniel
     grabs the flag as O'Neill looks around,
     embarrassed. Daniel walks out of the office, the
     flag draped around his lower half. Carter looks at
     him then turns away, her mouth open in shock.
     Bra'tac and Teal'c stare at Daniel. Bra'tac smiles
     and nods his head. O'Neill, who has been steadying
     the flagpole, also turns to look at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     It's uh... a long story.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks up, still embarrassed. Daniel turns
     to look at O'Neill, who looks away.


LOCATION--LAKESIDE--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and O'Neill are sitting on a small jetty
     outside a cabin, fishing.

  CARTER
     This is great.

  O'NEILL
     I told you.

  CARTER
     Can't believe we didn't do this years ago.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, well, let's not dwell.

  CARTER
     There are no fish in this pond are there?

  O'NEILL
     Nope.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter laughs. Daniel and Teal'c walk around the
     side of the cabin, carrying a cooler, two chairs
     and two fishing rods. They walk up to the grass,
     next to the jetty and start to set up the chairs.

  O'NEILL
     Nice.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes beers to O'Neill and Carter as Teal'c
     sits.
