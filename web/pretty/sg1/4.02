LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is exiting an elevator wearing civilian
     clothing. Suddenly the alarms go off and everyone
     starts running

  TECHNICIAN
     (on intercom) Unscheduled offworld activation.

  ANNOTATION
     A group of soldiers run past O'Neill.

  SERGEANT
     Move, move, move, move, move!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill heads for the control room.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Armed guards stand ready at the base of the Gate.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and a technician are sitting at the
     computers as O'Neill walks up to them.

  CARTER
     I still can't make it out. Try to filter out the
     subspace RF interference.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     Colonel! Sir, this is the fifth incoming wormhole
     in the last hour and a half...

  O'NEILL
     All right, I'm here two hours early. When did you
     get here?

  CARTER
     I haven't left yet.

  O'NEILL
     Didn't I order you to get a life?

  CARTER
     Yes sir, you did, but this is a...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel runs in. He is in uniform too and obviously
     hasn't left either. O'Neill looks at him.

  DANIEL
     (out of breath) I just heard...they sent a radio
     signal this time?

  CARTER
     Yeah, but the frequency they're using is being
     distorted just outside the range of our equipment.
     We're trying to make the adjustment.

  ANNOTATION
     A computer screen shows very large frequencies.

  O'NEILL
     What are you doing here?

  DANIEL
     Someone's trying to contact us. How often does
     that happen?

  ANNOTATION
     The computer readout calms down.

  TECHNICIAN
     We can receive now, Major.

  CARTER
     Ok, pipe it through the speakers and try to match
     it so we can transmit back from our end.

  ANNOTATION
     Static is heard through the radio then it forms a
     normal sounding voice.

  ALAR
     (on radio) I repeat this is Euronda base. Have you
     reached the other side?

  CARTER
     Oh my god!

  ALAR
     (on radio) Felar, if you can hear me please
     respond.

  CARTER
     This is Major Carter of the United States Air
     Force. It is imperative that you send no one else
     through the Gate.

  ALAR
     (on radio) Can anyone hear me? This is Alar.

  TECHNICIAN
     They can't hear you, Major. We still haven't
     matched their frequency.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at O'Neill

  ALAR
     ...Historians believe that this Stargate is a
     portal to the world of our ancestors. Your kindred
     are besieged by a powerful enemy unwilling to
     listen to reason. Our supplies are all but gone.
     Our defenses are on the verge of collapse. Help us
     please!

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of the Stargate shutting down is heard.

  CARTER
     Damn...right there were four offworld activations
     prior to this one and the iris was closed the
     entire time. How many impact events did the
     computer report?

  ANNOTATION
     The technician works at the computer and it
     displays impact signs.

  TECHNICIAN
     Three.

  O'NEILL
     So, three dead.

  CARTER
     (upset) Yes, sir.

  DANIEL
     I'm going to go look up Euronda.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off. They all look upset.

  O'NEILL
     It's not your fault, Carter. Move on.

  CARTER
     (quietly) Yes, sir.

LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Hammond are sitting around the briefing
     table listening to a recording of Alar's
     transmission.

  ALAR
     (recording) Your kindred are besieged by a
     powerful enemy unwilling to listen to reason. Our
     supplies are all but gone. Our defenses are on the
     verge of collapse. Help us please!

  HAMMOND
     All right, assuming they make contact again and
     assuming they transmit the coordinates to their
     world, what kind of help can we seriously offer?

  DANIEL
     Err, food, clothing, medical supplies.

  TEAL'C
     Clearly they seek military assistance above all
     else.

  HAMMOND
     God knows who they may be up against.

  TEAL'C
     They themselves may be Goa'uld. Such a ruse would
     be keeping within their tactics.

  CARTER
     I don't think that's the case, Teal'c.

  DANIEL
     They call themselves 'our kindred'.

  HAMMOND
     Some of whom have already met their deaths against
     a closed iris. That's hardly the ground on which
     to build diplomatic relations.

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of the Gate opening is heard. Alarms go
     off and the technician runs up the stairway.

  TECHNICIAN
     Sir, we have another offworld activation.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and SG-1 head for the control room.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Hammond make their way down the stairway.
     A technician in a lab coat is sitting at the
     computer console.

  TECHNICIAN
     We've made an adjustment to our equipment, Major.
     Two way ommunication shouldn't be a problem this
     time.

  CARTER
     Thank you, sergeant.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits down in the chair vacated by the
     technician in the lab coat.

  ALAR
     (on radio) This is Alar of the nation state of
     Euronda. If anyone can hear me...

  HAMMOND
     Alar, this is General Hammond of the United States
     Air Force. Can you hear me?

  ALAR
     (relieved) Yes and may I say, General, that your
     voice answers our prayers.

  HAMMOND
     We've heard your message and are considering your
     request for help.

  ALAR
     I am prepared to step through the portal
     immediately.

  HAMMOND
     We cannot allow that.

  ALAR
     May I ask why?

  HAMMOND
     We have in place an impenetrable shield called an
     iris that would result in your death.

  ALAR
     Then...the three volunteers we sent through the
     portal?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks down.

  HAMMOND
     There was no way to determine if they were friend
     or foe.

  ALAR
     I see...and that is still the case. Clearly we
     must gain your trust.

  ANNOTATION
     An image of Alar appears on the screens.

  TECHNICIAN
     They're transmitting visual.

  CARTER
     (puzzled) How?

  ALAR
     Now you can see for yourself that we are kindred.

  HAMMOND
     We do.

  ALAR
     There is much my people have to offer in exchange
     for your help. If I could speak with you in
     person...

  HAMMOND
     We need to know more about this enemy you are
     facing.

  ALAR
     We have co-existed on this world for centuries.
     Now they occupy the majority of Euronda's
     landmass.

  O'NEILL
     (to Hammond) That rules out anybody we know.

  CARTER
     How have you managed to survive for so long?

  ALAR
     Our facility is deep underground, protected by
     defense fields, and our weapons technology is far
     superior. But now one or two of their bombers
     penetrate our airspace each day.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel leans over to the microphone.

  DANIEL
     How did you find us?

  ALAR
     We discovered the Stargate while creating the
     tunnels for our defense facilities. There were
     writings on the ancient stones it was buried
     beneath.

  ANNOTATION
     Loud bangs are heard and Alar's transmission
     becomes worse.

  ALAR
     We are under attack. I must return to the war
     room...please help us!

  ANNOTATION
     The attack grows louder and Alar runs off. The
     image in the SGC screens goes off and the Gate
     shuts down.

  DANIEL
     So what do we do?

  TEAL'C
     There is nothing that can be done, Daniel Jackson,
     without the coordinates to their world.

  CARTER
     We've got them. He transmitted them before
     disengaging.

  ANNOTATION
     The display shows the seven symbols programmed
     into the dialing computer.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Hammond are in the briefing room. Daniel
     walks up to the table and sits down. O'Neill is
     distractedly drumming on the table.

  DANIEL
     I know it seems hopeless and I know there are a
     lot of unanswered questions but this is the first
     time that the descendants of Earth have actually
     called home. I mean either we try to do something
     or we let them die.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     It's your call, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel...

  DANIEL
     Now I already know what you're going to say but...

  HAMMOND
     ...You have a go

  DANIEL
     ...From a strictly humanitarian point of view....
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks surprised at Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     We cannot and would not devote the resources to
     turn the tide of world war. However as Dr. Jackson
     points out there are humanitarian concerns. We'll
     start with all of the food and medical supplies
     you can take with you. Major, perhaps...

  CARTER
     We're on it, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up and leaves. Daniel and O'Neill also
     get up. Daniel looks confused and looks about to
     say something but leaves also.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel, humanitarian concerns aside, we may have
     finally met an advanced civilization willing to
     exchange technology to help us defend against the
     Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     My thoughts, sir.

  HAMMOND
     I've already talked to the President and Joint
     Chiefs. If the Eurondan government is open to
     trade you're authorized to negotiate.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill smiles and walks out.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate opens. SG-1 is geared up and ready to
     go. Carter is controlling the MALP as it travels
     up the ramp and through the Gate.

  HAMMOND
     SG-1, you are to report back within 24 hours. If
     you do not your GDO's will be locked out.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel are at the foot of the
     ramp preparing. O'Neill looks at Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     You've got that look.

  TEAL'C
     To which look are you referring, O'Neill?

  DANIEL
     The one that says I have misgivings about this
     mission but deep down I know we're doing the right
     thing?

  O'NEILL
     No, the other one.

  DANIEL
     (surprised) Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks up the ramp followed by the others.


LOCATION--EURONDAN UNDERGROUND FACILITIES

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 step through the Gate. The facilities are
     being attacked. There is debris and dust falling
     from the ceiling. Carter sees Alar on the floor.
     He is groaning and has a cut on his head. She runs
     over to him.

  ALAR
     (weakly) You have come.

  CARTER
     It's Alar, sir, he needs medical attention!

  ANNOTATION
     Another strike hits the facility and debris falls
     onto the DHD. Daniel runs over to Alar followed by
     Teal'c.

  DANIEL
     Teal'c, give me a hand here!

  ANNOTATION
     They help Alar to his feet. As they do this a
     group of armed men and women appear with their
     guns drawn. O'Neill and Carter draw their guns
     also.

  1ST MAN
     Stop!

  FARRELL
     Disarm now! Where did you come from?

  ALAR
     These are our kindred of Earth. They have come to
     save us!

  ANNOTATION
     All lower weapons.


LOCATION--EURONDAN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     A medic is tending to Alar. He is injected with a
     liquid. The others are standing around him. He
     seems much better after the injection. The room is
     quiet and there are no sounds of attack.

  ALAR
     I was on my way to the Stargate to contact you
     again.

  FARRELL
     The defense field was down to a minimum
     sustainable strength.

  ALAR
     I told you our people would come, Farrell.

  FARRELL
     You will win the People's Medal for this.

  O'NEILL
     The bombing's eased up.

  ALAR
     We are far more protected here, where the defense
     field is strongest, than in the tunnels where we
     discovered the Stargate.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks to Alar.

  O'NEILL
     How's your head?

  ALAR
     Well enough to show you what you have come to
     save.

  ANNOTATION
     He stands but is dizzy.

  CARTER
     Take it easy, Alar, you might have a concussion.

  ALAR
     No, our Beta-cantin ensures an immediate recovery,
     Major. I am quite fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c enter followed by a Eurondan.

  TEAL'C
     Supplies are being distributed as we speak.

  DANIEL
     Apparently they need everything.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar stares at Teal'c

  ALAR
     Who is this?

  DANIEL
     Alar, this is Teal'c.

  ALAR
     You are not of their kin?

  TEAL'C
     I am in fact a Jaffa, though like you my ancestors
     are descendants of the Tau'ri.

  DANIEL
     Err, the Tau'ri is Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar looks confused at O'Neill

  O'NEILL
     He's part of our team.

  ALAR
     (seemingly unenthusiastic) Is he? Then...welcome.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head. Alar gestures for the team
     to follow him.

  ALAR
     Come.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk out of the room.


LOCATION--EURONDAN UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     They all walk down the corridor. As Alar passes
     people bow to him.

  TEAL'C
     You appear to be a leader among your people.

  ALAR
     I am accorded the respect of my father. He was
     among our leadership when the war began. Now that
     we are fewer in numbers we each share in the daily
     work.

  DANIEL
     You do know the Stargate is capable of
     transporting your people to other worlds?

  ALAR
     Yes, that seemed apparent.

  DANIEL
     Then why haven't you tried to evacuate through the
     Stargate?

  ALAR
     Because of what I am about to show you.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop outside a large door, which Alar opens.
     They step inside a vast chamber containing many
     occupied stasis pods. SG-1 are amazed.

  CARTER
     They're in stasis.

  ALAR
     Their autonomic functions have been regulated so
     that their hearts beat but once every few minutes.
     We had little choice but to live underground and
     this facility's resources are limited. It was the
     only way to preserve the generation of my father.

  ANNOTATION
     As he is saying this Alar scans through a computer
     screen showing photos and information on the
     people in stasis.

  TEAL'C
     May they be revived again?

  ALAR
     Not until the day we reclaim our world.

  DANIEL
     How many are there?

  ALAR
     Thousands sleep here, thousands more in another
     chamber like this one...Awaiting the end of a war
     that will not end.

  ANNOTATION
     They slowly exit the chamber.


LOCATION--EURONDAN WAR ROOMS

  ANNOTATION
     People are busy manning consoles.

  ALAR
     (gesturing at the room) From this room we conduct
     our national defense.

  CARTER
     For all of Euronda?

  ALAR
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm goes off.

  CONTROLLER
     A single enemy recon drone approaches our air
     space, sir.

  ALAR
     Thank you, controller. (to SG-1) Each station is
     capable of piloting a formation of unmanned
     aerofighters.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar gestures at the people at the flight
     stations. SG-1 gather around a tabletop display

  ALAR
     Because of these men and women, enemy bombers
     rarely return to their homeland.

  TEAL'C
     Most impressive.

  O'NEILL
     What about ground attack?

  ALAR
     The fighters are capable of deterring it but the
     enemy has not risked such an attack in several
     years.

  TEAL'C
     For what reason? You are both outnumbered and
     surrounded. Why would they not press their
     advantage?

  FARRELL
     The atmosphere of Euronda has been poisoned since
     the war began. The surface is unlivable.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks uncomfortable with the conversation.

  DANIEL
     Err...now forgive me if this sounds err...what is
     there left to fight over?

  ALAR
     It will not always be this way. An enemy craft is
     approaching our perimeter. Would any of you care
     to attempt to shoot it down?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks up.

  FARRELL
     The target is merely an unmanned reconnaissance
     drone sent for bomb damage assessment.

  O'NEILL
     Unmanned?

  ALAR
     Think of it as a demonstration, Colonel. Are not
     your people more likely to be forthcoming with
     assistance if we have something to offer in
     exchange?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at O'Neill. He walks over to the
     stations.

  O'NEILL
     Sure.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, Alar and Farrell gather round one of the
     stations as O'Neill sits in it.

  O'NEILL
     So does this thing take quarters?

  ANNOTATION
     The chair he is in lies back and a cover slides
     over his head. The chair then sits up.

  FARRELL
     You will find the weapons system most intuitive.
     The hand controls are secondary. Targeting and
     vectoring occur as a result of direct neural
     interface.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks blankly at Carter.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     Err, it'll do whatever your mind wants it to do,
     sir.

  O'NEILL
     Ah!

  ANNOTATION
     The station activates and a sky view is seen
     inside the station. Lights are pointed at O'Neill

  O'NEILL
     Wow, this thing's fast!

  FARRELL
     You are piloting several aerofighters at once in
     formation.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sees the enemy drone approaching.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah got it, eleven o'clock! It looks like a
     biplane.

  ANNOTATION
     He uses the station to lock onto the drone and
     fires, destroying it.

  O'NEILL
     Nice!

  ANNOTATION
     The station shuts down and O'Neill is released
     from it.

  ALAR
     Well done.

  O'NEILL
     Not bad! (To a neighboring pilot) Not bad for an
     old guy eh?

  ANNOTATION
     The man is unresponsive and just stares into
     space.

  O'NEILL
     (to Alar) What's with him?

  ALAR
     Olan is one of our best pilots, Colonel, but he's
     spent most of his adult life in that chair. Years
     of exposure to the neural interface is damaging.
     Very few of us, including myself, can ever pilot
     again without risking what is happening to Olan.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 look concerned.

  O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

  ALAR
     Rest assured Colonel, your brief exposure will
     cause you no harm. Now come, let us celebrate our
     new alliance.

  ANNOTATION
     They follow him out of the room. O'Neill looks
     back on the vegetative Olan.


LOCATION--UNDERGROUND DINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and the Eurondan leaders are sitting around a
     table with glasses in front of them. A pack of
     opened MRE's is at the side of the table. A
     servant is pouring wine into Alar's cup

  ALAR
     I intended to save this bottle to toast the end of
     the war. May the friendship between our worlds be
     the first step toward that end. To friendship!

  ANNOTATION
     They all raise glasses except Teal'c

  ALL
     (except Teal'c) To friendship.

  ALAR
     (to Teal'c) You did not join in the pledge?

  TEAL'C
     I do not consume alcohol.

  ALAR
     Aha.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar looks uncomfortable.

  FARRELL
     Were you impressed by our weapons system, Colonel
     O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah, we'll take a dozen!

  ANNOTATION
     The Eurondans laugh

  FARRELL
     This food you have brought is most flavorable

  O'NEILL
     (drinking the wine) We can do much better, believe
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes a bite of the Eurondan food. He does
     not seem to like it.

  FARRELL
     You must understand that we have survived on
     hydroponically grown yeasts for many years.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gestures at his food.

  DANIEL
     (with mouthful of food) Is that what this is?

  ANNOTATION
     Farrell nods.

  CARTER
     Your power generation requirements must be
     enormous.

  ALAR
     Do you not utilize controlled fusion on Earth?

  O'NEILL
     Controlled?

  ANNOTATION
     He shakes his head.

  ALAR
     It is a most efficient means of power generation.
     Unfortunately the deuterium oxide fuel we require
     to operate our reactors is now in short supply.

  CARTER
     Heavy water! (To O'Neill) It's like regular water,
     sir, except the hydrogen nucleus contains two...

  O'NEILL
     (annoyed) I know what heavy water is, Major...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks embarrassed.

  O'NEILL
     ...And if that's what the Eurondans need, we'd be
     happy to provide.

  ANNOTATION
     The Eurondans seem excited.

  ALAR
     In return we can teach your people how to
     construct weapons systems such as ours.
     Aerofighters, stasis devices, fusion reactors.

  O'NEILL
     Sounds fair...Carter?

  CARTER
     Medicines.

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah, right. We were very impressed with that
     beta cun...candy stuff.

  ALAR
     Beta-cantin, of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks uncomfortable.

  DANIEL
     Jack?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel?

  DANIEL
     Shouldn't we ask them what they want the heavy
     water for?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, I don't think so.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill stare at each other. O'Neill
     seems annoyed at Daniel.

  ALAR
     The power generated by your heavy water would be
     used to reinforce our defenses, Dr. Jackson.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel doesn't look convinced. He picks up his
     glass for a drink.

  ALAR
     And in due course to strike back at the enemy.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks annoyed with himself and quickly puts
     down his glass.

  DANIEL
     Jack?

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) Daniel, shouldn't we have this
     discussion some other time?

  DANIEL
     No, I don't think so.

  ALAR
     Surely you can understand our desire to end a war
     that has lasted for a generation.

  DANIEL
     No, I do understand that Alar, I do. It's just
     that the Stargate, because it's capable of
     transporting your people to another world
     entirely...

  ALAR
     But I have told you, thousands of our people are
     in stasis.

  DANIEL
     Well, take them out of stasis and find a new home.

  ALAR
     Then what would all this have been for? This is
     our home.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel interrupts him. O'Neill glares at Daniel

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry, I just don't understand why you would
     continue to fight a war when there's another
     choice.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you've heard the man.

  DANIEL
     (to Alar) You said yourself that the atmosphere
     here is poisoned. What is there left to win?

  ANNOTATION
     There is an uncomfortable silence. Farrell looks
     down. O'Neill continues to glare at Daniel.
     Suddenly a vibration starts and an attack is
     heard. The room shakes and dust falls on the
     table. The lights flicker. They all stand. The
     controller enters the room.

  CONTROLLER
     Alar, enemy bombers have penetrated the outer
     perimeter.

  FARRELL
     Defense stations!

  ALAR
     Please excuse us, we'll be in the war room once
     you reach your decision.

  ANNOTATION
     The Eurondans leave SG-1 alone in the room. The
     attack is getting more violent and the room is
     shaking more. Only O'Neill remains seated.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) Next time I tell you to shut up!

  DANIEL
     I didn't hear you tell me to shut up.

  O'NEILL
     (frustrated) Too subtle for ya?

  DANIEL
     Well, for once, yes. Would you hear me out?

  O'NEILL
     Carter, our standing orders, what are they?

  CARTER
     To seek new allies and procure technologies to aid
     in the defense against the Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     And have we carried out those orders?

  DANIEL
     We came here to help them!

  ANNOTATION
     A large blast is heard and the room shakes
     violently.

  TEAL'C
     Is that not what we are doing, Daniel Jackson?

  DANIEL
     No...their whole world is in flames and we are
     offering them gasoline. How is that help?

  TEAL'C
     We are in fact offering water.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) Thank you!

  DANIEL
     I was speaking metaphorically.

  O'NEILL
     Well stop it. It's not fair to Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks up.

  O'NEILL
     The decision's made.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns away to gather his pack. Daniel looks
     angry.

  DANIEL
     This mission has never had anything to do with
     helping them has it? We came here to help
     ourselves!

  O'NEILL
     Carter, take Daniel back and tell Hammond we've
     struck a deal.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks over to Daniel

  DANIEL
     You don't give a damn what's going to happen to
     them. You want their technology and you're taking
     advantage of the situation!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks up. He is angry and walks towards
     Daniel. The overhead attack continues.

  O'NEILL
     Yes I am, Daniel. They're getting something they
     want. We're getting everything that we want! I
     don't have a problem with that. Carter!

  CARTER
     We're on our way, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to leave. O'Neill walks past Daniel.

  DANIEL
     This conversation isn't over!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns around. He walks right up to Daniel
     and gets face to face with him. The tension is
     high.

  O'NEILL
     No you're right, Daniel. It's never over with you.
     It's always the same damn thing!

  DANIEL
     This has got nothing to do with me!

  O'NEILL
     Do you even realize what they're offering?

  DANIEL
     At what price?

  O'NEILL
     (shaking his head) Oh for cryin' out loud!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks away

  DANIEL
     Where are you going?

  O'NEILL
     To see what I can do to help!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c follows O'Neill. Carter stands waiting for
     Daniel who just stands there incredibly angry. He
     eventually walks out past her. She follows.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--DAY


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel walk up the stairs into the
     room.

  CARTER
     I am not defending him, Daniel. I happen to agree
     with him.

  DANIEL
     Well, don't you realize what we would be doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks up to Hammond. Daniel stands by the
     computer consoles not looking at Hammond. Siler is
     also in the room.

  HAMMOND
     Major, Doctor?

  CARTER
     Sir, Colonel O'Neill has negotiated access and
     availability to virtually every advanced Eurondan
     technology. In exchange for an unspecified
     quantity of heavy water.

  HAMMOND
     That's all they want?

  CARTER
     That's all.

  HAMMOND
     What do they want it for?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks up. He is clearly frustrated.

  DANIEL
     Thank you, thank you for asking the question!

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks at Daniel, puzzled.

  CARTER
     As you know sir, heavy water contains deuterium.

  HAMMOND
     Which can be used to make nuclear weapons.

  CARTER
     Yes, but they use it to fuel nuclear fusion
     generators.

  HAMMOND
     Fusion?

  CARTER
     According to Alar, the additional power would be
     enough to stave off defeat.

  HAMMOND
     They're willing to share that technology as well?

  DANIEL
     Of course they're willing, they're desperate.

  CARTER
     Yes sir, everything, and it is incredible. They
     are at least a hundred years ahead of us. Maybe
     even more, but if we don't act soon they are going
     to be overwhelmed.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks to Siler.

  HAMMOND
     Sergeant Siler?

  SILER
     I'll get right on it sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves the control room. Hammond looks at
     Daniel who is clearly unhappy with the situation.

  HAMMOND
     Doctor, you don't approve?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks over to Carter and Hammond.

  DANIEL
     You said yourself that we could not and would not
     devote the resources necessary to win a war.

  HAMMOND
     Obviously I was speaking in terms of committing
     military assets, human life.

  DANIEL
     But there was a moral issue?

  HAMMOND
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     But if we can provide the power of all that and
     more in the form of water then the moral issue
     just evaporates?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Hammond look at Daniel.

  HAMMOND
     (sternly) I shouldn't have to remind you that
     Apophis is alive and at present capable of wiping
     us from the face of this Earth without contest. It
     is the mandate of this organization to make sure
     that this doesn't happen!

  DANIEL
     I understand that, I do.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns around and walks towards the observation
     window into the Gate room. Hammond stares at him.

  DANIEL
     We've only ever seen one side of this. Do we even
     know why they're fighting?

  CARTER
     For their lives!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks back over to Carter and Hammond

  DANIEL
     Yes, yes and I was all for saving those lives. But
     we're about to go way, way, way beyond that. We're
     about to turn the tide of a world war that we know
     nothing about. Against an enemy that we know
     nothing about! Is that the right way to go about
     getting their technology? Yes. But is it the right
     thing to do?

  CARTER
     That's a fair question, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond stops to think.

  DANIEL
     Yes, it is!


LOCATION--EURONDA WAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Alarms are going off and the room is very busy
     with people manning stations. O'Neill and Teal'c
     are standing behind Farrell at the main table.

  FARRELL
     Send the formation to the West. They are massing
     bombers on that front.

  ANNOTATION
     The controller nods in agreement.

  FARRELL
     (to O'Neill and Teal'c) How long?

  TEAL'C
     Major Carter and Daniel Jackson will return as
     soon as they are able.

  FARRELL
     There are too many!

  O'NEILL
     Use a couple more pilots?

  FARRELL
     Yes!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Teal'c and they head to the
     piloting stations.

  CONTROLLER
     (offscreen) Aerofighter squadron vectoring target.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c sit at the stations and begin
     to control them in the attack.

  CONTROLLER
     Enemy bombs incoming. Bearing zero, zero mark
     three.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. I see them.


LOCATION--UNDERGROUND EURONDAN TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Carter have returned through the Gate
     with a small container of deuterium. Alar and
     other Eurondans greet them.

  ALAR
     (looking at deuterium) This is all you were able
     to bring?

  CARTER
     On short notice, yes.

  ALAR
     This much will not last a day!

  CARTER
     There's more coming, we thought it would be best
     to bring what little we could as soon as possible.

  ALAR
     More is on the way, you are certain?

  CARTER
     Much more, yes.

  ALAR
     (to Eurondans) Add the fuel to the reactors
     immediately and set the defense field to full
     power. A demonstration to the enemy, we must show
     them that we are strong once more!

  ANNOTATION
     A large explosion is heard and the tunnel shakes.

  DANIEL
     In the meantime we have questions.

  ALAR
     Yes, yes as soon as the attack is over we will
     provide all that we have promised. Come, it isn't
     safe!

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the tunnel.


LOCATION--WAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c are piloting the fighters.

  CONTROLLER
     Enemy fighters spotted over the city.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, target the lead bomber. I'll take the
     other one.

  TEAL'C
     I have it, O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     We see their view of the fight. The enemy bombers
     are managing to evade them.


LOCATION--EURONDAN DINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Alar, Carter and Daniel enter as the attack rages
     on.

  CARTER
     That one sounded close!

  ALAR
     Directly above us in the old city. Let me show you
     another of the wonders we intend to share with you
     for all you have done.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar touches a wall. It becomes transparent and a
     large field generator is seen slowly turning.

  ALAR
     The field generator is capable of repelling the
     force of many bombs like a great shield. It has
     saved our people from destruction my entire life.

  ANNOTATION
     The generator speeds up slightly; it is loud and
     creaking.

  ALAR
     You see. The fuel you brought has strengthened it
     again.

  CARTER
     How long will that last?

  ALAR
     (sighing) For several hours!

  CARTER
     I'm certain that we'll be able to send more heavy
     water by then.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar looks relieved and nods.


LOCATION--WAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     In the piloting station, O'Neill sees the bomber
     he is chasing dive.

  O'NEILL
     Mine's going for the deck.

  ANNOTATION
     He follows the fighter downwards and eventually
     gets it with a clean shot. The bomber veers
     towards him as it explodes and O'Neill sees that
     there are people inside the enemy plane. He puts
     his hands to his eyes and moans as the station
     disengages.

  TEAL'C
     (alarmed) O'Neill are you all right?

  CONTROLLER
     Enemy bomber destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sits up quickly, very angry.

  O'NEILL
     What the hell was that?

  FARRELL
     The lead aerofighter in your formation struck an
     enemy bomber head on.

  O'NEILL
     I saw people in that thing! You said they were
     unmanned!

  FARRELL
     I said the reconnaissance craft was an unmanned
     drone. It presented an easy target and therefore a
     suitable demonstration. But their bombers are
     manned. You have killed several of our enemy,
     Colonel, and we are grateful.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at O'Neill


LOCATION--EURONDAN DINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and the Eurondans are seated around the
     table. Alar is holding his glass out in
     remembrance

  EURONDANS
     He is remembered.

  ANNOTATION
     They all raise their glasses and drink.

  TEAL'C
     For whom do you pledge this remembrance?

  ALAR
     My father. Through his vision our nation has
     survived.

  TEAL'C
     I see.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Alar stare suspiciously at each other.

  ALAR
     (to O'Neill) It is customary among our people to
     formalize new alliances such as ours. In exchange
     for all our knowledge, technology, medicines,
     Earth will provide us with however much heavy
     water as we require to end this war once and for
     all.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter look at him.

  ALAR
     Do not be alarmed Colonel. Merely three or four
     times that which you have just provided on a daily
     basis.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill) That adds up to several metric tons a
     year, sir.

  ALAR
     It's a small price to pay for what we offer in
     return.

  FARRELL
     Alar, listen.

  ANNOTATION
     They listen but no sound is heard. SG-1 look
     puzzled.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  ALAR
     Silence, I hardly recognize it. When at full
     strength our defense field makes us as
     invulnerable as when I was a boy. I propose that
     we write into words what we already share in our
     hearts.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel coughs to interrupt

  DANIEL
     Before we do that I have a question.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks annoyed at him.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill) General Hammond would also like to
     know, sir.

  ALAR
     It's all right, Colonel, I don't mind.

  DANIEL
     How did this war start?

  ALAR
     The first enemy bombs fell on Euronda in a
     surprise attack. I was a boy of nine. I remember
     that night. I remember the floor of the room in
     which my father had sequestered me shook with each
     explosion. I remember knowing that each bomb that
     got through meant that another building, another
     home, another street in the city above me was
     gone. That is how this war began, Doctor.

  DANIEL
     (unconvinced) And for that we have only your word?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks down.

  ALAR
     Three of our best men died attempting to reach
     Earth through your Stargate.

  DANIEL
     That was an accident.

  ALAR
     And we have only your word.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel has no response. Carter looks at him
     uncomfortably.

  O'NEILL
     Any more questions, Daniel?

  DANIEL
     Yes, I'd like to know more about your enemy.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar looks to O'Neill, who shakes his head in
     disbelief at Daniel's actions.

  ALAR
     Is this part of your bargaining process, Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     Not normally!

  ALAR
     What more can we promise than everything we have?

  DANIEL
     Why don't you just answer the question?

  ALAR
     Colonel O'Neill, do we have an agreement?

  O'NEILL
     We do.

  DANIEL
     Jack?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel...shut up!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks up in surprise at these words.

  O'NEILL
     Is that clear enough?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel says nothing. There is an uncomfortable
     silence.

  CARTER
     Sir, if you're going to go back and tell General
     Hammond I would like to stay here and take a look
     at that fusion technology.

  O'NEILL
     Fine!

  ALAR
     It would be my pleasure to show you the process.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets up to leave with Carter. Daniel and
     O'Neill stare coldly at each other.


LOCATION--EURONDAN UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Alar are walking towards the Gate. Alar
     and O'Neill are ahead of the others.

  ALAR
     I understand that you shot down an enemy bomber
     for us Colonel, congratulations. Perhaps you'll
     try your hand at it again?

  O'NEILL
     I don't think so.

  ALAR
     Well, if you are concerned about lives lost,
     remember they are your enemy now. I look forward
     to your return. Which reminds me; perhaps it would
     be best if the Jaffa did not return.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c...why? He hasn't said a word.

  ALAR
     It's not what he said. It's what he is.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop walking by the DHD.

  O'NEILL
     Well he's different, I'll grant you that.

  ALAR
     (smiling) Not...like us.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stares at Alar realizing what he is
     implying.

  O'NEILL
     Right.

  ALAR
     (to Carter) Major Carter, after you.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk off down the corridor. O'Neill stares
     after Alar. He shakes his head. Daniel walks up to
     the DHD and starts dialing home. He doesn't look
     at O'Neill. Halfway through dialing O'Neill grabs
     hold of Daniel'S hand to stop him dialing. Daniel
     looks at him.

  O'NEILL
     We're not going!

  DANIEL
     Why?

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c and I are going to have a look around
     first. You...ask questions.

  DANIEL
     I thought you told me to...

  O'NEILL
     I know what I said, Daniel. It was rude, short
     sighted and I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel scratches his head.

  DANIEL
     Well...uh...thank you for recognizing that.

  O'NEILL
     Now I'm saying this. Go ask questions. Lots of
     questions.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off with Teal'c.


LOCATION--WAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Alar is explaining the fusion reactor to Carter
     around the display table.

  ALAR
     One single fusion reactor is capable of generating
     power to the entire facility. I assume you extract
     deuterium from seawater?

  CARTER
     Yes, 70 percent of the Earth's surface is ocean so
     heavy water extraction shouldn't be a problem.

  ALAR
     Ah...The sea from which we used to extract our own
     heavy water as you call it, is now in enemy hands
     hundreds of miles away. You can see that the
     storage tanks are nearly empty.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows Carter a plan of the facility. She
     studies it and looks puzzled.

  CARTER
     You must have been building this place long before
     the war started.

  ALAR
     The war was inevitable.

  CARTER
     How long did you expect to stay down here?

  ALAR
     Until the air was free from poison...excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away and Carter studies the map more
     carefully.


LOCATION--EURONDAN UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c are walking down it.

  O'NEILL
     So what's your impression of Alar?

  TEAL'C
     That he is concealing something.

  O'NEILL
     Like what?

  TEAL'C
     I am unsure, he is concealing it.

  ANNOTATION
     They come to the door to the stasis chamber and
     use a Zat gun to open the lock. They enter the
     room and O'Neill looks through the computer
     display of the people in stasis. The pictures show
     people all with similar characteristics.

  TEAL'C
     What is it O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     They're the same...every damn one of them is the
     same!


LOCATION--DINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel enters to find Farrell talking to another
     Eurondan

  DANIEL
     Farrell.

  FARRELL
     Doctor.

  DANIEL
     Err, I just thought that since we're going to be
     allies, I thought we should get to know a little
     bit more about our new enemy.

  ANNOTATION
     Farrell looks at the Eurondan man and he leaves
     the room.

  DANIEL
     Ok, err...well you call them 'the enemy'.
     Understandably they are your enemy but they must
     have a name. For example I'm American. My
     grandfather was Dutch. What do you call them?

  FARRELL
     Sometimes we call them breeders.

  DANIEL
     Breeders?

  FARRELL
     How they reproduce, indiscriminately with no
     regard for genetic purity.

  DANIEL
     Really! So basically they come in all shapes and
     sizes?

  FARRELL
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     Colors?

  FARRELL
     Yes!

  DANIEL
     Really!

  ANNOTATION
     He looks shocked.


LOCATION--WAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is still studying the plans on the display
     as Alar enters with a small cylinder. He walks up
     to her

  ALAR
     This storage cylinder contains plans,
     specifications and formulas on which our
     technology is based. Together I am certain we can
     find a means of transferring the information to
     your computers.

  CARTER
     Alar, these pipes extend up from the lowest levels
     right up to the surface.

  ALAR
     Yes.

  CARTER
     But you said the atmosphere was poisoned. It
     doesn't make any sense.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm sounds.

  CONTROLLER
     Enemy bombers approach the perimeter!

  ANNOTATION
     The plans on the display change to a map of
     Euronda.

  ALAR
     Engage them!

  ANNOTATION
     Pilots sit at the piloting stations and engage the
     bombers. The war room becomes a mass of activity.


LOCATION--UNDERGROUND CORIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks up to O'Neill and Teal'c

  DANIEL
     Jack!

  O'NEILL
     What did you find out?

  DANIEL
     They did it. They started the war. I don't know
     how they did it but they did.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk to the war room. Alar looks up as they
     enter.

  ALAR
     Where is the fuel?

  O'NEILL
     There's been a delay.

  ALAR
     (panicked) What sort of a delay? The enemy is
     attacking in force. We need that fuel!

  O'NEILL
     We just have to buy a little time. Teal'c and I
     can help fight them off until it gets here.

  ANNOTATION
     Alar is annoyed but agrees to it.

  ALAR
     Do it!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c walk to the stations and Daniel
     joins Carter around the display table. An alarm
     sounds as O'Neill and Teal'c enter the stations
     and begin piloting.

  O'NEILL
     Stay on my wing, Teal'c.

  CARTER
     (to Alar) It was a preemptive strike. Your enemy,
     when they began bombing they were trying to stop
     you.

  ALAR
     Now is not the time, Major!

  ANNOTATION
     She looks at Daniel, as Farrell enters the war
     room.

  FARRELL
     The defense shield is at minimum sustainable
     strength!

  ALAR
     Transfer energy from the stasis room!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks round to Daniel.

  CARTER
     (to Daniel) The Eurondans built this place long
     before the war started. They planned it from the
     beginning!

  DANIEL
     Right, but how did they expect to win a war from
     underground?

  CARTER
     There are these enormous gas pipes that run from
     holding tanks underneath this facility right up to
     the surface.

  DANIEL
     And the surface is poisoned!

  CARTER
     They didn't just start a war, they were trying to
     exterminate them.

  ALAR
     (interrupting) It was his vision. My father saw
     that breeders were spreading across the face of
     Euronda like a plague, millions of them! We don't
     know how so many of them manage to survive but
     they do in spite of our best efforts. Contact your
     General Hammond; tell him we need that fuel
     immediately!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel look disgusted at him.

  DANIEL
     We're not going to do that!

  ALAR
     (to guards) Arm!

  ANNOTATION
     The guards raise their guns and grab hold of
     Daniel and Carter.

  ALAR
     Contact your General Hammond!

  ANNOTATION
     A large explosion is heard and the room shakes
     violently. Alar grabs the information canister.
     O'Neill and Teal'c are still piloting at the
     stations. O'Neill has the bombers in sight but
     fires instead on the other Eurondan vessels.

  FARRELL
     They're escorting the enemy bombers!

  ALAR
     What?

  FARRELL
     He's attacking our own bombers!

  ALAR
     Stop him!

  ANNOTATION
     The guards try to go for O'Neill. With their
     distraction Carter and Daniel overpower them and
     draw their weapons on Alar and Farrell. O'Neill
     continues to escort the enemy bombers to the
     underground facility. The room shakes violently
     and Alar drops the information canister, smashing
     it. Teal'c gets out of his piloting station as
     Alar draws his gun on O'Neill. Teal'c grabs Alar's
     gun and crushes his hand, sending him to his knees
     in pain. O'Neill pilots his bomber downwards and
     crashes it into the ground above the underground
     facility. The facility shakes violently and part
     of the ceiling collapses. Daniel and Carter stand
     guard at the doorway to the war room as O'Neill
     exits the piloting station. He and Teal'c run to
     the doorway.

  ALAR
     It could have all been yours!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks back at Alar.

  O'NEILL
     I wouldn't follow us if I were you.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 leave the room as it all begins to collapse
     around Alar. Farrell is crushed under some falling
     debris.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 run down the corridor as the whole facility
     is being destroyed. Some Eurondan guards follow
     them.


LOCATION--FIELD GENERATOR VIEWING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Alar looks at the generator, which is rapidly
     failing.

  ALAR
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     He runs out.


LOCATION--EURONDAN GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is dialing home as the rest of SG-1 defend
     their position from the guards firing. The Gate
     opens.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel and Teal'c) Go!

  ANNOTATION
     They go through the Gate. O'Neill and Carter keep
     firing at the Eurondans. They manage to shoot some
     before retreating to the Gate themselves. As they
     reach the Gate, Alar comes after them.

  ALAR
     Wait, wait!

  ANNOTATION
     They stop and look at him. Alar has a look of
     desperation on his face.

  ALAR
     I could teach you everything I know! Just let me
     come with you! Please!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stares at him coldly. He and Carter then
     leave through the Gate.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter comes through the Gate and turns around
     with her gun ready, expecting Alar. O'Neill slowly
     walks through.

  O'NEILL
     Close the iris.

  HAMMOND
     Do it!

  ANNOTATION
     The iris closes behind O'Neill. He drops his hands
     from his weapon and stands staring ahead. Carter
     stares at him. The computer registers an impact on
     the iris. Hammond, Teal'c and Daniel are waiting
     at the bottom of the ramp.

  HAMMOND
     I take it, Colonel, that you were unable to
     procure any of the Eurondan technology.

  O'NEILL
     That's correct, sir.

  HAMMOND
     I'm sorry to hear that.

  O'NEILL
     Don't be!

  HAMMOND
     We'll debrief in one hour.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away.

  O'NEILL
     Yes sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stares at him then walks down the ramp to
     Daniel and Teal'c leaving O'Neill standing on the
     ramp.
