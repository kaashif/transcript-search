Summit Part 1
TEASER

LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A cargo ship and mothership approach two
     motherships. A ring transport takes place between
     the cargo ship an a mothership. A Jaffa walks up
     to a Goa'uld with his back turned to us.

  JAFFA
     Your guest has arrived.

  ANNOTATION
     The Goa'uld turns and we see it is Zipacna. He
     starts talking.

  ZIPACNA
     You are to be congratulated. My sources have
     informed me that you have managed to amass an
     impressive army. In a relatively short amount of
     time.

  ANNOTATION
     We see whom he is talking to. It's Osiris.

  OSIRIS
     I merely took advantage of favourable conditions.

  ZIPACNA
     The old order has fallen. The System Lords are in
     disarray. Opportunities exist but only for those
     who are bold enough to seize them.

  OSIRIS
     (incredulously) What are you proposing? An
     alliance?

  ZIPACNA
     No. I am offering you a position of power in
     exchange for your support.

  OSIRIS
     Osiris serves no one. You, least of all.

  ZIPACNA
     You once served Isis.

  OSIRIS
     She was my queen. She served me.

  ZIPACNA
     (laughs) Interesting. Interesting that you now
     choose a female host. A most attractive one at
     that.

  ANNOTATION
     Osiris turns to leave.

  OSIRIS
     You waste my time.

  ZIPACNA
     You misunderstand. (she stops) I am not asking you
     to serve me. I must regret that I am merely an
     emissary for a much more powerful Goa'uld. One
     whom you once knew well.

  OSIRIS
     (turning back) Of whom do you speak?

  ZIPACNA
     Anubis.

  ANNOTATION
     Osiris looks back at Zipacna, with an almost
     frightened look in her eye.

  OPENINIG CREDITS



LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate spins, and a wormhole establishes.

  CHEVRON GUY
     (off camera) Unauthorised off world activation.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate engages.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, Teal'c and Carter are there. O'Neill and
     Daniel walk in.

  CHEVRON GUY
     Receiving IDC transmission, sir. It's the Tok'ra.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, here we go.

  ANNOTATION
     They all walk down to the Gate room. The Gate
     shuts off and someone walking down the ramp.

  HAMMOND
     Ren Au.

  REN AU
     General Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     This is SG-1.

  REN AU
     I am familiar with all your exploits. (to Carter)
     Your father Jacob sends his regards.

  CARTER
     How is he?

  REN AU
     On a mission at the moment, which is the reason I
     am here. There is a serious situation developing
     regarding the System Lords.

  HAMMOND
     Briefing room.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond escorts Ren Au to the briefing room.
     O'Neill and Daniel are left.

  O'NEILL
     It's always suicide mission this, save the planet
     that. No one ever just stops by to say Hi any
     more.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Ren Au is standing up. SG-1 and Hammond are sat
     around the table.

  REN AU
     The deaths of Cronus and Apophis created a power
     vacuum that the remaining System Lords have been
     trying to exploit. Over the past several months
     they have suffered heavy losses and expended an
     enormous amount of resources fighting amongst
     themselves.

  O'NEILL
     Let the good times roll.

  REN AU
     Unfortunately the good times may be coming to an
     end. They've declared a truce. And now it looks as
     if they are going to have a meeting to discuss the
     establishment of a new order.

  HAMMOND
     So you want to stop them?

  REN AU
     Quite the opposite actually. We want them to meet.
     It'll give us the rare opportunity to strike
     against all of them at once.

  CARTER
     You're talking about taking out the entire Goa'uld
     leadership?

  REN AU
     We are.

  O'NEILL
     Welcome to the dark side.

  REN AU
     This has always been part of our long-term plan.
     We just weren't quite prepared for the opportunity
     to present itself so quickly.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill nods sarcastically.

  DANIEL
     Where exactly is this meeting taking place?

  REN AU
     A space station in the Hasara system. It is
     considered neutral territory. Security will be
     tight, no weapons will be permitted on board and
     access will be by cargo ship only.

  O'NEILL
     Defences?

  REN AU
     Impenetrable.

  TEAL'C
     Could we possibly gain entrance on one of the
     cargo ships?

  REN AU
     They'll be scanned on their approach to the
     station.

  O'NEILL
     Okay. Let's hear it.

  REN AU
     Every System Lord in attendance will be permitted
     to bring one human slave.

  CARTER
     And you want one of us to do it.

  REN AU
     Specifically we need someone who speaks fluent
     Goa'uld.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks at Teal'c.

  REN AU
     Someone who is not Jaffa.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone turns to look at Daniel who looks
     nervously around.

  REN AU
     If you agree to participate, we ask that you come
     to our base on Ravanna tomorrow. Jacob will be
     there, he will tell you all you need to know.
     (pause) It is up to you Dr Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is studying some text. Teal'c walks in.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson?

  DANIEL
     Yeah?

  TEAL'C
     Have you considered the Tok'ra proposal?

  DANIEL
     Yep.

  ANNOTATION
     He does not look up from his study.

  TEAL'C
     If successful, it would deal the Goa'uld a mortal
     blow.

  DANIEL
     Yeah. I realise what's at stake.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson, you have stated many times that in
     circumstances such as this, you would avoid using
     such action if given a better option.

  DANIEL
     Right. You think there's a better way of
     overthrowing the Goa'uld?

  TEAL'C
     I currently have no plan that would accomplish as
     much as the one put forth by the Tok'ra.

  DANIEL
     (thinks about what Teal'c has said for a moment)
     That's why I'm going to do it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-17 have assembled in the Gate room. Lt Elliot
     is there, on his first assignment. SG-1 walk in.

  MANSFIELD
     Ten hut!

  O'NEILL
     At ease. Major.

  MANSFIELD
     Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     I see you drew the short straw.

  CARTER
     Lieutenant Elliot. Finally got your first
     assignment.

  ELLIOT
     Yes ma'am. Be nice to see a little action for a
     change.

  O'NEILL
     It's just your basic off world orientation,
     Lieutenant. There is no action.

  ELLIOT
     Maybe not sir, but I am looking forward to meeting
     the Tok'ra.

  O'NEILL
     You'll get over it.

  ANNOTATION
     They all walk up the ramp.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE


LOCATION--RAVANNA

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob and Aldwin walk up to the Gate as SG-1 and
     SG-17 come through.

  JACOB
     Welcome to Ravanna.

  CARTER
     Hi Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     They embrace.

  JACOB
     It's good to see you, Sam. Jack, how are you?

  O'NEILL
     Kinda curious.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands, and O'Neill makes a gesture to
     say "what's happening?"

  JACOB
     Some of you know Aldwin. He'll be conducting the
     orientation for your new officers.

  ALDWIN
     We'll begin with a tour of the facilities. After
     that I have prepared a lecture on the development
     of Tok'ra insurgency techniques since the collapse
     of the second Goa'uld dynasty.

  ANNOTATION
     The two teams look very nonplussed!.

  O'NEILL
     I take it all back Lieutenant. This could be hot.

  JACOB
     Come.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob puts his arm out to escort Carter.


LOCATION--TOK'RA MEETING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, Daniel, Teal'c and Jacob are sat
     around a table.

  DANIEL
     So how're you going to get me in?

  JACOB
     Yu will be among the System Lords attending the
     meeting.

  CARTER
     I thought you said he'd be going in as a slave?

  JACOB
     The System Lord Yu.

  CARTER
     Little joke there.

  ANNOTATION
     She makes a 'small' gesture with her hands, and
     looks to the team for acknowledgement.

  O'NEILL
     Funny.

  DANIEL
     Yu knows my face, he'll recognise me.

  ANNOTATION
     Ren Au walks in.

  REN AU
     He will not.

  JACOB
     Ren Au and her team have been working on a
     modified version of the chemical SG-1 obtained
     from the Reol.

  REN AU
     If you can get close enough to inject him, you
     will be able to convince him that you are, in
     fact, his most trusted Lo'taur.

  O'NEILL
     His what?

  TEAL'C
     Lo'taur is the highest rank amongst the human
     slaves of the System Lords.

  JACOB
     They're like personal attendants. It's considered
     to be a position of great honour. I spent the last
     couple of months establishing myself as a minor
     Goa'uld in Yu's service. I'll be able to get
     Daniel on board his mothership and deal with the
     loose ends.

  CARTER
     What if Nirrti shows up?

  JACOB
     Not much chance of that, she's still a renegade.
     And persona non grata among the System Lords. None
     of the other remaining System Lords have seen
     Danny's face.

  DANIEL
     Assuming I make it on to the space station, what
     happens next?

  REN AU
     You will wait until all the System Lords have
     arrived and then you will use this. (retrieves a
     vial from a pocket and gives it to Daniel) These
     two liquids mixed together form the most virulent
     poison. Press the button to open the valve between
     the two containers. The liquid will immediately be
     vaporised, within seconds the pressure will break
     the seal on the container and the gas will be
     released.

  DANIEL
     Am I supposed to hold my breath?

  REN AU
     The poison is only deadly to symbiotes.

  CARTER
     Isn't that a little dangerous?

  JACOB
     More than you know. There's enough material in
     that vial to kill every Tok'ra on this base twice
     over.

  REN AU
     That is why this formula is our most closely
     guarded secret.

  DANIEL
     And it doesn't kill the host?

  REN AU
     Not the chemical itself, but as you know, the
     dying symbiote releases its own toxin which is
     just as deadly.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel smiles sarcastically.

  JACOB
     Daniel, the human host of a System Lord has been
     through the sarcophagus countless times. We know
     the toll that takes, they're hundreds, sometimes
     thousands of years old. Never mind the
     psychological damage they suffered, physically,
     without the Goa'uld sustaining them, they'd die
     anyway.

  DANIEL
     So we're doing them a favour?

  JACOB
     In many ways, yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods reluctantly.

  O'NEILL
     How many targets?

  JACOB
     There'll be seven System Lords at the meeting.
     That's all the major players. If we pull this off,
     the Goa'uld may never recover.

  O'NEILL
     What can we do?

  JACOB
     Wait here. I'll communicate when the mission has
     been accomplished.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill runs after Jacob.

  O'NEILL
     Jacob. Jacob, wait up!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shoves a Tok'ra out of his way.

  O'NEILL
     Why do I get the feeling there's something you're
     not telling us?

  JACOB
     Oh, Jack.

  ANNOTATION
     They start walking down a tunnel.

  O'NEILL
     Oh come on. You're the one who's always saying
     that every time we knock off one of these System
     Lords a worse one shows up. Why should this be any
     different?

  JACOB
     It is true that others would eventually rise up
     but by taking them all out at once. We'll create a
     power vacuum that will lead to a massive galaxy
     wide war as the remaining Goa'uld jockey for
     position. That'll last long enough for us to make
     a final decisive move.

  O'NEILL
     Which is?

  ANNOTATION
     They stop.

  JACOB
     A wide scale attack on the entire Goa'uld
     population using the symbiote poison. (points his
     finger at O'Neill) We're going to wipe them out,
     Jack. All of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob walks off.


LOCATION--GOA'ULD MOTHERSHIP


LOCATION--ZIPACNA'S MOTHERSHIP

  OSIRIS
     Why have I been enlisted for this task?

  ZIPACNA
     Politics have always been one of your greater
     skills.

  OSIRIS
     And am I to go alone?

  ZIPACNA
     I have my own mission upon which I must embark.
     Apparently the Tok'ra have developed a formidable
     new weapon.

  OSIRIS
     How do you know?

  ZIPACNA
     I captured a Tok'ra spy in my midst.

  OSIRIS
     (obviously unimpressed, merely tolerating Zipacna)
     I doubt very much a Tok'ra would reveal this
     information. No matter how you tortured him.

  ZIPACNA
     You are correct. But Anubis has methods that would
     impress you.

  OSIRIS
     What are you going to do?

  ZIPACNA
     I am going to take this weapon from the Tok'ra...
     (moves toward Osiris and whispers into her ear)
     ...and destroy them.

  ANNOTATION
     Zipacna walks off.


LOCATION--JACOB'S TEL'TAK

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is wearing a costume of Yu's lo'taur. He
     putting contact lenses in. Jacob enters, dressing
     as a Goa'uld in Yu's service.

  DANIEL
     So why do the System Lords need human attendants?

  JACOB
     Well the Jaffa serve as strictly military
     function. Besides if the host of a System Lord is
     ever injured beyond a symbiotes capacity to heal,
     it can be pretty useful to have a human close at
     hand.

  DANIEL
     Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.

  JACOB
     Are you clear on all the backgrounds of the System
     Lords?

  DANIEL
     (sighs, frowning) Oh yeah, I'm fine.

  JACOB
     Good, we'll be at Yu's home world in a little over
     an hour.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob starts to walk away then turns back.

  JACOB
     Are you all right Daniel?

  DANIEL
     (still frowning) Oh yeah, I'm fine.

  JACOB
     Listen, if you're not 100% committed to this
     mission, I need to know.

  DANIEL
     I just think some of your details are a little.
     sketchy.

  JACOB
     Like what?

  DANIEL
     Well you're going to use poison to wipe out the
     Goa'uld, right?

  JACOB
     Eventually.

  DANIEL
     What about the Jaffa?

  JACOB
     Well that's still a bit of a wrinkle. Unless we
     can find a way to reverse their biological
     dependency on immature symbiotes, they'll all die
     as well.

  DANIEL
     A bit of a wrinkle.

  JACOB
     Danny, the Goa'uld have been spreading like a
     plague across the galaxy for thousands of years.
     Now for the first time they're showing zero
     population growth. We're not sure why. But we
     intend to take advantage of the situation. We may
     never get a chance like this again. Are we good to
     go?

  DANIEL
     (nods) Yeah.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     Aldwin is leading SG-17 around the tunnels.

  ALDWIN
     As you know, when the Tok'ra arrive on a new
     planet it is customary to move underground as
     quickly as possible.

  ELLIOT
     And you actually grow these tunnels from crystals?

  ALDWIN
     That is correct. Individual crystals are
     programmed with the specific layout of a given
     passageway allowing us to structure the tunnel
     system as we see fit.

  MANSFIELD
     What about ventilation shafts?

  ALDWIN
     There are none. If we tunnel through suitable rock
     such as calcium carbonate as we have done here,
     oxygen is produced as a by-product. This gives us
     enough time to enter the tunnels and set up our
     life support systems.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks up to the group.

  MANSFIELD
     Colonel.

  ELLIOT
     Sir!

  O'NEILL
     Gentlemen. How goes the orientation?

  ELLIOT
     It's very interesting, Sir, just as you predicted.

  ALDWIN
     (to O'Neill) Are you interested in Tok'ra
     engineering?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, interested doesn't quite describe how I truly
     feel.

  ALDWIN
     You're welcome to join us.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-17 start to smirk.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you Aldwin, (tapping him on the shoulder)
     but I have to go help Teal'c...wait...for Daniel.
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks off.


LOCATION--JACOB'S TEL'TAK

  JACOB
     I can get you into Yu's quarters. Your job is to
     get close enough to use this.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob hands Daniel a box. He opens it and takes
     out a ring.

  JACOB
     All you have to do is prick him. The effect will
     be immediate. He will believe you to be his loyal
     slave, Jarren.

  DANIEL
     Jarren?

  JACOB
     Just don't jab yourself with it.

  DANIEL
     Why?

  JACOB
     Actually I don't know exactly. That in itself
     should scare you.


LOCATION--TOK'RA LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Ren Au walk in they stop at a small
     podium.

  REN AU
     As you know Major, we kept the body in stasis for
     several months as we tried to find a way to repair
     the damage.

  ANNOTATION
     A chamber rises out of the centre of the podium. A
     Goa'uld symbiote is inside, with many wires
     attached to it.

  REN AU
     But in the end, we were unsuccessful. All that is
     left of Martouf, now lives on in Lantash.

  CARTER
     What's its condition.

  REN AU
     The symbiote is still recuperating but...the
     search is already on to find a new host.

  CARTER
     I wanna see the research.

  REN AU
     I'm sorry Major but all information pertaining to
     zatarc technology...

  CARTER
     (interrupts) ...can only be released on the
     authority of the council. I know. They've been
     stonewalling me for months. She sounds annoyed.

  REN AU
     I assure you, Martouf was in no pain.

  CARTER
     That's not the problem.

  REN AU
     What then?

  CARTER
     If the symbiote was still alive when Martouf was
     taken out of stasis, wasn't there a chance it
     could have healed his injuries?

  REN AU
     The possibility was remote.

  CARTER
     (becoming more annoyed) How remote?

  REN AU
     The host was too weak. In all likelihood the
     symbiote would have died trying to repair the
     damage.

  CARTER
     You don't know that for sure.

  REN AU
     Well we had to make a choice.

  CARTER
     And naturally you chose the symbiote.

  REN AU
     Your bias towards the host is only natural. Surely
     it is better for one to live than for both to die?

  CARTER
     Isn't this really about your zatarc research?

  REN AU
     (looking down at the podium, avoiding her gaze) I
     don't understand.

  CARTER
     If Martouf had lived you wouldn't have had the
     chance to examine his brain tissue. You wouldn't
     have learned anything.

  REN AU
     Would you really have preferred his sacrifice to
     have been for nothing?

  CARTER
     I would have preferred another way.

  REN AU
     You knew Martouf well?

  CARTER
     Yes.

  REN AU
     Knowing him as you did, what choice do you think
     he would have made?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter doesn't say anything.

  REN AU
     Martouf is not entirely gone, Major. His thoughts
     and his memories live on in Lantash.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter's eyes turn to the symbiote within the
     chamber.


LOCATION--YU'S PALACE


LOCATION--YU'S PALACE

  ANNOTATION
     Jarren is making a pot of tea when Jacob/Selmak
     walk in.

  SELMAK
     Jarren.

  JARREN
     My Lord does not wish to be disturbed at this
     time.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel zats him.

  DANIEL
     You know, I don't look a thing like this guy.

  JACOB
     Well luckily for this to work you don't have to.
     You'll be fine. Just remember to pour from the
     right.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob drags Jarren off and Daniel takes the tea
     tray in. Yu is not there so Daniel puts the tray
     down. Yu walks in behind him.

  YU
     Kel shak Jarren.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel adjusts the ring. Yu walks up behind him
     and puts his hand on his shoulder.

  YU
     Ona kree! Onak!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns and puts his hand on Yu's.

  DANIEL
     Nistra Jarren. (lowers his hand and bows down) I
     am your loyal servant Jarren.

  YU
     Rise. I will have my tea.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     Alarms are going off. J Tok'ra are running through
     the corridors. There is much activity. O'Neill and
     Teal'c meet Carter and Ren Au.

  O'NEILL
     What's going on?

  REN AU
     We've received a transmission. Our sensors on the
     surface have detected a fleet of motherships bound
     for Ravanna. We must leave immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     They meet Aldwin.

  ALDWIN SYMBIOTE
     An incoming wormhole is blocking our escape
     through the Stargate.

  CARTER
     The Goa'uld can only sustain a wormhole for 38
     minutes.

  REN AU
     The ships will be here before then.

  ALDWIN SYMBIOTE
     There is no other escape.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Yu's Telchak approaches a space station.


LOCATION--YU'S TEL'TAK

  ANNOTATION
     Yu and Daniel are sat in the front seats of the
     Telchak.

  VOICE
     Identify yourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     Yu looks at Daniel, who answers.

  DANIEL
     I represent the Jade Emperor, the exalted Lord Yu
     Wang Shang Ti.

  MAN
     Two life signs scanned. No weapons detected.
     Lowering shields.

  YU
     Our fellow System Lords are not to be trusted.
     (looks at Daniel) Neither are their slaves.

  DANIEL
     (nods slowly) Understood, my Lord.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship docks.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     There is hive of activity. Alarms are still
     sounding. Many Tok'ra are seen running to and fro.
     SG-1 and SG-17 run onto screen, with Ren Au.

  CARTER
     Do you have any ships available for evacuation?

  REN AU
     A few un-armed cargo ships but they're with
     operatives on other missions.

  ANNOTATION
     They bump into Aldwin, heading in the opposite
     direction.

  ALDWIN
     We have begun making new tunnels.

  O'NEILL
     What good is that going to do?

  ALDWIN SYMBIOTE
     Spread out the risk of getting hit by an air
     attack. You could lend us a hand moving life
     support equipment and supplies to the new tunnels.

  O'NEILL
     (pauses, then nods) Major. Lend `em a hand.

  MANSFIELD
     Yes sir.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-17 leave with Aldwin, SG-1 leave with Ren Au.


LOCATION--TOK'RA MEETING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Ren Au goes to a console.

  CARTER
     What are you doing?

  REN AU
     I'm cutting power to the base. The energy
     signature would give away our position. Now
     they'll have to resort to random bombardment.

  O'NEILL
     Well that's encouraging.

  REN AU
     Colonel, the Tok'ra have never had the military
     resources of the Goa'uld. We use disguise and
     subterfuge to achieve our goals, our bases are
     designed to be hidden. We are just not equipped to
     repulse such a large enemy force.

  CARTER
     Well they're not just going to go away.

  REN AU
     I can assure you Major, if this base is
     compromised, we will fight until the last of us
     has fallen.

  O'NEILL
     With what? Zats?

  REN AU
     What else is there?

  O'NEILL
     Well, you got that poison. And if it's half as
     good as you say it is, it could wipe out any
     potential ground assault.

  REN AU
     And risk killing every Tok'ra on this base as
     well?

  O'NEILL
     Hey, we're all going to die if we sit around and
     wait for the attack.

  REN AU HOST
     Believe me, if it came down to it, we would
     sacrifice ourselves and use the poison on our
     enemy if we had some. Unfortunately the only
     quantity in existence is in Selmak's possession.
     It would take weeks to synthesise more.

  ANNOTATION
     The symbiote takes over again and she leaves
     followed by SG-1.

  EXT GOA'ULD SPACE STATION



LOCATION--GOA'ULD MEETING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Yu and Daniel walk in.

  SLAVE
     Lord Yu Wang Shang Ti.

  ANNOTATION
     Yu looks round the room. It is full of the System
     Lords and their slaves.

  YU
     Note them, Jarren. Our future allies.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Yu circle the room and Daniel points
     out the Goa'uld as they move round.

  DANIEL
     (in reference to two female Goa'uld talking in the
     middle) Bastet. Kali the Destroyer. They made a
     treaty with Sobek then moved against him during
     the celebratory feast. Sobek let his guard down.
     Rumour has it, his head still decorates Bastet's
     palace in Mubastas.

  YU
     You have a good memory. They are still worthy of
     my allegiance. (he looks at Ba'al) Do not accept
     gifts from Ba'al.

  DANIEL
     They have a habit of exploding especially when he
     feels he has been slighted. He wiped out the
     inhabitants of two star systems, sixty million
     lives, rather than lose them to Sokar in a
     territorial dispute.

  YU
     Poor loser. (they watch a woman with red hair) Do
     not consort with Morrigan's servant.

  DANIEL
     He will attempt to draw strategic information in
     seemingly idle conversation. I know your last
     servant unwittingly gave away the location of one
     of your secret bases in Velong, to his credit, he
     was killed in the surprise attack. It is what has
     given me the honour to serve you, my Lord.

  YU
     (they see a tall man dressed in African costume)
     Olokun is still seething over a recent loss to my
     forces. He may try to kill you out of spite. Do
     not make me look foolish by allowing yourself to
     be murdered.

  DANIEL
     Yes, my Lord.

  ANNOTATION
     Yu approaches Ba'al.

  BA'AL
     Yu.

  ANNOTATION
     They bow their heads to one another.

  BA'AL
     I am pleased you were able to join us given recent
     events. I understand your fleet suffered some
     heavy losses.

  YU
     I am not the only one. Did I not hear that your
     flagship was destroyed?

  BA'AL
     I lost two thousand Jaffa.

  YU
     Such is war.

  BA'AL
     No. This is different. This enemy attacks like a
     coward. Bastet and Kali have suffered similar
     setbacks. They are becoming more frequent while
     the identity of our antagonist continues to elude
     us.

  YU
     I am certain you have your suspicions.

  BA'AL
     We are all suffering at the hands of this unknown
     adversary. By shrouding himself he sows discord
     amongst us.


LOCATION--RAVANNA

  ANNOTATION
     Many Al-kesh start to bombard the surface of
     Ravanna.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Ren Au are moving through the tunnels
     when part of it collapses nearby onto some Tok'ra.

  O'NEILL
     (into radio) Mansfield, this is O'Neill. Report.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     Elliot and Aldwin are trying to unbury a Tok'ra.

  MANSFIELD
     A section of the structure collapsed. We have some
     injured Tok'ra here.

  ELLIOT
     Sir, we've got another one.

  O'NEILL
     Get `em out of there.

  MANSFIELD
     Roger that. Let's go, we got to move. Elliot,
     let's go.

  ELLIOT
     He's still alive, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     More tunnel collapses and hits Mansfield and some
     other Tok'ra.

  O'NEILL
     Major, what's your situation? Mansfield, report!


LOCATION--ZIPACNA'S MOTHERSHIP

  JAFFA
     The Al-kesh continues to bomb the area around the
     Gate. No Tok'ra have surfaced in an attempt to
     escape.

  ZIPACNA
     Escape? There is no escape. They hide in their
     tunnels like rats. Continue the bombardment.
     Prepare your groundtroops for infiltration.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Ren Au come across Elliot and Aldwin
     carrying Mansfield.

  O'NEILL
     Elliot?

  ELLIOT
     Direct hit, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Where's the rest of your team?

  ELLIOT
     They're dead.

  CARTER
     Sir, we need to get him to the infirmary. She
     takes Mansfield's arm from Aldwin

  ALDWIN
     The Infirmary's been destroyed.

  REN AU
     We'll take them to the lab. Follow me!

  ANNOTATION
     They reach the lab and more ceiling falls in an
     explosion.

  REN AU
     I'm transferring the formula for the poison to
     this crystal and erasing the memory of the
     computer. We will die before we give up our
     secrets.

  O'NEILL
     You know, we really should come up with a new
     strategy. One that does not include us dying.

  TEAL'C
     We must determine what is happening on the
     surface, O'Neill.

  ALDWIN SYMBIOTE
     With the power down, we are cut off from the
     surface sensors. You'll have to use the secondary
     ring room.

  REN AU
     Show them.

  ANNOTATION
     Aldwin nods.


LOCATION--SPACE STATION

  ANNOTATION
     A Goa'uld walks past with a slave and Daniel moves
     into an alcove and bows his head. He gets out a
     communication device.

  DANIEL
     Jacob? Jacob, are you there, it's Daniel.

  JACOB
     (on his telchak) Daniel? How's it going?

  DANIEL
     Oh swell, it's kinda like Goa'uld Mardi Gras here.

  JACOB
     A ship just docked so by my account you got all
     seven. It's time to release the poison.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, we may wanna hold off a while. Apparently
     they're expecting someone else.

  JACOB
     Who?

  DANIEL
     I don't know. It seems they've got some mysterious
     new adversary that's been causing some pretty
     serious headaches.

  JACOB
     That's strange. It's not like the Goa'uld to play
     it so coy.

  DANIEL
     Well, I'll see what I can find out. I'll contact
     you later.

  ANNOTATION
     He checks the coast is clear, then walks off.


LOCATION--TOK'RA LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is injecting something into Mansfield.

  CARTER
     We have to get him out of here. This man needs
     medical attention.

  REN AU
     We've done all we can right now.

  CARTER
     What about the symbiote?

  REN AU
     It's out of the question.

  CARTER
     It could save Major Mansfield's life.

  REN AU
     The symbiote's life is being sustained by the
     chamber. It's in no condition to help your friend.

  CARTER
     (returning to Mansfield) We can't just let him
     die.

  REN AU
     If we implant the symbiote, we kill them both.

  ANNOTATION
     The ceiling suddenly collapses hitting Ren Au and
     Elliot. A piece of rock hits the chamber with
     Lantash in and smashes it. Carter tries to cover
     Mansfield.


LOCATION--RAVANNA

  ANNOTATION
     The Al-kesh continue to bombard the planet.
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Aldwin approach a bank. They
     lie down and peek over the top. Hundreds of Jaffa
     are on the ground.

  O'NEILL
     They appear to be amassing a few troops.

  TEAL'C
     Once the aerial bombardment exposes the tunnels,
     they will infiltrate and search them.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill reaches for his radio.

  O'NEILL
     Carter, come in. (no response) Carter, respond.
     (again, there is no response) Let's get back.


LOCATION--GOA'ULD MEETING CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     The System Lords are sat on high chairs, in a
     circle.

  YU
     This has gone on long enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Yu is standing in the middle of the circle. He
     returns to his chair.

  YU
     We must determine who is responsible for these
     attacks.

  BA'AL
     The coward refuses to show himself. He only
     strikes with his ships never with ground troops.

  YU
     (getting ever louder) None of you have seen the
     faces of the enemy Jaffa?

  ANNOTATION
     They look at each other suspiciously.

  BASTET
     I have. When my outpost at Zeldor came under
     assault, my First Prime managed to disable and
     board one of the enemy ships.

  YU
     Did you take any prisoners?

  BASTET
     They fought to the death. Most had been in service
     of Cronus and Sokar. But one bore the mark of
     Olokun.

  ANNOTATION
     Bastet raises her eyebrows at Olokun.

  YU
     How do you explain this?

  OLOKUN
     One of my motherships was surrounded by the enemy.
     Instead of dying with honour, the cowards
     surrendered and were taken. They may well have
     switched their allegiance.

  BA'AL
     And you expect us to believe this?

  OLOKUN
     I too have suffered at the hands of this unseen
     foe. How dare you accuse me!

  SLAVE
     My Lords. The final guest has arrived.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gets out the poison. The final guest walks
     in.

  OSIRIS
     I hope I'm not missing all the fun.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel moves away out of her sight. He is taken
     aback.

  BA'AL
     Welcome Osiris.

  OSIRIS
     I thank you for honouring my request.

  OLOKUN
     Normally a petition for a seat at this conference
     would not have been considered. Of course the
     current situation is far from normal.

  YU
     Jarren?

  ANNOTATION
     Yu puts his hand out for a drink. Daniel quickly
     puts the poison away and pours Yu a drink. Osiris
     watches. Daniel hands him a cup and looks up.
     Osiris spots him and just smiles.

  OSIRIS
     I think you'll find I have much to offer. Shall we
     proceed?


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNELS

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa have infiltrated and start firing on
     Tok'ra. There is a fire fight. Several Tok'ra die
     from staff blasts as they defend the entrance to
     the tunnels.


LOCATION--RAVANNA

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm starts to go off on Aldwin's belt as
     O'Neill and Teal'c run back with him.

  O'NEILL
     What's that?

  ALDWIN SYMBIOTE
     A warning. The Jaffa have breached the tunnels.

  ANNOTATION
     A glider starts to fire on them. They lurch
     forward but continue running. As they reach the
     tress another glider fires. This time they are
     thrown into the air. Aldwin lands on his neck and
     it is obviously broken. Teal'c checks on Aldwin
     and his eyes glow one last time showing the
     symbiote has died.

  TEAL'C
     He is dead.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns to see the gliders coming round to
     attack again. They leave to re enter the tunnels.


LOCATION--TOK'RA LAB

  ANNOTATION
     There is much debris. Carter wakes up and looks
     around. She checks Mansfield's pulse and finds he
     is dead. She pulls his dog tags off and puts them
     in her pocket. She goes over to Ren Au and sees
     she is dead too. Carter takes the crystal
     containing the information on the poison from Ren
     Au's pocket and puts it in her own. She then moves
     towards Elliot.

  CARTER
     Lieutenant?

  ANNOTATION
     His eyes open and glow.

  CARTER
     Oh my God.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks over to the chamber where Lantash was
     and sees it is empty.

  CARTER
     Lantash?

  LANTASH
     I had no choice.

  CARTER
     Elliot?

  LANTASH
     I'm afraid his injuries are severe. There is
     serious internal damage. It's going to take all my
     strength just to keep him alive. He will have to
     speak for both of us.

  ANNOTATION
     His eyes close and Carter puts her hand on his
     face.

  ELLIOT
     Major?

  CARTER
     Elliot. It's going to be okay.

  ELLIOT
     If you say so.

  CARTER
     Believe me, I know. The symbiote's trying to heal
     you.

  ELLIOT
     Okay.

  CARTER
     Okay.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c are making their way back to
     the lab when they bump into Carter, who is helping
     Elliot walk.

  O'NEILL
     Carter!

  CARTER
     The ceiling in the lab collapsed, Sir. Ren Au and
     Major Mansfield are dead.

  TEAL'C
     As is Aldwin.

  CARTER
     Elliot's in rough shape, there's a Tok'ra symbiote
     inside him.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  ELLIOT
     Feels very weird sir.

  CARTER
     Lantash. He's keeping him alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Staff blasts are heard.

  O'NEILL
     Let's take our chances on the surface.


LOCATION--GOA'ULD SPACE STATION

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks down a corridor and into a room,
     presumably part of Yu's quarters. He gets out a
     communication device.

  DANIEL
     Jacob?

  JACOB
     What's the delay? They should all be there by now.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, we got a full house. But there's a
     complication. Sarah's here.

  JACOB
     Sarah? You mean Osiris? Did she recognise you?

  DANIEL
     I don't know, I think so but she didn't tip her
     hand and I don't know why.

  ANNOTATION
     The door behind him opens and Osiris is behind
     him.

  OSIRIS
     Daniel Jackson. You're a rather long way from home
     aren't you?

  ANNOTATION
     The door closes.


LOCATION--TOK'RA TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Elliot are trying to find a way out when
     more of the ceiling collapses.

  TEAL'C
     The tunnel is blocked.

  CARTER
     Does Lantash know if there's another way to the
     secondary ring room?

  ELLIOT
     There isn't.

  TEAL'C
     Then indeed we are trapped.
