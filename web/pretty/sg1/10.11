<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>BA'AL: Ah yes, I may have exaggerated about that slightly. Anyway, you didn't think that just by calling out its name, you'd suddenly be able to control it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>DANIEL: I don't know. Name magic is common in most mythologies. To know something's secret name is to steal its power.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Which means it's not a hologram. If it was a hologram, the bullets would have gone straight through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>BA'AL: So it's not that your weapons aren't ineffective, it's that they're ineffective in a different way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>MITCHELL: What I am saying is that if bullets bounce, maybe we should try something that packs a little more punch.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He pulls out a block of C-4 explosive from his pack, then another. Carter pulls a block from her pack and tosses it to Mitchell. Daniel does the same. Mitchell pulls some black tape from his tac vest and begins taping the C-4 blocks together.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>MITCHELL: All right, here is what we're gonna do. We're going to lure Daryl down to the ground.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>MITCHELL: We're gonna take this thing, and we're gonna toss it underneath and detonate it near the exposed underbelly. That's where dragons are most vulnerable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel sort of nods, but Carter looks skeptical. Mitchell finishes constructing the bomb and tosses the detonator to Carter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell holds the bomb in his right hand. As he speaks, Teal'c rushes forward and grabs Mitchell's right forearm. Mitchell looks up at Teal'c, comprehending. He tries to pull his arm away, but Teal'c restrains him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>MITCHELL: That's all right Teal'c; I got this one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Appearing very determined, Teal'c runs toward the center of the meadow. Carter and Mitchell take up positions behind a boulder so they can cover him. Teal'c fires his weapon into the air, drawing the dragon. The dragon swoops toward him, and he dives onto the ground. The dragon lands on the ground in front of Teal'c and faces him while still flapping its wings. Teal'c stands up and throws the bomb at the dragon, and it catches it in its mouth and swallows it. Carter activates the remote detonator. After a moment the bomb goes off inside the dragon's throat. The flames come out of the neck and mouth of the dragon, then dissipate. The dragon screams in anger but does not appear injured. Teal'c looks at it in disbelief.</td></tr>
