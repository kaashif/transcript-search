A near miss knocks O'Neill down, Teal'c goes to help him; as they look up an Alkesh rises from behind woodland. They run for the gate and O'Neill hurls himself through. Teal'c pauses, turns, and recognizes Tanith at the controls of the Alkesh. He holds off firing until the ship moves closer, then fires directly into the cockpit. With a look of satisfaction he turns and runs into the wormhole. The ship dives towards the gate, crashes and explodes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L479"><td><a href="#L479">479</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Siler turns the switch that activates the gate. The gate spins but with much electrical sparking. It stops and the event horizon, instead of kawooshing, flares brightly. Teal'c stumbles out onto the ramp. The sparking races around the gate, runs down the ramp to the DHD. The DHD explodes, knocking Siler off his feet.</td></tr>
