Thor's Hammer
TEASER

LOCATION--ENTRANCE TO CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN

  HAMMOND
     (voiceover) Doctor Jackson, I understand you've
     come up with some new theory about the Stargate.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and SG-1 are sitting at the briefing table
     with two SFs standing guard, each on opposite
     sides of the room.

  DANIEL
     Ah, yes, sir. Okay. Uhh...if you study myths
     worldwide, it looks as if there were two different
     kinds of star gods. Um. The tyrants who treated
     their subjects like cattle, demanded absolute
     obedience, utilized their technology to punish and
     control.

  CARTER
     As in the Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     (nods) And the culture bearers who used knowledge
     and technology to benefit humans.

  HAMMOND
     So you're saying that the Goa'ulds weren't the
     only aliens to visit Earth in the past. Well, how
     does that affect us today?

  DANIEL
     We don't think the Goa'uld built the Stargate
     system. Being parasitic by nature, they just used
     it to become a dominant race in the galaxy. But
     some of the good gods, who liked humans, might
     have used it too, and they could still be out
     there.

  HAMMOND
     Any indication of who they are?

  DANIEL
     Yes, sir. The Vikings. (taps button on laptop to
     bring up pictures of Norse mythology) Now in Norse
     mythology the gods were powerful warriors. Legend
     tells us that the god Thor was a friend to humans
     and protected them from the Etins, being of great
     power and knowledge who were enemies of mankind.
     He used a weapon called Thor's Hammer. Now when
     Thor hurled the hammer, uh, it supposedly produced
     thunder and--and lightning. Now that could
     indicate some sort of, uh, advanced type of energy
     weapon.

  O'NEILL
     Sir, I think what Daniel's trying to say is, if
     there is another bunch of aliens out there who are
     hostile to the Goa'uld and have equal or superior
     firepower, we outta look them up.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods.

  CARTER
     They could become allies.

  TEAL'C
     I have seen the Hammer sign before. It is the
     symbol of a world called Cimmeria. All Jaffa are
     taught the sequence of Stargate symbols to that
     world.

  HAMMOND
     Why is that, Teal'c?

  TEAL'C
     To ensure that no Goa'uld goes there. It is
     forbidden. Something transpired on Cimmeria that
     no Goa'uld will speak of.

  O'NEILL
     Well, I like the sound of that.

  HAMMOND
     So do I, Colonel. All right, you have a go.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A MALP is going up the ramp. Hammond enters
     carrying a box.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel, we'd like you to take this along with
     you. It's a gift.

  ANNOTATION
     The box is dark brown and about 9 in. x 9 in. x 3
     in. in size. On the background of the lid is the
     Stargate symbol for Earth. In the foreground, from
     left to right, is a man, a boy, a girl and a
     woman.

  O'NEILL
     Gee sir, I don't know what to say...

  HAMMOND
     For the alien friendlies, in the event you succeed
     in your mission and make contact.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel comes over from beside the ramp where he
     was finishing gearing up.

  DANIEL
     Oh, you had it made. It's great.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes box from O'Neill and looks at it,
     smiling.

  DANIEL
     Oh, we asked the Sagan Institute to imagine a sort
     of...greeting from Earth, if they could somehow
     hypothetically get it to a distant world. Uh, it's
     all about who we are. It explains various Earth
     cultures, religions, the histories.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over speakers) Chevron one encoding.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel goes up the ramp to place the box on the
     MALP. Hammond exits the Gate room.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over speakers) Chevron two encoded.

  O'NEILL
     Time to go to work.


LOCATION--CIMMERIA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Camera looks from base to top of the back of
     Thor's Hammer, then over the top to see the
     Stargate and DHD below. The Hammer has Celtic-like
     designs carved in raised relief on the front and
     back. Several men with a cart are to the right of
     the Stargate. Stargate activates, and everyone
     turns to look. As the wormhole boils out, the men
     shield their faces with their arms and one man
     runs off. SG-1 tumbles out, the men laughing at
     them.

  DANIEL
     This is...different.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you're on.

  ANNOTATION
     Men chant 'Thor! Thor! Thor!' and look at the top
     of Hammer. The Hammer makes a humming noise.

  CARTER
     It sounds like it's building up some kind of
     charge.

  O'NEILL
     All right Daniel, dial home, we're going back.
     Now.

  DANIEL
     Why?

  O'NEILL
     Just do it. That's an order.

  ANNOTATION
     Men are still chanting 'Thor!' A blue beam comes
     from the top of the Hammer as Daniel begins
     dialing--the beam scans him then moves on to
     Carter, O'Neill, then Teal'c, focusing on his
     abdomen. Teal'c puts a hand on his stomach in
     pain.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c! Get outta there!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c yells in pain as the beam increases in
     intensity. O'Neill runs to push Teal'c out of the
     beam. Just as O'Neill connects with Teal'c, both
     vanish. The beam shuts off and natives run,
     leaving the cart behind. Carter moves to where
     O'Neill and Teal'c vanished from and looks at the
     Hammer again. Carter and Daniel look bewildered.


LOCATION--CIMMERIA, DAY

  DANIEL
     (looking at Hammer) I think that this is Thor's
     Hammer. (steps back two paces) I--I...I think
     they're dead.

  CARTER
     I don't want to hear that. You said Thor liked
     humans, that he used his weapon to protect them.
     We go back, we bring another SG team through, and
     we start a search.

  ANNOTATION
     Horse whinnies.

  DANIEL
     Wait.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman (Gairwyn) on horseback followed by a group
     of men, all running, come from the distance behind
     and to the left of the Stargate. The woman stops
     in front of Carter and Daniel.

  GAIRWYN
     You're a little short for gods.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel are startled.

  GAIRWYN
     (dismounts) But you came through the portal
     unharmed, so you must be from Thrudvang, Thor's
     home in the stars. Hail and welcome.

  CARTER
     Actually, we're not uh-- (puts hand on chest) I'm
     Captain Samantha Carter. (gestures at Daniel) This
     is Daniel Jackson.

  GAIRWYN
     My name is Gairwyn. I'm mistress here, my husband
     is gone a-Viking.

  DANIEL
     (nods) Um, trading, fighting.

  GAIRWYN
     That was in the old days. Nowadays they go to the
     towns to look for work. It's been a hard season
     for farmers. Water from the mountains is scarce,
     but you're welcome at my table.

  DANIEL
     (quietly) Thank you.

  CARTER
     Yeah, thanks, but we have a very serious problem.
     Two of the men who came through the portal with
     us--they're gone.

  GAIRWYN
     Yes. I heard there were two Etins in your company.

  CARTER
     Etins?

  DANIEL
     Goa'ulds? You think that Teal'c and Jack are
     Goa'ulds?

  GAIRWYN
     You tricked them here to be rid of them, yes?

  CARTER
     No! No, they're friends, and if they're alive we
     need to find them.

  GAIRWYN
     (amazed) You're humans, like us.

  CARTER
     Yes. You and I may even have some of the same
     ancestors. We came here from a different world.
     From Earth.

  DANIEL
     Midgard.

  GAIRWYN
     Then we are your brothers and sisters. Midgard is
     the ancient home. Thor brought our people here and
     (looks and gestures at Hammer) made this to keep
     us safe.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel look back at the Hammer.

  DANIEL
     (pointing up at Hammer) D'you, do you know how
     this works? Are they dead?

  GAIRWYN
     That's a magic beyond our ken. It's said that Thor
     will come back one day and teach us when we are
     older.

  CARTER
     Gairwyn, would Thor kill a human being in order to
     kill an Etin?

  GAIRWYN
     (emphatic) Never. Our gods are great and powerful
     warriors, but they are just and true to their
     word.

  DANIEL
     So they may be alive?

  CARTER
     Is there anyone who might know where they are?

  GAIRWYN
     Only one. We call her Kendra. Ten seasons ago she
     walked through the portal and was taken.

  CARTER
     Taken? Where?

  GAIRWYN
     (shrug) That winter some hunters found her
     wandering half frozen in the mountains.

  CARTER
     (to Daniel) Maybe the beam transported them
     somewhere else on the planet.

  DANIEL
     (to Gairwyn) Do you know where we can find
     this--this Kendra?

  GAIRWYN
     She lives by herself. I take her things now and
     then. We can't spare the horses, but I can take
     you there on foot.

  DANIEL
     (looks at Carter then nods to Gairwyn) Absolutely,
     please.

  GAIRWYN
     (points to where she and the men came from) This
     way.

  ANNOTATION
     Gairwyn raises her arm in goodbye to the crowd of
     men behind the Stargate. Carter, Daniel, and
     Gairwyn walk between the Hammer and DHD off
     screen.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     The cave is dimly lit with candles with water
     dripping from the roof. O'Neill and Teal'c are
     lying on the ground next to the wall, unconscious.
     O'Neill starts awake and sits straight up,
     grabbing his weapon. He gets to his knees,
     surveying the cave.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c wakes and gets quickly to his knees, hand
     on his abdomen. He rips open his shirt and the
     symbiote comes halfway out of the pouch and
     screeches.

  O'NEILL
     Uh, is Junior okay?

  TEAL'C
     Yes...But the beam caused the Goa'uld I carry
     great pain.

  O'NEILL
     I'm--sorry to hear that.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a bluish light in the distance. O'Neill
     turns to look at the source.

  O'NEILL
     Whoa.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at O'Neill and O'Neill points behind
     the camera. Both get swiftly to their feet,
     weapons ready. The camera switches to a very tall
     man with long brown hair and beard, black jerkin,
     helmet, cloak, and silver arm guards, who is
     holding a golden hammer. Thor shakes his head
     slightly. Camera looks at O'Neill and Teal'c over
     Thor's shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     Hello.

  THOR
     I am Thor, Supreme Commander of the Asgard Fleet.
     The High Council of the Asgard has designated
     Cimmeria a safe world for developing sentient
     species by unanimous decree, Era 40.73.29. The
     Goa'uld System Lords were so informed.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, we're not Goa'ulds. (points at Teal'c) He
     carries one around in him, but he doesn't have
     much choice in the matter.

  THOR
     You were warned not to come here. Under pain of
     death.

  O'NEILL
     Look, I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill from Earth. I
     happen to know you spent some time there in our
     past.

  THOR
     For crimes against the living host and all those
     you have murdered and enslaved, the sentence is
     death.

  O'NEILL
     (taking several slow steps forward) Look,
     um...We...came here to...see you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill runs his gun through Thor, disrupting the
     image.

  THOR
     This is your prison. Your technology will not
     function.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill runs his hand back and forth through the
     image, disrupting it again.

  THOR
     There are no luxuries, no worshippers, no slaves
     to do your bidding...

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, I think we just got the answering machine.

  THOR
     ...only basic sustenance. And time.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, well great, thanks--thanks for the chat.

  TEAL'C
     We should hear the remainder of the message.

  THOR
     When you tire of this existence, go to the Hall of
     Mjollnir and face the Hammer. (Thor holds out
     Hammer in right hand) There is no escape. Only the
     host can leave this place. Alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Recording shuts off, image disappears.

  O'NEILL
     Goa'uld trap?

  TEAL'C
     So it would seem. If I attempt to leave this
     place, the Goa'uld I carry will be destroyed.

  O'NEILL
     By a hammer?

  TEAL'C
     You must leave without me. If I stay, I will
     remain safe.

  O'NEILL
     Just relax, Teal'c. I'm not goin' anywhere. Lets
     just find this...Hall of Mohair or whatever it's
     called.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c go to explore the cave.


LOCATION--CIMMERIA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Gairwyn, Carter and Daniel are walking through a
     very rocky area, at the bottom of a steep slope.
     They come upon a small cottage and lean-to style
     shed at the base of a grey cliff. There is a small
     fire between the cottage and shed. Kendra and a
     blond boy are sitting just outside the shed.
     Kendra pulls out a small round piece of Goa'uld
     technology that she places on her hand.

  DANIEL
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel reaches for his sidearm, and Carter brings
     her weapon up.

  GAIRWYN
     Shh.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra looks over to them.

  GAIRWYN
     It's all right.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra activates the device over the boy's
     forehead and brings it down to his right wrist.

  KENDRA
     Rune light flow in might and rain, knit the bones
     and take the pain. (takes strip of cloth wrapped
     around wrist off) Now, the next time you want to
     fight, choose a boy your own size.

  ANNOTATION
     The boy runs off. Gairwyn, Carter and Daniel go
     over to Kendra.

  KENDRA
     Gairwyn, my friend. Hail and welcome.

  GAIRWYN
     This is Carter and Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Hail.

  CARTER
     Hi--Hail.

  GAIRWYN
     They came from the portal, from Midgard, the first
     home. They need your help.

  CARTER
     What did you just do to that boy?

  KENDRA
     He had a broken wrist. I healed it.

  DANIEL
     Then why did he run away?

  KENDRA
     Because of this.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns and shows Carter and Daniel scar on back
     of neck. Carter and Daniel jump back a step and
     ready their weapons.

  KENDRA
     (turning to face Carter and Daniel) It is the mark
     of what I used to be.

  CARTER
     When a Goa'uld takes over a human host, it's
     permanent.

  KENDRA
     Not here. Thor's Hammer drove it from my body and
     restored me to my true self.

  DANIEL
     The "it"? Meaning the parasite that was inside of
     you?

  KENDRA
     Is gone.

  DANIEL
     My God.

  CARTER
     Thor's Hammer, the stone by the Gate?

  KENDRA
     No, the Hammer is deep underground (gestures
     behind them to the cliff) inside the mountain.

  GAIRWYN
     As long as I have known her, Kendra has harmed no
     one.

  DANIEL
     My wife, Sha're, is now as you once were. She has
     been taken by a Goa'uld and--If what you're saying
     is true--

  KENDRA
     It's true.

  DANIEL
     Then help us.

  CARTER
     Help us to find our friends.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c come around a corner into a
     passage lined with a row of braces running from
     the floor, up the side, across the top, and down
     the other side to the floor.

  TEAL'C
     You should not have attempted to rescue me from
     the beam. If you had not done so, you would not be
     here now.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, you'd have done the same for me. Of course
     you're not going to find me walking around with
     one of those Goa'uld larva in my gut, but hey.

  ANNOTATION
     They come out of the passage into a more open area
     with a small pool. They find several bones between
     a few large rocks at the far edge of the pool.
     O'Neill sits on one of the rocks and Teal'c squats
     beside the bones. They each pick one up.

  O'NEILL
     Ouch.

  TEAL'C
     These Goa'uld died with their human hosts. The
     marks on these bones--they are from a cutting
     instrument. But not metal.

  O'NEILL
     What then?

  TEAL'C
     I believe they were made by large powerful teeth.
     These bodies did not die of natural causes. They
     were killed, and then eaten.

  O'NEILL
     It's obvious some wild animal found its way in.
     There's got to be a way out. We find it. We're
     gone.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets up and walks back the way they came,
     patting Teal'c on the shoulder as he passes.
     Teal'c gets up to follow. After they leave, a
     large claw comes out of the pool of water.


LOCATION--KENDRA'S HOME

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra walks between the shed and fire carrying a
     jug over to Gairwyn, Carter and Daniel who are
     sitting at a table with bench seats.

  KENDRA
     (pouring drink) I call it the Labyrinth. (hands
     drinking horn to Daniel) It is the place where the
     Goa'uld was destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     She pours for Carter, who sniffs the drink.

  DANIEL
     How is it done? Did you feel it?

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra pours a drink for Gairwyn.

  KENDRA
     (quietly) Yes.

  DANIEL
     And was it painful?

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra sits.

  KENDRA
     It was nothing like the suffering I--watched
     myself inflict on others....For all those
     years...So many. Your human friend, O'Neill...he
     can walk out unharmed. All you need do is wait.

  CARTER
     Teal'c is our friend too. He is Jaffa, not
     Goa'uld.

  KENDRA
     Jaffa? A friend? They are as guilty as those they
     serve.

  CARTER
     This Jaffa gave up his rank, left his home so he
     could join us and fight the Goa'uld. His dream is
     to see his people free.

  DANIEL
     But if the Goa'uld larva within him is removed, he
     will die. See, once a Jaffa caries a--a larva
     it--it acts as his immune system.

  KENDRA
     I know all I want to know of Jaffa.

  DANIEL
     Right.

  KENDRA
     If the Hammer drives the Goa'uld from him and he
     dies, so be it. It is his penance for serving the
     Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     Teal'c was in the service of Apophis, but...He
     saved our lives and he helped us escape, he is one
     of us now.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra moves to stand in front of the fire. The
     wind suddenly blows hard.

  KENDRA
     (to wind, petulant) Did I ask your counsel? (turns
     to Carter and Daniel) The Valkyrie ride the wind.
     They want me to help you. They say you speak the
     truth. They tell me...that I must take you there.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks to Daniel, who waves his arm to stay
     silent and wait.

  GAIRWYN
     This is right. Go with Thor, my friend.

  ANNOTATION
     Gairwyn leaves.

  KENDRA
     I will take you. But first I must consult the
     runes.


LOCATION--ROOM IN THE MOUNTAIN

  ANNOTATION
     Large room, high ceilinged with lighted lamps
     hanging from chains. On several walls there are
     carvings of runes in a circle around pictures.
     O'Neill and Teal'c enter from the right through a
     doorway, the top cut like a triangle. They look
     around.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, take a shot at that lamp with your staff
     weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c attempts to activate the staff weapon, but
     it won't work.

  TEAL'C
     It will not function.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, that's what he said would happen as long as
     we were in here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shoots at the lamp. The bullet hits the
     chain and the lamp falls to floor in shower of
     sparks, breaking when it hits the ground.


LOCATION--CAVE BY POOL

  ANNOTATION
     See Unas' hand--Unas raises his head and listens
     after he hears the gunshot.

  TEAL'C
     (voiceover) This race may have considered
     projectile weapons too primitive to be concerned
     about.


LOCATION--ROOM IN THE MOUNTAIN

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, here. (hands sidearm to Teal'c)

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c takes the sidearm and puts it away. O'Neill
     sits on a stone bench carved from the wall. Teal'c
     moves to stand next to him, almost leaning against
     the wall.

  TEAL'C
     The message said, "Only the host can leave here
     alive."

  O'NEILL
     Right.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps this could be of some benefit to the boy
     who was your friend.

  O'NEILL
     Skaara. Yeah, I thought'a that.

  TEAL'C
     And the wife of Daniel Jackson. Perhaps if they
     could be brought here, the Goa'uld who took them
     as hosts could be purged.

  O'NEILL
     (sigh) Maybe.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear a splash--O'Neill stands and raises his
     gun.

  TEAL'C
     What is it, O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     Nothin'.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at him, eyebrow raised.

  O'NEILL
     Never mind.


LOCATION--POOL

  ANNOTATION
     Unas is gone.


LOCATION--KENDRA'S HOME, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra places a rock between two others to
     complete a large circle. There are three folded
     blankets spaced on the ground inside the circle.
     Kendra is kneeling in the circle holding a staff
     and looking to the sky.

  KENDRA
     Mighty Thor, God of Thunder and Lightning, wield
     your Hammer and protect me. (stands and turns to
     Carter and Daniel) Now you must sit in the circle
     and wait with me.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up and leaves the circle.

  CARTER
     For what?

  KENDRA
     A sign from Thor himself.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra puts the staff in the shed. Daniel steps
     into the circle.

  CARTER
     Great, another sign.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter puts her gun on the ground and goes into
     the circle.

  DANIEL
     (to Carter, as Carter and Daniel sit on blankets)
     She's probably afraid to go back there, maybe if
     we offer her some moral support.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra comes back and sits on the remaining
     blanket.

  DANIEL
     (to Kendra) How much do you remember of your life
     before?

  KENDRA
     Much. I was a beautiful child.

  CARTER
     Is that bad?

  KENDRA
     On Jebanna, beauty is a curse.

  CARTER
     I don't understand.

  DANIEL
     Because the Goa'uld want perfect hosts?

  KENDRA
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     What happened?

  KENDRA
     Marduk discovered our secret and raided the temple
     where they tried to hide me.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry.

  KENDRA
     Because of my training in the temple, the Goa'uld
     who took possession of my body could not take
     complete control over my mind. A part of
     me--myself--remained.

  DANIEL
     Something of the host survives.

  CARTER
     How did you end up here? Teal'c said the Goa'uld
     made this a forbidden planet ages ago.

  KENDRA
     And so it is. But I knew my beast. She hungered
     for conquest. So I became the voice within. I
     taunted her and whispered of rumors that Cimmeria
     must hold a wealth of riches for one bold enough
     to take it.

  DANIEL
     You actually influenced the Goa'uld that had taken
     you over?

  KENDRA
     Yes. She came to Cimmeria. And I hoped only for a
     quick death...escape. But we were taken into the
     Labyrinth, a dark and terrifying place. Until
     Thor's Hammer set me free. And I have honored his
     ways and his people ever since.

  ANNOTATION
     Thunder. A storm comes over distant hills.

  KENDRA
     It is a sign from Thor. Now we can go.


LOCATION--ROOM IN THE MOUNTAIN

  ANNOTATION
     Back of O'Neill's hand resting against a wall with
     water flowing down it.

  O'NEILL
     Water. (takes hand off wall and shakes water off)
     Give it enough time, it'll bring down walls. Even
     walls just like that. So in a couple hundred
     years, we'll be free.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks toward the center of the room and
     looks over to the entrance. The shadow of the Unas
     is visible. O'Neill smacks Teal'c on the shoulder
     to get his attention. Teal'c turns to the door.

  O'NEILL
     What the hell is that?

  ANNOTATION
     Unas enters.

  UNAS
     Jaffa. I am Unas. The First One.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves toward Unas.

  TEAL'C
     You. Do not. Exist.

  UNAS
     Kill the human...

  O'NEILL
     (takes couple of steps forward) Excuse me?

  UNAS
     ...And we will feast together.

  TEAL'C
     I no longer serve the Goa'uld.

  UNAS
     We shall see.

  ANNOTATION
     Unas approaches O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Hey! Just stay put right there.

  UNAS
     (throws Teal'c aside with one sweep of his arm)
     Weapons are of no use here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill raises his rifle and shoots Unas several
     times. Unas staggers back, then moves forward
     again. O'Neill takes a couple of steps closer and
     opens fire again. Unas hits the wall and slides
     down it until he's sitting on the floor. O'Neill
     goes over to Unas, gun ready. When Unas doesn't
     move, he cautiously lowers the gun. Teal'c gets up
     and comes over, sidearm out.

  TEAL'C
     (kneels next to Unas and feels for pulse) The
     First One is dead.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah well that's fine by me. C'mon.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves. Teal'c kneels next to Unas a few
     seconds longer, then leaves. Unas' eyes glow
     yellow/orange.


LOCATION--CIMMERIA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra, Daniel and Carter leave Kendra's home. As
     time passes, they walk to path at bottom of hill
     of rocks. More time passes as they walk
     single-file up a rocky hill at sunset. Kendra
     points ahead of them.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     A roar can be heard as O'Neill meets up with
     Teal'c. Teal'c turns quickly, gun ready.

  O'NEILL
     What? Teal'c, will you relax? That thing's dead,
     for cryin' out loud.

  TEAL'C
     I believe I heard a sound.

  O'NEILL
     Well there wouldn't be two of those things in
     there. Would there?

  TEAL'C
     If there were, they would surely battle to the
     death.

  O'NEILL
     So what'd you mean when you told that thing it
     didn't exist?

  TEAL'C
     Unas is believed to have been the first host. Born
     of the same primordial waters as the Goa'uld. It
     became a myth; much like your vampyr.

  O'NEILL
     That thing was a Goa'uld?

  TEAL'C
     Yes.

  O'NEILL
     I thought they preferred human hosts.

  TEAL'C
     There are other species far older that have been
     used as hosts. Some with immeasurable power and
     savagery.

  O'NEILL
     Well, I wonder how long it's been trapped down
     here.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps a thousand years. Unas can utilize long
     periods of sleep to survive.

  O'NEILL
     It is dead, right? We don't have to go back there
     and drive a stake through its chest or anything?

  TEAL'C
     The old stories say Unas had great regenerative
     powers. But those are tales told to frighten
     children. It is a myth.

  O'NEILL
     Huh.

  TEAL'C
     It was dead.

  O'NEILL
     That's good.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks down the tunnel.

  TEAL'C
     I believe.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c starts walking, and O'Neill stops and
     turns.

  O'NEILL
     You 'believe'?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill starts walking again when Teal'c is next
     to him.

  TEAL'C
     I am certain.

  O'NEILL
     Positive?

  TEAL'C
     I am.

  O'NEILL
     Just a myth?

  TEAL'C
     A myth.

  O'NEILL
     Good.


LOCATION--CIMMERIA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Looking up rock hill. Kendra comes up opposite
     side and kneels on top. Carter and Daniel come up
     on either side.

  DANIEL
     We're not lost... (kneels) are we?

  KENDRA
     It was long ago. Everything was covered in snow.
     It all looks different now.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks off in disgust.

  DANIEL
     Kendra--It's all right, just...take your time.
     Kendra...when the Goa'uld was destroyed within
     you--what did it feel like, exactly?

  KENDRA
     Your wife?

  DANIEL
     I have to know if there's any hope.

  KENDRA
     It was very painful, like...needles stabbing
     inside the head. The beast will do anything to
     stay in control. It's a battle of wills. Many give
     up.

  DANIEL
     Well Sha're wasn't trained in a temple like you,
     but she had a spirit, she was, she was a fighter.

  KENDRA
     You loved her very much.

  DANIEL
     I still do. I dream about her. It's as if...some
     part of her is reaching out to me, or maybe that's
     just wishful thinking. I...

  KENDRA
     No. You still are connected. If you find her, and
     bring her here, I believe there is hope.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter returns.

  KENDRA
     I'm sure now. (pointing) This is the way.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk off to the left.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c walk out of a tunnel and stop.
     O'Neill looks around with his flashlight. They
     continue up another tunnel. Back in the room with
     the hanging lamps, Unas pulls a bullet out and
     looks at it. Unas roars. O'Neill and Teal's stop
     and look back.

  O'NEILL
     Okay. That's no myth.

  ANNOTATION
     Unas continues roaring.


LOCATION--AQUEDUCT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra, Carter and Daniel are walking on raised
     walkways between the channels of the aqueduct.

  KENDRA
     Gairwyn told me Thor built this centuries ago. It
     brings the water from the mountains (points back
     the way they came) to his people in the towns.

  DANIEL
     Thor is generous.

  KENDRA
     Yes. This means we are close.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra walks ahead.

  CARTER
     Daniel. She said that hours ago. Now either she's
     lost and doesn't want to admit it, or--

  DANIEL
     I don't think that she would mislead us.

  CARTER
     Maybe it's not on purpose, maybe it's not even
     conscious!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel jumps over a channel to stand in front of
     Carter and they stop.

  CARTER
     What she suffered on her world and while being a
     Goa'uld will translate anywhere as incredible
     abuse.

  DANIEL
     Doesn't the fact that she interpreted those gusts
     of wind and thunder as signs mean something?

  CARTER
     Part of her wants to face it all again and another
     part clearly doesn't, and it looks like the part
     that doesn't is winning. We're wasting valuable
     time here.

  DANIEL
     Okay. Gairwyn said that hunters found her. Well
     hunters don't necessarily travel in a straight
     line. They follow game. They would not risk hunger
     just to get her back a day sooner.

  CARTER
     Daniel, your belief that Kendra can somehow help
     bring Sha're back to you, it doesn't make it true.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks off.

  CARTER
     (calls after him) And it certainly doesn't make
     her reliable!

  DANIEL
     (turns back to Carter) Haven't you ever had a
     feeling that made absolutely no logical sense, and
     it turned out to be right?

  KENDRA
     (shouting from a distance) This way!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel jumps over to middle walkway, the one
     Kendra was on. Carter and Daniel jog to catch up.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c round a corner, flashlights on.

  O'NEILL
     You sure we didn't come this way before?

  TEAL'C
     We have not.

  O'NEILL
     It looks awfully familiar.

  ANNOTATION
     Unas appears at other end of tunnel and moves
     towards them.

  UNAS
     Your weapons cannot kill me! I know the secrets of
     the Labyrinth. I could help you escape.

  O'NEILL
     A map would be nice.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c open fire. Unas, wounded again,
     staggers back into another tunnel.

  O'NEILL
     C'mon!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c go back the way they came. Unas
     gets up and follows them.


LOCATION--CIMMERIA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Dirt hill strewn with pieces of wood.

  KENDRA
     (pointing up hill) There.

  ANNOTATION
     They go up the hill and look at a carving affixed
     to a rock wall. It looks just like the top of the
     Hammer in front of the Gate.

  DANIEL
     (points up) The Hammer.

  ANNOTATION
     The Hammer is above the cave entrance.

  KENDRA
     Yes, this is where I came out.

  CARTER
     Okay, good. What do you remember about the
     Labyrinth?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves toward the entrance.

  KENDRA
     It's difficult, my beast wandered forward and back
     many times. I do remember the place of entrance
     where Thor speaks to the Goa'ulds.

  DANIEL
     Thor is inside?!

  KENDRA
     He seems to be. But he speaks the same message
     again and again. My beast believed he was not
     real. There were long tunnels, leading from one
     room to another. And...something else in there,
     something...alive.

  DANIEL
     What?

  KENDRA
     I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel exchange a look.

  DANIEL
     Look, you don't have to go any further if you
     don't want to, okay?

  ANNOTATION
     Kendra nods. It thunders.

  KENDRA
     Thor asks that I try.


LOCATION--HALL OF MJOLLNIR

  ANNOTATION
     Large open room lit by candles in bowls hanging
     from the ceiling by chains. There is a carving
     (snakes?) above the doorway. Teal'c and O'Neill
     enter. At the other end is a doorway shaped like
     the Hammer. O'Neill goes through. Teal'c looks at
     the doorway. O'Neill comes to a carved door in the
     chamber beyond that swings open as he approaches.
     He looks out around the door.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. This is it! We're outta here, let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c steps into the hammer doorway and is
     trapped in a beam of red light. The carved door
     shuts. Teal'c yells in pain.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, get outta there!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c can't move so O'Neill tackles him, knocking
     him back through the doorway. The Hammer shuts
     off.

  TEAL'C
     Thank you, O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a growl. We see Unas' shadow through the
     entrance to Hall of Mjollnir.

  TEAL'C
     If I am to die, it will be as a warrior, facing my
     enemy.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill takes the magazine out of his gun and
     looks inside before replacing it.

  O'NEILL
     Last mag. Hell. Why not?


LOCATION--CAVE ENTRANCE, DAY

  CARTER
     It's okay, stay here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel getting ready to go in--making
     sure weapons loaded, tightening chin straps on
     helmets.

  DANIEL
     You've done enough, really.

  KENDRA
     In the temple we were taught that fear is the
     greatest enemy. I must face my fear.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods, Daniel looks back at Carter. Looking
     out from cave as Carter, then Kendra, then Daniel
     enter.


LOCATION--HALL OF MJOLLNIR

  ANNOTATION
     Unas steps into the doorway.

  TEAL'C
     Are you considering the same tactic as I?

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, the clich is "Are you thinking what I'm
     thinking?" And the answer's yes.

  UNAS
     Human. You can save yourself. Why do you stay?
     (Unas enters Hall) Jaffa, why do you ally yourself
     with a slave? Once, the Goa'uld were all as Unas.
     We were few--but we ruled millions! We fed upon
     the weak to keep ourselves strong. I will take
     pleasure in killing and devouring you both!

  ANNOTATION
     Unas roars as he attacks. He throws O'Neill
     against the wall with one blow. Teal'c grapples
     with him, and when Unas is in front of the Hammer
     they both open fire.


LOCATION--JUST OUTSIDE CARVED DOOR

  DANIEL
     Gunfire.

  CARTER
     They're in trouble.

  KENDRA
     It's still alive.


LOCATION--HALL OF MJOLLNIR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c still firing. Unas right in
     front of the Hammer. He holds his arms out so he
     doesn't stagger backwards into it.


LOCATION--JUST OUTSIDE CARVED DOOR

  CARTER
     We're so close! (Daniel hits wall with shoulder)
     Feel around the door, see if there's a trigger
     somewhere.


LOCATION--HALL OF MJOLLNIR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c shoot more. Unas sinks down,
     groaning.


LOCATION--JUST OUTSIDE CARVED DOOR

  KENDRA
     There's one more thing I can try. I learned this
     from the songs of Thor's people. (moves farther
     down wall and places hands on wall, right hand in
     an outline of a hand) Carve the rune flow, read
     the might, see the rainbow, test the wight!

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens. Wall and door are covered in hand
     outlines.


LOCATION--HALL OF MJOLLNIR

  ANNOTATION
     Unas gets up and lurches forward. Teal'c rushes at
     him and pushes him into the Hammer. Unas chokes
     Teal'c--Teal'c is trapped in the beam too. Unas is
     roaring.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

  TEAL'C
     There is no other way.

  ANNOTATION
     Unas roaring in anger and pain. Carter, Daniel and
     Kendra are in the outer room and watching. O'Neill
     yanks Teal'c out of the beam. Unas is in the beam
     a few moments longer, then falls into the Hall as
     the Hammer shuts off. Teal'c kneels next to Unas
     and places a hand on his neck. Carter, Daniel and
     Kendra enter the Hall.

  TEAL'C
     Without the healing power of the Goa'uld, this
     body will no longer regenerate. There is too much
     damage.

  KENDRA
     Now I see why they call you friend.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill) This is Kendra. She brought us here.

  DANIEL
     (to O'Neill) She had firsthand knowledge; she was
     a Goa'uld.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c look at Kendra.

  DANIEL
     (gesturing to Hammer) The Hammer works. Do you
     know what this means?

  O'NEILL
     It's the only way out of here, Daniel.

  DANIEL
     But what this thing can do for Sha're and
     Skaara...

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c's here now.

  TEAL'C
     And here I will remain. I was with those who took
     the ones you love.

  O'NEILL
     No. You're part of this family now. We're not
     leaving you behind.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill picks up the staff weapon and hands it to
     Daniel.

  O'NEILL
     This thing won't work in here. Try it from out
     there.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hands Daniel the staff weapon. Daniel
     walks into the outer chamber. He raises the staff
     and pauses.

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) C'mon.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel activates the staff weapon and fires at the
     top of the Hammer. Blue lightning ricochets around
     it. Daniel lowers the staff weapon slowly, sad,
     maybe a bit regretful.

  CARTER
     Did it work?

  O'NEILL
     There's one way to find out.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures for Teal'c to go ahead. Teal'c
     pauses right before stepping through Hammer. He
     walks slowly through then turns to look back at
     it. He moves to stand beside Daniel.

  TEAL'C
     Thank you, Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gives the staff weapon to Teal'c.

  DANIEL
     Well at least we know it can be done, right?


LOCATION--CIMMERIA'S STARGATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Kendra walk around the Hammer.

  KENDRA
     Now that the Hammer is lost, I'm not sure what
     we'll do.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, you should be all right. The Goa'uld don't
     know the Hammer was destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is standing next to the Hammer.

  CARTER
     Seal up the cave. If they come back at least
     they'll be put somewhere safe.

  KENDRA
     I want to thank you for helping me have the
     courage to face my greatest fears.

  ANNOTATION
     She opens a pouch and takes out a rune stone.

  KENDRA
     This is...to remember our world.

  ANNOTATION
     She gives the stone to Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.

  TEAL'C
     We will never forget.

  CARTER
     And we'd like to come back.

  DANIEL
     Oh! (running to the MALP) I almost forgot.
     (retrieves Sagan box and hands to Kendra) Here.
     It's a gift. Actually it's for Thor, or his people
     in case they ever come back. It's all about our
     people, who we are, that we would like to be
     friends.

  ANNOTATION
     It thunders. They all look up.

  KENDRA
     Thor is pleased.

  O'NEILL
     That's great. Tell him we'd love to meet him
     someday. In person.

  KENDRA
     (nods) It is safe for you to travel, you should go
     now.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you want to start dialing home. Before it
     starts raining?

  DANIEL
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel goes to the DHD, O'Neill and Carter
     following, and starts dialing. Kendra and Teal'c
     look at each other for a moment. Kendra is
     smiling. They nod to each other. Teal'c goes to
     join the rest of SG-1 by the DHD. We watch SG-1
     enter the wormhole from a distance on a slight
     hill. Several men are scattered about, watching.
