<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>DANIEL: We don't think the Goa'uld built the Stargate system. Being parasitic by nature, they just used it to become a dominant race in the galaxy. But some of the good gods, who liked humans, might have used it too, and they could still be out there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Any indication of who they are?</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>DANIEL: Yes, sir. The Vikings. (taps button on laptop to bring up pictures of Norse mythology) Now in Norse mythology the gods were powerful warriors. Legend tells us that the god Thor was a friend to humans and protected them from the Etins, being of great power and knowledge who were enemies of mankind. He used a weapon called Thor's Hammer. Now when Thor hurled the hammer, uh, it supposedly produced thunder and--and lightning. Now that could indicate some sort of, uh, advanced type of energy weapon.</td></tr>

As the wormhole boils out, the men shield their faces with their arms and one man runs off. SG-1 tumbles out, the men laughing at them.</td></tr>
