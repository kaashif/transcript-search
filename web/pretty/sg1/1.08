The Nox
TEASER

LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate inner circle turns, five chevrons
     already lit. At the base of the ramp, an SG team
     stands ready.

  TECHNICIAN
     Stargate in motion!

  HARRIMAN
     Chevron six encoded.

  ANNOTATION
     In the control room, Harriman sits at the
     computer. Behind him General Hammond, in a dress
     uniform, stands with an older man in a civilian
     suit. Behind them are Teal'c, Daniel Jackson, Jack
     O'Neill and Samantha Carter. O'Neill and Carter
     are also in dress uniforms.

  HAMMOND
     Better hang on to something, Mr. Secretary. This
     is how we open the front door around here.

  HARRIMAN
     Chevron seven...launched.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate opens with a kawoosh.

  SECRETARY
     (awed) My God, General, it's...

  HAMMOND
     I thought you might be impressed.

  SECRETARY
     What exactly am I looking at?

  CARTER
     (stepping to his side) We think you're looking at
     the event horizon of an artificially created
     wormhole, through our space time to a
     point...tens, even hundreds of light years away.
     Sir.

  SECRETARY
     Uh-huh.

  HARRIMAN
     SG-5, your mission is go for standard recon.

  SECRETARY
     And do we know where they're going?

  HAMMOND
     The planet's designation is P3C-117.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leads the Secretary to the star chart on
     the wall.

  SECRETARY
     Do you have any idea what's out there?

  O'NEILL
     No, sir. That would be why we're going.

  SECRETARY
     I'm not sure, Colonel, is it? Because to be
     perfectly frank this administration is not
     satisfied with the current progress of the
     Stargate program.

  ANNOTATION
     The SG-1 teammates exchange concerned glances.

  CARTER
     Begging the secretary's pardon, sir, but we've
     already visited nineteen separate worlds.

  HAMMOND
     I believe he is referring specifically to the
     volume of technology being retrieved on our
     planetary missions.

  SECRETARY
     The President and Joint Chiefs were under the
     impression that the SG teams would be bringing
     back superior technologies.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel comes forward.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry, I...I thought we were explorers.

  SECRETARY
     Oh, you are Dr. Jackson. But even Marco Polo when
     he came back from the Far East brought back more
     than just a few...exotic spices.

  O'NEILL
     Mr. Secretary, it's been my observation that
     whether it's here on Earth or...out there;
     cultures with advanced technology tend not to like
     to share it.

  SECRETARY
     So. We're wasting our time.

  O'NEILL
     (to an open-mouthed Carter) Would you interpret
     what I just said as...

  HAMMOND
     (sharply) Colonel!

  CARTER
     Sir, with respect, this program is quite probably
     humanity's most important endeavor.

  SECRETARY
     They said the something about the Apollo program.
     They brought back moon rocks. You may have noticed
     we haven't been to the moon in twenty-five years.

  O'NEILL
     What kind of comparison is that?

  SECRETARY
     Colonel, if one of those Goa'uld ships were coming
     here right now, have you brought back one thing we
     can fight them off with?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill raises his chin stubbornly.

  TEAL'C
     What technologies do you seek?

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone turns to look, surprised, at Teal'c.

  SECRETARY
     You tell me, what's out there?

  TEAL'C
     There are still technologies even the Goa'uld
     seek. There is a creature that lives on an
     unpopulated world. It possesses powers of
     invisibility.

  SECRETARY
     (interested) Invisibility. As in stealth?

  TEAL'C
     That is correct. It can appear or disappear at
     will. I was once commanded to retrieve the
     creature, to learn its secrets. Apophis took the
     lives of two of my men as punishment for failure
     to retrieve it.

  CARTER
     If we manage to capture one alive, it could
     provide us with a serious tactical advantage the
     next time we came up against the Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     Sounds like a mission to me.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE


LOCATION--PLANET P3X-774--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The world is green, covered with mountains wrapped
     in a thick mist. Birds chirp in the background. A
     FRED unit sits at the base of the Stargate
     platform. O'Neill comes through alone. Thunder
     rumbles in the background.

  O'NEILL
     Carter? Daniel? Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill cocks his gun. Carter approaches him from
     behind.

  CARTER
     Here, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill follows Carter past the Gate to where
     Teal'c and Daniel wait.

  O'NEILL
     What have we got?

  CARTER
     I thought I saw something just as we came through,
     sir.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c? Did we score already?

  TEAL'C
     I saw movement as well. This way.

  ANNOTATION
     They follow Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     (looking at his gun) I hope these things are as
     big as you say they are. There's enough
     tranquilizer in these darts to knock out a rhino.

  TEAL'C
     They are very large, but extremely maneuverable in
     the air. We will find them most vulnerable when
     they hover.

  DANIEL
     (startled) Hover? Like a hummingbird?

  TEAL'C
     With teeth.

  O'NEILL
     All right, well there's nothing out here. Let's
     get back to the gear and...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks behind them and stops.

  O'NEILL
     Where's the Stargate?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Teal'c and Carter turn around. The
     Stargate has vanished.


LOCATION--PLANET--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and Teal'c walk back to
     the clearing where the Stargate had been.

  O'NEILL
     I don't like this.

  DANIEL
     (to Teal'c) Did anything like this ever happen to
     you before?

  TEAL'C
     It has not. If we became misdirected and needed to
     locate the Stargate, we had a Goa'uld homing
     device to find it.

  DANIEL
     (raising his voice) Do we have a homing device?

  O'NEILL
     (flatly) Of course we do; it's with the gear.

  DANIEL
     Which is...by the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     Yup. Captain, let's start a box search. You and
     Teal'c take off in that direction. Stay in radio
     contact.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you're with me.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel walk through a meadow. There is
     a strange fluttering noise coming from off to the
     side. Daniel hears it and stops.

  DANIEL
     Psst. Pssst.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel raised a hand towards O'Neill as he hisses.
     O'Neill turns around and walks back. They look
     through the trees as the noise becomes louder.

  DANIEL
     (whispering) There!

  ANNOTATION
     There's a sort of warping in the air, as if a
     giant...something is hovering just above the tree
     line. The men move closer, crouching in the
     underbrush. O'Neill raises the tranquilizer gun.

  DANIEL
     I just hope it becomes visible once we tranq it,
     otherwise we'll never be able to find it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill raises the gun to shoot, but before he
     can, the flash of a staff weapon comes from
     somewhere below them. The shot is aimed at the
     creature, which takes off.

  O'NEILL
     (into radio) Teal'c, what the hell are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter are also crouching in
     underbrush.

  TEAL'C
     (lowly) It did not come from me.

  ANNOTATION
     Several Jaffa run into sight as O'Neill and Daniel
     watch. They edge forward for a closer look,
     observing as the leader, clad in gold armor,
     orders the Jaffa away.

  O'NEILL
     Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     The figure in gold turns. It's Apophis.


LOCATION--PLANET--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are in the forest, talking.

  TEAL'C
     You are certain it was Apophis?

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah.

  DANIEL
     (impatiently) Okay, what are we going to do? We
     have to do something.

  O'NEILL
     That's not our mission.

  DANIEL
     Ah, just...forget our mission. (intense) Now, he's
     the only one who knows where Sha're and Skaara
     are. We may not get another chance like this.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill studies Daniel for a moment.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) What kind of entourage is he going to
     have with him?

  TEAL'C
     Two, perhaps three Jaffa personal guard.

  CARTER
     Are we seriously entertaining the idea of going
     after Apophis? (off O'Neill's nod) Sir, we're not
     prepared for an attack! Half the ordinance we're
     carrying is tranquilizer guns.

  DANIEL
     So...we use one of them to knock him out. He will
     wake up in a holding cell without his guards,
     without his technology, he will have no choice but
     to tell us everything we want to know about
     Goa'uld technology, about were Sha're is.

  O'NEILL
     Can I remind you that we don't know where the
     Stargate is?

  TEAL'C
     He will have the Goa'uld homing device I spoke of.

  DANIEL
     There you are.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) All right, you know what were up
     against better then anyone. Can we do what Daniel
     is talking about?

  TEAL'C
     We have the element of surprise. I have my staff
     weapon. If we eliminate his personal guard
     quickly, I believe so.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, this character used to be a god to you.
     You're sure you're okay with this?

  TEAL'C
     I am okay.

  O'NEILL
     Okay. Carter?

  CARTER
     If we're going to do this, we better plan the
     attack very carefully.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis and his Jaffa walk down a path through the
     forest. A noise sounds overhead.

  APOPHIS
     Jaffa.

  ANNOTATION
     The First Jaffa, Shak'l, goes forward, the other
     Jaffa stop to flank Apophis. Shak'l stops, bending
     down to study a print on the ground. Shak'l
     stands, raising his staff weapon. Teal'c jumps out
     and shoots with his staff. Shak'l ducks and the
     blast hits some rocks. As the other Jaffa run to
     help. Carter pops up from behind a rock, shooting.
     Apophis raises the arm containing the mechanism
     for his personal shield as Daniel joins the
     firefight, also shooting from behind a rock.
     O'Neill approaches Apophis from behind, raising
     the tranquilizer gun. He shoots just as Apophis
     engages the shield. Apophis sneers.

  APOPHIS
     Kree ta'k.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the Jaffa throws his staff weapon to
     Apophis. As O'Neill starts firing his revolver at
     the Goa'uld. Apophis catches the staff weapon,
     aims and fires at O'Neill. O'Neill is hit in the
     back as he dives for cover, and falls to the
     ground. Carter and Daniel turn to look.

  CARTER
     Colonel!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter jumps out from behind her rock, moving
     toward O'Neill. Apophis sees her and shoots her in
     the chest. Carter falls. Daniel tries to make his
     way over to Carter, is spotted and shot by Apophis
     in the torso. He falls down the small slope,
     coming to rest at the bottom, unmoving. Teal'c
     jumps up, still shooting. He manages to shoot
     Shak'l, and fires at Apophis. The personal shield
     absorbs the staff blasts.

  APOPHIS
     Teal'c. Jaffa Shol'va!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at each of his teammates, lying dead
     where they fell, smoke still rising from their
     wounds. He lowers his weapon.

  TEAL'C
     Tal shakka mel. I die free.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis smirks with satisfaction as he looks at
     the dead members of SG-1. He aims his staff weapon
     to kill Teal'c, but with a strange sound, Teal'c
     is suddenly gone. Apophis looks around wildly; all
     of the bodies have vanished.


LOCATION--PLANET--SMALL HUT--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is lying on a flat surface, there is a hole
     in his uniform in the middle of his chest, right
     where he was shot. His clothing around the hole is
     charred and bloody, but there is no wound on his
     exposed skin. Daniel's eyes open slowly, he looks
     around the hut before he sits up with a gasp, his
     hands going to the wound that no longer exists.
     Daniel rises, moving around the hut and
     discovering Carter. Daniel places a hand over her
     face to see if she is breathing; satisfied that
     she is, he places his hand in the hole where she
     was shot, and feels around for the wound. Carter
     wakes up with his hand on her chest.

  CARTER
     Hey! What are you looking at?

  DANIEL
     I felt that blast kill me. I mean...I thought
     I...I thought we were dead. Weren't we dead?

  CARTER
     (pushing herself up) Yeah.

  DANIEL
     Okay. Well I thought heaven would be a little more
     upscale.

  CARTER
     Oh, I don't think this is heaven.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gets up and they both walk across the hut
     to O'Neill, who is lying on his stomach. There is
     a hole in the back of his uniform, but the skin
     underneath is unmarked. Carter feels his skin
     where the wound was while Daniel pats his hair.

  DANIEL
     Jack?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel places his hand on O'Neill's head. O'Neill
     jumps up.

  O'NEILL
     What? God.

  DANIEL
     It's okay.

  O'NEILL
     What the hell was that?

  DANIEL
     It's okay.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill feels his back, confusion crossing his
     face.

  O'NEILL
     Wasn't I just...

  CARTER
     Killed.

  O'NEILL
     Killed as in...

  CARTER
     Dead.

  O'NEILL
     Dead.

  CARTER
     Yeah. We know we saw it happen. Same thing
     happened to us.

  O'NEILL
     Oh. This is a surprise then.

  DANIEL
     I don't know what happened to Teal'c.

  CARTER
     Colonel, my sidearm's gone.

  O'NEILL
     So's mine.

  ANNOTATION
     A small man, Opher, with greenish, bushy hair,
     clad in baggy clothing of what looks like
     homespun, natural fibers walks into the hut.

  DANIEL
     Ah...hello.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman, Lya, joins the man. She is slightly
     taller than Opher, but is wearing a dress made of
     the same type of material. Her hair is slightly
     lighter, more red than green, but just a bushy.
     Both regard O'Neill, Carter and Daniel silently.

  DANIEL
     Hi. I'm Daniel...uh, Jackson. This is Captain
     Carter and this is...uh...

  O'NEILL
     Colonel Jack O'Neill, SG-1. Um...Sorry to drop in
     on you like this but we were...dead.

  CARTER
     Do you know where our friend is? (motions to her
     uniform) Another like us.

  ANNOTATION
     Lya motions for them to follow her, then walks out
     of the hut. Opher smiles and follows. O'Neill,
     Daniel and Carter look at each other then follow.


LOCATION--PLANET--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The hut they exit is small and round, set in a
     clearing in the middle of the forest. There are
     two smaller huts behind it. They all seem to be
     constructed of sticks and grass.

  DANIEL
     Is this your village? Aresh? Tao Aki? We need to
     find our friend Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     Opher and Lya walk to two others of their family,
     another man, Anteaus, and a young boy sitting on a
     tree trunk bench, surrounded by colorful flowers
     and green shrubbery. There are several baskets
     full of bright fruit.

  O'NEILL
     Ah...fruit. Nothing like coming back from the dead
     to build up an appetite.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Daniel and Carter sit on the bench across
     from the small family. Anteaus throws Jack a small
     red fruit.

  O'NEILL
     Ah...Oh, thank you...Thank you very much.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus throws one to Daniel then Carter.

  DANIEL
     Did you do this?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel points to where the staff wound was in his
     stomach. No one answers.

  DANIEL
     Did you heal us?

  ANNOTATION
     Across from them, the small group trade seemingly
     confused glances, then motion to their food,
     indicating that SG-1 is welcome to have more
     fruit.

  DANIEL
     (softly, to Jack) I think they're a family.

  O'NEILL
     Of what?

  DANIEL
     I have no idea.

  O'NEILL
     Well, we should ask them to give us back our
     weapons.

  ANNOTATION
     As Carter nods, the small boy approaches O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, hi. Um...listen. Uh, those things you found on
     us, those, um, things you took from us? The big
     things. They're very dangerous and...

  ANNOTATION
     The boy runs off.

  O'NEILL
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     In turning to watch the boy, O'Neill spots Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c! Thank God.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill rises to meet Teal'c, who is walking
     toward them with the boy holding his hand.

  O'NEILL
     Please tell me you know what's going on around
     here.

  TEAL'C
     I cannot tell you that.

  O'NEILL
     What about Apophis, you got a line on him?

  TEAL'C
     I do not.

  O'NEILL
     Any idea how far away from the Stargate we might
     be?

  TEAL'C
     I believe us to...

  ANNOTATION
     Something catches Teal'c's attention. He and
     O'Neill turn to watch the boy approach Carter. The
     boy points to himself.

  NAFRAYU
     Nafrayu.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles and puts her hand on Nafrayu's
     chest.

  CARTER
     Nafrayu?

  ANNOTATION
     As Nafrayu nods, Carter points at herself.

  CARTER
     Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Nafrayu places his hand on Carter's shoulder.

  NAFRAYU
     Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Nafrayu gazes at Carter adoringly. Carter grins at
     him.

  O'NEILL
     No, you can't keep him.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter tries to hold back her grin.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  APOPHIS
     Jaffa! Jot'keen! Tee'ka!

  ANNOTATION
     Behind him, the Jaffa guard leaves promptly.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus is cooking some sort of porridge. He
     scoops some out with a wooden spoon into a cup
     made out of a leaf. He holds it out toward the
     team, who sit beside the fire watching him.
     O'Neill taps Daniel on the arm; Daniel accepts the
     offered food.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe you should ask them about the Stargate.

  DANIEL
     I have; they don't understand. Actually they don't
     really say much at all. At the moment I'm trying
     to figure out if they're human.

  CARTER
     (looking down at Nafrayu, sitting beside her)
     They're fairly human.

  ANTEAUS
     I will take you to your doorway.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks taken aback at the sound of his
     words. Daniel's mouth drops open.

  O'NEILL
     Whoa.

  DANIEL
     You understand what I'm saying?

  ANTEAUS
     (nodding) It took time to learn your speech.

  CARTER
     Not much time.

  ANTEAUS
     Your weapons are gone.

  O'NEILL
     Gone where?

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus takes a bite of his food, looking evasive.

  CARTER
     You know about our enemy?

  O'NEILL
     The bad guys? They'll be following us.

  LYA
     You attacked them.

  ANNOTATION
     The teammates appear surprised as she joins the
     conversation.

  DANIEL
     You saw?

  CARTER
     We only meant to capture him.

  O'NEILL
     Look, um...we're not in the assassination
     business.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus and Lya look curious.

  O'NEILL
     He's just...bad. He's very...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks to Daniel for support.

  DANIEL
     ...bad.

  O'NEILL
     ...bad. We just wanted to take him back to our
     world and have a little chat with him about all
     the nasty... DANIEL and O'NEILL ...bad...

  O'NEILL
     ...things he's been doing. Looking toward Teal'c)
     We just didn't know about this little force field
     deal...

  TEAL'C
     I have never seen such a device, if I had...

  O'NEILL
     It's all right. We're alive. Thanks to you folks.

  ANTEAUS
     (solemnly) We will take you to your doorway. You
     will go.

  CARTER
     As in...the Stargate?

  LYA
     Yes. You will go?

  O'NEILL
     Well, it's not quite that simple.

  TEAL'C
     By rescuing us, you have put yourselves in great
     danger. Apophis will try to locate us.

  ANTEAUS
     Rest now, you will leave soon. Take your ways with
     you.

  O'NEILL
     No, wait, wait, wait. Um...you helped us.
     You...saved us.

  ANTEAUS
     Yes.

  O'NEILL
     How?

  ANTEAUS
     Our ways.

  DANIEL
     We're from a race of people that want to learn
     about your ways. Your medicine.

  ANTEAUS
     No.

  O'NEILL
     Is there anyone else we could talk to? Do you have
     a leader?

  ANTEAUS
     They have no wish to see you.

  O'NEILL
     So there are others.

  ANTEAUS
     (firmly) You will go.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus walks away.

  O'NEILL
     Right...We'll go.

  TEAL'C
     If you wish us to leave, should we not depart now?

  LYA
     Your brother won't revive until later.

  ANNOTATION
     Lya hands O'Neill a bowl of the porridge and moves
     to follow Anteaus.

  O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

  ANNOTATION
     Lya stops and turns around.

  O'NEILL
     Whose brother?

  ANNOTATION
     Lya beckons for them to follow her. Rising to
     their feet, they do so.

  O'NEILL
     Brother?


LOCATION--NOX HUT--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Following Lya, SG-1 enter a hut very similar to
     the one in which they awoke. Lya moves to a
     corner, pulling aside a curtain. On the bed is
     Shak'l, one of Apophis' Jaffa, asleep.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 follow Lya out of the hut.

  LYA
     He resisted our attempts to help him heal.

  TEAL'C
     He may yet survive. The Goa'uld he carries is
     healing him even now.

  ANTEAUS
     That is good.

  O'NEILL
     How is that good? I mean, he's in the service of
     the Goa'uld.

  ANTEAUS
     (nods toward Teal'c) He is like him.

  O'NEILL
     He's with us.

  LYA
     Perhaps you can convince the injured one to join
     you as well?

  CARTER
     Oh, I don't think so.

  DANIEL
     The Goa'ulds are a...parasitic race. They take
     life and use it for their own purposes.

  O'NEILL
     And their ways are not like your ways, believe me.

  ANTEAUS
     They do not know the Nox.

  DANIEL
     That's you? The Nox?

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus nods.

  LYA
     The ones you speak of come to hunt the Fenri.

  O'NEILL
     Fenri. What..?

  DANIEL
     That's probably that disappearing, invisible,
     flying thing we were after.

  ANTEAUS
     Yes. Fenri.

  O'NEILL
     All right, look. Um...do you have any...elders...I
     could speak with? I don't think you're
     understanding what I'm...

  ANTEAUS
     Opher is one of the eldest of the Nox.

  ANNOTATION
     The older man they met first smiles at them.
     Anteaus crosses over to him and pulls Opher to his
     feet.

  TEAL'C
     (to O'Neill) If Shak'l does not die, they will be
     in even greater danger than they are now.

  ANTEAUS
     (sternly) There will be no more death.

  ANNOTATION
     Lya rushes over to touch him, comforting.

  TEAL'C
     I have no intention of killing him. However, if
     Shak'l survives his injuries he will tell the
     Goa'uld where to find you.

  O'NEILL
     Look, obviously your medicine is very...Well it's
     very effective. But how do you defend yourselves?

  ANTEAUS
     We don't.

  CARTER
     But at least let us help you in exchange for what
     you did for us.

  ANTEAUS
     You must go.

  O'NEILL
     Right. Well for now, we'll just go over here. (He
     points) Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks to the opposite side of the
     clearing, his team follows.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) All right, do you know this...Shackle?

  TEAL'C
     He served in my command when I was first prime of
     Apophis.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill winces, closing his eyes.

  CARTER
     Well, we can't just walk away. I mean, if we
     hadn't attacked Apophis, he wouldn't even be here.

  DANIEL
     And we can't kill him either.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter whips around to look at him with
     astonishment, as do Teal'c and O'Neill.

  DANIEL
     (defensively) I wasn't...considering it. I was
     just...stating a fact.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, we'll take Shak'l back. It's not quite as
     good as having Apophis, but he can't stay here.

  TEAL'C
     Apophis will not allow us to leave this world
     alive. You have challenged him, and I have
     betrayed him. Even if we were to locate the
     Stargate, leaving this world will be difficult.

  CARTER
     So we're back to square one. We can't leave Shak'l
     here and we'll never get him back to the Gate
     without running into Apophis.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, we'll try and find out as much as we can
     about the Nox; it's part of why we came here
     right?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel nod. O'Neill turns to Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     In the meantime, I think you better check on your
     friend. Whatever we end up doing, I don't think he
     is going to wake up in a very good mood. Know what
     I mean?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pats Teal'c on the back. Teal'c walks off.


LOCATION--PLANET--FOREST CLEARING--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa runs, staff weapon in hand, toward Apophis
     and a second Jaffa.

  JAFFA
     Apophis. Kree. Shal'tak.

  APOPHIS
     Teal'c was standing before me, waiting to pay the
     price of his betrayal, I had him in my hand!

  JAFFA
     We have searched.

  APOPHIS
     Where are the other? Where is Shak'l? I saw them
     die, they could not just disappear. Unless they
     have learned the power of the beast.


LOCATION--NOX HUT--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Inside the hut where Shak'l sleeps, Teal'c is
     standing guard. Shak'l's wrists are tied together.
     Lya enters and reaches out toward the binding,
     looking dismayed.

  LYA
     Must he be bound so tightly?

  TEAL'C
     If not, he will escape when he awakens.

  LYA
     He deceives you; he's awake now.

  ANNOTATION
     Lya leaves. Teal'c watches her go, then turns to
     Shak'l.

  TEAL'C
     Were you waiting for me to turn my back, Shak'l?

  SHAK'L
     As you taught me. Have you come to kill me?

  TEAL'C
     I offer you the chance to join me. The Goa'uld are
     not gods.

  SHAK'L
     Lies.

  TEAL'C
     These people are that of the first world. The
     Tau'ri.

  SHAK'L
     You waste your breath. I shall rest, strengthened
     by the thought of the reward I shall get when I
     present your head to Apophis.

  TEAL'C
     The time of Apophis will soon end. And on that
     day, I will return to our world, and offer freedom
     to all Jaffa. It is a shame you will not live to
     see it. For when you fail to kill me, it will be
     your head.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sharpening the end of a stick into a
     point.

  DANIEL
     I really don't get the point of this.

  ANNOTATION
     O'NEILL walks up with a hand made bow.

  O'NEILL
     Well, if we run into Apophis again, we'll be
     prepared.

  DANIEL
     But what good are bows and arrows going to be
     against that kind of fire power?

  O'NEILL
     Exactly how I want him to think.

  DANIEL
     Yeah..?

  CARTER
     Any weapon is better then no weapon when it comes
     to survival.

  DANIEL
     You guys just don't want to give up, do you?

  O'NEILL
     No.

  CARTER
     That's what happens when you spend half your life
     in Special Forces.

  DANIEL
     Somehow I don't thing we'd make very good Nox.

  O'NEILL
     I think you're right.

  ANNOTATION
     Nafrayu approaches.

  NAFRAYU
     Is that a weapon?

  O'NEILL
     Yes. And you can't have it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets up abruptly and walks away. Nafrayu
     gazes after him, then runs to follow.


LOCATION--CLEARING IN FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill tests out his bow and arrow. He draws back
     the bow, aiming for a stump. The arrow hits.
     Nafrayu runs after it and pulls it out. He hands
     it to O'Neill.

  NAFRAYU
     If you blunted this stick, this would be good for
     knocking fruit from the highest branches.

  O'NEILL
     (taking back the arrow) Yeah, I bet it would.

  NAFRAYU
     Why do you want to fight them?

  O'NEILL
     I don't want to.

  NAFRAYU
     Then don't.

  O'NEILL
     (hesitating) It's not that simple. Look, I believe
     in peace, just like you. I do.

  NAFRAYU
     Then why do you fight?

  O'NEILL
     Because our enemy gives us no option. Sometimes
     turning the other cheek just doesn't work.

  NAFRAYU
     I'll learn to understand them better.

  O'NEILL
     No! I wouldn't do that if I were--.

  ANNOTATION
     A Fenri suddenly appears above them, completely
     visible and looking like it's going to attack.

  O'NEILL
     Go on, run. Run!

  ANNOTATION
     Nafrayu runs off, O'Neill tries to shoot the Fenri
     with his bow and arrow. The Fenri darts away
     though, and the arrow falls to the ground.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Opher rubs his fingers down a tree trunk,
     gathering sap. He licks his fingers then offers
     some to Daniel.

  OPHER
     Mmm. You?

  DANIEL
     Uh, no. Thank you. I'm...I'm trying to quit. Is
     that where you get your medicine? From the forest?

  OPHER
     We get life from the forest. From everything.

  DANIEL
     But you must have medicine. Or you must have some
     knowledge that we don't have,

  ANNOTATION
     Opher walks away, looking focused on something
     else. Daniel follows.

  DANIEL
     I guess what I'm saying is, we could learn a lot
     from you, I really wish that we could be friends
     with the Nox. Friends share knowledge with each
     other.

  OPHER
     Yes, you have much to learn.

  ANNOTATION
     Opher motions for Daniel to follow, which he does.

  DANIEL
     Well, why...why don't you teach me now? For
     example, you seem to have an almost psychic
     ability. Are you born with it?

  OPHER
     Knowledge takes time. Over the years we teach the
     young to be wise.

  DANIEL
     Um...

  OPHER
     How old am I? How do you mark time?

  DANIEL
     Umm...years, days? Ah, a day is one revolution of
     our planet; a year is one revolution around our
     sun. There are 365 days in one year so...

  OPHER
     (thoughtfullly) Then, I am four hundred and
     thirty-two years old.

  ANNOTATION
     Opher turns to Daniel, who is staring at him.

  DANIEL
     Well, ah...You look great.

  OPHER
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Opher walks off.


LOCATION--FOREST CLEARING--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill standing by himself, bow in hand. He
     appears to still be looking for the Fenri. Anteaus
     materializes out of thin air. O'Neill looks at him
     in astonishment.

  ANTEAUS
     You will not teach Nafrayu your ways.

  O'NEILL
     How'd you do that?

  ANTEAUS
     It is not the Fenri that have the ability to hide.
     It is the Nox.

  O'NEILL
     So you hid the Stargate?

  ANTEAUS
     The Fenri was nearby when you came through,
     attracted by your arrival. We conceal them from
     the hunters who come.

  O'NEILL
     We're not hunters.

  ANTEAUS
     You tried to kill the Fenri just a moment ago.

  O'NEILL
     I was trying to protect the boy.

  ANTEAUS
     You protect his body after poisoning his mind?

  O'NEILL
     Will you listen to me? The reason the Goa'uld hunt
     those flying things is because they want to know
     how it's able to disappear. If they find out it's
     you...

  ANTEAUS
     Our ways have served us for as long as our people
     have lived.

  O'NEILL
     But they didn't know you existed before. Once they
     know, they'll enslave you. It's what they do!

  ANTEAUS
     (calmly) We are slaves to no one.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is still following Opher as he continues on
     his way through the forest.

  DANIEL
     How long have the Goa'uld been coming here to
     hunt?

  OPHER
     Oh, as long as I can remember.

  DANIEL
     Why did you not bury the Stargate? Do you know
     that that would stop them?

  OPHER
     (nods) Then they would know someone had buried it.

  DANIEL
     Right. Of course.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill approaches Daniel and Teal'c, who are
     standing together by one of the huts. Carter is
     sitting at one of the Nox tables.

  DANIEL
     Opher is 432 years old.

  O'NEILL
     Well, guess what? They're not human.

  DANIEL
     No. Ah...humanoid, but definitely more advanced
     than anything that has evolved on Earth.

  O'NEILL
     That creature that we came here for? It has no
     power at all. None. Zip.

  CARTER
     Well then, how does it become invisible?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks over his shoulder at the Nox.

  O'NEILL
     They do it. The Nox hide it from us.

  DANIEL
     They make it invisible to protect it?

  CARTER
     Well, this makes things even worse.

  DANIEL
     If Apophis finds out that it's them that has this
     power...

  TEAL'C
     He will try to possess it. If he finds he cannot,
     he will bombard this planet's surface from high
     above. What he cannot possess, he destroys.

  O'NEILL
     So, we have to get Shak'l out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus appears beside them. O'Neill jumps, Daniel
     starts back, Carter sits up straighter. Teal'c
     appears unsurprised.

  ANTEAUS
     We will not allow you.

  O'NEILL
     Geez! Will you stop doing that!

  ANTEAUS
     You cannot be trusted with your enemy.

  O'NEILL
     Look, if we don't take him away from here, he'll
     tell the Goa'uld--the bad guys--all about you.

  ANTEAUS
     We are not afraid.

  O'NEILL
     Well, get afraid!

  DANIEL
     (warning) Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel holds a hand out toward O'Neill, who looks
     disapproving. Daniel stands up beside Anteaus.

  DANIEL
     Look, this is our fault that this has happened. We
     know that and we want to correct that.

  CARTER
     Shak'l won't be hurt, you have our word.

  DANIEL
     We will just...take him away with us, back to our
     planet. Only then will you be safe.

  ANTEAUS
     Only if that is his wish.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis strides down the path, preceeded by a
     Jaffa. They meet with another.

  APOPHIS
     Jaffa! Ma'kree?

  JAFFA

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis clenches a hand in frustration.

  APOPHIS
     (menacing) Then find me Teal'c.


LOCATION--NOX HUT--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c hovers over Shak'l's bed.

  TEAL'C
     Jaffa, I offer you this last chance to join me.

  SHAK'L
     Before you kill me? You are too much of a coward
     or you would have done it already.

  TEAL'C
     I have no wish to kill you.

  SHAK'L
     You may wish you had.

  ANNOTATION
     Shak'l starts to scream, his voice hoarse. Lya
     rushes into the hut.

  LYA
     What have you done to him?

  ANNOTATION
     Shak'l suddenly breaks lose of his bonds. Looking
     alarmed, Teal'c pushes Lya out of his path. Shak'l
     then pulls out a knife hidden in his armor and
     stabs Teal'c. He turns to stare at Lya, who backs
     away from him.


LOCATION--FOREST CLEARING--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus is sprinkling something on the ground. In

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c are sitting on a log, Carter is
     cleaning Teal'c's wound. O'Neill and Daniel are
     standing nearby, watching the hut.

  DANIEL
     Where'd the Nox go with Lya?

  O'NEILL
     Who knows where they ever go?

  TEAL'C
     I trained him well.

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Is he going to be all right?

  CARTER
     Well, if it were you or me...

  TEAL'C
     My wound will heal. We must find Shak'l.

  O'NEILL
     We will.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a strange noise, and a shimmer in the
     air. O'Neill and Daniel turn to see Lya laying on
     a table, with the rest of the Nox standing over
     her. Their hands are crossed, their eyes closed.
     They fade in and out of view. Across from them, in
     another part of the forest, Shak'l also watches
     the healing take place. When the view of them
     becomes stable, Lya slowly blinks and opens her
     eyes. She sits up, looking tired, and smiles when
     comforting hands touch her shoulders. Shak'l also
     smiles, and continues on his journey.

  ANNOTATION
     Opher and Nafrayu lead Lya into one of the Nox
     huts as Anteaus approaches O'Neill and Daniel.

  O'NEILL
     You...brought us back the same way?

  ANTEAUS
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter join them.

  TEAL'C
     You become visible during the ceremony.

  ANTEAUS
     When we are performing the ritual of life we are
     unable to shield ourselves.

  TEAL'C
     A weakness.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus nods in affirmation.

  ANTEAUS
     We are hidden again.


LOCATION--FOREST PATH--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c squats on the ground, studying a footprint.

  TEAL'C
     Shak'l has been this way.

  O'NEILL
     How long ago was he here?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c doesn't answer, looking around.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

  TEAL'C
     He is very skilled at evading capture.

  O'NEILL
     Did you teach him that too?


LOCATION--ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Shak'l runs thought the forest.


LOCATION--FOREST NEAR NOX CAMP--DAY

  NAFRAYU
     I am curious to see a Goa'uld. I have never seen
     one.

  O'NEILL
     No. You should go some place where it's safe. Go
     where the other Nox are.

  NAFRAYU
     They are far away.

  O'NEILL
     Nafrayu, please, go on. Scoot. Kids.

  ANNOTATION

     Nafrayu has vanished.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis journeys down a path with his two
     remaining Jaffa. They pause when they hear Shak'l

  APOPHIS
     Go!

  ANNOTATION
     He indicates that one of the Jaffa should find
     Shak'l.

  SHAK'L
     Niss Trah! Niss Trah!

  ANNOTATION
     In the forest above, Teal'c and O'Neill pause,
     also hearing the shouts. They spot Shak'l below
     them, just as the Jaffa approaches.

  SHAK'L
     Niss Trah!

  ANNOTATION
     There are indecipherable words as the two Jaffa
     converse. Teal'c, however, can understand them.

  TEAL'C
     He is telling about the Nox...about their powers.
     Apophis will be pleased.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANTEAUS
     Nothing has changed for us.

  O'NEILL
     No, everything has changed.

  ANTEAUS
     We will take you to the doorway.

     Look, Anteaus, we can came back through that Gate.
     We'll bring reinforcements.

  OPHER

     Apophis smiles and holds up his hand, the ribbon
     device glowing.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel follow Anteaus as they help
     search for Nafrayu.

  O'NEILL
     I told him to go home.

  ANTEAUS
     I told you the same. The very young do not always
     do what they are told.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel stare at him, then look at each
     other.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c follow Lya, also looking for
     Nafrayu. Lya begins to run. Nafrayu is in a
     crumpled heap on the ground, half on a log. As Lya
     bends over the motionless body, Anteaus, O'Neill
     and Daniel approach. O'Neill immediately starts
     looking around the clearing. Carter already has
     her weapon up and ready.

  O'NEILL
     Feel like a trap to you, Captain?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus picks up Nafrayu, Lya touching his leg. He
     stops only to glare at O'Neill. SG-1 follows the
     Nox as Anteaus carries Nafrayu through the forest
     to the Nox Camp. Opher takes Nafrayu and lay him
     on the bed on which Lya was brought back to life.

  LYA
     We must begin the ritual.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus stops SG-1 from approaching.

  O'NEILL
     No, wait.

  DANIEL
     Jack, they can bring him back.

  TEAL'C
     Shak'l has told Apophis of your ritual...that you
     cannot remain hidden when you perform it.

  ANTEAUS
     (soberly) But we must.

  O'NEILL
     The minute you start that ritual, they'll attack.

  CARTER
     Give us our weapons, we can defend you.

  ANTEAUS
     There will be no killing.

  O'NEILL
     All right, fine. We'll find our own way back to
     the Stargate; we're certainly not going to sit
     around here and watch a slaughter.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stares at the Nox for a moment, then turns
     to leave.

  O'NEILL
     Let's go.

  DANIEL
     Jack!

  O'NEILL
     That's an order.

  DANIEL
     Please, we were just...We were trying to help.

  ANTEAUS
     Goodbye, Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Looking discouraged, Daniel follows the rest of
     his team, catching up as they leave the vicinity
     of the Nox camp.

  O'NEILL
     Think they bought it?

  CARTER
     Almost believed it myself.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  LYA
     We could take Nafrayu to the others.

  ANTEAUS
     It would take too long.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus and Lya join Opher, and they begin the
     ritual.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill wraps string around a small object,
     binding it to what looks like a blowdart.

  DANIEL
     Where did that come from?

  O'NEILL
     Well, the wee folks missed one. So Shak'l thinks
     we're unarmed, Apophis thinks he's invulnerable.

  DANIEL
     And...they're right? I think I found the flaw in
     your plan.

  O'NEILL
     Their weapons aren't as effective in close, we'll
     be better off with hand-to-hand.

  TEAL'C
     What of Apophis? He is protected by an energy
     field. We both fired our weapons directly at it.

  O'NEILL
     Did you see what happened when one of his guards
     tossed him a staff weapon?

  CARTER
     Passed right through. So you're guessing that the
     shield's deflection capability is directly
     proportional to the amount of kinetic energy being
     directed at it?

  O'NEILL
     (too quickly) Yeah.

  DANIEL
     So you're saying that an arrow or a dart being
     much slower in velocity than, say, a bullet...

  CARTER
     Just might make it through. It's a big gamble,
     sir.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. You ready?


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The flames climb higher as the Nox work their
     magic on Nafrayu.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is on the ground, covered with leaves and
     branches. Daniel is places more forest debris over
     him.

  DANIEL
     They're coming.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel signals to Teal'c, who is hiding behind a
     tree. He lifts a large log in preparation. Apophis
     and the Jaffa walk toward them. Daniel peeks out
     from behind a tree, judging their approach.
     Apophis sends two Jaffa ahead. As the first one
     approaches, Teal'c steps out and slams the log on
     to the first Jaffa's head, knocking him down. From
     a camouflaged spot, Carter kicks the second Jaffa
     in the crotch, felling him. Teal'c hits his
     victim, knocking him out. Grabbing the staff
     weapon, he throws it to Daniel, who aims and
     fires. He hits the third Jaffa. Apophis engages
     his personal shield.


LOCATION--NOX CAMP--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Nox stop their ritual at the sound of weapons
     fire. Lya and Opher stop, then both look to
     Anteaus. Anteaus, refusing to look toward the
     sound, takes Lya and Opher's hands and contines
     with the ritual.


LOCATION--FOREST--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is flipped over a Jaffa's back in the
     fight, and ends up with a staff weapon pointed
     right at her face. Before the Jaffa can fire,
     Daniel shoots him in the chest. Apophis, seeing
     that his Jaffa are all down, backs into the woods,
     his personal shield still on. As he turns to flee,
     O'Neill comes up behind him, the arrow with it's
     special surprise nocked and ready to fire.

  APOPHIS
     Fool. I will kill you.

  O'NEILL
     Again?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shoots at Apophis. There is a strange
     sound, and Apophis vanishes just before the arrow
     hits him.

  O'NEILL
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks around the forest, shouting to the
     invisible Nox.

  O'NEILL
     They'll be back! They won't spare you!


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING--DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c, Daniel and Carter climb over the
     ridge. The Stargate is still missing.

  TEAL'C
     This is where the Stargate should be.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus appears in front of them.

  ANTEAUS
     We sent your enemy through the doorway.

  O'NEILL
     They'll be back.

  ANTEAUS
     When you are gone, we will bury it.

  O'NEILL
     They'll come in ships next time; they'll bring an
     army.

  ANTEAUS
     Perhaps.

  ANNOTATION
     Nafrayu appears next to Anteaus, alive and well.

  ANTEAUS
     He wanted to wish you farewell.

  O'NEILL
     I'm glad you're okay.

  NAFRAYU
     And you. We sent your weapons back through the
     doorway.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, speaking of the Stargate...

  ANTEAUS
     You fear for us, yes?

  O'NEILL
     Yes.

  ANTEAUS
     Why?

  TEAL'C
     It is our way that the strong defend the weak.

  O'NEILL
     We're afraid for you.

  ANTEAUS
     Before you go, O'Neill, there is something we
     would have you see.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus waves his hand. Behind them, up in the
     sky, a floating city appears.

  O'NEILL
     Oh my God.

  ANTEAUS
     Fear not.

  ANNOTATION
     Several Fenri circle the city, and the Stargate
     appears. There is a kawoosh, despite the lack of
     anyone pushing the DHD. They turn to see the
     Stargate, the wormhole already engaged.

  ANTEAUS
     Maybe one day you will learn, that your way is not
     the only way.

  ANNOTATION
     Anteaus and Nafrayu vanish. O'Neill looks from the
     spot they were standing back to the floating city.

  O'NEILL
     Why didn't he tell us about this before?

  DANIEL
     I think, in their way, they did.

  ANNOTATION
     The city vanishes.

  TEAL'C
     It appears they possess a form of technology far
     greater than that of the Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     They looked so helpless...

  DANIEL
     And now they're going to bury the Stargate, and we
     can never come back. We should've listened.

  O'NEILL
     'The very young do not always do as they're told.'

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Teal'c and Carter stare at O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Just a little something the Nox told me one time.
     Something worth taking home.

  ANNOTATION
     They head into the wormhole, going home.
