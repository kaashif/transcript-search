<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Mr. Secretary, it's been my observation that whether it's here on Earth or...out there; cultures with advanced technology tend not to like to share it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>SECRETARY: Colonel, if one of those Goa'uld ships were coming here right now, have you brought back one thing we can fight them off with?</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>TEAL'C: That is correct. It can appear or disappear at will. I was once commanded to retrieve the creature, to learn its secrets. Apophis took the lives of two of my men as punishment for failure to retrieve it.</td></tr>
