O'Neill gestures to Teal'c to let him know he is going to look below. O'Neill walks away from his team, toward another area where slightly larger crystals are clustered. They too, are broken, but the pieces remaining seem to be larger than the crystals Daniel and Carter found. In the middle of the broken crystals, one large, complete one stands alone...it seems to be almost three feet tall, and about eight inches in diameter. It is surrounded by shards of smaller crystals. O'Neill cautiously approaches it.</td></tr>
