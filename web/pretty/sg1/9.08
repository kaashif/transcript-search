Volnek starts choking Mitchell from behind, but Mitchell shoves him backward into a tree and elbows him hard. Free for a moment, Mitchell moves on his knees, grabs Volnek's staff weapon, turns, and shoots Volnek in the abdomen. (The staff weapon is smaller than the typical Jaffa weapon, but has the same type of fire.) Volnek falls onto his back. Then Mitchell sways and falls forward, unconscious.</td></tr>
