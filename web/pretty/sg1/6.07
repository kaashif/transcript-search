LOCATION--STARGATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate has been activated from off world. The
     iris is in place, and the klaxon alarms sound.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, followed by Carter, descends the stairs
     to the Control Room.

  SGT. DAVIS
     We're receiving a transmission sir. Audio only.

  HAMMOND
     Let's here it.

  ANNOTATION
     Garbled, high-pitched sounds can be heard over the
     speakers. Carter sits at a terminal next to Sgt.
     Davis.

  CARTER
     I'll see if I can clean it up.

  VOICE OVER SPEAKERS
     Please respond. Repeat, this is Commander Hale,
     chairman of the Kelownan Defense Council, calling
     Stargate Command. Please respond.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns to look back at Hammond.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  CARTER
     At approximately 0700 this morning, we received a
     transmission from

  P2S-4C3.


  HAMMOND
     The man identified himself as Commander Hale,
     Chairman of the Kelownan Defense Council.

  JONAS
     Well, he's been promoted. When I left, he was
     Undersecretary for Military Appropriations.

  CARTER
     Well, according to their commander, the Kelownan
     government wants to reestablish trade relations
     with Earth.

  O'NEILL
     I hope you diplomatically told him where to shove
     it.

  HAMMOND
     It's not that simple, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     They tried to frame Daniel.

  JONAS
     I don't think it's fair to judge the entire
     population by the actions of a few scientists.

  TEAL'C
     The Kelownans are technologically inferior to
     Earth. They have little to offer.

  CARTER
     Except naquadria.

  O'NEILL
     Which...doesn't work.

  CARTER
     The hyperspace drive on the X-302 didn't work.
     That doesn't mean we should give up. Naquadria is
     still our best bet for creating shields and
     weapons capable of repelling the Goa'uld. We need
     this.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks disgusted.

LOCATION--JONAS' LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is pacing, agitated, as Teal'c knocks and
     enters.

  TEAL'C
     The Kelownan delegation will arrive soon.

  JONAS
     Yeah.

  TEAL'C
     Is there a problem, Jonas Quinn?

  JONAS
     I've just been, uh...so caught up in being a
     member of SG-1, I kinda forgot how this whole
     thing started.

  TEAL'C
     We have taken similar paths. I, too, was forced to
     betray all of that in which I had placed my faith.

  JONAS
     I don't know if I can do it, Teal'c. I mean, they
     think that I'm a...a traitor.

  TEAL'C
     When I returned to Chulak after leaving the
     service of Apophis, I, too, was considered a
     traitor, Sholva, to my friends and family that I
     had left behind. In their eyes, I was dead.

  JONAS
     It must have been hard for you to go back.

  TEAL'C
     What I did, I did for my people. In time, they
     came to understand this.

  JONAS
     Well...I don't think my people are ever gonna have
     a chance to know the truth.

  TEAL'C
     Then you must draw strength in knowing that your
     cause is just...and one day your people will
     benefit from the sacrifices that you have made.


LOCATION--STARGATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A delegation of three steps through the Gate from
     Kelowna. They walk down the ramp to be greeted by
     Hammond and SG-1.

  HAMMOND
     Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond.

  HALE
     I'm Commander Hale. This is Ambassador Dreylock
     and Dr. Kieran.

  HAMMOND
     This is Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, Teal'c...

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran nods his head slowly towards Jonas.

  HAMMOND
     ...and of course you know Jonas Quinn.

  JONAS
     It's good to see you, Professor.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas' smile fades as Kieran ignores him.

  KIERAN
     General, I believe we have a lot to discuss.

  HAMMOND
     Right this way.

  ANNOTATION
     As the others leave, O'Neill and Jonas remain in
     the Gate room. Jonas looks towards the exiting
     delegation.

  O'NEILL
     Friend of yours?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas nods, obviously upset.

  JONAS
     He was, uh, one of my teachers at university and
     then he recruited me into the naquadria project.
     We've been working together side by side the last
     six years.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill steps around Jonas to leave the Gate room.
     Jonas follows.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Kelownans are standing at the Briefing Room
     table.

  HAMMOND
     Please, sit down.

  ANNOTATION
     The Kelownans and SG-1 sit.

  HAMMOND
     I must admit that we were a little surprised to
     hear from you given the circumstances of our last
     encounter.

  DREYLOCK
     I'm sure we all regret what happened, but I don't
     think anything was said or done to damage
     relations between us irreparably.

  O'NEILL
     You accused a member of my team of sabotage to
     cover up your own incompetence.

  HALE
     And you received stolen goods and are harboring a
     traitor.

  DREYLOCK
     Perhaps it would be better if we focused on the
     matter at hand.

  HAMMOND
     Which is what, exactly?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Hale glare at each other.

  DREYLOCK
     For several years, an uneasy peace has resulted
     from the rivalry between the three major powers on
     our planet--Kelowna, Tirania and the Andari
     Federation. All of that is about to change.

  HALE
     According to our foreign intelligence service, the
     Tiranians and the Andaris are about to sign a
     non-aggression pact. This would leave us in a very
     vulnerable position.

  O'NEILL
     I'm just curious. What made you think we would
     care?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter appears disgusted at O'Neill's attitude.

  KIERAN
     We still have something that you want, Colonel.
     Naquadria.

  DREYLOCK
     In fact, thanks to recent discoveries, we have a
     considerable surplus.

  KIERAN
     We know that you're decades ahead of us,
     technologically. In the field of jet propulsion
     alone, you could provide us with a significant
     strategic advantage.

  CARTER
     You want us to give you military technology.

  HALE
     Without it, Kelowna faces annihilation.

  TEAL'C
     You are assuming they intend to attack.

  HALE
     The treaty is an obvious prelude to war. If we
     wait for them to make the first move, we won't
     stand a chance.

  O'NEILL
     See, we've been down this road before.

  CARTER
     On a previous offworld mission, we encountered a
     race known as the Eurondans. They were losing a
     war and they offered us technology in exchange for
     our help. We then discovered that they were guilty
     of attempted genocide.

  DREYLOCK
     I hardly think this situation compares. All we
     want is to protect our people.

  HAMMOND
     I understand, but given our past experience, we
     are reluctant to interfere in the affairs of
     another planet.

  DREYLOCK
     According to Mr. Quinn's original report, you
     regularly interfere in the affairs of a race known
     as the Goa'uld.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that's...a little different.

  CARTER
     The Goa'uld enslave millions of people across the
     galaxy.

  HALE
     If you were to provide us with the means for a
     quick and decisive victory, you could potentially
     save hundreds of thousands of lives. If not, we
     would have no choice but to fall back on our last
     resort.

  DREYLOCK
     Dr. Kieran and his team have successfully tested a
     naquadria bomb. Its destructive power was beyond
     all expectations. If you do not help us, we will
     have no choice but to use it.


LOCATION--JONAS' LAB

  TEAL'C
     Do you believe the Kelownans are truly facing
     annihilation?

  JONAS
     Just before I left, we did a detailed projection
     based on this scenario. We calculated that the
     combined enemy forces would achieve total air
     superiority within the first five weeks of the
     war.

  CARTER
     So if the Kelownans are gonna to use the bomb,
     they'll have to do it fast.

  JONAS
     They're probably considering a pre-emptive first
     strike.

  O'NEILL
     Really?

  JONAS
     Colonel, I helped research this report. If they
     stick with conventional weapons, we are looking at
     a complete collapse of their entire military
     within six months.

  CARTER
     Can't they negotiate? I mean, what are they
     fighting for anyway?

  JONAS
     Well, there's a thousand different grievances that
     go back generations. The last major conflict we
     had was 20 years ago, nothing was resolved. The
     only difference is that in the past the Tiranians
     and Andaris hated each other more than the
     Kelownans.

  O'NEILL
     Apparently, they got over it.

  JONAS
     Oh, it's a marriage of convenience. Sooner or
     later they'll turn on each other, but by then
     it'll be too late for Kelowna.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas...you're a member of SG-1 now. Your
     priorities have changed.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas nods his head.


LOCATION--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the office.

  O'NEILL
     You wanted to see me, Sir?

  HAMMOND
     The Joint Chiefs are meeting in an hour. They're
     going to want me to give them a recommendation.

  O'NEILL
     We can't do it, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     You don't think we should help them defend
     themselves?

  O'NEILL
     I have nothing against them defending themselves
     but...how do we know they'll stop there?

  HAMMOND
     You sound like Dr. Jackson.

  O'NEILL
     We spent some time together.

  HAMMOND
     But I have to wonder if this doesn't have more to
     do with your own personal distaste for the
     Kelownans.

  O'NEILL
     Possibly, Sir...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is interrupted by alarm klaxons.

  UNKNOWN VOICE OVER INTERCOM
     Unscheduled off-world activation!


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Hammond enter and stand behind Sgt.
     Davis.

  HAMMOND
     Sergeant?

  SGT. DAVIS
     We're receiving a signal, Sir. It's the Kelownans.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Hammond exit the Control Room


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran steps through the Gate.

  HAMMOND
     Doctor Kieran.

  KIERAN
     I apologize for Ambassador Dreylock and Commander
     Hale. They were called to an emergency cabinet
     meeting. The non-aggression pact was signed an
     hour ago.

  HAMMOND
     My superiors will be meeting soon to discuss your
     situation.

  KIERAN
     In the meantime, I'd like to speak to Jonas Quinn.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond turns back towards O'Neill, who raises his
     eyebrows.


LOCATION--JONAS' LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is reading, his feet propped on a table.
     Kieran enters.

  KIERAN
     Jonas.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas closes the book and stands to face Kieran.

  JONAS
     Professor...uh, I didn't know that you were back.

  KIERAN
     So this is where you're working now.

  JONAS
     Yeah...when, uh, when I'm not off world.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas moves a stack of books and papers off a
     chair and gestures toward for Kieran to sit.

  JONAS
     Please.

  KIERAN
     (sitting) Off world...you must have seen some
     incredible things.

  JONAS
     (smiling) Yeah...you have no idea.

  KIERAN
     Well, you were always a dreamer, Jonas...but, of
     course, some of us had to stay behind to deal with
     reality.

  JONAS
     Well, I had to leave. I mean, these people have a
     much better chance of doing something useful with
     the naquadria than we ever had.

  KIERAN
     What good is that to Kelowna?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas shrugs and turns away in frustration.

  JONAS
     Well, if they can master shield technology,
     they'll share that with us.

  KIERAN
     They won't even share their most basic military
     hardware.

  JONAS
     That's because you come to them as a
     representative of only one nation. What the people
     on our planet need to do is to get over their
     differences and unite.

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran gets up and quickly closes the door to the
     lab. He walks back to face Jonas.

  KIERAN
     Do you really believe that?

  JONAS
     Of course.

  KIERAN
     Then come with me now, and we can make it happen.

  JONAS
     What are you talking about?

  KIERAN
     I couldn't say anything before because the other
     two are not part of the organization. The
     resistance.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas shakes his head and raises his hand to stop
     Kieran.

  KIERAN
     I'm a member of an underground network, Jonas.
     We've infiltrated every level of government, the
     civil service, even the military. We intend to
     stop our leaders before they take us to the brink
     of destruction.

  JONAS
     You're talking about a coup.

  KIERAN
     When the time is right, but we need your help.

  JONAS
     This is insane. I mean your telling me that you're
     part of a secret organization that is going to
     seize power from the government.

  KIERAN
     That's right.

  JONAS
     You're going to get yourself killed.

  KIERAN
     On the contrary, this is our best chance for
     survival. There's wide-spread discontent with the
     government's hard-line war policy. That's true in
     Tirania and with the Andari Federation as well.
     The people of all three countries are sick of this
     never-ending conflict, but their leaders have
     stopped listening to them.

  JONAS
     You really think you can succeed?

  KIERAN
     I was at the first test of the naquadria bomb. I
     saw the destruction. I've been having nightmares
     about it ever since. We have to succeed.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and General Hammond are around the conference
     table.

  HAMMOND
     When are they going to move against the
     government?

  JONAS
     I don't know, but if they intend to prevent a war,
     they're gonna have to do something fast.

  TEAL'C
     That will not prevent their enemies from
     attacking.

  JONAS
     According to Dr. Kieran, there's popular support
     for a negotiated settlement in all three
     countries. Now, they believe that if the
     resistance can seize power in Kelowna this will
     compel the other governments to come back to the
     table or risk similar uprisings. At the very
     least, they'll be too busy dealing with internal
     discontent to launch an attack.

  CARTER
     If they can pull it off, we might have a more
     viable trading partner.

  O'NEILL
     We need a lot more intel before we proceed with
     anything.

  HAMMOND
     The Pentagon has authorized SG-1 to return to the
     planet and offer the Kelownan government
     nonmilitary technology in exchange for naquadria.

  O'NEILL
     They'll never go for it.

  HAMMOND
     Maybe not, but we have to explore every avenue. In
     the meantime I want you to make contact with the
     resistance and determine their strength, their
     numbers and their chance for success.


LOCATION--STARGATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran is standing in the room as a number of SFs
     enter, followed by Jonas, Carter and Teal'c. Jonas
     walks up to Kieran.

  KIERAN
     Are you ready to go home?

  JONAS
     Well, I'm not expecting a parade.

  KIERAN
     Not everyone in Kelowna thinks you're a traitor.
     After you left, all of us working on the naquadria
     project began to question what we were doing. You
     opened our eyes.

  JONAS
     Anyway, it's just temporary. If I stay a minute
     after the negotiations are finished, I'll be
     arrested for treason.

  KIERAN
     That will all change after the resistance takes
     power.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the Gate room.

  O'NEILL
     All right. Let's move out.


LOCATION--KELOWNA CONFERENCE CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Three Kelownan enter the room and walk towards the
     conference table, where Teal'c is standing looking
     out of a window. O'Neill, Carter and Jonas stand

  DREYLOCK
     Hello again. I apologize for the delay but, these
     are difficult times for us. May I present First
     Minister Valis? Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, Major
     Carter...

  VALIS
     ...and Jonas Quinn. It's good to see you again,
     Jonas.

  JONAS
     Thank you, sir.

  VALIS
     Shall we?

  ANNOTATION
     They all sit, with Valis at the head of the table.

  DREYLOCK
     Have you spoken with your superiors?

  O'NEILL
     Why yes we have...they send their best.

  ANNOTATION
     Dreylock and Valis look at each other.

  CARTER
     We've been authorized to continue with the trade
     negotiations.

  VALIS
     Excellent.

  CARTER
     Before we continue...uh, there's something I'd
     like to clarify. Back on Earth, Ambassador
     Dreylock referred to recent discoveries leading to
     a surplus of naquadria.

  VALIS
     Yes, our archaeologists have discovered a series
     of mine shafts beneath the original site. We've
     managed to extract and process a considerable
     amount.

  CARTER
     How much?

  VALIS
     I thought you might be interested in the figures
     so I had it converted to your weight system. I
     believe it's something in the area of 300 pounds.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks surprised.

  CARTER
     Uh, that's an awful lot of dangerous material. If
     you like, I could take a look at your storage
     facilities. I might be able to offer some useful
     advice.

  HALE
     That won't be necessary.

  VALIS
     It's purely a matter of safety. As Major Carter
     said the naquadria is extremely dangerous and we'd
     hate for some sort of accident to happen.

  ANNOTATION
     Valis looks at Jonas.

  O'NEILL
     Mmm.

  TEAL'C
     Clearly you have more naquadria than you require.
     What, precisely, are you asking for in return?

  HALE
     We need to start by addressing a serious imbalance
     in air power. Our enemies have superior numbers in
     both strategic bombers and long-range fighter
     escorts. Our only hope to counter them is to get
     our jet interceptor program off the ground.

  VALIS
     We've had some technical difficulties with the
     program, but we have managed to successfully test
     a few designs. We believe that with the help of
     Major Carter and a team of your engineers, we can
     have a combat-ready squadron in less than a month.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that's not exactly what we had in mind.

  CARTER
     We understand from Jonas that Kelownan medical
     science currently has little or no defense against
     bacterial infections. We're offering a series of
     drugs known as antibiotics. We estimate they could
     save up to 15,000 lives in the first year alone.

  VALIS
     That's a generous offer, Major, and under
     different circumstances, we might accept. But at
     the moment, we have more pressing needs.

  ANNOTATION
     There is silence around the table.


LOCATION--DR. KIERAN'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran closes the lab door and walks towards SG-1.
     Kieran rubs his left temple.

  KIERAN
     So, how are the negotiations coming?

  JONAS
     Well, after four hours, the only thing we could
     agree on was to adjourn for the day.

  CARTER
     We're clear, Sir, no bugs.

  TEAL'C
     I do not believe the Kelownans will settle for
     anything less than military technology.

  KIERAN
     They know how much you want the naquadria and they
     think that eventually you're going to give them
     what they want.

  O'NEILL
     In the meantime, we need you to take us to
     this...resistance.

  KIERAN
     Well, it's not that simple. I don't get in touch
     with them, they get in touch with me.

  CARTER
     What exactly do you do for them?

  KIERAN
     I keep them apprised of all the top-level research
     at the Academy of Science.

  O'NEILL
     Where do you meet them?

  KIERAN
     Uhh...they have a base of operations in an old
     warehouse by the freight yards. It's very heavily
     guarded.

  O'NEILL
     Take us there.

  KIERAN
     I can't. I'm not even supposed to go there myself
     unless I have a scheduled drop.

  JONAS
     Professor.

  KIERAN
     All right. I'll...I'll talk to them.


LOCATION--KELOWNAN RESISTANCE HQ--NIGHTTIME

  ANNOTATION
     The HQ appears to be a large building, full of
     wooden crates and weapons. There are many people
     around, moving crates and setting up the weapons.
     Kieran enters and approaches a man.

  RESISTANCE LEADER
     We weren't expecting you this evening, Professor.

  KIERAN
     I'm sorry. I needed to talk to you.

  RESISTANCE LEADER
     Well, this isn't a very good time to be taking
     risks. We've had reports that some members of the
     government are beginning to question your loyalty.
     They've been watching you.

  KIERAN
     I wasn't followed.

  RESISTANCE LEADER
     Is this about the delegation from Earth?

  KIERAN
     Uh, yes, they want to meet with you.

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran rubs his left temple.

  RESISTANCE LEADER
     Well, how do you know they won't betray us to the
     government in exchange for naquadria?

  KIERAN
     I don't think they would do something like that.

  RESISTANCE LEADER
     You trust them?

  KIERAN
     I trust...Jonas.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is escorted into the room.

  JONAS
     First Minister.

  ANNOTATION
     Valis is sitting at the far end of the table. The
     room is in semi-darkness.

  VALIS
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     Valis rises as Jonas' escort leaves, closing the
     doors behind her.

  VALIS
     I wanted a chance to talk to you Jonas, away from
     the negotiations. (gestures to the seat beside
     him) Please.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks around the table and to the chair.
     Both sit.

  VALIS
     It's difficult for me, Jonas, seeing you sitting
     across the table, acting as the representative of
     another planet.

  JONAS
     It's not easy for me either. But I made my choices
     and I'm going to stick by them.

  VALIS
     I'm sure you thought you were...doing the right
     thing.

  JONAS
     Oh, I know I did the right thing. Stargate Command
     is going to use the naquadria to come up with
     technologies that may one day save this world from
     an enemy...you can't possibly imagine.

  VALIS
     You were one of the most...promising young men any
     of us had ever seen. Our people had such high
     hopes for you.

  JONAS
     You're not the only one who was disappointed.

  VALIS
     I know that you think this is...the same old bad
     blood resurfacing again. Just...just another round
     of petty violence, but it's not. This time...this
     time, Jonas, we face total defeat.

  JONAS
     Then get back to the negotiating table. Give up
     some land. You do whatever it takes.

  VALIS
     You know how much the Tiranians and the Andaris
     hate each other. Do you really think that they
     overcame 200 years of prejudice just to get us to
     give up a little land? They mean to destroy us,
     Jonas. This is merely the first step in a fight
     for world domination and the naquadria is the only
     advantage that we have. And that, is where you
     come in, my friend.

  JONAS
     I come in?

  VALIS
     You're a man of unique talents, Jonas, and despite
     what you did, I know that it's not too late for
     you to serve your country. I'm offering you a
     second chance to do that.

  JONAS
     If you're asking me to gather information about
     Earth technology, that's not going to happen. I
     will not betray my friends.

  VALIS
     On the contrary, I'm asking you to help a friend.
     Dr. Kieran hasn't been the same since you left.
     Unfortunately, the strain of completing the
     naquadria project has...has taken its toll.
     Lately, his behavior has become
     increasingly...erratic.

  JONAS
     How do you mean?

  VALIS
     We're concerned that in his current state, he may
     be prone to errors of judgment. We want someone
     to...watch over him.

  JONAS
     You mean spy on him?

  VALIS
     He trusts you, Jonas, and he's still very
     important to us. If you do this, you will be
     granted a full pardon. You will be reinstated into
     your position at the academy. Your life will
     resume as though none of this had ever happened.
     It's time, Jonas, for you to come home.


LOCATION--DR. KIERAN'S LAB--DAYTIME

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Kieran is leaning over a table, rubbing his
     forehead.

  KIERAN
     Oh, I'm tired.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks in.

  JONAS
     You've been under a lot of strain.

  KIERAN
     I can't concentrate anymore.

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran rubs both temples.

  KIERAN
     I've got these headaches and my mind wanders.

  JONAS
     It'll all be over soon.

  KIERAN
     Do you think I should take Colonel O'Neill and the
     others to meet the resistance?

  JONAS
     They can help.

  KIERAN
     I don't know if I trust them.

  JONAS
     You trust me, don't you?

  KIERAN
     Of course.

  JONAS
     Don't worry, then.

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran looks at him wearily and nods slightly.

  JONAS
     Everything's gonna be fine.


LOCATION--KELOWNA CONFERENCE CHAMBER--DAYTIME

  ANNOTATION
     The three Kelownans and SG-1 are sitting at the
     table.

  HALE
     You have surface to air missiles that are capable
     of destroying enemy bombers before they reach our
     cities.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, we do, but we can't give 'em to you.

  HALE
     It's purely a defensive technology.

  O'NEILL
     Yes. And then one day you take down enemy aircraft
     defending their cities and quite suddenly, yes,
     quite suddenly, they become not just defensive but
     offensive.

  TEAL'C
     Any superior defensive technology can ultimately
     be turned into an offensive advantage.

  DREYLOCK
     But we are not the aggressors here.

  CARTER
     You said you wanted a quick and decisive victory.
     Now, we can only assume that that means you intend
     to press any advantage that we give you.

  VALIS
     Yes. As a means of saving lives.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman enters.

  WOMAN
     First Minister?

  VALIS
     Excuse us a moment.

  ANNOTATION
     The three Kelownans rise and walk away from the
     table to speak to the woman.

  O'NEILL
     (to Jonas) This is proving quite fruitless.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas shrugs.

  O'NEILL
     Have you spoken with your professor?

  JONAS
     No, I haven't seen him today.

  ANNOTATION
     Valis turns back toward the conference table.

  VALIS
     We've just received intelligence that the
     Tiranians are massing their troops on our northern
     border.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Jonas rise.

  CARTER
     Have they broken off diplomatic relations?

  DREYLOCK
     Not yet.

  CARTER
     Well, then, there's still a chance. Maybe we could
     talk to them.

  VALIS
     You?

  CARTER
     Well, Stargate Command has teams of skilled
     diplomats. It might help to have an objective
     third party at the table.

  VALIS
     No. I'm afraid that's impossible.

  CARTER
     Why?

  HALE
     That would require us to reveal the existence of
     the Stargate.

  CARTER
     Maybe that's not such a bad idea. Once they
     realize the kind of advancements they can acquire
     through peaceful negotiations, they may not be so
     eager to attack.

  DREYLOCK
     You are asking us to reveal something to our sworn
     enemies that we have yet to admit to our own
     people.

  JONAS
     Looks like it's time you did. Think about it. If
     everybody knew that this was just one in thousands
     of inhabited planets, don't you think that they
     would start focusing on their similarities instead
     of their differences?

  VALIS
     That's a noble sentiment, Jonas. Of course, if it
     were that simple, I'm sure the existence of the
     Stargate would be public knowledge on Earth, as
     well. Isn't that right, Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.


LOCATION--DR. KIERAN'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran is pacing agitatedly. There is a loud knock
     at the door.

  KIERAN
     Who is it?

  JONAS
     Professor, it's me.

  KIERAN
     Jonas?

  JONAS
     Yeah, Professor, open up.

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran opens the door to SG-1.

  JONAS
     Is something wrong?

  KIERAN
     Ahh...it's Tomis. Tomis Leed, he's another one of
     the scientists on the naquadria project.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill closes the lab door.

  JONAS
     Yeah. What's wrong with him?

  KIERAN
     He was transferred over night. They cleaned out
     his office and they won't say where he went.

  CARTER
     Was he a member of the resistance?

  KIERAN
     I recruited him myself. God, now I'm gonna get
     arrested.

  JONAS
     No. We don't know that.

  KIERAN
     This is not the first time it's happened. About a
     month ago it was Dr. Silas. They said he was
     transferred as well and he hasn't been seen or
     heard from since. We were the three original
     members of the project. Now, I'm the only one
     left.

  O'NEILL
     All right. We're outta here.

  KIERAN
     You're leaving?

  O'NEILL
     The negotiations are going nowhere, you're not
     helping us and quite frankly, your...organization
     is about to be exposed.

  KIERAN
     Wait! We're gonna make our move in two days, but
     we need your help.

  TEAL'C
     What are you proposing?

  KIERAN
     We're in a position to take every major government
     building in this city except one. This one. This
     is their most heavily guarded facility.

  CARTER
     Because of the Stargate.

  KIERAN
     That's right. But you people can come and go as
     you please. You could get a hundred armed men in
     here before anyone knew what happened. You could
     take the building from the inside and you wouldn't
     have to fire a shot!

  O'NEILL
     Not a chance.

  KIERAN
     Think about it. If you want this coup to succeed,
     it has to be quick; it has to be as bloodless as
     possible. If we try to take the building
     ourselves, we'll get caught in a drawn-out
     firefight and the whole thing could dissolve into
     a civil war.

  O'NEILL
     Not my problem.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns to leave.

  KIERAN
     There's something else. Over the past three
     months, I've been smuggling small amounts of
     naquadria into the resistance. We've built up a
     considerable stockpile. If you help us, it's
     yours. At least talk to them. I'll set up a
     meeting.


LOCATION--KELOWNA INDUSTRIAL AREA--DAYTIME

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran is walking alongside a building when he is
     grabbed from the side by Jonas.

  KIERAN
     Jonas! What are you doing here?

  JONAS
     You're being followed.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas points down the narrow alley where they're
     standing.

  JONAS
     This way.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas leads Dr. Kieran until they come to the end
     of the building. Jonas stops Dr. Kieran from going
     around the corner and checks that the way is
     clear.

  JONAS
     How far is it to resistance headquarters?

  KIERAN
     It's just down that way.

  JONAS
     Show me.

  ANNOTATION
     A voice suddenly yells out from back down the
     alley

  MAN
     You there! Don't move!

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas and Kieran start running as the man fires a
     gun at them then runs after them. Jonas follows
     Kieran up a staircase, turning to fire at the man
     following them. They run through a building and on
     to stairs on an outside platform. They can go no
     further and the man following them fires more
     shots. As Kieran ducks to avoid them, he slips
     from the platform but grabs at a bar. Jonas shoots
     the man who is attacking them and he falls.

  KIERAN
     Jonas!

  JONAS
     Professor!

  ANNOTATION
     As Jonas reaches for Kieran, Kieran's grip slips
     and he falls many feet to the ground. Back on the
     platform, no one is there.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Fraiser and Hammond are looking down on Kieran
     from the observation area. Kieran is in a bed, his
     head bandaged.

  HAMMOND
     What's his condition, Doctor?

  FRAISER
     Well, sir, he has a severe fracture to his left
     tibia, but it's the blunt trauma to the head that
     worries me. We'll keep him under observation for
     now.

  HAMMOND
     Any idea how it happened?

  FRAISER
     According to the Kelownans, he was found lying in
     a deserted street. No one knows how he got there.
     Apparently Jonas was the one who convinced them
     he'd have a better chance of recovery with us.

  HAMMOND
     Keep me posted.

  FRAISER
     Yes, Sir.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  HAMMOND
     What, exactly, are the Kelownans saying?

  O'NEILL
     Not much.

  CARTER
     They claim to have no knowledge of how Dr. Kieran
     was injured.

  TEAL'C
     And yet, he did have fear he was under threat from
     the government.

  CARTER
     Yeah, but if they suspected that he was some kind
     of rebel spy, they would never have let us bring
     him back here.

  O'NEILL
     His own people may have tried to take him out if
     they felt he had been compromised.

  HAMMOND
     The question is, what do we do now? Do we go back
     to the table?

  O'NEILL
     Sir...

  JONAS
     General...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Jonas look at each other. O'Neill
     gestures for Jonas to continue.

  JONAS
     ...with all due respect, if we terminate
     negotiations now, we're going to be backing them
     into a corner. The way they see it, they'll have
     no other choice but to launch a preemptive first
     strike with the naquadria bomb.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas. We're gonna have to do it sooner or later.
     We can't give 'em what they want.

  JONAS
     Well, what about the resistance? If we can help
     the resistance seize power, we'll still get the
     naquadria, plus we'll be saving millions of lives.

  O'NEILL
     Even if we wanted to, realistically, there's no
     way we could find them.

  CARTER
     Actually sir, that's not exactly true.

  HAMMOND
     Major?

  CARTER
     Well, if Dr. Kieran really did smuggle naquadria
     to the resistance headquarters, I can track it.


LOCATION--KELOWNA INDUSTRIAL AREA--DAYTIME

  CARTER
     This is where they found Dr. Kieran.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is holding a sensor device which beeps as
     she points it in different directions.

  CARTER
     I'm picking something up. This way.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Kieran wakes up to see Jonas sitting next to
     him.

  JONAS
     Professor?

  KIERAN
     Jonas, where am I?

  JONAS
     You're safe.

  KIERAN
     We need to get to the resistance, they need our
     help.

  ANNOTATION
     Kieran tries to rise, but Jonas stands to stop
     him.

  JONAS
     It's all right, it's all right. Everything's going
     as planned. We'll be making contact soon.

  KIERAN
     We have to stop the First Minister from using the
     bomb.

  JONAS
     We will. We will.

  KIERAN
     I never meant for it to turn out this way, Jonas.
     We were scientists. We thought we were pursuing
     knowledge. We had no idea what we were creating.

  JONAS
     It's not your fault.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks into the infirmary and up to
     Fraiser, who is sitting at a terminal.

  HAMMOND
     You have something, Doctor?

  FRAISER
     Yes, sir. These are Dr. Kieran's PET scans. It
     shows no sign of brain damage from the injury, but
     there is something else. These images are
     consistent with someone suffering from advanced
     schizophrenia.

  HAMMOND
     Dr. Kieran's one of Kelowna's leading scientists.
     He's the head of their most top-secret program.

  FRAISER
     I know, I can't explain it. The onset of this
     disease is extremely rare over the age of 35.

  HAMMOND
     That would mean he's been functioning for at least
     20 years without anyone noticing his condition.

  FRAISER
     It's almost inconceivable.

  HAMMOND
     What kind of symptoms are we talking about here?

  FRAISER
     Paranoia, delusions, possibly even full-blown
     hallucinations.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is sitting at Kieran's bedside.

  KIERAN
     I'm glad you weren't there the day we tested the
     bomb, Jonas.

  JONAS
     It must have been hard for you.

  KIERAN
     I'll never forget it. The ground shook, the air
     caught fire, the destruction was unimaginable.

  ANNOTATION
     In the observation room, a monitor shows Kieran
     lying in the bed. Through the observation window,
     Jonas can be seen sitting next to him, but there
     is no sign of Jonas on the monitor. Kieran is
     imagining that Jonas is sitting next to him.


LOCATION--KELOWNA CONFERENCE CHAMBER--DAYTIME

  ANNOTATION
     Commander Hale is pointing at a map on the table
     and talking to First Minister Valis.

  HALE
     The Tiranian central forces are located here.
     We'll move the third division and the reserves to
     this point.

  VALIS
     How long can we resist?

  JONAS
     First Minister?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks into the room, flanked by two guards.

  JONAS
     We need to talk.


LOCATION--KELOWNAN RESISTANCE HQ

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Teal'c, and O'Neill approach a building.

  CARTER
     This way, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The area and the building have obviously been
     abandoned for a very long time.

  CARTER
     In here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Teal'c and O'Neill walk in to the building
     and look around.

  O'NEILL
     Carter, you sure?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir. This is the place.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is scanning the area.

  CARTER
     Over here, sir. (lifts the lid of a crate)
     Naquadria. A lot of it.

  ANNOTATION
     The crate contains several containers.


LOCATION--KELOWNA CONFERENCE CHAMBER--DAYTIME

  HALE
     We must defend ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is standing, leaning on the conference table
     at the opposite end from Hale and Valis.

  JONAS
     You're going to use the naquadria bomb, aren't
     you?

  HALE
     If Earth will not help us, we have no choice.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks towards Hale and Valis.

  JONAS
     I wish you could see what I've seen. I have
     actually been on board a Goa'uld mothership. I've
     seen their destructive power. They can park in
     orbit and systematically annihilate every major
     city on our entire planet, regardless of who's
     Kelownan or Tiranian. To them we're all just
     potential slaves.

  VALIS
     Jonas, the Goa'uld haven't been here for a
     thousand years. What makes you think they would
     come back now?

  JONAS
     The naquadria is a derivative of naquadah, which
     is the very basis of their technology. It's
     literally in their blood. They can smell it. If
     you continue using it, I guarantee you,
     eventually, they will take notice.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the room.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas. We're leaving.

  JONAS
     (to Valis and Hale) Just...wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks back to talk quietly with O'Neill.

  JONAS
     What happened?

  O'NEILL
     Carter and Teal'c are back at the SGC already.

  JONAS
     What about the resistance?

  O'NEILL
     There is no resistance. It was all in his head. A
     fantasy.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas shakes his head in disbelief.

  JONAS
     That's impossible.

  O'NEILL
     This is from Fraiser. Dr. Kieran is schizophrenic.
     It might be a side effect of the research they've
     been doing here.

  JONAS
     The naquadria...

  O'NEILL
     It's time to go home.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas motions for O'Neill to wait just a moment
     and turns to go back to the other end of the
     table.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas...

  JONAS
     (to Valis and Hale) What happened to Dr. Silas and
     Dr. Leed?

  ANNOTATION
     Valis and Hale look at each other.

  JONAS
     They weren't transferred, were they?

  VALIS
     They were taken to a government mental facility,
     Jonas.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas points at Valis accusingly.

  JONAS
     You knew.

  VALIS
     No. We suspected. We had thought that Dr. Silas
     was a unique case, but when Dr. Leed began to
     exhibit similar behavior, we became concerned.

  JONAS
     That's why you wanted me to keep an eye on him.

  HALE
     We had to keep it quiet, so as not to alarm the
     other scientists. Their research is too important.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  FRAISER
     As near as I can tell, it's a unique form of brain
     damage resulting from long-term exposure to
     naquadria radiation.

  CARTER
     I went over the specs from the Kelownan bomb
     project. It looks like they never had proper
     shielding.

  HAMMOND
     Is Jonas at risk?

  FRAISER
     No. I've already tested him. He's negative. My
     guess is, he didn't have enough exposure.

  HAMMOND
     The Pentagon is eager to resume our own research
     on the naquadria you found in the warehouse.

  FRAISER
     That shouldn't be a problem, sir. I mean we are
     double-checking, but I think that our existing
     safeguards are sufficient.

  CARTER
     I sent a message to the Kelownans detailing the
     risk and offering our help to upgrade their
     facilities. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any
     response.

  HAMMOND
     In fact, we've heard nothing from the Kelownans
     since Colonel O'Neill and Jonas returned.

  TEAL'C
     They may well be at war by now.

  JONAS
     What about Dr. Kieran?

  FRAISER
     With proper medication, we can keep his condition
     from deteriorating. Unfortunately, there's no way
     to reverse the damage that's already been done.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks and stands next to Dr. Kieran's bed.
     He can be seen on the observation room monitor. A
     nurse is taking Kieran's pulse.

  KIERAN
     Jonas.

  JONAS
     Professor.

  KIERAN
     I hear I'm being moved today.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas sits at Kieran's bedside.

  JONAS
     Yeah. We're gonna to take you to a...facility
     that's better equipped to deal with your needs.

  ANNOTATION
     When the nurse leaves his side, Dr. Kieran leans
     in to speak more quietly to Jonas.

  KIERAN
     I understand everything is in place for the coup.

  JONAS
     Really?

  KIERAN
     They're keeping me informed.

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Kieran looks up and sees the Resistance Leader
     standing in the observation area. The Leader nods
     his head to Kieran. Jonas follows his gaze to look
     up at the observation area, but sees no one.

  KIERAN
     After they take power, the resistance is going to
     dismantle the bomb, and shut down the naquadria
     project forever.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas smiles sadly and nods at Dr. Kieran.

  JONAS
     That's good, Professor. They couldn't have done it
     without you.

  KIERAN
     Do you really think so?

  JONAS
     I know so. You saved the world.
