TEASER

LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and General Hammond are watching a monitor,
     showing a tropical world.

  CARTER
     The probe indicates a sustainable atmosphere.
     Temperature 78 degrees Fahrenheit. Barometric
     pressure is normal.

  DANIEL
     No obvious signs of civilisation.

  CARTER
     P4X 884 looks like an untouched paradise, sir.

  TEAL'C
     Appearances may be deceiving.

  O'NEILL
     One man's ceiling is another man's floor.

  DANIEL
     A fool's paradise is a wise man's hell.

  O'NEILL
     Never run with...scissors?

  HAMMOND
     Were you trying to make a point, Major?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir. We should perform a standard recon
     mission. Mineral and biological surveys to
     determine if 884 is a viable site for a research
     colony.

  HAMMOND
     Very well. You have a go.

  O'NEILL
     Mmmm, mineral survey. My favourite.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     I know, General. It's all fun and games until
     someone breaks a nail.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate dials up and the wormhole opens. SG-1
     enters the Gate room while Hammond watches from
     the Control Room.

  O'NEILL
     (to Hammond) Au revoir mon General.

  TEAL'C
     I am unfamiliar with that term, O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     They head up the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Au revoir. It's French. It means ciao.
     Ciao...means adios, auf weidersehen, sayonara,
     which all loosely translated means...

  ANNOTATION
     They step through the Stargate.

LOCATION--GATE ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 steps out of the Stargate back into the Gate
     room. Hammond and a group of armed soldiers are
     waiting at the bottom of the ramp, along with two
     MALPs.

  O'NEILL
     (cont'd) Goodbye?

  HAMMOND
     (to soldiers) Stand down. (to SG-1) What happened?

  O'NEILL
     (confused) What happened?

  HAMMOND
     That's what I just asked you. Will someone please
     explain?

  CARTER
     General, we just left. We went through the Gate
     and we came back...here.

  HAMMOND
     Major, you've been gone over fifteen hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks shocked.

  END OF TEASER



LOCATION--INFIRMARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Dr Fraiser checks SG-1's medical results on a
     monitor.

  FRASIER
     Blood work is normal. So far you check out fine.

  DANIEL
     What about the lost time?

  CARTER
     Could we have been drugged with something that
     leaves no trace?

  FRASIER
     Externally, there's no new marks or bruises on
     your skin to indicate injections or any kind of
     struggle. What's the last thing you remember?

  CARTER
     We were walking up the ramp.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill was explaining the meaning of ciao.

  O'NEILL
     We stepped through, we stepped back through.
     That's what happened as far as we're concerned.

  HAMMOND
     When you didn't come back on schedule, we sent a
     second MALP. But all it showed was the same image
     of the alien planet we saw before. There was no
     sign of you and no response to our radio call.

  CARTER
     That's why there were two MALPs in the Gate room
     when we came back.

  HAMMOND
     Both came back just before you arrived. We assumed
     you sent them.

  CARTER
     It wasn't us, sir.


LOCATION--DEBRIEFING ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is sitting before a television. She
     switches a video recording on.

  CARTER
     This is the mark two MALP's transmission.

  ANNOTATION
     The scene shows the tropical planet the first MALP
     showed.

  HAMMOND
     That's what we saw, Major.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir. Same as the first. Except where is it?
     If this is the second MALP's transmission, we
     should be able to see the first MALP somewhere
     here, near the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     Isn't that thing supposed to...probe a little?

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a mug and the coffee pot over to the
     table and pours a cup for Daniel.

  CARTER
     Well then there'd be tracks, sir. And there are
     none, at least nowhere in this image. Watch what
     happens when you run the play back frame by frame.

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor is very blurred, but shows a room
     instead of the tropical image.

  CARTER
     There.

  DANIEL
     Hello.

  HAMMOND
     What is it?

  CARTER
     I'm not sure. Their technology appears to be
     advanced beyond ours.

  HAMMOND
     Then that previous image was fake.

  CARTER
     There's no other explanation, sir. The initial
     images portraying this planet as a paradise seemed
     to have been manufactured and then broadcast back
     to us through the MALP.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel are drinking the coffee and
     apparently enjoying it.

  HAMMOND
     Why?

  CARTER
     Possibly with the intended purpose of luring us
     into this room.

  O'NEILL
     See. I knew it was too good to be true.

  DANIEL
     Wow, this coffee's great.

  CARTER
     (mug in hand) I was just thinking that.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, is that cinnamon?

  DANIEL
     It's chicory.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c unscrews the lid from the coffee pot and
     drinks the contents.

  CARTER
     (concerned) Teal'c?

  O'NEILL
     Isn't that hot?

  TEAL'C
     Extremely.

  ANNOTATION
     The others all looked shocked.

  HAMMOND
     Just...stay on the base. We're going to need to
     keep an eye on you for the time being.

  DANIEL
     I feel fine.

  TEAL'C
     As do I, Daniel Jackson.

  HAMMOND
     For someone who just drank half a gallon of
     steaming hot coffee?

  O'NEILL
     Right.


LOCATION--COMMISSARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting at a table, leafing through a
     report. He starts eating a slice of pie with a
     fork and enjoys it so much he puts the papers down
     and picks up the pie.


LOCATION--MALP ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working on a MALP. She suddenly gets up
     and heads out of the room, the airman assigned to
     her following close behind.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is working at his desk. He looks up, then
     leaves the room.


LOCATION--COMMISSARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Carter and Teal'c enter the commissary,
     followed by the three Airmen assigned to them.
     O'Neill is sitting at a table surrounded by
     desserts.

  DANIEL
     Hungry.

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit down with O'Neill and start eating.

  O'NEILL
     Try the pie.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill) Sir, I'm running a full diagnostic on
     the...

  ANNOTATION
     She eats a piece of blue jelly and pauses.

  CARTER
     (cont'd) ...wow.

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah.

  DANIEL
     (with his mouth full) This is the best pie I've
     ever had.

  CARTER
     What's so different about it?

  O'NEILL
     Same old pie.

  TEAL'C
     It is most satisfying.

  CARTER
     Why does it taste so good?

  O'NEILL
     I dunno. All I do know is...I don't even like
     yoghurt.

  VOICE
     (over intercom) SG-1, report to Medlab 3.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 reluctantly put their desserts down and head
     out of the commissary, followed by the airmen.
     O'Neill stops at the doors.

  O'NEILL
     Wait. Sorry, sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes back to grab another slice of pie to take
     with him.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Dr Fraiser is showing SG-1 their brain scans on a
     monitor.

  FRASIER
     These scans have a certain percentage of error.
     Basically, it looks like an errant pixel.

  CARTER
     But it's in the exact same place on each of the
     scans.

  ANNOTATION
     A technician hands Fraiser a folder containing
     more X-rays.

  FRASIER
     (to the tech) Yeah, thank you. (to SG-1) So I had
     to run a comparative analysis on the computer to
     be sure. It's in the exact same spot in each of
     your brains but...we are talking about something
     smaller than the head of a pin.

  ANNOTATION
     She enlarges one of the scans.

  CARTER
     Barely large enough to show up on an X-ray.

  FRASIER.
     Right. Which is why I also needed to run an
     electron resonance scan...

  ANNOTATION
     She pauses as she takes out the new X-rays.

  FRASIER
     (shocked) This is, uh, magnified several thousand
     times. Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She places the X-rays against the light on the
     wall. They show a strange piece of technology
     wired into SG-1's brains.

  DANIEL
     That thing is in all of us?

  FRASIER
     I'm afraid so.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is now in the infirmary as Fraiser shows
     him the X-rays.

  HAMMOND
     Can these devices be removed?

  FRASIER
     Not without causing irreparable brain damage, sir.

  O'NEILL
     What's the down side?

  FRASIER
     How they were implanted without any external marks
     or injury to the cortex is beyond me.

  HAMMOND
     Can we determine what threat they pose?

  O'NEILL
     Apparently, all desserts on Base are in grave
     danger.

  FRASIER
     We've determined that there's a barely measurable
     electromagnetic field being emitted by the
     devices. But I'm not sure what that means.

  CARTER
     Well, so far all we've noticed are some cravings
     and a certain increased acuity in our senses.

  DANIEL
     Especially taste and smell.

  HAMMOND
     (to SG-1) Until we find out the true purpose of
     these objects, I am quarantining you in the level
     22 isolation quarters with a 24-hour guard.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, (NIGHT)

  ANNOTATION
     A guard is patrolling outside the complex.


LOCATION--QUARANTINE, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     An airman stands guard outside SG-1's room.
     Inside, O'Neill is playing on a hand-held game,
     Carter is working on a computer, while Teal'c and
     Daniel play chess.

  VOICE
     Boring!

  O'NEILL
     Who said that?

  DANIEL
     Wasn't me.

  VOICE
     What do you say we all go do something?

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, did you hear that?

  TEAL'C
     I did.

  O'NEILL
     Who's there?

  VOICE
     Ok. I'll make it so you can all see me, but only
     because you asked.

  ANNOTATION
     A man appears before them in a flash of light.

  MAN
     You all can see me, right?

  DANIEL
     (alarmed) Apparently.

  MAN
     Oh good, I'm so glad. Hello, hello, hello. Ha ha
     ha. Now you all say it.

  SG-1
     (in unison) Hello Urgo.

  URGO
     Ha. Do you know that you're all much better
     looking on the outside than you are on the inside?
     On the inside, it's so complicated. Oh please.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hesitantly walks around Urgo.

  O'NEILL
     (to the guard) Airman? Could you come here?

  ANNOTATION
     The airman enters the room and stands before
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     (cont'd) Do you see an intruder in this room?
     Anywhere?

  ANNOTATION
     The airman glances around, sees SG-1, but doesn't
     see Urgo.

  AIRMAN
     No, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo smiles from behind the airman.

  O'NEILL
     Right. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     The airman leaves and Urgo chuckles.

  O'NEILL
     Alright, what are you?

  URGO
     Urgo.

  DANIEL
     Which might explain why we all just said 'Hello
     Urgo'.

  URGO
     No. You are not dreaming.

  DANIEL
     (in dismay) You read our thoughts?

  URGO
     Don't panic. Just the thoughts you're having at
     the moment.

  CARTER
     Of course. You're actually in our heads, aren't
     you?

  URGO
     You are so smart, Samantha. I love that about you.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     The technology implanted in our brains, sir. We're
     looking at some sort of visual communication
     interface. A controlled hallucination.

  O'NEILL
     So...I...what?

  URGO
     He gets confused. By the way, who is Mary
     Steenburgen?

  CARTER
     This is incredible. The devices must be linked
     somehow. Dr Fraiser said they're emitting a small
     EM field, like...radio frequencies.

  DANIEL
     Are you saying the devices in our brains are some
     sort of wireless computer network?

  CARTER
     Yeah, an incredibly sophisticated one, obviously
     able to work over significant distances. I mean,
     that's why we were all drawn to the commissary
     when Colonel O'Neill was eating dessert.

  O'NEILL
     He can make us do stuff?

  URGO
     No never. In spite of what you're thinking, never.

  CARTER
     (to Urgo) But you can make suggestions, can't you?
     And enhance our sensory perception of experiences.

  DANIEL
     Like making things taste better.

  URGO
     Well, didn't it?

  CARTER
     Well, why not? He's tapped into our brains, he's
     making us all...see and hear him.

  URGO
     Boring. By the way, who decorated this room? It is
     so plain. Please don't tell me that your whole
     planet is like this. Not the whole planet. Hey,
     couldn't we go someplace else that's not
     here...someplace, you know...that's not here? Uh,
     kree. Anywhere. (whispering) Boring.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are sitting before Dr Fraiser.

  FRASIER
     Ok, so what does he look like?

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo stands next to her and strikes a pose.

  O'NEILL
     A famous tenor.

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo points to a piece of equipment.

  URGO
     What's this?

  FRASIER
     And you're seeing the exact same thing at the
     exact same time?

  CARTER
     Yep.

  URGO
     What is this?

  CARTER
     (to Urgo) It's a defibrillator.

  URGO
     Ah, interesting. Thank you. Is it defibrillating
     now?

  CARTER
     (to a confused Frasier) He, uh...it seems to crave
     new experiences. (to Urgo) You use the paddles to
     administer an electric shock to people whose
     hearts are beating irregularly.

  URGO
     Ah, and then they feel better? Does it feel good?
     Does it hurt? It hurts!

  DANIEL
     I would think so.

  URGO
     Let's try it.

  DANIEL
     No, I don't think so.

  URGO
     Why not? It's not going to kill you, is it? Or is
     it?

  FRASIER
     It talks to you?

  CARTER
     I think it experiences things through us, using
     our sensors to collect information.

  URGO
     (intently, to Teal'c) Try the paddles.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c gets up and walks over to the equipment.

  FRASIER
     So, do you experience any...physical
     sensations...?

  ANNOTATION
     She trails off as Teal'c switches the
     defibrillator on.

  FRASIER
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     She turns it off again.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

  URGO
     Will you loosen up?

  O'NEILL
     Hey, I'm loose.

  CARTER
     He doesn't have total control over us, just the
     power of suggestion.

  DANIEL
     He also seems to be able to enhance our enjoyment
     of certain experiences in order to motivate us.

  FRASIER
     Really.

  TEAL'C
     He appears unresponsive to direct questioning.

  URGO
     No, no that's not true. Oh, I'm picking your
     brains, you can pick my brains. I'll tell you
     anything you want to know. Ask me, ask me
     anything, what, what.

  TEAL'C
     Tell us how to remove you from our brains.

  URGO
     Oh, except that, ha ha. Duh.

  O'NEILL
     You said anything.

  URGO
     Wait a minute, why do you want to remove me from
     your brains? Don't you understand, I'm in your
     brains, I know you like me, what are you trying to
     prove, you can't fool me.

  O'NEILL
     No Urgo. We don't like you.

  URGO
     Admit it, tough guy. A smidgen?

  O'NEILL
     No smidgen.

  URGO
     I wouldn't blame you, I have a lot of endearing
     qualities.

  TEAL'C
     He will not cooperate O'Neill.

  URGO
     Years from now, when you're thinking about me,
     you're going to say 'How did I ever get along
     without that wonderful, constant companion?' Woof.

  O'NEILL
     Years from now?

  DANIEL
     Woof?

  URGO
     There is no way to remove me from your brains.
     Forget about it.

  O'NEILL
     What are you doing in our brains in the first
     place?

  URGO
     Well, ha ha ha, she got it. (he points to Carter)
     You got it. I'm here to learn. I'm here to
     experience your world.

  DANIEL
     So we've been tagged, like we do with animals in
     the wild when we want to study them.

  TEAL'C
     We are not wild animals.

  URGO
     Speak for yourself, big fella.

  CARTER
     Hang on a second. The race who created you, and
     put these things in our brains, they're going to
     want the information you're collecting at some
     point.

  URGO
     I suppose.

  CARTER
     So how do they get it?

  URGO
     You don't want to know.

  CARTER
     Let's say I do.

  URGO
     Don't worry, you will never have to find out.

  CARTER
     Aren't you programmed? I mean, how can you defy
     your creators?

  URGO
     Because they're evil, they're really scary evil
     and we don't want anything to do with them.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives her a meaningful look.

  DANIEL
     So maybe if we contact whoever created the
     technology.

  URGO
     That would be bad, very bad.

  O'NEILL
     Why should we listen to you?

  URGO
     Ok, I know that you only like me a little bit, but
     I like you a lot. And I do not want you to die.

  O'NEILL
     Die?

  URGO
     Yes, as in dead. They're going to kill you.
     They'll open your brains with a big, giant can
     opener and then they scoop me out with a big
     scoopy thing. That's how it works. It's death or
     me. Me or death. You've got to decide. Me or
     death.

  ANNOTATION
     No one answers.

  URGO
     Well?

  O'NEILL
     We're thinking.


LOCATION--DEBRIEFING ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are sitting at the table, with Hammond and
     Fraiser at one end and Urgo at the other. An
     airman stands guard behind him.

  URGO
     (singing) Me, me, me, me, me me me, me me, me, me,
     me me me. Me, me, me, me me me, me me, me, me, me,
     me, me, me, me... (Trails off, then picks up
     again) Me, me, me, me, me me me...

  O'NEILL
     (annoyed) Will you stop it?!

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo shuts up. The Airman thinks O'Neill is
     talking to him, while Hammond and Fraiser look on
     in shock.

  O'NEILL
     Please.

  HAMMOND
     So this technology is living vicariously through
     you?

  O'NEILL
     I say we risk it all and go back to the planet.

  CARTER
     Well what if he's telling the truth about his
     creators?

  O'NEILL
     There's no way to get him out of us here, right?

  URGO
     No, no way.

  FRASIER
     No.

  URGO
     See, she knows.

  CARTER
     Maybe there's another way. I haven't had much time
     to study the technology, but I could at least try
     to figure out a way to turn him off.

  URGO
     Turn me off?

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Please.

  URGO
     You're wasting your time, it's impossible. Hey, I
     got an idea, why don't we play hide and seek? You
     hide, and I'll...you know...I'm not going to
     cheat, you know, 'cause I have... (He covers his
     eyes) One, two, three, four...

  HAMMOND
     (to Carter) Whatever you need, Major. Dismissed.

  URGO
     Five, six...

  CARTER
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     They all leave the room.

  URGO
     Seven, eight, nine, ten...ha, ha.

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo uncovers his eyes and looks around for SG-1.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is walking down the corridor, followed by
     her guard, talking to empty space.

  CARTER
     (irritated) I don't have time to play, Urgo. I
     don't care if I'm 'it'. Because I have work to do.
     No, I am not hungry. Look, go eat pie with Colonel
     O'Neill. I am very busy right now.

  ANNOTATION
     She meets Hammond and Fraiser in the corridor.

  HAMMOND
     Major?

  CARTER
     I was just talking to Urgo, sir.

  HAMMOND
     I see.

  CARTER
     Oh, I wish you did.

  FRASIER
     (to empty space) Alright, look Urgo. Major Carter
     would like to...

  CARTER
     Uh, Janet. He's...right here.

  ANNOTATION
     She points to a different spot.

  FRASIER
     Well then, Urgo, Major Carter would very much like
     to be left alone.

  CARTER
     Janet, uh, as much as I appreciate it, please...
     (She looks shocked) Urgo, that is rude!

  FRASIER
     (annoyed) What did he say?

  CARTER
     Uh, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

  ANNOTATION
     She gestures for Urgo to go, then follows, still
     conversing with him.

  HAMMOND
     (to Frasier) Doctor, are we entirely sure the
     members of SG-1 are...what's the word?

  FRASIER
     Sane?

  HAMMOND
     That's the one.

  FRASIER
     Yes, sir. Remember, every thing we see or hear is
     processed in the brain. Urgo is creating an image
     of himself that they're responding to just like
     they would you or me.

  HAMMOND
     If you say so.

  ANNOTATION
     They carry on down the corridor.


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is drinking coffee while she works on a way
     to turn Urgo off.

  URGO
     Way off. Not even close. Not a chance. Forget
     about it.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel enter the laboratory.

  O'NEILL
     Carter.

  CARTER
     I believe I have a solution, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Please.

  CARTER
     The electromagnetic field these devices generate
     indicate they're still based on electronic
     principles.

  URGO
     So smart and yet...so wrong.

  CARTER
     (smiling) I don't think so. An EM pulse should do
     it.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to take a sip of her drink.

  URGO
     Ahhh!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter spills her hot coffee on her arm.

  CARTER
     Ah!

  URGO
     Oh.

  CARTER
     Urgo, that's hot!

  URGO
     (contritely) I didn't mean to.

  CARTER
     Yes, you did. Now stop it. (to O'Neill) Fact is,
     sir, Urgo's been trying to distract me like this
     since I first started thinking about it, so I'm
     probably on the right track.

  URGO
     I hope I didn't hurt you, I'm really sorry.

  CARTER
     I'll live.

  URGO
     (to O'Neill) She forgives me.

  CARTER
     A strong enough EM pulse can knock out most
     electronic-based technologies. It would be
     harmless to us, but it should render Urgo
     impotent.

  URGO
     Could you, ah, rephrase that?

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Do it.

  URGO
     Oh, please. Oh, please don't do this. Hey, listen,
     I didn't mean to scald you. I like you, I really,
     really do. Please, it was an accident.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves around, switching on equipment.

  CARTER
     This room is shielded so it won't affect any of
     the Base's technology.

  URGO
     Don't do this please. What can I do to make you
     like me?

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) You sure this won't hurt us?

  URGO
     No, it's going to hurt me.

  CARTER
     We won't even feel it.

  URGO
     But I will. I throw myself at your mercy. Please,
     have mercy. Ooh, I know, I can be smaller...

  ANNOTATION
     He disappears in a flash of light and reappears as
     a tiny figure on the table.

  URGO
     How's this?

  CARTER
     (to the others) Ready?

  URGO
     I'm here, look how teeny-weeny I am. How can
     anything this teeny-weeny hurt anybody?

  ANNOTATION
     He suddenly reappears, full-sized, behind O'Neill.

  URGO
     Wait! I can be dull. Want me to be dull? (In a
     toneless voice) What a nice shade of gray. How
     about some white bread with mayonnaise? Want to
     watch golf on television?

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Will you flip that switch?

  URGO
     No. Oh, how about this?

  ANNOTATION
     He then reappears smartly dressed as an Airman.

  URGO
     Can you resist this?

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are unimpressed. Urgo changes back.

  URGO
     Don't do that, oh sacre bleu. (He starts to fade)
     I'm melting, I'm melting. What a world, what a
     world...

  CARTER
     The pulse hasn't gone off yet Urgo. It's on a
     timer.

  URGO
     Oh. How much time do I...?

  ANNOTATION
     There is an electrical surge and Urgo disappears.
     Carter checks her equipment while O'Neill waves
     his hand through the air where Urgo was standing.

  DANIEL
     That's it?

  CARTER
     Yep.

  TEAL'C
     I feel no differently.

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) Listen.

  ANNOTATION
     There's no sound.

  CARTER
     What?

  O'NEILL
     Exactly.

  DANIEL
     Way to go, Sam.

  CARTER
     We'll see.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is checking SG-1's results once more.

  FRASIER
     (to Hammond) The devices are still present, but
     the EM field that was being emitted by them is
     gone. Everything else checks out to me.

  O'NEILL
     Request permission for SG-1 to go back to work,
     sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks doubtful.

  HAMMOND
     Give it a week.

  O'NEILL
     A week?

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 all appear disappointed.


LOCATION--FRAISER'S OFFICE, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is at her desk, talking with Carter. The
     monitors on the wall show the rooms occupied by
     the rest of SG-1.

  FRASIER
     Well, everything looks normal. How are you
     feeling?

  CARTER
     Great. I just want to get back to work.

  FRASIER
     Well assuming you are clear by next weekend,
     Cassandra and I are going to the lake and we are
     going to rent a rowboat. Would you like to come
     along?

  CARTER
     Yeah, I'd love to.

  FRASIER
     Great. Can you send Daniel up next?

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up and heads out of the office.

  CARTER
     (singing) Row, row, row your boat gently down the
     stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life
     is but a dream.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks up in surprise. On the monitors, the
     rest of SG-1 are also singing 'Row, row, row your
     boat.'


LOCATION--DEBRIEFING ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are sitting at the table with Hammond and
     Fraiser.

  O'NEILL
     I was not singing. I'd know if I was singing. I
     don't even know the words to 'Row, row, row...'

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser shows him the recording she made.

  O'NEILL
     (on video, singing) ...life is but a dream. And
     row, row, row your boat gently down the stream...

  ANNOTATION
     She turns it off.

  O'NEILL
     Ok. If you call that singing.

  ANNOTATION
     He closes his eyes as he realises what's going on.

  O'NEILL
     Urgo.

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo appears opposite him in a flash of light.

  URGO
     (laughing) I couldn't help myself.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill bangs his head on the table.

  CARTER
     I was so sure it would work.

  URGO
     Oh, it did, don't feel bad. It did work for a
     while. Everything went away, it was very sad.
     Very, very sad, and then all of a sudden I was
     back in your brains where I belong.

  CARTER
     The system must have some sort of reset. I'm
     sorry.

  HAMMOND
     I'm sorry too. Because as long as that device is
     capable of influencing you in any way, you're
     relieved of active duty.

  O'NEILL
     (face down on the table) Oh, General, is that
     really necessary?

  HAMMOND
     I believe it is. Whether you admit it or not,
     you've been compromised. The fact is, an alien
     entity has control over you, however limited. We
     don't know what it's capable of.

  CARTER
     Well, he can't actually make us do anything we
     don't want to, sir.

  FRASIER
     Then why did I have to treat your arm for a burn?
     Didn't you say Urgo was responsible?

  URGO
     I didn't mean to!

  O'NEILL/CARTER/DANIEL
     (in unison) He didn't mean to.

  TEAL'C
     It was not his intention.

  ANNOTATION
     The others all look at Teal'c.

  HAMMOND
     I trust I have made my point.

  O'NEILL
     Come on Urgo, be a mensch. How do we get rid of
     you?

  URGO
     I have no idea. I really...I just don't know.

  CARTER
     He really may not know, sir.

  O'NEILL
     How could he not know?

  CARTER
     He's just the program.

  O'NEILL
     Program?

  CARTER
     I'm just saying that your software doesn't know
     how your computer works.

  O'NEILL
     Hey! My software doesn't make me sing 'Row, row,
     row your boat.'

  URGO
     Please. Please don't fight, I'm here, what's the
     difference how? Look, I'm not going to make
     another noise, not a peep, nothing. I'm going to
     be quiet like a little tiny mouse, not a peep.
     Watch. (laughing) I got an idea. Why don't we play
     a game? Some sort of a wonderful game? Uh,
     something with a dictionary. It's so much fun. You
     know, you get a word and then, ha, you write what
     you think the word is. Oh, it's a lot of laughs.
     (points to O'Neill) And educational. It's really
     nice. I think you'll like it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts his head back down on the table.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     A MALP is in the Gate room, ready to be deployed.
     Armed soldiers stand behind it.

  TECHNICIAN
     Chevron seven coded and locked.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate opens and the MALP moves forward.
     Urgo points to the MALP on the screen Carter is
     monitoring the Gate room from.

  URGO
     Oh, what's that?

  CARTER
     Actually, it's our version of you.

  URGO
     But not as suave and sophisticated, n'est pas?

  CARTER
     It's equipped with sensors, video camera,
     microphone...we use it to explore in much the same
     way that you do, except that...

  O'NEILL
     (warningly) Carter.

  CARTER
     Sir. I don't know why I was telling him that.

  O'NEILL
     Hello.

  ANNOTATION
     The screen shows the tropical planet.

  URGO
     Oh, how beautiful. Can we go there?

  CARTER
     It's an illusion. Your creators do this in order
     to lure people into their trap.

  URGO
     See I told you they were mean, that's mean.

  TECHNICIAN
     The MALP is online, General.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond speaks into a microphone, his voice
     transmitted through the MALP on the other side of
     the Stargate.

  HAMMOND
     This is General Hammond of the planet Earth. We
     know the images being transmitted to us are false.
     We request a dialogue. Please respond.

  URGO
     (whispering) Why is he doing that?

  DANIEL
     We're trying to communicate with your creators.

  URGO
     No, bad, no.

  DANIEL
     It's our last alternative before we resort to
     actually going back there.

  URGO
     (to O'Neill) You know, you were just thinking of
     that island Maui. With the big beaches and the
     little bikinis. That's where we should go 'cause
     it's very nice and warm there...instead of being
     here.

  VOICE
     Who dares challenge Togar?

  URGO
     (covering his face) That voice. (whispering) It's
     him.

  HAMMOND
     Dr Jackson?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel goes over to the microphone.

  DANIEL
     This is Dr Daniel Jackson. We don't mean to
     challenge you. We've discovered the devices you
     implanted in our brains and we'd like you to
     remove them...him.

  TOGAR
     Him?

  DANIEL
     Urgo.

  TOGAR
     How do you know this name?

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo shakes his head.

  DANIEL
     He told us. He interacts with us.

  O'NEILL
     (yelling into the microphone) He's driving us
     crazy!

  TOGAR
     That is an error. Return the subjects. Urgo will
     be removed.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate shuts down, ending the transmission.

  O'NEILL
     You heard the man.

  CARTER
     Sir, we could be risking our lives.

  O'NEILL
     Ok. Let's ask the question. Do we want to give up
     SG-1 and walk around the rest of our lives
     with...him yapping away in our heads?

  URGO
     (whispering) Yes. Say yes.

  O'NEILL
     Or...do we take the risk and try and find a way to
     get rid of him so we can get on with our lives?

  URGO
     (whispering) No. Say no.

  DANIEL
     Sorry, Urgo.

  O'NEILL
     That's good enough. Teal'c?

  TEAL'C
     If we are to remain in the service of this
     world...Urgo must be removed.

  URGO
     (to Carter) Sam. Sammie. You like me. I remind you
     of your Uncle Irving. (He makes a popping noise)
     Remember?

  CARTER
     (smiling) Yeah, I guess you do a little.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     Sorry. I guess I say we go.

  HAMMOND
     Then it's settled.

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo buries his face in his hands.


LOCATION--LOCKER ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are preparing to go offworld.

  DANIEL
     What do you suppose Togar really meant by an
     'error'?

  CARTER
     I suppose he meant Urgo wasn't supposed to be
     interacting with us.

  URGO
     Oh please, please don't go, he's going to kill
     you. He really will, he's nasty. It'll be a
     painful and awful death. Honest. Ok, ok, fine.
     He's going to kill me. You heard him. Oh you
     people, for crying out loud. Don't you have any
     feelings?

  CARTER
     Do you?

  O'NEILL
     Carter? Why do you humour him? He's obviously
     programmed for self-preservation.

  CARTER
     Sir, that voice, Togar, said that this was an
     error. We're probably not even supposed to know
     he's here. (to Urgo) You aren't supposed to be
     interacting with us, are you?

  URGO
     Well, um, actually when I first, er...and we got
     to be...Technically? No.

  CARTER
     Can you describe how you're feeling right now?

  URGO
     Me? Nervous, agitated...a little hungry.

  DANIEL
     Afraid?

  URGO
     Oh, sure, ok.

  CARTER
     Of what?

  URGO
     Oh, going away like last time, not experiencing,
     not being here with you.

  CARTER
     Of death?

  URGO
     Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh sure. Big time. He's going to
     kill me and that's why that death thing keeps
     popping up.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill) Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  DANIEL
     Wait a minute JACK.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel?

  DANIEL
     By definition, what constitutes a sentient life
     form?

  CARTER
     Self-awareness, consciousness.

  URGO
     I'm me. No doubt about that. What else?

  CARTER
     Uh, the ability to think independently.

  URGO
     I'm independent. I just, you know, like company.

  DANIEL
     Fear of death.

  URGO
     I got that too.

  O'NEILL
     You're not going to convince me it's alive. Look.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his arms through Urgo and waves them
     around.

  URGO
     Hey, hey hey.

  O'NEILL
     He's not really here. He's here. (He taps his
     head) In our heads.

  DANIEL
     There are plenty of life forms that require other
     life forms to live.

  TEAL'C
     (to Urgo) Then you are parasite, like the Goa'uld.

  URGO
     (mimicking TEAL'C) Parasite, like the Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     Or, a Tok'ra. I mean, just by being parasitical by
     nature doesn't make you inherently bad.

  O'NEILL
     It's a machine!

  URGO
     That hurts.

  CARTER
     Sir, he's artificial intelligence, but...just
     because someone made him doesn't mean he
     isn't...alive.

  URGO
     Listen to her.

  O'NEILL
     So what are you saying?

  CARTER
     I'm just saying we should consider it. I mean,
     maybe this error wasn't really an error at all,
     but rather some higher technological
     evolution...the birth of a whole new life form.

  DANIEL
     I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I
     agree with Sam.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  CARTER
     Well, sir, it's just...

  O'NEILL
     No! Hammond said it, we've been compromised. Now
     we explain the situation to this...Toga guy, and
     we let him deal with Hugo once he's out of our
     heads.

  DANIEL
     Urgo.

  O'NEILL
     Urgo.

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs his jacket.

  O'NEILL
     Let's go.

  URGO
     Oh. I'm doomed.

  VFX--SHOOTING THROUGH WORMHOLE



LOCATION--PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 step out of the Stargate and are instantly
     transported to a laboratory-like room, stripped of
     their weapons and equipment.

  O'NEILL
     I hate it when that happens.

  URGO
     Ooh, this is bad, this is very bad. Very bad.

  ANNOTATION
     A door rolls open and a man stands before them.

  MAN
     Do not move or I will render you unconscious, if
     necessary.

  DANIEL
     You're Togar?

  ANNOTATION
     Togar steps into the room. He looks exactly like
     Urgo.

  TOGAR
     Yes, Togar.

  URGO
     (whispering) As handsome as he is evil.

  ANNOTATION
     Togar is carrying some type of weapon in his hand.

  TEAL'C
     There is no reason to fear us.

  TOGAR
     I fear not.

  ANNOTATION
     The door rolls closed behind him.

  URGO
     Oh, he's a madman, he's an evil, terrible madman.
     Run for your lives.

  TOGAR
     (to Urgo) I hear you. Be silent!

  O'NEILL
     Wait. You hear him?

  TOGAR
     Yes. (He points to a glowing device on his ear)
     Hear and see.

  DANIEL
     Then you should be able to see that he's afraid.

  TOGAR
     Relocate.

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures with the weapon and they stand aside.

  URGO
     While I'm being silent, Togar, I'd like to point
     out that when I called you a madman, I meant it in
     the nicest possible way.

  TOGAR
     Come. (He beckons) Come forward. Come forth.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 stand before him.

  TOGAR
     Stay.

  ANNOTATION
     He passes his hand over a clear container and a
     strange creature with eyestalks appears inside. A
     beam of blue lights hits the creature and passes
     into a dish.

  TOGAR
     Urgo...is this.

  ANNOTATION
     A tiny device appears in the dish.

  TOGAR
     (cont'd) The specimen is unharmed. (He waves his
     hand and the creature disappears) As you will be.

  DANIEL
     What about Urgo?

  TOGAR
     It will be destroyed.

  URGO
     See. Oh, what did I tell you? Oh please, don't let
     him do this to me. Teal'c, help me. Kree! Jump
     him, give him a double jaffa, go on.

  CARTER
     (to Togar) The technology you invented is very
     advanced.

  TOGAR
     Yes.

  URGO
     It's because they're all too scared to go out and
     experience things for themselves.

  TOGAR
     Enough!

  DANIEL
     Look, we're very grateful that you're willing to
     take Urgo out of our minds.

  CARTER
     The point is, we think Urgo may actually be alive.

  TOGAR
     He is an error.

  CARTER
     Maybe he is. But another word for it might be
     miracle.

  TOGAR
     That is ridiculous.

  CARTER
     Well, what you call an error has somehow resulted
     in life. I mean, he's self-aware, he's acting and
     thinking independently, he's afraid of his own
     death. By any definition, he's acting...alive.

  O'NEILL
     All we're saying is that maybe there's a way of
     doing this without...killing him.

  TOGAR
     There is not.

  O'NEILL
     Ok, had to ask.

  CARTER
     (to Togar) I don't understand. Why not?

  TOGAR
     The unit must be in a life form. It cannot exist
     on its own.

  CARTER
     Well there has to be some way, you created it.

  DANIEL
     You'd be killing something you gave life.

  URGO
     (to Togar) Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     Urgo and Togar stare at each other.

  URGO
     This is a terrible idea. I'd rather die a painful
     and horrible death.

  DANIEL
     It's just a thought.

  URGO
     I want to live. I want to experience the universe
     and I want to eat pie.

  O'NEILL
     Who doesn't?

  TOGAR
     Enough babbling. Explain.

  DANIEL
     I was just thinking that maybe you'd want to put
     Urgo in you.

  URGO
     No! No, I wouldn't do that. I'd rather be in that
     little...with the eyes and...no!

  TOGAR
     The purpose of the technology is to observe and
     explore.

  CARTER
     But the technology is different now.

  DANIEL
     Look, we don't know you very well, but I get the
     distinct feeling that Urgo is everything you're
     not.

  URGO
     You can say that again.

  DANIEL
     But I think that he's everything you wish you
     were. Outgoing, adventuresome...

  O'NEILL
     Annoying.

  DANIEL
     Look, it would be a chance to change, to maybe
     experience some of the things that you're afraid
     to do yourself.

  TOGAR
     No, not afraid.

  TEAL'C
     Why do you not explore worlds through the Stargate
     yourself?

  ANNOTATION
     Togar appears to consider this.

  TOGAR
     (slowly) It could help me learn how the error
     occurred.

  CARTER
     Then you'll do it.

  TOGAR
     I could try.

  URGO
     Count me out. I don't want to do it. He's mean and
     boring and...and...and...mean.

  O'NEILL
     We're giving you a chance here. Him or death.

  URGO
     No, I...

  O'NEILL
     Death or him.

  URGO
     Oh dear.

  O'NEILL
     Well?

  URGO
     I'm thinking.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at Togar while SG-1 wait.

  URGO
     He's so...so, um...

  O'NEILL
     Mean?

  URGO
     Yeah.

  O'NEILL
     Boring? So change him.

  URGO
     Me change him? Ha, ha ha. Ok, I'll do it.

  O'NEILL
     (to Togar) Urgo thinks it's a great idea and I'm
     sure you'll enjoy his presence as much as we have.

  URGO
     See, I knew it. I knew you liked me. Ha, I was
     right.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe...a little.

  URGO
     How about a hug?

  O'NEILL
     Don't push it.

     Urgo is here.

  URGO
     I'm here. I'm here!

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 can no longer see or hear him.

  O'NEILL
     Well, Togar. Thanks for your hospitality. We
     appreciate it.

  TOGAR
     I will return you to your planet now.

  DANIEL
     Wait, Togar. How do we know that Urgo's really
     alive?

  URGO
     I'm here, I'm here! Tell 'em, tell 'em!

  TOGAR
     (annoyed) I will as soon as you are quiet!

  O'NEILL AND DANIEL
     (in unison) He's alive.

  TOGAR
     Urgo says goodbye and I say...thank you.

  DANIEL
     Bye Urgo.

  ANNOTATION
     Even though he can't see, Urgo waves goodbye.

  CARTER
     (to Togar) I was thinking now that we've got to
     know each other and helped each other out, maybe
     we could share some information about our
     respective...

  ANNOTATION
     Togar blinks and SG-1 vanishes in a flash of
     light.

  URGO
     Oh, I'm going to miss 'em. Hey, I know why don't
     we...?

  TOGAR
     No!

  URGO
     Why not?

  TOGAR
     No!

  URGO
     It's really fun and exciting.

  TOGAR
     No.

  URGO
     Are you sure we're thinking of the same thing?

  TOGAR
     Positive.

  URGO
     Oh, but you don't know what you're missing.

  O'NEILL
     (confused) Uh...

  CARTER
     General, didn't we just...?

  HAMMOND
     You've been gone over ten hours, Major.

     Oh boy.

  HAMMOND
