LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting on bed getting the burn on his
     arm tended by a nurse.

  DANIEL
     "Beware The Destroyers". That's what the message
     said. These are the coordinates the Goa'uld will
     launch their attack from. It was a warning.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel shows the piece of paper still gripped in
     his hand.

  TEAL'C
     Or so your vision foretells.

  DANIEL
     No! It wasn't a vision or a dream or a
     hallucination. It was (Daniel winces as the nurse
     rips bandage) real. Now, I know this is hard for
     you guys to believe. But I swear to you, the
     entire time you thought I had disappeared on
     P3R-233, I was experiencing an alternate reality.

  O'NEILL
     And you were there, (nods to Teal'c) and you were
     there, (nods to Carter) and there's no place like
     home.

  DANIEL
     As a matter of fact you were there.

  CARTER
     Daniel. It's not that we don't believe you...

  DANIEL
     So you do?

  O'NEILL
     No. It's just that...we don't believe you.

  DANIEL
     Jack, this is very important.

  CARTER
     All right. Daniel, when you were in this alternate
     reality, were there differences?

  DANIEL
     Yes. Uh, Teal'c was leading the attack on Earth. I
     wasn't even part of the program. You and Jack were
     engaged to be married...

  O'NEILL
     Excuse me?

  CARTER
     What? (she exchanges surprised looks with O'Neill)
     Okay, uh, even if you did actually experience the
     alternate reality, doesn't the very fact that
     there were differences mean that we won't face the
     same fate?

  DANIEL
     Yes. But the defining event, the death of Ra, took
     place in both worlds.

  TEAL'C
     An attack of retribution.

  DANIEL
     Yes! And the same thing is going to happen here
     unless we stop it.

  O'NEILL
     All right. Wait a minute. Let...Let me get
     something straight here. Engaged?

  CARTER
     It is theoretically possible.

  O'NEILL
     It's against regulations!

  CATER
     I'm talking physics, sir. Though the whole concept
     of alternate realities, entire alternate
     universes, was predicted by Einstein a long time
     ago...

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond enters the infirmary with Samuels behind
     him.

  HAMMOND
     I thought you might all be here. How's our boy?

  CARTER
     He's gonna to be just fine, General. (She greets
     the officer with Hammond) Major Samuels.

  SAMUELS
     That's, er, Lieutenant Colonel Samuels now,
     Captain.

  CARTER
     I beg your pardon, sir. Congratulations.

  SAMUELS
     Thank you.

  O'NEILL
     You'll always be "Sparky" to me.

  CARTER
     I thought you'd been transferred to the Pentagon,
     sir.

  SAMUELS
     I was. Stargate Mission Analysis. I'm here today,
     of course, for the hearing.

  O'NEILL
     Hearing?

  SAMUELS
     Senator Kinsey? The Stargate Program? Uh, I
     thought you were going to testify.

  HAMMOND
     They will. SG-1 just retuned from a mission last
     night. I haven't had a chance to inform them.

  SAMUELS
     Well, perhaps I shouldn't say too much more.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, cut the crap, Samuels. What's going on?

  SAMUELS
     Senator Kinsey has taken a great deal of interest
     in the program. And thus far he hasn't liked what
     he's seen.

  O'NEILL
     (dryly) I'm sorry to hear that.

  SAMUELS
     As you should be, Colonel. It could mean the end
     of the Stargate. The hearing is at 1400 hours. I
     look forward to seeing you all there.

  ANNOTATION
     Samuels exits.

LOCATION--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is on the red phone. O'Neill stands
     nearby.

  HAMMOND
     Yes, sir, I understand. We'll fight the good
     fight.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond hangs up phone.

  O'NEILL
     General, politics isn't my strong suit, but
     doesn't President outrank senator?

  HAMMOND
     Senator Kinsey is Chairman of the Appropriations
     Committee. He's demanded to know what is behind
     the line item the Pentagon refers to as Area 52.

  O'NEILL
     That would be the Stargate.

  HAMMOND
     An unofficial project...that just happens to cost
     7.4 billion dollars a year to operate. The
     President and the Joint Chiefs thought if they
     granted the Senator the appropriate clearances,
     let him in on the existence of the SGC, he'd
     recognise its importance to national security and
     authorise the expenditure.

  O'NEILL
     I take it he didn't.

  HAMMOND
     The idea backfired. After reading your mission
     reports and being fully briefed by Colonel
     Samuels, the Senator decided the SGC would receive
     no further funding from the Treasury.

  O'NEILL
     That effectively shuts us down, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Very effectively. It costs nearly a billion
     dollars just to turn the lights on around here.

  O'NEILL
     How 'bout a bake sale? Yard sale? Garage?

  HAMMOND
     This is what I look like when I'm not laughing,
     Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Car wash?

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond suppresses a laugh.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry, sir. It's just I--I don't get it. How
     does one man get that much power?

  HAMMOND
     The Constitution of these United States. The issue
     of our worth could be debated openly in the
     Senate, but not without making the Stargate known
     to the general public. The President doesn't
     believe the time for that has come. I agree with
     him.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  O'NEILL
     Well, he's late.

  TEAL'C
     You seem more apprehensive of this hearing than
     you are of battle.

  O'NEILL
     I prefer battle, actually.

  DANIEL
     I'm sure once we tell him that Earth's future is
     at stake...

  O'NEILL
     Daniel. Let's just keep the alternative reality
     story as our little ace in the hole, shall we?

  DANIEL
     Why?

  ANNOTATION
     Lieutenant Colonel Samuels, military aides and
     Senator Kinsey walk down the spiral staircase into
     the briefing room.

  O'NEILL
     Just because.

  ANNOTATION
     He taps Daniel on the shoulder.

  KINSEY
     Ladies and Gentlemen, I apologise. A certain
     congressman, who will go nameless, just does not
     know how to take "no" for an answer. Ah, this is
     the infamous SG-1.

  O'NEILL
     Infamous? Yes, sir. Colonel Jack O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps forward and shakes hands with Kinsey.

  KINSEY
     Colonel. I've heard a lot about you.

  O'NEILL
     Don't believe a word of it, Senator. I'm actually
     a nice guy.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey walks past. O'Neill rolls his eyes
     unobserved.

  KINSEY
     And this must be the drain through which the money
     flows.

  HAMMOND
     I know you have a very busy schedule, Senator.

  KINSEY
     Yes. Of course, General Hammond. Please be seated.
     Let me see. Colonel O'Neill. Captain Carter.
     Doctor Jackson. Teal'c. With an apostrophe, I
     understand. Let me first say that though illness
     robbed me of the chance ever to serve in this
     country's military, I have the greatest respect
     for those who do. Especially those who have made
     service of country their life's work. As I have in
     my own way. There is no more honourable vocation.

  HAMMOND
     Thank you, Senator. I couldn't agree more.

  KINSEY
     Having said that, I want to make one thing
     abundantly clear. I am by nature suspicious of all
     things secretive. Be they in the government or
     inside the military service. I believe that which
     grows in shadow, but withers in the light of
     day...does not belong on the vine. I've read
     several reports of your excursions. Colonel
     Samuels has been kind enough to brief me on the
     Stargate, and I have tried to maintain an open
     mind. I must admit that I find the very idea of
     this facility, of this command, offensive. It is
     far too dangerous to be this secretive. I have
     found several examples where you have averted
     tragedy on a global scale by the skin of your
     teeth, and virtually none where you have brought
     back anything of worth. However since I have, on
     occasion, been wrong before. The President of the
     United States has asked me to hear you out. So
     here I am.

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) Well. So long as you've got an
     open mind.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     For crying out loud, Samuels, what did you tell
     this man?

  SAMUELS
     The truth.

  KINSEY
     Colonel Samuels was entirely nonpartisan.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, now that's impossible. He's been against
     this program from day one.

  SAMUELS
     If anything, I voiced my awe and amazement at what
     the Stargate is: a technological marvel.

  CARTER
     It is so much more than that, Senator. The
     Stargate represents a giant step in our
     understanding of the universe. We have learned
     more about astrophysics in these few months than
     in the last fifty years.

  DANIEL
     It also gives us insights into human cultures that
     are thousands of years old.

  KINSEY
     Doctor Jackson, I'm sure as a scholar of ancient
     mythology you're familiar with the story of
     Pandora.

  DANIEL
     From Greek mythology, of course. The first woman
     ever created by Zeus, who according to legend,
     gave her a box and warned her never to open it.

  KINSEY
     But she did. Out of curiosity. Despite the warning
     of her god, who was also her father, she did. And
     from it sprung all the plagues, pestilence and
     evil that exists now in this world.

  DANIEL
     And keeping in mind that we are talking about a
     myth, she closed it in time to keep hope inside.

  KINSEY
     Then should we not close your 'gate for the same
     reason, to keep hope inside?

  O'NEILL
     Senator if...if I may jump in here. I'm not as
     slick as you guys talking in metaphors here. I'm a
     military man. I prefer facts. And the fact is the
     'gate, i.e., the box, is already open. Now what's
     done is done. We made ourselves an enemy by
     killing Ra. But the threat the Goa'ulds now
     represent...

  KINSEY
     Threat?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir. As in "threatening".

  KINSEY
     The word "threat", Colonel O'Neill, has been used
     far too often by this country's military as a
     justification for expenditures that we can no
     longer afford. Do you know how much this program
     costs?

  O'NEILL
     Seven-ish.

  KINSEY
     7 billion, 407 million dollars.

  O'NEILL
     Give or take.

  KINSEY
     Per year.

  O'NEILL
     With all due respect, Senator, the Accounting
     Department is up on Level 3, I believe. But if you
     want to talk about maintaining the first line of
     defence against, what I believe is the greatest
     enemy humanity has ever faced...

  KINSEY
     Hyperbole.

  O'NEILL
     See for yourself! General, I suggest we dial up
     'ol P4A-771, I believe it was. See how long the
     good Senator lasts in that world.

  KINSEY
     I have spent a career listening to doomsayers in
     uniform. Let us build our billion dollar machine
     and we will save America from the barbarians at
     the gate. Let me remind you that the Cold War is
     over.

  O'NEILL
     And let me tell you something. This time there
     really are barbarians. They're called Goa'ulds,
     and they really are at the gate. That one!

  KINSEY
     Then I suggest we close it.

  DANIEL
     Senator, we have reason to believe that the
     Goa'uld are about to launch an attack, in force,
     in ships.

  KINSEY
     Then I think they'll regret taking on the United
     States military.

  O'NEILL
     Oh for God's sake!

  DANIEL
     Oh, you're right. We'll--We'll-we'll just upload a
     computer virus into the mothership.

  CARTER
     If they come in ships, Senator, we won't be any
     match for them. At their level of technology they
     can wipe us out from orbit.

  KINSEY
     I'm not convinced of that.

  TEAL'C
     They speak the truth.

  KINSEY
     I'm not entirely convinced of that either.

  O'NEILL
     (stands up) General, what the hell are we doing
     here? This man has made up his mind already.

  KINSEY
     (also stands up) Sit down, Colonel. When I've made
     up my mind, you will know it. I will ask you once
     more. Sit down. Please.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sits, and Kinsey also sits.

  KINSEY
     I gave the President my word that I would give you
     a fair hearing, and I intend to do that. He held
     you and your team up as a shining example of the
     fine work the SGC is doing. Now, do you stand by
     SG-1's record?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, I do.

  KINSEY
     Then let's just go through it, shall we?


LOCATION--A TRUCK ENTERS CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, NIGHT


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Confidential folders are handed out among Kinsey's
     team.

  KINSEY
     Thank you. (opens and reads from the first file)
     On February 10 of this year, you along with a team
     lead by Major Charles Kawalsky went through the
     Stargate on a reconnaissance mission--

  O'NEILL
     Excuse me, Senator. Samuels, could I get a copy of
     that?

  KINSEY
     You wrote this report, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Just want a little reference.

  KINSEY
     Samuels. (Samuels looks at aide next to him, who
     passes her report to O'Neill.) To repeat. On the
     tenth of February of this year, you along with a
     team lead by Major Charles Kawalsky, went through
     the Stargate on a reconnaissance mission to rescue
     both Doctor Jackson's wife and her brother, and to
     determine the Goauld [pronounced GoAld] threat.

  O'NEILL
     Excuse me, Senator. I'm sorry. There should be an
     apostrophe after the "A", before the "U". It's
     pronounced...

  ANNOTATION
     He looks to Carter.

  CARTER
     (pronouncing correctly) Goa'uld.

  KINSEY
     I assume, since shortly after arriving you were
     captured and imprisoned, that you would
     characterise this world as an enemy stronghold.

  O'NEILL
     I would.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey nods to Samuels.

  SAMUELS
     I read from the personal report of Colonel Jack
     O'Neill dated the 23rd February. "Skaara was
     chosen. I tried to stop them from taking him away,
     but was struck by an alien staff weapon. In that
     moment, Apophis gave the order."


LOCATION--DUNGEON OF APOPHIS' CASTLE ON CHULAK

  APOPHIS
     Kill the rest!

  ANNOTATION
     Crowd screams and surges away from the serpent
     guards who walk down the stairs towards them.
     O'Neill, Daniel and Carter get off the ground.
     Amaunet and Apophis turn away and enter the sedan
     chair. Guards continue to advance down stairs,
     towards the panicking crowd. The sedan chair
     leaves, followed by some guards. The iron gate
     closes behind them, locking the prisoners in with
     the serpent guards. Teal'c, in serpent guard
     uniform, advances through the crowd. Serpent
     guards prime their weapons.

  O'NEILL
     I can save these people!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c whirls to face him, primes his staff
     weapon.

  O'NEILL
     Help me! Help me.

  TEAL'C
     Many have said that. (whirls and shoots the first
     serpent guard) But you are the first I believe
     could do it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c throws his staff weapon to O'Neill. Carter
     pulls Daniel out of the line of fire. Teal'c grabs
     the fallen guard's staff weapon. A firefight
     ensues, as the crowd cower against the back wall.
     Some prisoners are shot. O'Neill and Teal'c kill
     all the serpent guards and then race up the stairs
     to scare the other people outside the gate away.
     O'Neill turns at the top of the stairs.

  O'NEILL
     Get out of the way!

  ANNOTATION
     People move away from the back wall. O'Neill blows
     a hole in the wall, and then runs over to the it,
     joined by Carter. Daniel gets to feet. O'Neill
     checks outside the prison wall, to ensure it is
     safe.

  O'NEILL
     Come on! Let's move!

  CARTER
     All right. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter runs out the hole in the wall. People start
     running out after her.

  O'NEILL
     Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks down the stairs of the prison,
     unbuckling his breast plate, surveying the damage.
     He drops the breastplate. Dead Jaffa are on the
     floor.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  KINSEY
     So, even with your team unarmed, at the enemy's
     mercy, in the palm of their hand as it were, one
     of their own was able to set you free.

  CARTER
     It-it wasn't that simple, Senator.

  KINSEY
     (to Samuels) Read on please.

  SAMUELS
     "We met heavy resistance on our return to the
     Stargate, and became pinned down by enemy
     aircraft."


LOCATION--CHULAK

  ANNOTATION
     The prisoners led by O'Neill, Daniel, Carter and
     Teal'c run through the forest. A death glider
     sweeps down towards them. The glider primes its
     guns.

  O'NEILL
     Take cover!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel helps people out of the way. People are
     running everywhere for cover. Explosions hit the
     ground as the first shots from death glider hit
     nearby. Fighter comes in to attack. More
     explosions. O'Neill and Teal'c fire staff weapons
     at the death glider. They hit the glider to no
     effect. The fighter continues to strafe the ground
     around them, one sweep past after another. O'Neill
     and Teal'c continue to fire at it. People are hit
     by the shots.

  CARTER
     Colonel! We're sitting ducks here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c continue to fire at the death
     glider. A member of SG-2 fires a ground to air
     missile at the glider and hits it directly. It
     hits the ground and explodes.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey gets up and starts to walk around the
     table.

  KINSEY
     It seems to me that Major Kawalsky made light work
     of what you refer to in your report as a "death
     glider".

  O'NEILL
     They were taken by surprise. I wouldn't expect it
     to be as easy next time.

  KINSEY
     Why not?

  DANIEL
     Well for one thing, they weren't use to fighting
     humans with our level of technology. Now they know
     what we have.

  CARTER
     I don't think you understand how much more
     powerful their weapons are.

  KINSEY
     Yet you managed to get away with minimal
     casualties. Hardly the greatest threat humanity
     has ever faced.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey walks by the briefing room window. The Gate
     activates.

  KINSEY
     (alarmed) What's happening?

  HAMMOND
     It's just SG-2 returning on schedule, Senator.
     There's nothing to worry about.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate shuts down.

  KINSEY
     Oh, I disagree General. I think it is something to
     worry about.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX--NIGHTTIME


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  O'NEILL
     Mister Kinsey seems to be under the impression
     that the Goa'uld are not a military threat.

  KINSEY
     You seem to have defeated them handily at every
     turn.

  O'NEILL
     Did you read all the reports, sir? They actually
     killed us once.


LOCATION--FOREST ON NOX PLANET (PC3-117)

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis and serpent guards walking through forest.
     Apophis stops, sensing something is wrong.

  APOPHIS
     Shak'l!

  ANNOTATION
     Shak'l walks in front and examines a foot print in
     the dirt. They walk into ravine. Teal'c runs out
     from cover and fires staff weapon at the serpent
     guards. Guards take cover and return fire. Carter
     pops up from undergrowth and fires her MP5 at the
     serpent guards. They respond to her fire as well
     as Teal'c's. Daniel also appears behind a boulder
     and fires his beretta at the guards. Apophis looks
     around him. O'Neill comes up behind him and takes
     aim with a rifle. Apophis turns and sees him.
     Activates a personal defence shield as O'Neill
     fires. Apophis calls to Jaffa for a staff weapon,
     which is thrown towards him. Apophis lets the
     personal defence shield down for a second to catch
     the staff weapon as O'Neill fires at him again.
     Apophis then turns and fires it at jack. The blast
     catches jack on the back and he falls to the
     ground. Carter and Daniel see O'Neill has been
     hit.

  CARTER
     Colonel!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leaps out from behind her cover, and is
     shot in the stomach by Apophis. Daniel also leaps
     from behind cover and is shot by apophis. He
     tumbles to the ground. Teal'c is still shooting at
     the serpent guards. He breaks from cover, firing
     at Apophis who still has his personal defence
     shield in place.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  CARTER
     Senator, if Goa'uld technology can generate energy
     shields around individuals, they can do the same
     thing with whole armies.

  DANIEL
     And ships.

  KINSEY
     And have you ever seen one of these "ships"?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c see a Goa'uld ship is seen on a
     computer screen.

  TEAL'C
     It is the ship of the Goa'uld Nirti. An enemy of
     Apophis.

  ANNOTATION
     From the shot of the computer screen, death
     gliders are seen launching into orbit around
     Hanka.

  O'NEILL
     Now what the hell is that?

  TEAL'C
     We must go!


LOCATION--HANKA

  ANNOTATION
     Two death gliders are firing at O'Neill (in yellow
     hazmat suit) and Teal'c as they run away from the
     ships. Shots almost hit them. They dive into
     undergrowth.

  TEAL'C
     We must get to the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     No argument from me.

  TEAL'C
     This Goa'uld Nirrti, he once sent an emissary of
     peace to negotiate a treaty concerning a Stargate
     Apophis had control of. The negotiation was a
     ploy. The Stargate was destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     More explosions. O'Neill and Teal'c run for the
     stargate along a path through a field of crops as
     death gliders fly overhead. O'Neill is almost hit
     by one shot. He falls and then gets back to his
     feet as Teal'c dials the DHD.

  O'NEILL
     Take your time. No hurry.

  END FLASHBACKS



LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  KINSEY
     You escaped, Colonel. On foot, I might add.

  DANIEL
     Just one of these Goa'uld ships was responsible
     for the deaths of SG-7 and the entire local
     population. And that's over 1,000 people.

  CARTER
     The point is, sir, we have seen how the Goa'uld
     have destroyed entire civilisations.


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Hammond, O'Neill, Carter and Daniel in
     Carter's lab. Carter talks to the blue crystal.

  CARTER
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     Crystal changes shape, refects Carter's face back.
     Everyone backs away.

  CRYSTAL
     Hello.

  CARTER
     What are you?

  CRYSTAL
     Energy. Unity. You would describe me thus.

  CARTER
     You asked for help.

  CRYSTAL
     If I remain here, my energy will disintegrate. I
     must return.

  DANIEL
     Why did you not speak before?

  CRYSTAL
     Fear.

  O'NEILL
     Fear of what?

  CRYSTAL
     The Goa'uld came to our planet long ago. We were
     not afraid then, and we tried to greet them. One
     of them touched us as you did and was destroyed by
     our energy.


LOCATION--CRYSTAL PLANET (P3X-562)

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks through the crystals, towards one.
     View from crystal's POV of O'Neill walking towards
     it and going to touch it. O'Neill touches crystal
     and is thrown back ten feet or so, unconscious.


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB

  DANIEL
     The Goa'ulds must have come through the Gate
     exploring.

  CARTER
     That's why it was afraid. We look just like them.

  DANIEL
     One of the Goa'ulds was killed?

  CRYSTAL
     They gathered all the Unity in one place, and
     ended it.

  CARTER
     We confirmed Goa'uld energy weapons did it.

  DANIEL
     Then that pit wasn't a ceremonial place at all. It
     was some kind of...mass grave.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  O'NEILL
     I'd call that a threat.

  KINSEY
     Admittedly, these Goa'uld are a dangerous race.

  TEAL'C
     More dangerous than you could possibly know.

  KINSEY
     Ah well, if they're so strong, why did you switch
     sides in the first place?

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey walks to window overlooking the Stargate.

  TEAL'C
     Because what is right cannot be measured by
     strength. Your world values freedom. I wish that
     very same freedom for my people.

  KINSEY
     Well, I don't want to appear callous, sir, but I
     believe that's your problem, not ours.

  TEAL'C
     (gets up and walks towards Kinsey) It will soon be
     yours as well, Senator Kinsey. For the Goa'uld are
     as powerful as they are evil. The Goa'uld have
     enslaved a galaxy of worlds.

  KINSEY
     I don't care about other worlds. I must place the
     citizens of this country first.

  ANNOTATION
     He points to USA flag pin on his lapel.

  TEAL'C
     Then you would be wise to heed our warnings,
     Senator Kinsey. For when the Goa'uld finally do
     come in force, and they will, your citizens as the
     strongest, most powerful country of this world,
     will be among the first to die.

  ANNOTATION
     Standoff between the two, Kinsey breaks away
     first. Teal'c looks down over the Stargate. Kinsey
     sits back at the briefing table. He looks at
     Samuels and gestures for him to continue. Samuels
     opens next folder.

  SAMUELS
     On your return from the Chulak mission, Major
     Kawalsky became infested with a Goa'uld parasite,
     correct?

  O'NEILL
     That's correct.

  KINSEY
     He very nearly destroyed this facility


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky is in the control room, possessed by
     Goa'uld, dialling up the gate. Harriman is near
     him, cradling his arm in pain. Kawalsky leaves the
     control room and goes into the Gate room as the
     blast shutter goes down on the window between the
     two rooms. Kawalsky walks into Gate room and is
     confronted by Teal'c on the ramp, blocking his
     way.

  KAWALSKY
     (in Goa'uld voice) Jaffa kal shak.

  TEAL'C
     You cannot pass.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Hammond run down the steps into the
     control room.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  HARRIMAN
     He set the coordinates for Chulak.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky roars and rushes up the ramp at Teal'c.
     They struggle.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Computer screen of autodestruct sequence. 56
     seconds to detonation.

  HAMMOND
     He set the autodestruct sequence on the fail-safe
     device.

  O'NEILL
     How did he have the code?

  HAMMOND
     I don't know. But I need two ranking officers to
     override, and you're it.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and O'Neill enter appropriate codes.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Kawalsky struggle on the ramp. Kawalsky
     tries to break through the event horizon. Teal'c
     pulls him back.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Computer screen: autodestruct sequence stops.

  O'NEILL
     All right. That did it. Open the blast doors.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Kawalsky struggling at the event
     horizon. Cut to view into the control room from
     Gate room as blast doors open. O'Neill and Hammond
     look up to see the struggle on the gate ramp.
     Teal'c and kawalsky still struggling. O'Neill
     grabs microphone.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c! Hold him there!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c forces Kawalsky's head into the event
     horizon.

  O'NEILL
     Shut it down... (indicating to Harriman) Now!

  ANNOTATION
     Event horizon shuts off and Kawalsky's face goes
     blank.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  O'NEILL
     (sadly) We stopped him.

  KINSEY
     Yes you did. On that occasion. With the loss of a
     fine officer you did. But consider the myriad
     plagues you can bring back through the Stargate.
     Reason enough to shut it down forever. (gestures
     to Samuels) Colonel Samuels.

  SAMUELS
     I quote now from the official report of General
     Hammond. Dated March of this year. Concerning a
     dangerous disease brought back by SG-1 from
     another world.


LOCATION--GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is on the phone.

  HAMMOND
     Sir, I'm afraid I have a serious situation here.
     It appears we've brought a very contagious disease
     through the Stargate. (listens) Yes, sir, that's
     right. (listens) Well sir, I've ordered the
     mountain sealed off, but I think you should order
     in an armed division to set up a second line of
     defence. (listens) Well, sir, my recommendation is
     that anyone attempting to leave the mountain
     should be shot on sight--and their body burned.


LOCATION--CELL AT SGC

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is infected by the Touched virus. SF guard
     looks through the door window and then opens the
     door. General Hammond is led into the cell. He's
     in a straightjacket and is affected by the virus.

  FRAISER
     Sorry, Colonel O'Neill, but your private room just
     became semiprivate. I'm running out of places to
     put all the victims. We've used the brigs, we've
     used the temp quarters...some of the storage
     rooms.

  O'NEILL
     (mumbles) Doctor.

  FRAISER
     Did you say something?

  O'NEILL
     Give more.

  FRAISER
     What? Give more what?

  O'NEILL
     More.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out his arm.

  FRAISER
     An injection? You...You mean you want more
     sedative? You've already had more than the maximum
     safe dosage, twice as much as anyone else because
     you've been more violent.

  O'NEILL
     Give.

  FRAISER
     No,it's not safe.

  O'NEILL
     Give! Give.

  FRAISER
     Why are you so insistent?

  ANNOTATION
     She gestures for syringe and gives O'Neill another
     shot of sedative. O'Neill loses consciousness.

  FRAISER
     Must have been in a lot of pain.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to walk away.

  O'NEILL
     Doc!

  FRAISER
     Colonel O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     Me. Me...me...

  FRAISER
     So you are still in there somewhere?

  O'NEILL
     Dream? A dream?

  FRAISER
     (shaking her head) I'm afraid not, Colonel. It's
     very real. This is interesting; enough sedative
     must knock back the primitive mind. Colonel,
     listen to me. I am not going to be able to keep
     you at this level for very long. It is too
     dangerous. It could cause permanent brain damage.

  O'NEILL
     Wha...what is it?

  FRAISER
     It's a parasitic virus. All we can tell is that it
     seems to mess with the body chemicals, all them.
     Testosterone levels skyrocket, thus the aggressive
     behaviour. It's a histaminolitic which means it
     breaks down the histamine.

  O'NEILL
     Exp...peri...ment.

  FRAISER
     What?

  O'NEILL
     Exp...eriment on me.

  FRAISER
     Experiment on you? No, sir, I can't do that.

  O'NEILL
     Use me.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  O'NEILL
     We saved an entire race of people. I'd call that a
     success, sir.

  KINSEY
     But if you hadn't been able to find a cure so
     readily, if it had reached the general population,
     if the effects weren't reversible. Colonel
     O'Neill, you very nearly died on yet another
     occasion when infected by...

  SAMUELS
     Nanocytes, sir.


LOCATION--ARGOS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate is dialing up. Daniel gathers books and
     runs down the stairs.

  DANIEL
     Jack! Carter's coming back. (he runs off to the
     hallway) Jack!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks into the room. He has aged
     significantly since last seen. Carter emerges from
     wormhole carrying a large case. She comes down the
     stairs and slows at bottom of them, staring at the
     colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Welcome back, Captain. So what did you find out?
     Oh, come on now, don't keep the elderly waiting.
     It's rude.

  CARTER
     It isn't a virus.

  O'NEILL
     All right, what is it?

  CARTER
     Well, Doctor Fraiser and I came up empty. She's
     still working on it. But it's going to take time.

  DANIEL
     Time is something these people don't have,
     Captain.

  O'NEILL
     Nor do I.

  CARTER
     Colonel, there's something else. Your blood
     samples showed way more organisms compared to the
     Argosians.

  O'NEILL
     How many more?

  CARTER
     Maybe on the level of a hundred times more. And
     they are multiplying.

  O'NEILL
     Cut to it, Captain.

  CARTER
     At the rate you're changing, by the end of two
     weeks you'll be the equivalent of 100 years old.


LOCATION--SGC, MED LAB

  CARTER
     We've given the nanocytes some live tissue to
     interact with, but they aren't touching it. The
     only thing they appear to do is make more of
     themselves. So how are they causing the aging on
     Argos?

  FRAISER
     Maybe there's something on Argos that they need to
     make them do another task. Something in the air or
     with the food.

  ANNOTATION
     Nanocytes start eating away at the gloves Carter
     is wearing.

  CARTER
     Ugh!

  ANNOTATION
     She whips hands out of gloves and closes the
     contamination chamber with nanocytes in it. Alarms
     begin to sound.

  TEAL'C
     (from observation room) Is there a problem,
     Captain Carter?

  CARTER
     I--I don't know.

  FRAISER
     Well, it's eating through the rubber.

  CARTER
     Oh, God.

  ANNOTATION
     She washes her hands.


LOCATION--OBSERVATION CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c are observing.

  FRAISER
     What? What is it?

  CARTER
     They are trying to spread.


LOCATION--OBSERVATION CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c are observing.


LOCATION--ARGOS GATE ROOM

  CARTER
     We're working with computer simulations and
     practical simulations. Realistically, sir, I'm
     afraid it might take years.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sitting on steps looking at mini video
     player with message from Carter, Daniel and
     Teal'c. He has aged significantly, with long white
     hair.

  DANIEL
     The general says that Gate travel to Argos is
     strictly off limits for the next few, uh,
     millennia. But we can send objects through, so if
     you need anything, just call. (to Teal'c) Say
     something.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel, I've learned very much from you. Thank
     you.

  CARTER
     You know, goodbyes really suck.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill rewinds the tape.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM, PRESENT DAY

  KINSEY
     As I understand it, you almost lost containment,
     Captain Carter.

  CARTER
     Yes. They tried to mutate in the lab. But after
     the incident, the general ordered all samples of
     the nanocyte destroyed.

  KINSEY
     And what about next time?

  CARTER
     There won't be a next time. The nanocytes, the
     transmitter devices, everything that tampered with
     the population of that world has been destroyed.

  DANIEL
     In fact, SG-2 just made contact with Kynthia's
     planet just a few weeks ago. They are living long,
     productive lives because of us. Now I am very
     proud of what we did there.

  O'NEILL
     I might even retire there.

  KINSEY
     (laughs) You have no fear of it, do you, Colonel?
     It's like a game to you.

  O'NEILL
     No, sir. Anything as powerful as the Stargate
     deserves respect. We know how dangerous it is to
     do what we do. We also know how important it is.

  KINSEY
     Colonel O'Neill! You're like reckless children,
     and you're playing with fire.

  O'NEILL
     If you shut down this program now, when it's
     needed most...

  KINSEY
     For what?

  CARTER
     To gather technology, weapons.

  KINSEY
     Not at this price, or this level of competence.

  HAMMOND
     My people are the best out there, Senator.

  KINSEY
     I'm sorry, General, but your best is not good
     enough. I do not approve of nor support this
     endeavour, and I have heard nothing here today
     that would change my mind. I intend to shut the
     Stargate down.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey nods to Samuels, gathers papers and leaves.
     Samuels looks smug. Daniel gets up from the table
     and blocks Senator Kinsey's path out of the room.

  DANIEL
     Senator, please. Listen to me.

  SAMUELS
     I think he's made up his mind, Doctor Jackson.

  DANIEL
     You want your one reason, I'll give it to you.
     What if I told you I knew that they were coming,
     in ships? What if I said that a ship larger than
     the great pyramids was gong to land right on top
     of this mountain in a matter of weeks, maybe days?

  KINSEY
     Then I would be curious to know why you've waited
     until this moment before saying so.

  DANIEL
     Because I didn't think anyone would believe me.
     And if I didn't live through it myself, I'm not
     sure I would. But it is a fact. And if you shut
     this program down, you will have robbed us of our
     one chance to stop them before they get here.

  KINSEY
     Uh, where did you learn this information?

  DANIEL
     On our last mission. We came across a civilisation
     with a level of technology similar to our own.
     They had been wiped out. They left behind a
     warning. "Beware the Destroyers". Now along with
     that warning, came a set of numbers, coordinates
     that indicate where the final Goa'uld attack will
     be launched from.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows his crumpled paper.

  KINSEY
     And did all of you witness this warning?

  DANIEL
     No, sir, they didn't. Just me.

  CARTER
     Sir. We think Daniel may have experienced an
     interdimensional transfer to an alternate reality.

  KINSEY
     I beg your pardon?

  DANIEL
     The moment I touched an alien artefact on 233, I
     was separated from the rest of the team. I was
     actually transported to an alternate reality where
     Earth was already under Goa'uld attack. I got this
     when I was there.

  KINSEY
     (disbelieving laughter) My heaven. I've heard
     enough of this.

  DANIEL
     Senator! The Goa'uld were bombarding our cities
     from space. We were defenceless against their
     weapons.

  KINSEY
     Doctor Jackson, I do not suffer fools gladly.

  DANIEL
     Nor do I, Senator, and I'm telling you, when we
     killed Ra two years ago, we set into motion a
     chain of events that will eventually lead to an
     all out attack on Earth by the Goa'uld.

  KINSEY
     If this is so, why have they waited?

  TEAL'C
     It would take time for Apophis to assemble the
     necessary forces.

  DANIEL
     Right. Their society is feudal. It would take time
     to build an army. Look, all I know is the location
     that they're going to launch the final attack
     from. If you don't believe me, just let us dial in
     the coordinates and let us go there and find out.

  KINSEY
     How many ships, Dr. Jackson? Has anyone detected
     their approach?

  DANIEL
     Uh, I can't be sure of the exact details. I mean
     there were, there were differences between that
     reality and...and this one.

  KINSEY
     Oh, of course there were.

  DANIEL
     I am not crazy.

  KINSEY
     Nor am I, Dr. Jackson. Neither am I unused to
     eleventh hour pleas. Though never have I heard one
     so desperate as this.

  DANIEL
     Senator. They are coming.

  KINSEY
     Then I say, let them come.

  O'NEILL
     Where do you get this bureaucratic bull? You're
     talking suicide.

  KINSEY
     Colonel O'Neill. You underestimate this great
     nation.

  TEAL'C
     It is you who underestimates the enemy. We have
     challenged Apophis. He will not rest until the
     people of this world worship him as their god.

  KINSEY
     There is only one God, sir. And I do not believe
     for one moment that He will allow what you are
     trying to tell me to come to pass. We are after
     all, one nation under God.

  O'NEILL
     (stands) And you think God is going to save us?

  TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld believe they are gods. And your
     beliefs will not dissuade them.

  KINSEY
     If the Goa'uld do come, then we will be able to
     tell them that we have buried our 'gate in the
     ground forever and will never step through it
     again. If they challenge us, we shall prevail.

  DANIEL
     You're a fool.

  KINSEY
     And if they do not come, which I think is
     infinitely more likely, then at least Pandora's
     box will have finally been closed once and for
     all. Now if you will excuse me, I have business to
     attend to.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey leaves, followed by aides.

  SAMUELS
     For what it's worth, I'm sorry it had to end like
     this.

  HAMMOND
     Get out of here!

  ANNOTATION
     Samuels leaves.

  TEAL'C
     General Hammond, I would like to request
     permission to return through the Stargate before
     it is permanently sealed. If this world does not
     intend to continue its struggle against the
     Goa'uld, then here I do not belong.

  O'NEILL
     I think I'm going with him.

  HAMMOND
     I can't allow that, Colonel. I'm sorry, but you
     know that. The President has made it perfectly
     clear if we were unable to convince the Senator we
     would cease operations effective immediately.

  CARTER
     Sir, there are still two SG teams offworld.

  HAMMOND
     We'll keep the light on until they return. But
     that's all I'm authorised to do.

  O'NEILL
     So...what? That's it?

  HAMMOND
     That's it, Colonel.

  CARTER
     It can't be.

  O'NEILL
     With all due respect, sir, it's...

  DANIEL
     Sir, with all due respect, the good senator is an
     ass.

  HAMMOND
     He is an elected official of the government we are
     sworn to serve. Whether we agree or disagree, he's
     made his decision. Our commander-in-chief has
     given us our orders accordingly. I expect you all
     to carry them out. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leaves room.
