With an apostrophe, I understand. Let me first say that though illness robbed me of the chance ever to serve in this country's military, I have the greatest respect for those who do. Especially those who have made service of country their life's work. As I have in my own way. There is no more honourable vocation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>KINSEY: Having said that, I want to make one thing abundantly clear. I am by nature suspicious of all things secretive. Be they in the government or inside the military service. I believe that which grows in shadow, but withers in the light of day...does not belong on the vine. I've read several reports of your excursions. Colonel Samuels has been kind enough to brief me on the Stargate, and I have tried to maintain an open mind. I must admit that I find the very idea of this facility, of this command, offensive. It is far too dangerous to be this secretive. I have found several examples where you have averted tragedy on a global scale by the skin of your teeth, and virtually none where you have brought back anything of worth. However since I have, on occasion, been wrong before. The President of the United States has asked me to hear you out. So here I am.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>SAMUELS: If anything, I voiced my awe and amazement at what the Stargate is: a technological marvel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>CARTER: It is so much more than that, Senator. The Stargate represents a giant step in our understanding of the universe. We have learned more about astrophysics in these few months than in the last fifty years.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>DANIEL: It also gives us insights into human cultures that are thousands of years old.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>KINSEY: Doctor Jackson, I'm sure as a scholar of ancient mythology you're familiar with the story of Pandora.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>DANIEL: From Greek mythology, of course. The first woman ever created by Zeus, who according to legend, gave her a box and warned her never to open it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>KINSEY: But she did. Out of curiosity. Despite the warning of her god, who was also her father, she did. And from it sprung all the plagues, pestilence and evil that exists now in this world.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>DANIEL: And keeping in mind that we are talking about a myth, she closed it in time to keep hope inside.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Senator if...if I may jump in here. I'm not as slick as you guys talking in metaphors here. I'm a military man. I prefer facts. And the fact is the 'gate, i.e., the box, is already open. Now what's done is done. We made ourselves an enemy by killing Ra. But the threat the Goa'ulds now represent...</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>KINSEY: Threat?</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Yes, sir. As in "threatening".</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>KINSEY: The word "threat", Colonel O'Neill, has been used far too often by this country's military as a justification for expenditures that we can no longer afford. Do you know how much this program costs?</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Seven-ish.</td></tr>
