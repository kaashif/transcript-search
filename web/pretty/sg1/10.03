Stargate Command inadvertently dialed the gate address of a planet that was on a collision course with a black hole. P3W-451, if memory serves.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>CARTER: The only way to disconnect before Cheyenne Mountain got swallowed up was to set off a shape charge right at the event horizon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She animates the schematic on the flat screen to illustrate the points she is making. An ordinary Stargate in the Pegasus would connect to a Supergate via another ordinary Stargate near the Supergate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>CARTER: Now that energy spike forced our outgoing wormhole to jump to another Stargate that was relatively close by.</td></tr>

When we first abandoned Atlantis all those millennia ago, the Earth was so harsh, its people so primitive by comparison, there was no hope of living among them as Lantians or rebuilding our society. So, instead we spread out to many lands, some of us planting a few small seeds of civilization among the first tribes of man. Others making their way to the Stargate at your southern pole. Still others choosing to live the remainder of our lives in seclusion and meditation. Merlin and I both chose the latter path.</td></tr>
