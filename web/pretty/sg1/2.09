TEASER

LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Video on the monitor from MALP footage shows the
     interior of the Abydonian Gate room and an image
     of Kasuf is seen looking in closely through the
     camera lens and tapping a finger lightly on it.
     Daniel is standing by the monitor. O'Neill,
     Carter, General Hammond and Teal'c are also in the
     room.

  DANIEL
     Now that was a few moments ago. Now obviously
     Kasuf's unburied the Stargate and is waiting. For
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks over to the table and sits down next
     to Carter.

  CARTER
     One Abydos year to the day. They kept their word.

  DANIEL
     And I have to keep mine.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you said you'd go back there in a year
     *with* Sha're.

  DANIEL
     I know that. But at least I can tell her father
     that I haven't given up, that I won't give up.

  O'NEILL
     That she's a Goa'uld?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  O'NEILL
     (pauses) Does he really need to know that?

  DANIEL
     Kasuf is family. I owe it to him.

  HAMMOND
     I have nothing against you returning to Abydos, Dr
     Jackson, but Colonel O'Neill and Captain Carter
     are due in Washington, and I can hardly ask the
     President of the United States to change his
     schedule.

  DANIEL
     Well, if I don't go back now, they will bury the
     Gate for good. It's what I told them to do if I
     never came back. General, I lived among these
     people for over a year. And I couldn't possibly be
     safer than in the company of Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     Thank you, Daniel Jackson.

  DANIEL
     (smiling) You're welcome.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson assures me the Abydonians are a
     peaceful people.

  O'NEILL
     They're a great people, are you kidding? (To
     Carter) In fact, what do you say you and I blow
     off this medal ceremony thing and go with the
     boys?

  HAMMOND
     (smiling fondly at the team) You may leave when
     ready.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate spins into activity, the wormholes
     establishes. Daniel, wearing Abydonian robes and
     Teal'c lead the way into the Gate room followed
     closely by O'Neill and Carter.

  O'NEILL
     So we'll come and pick you up in a couple of days,
     huh?

  DANIEL
     (walking up the ramp with Teal'c) And say hi to
     the President for me.

  O'NEILL
     Will do.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Daniel step through the Stargate as
     O'Neill and Carter look on from the base of the
     ramp.

LOCATION--ABYDOS PYRAMID--DAY


LOCATION--ABYDOS STARGATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf waits, looking at the MALP. Daniel and
     Teal'c come through and Kasuf is startled.

  DANIEL
     Don't be afraid, good father. This is Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     Tel ma tiak. Mal we-ai.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head.

  TEAL'C
     I am honoured.

  KASUF
     (placing his right hand over his heart and bowing)
     Bai ah kawk ma tee.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c descend the stairs, and Daniel
     kneels before Kasuf.

  DANIEL
     Good father, I ask your forgiveness, I have
     returned without your daughter.

  KASUF
     So it is.

  DANIEL
     I fear that my search will continue for many
     seasons.

  KASUF
     (Indifferently, he nods brusquely) Come.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf turns and leaves. Daniel looks up curiously
     at Teal'c who returns his gaze. Then Daniel rises
     and he and Teal'c follow Kasuf.


LOCATION--ABYDOS VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     Chickens cluck and goats bleat as Kasuf leads them
     through the village. They enter a tent in the
     village. Sha're is in the tent. She turns to see
     Daniel standing there, stunned.

  DANIEL
     Sha're!</blockquote>

  ANNOTATION
     She stands and Teal'c activates his Zat gun. Her
     eyes fall upon Daniel who sees that she is very
     pregnant.


LOCATION--DUNES OF ABYDOS


LOCATION--ABYDOS--KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're stands there with the zat aimed at her.
     Kasuf jumps in the way.

  KASUF
     No, take my life in exchange!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel puts a hand on Teal'c's arm.

  DANIEL
     Nobody's killing anybody.

  TEAL'C
     Sha're is no longer your daughter.

  DANIEL
     Kasuf, we're in danger. How long has she been
     here?

  KASUF
     More than a season.

  DANIEL
     What?

  KASUF
     Why are we in danger?

  SHA'RE
     Husband!

  DANIEL
     I am Sha're's husband. Who are you?

  SHA'RE
     My Daniel, please!

  TEAL'C
     Come no further.

  KASUF
     (putting his arm around Sha're) Good son, do your
     eyes not see?

  DANIEL
     Sha're has been taken by a Goa'uld. A demon now
     lives within her. One of great power and evil.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf turns to her in shock. Sha're bows her head
     in shame to her father.

  SHA'RE
     He speaks the truth, Father.

  KASUF
     But you said you returned to me.

  SHA'RE
     And I have.

  DANIEL
     Stop it! Okay, just stop it. You can't fool me. I
     know what you are. I've seen what you are.

  SHA'RE
     Please, believe me!

  DANIEL
     No.

  SHA'RE
     The demon sleeps because I am with child. (Daniel
     cannot speak, and Sha're pleads) Hear me, husband.
     The Goa'uld that has stolen my soul is called
     Amaunet. She sleeps for the sake of the child.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is stunned at this news.

  DANIEL
     Why?

  SHA'RE
     If she awakens, the child will come forth,
     stillborn.

  TEAL'C
     I have never known a Goa'uld to father a human
     child.

  DANIEL
     (becoming upset) Apophis is the father?

  SHA'RE
     (Sobbing) Y-Yes.

  TEAL'C
     Then Apophis is here also.

  SHA'RE
     (Sobbing) No, he has hidden me away. He does not
     want to reveal the true purpose of this child to
     his enemies.

  DANIEL
     What true purpose?

  ANNOTATION
     She sobs to her father.

  DANIEL
     Sha're! What does Apophis want with a human child?

  SHA'RE
     (tearfully) He wishes the child to one day become
     his new host.

  DANIEL
     (Stunned, then to Teal'c) Is that true?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c only looks at Daniel, who looks back at his
     wife.

  DANIEL
     Sha're.

  ANNOTATION
     She sobs as her father looks at her helplessly.

  DANIEL
     (more sternly) Is that true?

  SHA'RE
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel can only gape at her. After a few moments,
     he turns, moving his arms in a helpless display of
     outrage and leaves the tent while Teal'c looks on
     and Sha're turns to her father for solace.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--CAPITOL BUILDING


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC -A NON-DESCRIPT GOVT BUILDING

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter are descending a set of steps
     outside a building.

  O'NEILL
     You know, I can navigate myself across a galaxy,
     but I get lost every time I come to Washington.

  CARTER
     (She laughs) Don't worry Sir, these are my old
     stomping grounds.

  O'NEILL
     Sorry to hear that.

  CARTER
     Two years at the Pentagon trying to make the
     Stargate program a reality, I'd say it was time
     well spent, considering.

  O'NEILL
     Ya think?


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--RECEPTION

  ANNOTATION
     A piano plays in the background as Air Force
     military brass and other government officials are
     gathered at a celebration, schmoozing. O'Neill and
     Carter descend another set of stairs entering the
     party.

  CARTER
     I see General Hammond's already doing the rounds.

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah. He's a player. (snapping his fingers
     briskly) He knows how to work a room. Punch?

  CARTER
     Yes Sir, thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     She stay there momentarily, and General Hammond
     sees her and motions her over to him. The General
     standing before him turns around and faces her.
     Carter is surprised.

  CARTER
     Dad.


LOCATION--ABYDOS--KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf is trying to comfort his daughter.

  SHA'RE
     Daniel no longer loves me.

  TEAL'C
     You are incorrect.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf and Sha're look up at Teal'c who is standing
     by the doorway of the tent.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson cares for you greatly.

  KASUF
     (perturbed) He does not behave as a husband.

  SHA'RE
     I have seen your face before.

  TEAL'C
     As first prime of Apophis. I was present when the
     Goa'uld invaded your body. For my part, I can only
     ask your forgiveness.

  SHA'RE
     No, it is more. (Studying him) You are the
     traitor. Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     That is correct.

  KASUF
     How can you know this?

  SHA'RE
     My mind is full of images. Apophis railing and
     cursing your name. His place among the system
     lords is no more.

  TEAL'C
     Then these are the memories of the Goa'uld that
     now sleeps within you.

  SHA'RE
     Yes.


LOCATION--ABYDONIAN DUNES


LOCATION--KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leaves the tent and goes over to Daniel,
     who is seated and miserably contemplating what's
     happened and clutching dirt in his hands.

  TEAL'C
     This is most difficult. Daniel Jackson, we must
     return with Sha're through the Stargate
     immediately.</blockquote>

  DANIEL
     (Confused) Why?

  TEAL'C
     As long as the Goa'uld within her sleeps, Sha're
     shares its memories.

  DANIEL
     So...so...so what?

  TEAL'C
     It would be of great strategic benefit to have
     access to the Goa'uld genetic memory, even for a
     few days.

  DANIEL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns around and faces Teal'c, eyes red-rimmed.

  DANIEL
     Access? Do you...do you know who it is we're
     talking about?

  TEAL'C
     I do. And soon she will give birth.

  DANIEL
     Well, hasn't she gone through enough? I mean, what
     are you--what are you talking about here Teal'c?
     Handing her over to Maybourne for study?

  TEAL'C
     The knowledge she possesses could one day save
     your world.

  DANIEL
     (Outraged) I don't care! I will not...put her
     through that, too!

  ANNOTATION
     He turns away from Teal'c.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry!

  TEAL'C
     (Irritably) More sorry for yourself, it appears,
     than for Sha're. Within a matter of days, Sha're
     will give birth. The Goa'uld within her will
     reawaken. Apophis will take this child and leave
     Abydos forever. That is the fate you choose for
     Sha're by allowing her to stay!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel contemplates Teal'c words. He turns to face
     Teal'c, quiet for a moment.

  DANIEL
     Then I'd like a moment with my wife. Alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel trudges back to the tent, running a hand
     over his eyes.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--RECEPTION

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and her father are embracing.

  HAMMOND
     I invited Jake myself, Captain. I thought you
     might enjoy the surprise.

  CARTER
     Really, Sir. That's sweet.

  JACOB
     George and I served together back when the Air
     Force really was this country's first line of
     defense.

  CARTER
     It still is.

  JACOB
     Of course, it is. I was talking about when the
     Cold War was still, uh...Anyway, when George told
     me you were up for the Air Medal for your work
     in... (to Hammond) what the hell was that again?
     Um...

  CARTER
     Analysis of deep space radar telemetry.

  JACOB
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     At the punch table, O'Neill picks up two glasses
     of punch.

  O'NEILL
     (To the punch ladler guy) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks back to where Carter was.

  O'NEILL
     Sam?

  ANNOTATION
     He hands her a drink.

  CARTER
     Thank you, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel Jack O'Neill, Jacob Carter.

  O'NEILL
     (To Carter) Carter? As in?

  CARTER
     As in, my father Sir, yes.

  O'NEILL
     Get outta town. Sam's Dad? I've heard nothing
     about you, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands while Carter looks sheepish.

  JACOB
     What's there to say about an old general waiting
     to retire?

  CARTER
     Dad, I talk about you all the time.

  O'NEILL
     I retired myself one time. Couldn't stay away.

  JACOB
     (Disbelieving) From your analysis of deep space
     radar telemetry.

  O'NEILL
     Well, it's just so damn fascinating.

  JACOB
     I'm sure it is. Otherwise you wouldn't be
     receiving the Air Medal.

  O'NEILL
     We have our moments. Um, will you excuse me? We
     just don't get out of Cheyenne Mountain enough.
     I'm going to grab some air. Outside. General.
     Captain. General. (walking away) Waiter?

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  HAMMOND
     I guess I'll go make the rounds.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves, too.

  JACOB
     Just between us, your cover stories could use a
     little polish.

  CARTER
     Sorry, Dad, I don't know what you're talking
     about.

  JACOB
     No, of course not, I'm out of line. But whatever
     it is you really analyze in that mountain, deep
     space or no deep space, it can't be as exciting as
     the real thing. I'm talking about getting you into
     NASA, Carter. I'm talking about you actually going
     to space some day.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks away.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC -A NON-DESCRIPT GOVT BUILDING

  ANNOTATION
     Colonel O'Neill is walking along the sidewalk and
     is being watched by a man in a tweed jacket.


LOCATION--KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel has entered the tent. Kasuf rises from his
     seat, goes over to pat Daniel on the arm, then
     leaves the tent. Sha're rises from her seat and
     turns away from Daniel.

  SHA'RE
     You hate me.

  DANIEL
     No, no, I love you.

  SHA'RE
     Will you forgive me?

  DANIEL
     Oh, God.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks over to her, turns her around and
     embraces her warmly.

  DANIEL
     There's nothing to forgive.

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're turns away.

  SHA'RE
     I'm so ashamed.

  DANIEL
     (stroking her hair) I hate what's been done to
     you. I hate what Apophis plans for the child
     growing inside of you. Look at me.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns and he holds her chin in his hand.

  DANIEL
     I love you. Everything else... (She starts to
     weep) I love you.

  ANNOTATION
     They embrace again. They come apart, foreheads
     touching.

  SHA'RE
     Will you stay?

  DANIEL
     I can't. (Sha're looks disappointed) Because I
     want you to come home with me.

  ANNOTATION
     She smiles happily and they embrace again. Daniel
     looks worried.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--WASHINGTON MONUMENT


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--RECEPTION HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob and Carter are still talking.

  JACOB
     I made a call to Bollinger himself. Head of NASA?

  CARTER
     I know.

  JACOB
     I told him that you'd wanted to become an
     astronaut since you were a little girl. And that
     you'd given up--

  CARTER
     I didn't give up!

  JACOB
     Let me finish. That you gave up waiting for the
     shuttle program to be reinstated after the
     Challenger disaster.

  CARTER
     Yeah, it was bad timing.

  JACOB
     Yes, well. I called in a few markers. I filled
     them in on your qualifications. You apply again as
     an Air Force nominee, young lady, and I think
     you'll find NASA supportive.

  CARTER
     There's a waiting list a mile long.

  JACOB
     Not for you.

  CARTER
     Dad, you can't do that.

  JACOB
     I did.

  CARTER
     Without talking to me first?

  JACOB
     You're telling me you don't want this? They know
     what you're capable of offering the Space Program,
     Samantha, they want you!

  CARTER
     That's not the point! The work I am doing right
     now is very important to me.

  JACOB
     It's not your dream.

  CARTER
     Let's just leave it at that, please?

  JACOB
     At least talk to them, then. Do that much for me.

  CARTER
     (sighing) I knew sooner or later you'd make this
     about you.

  JACOB
     All right. (Nodding his head)

  CARTER
     (Guiltily) Dad, it's not that I don't appreciate
     it--

  JACOB
     I said "all right". I'll catch up with you after
     the ceremony.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob leaves the reception, while Carter turns
     around and sighs.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--RESTAURANT

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is seated at the end of a bar. A bartender
     is wiping down the counter as O'Neill takes a sip
     of his drink. The man in the tweed jacket that had
     been watching him earlier approaches the counter.

  SELIG
     Colonel Jack O'Neill, right?

  O'NEILL
     (O'Neill regards him suspiciously) I'm not sure.

  SELIG
     (Smiling and taking a seat near O'Neill) You are
     one hard man to find, let me tell you.

  O'NEILL
     Who are you?

  ANNOTATION
     The man pulls out a business card and sets it on
     the counter for O'Neill.

  SELIG
     Armand Selig. I'm a journalist. (To bartender)
     I'll have a beer.

  O'NEILL
     Why don't you have mine.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill finishes his drink and rises from his
     chair.

  O'NEILL
     I haven't touched it.

  SELIG
     Heading back to the Stargate so soon?

  O'NEILL
     (pulling out his wallet) The what?

  SELIG
     Big, round grayish thing. Can't miss it.

  O'NEILL
     I don't know what that is.

  ANNOTATION
     Putting down his money and leaving.

  SELIG
     Before you go, Colonel, maybe you should hear
     this. (Selig rises from his chair) I knew you were
     coming here, so I planned ahead...and I got a
     little lucky.

  ANNOTATION
     Holding up a mini-cassette recorder, he plays back
     a recording he made of O'Neill and Carter talking.

  O'NEILL
     (On tape) You know, I can navigate my way across a
     galaxy, but I get lost every time I come to
     Washington.

  CARTER
     (On tape) Don't worry, Sir. These are my old
     stomping grounds.

  O'NEILL
     (On tape) My condolences.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill listens, seemingly bored.

  CARTER
     (On tape) Two years at the Pentagon trying to make
     the Stargate program a reality, I'd say it was
     time well spent, considering.

  O'NEILL
     (On tape) Ya think?

  SELIG
     This isn't all I've got to go on, mind you. I have
     a source that told me about a device that can send
     people half way across the galaxy and back again.
     Just looking for a little confirmation.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill purses his lips and nods slightly.

  O'NEILL
     Parabolic microphone across the square, maybe?

  SELIG
     Something like that. Yeah.

  O'NEILL
     (Smiles) Technology, huh? Listen, I don't know who
     your source is, but I'm a Colonel in the US Air
     Force. A C5 Galaxy is a transport aircraft, one of
     the largest in the world. That's what I was
     referring to.

  SELIG
     And the Stargate?

  O'NEILL
     (Smiles wryly and turns away) You got me on that
     one.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off leaving Selig to return to his seat
     unsatisfied.


LOCATION--ABYDOS CITY


LOCATION--ABYDOS KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're, Kasuf, Daniel and Teal'c are seated around
     the fire in the tent.

  SHA'RE
     After the child is born, the demon within me will
     awaken again. She will punish the child for my
     disobedience.

  TEAL'C
     We would not allow that to happen. The Goa'uld
     will have become our prisoner.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stands and goes over to sit by her.

  DANIEL
     We'll have time together before the child is born.
     There'll also be questions asked of what you
     remember of the Goa'uld, but I will be there the
     whole time. I won't let them hurt you. We can
     study what keeps the Goa'uld dormant, there may
     even be a way we can remain together.

  KASUF
     Apophis will return. If she is gone, he will
     destroy the whole village.

  TEAL'C
     Tell them an enemy of Apophis came and stole
     Sha're and the child away.

  KASUF
     And it will be the truth, yes? (Teal'c nods. To
     Sha're, curtly) Go with them!

  DANIEL
     You can't just tell her like that.

  KASUF
     I'm her father.

  DANIEL
     Sha're, I won't force you.

  SHA'RE
     Once the demon returns, will I be with you then?

  DANIEL
     No. Until we can find a way to remove the Goa'uld
     within you, they would lock you up in a cell.
     That's something like a cage.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf is disturbed by this.

  TEAL'C
     So the Goa'uld within you will not harm others.

  DANIEL
     Look, I won't pretend this is going to be easy.
     But at least this way Apophis will not be allowed
     to hurt you or your child ever again.

  SHA'RE
     (She sighs) Then I will come with you, my Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel strokes her cheek gently.

  TEAL'C
     Apophis may return at any moment. We must leave
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c rises to his feet.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--RECEPTION HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is in conversation with a colonel.

  HAMMOND
     He's got great hands. He can really snap the jab.
     He was getting off all nine, so he cut in with
     three good ones, then he feinted with his right,
     came in with a left hook and right cross and the
     guy was down. (O'Neill strides in purposefully) It
     was a great--

  O'NEILL
     (Interrupting) General, a moment please?

  HAMMOND
     (To the other colonel) Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     The other officer moves off and Hammond turns to
     O'Neill. They stroll away from the common area.

  O'NEILL
     (Low voice) We've got a problem, Sir. We've sprung
     a leak. Apparently, someone with knowledge of the
     program talked to a reporter.

  HAMMOND
     This reporter approached you?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     And you said?

  O'NEILL
     Denied everything. He didn't buy it.

  HAMMOND
     Well, how much does he know?

  O'NEILL
     Well, if he knows me--he knew how to find me
     here--a lot.

  HAMMOND
     Then you're right. We've got a problem.


LOCATION--ABYDOS PYRAMID


LOCATION--ABYDOS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Sha're, and Daniel enter the Gate room.
     Daniel is holding Sha're's hand. There's a
     rumbling noise.

  SHA'RE
     Daniel, do you hear it?

  DANIEL
     Hear what? What's wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     Dust wafts down from the ceiling of the Gate room.


LOCATION--ABYDOS VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     People are shouting and animals are skittish as
     the rumbling continues. Kasuf races out of his
     tent and looks up.

  KASUF
     (Alarmed) Ben ma ha!


LOCATION--ABYDOS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     More dust drifts down.

  TEAL'C
     A Goa'uld ship approaches.

  ANNOTATION
     They are all listening when Sha're suddenly lets
     go of Daniel's hand and backs away from him.

  DANIEL
     Sha're, what's wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     For a moment, she stands there, then her eyes
     glow.

  AMAUNET
     My lord comes for me.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c activates his Zat gun pointing it at
     Sha're. Daniel pushes it down.

  DANIEL
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     He approaches her and holds her face in his hands.

  DANIEL
     Sha're, fight this thing. You have to hold on, a
     little longer, please!

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're returns to herself and sees Daniel.

  SHA'RE
     Daniel?

  DANIEL
     It's okay. It's gone now.

  SHA'RE
     (She gasps, clutching her belly) Daniel! Daniel!

  ANNOTATION
     She sinks to the floor supported by Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Teal'c! I think she just went into labour.

  TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld's return may have induced it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c goes to the DHD, and starts to dial.

  SHA'RE
     Daniel!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c stops and looks upon them then he casts his
     eyes upward.


LOCATION--ABYDOS PYRAMID FROM ABOVE

  ANNOTATION
     The mother ship is landing on top of the pyramid.


LOCATION--ABYDOS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The ring transporter is beginning to activate
     while Teal'c looks on.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson! We must leave now!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c goes over to give Daniel a hand in taking
     Share away. Then the tranport rings are activated.
     They descend, then ascending depositing Heru'ur, a
     Jaffa and three Horus guards in the Gate room. The
     Jaffa moves over to the DHD and sees some of the
     symbols lit.

  JAFFA
     My lord. Someone attempted to flee through the
     Stargate. They did not have time to escape.

  HERU'UR
     Find Apophis' queen.

  ANNOTATION
     Heru'ur stands smugly as the guard leaves.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--A DESERTED PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leads Carter and O'Neill into the empty
     room. O'Neill closes the door behind them.

  CARTER
     Say he runs this story--how bad can it get?

  ANNOTATION
     They move over to an exterior wall with a window.

  HAMMOND
     Bad. The domestic repercussions alone. Half the
     government would want to bury it, the other half
     would want a piece of it. After that, the
     international fallout when Russia and China find
     out we've been keeping it from them...

  CARTER
     Proof of the existence of aliens. Hundreds of
     other worlds populated by ancient human cultures.

  O'NEILL
     I don't see the problem.

  CARTER
     I can't help but wonder who the source could be.

  O'NEILL
     Any one of hundreds of people, Captain.

  CARTER
     I have a hard time believing it's one of ours.
     Every member of the SGC knows how important our
     work is.

  HAMMOND
     I agree with Captain Carter. It's much more likely
     political.

  CARTER
     Senator Kinsey?

  O'NEILL
     Well if he knows, at least a dozen sycophants
     know.

  HAMMOND
     Civilians sign non-disclosure statements.
     Technically, that makes them liable to prosecution
     under the Espionage Act.

  O'NEILL
     So what do we do? Sue 'em?

  HAMMOND
     There's still some time before the ceremony,
     Colonel. I'd like to know how much he knows before
     he goes to print. Do you know how to find him?

  O'NEILL
     I'll let him find me, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks away.


LOCATION--ABYDOS--A CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     A fire is lit, a pot of water boils over the fire.
     Daniel is seated behind Sha're as Teal'c returns
     presumably from securing the area. Short gasps are
     heard from Sha're as she works through labor.

  DANIEL
     It's okay. When the pain comes you have to
     breathe.

  SHA'RE
     It comes too soon!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c scoops water from a keg.

  DANIEL
     The baby will be fine, you just have to worry
     about getting through this yourself.

  SHA'RE
     When the child comes forth the demon will return.

  DANIEL
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c climbs up to the ledge where they are and
     hands Daniel the water.

  SHA'RE
     Apophis comes for me.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel wets a cloth in the water.

  TEAL'C
     (Gravely concerned) It was not the ship of
     Apophis.

  DANIEL
     (Daniel looks at him) Then who?

  ANNOTATION
     He dabs the wet cloth along Sha're's neck and
     cheek.

  TEAL'C
     It was the ship of Heru-ur.

  SHA'RE
     He is a great enemy of Apophis. He will take my
     child. (In pain) Aaaah, Daniel!

  DANIEL
     It's okay. Breathe. Breathe. This is where we hid
     from Ra. Remember? Remember?

  SHA'RE
     I remember.

  DANIEL
     We're safe here.

  TEAL'C
     You are incorrect, Daniel Jackson. If it is Sha're
     that Heru-ur seeks, he will find us. We cannot
     remain.

  DANIEL
     Well, I am not leaving her.

  TEAL'C
     The moment the child is born, the Goa'uld within
     Sha're will re-emerge.

  DANIEL
     (Pointedly) I said I am not leaving her, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c ponders this, gravely.

  TEAL'C
     Then I will do what I can to keep the Horus guard
     away from you.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves the cave. Daniel continues to minister
     Sha're as she breathes through the pain, gently
     patting the wet cloth. He kisses her cheek.

  SHA'RE
     You do love me.

  DANIEL
     Yes, I do.

  ANNOTATION
     He kisses her cheek again, and she closes her
     eyes.


LOCATION--WASHINGTON DC--USAF ADMINISTRATION BUILDING

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill exits the building, descending the steps.
     Then walks over to the bench on the first landing
     of the steps. He sits. As he waits there for a few
     moment, Selig joins him, taking a seat next to him
     on the bench.

  SELIG
     Looking for me? Find out what the reporter knows
     while your people check on his credentials.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, that's a clich, Armin.

  SELIG
     I'm very good at this, Colonel. I've been doing it
     a while. Granted, this'll be the biggest story
     I've ever broken, but then it's the biggest story
     anyone's broken, isn't it?

  O'NEILL
     Tell me.

  SELIG
     Look, I've got all I need. I don't need you, but
     I've got to admit I wanted to meet you anyway.
     When this breaks, you're going to be a hero.

  O'NEILL
     Cool. So what're you going to say about me?

  SELIG
     Subtle. Okay, I'll do you a favor. You're the team
     leader of a unit called "SG-1". Between nine and
     twelve such units operate out of Cheyenne Mountain
     under Norad. You use a device called a "Stargate"
     to travel light years from here.

  O'NEILL
     Wow, that's pretty amazing.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets up and walks away a bit. Selig rises
     also.

  SELIG
     The program costs us over seven billion. The
     Defense Department hopes to bring back superior
     technologies to offset the expenditure.

  O'NEILL
     Armin, let me do you a favor. You don't know
     anything. Don't embarrass yourself.

  SELIG
     I know that those two brilliant flashes in the
     night sky a few months ago were really alien ships
     on their way to attack Earth. You blew them up.

  O'NEILL
     I did? All right. (Sighs) If you're going to go
     ahead with it, I wanna make sure you get one thing
     right. It's O'Neill, with two Ls. There's another
     Colonel O'Neil with only one L, he has no sense of
     humor at all.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts on his sunglasses and walks away.

  SELIG
     (Following O'Neill up the steps) The story's going
     to run, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     It'll read like science fiction, Armin.

  SELIG
     This country has no official Secrets Act.

  O'NEILL
     I know that.

  SELIG
     You can't stop me.

  O'NEILL
     I know that, too.

  SELIG
     You don't think anyone'll believe it.

  ANNOTATION
     At the top of the stairs and the entrance to the
     building, O'Neill turns and faces him.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sure someone will. But it's not me.

  SELIG
     (He walks away) We'll see.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill watches him descend the steps. At the
     bottom of, Selig turns back to O'Neill.

  SELIG
     That's two Ls, right?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes his head, annoyed and starts to
     turn back into the building. The sound of tires
     squealing catches his attention. Armin has just
     turned back to the street and as O'Neill looks on,
     Selig is hit by a car, which speeds off. O'Neill
     races down the steps to Selig who lies on the
     ground.

  O'NEILL
     (To a Captain standing over the reporter) You!
     9-1-1, ambulance, now! (The officer runs off, then
     to Selig as O'Neill kneels beside him) Don't move.
     Don't try to move.

  ANNOTATION
     Civilians and Air Force personnel gather around
     the injured man.

  SELIG
     (whispering) You did this.

  O'NEILL
     (Cradling Armin's head) No. We didn't do this.

  SELIG
     Son of a bi...

  ANNOTATION
     Selig groans and then dies. O'Neill pulls his
     bloodied hands out gently out from under the
     reporter, understanding that Selig was murdered.


LOCATION--ABYDOS GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa returns. He walks up to Heru'ur.

  JAFFA
     My lord, I have questioned many in the city.
     Apophis' queen is here, as you suspected, Lord.

  HERU'UR
     Apophis will return through the Stargate to claim
     his child.

  JAFFA
     We shall be here, my lord.

  HERU'UR
     His queen and child are to be taken alive.


LOCATION--ABYDOS--KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     A Horus guard is beating Kasuf, whose hands are
     bound behind his back.

  HORUS GUARD
     (Hits Kasuf) Where is your daughter?

  KASUF
     I cannot tell you what I do not know!

  ANNOTATION
     The guard holds Kasuf's head and runs a
     two-pronged blade across his throat, drawing
     blood.

  KASUF
     What? would you have me lie?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c burst into the tent.

  TEAL'C
     Jaffa!

  ANNOTATION
     The Horus guard aims a weapon at Teal'c, but
     Teal'c shoots him with his Zat.

  EXT/INT--WASHINGTON DC--DESERTED PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM


  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is standing at the window peering out over
     the mall and the Washington Monument. Carter
     enters the room and joins him at the window.

  CARTER
     Dad? I've been looking all over for you.

  JACOB
     You must be disappointed. Any idea why the
     President cancelled?

  CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill witnessed an accident. The
     President couldn't adjust his schedule. Bad timing
     all around. General Hammond's going to present us
     with our medals at a private ceremony back at the
     base.

  JACOB
     Well, it's the honor that matters, whether I can
     be there or not.

  CARTER
     Dad--

  JACOB
     (Interrupting) I have cancer, Sam.

  CARTER
     (Stunned) What?

  JACOB
     Lymphoma.

  CARTER
     (Thinking) That's bad.

  JACOB
     (Smiling wryly) Well, it's not good. But it's not
     the worst. Don't you worry. I'll be around for a
     while.

  CARTER
     Oh God, Dad!

  ANNOTATION
     They embrace.

  JACOB
     I was hoping to stick around long enough to see
     you become an astronaut. (She shakes her head)
     Sweetheart, I don't care what it is you do in that
     mountain, nothing in the world can live up to the
     chance of actually going to space. Not for you.
     It's something you're wanted your whole life. And
     I admit it, I want to see you fulfill your life's
     dreams before I die.

  CARTER
     It's my dream. Doesn't that make it up to me?

  JACOB
     Fathers have dreams, too.

  CARTER
     (She looks at her father, sadly) Sorry, I can't...

  JACOB
     (Brusquely) All right.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns away from her, and grabs his overcoat
     from a chair.

  JACOB
     Like I said, this thing's going to go on for
     months, so you don't have to check up on me
     tomorrow.

  CARTER
     Dad, please don't go like this...

  JACOB
     Congratulations on the medal. I'm sure you deserve
     it.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away.

  CARTER
     Dad!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns back to the window, crying.


LOCATION--ABYDOS--THE CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel continues to minister to Sha're in labor.
     He is at her feet.

  SHA'RE
     (in pain) Daniel!

  DANIEL
     It's all right, Sha're. Push.

  SHA'RE
     (Desperately) No! The demon will come back!

  DANIEL
     You have to push.

  SHA'RE
     But I will lose you, Daniel!! Please!!

  DANIEL
     Look at me.

  SHA'RE
     (Screams with pain) Please!!!

  DANIEL
     Look at me! I love you! I will always love you.
     You understand? (Choking back strong emotion) The
     Goa'uld will never be able to take that away from
     us. Do you understand me? Never.

  SHA'RE
     Oh Daniel, the pain comes again!

  DANIEL
     I'm here.

  SHA'RE
     (she cries out) Daniel!!! Daniel!!!

  DANIEL
     I'm here! And now the baby is here. Now you have
     to push.

  SHA'RE
     (Breathing through the pain, she whispers) Forgive
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     As the baby's first cries are heard, Sha're's eyes
     glow.

  DANIEL
     (sniffing and then smiling) It's a boy. It's a
     boy.

  AMAUNET
     (Sitting up) Give me the child.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stands holding the baby and backing away
     from Amaunet. Suddenly, a Horus guard enters the
     cave with a zat gun in hand.

  TEAL'C
     Bring me the child of Apophis.

  ANNOTATION
     He points his zat at Amaunet. Daniel recognizes
     the voice and moves over to stand by him.

  AMAUNET
     Apophis, my pharaoh, will destroy you both for
     this.

  TEAL'C
     Tell him Heru-ur has taken his son as his own.

  ANNOTATION
     He fires the Zat gun at Sha're. Daniel looks on
     helplessly. The Horus mask is lowered revealing
     Teal'c. TEAL'C (to Daniel) We have little time. We
     must go. [The child cries and Daniel looks
     regretfully at Sha're, then at her child. Sadly,
     he turns and leaves her there. Teal'c follows him.


LOCATION--ABYDOS--KASUF'S TENT

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pulls the baby from a cradle and hands him
     to Kasuf.

  DANIEL
     It's your grandson.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf takes him into his arms and stares at him,
     smiling.

  KASUF
     He is beautiful, yes?

  DANIEL
     Yes, he is. You cannot remain here, Good Father.
     You must go into hiding.

  KASUF
     You are telling me that the demon has returned to
     reclaim my daughter.

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  KASUF
     I will need a nursing woman.

  TEAL'C
     You must find one whom you can trust. One who is
     not afraid of hardship.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf looks at Teal'c and nods.

  KASUF
     (To Daniel) So it may be that I will never see my
     daughter again.

  DANIEL
     Sha're is strong, Good Father, she will not give
     up. (Pointedly to Kasuf) And neither will I.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasuf looks down upon his grandson, smiling
     tenderly.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE--NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond pulls two medals from a tray held by a
     lieutenant.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel Jack O'Neill, Captain Samantha Carter, you
     have distinguished yourself by heroism involving
     voluntary risk of life.

  ANNOTATION
     He salutes O'Neill, who more solemnly than usual
     returns the salute. Hammond moves on to Carter.

  HAMMOND
     Against impossible odds, with only the help of
     your team members Teal'c and Dr. Daniel Jackson...
     (Hammond and Carter exchange salutes) ...you
     destroyed both Goa'uld spacecraft that were poised
     to attack this world. Your exemplary courage and
     heroism reflect great credit upon yourself and the
     United States Air Force.

  CARTER
     Thank you, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     I'm only sorry that the accident made it
     impossible for the President himself to do this.

  CARTER
     I beg to differ, Sir. It's an honour to receive it
     from you.

  HAMMOND
     (Smiling) Congratulations, Captain. I know Dr
     Jackson is expecting you on Abydos. You may ship
     out when ready.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill) I'll be geared up and ready to go in
     ten minutes, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond turns to the Lieutenant who had been
     holding the tray of medals.

  HAMMOND
     Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     After the young officer leaves, he turns back to
     O'Neill who is clearly upset over Selig's death.

  HAMMOND
     It was an accident.

  O'NEILL
     (Glumly and disbelievingly) Yes, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks away, leaving O'Neill to deal with
     his demons.


LOCATION--ABYDOS--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Daniel enter the pyramid Gate room.
     Teal'c is still in Horus guard armor. He is
     pushing Daniel ahead of his as if he's his
     prisoner.

  TEAL'C
     My lord!

  ANNOTATION
     Heru'ur descends the stairs to the Stargate
     smugly.

  HERU'UR
     Kel shak, Jaffa?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Daniel move to stand before Heru'ur.

  TEAL'C
     Kel shak, Heru-ur. The Serpent guards of Apophis
     have taken the child.

  HERU'UR
     (Examining Daniel) Who is this human?

  TEAL'C
     He claims his people are the Tau'ri, enemies of
     Apophis.

  HERU'UR
     (With disbelief) You? Among the warriors who
     defeated Apophis?

  DANIEL
     As a matter of fact, I was. The Tau'ri are
     stronger than you think. An alliance would prove
     extremely useful to both of us against our common
     enemy.

  HERU'UR
     (Amused) Alliance? You are nothing. Your world is
     nothing. Once I have conquered Apophis, I will
     make slaves of your people. You will serve me.

  DANIEL
     No, I don't think so.

  HERU'UR
     (Irritated) Kneel before your god!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel does not act immediately and Teal'c whacks
     Daniel on the back of the legs, and he falls to
     his knees.

  DANIEL
     Uhh!

  ANNOTATION
     Heru'ur regards him disgustedly. Holding out his
     ribbon device, he makes as if he's going to use it
     on Daniel when the Stargate begins to activate
     behind him.

  TEAL'C
     My lord, the Stargate!

  ANNOTATION
     Heru'ur turns to look upon the Gate.

  HERU'UR
     Apophis comes, stand ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c joins the other Horus guards to stand
     before the Stargate while Heru'ur stands by and
     watches Daniel. The vortex shoots in and Teal'c
     shoves the Horus guard next to him into it as
     Heru'ur watches. The Teal'c grabs his zat and
     shoots one of the guards. The last one shoot his
     staff at Teal'c and it appears to graze Teal'c
     shoulder. Teal'c raises his zat and shoots the
     last Horus guard but falls back against the wall.
     Heru'ur activates his personal shield, just as
     O'Neill and Carter emerge from the Stargate.
     They're a bit shocked at what they've stumbled
     upon.

  HERU'UR
     (Holding up his ribbon device) Tau'ri, kree!

  O'NEILL
     (O'Neill and Carter run for cover) What the hell?

  ANNOTATION
     They duck for cover near Teal'c, while Daniel
     jumps up and pushes away Heru'ur. As O'Neill and
     Carter are safe, Heru'ur strikes Daniel who falls
     to the fall.

  O'NEILL
     Cover me!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stands and fires off her zat at the two
     stunned Horus guards. Another shot and both
     disintegrate. O'Neill comes out firing his weapon
     at Heru'ur whose personal shield prevents the
     bullets from penetrating. O'Neill stops firing his
     weapon, and Heru'ur is smug.

  HERU'UR
     You dare challenge me?

  ANNOTATION
     He raises his hand with the ribbon device and aims
     it at O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     I was thinking about it.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls a knife from its sheath and throws it
     into the palm of Heru-ur's hand, piercing the
     ribbon device and causing it to spark.

  HERU'UR
     (In pain) You will pay for this insolence!

  ANNOTATION
     The Goa'uld activates the transport rings. They
     descend then take Heru'ur with them as they ascend
     again. Daniel is coming to his senses and Teal'c
     has deactivated his helmut.

  CARTER
     Teal'c?

  O'NEILL
     Somebody explain to me what just happened?

  TEAL'C
     It is a lengthy tale, O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Long story, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes over to see about Daniel. Teal'c and
     Carter follow him.

  CARTER
     Good thing you remembered the shield's deflection
     capability's directly proportional to the amount
     of kinetic energy directed at it.

  O'NEILL
     (Looking at her as he gives Daniel a hand) Right.
     (To Daniel) We should get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate starts dialing up again.

  DANIEL AND TEAL'C TOGETHER
     Apophis

  O'NEILL
     (Incredulous) What?

  TEAL'C
     We must cover ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 duck behind cover. Momentarily, the Stargate
     engages. Two serpent guards emerge, followed by
     Apophis and five other Jaffa. Daniel and Teal'c,
     O'Neill and Carter watch from their hiding place.

  APOPHIS
     Jaffa. Kel Amaunet.

  AMAUNET
     I am here, my pharoah.

  ANNOTATION
     Amaunet enters the pyramid Gate room, elaborately
     dressed. Apophis joins her near the DHD.

  APOPHIS
     (puzzled) The child?

  AMAUNET
     Stolen, by your enemy, Heru-ur. (bowing her head)
     Forgive me, my pharoah, for failing you.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis appears angry, but gently touches her
     cheek as Daniel looks on.

  APOPHIS
     Jaffa! Shal tek!

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa goes back to dial the Gate and Amaunet
     stares directly at Daniel. Teal'c seems stunned
     that she's not said anything.

  APOPHIS
     (Holding out his hand) Come home with me, my
     queen.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin to leave and Amaunet again looks
     directly at Daniel and continues on. O'Neill looks
     at Daniel as Apophis, Amaunet and their guards go
     through the Stargate. It soon disengages. SG-1
     then emerge from their hiding places.

  CARTER
     Sir, there's still a Goa'uld ship on top of us.

  O'NEILL
     Dial us home Captain, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter dials the Gate. Daniel can only stare
     helplessly at the Gate.

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) You all right?

  DANIEL
     No. No, I'm not. (To O'Neill) But I will be.

  TEAL'C
     She looked directly at us, Daniel Jackson, yet she
     did not reveal our position.

  ANNOTATION
     The GDO beeps--the iris code is sent.

  O'NEILL
     (A hand on Daniel's shoulder) Let's go home.

  ANNOTATION
     He moves on, and Teal'c also lays a hand on
     Daniel, then moves to the Stargate followed by
     Carter. After a moment, Daniel follows.
