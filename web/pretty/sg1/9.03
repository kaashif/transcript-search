Origin Part 3
TEASER

LOCATION--PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The ground is a flat stone surface, covered with a
     few inches of water. A ring platform activates,
     with rings rising through the small amount of
     water. Prior One, Vala and Daniel appear.

  DANIEL
     Where are we?

  PRIOR ONE
     The Plains of Celestis.

  VALA
     And that?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala points. In the distance is a large golden
     city reflecting the daylight. It has large towers,
     domed roofs, various spires, and other ornate
     structuring.

  PRIOR ONE
     City of the Gods.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala exchange looks. The Prior starts
     walking towards the city. Daniel and Vala follow.

  DANIEL
     Maybe you could tell me who you are.

  PRIOR ONE
     I am a Prior of the Ori.

  DANIEL
     And what is that?

  PRIOR ONE
     In time, all in due time.


LOCATION--CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     Prior One leads them down a large corridor. Its
     floors and walls are marble, and tall ornate
     windows overlook the city. Vala and Daniel look
     around as they walk. A set of double doors opens
     at the end of the hall, and the Prior leads them
     into a windowed room decorated with large pictures
     similar to medieval tapestries. It is furnished
     with a large dining table and chairs. Candles on
     pillars are at either side of the doorway. On the
     dining table is a silver bowl of fruit and a large
     book. Once Vala and Daniel fully enter the room,
     the Prior turns and leaves, the doors shutting
     behind him. Vala and Daniel turn and approach the
     closing doors as they realize they're being locked
     in.

  DANIEL
     (voice rising) Uh, I guess we'll just wait here?
     Is that what we're going to do?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala sighs.


LOCATION--P3X-421, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     In a desert, a tented settlement sets near the
     Stargate. People, dressed in desert robes, are
     going about their daily activities when the
     Stargate activates. The villagers approach the
     Stargate. A lone figure steps through. It is
     another Prior. He too is wearing a hooded robe and
     carries a blue orbed staff. He also carries a book
     similar to what was on the dining table in the
     room where Daniel and Vala now are. Prior Two
     lowers his hood. His head is bald. Like Prior One,
     his skin is pale and his eyes are milky-colored
     and slightly off-focus. He looks at the villagers.

  PRIOR TWO
     Hallowed are the Ori.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell, Lam, and Teal'c are all seated at the
     table. Landry is pacing by the end of the table
     nearest his office.

  LAM
     Both Daniel and Vala's vitals have been stable for
     two hours now.

  LANDRY
     What about disconnecting them from the device?

  LAM
     Dr. Lee has been unable to remove the stones.

  MITCHELL
     We haven't tried C-4 yet, sir.

  LAM
     (sternly) Dr. Lee is working on disabling the
     power source. But given that the device is tied
     directly into their minds, I recommend we proceed
     with caution.

  LANDRY
     (voice rising as he speaks) I understand. But if
     one or both of them run into trouble again, I'm
     ordering you to take whatever action is necessary
     to shut that thing down!

  ANNOTATION
     Lam glares but stays silent.

  LANDRY
     Teal'c, a word.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry enters his office. Teal'c follows.


LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  LANDRY
     What can you tell me about this Gerak fellow?

  TEAL'C
     He was First Prime of Montu, a minor Goa'uld who
     served Ra, then later fell in with Ba'al when Ra
     was killed. After the fall of the Goa'uld, Ba'al's
     armada was led by a Jaffa named Hubrok. Hubrok was
     an ally of Bra'tac's and would have supported our
     desire to reform the Jaffa nation with democracy.
     However, approximately four months ago, Hubrok
     disappeared.

  LANDRY
     You think Gerak had something to do with it?

  TEAL'C
     (nodding assent) Mmm, though no evidence has been
     uncovered. But shortly after Hubrok's
     disappearance, Gerak emerged as spokesperson for
     the more traditional ways of the Jaffa High
     Council.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry sits in his chair.

  LANDRY
     Which he could control.

  TEAL'C
     Through a series of slow and deliberate
     manipulations, the Council played squarely into
     Gerak's hands.

  LANDRY
     Well, that makes him one of the most powerful guys
     out there...at least that we know of. I suppose I
     should meet him face to face.

  TEAL'C
     (bowing) I will extend your invitation.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c exits the office.


LOCATION--CITY OF THE GODS ON THE PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY


LOCATION--DINING ROOM, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting at the end of the table, reading
     the book. Vala is lying on her back on top of the
     table.

  VALA
     All right, Daniel, what does it say?

  DANIEL
     Well, it seems to follow suit with many of the
     religions I've studied. They tend to weave their
     doctrines into simple fable-like narratives with
     characters that are meant to be identifiable to a
     common individual.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala turns and sits up, groaning and stretching
     lazily.

  VALA
     Well, why don't you read one to me? I love a good
     yarn.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel glances at her and turns a page of the
     book.

  DANIEL
     Well, they all seem to teach meditation on one's
     worth and significance, the path of righteousness
     towards a state of higher being.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala takes a bite of an apple from the fruit bowl,
     then offers the apple to Daniel. Daniel looks at
     her with slight alarm.

  VALA
     (oblivious to the reference) What? I'm starving.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes a deep breath, but does not explain.
     Vala continues to eat the apple.

  DANIEL
     The central icon of the religion seems to be fire.

  VALA
     I don't need a book to tell me that.

  DANIEL
     (thinking out loud) That would make sense. Fire is
     light, energy, warmth...and yet, on Earth, at some
     point, fire became associated with demonic
     imagery. Things that are evil. Hell, not heaven.

  VALA
     (still eating) And?

  DANIEL
     I was just wondering if the Ancients had something
     to do with that.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala stretches out across the table again, this
     time on her stomach, propped up by her elbows She
     reaches towards the tome.

  VALA
     Tell you what, why don't you flip to the end, and
     see how it all turns out, hmm?

  ANNOTATION
     While speaking, Vala turns a large section of
     pages at once so that the last page of the book is
     showing. She pats it a few times and looks at
     Daniel. Daniel glares at her in irritation. They
     both hear a thud and turn to the door. The door
     opens on its own and Prior One enters. Vala jumps
     to her feet and hides the half eaten apple back in
     the fruit bowl. She attempts to disguise that she
     still has a piece of apple in her mouth.

  PRIOR ONE
     The village of Ver Ager has been corrupted.

  VALA
     (mouth full of apple) We didn't do it. I promise.

  DANIEL
     We are connected to these people, Harrid and
     Sallis, by means of a communication device that
     was brought to our galaxy a long time ago by a
     race of people called the Alterans.

  VALA
     (swallowing the last of her apple) Also known as
     the Ancients?

  ANNOTATION
     Prior One does not react.

  DANIEL
     (stuttering) L-look the point is, we meant no
     harm. Um, we're explorers.

  PRIOR ONE
     You know of others in Ver Ager?

  DANIEL
     Others?

  PRIOR ONE
     Unbelievers.

  VALA
     (moving around table) Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want
     us to tell on people who don't believe in the Ori?

  PRIOR ONE
     Devotion is rewarded.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala glances at Daniel in alarm before turning
     back to the Prior.

  PRIOR ONE
     (continuing) Those who stray must be guided back
     to the path.

  VALA
     (skeptical) Seems to me those who stray get burned
     to death.

  PRIOR ONE
     The Ori gave all men and women free will.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala approaches and circles Prior One. Daniel
     stays seated, following the conversation closely.

  VALA
     If the Ori are so powerful, why do they need us to
     tell them who believes in them and who doesn't?

  PRIOR ONE
     The Ori need nothing from us.

  DANIEL
     (smiling to himself) It is we who must seek the
     truth of the universe in order to achieve
     enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala looks at Daniel. He shrugs slightly.

  DANIEL
     Been down this road before.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is sitting in a chair, looking down into
     the isolation room, where Lam and medical staff
     are monitoring Daniel and Vala. The communication
     device is by the foot of their beds, glowing. Lee
     is sitting by the device, working on something.
     Landry approaches Mitchell's side. Mitchell starts
     to rise.

  LANDRY
     At ease, Colonel. How are they doing?

  MITCHELL
     There's no change, sir.

  LANDRY
     I know you're concerned for them. So am I, but
     I've got something else for you to do.

  MITCHELL
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry pulls up a chair and sits next to Mitchell.

  LANDRY
     Just got a report from Dr. Lindsay on P3X-421.

  MITCHELL
     (thinking) Lindsay...anthropologist, right?

  LANDRY
     (nodding) She's been working with the human
     population on 421, helping them get over the loss
     of their former false god.

  MITCHELL
     Trouble?

  LANDRY
     Well, it seems a missionary of sorts came through
     the Gate yesterday and started spouting a religion
     we haven't encountered before--I mean, not that we
     have a problem with people exploring different
     faiths.

  MITCHELL
     (still concentrating on Daniel and Vala) I suspect
     we'll see a lot of opportunists try to fill the
     void by the Goa'uld, sir.

  LANDRY
     Hmm. This new found freedom is quickly going to
     bring about desperation if people don't learn to
     fend for themselves. A lot of these, uh shall we
     say, "sheltered civilizations" could potentially
     be taken advantage of by a charlatan with a flashy
     bag of tricks.

  MITCHELL
     (looking at Landry) And in this case?

  LANDRY
     (scoffing) Well, this missionary's apparently
     trying to prove the validity of his claims by
     performing miracles.

  MITCHELL
     Miracles?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry stands. Mitchell immediately follows suit
     in the presence of his superior officer.

  LANDRY
     I'd like you take SG-12 and check it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell glances a couple more times through the
     window before responding.

  MITCHELL
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  PRIOR ONE
     (in monotone) ...Amica was forgiven his
     transgression and found his way back to the path.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is still seated at the end of the table by
     the open book. Vala is seated in a chair next to
     him, her head leaning on her hand in boredom.

  VALA
     I can't take much more of this.

  DANIEL
     Um, sorry to interrupt, but um, if you brought us
     here to try and convert us, I think it's fair to
     tell you that we're really not in the market for
     "new gods."

  PRIOR ONE
     The will of the Ori brought you here.

  DANIEL
     (offhand) I don't suppose we could talk to one of
     these "Ori"?

  PRIOR ONE
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala both stand upright, surprised at
     this response.

  DANIEL
     (stuttering) Uh, well great. Th-th-that would be
     great.

  PRIOR ONE
     Speak, and they shall hear you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala realize the Prior is referring to
     prayer and sigh.

  DANIEL
     Oh.

  VALA
     Okay look, you can torture us all you want with
     your rhetoric, but we're not going to crack--Well,
     I might--But we're not going to tell you anything
     because we don't know anything. (turns to Daniel)
     Am I right?

  DANIEL
     Uh, can I talk to your boss? Um, the uh...uh...
     (flips through book) The Doci, um, the one who
     speaks the word of the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior turns his attention to Daniel.

  DANIEL
     (reading from text) Uh..."like Egidius of Vil
     Dare, I need to speak things that can only be
     spoken in the light of fire."

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at Prior One hopefully.

  PRIOR ONE
     Come with me.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors open and Prior One walks out. Daniel and
     Vala follow.

  VALA
     (to Daniel) Could you not have asked that an hour
     ago? We've been listening to him drone on and
     on...

  PRIOR ONE
     Not you.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala stops walking just inside the threshold.

  VALA
     What? Not who? Not me? But I...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns back and sees the doors close on
     Vala's face as she sighs. Daniel follows the
     Prior.

  VALA
     (through closed door) I-I'll wait here.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A color guard of Jaffa step through an active
     Stargate. Teal'c and Landry stand at the bottom of
     the ramp. Armed SFs are scattered throughout the
     room. Gerak steps through the Stargate with his
     aide Yat'yir. Gerak wears a full Jaffa military
     uniform with a fur cape.

  LANDRY
     (low, to Teal'c) Quite the entourage.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry leaves Teal'c's side and walks up the ramp
     to greet Gerak. He holds out his right hand for
     Gerak to shake.

  LANDRY
     Welcome.

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak pauses, studying both Landry and Teal'c, who
     still stands at the ramp's base, before taking
     Landry's hand. Teal'c watches stoically, glaring
     at Gerak.


LOCATION--P3X-421, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers are all gathered around Prior Two,
     who is reading from his book.

  PRIOR TWO
     "...as he lay there, dying in the sun, the sands
     of the desert all around him, Petrus spoke to the
     rock, not with his lips, but with his mind. And
     the rock wept tears of fresh water, and his thirst
     was quenched." (closing book) Fear not the Ori.
     Fear the darkness that would conceal the knowledge
     of the universe. Believe in the truth of all
     things, and you too may find the path to
     enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     Behind Prior Two, Mitchell, Lindsay, and SG-12
     approach from the Stargate.

  MITCHELL
     "And a man has no greater thing under the sun than
     to eat, drink and be merry." Ecclesiastes. My
     favorite.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior turns at their approach. Mitchell
     continues with a disarming smile, his voice taking
     on a bit of a Southern drawl.

  MITCHELL
     My grandma was a bit of a bible thumper. Weekends
     at Grandma's meant long, long Sundays at St.
     Hilda's Church of the Grand Epiphany. (normal
     voice) Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell. How
     you doing?

  PRIOR TWO
     I am a Prior of the Ori.

  MITCHELL
     It's nice to meet you.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior passes Mitchell and heads in the
     direction of the Stargate.

  PRIOR TWO
     Your arrival here was foreseen.

  MITCHELL
     No kidding. So, you see the future, do you?

  PRIOR TWO
     Lessons of days gone by teach us what will come to
     pass.

  MITCHELL
     I'm a bit of a history buff myself. Doesn't help
     me pick the lotto numbers, though. So, where're
     you from?

  PRIOR TWO
     Where we come from and where we are going are all
     the same.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, I get you. "Wherever you go, there you are."
     (aside to Lindsay) Think that's Buckaroo Banzai.
     (to Prior) Me, I'm from a little planet called
     Earth.

  PRIOR TWO
     The home of Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell makes a sideways glance at Lindsay.

  LINDSAY
     (nervous) He never mentioned that before.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell turns back to the Prior, and they
     appraise each other.

  MITCHELL
     (after a pause) You know Doctor Jackson, do you?

  PRIOR TWO
     From him did we learn of your need.

  MITCHELL
     Our need for what?

  PRIOR TWO
     The revelation of your destiny.


LOCATION--CITY OF THE GODS ON THE PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY


LOCATION--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     A set of tall doors opens, revealing the interior
     of the chamber. A statue of an ankh-like symbol
     with a light purple smooth oval stone sits between
     two pillars at the far end. It is otherwise
     unfurnished. The Doci stands in front of this
     symbol. One side of the room is decorated with a
     tall, ornate, cast iron fence, a double gate in
     its center. Beyond this fence is a wall of fire.
     Prior One and Daniel enter the room.

  PRIOR ONE
     Doci.

  ANNOTATION
     The Doci turns from the symbol and faces Daniel.
     He is dressed in a long, high necked, white robe.
     On top of the robe is a full length, silver,
     patterned adornment similar in shape to the ankh
     symbol with a small purple stone set near the
     chest; the decoration continues past the robe and
     surrounds either side of the Doci's head like a
     collar. Like the Prior, his face is powder white,
     and his eyes have a milky, off color cast. His
     face is scarred in a purposeful way, with
     deliberate markings.

  DOCI
     Leave us.

  ANNOTATION
     Prior One exits the chamber; the doors close
     behind him. Daniel half turns to watch the Prior's
     movements, gathering his thoughts. Eventually, he
     turns back to the Doci.

  DANIEL
     (smiling tentatively) Hello. I'm uh--

  DOCI
     Daniel Jackson.

  DANIEL
     (nonplussed) Right.

  DOCI
     From the planet Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel blinks.

  DANIEL
     Okay. So you know my name and where I'm from, so I
     assume you'll also know how I'm connected to this
     man's mind. Why I'm here...uh. You see,
     we're...we're explorers. We'd very much like to
     get to know you. Um. Your society. How you came to
     be.

  DOCI
     A Prior has been dispatched to the place from
     whence you come.

  DANIEL
     Really? You can-you can do that? I thought we were
     in another galaxy.

  DOCI
     It is the will of the Ori that we should spread
     Origin to all those blessed by their creation.

  DANIEL
     Okay, well, I think you should understand that
     there are many different kinds of people in the
     place "from whence I come"...um...people who
     believe in many different things.

  DOCI
     They shall find the path to enlightenment.

  DANIEL
     Right. Well I-I think you should also understand
     that they may not see your way as the only way.

  DOCI
     The power and the greatness of the Ori cannot be
     denied. Those who reject the path to enlightenment
     must be destroyed.

  DANIEL
     Right. I was afraid of that.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Teal'c escort Gerak and Yat'yir around
     a corner and down the hallway. Landry and Gerak
     converse while Teal'c and Yat'yir size each other
     up.

  LANDRY
     George Washington, one of our country's founding
     fathers and first president, once said: "True
     friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must
     undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity
     before it is entitled to the appellation."

  GERAK
     The First Prime of Horus, Karrok of the High
     Plains, once said: "There is more honor in dying
     at the hands of a brother than there is killing a
     would-be friend."

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, standing behind Landry, clenches his jaw.
     Landry considers this statement for a moment
     before responding.

  LANDRY
     He was a wise man.

  GERAK
     He was killed shortly after losing one of the
     greatest battles in history.

  LANDRY
     (lightly) Oh. Well, I hope it wasn't his brother
     that shot him.

  GERAK
     It was me. The Jaffa was a fool in every respect.
     He did not deserve an honorable death.

  LANDRY
     (soberly) I see.

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons blare and a strobe light comes on in the
     hallway.

  HARRIMAN
     (over loudspeaker) Unscheduled incoming wormhole.

  LANDRY
     (chuckles uncomfortably) I better see what this is
     about. Uh, Teal'c, please escort our guests to the
     briefing room.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry makes a formal bow in the manner Teal'c
     often does. Gerak nods casually in return.


LOCATION--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  DOCI
     The Book of Origin says: "those who seek the path
     to enlightenment must not be led astray."

  DANIEL
     Right. See that can be interpreted a number of
     different ways. I think maybe I know what the Ori
     are--uh--who they are, um, and I'm not denying
     they are very powerful beings, but if I'm right,
     they're not gods. If they're like the ascended
     beings I know, they simply have a greater
     understanding of the knowledge of the universe.

  DOCI
     What is a god, but a being that is worshiped by
     those beneath? Is great knowledge, power,
     understanding not enough for you to revere the
     Ori?

  DANIEL
     Respect, yes, certainly. But that doesn't mean I
     would murder innocent people in their name. I
     guess what I'm trying to understand is whether the
     Ori have spoken to you directly and told you to
     worship them, or whether you've...misinterpreted
     some evidence you've found along the way and
     developed this religion on your own. I can't speak
     for everyone in my galaxy, but in my own humble
     opinion, I don't believe that any individual or
     society can achieve enlightenment through
     fear-mongering and forced servitude, no matter
     what power is presented as evidence. That's
     something the ascended beings I know very clearly
     seem to understand. Don't get me wrong, I mean, we
     should all be trying to better ourselves. I mean
     if-if ascension is the ultimate end we're trying
     to achieve, then so be it, but we should all be
     allowed to get there or not of our own free will.
     You can kill me for saying that, but that is what
     I believe and nothing you say or do will EVER
     change my mind.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel waits nervously for the Doci's response.

  DOCI
     (after a pause) Come.

  ANNOTATION
     The Doci goes to the gate and opens it. Daniel
     follows warily. They step out onto a balcony.

  DOCI
     The Ori hear you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks down. The wall of fire extends as far
     as the eye can see. The Doci spreads his arms
     wide, and a white brightness appears in front of
     him. Daniel steps back in alarm. Strings of flames
     shoot out, passing Daniel, who cringes at their
     approach. The strings of flame enter the Doci. The
     Doci turns, and looks at Daniel through flame
     filled eyes. He begins to speak in an echoing
     voice that sounds like many voices speaking in
     unison behind the voice of the Doci.

  POSSESSED DOCI
     We do not require blind faith. Only that you
     believe what you see and know to be true.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is already seated. Landry stands by a chair
     at the head of the table. Gerak has draped his fur
     cape over the back of a chair and is pacing around
     the room. Yat'yir stands near him. Harriman places
     folders by every seat.

  LANDRY
     I realize this is just a friendly meeting. But on
     behalf of our planet's leaders, I've been asked to
     present a few thoughts for you to consider. Uh,
     some points that we can discuss in the future.
     Possibly looking forward to an official treaty
     between our world and the Jaffa nation.

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak looks through the briefing room window into
     the Gate room.

  GERAK
     Who is that?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry stands to join Gerak at the window. He
     looks down to see Mitchell, SG-12, and Prior Two
     coming out of the active Stargate.

  LANDRY
     (sighing) Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell, SG-12, and
     a gentleman we encountered on another planet who
     claims that he represents some gods called the
     Ori. I think we have yet to see the real fallout
     from dismantling the infrastructure established by
     the Goa'uld.

  GERAK
     Indeed. We have already seen the rise of
     individuals and organizations who have threatened
     to challenge us.

  ANNOTATION
     Yat'yir turns to stare at Teal'c, who returns the
     stare.

  LANDRY
     There are as many humans out there as there are
     Jaffa. But if we don't continue to work together,
     the victory that we both worked so long and hard
     for could result in chaos.

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak looks down at the Gate room again before
     striding back to his seat.


LOCATION--DOCI CHAMBER BALCONY, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  POSSESSED DOCI
     We are Ori.

  DANIEL
     And you instruct these people to worship you?

  POSSESSED DOCI
     We are their creators. All who follow the path
     will join us in enlightenment.

  DANIEL
     Do you know who the Alterans are?

  POSSESSED DOCI
     Those who abandon the path are evil.

  DANIEL
     Evil? Why?

  POSSESSED DOCI
     They shielded you.

  DANIEL
     (flatly) Really. I didn't really think they did
     much of anything for us, but I guess I was wrong.

  POSSESSED DOCI
     The truth of the universe has been obstructed. All
     will know the power of the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel blinks and takes a deep breath, very
     worried. The strings of flame shoot out from the
     Doci's chest and return to the wall of fire.

  DOCI
     (in normal voice) Hallowed are the Ori.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lam checks Daniel's heart with her stethoscope.
     Lee hovers nearby. Satisfied, Lam places the
     stethoscope back around her neck.

  LAM
     Vitals are returning to normal.

  LEE
     I wonder what that was all about.

  LAM
     (checking the monitors for both patients) I don't
     know, but he was in some sort of stress.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee looks up to the observation room, where
     Mitchell and Prior Two are entering.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Prior Two look down into the
     isolation room. Mitchell stands with his hands
     crossed over his chest.

  MITCHELL
     We can't seem to disconnect the stones or turn off
     the device.

  PRIOR TWO
     It is the will of the Ori.

  MITCHELL
     I figured you might say that. You sure there's
     nothing you can do? If you help us out here, I'll
     guarantee we'll be more receptive to those stories
     you want to tell. Call it a miracle if you want.

  PRIOR TWO
     When Hannor Mir fell from above and learned to fly
     on the way down...that was a miracle.

  MITCHELL
     Right.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Landry, Gerak, and Yat'yir are seated
     around the briefing table.

  YAT'YIR
     These planets you have mentioned. All have
     plentiful naquadah mines on them.

  TEAL'C
     And substantial human populations.

  YAT'YIR
     Whose side are you on, Jaffa?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leans forward in his chair.

  LANDRY
     There are no sides here. Just topics of
     conversation.

  GERAK
     I wish to meet this Prior of the Ori. If he
     preaches faith in false gods, then that is a
     concern for all of us. I wish to hear his claims
     and challenge him.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Landry, and Gerak all exchange looks.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks ahead of Prior One, heading to the
     doors at the end of the corridor, which open at
     their approach. Daniel enters the dining room
     where Vala waits. Prior One turns away from them
     as the door closes, standing guard at the
     entrance.


LOCATION--DINING ROOM, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     Vala stands by a large wooden cabinet near the
     windows. Daniel circles the table to join her.

  VALA
     What's going on?

  DANIEL
     This is bad.

  VALA
     Worse than being burned to death?

  DANIEL
     It appears our ascended Ancients and the Ori have
     a slight difference of opinion. See the Ori seem
     to think that because they're ascended, humans
     beings should worship them. All humans.

  VALA
     And if we don't?

  DANIEL
     Then we're not worthy of living and should be
     destroyed.

  VALA
     I don't think enlightenment means what they think
     it means.

  DANIEL
     See, apparently our ascended Ancients have been
     shielding our existence from the Ori.

  VALA
     They've been protecting us?

  DANIEL
     The Ori seem to think that our Ancients are evil
     because they haven't shared the secrets of the
     universe with us.

  VALA
     Well, I hate secrets--at least, the ones I don't
     know.

  DANIEL
     See, the problem is the Ori now know our galaxy's
     inhabited by humans because of US!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gestures angrily between Vala and himself.
     Vala points back at him.

  VALA
     I refuse to accept the blame for that. Curiosity
     is part of human nature. Look, if the Ancients
     knew that the Ori were so bad, why didn't they
     stop us from coming here?

  DANIEL
     Free will.

  VALA
     Right. (pauses) If they have been protecting us,
     there's no reason to believe they won't continue.

  DANIEL
     The Ancients may be protecting us from the Ori,
     but not their human followers. See, Ancients won't
     interfere on any lower planes of existence. If
     anybody from our galaxy wants to worship the Ori,
     apparently, that's our choice. And they won't stop
     Priors from coming through the Gate because
     apparently, they've already sent one.

  VALA
     The Ori have given Priors special powers and
     that's not fair.

  DANIEL
     They're still human. Now, highly evolved humans
     can have some pretty amazing abilities. They're
     using the secrets of the universe that the Ori
     have given them to spread word of the Ori's
     godliness. And when people don't see the light,
     it's going to be--

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel makes a cutting motion across his throat
     with his hand.

  VALA
     (despairing) What are we going to do?

  DANIEL
     I don't know. I'm starting to think that sending
     Priors is just the beginning. We could be talking
     Crusade here. We need to warn Earth.

  VALA
     We need to get out of these people.


LOCATION--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     Prior One walks up behind the Doci, who is staring
     out at the wall of fire. The Doci turns to face
     him.

  DOCI
     Take the unbelievers back to Ver Ager. Let its
     cleansing mark forever the beginning of a new age.
     Evil has raised a great many unbelievers in a
     far-off place. They must be shown the path.

  PRIOR ONE
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  DOCI
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     Prior One bows and leaves the chamber.


LOCATION--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Villagers wander through the square on their daily
     business. None seem upset or bothered by the
     immolation they witnessed earlier.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala stand in the main room of the
     house and look out the window at the village.

  VALA
     What are we doing? Why did he bring us back here?

  ANNOTATION
     They turn away from the window and move further
     into the room.

  DANIEL
     I think he's using us to weed out any other
     heretics that might be here.

  VALA
     I still don't get why the Ori just don't do it
     themselves. They're supposed to be gods. Aren't
     gods all seeing, all knowing, all powerful?

  DANIEL
     Well, the universe is infinite, remember?
     Apparently, that's a lot to keep track of.

  VALA
     I suppose.

  DANIEL
     They didn't even know about our galaxy...well,
     until recently.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stands still, lost in thought. Vala notices
     his silence.

  VALA
     (in a comforting tone) It's not our fault.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala stands in front of the mirror and gestures at
     her reflection, which is the image of Sallis.

  VALA
     (appearing as Sallis) You'd think at least they'd
     keep on top of their own people.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel crosses the room to look back out of the
     window. As he crosses past the mirror, the image
     of Harrid reflects in the mirror.

  DANIEL
     (appearing as Harrid) I get the feeling the Ori
     let their devout followers...

  DANIEL
     ...do their enforcing for them. It confirms their
     loyalty.

  VALA
     (leaning against a pillar) Okay, why did we let
     the Prior bring us back here?

  DANIEL
     Well, because I don't think he was going to give
     us much choice. And besides, I'm starting to think
     that that might be our best way to contact Earth
     and warn them about what we know.

  VALA
     How?

  DANIEL
     Well, Fannis said that his sect had found other
     artifacts.

  VALA
     You think they also have a terminal device to go
     with the stones.

  DANIEL
     If they do and we can find it and hook up the
     stones, maybe we can get this communication thing
     going both ways.

  VALA
     Right. If the Prior is using us to weed out other
     unbelievers, how do we make contact with Fannis
     without giving him away?

  DANIEL
     We can't.

  ANNOTATION
     Both Daniel and Vala look troubled.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Prior Two is standing. Landry, Teal'c, Gerak, and
     Yat'yir all sit at the table. SFs guard every
     entrance to the room. Mitchell stands between
     where Teal'c and Landry are seated.

  PRIOR TWO
     You do not believe in a higher power?

  LANDRY
     Well, it's complicated. There are a lot of
     different points of view about that subject around
     here.

  TEAL'C
     Jaffa have recently shed the dominance of false
     gods that have enslaved us for many generations.

  GERAK
     But many have long believed in the path to
     enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c observes Gerak with interest.

  PRIOR TWO
     Origin will guide you on this path. And those who
     revere its wisdom shall be uplifted. I have come
     to spread the word to the unbelievers who have
     been sheltered and raised by evil.

  MITCHELL
     (leaning down and speaking softly to Landry) You
     have no idea how much he sounds like my Grandma.


LOCATION--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Birds sing. A large white moon shines through the
     clouds to light the valley and village.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Vala and Daniel are standing in the bedroom. Vala
     struggles with the clasp of a cloak. Daniel is
     across the room by the wardrobe, adjusting his own
     cloak.

  VALA
     It's a pretty big village. I suspect that Fannis
     and his gang did a reasonable job hiding their
     sacrilegious artifacts.

  DANIEL
     Well, we have to do something.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a knock at a door which leads outside.
     Vala goes to the window. Daniel reaches in the
     wardrobe and retrieves a heavy metal vase. He
     looks at Vala. She looks out the window and sees a
     lone hooded figure holding a lamp. She is unable
     to identify who it is. She shakes her head at
     Daniel and shrugs. He opens the door, staying out
     of sight behind it. Fannis enters, smiling as soon
     as he sees Vala and throwing back his hood. Daniel
     comes up behind him, about to strike him down with
     the vase.

  VALA
     (waving frantically) No no no!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel holds back at the last moment as Fannis
     turns and cringes.

  DANIEL
     (gasping in irritation) Fannis!

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis sighs in relief. Daniel pushes him further
     into the room and shuts the door.

  DANIEL
     You shouldn't have come. They're using us to get
     to you.

  FANNIS
     So I suspected. Either that, or you have truly
     come to see the power of the Ori.

  VALA
     Not bloody likely.

  DANIEL
     (earnest pleading) You have to leave.

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis clasps his hand on Daniel's shoulder.

  FANNIS
     If I can help you speak the reality of our
     existence to your people, maybe one day in turn,
     you will spread that word back here.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel considers this, then nods to Vala. She
     turns and goes to get the book containing the
     black Ancient communication stones from its hiding
     place at the bed.

  DANIEL
     You said you had other artifacts besides the
     stones.

  FANNIS
     (smiling) I'll show you.

  DANIEL
     No! Just tell me! Now, we're looking for a large
     dome-shaped object with a blue crystal on top. The
     stones fit inside of it.

  FANNIS
     (smiles) Come.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to the door.

  DANIEL
     (pleading) Fannis! You're risking your life.

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis turns back and approaches Daniel, speaking
     in a serious, earnest tone.

  FANNIS
     Harrid, Sallis, and I, all those who believe as we
     do, have known for some time that we may give our
     lives for our cause. We can only hope one day the
     truth comes to bear as a result.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns back and walks to the door. Vala and
     Daniel exchange looks. Vala hands Daniel the book.
     Daniel hands Vala the vase. They don their hoods
     and follow Fannis.


LOCATION--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     An older man leaves an alley and walks into the
     main street. He passes three hooded figures. They
     are Daniel, Fannis, and Vala. Looking around to
     make sure no one is watching, the three walk down
     the alley to a small doorway.


LOCATION--HIDDEN ROOM, VILLAGE OF VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis and Daniel uncover and open a wooden crate.
     Nestled inside is an Ancient communication device,
     identical to the one at the SGC. Vala and Fannis
     grin at each other. Daniel takes the black stones
     out of the book, which he hands to Fannis. He
     hands one stone to Vala. They both stand over the
     device.

  DANIEL
     And...

  ANNOTATION
     Vala and Daniel place the stones on the device.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lee is standing close to Daniel's monitors. A
     nurse observes Vala's. Lee sees a spike in a
     reading.

  LEE
     Whoa, uh, something just happened.

  ANNOTATION
     Lam bends over Daniel and uses her penlight to
     check for dilation response in his eyes. She
     places her fingers around his throat to check
     other vitals. Daniel grabs her wrist and opens his
     eyes, looking around warily.


LOCATION--HIDDEN ROOM, VILLAGE OF VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis smiles. Harrid and Sallis stand up straight
     from being hunched over the communication device.
     They look at each other and smile. Fannis
     continues grinning, then makes a choked sound in
     his throat, leaning back. Prior One comes down a
     staircase into the room, the blue orb of his staff
     glowing brightly. The Ancient communication device
     shuts off. Daniel is once again inside Harrid.

  DANIEL
     Fannis?

  ANNOTATION
     Prior One reaches the bottom of the staircase.
     Fannis drops to his knees, unable to breathe.
     Vala, back in Sallis's body, spins to see what
     Fannis is staring at and spots the Prior. The
     Prior raises his hand and telekinetically throws
     Daniel through the air, knocking the breath out of
     him when he impacts the wall. Daniel is unable to
     move and is pinned three feet above the floor.
     Fannis collapses onto his back, still gasping for
     air.

  PRIOR ONE
     And the people shall deliver the wicked unto your
     divine judgment, where their sins shall be weighed
     in balance with all that is just and true.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala stares at Prior One. Fannis becomes limp and
     stops breathing entirely. Daniel remains pinned
     and appears in pain.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     A group of villagers drag Vala and Daniel into the
     square. Both have their hands tied in front of
     them. Vala is being carried, one villager holding
     her by the waist, one by her legs. She kicks and
     twists her body, trying to break free. Two other
     villagers struggle with Daniel, who's also
     fighting against them. Following behind them is
     Prior One, walking in his slow, processional gait.

  VALA
     (desperately) The Ori are great! I love the Ori!
     I'm a believer! What's the matter with you people?
     I'm telling you, I've seen the light! (calling
     over to Daniel) I don't think they're buying it.

  DANIEL
     Well, I've heard you do better.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel twists free enough to elbow one of the
     villagers restraining him. The other villager
     maintains his hold, and the first punches Daniel
     in the gut, doubling him over and making him cry
     out in pain. The villagers wrestle them both into
     the circular, maze like stone structure where Vala
     was sacrificed before. They are forced to their
     knees, with their hands shackled behind them on
     opposite sides of the yoke like bench in the
     center of the maze. Vala grunts in resistence. A
     large crowd gathers around. The Administrator
     walks along the edge of the pattern.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Glorious are the Ori, who lead us to salvation,
     who didst fight the evil that would doom us to
     mortal sin. Did they defeat the old spirits and
     cast them out. And now, with the strength of our
     will, they do call upon us to prevail against the
     corruption of all unbelievers.

  VALA
     (gulping) Well, second time's the charm.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel twists his head to look back at her in
     disbelief.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  PRIOR TWO
     The Ori do not shield this knowledge as others
     might, selfish in their powerful advantage. They
     lead you to their realm in the path that is laid
     out in The Book of Origin. All you need do is
     follow their teachings.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman enters the room and whispers in Landry's
     ear. Landry rises.

  LANDRY
     I'm very sorry. You'll have to excuse us for a
     moment. Please continue. (to Mitchell) Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Mitchell follow Harriman out of the
     room.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lam is standing in the corridor, waiting to talk
     to them.

  LAM
     They woke up just for a moment, and then they lost
     consciousness again.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry sighs in disappointment.

  MITCHELL
     Did they say anything?

  LAM
     Yes, they did.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Guide us on the path, so that we may triumph over
     the enemy of our salvation, and be with you in the
     end of ends on the Plains of Enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     As the Administrator speaks, Prior One takes a
     prominent place among the crowd. Daniel glances at
     the crowd. Vala fights back tears. Both look
     resigned.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell enters the room and draws his sidearm,
     pointing it at Prior Two. Following him are other
     armed SFs. The guards already stationed in the
     room react to their colleagues by also aiming
     their weapons at Prior Two. Gerak and Yat'yir
     stand. Teal'c remains seated.

  GERAK
     (angrily) What's the meaning of this?

  LANDRY
     I'm very sorry. We've just received some
     information about our visitor here that demands we
     take every precaution.

  MITCHELL
     We'll have to take the staff, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He motions to an SF, who reaches out, grabs the
     staff, and moves several feet away.

  MITCHELL
     And you'll have to come with us.

  GERAK
     I demand to know what you've learned.

  PRIOR TWO
     (reasonably) All I wish to do is spread the word
     of the Ori to your world.

  LANDRY
     Actually, that was never going to happen.

  PRIOR TWO
     Then I must leave at once.

  MITCHELL
     That's not going to happen, either.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  PRIOR ONE
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  VILLAGERS
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala look nauseous. Prior One lifts his
     staff, and the bucket of flammable fluid ignites
     on its own.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  PRIOR TWO
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     Prior Two reaches out his hand, and his staff
     flies out of the SF's grasp into his own. The blue
     orb at the top shines with a bright glow. Teal'c
     stands.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Villagers tip the bucket, and the fiery fluid
     drains into the track that channels through the
     circular maze. Vala, facing the fire, and Daniel
     twisting around, both watch its progress with
     alarm.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Prior Two bursts into flame. Everyone else rears
     back in astonishment.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The fiery liquid has already tracked through most
     of the maze and quickly approaches the center.
     Daniel and Vala each try to stay as close to the
     center as possible, cringing against the heat of
     the flames.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Prior Two stands calmly as the fire engulfs him,
     then disappears, the flames rising into
     nothingness. Everyone left in the room stares at
     the smoke; there is no other trace of Prior Two.

  VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER

     Mitchell sets the safety on his sidearm and runs
     out of the room. Teal'c follows.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel begins to gasp for breath. Vala shudders
     and tries to make herself smaller. Prior One and
     the villagers watch impassively as the flames inch
     closer.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c enter, followed by an SF.
     Medical staff and Lee swarm around Daniel and
     Vala, who are in distress. Monitors are beeping
     rapidly and erratically.

  LAM
     Same as before, only this time, it's both of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c head to the communication
     device. Lee spots where they're going and tries to
     head them off.

  LEE
     Now, now, hold on. This device draws its power
     directly from subspace. It will react very badly
     to an explosion. You can't blow it up.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps we should send it through the Stargate?

  MITCHELL
     Genius.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c unhook the device from the
     leads attaching it to the monitoring equipment.
     Lee is forced to duck when Mitchell and Teal'c
     lift the device and start carrying it. Once the
     device passes over his head, Lee stands and
     follows. All the while, Lee protests their
     actions.

  LEE
     No. Well, it also uses subspace to communicate
     with another galaxy across the universe. I mean,
     there's no reason to believe that Daniel and Vala
     won't stay connected to it, even from another
     planet.

  MITCHELL
     I have a different idea. Tell them to start
     dialing the Gate.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Mitchell hurry from the room with the
     device. Lee stops at the door.

  LEE
     (calling after them) Where to?

  MITCHELL
     (calling back) Wherever.

  LEE
     (muttering to himself) Wherever? Where...All
     right.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee shrugs, picks up the phone and starts dialing


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The fiery liquid reaches the center part of the
     maze. Daniel's and Vala's backs are practically
     touching each other as they lean away from the
     flames. They are both gasping for air.

     of the Stargate spins and a second chevron locks
     into place.

LOCATION--SGC CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Mitchell hurry through the corridors,
     carrying the Ancient communication device. SGC
     personnel scatter to avoid them as they rush past.

  MITCHELL
     (yelling ahead) Out of the way! Out. Of. The. Way!


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala are alternating between holding
     their breaths and gasping for oxygen, panicking at
     the flames surrounding them. They strain against
     the shackles to no effect. Prior One watches these
     events with no reaction.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The computer screen confirms the encoding of a
     sixth chevron.

  HARRIMAN

  ANNOTATION
     Vala and Daniel are helpless against the
     surrounding flames.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A heart monitor shows a flat line, sounding a
     steady whine. Lam listens to Vala's heart with her
     stethoscope.

  LEE
     Blood pressure's dropping. The heart rate's
     rising. They're going into shock!


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Mitchell spin around a corner and run
     down the corridor with the device, dodging
     personnel as they turn and enter the Gate room.

  MITCHELL
     (as he passes through the door) Now!


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  HARRIMAN
     Resuming dialing sequence. Chevron Seven, locked!

  ANNOTATION
     The computer monitor confirms the seventh chevron
     locking.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c heave the Ancient
     communication device into the air just as the
     wormhole activates. The device disappears into the
     Kawoosh, disintegrating. Mitchell and Teal'c dive
     to the floor at the bottom of the gate ramp.


LOCATION--VER AGER VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala can hardly breathe through the
     flames and smoke. In the next instant, it is
     Harrid and Sallis in their spots, struggling as
     the flames surround them. They appear terrified
     and distraught.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  LAM
     Charging to 200.

  ANNOTATION
     A nurse squirts gel on defibrillator paddles Lam
     is holding. Lam spreads the gel by rubbing the two
     paddles together and moves towards Daniel, who's
     in full cardiac arrest.

  LAM
     Clear!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel's scrub shirt has been cut open, a couple
     of monitor leads are stuck to his chest. As Lam
     reaches down with the paddles, Daniel's eyes open.
     Lam halts moments before she shocks him. Daniel
     looks around wildly. Vala is being attended to by
     Lee. She wakes up suddenly, half-rising from the
     bed and gasping for air. Lee looks at her in
     shock, then smiles. Lam turns at her gasp and
     appraises their condition by looking at the
     monitors. The monitors beep erratically, then
     gradually the beeping smoothes to steady
     intervals. Daniel looks at Vala. Vala leans on her
     elbows and looks around in a panicked manner,
     putting a hand to her throat as she tries to take
     in oxygen. She looks towards Daniel.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Mitchell stand and look up at the
     control room.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The phone rings. Landry moves to answer it.

  LANDRY
     General Landry.

  ANNOTATION
     He listens on the phone for a minute, then hangs
     up and walks back and looks through the window at
     Mitchell and Teal'c.

  LANDRY
     (through intercom microphone) Dr. Lam says that
     Daniel and Vala have regained consciousness. Well
     done!


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods in acknowledgment and gives a small
     smile.

  MITCHELL
     (gesturing with his arms wide) See, THAT'S what
     I'm talking about.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Mitchell grasp each other by the arm in
     congratulations.


LOCATION--CITY OF THE GODS ON THE PLAINS OF CELESTIS, DAY


LOCATION--DOCI CHAMBER, CITY OF THE GODS, CELESTIS

  ANNOTATION
     The Doci stands at the balcony, looking out at the
     wall of fire. Behind him in the room, Prior One
     and the Administrator approach. When the
     Administrator draws near, he bows low. The Doci
     turns to acknowledge him.

  DOCI
     You have served the Ori well.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     (bowing head) I bow in humble account.

  DOCI
     Come, and gaze upon the flames of enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     The Doci moves to the side and gestures. The
     Administrator approaches with humble trepidation
     and stands beside him on the balcony. Prior One
     watches.

  DOCI
     Let its power wash over you.

  ANNOTATION
     The Doci steps back. The Administrator spreads his
     arms wide, and a white brightness appears. The
     Doci and Prior One look on as the Administrator
     staggers slightly at the impact of the power from
     the Ori. His black hair whitens, his skin pales,
     and his eyes take on a milky countenance. He now
     looks identical to the Priors. He lowers his arms
     and turns to the Doci.

  DOCI
     (snarling) Great holy armies shall be gathered and
     trained to fight all who embrace evil. In the name
     of the gods, ships shall be built to carry our
     warriors out amongst the stars, and we will spread
     Origin to all the unbelievers. The power of the
     Ori will be felt far and wide, and the wicked
     shall be vanquished.

  ADMINISTRATOR/PRIOR THREE
     (bowing head) Hallowed are the Ori.

  DOCI
     Hallowed are the Ori.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is standing by the center worktable,
     wearing green BDU's. Teal'c stands beside him,
     also wearing SGC garb. Vala, dressed in a blue air
     force jumpsuit, is sitting on the table. Daniel's
     right arm is outstretched. Vala holds a red
     crystal over his wrist, and the Goa'uld kor mak
     bracelet releases and uncurls, balancing straight
     on top of his wrist. Daniel picks up the bracelet
     while she repeats the process on her own wrist.

  DANIEL
     (softly) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala gives him a small quiet smile. Mitchell
     appears at the doorway.

  MITCHELL
     (leaning on door frame) General Landry is ready
     for us.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods and smiles at Mitchell in
     acknowledgment. The three exit the room.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Vala, Teal'c, and Mitchell are seated at
     the table. Landry paces the room, studying the
     pattern of the etched star chart window. Vala's
     body language has changed from her previously
     brazen, confident manner. She sits huddled, her
     knees against her chest, arms wrapped around her
     legs. Daniel sits beside her, his elbows leaning
     on the armrests, fingers interlaced in a
     contemplative gesture. Mitchell is sitting in a
     relaxed, casual posture, leaning back slightly.
     Teal'c is sitting stoically next to him.

  LANDRY
     So you think we should expect more of these Priors
     to show up?

  DANIEL
     (nodding) I would be very surprised if they
     didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry sits at the head of the table and Mitchell
     leans forward in his chair.

  MITCHELL
     How? We know one came through the Stargate, but if
     their galaxy is so far away--

  VALA
     (quietly) I suspect the Ori have the power to make
     a lot of things happen.

  DANIEL
     (shifting in his chair) Still, for the Priors, I
     think we can assume it's a one-way trip.

  MITCHELL
     (in a serious tone) Don't think they have a
     problem with self-sacrifice.

  LANDRY
     You think the Ancients here in our galaxy will
     continue to stop the Ori from using their power to
     attack us directly?

  DANIEL
     I hope so. I...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel shrugs and shakes his head.

  MITCHELL
     So how do we fight these guys? And I mean the
     message as much as the men. A lot of folks out
     there are going to buy what these guys are
     selling.

  TEAL'C
     Hopefully, now many have been educated to the ways
     of false gods.

  VALA
     (shaking her head) Yes, but we're not talking
     about humans with snakes in their heads with a
     slightly better understanding of technology.

  DANIEL
     See, their power isn't false. The Priors are going
     to offer to people what will seem like proof of
     God.

  LANDRY
     Proof of powerful beings is not proof of God.

  DANIEL
     I'm not saying it is.

  MITCHELL
     Look, just because we know there is some beings on
     a higher plane of existence than ourselves does
     not mean there's not an order of being higher than
     them. At least I reckon that's what my Grandma'd
     say.

  VALA
     (smiling at Daniel) And the universe is supposedly
     infinite.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel does a double take at Vala's comment.

  LANDRY
     Which in my book makes it's impossible to know
     everything. I mean, somewhere in there, you gotta
     fill in the blanks with a little faith. (smiles at
     Mitchell) I had a grandma too.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles. Landry stands. Mitchell rises as
     well.

  MITCHELL
     So, business as usual, sir?

  LANDRY
     Let `em bring it. We'll use our strengths against
     their weaknesses. That's a pretty good strategy
     for any kind of business you're in. (In a softer
     tone to Daniel and Vala) I'm glad you two are
     okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks down, lost in thought. Vala looks
     towards the ceiling, shaking her head.

  MITCHELL
     Amen.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting at his computer, typing on the
     keyboard. O'Neill, in full dress uniform, enters
     the office. Daniel looks up from typing and
     acknowledges O'Neill.

  DANIEL
     Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel blinks as he realizes O'Neill is no longer
     a familiar presence at the SGC.

  DANIEL
     Wow. What the hell are you doing here?

  O'NEILL
     (annoyed) Nice to see you, too.

  DANIEL
     (standing) No, no, sorry. It's just...I wasn't
     expecting to see you.

  O'NEILL
     Nah. Well, I was in the neighborhood.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods, confused.

  O'NEILL
     And I've got a little surprise for...Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     O'NEILL winces slightly.

  DANIEL
     Oh. Yeah. He loved the last one. The fact that you
     didn't tell him that we were all moving on to
     different positions.

  O'NEILL
     (in low voice) Yeah. (pauses) Sorry you missed
     Daedalus.

  DANIEL
     No, you're not.

  O'NEILL
     (unabashed) You're right, I'm not.

  ANNOTATION
     There is an awkward pause.

  O'NEILL
     Listen, I just had a briefing with
     Landry...about...your stuff.

  DANIEL
     (voice trails off) Yeah.

  O'NEILL
     Sounds like it could be a problem.

  DANIEL
     (shrugging) Well, we've been up against some
     pretty bad guys before.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, not so pretty. Overdressed, yes.

  DANIEL
     Been through some tough situations.

  O'NEILL
     That we always won.

  DANIEL
     (with a self-conscious smile) Yeah...but didn't
     you feel that was because we had someone looking
     out for us?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Daniel shrewdly.

  DANIEL
     I don't think I would say this to anyone else, but
     for the first time, I'm scared.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill raises his eyebrows. Daniel looks away and
     sighs.

  O'NEILL
     (after a pause) I'm hungry.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks back towards Jack, and after a
     moment, smiles slightly.

  DANIEL
     (nodding) Me too.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures towards the door with his head.

  O'NEILL
     Wanna?

  DANIEL
     (shrugging) Mm-hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the office.


LOCATION--SKY, EARTH, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     An F-302 flies through the air. There are few
     clouds. Mitchell sits in the cockpit; O'Neill is
     behind him in the co-pilot seat.

  MITCHELL
     (drawling) Yeah, man. This is good.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill smiles.

  MITCHELL
     Still a rush.

  O'NEILL
     (in bored tone) Yeah.

  MITCHELL
     I don't know why I didn't get back on the horse
     sooner, except I really didn't think you could
     take one of these things for a joy ride.

  O'NEILL
     Now, see, that's one of the great things about
     being a general. You pretty much get to do
     whatever you want.

  MITCHELL
     I suppose after you've saved the world seven or
     eight times...

  O'NEILL
     (smirking) Who's counting, huh?

  MITCHELL
     Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill studies Mitchell with a penetrating look.

  MITCHELL
     (continuing) Actually, he mentions it quite often.

  O'NEILL
     So, Mitchell, I hear you haven't picked out your
     team yet.

  MITCHELL
     I'm hoping I won't have to, sir. Why, did General
     Landry say something about it, sir?

  O'NEILL
     He did.

  MITCHELL
     Are you going to tell me, sir?

  O'NEILL
     (firmly) He said you're going to be fine,
     Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     (smiling) Thank you, sir. You mind if I kick in
     the afterburners, sir?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, please.

  MITCHELL
     Thank you, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The F-302 races across the sky.
