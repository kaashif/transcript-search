Vala and Daniel look around as they walk. A set of double doors opens at the end of the hall, and the Prior leads them into a windowed room decorated with large pictures similar to medieval tapestries. It is furnished with a large dining table and chairs. Candles on pillars are at either side of the doorway. On the dining table is a silver bowl of fruit and a large book. Once Vala and Daniel fully enter the room, the Prior turns and leaves, the doors shutting behind him. Vala and Daniel turn and approach the closing doors as they realize they're being locked in.</td></tr>

He too is wearing a hooded robe and carries a blue orbed staff. He also carries a book similar to what was on the dining table in the room where Daniel and Vala now are. Prior Two lowers his hood. His head is bald. Like Prior One, his skin is pale and his eyes are milky-colored and slightly off-focus. He looks at the villagers.</td></tr>

After the fall of the Goa'uld, Ba'al's armada was led by a Jaffa named Hubrok. Hubrok was an ally of Bra'tac's and would have supported our desire to reform the Jaffa nation with democracy.

She wakes up suddenly, half-rising from the bed and gasping for air. Lee looks at her in shock, then smiles. Lam turns at her gasp and appraises their condition by looking at the monitors. The monitors beep erratically, then gradually the beeping smoothes to steady intervals. Daniel looks at Vala. Vala leans on her elbows and looks around in a panicked manner, putting a hand to her throat as she tries to take in oxygen. She looks towards Daniel.</td></tr>
