<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>DANIEL: Of course, it makes sense. The Goa'uld impersonating the Devil would naturally create a place like Netu. Netu is from the book of Am-Taut which is kind of a how-to guide on passage through the ancient Egyptian otherworld regions. And many of those regions are described as dark places with pits of fire--home to hellish monsters and the damned.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>MARTOUF: What little we know is largely based on the legends that have been perpetuated by Sokar himself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Anyone curious as to why?</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>MARTOUF: I implored her, but she would not say.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>CARTER: I only carried Jolinar for a short time. I've never had anything more than scattered flashes of her memories, occasionally some dreams, but certainly never anything like this place you're describing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>MARTOUF: The Tok'ra have technology that aids in the recall of memories, but you must be willing to use it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Well, if we're going in on this one, sir, we're going to need a couple more units.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>MARTOUF: A full military incursion will be impossible, Colonel O'Neill.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>MARTOUF: Selmak's recovery is obviously a high priority, however, and forgive me, Samantha, but there is something larger at stake here. The Tok'ra believe that Sokar is about to launch a massive attack against the System Lords.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Isn't that good news?</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>TEAL'C: The chaotic and feudal disorganization of the System Lords' fragmented rule is a far more vulnerable target than that of one powerful Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>HAMMOND: He's really that much worse than the others?</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, of all the gods he picked to impersonate he chose the Devil.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>MARTOUF: We need to find Selmak and determine what information he has gathered about Sokar's planned attack. Without wanting to sound overly dramatic, the fate of the Galaxy may be at stake.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Sounds a bit overly dramatic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>MARTOUF: He cannot. The atmosphere around the moon is impenetrable by ship. The only way to reach the surface is in the descent pods.

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>MARTOUF: The moon was once an industrialized colony of the planet Delmak. When Sokar conquered Delmak and made it his home world, he transformed the moon's environment to suit the myths.</td></tr>
