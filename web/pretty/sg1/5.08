<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM</td></tr>
<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>CARTER: We've seen their logs and the list of planets they visited, and P2X 338 was not one of them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Perhaps they deceived us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>HAMMOND: At the moment all they're admitting to is that there may have been some unauthorized use of their Gate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>O'NEILL: What's that supposed to mean?</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>HAMMOND: This is Major Valentine Kirensky. He was serving under Colonel Sakolov at the base in Siberia. It now appears that he was also taking secret orders from certain hard-line elements in Russian Army Intelligence. He disappeared six days before we were called in to deactivate the Russian Gate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>CARTER: And they think he went off-world?</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Along with two other officers and an archaeologist named Alexander Britski.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>DANIEL: I know his work. He's an expert on ancient Mesopotamia.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Why would they go behind Sakolov's back?</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Perhaps for the same reason the NID conducted off-world operations without the knowledge of Stargate Command.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>DANIEL: To steal alien technology at any cost.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>CARTER: But why 338 as opposed to any other planet?</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>HAMMOND: That has yet to be determined.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>DANIEL: If they went through the Gate before everyone at the Russian base was killed, they could still be out there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>CARTER: It's doubtful they would've survived this long. The planet's surface temperature averages 135 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Shade? I don't remember shade.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>DANIEL: They could've taken shelter in the temple.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>DANIEL: I'll figure out the door.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Should they not have attempted to return by now?</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>CARTER: Not without exposing their operation. I mean, they could still be waiting for some kind of signal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>O'NEILL: She's got a point, sir. Russian commandos can be pretty hard-core. They'd wait forever before they'd violate mission protocol.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>HAMMOND: I'm aware of that, Colonel. That's why we're going to allow a second Russian team to accompany you back to the planet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Excuse me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>HAMMOND: It's going to be a joint mission--full disclosure, full cooperation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>HAMMOND: In fact, the Russians have been pushing for more direct involvement in the Stargate Program for quite some time. We've been resisting, but in this particular case, it might be useful to have them onboard.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Yes, well, General, you know, I'm a big fan of the Russians, and international relations are a bit of a hobby of mine. However, I do believe that SG-1 should handle this one... alone.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>HAMMOND: The decision's been made, Colonel. They're on their way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>O'NEILL: No.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>DANIEL: Ziggurat. And yes, I think I have. In order to expedite matters, the Russians e-mailed me the entire report of their archaeologist, Dr. Britski. The temple is dedicated to the Babylonian God, Marduk.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>CARTER: And Marduk was a Goa'uld?</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, it seems likely. The word "Babylon" literally means "Gate of the Gods," so if there is a connection, it wouldn't surprise me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>DANIEL: Two years ago, Dr. Alexander Britski began an excavation near Rafha in Southern Iraq. He found several stone tablets engraved with Babylonian cuneiform, and one with a set of symbols he didn't recognize.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>CARTER: Gate coordinates.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>DANIEL: In fact, the coordinates for P2X-338. Dr. Britski had no idea of their significance, but someone must have recognized something, because the results of the dig were never published, and the whole thing became classified.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Wait a minute. Two years ago, the Russians hadn't even seen a Stargate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>CARTER: So when they finally got their program up and running, they must have added P2X 338 to the list of addresses supplied by Colonel Maybourne.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>ZUKHOV: You took it upon yourselves to represent the interests of the entire planet without consulting anyone. You exposed the world to countless dangers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>DANIEL: Uh, yeah. The engravings of the entranceway are a kind of code. It's like a giant combination lock. It's just a matter of activating the correct symbols in the proper sequence.</td></tr>
