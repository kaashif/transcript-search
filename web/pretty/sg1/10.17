But entering into a war without leadership, without proper organization would merely be mass suicide. We must learn from our mistakes in overthrowing the Goa'uld. For generations, we have plotted and fought for our emancipation. Never once did we plan for what we would do with that freedom after it was ours... The resulting infighting and weakness after our victory over the Goa'uld is what leads us to this vulnerability at the hands of the Ori now.</td></tr>

Suspicious, Teal'c begins to follow. A few seconds later, one of the tents explodes. Several victims scream in pain and terror.</td></tr>
