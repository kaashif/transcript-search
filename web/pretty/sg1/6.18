O'NEILL How many were there.... of you? WARRICK My crew was eight, including myself. We watched them in shifts. My first officer and I were looking for food and water when they overpowered the men guarding them and killed them in cold blood. Corso then took over the ship and used its defenses against us. We tried many times to retake the Seberus, but recently we were just lucky to stay alive. They hunted us like wild animals. You must believe me. They are the worst that Hebridan has to offer.
