As one SF tries to attack her, she throws him to the floor. The other SFs fire again. Teal and Carter run through the corridors towards the gunfire. Replicator Carter, smiling slightly, attacks the SFs, who all end up on the floor. She walks over to touch a keyboard and the power come on. She moves to place her hand fully on the keyboard and the gate starts activating very quickly. As Teal'c and Carter arrive in the doorway, Replicator Carter smirks at them, then moves towards the gate. Teal'c runs to stop her from going through the gate and Carter runs to the terminals.
