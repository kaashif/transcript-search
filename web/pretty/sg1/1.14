<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: A square of light is revealed as a piece of stone falls. Flashlight beams cross in the darkness, then three people come down stone steps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>DR KLEINHOUSE: Would you look at this! Many of us suspected there was another chamber, but the Mexican government wouldn't let us dig the compartment...'til now.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The flashlight beam falls on a large, golden shape, the only thing in the chamber.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>DR COLE: What's this? It looks like a sarcophagus.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>DR KLEINHOUSE: Burial chambers in Mayan temple house are very rare indeed. Here. (Pulls out a brush) Look for glyphs, pictographs. Something to give us a hint who's inside. (He feels reveals pictures) Hieroglyphics.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>DR COLE: (brushing more dust off the top, revealing the shapes beneath) My God. They're Egyptian. That doesn't make any sense. Egyptian hieroglyphics in a Mayan temple?</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>DR KLEINHOUSE: I read a journal article once by a young archaeologist. What was his name? Uh, Dr Jackson. Dr Daniel Jackson. He was laughed right out of academia for his preposterous ideas about a connection between various ancient civilizations.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>DR COLE: Maybe Dr Jackson was onto something. I recognize one of these pictographs. It's of the goddess Hathor. The Egyptian goddess.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: DR KLEINHOUSE brushes off more dust, revealing a glowing red stone in the top of the sarcophagus, similar to the center of a DHD. DR KLEINHOUSE places his palm on the stone, and twists it. There is a grinding sound, and the top of the sarcophagus shifts. DR COLE hides behind DR KLEINHOUSE. Slowly the top slides apart, a perfectly manicured hand reaches out, then a beautiful woman, clad in an Egyptian headdress sits up, her eyes running over the invaders.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>DANIEL: Dr Kleinhouse and his associates were killed brutally. The Mexican authorities assume it was by crypt robbers looking to steal anything in the burial vault. Like this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>DANIEL: Uh, Dr Kleinhouse's other associates, who were outside the pyramid. They recognized the significance of an Egyptian sarcophagus in a Mayan temple. And, since I was the only one to ever do research in cross pollinization of ancient cultures, they tracked me down.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>DANIEL: I don't know. But if it does belong to a Goa'uld, it would explain a lot. Like why there's no one in it, and why it has Egyptian hieroglyphs on it instead of Mayan.</td></tr>
