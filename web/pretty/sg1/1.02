TEASER

LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Five airmen are sitting on duty around a table at
     the bottom of the ramp, playing poker.

  AIRMAN 1
     Oh man, this hand's as lousy as this detail. All
     right, everybody, ante up. (looking to female
     airman) That's you too. (he deals) Seven to the
     deuce, nothing there. Boss and the eight, nothing
     happening. Queen to the king, possible straight
     going there. Eight on the eight, and the jack gets
     a boss. Eights open.

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     Aren't you guys afraid of an officer coming down
     here or something?

  AIRMAN 2
     Trust me, nobody ever comes down here but us.

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     (looking to the slightly billowing Stargate cover)
     Does that thing always do that?

  AIRMAN 1
     Do what?

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     Whatever it is under the tarp, I just...saw it
     move or do something.

  AIRMAN 2
     Probably the only thing it ever did was cost
     money.

  AIRMAN 1
     Yeah, and it looks like they ran out of that.
     They've been shipping personnel out of here for
     months.

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     (seeing tarp move again) I'm telling you, the
     thing is moving!

  AIRMAN 2
     If you don't have the straight, just fold.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up from her seat and makes towards the
     covered item.

  AIRMAN 1
     (agitated) Can we take that as a fold?

  AIRMAN 2
     Just finish the hand, she's out.

  ANNOTATION
     The female airman approaches the tarp and starts
     up the ramp. It starts shaking suddenly, they hear
     a rumbling sound, and she backs away down the ramp
     as it shakes along with the table where the other
     airmen are seated. The jump to their feet, hands
     to their guns.

  AIRMAN 3
     What the...?

  ANNOTATION
     The tarp flies from the device and reveals the
     Stargate spinning and active.

  AIRMAN 3
     Whoa!

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     I take it this has never happened before?

  ANNOTATION
     Airman 2 goes to the red phone on the wall as the
     other stand ready at the base of the ramp. The
     Stargate activates--the kawhoosh expands outwards
     and, he drops the phone. The others fall to the
     ground as the event horizon billows out towards
     them. Airman 1 passes out guns, and they ready
     them, standing and waiting in front of the
     Stargate. The female airman starts up the ramp.

  AIRMAN 1
     What are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     As she reaches the Stargate, a ball drops through
     it to her feet, glows, and seems to scan her
     bodily. It falls still, and she bends down to
     touch it.

  AIRMAN 3
     What are you doing?

  AIRMAN 1
     Don't touch it!

  ANNOTATION
     She picks it up, looking back to them in
     confusion. Then a serpent guard steps through the
     wormhole right on top of her, taking a hold of her
     round the neck and taking her gun. The other
     airmen aim their guns.

  AIRMAN 1
     Hold your fire!

  ANNOTATION
     More serpent guards come through the Stargate.

  AIRMAN 1
     Identi...Hold it...Identify yourself!

  ANNOTATION
     The last figure steps through the Stargate, his
     armour made of gold. He stands in front of his
     seven guards and reveals his face--a human face.

  APOPHIS
     (in echoing voice) Jaffa! Kree!

  ANNOTATION
     The guard holding the female airman reveals his
     face, and Apophis turns to him.

  APOPHIS
     Teal'c, kree!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c studies the female airman's gun, then drops
     it and passes the woman roughly to Apophis.

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     Get your hands off me!

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis brings his hand up and a device emits a
     glow that latches on to her face, she becomes
     calm.

  AIRMAN 1
     Let her go!

  ANNOTATION
     One of the serpent guards fires with his staff
     weapon, and a fire fight ensues. Teal'c covers the
     female airman with his body as the bullets bounce
     off the Goa'uld armour. Apophis sees one of his
     guards go down. One of the airmen is hit, and he
     crashes into the card table.

  APOPHIS
     Kree! Jaffa!

  ANNOTATION
     He waves them back.

  AIRMAN 2
     (into the phone) We're under fire down here. We
     need...

  ANNOTATION
     He is hit by a staff blast and goes down. Airmen 1
     continues firing until he too is finally struck.
     The base alarms have started sounding.

  APOPHIS
     Teal'c. A'la spree.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks towards the Stargate.


LOCATION--BASE CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Airmen are running for the gate room.

  SF
     Go, go!

  ANNOTATION
     The Mountain doors close.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     General Hammond and the airmen stream in and take
     position. All but Apophis, the female airman and
     two of his guards are gone. One picks up the
     scanning device. The airmen cock their guns.

  HAMMOND
     Hold your fire!

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis's eyes glow, his helmet goes up, and they
     retreat through the Stargate. It dissipates.

  END OF TEASER



LOCATION--OUTSIDE O'NEILL'S HOUSE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Major Samuels gets out of his car and walks
     towards the house, he knocks on the door. An
     airman accompanying him moves round to the side of
     the house.

  AIRMAN
     Sir, there's a ladder over here.

  ANNOTATION
     They climb up to where O'Neill has his eye to a
     telescope pointing to the sky.

  SAMUELS
     Colonel Jack O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     (not looking at him) Retired.

  SAMUELS
     I'm Major Samuels.

  O'NEILL
     Air Force?

  SAMUELS
     Yes, sir, I'm the General's Executive Officer.

  O'NEILL
     Want a little piece of advice, Major? Get re-assed
     to NASA. That's where all the action's gonna be.
     Out there.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill continues looking at a galaxy formation
     through the telescope.

  SAMUELS
     I'm uh, I'm under orders to bring you to see
     General Hammond, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Never heard of him.

  SAMUELS
     He replaced General West. He says it's important.
     Has to do with the Stargate.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill finally looks around, interested.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN BASE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     A car enters the base.


LOCATION--ELEVATOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, dressed in casual clothes, is accompanied
     by an officer down to Sublevel 11. They walk down
     the corridor.

  INTERCOM
     Tag team number nine to Sublevel Two, Vent Shaft
     Twenty-Four.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill signs in at the desk, and they head for a
     second elevator.

  OFFICER
     We have to take a second elevator the rest of the
     way, sir, it's a long way down.

  O'NEILL
     (entering the elevator) Yeah I know. I've been
     here before.

  OFFICER
     Ah, of course.

  ANNOTATION
     The elevator descends, and they get out. Samuels
     is at the end of the corridor. He motions O'Neill
     towards a door.

  SAMUELS
     This way, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Samuels follows O'Neill, and the officer takes
     Samuels's position.


LOCATION--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     There are two knocks on the door.

  HAMMOND
     Come.

  ANNOTATION
     Samuels and O'Neill enter.

  SAMUELS
     General Hammond, Colonel Jack O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Retired.

  HAMMOND
     I can see that. Me, I'm on my last tour. Time to
     start getting my thoughts together, maybe write a
     book. You ever think of writing a book on your
     exploits in the line of duty?

  O'NEILL
     I've thought about it, but then I'd have to shoot
     anyone that actually read it. (getting no
     response) That's a joke, sir. Most of my work the
     last ten years was classified.

  HAMMOND
     Yes, of course.

  O'NEILL
     Major Samuels mentioned something about the
     Stargate?

  HAMMOND
     Down to business, I can do that. (standing) This
     way.

  ANNOTATION
     They all leave the office.


LOCATION--LAB

  ANNOTATION
     A doctor pulls back a sheet from dead Jaffa's
     face.

  HAMMOND
     Anyone you know, Colonel?

  DOCTOR
     They're not human.

  O'NEILL
     Ya think?

  DOCTOR
     Best we can tell, these slits are actually a
     pouch, similar to that found in a marsupial.

  SAMUELS
     Like a kangaroo.

  DOCTOR
     We haven't done an autopsy yet.

  HAMMOND
     These people--or aliens--or whatever you want to
     call them...came through...killed four of my
     people and kidnapped another using advanced
     weapons.

  O'NEILL
     Weapons, sir?

  ANNOTATION
     An airman brings forwards a staff weapon and
     Hammond hands it to O'Neill.

  SAMUELS
     We can't figure out how they operate.

  ANNOTATION
     With confidence, O'Neill activates and then
     deactivates the weapon.

  HAMMOND
     Seen one before, I take it?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir. (hands the weapon back) But there are no
     creatures like this on Abydos. Those people were
     human. They were from Earth. Ra brought 'em there
     thousands of years ago.

  HAMMOND
     I know all about that. But your report said this
     Ra was in fact some kind of alien that lived
     inside a human body.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, his eyes glowed. That was our first clue.

  HAMMOND
     Are you sure he's dead, Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     Unless he could survive a tactical nuclear warhead
     blowing up in his face, I'm positive. Why?

  HAMMOND
     These "people", or whatever they are, were
     guarding another man who retreated back through
     the Stargate. I got a good look at his eyes,
     Colonel. They glowed.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks shocked.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, O'Neill and Samuels are walking.

  HAMMOND
     How do you feel about the Stargate mission after
     all this time, Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     How do you mean?

  HAMMOND
     Well, it's been over a year. Has your perspective
     changed?

  O'NEILL
     Well, sir I...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill's voice trails off as he notes Ferretti
     and Kawalsky being led through another door.


LOCATION--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  O'NEILL
     Was that...?

  HAMMOND
     Kawalsky and Ferretti yes, they were under your
     command on the first Stargate mission. Tell me
     about Daniel Jackson, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Through the window in Hammond's office, O'Neill
     watches Kawalsky and Ferretti in the briefing
     room.

  O'NEILL
     Why are they questioning my men?

  HAMMOND
     They're not your men anymore, Colonel--you
     retired. Daniel Jackson?

  O'NEILL
     You read the report?

  HAMMOND
     Yes.

  O'NEILL
     It's all there.

  SAMUELS
     Is it?

  O'NEILL
     What's this all about, General?

  HAMMOND
     You didn't like Daniel Jackson, did you?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel was a scientist. He sneezed a lot.
     Basically he was a geek, sir.

  SAMUELS
     So you didn't have a lot of time for him.

  O'NEILL
     I didn't say that. He also saved my life and found
     the way home for my men and me--a little thing
     like that kinda makes a person grow on ya. Know
     what I mean?

  HAMMOND
     According to the mission brief, your orders were
     to go through the Stargate, detect any possible
     threat to earth, and, if found, to detonate a
     nuclear device and destroy the 'gate on the other
     side.

  O'NEILL
     Yes.

  SAMUELS
     But that's not what you did, is it?

  O'NEILL
     Not right away. Ra's forces overpowered my team
     and took the weapon before I could arm it.

  SAMUELS
     But with Doctor Jackson's help you eventually
     regained control and did in fact detonate the
     weapon. Yes?

  O'NEILL
     Yes.

  HAMMOND
     To the best of your knowledge, Daniel Jackson and
     everyone else you knew on Abydos is dead, correct?

  O'NEILL
     (pausing slightly) That's correct.

  HAMMOND
     Good. (standing) Then you won't mind if I
     authorize a go ahead on our plan.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the office.

  HAMMOND
     This quartz material the Stargates are made of--it
     must be tough stuff if it can withstand a Mark
     III.

  O'NEILL
     Well, we sent a robot probe through after we got
     back, sir. It was flattened on the other end.
     Obviously, the Abydos Stargate had been buried in
     the rubble.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the gate room.

  HAMMOND
     Well, somehow it got unburied.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     There is a bomb being prepped at the bottom of the
     Stargate ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Oh my God. You're sending another bomb?

  HAMMOND
     Mark V this time. If these creatures did reopen
     the Abydos Gate, we intend to reseal it for good.

  O'NEILL
     General, you can't do that.

  HAMMOND
     Countdown's already started...Unless you have
     something to add.

  O'NEILL
     (after a long pause) General Hammond? Sir? I
     regret to inform you that my report was not
     entirely accurate.

  HAMMOND
     You didn't detonate the bomb.

  O'NEILL
     No, I did detonate the bomb, sir, and it was
     aboard Ra's spacecraft, so it did kill him and
     eliminate the risk to Earth.

  SAMUELS
     However?

  O'NEILL
     However...Ra's ship was in orbit above the planet
     at the time. Neither the 'gate nor anything else
     on the planet was destroyed. Daniel Jackson is
     alive and living with the people on Abydos.

  HAMMOND
     You violated direct orders! Why?

  O'NEILL
     Because the people of Abydos are no threat to us!
     They deserve to be left alone.

  HAMMOND
     That's not up to you!

  O'NEILL
     With all due respect, sir--if I'd come back here
     and reported the 'gate on the other side was still
     intact, we would have sent another bomb, just like
     you were about to. It wasn't necessary to let
     those people die. The threat from Ra was gone.

  SAMUELS
     What about the probe we sent through? It was
     crushed instantly.

  O'NEILL
     After we came home, Daniel buried the 'gate in
     rocks, making my return or anybody else's
     impossible.

  HAMMOND
     Well, those four bodies lying in the infirmary say
     otherwise, Airman.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sighs. Hammond studies him for a moment,
     then turns to the bomb technicians.

  HAMMOND
     We'll send the bomb through on schedule.

  O'NEILL
     General, you can't do that!

  HAMMOND
     Oh, I can't?

  O'NEILL
     There are innocent people on that planet!

  HAMMOND
     There are innocent people here! I have my orders
     too, Colonel. I obey mine. Take Colonel O'Neill to
     the holding room. Let's give him some time to
     think about things while I decide what to do with
     him.

  SAMUELS
     (to guards in room) Sergeant...

  ANNOTATION
     After Hammond and Samuels leave, two airmen flank
     O'Neill. He walks off between them.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT


LOCATION--HOLDING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is led inside and the door is shut.
     Kawalsky rises from one of the bunks and salutes
     crisply.

  KAWALSKY
     Colonel O'Neill, sir.

  O'NEILL
     I'm retired, Kawalsky. Lose the salute.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky drops his hand and shakes O'Neill's hand,
     smiling.

  KAWALSKY
     Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.

  O'NEILL
     I appreciate that.

  KAWALSKY
     Hey those kids on Abydos saved my life too.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, the kids.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit at a table and chairs.

  KAWALSKY
     They're the whole reason they kept the secret,
     right?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pats Kawalsky reassuringly on the arm.

  KAWALSKY
     That one kid idolized you, remember him? Weird
     name...what was it?

  O'NEILL
     Skaara.

  KAWALSKY
     Right. Remember how he was always saluting you?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, my kid used to do that when he was little.
     Skaara kinda reminded me of him.

  KAWALSKY
     Oh man, Colonel, you and me went through that
     whole mission together. I never even knew you had
     a son.

  O'NEILL
     Well, he died. Just before the Abydos mission.

  KAWALSKY
     I'm sorry, sir, I had no idea.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, and they stand as Hammond walks
     in.

  HAMMOND
     How many people did you say are on Abydos?

  O'NEILL
     That we saw? Maybe five thousand.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks down, deep in thought. Kawalsky and
     O'Neill exchange looks.

  O'NEILL
     Does this mean you're reconsidering sending the
     bomb, sir?

  HAMMOND
     It means I'm open to suggestions.

  O'NEILL
     General, let me take a team through that 'gate.
     We'll find out who those aliens are. Kawalsky and
     I have been there before. We know the lay of the
     land. We know the people.

  HAMMOND
     You think you do. Daniel could be dead. You don't
     know what you'd be walking into.

  O'NEILL
     Sir, there is one way to find out.

  HAMMOND
     Right. We'll have the prototype probe shipped from
     MIT.

  O'NEILL
     General, we don't need that probe.

  KAWALSKY
     We don't?

  O'NEILL
     No. (grabs the tissue box from the table) This'll
     do.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves the holding room, and Kawalsky and
     Hammond follow.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Airmen surround the 'gate, guns ready as the
     Stargate dials.

LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Hammond, Samuels and Kawalsky are in the
     control room. O'Neill still holds the tissue box
     in his hands.

  HAMMOND
     Care to explain this concept?

  TECHNICIAN
     Chevron Five encoded.

  O'NEILL
     Jackson has allergies.

  KAWALSKY
     (grinning suddenly) Oh, I get it.

  O'NEILL
     He'll know this came from me and not from someone,
     with all due respect, sir, like yourself.

  SCIENTIST
     Optimum level.

     and tosses the tissue box through.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  TECHNICIAN
     The, um, object should reach final destination in
     five seconds, four, three, two, one.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate deactivates.

  TECHNICIAN
     The object should now be through the Abydos
     Stargate.

  HAMMOND
     Now what?

  O'NEILL
     (reentering the control room) Now we wait. If
     Daniel's still around, he'll know what the message
     means.

  SAMUELS
     What if the aliens get it?

  O'NEILL
     Well, they could be blowing their noses right now.

  SAMUELS
     They could be planning an attack!

  O'NEILL
     Aw, come on, Samuels, let me be the cynic around
     here, okay? (to Hammond) Sir, this could take some
     time.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the control room.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM, SOME TIME LATER

  ANNOTATION
     They are all waiting when the Stargate rumbles to
     life.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, Samuels, Kawalsky and O'Neill enter and
     watch as the tissue box flies back through the
     Stargate, and the 'gate event horizon dissipates.
     O'Neill picks up the box, and smiles. He hands it
     to Samuels, and he and Hammond see that written on
     its side are the words: "THANKS, SEND MORE."

  O'NEILL
     Permission to take a team through the Stargate,
     sir?

  HAMMOND
     Assuming I get the President's authorization. The
     mission briefing will be at 0800 hours. Consider
     yourself recalled to active duty, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Samuels leave. O'Neill and Kawalsky
     smile and shake hands before following.

     Hammond straightens some papers on his desk, then
     moves to the briefing room.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond enters the room. Samuels, Kawalsky,
     Ferretti, and O'Neill, all in class A uniform, are
     already there along with other officers.

  SAMUELS
     Ten hut.

  ANNOTATION
     The occupants, including O'Neill, salute.

  HAMMOND
     Gentlemen, take your seats.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven occupants of the room sit at the table,
     O'Neill remains standing by his chair.

  HAMMOND
     Where's Captain Carter?

  SAMUELS
     Just arriving, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  HAMMOND
     I'm assigning Sam Carter to this mission.

  O'NEILL
     I'd prefer to put together my own team, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Not on this mission, sorry. Carter's our expert on
     the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     Where's he transferring from?

  CARTER
     She is transferring from the Pentagon.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters the room, and moves to her seat at
     the table.

  CARTER
     I take it you're Colonel O'Neill. (she salutes)
     Captain Samantha Carter reporting, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill salutes back.

  KAWALSKY
     (smirking) But of course you go by "Sam".

  CARTER
     (returning his expression) You don't have to
     worry, Major. I played with dolls when I was a
     kid.

  KAWALSKY
     G.I. Joe?

  CARTER
     No, Major Matt Mason.

  KAWALSKY
     Oh... (to Ferretti) Who?

  FERRETTI
     Major Matt Mason, astronaut doll. Did you have
     that cool little backpack that made him fly?

  HAMMOND
     Let's get started. Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     Thank you. (Carter sits) Those of you on your
     first trip through the 'gate, you should be
     prepared for what to expect.

  CARTER
     I've practically memorized your report from the
     first mission. I'd like to think I've been
     preparing for this my whole life.

  KAWALSKY
     I think what the Colonel is saying is, have you
     ever pulled out of a simulated bombing run in an
     F-16 at 8-plus G's?

  CARTER
     Yes.

  KAWALSKY
     (surprised) Well, it's way worse than that.

  FERRETTI
     By the time you get to the other side, you're
     frozen stiff, like you've just been through a
     blizzard, naked.

  ANNOTATION
     He and Kawalsky grin at each other.

  CARTER
     That's a result of the compression your molecules
     undergo during the millisecond required for
     reconstitution.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, here we go. Another scientist. General,
     please.

  CARTER
     Theoretical astrophysicist.

  O'NEILL
     Which means?

  HAMMOND
     Which means she is smarter than you are, Colonel.
     Especially in matters related to the Stargate.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky and Ferretti are sniggering, O'Neill
     looks over to them, and they stop abruptly.

  CARTER
     Colonel, I was studying the 'gate technology for
     two years before Daniel Jackson made it work and
     before you both went through. I should have gone
     through then. But, sir, you and your men might as
     well accept the fact that I am going through this
     time.

  O'NEILL
     Well with all due respect, Doctor, I...

  CARTER
     It is appropriate to refer to a person by their
     rank, not their salutation. You should call me
     "captain", not "doctor".

  HAMMOND
     Captain Carter's assignment to this unit is not an
     option, it's an order.

  CARTER
     I'm an Air Force officer just like you are,
     Colonel, and just because my reproductive organs
     are on the inside instead of the outside, doesn't
     mean I can't handle whatever you can handle.

  O'NEILL
     (smiling and sitting) Oh, this has nothing to do
     with you being a woman. I like women. I just have
     a little problem with scientists.

  CARTER
     Colonel, I logged over a hundred hours in enemy
     airspace during the Gulf War. Is that tough enough
     for you? Or are we going to have to arm wrestle?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill raises his eyebrows in amusement.

  SAMUELS
     I hate to throw a damper on your enthusiasm, but I
     still say the safest, most logical way to deal
     with this is to bury the Stargate, just like the
     ancient Egyptians did, and make it impossible for
     the aliens to return. It's the only way to
     eliminate the threat.

  O'NEILL
     Except it won't work.

  HAMMOND
     It worked before.

  O'NEILL
     They know what we are now. They know how far we've
     come. We're a threat to them. They've got ships,
     General. Ra had one as big as the great pyramids.
     They don't need the Stargate to get here. They can
     do it the old fashioned way. Now with all due
     respect to Mister Glass-is-half-empty over here,
     don't you think maybe we should use the Stargate
     to do a little reconnaissance before they decide
     to come back...again?

  HAMMOND
     I'll give you exactly twenty-four hours to either
     return or send a message through. No Kleenex boxes
     please. Otherwise, we'll assume the worst and send
     a bomb through.

  O'NEILL
     Understood.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates. The Colonel, his team, and
     Hammond enter the room.

  HAMMOND
     Try to follow orders this time, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Sir?

  HAMMOND
     This time you bring Daniel Jackson back. Is that
     clear?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They salute.

  O'NEILL
     Move out.

  ANNOTATION
     His team walks through the Stargate, leaving
     Carter and O'Neill at the base of the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Captain?

  CARTER
     Oh, don't worry, Colonel. I won't let you down.

  O'NEILL
     Good. I was going to say "ladies first."

  ANNOTATION
     They walk to the event horizon.

  CARTER
     You know, you really will like me when you get to
     know me.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, I adore you already, Captain.

  CARTER
     (staring at the even horizon up close) My God.
     Look at this! I mean, the energy the 'gate must
     release to create a stable wormhole is...it's
     astronomical to use exactly the right word! (She
     touches it, and it ripples.) You can actually see
     the fluctuation in the event horizon!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shoves her through the 'gate, then walks
     through after her.

  WORMHOLE EFFECT



LOCATION--ABYDOS STARGATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill emerges through the 'gate, and it
     dissipates behind him. His team are there getting
     ready. He approaches Carter, who is hunched over.

  CARTER
     Ugh. I think I'm going to be sick, ugh.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe you shouldn't have had that big lunch, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     They all move out into the apparently empty room
     when suddenly natives emerge from the shadows and
     point guns at them. They cock their own guns--at a
     stand off. Then Daniel pops up.

  DANIEL
     Cha'hali! Cha'hali. Lower your guns.

  ANNOTATION
     The natives lower their weapons and relax.

  DANIEL
     Hello, Jack. Welcome back.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks towards him and then barges past to
     get to Skaara who stands behind him. Skaara
     salutes, and O'Neill returns it with a smile, then
     they hug with a laugh.

  O'NEILL
     Skaara!

  SKAARA
     O'Neill! I did not think to be seeing you again!

  O'NEILL
     (turns to Daniel) Daniel, how you doing?

  DANIEL
     Uh, good, you?

  O'NEILL
     Much better, now that I see everyone's okay.

  FERRETTI
     (making the "live long and prosper" sign)
     Greetings from Earth, Doctor Jackson.

  DANIEL
     (smiling) Hello, Ferretti.

  KAWALSKY
     Brought you a little something, Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands Daniel a pocket pack of tissues.

  DANIEL
     Kawalsky.

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're emerges slightly at the side of the room.
     Daniel beckons to her.

  DANIEL
     Sha're, don't be shy.

  ANNOTATION
     She joins him, and they stand together.

  O'NEILL
     Hi. (he holds out a hand to her) Good to see you
     again.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands.

  DANIEL
     So, I figure it was only a matter of time before
     you had to tell the truth about us still being
     here.

  O'NEILL
     Yep. Why the militia? Has something else come
     through?

  DANIEL
     No, just taking precautions, why?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter interrupts unwittingly, studying the DHD.

  CARTER
     Amazing. This is what was missing from the dig at
     Giza. This is how they controlled it! It took us
     fifteen years and three supercomputers to MacGyver
     a system on Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gives O'Neill a questioning look. O'Neill
     shrugs.

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Captain?

  CARTER
     (oblivious) Look how small it is!

  O'NEILL
     Captain!

  ANNOTATION
     She finally turns around. He gestures to Daniel.

  CARTER
     Oh right, excuse me. Doctor Jackson, I presume.
     I'm Doctor Samantha Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel shake hands.

  O'NEILL
     I thought you wanted to be called "captain"?

  DANIEL
     What's going on, Jack?

  O'NEILL
     Six hostile aliens came through the Stargate on
     Earth. Four people are dead, one's missing.

  KAWALSKY
     One of them looked like Ra, Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Well, they didn't come from here. I mean the boys
     take shifts guarding it 36 hours a day, every day.
     We'd know if they came through here.

  O'NEILL
     Well they came from somewhere, Daniel. I'm gonna
     have to look around.

  DANIEL
     All right. I think I can help you find out who it
     was, but, uh, it's going to have to wait until
     this sandstorm is over. Uh, we were about to have
     our evening meal. Why don't you join us?


LOCATION--ABYDOS STARGATE ROOM, SOME TIME LATER

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, his team, Daniel and many Abydonians are
     gathered in a circle on the floor, eating.

  DANIEL
     Benna wah. Everybody try this.

  SKAARA
     This too.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands out bowls of liquid, one to O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     What's this?

  SKAARA
     Drink.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands him a bowl. O'Neill sniffs it.

  O'NEILL
     Moonshine?

  SKAARA
     Moon...shine?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, moonshine, as in booze, er...Daniel, what
     are you teaching these kids?

  SKAARA
     (smiling) Try it.

  O'NEILL
     All right. Skaara's moonshine. I'll give it a
     little shot. (he drinks, then spits it out
     suddenly) Oh...God!

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone laughs.

  O'NEILL
     (rasps) Smooth, very smooth.

  SKAARA
     Moonshine!

  KAWALSKY
     Your little soldiers are all grown up, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I'm so proud. Whoa...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hands the bowl off to Carter.

  SKAARA
     O'Neill...your lighter?

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out the lighter.

  O'NEILL
     No, it's yours, I gave that to you to keep.
     Remember?

  SKAARA
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  DANIEL
     You know he's never had that out of his sight the
     whole time you were gone.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah?

  DANIEL
     So this...this man who looked like Ra, he must
     have come through another 'gate.

  CARTER
     What other 'gate?

  O'NEILL
     Another Stargate?

  CARTER
     The Stargate only goes here.

  DANIEL
     No, no, I think you're wrong about that.

  CARTER
     I was there, we ran hundreds of permutations.

  DANIEL
     But you didn't have what you need.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel what are you talking about?

  SKAARA
     Daniel, the storm has passed.

  DANIEL
     I'll show you. Sha're, ben quar ri, Jack and his
     friends need to see the vili tao an.

  SHA'RE
     Bonni wai?

  DANIEL
     I won't be long.

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're kisses him passionately, and everyone
     whoops and laughs, O'Neill giving him a weird
     look.

  SHA'RE
     Goodbye, my Daniel.

  DANIEL
     (stunned) Goodbye.

  KAWALSKY
     Ferretti, hold the fort.

  FERRETTI
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--OUTSIDE THE PYRAMID, ABYDOS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky, O'Neill, Carter and Daniel emerge into
     the bright desert.

  KAWALSKY
     Boy, I can't say I've missed this place.

  DANIEL
     Come on.

  CARTER
     This is just incredible.


LOCATION--CAVERN

  ANNOTATION
     Torches light a tunnel leading inside the pyramid.

  DANIEL
     So, I figured there had to be more to this place.
     So I started exploring, just the area around the
     town and the pyramid at first. Then after about a
     month, I found this place. Uh, Captain Doctor,
     you're going to love this.

  ANNOTATION
     Torches light up a big room with elaborate drawing
     on the walls.

  CARTER
     Oh my God. This is amazing. This is the
     archaeological find of the century.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you had a chance to translate this yet?

  DANIEL
     I think so.

  O'NEILL
     What does it say?

  DANIEL
     Well, uh, it doesn't say anything. Actually it's
     sort of a chart, more of a...map.

  O'NEILL
     Of?

  DANIEL
     Well I haven't been able to analyze all of it, I
     mean look at it. It would take my whole life.

  O'NEILL
     Well, Daniel, we don't have that long. What's it a
     map of?

  DANIEL
     Well, the cartouches seem to be separated clearly
     into groupings. Each grouping is attached to the
     others with a series of lines. And each grouping
     of glyphs contain seven symbols. So you can see
     where this is going, of course.

  O'NEILL
     Tell us anyway.

  DANIEL
     All of the symbols are on the Stargate in the
     Abydos chamber. I've also managed to chart some of
     them in the Abydos night sky, or at least pretty
     close. Jack, I think that this is a map of a vast
     network of Stargates--Stargates that are...are all
     over the galaxy.

  CARTER
     Uh, I don't think that can be, Doctor.

  DANIEL
     Why not?

  CARTER
     Well, because after Colonel O'Neill and his team
     came back, my team tried hundreds of symbol
     permutations using Earth as the point of origin,
     and it never worked.

  DANIEL
     I tried the same here, and it didn't work either.
     But I figured the destinations I tried were either
     destroyed or buried. But, um, I mean some of them
     somewhere must still exist.

  CARTER
     I don't think so.

  CARTER
     Then where did your Ra lookalike come from?

  CARTER
     Uh...

  DANIEL
     Look I don't pretend to know anything about
     astrophysics but couldn't the planets change? I
     mean, uh, drift apart or something like that, to
     throw this map off?

  CARTER
     I knew I'd like you.

  DANIEL
     You mean I'm right?

  CARTER
     According to the expanding universe model ,all
     bodies in the universe are constantly moving
     further apart...

  DANIEL
     So in the thousands of years since the Stargate
     was built...

  CARTER
     All the coordinates could have changed.

  DANIEL
     But why does it still work between Abydos and
     Earth?

  CARTER
     Abydos is probably the closest planet in the
     network to Earth. I mean the closer they are, the
     less the difference in relative position due to
     expansion--the further away, the greater the
     difference. In a few thousand more years, it won't
     work between Earth and Abydos either.

  DANIEL
     Unless you can adjust for the displacement.

  CARTER
     Right, now with this map as a base, that should be
     easy. All we have to do is correct for Doppler's
     Shift. Then I should be able to arrive at a
     computer model that can predict the adjustments
     necessary to get the 'gate working again.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky and O'Neill exchange looks.

  KAWALSKY
     Okay, so what did we just figure out?

  CARTER
     Any civilization advanced enough to build this
     'gate network would be able to compensate for
     50,000 years of stellar drift.

  O'NEILL
     So...the Stargate can go other places?

  CARTER
     The aliens could have come from anywhere.


LOCATION--ABYDOS STARGATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Abydonians are talking and laughing with the
     team and Ferretti. They watch Sha're walk past
     them.

  FERRETTI
     Man, you got to give Daniel credit. She is one
     beautiful woman.

  ANNOTATION
     They turn as the Stargate starts to dial in.

  AIRMAN
     We got company, boys! Move, move! Everybody take
     cover!

  ANNOTATION
     They scatter to the edges of the room, hiding
     behind the pillars, holding their guns ready as
     the Stargate opens. Goa'uld guards walk through
     and start firing immediately, hitting a few
     Abyodonians. They fire back, as do the SG team.
     The Goa'uld have the upper hand quickly and
     Apophis looks on as they shoot the SG team down.
     Skaara sees Sha're and fires at the Goa'uld.

  SKAARA
     Sha're, shim rota! Shim rota!

  ANNOTATION
     They seize her. She screams, and Skaara steps
     forward but finds his gun jammed. He tries to
     fight but is grabbed by Teal'c.

  SHA'RE
     No! Skaara!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c's helmet opens to reveal his face to Skaara
     as he holds him. Meanwhile Sha're still fights
     with another guard.

  SHA'RE
     No! No! Skaara!

  TEAL'C
     This is not your weapon. Where did you get it?

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara spits in his face. Teal'c brings him to
     Apophis, who lowers his helmet.

  APOPHIS
     Good choice, Teal'c. A perfect specimen.

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis raises his hand device and knocks Skaara
     out with it.

  SHA'RE
     No! No! Stop it! Stop it! Skaara! Skaara!

  ANNOTATION
     She is taken to Apophis. He studies her face.

  APOPHIS
     You may be the one.

  ANNOTATION
     He knocks her out with the hand device. A guard
     dials the Stargate. Ferretti, injured and barely
     conscious, watches the dialling. They leave
     through the 'gate with Sha're and Skaara. The
     wormhole deactivates. Abydonians emerge as Daniel
     and the other return.

  DANIEL
     Sha're! (he moves to an injured Abydonian)
     Bolaa...

  BOLAA
     There's so...there's so many...

  DANIEL
     What?

  BOLAA
     So many of them...

  DANIEL
     It's all right. Just tell me what happened.

  BOLAA
     It was Ra...

  O'NEILL
     What's going on?

  DANIEL
     Ra is dead. Tao qua Ra.

  BOLAA
     No...Ra. I saw...he took Sha're, he took
     Skaara...into the Chaapa'ai.

  DANIEL
     Where, did you see? Did you see?

  ANNOTATION
     Bolaa's eyes close slowly, and he dies.

  KAWALSKY
     What's going on, Daniel? Could there be another
     Ra?

  DANIEL
     How in the hell should I know? I should have left
     the barricade up. This my fault.

  O'NEILL
     (holding a hand to a fallen soldiers neck) Come
     on, come on.

  CARTER
     (At Ferretti's side) Colonel Ferretti needs
     medical attention now!

  DANIEL
     Go, help him, I can send you back.

  O'NEILL
     You're coming with us this time, Daniel. I've got
     orders.

  DANIEL
     (laughs) I don't care about your orders, Colonel.
     My wife is out there. So is Skaara.

  O'NEILL
     And the only way we're going to get 'em back is
     for you to come home with us. Ferretti might have
     seen those coordinates. Captain, do you have the
     video?

  ANNOTATION
     She holds up her camcorder.

  CARTER
     I've got everything I need.

  FERRETTI
     (weak) Too many...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks around to his friends, some dying,
     some grieving.

  DANIEL
     (gesturing for them to draw near) Ni-ya. Ni-ya.
     (they gather around him) After we go through the
     Chappa'ai, you have to bury it like we did before
     and then leave this place.

  ABYDONIAN
     You come back?

  DANIEL
     No, I can't. Nobody can. That's what I'm telling
     you. Not for a...long time. Now as soon as we're
     gone, I want you to close it, bury it, put a big,
     heavy cover stone over it--nothing good can ever
     come through this 'gate. Do you understand me?

  ABYDONIAN
     You came through, Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Do you remember the story I told you? How the
     ancient Egyptians back on Earth cut themselves off
     from Ra? Well that is exactly what you have to do.
     Then in one year...one year from this day you take
     the cover stone away. I will try to bring Sha're
     home with me on that day. But if I don't make it
     back, if I don't return then you must bury the
     'gate again forever, joa qua? You tell Sha're's
     father--in one year.

  ANNOTATION
     His voice breaks, and they all hug him, saying
     goodbye. Then he beaks free and starts to dial out
     on the DHD.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate spins.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over intercom) Stand by for arrival, stand by for
     arrival.

  ANNOTATION
     The blast doors close and soldiers gather at the
     ramp base as the wormhole forms. The team bursts
     through, O'Neill and Carter dragging Ferretti, and
     others dragging another wounded team member.
     Samuels and Hammond enter.

  KAWALSKY
     Get the medic!

  SAMUELS
     (into his radio) Close the iris! Close the iris!

  ANNOTATION
     The metal iris closes on the Stargate, and O'Neill
     spins round in surprise, his gun ready.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over intercom) Wormhole disengaged.

  O'NEILL
     (to Hammond) What the hell's that, sir?

  HAMMOND
     That's our insurance against any more surprises.
     It's pure titanium, hopefully impenetrable.

  ANNOTATION
     He watches as the medics put Ferretti onto a
     stretcher.

  MEDIC
     Get the gauze on him. We've got to stop the
     bleeding from his leg.

  HAMMOND
     (to O'Neill) What happened, Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     Base camp was hit while we were on recon, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Same hostiles who attacked us?

  O'NEILL
     That's a fair guess. Jackson's wife and one of our
     kids was kidnapped.

  HAMMOND
     (puzzled) Your kids?

  O'NEILL
     From the previous mission, sir.

  DANIEL
     General, hi. I'm Daniel Jackson, we've never met,
     uhm, I'd like to be on the team that goes after
     them.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out his hand to shake Hammond's. Hammond
     only glares at him.

  HAMMOND
     You're not in any position to make demands,
     Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     He moves up the ramp to see to the wounded.

  SKAARA
     Na ne!

  SHA'RE
     No! No! Skaara!

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're is seized and Skaara stopped by staff
     weapons held to his head.

  TEAL'C
     Your death cannot help her.

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're is carried off and the guards leave.

  SHA'RE

     They close the doors behind them, and Skaara runs
     for the doors, throwing himself against them.

     O'Neill, in casual civilian clothes, approaches
     Ferretti's bed where Kawalsky is sitting holding a
     coffee. He looks tired.

  O'NEILL
     Doc says he's going to make it.

  KAWALSKY
     Yes, sir.

  O'NEILL
     You going to stay here all night?

  KAWALSKY
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks as if to leave, and then sees
     Daniel, leaning against a wall, looking a little
     lost. Daniel now wears an air force jump suit.

  O'NEILL
     Hey.

  DANIEL
     They don't know what to do with me. And I don't
     know what to do with myself.

  O'NEILL
     C'mon, let's get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks off, and Daniel follows.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill collects two beers from the fridge, takes
     them to the living room where Daniel is waiting.
     Daniel sneezes, using his handkerchief just in
     time.

  O'NEILL
     Nice catch.

  DANIEL
     Thank you, sorry. 'Gate travel always seems to
     make my allergies... (he blows his nose) Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes the beer.

  O'NEILL
     So, you were saying.

  DANIEL
     Anyway, um, as soon as you were gone, they
     realized they were free. I mean, Abydos was their
     world for the taking.

  O'NEILL
     Have a little party did ya?

  DANIEL
     Oh yeah, big, big party. They treated me like
     their savior, it was um...embarrassing.

  O'NEILL
     It's amazing you turned out so normal.

  DANIEL
     Well if it wasn't for Sha're I probably... (he
     pauses at her memory) She was the complete
     opposite of everyone else. (he sits) She
     practically fell on the floor laughing every time
     I tried to do some chore that they all took for
     granted. Like um, grinding yaphetta flour. I mean,
     have you ever tried to grind your own flour?

  O'NEILL
     I'm trying to kick the flour thing.

  DANIEL
     (laughs) This is going straight to my head. (takes
     another swig of beer) What time is it anyway? I
     must have 'gate lag or something.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, for crying out loud, you've had one beer.
     You're a cheaper date then my wife was.

  DANIEL
     Yes, when am I going to meet your wife?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, probably...uh, never. After I came back from
     Abydos the first time, she'd already left.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, so was I. I think in her heart she forgave
     me for what happened to our kid, she
     just...couldn't forget.

  DANIEL
     And what about you?

  O'NEILL
     I'm the opposite, I'll never forgive myself, but
     sometimes I can forget. Sometimes.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes another swig of beer. They sit in
     silence.


LOCATION--APOPHIS'S PALACE, A HOLDING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The female airman is now dressed in a dress and
     veil, sitting in a room full of similarly dressed
     women. Sha're is also there. Teal'c and some
     guards enter, he points to the airman.

  TEAL'C
     You.

  ANNOTATION
     His guards rush forward and pull her up.

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     Where are you taking me? I'm a sergeant in the
     U.S. Air Force. I demand to know where you're
     taking me! Let go!


LOCATION--IMPLANTATION CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and the guards drag the female airman into
     the room.

  FEMALE AIRMAN
     Let go of me! Where the hell are you taking me?

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis enters the room.

  APOPHIS
     Come. (They move her over to him) Lovely. Full of
     life. (He hypnotizes her with his hand device.)
     You could be the vessel for my future queen.

  ANNOTATION
     She is subdued, and they remove her clothes.
     Apophis looks her over.

  APOPHIS
     Yes. Very nice indeed. But I am not the one you
     must finally please.

  ANNOTATION
     They lay her out on the slab in the centre of the
     room and Apophis calls into the side of the room,
     behind a curtain.

  APOPHIS
     Yametha, re!

  ANNOTATION
     A female Jaffa comes over and stands over the
     airman. From the Jaffa priestess's pouch. a
     symbiote reaches out, as if looking over the
     airman.

  APOPHIS
     Does she please you, my love?

  ANNOTATION
     The symbiote retreats inside its pouch, and the
     priestess leaves. Apophis walks over,
     disappointed.

  APOPHIS
     A shame. (He reaches out and kills the soldier
     with his hand device.) Send another.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond enters the already half-full room. Samuels
     announces him.

  SAMUELS
     Ladies and gentlemen, General Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     People, what is spoken of in this room is
     classified as SCI top secret. Colonel, what do we
     know about these hostiles that we didn't
     yesterday?

  ANNOTATION
     They all sit.

  O'NEILL
     Not a hell of a lot, General. The Abydon boys who
     survived the attack on the base camp thought it
     was Ra.

  HAMMOND
     I thought he was dead, gentlemen. Which is it?

  DANIEL
     Oh he's dead, he's definitely dead, I mean
     uh...the bomb...he's got to be dead, right?

  HAMMOND
     Then who's coming through the Stargate?

  DANIEL
     Gods.

  HAMMOND
     What?

  DANIEL
     Not as in "God" god. Ra played a god, the sun god.
     He borrowed the religion and culture of the
     ancient Egyptians he brought through the 'gate and
     then he used it to enslave them. You see, he
     wanted the people of Abydos to believe he was the
     only one.

  CARTER
     So you're saying Ra's not the last of his race
     after all?

  KAWALSKY
     Maybe he's got a brother Ray!

  O'NEILL
     That's what we need.

  DANIEL
     Wait a minute. The legend goes Ra's race was
     dying, he survived by taking over the body of his
     human host, an Egyptian boy. But who's to say more
     of his kind couldn't do the same thing? I mean,
     this could have happened any time, anywhere
     there's a 'gate. I mean this could be happening
     right now.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel you've had the most experience of fighting
     this hostile, assuming you have to defend yourself
     in the field, are you up to it?

  O'NEILL
     We beat 'em once.

  HAMMOND
     I'll take that as a maybe. Captain Carter, you're
     confident that Stargate will take us where we want
     to go with this new information?

  CARTER
     Well, they're feeding the revised coordinates into
     the targeting computer right now. It'll take time
     to calculate but it should spit out two or three
     destinations a month.

  HAMMOND
     People, let's not fool ourselves here. This thing
     is both vast and dangerous, and we are so far over
     our heads we can barely see daylight. We would all
     be much better off if the Stargate had been left
     in the ground.

  CARTER
     With respect, sir, we can't bury our heads in the
     sand. I mean think of how much we could learn,
     think of what we could bring back.

  HAMMOND
     What you could bring back is precisely what I'm
     afraid of Captain. However the President of the
     United States happens to agree with you. In the
     event your theories pan out, he has ordered the
     formation of nine teams, whose duties will be to
     perform reconnaissance, determine threats and if
     possible to make peaceful contact with the peoples
     of these worlds. Now these teams will operate on a
     covert top secret basis. No one will know of their
     existence except the President and the Joint
     Chiefs. Colonel O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     Sir?

  HAMMOND
     Your team will be designated SG-1. The team will
     consist of yourself, Captain Carter...

  DANIEL
     And me?

  HAMMOND
     Doctor Jackson, we need you to work as a
     consultant with the other SG teams from here. Your
     expertise in ancient cultures and languages are
     far too valuable...

  DANIEL
     No. Um, look I, I mean I know this is your
     decision but I just...I...really have to be on
     their team. My wife is out there, General, I need
     to go.

  HAMMOND
     I'll take that under consideration. Major
     Kawalsky, you will head

  SG-2.


  KAWALSKY
     I will?

  HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill keeps telling me it's about time
     you had a command.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky looks over at O'Neill, who shrugs.

  O'NEILL
     I had a moment of weakness.

  ANNOTATION
     An airman enters and hands a note to Samuels.

  SAMUELS
     Ferretti's conscious, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaps up and leaves.

  HAMMOND
     Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     They all follow.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Ferretti is sitting kind of upright, still tubed
     and looking rough, with a laptop on the table over
     his bed. Carter moves to his side.

  CARTER
     (to nurse) I'll take over now. Thanks.

  O'NEILL
     Ferretti, I know you're probably not feeling so
     hot, but we need something from you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at what he's typing on the laptop
     screen.

  CARTER
     Look's like he's way ahead of you, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     They watch as he calls up seven 'gate symbols.

  O'NEILL
     You saw all seven symbols? This is where they
     went? You sure?

  FERRETTI
     Mmm...


LOCATION--CORRIDOR, LATER

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Samuels walks through the corridor,
     geared up for travel.

  SAMUELS
     Colonel I'd like to remind you that rescuing
     Doctor Daniel's wife is a secondary objective. In
     the even you fail to notify base camp within 24
     hours, SG-2 will scrub the mission and return
     without you.

  O'NEILL
     Understood.

  KAWALSKY
     Not going to happen, Colonel. SG-2 won't leave
     without you.

  SAMUELS
     All right, let's confirm transmitter codes.
     Remember only the right code will open the iris,
     and if you lose your transmitter, you cannot get
     home.

  CARTER
     Understood, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the Gate Room as the 'gate activates.

  HAMMOND
     (on intercom) SG-1, SG-2, if you do not return in
     24 hours your remote transmitter codes will be
     locked out, and the iris will be sealed
     permanently. At that point there will be no
     return. Is that understood?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir. (He salutes and then says to his team)
     Let's move out.

  ANNOTATION
     They move up the ramp, Daniel among them.

  SAMUELS
     (to Kawalsky) I kinda wish I was going with you.

  KAWALSKY
     Yeah? I'm kinda glad you're staying behind.

  AIRMAN
     All right, let's go, boys.

  ANNOTATION
     They step through, a FRED full of supplies coming
     with them.


LOCATION--CHULAK, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     They roll out of the wormhole and slowly get to
     their feet. They are all covered in frost.

  KAWALSKY
     Damn it, it's cold.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, people, let's get the gear out, let's move.

  DANIEL
     (sneezes) Anybody have Kleenex?


LOCATION--APOPHIS'S PALACE, THE WOMEN'S HOLDING CELL

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c points to where Sha're is sitting.

  TEAL'C
     You.

  ANNOTATION
     They seize her.

  SHA'RE
     No! No!


LOCATION--CHULAK, THE STARGATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is standing over the DHD.

  DANIEL
     Uh, it must be some kind of ceremonial place, the
     'gate is...has to be an integral part of their
     spiritual culture. This place was built for
     worshippers.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah well let's just try and be out of here before
     the worshippees show up huh? You figure out yet
     how to align this 'gate to get back home?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, the device is the same as on Abydos, this
     symbol represents...

  O'NEILL
     You brief Kawalsky's team yet?

  DANIEL
     Yes, this symbol represents...

  O'NEILL
     Good job.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill claps Daniel on the back then walks over
     to Kawalsky.

  KAWALSKY
     We'll have to set up camp where there's better
     cover Colonel.

  CASEY
     Sirs, I found what looks like a trail on the
     mountain. Looks like it's seen traffic in the last
     couple of days.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you, Airman. (to Carter) Carter?

  CARTER
     I've set up a line of claymores along that ridge
     at ten metre intervals.

  O'NEILL
     Sound about right, Kawalsky?

  KAWALSKY
     Yeah, that'll work.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter shoots him a disgusted look and continues
     laying the cable.


LOCATION--IMPLANTATION CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Sha're is brought in, fighting the guards.

  SHA'RE
     No!

  APOPHIS
     Come.

  SHA'RE
     No! No! No!

  ANNOTATION
     She bites one of the guards.

  APOPHIS
     (laughing) This one has spirit!

  ANNOTATION
     He subdues her with the hand device, and they
     remove her clothes, placing her on the slab. The
     priestess comes out, and her symbiote appears from
     the pouch.

  APOPHIS
     Does she please you, my love?

  ANNOTATION
     The symbiote comes out and lays on Sha're's
     stomach. The guards turn her over, and it enters
     her though the neck. She screams. Teal'c watches
     it all stoically.


LOCATION--CHULAK, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The FRED leads the way as SG-1 and SG-2 look for a
     place to set up base camp.

  KAWALSKY
     This looks like a good spot right up here.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop.

  O'NEILL
     All right, if we're not back in 20 hours...

  KAWALSKY
     We'll come rescue your sorry asses.

  O'NEILL
     Negative, you'll go back through the 'gate with
     the combination Daniel just gave you before the
     iris is locked so you can't go back.

  KAWALSKY
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He salutes O'Neill, who returns the salute with a
     smile.

  O'NEILL
     Hold down the fort.

  KAWALSKY
     Pick me up a T-shirt.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 take off.

  CARTER
     So, Doctor Jackson, tell me more about Sha're. How
     did you meet?

  DANIEL
     Sha're, well, she's a...

  O'NEILL
     She was a gift.

  DANIEL
     She was, actually, from the elders of Abydos the
     first time we were there.

  CARTER
     (scandalized) And you accepted?

  O'NEILL
     Hold up.

  DANIEL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     He motions for them to get to cover, and they
     observe a troupe of figures heading their way
     dressed in robes and holding staffs.

  O'NEILL
     All right Captain, take up position fifty yards...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel breaks cover and jumps out in front of the
     figures.

  O'NEILL
     Oh for crying out loud!

  DANIEL
     (to the aliens) Hi, uhm...

  O'NEILL
     (coming out of hiding with Carter) The man has not
     changed.

  DANIEL
     Uh, w-w-we just came through the Stargate. (He
     gets no response.) Uh, the uh, Chapaa'ai...?

  ALIEN
     Chapaa'ai!

  ANNOTATION
     All the aliens kneel down in reverence.

  DANIEL
     Oh, please don't do that.

  O'NEILL
     Friends of yours?

  DANIEL
     Unless we want to give ourselves a bad reputation
     I just think we should avoid shooting the first
     people we meet on a new planet.

  ANNOTATION
     He pushes O'Neill and Carter's weapons to one
     side, then looks back at the aliens and they bow
     their heads.

  DANIEL
     Oh, please, you don't have to do this.

  ANNOTATION
     He lifts the leader up to his feet.

  ALIEN
     Chula a lazla?

  DANIEL
     Lazla...? Choose...They want to know if we're here
     to choose. (O'Neill waves a hand 'yes') Uh, sure,
     we...we can choose...choosing is good. (to
     O'Neill) It's uh, a derivation of Arabic combined
     with...

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, yeah, all right whatever. Just ask 'em to
     take us to the nearest village or town.

  DANIEL
     (to aliens) Uh, would you take us to, uh, uhm,
     arush? Arush?

  ALIEN
     Yah, alla. Chulak. Chulak.

  ANNOTATION
     He leads the way.

  O'NEILL
     Chulak, eh?

  ANNOTATION
     They all follow the aliens to a rise where they
     overlook a town.

  ALIEN
     Chulak!

  DANIEL
     Chulak, s-sounds good.

  O'NEILL
     I hear it's nice this time of year.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk on towards the village, entering a
     courtyard and then into a room where people are
     eating and celebrating. The room falls silent as
     the alien announces them.

  ALIEN
     Atuhara a lazla.

  ANNOTATION
     They are led to seats around the table on the
     floor. All the people are staring at them.

  CARTER
     Why are they treating us like this?

  DANIEL
     They think we're gods.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, we're gods. Now what?

  DANIEL
     I have no idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Someone blows an instrument emitting a low pitched
     note and all the people bow down low. Daniel bows
     down too, looking to the others.

  DANIEL
     When in Rome.

  ANNOTATION
     Heavy footsteps approach. SG-1 bows their heads
     and observe a troupe of Jaffa enter the room, then
     Teal'c, then Apophis and Sha're at his side.

  APOPHIS
     Behold, your Queen.

  ANNOTATION
     He unveils Sha're.

  DANIEL
     Sha're?

  ANNOTATION
     He darts out towards them.

  APOPHIS
     Kneel before your queen!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stops short.

  DANIEL
     Sha're, it's me.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel begins to walk slowly towards his wife.
     Sha're's eyes glow, and Apophis lifts his hand
     device, using it to throw Daniel across the room
     against a far wall. Daniel crumples, unconscious.
     O'Neill raises his gun to shoot Apophis, but
     Sha're steps in the way. O'Neill holds fire in
     shock. A guard hits O'Neill over the head,
     knocking him out.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Samuels enters to find Hammond alone in the dark
     room.

  SAMUELS
     You wanted to see me, sir?

  HAMMOND
     Once we seal the iris, we can still get a
     transmission from our teams?

  SAMUELS
     Yes, sir, but we couldn't be sure it's not the
     aliens. Or one of our own people under duress of
     torture. Sealing the Stargate is the best way...

  HAMMOND
     How much longer do they have?

  HAMMOND
     Just under two hours, sir.


LOCATION--APOPHIS'S PALACE, HOLDING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel lies on the floor unconscious, murmuring.
     Carter attempts to wake him.

  CARTER
     Daniel...Daniel...

  DANIEL
     (waking) Whoa...Sha're!

  CARTER
     Whoa, easy, you've been unconscious for hours.

  DANIEL
     No, I saw her.

  CARTER
     I know, we all did.

  DANIEL
     I was Sha're, she was...

  ANNOTATION
     He gets to his feet, realizing they're in a new
     room. O'Neill moves over to them.

  O'NEILL
     Well if there's way out of here I haven't found it
     yet. But look what I did find.

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara approaches them.

  SKAARA
     Daniel! You're okay.

  DANIEL
     I think so.

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara hugs Daniel. He coughs and they ease him to
     the floor.

  O'NEILL
     Easy big guy. Welcome back to the land of the
     conscious.

  SKAARA
     O'Neill told me about Sha're.

  DANIEL
     Jack, help me. We can find her again.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel...don't. If we can't find our way out of
     here, the mission's a bust anyway. They seal the
     'gate in just over 90 minutes. C'mon, Skaara,
     let's find a way out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     A guard, Teal'c, grabs O'Neill's arm tightly.

  O'NEILL
     Ow!

  TEAL'C
     What is this?

  O'NEILL
     (in discomfort) It's a watch.

  TEAL'C
     (revealing his face) This is not Goa'uld
     technology. Where are you from?

  O'NEILL
     Earth. Chicago if you want to be specific.

  TEAL'C
     Your words mean nothing. Where are you from?

  DANIEL
     Uh, excuse me... (He draws a symbol on the ground)
     This is where we're from.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c scrapes a line through the symbol and walks
     away.


LOCATION--CHULAK, BASE CAMP, DAWN

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky emerges from a tent in the windy clearing
     and looks at the horizon.

  KAWALSKY
     Warren, let's go, rise and shine. The sun is...the
     suns are coming up. We're going to be all right.

  WARREN
     We can't go through another night like that,
     Captain.

  KAWALKSI
     Yeah, gets a little chilly on this planet at
     night. The colonel should've sent us a radio
     message by now.

  WARREN
     When do you have to make your decision, whether or
     not to go back through the Stargate?

  KAWALSKY
     That'll be about when hell freezes over.

  WARREN
     I think that pretty much describes our current
     situation.

  KAWALSKY
     We are not leaving here without the colonel, is
     that understood? Another fine day on Planet
     Kawalsky.


LOCATION--APOPHIS'S PALACE, HOLDING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is testing the strength of bars on one of
     the room's windows. He climbs down to rejoin
     Skaara. Carter is sitting with Daniel a small
     distance away.

  CARTER
     So Ra isn't dead after all.

  DANIEL
     No, it wasn't Ra. It was Apophis.

  CARTER
     Who?

  DANIEL
     Um, it's from Egyptian mythology. Ra was the sun
     god who ruled the day. Apophis was the serpent
     guard, Ra's rival who ruled the night. It's right
     out of The Book of the Dead. They're living it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Skaara walk the room's perimeters.

  SKAARA
     We will save Sha're?

  O'NEILL
     I can't promise you anything at the moment...

  SKAARA
     But you are a great warrior! We defeated Ra
     together!

  O'NEILL
     I know, but take a look around here. Look what
     we're up against.

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara glares at O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     We'll try.

  ANNOTATION
     They move over to the others as the doors open and
     guards march in, led by Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     Shaka ha! Kree hol mel, Goa'uld!

  O'NEILL
     (to Skaara) What'd he say?

  SKAARA
     They're going to choose.

  CARTER
     Choose what?

  SKAARA
     Who will be the children of the gods.

  ANNOTATION
     A royal box is brought in, and Apophis emerges
     from it.

  APOPHIS
     Jaffa!

  ANNOTATION
     He helps Sha're out from the box.

  DANIEL
     Sha're. Jack, help me please.

  ANNOTATION
     He surges forward but Carter and O'Neill pull him
     back.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, don't, don't.

  TEAL'C
     Benna! Ya wan, ya daru! Kneel before your masters!

  ANNOTATION
     Guards move among the people making them kneel.
     O'Neill catches Teal'c's eye who gives him a look,
     asking him to kneel by his expression. O'Neill
     nods imperceptibly and kneels. Skaara does not
     yet.

  O'NEILL
     Skaara.

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara kneels. Robed Goa'uld move among the
     prisoners.

  TEAL'C
     Benna, ya wan ya daru! Choose!

  ANNOTATION
     A guards brings forth a prisoner and holds him up
     for the Goa'uld.

  GOA'ULD
     No. (as the guards toss him aside, the Goa'uld
     moves to another) This one. We choose this one.

  ANNOTATION
     She is escorted away. Other Goa'uld approach where
     SG-1 are kneeling and Daniel leaps forward,
     grabbing one of them. Guards prevent O'Neill from
     interfering.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel!

  GOA'ULD
     (noting Daniel) This one is passionate.

  DANIEL
     How much would I remember if you chose me?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, what are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     A guards taps O'Neill with a staff weapon in
     warning.

  DANIEL
     (distressed) Something of the host must survive.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c shakes his head negatively. O'Neill
     notices.

  GOA'ULD
     We choose...him.

  ANNOTATION
     The Goa'uld points to Skarra.

  SKAARA
     (he is grabbed) Na-nay, na nay! O'Neill! O'Neill!

  O'NEILL
     Skaara! Skaara!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill jumps forward but a guard hits him on the
     nose with a staff weapon. Skaara is dragged off,
     screaming O'Neill's name over and over.

  APOPHIS
     Kill the rest.

  ANNOTATION
     The prisoners scream and run to the back of the
     room as Apophis and the Goa'uld leave. Teal'c and
     his guards remain. They advance and ready their
     weapons, Teal'c at the front of them.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) I can save these people! Help me! Help
     me.

  TEAL'C
     Many have said that. (He turns and fires on his
     own guards, than throws his weapon to O'Neill.)
     But you are the first I believe could do it!

  ANNOTATION
     A firefight ensues. Carter pulls Daniel out of the
     line of fire with her. O'Neill and Teal'c kill the
     guards and scare away the ones at the door.
     O'Neill heads back for the back wall.

  O'NEILL
     (to fellow prisoners) Get out of the way!

  ANNOTATION
     The prisoners scatter and he fires at the wall,
     creating an opening. He checks it.

  O'NEILL
     All right, let's move!

  CARTER
     Come on, come on!

  ANNOTATION
     The people stream through.

  CARTER
     Come on, move, go, come on!

  O'NEILL
     Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c drops his helmet to the floor in the empty
     holding room and looks at the dead Jaffa as
     O'Neill and Daniel help prisoners through the
     opening.

  O'NEILL
     You going to be okay?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pauses, nods, and leaves through the gap.
     O'Neill looks back to Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Hey, c'mon!

  TEAL'C
     I have nowhere to go.

  O'NEILL
     For this you can stay at my place. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks around, then joins O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     What's your name?

  TEAL'C
     Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, where will they take Skaara, the boy?

  TEAL'C
     To the Stargate, after they've selected hosts for
     their children they will return home.

  ANNOTATION
     They follow the stream of prisoners heading for
     the 'gate.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is in his office, overlooking the 'gate.

  SAMUELS
     Sir, they have just under an hour until the
     deadline. We should've heard from them by now.

  HAMMOND
     A lot can happen in an hour, Major.


LOCATION--CHULAK, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and SG-1 leads the prisoners at a fast
     pace.

  O'NEILL
     We've got less than an hour, how we doing?

  CARTER
     We lost a few when we got to the forest.

  TEAL'C
     They will be hunted down and killed. Anyone who
     does not exist to serve the gods is their enemy.

  O'NEILL
     And that makes you...?

  TEAL'C
     I am a Jaffa. Bred to serve, that they may live.

  DANIEL
     I...I don't understand.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c stops and reveals his pouch and his
     symbiote. The prisoners nearby scream.

  O'NEILL
     What the hell is that?

  TEAL'C
     It is an infant Goa'uld, the larval form of the
     gods, I have carried one since I was a child, as
     all Jaffa carry one.

  ANNOTATION
     They resume their walk.

  O'NEILL
     Get it out of there.

  TEAL'C
     In exchange for carrying the infant Goa'uld until
     maturity, a Jaffa receives perfect health and long
     life. If I were to remove it, I would eventually
     die.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, well if I were you, I'd take my chances.


LOCATION--CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A ship flies down and hovers over the 'gate. A
     small distance away O'Neill urges the prisoners
     over the crest of a hill.

  O'NEILL
     All right come on people, let's go, let's move!

  ANNOTATION
     They move.

  TEAL'C
     (to O'Neill) The boy you seek is no longer who he
     was.

  O'NEILL
     I don't want to hear that.

  ANNOTATION
     At the Stargate, the ship's belly reveals a ring
     device which transports down Goa'ulds including
     Skaara, Apophis and Sha're. The ship flies off. As
     the prisoners and SG-1 near the 'gate, a Goa'uld
     glider swoops over them, readying its guns.

  O'NEILL
     Take cover!

  ANNOTATION
     The ship fires as the prisoners scatter--O'Neill
     and Teal'c return fire but make no difference.

  CARTER
     Colonel, we're sitting ducks here!

  ANNOTATION
     At the Stargate, Apophis dials out.

  ANNOTATION
     Nearby, as O'Neill and Teal'c fire ineffectually
     at the ship, suddenly Warren fires a surface to
     air missile from a shoulder mounted firing device.
     It hits and destroys the ship. At the Stargate
     Apophis sees the explosion and steps through the
     Stargate. The prisoners cheer and O'Neill looks up
     to where the missile came from.

  O'NEILL
     Kawalsky.

  KAWALSKY
     Yeah!

  ANNOTATION
     SG-2 waves from the hill.

  O'NEILL
     (turning to the prisoners) C'mon, folks, up the
     hill!

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky moves down to help O'Neill up.

  O'NEILL
     Great shot! How many are there?

  KAWALSKY
     A dozen, maybe more. They're headed back through
     the 'gate.

  O'NEILL
     What about Skaara?

  KAWALSKY
     He's with them. Colonel, we don't have much time
     before they lock us out.

  ANNOTATION
     They run up the hill with the others, Kawalsky
     taking a lead position.

  KAWALSKY
     Warren, Casey, on my right!

  ANNOTATION
     They position themselves at the crest of the hill,
     overlooking the Stargate. O'Neill sees Skaara
     about to enter the 'gate.

  O'NEILL
     No. No.

  ANNOTATION
     He runs down the hill.

  KAWALSKY
     Colonel! Sir!

  O'NEILL
     Skaara!

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara turns and smiles walking back toward
     O'Neill a few steps.

  O'NEILL
     Skaara.

  ANNOTATION
     Skaara's smile disappears, his eyes glow, and he
     hits O'Neill with his hand device. O'Neill is
     thrown back and hits the ground as Skaara leaves
     and the 'gate deactivates. O'Neill gets to his
     feet as the others run down to him.

  DANIEL
     Did you see the symbols?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes his head.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is still overlooking the Gate Room.
     Samuels enters.

  SAMUELS
     Sir the deadline has been reached. Standing by to

LOCATION--CHULAK, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Warren and Casey are on the hill, looking back to
     the forest with binoculars when they spot
     movement.

  WARREN
     (into radio) Sir, we've got movement in the trees,
     a lot of movement in the trees. We've got
     hostiles, sir, hostiles closing in!

  ANNOTATION
     At the Stargate, Kawalsky takes control.

  KAWALSKY
     All right, people we're going on a little field
     trip. Daniel get busy on that Stargate, we've got
     company. (to Carter) Captain, arm your claymores.
     Me, Casey and Warren'll be the last men out.

  O'NEILL
     Negative. That's my job. Captain, help Daniel.
     Once you've sent the signal I want you to go
     through, tell them we're bringing company.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone flocks to the Stargate.

  KAWALSKY
     (into his radio) Boys, give me an update!

  WARREN
     (into his radio) Looks like a whole battalion,
     sir. 200 yards and closing.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky readies the claymores as Carter stands
     with Daniel who is searching for the Stargate
     address in his notebook.

  CARTER
     Doctor Jackson?

  DANIEL
     I've got it, I know I have it here, I know I've
     got it.

  CARTER
     Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     On the hill, the Warren and Casey fall to their
     bellies as they spy forces coming from the trees.

  WARREN
     (into radio) Sir, we've got hostiles coming out of
     the trees.

  ANNOTATION
     They start firing on the advancing Jaffa guards.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and Samuels are still standing overlooking
     the Gate Room.

  SAMUELS
     Sir.

  HAMMOND
     All right. Seal it off, lock out their
     transmitters.

  SAMUELS
     Yes, sir!

  ANNOTATION
     He goes down the staircase.


LOCATION--CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY

  O'NEILL
     Daniel!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel finally finds the address in his notebook.

  DANIEL
     (laughing) Oh here!

  CARTER
     Go go!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel starts dialling. On the hill the soldiers
     are being overpowered.

  WARREN
     (into radio) We can't hold them, sir!

  DANIEL
     (to Carter) Send the signal as soon as it opens,
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     She holds her arm with the remote transmitter up.

  O'NEILL
     (to Kawalsky) Pull 'em out!

  KAWALSKY
     (into radio) Fall back, fall back!

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate opens.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Samuels runs up the stairs.

  SAMUELS
     Sir, a wormhole has just been established on the
     other side.

  HAMMOND
     (heading down the stairs) Belay my last order. Do
     not seal the 'gate or lock out their transmitter
     codes.

  SAMUELS
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  HAMMOND
     (entering Control Room) Do we have a remote
     transmitter signal?

  TECHNICIAN
     No signal yet, General.


LOCATION--CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY

  DANIEL
     Is it working?

  CARTER
     Oh, let's hope so. If not, I'll be the first to
     know.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     On the computer, the transmitter code has been
     received.

  TECHNICIAN
     Oh wait, there it is.

  ANNOTATION
     They look to the Stargate and watch as the iris
     opens.


LOCATION--CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Warren and Casey run down the hill from their
     positions, towards the Stargate. They take
     defensive positions behind rock and continue
     firing on the guards as they reach the crest of
     the hill. Carter steps through the 'gate, and
     Daniel starts to encourage the prisoners to go
     after her.

  DANIEL
     Come on, come on, come on.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter rolls through the 'gate onto the ramp and
     stands, putting out a hand as two prisoners follow
     after her. The soldiers around the 'gate raise
     their guns.

  CARTER
     Hold your fire! They're refugees!

  ANNOTATION
     She helps them to their feet.

  HAMMOND
     (on the intercom) I hope you know what you're
     doing, Captain.


LOCATION--CHULAK, STARGATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     They are still firing against the guards as Daniel
     gets the last of the prisoners through the 'gate.

  DANIEL
     Come on, please, two of you, two of you!

  ANNOTATION
     The guards step over the crest of the hill and
     O'Neill turns to Kawalsky.

  O'NEILL
     Hit the claymores!

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky does so and they explode, taking a line
     of guards with them. He hits another and another
     and the guards go down in droves. But there are
     still more and one of the prisoners is hit by
     enemy fire.

  DANIEL
     Hurry! Come on, come on. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. We
     need cover here!

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky stands from his hiding place and screams,
     firing his weapon wildly. Daniel gets the last
     refugee through the 'gate.

  DANIEL
     (to O'Neill) That's it!

  O'NEILL
     Go!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pauses for one reluctant second and then
     runs through the 'gate.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky runs for the 'gate, as do the other
     soldiers.

  CASEY
     Go, go, go!

  KAWALSKY
     Colonel, more hostiles, eight o'clock.

  ANNOTATION
     They retreat while firing on the encroaching
     guards. Casey is hit by a staff blast.

  KAWALSKY
     Casey!

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky and O'Neill move to him and drag him
     towards the 'gate, setting him down on the steps,
     always firing their weapons. One of the prisoners
     who had stayed wrestling a guard--squeezing him to
     death. The guard fall near to Kawalsky and its
     symbiote rises out of its pouch, it flies through
     the air and whips into Kawalsky's neck. He
     freezes, then groans, and it disappears into his
     neck. Teal'c and the prisoner leap through the
     'gate.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The prisoner jumps out of the 'gate and the
     soldiers cock their weapons, as Teal'c come
     through. Carter and Daniel call out simultaneously
     to stop them firing.

  CARTER AND DANIEL
     Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

  CARTER
     They're with us!

  ANNOTATION
     She walks up to Teal'c and receives his weapon
     from him with a nod.

     the 'gate--the guards are close on their heels and
     run through the 'gate after them.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The three fall through the 'gate; Casey collapses
     to the ramp.

  CARTER
     Now! Lock it up, lock it up!

  TECHNICIAN
     (over the intercom) Closing iris!

  ANNOTATION
     The iris closes, and they hear four metallic thuds
     as the guards that followed hit the metal. Then
     the sounds stop.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over the intercom) Wormhole disengaged.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens. Medics rush up the ramp as they
     are called.

  AIRMAN
     Medic! Medic!

  O'NEILL
     (to Kawalsky, motioning to Casey) You got him?

  KAWALSKY
     Yeah, I got him, thanks. Hold on here, get these
     people back.

  ANNOTATION
     The refugees surge forward and circle Carter and
     O'Neill, hugging and thanking them warmly.

  MEDIC
     We've got to help these people, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks up the ramp, amidst the confusion as
     Samuels clear the way for the medics.

  SAMUELS
     Let's go, man down, stand back! Stand back!

  ANNOTATION
     The medics lift Casey on to a stretcher.

  MEDIC
     Let's get him to the infirmary, let's get him
     inside.

  ANNOTATION
     They depart.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill. Care to explain?

  CARTER
     Um, we can use the Stargate to send these people
     home, sir.

  HAMMOND
     (motioning to Teal'c) What's he doing here?

  O'NEILL
     General Hammond, this is Teal'c. He can help us.

  HAMMOND
     Do you know what he is?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir I do, he's the man who saved our lives.
     And if you accept my recommendation, sir...he'll
     join SG-1.

  HAMMOND
     That decision may not be up to you.

  SAMUELS
     Stand back. Let's get 'em off the ramp.

  ANNOTATION
     Kawalsky is on his knees, looking a little
     distressed.

  O'NEILL
     Kawalsky, are you all right?

  KAWALSKY
     Yeah, I'm good.

  ANNOTATION
     He stands and regains his composure.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill, Major Kawalsky, this
     sure-to-be-very-interesting debriefing for SG
     units 1 and 2 will be at 0730.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  SAMUELS
     All right, let's get these people situated.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave the Gate Room, leaving Teal'c, Carter,
     Daniel and O'Neill standing at the base of the
     ramp. Daniel looks back to the Stargate.

  DANIEL
     She's out there somewhere, Jack.

  O'NEILL
     I know. So's Skaara.

  DANIEL
     So what do we do?

  O'NEILL
     We find 'em.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves, and the others follow. Behind them,
     Kawalsky is still standing at the top of the ramp,
     almost inside the Stargate. He walks down the ramp
     towards the camera and as he gets close, his eyes
     glow.
