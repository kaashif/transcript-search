Beast Of Burden
TEASER

LOCATION--P3X-888, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is in the distance. An energy bar has
     been left on a rock. An Unas, Chaka, comes out of
     the forest and stalks slowly towards the energy
     bar, growling. The zoom lens of a video camera is
     seen half-hidden in the bushes. Chaka picks up the
     bar, sniffs it, and licks it. He turns suddenly as
     he hears a noise. He growls, adopting a fighting
     stance. Four men approach. Chaka looks at the men,
     then at the energy bar, before reaching out,
     offering the bar to the men. The leader of the
     group zats Chaka.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel watches the taped footage of events on
     P3X-888.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The film of the Unas is being shown on the big
     screen.

  DANIEL
     As you know, over the past year, I have been
     studying the Unas of P3X-888. I've made some
     amazing discoveries about their social structure
     and their culture. I've also been able to
     categorise almost seventy individual words from
     their language. But, during a review of the latest
     batch of digital images, I came across this. (He
     turns on the tape). These men, whoever they are,
     abducted the Unas I refer to as Chaka.

  CARTER
     That's the one that kidnapped you?

  DANIEL
     Same one. Their dress indicates
     preindustrialisation, but they don't seem to have
     any Jaffa tattoos, so the presence of Goa'uld
     weapons seems contradictory.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  O'NEILL
     What would they want with an Unas?

  DANIEL
     I don't know...but I'd like to find out.

  HAMMOND
     What are you suggesting?

  DANIEL
     Well, like I said, I'd like to find out what they
     want with an Unas.

  O'NEILL
     For the record, I don't care. (The others give him
     "looks".) I care.

  DANIEL
     I also think it might be relevant to investigate
     how these men got Goa'uld weapons and from where.

  TEAL'C
     They may have other Goa'uld technology as well.

  O'NEILL
     Now see? That I really care about.

  DANIEL
     And if possible, I'd like to make every effort to
     rescue Chaka.

  O'NEILL
     The Unas?

  DANIEL
     Remember most of the Unas we've encountered have
     had Goa'uld symbiotes controlling them. Chaka is
     an un-Goa'ulded Unas, an intelligent being who
     learned to trust humans because of me.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  DANIEL
     (Turns back to screen) These images were taken
     just prior to the abduction. See, every time I
     went back with SG-11 to retrieve the video
     footage, I would leave Chaka a gift.

  ANNOTATION
     He stops the tape at the point where Chaka offers
     the man the energy bar.

  DANIEL
     It's uh, it's an energy bar. It's something that
     helped me break through when we first met. I left
     the bait for their trap.

  CARTER
     How do we find out where these men took him?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel clicks on a picture of the DHD, focusing on
     the glyphs, some of which are lit.

  O'NEILL
     Well, General, if they've got Goa'uld weapons, you
     got to wonder what else they got.

  HAMMOND
     (After considering for a moment) You have a go.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate on the planet kawooshes, and SG-1
     come through.

  CARTER
     The UAV shows the nearest of the surrounding towns
     to be three clicks in that direction. Evidence of
     a substantial population, lots of cultivated
     fields.

  DANIEL
     Farmers?

  O'NEILL
     Farmers with staff weapons.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 reach a vantage point from where they can see
     a village. Daniel looks through his binoculars,
     and sees an Unas pulling a log. A man follows the
     Unas, with a whip.

  DANIEL
     Domestication.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. (To Carter) We'll check things out down
     there. Carter, you and Teal'c hang back, cover us
     in case these folks don't like visitors. (To
     Daniel) Any ideas?

  DANIEL
     Well, let's see how far honesty gets us.

  O'NEILL
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel head towards the village.


LOCATION--THE VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     An auction is in progress.

  BURROCK
     This animal comes from an excellent bloodline. He
     can press grain at the stone mill from first light
     to day's end. He can haul any cart with any load,
     any distance.

  ANNOTATION
     A man strikes the Unas, who growls.

  BURROCK
     And he has spirit.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas is hit again. He growls more loudly.

  MALE VILLAGER #1
     He's probably inbred.

  BURROCK
     Who will start the bidding?

  MALE VILLAGER #2
     Which do you prefer?

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock pushes the Unas, who strikes Burrock and
     starts to run away.

  FEMALE VILLAGER
     Watch out!

  MALE VILLAGER #3
     Stand back!

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock shoots the Unas twice in the back with his
     staff weapon. The Unas collapses, badly injured
     and growling.

  BURROCK
     (To O'Neill and Daniel as they approach) Do not
     fear. It is dead.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. Shoot something like that in the back a
     couple times, it's...

  BURROCK
     Who are you?

  DANIEL
     We're travellers, peaceful travellers.

  BURROCK
     Where do you come from? I've not seen your kind
     before.

  DANIEL
     Well, actually, we came through the Stargate. The,
     um...

  ANNOTATION
     He makes a circle in the air.

  BURROCK
     Chappa'ai?

  DANIEL
     Chappa'ai.

  BURROCK
     Really?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers whisper to each other.

  BURROCK
     No one has come through the Chappa'ai for as long
     as anyone can remember.

  O'NEILL
     Well, now you'll have a story to tell your
     grandkids.

  DANIEL
     We come from a planet called Earth.

  BURROCK
     What do you want?

  DANIEL
     Actually we came to trade.

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) Hm?

  BURROCK
     Really?

  DANIEL
     We're looking for an Unas.

  BURROCK
     Well then. You've come to the right place. I'm the
     most respected dealer of Unas in this land. My
     name is Burrock.

  DANIEL
     I'm Daniel Jackson, and this is Colonel Jack
     O'Neill.

  BURROCK
     Colonel?

  DANIEL
     Yes, it means he's our head trader.

  O'NEILL
     (Glancing at Daniel) Head trader?

  BURROCK
     I like that! And you can call me Colonel Burrock.
     It is our custom to welcome visitors with a drink.
     Will you join me?

  O'NEILL
     It is our custom to drink. Of course! (To Daniel)
     Honesty, huh?

  DANIEL
     We're traders.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  DANIEL
     We're traders, we've traded, we trade...


LOCATION--A BUILDING IN THE VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     An Unas brings a tray of drinks to the table where
     O'Neill, Daniel and Burrock are sitting.

  DANIEL
     (to Unas) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas looks at him, startled.

  BURROCK
     (astonished) You thank a beast?

  DANIEL
     Yes, uh positive reinforcement. We find it a
     successful method of training.

  BURROCK
     I'm curious to learn more about your methods. And
     to learn more about where you came from.

  DANIEL
     So, no one else has actually come through the
     Chappa'ai?

  BURROCK
     I have often wondered why there are so many
     symbols on the pedestal. I have stood for hours on
     end pressing different combinations, but nothing
     happened. The fact that you have come here, from a
     place we do not know, proves that I am right. The
     Chappa'ai goes many places, does it not?

  DANIEL
     Haven't you travelled to other worlds?

  BURROCK
     I have been to one other place. Just one time so
     far. I had to press seven different symbols to get
     the Chappa'ai to open.

  DANIEL
     And how did you learn those symbols?

  BURROCK
     (Laughing) I paid dearly for them. They have been
     passed down through the lineage of certain
     families since the Beast Wars.

  O'NEILL
     Beast wars?

  BURROCK
     Generations ago, the beasts enslaved our
     forefathers through terror and oppression. They
     served the one with the glowing eyes.

  DANIEL
     And what happened to him, her?

  BURROCK
     No one knows. One day he went away, did not
     return. Our forefathers, they learned how the
     beast's weapons worked, and led an uprising. The
     war was bloody, waged for many years. But
     eventually the slaves triumphed, and the masters
     became the slaves. Since then, the Beasts have
     served us.


LOCATION--THE VILLAGE SQUARE

  ANNOTATION
     An Unas in a stockade is being tortured by men
     with pain-sticks.

  BURROCK
     Like the one at the auction that got away, this
     one comes from our local stock. I believe him to
     be untrainable.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas is continuing to resist.

  BURROCK
     His head is not right. Even for a beast.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe he's just pissed because you keep torturing
     him.

  BURROCK
     The unfortunate result of generations of
     inbreeding.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas is growling as he tries to resist the
     torture.

  BURROCK
     I'm afraid he will have to be put down. Do you not
     have this problem where you come from?

  O'NEILL
     Ah, we've made some progress, actually.

  BURROCK
     Interesting. The only choice we had was to
     introduce new blood. Fortunately, I was able to
     find some.

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock leads O'Neill and Daniel to a barn, where
     an Unas is raking hay and others are locked in
     cages.

  BURROCK
     This one will make me the wealthiest beastmaster
     in the land.

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka tries to swipe at Burrock through the bars
     of his cage. He stops when he sees Daniel.

  CHAKA
     Dan'al.

  BURROCK
     He speaks?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  BURROCK
     Your name?

  DANIEL
     Yes. That's because he's mine.

  BURROCK
     You deceived me! You said you came here to trade
     for an Unas--not to claim one of your own.

  DANIEL
     We just wanted to make sure he was here before we
     made an issue out of it.

  BURROCK
     These beasts--all of them bear my mark.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows a brand on the hand of one of the Unas.

  BURROCK
     Yours had no such identification.

  DANIEL
     Well, you heard him say my name.

  BURROCK
     I caught him in the wild on the other place.

  DANIEL
     It was part of an experiment I was conducting. I'm
     sorry, but I really need him back.

  BURROCK
     I am sorry--you can not have him.

  ANNOTATION
     Two men enter the barn, carrying zats. O'Neill
     looks at Daniel and sighs.


LOCATION--THE HILL BEHIND THE VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c are waiting. Carter looks
     through binoculars and sees the two men at the
     door of the barn.

  TEAL'C
     Does Colonel O'Neill require our assistance?

  CARTER
     He hasn't signalled yet.


LOCATION--THE BARN

  BURROCK
     I could offer another Unas in exchange. This one
     is of good stock. And he's already trained.

  DANIEL
     You don't understand. This one's name is Chaka,
     and he is coming with me.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel...

  DANIEL
     Jack?

  O'NEILL
     Why don't we discuss what we can offer the man in
     return? Shall we? Outside?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel raises a finger in a signal to Chaka to
     wait.

  CHAKA
     Dan'al!


LOCATION--THE VILLAGE SQUARE

  ANNOTATION
     An Unas is growling at a group of men and trying
     to attack them.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, we're not going to get into a firefight
     over this right now.

  BURROCK
     If you expect to trade for that Unas, do not think
     it will come cheap.

  O'NEILL
     So, what's your price?

  BURROCK
     Two Unas of equally pure lineage.

  O'NEILL
     Two for one, eh?

  BURROCK
     Your Unas is worth it, or you would not have
     travelled all this way. Besides, you obviously
     have more sophisticated methods for capturing and
     trading them.

  O'NEILL
     We'll think about it. (To Daniel) Come on.

  DANIEL
     (To O'Neill, as they walk away) Excuse me. You uh,
     have some sort of plan to do something about this,
     or er...

  O'NEILL
     Well, right now, I'm not sure I'm going to do
     anything.

  DANIEL
     How can you say that?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, you wanna go out and catch a couple Unas,
     trade 'em for Chaka? Is that it?

  DANIEL
     I think you're missing the point here.

  O'NEILL
     Am I?

  DANIEL
     You saw how they keep them, how they treat them.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, I'm not saying any of this is right. I'm
     saying I don't know what to do about it.

  DANIEL
     I'm not asking you to change their way of life,
     but Chaka wasn't born in this kind of
     domestication. He's known freedom his whole life.
     The Unas of his planet live together in families,
     they love their children, they have art.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, yes, I've seen the cave drawings.

  DANIEL
     I will not leave him here like this.

  O'NEILL
     Even if it means risking human lives?

  DANIEL
     Well, we should be able to avoid that, shouldn't
     we?


LOCATION--THE TOP OF THE HILL

  CARTER
     (As O'Neill and Daniel approach) So, what's going
     on?

  DANIEL
     They're using Unas as slaves. They've been
     inbreeding them so long, they've become
     untrainable. They needed new blood, and they have
     Chaka--and they're not giving him up.

  CARTER
     So, what are we going to do?

  O'NEILL
     We'll wait until dark. Daniel and I'll go in and
     extract him. You'll provide cover. And we're going
     to do it without taking human lives.


LOCATION--THE VILLAGE SQUARE

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock is "training" an Unas with a pain-stick.

  BURROCK
     Down!

  ANNOTATION
     He prods the Unas who growls in agony.

  BURROCK
     Down!

  ANNOTATION
     He hits the Unas again.


LOCATION--THE BARN WHERE CHAKA AND THE OTHER UNAS ARE BEING HELD

  ANNOTATION
     An Unas brings food which he puts down outside
     Chaka's cage.

  CHAKA
     Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     The other Unas looks at Chaka.

  CHAKA
     Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas growls and looks at Chaka.

  UNAS
     Chaka.

  ANNOTATION
     He hears something and scampers away.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill enter the barn.

  DANIEL
     Chaka!

  CHAKA
     Dan'al!

  O'NEILL
     Tell him to move back.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts an explosive in the lock of the cage.

  DANIEL
     Chaka...

  O'NEILL
     He's not moving.

  DANIEL
     Move back.

  O'NEILL
     I could have said that!

  DANIEL
     Keka! Keka! Danger!

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka moves away. O'Neill lights the fuse to the
     explosive. The other Unas growl and rattle the
     bars of their cages when the explosive flares.

  O'NEILL
     Crap!

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls open the door to Chaka's cage.

  O'NEILL
     Come on--we got to go!

  DANIEL
     (To Chaka) Come on, come on! No, it's okay. It's
     okay, come on!

  CHAKA
     (Pointing to the other Unas in their cages) Wok
     tah!

  DANIEL
     What? No! I don't know what's wrong. Come on, come
     on.

  CHAKA
     Wok tah!

  DANIEL
     He says this one's marked for death. Come on, it's
     OK.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel tries to pull Chaka towards the door.

  DANIEL
     Come on, let's go!

  CHAKA
     (Stopping Daniel) Wok tah! Wok tah!

  DANIEL
     He says that they're all marked for death. (To
     Chaka) No, Chaka. Ka keka!

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, with or without him--we got to go!


LOCATION--THE HILL OVERLOOKING THE VILLAGE, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Carter covers them, from the top of the hill,
     while Teal'c has moved down to the village. The
     villagers start shouting.

  CARTER
     (Into radio.) Sir! You've got company. (Teal'c
     fires his staff weapon towards the villagers. They
     scream and run away. Carter is also shooting over
     the heads of the crowd, from her position on the
     hill.)

  CARTER
     (Into radio.) At least ten men heading your way.
     We're laying down cover fire.


LOCATION--THE BARN.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shoots at a man standing in the window
     above him, but O'Neill is zatted. Daniel tries to
     shoot the man, but is also zatted by Burrock, as
     is Chaka.


LOCATION--THE CAGES IN THE BARN

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill are locked in the cages, with
     Chaka in a cage between them.

  CARTER
     (Over radio) Colonel, come in, over.

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka picks up the radio from the straw in his
     cage.

  CARTER
     (Over radio) Colonel? Do you read? Come in. Over.

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka looks at the radio, then at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Chaka must have grabbed that from my vest before
     it was taken away.

  O'NEILL
     Why would he do that?

  DANIEL
     He's seen me use it. He knows what it's for.
     Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gestures at Chaka to give him the radio.

  DANIEL
     Give.

  CHAKA
     Ko?

  DANIEL
     Ko? I don't know that word. (Chaka holds out the
     radio.) Ko? Give? Yes, yes, Chaka! Give. Ko, ko.

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka throws the radio to Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.

  CHAKA
     Aka.

  DANIEL
     Aka--thank you.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill makes a "get on with it" gesture.

  DANIEL
     Right. (Into radio) Sam, it's Daniel. Do you read?

  CARTER
     Daniel, are you okay?

  DANIEL
     Uh, I've been better.

  CARTER
     Colonel O'Neill?

  DANIEL
     Uh, physically fine. But, uh I'm not expecting a
     birthday present any time soon.

  O'NEILL
     (Impatient) Ko! (Chaka looks at him.) Ko!

  DANIEL
     Chaka?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel holds the radio out through the bars
     towards Chaka.

  DANIEL
     Ko.

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka takes the radio and gives it to O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you. (Into radio) Carter? Report.

  CARTER
     There were too many of them, Sir. You ordered us
     not to shoot to kill. We couldn't stop them.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I know.

  CARTER
     We're currently being pursued by search parties.
     We're attempting to get to the Gate to get
     reinforcements.

  O'NEILL
     Roger that--out.

  CHAKA
     (Going to Daniel's cage) Dan'al--Chaka!

  DANIEL
     Chaka.

  CHAKA
     Aka na.

  DANIEL
     Ma--ma kan.

  CHAKA
     Aka na! Keka!

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up the shackles.

  DANIEL
     Ma kan!

  CHAKA
     Aka na!

  DANIEL
     Kan Ska nat!

  CHAKA
     Chaka! Chaka!

  O'NEILL
     (Whispering to Daniel) What's he saying?

  DANIEL
     Well, actually that means a lot of different
     things. In this particular case, I'd say "Thank
     you for trying to free me. Sorry for getting you
     into this mess."

  CHAKA
     Chaka!

  O'NEILL
     Chocka full of nuts--whatever.

  DANIEL
     Jack, it's not his fault.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, I'm chained up in a madman's barn with a
     bunch of Unas. Who's to blame is not at the top of
     my list of concerns just yet.

  CHAKA
     Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     He catches the attention of another Unas in the
     barn.

  CHAKA
     Chaka!

  UNAS
     Chaka!

  DANIEL
     That's amazing!

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DANIEL
     Language is a learned behaviour. Chaka must have
     taught this Unas his word. (To Unas as Daniel
     points at Chaka.) Chaka!

  UNAS
     Chaka. (Points to Chaka) Chaka zo.

  UNAS 2
     Chaka zo.

  ANNOTATION
     The three Unas growl.

  DANIEL
     They say Chaka is their leader! They must
     recognise that he wouldn't leave without them.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, dogs sniff each other's butts, and they're
     friends for life. We still keep them as pets.

  DANIEL
     No, no, this is different. Chaka made a choice.
     Choice is freedom. These Unas have placed their
     allegiance in him because of that.

  O'NEILL
     What are you saying?

  DANIEL
     I'm saying that they want to be free, they
     recognise what that means.

  O'NEILL
     All he said was "Chaka zo".

  UNAS #1
     Chaka zo!

  UNAS #2
     Chaka zo!

  DANIEL
     I was wrong! Chaka--Chaka isn't different! These
     Unas may have been born into domestication, but
     they still know what freedom means. They know it
     enough to want it.

  O'NEILL
     You said yourself. This is their way of life here.

  DANIEL
     Well, it has to change.

  O'NEILL
     How?

  DANIEL
     Well, we've meddled in other planet's cultures
     before...

  O'NEILL
     Well, now you're talking about moving in an army.

  DANIEL
     I'd like to think that there was another way.

  O'NEILL
     Look, in principle, I agree with you...

  ANNOTATION
     The door of the barn opens. Chaka growls as an
     Unas enters. The Unas is holding a young boy by
     the hand.

  BOY
     You injured my father.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry. I really am.

  DANIEL
     We were just trying to take back an Unas that's
     rightfully ours.

  BOY
     Stealing is wrong.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, it is.

  CHAKA
     (To the Unas holding the boy's hand) Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas reacts.

  CHAKA
     Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas leads the boy out of the barn, putting
     his arm round the child's shoulders.

  O'NEILL
     Trust me, Daniel. A whole lot of people are going
     to have to die around here before one Unas goes
     free.


LOCATION--THE FOREST, LEADING TO THE STARGATE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks through her binoculars. The Stargate
     is heavily guarded.

  CARTER
     Colonel, do you read?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, Carter. What's your situation?

  CARTER
     (Into radio) We're at the Gate, Sir, but it's
     heavily guarded. (Carter's voice from radio) We
     can attempt to get through, but it's going to get
     ugly.

  O'NEILL
     Hold your position. Radio silence. Got to go!

  BURROCK
     (Entering the barn) Beast stealing is punishable
     by death. But it is my hope that that will not be
     necessary. But that will be up to you. I also know
     there were others with you and that they may try
     to rescue you. That would not be wise. I will not
     hesitate to kill you.

  DANIEL
     What do you want?

  BURROCK
     Tell me of the places where the Chappa'ai can go.
     I do not understand why you take such risks for
     this Beast. He's very valuable to me, but
     certainly you can replace him with one of equal
     lineage.

  DANIEL
     Because they're not beasts. They're self-aware,
     intelligent beings, and you have no right to use
     them as slaves or treat them like you do.

  BURROCK
     They used our forefathers as slaves, and treated
     them much worse than we treat our Unas.

  DANIEL
     And that makes you right?

  BURROCK
     What would you have us do?

  DANIEL
     Free them.

  BURROCK
     (laughing) Untrained, uncontrolled? A Beast would
     rip me limb from limb, eat me alive!

  DANIEL
     Then send them to their home world.

  BURROCK
     Our forefathers could have slaughtered them all,
     wiped them from the face of the planet. But
     instead, they saw a way to use their strength to
     our advantage. A way to co-exist. For that, we
     thank them.

  DANIEL
     You don't co-exist--you use them as slaves.

  O'NEILL
     Look, we're not going to tell you anything, so you
     might as well just let us go. We'll go back to
     where we came from, you can go on doing what you
     do so well.

  BURROCK
     Because now I know for certain, there is more out
     there.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I know, the grass always looks cleaner. Fact
     is, there's a whole bunch of bad guys with glowing
     eyes out there, and you really don't wanna mess
     with them.

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock moves to O'Neill's cage and puts the
     pain-stick against the lock. The charge travels
     through to the chain on O'Neill's leg. He
     collapses in agony.


LOCATION--THE HILL OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE.

  CARTER
     Teal'c?

  TEAL'C
     I will not continue to do nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c heads towards the village.

  CARTER
     What are you going to do? Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gets up and goes after him.


LOCATION--THE BARN

  DANIEL
     Stop! He's not going to tell you anything!

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock removes the pain-stick from the door and
     leaves O'Neill gasping with pain on the floor of
     the cage. Burrock goes to Daniel's cage. The
     pain-stick is held against the lock, making Daniel
     collapse in agony.

  CHAKA
     Keka!

  ANNOTATION
     The other Unas growl and rattle the bars of their
     cages.

  BURROCK
     (Yells) Quiet!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas continue to growl and rattle the bars.

  BURROCK
     (Yelling) Quiet down! Quiet! Quiet!

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock shoots one of the Unas with O'Neill's
     P-90, then turns and points the gun at the other
     Unas.

  CHAKA
     Ka keka!

  DANIEL
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock pulls the trigger, but the gun just
     clicks. It's out of ammunition.

  BURROCK
     Impressive weapon. But not as efficient as a fire
     stick. It seems to stop working after it's been
     fired for a while. I assume that's what these are
     for. (He indicates a clip of ammunition.) Tell me
     how to make it work again.

  O'NEILL
     Give it to me, and I'll show you.

  BURROCK
     It was simple enough to learn how to shoot it. I
     will learn this part on my own as well. In the
     meantime, hunger and thirst will weaken you.
     Perhaps tomorrow, you will tell me what I want to
     know.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks over at the dead Unas.

  BURROCK
     I do not understand why, but it seems that you
     care for Beasts more than you care for your own
     well being. So be it. Every morning and every
     night I will come in here to learn what you know.
     If you do not tell me, I will kill a Beast. It may
     cost me, but I believe it may be worth it.

  ANNOTATION
     Burrock walks to the door of the barn, then turns
     towards O'Neill and Daniel.

  BURROCK
     Until tonight.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c are hiding from behind a
     building.

  CARTER
     Look, Teal'c. Maybe we could take out those four
     guys, but there's dozens more who'll be on us in
     seconds. Then we'd have to get through the Gate.

  TEAL'C
     A diversion? (The following scene cuts between
     O'Neill and Daniel in the barn, and Carter and
     Teal'c outside in the village.)

  ANNOTATION
     Static sounds from a radio opening and closing a
     channel.

  O'NEILL
     (Answering the radio) Yeah, Carter? I got ya.

  CARTER
     Sir, what's your status? We heard shooting.

  O'NEILL
     We're all right. One of the Unas took a hit.

  CARTER
     Chaka?

  O'NEILL
     No, he's okay. I thought I told you to hold your
     position at the Gate.

  CARTER
     Yes, Sir. However, Teal'c thinks we might be able
     to create a big enough distraction to attempt a
     rescue, and I agree. But, we can't guarantee zero
     casualties. If that's still your concern, please
     advise. Over.

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) I don't think we're going to talk our
     way out of this one.

  DANIEL
     Well, for once, I'm not asking us to.

  O'NEILL
     Dammit, Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Let's get out of here--all of us.

  CARTER
     Sir, still awaiting your orders.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. We've got three Unas who are going to be
     joining us. Do what you have to do, Carter.


LOCATION--IN THE VILLAGE

  MALE VILLAGER #1
     (To an Unas pulling a cart) You! Leave it--come
     here!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c edges around a haycart, as Carter heads for
     some water barrels. She sets a charge of C4. The
     haycart explodes.

  MALE VILLAGER #1
     Quick! Water! Before the fire spreads to the
     buildings!

  ANNOTATION
     Villagers start running towards the water barrels,
     when they explode. Teal'c shoots at the men
     standing guard on the barn.

  MALE VILLAGER #2
     Get him!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c runs away from the barn, with most of the
     villagers chasing him. Carter edges up from behind
     and zats the men still outside the barn. She goes
     into the barn.


LOCATION--THE BARN

  O'NEILL
     (Setting explosive charges) Where's Teal'c?

  CARTER
     Trying to be popular.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill ignites the fuse on his lock as Carter
     sets a charge to release Daniel.

  CARTER
     Stand back!

  DANIEL
     Keka!

  CHAKA
     Keka.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas moves back, away from the bars of the
     cage. Carter blows the charge, as O'Neill and
     Daniel get out of their cages.

  DANIEL
     Come on! Come on!

  CHAKA
     Ka cha. Ka cha!


LOCATION--THE VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers are rushing around, trying to get
     water to douse the flames.

  MALE VILLAGER #3
     (pointing a staff weapon at O'Neill and the
     others) Stop!

  O'NEILL
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     The villager sees O'Neill's P-90, drops his staff
     and runs off. O'Neill, Daniel, Carter, Chaka and
     the other Unas run from the village. As they head
     towards the Stargate, Chaka stops.

  DANIEL
     Chaka! It's okay! Chaka, ka nay. Friend.

  CHAKA
     (Looking at Teal'c) Fre-end.

  ANNOTATION
     They come to the clearing where the Stargate is.
     There are no guards around.

  O'NEILL
     I thought you said the Gate was heavily guarded.

  TEAL'C
     The men may have gone to town to help put out the
     fire.

  O'NEILL
     Or we got an ambush here.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the Unas runs out into the clearing.

  O'NEILL
     Hey! Hey! Stop!

  DANIEL
     Keka, Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka turns to look at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Keka!

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka nods, but continues towards the clearing.

  DANIEL
     I think he understands why we stopped.

  O'NEILL
     All right. Fan out--cover them.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill was right: it is an ambush. One of the
     Unas is shot in the back twice by a villager in a
     tree. Teal'c shoots him, and the villager falls
     from the tree. Another villager is hit O'Neill.
     Daniel zats a third man. Chaka attacks a fourth
     villager, until Burrock intervenes, pointing his
     staff weapon at Chaka.

  DANIEL
     Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel fires his zat at Burrock, narrowly missing
     him. Burrock fires back, also missing. One of the
     other Unas jumps on Burrock, but he throws the
     Unas off, pointing his staff weapon at the Unas
     who is lying on the ground. Chaka shoots Burrock
     in the shoulder, then primes the staff weapon
     again.

  DANIEL
     Chaka! No!

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka shoots Burrock. He pulls the other Unas to
     his feet, picking up Burrock's staff weapon.

  CHAKA
     A cha'ka.

  UNAS #1
     Chaka.

  CARTER
     We're all clear, Sir. Teal'c's dialling the Gate.
     We should hurry, there might be more men coming.

  DANIEL
     Chaka, come on, we're taking you home.

  CHAKA
     No na.

  DANIEL
     No na--home.

  CHAKA
     Aka.

  DANIEL
     No na.

  CHAKA
     Ko aka. Kek.

  DANIEL
     We did all this to save you.

  CHAKA
     Aka. Kek.

  DANIEL
     I don't think he ever intended to come with us.

  CHAKA
     Ska nat. Ka keka.

  DANIEL
     He thought he was helping us escape.

  CARTER
     So what does he want to do?

  DANIEL
     Stay and fight and free the others.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, we didn't come here to arm them.

  DANIEL
     Well, they did that themselves. I don't think
     we're going to stop them.

  ANNOTATION
     He offers his zat to Chaka.

  DANIEL
     Ka keka.

  CHAKA
     Ska. Ka kek.

  ANNOTATION
     Chaka takes the zat.

  CHAKA
     A cha'ka.

  DANIEL
     Chaka.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas leave.

  O'NEILL
     You just sent them out to start a war.

  DANIEL
     Well, it was his choice. I told them they didn't
     have to kill.

  O'NEILL
     You think he understands that?

  DANIEL
     They know what freedom is, and they are willing to
     fight for it. They deserve a chance.
