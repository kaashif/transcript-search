<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The Stargate is in the distance. An energy bar has been left on a rock. An Unas, Chaka, comes out of the forest and stalks slowly towards the energy bar, growling. The zoom lens of a video camera is seen half-hidden in the bushes. Chaka picks up the bar, sniffs it, and licks it. He turns suddenly as he hears a noise. He growls, adopting a fighting stance. Four men approach. Chaka looks at the men, then at the energy bar, before reaching out, offering the bar to the men. The leader of the group zats Chaka.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>DANIEL: As you know, over the past year, I have been studying the Unas of P3X-888. I've made some amazing discoveries about their social structure and their culture. I've also been able to categorise almost seventy individual words from their language. But, during a review of the latest batch of digital images, I came across this. (He turns on the tape). These men, whoever they are, abducted the Unas I refer to as Chaka.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>CARTER: That's the one that kidnapped you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>DANIEL: Same one. Their dress indicates preindustrialisation, but they don't seem to have any Jaffa tattoos, so the presence of Goa'uld weapons seems contradictory.</td></tr>
