I used to sit in those chairs and listen to the same boring lectures. No offence, Professor.</td></tr>

These calculations are the key to opening up the entire universe. Wormholes and hyperspace may seem like science fiction, but take my word for it, the future is a lot closer than you might think.</td></tr>
