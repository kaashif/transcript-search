<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mist is rising from the ground. Two soldiers in partial SGC uniforms run through the woods, chased by several native men leaping through the trees. The men are clad in breechclouts with painted faces and bodies. Some are wearing headdresses made from long grass; others have clay helmets that cover their entire head. The men with headdresses have blowguns.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: One of the natives puts his blowpipe to his lips. A dart shoots out and hits Frakes in the shoulder. Frakes falls. Connor runs on, not noticing. Connor reaches the DHD and starts pressing the glyphs for Earth. Frakes stumbles down the path behind him, the arrow still stuck in his shoulder. The natives close in. Frakes pauses, his eyes rolling back. He falls face-first onto the ground. Connor punches in the last symbol and hits the red center of the DHD. The wormhole opens. Connor punches in the code on the GDO. He looks behind him, obviously just noticing that his companion is not with him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Connor looks around at the forest. Frakes falls back to the ground. Looking unhappy, Connor whirls around to run back to the Stargate. Behind him, Frakes pushes himself up, then crumples sideways. He looks up to see himself surrounded by the natives in clay helmets, the men in headdresses right behind them. Another man, this one wearing some kind of robes over an SGC uniform pushes through the crowd, a rifle in hand. Grabbing Frakes' hair, he pulls him into a seated position. Another man, covered from head to foot in a robe, comes out of the crowd to stand before them. Although we can't see his clothing beneath, dogtags catch the light.</td></tr>
