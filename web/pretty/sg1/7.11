<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He is hit by an energy weapon fired from his left. Teal'c and Bra'tac turn and begin to fire their staff weapons. We see a single alien soldier clad all in black, partially in hard armor and partially in black cloth. Its head is complete covered with a helmet. The staff weapons have no effect on it. It raises its left arm as if to fire. Teal'c and Bra'tac drop their weapons and dive for cover as the soldier begins firing a barrage of energy pulses at them. The soldier begins to advance on them, walking slowly. Bra'tac tries to attack it hand-to-hand with his staff weapon but the soldier easily disarms him and throws him to the ground. The soldier begins to advance on Teal'c's position behind cover, firing. Teal'c fires his zat repeatedly at the soldier, at first to no effect, but then the soldier begins to waver, finally falling to the ground, all movement stopped. Teal'c stands, and he and Bra'tac exchange a look of gratitude and confused amazement.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Jacob gives her the forceps. She uses them and a retractor to open the helmet. There is a hissing sound, and some fluid sprays out of the seam. They pull on a gel-like substance and pull off the front of the helmet, revealing the creature's face, which is white and translucent. There is a piece of black equipment still over its nose and mouth. Its eyes are open and a very pale gray.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>CARTER: Looks like he's fused right into the suit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>JACOB: Some sort of breathing filtration system.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Carter pulls off the breathing unit to reveal the warrior's whole face, which looks hardly more solid than gelatin. Carter and Jacob exchange worried looks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Jacob is standing in front of an X-ray of the warrior's head and neck; a Goa'uld symbiote is seen along its spinal column.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>CARTER: It's a Goa'uld. Quite frankly, that's not as shocking as the host.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>HAMMOND: How so?</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>CARTER: It has an incredibly unusual organ structure.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>JACOB: Everything's out of proportion. Physiologically, the heart and lungs had to be abnormally large to supply enough blood and oxygen to its muscles. Basically, it's like someone tried to genetically engineer the perfect athlete without any concern for longevity.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Leaving it to the symbiote to sustain its life.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>DANIELN: An engineered host.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>JACOB: A seriously flawed one. Even a Goa'uld symbiote wouldn't be able to compensate for long. We're still in the process of analyzing genetic data. But for now we can tell you, there was no evident trauma from energy weapons.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>HAMMOND: What does that mean?</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>CARTER: The warrior's armor appears to possess some sort of advanced energy absorption technology. If it works the way I think it does, it wouldn't matter how many staff or zat blasts were fired at it. Nothing would get through.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Are you suggesting that Teal'c and Bra'tac didn't kill this Goa'uld?</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>CARTER: Yes, sir. Apparently, the host was on the verge of a pulmonary failure long before it encountered them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>HAMMOND: It had a heart attack?</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>CARTER: (nodding) Sorry, Teal'c. You didn't stop it. You and Bra'tac just got lucky.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--SGC LABORATORY</td></tr>
<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The warrior is lying on a metal exam table. It is clad in black cloth from head to foot, leaving only its face uncovered. Jacob, Daniel, and Carter are on one side of the table.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>JACOB: Its entire cellular structure is less then three weeks old. It is organic, but it was definitely created in a lab.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, we know the Goa'uld have been trying to physically perfect a host that would be superior to humans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>JACOB: Well this thing's definitely a lot stronger than humans, but it's far from superior.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>DANIEL: Traditionally. the Goa'uld are also somewhat vain about their appearance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>JACOB: This was obviously intended to be a new form of foot soldier. Possibly a reaction to the recent uprising of the Jaffa. What's most interesting is that this being was not alive when it was first grown. It was given life after it reached its mature state.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>DANIEL: Frankenstein's monster.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>CARTER: (to Jacob) How do you know that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>SELMAK: Remnants of a unique energy signature within its cells. It's similar to the residual effects left by the use of a sarcophagus.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>DANIEL: Could it give life to something that wasn't alive in the first place?</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>SELMAK: No. A sarcophagus is designed to boost health and longevity, heal or revive someone terminally injured. They are nowhere near powerful enough to animate non-living cellular matter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>CARTER: Then what could have?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>SELMAK: Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a device originally created by the Ancients. He determined its primary purpose was to heal. But it was so powerful, its effects on human hosts ultimately proved devastating. However, after much research and experimentation, the Goa'uld was able to use the technology to create the first sarcophagus.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>DANIEL: Obviously he wasn't able to eliminate all of its negative side effects.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>SELMAK: The Tok'ra have long sought this device in the hope of using it to perfect the sarcophagus technology, so that we could all benefit from it. Now, it may be the key to fighting this new warrior.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>CARTER: How?</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>SELMAK: With the device, we may be able to devise a weapon to counteract this life-giving energy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>DANIEL: Who was the first Goa'uld to find the device?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>SELMAK: His name was Telchak.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel enters, followed by Jacob and Carter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>DANIEL: (searching for and finding a book on his shelves as he speaks) Nicholas Ballard, my, uh, grandfather... One of Nick's early obsessions was finding the so-called "Fountain of Youth". He claimed he'd found evidence indicating the source of the fountain's power was a piece of alien technology used by early Mayan tribes around 900 B.C. Nick traced its origins to Chac, the Mayan god of rain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>JACOB: And you think this Chac may have actually been Telchak?</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>DANIEL: Just a hunch.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>CARTER: Maybe not just a hunch. The primary function of the device was to heal, right?</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>JACOB: For the Ancients. For humans to see any positive effect, it would be from very limited exposure at a safe distance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>CARTER: Still, if the device was kept hidden near a water source, it could be the basis of the Fountain of Youth mythology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>DANIEL: Nick believed Chac's temple was located somewhere in Central America. He spent decades of his life searching for it but came up empty. I've been over his notes and most of it's indecipherable. The only mention of the temple's location is somewhere near a waterfall and a river.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel hands the thick, old notebook to Jacob. Writing and hand-drawn illustrations can be seen on the pages.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>JACOB: This is written in an obscure dialect of Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>DANIEL: No.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>SELMAK: After Telchak created the sarcophagus, Anubis went to war with him for possession of the original Ancient device.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>DANIEL: And that was long ago, before Anubis attempted to ascend.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>SELMAK: Anubis defeated Telchak, but he never did find the device. It was believed to be hidden in one of Telchak's many temples.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>CARTER: He knew about the technology. While he never actually found the device, he ultimately wouldn't need to.</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>DANIEL: He would have gained access to the knowledge when he ascended. He could've built himself a new one.</td></tr>
