Major Samantha Carter's participation will mark the first inclusion of an alien in loop history. (her image flashes up) A band of explorers happened upon him when his ship the Seberus crashed on an uncharted planet while transporting convicts to the outlying prison colonies. (Pictures of all SG-1, including Jonas, and a picture of the planet are displayed on screen) Now the question on everybody's mind is will these Earthlings bring Warrick luck a second time around?</td></tr>
