Mitchell and Teal'c take cover behind some large pillars. At least four men continue firing. The crowd retreats, followed by the shooters. As one shooter is leaving, his bullets hit a large display case, setting off the museum alarms. This causes metal grated doors to drop into place, sealing off the room. Some of the civilians and security personnel are trapped within the room. One shooter comes around behind Teal'c and is about to shoot him. Mitchell shoots the man once in the lower leg, disabling him. Teal'c turns at the shot and checks the injured guard. Mitchell goes into the hall, seeing one man trying to reload.
