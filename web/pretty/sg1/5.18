<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>KYTANO: My name is Kytano. The once First Prime of Imhotep. A False God! A false god who has died by my own hands. Now, I am free. I am a free Jaffa. If you have come to this place, then you wish to know freedom as I do. If you've come to hear me, then you know in your heart and in your mind that the Goa'uld are not gods.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The crowd of Jaffa cheer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>KYTANO: In time we shall have weapons, and enough food and drink to sustain us for as long as it takes to achieve victory. Until then, we have our freedom. We have our brothers...and sisters. I do not say that this will be easy. There will be sacrifice. But for each of you who dies in the name of freedom, your souls shall be sent to Kheb, the place of freedom everlasting. Until then, if you seek freedom, if you seek sanctuary, know that this place IS sanctuary, this is Cal Mah! I declare this world a free world for all Jaffa! Let no Goa'uld challenge us! The time has come for Jaffa to claim their rightful place among the stars, as warriors who live and as warriors who die...FREE!</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The crowd cheers. In their midst, Bra'tac and Teal'c, in hooded robes, study Kytano and the crowd.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Bra'tac and Teal'c, still in their robes, stand and brief the rest of SG-1 and Hammond, who are seated at the table.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Deliverance? Do you have any idea what happened to the guys in that movie?</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: I do not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel looks up from the report he was reading as Carter shares a sidelong bemused look with him. O'Neill merely motions with his hands in a "never mind" gesture as his joke fell flat.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Master Bra'tac, that's a very strong recommendation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: Yes, it is. Yet the rewards of such an alliance would be great.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Teal'c?</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Many of our allies have fallen, General Hammond. The Tollan may be gone forever, the Tok'ra are severely weakened. Kytano offers an army.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>CARTER: An army that needs our help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Major Carter, have not the Jaffa helped your cause?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>CARTER: Teal'c, please, don't misunderstand me. You and Bra'tac have done more for us than anyone could have asked. I owe you both my life at least a dozen times over. That's not what I'm saying.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>O'NEILL: What she's saying is if this guy's come to us, he's got to be pretty desperate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>DANIEL: Wait a minute, I don't think we should underestimate this opportunity. I mean, an army of Jaffa actually challenging the power structure of the Goa'uld. It could be an inspiration to every Jaffa out there. Word of its very existence is a threat to the Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>CARTER: You don't think the Goa'uld are just going to sit around and let it happen?</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>TEAL'C: We do not. Which makes Kytano's need so great.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: His army is drawn from many different system lords, and more flock to him with each raid he makes. But an army cannot live on courage alone.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Dr. Jackson, what can you tell us about this Imhotep? This is the first I've heard of him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, during the Third Dynasty of ancient Egypt, Imhotep was credited as being THE first pyramid builder. He was later deified among the ancient Egyptians. But, among the Goa'uld, at least as far as I know, he never achieved power of any kind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>HAMMOND: He was never a system lord.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>DANIEL: In fact, I think Imhotep was probably an insignificant Goa'uld from a backwater planet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>CARTER: Which explains how Kytano has managed to survive.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>O'NEILL: He took out a nobody.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>DANIEL: Which probably only buys us some time. If we don't help, the Goa'uld will eventually see this as the threat it really is.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: Imhotep may have been a minor Goa'uld, but Kytano is a great leader of men. I believe him bold enough to lead his rebel army to victory over those who would deny us freedom.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>HAMMOND: I've already ordered food and medical supplies prepared for transport. What we need to discuss in more detail is what kind of weapons and how many.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: Your projectile weapons have proven to be effective in battle.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>O'NEILL: P-90s, MP5s, Spaz 12s.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>HAMMOND: That make take some doing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>TEAL'C: General Hammond, if we may send a smaller number of weapons...as a gesture of good intentions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Hammond looks to O'Neill for input.</td></tr>

Kytano/Imhotep drops his weapon and grabs at the staff impaling him, which Teal'c holds there with all his strength.
