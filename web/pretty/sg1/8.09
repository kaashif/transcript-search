TEASER

LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Daniel are walking side by side down a
     corridor.

  DANIEL
     Teal'c and Bra'tac believe that the only way to
     eliminate all of the System Lords is to recruit as
     many Jaffa into the Fifth Column as possible. Now
     only when their numbers are sufficient would it be
     possible to rise up and unilaterally destroy all
     the Goa'uld at once. Even then, Ba'al controls the
     Super Soldier army, which cannot be turned.

  ANNOTATION
     A voice announces an incoming wormhole as the
     lights and sirens signal.

  DANIEL
     So even if the rebel Jaffa can someday take out
     the majority of the System Lords, there'd still be
     a massive war to fight. The problem is though,
     Ishta doesn't wanna wait. Moloc is continuing to
     order the deaths of all female Jaffa born in his
     domain. And her underground railroad to Haktyl
     can't save them all.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill starts to go down the wrong corridor but
     then turns back and catches up with Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Even now she's organizing a rebellion to overthrow
     Moloc. Now Teal'c and Bra'tac are trying to
     convince her to see the bigger picture.

  O'NEILL
     What was my question again?

  DANEIL
     Um, 'how's it going?'

  O'NEILL
     It seemed so innocuous at the time.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and O'Neill arrive at the Gate room just as
     Teal'c and Bra'tac arrive through the Gate.

  O'NEILL
     Fellas! How was the trip?

  TEAL'C
     I have been betrayed by those I trusted most.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks out of the Gate room.

  O'NEILL
     That good, eh?

  BRA'TAC
     His mood is foul indeed. (nods to Daniel and
     O'Neill) Greetings. It is good to see you both.

  DANIEL
     Bra'tac, what's wrong?

  BRA'TAC
     There was a complication.

  O'NEILL
     Istha?

  BRA'TAC
     She is well, and as lovely as ever, O'Neill. The
     problem I fear lies with Rya'c.

  DANIEL
     Is he okay?

  BRA'TAC
     He is in love, and plans to be married.

  ANNOTATION
     He coughs in disappointment and leaves the O'Neill
     and Daniel standing confused in the Gate room.


LOCATION--SGC RECREATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c are playing ping-pong. O'Neill
     takes a deep breath and prepares to serve.

  O'NEILL
     So when's all this supposed to happen?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill serves and Teal'c returns the ball so hard
     that it hits O'Neill in the left elbow.

  O'NEILL
     Ow!

  TEAL'C
     Three days.

  O'NEILL
     Three days, huh? That's kinda quick.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  O'NEILL
     Well, you know love...is a strange and
     mysterious...thing.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill serves again, and Teal'c hits it back,
     nailing O'Neill in the right thigh.

  O'NEILL
     Ow! God.

  TEAL'C
     Rya'c did not even consult me before making his
     decision. It is obvious this girl has caused all
     reason to leave Rya'c's head.

  O'NEILL
     (preparing to serve) Zero serving three.

  TEAL'C
     Serving eight.

  O'NEILL
     Eight.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill serves again, and Teal'c's returned ball
     hits O'Neill again, apparently in a sensitive
     spot.

  O'NEILL
     Ah! (in a high voice for a moment) So what's Ishta
     think of all this?

  TEAL'C
     Ishta believes that tradition should persist at
     all costs, especially in the face of oppression.

  O'NEILL
     I see.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c serves the ping-pong ball and it goes right
     by O'Neill.

  TEAL'C
     Rya'c is too young to know what love is, O'Neill,
     or how it inevitably weakens a warrior's resolve.

  O'NEILL
     Look, T, I'm not gonna tell you how to raise your
     kid, but I've always found that sticking your
     fingers in your ears and humming loudly solves a
     whole slew of problems.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles at him.

  TEAL'C
     What good am I as a father, O'Neill, if I cannot
     keep my son from making this crucial mistake.

  ANNOTATION
     A voice announces an unscheduled off-world
     activation, and the lights and sirens go off.
     Teal'c walks away from his side of the ping-pong
     table, and O'Neill serves the ball to the empty
     table.

  O'NEILL
     Got one.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Technician Harriman is at the controls. O'Neill
     and Teal'c enter.

  TECHNICIAN
     Receiving IDC, sir. It's Ishta.

  O'NEILL
     Open the iris.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens. O'Neill and Teal'c go down the
     stairs to the Gate room. O'Neill muscles Teal'c
     aside so that he enters first, giving Teal'c a
     'respect my authority' look. Ishta and another
     female Jaffa come through the wormhole and down
     the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Greetings.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa women bow their heads in greeting, as
     does Teal'c.

  ISHTA
     There is an urgent matter we must discuss. Haktyl
     may have been compromised.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, O'Neill, and the visiting Jaffa are seated
     at the table.

  DANIEL
     How do you know?

  ISHTA
     Yesterday, we were to meet one of our contacts. A
     High Priestess stationed within Moloc's temple.
     She failed to appear at the allotted time.

  TEAL'C
     You must evacuate immediately.

  ISHTA
     I agree. But we know not of another unihabited
     planet like Haktyl. Hiding a large group of female
     warriors and children within a populated planet in
     Moloc's domain is difficult and dangerous.

  O'NEILL
     Well, I'm sure we could help you folks out.
     Carter?

  CARTER
     Uh, no problem. We have a number of possible
     worlds on record, but they should be explored more
     thoroughly before you take up permanent residence.

  ISHTA
     If Moloc is aware of our location, every moment my
     people remain on Haktyl puts them at greater risk.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks at O'Neill, who nods, and then everyone
     looks expectantly at him. He finally realizes what
     they are not asking.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, um, you're welcome to stay here. I'll go start
     the paperwork.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the room while the others look at
     each other, worried.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole is open. The female Jaffa warriors
     and young girls are coming through in their rustic
     clothing, carrying their belongings. There are
     also horses laden with packages or people. Daniel
     and Carter are watching, and Rya'c and a young
     woman come through.

  RYA'C
     Colonel Carter, Doctor Jackson!

  CARTER
     Rya'c, it's good to see you again.

  RYA'C
     This is my simka, Kar'yn.

  KAR'YN
     (smiling) Rya'c, stop using those old terms. We
     are betrothed. And it is an honor to meet friends
     of my husband to be.

  DANIEL
     (smiling) Right back atcha.

  RYA'C
     Is she not the most beautiful thing you've ever
     seen?

  KAR'YN
     (annoyed) Stop it. You're embarrassing me. I'm not
     an object to be worshipped.

  RYA'C
     (moving past the awkward moment) Thank you for
     agreeing to host our union ceremony. It will be an
     honor to be betrothed among friends.

  DANIEL
     (surprised) Oh, you're going to have the wedding
     here?

  KAR'YN
     Of course. Ishta said it may take some time to
     find a suitable planet for our new home. We are to
     be married in three days.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Carter give big fake smiles to hide
     their horror. Daniel puts his hand on Carter's far
     shoulder, and she puts her hand over his.

  KAR'YN
     There is much to do. Rya'c?

  ANNOTATION
     She is pulling him by the hand.

  RYA'C
     Excuse us.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave. Carter taps her finger against
     Daniel's hand where it rests on her shoulder. They
     continue their fake smiles.

  DANIEL
     They're having the wedding here.

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  DANIEL
     Does Jack know about this?

  CARTER
     I'm gonna work on finding them a planet. Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods. She leaves.


LOCATION--GENERAL O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is seated at his desk, writing in an open
     folder. Bra'tac appears in the doorway and knocks.
     O'Neill doesn't look up.

  O'NEILL
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks up.

  O'NEILL
     (surprised) Bra'tac.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac enters, smiling.

  O'NEILL
     What's that smell?

  BRA'TAC
     I believe that is the horses, O'Neill. The
     warriors of Haktyl are grateful for you
     generosity.

  O'NEILL
     Well, you know me. Always willing to help those
     who...need help.

  BRA'TAC
     You are indeed a wise and gracious leader, O'Neill
     of Minnesota.

  O'NEILL
     (realizing Bra'tac is playing him) Sit down, you
     old coot.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac sits on the other side of the desk.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  BRA'TAC
     I am to officiate at the Rite of Everlasting Union
     between Rya'c and Kar'yn. I have consulted with
     Ishta in the matter, and despite the evacuation of
     Haktyl, she wishes the wedding to proceed as
     planned, and as scheduled.

  O'NEILL
     Meaning, here?

  BRA'TAC
     A more suitable world is not likely to be found in
     time. Delaying the ceremony would only grant
     another victory to Moloc's tyranny.

  O'NEILL
     You know what it took to get approval for
     'Tailgate Tuesdays,' huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac looks confused.

  O'NEILL
     There'll be cake?

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac smiles and laughs.


LOCATION--ISHTA'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Ishta is in a VIP room decorated with candles,
     which she is arranging. Teal'c enters without
     knocking and closes the door.

  TEAL'C
     You have been avoiding me.

  ANNOTATION
     She stands but doesn't face him.

  ISHTA
     You have indicated I am not worthy of your
     presence.

  TEAL'C
     How so?

  ISHTA
     Your refusal to bless this union is an insult to
     Kar'yn and thus to me.

  TEAL'C
     That is not what I intended. Rya'c has pledged to
     help lead the Jaffa in the battle against the
     Goa'uld.

  ISHTA
     As have I, and my people. A warrior is always
     stronger with another at his side. So you must
     believe Kar'yn to be an unworthy warrior. And I am
     at fault as her teacher.

  TEAL'C
     Ishta, this is not about you. Soon enough Rya'c
     will have to choose between his responsibility to
     his family and to that of his cause, just as I
     once did. I merely believe that he is young and
     has much time ahead, and need not undertake such a
     decision so soon.

  ISHTA
     In the same way Rya'c had no say in your decision,
     you have no say in his. None of us choose
     oppression at the hand of the Goa'uld, nor what
     must be done to free ourselves of it. But we must
     not sacrifice that which makes us Jaffa. I have
     organized both men and women to fight together, to
     rise up against Moloc. Maybe once we are free of
     his tyranny, you will see that we are worthy of
     your war.

  TEAL'C
     Overthrowing Moloc alone will ultimately prove
     nothing. Were he to fall, his worlds and armies
     will simply be usurped by another Goa'uld.

  ISHTA
     (nearly shouting) I will not stand idly by and
     watch more of my sisters slain at the hand of
     Moloc, while you and the leaders of this so called
     Jaffa rebellion, you plot and you scheme and you
     ultimately do nothing.

  TEAL'C
     You have no wish to fight side by side--only to
     control and dominate.

  ISHTA
     As my sisters have been for generations.

  TEAL'C
     As you will continue to be because of your
     short-sightedness.

  ISHTA
     I will not rest until Moloc is dead!

  TEAL'C
     (very angry) I will not rest until all Goa'uld are
     dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leaves the room.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter enter the corridor from a door
     as a female Jaffa walks by. O'Neill grabs Carter
     by the arm.

  O'NEILL
     They want a what?

  CARTER
     A goat, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin walking down the corridor.

  O'NEILL
     You can tell them lamb is far less gamey.

  CARTER
     They want it for a ritual sacrifice.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, well you can tell them that's not gonna
     happen.

  ANNOTATION
     They pass some female children playing a game next
     to a wall.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I was hoping you'd say that.

  O'NEILL
     They can have a piata. That's always fun.

  CARTER
     I'll suggest it, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A horse is led past them. O'Neill pushes at its
     backside in irritation as it passes by. With the
     horse continuing down the hall behind them,
     O'Neill grabs Carter by the shoulders.

  O'NEILL
     Please tell me you're close to finding a planet.

  CARTER
     We scouted one yesterday that Ishta seems
     comfortable with. Fresh water, stable climate...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill realizes his hands are still on Carter and
     awkwardly releases her.

  O'NEILL
     Good. When's moving day.

  CARTER
     Istha thinks it'll take about a week to get a
     livable camp going.

  O'NEILL
     (dismayed) A week?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir. The wedding is still gonna happen.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grabs O'Neill and turns him after he is
     distracted by a passing female Jaffa.

  O'NEILL
     Have you seen Teal'c?

  CARTER
     I think he's locked himself in his room.

  O'NEILL
     That chicken.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac is presiding over the rehearsal of the
     wedding, with Rya'c and Kar'yn standing to each
     side of table with a burning lamp, facing each
     other.

  BRA'TAC
     Let this fire bear witness to this ceremony. May
     its flames keep warm the souls of those who came
     before us. We ask those spirits now to bless this
     union and to protect it through each day of its
     existence. And then the horn will sound.

  ANNOTATION
     A horn sounds two notes.

  BRA'TAC
     Good. Now, (to Rya'c) you'll place the circle of
     fidelity upon Kar'yn's head.

  ANNOTATION
     Rya'c places a circlet of leaves and pine cones on
     her head.

  BRA'TAC
     (to Kar'yn) And you the totem of bravery around
     Rya'c's neck.

  ANNOTATION
     Kar'yn places a necklace around Rya'c's neck.

  BRA'TAC
     The bride will then kneel before her husband in
     respect.

  KAR'YN
     (horrified) I will do no such thing.

  RYA'C
     Kar'yn!

  KAR'YN
     I kneel before no man, not even my husband!

  BRA'TAC
     This action has been part of the ceremony for
     thousands--

  KAR'YN
     Then he should kneel before me as well! Or am I
     too weak to have such respect given to me in
     return?

  RYA'C
     (embarrassed) You disgrace my name.

  BRA'TAC
     (desperate) Perhaps if we took a short recess...

  KAR'YN
     And if you insist on treating me like a fragile
     hand maiden, then I have chosen poorly for a
     husband!

  RYA'C
     Well, perhaps I have chosen poorly as well!

  ANNOTATION
     Kar'yn rips off her circlet and storms out,
     followed by her fellow female Jaffa. Teal'c
     observes from the control room and smiles. Rya'c
     removes his necklace and hands it to Bra'tac.
     Bra'tac takes a sip from a goblet.

  BRA'TAC
     I can see why one must rehearse these events.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate begins to activate.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  TECHNICIAN
     Unscheduled off-world activation! (to Teal'c)
     Receiving a message. On screen.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c activates the screen as Ishta and Bra'tac
     enter.

  TEAL'C
     Ishta, this concerns you.

  ISHTA
     It's from one of my contacts among Moloc's Jaffa.
     He's requesting a summit.

  TEAL'C
     For what reason?

  ISHTA
     Our forces that are hiding among the Jaffa of
     Moloc have become large, but there are still many
     who are loyal to him. We risk being exposed. We
     must send the coordinates of the new home world to
     those who will attend.

  TEAL'C
     Very well. I will accompany you to this summit.

  ISHTA
     You have no say in our matters.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps there is council I can provide.

  ISHTA
     You will abide by my ruling.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c exchanges a look with Bra'tac and then bows
     his head to Ishta.


LOCATION--ISHTA'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Ishta is packing while Kar'yn looks on.

  KAR'YN
     Can I come with you?

  ISHTA
     Do not be foolish. You have a union to prepare
     for.

  KAR'YN
     There will be no union.

  ISHTA
     Kar'yn, you must learn not to let your emotions
     take you to such extremes.

  KAR'YN
     I cannot be betrothed to Rya'c. He is as pigheaded
     as his father.

  ISHTA
     (taking her chin, angry) Until you have fought as
     many battles, do not speak of Teal'c of Chulak
     with such disrespect. Without him, we would not
     have Tretonin, and we'd still be slaves to the
     Goa'uld symbiotes.

  KAR'YN
     But how can you accept his affection knowing he
     does not support our war against Moloc and the
     archaic traditions that oppress female Jaffa?

  ISHTA
     We differ often, but deep down we both possess the
     same hunger for freedom.

  KAR'YN
     Does he not see me fit for Rya'c?

  ISHTA
     He could search a thousand worlds and never find
     someone like you. Teal'c has sacrificed much in
     the war against the Goa'uld and does not wish
     Rya'c to feel the pain of such loss.

  KAR'YN
     What about Rya'c? He does not respect me as a
     warrior as Teal'c respects you.

  ISHTA
     That took some convincing, believe me. What you
     must remember is that as much as you desire
     Rya'c's respect, he too burns for yours.


LOCATION--SGC TRAINING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Rya'c is working out, practicing with a long,
     slender wooden pole as a substitute for a staff
     weapon. Bra'tac enters and grabs the center of the
     pole just as Rya'c is swinging it past.

  BRA'TAC
     Your parries are too low. Hold your staff higher.
     Step into each blocking blow.

  RYA'C
     Leave me be.

  BRA'TAC
     As you wish.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac turns and begins walking toward the door.

  RYA'C
     Have I not been a dutiful son? Have I not brought
     honor to my name?

  BRA'TAC
     You have indeed.

  RYA'C
     They why will my father not bless my union with
     Kar'yn?

  BRA'TAC
     Then the union is still to be?

  RYA'C
     That is not the point.

  BRA'TAC
     You have made a choice. You pledged your life to
     fight for freedom for all Jaffa. It is a war you
     must commit to without question.

  RYA'C
     I know! That is why my father abandoned my mother
     and I. Because we made him weak.

  ANNOTATION
     Rya'c pounds the end of the pole into the ground
     in anger.

  BRA'TAC
     That is not true.

  RYA'C
     He knows I forgave him for that long ago. I
     understand why it was necessary.

  BRA'TAC
     Do you, hmm? Teal'c stayed First Prime of Apophis
     as long as he did because he feared for you. He
     committed atrocities in the name of the Goa'uld
     because he wanted you and your mother to be safe.
     When he chose to leave, to join the Tau'ri, it was
     the most difficult thing he has ever done. It is
     not you that made him weak, but his own fear and
     doubt. When he realized the Goa'uld could indeed
     be defeated, that if he fought hard enough, you
     could one day be free, it made him stronger.

  RYA'C
     It is the same for me with Kar'yn. She fuels my
     desire to fight for freedom. We know what we must
     face, and we choose to do it together.

  BRA'TAC
     You still have much to learn about yourself, about
     being a warrior. And neither of you truly know
     what we will all face in full scale war with the
     Goa'uld.

  RYA'C
     I do not need his blessing.

  BRA'TAC
     (angry) No, you do not.

  RYA'C
     And he insults Kar'yn. She is a formidable warrior
     who deserves his respect.

  BRA'TAC
     And yours.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac leaves.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET FOUND BY SGC, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Moloc's Jaffa, now rebels, are meeting in a tent.
     Teal'c and Ishta are there.


LOCATION--MEETING TENT

  ARON
     The ranks of rebel Jaffa are sizable enough to
     win. The time to strike is now.

  COR'AK
     Aron is right. If we wait much longer, it is only
     a matter of time before our numbers grow too large
     for Moloc not to discover. We risk losing
     everything.

  ISHTA
     Aron is right. We must strike now!

  TEAL'C
     Jaffa! Hear me! I know your hearts are prepared
     for battle, but I have come to ask for your
     patience. You have prepared well for the demise of
     Moloc, but only when all Jaffa rise up as one can
     the Goa'uld be defeated. And only then will all of
     our brothers and sisters truly be free.

  ISHTA
     (incredulous) This is the council you have come to
     offer?

  ANNOTATION
     They are alerted by some sort of disturbance
     outside.

  ISHTA
     What is it?

  TEAL'C
     Down!

  ANNOTATION
     They all hit the ground as the group comes under
     attack from Jaffa with staff weapons who have
     surrounded the tent. Nearly all of the rebel Jaffa
     are hit. Teal'c, Ishta, and Aron escape out the
     back and down into a gully. They make their way to
     a ridge overlooking the Gate, where they see many
     Jaffa loyal to Moloc guarding it.


LOCATION--NEAR STARGATE ON NEW PLANET, DAY

  TEAL'C
     The Gate is well guarded.

  ISHTA
     We must return to the meeting tent. If anyone else
     survived, they will be tortured.

  TEAL'C
     Wait.

  ARON
     For what?

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate opens. The Jaffa aim their weapons at it.
     A voice comes through on Teal'c's radio.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c? You there?

  TEAL'C
     Proceed, O'Neill.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is standing at the control console.

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) You know how I get when you
     don't call.


LOCATION--NEAR THE STARGATE ON NEW PLANET, DAY

  TEAL'C
     Moloc's Jaffa ambushed the summit. The address of
     the planet must have fallen into the wrong hands.
     I am with Ishta and another rebel Jaffa named
     Aron. At present we are cut off from the Gate.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  O'NEILL
     How bad?

  TEAL'C
     (over speaker) Very.

  O'NEILL
     Back-up?


LOCATION--NEAR THE STARGATE ON NEW PLANET, DAY

  TEAL'C
     It would be unwise at the moment. I am uncertain
     as to the extent of forces or if there are ships
     in orbit. I will need time to gather intel before
     deciding on a course of action.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  O'NEILL
     All right. I'll check in in about an hour. And T?


LOCATION--NEAR THE STARGATE ON NEW PLANET, DAY

  TEAL'C
     My head is down, O'Neill.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  O'NEILL
     Over.


LOCATION--NEAR THE STARGATE ON NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The three get up from the their overlook and
     retreat into the woods. Teal'c grabs Ishta by the
     arm.

  TEAL'C
     Someone from within your camp has betrayed you.
     That can be the only explanation for Moloc's
     presence here.

  ISHTA
     (panicked) Teal'c, I do not have my Tretonin. It
     was in my pack, and in our haste I left it in the
     tent.

  TEAL'C
     I have enough for both of us.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls his Tretonin cylinder from his pocket but
     finds that it is broken.

  ISHTA
     It must have shattered when you fell to the
     ground.

  ARON
     We must move. A search patrol approaches.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     There is a total cacophony of voices as Daniel
     tries to reason with the female Jaffa and Rya'c,
     who are all arguing about something. Bra'tac and
     O'Neill enter. O'Neill tries to call for everyone
     to settle down but no one is listening. Bra'tac
     pushes past him.

  BRA'TAC
     (shouting) Silence!

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone stops talking.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you. Now, Daniel, what's going on here?

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone starts talking over each other before
     Daniel can say anything.

  BRA'TAC
     Silence!

  O'NEILL
     I said, 'Daniel.'

  DANIEL
     Well, as you can see, everyone's a little upset.

  KA'LEL
     We will not abandon Ishta. We insist a rescue
     mission be devised immediately.

  O'NEILL
     We're devising.

  BRA'TAC
     Teal'c has said the Gate is well guarded.

  RYA'C
     Can we not acquire a ship and journey to this
     planet?

  DANIEL
     Even if we could, it would take at least a week to
     get there.

  BRA'TAC
     Please, return to your quarters.

  KAR'YN
     I cannot go until--

  BRA'TAC
     (raising his voice) Please! In time, your skills
     may be required, and you must be ready. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa begin to leave the briefing room.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Ishta, and Aron are lying on the ground
     and looking at the tent.

  ARON
     There are only six.

  TEAL'C
     We do not know how many more may be hiding nearby,
     anticipating our approach.

  ANNOTATION
     A male voice is heard screaming in agony from the
     tent.

  ISHTA
     We must do something. I cannot bear this. The
     Tau'ri have troops and weapons.

  TEAL'C
     We have not determined the size of Moloc's forces
     they would face. Many more lives than our own
     could be lost.

  ISHTA
     Then what are we to do?

  TEAL'C
     For the moment, nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     They get up and move into the woods. Ishta
     stumbles and grabs a tree for support. Aron is
     unaware and continues walking.

  ARON
     We cannot hide forever from their patrols.

  TEAL'C
     We will rest here.

  ARON
     They will not rest until we are found.

  ANNOTATION
     Ishta sits down weakly, and Teal'c joins her.

  ARON
     If your plan is to rest until they give up and
     leave--

  TEAL'C
     I merely need to gather the information that I can
     concerning the forces against us.

  ARON
     We are severly outnumbered. What more do you need
     to know?

  ISHTA
     Aron, I need to speak to Teal'c privately.

  ARON
     You do not trust my loyalty.

  ISHTA
     I do. This is a private matter. Please.

  ANNOTATION
     Aron walks away.

  TEAL'C
     He could be the informant as easily as anyone and
     using this opportunity to gather knowledge
     concerning the rebellion.

  ISHTA
     I know. But he is right about one thing: we cannot
     wait to act. I am already growing weak.

  TEAL'C
     You need rest.

  ISHTA
     (insulted) As do you.

  TEAL'C
     (smiling) I will take first watch.

  ISHTA
     Teal'c, I promised all Jaffa under Moloc's rule,
     they will be free from his tyranny.

  TEAL'C
     It was not a foolish promise. One day, we will all
     be free.

  ISHTA
     'One day' is not soon enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c stands and walks away to go take his watch.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is sleeping sitting up against a tree. Aron
     runs up to him, kneels down, and wakes him.

  ARON
     Where is Ishta?

  TEAL'C
     It was her turn to take wa--

  ANNOTATION
     Realizing she is gone, he leaps up and they run
     off together. They arrive at the overlook to the
     tent in time to see some Jaffa dragging Ishta
     inside.


LOCATION--TENT

  ANNOTATION
     A man in a metal uniform turns around to face
     Ishta, who looks terrified. His eyes glow: it is
     Moloc.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, OUTSIDE THE TENT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Aron are watching the tent from the
     woods. They hear someone shout 'Moloc.'

  TEAL'C
     Moloc is here.

  ANNOTATION
     They get up and move back into the woods and
     continue walking quickly.

  ARON
     We must act.

  TEAL'C
     I am aware.

  ARON
     Even if Ishta cannot be saved, we must take the
     opportunity to kill Moloc.

  TEAL'C
     That is not my goal.

  ARON
     It is mine, and that of all the Jaffa who have
     joined in rebellion against him.

  TEAL'C
     Without reinforcements, we will be swarmed by
     Moloc's forces.

  ARON
     I am willing to die for my cause.

  TEAL'C
     Then you will die for nothing if you do not
     succeed in killing Moloc first.

  ARON
     You are weak, and your mind is clouded with
     feelings for Ishta.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c zats Aron, who was walking ahead of him.

  TEAL'C
     And you cannot be trusted.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c takes Aron's staff weapon and continues on.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac arrives through the gate in full uniform,
     with his staff weapon. Daniel is waiting for him.

  DANIEL
     Ishta's been captured. And apparently Moloc is
     there in person. Now we're gonna coordinate a
     missile attack on the Jaffa at the Gate to provide
     a distraction for Teal'c's rescue attempt.

  BRA'TAC
     Moloc will certainly kill her before surrendering.

  DANIEL
     Well, Teal'c's more worried about what he's going
     to do to her in the meantime.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk out of the Gate room.


LOCATION--TENT ON NEW PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Moloc is using the ribbon device to torture Ishta.
     He drives her to the ground and turns off the
     device.

  MOLOC
     It is not too late to repent for your sins. Grovel
     before your God, and beg for my forgiveness.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets back to her knees and gives him a defiant
     look.

  MOLOC
     Tell me of the other sinners who would betray me.
     How many would renounce the privilege of carrying
     the children of their God, like you? Tell me while
     their souls may yet be saved!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa drag her to her feet; she is defiant and
     doesn't say anything.

  MOLOC
     You cannot be Ishta of the Haktyl! Wicked leader
     of the depraved! I sense nothing but weakness in
     you. Well maybe that is what happens when you
     abandon the strength of the Goa'uld inside of you.
     All that is left is this burning desire to die at
     the hands of your great and powerful God.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns the ribbon device on, aiming it at her
     forehead again.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel are there talking to O'Neill and
     Bra'tac.

  CARTER
     We're preparing a UAV to drop Tretonin for Teal'c.

  BRA'TAC
     He will need all his strength if he is to rescue
     Ishta from the clutches of Moloc.

  CARTER
     The UAV will then circle back and paint the
     targets on the Gate.

  BRA'TAC
     Ishta did not exaggerate. The rebel Jaffa on
     Moloc's worlds are indeed a mighty force. As we
     speak, they prepare for war against those still
     loyal to Moloc.

  O'NEILL
     You think they can win?

  BRATAC
     I do not know.

  CARTER
     Even if they do, it's possible another Goa'uld
     could simply take his place. Or worse, come in and
     wipe them all out to prove this whole rebellion is
     a bad idea.

  BRATAC
     Indeed. That is something we asked them to
     consider. And yet, such reason is beyond them now.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Siler is working with the UAV on its launching
     catapult.

  SILER
     UAV ready to launch, Colonel.

  CARTER
     (from the Control Room) Okay, Sergeant. (to
     Technician) Dial the Gate.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate begins to activate. The Jaffa on the
     planet see the ring begin to move and prepare to
     fight whoever comes through. At the SGC, the Gate
     whooshes open.

  CARTER
     Launching UAV in three...two...one...

  ANNOTATION
     The UAV is catapulted through the Gate.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The UAV comes through very quickly. The Jaffa
     watch it head away. Teal'c sees it also.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Daniel, Bra'tac and others are watching
     the UAV terrain graphics feed on a monitor.

  CARTER
     Receiving Teal'c's radio signal.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The UAV is hit on the right wing by a staff blast
     and begins to go down.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  CARTER
     The UAV's been hit.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c sees the UAV go down over a hill.

  CARTER
     (via radio) Teal'c, do you copy?

  TEAL'C
     (into radio) Proceed.

  CARTER
     The UAV should be half a click south-west of your
     location.

  TEAL'C
     I am on my way.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  CARTER
     Careful, Teal'c. We'll dial back in 30 minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate shuts down.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c heads toward the downed UAV.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  BRA'TAC
     Can we not still send the missiles through?

  CARTER
     Without a laser-painted target, they'd just fly
     out their fuel and crash.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c comes upon the UAV, which is burning and in
     pieces. Moving desperately, he finds the door with
     the Tretonin inside, though he burns his fingers.
     He pulls out the cartridge, but before he can
     inject himself Moloc's Jaffa come upon him.

  JAFFA
     Jaffa, Shel-na-kree! Kree noc Jaffa!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c manages to hide the Tretonin cartridge in
     his vest pocket before standing up and turning
     around to face the Jaffa.

  TEAL'C
     Shel-kek-nem-ron. If you know who I am, brothers,
     you know that there is no need to sacrifice your
     lives for a false god.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa walks over and slams Teal'c in the
     stomach with his staff weapon.

  JAFFA
     Re-nok-Sholva!

  ANNOTATION
     Aron attacks a Jaffa from behind, takes his staff
     weapon, and begins firing. Teal'c joins in and
     they take out all of them. Teal'c falls to the
     ground and injects himself with Tretonin.

  ARON
     It would have been easier, had you left me with a
     weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c gets up and grasps his arm.

  TEAL'C
     My thanks.

  ARON
     Is there anything else I can do to prove my
     loyalty?

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.


LOCATION--TENT ON NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Ishta is lying on the ground, semi-conscious. Her
     gaze goes to her pack. Moloc is watching and pulls
     the Tretonin out of the pack.

  MOLOC
     Is this what you want? Evil serum to poison you
     further? Or will it give you strength enough to
     last a little longer? Then take it. Take it so
     that you may have more precious time with your
     God.

  ANNOTATION
     He drops the Tretonin onto the floor beside her.
     Two Jaffa enter the tent.

  JAFFA
     My Lord, word comes from Goranak. An uprising has
     begun. An army of two thousand is marching on your
     temple. They control a garrison of gliders and
     several Alkesh.

  MOLOC
     As I have foreseen.

  JAFFA
     Your fleet of Ha'tak have gathered themselves in
     orbit. They await your command to crush this
     insolence.

  MOLOC
     (looking at Ishta) I am done with this one.
     Trivial as it may seem, this little distraction
     has given me a few moments of pleasure. Use her to
     capture the Sholva, Teal'c. Then bring him to me.

  JAFFA
     Yes, My Lord.

  ANNOTATION
     Moloc leaves the tent. Ishta picks up the Tretonin
     canister.


LOCATION--NEAR GATE OF NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Aron are there watching the Jaffa
     guarding the Gate.

  TEAL'C
     (showing him a mini laser sight) When the Gate
     opens again, aim this at your target. The missiles
     will come through and strike where you aim.

  ARON
     You're certain your strength has sufficiently
     returned. This time I will not be there to come to
     your rescue.

  TEAL'C
     I assure you, this time it will not be necessary.

  ANNOTATION
     Moloc strides up to the Gate with a Jaffa
     entourage.

  MOLOC
     Open the Chappa'ai!

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa begins to do so but before he can finish
     dialing, the Gates wooshes open. The Jaffa assume
     battle stances.

  MOLOC
     Jaffa, kree-nok!


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Daniel, and Bra'tac are there. The blast
     doors are closing on the control room.

  CARTER
     Teal'c, this is Carter, do you read?


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter, I am ready and in position.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  CARTER
     So, we're on?


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pushes a red button and two missiles lower
     into position.


LOCATION--NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is running with two staff weapons lashed
     together with their ends opposite each other so he
     can fire in two directions at once. He shoots many
     Jaffa. He finally arrives at the tent where Ishta
     is being held. He tosses down his double staff.


LOCATION--NEAR GATE OF NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The two missiles come through the Gate.


LOCATION--TENT ON NEW PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c enters, Zat at the ready, to find a Jaffa
     is holding Ishta and pressing a knife to her neck.

  JAFFA
     She is weak to the point of death. Zatting us
     both, even once, will kill her. Drop your weapon.


LOCATION--NEAR GATE OF NEW PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The missiles curve upward to the top of their
     trajectories and then turn back toward the Gate.

  MOLOC
     Shoot them now!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa begin firing everything they have at the
     missiles. Aron points the laser sight right at
     Moloc's chest. Moloc sees it and tries to flick it
     away. He realizes what it is just as the missiles
     are about to take him out.


LOCATION--TENT ON NEW PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     A great explosion is heard outside. The Jaffa
     still has Ishta.

  JAFFA
     Drop it now!

  ANNOTATION
     More explosions are heard.

  TEAL'C
     That is the sound of your false god dying.

  JAFFA
     Gods cannot be killed.

  ISHTA
     (weakly) Teal'c.

  JAFFA
     Not another word.

  ISHTA
     Shoot!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c shoots them both with a single Zat charge.
     He further knocks the Jaffa out. He kneels next to
     Ishta and starts to pull out his Tretonin
     cartridge for her.

  ISHTA
     There is no need. I have taken mine. Is it true
     that Moloc is dead?

  TEAL'C
     If you have the strength, we can see for
     ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     She collapses against him and he holds her.

  ISHTA
     In a moment.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wedding of Rya'c and Kar'yn is underway,
     presided over by Bra'tac. O'Neill and Carter are
     there in their dress uniforms, Daniel in a suit,
     Teal'c in his robes. They are there with other SGC
     personnel and the female Jaffa.

  BRA'TAC
     Kar'yn, speak of your love and devotion to Rya'c.

  KAR'YN
     Rya'c, your heart is pure and your spirit strong.
     You give me strength and joy, and I will stand by
     your side, always.

  BRA'TAC
     Rya'c.

  RYA'C
     Kar'yn, you are as beautiful as the Sun. My love
     for you is like the morning rays that dawn over an
     endless day.

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac joins their hands together.

  BRA'TAC
     The rite is complete. May you love and fight like
     warriors. Just not with each other.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone laughs and applauds as the couple kisses.
     Teal'c and Ishta gaze at each other.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Rya'c are walking and talking.

  RYA'C
     A legend speaks of a place, near where the
     mountains meets the sea, of hidden pools beneath
     majestic waterfalls.

  TEAL'C
     It is no legend. I have seen it with my own eyes.
     You have chosen the location for your Shimroa very
     well.

  RYA'C
     Master Bra'tac said this is where you took my
     mother.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. Ry'ac, I can think of no better mate for
     you than Kar'yn, and I am certain your mother
     would have felt the same.

  RYA'C
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     They clasp shoulders and then hug.

  TEAL'C
     Before your departure, there is a matter that
     bears discussion.

  RYA'C
     Father, I am aware of the ways between a man and a
     woman.

  TEAL'C
     Good. Then you are prepared for the Rite of Ornoc.

  RYA'C
     Surely it is not still expected.

  TEAL'C
     On the first Eve of Shimroa. My advice is that the
     knife be as sharp as possible.

  RYA'C
     Perhaps Kar'yn is right. Not all of the old
     traditions are worth holding onto.

  ANNOTATION
     They laugh lightly.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  RYA'C
     And what of you and Ishta?

  TEAL'C
     What of us?

  RYA'C
     Well, your relationship would be much easier if
     you'd both admit you are in love. For us all.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps one day, when I am as wise as you.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the Gate room. Ishta and the other
     women are there, with O'Neill. The women are
     leaving through the open wormhole.

  ISHTA
     Once again we owe you our thanks for your
     hospitality, and for helping us find yet another
     new homeworld, where the children of the Haktyl
     may be safe.

  O'NEILL
     (smiling) Think nothing of it. You sure you got
     everything? Didn't forget any kids or horses?

  ISHTA
     (smiling) May I speak with Teal'c alone?

  O'NEILL
     Sure. It was good to see you again.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves.

  RYA'C
     I will see you soon, Father.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c hugs Rya'c and Kar'yn.

  KAR'YN
     Yes, Father.

  TEAL'C
     Be well.

  ANNOTATION
     Rya'c and Kar'yn walk up the ramp to leave.

  ISHTA
     I did not wish to spoil the days of Shimroa for
     Ry'ac and Kar'yn.

  TEAL'C
     What have you discovered?

  ISHTA
     As you predicted, another Goa'uld has claimed the
     domain of Moloc.

  TEAL'C
     Ba'al.

  ISHTA
     Yes. Do not wait too long to visit. We have a war
     to plan, among other things.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Ishta kiss. She walks up the ramp and
     joins two female Jaffa, and they leave through the
     Gate.
