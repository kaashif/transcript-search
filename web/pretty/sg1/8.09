<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill and Daniel are walking side by side down a corridor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>DANIEL: Teal'c and Bra'tac believe that the only way to eliminate all of the System Lords is to recruit as many Jaffa into the Fifth Column as possible. Now only when their numbers are sufficient would it be possible to rise up and unilaterally destroy all the Goa'uld at once. Even then, Ba'al controls the Super Soldier army, which cannot be turned.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: A voice announces an incoming wormhole as the lights and sirens signal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>DANIEL: So even if the rebel Jaffa can someday take out the majority of the System Lords, there'd still be a massive war to fight. The problem is though, Ishta doesn't wanna wait. Moloc is continuing to order the deaths of all female Jaffa born in his domain. And her underground railroad to Haktyl can't save them all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill starts to go down the wrong corridor but then turns back and catches up with Daniel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>DANIEL: Even now she's organizing a rebellion to overthrow Moloc. Now Teal'c and Bra'tac are trying to convince her to see the bigger picture.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Rya'c did not even consult me before making his decision. It is obvious this girl has caused all reason to leave Rya'c's head.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Rya'c is too young to know what love is, O'Neill, or how it inevitably weakens a warrior's resolve.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Look, T, I'm not gonna tell you how to raise your kid, but I've always found that sticking your fingers in your ears and humming loudly solves a whole slew of problems.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: A voice announces an unscheduled off-world activation, and the lights and sirens go off. Teal'c walks away from his side of the ping-pong table, and O'Neill serves the ball to the empty table.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The iris opens. O'Neill and Teal'c go down the stairs to the Gate room. O'Neill muscles Teal'c aside so that he enters first, giving Teal'c a 'respect my authority' look. Ishta and another female Jaffa come through the wormhole and down the ramp.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Greetings.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>ISHTA: Yesterday, we were to meet one of our contacts. A High Priestess stationed within Moloc's temple. She failed to appear at the allotted time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>TEAL'C: You must evacuate immediately.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>ISHTA: I agree. But we know not of another unihabited planet like Haktyl. Hiding a large group of female warriors and children within a populated planet in Moloc's domain is difficult and dangerous.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Well, I'm sure we could help you folks out. Carter?</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>CARTER: Uh, no problem. We have a number of possible worlds on record, but they should be explored more thoroughly before you take up permanent residence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>ISHTA: If Moloc is aware of our location, every moment my people remain on Haktyl puts them at greater risk.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>KAR'YN: (annoyed) Stop it. You're embarrassing me. I'm not an object to be worshipped.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>RYA'C: (moving past the awkward moment) Thank you for agreeing to host our union ceremony. It will be an honor to be betrothed among friends.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>DANIEL: (surprised) Oh, you're going to have the wedding here?</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>KAR'YN: Of course. Ishta said it may take some time to find a suitable planet for our new home. We are to be married in three days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel and Carter give big fake smiles to hide their horror. Daniel puts his hand on Carter's far shoulder, and she puts her hand over his.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>KAR'YN: There is much to do. Rya'c?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They leave. Carter taps her finger against Daniel's hand where it rests on her shoulder. They continue their fake smiles.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>O'NEILL: What?</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: I am to officiate at the Rite of Everlasting Union between Rya'c and Kar'yn. I have consulted with Ishta in the matter, and despite the evacuation of Haktyl, she wishes the wedding to proceed as planned, and as scheduled.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Meaning, here?</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: A more suitable world is not likely to be found in time. Delaying the ceremony would only grant another victory to Moloc's tyranny.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>O'NEILL: You know what it took to get approval for 'Tailgate Tuesdays,' huh?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--ISHTA'S QUARTERS</td></tr>
<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Ishta is in a VIP room decorated with candles, which she is arranging. Teal'c enters without knocking and closes the door.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>TEAL'C: You have been avoiding me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She stands but doesn't face him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>ISHTA: You have indicated I am not worthy of your presence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L110"><td><a href="#L110">110</a></td><td>TEAL'C: How so?</td></tr>

<tr id="L111"><td><a href="#L111">111</a></td><td>ISHTA: Your refusal to bless this union is an insult to Kar'yn and thus to me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>TEAL'C: That is not what I intended. Rya'c has pledged to help lead the Jaffa in the battle against the Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>ISHTA: As have I, and my people. A warrior is always stronger with another at his side. So you must believe Kar'yn to be an unworthy warrior. And I am at fault as her teacher.</td></tr>

<tr id="L114"><td><a href="#L114">114</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Ishta, this is not about you. Soon enough Rya'c will have to choose between his responsibility to his family and to that of his cause, just as I once did. I merely believe that he is young and has much time ahead, and need not undertake such a decision so soon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L115"><td><a href="#L115">115</a></td><td>ISHTA: In the same way Rya'c had no say in your decision, you have no say in his. None of us choose oppression at the hand of the Goa'uld, nor what must be done to free ourselves of it. But we must not sacrifice that which makes us Jaffa. I have organized both men and women to fight together, to rise up against Moloc. Maybe once we are free of his tyranny, you will see that we are worthy of your war.</td></tr>

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Overthrowing Moloc alone will ultimately prove nothing. Were he to fall, his worlds and armies will simply be usurped by another Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L117"><td><a href="#L117">117</a></td><td>ISHTA: (nearly shouting) I will not stand idly by and watch more of my sisters slain at the hand of Moloc, while you and the leaders of this so called Jaffa rebellion, you plot and you scheme and you ultimately do nothing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L118"><td><a href="#L118">118</a></td><td>TEAL'C: You have no wish to fight side by side--only to control and dominate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L119"><td><a href="#L119">119</a></td><td>ISHTA: As my sisters have been for generations.</td></tr>

<tr id="L120"><td><a href="#L120">120</a></td><td>TEAL'C: As you will continue to be because of your short-sightedness.</td></tr>

<tr id="L121"><td><a href="#L121">121</a></td><td>ISHTA: I will not rest until Moloc is dead!</td></tr>

<tr id="L122"><td><a href="#L122">122</a></td><td>TEAL'C: (very angry) I will not rest until all Goa'uld are dead.</td></tr>
