Teal'c grabs the gun and pushes the man back into the elevator, slamming him against the wall several times until he collapses. Teal'c takes the man's gun and drags the doctor inside.

He slams his captive forward, then throws him back into the wall. The man collapses. Teal'c turns and sees one of the aliens in it's natural form at the head of the hallway. He lunges at it with the zat out, but a security door slides down. Behind him, another door is sliding down, attempting to trap him. Just before the second door hits ground, a smoke bomb is tossed in. He watches the smoke rise, trying the doors to no avail. He succumbs to the gas and falls to the floor, unconscious.</td></tr>
