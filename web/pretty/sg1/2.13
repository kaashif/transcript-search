<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel, O'Neill and Carter are seated around the table. Teal'c, who is standing, opens a white case and hands one of several rocks from inside the case to Carter. She, seated next to O'Neill, holds the rock between them so they can both look at it. General Hammond is standing near the observation window, looking out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>O'NEILL: What is it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Trinium. Captain Conner and SG-11 discovered it on a routine exploratory mission on the planet PXY-887.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>CARTER: Yeah, I remember hearing about this. It's supposed to be 100 times lighter and stronger than steel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c has just squeezed and crushed one of the rocks with his hand.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>HAMMOND: That's a sample of raw Trinium, which is too brittle for manufacturing because of its impurities. We commissioned SG-11 to extract more Trinium samples from the planet. As of this morning, they are 48 hours overdue for the weekly check-in. It's time to find out why.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>DANIEL: Any indigenous people on the planet?</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Well, it is a big planet, sir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>HAMMOND: True enough...and Conner's people have only scouted within a few miles of the base camp, but they picked up no radio traffic, EM signatures, no sign of any indigenous life whatsoever.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: SG-1 join Hammond at the observation window and watch the wormhole activate. While they are watching, an arrow whizzes out of the wormhole, through the observation window glass and into O'Neill's right biceps. All fall to the floor when the impact occurs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Everyone all right?</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill is face down. He puts up his left arm to flag attention to himself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel is right there to help him sit up. O'Neill is in obvious pain and holding back. He looks down at his now blood-stained shirt and at the metallic arrow stuck in his arm.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel hands the front half of the arrow to Carter, who then hands it to O'Neill.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>CARTER: Our preliminary tests show it was made of pure forged Trinium. If there are Native Americans on this planet, they've come a long way, technologically, in the past few hundred years.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>DANIEL: And we just marched in and started mining.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: General Hammond walks in as O'Neill looks at the arrow and then Daniel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>HAMMOND: I've just talked to the Pentagon. While they're obviously concerned about finding SG-11, they also want to avoid further upsetting the indigenous people.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>CARTER: Meaning they don't want to risk losing the Trinium.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>HAMMOND: You're secondary objective is to negotiate a mining treat with these people. Obviously, we've started our relations on the wrong foot.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>O'NEILL: But that's so rare, sir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Captain, as you are taking over command of SG-1 on this mission, my superiors have ordered me to remind you to be diplomatic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>CARTER: Yes, sir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Just as I would be.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>CARTER: Thanks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She grins, then looks at General Hammond, gives a quick nod and leaves, closing the door behind her. O'Neill smiles.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--PLANET PXY-887--SG-11'S CAMP</td></tr>
<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: There is a black raven sitting on a rock in the middle of SG-11's camp. It caws several times and then takes off as Carter and Daniel approach the camp.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She and Daniel head into the tent. She sniffs, moves out of her ready position as she approaches a coffee pot. She picks up the pot and sniffs again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>CARTER: Ugh...coffee's boiled dry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel activates a computer screen that has gone to sleep.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>DANIEL: (reading the screen) "Currently extracting an average of 47 pounds of Trinium ore per day to increase our production four-fold as the engineers have requested..." It's a requisition request from Captain Conner. He just stops in mid-sentence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>CARTER: Looks like they all stopped what they were doing and just left.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c enters the tent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>TEAL'C: I found no sign of struggle at the blast site. However, a pair of footprints led me to two separate detonators. The first had been discharged. The second had not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>CARTER: So SG-11 was taken by surprise before the second charge went off.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>TEAL'C: That was my first conclusion, but there were no footprints leading away from the mine. It's as if they disappeared where they were standing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>DANIEL: Creepy...</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They hear a strange breathing sound. Teal'c exits the tent to investigate. We see a wolf on the hillside looking down on the tent as Teal'c emerges with his back to the wolf. The wolf leaves and Teal'c turns as he hears the wolf's departure. Carter and Daniel emerge from the tent as well.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>TEAL'C: (puts staff weapon to rest) I am certain I heard something.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>CARTER: Let's see if we can't find something more tangible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They are walking through the nearby woods. Carter has her weapon ready. Daniel is not far away. Suddenly, Teal'c calls from a rock above their heads.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Captain Carter!</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c points to a spot further ahead and to Carter's left. She comes around a tree to see a large totem pole. The top of the totem pole is a raven whose wings enclose many smiling faces. Below that is a wolf, below that is a raven eating a snake and below that several people in bondage. Daniel is standing looking at the pole as Carter approaches. Carter pulls out her knife and taps the handle against the silver parts of the pole. They are definitely metallic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>CARTER: Trinium...just like the arrow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c comes up the path behind them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>DANIEL: (pointing up) It's...uh...it's a clan crest...I believe, akin to the style of the central coast Salish Indians. It...it tells the story of the clans origin. This one tells of how they were brought here from a distant planet by evil rulers. Now, according to this figure... (points to Jaffa-like figure) ...uh, the evil rulers were probably Jaffa, taking them from Earth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>CARTER: So this was once a Goa'uld planet?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, according to the crest, the Goa'uld were destroyed by Xe-ls, who's protected them ever since.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>CARTER: Xe-ls?</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>DANIEL: He's the Salish's main spirit. On Earth he's a benevolent one, traditionally, and represented by this raven figure.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: There is a sound and Teal'c takes a ready position, aiming his staff weapon at the direction of the sound.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>CARTER: (raises her weapon as well) What?</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c moves forward slightly, but puts his weapon at rest again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He continues listening and looks as though he is following the sound around and behind him. Suddenly a wolf does cross the path behind him. Teal'c raises his weapon again, pointing at the wolf.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>TEAL'C: There!</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The wolf has now disappeared. Carter lowers her weapon and looks at Teal'c.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>TEAL'C: It was there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Suddenly, they hear the whiz of a dart.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>DANIEL: I heard that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>CARTER: Me too.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c is looking strangely toward his shoulder. A second whiz is heard.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>CARTER: Teal'c?</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Two darts have struck Teal'c in the back. He is beginning to collapse when Carter is hit with a dart. She falls near Teal'c. Daniel is hit and falls, too. Carter maintains consciousness long enough to see five Native American looking males approaching with bows.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Carter is lying on a bench in just her t-shirt, pants and boots, waking up. Teal'c comes from a bench off to her left. Daniel is just waking on a bench closer to the door. All are in just their t-shirts, pants and boots. Carter walks toward the door, which is open. As she nears the opening, a male stops her by standing in the doorway aiming his bow and arrow at her.</td></tr>
