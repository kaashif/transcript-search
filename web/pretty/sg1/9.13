TEASER

LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  HARRIMAN
     (into intercom) Unscheduled offworld activation.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Lam enter the control room and approach
     the window. They watch the wormhole activate with
     the iris closed. There is a bright flash of light
     barely visible behind the iris and an audible
     boom. Landry blinks in surprise.

  LANDRY
     What the hell was that?

  HARRIMAN
     (checking his monitors) I don't know, sir. Um,
     we're receiving SG-1's IDC.

  LANDRY
     They're back early. Open the iris.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens. SG-1, all in black BDU gear, walk
     confidently down the ramp. They pass the sentries
     standing at ease and move to their usual
     post-mission checks.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, still in their black BDU gear, sit around
     the briefing table. Landry finishes pouring some
     coffee into his mug and stands by his chair at the
     end of the table.

  LANDRY
     There was nothing on your end? Nothing out of the
     ordinary to account for what we heard?

  CARTER
     No, sir. It was perfectly routine. We just dialed
     the gate and stepped through.

  LANDRY
     The gate diagnostic showed no irregularities.
     Still, I'd like you to double check the data once
     we're done here.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  LANDRY
     Tell me about the planet.

  MITCHELL
     Well, we can confirm that the locals were visited
     by a Prior about two weeks ago. He performed the
     standard miracles, healed the sick, cured the
     blind, and passed out the usual literature.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell pushes a Book of Origin closer to
     Landry's seat.

  DANIEL
     The natives are easy pickings. They feel as though
     they were abandoned by their god, Amaterasu, and
     now--

  LANDRY
     (interrupting) Ba'al.

  DANIEL
     (surprised) Excuse me?

  LANDRY
     (sitting) You said, Amaterasu. According to the
     background file, P4R was once under Ba'al's
     control.

  ANNOTATION
     Puzzled, Daniel reaches for Landry's file folder.
     Landry pushes it towards him. Daniel reads the
     cover of the file.

  DANIEL
     P4R?...Sir...we went to PX7-455. I believe you
     have the wrong report.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel releases his hold on the folder. Landry
     looks skeptical. Mitchell reaches for the file
     curiously, and he and Carter look it over.

  DANIEL
     (continuing) Anyway, the Tok'ra have been
     monitoring the inroads that the Ori have been
     making in the region for quite some time.

  TEAL'C
     According to Selmak, they are taking advantage of
     the relationships between--

  LANDRY
     (interrupting) Did you just say Selmak?

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  LANDRY
     Teal'c, Selmak is dead.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 look startled and exchange glances.

  CARTER
     Uh, sir, Selmak and Jacob are very much alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons begin to blare.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Offworld activation.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The black BDU clad SG-1 and Landry clamber down
     the stairs and approach Harriman's station.

  LANDRY
     Chief?

  HARRIMAN
     It's SG-1's IDC, sir. This is when they were
     originally scheduled to come back.

  LANDRY
     (into microphone) Defense teams stand by.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The guards position themselves to alert status,
     pointing their weapons at the Stargate.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  LANDRY
     Open the iris.

  ANNOTATION
     The black BDU clad SG-1 team watches cautiously as
     the iris opens.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens. A green BDU clad SG-1 exits the
     wormhole and walks down the ramp. They pause
     half-way down as they notice the guards are
     pointing weapons on them. They look up and their
     expressions change to shock as they spot the black
     BDU clad SG-1 team standing in the control room
     with Landry and Harriman.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry looks back and forth at the two SG-1 teams
     as the black BDU team exchange shocked looks with
     each other and their green BDU clad counterparts.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 21, NEAR INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Landry waits outside the infirmary for Lam. Lam
     exits, and they begin to walk down the corridor.

  LAM
     Well, according to the tests I've run, they're
     both SG-1. Identical in every way.

  LANDRY
     How is that possible?

  LAM
     Well, we know Ba'al's able to produce adult clones
     of himself. Presumably, he could do the same with
     our people given samples of their DNA.

  LANDRY
     That doesn't explain how they knew SG-1's IDC. And
     if their intel was good enough to get their hands
     on something that sensitive, then how come they
     didn't know about Selmak?

  ANNOTATION
     Lam presses the button on the elevator.

  LAM
     Yeah, it's like they got the hard stuff right, and
     the easy stuff wrong.

  LANDRY
     Ba'al would've known better.

  LAM
     Mm-hmm. You know, the first team was making some
     pretty wild claims about people and past events.

  ANNOTATION
     The elevator door opens, and Lam and Landry enter.

  LANDRY
     And since the second team came back from the right
     planet at the scheduled time, it's safe to assume
     that they're the "real" SG-1.

  LAM
     (shrugging) Okay. Then who's the other team, and
     where'd they come from?

  LANDRY
     Exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     The two enter the elevator, and its doors shut.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The green BDU clad SG-1, now identified as the
     true SG-1 from this universe, brief Landry.

  MITCHELL
     We checked their story out. We went to PX7-445
     (sic), the planet they claim to have gated in
     from. The locals there swore they'd never laid
     eyes on us.

  LANDRY
     So, this other team is lying.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry sits.

  CARTER
     Not necessarily, sir. It's possible that they did
     gate in from PX7, just not the PX7 that we know.
     The multi-verse theory of quantum physics posits
     the existence of parallel universes, an infinite
     number of ever growing alternate realities that
     exist concurrently with our own. The theory holds
     that anything that can happen, will happen, if not
     in this reality, then in another.

  MITCHELL
     So you're saying that somewhere in an alternate
     universe, I got to second base with Amy
     Vandenberg.

  CARTER
     (annoyed) Theoretically, yes.

  MITCHELL
     (grinning) Boggles the mind, don't it?

  CARTER
     We're part of a meta-verse in which individual
     sub-universes are continually being generated. Our
     own experience with the quantum mirror proved as
     much. Realities can exist where we never defeated
     the Goa'uld, or the Stargate program went public.

  TEAL'C
     And Selmak is still alive.

  CARTER
     Exactly. (swallowing) Now, while it may feel
     immediate, the journey between gates is not
     instantaneous. It takes on average 0.3 seconds
     travel time. However, according to the gate
     diagnostics, the travel time for the other SG- 1
     team clocked in at 3.4 seconds, suggesting a
     significantly longer trip.

  DANIEL
     Okay, say for example we accept the possibility
     that this is an alternate SG-1 from a...parallel
     universe...how did they get here?

  ANNOTATION
     They all look expectantly at Carter.

  CARTER
     I got nothing...

  ANNOTATION
     Landry looks shocked.

  CARTER
     (raising her finger) ..yet.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING CELL

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Daniel sits alone at a table in a
     holding cell, his hands clasped in front of him. A
     miniature recorder is set up in the center of the
     table. The door buzzes open, and Mitchell enters,
     carrying a coffee mug.

  MITCHELL
     Sumatra Mandehling. One cream, two sugars.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell places the mug in front of Black BDU
     Daniel, who is watching Mitchell with a puzzled
     and wary expression on his face.

  MITCHELL
     Lucky guess. I usually have instant, myself. So,
     I'm guessing this almost feels like home, doesn't
     it?

  BLACK BDU DANIEL
     (dryly) Almost like home. But if it was home, I'd
     be sitting where you're sitting, and you'd be
     sitting here telling me: "I'd love to help you,
     but I have no idea what's going on."

  MITCHELL
     I'm thinking one of two possible scenarios. (A)
     Carter's right and you're from an alternate
     universe, in which case we'll do everything we can
     to get you back home. Or (B) you're not who you
     say you are. In which case, we need to find out
     what you're really after.

  BLACK BDU DANIEL
     Actually, there's a third scenario. (C) you're not
     who you say you are, and it's up to us to find out
     what you're after.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell studies Black BDU Daniel, then leans back
     in his chair and crosses his arms.


LOCATION--ANOTHER HOLDING CELL, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Landry speaks to Black BDU Mitchell in another
     identical cell, including the recorder on the
     table.

  LANDRY
     I understand your reluctance to trust us, but rest
     assured, we're just as eager to get to the bottom
     of this as you are.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     No offense, but I'm not entirely sold on the
     alternate world theory. There was nothing on our
     mission to PX7 that would even hint at it. No
     quantum mirror. No weird alien artifacts. It was a
     routine op. But, you're telling me that, somehow,
     the gate sent us through to a parallel universe,
     even though we know it's not supposed to work like
     that.

  LANDRY
     And yet, here you are.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     Assuming, of course, this is the SGC.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry looks puzzled.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     SG-1, six years ago. Wake up in what they think is
     the SGC, turns out, they're not really on Earth,
     and it's all part of an elaborate Goa'uld plot.
     The Pegasus Galaxy, last year. A team from the
     Atlantis base gates through to what they think is
     the SGC, turns out they're not really on Earth,
     it's another planet, and they're being manipulated
     by aliens.

  LANDRY
     Let me put your mind at ease. We are neither the
     Goa'uld, nor manipulative aliens.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     You'll forgive me, sir, if I don't take your word
     for it.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry blinks and is taken aback.


LOCATION--A THIRD HOLDING CELL, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Teal'c is debriefing Daniel in a cell
     identical to the other two rooms.

  BLACK BDU TEAL'C
     (with proud smile) We won our freedom in the
     Battle for Dakara. And on that day, not only did
     we defeat Ba'al and the Replicators, you ensured
     that Anubis would never again threaten this
     galaxy. And then all Jaffa were united under our
     new leader, Bra'tac.

  DANIEL
     Bra'tac? Really? Tha-that hasn't happened here
     yet.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel makes a note on his papers.

  BLACK BDU TEAL'C
     And with the new threat to this galaxy, I returned
     to SG-1.

  DANIEL
     Right, along with Col. Mitchell, myself, and
     eventually Col. Carter, who rejoined following
     her--

  BLACK BDU TEAL'C
     Following her honeymoon.

  DANIEL
     (stammering) What? No, I-I was going to say
     following her stint on Prometheus. Honeymoon?

  BLACK BDU TEAL'C
     Indeed.


LOCATION--A FOURTH HOLDING CELL, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Carter sits at the table with the
     recorder. At one side of the room, Carter picks up
     a glass of water, places it on the table in front
     of Black BDU Carter and sits next to her.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     We weren't able to stop the Ori from establishing
     the second beachhead. By the time we realized, it
     was too late, they'd already sent their ships
     through. If it happened in our reality...

  CARTER
     There's a good chance it could happen in ours as
     well.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     They destroyed Chulak, Dakara, most of the Jaffa
     strongholds. It's only a matter of time before
     they attack Earth. You have to find a way to get
     us back.

  CARTER
     I'm working on it. I've been going over the gate
     diagnostics.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     And?

  CARTER
     There was an unidentifiable energy spike just
     prior to your arrival. It's almost certainly
     related to the sound they heard, but I'm still
     analyzing the data.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     We were on PX7 for over twenty-four hours
     gathering intel. And yet, when your team went back
     to the planet, no one recognized you. Now, that
     suggests that our point of departure was
     definitely in our universe. So whatever
     happened...

  CARTER
     Had to have happened between the time you stepped
     through the gate on your end, and the time you
     stepped through the gate on this end.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     Except the gate system isn't designed to transport
     matter between universes.

  CARTER
     It isn't designed to take you back in time,
     either, but it has before. Did you notice any...

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Carter shakes her head negatively before
     Carter even finishes her thought.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     No unusual weather patterns or solar flare
     activity at the time.

  CARTER
     Then is it conceivable something else could've
     affected the wormhole?

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     What could possibly exert that kind of influence
     on a subspace matter stream?

  CARTER AND BLACK BDU CARTER
     A black hole.

  ANNOTATION
     Both Carters sigh.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and the green BDU clad SG-1 from this
     reality sit around the table, except for Carter.
     She stands by a projector screen which shows a
     computer graphic of PX7-455.

  CARTER
     As we discussed the situation, we realized we
     could pinpoint the source of the phenomenon to a
     precise window, specifically the interim journey
     between the two gates.

  MITCHELL
     Did she just say "we"?

  CARTER
     Pardon me?

  DANIEL
     She said "we". You said "we?"

  CARTER
     Ah, me and...myself, I suppose. The-the other
     Samantha Carter.

  MITCHELL
     Right. Finally some who could keep up with you,
     huh?

  CARTER
     (looking pleased) Yup. (turning serious, she
     clicks with a remote and Earth is displayed on the
     other side of the screen) Okay, this is PX7-455,
     their point of departure, and this is Earth, the
     point of arrival. The wormhole that brought them
     here crossed this section of space bisecting this
     singularity.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves the remote, creating a graphic
     showing a depiction of the wormhole between the
     two planets, a singularity between the two points.

  TEAL'C
     The black hole that was created when we destroyed
     the Ori beachhead.

  CARTER
     Exactly. Now, I'm theorizing that as they bisected
     the singularity, subspace was ruptured, creating a
     rift in the space-time continuum, that brought
     that SG-1 into this universe.

  ANNOTATION
     The computer graphic changes to show a three
     dimensional image of two parallel realities of
     PX7-455 and Earth. The wormhole stretches between
     the two realities at the point of the black hole,
     and a line indicates the travel path of the
     alternate SG-1 from their universe to this one.

  LANDRY
     But we've had teams gate in from locations on the
     other side in that black hole in our universe. Why
     weren't they affected?

  MITCHELL
     (raising hand) One more stupid question. (Landry
     turns to look at Mitchell) Oh, sir, yours was
     fine. Mine is stupid. Why didn't we end up on
     alternate PX7 when we gated through to check on
     Bizarro SG-1's story?

  CARTER
     I can't answer that. As far as I know, the
     deviation was one way and specific to that
     particular wormhole. However, just to be on the
     safe side, I would suggest that we reroute all
     gate travel around the singularity for the time
     being.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Unscheduled off-world activation.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The green BDU clad SG-1 and Landry clamber down
     the stairs and approach Harriman's station.

  LANDRY
     What do you have for me now, Walter?

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, it's SG-1's IDC...again. Do you want me to
     send confirmation?

  LANDRY
     If another team comes through, they'd just be
     stranded like the first one.

  HARRIMAN
     Receiving radio transmission.

  LANDRY
     Let's hear it.

  TIGER BLUE BDU MITCHELL
     (over radio in thick Southern accent) Stargate
     Command, this is Mitchell. What's the hold-up?
     We've got a situation here!

  ANNOTATION
     A lot of weapons' fire can be continuously heard
     over the radio link.

  CARTER
     Sir, if we don't open the iris...

  TIGER BLUE BDU MITCHELL
     (over radio, concerned) Stargate Command, do you
     read?

  LANDRY
     (into microphone) Defense teams.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The defense team aims their weapons.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  LANDRY
     Open the iris.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens. After a moment, another SG-1
     appears. They are dressed in tiger blue striped
     BDU uniforms and have a wilder appearance. Their
     weapons also appear slightly different. When they
     first come through the Stargate, they're still
     looking behind them, but as the wormhole
     disengages, they turn and spot the defense team at
     ready. They immediately aim their own weapons at
     the defense team.

  TIGER BLUE BDU MITCHELL
     (in heavy Southern accent) What the hell's going
     on?

  ANNOTATION
     Tiger Blue BDU Daniel spots Green BDU SG-1 with
     Landry and takes off his sunglasses in shock. Both
     he and Tiger Blue BDU Teal'c lower their weapons.
     Tiger Blue BDU Carter and Mitchell both crouch
     with their weapons at ready, but are similarly
     bewildered.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Carter walk down a corridor
     side-by-side. The rest of Green BDU SG-1 from this
     reality follows closely behind.

  LANDRY
     So much for this phenomenon being restricted to
     one wormhole.

  CARTER
     I may have underestimated its influence. It's
     possible the first spacial tear may have caused a
     ripple effect across several realities,
     transforming an area of their subspace into a kind
     of funnel that's redirecting their gate travel to
     this universe. Any wormhole passing close enough
     to the black hole is being drawn into the
     singularity and re-routed here.

  LANDRY
     So, you're telling me that we're the hub.

  CARTER
     The convergence point, yes, sir. It might account
     for why gate travel in this universe wasn't
     affected.

  LANDRY
     Might account? Col. Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     Sir.

  LANDRY
     Inform all offworld teams to proceed to the Alpha
     Site. Until further notice, gate travel to and
     from Stargate Command will be suspended
     indefinitely.

  MITCHELL
     What if there are more teams coming in hot, sir...

  LANDRY
     I'm willing to make the occasional exception, but
     I'm not about to turn this base into the Grand
     Central Station of the multi-verse. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 stops walking, and Landry continues on his
     way.


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Lee and Carter stand by a worktable and computer.

  LEE
     Why is it that every team that's come through the
     gate so far has been exclusively an alternate
     SG-1? I mean, how come no alternate SG-2s or
     SG-3s?

  CARTER
     Well, SG-1 is the front line team, the one most
     likely to get into trouble offworld. And, as a
     result, the team we'd be most likely to have to
     let through.

  LEE
     Right.

  CARTER
     So far, we've turned back over fifty teams, and
     not all of them have been SG-1. Here's the really
     interesting part. Each team from each reality has
     dialed in from a different point of origin. No
     repeats. All originating from a corridor of space
     starting from Earth and passing within a few
     degrees of the singularity.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter points to the monitor display. It shows
     several different points of origins, with lines
     that converge at the singularity and form one line
     directly to Earth.

  LEE
     What about that, uh, superfluous energy signature?
     Has that happened again?

  CARTER
     Nope. Not since the first alternate team dialed
     in.

  LEE
     Any idea what it was?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) I'm not sure. But it reminds me
     of the incident on...

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     K'tau.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee and Carter turn. Black BDU Carter stands in
     the doorway with an SF escort. She approaches the
     pair.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     In that case, we introduced an unstable superheavy
     element into their sun's nuclear reaction.

  CARTER
     When the wormhole that brought us there passed
     directly through it. But in this case, the
     wormhole is passing through a black hole.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     So who knows what the effect would be.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter notices Lee, who is nonplussed watching the
     two Carters talk to each other.

  CARTER
     I thought we could use the help.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee attempts to regain his composure, shrugging
     and chuckling nervously.

  LEE
     I suppose two heads are better than one.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Unscheduled offworld activation.

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons blare.

  CARTER
     Let's get to work.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Medical staff draw bloodwork from the Tiger Blue
     BDU SG-1. Tiger Blue BDU Carter looks at everyone
     warily. Finished with his blood test, Tiger Blue
     BDU Mitchell hops off his gurney and begins to
     pace the room with an impatient expression. Tiger
     Blue BDU Daniel and Tiger Blue BDU Teal'c sit on a
     gurney, back to the others, still getting blood
     drawn.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry watches the procedure. The Green BDU clad
     Daniel and Teal'c from this reality approach the
     infirmary door.

  DANIEL
     General?

  LANDRY
     Oh, I was just about to come find you.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks out of the infirmary with them.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 21

  ANNOTATION
     Landry, Daniel, and Teal'c walk along several
     corridors. They pass by a holding room that has
     its door open, but a guard posted outside. An SG-1
     dressed in green jungle fatigues waits in the
     room. They turn and look at Landry, Teal'c, and
     Daniel, overhearing what little of the
     conversation they can before the group moves out
     of range. Jungle BDU Mitchell looks back at his
     team with a somber expression.

  TEAL'C
     I have contacted Bra'tac on Dakara. He has
     dispatched a mother ship to the location provided
     us by the other Colonel Carter.

  DANIEL
     If the Ori attempt to establish a second beachhead
     there, the Jaffa should give us a heads-up.

  ANNOTATION
     An elevator door opens. Another SG-1 exits. For
     this one, the only recognizable figure is Col.
     Mitchell. He is dressed in a black t-shirt and
     green jungle fatigue pants. The other members of
     his team are young muscular men, all three of whom
     appear to be wearing the Atoneek armbands. Daniel
     does a double-take as they pass him in the hall.

  LANDRY
     Presuming of course, that events play out the same
     way in both universes.

  TEAL'C
     To this point, the particulars of the variant
     universes have remained remarkably similar.

  LANDRY
     That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Another
     SG-1 came through twenty minutes ago, which puts
     the count at twelve teams, not including
     yourselves.

  DANIEL
     (ironically) Well, at least we're in good company.

  LANDRY
     Well, this last team is a little different in
     terms of personnel.

  TEAL'C
     How so?

  LANDRY
     Well, there's someone I thought you might like to
     talk to.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry, Daniel and Teal'c pass an SF leading
     another alternate SG-1 team. These are the four
     familiar members, but they are all dressed in red
     hazmat suits, carrying their helmets. Daniel and
     Teal'c glance at the group. Hazmat Suit Mitchell
     turns around after Green BDU Daniel and Teal'c
     pass by with Landry. Hazmat Suit Mitchell smiles
     and drops his head before following the rest of
     his own team.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry opens the door to the room. Standing inside
     is Janet Fraiser, dressed in desert camouflage
     BDUs. Daniel and Teal'c are speechless.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Daniel? Teal'c? Where's General O'Neill?

  LANDRY
     I'm sure you all have a lot to catch up on.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry leaves. Desert BDU Fraiser's eyes widen at
     their lack of immediate response.

  DANIEL
     (stunned) Janet.

  TEAL'C
     (equally stunned) Dr. Fraiser.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     (nervous) What's going on here?

  DANIEL
     (struggling to regain his composure) Ah. Janet,
     this may look home to you, but it's not. This is
     not the Stargate Command you left; we're not the
     Daniel and Teal'c you know. You and your team
     gated to a-a parallel reality. This is an
     alternate SGC on an alternate Earth in an
     alternate universe.

  TEAL'C
     (solemnly) In our reality, Dr. Janet Fraiser died
     two years ago.

  ANNOTATION
     Desert BDU Fraiser stares at them in disbelief.


LOCATION--SGC SCIENCE LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Green BDU Carter of this reality and Lee stand by
     a monitor display. Lee points at the display,
     which depicts a similar image to what the pair
     were looking at earlier. Over Lee's shoulder, an
     alternate Carter wearing glasses eats blue Jell-o.

  LEE
     Sixteen different SG-1s, sixteen different points
     of origin, but only one point of convergence, this
     universe. Now, given the fact that previous trips
     through this black hole didn't produce a rupture
     in the subspace structure...

  ANNOTATION
     Behind Carter, Black BDU Carter pours coffee from
     a carafe.

  CARTER
     They may not have produced the rupture, but it is
     entirely possible that their repeated trips
     contributed to the deterioration of the space-time
     fabric that weakened, eventually ceded to the
     singularity, creating the bridge between the
     various realities.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Carter approaches Glasses Carter with
     some coffee. Glasses Carter accepts.

  LEE
     (nodding to Carter) And I'm thinking that the
     proximity of these realities in relation to each
     other may account for the absence of the, uh,
     entropic cascade failure. But, that still doesn't
     help us with the main problem. How do we reverse
     the process?

  CARTER
     I don't have the answer to that. Because if I did,
     we all wouldn't be here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gestures at the rest of the room. There are
     over a dozen Carters from alternate universes,
     wearing various military field uniforms, sitting
     and standing in small groups talking to each
     other. Black BDU Carter approaches Green BDU
     Carter with a mug and the carafe.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     Coffee?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) No, thank you.

  LEE
     You know, I can't help but think that this whole
     thing would be a lot easier if Hammond hadn't
     ordered us to destroy the quantum mirror. We-we
     could just use that to send all these teams back
     to their proper realities.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry approaches the doorway and stops. He scans
     the room trying to find the Carter of his reality.
     Neither Carter nor Lee are aware of his presence.

  CARTER
     How? I mean, there are a near infinite number of
     parallel universes. The chances of us finding the
     right home universe for even one of these teams is
     next to impossible.

  LANDRY
     Excuse me, Colonel Carter. (All the Carters look
     at Landry) My Colonel Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles, and Lee points to her as the Carter
     from this reality.

  CARTER
     Here, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry stands next to an alternate Carter wearing
     a black sleeveless t-shirt.

  LANDRY
     I've brought another volunteer who's offered to
     help.

  ANNOTATION
     A desert camouflage BDU clad Martouf approaches
     the doorway. He stares at the room full of Carters
     in surprise. Various Carters have a variety of
     reactions from impassive to amazed.

  CARTER
     (smiling and shocked) Martouf.

  ANNOTATION
     Desert BDU Martouf stops scanning the room, and
     his eyes alight on Green BDU Carter. He smiles.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     Hello, Samantha.

  ANNOTATION
     All of the Carters turn to their counterpart of
     this reality.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Desert BDU Fraiser sit in chairs at a
     table. A recorder is propped on the table. Daniel
     is sitting on the table while the three of them
     talk.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     I remember the mission to P3X. I was tending to a
     wounded airman. We came under fire. (gestures to
     Daniel) You were there. You-you helped me
     stabilize him and got us out of there.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is unable to look directly at Desert BDU
     Fraiser.

  DANIEL
     (in low voice) No, I didn't. You were hit by an
     errant staff blast and-and killed instantly.

  TEAL'C
     You were honored with a hero's funeral.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     (upset) Lucky me.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Daniel give her sympathetic looks.

  TEAL'C
     Hopefully you will be able to return to your world
     soon.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Hopefully?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, for the moment, it looks like your trip here
     was only one way.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     No. No. You have to find a way to get us back as
     soon as possible.

  DANIEL
     (nodding) Yeah, Sam and Dr. Lee are working on
     something.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     (insistent) No, you don't understand. We have been
     targeted by the Ori. Earth is being ravaged by a
     plague. Hundreds of thousands have been infected.
     If we don't find a cure, the entire planet will be
     wiped out.


LOCATION--SGC COMMISSARY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Desert BDU Martouf sit across from each
     other at a table, drinking coffee. Martouf's
     security escort stands nearby. Other personnel go
     about normal activities.

  CARTER
     (shifting uncomfortably) So...how are things...in
     your universe?

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     You mean, between us?

  CARTER
     (with an embarrassed smile) I'm a little curious.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     (smiling) Things developed, but with you being on
     the other side of the galaxy...well, long distance
     relationships can be difficult. I eventually
     joined the Stargate Program to be closer to you.
     We worked together, even lived together for quite
     some time. But in the end, things didn't work out.
     You're with someone else now.

  CARTER
     (curious) Who?

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     I think I have something.

  ANNOTATION
     Her security escort waits by Desert BDU Martouf's
     SF as Black BDU Carter opens a laptop computer and
     slides into the seat next to Carter.

  CARTER
     This is the post-mortem analysis of the P3W-451
     incident. (She turns to explain to Martouf) A
     planet whose orbit strayed too close to a black
     hole. One of our teams was attempting to gate back
     at the same time, and as a result, the SGC
     couldn't shut down the gate from this end. I don't
     see what this...

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     We were unable to sever the connection because
     Stargate Command was still connected to the
     singularity's gravitational field through the open
     Stargate.

  CARTER
     (puzzled) But we're not trying to--

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     In that case, we used a shaped charge to deliver
     an energy surge to the matter stream, forcing the
     matter stream to jump to a different gate, thereby
     severing the connection.

  CARTER
     That could explain the sound they heard, and the
     superfluous energy signature that accompanied the
     matter stream from the first wormhole. It was some
     sort of large--

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     (interrupting) Maybe a supernova or a gamma ray
     burst discharging at the exact millisecond that
     wormhole passed through that singularity. It's a
     one in a billion fluke that ruptured subspace and
     created the point of confluence that drew the
     affected realities into this one.

  CARTER
     Then to seal the bridge between the multi-verse,
     we have to target that point of confluence.
     Basically recreate the circumstances that caused
     the breach in the first place.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     But how is that possible? You-you said it
     yourself. It was a one in a billion freak
     incident.

  CARTER
     (reluctantly) Well, the odds would increase
     significantly if we took the wormhole out of the
     equation.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     (turning to Black BDU Carter) Then, what happens
     to us?

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     We'd be stranded here. (They all exchange somber
     looks. Black BDU Carter turns to her counterpart.)
     I considered not telling you about this.

  CARTER
     I understand why you hesitated, but you made the
     right decision. By sealing the rupture, we'll
     ensure that no other teams get stranded here.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     That's provided that this actually works. I mean,
     we still have one major obstacle to overcome. How
     do we deliver an explosive device into the
     singularity?

  CARTER
     We get help from a friend.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Asgard Kvasir sits at the briefing table. The
     Asgard time dilation device is on the table in
     front of him. Also there are the green BDU clad
     SG-1 of this reality and Landry.

  KVASIR
     Thor sends his apologies for not attending
     personally, but he and Heimdall are in a
     neighboring galaxy dealing with a most sensitive
     matter. In his stead, I have conveyed the time
     dilation device, as requested.

  LANDRY
     We appreciate your quick response, Kvasir.

  MITCHELL
     So, what do you think? Will this, uh, work?

  KVASIR
     I prefer not to prognosticate.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Mitchell exchange surprised looks.

  MITCHELL
     Well, don't prognosticate. Just tell us what your
     gut feeling is.

  KVASIR
     Speculating on the matter would serve no practical
     purpose.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter suppresses a smile.

  MITCHELL
     (muttering to Carter) Joseph and Mary. (to Kvasir)
     What are the odds?

  KVASIR
     Less than twelve percent, and that is provided you
     are able to enact the plan before the black hole's
     gravity decimates your ship.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 show concern at this news.

  MITCHELL
     (in a low voice) Damn, that's cold.

  LANDRY
     Col. Mitchell, Col. Carter, I'm giving you the
     green light. Shut this thing down.

  ANNOTATION
     The team begins to leave. As Mitchell and Carter
     stand, they are very close together. Carter is
     startled as Mitchell leans in conspiratorially.

  MITCHELL
     (sotto vocce) You know, I read all the mission
     reports on the Asgard. They're not what I
     expected.

  CARTER
     (also low) What were you expecting?

  MITCHELL
     (glancing at Kvasir) Well, pants for one.

  ANNOTATION
     Kvasir blinks at them.


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     An unprimed Mark IX Gatebuster weapon sits on the
     counter. The Asgard time dilation device is next
     to it. Kvasir and Carter study a laptop by the two
     devices.

  KVASIR
     The distance between the launch point and the
     target is crucial. And you must be precise in your
     calculations.

  CARTER
     I know.

  KVASIR
     The slightest oversight in either the timing of
     the explosion or the proximity of your ship to the
     singularity could result in a failed mission at
     best, certain death at worst.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter blinks several times and turns her neck as
     if to relieve stiff muscles.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry. I'm having a hard time concentrating.

  KVASIR
     (patronizingly) I understand. You are tired. Allow
     me to complete the calibration for you.

  CARTER
     (dryly) Knock yourself out.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gets up and moves away. She approaches
     Desert BDU Martouf, who is at another computer and
     is fighting tears. She touches his shoulder.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     (sighing) Time and again, we've managed to save
     Earth and its allies from the most dire threats...
     (turning to face her) ...situations in which we
     faced insurmountable odds, almost certain defeat,
     but we always managed to find a way to prevail in
     the end.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry. I wish there was a way I could send you
     home, or at the very least, delay the mission so--

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     You have no choice but to do what's best for your
     world.

  CARTER
     I assume yours is not the only SG team in your
     reality that's actively searching for a cure to
     the plague.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     No.

  CARTER
     And I have a feeling that your Samantha Carter is
     back home working on the problem.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     (smiling sadly) She stopped being "my Samantha" a
     long time ago.

  CARTER
     I've missed you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Desert BDU Martouf move closer to each
     other hesitantly. They almost kiss, then pull
     away, both looking down to see Kvasir standing
     between them, watching.

  KVASIR
     I have completed the calibrations.

  CARTER
     (weakly) Thank you, Kvasir.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Desert BDU Martouf both leave. Kvasir
     is left standing there, blinking.


LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Landry sits at his desk writing a report. Desert
     BDU Fraiser approaches the door to his office, her
     SF escort beside her.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     General, sorry to disturb you. I was wondering if
     I could have a word.

  LANDRY
     (standing) Of course, Doctor. Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     Her SF guard stays posted outside. Desert BDU
     Fraiser enters the office and sits in one of the
     chairs across from his desk. Landry also sits.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Thank you. Sir, I would like to make a request on
     behalf of all of the teams stranded in this
     reality. Please, postpone this mission until we
     can find a way to get home.

  LANDRY
     I can't do that. We need our teams out there
     gathering intel on the Ori threat instead of
     sitting on their hands here waiting for normal
     gate operations to resume. And that won't be
     possible until this problem is dealt with.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     While I can empathize, sir, believe me, I think
     you need to take a look at the bigger picture.
     This goes beyond this world, beyond this galaxy,
     this universe! Hundreds of billions of lives are
     at stake. Their survival could hinge on not just
     our return, but the return of every SG-1 stranded
     on this base. Sir, back in my universe, Earth is
     facing a global pandemic, one that your planet has
     already faced and beaten. You have the cure that
     could save my world. All I have to do is get it to
     them.

  LANDRY
     I can also empathize. But at the risk of sounding
     callous, my priorities are with this world.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     (struggling to control her anger) How can you
     prioritize the lives of one group over those of
     another? What makes my Earth any less important
     than your own?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry stands and Desert BDU Fraiser follows.

  LANDRY
     We have the top minds from eighteen different
     universes working on a way to get you home. Now,
     hopefully, they can come up with a solution before
     this mission is completed. But if they can't, then
     I'm sorry, Doctor.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     So if this plan goes FUBAR, we're the only ones to
     go down with the ship?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell raises his finger in a gesture of
     acknowledgment and nods.

  DANIEL
     (wryly) Well, there's plenty more where we came
     from, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel smiles at his joke. Black BDU Daniel blinks
     at him in surprise. Carter raises her eyebrows.

  KVASIR
     The perilous nature of this mission should not be
     taken lightly. There is a chance that the
     Prometheus may not survive this voyage. But
     courage and a steadfast resolve will prove the
     most valuable assets in this undertaking.

  ANNOTATION
     The two SG-1 teams stare at Kvasir in concern.

  GREEN BDU MITCHELL
     Of course, by the time he actually got around to
     drinking that orange juice, it had been sitting in
     the back of the fridge for what, a month?

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     Yeah-yeah-yeah. Oh, yeah. He was so damn thirsty,
     he knocked it right back. It was a second or two
     before he actually breathed in, at which point...

  GREEN BDU MITCHELL
     The spit take of all spit takes. There was orange
     juice on the table, the chairs...

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     (laughing) On Aunt Emma!

  GREEN BDU MITCHELL
     Aunt Emma! Oh!

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     Aw, big old Fat Emma, sitting across the table!

  GREEN BDU MITCHELL
     Little bits of bacon on her face. Orange juice
     dripping off her nose.

     The two Mitchells continue to laugh. Black BDU
     Carter approaches the pair, smiling weakly at
     their demeanors and overhearing the last part of
     the conversation.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     Reminiscing over old times?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, hell, yeah. I could talk to this guy all
     day.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     (dryly) No doubt.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     You finish your shift?

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     Yeah. I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     (standing) Speaking of which, I think it's past my
     bedtime.

  MITCHELL
     And you need your beauty sleep.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     (snorting) Well, look who's talking.

  ANNOTATION
     He claps Black BDU Carter on the back and both

     Mitchell. Black BDU Mitchell opens the case and
     pulls out three zats, handing one to each of his
     teammates and keeping one for himself. They exit
     the armory.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  CARTER
     I've got it. Relaying the information.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     Received. Engaging sublight engines. Proceeding to
     coordinates.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR, NEAR MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell jogs down a corridor. He skids to an
     abrupt stop as he sees Black BDU Mitchell just
     standing in the middle of the hallway, his hands
     behind his back.

  MITCHELL
     We've reached the target location.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     (stone faced) Yeah, I heard.

  MITCHELL
     (hesitantly) Yeah, I think they're just circling,
     looking for parking.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is obviously getting a strange vibe from
     his counterpart, because he starts looking wary
     himself. Black BDU Mitchell moves his arm out from
     behind his back and fires his zat at Mitchell.
     Already poised for action, Mitchell dodges the
     blast and heads down a side corridor. Black BDU
     Mitchell gives chase.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell runs through the corridor. Black BDU
     Teal'c is lying in wait in a side corridor, and
     stretches his arm straight out as Mitchell is
     about to pass. Mitchell's chest collides with
     Black BDU Teal'c's outstretched arm, his momentum
     causing him to somersault before landing on the
     floor, the breath knocked out of him. Black BDU
     Teal'c watches with an evil amusement as Mitchell
     struggles to get back on his feet. Mitchell is
     clearly groggy by the blow and the fall.

  MITCHELL
     (stumbling but moving to his feet) I should warn
     you, I've been practicing those Sodan moves.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell weaves and slides, trying to regain his
     equilibrium. He is unable to coordinate his
     movements and can barely keep his feet under him.

  MITCHELL
     You've been warned.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Teal'c grabs Mitchell by the scruff of
     his neck and slams him head first into a bulkhead.
     Black BDU Daniel and Black BDU Mitchell, zats in
     their hands, approach from the far end of the
     corridor.

  BLACK BDU DANIEL
     Wouldn't it have been easier just to zat him?

  BLACK BDU TEAL'C
     Easier, yes. But far less gratifying.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Teal'c grabs the stunned Mitchell by the
     collar and shoves him down the corridor. Black BDU
     Mitchell and Black BDU Daniel start to follow.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     (to Black BDU Daniel) Did he just insult me?


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     The green-clad SG-1 are startled when Green BDU
     Mitchell appears, holding his head in pain. Black
     BDU SG-1, minus their Carter who is already on the
     bridge, immediately follow, zats pointed at the
     Green BDU SG-1.

  DANIEL
     (raising his hands) What's going on?

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell shoves Green BDU Mitchell
     closer to his teammates.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     There's been a change in flight plans.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 appear shocked and concerned by their
     counterparts' betrayal. Carter glares at Black BDU
     Carter, who smirks at her.


LOCATION--SPACE NEAR WHAT USED TO BE KALLANA

  ANNOTATION
     The Prometheus moves away from the black hole and
     enters hyperspace.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIG

  ANNOTATION
     The door to a large brig cell opens. The green BDU
     clad SG-1 from this reality enter, looking
     resigned. Black BDU SG-1 stand outside the
     doorway, their zats still raised.

  MITCHELL
     You want to tell us what's going on?

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     We're making an unscheduled detour.

  DANIEL
     Yeah? Just how far out of our way is this little
     detour going to take us?

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     About three weeks.

  CARTER
     (mouth dropping in shock) You're planning on
     taking this ship to Atlantis. I mean, given the
     parallels between our two realities, I can't think
     of anywhere else we'd be going.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     As soon as we complete our mission, we'll drop you
     at the nearest habitable planet. Until then, have
     fun.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell locks them in with a satisfied
     smirk. SG-1 exchange frustrated looks.

  MITCHELL
     Three weeks. Well, that gives us time to think of
     something. Ideas, anyone?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell stands with legs apart and arms crossed.

  TEAL'C
     Given the unique circumstance we find ourselves
     in, it is possible to anticipate their actions and
     reactions. All we must do is think like them.

  DANIEL
     Well, shouldn't be that hard.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c glances at Daniel, then notices the camera
     above Daniel's head.

  CAMERA POINT-OF-VIEW


  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c reaches up towards the camera. The rest of
     SG-1 look at the camera in cautious curiosity.
     Teal'c's hand encompasses the camera. The picture
     becomes static and then shorts out.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Carter sits at the starboard controller
     station. Black BDU Mitchell is in the controller
     chair. Black BDU Teal'c enters the bridge.

  BLACK BDU TEAL'C
     The other Colonel Mitchell wishes to speak with
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell makes a face and does not
     respond.

  BLACK BDU CARTER
     Are you just going to ignore him for the next
     three weeks?

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell leans back in the captain's
     chair and sighs.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS MESS HALL

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell leans against a table and
     stares at the hyperspace activity outside the
     window. He looks troubled. Mitchell is shoved into
     the room by Black BDU Teal'c.

  MITCHELL
     You guys seem reasonable, and you haven't hurt
     us...much.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell gives a sidelong look at Black BDU
     Teal'c.

  MITCHELL
     You don't have beards, so you're not from the evil
     twin universe, right? Good. All right, so if I
     know me like I do, I'd have a pretty damn good
     reason to be doing what you guys are doing. Bottom
     line is, I'd understand better than anyone. So,
     level with me. What's going on?

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     Let me ask you something, how far would you go to
     save the lives of every man and woman on Earth?
     Don't bother. I already know the answer. And if
     you were in my situation, you'd be doing the exact
     same--

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell walks away from Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     What, going after the ZPM?

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell falters for a second before
     straightening his back and turning around.

  MITCHELL
     Come on. Why else would you go to Atlantis?

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     Our ZPM is depleted. We need yours to power the
     Ancient weapon in Antarctica.

  MITCHELL
     Oh right, screw our Earth to save your own.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     All that ZPM is doing right now is allowing
     one-way travel from the Pegasus Galaxy to Earth.
     The billions of the lives that we save is worth
     more the inconvenience of schlepping back and
     forth on the Daedalus.

  MITCHELL
     We need that ZPM to cloak Atlantis. If the Wraith
     come back and discover the city wasn't destroyed,
     they'll launch another attack. If Atlantis falls,
     this galaxy is the next target.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     If the Wraith return. If they attack. If the city
     is destroyed. The threat we face is more
     immediate.

  MITCHELL
     That still doesn't give you the right to do this.
     Well, say it works. Say that you can beam the ZPM
     off Atlantis. How do you plan to get it back to
     your own universe?

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell turns his back and moves away
     from his counterpart.

  MITCHELL
     (realizing) You have a way back. (more upset)
     You've planned this all along.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell gives a subtle signal to Black
     BDU Teal'c. Black BDU Teal'c moves towards
     Mitchell menacingly. Black BDU Mitchell turns
     around and watches impassively.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIG

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the green BDU clad SG-1 from this
     reality wait impatiently in the cell. The door to
     cell opens. Green BDU Mitchell is shoved into the
     cell by Black BDU Teal'c, who then locks them in.

  GREEN BDU MITCHELL
     Well, we were right. They're going after the ZPM.

  ANNOTATION
     Green BDU Carter moves to the wall and starts
     fooling with some wires behind a panel.

  GREEN BDU MITCHELL
     You sure you can open the door?

  GREEN BDU CARTER
     Hey, I helped build this thing. Opening the door
     is the easy part. It's taking the ship back
     that'll be tricky.

  ANNOTATION
     She connects some wires, and sparks fly.


LOCATION--DECK SIX CORRIDOR, PROMETHEUS

  ANNOTATION
     The brig door opens. Green BDU SG-1 leave their
     cell and look around the corridor. Teal'c starts
     to move in one direction.

  TEAL'C
     The armory is this way.

  CARTER
     No, Teal'c, go to the armory on the next level.
     It's less likely you'll be spotted. Daniel and I
     will head to the engine room and pull the control
     crystal. Once they come to investigate the
     problem, we'll get the drop on them there.

  TEAL'C
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     They part ways, the green BDU clad Carter and
     Daniel going one way, the green BDU clad Mitchell
     and Teal'c going another. Green BDU Mitchell and
     Teal'c enter an elevator, and the doors close.


LOCATION--DECK FIVE CORRIDOR, NEAR ARMORY, PROMETHEUS

  ANNOTATION
     Green BDU clad Mitchell and Teal'c exit the
     elevator and head towards the armory. Teal'c moves
     ahead to the door, reaching into the control box
     to override the lock.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c pauses as he hears footsteps behind him. He
     turns to find Black BDU Daniel and Black BDU
     Teal'c on either side of a relaxed Green BDU
     Mitchell, aiming their zats at Teal'c. Green BDU
     Mitchell is actually the alternate Mitchell of the
     Black BDU team.

  GREEN BDU/ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     Hey, you had to give it a shot. I know I would.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head at them and holds his arms
     away from his body in surrender.

  ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     So, now that we know how you get out, we'll just
     have to make sure it doesn't happen again.

  ANNOTATION
     Zat blasts sound from behind them and Black BDU
     Daniel and Black BDU Teal'c crumple to the floor,
     unconscious. Alternate Mitchell turns in shock to
     watch his teammates fall. He looks behind him to
     see the green BDU clad Carter and Daniel of this
     universe aiming zats at him. He turns back to
     Teal'c, who is starting to approach with the same
     smile that Black BDU Teal'c had just before he
     beat up the Mitchell of this universe.

  ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     (nervously, to Teal'c) No hitting.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c stops moving forward. Alternate Mitchell
     turns sideways and looks at Daniel and Carter.

  ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     So while we were up here...

  DANIEL
     We were down in the next level, breaking into the
     other armory.

  ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     How did you know I wasn't your Mitchell?

  CARTER
     Easy. If we were in your position, we would've
     done the same thing.

  ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     (scrunching his face in confusion) Now, let me get
     this straight. We figured that you guys would try
     to escape, and we set this trap for you. Not
     realizing that you'd figure out that we'd figure
     you out, and you set your own.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel exchange confused frowns. Teal'c
     ponders Mitchell's words.

  TEAL'C
     (after a pause) Indeed.

  CARTER
     Now, can you take us to our Col. Mitchell?


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIG

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, and Black BDU Teal'c, Black BDU
     Daniel, and Black BDU Carter enter, looking
     resigned. The black clad team is followed by their
     teammate Mitchell, who is stripped to his black
     t-shirt, boxer briefs, and boots. Green BDU Daniel
     from this reality pauses by the door.

  DANIEL
     Sam disabled the power relay running through these
     walls, so I...I wouldn't bother.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods and gives a satisfied smirk before
     moving away. This reality's Mitchell moves to the
     door, dressed identically to the alternate, but
     holding both the green and black BDUs in his arm.
     He has an annoyed look on his face as he slams the
     door shut on the alternate team.

  ANNOTATION
     Alternate Mitchell stands with legs apart and arms
     crossed.

  ALTERNATE MITCHELL
     Ideas, anyone?

  ANNOTATION
     His black BDU clad teammates avoid looking at him.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry clambers down the staircase and approaches
     Harriman's station.

  LANDRY
     Walter?

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, it's a subspace communication from the
     Prometheus.

  LANDRY
     Let's hear it.

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  CARTER
     (via radio) Sir, this is Colonel Carter.

  LANDRY
     Good to hear from you, Colonel. I take it the
     mission was a success.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  CARTER
     (into radio) No, sir. In fact, we're scrapping the
     mission and heading back home.

  LANDRY
     (via radio) Colonel?

  CARTER
     Sir, I think I've figured out a way to send these
     teams back to their proper realities.

  LANDRY
     (via radio) And how do we do that?

  CARTER
     (into radio) By doing exactly the same thing the
     first team did in order to get here.


LOCATION--LEVEL 28 CORRIDOR, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and this reality's Mitchell walk down a
     level 28 corridor. Green BDU Teal'c follows
     closely behind.

  LANDRY
     You're telling me they planned this from the
     get-go?

  MITCHELL
     Yes, sir. It accounts for the boom you heard and
     the extra energy signature the gate diagnostic
     picked up in the first matter stream. They opened
     the wormhole through the black hole and then
     blasted a bridge into this universe. (looking back
     at Teal'c) Isn't that how Carter described it? I
     don't know. I just remember, wormhole, black hole,
     blast.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Several workers and sentries are looking up in the
     area near the Stargate. Visible through the window
     to the control room, Carter sits a control
     station. To her right, Harriman sits in his usual
     station. Kvasir stands between them. Daniel stands
     behind Carter. Landry, Mitchell, and Teal'c join
     them.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is watching Siler in a cherry picker
     crane several feet off the floor working with a
     large round device suspended from above near the
     base of the ramp. The device points at an active
     outgoing wormhole.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  LANDRY
     Colonel Carter?

  CARTER
     Sir, we've established a wormhole to PX7-455. Now
     when Sgt. Siler is finished, we'll fire the
     directed energy weapon through the gate.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman studies Kvasir. Kvasir turns to look at
     Harriman, who nervously turns away.

  CARTER
     (continuing) If I'm right, it should reverse the
     space-time rupture effectively inverting the
     convergence effect. Each team gated in from a
     different point of origin. Once the convergence
     effect has been reversed,

  ANNOTATION
     As Carter speaks, Landry looks back at Daniel and
     Mitchell in confusion. Daniel shakes his head in
     warning and Mitchell shrugs. Carter continues,
     oblivious to their non-verbal exchange.

  CARTER
     (continuing) ...we'll dial those different points
     of origin and create wormholes that will follow
     the inter-universal pathways already created by
     their initial trips here--

  LANDRY
     I got it, I got it. They're going back.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter swallows and nods, looking chastised.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Siler lowers the cherry picker to the floor and
     nods up to Landry.

  SILER
     (calling to control room) Ready when you are, sir.

  LANDRY
     (via microphone) Clear the gate room.

  ANNOTATION
     The personnel in the gate room exit via the two
     doors.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  KVASIR
     I will need the weapon back once your work here is
     completed. It is, after all, only on loan to you,
     temporarily.

  CARTER
     (annoyed) I know. You'll get it back when we're
     done.

  LANDRY
     Lower the blast door.

  ANNOTATION
     The blast door lowers.

  LANDRY
     Fire the weapon.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The weapon powers up and fires, sending a large
     white energy wave through the active Stargate.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 monitors the progress on the control room
     monitors. Carter and Kvasir exchange looks.

  CARTER
     (watching the monitors) We have stable wormhole.
     3.4 seconds. It worked.

  LANDRY
     Open the blast doors. Bring them in.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The blast door rises, and the control room window
     is visible. The door opens to the room, and a full
     contingent of armed SFs start entering. Black BDU
     SG-1 stands just outside the door. After the first
     group of SFs enter, a resigned and frustrated
     Black BDU SG-1 follows, more armed guards
     following behind them. Black BDU SG-1 heads up the
     ramp to go through the wormhole.

  BLACK BDU MITCHELL
     (turning back and calling to the control room)
     Hey, Mitchell. When the time comes, cut the green
     one.

  ANNOTATION
     Black BDU Mitchell smiles to himself. He then
     walks the rest of the way up the ramp and enters
     the wormhole. Green BDU SG-1 all look at their
     Mitchell.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  MITCHELL
     What the hell does that mean?

  DANIEL
     I don't know...but I have a feeling that someday
     you're going to find out.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, Landry and Desert BDU Martouf stand at the
     base of the ramp. The Stargate is dialing an
     outgoing wormhole. Guards stand at their stations,
     but their pose is more relaxed then when Black BDU
     SG-1 was there. Carter and Desert BDU Martouf are
     talking to each other quietly, Carter smiling. The
     Gate Room door opens, and Desert BDU Fraiser,
     Desert BDU Mitchell, and Desert BDU Daniel enter.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Have all the other teams left, sir?

  LANDRY
     You're the last ones to go.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     It was nice working with you again, Sam. (Martouf
     kisses her on the cheek.) Your presence has been
     sorely missed on our team.

  CARTER
     (smiling) Just out of curiosity, where did I go?

  ANNOTATION
     Desert BDU Martouf looks away as if unsure how to
     respond. Desert BDU Fraiser exchanges a wry smile
     with Desert BDU Daniel before approaching Carter.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Maternity leave.

  ANNOTATION
     The two women smile at each other and share a
     deep, warm hug.

  LANDRY
     We have something for you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel holds a large yellow case and opens it,
     displaying the contents to the Desert BDU SG-1.

  LANDRY
     The cure to the Prior's plague.

  ANNOTATION
     Desert BDU Daniel and Desert BDU Mitchell exchange
     surprised glances. Desert BDU Fraiser also appears
     stunned, blinking and turning to her teammates.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Thank you, General.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel closes the case and nods to Desert BDU
     Mitchell, who takes the case. Daniel then wraps
     his arms around Desert BDU Fraiser in a tight,
     heartfelt embrace.

  DANIEL
     (softly) It's good to see you again.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     You too.

  ANNOTATION
     He releases her reluctantly, and they exchange
     soft smiles. Daniel moves away as Teal'c comes
     forward and also embraces her.

  TEAL'C
     (solemnly) May it not be the last time.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Desert BDU Fraiser exchange respectful
     nods.

  DESERT BDU FRAISER
     Well, we'd love to stay, but we have a planet to
     save.

  ANNOTATION
     Desert BDU Mitchell, Desert BDU Daniel, and Desert
     BDU Fraiser move up the ramp. Desert BDU Martouf
     pauses by Carter for a moment.

  CARTER
     (softly) Bye.

  DESERT BDU MARTOUF
     Bye.

  ANNOTATION
     Desert BDU Martouf heads up the ramp. SG-1 and
     Landry stand at the base of the ramp watching them
     depart.
