<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>CARTER: Not necessarily, sir. It's possible that they did gate in from PX7, just not the PX7 that we know. The multi-verse theory of quantum physics posits the existence of parallel universes, an infinite number of ever growing alternate realities that exist concurrently with our own. The theory holds that anything that can happen, will happen, if not in this reality, then in another.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>CARTER: We're part of a meta-verse in which individual sub-universes are continually being generated.

It takes on average 0.3 seconds travel time. However, according to the gate diagnostics, the travel time for the other SG- 1 team clocked in at 3.4 seconds, suggesting a significantly longer trip.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>BLACK BDU DANIEL: (dryly) Almost like home. But if it was home, I'd be sitting where you're sitting, and you'd be sitting here telling me: "I'd love to help you, but I have no idea what's going on."</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>MITCHELL: I'm thinking one of two possible scenarios. (A) Carter's right and you're from an alternate universe, in which case we'll do everything we can to get you back home. Or (B) you're not who you say you are. In which case, we need to find out what you're really after.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>BLACK BDU DANIEL: Actually, there's a third scenario. (C) you're not who you say you are, and it's up to us to find out what you're after.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>BLACK BDU MITCHELL: No offense, but I'm not entirely sold on the alternate world theory. There was nothing on our mission to PX7 that would even hint at it. No quantum mirror. No weird alien artifacts. It was a routine op. But, you're telling me that, somehow, the gate sent us through to a parallel universe, even though we know it's not supposed to work like that.</td></tr>

Wake up in what they think is the SGC, turns out, they're not really on Earth, and it's all part of an elaborate Goa'uld plot. The Pegasus Galaxy, last year. A team from the Atlantis base gates through to what they think is the SGC, turns out they're not really on Earth, it's another planet, and they're being manipulated by aliens.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>LANDRY: Let me put your mind at ease. We are neither the Goa'uld, nor manipulative aliens.</td></tr>
