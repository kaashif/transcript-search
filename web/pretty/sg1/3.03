<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>SIMMS: Since the reinception of this program, I have eagerly awaited every word of every mission report stemming from this base like a wide-eyed child waiting for his next bedtime story. Not actually being here, or seeing your faces, or this Stargate here behind me, it is sometimes easy to forget that it's all really happening. The President regrets not being able to be here, but I'm glad because it gives me the opportunity to congratulate you on your recent effort in defeating a formidable enemy and rescuing SG-1 captured in the line of duty. You risk your lives every day in a way more dangerous and fantastic than any of us could have ever dreamed. Understand that I represent every person of this great nation when I salute your ongoing heroic spirit. You should be proud.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>THOR: Her intentions are irrelevant. Earth has once again proven it can be a formidable threat to the Goa'uld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Oh, now we're a threat to them?</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>THOR: They have decided it is a concern to be dealt with. The System Lords are capable of launching an assault one hundred times more powerful than that which you previously withstood at the hands of Apophis.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Okay, that could be a problem.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>DANIEL: Plus I assume the Asgard would offer the Goa'uld something in return. I mean, that's generally the way negotiations work.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Well what if the summit fails?</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>O'NEILL: Thor said that was pretty much the only option he could offer. If it fails...total annihilation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>CARTER: The Tok'ra trust them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>THOR: It is customary for such negotiations to take place on the planet in question. Three representatives from the System Lords will arrive by Stargate. You must be prepared to speak on behalf of all the inhabitants of Earth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel is lecturing the people present on the three Goa'ulds they are expecting. An ancient Greek image of Cronus is highlighted on the projector screen.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>DANIEL: Cronus was among the earliest Greek gods, one of twelve Titans who eventually ascended to supreme domination. He was God of Fate and eventually became father to Zeus, Hera, Poseidon and Hades. Now this last relationship may indicate a connection to the Goa'uld Sokar.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Cronus is the most influential of the System Lords. It was he who originally banished Sokar. Cronus was also a mortal enemy of Apophis.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>DANIEL: Which may indicate why the System Lords didn't join in Apophis' attack on Earth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>TEAL'C: The System Lords reluctantly banded together to defend Goa'uld territory against outside threats such as the Asgard and the Reetou. However, they still battle amongst themselves for control of their individual domains.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>DANIEL: Also known as Yu the Great, he did not assume the role of a god per se, but may have been one of China's earliest Emperors. Legend says he possessed great mythic powers and sprang into the world from a dragon's body. Ancient scrolls say he founded the first recorded dynasty whose advances came about under harsh rule. However, it should be noted that Yu did account for a number of notable, positive influences.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>DANIEL: According to Thor's message, Yu is the most likely to favour this treaty as his interests no longer reside in this area of the galaxy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>HAMMOND: And the third Goa'uld, Doctor Jackson?</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>DANIEL: Another one we haven't met, but have a certain...familiarity with. For those in the room who don't know, Nirrti is the Goa'uld who wiped out all but one survivor of P8X 987, along with four members of the SGC, in an attempt to destroy Earth's Stargate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>CARTER: Cassandra's planet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>DANIEL: Little is known about Nirrti from Earth's perspective. In early Hindu reference she was a destructive goddess of darkness.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>HAMMOND: Okay, Doctor Jackson. Teal'c, you will assist Major Castleman with base security. According to Thor, Treaty Laws will not permit weapons of any kind in this facility during negotiations...</td></tr>

<tr id="L111"><td><a href="#L111">111</a></td><td>HAMMOND: We're largely trusting the Asgard based on your word, Colonel. This is their rule. As a result, the base is completely sealed off from the surface. The Secretary of Defense will be staying to represent the President. Storage Room 12A on level 17 will be converted to a meeting room for security reasons.
