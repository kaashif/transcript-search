<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Cut to an assorted spread of weaponry and supplies--those belonging to SG-1--laid out on a table. They've obviously been confiscated. A hand enters the frame to pick up one of the zatnicatels. The camera pans up to show us the owner of the hand, a young lieutenant, and the sergeant who struck O'Neill standing beside the table in a storage room. Next to the spread of weapons is a cardboard box containing the vests. The lieutenant studies the zatnicatel curiously.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The sergeant nods and exits. The lieutenant reaches into the box and pulls out Carter's vest, starting to go through it--and stops, noticing a yellow piece of paper sticking out of one of the pockets. Curious, he pulls out the paper and sets the vest aside, studying the note. The outside of the note is addressed simply to "George." The lieutenant unfolds the note all the way. Inside is the following message: HELP THEM. AUGUST 10TH 9:15 AM AUGUST 11TH 6:03 PM The lieutenant's eyes narrow as he reads the note, seeing something important in the cryptic message.</td></tr>

Carter and Teal'c are sitting at the table.</blockquote> CARTER I'm fairly certain that we've traveled back in time, roughly about thirty years. (as O'Neill looks up) For a second or two, I think we were in both time-frames simultaneously, which is why the Stargate seemed to be there one minute and was gone the next. O'NEILL Little bump in the calculations, Captain? CARTER I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what to say. O'NEILL Well, I'll tell you what. Get us back home and we'll say it never happened.
