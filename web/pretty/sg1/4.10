<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We see the camera pan across a barracks full of bunk beds. There are people everywhere getting up from their beds. All of the people are dirty and look as though they do manual labour. There are fires burning in barrels at the end of the beds.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Suddenly we see Teal'c sit up from a bed on the sounding of an alarm and join the other people walking away from the beds. The lights in the barracks turn on automatically. Teal'c has no shirt on and a thick bandage is covering his pouch.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--MAIN CHAMBER</td></tr>
<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We see the ceiling of the chamber. There are skylights there covered in snow. The camera pans down onto a line of people stood waiting to receive their breakfast. The whole area in dirty and seems to be industrial. We see a woman wearing somewhat smarter clothes than the workers walk out onto a walkway above the line of people. She is smiling.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>BRENNA: Colleagues!</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We then see a shot of Carter and O'Neill looking up at the woman. They are dressed in workers outfits and are both very dirty. The camera shows the line of people and we see that Daniel is also there with them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>BRENNA: Your attention please! I am pleased to report that thanks to your hard work, we now have enough reserve energy to heat the greenhouses for the next two months. Special merit to the workers of section twenty three!</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The workers all raise a hand and sheer. We see that O'Neill, Carter and Daniel all do this too. Teal'c however doesn't and looks around suspiciously.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>BRENNA: Let us use this not as an excuse to work less but as motivation top work harder. Our world may be covered in ice but one day we will reclaim our place on the surface!</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We see O'Neill and Daniel say these words as though programmed to do it. The woman leaves and the line proceeds to get their breakfast. Carter, O'Neill and Daniel are all next to each other in the line. We see Carter receive her breakfast from a woman. The woman spoons it into a bowl for her. She doesn't seem to like Carter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel grabs O'Neill's hand away from Kegan and O'Neill angrily grabs Daniel and throws him over his shoulder onto the floor. They proceed to fight each other until Teal'c runs over and grabs O'Neill off Daniel. He restrains a struggling O'Neill. Daniel stands up and stares at them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We see lots of machinery working in the area as the camera pans down to Daniel/Carlin and Kegan working at one of the machines. The machines seem to be in a bad state of repair and are sparking and smoking.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>KEGAN: Recovering from night sickness. It's a strange thing. There was this guy once a couple of years ago who tried to smash his way through one of those skylights.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>KEGAN: You would have known if he had. This place would have been buried under ice and snow and you would have frozen to death along with everyone else.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--ANOTHER MACHINE AREA</td></tr>
<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: We see O'Neill/Jonah hammering at a machine to fix it. He sees Teal'c approach and turns away to avoid him. But Teal'c doesn't seem to recognise him and walks straight past. O'Neill/Jonah seems confused by this. Suddenly there is a loud bang and we see a machine where Carter/Thera is working with others smoking and sparking. O'Neill/Jonah turns to see this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>CARTER/THERA: Actually I think there is! If we set up an automatic release valve on each of the stabilisers we could vent the excess pressure. I've done some calculations. If you want I could show you.</td></tr>
