Beneath The Surface
TEASER

LOCATION--BARRACKS

  ANNOTATION
     We see the camera pan across a barracks full of
     bunk beds. There are people everywhere getting up
     from their beds. All of the people are dirty and
     look as though they do manual labour. There are
     fires burning in barrels at the end of the beds.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly we see Teal'c sit up from a bed on the
     sounding of an alarm and join the other people
     walking away from the beds. The lights in the
     barracks turn on automatically. Teal'c has no
     shirt on and a thick bandage is covering his
     pouch.


LOCATION--MAIN CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     We see the ceiling of the chamber. There are
     skylights there covered in snow. The camera pans
     down onto a line of people stood waiting to
     receive their breakfast. The whole area in dirty
     and seems to be industrial. We see a woman wearing
     somewhat smarter clothes than the workers walk out
     onto a walkway above the line of people. She is
     smiling.

  BRENNA
     Colleagues!

  ANNOTATION
     We then see a shot of Carter and O'Neill looking
     up at the woman. They are dressed in workers
     outfits and are both very dirty. The camera shows
     the line of people and we see that Daniel is also
     there with them.

  BRENNA
     Your attention please! I am pleased to report that
     thanks to your hard work, we now have enough
     reserve energy to heat the greenhouses for the
     next two months. Special merit to the workers of
     section twenty three!

  ANNOTATION
     The workers all raise a hand and sheer. We see
     that O'Neill, Carter and Daniel all do this too.
     Teal'c however doesn't and looks around
     suspiciously.

  BRENNA
     Let us use this not as an excuse to work less but
     as motivation top work harder. Our world may be
     covered in ice but one day we will reclaim our
     place on the surface!

  ALL WORKERS
     It is my honour to serve.

  ANNOTATION
     We see O'Neill and Daniel say these words as
     though programmed to do it. The woman leaves and
     the line proceeds to get their breakfast. Carter,
     O'Neill and Daniel are all next to each other in
     the line. We see Carter receive her breakfast from
     a woman. The woman spoons it into a bowl for her.
     She doesn't seem to like Carter.

  CARTER/THERA
     Kegan, how about some bread?

  KEGAN
     (sarcastically) Sorry, just gave out the last
     piece.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     Oh here we go, every time!

  CARTER/THERA
     (annoyed) What is your problem?

  KEGAN
     I don't have a problem!

  CARTER/THERA
     And we don't have any bread!

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     Is there a problem here.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     (nastily) Stay out of this.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     Jonah, there are other people waiting!

  ANNOTATION
     We see O'Neill grab Kegan's arm angrily.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     Give here the damn bread!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel grabs O'Neill's hand away from Kegan and
     O'Neill angrily grabs Daniel and throws him over
     his shoulder onto the floor. They proceed to fight
     each other until Teal'c runs over and grabs
     O'Neill off Daniel. He restrains a struggling
     O'Neill. Daniel stands up and stares at them.

  TEAL'C
     This is not right! The two of you are friends
     O'Neill!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is still struggling to get out of Tealc's
     grip.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     Stay out of it!

  TEAL'C
     We are part of something called SG-1. I am Teal'c.
     Do you not remember?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel look puzzled at Teal'c.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     (angrily) Somebody get this guy off me!

  ANNOTATION
     Three workers run up and grab hold of Teal'c. They
     restrain him from O'Neill who backs away from him
     and bumps into an angry Daniel. Brenna approaches
     Teal'c.

  BRENNA
     Get him upstairs!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is dragged away from the chamber.

  TEAL'C
     You must remember! We must escape!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Carter and O'Neill watch as Teal'c is
     dragged away. O'Neill turns to face Brenna.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     Brenna, it is my honour to serve. I don't know
     that man.

  BRENNA
     I know Jonah don't worry. He's night sick.

  ANNOTATION
     Brenna looks at Kegan.

  BRENNA
     Give Thera her bread.

  ANNOTATION
     Kegan gets a new tray of bread and shoves it onto
     the serving table in front of Carter.

  BRENNA
     Get back to work.

LOCATION--UNDERGROUND PUMP AREA

  ANNOTATION
     We see lots of machinery working in the area as
     the camera pans down to Daniel/Carlin and Kegan
     working at one of the machines. The machines seem
     to be in a bad state of repair and are sparking
     and smoking.

  KEGAN
     These pumps regulate the overflow. Sometimes they
     get clogged and you have to...

  ANNOTATION
     She notices that Daniel/Carlin is not listening to
     her

  KEGAN
     Carlin!

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     Where's he been for five days?

  ANNOTATION
     He indicates to Teal'c who we se stepping through
     a door into the machinery area.

  KEGAN
     Recovering from night sickness. It's a strange
     thing. There was this guy once a couple of years
     ago who tried to smash his way through one of
     those skylights.

  ANNOTATION
     She points at one of the skylights.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     Did he do it?

  KEGAN
     You would have known if he had. This place would
     have been buried under ice and snow and you would
     have frozen to death along with everyone else.


LOCATION--ANOTHER MACHINE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     We see O'Neill/Jonah hammering at a machine to fix
     it. He sees Teal'c approach and turns away to
     avoid him. But Teal'c doesn't seem to recognise
     him and walks straight past. O'Neill/Jonah seems
     confused by this. Suddenly there is a loud bang
     and we see a machine where Carter/Thera is working
     with others smoking and sparking. O'Neill/Jonah
     turns to see this.

  CARTER/THERA
     Cover those valves!

  ANNOTATION
     Brenna approaches Carter/Thera.

  BRENNA
     What happened?

  CARTER/THERA
     One of the stabilisers ruptured. They're so
     corroded they can't take the pressure.

  BRENNA
     There's not much we can do.

  CARTER/THERA
     Actually I think there is! If we set up an
     automatic release valve on each of the stabilisers
     we could vent the excess pressure. I've done some
     calculations. If you want I could show you.

  BRENNA
     You can come by my office later.

  ANNOTATION
     Brenna leaves and Carter/Thera smiles at
     O'Neill/Jonah. They go back to work.


LOCATION--MACHINE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     We see Carter/Thera and O'Neill/Jonah. As Thera
     walks past Jonah he joins her and they walk along
     together.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     You all right?

  CARTER/THERA
     Fine.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     That explosion.

  CARTER/THERA
     (shaking her head) Oh no, no...I'm fine really.
     O'Neill/JONAH Good.

  CARTER/THERA
     Brenna wants to see me. She wants to hear my ideas
     for running the plant.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     You know you could take a few minutes off.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter/Thera laughs.

  CARTER/THERA
     Oh please! You work just as hard as I do.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     That's different, it's called stamina.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter/Thera smiles and laughs again.

  CARTER/THERA
     Have a good shift.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks off to Brenna's office.

  O'NEILL/JONAH
     Bye.


LOCATION--CHAMBER BELOW BRENNA'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     We see Kegan looking up as Carter/Thera goes into
     Brenna's office. Kegan looks at Daniel/Carlin.

  KEGAN
     There she goes! Why does Brenna listen to her?

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     (distractedly) I don't know, she seems pretty
     smart.

  KEGAN
     She thinks she's better than the rest of us!

  ANNOTATION
     Kegan looks over at O'Neill/Jonah who is working
     on some machine.

  KEGAN
     They both do.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     Teal'c said we were friends.

  KEGAN
     His name's not Teal'c it's TOR. Night sickness.

  ANNOTATION
     She and Daniel/Carlin exchange looks and then get
     on with their work.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     We see the Stargate activate. The klaxons are
     going off. Inside the control room Sergeant Davis
     is at the control console. Hammond is standing in
     the background talking to a technician.

  DAVIS
     Sir we're ready for the video link with P3R-118.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks over to the console.

  HAMMOND
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond stares at a computer screen and we see a
     shot of a man appear. He turns to look at Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     Administrator Calder.

  CALDER
     General Hammond I'm sorry to have to tell you this
     but our search has turned up nothing. Given the
     hostile conditions outside of the dome I don't see
     how SG-1 could have survived this long.

  HAMMOND
     With all due respect administrator I'm not ready
     to give up on my people just yet. We have
     specialised equipment and teams specially trained
     for this type of operation.

  CALDER
     When Major Carter first expressed an interest in
     exploring the glacier I tried to explain the
     danger but Colonel O'Neill was quite overly
     confident thinking they could handle the
     conditions.

  HAMMOND
     I appreciate your concern. But I assure you I'll
     take full responsibility.

  CALDER
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns away and the transmission ends as the
     gate deactivates.


LOCATION--CALDER'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     We see Calder walk to the window in his luxury
     office. A servant enters.

  CALDER
     Tell Brenna I want to see her tomorrow. I'd like
     to know how our new workers are doing.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     We see Daniel walking down the ramp from an active
     gate. The room is dark except for the light of the
     gate. Daniel is dressed in his work clothes from
     the underground plant. He turns around to look at
     the gate as O'Neill, also in work clothes walks
     past him to the gate. O'Neill turns and talks to
     Daniel but his voice is strange and muffled.

  O'NEILL
     Go ahead!

  DANIEL
     Go where?

  O'NEILL
     The other side.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly Kegan appears next to Daniel. He turns
     round to her surprised.

  KEGAN
     Carlin! Don't listen to him!

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly Daniel wakes up and sits up from his bed
     in the barracks. It has been a dream and he lies
     back down confused.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The gate is active and we see Hammond and Sergeant
     Davis at the main console. There are technicians
     in the background. Davis turns and nods at
     Hammond. Hammond looks at the screen again and
     talks to Major Griff who is on P3R-118. They are
     in a blizzard searching for SG-1.

  HAMMOND
     Major, what's your status?

  ANNOTATION
     The link to Griff is bad and he is very faint on
     the viewer.

  GRIFF
     (shouting) We've lost the UAV and we're getting
     back now. But I have to tell you sir, it doesn't
     look good. This place is pretty nasty.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks concerned.


LOCATION--UNDERGROUND WORKS

  ANNOTATION
     We see Teal'c/Tor shovelling some ore. As he is
     doing this Daniel/Carlin approaches and looks at
     the bandage around Teal'c/Tor's middle.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     What happened?

  TEAL'C/TOR
     I was injured.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     When?

  TEAL'C/TOR
     Why are you speaking to me?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel/Carlin walks closer to Teal'c/Tor.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     I just thought that err...since apparently we're
     friends from way back. I just thought that...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel indicates Teal'c's golden tattoo on his
     head.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     ...what is that thing on your forehead?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c/Tor doesn't stop working.

  TEAL'C/TOR
     A birthmark.

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     A birthmark, you'd think I'd remember something
     like that.

  TEAL'C/TOR
     I don't know you!

  DANIEL/CARLIN
     You said you did! Last week during morning line
     up.
