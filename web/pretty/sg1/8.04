LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill exits an elevator. Sergeant Harriman
     greets him with a mug of coffee, which O'Neill
     takes.

  HARRIMAN
     Morning, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Walter.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin walking.

  HARRIMAN
     At 0730 this morning, SG-8 made scheduled contact
     from P6J-908. They requested permission to bring
     an alien life form back to base for further study.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sniffs the contents of the mug but stops
     and turns to Harriman in alarm.

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, it's just a plant!

  ANNOTATION
     They start walking again.

  HARRIMAN
     Your 0830 debriefing is SG-2, regarding their
     recent mission to P8F-809. Folder's on your desk,
     along with the personnel files you have yet to
     review.

  O'NEILL
     How many do I have left?

  HARRIMAN
     All of them.

  O'NEILL
     Right.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Three men are standing at the conference table,
     two in USAF clothing.

  HARRIMAN
     Colonel Rudnell has asked me to show you some
     bunting samples, and uh...Captain Corrigan is
     still waiting approval on the buffet menu.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Harriman enter the briefing room via
     the stairs.

  O'NEILL
     Bunting.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman shrugs.

  O'NEILL
     John!

  ANNOTATION
     The men at the table turn to face O'Neill.

  JOHN
     General.

  O'NEILL
     You are aware of the fact that this is the most
     secure military facility on the face of the
     planet.

  JOHN
     Well, actually, sir, there are still a number of
     issues to be resolved.

  HARRIMAN
     (quietly, to O'Neill) Ten Hundred hours, sir.

  O'NEILL
     (to Harriman) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks towards his office.


LOCATION--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill enters, he sees a man sitting in front
     of his desk. O'Neill stops in the doorway as the
     man rises. O'Neill turns towards the briefing
     room.

  O'NEILL
     Walter?

  HARRIMAN
     Sorry, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman appears in the doorway.

  HARRIMAN
     General O'Neill. Mark Gilmor. He's your new
     administrative aide.

  GILMOR
     General.

  O'NEILL
     (to Harriman) Did I order one of these?

  HARRIMAN
     No, sir

  O'NEILL
     (to Harriman) Do I really need...?

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  O'NEILL
     (to Gilmor) Civilian?

  GILMOR
     I've been an analyst at the CIA for the last eight
     years. Mostly background checks, but I did have
     top level clearance.

  HARRIMAN
     He was assigned by General Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     Ah! Well, in that case, welcome aboard.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks to Gilmor and they shake hands.

  O'NEILL
     How about if I give you a tour around?

  GILMOR
     Ah! Had one, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Dang!

  GILMOR
     Very exciting to finally see it all in action.

  O'NEILL
     Hmmm.

  HARRIMAN
     General, your 0830.

  O'NEILL
     Yes. (to Gilmor) You're here to assist me right?
     How about if you dive into those...

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, sir, sir. You really need to read the file
     yourself. (quietly, as O'Neill turns to him) Yeah,
     yeah.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you, Walter. Does Mister Gilmor have...?

  HARRIMAN
     (to Gilmor) Follow me.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman leads Gilmor out of the office.


LOCATION--OUTSIDE GILMOR'S OFFICE

  GILMOR
     Well, he's not like other generals.

  HARRIMAN
     Actually, he's not like other people.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor notices a large pile of paperwork on his
     desk.

  GILMOR
     I take it I've got some catching up to do.

  HARRIMAN
     Yeah, and those are just the files pertinent to
     today's agenda, so...

  GILMOR
     I'd better get started.


LOCATION--SGC GILMOR'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor enters the office as Harriman stands in the
     doorway.

  HARRIMAN
     I can't tell you how happy we all are to have you
     here.

  GILMOR
     Thank you, Sergeant.

  HARRIMAN
     Really, really happy.

  GILMOR
     Thank you...Sergeant.

  ANNOTATION
     As Harriman leaves, Gilmor reaches for the phone
     to make a call.

  GILMOR
     (into phone) I'm in position. No, sir, he does not
     suspect a thing.


LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Harriman are standing in the office.

  O'NEILL
     Nothing in peridot?

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman is holding a large piece of bunting.

  HARRIMAN
     Well, traditionally, sir, this type of event calls
     for red, white and blue.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor knocks at the door.

  GILMOR
     Excuse me, sir. General Hammond is on the phone
     from the Pentagon and SG-1 is here for the 1300
     briefing.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill waves his hand at Gilmor, dismissing him.
     Gilmor leaves. O'Neill turns back to Harriman, who
     is still holding the bunting. Harriman shrugs at
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Walter, I just don't have the decorating gene.
     Would you mind?

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman leaves and O'Neill picks up the phone as
     he sits at the desk.

  O'NEILL
     (into phone) Sir! General, how are you? I know,
     sir, but every time I open my mouth to say George,
     General comes out.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks over at O'Neill who can be seen and
     barely heard on the phone. O'Neill raises a finger
     to Carter in acknowledgement. Teal'c is sitting at
     the table while Daniel, looking out of the large
     window, checks his watch. Gilmor is pacing behind
     Carter. O'Neill concludes his phone call and
     enters from his office.

  O'NEILL
     Okay.

  CARTER
     General.

  O'NEILL
     Colonel! You've all met?

  DANIEL
     Yes, actually, we know each other's life stories.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) That snippiness?

  DANIEL
     Is that a word?

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) What have you got?

  DANIEL
     A Gate address. For a planet formerly in Anubis'
     domain that apparently Ba'al hasn't discovered
     yet.

  CARTER
     We believe it may be home to an abandoned base.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c gets up from the chair, holding a device.

  O'NEILL
     And just chock full of abandoned weapons?

  DANIEL
     One can hope.

  TEAL'C
     This device was procured from Jaffa formerly loyal
     to Anubis. It should allow us access to the base.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c hands the device to O'Neill, who studies
     it.

  O'NEILL
     (to Gilmor) When's the next opening?

  GILMOR
     0800 tomorrow morning.

  CARTER
     Tomorrow?

  O'NEILL
     I got 14 teams out there.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry. Operations protocol?

  O'NEILL
     Is it?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hands the device back to Teal'c.

  CARTER
     Sir, the MALP showed no indication of any Goa'uld
     activity.

  O'NEILL
     I still want SG-3 to cover your flanks.

  CARTER
     It's just recon.

  O'NEILL
     All the more reason you can wait another day.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate alarms sound and the Gate activates.

  VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
     Incoming wormhole!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks over to Gilmor, eyebrow raised.

  GILMOR
     SG-5 and the representatives from Amora to discuss
     the pending trade agreement.

  O'NEILL
     (to SG-1) Oy! Love to stay and chat.

  DANIEL
     Jack, if those rebel Jaffa know about it, it's
     only a matter of time before Ba'al knows about it.

  O'NEILL
     One day, Daniel. One day.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Daniel, shakes her head and walks
     away as Daniel and Teal'c walk to the window
     overlooking the gateroom. They watch as the Gate
     opens and the two Amora delegates walk down the
     ramp, flanked by SG-5. They are met at the bottom
     of the ramp by Major Davis.

  DANIEL
     Here comes one negotiation I'm glad I'm not part
     of.


LOCATION--SGC. DR. LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is looking at a plant through a magnifying
     glass.

  O'NEILL
     It's a plant.

  LEE
     Exactly! 20 minutes ago it was a seed.

  GILMOR
     Excuse me, sir, if you don't mind my asking. Is it
     really wise to be bringing alien life forms
     through the 'Gate?

  O'NEILL
     It's a plant.

  LEE
     Yeah, and besides, offworld teams follow strict
     safety protocols in determining what to bring back
     to Earth. You know, if human kind is going to
     benefit from what we find out there, we have to be
     able to study it in controlled situations.

  O'NEILL
     It's a plant.

  LEE
     I know, I know, and I know our mandate is to seek
     out new weapons and technology to defend the
     planet from our enemies, but...wouldn't it be cool
     if we could exploit the wonders of the galaxy for
     other beneficial purposes, like curing disease,
     or, well, in this case...possibly...solving world
     hunger.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at his watch.

  O'NEILL
     Speaking of which.

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill leaves the room the phone rings. Lee
     answers it.

  LEE
     (into phone) Doctor Lee speaking.

  ANNOTATION
     He covers the receiver and shouts after O'Neill.

  LEE
     General? They want you in the briefing room.


LOCATION--SGC. CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c enter the lab. Carter is working
     at a laptop.

  DANIEL
     Hey! You...uh...want to get some lunch?

  CARTER
     No, I'm fine.

  DANIEL
     You just going to sit in here all day and uh...

  CARTER
     I'm not sulking.

  DANIEL
     Working, going to say working.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill merely believes that...

  CARTER
     Guys, I'm fine.

  DANIEL
     You know, you can hardly blame him for wanting to
     send backup. I'm sure it has nothing to do with
     you...

  CARTER
     I understand. He's just being cautious.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Daniel smile gently at Carter.

  CARTER
     Thanks, guys.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Daniel leave the lab.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Gilmor exit an elevator to be met by
     Major Davis.

  DAVIS
     General, if I might have a moment with you. We're
     completely stalled, the Amorans can't agree with
     each other, let alone us. They're like...bickering
     children.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe they need a time-out.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Gilmor walk down the corridor, leaving
     Davis looking after them.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The two delegates are standing in the room, face
     to face. A number of guards and other personnel
     are standing around them.

  AMORAN #1
     The plains of Goran are sacred ground!

  AMORAN #2
     To the plainsmen.

  AMORAN #1
     I am a plainsman.

  AMORAN #2
     I know.

  AMORAN #1
     I take offence at that!

  AMORAN #2
     Offence, now there's an idea.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Gilmor enter the room.

  O'NEILL
     Hi, folks.

  AMORAN #1
     General, I think it would be better...

  O'NEILL
     What do you say we take a little break. All this
     negotiating, it's just exhausting. And you've been
     at it a whole...hour, already. We've prepared
     special quarters for you. You can relax, get a
     massage, room service, whatever you need. Come on,
     I'll show you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures for the Amorans to follow him and
     leaves the room.


LOCATION--SGC VIP QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     An SF opens the door and O'Neill enters the room,
     followed by the Amoran delegates. A bowl of fruit
     is on a table, and O'Neill picks up an apple.

  O'NEILL
     Ha? Fellas. What do you think. All right, so it's
     not the Ritz but we do what we can around here.
     Knock twice when you're ready to talk like adults,
     all right?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks over to the door, ready to leave.

  AMORAN #1
     Whoa! Wait! General!

  AMORAN #2
     You don't expect us to share one room?

  O'NEILL
     Not...amicably, at first. But I have great hope
     for you boys.

  ANNOTATION
     As the two Amorans rush to the door, O'Neill slams
     it shut, and locks it. He waves the key at the
     small window in the door, where the two Amorans
     are standing.

  AMORAN #1
     You can't do this!

  AMORAN #2
     Open this door at once.

  O'NEILL
     (to guard) Nobody gets out.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill throws the keys to the guard.


LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters his office and sits behind the
     desk. He moves a pile of papers from the top of
     the laptop and opens it. He dictates the letter as
     he types.

  O'NEILL
     Dear General Hammond. Wish you were here, and that
     I was not.

  ANNOTATION
     The phone rings and O'Neill answers it.

  O'NEILL
     (into phone) O'Neill.

  FOUR DAYS TO ZERO HOUR



LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR'

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill exits the elevator to be met by Gilmor.
     O'Neill briefly turns away then starts walking
     down the corridor with Gilmor.

  GILMOR
     Good morning, sir. The delegates from Amora are
     furious. They're demanding they be released and
     say there's no chance that a trade agreement will
     ever happen between our governments now.

  O'NEILL
     Did they try the doughnuts? You made sure they
     were krispy kremes right?

  GILMOR
     Shall I release them and send them home, sir?

  O'NEILL
     Give them another day.

  GILMOR
     But, sir, I...

  O'NEILL
     No coffee?

  GILMOR
     I'm sorry, I can get some.

  O'NEILL
     What's next?

  GILMOR
     Well, Doctor Lee needs to see you right away
     concerning the plant from P6J-908. SG-1 and 3 are
     in the gateroom, preparing to embark, and it turns
     out that the red, white and blue bunting is
     unavailable.

  O'NEILL
     No bunting?

  GILMOR
     They can get some blue and white. And mix in some
     red.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts his hand on Gilmor's shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     It just won't be the same.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates as O'Neill and Gilmor enter
     the gateroom.

  CARTER
     Sir!

  O'NEILL
     Good morning, people.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks up to Daniel and Carter.

  O'NEILL
     Sure wish I was going with you. But I got a big
     day planned...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks away as O'Neill looks after him.

  O'NEILL
     ...tasting menu items for the buffet.

  CARTER
     Have fun, sir.

  O'NEILL
     You know I will. Watch your backs.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-3 walk up the ramp, followed by Carter. Teal'c
     walks up to O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Mind the curfew.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head and smiles slightly. O'Neill
     watches them leave, obviously not happy that he's
     not with them.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and SG-3 come through the Gate to a green
     forested area.

  CARTER
     SG-3, hold here.

  REYNOLDS
     Colonel?

  CARTER
     Colonel?

  REYNOLDS
     Bosco and Peterson can watch the Gate.

  CARTER
     We're fine, simple recon, we'll stay in radio
     contact.

  ANNOTATION
     Reynolds nods at her as SG-1 walk away.

  REYNOLDS
     Standard perimeter.


LOCATION--SGC. DR. LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Siler is hacking away at a plant which has
     completely overgrown the lab. Lee walks through a
     corridor of leaves towards O'Neill.

  LEE
     Well, the good news is it hasn't eaten anybody
     yet.

  O'NEILL
     Well, thank you, Seymour.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee laughs.

  LEE
     Obviously we underestimated its growth properties.
     It seems to respond really dramatically to any
     kind of visible light.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks around, then reaches back to switch
     off the lights.

  LEE
     Yeah, well, I thought of that. I just thought you
     might like to see it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill grimaces and turns away.

  LEE
     Don't worry, we'll get it under control. Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee looks up at the plant and laughs.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET WOOD AREA

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Daniel and Teal'c are reconnoitring the
     area. Teal'c stops and crouches. He is holding the
     access device.

  TEAL'C
     There are signs of recent Jaffa activity in the
     area.

  CARTER
     Try the wrist device again.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel walk over to Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     I have tried it several times.

  CARTER
     I'm getting some faint energy readings.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly the three are circled by transportation
     rings and disappear.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET GATE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     Reynolds checks his watch.

  REYNOLDS
     (into radio) SG-1 leader, this is SG-3 leader,
     come in.

  ANNOTATION
     There is no reply.

  REYNOLDS
     Peterson? You're with me. Bosco, if we don't make
     radio contact in ten minutes, dial Earth and
     report in.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly, an Alkesh appears low overhead.

  REYNOLDS
     Take cover!

  ANNOTATION
     SG-3 crouch down as the alkesh flies over them.

  REYNOLDS
     Son of a bitch!


LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting at his desk, doing paperwork.
     Gilmor knocks on the door.

  GILMOR
     Sir, Colonel Reynolds has dialled in from P2X-887.
     He's lost contact with SG-1.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Reynolds talks to O'Neill over the video link.

  REYNOLDS
     One Alkesh. It buzzed the Gate and flew off. No
     sign of the enemy since that, sir. I've been
     unable to make radio contact with SG-1 going on 19
     minutes. Requesting backup and permission to begin
     searching.

  O'NEILL
     (To Gilmor) SG-10 and 12. (to Reynolds) Back up on
     the way.

  REYNOLDS
     Thank you, sir.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Lee are walking through the corridors,
     which are covered in leaves and vines.

  LEE
     We have to close down the entire level, seal it
     off. Not only does it have amazing growth
     properties but it's proving extremely difficult to
     eradicate.

  ANNOTATION
     They come across Siler who is using a blow torch
     on the plant, with no success. Lee sneezes.

  LEE
     We think it's using the ventilation shafts to
     spread airborne spores.

  ANNOTATION
     The alarms sound.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM ENTRANCE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks towards the gateroom. He meets
     Reynolds exiting the gateroom.

  REYNOLDS
     We looked everywhere. No sign of them. I'm sorry,
     sir.

  O'NEILL
     You were there to watch their backs.

  REYNOLDS
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes his head, unhappy.

  REYNOLDS
     Colonel Carter insisted we secure the Gate.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gate alarms sound.

  VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
     Unauthorised incoming wormhole.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the gateroom and looks up to
     Sergeant Harriman in the control room.

  HARRIMAN
     No IDC yet, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram of Ba'al appears at the foot of the
     ramp. The guards raise their weapons.

  O'NEILL
     (to guards) Stand down, boys. (to Ba'al) And what
     do you want?

  BA'AL
     I have your friends.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures with his hands for Ba'al to
     continue.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  BA'AL
     I propose an exchange.

  O'NEILL
     For what?

  BA'AL
     Not what, whom.

  O'NEILL
     Whatever.

  BA'AL
     Camulus.

  O'NEILL
     Who?

  BA'AL
     I'll transmit the Gate address. You will send him
     to me, if you want to see your friends alive
     again.

  O'NEILL
     Let me think about it.

  BA'AL
     You have one day.

  O'NEILL
     Is that like...one Earth day? Or...

  ANNOTATION
     The hologram disappears.

  THREE DAYS TO ZERO HOUR



LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill exits the elevator to be met by Gilmor who
     hands him a small flask of coffee.

  GILMOR
     Nothing to report from the teams in the field. The
     rebel Jaffa...Tok'ra...

  ANNOTATION
     As they walk away from the elevator, O'Neill hands
     the flask to a passing Siler.

  GILMOR
     ...no one seems to have any intel on SG-1, and as
     ordered Camulus is being transferred here from the
     facility where he was being held. He should be
     here shortly.


LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is handed a report by Reynolds.

  REYNOLDS
     Even if we did comply and send Camulus to the
     address Ba'al transmitted we can't risk opening
     the iris here to let SG-1 through. This could all
     be a trick to get us to do just that.

  O'NEILL
     I know.

  REYNOLDS
     Any type of exchange would have to involve a
     Stargate on another planet. I made some
     suggestions.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor walks up to the open door of the office.

  REYNOLDS
     Are you really considering turning Camulus over to
     Ba'al?

  O'NEILL
     It's on the table.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor knocks on the door. O'Neill gestures for
     him to enter.

  GILMOR
     He's here.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor hands O'Neill another report.

  O'NEILL
     Colonel, have your team ready.

  REYNOLDS
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the office.

  GILMOR
     Isn't it already too late?

  REYNOLDS
     (quietly, with feeling) General O'Neill was once
     captured by Ba'al. He was tortured, killed, and
     brought back to life using a sarcophagus more
     times than you would care to imagine. SG-1 never
     gave up then, and General O'Neill won't now. There
     isn't a man or woman on this base that would.

  ANNOTATION
     Reynolds leaves the office.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING CELL

  ANNOTATION
     Camulus is sitting at a table in the cell. He is
     wearing a grey prison-type jump-suit. A couple of
     SFs are standing behind him. O'Neill enters.

  O'NEILL
     Ba'al has three of my people, and he's offered up
     an exchange.

  CAMULUS
     For me.

  O'NEILL
     Any idea why?

  CAMULUS
     There are many possible reasons.

  O'NEILL
     Pick one.

  ANNOTATION
     Camulus is silent.

  O'NEILL
     Nothing? You offered to help us if we granted you
     asylum.

  CAMULUS
     I did not expect to be treated like a prisoner.

  O'NEILL
     You're a Goa'uld.

  CAMULUS
     What are you going to do?

  O'NEILL
     Give me one good reason why I shouldn't turn you
     over.

  CAMULUS
     Ba'al cannot be trusted.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah?

  CAMULUS
     No matter what you do he will never return your
     friends to you.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     A hand-cuffed Camulus is escorted down a corridor
     by a couple of SFs with O'Neill following. Gilmor
     watches Camulus pass and joins O'Neill.

  GILMOR
     I thought you were just going to question him.

  O'NEILL
     He didn't have the right answers.

  GILMOR
     General, this goes against official policy
     regarding prisoner exchanges.

  O'NEILL
     He's not a prisoner. He requested asylum. I'm
     ungranting it.

  GILMOR
     You could be court-martialed.

  O'NEILL
     You know, if it gets my team back, I don't care.

  GILMOR
     But you know it won't. You're sacrificing him for
     nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns and walks into the gateroom.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Camulus and the SFs have paused inside the
     doorway. More SFs are in the room.

  O'NEILL
     Go, go, go.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor enters the control room. The Gate is
     activated. Gilmor and Sergeant Harriman watch as
     Camulus is held at the base of the ramp.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Camulus are at the base of the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Let's take a walk, you and me. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill takes Camulus' arm and leads him up the
     ramp. They stop just before the event horizon and
     turn to face each other.

  O'NEILL
     I've done everything I can. It's up to you. Last
     chance.

  CAMULUS
     In spite of what you think, I am not a coward.

  O'NEILL
     I think you are.

  ANNOTATION
     Camulus turns to face the event horizon. O'Neill
     rolls his eyes.

  O'NEILL
     Well, it was worth a try.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns Camulus away from the Stargate and
     leads him down the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Take him back to his cell.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor turns to Harriman, obviously puzzled.

  GILMOR
     It was a bluff?

  ANNOTATION
     In the gateroom, O'Neill, still on the ramp,
     raises his arms in a shrug.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill passes his card through the elevator
     access panel. As the elevator arrives, Gilmor
     walks up to him.

  GILMOR
     You could have told me, sir. How can I do my job
     if you don't trust me.

  O'NEILL
     Not my problem.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the elevator and presses a button.
     The doors start to close.

  GILMOR
     Wait, wait, wait. Camulus would like to talk to
     you.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING CELL

  ANNOTATION
     An SF opens the door to allow O'Neill to enter.

  CAMULUS
     (agitated) I cannot stay here. If Ba'al is truly
     so determined to have revenge he won't stop at
     this. It is not safe for you to harbour me
     anymore.

  O'NEILL
     So what?

  CAMULUS
     I am saying I am willing to leave.

  O'NEILL
     Out of the goodness of your heart?

  CAMULUS
     Of course not! When I asked for asylum I did not
     expect to rot in a cell for the rest of my life.

  O'NEILL
     Well, work with me, give me something! I'll see
     what I can do.

  CAMULUS
     I can tell you of a planet, where there is a
     device created by the Ancients.

  O'NEILL
     What's it do?

  CAMULUS
     I do not know. I never could discover its secrets.
     Perhaps you can.

  O'NEILL
     You think this is what Ba'al's really after?

  CAMULUS
     While I never disclosed its location, I once made
     the mistake of bragging that I'd found the device,
     at a meeting of the System Lords.

  O'NEILL
     Hard to believe, you bragging.


LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is once again dictating the letter to
     General Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     I knew it wasn't easy for you. But had I known
     what it was really like, I would have tried to be
     less of a pain in the ass. At least I would have
     tried harder.

  ANNOTATION
     The alarms sound.

  VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM

LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the control room and goes to
     Harriman who is at the monitor.

  O'NEILL
     Walter?

  HARRIMAN
     Receiving SG-3's IDC, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Open it.

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the Control Room as Harriman places
     his hand on the panel to activate the opening of
     the Stargate.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-3 come through the Gate and are met by O'Neill.

  REYNOLDS
     Just like you said, sir. Some sort of Ancient
     device the size of a large room.

  O'NEILL
     Any idea what it does?

  REYNOLDS
     I'll...leave that up to the tech guys. But I can
     tell you this. I know why I couldn't turn it on.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Reynolds opens a case containing a ZPM.

  REYNOLDS
     It wasn't plugged in.

  GILMOR
     What...what is it?

  O'NEILL
     It's a ZPM.

  GILMOR
     What is that? {Lee enters the room.]

  LEE
     A Zero Point Module. It's an Ancient power source
     that draws its energy from subspace.

  REYNOLDS
     It's the only thing powerful enough to activate
     the Ancient defence weapons SG-1 found down in
     Antarctica.

  ANNOTATION
     A beeping is heard in the room.

  REYNOLDS
     The one we have is pretty much dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee is studying the ZPM.

  LEE
     Well, this one sure isn't.

  GILMOR
     How good is it?

  LEE
     Well, I'm going to have to do some more detailed
     analysis, but these preliminary readings indicate
     at least fifty percent capacity.

  GILMOR
     Well, that's...that's good, isn't it.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shrugs, just as the lights go out. Green
     emergency lights go on.

  LEE
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee leaves the room.

  O'NEILL
     It's that damn plant.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman is sitting at a keyboard in the green-lit
     room. Suddenly, all monitors lose power and backup
     generators obviously do not kick-in. He makes a
     call on an internal phone.

  HARRIMAN
     (into phone) We've lost power to all control
     systems...Yes, sir!


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill exits an elevator into a plant-covered
     corridor.

  O'NEILL
     We paid the electric bill. I checked.

  LEE
     The plant is in the wall. It's interfering with
     power and communication lines.

  O'NEILL
     There's no light in the walls.

  LEE
     I know, but as long as any part of it is exposed
     to light then it seems like it can feed the
     unexposed areas. I'm recommending we keep the
     whole base on minimal emergency lighting. Just
     until we get the problem under control.

  O'NEILL
     How long?

  LEE
     Well, that's a little difficult to say, because
     first we have to figure out how to get the problem
     under control.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee sneezes.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the room and walks up to Harriman
     who is still at the keyboard. One of the monitors
     switches on.

  O'NEILL
     Where are we?

  HARRIMAN
     The dialling computer's offline.

  ANNOTATION
     Siler is under a desk, working on the system.

  SILER
     There must be a circuit board that got fried when
     we tried to restore power to the system.

  HARRIMAN
     Incoming wormholes will connect and we can still
     receive radio communication and IDCs, but...

  O'NEILL
     The iris?

  HARRIMAN
     Manual control.

  O'NEILL
     What about dialling the Gate? Manually?

  SILER
     Um, that's a problem. The inner ring seems to be
     locked in place. We tried disconnecting the
     control interface, but...

  HARRIMAN
     There was a 'gate diagnostic running when the
     power went down. It could be something to do with
     the commands being exchanged at the time.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill sighs.

  O'NEILL
     Bottom line.

  HARRIMAN
     We can't dial out.

  O'NEILL
     Okay.

  TWO DAYS TO ZERO HOUR



LOCATION--SGC SLEEPING QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor opens the door to private quarters. The
     corridor is still lit by the green emergency
     light. O'Neill is asleep on a bed. Gilmor walks up
     to him and pats him on the back. There is no
     response from O'Neill. Gilmor shakes him.

  O'NEILL
     What? Oh, God!

  GILMOR
     Sorry to wake you, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill rubs his eyes.

  O'NEILL
     It feels like it's been ten minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at his watch.

  GILMOR
     Yeah...uh...it has. There's an incoming wormhole.
     Ba'al wants to talk.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Gilmor enter the gateroom. The Ba'al
     holoimage is again at the base of the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Ba'al. Sorry to keep you waiting. Just taking a
     little nap.

  BA'AL
     The deadline has passed.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, look, we're having a little technical
     difficulty here.

  BA'AL
     Are your friends' lives meaningless to you?

  O'NEILL
     Hey! This is not a stall tactic. I would have
     called you sooner but we can't dial out at the
     moment.

  BA'AL
     Why not?

  O'NEILL
     Well, I'm not really sure. Here's some irony for
     you. Carter? Have this thing fixed like that!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill clicks his fingers. He then turns to the
     Control Room where Siler is standing at a monitor.

  O'NEILL
     No offence there, Siler.

  SILER
     (over intercom) Uh...none taken, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns back to Ba'al.

  O'NEILL
     So, why don't you just send her on through. Before
     you know it you'll have ole camelass back in your
     grubby little mitts.

  BA'AL
     You dare mock me.

  O'NEILL
     Ba'al, come on. You should know. Of course I dare
     mock you.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor is looking at O'Neill, very uncertain.

  BA'AL
     You have one more day.

  ANNOTATION
     The hologram disappears. O'Neill looks at his
     watch.

  GILMOR
     Is it really wise to provoke him?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns to Gilmor and stares at him for a
     short while.

  O'NEILL
     It's what I do.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Gilmor walk away.


LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Major Davis and Reynolds are sitting in front of
     O'Neill's desk.

  DAVIS
     Over two years ago, the Tok'ra provided us with
     the formula to the Goa'uld poison they developed.
     We've been modifying it. Manufacturing as much as
     we can use as a defensive option in the event of
     another attack on Earth. Area 51 is confirming
     that there is currently enough to negate a
     sizeable enemy force.

  REYNOLDS
     We think we can effectively neutralise and invade
     three Goa'uld occupied planets.

  DAVIS
     Now, the poison is non persistent so there would
     be a limited time before potential reinforcements
     become a factor.

  REYNOLDS
     And determining which of Ba'al's planets to target
     is still an educated guess.

  DAVIS
     We're still gathering intel on exactly where
     SG-1's being held.

  O'NEILL
     This poison. Does it kill Jaffa as well as
     Goa'uld?

  DAVIS
     That's right.

  O'NEILL
     How many casualties are we talking about?

  REYNOLDS
     Thousands. Tens of thousands.

  O'NEILL
     So, it's not really a rescue plan. It's a full
     scale attack.

  REYNOLDS
     That would most certainly provoke a reaction.
     Possibly another attack on Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes his head.

  DAVIS
     But, considering the fact that we now have a ZPM
     to power the Ancient defences I don't think...

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor knocks on the door.

  GILMOR
     Sorry to interrupt, sir, but Camulus is insisting
     that he speak with you again.


LOCATION--SGC HOLDING CELL

  CAMULUS
     (angrily) Did you not find something of value on
     the planet of which I spoke?

  O'NEILL
     Oh yeah, we did.

  CAMULUS
     Then why have you not released me? Or do you still
     believe you can trade me for your friends?


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

     Gilmor and Lee are walking along the plant-covered
     corridor. Lee is in full .

  LEE
     Gamma radiation seems to work. We're preparing a
     method of delivering a strong enough level to the
     entire base all at once. Now, non essential
     personnel are going to have to be evacuated.
     Everyone else is going to have to wear protective
     suits. You have to get General O'Neill to sign off
     on this right away.

  GILMOR
     You know, he hasn't slept in over two days.

  LEE
     Yeah, that's why I'm asking you to do it.

  GILMOR
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and John--the President's aide--are
     walking along the corridor. Both are in full
     biohazard gear.

  JOHN
     I'm cancelling the President's visit.

  O'NEILL
     Really? Why would you do that?

  JOHN
     I'm surprised you can joke at a time like this.

  O'NEILL
     That's pretty much all I can do at the moment.

  JOHN
     Your flagship team is in the hands of the enemy.
     You can't dial the Stargate. The base is overrun
     by an alien plant.

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel are hacking away at the plant.

  O'NEILL
     We did find a ZPM.

  JOHN
     True.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk up to an elevator and O'Neill passes his
     card through the access panel.

  O'NEILL
     Give it another day.

  JOHN
     You think you can get everything resolved by then?

  O'NEILL
     Wait a minute. I think there's a joke in there
     somewhere.

     O'Neill is once again dictating the letter to
     General Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     And so, I regretfully submit my resignation. And
     to be clear, the regret is not so much about the
     resigning part, but the fact that I was deluded
     enough to think I had possessed even one iota of
     the ability needed to fill your sizeable and shiny
     shoes.

  ANNOTATION
     The power comes back on. Gilmor knocks on the

  ANNOTATION
     The ZPM is standing on a desk, glowing brightly.

  LEE
     Basically, it shouldn't be glowing like this.

  O'NEILL
     Why is it?

  LEE
     Well, it's funny really.

  O'NEILL
     I like funny.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee is standing on one side of the desk, a pair of
     infra-red goggles on his forehead. O'Neill is on
     the other side of the desk with Gilmor standing
     behind him.

  LEE
     No, this isn't the good kind of funny. I think it
     was the gamma radiation we used to kill the plant
     that revealed this.

  O'NEILL
     Revealed what?

  LEE
     It illuminated a substance foreign to what we know
     to be the normal molecular make-up of a ZPM.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  LEE
     Well, we managed to scrape some microscopic
     fragments from the casing and run some tests and
     uh...You're going to want these.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands two pairs of goggles to O'Neill who
     passes one over to Gilmor. Lee puts his goggles on
     then asks a lab technician to leave. Lee closes
     the lenses down. He moves over to a bank of
     computers. A metal tray is sitting on a steel
     table.

  LEE
     This is what happens when you introduce a constant
     electric charge.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill closes the lenses down on his goggles. As
     Lee flicks a switch on the computer, the tray
     explodes. Lee and O'Neill raise the lenses on
     their goggles, while Gilmor takes his goggles off
     and looks in amazement at the tray.

  O'NEILL
     The ZPM is booby trapped?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee nods.

  LEE
     (shocked) We were going to send it to Antarctica.
     Can you imagine if someone had taken it and
     plugged it into the chair in the Ancient Outpost?
     I can't even imagine the magnitude of the
     explosion. A charged ZPM detonating that? I don't
     know, I mean, it could have destroyed the whole
     planet.

  GILMOR
     That's why Camulus was so eager to leave.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill raises the goggles to his forehead.

  O'NEILL
     Can you undo it?

  LEE
     Uh...well, you know we haven't actually...

  O'NEILL
     Yes or no?

  CAMULUS
     I did nothing of the kind.

  O'NEILL
     (chidingly) Cammy.

  CAMULUS
     Worth a try.

  O'NEILL
     Here's the deal. How would you like a chance to

  CAMULUS
     In exchange, you want me to use the Ancient device
     to trade for the lives of your friends.

  O'NEILL
     Exactly.

     The iris opens and Reynolds and the SG team come
     through the Gate.

  O'NEILL
     You're late.

  REYNOLDS
     We thought we'd give it an extra hour, sir. We
     knew it was a long shot.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you, Colonel. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stares at the Stargate, then leaves.

  ONE DAY TO ZERO HOUR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting at his desk, typing. Gilmor
     knocks on the door.

  GILMOR
     Sir. Uh...Colonel Reynolds would like a moment.

  O'NEILL
     Fine.

  GILMOR
     He's in the gateroom, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor walks away as O'Neill keeps typing.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the gateroom to find that many of
     the SG teams are gathered there. He walks up to
     Reynolds.

  O'NEILL
     What's going on?

  REYNOLDS
     General, we just wanted you to know. Whatever you
     decide. We're behind you one hundred percent. You
     just need to give the order and we're ready to go.

  O'NEILL
     I know you are, Colonel. Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks around at the teams, obviously
     moved.

  O'NEILL
     All of you. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves.


LOCATION--SGC LOCKER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting on a bench, having changed out
     of uniform. He moves to his locker and as he
     closes the door, he sees the names on the two
     lockers next to his--Teal'c and D. Jackson. He
     looks at them for a while, then walks away.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     A cleaning bucket and mop is being pushed down the
     corridor. O'Neill turns into the corridor and
     calls for the elevator. Siler walks up behind him.

  SILER
     Goodnight, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Siler turns down the corridor. O'Neill turns
     towards him.

  O'NEILL
     Goodnight, Siler.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets on to the elevator and pushes a
     button. As the doors start to close, the alarm
     sounds. He puts his arm in the doorway to stop
     them from closing and pushes them open.

  VOICE OVER PA SYSTEM
     Unscheduled offworld activation.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     A number of SFs and O'Neill are running along the
     corridor. Gilmor runs to meet O'Neill.

  GILMOR
     It's SG-1's identification code. Sergeant O'Brian
     transmitted a whole signal back through the Gate
     and is awaiting your instruction.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Gilmor enter the Control room and go
     to O'Brian, who is at the monitor.

  O'NEILL
     O'Brian?

  O'BRIAN
     We have audio contact, sir. It's Colonel Carter.

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) Carter?

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of gunfire can be heard over the radio.

  CARTER
     (over radio) We're under heavy fire, sir. Open the
     iris.

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) Negative.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are under attack.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) Can you re-route?


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET

  CARTER
     (into radio) Negative, the DHD is no longer
     accessible.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is crouched by the MALP, shooting at a
     number of Jaffa. Daniel is also shooting.

  DANIEL
     (into radio) Jack, what's going on?

  O'NEILL
     (over radio) You've been in enemy hands.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) You know the protocol. We have
     no way of knowing if your iris code is secure.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET

  DANIEL
     (into radio) What the hell are you talking about?

  O'NEILL
     (over radio) You were captured by Ba'al.

  DANIEL
     (into radio) Ba'al? We're on P2X-887. We were
     trapped in Anubis' secret base. When we came out
     we had Jaffa waiting for us at the Gate.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c shoots a number of Jaffa with his staff
     weapon, then turns to Carter.

  TEAL'C
     It appears these Jaffa are loyal to Ba'al.

  CARTER
     (into radio) Sir, the Gate's going to shut down
     and we won't be able to dial out again.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brian and Gilmor look at O'Neill as he
     considers.

  O'NEILL
     (to O'Brian) Open it.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens.

  O'NEILL
     (into microphone) You're clear.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Staff blasts come through the Gate and hit the
     gateroom. Carter, Teal'c and Daniel come running
     through the Gate.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  O'NEILL
     Nice.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leaves the Control room.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill enters the gateroom and walks up to SG-1.

  O'NEILL
     Hey, guys.

  CARTER
     Thank you, sir.

  O'NEILL
     So...trapped in a secret base, all this time. Go
     figure.

  TEAL'C
     The wrist device allowed us access.

  DANIEL
     We couldn't get back out.

  CARTER
     You thought Ba'al had captured us?

  O'NEILL
     That's what he said.

  CARTER
     How did he even know we were missing?

  O'NEILL
     Reynolds saw an Alkesh.

  DANIEL
     Ba'al must have had his Jaffa looking for the
     base.

  CARTER
     Probably intercepted any radio chatter.

  TEAL'C
     That would explain the ambush.

  CARTER
     Ba'al's Jaffa couldn't find the base, but they
     figured if we turned up...

  O'NEILL
     It's a great story. More importantly...did Anubis
     leave anything cool behind?

  DANIEL
     Not really, no.

  O'NEILL
     Nuts!


LOCATION--SGC CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN. DAY


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and O'Neill meet in the corridor. Carter is
     in dress blues. The corridor is decorated in
     bunting.

  O'NEILL
     Colonel Carter. How are you?

  CARTER
     I'm good, thanks for asking. You're not going to
     dress for the occasion, sir?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks down at himself.

  O'NEILL
     Well, you know me, I love dressing up. I was just
     on my way.

  CARTER
     Sir, I wanted to talk to you...

  O'NEILL
     Carter. Your evaluation is done, and I think you'd
     be very pleased.

  CARTER
     Really?

  O'NEILL
     You had doubts?

  CARTER
     Honestly? I was wondering whether you were
     completely confident in my leadership skills.

  O'NEILL
     Aren't you?

  CARTER
     I've been second guessing myself for ordering SG-3
     to remain at the Gate.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, phshaw!

  ANNOTATION
     They begin walking down the corridor.

  O'NEILL
     Standard recon. Your tactics in dealing with the
     ambush, perfect. You should read what Teal'c and
     Daniel wrote about your conduct under fire.

  CARTER
     Can I?

  O'NEILL
     No.

  CARTER
     Damn!

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c said you were an animal.

  CARTER
     Such an exaggerator.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. Isn't he? Well, this is where I go to take
     off the clothes I prefer, and don the clothes I
     abhor.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill opens the door to the quarters.

  CARTER
     Um...sir, quickly. I...I wanted to talk to you
     about something else. I was reading Doctor Lee's
     report about the tainted ZPM? I think he may have
     underestimated the explosive potential. It could
     have actually destroyed the entire solar system.

  O'NEILL
     What's the difference?

  CARTER
     Well, my point is, if we figured it out so could
     Ba'al. He could use it as a weapon against us.

  O'NEILL
     All true, Carter. Which is exactly why I didn't
     give Camulus the tainted one.

  CARTER
     Sir?

  O'NEILL
     I gave him the dead one. It's worthless, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  CARTER
     Ba'al's going to be pretty pissed at Camulus.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles.

  ZERO HOUR



LOCATION--SGC. O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is sitting at his desk, reading a couple
     of sheets of paper in front of him. Gilmor knocks
     and enters.

  GILMOR
     General, the President's motorcade is through the
     gates. He should be getting on the elevator
     momentarily.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill nods.

  GILMOR
     Uh...Sir, I...I think you should know, I'll be
     leaving tomorrow.

  O'NEILL
     Really?

  GILMOR
     Yes, sir. The truth is, I've been here on a
     temporary special assignment from the President.

  O'NEILL
     Oh?

  GILMOR
     Sort of a civilian audit, if you will.

  O'NEILL
     Of the SGC?

  GILMOR
     Of you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stands and moves to stand in front of
     Gilmor.

  O'NEILL
     I know.

  GILMOR
     You do?

  O'NEILL
     General Hammond told me.

  GILMOR
     Well, he wasn't supposed to.

  O'NEILL
     Well, don't tell anyone.

  GILMOR
     Well, um...then you know the President wanted to
     make sure you were settling in before he came and
     shook your hand and fully endorsed you as the
     leader of this base.

  O'NEILL
     Uh-huh.

  GILMOR
     Obviously, he's here, so...uh...what I mean is, I
     just want you to know how much respect I have for
     what you do here. And for you.

  O'NEILL
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Gilmor nods.

  O'NEILL
     Shall we?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts on his dress blues jacket.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, by the way. Did you let those Amoran delegates
     go?

  GILMOR
     I did, sir, yes. Major Davis said they seemed much
     more willing to negotiate now.

  O'NEILL
     Do you think they liked the fruit basket?

  GILMOR
     I think so, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Good. I put a lot of thought into that.

  ANNOTATION
     They both leave the room. The paperwork on the
     desk is the resignation letter which O'Neill was
     writing to Hammond. Above O'Neill's signature are
     the words, Never mind.
