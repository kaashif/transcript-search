<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The statue seems to be made of stone; a Greek-like warrior standing in a chariot resting between two winged horses. He is holding a lightning bolt, as if about to throw it. There is a noise, and Alekosstares at the statue in disbelief. Beyond the statue is a Stargate with six chevrons lit. The seventh chevron lights up, and the Stargate activates.Alekos runs, looking panicked. Teal'c, Daniel, O'Neill and Carter stand on a platform in front of the Stargate, surveying the room. It appears to be some kind of temple. They walk down the steps toward the statue. O'Neill waves an arm, gesturing to the statue.</td></tr>

Somewhere in the temple, a woman screams.Alekos jumps, disappearing around the column. O'Neill and Daniel, Carter and Teal'c turn. As O'Neill directs his team with hand gestures, Teal'c takes point, and SG-1 move toward the sound. O'Neill and Carter round a column and discover Alekos bent over a young woman, obviously in labor. Teal'c and Daniel come around on the opposite side, Teal'c pointing his staff weapon at the unfortunate couple. The young woman, Thetys, screams in fear, and Alekos moves quickly to defend her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Across from them, O'Neill is settled on a bench and the girls disappear into one of the buildings. Carter, Daniel and Teal'c sit back down, several Argosians at their feet. Music starts to play as Kynthia comes out wearing a sheer, long, sleeveless robe with butterfly attachments and a train. Sticks sewn into the lining rest in her hands; she holds them up and crossed in front of her, so that the material hides her face. Several young women carry the trailing edges of the robe, spreading them out and setting them down as Kynthia comes to a halt in front of O'Neill. Several voices from the crowd cry out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: As the music gets faster, Kynthia twirls and, for O'Neill, the world around her blurs; he can see only her. Kynthia bends down before him, wrapping the wings of her dress around him, close enough to kiss. He stares at her. Kynthia stands and pulls the unresisting O'Neill behind her, leading him into one of the buildings. The villagers laugh and exclaim their appreciation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel, Teal'c and Carter rise to their feet. Alekos approaches them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>ALEKOS: Unto every man the creator gives one hundred blissful days. It is a sin not to celebrate each and every one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Kynthia smiles up at him, just as a gentle kind of alarm begins to sound. People stream into the building. Alekos, Thetys and Dan-el among them. Surprised, O'Neill sits up, pulling a covering over his naked body. No one pays any attention to him, instead lying down to sleep. O'Neill turns to ask Kynthia a question, but she is asleep.</td></tr>

<tr id="L114"><td><a href="#L114">114</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill feels her neck for a pulse, then puts his head on her chest to listen for a heartbeat. Apparently, she has one. O'Neill grabs a blalnket from the bed to wrap around his nakedness while he looks around the room. He walks away from the bed, seeing Argosians lying in deep sleep all around the room, some on beds, some on pillows, some propped in uncomfortable positions on the floor. Carter, Teal'c and Daniel walk into the building.</td></tr>
