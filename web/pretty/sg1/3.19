LOCATION--PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     A young man and woman are chipping rock away from
     what is revealed to be a Stargate.

  YOUNG MAN
     Another one.

  YOUNG WOMAN
     Perhaps the ancestors used it for astronomical
     calculation.

  YOUNG MAN
     A settlement must be nearby.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear the sound of the Stargate dialing up and
     the chevrons along its ring start to light up.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  TECHNICIAN
     Chevron four locked.

  HAMMOND
     (to Carter) Report.

  CARTER
     Sir, we've just got our first hit with the cold
     address program.

  P2X-416.


  HAMMOND
     Prepare the MALP.


LOCATION--PLANET (DAY)

  YOUNG WOMAN
     (worried) We must leave Nyan.

  ANNOTATION
     The final chevron lights up and the event horizon
     shoots out of the Stargate as the two people duck.
     Nyan approaches the wormhole.

  YOUNG WOMAN
     Nyan! You'll drown.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan puts his hand into the event horizon.

  NYAN
     It doesn't feel like water.

  ANNOTATION
     He jumps back as the SGC's MALP suddenly emerges.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel wanders into the Control Room.

  DANIEL
     What's up?

  CARTER
     Cold dialing program made a positive hit on
     P2X-416.

  DANIEL
     I wonder why.

  CARTER
     Looks like the locals have unburied the Stargate
     since the computer last dialed.

  O'NEILL
     Now see, that's what I don't understand. How does
     the computer know how to do that?

  CARTER
     It doesn't, sir. I created the cold dialing
     software to periodically redial cartouche Stargate
     addresses that hadn't connected the first time.
     This is our first hit.

  O'NEILL
     (seeming less than impressed) Oh.

  CARTER
     Receiving MALP telemetry...now.

  ANNOTATION
     The camera on the MALP shows them the planet. Nyan
     wanders into view.

  YOUNG WOMAN
     (off camera) Nyan? What is it?

  NYAN
     I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks off camera.

  DANIEL
     Can you, uh, can you follow him?

  ANNOTATION
     The camera turns to show both Nyan and the young
     women he is with. Daniel puts on an earpiece to
     talk to them through the MALP.

  DANIEL
     Hello Nyan.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  DANIEL
     (through the MALP) Don't be afraid. My name is
     Daniel Jackson.

  NYAN
     Are you a mechanical life form?

  DANIEL
     No, I'm communicating with you through that
     device.

  NYAN
     From where?

  DANIEL
     From another planet.

  YOUNG WOMAN
     This is a trick. We must report this Nyan.

  NYAN
     No, not yet.

  ANNOTATION
     She drags him to one side.

  YOUNG WOMAN
     (whispering) Why?


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  DANIEL
     (to Hammond) Sir, request permission to visit
     P2X-416.

  O'NEILL
     Wait a minute.

  DANIEL
     Jack, they're obviously intelligent. Judging from
     their clothes and tools they appear to be close to
     our level of technology.

  O'NEILL
     And has anyone seen a DHD in this transmission?

  ANNOTATION
     The camera on the MALP pans around, but shows no
     sign of the dial home device.

  CARTER
     He's right.

  HAMMOND
     Maybe you'd better take a naquada reactor with you
     so you can power up the Gate and dial out
     manually.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  NYAN
     (to the young women) MALLIN. I think we've found
     the gateway.

  MALLIN
     There is no gateway. That is Optrican legend.

  NYAN
     Well then how do you explain this?

  MALLIN
     This could be very dangerous, Nyan. Do you realise
     what this would mean?

  NYAN
     It would mean we were wrong. And the Optricans
     were right.

  DANIEL
     (over the MALP) Nyan, is it alright if we visit
     you?

  MALLIN
     (whispering) No!

  NYAN
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     (over the MALP) Ok, we'll be with you shortly.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  DANIEL
     (cont'd, to Nyan) Um, try to stay close to that
     mechanical device I'm speaking through and uh, try
     to avoid that big splash that you saw before.
     It's, it's kind of dangerous.


LOCATION--PLANET (DAY)

  NYAN
     We will be waiting here to welcome you, Daniel.

  ANNOTATION
     Mallin runs off.

  NYAN
     MALLIN, come back! If you tell them, they might
     kill whoever comes through! MALLIN!

LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Carter exit the Stargate carrying a
     naquada reactor, followed by Teal'c and O'Neill.
     The wormhole closes behind them. Daniel approaches
     Nyan, who is waiting for them.

  DANIEL
     Hello Nyan.

  NYAN
     You're human.

  DANIEL
     Yes. I'm, uh, Daniel Jackson, the person you were
     talking to before. This is Major Carter, Colonel
     Jack O'Neill and Teal'c. We're from a planet
     called Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan appears speechless.

  DANIEL
     You alright?

  NYAN
     Then the legend is true.

  DANIEL
     What, uh, what legend is that?

  NYAN
     The Optricans believed that humans were brought to
     this planet by aliens that traveled through a
     gateway. But during the upheaval the gateway was
     buried and things could no longer come through.

  DANIEL
     What was the upheaval?

  NYAN
     A period of violent earthquakes and uh, volcanic
     eruptions covering most of this continent. About
     two thousand years ago.

  CARTER
     So if the Stargate has been buried for that long,
     how did you know where to look for it?

  NYAN
     I was not looking for it. I was hoping to find a
     primitive settlement that was here before the
     upheaval. I was hoping to prove the Bedrosian
     theory.

  O'NEILL
     What's that?

  NYAN
     That human life was created on Bedrosia...without
     a gateway.

  O'NEILL
     Ah.

  CARTER
     So this, this country is called Bedrosia?

  NYAN
     This continent.

  DANIEL
     And then who are the Optricans?

  NYAN
     A rival continent.

  O'NEILL
     Rival as in...what?

  NYAN
     We believe that we were created on this continent
     and the Optricans believe their holy gateway is on
     this continent. Therefore we've been at war for
     decades.

  O'NEILL
     Ok. Carter, you wanna make sure the reactor's all
     hooked up? Just in case. (to Nyan) Mind if I ask
     how close to the front lines we might be?

  NYAN
     A great distance. There's no need for concern.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is keeping watch from the woods. He spots
     three shuttlecraft flying in towards the others.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill!

  ANNOTATION
     He points to the craft with his staff weapon.

  NYAN
     Oh no. No. We have to hide.

  O'NEILL
     I thought you said they weren't around here.

  NYAN
     Those are not Optrican. They're my
     people...Bedrosian.

  O'NEILL
     Good guys?

  NYAN
     Good is not the first word I would use to describe
     the ones that approach.

  O'NEILL
     Uh-huh.

  NYAN
     We must run now.

  O'NEILL
     Ok, Carter, dial it up!

  CARTER
     I need five minutes before I can be operational,
     sir.

  NYAN
     This way. Quickly!

  ANNOTATION
     He runs away, towards the woods.

  O'NEILL
     Screw it. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     They start to run after Nyan, only to be stopped
     by a force-field beamed from one of the craft
     above. O'Neill fires on the craft as does Teal'c
     from his position in the woods, but to no affect,
     and the field quickly collapses around them,
     knocking them unconscious. Teal'c watches but can
     do nothing to help. He takes cover in the trees as
     another shuttlecraft flies over.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are kneeling before
     guards who are holding lance-like weapons on them.

  O'NEILL
     (to a guard) Do you believe we come in peace?

  ANNOTATION
     The guard ignores him.

  O'NEILL
     (to a second guard) Got a commanding officer
     around here?

  ANNOTATION
     The man also ignores him.

  O'NEILL
     (sotto voice) Wow, tough crowd.

  CARTER
     What happened to Nyan?

  O'NEILL
     I'd imagine he's saving his own butt right about
     now.


LOCATION--WOODS, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is still hiding in the woods when he sees a
     guard searching for him. The guard turns away, but
     Teal'c senses another man creeping up behind him.
     He turns and fires and shoots the second man, who
     also fires his weapon and catches Teal'c in the
     face. The guard is killed, while Teal'c goes down
     clutching his face.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     A man exits one of the shuttlecraft. He appears to
     be the commander in charge.

  COMMANDER
     Mallin. You said there were aliens here.

  ANNOTATION
     She approaches him from inside the shuttlecraft.

  MALLIN
     Yes, sir. Those people came through the gateway.

  COMMANDER
     No, they didn't. It's a trick. A contrivance.

  MALLIN
     Perhaps. But one of those aliens named Daniel, he
     talked to Nyan through that machine that came
     through the circle.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to Mallin.

  COMMANDER
     The shuttlecraft will take you to my base. We will
     question you further on this matter.

  ANNOTATION
     Mallin is taken into the shuttlecraft by a guard,
     and two more flank their commander as he walks
     over to the captured members of SG-1.

  COMMANDER
     Either this Nyan fired at my craft or another
     Optrican is out there. Either way I want them
     found.

  SOLDIER
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The commander's aide takes a box containing a very
     large needle.

  O'NEILL
     Ok, that's a needle.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard behind him touches him with his weapon,
     causing O'Neill a jolt of pain. The aide then
     sticks the needle into the side of O'Neill's neck.

  O'NEILL
     Ow.

  ANNOTATION
     The aide takes another needle and repeats the
     procedure with both Carter and Daniel.

  COMMANDER
     Which of you is Daniel?

  O'NEILL
     I'm in command. Colonel Jack O'Neill here.

  COMMANDER
     I am unfamiliar with that Optrican designation.

  CARTER
     We're not Optrican. We're explorers from another
     planet.

  DANIEL
     We traveled through the Stargate.

  COMMANDER
     This type of psychological warfare, simulating the
     Optrican gateway fallacy to undermine our most
     basic beliefs, will not work.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I know that could be hard to believe. So why
     don't you let us show you how the Stargate works
     and if you're still not convinced, we'll just take
     our stuff and go. Fair enough?

  COMMANDER
     (to the guards) Erect a quarantine field.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to walk away.

  O'NEILL
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     The commander ignores him.


LOCATION--WOODS, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is lying unconscious in the woods, but
     quickly wakes when a hand touches his chest. He
     grabs the man by the throat.

  TEAL'C
     State your purpose.

  ANNOTATION
     It is Nyan.

  NYAN
     Nyan.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c releases him and Nyan helps him to sit.
     There are burns marks on his face.

  NYAN
     We have to get away from here.

  TEAL'C
     Where are my friends?

  NYAN
     Captured.

  TEAL'C
     (determined) I will not leave my friends.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts groping for his staff weapon, but can't
     find it.

  NYAN
     We can't get to them. Rigars's set up a quarantine
     field and as soon as he finds the soldier you
     killed...

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan trails off when he realises Teal'c can't see.
     He hands Teal'c his staff weapon.

  NYAN
     You're blind.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     The commander, Rigar wanders over to one of the
     soldiers.

  SOLDIER
     They were starting to dig here.

  RIGAR
     Finish for them. I want to know what's in there.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads over to his aide.

  AIDE
     I have the results from blood analysis. There's a
     ninety-eight percent correspondence. They are
     definitely human. But none of them are showing a
     particle match from the Bedrosian Central
     Registry.

  RIGAR
     Then it proves they are Optrican.

  ANNOTATION
     The woman looks unconvinced.

  RIGAR
     Does it not?

  ANNOTATION
     She doesn't answer.

  RIGAR
     Say what you were thinking.

  AIDE
     What if they are telling the truth? What if it is
     the gateway and the Optricans are right?

  RIGAR
     No, it's a lie.

  AIDE
     How can you be sure?

  RIGAR
     I am sure because we have not spent our lives
     praying to a god who does not exist and many of
     our people have not lost their lives fighting a
     meaningless war. I won't accept that. I have
     studied the book of Nefertum word for word, cover
     to cover. It is the truth.

  AIDE
     What if it's not?

  RIGAR
     It is the truth. We began here. That device is a
     fabrication to fake the Optrican gateway myth.

  AIDE
     To what end?

  RIGAR
     To sow the seeds of doubt among our people. To
     create dissention from within. I will not allow
     our people to have their faith attacked in such a
     cynical way.

  AIDE
     What do you want to do?

  RIGAR
     We will not allow the events that have transpired
     here to leave this place.

  AIDE
     Then we must find this Nyan and the
     fourth...Optrican.

  RIGAR
     Yes. And we'll find out what we can from the three
     we have in custody. Then we will dispose of them.


LOCATION--CAVE, PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan has led Teal'c into a cave.

  NYAN
     I come here for shelter. We also store supplies
     here. Are you injured in addition to your eyes?

  TEAL'C
     I will be fine.

  NYAN
     You can sit here. Here.

  ANNOTATION
     He helps Teal'c to sit and offers him a canteen.

  NYAN
     It's water. It's amazing how one discovery can
     change everything. For years I've been searching
     for proof that we were created on this continent
     by Nefertum.

  TEAL'C
     Nefertum. The blue lotus blossom of Ra.

  NYAN
     He's represented in our texts by a blue lotus
     blossom. But what is Ra? And how do you know about
     Nefertum?

  TEAL'C
     Nefertum was an under System Lord to the one named
     Ra. It is with him whom I did battle.

  NYAN
     I don't understand. Nefertum was and is the
     creator of all of us. He created this planet and
     this great continent.

  TEAL'C
     Correction. Nefertum was an alien who most likely
     brought your people though the Stargate as slaves
     many thousands of years ago.

  NYAN
     That is what the Optricans say.

  TEAL'C
     They are correct.

  NYAN
     Oh dear Nefertum, this is blasphemy. If it is
     true, it could change everything. I must show my
     colleagues at the research academy.

  TEAL'C
     Can you be certain they will believe you?

  NYAN
     They are scientists as I am. They will realise
     they are wrong when presented with the evidence.

  TEAL'C
     Your military has the Stargate in its command.

  NYAN
     Not the gateway. You. You are the proof.

  TEAL'C
     I will not be the proof and I will not allow my
     friends to be imprisoned as they are. (He rises.)
     You must help me rescue them.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan sees blood seeping through Teal'c's clothing.

  NYAN
     Let me see.

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches out but Teal'c bats his hand away.

  TEAL'C
     Do not!

  NYAN
     You could have a serious injury.

  TEAL'C
     I will be fine.

  NYAN
     I have something that will help. I will bring it
     back with the other supplies.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan runs off.

  TEAL'C
     Nyan. Nyan!

  ANNOTATION
     He tries to go after him but runs into the wall,
     disturbing some flying creatures that swarm around
     him. He slumps to the floor.


LOCATION--PRISON TENT, STARGATE CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Daniel and Carter are inside a large
     shelter, imprisoned inside small cages. O'Neill
     tries touching the bars with the sole of his boot,
     but receives an electric shock.

  O'NEILL
     Alright. That hurts.

  DANIEL
     Well this day just keeps getting better and
     better.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.


LOCATION--CAVE, PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is crouched by the wall, holding his staff
     weapon, waiting for Nyan.


LOCATION--PRISON TENT, STARGATE CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar is examining SG-1's equipment. He walks over
     to O'Neill and dismisses the guards.

  O'NEILL
     We should talk.

  RIGAR
     Yes. Let us talk about your friend in the woods.

  O'NEILL
     I have no friends. In the woods or otherwise.

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar is then seen talking to Daniel.

  DANIEL
     We're not spies. We're peaceful explorers. We
     travel through what you call your gateway.

  ANNOTATION
     He is then interrogating Carter.

  CARTER
     Fine, the Stargate then, but that's what we came
     through.

  RIGAR
     All four of you?

  CARTER
     All three of us.

  RIGAR
     It is impossible for one to travel to other
     planets, much less through a circle of stone.

  CARTER
     The Stargate isn't made of regular stone. If given
     enough power, a wormhole forms within the circle
     and that allows us to travel to other worlds.

  RIGAR
     Wormhole?

  ANNOTATION
     It switches back to O'Neill, explaining the
     workings of the Stargate.

  O'NEILL
     Giant worms. Huge.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel then gives Rigar his answer.

  DANIEL
     Wormhole is just an expression. It has nothing to
     do with worms. It's a tunnel through space.

  RIGAR
     And how is this illusion of water created that I
     have heard described.

  DANIEL
     Well you're right in that it is an illusion. It's
     not actually water.

  RIGAR
     Then what is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Each of SG-1 give their own explanations.

  O'NEILL
     Magic.

  CARTER
     It's an event horizon made up of quantum particles
     that form a wormhole.

  DANIEL
     An alien race, the Goa'uld, used the Stargate to
     transport humans from Earth to other planets.
     Which is how your people came to be on Bedrosia.

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar gets annoyed and touches his weapon to the
     bars on the side of Daniel's cage, almost hitting
     him.

  DANIEL
     (as the sparks fly) Ah!

  RIGAR
     My people began on Bedrosia as did yours. We were
     all created by Nefertum.

  DANIEL
     Nefertum. Son of Sakhmet, blue lotus blossom.
     That's who you believe created you?

  RIGAR
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     Well he must have been a Goa'uld.

  RIGAR
     A what?

  DANIEL
     An alien. He must have transported your people
     through the Stargate...ah!

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar hits the bars again, cutting Daniel off.

  RIGAR
     Optrican fallacy. (to the guards) Return him to
     the prison tent.


LOCATION--CAVE, PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan runs into the cave, holding a case. He halts
     when he sees Teal'c, shirtless, with his hand over
     his stomach where the symbiote lives.

  NYAN
     What are you doing? You're an alien.

  TEAL'C
     Come no further.

  ANNOTATION
     He quickly pulls his shirt back on.

  NYAN
     Daniel said you were all human.

  TEAL'C
     Speak of it no more.

  NYAN
     What are you?

  TEAL'C
     As I have said, speak of it no more. I did not
     believe you would return.

  NYAN
     You are the most important thing that has ever
     happened to my planet, although I have not yet
     decided if it is a good thing or bad. I brought
     something for your eyes. It is a healing device
     that, among other things, can regenerate the
     visual nerves. It will help most of your sight
     return within a day. Of course it was designed for
     humans, so how you respond is uh...

  TEAL'C
     (cutting him off) I have no need for it. My sight
     will return on its own.

  NYAN
     Because you are alien?

  TEAL'C
     The others are human. I am a Jaffa. I possess
     within me a symbiote that accelerates healing.

  NYAN
     Forgive me, but you do not appear to be healing at
     all.

  TEAL'C
     My symbiote was severely damaged by my own staff
     weapon blast. It must first heal itself.

  NYAN
     How long will that take?

  TEAL'C
     It could be days.

  NYAN
     Might it not die itself?

  TEAL'C
     It is possible.

  NYAN
     And if that happens?

  TEAL'C
     Then I too will die.


LOCATION--PRISON TENT, STARGATE CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar's aide and two soldiers enter the tent.

  O'NEILL
     Problem?

  ANNOTATION
     They ignore him and go over to Daniel's cage,
     dragging him out. They take him outside.

  SOLDIER
     Move!

  ANNOTATION
     They drag Daniel over to an angry Rigar.

  RIGAR
     (to Daniel) Explain.

  ANNOTATION
     On the floor at his feet is the dead soldier who
     Teal'c shot and killed.

  RIGAR
     Explain!

  DANIEL
     I can't.

  RIGAR
     There is a fourth. He did this!

  DANIEL
     No there isn't, I don't know how this man was
     killed.

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar grabs Daniel and drags him over to where the
     soldiers have dug up another artifact.

  RIGAR
     Explain this.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sees it is the DHD.


LOCATION--CAVE, PLANET

  TEAL'C
     What do your people intend to do with my friends?

  NYAN
     They are evidence that everything my people
     believe in is wrong and that everything the enemy
     believes is right and that is not an easy thing
     for military minds to digest.

  TEAL'C
     Then they will kill my friends and destroy the
     Stargate and deny this event ever occurred.

  NYAN
     Probably.

  TEAL'C
     We must soon depart.

  NYAN
     To do what?

  TEAL'C
     Rescue them.

  NYAN
     You're still blind.

  TEAL'C
     I will manage.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan reaches forward and snatches his staff weapon
     from him.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c Nyan!</blockquote> NYAN You will? [Nyan
     gives him back the weapon.

  NYAN
     I will not be part of a suicide mission. This
     device only works within the first thirty hours.
     Do you want my help or not?

  TEAL'C
     You wish to use me to further your scientific
     aspirations, do you not?

  NYAN
     You are proof that my theories have been all
     wrong...

  TEAL'C
     Then perhaps you would be better off if I were no
     longer alive.

  NYAN
     Teal'c, I'm a scientist. When I find evidence that
     my theories are wrong, it is as exciting as if
     they were correct. Scientific advance in either
     direction is still an advance.

  TEAL'C
     You sound like Daniel Jackson. Do what you can.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan holds up a device and a blue beam of light
     comes out and passes over Teal'c's eyes.

  NYAN
     The pain is the nerve regenerating. It will be a
     moment.

  ANNOTATION
     He switches off the device and Teal'c touches his
     face.

  NYAN
     When I was out I went to a place where I could
     look upon Rigar's camp. Your friends are still
     there. Rigar's men have dug up a smaller device
     that looks related to the Stargate.

  TEAL'C
     The DHD. Perhaps circumstances have become more
     favorable.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks around and sees a blurred shape of light.

  TEAL'C
     There! There, I see a light there.

  NYAN
     Yes, good, then it works on your kind.

  TEAL'C
     But I can only see a faint light.

  NYAN
     That was only the first treatment. We will do it
     as many times as necessary. There's no guarantee,
     but it should help.

  TEAL'C
     Then do it.

  NYAN
     We must wait between treatments or we will do
     damage rather than good.


LOCATION--PRISON TENT, STARGATE CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     Soldiers escort Carter and O'Neill into the
     shelter and force them back into their respective
     cages. Daniel is already inside one.

  CARTER
     Daniel, you ok?

  ANNOTATION
     He just looks at her.

  O'NEILL
     Hey Rigar? You know that 'we come in peace'
     business? Bite me.

  RIGAR
     (to Daniel) You have one last chance.

  DANIEL
     I don't know how that man was killed. We are not
     Optrican spies.

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar takes one of their zat guns and shoots
     Carter. She slumps inside her cage, unconscious.

  RIGAR
     Is there another one of your people out there?

  DANIEL
     I don't know how that man was killed. We are not
     Optrican...

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar fires again, this time on O'Neill. He falls
     back against the electrified bars of his cage,
     unconscious as he is being slowly electrocuted.

  DANIEL
     (desperately) No there is not another one of my
     team out there! Turn it off!

  RIGAR
     What's he look like?

  DANIEL
     Turn it off! You'll kill him!

  RIGAR
     No, you will kill him!

  ANNOTATION
     He is cut off by the sound of the Stargate dialing
     up outside. He thinks for a moment, then walks
     slowly over to O'Neill's cage and shuts off the
     current, before heading outside.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is dialing up as Rigar and the
     soldiers look on in surprise.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is watching the Stargate dial out.

  TECHNICIAN
     (to Hammond) Chevron seven locked, sir, wormhole
     engaged.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate suddenly opens, scaring the people
     watching. Rigar appears shocked.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  TECHNICIAN
     Ready to transmit signal, sir.

  HAMMOND
     (into the microphone)

  SG-1.



LOCATION--PRISON TENT, STARGATE CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     The guard picks up one of SG-1's radios as
     Hammond's voice comes through it.

  HAMMOND
     (cont'd, over radio) This is General Hammond, come
     in. I repeat, SG-1 this is General Hammond, come
     in.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard quickly takes it outside to Rigar.

  AIDE
     It is the gateway.

  RIGAR
     It is not the gateway. It is a trick.

  SOLDIER
     Rigar, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He runs over and hands Rigar the radio.

  HAMMOND
     (over radio) SG-1, please respond. SG-1, please
     come in.

  RIGAR
     (into the radio) Who is this?


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  HAMMOND
     (to Rigar) This is General Hammond of the SGC.
     With whom am I speaking?

  RIGAR
     (over radio) The one who holds your people.

  HAMMOND
     I want to speak with Colonel O'Neill now.

  RIGAR
     You will speak with me.


LOCATION--CAVE, PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan is giving Teal'c another treatment for his
     eyes.

  NYAN
     Almost there.

  ANNOTATION
     He switches off the device.

  TEAL'C
     Our objective is to free O'Neill and the others.
     You will then lay down cover fire to enable one of
     them to dial the Stargate.

  NYAN
     Getting inside the camp is going to be our first
     problem. The quarantine field is only penetrable
     by shuttlecraft.

  TEAL'C
     An obstacle easily overcome.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks down at his hands and sees their blurred
     shape.

  TEAL'C
     My vision is improved. Thank you Nyan.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan smiles and Teal'c gives him a zat gun.

  TEAL'C
     You may use this to defend yourself.

  NYAN
     I have never used a weapon before.

  TEAL'C
     I am confident that you will learn quickly. We
     must depart.

  ANNOTATION
     He stands and walks a little way, almost into the
     wall, but pauses and heads in the correct
     direction.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar is standing before the open wormhole,
     talking to Hammond over the confiscated radio.

  RIGAR
     Tell me, how does this trick work? Is it some sort
     of projection?

  HAMMOND
     I assure you, what you are seeing is real. Now
     please let me speak to Colonel O'Neill. (to the
     technician) Try to pull off the MALP.

  ANNOTATION
     The MALP is inside the same tent where SG-1 are
     being held and the mounted camera pans around.
     Daniel is the only one conscious and he waves at
     the camera, trying to catch their attention.

  RIGAR
     From where do you broadcast? Are you in Optrica or
     within Bedrosian borders.

  HAMMOND
     (over the radio) Once my people are returned, I
     will be happy to discuss an exchange of
     information with you.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at the screen to see Daniel waving at
     them.

  HAMMOND
     (to the technician) See if you can get a clearer
     line of sight on O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     The MALP starts to move, attracting the attention
     of Rigar's aide outside.

  RIGAR
     (to Hammond) You will send the plans for this
     device. You will send the coordinates of your
     position. And when you have exposed your entire
     fraud, I will consider sparing your operatives'
     lives.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees the prison tent moving and heads towards
     it with the others. Daniel tries signaling to the
     SGC, but when Rigar enters, he signals for them to
     cut off transmission.

  HAMMOND
     (over the radio) You will return my people
     immediately. Is that clear?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter are starting to wake up. Rigar
     looks at the MALP.

  HAMMOND
     (over the radio) Do we understand each other?

  RIGAR
     (directly into the camera on the MALP) I assure
     you, if you attempt any sort of rescue, I will
     kill your people.

  ANNOTATION
     He fires the zat gun at the MALP and the camera
     goes blank.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  TECHNICIAN
     (to Hammond) We've lost all MALP telemetry, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Shut it down.

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate closes.


LOCATION--PRISON TENT, STARGATE CLEARING

  ANNOTATION
     Rigar throws the radio and zat gun back onto the
     table with the rest of SG-1's equipment as more
     guards enter.

  RIGAR
     (to the guards) Call in a transport shuttle. I
     want them moved to a more secure facility. Put
     them away until it gets here.


LOCATION--WOODS, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan and Teal'c are heading through the woods, but
     quickly take cover when they hear the approach of
     a shuttlecraft. Teal'c fires his staff weapon at
     the craft and forces it to land.

  NYAN
     Are you sure I should be the one to do this?

  TEAL'C
     You will perform well. Of that I am certain.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors on the craft open and a soldier comes
     out. Nyan shoots him with the zat. A second
     soldier comes out and Teal'c fires at him, but
     misses. Nyan fires again and hits the man. They
     quickly run towards the craft.

  NYAN
     (to Teal'c) Stun, don't kill.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the shuttlecraft and its doors close.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  AIDE
     (to Rigar) The transport shuttle will be here in a
     moment, sir.

  RIGAR
     I will accompany the prisoners back to the base.
     You will remain here to guard the ring. Be sure...

  ANNOTATION
     He is cut off as a shuttlecraft approaches on an
     erratic course. It clips a ridge as it tries to
     land and skids to a halt. Nyan exits and runs over
     to Rigar, falling to his knees.

  NYAN
     Help me! Help me! He's out there in the forest.

  RIGAR
     Who's out there?

  NYAN
     The alien. He killed the soldiers and he tried to
     kill me with his lightning weapon, but I got away
     and I came here.

  RIGAR
     (to the soldiers) Take the shuttlecraft! Find him.

  ANNOTATION
     Two soldiers immediately run for the shuttlecraft.

  RIGAR
     (to the others) Put him under guard.

  ANNOTATION
     A guard takes Nyan into custody. The shuttlecraft
     hasn't yet taken off.

  RIGAR
     (to his aide) Tell them to launch now!

  AIDE
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She heads towards the craft.

  AIDE
     Why haven't you launched this craft?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c appears and stuns her with a Bedrosian
     weapon. The remaining soldiers immediately fire
     upon Teal'c, standing in the hatchway. Teal'c hits
     the man guarding Nyan, even as Rigar runs for the
     cover of a tent. The soldiers take cover behind
     boulders. Nyan takes out his zat gun and shoots
     two of them. He takes their weapons and heads into
     the prison tent where the rest of SG-1 are being
     held.

  CARTER
     Nyan.

  ANNOTATION
     Nyan hurries over and unlocks their cages. He
     hands the captured weapons to O'Neill and Carter.

  NYAN
     Hit the side button to shoot long range.

  DANIEL
     Where's Teal'c?

  NYAN
     He's outside.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel, dial us up. We'll lay down cover.

  ANNOTATION
     They head outside and lay down covering fire as
     Daniel runs over to the DHD and begins to dial. He
     presses the center stone and the Stargate opens.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  TECHNICIAN
     Unidentified traveler.

  HAMMOND
     Close the iris.

  TECHNICIAN
     I'm not receiving a GDO code, sir.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  ANNOTATION
     Still inside the shuttle, Teal'c sees that the
     Stargate is now open and sends the GDO
     transmission.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     The computer receives and reads the code.

  TECHNICIAN
     It's SG-1, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris.


LOCATION--STARGATE CLEARING, PLANET (DAY)

  TEAL'C
     Go!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel runs for the Gate and jumps through.

  O'NEILL
     Carter, go!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter heads after Daniel and gets through safely.

  O'NEILL
     Nyan, can you cover me?

  NYAN
     I will.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill runs over to the shuttlecraft and dives
     inside. Teal'c almost shoots him.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c quickly lowers his weapon.

  O'NEILL
     Look a little rough there, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     Two shuttlecraft are approaching the Stargate
     clearing.

  O'NEILL
     We gotta go. Ready? Go.

  ANNOTATION
     They head out firing. Nyan sees them and starts to
     follow, just as Rigar stuns him. Teal'c
     immediately starts back for him as O'Neill shoots
     Rigar with a zat gun.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c!

  TEAL'C
     He's coming with us, O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     Together, they haul Nyan though the Gate as the
     shuttlecraft overhead opens fire.

  VFX - SHOOTING THROUGH WORMHOLE



LOCATION--GATE ROOM, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     There are armed soldiers awaiting them as O'Neill,
     Teal'c and Nyan come through.

  TEAL'C
     General Hammond, he's a friend.

  HAMMOND
     Stand down!

  ANNOTATION
     The soldiers lower their weapons as Nyan
     collapses.

  O'NEILL
     A little help here.

  ANNOTATION
     Dr Frasier and two nurses rush over to check out
     both Nyan and Teal'c.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY, SGC

  ANNOTATION
     Both Teal'c and Nyan are lying in hospital beds in
     the infirmary.

  FRASIER
     Well Teal'c, all I can say is that Junior is a
     resilient little guy.

  NYAN
     Who is Junior?

  TEAL'C
     That is the name Colonel O'Neill has given my
     symbiote.

  CARTER
     So how are you feeling?

  TEAL'C
     Greatly improved, Major Carter. Thank you.

  O'NEILL
     (to Nyan) Here's some good news. The airforce has
     agreed to get you refugee status, which means you
     can stay here on Earth. With us. If you'd like.

  NYAN
     What would I do here?

  DANIEL
     Well I think we've got a little job for you Nyan,
     if you're interested. I have a backlog of ancient
     artifacts gathered from previous missions and I
     could really use a research assistant. It would
     also be a great way to learn about the history of
     your ancestors.

  FRASIER
     (to Nyan and Teal'c) But for now, you both need to
     rest.

  O'NEILL
     And we'll leave you to it.

  ANNOTATION
     Frasier and the rest of SG-1 leave the infirmary.

  NYAN
     Thank you, Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     You have saved my life, as well as the life of my
     friends. It is I who should thank you.

  NYAN
     I still wish I could have shown you to my friends
     in the science community. They would have been
     fascinated.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps one day the situation on your planet will
     improve and you will get that opportunity.

  ANNOTATION
     He smiles and settles back in his bed.
