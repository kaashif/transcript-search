Inauguration
TEASER

LOCATION--WASHINGTON, D.C, DAY


LOCATION--WEST WING, WHITE HOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     The newly elected President, Henry Hayes, and some
     aides, including Stan, walk down a corridor,
     passing some secret service agents at their
     respective posts. Hayes stops and admires a bronze
     bust of a nineteenth century President.

  STAN
     The Nikkei dropped eight percent last night. The
     Yen continued it's free fall. Also, the President
     of Togo was deposed about six hours ago. He
     managed to get a plane to Nigeria. Now he's
     calling for American troops to help restore order.

  HAYES
     This is my first day!

  STAN
     Yes, Mr. President. The New York Times is about to
     launch an investigation into voting irregularities
     in six Southern states. I've got Teddy on it.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes pauses at a bust of Abraham Lincoln and
     studies the sculpture for a moment while the aide
     speaks. He starts moving down the hall again, Stan
     beside him and other aides following.

  HAYES
     Stan, who are these people following me?

  STAN
     They work for you, Mr. President. Also, there's a
     storm in the Atlantic about to hit the coast of
     Maine. They're expecting gale force winds and
     twenty inches of snow.

  ANNOTATION
     As Stan speaks, Hayes pauses by a bronze bust of
     Kennedy, staring into the statue's eyes before
     rising to his full height and looking at his
     reflection in the mirror above the bust. He
     glances at the aides.

  HAYES
     (to Stan) Shouldn't I know who they are?

  STAN
     Yes, Mr. President.

  ANNOTATION
     They continue walking down another corridor, the
     other aides trailing a few steps behind.

  STAN
     Emergency management teams are standing by, but
     we've scheduled a call to the governor for 10:00,
     so you can pledge our support.

  HAYES
     (looking back at other aides) They're not going to
     follow me around all the time are they?

  STAN
     (smiles) No, Mr. President.

  HAYES
     Good.

  ANNOTATION
     As Hayes and Stan walk into the outer offices to
     the Oval Office, the aides continue down the
     corridor.


LOCATION--SECRETARY'S RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     The President's secretaries rise as he enters.

  HAYES
     Hello. (smiling at one) Holly.

  STAN
     The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is waiting for
     you in your office.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes peeks through the open door to the Oval
     Office and sees General Maynard and a military
     aide waiting for him inside. He turns back to
     Stan.

  HAYES
     (low, to Stan) He knows it's my first day, right?

  STAN
     Yes, Mr. President.

  HAYES
     Good.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes enters the Oval Office.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes and Stan enter.

  HAYES
     Francis.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes sticks out his hand in greeting and Maynard
     shakes it.

  MAYNARD
     Mr. President. We need to talk, sir. It's
     important.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes continues to the sofa, where he takes off
     his dress shoes with a grunt.

  HAYES
     (chuckling) Guys. Let me enjoy the moment.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes stands and wiggles his toes on the Oval
     Office rug in the middle of the Presidential Seal.

  MAYNARD
     (stone faced) Moment's over, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes studies Maynard for a moment.

  HAYES
     Right. (to Stan) Stan, thank you. (to military
     aide) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Stan and the military aide leave the Oval Office.
     Hayes and Maynard sit.

  MAYNARD
     Mr. President, I'm here to bring you up to speed
     on a program we've been running out of Cheyenne
     Mountain for the past seven years.

  HAYES
     I've already had my top secret briefing.

  MAYNARD
     Yes, Mr. President, but not this. (He hands the
     President a classified folder.) Mr. President, for
     the past seven years, the United States Air Force
     has been sending teams to other planets by means
     of an alien device known as the Stargate.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes looks at Maynard for a moment, then begins
     to laugh.

  HAYES
     Ha ha. That's funny. That's very funny. My first
     day. This is a joke, right? I have a great sense
     of humor. I didn't know that you had one, but this
     is good, because we're finding out about each
     other. Now I have to call the ex-President of
     Togo, and when I'm done, apparently the rest of
     the world is coming to an end.

  ANNOTATION
     As he speaks, he rises and moves over to his desk,
     still chuckling.

  MAYNARD
     (stone faced) The ex-President of Togo will have
     to wait, sir. This is not a joke.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes studies Maynard for a moment, then sobers,
     taking a deep breath.

  HAYES
     The United States Air Force has been sending
     people to other planets.

  MAYNARD
     Yes, sir.

  HAYES
     For the last seven years.

  MAYNARD
     That's correct.

  HAYES
     By means of an alien device.

  MAYNARD
     Known as the Stargate.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes sits behind his desk with a sigh.


LOCATION--OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT

  ANNOTATION
     Vice President Kinsey leans on his desk while
     discussing political affairs with his aide.

  SARA
     Senator MacKnight is requesting we move your
     meeting to next week.

  KINSEY
     He's trying to duck me. He doesn't want to commit
     on the crime bill.

  SARA
     What should I tell him?

  KINSEY
     Forget it! The son of a bitch came in on our
     coattails, now it's time to pay the piper.

  ANNOTATION
     The door bursts open and Hayes stands in the entry
     way, incensed.

  HAYES
     What the hell were you thinking?

  SARA
     Mr. President...

  HAYES
     Why didn't you tell me?

  KINSEY
     Uh, Sara, uh... would you excuse us for a moment,
     please?

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey escorts Sara to the door. She leaves and
     closes the door behind her.

  KINSEY
     I take it you've just been briefed by the Chairman
     of the Joint Chiefs on our "new reality."

  HAYES
     (furious) Not only do I find out that the Air
     Force is engaged in interstellar travel, but I
     also find out that my RUNNING MATE KNOWS ALL ABOUT
     IT!

  KINSEY
     I was under a special executive gag order.

  HAYES
     Since when?

  KINSEY
     A little over six years now.

  HAYES
     That's unbelievable!

  KINSEY
     Mr. President, I realize this is a little
     overwhelming right now, but what you really need
     to know is that the Stargate is being seriously
     mismanaged. It's urgent that we act now.

  HAYES
     What are you talking about?!?

  KINSEY
     I have desperately tried to maintain some proper
     control and accountability, but the oversight in
     place is completely inadequate. The military,
     specifically the personnel directly involved in
     the SGC, need to be replaced immediately. Now, I
     have several recommendations regarding...

  HAYES
     Ack! Whoa, Bob! Hold on here.

  KINSEY
     Mr. President, why do you think I was ordered to
     keep quiet? This was a deliberate attempt by the
     military, and-and the previous administration, to
     drive a wedge between us, because they knew I was
     going to come after them. We need to stick
     together on this.

  HAYES
     (incredulous) For God's sakes, Bob! Think of the
     magnitude of this!

  KINSEY
     For God's sake is right.

  HAYES
     Oh, come on, Bob. If you want me to buy into your
     "holier than thou" position, you've got to
     convince me you're right!

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey blinks at him.


LOCATION--WHITE HOUSE, NIGHT


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes sits on the sofa. A pile of blue classified
     files are scattered on the coffee table in front
     of him. He has one file in his hands, skimming its
     contents. Maynard stands nearby.

  HAYES
     (commenting while reading the report) "Hosted
     alien dignitaries"...."Acquired alien
     technology"...."Traveled back in time"?...Did they
     really blow up a sun?

  MAYNARD
     As I understand it, sir, yes they did.

  HAYES
     That's gotta look awfully good on the ol' resume,
     eh?

  MAYNARD
     Yes, sir. They've done some pretty amazing things.

  HAYES
     You sound like a fan, Francis.

  MAYNARD
     Well, I can't help but appreciate the number of
     times they've saved this world.

  HAYES
     (chuckling) Some people think this world wouldn't
     have needed saving had we left well enough alone.

  MAYNARD
     (sitting) Well, you can't deny what's out there,
     sir. The enemy would have come for us anyway. We
     need to be prepared. And no matter what anyone
     says, the people at the SGC have done the best job
     anyone could have under the circumstances.

  HAYES
     You don't trust the Vice President.

  MAYNARD
     (choosing his words carefully) He obviously has
     his own agenda.

  HAYES
     I know he tried to shut 'em down when he was at
     Appropriations.

  MAYNARD
     Well, frankly, I think the Vice President knows as
     well as anyone else it's too late for that. If he
     didn't six years ago, he certainly does now.

  HAYES
     What does that mean?

  MAYNARD
     He clearly doesn't want to shut the gate down
     anymore. He wants to control it.


LOCATION--PENTAGON BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Representatives from various world powers sit
     around a table with Sen. Kinsey, Gen. Hammond, and
     Major Davis.

  KINSEY
     We have a civilian agency known as the NID. Now
     its mandate has been to keep an eye on top secret
     projects like the Stargate program, and has done
     so from the beginning. I propose that we give this
     organization direct control of the Gate, effective
     immediately.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  MAYNARD
     There's only one reason he wanted them to give
     control to the NID.

  HAYES
     Because he was about to become chairman of the
     Intelligence Oversight Committee.

  MAYNARD
     (nodding) Which would have put the NID and the
     Stargate in his back pocket. He had the
     ambassadors eating out of his hands. It was only
     because of some extraordinary intervention that it
     didn't work.

  ANNOTATION
     Thor beams into the conference room. The various
     government representatives look at the Asgard in
     shock.

  FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE
     Hello?

  THOR
     Hello. I am Thor, Supreme Commander of the Asgard
     fleet.

  KINSEY
     (standing) Commander Thor, My name is--

  THOR
     (interrupting) Senator Kinsey. O'Neill suggested I
     send you to a distant planet for your actions
     here, but I am reasonably certain his statement
     was in jest.

  KINSEY
     (lifting his finger) I'm sure it was, Commander...

  THOR
     (raising his own finger) Supreme Commander. It is
     the opinion of the Asgard High Council that
     Stargate Command should be left in the very
     capable hands of General Hammond and his team. And
     while our continued friendship with Earth is not
     contingent on that...it is preferred.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  HAYES
     I wonder why he wants it so badly. I mean, besides
     his belief in his "divine right."

  MAYNARD
     I don't know, sir.

  HAYES
     Not that that's not enough, but...I get this
     feeling that there's something more to it.

  MAYNARD
     (knowingly) Yes, sir.

  HAYES
     That rogue element at NID, that he took credit for
     taking down last year...

  MAYNARD
     We've never had any proof connecting Senator
     Kinsey to anything nefarious.

  HAYES
     I'm starting to get a bad feeling about where some
     of that campaign financing came from.

  MAYNARD
     Mr. President...

  HAYES
     (with false innocence) Did I say that out loud?


LOCATION--WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY


LOCATION--OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT

  ANNOTATION
     Sara lets Woolsey into Kinsey's office. Kinsey
     sits at his desk reading a report.

  KINSEY
     (looking up) Ah, Mr. Woolsey. I hope my confidence
     in you has not been misplaced.

  WOOLSEY
     You have my word, sir. Once I finish presenting
     the evidence, the President will have no choice
     but to follow your recommendation and clean house
     at Stargate Command.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey closes the report and smiles.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Holly opens the door from outside and lets Maynard
     in. Hayes is sitting in a wingback chair in front
     of his desk, a report in his lap. Woolsey and
     Kinsey are seated nearby.

  MAYNARD
     I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. President. I
     was just wrapping up a meeting with the Joint
     Chiefs when I got your message.

  HAYES
     (gesturing to the sofa) Francis, I thought you'd
     want to sit in on this one.

  MAYNARD
     (glancing at Kinsey and Woolsey) Thank you, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Maynard sits on the sofa.

  KINSEY
     General, I don't believe you know Richard Woolsey.
     For the past several months, he has been working
     with the NID conducting a thorough investigation
     of all Stargate personnel. I've asked him here to
     kindly present us with his findings.

  MAYNARD
     If this is a discussion about the competence of
     those running the SGC, shouldn't George Hammond be
     included?

  WOOLSEY
     Unfortunately, sir, General Hammond is part of the
     problem.

  MAYNARD
     (angry) George Hammond is a highly decorated
     officer, a thirty year veteran with the United
     States Air Force. And while that may not carry a
     lot of wait over at the NID, it still means
     something to certain people in this town.

  WOOLSEY
     This isn't a trial, General. Although, it
     certainly wouldn't surprise me if it came to that.

  ANNOTATION
     Maynard bristles.

  HAYES
     Let's stick to specifics here. If these people
     need to be replaced, I want to see evidence.

  WOOLSEY
     (picking up a report) Thank you, Mr. President.
     The most recent incident was less than a month
     ago. General Hammond ordered an offworld rescue
     operation despite ample indication that he was
     sending his people into an ambush. As a result, a
     very valuable member of Stargate Command was
     killed, Dr. Janet Fraiser.

  MAYNARD
     Sending your people into potentially dangerous
     situations is a natural consequence of military
     command.

  WOOLSEY
     Maybe so, but ignoring evidence of an enemy trap
     is at best foolish, and at worst, criminally
     negligent. General Hammond admits his
     responsibility. His own report is essentially a
     confession.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey slaps his folder down.

  MAYNARD
     All that proves is the man had the guts to own up
     to his mistakes.

  WOOLSEY
     Unfortunately, in this case, mistakes can lead to
     compromising the entire planet. I have uncovered a
     mountain of evidence implicating not only Gen.
     Hammond, but his first-line team as well.

  MAYNARD
     (seething) Those people are heroes.

  KINSEY
     We have no intention of minimizing the
     accomplishments of either the General or SG-1.
     Their respective achievements speak for
     themselves. But, intermittent successes cannot
     excuse ongoing misconduct.

  WOOLSEY
     Over the past seven years, SG-1 has shown a
     disregard for military authority. They have
     compromised national security and exercised
     extremely poor judgment in the performance of
     their duties.

  HAYES
     (laughing, to Woolsey) You should be on my speech
     writing team! Come on, cut the crap, will you? As
     crazy as it sounds, we're sitting around here
     talking about people who are fighting aliens,
     right? Could we PLEASE be specific!

  WOOLSEY
     (picking up a file) Yes, sir. Let's start with
     insubordination. Approximately five and a half
     years ago, the Gate was shut down. The SGC was
     under orders to suspend all offworld travel
     pending a full review. SG-1 chose to ignore those
     orders.

  MAYNARD
     And in the process, they managed to head off an
     invasion.

  WOOLSEY
     Nonetheless, they were guilty. And it was by no
     means an isolated incident.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A gate technician stands by her station, and is
     suddenly sedated by Carter, who has sped in and
     injected him with a tranquilizer. Carter starts a
     lockdown procedure and dials the gate at an
     extraordinarily fast speed. Daniel and O'Neill
     have followed Carter in and sedate the remaining
     control room personnel equally as quickly.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel attempt to reach the blast doors before
     they are sealed shut.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate begins to dial. The blast door lowers
     and blocks the view of the Stargate.

  CARTER
     Let's go.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Daniel, and O'Neill enter and wait for the
     Gate to finish dialing. As it activates, Teal'c
     enters.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Not this time, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     The three run through the gate, leaving Teal'c
     standing in the room.


LOCATION--PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel speed through the gate
     knocking the Jaffa unconscious before the guards
     can even see them. The three meet up at the far
     side of the clearing.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  MAYNARD
     They sabotaged a mother ship the Goa'uld would've
     eventually been used to attack Earth.

  WOOLSEY
     They used the Stargate against the direct order of
     a superior officer.

  MAYNARD
     You can't hold them accountable for that. Read the
     damn mission report. They were under the influence
     of an alien device.

  WOOLSEY
     Yes, of course. Which brings us to the alarming
     frequency with which members of SG-1 have fallen
     under alien influence.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey moves a pile of folders closer. He lifts
     the top file off the pile.

  WOOLSEY
     Major Samantha Carter: implanted with a Goa'uld
     symbiote. Then, two years ago, her body became
     host to an alien virus.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     The Entity possessing Carter stands in the middle
     of the corridor, energy emanating from her hands
     and going into the ceiling. O'Neill winces and
     fires his zat. Carter's body collapses to the
     floor.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey sets down one folder and picks up another.
     Hayes shifts in his chair, suppressing a smile.

  WOOLSEY
     Daniel Jackson: fell under the influence of alien
     technology on numerous occasions. Had his body
     play host to not one, but twelve alien psyches
     simultaneously. Most interestingly of all,
     apparently...died and, according to the report,
     "evolved into a higher being."

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes glances at Maynard with bemused incredulity.
     Maynard pointedly avoids the look.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, Jacob, Hammond, and Fraiser surround
     Daniel's deathbed as his body disappears and
     becomes a glowing white energy field which rises
     to the ceiling.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  WOOLSEY
     Teal'c: an alien. Former soldier of the Goa'uld.
     Now possesses full security clearance at our most
     secret facility.

  MAYNARD
     (angry) He earned that trust.

  WOOLSEY
     Yes, that trust almost cost SG-1 dearly when he
     rejoined the ranks of the system lord, Apophis.


LOCATION--GOA'ULD HA'TAK CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Daniel and Carter turn the corner of a
     corridor to find Teal'c standing at the end of the
     hall waiting for them. O'Neill embraces Teal'c
     with a large smile. Daniel and Carter appear
     equally relieved.

  O'NEILL
     Buddy!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c takes advantage of O'Neill's action and
     disarms the Colonel, pointing his handgun at his
     three teammates. Jaffa arm staff weapons and
     appear from the end of the corridor.

  O'NEILL
     (cautiously) What you got going here, Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Apophis turns the corner and approaches.

  APOPHIS
     Well done, Teal'c. Finally you will resume your
     rightful position as my First Prime.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  MAYNARD
     (through gritted teeth) He'd been brainwashed by
     the enemy--

  WOOLSEY
     Yes, like his fellow team members, he too has
     shown a vulnerability to alien influence. Which
     finally brings us to the team leader, Jack
     O'Neill. (Picks up another folder and flips pages
     in it.) Affected by alien contagions a half dozen
     times. Experimented upon by extraterrestrials
     another half dozen times. Had his memories
     manipulated on numerous occasions. Had the entire
     repository of an Ancient alien database
     effectively downloaded into his head.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks into the wall device of the Ancient
     Repository of Knowledge. He sees a strange light
     and starts to back away.

  O'NEILL
     Whoa!

  ANNOTATION
     The device grabs him as if a large hand
     encompasses his head and holds him in place.
     O'Neill frantically grasps at the device to no
     avail. The light approaches. O'Neill cries out in
     frustration and pain. Mere seconds pass, in which
     time his team cannot react. The device suddenly
     releases him, and O'Neill collapses to the ground,
     catatonic.

  CARTER
     Colonel?!?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel quickly approach and check
     O'Neill's condition.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  WOOLSEY
     Not long after this incident, the Colonel began
     exhibiting strange behavior, speaking an alien
     language, demonstrating superhuman intellect. As
     it turns out, he was undergoing some sort of
     transformation as a result of the knowledge he had
     absorbed. Were it not for the timely intervention
     of another alien race, he would've been lost to
     us.

  HAYES
     How these people maintain their sanity is beyond
     me. I'm having trouble just sitting here listening
     to it.

  WOOLSEY
     That, Mr. President, is exactly my point. How can
     we trust these individuals to protect our planet
     after everything they've been through?

  HAYES
     Well, they seem to be handling it very well.

  WOOLSEY
     But who's to say they are completely free of these
     influences?

  MAYNARD
     They're routinely checked and cleared by medical
     professionals.

  WOOLSEY
     We can no longer allow the Pentagon to look the
     other way. The number of times the members of SG-1
     have been compromised should have warranted at
     least a reconsideration of their offworld status,
     transfers to less decisive positions, a couple of
     sick days, for God's sake.

  HAYES
     The first time I heard about this, I couldn't
     believe what I was hearing. I tried to imagine
     myself doing what these people have been doing for
     the last seven years, and quite frankly, I don't
     think any of us can really understand what they've
     been going through, no matter how many files we
     read.

  WOOLSEY
     All the more reason for intensive scrutiny. If new
     protocols and standards of conduct need to be
     established, this is where it has to start.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone watches Hayes for his reaction.

  HAYES
     (nodding in thought) What do you say we take a
     break?

  MAYNARD
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey and Maynard leave. After they are out the
     door, Kinsey approaches Hayes, who has moved
     behind his desk.

  KINSEY
     You can't possibly be taking their side!

  HAYES
     (gathering his thoughts) I need time to absorb
     this, Bob.

  KINSEY
     We may not have much time. The longer those people
     are--

  HAYES
     (interrupting) Relax. All I'm saying is, at the
     moment, I'm going to give them the benefit of the
     doubt. I need to know more.

  KINSEY
     (agitated) I think you know all you need to know,
     and that includes WHY you're here.

  HAYES
     I'm here, Bob, because the people of this nation
     elected me to run their country, not the whole
     damn galaxy. And this is my office, Bob, not
     yours, no matter what you may think you did to
     make this happen. And don't you ever, for one
     second, forget that.

  KINSEY
     (bitterly) Yes, Mr. President.

  HAYES
     Let's take a break.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes smiles. Kinsey turns and leaves. Hayes's
     expression turns serious.


LOCATION--WHITE HOUSE, DAY


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes, Woolsey, Kinsey, and Maynard continue their
     meeting.

  WOOLSEY
     According to the military, Stargate Command is our
     first and best line of defense against potential
     alien threats to this planet, If that's true, we
     should be very, very concerned. Time and again,
     General Hammond and SG-1 have demonstrated
     shockingly poor judgment, placing themselves, the
     base, this very planet in jeopardy. The decision
     to bring back suspect technology through the Gate
     has precipitated a number of crisis situations.
     For the most part, they've been dealt with within
     the confines of SGC. However, last year, the
     effect of an alien device broke containment and
     found its way into the civilian population.


LOCATION--GAS STATION

  ANNOTATION
     Vernon Sharpe finishes sorting cash in his
     register drawer. He reaches out to take a bite of
     his half-eaten sandwich that sits on the counter.
     As he is about to touch it, a strange alien
     centipede- like insect appears through the
     countertop, narrowly missing his hand. It crawls
     over his sandwich and around the front of the
     register.

  VERNON
     (backing up and watching fearfully) Whoa! Son of

LOCATION--A ROAD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill drives down a road, speaking to Hammond
     using a hands-free cellular phone.

  O'NEILL
     Sir, I have reason to believe an individual I came
     in contact with has breached the quarantine.


LOCATION--A DIFFERENT ROAD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A man in a pick-up truck cries out in fear.
     Through his windshield, he sees a large alien
     slug, sitting on the hood of his car, its face
     sucking the window. To any outside observer, the
     slug is not visible. The truck swerves and
     crashes.

  END EXCERPTS



LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  MAYNARD
     The situation was taken care of, a cover story was
     created, and the civilian population was none the
     wiser.

  KINSEY
     Well, I for one, would like to know how many more
     times we're going to have to clean up after these
     people.

  MAYNARD
     They have a mandate to acquire off-world
     technology, and that entails necessary risks.

  WOOLSEY
     And how would you define "necessary"? Only a few
     months ago, General Hammond allowed the testing of
     an unproven computer virus that infected and shut
     down our entire gate network, leaving us open to a
     potential planetary assault.

  MAYNARD
     You can't hold Hammond responsible for that! It
     was a Goa'uld modification of the virus that
     caused the problem.

  WOOLSEY
     In other words, General Hammond effectively gave
     the Goa'uld a weapon to use against us.

  MAYNARD
     Like the President said, you can't even begin to
     understand what their jobs demand of them.

  WOOLSEY
     Maybe not, but I would like to think that it
     includes common sense and the willingness to set
     aside personal feelings in the heat of battle.

  HAYES
     (interested) What are you referring to, Mr.
     Woolsey?

  WOOLSEY
     An incident three years ago, when General Hammond
     allowed emotion to override established Gate Room
     protocol.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens and staff weapons' blasts strike
     the walls of the Gate Room.

  HAMMOND
     Evacuate the Gate room!


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Guards evacuate. Weapons fire strikes the blast
     door as it lowers.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  HAMMOND
     (into broadcasting microphone) Colonel O'Neill,
     we're taking fire. Report.

  ANNOTATION
     A Gate Room monitor shows only weapons fire coming
     out of the active wormhole.

  HAMMOND
     (more anxiously into microphone) Colonel
     O'Neill?!?

  HARRIMAN
     Sir?

  HAMMOND
     Give them some more time.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 run through the Stargate, turning while still
     on the ramp to watch the iris close.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  WOOLSEY
     General Hammond's decision to wait for SG-1 worked
     out in the end. But I can't help but wonder if
     he'll be so lucky the next time.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes exchanges a sober look with Maynard.

  WOOLSEY
     (grabbing another file) The members of SG-1 have
     similarly suspect priorities, and no wonder. Not
     one, but two people that Dr. Jackson had close,
     personal relations with were taken as Goa'uld
     hosts. Teal'c's family and associates among the
     ranks of the enemy Jaffa make him an easy target
     for Goa'uld retaliation and manipulation. And both
     Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter have demonstrated
     an alarming tendency to let interpersonal
     relationships cloud their decision making process.

  HAYES
     They have a right to their feelings. Unless, of
     course, you're suggesting, uh, some kind of
     inappropriate relationship here?

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey begins to shake his head in the negative.

  KINSEY
     Inappropriate, yes! That is exactly what he's
     suggesting. It's difficult to come away from these
     reports without the distinct impression that there
     is a LOT more going on between Col. O'Neill and
     Maj. Carter than simple "friendship and respect".
     For example, there was an example last year where
     Col. O'Neill went missing.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey looks surprised and disturbed at Kinsey's
     comments, then recalls a reference.

  WOOLSEY
     (nodding hesitantly) Based on a report on one of
     the scientists on the mission in question. Maj.
     Carter's behavior was...erratic at best.


LOCATION--RUINS, ALIEN PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     Carter studies a computer hooked up to the alien
     technology. Lee approaches her.

  LEE
     Major, this technology's unlike anything else
     we've come across before.

  CARTER
     (clipped) I know.

  LEE
     (frustrated) We have no reference, no way to
     interface!

  CARTER
     (angry) I'm working on it, Doctor. As you should
     be.

  LEE
     Right.

  LATER


  CARTER
     (angry and sarcastic) Excuse me. Where's Colonel
     O'Neill? I don't see him, do you? Did you guys
     find him while I was gone?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee shakes his head and moves away from her
     temper.

  CARTER
     (furious) I say when we're done here!

  END EXCERPTS



LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  MAYNARD
     That's it? That's your evidence?

  KINSEY
     Oh, I believe there's a lot more to this than
     we've been told. Well, of course, I hardly expect
     them to incriminate themselves with their own
     reports, but we can all read between the lines.

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey nods knowingly. Maynard sighs in disgust.

  HAYES
     All right, I've heard enough. Thank you,
     gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.

  WOOLSEY
     Mr. President.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey gathers his materials and he, Maynard, and
     Kinsey leave the office.


LOCATION--OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT

  ANNOTATION
     Kinsey pours himself a drink. Sara opens the door
     to his office and pokes her head in.

  SARA
     Mr. Woolsey is here to see you, sir.

  KINSEY
     Send him in.

  ANNOTATION
     Sara nods to Woolsey and allows him to enter,
     closing the door behind him.

  KINSEY
     Would you like a drink?

  WOOLSEY
     No, thank you.

  KINSEY
     That was nice work today, Richard.

  WOOLSEY
     Really? I got the distinct feeling it didn't go so
     well.

  KINSEY
     Ah well, it doesn't matter.

  WOOLSEY
     It doesn't?

  KINSEY
     Nah. The President's going to come around.

  WOOLSEY
     I didn't get that impression, Mr. Vice President.
     In fact I clearly sensed that he was siding with
     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

  KINSEY
     (chuckling) Today was a formality. Don't get me
     wrong, the job you did was vital. The President
     has to appear to be hearing both sides,
     considering his position. But...he'll see things
     my way eventually.

  WOOLSEY
     And if he doesn't?

  KINSEY
     (chuckling darkly) Things happen.

  WOOLSEY
     (taken aback) What is that supposed to mean?

  KINSEY
     (pausing) It means you chose the right side,
     Richard. One way or another, I promise you, I'm
     going to win this one.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey looks troubled.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  MAYNARD
     Mr. President?

  HAYES
     General. I take it you're here to make a case for
     the, uh, defense.

  MAYNARD
     I'm not going to get into a point, counter-point.

  HAYES
     Look, it may very well be that Hammond and SG-1
     have done their very best under difficult
     circumstances, but there's a political aspect to
     the Vice President's position that makes a lot of
     sense.

  MAYNARD
     (confused) Sir?

  HAYES
     A lot of people know about Stargate. We can't keep
     it a secret forever. When it finally comes out,
     we're going to be in the fight of our lives. We'll
     need the public's confidence.

  MAYNARD
     And you think cleaning house at the SGC now shows
     you're in control.

  HAYES
     You disagree?

  MAYNARD
     I think there's time for that, still, sir. But,
     for the immediate future, I'm here to let you know
     what you're up against, and why we need Hammond
     and SG-1 right now, more than ever.

  HAYES
     Have a seat and fire away.

  ANNOTATION
     The two sit in chairs across from each other by
     the sofas.

  MAYNARD
     The system lords have proven themselves to be
     formidable adversaries, and yet, despite our
     obvious disadvantage, we've managed to hold our
     own, maybe even take 'em down a notch or two.
     We've been good, and we've been lucky. But I'm
     afraid that could change. There's a new Goa'uld in
     the mix.

  HAYES
     I take it you're referring to the one who calls
     himself...Anubis?

  MAYNARD
     (nodding) He's more powerful than any of his
     predecessors. He came to our attention a little
     over a year ago when he tried to take out Earth
     with an asteroid, and then used our own Stargate
     as a weapon against us. We've thwarted him both
     times. Since then, he's redirected his attention
     to his rivals, waging a year long war against the
     Goa'uld.

  HAYES
     Well, that's good for us. Let them fight amongst
     themselves.

  MAYNARD
     (shaking his head) The problem is, when he's
     through with them, and it's only a matter of time,
     he'll come gunning for us. And when he does, we'll
     be facing a whole new threat.


LOCATION--RAMIUS'S PLANET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Kull Warrior reaches his hand out and breaches
     the force field. He walks through the barrier and
     continues on his way. SG teams and Jaffa fire
     weapons and set off explosions, but cannot stop
     the warrior. The warrior shoots down several
     Jaffa. Reynolds is struck in the shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     Fire in the hole!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill presses the detonator, and a blast of
     explosions surround the Kull Warrior. The smoke
     and dust from the explosions obscures the view. A
     few seconds later, the Kull Warrior emerges as if
     nothing happened.

     battalion groups and bow before Anubis standing on
     his dais.

  KULL WARRIORS
     Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis!


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  HAYES
     If that's true, I can't imagine how having
     Stargate One on the front lines is going to make
     one damn bit of difference when the time comes.

  MAYNARD
     Anubis may be incredibly powerful, but he's not
     invincible. There is a way to take him out.

  HAYES
     And how's that?

  MAYNARD
     By finding the Lost City.

  HAYES
     You'll have to forgive me, Francis. I'm not up to
     speed. I've only gone through about a third of
     those files.

  MAYNARD
     The Gate system was built by a highly advanced
     race of aliens known as the Ancients. They died
     off millions of years ago, but it seems, they
     haven't disappeared completely.

     Why the hell not?

  MAYNARD
     It's beneath them. They won't involve themselves
     in our affairs.

  HAYES
     (nodding) So, where are you going with this?

  MAYNARD
     Last year, SG-1 made an amazing discovery on a
     planet called Abydos.

  DANIEL
     You're going to find the Lost City of the
     Ancients.

  O'NEILL
     Lost city?!?

  DANIEL
     (looking over his shoulder to Carter) Didn't tell
     him about that either, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks exasperated and shrugs with her
     weapon, nodding towards where the enemy waits.

  CARTER
     Daniel found a tablet talking about a lost city.

  DANIEL
     Where there are powerful ancient weapons capable
     of giving you a big advantage over Anubis.

  O'NEILL

  DANIEL
     No, but I'll help you find it.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

     Hammond and SG-1 are close to finding the Lost
     City. Let them do their jobs, sir. Let them save
     this planet one more time.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes and Maynard stand. Hayes sighs and moves
     back behind his desk.

  HAYES
     I wish it were that simple.

  MAYNARD
     (after a pause) I'm not sure what you mean, sir.

  HAYES
     The Vice President may be a pain in the ass, but I
     can't just ignore him.

  MAYNARD
     You're the Commander-in-Chief. It's your decision.

  HAYES
     True, but if I cross him on this one...well, let's
     just say that I haven't viewed all the angles yet.
     Is there anything you haven't told me?

  MAYNARD
     No, sir.

  HAYES
     Then as far as I can tell, Hammond and SG-1 have
     done an extraordinary job under very difficult
     circumstances. But in doing so, they've made some
     mistakes. They've made some enemies. And frankly,
     I don't know if I can protect them.

  ANNOTATION

  MAYNARD
     Mr. Woolsey.

  WOOLSEY
     Thank you for meeting me.

  MAYNARD
     I take it the Vice President doesn't know about
     this.

  WOOLSEY
     No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

  MAYNARD
     What do you want?

  WOOLSEY
     I want to warn you. I think the Vice President may
     be involved with people capable of...well,
     anything. I believe they may have even attempted
     assassination at least once before as a means to
     get what they wanted.

  MAYNARD
     Do you realize the seriousness of what you just
     said?

  WOOLSEY
     Yes, sir. Look, no matter what you might think of
     me, I consider myself to be a man of integrity. I
     took the job with the NID because I strongly
     believe in civilian oversight of top secret
     military operations--

  MAYNARD
     (starting to interrupt) Mr. Wool--

  WOOLSEY
     (continuing) I don't have any proof, sir. But I'm
     starting to question whether those to whom I have
     dedicated my allegiance are as honorable as I had
     hoped.

  MAYNARD
     You're a resourceful man, Mr. Woolsey. If you
     think there's proof out there, find it.

     Hammond slams the receiver down, an expression of
     disgust on his face.

  WOOLSEY
     General.

  HAMMOND
     (skeptical) This must be important for you to have
     come all this way.

  WOOLSEY
     I know you have no reason to trust me, General.
     That's why I felt I had to come here in person.

  HAMMOND
     Sit down.

  WOOLSEY
     I take great pride in my work, General. My job
     demands meticulous research, and above all else,
     impartiality in its execution. My aim is to
     present an air-tight argument, a point of view for
     consideration by those I serve with no personal
     agenda whatsoever.

  HAMMOND
     Get to the point.

  WOOLSEY
     I stand by my case against you and your personnel,
     despite what I'm about to say to you.

  HAMMOND
     I hope you don't expect that to gain my respect.

  WOOLSEY
     (leaning forward) You recall the assassination
     attempt on then Senator Kinsey?


LOCATION--WASHINGTON, D.C., OUTSIDE HOTEL, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Through a rifle scope, Sen. Kinsey can be seen
     exiting a hotel. He pauses by the car and waves.
     The assassin fires. Kinsey is struck. He falls to
     sidewalk, an expression of anguish on his face.
     The crowd panics.

  SECRET SERVICE AGENT
     The Senator's been hit! He's been hit!


LOCATION--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  WOOLSEY
     ...and later gained notoriety for bringing those
     responsible to justice.

  HAMMOND
     I can only assume you're going somewhere with
     this.

  WOOLSEY
     Let's just say...I've recently come to believe
     that those behind the rogue element of the NID
     have not entirely been eliminated. In fact, they
     may be stronger than ever. And Vice President
     Kinsey may still be tied to them.

  HAMMOND
     They tried to have him killed, and then he tried
     to take them down. That seems unlikely.

  WOOLSEY
     At the time, something must have made Kinsey a
     liability. But after the assassination attempt
     failed, the opportunity presented itself to propel
     Kinsey onto the Presidential ticket. That could've
     been enough to motivate a reconciliation.

  HAMMOND
     Either way, I'm not surprised by any of this, Mr.
     Woolsey.

  WOOLSEY
     Well, I'm sorry to say that I am. And I want to do
     something about it if I can.

  HAMMOND
     Like what?

  WOOLSEY
     Like present evidence, if there is any, connecting
     Kinsey to illegal activity involving those behind
     the rogue NID.

  HAMMOND
     What makes you think evidence like that exists?

  WOOLSEY
     Because you're sitting right there.

  HAMMOND
     I'm sorry?

  WOOLSEY
     Three years ago, you left SGC, supposedly retired.
     I'm guessing you were blackmailed.

  HAMMOND
     And?

  WOOLSEY
     And then you came back. Nothing about that ever
     made any sense to me. I want to know why, how.
     You've got something on Kinsey, something I can
     use.

  MAYBOURNE
     That's it. We're in. I'm downloading now. Kinsey's
     online activities connect him to NID actions over
     the last year and a half, including the secret
     operation I ran out of Area 51, the involvement
     with the Russians, and the threats to Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     You're a piece of work, Kinsey. You try to shut
     down the SGC, and you make this big speech about
     how much you hate secret organizations, then you
     jump in bed with the NID. What is that?

  MAYBOURNE
     I'm done.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks over and holds out his hand for the
     disk. Maybourne gives it to him.

  KINSEY

     That's not the only copy.

  WOOLSEY
     Why haven't you given this to someone before now?

     (into phone) Yes, sir. Right away.

  ANNOTATION
     Holly hangs up and looks at Woolsey, who is
     standing by her desk.

  HOLLY
     The President will see you now.

  WOOLSEY
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     She escorts him to the door.


LOCATION--OVAL OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes sits at his desk. Woolsey enters.

  WOOLSEY
     Thank you for seeing me, Mr. President.

  HAYES
     Is there something you wanted to add to your
     report, Mr. Woolsey?

  WOOLSEY
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The President takes off his glasses and leans back
     expectantly.

  WOOLSEY
     As I'm sure you're aware, the NID does not exactly
     have a spotless record. For several years, a group
     of rogue agents operated inside of its ranks. They
     were acting on behalf of a cabal of international
     business interests, intent on acquiring alien
     technology for their own profit.

  HAYES
     One could only hope.

  WOOLSEY
     (confused) Mr. President?

  HAYES
     I know they're out there, Mr. Woolsey. What I'm
     saying is one can only hope that money was their
     chief motivation. However, I doubt the type of
     person who is behind this is short-sighted enough
     for that given what he must know. In light of the
     new reality that Stargate presents, there are
     aspirations beyond mere financial greed that could
     be much worse.

  WOOLSEY
     I agree.

  HAYES
     You're here to tell me that the Vice President is
     still in league with them?

  WOOLSEY
     If these people are as powerful as we both think,
     it does make one wonder what the Vice President
     could have possibly offered them in exchange for
     the price on his head.

  HAYES
     Obviously the full control of the Stargate program
     that the White House affords.

  WOOLSEY
     The Vice President brought key financing to your
     campaign victory. I just hope it didn't come at
     too high a cost.

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey lays Hammond's disk on the President's
     desk and starts to leave. He pauses at the door.

  WOOLSEY
     I also hope history one day shows that I tried to
     do the right thing.

  HAYES
     Whose version of history, Mr. Woolsey?

  ANNOTATION
     Woolsey nods and exits. The President sits in
     contemplation at his desk.
