<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>LANDRY: Colonel Reynolds has been conducting reconnaissance on P9C-882 as part of the on-going mission to track the Ori advance in the galaxy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>REYNOLDS: Approximately four hours ago, the people of 882 were visited by a Prior.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Let me guess: he made them an offer they couldn't refuse.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He unrolls a parchment onto the table. On it are architectural drawings of an Ara, the oval-shaped structure in which Vala was burned. There is Ancient writing on the parchment as well as the drawing. Vala makes a small noise and looks away from it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>LANDRY: (to Vala) I take it you've seen that before.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>VALA: Oh, yes. (pointing at the drawing, to the path the fire takes) They use these to burn people alive who don't follow their rules.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>REYNOLDS: He gave them three days, at which time he said he'd return to check their progress.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>REYNOLDS: Already rejected the idea. They lived under the Goa'uld for centuries. They're not about to give up their freedom again. They've asked for our help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>CARTER: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second. First of all, it's Merlin's device. And second, while I agree the modifications I've made have potential, it's far from ready to deploy in the field on that scale. I'm sure that that's not what the General is proposing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>LANDRY: Actually Colonel, that is what I'm proposing. The IOA has reviewed the reports of your experiments, and they think it's time to take this new technology out of the lab. I happen to agree with them.</td></tr>

Um, basically this machine shifts all matter within a preset range, in this case the entire village, into another dimension. So when the Prior returns, he won't be able to see or hear you. In fact, he'll be able to walk right through you.</td></tr>
