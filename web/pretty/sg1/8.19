<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>DANIEL: Catherine Langford was more than just kind and generous. She had a gift... of an endless, open minded, childlike curiosity. She saw the world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And she saw potential in people that others failed to recognize. Like her father before her, her contributions to science have changed the world more than most people know. I, for one, have no idea where I would be today if I'd never met her. She changed my life in more ways than I ever could have imagined.</td></tr>

Now, while I was flipping through the pages, I noticed this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>CARTER: We did an extensive satellite sweep of the Giza Plateau searching for an energy signature like the one given off by the ZPM we found near Taonas.
