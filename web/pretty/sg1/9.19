<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>VALA: Not as important as what I have to tell you, believe me. I'll try and be as quick as I can, and then you can have Daniel back. I promise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Carter brushes her finger over her nose. Vala takes the hint and wipes the tip of her nose with her hand, then licks her hand. Carter nods but is vaguely disturbed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L110"><td><a href="#L110">110</a></td><td>VALA: Thanks. I do realize he was a devout Ori follower and probably would have been standing on the front line cheering while they burnt me to death if he knew the truth about me, but he was very sweet in his own way.

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>VALA: (voiceover) I think Tomin had been on his own before I came along mostly due to a limp that had left him crippled since childhood. He didn't like to talk about it much, but I could see that the other villagers looked down on him because of it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: As she speaks, she watches Tomin walk down the street limping. The other villagers don't pay him much attention as they encounter him, and he must step out of their way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L114"><td><a href="#L114">114</a></td><td>VALA: (voiceover) In their minds, the Ori must have deemed him unfit for normalcy, so that's how they chose to see him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L115"><td><a href="#L115">115</a></td><td>VALA: I did my best to blend in. At first, according to Tomin and therefore as far as the villagers were concerned, I was the woman who fell from the sky. Which made me feel kind of special. I later learned that they always suspected I'd escaped from another village as a result of some scandal, and then I started to feel much more like I'm used to.</td></tr>

<tr id="L120"><td><a href="#L120">120</a></td><td>VALA: (voiceover) So, I figured my best bet was to root out any of Fannis's gang from the anti-Ori underground. See if they had any technology or any information about an Ori Stargate I might possibly get access to.</td></tr>

<tr id="L122"><td><a href="#L122">122</a></td><td>VALA: (voiceover) But I had to be very careful. The village was run by this complete bear of a man named Seevis, who was both barkeep and administrator. Which seemed the oddest contradiction! He claimed to be the most pious man in the village. If anyone strayed from the path of righteousness, it was Seevis who made sure you were severely punished for it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L123"><td><a href="#L123">123</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Seevis approaches and passes a bar maid dressed in a low-cut dress and speaking to a male patron.</td></tr>
