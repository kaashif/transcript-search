  ANNOTATION
     A large snow vehicle is being driven towards the
     domed base.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Dr. Michaels are conversing over a
     video link.

  MICHAELS
     It's a blip. A shadow on the ultrasound. Too deep
     to tell. You know, maybe a...a dead seal. Anyway,
     we're, uh, we're gonna rule it out and pack up for
     the season. Another week or two, it'll be dark
     most of the time, much too cold to work outside.
     As far as coming back next year, well, you know
     it's not up to me. The Pentagon reevaluates our
     presence here every year. Take it up with them.

  CARTER
     (Over the monitor) Well, maybe my new conclusions
     about the DHD will be enough to convince them that
     we should continue.


LOCATION--SGC CARTER'S LABORATORY

  MICHAELS
     (over the monitor) I'm sure coming from you, it'll
     hold more weight.

  CARTER
     The one found with the Antarctic Gate died shortly
     after it was brought back to Area 51. It was used
     a few times and then just ran out of energy. That
     was the first indication we had that the power
     sources fueling the Gate technology have a limited
     life span. We've run a number of tests comparing
     the power source to other off world DHDs. We think
     we now have evidence that the Gate we found down
     there is one of the oldest in the entire system.
     It could be as much as 50 million years old.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE

  MICHAELS
     The Antarctic plate wasn't covered by a glacier
     back then. It wasn't even at the South Pole.


LOCATION--SGC CARTER'S LABORATORY

  CARTER
     Well, the Gate didn't necessarily originate there.
     It could have been moved from another planet at
     any point in time, but that's what we need to try
     and determine.

  MICHAELS
     (over the monitor) How?

  CARTER
     There has to be something else down there.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels sighs, frustrated.

  MICHAELS
     I mean we've been here four years running. Since
     we dug out those two Jaffa we've found nothing. If
     this latest lead turns out to be...

  ANNOTATION
     A door opens.

  FIRST MAN
     Hey Michaels, the thing in the ice.

  SECOND MAN
     It's something.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels looks at the two men, surprised, as they
     smile.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1, with Fraiser, have just arrived at the
     Antarctic Base. Jonas pauses and looks back.

  JONAS
     Why's the plane leaving?

  O'NEILL
     Cold's no good for the electronics. It'll be back.

  JONAS
     When?


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE

  ANNOTATION
     As they get under cover, Michaels and the two men
     approach them.

  O'NEILL
     Let's ask these folks.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Michaels shake hands.

  CARTER
     Hi.

  MICHAELS
     Hi. It's nice to finally meet you, Major.

  CARTER
     You too. Dr, Michaels, this is Dr. Fraiser.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels shakes hands with Fraiser.

  MICHAELS
     Doctor.

  FRAISER
     Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Michaels introduces her colleagues.

  MICHAELS
     Uh...Doctors Woods and Osbourne.

  FRAISER
     Doctor.

  WOODS
     Doctor.

  OSBOURNE
     Major.

  CARTER
     Doctor.

  WOODS
     Major.

  FRAISER
     Doctor.

  O'NEILL
     All right. That's enough.

  OSBOURNE
     Well, welcome to Antarctic, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Thanks. Great to be back.

  OSBOURNE
     Let's go inside.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk from the snow-covered entryway into the
     body of the building.

  JONAS
     How long is this gonna take?

  WOODS
     A few days, maybe more. Why?

  JONAS
     Long range forecast doesn't look good.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, walking slightly ahead of Jonas and
     Fraiser, whispers to Michaels.

  CARTER
     Bit of a weather freak.

  MICHAELS
     (quietly) He'll love it here.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the building. Jonas begins to unzip his
     jacket.

  MICHAELS
     Uh...you might want to leave your coats on. We're
     keeping the quarantine lab below freezing to
     maintain the specimen.

  WOODS
     We thought you'd want to see it right away.

  CARTER
     Absolutely.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels begins a brief tour of the base.

  MICHAELS
     As you can see, we're quite well equipped. We have
     a research lab, observation room, and in here, the
     quarantine lab.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the quarantine lab where a large block
     of ice is lying on a table. There is something
     within the ice.

  WOODS
     After digging up those Jaffa the first year, we
     expected to find a lot more a lot faster.

  ANNOTATION
     They all stand around the table.

  MICHAELS
     I named her Ayiana. Means eternal bloom.

  JONAS
     Native American Indian?

  MICHAELS
     Mm hmm. My grandfather was one-quarter Cherokee.

  FRAISER
     How do you know it's a she?

  MICHAELS
     Ultrasound.

  WOODS
     You're guessing.

  MICHAELS
     The form appears to be female, although, I admit,
     it's hard to tell for sure.

  FRAISER
     Have you, uh, have you made a guess about her age?

  MICHAELS
     Mm...25 to 35?

  OSBOURNE
     Give or take several million years.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks up from studying the ice block,
     surprised.

  CARTER
     Several million?

  WOODS
     That's what the preliminary analysis of the oxygen
     content in the ice indicates.

  JONAS
     Yeah, but didn't humans evolve on this planet
     somewhere between 8 and 9 hundred thousand years
     ago?

  MICHAELS
     That's what we thought.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks pleasantly surprised.

  FRAISER
     Oh, this could be big.

  MICHAELS
     (to Carter) As you said, evidence now points to
     the Stargate found here predating the glacier.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods her head in agreement.

  TEAL'C
     The Jaffa found near the Stargate could not have
     been frozen there that long ago.

  MICHAELS
     Not even close.

  JONAS
     Dr. Jackson theorized that when the Gate from Giza
     was buried roughly 2000 years ago that the Goa'uld
     managed to open up the Antarctic Gate.

  CARTER
     Well, that's because a crevasse was formed. It
     allowed the wormhole to connect and ultimately
     create a larger opening. The Jaffa were frozen
     after that.

  FRAISER
     But she wasn't.

  MICHAELS
     Much before that.

  TEAL'C
     So she's neither Jaffa, nor Goa'uld.

  MICHAELS
     Well, whoever this is, she was probably around
     when the Antarctic Gate was first being used.

  OSBOURNE
     We need to take more core samples to determine if
     she was actually frozen in the same vein.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser has walked around the ice block, studying
     it. Standing next to Michaels, she fingers a hole
     in the ice.

  FRAISER
     Did you do a tissue sample?

  MICHAELS
     Mm hmm. I'd like you to have a look.

  O'NEILL
     Listen. Could somebody bottom-line this for me?

  FRAISER
     Well, Sir, we could be looking at evidence that
     human beings evolved long before we thought they
     did.

  MICHAELS
     And maybe not even originally on this planet.

  O'NEILL
     Darwin would be crushed.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c walk into a room containing a
     screen showing the observation lab, and an area
     for clothing. O'Neill throws up his hands in
     frustration.

  O'NEILL
     Doh!

  TEAL'C
     What is it O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     I forgot to tape The Simpsons.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c does not react, but simply looks at
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     It's important to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c turns away, eyebrow raised.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--RESEARCH LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Dr. Fraiser is looking into a high-powered
     microscope. Michaels is sitting next to her.

  FRAISER
     This is incredible.

  MICHAELS
     I know. No adipocere.

  JONAS
     What's that?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is sitting behind them. Another screen shows
     the ice block in the observation lab.

  FRAISER
     It's a residue that forms on dead animal tissue
     when exposed to moisture.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser rolls her chair away from the table to
     face Jonas and Michaels.

  FRAISER
     But that's not the most amazing part. These tissue
     cells are intact.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks amazed.

  MICHAELS
     That's what I was hoping you'd say. I thought
     maybe I was losing my mind.

  JONAS
     I'm sorry...uh, what?

  FRAISER
     When you freeze live cells, crystals form and
     ultimately destroy the integrity of the cell.
     That's why we haven't been able to develop a
     viable method of human cryogenic preservation.

  JONAS
     So...

  FRAISER
     So...these cells are perfect. They could be from
     you or me.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser and Michaels are wearing surgical masks
     and latex gloves. They manoeuvre an overhanging
     heat lamp over the block of ice as the others
     watch in the adjoining observation room. The ice
     begins to slowly melt. Time goes by as water
     slowly drips from the block. A monitor in the
     observation room shows the temperature slowly
     increase to fifty degrees.

  MICHAELS
     (speaking into a headset microphone--documenting
     the procedure) Right hand, right arm and partial
     head exposed. The clothing appears tailored.
     Material unknown.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is also speaking into a head-mike.

  FRAISER
     Peeling back what appears to be the right sleeve
     covering the face.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser slowly removes the cloth with large
     tweezers, revealing a perfectly preserved female
     face, still partially frozen into the ice.

  FRAISER
     (to Michaels) You got it?

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels folds the cloth away from the face.

  MICHAELS
     Yeah.

  FRAISER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks at the woman, amazed.

  FRAISER
     She is remarkably preserved.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser shines her penlight into one of Ayiana's
     eyes. The pupil reacts to the light. Fraiser,
     stunned, flicks off the light and looks at
     Michaels. Both look shocked. Fraiser again shines
     the penlight into the eye and again the pupil
     reacts. She turns to the observation room window.

  FRAISER
     I got a cortical response. Sam, I need your help!

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels wheels a machine towards the table.

  FRAISER
     Let's go.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--OBSERVATION ROOM

  JONAS
     (to Carter) What's goin' on?

  CARTER
     Electroencephalogram. It measures brain-wave
     activity.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter puts on a mask and leaves the observation
     room.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana is being prepared for the EEG, with leads
     being placed on her head.

  MICHAELS
     All right, go, Sam.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter switches on the equipment, and immediately
     one of the lines on the monitor shows wave
     activity.

  CARTER
     Delta waves.

  MICHAELS
     That's impossible!

  CARTER
     We've seen stranger.

  FRAISER
     We've gotta get her out.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill in the observation room) Sir, crank up
     the heat!


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns to a panel at his right and rotates
     the controls.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     The heat lamps switch on to a high setting. A
     monitor shows the temperature increasing to 79
     degrees. The ice around Ayiana has mostly melted.

  FRAISER
     On three. When you're ready, Jonas.

  ANNOTATION
     Hands move to Ayiana's shoulder and arm, ready to
     lift her.

  JONAS
     Okay.

  FRAISER
     Okay. One, two, three.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas and Carter lift Ayiana's upper body,
     Michaels her legs. They move her onto a gurney.

  FRAISER
     Easy.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves the heat lamp to over Ayiana's body.

  CARTER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels checks Ayiana's temperature with an ear
     thermometer.

  MICHAELS
     Temperature is 73 degrees.

  FRAISER
     Good.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is cutting away Ayiana's clothing.

  FRAISER
     No sign of frostbite. I assume you don't have
     bypass?

  MICHAELS
     No.

  FRAISER
     Okay, let's try, uh, warm saline, one milligram
     epi, and do a blood gas.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels nods in agreement and moves away from the
     gurney, as do Fraiser, Carter and Jonas. O'Neill
     looks on from the observation room.

  MICHAELS
     You know the medics have a saying down here.
     You're not dead until you're warm and dead.

  FRAISER
     It's because anything below 82 degrees and life
     signs are often undetectable.

  ANNOTATION
     They are preparing to give Aiyana an EKG.

  MICHAELS
     Okay, we've got disorganized electrical activity.

  FRAISER
     I'm intubating. Tilt her head, Sam.

  ANNOTATION
     A monitor in the observation room shows Fraiser
     inserting the respiration tube guide into Ayiana's
     throat.

  FRAISER
     I'm in...give me the tube. That's it...okay.

  ANNOTATION
     As the bag is massaged, the medical monitor bleeps
     and shows a heartbeat.

  MICHAELS
     There's a heartbeat.

  JONAS
     Hey, uh, she's bleeding.

  ANNOTATION
     The blanket around Ayiana's arm is drawn away to
     show a small, bleeding wound.

  FRAISER
     Sam, you take over bagging?

  CARTER
     Got it.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser bandages the wound.

  MICHAELS
     PH is 6.9. She's acidotic, but her PO2 is 98.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks up at the heart monitor.

  CARTER
     Ten beats per minute.

  ANNOTATION
     As Fraiser looks across to the heart monitor, the
     regular beeping turns continuous and Ayiana's
     heartbeat flatlines. Suddenly the monitor
     flat-lines.

  FRAISER
     She's in V-fib

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser sets up the defibrillator as Michaels
     walks over to the monitor.

  FRAISER
     Charging to 200.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser grabs the paddles and prepares to "shock"
     Aiyana.

  FRAISER
     And clear...

  MICHAELS
     Wait!

  ANNOTATION
     The continuous beeping has been replaced by
     regular beeps. Fraiser turns to see a heartbeat on
     the monitor.

  FRAISER
     Sinus bradycardia.

  MICHAELS
     30 beats per minute. BP 60 over 40 and rising. I
     can't believe this is happening.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly Aiyana blinks her eyes. Carter looks at
     her, amazed.

  CARTER
     She's conscious.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks at Carter, shocked, while O'Neill
     looks on from the observation room.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     The scene is from Ayiana's perspective. Fraiser
     and Carter, looking down at her, are indistinct.
     Ayiana's breathing is loud.

  FRAISER
     She's breathing on her own.

  ANNOTATION
     As an oxygen mask is removed, Michaels and Jonas
     appear over her.

  JONAS
     I think we're scaring her.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana looks around, obviously frightened. There
     are EEG leads still attached to her head, and a
     tube down her throat.

  JONAS
     It's okay. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Shhh. Can we
     take the tube out?

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana flinches away as Jonas lays his hands on
     the gurney.

  FRAISER
     Yeah. It's okay. Sam, give me a hand.

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana is gasping, obviously scared. Fraiser moves
     to the head of the gurney to remove the tube from
     Ayiana's throat.

  FRAISER
     Easy...easy...hang on.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels attempts to comfort Aiyana by rubbing her
     legs as Fraiser removes the tube. O'Neill,
     Teal'c,Osbourne and Woods look on from the
     observation room.

  FRAISER
     Take it easy. It's okay. It's okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser removes the tube, causing Aiyana to cough
     several times, then take deep breaths.

  FRAISER
     It's okay. There you go.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly, Ayiana begins convulsing.

  FRAISER
     Oh, ho, whoa! Michaels, 2.5 milligrams Valium.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels moves to inject the drug in the IV line,
     while Carter, Fraiser and Jonas hold down Aiyana.

  FRAISER
     Easy, nobody's gonna hurt you. It's okay. Okay.
     Here we go.

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana clams as the drug takes affect.

  FRAISER
     Here we go. Yeah.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--RESEARCH LABORATORY

  FRAISER
     We didn't do anything, Sir. She revived herself.
     It was as if the thawing process just triggered an
     internal response telling her body to come back to
     life.

  O'NEILL
     But not a snakehead, right?

  FRAISER
     No, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     All right. Then what are we dealin' with here?

  FRAISER
     Something not humanly possible. Not as far as I
     know.

  TEAL'C
     Then she may indeed be not of this world.

  CARTER
     As far as we knew up until now, all human life in
     the galaxy was transplanted to other planets from
     Earth by the Goa'uld. Now, the odds of a totally
     alien life form evolving to look exactly like us
     are...are astronomical.

  JONAS
     Actually, if she's as old as we think she is,
     wouldn't it be us evolving to look like her?

  CARTER
     True.

  WOODS
     We really need to check out the site again. At
     least get another core sample to prove the age of
     the ice.

  O'NEILL
     You guys need some help?

  OSBOURNE
     We can handle it.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels enters from the Quarantine Lab.

  MICHAELS
     Uh...she's awake again.

  JONAS
     Think I'll try talking to her.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill nods in agreement.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana is lying on the gurney, looking drowsy and
     dressed in green medical scrubs. Her arms are
     restrained at her sides. Jonas and Michaels enter,
     both wearing surgical masks.

  JONAS
     Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana appears scared, moving away slightly on the
     gurney. Jonas lowers his mask a little, looks at
     Michaels and then removes the mask completely.

  JONAS
     It's...uh...Jonas.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas smiles at her. Michaels also removes her
     mask.

  MICHAELS
     Francine.

  JONAS
     (to Michaels) We don't need these restraints
     anymore, do we?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas removes the restraint on her left wrist as
     Michaels moves around the other side of the
     gurney.

  JONAS
     It's all right, it's all right. It's better, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels removes the restraint from her right
     wrist.

  JONAS
     (to Michaels) Want to sit her up?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas and Michaels support Ayiana's back as they
     help her into a sitting position.

  JONAS
     Can you speak? You speak?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas also gestures with his hands, indicating a
     movement from the throat.

  MICHAELS
     Uh, maybe she just doesn't understand us.

  JONAS
     I'd be very surprised if she did, but that doesn't
     mean we can't communicate, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas points to himself.

  JONAS
     I'm Jonas.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana looks puzzled.

  JONAS
     Jonas. It's my name.

  AYIANA
     Jo...Jo--nas.

  JONAS
     Yeah.

  MICHAELS
     I guess she can speak.

  JONAS
     Jonas, though, Jonas is my name. It's my name.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas points to Michaels.

  JONAS
     Francine is her name. Do you have a name? Hmm?

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana raises her right sleeve to look at the
     bandage on her bicep.

  JONAS
     That bothering you?

  MICHAELS
     Oh, that's my fault. I'm sorry.

  AYIANA
     S...Sor-ry?

  JONAS
     Yeah, sorry. It's what you say to somebody when
     you, uh, cause them pain or sadness or you've done
     something you feel bad about.

  MICHAELS
     We didn't know. Let me have a look? It's okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels raises the sleeve and removes the
     bandage. There is no longer a wound on the arm.

  MICHAELS
     That's amazing.

  AYIANA
     Am-a-zing.

  MICHAELS
     Yes, you are.

  AYIANA
     (to Jonas) Am-a-zing.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas smiles and nods in agreement.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--RESEARCH LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is sitting at a monitor.

  CARTER
     The weather system Jonas was worried about is
     blowing in more quickly than first predicted.

  O'NEILL
     (into radio) Woods, Osbourne, this is O'Neill.
     Come in.

  WOODS
     (over radio) Yeah, Colonel, I read you.

  O'NEILL
     (into radio) That storm is headed our way.

  WOODS
     (over radio) Roger that. We're almost done here.
     It'll be dark soon anyway.

  ANNOTATION
     Michaels and Jonas enter the lab.

  WOODS
     (over radio) Just...be back in a couple of hours.
     Woods out.

  JONAS
     Well, we didn't really learn anything.

  O'NEILL
     Nothing?

  JONAS
     No, no, not even her name. There's obviously a
     communication barrier. She can speak, but, uh...

  FRAISER
     There's really no telling what the effects of
     being frozen that long are. Even with her ability
     to...uh...preserve or heal herself physically,
     parts of her mind could have been damaged beyond

  MICHAELS
     The wound on her arm is completely gone.

  FRAISER
     What?

  MICHAELS
     I mean, if we can figure out how she's able to
     regenerate...

  TEAL'C
     Could she not be deliberately hiding something?

  JONAS
     What reason would she have to hide anything?

  CARTER
     Fear.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana is sitting up on the gurney, with Michaels
     standing next to her. Jonas enters, carrying a
     tray.

  JONAS
     I thought you might be hungry. I brought you
     some...uh...food.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana looks puzzled.

  JONAS
     You eat it.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas picks up some food from the tray and eats
     it.

  JONAS
     It's not very good, but, uh...try it.

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana takes the tray from Jonas and eats some of
     the food. She shakes her head and grimaces. She
     selects a small amount of different food from the
     tray.

  JONAS
     That's not much...

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana starts to greedily eat the food.

  JONAS
     ...better. I guess if you've been frozen for that
     many years...

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana stares at him as she continues eating.
     Michaels removes her jacket, obviously warm.

  JONAS
     You all right?

  MICHAELS
     Yeah, yeah. I just think we have the heat turned
     up a little high in here now.

  JONAS
     (to Aiyana) Hey, I want to show you
     something...uh...here, look, look.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas shows Ayiana a notebook, opened to a page
     with a drawing of a Stargate. He points to the
     drawing.

  JONAS
     Have you ever seen this? Yes? No?

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana slows her eating and looks at the drawing.

  AYIANA
     Amazing.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas appears a little frustrated.

  JONAS
     We're going to try something else.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters and joins Fraiser at a terminal.

  FRAISER
     Look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows different brain wave patterns.

  CARTER
     What are they?

  FRAISER
     EEGs I took of Cassandra when she was suffering
     the effects of Niirti's genetic experiment.

  CARTER
     Cassie started developing telekinetic abilities.

  FRAISER
     Mm hm. These are the ones I took of Colonel
     O'Neill when he had the knowledge of the Ancient
     repository downloaded into his brain. Now, I've
     been comparing them...to Ayiana's...

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser brings up another brain wave pattern on
     the screen.

  CARTER
     Connection?

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser nods.

  CARTER
     Okay, Niirti was trying to create genetically
     enhanced human beings. And the Ancient device was
     rewriting Colonel O'Neills memory until the Asgard
     put a stop to it.

  FRAISER
     It was doing more than that. It was activating
     dormant areas of his brain. Sam, look, what if
     there's more than just a coincidental similarity
     in these patterns?

  CARTER
     So you're saying this woman is...?

  FRAISER
     I'm saying that she's another example of an
     advanced stage in the potential human evolutionary
     process.

  CARTER
     Leading to what?

  FRAISER
     Antarctic cod can live in water so cold, other
     fish would develop ice crystals in their blood.
     Now, they've had 40 million years or so to adapt
     to the change of temperature in the water and
     they've developed this protein that acts like
     anti-freeze.

  CARTER
     They're fish.

  FRAISER
     Given enough time, evolution can do some pretty
     amazing things. Look, we know that humans can
     become much more powerful beings. We've seen it
     happen with Daniel.

  CARTER
     Uh huh, with the help of other powerful beings.

  FRAISER
     Yes. We think this woman might predate human
     evolution on Earth by 50 million years.

  CARTER
     Yeah, but that would put her behind us on the
     evolutionary timeline, not way ahead.

  FRAISER
     Unless...

  CARTER
     Unless...our evolution isn't the first time it's
     happened. That's not big, Janet, that's huge!

  FRAISER
     Okay, look, it's just a theory and we certainly
     don't have any hard evidence, yet.

  CARTER
     Yeah, yeah, but if you're right! This woman could
     be part of the race that first invented the Gate.

  FRAISER
     One stage of their development, anyway.

  CARTER
     A living Ancient.

  FRAISER
     And we look just like her.

  CARTER
     That could mean that...that our evolution wasn't
     just some biological accident.

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor behind Fraiser is showing the
     quarantine lab. Michaels has just collapsed to the
     floor. Jonas yells up into the camera, drawing
     Carter and Fraiser's attention.

  JONAS
     Dr. Fraiser!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Fraiser leave the lab and can be seen
     over the monitor entering the quarantine lab.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser enters from the infirmary which is
     immediately next door. O'Neill and Carter are
     sitting at a small table.

  FRAISER
     Michaels fainted. She's running a high fever. I
     need to do more tests.

  CARTER
     Aiyana?

  FRAISER
     She's fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is sitting at a monitor.

  FRAISER
     I know what you're thinking.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  FRAISER
     It's possible she may be carrying a contagion of
     some kind.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill grimaces at Carter.

  TEAL'C
     Would she not also be ill?

  FRAISER
     There are a number of examples of diseases that
     have no effect on the carrier, but can still
     infect others. It may be that her healing
     abilities are fighting off the infection in her
     own system without eradicating it completely.

  O'NEILL
     Should...Jonas still be in there?

  FRAISER
     He wants to be. Chances are, he's already been
     exposed, it's possible we all have. If this did
     come from her, we need to know as much as she can
     tell us.

  CARTER
     The C-130 is scheduled to pick us up tomorrow.

  FRAISER
     Better call it off.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, they couldn't have flown in this weather
     anyway.

  FRAISER
     Until I know a lot more about what's going on
     here, we're quarantined.

  ANNOTATION
     Only more static is heard. Carter enters the
     infirmary.

  CARTER
     How is she?

  FRAISER
     Not good. Fever won't come down, she's not
     responding to antibiotics. Whatever this is, it's
     fast.

  CARTER
     Woods and Osbourne still aren't back and they're
     not responding on the radio.

  FRAISER
     If they developed the same symptoms as Michaels,
     they could be weak, disoriented or even passed
     out.

  CARTER
     You definitely think this came from Aiyana?

  FRAISER
     Well, Michaels seems to have been affected first
     and she was the one working with the tissue
     sample.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sits on one of the beds in the room.

     doorway.

  OSBOURNE
     Help!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c come running from the complex ,
     followed by Carter and Fraiser. O'Neill kneels
     down beside Osbourne. Osbourne waves at the case
     he was carrying.

  OSBOURNE
     The core samples.

  O'NEILL
     Where's Woods?

  ANNOTATION
     Osbourne is obviously freezing cold and has
     difficulty breathing. They start removing his
     headgear.

  OSBOURNE
     Got separated...hoping he made his way back here.

  O'NEILL
     What about the snow cat?

  OSBOURNE
     Got stuck in a drift.

  CARTER
     It's minus thirty. He won't last for long out
     there.

  FRAISER
     He's running a high temperature. Help me get him
     back to the barracks.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c help Osbourne to his feet and
     take him through to the infirmary.

  O'NEILL
     (into helmet radio) Roger that.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c drive out. Carter walks over to

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana is looking out of the window as the outer
     door to the complex closes. Jonas enters the lab.
     Ayiana looks at him then looks back out of the
     window.

  JONAS
     Oh. Dr. Woods is lost. Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c
     went out there to find him. Hope they do. Dr.
     Michaels and Dr. Osbourne are both...sick. Dr.
     Fraiser thinks that we may have been, uh, infected
     by some disease that you're carrying.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana moves her head slightly, as though
     understanding Jonas.

  JONAS
     Eventually, we're all gonna be very sick.
     But...you have no idea what I'm talking about,
     so...

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana moves towards Jonas, a questioning look on
     her face. She gestures to herself as though
     questioning her actions.

  JONAS
     Do you? You can understand me?

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana nods her head in the affirmative.

  JONAS
     You're a quicker study than I am. So, is there
     anything at all that you can tell me about this
     disease you're carrying? Why you're not sick? You
     don't know? Y-You don't remember anything?

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana shakes her head.

  JONAS
     Do you know how you're able to heal yourself?

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana shakes her head again. Jonas sighs in
     frustration.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser enters from the infirmary.

  FRAISER
     I'm going to boost the dose of antibiotic, but so
     far I haven't seen any sign of bacterial growth in
     the culture.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser walks to Carter, who is sitting at a
     monitor.

  FRAISER
     If this is a virus, there is nothing else I can do
     here.

  CARTER
     How much time do they have?

  FRAISER
     Days, hours. I don't know. Michaels' kidneys have
     started to shut down and that's a bad sign.

  CARTER
     The ice core sample that Osbourne brought back
     places Ayiana in the same vein as the Stargate.
     She's at least three million years old. But if she
     comes from a race that actually predates the
     glacier and your theory is correct, she could be a
     lot older.

  O'NEILL

     Carter moves to the two-way radio.

  CARTER

  JONAS
     It's unbelievable.

  FRAISER
     What?

  JONAS
     She understands everything I'm saying. Everything.
     I told her exactly what's been happening and she
     seems to...to know that she...she's responsible
     for it somehow, you know? Like it's her fault.

  FRAISER
     She told you that?

  JONAS
     Not in so many words, no.

  FRAISER
     Well, what about something that could help us?

  JONAS
     Not yet, but, uh, it doesn't mean that her memory
     won't come back. It's logical that the...the mind
     would take longer than the body to heal.

  FRAISER
     The problem is, Jonas, we don't know how much time
     we have.

  JONAS
     Right.

     removes his own head gear. Jonas removes Woods'
     boots.

  FRAISER
     Sam, I need you to hook him up onto the monitor.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser cuts through Woods' clothing as Ayiana
     moves around to watch. Jonas pulls off a sock to
     reveal severe frostbite on Woods' foot. He shakes
     his head.

  JONAS
     This can't be good.

     Carter turns back to see what Jonas is talking
     about.

  CARTER
     Oh, my God.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter places EKG leads on Woods' chest as Fraiser
     begins to bag him. Jonas removes the sock from the
     other foot, which is in the same frostbitten
     state. The heart monitor flatlines.

  FRAISER
     He's in V-fib. You get the paddles, I'll get the
     gel.

     Both Jonas and Ayiana are looking on, concerned.

  FRAISER
     Charge to 200.

     up to the gurney.

  O'NEILL

  ANNOTATION
     Aiyana places her right hand on Woods' stomach.
     Jonas walks around towards Ayiana who is grimacing
     and breathing heavily. Suddenly, woods takes a
     deep, gulping breath. Jonas stands next to Ayiana
     as Fraiser and Carter look on, amazed. Carter
     looks to Woods' feet, which seem to glow as the
     signs of frostbite disappear. Fraiser returns the
     paddles to their stand as O'Neill and Teal'c look
     on, stunned. Woods takes another deep breath, then
     Ayiana gasps and collapses. Jonas catches her.
     Fraiser looks at the heart monitor which is now
     showing a normal heartbeat.

  FRAISER
     His vital signs are back to normal.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser checks Woods' pulse as he opens his eyes.
     She looks across at Jonas who is supporting
     Ayiana. Jonas nods, shocked. Carter again checks
     Woods' feet, then looks across at O'Neill in
     disbelief.

  FRAISER
     Hey, are you okay?

  CARTER
     Yeah. What do you think the problem is?

  FRAISER
     Whatever or however she is able to do what she
     does, it weakens her. More each time. I mean,
     she's still carrying that virus herself, Sam. I'm
     afraid there's going to be a point where she puts

     don't know what will happen if we let her try to
     heal all of us.

  CARTER
     She could die.

  FRAISER
     She could save some of us or all of us, who knows.

  MICHAELS
     You know, maybe she just needs some time to get
     her strength back.

  FRAISER
     Well, for the moment, none of us are in dire need,
     so I suggest we get some rest.

  TEAL'C
     I will stand watch.

  FRAISER
     No. Teal'c, if you don't Kel-No-Reem your immune
     system will be vulnerable too.

  WOODS
     We'll watch her.

  OSBOURNE
     Yeah, it's the least we can do.

  MICHAELS
     Yeah, I'll run some tests on the three of us,
     looking for antibody markers. I mean, hopefully,
     whatever she did to us means we're now immune to
     re-infection.

     Osbourne leaves. He passes Teal'c who is sitting
     in a chair, Kel-No-Reeming. He is surrounded by
     lit candles.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Osbourne enters, finding Woods unconscious and no
     sign of Ayiana.

  OSBOURNE
     Norm, wake up...Norm...

  ANNOTATION
     Unable to rouse Woods, he leaves.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--SLEEPING QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Osbourne enters the room and switches on the
     lights. Carter and Fraiser are awake and getting
     dressed.

  OSBOURNE
     She's missing. Woods is unconscious.

  ANNOTATION
     All three hurry out of the room.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--STORAGE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     Osbourne, Fraiser and Carter enter. Osbourne
     points to a door.

  OSBOURNE
     Check there.

  FRAISER
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     As Osbourne goes to another door, Fraiser and
     Carter enter a room, followed by Osbourne.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is bending over an unconscious Ayiana who is
     lying on the floor. Carter checks Ayiana's pulse
     as Fraiser goes to O'Neill who is lying,
     unconscious, on a cot.

  FRAISER
     (to O'Neill) It's okay. It's okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser checks O'Neill's pulse and places her hand
     on his forehead.

  FRAISER
     He's burning up.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--ENTRANCEWAY

  ANNOTATION
     A number of people enter wearing biohazard suits
     and carrying equipment.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--QUARANTINE LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is lying in an enclosed rescue stretcher.
     He has an oxygen mask over his mouth.

  FRAISER
     You're going to be fine, Sir. I'll see you soon.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser is wearing a biohazard suit as she closes
     the lid on the containment stretcher. As O'Neill's
     stretcher is wheeled out, Ayiana appears, also
     lying in a containment stretcher. She too is
     wheeled out.


LOCATION--ANTARCTIC BASE--RESEARCH LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone in the complex is wearing a biohazard
     suit except for Teal'c, who is holding his.

  CARTER
     Teal'c, even though you don't have the disease,
     you could still carry the virus. We'll all get
     properly cleared once we get back to the SGC.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods at Carter.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY QUARANTINE OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is sitting in the room. Hammond enters.

  FRAISER
     (over speakers) Blood pressure's holding 80 over
     40. I wanna do a manual and uh, get me the results
     of his latest bloodwork.

  HAMMOND
     How's he doing?

  CARTER
     They're doing everything they can, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     We talked to the Tok'ra. They said this might be
     beyond their help, but they're sending someone
     anyway.

  CARTER
     His best chance is Ayiana, Sir. She managed to
     halt the virus completely in the rest of us.

  HAMMOND
     Why hasn't she been able to stop it in herself?

  FRAISER
     (over speakers) From what I've been able to learn
     so far, Sir, the virus ultimately acts like
     cerebrospinal meningitis by attacking the brain.
     Despite the physical similarities, Ayiana's brain
     chemistry seems to be quite different from ours. I
     suppose it's possible she's able to trigger an
     immune response in us that she can't muster in
     herself once the disease reaches an end stage.

  HAMMOND
     What are the odds she'll survive?

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser shakes her head slightly, negatively.
     Carter and Hammond look at each other. Carter
     sighs. All three turn to look at O'Neill who is
     lying on a bed.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY QUARANTINE

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana is lying on a bed. A heart monitor beeps in
     the background. Jonas, wearing a biohazard suit
     walks up to her bedside. She is wearing a nasal
     canula. As Jonas approaches, she slowly opens her
     eyes.

  JONAS
     Hey. Glad to see you're awake. I had a feeling
     that you were gonna make it. Thanks for what you
     did for me. You didn't have to do that. Not for
     any of us.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana frowns and grimaces in pain.

  JONAS
     Hey, take it easy, huh? Gotta get your strength
     back. Colonel O'Neill still needs your help. More
     than that, we want you to live. I want you to
     live.

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana weakly shakes her head.

  AYIANA
     Sor-ry.

  ANNOTATION
     As Ayiana loses consciousness, the regular beeping
     turns continuous and Ayiana's heartbeat flatlines.

  JONAS
     Ayiana!

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel dressed in biohazard suits rush into the
     room. Jonas is pushed aside as they begin working
     on Ayiana. Fraiser enters.

  JONAS
     She just, uh...

  FRAISER
     Bag her.

  JONAS
     She just...

  FRAISER
     Give me one milligram epi.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser sets up the defibrillator as Jonas stands
     behind her.

  FRAISER
     Charging to 200.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser grabs the paddles and prepares to "shock"
     Aiyana.

  FRAISER
     Clear! Nothing. Charging to 300. Clear! Come on,
     come on. Again. Clear!

  ANNOTATION
     Ayiana's heartbeat continues to flatline as Jonas
     helplessly looks at Fraiser.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, Thoran, Carter and Teal'c walk up the
     stairs into the room.

  THORAN
     His condition is beyond the healing of a hand
     device. However, there is a symbiote who is in
     dire need of a host.

  CARTER
     What happened?

  THORAN
     The former host was mortally wounded on assignment
     and the symbiote was unable to heal him. We
     believe that would not be the case with Colonel
     O'Neill. Physical trauma is much more difficult to
     deal with than disease.

  TEAL'C
     I do not believe Colonel O'Neill would chose to
     become a Tok'ra.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at Carter who nods in agreement.

  THORAN
     I am aware of the Colonel's dislike for our kind.
     However, I am surprised that you think he would
     choose death over blending.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas enters the room from the stairs, out of
     breath.

  JONAS
     Ayiana's dead. Dr. Fraiser did everything she
     could, but...

  CARTER
     She may have been on borrowed time from the start.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas nods in agreement.

  HAMMOND
     Jonas, this is Thoran of the Tok'ra. Thoran, this
     is Jonas Quinn. The Tok'ra are offering a symbiote
     in hopes that it can heal Colonel O'Neill.

  JONAS
     What does Colonel O'Neill have to say?

  HAMMOND
     Colonel O'Neill's in a coma. The fact is we may be
     in the position of having to decide for him.

  CARTER
     How can we do that?

  THORAN
     No Tok'ra symbiote would choose to blend with an
     unwilling host permanently. Perhaps a temporary
     arrangement can be reached.

  HAMMOND
     What do you mean?

  THORAN
     The symbiote, Kanan, is someone I know well. I
     have no doubt that he would be willing to blend
     with O'Neill, cure him, and then leave him again
     if another suitable host can be found.

  TEAL'C
     If not?

  THORAN
     I assure you he would ultimately sacrifice himself
     rather than remain with an unwilling host. Kanan's
     former host died before he was able to reveal the
     details of what we believe was vital intelligence
     about the undercover mission he was on. I cannot
     stress enough how important that information could
     be.

  CARTER
     Sir, I think it's obvious we all want to do
     anything we can to help Colonel O'Neill, but I
     really think this is something we at least have to
     give him the opportunity to decide for himself.


LOCATION--SGC--INFIRMARY QUARANTINE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter enters, wearing a biohazard suit and joins
     Fraiser at O'Neill's bedside.

  FRAISER
     I'm administering 0.1 epi. I don't know if this is
     gonna work.

  CARTER
     Will it hurt him?

  FRAISER
     Can't get much worse.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser moves away and Carter leans in closer to
     O'Neill.

  CARTER
     Sir, I don't know if you can hear me. The Tok'ra
     have offered you a deal. There's a symbiote that
     needs a host.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and Jonas are standing in the observation
     room, looking down. Fraiser moves to stand at the
     foot of the bed.

  CARTER
     They think it could cure you. Now, it may be your
     only chance. It would only be temporary. It would
     come out of you as soon as they found another
     host.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is lying on the bed, sheened with
     perspiration. He seems to be unconscious and is
     wearing an oxygen mask.

  CARTER
     Sir, are you getting any of this?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves away slightly and looks at Fraiser.
     Jonas and Hammond look down, concerned.

  O'NEILL
     (weakly) Carter?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leans down over the bed again.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I'm right here.

  O'NEILL
     (whispers) Over my dead body.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter closes her eyes and slightly shakes her
     head.

  CARTER
     Sir, the symbiote's host died while they were on a
     mission. The Tok'ra have strong reason to believe
     that the symbiote has vital information to reveal
     and this would give him that chance. Now, they
     promised that if no other host was found within a
     reasonable amount of time, the symbiote would
     sacrifice itself rather than stay in an unwilling
     host. Sir, please.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill flicks a look at Carter, frowns and seems
     to nod his head infinitesimally, then closes his
     eyes. Carter smiles and nods at Fraiser. They both
     turn to look up at the observation room.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is back in the containment stretcher.
     Carter, Thoran, Teal'c, Jonas, and two medics are
     carrying the stretcher. They walk through the
     Stargate.
