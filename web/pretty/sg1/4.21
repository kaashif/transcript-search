     There is a pyramid in the background. In front of
     the Stargate is a line of large stones. The

     Teal'c step through. They spread out silently,
     armed and expecting an ambush.

     O'Neill! Footprints and they are recent.

  O'NEILL
     How many?

  TEAL'C
     Several. Some are that of Jaffa.

     O'Neill is attacked from behind with a zat.

  CARTER
     Take cover!

  ANNOTATION

     by armed Juna people.

     Drop your weapons and surrender!

     They don't look like Jaffa.

     A Jaffa approaches from behind the Stargate.
     Darien is behind him.

     He does.

     There is no escape. Stand and identify yourselves.

     They need not. I know who they are.
