<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Planetary sunrise as seen from space. Pan to the right and see a yellow star, similar to Earth's sun. As pan to the right continues, we see that this star system is a binary, with the yellow star orbiting a white dwarf companion. Around the white dwarf flows a continual stream of matter leeched from the yellow star. A few minutes later, the white dwarf collapses and becomes a black hole, which begins to pull space debris and other matter into its gravity well. Its orbit takes it extremely close to P3W-451. Fade from space view of P3W-451 to its surface.</td></tr>

As the camera pans up from this single person, we see that he's accompanied by two men and a woman -- a Stargate team. The figure in the lead looks back over his shoulder at his companions. We can see the patches of the SGC/Earth symbol on their shoulders. All the voices are distorted because of their closeness to the black hole.</td></tr>
