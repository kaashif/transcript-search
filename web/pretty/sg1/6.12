LOCATION--SHOT OF THE X-303 AND THOR'S SHIP IN SPACE


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  O'NEILL
     Are you serious?

  THOR
     Very.

  O'NEILL
     This ship you need, this brand new ship...

  THOR
     Yes.

  O'NEILL
     So new it doesn't have a name yet. It's not even
     finished.

  CARTER
     I think that's the point, sir. The more low-tech,
     the better.

  THOR
     Correct, Major Carter.

  JONAS
     It certainly defies conventional wisdom.

  O'NEILL
     Mine, too.

  THOR
     The Replicators will not wish to integrate such
     vastly inferior technology into their own.

  O'NEILL
     Then... what?

  THOR
     A task for which you are uniquely suited.

  O'NEILL
     You need someone dumb enough.

  THOR
     On the contrary, it is both your physical prowess
     and military expertise that are required.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, don't get me wrong, flattery goes a long way
     with me. But, if you're going where I think you're
     going with this...

  THOR
     When it became clear to the Asgard High Council
     that the war with the Replicators could not be
     won, a plan was devised, a trap was set. One made
     possible by you.

  CARTER
     By us?

  THOR
     The android Reese that you discovered and provided
     to us for study retained a single core command in
     her base programming which we believed all
     Replicators would still follow.

  CARTER
     Then, you were able to reactivate her?

  THOR
     No. The android was damaged beyond repair.
     However, the key command was activated within her
     neural network, amplified, and broadcast through
     subspace throughout the known universe.

  CARTER
     What was the command?

  THOR
     To come forth.

  JONAS
     You instructed every Replicator out there to come
     to you?

  O'NEILL
     I have a theory why you lost the war.

  THOR
     The command was only given once the trap was set.

  JONAS
     What was the trap?

  THOR
     A time dilation device generating a field radius
     of point one six light years.

  CARTER
     Wow, that's some trap.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at her.

  CARTER
     They created a bubble in space around the
     Replicators within which time was slowed down by a
     factor of...?

  THOR
     Ten to the fourth power.

  CARTER
     Relatively speaking, sir, one year to the
     Replicators would be about ten thousand years to
     the rest of us. An hour would be over a year, a
     day would...

  O'NEILL
     I get it.

  CARTER
     The point is, if the plan had worked, it would
     have effectively bottled the Replicators up in one
     place, and bought the Asgard thousands of years to
     solve the problem.

  O'NEILL
     No, the point is, it didn't work.

  THOR
     O'Neill is correct. Our plan failed.

  JONAS
     What went wrong?

  THOR
     We do not know. The time dilation device was
     constructed within a very old structure on Hala,
     the first planet settled by the Asgard. The device
     was encased in a solid neutronium shell, and set
     with a time delay sufficient to evacuate our
     entire civilization.

  JONAS
     Well, however strong neutronium is, wouldn't the
     Replicators be able to eat through it?

  THOR
     Eventually, yes. But not in sufficient time before
     the device activated. This calculation was made
     with considerable margin for error. When the time
     came, nothing happened.

  CARTER
     So, somehow the Replicators must have gotten to
     the time dilation device before it could activate.

  THOR
     That appears to be the only explanation.

  O'NEILL
     So, what do you want us to do?

  THOR
     Fly your ship through Replicator-dominated space,
     repair whatever damage may have been done to the
     time dilation device, and activate it before the
     Replicators can stop you.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Thor in disbelief.

LOCATION--X-303 COMMAND DECK

  O'NEILL
     Thor, buddy, there's no way.

  THOR
     The Replicators will soon consume all that they
     can within our home galaxy. Yours will be next.

  O'NEILL
     I thought we were too primitive to consume.

  THOR
     Your technology would not immediately attract the
     Replicators, but they would eventually be drawn to
     the raw materials of which your civilization is
     built. Your extinction will be assured.

  CARTER
     For that matter, so would every other world we've
     visited. It's just a matter of time.

  JONAS
     Did all of the Asgard manage to escape?

  THOR
     Most, but not all. A great battle was fought. The
     evacuation fleet is standing by in the void
     between our two galaxies, waiting to hear word of
     your response.

  O'NEILL
     My response?

  THOR
     We have done all that we can and failed, O'Neill.
     You and your team represent our last hope.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, great, so, no pressure, right?

  ANNOTATION
     He stands up and approaches Thor.

  THOR
     If you have in fact made your decision not to
     undertake this task, I will inform the Council.

  O'NEILL
     Just... give me a minute here, okay?

  TEAL'C
     Are you reconsidering, O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     I'm considering reconsidering.

  JONAS
     Well, there has to be other options.

  THOR
     We believe there is no alternative plan of action.

  CARTER
     Thor, I don't think you realize what you're asking
     us to do.

  THOR
     In the past, your projectile weapons have been
     most effective.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, well, we don't have any projectile weapons
     with us at the moment, and according to Carter,
     we're a long way from...

  ANNOTATION
     Thor moves a control device on the board attached
     to his chair, and Earth suddenly appears on the
     viewscreen.

  O'NEILL
     ...home.

  CARTER
     You towed us back into Earth's orbit.

  THOR
     Correct, Major Carter. The contents of your armory
     at Stargate Command, along with appropriate
     attire, food, and other supplies you may require
     are now being transported aboard this vessel.

  O'NEILL
     I hope you did the paperwork.

  CARTER
     Wait a minute, we have a few passengers.

  THOR
     They are being transported to Stargate Command.

  O'NEILL
     I haven't said yes, yet.

  THOR
     But you are reconsidering.

  O'NEILL
     I'm... leaning in the general direction.

  ANNOTATION
     Thor moves another control device, and Earth
     suddenly disappears from the screen.

  O'NEILL
     Hey, what are you doing?

  CARTER
     We're leaving the solar system.

  O'NEILL
     Thor, little fella, I... that's not the way it
     works. It's not my ship. It's not up to me.

  THOR
     The journey to our home galaxy will take many
     hours with your vessel in tow. You may consult
     your superiors en route.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Alarm klaxons are sounding as Hammond enters.

  HAMMOND
     Sergeant?

  SILER
     I can't explain it, sir. It's like everything in
     the armory just disappeared - P90s, SPAS 12s,
     SAWs, Claymores, everything.

  SGT. DAVIS
     Sir, four of the people who commandeered the X-303
     just appeared out of thin air in the holding room.
     Air Force personnel, a reporter, just beamed into
     the cafeteria kitchen up on level twenty-two. Half
     the food stores went missing at the same time.

  HAMMOND
     You're certain the stargate's been inactive?

  SGT. DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

  HAMMOND
     What in God's name is happening?

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram of O'Neill suddenly appears.

  O'NEILL
     Hello, sir, Siler.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel, it's good to see you alive and well. We
     were concerned the X-303 was lost with all hands.

  O'NEILL
     No, sir, we're all fine. Except for the Goa'uld,
     and Simmons, of course.

  HAMMOND
     So, you were rescued by the Asgard.

  O'NEILL
     Actually, it kinda looks like we'll be coming to
     their rescue, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Does this have anything to do with the supplies
     and equipment that are disappearing from all over
     my base?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir. Suffice to say you might want to get
     upstairs and punch one on the old speed dial.

  HAMMOND
     My grandchildren?

  O'NEILL
     Two, then. I think the president might want to
     know what the Asgard have in mind for our new
     ship.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working at a console as O'Neill enters.

  O'NEILL
     They didn't go for it.

  CARTER
     They didn't approve the mission?

  O'NEILL
     No, they did that, once they knew the stakes and
     the whole "fate of the universe" stuff. Both the
     president and Hammond realized we have no choice.
     He sends good luck, godspeed, and all those things
     he says when he thinks we're going to die.

  CARTER
     So, what didn't they go for?

  O'NEILL
     The name I suggested.

  CARTER
     For the ship.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  CARTER
     Yeah. Sir, we can't call it the Enterprise.

  O'NEILL
     Why not?

  CARTER
     The code name for the project is Prometheus.
     What's wrong with that?

  O'NEILL
     It's a Greek tragedy. Who wants that?

  CARTER
     Okay. The X-303 it is, then.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at the device she's been working on.

  O'NEILL
     What have you got there?

  CARTER
     Well, the Asgard surmised that the Replicators
     probably disabled the time dilation device by
     destroying the control interface mechanism.

  O'NEILL
     Uh-huh.

  CARTER
     Well, it's really not much more than an advanced
     timer. But, since any Asgard technology we took
     along would cause the Replicators to swarm all
     over us, Thor had a facsimile of their interface
     built from Earth-based materials. It'll work just
     as well as the original, but it shouldn't attract
     the Replicators.

  O'NEILL
     I'm hungry.

  CARTER
     Cargo bay three, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves, and Carter goes back to work.


LOCATION--CARGO BAY THREE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill opens the door to find Teal'c and Jonas
     eating ice cream.

  O'NEILL
     You guys trying to make yourselves sick?

  JONAS
     Well, Thor forgot to take the need for
     refrigeration into account, so we figured we'd
     start with the frozen stuff.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes another spoonful.

  JONAS
     This is good. Mmmm.

  O'NEILL
     I'll buy that.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits down on a crate.

  O'NEILL
     So, Jonas, first time going up against a
     Replicator, eh?

  JONAS
     Um-hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill tries to eat some of Teal'c's ice cream.
     Teal'c pulls his carton out of reach, giving
     O'Neill a different one instead.

  JONAS
     I think I have a pretty good idea of what to
     expect, though. Teal'c told me all about them and
     I have everything Dr. Jackson wrote. They're
     fascinating.

  O'NEILL
     Fascinating?

  JONAS
     Yeah. Well, think about it. We have a human
     scientist who creates this android girl, who then
     goes on to create these Replicators as a toy.
     Well, at least the concept of something that
     starts out so innocent becomes so evil, that's got
     to be fascinating to you.

  TEAL'C
     Replicators exist merely to increase their numbers
     and do so without prejudice. They are no more evil
     that a virus.

  O'NEILL
     A really evil virus.

  JONAS
     Well, yes, we can all agree that any living thing
     that isn't inherently evil in and of itself is
     capable of undertaking actions that are evil.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c swaps his ice cream for O'Neill's.

  TEAL'C
     We are slowing.

  CARTER
     (over the radio) Colonel, you should come forward,
     sir.

  O'NEILL
     We're on our way.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c, and Jonas enter.

  CARTER
     We just came out of hyperspace a minute ago.

  THOR
     We dare proceed no further without risk of
     engaging the Replicators. You will have to
     continue from this point under your own ship's
     power.

  O'NEILL
     But you're gonna wait here for us, right?

  THOR
     There is now another concern. Our long-range
     sensors have discovered that the time dilation
     device was indeed activated.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that's good. (pause) It's not good?

  THOR
     Time is now progressing faster within the field.

  CARTER
     They reversed it?

  THOR
     By a factor of ten squared.

  O'NEILL
     What is with you people? Time machines are nothing
     but trouble, even we know that.

  TEAL'C
     Clearly, the Replicators have discovered a means
     of utilizing the time dilation machine to serve
     their own purpose.

  JONAS
     Well, what would that purpose be?

  O'NEILL
     Well, I gotta tell you, this changes things.
     (pause) Carter, how does this change things?

  CARTER
     I don't know, sir. I guess it doesn't.

  O'NEILL
     You mean we've got the same problem we had an hour
     ago.

  CARTER
     Well, the difference is, in that hour, four days
     have passed for the Replicators. Depending on when
     they did this, relatively speaking, they could
     have experienced hundreds of years.

  O'NEILL
     I get it.

  THOR
     If you wish to reconsider...

  O'NEILL
     No, no. Full well expected the other shoe to drop
     eventually.

  THOR
     We can only hope that this will be the last
     footwear to fall. The coordinates to the planet
     have already been programmed into your
     navigational computer. We have modified your
     engines and structural integrity fields to their
     maximum potential to assure your safe arrival. We
     will monitor your progress as best we can. Good
     Luck.

  ANNOTATION
     Thor disappears. Everyone sits down.

  CARTER
     Setting course to programmed coordinates.
     Throttling up sub-light engines.

LOCATION--X-303 ARMORY

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is loading a P-90.

  O'NEILL
     Again.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas takes out the cartridge and re-loads it.

  JONAS
     My hands are covered in blisters. They're not
     gonna work any faster.

  CARTER
     (over the radio) Colonel, we're about to pass
     through into the time dilation field.

  O'NEILL
     We're on our way.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas puts the weapon down. He and O'Neill leave.


LOCATION--SHOT OF X-303 APPROACHING A PLANET


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  TEAL'C
     A replicator-controlled vessel approaches.

  CARTER
     Hopefully, they'll agree with Thor and think this
     ship is a piece of junk.

  TEAL'C
     They are scanning us.

  ANNOTATION
     A bright white light shines over them.


LOCATION--CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Jonas see the light as well.

  CARTER
     (over the radio) Sir, we're being scanned by the
     Replicator ship. Stand by.

  ANNOTATION
     The light is gone.

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter, on the radio) We still in business?


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  CARTER
     (to O'Neill, on the radio) Yes, sir, it's moving
     off. Looks like we're clear to enter the planet's
     atmosphere.


LOCATION--SHOT OF THE X-303 MOVING TOWARD THE PLANET


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Jonas enter and take seats.

  CARTER
     We're detecting one structure at the designated
     coordinates.

  O'NEILL
     Just the one?

  TEAL'C
     There appears to be little topography of any kind.

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen shows them approaching the surface.


LOCATION--SHOT OF THE X-303 APPROACHING THE SURFACE

  ANNOTATION
     The sky is cloud-covered, and there are bright
     flashes of lightning. One structure is faintly
     visible in the distance.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  JONAS
     Two hundred meters.

  CARTER
     Throttling down to fifty percent.

  JONAS
     One five zero meters.

  CARTER
     The surface appears to be completely smooth.

  JONAS
     One hundred meters.

  TEAL'C
     No sign of Replicators.

  CARTER
     Deceleration thrusters are firing.

  JONAS
     Five zero meters.

  CARTER
     The inertial compensators and structural integrity
     are at maximum. Landing struts are at full
     extension.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a bright flash.

  O'NEILL
     What was that?

  CARTER
     Lightning, sir. All systems are still go.

  JONAS
     Ten meters.

  ANNOTATION
     Lightning hits the ship and something
     malfunctions, pouring steam onto the bridge.
     Teal'c goes to fix the problem.

  JONAS
     Five meters.

  JONAS
     Touchdown!

  CARTER
     Shutting down thrusters.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone relaxes a little, and O'Neill goes to
     look out the window.

  O'NEILL
     Get a message to Thor. Let him know we touched
     down. Let's move out.


LOCATION--SHOT OF THE PLANET SURFACE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 leaves the ship and heads for the structure,
     which looks like a giant "X".

  JONAS
     This can't be the only structure on the entire
     planet.

  O'NEILL
     I'd be willing to bet the bugs ate everything
     else.

  JONAS
     Then where are they?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stops to sweep away some dirt on the
     ground.

  CARTER
     Sir? You're not gonna like this.

  JONAS
     What is it?

  TEAL'C
     This planet's surface appears to be covered by
     Replicator blocks.

  CARTER
     Probably more than one layer, and who knows how
     thick it is. Maybe miles.

  JONAS
     Why would that be?

  CARTER
     Well, it could be a by-product of the reverse time
     dilation. In relative time, they've been here
     hundreds of years, but there's nothing left here
     to consume so they're just conserving energy.

  JONAS
     What's keeping them here?

  O'NEILL
     Who cares? Watch your step.

  ANNOTATION
     They continue walking toward the structure.


LOCATION--THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     Inside is dimly-lit. SG-1 shine their flashlights
     as they go down some steps and into a large room.
     Carter goes to the time dilation device.

  CARTER
     Sir, the original interface is still intact. I
     might be able to...

  ANNOTATION
     They hear footsteps, and a young man appears.

  FIFTH
     Who are you?

  O'NEILL
     Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force, Earth. Who are
     you?

  FIFTH
     The others are coming.

  ANNOTATION
     Four others appear, two men and two women. One man
     steps forward, and O'Neill raises his weapon.

  FIRST
     What do you think you're doing?

  O'NEILL
     Clocks are running a little fast around here.
     Thought we'd stop by, wind `em. We'll be on our
     way.

  FIRST
     Your companion is attempting to alter the settings
     on the time device, and we cannot allow that. If
     she does not stop immediately, we will be forced
     to take action.

  O'NEILL
     Well, now, if you do that, we might be forced to
     take our own action.

  FIRST
     Tell your companion to stop.

  O'NEILL
     Carter, how much time you need there?

  CARTER
     A lot, sir. Maybe a few hours.

  O'NEILL
     Hours?

  CARTER
     Sir, the interface was completely rebuilt. I'm not
     even sure where to start.

  O'NEILL
     Couldn't you crank it up a little bit? Move things
     along?

  CARTER
     It doesn't work that way, sir.

  FIRST
     (laughs) Ironic, isn't it?

  O'NEILL
     Who are you people? Because, if you haven't
     noticed, this entire planet is paved with
     Replicators.

  FIRST
     We are aware of this.

  O'NEILL
     Then you should also know that these things have
     taken millions of lives, and they'll keep on doing
     that unless we stop them.

  SECOND
     He doesn't understand.

  O'NEILL
     You know, he's standing right here.

  FIRST
     We cannot allow you to stop them, I'm afraid.

  O'NEILL
     Why not?

  FIRST
     We are Replicators.

  O'NEILL
     Ah.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens fire, as do Teal'c and Jonas. The bullets
     take chunks out of the wall, but leave the people
     undamaged. They stop firing, and dozens of
     Replicator bugs appear.

  FIRST
     Tell your companion to step away from the device.

  O'NEILL
     Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     She moves away.

  FIRST
     Your projectile weapons?

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, you know, I think we'll hang onto those for
     a while.

  ANNOTATION
     The replicator bugs retreat.

  FIRST
     Now there is no need.

  ANNOTATION
     Slowly, the members of SG-1 remove their weapons
     and put them on the ground.

  FIRST
     Where are my manners? This is something of an
     occasion, after all, isn't it? Our first meeting.
     Welcome.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out his hand to O'Neill, who ignores it.

  FIRST
     Colonel, if we really intended you harm, do you
     believe you would be standing there? As I said,
     welcome.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill steps forward to shake hands, but sinks to
     his knees under the vise-like grip. First holds
     out his other hand, and the fingers disappear into
     O'Neill's forehead. O'Neill screams in pain.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S MIND

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and First are in the gate room, which is
     lit only by a deep blue light.

  FIRST
     We are inside your unconscious mind now.

  O'NEILL
     You'd think there'd be more lights on.

  FIRST
     This place must be important to you.

  O'NEILL
     I work here.

  FIRST
     Your iris code is 906124637.

  O'NEILL
     Wow, that's... close. Here's one for you: I'm
     thinking of an animal...

  FIRST
     (laughs) I never expected that you would amuse me.

  O'NEILL
     I never expected you to put your hand in my head.

  FIRST
     Your mind is incredible.

  O'NEILL
     Well...

  FIRST
     Such chaos and humor and pain.

  ANNOTATION
     Flashback to the memory of when Charlie shot
     himself from "Cold Lazarus", Season 1.

  FIRST
     You're correct to blame yourself. Your son would
     be alive but for your carelessness.

  O'NEILL
     Don't do that again.

  FIRST
     That will be your punishment each time you attempt
     to conceal something from me on our journey.

  ANNOTATION
     An event horizon appears without the gate being
     dialed.

  O'NEILL
     Where are we going?

  FIRST
     Every place you have ever been.

  ANNOTATION
     They step through the gate.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c wakes up. He looks around, realizes where
     he is, and switches the lights on. Carter and
     O'Neill are in their chairs. He shakes O'Neill,
     who wakes up and holds his hands to his face.

  O'NEILL
     Crap! Holy sh...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill reaches over and shakes Carter, waking
     her.

  O'NEILL
     Carter! Jonas!

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas finds himself sitting on the floor, and
     stands, moaning in remembered pain.

  JONAS
     Her hand was inside my head. It was like a... it
     was like a nightmare.

  CARTER
     I think we all had a similar experience. I don't
     remember much of it.

  TEAL'C
     Nor do I.

  O'NEILL
     How long were we out?

  CARTER
     Thirty-seven hours, sir. Ship time.

  JONAS
     Why would they bring us back here?

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps we can take advantage of the situation.

  CARTER
     Detonate the hyperdrive, you mean. An overload
     would cause a pretty big explosion.

  O'NEILL
     Big enough to be worth it?

  CARTER
     I honestly don't know, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Go.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leaves.

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) Get a message to Thor. Let him know
     how massively he screwed up.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets up and leaves the bridge, Jonas
     following.

  JONAS
     Hey, Colonel. Colonel, I don't think this is going
     to work.

  O'NEILL
     If Carter says she can do it...

  JONAS
     Yeah, but if explosives and weapons worked, the
     Asgard would have won their war.

  O'NEILL
     I suppose you want to talk to these bug people.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter an elevator.

  JONAS
     Don't you?

  O'NEILL
     No.

  JONAS
     Maybe we can reason with them. If we blow this
     ship, then we lose that option altogether.

  O'NEILL
     If we blow the ship, I won't care.

  ANNOTATION
     They exit the elevator and head down a corridor.

  JONAS
     Colonel, I don't think that you fully appreciate
     what they've become.

  O'NEILL
     Replicators who look like we do.

  JONAS
     More than that. Sir, this is a huge leap in their
     evolution.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas! They are Replicators.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter a room and find Carter and Fifth
     inside.

  O'NEILL
     Carter? What's going on?

  CARTER
     Everything's fine, sir. We were just chatting.

  O'NEILL
     About what?

  CARTER
     He carried us back here, sir. One at a time. So
     we'd be more comfortable.

  JONAS
     Thanks.

  FIFTH
     It was not difficult.

  CARTER
     Apparently sir, we're invited to dinner.

  FIFTH
     At his request.

  O'NEILL
     Whose?

  FIFTH
     First.

  O'NEILL
     And you are?

  FIFTH
     I was Fifth. The others are merging with our
     Replicator brethren, but they will return soon.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, you wanna let him know we've made other
     plans?

  FIFTH
     Exploding your vessel would only serve to feed
     energy to the Replicator blocks on the surface of
     the planet. Your food stores have already been
     taken to the temple.

  JONAS
     When are we expected?

  FIFTH
     (grins widely) When you become hungry.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  JONAS
     That one's different.

  CARTER
     No kidding. I mean, he comes across as almost
     human.

  O'NEILL
     Well, he's not.

  CARTER
     So, what do we do?

  JONAS
     Can we leave?

  CARTER
     The ship will fly, but I don't know how far we'll
     get. Sir, if this really is the next evolution of
     the Replicators, we should find out as much as
     possible about them and try to report it back
     somehow.

  O'NEILL
     Anyone hungry?


LOCATION--SHOT OF SG-1 APPROACHING THE STRUCTURE


LOCATION--INSIDE THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 comes down the steps to find a long table set
     with food. The human Replicators are seated along
     one side, with First at the opposite end. He
     rises.

  FIRST
     Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, Teal'c, Jonas.
     Welcome.

  O'NEILL
     You'll forgive us if we don't shake your hands
     this time.

  FIRST
     Please sit and replenish yourselves. Organic forms
     store energy so inefficiently.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at a new woman sitting nearest them.

  O'NEILL
     I assume you're Sixth.

  SIXTH
     Yes.

  FIRST
     Our newest addition.

  O'NEILL
     You're kinda going girl, boy, girl, boy.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter realizes the table is made of Replicator
     blocks.

  CARTER
     Sir, the entire table...

  O'NEILL
     I see that.

  ANNOTATION
     They all sit down, including First.

  JONAS
     We still have some questions that we never got a
     chance to ask last time we met.

  FIRST
     When our Replicator brethren discovered the
     android Reese, they realized she was their
     creator. They studied her design and form and
     found aspects of her technology superior to their
     own.

  SECOND
     Our brethren are composed of ungainly blocks.

  THIRD
     We are composed of millions of cell units,
     microscopic in comparison, that combine to create
     this form.

  CARTER
     Like nanites, sir.

  O'NEILL
     I hate those things.

  FIRST
     My creation took place in the last moment before
     the Asgard time device was to activate. There was
     a miniscule crack in the neutronium shell. I could
     penetrate this where my Replicator brethren could
     not. I managed to stop the machine before it
     activated and eventually used it to suit our
     purpose.

  JONAS
     Which is?

  FIRST
     To increase our number. That has never changed.
     And now, thanks to the Asgard, we have all the
     time in the world. In a few short years, we will
     go forth as an army.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, see, we can't you do that.

  SECOND
     You cannot stop us.

  FIRST
     Was it not in the same way that you became the
     dominant species of your world? Is it not a
     process of natural selection? The strong survive.

  JONAS
     Yeah, but there's nothing truly natural about you.
     I mean, you've seen into our minds, I'm quite
     certain that you can all tell the difference.

  FIRST
     Of course. We are far superior. And if you could
     see into the mind of an animal you would blindly
     feed upon, you would reach the same conclusion.

  CARTER
     It was our kind that built your creator. You
     created yourselves in our image.

  FOURTH
     No. In the image of Reese.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, now see, there was something wrong with her
     programming, you all know that.

  FIRST
     The flaw in the emulation programming was
     discovered during my creation. Eat.

  O'NEILL
     You know, I think that flaw's kinda hanging on
     there.

  FIRST
     We attempted to correct the error in the creation
     of Fifth. But thus far, he has proven to be far
     too...

  JONAS
     Human?

  FIRST
     Weak.

  CARTER
     Maybe Fifth represents what you're supposed to be.

  FIRST
     No. We won't make the same mistake again. Now, you
     have your answers, eat.

  JONAS
     Why?

  FIRST
     To regain your strength.

  O'NEILL
     Why do you care?

  FIFTH
     So you'll be strong enough.

  JONAS
     For what?

  FIFTH
     To go into your minds over and over.

  FIRST
     Could there be any other reason we would keep you
     alive?

  ANNOTATION
     A Replicator bug drops down onto the table, and
     others start climbing down the walls.

  O'NEILL
     Crap!

  FIRST
     It will be far less painful if you don't resist.

  ANNOTATION
     Fifth stands up.

  FIFTH
     Stop.

  ANNOTATION
     The Replicators move away.

  FIRST
     Why?

  FIFTH
     You've learned everything you need to know.

  ANNOTATION
     First stands, and approaches Fifth.

  FIRST
     There are four minds to explore at least once. And
     Sixth is very curious to experience their
     thoughts. And you, you haven't yet had your
     chance.

  FIFTH
     No.

  FIRST
     I insist. I want you to see the disorder, the
     chaos, recognize what they are in comparison. You
     need to understand what you are. Visit their
     memories of worlds we will conquer. Do you
     understand?

  FIFTH
     Yes.

  CARTER
     I won't blame you if you choose me.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     It's all right, sir. Last time I didn't remember a
     thing. [She gets up and walks over to Fifth. He
     places his hands on the sides of her face, and
     leans forward until his forehead touches hers.].


LOCATION--FIFTH'S UNCONSCIOUS MIND

  ANNOTATION
     Fifth and Carter are standing in a desolate
     landscape, with heavy cloud cover and lightning
     flashes like the planet.

  CARTER
     I don't know what you're showing me, but it's not
     my unconscious mind.

  FIFTH
     No, Major Carter. It is mine. We share much of our
     thought, in this way we are connected even with
     our Replicator brethren. But this corner of my
     mind is mine alone. It is the only place we could
     communicate without the others knowing what is
     said.

  CARTER
     You're not like them.

  FIFTH
     I'm a mistake.

  CARTER
     No, they are. A terrible mistake. Help us.

  FIFTH
     I can't.

  CARTER
     You can. Because you're more like us than you're
     like them. The others inherited the same flaw that
     Reese had. But you...

  FIFTH
     The others would destroy me.

  CARTER
     Not if you came with us.

  FIFTH
     You would do that?

  CARTER
     If you were to come with us, and the time dilation
     device was reset with the new interface we brought
     with us...

  FIFTH
     They are my brothers and sisters.

  CARTER
     The Asgard device was never designed to destroy
     the Replicators. For them, it would seem like a
     few days had passed. We'd have hundreds of years
     to solve their flaw.

  FIFTH
     What do you want me to do?


LOCATION--THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter wakes up to find herself lying on the
     floor. She gets up and goes to O'Neill, who is
     also on the floor.

  CARTER
     Sir? Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, that's just not right.

  ANNOTATION
     He notices Carter.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas and Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone stands up, including O'Neill.

  CARTER
     Sir, there's a way out of this but we're gonna
     have to trust...

  TEAL'C
     Major Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     Fifth is working on the time dilation device. He
     turns and faces them.

  FIFTH
     I have made the necessary adjustments.

  JONAS
     To what?

  FIFTH
     The time dilation device. I'm coming with you.

  O'NEILL
     I assume this was what you were gonna tell me?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  FIFTH
     The others are merging with our brethren, sharing
     what they have learned from you, but they will
     return soon. I have reconfigured the device, but
     you must enter your command code.

  O'NEILL
     Go.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter goes to the device.

  O'NEILL
     You guys head back to the ship. Don't fire up the
     engines, but be ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Jonas leave.

  CARTER
     My code is in, sir, I just need to set the timer.
     It'll take at least two minutes at a dead run for
     us to get to the ship, and two more for the
     engines to fire up.

  FIFTH
     That is far too long. If I leave, the others will
     know. They will return before the device
     activates.

  O'NEILL
     Then we set it off now.

  FIFTH
     No. We will be trapped with the others.

  CARTER
     You can probably make it to the ship at lot faster
     than we can, right?

  FIFTH
     Oh yes, in a fraction of the time.

  CARTER
     Give us a head start. If you arrive at the ship
     just before we launch, your absence won't alert
     the others until it's too late for them to do
     anything about it.

  O'NEILL
     So, set the timer for five minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     He signals privately for Carter to make it three
     minutes.

  CARTER
     That's cutting it awfully close, sir.

  O'NEILL
     I know that, Major.

  CARTER
     (to Fifth) Thank you.

  FIFTH
     You won't leave without me?

  CARTER
     No. Head for the ship in a little over three
     minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     She enters the time on the device.

  CARTER
     Three, two, one, mark. Timer's running.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and O'Neill leave.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas and Teal'c enter, and begin switching things
     on.


LOCATION--THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     Fifth is waiting.


LOCATION--PLANET SURFACE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter run towards the X-303.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  O'NEILL
     (over the radio) Fire up those engines, now!

  TEAL'C
     Understood, O'Neill.


LOCATION--THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     Fifth turns to leave, and runs into First.

  FIRST
     What have you done?

  FIFTH
     Nothing.

  FIRST
     Where are the humans?

  FIFTH
     They've returned to their ship to rest.

  FIRST
     They're trying to escape.

  FIFTH
     No.

  FIRST
     Even as we speak, they're preparing to leave.

  FIFTH
     But, she promised.

  FIRST
     It's not too late. I can read your mind. There's
     time enough to stop the machine.

  FIFTH
     No.


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter enter and take their seats.

  O'NEILL
     How long?

  CARTER
     Twenty seconds before the device activates.

  O'NEILL
     Get this thing in the air or we're gonna be here a
     long time.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c hits a button and they lift off.


LOCATION--THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     Replicator bugs screech as they enter the room
     where First and Fifth are arguing.

  FIRST
     They're escaping.

  FIFTH
     There's still two minutes left.

  FIRST
     No, my son. They made a fool of you.

  FIFTH
     They won't leave me. She promised.

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches for the timer and flips it up. There
     are only three seconds left.

  FIFTH
     (quietly) She promised.

  ANNOTATION
     The device activates, and everything appears to
     freeze as time slows down.


LOCATION--SCENE OF THE X-303 LEAVING THE PLANET


LOCATION--X-303 BRIDGE

  TEAL'C
     We are beyond the time dilation field.

  CARTER
     Thor sends his congratulations, sir. They'll
     rendezvous with us as soon as they've determined
     no Replicator vessels escaped.

  O'NEILL
     Fine.

  JONAS
     You do realize what you did?

  O'NEILL
     The right thing, Jonas.

  JONAS
     You used his humanity against him.

  O'NEILL
     His what?

  CARTER
     Jonas is right. It's exactly what we did.

  O'NEILL
     He wasn't human. Get that through your heads.

  CARTER
     You could have fooled me.

  O'NEILL
     We all know what would have happened if those
     things had gotten out. Who's gonna stop them? We
     did the right thing.

  JONAS
     I hope you're right, sir.

  CARTER
     So do I.


LOCATION--THE STRUCTURE

  ANNOTATION
     We close on Fifth's frozen face and the rest of
     the frozen replicators.
