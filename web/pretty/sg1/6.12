<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>JONAS: Well, however strong neutronium is, wouldn't the Replicators be able to eat through it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>THOR: Eventually, yes. But not in sufficient time before the device activated. This calculation was made with considerable margin for error. When the time came, nothing happened.</td></tr>
