But now, after what you've told me of these Ori and the Priors, I fear that may have been a better way to go.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>DANIEL: All Tagaluns, both Rand and Caledonian alike, deserve to know the truth. If we tell them what we know, who the Ori really are, they might be convinced to dismantle this weapon themselves.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>CARTER: These plans are incomplete. I mean, it's not even clear what's powering the weapon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Kane did say they were early schematics.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, enough to see that it's not very efficient. For example, (pointing out a feature on the schematic) these capacitors take several minutes to store enough power to fire the weapon, and then again before it can repeat.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Wow, you'd think an Ori weapon would be more advanced.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, the Ori may have designed it for them, but Rand still had to build it using the resources and technology at their disposal. Now, remember that it wouldn't take much by our standards to give Rand vast military superiority over Caledonia.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Then it can be easily destroyed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, it stands to reason. Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing even close to capable of reaching orbit. Although, there do appear to be sensors built into the targeting system, so our approach may be detected.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>TEAL'C: The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>CARTER: Exactly. As I said, even if they do see us coming, the weapon will take a few minutes to charge up. We should be able to emerge from hyperspace and take a shot at it before it can respond. If, for any reason, it doesn't go well, we jump back into hyperspace.</td></tr>
