LOCATION--SGC COMMAND CENTER

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is activating. Hammond rushes up into
     the Command Center.

  TECHNICIAN
     Receiving a signal, Sir. It's the Kelownans.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

  ANNOTATION
     The technician places his hand on the screen
     reader. The gate iris slides open.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond enters the gate room and stands at the
     bottom of the ramp. Jonas Quinn steps through the
     gate.

  HAMMOND
     Mr. Quinn, it's good to see you again.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas comes down the ramp to meet Hammond.

  JONAS
     It's good to see you too, Sir. Only wish it was
     under better circumstances. We need to talk.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is standing to make his presentation as SG-1
     and General Hammond are seated at the conference
     table.

  JONAS
     For the past several months, we've been analyzing
     the data on the crystal left behind by Thanos. It
     was the Goa'uld that occupied our planet three
     thousand years ago. Now, our progress at first was
     very slow but we recently made a major, major
     discovery. Uh... It turns out that Naquadria was
     not originally present.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas reaches into a file and pulls out some
     papers and places them in the middle of the table
     for everyone. Carter reaches for the papers

  CARTER
     What do you mean?

  JONAS
     It's not native to our planet.

  DANIEL
     I don't understand. It exists in mineral deposits
     underground.

  JONAS
     I know it does now, but we believe that those
     deposits were originally made up of ordinary
     Naquada.

  O'NEILL
     (To Carter) I assume this makes sense to you?

  CARTER
     Actually, no it doesn't.

  JONAS
     We found a reference to a process the Goa'uld
     discovered which allowed them to convert raw
     Naquada into Naquadria while it's still in the
     ground. Now somehow it started a change reaction
     which has continued on down through the veins
     getting deeper and deeper and deeper, and we
     believe that the process is ongoing.

  CARTER
     Are you saying that at this very moment, there are
     deposits of Naquada on your planet that are being
     transformed into Naquadria?

  JONAS
     Yes, one very large one in particular. We only
     recently discovered it because it's so many miles
     beneath the surface of our planet. But as the
     conversion process goes deeper, the heat and
     pressure get higher.

  CARTER
     And Naquadria is highly unstable.

  JONAS
     We believe that when it reaches a certain depth,
     it's going to explode... with enough force to
     obliterate Kelowna.


LOCATION--KELOWNA


LOCATION--KELOWNA--JONAS' LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas and Carter are there. Jonas is working on a
     laptop as Carter is checking out the lab,
     eventually making her way over to Jonas.

  JONAS
     The first few references to the conversion process
     that we found were pretty vague. To tell the
     truth, I was half convinced that I had made a
     mistake in the translation, then we came across
     these test results which show the ratio of Naquada
     to Naquadria achieved in the process. Check this
     out.

  CARTER
     So the Naquada that isn't converted breaks down
     into lighter elements?

  JONAS
     You know, for the longest time I was wondering why
     we never found any Naquadria anywhere else in the
     galaxy and now I'm thinking it's because it
     doesn't exist in nature at all.

  CARTER
     Which would explain why none of the other Goa'uld
     knew about it until Anubis probed your mind.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and a female Kelownan walks in, her
     head looking down at something in her hands.

  KIANNA
     We've got the latest geological data. It looks
     like... (Sees Carter) Oh, hello.

  CARTER
     Hi.

  JONAS
     Oh, uh... Samantha Carter this is Kianna Seer.
     Sam...Carter. She helps me out on the
     translations.

  KIANNA
     I've heard a lot about you, Major. We could really
     use your expertise right now.

  JONAS
     What do you got?

  KIANNA
     It looks like the Naquadria has progressed deeper
     then we thought.

  CARTER
     How much time do we have?

  KIANNA
     A few weeks, a month. It's hard to say.

  CARTER
     Well, We need to know how the conversion process
     works if we want to find a way to stop it.

  JONAS
     Yeah, but the information stored on the crystal is
     incomplete.

  CARTER
     Well, then we'll have to figure it out for
     ourselves.


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Klaxons sound while Hammond stands before the
     opened gate waiting for incoming travelers. Daniel
     and Hammond are standing at the bottom of the
     ramp. Three Kelownans emerge from the gate and
     walk down the ramp.

  HAMMOND
     Ambassador, welcome to Earth.

  DREYLOCK
     Actually, it's First Minister now.

  DANIEL
     (Bows his head slightly in greeting) First
     Minister.

  DREYLOCK
     (Nodding to her companions.) This is Vin Eremal
     and Lucia Tarthus. The Tiranian and Andari
     representatives on the Joint Ruling Council.

  HAMMOND
     Councilors.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond glances at Daniel then back to the
     councilors.

  HAMMOND
     Right this way.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Hammond lead the three out of the gate
     room.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Daniel and Teal'c stand at the conference
     table as the Langarans move into the room. Hammond
     moves to the head of the table.

  TARTHUS
     (somewhat perturbed) I assumed Jonas Quinn would
     be joining us.

  DREYLOCK
     He sends his apologies, but at the moment he is
     devoting his attention to the Naquadria problem.

  EREMAL
     Has any progress been made?

  ANNOTATION
     All take their seats at the conference table.

  DREYLOCK
     So far, very little I'm afraid. But I believe that
     with the participation of our friends from Earth,
     a solution will be found soon.

  DANIEL
     Of course, we all hope that's the case, however
     you may want to begin considering some contingency
     plans.

  HAMMOND
     We can offer you limited relocation through the
     Stargate.

  DREYLOCK
     Limited?

  TEAL'C
     A full evacuation of an industrialized world is a
     practical impossibility.

  TARTHUS
     I'm not sure I understand. You invited us here to
     propose that we abandon Langara?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is confused by the name and looks to
     Daniel, who is seemingly just as confused.
     Dreylock sees this.

  DREYLOCK
     Langara is the new name of our planet. It's from
     an ancient dialect common to all three nations.

  EREMAL
     (Scornful) A symbol of our new unity.

  ANNOTATION
     Emerel casts a long look at Dreylock, who reacts
     to his disdain.

  O'NEILL
     (Attempting to lighten things up) Has a nice ring
     to it.

  EREMAL
     (Not hiding his contempt) It was chosen by a
     committee.

  TARTHUS
     We understand that if this problem cannot be
     solved, Kelowna will suffer severe devastation. At
     which point, we are prepared to offer humanitarian
     aid to the survivors.

  EREMAL
     Of course, we have limited resources but we pledge
     to do what we can.

  O'NEILL
     Are you...kidding?

  DANIEL
     (puzzled) Has no one explained this to you?

  DREYLOCK
     We've tried. They seem unwilling to accept the
     truth.

  TARTHUS
     If you knew more about our history, you'd
     understand our reluctance to believe Kelownan
     propaganda.

  DANIEL
     Well, our own scientists have studied the problem,
     and while it is true that Kelowna will bear the
     brunt of the initial explosion - in fact, by our
     calculations, almost half the country's land mass
     will be destroyed - you're not taking into account
     the amount of dust and debris that'll be thrown
     into the upper atmosphere. It will block the
     sunlight and lower the average surface temperature
     significantly. For all intents and purposes, your
     entire planet will be uninhabitable.

  ANNOTATION
     Tarthus is stunned by the news, while Emerel
     shifts uncomfortably in his chair.


LOCATION--KELOWNA--JONAS' LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working out some equations on the
     blackboard, while Kianna paces with paperwork.
     Jonas is at his work table.

  KIANNA
     (Frustrated) This doesn't make any sense.
     Naquadria is a heavier, less stable isotope then
     Naquada. The conversion should require the
     continuous input of large amounts of energy.

  JONAS
     Yeah, but it seems to be continuing on its own.

  KIANNA
     Which is impossible.

  CARTER
     Not necessarily. Low energy fusion can occur in
     the presence of certain subatomic catalysts like
     muons.

  KIANNA
     But I believe that only works for extremely light
     materials such as Deuterium.

  CARTER
     Wow, Kelownan understanding of particle physics
     seems to have come a long way recently.

  KIANNA
     We're quick learners.

  CARTER
     Well, in any case, I wasn't thinking about muons
     specifically. There are certain other subatomic
     particles which could have catalyzed this
     reaction. The real question is, why didn't this
     planet blow up a long time ago?

  JONAS
     What do you mean?

  CARTER
     I think the reason you haven't been able to figure
     out the process is because you've been working
     under the assumption that this transformation
     began three thousand years ago.

  KIANNA
     But that's what the historical data indicates.

  CARTER
     Maybe so. But if you put that aside for a moment
     and assume the presence of the right catalysts,
     you can account for this reaction. It's just a lot
     faster then you thought.

  JONAS
     How much faster?

  CARTER
     Well, a deposit the size of the one you recently
     discovered could take as little as a few years to
     transform completely.

  ANNOTATION
     The room starts shaking violently. Each grab onto
     a piece of furniture as items rattle, some
     dropping from shelves. The quaking stops and they
     all look at each other.

  CARTER
     What was that?


LOCATION--SGC COMMAND CENTER

  ANNOTATION
     The klaxons are sounding while the gate is
     activated. Carter's face in on a computer monitor
     as Hammond stands.

  TECHNICIAN
     Receiving video transmission, Sir.

  HAMMOND
     (Seeing Carter) Major, what's your situation?

  CARTER
     Most of the fires that were caused by the
     Earthquake are under control now, Sir. Dr
     Frasier's organizing the distribution of medical
     supplies.

  HAMMOND
     I find it hard to believe that this was a
     coincidence.

  CARTER
     It wasn't. We traced the epicenter of the quake to
     a small deposit of converted Naquadria located
     about 20 kilometers below the surface.

  HAMMOND
     A small pocket?

  CARTER
     When the main deposit goes, Sir, we estimate the
     explosion will be about a hundred thousand times
     more powerful.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is concerned.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Langarans and SG-1 are still seated at the
     conference table.

  EREMAL
     This planet...

  TEAL'C
     Madronus.

  EREMAL
     And how far away is it?

  TEAL'C
     Approximately 14,000 light years.

  O'NEILL
     (lightly) Give or take.

  TEAL'C
     The Madronans are a peaceful, advanced society
     with the resources to accept many thousands of
     refugees.

  TARTHUS
     Jonas Quinn's reports refer to several uninhabited
     planets capable of sustaining life. The Andari
     government might consider relocation if one of
     these were made available.

  TEAL'C
     Without infrastructure, any uninhabited planet
     would not be able to sustain as many Langaran
     refugees.

  TARTHUS
     I'm not suggesting one planet for all of us.

  DANIEL
     (surprised) You want your own planet?

  TARTHUS
     The Andari people would welcome a fresh start,
     given the oppression we've suffered in the past.

  EREMAL
     The only thing you suffered under Tiranian rule
     was peace and good government.

  TARTHUS
     And mass arrests, summary executions...

  EREMAL
     In response to terrorist acts against innocent
     civilians.

  O'NEILL
     Whoaaa! Whoa! We're getting a bit off topic here,
     don't you think?

  DANIEL
     Three separate relocations is just not practical.
     Madronus is your best bet to save as many lives as
     possible.

  ANNOTATION
     The Langarans look at each other.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE


LOCATION--SGC--CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and Dreylock walk in to meet with Jonas
     and Major Carter.

  DREYLOCK
     (greeting) Jonas. Major Carter. General Hammond
     tells me that you've discovered something about
     the conversion process.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Jonas, and Jonas shrugs.

  CARTER
     Well, we determined that the transformation must
     have begun with a massive bombardment of certain
     subatomic particles which catalyze the reaction
     and allow it to continue without the input of
     energy. It's possible to create these particles in
     the lab, but there's really only one way they
     could have been produced in sufficient quantity
     and with enough energy to penetrate several miles
     into the crust of the planet.

  JONAS
     It was the Naquadria bomb test. The test that was
     conducted two years ago. We did this to ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     Dreylock looks alarmed, pensive.

  DREYLOCK
     Historical documents indicate that Thanos was
     destroyed in some cataclysmic event. Maybe this
     was the explosion that triggered the chain
     reaction.

  CARTER
     It did, at least in the case of the Naquada
     deposit near the surface.

  JONAS
     It appears that Thanos managed to create a small
     amount of Naquadria in the lab but something went
     wrong. The resulting explosion released the
     subatomic particles which catalyzed the conversion
     of the first vein of Naquada. The rest of the
     deposit transformed in less than a year.

  CARTER
     After that, it simply lay in the ground. Another
     ten-thousand years and it would have decayed back
     into Naquada, if...you hadn't mined it first.

  JONAS
     Then we set off the bomb, which started the
     conversion of the second deeper vein.

  ANNOTATION
     Dreylock takes this in.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Emerel angrily slams his hand on the table.
     Dreylock is there, along with O'Neill, Daniel,
     Teal'c and Hammond.

  EREMAL
     This is outrageous! If what you say is true, the
     Kelownan government bears full responsibility for
     the imminent destruction of Langara!

  DREYLOCK
     Your governments formed an alliance for the
     expressed purpose of attacking Kelowna, we were
     merely looking to defend ourselves.

  TARTHUS
     We only went to a heightened war alert after we
     learned of your research.

  DREYLOCK
     Which only goes to prove that you were spying on
     us.

  TARTHUS
     What choice did we have? We certainly weren't
     going to rely on the Kelownan government to tell
     us the truth.

  DANIEL
     Councilors, please.

  EREMAL
     These talks will have to be suspended until I can
     confer with my cabinet.

  O'NEILL
     (Pissed) Aw, for crying out loud!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel moves a glass away from O'Neill

  DANIEL
     Jack...

  O'NEILL
     Who cares whose fault it is?!

  DANIEL
     Jack...

  O'NEILL
     Your planet is gonna blow up!

  DANIEL
     Jack!

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) The whole damn planet, Daniel!

  DANIEL
     Okay. I think it's best if we all just take a
     little recess right now.

  O'NEILL
     (rising from his chair disgustedly) Arrgh.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel joins him as they pass Hammond and Teal'c
     on their way out walk towards the door.

  O'NEILL
     (acknowledging) General.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond nods as they exit.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel are walking. O'Neill is
     leading the way as he irritably stomps along the
     corridor.

  O'NEILL
     I say we send `em packin'.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  DANIEL
     (beseechingly) We can't give up on them yet. We
     still have the potential to save thousands of
     lives here.

  O'NEILL
     And yet, curiously, they don't seem to understand,
     nor care.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at an elevator.

  DANIEL
     This is diplomacy, Jack. This is the way the game
     is played. It takes patience.

  ANNOTATION
     The elevator door opens.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah? Well I'm fresh out.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps into the elevator. Teal'c follows.

  TEAL'C
     As am I.

  O'NEILL
     (To Daniel) I think you're on your own.

  ANNOTATION
     The elevator doors close and Daniel turns away
     from the elevator, annoyed.


LOCATION--KELOWNA


LOCATION--KELOWNA--JONAS' LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Kianna stands at the blackboard while Carter and
     Jonas are at separate desks.

  KIANNA
     (sighing) No matter how many times we go over
     this, we're still going to come to the same
     conclusion. There's simply no way to reverse the
     process.

  CARTER
     Maybe we don't have to. According to the latest
     geological data, there's a minor fault line
     crossing the vein of Naquada, about a kilometer
     above the large deposit.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter hands the papers containing the data to
     Jonas.

  CARTER
     If we could somehow trigger a move along the fault
     line, we could isolate the advancing Naquadria and
     break off the chain reaction before it gets any
     deeper.

  KIANNA
     And how do we do that?

  CARTER
     We set off a large explosion near the fault.
     Stargate Command could provide a small nuclear
     device that would do the trick. The only problem
     is that we'd have to get down there. Which means
     drilling through 20 kilometers of solid rock.

  ANNOTATION
     Kianna and Jonas give each other long, knowing
     looks. Carter picks up on this.

  CARTER
     What?

  JONAS
     There's something I wanna show you.


LOCATION--KELOWNA--HUGE INDUSTRIAL FACILITY

  ANNOTATION
     Pan down a tremendous structure that appears to be
     what looks like a huge drill. Carter, Jonas and
     Kianna walk up to it.

  JONAS
     It took us two and a half years to build, and it
     cost over half the annual Kelownan research
     budget. The Deep Underground Excavation Vehicle.

  CARTER
     (Nods in awe) Cool.


LOCATION--KELOWNA--WITHIN THE VEHICLE'S CONTROL CENTER

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas switches on a monitor of the drill. Carter
     is looking around. Kianna is there, too.

  JONAS
     The...uh...fore and aft sections have both been
     outfitted with titanium cutter heads. Each of
     which can withstand or apply thrust of up to fifty
     metric tons.

  CARTER
     What kind of an advance rate are we talking about?

  JONAS
     Uh...about 80 meters per hour. Hey, look I know
     it's not fast enough but I do have an idea for a
     little adjustment that will give us a lot more
     speed.

  CARTER
     Tokra tunnel crystals!

  JONAS
     Modified, of course, to work in conjunction with
     the cutter heads.

  CARTER
     Pretty impressive. Do you mind if I take a look at
     your power systems?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas points up a ladder.

  JONAS
     After you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter climbs up the ladder. Kianna takes Jonas's
     arm and leads him away.

  KIANNA
     (whispers) Do we have to show her everything?

  JONAS
     Kianna...

  KIANNA
     Everybody has an agenda, Jonas, and her people
     have made no secret of their interest in our
     Naquadria deposits.

  JONAS
     Look, I've wanted to come forward with this for a
     long time, but I always got overruled by the
     cabinet. Now we have no choice.

  KIANNA
     We don't need her. We can go to the Tok'ra
     ourselves.

  JONAS
     I worked with these people for over a year, I
     trust them with my life.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss.

  JONAS
     Don't worry.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas walks away, but Kianna is not reassured.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Hammond are now left to deal with the
     Langarans.

  TARTHUS
     The machine was designed to mine Naquadria and
     according to the terms of our alliance, any
     information relating to Naquadria is to be shared.
     We were purposely misled.

  DREYLOCK
     We had every intention of telling you once the
     prototype was fully operational.

  EREMAL
     Do you take us for idiots? It was you that created
     this disaster, and now you expect to benefit by
     acquiring alien technology?

  DANIEL
     (Clearing his throat loudly) I think we can all
     agree that it's unfortunate the Kelownan
     government didn't come forward with this
     information sooner. Um, however, regarding the
     Tok'ra crystals, you really have no choice.
     Without them, we won't be able to reach the
     Naquadria vein in time to save your world. It's
     that simple.

     The delegation are quiet.

  CARTER
     Wow, Jonas. This technology is beyond anything
     I've seen in Kelowna before.

  JONAS
     Well, I did make a few suggestions for some
     adjustments based on what I learned at Stargate
     Command.

  CARTER
     Pretty amazing.

  JONAS
     Yeah. I'll tell you, most of the credit goes to
     Kianna.

  CARTER
     Kianna?

  JONAS
     Yeah, she took what she learned from me and she
     made modifications to the hydraulics, the
     shielding mechanisms, everything. I'm telling you,
     without her, this thing would be months away from
     being operational.

  CARTER
     So you two have been working pretty closely on
     this.

  JONAS
     Yeah, I guess.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Jonas.

  JONAS
     What!?

  CARTER
     (teasing) Come on Jonas, I'm not blind. What's
     going on?

  JONAS
     Let's just say that it's in the development stage,
     although I do find her interesting.

  CARTER
     I'll bet you do.

     Indeed. The crystals you requested.

  DANIEL
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c casts a glance up to the Briefing Room
     window overlooking the gate room. Tarthus and
     Dreylock are standing there talking.

  TEAL'C
     How are the negotiations progressing?

  DANIEL
     Well, they finally agreed to send a three person
     delegation to Madronus evaluate the planet as a
     potential evacuation site.

  TEAL'C
     What of Jonas Quinn and Major Carter?

  HAMMOND
     They're making some final adjustments to the
     Kelownan excavation machine. It should be ready
     for launch within 24 hours.

     Carter comes down the ladder and joins Jonas at
     his computer console.

  JONAS
     (to Carter) Hey! Just in time to help me run a few
     diagnostic programs.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Jonas, thoughtfully. Jonas sees
     this.

  JONAS
     What?

  CARTER
     Jonas, did you design the primary power
     distribution circuits?

  JONAS
     Well, I didn't really design anything. I did make
     some suggestions for some upgrades, but...

  CARTER
     Based on advanced technology you encountered while
     you were with

  SG-1.


  JONAS
     Yeah, that's right. Why? What's wrong?

  CARTER
     Well the hardware is different. But the basic
     principle is very similar to a Goa'uld design.

  JONAS
     Well, that's impossible.

  CARTER
     I went over it three times. I probably wouldn't
     have even noticed myself if I hadn't calculated
     that the generators were operating at 130%
     efficiency.

  JONAS
     (disbelieving) No... there's some mistake.

  CARTER
     Jonas, who did design the system?

  ANNOTATION
     Quin looks at Carter.


LOCATION--KELOWNA--JONAS' LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Kianna walks down a corridor and into Jonas's lab
     where Carter, Jonas and two Guards are waiting.
     The two Guards grab Kianna.

  KIANNA
     (surprised) Jonas, what's going on?

  JONAS
     (Eyeing her angrily) We know.

  KIANNA
     What are you talking about?

  JONAS
     Who do you serve?

  KIANNA
     Jonas whatever you think... whatever she told you,
     is a lie.

  CARTER
     They searched your quarters. Do you want to
     explain why they found a Goa'uld communication
     device among your personal belongings?

  ANNOTATION
     Caught out, Kianna hangs her head, dropping her
     papers. Then she looks up and her eyes glow.

  KIANNA
     (Goa'uld voice) Very well, you know the truth.
     Now, how shall we proceed?

  ANNOTATION
     One of the guards pulls a small object from
     Kianna's jacket. Carter moves closer to examine
     the object.

  CARTER
     I'm assuming that this is the drug that allowed
     you to escape detection. It somehow masks the
     presence of the symbiote, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pauses for an answer.

  CARTER
     You don't have to tell me, I'm sending this back
     to the SGC for analysis.

  JONAS
     How long have you been on this planet?

  KIANNA
     We knew Anubis came here for a reason. After his
     defeat, I was dispatched to find out why he was so
     interested in this place.

  CARTER
     So you work for Ba'al?

  KIANNA
     I gained access to Kelowna's most sensitive
     research by implanting myself in a young scientist
     who was working on the Naquadria project.

  JONAS
     Let me talk to Kianna.

  KIANNA
     In a small way I've grown to admire this host. She
     is exceptionally astute, a superior specimen.

  JONAS
     Let me talk to her.

  KIANNA
     I made the major modifications to the excavator.
     If you wish to successfully complete this
     undertaking, you will require my assistance.

  CARTER
     Why would you help us?

  KIANNA
     We share a common goal: I too wish to save this
     world.

  JONAS
     So you can hand it over to Ba'al? I don't think
     so.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas turns his back on her. Kianna steps forward
     but it restrained by the guards.

  KIANNA
     Jonas!

  JONAS
     (turns to her) Kianna?

  KIANNA
     She's right, you're going to need her. Let her
     help you, for the sake of our people.

  CARTER
     It's not her Jonas. It's the Goa'uld trying to
     fool us. We've seen it before.

  KIANNA
     No. Jonas, please.

  JONAS
     (to the guards, disgusted) Get her out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     The guards take Kianna away.

  CARTER
     The drills are running hot.

  JONAS
     Alright, bring down your RPMs. Don't
     overcompensate.

  CARTER
     I can't stay ahead of these adjustments.

  JONAS
     You're going to stall us out. Power up!

  ANNOTATION
     The engines stop.

  JONAS
     (sighing) You stripped the drill heads. Control,
     end simulation.

  CARTER
     Jonas, we've got a problem.

  ANNOTATION
     He nods knowingly.

LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Tarthus stands, looking out over the gate room.
     Hammond and Daniel stand as well, Emerel and
     Dreylock remain seated.

  TARTHUS
     Could this be the result of Goa'uld sabotage?

  HAMMOND
     Quite the contrary. Major Carter believes the
     Goa'uld's modifications have significantly
     improved the speed and efficiency of the drills.

  DANIEL
     You see, the problem is the system requires
     constant subtle adjustments to account for any
     changes in the density of the material that it's
     passing through. It's kind of like shifting gears
     on a racecar.

  ANNOTATION
     The Langarans are confused by the analogy.

  DANIEL
     Um, the point is that Major Carter isn't confident
     in her own ability to run the drill. She thinks
     the best person for the job is the Goa'uld.

  TARTHUS
     (scoffing) You can't be serious.

  HAMMOND
     We could overhaul the system and eliminate the
     modifications, but that would significantly reduce
     the speed of the excavator and it would take
     weeks.

  EREMAL
     We don't have that kind of time.

  DANIEL
     The Goa'uld could have sabotaged the excavator any
     time she wanted to. Instead, she helped Jonas
     improved several of its key systems.

  DREYLOCK
     Only because she wishes to preserve the Naquadria
     deposit for Ba'al.

  HAMMOND
     Maybe so, but averting the explosion is our first
     priority, and without the Goa'uld, we have no
     chance.

  ANNOTATION
     The Langarans are quiet as further arguments are
     moot.

     Kianna comes down the ladder. Teal'c, Carter and
     Jonas are there. She strolls past them to the
     console.

  KIANNA
     You've made the right choice. Your confidence in
     me will not go unrewarded.

  CARTER
     We have no choice. And for the record, our
     confidence in you is minimal.

  KIANNA
     Which is, no doubt, why the Sho'lva will be
     accompanying us?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Teal'c, while Kianna gazes around
     the room at the other three's weapons.

  KIANNA
     And why all of you are armed?

  ANNOTATION
     Kianna turns back to the console.

  KIANNA
     Who calibrated the primary inductors?

  CARTER
     I did.

  KIANNA
     Launch now and you will burn through them before
     you pass a hundred metres.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter bristles.

  CARTER
     (sarcastically) All right. I'll take navigation.
     Teal'c, take shields and life support.

  HAMMOND
     (approaching the table) We've just received word
     from Kelowna.

  DREYLOCK
     Our security personnel has been monitoring a
     communication device we took from Kianna's
     quarters. Apparently, a message has come through
     from Ba'al.

  HAMMOND
     She's overdue to report. He's waiting for her to
     send a transmission.

  EREMAL
     And if she doesn't?

  TARTHUS
     He'll come back to find out what happened.

  HAMMOND

  KIANNA
     We are losing coolant pressure in one of the
     forward tubes. We must have broken a seal.
     (getting up from her seat) Major Carter, take the
     controls.

     Carter takes her position and Teal'c takes
     Carter's vacated seat.

  JONAS
     (to Kianna) Where are you going?

  KIANNA
     I can divert coolant from the aft section, but I
     have to do it from the engine room.

  JONAS
     I'm coming with you.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets up and follows her.

  EREMAL
     Is there anyway to contact the excavator.

  DREYLOCK
     They're too deep. No radio signal could penetrate

  DANIEL
     It won't make much difference. Telling them about
     Ba'al's message will not change anything.

  TARTHUS
     But if the Goa'uld doesn't make it back.

  HAMMOND
     The only reason that would happen is if the
     mission fails. And if that's the case, Ba'al will
     be the least of your problems. I suggest we get

     gauge) We're good.

  ANNOTATION
     Kianna and he look at each other.

  KIANNA
     Maybe now you'll believe that I, too, wish this
     mission to succeed?

  JONAS
     Yeah, for the wrong reasons.

  KIANNA
     Has it ever occurred to you that serving Ba'al may
     not be my only interest here? I never thought I'd
     find the company of a human so intriguing.

  ANNOTATION
     She trys to touch him but he brushes her hand
     away.

  KIANNA
     And suddenly I repulse you? Not that long ago you
     felt differently.

  JONAS
     Yeah, well that was before I found out who you
     are. What you are.

  KIANNA
     And yet the fact remains, you never knew the host

  CARTER
     Jonas, is there any volcanic activity in the area?

  JONAS
     Mount Kallan. But it's been dormant for hundreds
     of years.

  CARTER
     Just because it's dormant at the surface, doesn't
     mean there couldn't be magma flows in the
     vicinity.

     Daniel, how's the whole diplomacy thing working
     out for you?

  DANIEL
     It's not. (frustrated) The latest arguements about
     the selection process. The Kelownans want a
     lottery. The Tiranians want to assign positions
     and the Andaris wanna set up a committee to
     discuss the problem.

  O'NEILL

     weeks.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry Jonas but we don't have a choice.

  JONAS
     We still have some Tokra crystals in reserve. We
     can use those to tunnel the rest of the way.

  CARTER
     They'd never make it far enough.

  JONAS
     Yeah, but if we focus them, we can at least dig a
     passage big enough for one person. That would give
     us the distance we need.

  CARTER
     It might work. But at this depth, the heat and the
     noxious gasses would penetrate even a Tokra
     tunnel. It will be suicide.

  KIANNA
     I will go.

  ANNOTATION
     They all look at her.

  KIANNA
     Do not worry, Major Carter. I may be intrigued by
     your willingness to sacrifice yourself for others,
     but I do not share it. My symbiote will protect
     me.

  CARTER
     Why take the risk?

  KIANNA
     You still think of me as nothing but a servant of
     Ba'al. You are mistaken.

     (keying the microphone) Kianna, this is Jonas.
     Come in, over. Please respond.

  TEAL'C
     I believe we have no choice but to begin our
     ascent immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear a bang on the hull below the shaft exit.
     Opening the door, Kianna is weakly hanging on to
     the rungs of the shaft's ladder. Teal'c reaches in
     and pulls her up. She is bruised and bloody, and
     he hands her over to Jonas.

  JONAS
     (taking Kianna) All right, I'll take care of her.
     Get us out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter heads over to the console and Teal'c takes
     his station.

  CARTER
     Powering up engines.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas closes the shaft.

  TEAL'C
     Beginning ascent.

  KIANNA
     (Looking at Jonas) You waited.

  JONAS
     You held up your end of the bargain.

  KIANNA
     Was that your only reason?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas says nothing.

  KIANNA
     (smiling weakly) I already know your answer.

  ANNOTATION
     She closes her eyes.

  PA SYSTEM
     Unscheduled Offworld Activation

  TECHNICIAN
     Receiving a signal sir. Audio only.

  HAMMOND
     Put it though.

  KELOWNAN
     (via radio) Kelownan gate control to First
     Minister Dreylock.

  DREYLOCK
     This is Dreylock. Go ahead.

  KELOWNAN
     We're receiving reports from all over the country
     - a major seismic disturbance. Geological survery
     places the epicentre at the target coordinates.

  EREMAL
     They did it!

  DREYLOCK
     Any word from the excavator.

  KELOWNAN
     Negative.


LOCATION--KELOWNA--EXCAVATOR INTERIOR

  ANNOTATION
     The vehicle shudders as it continues to make its
     ascent to the surface.

  TEAL'C
     Power reserves are nearly depleted.

  CARTER
     We're almost there. Ten seconds.

  CARTER
     Five seconds...four...three...two...one.

LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is standing on the ramp, staring at the gate
     when Daniel enters.

  DANIEL
     Miss it?

  JONAS
     Yeah, I do.

  ANNOTATION
     The gate begins to activate.

  DANIEL
     Well, judging from what you have to deal with back
     on Kelowna, I'm not surprised. I think I'd take
     life-threatening danger over one of those council
     meetings any day of the week.

  JONAS
     Yeah, I tell ya, I don't know what Jack said to
     them, but they are being a little bit more
     cooperative.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, let's hope it lasts.

  ANNOTATION
     Kianna enters the gate room, a bit bruised and
     battered, accompanied by Carter.

  JONAS
     How are you feeling?

  KIANNA
     Fine, I guess. I don't remember everything. It's
     like a dream

  CARTER
     The symbiote's dead.

  KIANNA
     She saved me. She could have let me die with her,
     but she didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     The gate opens.

  KIANNA
     I know you may find this hard to believe, but she
     appreciated everything that you did for her. What
     you tried to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas nods. He looks around a bit awkwardly, then
     shrugs.

  JONAS
     (smiling) Time to go home.

  ANNOTATION
     He shakes hands with Daniel and then walks up the
     ramp with Kianna. Carter and Daniel watch as both
     walk to the event horizon and back to Kelowna.
