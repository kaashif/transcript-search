<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>JONAS: For the past several months, we've been analyzing the data on the crystal left behind by Thanos. It was the Goa'uld that occupied our planet three thousand years ago. Now, our progress at first was very slow but we recently made a major, major discovery. Uh... It turns out that Naquadria was not originally present.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Jonas reaches into a file and pulls out some papers and places them in the middle of the table for everyone. Carter reaches for the papers</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>DANIEL: I don't understand. It exists in mineral deposits underground.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>JONAS: I know it does now, but we believe that those deposits were originally made up of ordinary Naquada.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>JONAS: We found a reference to a process the Goa'uld discovered which allowed them to convert raw Naquada into Naquadria while it's still in the ground. Now somehow it started a change reaction which has continued on down through the veins getting deeper and deeper and deeper, and we believe that the process is ongoing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>CARTER: Are you saying that at this very moment, there are deposits of Naquada on your planet that are being transformed into Naquadria?</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>JONAS: Yes, one very large one in particular. We only recently discovered it because it's so many miles beneath the surface of our planet. But as the conversion process goes deeper, the heat and pressure get higher.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>CARTER: And Naquadria is highly unstable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>JONAS: The first few references to the conversion process that we found were pretty vague. To tell the truth, I was half convinced that I had made a mistake in the translation, then we came across these test results which show the ratio of Naquada to Naquadria achieved in the process. Check this out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>CARTER: So the Naquada that isn't converted breaks down into lighter elements?</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>JONAS: You know, for the longest time I was wondering why we never found any Naquadria anywhere else in the galaxy and now I'm thinking it's because it doesn't exist in nature at all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>CARTER: Which would explain why none of the other Goa'uld knew about it until Anubis probed your mind.</td></tr>

It will block the sunlight and lower the average surface temperature significantly. For all intents and purposes, your entire planet will be uninhabitable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>KIANNA: (Frustrated) This doesn't make any sense. Naquadria is a heavier, less stable isotope then Naquada. The conversion should require the continuous input of large amounts of energy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, in any case, I wasn't thinking about muons specifically. There are certain other subatomic particles which could have catalyzed this reaction. The real question is, why didn't this planet blow up a long time ago?</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>JONAS: What do you mean?</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>CARTER: I think the reason you haven't been able to figure out the process is because you've been working under the assumption that this transformation began three thousand years ago.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>CARTER: Maybe so. But if you put that aside for a moment and assume the presence of the right catalysts, you can account for this reaction. It's just a lot faster then you thought.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>JONAS: How much faster?</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, a deposit the size of the one you recently discovered could take as little as a few years to transform completely.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>CARTER: It wasn't. We traced the epicenter of the quake to a small deposit of converted Naquadria located about 20 kilometers below the surface.</td></tr>
