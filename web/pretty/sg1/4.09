<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>CARTER: (to Hammond) We estimate the ship to be about two miles in diameter. The curtain of energy it's using to sweep the landscape stretches for over twenty miles. It seems to be depositing a yet unknown gas like substance that is spreading like a wake behind the ship. Now it extends beyond the range of the UAV but it appears to cover hundreds of miles.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>DANIEL: Teal'c said he hadn't seen the technology before.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>DANIEL: There don't appear to be any recognisable or discernible markings on the ship. If there's any good news it would appear that whoever's in control doesn't have any specific intention of attacking the Enkarrans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>CARTER: (to Hammond) Sir, the Colonel's right. Based on the ships current speed I estimate it will take approximately 26 hours to reach Hedrazar's village.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>CARTER: The concern is where to send them. Even low level radiation can cause the Enkarrans to go blind. Without the density of ozone on this particular planet they'll all die.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>DANIEL: The only other planet we know with similar conditions is the Enkaran home world and according to Enkaran verbal history there's no Stargate there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>CARTER: Even if we had a method of transportation the Enkarans of today would have no concept of where that planet is in the galaxy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>CARTER: A matter of days. Their condition would degrade the longer they were here.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>DANIEL: There are thousands of them outside of Hedrazar's village spread a fair distance from the gate. It took us two weeks to transplant them to P5S-381 in the first place.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>CARTER: It's a little bit more than that Sir. The microbes are only deposited after all of the native organisms have been destroyed. I think they're meant to replace them. Now if my theory is correct we're looking at the first building blocks of an alien ecosystem.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel stands up from looking down the microscope realising what Carter is getting at.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>DANIEL: It's a terraformer.</td></tr>
