The Quest Part 1
TEASER

LOCATION--VILLAGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Adria comes to stand on a balcony overlooking the
     villagers. They cheer for her.

  TEAL'C
     (voiceover) According to those who witnessed the
     battle, the enemy is led by a young woman of
     extraordinary powers.


LOCATION--STORAGE ROOM, LEVEL 16

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al holds Carter hostage. She works at a
     computer terminal.

  CARTER
     You want Merlin's weapon for yourselves.

  BA'AL ONE
     A weapon capable of destroying not only the Ori,
     but the Ancients as well.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are in Daniel's office.

  DANIEL
     I did find one reference in that library that
     might prove to be useful--Atlantis.

  CARTER
     You think the location of Merlin's weapon is
     hidden in their database?

  DANIEL
     I think it's worth checking out.


LOCATION--ATLANTIS LIBRARY HOLO-ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala are speaking to Morgan Le Fay.

  DANIEL
     We're looking for the names of two planets, known
     on Earth in ancient times in the dialect of Old
     English as Castiana and Sahal. (to Vala)
     Satisfied?

  MORGAN LE FAY
     Taoth Vaclarush, and Valos Cor.

  ANNOTATION
     The planets and their addresses become visible in
     the map hologram.

  END EXCERPTS



LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sits at a table near his computer monitor.
     There are several books open nearby, and he is
     holding a piece of paper. Mitchell and Teal'c
     arrive in the doorway.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, Jackson, what are you doing?

  DANIEL
     (nonchalant, not looking up) Oh, just trying to
     figure out the location of Merlin's weapon so we
     can find it in time to defeat the Ori, hopefully
     save our galaxy. You?

  MITCHELL
     We're going for Szechwan. You want to come?

  DANIEL
     No, I'll pass.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell gestures as if it's Daniel's loss, then
     starts to leave.

  TEAL'C
     How is your search coming, Daniel Jackson?

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures for Mitchell to stop, and he does.

  DANIEL
     Slowly, but I think I'm onto something.
     (gesturing) Here, take a look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     He finally looks over at them in the doorway.
     Mitchell tilts his head as if reluctant, then he
     and Teal'c walk over and stand beside Daniel.
     Daniel changes the display on his computer
     terminal. A star map appears.

  DANIEL
     These are the locations of the planets that Arthur
     and his knights set off to in their quest for the
     Sangreal. Castiana, Sahal, and Vagonbrei. Now we
     searched all three and came up empty, so I thought
     it was a dead end, until I noticed this...

  ANNOTATION
     He changes the display to show the relative
     positions of the three worlds. He hits a button
     that shows equal-length lines between the planets,
     when projected onto a 2-dimensional plane.

  DANIEL
     Their coordinates form an equilateral triangle.
     Now, add their departure point, the Camelot
     planet, and you get...

  ANNOTATION
     He taps another key, and a fourth point emerges,
     offset into the screen on a different plane. A
     wire diagram of a pyramid appears and spins into
     place.

  DANIEL
     A tetrahedron. A perfect pyramid.

  MITCHELL
     Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.

  DANIEL
     Exactly, and it means something. I'm just... not
     sure what.


LOCATION--VALA'S QUARTERS

  ANNOTATION
     Vala awakens suddenly. She is wearing a green gel
     mask around her eyes. She throws back the covers
     and gets up very quickly.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is still working, putting his glasses back
     on. Vala rushes in, wearing a robe over her
     pajamas, and still wearing the gel mask.

  VALA
     I have the answer! I figured it out. Whoo.

  ANNOTATION
     She whisks the mask up onto her head. Daniel takes
     note of her but doesn't really react.

  VALA
     Those three planets are part of a puzzle.

  DANIEL
     (uncapping his pen) This much I already know.

  VALA
     The pyramid is a visual representation of "three
     into one." Three addresses into one. That's what
     Morgan was trying to tell you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pauses, interested.

  VALA
     That the Sangreal is located on a planet, the
     address of which is made up of symbols from each
     of those three worlds: Castiana, Sahal, Vagonbrei.
     It just came to me in a dream.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, NIGHT


LOCATION--CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter works at a laptop, Daniel on her left and
     Vala on her right. Vala is drinking coffee and
     still wearing the gel mask atop her head.

  CARTER
     Okay, this program will cross reference the
     addresses in the database with those of Castiana,
     Sahal, and Vagonbrei, searching out planetary
     designations made up of symbols from all three
     addresses.

  ANNOTATION
     Her computer monitor shows the three addresses in
     three rows. The symbols start rotating through
     like a slot machine as the search commences.

  CARTER
     Given the number of symbols and the amount of
     addresses in the database, we could be looking at
     dozens, maybe hundreds of permutations.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala sighs and slumps sleepily against Carter's
     arm. Carter looks down, surprised. The computer
     search stops and beeps, and all three look at the
     display in shock.

  CARTER
     Or, maybe just the one!

  ANNOTATION
     The computer screen shows a single address found
     by the search.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The village has multi-story buildings with steeply
     pitched roofs and smoking chimneys. Green hills
     sit in the background.


LOCATION--VILLAGE STREET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers, dressed in simple but colorful
     clothing, stop and stare as SG-1 walks down the
     bricked street. SG-1 is dressed in green BDU's
     with full vests and weapons.

  DANIEL
     The culture and level of technology looks similar
     to what we found on the Camelot planet.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, I'm going to assume that's a good thing... I
     think some of these folks have figured out we're
     not from around here. (to nearby villagers) Uh,
     excuse me! I was wondering if we could get some
     help.

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers stop and listen attentively.

  MITCHELL
     A little information?

  DANIEL
     We've come in search of the Sangreal.

  MITCHELL
     (gesturing with his thumb and finger) It's a red
     thing about 'yay' big.

  VILLAGER
     We know what the Sangreal looks like. It's been
     many generations since anyone has come in search
     of it. And now you're the second group of
     adventurers in less than a week to take up the
     quest.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 exchanges looks.

  VALA
     The second group.

  VILLAGER
     (stepping toward them) A number of Jaffa passed
     through here three days ago.

  CARTER
     Were they accompanied by anyone?

  VILLAGER
     Uh, yes. They were led by a man who clearly
     commanded their fear and respect.

  TEAL'C
     Ba'al has been here.

  DANIEL
     And he's got a three-day head start on us.

  VILLAGER
     If you truly seek the Sangreal, you must consult
     with the Parchment of Virtues in the village
     library.

  ANNOTATION
     He points across the square.

  VILLAGER
     It will prepare you for the journey to come.

  MITCHELL
     (pointing the same direction) Over there?

  ANNOTATION
     The villager nods.

  MITCHELL
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 starts to walk in that direction. Behind them
     the villager calls out. SG-1 turns back around.

  VILLAGER
     But I should warn you. No one has ever returned
     from the Quest alive. If you value your lives, you
     would do well to reconsider.

  MITCHELL
     We appreciate that, but that is quitter talk.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell nods in satisfaction, and SG-1 heads
     toward the library.


LOCATION--VILLAGE LIBRARY

  ANNOTATION
     The library is poorly lit; rolls of parchment sit
     on a shelf. SG-1 approaches the door, which has a
     window in it. Mitchell opens the door and leads
     the team cautiously inside.

  MITCHELL
     (calling out) Hello!

  ANNOTATION
     They all come inside.

  VALA
     Right. Parchment of Virtues. Do we look under "P"
     for parchment or "V" for virtues?

  DANIEL
     I say look for any and all materials related to
     the Sangreal.

  OSRIC
     (from another room) Or you could simply ask me!

  ANNOTATION
     Osric, an elderly man, speaks from a low stairway;
     they turn to look at him. He walks to the landing
     just above the team.

  OSRIC
     I am Osric, keeper of the village archives.

  CARTER
     Hi. We're looking for something called the
     Parchment of Virtues.

  OSRIC
     (slowly descending stairs) Ah, another band of
     stalwart heroes come to tempt fate in the hopes of
     claiming the legendary prize.

  ANNOTATION
     He sounds quite infirm, and Carter looks dubious.

  TEAL'C
     What do you know of the Sangreal?

  OSRIC
     Only what I have heard from legend. That it is
     located in a cave beyond the outlying forest. But,
     that the journey there is fraught with peril.

  ANNOTATION
     He has walked over to a wooden ladder on the floor
     and begins to climb it.

  OSRIC
     Ages ago, Morgan Le Fay enchanted the area with a
     terrible curse.

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches for and takes a long wooden box. Carter
     takes it from him, and he descends the ladder.

  OSRIC
     Since then it has claimed countless lives.

  DANIEL
     Well, we don't put much stock in curses, so...

  OSRIC
     Neither did Phaedra, the cobbler's wife. Several
     weeks ago, she set off in search of her son who
     had strayed too far from the village. Neither have
     been seen nor heard from since.

  ANNOTATION
     As he speaks, he takes the wooden box back from
     Carter and puts it on the table. He opens it,
     removing a small parchment.

  OSRIC
     This parchment was purportedly left behind by
     Morgan herself, as a guide for knights of noble
     spirit, since it is said that only the most
     virtuous will succeed in claiming the Sangreal.

  DANIEL
     (reading and translating parchment) Only those of
     virtue true may win the prize concealed beyond the
     reach of the flawed and tainted. The Sangreal
     shall instead belong to he who speaks the
     guardian's name. (confused) Guardian's name?

  OSRIC
     They say that the Sangreal is protected by the
     most powerful of magical beasts -- a dragon.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 displays skeptical looks.

  DANIEL
     Dragon?

  OSRIC
     (disbelieving) You doubt the legend?

  CARTER
     Well, I'm sure the Sangreal is protected by
     something very powerful, but I don't think it's an
     actual dragon.

  OSRIC
     (laughing) Believe what you will. With luck you
     may have the opportunity to prove the truth for
     yourselves.

  DANIEL
     (translating) Prudence, wisdom, charity, kindness,
     and faith. Let these be your guide on this
     perilous quest.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks around and at Vala as if he was expecting
     more.

  VALA
     (to Osric) Well, I'm sorry, but I think we're
     going to need a little bit more than that to go
     on.

  OSRIC
     No, all Morgan left behind was this parchment.

  ANNOTATION
     He rolls up the parchment and places it back in
     the wooden box.

  OSRIC
     And... the map.

  CARTER
     Uh, there's a map?

  OSRIC
     (laughing) Yes.

  TEAL'C
     May we see it?

  OSRIC
     No!

  CARTER
     Why not?

  ANNOTATION
     Osric has walked over to the ladder but turns back
     around.

  OSRIC
     (amazed and hurt) I showed it to the last group of
     adventurers who came in search of the Sangreal,
     and they rewarded my trust by trying to take it!

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, we uh, know the guy that runs that
     operation. We're not like him.

  OSRIC
     (waving his hands in dismissal) Ah ha, well. I'm
     sorry! It is not for public view.

  ANNOTATION
     Still carrying the box, he walks back to the
     staircase and starts to climb it.

  VALA
     Hey! We wouldn't dream of trying to steal it!

  OSRIC
     Yeah, heh heh.

  ANNOTATION
     He disappears around a corner, laughing.


LOCATION--VILLAGE TAVERN

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 is seated at a long wooden table, Carter at
     the head. Daniel is eating peanuts from a bowl,
     discarding the shells on the table.

  VALA
     We have to steal it!

  CARTER
     We are not stealing the map!

  VALA
     Nightfall. Sneak in under cover of darkness.

  DANIEL
     Maybe if I can just talk to Osric and convince him
     that our cause is virtuous.

  VALA
     Oh, that's brilliant. And while you're distracting
     him, the rest of us can steal it.

  CARTER
     For the last time, we are not steal--

  ANNOTATION
     A female barkeep arrives with metal cups of drink
     for them and start setting them on the table.

  BARKEEP
     Are you certain I cannot tempt you with a final
     meal?

  MITCHELL
     What is it with this town and the no-can-do
     attitude? Every time we turn around, someone's
     trying to write us off or scare us away!

  BARKEEP
     I apologize. I should have said a final meal
     before you set off on your journey.

  MITCHELL
     Now that's better.

  BARKEEP
     Although it need be said in the many thousands of
     years that adventurers have been seeking the
     Sangreal, not one has succeeded.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a disturbance outside. Teal'c gets up and
     walks over to the doorway to look, Mitchell beside
     him. Through the doorway they see soldiers of the
     Ori herding the citizens.


LOCATION--VILLAGE STREET, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Ori soldiers herd weakly resisting villagers down
     the street toward the square.

  VILLAGER
     What is this?! What do you want here?

  ANNOTATION
     A soldier hits him in the stomach with his staff
     weapon, and he falls to the ground.


LOCATION--VILLAGE TAVERN

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 sees this and gets up, readying their
     weapons.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A villager comes running at the soldier with a
     knife. The soldier shoots him with a staff weapon
     and he falls. The other villager is kneeling
     beside him, and a third villager comes to the aid
     of the one who was shot.

  ORI SOLDIER
     (loudly, to villagers) We are soldiers of the Ori.


LOCATION--VILLAGE TAVERN

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 listens and watches through the windows.

  ORI SOLDIER
     And we have taken this village as part of their
     holy crusade, to rid this galaxy of evil.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

  ORI SOLDIER
     Cooperate, and you won't be harmed.

  ANNOTATION
     The soldier walks over to another soldier.

  ORI SOLDIER
     Go through the buildings. Bring everyone out.


LOCATION--VILLAGE TAVERN

  ANNOTATION
     The barkeep watches the happenings with SG-1.

  BARKEEP
     Who are these men?

  MITCHELL
     Well, that is a long story.

  ANNOTATION
     They step away from the window.

  MITCHELL
     Look, I know you have no reason to trust us
     anymore than you do those guys.

  BARKEEP
     I have not see you shoot anyone.

  MITCHELL
     That's an excellent point. (placing a hand on her
     shoulder) We're gonna need your help.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A soldier brings an armful of books and throws
     them onto a large pile of other books. The lead
     soldier adds books to the pile as well. The
     villagers look on. Included are SG-1, dressed with
     cloaks over their BDU's and weapons.

  CARTER
     They've got a dozen men guarding the gate. Another
     fifty or so in and around the village.

  MITCHELL
     Is that what I think it is?

  DANIEL
     The contents of the library.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his glasses on. A soldier puts some
     parchment rolls on top of the mound of books. A
     box sits on top of the same type Osric had used to
     contain the Parchment of Virtue. From a balcony
     overlooking the square and pile of books, a Prior
     appears.

  PRIOR
     You have spent your time ignorant to the truth,
     stumbling aimlessly through the darkness cast upon
     your world by the trappings of the past.

  ANNOTATION
     As he speaks a soldier pours a flammable liquid
     onto the pile of books.

  PRIOR
     But now, the path to fulfillment stands revealed,
     and the time has come to embrace a new faith.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 cover their faces, uncomfortable. A soldier
     puts his torch to the pile of books, and it slowly
     catches fire.

  PRIOR
     Let the light of Origin show you the way!

  ANNOTATION
     The fire grows rapidly. SG-1 looks on worriedly.


LOCATION--VILLAGE TAVERN, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The barkeep leads SG-1 into the room. They pull
     the cloaks off of their heads. The barkeep locks
     the door.

  BARKEEP
     You have encountered them before.

  TEAL'C
     Many times, and on many different worlds.

  BARKEEP
     And how did the inhabitants of those other worlds
     resist them?

  MITCHELL
     They didn't. They either surrendered or they were
     slaughtered.

  BARKEEP
     What, are you saying there's nothing we can do?
     That we are doomed?

  CARTER
     No, no, not necessarily. We believe they can be
     defeated. That's why we're here.

  DANIEL
     We think that's why they're here as well. To
     destroy the one thing capable of stopping them.

  BARKEEP
     (nodding) The Sangreal.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a pounding on the door. The Barkeep goes
     to answer, and Mitchell stands behind the door,
     his weapon ready.

  OSRIC
     Please, I know they're here. Please!

  ANNOTATION
     The barkeep lets him in and closes the door behind
     him.

  OSRIC
     (scared and nervous) I must speak with you.
     Soldiers are looking for me.

  CARTER
     Why?

  OSRIC
     Because they believe I can lead them to the
     Sangreal.

  MITCHELL
     Can you?

  OSRIC
     Well, of course!

  DANIEL
     What? You saved the map.

  OSRIC
     No, they unwittingly burned it with the rest of
     the village archives. But, a copy still exists.

  DANIEL
     Where?

  OSRIC
     (tapping his head, smiling) Here. I will lead you
     to Merlin's treasure.

  ANNOTATION
     Soldiers pound at the door. Daniel drags Osric
     aside. The soldiers burst in. SG-1 stands around
     the edge of the room, Mitchell and Teal'c hidden
     behind the door, the barkeep in the middle.

  ORI SOLDIER
     We want the old man. It is information we seek.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c come out into the open, their
     weapons drawn. Daniel pulls out his machine gun.
     The soldier sees they are surrounded.

  MITCHELL
     Not today, fellas.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a stand-off.

  MITCHELL
     Wow, this is awkward.

  ORI SOLDIER
     Our army has taken this village. If you resist,
     there will be no escape. Now, stand aside.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c keep their weapons aimed. The
     barkeep shoots the soldier in the back with an
     arrow from a crossbow. He falls to the floor. SG-1
     all fire their machine guns at the remaining
     soldiers until they all fall.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, I think somebody must have heard that!

  ANNOTATION
     He takes off his cloak, as do the others.

  BARKEEP
     This way. Come quickly!

  ANNOTATION
     She leads them to an inside passage hidden by a
     door, which she raises. They all grab their gear
     and enter.


LOCATION--ESCAPE TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala rush through, using flashlights.


LOCATION--VILLAGE TAVERN, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c enters the tunnel, leaving only Mitchell
     and the barkeep.

  MITCHELL
     You should come with us.

  BARKEEP
     My place is here. I'll be fine. I'll blame
     everything on you.

  MITCHELL
     Good plan.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell goes into the tunnel. The barkeep closes
     the door behind him and moves a stool in front of
     it.


LOCATION--MEADOW, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Led by Osric and walking in single file, the team
     comes out of some woods and into a grassy meadow.

  OSRIC
     Ah, this way!

  ANNOTATION
     Some time later, the team is still walking.

  MITCHELL
     What the hell?

  ANNOTATION
     They have come upon a scattered group of people
     and animals frozen in place. A black bird is
     suspended in the air. All of the people are facing
     the direction the team is traveling. Some look as
     if they are about to fight. A woman has a hand
     over her mouth, perhaps the mother Osric spoke of.
     Carter pulls out a hand-held sensor and turns it
     on. They slowly approach the frozen people.

  MITCHELL
     What's the matter with them?

  CARTER
     I don't know. I'm picking up varying anomalous
     readings. (walking parallel to the line of people)
     Stronger here... weaker here.. then rising again.
     Well, this is weird. They're temporal
     fluctuations.

  MITCHELL
     Meaning?

  CARTER
     Meaning these people are trapped in a time
     distortion field.

  VALA
     Are you sure? If it's a time distortion field, why
     are the leaves moving in the trees?

  CARTER
     It could be an illusion designed to reproduce the
     standing weather pattern. These readings indicate
     the time within the field is extremely
     decelerated. I mean, these people may look like
     they're standing perfectly still, but in fact
     they're moving imperceptibly slowly.

  TEAL'C
     Are they aware of what is happening to them?

  CARTER
     Doubtful. Several years may pass on our side of
     the field in the one or two seconds it takes them
     to take even one step.

  MITCHELL
     Well, why don't we just go around it?

  CARTER
     Well, the outer edge of the field extends as far
     as I can tell in either direction. And it has a
     slight curve to it. I mean, for all I know, it
     could form a complete circle. We could walk for
     miles and never find a way through.

  MITCHELL
     Sam, if you've got another idea, I'd love to hear
     it.

  CARTER
     Well, I'm definitely picking up varied readings.
     It's almost as if...

  ANNOTATION
     She studies the readout, and Mitchell looks over
     her shoulder.

  CARTER
     I think I may have found a way in. There's a
     circuitous path of real-time winding through the
     temporal field.

  MITCHELL
     It's a maze.

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  MITCHELL
     (to the others) It's a maze.

  CARTER
     These readings are unmistakable. I can use them to
     guide us through. (to everyone) Follow my lead. If
     you stray off the path, you could wind up trapped
     in the distortion field.

  ANNOTATION
     They form a single-file line behind Carter. She
     uses the sensor to pick a path into the field. She
     signals them to stop, then turns left, and they
     follow. After some time, she is consulting the
     sensor display, and it blinks out.

  CARTER
     Uh oh.

  VALA
     What do you mean, "uh oh"?

  MITCHELL
     Uh oh, you left your stove on, right?

  CARTER
     Temporal distortions are affecting these readings.
     We're blind.

  MITCHELL
     Okay, here's a stupid question. You did check the
     batteries in that thing before we left Stargate
     Command, right?

  CARTER
     It's not the batteries.

  VALA
     We could retrace our steps and try our luck with
     the Ori soldiers.

  CARTER
     Do you know the way back?

  VALA
     (vaguely) That way.

  CARTER
     We have to be exact. Any deviation from the path
     of real time and we could end up frozen like the
     rest of these people.

  TEAL'C
     If Morgan Le Fay left clues as to the whereabouts
     of the Sangreal, then it is safe to assume that
     she believed that someone would eventually reach
     it. It also stands to reason that our task, though
     challenging, is far from impossible.

  DANIEL
     Teal'c's right. She set this trap to weed out
     those she deemed unworthy. There is a way out. We
     just have to be resourceful and carefully think it
     through.

  VALA
     Well, Arthur and his knights wouldn't have had
     access to this advanced technology to guide them
     through. So, presumably, the answer could be
     deceptively simple.

  ANNOTATION
     They all consider Vala's words. Carter puts away
     her instrument and bends down to pick up a rock
     from the sandy ground. She tosses the rock in
     front of her, and it stops in mid-air with a flash
     as it hits the field a few feet away.

  CARTER
     Follow me.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks toward the rock. She picks up another
     one and throws it to her left. It hits the field
     and stops very near to her.

  CARTER
     Dead end.

  ANNOTATION
     She throws another rock to the right. It falls to
     the ground normally, several yards away.

  CARTER
     You're right. Deceptively simple.

  ANNOTATION
     They move off in that direction, traveling quite a
     few steps. Carter throws another rock, and they
     move forward again. She throws another, which
     bursts through the field to the other side. She
     follows it through to safety.

  CARTER
     All right, we're through. We'd better pick up the
     pace if we want to cut into Ba'al's lead.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves out. Vala catches up and pats her on
     the shoulder, and she smiles at Vala.


LOCATION--WOODS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The team walks through a wooded area with a lot of
     ground vegetation.

  OSRIC
     You say that these Ori are possessed of god-like
     abilities, and yet they are not gods?

  DANIEL
     No, they're very powerful beings who would have
     their followers believe as much because faith is
     the source of their power.

  OSRIC
     Faith is something that cannot be won through
     intimidation and fear. If their followers have
     faith, then they must truly believe.

  DANIEL
     No, they only believe because they've been
     mislead. See, to many less developed
     civilizations, certain advanced technologies would
     strike them as supernatural in nature. (responding
     to Osric's scoffing grunts) Merlin wasn't a
     wizard, and Morgan Le Fay was not a sorceress.

  OSRIC
     Uh, ridiculous!

  DANIEL
     They simply used their advanced abilities to
     fashion seemingly magical creations, like the
     Sangreal or that time dilation field we
     encountered.

  OSRIC
     So you would have me believe that you are
     possessed of a complete understanding of these
     amazing feats?

  DANIEL
     No, but just because I don't know how the trick is
     done doesn't make it magic.

  ANNOTATION
     They stop at the top of a small hill. Osric rests
     a hand against a tree, as if tired.

  OSRIC
     And I would argue that your inability to
     comprehend such feats does in fact prove their
     supernatural nature.

  MITCHELL
     Their army just ran roughshod over your village,
     forced you into hiding. Now you're defending 'em.

  OSRIC
     Hardly! I condemn the actions of their soldiers,
     but am in no position to judge the Ori or their
     message. Not yet. Truth is elusive to those who
     refuse to see with both eyes.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at him in shock.

  DANIEL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stares at him. They hear a voice muttering
     in the distance. Teal'c, Mitchell and Carter look
     toward it. Teal'c moves off, and everyone follows.
     Osric tightens his cloak, looking slightly
     annoyed.


LOCATION--CLEARING IN WOODS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The team and Osric come upon Ba'al sitting on the
     ground, a small wooden chest behind him. He is
     muttering to himself.

  BA'AL
     Uh, I can't believe they abandoned me. They're
     gonna pay. All of them are going to pay.

  ANNOTATION
     Hearing them approach, Ba'al stands up and holds
     up his hand.

  BA'AL
     Wait!

  ANNOTATION
     He doesn't speak in time, and the others walk
     toward him. The yellow flash of a force field
     moves upward behind them in a dome-like shape.
     Ba'al sighs.

  BA'AL
     Well, make yourselves comfortable. We're gonna be
     here a while.

  ANNOTATION
     The team looks around at the situation. Mitchell
     walks to the edge of the clearing and scrapes his
     rifle against the force field, which flashes.

  BA'AL
     Won't do you any good. Believe me, I've tried.
     It's a one-way door.

  CARTER
     How long have you been trapped in here?

  BA'AL
     Three agonizingly tedious days. Which reminds me,
     I don't suppose you have any food?

  VALA
     (pointing at chest) What's that?

  BA'AL
     That's bait. When I approached to investigate, I
     unwittingly triggered the trap.

  CARTER
     You've had the Ancient database for months. Why
     did it take you so long to get here?

  BA'AL
     I can't think clearly on an empty stomach.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pulls a powerbar from her front vest
     pocket. She tosses it. Ba'al thinks it is coming
     to him, but it goes over his hand and Mitchell
     catches it. Mitchell sniffs at the bar teasingly.

  BA'AL
     (laughing, defeated) I only possessed two of the
     three addresses needed to complete the puzzle. As
     a result, I had significantly more possibilities
     to investigate.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell tears the bar's wrapping open and looks
     questioningly at Carter.

  BA'AL
     By a process of elimination, I was left with one
     prospect, and when I went in search of the planet,
     it wasn't there.

  CARTER
     What do you mean, it wasn't there?

  BA'AL
     It wasn't where it was supposed to be! I
     calculated its position, I sent my ships to its
     approximate position, but they couldn't find it.
     In the end my only recourse was to access it via
     the Stargate, and secure the device with a handful
     of my Jaffa. And when I became trapped in here,
     they set off in search of a means of freeing me.
     They have yet to return.

  ANNOTATION
     As he speaks, Daniel and Vala open the treasure
     chest and find it empty. Ba'al looks at the
     powerbar in Mitchell's hands. Mitchell gestures to
     Carter, then tosses the bar to Ba'al, who
     immediately begins eating it.

  MITCHELL
     Something must have come up.

  TEAL'C
     Obviously Morgan must have rendered this planet
     inaccessible to the ships, to ensure that enemies
     such as the Ori could not destroy the Sangreal
     from orbit.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel moves his hand inside the chest. It is
     empty.

  BA'AL
     (to Daniel and Vala) You're wasting your time.
     I've had three days to search for a way out of
     here. There's nothing inside.

  DANIEL
     Well, that's the point, isn't it. The Parchment of
     Virtues told us that we'd have to rely on five
     things in order to reach the Sangreal. (counting
     off on his fingers) Prudence, wisdom, charity,
     kindness, and faith.

  VALA
     You're saying the parchment was intended to be
     interpreted literally.

  DANIEL
     Why not? We were able to make our way through the
     time dilation field by patiently and carefully
     negotiating the maze. In other words, we
     demonstrated prudence as opposed to recklessness,
     which would have stranded us. So ask yourselves,
     what does this trap exploit?

  BA'AL
     Curiosity.

  DANIEL
     Greed. A person approaches a chest expecting to
     find treasure inside but instead finds nothing and
     gets trapped for his trouble.

  VALA
     So in order to reverse the trap, you have to
     reverse the impetus.

  DANIEL
     Right. The opposite of greed is charity, one of
     the virtues mentioned in the parchment.

  TEAL'C
     Instead of taking something, something must be
     sacrificed.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pulls a pen from his pocket and puts it
     into the chest. Vala closes the chest. They all
     look around for the force field to drop, but
     nothing happens. Mitchell again scrapes his gun
     against the field; it is still there.

  BA'AL
     (laughing) Well, that was an interesting theory.

  DANIEL
     Well, we're all trapped, so we all have to
     contribute something.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al chews the powerbar but doesn't move to
     comply. Mitchell pulls his hat out of his vest and
     tosses it into the chest. Carter hands a small
     device, perhaps a voice recorder to Daniel, who
     places it inside. Osric removes a ring from his
     right index finger and sets in the chest himself.
     Daniel looks at it, then up at Osric, questioning.
     Teal'c tosses something small to Daniel, who
     places it inside. Vala struggles trying to pull
     something from her pack. It is a large blow dryer.

  VALA
     No...

  ANNOTATION
     Exasperated, Daniel grabs it from her.

  VALA
     Wait!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel puts the blow dryer in the chest, then
     looks at Ba'al and clears his throat expectantly.

  BA'AL
     I have nothing to donate.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell aims his weapon at Ba'al. Teal'c
     approaches and grabs Ba'al's arms, pulling them
     behind Ba'al's body. Mitchell lowers his weapon
     and starts to search Ba'al. He moves down his body
     and finds a dagger in a sheath in Ba'al's left
     boot. He pulls it out and holds it up in front of
     Ba'al.

  BA'AL
     That particular item holds great sentimental
     value.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell hands the dagger to Daniel, who places it
     in the chest. He looks around, then closes the
     lid. After a moment, the force field lowers. They
     begin to move immediately.

  BA'AL
     Well done. Another day in there, I would have gone
     mad.

  MITCHELL
     (pointing weapon at Ba'al) Guess that makes it
     time to say goodbye.

  BA'AL
     It would be foolish of you to kill me.

  TEAL'C
     How so?

  BA'AL
     Amongst the information I obtained regarding the
     Sangreal is the name of the protector.

  VALA
     (to Daniel) Protector.

  BA'AL
     The dragon.

  OSRIC
     You see, I told you there was a dragon.

  CARTER
     I'm sure there's something guarding the device.
     Maybe it's a hologram.

  MITCHELL
     Holograms can be dangerous, you know?

  DANIEL
     It could be a ship. Flies, breathes fire, has
     armored skin. It's a mistake a mediaeval
     storyteller could easily make.

  BA'AL
     Then if it's based on technology, the name is no
     doubt a password or a command code. And either way
     if you want it, you'll have to take me with you.

  ANNOTATION
     They consider his words.

  MITCHELL
     (quietly, to his team) You know I hate to say
     this, but he could prove useful.

  ANNOTATION
     They look unhappy but don't disagree. Mitchell
     starts off, and they all follow, Ba'al waiting
     until they have passed.

  MITCHELL
     Come on!


LOCATION--WOODS, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The groups walks through the woods. Ba'al walks
     beside Daniel.

  BA'AL
     Yet again we find ourselves the unlikeliest of
     allies, joined together in common purpose.

  DANIEL
     You know, the word "allies" implies some sort of
     partnership, and that just isn't the case here.
     You see, we are going after the Sangreal, while
     you are tagging along for the ride.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al laughs. They arrive at a grassy clearing.
     Osric points ahead.

  OSRIC
     According to the map, the Sangreal is hidden in a
     cave beneath a lone mountain.

  ANNOTATION
     In the near distance, perhaps two miles away, is a
     large grey mountain standing alone. It is
     cone-shaped as if it were volcanic. Mitchell
     doesn't stop but just keeps walking.

  MITCHELL
     Right, we're getting warm.

  ANNOTATION
     They all follow him.


LOCATION--OUTSIDE CAVE ENTRANCE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at an entrance area protected by rocks
     and surrounded by foliage. Osric walks up to the
     entrance excitedly. Ba'al stands next to him.

  OSRIC
     This is it! The cave entrance. The Sangreal is
     located within.

  MITCHELL
     (raising his weapon) It's too bad you won't be
     coming with us.

  BA'AL
     (thinking Mitchell is speaking to him) I thought I
     made it clear -- you need me.

  MITCHELL
     I wasn't talking to you.

  BA'AL
     Ah, well, uh, allow me to get out of your line of
     fire.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al steps away, leaving Osric alone, looking
     shocked.

  OSRIC
     Have you lost your senses?

  DANIEL
     "Truth eludes he who does not seek it with both
     eyes wide." That's a quote from the Book of
     Origin. You paraphrased it earlier today. Now I
     might not have noticed, but I spent the past year
     studying the good book, so...

  OSRIC
     Surely you're not basing your suspicions on this
     mere coincidence?

  DANIEL
     And when it came time to give up a possession to
     free ourselves from the forcefield trap, I noticed
     the designs on your ring. Not Celtic as one might
     expect given the cultural background of this
     planet, but distinctly Ori.

  OSRIC
     (becoming angry) The ring was a gift from a
     traveling merchant. You're making a mistake!

  MITCHELL
     You're the one who screwed up, now drop the act!

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at them all, and they look back at him,
     completely skeptical. His demeanor becomes more
     relaxed and knowing.

  OSRIC
     It would have been so much easier if you had
     remained oblivious. But now things will be much
     more difficult.

  ANNOTATION
     He quickly transforms into Adria, wearing black
     leather and her protective necklace. SG-1 all
     raise their weapons at her.

  ADRIA
     (to Daniel, evilly) Especially for you.

  MITCHELL
     (noticing her eyes are a normal brown color)
     You've done something new with your eyes.

  ANNOTATION
     Adria's eyes flash orange then return to brown.

  MITCHELL
     So, the troops in the village, the shootout in the
     tavern, that was all a set-up.

  ADRIA
     More than you know. I grew impatient waiting for
     you to discover the location of the weapon. So, I
     gave you a little help.

  VALA
     The dream I had -- three into one. That was you.

  ADRIA
     Yes.

  CARTER
     So you planted the solution in Vala, knowing it
     would lead us right to you.

  ADRIA
     Apparently Morgan put safeguards in place to
     ensure the weapon could only be secured by, what
     was the term again? "Those possessing truth of
     spirit." I can't think of anyone more appropriate
     than a former Ascended. (to Daniel) With your
     help, I'll secure the device.

  MITCHELL
     Hate to disappoint.

  ANNOTATION
     She begins to move, and Mitchell fires his
     automatic weapon at her. Her shield protects her
     from any harm. Mitchell stops firing.

  ADRIA
     (to Mitchell) You've seen a demonstration of my
     powers. You know what I'm capable of. So I'm
     offering you a choice. Either we work together to
     reach the device, or I'll start killing off
     members of your team. (she looks toward Carter)
     Starting with her.

  DANIEL
     All right! We'll work together. For now.

  ANNOTATION
     Adria smiles in victory.


LOCATION--TUNNEL IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     The cave has man-made steps carved into the floor,
     which the group descends. It is dark, forcing the
     team to use flashlights. Vala and Adria walk
     beside each other.

  ADRIA
     We thwarted all efforts against us. Crippled your
     fleet. Met with little if any resistance on the
     worlds that we redeemed. Opposition to the Ori is
     clearly hopeless, but you continue to struggle
     against the inevitable.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, well, what can I tell you. We're optimists.

  ADRIA
     Your only hope lies with Merlin's weapon. Once I
     take that away from you, your defeat will be
     complete.

  VALA
     Ha ha. Now look who's the optimist.

  ADRIA
     You disappoint me, mother. I would have expected
     you to see reason by now. But it doesn't matter.
     Eventually you'll have no choice but to accept the
     truth. And when you do, (touching Vala on the arm)
     I'll accompany you on your path to enlightenment.

  ANNOTATION
     Adria walks ahead. Vala points her gun at Adria's
     back and wiggles it in frustration.

  ANNOTATION
     Behind the others, Carter and Mitchell walk
     together.

  MITCHELL
     You know the second we find that thing, she's
     gonna kill us.

  CARTER
     Not if we kill her first.

  MITCHELL
     That could be a bit of a problem.

  CARTER
     I don't know, we're pretty resourceful, I'm sure
     we'll think of something.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, just don't want to do it too soon. She may
     not be true of spirit and all that jazz, but she
     has done her homework. I hate to say it, but...

  CARTER
     She could prove useful.

  MITCHELL
     For the moment.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at a more open chamber. With their
     flashlights they see a stone panel set into the
     cave wall with Ancient writing on it. Daniel
     approaches it.

  DANIEL
     (translating) Choose the way that is just and
     true.

  VALA
     Ooh, it's a riddle! I'm good at these. Umm... the
     way that is just and true... just and true...

  ANNOTATION
     She faces toward the cave tunnel to their right.

  VALA
     (smiling) It's telling us to go that way! The way
     that is just and true. That is, the right way!

  ANNOTATION
     She starts to head down that tunnel, but Daniel
     grabs her arm and drags her back.

  VALA
     Wha? Ow!

  DANIEL
     The writing's in Ancient.

  VALA
     So?

  DANIEL
     So in Ancient, the word meaning just and true is
     very different from the word meaning right, as in
     opposite of left.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter hears a sound from the tunnel to the left.
     Teal'c hears it too.

  CARTER
     Did you hear that?

  ANNOTATION
     They all hear it. It sounds like a child crying.

  TEAL'C
     It sounds like a child. (starting to head off)
     This way.

  ANNOTATION
     The others follow, except for Daniel, Vala, and
     Ba'al.

  VALA
     A child in here... It's obviously a trap.

  DANIEL
     Or quite possibly a test.

  ANNOTATION
     He sets off.

  BA'AL
     A test of what? Our stupidity?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala laughs nervously. They follow the others.


LOCATION--CHAMBER IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     They come upon a boy, perhaps five years old.
     Seeing them, he cries in fright and ducks behind
     some rocks to another tunnel.

  MITCHELL
     Hey kid! Kid, wait up.

  ANNOTATION
     They follow him into the tunnel.


LOCATION--DESCENDING PATH IN CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell leads them down the stone staircase.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, slow down, little guy!

  ADRIA
     We're walking right into a trap.

  DANIEL
     No, we're not. The parchment provided us with
     clues to reaching the Sangreal. It mentioned
     kindness as one of the virtues that would guide
     us. So if we show kindness by helping this child
     it should bring us one step closer to the device.

  ADRIA
     The parchment also mentioned wisdom, which we
     would be demonstrating by avoiding this trap.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear a loud clanking noise. It is the sound
     of an iron gate dropping by metal chains to the
     floor. It forms a cell door, or portcullis,
     trapping the boy in the cave behind it. The boy
     sits on the floor, very frightened and crying.

  MITCHELL
     Hang on, kid. We'll get you out of there.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell tries to lift the gate by hand. Teal'c
     and Carter help.

  MITCHELL
     Little help, here!

  ANNOTATION
     Vala and Daniel join. They all pull as hard as
     they can, but the gate does not move.

  BA'AL
     He's tiny. Tell him to squeeze through the bars.

  TEAL'C
     (turning to him) Assist us, or I will squeeze you
     through these bars.

  ANNOTATION
     Ba'al moves forward.

  DANIEL
     (to Adria) You wanna use your powers to lift it?

  ADRIA
     We're wasting our time. Let's go back.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala gives her an admonishing look. She huffs and
     steps forward to grab the gate. Now all of them
     are touching it. It begins to lift immediately.
     The boy smiles at them, then disappears. The false
     back of the cave also disappears, revealing
     another tunnel.

  MITCHELL
     Well, how about that. We did pick the right way.

  ANNOTATION
     They travel for a bit, but come to an apparent end
     of the tunnel.

  MITCHELL
     It's a dead end.

  ADRIA
     We have to go back.

  CARTER
     No, it doesn't make any sense that we would have
     progressed this far only to come up empty.

  ANNOTATION
     She finds another stone panel with Ancient
     writing.

  CARTER
     Daniel?

  DANIEL
     It's another riddle.

  VALA
     Oh, goody!

  ANNOTATION
     She nearly bowls Mitchell over getting to Daniel's
     side.

  DANIEL
     (translating) I'm struck and cut, shaped and
     cooled, then bound by rings to release what's
     stored.

  ANNOTATION
     The cave begins to rumble and shake around them,
     bits of dust dropping.

  MITCHELL
     You might want to pick things up a little bit,
     here.

  VALA
     All right, well we have to think it through.
     What's struck and cut, and shaped and cooled, and
     then bound by rings.

  ANNOTATION
     The rumbling worsens.

  VALA
     (shouting) Bound by rings!

  MITCHELL
     Key! The answer is key.

  DANIEL
     (toward the riddle panel) Ah, Clavia!

  ANNOTATION
     The panel wall melts away, revealing another
     tunnel. They rush into it.


LOCATION--CAVE TUNNEL

  ANNOTATION
     The rumbling continues and worsens. They rush
     through the tunnels and find another panel.

  DANIEL
     (translating) I shake the earth with booming
     thunder, fell forests whole and homes complete! I
     influence ships, topple kings, sweep down swift
     yet remain unseen!

  VALA
     Oh wait, I've got this. Uh, it's suggesting a
     strong yet invisible force... Uh...

  TEAL'C
     Wind.

  DANIEL
     Ventio!

  ANNOTATION
     The panel dissolves, and they rush through into
     another tunnel and up a set of stairs. The
     rumbling has not abated. They come to a new panel.

  MITCHELL
     Ah, for crying out loud!

  DANIEL
     (translating) Battle-scarred in times of strife.
     Resistant to... resistant to...

  VALA
     To what?

  DANIEL
     Uh, I don't know. I-- I can't translate this
     section of the text.

  VALA
     Nevertheless, battle-scarred would suggest...

  ADRIA
     Contagia!

  ANNOTATION
     The panel disappears. The rumbling stops.

  MITCHELL
     Looks like that's done it.

  VALA
     You know, come to think of it, riddles never were
     my strong point.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the new tunnel.

  VALA
     Visual puzzles, like "which of these symbols does
     not belong with the others," or "reconfigure the
     tiles to make the hidden picture."

  MITCHELL
     Is it just me, or is it getting hot in here?

  VALA
     Oh, now that you mention it.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at at chamber at the end of the
     tunnel. There is a wall of fire burning in the
     doorway in front of them, blocking their path.

  VALA
     It is a tad toasty.


LOCATION--CHAMBER NEAR WALL OF FIRE

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Daniel search the room for some clue
     or device to stop the fire.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, you got anything?

  DANIEL
     No, you?

  MITCHELL
     No, but I'm gettin' a good tan. Let's take a
     break.

  DANIEL
     (agreeable) Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk back to where Ba'al and Adria are
     waiting.

  MITCHELL
     There are no hidden triggers or secret passages.
     If there's a way through, we didn't find it.

  ADRIA
     Then I suppose we should head back.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Vala enter from the other direction.

  CARTER
     Not an option. The passageways have resealed
     behind us.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala sighs in frustration.

  ADRIA
     Then I was right. We walked into a trap.

  DANIEL
     No. We made all the right choices to lead us to
     this point. I know the Sangreal lies beyond that
     wall of fire. We just have to find a way through.

  BA'AL
     (to Adria) Why don't you do something? You're the
     Orici. You're supposedly possessed of significant
     powers. So snuff out the flame and get us on our
     way.

  ADRIA
     My abilities don't work that way.

  BA'AL
     (laughing dismissively) Of course, how does the
     saying go? "All flash, no photo?"

  CARTER
     Actually, it's "All flash, no substance."

  BA'AL
     I prefer my version.

  ADRIA
     Would you care for a demonstration?

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at her in a challenging way. She stares
     at him for a moment, then turns her back on him,
     appearing to back away from a confrontation.

  ADRIA
     Taking your life would be a waste of my time.

  BA'AL
     Which I suppose would be put to better use
     complaining.

  CARTER
     Oh, geez, why don't you two just get a room?!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks away, annoyed.

  DANIEL
     It's the only one left.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps toward the room with the wall of flame.

  CARTER
     Daniel?

  ANNOTATION
     He steps nearer the fire. The others gather behind
     him.

  DANIEL
     The parchment told us that five virtues would
     guide us in our quest for the Sangreal. Prudence,
     kindness, charity, wisdom, and faith. Now we
     displayed prudence in finding a way out of the
     temporal maze, charity in escaping the forcefield
     trap, kindness by helping the child and finding
     the hidden passageway, and wisdom in solving the
     riddles. The only virtue left is faith.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pauses for a moment, blinks, then steps
     toward the fire.

  MITCHELL
     Jackson!

  CARTER
     Daniel!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel steps through the flame. It immediately
     dissipates, revealing Daniel unharmed on the other
     side, in a large tunnel. The others begin to
     follow, Vala and Teal'c at the rear.

  VALA
     Well, after you, muscles.

  ANNOTATION
     They join the others.


LOCATION--CAVERN OF THE SANGREAL

  ANNOTATION
     Led by Daniel, they arrive at a huge cavern. There
     is a narrow walkway over an open abyss, which
     leads to a wider platform with two stone
     structures on it. On the lower pedestal of the
     platform is a glowing red object.

  BA'AL
     There it is. We found it. Ours for the taking.

  MITCHELL
     Hang on.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell tosses a rock over the edge into the
     abyss. There is no sound of it hitting anything.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, it's pretty deep.

  ANNOTATION
     They look at the footbridge to the Sangreal on its
     dais.

  DANIEL
     I'll go.

  ADRIA
     We'll both go.

  BA'AL
     I think I'll stay here and support you from a
     distance.

  MITCHELL
     We should all go.

  ADRIA
     (threatening) No. Only Daniel and I will go. The
     rest of you will stay.

  DANIEL
     (to Mitchell) It's all right.

  ANNOTATION
     Holding up his weapon with its flashlight on,
     Daniel takes the first steps onto the bridge.
     Adria follows. Mitchell, Carter and Teal'c look on
     worriedly. They arrive at the platform. There is a
     tall stone with diamond-shaped blue stones on it,
     surrounded by Ancient writing. Beside it is the
     lower dais with the red glowing Sangreal resting
     on it. Daniel shines his flashlight on it.

  ADRIA
     Take it.

  DANIEL
     After you.

  ADRIA
     I told you. Morgan put safeguards in place to
     ensure that someone such as myself couldn't claim
     the device.

  DANIEL
     (realizing, challenging) Is that why you didn't
     just use your powers from back there?

  ADRIA
     What are you talking about?

  DANIEL
     Well, you have telekinetic abilities. I've seen
     you use them. You should have just snatched the
     Sangreal off the dais without taking a step, but
     you didn't. Probably for the same reason you
     didn't use your powers to lift the portcullis or
     kill Ba'al the second he stepped out of line. You
     can't!

  ADRIA
     (nervously) Of course I can.

  DANIEL
     No. My guess is Morgan did put safeguards in place
     and that those safeguards are neutralizing your
     Ori-given powers.

  ADRIA
     You saw me withstand the bullets fired against me.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, thanks to your personal shield. The only
     powers you can manifest originate from that
     pendant and they're purely defensive in nature.

  ADRIA
     (almost sultry) Do you really want to test me?

  DANIEL
     (after a moment) Yep.

  ANNOTATION
     Adria is shocked. Daniel points his flashlight on
     her face and takes a ready stance.

  DANIEL
     You know what? I changed my mind about helping
     you. Knock yourself out.

  ANNOTATION
     Adria looks at him nervously and does nothing.

  MITCHELL
     (calling to them) What's the hold-up?

  DANIEL
     Thought so.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps forward to take the Sangreal. His hand
     passes right through it, and it blinks, as if it
     is a hologram. Daniel is surprised for a moment.

  DANIEL
     Well, I guess I'm not as true of spirit as you
     thought I was.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a sound of mechanisms moving, and dust
     starts to fall from the cave wall behind the team.

  MITCHELL
     Jackson, move it!

  ANNOTATION
     Adria rushes back along the bridge, followed by
     Daniel. They try to leave, but the way out is now
     closed. They look around in confusion. They hear a
     sound.

  MITCHELL
     What the hell is that?

  ANNOTATION
     There is a sound of large wings flapping.

  VALA
     We agreed there's no such thing as a dragon,
     right?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  VALA
     Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     A large dragon arrives by flight and hovers above
     them. It has wings and legs but no forelegs. It
     hisses at them.

  VALA
     'Cause that looks pretty real to me.

  ANNOTATION
     It breathes a ball of fire at them.
