Why don't we talk about vaginas? Why are work and kids and holiday plans more acceptable topics of conversation than our own vaginas? And I didn't have an answer. So, I took it upon myself to find out. I started to talk about vaginas at work, at home, sometimes even in fancy restaurants! Soon my friends started to talk about vaginas as well. And it was only a matter of time before it became a hot conversation topic. No matter where I went, it was "vagina this", "vagina that," "vagina, vagina, vagina..."</td></tr>

He turns to other side of him and finds the young woman with spiked hair and a nose ring who gives a challenging nod. Teal'c tries to sink into his chair in the female filled audience, covering his face in his hands in embarrassment.</td></tr>
