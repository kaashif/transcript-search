<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Sol's is a typical small-town-America diner on the corner of two streets. A few pedestrians pass by on the sidewalk, and a man comes out the front door to talk on his cell phone.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--SOL'S DINER</td></tr>
<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The diner is busy, and it seems to be lunchtime. A couple with two young boys sit at a table in the middle of the room. The kids are playing with hand-held electronic games. The father looks up as their waitress approaches. It is Vala, dressed in a green and yellow uniform with an apron, and she's wearing matching eye-shadow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>VALA: Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner. I'm Val. (she moves her hair to reveal her nametag) I'll be your waitress today. Have you had a chance to look over the menu? Might I suggest the meatball sandwich? It's the owner's personal favorite.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala gestures toward the kitchen where the owner, Sal, is plating up the food and rings to bell to indicate an order is ready. He smiles and waves, then goes back to his grill.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>MOTHER: Sounds good.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala nods and writes it on her order pad.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>VALA: (to father) Sir?</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>FATHER: Uh, two junior meals for the kids... and I'll have the club sandwich.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>VALA: (still writing) Okay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>FATHER: Oh, and can I get some extra pickles on that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Two shady-looking men are checking out the diner through one of the windows. They look at each other and nod before heading toward the entrance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>VALA: (cheerily) No problem.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>FATHER: Thank you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>VALA: Waters all 'round?</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>VALA: Okay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>MOTHER: (to boys) Okay, once the food comes that's it for the games.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The shady men come in the front door; the taller one pulls a gun from the back of his waistband.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>GUY #1: (shouting) All right, wallets and purses on the tables in front of you, now!</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He pulls a plastic grocery bag out of his pocket and holds it out towards Vala. She looks over her shoulder at him, uncertain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>GUY #1: Valuables in here. (pointing gun at Vala) Hey, you listenin' to me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala backs up until she's facing him, glancing between the bag and the gun that is now pointed straight at her chest. Suddenly, she grabs his right hand and pushes it aside, then forces the arm back and twists his wrist which makes him loosen his grip on the gun. Vala spins around behind him, pulling his gun hand over his shoulder, and elbows him in the kidney. A blow to the base of his neck keeps him stunned long enough for her to get in a kick to the groin of the other robber who was trying to come at her from behind. When Guy #2 doubles over in pain, she knees him in the face and shoves him away. He lands on the nearest table, which breaks and dumps him to the floor. Vala grabs a napkin dispenser off the counter and whacks Guy #1 on the back of the head. He crumples to the floor, unconscious. Vala spins the revolver into her own hand, gunslinger style, and points it at him, just in case. A single saucer spins on the tile floor as Sal rushes out of the kitchen wielding a meat mallet. The diner's patrons look on in shock.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>SAL: (softly) What did you do?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--IL FIORE BIANCO RESTAURANT</td></tr>
<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The restaurant's ambiance is very upscale Italian. Small tables are covered in long white tablecloths and everything is lit by candles and twinkle lights. The hostess seats Vala and Daniel at a table with a single white rose in a vase.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel and Vala begin to look over their choices on the fancy menu. Vala takes a moment to admire the decor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>VALA: (appreciatively) Fancy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, I know you don't get off the base much except for official business, so I thought I'd take you somewhere nice.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel takes his napkin out of his glass and places it in his lap, then pushes the tall vase to the side of the table out of the way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>VALA: Well, I don't mind telling you, I've been looking forward to this little date all week.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>DANIEL: I wouldn't exactly call it a 'date'. It's--</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>VALA: Oh, I've watched enough of your television to know what a date is, Daniel. It's a romantic event typified by dinner, movie and/or karaoke and, usually, culminating in a night of...</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She shoots him a flirty, knowing look.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>DANIEL: (flustered) O-okay, this is... this is definitely not a date. It's, it's two friends and coworkers out for dinner.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>VALA: Oh. Well, I--</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She's cut off by the arrival of their waiter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>WAITER: Hi.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>VALA: (to waiter) Hi.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>WAITER: Well, tonight's featured martinis are the chocolate, passion fruit, and shochu plum.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>VALA: They all sound wonderful. So... one of each, then?</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>DANIEL: (jumping in) Yeah, I-- I think we're gonna pace ourselves. She'll do the... passion fruit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala gives a playful growl.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>DANIEL: And, um, I'm gonna have the bottled water.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>WAITER: Sure.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The waiter glances between them, amused, as he walks away. Vala and Daniel start talking at the same time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>VALA: Uh...</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>DANIEL: Listen...</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>VALA: Okay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>DANIEL: Um... Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you adjusting to your new life here, learning to trust other people and, most importantly, refusing the temptation to fall back on your old ways. But you have worked hard to make a place for yourself with us and-- and dinner tonight is my way of saying thank you. Thank you for... for proving me right when I said we could take a chance on you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala is a pleased and a little embarrassed at the praise. She smiles and ducks her head.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>VALA: I don't know what to say.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>DANIEL: (shakes his head) Just say what you were gonna say before I interrupted.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>VALA: Okay. I need to use the bathroom.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel deflates a bit at her response.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>VALA: Okay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She gets up and heads toward the restrooms, giving him a playful poke in the cheek as she passes. Daniel laughs quietly, sighs, and clears his throat as he resumes looking over the menu. Meanwhile, Vala strides down the hallway toward the ladies' room. As she walks past a man at a payphone, he hangs up, spins around behind her and jams a syringe into her neck. She immediately groans and goes a bit limp. He pulls her arm around his neck and quickly starts walking her toward the front door.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>KIDNAPPER: (to waiter) She, uh, needs some fresh air.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The waiter looks concerned, but goes about his business. He returns to Daniel's table and sets down their drinks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>WAITER: Your friend has taken ill.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>DANIEL: (lifting his gaze, very concerned) What? Where is she?</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>WAITER: Um... she was escorted outside by another gentleman.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel quickly drops his menu and napkin onto the table and heads for the door.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--IL FIORE BIANCO, NIGHT</td></tr>
<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The kidnapper and his cohort manhandle a drugged Vala into the back of a large white sedan driven by a third man. They burn rubber out of the driveway just as Daniel comes racing out the door. He finds the flower Vala had been wearing in her hair lying on the ground and picks it up, clearly upset.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE</td></tr>
<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala is strapped to a gurney with leather restraints. She awakens groggily and pulls at her left wrist. As she looks down, she notices a large Band-Aid on her upper arm. A blonde woman in a business suit steps toward her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ATHENA: I apologize for that. The surgery was performed in a moving car. They were more concerned about removing the subcutaneous transmitter than being gentle about it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala looks around the room, getting her bearings. There are two men, an operative and Weaver, standing in front of an array of computers and other devices, but little else.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>VALA: (to Athena) Do I know you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ATHENA: You did. A long time ago. (her eyes flash gold -- she is a Goa'uld) Qetesh, the Goa'uld that once occupied your body, was a rival of mine. She was a very intelligent adversary, which is why I eventually decided to partner with her. In retrospect, it's also the reason I should have been more careful about trusting her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>VALA: As the host to her Goa'uld, I was an unwilling participant in many of Qetesh's thoughtless actions, so if this is (laughs nervously) a revenge thing, your anger is, well, misplaced.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>ATHENA: This isn't 'a revenge thing'.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>VALA: (disheartened) Oh.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Athena nods to Weaver and he comes around the workbench to the other side of the gurney.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>ATHENA: This is a search for answers. My position in the Trust has afforded me considerable resources.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Weaver presses a Tok'ra memory device into Vala's temple.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>VALA: Ow. OW!</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>ATHENA: Ever since I heard that you joined Stargate Command, I've been watching and waiting for an opportunity... which finally presented itself tonight.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>VALA: What exactly do you want from me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>ATHENA: The code. To an Ancient tablet that I helped Qetesh locate long ago. A treasure map of sorts. She was supposed to share it with me, but instead decided to keep it for herself. From what I understand, she was never able to decipher it. I'd like that opportunity.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>VALA: (shrugging) To be honest, it doesn't ring a bell.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>ATHENA: That's because you suppressed many of the details from your time as Qetesh. The full genetic memory of the Goa'uld would drive your inferior human mind insane. Luckily, we have this device to help us find what we're looking for.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala resumes looking around the room for a means of escape. Her attention is drawn to a metallic device that is clearly not from Earth. The operative manipulates its controls.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>OPERATIVE: (to Athena) This'll take a while.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>ATHENA: I'll leave you to it, then.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She gives Vala one last nasty smile as she leaves. Vala is understandably nervous.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--SGC, LEVEL 16 CORRIDOR</td></tr>
<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Personnel go about their business. Daniel and General Landry converse as they walk purposefully through the corridors. Not much time has passed, because Daniel is still wearing his clothes from the restaurant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>LANDRY: We've got the local authorities searching the area and conducting interviews with every possible witness. So far they've come up empty.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>DANIEL: General, there's no question the Trust is behind her disappearance. I mean, they're the only ones with the resources capable of pulling something like this off.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>LANDRY: Agreed. I've already put a call through to Agent Barrett. He's got his people working on it. We'll find her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel shakes his head in frustration as they walk past the elevator and continue up the hall.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--TRUST LAB INSIDE WAREHOUSE</td></tr>
<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala moans and struggles against her bonds as images from her time as Qetesh's host play randomly in her mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>WEAVER: We're starting to get images from her suppressed memory.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Short scenes from Qetesh's life flash on the screen of a laptop: the throne room on P8X-412, a sarcophagus chamber, a fleet of death gliders passing in front of a sun. Along the left side of the screen, there are boxes of text in English and Ancient.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>WEAVER: (to Operative) Dial it down.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Vala pants and blinks rapidly as she once again becomes aware of her surroundings. Weaver walks around the workbench to her side.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>VALA: A little dizzy. A little tired. And very, very angry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L110"><td><a href="#L110">110</a></td><td>WEAVER: Oh, that's because the flashbacks you're experiencing are dredging up some long-buried emotions that may be coloring your conscious mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L111"><td><a href="#L111">111</a></td><td>VALA: I'm gonna kill both of you in the most painful way possible.</td></tr>
