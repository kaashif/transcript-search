Similar back stories and remains, another fictitious animal representation. In one of Typhon's last legends, he killed three hundred followers and then disappeared from Greece. Now at that point, he seemed to vanish from recorded history altogether. Until I found this. A new cult arose in England early 1800s, strangely enough near the location of Stonehenge. The cult had an enigmatic leader named Seth. They were constantly under attack by the Christians, then, and this is the important part, Seth's worshippers, all of them, were found dead, having slit their own throats. But Seth's body was never found.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>DANIEL: I thought so, until, on a whim, I did a search on the US Government classified net, in case the CIA had a record of...something, somewhere. And guess what came up on the ATF page? A cult whose leader is named Seth, just North of Seattle. The ATF are investigating him now because they've become so heavily armed and fortified. This guy has about fifty followers, who are all apparently ready to die for him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>DANIEL: Deprogrammed ex members of the cult describe Seth as having magical powers and the ability to heal.
