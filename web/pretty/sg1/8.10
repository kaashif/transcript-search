<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, they've been busy lately. They had Teal'c under surveillance, they blackmailed you and they tried to kill Alec Colson. Obviously, the operation is a lot bigger than we first thought. Now, as far as we know the NID has been clean for over a year. But there are still dozens of ex-agents who are unaccounted for. And they continue to receive financing from unknown sources.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>CARTER: The Prometheus has Asgard beam technology but not Asgard sensors. Which means that we can't pinpoint specific targets unless they've been tagged in advance. What if whoever did this has the same problem?</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>DANIEL: Do you think the anomaly was a locater beacon?</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>CARTER: Yeah, which Hartkins placed directly on the gate. I mean, there's no other way they could pull this off.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>O'NEILL: So my stamp collection is safe. How does that help us find the gate?</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>CARTER: Well, if they want to keep using the beam, they'll have to keep using the beacons. We could request NSA satellite time to see if we could detect the signal.</td></tr>
