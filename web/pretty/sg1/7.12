Nicaragua gets their stuff directly from Russia now, but in the eighties they inherited all the old stuff from Cuba. How do you like that? They let us fight Cuba from their shores, we got our asses kicked, and Cuba gives them the guns. You know we could get shot at by an AK-47 that was fired at the Bay of Pigs attack?</td></tr>
