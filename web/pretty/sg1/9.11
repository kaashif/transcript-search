The Fourth Horseman Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--DAKARA, DAY


LOCATION--JAFFA HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER, DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa council sit and listen to the newly
     created Prior, Gerak, as he stands in the center
     circular podium and addresses them. Teal'c has
     stepped away from his chair and stands listening
     intently.

  GERAK
     Like you, my judgment was clouded by suspicion and
     distrust. But the Ori sensed my misgivings,
     forgave me my weaknesses, and showed me their
     power. I stand before you today, as proof of their
     divine might.

  TEAL'C
     They have poisoned your mind. The Ori's promises
     are hollow. We have learned from the Ancients that
     they are not ascending their followers.

  GERAK
     Do you expect us to take your word for this?

  TEAL'C
     One of the Ancients returned to human form to warn
     us that the Ori gain strength by sapping the power
     from their followers. That is why they seek our
     support! The Ori are not some benevolent gods,
     offering you the path to enlightenment. They are
     but manipulative beings who will use you and
     discard you once you have served their purpose.

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak shakes his head in impatient dismissal.

  GERAK
     Enough.

  TEAL'C
     They are NO BETTER than the Goa'uld!

  GERAK
     Enough! The Goa'uld are impostors, but the
     Ori...the Ori are the real gods. Behold the gift
     the Ori have bestowed upon me.

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak raises his hands from his sides. Copies of
     the Book of Origin at each council member's seats
     begin to rise several inches off the table. The
     council members' eyes widen in surprise. Bra'tac
     stands up, next to Teal'c, and they exchange
     concerned looks. Gerak lowers his arms, and all
     the books fall back to the table with loud thumps.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Lam and Landry walk down a corridor. Both look
     extremely tired.

  LAM
     We've had three fatalities this morning. We have
     another twelve base personnel that are in critical
     condition and probably won't make it past the next
     twenty-four hours.

  LANDRY
     That's it?

  LAM
     They've been given sedatives and are resting
     comfortably. There's nothing you or anyone can do
     for them right now.

  LANDRY
     I can go see them.

  ANNOTATION
     Lam steps in front of Landry and turns to face
     him, stopping his progress.

  LAM
     No, you can't! You're exhausted, and you've
     already got a lot on your plate.

  LANDRY
     Those people are serving under my command.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry starts to move away from Lam. Harriman
     approaches.

  HARRIMAN
     Sir!

  LANDRY
     What is it, Walter?

  HARRIMAN
     As of 0800 this morning, the CDC reports confirmed
     cases of the virus in both Mexico and Canada.

  LAM
     We could be looking at a global pandemic.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     People move about in everyday activities. Two
     Sodan warriors practice in the competition ring.


LOCATION--PRISON HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Daniel are locked within a wooden
     hut. Bamboo bars are across the window and a guard
     can be seen posted outside the window. Mitchell
     and Daniel are eating some type of mush out of
     bowls. The door opens, and Jolan enters. Mitchell
     puts down his bowl.

  MITCHELL
     Jolan! Hey, it's good to see a familiar face.

  JOLAN
     Lord Haikon wishes to see you.

  MITCHELL
     (adjusting his cap) Let's rock and roll.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Jolan exit the hut. A small child
     stands outside the window smiling at Daniel. He
     rattles his empty bowl teasingly across the bamboo
     bars, watching the child's reaction.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY

  JOLAN
     It was foolish of you to come. The others are
     distrustful of you.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, I kinda got that. Is there anything else I
     need to know?

  JOLAN
     Haikon will have your answers.


LOCATION--HAIKON'S HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     A servant helps Haikon take off his leather armor.
     Mitchell and Jolan enter.

  HAIKON
     Welcome, Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     Thank you, Haikon.

  HAIKON
     (gesturing) Please, sit.

  ANNOTATION
     They all sit at a low Asian-style table. Haikon
     pours tea into cups with a dipper.

  HAIKON
     I apologize for making you wait, but I just came
     back from a mission of great importance.

  JOLAN
     We were informed of a world of non-believers who
     were conspiring against the Ori. The Prior
     dispatched us to "deal" with them.

  MITCHELL
     You mean kill them.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell picks up his tea.

  HAIKON
     Well, we were told they posed a considerable
     threat. "Leave not the smallest pebble, nor allow
     any hindrance that will slow your people's
     progress." So said the Prior.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, the Priors say a lot of things. Look, I'm
     the last person to criticize someone for what they
     believe, but--

  HAIKON
     If your intention is to convince me to withdraw
     support for the Ori, you need not bother.

  MITCHELL
     You're making a big--

  HAIKON
     I have already decided as much.

  MITCHELL
     What?

  JOLAN
     We went to the planet as the Prior instructed. Two
     hundred strong to eliminate any threat. We were
     expecting an army. What we found were simple
     farmers, too naive to understand the consequences
     they faced for daring to defy the Ori.

  HAIKON
     The Sodan are proud warriors. We do not kill
     innocent people.

  MITCHELL
     So, you didn't follow through.

  JOLAN
     We left them unharmed. But before returning here,
     we had to put all doubts to rest, so we traveled
     to another world, one rumored to have refused the
     Ori. The entire civilization was decimated by a
     mysterious plague. There was no one left.

  MITCHELL
     (soberly) Yeah, that's what they do. In fact
     they're doing it on Earth right now, as we speak.
     And it'll probably happen here when the Prior gets
     back and finds out you didn't obey his orders.

  HAIKON
     How can we resist so powerful an enemy?

  MITCHELL
     Well, I can tell you, but you're probably not
     going to like it.


LOCATION--SGC SCIENCE LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Orlin types on a laptop computer at a station and
     makes notes on paper next to him. He throws down
     his pencil and rubs his face with his hands.
     Carter appears at the doorway.

  CARTER
     Orlin?

  ORLIN
     Sam. Are you all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter walks into the room.

  CARTER
     I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about. We just got
     your test results back. They show significant and
     progressive changes in different areas of your
     brain.

  ORLIN
     What kind of changes?

  CARTER
     A degenerative process that's already started to
     impair your cognitive functions.

  ORLIN
     I knew that when I took on human form, the
     memories I brought with me would eventually fade.

  CARTER
     That's only part of it. I mean it's not so much a
     result of you losing the memories, but more a
     consequence of your trying to hold onto them.
     Orlin, by not letting go of the Ancient knowledge,
     you're damaging your brain.

  ORLIN
     Yes. My human mind if failing under the...weight
     of so much information.

  CARTER
     You knew this would happen, didn't you? (She
     scoffs.) As an Ancient, how could you not have
     known?

  ORLIN
     Of course I knew, Sam. But I had no choice.

  CARTER
     But you have a choice now! Your brain is fighting
     a losing battle, stripping away whatever it can in
     an attempt to salvage the memories related to the
     cure. Give them up, and you could stop this from
     progressing any further.

  ORLIN
     I can't do that. There's too much at stake.

  CARTER
     You have the memories. Write them down. Give me
     the instructions. I'll complete the vaccine.

  ORLIN
     It's too complex. You won't fully understand the
     process.

  CARTER
     Try me! Orlin, you don't have to sacrifice
     yourself! Let go, before it's too late.

  ORLIN
     I can't risk entrusting this job to anyone but
     myself. I have to see this through, Sam. I'm
     sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter fights back tears and sighs heavily before
     leaving.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell calibrates the remote to the anti-Prior
     device and buries it in the sand of the
     competition ring. Sodan warriors, Daniel, and
     SG-22 stand nearby.

  MITCHELL
     We're good.

  DANIEL
     Okay, this device will emit a high ultra-sonic
     frequency targeting a specific portion of the
     Prior's brain, temporarily blocking his ability to
     use his powers. Now, the good news is, it won't
     have any effect on us. The bad news is, it may not
     have any effect on the Prior, either.

  MITCHELL
     In order for this thing to work the way we want it
     to, it has to be broadcasting on the correct
     frequency. Unfortunately, we don't know what that
     frequency is, so we'll use a trial and error
     approach. This remote allows us to adjust the
     signal, and sooner or later we'll get the right
     one. Any questions thus far?

  JOLAN
     How will we know when it is working?

  MITCHELL
     Oh, we'll know when the Prior is no longer able to
     use his powers.

  HAIKON
     And how will we know he will no longer be able to
     use his powers?

  MITCHELL
     Well, "someone" is just going to have to test it
     and find out.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone stares at Mitchell.

  MITCHELL
     Don't worry fellas, that "someone" is me. So, it's
     simple. We disable the Prior, we take a sample of
     his blood, we send it back to the SGC, they finish
     the cure, we turn the Prior against the Ori, and
     call it a day. Jackson, you're driving.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands Daniel the remote.

  DANIEL
     (dryly) Ooh, yay.

  MITCHELL
     SG-22, I want you in defensive positions around
     the perimeter: there, there, there, and there.

  ANNOTATION
     He indicates the positions by pointing. SG-22
     deploys. Mitchell approaches Haikon.

  MITCHELL
     There's, uh, one other small problem. We're not
     exactly sure what the range of that device is, so,
     Haikon, I need you to get the Prior as close as
     possible. Is that a problem?

  HAIKON
     No. No, it is not.

  JOLAN
     You are confident that this will work?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Mitchell exchange looks.

  MITCHELL
     Well, if it doesn't work, we're out of options.


LOCATION--JAFFA COUNCIL CORRIDOR, DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     Jaffa open large metal doors leading from the
     council room, and Bra'tac and Teal'c enter the
     corridor.

  BRA'TAC
     I fear we have lost them.

  TEAL'C
     This battle is far from over.

  BRA'TAC
     But clearly the council was swayed.

  TEAL'C
     The task before us is daunting, but not
     impossible. The Jaffa nation has no appetite for
     war, particularly one that threatens to divide us.

  BRA'TAC
     Indeed. That much is certain.

  TEAL'C
     Mmm. The Ori, on the other hand will not abide
     opposition. They have already ordered Gerak to
     quell the dissension within our ranks.

  BRA'TAC
     Then we must retreat into the shadows and evade
     their attempts to find us.

  TEAL'C
     No, we must make a stand, on Chulak. Faced with
     the prospect of inciting a civil war that would
     kill millions, the council will be left with an
     impossible choice, but ultimately they must decide
     between the Ori and their fellow Jaffa.

  BRA'TAC
     It is only by forcing their hand that they will
     see reason.

  TEAL'C
     So I believe.

  BRA'TAC
     An enterprise this bold will require much support.

  TEAL'C
     Then let us gather a fleet to defend Chulak.


LOCATION--SGC SCIENCE LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Orlin writes on some paper, then crumples it up
     and tosses it aside. He leans his head on his hand
     heavily as Carter enters again. Without looking
     over, Orlin knows she is there.

  ORLIN
     It's like catching a glimpse of someone from the
     corner of your eye, then turning around, and
     they're gone. You begin to actually doubt whether
     you actually ever saw them in the first place.
     Tell me, Sam, how can you regret losing a memory
     you can't even remember?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles sadly and shakes her head.

  CARTER
     What are you working on?

  ORLIN
     Your instructions for assembling the cure in the
     event I am too incapacitated to complete it
     myself. It's a...precaution we have to take.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods soberly. Orlin gestures at the
     scattered papers.

  ORLIN
     The most frustrating part in all this is that I'm
     unable to control what I can hold onto, even for a
     little while. Crucial information I need to finish
     the cure is slipping through my fingers, while
     insignificant minutiae of my experience as an
     Ancient is still fresh and clear in my mind. In
     time, I'll lose it all, but for now, it just
     doesn't seem fair.

  CARTER
     Is there anything I can do to help?

  ORLIN
     No. At this point, it's best if I work alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter squeezes his shoulder and starts to leave.
     She pauses at the door and watches Orlin work for
     a moment before exiting.


LOCATION--SGC OPERATIONS ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel work at various stations. A few,
     including Landry, watch a report on the television
     regarding the virus.

  ANCHORWOMAN
     (on television) Despite the best efforts of all
     involved, the virus continues to spread at an
     alarming rate. The CDC advises anyone who suspects
     they have the virus or who may have come in
     contact with someone who did to quarantine
     themselves and immediately contact--

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman enters the room and approaches Landry.

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, we've just received word that China, Great
     Britain, and Russia have grounded all air travel
     and closed their ports to foreign ships.

  LANDRY
     This is out of control, and it's only going to get
     worse.

  HARRIMAN
     And, according to General Hammond's office, our
     allies have expressed concerns about the cover
     story, specifically, how long we can continue to
     maintain it. They've requested a meeting with you.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Representatives of various nations sit at the
     briefing table with Landry.

  CHEKOV
     So, it is your estimation then, General, that the
     decision to send SG-6 to that particular planet
     was the right one?

  LANDRY
     As evidenced by this plague, we have no viable
     defense against the Ori. The purpose of the
     mission to 656 was to gather intelligence that
     might help us in that respect.

  FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE
     But admittedly, the mission was a failure in the
     worst possible way. And, as a result, millions,
     perhaps billions will lose their lives.

  LANDRY
     The newly appointed liaison between Stargate
     Command and the International Committee was
     informed of, and signed off on, the mission. Your
     representative agreed it was the right call.

  FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE
     There is some concern that Mr. Woolsey may not
     have been fully appraised of all the possible
     ramifications. Now, to his credit, he still
     supports your decision--

  LANDRY
     (interrupting) The Ori were going to strike at us
     sooner or later, and rather than sit back and wait
     for it, we were out there looking for a way to
     stop them, to stop this from happening. And to
     start pointing fingers--

  CHEKOV
     (breaking in) General Lan...

  LANDRY
     At such a crucial time--

  CHEKOV
     General Landry! The purpose of this meeting is not
     to assign blame, but to arrive at a better
     understanding of how this happened. And
     conversely, to avoid something like this ever
     happening again!

  LANDRY
     That's provided we have a second chance!
     Presently, we have no way of stopping this virus.
     People are dying, and there's not a damn thing we
     can do about it!


LOCATION--JAFFA COUNCIL CHAMBERS, DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Bra'tac, and a male council member,
     Cha'ra, are in deep conversation, standing in the
     corridor.

  CHA'RA
     What you propose is madness.

  TEAL'C
     So it may seem, but if the Council believes that
     we are mad and cannot be dissuaded from
     sacrificing our lives, then all the better. We
     must stake everything on the belief that, in the
     end, the Council will value the lives of their
     brothers over the empty promises of the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     They pause as a few Jaffa soldiers pass by. Teal'c
     leans closer and speaks lower.

  TEAL'C
     Time is short, brother. We must gather our forces,
     for the bigger our army, the more lives that Gerak
     must choose to take. We must make this decision as
     difficult as we can for him.

  CHA'RA
     Gerak's no longer one of us. He is a Prior now.

  TEAL'C
     Gerak may be a Prior, but I have no doubt that
     part of him remains Jaffa, and that is the part we
     must seek out.

  CHA'RA
     I still believe this plan to be madness. But then,
     I once considered the very notion of defeating the
     Goa'uld a mere fantasy. Prove me wrong yet again,
     Teal'c. You have my support.

  ANNOTATION
     They grasp hands in the Jaffa version of
     handshakes.

  BRA'TAC
     Thank you, brother.


LOCATION--SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY


LOCATION--VILLAGE AND SURROUNDINGS, SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is among the foliage on the outskirts of
     the village. He checks on the positions of his
     team through his monocular and spots the Prior
     approaching. He keys his radio.

  MITCHELL
     (into radio) He's on his way. Jackson?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel leans against the wall of one of the wooden
     huts, hidden from view. He keys his radio.

  DANIEL
     (into radio) Ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell continuing to watch the Prior's progress.

  MITCHELL
     (into radio) All right, everybody sit tight. Wait
     for my signal. Remember, we need this guy alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell rises and starts towards the village. He
     keys a Sodan device on his vest and becomes
     invisible.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior approaches Haikon and Jolan, who are
     standing in the competition circle.

  PRIOR
     You went to the planet, as I had asked of you?

  HAIKON
     We did.

  PRIOR
     And yet, the non-believers still live.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, hidden from view, keys a frequency into
     the remote.

  HAIKON
     They do.

  PRIOR
     Why have you disobeyed the will of the Ori?

  HAIKON
     Because we take orders from no one.

  PRIOR
     The Ori offer you enlightenment, immortality.

  JOLAN
     Even if that were true, their price is too high.
     What they ask of us goes against the very spirit
     of the Sodan.

  PRIOR
     You doubt the power of the Ori.

  HAIKON
     It is not their power that we doubt, it's their
     worthiness as gods.

  ANNOTATION
     Able to see the circle from his position, Daniel
     remains hidden from the Prior's view. He activates
     the device via the remote, but to no effect. The
     Prior somehow senses something and lashes out with
     his free hand, blasting a wave of telekinetic
     energy around him and knocking Haikon and Jolan
     several feet back. They land outside of the circle
     in a crumpled heap, crying out in pain.

  DANIEL
     (muttering to himself) That's not it.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior turns and sends out another wave in a
     different direction. Mitchell becomes visible and
     gets knocked to the ground by the blast. He raises
     his zat to fire, but the Prior raises his hand and
     knocks Mitchell flat, grunting in pain.

  DANIEL
     (keying the remote) That's not it either.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior crooks his arm back and Mitchell slides
     across the ground on his back. He tries to control
     his body enough to aim his zat, but the Prior
     twists his arm again and Mitchell is lifted
     several feet up into the air, somersaulting, and
     losing his weapon while being held in place mid-
     air. He frantically feels for another weapon while
     looking at the ground in disbelief.

  PRIOR
     "Andras chose to hunt the lion and was eaten by
     his prey."

  DANIEL
     (forcefully pressing the remote) Come on.

  PRIOR
     It was unwise of you to challenge me.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind another crack at it.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel frantically presses codes on the remote.
     The Prior frowns at Mitchell. Mitchell's face
     contorts in pain.

  PRIOR
     What did you hope to achieve by attacking me? Did
     you honestly believe it was possible to capture
     me?

  MITCHELL
     (speaking with difficulty) Well, that was the
     plan.

  PRIOR
     And what purpose would that have served?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell shrugs. The Prior closes his fist, and
     Mitchell begins to choke. Daniel continues to try
     combinations with the remote. Suddenly Mitchell
     drops straight to the ground. He is able to
     breathe and starts to get up. Daniel moves around
     the hut into the open. The Prior watches Mitchell
     in shock, trying to use his powers. Mitchell
     recovers his zat and fires. The Prior drops to the
     ground, unconscious.


LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond, wearing a civilian suit, waits in the
     office as Landry enters.

  LANDRY
     (sighing in relief) George.

  HAMMOND
     Hank, how was the grilling?

  LANDRY
     Medium-rare. I just got off the phone with the
     CDC. A flight left Salt Lake City three days after
     the contagion was identified. It made a stopover
     at O'Hare before continuing on to its final
     destination, Charles de Gaulle Airport.

  HAMMOND
     (sitting in visitor's chair) You're telling me the
     virus has already reached Paris?

  LANDRY
     (sitting in his chair) Three of the people on that
     flight have tested positive for the virus. French
     authorities are doing all they can do track down
     the passengers, flight crew, any ground crew or
     airport personnel that may have come in contact
     with them.

  HAMMOND
     And anyone who came in contact with them and
     anyone who came in contact with those people. You
     know, at the rate this thing is traveling, in
     three days it'll hit the Middle East. Six days,
     it'll be in China!

  LANDRY
     Stock market has already taken a dive, and people
     are panicking. If this thing spreads far enough,
     and does enough damage, it could start
     destabilizing governments. We're going to have to
     be prepared for any and all possibilities.


LOCATION--VILLAGE, SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Keeping an eye on the now unburied device, which
     sits on a pedestal on the perimeter of the circle,
     a member of SG-22 keys the remote and puts his
     hand to his holstered sidearm. The Prior awakens,
     and immediately notices a bruise on the inner side
     of his arm. He looks confused.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, we took the liberty of borrowing a sample of
     your blood. Hope you don't mind.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior stands and notices Daniel and Mitchell
     standing at the outer edge of the competition
     circle. Mitchell casually holds the Prior's staff.

  MITCHELL
     (tossing staff from hand to hand) You looking for
     this?

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior reaches out. Mitchell fakes the staff
     being released from his grasp. SG-22 and the Sodan
     raise their weapons.

  MITCHELL
     Whoa! (Mitchell pulls the staff back confidently.)
     No. That's not going to work.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior looks very confused.

  DANIEL
     That warm, fuzzy feeling you're experiencing may
     be the effects of a device that inhibiting your
     ability to concentrate and focus your powers.

  MITCHELL
     Symptoms may include dizziness, irritability...

  DANIEL
     Nausea.

  MITCHELL
     Mild nausea, and a condition known as hot dog
     fingers.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell waggles his fingers in demonstration.

  PRIOR
     It makes no difference what you do to me. But know
     this, the Ori are all seeing.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Daniel look at the sky in false
     expectation. Haikon and Jolan look at each other
     and shake their heads.

  PRIOR
     They are already aware of this affront to their
     eminence, and shall strike down those who dare to
     defy them.

  MITCHELL
     Nothing yet. You?

  DANIEL
     Drawing a blank.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior watches them incredulously.

  DANIEL
     A little thirsty.

  MITCHELL
     That doesn't count.

  DANIEL
     No, it doesn't.

  PRIOR
     Their ways are not so easily divined. Their ways
     are unseen and veiled in mystery.

  DANIEL
     Right, right, they "have a plan." (Mitchell makes
     quote marks with his fingers on Daniel's behalf) I
     don't suppose you want to tell us what that is?
     Why'd they send you to this galaxy in the first
     place?

  PRIOR
     We are beacons on the road to enlightenment.

  MITCHELL
     No, you're dark-side intergalactic encyclopedia
     salesmen. Unfortunately, the home office hasn't
     been quite upfront with you.

  DANIEL
     Nice work on the metaphor.

  MITCHELL
     Thank you.

  DANIEL
     Well, for starters, did you know that the Ori need
     people to worship them because that's how they
     gain their power?

  ANNOTATION
     The Ori scoffs incredulously and looks around.

  MITCHELL
     He didn't know.

  DANIEL
     No, he didn't know that. No, it's true. Now, we're
     not exactly sure how it works, but from what I've
     heard, they actually drain power from their
     followers. That's why they need worshipers.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Jolan exchange sober looks.

  MITCHELL
     You should talk to them about that the next time
     you're home.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, they might do a better job explaining the
     process to you.

  PRIOR
     Ours is not question, but to rejoice in their
     service, for they are perfection.

  DANIEL
     No, not really, because a perfect being wouldn't
     need to lie to ensure the loyalty of their
     followers. They wouldn't need to promise you
     ascension if they had no intention of delivering
     it.

  PRIOR
     (nonplused) "Those who follow the path of
     righteousness shall be raised up high."

  MITCHELL
     No, they won't. Because the Ori do not share
     power. (He leans forward) They're using you.

  PRIOR
     "Pity not the blind man, for he is hindered not by
     the visions of this world, but rather pity
     yourselves..."

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell starts to turn away.

  MITCHELL
     (low, to Daniel) Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
     blah, blah.

  PRIOR
     (without confidence) ...for he shall see the light
     before you."

  MITCHELL
     (calling back to his team) I'm going to get
     something to eat.


LOCATION--SGC CONTAINMENT AREA LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Various personnel work on blood and chemical
     samples in full hazmat gear. Orlin, also in
     hazmat, takes a sample from a blood vial and puts
     it on a microscope slide. Carter enters the room
     wearing her own hazmat suit. She watches Orlin's
     movements. He turns away from his microscope,
     knocking the container full of glass vials to the
     floor, shattering them and spilling their contents
     across the floor.

  CARTER
     (moving to him) Orlin!

  JOHNSON
     Dammit!

  ANNOTATION
     Col. Johnson heads to the door and hits the
     security alarm.

  CARTER
     Are you okay?

  ORLIN
     I'm fine.

  JOHNSON
     (furious) No, no, he is not fine!

  CARTER
     Colonel!

  JOHNSON
     (still angry) He hasn't been fine in two days! He
     has demonstrated lapses in judgment that put
     everyone in this room at risk.

  CARTER
     Colonel, that is enough!

  ANNOTATION
     Johnson and a clean-up crew move to contain the
     spill.

  ORLIN
     No, he's right, Sam. I can't help you anymore. I'm
     just in the way here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter watches Orlin leave, then turns to see the
     crew clean up the contamination.

LOCATION--HA'TAK BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Bra'tac and Teal'c stand on the bridge. Aron
     stands by the controls for the vessel behind them.

  TEAL'C
     Reflecting on your ill-spent youth, old man?

  BRA'TAC
     (smiling) In truth, I was thinking of you. If this
     gamble succeeds, you will have once again proven
     yourself a great leader perhaps the only one
     capable of uniting this fractured Jaffa nation.

  TEAL'C
     My heart is indeed with our people. But as long as
     the Ori threaten this galaxy, my place is with
     SG-1.

  BRA'TAC
     I understand. Even so, there is no doubt we are
     the poorer for it.

  TEAL'C
     I disagree. After our great victory this day,
     Gerak's influence over our people shall wane. Then
     our nation will rally under the command of a great
     leader. (he pauses, and his voice takes a teasing
     tone) That is, if he has the courage to accept the
     challenge.

  BRA'TAC
     (incredulous) Me?

  TEAL'C
     Who better? Tell me?

  BRA'TAC
     (shaking his head) No. There are many others.

  TEAL'C
     There are many others who covet the position. But
     none who possess the strength and wisdom only you
     can offer.

  BRA'TAC
     It was not too long ago we faced a similarly
     impossible task. And yet, on that day, despite the
     odds, we finally ended generations of oppression
     and struggle by securing victory over Ba'al's
     fleet.

  TEAL'C
     (nodding in agreement) Mmm.

  BRA'TAC
     I remember standing on the pel'tak of that mother
     ship, just as I am doing now, waiting for the
     battle to begin, yet knowing no matter what the
     outcome, it would be the last time I would have to
     take the life of a fellow Jaffa.

  TEAL'C
     No Jaffa blood will be spilled on this day. On
     that, you have my word.

  ANNOTATION
     They bow to each other. Teal'c leaves.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman, reviewing a report, meets Landry outside
     an elevator.

  HARRIMAN
     Sir, we have confirmed cases in Bonn, Amsterdam,
     Rome and Madrid. We have suspected cases in London
     and Athens. The WHO has teams en route. Meanwhile,
     there are suspected cases on the African
     continent. Some of the military leaders in the
     region have already declared martial law.

  LANDRY
     Thank you, Chief.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman walks away, and Landry turns to Carter
     who stands nearby.

  LANDRY
     Colonel, how are things progressing?

  CARTER
     They're not, sir. As you know, the contagion's
     rapidly mutating nature necessitated our requiring
     a specimen of DNA from the original virus. We've
     finally managed to get a blood sample from the
     Prior who started the plague, but so far, it
     hasn't helped. It looks like we've hit a dead end.

  LANDRY
     Let's hope "looks like" is the operative sentiment
     here.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They part ways.


LOCATION--SGC VIP ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Orlin sits on a bed, playing with his shoelaces.
     Landry enters, but stands near the door.

  LANDRY
     Orlin? Sorry to disturb you.

  ORLIN
     Not at all, General. Please...

  ANNOTATION
     Orlin stands up and motions the general to enter.

  LANDRY
     I'd wanted to thank you for everything you've
     done.

  ORLIN
     I wish it could've been...more.

  LANDRY
     Well, you got us as far as you could, the rest is
     gonna have to be up to us. Orlin, I realize I have
     no right to ask this of you, but there is
     something else you might be able to do for us.

  GERAK
     You are outnumbered. Retreat is no longer an

     if you give me no choice. So, what say you,
     Teal'c?

LOCATION--VILLAGE, SODAN HOMEWORLD, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell walks around the perimeter of the
     competition circle while peeling an apple with his
     knife. Sodan warriors and SGC personnel stand at
     evenly spaced intervals along the perimeter,
     guarding the Prior. The Prior looks frustrated and
     bored.

  MITCHELL
     It's a Norwegian cheese, I think. Spelled with a
     "g" or a "j", maybe both. Jgetost, Gjetost,
     something like that. So then what you do is, you
     dice up the cheese, you toss it in with egg
     whites, then you chop up some avocado, throw it
     all together...whoa, daddy! You've got yourself a
     wicked omelet.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry, Daniel and two SGC members approach the
     village.

  MITCHELL
     General! We were just exchanging recipes.

  LANDRY
     I heard. Has he offered up anything?

  MITCHELL
     No, sir. The man doesn't even have a decent pie
     crust.

  LANDRY
     The Ori are not going to ascend you. They lied to
     you, and anyone else they could take advantage of.

  PRIOR
     "Let not the words of deceivers lead you to doubt,
     nor the enticements they offer cause you to
     stray."

  LANDRY
     Exactly, and the sad fact is you gave it all up
     for nothing. The life you had is gone. The Ori
     took it away from you.

  PRIOR
     "Blessed are the true believers, for only they
     shall walk the path, and they shall be welcomed
     unto the realm of the Ori and made as one with
     Them."

  LANDRY
     What did you leave behind? A wife? Children?

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior's face falls. Landry takes a couple of
     steps into the circle. Daniel puts his hand on his
     holstered sidearm and watches, concerned.

  LANDRY
     I have a grown daughter. I wasn't around much when
     she was growing up. That's something I'll always
     regret. Do you ever the think about your kids? The
     time you spent with them? The things you used to
     do together before you threw it all away? But,
     how--how would I know whether the Ori are
     ascending people or not? The truth is, I don't
     know for sure, but he does.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry points behind the Prior. The Prior turns to
     find Orlin standing on the other side of the
     circle.

  ORLIN
     Hello, Damaris.

  PRIOR
     (nonplused) Who are you? How do you?

  ORLIN
     Know?

  ANNOTATION
     Orlin passes Mitchell, enters the circle and
     approaches the Prior. As he speaks, he seems to
     have trouble recalling the correct word at times.

  ORLIN
     Your entire life was an open book to me the moment
     you set foot in this galaxy. I was
     once...ascended, but I took this...form, because
     it was the only way to warn...the humans about the
     Ori. Since I made that decision, I've paid a heavy
     price in terms of the effect it's had on my mind.
     The memories I've...lost.

  PRIOR
     "Life and death. Light and darkness. Hope and
     despair. The rift was created, and on that day,
     the Ori were born."

  ORLIN
     But every so often, something will...stir in me.
     And if I push myself hard enough, I'll remember,
     one more time, before it leaves me forever. Your
     name, Damaris. Your wife, Adina. Your...sons,
     Jaden and Allon.

  PRIOR
     (desperately) "But the hatred of those who strayed
     from the true path festered and bloomed in the
     dark corners of the Avernakis to which they had
     been cast!"

  ORLIN
     And the fact that the...Ori have never...ascended
     any of their...followers.

  PRIOR
     And consumed by this hatred, they poisoned all
     they touched, bringing death, darkness and
     despair.

  ORLIN
     You know that as an Ancient, I wouldn't lie to
     you.

  PRIOR
     (with renewed confidence) And the souls of their
     victims knew no peace, until the Ori came and
     whispered to them: 'sleep, for the end draws
     near'!"

  ANNOTATION
     As he speaks, the Prior turns away from Orlin.
     When he finishes talking, he reaches out with his
     hand towards Landry. Landry begins to slide
     towards the Prior against his will, his heels
     dragging in the sand.

  SG TEAM MEMBER
     He's overcome the device!

  ANNOTATION
     Landry is pulled directly into the Prior's
     outstretched hand. The Prior begins to choke
     Landry with his bare hand. Landry cannot breathe.
     Everyone draws their weapons.

  PRIOR
     "And on that day, all will rejoice, when the Ori
     come and lay them low."

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell fires his weapon. The Prior lets go of
     Landry, a look of surprise on his face, and drops
     to the ground, dead. Landry staggers back as he's
     been released, gasping for air. Daniel holsters
     his weapon and rushes to Landry's aid, lowering
     him gently to the ground.

  DANIEL
     General!

  LANDRY
     (still red-faced and gasping) I'm fine. What was
     he saying?

  ORLIN
     He just told you why the Ori are on their way to
     this galaxy. They're coming...to destroy the
     Ancients.


LOCATION--CHULAK, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak and Teal'c meet on a wooded path at the
     planet's surface.

  GERAK
     You have made the right choice. There is no honor
     in fighting an unwinnable battle.

  TEAL'C
     Nor peace at the hands of a tyrant.

  GERAK
     I assure you, the Ori are not the Goa'uld.

  TEAL'C
     (sadly) Have we truly lived as slaves for so long
     that we must fear being free?

  GERAK
     It has nothing to do with freedom. Enlightenment
     is just within our reach.

  TEAL'C
     Or so the Ori would have us believe.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c approaches a stone monument in a clearing.
     Gerak looks stricken when he reads the glyphs on
     the monument and realizes where they are. Teal'c
     watches his reaction.

  GERAK
     Why have you led me here?

  TEAL'C
     I thought it fitting that on this day when we must
     sacrifice our short-lived freedom, that we do so
     here, at the site of the battle of Tazek'sur,
     where your father gave his life for this very
     cause. You began to doubt the Goa'uld long before
     this rebellion took shape, Gerak. It was your
     father's death at their hands that led you to
     question 'what god is so deserving of my
     worship?'"

  GERAK
     You were not the one who was chosen. You did not
     witness the wonders I beheld.

  TEAL'C
     Did they raise the dead? Heal the sick and
     wounded? Destroy their enemy with but a wave of
     their hand?

  GERAK
     The Goa'uld deceived us. The Ori's powers are
     pure.

  TEAL'C
     And what is the measure of a god, Gerak? Is it the
     scope of their power, or how they choose to wield
     that power? Would a god who is prepared to lead us
     on the path of enlightenment so contradict this
     divine benevolence by destroying all those who
     refuse to believe in him?

  GERAK
     Those who refuse to believe must die.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c approaches and leans close to Gerak.

  TEAL'C
     I understand how difficult this must be for you,
     Gerak. Nearing your final years, you so
     desperately long for the enlightenment we all
     seek. This is not the way to save yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak is visibly upset.

  GERAK
     I only wanted to avoid bloodshed.

  TEAL'C
     Stay this course, and you will have no choice but
     to spill the blood of your brothers...

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c grabs hold of Gerak's Prior staff and
     points the orb towards himself.

  TEAL'C
     ...and you may start with me. For if I have a
     choice between resistance or returning to the life
     of slavery, then I choose to die free.

     Daniel, Carter and Mitchell sit at the briefing
     table, looking tired and as if they are waiting.
     Hammond enters without their knowledge.

  HAMMOND
     It's always darkest before the dawn.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Carter, and Mitchell rise, visibly
     surprised to see Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     My uncle used to say that all the time, he was a
     wedding planner.

  CARTER
     (beaming) General Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     At ease.

  CARTER
     Sir, when did you arrive?

  HAMMOND
     Oh, I've been here a while. But, you were busy,
     and I thought it was best not to disturb you.
     (turning to Mitchell) Colonel Mitchell.
     Congratulations on getting the band back together.

  MITCHELL
     Thank you, sir. It wasn't easy.

  HAMMOND
     No, but worth it. You couldn't ask for three
     better people watching your back. (turns back to
     Carter and Daniel) I'm sorry I won't get a chance
     to see Teal'c before I go.

  CARTER
     You're leaving, sir?

  HAMMOND
     Oh, I'm off to Peterson. I've been called back to
     Washington.

  DANIEL
     Well, it's-it's good to see you again, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Carter give wistful smiles to Hammond.
     He smiles in return.

  HAMMOND
     It's good to see you again, too. All of you. Give
     my best to Teal'c. Take care of each other. Take
     care of General Landry, too.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leaves and the three SG-1 members look
     thoughtful.


LOCATION--SGC ISOLATION WARD AND ITS OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry is one of five patients in the isolation
     ward. They are all in hospital scrubs lying on
     beds. Many are on oxygen. Medical personnel work
     on the patients while wearing full hazmat gear.
     From the observation room, Lam looks down at her
     father and the others.

  LAM
     You're awake. How are you feeling?

  LANDRY
     After that little nap, better than I've felt all
     day. How's that for irony? How are Mitchell and
     Dr. Jackson?

  LAM
     They're clean.

  LANDRY
     And Orlin?

  LAM
     I just ran a battery of tests on him. I'm afraid
     the effort of drawing out all those memories has
     taken a toll, accelerated the degenerative
     process, so he's in his quarters, resting.

  LANDRY
     You look tired, Carolyn. You should get some
     sleep.

  LAM
     I can't. Not yet.

  LANDRY
     I can make that an order.

  LAM
     The last time you ordered me to bed, I think I was
     six.

  LANDRY
     (chuckling) You were just as stubborn back then.

  LAM
     I spoke to Mom recently.

  LANDRY
     (looks upset) How is she?

  ANNOTATION
     Though appearing to try and keep her emotions in,
     Lam's voice starts to break as she speaks and her
     words take on a harsh, bitter, and frustrated
     tone.

  LAM
     Worried. All those years growing up I was growing
     up, I resented the fact that you never told us
     anything about your work, about why you had to
     leave us for days, sometimes weeks at a time. (She
     pauses and her voice, though still breaking, is
     softer in tone.) But, now, I'm beginning to
     understand how hard it must have been for you.
     Talking to Mom the other day, I wanted to reassure
     her, to tell her everything, but I couldn't. It
     was hard.

  ANNOTATION
     As Lam speaks, Landry fights back tears.

     Klaxons start to blare. The interruption makes Lam
     try and compose herself again.

     Lam observes Gerak's entry in surprise. Teal'c and
     Carter join her.

  LAM
     (nervous) What's going on?

  TEAL'C
     Gerak has arrived to assist us.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Mitchell rush into the room and join
     the others in watching Gerak. From the window,
     they can see Gerak approach Landry's bed and
     pause.

  TEAL'C
     Why do you hesitate, Gerak?


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  GERAK
     If I help you, I will die.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  GERAK
     (from the isolation room) ...but I will
     die...FREE!

  ANNOTATION
     Gerak slams his staff into the floor, and the orb
     glows with a bright light. The others observe as
     this wave of light brightens the entire room and
     spreads outward.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDORS

  ANNOTATION
     Personnel pause and look in wonder as the bright
     light spreads everywhere.


LOCATION--SGC COMMISSARY

  ANNOTATION
     The light spreads throughout the room. People
     eating and moving about stop and watch it pass.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Through the window, the team and Lam observes
     Gerak suddenly becoming engulfed in flames.

  TEAL'C


  GERAK!


  ANNOTATION
     Gerak's body burns a few seconds more until
     nothing is left. The team looks on in shock.
     Landry and the other patients begin to wake up.
     Lam races over to a monitor.

  MITCHELL
     What the hell just happened?

  CARTER
     I thought the Ori weren't able to take action in
     this galaxy without inciting the Ancients?

  DANIEL
     They can't.

  ANNOTATION
     The team watch as medical personnel in hazmat gear
     rush into the isolation room to check on the
     waking patients.

  DANIEL
     (shaking his head) It must have been some sort of
     physiological failsafe they put in place when they
     made him a Prior in the event he ever turned.

  ANNOTATION
     Lam studies the patients' vital statistics on the
     monitor.

  LAM
     They're normalizing. It worked.

  ANNOTATION
     She races out of the room.


LOCATION--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lam enters the room without a hazmat suit and move
     immediately to her father, checking his heart with
     a stethoscope and smiling at him in relief.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANCHORWOMAN
     (on television screen) The final death toll of the
     pandemic has been estimated at a little over three
     thousand, worldwide, but health officials are
     quick to point out that it could have been much
     worse. As distribution of the vaccine continues,
     many have begun to ask how this could have
     happened in the first place. And, more to the
     point, where did this virus originate?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry turns off the television set with his
     remote and sits at the head of the table. Lam,
     Mitchell, Teal'c and Daniel are already seated.

  LANDRY
     We were lucky. There might not be someone like
     Gerak to help us next time.

  LAM
     It wasn't just Gerak. He cured the people on the
     base. From them, we were able to isolate an
     antibody, and manufacture a vaccine using Orlin's
     formula. Thanks to Orlin's work, we should be able
     to prevent the Priors from attacking us this way
     again.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, I reckon they've got a pretty wide repertoire.

  TEAL'C
     The Ori will undoubtedly view this defeat as
     nothing more than a minor setback. It will not be
     enough to dissuade them from continuing their
     incursion into this galaxy.

  DANIEL
     Certainly not if their endgame is to destroy the
     Ancients.

  LANDRY
     Given the fact that they're personally threatened,
     do you think the Ancients will take measures to
     defend themselves?

  DANIEL
     If it comes to that, it's possible, but I think
     we're a long way from the Ori posing the Ancients
     a serious threat.

  MITCHELL
     (dryly) No, they're just a threat to everyone else
     in the galaxy.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel makes a face in agreement.

  MITCHELL
     So how's Orlin?

  LANDRY
     His condition has stabilized, but I'm afraid the
     damage has already been done.


LOCATION--LONG TERM CARE FACILITY COMMON ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Orlin sits at a table working on a jigsaw puzzle.
     Other patients sit quietly elsewhere in the room.
     Carter, in civilian clothes, approaches Orlin
     hesitantly.

  CARTER
     Hello.

  ORLIN
     Hi. Who are you?

  CARTER
     My name's Samantha. (gestures at puzzle) Do you
     need help with this?

  ORLIN
     (half-smiling) Sure.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sits at the table.

  ORLIN
     I finished the outside, so you can help me with
     the inside?

  CARTER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     They both work on the puzzle.
