<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The Jaffa council sit and listen to the newly created Prior, Gerak, as he stands in the center circular podium and addresses them. Teal'c has stepped away from his chair and stands listening intently.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>GERAK: Like you, my judgment was clouded by suspicion and distrust. But the Ori sensed my misgivings, forgave me my weaknesses, and showed me their power. I stand before you today, as proof of their divine might.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>TEAL'C: They have poisoned your mind. The Ori's promises are hollow. We have learned from the Ancients that they are not ascending their followers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>TEAL'C: One of the Ancients returned to human form to warn us that the Ori gain strength by sapping the power from their followers. That is why they seek our support! The Ori are not some benevolent gods, offering you the path to enlightenment. They are but manipulative beings who will use you and discard you once you have served their purpose.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Gerak raises his hands from his sides. Copies of the Book of Origin at each council member's seats begin to rise several inches off the table. The council members' eyes widen in surprise. Bra'tac stands up, next to Teal'c, and they exchange concerned looks. Gerak lowers his arms, and all the books fall back to the table with loud thumps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>JOLAN: We went to the planet as the Prior instructed. Two hundred strong to eliminate any threat. We were expecting an army. What we found were simple farmers, too naive to understand the consequences they faced for daring to defy the Ori.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>HAIKON: The Sodan are proud warriors. We do not kill innocent people.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>JOLAN: We left them unharmed. But before returning here, we had to put all doubts to rest, so we traveled to another world, one rumored to have refused the Ori. The entire civilization was decimated by a mysterious plague. There was no one left.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>CARTER: I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about. We just got your test results back. They show significant and progressive changes in different areas of your brain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>ORLIN: What kind of changes?</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>CARTER: A degenerative process that's already started to impair your cognitive functions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>ORLIN: I knew that when I took on human form, the memories I brought with me would eventually fade.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>CARTER: That's only part of it. I mean it's not so much a result of you losing the memories, but more a consequence of your trying to hold onto them. Orlin, by not letting go of the Ancient knowledge, you're damaging your brain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>ORLIN: Yes. My human mind if failing under the...weight of so much information.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>CARTER: But you have a choice now! Your brain is fighting a losing battle, stripping away whatever it can in an attempt to salvage the memories related to the cure. Give them up, and you could stop this from progressing any further.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>ORLIN: I can't do that. There's too much at stake.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>ORLIN: It's too complex. You won't fully understand the process.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>CARTER: Try me! Orlin, you don't have to sacrifice yourself! Let go, before it's too late.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ORLIN: I can't risk entrusting this job to anyone but myself. I have to see this through, Sam. I'm sorry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell calibrates the remote to the anti-Prior device and buries it in the sand of the competition ring. Sodan warriors, Daniel, and SG-22 stand nearby.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>MITCHELL: We're good.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>DANIEL: Okay, this device will emit a high ultra-sonic frequency targeting a specific portion of the Prior's brain, temporarily blocking his ability to use his powers. Now, the good news is, it won't have any effect on us. The bad news is, it may not have any effect on the Prior, either.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>MITCHELL: In order for this thing to work the way we want it to, it has to be broadcasting on the correct frequency. Unfortunately, we don't know what that frequency is, so we'll use a trial and error approach. This remote allows us to adjust the signal, and sooner or later we'll get the right one. Any questions thus far?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>JOLAN: How will we know when it is working?</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Oh, we'll know when the Prior is no longer able to use his powers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>HAIKON: And how will we know he will no longer be able to use his powers?</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Everyone stares at Mitchell.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Don't worry fellas, that "someone" is me. So, it's simple. We disable the Prior, we take a sample of his blood, we send it back to the SGC, they finish the cure, we turn the Prior against the Ori, and call it a day. Jackson, you're driving.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He hands Daniel the remote.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He indicates the positions by pointing. SG-22 deploys. Mitchell approaches Haikon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>MITCHELL: There's, uh, one other small problem. We're not exactly sure what the range of that device is, so, Haikon, I need you to get the Prior as close as possible. Is that a problem?</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>HAIKON: No. No, it is not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>TEAL'C: The task before us is daunting, but not impossible. The Jaffa nation has no appetite for war, particularly one that threatens to divide us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Mmm. The Ori, on the other hand will not abide opposition. They have already ordered Gerak to quell the dissension within our ranks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>TEAL'C: No, we must make a stand, on Chulak. Faced with the prospect of inciting a civil war that would kill millions, the council will be left with an impossible choice, but ultimately they must decide between the Ori and their fellow Jaffa.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>BRA'TAC: It is only by forcing their hand that they will see reason.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>ORLIN: It's like catching a glimpse of someone from the corner of your eye, then turning around, and they're gone.

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>ORLIN: The most frustrating part in all this is that I'm unable to control what I can hold onto, even for a little while. Crucial information I need to finish the cure is slipping through my fingers, while insignificant minutiae of my experience as an Ancient is still fresh and clear in my mind. In time, I'll lose it all, but for now, it just doesn't seem fair.</td></tr>
