TEASER

LOCATION--A FOREST CLEARING NEAR A POND, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A Winnebago camper truck is parked next to a pond
     filled with lily pads. There is a large telescope
     set up next to the camper and a smaller one a
     short distance away. A young man is speaking into
     a cell phone. There is a beagle tethered to the
     camper.

  TELESCOPE GUY
     (agitated, pacing) No. Listen to me, now. If you
     can't confirm my observations then you must have
     the coordinates wrong because there is definitely
     something up there. (listens for a moment) For the
     tenth time, it is in Cassiopeia. Declination
     sixty-one degrees, six minutes; right ascension
     two hours, forty-eight minutes. (listens) Well,
     that's impossible. (listens) Yes, I'm sure!
     (listens) Listen. Listen. I am not some crackpot
     phoning in a UFO here. I happen to be the
     cofounder of the Northern Susquenita County
     Amateur Astronomy Society, and I've been tracking
     this thing for three nights. Now whatever it is,
     it is very big, it is very close and I am not
     going to shut up about his until--

  ANNOTATION
     He turns toward the sound of vehicles as the
     beagle barks. Two black Suburbans arrive via a
     dirt path. Four USAF officers and two men in black
     suits get out of the trucks and walk toward him.

  TELESCOPE GUY
     (into phone) Nevermind.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is briefing the rest of SG-1 and Hammond.
     She is standing in front of a large view screen
     with an image of an asteroid.

  CARTER
     This image was generated based on satellite
     observations made over the last few hours. The
     asteroid has an irregular shape, but we've
     calculated its length from end-to-end to be
     approximately 137 kilometers.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) I've seen this movie. It hits Paris.

  CARTER
     Actually sir, it will strike somewhere in the
     Artic Circle. Probably Greenland or the Barents
     Sea.

  DANIEL
     And nobody knows this but us? How is that
     possible?

  ANNOTATION
     The screen changes to show a view of the solar
     system.

  CARTER
     Well the asteroid was actually discovered by a
     civilian who has since been 'persuaded' to keep it
     quiet. The reason no one else has detected it is
     that the object's path is highly atypical. It's a
     rogue well outside the plane of the solar system
     occupied by the planets and the asteroid belt. In
     fact, it's a fluke that anyone saw it at all. We
     got lucky.

  DANIEL
     I don't see how in any conceivable way this is
     lucky.

  CARTER
     Well, if this had happened seven or eight years
     ago, there'd be nothing we could do about it. The
     Stargate opens other options for us.

  O'NEILL
     A little help from our friends?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps the Tok'ra could be of assistance.

  HAMMOND
     Unfortunately, they've been on the run since the
     Goa'uld attacked their base at Ravanna. We've
     already sent a message asking for their help, but
     so far there hasn't been any reply.

  O'NEILL
     The Asgard owe us a favor.

  DANIEL
     We could contact them through the K'tau, through
     their Hall of Wisdom.

  TEAL'C
     According to the treaty with the Goa'uld, the
     Asgard cannot prevent natural disasters from
     occurring on protected planets.

  O'NEILL
     Hey, the Goa'uld tried to make the Tollan send a
     bomb through the iris. Screw the treaty.

  DANIEL
     (to O'Neill) Well, one of our allies will help.

  CARTER
     I hope you're right. Otherwise, in eleven days and
     sixteen hours all life on Earth will be wiped out.


LOCATION--ASGARD CONFERENCE CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is talking to the Asgard council via a
     holographic projection. Four Asgard are looking
     down at his image from their raised chairs.

  FREYR
     I'm afraid the answer is 'no'.

  O'NEILL
     (in shimmering holographic form) Come on guys,
     throw me a bone here!

  FREYR
     The Protected Planets Treaty leaves no room for
     interpretation.

  O'NEILL
     They tried to attack us.

  FREYR
     It was the Tollans who attempted to send the
     explosive device through your iris.

  O'NEILL
     By whose order?

  ANOTHER ASGARD
     The System Lords deny any knowledge of this
     incident.

  O'NEILL
     Of course they deny it!

  A THIRD ASGARD
     The Treaty does allow for the arbitration of such
     disputes. We would need to assemble a commission
     of inquiry consisting of equal numbers of Asgard
     and Goa'uld representatives. We would also need
     corroborating testimony from the Tollans.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, now see that's going to be a problem, seeing
     as how they've been wiped out by the Goa'uld!

  FREYR
     That is unfortunate.

  O'NEILL
     And I suppose when Earth gets hit by that rock,
     and we're all wiped out that's going to be
     unfortunate too?.

  FREYR
     Very.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stares in disbelief.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 and Hammond are seated at the table.

  O'NEILL
     ...and after that I kind of lost my temper.

  HAMMOND
     (perturbed) What exactly does that mean?

  DANIEL
     Let's just say Jack made a reference to Freyr's
     mother.

  HAMMOND
     We'll discuss Colonel O'Neill's diplomatic
     shortcomings later. Right now, I'd like to know
     what options remain.

  O'NEILL
     I say we nuke it ourselves.

  CARTER
     We have sufficiently large-yield warheads to
     deflect it. But we don't have a multi-stage
     delivery system capable of reaching the asteroid
     in time.

  DANIEL
     Wait a minute; what about the cargo ship that
     Jacob and I crashed on Ravanna during the Goa'uld
     attack? That must still be there.

  O'NEILL
     In how many pieces?

  CARTER
     Well, our understanding of Goa'uld technology has
     improved quite a bit. We might be able to fix it.

  HAMMOND
     How much time?

  CARTER
     Given the right team, maybe a couple of days?

  HAMMOND
     I'll assign anyone you need Major.

  ANNOTATION
     Cater nods.

  DANIEL
     Assuming we can fix it, how long would it take to
     fly back to Earth?

  CARTER
     Ravanna's not exactly next door. Even pushing the
     engines past a hundred percent, it would take
     eight, nine days.

  TEAL'C
     Leaving little margin for error.

  HAMMOND
     Then let's get started. Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone gets up, and Hammond walks toward O'Neill
     to speak with him privately.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel, I have every confidence in SG-1's
     abilities. However, as a contingency, the
     President has ordered me to begin Alpha-team
     evacuations through the Gate. Major Davis will be
     arriving shortly from the Pentagon to coordinate.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  GENERAL
     If Major Carter is unable to repair the cargo ship
     you will report immediately to the Alpha Site and
     assume command.

  O'NEILL
     (Look of concern) General?

  HAMMOND
     No debates on this one, Jack. That's an order.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks away.

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) Yeah.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole is open, and the klaxon is sounding.
     Various personnel are busily preparing equipment
     including a MALP, which has a large bomb attached
     to it. SG-1 enters, armed and dressed for the
     mission.

  CARTER
     We're good to go sir.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, show 'em the way.

  TEAL'C
     (smiling and walking up the ramp, gesturing to the
     others) This way.

  DANIEL
     (looking at bomb on MALP) This, uh, big enough?

  CARTER
     Packs twelve hundred Naquadah-enhanced megatons.

  DANIEL
     And that's a lot?

  CARTER
     This is the most powerful warhead ever created,
     Daniel. It's the equivalent of one billion tons of
     TNT.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) That's a lot.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods sharply. O'Neill reaches out to
     Spellman, who is backing down the ramp with a
     metal case in each hand.

  O'NEILL
     Hey! What are you doing?

  SPELLMAN
     Sorry, I can't do this. I can give you a list of
     some very good engineers.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and O'Neill walk him back up the ramp, with
     Daniel following.

  O'NEILL
     Come on, Spellman. I do this every day.

  SPELLMAN
     That's probably because you don't actually
     understand what happens to your body when you go
     through this thing. I do.

  CARTER
     (tugging on his arm to get him to come through
     with her) We need you for this mission.

  SPELLMAN
     It defies the laws of physics and you know it!

  O'NEILL
     Spellman, you're going.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives a little yell as the both grab him by the
     arms and push him through.


LOCATION--WORMHOLE


LOCATION--RAVANNA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Tok'ra cargo ship is resting partially
     embedded in mud. The engineers and SG-1 are
     walking toward it along a muddy path, the MALP
     moving next to them.


LOCATION--TOK'RA CARGO SHIP, MAIN CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     The outer doors open and O'Neill, Daniel, Carter
     and the engineers enter, with the SG-1 members
     securing the area, P-90's at the ready. Teal'c
     guards the entrance.

  O'NEILL
     It doesn't look so bad.

  CARTER
     (addressing engineers) Okay, our first priority is
     auxiliary power. Then it's hyper drive and life
     support.

  WEBBER
     Right.

  SPELLMAN
     Is there a restroom? My first priority.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and the engineers leave.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, they'll fix it up.

  DANIEL
     I'm confident.

  O'NEILL
     Me too.

  TEAL'C
     As am I.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The asteroid is tumbling through space as it heads
     toward Earth.


LOCATION--TOK'RA CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     There is a montage of Carter and the engineers
     going about the repairs while Daniel reads from a
     notebook and O'Neill gazes at a glowing ball. At
     one point, Daniel is asleep against the side of
     the MALP. Spellman is working at a laptop on the
     MALP. Webber enters.

  WEBBER
     I looked again. I still can't find it.

  SPELLMAN
     Did you check the guidance system?

  TECH WEBBER
     Twice.

  CARTER
     Okay, I guess we'll have to assume that there
     isn't one on board.

  O'NEILL
     One what?

  CARTER
     We're about ready to attempt and engine start,
     sir.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, fine. Assume there isn't one, what?

  CARTER
     Recall device.

  O'NEILL
     (getting worked up) The X-301? That was you guys?

  TECH WEBBER
     You have to admit it performed beautifully right
     up to the point where you and Teal'c were sent
     into deep space.

  O'NEILL
     (laughing sarcastically) Yeah.

  DANIEL
     (sarcastic) Nice work.

  O'NEILL
     Carter.

  CARTER
     Attempting engine start.

  ANNOTATION
     She pushes a series of buttons around a console on
     the bridge. The ship starts to come alive then
     everything dies.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  ANNOTATION
     She tries again, and this time the power stays on.
     Teal'c smiles.

  CARTER
     That's got it sir. We're good to go. I'll repair
     the remaining systems on the way. (to engineers)
     Once you get to the Ravanna Ggate, dial the Alpha
     Site. They'll be expecting you.

  SPELLMAN
     I think I speak for about six billion people when
     I say...good luck.

  CARTER
     (smiling and nodding) You, too.

  ANNOTATION
     The engineers leave the ship.

  O'NEILL
     (to them as they leave) I'm gonna want to talk to
     you guys.

  CARTER
     Teal'c, try to take it easy on the engines when we
     take off.

  DANIEL
     Why?

  CARTER
     Well I'm just slightly concerned that if we push
     them too hard, and they burn out before we reach
     escape velocity that... (noting O'Neill's raised
     eyebrows) ...we'll come crashing back to the
     planet.

  DANIEL
     I'm confident.

  O'NEILL
     Me, too.

  TEAL'C
     As am I.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks worried.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     There is activity in the Gate room as people
     prepare to embark. Many have duffel bags.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond descends the spiral stairs followed by
     Major Davis. Sgt. Davis is at the controls.

  MAJOR DAVIS
     ...I appreciate that sir, but if we don't hear
     from SG1...

  SERGEANT DAVIS
     I'm getting a message, sir. It's SG-1.

  HAMMOND
     (To Major Davis) You were saying, Major?

  SERGEANT DAVIS
     The signal is being relayed through AF SATCOMM,
     sir. Audio only.

  HAMMOND
     Pipe it through, Sergeant.

  SERGEANT DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

  CARTER
     (over comm system) ...please respond.

  HAMMOND
     SG-1, this is General Hammond, please respond.

  CARTER
     (over comm system, then ON bridge of cargo ship)
     Sir, this is Carter. We've just dropped out of
     hyperspace, and we should reach the asteroid in a
     few minutes.

  HAMMOND
     We're relieved to hear that Major. You sent those
     engineers to the Alpha Site ten days ago.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The cargo ship is flying in normal space.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF TOK'RA CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is in one of the pilot chairs, while
     O'Neill and Daniel wait in the background.

  CARTER
     The ship's barely flying as it is, sir. We're
     lucky we made it this far.

  HAMMOND
     (over audio in ship) Understood.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  HAMMOND
     Proceed with your mission.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives Major Davis a look and leaves.

  CARTER
     (over audio) Yes, sir.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF TOK'RA CARGO SHIP

  CARTER
     All right. Thirty-nine minutes before impact, the
     asteroid will reach the fail safe position. Once
     it's past that point, it'll be too close to Earth
     for the explosion to deflect it. (looks at her
     watch) That leaves us three and a half hours.

  DANIEL
     So, we just drop off the bomb and, what?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns on a holographic screen that shows a
     rotating graphic of the asteroid. Teal'c is seated
     in the other chair, piloting the ship.

  CARTER
     Our scan shows that the asteroid is pot-marked
     with impact craters and fissures. We fly the ship
     into the deepest crater we can find at a right
     angle to its current trajectory. The crater itself
     should help direct the explosive force of the bomb
     like a rocket nozzle.

  ANNOTATION
     As she speaks, the graphic illustrates the blast
     direction and its deflecting power. The other team
     members react with varying levels of worry.

  CARTER
     When we're a few meters above the surface, we ring
     down the MALP with the bomb. Then we land and two
     of us go EVA.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns off the screen.

  O'NEILL
     (Gestures between himself and Carter) That would
     be you and me.

  CARTER
     We walk the MALP down into one of the fissures of
     the bottom of the crater to focus as much of the
     blast as possible. We set the timer, and then we
     get out of there.

  O'NEILL
     (smiling dubiously) Piece of cake.

  CARTER
     There is one other thing. We're about to pass
     through the Leonids. It's a cometary trial that
     Earth passes through periodically. The shields
     should help protect the ship, but anyone caught
     outside is going to have to find cover--fast.

  ANNOTATION
     Th ship groans loudly and shakes.

  O'NEILL
     What was that?

  TEAL'C
     I'm having difficulty with the sub-light engines.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shakes further and there is loud
     rumbling.

  DANIEL
     (looks up then looks to Teal'c) Yes, you are.

  CARTER
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves the bridge. O'Neill slaps the panel
     next to Daniel and follows.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP ENGINE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Carter opens a panel, and slides out a drawer with
     colored crystals. O'Neill is standing behind her.

  O'NEILL
     What is it?

  CARTER
     (shining penlight over crystals) We're building up
     an overload in the control systems.

  O'NEILL
     Backups?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) We don't have any.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a large electrical discharge from the
     crystals. Carter yells in pain and falls to the
     floor. O'Neill drops immediately to her side.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  SERGEANT DAVIS
     Sir, we just lost SG-1's signal.

  HAMMOND
     (into microphone) SG-1 this is Hammond. Do you
     read me? SG-1, please respond.

  ANNOTATION
     Sgt. Davis shakes his head as Hammond and Major
     Davis exchange worried looks.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP ENGINE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill helps Carter to sit up. She appears
     disoriented.

  O'NEILL
     How's the head?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c enters.

  TEAL'C
     The sub-light engines have shut down.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks up with concern


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  DANIEL
     Big asteroid problem here!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sees the asteroid looming very large in the
     front viewscreen. It is rotating quickly and
     growing closer. The others walk onto the bridge.

  CARTER
     Try using maneuvering thrusters to slow us down.

  DANIEL
     I am. It's not working.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gets out of the pilot seat so Teal'c can
     sit in it. He moves to the co-pilot seat.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson is correct. Manuevering thrusters
     appear to be insufficient.

  CARTER
     They're all we've got.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  MAJOR DAVIS
     (to Hammond) Sir? Deep space tracking still has a
     fix on the ship, but we show them approaching the
     asteroid way too fast.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     The ship is still dropping quickly to the rotating
     asteroid.

  O'NEILL
     (concerned) Any time now.

  TEAL'C
     Thrusters are in full reverse, O'Neill.

  CARTER
     We're coming in a lot faster than we should be.

  DANIEL
     Yes, we are.

  CARTER
     Faster than we should with thrusters that at
     maximum. Ninety meters per second. Eighty. This
     rate of deceleration isn't gonna cut it. We're
     gonna hit.


LOCATION--SPACE NEAR ASTEROID

  ANNOTATION
     The cargo ship moves nose down into a deep crater,
     rather than hitting the highest surface.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  O'NEILL
     (surprised they didn't crash) What happened?

  CARTER
     We're inside a deep crater. Fifty meters per
     second. Forty. Thirty.


LOCATION--SURFACE OF ASTEROID

  ANNOTATION
     The ship decelerates rapidly, rotates, and comes
     to rest hovering just above the surface at the
     bottom of the crater.

     Teal'c and Daniel are amazed and confused.

  CARTER
     We stopped descending.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  MAJOR DAVIS
     (into microphone) No, I understand. Thank you.
     (worried, to Hammond) Sir? We just got a message
     from NASA. According to their latest calculations,
     SG-1 has crashed into the asteroid's surface at
     over sixty meters per second.

  HAMMOND
     Do they have confirmation?

  MAJOR DAVIS
     No, sir. It's an estimate based on the ship's last
     known position and trajectory.

  HAMMOND
     (desperately) Any chance of survivors?

  ANNOTATION
     Sergeant Davis looks at Hammond with deep concern
     before looking to Major Davis.

  MAJOR DAVIS
     (shakes head) At that velocity sir, it's... very
     unlikely. (standing and walking over to Hammond)
     Sir, if this is true, and the mission is down...
     We're out of options. It's time to call the
     President.

  ANNOTATION
     Sergeant Davis looks on in disbelief as the Major
     and General exchange resigned looks.

     As are shields and communication.

  DANIEL
     It might be easier to list what is working.

  O'NEILL
     The bomb?

  CARTER
     Is good to go, sir. If it comes right down to it,
     we can detonate it right here. What's our
     position?

  DANIEL
     Well, personally I'm against it. If you want to
     know where the ship is, we're about five meters
     above the surface at the bottom of the crater.

  TEAL'C
     The rings will be functional at that distance.

  CARTER
     Alright. Here goes.

  ANNOTATION
     She opens a control panel, activates the rings and
     sends the bomb, on its platform, to the surface.

  O'NEILL
     Let's suit up.


LOCATION--CARGO AREA OF SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     He and Carter walk to the cargo area. She bends
     over to open a container and becomes dizzy,
     putting a hand to forehead. O'Neill walks over and
     helps her to stand.

  O'NEILL
     Carter? You all right?

  CARTER
     I'm fine, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Look. You took a pretty good shot. Why don't you
     sit this one out?

  CARTER
     (unconvincingly) No, I'm fine, really.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c and I can handle it.

  CARTER
     (disappointed) Yes, sir.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is speaking on his red phone.

  HAMMOND
     No, sir, there's been no response on the radio.
     But if they crashed, there should have been
     visible evidence. We've found nothing. Now frankly
     sir, if SG-1 survived and they managed to complete
     their mission, then no one needs to know any of
     this ever happened. If not, then there's nothing
     anyone can do that will make the slightest bit of
     difference. Going public now would only serve to
     create panic. (pauses listening) Yes, sir, I know
     how you feel. My place is here. Thank you, Mr.
     President.


LOCATION--AIRLOK OF CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     The air hisses out.

  CARTER
     (via radio) Sir, once you're off the ship you'll
     experience very little gravity, but the asteroid's
     surface is mostly iron and your boots are
     magnetized, so you shouldn't go spinning off into
     space.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, that's very reassuring there, Carter. Thank
     you very much.

  TEAL'C
     Depressurization complete. Opening outer door.

  ANNOTATION
     He pushes more buttons and the outer doors slide
     open, revealing the MALP with the bomb, the wall
     of the crater they are in, and the Earth above the
     horizon. They exit the ship.


LOCATION--SURFACE OF ASTEROID

  O'NEILL
     (taking remote from MALP) I'll drive.

  ANNOTATION
     The MALP begins to move, and they follow it along
     between the crater walls into a crevice.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working out something on her laptop as
     Daniel sits in one of the command chairs.

  DANIEL
     What is it?

  CARTER
     Well, our approach to the asteroid was a lot
     faster then it should have been, even on thrusters
     only. I'm going to check something.


LOCATION--CREVICE ON SURFACE OF ASTEROID

  ANNOTATION
     They reach a dead end in the crevice.

  TEAL'C
     We can proceed no further.

  O'NEILL
     Then this will do.

  ANNOTATION
     He sets the timer on the bomb to 2:00 hours and
     starts it.

  O'NEILL
     Weapon is armed.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk away, back in the direction they came.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  CARTER
     Something's not right. The asteroid's
     gravitational field is way stronger than we
     thought.

  DANIEL
     So?

  CARTER
     Well, gravity is determined by mass, and mass is
     determined by size and composition.

  DANIEL
     So?

  CARTER
     So the core of the asteroid must be made up of
     something a lot heavier than nickel and iron.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a loud thud outside the ship.

  DANIEL
     So, what was that?

  CARTER
     We're passing through the Leonid's way sooner than
     I expected. (urgently, into radio) Colonel O'Neill
     what's your position?

  O'NEILL
     Hey Carter, any chance of getting those shields in
     play here?


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     There are numerous more impacts hitting the ship.

  CARTER
     (into radio) We're working on it, sir--stand by.
     (to Daniel) Daniel, try to re-route power from the
     hyper-drive. Bypass systems are all blown.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel moves to the center console. There is a
     loud impact and the sound of venting atmosphere.

  CARTER
     Hull breech! We're venting atmosphere!


LOCATION--SURFACE OF ASTEROID

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill and Teal'c walk, rocks start to fall
     from the sheer walls above them.

  O'NEILL

  CARTER
     Stand by, sir.

     Daniel is soldering a piece of wire in order to
     create smoke. The smoke trails upward, showing the
     location of the hull breach.

  CARTER
     That's it.

  ANNOTATION
     There are more thumps and more hissing.

  DANIEL
     And now there's two more.


LOCATION--SURFACE OF ASTEROID

  O'NEILL
     Carter, Daniel, this is O'Neill, please respond.
     Carter!

  ANNOTATION
     They crest a small rise and see the ship sitting
     on the surface. They look very worried.

  TEAL'C
     It appears the meteor storm has subsided.

  ANNOTATION
     They lower their protective visors.

  O'NEILL
     Go!

  ANNOTATION
     They jog to the ship and open the outer airlock
     door.

  O'NEILL

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c closes the outer door as they life their

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill, these readings indicate zero atmosphere
     within the ship.

  O'NEILL
     Hull breach?

  TEAL'C
     If that is indeed the case, Major Carter and
     Daniel Daniel could not have survived.

  O'NEILL
     Open it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods and presses buttons to open the inner
     door.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     They search the ship. Teal'c goes to the bridge of
     the ship and O'Neill to the cargo area. Teal'c
     brings up a schematic of the ship. O'Neill joins
     him on the bridge.

  O'NEILL
     I got nothing, Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     The hull has been damaged in several places.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks around the bridge area and begins to
     head purposefully to the wall where the evacuation
     pods sit.

  TEAL'C
     What are you considering, O'Neill?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pounds his boot against an evacuation pod
     three times, then puts his hand on it and feels as
     well as hears three responding thumps.

  O'NEILL
     They're in the escape pods!

  TEAL'C
     I have identified the breeched areas of the hull.
     We can begin repairs immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pounds his boot twice on a pod and
     feel/hears two thumps back before turning away.

  O'NEILL
     All right.


LOCATION--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser approaches and knocks on the door jamb.

  FRAISER
     General?

  HAMMOND
     Doctor? Shouldn't you be off world by now?

  FRAISER
     I'm leaving with the next group, sir. Your name
     isn't on the list, sir.

  HAMMOND
     That's correct.

  FRAISER
     May I ask why?

  HAMMOND
     If that asteroid hits, the only chance for
     survival of the human race will rest with the
     Alpha site. We limited their number because they
     will have limited resources. Everyone will have to
     contribute.

  FRAISER
     (shakes head) Your experience makes you more than
     qualified, sir.

  HAMMOND
     (smiles, chuckles and looks down) I appreciate
     what you're trying to do, Doctor, but my decision
     is final.

  FRAISER
     Yes, sir.

     O'Neill is back in BDU's, pushing buttons to open
     the pods. He releases Daniel first then Carter.
     They take deep breaths and Carter heads straight
     to the front console and sits at her laptop.

  O'NEILL
     Hey kids how you feeling?

  DANIEL
     Oh, not bad considering the circumstances.

  O'NEILL
     That's great. Let's go.

  CARTER
     Sir, I don't think we should leave just yet.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Daniel in question.

  DANIEL
     Don't look at me. Something to do with gravity or
     ...something.

  CARTER
     It's too high, sir. Or at least it's higher than
     it should be. I need to reconfigure the ships
     sensors to determine what the core is made of.

  O'NEILL
     (sighing loudly) Oh, here we go.

  CARTER
     I'm sorry, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Aww, come on! We came, we saw, we planted the
     bomb. We had a little fun with a meteor shower. We
     went home. It's a great story! (looks from Daniel
     to Teal'c) Isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks away, and Daniel tries not to look at
     him directly.

LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Carter brings up a schematic image of the
     asteroid.

  CARTER
     I was right.

  DANIEL
     This could be a problem.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  O'NEILL
     I don't wanna hear it!

  CARTER
     Sir, the asteroid's core is composed almost
     entirely of Naquadah.

  O'NEILL
     (resigned) Of course it is.

  CARTER
     It makes up about forty-five percent of the total
     mass.

  DANIEL
     Of course it does.

  TEAL'C
     Naquadah does not occur naturally in this solar
     system.

  CARTER
     Which is why I never even thought to look for it.
     Sir, this whole thing must have been a Goa'uld
     setup.

  DANIEL
     ...to circumvent the Protected Planets Treaty with
     the Asgard. It's almost unthinkable.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) What?

  CARTER
     The Goa'uld brought the asteroid here and set it
     on a collision course to make it look like a
     natural disaster.

  DANIEL
     And they knew the only way we could stop it would
     be with a nuke.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  O'NEILL
     So, what happens when that bomb goes off?

  CARTER
     Well, the explosion will be enhanced by the
     Naquadah probably to the force of a small nova.
     This close to the Earth, it would be enough to set
     the atmosphere on fire and boil the oceans.

  O'NEILL
     Okay, this was not in the movie!

  DANIEL
     And if we deactivate the bomb and the asteroid
     goes past the fail safe point, there's no turning
     back. Are you absolutely sure about this?

  CARTER
     Well, I can't be a hundred percent.

  O' NEILL
     We don't have a lot of choices here.

  DANIEL
     That's what I'm saying, we're damned if we do and
     we're damned if we don't. We need another option.

  TEAL'C
     The presence of the asteroid itself may be
     sufficient evidence of a treaty violation.

  DANIEL
     Right. The Asgard can intervene.

  CARTER
     We have no way to tell them.

  O'NEILL
     We do if you get that radio back on line. Teal'c,
     suit up.

  CARTER
     Okay, try it now.

  DANIEL
     (into radio) Stargate Command, this is SG-1. Do
     you read? Over. (pause) Nothing.

  CARTER
     I don't know what else to do. The radio is working
     short range, but there's no way the signal can
     penetrate this much solid Naquadah.

     O'Neill pushes buttons to stop the bomb after
     Teal'c removes the rock, but the countdown keeps
     going, reading just over four minutes to go.

  TEAL'C
     The bomb has yet to be deactivated.

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) I can see that, Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     Pushes buttons again with no effect.

     it to O'Neill.


LOCATION--BRIDGE OF CARGO SHIP

  CARTER
     The first thing you need to do is remove the

  CARTER
     Sorry, sir. We tried. The only way would be to
     pull the components we used to fix the
     hyper-drive. It would take hours.

  O'NEILL
     What, then?

  DANIEL
     Well we have a couple of options. Number one, we
     give up. We use what is left of power and life
     support to make it to the nearest unoccupied gate
     world. There's a small chance we'd make it. From
     there and we head to the Alpha Site.

  O'NEILL
     Number two?

  DANIEL
     We take off and hope that our radio signal can be
     picked up by the Asgard in time to inform then
     that this was a Goa'uld attack disguised as a
     natural disaster.

  CARTER
     There isn't enough time for that.

  DANIEL
     I know.

  O'NEILL
     (vaguely hopeful) Is there a number three?

  CARTER
     There's no three.

  DANIEL
     Well, maybe there is. Teal'c, you said Naquadah
     wasn't native to our solar system.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods.

  DANIEL
     Now, which means that the Goa'uld must have towed
     it through hyperspace by ship.

  TEAL'C
     A mothership.

  CARTER
     Daniel, that's it!

  O'NEILL
     What's it?

  DANIEL
     (sighs) We don't have a mothership.

  CARTER
     The effect only has to last a few seconds.

  O'NEILL
     What only has to last a few seconds? What?

  CARTER
     Choice three, sir. We expand the ship's hyperspace
     field to encompass the entire asteroid. We take it
     out of normal space long enough to avoid the
     collision with Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks a bit doubtful.

  O'NEILL
     (to Daniel) Is there a four?

  CARTER
     I know it sounds farfetched, sir. And, well it is.

  O'NEILL
     You want to ride an asteroid through Earth?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  CARTER
     To the outside observer, it would disappear on one
     side and reappear on the other. The problem is it
     would take every ounce of power we've got. The
     field would have to be expanded far beyond its
     usual envelope. It could cause the engines to
     explode.

  O'NEILL
     Explode?

  CARTER
     Even if we survive the engine overload sir, we
     wouldn't be able to take off again. We'd have a
     couple of hours of life support and that's it.

  O'NEILL
     But you think this is the best shot we have at
     stopping this rock?

  CARTER
     Yes, sir. I think so.
