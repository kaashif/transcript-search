Declination sixty-one degrees, six minutes; right ascension two hours, forty-eight minutes. (listens) Well, that's impossible. (listens) Yes, I'm sure! (listens) Listen. Listen. I am not some crackpot phoning in a UFO here. I happen to be the cofounder of the Northern Susquenita County Amateur Astronomy Society, and I've been tracking this thing for three nights.
