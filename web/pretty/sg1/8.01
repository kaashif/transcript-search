<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>DANIEL: The Asgard can help him. Last time they were able to erase the Ancient knowledge from his mind before it killed him. Weir We've tried contacting them. What do you suggest we do?</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>WEIR: Colonel O'Neill was able to fend off Anubis' fleet using the weapons from the Ancient outpost. Hopefully, that will make the other Goa'uld think twice before attacking Earth in the foreseeable future. But the truth is, we don't know if we're going to be able to ever use those weapons again, and if we can't, we're going to need a new tactical advantage over the Goa'uld. At least that's what the Pentagon tells me. The modified cargo ship...it's too valuable right now. I'm sorry. Request denied.</td></tr>
