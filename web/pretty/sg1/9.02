<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>DANIEL: (holding up a finger) No. It's the second part of ancient proverb. "There is only one truth: the universe is infinite."</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>DANIEL: "There is only one truth: the universe is infinite." Therefore the statement about the treasure being in this pot has to be false. So the treasure must be in...</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel lifts the lid of the gold pot. Inside is a gold coin. Daniel and Vala, both bent at the waist due to the ever lowering ceiling, stare at the pot's contents in surprise. The ceiling quickly rises to its former height. The altar, which had also slightly lowered, also rises to its full height and the stone slab sealing the chamber lifts, revealing the exit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Uh, "U" with a square over it. Chair with a little square. Upside-down backwards "L", call that "seven." Squares unevenly stacked. That chair thing again. Big "N" and "sad face."</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>DANIEL: Uh, "reflect." It means "reflect"!</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Reflect?</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c is now on one knee, his back bracing the ceiling. Mitchell's chin is against the top of the altar, the top of his head touching the ceiling. He has his arm fully extended to reach the blocks of symbols.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>DANIEL: (concentrating) Reflect, reflect...reflect on the eightfold path. Buddhism teaches an eightfold path to enlightenment.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: As Mitchell holds one of the blocks, his thumb partially obscures the symbol, making the remainder look like the number four. He cocks his head, inspired, and repeats covering and uncovering part of the symbol.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Four.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c is now on his hands and knees. Mitchell struggles to complete the puzzle, now with a strategy in mind.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Six.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The ceiling is so low by now, Mitchell can barely see the top of the altar. He fumbles the symbols into place, still muttering. Daniel and Vala worry helplessly crouched on the other side of the sealed door. Abruptly, the rumbling noise stops.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>DANIEL: (screaming desperately) Teal'c!</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The stone slab rises. Teal'c and Mitchell are fine, crouched on the floor of the chamber as the ceiling rises. The four stand and look at each other.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (sighing in relief) Yeah, thanks. The symbols were actually the numbers 1 through 8 and their mirror image.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell passes Daniel and walks down the tunnel. Teal'c nods briefly to Daniel before following. Daniel stares after them both in wonder that they survived.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell bounds into the main chamber. He's already practically at the sword in the stone by the time the others enter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>MITCHELL: All right, we passed the tests. So this should work.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell studies the sword for a moment, then reaches and lifts it out of the stone in one fluid gesture. The blade is long and gleaming silver. Mitchell turns to the others, holding the sword and looking pleased. Behind him an amour-clad knight with a sword appears. Vala and Daniel are both wary, and Teal'c aims his weapon. Mitchell turns to see what's got their attention. The knight lifts his sword into an attack position. Mitchell counters by holding his sword at ready.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (muttering) Should've known it wouldn't be that easy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The knight strikes out, and Mitchell blocks the blow with his sword. The impact knocks Mitchell back with a cry, and he staggers down the steps. He ends up backing away, near the others. Daniel readies his weapon, as does Teal'c, but they both hesitate to fire. The knight begins fighting Mitchell in earnest with his sword.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Weird.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell and the Knight trade blows back and forth. During a pause, Mitchell steps close to Daniel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>DANIEL: (surprised at Mitchell's success) You, uh, you done this before?</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Uh, fight a knight in armor? No, can't say that I have.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>DANIEL: Well, you're doing good.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Heh. Took a little fencing in college.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The knight and Mitchell trade blows at a faster pace. Each time their swords meet, a flash of light erupts at the impact site. Eventually they lock swords then break apart. Mitchell dives below a wide swing of the knight's sword.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Okay, I could use a little help.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell backs away, and Teal'c has a clear shot. He fires his weapon, but the bullets merely pass through the knight, though its image shows the impacts for a moment as a green glow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>TEAL'C: It appears to be a hologram.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (turns to Teal'c and leans on his sword, incredulous) A hologram?</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The knight strikes while Mitchell is facing Teal'c, forcing Mitchell to his knees with a grunt. A green glowing light momentarily appears on his back where he was hit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (in intense pain) Jeez.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>VALA: (studying his back) I don't think it actually cut you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (hoarse from pain) Well, it hurt like hell.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell quickly stands and blocks two more blows from the knight before it strikes his upper right arm, sending him to his knees again and making him drop the sword, groaning.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>VALA: (to Daniel) I don't know. I don't think he's actually that good.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>MITCHELL: Okay, so I flunked fencing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell blocks a few more blows while getting to his feet. He only stands for a few moments before the knight once again breaks through his defenses and strikes Mitchell on his left leg. Mitchell collapses with a cry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Colonel Mitchell, the sword.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell throws the sword to Teal'c. It passes right through Teal'c as he tries to catch it, falling on the floor behind him with a clatter. Mitchell rolls to avoid a strike by the knight and stumbles over to the sword. He grabs it just as the knight strikes again, knocking Mitchell off his feet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>VALA: Okay, that thing is going to kill him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>DANIEL: Everybody get to the rings!</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c pulls Mitchell upright by his vest. Sweat pours from Mitchell's forehead as he tries to focus.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell remembers his F-302 being hit by enemy fire, its crash, and being stuck in the wreckage. He also remembers the hospital, the nurse checking his iv, the doctor and nurse working to save his life, and a physical therapy session. In this last memory, Mitchell is in a full neck brace that extends down his chest. He holds onto parallel bars in a physical therapy room, but cannot support his own weight and falls. The physical therapist by his side tries to help him upright.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>THERAPIST: Okay, that's enough for today.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (fighting her) No. I can do this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He pushes the therapist away.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--MAIN CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES</td></tr>
<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell pushes Teal'c away in the same manner as he did the therapist. He stands and once again fights the knight. This time he's able to gain the upper hand and breaks through the knight's defenses twice in quick succession. Mitchell's blade leaves a glowing trail as he swings it. He drives his sword through the knight's chest, holding the blade there for several seconds before pulling it out again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>VALA: Yeah!</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell swings again and cleaves through the knight. The knight staggers and the hologram disappears. Mitchell collapses onto his back.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>MITCHELL: (exhausted but noting the lack of reaction by the cave to his victory) Oh, come on. That's got to be it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Teal'c helps Mitchell to his feet. Though upright, Mitchell still uses the sword as a crutch and is breathing heavily.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>VALA: I don't understand, we solved the riddles. (gesturing between Daniel and Mitchell) Well, he solved one and he solved one, and he won the fight.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>MITCHELL: And what? Nothing?</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>DANIEL: But you're the only one who defeated the knight. That sword was obviously designed to sense whoever pulled it from the stone. (indicating himself, Vala, and Tealc') What if there are sensors detecting us?</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>TEAL'C: Are you suggesting that we should leave?</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>MITCHELL: All right.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell staggers to the wall of the cave and leans the sword against the wall. The others position themselves within the ring parameters.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>DANIEL: (to Mitchell) If nothing happens, just...join us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell activates the rings. As soon as the three ring out of the cave, an earthquake starts. Mitchell cries out in alarm and frantically turns back to the ring controls.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--PROMETHEUS RING ROOM</td></tr>
<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel, Teal'c, and Vala are in the room. Rings activate and Mitchell appears, his hands covering his head and dust falling around him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>DANIEL: What happened?</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>MITCHELL: That whole place is collapsing. We must have done something wrong.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>VALA: (turning to face them) What?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--AVALON CAVES</td></tr>
<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Ring transport activates, and Mitchell arrives. Large chunks of the ceiling have already fallen. Mitchell stumbles and runs down the tunnel to the chamber where Daniel solved the riddle of the pots. Once there, he hesitates as to which pot to put the coin in, then chooses the gold pot. He drops the coin inside and replaces the lid. As soon as the lid seals the pot, the rumbling stops and the caves stabilize.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Mitchell returns to the still empty main chamber. Sighing at the lack of treasure, he begins to activate the rings, then pauses and looks at the sword leaning against a wall. He picks up the sword returns it to the stone, sliding it easily into the rock. Once the sword is replaced, the chamber fills with gold urns, vases, statues, goblets, coins, jewels and other treasures.</td></tr>

Mitchell approaches Daniel, who sits in a corner by a large treasure chest paging through a large book.</td></tr>
