Avalon Part 2
TEASER

LOCATION--DANIEL AND VALA'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     The ceiling of the chamber continues to lower.
     Daniel and Vala are crouched on opposite sides of
     the stone altar. Daniel is holding his P-90 in one
     hand, using its attached flashlight to illuminate
     the area.

  VALA
     Think! You are the expert on all things Ancient.

  DANIEL
     (sarcastically) Yeah, you didn't care about that
     two minutes ago. "Let's try this one. How about
     this one?"

  VALA
     (panicking) So think!

  DANIEL
     I'm thinking!

  VALA
     Sorry, but could you possibly think a little bit
     faster!

  DANIEL
     "The universe is infinite."

  VALA
     No doubt it's deliberately ironic that we're in an
     ever decreasing space!

  DANIEL
     (holding up a finger) No. It's the second part of
     ancient proverb. "There is only one truth: the
     universe is infinite."

  VALA
     How does that help us!?!

  DANIEL
     "There is only one truth..." This pot says: "The
     treasure's in this pot."

  VALA
     It's not in either of them.

  DANIEL
     I know, we did it wrong. So we have to see if we
     can do it again.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala replace the lids on both pots.

  DANIEL
     "There is only one truth: the universe is
     infinite." Therefore the statement about the
     treasure being in this pot has to be false. So the
     treasure must be in...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel lifts the lid of the gold pot. Inside is a
     gold coin. Daniel and Vala, both bent at the waist
     due to the ever lowering ceiling, stare at the
     pot's contents in surprise. The ceiling quickly
     rises to its former height. The altar, which had
     also slightly lowered, also rises to its full
     height and the stone slab sealing the chamber
     lifts, revealing the exit.

  VALA
     Wow. Good thing you know your ancient proverbs,
     otherwise we'd be... (suddenly realizing)
     Mitchell.

  DANIEL
     (very concerned) Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel drops the pot's lid and rushes out of the
     chamber. Vala stays behind for a moment, staring
     down toward the gold pot and biting her lip.


LOCATION--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     The ceiling of the chamber continues to lower.
     Teal'c is hunched down, straining with the effort
     of fruitlessly pushing against it with his back.
     Mitchell is on one knee and continues to try
     random combinations of symbols to solve the
     Ancient puzzle.

  MITCHELL
     (yelling) Yo! Feel free to jump in here at
     anytime!


LOCATION--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER AND VICINITY, AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel runs down the tunnel and reaches the sealed
     entrance to the chamber where Teal'c and Mitchell
     are trapped. A few seconds later, Vala joins him.
     Daniel crouches by the slab; there is a small
     space between the floor and the bottom of the
     slab.

  DANIEL
     (yelling through the space) Teal'c!?


LOCATION--TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson!

  MITCHELL
     Hey! We got a little problem in here!


LOCATION--OUTSIDE TEAL'C AND MITCHELL'S CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  DANIEL
     Uh, what's the puzzle?

  ANNOTATION
     Following scenes switch rapidly between the
     interior of the cave where Teal'c and Mitchell are
     trapped and just outside the door, where Daniel
     attempts to help as Vala looks on.

  MITCHELL
     There's eight stones with symbols on them and some
     Ancient writing. I think--

  DANIEL
     Describe the writing!

  MITCHELL
     Uh, "U" with a square over it. Chair with a little
     square. Upside-down backwards "L", call that
     "seven." Squares unevenly stacked. That chair
     thing again. Big "N" and "sad face."

  DANIEL
     Uh, "reflect." It means "reflect"!

  MITCHELL
     Reflect?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is now on one knee, his back bracing the
     ceiling. Mitchell's chin is against the top of the
     altar, the top of his head touching the ceiling.
     He has his arm fully extended to reach the blocks
     of symbols.

  DANIEL
     (concentrating) Reflect, reflect...reflect on the
     eightfold path. Buddhism teaches an eightfold path
     to enlightenment.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, that tells me exactly NOTHING!

  DANIEL
     (in despair) I'm sorry. I can't help if I can't
     see the symbols of the stones you're supposed to
     put in order.

  MITCHELL
     (muttering to himself, annoyed) Reflect.. "reflect
     on the eightfold path." "Reflect on the eight."

  ANNOTATION
     As Mitchell holds one of the blocks, his thumb
     partially obscures the symbol, making the
     remainder look like the number four. He cocks his
     head, inspired, and repeats covering and
     uncovering part of the symbol.

  MITCHELL
     Four.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is now on his hands and knees. Mitchell
     struggles to complete the puzzle, now with a
     strategy in mind.

  MITCHELL
     Six.

  ANNOTATION
     The ceiling is so low by now, Mitchell can barely
     see the top of the altar. He fumbles the symbols
     into place, still muttering. Daniel and Vala worry
     helplessly crouched on the other side of the
     sealed door. Abruptly, the rumbling noise stops.

  DANIEL
     (screaming desperately) Teal'c!

  VALA
     (quietly reassuring) Look, I didn't hear any
     screaming or squishing sounds, so--

  ANNOTATION
     The stone slab rises. Teal'c and Mitchell are
     fine, crouched on the floor of the chamber as the
     ceiling rises. The four stand and look at each
     other.

  DANIEL
     (shocked and relieved) You did it...

  MITCHELL
     (sighing in relief) Yeah, thanks. The symbols were
     actually the numbers 1 through 8 and their mirror
     image.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell passes Daniel and walks down the tunnel.
     Teal'c nods briefly to Daniel before following.
     Daniel stares after them both in wonder that they
     survived.


LOCATION--MAIN CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell bounds into the main chamber. He's
     already practically at the sword in the stone by
     the time the others enter.

  MITCHELL
     All right, we passed the tests. So this should
     work.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell studies the sword for a moment, then
     reaches and lifts it out of the stone in one fluid
     gesture. The blade is long and gleaming silver.
     Mitchell turns to the others, holding the sword
     and looking pleased. Behind him an amour-clad
     knight with a sword appears. Vala and Daniel are
     both wary, and Teal'c aims his weapon. Mitchell
     turns to see what's got their attention. The
     knight lifts his sword into an attack position.
     Mitchell counters by holding his sword at ready.

  MITCHELL
     (muttering) Should've known it wouldn't be that
     easy.

  ANNOTATION
     The knight strikes out, and Mitchell blocks the
     blow with his sword. The impact knocks Mitchell
     back with a cry, and he staggers down the steps.
     He ends up backing away, near the others. Daniel
     readies his weapon, as does Teal'c, but they both
     hesitate to fire. The knight begins fighting
     Mitchell in earnest with his sword.

  MITCHELL
     Weird.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and the Knight trade blows back and
     forth. During a pause, Mitchell steps close to
     Daniel.

  DANIEL
     (surprised at Mitchell's success) You, uh, you
     done this before?

  MITCHELL
     Uh, fight a knight in armor? No, can't say that I
     have.

  DANIEL
     Well, you're doing good.

  MITCHELL
     Heh. Took a little fencing in college.

  ANNOTATION
     The knight and Mitchell trade blows at a faster
     pace. Each time their swords meet, a flash of
     light erupts at the impact site. Eventually they
     lock swords then break apart. Mitchell dives below
     a wide swing of the knight's sword.

  MITCHELL
     Okay, I could use a little help.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell backs away, and Teal'c has a clear shot.
     He fires his weapon, but the bullets merely pass
     through the knight, though its image shows the
     impacts for a moment as a green glow.

  TEAL'C
     It appears to be a hologram.

  MITCHELL
     (turns to Teal'c and leans on his sword,
     incredulous) A hologram?

  ANNOTATION
     The knight strikes while Mitchell is facing
     Teal'c, forcing Mitchell to his knees with a
     grunt. A green glowing light momentarily appears
     on his back where he was hit.

  MITCHELL
     (in intense pain) Jeez.

  VALA
     (studying his back) I don't think it actually cut
     you.

  MITCHELL
     (hoarse from pain) Well, it hurt like hell.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell quickly stands and blocks two more blows
     from the knight before it strikes his upper right
     arm, sending him to his knees again and making him
     drop the sword, groaning.

  VALA
     (to Daniel) I don't know. I don't think he's
     actually that good.

  MITCHELL
     Okay, so I flunked fencing.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell blocks a few more blows while getting to
     his feet. He only stands for a few moments before
     the knight once again breaks through his defenses
     and strikes Mitchell on his left leg. Mitchell
     collapses with a cry.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Mitchell, the sword.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell throws the sword to Teal'c. It passes
     right through Teal'c as he tries to catch it,
     falling on the floor behind him with a clatter.
     Mitchell rolls to avoid a strike by the knight and
     stumbles over to the sword. He grabs it just as
     the knight strikes again, knocking Mitchell off
     his feet.

  VALA
     Okay, that thing is going to kill him.

  DANIEL
     Everybody get to the rings!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c pulls Mitchell upright by his vest. Sweat
     pours from Mitchell's forehead as he tries to
     focus.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell remembers his F-302 being hit by enemy
     fire, its crash, and being stuck in the wreckage.
     He also remembers the hospital, the nurse checking
     his iv, the doctor and nurse working to save his
     life, and a physical therapy session. In this last
     memory, Mitchell is in a full neck brace that
     extends down his chest. He holds onto parallel
     bars in a physical therapy room, but cannot
     support his own weight and falls. The physical
     therapist by his side tries to help him upright.

  THERAPIST
     Okay, that's enough for today.

  MITCHELL
     (fighting her) No. I can do this.

  ANNOTATION
     He pushes the therapist away.

  END FLASHBACKS



LOCATION--MAIN CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell pushes Teal'c away in the same manner as
     he did the therapist. He stands and once again
     fights the knight. This time he's able to gain the
     upper hand and breaks through the knight's
     defenses twice in quick succession. Mitchell's
     blade leaves a glowing trail as he swings it. He
     drives his sword through the knight's chest,
     holding the blade there for several seconds before
     pulling it out again.

  VALA
     Yeah!

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell swings again and cleaves through the
     knight. The knight staggers and the hologram
     disappears. Mitchell collapses onto his back.

  MITCHELL
     (exhausted but noting the lack of reaction by the
     cave to his victory) Oh, come on. That's got to be
     it.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c helps Mitchell to his feet. Though upright,
     Mitchell still uses the sword as a crutch and is
     breathing heavily.

  VALA
     I don't understand, we solved the riddles.
     (gesturing between Daniel and Mitchell) Well, he
     solved one and he solved one, and he won the
     fight.

  MITCHELL
     And what? Nothing?

  DANIEL
     But you're the only one who defeated the knight.
     That sword was obviously designed to sense whoever
     pulled it from the stone. (indicating himself,
     Vala, and Tealc') What if there are sensors
     detecting us?

  TEAL'C
     Are you suggesting that we should leave?

  DANIEL
     It's worth a try.

  MITCHELL
     All right.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell staggers to the wall of the cave and
     leans the sword against the wall. The others
     position themselves within the ring parameters.

  DANIEL
     (to Mitchell) If nothing happens, just...join us.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell activates the rings. As soon as the three
     ring out of the cave, an earthquake starts.
     Mitchell cries out in alarm and frantically turns
     back to the ring controls.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS RING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Teal'c, and Vala are in the room. Rings
     activate and Mitchell appears, his hands covering
     his head and dust falling around him.

  DANIEL
     What happened?

  MITCHELL
     That whole place is collapsing. We must have done
     something wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala turns away from the others. They all look
     towards her.

  DANIEL
     (to Vala) What'd you take?

  VALA
     (turning to face them) What?

  DANIEL
     (approaching Vala) "Truth of spirit."

  VALA
     I resent--

  DANIEL
     "Truth of spirit." What'd you take?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala reaches into the bodice of her outfit and
     pulls out the coin from the puzzle Daniel solved.


LOCATION--AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     Ring transport activates, and Mitchell arrives.
     Large chunks of the ceiling have already fallen.
     Mitchell stumbles and runs down the tunnel to the
     chamber where Daniel solved the riddle of the
     pots. Once there, he hesitates as to which pot to
     put the coin in, then chooses the gold pot. He
     drops the coin inside and replaces the lid. As
     soon as the lid seals the pot, the rumbling stops
     and the caves stabilize.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell returns to the still empty main chamber.
     Sighing at the lack of treasure, he begins to
     activate the rings, then pauses and looks at the
     sword leaning against a wall. He picks up the
     sword returns it to the stone, sliding it easily
     into the rock. Once the sword is replaced, the
     chamber fills with gold urns, vases, statues,
     goblets, coins, jewels and other treasures.

  MITCHELL
     (looking around) Worth it.


LOCATION--MAIN CHAMBER, AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     Prometheus crew members sort and inventory the
     various riches in the chamber. Vala, wearing a
     silver tiara, lounges on a pile of treasure,
     pouring a trophy full of coins and jewels over her
     body. Mitchell approaches Daniel, who sits in a
     corner by a large treasure chest paging through a
     large book.

  MITCHELL
     (observing Vala) We are not going to let her keep
     that, are we?

  DANIEL
     (glancing at Vala) No.

  MITCHELL
     Good.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala hears their conversation and pouts.

  MITCHELL
     Well that figures. Room full of gold and jewels,
     and Dr. Daniel Jackson finds the one book. So,
     what's it about?

  DANIEL
     Actually, it's a story. It's written like fiction.

  MITCHELL
     "Once upon a time..."

  DANIEL
     Once upon a time, there was a race of people that
     went on a great journey through space, across the
     universe. They were called the Altera. After much
     time...

  ANNOTATION
     Vala plucks coins out of her bodice and sulks.
     Teal'c crouches, half-listening to the story.

  DANIEL
     (continuing) ...and I think this means thousands
     of years, they found a great belt of stars.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel falls silent.

  MITCHELL
     ...and they lived happily ever after.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel continues to read silently. Something in
     the book grabs his attention, and he stands.

  TEAL'C
     (noticing Daniel's movement) Have you found
     something, Daniel Jackson?

  DANIEL
     It says that the Alterans named their new home
     "Avalon," and that they built many Astria Porta.

  MITCHELL
     Stargates?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  VALA
     The Ancients built the Stargates.

  DANIEL
     Well, it stands to reason they weren't always
     called "the Ancients."

  MITCHELL
     (to Vala) What do you care? You got your treasure.

  VALA
     Hmm. Let's see what's of more value--A few gold
     trinkets that apparently I won't be allowed to
     keep... (tosses a necklace over her shoulder)
     or...previously undiscovered secrets about the
     Gate Builders, the most powerful race to ever
     inhabit the galaxy.

  DANIEL
     You realize what this could mean.

  MITCHELL
     Whoa. We've always presumed that the Ancients were
     the first evolution of humans in this galaxy. But,
     but this...this is the first evidence suggesting
     they came here long ago from somewhere far, far
     away.

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Marks brushes some gold trinkets away from a
     large, black, domed device with a blue crystal
     adorning its top.

  MARKS
     Colonel Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell, Vala, and Daniel turn to Marks. Teal'c
     approaches and studies the alien device.

  MITCHELL
     (grinning) Heh. One of these things is not like
     the others.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Landry, Daniel, Vala, and Mitchell come out of a
     room and walk down the corridor. Daniel is in the
     middle of trying to convince Landry of his
     position.

  DANIEL
     (sighing) It's much, much more than that. We know
     the Ancients left our galaxy for Pegasus and
     returned later when they lost the war to the
     Wraith, but what happened to them?

  LANDRY
     I thought they ascended.

  DANIEL
     Some did, that we know of. But what if the others
     went home? Even if they didn't, the book I read
     suggested that the Alterans left a civilization
     behind.

  LANDRY
     And your point is?

  DANIEL
     My point is that we haven't met a single, living
     Ancient who was willing to share their knowledge
     freely with us, and there could be an entire
     advanced civilization of them out there somewhere
     in another galaxy! I mean, isn't that why we're
     doing this, all of this? The Stargate program, the
     budget? Isn't it so we can go out and meet new
     races? Gather advanced technology? Possibly learn
     about ourselves in the process?

  VALA
     Oh, come on. You do it to meet women.

  MITCHELL
     She has a point, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They approach the Level 28 elevator and slowly
     enter it.

  LANDRY
     I've been thinking I need to get out on an
     off-world mission or two.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, just to get the feel for it.

  LANDRY
     "Always do everything you ask of those you
     command."

  MITCHELL
     Patton.

  LANDRY
     Very good.

  MITCHELL
     Good movie.

  ANNOTATION
     The elevator doors close.


LOCATION--ELEVATOR

  DANIEL
     (irritated) Laugh if you want to, but I believe
     finding these Alterans and where they came from
     should be our top priority from this point
     forward. They are "the Gate Builders."

  LANDRY
     Nobody's laughing, Dr. Jackson. The universe is a
     big place. Tell me where they are and how to get
     there, and I'll order you to go.

  ANNOTATION
     Elevator doors open, and Landry exits, the others
     following behind him.

  DANIEL
     (taken aback at Landry's response) I'm not saying
     this is going to be easy. I mean, if they're from
     a distant galaxy, our network of Stargates might
     not even connect. And even if it does, we know the
     massive power requirements necessary to dial
     Pegasus, and they're relatively close, in
     intergalactic terms. But on the bright side,
     according to the text we found in the Glastonbury
     cavern, the Ancient device we discovered may be
     capable of intergalactic communication.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry stops in front of the closed door to his
     office.

  LANDRY
     Thank you, Doctor Jackson. I'm sure you'll keep me
     posted. Colonel.

  MITCHELL
     General.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry opens the door and enters his office,
     shutting it as Daniel steps forward, about to make
     another point.

  MITCHELL
     He has no idea what you just said.

  ANNOTATION
     The door reopens and Landry steps back out.
     Mitchell stands at attention.

  LANDRY
     (referring to Vala) Someone want to tell me why
     she's still on my base? ...And, uh, yes, I did.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry reenters his office and shuts the door.

  VALA
     Well, I think it's incredible.


LOCATION--TEMPLE ON DAKARA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     There is evidence of new construction in the form
     of scaffolding. In the distance, an Al'kesh is
     hauling a large load slung beneath it.


LOCATION--HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBERS, DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     Rak'nor and Teal'c are walking through a corridor.
     Teal'c is still in his SGC uniform.

  RAK'NOR
     The Jaffa of the Onac ka equal as many as all the
     other regional coalitions. And they strongly
     support Gerak.

  TEAL'C
     Of this I am aware.

  RAK'NOR
     If we allow them even one more vote based on
     unconfirmed military strength, the council will be
     in Gerak's hands. Until proper inspections--

  TEAL'C
     (interrupting) Rak'nor!

  RAK'NOR
     I'm sorry. We are all working very hard. It just
     seems as though Gerak is winning.

  TEAL'C
     Bra'tac and Rya'c are negotiating with coalitions
     who have yet to declare their allegiance.

  RAK'NOR
     I did not fight for the freedom of all Jaffa only
     to have it corrupted by a few power-hungry
     individuals.

  TEAL'C
     Nor did I.

  RAK'NOR
     I just do not understand why you have chosen to
     spend so much time with the Tau'ri at such a
     critical stage.

  TEAL'C
     (becoming angry) My friends from the Tau'ri are
     largely responsible for the Jaffa being free, and
     as thanks they have been treated with mistrust and
     disrespect. Until all Jaffa see that the old ways
     are not the future, I will do whatever I need to
     do to enlighten them.

  RAK'NOR
     And how does chasing ancient history do that?

  TEAL'C
     Ancient knowledge is what defeated the Goa'uld and
     the Replicators, and I believe that one day it
     will unite the Jaffa in a nation of peace. I will
     prove it.

  RAK'NOR
     I hope so.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE, DAY


LOCATION--SGC SCIENCE LAB ONE

  ANNOTATION
     The black domed device is in the lab, surrounded
     by scientific equipment. Lee is bent over the
     device. Daniel and Vala are arguing. Mitchell
     stands nearby.

  VALA
     I have been around the galaxy long enough to know
     that knowledge is power, and understanding the
     technology that was left behind by the Ancients is
     the most powerful knowledge around.

  DANIEL
     (holding out his braceleted right wrist) And if
     you think I'm going to stay linked with you for
     the rest of my natural--

  MITCHELL
     (interrupting) Focus! Maybe we should focus on the
     task at hand.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell points over to the device, and the three
     join Lee around it.

  LEE
     Yeah, well, the device obviously has a power
     source, and, uh, I don't think it's been depleted.

  DANIEL
     Okay, when I read this was a communication device,
     I realized that the shape of these recessed spaces
     looked familiar.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up a small, black stone.

  DANIEL
     These stones are actually an Ancient form of
     communication device that links the users
     psychically, allowing them to see through each
     other's eyes. It appears that they're actually
     meant to be used in conjunction with this
     terminal.

  MITCHELL
     So what happens when you attach the stones?

  DANIEL
     We're going to find out.

  LEE
     These stones were originally set for General
     O'Neill and one Joe Spencer.

  DANIEL
     Barber from Indiana.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, weird guy. I read the file.

  LEE
     Well, anyway, after a lot of tedious, although, I
     must say, ultimately very brilliant work if I do
     say so myself,... (Daniel places his hand on Lee's
     shoulder to stop his tangent) ...I was able to
     reset the stones.

  MITCHELL
     Don't they have to be activated by someone with
     the Ancient gene? Same file.

  LEE
     Well, that's what we thought at first, but no,
     like a lot of Ancient technology, the stones
     actually just need to be initialized.

  MITCHELL
     By someone with the gene. That's a guess.

  LEE
     No, you're right. Which these obviously have been.

  MITCHELL
     So any one of us can take the pony ride.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, and I figured that was going to be me. I
     mean, I did miss the Daedalus for this, so...

  MITCHELL
     You're going to dine out on that for a while?

  DANIEL
     (nodding) Yeah, yeah. Like you wouldn't believe.

  MITCHELL
     Well, no one's going to make an argument against
     that. You are the world's "foremost" expert on the
     Ancients. (makes quote mark notations with his
     hands) But we got two stones.

  VALA
     Yes, and this one's mine. Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala grabs the other stone from the counter.

  MITCHELL
     Excuse me, how do you figure that?

  VALA
     Well, Daniel and I are linked.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala leans her arm on Daniel's shoulder.

  DANIEL
     If I could just point out, for the record, we
     don't have to be.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel removes her arm.

  VALA
     He's only guessing that this device is for
     communication. What if it's a transporter of some
     kind, and he gets whisked away and can't get back?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel rolls his eyes and mumbles inaudibly to
     himself.

  LEE
     Actually, we have done a fair bit of research on
     this device, and I can say with absolute-- (pauses
     at the looks everyone gives him)
     ...relative...certainty...oh for... Look we have
     studied devices like this for years, and at some
     point ultimately you just have to turn it on.

  DANIEL
     I'm going to give it a try.

  VALA
     Where he goes, I go.

  DANIEL
     I'm not going anywhere.

  VALA
     So he thinks.

  DANIEL
     (sniping through gritted teeth) It's a
     communication device.

  LEE
     I'm going to watch from the observation room.

  MITCHELL
     All right. Good luck.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee and Mitchell go to the adjoining observation
     room, where they can see the science lab through
     full length glass windows.

  VALA
     So, what do we do?

  DANIEL
     Well, I'm guessing we just put these two stones
     any two of these spots.

  VALA
     Any two?

  DANIEL
     Well, there aren't any markings to indicate
     otherwise, so any two. And...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala place the stones in random slots
     of the device. Vala winces in anticipation.
     Nothing happens for a second, then the blue
     crystal at the top of the dome lights up. Vala and
     Daniel pass out and drop straight to the floor.

  MITCHELL
     (calling on phone from observation room) Med team
     to Science Lab One.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Stars and planets pass by until a large planet
     looms.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala stand in separate areas of the
     main room of a small, rustic residence. There are
     various bottles on a table and dried herbs hanging
     from the ceiling. Both are dressed in clothing
     reminiscent of the Renaissance era, Vala in a
     long-sleeved dress and headband and Daniel in a
     tunic, over-shirt and leggings. Daniel is not
     wearing his glasses.

  DANIEL
     (appearing as Harrid) Hello. Please, don't be
     afraid. My name is Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala turns to Daniel and sees Harrid, a lanky
     young man. Daniel sees Vala as Sallis, a blond
     young woman.

  VALA
     (appearing as Sallis) It's me, Vala.

  DANIEL
     (appearing as Harrid) Okay. Not a transporter.

  VALA
     (appearing as Sallis, smiling) Where are we?

  DANIEL
     I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala circle the room, both coming to
     stand before a mirror. They look at their
     reflections, which display Harrid and Sallis.

  DANIEL
     But I think we're in them.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala are lying on gurneys in hospital
     gowns, connected to medical equipment. The dome is
     in a corner. Lam, Lee, and other staff are in full
     hazmat gear. Mitchell and Teal'c watch from the
     observation room.

  LAM
     Blood pressure and heart rate are normal. Pupils
     are slightly dilated. Now, we're sure this is
     because of the device? They also passed out before
     when they were separated because of the bracelets.

  LEE
     The reaction was virtually instantaneous after the
     device was activated. Anyway, there's no
     discernable energy rays and no measurable
     radiation being emitted, so...

  LAM
     And we've found no contagions. All right.

  ANNOTATION
     Lam removes the helmet of her hazmat suit and
     turns to the observation room.

  LAM
     I want to get an EEG going, but my first
     impression here is that they're in some kind of
     sleep state.

  MITCHELL
     (through microphone) Maybe we should disconnect
     the stones.

  LEE
     (removing his hazmat helmet) Uh, for all we know,
     this could be perfectly normal. I mean this could
     be the way the device actually works.

  LAM
     And could you give me some time here before we go
     messing around with that thing anymore?

  LEE
     I wouldn't call it "messing around."

  LAM
     Look, for all we know, disconnecting the stones
     could put them in further jeopardy.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY OBSERVATION ROOM

  MITCHELL
     So, how are things on Dakara?

  TEAL'C
     About as well as here.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala explore the main room, looking for
     any clues about the people they look like and
     where they are.

  VALA
     I don't understand. This is an odd communication
     device. I mean, I can't talk to this poor woman. I
     have no access to her mind, her thoughts, her
     memories. I'm just inside of her looking out
     through her eyes.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, Jack and Joe Spencer described the
     experience as having visions of what was happening
     to the other.

  VALA
     Were they ever in total control of each other's
     bodies?

  DANIEL
     No, but they weren't using the stones in
     conjunction with the Ancient terminal either. It's
     possible it was meant to work this way so that we
     can communicate with others without intruding on
     the minds of those we're connected to. They're
     just...temporary transmitters.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala studies her reflection again.

  VALA
     (appearing as Sallis) Do you think we're actually
     in another galaxy?

  DANIEL
     I don't know.

  VALA
     Why these people?

  DANIEL
     (reading a plaque on the wall) I don't know.

  VALA
     Well, maybe it's just me, but this
     house...these...clothes. We don't look the way I'd
     expect the Ancients to look.

  DANIEL
     No.

  VALA
     What do you suppose their names are?

  DANIEL
     Harrid and Sallis.

  VALA
     How do you know that?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gestures to the plaque.

  DANIEL
     Well because it, um, says so right here. (reading
     the plaque) It says: "This is
     the...(mumbles)...home of Harrid and Sallis
     Cicera."

  VALA
     Wait, I missed that. You-you mumbled it.

  DANIEL
     No, I didn't.

  VALA
     Well, you said something that I couldn't
     understand.

  DANIEL
     Well, I didn't say it because I don't really know
     what it means. So I don't have to say it out loud
     in case I...know what it means.

  VALA
     Well, go on.

  DANIEL
     (reluctantly) Nuptial. It means nuptial.

  VALA
     As in we're...

  DANIEL
     Married, yeah. Let's go look outside.


LOCATION--VILLAGE OF VER AGER, DAWN

  ANNOTATION
     Vala and Daniel exit the house to enter a village.
     Everyone is dressed similarly to them. There are
     small market stands, and men pulling wooden carts.
     It appears a fairly primitive society.

  VALA
     Not quite what I imagined when I pictured a
     civilization of gate builders.

  DANIEL
     No. Something tells me this is not the same people
     who built a spaceship capable of traveling across
     the universe.

  MALE VILLAGER
     Above the sun! Harrid! Sallis!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala look up to see a young couple
     waving to them from a second story walkway.

  VALA
     (to Daniel) What?

  DANIEL
     Uh, I think that means good morning.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel cautiously smiles and nods. The couple nod
     back.

  DANIEL
     (appearing as Harrid, waving) Above the sun to
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala adopt vacant fake smiles.

  VALA
     (low to Daniel, still smiling) "Above the sun?"

  DANIEL
     (low to Vala) I think he's speaking Ancient. I
     think the communicator's translating for us.

  VALA
     I couldn't read the sign.

  DANIEL
     Maybe it only works for spoken language.

  VILLAGER
     See you at prostration.

  DANIEL
     (calling upwards and waving) Prostration it is.

  VALA
     (calling upwards) Prostration it is.

  ANNOTATION
     The couple give Daniel and Vala a strange look,
     then wave and leave. Vala leans up against Daniel,
     who puts his arm around her, trying to appear like
     a young, married couple.

  VALA
     So what do you want to do, Harrid? Or is it
     Sallis?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes Vala by the shoulders, and pulls her
     back from him slightly.

  DANIEL
     (with fake smile) People are starting to stare.

  VALA
     Well, should we walk about and try to appear
     normal? Hmm?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel places Vala's arm in his, patting her hand.
     They stroll through the square.

  DANIEL
     Nope, not what I was expecting at all.

  VALA
     Me neither.

  DANIEL
     On the bright side, I think he was looking at me
     when he said "Harrid."

  VALA
     Please, he was staring at me the whole time.


LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Lam knocks at the open door. Landry turns toward
     her.

  LANDRY
     Hey! Come in. Now, I can't decide if I like the
     desk here.

  LAM
     Where else are you going to put it, out in the
     hall?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry chuckles.

  LAM
     Daniel and Vala are stable. Based on rapid eye
     movements and brain wave patterns, I'm guessing
     it's actually some kind of induced dream-like
     condition.

  LANDRY
     Dr. Jackson believes the device was used for
     long-range communication. Is it possible that's
     what they're doing? Talking to someone
     somewhere...out there?

  LAM
     I don't know.

  LANDRY
     (hopeful, gesturing for her to join him) I'm
     heading to the mess.

  LAM
     I'm good, thanks. I should get back to Daniel and
     Vala.

  LANDRY
     Oh, of course. Just keep me posted.

  LAM
     Mm-hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     Lam starts to leave the room.

  LANDRY
     Carolyn, you seem to be...settling in okay.

  LAM
     I don't know if I'll ever get used to this place.
     It's pretty, uh...

  ANNOTATION
     Lam searches for the proper description, then
     laughs in defeat.

  LANDRY
     Yeah.

  LAM
     Yeah, and uh, working for you makes this whole
     thing just that much more bizarre.

  LANDRY
     You didn't have to take the job, you know.

  LAM
     Are you kidding, who could refuse it? Besides, at
     the time, General O'Neill didn't tell me you'd be
     my boss.

  LANDRY
     He's funny that way.

  LAM
     (not amused) Mmm. Ha ha. By the way, the desk
     looks fine the way it is.

  LANDRY
     Mmm. Really?

  LAM
     (exiting) You never were happy with anything the
     way it was.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A large group of villagers gather in the square
     and along a large staircase. Daniel and Vala are
     still arm-in-arm, following the crowd. At the top
     of the staircase, the Administrator lights some
     torches.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     All hallow the Ori.

  VILLAGERS
     All hallow the Ori.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     On their great power, we shall meditate herein
     this day.

  ANNOTATION
     Villagers begin kneeling on the staircase and
     throughout the square.

  DANIEL
     (noting the villagers' actions) Prostration it is.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala copy the movements of the other
     villagers. They kneel before a stone step, leaning
     their forearms against its surface, hands curled
     and palms facing them. Fannis kneels by Daniel, a
     small book clasped between his hands.

  FANNIS
     (speaking low to Daniel behind his book) We must
     meet. By the Portico of Light at the Hour of Bly.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel opens his mouth to respond.

  FANNIS
     (hissing low) Speak not!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stays silent, but looks confused.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Oh Greatness that is the Ori, you guide us and
     give meaning to our daily lives. We beseech you,
     give us strength.

  VILLAGERS
     All hallow the Ori.

  DANIEL
     (copying) All hallow the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel notices Fannis does not recite the prayer
     and stops reciting as well, puzzled.

  VILLAGERS
     All hallow the Ori.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala enter, looking exhausted. They
     close the door behind them and lean against it.

  VALA
     Well, that was fun. Six hours of prostration. Why
     don't we just tell someone who we are and what's
     going on? I mean, isn't that whole point of this,
     to communicate?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel begins randomly picking up and putting down
     objects, jumping from one area of the room to the
     other. Vala follows him from spot to spot.

  DANIEL
     I don't think these people are going to entirely
     understand. Hey, did you hear what that guy said
     when we first came to the service?

  VALA
     Something about meeting...

  DANIEL
     Yeah, at the Portico of Light at the Hour of Bly.

  VALA
     What's that supposed to mean?

  DANIEL
     I have no idea.

  VALA
     What are you looking for?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel heads upstairs. Vala follows, struggling
     with her long skirt on the steps.

  DANIEL
     I don't know. Some reason as to why we're in these
     particular people, these specific bodies. I mean,
     it can't be totally random.

  ANNOTATION
     They enter a small bedroom. Daniel starts
     rummaging through a wardrobe by the door.

  VALA
     Uh, I have a more pressing question. Do you have
     any idea how we're supposed to detach from them?

  DANIEL
     (pausing his search) No. And that's another thing
     that's got me worried. Have you tried?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala pulls off her shoes.

  VALA
     (nodding) Hmm. Nothing.

  DANIEL
     It doesn't seem to be something I can just will to
     make happen.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala spots the bed and leaps onto it, groaning in
     relief to stretch out after the hours of kneeling.
     Daniel continues to rummage through the wardrobe.

  VALA
     (sighing) Maybe it's about removing the stones
     from the device on Earth.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, unfortunately, we can't tell the people on
     Earth that we need them to remove them. We'll just
     have to wait until they figure that out for
     themselves.

  VALA
     Maybe they have already, and it had no effect.

  DANIEL
     (unnerved) I'm just going to rule out that
     possibility.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel finishes searching the wardrobe and moves
     over to the dresser, continuing his search.

  VALA
     Do you think these people are in our bodies?

  DANIEL
     I don't know. I mean, this can't be how the
     technology is supposed to work.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala feels something under the bedcovers. She
     reaches in and pulls out a book. She opens it,
     then shuts it immediately with a strange look on
     her face.

  VALA
     Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala shows him the book. Daniel barely glances at
     it in her hand before continuing his search
     through objects on the bedside table.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, it's the book that some of the villagers
     were walking around with. It says on the front,
     um: The Book of Origins. Blessed are the Ori.

  VALA
     I think you should take a look at it.

  DANIEL
     Oh, I think I've seen enough. I mean, prostration
     for six hours. "Give us strength." You know, it's
     all very clear.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks under the bed and finds nothing.

  VALA
     I think you'd find it really interesting.

  DANIEL
     Yeah? When did you start being able to read
     Ancient?

  VALA
     I can't. But this...looked familiar.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala opens the book to show Daniel two sections
     hollowed out from the pages. In each hollowed
     section is an Ancient communication stone.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     There is insistent knocking at the front door.
     Daniel and Vala hurry downstairs. Daniel takes a
     moment to compose himself, then opens the door.
     Fannis rushes into the house.

  FANNIS
     Thank those full of value. I was worried when you
     did not meet me.

  DANIEL
     (flustered) Yes. Sorry about that.

  FANNIS
     Why did you not meet me? (spots Vala) Why are you
     not sharing leaves with the Administrator's wife?

  VALA
     I...forgot.

  FANNIS
     We are already suspected. We must not alter our
     behavior.

  DANIEL
     Suspected of what?

  FANNIS
     Harrid, what ails you? Did I not know better, I
     would fear you are trying to entrap me.

  DANIEL
     No. I--I wouldn't dream of trying to...

  VALA
     Entrap you? How?

  FANNIS
     Stop this, please.

  DANIEL
     Okay, you know what...Uh, please. Would you, would
     you sit? (to Vala) Go with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis and Daniel sit at the table. Vala perches
     on the table behind Daniel, watching Fannis.

  DANIEL
     My name is Daniel Jackson, and I am inside the
     mind of Harrid. I am able to speak through him by
     use of a communication technology that we believe
     was first constructed and used by a race known as
     the Alterans.

  VALA
     And I'm Vala...Mal Doran.

  DANIEL
     How you doing.

  FANNIS
     (surprised but happy) By the stars. Forgive me, I
     am Fannis.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Vala are relieved by Fannis's easy
     acceptance of their explanation.

  DANIEL
     Uh, nice to meet you. We're from a place called
     Earth.

  FANNIS
     Could I speak with Harrid?

  DANIEL
     No. His consciousness appears to be suppressed so
     long as we're connected.

  FANNIS
     Harrid always suspected the stones were a means of
     communication.

  DANIEL
     You know about the stones?

  FANNIS
     We are curators, investigators of the past. The
     stones were discovered some time ago in what we
     believe are the remains of an ancestral burial
     ground not far from here.

  DANIEL
     Why are you hiding them?

  FANNIS
     Such investigation is sacrilege.

  DANIEL
     You're not allowed to investigate your own
     history?

  FANNIS
     If such investigation contradicts The Book of
     Origin.

  DANIEL
     You're heretics.

  FANNIS
     We have uncovered evidence that we believe proves
     a race of humans predates our supposed creation by
     the Ori.

  VALA
     (interrupting) Excuse me. Daniel, what if these
     gods, the Ori, are the people left behind by the
     Alterans?

  DANIEL
     You think they ascended?

  VALA
     It's possible. The Alterans left a long, long time
     ago, and what we know of the Ancients, they
     learned to evolve and ascend. What if the people
     who remained here did too?

  DANIEL
     That would make these people a subsequent
     evolution of humans, which is apparently what
     happened in our galaxy after the Ancients we know
     ascended.

  VALA
     And it would explain why they're not as advanced
     as we might expect.

  DANIEL
     No, but the religion doesn't fit the profile. The
     ascended beings I know don't pose as gods. I mean,
     that's the one explicit rule they DO follow, is
     that they don't meddle in the affairs of the lower
     planes of existence.

  FANNIS
     The Ori are not posing. We do not doubt their
     power, just their word and intention. Their power
     is as real as the strength of belief in all
     followers. You were late for leaves with the
     Administrator's wife. Sallis and she are
     acquaintances.

  VALA
     So what should I do?

  FANNIS
     Can you not disconnect and allow Sallis to return?

  DANIEL
     No, apparently we can't do that.

  FANNIS
     Then you must pose as Sallis, or we will be
     discovered.

  VALA
     I can do that.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks skeptical, which makes Fannis worry.


LOCATION--TEMPLE AT DAKARA, DAY


LOCATION--HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBERS, DAKARA

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, in Jaffa robes, rushes into the corridor
     toward the chamber, but Rak'nor heads him off.

  RAK'NOR
     The council has already taken respite. The vote
     was quick. I delivered yours by proxy. Gerak's
     motion was resolved by a slim majority. The Jaffa
     will be ruled by High Council. Votes will be
     attributed to the various coalition
     representatives based on military assets.

  TEAL'C
     Making Gerak...

  RAK'NOR
     The new leader of the Jaffa Nation.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks troubled.


LOCATION--HOME OF HARRID AND SALLIS, VER AGER

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pours drinks for him and Fannis. Vala is
     gone.

  FANNIS
     You said the Ori may have ascended. What does that
     mean?

  DANIEL
     (sighing) Where we come from, some people who used
     to look a lot like us evolved physically and
     mentally so much that they found a way to shed
     their physical bodies and live as energy on
     another, higher plane of existence. Some called it
     "enlightenment," and it came with a much greater
     understanding of the universe and all its
     knowledge. Now this happened a long time ago, and
     I believe that those people may have originally
     come from here.

  FANNIS
     And those "ascended beings," as you call them, do
     not guide you and ask that you worship them?

  DANIEL
     No, in fact they believe so strongly in free will
     that they would not intervene and use their
     knowledge even if it meant the destruction of an
     entire galaxy full of us regular old humans.

  FANNIS
     Such is not the case with the Ori.

  DANIEL
     Yes, so they ask that you worship them, and yet
     conceal the truth of your existence from you.

  FANNIS
     That is not all.

  DANIEL
     What are you going to do?

  FANNIS
     We are gathering as much evidence as we can. Our
     hope is that one day we will have enough proof to
     convince even the most devout believers. In the
     meantime, we meet in secret and share with those
     we trust what we have learned. We keep hidden
     those artifacts which prove our claims in case one
     or more of us are discovered.

  DANIEL
     How many of you are there?

  FANNIS
     A few. Our numbers are growing. Some believe the
     fact that we have not yet been discovered is
     further proof that the Ori are not all powerful
     and all knowing. Others wonder if they are just
     giving us the opportunity to see the error of our
     ways and repent.

  ANNOTATION
     Fannis hears voices outside. He looks out the
     window.

  FANNIS
     A crowd gathers at the Ara.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel joins him at the window.

  DANIEL
     That's an altar?

  FANNIS
     (nervous) I cannot be seen with you.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel moves forward to see what is going on,
     jostling villagers as he passes.

  DANIEL
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel comes to the center of the square, where
     the Administrator is orating to the crowd from a
     book. The Administrator paces around a low, wide,
     patterned stone circle. In the center of this
     circle is a small yoke-like bench with shackles on
     either end.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     ...battle of ages. He spoke to the sky and said:
     "And the people shall deliver unto you the wicked
     for your divine judgment, where their sins shall
     be weighed in the balance of all that is just and
     true."

  VALA
     (struggling) Let go of me! Get your hands off me!

  ANNOTATION
     Vala appears, kicking and fighting against two
     villagers holding her, but she cannot break free.
     She spots Daniel across the stone circle.

  VALA
     Daniel!

  DANIEL
     What happened?

  ANNOTATION
     The men restraining Vala force her to her knees
     and shackle her by her wrists to the low bench.

  VALA
     It didn't go so well.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, I can see that. (moves to help her) Excuse
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Two villagers grab Daniel's arms and shoulders,
     preventing his approach.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Harrid, stand back. Sallis has been overcome.

  DANIEL
     (fighting against the villagers hold) No, she
     hasn't. If you'll just let me explain--

  ANNOTATION
     Unobserved, Fannis moves from a column in the back
     of the square and runs from the village.

  DANIEL
     (becoming more desperate) Listen to me!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel cries out as the villagers holding him pull
     him further away from the circle.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Fear not, for the Ori see all, outside and within.
     If your heart is pure and your devotion
     unwavering, they will protect you. They will
     cleanse your being, and you'll be taken to be with
     them forever...

  ANNOTATION
     Vala rolls her eyes. Daniel looks confused and
     worried.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     (continuing) If not, may the fire burn you down to
     the ground and lay you in the dust.

  VALA
     Fire?

  ANNOTATION
     The Administrator signals, and a villager dips a
     lit torch into a bucket, lighting the liquid
     inside.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala is very frightened. Daniel, still restrained,
     also looks scared. Men tilt the bucket, and a
     flaming liquid drains from it into a stone
     channel, flowing around a small circle, and
     continuing to the circular maze-like pattern of
     the stone altar. Vala is shackled at the center of
     this maze.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lam monitors Vala. Lee monitors Daniel. Another
     nurse, two SFs and Mitchell enter.

  LAM
     Her heart rate is 140. She's in distress.

  LEE
     Daniel's B.P. and heart rate are increasing too.

  MITCHELL
     Pull the stones.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee moves to the device and tries to pry the
     stones out by hand.

  LEE
     I can't.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers stand and watch as the fire liquid
     makes its way along the maze-link channel toward
     Vala. Daniel tries unsuccessfully to break free of
     the men restraining him.

  DANIEL
     (to Vala) What the hell did you say?

  VALA
     I think at first it's what I didn't say. You see,
     apparently there's a blessing you're supposed to
     recite over the leaves before you drink, which
     nobody warned me about. Then I think it's what I
     did say. I was trying to politely explain what was
     going on and then his (nodding towards the
     Administrator) wife started screaming and accusing
     me of being overcome. At which point I believe I
     suggested she might want to think about
     procreation...with herself.

  DANIEL
     (panicking) Oh! Oh! (to Administrator) Listen!
     Please! Listen to me! You have to believe me! This
     is not what it looks like. Sallis is not
     possessed, okay? Now this going to sound crazy...
     (makes cuckoo motion with his restrained hand)
     Whoo-hoo. But we're from another galaxy. That's
     right we're using a communication technology that
     allows us to take over a body from very far
     away...and--and--and make us talk to you. We just
     want to talk to you!

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers become nervous at Daniel's
     blasphemy. The Administrator merely stares at
     Daniel for a few moments before returning his
     attention to Vala. Daniel appears completely
     desperate.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lee attempts to pry the stones out with a crowbar,
     but fails.

  LAM
     Okay, this is getting worse. I'm administering a
     sedative. Hopefully, it'll calm things down.

  ANNOTATION
     She prepares a syringe. Mitchell stands by Vala's
     bedside. Vala's rapid eye movement is extremely
     fast, and she is breathing hard.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The villagers stand watching. The liquid fire
     reaches the center of the stone pattern and
     ignites on Vala's skirt. Daniel renews his frantic
     efforts to reach her without success.

  VALA
     (terrified) Daniel!

  DANIEL
     (despairing) Okay, listen to me! Listen to me! You
     have to believe me! You're killing an innocent
     person!

  VALA
     Daniel!

  ADMINISTRATOR
     (in a calm, impassive voice) Blessed are those
     that deliver us from evil.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala screams.

  DANIEL
     No! NO!

  ANNOTATION
     Vala is immolated, screaming. Daniel turns away.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Vala's heart monitor flatlines. Lam pulls a crash
     cart over as other medical staff scurry around.

  LAM
     She's in V-Fib. Code Blue. Charging to 200.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell retrieves a firearm from an SF and cocks
     it, aiming at the device. Lee moves in front of
     Mitchell. As Mitchell adjusts his aim, Lee dodges
     to remain in Mitchell's line of fire.

  LEE
     Whoa! Whoa, no! Don't shoot!

  MITCHELL
     (upset) You got a better idea?

  LEE
     You might cause a surge. You could kill them both.
     You might detonate the power source. Now, come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee covers the device with his body. Lam and a
     nurse try to restart Vala's heart.

  LAM
     (shocking Vala) Clear!


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Vala's body is still burning. Daniel looks at her
     and then away, still held by the villagers. Some
     of the villagers appear upset at the sight they've
     witnessed. The Administrator is unmoved. A wind
     picks up, and the flames suddenly extinguish,
     revealing Vala's burned body. Everyone turns to
     look to the village entrance.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior, in a hooded robe and carrying a staff
     topped with a blue orb, enters. The villagers drop
     to their knees and prostrate themselves. The men
     restraining Daniel do the same, releasing him.
     Daniel approaches Vala's charred corpse. He
     cradles Vala in his arms and strokes her blackened
     hand. He appears surprised that he is able to
     release her from the metal shackles. He looks back
     at the Prior, who inclines his head.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Lam and the other medical staff continue their
     attempts to revive Vala. Lee is still attempting
     to remove the stones. Mitchell watches both of
     them. Landry enters the observation room.

  LAM
     Charge to 360. Clear! (shocks Vala) Still in
     V-Fib. Charging again. Clear!

  ANNOTATION
     Lam shocks Vala again. Lam watches the monitors
     and shakes her head.

  LAM
     (feeling Vala's wrist) I've got no pulse. She's
     gone into asystole. I'm calling it.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee looks up in shock.

  MITCHELL
     She's dead!?

  LAM
     I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Lam walks past Mitchell toward the exit. Landry
     shakes his head at Mitchell from the observation
     room. Mitchell turns to look at Vala's body.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior approaches Daniel and Vala's corpse. He
     tilts his staff towards Vala, and the orb emits a
     glow. Vala's clothing and hair are restored to
     their previous pristine state. As Daniel watches,
     the burns disappear from her hands, and her skin
     becomes whole.


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Vala is still hooked up to the monitors. Lam
     checks Daniel's vital signs with a hand to his
     neck.

  LAM
     His vitals have stabilized for the moment.

  MITCHELL
     (to Lee) You can't pry the stones off?

  LEE
     No.

  MITCHELL
     And you don't want me to shoot it?

  LEE
     No.

  MITCHELL
     Then how do we unplug this thing?

  LEE
     I don't know.

  MITCHELL
     Brilliant.

  LAM
     At the very least, we need to find a way to get
     that bracelet off of Dr. Jackson. They're still
     linked, and without Vala, he'll probably--

  ANNOTATION
     Vala's monitors start beeping. Lam turns to Vala
     and studies the monitor.

  LAM
     (incredulous) She's got a heartbeat.


LOCATION--VILLAGE SQUARE OF VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The last burns disappear from Vala's face, and she
     wakes up, though still in shock. She obviously
     remembers what happened. The Prior straightens his
     staff and it stops glowing.

  VALA
     (distressed) Daniel?

  DANIEL
     (gently, placing his hand under her chin) You
     okay?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala nods, tears overflowing her eyes. She
     embraces Daniel.

  VALA
     (crying) I've got tingles all over. And don't
     flatter yourself--I'm pretty sure it's not you.

  DANIEL
     (to Prior) Thank you.

  PRIOR
     Thank the Ori. Stand. You will come with me.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns and walks away in a slow processional
     gait.

  DANIEL
     (softly) I think he wants us to follow him. Can
     you walk?

  VALA
     (nods as she fights tears) If it means getting
     away from here.

  ANNOTATION
     Emotionally spent himself, Daniel half carries the
     weakened Vala as they follow the Prior.

  PRIOR
     (just prior to exiting) Hallowed are the children
     of the Ori.

  VILLAGERS
     (still prostrating themselves) Hallowed are we.
     Hallowed are the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     After the three leave the square, the villagers
     rise to their feet, talking amongst themselves.

  ADMINISTRATOR
     Hallowed are the Ori.


LOCATION--VER AGER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     View of the general landscape of the planet. The
     sky is overcast with clouds. Mountains are in the
     distance, trees in the foreground. The village is
     nestled in a valley.
