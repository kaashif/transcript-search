They talk to each other in Russian in concerned voices. One sailor attempts to release the water. He works at a lever and the water indicator begins to lower. The sailors then hear a metallic sound coming from the tube and open the hatch cautiously. A small amount of water empties into the room. All the time they are muttering in Russian sounding very worried.</td></tr>

It sprays the Russian in the face with some kind of liquid and the Russian screams. As the second Russian tries to help him a third Russian submariner rushes to help.</td></tr>
