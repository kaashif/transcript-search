<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: O'Neill and SG-1 are sitting at a table in one of the tents, enjoying a pitiful looking meal. They are sitting with two men, Ellori, an elder, and Charzen, his young advisor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>JONAS: He was the Canaanite god of death. According to mythology, he was defeated by Ba'al and then forced to live in the underworld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>TEAL'C: In all likelihood there was a power struggle. Ba'al defeated Mot and forced him into servitude.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>CARTER: When you think you're reliving a moment it's called deja vu. It's normal, it's said to be caused by split second delay in sense perception.</td></tr>

They are fired upon, but retaliate, killing at least two SGC guards. Hammond gets up, and sees Davis, who took the full force of the original staff blast. Jaffa continue to come through the Gate, firing at anything that moves. The last gateroom guards are picked off by a Jaffa, while another Jaffa comes through the Gate, carrying a large round object, like a giant light grenade. He places it on the ramp while the other Jaffa cover him. He activates it, just as SGC reinforcements enter the gateroom. Hammond crawls to the desk, putting his hand on the iris control and sealing the iris. He stands up, watching the action in the gateroom, and locks eyes with the head Jaffa, who is kneeling next to the large device he brought through. The crystals in the device pulse for a moment, then there is a blinding flash of light as the device explodes.</td></tr>
