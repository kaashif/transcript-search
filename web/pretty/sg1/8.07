LOCATION--STREET

  ANNOTATION
     A young girl cycles down a quiet residential
     street as a couple of joggers pass by. A car comes
     down the street and collides into the rear of
     another car just in front of it. A young boy
     sitting on a bench looks up at the crash and the
     joggers turn to see what happened. Three men exit
     the car which crashed into the back of the other
     and a young man exits the front car. The radiator
     of the second car is hissing.

  BULLY
     (yelling) What the hell are you doing?

  DRIVER
     I was trying to park.

  BULLY
     Huh! Didn't you ever hear of signaling, pal?

  DRIVER
     I did signal.

  BULLY
     Listen man, if you don't know how to drive, maybe
     you should try staying off the damn road!

  ANNOTATION
     One of the men has walked around to stand behind
     the young driver.

  DRIVER
     Maybe, if you hadn't have been tailgating me this
     wouldn't have happened.

  ANNOTATION
     The bully turns to his other friend, amazed that
     the young man has replied to him.

  BULLY
     Oh, no, you didn't just say that.

  ANNOTATION
     The bully grabs the driver by the front of his
     jacket and pushes him against the car.

  DRIVER
     Look, man, I don't want any trouble.

  ANNOTATION
     The young boy watching, looks around, concerned.

  BULLY
     Too late.

  ANNOTATION
     The bully swings his arm back to punch the young
     driver but his wrist is grabbed by Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     This is unlawful behaviour.

  BULLY
     Who the hell are you?

  TEAL'C
     Collision procedure dictates that you exchange
     insurance information and, if necessary, notify
     the police.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the bully's friends laughs at the
     interruption.

  BULLY
     (laughing, amazed) What?

  TEAL'C
     This gentleman did indeed signal, which would
     indicate that it was you who was at fault.

  ANNOTATION
     The bully grabs at Teal'c's hand, trying to free
     himself.

  BULLY
     Pal, you'd better learn to mind your own damn
     business.

  ANNOTATION
     The bully takes a swing at Teal'c, who blocks the
     punch easily. Teal'c head buts the man, who
     collapses to the ground. One of his friends comes
     towards Teal'c, swinging. Teal'c ducks, then hits
     the man in the face with his palm, then punches
     him. The man collapses to the ground. The third
     bully throws a punch, but Teal'c lowers his head
     and the bully hits the top of his skull, badly
     hurting his hand. Teal'c punches the man, who also
     collapses to the ground. The first bully, spitting
     blood, tries to get up but is once again punched
     to the ground.

  KID
     (awed) Wow!

  TEAL'C
     (to driver) I believe it will now be necessary to
     notify the police.

  DRIVER
     Yeah. Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows slightly and smiles at the driver.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Davis knocks carefully at the door, obviously not
     wanting to disturb O'Neill who is doing paperwork.

  DAVIS
     Sir...uhh...Colonel Kendrick from the Office of
     Special Investigations is here to see you.

  O'NEILL
     (loudly and pointedly) Does he have an
     appointment?

  DAVIS
     No, sir...

  ANNOTATION
     The door swings open and Kendrick pushes past
     Davis to stand in front of O'Neill.

  KENDRICK
     You wouldn't return my phone calls. Sir.

  O'NEILL
     I was busy...didn't think it was important? Take
     your pick.

  KENDRICK
     You know as well as I do there's been another
     incident.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks over at Davis who is still in the
     doorway. Davis raises his hand and leaves.

  KENDRICK
     When you petitioned the OSI to allow Teal'c to
     live off base, your request was approved under
     certain provisions. These provisions have clearly
     been violated.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, come on, Colonel. If you had saved Earth from
     total annihilation a couple of times and your
     government told you you couldn't go out to
     play...wouldn't you consider it more a...guideline
     than a rule?

  KENDRICK
     We all appreciate what Teal'c has done for us,
     sir, on numerous occasions. But that doesn't
     change the fact that he's a liability and every
     day he's allowed to roam around in public
     jeopardises national security.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, don't be so dramatic, Dick, it'll give you
     gas.

  KENDRICK
     (threateningly) Either you take action to ensure
     these provisions are met...or the OSI will.

  O'NEILL
     Hey! Watch it. I'll look into it.

  KENDRICK
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendrick leaves, with O'Neill waving his hand
     after him.


LOCATION--APARTMENT BLOCK


LOCATION--TEAL'C'S APARTMENT

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c opens the apartment door in response to a
     knock.

  DANIEL
     Hey!

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson.

  DANIEL
     Just wanted to come by and see how you're settling
     in.

  TEAL'C
     Please enter.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel walks in and looks around as Teal'c closes
     the door.

  DANIEL
     Wow! I like what you're doing with the place. Sort
     of...Jaffa chic with a east African flair.

  TEAL'C
     I have discovered there are many programmes on
     television which offer advice in the area of home
     design and decoration.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, I'm a little more into the history channel
     myself.

  TEAL'C
     Can I offer you anything?

  DANIEL
     No, I'm fine. How's the fern doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c raises an eyebrow and gestures to a plant
     on a shelf. The fern does not look healthy. Daniel
     walks up to it and touches its leaves.

  DANIEL
     I don't suppose you've tried talking to it.

  TEAL'C
     I have not. Perhaps you should tell me why you are
     here.

  DANIEL
     A guy just can't come by and visit his friend?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sits as Teal'c raises an eyebrow
     questioningly.

  DANIEL
     Yep, heard what happened the other day. Three
     KO's, first round.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gets up from the chair.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill sent you to speak with me.

  DANIEL
     No...yeah.

  TEAL'C
     I broke no law. I intervened to prevent a criminal
     activity and was forced to defend myself.

  DANIEL
     You see, that's kind of the point. Look, there's
     no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to live off
     base. I mean, especially when you're not carrying
     a symbiote anymore, but... you're supposed to be
     keeping a low profile.

  TEAL'C
     That is not always easy.

  DANIEL
     I'm not just talking about the tattoo, although I
     do see how that could be a problem.

  TEAL'C
     I often cover it, to avoid stares in public. I
     tell those who have seen it, that it is a tribal
     mark from my homeland.

  DANIEL
     Yes, this is less about appearance, than it is
     about behaviour.

  TEAL'C
     Have I not conducted myself as a typical member of
     this community?

  DANIEL
     No, no, actually, no, you haven't. Ummm...besides
     the other day, there was the incident with the old
     man and the teenagers in the park. There was that
     thing with the guy with the pitbull.

  TEAL'C
     In each case, I was only attempting to render
     assistance where it was needed.

  DANIEL
     You see, that's kinda the problem. Normal human
     beings are a little more careful about getting
     involved in business that isn't theirs. I know.
     That sounds bad, but it's just the way it is, and
     you can't afford to be drawing attention to
     yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c ponders what Daniel has said.

  TEAL'C
     I understand.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a knock at the door and Teal'c turns to
     answer it.

  TEAL'C
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens the door to a young woman.

  WOMAN
     Hi.

  TEAL'C
     Krista.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista holds up a bag of cookies.

  KRISTA
     Made you cookies.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles and accepts the bag.

  TEAL'C
     Please come in.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista enters and sees Daniel in the apartment.

  KRISTA
     I'm sorry, I didn't realise you had company.

  TEAL'C
     Krista James, this is Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Krista walk up to Daniel. Krista and
     Daniel shake hands.

  DANIEL
     (smiling) Hi.

  TEAL'C
     Krista lives in the apartment next door.

  KRISTA
     Wait a minute, Doctor Jackson? You're the
     archaeologist who hired Teal'c to come over from
     Mozambique.

  DANIEL
     That's right!

  KRISTA
     Well, then I should thank you. It's been great
     having him here. It's nice to have a man around
     who cares about his neighbours.

  DANIEL
     Actually, we were just talking about that.

  KRISTA
     In fact, that's why I'm here. (to Teal'c) The
     cookies were a bribe. My pipes are doing that
     thing again.

  TEAL'C
     Normally, I would be happy to provide assistance,
     however...

  DANIEL
     No, no, no, no, no. Don't let me interrupt. I've
     gotta be going anyway. It's very nice to meet you.

  KRISTA
     Nice to meet you.

  DANIEL
     Ah, Teal'c, that other thing we were talking
     about, ummm...every rule has its exceptions.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel waves as he leaves and Krista raises her
     hand in farewell.


LOCATION--PARK

  ANNOTATION
     Pete and Carter are buying food from a cart.

  PETE
     (to vendor) Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk away from the vendor.

  PETE
     So, how are things in the galaxy?

  CARTER
     You know I can't talk about work.

  PETE
     Sorry. I'm still getting used to the fact that my
     girlfriend's a superhero.

  CARTER
     A bit of an exaggeration.

  PETE
     The superhero part? Or the girlfriend part?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles at Pete.

  PETE
     You travel to other planets to do battle with
     alien creatures bent on galactic domination. Just
     because you don't wear a tight spandex outfit
     doesn't mean that you're not...although...it's an
     idea you might wanna consider.

  ANNOTATION
     They are now sitting on a bench. They both laugh.

  CARTER
     Look, I know this is hard for you. Any other guy
     would have just freaked out and run away.

  PETE
     You didn't run away when I stalked you. Anyway, I
     just want you to appreciate the position I'm in
     here.

  CARTER
     I do, believe me, and I'm really glad you stuck
     around.

  PETE
     I'm glad to hear you say that, 'cos I put in for a
     transfer to Colorado Springs PD.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles and kisses Pete.

  CARTER
     Are you sure?

  PETE
     I've never been more sure of anything in my entire
     life. That's why I got you this.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete shows Carter a ring box, containing a diamond
     ring. Carter is completely surprised.

  CARTER
     Oh, my God!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Pete, saying nothing.


LOCATION--STREET

  ANNOTATION
     A couple of joggers run past Teal'c and Krista,
     who are walking along the street, carrying paper
     sacks of groceries.

  KRISTA
     I'm sorry to keep asking you to help with my
     plumbing but the super's never around and my
     boyfriend's not very handy.

  TEAL'C
     There is no need to apologise.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk past a woman getting out of her car. The
     woman places her handbag on the car roof.

  KRISTA
     Anyhow, you'll forgive me once you've tasted my
     lasagne.

  TEAL'C
     I'm looking forward to it.

  ANNOTATION
     The young boy who witnessed Teal'c beating the
     three bullies walks up to them.

  KID
     Yo, T!

  TEAL'C
     Greetings, Eric.

  ANNOTATION
     The two shake hands extravagantly.

  ERIC
     I saw you take out those three gorillas the other
     day. Nice work.

  TEAL'C
     In retrospect it may have been unwise to
     intervene.

  ERIC
     Are you kidding? They deserved it.

  ANNOTATION
     The woman at the car is standing, putting on
     makeup. A young man runs up to the car and grabs
     her handbag from the roof.

  WOMAN
     Hey! Hey stop that guy, he's got my purse, hey!

  ANNOTATION
     The thief runs past Krista, knocking her shopping
     to the ground.

  ERIC
     Aren't you gonna do anything?

  TEAL'C
     I must not intervene.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista looks back at Teal'c. puzzled.

  ERIC
     What? You just gonna let him get away?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at the thief, running further into
     the distance, and at Krista, who turns away to
     look at the thief. Teal'c places his bag on the
     ground, picks up a piece of fruit and throws it,
     hitting the thief, who collapses to the ground.

  ERIC
     Oh man! What a shot.

  KRISTA
     How did you do that?

  ERIC
     You the man, T.

  ANNOTATION
     The woman turns to Teal'c, amazed.

  WOMAN
     Thank you. That was amazing.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles and bows at the woman.

  KRISTA
     That was amazing.

  ERIC
     T money, you are the man. Gotta give the man his
     props.

  ANNOTATION
     As Teal'c shakes hands with Eric, it becomes
     obvious that someone is taking photos of Teal'c.
     Teal'c looks around, uncomfortable.


LOCATION--TEAL'C'S APARTMENT NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     The apartment is lit by many candles. Teal'c hears
     a man banging at Krista's door.

  MAN
     Krista! Krista! Come on, Krista. Listen, listen,
     listen, just let me in. Just let me in.


LOCATION--BUILDING HALLWAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c goes out into the hallway and walks towards
     Krista's apartment.

  KRISTA
     Doug, I have to work tomorrow.

  DOUG
     So?

  KRISTA
     So? You're drunk. Just go home. Please.

  DOUG
     No, no, no, I ain't going nowhere.

  KRISTA
     Doug...

  TEAL'C
     Is there a problem?

  DOUG
     This is a private conversation.

  TEAL'C
     If it were private, you would not be conducting it
     in the hallway, nor speaking so loudly.

  ANNOTATION
     A door behind Teal'c opens, and an elderly woman
     holding a cat peers out. Teal'c turns towards the
     neighbour.

  KRISTA
     (to neighbour) It's alright, Mrs Connors. Just go
     back inside.

  ANNOTATION
     The woman glares, and shuts the door. Teal'c turns
     back to Krista and Doug, the smile he gave to the
     neighbour slipping from his face.

  TEAL'C
     (to Krista) Do you require assistance?

  KRISTA
     No, I'm okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Doug turns away from Krista to face Teal'c.

  DOUG
     Who the hell is this guy?

  KRISTA
     His name is Teal'c. He's my neighbour.

  DOUG
     Teal'c? What kind of a crazy name is that?

  KRISTA
     He just moved here form Mozambique.

  DOUG
     Ooh...no doubt.

  TEAL'C
     Krista has requested that you leave. I suggest you
     comply.

  DOUG
     You better check yourself, before you get hurt.

  TEAL'C
     I have checked. I suggest you leave, before it's
     you that gets hurt.

  KRISTA
     Doug, go sober up.

  DOUG
     You know what? I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

  ANNOTATION
     Doug leaves.

  KRISTA
     I'm sorry about that. I hate when he gets that
     way.

  TEAL'C
     This is not the first time. So you have stopped
     receiving him.

  KRISTA
     Not exactly. He's not always like that. Since he
     lost his job, he's just been, you know...

  TEAL'C
     I do not.

  KRISTA
     It's been hard on him.

  TEAL'C
     And has it not been hard on you?

  KRISTA
     I'm fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles slightly, and nods at Krista.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY


LOCATION--SGC DANIEL'S LAB

  TEAL'C
     I do not understand Krista's behaviour.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is standing at Daniel's desk. Carter and
     Daniel are seated behind it, at a monitor.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, it's a common problem. Most cultures on
     Earth recognise that there's a significant gap
     between the experiences of men and women. Among
     the Masai of East Africa, each newly wed man is
     required to wear his wife's clothing for a month,
     as a way of gaining insight into her life.

  CARTER
     If only it were that simple.

  DANIEL
     The point is, while rituals and customs may vary,
     almost all cultures put significant pressure on
     single adults to form bonding pairs. In ancient
     Persia, if a girl died a virgin, they would go so
     far as to marry her corpse off before burial.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns to Daniel, shocked.

  CARTER
     That's horrible

  DANIEL
     The groom was usually quite well paid.

  CARTER
     It's bad enough being on your own without every TV
     show and commercial and magazine ad trying to tell
     you how abnormal it is.

  DANIEL
     I think that's what I just said.

  CARTER
     They make you afraid of being alone but at the
     same time tell you not to settle for anything less
     than the perfect romantic ideal, like that
     actually exists anywhere in the real world. Either
     way you can't win!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sighs. Daniel looks at Teal'c, eyebrows
     raised.

  DANIEL
     (to Carter) How's things?

  CARTER
     Good. We were talking about Teal'c's friend,
     right?

  DANIEL
     I thought we were.

  CARTER
     Teal'c, how do Jaffa couples handle their
     problems?

  TEAL'C
     On Chulak, a dispute between a man and a woman
     that cannot be resolved necessitates a pledge
     break. It must be requested by one and granted by
     the other.

  DANIEL
     And if that doesn't work?

  TEAL'C
     A weapon is required.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel say nothing.


LOCATION--PARK DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is practising his Tai'Chi-like exercises.
     Krista is behind him, watching.

  KRISTA
     Sorry, I don't want to interrupt you, I just came
     out for a little air.

  TEAL'C
     Are you alright?

  KRISTA
     I had another fight with Doug. I told him it's
     over. I don't want to see him anymore.

  TEAL'C
     Are you not happy with your decision?

  KRISTA
     I guess it was the right thing to do. But he's not
     a bad person. He's just going through a tough
     time.

  TEAL'C
     You have no cause to feel guilty.

  KRISTA
     What was that you were just doing?

  TEAL'C
     It is called Lok'nel, an ancient form of martial
     arts training.

  KRISTA
     You think you could teach me?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles slightly and bows his head in
     agreement. They begin. Many days pass with Teal'c
     training Krista in the art. They practise both in
     the park and in the apartment. An attraction
     appears to be forming between the two.


LOCATION--BUILDING HALLWAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leaves his apartment and goes to Krista's
     door.


LOCATION--KRISTA'S APARTMENT

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c knocks on Krista's door.

  KRISTA
     Oh, hi.

  TEAL'C
     You are late for your next training session.

  KRISTA
     Yeah, I meant to tell you. I don't think I'm going
     to be able to train with you anymore.

  TEAL'C
     You have been making tremendous progress.

  KRISTA
     Well, I just don't have time, you know?

  TEAL'C
     Has something transpired?

  KRISTA
     No, everything's fine. Look, I've gotta go.

  ANNOTATION
     As Krista brings up her right hand to close the
     door, Teal'c notices bruising around her wrist and
     stops her from closing the door.

  TEAL'C
     You are injured.

  KRISTA
     It's nothing. Please

  DOUG
     (from inside the apartment) Krista, who is it?

  KRISTA
     It's just my neighbour.

  ANNOTATION
     Doug comes to the door.

  DOUG
     Oh yeah? The plumber. I'll handle this.

  KRISTA
     Doug, it's not...

  DOUG
     I said, I'll handle it!

  ANNOTATION
     Krista goes back into the apartment as the
     neighbour's door opens and the woman peers out.

  DOUG
     Don't think I don't know what's been going on
     around here. She told me everything.

  TEAL'C
     Are you the one who injured her?

  DOUG
     What goes on between me and Krista, it ain't none
     of your business.

  TEAL'C
     If you ever injure her again, I will kill you
     where you stand.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leaves.


LOCATION--SGC CARTER'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working at a computer on her desk.
     O'Neill enters.

  O'NEILL
     Carter.

  CARTER
     Sir.

  O'NEILL
     I never thought I'd hear myself utter these words.
     I need that report.

  CARTER
     Right. Um, I just need to finish typing up my
     notes.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter starts searching her desk.

  CARTER
     Uh...yeah, I'll have it for you first thing
     tomorrow.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at his watch.

  O'NEILL
     It is tomorrow.

  CARTER
     Oh.

  O'NEILL
     I'm joking, I don't need the report.

  CARTER
     Well then, why....

  O'NEILL
     Because something's going on with you. You haven't
     tried to confuse me with any scientific babble for
     the last couple of days and that's a red flag to
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sighs and hands the ring box to O'Neill.

  CARTER
     Pete gave me this.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill takes the box and opens it.

  O'NEILL
     People normally wear these on their fingers.

  CARTER
     I haven't said yes.

  O'NEILL
     And yet, you haven't said no.

  CARTER
     I told him I needed to think about it.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts down the ring box.

  CARTER
     That was two weeks ago.

  O'NEILL
     Ah!

  CARTER
     You know, all these years I've been concentrating
     on work I just assumed that one day I would...

  O'NEILL
     Have a life?

  CARTER
     Yeah. And now it comes down to it, I don't know. I
     mean, every time we go through the gate we risk
     not coming back. Is it fair to put somebody else
     through that?

  O'NEILL
     Pete is a cop. I think he could handle it.

  CARTER
     What about kids?

  O'NEILL
     What about 'em?

  CARTER
     Do I take maternity leave and then come back? Do I
     drop the baby off at daycare on my way to some
     unexplored planet on the edge of the crab nebula?

  O'NEILL
     Carter, there are people on this base who have
     families.

  CARTER
     What about you? If things had been different...

  O'NEILL
     I wouldn't be here.


LOCATION--BUILDING HALLWAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c enters the hallway and sees Krista sitting
     on the floor outside his door.

  TEAL'C
     Krista.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista gets up, wiping tears from her face.

  KRISTA
     Hey, I was waiting for you.

  TEAL'C
     Has something happened?

  KRISTA
     No, I'm fine. It's just, it's over with Doug. For
     real this time. I'm sorry about what happened
     before.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c smiles and gently wipes the tears from her
     cheek with his thumb.

  KRISTA
     I need to get out of here. I can't even think in
     this place. Will you come with me?

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps tomorrow.

  KRISTA
     No, now. Tonight. We'll just get in the car and
     drive. We'll take the whole weekend. It doesn't
     even matter where we end up, as long as it's away
     from here. Please.


LOCATION--SGC DANIEL'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is working at a monitor as Carter enters,
     looking worried.

  DANIEL
     Hey, what's going on?

  CARTER
     General O'Neill just got off the phone with
     Colonel Kendrick. Krista's boyfriend was found
     dead in her apartment.

  DANIEL
     What? What happened?

  CARTER
     We don't have all the details yet, but according
     to Kendrick, preliminary evidence indicates that
     Teal'c may have been responsible.

  DANIEL
     That's impossible.

  CARTER
     That's what I said. Unfortunately, we can't ask
     him about it because he's missing. So Krista. As
     of right now, Teal'c is wanted for kidnapping and
     murder.


LOCATION--VEHICLE NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is driving with Krista in the passenger
     seat.

  KRISTA
     Thanks for getting me out of there. I just
     couldn't be in that place tonight.

  TEAL'C
     Where do you wish to go?

  KRISTA
     Just keep driving.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c adjusts the rear-view mirror.

  KRISTA
     What? What is it?

  TEAL'C
     I do not wish to alarm you but I believe that we
     are being followed.

  KRISTA
     Who would be following us?

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps Doug.

  KRISTA
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks over at Krista.

  KRISTA
     He doesn't know I'm gone yet.

  TEAL'C
     Then they are most likely following me.

  KRISTA
     You? Why would anyone be following you?

  TEAL'C
     It is difficult to explain.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista looks back to see a car follow them around
     a corner.

  KRISTA
     Can you lose them?

  TEAL'C
     I believe so. However, it will require me to
     violate posted speed limits and several safe
     driving regulations.

  KRISTA
     I'm okay with that.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at Krista and nods.

  TEAL'C
     Hold on.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c presses down on the accelerator and the
     vehicle can be heard speeding up.


LOCATION--MOTEL ROOM NIGHT

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Krista enter a motel room. As Teal'c
     shuts the door, Krista closes the curtains.

  KRISTA
     Don't tell me you learned how to do that back in
     your village.

  TEAL'C
     There are aspects of my life which I am not at
     liberty to divulge.

  KRISTA
     What are you? A spy or something? One thing's for
     sure, you're not really Doctor Jackson's research
     assistant. That much I figure after about 30
     seconds.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c sighs.

  TEAL'C
     Krista...

  ANNOTATION
     Krista places her finger on his lips to stop him
     saying any more.

  KRISTA
     It's okay. For now, I'm just glad you're here.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss.


LOCATION--CARTER'S CAR DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Pete gets into Carter's car.

  PETE
     Hi.

  CARTER
     Thanks for meeting me.

  PETE
     No problem.

  CARTER
     Pete, I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete's smile fades.

  CARTER
     I need a little more time. Look, you know how I
     feel about you, it's just...there's some things I
     need to work out.

  PETE
     Okay.

  CARTER
     Anyway, that's not what this is about.

  PETE
     It's not?

  CARTER
     No. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't so important.

  PETE
     What's going on?

  CARTER
     I need your help.


LOCATION--MOTEL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c wakes to find the bed next to him empty.

  TEAL'C
     Krista?

  ANNOTATION
     There is no reply.

  TEAL'C
     Krista!

  ANNOTATION
     As Teal'c checks the bathroom, there is a knock at
     the door. Teal'c opens it, to be faced with a
     number of armed policemen.

  OFFICER
     Police! Turn around and lace your fingers behind
     your head.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c does so, frowning.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill is walking down the corridor, followed by
     Kendrick.

  KENDRICK
     Well, where is he being held?

  O'NEILL
     He's in his old quarters.

  ANNOTATION
     Kendrick sighs.

  KENDRICK
     Is he at least under guard?

  O'NEILL
     He's not going anywhere.

  KENDRICK
     He's a murder suspect.


LOCATION--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     They enter the office.

  O'NEILL
     You know, I talked to him. He said he didn't do
     it.

  KENDRICK
     That's good enough for you is it?

  O'NEILL
     Pretty much.

  KENDRICK
     Well, unfortunately, you're not in charge of this
     investigation.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. He also said he felt like he was being
     followed last night.

  KENDRICK
     The OSI did not have Teal'c under surveillance.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah. How did you find him?

  KENDRICK
     We received a tip.

  O'NEILL
     That didn't strike you as...odd?

  KENDRICK
     I told you something like this might happen, you
     flat out ignored my warnings.

  O'NEILL
     Not so much ignored as completely disregarded.

  KENDRICK
     With all due respect, General. I'm going to have
     to insist that Teal'c be placed in confinement
     immediately, or I will recommend that he be held
     elsewhere.


LOCATION--SGC DANIEL'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sorting through paperwork on his desk.
     Suddenly, on the monitor in front of him, a number
     of symbols appear followed by the message, "Look
     familiar?"

  DANIEL
     What the hell?

  ANNOTATION
     The phone rings and Daniel answers it.

  DANIEL
     Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     The male voice on the other end of the line is
     distorted.

  CALLER
     Did you get my message?

  DANIEL
     Who is this?

  CALLER
     The symbols, Doctor Jackson. Do you recognise
     them?

  DANIEL
     I don't know who you think this is.

  CALLER
     We need it translated into Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     I have no idea what you're talking about.

  CALLER
     We know it's the language of the Ancients, but the
     dialect is obscure. You're the one man on Earth
     who can translate them. Your friend Teal'c is in
     trouble.

  DANIEL
     How do you know about that?

  CALLER
     We can help him. We've been watching him. In fact,
     we saw the whole thing.

  DANIEL
     You witnessed the murder?

  CALLER
     We've got it all on tape. Concrete evidence that
     proves Teal'c's innocence, and it's yours in
     exchange for the translation. Of course, if you
     tell anyone we'll know, and the deals off.

  ANNOTATION
     The caller rings off.


LOCATION--STREET DAY


LOCATION--KRISTA'S APARTMENT

  ANNOTATION
     Pete and Carter are looking at the marked outline
     of a body.

  PETE
     The investigator who checked the position of the
     body, concluded that the victim was pinned and
     choked against this wall, and then fell to the
     floor.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete crouches by the outline.

  CARTER
     So...?

  PETE
     So, I'm not so sure. The proximity of the body to
     the wall supports that, but the position of the
     body suggests otherwise.

  CARTER
     What do you mean?

  PETE
     If he fell into a slump, his legs and arms would
     be bent.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete shows Carter a photograph of the body.

  PETE
     His legs are straight and his arms are placed by
     his sides, suggesting that the body was dragged
     here and placed in this position.

  CARTER
     Why move the body?

  PETE
     Well, dying against the wall suggested the victim
     was attacked by somebody bigger and stronger.

  CARTER
     Like Teal'c. So it was a set up.

  PETE
     It's possible. Now, you said that Teal'c thought
     he was being followed.

  CARTER
     That's right.

  PETE
     The Air Force denies having him under
     surveillance?

  CARTER
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete walks over to the window and pulls back the
     curtains to look across to the apartments over the
     road.

  PETE
     If I were staking out Teal'c's place, that's where
     I would be.


LOCATION--ANOTHER APARTMENT

  ANNOTATION
     Pete unlocks the door and enters, followed by
     Carter.

  PETE
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter shuts the door. The apartment is empty of
     furniture. Pete and Carter walk over to one of the
     windows.

  PETE
     From this vantage point you can easily see into
     both apartments.

  ANNOTATION
     Pete crouches down, pointing out three marks in
     the carpet.

  PETE
     Three indentations.

  CARTER
     Tripod.

  PETE
     Unfortunately, I think they cleaned the place up
     pretty good. I doubt we'll find anything.

  CARTER
     So it's a dead end.

  PETE
     Not necessarily. Is there a pizza place nearby?

  CARTER
     Why?

  PETE
     One thing about a stakeout? You never eat healthy.


LOCATION--PARK

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is waiting in the park. He is approached by
     a man holding a styrofoam coffee cup.

  MAN
     Doctor Jackson. Keep walking. You came alone. I'm
     impressed. I like a man who can follow
     instructions.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk towards a bench.

  DANIEL
     You're the one who called me?

  MAN
     It doesn't matter. Have you completed the
     translation?

  DANIEL
     Yeah, see, that's why I wanted to talk to you. I
     need more time.

  MAN
     You're playing with your friend's life here,
     Doctor.

  DANIEL
     I can't translate something unless I understand
     the context. Where they were found, what they're
     for.

  MAN
     You think I'm stupid?

  DANIEL
     I'm not lying.

  MAN
     I can see we're going to have to do this the hard
     way.

  DANIEL
     What does that mean?

  MAN
     Either you give us the translation now, or I'll be
     forced to take this to the next level.

  DANIEL
     So, beyond kidnapping and murder?

  MAN
     We didn't kill the boyfriend. But we'll kill the
     girl if we have to.

  DANIEL
     How do I know you even have her?

  MAN
     Come with me and I'll show you.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, you know, I got a thing, so...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns to walk away.

  MAN
     I have three snipers targeting your position at
     this very moment, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns back.

  DANIEL
     You're bluffing.

  ANNOTATION
     The man places the coffee cup on the bench.

  MAN
     Position one, take the coffee cup

  ANNOTATION
     A bullet pierces the centre of the cup.

  DANIEL
     So, we gonna take your car or mine, or should I
     just follow you?


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY


LOCATION--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

  CARTER
     We checked a couple of pizza joints and all night
     delivery places near your apartment to see if
     there'd been any sudden repeat customers.

  TEAL'C
     Interesting investigative method.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I thought it was a little crazy at first
     too, but we actually got a lead at one place. The
     owner reported a Caucasian male who'd been in half
     a dozen times during the last two weeks.

  TEAL'C
     Is that unusual?

  CARTER
     Not necessarily, but we thought it was worth
     checking out. We got a license plate from the
     security camera out front and we're running it
     down.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head at Carter. A guard opens the
     door and O'Neill enters.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter stand.

  O'NEILL
     Well, Kendrick is finally convinced something else
     is going on here.

  CARTER
     What changed his mind?

  O'NEILL
     Daniel's missing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c look at each other, concerned.


LOCATION--VEHICLE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting in the rear of the van, with his
     hands handcuffed in front of him. Two men,
     including the one who met him in the park, are
     sitting next to him.

  DANIEL
     So you guys are ex NID? Calling yourselves a trust
     now, right?

  MAN
     We want the same thing you want, Doctor Jackson.
     We're trying to protect the planet.

  DANIEL
     That's why you were watching Teal'c. You thought
     he was a significant threat to planetary security.

  MAN
     Stargate Command may think it's okay to let an
     alien roam the streets unsupervised. We beg to
     differ.

  DANIEL
     And never mind the fact that he's helped save the
     Earth more times than I can count.

  MAN
     He is an alien. Their motives can never be
     trusted. Anyway, he is partly responsible for the
     boyfriend's death. If he hadn't shown the girl how
     to crush a man's windpipe, none of this would have
     happened.

  DANIEL
     So she killed him?

  MAN
     It was self defence really. He was getting out of
     hand.

  DANIEL
     And that's when you guys moved in, you planted
     evidence to make it look like Teal'c did it.

  MAN
     We saw an opportunity and we took it.

  ANNOTATION
     The van drives into a warehouse.


LOCATION--WAREHOUSE

  ANNOTATION
     The van stops and Daniel is helped down onto the
     ground. He is taken further into the biulding,
     passing another man.

  MAN #2
     What the hell's going on here?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is pushed down onto a chair.

  MAN #1
     The situation is under control.

  MAN #2
     You were supposed to get the information and
     leave.

  MAN #1
     He wasn't going to co-operate.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns to look at the two men talking behind
     him.

  MAN #2
     He's a member of SG-1. Do you have any idea what
     kind of resources they'll mobilise to get him
     back?

  MAN #1
     Once we get the translation, it'll be too late.
     Bring the girl!

  ANNOTATION
     One of the men guarding Daniel nods and leaves. A
     woman is standing at a table containing equipment
     and monitors. The two men walk up to face Daniel.


LOCATION--SGC LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working at a monitor when the phone
     rings. She answers it.

  CARTER
     Carter.

  PETE
     Sam, it's me. I traced the car from the pizza
     place. It's a rental. The name on the agreement is
     a fake ID.

  CARTER
     That's our man.

  PETE
     Whoever set this up knew what they were doing.
     I've got a bank account, social security number
     and credit cards all from a guy who died six
     months ago.

  CARTER
     Okay, let's focus on the car. Find out if the
     rental company has satellite tracking.

  PETE
     I'm on it. I'll call you as soon as I have
     something.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista is pulled over to a chair by Daniel.

  KRISTA
     What's happening? Who are these people?

  DANIEL
     It's gonna be okay.

  MAN #2
     The symbols.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out paper and a pen to Daniel.

  MAN #1
     Now. Or we kill the girl.

  DANIEL
     She's got nothing to do with this.

  MAN #2
     Look, Doctor Jackson, if it had been up to me
     things never would have gone this far. It was
     supposed to be a simple surveillance operation.
     But then this little domestic dispute happened,
     and Teal'c got involved. We knew you weren't going
     to help us voluntarily.

  DANIEL
     So you decided to try a little blackmail instead.

  MAN #2
     Let's just say one thing led to another. But in
     any case, it's too late for all that now.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls a gun out of a side holster.

  MAN #2
     So either you give us what we want...

  ANNOTATION
     He cocks the weapon and points it at Krista.

  MAN #2
     ...or I will kill her.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at Krista who is shaking in fear, He
     holds out his hands for the paper.

  MAN #2
     Oh, and by the way? We'll know immediately if the
     symbols are incorrect.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at the man and smiles grimly. He
     works on the translation. Once finished, the
     translation is taken from him and placed into a
     scanner. the woman types at the computer.

  WOMAN
     Scanning. Transmitting symbols. Translation
     confirmed.

  ANNOTATION

  MAN #2
     Good. Get up!

LOCATION--WAREHOUSE

  MAN #2
     Over there, face the wall.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista and Daniel don't move, looking at each
     other worriedly. They are both grabbed and taken
     to stand by the wall.

  DANIEL
     I gave you what you wanted.

  MAN #2
     Move!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns to face the man. The man raises his
     weapon.

  MAN #2
     I said face the wall.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns to the wall.

  DANIEL

     computer, wiping all data. The men and woman
     congregate in a circle.

     Two explosions at the door allow it to be pushed
     open. The armed personnel enter, followed by
     Carter and Pete. The warehouse is empty of peole,
     apart from Daniel and Krista. One of the men
     checks Daniel's pulse as Pete crouches next to
     Krista.

  OFFICER
     He's unconscious. There's no-one here. We've got
     all the exits covered, there's no way they could
     have gotten out.

  PETE
     How is that possible?

  ANNOTATION
     The equipment is being dismantled. Krista and
     Daniel are sitting on chairs, conscious. Daniel is
     rubbing his eyes as Krista is handed a cup of
     water.

  KRISTA
     (to Daniel) Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Pete are standing next to one of the
     vehicles.

  PETE
     So, it's normal for the bad guys to just disappear
     into thin air, right?

  CARTER
     Not really. Although now I think about it, it's
     not the first time it's happened.

  PETE
     Just another day at the office.

  CARTER
     Yes.

  PETE
     Figures you should be used to it by now.

  CARTER
     No, I mean, yes.

  PETE

  CARTER
     Yes.

  PETE
     Are you messing with me?

  CARTER
     No.

  PETE
     Which means?

     Yes.

     Teal'c is packing his vehicle with boxes. Eric is
     rolling his skateboard along the footway. There is
     a box on the skateboard.

  TEAL'C
     Be careful with that package, Eric. Its contents
     are...

  ANNOTATION
     The skateboard falls off the kerb and a sound of
     breaking glass is heard from within the box.

  TEAL'C
     ...fragile.

  ERIC
     Sorry.

  TEAL'C
     There is no need for an apology.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c picks up the box.

  TEAL'C
     I am grateful for your assistance.

  ANNOTATION
     As Teal'c turns to put the box in the vehicle,
     Krista is standing nearby.

  KRISTA
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows his head at her.

  KRISTA
     So, you're really leaving.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed I am.

  KRISTA
     You know, you don't have to do this. The whole
     thing was my fault.

  TEAL'C
     There is no need to blame yourself.

  KRISTA
     The men in the warehouse? I didn't know who they
     were. No-one told me anything. But I know they
     were using me to get to you.

  TEAL'C
     If it had not been you, it would have been someone
     else. They would not hesitate to exploit any
     relationship to their advantage.

  KRISTA
     What did they want?

  TEAL'C
     That I cannot say.

  KRISTA
     Right. So, where are you gonna go?

  TEAL'C
     Back to where I came from.

  KRISTA
     What does that mean?

  TEAL'C
     It means I must say goodbye.

  ANNOTATION
     Krista notices Eric over Teal'c's shoulder. Teal'c
     turns to him. Eric is carrying the fern.

  ERIC
     This is all that was left.

  TEAL'C
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c takes the fern from Eric.

  ERIC
     Check it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Eric shows Teal'c the bottom of his skateboard,
     where Teal'c's forehead symbol has been drawn.

  TEAL'C
     I am honoured.

  ERIC
     Later, dude.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c closes the boot, looks at Krista then gets
     into the car. Eric and Krista watch him drive off.
