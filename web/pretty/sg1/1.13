LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--HAMMOND'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Carrying a clipboard, Harriman crosses the
     Briefing Room and knocks on Hammond's open door.
     After a short pause, he walks in. Hammond is
     seated at his desk, working.

  HARRIMAN
     Readouts on P8X-362, sir. Looks good; especially
     the mineral scans.

  ANNOTATION
     He passes the clipboard to Hammond.

  HAMMOND
     I'll pass this on to SG-4. They'll be geared up
     and ready to for departure by 1100 hours. Thank
     you, Sergeant.

  ANNOTATION
     The SGC klaxons sound. Both men look up.

  GATE TECHNICIAN
     (over loudspeaker) Off-world activation. Repeat,
     off-world activation!

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and Harriman walk out of the office to the
     Briefing Room. Below them, the Stargate is
     spinning. The iris is in place.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  HAMMOND
     Is there anyone due back?

  HARRIMAN
     No, sir.

  GATE TECHNICIAN
     (over loudspeaker) Incoming traveler. Repeat,
     incoming traveler!

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond hurries down the spiral staircase to the
     Control Room, Harriman right behind him. Guards
     rush into 'gate room, weapons aimed at the 'gate.


LOCATION--GATE CONTROL ROOM

  FEMALE TECHNICIAN
     (over loudspeakers in 'gate room) All defense
     teams, stand by!

  ANNOTATION
     An iris code flashes on the screen.
     70629570282002. The computer acknowledges a known
     signal.

  HARRIMAN
     Looks like...SG-1 sir.

  HAMMOND
     Open the Iris.

  ANNOTATION
     The iris opens.

  HAMMOND
     Get a medical team down there!

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond whirls away, moving toward the 'gate room.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Medical team, report to Stargate
     room! Medical team, report to Stargate room!


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Three people stumble out of the wormhole, hanging
     onto each other: O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c;
     they're soaking wet. The soldiers in the 'gate
     room lower their weapons, looking confused.
     Reaching the end of the ramp, the three members of
     SG-1 sit wearily. Hammond walks into the 'gate
     room just as O'Neill puts his head in his hands.

  HAMMOND
     Stand down. (concerned) Colonel O'Neill? SG-1
     couldn't have been deployed more than three hours
     ago. What happened?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes his head, not looking up. Fraiser
     runs into the room, and rushes to O'Neill.

  FRAISER
     Colonel, look at me. Look at me!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill lifts his head from his hands and stares
     at her. It is apparent that all three teammates
     are confused.

  FRAISER
     They're in shock. (to medical team) Get them to
     the infirmary!

  ANNOTATION
     Several medical technicians help pull O'Neill,
     Carter and Teal'c to their feet. They stumble up,
     dazed.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel? Where's Dr. Jackson?

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson...

  CARTER
     He didn't make it, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel's dead, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond looks shocked. O'Neill stares at him,
     blinking.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     A medical technician places the wet uniforms from
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c into a biohazard bag.
     Fraiser walks into the room.

  FRAISER
     All right, I want a complete analysis of these
     uniforms. See if there is any form of
     contamination.

  TECHNICIAN
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser walks to Carter's bed. A male nurse is
     holding her chart. He hands it to Fraiser.

  FRAISER
     What have we got?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is in medical scrubs, a blanket wrapped
     tightly around her. Her knees are bent up to her
     chest, as if for warmth, and she is rocking
     slightly back and forth. Her voice is hoarse.

  CARTER
     He's gone, isn't he? (blinks back tears) Why can't
     I stop shaking?

  FRAISER
     (gently) You're still in shock, Captain. It's all
     right. You're going to be all right. (calls over
     her shoulder) Can I get another warm blanket here,
     please?

  ANNOTATION
     A nurse brings over another blanket and Fraiser
     helps her wrap it around Carter.

  FRAISER
     I just want you to take some slow, deep breaths
     for me.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods and starts do do that, sniffling
     loudly.

  FRAISER
     (to nurse, dismissing her) That's good. (to
     Carter) Can you tell me what happened?

  CARTER
     (scrunches her face) Gunh. He screamed, and...and
     there was this fire, and...he called out for help,
     and then he...screamed...and then he...he was
     gone! He was just...he was just...

  ANNOTATION
     She begins to cry.

  FRAISER
     Shhh. (gently) It's all right, we're going to give
     you a sedative now so you can rest. Nurse? Five
     cc's.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser crosses the room to O'Neill and Teal'c.
     O'Neill, also in surgical scrubs, is sitting on a
     bed, his knees drawn up, his elbows resting on
     them. Teal'c, in a T-shirt and shorts, is
     standing. A nurse is trying to take Teal'c's blood
     pressure. Teal'c pulls out of the blood pressure
     cuff and backs up.

  TEAL'C
     (alarmed) I do not wish this done.

  O'NEILL
     (listlessly) Relax Teal'c, they're just trying to
     take your blood pressure.

  FRAISER
     (to nurse) It's all right, that can wait for now.
     Teal'c, you can go change if you want to.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks away, glaring at the nurse. Fraiser
     turns to O'Neill.

  FRAISER
     Okay...Colonel. (she feels his lymph nodes) Any
     pain? Headache?

  O'NEILL
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser pulls out a penlight.

  FRAISER
     I'd like you to look straight ahead please?

  ANNOTATION
     She turns on the light straight into O'Neill's
     eye. He immediately flinches with pain, pulling
     away.

  O'NEILL
     Wha...! What is that?

  FRAISER
     It's a penlight. I'm sorry, you must be
     photosensitive.

  O'NEILL
     Ya think?

  FRAISER
     It's all right, Colonel. We can do this after the
     debriefing. Or even tomorrow.

  O'NEILL
     (sighs) Thank you.

  FRAISER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets off the bed, but stops after a few
     steps, looking uncertain. He looks like he is
     going to say something to Fraiser but stops
     himself, turns back around, and walks off.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser looks after O'Neill, a worried expression
     on her face.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  TEAL'C
     We went through the Stargate at precisely 0700
     this morning. The world we found on the other side
     appeared to be uninhabited.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is sitting at one end of the table, a
     camera facing him, recording the debriefing.
     Hammond is on the other end of the table, asking
     questions. A young female airman is typing
     Teal'c's words into a laptop computer.

  HAMMOND
     So there was no immediate sign of danger?


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The same set up is in effect. This time, Carter is
     the focus of the camera.

  CARTER
     There were these holes...volcanic gas. I took some
     soil samples to test for minerals. Daniel...

  ANNOTATION
     She mouths a few words, then hesitates, looking
     down.

  HAMMOND
     Take your time.


LOCATION--BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The same set up. O'Neill is now the focus.

  O'NEILL
     He said...He said, 'Colonel, help me.' And then he
     was gone.

  HAMMOND
     Gone?

  O'NEILL
     Engulfed. In fire, sir.

  HAMMOND
     There was nothing you could have done, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     No, I swear to God, sir, I tried to get to him,
     but the heat was...It...It...It blasted toward us
     and...

  HAMMOND
     And what did you do then?

  O'NEILL
     (haltingly) There was a body of water somewhere
     nearby, it was like a lake or a sea, maybe. We all
     submerged ourselves; that's what saved us.

  HAMMOND
     And by then?

  O'NEILL
     By then Daniel was gone, there was nothing we
     could do... Nothing left, sir. I ordered the team
     to evacuate.

  HAMMOND
     We'll send a team through to recover the body.

  O'NEILL
     (loudly, alarmed) No sir! It's...too volatile,
     sir. The whole area was...very unstable.

  HAMMOND
     It's a hard thing, to lose a member of the team,
     Colonel. I've gone through it myself. If there's
     anything I --

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill presses both hands against his temples;
     his face is lined with pain.

  O'NEILL
     (interrupting) Yes sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond nods his head, understanding.

  HAMMOND
     Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gets up immediately and walks out of the
     room. Hammond stays seated, his gaze thoughtful.


LOCATION--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond walks down the stairs. Fraiser meets him
     at the bottom.

  FRAISER
     General? I have a few more tests to run, but I've
     got the results back from my initial exams.

  HAMMOND
     And?

  FRAISER
     Well, except for some minor contusions, uh,
     photosensitivity , which I can probably blame on
     exposure to volcanic gasses in the
     atmosphere...they're fine. Frankly, General, I am
     more worried about their post-traumatic symptoms.

  HAMMOND
     When your lives depend on each other, you form
     very deep bonds. Theirs is a very dangerous job.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond turns and walks down the stairs. Fraiser
     follows him as they walk through the corridors.

  FRAISER
     Well yes. of course sir. It's just, I...I can't
     help but be concerned. Call it intuition--

  HAMMOND
     (interrupting) The best thing we can do is get
     them on another mission. I plan to put them back
     in the rotation as soon as I can assign a
     replacement for Dr. Jackson.

  FRAISER
     (sharply) No sir, I don't agree. I want to keep
     them under observation for several days at least.

  HAMMOND
     In my experience, Doctor, it's best for the
     surviving members of the team to go--

  FRAISER
     (interrupting) Sir, with all due respect, your
     experience doesn't include 'gate travel to another
     planet.

  ANNOTATION
     They begin to speak more softly as they realize
     they can be overheard by passing staff members.

  FRAISER
     Nether does anyone else's experience for that
     matter. Several days at least. I insist.

  HAMMOND
     Very well, I'll put them on stand-down for seven
     days.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond steps into the elevator.

  FRAISER
     Thank you, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond nods, dismissing her as the elevator
     closes.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DUSK


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A Color Guard consisting of four solders marches
     into the 'gate room. The first one is carrying a
     rifle, the second a US flag, the third an SGC
     flag, the fourth another rifle. SGC staff, in full
     dress uniform, are standing in ranks along the
     wall. There is a podium at the end of the 'gate
     ramp. Hammond, O'Neill, Teal'c, Carter and Fraiser
     stand beside the podium. The Color Guard marches
     into place, filling the space between the podium
     and the ranks of SGC staff. They put the flags
     into place, then march to participate in the
     flag-folding ceremony. Blue light from the
     wormhole reflects over the scene. Four soldiers on
     the ramp fold a large US flag into the proper
     memorial triangle. As they fold, Hammond prompts
     O'Neill to deliver the eulogy.

  HAMMOND
     Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill steps to the podium.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel Jackson...made this place...happen. As a
     member of SG-1...he was our voice; our conscience.
     He was a very courageous man. He was a good man.
     For those of us lucky enough to have known him, he
     was also a friend.

  ANNOTATION
     The flag is completely folded; there is a brief
     ceremony as the honor guard places the flag into
     O'Neill's possession. Teal'c is next given the
     flag, which he holds to his chest. O'Neill salutes
     and pivots. Carter falls into step beside O'Neill;
     together they march up the ramp towards the open
     Stargate. Taps is playing in the background.
     Carter and O'Neill pick up a memorial wreath at
     the top of the ramp, and place just inside the
     event horizon. The wormhole keeps it in place
     momentarily, then it disappears into the wormhole.

  HAMMOND
     (at the podium) We commend Daniel Jackson's spirit
     to the Universe he opened up for us.

  ANNOTATION
     As the wreath disappears into the Stargate,
     O'Neill and Carter salute.

  HAMMOND
     I pledge to continue our journey of discovery in
     his memory. May he rest in peace.

  ANNOTATION
     Taps finishes.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is lying at the bottom of some steps;
     coughing. He is soaking wet. He pushes himself to
     his feet, looking around. The room is full of
     windows looking out at an underwater jungle of
     plants. Some kind of seaweed is growing through
     cracks in the floor and walls. Bubbles rise inside
     a spherical ball behind him; the sound of water
     moving is loud.

  DANIEL
     (shouting) Jack? Sam? Teal'c? (softly) ...anyone?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks scared; it's obvious that he's alone.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOME, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter walk down the sidewalk and up
     the walk to O'Neill's house. Inside the house, SGC
     staff, in civilian clothing, are gathered. People
     are drinking and eating, sharing stories of
     Daniel.

  O'NEILL
     (to a woman) So we're sitting around eating some
     kind of gourmet Abydonian cuisine. Daniel tells
     Sha're he's going to show us this cartouche thing,
     but before we leave, she stands up and plants a
     kiss on him that makes his face disappear for a
     day.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill grins at the memory. He places a dish on
     the table then walks out of the room, the woman
     following him. Carter and Teal'c enter; Carter is
     fidgeting with a bottle of wine. Teal'c wears a
     straw hat that covers the emblem on his forehead.

  TEAL'C
     (disapprovingly) I do not understand this ritual.

  CARTER
     It's called a wake.

  TEAL'C
     On Chu'lak when someone dies, it is the custom to
     not eat for three days and nights.

  CARTER
     Yeah, well...a wake is like a big party; supposed
     to give the departed a jolly send off.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill calls from the table in the living room,
     where he is opening a bottle of beer.

  O'NEILL
     Sam, Teal'c. Glad you made it. Something to drink?

  CARTER
     Yeah, sure. Beer.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

  TEAL'C
     I must refrain.

  O'NEILL
     There's food upstairs.

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill pours Carter's beer, the foam rises.
     O'Neill freezes, suddenly trapped in the middle of
     a flashback.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Bubbles rise in orange-tinted water; the bubbles
     turn into a fire with Daniel standing in the
     middle, looking frightened.

  DANIEL
     (screaming) Help! Jack! Help! Help!

  ANNOTATION
     The beer reaches the top of the glass, and O'Neill
     snaps out of it. He places the glass on the table
     and strides out of the house. Carter and Teal'c
     look worried as they watch him leave; then they
     look at each other.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel squeezes water from his SGC jacket. Feeling
     a presence behind him, he slowly turns. A large,
     non-human, bipedal creature with bluish mottled
     skin and an elaborate costume is standing behind
     him, staring. Daniel stares at him, speechless for
     a moment.

  DANIEL
     (tapping himself on the chest) Daniel. Daniel
     Jackson. You? (after no response, starting again)
     My friends, the...the others who came here with
     me...

  ANNOTATION
     Nem points, and a panel in the wall slides open.
     It's covered with writing, which lights up when
     exposed. Daniel looks at the wall then at NEM, not
     sure what to do. Nem points at the wall. Daniel
     shrugs and walks over to the exposed writing,
     studying it intently. He turns back to Nem.

  DANIEL
     It...it's a very old Earth writing. It's
     Cuneiform. (gestures to the writing) It...It's the
     first kind of writing we ever found on...on my
     world.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at Nem, who points insistently at the
     wall. Daniel examines it again.

  DANIEL
     Okay. It's Akkadian, not Sumerian, so... It's a
     tough one. Let me think. (clears his throat)
     'Reveal...Fate...Om..more..ocka.' Reveal fate
     Omoroca. Reveal fate Omoroca? Omoroca, what is
     that? (raises his eyebrows) That's you?

  ANNOTATION
     Nem walks up so he is almost touching Daniel. He
     stares at him intently, hopefully.

  DANIEL
     No...something else? Reveal fate Omoroca. I'm
     sorry I don't know what you want me to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem explodes with anger; he screams and lifts his
     hand. A bright light shoots out of his palm at
     DAniel, who is sent flying across the room. He
     hits a wall and falls into a heap on the floor.
     Nem stands over him, showing his teeth, panting.

  DANIEL
     (desperate) I don't know what you want me to do! I
     don't understand!

  ANNOTATION
     Nem growls, his face ferocious. Daniel huddles on
     the floor, clearly trying not to anger the
     creature further.


LOCATION--O'NEILL'S HOME, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The wake is still going on inside. O'Neill is
     armed with a hockey stick. He has a net set up
     between two cars, and is shooting a line of orange
     plastic balls into the net. One especially hard
     hit topples the net. O'Neill bangs on the fallen
     net with his stick, then whirls around and slams
     the hockey stick through the driver's side window
     of one of the cars.

  O'NEILL
     (furious) Come get this damn car out of here!

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and Carter look up at the sudden noise.
     Hammond, mouthing "what the...?" walks over to
     join O'Neill, surveying the car and the shattered
     glass littering the driveway. Most of the guests
     try to ignore the scene, but Carter and Teal'c
     watch.

  HAMMOND
     What on your mind, Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) Retirement, actually.

  HAMMOND
     You don't mean that.

  O'NEILL
     (sighs) I think I do.

  HAMMOND
     Well, I can't let you do that at the moment. I've
     got an assignment for SG-1. Dr. Jackson's
     apartment needs to be closed by Stargate
     personnel. National security aside, you're
     probably the closest thing he had to a family.
     It's not an order, it's a request.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  HAMMOND
     (concerned) Why don't you come join the others in
     the back?

  O'NEILL
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leads O'Neill back to the house.

  HAMMOND
     You know that's my car, don't you?

  O'NEILL
     You should get that window fixed.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel seems to have made some progress; more of
     the writing is exposed.

  DANIEL
     'If a free man...accuses another of murder, and
     fails to prove, the accuser shall be put to
     death.' Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns to look at Nem, who is standing
     silent, observing him.

  DANIEL
     That's interesting, but what the hell does it
     mean?

  ANNOTATION
     Nem points to the writing.

  DANIEL
     (frustrated) Yeah, yeah. I...I know, I know what
     it is; it is...it's the legal code of some ancient
     Babylonian king, probably 2000 B.C. The question
     is--what does it have to do with me?

  ANNOTATION
     Nem stares at him. This time, Daniel stares right
     back, his gaze a challenge.

  DANIEL
     I want to see my friends. I'm not...I'm not going
     to translate another word of this until you let
     me--

  NEM
     What...speech?

  DANIEL
     (shocked) What? (he gestures to the writing)
     What...this one? Uh...it's Akkadian.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem taps Daniel on the shoulder.

  NEM
     What...speech?

  DANIEL
     Oh, uh, oh, English. It's-- it's much more
     modern...

  NEM
     What...fate...Omoroca?

  DANIEL
     I--I don't--I don't--I don't know. Look, my
     friends and I, we came here in peace. We're--we're
     explorers. We'll share information if we have it.

  NEM
     What fate Omoroca?

  DANIEL
     I--I--I--I don't--I don't know!

  ANNOTATION
     Nem groans then walks to the other side of the
     room. Daniel watches him, seemingly divided
     between anger and worry. Near the doorway, Nem
     pulls a lever. A small opening appears, with a
     small container inside.

  NEM
     Nourishment.

  ANNOTATION
     He pushes another button, and a long, clear
     surface slides out of the wall.

  NEM
     Sleep.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem walks toward the exit but pauses when Daniel
     speaks.

  DANIEL
     (desperate) Look, um, I can't...I can't tell you
     what I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem turns.

  NEM
     You will. Or you will die!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel's eyes widen; he looks at Nem. His mouth
     moves but no words come out.


LOCATION--APARTMENT BUILDING--DAY


LOCATION--DANIEL'S APARTMENT

  ANNOTATION
     There are bookcases everywhere, stuffed with
     books. Artifacts from all over the world cover
     every surface. Carter is going through a bookcase
     along one wall. O'Neill is examining something by
     the fireplace. Teal'c is standing by the window,
     turning something over in his hands. There are
     several cardboard boxes on the floor, but they
     don't appear to have much in them.

  CARTER
     Oh wow, look at these. Expedition journals, one
     for each planet we visited. (pulling out a
     journal) One for Abydos.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter opens the journal and begins to read. A
     smile crosses her face and she chuckles. She reads
     aloud.

  CARTER
     'Colonel O'Neill thinks I'm a geek. I have no idea
     how to get us back. I'll never get paid.'

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks over at O'Neill, he rubs a hand over
     his face and doesn't comment. She turns the page
     and begins reading again.

  CARTER
     Oh wow, he must have written this right after we
     got back. 'Sha're is gone, Jack says we'll find
     her. If anyone can, he can.'

  O'NEILL
     (disapproving) Ah, come on, that's his diary. I
     mean, what's he going to think if--

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stops, both he and Carter look uneasy. She
     puts the book back on the shelf.

  CARTER
     Wonder what they're going to do with all this
     stuff.

  O'NEILL
     Maybe give it to a museum? Or start one.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is bent over some kind of game board, with
     holes for movement. Several cartouches are
     inscribed down the center. Pegs with heads like
     jackals and hounds are randomly placed, stopped in
     the middle of a game. Teal'c rubs a hand across
     the board then picks up one of the hound-headed
     game pieces.

  TEAL'C
     This is a game from ancient Egypt. It is called
     the Jackal and the Hound. It belonged to a
     Pharaoh's daughter.

  ANNOTATION
     Across the room, Carter is looking at DANIEL'S
     fish tank.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson and I once played. He said it made
     him feel as though he were touching history.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter's gaze has become fixated on the bubbles in
     the fish tank. They trigger a sudden flashback.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Orange bubbles rise, and suddenly, Daniel is
     there, engulfed in fire.

  DANIEL
     Help! Help!

  ANNOTATION
     There's a splash, and a rush of blue water.

  CARTER
     Whoa!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pushes away from the fish tank, her face
     shocked. O'Neill grabs her by the upper arms.

  O'NEILL
     What? What is it? You all right?

  CARTER
     Uh, I...I just had this image in my mind. It's the
     second time.

  O'NEILL
     What was it?

  CARTER
     Water...underwat...

  O'NEILL
     Bubbles rising?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  TEAL'C
     That is correct, I have experienced it as well.

  O'NEILL
     I'm telling you, something's wrong.

  CARTER
     Yeah, what's wrong here, Colonel, is that Daniel
     is dead.

  O'NEILL
     Is he?

  CARTER
     You were there. We were all there!

  O'NEILL
     Then why don't I believe it? I mean, I keep
     expecting him to walk through the door! I-- I-- I
     keep getting these... (working his mouth, bouncing
     on his heels, looking up at the ceiling, around
     the room.) Screw this packing, let's get back to
     the base.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads toward the door of the apartment.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, Nem approaches. Clearly, there is
     water on the other side of the door, kept out of
     the underwater room by some kind of energy
     barrier. He walks over to Daniel, who is resting
     wearily on the steps, his head in his hands.
     Daniel looks up at Nem.

  DANIEL
     Where are my friends? Are they alive? Are they
     here somewhere? I demand that I be allowed to
     speak with them.

  NEM
     They are gone.

  DANIEL
     (shakes his head) No. (he rises to his feet,
     pointing at Nem) They would not leave without me.

  NEM
     You are no more.

  DANIEL
     Wha-- They think that I'm--

  NEM
     This memory I gave them, so they would not return.

  DANIEL
     (despairingly) Why? Why are you doing this?

  NEM
     You are oldest. You know of Babylon. What fate
     Omoroca?

  DANIEL
     Okay. Okay. If my life is on the line here, I need
     to know more. What is Omoroca? Who is Omoroca?

  NEM
     (emotionally) My mate!

  DANIEL
     (in disbelief) What? On Earth? In-- in Babylon?

  NEM
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     And you don't know what's happened to her? That
     was four thousand years ago.

  NEM
     Knowledge. You have knowledge!

  DANIEL
     Of Babylon, yes! But only a-- a small amount of
     knowledge has survived all that time!

  NEM
     The knowledge is there.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem slaps one hand against Daniel's temple. Daniel
     freezes, watching him warily.

  NEM
     In your mind.

  DANIEL
     Okay, you are asking me to remember something--
     that happened thousands and thousands of years
     before I was born. To-- to tell you something,
     that I-- I couldn't possibly know!

  NEM
     You deceive!

  DANIEL
     (angrily) Why? God, why, why, why would I do that?

  NEM
     You serve the Goa'uld!

  DANIEL
     No! No! Now I lost my wife, my-- my mate, because
     of the Goa'uld! They took her from me, and I
     despise them for that!

  NEM
     Then tell me what fate?

  DANIEL
     I don't know!!

  ANNOTATION
     Nem growls in frustration. Obviously angry, he
     turns and walks away from Daniel.

  DANIEL
     (shouting) I don't know!


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c are gathered around
     Fraiser.

  FRAISER
     Well, your brain chemistry's been seriously
     compromised. All of you have abnormally low levels
     of serotonin.

  O'NEILL
     Which means...?

  FRAISER
     It's a neurotransmitter that effects moods. Now,
     low levels would account for depression, but not
     these other effects. Come here. I want you to take
     a look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser leads them to a computer. On screen is a
     model of a human brain. She points, outlining an
     area with her finger.

  FRAISER
     This dark spot here appears on all of your scans.
     Now, it's almost too small an anomaly to worry
     about but for the fact that it's in virtually the
     same part of the cortex--

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm klaxon sounds. O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter
     immediately rush from the room.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over loudspeaker) Off world activation. Repeat,
     off world activation!

  FRAISER
     Colonel? Wait!

  ANNOTATION
     Fraiser runs after SG-1, motioning for a nurse and
     a guard in the corridor.

  FRAISER
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     All three run after SG-1, who come to a stop in
     the 'gate room.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c watch with smiles as a
     man who appears to be Daniel walks down the ramp
     and takes off his helmet. He turns and looks at
     them. Fraiser runs into the room.

  FRAISER
     Colonel?

  ANNOTATION
     The smiles die as the man turns; it's not Daniel,
     but an older, bald soldier, who stares at them,
     expressionless.

  TECHNICIAN
     (over intercom) Welcome home, SG-6. Report for
     debriefing at 1600 hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Several soldiers walk past them; the man who they
     thought was Daniel leaves the room with them.

  FRAISER
     What...what are you looking for?

  O'NEILL
     (confused) I just...I thought that--

  TEAL'C
     (frowning) Daniel Jackson was returning.

  CARTER
     Oh my God, I thought the same thing. Why? Is he
     gone, or isn't he?

  FRAISER
     (carefully) You-- you saw it happen.

  O'NEILL
     Somebody want to tell me what the hell is going
     on? Because I am starting to lose it here.

  HAMMOND
     Doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond enters the 'gate room.

  FRAISER
     General, uh-- there seems to be some question in
     their minds as to whether or not Dr. Jackson is
     dead.

  HAMMOND
     Well, you three were the only witnesses. If you're
     denying what you saw--

  O'NEILL
     No sir. I saw him die. We all did. I know he's
     gone. (hesitates) But I know he's still alive.
     (determined) Sir, we have got to go ba--

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill suddenly cries out in pain; he grasps his
     head and presses his hands against his temples.

  HAMMOND
     You're not going anywhere but the Infirmary!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and a nurse help O'Neill out of the 'gate
     room. Hammond turns to Fraiser.

  HAMMOND
     I want to know what's going on, Doctor. One of our
     people could still be out there.

  FRAISER
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     As Fraiser follows SG-1 out of the 'gate room,
     Hammond turns to look at the silent Stargate.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is searching for a way out, trying to work
     the latch on the door. He thumps the door and the
     wall around it. He turns as there's an odd noise.
     Nem comes in through another entrance. He has
     dispensed with the impressive and intimidating
     outfit from earlier. His clothing now looks more
     utilitarian.

  NEM
     You cannot leave this place.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel rolls his eyes and thunks his head against
     the wall.

  NEM
     You will tell me all you know of Babylon.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sits down on the floor and gazes bleakly at
     Nem.

  DANIEL
     Do you know how much has been lost? Great
     libraries burned to the ground; cities destroyed
     by wars. Most of our history is buried in time.

  NEM
     You are afraid.

  DANIEL
     (quietly) Yes, I'm afraid. I'm afraid that you're
     asking the impossible of me and you will not allow
     me return home.

  NEM
     Omoroca was afraid.

  DANIEL
     On Earth?

  NEM
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     (waving his arms in frustration) Of what? Of who?
     I mean...give me something to work with here; a--
     a time frame!

  NEM
     Babylon.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel closes his eyes and lets his head fall
     backward to hit the wall. He shakes his head. Nem
     continues to stare.

  DANIEL
     A-- a name, a name of someone she spoke of.

  NEM
     Belus.

  DANIEL
     Belus. Belus... (concentrating, to dredge up any
     memories) Belus...Something...Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gets to his feet, approaching Nem to study
     him.

  DANIEL
     Yes...um...Belus something. Yes. In the writing of
     Berossus, a contemporary of Alexander the Great.
     He studied some very old, ancient Babylonian text.
     Pre-flood. (he makes a wordless sound of
     exasperation) Tell me more.

  NEM
     Omoroca feared Belus.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel starts pacing around the small space. Nem
     watches him closely.

  DANIEL
     Yes. Yes, he was a conqueror. Tell me more; I need
     more.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem stares at him blankly.

  DANIEL
     Come on...Come on, you cannot expect me to
     remember every book, every text that I studied ten
     or twelve years ago! Look, come back to Earth with
     me. My-- my books, my library, they're all there!

  NEM
     (angrily) You serve the Goa'uld!

  DANIEL
     (using his hands for emphasis) NO! God, no! How
     many times do I have to tell you? No!

  NEM
     It is the fate of humans. That, Omoroca could not
     prevent.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem walks towards Daniel, who stares at him with
     sudden curiosity.

  DANIEL
     Omoroca came to Earth to fight the Goa'uld? That
     is why she came to Earth?

  NEM
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     Then my people owe her a great debt.

  NEM
     She failed!

  DANIEL
     No. No, there was a...an uprising, a rebellion in
     Ancient Egypt. I mean, maybe she helped plant the
     seed.

  NEM
     Goa'uld are among you, within you!

  DANIEL
     (realization dawns) Teal'c? You think because
     Teal'c carries around a larval Goa'uld...? No, you
     see he joined us in the fight against the Goa'uld.
     You see, in the years-- in the thousands of years,
     since Omoroca was there; we have become a
     civilization that rivals that of the Goa'uld.
     That's how far we've come. We are free! If-- if
     you'd just come back with me, I can show you!

  ANNOTATION
     Nem searches Daniel's face. His expression is
     confused, but only for a moment. His face hardens.

  NEM
     Knowledge is here!

  ANNOTATION
     This time, Nem wraps both hands around Daniel's
     head. Daniel stares at him.


LOCATION--SCG BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A tape recorder is playing the sound of waves
     crashing on the shore. O'Neill and Teal'c are
     seated on one side of the table, Hammond is at the
     head. MacKenzie, Carter and Fraiser are on the
     other side.

  O'NEILL
     Catchy tune. Want to explain to me what
     this...mood music is all about?

  HAMMOND
     Dr. Mackenzie said it might help you remember more
     specifically what happened, if you listen.

  MACKENZIE
     We're simply using these sounds as a tool to
     increase your level of concentration, Colonel.

  O'NEILL
     Well, it's very distracting. Look, we're trying to
     play b--

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stops, distracted by Teal'c, who is
     staring into space, a deeper frown than usual on
     his face.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, listening to the sound of water, has a
     flashback.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Among orange bubbles that turn into fire, Daniel
     screams.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c jumps to his feet, shouting something in
     Goa'uld. O'Neill quickly stands up and put an arm
     around Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, snap out of it!

  ANNOTATION
     Mackenzie looks intrigued.

  TEAL'C
     I saw the death of Daniel Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Mackenzie turns off the recorder and makes a
     notation.

  O'NEILL
     (gently) It's all right. The same thing keeps
     happening to me.

  MACKENZIE
     All three of you have conflicting feeling about
     Daniel.

  CARTER
     I know he's dead; I know he's alive.

  MACKENZIE
     Both realities can't be true, yet both seem to be.

  HAMMOND
     It's a conflict that will have to be resolved,
     before I'll authorize your return back to active
     duty, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c sinks down to his seat. O'Neill blinks,
     then nods.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting on the floor. Nem towers over
     him, watching.

  DANIEL
     My friends, the others who came here with me...you
     made them think that I was...

  NEM
     Lost to them.

  DANIEL
     Dead.

  NEM
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     How?

  NEM
     I gave them the memory of your death.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel rises to his feet, approaching Nem.

  DANIEL
     If you can influence memory like that, why don't
     you search my mind? You say the memory is in
     there; that I must have come across it years ago
     and I-- I just don't remember it.

  NEM
     Yes.

  DANIEL
     Then take it! I mean, if you have the power, if
     you have the technology, use it.

  NEM
     (hesitating) It would damage!

  DANIEL
     Well, given my options, I am willing to take the
     risk.

  NEM
     I am not.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel searches Nem's face. Nem turns and walks
     away, his face downcast. Daniel places a hand on
     his shoulder, stopping him.

  DANIEL
     Look...

  ANNOTATION
     Nem turns his head to look at Daniel; Daniel looks
     down at his hand, then removes it.

  DANIEL
     I don't have four thousand years. Maybe you can
     afford to search all that time, but I can't.

  NEM
     There will be much pain. You may die.

  DANIEL
     Well, I would rather die than stay here in the
     knowledge that I would never see my wife or my
     friends again.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem and Daniel stare at each other wordlessly.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c, Hammond, MacKenzie, Carter and
     Fraiser are still seated in the same positions.

  O'NEILL
     The uh, fire Daniel was caught in, lashed out
     toward us...overwhelmed us when we went to
     help...It was...hot...It was very hot...Uh...there
     was water, a body-- a body of water nearby. Sir,
     how many times are we going to have to go through
     this?

  HAMMOND
     Try to bear with me, Colonel. How long do you
     estimate you were on the other side of the 'gate?

  O'NEILL
     Umm...twenty minutes...twenty-five maybe.

  CARTER
     Half hour, tops.

  HAMMOND
     Teal'c?

  TEAL'C
     I concur.

  HAMMOND
     You were gone almost four hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Carter and O'Neill look at Hammond with
     astonishment.

  CARTER
     I don't think that's possible, sir.

  HAMMOND
     I can show you the mission logs if you want.

  O'NEILL
     What happened to the other three and a half hours?

  MACKENZIE
     I have had a great deal of success with hypnosis.

  O'NEILL
     Hypnosis. You know, I am not a big fan of that
     bark like a chicken, cluck like a dog stuff.

  FRAISER
     Colonel, please. Hypnosis is a modern therapeutic
     practice.

  TEAL'C
     On me, I do not believe your procedure will be
     successful.

  O'NEILL
     General, can't we go about this the old-fashioned
     way? Request permission to go back through that
     'gate, and find out what the hell happened.

  TEAL'C
     (shouting) No!!!

  CARTER
     Sir, we can't do that! (gazing at the people
     watching her reaction) I-- I don't know why I just
     said that.

  MACKENZIE
     If that isn't a conditioned response, I don't know
     what is.

  O'NEILL
     So...someone's been messing with our heads.

  MACKENZIE
     There is one way to find out.

  ANNOTATION
     MacKenzie stares at O'Neill, who looks away.

  CARTER
     Colonel, I've had some experience with hypnosis in
     an undergrad psych course. Let me take a shot at
     it.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Hammond look to O'Neill, who raises a
     hand in surrender. Carter nods.

  CARTER
     (to Mackenzie) I volunteer.

  ANNOTATION
     MacKenzie nods; O'Neill looks at them.


LOCATION--SGC--LABORATORY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is seated under a lamp; her eyes closed.
     MacKenzie is sitting to her left. O'Neill is
     tucked into a corner behind them.

  MACKENZIE
     You're now completely relaxed. I want you to go
     back to the day you last saw Daniel. He's with you
     now. Can you see it?

  CARTER
     Yes.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Flashback of Daniel standing in fire.

  CARTER
     (jumping) Burning!

  MACKENZIE
     No. Go back further. You've just arrived. Now look
     around, and tell me where you are.

  FLASHBACK


  ANNOTATION
     Carter flashes on a sea.

  CARTER
     Water.

  MACKENZIE
     You're standing next to water?

  CARTER
     Salt water.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--OANNES BEACH, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 is walking on through dunes, approaching a
     beach. The sky is very blue, and there are two
     moons in the background. Flames occasionally erupt
     from mini-volcanoes scattered across the land.

  O'NEILL
     Looks like some kind of...ocean.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter drops her helmet and collects several
     samples of the sand. Daniel scans the beach with a
     small video camera. He stops when something in the
     water catches his attention.

  DANIEL
     What-- what's that thing out there?

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 study the ocean. Bubbles in the water move in
     a direct path toward the beach. Daniel starts to
     film again. There's a quick movement, and
     something green, similar to a fin or an arm comes
     out of the water behind the bubbles. Daniel drops
     the camera, looking at his teammates.

  DANIEL
     Did you see that?

  CARTER
     It's coming right towards us.

  ANNOTATION
     The bubbles grow closer, then Nem suddenly walks
     out of the water onto the beach. O'Neill and
     Teal'c grip their weapons purposefully, aiming
     them at the creature. Nem pauses to study Daniel,
     then looks over the rest of the team. His
     attention seems to be caught by Teal'c. Nem passes
     Daniel to place his hand over the place where
     Teal'c's pouch contains his symbiote. He looks up
     quickly at Teal'c's face, then backs away. Beside
     Daniel, Nem bends down and writes something in the
     sand. Cuneiform. Daniel studies the writing, then
     looks up at Nem with astonishment.

  DANIEL
     Uh, it's-- it's Cuneiform. I think he wants to
     know if we're from the world that built Babylon.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel bends down and writes a reply. Nem studies
     what Daniel wrote, then looks up at Teal'c. Daniel
     rises to his feet, smiling.

  DANIEL
     I'm-- I'm Daniel, this is Jack--

  ANNOTATION
     Nem screams, raising his hand to shoot a beam of
     white light at SG-1. They fall to the ground,
     covering their ears.

  CARTER
     (crying, desperate) Help him!

  MACKENZIE
     I want you to move on to what happened next.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter concentrates.

LOCATION--NEM'S CHAMBER

  ANNOTATION
     Carter sees water.

  CARTER
     (in present) Darkness...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is lying on a clear table with straps
     across her forehead, chin, arms and legs.
     Machinery is around her. Her eyes are open, but
     not focused on anything.

  CARTER
     (in present) Cold...

  ANNOTATION
     Bubbles rise to the top of a large tube.

  CARTER
     (in present) Wet...

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is secured in the same manner. The bubbles
     turn orange as they rise. O'Neill appears to be
     upright, but he is strapped to the table in the
     same fashion. The bubbles rise, this time they're
     green. Behind the bubbles, Nem is staring at
     Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     In the present, Carter jumps, crying out.

  CARTER
     We've got to get to the water!

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--OANNES SEA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     There's the sound of violent water movement.
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter follow a trail of
     bubbles and pop to the surface of the sea; they
     swim frantically back toward shore.

  MACKENZIE
     Captain!

  ANNOTATION
     In the lab, Carter has jumped from the chair.

  CARTER
     We've got to get out of here!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter seems hysterical. O'Neill grabs her by the
     shoulders, shaking her.

  O'NEILL
     Carter!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter blinks, coming back to realization. She's
     has tears on her face and seems to be
     hyperventilating.

  CARTER
     Oh my God, Colonel. We left him behind! Left him
     behind!

  O'NEILL
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pulls Carter into a hug.

  O'NEILL
     It's all right. We're going back...We're going
     back.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is strapped into the plastic chair from
     Carter's memories. Around it, the frame is
     circular, and Daniel is in a seated position, held
     in place with clear straps across his forehead,
     chin, wrists and ankles. Nem is standing beside
     the machine. Daniel looks nervous, but determined.

  NEM
     The memory of your history, your race, is within
     you. Beneath the surface.

  DANIEL
     I hope so.

  NEM
     You may be damaged.

  DANIEL
     I understand.

  NEM
     You could die.

  DANIEL
     Well, we don't really have a choice, do we?

  ANNOTATION
     Nem studies Daniel for a moment, then turns away.
     He walks to the control panel.

  NEM
     Remember Omoroca.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem turns on the machine. There's a low humming
     sound; two bright lights appear, shining down on
     the area around Daniel's head. Daniel closes his
     eyes.

  DANIEL
     Omoroca. (grunting in pain) Omoroca. (gasping)
     'And in that place there was Omoroca... A woman
     who came forth from the heavenly egg...' (crying
     out) ...Unh...unh...I can't!

  NEM
     More.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem turns up the machine. The whine of power
     increases.

  DANIEL
     I can't!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gasps, but concentrates again. His
     breathing becomes tortured, but he continues.

  DANIEL
     'Who walked among men by day...but at night...she
     would retreat to the great sea to sleep.' (gasps)
     'One of the beings called Oannes...'

  NEM
     Yes...

  DANIEL
     Omoroca...

  NEM
     Yes...

  DANIEL
     Omoroca?

  NEM
     More!

  ANNOTATION
     Nem turns the beam up higher. The pitch is painful
     in itself. Daniel grimaces with pain.

  DANIEL
     Unh...unh...unh....'The God Belus came down unto
     Babylon...onto the place of Omoroca...and cut the
     woman asunder!' Oh God!!! Unh! Oh God, he killed
     her! Unh, unh, unh...

  ANNOTATION
     Nem looks shocked, staring at Daniel in horror.
     Daniel screams in pain, and Nem shakes himself and
     manages to turn off the machine. Nem rushes to
     free Daniel, who is gasping with pain and crying.

  DANIEL
     Unh...I'm...I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's all I
     ever knew, I swear.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, still breathing hard, turns to looks at
     Nem, sympathy in his eyes.

  NEM
     Belus.

  DANIEL
     He was a Goa'uld.

  NEM
     (screaming) Yes. He murdered my love!

  ANNOTATION
     Nem trembles with his emotions. Daniel gazes at
     him, raising his head from the chair.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem shakes his head, then raises it and screams
     with grief and rage.


LOCATION--OANNES BEACH, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter run between the mini
     volcanoes toward the ocean. They stop just out of
     reach of the waves.

  O'NEILL
     (shouting) Daniel!

  CARTER
     Maybe we're too late.

  O'NEILL
     We're not leaving without him this time, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear the sound of water bubbling. All three
     aim their weapons at the trail of bubbles coming
     closer.


LOCATION--OANNES, NEM'S UNDERSEA ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is standing at the window; the door has
     been opened. He blows on and then touches the
     surface, and his hand goes into the water. Taking
     a deep breath, Daniel walks into the water and
     swims away, toward the surface.


LOCATION--OANNES BEACH, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The bubbles stop, and Nem surfaces and walks
     toward Teal'c. All three solders aim their
     weapons, ready to fire. Before they can say
     anything Daniel bursts out of the water, gasping
     for air. O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter look at him
     with startled surprise.

  DANIEL
     Don't shoot!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel coughs and swims to them. He stumbles out
     of the water and onto the beach, moving to stand
     before Nem.

  DANIEL
     Nem, you have your answer. Now let us go.

  ANNOTATION
     As Daniel stares at him, pleading, Nem turns to
     look at his teammates. He looks back to Daniel.

  NEM
     You may go.

  DANIEL
     I'm sorry I couldn't give you the answer you
     wanted.

  NEM
     I am sorry also.

  DANIEL
     We could still become friends, your people and--
     and mine.

  CARTER
     That's why we were here; we meant no harm.

  NEM
     Perhaps, in time.

  DANIEL
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Nem turns back to look intently at Daniel.

  NEM
     And in time, Daniel, you will find...what fate
     Sha're.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel nods uncertainly. The team watches silently
     as Nem heads back into the water. He dives back
     into the sea and disappears. Daniel looks at his
     team. O'Neill shakes his head, his sunglasses
     hiding his eyes. Carter smiles. They walk to
     encircle him.

  DANIEL
     Ah, this-- this is a long story.

  CARTER
     Yeah, I'll bet!

  O'NEILL
     Tell us about it over Sushi?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stares, momentarily speechless, at O'Neill,
     who's laughing.

  DANIEL
     That's funny. Uh, I will, after I go get some
     sleep.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel heads for the Stargate. His team walks
     around him, smiling.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, home. Yeah about that apartment...

  DANIEL
     Oh, you didn't!

  CARTER
     The, um, day after the memorial service.

  DANIEL
     (disbelieving) The memorial service?

  CARTER
     The Colonel said some really nice things.

  DANIEL
     He-- he did. He did?

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 walks across the dunes in the direction of
     the Stargate.
