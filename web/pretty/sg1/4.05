<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>ANISE: It is difficult to prove because of the lack of evidence. I believe violent self-destructive behaviour is an integral part of the programming meant to ensure that result.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>MARTOUF: In 2000 years, the Tok'ra have never bowed to Goa'uld terrorism. We will not start now.</td></tr>
