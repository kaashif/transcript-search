Arthur's Mantle
TEASER

LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Vala, Daniel, and Mitchell talk at Daniel's desk.

  MITCHELL
     Merlin? King Arthur and the Knights of the Round
     Table? Merlin?

  DANIEL
     Yes.

  MITCHELL
     Was an Ancient?

  DANIEL
     I think so.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel briefs Mitchell, Landry, Teal'c, and Vala
     on the Arthurian legend.

  LANDRY
     What does this have to do with where this alleged
     treasure was buried?

  DANIEL
     (voiceover) Certain threads point to the Knights
     of the Round Table gathering great treasures from
     the far corners of Arthur's domain and hiding them
     in a magical stronghold at Avalon.


LOCATION--AVALON CAVES

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell picks up the sword returns it to the
     stone, sliding it easily into the rock. Once
     replaced, the chamber fills with gold urns, vases,
     statues, goblets, coins, jewels and other
     treasures. Mitchell looks around.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell moves on his knees, grabs Volnek's staff
     weapon, turns, and shoots Volnek in the abdomen.
     (The staff weapon is smaller than the typical
     Jaffa weapon, but has the same type of fire.)
     Volnek falls onto his back.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

  TEAL'C
     (voiceover) All free Jaffa have always had the
     greatest respect for the warriors of the Sodan.

  ANNOTATION
     Jolan and Mitchell spar in the Sodan training
     ring.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The wormhole opens. Mitchell and Volnek stand at
     the base of the ramp.

  VOLNEK
     Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks up the ramp and turns around.

  VOLNEK
     We will meet again.

  ANNOTATION
     He enters the wormhole.

  END EXCERPTS



LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leans against a worktable tapping keys on
     her laptop. She looks very tired. The computer is
     wired to a four-tiered alien device that is also
     on the table. Mitchell approaches from the
     corridor outside and leans against the door frame.

  MITCHELL
     You are still working on that thing!

  CARTER
     (guiltily) Oh, hi.

  MITCHELL
     Did you sleep here last night?

  CARTER
     Of course not. I slept down the hall in my
     quarters.

  MITCHELL
     (in scolding tone) Sam--

  CARTER
     (defensively) This device was recovered from the
     cave under Glastonbury. Who knows what Ancient
     secrets it may hold?

  MITCHELL
     Well, obviously not you, or Doctor Lee who's been
     working on that thing for what, six months? I
     think it's time we let the eggheads at Area 51
     take a crack at it.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter grimaces as Mitchell points out their lack
     of progress.

  CARTER
     Not yet! I--I'm actually making some progress
     here.

  MITCHELL
     That's what you said last night. And I'm hankering
     for hash browns, so let's go grab some breakfast!

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell starts heading out the door. Carter is
     distracted by a reading on her laptop display.

  CARTER
     He-hey! This is interesting! This is the first
     time one of my verification scans kicked back a
     positive result.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell pauses at the door. He fidgets as he
     slowly returns to her.

  MITCHELL
     Does this mean I'm not getting my hash browns?

  CARTER
     It means this device is interactive. I'm reading
     an E.M. output that keeps fluctuating between high
     and low frequencies. I'm going to try to stabilize
     it.

  MITCHELL
     Sure. What have you got to lose?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter types some commands into her keyboard. A
     small blue rectangle at the top center of the
     device glows and gives off a bright white light
     that encompasses Mitchell and Carter. Mitchell and
     Carter wince at the blinding flash. The light
     disappears, and with it, so do Mitchell and
     Carter.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Carter wince and blink, still trying
     to readjust from the blinding flash of light.

  CARTER
     You okay?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, fine. What just happened?

  ANNOTATION
     The center portion of the device gives off a
     softer orange glow now and projects several lines
     of Ancient text into the air in front of Mitchell
     and Carter.

  MITCHELL
     Whoa. Nicely done. Can you read that?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) My Ancient's a little rusty.

  MITCHELL
     Right. We need Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Both turn to leave. Lee enters the lab carrying
     some food on a tray, including a mug of coffee and
     a serving of blue Jell-o.

  CARTER
     Hey, Bill, good timing! Take a look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Mitchell turn back to the display. Lee
     picks up the mug and the Jell-o and turns around
     with a smile. His smile quickly falters, and he
     looks around, confused. Mitchell notices his
     reaction and frowns. Lee stops by a laptop on
     another table. He sets down the coffee mug and
     presses a few keys.

  MITCHELL
     (gesturing) Yo, Doc, amazing discovery over here!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter turns and notices Lee's confused reactions.
     She furrows her eyebrows.

  CARTER
     Bill, you okay?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves towards him. Lee continues towards
     Carter's station while still carrying the blue
     Jell-o. He walks right through Carter and heads to
     her laptop. Carter reacts with shock and feels her
     body after Lee has passed through. Mitchell jumps
     back in shock.

  MITCHELL
     Oh! What the hell!?!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Mitchell remain shocked as Lee glances
     at Carter's laptop and frowns. He puts down the
     dessert and leaves his lab, looking confused.

  MITCHELL
     What was that?

  CARTER
     (worried) I don't know.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell tentatively touches Carter on the
     shoulder. She reciprocates. He pokes her harder.
     She shoves him back. He raises his hand in
     surrender.

  MITCHELL
     Okay, you're solid.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at the device.

  CARTER
     It's the device. By initiating it, we must have
     triggered some sort of localized effect.

  MITCHELL
     "Local" meaning you and me?

  CARTER
     Yeah. Try picking up that coffee cup.

  ANNOTATION
     She points to the mug Lee left behind. Mitchell
     reaches over to pick up the coffee cup, and his
     hand passes right through it.

  CARTER
     (sighing) Oh boy. We need to find Daniel.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Mitchell walk quickly down the hall.
     They consciously avoid the passersby so the
     personnel do not pass through their bodies.

  MITCHELL
     "Out of phase." What does that mean?

  CARTER
     It means we may have shifted to an alternate
     dimension.

  MITCHELL
     (by rote) And there are an infinite number of
     alternate dimensions.

  CARTER
     No, no, no. That's alternate realities.

  MITCHELL
     So when the other SG-1s showed up...

  CARTER
     Completely different problem. See, according to
     M-theory, that unites the five super-string
     theories, there are several spacial dimensions,
     eleven actually, that exist in parallel with our
     physical reality. Now, these higher dimensions--

  MITCHELL
     (interrupting) No, I'll take your word for it.
     That was alternate reality. This is alternate
     dimension. Hell, all I need is a good time-travel
     adventure, and I've scored the SG-1 trifecta. Now,
     how is Jackson supposed to help us with this?

  CARTER
     Well, a similar thing happened to him a few years
     ago.

  MITCHELL
     (after a moment) PX7-377! The crystal skull!

  CARTER
     (surprised) You really did read every report from
     every mission we ever went on, didn't you?

  MITCHELL
     I was in that hospital a long time, and they were
     all riveting.

  CARTER
     (chuckling) Anyway, when Daniel was out of phase,
     nobody could see him except for his grandfather,
     Nicholas Ballard.

  MITCHELL
     (realizing) And because the same thing happened to
     Ballard in Belize, Jackson should be able to see
     us because we're all part of the same club.

  CARTER
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell snaps his fingers.

  MITCHELL
     Perfect.


LOCATION--SGC LOCKER ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c wears a red tank top, workout pants, and
     sneakers. He removes a towel from over his
     shoulder, opens his locker door and throws the
     towel inside. Landry rushes into the room, still
     in his leather jacket and carrying a report.

  LANDRY
     Teal'c, have you see Colonel Mitchell?

  TEAL'C
     I have not.

  LANDRY
     I'm going to need to talk to your team. SG-12 just
     got back from P8T-474, and it looks like we may
     have a timeline for whatever it is the Priors are
     planning. According to the natives, this
     "doomsday" the Priors keep talking about may be
     only days away.

  TEAL'C
     (bowing his head) I will inform the others.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry nods his head in acknowledgment and leaves.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Carter turn a corner and see Daniel
     walking straight towards them.

  MITCHELL
     Jackson! Just the guy to help us with a little
     problem.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel does not look up. He continues walking,
     hands in pockets. He walks straight through
     Mitchell. Mitchell looks very uncomfortable after
     the experience.

  MITCHELL
     Or not.

  CARTER
     (grimacing) The dimension we're occupying must be
     different from the one he was shifted to.

  MITCHELL
     (annoyed) Alternate alternate dimensions?

  CARTER
     (weakly) Something like that, yeah.

  MITCHELL
     Okay. So, what do we do?

  CARTER
     We have to find a way to communicate with them.

  MITCHELL
     (irritated) Any ideas?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter opens her mouth to speak, but the klaxons
     start to blare.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Unscheduled offworld activation!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter signals Mitchell, and both quickly move out
     of the way as Daniel runs past towards the Control
     Room. Mitchell and Carter jog after him.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Mitchell, and Carter join Teal'c, who is
     now wearing his black uniform tank top and fatigue
     pants, and Landry, who is out of his leather
     jacket by now. Harriman and another technician are
     at the controls.

  DANIEL
     What've we got?

  HARRIMAN
     No IDC, sir. But I am receiving a radio signal.

  LANDRY
     Let's hear it.

  ANNOTATION
     A garbled crackling sounds over the intercom.

  LANDRY
     What's wrong with it?

  CARTER
     Sounds like harmonic distortion in the data
     stream.

  HARRIMAN
     I'm not sure, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter rolls her eyes as she realizes no one can
     hear her.

  LANDRY
     Can you clean it up?

  HARRIMAN
     I can try, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A loud thunk is heard against the iris.

  DANIEL
     Okay, that sounded like something hitting the
     iris.

  LANDRY
     Any way to know for sure what it was?

  HARRIMAN
     We can run some tests.

  LANDRY
     Do it. And get Colonel Carter down here to help
     unscramble that message.

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter raises her arms in frustration and sighs.
     She and Mitchell exchange looks as Landry and
     Daniel leave the room.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman and the other technician continue to work
     at their stations. Carter hovers over Harriman's
     shoulder.

  HARRIMAN
     (shaking his head) I can't make heads or tails of
     this.

  CARTER
     That's because the filter coefficient has to be
     adaptive.

  ANNOTATION
     She moves over to the other technician.

  CARTER
     The filter coefficient has to be adaptive!

  TECHNICIAN
     Hey, wait a minute.

  CARTER
     (pleased) There you go. Notice the slight variance
     in the output...Notice it... (a longer pause,
     becoming frustrated) Come on! Notice it!

  TECHNICIAN
     Never mind.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter lets out a disgusted noise and moves
     between them again.


LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c are reporting to Landry.

  LANDRY
     (standing) What do you mean, they're missing?

  TEAL'C
     They are not in their quarters, nor are they
     responding to any attempt to contact them.

  LANDRY
     Is it possible they aren't even on the base?

  DANIEL
     We checked the front gate. Neither of them signed
     out.

  LANDRY
     What about security footage?

  DANIEL
     We're reviewing tapes for both the labs and the
     cafeteria. But beyond that, well, there
     are...hundreds of cameras and hours of tape, so...

  LANDRY
     Then we'll screen them all if we have to. I want
     them found.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Teal'c leave the office. Mitchell, who
     has been there the whole time, remains behind.

  MITCHELL
     Why am I getting that "Patrick Swayze in Ghost"
     feeling?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry starts writing some notes.

  MITCHELL
     General, we need a Whoopi.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry pauses for a moment, then continues to
     write. Mitchell shakes his head in frustration and
     leaves.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry, Daniel, and Teal'c (with Mitchell) join
     Harriman and the technician (and Carter).

  LANDRY
     Walter?

  HARRIMAN
     We managed to clean up the message, sir.

  CARTER
     (snarkily) Finally.

  HARRIMAN
     We noticed a slight variance in the output, so we
     ran it through a sequence of digital filters, and
     we came up with this.

  ANNOTATION
     A garbled message begins to play through the
     speakers.

  SODAN WARRIOR
     (over transmission) Stargate Command...the Sodan.
     Please respond.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c reacts with concern.

  LANDRY
     Did he say "Sodan"?

  SODAN WARRIOR
     (over transmission) ...under attack. Many have
     fallen. We request immediate assistance.

  ANNOTATION
     Staff blasts and cries of pain can be heard before
     the transmission cuts off. They all exchange
     concerned looks.

  HARRIMAN
     And that's when we heard the impact against the
     iris, sir.

  TEAL'C
     General Landry, we should investigate.

  LANDRY
     Agreed. Assemble a team.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c bows in acknowledgment.

  DANIEL
     Sir, Colonel Mitchell's the one who should go.
     He's the one who knows the Sodan the best.

  LANDRY
     I agree, but Colonel Mitchell isn't here right
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Carter exchange resigned expressions.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR BY ELEVATOR, LEVEL 28

  ANNOTATION
     Lee exits the elevator as Daniel walks into it.
     Daniel's head is down, lost in thought.

  LEE
     Oh, hey! Have you seen Colonel Carter?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee stops the doors from closing. Daniel looks up
     in surprise.

  DANIEL
     Hey, I was just coming to ask you the same thing.

  LEE
     Really? Because she left her laptop in my lab.

  DANIEL
     She did?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee enters the elevator.

  LEE
     Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, hooked up to that device
     that you picked up in Glastonbury.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee presses a floor button. As the doors begin to
     close, Daniel dodges them and exits the elevator,
     a strange expression on his face. Lee stops the
     doors from closing and follows him.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Lee stand behind Harriman and the other
     technician as they review security footage of
     Lee's lab. The monitor shows footage of Carter
     leaning on the table by her laptop.

  LEE
     There she is.

  DANIEL
     Fast forward.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman alters the tape and it fast forwards.
     They spot Mitchell approaching and leaning against
     the door frame.

  LEE
     There's Colonel Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     The tape continues to move at faster than its
     normal speed. The group watches as the events that
     occurred just before Mitchell and Carter became
     out of phase play out on the monitor. Just as
     Carter types some commands on the keyboard (when
     the device activated), the screen turns to static.

  DANIEL
     What just happened?

  HARRIMAN
     Looks like the camera went offline. Probably a
     power surge.

  ANNOTATION
     After a few moments, the security picture returns.
     The room is empty. They stare in shock at the
     footage.

  LEE
     They're gone!

  DANIEL
     Okay, bring up the security camera for the
     corridor outside Doctor Lee's lab, sync them up to
     8:16, and run them simultaneously.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman punches some commands into his computer.
     The monitor shows a split screen of the corridor
     and Lee's lab as Mitchell and Carter talk. While
     the lab screen becomes static, the corridor
     footage remains clear. No one enters or exits the
     corridor. The lab footage screen returns with
     Mitchell and Carter gone.

  DANIEL
     Okay, if they didn't go through the doorway, how
     did they get out of the room?


LOCATION--FOREST BY TRANSPORTER, P9G-844 DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The "Eye of the Gods" Ancient transporter
     activates and Teal'c and SG-12 appear, weapons at
     ready. Teal'c holds a weapon in each hand. The
     team spreads out in a defensive pattern.

  HADDEN
     More staff blasts, just like back at the Gate.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. A battle took place here as well.

  HADDEN
     The Sodan have been hiding here for thousands of
     years. The only reason we got their transporter
     codes is because Col. Mitchell won their trust. I
     doubt they would've given them to anyone else.

  TEAL'C
     And yet evidently they were attacked.

  HADDEN
     By who?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c shoots Hadden a serious look before taking
     point. The team follows.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The village is in ruins. Some corpses are
     scattered around. All the homes have been burnt
     out, fires still smoldering. SG-12 and Teal'c look
     around in shock as they approach.

  HADDEN
     My God. Conway, Stevens, get back to the Gate on
     the double. Tell SGC we need med teams.

  CONWAY
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Conway and Stevens move out. Teal'c moves ahead.

  HADDEN
     (to McKensie) Check the area for survivors.

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden, Teal'c, and McKensie enter the village.
     They find more wreckage and several bodies
     scattered across the village. Teal'c checks the
     vitals for one Sodan.

  TEAL'C
     Whomever did this knew well the most efficient way
     to kill Jaffa. Their symbiotes have been targeted.
     They were shown no mercy.

  ANNOTATION
     They spot movement further away. Haikon is wounded
     and groaning. They move to him and kneel beside
     him, checking him over.

  TEAL'C
     Haikon.

  HADDEN
     Pulse is weak.

  TEAL'C
     He will not survive long. His symbiote is dead.

  HADDEN
     Lieutenant, help me get him into one of these
     huts. We need to get some tretonin in him, stat.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR, NEAR COMMISSARY

  ANNOTATION
     An airman walks by with a tray as a kitchen worker
     puts a tray of food into a serving cart. Carter
     and Mitchell loiter nearby. Mitchell points at the
     passing airman's tray.

  MITCHELL
     Roast beef. The one time I can't eat, and they
     serve roast beef. (shouting to kitchen worker) Do
     you know how many times I've requested roast
     beef?!? (to Carter) This is torture.

  CARTER
     It's only been a few hours.

  MITCHELL
     You're not the least bit concerned about this? No
     one can see us or hear us. We can't touch
     anything, ergo no eating, no drinking, and I'm not
     going to speculate on the other bodily functions.
     If they don't figure out a way to get us back...

  CARTER
     They'll figure it out.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Lee has yellow tape and cones surrounding the
     worktable where the alien device and Carter's
     laptop are. He works at his station while Ronald
     manipulates a camera connected to a large pole.
     Landry and Daniel enter.

  LANDRY
     What have you got, Doctor?

  LEE
     Well, we know that Sam was working on the device.
     We know the device does not give off any typical
     energy signatures emitted by Ancient transporter
     technology. This leads us to the conclusion that
     they disappeared without leaving the room.

  LANDRY
     How is that possible?

  LEE
     Miniaturization.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Daniel exchange surprised looks.

  LEE
     Don't panic. I have calculated the distance they
     could possibly travel on tiny legs designated by
     this roped off area. All we have to do is find
     them. Ronald, start with section 1-A.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel bites his lip and drops his head, and
     Landry looks over in disbelief.


LOCATION--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c checks one last Sodan in the square outside
     before heading over to the hut. Haikon lies inside
     the hut, Lt. McKensie treating his injuries.

  TEAL'C
     I was unable to locate any other survivors.
     (softer) What is his condition?

  HADDEN
     We don't know if the tretonin's going to take.
     Even then, his injuries are pretty severe. Without
     a symbiote...

  HAIKON
     (weakly) Volnek.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves to his side.

  TEAL'C
     Haikon. Haikon. Fear not, brother. You are among
     friends.

  HAIKON
     (weakly) Teal'c. Save yourself. You shouldn't be
     here.

  TEAL'C
     Tell me who has done this. Tell me who has caused
     this devastation.

  HAIKON
     Volnek. It was Volnek.

  HADDEN
     (incredulous) One man did this?

  TEAL'C
     Why would he turn on his people? Tell me.
     Haikon...Haikon?

  ANNOTATION
     Haikon loses consciousness.

  CONWAY
     (over radio) Major, come in!

  HADDEN
     (into radio) This is Hadden. Go ahead!

  CONWAY
     (over radio) We're under attack, sir. Requesting
     backup immediately!

  ANNOTATION
     Staff weapon's fire can be heard over the
     transmission. Screams are heard before the
     transmission cuts off.

  HADDEN
     McKensie, you stay with him.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Hadden move out.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The cones and yellow tape are gone. Lee stands in
     front of the alien device, running a radiation
     monitor carefully over every inch of it. Daniel
     enters the lab, stopping short and pointedly
     looking around at the floor before smiling at Lee.

  LEE
     Oh, come on, it was just a theory. Anyway, if I'd
     been right, you'd all be calling be a genius right
     now.

  DANIEL
     (nodding) Yes, but you weren't right. So,
     anything?

  LEE
     (placing earphones over his ears) Ah, eh, nothing
     significant. Fairly, eh, constant power readings
     and, uh, slight traces of lepton radiation.

  DANIEL
     (visibly reacting) What?!?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee turns back to Daniel, unable to hear with the
     earphones on.

  LEE
     What?

  DANIEL
     Lepton radiation? (louder) Lepton...

  ANNOTATION
     Lee takes off the headphones.

  DANIEL
     (voice lowering) Lepton radiation?

  LEE
     Yeah, but like I said, only traces. I mean,
     there's nothing significant there.

  DANIEL
     Gotta go.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel races out of the lab.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Hadden find Conway and Stevens lying on
     the forest ground, wounded.

  HADDEN
     Stevens!

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden checks the vitals for Stevens. Teal'c
     reaches the teleportation device, remaining
     standing and weapons alert as he backs towards the
     device.

  TEAL'C
     This one is alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden races over. He pulls out a syringe from his
     vest and injects Conway.

  CONWAY
     (weakly) I never saw him. The shots came out of
     nowhere.

  TEAL'C
     No doubt Volnek is using a Sodan cloak.

  HADDEN
     We gotta get him back to the Gate now.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c holds both his weapons in one hand and
     punches the controls. Nothing happens.

  HADDEN
     What's wrong?

  TEAL'C
     The code is not working.

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden grabs his weapon. Teal'c pulls open the
     panel. He looks at it briefly before closing it
     again.

  TEAL'C
     Someone has removed one of the control crystals.

  HADDEN
     Then how're we supposed to get out of here?

  TEAL'C
     (worried) We cannot.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel's worktable is covered with open books,
     many very old. Daniel studies three texts
     simultaneously, taking notes. Mitchell fidgets
     nervously nearby.

  MITCHELL
     Come on, Jackson. Figure it out. I've already
     missed breakfast and lunch.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel hears footsteps and looks up.

  DANIEL
     General.

  LANDRY
     Dr. Jackson. I just came from Dr. Lee's lab.
     Please tell me you have better news.

  DANIEL
     I've been going over some of the texts we
     recovered from the cave in Glastonbury.

  LANDRY
     And?

  DANIEL
     Well, a lot of them seem to make oblique
     references to Arthurian legend. For instance, the
     word "anawyn", which shows up several times, is I
     believe a variation on "annwn", the Celtic
     underworld where King Arthur journeyed in search
     of thirteen sacred objects...one of which was a
     cloak.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel hands Landry an illustrated book.

  MITCHELL
     What, the picture of the guy with the big,
     billowing robes?

  DANIEL
     Said to render the wearer invisible. It was called
     the "Mantle of Arthur" and was kept at Bardsey
     Island by none other than our good friend Myrddin,
     whom we know better as...

  LANDRY
     (smiling) Merlin.

  DANIEL
     Exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry hands the book back.

  LANDRY
     I have no idea where you're going with this.

  MITCHELL
     Me either.

  DANIEL
     (speaking more quickly) Well, it wasn't until Dr.
     Lee told me that he detected trace amounts of
     lepton radiation from the device that I was able
     to put it together. You see, the crystal skull
     that transported me to another dimension also
     released lepton radiation.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell bounces with excitement.

  LANDRY
     And you think the same thing happened to Col.
     Carter and Col. Mitchell?

  MITCHELL
     (excited) You're damn right!

  DANIEL
     According to legend, the mantle makes the user
     invisible. Now, given what I've read and what's
     happened today, I'm guessing it wasn't literally a
     cloak at all.

  LANDRY
     It was the device we recovered.

  DANIEL
     It makes sense, sir. Medieval historians could
     well have attributed the powers of the device to a
     cloak simply because they didn't understand it.
     And they could have credited its recovery to
     Arthur, out of deference to their king, who was in
     power at the time. Now given what we know now, it
     seems much more likely that it was Merlin who
     actually built the device.

  LANDRY
     So why would Merlin build a device that could
     transport him to another dimension?

  MITCHELL
     Ooh, today's daily double.

  DANIEL
     Uh, yeah, tha-that's the part I haven't quite
     figured out yet.

  MITCHELL
     (wincing) Close.

  DANIEL
     But at least it points to the possibility that
     both Col. Mitchell and Col. Carter may still be
     somewhere here on this base.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell raises his hands like a referee giving
     the touchdown/goal sign.

  DANIEL
     (continuing) We just can't see or hear them.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Landry look around the room
     uncomfortably, wondering if Mitchell or Carter are
     there. To their view, the area is otherwise empty.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden looks into the hut. Haikon is still
     unconscious. McKensie has Conway hooked up to an
     I.V. and is treating his wounds. Hadden approaches
     Teal'c who is pulling a Sodan cloaking device off
     the arm of a dead warrior.

  HADDEN
     We could make our way back to the Gate on foot.

  TEAL'C
     I do not believe that would be wise. The journey
     would take months, and the terrain is most
     treacherous.

  HADDEN
     There's not much for us, here. We're going to run
     out of supplies before long.

  TEAL'C
     General Landry will send an extraction team when
     we fail to report.

  HADDEN
     And they'll end up stranded here just like us.

  TEAL'C
     We have food for the moment, and we can build
     shelter. Perhaps when the extraction team arrives,
     we can repair the obelisk.

  HADDEN
     What about Volnek? He's still out there.

  TEAL'C
     Leave him to me.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to go. Hadden stops him.

  HADDEN
     Teal'c. He took out an entire village.

  TEAL'C
     It is my understanding that those who use a Sodan
     cloaking device are invisible to everyone but each
     other.

  HADDEN
     So if you use that thing, you'll be able to see
     him.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  HADDEN
     Didn't help that guy much though, did it?

  ANNOTATION
     They both look down at the dead Sodan. Teal'c
     grabs his weapons and leaves. Hadden sighs.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel, Landry and Lee are gathered near Merlin's
     device. Upon closer examination, the tiers are
     made up of several buttons with Ancient symbols
     engraved on them. In this dimension, the device is
     dark, projecting nothing.

  DANIEL
     Now, when I was out of phase, I could both see and
     hear everything that was going on around me. So it
     follows, if they're in the same situation, they're
     hearing what we're saying right now.

  LANDRY
     Except they can't respond.

  DANIEL
     Maybe they can. They just don't know it. Now, what
     does that look like to you? First reaction.

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures to the device.

  LEE
     A keyboard. Uh, except there's no visual
     interface.

  DANIEL
     Not here.

  LEE
     You mean it's on the...other side?

  DANIEL
     Well, it stands to reason that Merlin would want
     the device to be interactive on both sides, this
     and the alternate dimension. Now, the
     interactivity on this side is difficult to access.
     Now, I'm guessing as a type of safeguard against
     just anyone using the device.

  LANDRY
     But there'd be no reason to hide it on the other
     side.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee and Daniel notice one of the keys on the
     device being struck rapidly in succession.

  LEE
     Whoa! Whoa. Did you see that?

  DANIEL
     Oh, yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell stops pressing the key and pumps his fist
     before exchanging a high five with Carter. The
     device in their dimension still projects the
     Ancient text.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah!

  DANIEL
     (loudly) Sam? Uh, Mitchell? If--if you can hear
     me, uh, okay, let's call this button "yes" and
     this button "no".

  ANNOTATION
     Before he's even finished speaking, the "yes"
     button is depressed. Mitchell follows by pressing
     the "no" button.

  DANIEL
     Okay, uh, first question. Um, are you guys okay?

  CARTER
     Yes.

  MITCHELL
     Yep.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell presses the "yes" key.

  LEE
     "Yes." Oh, thank God. I mean, now we're getting
     somewhere.

  DANIEL
     Okay, um, besides the interactivity, is there
     anything else unusual on your end?

  ANNOTATION
     The "yes" button is depressed.

  DANIEL
     "Yes." Something connected to the device?

  MITCHELL
     (gesturing to the projected image) Would you call
     that connected?

  CARTER
     (impatiently) Yes, yes, yes.

  MITCHELL
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell presses the "yes" key. Landry nods in
     satisfaction at these results.

  DANIEL
     "Yes." Is it some sort of display?

  ANNOTATION
     The "yes" key is depressed several times rapidly.

  LEE
     That's, uh, that's an emphatic "yes".

  DANIEL
     Okay, thought so. Um, can you read it?

  ANNOTATION
     There is a slight pause, then the "no" key is
     depressed. Daniel slumps in despair.

  DANIEL
     It's in Ancient, isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     The "yes" key is depressed several times, rapidly.
     Daniel sighs again before moving to the other
     table and grabbing a notepad and book. He pulls
     over a stool and sits.

  DANIEL
     Okay, um, all right. Now, you guys are going to
     have to help me translate what you see, but you
     see, we don't know what pressing buttons randomly
     will do. So, we're going to have to stick with
     "yes" and "no" and just do it. One letter at a
     time.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Carter exchange grim looks before
     sighing.

  LANDRY
     This going to take a while?

  DANIEL
     Oh, yeah.

  LANDRY
     Just keep me posted.

  DANIEL
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry leaves.

  DANIEL
     Okay, um, first letter.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks through the forest. He pauses and
     notes some fresh sap on a young tree. He triggers
     the cloaking device on his arm and vanishes.

  ANNOTATION
     From Teal'c's perspective, the forest takes on a
     more monochromatic hue now that he is using the
     cloak. He raises his weapons and moves forward.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Landry enters the control room. Harriman is at his
     station.

  LANDRY
     Status?

  HARRIMAN
     Still no word from Teal'c or SG-12.

  LANDRY
     How long are they overdue?

  HARRIMAN
     Over an hour.

  LANDRY
     Tell Col. Reynolds to prep an extraction team.
     Have them ready to move out, ASAP.

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell has overheard the conversation and looks
     grim.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Lee has moved over to the other work table. Daniel
     takes notes. Carter stands next to him.

  DANIEL
     Okay, first letter, next word. Stop me when you
     see the right symbol.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel moves his finger across the open pages of
     his book, which is filled with the symbols of the
     Ancient alphabet. Mitchell enters the room.

  MITCHELL
     How's it going?

  CARTER
     (sarcastic) Fantastic. We've almost completed the
     first sentence.

  MITCHELL
     Listen, you think you'll be okay on your own here
     for a while?

  CARTER
     Sure, why?

  MITCHELL
     We've lost contact with Teal'c. Landry's sending
     SG-3 and 22 to check on him at the Sodan village.
     I figured I'd tag along.

  CARTER
     (concerned) Offworld?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, well Jackson was able to travel through the
     Gate when he was out of phase. So, yeah.

  CARTER
     Well, that's my point. You're out of phase. What
     do you hope to accomplish?

  MITCHELL
     (forcefully) Sam, Teal'c could be in trouble. I
     want to check it out. No one can see me. I can't
     get hurt. I can gather intel that no one else can.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel reaches the end of the two pages.

  DANIEL
     Sam, Mitchell, did you see it?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter glances at Daniel before focusing her
     attention on Mitchell. Her jaw is set, and she
     glares at him, clearly unhappy.

  MITCHELL
     Listen, I promise, I'll come back through the Gate
     when they dial to check in. I'll only be gone a
     couple of hours.

  DANIEL
     (louder) Hello? You guys still there?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee gets up, looking around in alarm when he
     realizes Daniel is not getting a response.

  CARTER
     Cameron--

  MITCHELL
     Sam, Teal'c may need help, and I have friends
     among the Sodan. I'll be back soon. Promise.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell leaves.

  DANIEL
     Like, slap a button or something.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter slams down a few keys angrily as she huffs
     in frustration. Lee moves back to his station.

  DANIEL
     (surprised at the vehemence) Okay, thank you. Um,
     okay, first letter, next word, and stop me when
     you see the right symbol.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter directs her attention between the
     projection and Daniel's book.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves through the forest, still cloaked. He
     spots a downed warrior and approaches him,
     checking to see if he still breathes. He hears
     some twigs snapping and stands, alert. Suddenly,
     he is struck in the left shoulder by a staff
     blast. He dives to the ground. Volnek is behind
     him, and fires the staff weapon several times.
     Teal'c takes cover behind a large tree stump.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c suddenly stands and fires both weapons at
     Volnek, striking him several times in the chest.
     Volnek falls to the ground. Teal'c cautiously
     leaves his cover and approaches. After a few
     steps, Volnek opens his eyes and sits up with an
     animalistic snarl. He fires his weapon again, but
     Teal'c dodges, and it hits the tree behind him.
     Volnek's eyes are blood red around their irises,
     where they would normally be white. His teeth are
     corroded and his complexion mottled. He fires his
     weapon several times as Teal'c runs away from the
     blasts.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     The "yes" button on the device is depressed.

  DANIEL
     "Yes." Okay. Next word.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel makes a note on his pad.

  LEE
     That's it! My God, I finally figured out what Col.
     Carter did to trigger the device!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks over at Lee, glancing back at where
     he suspects Carter is before turning back to Lee
     again.

  LEE
     I had to run a reverse scan on all the energy
     fluctuations that we've been recording, put them
     through a program designed to...anyway, I isolated
     the algorithm she used to synchronize the energy
     emissions coming from the device.

  DANIEL
     (totally lost) What?!?

  LEE
     Don't you see? That means if I counteract Sam's
     algorithm from my computer, allow the emissions to
     return to their normal frequencies, that could
     well reverse the process.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sighs and looks skeptical.

  LEE
     Oh, just give me a second. This is brilliant.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee presses a few keys on his computer. Daniel
     sighs and stands, recapping his pen.

  LEE
     That should do it!

  ANNOTATION
     Lee presses the "Enter" key on his keyboard.
     Daniel shies away from the blinding light. Carter
     blinks through the experience and watches with
     interest. Lee continues to study his laptop
     monitor. Daniel turns around and spots Carter.

  DANIEL
     (nonplussed) Sam.

  CARTER
     (grinning widely) Daniel!

  DANIEL
     (ecstatic) Bill, I will never doubt you again.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns back around to look at Lee. Lee turns
     from his laptop grinning, but his face immediately
     falls, dejected. He looks around and sighs.

  LEE
     Oh, boy.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is discomfited by Lee's reaction. Carter's
     smile falters.

  LEE
     Dr. Jackson, can--can you hear me?

  ANNOTATION
     Lee walks through Daniel over to Merlin's device
     and sits on Daniel's stool. Carter winces in
     sympathy as Daniel slumps in resignation.

  LEE
     If you can, press this button for "yes".

  ANNOTATION
     Carter presses the "yes" key. Lee leans on his
     hand and sighs in frustration. Daniel offers
     Carter a false smile as she sighs in despair.


LOCATION--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden guards the entrance to the hut as Teal'c
     approaches.

  HADDEN
     Teal'c, you all right?

  TEAL'C
     It is a light wound.

  HADDEN
     (gesturing to Teal'c) Lieutenant? (to Teal'c) What
     happened?

  TEAL'C
     I found Volnek.

  HAIKON
     Then you're lucky to be alive.

  TEAL'C
     Haikon!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves to Haikon's bedside and they clasp
     forearms in the Jaffa greeting. Teal'c stays by
     Haikon's side as McKensie treats Teal'c's wound.
     Haikon sits up half-way.

  HAIKON
     Others were not so fortunate.

  HADDEN
     He woke up a few minutes ago.

  TEAL'C
     What has happened to Volnek?

  HAIKON
     Ten days ago, he went to a neighboring world to
     acquire supplies for our village.

  FLASHBACK



LOCATION--FIELD, UNKNOWN PLANET, DAY

  HAIKON
     (voiceover) On the way back to the Chappa'ai, he
     encountered a Prior.

  ANNOTATION
     Haikon, holding a staff weapon and rucksack,
     pauses as a Prior wearing dark robes approaches
     him. The Prior holds both an orbed staff and a
     Book of Origin.

  HAIKON
     (voiceover) He was told that the Sodan had
     committed unforgivable treason against the Ori.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior speaks to Volnek, then forcefully shoves
     his staff into the ground. The light from the orb
     flares. Volnek collapses to his knees, clearly in
     pain.

  HAIKON
     (voiceover) The Prior vowed that great ill would
     befall us, and then planted his staff into the
     ground.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

  HAIKON
     (voiceover) Volnek returned to the village and
     told me of the encounter.

  ANNOTATION
     Sodan go about their daily activities. Volnek and
     another warrior spar in the training ring.

  HAIKON
     (voiceover) We took the threat seriously, keeping
     a watchful eye on the Chappa'ai. Several days
     passed without incident until...Volnek fell ill.

  ANNOTATION
     Volnek gets the better of the other warrior, but
     then collapses to his knees, breathing heavily and
     drooling.

  HAIKON
     (voiceover) He became irrational, incoherent. We
     isolated him and treated him with our best
     medicines. But his condition worsened.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Some Sodan look inside a hut. One is a girl pulled
     away by her mother.


LOCATION--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

  ANNOTATION
     Inside the hut, one warrior wipes at Volnek's brow
     while another holds down his feet. Volnek's arms
     are tied to the cot. He froths at the mouth, and
     his eyes are wild, like he has contracted rabies.
     He snarls with deep animalistic growls.


LOCATION--HUT, SODAN VILLAGE

  HAIKON
     (breathing laboriously) Yesterday, he broke the
     bonds that were meant to restrain him. Our finest
     warriors attempted to subdue him, but he killed
     them all with very little effort. He then turned
     on everyone in sight. His own brother, Jolan, was
     killed in the carnage that followed. Women and
     children fled to the woods, and Volnek followed
     them and slaughtered them all without mercy. To
     the best of my knowledge, I am the only one to
     have survived.

  ANNOTATION
     Haikon tries to sit up better, but is too weak.
     Teal' pushes him to lie back down. McKensie
     continues to bandage Teal'c's arm. Hadden has
     listened to the story with concern.

  TEAL'C
     Rest, brother, rest.

  ANNOTATION
     Haikon falls back to the cot.

  REYNOLDS
     (from outside) SG-22, establish defensive
     perimeter.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Hadden are startled.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844 DAY

  ANNOTATION
     SG-3, SG-22, and Mitchell enter the village,
     looking around warily.

  REYNOLDS
     (continuing) SG-3, stick close to me.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-3 raises their weapons at movement by a hut.
     Teal'c and Hadden exit, their own weapons raised.
     Both sides lower their guns as they recognize
     their comrades.

  TEAL'C
     Colonel Reynolds.

  REYNOLDS
     Teal'c, what the hell happened here? Why haven't
     you checked in?

  TEAL'C
     The Eye of the Gods had been damaged.

  HADDEN
     We're trapped here. So are you.

  TEAL'C
     The Ori had a hand in what has transpired here.

  REYNOLDS
     The Ori?

  TEAL'C
     We have much to discuss. Come.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell looks grave and slowly follows the others
     into the hut.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  LEE
     Okay, if you're still there, I've given it some
     thought and my guess is, it should be a simple
     matter of reversing the process. I'm on it.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee moves back to his own computer.

  DANIEL
     Is that supposed to be reassuring? (he looks at
     Lee, then looks around) Where's Mitchell?

  CARTER
     He went offworld with the extraction team.

  DANIEL
     What?!?

  CARTER
     He was convinced he could help Teal'c. I couldn't
     talk him out of it.

  DANIEL
     (snarkily) Why doesn't that surprise me?

  CARTER
     There's no sense in worrying about that now. On
     the bright side, the translation will go a lot
     quicker now that you're here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter gives Daniel a bright, false grin. He
     returns it with a false smile of his own and a
     resigned shrug. Daniel then moves to the
     projection and studies it.

  DANIEL
     Okay, this is interesting. It appears to be a log
     of some kind. Merlin was conducting research on
     some kind of new invention.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel raises his finger to one of the symbols,
     and the display changes. He touches it again to
     read more text.

  DANIEL
     And it was something big. (he changes the display
     again) He went to great lengths to try and hide
     it. This device was invented for the sole purpose
     of keeping his research a secret. He needed a way
     to conceal it from...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel continues to change the display. His voice
     trails off, and he studies the text intently.

  CARTER
     Daniel? Merlin needed to conceal his research
     from...?

  DANIEL
     His fellow ascended beings.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stares at Daniel in shock. He glances at
     her before continuing to read different displays.

  CARTER
     But if he was ascended, he must have retaken human
     form to perform his research. I--I don't get it.
     What research could have been so important that it
     would have led him to give up his ascension?

  DANIEL
     A weapon. A weapon capable of destroying ascended
     beings.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter stares at the display in surprise and takes
     a deep breath.


LOCATION--SODAN VILLAGE, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Hadden and Teal'c stand by a cart. Reynolds
     approaches. Other SG team members patrol the
     perimeter.

  REYNOLDS
     You hit him with two P-90s, and he didn't die. How
     is that possible?

  TEAL'C
     We have encountered something like this before. An
     Ancient device capable of reanimating dead tissue.
     Anubis used a similar technology to give life to
     his Kull Warriors.

  HADDEN
     I'm assuming there's no cure.

  TEAL'C
     The Volnek we knew is dead.

  REYNOLDS
     So how do we stop him...it...whatever?

  TEAL'C
     By destroying the body entirely.

  HADDEN
     Claymores.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell has been standing by Teal'c's side,
     listening to the whole conversation.

  MITCHELL
     Ooh, that's what I'm talking about!

  HADDEN
     We just plant two of them opposite each other, and
     run a trip wire right through the middle. Then all
     we gotta do is lure him in.

  REYNOLDS
     (sarcastically) Piece of cake. While we're at it,
     maybe we can teach him how to speak Japanese.

  TEAL'C
     I will do it.

  MITCHELL
     What?

  REYNOLDS
     Teal'c, the kill zone is going to be huge. You're
     going to have to be awful quick to get out of it.

  TEAL'C
     Understood.

  MITCHELL
     No, no. Now, that's just crazy.

  HADDEN
     Let's at least wait for reinforcements.

  TEAL'C
     Waiting will only put the lives of others at risk.
     Volnek was clever enough to disable the Eye of the
     Gods. Undoubtedly the missing crystal is in his
     possession. The only way we can return to Earth is
     to retrieve it. And the only way that we can do
     that is by killing Volnek. There is no other way.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c grabs his weapons and leaves. Mitchell
     spins around in a circle and follows him, clearly
     annoyed.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Lee moves over to study the device before heading
     back to his computer. Carter watches him as Daniel
     stays focused on the Ancient display.

  DANIEL
     Merlin believed that the Ori represented a
     significant threat to the safety of this galaxy,
     including the Ancients themselves, who refused to
     take any action to protect themselves against
     them.

  CARTER
     So he went ahead and developed the weapon anyway?

  DANIEL
     Well, he found a way of doing it without their
     knowing about it by shifting his research to
     another dimension.

  CARTER
     So, the weapon. Did--did he ever complete it?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel changes the display.

  DANIEL
     Uh, see, this is all technical--way over my head.
     I wish you understood Ancient. These notes seem to
     indicate he completed the weapon here on Earth and
     then had to relocate it to...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pauses and presses a symbol on the display.
     It changes to a new display with seven Stargate
     glyphs appearing amongst the Ancient text.

  CARTER
     (brightening) I don't need to know Ancient to
     understand what that is.

  DANIEL
     A Gate address to where he hid the weapon.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     An airman hides a claymore under some foliage,
     checking the trip wire. Another airman does the
     same on the opposite side of the wire with another
     claymore. He rises and nods to Reynolds.

  REYNOLDS
     Claymores are ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Mitchell stand nearby.

  TEAL'C
     You and your men establish a perimeter. I will
     lead Volnek into the trap.

  REYNOLDS
     You sure you want to do this?

  TEAL'C
     I am.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks away, Mitchell following. Reynolds
     watches Teal'c go with concern.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  LEE
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     He glances over to where his friends must be, then
     huffs when he realizes he can't see them anyway.
     Daniel continues to read different displays as
     Carter glances skeptically over to Lee.

  LEE
     Um, I'm going to try to make an adjustment to the
     algorithm. It's a bit of a long shot, but if I can
     get this to sync up, hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee presses the "Enter" key on his laptop. A
     clunking noise is heard and the projection display
     Daniel has been reading starts to shift
     erratically.

  DANIEL AND CARTER
     Uh-oh.

  LEE
     (half a second later) Uh-oh.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Carter spin around and look at Lee.

  LEE
     (panicking) Oh, no.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee fumbles for a minute with his keyboard before
     picking up the phone and dialing an extension,
     clearly nervous.

  LEE
     (into phone) Um, hello. This is Doctor Lee. I, um,
     I'd like to speak with General Landry, please.
     Yeah, it's a bit of an emergency.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Daniel slump in resignation.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c cautiously moves through the forest,
     weapons at ready. Mitchell strolls behind him.

  MITCHELL
     You know, there's a fine line between crazy-brave
     and crazy-crazy, my friend, and you are walking
     it. You realize he took out an entire Sodan
     village?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c pauses behind a tree and activates the
     cloaking device. Teal'c's perspective shifts to
     the monochromatic vision of the cloak. He starts
     moving purposefully forward, Mitchell sullenly
     following.

  MITCHELL
     You know, the last thing I need is for you to get
     yourself killed. Do you realize how long it'll
     take me to find a replacement?

  TEAL'C
     (calmly) You worry far too much, Colonel Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is startled. He moves directly in front
     of Teal'c.

  MITCHELL
     Wha--? You can hear me now?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c glances directly at Mitchell before moving
     past him.

  TEAL'C
     (stoic) And see you.

  MITCHELL
     (following, still shocked) You're not surprised?


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Landry enters the lab.

  LANDRY
     (worried) What is it? What's going on?

  LEE
     I'm not sure, but I may have, accidentally,
     drained a significant portion of the machine's
     power supply.

  LANDRY
     How significant?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel and Carter listen with concern.

  LEE
     According to these readings, it--it could reach
     critical failure inside fifteen minutes.

  LANDRY
     And what happens to Carter, Mitchell, and Daniel?

  CARTER
     (to Daniel) In all likelihood, we'll be
     permanently stranded.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A cloaked Teal'c and out of phase Mitchell walk
     through the forest.

  MITCHELL
     So, we can see each other when you're cloaked.
     That means, if Volnek's cloaked, he'll be able to
     see me. All I've got to do is get his attention
     and lead him right back to Reynolds.

  TEAL'C
     I do not feel comfortable allowing you to shoulder
     all the risk.

  MITCHELL
     No risk. I'm out of phase, remember?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c pauses and looks at Mitchell.

  TEAL'C
     And you are certain you will not be injured?

  MITCHELL
     Absolutely. Hey, take your best shot if you
     don't--

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell is interrupted by Teal'c slamming his
     arm, still holding the P-90, through Mitchell's
     head. It passes through harmlessly, though would
     have seriously injured Mitchell if it was able to
     make contact.

  TEAL'C
     (bowing) Good luck, Colonel Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c moves off to take cover.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, did you even think twice about that?

  TEAL'C
     (calling back) I did not.

  MITCHELL
     Huh.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell moves off into the other direction,
     jogging through the forest. Mitchell sees the
     forest in the vibrant colors of this dimension.

  MITCHELL
     Volnek! Hey, Volnek!

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell looks around, but sees nothing.

  MITCHELL
     Volnek! Where are you, homeboy? Come on out and
     show me some of those monster moves!

  ANNOTATION
     The cloaked Volnek, moves from behind a tree,
     growling slightly. The forest and Mitchell appear
     in his monochromatic vision.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, there you are. I was getting worried.

  ANNOTATION
     The zombie Volnek aims his staff weapon and fires
     at Mitchell. The blast passes right through
     Mitchell's chest and strikes the tree behind him.
     Mitchell clutches his chest for a moment, then
     smiles and shrugs. Volnek tilts his head,
     confused.

  MITCHELL
     Sorry, you gotta do better than that.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell runs off. Volnek follows.

  MITCHELL
     (still running) Come on, big fella!

  ANNOTATION
     Volnek pauses and fires his weapon again. It
     misses Mitchell every time. Mitchell continues to
     run through the forest, passing through trees on
     occasion. He arrives at the stump where the
     claymore is hidden and pauses in front of it.
     Teal'c watches from behind a tree and hides
     himself further. Volnek appears and Mitchell
     beckons him in a taunting manner.

  MITCHELL
     (in Southern accent) There you go. Come on, and
     get you some.

  ANNOTATION
     Volnek growls and fires his staff weapon several
     times. They all pass through Mitchell and strike
     the stump behind him. Teal'c observes this
     worriedly. Mitchell grins as Volnek growls in
     frustration.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Lee study Lee's monitor. Daniel reads
     the Ancient display.

  CARTER
     We're running out of time.

  DANIEL
     Okay, I think I've got it. This looks like some
     sort of master control screen. Yeah, here it is.
     It's a--it's a button combination.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel's fingers hover over the keyboard, about to
     depress the keys before he curls them back
     hesitantly.

  DANIEL
     If this works, what happens to Mitchell?

  CARTER
     I don't know. I mean, it's possible there's still
     a subspace connection linking him to the device.

  DANIEL
     And if there isn't?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter furrows her brow and looks away. Daniel
     sighs.

  LANDRY
     (to Lee) Doctor!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel shakes his head and starts pressing the
     keys.

  LEE
     Okay, I'm going to try to make an adjustment to
     the algorithm. It's a bit of a long shot--

  LANDRY
     (ominous) You better be sure about this, Doctor,
     because if you make me disappear, there won't be a
     dimension safe enough for you.

  ANNOTATION
     Lee gulps and nods. Both Lee and Daniel press
     buttons on their respective keypads. Daniel and
     Lee both press the final key at the same time.
     Landry sees a blinding white light near the
     device, and Carter and Daniel appear, wincing from
     the flash. They turn towards Lee and Landry with
     equally nervous and hopeful expressions.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell pats his legs as if calling a dog to him.

  MITCHELL
     Come on, don't give up. Come on! Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     Volnek starts to move forward. Mitchell turns to
     run past the trip wire, but pauses, wincing as a
     bright light surrounds him. He stumbles and grabs
     onto the tree stump for support. Teal'c watches
     with concern.

  ANNOTATION
     The forest appears the vibrant color of this
     dimension as Mitchell regains his footing. He
     looks at his hand. It clutches a piece of bark
     that he broke off, and Mitchell realizes he's now
     back in the proper dimension.

  MITCHELL
     Oh, crap.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell spins around, but he is no longer able to
     see the cloaked Volnek.


LOCATION--BILL LEE'S LAB

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Lee smile in relief at seeing Daniel
     and Carter. Landry slaps Lee on the shoulder and
     moves towards the pair. Lee chuckles and turns to
     his laptop.

  LANDRY
     You did it!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter pokes Daniel hard. Daniel shoves her back.

  LEE
     (studying computer monitor, puzzled) No, actually
     I didn't.

  CARTER
     It was Daniel. He figured it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel shrugs and gives a self-deprecating smile.

  LANDRY
     (looking around) Where's Colonel Mitchell?

  DANIEL AND CARTER
     Oh.


LOCATION--FOREST, P9G-844, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell turns to run, but is blocked by an
     invisible force knocking him to the ground. Before
     he can rise, Volnek lifts him by the throat.
     Mitchell reaches out and gauges where Volnek's
     head should be, then punches out with his fist,
     connecting several times. Teal'c starts to move
     forward. Volnek tosses Mitchell aside. Mitchell
     lands in a crumpled heap by the stump. Volnek aims
     his staff weapon, but Teal'c shoves the weapon
     aside.

  ANNOTATION
     Volnek and Teal'c trade blows. Teal'c knocks
     Volnek back and fires several times with his
     P-90s. Volnek is rocked back, stunned. Teal'c
     drops his weapons and deactivates the cloak. He
     helps Mitchell up. They both run, carefully
     avoiding the trip wire. Volnek recovers from the
     gunshots and starts to run after them. He triggers
     the trip wire and the claymores explode. Mitchell
     and Teal'c are knocked flat to the ground from the
     concussion of the explosion. They slowly get up,
     stunned and sore.

  MITCHELL
     (breathing heavy) You know, the whole point of my
     coming here was for me to rescue you.

  TEAL'C
     (smiling) You are most welcome, Colonel Mitchell.

  ANNOTATION
     They both stand and look back at the smoke.

  MITCHELL
     Now, let's see him get up from that one.

  TEAL'C
     Mmm. Unfortunately, we must now locate the
     crystal.

  MITCHELL
     What, you talking about this crystal?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell holds up the crystal. Teal'c smiles and
     nods in satisfaction.

  MITCHELL
     I took it off him during the fight. You know, if
     we hurry, we'll make it in time for dinner.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Teal'c walk back through the forest.
