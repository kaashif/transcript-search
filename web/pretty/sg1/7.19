<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: An industrial estate. Armed guards patrol the roof of a warehouse. Helicopters can be heard overhead. Agent Barrett walks out of the door of the warehouse. NID agents swarm all over. There are several ambulances parked, receiving dead bodies. Agent Barrett walks past them, and up to a 4x4 vehicle. SG-1, minus O'Neill, get out to meet Agent Barrett. They are dressed in civilian clothes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>BARRETT: Major Carter, Dr. Jackson, Teal'c, glad you could make it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They begin walking toward the warehouse.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>BARRETT: An abandoned industrial complex. Near as we can tell it was the home to a rogue N.I.D sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year now.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>CARTER: Still haven't got them all?</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>BARRETT: No, not by a long shot, Major, their ties run deep. They seem to have infinite resources at their disposal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>BARRETT: (sighs) We're not exactly sure yet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel is looking around at the stretchers going back and forth to the ambulances.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>DANIEL: What happened?</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>BARRETT: At approximately 0800 hours this morning, we intercepted a 911 call and moved in just after local authorities arrived. We've been in lockdown mode ever since.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>DANIEL: Wait a minute, someone from a top secret, not to mention illegal operation, called 911?</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>BARRETT: It got ugly. Come on.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He shows them inside.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>BARRETT: We got a call from a panicked male voice, we think it was from the cleaning staff. The call was cut short. Thus far we've counted 32 casualties, which includes a 6 man security contingent.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They enter the main area of the warehouse. NID agents are taking photos of some of the victim's faces before they are zipped up and stretchered away. At least 5 body bags remain on the floor next to SG-1.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>CARTER: (looking around at the slaughter) Who would do this?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>TEAL'C: And for what reason?</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>BARRETT: Actually we know who did it, just not why.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>DANIEL: You know who did this?</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>BARRETT: Yeah.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--WARHOUSE CORRIDOR</td></tr>
<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Barrett leads SG-1 down a darkened corridor. Agents are photographing various artifacts along the edges of the corridor. They come to an armed guard and a heavy door.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>BARRETT: Open it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The agent complies. The door is rolled back to reveal an empty room, apart from a glass box, lit by floodlights from above. Inside the box stands a young woman, dressed in a simple cloth dress, with longish red hair. She has a bed, a chair and a bookcase in the box, and it is littered with charcoal drawings. She looks at them, fear and worry in her eyes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>BARRETT: It was her.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel glances briefly at Barrett, in seeming disbelief.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--WAREHOUSE OFFICE</td></tr>
<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Row upon row of video tapes, simply labelled Anna and a date, sit on shelves in a dark office somewhere in the warehouse. Also in the office are CCTV monitors, and office equipment such as a desk, and a computer. Barrett is sat at one of the monitors, showing SG-1 video footage.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>BARRETT: At first we thought she was a survivor, and then we found this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He presses play. A man is on the screen. It appears that he has already been shot in the leg, and he is crawling away from an unseen foe. Although there is no sound, it is clear he has been shot again in the back from the blood seen splattering out from the impact. Carter flinches. The back of Anna's head appears in the shot. She looks back at the camera, with a calm, even look in her eye.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>BARRETT: We found her cowering in the corner, she seemed to be genuinely terrified. Had no memory of what happened.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>CARTER: You put her in the cell?</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>BARRETT: Yeah, she said that's where they kept her. We locked her up there after we found the security tapes. We didn't want to take any chances.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>DANIEL: Who is she?</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>BARRETT: We're not sure yet. She's been printed. I'm just running her through the system.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>CARTER: Any other survivors?</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>BARRETT: Yeah, one. A scientist names Keffler. We're holding him upstairs. So far he hasn't been very talkative. Come on, let me show you why I've called you guys down here.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--WAREHOUSE BASEMENT</td></tr>
<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Barrett open a door to the basement of the warehouse. It is a room full of ancient Egyptian artifacts and treasures. SG-1 start to look around.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>DANIEL: Wow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>BARRETT: Recognise anything?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>DANIEL: (walking among the shelves) Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Both Teal'c and Daniel pick up artifacts and begin to study them closer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>TEAL'C: This indicates it belongs to Sekhmet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>BARRETT: Who was that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>TEAL'C: A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>DANIEL: From what we know, she was a powerful ally of his. He would routinely dispatch her to rule planets in his stead, quell rebellions, oversee mass executions. You know, all the fun stuff.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>BARRETT: Sounds like a real sweetheart. What happened to her?</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>TEAL'C: It is believed she was exiled for plotting against Ra.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>DANIEL: We also believe that she lived her for most of his dynasty. I didn't realise this stuff had been recovered.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>BARRETT: From what I can gather, it may have come from the Germans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>DANIEL: The Germans?</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>BARRETT: The background I have on Keffler says that he's the son of a convicted Nazi war criminal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>DANIEL: I guess we really shouldn't be that surprised.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>CARTER: Rogue NID really have no limits, do they?</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>BARRETT: See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Daniel nods.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>BARRETT: (To Carter) I'm going to go back at Keffler again. Do you wanna join me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>CARTER: Sure.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They walk away, back towards the door.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>BARRETT: Just thought you might want to watch a master of interrogation at work.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>CARTER: (laughs) You calling in someone special?</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: She pats him on the back.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--WARHOUSE HOLDING ROOM</td></tr>
<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Keffler sits at a table. He is smoking a cigarette, and looks vaguely bemused by what is happening. As Barrett speaks, he raises an eye to him, but stays lounging in his chair.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>BARRETT: Dr. Keffler, this is Major Samantha Carter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>KEFFLER: (finishing his puff on his cigarette, and in a slow, languid voice) Of the Stargate program.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>BARRETT: That's right. (pause) Are you ready to tell us about the girl?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Keffler raises his hands as a gesture of non-commitment, like a shrug of the shoulders.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>BARRETT: Look, Doctor, do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>KEFFLER: Oh, please do, it amuses me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>BARRETT: This was an off the books NID operation. Which means you technically don't exist. Which means no phone calls, no lawyers. Hell I don't have to even read you your rights. To make matters worse for you, the people behind this operation are all in jail. (pause) Nobody to bail you out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Again, Keffler raises his hand, not really bothered.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>CARTER: What kind of work was being done here Doctor?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>KEFFLER: You're a smart girl. (smirking) You'll figure it out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>BARRETT: (raising his voice as he speaks) Look, do you really think that we're going to let you walk away from this? 32 people are dead.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>KEFFLER: Believe it or not I do feel bad about that. Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others. Unfortunately the bad ones always ruin it for everyone, don't they?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Barrett returns Keffler's smirk. He takes a small handheld device, rather like a remote control, from his pocket and shows it to Keffler.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>BARRETT: What's this?</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>KEFFLER: That unlocks my car.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Barrett leans on the table, drawing closer to Keffler.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>BARRETT: Don't think you're safe.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>KEFFLER: (leaning in towards Barrett) Read the papers, Agent Barrett. No one is safe these days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Barrett stands up.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>KEFFLER: My pills?</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He puts his hand out. Barrett takes a bottle out of his pocket, removes one pill, then drops it on the table, next to Keffler's hand. Keffler smiles.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>KEFFLER: Now, now. You wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He slowly puts his pill in his mouth, watching Barrett the whole time. Barrett looks at him, then turns, giving that guard the pill box and walking out the room with Carter.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>BARRETT: It's nitro, says he has a bad heart. I say an x-ray would confirm a total absence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>CARTER: I don't know. I think he's starting to crack.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>BARRETT: Come on, the guy was colder than Hannibal Lecter in there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Barrett and Carter retrieve their firearms from the file cabinet as well as some electric torches.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>CARTER: I didn't want to step on your toes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>BARRETT: Come on, I've got one more thing to show you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>CARTER: There's more?</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--WAREHOUSE BASEMENT</td></tr>
<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Another part of the warehouse. Carter and Barrett descend a flight of stairs by torchlight. 2 agents come past, with a body bag on a stretcher.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They enter a lab. Several work benches are covered in test tubes, microscopes and Petri dishes and computers. Various scientific and medical equipment, such as centrifuges and refrigerators are along the wall to the left, stainless steel refrigerators to the right. Barrett opens one of these cabinets to reveal several large glass canisters. Inside the canisters are dead foetuses, preserved in some kind of liquid. They are in various stages of development.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>CARTER: They look like partially developed foetuses.</td></tr>

<tr id="L112"><td><a href="#L112">112</a></td><td>BARRETT: No, forget it. Major, we, we've already tried that. All the codes are encrypted. I've requested a data retrieval team.</td></tr>
