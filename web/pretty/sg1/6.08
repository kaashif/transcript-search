The Other Guys
TEASER

LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     A large pyramid is in the background. In the
     foreground is a lake with a Stargate at the
     water's edge. A couple of death gliders fly
     overhead.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--THRONE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa enters, carrying a staff weapon. The
     corridor is lined with armed Jaffa. The Jaffa
     kneels.

  HER'AK
     Lord Khonsu.

  ANNOTATION
     Khonsu is sitting on a throne, behind which hang a
     number of weapons.

  KHONSU
     I have a task for you, Her'ak

  HER'AK
     How may I serve you, my Lord?

  KHONSU
     This mission is of great importance so there's not
     much time. If you succeed, Anubis himself will be
     most pleased.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak smiles and Khonsu rises from the throne.

  KHONSU
     I have learned the location of certain enemies.
     They are currently vulnerable. You will take my
     Ha'tak, capture them and bring them to me...alive.

  HER'AK
     My Lord, may I ask who is so valuable?

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak rises as Khonsu walks towards him.

  KHONSU
     Three humans and a Jaffa, known to the Tau'ri as
     SG-1.


LOCATION--ALIEN PLANET--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP

  ANNOTATION
     The landscape is of ruins and sand. Two men
     dressed in desert camo are working among the
     ruins. One is sitting at some equipment which is
     standing on a partially uncovered ring
     transporter.

  COOMBS
     I calculate platform mass at 12.9 metric tons,
     consistent with the one on P4X-233.

  MEYERS
     And every other ring transporter we've measured.
     Suggests some sort of standardization, don't you
     think?

  COOMBS
     You think the Goa'uld have a big plant somewhere
     that just stamps these things out?

  MEYERS
     Jay, how's it coming with the energy levels left
     in that power cell?

  ANNOTATION
     There is no reply from Jay, who cannot be seen.

  MEYERS
     Jay?

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers walks up to Jay, followed by Coombs. Jay
     (Felger) is staring into the distance.

  MEYERS
     The power cell?

  FELGER
     Hmm?

  MEYERS
     The power cell?

  FELGER
     Yeah, yeah I'm working on it.

  MEYERS
     No...

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers snaps his fingers in front of Felger's
     eyes.

  MEYERS
     ...you're not.

  FELGER
     Look at them. They are so cool.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger takes a few paces towards O'Neill and
     Teal'c who are standing some twenty feet away.

  COOMBS
     Jay, enough already. It's embarrassing.

  MEYERS
     Not to mention unprofessional.

  FELGER
     Guys, we're in the presence of greatness here. The
     best of the best, and here we are working
     alongside them. Savour the moment, gentlemen,
     savour the moment.

  MEYERS
     Come on, Felger. We're studying an old piece of
     Goa'uld technology and they're babysitting us.

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers walks away. Felger, still staring at
     O'Neill and Teal'c and grinning, ignores him.

  FELGER
     What do you think they're talking about, right
     now?

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs shrugs in despair and also walks away.

  O'NEILL
     So T, who you taking in the Cup?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at O'Neill, puzzled.

  O'NEILL
     Lord Stanley's Cup?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c raises his left eyebrow.

  O'NEILL
     Hockey? Remember, with the ice and skating?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c raises both eyebrows slightly.

  O'NEILL
     We went to a game last year.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. I believe the Canucks of Vancouver are
     superior warriors.

  O'NEILL
     Canucks, eh?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pauses for a moment, seemingly surprised.

  O'NEILL
     So, lunch?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill moves away towards the three scientists.
     Teal'c follows. Felger is still watching O'Neill
     and Teal'c.

  FELGER
     Here they come.

  ANNOTATION
     He quickly heads over to Coombs who is standing,
     holding a laptop computer. Felger stands on one
     side of Coombs, with Meyers on the other side.
     Felger looks at the monitor, appears to check that
     O'Neill and Teal'c are approaching, and gestures.

  FELGER
     Yes, yes, that does look like a very important
     breakthrough. Good work, Coombs.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger pats Coombs on the back, while Meyers walks
     away.

  FELGER
     Carry on.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c walk past Coombs and Felger.

  O'NEILL
     Progress, professor?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger rushes to walk alongside O'Neill.

  FELGER
     Definitely, yes. Big stuff going on here...big. I
     can give you a full report if you want.

  O'NEILL
     Save it for Carter. We just came here for the fine
     cuisine.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Felger and Teal'c have arrived at a table
     holding a large container. O'Neill opens the
     container and looks at the stack of MREs. He and
     Teal'c start removing them and read the labels.

  FELGER
     Of course, yeah. I mean her...her DHD reports are
     unbelievable aren't they? I mean, she is single
     handedly revolutionizing our knowledge of Stargate
     technology.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks at both Teal'c and O'Neill, who seem to
     be ignoring him as they look over the MREs.

  FELGER
     Any word on how that's going?

  O'NEILL
     No.

  FELGER
     No, no.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill passes a pouch over to Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     Turkey?

  FELGER
     Turkey there.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods and smiles as he accepts the pouch.

  FELGER
     I guess I'll just get back to work, then.

  TEAL'C
     Are you nearing the completion of your research?

  ANNOTATION
     A crash is heard.

  COOMBS
     Ow! Jeez. Who put that scanner there?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c raises an eyebrow.

  FELGER
     Uh...well, it may be a few more days yet.

  O'NEILL
     What's your time frame there?

  FELGER
     Um, a day or so, you know, but then you guys can
     get right back to saving the world again...

  ANNOTATION
     Felger quickly thumps O'Neill on the arm a couple
     of times. O'Neill looks at his arm then looks at
     Felger. Felger laughs.

  FELGER
     For the seventh time.

  TEAL'C
     Eighth.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and O'Neill look at Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     What, you're counting?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c raises an eyebrow and shrugs slightly.

  CARTER
     (over radio) Colonel O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     (into radio) Yeah, Carter. Go.


LOCATION--P5X-112--STARGATE DHD

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate is shutting down as Jonas walks
     towards Carter.

  CARTER
     We just received an urgent message from General
     Hammond.


LOCATION--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP

  ANNOTATION
     Felger is standing very close to O'Neill and
     listening over his shoulder. O'Neill almost does a
     double-take.

  O'NEILL
     Roger that. We're on our way.

  ANNOTATION
     There is another crashing sound.

  COOMBS
     Oh, good one, that's only worth about two hundred
     thousand dollars.

  O'NEILL
     Felger?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pronounces Felger's name incorrectly, as
     he does throughout the mission.

  FELGER
     Yes?

  O'NEILL
     We've got to check something out.

  FELGER
     Can I help?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Felger and Teal'c walk away from the
     table. Teal'c grabs his staff weapon on the way.

  O'NEILL
     No. As a matter of fact, stay here. If we're not
     back in an hour, get to the gate, dial home. Got
     it?

  FELGER
     Well, what could go wrong?

  O'NEILL
     Got it?

  FELGER
     Yes, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill and Teal'c walk away, Felger stares
     after them.


LOCATION--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP

  ANNOTATION
     Some time later, Felger comes running down the
     slope into the camp. He approaches Coombs and
     Meyers who are kneeling over equipment.

  FELGER
     Aren't you guys the slightest bit worried about
     them?

  COOMBS
     They'll be back, Felger. Can't you see, they're
     just having fun with you.

  FELGER
     What are you talking about? There's something
     going on out there.

  COOMBS
     Oh, please, huh? They're just tired of your
     butt-snorkeling.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs rises to face Felger.

  COOMBS
     (mockingly) So tell me how you finally defeated
     Apophis, Colonel O'Neill. Oh, Major Carter, I
     based my doctoral thesis on your amazing wormhole
     stability theories.

  FELGER
     Bite me, Coombs! At least my heroes exist. If this
     was a Trek convention you'd be all dressed up like
     a Klingon.

  COOMBS
     Vulcan, Felger, Vulcan.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs and Felger face off against each other.

  COOMBS
     And I don't know how you can call yourself a
     scientist and not worship at the alter of
     Roddenberry.

  FELGER
     (mockingly) Oooh, how we gonna get outta this one
     Captain? Oh, I don't know, something to do with a
     tachyon emitter.

  MEYERS
     Guys, knock it off. Now, what say we hook up the
     Naquadah generator and see if we can't get this
     baby started.

  FELGER
     Fine.

  COOMBS
     Good.

  FELGER
     (under his breath to Coombs) Nerd.

  COOMBS
     (to Felger) Geek.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly, a ship flies overhead, casting a large
     shadow over the area. Coombs buries his head in
     his arms and Felger ducks, but quickly looks up to
     watch the ship, which has headed over the hill.
     All three stand.

  MEYERS
     Was that what I think it was?

  FELGER
     An Alkesh. Mid range Goa'uld attack vessel.

  COOMBS
     But this planet was supposedly abandoned centuries
     ago. There isn't even anything here except...

  FELGER


  SG-1.


  ANNOTATION
     Felger runs to grab a radio off a box.

  FELGER
     (into radio) Colonel O'Neill, Felger. We just saw
     an Alkesh.


LOCATION--P5X-112--RUINS NEAR STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Carter are sheltering behind some
     ruins. As O'Neill fires his weapon, a zat is
     discharged.

  O'NEILL
     (into radio) I know! Stay put! Remember what I
     told you. Wait till it's clear, get to the gate,
     report to Hammond.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is behind another wall, firing a zat.


LOCATION--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP

  ANNOTATION
     The three scientists can hear gunfire in the
     distance.

  FELGER
     (into radio) Colonel O'Neill? Major Carter?


LOCATION--P5X-112--RUINS NEAR STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     The Alkesh is hovering over the Stargate.
     Transporter rings ascend into the ship. Zats are
     being fired, as well as O'Neill's P-90 and
     Teal'c's staff weapon. The Alkesh fires multiple
     rounds behind SG-1, creating a wall of fire.


LOCATION--P5X-112--SCIENTIFIC CAMP

  ANNOTATION
     The noise of the battle can be clearly heard.

  FELGER
     Oh, they're in trouble.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger runs off in the direction of the gunfire.

  COOMBS
     Hey! Where you going Felger? He told us to stay
     put.

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers and Coombs reluctantly run after Felger.

  FELGER
     (into radio) Colonel O'Neill? Major Carter?


LOCATION--P5X-112--NEAR STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     Felger comes to an overhang and scrambles down to
     lie on his stomach.

  FELGER
     Oh, no. Oh...

  MEYERS
     This is ridiculous, Felger. You're gonna get us...

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers and Coombs run up to him. Felger turns to
     grab Meyers' leg to pull him to the ground.

  FELGER
     Shut up.

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers, in turn, grabs Coombs' arm to pull him
     down.

  FELGER
     Look.

  COOMBS
     Oh, my God.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger gestures ahead, where SG-1 are being led by
     the Jaffa towards the Alkesh.


LOCATION--P5X-112

  ANNOTATION
     The three scientist are running back to the ruins
     and the science camp.

  COOMBS
     Wait, wait, wait, wait. You mean do something?
     What do you mean, do something? You're totally out
     of your mind, Felger. Mission protocol clearly
     states that if something goes wrong, we are to
     return to Stargate Command immediately and you
     know what? Something went wrong.

  MEYERS
     Colonel O'Neill said it himself. We have to go
     back to Earth.

  FELGER
     I know what he said, but I'm the senior advisor on
     this mission and I'm making a command decision.

  MEYERS
     You're a lecturer in residence at M.I.T.

  FELGER
     Laugh all you want, but I studied every mission
     SG-1's ever been on, and the one thing they all
     have in common? They never leave a man behind.
     Ever.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger grabs the naquadah generator.

  COOMBS
     Technically, they're not behind. We are.

  FELGER
     Meyers, you go back through the gate, tell General
     Hammond what's happened.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger turns to walk away.

  COOMBS
     What about us?

  FELGER
     We're going after SG-1.

  COOMBS
     No, really.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger kneels and places the generator by the ring
     transporter.

  FELGER
     You know, that ship must have taken them back to
     the mother ship out in orbit. We can use this
     platform to ring up to it but we have to act now
     before they're out of range.

  COOMBS
     No, really.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger opens a small panel on the transporter.

  FELGER
     What? You want their death on your heads?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger gets up, followed by Coombs and heads over
     to a number of cases.

  COOMBS
     You're just adding our deaths to theirs.

  FELGER
     (To Meyers) Would you go?

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers grimaces at Felger then turns to leave.
     Felger, carrying a couple of cases, and Coombs
     return to the transporter.

  FELGER
     Help me calibrate this.

  COOMBS
     Jay, we haven't run any tests, we have no idea how
     stable any link will be, assuming we can even get
     one.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger has removed a crystal from the open panel
     and places a probe in its place. A number of other
     crystals light up.

  FELGER
     We're not out of range.

  COOMBS
     Jay? Are you sure about this?

  FELGER
     Think about it, Simon. What would Colonel O'Neill
     do if he was here now?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger hands a pistol to Coombs.

  COOMBS
     You want me to shoot you?

  FELGER
     Let's go.

  COOMBS
     All right.

  ANNOTATION
     As Felger and Coombs step into the rings, they
     activate.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The rings beam up to the mothership.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP

  ANNOTATION
     As soon as the rings deposit Felger and Coombs and
     deactivate, Felger covers his eyes, starts
     shooting and turns in a circle. Coombs ducks and
     falls to the ground as the shooting starts. As
     Felger stops shooting, Coombs rises, very
     agitated.

  COOMBS
     Nicely done. We were alone, but that'll probably
     change now.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger motions with his hand.

  FELGER
     Please, shh...just...okay. Area secure. Let's move
     out.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs, obviously not happy, follows Felger to a
     doorway. Both jump back as the door automatically
     opens. They walk through into a corridor.


LOCATION--SGC CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Alarms are sounding. Davis is sitting at a
     terminal. Hammond comes up behind him.

  HAMMOND
     What've we got, Sergeant?

  DAVIS
     It's SG-1's code, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond leaves the Control Room.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A number of armed SFs are aiming at the Stargate.
     Hammond enters just as Meyers comes through the
     gate.

  MEYERS
     (out of breath) SG-1...they...took...SG-1.

  ANNOTATION
     Meyers virtually collapses into Hammond's arms at
     the bottom of the ramp.

  HAMMOND
     Slow down, son. Take it easy. Where's the rest of
     your team?

  MEYERS
     (out of breath) Ship, lots of Jaffa, SG-1
     captured, flew away, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond gestures for the SFs to lower their
     weapons.

  HAMMOND
     Where are professors Felger and Coombs?

  MEYERS
     They used the rings at the ruins to go up to the
     ship, to rescue

  SG-1.


  HAMMOND
     They did what?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs and Felger are crawling through a small
     shaft.

  COOMBS
     Damn it, Felger. This cannot be the way.

  FELGER
     I swear...

  ANNOTATION
     Felger stops and tries to open a panel but is
     unable to.

  FELGER
     ...it's up here and to the left.

  COOMBS
     That's what you said three lefts ago.

  FELGER
     Head!

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs hits his head on the shaft roof. Felger
     laughs.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CELL

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and O'Neill are sitting on a bench, with
     Jonas and Carter sitting across the room from
     them.

  CARTER
     (to Jonas) How come you're not smiling?

  JONAS
     Should I be?

  CARTER
     Well, it is your first time being capture by a
     Goa'uld.

  ANNOTATION
     Both Carter and Jonas smile.

  JONAS
     Funny.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas sighs and lies his head back against the
     wall.

  JONAS
     So what now?

  TEAL'C
     We wait.

  JONAS
     Shouldn't we be trying to escape?

  O'NEILL
     Oddly, no. It won't be long.

  JONAS
     Before what?

  O'NEILL
     Oh, some overdressed, over the top bad guy floats
     in gloating about whatever evil fate awaits us.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas nods, eyebrows raised. O'Neill pauses,
     listening.

  O'NEILL
     Wait for it.

  ANNOTATION
     Both outer and inner doors to the cell open.
     Her'ak enters, followed by a number of Jaffa.

  O'NEILL
     See?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c stand.

  HER'AK
     Colonel O'Neill. Major Carter. The so-called
     greatest of all Tau'ri warriors. And the Shol'va,
     Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns to grasp Teal'c's shoulder and pat
     him on the back. Her'ak turns to Jonas.

  HER'AK
     You, I'm not familiar with.

  O'NEILL
     He's new.

  CARTER
     Who are you?

  HER'AK
     I am Her'ak, First Prime to Lord Khonsu of Amon
     Shek.

  O'NEILL
     Very impressive. Got a resum?

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak smirks.

  HER'AK
     I captured you.

  O'NEILL
     Yes. Right. You did. Well done. You've got the
     job.

  HER'AK
     I had been looking forward to a greater challenge
     than the one you provided. However, the result has
     yielded the same consequence. You belong to my
     master now.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak and the Jaffa leave.

  O'NEILL
     Carter, be honest. The resum gag...?

  TEAL'C
     It needs work, O'Neill.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The mothership is heading for a wormhole.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     A wall panel falls to the floor.

  FELGER
     Shhh.

  COOMBS
     I didn't do anything.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs and Felger climb out of the vent. Felger,
     holding his weapon, crouches and scuttles over to
     the other side of the corridor.

  COOMBS
     You have no idea where you're going.

  FELGER
     Of course I do.

  COOMBS
     Oh yeah, then what were we doing in the vent?

  FELGER
     Staying out of sight. Would you stop worrying?
     I've studied blueprints of these motherships.
     Holding cells are this way.

  COOMBS
     Oh please, you've studied Goa'uld mothership
     blueprints?

  FELGER
     Information's an SG team's greatest ally.

  ANNOTATION
     As Felger crouches and scampers along the
     corridor, Coombs walks along.

  COOMBS
     You know what an SG team's greatest ally is? An SG
     team!

  FELGER
     Will you relax? Okay, it's this way.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger heads off, followed by Coombs. Some seconds
     later they return and move off down another
     corridor.

  FELGER
     No, this way.

  COOMBS
     I'm gonna kill you.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger again scampers down the corridor, weapon
     held up with both hands next to his face.

  COOMBS
     Would you quit doing that?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger turns around to face Coombs.

  FELGER
     This?

  COOMBS
     Don't point the gun!

  ANNOTATION
     Both men head off around a corner.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CELL

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas and Carter are looking up at a large vent,
     obviously hearing whistling which is coming via
     the vent.

  JONAS
     Is that a bird?

  TEAL'C
     I do not believe so.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and O'Neill stand. O'Neill goes over to the
     vent.

  FELGER
     (quietly, through the vent) These panels are held
     in place magnetically. We have to cut the power.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leans closer to the panel.

  O'NEILL
     Who is that?

  FELGER
     Colonel O'Neill?

  O'NEILL
     Felger?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger removes the panel.

  FELGER
     Oh, Colonel O'Neill. Are you all right, sir?

  O'NEILL
     (frustrated) What are you doing here?

  FELGER
     Stand easy, we're here to rescue you.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger grins.

  CARTER
     Did he say we?

  FELGER
     That's right. I have Coombs with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs appears in the vent.

  COOMBS
     Hi.

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) Why, look everybody, he's got
     Coombs with him.

  FELGER
     You can thank us later. Right now we have to get
     you out.

  O'NEILL
     (angrily) Felger! Just what part of gate home did
     you not understand?

  FELGER
     Well, we just couldn't let our fellow SG team
     members be taken...

  O'NEILL
     Felger!

  FELGER
     What about never leave a man behind?

  O'NEILL
     What about we allowed ourselves to be captured.
     (furious) On purpose.

  COOMBS
     Oh.

  FELGER
     You what?

  O'NEILL
     We're on a mission, you nit!

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Coombs look at each other sheepishly.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c are glaring at Felger and
     Coombs, who are now out of the vent.

  FELGER
     Please don't be angry, we just thought...

  ANNOTATION
     Felger grins nervously as Coombs points at him.

  COOMBS
     It was Felger all the way. His idea completely.

  FELGER
     Okay, well, I don't understand. I mean, what do
     you mean you're on a mission?

  CARTER
     The Goa'uld we're being taken to see is actually
     an undercover Tok'ra.

  FELGER
     Oh, yeah Oh.

  COOMBS
     I see. Uh, well, why the ruse?

  TEAL'C
     Very few of Khonsu's Jaffa know his true identity.
     Her'ak and his men had to believe they had truly
     captured us.

  FELGER
     See, I knew it was too easy. I mean, you guys have
     taken out more Jaffa than that before, right?

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     Professor, we know you meant well but you've
     actually put us in a really awkward position.

  FELGER
     Well, why not tell us?

  O'NEILL
     Because you didn't need to know.

  CARTER
     We've been on standby for weeks, waiting to hear
     from the Tok'ra. Now, we didn't know where or when
     this ambush would occur. Obviously, you weren't
     supposed to be there when it went down, but when
     we finally did get the word it was too late to
     send you home first.

  FELGER
     Why didn't this Khonsu just, you know, send the
     intel to you? I mean, why the big song and dance?

  JONAS
     He's collected vital information on how and where
     Anubis is getting his new technology.

  TEAL'C
     As we have said, Khonsu's true loyalties are
     carefully hidden. He could trust no one to carry
     such information in his place.

  CARTER
     He needs to remain undercover to continue his
     work.

  O'NEILL
     So did we.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs thumps Felger on the arm.

  COOMBS
     Way to go, Felger.

  FELGER
     Wait a minute, we got up here undetected. We
     haven't ruined anything yet. Nobody knows we're
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c turns to the door, obviously hearing
     footsteps,

  TEAL'C
     Someone approaches.

  ANNOTATION
     A Jaffa and guard enter. O'Neill stands
     nonchalantly by a wall.

  DOL'OK
     I am Dol'ok, free Jaffa, loyal to Khonsu the
     Tok'ra.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Teal'c and Jonas are standing shoulder to
     shoulder. They all nod at Dol'ok. The guard checks
     that no-one is approaching.

  DOL'OK
     Thank you for your patience.

  O'NEILL
     What patience? Can we get our weapons back? Not
     that we don't trust you.

  DOL'OK
     Soon. As you are aware, this incarceration is for
     your own protection. There are very few of us
     among the ranks but we have come to assure you
     that you are indeed not alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Dol'ok notices two pairs of feet behind Carter,
     Teal'c and Jonas. Felger and Coombs show
     themselves either side of Teal'c.

  DOL'OK
     Who are they?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Coombs duck down.

  O'NEILL
     Look, there's been a little bit of a mix up here.
     Any chance you could put these guys someplace
     safe, relatively secure, till this is over?

  DOL'OK
     I will do what I can.

  O'NEILL
     Appreciate that.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pats Dol'ok's shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     (to Felger and Coombs) Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures for them to step out. Felger
     pauses and gives O'Neill an apologetic look. Both
     men follow Dol'ok and the cell doors close behind
     them.

  O'NEILL
     Oy.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET

  ANNOTATION
     A large pyramid is in the background. In the
     foreground is a lake with a Stargate at the
     water's edge. A number of death gliders fly
     overhead.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak appears on a large screen. A couple of
     guards are in the room. Khonsu steps closer to the
     screen.

  HER'AK
     As ordered, we have SG-1 alive and uninjured.

  KHONSU
     Excellent. You have done well, Her'ak. I will be
     sure to tell Lord Anubis of your exemplary conduct
     when I relay this victory to him.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  HER'AK
     My thanks. Shall I interrogate the prisoners on
     your behalf, my lord? Surely there is much that
     they can reveal?

  ANNOTATION
     Khonsu appears on a large screen.

  KHONSU
     No. When you arrive, bring them before me. I will
     use my own methods to learn what they know.

  HER'AK
     As you wish, my lord.

  ANNOTATION
     As the image of Khonsu fades, Her'ak turns away
     and sneers.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CARGO BAY

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Coombs are sitting behind storage
     crates, as another crate is moved into position to
     hide them.

  DOL'OK
     Please do not venture from this place until we
     have returned. Should you be discovered your lives
     would be forfeit.

  COOMBS
     You got it.

  FELGER
     You try to help people, this is the thanks you
     get.

  COOMBS
     I should have shot you.

  ANNOTATION
     Another crate is moved into position to completely
     hide them.

     The mothership is orbiting a planet. A transporter
     beam is being fed from the ship to the pyramid on

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak leads SG-1 through the pyramid, flanked by
     guards.

  O'NEILL
     So, when do we get to meet this old Ginsu guy?

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak opens a large doorway and SG-1 step
     through.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CELL

  O'NEILL
     Nice.

  ANNOTATION
     The room is circular, with a central platform
     edged with hip-high walls with three entrances.
     Her'ak gestures for the team to step onto the
     platform. Once SG-1 are on the platform, a force
     field flows upwards from the walls. Her'ak turns
     to leave. O'Neill reaches out to touch the force
     field, which obviously hurts.

  O'NEILL
     Ah! (to Carter and Teal'c) Don't touch that. (to
     Her'ak) Hey, Her'ak!

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak stops in the doorway and turns back to face
     SG-1.

  O'NEILL
     What, no gloating? Take some pride in your work,
     son.

  HER'AK
     You shall all be forced to bow before my master
     soon enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak and the guards leave the room. Jonas shakes
     his head as the door closes. O'Neill sighs and
     shrugs.

  O'NEILL
     You know, this whole imprisoned for our own
     protection is getting a little old.

  CARTER
     What choice did we have? If we want this
     information, we have to trust Khonsu.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shrugs in agreement.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CARGO BAY

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Coombs are sitting behind the crates.
     Felger has his head in his hands.

  COOMBS
     I knew I should have updated my will before
     agreeing to off-world assignments.

  FELGER
     You are not going to die, Coombs.

  COOMBS
     Oh, come on, Felger. We might as well be wearing
     red shirts.

  FELGER
     I don't get that?

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs is about to speak as the bay door opens.
     Dol'ok and another Jaffa enter. Felger and Coombs
     look from behind the crates. A staff blast from
     the corridor hits the Jaffa in the back. Dol'ok
     goes for his weapon but is also shot. Three Jaffa
     enter and the first one kicks Dol'ok.

  JAFFA
     Shol'va!

  ANNOTATION
     The lead Jaffa looks towards the crates hiding
     Felger and Coombs but then all three Jaffa leave
     and the door closes behind them. Felger pushes
     aside the crates to look at Dol'ok and the dead
     Jaffa.

  COOMBS
     Oh, my God. I think I'm gonna throw up.

  FELGER
     Oh, these poor bastards.

  COOMBS
     Jay, I can't do this. I've gotta get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs moves from behind the crates, heading for
     the door.

  FELGER
     Simon, Simon, Simon, Simon.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger grabs Coombs.

  COOMBS
     No! I'm not a soldier. I teach applied math at
     Yale! I have a vespa and two cats.

  FELGER
     (quietly) Just get a hold of yourself! Don't you
     get it Simon? Jaffa do not kill each other for
     fun.

  COOMBS
     They don't?

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs gestures at Dol'ok.

  FELGER
     Okay. I don't know that for sure. I don't. But
     this looks like an execution. Something hinky's
     definitely going on here and it's up to you and I
     to find out what it is.

  COOMBS
     Hinky?

  FELGER
     Yeah, it's a word.

  COOMBS
     In what dictionary?

  FELGER
     I have a plan.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger grins.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE

  ANNOTATION
     A number of Jaffa are guarding the area. A
     transporter ring activates, unloading Felger and
     Coombs dressed as Jaffa. They move away, passing
     many of the other Jaffa. Both look uncomfortable.
     As they reach an area with no Jaffa in sight,
     Coombs puts on his glasses.

  COOMBS
     Is it okay for me to have a heart attack now? God,
     I don't know why I let you talk me into this.

  ANNOTATION
     They are walking though a wooded area.

  FELGER
     Because if we stayed on that ship we'd both be
     dead right now and you know it.

  COOMBS
     Oh yeah, and we're better off down here?

  FELGER
     When are you going to start trusting me, Simon? I
     have four post graduate degrees.

  COOMBS
     And not one of them cover Jaffa military tactics.

  ANNOTATION
     As they step up a slight incline, a Jaffa appears
     behind them.

  JAFFA
     What are you doing here?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Coombs turn slowly to face the Jaffa.

  COOMBS
     Uh.

  FELGER
     (put-on deeper voice) He is sick. I believe it is
     something he ate.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs nods then vomits. Felger zats the Jaffa.

  FELGER
     Nicely done, nicely done.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger pats a shocked Coombs on the arm.

  COOMBS
     Jay, you just shot that guy. I mean you really
     shot him.

  FELGER
     No, zatted, that's completely different.

  COOMBS
     Zatted...shot...

  FELGER
     Come on, gotta go, gotta go.

LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--THRONE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Khonsu is seated on the throne, with a number of
     Jaffa guards lining the room. Her'ak enters with
     several other Jaffa.

  KHONSU
     Her'ak.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak stands before the throne. Felger and
     Coombs--no longer wearing his glasses--enter the
     room and stand at the back, behind a number of
     Jaffa.

  KHONSU
     Where are the prisoners?

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak does not reply. Khonsu stands.

  KHONSU
     Answer me. Where is SG-1?

  HER'AK
     They are no longer your concern.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak activates his staff weapon and shoots
     Khonsu, who collapses to the ground. Felger and
     Coombs look around in shock, as do the other
     Jaffa, who activate their weapons towards Her'ak.
     Her'ak steps up to the platform and faces the
     Jaffa.

  HER'AK
     We are betrayed, brothers. Our God was not who he
     claimed to be.

  ANNOTATION
     Khonsu turns over onto his back.

  HER'AK
     Khonsu is Tok'ra.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa deactivate their staff weapons.

  HER'AK
     He would weaken us like a cancer from within,
     destroying our one true God. Anubis.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak again fires on Khonsu.

  HER'AK
     I am in command now, until our lord returns to
     reward us and claim his prize. Spread the word
     among every rank. Be ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak sits on Khonsu's throne.

  HER'AK
     Anubis is coming.

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are led into the room. O'Neill looks around.

  O'NEILL
     Where's Khonsu?

  HER'AK
     Khonsu is dead.

  O'NEILL
     Dead? Completely dead or semi-dead? You guys seem
     to have a grey area in that regard.

  HER'AK
     His true loyalties were well known. Once his
     betrayal bore fruit, his existence was no longer
     required.

  O'NEILL
     You calling us fruit?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill elbows the Jaffa standing behind him in
     the face. Teal'c grabs another Jaffa and his staff
     weapon. Another Jaffa, on the platform with
     Her'ak, zats both O'Neill and Teal'c, who fall to
     the floor. Carter and Jonas struggle but are held
     by Jaffa. Felger and Coombs, armed with staff
     weapons, stand at the rear. Her'ak smirks nastily,
     and picks up a pain-stick. O'Neill turns over on
     to his back, while Teal'c is held up by a couple
     of Jaffa. Her'ak steps up to O'Neill and uses the
     pain-stick on him. O'Neill yells in pain.

  O'NEILL
     Ah! Crap! I hate that thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak smirks.

  HER'AK
     Now that, Colonel O'Neill, is what I call pride in
     my work.

  O'NEILL
     Good job!

  HER'AK
     I want names, Colonel, of all the Tok'ra hiding
     within Anubis' ranks.

  O'NEILL
     Oh, ask Khonsu. Oh wait, you can't, you killed
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     Her'ak again uses the pain-stick on O'Neill, as
     Jonas struggles to get free.

  HER'AK
     Tell me!

  O'NEILL
     We don't know anything.

  CARTER
     He's not lying. Our orders were to make contact
     with Khonsu. That's it. Any information you want
     died with him.

  O'NEILL
     Forget it, Carter. He's just the warm up band and
     he knows it.

  HER'AK
     No matter what you have endured, you have never
     experienced the likes of what Anubis is capable
     of.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stares up at Her'ak, who has returned to
     the platform.

  O'NEILL
     You ended that sentence with a preposition.
     Bastard!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Jonas and Teal'c are led from the room, as
     O'Neill is dragged to his feet and taken out.
     Felger and Coombs watch them leave, looking
     worried.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Davis is seated at a terminal, with Hammond
     sitting next to him.

  HAMMOND
     That was his last transmission?

  DAVIS
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond rises as Meyers enters.

  MEYERS
     Excuse me, sir. Anything on SG-1?

  HAMMOND
     As a matter of fact, we just got a message from
     one of our Jaffa allies. Apparently, word has
     filtered through Anubis' ranks that Khonsu was
     exposed as a Tok'ra and that he's been murdered.

  MEYERS
     Oh, no.

  HAMMOND
     SG-1 is still in the custody of the Jaffa who've
     overthrown Khonsu and Anubis himself is on the
     way. There's been no mention of Felger and Coombs.

  MEYERS
     Is there no chance of mounting some sort of
     rescue? I'd be happy to volunteer.

  HAMMOND
     I appreciate that, but the planet's very heavily
     guarded. That was one of the reasons SG-1 had to
     go in undercover.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond turns to walk away.

  MEYERS
     Sir, with all due respect, I thought you didn't
     leave people behind?

  HAMMOND
     I don't like this any more than you do, but I'm
     not going to send good men to their deaths for
     nothing, especially considering the sketchy nature
     of the intel we have on the situation. There's
     just nothing we can do at this time. I'm afraid,
     if SG-1 is going to get out of this mess, they're
     going to have to do it on their own.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger crouches around a corner and grabs Coombs
     who walks out, almost uncaring.

  FELGER
     Don't do that.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger creeps through the room from pillar to
     pillar, followed by Coombs, who is speaking
     loudly.

  COOMBS
     All right. So maybe you did study Goa'uld
     mothership plans, but how can you possibly know
     where we're going now?

  FELGER
     (whispering) I don't.

  COOMBS
     Jay, this is bad.

  FELGER
     I know!

  COOMBS
     Look, our best shot is just to get back to SGC,
     tell them what happened, where SG-1 is and...

  FELGER
     Look, even if we could get through the gate,
     there's no telling when Anubis will arrive.
     Chances are SG-1 will be long gone or dead by the
     time they mount a rescue mission, if they're
     willing to send one at all.

  COOMBS
     Well, all right, what about SG-1 then, huh? If
     they're the big heroes you say they are then they
     can just bust themselves out.

  FELGER
     Come on, Coombs! This op is up to us and you know
     it.

  COOMBS
     Op?

  FELGER
     Op, op, op, op! It's operation.

  COOMBS
     Well, just say operation then. Say operation like
     normal people.

  FELGER
     Keep your voice down.

  ANNOTATION
     A door opens and Felger and Coombs enter a large
     circular room.

  FELGER
     We have to learn everything we can about this
     place, find some weakness and exploit it.

  ANNOTATION
     The room appears empty, apart from a large, tall
     pillar.

  COOMBS
     Uh huh. How the heck are we supposed to do that?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger walks up to the pillar and presses a
     button. The pillar slides open to reveal a control
     panel.

  COOMBS
     How'd you know how to do that?

  FELGER
     Well, the writing in the hall said this was the
     control room.

  COOMBS
     It did?

  FELGER
     I thought you said you read Goa'uld.

  COOMBS
     I do, sort of.

  ANNOTATION
     Both men sit at a chair at the control panel.

  FELGER
     Well, this should be able to tell us everything we
     need to know.

  ANNOTATION
     They start moving crystals around. A large
     holo-screen appears before them, with writings and
     diagrams flashing past.

     We're hiding in the control room.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures in irritation.

  CARTER
     Colonel, they could have access to the pyramid
     security systems including force shield controls.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  FELGER
     We're working on it.

  CARTER
     (over intercom) You should be able to bring up the
     pyramid schematics. Within the security system
     files you'll find a list of force shield codes.

  ANNOTATION
     A holo-image of the pyramid appears before Felger
     and Coombs.

  COOMBS
     Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here, Major. Okay

  O'NEILL
     (over intercom) Felger, we need weapons.

  COOMBS
     (to Felger) Um, looks like there's an armoury at
     the end of the hall.

     Felger grins and laughs.

  FELGER
     (To Coombs) You get the shield down and use your
     radio from now on.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger leaves and Coombs presses buttons on the
     panel.

  COOMBS
     This is unbelievable. Everything is in here.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CELL

  O'NEILL
     Coombs. What's going on?

  COOMBS
     (over intercom) I've almost got it.

  ANNOTATION
     The force field de-activates.

  O'NEILL
     Nice.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pauses where the force field used to be,
     waves his hand through the area then moves forward
     when he is not shocked by the force field.

  O'NEILL
     Nice.

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill reaches the doorway, he gestures for
     Teal'c to stand opposite him so that they are
     flanking the door. As the door opens, Teal'c moves
     to attack the newcomer but pulls back when he sees
     that it's Felger. Felger drops a number of zats
     which he is carrying. Carter and Teal'c pick up
     the zats, and Felger hands one to Jonas. O'Neill
     grabs Felger's arm.

  O'NEILL
     All right, look professor, this little stunt of
     yours does not excuse the fact that you disobeyed
     a direct order. From me. Twice.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger, looking sheepish, removes the Jaffa skull
     cap.

  O'NEILL
     Do it again I'll shoot you. Are we...?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger responds quickly.

  FELGER
     ...Crystal.

  O'NEILL
     Good.

  FELGER
     Do you wanna hear the rest of my plan?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger grins at O'Neill.

  COOMBS
     (over the intercom) Our plan.

  FELGER
     (via radio) I said stay on the radio.

  O'NEILL
     Just...tell me what you know.

  FELGER
     Okay. There's a shield around the pyramid. The
     Stargate's outside that.

  CARTER
     So Coombs could get the shield down.

  FELGER
     Right. Then all we have to do is take out the
     Jaffa guarding the gate. Coombs can ring himself
     out to the ring platform and then we all go home.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger laughs.

  FELGER
     Piece of cake.

  O'NEILL
     We take out the Jaffa.

  FELGER
     We...as in you.

  O'NEILL
     How many?

  FELGER
     A dozen, tops.

  O'NEILL
     A dozen?

  FELGER
     Yeah, and they got some of those really big guns.

  O'NEILL
     Good plan, Felger, good plan.

  FELGER
     Come on, you're SG-1, this is what you do.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas, Carter and Teal'c look at each other as
     O'Neill ponders.

  O'NEILL
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill leads the others out of the cell.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks down the pillar-lined room, followed
     by the others.

  O'NEILL
     (via radio, quietly) Coombs, talk to me.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs is studying a map on the holo-imager before
     him.

  COOMBS
     (into radio) Okay, hang another left and then two
     rights and then there'll be a door and beyond that
     is daylight.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures for Carter and Felger to go to
     the doorway. Carter enters a code but the door
     remains closed. She turns to O'Neill, shrugging.

  O'NEILL
     Felger?

  FELGER
     (into radio) Coombs?


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs is obviously frustrated. He pulls off his
     skull cap.

  COOMBS
     (into radio) I'm sorry. This coding is very
     confusing. Just wait a second.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs presses some more buttons.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Felger is staring at O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger walks up to O'Neill as Carter enters
     another code on the door panel.

  FELGER
     I can't believe that I'm here...with you...like
     this. It's...

  O'NEILL
     Yeah, I'm having the same problem.

  FELGER
     This is great! You know, sneaking around with you
     guys in a Goa'uld pyramid on some alien planet.
     The only thing missing is some Jaffa chasing us.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal, who has been guarding the doorway into the
     room, enters and stands behind a pillar. Footsteps
     can be heard.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill.

  FELGER
     Okay, that's not my fault because there's no
     possible... (into radio) Simon? Simon, hurry up,
     we've got company.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  COOMBS
     Wait, wait, wait!

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs is urgently reading the holo-image.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill grabs Felger's radio.

  O'NEILL
     Give me that. (into radio) Now! Coombs.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs presses a number of buttons on the panel.

  COOMBS
     I got it!


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and Felger leaves, followed by
     SG-1. A number of Jaffa enter the room but walk
     through, without noticing the open door.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  COOMBS
     (into radio) Shield is down.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET--FOREST

  FELGER
     Way to go, Simon!

  O'NEILL
     (furious) Shush. (into radio) Get your ass to the
     nearest ring transport and wait for my signal.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs switches off the panel and runs over to the
     doorway.

  COOMBS
     Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've been a
     great audience, but I really must be...

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens to reveal a number of Jaffa on the
     other side. Coombs reaches over to the panel to
     close the door.

  JAFFA
     You! Stop!

  COOMBS
     Staying. God.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs runs to hide behind the control panel.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     The area is guarded by a number of Jaffa.

  O'NEILL
     Well, he wasn't kidding, that's a lot of Jaffa.
     Carter, Jonas, your target is that centre gun
     placement.

  CARTER
     Yes, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c, you're with me. (pointedly, to Felger)
     Now, is there anything else we need to discuss?

  FELGER
     No, sir, No, sir. I'm going to stay in this very
     spot. Even if I see you writhing in agony, calling
     my name, I'll be here.

  O'NEILL
     Exactly. On my signal, get Coombs out here.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill hands the radio to Felger, then SG-1 move
     out. Jonas and Carter zat a couple of Jaffa as
     O'Neill zats two more. As another Jaffa walks
     alongside the lake, Teal'c launches out of the
     water, drags the Jaffa under and kills him.

  COOMBS
     (over radio) Jay...uh...I've got a problem here.

  FELGER
     (into radio) Shhh.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A large crack appears in the door as the Jaffa ram
     against it. Coombs is sitting down behind the
     control panel.

  COOMBS
     (into radio) I think I need a little help.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     More of the Jaffa are shot down. As Carter and
     Jonas near the large gun placement, they are fired
     upon. The Jaffa swivels the large weapon around
     towards them. They put up their hands as they see
     this, but before the Jaffa can fire, the weapon
     explodes. Teal'c, standing at another large gun,
     has fired on the Jaffa. He turns the gun towards
     more Jaffa, as O'Neill continues to zat even more.

  O'NEILL
     Clear?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Jonas run towards him.

  CARTER
     Clear, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c runs in from another direction.

  TEAL'C
     The area is secure for the moment, O'Neill.

  FELGER
     (yelling) Colonel O'Neill. Colonel O'Neill!
     Colonel O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     Felger runs towards them.

  O'NEILL
     What are you doing? Get Coombs out here.

  FELGER
     There's a slight problem there, sir. He's stuck.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The crack in the door is now much larger.

  COOMBS
     (into radio) Jay. I don't think I'm gonna make it
     out of here. You just go, you take care of my
     cats, okay?


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA

  FELGER
     (into radio) No, no, no, no, Simon. I got us into
     this mess. If you're staying, I'm staying too.

  O'NEILL
     No one's staying! Can he ring us in?

  FELGER
     (into radio) Coombs, can you ring Colonel O'Neill
     and Teal'c into the pyramid?

  COOMBS
     (over radio) I'll try.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Teal'c stand inside the ring platform.

  O'NEILL
     (to Carter) Give us five minutes and then...

  ANNOTATION
     They are ringed up.


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PYRAMID--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     As the crack in the door widens further, Coombs,
     now hiding behind the chair, hears zats firing
     outside the door. The battering at the door stops.
     Coombs walks closer to the doorway but jumps back
     when the hammering starts again. As the door
     collapses, Coombs, almost in tears, sees O'Neill
     on the other side.

  O'NEILL
     Let's go home.

  COOMBS
     Oh, thank God!


LOCATION--KHONSU'S PLANET--STARGATE AREA

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Coombs and Teal'c are ringed back
     outside. They run to the Stargate, where Carter,
     Jonas and Felger are standing at the top of the
     steps. As they run, they are fired on.

  FELGER
     Simon, are you okay?

  O'NEILL
     Later!

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Carter go through the gate. A number of
     Jaffa run towards the Stargate, firing. As Jonas,
     Coombs and Teal'c enter the gate, O'Neill stops at
     the top, turns to Her'ak who is leading the Jaffa,
     shrugs and smiles. A staff blast hits the Stargate
     and O'Neill jumps back then goes through the gate.


LOCATION--SGC CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATEROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Felger and Coombs enter the festooned gate room
     and step up the red-carpeted ramp to a podium at
     the foot of the Stargate. Carter, O'Neill and
     Hammond are at the podium. A number of personnel
     are also in the gate room.

  HAMMOND
     For bravery in the face of grave danger, I hereby
     award Simon Coombs and Jay Felger, each, the Air
     Force Civilian Award for Valour.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill removes two medals from their boxes and
     turns to face Coombs and Felger. He places the
     medal on Coombs first.

  O'NEILL
     Despite the fact that you gentlemen disobeyed my
     orders, which, in my little world, constitutes
     screwing up...twice. The truth is, we wouldn't be
     here without you. You are true heroes.

  FELGER
     Thank you, Colonel.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill shakes hands with both Felger and Coombs.
     Meyers, in the crowd, puts both thumbs up to them.
     Carter shakes Coombs' hand and kisses him on the
     cheek as the crowd starts to applaud. She shakes
     Felger's hand then holds his face in both hands
     and gives him a long kiss on the mouth.

  COOMBS
     (as the kiss is going on) Felger!


LOCATION--SGC LAB

  COOMBS
     Felger, Jay.

  ANNOTATION
     Coombs pokes Felger in the cheek.

  FELGER
     Ow. What?

  COOMBS
     Snap out of it.

  FELGER
     Yeah, sorry.

  COOMBS
     Calibration scales for the ring power source?

  ANNOTATION
     Felger hands Coombs a clipboard.

  FELGER
     Right there, right...there.

  COOMBS
     Geek.

  FELGER
     Nerd.
