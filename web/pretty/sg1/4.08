The First Ones
TEASER

LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates, and armed soldiers gather
     at the foot of the ramp. The alarm siren sounds in
     the background.

  INTERCOM VOICE
     Unscheduled off world activation.


LOCATION--CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Sgt Davis is at the main console as Hammond,
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter enter the room staring
     at the activating Gate.

  DAVIS
     It's SG-11, sir.

  HAMMOND
     Open the iris.

  DAVIS
     Yes, sir. The iris is opened.

  CARTER
     Daniel's with them isn't he?

  HAMMOND
     They're not due to check in for two more days.

  ANNOTATION
     They exit the control room and head to the Gate
     room.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A very scruffy looking Rothman exits the Gate. He
     is out of breath and has been running. He proceeds
     down the ramp. Hammond and SG-1 enter the room.
     The armed soldiers lower their weapons.

  HAMMOND
     Dr. Rothman, what is it? What happened?

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman is too out of breath to quickly respond.
     He sits down on the edge of the ramp.

  O'NEILL
     Where's the rest of your team?

  ROTHMAN
     Loeder's dead. Some sort of indigenous life form.
     It killed Loeder. The rest of my team went after
     it!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at him alarmed.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel?

  ROTHMAN
     No, no, no. It took Daniel. That's why the others
     went after it.

  CARTER
     How long ago?

  ROTHMAN
     I don't know, maybe three hours! I...Daniel is
     still alive! That thing was dragging him!

  O'NEILL
     You saw it?

  ROTHMAN
     Just for a second...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     Request permission to lead search and rescue, sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond gives a nod.

  ROTHMAN
     But if I had a guess, I'd say it was an Unas!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at him shocked.

  O'NEILL
     A what?

  ROTHMAN
     It was like that...that thing you described in
     your mission report from Cimmeria!

  ANNOTATION
     Still out of breath, Rothman takes a breath from
     his inhaler.

  O'NEILL
     (to Hammond) Basically we're talking about a
     Goa'uld with teeth and claws, sir.

  TEAL'C
     Not necessarily, O'Neill.

  HAMMOND
     What do you mean?

  CARTER
     Daniel believed that 888 was the planet from which
     all Goa'uld symbiotes originated.

  TEAL'C
     It may be that there are Unas there that have
     never been taken as hosts.

  O'NEILL
     We're still talking about a big, stinky monster!
     Makes no difference.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed it does. These Unas will be far more
     primitive and lack the regenerative powers of Unas
     we have previously encountered.

  CARTER
     So what would a primitive Unas want with Daniel?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Hammond.

  O'NEILL
     Recommend units one and two, P-90's. I also
     recommend we take off right now, sir.

  HAMMOND
     You have a go.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c run off to gear up.
     Hammond stares down at Rothman who is still sat on
     the ramp.


LOCATION--P3X-888, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is on the ground, unconscious. He begins to
     wake up and opens his eyes. The Unas growls
     nearby. Daniel looks around and sees that his
     hands are tightly bound in front of him. The rope
     leads from his hands to the Unas, who is standing
     near him. The Unas paces impatiently. He is
     wearing crude clothing and there is a wound on his
     hand from Loeder's gunshots. Daniel raises his
     head off the ground and looks around for means of
     escape. But the Unas senses this and turns sharply
     round. He growls at Daniel and then drags him to
     his feet by the rope.


LOCATION--GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The UAV fires up and flies through the active
     Stargate to search for Daniel. Hammond and Sgt
     Davis are monitoring the events from the control
     room. Carter, Teal'c and members of other SG teams
     are assembled at the foot of the ramp. They are
     all looking at O'Neill, who moves to the top of
     the ramp to address them.

  O'NEILL
     All right, listen up! We're a little pressed for
     time here so this is going to have to serve as
     your mission briefing. Daniel Jackson has been
     dragged off by a creature called an Unas. This is
     a search and rescue. Any questions?

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman enters the Gate room, still pulling his
     coat on.

  ROTHMAN
     Err, yes, I have one. When exactly were you going
     to tell me when we were leaving?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill slowly puts his cap on looking at Rothman.

  O'NEILL
     I wasn't.

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman looks surprised.

  ROTHMAN
     Oh.

  O'NEILL
     (to everyone) Move out!

  ANNOTATION
     The SG teams start to go up the ramp and through
     the Gate pushing past Rothman. He goes through the
     Gate with Teal'c.


LOCATION--P3X-888, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The SG teams span out defensively around the
     Stargate. O'Neill talks about the situation with
     Major Coburn.

  COBURN
     The Stargate is secure, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Make sure it stays that way, sergeant.

  COBURN
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Coburn walks off to his team. O'Neill tries to
     contact SG-11 via the radio.

  O'NEILL
     Sierra golf one-one-niner, this is sierra golf
     one-niner, come in.

  ANNOTATION
     There is no reply.

  O'NEILL
     Sierra golf leader do you read?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter approaches looking at a readout of the UAV.

  CARTER
     Sir, the UAV is switched to automatic and is
     flying a search pattern. Nothing yet.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at his watch as Teal'c approaches.

  TEAL'C
     Daniel Jackson would have contacted us by radio by
     now if he were able.

  CARTER
     What about SG-11?

  O'NEILL
     Well, they could all be out of range.

  TEAL'C
     The Unas would be capable of traversing great
     distances in a short time.

  O'NEILL
     Well, we know they're not here. Teal'c, take
     point. Pierce, you've got our six!

  PIERCE
     Yes, sir!

  O'NEILL
     Rothman, you're with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman looks up from blowing his nose and
     follows. Major Griff pushes him along. They all
     set off on the search.


LOCATION--FOREST OF P3X-888, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas drags Daniel by the rope attached to his
     bound wrists. Daniel is stumbling and is obviously
     exhausted.

  DANIEL
     (out of breath) Ok, I know it seems completely
     unlikely that you understand a word I'm saying but
     err...I've gone about as far as I can go at this
     particular place, so, with your permission, I'm
     going to fall down now!

  ANNOTATION
     He collapses to the ground, exhausted. The Unas
     stops and looks at him angrily.

  DANIEL
     Rest! This is a thing you should err...become
     familiar with! Rest...it means err...rest!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas growls at him angrily, and he rears back
     startled.

  DANIEL
     That's close...try again...GRRRESSST!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas stares at Daniel who reaches into his
     pocket and retrieves his radio.

  DANIEL
     This, this is err...nothing that you need to be
     worried about. This is a radio. It's err...so my
     friends can find me and shoot you!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sits up to use the radio. He stands and the
     creature looks at him as he activates the radio.

  DANIEL
     Err...this is Daniel Jackson. If anyone can hear
     me...

  ANNOTATION
     The creature swipes the radio angrily out of
     Daniel's hand where it crashes against a tree. He
     then jerks Daniel's ropes and knocks him to the
     ground.

  DANIEL
     (out of breath) Ok, I get it, no more radio. Radio
     bad! Do you speak any kind of language at all? I
     mean you must be intelligent. I mean, you made
     that necklace and those clothes.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel gestures to the simple clothing and large
     bone necklace. The creature drags him to his feet
     and starts walking again.

  DANIEL
     (sarcastically) Ah yeah, yep that was refreshing,
     thank you. I'm good for another ten miles!


LOCATION--P3X-888 FURTHER BACK IN FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The search party is walking through the forest.

  CARTER
     Sir!

  O'NEILL
     Yeah!

  CARTER
     Fairly strong RDF signal. It's gone now. Not long
     enough to triangulate.

  ROTHMAN
     So...so what does that mean?

  ROTHMAN
     Daniel might have tried to use his radio.

  GRIFF
     Could be SG-11.

  CARTER
     UAV picked up something. I can't explain why it
     died out.

  O'NEILL
     All right let's pick it up!

  ANNOTATION
     They increase the pace of the search.


LOCATION--P3X-888 FOREST NEAR RIVER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is still being dragged along by the Unas.
     They come to a river and the Unas stops. He looks
     at the sky to see two moons. Daniel takes the
     opportunity for rest and drops to the ground.

  DANIEL
     Yes, rest! This is err...this is good. This is
     rest.

  ANNOTATION
     He lies down and closes his eyes. The Unas
     crouches down and seems to perform a kind of
     chant. Daniel hears this and looks up at him. He
     sits up.

  DANIEL
     Is this some sort of meditation or...?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas ignores him and continues chanting.
     Daniel reaches into his left jacket pocket and
     brings out the recorder he was using at the dig
     site. He activates it and begins recording
     cautiously so as not to alarm or disturb the Unas.

  DANIEL
     This is Doctor Daniel Jackson. In case anybody
     finds this, I've met a wonderful new friend, and
     he's taking me on a long journey to see his
     friends.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas hears him and suddenly stops chanting and
     looks at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     (to Unas) I'm just making notes. (into recorder)
     At the moment, my main concern is that my new
     friend is an aboriginal Unas in its un-Goa'ulded
     state, and that I'm the evening meal.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at the chanting Unas.

  DANIEL
     It err...or rather, he appears to have undeveloped
     chin and facial horns which indicate he could be a
     subspecies. Possibly a juvenile.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas growls at Daniel who stops talking.

  DANIEL
     Shut up?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas snorts.

  DANIEL
     I understood that... (into recorder) We're
     communicating. UNAS</br> A cha'ka. A cha'ka. A
     cha'ka. A cha'ka. A cha'ka.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stares at him as he chants. He aims the
     recorder at the Unas.

  DANIEL
     Schakka...Schakka...Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas stops and stares amazed at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Is that what you call yourself? Chaka? Daniel, I'm
     Daniel. Chaka is something else?

  ANNOTATION
     The creature looks at him and growls slightly.
     Daniel looks at the sky.

  DANIEL
     Is Chaka the moon? This is some sort of moon
     chant?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas looks at Daniel with wide eyes,
     surprised.

  DANIEL
     (gesturing with bound hands) Moons coming into
     alignment?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas becomes angry and growls loudly at
     Daniel. Daniel ducks his head.

  DANIEL
     (to himself) Moon chant, what was I thinking?

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly the sound of the UAV overhead is heard.
     The Unas stands up alarmed

  UNAS
     Shesh!

  DANIEL
     Shesh, what is that?

  UNAS
     Chaka, keka! Shesh! Chaka keka! Shesh!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas points at the UAV as it flies overhead.

  DANIEL


  UAV!


  ANNOTATION
     He makes a symbol for the UAV with his hands and
     points at it.

  DANIEL
     UAV! It's my friends looking for me.

  UNAS
     Shesh! Chaka keka!

  DANIEL
     You're frightened! It's ok, it won't hurt you. It
     won't hurt you.

  ANNOTATION
     The creature calms down, and they both stare at
     each other.


LOCATION--P3X-888 FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The search team is still walking through the
     forest. Teal'c is at the front followed by
     O'Neill, Carter and Rothman. O'Neill speaks into
     his radio.

  O'NEILL
     Sierra golf one-one-niner this is sierra golf one
     niner. Come in? We're somewhere on your six
     joining the search, do you read? (To Carter) Where
     the hell is Hawkins?

  CARTER
     UAV will have run out of fuel by now.

  ROTHMAN
     Maybe an Unas got him.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a drink of water from his flask as Carter
     and O'Neill look back at him.


LOCATION--P3X-888, BANK BY BODY OF WATER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A snake like being swims quickly past in the
     water. The Unas drags Daniel away from the water.
     Daniel pulls back and stops.

  DANIEL
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     He points at the body of water with his bound
     hands.

  DANIEL
     Water...I need water.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas scans round the area then approaches the
     river with Daniel. Daniel kneels down and puts his
     mouth near the water to take a drink. The Unas
     sees him do this and drags him up. Daniel stares
     angrily at the Unas as it shows him to cup the
     water in his hands to drink away from the water
     edge. Daniel shows the Unas his hands tied to the
     rope preventing him from cupping the water. The
     Unas grudgingly puts the rope down on the ground
     to let Daniel drink. Daniel takes some water and
     drinks it and splashes it over his face. He then
     sees that the Unas is not looking and grabs the
     rope and makes a run for it. The Unas follows in
     pursuit.


LOCATION--P3X-888 DIG CAMP, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The search team approaches the camp cautiously and
     fans out to inspect the area for hostiles. O'Neill
     and Carter check inside the tents with their
     weapons drawn whilst the others stand guard.


LOCATION--FURTHER ALONG EMBANKMENT, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel runs from the Unas. He hears it approaching
     and sees it come near. Daniel backs into the water
     to get away from it as the Unas seems to be scared
     of the water. Nearby, one of the snake-like
     creatures watches watches Daniel as he backs into
     it. Daniel swims across the river and approaches
     the opposite bank. But the Unas has circled around
     and is waiting for him. Daniel stops and stares at
     the Unas. Suddenly there is a ripple in the water
     and it is obvious that something in the water is
     approaching Daniel. Daniel makes a decision and
     hurries out of the water The being is Goa'uld
     symbiote, which leaps out of the water at Daniel.
     Just as it reaches a shocked Daniel the Unas grabs
     it, twists it and breaks its head off. He then
     grabs a scared looking Daniel and smears the
     bright blue blood of the Goa'uld over Daniel's
     face.

  UNAS
     Keka, keka, keka!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel backs away slowly.

  DANIEL
     (out of breath) Keka. Keka means dead? Danger?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas growls, looks around, and pulls at
     Daniel's rope as he attempts to edge towards the
     water.

  UNAS
     Ka!

  DANIEL
     Ok, ka means no.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas strikes out and knocks Daniel to the
     ground. Daniel looks up at him.

  DANIEL
     Right, I won't do that again.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas pulls Daniel to his feet, and they set
     off again.


LOCATION--P3X-888 DIG CAMP, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman, O'Neill, Teal'c and the rest of the
     search team approach the spot where Daniel and
     Loeder were attacked.

  ROTHMAN
     (pointing) Loeder was killed over there.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill uses hand signals to get the others to fan
     out and secure the area. Major Griff and another
     soldier approach the edge of the woods where the
     body of Loeder lays.

  TEAL'C
     He appears to have been killed by a being of great
     strength.

  ANNOTATION
     Major Griff checks Loeder's body.

  O'NEILL
     (to Rothman) What was Loeder doing?

  ROTHMAN
     Packing up fossilised Goa'uld for transport back
     to earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Major Griff looks in the soil around Loeder's body
     and picks up some items.

  O'NEILL
     You guys weren't doing anything that would have
     provoked an attack?

  ROTHMAN
     I, err...I don't know!

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) You know, Rothman, I'm so glad you
     came!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks near to Loeder's body.

  ROTHMAN
     Ok, then no, I doubt it very much. You see we'd
     been at the dig for three weeks doing exactly what
     Loeder's been doing for three weeks.

  ANNOTATION
     Major Griff approaches.

  GRIFF
     Look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows them a handful of bullets.

  GRIFF
     They got off a hell of a lot of shots.

  TEAL'C
     Our theory appears to be correct O'Neill. The
     stride, width, and shape of these footprints
     appear to be consistent with that of an Unas.

  O'NEILL
     Can you track it?

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the soldiers who went into the forest
     approaches with a visibly shocked Major Hawkins.

  SOLDIER
     Colonel O'Neill! We found him just standing there,
     staring off into space.

  HAWKINS
     Colonel?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill approaches Hawkins cautiously.

  O'NEILL
     Where's the rest of your men?

  HAWKINS
     We were attacked. Sanchez is dead for sure. I
     don't know what happened after that. We got split
     up...I was hoping some of them might have made it
     back.

  ANNOTATION
     He stares around confused.

  ROTHMAN
     Oh god!

  CARTER
     Major, we've been trying to contact you for the
     last few hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Hawkins looks down for his radio that isn't there.
     They all look at him in sympathy.

  HAWKINS
     (to O'Neill) My men are dead, aren't they?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill puts a hand on his shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     Look, Hawkins. I can't spare anybody to take you
     back to the Stargate. You're going to have to
     stick with us. Can you do that?

  HAWKINS
     (in shock) Whatever you say, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Let's move out!

  ANNOTATION
     They set off again following the trail of the
     Unas.


LOCATION--P3X-888 CAVE ENTRANCE, DUSK

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas is dragging Daniel into a dark cave. It
     picks up a large stick at the entrance.


LOCATION--P3X-888, NEAR EMBANKMENT, DUSK

  ANNOTATION
     The search team is near the river. Teal'c is
     examining one of the Unas footprints there. Carter
     approaches O'Neill and points at Rothman who is
     bending over and out of breath using his inhaler.

  CARTER
     Sir, I think we should rest.

  O'NEILL
     All right, go to ground. Boots on. No fire!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods.

  O'NEILL
     I'll take first watch.

  ANNOTATION
     They all walk into the woods and O'Neill sits down
     by the riverbank. One of the Goa'uld in the river
     is watching him.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     The dead Goa'uld is roasting on a spit above an
     open fire. The Unas lifts the head up, and Daniel
     looks at it in disgust. The Unas puts it back over
     the fire.

  DANIEL
     Is this your cave...your cave?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas just looks at him and growls lowly.

  DANIEL
     It's nice!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas takes the Goa'uld out of the fire and off
     the spit. He throws it towards Daniel who just
     stares down at it. The Unas then takes the other
     end of the Goa'uld for himself. He points at the
     Goa'uld in front of Daniel.

  UNAS
     Nan!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas then takes a bite out of the Goa'uld.

  DANIEL
     Nan.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel picks up the Goa'uld head.

  DANIEL
     Nan is Goa'uld? It's err...a symbiote?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel makes a sound and a signal of the Goa'uld
     flying through the air. The Unas stares at him and
     growls.

  UNAS
     Ka. Nan!

  ANNOTATION
     He takes another bite of the Goa'uld while
     pointedly looking at Daniel.

  DANIEL
     Eat, nan is eat, of course!...No, you know, if I
     am the main course, I'd rather you fill up on the
     appetisers.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws the Goa'uld head on the floor.

  DANIEL
     So no...err ka!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas picks up the Goa'uld head and throws it
     back at Daniel.

  UNAS
     Nan!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel throws it away again.

  DANIEL
     Ka!

  ANNOTATION
     They do this about three times and Daniel begins
     to laugh. The Unas also laughs.

  DANIEL
     (laughing) Right err...yes, toss the symbiote
     head! That's very, very popular, very interesting.
     Yes, all the kids are doing this.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel throws it into the fire.

  DANIEL
     Oh look out! In the fire but...

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel reaches into his pocket and brings out a
     chocolate bar.

  DANIEL
     Nan!

  UNAS
     Ka!

  DANIEL
     Now don't say ka until you've tried it!

  ANNOTATION
     He unwraps the bar and the Unas sniffs at it.

  DANIEL
     Nan!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel takes a bite of the bar.

  DANIEL
     Mmmnnnn!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas tries to make a similar sound. Daniel
     offers him the bar. The Unas sniffs it more and
     licks it. Then takes a bite. He attempts to make a
     Mmmnnn sound.

  DANIEL
     Mmmnnnn!

  UNAS
     Mmmnnnn!

  DANIEL
     That's funny, I err...met my father-in-law like
     this!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas continues making mmmnnnn sounds.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, like that!

  EXT-CAMP IN FOREST, NIGHT


  ANNOTATION
     Members of the search team are asleep on the
     ground. O'Neill is awake and sitting up next to a
     sleeping Rothman. Hawkins is asleep nearby with
     his back to the others.

  O'NEILL
     (whispering) Rothman?

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman murmurs in his sleep but doesn't wake up
     so O'Neill throws his hat at him. Rothman sits up
     suddenly awake.

  ROTHMAN
     (sleepily) What? Colonel?

  O'NEILL
     Have you noticed anything weird about Hawkins?

  ROTHMAN
     (sleepily) Weird?

  O'NEILL
     Different.

  ROTHMAN
     Different?

  O'NEILL
     Odd.

  ROTHMAN
     Odd?

  O'NEILL
     (annoyed) Rothman!

  ROTHMAN
     Oh, I'm still not awake yet, Colonel. I'm sorry.

  O'NEILL
     Well, you work with him! Just tell me if you
     notice anything out of the ordinary.

  ANNOTATION
     Rothman pulls his glasses on and squints at
     Hawkins. Carter, who is awake nearby, also looks
     at Hawkins who is still asleep.

  ROTHMAN
     He seems like...Hawkins. I mean, that's the way he
     is.

  O'NEILL
     You sure?

  ROTHMAN
     No, it's not my thing.

  O'NEILL
     What isn't?

  ROTHMAN
     People. I mean, give me a million year old fossil,
     and I'll tell you what it had for breakfast but
     I'm not too good at people. They're too recent!

  ANNOTATION
     He lies back down and goes to sleep. Carter and
     O'Neill exchange looks. Back facing the rest of
     the group, Hawkins's eyes suddenly open and glow
     like a Goa'uld.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas sits near to the fire watching it. Daniel
     stands nearby looking at paintings on the cave
     walls. His hands are still tied as he activates
     the recorder and starts talking.

  DANIEL
     I'm in a cave. There are crude drawings,
     pictographs. The Unas seems to have a
     comprehension of Goa'uld symbiote species
     structure as well as their ability to blend.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks deeper into the caves, observing the
     drawings on the walls.

  DANIEL
     Obviously the Unas who were taken over must have
     figured out how to work the Stargate and left,
     but...why not all of them?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns and looks at his captor.

  DANIEL
     This Unas wears a strange bony neckpiece. At
     first, I thought it was purely ornamental, but now
     I suspect it must serve as some small safeguard to
     protect against symbiotes penetrating the neck.

  ANNOTATION
     He again looks at the paintings.

  DANIEL
     Some of the aboriginal Unas must have realised
     that their kind were being taken over and taken
     refuge in these caves!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at the drawings on the walls
     depicting Unas hunting captives. He edges further
     into the caves.

  DANIEL
     This is a rite of passage. There are parallels in
     earth culture. For example, the Massai warriors of
     Africa kill lions in order to be recognised as
     adult warriors.

  ANNOTATION
     A growl is heard from behind, and Daniel spins
     round to see the Unas standing immediately behind
     him.

  DANIEL
     I think I understand what it is you are doing!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas grabs Daniel and presses him against the
     wall.

  UNAS
     Wok tah!

  ANNOTATION
     He then uses his claw to cut a long scratch down
     Daniel's face, drawing blood.

  DANIEL
     Ka!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas lets him go from the wall and looks at
     him.

  DANIEL
     Keka?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas pushes Daniel away from the wall and rubs
     the blood from Daniel's face onto the cave wall
     next to a depiction of an Unas with a captive
     human. Daniel stares on horrified.

  DANIEL
     I think I've just been marked for death!


LOCATION--CAMP IN FOREST, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is standing near the water's edge, looking
     over the water. Carter approaches and calls to
     him.

  CARTER
     Teal'c, we're moving out!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c turns his back on the water. A symbiote in
     the water prepares to attack. Teal'c senses this
     and activates his staff weapon. Just as the
     symbiote flies out of the water at him, he fires
     on it killing it. The others come running at the
     staff weapon noise. Teal'c aims the weapon at
     them.

  TEAL'C
     Come no closer!

  ANNOTATION
     They stop and look at Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     What was that?

  TEAL'C
     Lower your weapons!

  O'NEILL
     What?!?

  TEAL'C
     One or more of you may have become host to a
     Goa'uld during your watch!

  ANNOTATION
     They all look surprised.

  CARTER
     Teal'c, that doesn't make any sense! I don't
     sense...

  TEAL'C
     (interrupting) You yourself may have been
     compromised.

  O'NEILL
     Well, what makes you think there are Goa'uld
     around here?

  TEAL'C
     These waters abound with them.

  ANNOTATION
     The water is still bubbling where other symbiotes
     feed on the dead Goa'uld.

  TEAL'C
     Anyone who has ventured near the edge has put
     themselves at risk!

  ROTHMAN
     No, the Goa'uld fossils we found are a millions of
     years old! I've been on this planet for weeks.

  TEAL'C
     Then perhaps you maintain the pretence of being
     human!

  ROTHMAN
     (sarcastically) I think I would know if there was
     a snake in my head.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     I can't explain it, sir. I can't even sense the
     ones that are in the water.

  ROTHMAN
     Daniel and I found no traces of Naquadah in the
     symbiote fossils. Maybe that's why...

  TEAL'C
     (interrupting) Enough! Relinquish your weapons
     immediately!

  GRIFF
     Hold on! How do we know you're not one of them?

  CARTER
     Symbiotes can't blend with a Jaffa.

  GRIFF
     Yeah, well look at my neck. Do you see a scar?

  TEAL'C
     The Goa'uld may enter through the mouth leaving no
     visible scar. Therefore it may be impossible to
     tell who among you has been taken and who has not.

  CARTER
     Sir, Teal'c is right. He's the only one we can be
     sure of, including you and me.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Teal'c considering the situation.
     He then puts his weapon on the ground.

  O'NEILL
     Do as he says.

  ANNOTATION
     The others comply with reserve.

  CARTER
     What about Daniel?

  TEAL'C
     None of you can be trusted to proceed.

  GRIFF
     You think you can bring Daniel back alone?

  TEAL'C
     I do, and I will.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c activates his radio to speak to Coburn and
     his team who are still guarding the Gate.

  TEAL'C
     (to Coburn) Sergeant Coburn?

  EXT-P3X-888 STARGATE, DAY


  COBURN
     (activating radio) Coburn.

  TEAL'C
     (via radio) One or more of our team may have been
     compromised by a Goa'uld parasite.

  ANNOTATION
     Coburn and the other soldier exchange worried
     glances.

  COBURN
     How many?

  TEAL'C
     (via radio) That may be impossible to determine
     until we return with them to Earth.

  EXT-P3X-888 BY WATER, DAY


  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at the others. His staff weapon is
     still aimed at the search team.

  TEAL'C
     I intend to restrain them at this location and
     proceed onward alone.

  O'NEILL
     What?!?

  TEAL'C
     (via radio) I will leave this frequency open so
     that you may locate them and return to the SGC.
     Take extreme caution.

  COBURN
     (via radio) We're on our way. Coburn out.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c takes restraints out of his pack and throws
     them at the feet of Colonel O'Neill who looks down
     at them.

  TEAL'C
     Bind their hands and feet tight with those. I will
     then do the same to you, O'Neill.

  ANNOTATION
     He stares at O'Neill.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel lies on the floor of the cave awake. The
     Unas is asleep nearby. Daniel sits up slowly and
     looks at the Unas. He picks up a large stone to
     hit the Unas in the head. But then he looks at the
     sleeping Unas and can't go ahead with killing it.
     He lets the stone fall to the ground with a loud
     thump. The Unas wakes up and, seeing the stone,
     growls at Daniel. Daniel holds his hands up.

  DANIEL
     It's ok, it's ok.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas leans on its hand that was injured by the
     soldier's gunfire, and reacts with pain.

  DANIEL
     Look, I can help you with that, if you let me.

  ANNOTATION
     He points at the wound on the Unas'hand.

  DANIEL
     But you have to trust me!

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas looks down at his hand, which is bleeding
     with a green blood. He then looks back up at
     Daniel.


LOCATION--P3X-888 CAMP BY WATER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The others are already tied up. O'Neill is now
     being restrained by Teal'c.

  O'NEILL
     (quietly to Teal'c) I'm tellin' ya, it's got to be
     Hawkins.

  TEAL'C
     Trust in me, O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     What if I'm not O'Neill?

  TEAL'C
     Then I was not talking to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c walks away, leaving them tied up.

  GRIFF
     (annoyed) What if one of those Unas come by? What
     do we do then?

  CARTER
     Teal'c didn't have any other choice, Captain!

  GRIFF
     (scoffing) Yeah?

  ANNOTATION
     Hawkins watches the others, looking mad.


LOCATION--CAVE

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel works on the Unas's hand using some
     tweezers. The Unas is breathing hard as Daniel
     pulls the bullet out.

  DANIEL
     I don't suppose you know the story of Androcles
     and the lion?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas stares at the splinter.

  UNAS
     (looking at Daniel) Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at him confused. He has a long wound
     on his cheek from the Unas claw.

  DANIEL
     What is Chaka?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas looks away.

  DANIEL
     Look, obviously we don't need to be enemies here.
     I mean err...I want to go home. I mean, don't get
     me wrong, it has been a hoot but err...I did just
     pass up the chance to kill you so...

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas pulls on the rope lead for the binding on
     Daniel's hands. Daniel looks at him, annoyed.

  DANIEL
     (quietly) Please, let me go!

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel picks up a piece of charcoal from the
     remains of the fire as the Unas pulls him to his
     feet, and they set off further into the caves. On
     the way past one wall, Daniel stops and quickly
     writes something on it. The Unas looks at the
     writing confused and then drags Daniel off again.


LOCATION--CAMP BY WATER, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     The search party, minus Teal'c, are still
     restrained and sitting at the camp.

  ROTHMAN
     This is ridiculous, I'm not a Goa'uld!

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) Well then, why didn't you say so?
     We could have straightened this whole thing out!

  ANNOTATION
     Major Hawkins struggles quietly with his
     restraints. His wrists are cut from the
     struggling.

  HAWKINS
     So which one of you is it?

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) All right, anybody with a snake in
     their head raise their hands!

  ANNOTATION
     Hawkins's eyes glow suddenly. He breaks his
     restraints and stands up.

  O'NEILL
     Damn! Err...Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     Hawkins makes his way over to O'Neill, picking up
     a weapon on the way.

  O'NEILL
     Teal'c...Teal'c...Teal'c!

  ANNOTATION
     Hawkins prepares to fire at O'Neill. Just as he is
     about to shoot he is shot in the back twice by a
     staff weapon. His eyes glow once more and then
     fade out as he falls to the ground face first.
     Teal'c appears from the forest and walks over to
     O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Well, that took you long enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c leans down to release O'Neill of his
     bindings.

  TEAL'C
     You are welcome, O'Neill. I knew if there was a
     Goa'uld among you he would be strong enough to
     free himself.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill nods as Teal'c goes to free the others.

  CARTER
     You had to wait long enough to make sure Hawkins
     wasn't the only one?

  TEAL'C
     (smiles briefly) Yes!

  GRIFF
     (to Teal'c) Are you satisfied now?

  TEAL'C
     I am.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c goes to free Rothman.

  ROTHMAN
     I'm glad that's over with!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c frees Rothman's feet but as he goes to free
     his hands he notices that Rothman too has been
     struggling to free his hands, and there is blood
     around his wrists. Teal'c looks at him confused as
     Rothman's eyes glow. Rothman breaks his wrist
     bindings, stands up, knocking Teal'c to the
     ground, and grabs his staff weapon. He manages to
     fire at Griff in the shoulder just as Griff is
     standing. As Griff falls, O'Neill grabs his weapon
     and fires repeatedly at Rothman, killing him.
     O'Neill stares at Rothman's body in shock. Carter
     runs to help Griff, who is lying on the ground
     holding his shoulder in pain. Teal'c recovers and
     goes to free Pierce.

  O'NEILL
     (to Griff) You going to live?

  GRIFF
     (in pain) Yeah, I think so!

  O'NEILL
     Meet up with Coburn. Head back to the Stargate.

  GRIFF
     Yeah! How long do you figure he was a Goa'uld?

  PIERCE
     Could have been the whole time, we just didn't
     know.

  CARTER
     They deserve a decent burial, sir.

  O'NEILL
     Yes, they do.

  GRIFF
     We'll take care of it, sir. Go find Doctor
     Jackson.

  O'NEILL
     (quietly) Yeah.

  INT-CAVE


  ANNOTATION
     The Unas leads Daniel into a large cavern. Daniel
     is still making markings on the walls. The sounds
     of other Unas are heard.


LOCATION--CAVE ENTRANCE, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c enter the cave with
     their weapons drawn. The find the remains of the
     fire, and Teal'c bends down to inspect it.

  TEAL'C
     We are very close behind.

  ANNOTATION
     They then discover the cave paintings and see the
     smear of Daniel's blood next to a drawing.

  O'NEILL
     It's red. There's not much of it. That's
     something.

  TEAL'C
     This way!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is looking at the markings that Daniel
     made. O'Neill approaches and shines his light on
     the markings. They read 'this way' with an arrow
     underneath them.

  O'NEILL
     (sarcastically) You're good!

  ANNOTATION
     They move further into the caves.

  INT-MAIN CAVERN


  ANNOTATION
     The Unas leads Daniel into a large cavern that is
     obviously inhabited by the Unas of the planet.
     There are fires and other items all over the
     place.

  DANIEL
     Look, I know we've got the beginnings of a
     beautiful friendship here, but I'm not sure your
     folks are going to understand.

  ANNOTATION
     A loud deep growl is heard and the shadow of a
     large Unas can be seen from another entrance to
     the cavern. Daniel stops with his captor and looks
     on in fear. The large Unas appears and approaches
     them growling loudly. The young Unas cowers back.

  INT-CAVE TUNNELS


  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 are following Daniel's markings to the
     cavern. They hear the growls of the Unas nearby
     and hurry on.

  INT-MAIN CAVERN


  ANNOTATION
     The alpha male approaches Daniel, but the young
     Unas steps in front to talk to him.

  UNAS
     Ka! Ka keka!

  ANNOTATION
     The alpha male looks down at the young one
     growling.

  UNAS
     Ka nan, tok! Chaka, ska nat, Chaka!

  ANNOTATION
     At that moment SG-1 enter with their weapons drawn
     ready to fire. Daniel sees them and puts his hands
     up to stop them.

  DANIEL
     Don't, don't! Don't shoot!

  ANNOTATION
     SG-1 stop and take defensive positions.

  ANNOTATION
     The alpha male sees the others and roars very
     loudly. Other Unas appear from further inside the
     caves. They start to move forward but the young
     Unas talks again. He is pleading with the alpha
     male for Daniel's life evidently.

  UNAS
     (to alpha male) Cho'ee'che!

  DANIEL
     (to others) This started out as some sort of rite
     of passage. I think the alpha male was expecting
     the younger one to offer me up for some kind of
     feast.

  UNAS
     (to alpha male) Tok. Chaka, ka nan!

  DANIEL
     Instead I think the younger one's trying to bring
     me into his clan.

  CARTER
     Why?

  DANIEL
     We've communicated. We're friends!

  O'NEILL
     Friends?!?

  ANNOTATION
     One of the other Unas approaches, swinging a club.

  UNAS
     Ka!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Teal'c and Carter aim their weapons.
     Daniel raises his hand again to stop them.

  DANIEL
     Don't! I think the younger one's trying to tell
     the clan that he's found something good for them.

  O'NEILL
     And they're buying that?

  DANIEL
     No, I don't think so.

  ANNOTATION
     The alpha male approaches Daniel to attack. Daniel
     raises his bound hands to protect himself.

  DANIEL
     Ka keka!

  ANNOTATION
     The alpha male stops, surprised, and backs away
     slightly.

  O'NEILL
     Daniel?

  CARTER
     What did you just say?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is staring at the alpha male with a
     frightened look.

  DANIEL
     I think I just asked him not to kill me!

  ANNOTATION
     The alpha male suddenly attacks the young Unas
     knocking him to the ground. He then goes for
     Daniel who ducks to avoid him. Just as the alpha
     male approaches, O'Neill and Carter open fire on
     the alpha male hitting him several times in the
     chest. The alpha male staggers back only wounded
     and not dead. As it attempts to attack Daniel
     again the young Unas recovers and attacks the
     alpha male. In its wounded state the alpha male is
     overpowered and drowned by the young Unas in a
     shallow pool. O'Neill and the others look on still
     ready to fire. The other Unas from further inside
     the cave look at the young Unas who then gives out
     a loud roar. The other Unas all bow at him.

  DANIEL
     He's just become the alpha male.

  ANNOTATION
     The young Unas growls at the others and they
     retreat back into the depths of the caves. He then
     turns to Daniel.

  UNAS
     Dan'el?

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas gestures for Daniel to accompany him into
     the caves. Daniel shakes his head.

  DANIEL
     Ka. I have to go now. Thank you. Chaka.

  ANNOTATION
     The Unas growls softly, turns, and leaves. O'Neill
     and Carter stand up from their defensive positions
     and walk over to Daniel. As the Unas leaves the
     cavern, it stops and looks at Daniel.

  UNAS
     Chaka!

  O'NEILL
     What'd that mean?

  DANIEL
     I have no idea...but I think I've just been
     invited to come back one day and find out.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, O'Neill and Teal'c look at Daniel as the
     Unas leaves the cavern.
