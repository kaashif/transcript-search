People are bustling to and fro, with evidence everywhere of communal living. Tables, food stuffs, water, a stove -- these are all readily accessible in the public areas.

There is a yellow and black shield mounted on the wall above the throne along with swords and other weapons. On the dais, several women surround a figure seated on a throne. One woman steps back, revealing the face of the 'king'. Eyes closed, he's blissfully enjoying a bright red fruit.</td></tr>

Then Daniel is struck in the stomach by a staff weapon as another Jaffa attacks him. Teal'c floors one guard, then turns swiftly to fire his staff weapon as another begins to charge down the stairs. Trelak drops Maybourne and rushes forward to jump Teal'c from behind. He attempts to choke Teal'c, who tried to throw him off. Maybourne comes to and sits up, clutching his throat. Teal'c throws Trelak over his head, smashing him into the ground. Daniel is forced back against the table, a staff weapon across his throat. He's choking. Trelak throws a stone at Teal'c's eye, buying enough time to snatch up a small wooden bench nearby. He breaks the bench over Teal'c's stooped back and as Teal'c falls, kicks him savagely in the ribs. The kick is hard enough to lift Teal'c and throw him onto his side. Trelak draws his blade.</td></tr>

<tr id="L412"><td><a href="#L412">412</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Maybourne creeps up behind Trelak and breaks pottery over his head. A moment later, Maybourne lands heavily on his back, some distance away. Teal'c blocks Trelak's arm as he strikes with his blade and the two freeze, glowering at one another hatefully. Trelak's hand shakes as he tries to break Teal'c's hold on him. Maybourne jumps up holding a pipe, but he hesitates as Trelak takes a two-handed grip on his blade and Teal'c is forced to match him. The two struggle desperately, in silence. Meanwhile Daniel is losing his own fight. Suddenly, the Jaffa warrior pinning Daniel cries out and falls forward, an arrow in his back. It was fired by Garan. Daniel pushes the dead Jaffa clear as Garan calmly reloads. Teal'c shakes as he and Trelak force the blade down between their bodies. He is clenching his teeth against the strain of forcing the blade towards Trelak. The First Prime's face begins to change as Teal'c makes a huge effort and drives the blade into him.</td></tr>
