LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  MITCHELL
     Come back and rejoin SG-1.

  CARTER
     (half smiles) I have my reasons for wanting this
     job.

  MITCHELL
     What if the world needs saving?

  CARTER
     If the world needs saving, I will be there to do
     what I can.


LOCATION--DANIEL'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Vala slaps the kor mak bracelet on Daniel's wrist
     while grabbing it's twin from his hand. Daniel
     looks alarmed and tugs at the bracelet strapped to
     his wrist.

  VOICEOVER FROM 9.04 THE TIES THAT BIND


  ARLOS
     The bracelets create a physiological bond between
     the wearers. They were used by the Goa'uld.

LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Vala steps through the Stargate while Daniel
     watches at the bottom of the ramp.


LOCATION--SGC CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel feels faint and collapses. Mitchell
     attempts to catch him as he falls.

  MITCHELL
     Jackson? Jackson!


LOCATION--SGC INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Lam stand by Daniel's bedside.

  LAM
     You were completely unresponsive when we brought
     you in. But your condition suddenly improved when
     SHE came back.

  ANNOTATION
     Confused, Daniel turns and looks at the bed to his
     right. Vala raises herself from the bed to lean on
     her arm and smile at him.

  VALA
     Miss me?

  SCENES FROM 9.03 ORIGIN



LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Garek looks down into the Gate Room to watch
     travelers arriving through the Stargate. Landry
     comes to join him.

  GERAK
     Who is that?

  LANDRY
     A gentleman who claims that he represents some
     gods called the Ori. There are as many humans out
     there as there are Jaffa. If we don't continue to
     work together, the victory we worked so long and
     hard for could result in chaos.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior spontaneously bursts into flames in the
     crowded room. Landry looks surprised.


LOCATION--KALLANA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     On a desert planet, five male Jaffa carrying staff
     weapons and a female Jaffa, Birra, hurry towards
     an active Stargate. A Prior of the Ori stands by
     the DHD. He holds a book and a blue orbed staff.

  BIRRA
     You show no fear, Latal.

  LATAL
     He is one man. What is there to fear?

  BIRRA
     He promised retribution if we did not bow to their
     gods upon his return.

  LATAL
     The Jaffa have shed too much blood to replace one
     false god with another. We have made our decision,
     and we will tell him.

  ANNOTATION
     The group move around stone ruins to stand before
     the Prior. The Prior is whispering prayers to
     himself. He stops when the Jaffa reach him with
     their staff weapons aimed and primed at him.

  LATAL
     Have you come alone?

  PRIOR
     The Ori are with me always. You have read from The
     Book of Origin?

  LATAL
     We have.

  PRIOR
     What say you to the promise of the Ori?

  LATAL
     We will hear no more of false gods. Go now, and we
     will spare your life.

  PRIOR
     (looks slightly surprised) You speak for all?

  LATAL
     We do.

  PRIOR
     One way or another, this world WILL serve their
     purpose.

  ANNOTATION
     The orb on the Prior's staff glows brightly.

  LATAL
     Jaffa!

  ANNOTATION
     The Jaffa fire their weapons at the Prior. The
     blasts are merely absorbed before they reach the
     Prior by an invisible force field. Birra gives a
     worried look to Latal. He continues firing. The
     Prior pounds the base of the staff into the sand.
     Birra steps back and Latal swallows. The Prior
     tilts his staff forward. All six Jaffa are thrown
     back through the air and disappear into the
     horizon. Near where they were standing, a blue
     energy field rises from the ground. The Prior hugs
     his book and begins to mutter prayers in a foreign
     tongue, 'sanctus Ori' etc. The blue energy field
     forms a boundary around him and the Stargate.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The Stargate activates with the iris closed.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman sits at a control station. Landry speaks
     to an SG team near the spiral staircase.

  HARRIMAN
     Unscheduled offworld activation.

  LANDRY
     (moving next to him) What've we got, Chief?

  HARRIMAN
     Receiving a message, sir. It's text only.

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor in front of Harriman fills with data.
     Landry looks towards the Stargate, which
     deactivates at that moment. Harriman blinks and
     leans back.

  HARRIMAN
     It's in Goa'uld.

  LANDRY
     None of you folks read Goa'uld, do you?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry leaves the control room.


LOCATION--SGC RECREATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A basketball game is in progress, Mitchell and
     Daniel are on one team, Vala and Teal'c on the
     other. Daniel feints with the ball, while Vala
     tries to block him. He passes to Mitchell who
     heads towards the basket, but is pushed to one
     side by Teal'c as he shoots. He falls down as Vala
     catches the rebound. Teal'c lifts Vala, and she
     slam dunks the basketball through the net with a
     grunt, hanging from the rim for a second.

  VALA
     Yeah! Whoo!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c lets her down. She keeps her arms raised
     and swings her hip to the side to bump against
     Teal'c in a celebratory gesture. Mitchell and
     Daniel laugh as Mitchell retrieves the ball.

  VALA
     You boys aren't going to let people from two
     different planets beat you at your own silly game,
     are you?

  DANIEL
     (pointing a finger at her) "Silly game" isn't over
     yet.

  MITCHELL
     (pointing at Daniel) That's my wingman.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell tosses the ball over to Daniel.

  VALA
     You need a new wingman.

  DANIEL
     I'm gonna kick your ass.

  VALA
     (swinging her hips in a taunting gesture)
     Promises. Promises.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel passes the ball to Mitchell who swerves to
     avoid Teal'c. Teal'c knocks him aside, and the
     ball flies backwards over Mitchell's shoulder.
     Both Mitchell and Teal'c move to retrieve the
     ball, but Landry walks through the door at that
     moment and catches it. Mitchell tries to regain
     his balance and stand at attention.

  LANDRY
     As you were, Colonel. Actually I was looking for
     Teal'c.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell leans forward, hands resting on his knees
     and catches his breath. Teal'c and the others
     gather around Landry.

  LANDRY
     We received a communiqu from a Goa'uld named
     Nerus. Ring any bells?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Vala exchange looks.

  TEAL'C
     I am aware of his identity. He was a minor Goa'uld
     who served Ba'al for many centuries.

  LANDRY
     What can you tell me about him?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c opens his mouth to respond, but Vala
     interrupts.

  VALA
     Honestly you don't want to know.

  LANDRY
     Honestly I do.

  VALA
     (puzzled) Why?

  LANDRY
     What do you say we go with the idea that I'm in
     charge, and I've asked a simple question.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala swallows and catches her breath from their
     activities. She looks at Teal'c for confirmation
     as she answers Landry's question.

  VALA
     Hmm. Nerus defines avarice and gluttony. Simple
     answer?

  TEAL'C
     (nodding in agreement) Mmm. He is a Goa'uld known
     for his many...appetites.

  DANIEL
     He's also known as an inventor responsible for a
     host of Goa'uld technologies.

  MITCHELL
     Really?

  LANDRY
     That's when I started paying attention to him,
     too. Weird as it sounds, he's offering to work for
     us.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone exchanges thoughtful looks.

  TEAL'C
     Nerus is not to be trusted.

  LANDRY
     Hmm. Funny--he had nice things to say about you.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry shoots the basketball, and it swishes
     through the hoop. Landry turns and leaves.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel is sitting at the table, reading a report.
     Across from him sit Mitchell and Teal'c. Vala
     stands behind Teal'c leaning on the back of his
     chair.

  DANIEL
     No, he really did. He said some very nice things.
     "I would consider it a great honor to meet the
     heroes of the Tau'ri who brought the Goa'uld to
     their knees."

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, that is nice.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala circles the table.

  VALA
     (fiercely) No. He's disgusting. You can't honestly
     open the doors to a pathetic minor Goa'uld posing
     as one of the big boys. Well at least promise me
     you're intending on torturing him.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala has circled all the way around the table and
     stands by Daniel. Landry enters the room.

  LANDRY
     We're setting him up in the VIP suite.

  VALA
     (sitting in the end chair in shock) No.

  LANDRY
     Yes.

  MITCHELL
     Sir, if you don't mind my asking...

  LANDRY
     Why?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  DANIEL
     Well, according to his communiqu, he's in
     possession of "military intelligence of the utmost
     urgency."

  LANDRY
     Sounded like it was worth a listen.

  MITCHELL
     Still, why throw in with us? Why not stay with
     Ba'al or work with some other Goa'uld?

  LANDRY
     Well, look at it in terms of optics. We must look
     like major players now.

  TEAL'C
     By defeating Anubis.

  DANIEL
     Most of the system lords were killed by the
     Replicators. Then, we defeated the Replicators.

  MITCHELL
     Wow, we look cool.

  LANDRY
     Don't let it go to your head.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala has pulled the report closer to her and is
     reading it.

  VALA
     (snorting with laughter) Have you seen his list of
     dietary requirements?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel pulls the classified report away from Vala
     with a glare.

  LANDRY
     Already taken care of.

  DANIEL
     (reading) Ripened Trakeel eggs?

  LANDRY
     We got eggs. I don't know if they're ripe or not.
     SG-3 is with him on a neutral planet doing a
     security check as we speak. As soon as they give
     the green light, I want you to--

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of the Stargate spinning is heard.

  HARRIMAN
     (over intercom) Offworld activation.

  LANDRY
     Speak of the devil.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel closes the report and looks around. Vala
     shakes her head.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SG-3 and Nerus, wearing a plain brown robe, arrive
     through the active Stargate. Vala, Daniel, Teal'c,
     Landry, and Mitchell stand at the base of the
     ramp. Landry steps forward to meet Nerus.

  SERGEANT
     He's clean, sir.

  LANDRY
     Thank you, Sergeant, we'll take it from here.

  NERUS
     (in Goa'uld echoing voice) I am Nerus.

  LANDRY
     (bowing slightly) Major General Hank Landry. I'm
     in command of Stargate--

  NERUS
     (dismissively) Yes, I'm sure you're a very
     important person, and you had very important
     reasons to subject me to your security
     precautions.

  ANNOTATION
     While speaking, Nerus raises his right hand,
     wearing an ostentatiously large red ring, and
     steps past Landry, moving to the bottom of the
     ramp to stand in front of Teal'c.

  NERUS
     (to Teal'c) But to meet you. To look upon the face
     of the one...

  MITCHELL
     The one what?

  NERUS
     The one who inspired the great uprising, of
     course. Oh, the time of false gods is at an end in
     no small part because of this man.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel raises an eyebrow and glances at Vala. He
     does not notice Nerus has moved to stand in front
     of him until the Goa'uld continues to speak.

  NERUS
     Doctor Daniel Jackson. It is rumored among the
     Goa'uld that you alone defeated Anubis. Is that
     true?

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus gives Daniel a conspiratorial wink.

  DANIEL
     (cautiously) Where'd you hear that?

  NERUS
     Oh, I hear everything.

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus laughs heartily. Vala looks amused at
     Daniel's discomfiture. Nerus moves to stand in
     front of Mitchell and looks puzzled.

  MITCHELL
     Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell, leader of
     SG-1.

  NERUS
     But you...you're not...?

  MITCHELL
     No.

  NERUS
     (hopeful) Will he be here?

  MITCHELL
     Nope.

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus looks disappointed and turns to Vala.

  NERUS
     And you...you're not even Colonel Carter, are you?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala looks at him blankly. She exchanges glances
     with Daniel and rolls her eyes.

  NERUS
     (visibly upset) This isn't at all the way I
     imagined it would be.

  LANDRY
     Nerus, if you'd follow me to our briefing room, we
     have much to discuss.

  NERUS
     Yes, yes. But first I must have sustenance. Have
     you met all my dietary requirements?

  LANDRY
     (exasperated) As much as humanly possible.

  NERUS
     Oh good, good, because I'm positively famished.

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Nerus leave the Gate Room. SG-3 follows
     behind them, two of them carrying a large trunk.
     Vala turns to Daniel, Teal'c and Mitchell with her
     arms crossed and an "I told you so" expression on
     her face. The four follow the last member of SG-3
     out of the Gate Room.


LOCATION--KALLANA, DAY

  ANNOTATION
     A number of Jaffa fire staff weapons and a machine
     gun at the blue energy field with no effect. The
     Prior remains standing within the force field near
     the still active Stargate.


LOCATION--SGC VIP ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The room has been decorated with Greco-Roman
     busts, ivy and other artwork. A large dining table
     is in the center of the room, filled with silver
     bowls and platters of fruits and cheeses. Teal'c
     studies a fresco on the far wall. Vala stands on
     one side of the table with her arms crossed. On
     the other side of the table, Landry, Mitchell, and
     Daniel stand. At least one SF is stationed just
     outside the open door. Nerus plucks a few grapes
     from a bunch on the table and plops them into his
     mouth.

  NERUS
     (chewing in surprise) Mmm. Mmm! No seeds! How is
     that possible?

  DANIEL
     It's a state secret, but we're willing to
     negotiate.

  NERUS
     (pleased) That's impossible...but delicious. Mmm.
     Mmm. Mmm. Still...

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus clears his throat loudly. When he continues
     speaking, it is in a normal human voice.

  NERUS
     Still, we have important matters to discuss, don't
     we?

  MITCHELL
     Your voice just changed.

  NERUS
     (chuckling) Oh, we don't have to talk that way.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala sits on the table and starts munching on the
     fruit and cheese. Daniel exchanges looks with
     Teal'c, Mitchell, and Landry.

  NERUS
     This...is a device...that I invented. What you're
     about to see occurred...nearly two days ago.

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus takes a small device out of his trunk and
     sets it on the table. He presses a button and
     steps back. A three dimensional holographic image
     of Kallana rotates a foot above the
     table.</blockquote> NERUS Now the free Jaffa who
     claim this planet call it "Kallana." [A small blue
     circle appears on the image of the planet.

  VALA
     (mouth full) What was that?

  TEAL'C
     (stepping closer) The formation of an extremely
     large force field around the planet's Stargate.

  NERUS
     Brilliant.

  MITCHELL
     And you're sharing this information with us
     because...?

  NERUS
     Why are you so surprised? We joined forces to
     destroy the Replicators.

  TEAL'C
     I have no recollection of your participation.

  NERUS
     Teal'c, you wound me. I was the one who figured
     out how to activate all of the Stargates in the
     galaxy at once. Didn't Ba'al mention that to you?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c opens his mouth to respond, but Vala
     interrupts, still nibbling on food.

  VALA
     That is so like him.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c glares at Vala, but she smiles and winks at
     him, enjoying some cheese. Teal'c sighs.

  NERUS
     (voice falling in disappointment) Isn't it,
     though. (recovering) That's all right. Your
     adversaries call themselves the Ori.

  LANDRY
     We know all about the Ori.

  NERUS
     Yes, well, thus far, I detect only a single
     individual, no doubt a Prior, inside the force
     field but...it is expanding.

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus turns off the device.

  TEAL'C
     Then it will soon be able to accommodate entire
     armies.

  NERUS
     (sitting with a grunt) Yes, and furthermore, the
     Stargate itself has not shut down since it opened.

  DANIEL
     Wait a minute, you said this happened two days
     ago?

  NERUS
     Yes.

  MITCHELL
     Thirty-eight minutes is the maximum time a
     Stargate can stay open. That's a law of wormhole
     physics.

  VALA
     (popping a nut into her mouth) Not according to
     the Ori.

  DANIEL
     Which means they have a power source which can
     indefinitely maintain a wormhole from another
     galaxy, plus this force field. A ZPM can't even do
     that.

  TEAL'C
     How are we to do battle with an enemy so powerful?

  NERUM
     (after a silence) With my help. Every force field
     has a weakness, and I am confident that I shall
     find it.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks suspicious. Vala shakes her head,
     eyes wide.

  MITCHELL
     (to Landry) Sir, if this intel is correct, it
     represents a complete change of tactics. We'll
     have to respond.

  LANDRY
     I agree, Colonel. But if this Kallana is a Jaffa
     world, I'm not sure how this is our fight.

  NERUS
     (standing) Not your fight? You engineered the
     downfall of the Goa'uld. This is very much a
     galaxy of your own making, General. And you must
     take responsibility.

  LANDRY
     What would you have us do?

  NERUS
     Attack them as quickly as possible with as much
     force as you can bring to bear. This is nothing
     short of an invasion, General. Like it or not,
     you're in a state of war.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks concerned.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY


LOCATION--LANDRY'S OFFICE

  ANNOTATION
     Landry is talking on the telephone, pacing back
     and forth by his desk.

  LANDRY
     Jack...Jack, Jack! She practically invented the
     Mark IX, and you're the one who thinks we should
     use the damned thing. Why are you wasting valuable
     time saying no? (pauses and listens to the phone)
     I've read enough of your SG-1 mission reports to
     know that there were times when no one else but
     Samantha Carter could have pulled your ass out of
     the fire. Well, this is one of those ti--

  ANNOTATION
     Landry turns in his pacing and sees Carter in full
     dress uniform standing in the doorway.

  CARTER
     (with slight nod) Reporting as ordered, sir.

  LANDRY
     (sighing and speaking into phone) Yeah. She's
     standing right here. You're a funny man, Jack.
     Very funny.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Landry with an embarrassed smile.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     SGC military personnel stand at the base of the
     ramp and watch the inner ring of the Stargate
     spin. Three chevrons are already encoded.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman sits at a console. Beside him, Teal'c,
     Mitchell, Daniel and Vala stand. All are dressed
     in black BDUs, fully geared for a mission. Vala
     has accessorized her outfit with a long beige
     scarf.

  HARRIMAN
     Chevron Four encoded.

  VALA
     I promise you he's lying.

  DANIEL
     About which part?

  VALA
     All of it.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sighs in exasperation.

  HARRIMAN
     Chevron Five encoded.

  TEAL'C
     Yet we have been unable to dial the coordinates to
     Kellana despite several attempts.

  VALA
     Goa'uld don't do anything for anyone other than
     themselves.

  HARRIMAN
     Chevron Six encoded.

  MITCHELL
     Maybe it's in his own interest to stop the Ori.

  HARRIMAN
     (looking back at Mitchell) Chevron Seven still
     will not lock.

  LANDRY
     All right, we've tried that long enough. Colonel
     Carter?

  ANNOTATION
     Landry and Carter are in the back of the control
     room. Carter is also dressed in black and geared
     up. The others, including Harriman, turn and
     approach them.

  CARTER
     We've revised the original plan slightly to
     expedite matters. The Prometheus is en route and
     will rendezvous with us at P4C-452. We'll proceed
     to Kellana from there. Now, considering their
     unique ability to maintain an active Stargate
     indefinitely and their force field capabilities,
     the President has authorized any and all means to
     complete the mission.

  MITCHELL
     (muttering to Teal'c beside him) Oh, boy. Here I
     was trying to have a 'nuke free career.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c raises an eyebrow.

  CARTER
     We've been developing something at Area 51 that
     General O'Neill believes will be our best chance
     to stop them right here, right now.

  VALA
     But you don't agree.

  CARTER
     (pausing) I agree we have to try. I just don't
     think it'll be enough.

  LANDRY
     It's what we've got. Questions?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala raises her hand. Daniel quickly grabs it and
     lowers it to her side.

  MITCHELL
     (glancing at Vala and Daniel) No, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala pulls her arm free from Daniel's grasp. They
     look away from each other, equally annoyed.

  LANDRY
     Still no response from the Jaffa Council?

  TEAL'C
     None as of yet.

  LANDRY
     Well, we can't wait for Gerak. We proceed as
     planned. Chief, dial the gate.

  HARRIMAN
     Yes, sir.

  LANDRY
     Move out.

  ANNOTATION
     Harriman returns to his console and begins
     dialing. Teal'c, Daniel, Vala, Carter, and
     Mitchell head down the staircase. Landry
     approaches the control room window to watch.


LOCATION--SGC GATE ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A wormhole forms. Daniel, Carter, Mitchell and
     Teal'c stand at the base of the ramp, checking
     their weapons. Vala meanders around the back of
     the room.

  DANIEL
     (smiling at Carter) Well, temporary or not, it's
     good to have you back.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter smiles in response.

  MITCHELL
     How good is this? Got the band back together.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c pauses and looks at Mitchell quizzically.
     Carter glances back at Vala and leans closer to
     Daniel.

  CARTER
     Yeah, so what's with the extra back-up singer?

  ANNOTATION
     Vala, overhearing, leans against the back wall of
     the room and sulks.

  MITCHELL
     Aw, she's good fun. Plus we figured if Jackson
     were to...

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell pauses.

  TEAL'C
     Die.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, that's the word. It would jeopardize the
     mission.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks at Daniel, worried. He, in turn, has
     a resigned and put-upon expression on his face.

  CARTER
     When we spoke a couple of weeks ago, you said you
     thought the effect of the bracelets was wearing
     off.

  DANIEL
     It was. I just didn't want to put it to a test
     from the other side of the galaxy. So...

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods in understanding. Vala makes a loud
     cough and continues to sulk.

  VALA
     (whining) Wow. You're just dying to get rid of me
     now, aren't you?

  DANIEL
     (drawing out the words) No. Not dying to.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala approaches them, stepping onto the gate ramp
     and facing the four.

  VALA
     (irritated) Oh no, I know I'm not welcome here.
     Despite all my efforts to try and fit into your
     little stargating club, you can all rest assured
     that as soon as I can safely part Daniel's company
     without killing the both of us, I will.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala winks sarcastically towards Mitchell and
     Teal'c and starts to head up the ramp. She spins
     and points at Landry, who's watching from the
     control room window.

  VALA
     (to Landry) Oh, and you. You will wish you had
     listened to me when I said letting the Goa'uld
     come here was a mistake.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala tosses her scarf over her shoulder and
     flounces through the gate with a satisfied smirk.
     The remaining four exchange looks.

  LANDRY
     (over intercom) Get to it. And good luck.

  MITCHELL
     Right. Let's do this.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter, Daniel, Mitchell, and Teal'c head up the
     ramp.

  ANNOTATION
     Prometheus is in orbit around the planet
     designated as P4C-452.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Pendergast walks through a corridor. He meets up
     with Carter, Mitchell, Daniel, Teal'c and Vala.
     Carter and Mitchell salute Pendergast.

  MITCHELL
     Request permission to come aboard.

  ANNOTATION
     Pendergast returns the salute.

  PENDERGAST
     (chuckling) Shaft! Welcome back to the Prometheus.

  MITCHELL
     Thank you, Colonel.

  CARTER
     (low, to Mitchell) Shaft?

  MITCHELL
     My call sign. Cam...shaft.

  CARTER
     Oh.

  VALA
     Yeah, disappointing, isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter hides a smile as Vala smirks. Pendergast
     picks up a nearby phone and speaks into it.

  PENDERGAST
     Flight deck, this is Pendergast. SG-1 is aboard.
     Engage hyperdrive and proceed to Kellana, best
     possible speed.

  CARTER
     Is the Mark IX ready to go?

  PENDERGAST
     Standing by for your systems check. I hear you're
     in a hurry.

  TEAL'C
     You heard correctly.

  ANNOTATION
     They move towards the elevator.

  VALA
     What is a Mark IX exactly?

  MITCHELL
     It's also known as a "gate buster".

  VALA
     Mmm. Sounds big.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala gives Daniel a knowing look.

  MITCHELL
     (in low, serious voice) Some might say too big.

  VALA
     (still looking at Daniel) Really? I've always
     thought there was no such thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala looks down and fusses with the tassels in her
     scarf. Carter gives Daniel and Vala a questioning
     look. Pendergast and Teal'c glance over,
     exchanging amused glances with Mitchell. Daniel
     pulls Vala's scarf off her neck.

  DANIEL
     (clearing throat) Vala, this is a military vessel.

  VALA
     I know, darling. I've stolen it before.

  DANIEL
     Well, just try to be uh...

  ANNOTATION
     The elevator doors open. Carter, Pendergast,
     Mitchell, and Teal'c enter the elevator. Daniel
     and Vala remain facing each other, ignoring the
     rest.

  VALA
     My charming self?

  DANIEL
     Just a little less talk; a little more,
     shut-the-hell up.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sharply nods as a final emphasis to his
     statement, spins and walks the rest of the way
     down the corridor to join the others in the
     elevator. Vala turns and follows. Her hair is in
     twin ponytails which she plays with in an
     expression of disdain. She stands in the center of
     the elevator, folds her arms across her chest, and
     pouts as the doors close.

     The Prometheus enters hyperspace.


LOCATION--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT


LOCATION--SGC VIP ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus sits at the table, gorging on food and
     drink. Landry enters the room from behind him.

  NERUS
     (talking around a mouthful of food) General! Ho
     ho! Join me for a glass of wine. It's from a place
     called "France".

  ANNOTATION
     Landry dismisses the offer with a wave of his hand
     and walks further down the table.

  LANDRY
     I'm on duty.

  NERUS
     (taking another mouthful of food) What is this?
     This is exquisite. What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     He grabs another handful of food and holds it in
     the air.

  LANDRY
     Chicken.

  NERUS
     Chicken?

  LANDRY
     It's a rare delicacy among our people.

  NERUS
     (filling his mouth with the chicken) Mmm! It's
     exquisite. I want more chicken. More chicken!

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus chuckles and continues eating.

  LANDRY
     I'll try to pull some strings. Nerus, this
     arrangement is only going to work if you actually
     do something to help with this problem.

  NERUS
     I was working. I-I-I was deep in thought when you
     walked in.

  LANDRY
     (chuckling) Yeah, I could see that.

  NERUS
     You don't trust me.

  LANDRY
     Of course I don't trust you.

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus reaches forward and turns on his holographic
     device. Kellana appears. The blue force field
     appears to be even larger.

  NERUS
     Now, here is the latest transmission from my
     satellite. As you can see, the force field
     continues to expand in phases, and as it does so,
     it weakens considerably.

  ANNOTATION
     All the while Nerus speaks, he continues to eat
     and drink.

  LANDRY
     Enough to penetrate with our beaming technology?

  NERUS
     Yes, wi-with those nuclear devices that you were
     talking about.

  LANDRY
     Or SG-1. They could talk to this Prior face to
     face.

  NERUS
     Wh-why? Why would they do that?

  LANDRY
     We resort to force only when necessary.

  NERUS
     Oh I assure you it will be. It will be, General.
     And-and with the most powerful weapons in your
     arsenal.

  LANDRY
     I'll forward this new information directly to
     Prometheus. And, uh... (gestures at the table)
     I'll see if I can arrange for more chicken.

  ANNOTATION
     He claps Nerus on the shoulder and leaves. Nerus
     takes another drink of wine.

  NERUS
     Do!


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     Prometheus exits hyperspace and approaches
     Kellana. The force field is visible from orbit.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Marks is seated at a console. Pendergast sits in
     the captain's chair. Daniel, Mitchell, Carter and
     Vala stand behind them. In the background, Teal'c
     discusses something with another crew member, then
     approaches the others.

  MARKS
     Sir, we received an encrypted databurst from
     Stargate Command the moment we came out of
     hyperspace.

  PENDERGAST
     Decode it immediately. Are we picking up any other
     vessels in the system?

  MARKS
     Negative, sir.

  MITCHELL
     Can we get a closer look at the surface?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves forward and sits at a console on the
     other side of Pendergast's chair.

  CARTER
     You can already see the extent of the incursion
     with the naked eye.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala leans forward and looks at Marks's console.

  VALA
     (amazed) My god, it's enormous.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks intently at her. She stands up
     straight and meets his gaze.

  VALA
     (gesturing at console innocently) Not everything I
     say is innuendo.

  DANIEL
     (annoyed) We can all see, thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel grabs her by the shoulders and moves her
     away from the console.

  CARTER
     It's increased by almost 900% since our original
     intel.

  TEAL'C
     What of the Jaffa, Colonel Carter?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter presses a few buttons. She shakes her head
     and looks back at Teal'c.

  CARTER
     Sorry, Teal'c. I'm not detecting any life signs
     outside of the force field.

  MITCHELL
     (moving closer to her) Inside?

  CARTER
     Just one.

  MITCHELL
     The Prior.

  ANNOTATION
     Pendergast glances up at Mitchell in concern.

  CARTER
     I don't know how he's managing it. According to
     these readings, the atmosphere inside the field
     has become toxic. Probably as a result of the
     Jaffa weapons fire on the force field.

  PENDERGAST
     Send a subspace message to Stargate Command. We
     are over the enemy beachhead.


LOCATION--KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     It is dark inside the force field, but it is
     unclear whether it is because it is now night, or
     whether it is due to the force field or toxins
     within it. The area is illuminated by the glow of
     the active Stargate. An ankle-high fog covers the
     ground. The Prior stands several feet in front of
     the Stargate, holding his glowing staff and
     reading aloud to himself from The Book of Origin.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS GEAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Vala and Teal'c check space suits in preparation
     for use. Mitchell sits at a bench, reading some
     papers. In front of him is a long cylindrical
     device, the Mark IX weapon. Daniel walks in and
     sits next to Mitchell. Carter follows behind him.

  DANIEL
     You do realize that no matter how nicely we ask
     them, they're not all that likely to stop.

  VALA
     Then why are we going down there?

  DANIEL
     Well, you're going 'cause I'm going.

  MITCHELL
     And we're going because we have orders.

  VALA
     Thanks to Nerus. Doesn't that alarm anyone?

  CARTER
     Well, our government believes we need to send the
     Ori a message.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed. The Ori need to be made aware that they
     are not welcome.

  VALA
     (with a pointed look at Daniel) Well, some of you
     are certainly expert at getting that message
     across.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel turns and looks at Vala, annoyed. The door
     to the room opens and some crew members enter.

  PENDERGAST
     (over intercom) SG-1, this is the flight deck. My
     people are...


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  PENDERGAST
     (continuing) ...predicting an expansion phase to
     occur anytime in the next few minutes.

  CARTER
     (over intercom) Understood.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS GEAR ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel stands and moves to another flight suit.
     The crew members who just arrived are also double
     checking the suits. Carter moves closer to the
     Mark IX weapon. Mitchell stands up next to her.

  CARTER
     If Nerus is correct, we should be able to punch
     through with our transport beam.

  VALA
     And if not?

  MITCHELL
     Then we're all dressed up with nowhere to go.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala heaves a worried sigh.

  CARTER
     Your return window will be roughly sixteen seconds
     once on the surface. After which time, you'll be
     committed until the next expansion phase in about
     half an hour. I'll be monitoring from the bridge.

  MITCHELL
     Thanks. Let's do this.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Carter reach down to the weapon.

  CARTER
     Standby mode in three, two, one, mark.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Carter turn handles on the weapon
     simultaneously. A red bar light pulses in and out
     on the weapon's console.

  CARTER
     Good luck.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter leaves the room. Mitchell moves over to a
     flight suit. Teal'c climbs a small ladder to begin
     lowering himself into the space suit from behind
     it.


LOCATION--KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell, Teal'c, Daniel and Vala, in spacesuits,
     beam onto the surface near the DHD with the Mark
     IX weapon. Mitchell turns the handles on the
     weapon again and presses a button. A second bar
     light pulses in rhythm with the first on the
     console display.

  MITCHELL
     Set. Weapon is now in Mode Two. (into radio) We
     are go till the next window.

  ANNOTATION
     They notice the Prior reading near the Stargate
     and walk towards him.

  DANIEL
     How can he breathe?

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps he has a personal shield of some kind.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior continues to read until Mitchell speaks.

  MITCHELL
     Yo. My name is Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitch--

  PRIOR
     (interrupting) I know who you are.

  DANIEL
     Yeah, he just told you his name.

  PRIOR
     I also know you will do everything in your power
     to stop us.

  MITCHELL
     Obvious.

  PRIOR
     You will fail. The Ori are more powerful than you.
     We--

  MITCHELL
     (interrupting) Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
     blah. Here's the thing--we're not here to talk to
     you. We want to talk to the guys you take orders
     from.

  PRIOR
     The Ori are all-seeing.

  MITCHELL
     Great. In that case, we have in our possession a
     Mark IX naquadria enhanced nuclear warhead, which
     was designed solely for the purpose of vaporizing
     Stargates and anything else in a one-hundred mile
     radius. If you attempt to disable this warhead,
     physically, electronically, or otherwise, it will
     result in an immediate detonation. Now, we have a
     number of these god-awful things at our disposal,
     and we will not hesitate to use them if necessary.
     If you do not disengage the Stargate within thirty
     of our (makes quote mark motion with hands) "Earth
     minutes," we will shut down the gate for you.
     (turns to Daniel) Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     The Ori straightens and bristles while Mitchell
     speaks, but makes no other response. Daniel looks
     at Mitchell uncertainly. Mitchell gestures again
     for Daniel to talk.

  DANIEL
     Uh, we know who and what you are and want no part
     of what you have to offer. If you attempt this on
     any other planet in this galaxy, we will find you,
     and we will fight you.

  MITCHELL
     (after a slight pause) That's it?

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at the Prior for a moment before
     looking at Mitchell and nodding his head inside
     the helmet.

  MITCHELL
     I just gave them thirty minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     They all stare at each other awkwardly. A beeping
     sound is heard from the weapon.

  MITCHELL
     (glancing back at the weapon) Twenty-nine minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel makes a face and turns away from the Prior.
     The four huddle together. Daniel glances at
     Mitchell.

  DANIEL
     "Earth minutes"?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, I always wanted to say that.

  VALA
     Well, now you have.

  MITCHELL
     (making face at Vala) Hmph.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior returns to reading his book aloud to
     himself.

  MITCHELL
     I sure hope they shut down that gate before we
     have to set this thing off.

  TEAL'C
     That would appear to be highly unlikely, Colonel
     Mitchell.

  VALA
     I know. It's naive, even for you.

  MITCHELL
     Detonating the largest warhead ever built by man
     is not exactly the historical footnote that I had
     in mind.

  DANIEL
     Not to mention the guilt you're going to feel for
     vaporizing a perfectly good Stargate.

  MITCHELL
     (gesturing back at the Prior) And that guy.

  VALA
     Oh, he's probably looking forward to it.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, Prior. You understand that you are within a
     100 mile radius? And that personal shield ain't
     going to help you.

  PRIOR
     Death is only the beginning of the real journey.

  DANIEL
     Sounds familiar.

  PRIOR
     It should sound familiar, Dr. Jackson. When I die,
     I will ascend. It is the promise of the Ori.

  TEAL'C
     Even if you fail your task?

  ANNOTATION
     Sharp sounds and flashes of light suddenly appear
     randomly in the sky around them. They all look
     around in surprise.

  MITCHELL
     What the hell is that?

     Carter sits at the same console as earlier, next
     to Pendergast and Marks.

  PENDERGAST
     Lieutenant?

  MARKS
     There was no warning, sir. They started firing the
     second they came out of hyperspace.

  PENDERGAST
     Damn fortunate they're not firing at us. Open
     communications. (over radio) To Jaffa vessels,
     this is the Earth ship Prometheus. We request that
     you hold your fire. We have people down there.

  ANNOTATION
     Seen through the front window of the bridge, the
     three Ha'taks continue to fire at the force field.
     Carter looks very worried.

  PENDERGAST
     I repeat, SG-1 is on the planet, attempting to
     negotiate an Ori withdrawal. Cease fire now.


LOCATION--KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     Weapons fire continues to strike the force field.
     Mitchell, Teal'c, Daniel and Vala are standing
     near the DHD.

  TEAL'C
     The force field is being fired upon by Ha'tak
     vessels.

  DANIEL
     Why are they doing that?

  VALA
     Can we get them to stop doing that?

  MITCHELL
     (sighing) Oh, this could be bad. The Mark IX's
     fuse in Mode Two is a wee bit twitchy.

  VALA
     You mean it could go off?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell moves towards the Mark IX weapon.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter scans the monitor in front of her. She
     heaves a relieved sigh.

  CARTER
     They've stopped firing.

  ANNOTATION
     Pendergast glances at her screen and also takes a
     deep breath.

  MARKS
     Sir, the force field is entering an expansion
     phase ahead of the predicted time.

  PENDERGAST
     (flicking intercom switch) This is Pendergast. I
     want SG-1 brought back aboard as soon as we can
     beam them through the force field.


LOCATION--KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     The other three follow Mitchell to the weapon. The
     Prior remains near the Stargate.

  PENDERGAST
     (through radio) SG-1, prepare for immediate
     extraction.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell reaches and grabs a small device sitting
     on the Mark IX. In his gloved hand, he presses a
     large button on this device. Three bars of lights
     pulse at a rapid pace on the weapon's console.

  MITCHELL
     The weapon is now in Mode One. (in radio)
     Prometheus, we are ready for beam up. (turning to
     Prior) Prior, last chance.

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior pointedly turns his back on the four and
     faces the Stargate. Mitchell rolls his eyes and
     exchanges looks with Daniel, who shrugs. The four
     are beamed off the planet.

     Carter approaches the foreground of a
     communications viewscreen. The rest of the bridge,
     including Pendergast and Marks is visible behind
     her.

  CARTER
     It's an honor to speak with you, sir. My name is
     Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

  GERAK
     (interrupting) By insisting that we cease fire on
     the enemy stronghold, you've allowed it to expand
     even further, and we've lost the element of
     surprise.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  CARTER
     (glancing back at Pendergast) And quite possibly
     saved the lives of SG-1.

  ANNOTATION
     The ships and large blue force field are visible
     through the windows of the bridge. Above the
     windows are three small monitors. In the center
     monitor, Gerak's video transmission is visible.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) I ask you again. Why have you
     come to this world?

  CARTER
     We have reason to believe that the Ori are
     attempting to use this planet to stage a full
     scale invasion.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Daniel, Mitchell, and Vala, out of their
     space suits, enter the bridge. Teal'c stands next
     to Carter. Mitchell, Vala, and Daniel stand behind
     Pendergast's chair.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) And you hope to repel this
     invasion with words? There is more to this.

  TEAL'C
     Words are often the most powerful weapon of all,
     Gerak. The old ways will not stop an adversary as
     powerful as the Ori.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) So you said in your message
     to the High Council, Teal'c.

  TEAL'C
     (angrily) To which we received no response.

  CARTER
     We had no choice but to act on the information we
     had.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) And how is it that the Tau'ri
     received this information even before the Council?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter pause, uncertain how to respond.
     Teal'c opens his mouth to speak when Daniel
     interjects.

  DANIEL
     Uh...how we got this information is not important.
     What is important is that we stand together as
     allies in the face of our common enemy.

     We're sending the Ori a message which they should
     receive in about... (checks watch) ten seconds.

  PENDERGAST
     Shields to maximum. Gerak, I suggest you give the
     same order aboard your ships. There will be a
     blast wave.

  ANNOTATION
     A klaxon alarm starts to blare. Carter returns to
     her seat. Mitchell continues looking at his watch
     and moves behind her chair. Teal'c moves beside
     Marks's chair.

LOCATION--KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     The Prior stares into the event horizon while
     continuing to touch the ring. The Mark IX weapon
     whines louder. The bars are pulsing at an
     extremely rapid pace. There is a flash of white
     light as the weapon goes off.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     A red circle can be seen within the center of the
     blue force field. It rapidly expands. The diameter
     of the blue force field in turn becomes larger,
     expanding further around the planet.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks out the window in puzzlement, then
     turns to her console screens. A screen depicts
     Kellana and labels the gate's location in the
     center of a red circle. The edge of the red circle
     is labeled as the Mark IX's radius. The larger
     blue circle is also visible, but unlabeled. Below
     this image, a blinking caption reads "Force Field
     Expanding."

  MARKS
     Sir, the force field went into another expansion
     phase just as the bomb detonated...and it's a big
     one.

  ANNOTATION
     Pendergast sighs deeply.

LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     The red glow from the Mark IX explosion fades into
     a yellow light. The blue force field rapidly
     spreads around the planet.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  TEAL'C
     (looking at monitor) The force field continues to
     expand.

  VALA
     (low, to Daniel) It isn't supposed to be doing
     that, is it?

  DANIEL
     (worried) No.

  VALA
     (worried) Why is it doing that?

  DANIEL
     I don't know.

  VALA
     What are you going to do abou--?

  DANIEL
     (through gritted teeth) Vala, shut up.

  CARTER
     (staring at console) That was a multi-gigaton
     detonation. There's just no way.

  DANIEL
     Maybe the gate was destroyed.

  MITCHELL
     No. If the field is still expanding, the gate
     still has to be active.

  CARTER
     The environment inside the field has been turned
     into superheated plasma. Makes it impossible to
     get a reliable reading.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the monitors switches from graphs to a
     visual communication feed from Gerak's ship.
     Gerak's face fills the screen.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) And this is your message to
     the Ori?

  VALA
     Pithy, wasn't it?

  TEAL'C
     (with sidelong look at Vala) We struck the enemy
     with our most powerful weapon.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) And yet, their force field
     grows.

  TEAL'C
     That was not our intention.

  GERAK
     Their beachhead must be destroyed. If you are
     truly our ally, you will join us in this attack.
     If you do not, your ship will become our next
     target.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c, Carter, and Pendergast appear visibly
     upset at this ultimatum.

     center of the force field on Kellana.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  PENDERGAST
     The detonation did weaken the force field. Our
     combined weapons fire might just finish the job.

  TEAL'C
     If it does not, we will soon be engaged in battle
     with Gerak's forces.

  DANIEL
     Sam?

  CARTER
     (shaking her head) We just don't have enough
     information. Until I can explain how they're
     keeping the gate open or powering a force field
     this large...It's your call.

  VALA
     (raising hand) I say we run away and rethink the
     whole thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell glares at Vala. He bites his lip and
     moves in front of Carter's console, thinking.

  MITCHELL
     Open up with everything we've got.

  PENDERGAST
     Bring main rail gun on line and commence firing.
     Launch missiles.

  ANNOTATION

     klaxon wails.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     The Prometheus launches missiles and joins the
     Ha'tak vessels in firing at the force field.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     A console monitor shows the gate's location. A
     dotted line attempts to indicate the force field
     boundary, which is still expanding, moving beyond
     what can be displayed on screen. A flashing
     caption reads "Currently Expanding." Another
     flashing caption reads "Visible Hemisphere encased
     in Force Field. STRENGTH DECREASING."

  PENDERGAST
     Is the fire having any effect?

  MARKS
     The force field is definitely losing strength.

  CARTER
     But it's still expanding at a faster rate than
     it's weakening.

  DANIEL
     It's almost enveloped the entire planet. What
     happens then?

  CARTER
     (in sudden realization) Dammit.

  VALA
     (to Carter) What?

  DANIEL
     (also to Carter) What?

  CARTER
     (to Mitchell) Colonel, we need to cease fire, now!

  MITCHELL
     (turns to Pendergast)

  NOW!


  PENDERGAST
     Do it!

  ANNOTATION
     Marks hits buttons on his console.

  CARTER
     The greater the intensity of our weapons' fire,
     the greater and more frequent their expansion
     phases. There is a direct correlation. They're
     using the energy of our own weapons to build their
     beachhead.

  VALA
     You mean they planned this?

  CARTER
     There's no way to project the necessary power
     through a Stargate across galaxies. So they
     designed a force field that could be powered by
     our own weapons.

  TEAL'C
     The Ori knew the Jaffa of Kellana would defend
     their homeworld and others would follow.

  DANIEL
     (angry) And Nerus made certain we'd join in.

  MITCHELL
     (nodding and angry) Which means he's working for
     the Ori.

  CARTER
     (angry) The Mark IX gave them almost 70% of the
     power they needed to envelop the entire planet.

  MITCHELL
     Oh yeah, we've been set up.

  VALA
     (sarcastically) What a complete shock!

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell and Daniel glare at her. Vala makes a
     zipping gesture with her hand and ducks her head.

  VALA
     Won't say another word.

  TEAL'C
     Gerak's forces must also cease fire.

  PENDERGAST

  ANNOTATION
     The still active Stargate lies flat on the ground,
     braced by a few rocks and surrounded by molten
     lava. Through the event horizon, three oblong
     objects, barely fitting through the Stargate, fly
     out, heading towards space.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter's console shows a radar screen. Three small
     dots appear on the outer edge.

  CARTER
     We've got incoming. Three objects and counting,
     bearing one-eight-zero, rising from the planet's
     surface from the coordinates of the Stargate and
     accelerating.

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell moves around the console to also see.

  PENDERGAST
     Shields to maximum.

  ANNOTATION
     Marks presses some buttons on his console. An
     angry Gerak appears on a viewscreen.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) Why have you ceased fire?

  TEAL'C
     We have reason to believe our weapons may power
     the enemy force field.

  GERAK
     (through viewscreen) Impossible.

  CARTER
     That's what I thought, but it's the only
     explanation.

  DANIEL
     (frustrated) Gerak, they used both of us.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm is heard on Gerak's ship. The
     communication cuts off. The Prometheus sensor
     screen shows multiple targets moving quickly.

  MARKS
     Multiple contacts on multiple bearings, sir.

  MITCHELL
     (leaning close to Carter) What the hell are they?

  CARTER
     They're about ten meters long, but sensors read no
     internal space, no life signs aboard.

  PENDERGAST

     launch fighters.

  ANNOTATION
     Marks presses buttons on his console. The console
     screen shows several objects approaching. One is
     flashing red on the screen very close to the
     center. An alarm wails and a red caption reads

     Several objects collide with one of the Ha'taks.
     It explodes. The Prometheus slowly backs away from

     Nerus makes a face.

  NERUS
     Oooh. They say all good meals must come to an end.
     I assume, General, that by now, SG-1 has reported
     that the Ori, the closest thing to true gods in
     the entire universe, have successfully established
     a permanent foothold.

  LANDRY
     What did you do?

  NERUS
     Oh, it's not what I did, General. What I have done
     pales in comparison to your contribution. And by
     now, the force field has almost entirely enveloped
     the planet, which makes them unstoppable. (Nerus
     grins wickedly and his voice changes to the
     Goa'uld echo) And we couldn't have done it without
     you.

  CARTER
     We've got the sensors back up, but we're gonna
     have to get closer to the planet to find out.

  PENDERGAST
     All right, bring us about. Take us back into the
     system.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter reads her console monitor, which is
     displaying Kellana with various information. On
     the screen there is a dotted line graphically
     surrounding the planet, and another blinking
     dotted line tracing the edge of the planet itself.

  CARTER
     Okay, I've got a fix on the planet. Looks like
     Gerak was right. According to the sensors, its
     diameter has decreased by 16%.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel looks at Carter in surprise.

  VALA
     (muttering to herself) Planets don't shrink in my
     experience.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter changes the display on her monitor. The
     information about the planet's diameter
     disappears, as does the graphical representation
     of Kellana on the screen. In its place is a long
     line of oblong objects diagonally crossing the
     screen.

  CARTER
     Oh, there's something else.

  ANNOTATION
     The console image zooms out to show breaks in the
     line and a second line of objects behind the
     first. To the right is graphical representation
     showing the edge of the planet. More objects are
     moving around, fitting into the missing spots in
     the lines. As the image continues to zoom out, the
     two lines appear to form an incomplete circle
     viewed from its side.

  MITCHELL
     (staring at the console) What is that?

  DANIEL
     (also looking at Carter's console) A ship?

  CARTER
     It's hard to say. Whatever it is, I think it's
     composed of the objects that came through the
     Stargate.

     Teal'c moves forward and stands beside Mitchell to
     look at the monitor.


LOCATION--SPACE ABOVE KELLANA

  ANNOTATION
     Prometheus approaches Kellana. As it nears, the
     object on the console becomes clear. It is a large
     incomplete ring that is rotating; eventually the
     center is facing Prometheus. The objects that flew
     out of the Stargate are entering the missing
     sections and becoming part of the ring. Each
     section glows with blue lights.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, it does.

  CARTER
     In fact, I think that's just what it is.

  DANIEL
     (drawing out the words) No, it can't be, because I
     was going to say "Stargate".

  CARTER
     Try "Supergate". I estimate it's three- to
     four-hundred meters across.

  TEAL'C
     Large enough for the passage of an entire armada.

     Vala crosses to stand behind Marks' console and
     look at the information.

  VALA
     It's incomplete; there's still time.

  DANIEL
     Time? Time to do what? Everything we've done has
     just made things worse.

  ANNOTATION
     On Marks's console monitor, a graphical
     representation of Kellana is surrounded by a
     dotted lines with various captions. A second
     circular dotted line replaces the spot where the
     edge of the planet was on the screen, and the
     image of Kellana itself becomes smaller.

  MARKS
     The planet's diameter has now decreased by up to
     50%, and it's accelerating rapidly.

  CARTER
     I think I know why. Only one thing in the universe
     could power a gate that size. It's also the only
     thing that could allow them to keep the gate open
     this long, and there's one on the other end.

  DANIEL
     (face falling in comprehension) A black hole.

  CARTER
     That's what the force field was for. It wasn't
     meant to keep us out. It was designed to collapse
     the planet into a micro-singularity.

  MITCHELL
     Why?

  CARTER
     Well, this is how they can create a wormhole that
     can span such a vast distance. With a black hole
     at either end, they can maintain an open wormhole
     indefinitely.

  MITCHELL
     Fine, fine. How do we stop them?

  VALA
     I have an idea. If we can...

  DANIEL
     (oblivious to Vala) The next idea anybody comes up
     with has to be outside the box.

  ANNOTATION
     Vala glares at Daniel, but no one notices her.

  CARTER
     Okay, the gate is composed of individual units.
     The-There must be some sort of energy linkage
     between them, like a-like a chain.

  VALA
     (trying to break in) Exactly, so we...

  MITCHELL
     (oblivious to Vala) So we need a big ol' set of

LOCATION--PROMETHEUS BRIDGE

  ANNOTATION
     The crew cheers loudly.

  CARTER
     She did it! The gate's been destroyed.

  DANIEL
     (concerned) Did Vala make it back on board?

  MARKS
     Negative, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel sighs and looks upset. An instant later, he
     stumbles backward, holding onto Pendergast's
     chair. Mitchell hurries to his side.

  MITCHELL
     (worried) Jackson?!? Infirmary.

  ANNOTATION
     Pendergast starts to get up to help, but Mitchell
     and Teal'c each grab Daniel by his upper arms and
     lead him off the bridge.

  CARTER
     (standing up) Get a message to Stargate Command.
     The Ori beachhead has been destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter runs after Daniel and the others.


LOCATION--SGC BRIG

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus is shackled, handcuffs connected to a chain
     around his waist. He sits in a chair. The door to
     the room opens, and Landry enters with three
     guards, who take up positions around the room.

  NERUS
     (speaking in a normal, if arrogant, voice) There's
     still time to repent, General. The Ori are
     forgiving.

  LANDRY
     That won't be necessary. SG-1 has destroyed the
     Ori beachhead.

  NERUS
     (chuckling) You're lying.

  LANDRY
     I'm not.

  NERUS
     I've witnessed their power, General. Power that
     will one day be mine. And if what you say is true,
     you've merely forestalled the inevitable. (a
     rapturous expression appears on his face, and he
     stands) And...when you...put me to death...for
     what I have done...I shall ascend.

  LANDRY
     (moving uncomfortably close to Nerus) You will
     Descend, to a small, dark room, in the basement of
     Area 51, and you'll stay there until you come up
     with a defense against the Ori. That was our deal.

  NERUS
     (shaking his head in amused disbelief) What would
     possibly compel me to do that?

  LANDRY
     Hunger.

  ANNOTATION
     Nerus looks at Landry and gulps in shock. Landry
     walks out of the room, followed by the guards, who
     shut and lock the door. As the full import of
     Landry's words sinks in, Nerus gulps again.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c strides down a corridor. Behind him
     Mitchell and Carter walk side by side.

  MITCHELL
     (to Carter) You know, these Ori are just going to
     try it again.

  CARTER
     Probably.

  MITCHELL
     I'm saying we could sure use someone like you on
     the front line. Just think about it.


LOCATION--PROMETHEUS INFIRMARY

  ANNOTATION
     A doctor moves away from Daniel's hospital bed,
     the head of which is raised. Teal'c, Mitchell and
     Carter approach.

  MITCHELL
     Hey, Jackson.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel groggily opens his eyes.

  DANIEL
     (hoarsely) Sorry. Keep falling asleep.

  MITCHELL
     Well, it's better than the alternative.

  CARTER
     You're lucky the bracelet's effect was wearing
     off.

  DANIEL
     (in a low, flat voice) Yep, lucky me.

  TEAL'C
     (with a kind smile) Vala Mal Doran will be
     mourned.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel leans his head back farther into the pillow
     and turns away slightly.

  CARTER
     I've been going over the telemetry from the last
     few seconds before the formation of the
     singularity. A matter stream left the cargo ship
     just before it exploded.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniel lifts his head from the pillow and looks at
     Carter with interest. Teal'c turns to her and
     blinks.

  CARTER
     There's at least a slight chance she was pulled
     into the singularity.

  DANIEL
     So you're saying she could be alive, somewhere in
     Ori home galaxy?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell contemplates this idea.

  CARTER
     (nodding) It's possible.

  DANIEL
     (his expression clearing slightly) Well...we
     wanted to send them a message.

  ANNOTATION
     All four exchange bemused expressions at this
     possibility.
