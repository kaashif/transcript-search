LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     A small cargo ship is flying through space.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is at the controls, with Carter in the
     co-pilot's seat and Teal'c and Jonas standing
     behind them. Two other personnel can be seen at
     the very rear.

  JACOB
     Looks like your analysis was right, Sam. It's dead
     in space, but completely intact.

  CARTER
     Has Anubis ever done anything like this before?

  JACOB
     This is a first. It must have been a little crazy
     around the SGC when it showed up, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob grins.

  CARTER
     You have no idea!

  JACOB
     I have a pretty good idea, Sam. I used to be an
     Air Force General, remember?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill appears from the rear, stretching.

  O'NEILL
     Are we there yet?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter look back at O'Neill at he
     stretches.

  O'NEILL
     Sorry.

  CARTER
     Not yet, Sir. Just close enough to do some scans.

  O'NEILL
     Scanned anything yet?

  CARTER
     Nothing, Sir.

  O'NEILL
     Nothing?

  CARTER
     It's in a stable planetary orbit. Shields and
     weapons are down, and it's emitting no EM of any
     kind.

  O'NEILL
     Still just, kind of, sitting there.

  CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill looks puzzled and bored, Jonas smiles,
     a look of wonder on his face.

  JACOB
     Well, if they were gonna attack Earth, they would
     have done it by now.

  O'NEILL
     (to Jonas) What are you smiling at?

  JONAS
     Well, it's just that it's my first time. In space.

  O'NEILL
     Ah...

  JONAS
     We'd only begun to consider the possibility of
     space travel. To actually be out here is...It's
     amazing.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks unimpressed as Teal'c smiles.

  TEAL'C
     Indeed.

  O'NEILL
     Until something goes...horribly wrong.

  ANNOTATION
     Major Davis and Doctor Friesen walk up to the
     team.

  DAVIS
     What's our status?

  CARTER
     The ship should be just a few hundred kilometers
     dead ahead. There.

  O'NEILL
     Ship Ahoy-hoy...

  ANNOTATION
     The cargo ship comes to a stop ahead of a large
     Goa'uld mothership. Jonas looks out of the window,
     smiling and awed.

  JONAS
     That's incredible!

  CARTER
     I'm not a hundred percent but...this could be the
     same ship Anubis used to kidnap Thor.

  JACOB
     Now we know why they haven't attacked. There's no
     discernible life signs.

  CARTER
     All the escape pods have been jettisoned.

  TEAL'C
     This ship does not appear to have been damaged in
     battle.

  JACOB
     Power and life supports are functioning normally.
     There's just nobody on board.

  JONAS
     Why would they abandon a perfectly good ship?

  JACOB
     They wouldn't.


LOCATION--SPACE

  ANNOTATION
     The mothership and the smaller cargo ship are in
     Earth's orbit.

  JACOB
     Jack. Rather than fly into a cargo bay, I
     recommend we use the transport rings to get us
     there until we get a better idea of what's going
     on.

  O'NEILL
     (to Jacob) Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns to Davis and Friesen and indicates
     that they should leave the cockpit.

  O'NEILL
     Boys...

  O'NEILL
     (to Teal'c) Radio Hammond. Let him know we'll have
     something in a couple of hours.

  TEAL'C
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill starts to leave.

  O'NEILL
     Jonas, stay with Teal'c.

  JONAS
     I don't understand.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill turns around and walks towards Jonas.

  O'NEILL
     I'm sorry. Stay here.

  JONAS
     So I'm not going with you?

  O'NEILL
     Not this time.

  JONAS
     Colonel, I've studied every report, every
     specification, everything you have on Goa'uld
     motherships...

  O'NEILL
     Because I gave you an order, Jonas. I always have
     a reason I'm not required to explain. It's a
     military thing.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas watches as O'Neill walks towards the others,
     who are preparing to leave the ship.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Jacob, Carter, Davis and Friesen ring
     into the corridor. They walk through a doorway.
     Jacob whispers to O'Neill as he indicates a
     direction.

  JACOB
     Jack!

  ANNOTATION
     As they follow Jacob, a garbled computerised sound
     is heard over the intercom.

  DAVIS
     What is that?

  JACOB
     I can't make it out.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas sits in the co-pilot seat as Teal'c, sitting
     in the pilot's seat, checks the instruments.

  TEAL'C
     The crew appears to have abandoned ship,
     GeneralHammond.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  HAMMOND
     That's good news! I don't mind telling you, we've
     all been holding our breath down here.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  TEAL'C
     That is most unwise.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond and smile.

  HAMMOND
     Yes, of course, Teal'c.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  TEAL'C
     Colonel O'Neill is leading a team to determine if
     the vessel can be salvaged.


LOCATION--SGC CONTROL ROOM

  HAMMOND
     Very well. Keep me apprised. Hammond out.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas smiles goofily at Teal'c, who gives him a
     sidelong look.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob leads the others into Anubis' throne-room,
     where Thor had been held captive. Jacob activates
     a control panel.

  JACOB
     Well, this is strange. The ship is operational,
     but before they left, they initiated a self
     destruct sequence.

  CARTER
     It looks like the countdown's stuck.

  JACOB
     It just doesn't make any sense. The only way to
     stop a self destruct is with a command override,
     but that would completely erase the sequence, not
     suspend it halfway.

  FRIESEN
     So, is the ship gonna explode or not?

  JACOB
     Well, until we know why the countdown was
     suspended, we can't be sure it won't start up
     again. We need to get to the computer core and do
     a diagnostic.

  O'NEILL
     Carter. You and Davis. See if you can disable that
     self destruct altogether.

  CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

  DAVIS
     Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Davis leave as O'Neill sits on Anubis'
     throne.

  JACOB
     Jack, are you seriously considering salvaging this
     ship?

  O'NEILL
     Why, yes, I am, Jacob.

  JACOB
     This ship belonged to Anubis.

  O'NEILL
     Excellent!

  JACOB
     What if it's some sort of Trojan Horse?

  O'NEILL
     Well, then, apparently, they did it wrong.

  JACOB
     Look, Jack. None of this makes any sense, so
     before you go slapping a US Air Force sticker on
     the side of this ship...

  O'NEILL
     Oh, will you stop? Obviously we gotta check things
     out around here, to see what happened before we do
     anything.

  JACOB
     And find out what the hell it's doing in Earth
     orbit.

  O'NEILL
     But our standing orders are to recover technology
     that can help us defend against the Goa'uld. I'd
     say this ship falls under that heading , wouldn't
     you?

  JACOB
     Okay.

  O'NEILL
     Thank you.

  JACOB
     You know, sometimes I get a little concerned that
     you're gonna get my favorite planet wiped out.

  O'NEILL
     Yes. What planet is that?

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob looks unimpressed at O'Neill's sarcasm.
     O'Neill grimaces.

  JACOB
     So listen, if they wanted to scuttle this ship,
     and the self-destruct didn't work, their next
     logical option would be to sabotage the
     hyperdrive.

  O'NEILL
     Friesen. Let's go.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill rises and heads out of the room.

  JACOB
     I'll do a system's check from here.

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill and Friesen leave, the garbled
     computerized voice is heard again over the
     intercom.

  O'NEILL
     Find out what that sound is.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Davis head down the corridor until they
     reach a doorway. Carter enters a code on the pad
     to the side of the door, which does not open.

  DAVIS
     What's the problem?

  ANNOTATION
     Carter shakes her head, and enters the code again.
     Again, the door stays closed.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Dad, this is Sam.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) What's up?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  CARTER
     We're on our way to the computer core, but we
     can't access this corridor.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) All right, hang on.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob brings up an image of the ship's schematics.

  JACOB
     (Into radio) The whole section's been sealed off,
     and the life support's been shut down.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Why would they do that?

  JACOB
     (Over radio) I have no idea.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     I'll see if I can open it up and get the
     ventilation going again.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Friesen are walking down the corridor,
     Friesen checking papers attached to a clipboard.

  FRIESEN
     Colonel, we should also check on the shield
     generators. O'NEILL (Into radio) Jacob.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) How's the hyperdrive?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Well, Friesen says the engine checks
     out, but he wants to have a look at the shield
     generators.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) Did he say why?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill looks at Friesen questioningly.

  FRIESEN
     Why? To see them.

  O'NEILL
     To see them? (Into radio) Never mind.

  FRIESEN
     If this was the ship that destroyed an Asgard
     ship, and kidnapped Thor, then its shields were
     clearly superior to any...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks away as Friesen talks.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     As Carter and Davis stand at the doorway, the door
     suddenly opens.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) We're in!

  JACOB
     (Over radio) All right, just be careful, Sam.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Davis enter the next corridor.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Yes, Dad.

  ANNOTATION
     The next closed door has a number of weapons fire
     burns.

  DAVIS
     Whoa!

  ANNOTATION
     Davis walks up to investigate the damage.

  DAVIS
     Something bad definitely happened here!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter nods agreement as Davis enters a code on
     the door panel. The door remains closed.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Dad, we're just outside the computer
     core. The door looks like it's been hit by several
     staff blasts.

  JACOB
     (over radio) That's interesting, because it's the
     only door I can't open.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is again checking the ship schematics.

  JACOB
     (Into radio) The circuits are fused. It's almost
     as if there was a deliberate overload.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  CARTER
     (Into radio) It's starting to look more and more
     like a saboteur on board. Someone damaged the
     computer, and then sealed it off so they couldn't
     effect repairs.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) Whatever happened...I can't get you
     inside.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Colonel? Have you been monitoring?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Affirmative. On my way.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill stops and turns to Friesen.

  O'NEILL
     I have to go blow something up. Head on back to
     the pel'tac, see if Jacob needs any help.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill heads down one corridor, Friesen goes in a
     different direction. Friesen then turns back,
     checks that O'Neill is nowhere to be seen and
     heads in the original direction that the two had
     been travelling.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill attaches a C4 charge to the door as Carter
     and Davis look on.

  O'NEILL
     Shall we?

  ANNOTATION
     The three take cover as O'Neill detonates the
     charge.

  DAVIS
     WOO! That was loud!

  O'NEILL
     (loudly) What?

  ANNOTATION
     The explosion has destroyed the door, and Carter,
     Davis and O'Neill step through.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Jacob, we're in.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter activates a mechanism which opens a cover,
     to reveal a futuristic machine. Davis looks at the
     machine.

  DAVIS
     This is fantastic!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill walks over to a bank of viewscreens.

  O'NEILL
     No, this is fantastic.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Friesen is walking down the corridor, reading the
     papers on his clipboard.

  FRIESEN
     Shield generators...

  ANNOTATION
     He turns into a room, glowing with green light. He
     hears a footstep.

  FRIESEN
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     He walks toward the sound, there is also a blue
     light effect coming from the same direction.

  FRIESEN
     Colonel O'Neill?

  ANNOTATION
     As he turns towards one of the corridors, he is
     faced with three Ninja Jaffa. The lead Jaffa
     brandishes a sword, while the other two are armed
     with staff weapons.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Jonas are in the cargo ship, Jonas
     slumped in his seat, looking bored. He removes a
     banana from his pocket. Teal'c looks across at
     Jonas as he begins peeling the banana.

  JONAS
     Why would he bring me all the way out here, if I'm
     not gonna be allowed to contribute anything?

  TEAL'C
     This is your first mission. It may take some time
     for Colonel O'Neill to gain confidence in your
     abilities.

  JONAS
     So it was the same for you?

  TEAL'C
     No, it was not.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas looks across at Teal'c, surprised.

  JONAS
     Oh. You know I heard a rumor that uhh...I only got
     this assignment because Colonel O'Neill didn't
     want to have a Russian on the team.

  TEAL'C
     Such rumors are meaningless.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas takes a bite of the banana.

  TEAL'C
     O'Neill would not have chosen you if he did not
     believe that one day you would be an effective
     member of SG-1.

  JONAS
     Thanks, Teal'c! I really appreciate that.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c stares out of the viewscreen.

  JONAS
     I mean, those of us who are not originally from
     the planet Earth...gotta stick together, right?

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c turns quickly to face Jonas, a forbidding
     look on his face.

  TEAL'C
     Are you suggesting an alien conspiracy?

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas, still eating the banana, shrugs, surprised.

  JONAS
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c continues to stare at Jonas.

  JONAS
     Oho...

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas laughs nervously.

  JONAS
     Of course, yes. I...I was warned about your
     occasional use of humor. It's...

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas laughs.

  JONAS
     Got me!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c is still staring at Jonas, unsmiling. Jonas
     looks across, notices Teal'c's seriousness, and
     stops smiling.

  JONAS
     No conspiracy!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c turns away from Jonas.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is kneeling on the floor, working on a
     laptop computer.

  CARTER
     The computer log confirms that this is the same
     ship that Thor was aboard.

  ANNOTATION
     Davis is working on the computer core as O'Neill
     stands apart, looking on.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  CARTER
     Well, it could explain a lot, Sir. Thor's brain
     was directly linked to this computer. Anubis may
     have grossly underestimated the power of an
     Asgard's mind.

  O'NEILL
     And?

  CARTER
     It's possible that when his mind was linked, Thor
     was able to rewrite some of the ship's
     programming. Maybe even leave something behind.

  ANNOTATION
     Davis looks up.

  DAVIS
     Like a virus?

  CARTER
     Exactly. By interfering with everything from
     navigation to life support, a complex virus could
     have driven Anubis to abandon ship.

  O'NEILL
     Might explain why the self-destruct got stuck.

  CARTER
     He could have generated a whole new subroutine
     that sent the ship to our Solar System after it
     was abandoned. Like a...a gift! I know it sounds a
     little wacky, Sir, but the more I think about it,
     the more it seems like the most reasonable
     explanation.

  DAVIS
     There's a little wishful thinking there, Major.

  CARTER
     Well, if this ship wasn't ultimately intended for
     us to find, why did it travel half way across the
     galaxy all by itself? For that matter, why didn't
     the self destruct just go off?

  DAVIS
     Well, even if you're right, I mean, I really doubt
     that a virus is gonna know the difference between
     us and the Goa'uld.

  CARTER
     There has to be a way to disable it somehow or
     Thor wouldn't have sent the ship here. (Into
     radio) Dr. Friesen, this is Major Carter. We could
     use your assistance in the computer core.

  ANNOTATION
     Getting no answer, O'Neill rolls his eyes.

  O'NEILL
     Friesen, come in!

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Dad, have you seen Doctor Friesen?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) Negative.

     O'Neill grimaces and smiles at Carter.

  O'NEILL
     You scientists. Stay here, I'll find him.

  CARTER
     It's a big ship, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill heads for the doorway.

  O'NEILL
     I think I know where he went.

  ANNOTATION
     Both Davis and Carter kneel next to the computer
     core. As the garbled computerised voice again
     comes over the intercom, Davis stands and looks
     around.

  DAVIS
     It's coming out of the ship's intercom.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks puzzled.

  CARTER
     What is?

  DAVIS
     The sound we keep hearing. You hear that? It's
     a...there's...there's a pattern to it, almost like
     distorted words.

  CARTER
     Let's check it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Davis again joins Carter at the computer core.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP ANOTHER CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     As O'Neill walks towards the room housing the
     shield generators, he slows down and checks the
     adjoining corridor. As he turns the corner into
     the room, he sees Friesen's body on the floor. He
     checks Friesen's pulse.

  O'NEILL
     (Quietly into radio) Carter. I want you and Davis
     back in the pel'tak with Jacob.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP COMPUTER CORE

     (Into radio) Jacob, come in.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     A staff blast suddenly hits Jacob in the back, and
     he topples to the ground, unconscious. Two of the
     Ninja Jaffa are standing in the doorway, one
     having just shot Jacob. They make their way to the
     control panel.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP GENERATOR ROOM

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Jacob, do you read?

  ANNOTATION
     One of the Jaffa works at the control panel, and
     appears to activate something. The leave the room,
     with Jacob still lying unconscious on the floor.

  O'NEILL
     (Over radio) Jacob, come in. Jacob?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill carefully walks along the corridor,
     checking around corners. As he turns down another
     corridor, he runs into Carter and Davis. Carter
     has her gun raised towards him, but lowers it as
     she sees that it's O'Neill. O'Neill motions for
     Carter and Davis to follow him along the corridor.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Davis enter, immediately
     seeing Jacob lying on the floor. O'Neill motions
     Carter towards Jacob.

  CARTER
     Dad!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Davis go to Jacob while O'Neill checks
     out the rest of the room. Carter helps Jacob to
     his feet, while Davis stands, noticing something
     out of the viewscreen. He moves to the control
     panel.

  DAVIS
     Colonel, we've got another problem.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob is standing, though obviously in pain. He
     waves Carter away.

  JACOB
     I'll live. Go, go, go.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter joins Davis at the control panel.

  CARTER
     We're decelerating out of orbit and they've
     disabled the drive controls. Sir, we've got no way
     of altering course. We're going to crash.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Teal'c, come in.

     You're gonna haveta ring us outta here.


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods at Jonas.

  TEAL'C
     (Into radio) Standing by.

  ANNOTATION
     Both Teal'c and Jonas rise and head to the ring
     room. As Jonas gets there, the rings are
     activated. He turns his back on the rings, but
     turns round in time to see the three Ninja Jaffa
     who have ringed onto the ship. He gasps and is
     grabbed from behind by Teal'c, who pulls him
     behind a wall. The Jaffa shoot the ring control
     panel. Teal'c zats one of the Jaffa and moves to
     the opposite side of the doorway. He zats another
     Jaffa but the third leader makes it to the
     doorway. Teal'c grabs the staff weapon from him,
     hits him with the zat then fires the zat. Jonas
     appears in the doorway and activates his zat.
     Teal'c collects the staff weapons dropped by the
     Jaffa. Jonas lowers his weapon and sighs.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  CARTER
     It's no use. I estimate impact between five
     hundred and a thousand miles west south west of
     Alaska.

  DAVIS
     The amount of energy released at impact would be
     massive. There could be a tidal wave.

  JACOB
     Raise the shields, set inertial dampening to
     maximum. That way the ship should survive in one
     piece.

  CARTER
     Done. That's all I can do.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Teal'c, we're heading into the ring
     room.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill heads for the doorway as Carter helps
     Jacob.

  O'NEILL
     Wait, wait, wait.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill gestures for the others to stop.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Teal'c?


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  TEAL'C
     (Into radio) O'Neill, we have been attacked by
     Jaffa from the mothership.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob, held up by Carter, Carter and O'Neill
     grimace.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) What's your situation?


LOCATION--CARGO SHIP

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks back to Jonas who is standing in the
     ring room doorway.

  TEAL'C
     They are no longer a threat to us, but the ship
     has been damaged.

  ANNOTATION
     The ring room control panel is damaged and
     smoking.

  TEAL'C
     The crystals that allow us to receive ring
     transmissions have been destroyed and there is
     insufficient time to dock aboard the mothership.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, Davis and Jacob turn to the
     viewscreen, where the planet is obviously nearing.

  O'NEILL
     Well, I guess we're going in.


LOCATION--SGC BRIEFING ROOM--NIGHTTIME

  ANNOTATION
     A monitor shows the mothership's course into the
     ocean.

  HAMMOND
     The official line is that early this morning,
     (He's on the phone) at approximately 0800 hours,
     NORAD tracked a meteor as it entered the Earth's
     atmosphere, and landed somewhere in the North
     Pacific.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond is talking on the phone. The Briefing Room
     is full of computers and personnel. Walter Davis
     is manning one of the computers.

  HAMMOND
     So far, no word from the Chinese government, but
     I'm sure we'll be hearing from them soon enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Jonas enter. Hammond acknowledges them
     with a nod.

  HAMMOND
     As for the Russians, I have a call going through
     to Colonel Chekov in about 10 minutes...Yes, Sir.
     I'll be keeping you apprised of any further
     developments.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond hangs up the phone and turns to Teal'c and
     Jonas. Teal'c has walked over to a large-screen
     display of the mothership.

  HAMMOND
     Gentlemen! It's good to have you back. We've
     located the mothership. Sonar readings suggest
     that it's still intact.

  JONAS
     Then they may still be alive.

  HAMMOND
     We're proceeding under that assumption.

  ANNOTATION
     Hammond hands a report to Jonas.

  HAMMOND
     There's a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle on route
     from Pearl Harbor. But we still have to figure out
     how the crew's going to access the mothership.

  TEAL'C
     A mothership's escape pods are jettisoned through
     pressurized tubes. It may be possible that one of
     them could be used as a point of access.

  HAMMOND
     That sounds like our best shot.

  JONAS
     General, with your permission, Teal'c and I would
     like to join the rescue operation.

  HAMMOND
     There's a plane waiting.

  JONAS
     Thank you, Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c nods at Hammond as he and Jonas leave.


LOCATION--A ROAD--NIGHTTIME

  ANNOTATION
     Two army vehicles are driving down the road.
     Teal'c and Jonas are in one of them, with Teal'c
     driving.

  JONAS
     I should have been with them.

  TEAL'C
     Do you believe you could have prevented this from
     happening?

  JONAS
     Maybe. You don't think so?

  TEAL'C
     It was an ambush. I believe your presence would
     have made little difference.

  JONAS
     Like on the Cargo Ship?

  TEAL'C
     You could not have known those Jaffa would ring
     aboard ship.

  JONAS
     Yeah. I stood there! You saved my life like Dr.
     Jackson did back on my planet. I didn't do a
     thing!

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks at Jonas, eyebrow raised. Jonas
     sighs.

  TEAL'C
     It is my understanding that it was largely your
     idea that lead to the successful disposal of the
     other Stargate before it could be detonated.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c looks across at Jonas.

  TEAL'C
     You saved the lives of millions.

  JONAS
     Yeah, that was different. That was an intellectual
     exercise. I'm talking about knowing what you can
     do in the heat of the moment when there is no time
     to think.

  TEAL'C
     One can never be certain until the opportunity
     presents itself.

  JONAS
     So far, my track record is not great.

  TEAL'C
     Perhaps that is so.

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c again look across at Jonas.

  TEAL'C
     But there are many battles left to be fought,
     JonasQuinn.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas looks at Teal'c, who nods. Both turn to the
     front.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Jacob are sitting on the steps leading
     to the throne. Jacob is cradling his left arm
     close to his body.

  O'NEILL
     How are you doing?

  JACOB
     Aside from the burns, I got a broken collarbone.
     Selmak's working on it.

  O'NEILL
     You know, for guys with no life signs, those Jaffa
     did a bit of damage.

  JACOB
     They must have been trapped in the section of the
     ship that was sealed off. To stay alive as long as
     possible, they would have gone into a deep state
     of Kel-no-reem,slowing down their heartrate to one
     or two beats per minute. In that condition, the
     cargo ship's senses weren't sensitive enough to
     pick them up.

  O'NEILL
     Think there are any more running around?

  JACOB
     I doubt it. My guess is the three that attacked me
     were on the computer core level. I let them out
     when I opened the door to allow Sam inside.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Davis enter the control room.

  CARTER
     Well, we've got life support operating at fifty
     percent. It won't be too comfortable in here, but
     at least we won't freeze to death...right away.

  JACOB
     Can we fix the engines?

  DAVIS
     Not a chance, and that's not our only problem.

  CARTER
     We found evidence of structural damage on the
     lower levels. Probably a result of the impact.

  JACOB
     How bad?

  CARTER
     I'm not sure. The exterior pressure's pretty
     severe, especially on the lower levels of this
     ship. It wouldn't take much to compromise the
     hull.

  O'NEILL
     Well, help'll be on the way.

  CARTER
     There's also the matter of the self-destruct
     sequence frozen half way through its countdown.

  O'NEILL
     You haven't turned that off yet?

  CARTER
     No, Sir. And I'm not sure we should even try.

  O'NEILL
     Why?

  CARTER
     Well, first the door to the computer core was
     locked, and then when the Jaffa tried to blast
     their way in, the entire section was sealed off
     and life support was shut down.

  JACOB
     By who? O'NEILL It's whom.

  CARTER
     Actually, Sir, it's more like what.

  O'NEILL
     What?

  DAVIS
     The virus Thor left behind.

  CARTER
     Exactly. What if it was trying to defend itself?

  JACOB
     So Thor leaves behind a virus that forces Anubis
     to abandon his ship, and then this virus defends
     itself against the Jaffa Anubis left behind to
     blow this ship?

  CARTER
     Or...maybe it was left here so we could find it.
     Sir, with your permission, I'd like to return to
     the computer core.

  O'NEILL
     I'll go with you.

  CARTER
     Major Davis is right. It is definitely coming
     through the ship's intercom. Maybe the virus is
     trying to talk to us. [They arrive at a closed
     door. A small puddle of water has trickled from
     underneath the door. O'Neill walks up to the
     puddle and steps in it.] O'NEILL What the
     hey?</blockquote>

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Dad, we've got evidence of flooding
     here.

     Jacob tries to rise from the steps, holding his
     left shoulder. Davis helps him to his feet. They
     both make their way to the control panel. Jacob
     brings up the ship's schematic on the viewscreen.

  JACOB
     (Into radio) There's been a hull breach on the
     engineering level.

     O'Neill looks at Carter, puzzled.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) We're nowhere near engineering.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CONTROL ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) It looks like seawater penetrated
     into the central access shaft, and now the
     pressure's pushing it up through the core of the
     ship. We're flooding from the inside.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR

  ANNOTATION
     Both O'Neill and Carter look concerned. Suddenly,
     the door behind them begins to close.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) Dad, the door's closing behind us

  ANNOTATION
     Carter heads for the door control panel. She
     enters a code but the door remains closed.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) It's a security measure. All doors
     are sealed around the breach. I'll try to open it
     from here.

  ANNOTATION
     The water level in the room rises quickly to ankle
     height.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) I don't know, this is kind of a
     unique situation. Give me a few minutes.

  O'NEILL

  ANNOTATION
     The water is at neck-height for Carter. Both are
     removing outer clothing.

  CARTER
     Actually, Sir, it wouldn't make a difference. At
     this depth, all water is ice cold.

  O'NEILL
     Shallower water, then...shallower.

  CARTER
     Yes, Sir. I'll keep that in mind.

  O'NEILL

     Davis is working on a laptop computer. The garbled
     computerized noise is heard over the intercom.
     O'Neill and Carter are sitting on the throne
     steps, with Jacob and Jonas standing nearby.

  DAVIS
     It's definitely a voice. Give me a second, I'll
     see if I can clean it up.

  JONAS
     Why would it be so distorted?

  JACOB
     Anubis probably tried to shut it off.

  O'NEILL
     Carter?

  CARTER
     Well, the security program that locked us in that
     corridor didn't just shut down by itself.

  JACOB
     You think this virus Thor left in the ship's
     computer is acting intelligently?

  CARTER
     If that door hadn't have opened, Colonel O'Neill
     and I would have drowned.

  JONAS

  ANNOTATION
     The laptop monitor shows a pulse line, as a voice
     repeats over the intercom.

  THOR
     I am using the internal communication system to
     synthesize my voice...

  TEAL'C
     Thor spoke the same words to O'Neill and I when we
     were imprisoned aboard this vessel.

  CARTER
     Sir, maybe what we've been calling a virus isn't a
     virus at all. Maybe it's Thor.

  O'NEILL
     We got him off this ship months ago.

  CARTER
     Not before Anubis was able to download his mind
     into the computer core. Now, if his consciousness
     remained intact, he would be an independent entity
     operating within the system.

  JACOB
     His mind took control of the vessel.

  O'NEILL
     Way to go, Thor!

  CARTER
     Sir, the Asgard said that Thor was on life support
     but there was little chance that he'd come out of
     it.

  O'NEILL
     So?

  CARTER
     So, if we can download his consciousness from the
     computer, the Asgard can transfer it into a new
     cloned body.

  JACOB
     If that's what you want to do, Sam, you'd better
     move fast. The computer core isn't flooded yet,
     but it's only a matter of time.

  DAVIS
     Wait a second. If Thor is really in control of
     this ship, then he is the only thing keeping the
     self-destruct on hold. We remove that
     consciousness, the countdown will start up again.

  CARTER
     (To Teal'c) How much time will we have left when
     the countdown resumes?

  TEAL'C
     Approximately seventeen minutes.

  CARTER
     That gives us plenty of time to get out of here
     after we've got Thor.

  DAVIS
     I know Thor was a friend of yours, but this is a
     Goa'uld mothership! If we allow it to blow up,
     there'll be nothing left to salvage.

  JACOB
     Jack, this ship us never going to fly again. I'd
     say having the Supreme Commander of the Asgard
     Fleet owe you one is more valuable.

  O'NEILL
     Yeah...all right! Next mothership, we keep, okay?!
     Jonas, take Davis and Jacob back to the Sub, wait
     for us there.

  JONAS
     Colonel, I'd like to assist Major Carter...

     O'Neill looks from Carter to Teal'c, who does not
     react.

  O'NEILL
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c walk away from the
     closed door.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Davis, Jonas and Jacob run into the room.

  JONAS
     (To seaman) The ship's self-destruct has been
     activated. We need to get the DSRV as far away as
     possible.

  JACOB
     (Into radio) Jack, we're at the sub. What's your
     status?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c come upon another
     closed door. Carter puts the computer drive
     containing Thor aside.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Here's our plan, Jacob. We're going
     to take a couple of gliders.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) Jack, a glider isn't designed to
     operate underwater.

  CARTER
     (Into radio) It's our only shot.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM

  JACOB
     Uh, all right, all right.

  ANNOTATION
     Jacob rubs his forehead, as Jonas stands,
     listening.

  JACOB
     Umm...you'll have to activate the compartment's
     forcefield to stop the flooding. Now, those
     systems went off-line after the crash.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  CARTER
     I know. I'm trying to reroute the power from here.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is working at a panel, removing and
     replacing crystal modules.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM

  JONAS
     What is it?

  JACOB
     Glider bays have forcefields that allow ships to
     go in and out without having to depressurize the
     compartment. If she can't get it online, she won't
     be able to open the doors without flooding the
     hanger.

  JONAS
     Right!

  JACOB
     (Into radio) Sam?


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Jacob, I want you to get that sub to
     a minimum safe distance.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP EMBARKATION ROOM

  JACOB
     (Into radio) Understood. (To Jonas) Let's go.

  JONAS
     There's an auxiliary control panel on this deck. I
     could reroute the power from there.

  JACOB
     How do you know?

  JONAS
     Cause I've gone over the schematics of these
     motherships a dozen times, and I'm a very quick
     study.

  JACOB
     Yeah? Well, where is it?

  JONAS
     Don't wait for me.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas heads down the corridor at a run.

  JACOB
     Right, now...Jonas!


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter is still rearranging the crystal modules as
     O'Neill and Teal'c look on.

  O'NEILL
     No pressure, Carter.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill pats Carter on the shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     Plenty of time.

  TEAL'C
     On the contrary, O'Neill.

  O'NEILL
     Lots and lots...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill glares at Teal'c and makes the cutthroat
     gesture.

  O'NEILL
     ...of time!

  CARTER
     Yes, Sir.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) Jack.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Jacob, will you please get out of
     here?

  JACOB
     (Over radio) We are, but Jonas went off to try to
     get the forcefield online from a relay panel on
     this deck. Listen...good luck!


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas runs up to a closed door. He removes his
     outer vest and jacket. He enters a code on the
     control panel of an opened doorway to close the
     door and also enters a code on the panel of the
     already closed door. He removes his shoes and
     holds onto the doorframe.

  JONAS
     Okay!

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas takes a couple of deep breaths as he punches
     the final code into the panel. The door mechanism
     is heard, and the sound of water.


LOCATION--OCEAN

  ANNOTATION
     The DSRV detaches from the mothership and turns to
     leave.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     Carter looks up from the control panel as the
     computerized Goa'uld voice again comes over the
     intercom.

  O'NEILL
     What'd he say?

  TEAL'C
     We are being advised that in approximately seven
     minutes, the ship will be destroyed.

  O'NEILL
     Ah, see?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill again pats Carter's shoulder.

  O'NEILL
     Plenty of time.

  CARTER
     This terminal isn't tied into the primary system.
     I can't reroute the power from here.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     The corridor is quickly filling with water. Jonas
     is holding onto the doorframe, taking deep
     breaths. As the water reaches his chin, he dives
     underwater. He swims under the opening door to the
     control panel. He rearranges some crystal modules,
     then presses a couple of buttons that illuminate.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     The panel that Carter is working on illuminates.

  CARTER
     Forcefield just came online.

  O'NEILL
     Nice!

  CARTER
     It wasn't me.

  TEAL'C
     Jonas.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas, still underwater, swims to another control
     panel and activates it. He swims away from the
     walls and floats upright. Suddenly, transportation
     rings are activated around him. The rings reappear
     in an unflooded section. Jonas drops to the floor,
     engulfed by water that was ringed down with him.
     He gasps for air, then rises.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP CORRIDOR TO GLIDER BAY

  CARTER
     Okay

  ANNOTATION
     Carter moves to the door's control panel and
     punches in a code. The glider bay door opens. They
     are about to step through as Jonas comes running
     down the corridor towards them.

  JONAS
     Wait! Wait! Did it work?

  O'NEILL
     We're about to find out.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill, Carter, Teal'c and Jonas step into the
     glider bay.


LOCATION--OCEAN

  ANNOTATION
     The DSRV is moving away from the mothership.


LOCATION--MOTHERSHIP GLIDER BAY

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c and Carter step into a glider, with Teal'c
     in the pilot seat.

  TEAL'C
     Powering engines.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill and Jonas step into another glider, with
     O'Neill in the pilot seat. O'Neill powers up the
     glider.

  O'NEILL
     Listen, if we don't survive this...thanks.

  JONAS
     You're welcome.


LOCATION--TEAL'C AND CARTER'S GLIDER

  CARTER
     Opening glider bay doors.

  ANNOTATION
     The bay doors open. The forcefield is in place.
     Both glider hatches close.


LOCATION--O'NEILL AND JONAS' GLIDER

  O'NEILL
     Nice!

  ANNOTATION
     Both gliders take off, though the flight is bumpy.

  O'NEILL
     Hang on!

  ANNOTATION
     An explosion occurs behind them, and as the
     gliders fly out of the water another, larger,
     explosion, comes up from the sea.

  O'NEILL
     Wo-Ho!

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c's glider appears alongside.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Everybody all right?

  CARTER
     (Over radio) Yes, Sir. We're fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Carter and Teal'c's glider peels away.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) This is Jacob. We're a little seasick
     down here, but we're in one piece, too.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Glad to hear it.

  JACOB
     (Over radio) What about Jonas?

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) All members of SG-1 present and
     accounted for.

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is looking around, grinning.

  O'NEILL
     (Into radio) Teal'c, take lead.


LOCATION--TEAL'C AND SAM'S GLIDER

  ANNOTATION
     Teal'c salutes, and sharply peels away.


LOCATION--O'NEILL AND JONAS' GLIDER

  ANNOTATION
     Jonas is still grinning.

  O'NEILL
     Are you smiling?

  JONAS
     First time in a death glider.

  O'NEILL
     Oh! Well...

  ANNOTATION
     O'Neill does a roll, startling Jonas who grabs at
     the glider hatch. Stunned, Jonas shakes away the
     dizziness as O'Neill smirks. The two gliders fly
     into the distance.
