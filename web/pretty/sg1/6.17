There are several dignitaries chatting to each other, pouring themselves tea, etc. In the middle of the room is a horseshoe-shaped table. Flags of several prominent nations are in the corners of the room. USAF airmen stand guard at the doors. The room is quite dimly lit. Chekov is seen pouring himself tea. He drops a lump of sugar in. He turns to the Chinese ambassador.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>CHEKOV: Yes. Unfortunately the Rostov's reactor went critical before she arrived on the scene.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>CHINESE: I have heard your government repeat this story time and time again. Yet according to our naval intelligence service, on the day in question, the submarine in question was in fact still taking on supplies in the harbour at Vladivostok</td></tr>

Please forgive any security measures you've had to undergo in order to get here. In America, we try never to underestimate the competence or curiosity of our media. We've asked you here to inform you of a top-secret operation the United States Air Force has been operating out of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. It's called the Stargate Program.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>DAVIS: The device itself was discovered in Egypt in 1928 where it lay buried for several thousand years. In 1945, a team of scientists hoping to find a military application for the device successfully established a stable wormhole by a process of random dialling. It was, for all intents and purposes, a lucky accident, which they were unable to repeat. The Gate remained inactive. Until eight years ago, when this man, (He clicks a button, and a picture and biographical details of Daniel come on screen) Dr. Daniel Jackson, joined the programme. Dr. Jackson successfully deciphered the symbols on the Gate, allowing us to begin routine exploration of alien worlds. Since that time, Mr. Ambassadors, we have visited literally hundreds of planets. Thousands more remain to be explored.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>HAMMOND: One of our own people illegally sold the Russians information which allowed them to temporarily operate their own program.</td></tr>

The Asgard ship suffers a crippling explosion, and careers out of control in the atmosphere, pulling apart and crashing into the ocean in a huge fireball.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>DAVIS: So the Gate the Russians recovered from the Pacific was the Gate first discovered in Egypt. We replaced that Gate with the we discovered in Antarctica five years ago.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>HAMMOND: That Stargate has since been destroyed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>DAVIS: The original Gate is back in Cheyenne Mountain under lease from the Russian government.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>BRITISH: (With increasing sarcasm) Oh no, no, no, no. What could be more clear. There were two different sorts of alien ships. I follow completely. You know this is much more believable than the accidental loss of a Russian submarine. Although I am a bit dubious that not one, but two reported meteors in the last few years were in fact alien ships.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>DAVIS: Actually, there were three.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>KINSEY: You're telling me you've been at this God knows how long and they don't even believe you? If that doesn't take the cake. Well I don't know what they've told you but it's true. The Stargate exists and they go through the damn thing on a daily basis.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>KINSEY: The truth is, I demanded to know where all the money was going and believe you me, we're talking about a lot of money. I'm sure that what you're finding hard to believe is why we would come forward with any of this. Granted the Chinese government has threatened to go public with information that contradicts one of our cover stories, but that isn't the only reason. (Looking pointedly at Hammond) The fact is, due in no small part to the actions of the Stargate program's flagship team, SG-1, (turning to the ambassadors) our planet is facing imminent danger.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>BRITISH: So, assuming this is not some sort of elaborate hoax and there are no television cameras ready to pop out at any moment, these aliens who threaten to destroy Earth even as we speak.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>DAVIS: No Sir. The Gate system was built by a much older race that have long since disappeared. Now while the Goa'uld regularly use the Gate, they subjugate these transplanted human races with powerful ships that are capable of interstellar travel.</td></tr>
