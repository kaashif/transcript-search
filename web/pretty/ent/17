TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A small ship with curved nacelles is on the
     viewscreen.

  ARCHER
     Doesn't look like any Vulcan ship I've ever seen.

  T'POL
     This class of vessel hasn't been used for a long
     time.

  HOSHI
     They're hailing us again.

  TAVIN [on viewscreen]
     Is this the Earth vessel Enterprise?

  ARCHER
     It is. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer.

  TAVIN [on viewscreen]
     My name is Tavin, Captain of the Vahklas. It's
     very good to meet you.

  ANNOTATION
     He's older, going grey, with a hint of a smile.

  ARCHER
     I get the feeling you weren't sent out here by the
     High Command.

  TAVIN [on viewscreen]
     Not quite. We're a civilian ship.

  ARCHER
     What brings you out this far?

  TAVIN [on viewscreen]
     I suppose you could say we're on a mission of
     exploration.

  ARCHER
     From what I'm told, Vulcans aren't that interested
     in exploring.

  TAVIN [on viewscreen]
     We're not typical Vulcans. I'd be happy to
     explain, but first I'd like to ask a favour.

  ARCHER
     Certainly.

  TAVIN [on viewscreen]
     Our propulsion and life-support systems are in
     need of repair. We'd be grateful for any
     assistance you could offer.

  ARCHER
     We'll see what we can do.


LOCATION--Captain's mess

  ANNOTATION
     The two ships are docked together.

  TAVIN
     We've noticed the High Command looking over our
     shoulders on several occasions as well.

  ARCHER
     That's good to know. I was starting to think
     they'd singled us out. Our chef's had a lot of
     experience lately preparing Vulcan dishes. T'Pol
     says he's gotten pretty good at it.

  ANNOTATION
     Tavin points at Archer's plate.

  TAVIN
     What is that?

  ARCHER
     Oh, it's called chicken.

  TAVIN
     May I?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol glares then passes his plate.

  ARCHER
     Of course. It's, er, meat, you know.

  TAVIN
     It looks delicious.

  ARCHER
     So, when did you leave Vulcan?

  TAVIN
     Eight years ago.

  TOLARIS
     (a younger man) And in those eight years we've
     experienced more than most Vulcans will in their
     lifetime.

  ARCHER
     You said you were explorers?

  TAVIN
     Yes, but it's not space we're exploring. It's
     ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     He samples the chicken, and beams.

  TAVIN
     Mmm!

  T'POL
     You're V'tosh ka'tur.

  ARCHER
     I'm sorry?

  TAVIN
     Vulcans without logic. It's a name the Elders give
     to anyone who disagrees with the ancestral
     teachings, but it's not entirely accurate. We
     haven't abandoned logic. We've simply learned to
     exist without the need to continually repress our
     emotions. It's taken years of experimentation, but
     we've managed to find a balance between the two.

  T'POL
     That's not possible.

  TOLARIS
     Here we are.

  TAVIN
     Logic is an essential part of Vulcan existence,
     but it has to complement emotions, not exclude
     them.

  TOLARIS
     You must know a great deal about emotion. You live
     on a human starship. That's not something that
     many Vulcans would be comfortable with.

  T'POL
     I am here as an observer.

  TOLARIS
     I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.

  T'POL
     I'm not capable of feeling offence.

  ARCHER
     My Chief Engineer tells me your repairs are going
     to take three or four days. We were going to use
     that time to explore the nebula, if you don't mind
     tagging along.

  TAVIN
     Not at all.


LOCATION--Engineering} (Tucker looks at his monitor.) TUCKER: I've never seen an engine this far gone. We're going to have to swap out every plasma relay in your reactor. KOV: (young, brown-haired, a little tubby) There are a lot of women on your ship. TUCKER: Yeah, nearly a third of the crew. KOV: Is it true you mate year-round, with any of them you choose? TUCKER: You haven't been around humans too much, have you? KOV: You're the first we've met, but I've heard a lot of stories. Your people indulge their passions. Do you really eat six meals a day? TUCKER: More like three. KOV: And what about sleep? I understand you spend more than half the day in bed. TUCKER: Eight hours. We sleep for eight hours. In my case, about six. When we're through here maybe we can get a bite to eat. I might be able to clear up some of your misconceptions. KOV: I'd like that, Commander. TUCKER: Call me Trip. [Ready room

  T'POL
     They've asked for any medical supplies we can
     spare and a thousand litres of plasma coolant.

  ARCHER
     Well, that shouldn't be a problem.

  T'POL
     Tavin has also requested the recipe for Chicken
     Marsala.

  ARCHER
     Tell him Chef's recipes are usually classified
     but, we'll make an exception in this case. I
     thought you'd be spending a little more time
     getting to know our guests.

  T'POL
     I've been busy.

  ARCHER
     It seems to me like, you've been busy avoiding
     them. I can understand that you might not approve
     of what they're trying to do, but for all we know
     they're onto something.

  T'POL
     That's unlikely.

  ARCHER
     Is it? Eight years. That's a pretty good track
     record.

  T'POL
     Just because they smile and eat chicken doesn't
     mean they've learned to master their emotions.

  ARCHER
     Maybe I'm just relieved to finally meet some
     Vulcans who aren't giving me a hard time. Then
     again, if they have found this balance.

  T'POL
     They're not the first ones to attempt this,
     Captain. Others have tried to reintegrate their
     emotions. They all failed. What they're doing is
     dangerous.

  ARCHER
     Unless my instincts are way off, they don't seem
     very dangerous to me. But I could be wrong. I
     can't order you to spend time with them, but I
     would encourage you to keep an open mind.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     It is empty, save for T'Pol getting a hot drink
     whilst reading a PADD.

  TOLARIS
     So this is the mess hall.

  T'POL
     It is.

  TOLARIS
     The crew must not have much of an appetite.

  T'POL
     Most of them are asleep. It's quite late.

  TOLARIS
     Could you show me how to operate this?

  ANNOTATION
     The drinks dispenser.

  T'POL
     What would you like?

  TOLARIS
     I'm not sure. I don't have much experience with
     human food. What's that?

  T'POL
     Mint tea.

  TOLARIS
     That'll be fine.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes a mug from the cupboard, puts it into
     the dispenser, presses a button and says -

  T'POL
     Mint tea, hot.

  ANNOTATION
     Liquid pours into the mug and she hands it to him.

  TOLARIS
     Thank you. It has a lot of flavour.

  T'POL
     You can try something else.

  TOLARIS
     No, it's fine. I'm just surprised. Do you like the
     taste?

  T'POL
     Their selection of Vulcan beverages is limited.

  TOLARIS
     But it can make Vulcan tea.

  T'POL
     Yes.

  TOLARIS
     Interesting.

  T'POL
     Unless you need further assistance

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol starts to leave.

  TOLARIS
     How long have you lived among humans?

  T'POL
     I spent two years at the Vulcan consulate on Earth
     and seven months on Enterprise.

  TOLARIS
     That's a long time away from home. Living here has
     obviously affected you in ways that you don't
     realise.

  T'POL
     You may be right. On occasion, I also drink
     chamomile tea.

  TOLARIS
     And you have a sense of humour. A concept that
     most Vulcans can't seem to grasp.

  T'POL
     You're easily amused.

  TOLARIS
     There's that humour again. I'm curious, why do you
     stay here?

  T'POL
     Captain Archer needs a Science Officer.

  TOLARIS
     Is that the only reason? Maybe you're more
     attached to these people than you'd care to admit.

  T'POL
     What makes you say that?

  TOLARIS
     Your emotions are much closer to the surface than
     other Vulcans. They're easier to read.

  T'POL
     I have yet to mediate this evening. Perhaps that's
     what you're sensing.

  TOLARIS
     This may surprise you, but we still meditate. The
     balance between emotion and logic requires
     constant discipline.

  T'POL
     So you've said. You and your colleagues have
     chosen a reckless path.

  TOLARIS
     Have we?

  T'POL
     History's shown that Vulcans who attempt to
     embrace their emotions often revert to their
     primal nature.

  TOLARIS
     That's a myth. Propaganda from five thousand years
     ago. Our primal nature, T'Pol, is not as dangerous
     as you think. Commander Tucker suggests that I try
     something called pizza. Would you care to join me?

  T'POL
     I've already eaten. Another time, perhaps.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Is it what you imagined, sir?

  ARCHER
     Pictures don't do it justice.

  TRAVIS
     It's big. Over eight billion kilometres in
     diameter.

  ARCHER
     Eight billion? Are you sure?

  TRAVIS
     According to sensors.

  ARCHER
     My astronomy book said it was only six and a half.

  HOSHI
     We'll have to send our readings to the publisher
     so they can put out a revised edition.

  ARCHER
     How long would it take to chart that thing?

  T'POL
     Several weeks.

  TAVIN
     My vessel is equipped with translinear sensors. We
     could help you complete the survey a good deal
     quicker.

  ARCHER
     We should have someone on your ship to monitor the
     data. (to T'Pol) Would you mind working from
     there?

  T'POL
     No.

  ARCHER
     (to Tavin) Glad you dropped by. Take us in,
     Travis.

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise enters the blue haze of the Arachnid
     nebula.


LOCATION--Vahklas sensor control

  ANNOTATION
     The nebula is on the main monitor.

  TOLARIS
     Look at that. I've never seen anything so
     beautiful. You'd probably consider that an
     emotional reaction.

  T'POL
     Not necessarily. It is aesthetically pleasing.

  TOLARIS
     Pleasing. Coming from you, that's practically an
     outburst.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol spots a statue in an alcove.

  T'POL
     It's curious that people who reject Surak's
     teachings would display his likeness.

  TOLARIS
     We don't reject his teachings. We simply disagree
     with how they're interpreted. Have you read his
     original text? He never intended for us to purge
     our emotions. He wanted us to master them, and
     then carefully integrate them into our lives.

  T'POL
     I doubt many would agree with you.

  TOLARIS
     That doesn't mean we're wrong.

  T'POL
     What did you do on Vulcan before you left?

  TOLARIS
     I taught literature at the Shirkar Academy.

  T'POL
     You gave up a great deal to wander the galaxy in a
     transport.

  TOLARIS
     I don't have any regrets. I always knew there had
     to be more to life than just logic and reason.
     Haven't you ever felt that way?

  T'POL
     Not recently.

  TOLARIS
     But you did once?

  T'POL
     Once. I should take these readings back to
     Enterprise.

  TOLARIS
     T'Pol, you said that you meditated each night.
     Tonight, don't. See what happens. I think you'll
     find your dreams will be far more interesting.
     You're a scientist. Consider it an experiment.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TUCKER
     Where'd you hear that?

  KOV
     A Vulcan anthropologist told me he'd seen the
     ritual during an Earth expedition.
