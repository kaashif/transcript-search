<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Maybe I'm just relieved to finally meet some Vulcans who aren't giving me a hard time. Then again, if they have found this balance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>T'POL:  They're not the first ones to attempt this, Captain. Others have tried to reintegrate their emotions. They all failed. What they're doing is dangerous.</td></tr>
