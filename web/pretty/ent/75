I've just come from Sickbay, where the Doctor assures me that Sergeant Kemper and Ensign Sato will make full recoveries. Unfortunately, Major Hayes' injuries were more severe. He didn't survive. I'm sorry. We've got less than ten hours before this weapon reaches Earth. The Captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it. I don't imagine the reptilians will make this easy for us, but that's why you're here. That's why Major Hayes picked each one of you for this mission. Because he knew you'd get the job done. I need three volunteers. (all step forward) Woods, Ramira, Forbes. Assemble your gear. Meet me at the starboard airlock in ten minutes.</td></tr>
