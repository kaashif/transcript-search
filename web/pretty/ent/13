<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>PHLOX:  Oh, it's superficial. Only first degree burns. A little dermoline gel should do the trick.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>PHLOX [OC]:  Most of my work is fairly routine. Scrapes and bruises, the occasional emergency. And you'll be pleased to hear that the crew finally seems to be growing accustomed to an alien doctor on board. I must admit, I wasn't planning to stay this long but the opportunity to observe your species on their first deep space venture has proven irresistible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>PHLOX [OC]:  It's a bit daunting at times, trying to socialise with the crew, form friendships, but our profession guarantees that sooner or later everyone comes to see us. It makes interaction quite a bit easier.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>PHLOX [OC]:  I never thought I'd meet a species that forges such intimate bonds with lesser creatures. It's surprising the things you humans choose to invest your emotions in.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>PHLOX [OC]:  I've noticed how the captain seems to anthropomorphise his pet. He even talks to the creature although I'm fairly certain it has no idea what he's saying. Then again, I've been known to speak to my Pyrithian bat on occasion.</td></tr>

I said before that my duties entail the occasional emergency. Emergencies, it seems, come in all shapes and sizes. I was once nearly overwhelmed by fifty patients in a refugee camp on Matalas.
