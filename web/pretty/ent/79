Earth's been holding its breath for the past year, wondering if the Xindi were going to come back and finish the job.

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>ARCHER:  It's an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies. Ships in the Expanse used it to insulate their hulls.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>ARCHER:  They attacked us the minute we docked. The trellium had a toxic effect on the Vulcans. It damaged their neural pathways. They lost the ability to suppress their emotions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>ARCHER:  You did everything you could to sabotage our mission. I got more help from the Andorians than I ever got from the High Command.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>REED:  Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia. It's hard to believe in this day and age. I'm told the Vulcans are staying behind the walls of their compound.</td></tr>
