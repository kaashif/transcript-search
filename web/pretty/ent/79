  ANNOTATION
     Archer strolls in, in civvies.

  ERIKA
     Excuse me.

  ARCHER
     Scotch.

  ERIKA
     The bar's reserved for regular customers. Galactic
     heroes have to sit at a table.

  ARCHER
     I heard about your promotion. Congratulations,
     Captain.

  ERIKA
     Thank you.

  ARCHER
     Cheers.

  ERIKA
     Cheers. So what was it like in the Expanse?

  ARCHER
     You'll be at the debriefing tomorrow, won't you? I
     wouldn't want to spoil any surprises. Besides,
     I've got more important questions. Seen any good
     movies while I was gone?

  ERIKA
     Another World War III epic. It swept all the
     awards. But you haven't missed much. Earth's been
     holding its breath for the past year, wondering if
     the Xindi were going to come back and finish the
     job. On the bright side, there've been more
     weddings and births than ever before.

  ARCHER
     I don't see a ring.

  ERIKA
     I'm married to Starfleet. Just like you.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The door chimes.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  TUCKER
     Well, it looks like you're taking enough clothes
     to last a year.

  T'POL
     You wanted something?

  TUCKER
     I told the Captain I wanted to stay aboard and
     supervise the refit, but he suggested I take a
     break. More like an order, actually. Problem is,
     I'm not sure where to go. Lizzie's gone, my home
     town doesn't exist anymore. Guess this is my home
     now.

  T'POL
     You could come with me.

  TUCKER
     To Vulcan?

  T'POL
     The transport leaves at eleven hundred hours.

  TUCKER
     Where would I stay?

  T'POL
     There's a guest room in my mother's home.

  TUCKER
     Oh, your mom's house, huh? What does she know
     about me? About us?

  T'POL
     I've never mentioned you.

  TUCKER
     So you'd introduce me as?

  T'POL
     Commander Charles Tucker the third. You've told
     the Captain that you don't get to see as many
     alien cultures as you'd like. You've never been to
     Vulcan.

  TUCKER
     Eleven hundred hours, huh? I'd better start
     packing.


LOCATION--NX02 - Columbia - Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     She is still being fitted out in Spacedock.

  ERIKA
     We've tied these stations directly in the primary
     EPS junction.

  ARCHER
     I hope you don't mind if I steal some of these
     improvements.

  ERIKA
     I won't say anything if you do me a small favour.
     My senior officer candidates. I'd like to get your
     opinion. You've served with a few of them.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands over a data chip. Archer refers to the
     Captain's chair.

  ARCHER
     You might want to talk to someone about installing
     a lumbar support. You're going to spend a lot of
     hours in that chair.

  ERIKA
     We've improved hull polarisation by twelve
     percent. We'll be able to hang in a firefight a
     little longer.

  ARCHER
     Ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers, pulsed phase
     cannons.

  ERIKA
     Upgrades you recommended. What is it?

  ARCHER
     I had an argument once with Captain Jefferies. He
     was one of the designers of the NX-Class.

  ERIKA
     I'm aware of that.

  ARCHER
     I told him I didn't want to be in command of a
     warship trying to make first contact with new
     species. Jefferies was right. We needed those
     weapons, and a hell of a lot more.


LOCATION--Starfleet HQ

  ANNOTATION
     The debriefing session.

  ARCHER
     The asteroids were loaded with trellium ore. We
     think the Vulcans entered the field in order to
     mine it.

  WILLIAMS
     Trellium?

  ARCHER
     It's an alloy that protects against spatial
     anomalies. Ships in the Expanse used it to
     insulate their hulls.

  WILLIAMS
     Your log reflects that when you boarded the Seleya
     you found the crew in a delusional, violent state.

  ARCHER
     They attacked us the minute we docked. The
     trellium had a toxic effect on the Vulcans. It
     damaged their neural pathways. They lost the
     ability to suppress their emotions.

  SOVAL
     According to your log, the entire crew of the
     Seleya was killed when you triggered a reactor
     breach.

  ARCHER
     The breach was an accident. We were trying to
     disable their power grid.

  SOVAL
     As far as I can determine, you didn't try to save
     a single Vulcan crewman.

  ARCHER
     There was no point. They were too far gone.

  SOVAL
     Is that your medical opinion, Captain?

  ARCHER
     Phlox made that determination.

  SOVAL
     Our specialists have examined the data you sent
     back. It's far from certain that the neurological
     damage was irreversible.

  ARCHER
     There was nothing we could do for them.

  SOVAL
     T'Pol was exposed to the trellium. She recovered.

  ARCHER
     I couldn't help them!

  SOVAL
     There's no need to get emotional, Captain. You
     spent several hours in the ship's auxiliary
     control room. In that time, did you try to access
     the internal sensors, or download the computer
     database?

  ARCHER
     No.

  SOVAL
     So in effect, we don't know what really happened
     aboard the Seleya.

  ARCHER
     What the hell does that mean?

  SOVAL
     Because of this oversight, we'll never have a
     complete picture of the events that led to the
     ship's destruction.

  ARCHER
     I just told you exactly what led to the ship's
     destruction.

  FORREST
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     I'm not going to sit here and be accused of
     murdering those people.

  SOVAL
     No one is accusing you of anything, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Maybe that crew would still be alive if you'd been
     a little more helpful.

  SOVAL
     I beg your pardon?

  ARCHER
     You did everything you could to sabotage our
     mission. I got more help from the Andorians than I
     ever got from the High Command.

  FORREST
     That's enough, Captain.

  ARCHER
     This planet would be a cloud of dust right now if
     we'd listened to you.

  FORREST
     That's enough!


LOCATION--Forrest's office

  ARCHER
     How can you be taking his side?

  FORREST
     I am not taking anyone's side. You were out of
     line.

  ARCHER
     They don't lift a finger to help us and now I have
     to justify myself to that son of a bitch?

  FORREST
     The debriefing's on hold, indefinitely. I want you
     to take some time off to clear your head.

  ARCHER
     With all due respect, Admiral, I don't need a
     vacation.

  FORREST
     That's an order, Captain!


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is overloaded with dufflebags and animal
     carry-boxes.

  PHLOX
     Lieutenant. If you wouldn't mind.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed takes some off him.

  REED
     Not exactly travelling light, are you?

  PHLOX
     Thank you. Why leave the comforts of home, when
     you can take it all with you?

  REED
     Okay. I trust you'll be taking the proper
     precautions on the surface.

  PHLOX
     What do you mean?

  REED
     I'm surprised you haven't heard. An Andorian and
     two Rigelians were attacked.

  PHLOX
     Attacked? Why?

  REED
     Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree
     of xenophobia. It's hard to believe in this day
     and age. I'm told the Vulcans are staying behind
     the walls of their compound.

  PHLOX
     Well, I'm not going to let a few isolated
     incidents disrupt my vacation plans. I lived on
     Earth for many years before coming aboard
     Enterprise.

  REED
     I don't think this is the same planet you
     remember, Doctor. People are looking for someone
     to blame and they don't care who it is.

  PHLOX
     I appreciate your concern, but I'll be fine. Would
     you?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed opens the airlock for him.

  PHLOX
     Thank you.


LOCATION--By a tranquil lake

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is checking a length of rope.

  ARCHER
     Mind if I ask what you're doing here?

  ERIKA
     You know better than to go climbing without a
     partner.


LOCATION--Vulcan - T'Pol's family home

  ANNOTATION
     The sky is red, and so is the rock as T'Pol opens
     the door and they go into a courtyard with
     oriental overtones including a gnarled small tree
     and a water feature of a giant urn with trickling
     water.

  TUCKER
     What about that volcano we saw on the way down,
     Mount Tar'ana?

  T'POL
     Tar'hana.

  TUCKER
     It still active?

  T'POL
     There are frequent eruptions. We can schedule a
     tour of the crater, if you're interested.

  TUCKER
     Volcanoes, ancient ruins, fire plains. I'm not
     sure where to start. So, this is where you grew
     up. It's not like I imagined.

  T'POL
     Meaning?

  TUCKER
     Well, it's beautiful.

  T'POL
     Vulcans appreciate beauty.

  TUCKER
     Well, I had no doubt about that. You always were a
     snazzy dresser.

  T'POL
     Commander Tucker, I suggest

  T'LES
     You didn't tell me you were bringing a guest.

  T'POL
     Mother, you're home.

  T'LES
     Obviously. It's agreeable to see you. You appear
     well.

  TUCKER
     I'm Charles Tucker. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

  ANNOTATION
     He manages the v-salute, and she responds.

  T'LES
     (to T'Pol, in Vulcan) Why is he here?

  T'POL
     (in Vulcan) Commander Tucker is my colleague. He
     wanted to visit Vulcan.

  T'LES
     (in Vulcan) This is the first time you've brought
     a colleague home with you.

  T'LES
     You both must be very tired after your journey.

  ANNOTATION
     she leads the way into the living room

  T'LES
     The guest room is on the south end of the house.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves them.

  T'POL
     It's not yet midday. Why aren't you at the Science
     Academy?

  T'LES
     I'm no longer an instructor there. I wrote you a
     letter. Didn't Starfleet transmit it to your ship?

  T'POL
     We had communication difficulties in the Expanse.

  T'LES
     I don't know why you're surprised. This was
     planned years ago. There's more to life than one's
     profession. Perhaps you'll learn that one day. It
     seems that I'm not the only one who knew you were
     coming. You received this yesterday.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands over a letter.

  T'POL
     It's from Koss.

  T'LES
     Did you believe he had forgotten you? You're going
     to respond.

  T'POL
     I have nothing to say to Koss.

  T'LES
     He's your fianc.

  T'POL
     Former fianc.

  T'LES
     That is a matter for debate. It would be wise for
     you to speak with him.


LOCATION--Climbing a rock face

  ERIKA
     You probably don't want to hear this, but I got a
     call from my brother yesterday. They renamed my
     old high school after you. How many is that, two,
     three dozen?

  ARCHER
     I'm not counting.

  ERIKA
     That's just North America. I don't think Zefram
     Cochrane has that many schools named after him.

  ANNOTATION
     Further on -

  ERIKA
     So, did you get a chance to look 'em over?

  ARCHER
     Look what over?

  ERIKA
     My senior officer candidates. Any suggestions for
     Tactical?

  ARCHER
     You may want to find someone with more field
     experience, a MACO.

  ERIKA
     I'm not sure how I feel about a military officer
     on the Bridge.

  ARCHER
     If I were you, I'd talk to General Casey about
     assigning an entire squad.

  ANNOTATION
     going up a sheer face, using pitons and ropes

  ARCHER
     Things have changed since Enterprise left
     Spacedock. You'll spend a lot of your time boldly
     going into battle.

  ERIKA
     Don't you think you're being a little cynical?

  ARCHER
     Did you read my reports?

  ERIKA
     Yes, Captain, I did.

  ANNOTATION
     She spots a pad mark.

  ERIKA
     Hey.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer scans it.

  ARCHER
     Mountain lion. Tracks are a few days old.

  ERIKA
     Good thing I have you to protect me.


LOCATION--T'Pol's family home - guest room

  ANNOTATION
     It's still dark when T'Les strikes the gong in the
     courtyard, and someone knocks at his door.

  TUCKER
     Come in.

  T'POL
     Good morning.

  TUCKER
     What time is it?

  T'POL
     Oh four hundred.

  TUCKER
     You're kidding.

  T'POL
     We have to prepare the morning meal. As guests,
     it's expected of us.


LOCATION--T'Pol's family home - living room

  ANNOTATION
     The sun is now up, and the three are settling down
     to the meal, mostly fruit by the looks of it.

  T'POL
     The nar'ru vines have bloomed early this year.

  T'LES
     I've had ample time to attend to them.

  T'POL
     It sounds as if you're not enjoying retirement.

  T'LES
     You still haven't told me the reason for your
     visit.

  T'POL
     I didn't know one was necessary.

  T'LES
     I thought perhaps you'd decided to rejoin the High
     Command.

  T'POL
     I've been offered a commission with Starfleet. If
     I accept, it could be several years before I'm
     able to return home.

  T'LES
     The gespar isn't fresh. My stasis unit needs to be
     replaced.

  TUCKER
     Well, I'd be happy to take a look at it. If I can
     recalibrate a warp reactor, I ought to be able to
     handle a kitchen appliance.

  T'LES
     My daughter's always been fascinated by alien
     worlds. She was all too eager to finish her
     schooling and leave Vulcan.

  T'POL
     As I recall, you encouraged me to leave.

  T'LES
     A mother is expected to push her young out of the
     nest. At some point, they're supposed to return.
     I'm told that on Earth a human child chooses their
     own path in life. They put their own wishes ahead
     of their family's.

  TUCKER
     That's true for the most part.

  T'LES
     You've learned much from them, haven't you?

  T'POL
     A Starfleet posting is no less important than one
     with the High Command. I'm sure Father would have
     approved.

  T'LES
     Your father believed that our work should enrich
     Vulcan society.

  T'POL
     Earth is supposed to be our ally.

  T'LES
     What's happened to you?

  T'POL
     We shouldn't argue in front of a guest.


LOCATION--Bar

  ANNOTATION
     Reed signs an autograph for two young women.

  REED
     Well, thank you, that's very kind of you to say.
     Unfortunately, we can't actually give tours of the
     ship. If that policy ever changes, you two will be
     the first to know.

  TRAVIS
     You had to wear that jacket.

  REED
     Do you think I wore this jacket to attract
     attention?

  ANNOTATION
     It does have the Enterprise patch on the sleeve.

  MAN
     How's your drink?

  PHLOX
     Delicious, thank you.

  MAN
     Because I'd heard someplace your people didn't
     like alcohol.

  PHLOX
     You may be thinking of Vulcans.

  MAN
     You know, you're right. I get your species mixed
     up all the time.

  REED
     Is there something we can help you with?

  MAN
     I'm just trying to make sure your friend here is
     comfortable. Sitting in a bar full of so many
     strange looking aliens like us.

  PHLOX
     I'm quite comfortable.

  MAN
     Because if you weren't, if humans make you nervous
     for some reason, the Vulcan Consulate's on the
     other side of the bridge. I'll bet there's
     someplace there where someone like yourself could
     get a nice, refreshing beverage.
