They'd already build New Berlin on the Moon, Utopia Planetia on Mars, even a few asteroid colonies, but all within our solar system.

After the colony was built, relations with Earth became strained. The Space Agency figured nothing succeeds like success, so they decided to send another vessel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>ARCHER:  The colonists protested. They'd been there five years, this was their home. They didn't want another two hundred people arriving. The folks back on Earth argued that there weren't any other habitable planets within reach, but the colonists dug their heels in. There were a few angry messages sent back and forth, then one day nobody heard from them again.</td></tr>
