This is one of the more interesting members of my little menagerie, a Lyssarrian Desert Larvae. It's epidermal layers secrete a viral suppressant that I use as a salve for cuts and bruises.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>PHLOX:  The larvae have another, somewhat more controversial, property. When implanted with the DNA from another species it exactly replicates that species' life-cycle, albeit at a rapidly accelerated rate.</td></tr>

There's no guarantee that human DNA will stimulate the larvae's growth cycle, but as it stands now it may be Commander Tucker's only hope for survival. To ensure the tissue's compatibility, I'll have to wait until the simbiot reaches Commander Tucker's present physical age, then I can excise the tissue from a non-critical region of the simbiot's cerebral region. It would experience no discernable side effects and should be able to live out it's normal life span.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>T'POL:  We sent out an EV team. They retrieved a sample of the substance accumulating on the hull. Multiple hits with a plasma rifle were required to dislodge it. It's composed of highly charged particles, mostly ferric ions, but there are several elements that we can't identify. (the sample leaps to Archer's mug and sticks there) And it's highly magnetic. So far, the danger to the ship seems negligible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>ARCHER:  But the longer we remain in the field, the more these particles build up. Do whatever you have to do, but we need to get those engines back online.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>T'POL:  Understood. Regarding the Lyssarrian procedure Doctor Phlox proposed, may I ask if you've reached a decision?</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>ARCHER:  I approved it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>T'POL:  Are you aware that the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave has banned the creation of simbiots?</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>ARCHER:  We don't answer to the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>T'POL:  Simbiots are living, conscious entities. We'll be growing a sentient being for the sole purpose of harvesting tissue.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>ARCHER:  I'm aware of the ethical implications. If we weren't in the Expanse maybe my decision would be different, but we've got to complete this mission. Earth needs Enterprise, Enterprise needs Trip. It's as simple as that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>SOMEONE: Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The engines are still down and the nucleonic particles continue to build up on the hull. It's been two days since Doctor Phlox initiated the procedure to grow the simbiot.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>PHLOX [OC}:  Lucky for me Denobulans require little sleep. I'm at a loss as to how human adults endure the REM cycle interruptions that accompany the teething stage. Though I knew what to expect, I can't help but be astonished by Sim's rapid physical development. A side note, I may have stumbled across an effective fertiliser for my Orsic fern.</td></tr>
