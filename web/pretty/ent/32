  ANNOTATION
     Tucker hears someone making gun noises. It's the
     boy, who is startled when Trip activates an alarm.

  TUCKER
     What are you doing in my chair?

  Q'ELL
     I didn't touch anything. I just like to look
     inside the ships that come here.

  TUCKER
     You should have asked.

  Q'ELL
     You might have said no.

  TUCKER
     Well, what do you think?

  Q'ELL
     Well, it's a little small and your thruster
     controls are hard to reach.

  TUCKER
     Maybe you need longer arms.

  Q'ELL
     How fast can it go?

  TUCKER
     She's designed for one quarter impulse, but, I've
     been able to squeeze a little more out of her.

  Q'ELL
     You're a pilot?

  TUCKER
     Engineer. Commander Trip Tucker.

  Q'ELL
     Q'ell.

  TUCKER
     Nice to meet you.

  Q'ELL
     Could you teach me how to fly it? I can drive the
     crawler that we use to move our drill rigs.

  TUCKER
     Tell you what. I'll be heading back up to the ship
     later. You can come along, if it's all right with
     your folks. I'll give you a tour.

  Q'ELL
     Really?


LOCATION--Settlement

  ANNOTATION
     In a tent, Tessic, Maklii - sans headband - and a
     woman are bartering with Archer and T'Pol.

  TESSIC
     Two power cells. We need six.

  ARCHER
     We can't spare that many. Maybe three.

  TESSIC
     Do you have any idea how much labour it takes to
     refine a litre of deuterium?

  ARCHER
     Actually, no. I'd enjoy seeing how your facility
     works.

  TESSIC
     We have three months of good weather, Captain.
     Three months to pump all the deuterium we can
     before the winter. We don't have time to give
     tours. Five power cells for two hundred litres. I
     can't do any better.

  E'LIS
     Our medical stores are running low.

  ARCHER
     Four power cells and whatever medical supplies we
     can spare.

  TESSIC
     All right. But only if you can repair our pumps.

  ARCHER
     Commander Tucker and his team will do the best
     they can.

  TESSIC
     I expect you to leave orbit in two days. If the
     pumps are working, you'll leave with the
     deuterium. If not, you'll leave without it. Are we
     agreed?

  ARCHER
     Agreed.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The woman is gazing at a four-legged starfish in a
     tank.

  PHLOX
     It's yours, if you'd like it.

  E'LIS
     I wouldn't know what to feed it.

  PHLOX
     Her needs are modest. A nutrient broth every three
     or four days. Less often when she's working.

  E'LIS
     Working?

  PHLOX
     She'll ingest a little blood while she's healing
     an injured artery.

  E'LIS
     Thank you, but I'll just take some vascular
     adhesive.

  PHLOX
     Try this, instead.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands over a gun-like contraption.

  E'LIS
     An auto-suture.

  PHLOX
     I'm surprised you don't have one.

  E'LIS
     This is a very expensive piece of equipment. I
     can't.

  PHLOX
     Nonsense. Please. Cardio-stimulator, neural shock
     kit. I had no idea processing deuterium was such a
     dangerous business.

  E'LIS
     It can be.

  PHLOX
     I've only heard of hexatriol being used to treat
     serious plasma burns.

  E'LIS
     Deuterium can burn almost as hot as plasma when
     it's ignited.

  PHLOX
     I hope you won't need it. Is there something
     wrong?

  E'LIS
     No. I'd better get back.

  PHLOX
     Of course.

  E'LIS
     Thank you again.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves carrying two cases of medical supplies.


LOCATION--Settlement

  ANNOTATION
     Walking among the structures in the blazing sun.

  ARCHER
     You've been to other colonies that trade
     deuterium, haven't you?

  T'POL
     Several.

  ARCHER
     Are they all this rustic?

  T'POL
     Not usually.

  ARCHER
     Their equipment's falling apart. Half these
     structures look like they're about to collapse.
     Phlox tells me they don't even have basic medical
     supplies. Deuterium is a highly valuable
     commodity. You'd think these people would be
     better off.

  T'POL
     We're here to trade with them, not judge their
     living conditions.

  ARCHER
     Then why do they need us to finish fixing their
     pumps in two days? What's the hurry?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Lieutenant, a ship just dropped out of warp. Six
     hundred thousand kilometres and closing.

  REED
     I see her.

  HOSHI
     It's probably more deuterium customers.

  TRAVIS
     I'm reading twelve biosigns, all Klingon.


LOCATION--Settlement

  TUCKER
     (to Maklii) You'll want to keep an eye on those
     phase inverters. They tend to depolarise.

  MAKLII
     (answering comm.) Pump Six.

  TESSIC [OC]
     Korok's ship is entering orbit.

  MAKLII
     I thought we had three more days.

  TESSIC [OC]
     Secure the pumps. Get everyone inside.

  TUCKER
     Some kind of trouble?

  MAKLII
     Help me close these induction valves.

  TUCKER
     What's going on? Who's Korok?


LOCATION--Inside a module

  T'POL
     They must realise that you trade with other ships.

  TESSIC
     They believe that we have an exclusive
     arrangement.

  E'LIS
     If they think anyone's been here before them, they
     get very angry.

  TESSIC
     (to Archer) Please, don't get involved. We'll talk
     to them.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Enterprise.

  REED [OC]
     Go ahead, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Have the Klingons detected Enterprise yet?

  REED
     No indication, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Six Klingons beam down from a tatty looking
     vessel.

  KOROK
     My old friend.

  TESSIC
     We weren't expecting you so soon. We've had
     trouble with two of our pumps.

  KOROK
     My crew's hungry. Let's have food and drink. Then
     we'll discuss business.

  TESSIC
     Your deuterium. We don't have all of it. We did
     our best but we need more time.


LOCATION--Inside a module

  TUCKER
     Can you make out what they're saying?

  T'POL
     Tessic is explaining that their yield isn't what
     they'd hoped.

  TUCKER
     Good ears.


LOCATION--Settlement

  TESSIC
     Without those pumps we couldn't operate at full
     capacity.

  KOROK
     I sense what you're about to say is not going to
     make me happy.

  TESSIC
     We can give you eighty thousand litres. If you'll
     give us one more week, we'll have the rest.

  KOROK
     You've had enough time. We'll take all of it, now.

  TESSIC
     We don't have it. I told you, two pumps were down.

  KOROK
     They all appear to be working.

  TESSIC
     We were just able to repair them.

  KOROK
     You're lying!

  ANNOTATION
     He knocks Tessic down.

  MAKLII
     Leave him alone. You'll get your deuterium.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets hit too. Archer restrains Tucker from
     going outside.

  TESSIC
     Wait, please.

  KOROK
     I can get deuterium anywhere. I come here because
     I like you, when you show me hospitality and
     respect.

  MAKLII
     You take everything we own, and you want us to
     respect you.

  KOROK
     I'll give you four days. Have it all ready. (into
     communicator) HIjol!

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingons are beamed away and the rest run out
     to help.

  E'LIS
     Let's get him inside.


LOCATION--Inside a module

  ANNOTATION
     Q'ell has got the medical kit all ready.

  ARCHER
     So this is your exclusive arrangement?

  TESSIC
     It's not your concern.

  ANNOTATION
     E'Lis starts tending Maklii's injury.

  TUCKER
     How long have these bullies been pushing you
     around?

  MAKLII
     Five seasons. They take all the first yield
     deuterium we can extract.

  E'LIS
     Hold still.

  MAKLII
     After they leave, we manage to pull a few thousand
     litres out of the deep strata, but it takes weeks
     and it's so full of impurities we can barely
     refine it.

  TESSIC
     It still brings in a decent price. We make enough
     to get through the winter.

  MAKLII
     Barely.

  T'POL
     Have you tried contacting your homeworld?

  TESSIC
     It's too far away.

  TUCKER
     You must have weapons. some way to defend
     yourselves. How many of them are there?

  E'LIS
     Usually seven.

  TUCKER
     Seven? You've got them outnumbered nine or ten to
     one.

  TESSIC
     You've never seen a Klingon in battle, have you?
     We tried to stand up to them once, three seasons
     ago. Five of us died fighting them. Then they
     killed three more to prove their point.

  E'LIS
     (holding Q'ell) One of them was his father.

  ARCHER
     Maybe there's something we can do.

  TESSIC
     Just take your two hundred litres and go. If
     you're here when they come back, they'll kill you.

  ARCHER
     Mister Reed.

  REED [OC]
     The Klingon ship's gone to warp, sir. I'm sending
     a shuttlepod down.

  ARCHER
     We'll be at the landing site.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker sees Q'ell looking wistfully after him.

  TUCKER
     I'll catch up with you later, Captain. Sorry I
     never got to give you that tour.

  Q'ELL
     I once saw a Kellenite ship with cannons and
     torpedoes.

  TUCKER
     Most big ships carry weapons.

  Q'ELL
     Like Enterprise.

  TUCKER
     Yeah, like Enterprise.

  Q'ELL
     You could have fought the Klingons. Beaten them.

  TUCKER
     Maybe.

  Q'ELL
     Why didn't you try?

  TUCKER
     It's not that simple.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  T'POL
     The deuterium's been stowed. Two hundred litres.
     Should I instruct Ensign Mayweather to break
     orbit?

  ARCHER
     So that's it? We just take our deuterium and
     leave? They work their asses off to provide for
     their families and then the Klingons just stroll
     in and rob them blind. Does that seem right to
     you? Malcolm tells me that Klingon ship isn't much
     more than a freighter. I'd lay odds they're no
     match for Enterprise.

  T'POL
     And if they withdraw? What will keep them from
     coming back after we've gone?

  ARCHER
     We could try to contact the Klingon High Council.
     We saved Klaang from the Suliban, we pulled one of
     their battle cruisers out of a gas giant. I say
     they owe us a favour.

  T'POL
     I doubt these marauders answer to the High
     Council.

  ARCHER
     I already know where Vulcans stand on interfering
     with other cultures but this isn't a culture.
     Seventy six settlers are being preyed upon. If
     this were an Earth colony I'd be grateful if
     someone showed up to give me a hand.

  T'POL
     Captain, this may surprise you, but I agree.
     However, short of killing the Klingons any action
     we take will only make the situation worse.

  ARCHER
     I just hate the idea of turning our backs.

  ANNOTATION
     It's nighttime, and Tessic is working on a
     machine.

  ARCHER
     Need a hand?

  TESSIC
     Control arm is jammed. I could use some help with
     the release valve.

  ARCHER
     Okay.

  TESSIC
     Turn it to the left.

  ARCHER
     This one?

  TESSIC
     Thought you'd be off charting your next start
     system by now.

  ARCHER
     Sometimes I have a bad habit of overstaying my
     welcome.

  TESSIC
     You obviously didn't come down here in the middle
     of the night to help me with this crawler.

  ARCHER
     Seems to me this crawler's the least of your
     problems.

  TESSIC
     We've been through this before. It's not your
     concern. Give it another turn.

  ARCHER
     You said they've been coming here for what, five
     seasons? How much longer do you plan on letting
     this go on? Another five?

  TESSIC
     That's good. Leave it there. Reconnect this
     coolant line. Intake's above your head.

  ARCHER
     I had a talk with my tactical officer. We're
     confident you have the ability to defend
     yourselves.

  TESSIC
     We already tried. There are eight people buried
     not far from here who can attest to that.

  ARCHER
     It would be different this time. We would help you
     prepare.

  TESSIC
     I don't want your help. I'm responsible for my
     people, not you. They put their trust in me. They
     depend on me. I'm supposed to protect them! Look
     at me I can barely keep this crawler running. You
     say you and your tactical officer want to help us.
     Even if you do once you're gone, we'll be alone
     again waiting for them to come back.

  ARCHER
     There's a saying on my world. Give a man a fish
     and he eats for a day. Teach him to fish, and he
     eats for a lifetime.


LOCATION--Inside a module

  ANNOTATION
     A table has been laid out with an assortment of
     weaponry.

  REED
     I was hoping for a bit more to work with.

  MAKLII
     They do a decent job keeping the shib'a lizards
     from chewing on the power couplings.

  REED
     With a few modifications these should be effective
     against more than lizards.

  MAKLII
     You must have a well stocked armoury onboard
     Enterprise.

  REED
     But this battle won't be won with firepower.
     Deception and surprise can be just as potent as
     brute force.

  T'POL
     Klingons are aggressive warriors but their tactics
     are crude. They're slow to adapt to changing
     circumstances.

  TESSIC
     This all sounds very ambitious. What exactly are
     you expecting us to do?

  ARCHER
     You're going to lure them into a trap.

  TESSIC
     What kind of trap?

  TUCKER
     A very hot one. The deuterium in those wellheads,
     how much pressure is it under? Three, four
     thousand millibars?

  MAKLII
     Five.

  TUCKER
     Should create some interesting fireworks.

  TESSIC
     You'll never get the Klingons near that deuterium
     field. They know it isn't safe.

  MAKLII
     They may be crude, but they're not fools.

  ARCHER
     That's where deception and surprise come in. Did
     you bring the map I asked you for?

  TESSIC
     It's right here.

  ARCHER
     The structures in the colony, they're mostly
     modular, right?

  TESSIC
     They're all modular. Most deuterium fields are
     depleted within three or four years at most. It
     forces us to be itinerant.

  ARCHER
     So you're saying you could relocate these
     buildings in a relatively short time.

  MAKLII
     It depends where you're suggesting we relocate
     them.

  ARCHER
     About fifty metres to the south, right here.

  TESSIC
     What good would that do? The terrain there is no
     different than where the town is now.

  TUCKER
     That's what we're counting on. If we can move the
     structures and the rigs, everything should look
     pretty much like it did yesterday.

  MAKLII
     Everything except the well-heads.

  ARCHER
     They'll have to be capped off, and camouflaged.

  TESSIC
     We can do that.

  REED
     The gullies on this hillside, are they deep enough
     to hide in?

  TESSIC
     If you keep your head down.

  T'POL
     We'll shuttle small groups to Enterprise for
     whatever training we have time for. Preferably
     people who have experience with weapons.

  ARCHER
     We've got three days. We should get to work.

  TESSIC
     What are we waiting for?

  ANNOTATION

  ANNOTATION
     She goes over to Maklii.

  HOSHI
     I can see your finger tensing on the trigger
     before you fire. It's throwing off your aim. I
     used to make the same mistake. Keep your eye on

  ANNOTATION
     Three men, a woman and Travis are attending the
     defence class.

  T'POL
     Klingons carry disrupters but they prefer to use
     bladed weapons in combat. The two most common
     being the bat'leth, a curved, bilateral sword and
     the mek'leth, a two-pronged dagger. The bat'leth
     can decapitate its victim with one stroke while
     the mek'leth is typically used to slash the throat
     or disembowel. I cannot teach you to defend
     yourselves against these weapons. The Vulcan
     martial art, Suus Mahna, takes years to master.
     However, I can teach you a simple evasive
     technique. Ensign Mayweather.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol picks up a piece of pipe.

  T'POL
     Since I don't have a bat'leth, this will have to
     suffice.

  TUCKER
     He doesn't want you to get hurt.

  Q'ELL
     But I want to help. I can shoot a shib'a lizard
     from forty metres.

  TUCKER
     Malcolm's got this rule. You've got to be taller
     than the gun to use it.

  Q'ELL
     I don't want to hide.

  TUCKER
     Shooting at a lizard is a whole lot different than
     shooting at a person, and lizards don't shoot
     back. When those Klingons show up I want you to do
     exactly what Lieutenant Reed says. Understood?

  Q'ELL

     Spacedock for three days when we found ourselves
     in a full-fledged firefight with some pretty nasty
     characters called the Suliban. I got shot in the
     leg. Just before I passed out I remembered
     thinking this isn't what I signed up for. I should
     be mapping star clusters or making first contact
     with friendly species. But when those Suliban
     started firing at my crew I knew I didn't have any
     choice but to fight back. I'm not ashamed to admit
     I was nervous. I'm nervous now. But I know we can

     him out with a pipe. Tessic also uses the evasion
     technique, then T'Pol wades in.

  T'POL
     Hey!

  ANNOTATION
     As her feet connect with the Klingon's face,
     several times. She knocks him out and they leave
     the scene.

  T'POL
     Come on.

  KLINGON 1
     There.

  ANNOTATION
     He aims his weapon at Maklii in amongst the pumps.

  KOROK
     What are you doing? You'll kill us all. Those
     wellheads, they're under great pressure. If you
     ignite them you'll incinerate the entire town.

  ANNOTATION
     Maklii runs away

  KLINGON 1
     They're making fools of us.

  ANNOTATION
     Korok finally uses his binoculars.

  KOROK
     They're hiding in the dirt like Targ. They'll
     learn to show us respect. We'll kill another four.
     Perhaps the boy as well.

  ANNOTATION
     As the Klingons march towards the gullies where
     the fighters are concealed

  T'POL
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     They're too far south.

  REED
     We've got to get them to move fifty metres to our
     left.

  ARCHER
     Everybody, this way.

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingons spot them moving, and some throw down
     their bat'leths to draw their disruptors.

  REED
     A little farther. This is good.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer watches Korok advance on a pile of stones.

  ARCHER
     A few more metres.

  ANNOTATION
     Korok's hobnails connect with metal in the ground,
     and he finally takes note of the landscape.

  KOROK
     This shouldn't be here.

  ARCHER
     Now.

  ANNOTATION
     Trip sets off his charges and the Klingons are
     surrounded by a circle of fire.

  ARCHER
     They're all yours, Tessic.

  TESSIC
     Korok!

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingons aim their disruptors at him.

  TESSIC
     I wouldn't do that. There's two more wellheads by
     your feet. Leave here now or we'll ignite them.

  KOROK
     P'taQ. You'll live to regret this.

  TESSIC
     If you're thinking about coming back, I wouldn't
     advise it. We'll be ready. We're not afraid of you
     anymore.

  ANNOTATION
     Korok holsters his weapon.

  KOROK
     We can find deuterium anywhere. Yours isn't fit
     for a garbage scow.

  ANNOTATION
     He speaks into his communicator and the party is
     beamed away. The colonists rejoice at their
     victory.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     Unless you're planning to join Starfleet I'm
     afraid you'll have to give up that chair.

  Q'ELL
     I wish you didn't have to leave.

  TUCKER
     Yeah, that's one of the tough things about my job.
     Saying goodbye to people like you and your
     friends. Oh, almost forgot.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets a PADD out of a case.

  TUCKER
     Schematics for Enterprise. You said you like to
     look at starships. This one'll knock your socks
     off.

  Q'ELL
     Thanks. Do you think you'll come back?

  TUCKER
     Who knows? Our engines need a lot of deuterium.


LOCATION--Settlement

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is cleaned up and back in proper desert
     uniform.

  ARCHER
     There must be over a thousand litres here.

  MAKLII
     Two thousand.

  ARCHER
     Our deal was for two hundred.

  TESSIC
     Our deal was for power cells, medical supplies and
     repair work. You provided us with much more than
     that.

  MAKLII
     Besides, we seem to have a surplus at the moment.

  ANNOTATION
     Q'ell runs out to join them.

  MAKLII
     Give your crew our thanks.

  ARCHER
     Have a good season.

  ANNOTATION
     They get into the shuttlepod and fly off, leaving
     the deuterium behind.
