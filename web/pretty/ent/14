<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Just over three billion humanoids. Apparently, the Vulcans have a mining agreement with them. I had Hoshi send a message to their Chancellor and she invited us to visit their capital city.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ARCHER:  I think I'll just take Hoshi, this time. The Chancellor asked me to limit the number of people I bring down until they get to know us better.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>ARCHER:  It's really too bad. According to the database, they've got the largest starship construction yards in the sector. They're supposed to have ships that can run circles around the Vulcans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>FORREST [on monitor]:  Jon, you're doing a lot of good work, but you've got to be more careful. Earth can't be getting involved in inter-species conflicts.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>ARCHER:  The High Command is looking for a scapegoat, someone to blame. They can't punish me so they're taking it out on my science officer. Sounds like an emotional reaction, if you ask me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Don't give yourself too much credit. I was the one who found P'Jem in the database, and I led the landing party. I want you to know I'm filing a protest with the High Command.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>PHLOX:  I'm certain the High Command would reconsider your transfer if they knew everything you've done for this crew. You realise you're not the first Vulcan officer to be posted aboard a human starship. The High Command has tried this before but none of the others lasted more than a few weeks. They found their crewmates too chaotic and unpredictable. But you've been here more than six months and you haven't merely tolerated this crew, you've become part of it. Isn't it logical to take pride in that accomplishment?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>PHLOX:  I suppose it is. Oh, I have it on good authority that several crewmembers are planning a gathering in your honour. I believe it's called a going-away party. I'd keep on alert if I were you.</td></tr>
