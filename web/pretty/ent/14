Shadows of P'Jem
TEASER

LOCATION--Captain's mess

  TUCKER
     I noticed we changed course overnight.

  ARCHER
     I found a new system in the Vulcan database.
     Coridan. They're only a few light years away so I
     thought we'd take a look.

  TUCKER
     Inhabited?

  ARCHER
     Just over three billion humanoids. Apparently, the
     Vulcans have a mining agreement with them. I had
     Hoshi send a message to their Chancellor and she
     invited us to visit their capital city.

  TUCKER
     Then I'll start shining my boots.

  ARCHER
     I think I'll just take Hoshi, this time. The
     Chancellor asked me to limit the number of people
     I bring down until they get to know us better.

  TUCKER
     Oh.

  ARCHER
     It's really too bad. According to the database,
     they've got the largest starship construction
     yards in the sector. They're supposed to have
     ships that can run circles around the Vulcans.

  TUCKER
     Better than six five?

  ARCHER
     They say some Coridan ships have reached warp
     seven, but that's just a rumour.

  TUCKER
     Warp seven?

  ARCHER
     You should lend Hoshi your camera. I'll be sure
     she takes lots of pictures.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer finally cracks and grins.

  TUCKER
     You had me going there for a minute.

  ARCHER
     You're just too easy a target.

  TUCKER
     So you're taking me, right?

  HOSHI [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Archer.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  HOSHI [OC]
     I'm receiving a transmission from Starfleet
     Command. It's Admiral Forrest, sir.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Was anyone killed?

  FORREST [on monitor]
     The Andorians gave the monks three hours before
     they started their bombardment. Fortunately, they
     all got out in time.

  ARCHER
     How are the Vulcans taking this?

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Not well.

  ARCHER
     I can't really blame the Andorians for reacting
     this way.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Jon.

  ARCHER
     If the roles were reversed the Vulcans might have
     done the same thing.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     The Vulcans may have good reason for keeping an
     eye on them. I've seen the reports. These Andorian
     commandos are a dangerous group.

  ARCHER
     That's the same crap the Vulcans used to say about
     us.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Jon, you're doing a lot of good work, but you've
     got to be more careful. Earth can't be getting
     involved in inter-species conflicts.

  ARCHER
     I understand.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     I'm afraid I've got some more bad news.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Archer is staring out of the window when
     the door bell sounds.

  ARCHER
     Come in. Have a seat.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol sits.

  ARCHER
     I just spoke with Admiral Forrest. There's no easy
     way to say this. The Andorians destroyed the
     sanctuary at P'Jem.

  T'POL
     Were there any survivors?

  ARCHER
     Fortunately, the monks and the intelligence
     operatives were given advance warning. They're
     fine.

  T'POL
     Was there time to remove any of the relics?

  ARCHER
     I don't know. The High Command believes we're to
     blame for this. They're sending a ship to take you
     back to Vulcan. It'll be here in two days.

  T'POL
     I won't have time to complete my scans of this
     sector. I'll ask Ensign Mayweather to finish them.

  ARCHER
     Maybe I wasn't clear. This isn't a temporary
     transfer. They're reassigning you.

  T'POL
     I understand the situation, Captain. I'm certain
     the High Command will find you a suitable
     replacement.

  ARCHER
     Am I the only one who has a problem with this?
     Because you seem perfectly fine.

  T'POL
     My assignment to the Enterprise was only supposed
     to last eight days. It was unrealistic to expect
     it to continue indefinitely.

  ARCHER
     The High Command is looking for a scapegoat,
     someone to blame. They can't punish me so they're
     taking it out on my science officer. Sounds like
     an emotional reaction, if you ask me.

  T'POL
     I am largely responsible for what happened.

  ARCHER
     Don't give yourself too much credit. I was the one
     who found P'Jem in the database, and I led the
     landing party. I want you to know I'm filing a
     protest with the High Command.

  T'POL
     That won't make any difference.

  ARCHER
     You don't know that.

  T'POL
     Captain, I was assigned to Enterprise not simply
     as an observer, but to represent the interests of
     the Vulcan people. It's clear in the eyes of my
     superiors I haven't done that.

  ARCHER
     They have no right to do this to you. You're a
     part of my crew.

  T'POL
     For another forty eight hours. Was there anything
     else?

  ARCHER
     No.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUCKER
     This is just another part of the joke, right?

  ARCHER
     Sorry, Trip, but I've got to take T'Pol on this
     one. I need to spend some time with her alone.
