<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>ARCHER:  It's been a long time since any Xindi took orders from you. We're carrying five hundred litres of warp plasma in the starboard tanks. We'll have to vent it. Turn these down on my mark. They're going to destroy us. Now!</td></tr>

Whatever the insectoids did to you in there must have affected your memory. My name is Jonathan Archer. The two of us just escaped from an insectoid prison colony.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Probably because of the bloodworms.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>DEGRA:  Bloodworms?</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>ARCHER:  They're used during interrogations. Their secretions act as a truth serum, makes the prisoners more co-operative. But there's a side effect. Sometimes they can suppress memories. The same thing happened when they questioned me. I forgot everything that happened since flight school. It'll start to come back to you. Give it a few days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>DEGRA:  You claim that I've been a prisoner for three years.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>ARCHER:  They wanted information about the weapon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>DEGRA:  I was on my vessel, approaching the planet in the Calindra system.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>ARCHER:  The weapons test. It failed because your prototype was sabotaged.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>DEGRA:  How would you know that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Because I'm responsible for it. Your kemocite shipment was tampered with.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>DEGRA:  Gralik.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>ARCHER:  He wasn't too happy when I told him what you were planning to do with his kemocite.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>DEGRA:  He'll be executed for this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>ARCHER:  He was. In the end it didn't make much of a difference. We didn't stop your programme, we only slowed it down. A few weeks later the weapon was launched. It destroyed my planet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>DEGRA:  We were successful?</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>ARCHER:  I don't know if you'd call it a success. After Earth was destroyed the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again. The insectoids started attacking other Xindi colonies. They killed thousands of your people.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>DEGRA:  The reptilians and aquatics would never allow that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>ARCHER:  There wasn't a lot they could do. While you were busy constructing the weapon, the insectoids were secretly building hundreds of new ships. They used Earth as a diversion. Their real goal was to dominate the other Xindi species. Are you all right?</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Something moves under the skin of Degra's forearm.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>ARCHER:  It's just a bloodworm. It'll work its was out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>DEGRA:  Can you remove it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Archer rummages in a couple of lockers and finds a knife and a glass vial.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Hold still.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Archer cuts into Degra's arm, pulls out the six inch long worm and puts it in the vial. Putting things away again afterwards, he finds a bottle of something.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>ARCHER:  I think you need this more than I do. Suit yourself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He takes a swig.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>DEGRA:  I don't understand how a Xindi and a human could put aside their differences so quickly.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Trust me, it didn't happen overnight.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He points at to scar on his forehead.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>ARCHER:  You gave me this the first day we were locked up together. The guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell. They even placed wagers on who would survive the longest. I was in pretty bad shape at the time so you were the odds-on favourite. Your people killed everyone I ever cared about. I was going to make sure you never walked out of that cell. For weeks we tried to kill each other. I was lying in the infirmary when I finally asked myself, what was the point. My world was gone, but so was yours. So I made a proposal. The two of us would work together to get out of that place. Took us longer than either one of us thought, but here we are.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>DEGRA:  I don't recognise this type of ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>ARCHER:  It's a Malosian cargo shuttle.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>DEGRA:  Malosian.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ARCHER:  They're traders. They bring supplies to the prison a few times a month. No weapons, but she's sturdy enough to get us where we're going.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>DEGRA:  Perhaps we should set a course to your vessel. Is it still in the Expanse?</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Not exactly. When we were getting close to finding your weapon the insectoids sent their ships after us. They boarded Enterprise and took me prisoner, then they planted spatial charges around our warp reactor. My crew was still aboard when they detonated them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>DEGRA:  The insectoids were always the aggressive species, but I never thought them capable of this. They destroyed everything the Council worked for.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>ARCHER:  The Council?</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>DEGRA:  It was formed when our planet was destroyed. It was created to find a new home world for all Xindi. After years of searching we found a few suitable locations, but as usual couldn't agree on a final choice. Our plan for reunification was put aside when we learned of the threat from Earth. I was ordered to begin designing the weapon. I devoted years to it. I made so many sacrifices. So did my wife. Do I know what happened to my family?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ARCHER:  You told me you'd heard from Naara before you were sent to prison. She and the children were safe. We have a ship now. We can look for them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>DEGRA:  They were on a colony near a red giant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>ARCHER:  There's nothing in range. Do you remember the coordinates?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>DEGRA:  I doubt if there's anything left. It would have been one of the first colonies to be attacked.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>ARCHER:  There may have been survivors.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>DEGRA:  It's too dangerous. Patrol ships are still looking for us. We should find a refuge in case.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: There's a hiss, and green gas starts coming into the cabin.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Reactor coolant. The conduit must have ruptured in the attack. Take it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: The only oxygen mask.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>DEGRA:  What about you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>ARCHER:  You're the one with a family. You want to see them again? Try to seal the rupture. I'll see if I can close off the coolant tanks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Archer collapses as Degra seals the gash with a mini welder. Once he's done it, he shares the oxygen with Archer as the air clears. Later, as Degra sleeps, Archer gets a hypospray from its hiding place and injects him.</td></tr>
