<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>DEGRA:  You know Jannar, the arboreal. He's fair-minded, a scientist, he'll listen to the facts. I count him as a friend. Unfortunately the other members are somewhat more complicated. The aquatics for instance. Kiaphet Amman'sor is a member of the Ibix dynasty, a very wealthy, very powerful family. Her opinions carry considerable weight when she arrives at them. There's a saying. It's easier to count the stars in the sky than it is for an aquatic to reach a decision. As for the insectoids, well, their names grow longer the older they get, so they become a little difficult to pronounce. In many ways insectoids are the opposite of the aquatics.</td></tr>

His daughter gave birth to a son. He had a deformity in his right arm, not life-threatening but enough to preclude his ever joining the military. Commander Dolim had his own grandson poisoned.</td></tr>
