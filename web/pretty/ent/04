But it wasn't a ship that sent the signal. It was a life-pod from one of the old Y-500-class freighters.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>TRAVIS:  Exactly. The pod had been drifting in space for sixty three years. Bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod. Human. The assistant engineer, George Webb, a friend of my uncle's, was assigned to open it. Took him over an hour to cut through the hull. He said the metal felt strange, cold to the touch.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>TRAVIS:  He could hear a tapping noise coming from inside, but when he finally got it open the pod was empty. No body, nothing. A few days later, Webb started acting strange, getting into fights with the crew, muttering to himself in some sort of alien language. Then one day he locked himself in Engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors. He almost destroyed the ship. Then he sealed himself in a life pod and ejected it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>TRAVIS:  The reactors were too badly damaged. Some people say it was an alien life form that got into him, others think it was the ghost of a dead crewman. I never knew what to believe, but Webb is still out there, drifting. When the subspace noise is real low, some comm. officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call. Beep, Beep.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: All laugh.</td></tr>
