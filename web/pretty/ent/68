On Earth, a dog called Scruffers travelled three thousand kilometres attempting to reunite with it's human keeper. I heard of a Pycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return to it's home world, but I don't believe it had a name. I could use a walk. How about you?</td></tr>

It's unfortunate you were forced to cut your time on Denobula short, but obviously you're needed on Earth. Perhaps when our mission is successfully completed I'll see you back in San Francisco. The Expanse. An extremely curious place.</td></tr>
