LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker wakes up. He is wearing blue singlet and
     shorts.

  TUCKER
     Doc, isn't my time up yet? You said twenty
     minutes.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TUCKER [OC]
     It's been at least an hour. I'm getting a little
     well-done in here. Doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     But Phlox is spark out on the floor.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  TUCKER
     Hello?

  ANNOTATION
     He tries the door, then uses the panel to short
     out the lock and leave. He discovers the
     unconscious crewmen in the corridors and
     turbolift. At the airlock, Ulis and Grish put a
     ramp over the door lip and wheel trolleys onto
     Enterprise/


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker finds Phlox, then hears voices approaching
     and hides.

  MUK
     Sel treoght da-techt.

  KREM
     Ehj ocuuz sahfi?

  MUK
     Guzah louz.

  ANNOTATION
     The pair start stuffing sacks with medical
     supplies. Krem looks in one of Phlox's cages and
     yelps,

  MUK
     La ruvah tahp!

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker watches from the top of an access ladder.
     As the looters make their way through the ship,
     Tucker keeps watch. In a corridor, he watches as
     Ulis wheels a torpedo along on his trolley. On the
     Bridge, Ulis even strips off the dedication plaque
     from the wall. In Engineering, Krem strokes
     T'Pol's face then drags her away. Grish even takes
     Travis's chair. Krem raids the mess hall, doesn't
     like the smell of salad but takes desserts. Muk
     swaps his boots for some found in a cupboard. Iin
     the Launch bay, it looks like they've taken all
     the women they've found, not just T'Pol but also
     Hoshi and others. Tucker makes it to his desk in
     Engineering and watches on a monitor as Archer is
     lifted out of his chair and carried away.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ULIS
     Ingala habi.

  ANNOTATION
     Grish injects Archer and he wakes up, handcuffed
     to a stanchion.

  ARCHER
     Who are you?

  ULIS
     Ingala duk habi?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem cautiously holds out a translator while Muk
     has a rifle.

  ARCHER
     I don't understand.

  ULIS
     Duk habi nakustra?

  ARCHER
     What?

  ULIS
     Bok, megoron duk what I'm saying?

  MUK
     Sit down!

  ARCHER
     Who the hell are you?

  ULIS
     Who we are is unimportant. Do you command this
     ship?

  ARCHER
     I'm the captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer sees the women.

  ARCHER
     What have you done to my crew?

  ULIS
     They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as
     you cooperate.

  ARCHER
     What do you want?

  ULIS
     Where is the location of your vault?

  ARCHER
     Vault? I don't know what you're talking about.

  KREM
     Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.

  ULIS
     He understands.

  ARCHER
     This is a vessel of exploration not a cargo ship.
     We don't do any commerce. Whatever it is you're
     after, you won't find it here.

  ULIS
     You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious
     gems, no latinum?

  ARCHER
     I just told you.

  MUK
     Liar!

  ANNOTATION
     Muk hits Archer.

  ARCHER
     Whoever you are, just take what you want and get
     off of my ship.

  KREM
     Cousin, maybe we should. We've made some good
     acquisitions already.

  MUK
     There's more here. He's hiding something.

  GRISH
     I agree with Krem. Let's take what we have and go.

  ULIS
     What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer spots Tucker watching from above.

  ULIS
     Nothing but trinkets.

  KREM
     Don't forget about the females. Some of them are
     worth their weight in latinum. If we leave now we
     can make the next slave market on Stameris.

  ARCHER
     Slave market?

  ULIS
     You're right, Krem. Pick out the females that will
     bring the best price.

  KREM
     I already have.

  ULIS
     It was a pleasure doing business with you.

  ARCHER
     Wait.

  ULIS
     You've reconsidered?

  ARCHER
     I'll show you where the vault is, if you let me
     keep half the gold.

  ULIS
     Gold-pressed latinum?

  ARCHER
     Gold bars. Hundreds of them. But I keep half.

  ULIS
     Ten percent.

  ARCHER
     Forty.

  ULIS
     Fifteen.

  ARCHER
     Thirty five and not a bar less. You'll never find
     the vault without my help.

  ULIS
     Twenty percent. Final offer.

  ARCHER
     No deal. I'd rather you take the women and go.

  GRISH
     Thirty-five percent. That's not a bad offer, Ulis.
     Maybe we should consider it.

  ULIS
     No. We'll find the vault ourselves. Krem, start
     loading the merchandise.

  KREM
     Why am I always stuck doing the menial labour?

  ULIS
     Make him do it.

  ANNOTATION
     Muk gives Krem the rifle and the other three
     leave.


LOCATION--Alien cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Compared with the Launch bay, it's tiny. Krem has
     Archer lugging boxes. His overalls are tied around
     his waist.

  KREM
     Oh, not there. Over here.

  ARCHER
     If you're going to make a habit out of this, you
     might want to get a bigger ship.

  KREM
     It's not my ship. It's my cousin's.

  ARCHER
     Really. I was getting the impression you were in
     charge.

  KREM
     This is only my first month on the job.

  ARCHER
     How do you like it so far?

  KREM
     My cousin's a skillful merchant. I'm learning a
     lot from him. You'd better slide that over to make
     room for the others.

  ARCHER
     What do you need all this for, anyway? You seem to
     already have plenty of technology.

  KREM
     One can never have too much. The Rules of
     Acquisition say 'Expand or die'.

  ARCHER
     Rules of Acquisition?

  KREM
     That's rule number forty five. I've memorised all
     a hundred and seventy three, including the most
     important one. A man is only worth the sum of his
     possessions.

  ARCHER
     Back on my home world that kind of thinking almost
     destroyed our civilisation.

  KREM
     You should've managed your businesses better. Come
     on. We have a lot more moving to do.

  ARCHER
     We?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     There are those handy ramps over all the bulkhead
     door edges.

  ARCHER
     So what do you do, split the profits equally
     between the four of you?

  KREM
     Oh, my cousin determines the shares.

  ARCHER
     You must get a bigger percentage than your
     crewmates.

  KREM
     Actually, I get the smallest.

  ARCHER
     Oh, that doesn't seem fair. You're the one doing
     all the work.

  KREM
     My cousin knows what's best for me. He manages all
     my financial transactions.

  ARCHER
     Really.

  KREM
     I don't have the lobes for business.

  ARCHER
     I assume he charges you for his services.

  KREM
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer spots Trip hiding around a corner.

  KREM
     He wouldn't be a very good businessman if he
     didn't. Never allow family to stand in the way of
     profit.

  ARCHER
     Another one of your rules?

  KREM
     Number six. My cousin's going to help me acquire
     my own ship some day.

  ARCHER
     (coughing) Do you think you could bring me a glass
     of water?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem handcuffs him to a handrail.

  ARCHER
     It comes out of a dispenser in the mess hall.

  KREM
     I'll be right back.

  ARCHER
     Oh, do you think you could bring me some food
     while you're at it? Whatever's left in the serving
     case. That is, if you haven't already taken
     everything.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem heads off and Trip dashes over to try and
     free him.

  TUCKER
     You all right, Captain?

  ARCHER
     Never better. You?

  TUCKER
     From what I can tell, you and I are the only ones
     on the ship still standing. I would've tried to
     wake some of the others but there's nothing left
     in Sickbay to do it with.

  ARCHER
     I'm not surprised. These aliens are taking
     everything they can get their hands on.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker fails to undo the handcuffs.

  TUCKER
     Who are they?

  ARCHER
     I don't know yet. Can you get a phase pistol?

  TUCKER
     They've cleaned out the armoury.

  ARCHER
     There are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship.
     They can't have emptied every one of them.

  TUCKER
     Trust me, Captain, I've already checked.

  ARCHER
     I've got an idea, but you're going to need some
     help to pull it off. They used a hypospray to wake
     me up. It's in Launch bay two. (Krem returns with
     a glass of water and half eaten sandwich.)

  KREM
     This is pretty good.

  ARCHER
     Glad you're enjoying it.

  KREM
     Maybe we should take your cook with us.

  ARCHER
     Do you mind?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem puts the glass and food into Archer's hands
     while he hunts for the handcuff keys.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker finds the hypospray and injects T'Pol, then
     Hoshi.

  T'POL
     Commander.

  TUCKER
     You're going to be fine. Just because a guy's in
     his underwear you think the worst.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi isn't waking up.

  T'POL
     I assume you have an explanation.

  TUCKER
     Doctor Phlox made me clear bio-scan after I got
     back from that lunar survey. While I was in decon,
     something knocked out the entire crew. Aliens are
     in control of the ship.

  T'POL
     That artefact you brought back from the lunar
     surface. It must have been placed there
     intentionally. When I opened it, the canister
     released some kind of gas.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, T'Pol lies down again and Trip
     hides.

  KREM
     This female is different from the others. What
     species is she?

  ARCHER
     She's a Vulcan.

  KREM
     Vulcan.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer wheels a cabinet away.
