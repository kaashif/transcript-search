Singularity
TEASER

LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  T'POL
     I'm continuing my analysis of the condition that's
     stricken the crew. Without Doctor Phlox's
     assistance I'm not hopeful about reversing its
     effects. I'm documenting my findings so that
     Starfleet will at least have a record of what
     happened. The symptoms began not long after we set
     a course for the trinary system. That was nearly
     two days ago.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ARCHER
     You're sure it's a black hole?

  T'POL
     A class four.

  ARCHER
     According to the Vulcan star charts, your people
     have surveyed more than two thousand of these
     things.

  T'POL
     That's correct, but none of them were part of a
     trinary star system.

  ARCHER
     How close can we get?

  T'POL
     The gravitational shear between the stars is
     extreme. We'd have to drop to impulse, but we
     should be able to approach to within five million
     kilometres.

  TUCKER
     Close enough to get some nice pictures.

  ARCHER
     How long would it take to reach the system at
     impulse?

  T'POL
     Two days.

  ARCHER
     Set a course.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol leaves them.

  ARCHER
     Trip. If you've got some free time, I'd love it if
     you take a look at my chair.

  TUCKER
     Sir?

  ARCHER
     The Captain's chair.

  TUCKER
     Wh-What about it?
