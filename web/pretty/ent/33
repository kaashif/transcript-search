Three years in a Vulcan clinic. Rehabilitation. Can you blame me for running? I'm not a thief. I'm not a smuggler. I never was. I worked with smugglers. I worked very close with them for a long time. It's what I had been trained to do. Do you know how I've survived the last twenty years? How I've fed my family? I haul spent warp injector casings. Not a very popular occupation, but a necessary one. A doctor on Andoria says that my hemolytic cell count is over three thousand. You don't find too many old men hauling spent injector casings. In my left front pocket, if you don't mind.</td></tr>
