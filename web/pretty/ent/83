The Forge
TEASER

LOCATION--United Earth Embassy

  SOVAL
     Admiral, the High Command will tell you its
     decision at the proper time.

  FORREST
     After all we've been through, I'd rather hear the
     good news from you.

  SOVAL
     The High Command hasn't included me in their
     discussions.

  FORREST
     They're not telling their own Ambassador to Earth
     what they're planning? Welcome to the club.

  SOVAL
     Admiral, I know you find our reluctance to share
     technology and discoveries restrictive.

  FORREST
     I can think of a few stronger words than that.

  SOVAL
     We don't know what to do about humans. Of all the
     species we've made contact with, yours is the only
     one we can't define. You have the arrogance of
     Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One
     moment, you're as driven by your emotions as
     Klingons, and the next, you confound us by
     suddenly embracing logic.
