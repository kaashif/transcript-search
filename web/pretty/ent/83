<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>FORREST:  They're not telling their own Ambassador to Earth what they're planning? Welcome to the club.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>SOVAL:  Admiral, I know you find our reluctance to share technology and discoveries restrictive.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>FORREST:  I can think of a few stronger words than that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>SOVAL:  We don't know what to do about humans. Of all the species we've made contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have the arrogance of Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One moment, you're as driven by your emotions as Klingons, and the next, you confound us by suddenly embracing logic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>FORREST : I'm sure those qualities are found in every species.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>SOVAL:  Because there is one species you remind us of.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>SOVAL:  We had our wars, Admiral, just as humans did. Our planet was devastated, our civilisation nearly destroyed. Logic saved us. But it took almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world and travel to the stars. You humans did the same in less than a century. There are those on the High Command who wonder what humans would achieve in the century to come, and they don't like the answer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>FORREST:  We're not the Klingons. We only want to be your partners. To do what the nations of Earth have learned to do. To work together in common cause.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>SOVAL:  Unfortunately, the future of relations between our worlds is not mine to control.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: There's a dull thud sound. Max looks back then suddenly grabs Soval and pushes him to the floor as the dust from an explosion billows towards them and the building starts to fall apart. Then there is a second explosion, and the top of the Embassy is blown off.</td></tr>

Three days after the bombing of Earth's embassy, the death toll stands at forty three, and I have lost my friend, Admiral Forrest.

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>ARCHER:  So why would these Syrrannites want to attack our embassy? It's hardly an act of logic.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>STEL:  Over the past year their leader, a dissident named Syrran, has become a dangerous zealot.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>V'LAS:  Captain, I trust you to keep this matter confidential. We don't share it lightly. But recently, on our world, there have been instances of violence against non-Vulcans. Though we have no conclusive proof, there are signs that Syrrannites might be responsible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>ARCHER:  Is there any evidence connecting Syrrannites to the bombing?</td></tr>

If it detonates, we'll never know. Steady. There's Vulcan DNA on these controls. So much for blaming Andorians. Boosting scan resolution.</td></tr>

Archer walks to the third one in on the second row from the door and places his hands on it. The bay doors open and close again.</td></tr>
