You are both suspended from duty pending an inquiry, and by the time Starfleet Command gets through with you, you're going to wish that you had never come back. You're supposed to represent the best that Starfleet has to offer. Keeping this programme on track is hard enough without our own officers undermining it. What did you think that this stunt of yours would accomplish? That just because you didn't get yourselves killed that we'd ignore that data we've collected, the testing we've done, the recommendations of the Vulcan Advisory Council?</td></tr>

We didn't build this engine to make test runs around Jupiter. We built it to explore. If my father were alive today, he'd be standing here asking, what the hell are we waiting for?</td></tr>
