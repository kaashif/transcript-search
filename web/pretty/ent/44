The Crossing
TEASER

LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Tucker to the Bridge!

  ARCHER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  TUCKER
     What's going on, Captain? The engines just went
     down.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Warp or impulse?

  TUCKER
     Both.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Hold on, Trip. Have they dropped out of warp?

  T'POL
     There's no way to tell. Our sensors can't
     penetrate their hull.

  ARCHER
     What about our life support?

  T'POL
     Fully operational.

  ARCHER
     That's one piece of good news. Any biosigns out
     there?

  T'POL
     None that I can detect.

  ARCHER
     Rotate the dorsal camera.

  ANNOTATION
     The image is of a big chamber, and a circular
     object ahead of them.

  ARCHER
     Hold it there. Tilt up about thirty degrees. Get
     closer.

  ANNOTATION
     There are wispy things moving around.

  T'POL
     The vapour doesn't contain any elements our
     sensors can identify.

  ARCHER
     Any atmosphere?

  T'POL
     Mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon.

  ARCHER
     Prep a shuttlepod. Trip, meet me and Malcolm in
     Launch bay one.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  ARCHER
     (to T'Pol) You're in charge. Keep a channel open.


LOCATION--Alien spaceship

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlepod glides out of the bay down to the
     floor of the alien ship, then three space-suited
     figures climb out.

  REED
     Captain, look at this.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out a scanner.

  REED
     The atmosphere's changing. Seventy six percent
     nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen.

  TUCKER
     Somebody seems to know what we like to breathe.

  ARCHER
     What's the temperature?

  REED
     Eighteen degrees.

  TUCKER
     Florida in November.

  ARCHER
     Let's see what we can find.

  TUCKER
     Look at that.

  ANNOTATION
     The wisps are circling Enterprise.

  REED
     I'm not reading anything. It's like they're not
     there.

  TUCKER
     They sure look there to me.

  REED
     If there aren't any life-forms here, then who
     modified the atmosphere?

  ARCHER
     I doubt it's a coincidence.

  TUCKER
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Some light blue wisps swirl around them.

  ARCHER
     We may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those
     things sure look alive to me.

  ANNOTATION
     One of them gets into Tucker's head, then leaves
     again, coloured yellow.

  ARCHER
     Are you okay? Trip?

  ANNOTATION
     The yellow wisp returns, pops into his head and a
     white one leaves.

  TUCKER
     What the hell happened?

  ARCHER
     That's what I was about to ask you.

  TUCKER
     I think I was up on the ceiling with those things.
     I was looking down at the three of us, but not
     with my eyes. I can't explain it.

  ARCHER
     We should get him back to the ship.

  TUCKER
     I was in Tarpon Springs, too, swimming with Lisa.
     She was afraid it was getting too dark.

  REED
     It sounds like you were dreaming, Commander.

  TUCKER
     I know the difference between a dream and
     something really happening.

  ARCHER
     We're a hundred and fifty light years from Earth,
     Trip.

  TUCKER
     I'm telling you, I was there.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Trip is in the Decon chamber.

  PHLOX
     I'm not detecting any parasites or lifeforms or
     wisps of smoke. He seems in perfect working order.

  ARCHER
     He said he had some kind of out-of-body
     experience.

  TUCKER
     I don't forget Florida, Captain. I don't care how
     far away it is. I was there.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox cuts off the intercom.

  PHLOX
     It's a very common hallucination, returning to a
     familiar place.

  TUCKER
     What happened to the comm.? You three talking
     about me?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox switches the intercom back on.

  PHLOX
     You're clear, Commander. Free to go.

  TUCKER
     Thanks, Doc.


LOCATION--Locker room

  ANNOTATION
     Changing out of the space suits back into their
     uniforms.

  ARCHER
     You sure you're all right?

  TUCKER
     I'm fine. I can't believe how amazing it was.

  ARCHER
     I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay for a few days,
     but I can't afford to. I need you to get those
     engines back online.

  TUCKER
     I'll see what I can do.

  ARCHER
     Let me know if you take another trip to Tarpon
     Beach.

  TUCKER
     Tarpon Springs. I'll keep you posted.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves.

  ARCHER
     I want those weapons back online, too.

  REED
     I'll see what I can do.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol enters.

  ARCHER
     It's like we're in the belly of the beast.

  T'POL
     We have no reason to believe their motives are
     hostile.

  ARCHER
     They're holding my ship hostage.

  T'POL
     We don't know that.

  ARCHER
     We don't? Look out there. Do you see any stars?
     Our engines are offline, our weapons. Seems kind
     of hostile to me.

  T'POL
     I suppose it depends on how you look at it.

  ARCHER
     Is there something you wanted to see me about?

  T'POL
     Ensign Sato is trying to communicate with the life
     forms.

  ARCHER
     And?

  T'POL
     Nothing yet. I've spoken to a number of officers.
     They say the crew is concerned, but remaining
     calm.

  ARCHER
     I've got to get them out of here.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     A blue wisp enters Tucker, and a yellow one
     leaves.

  ROSTOV
     I tried re-initialising the plasma flow, but the
     power grid isn't charging. Commander? Are you all
     right, sir? Can I get you something?

  TUCKER
     I'm fine. Goodbye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves through a small hatch that another
     crewman just came out of.

  ROSTOV
     Rostov to Captain Archer.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ROSTOV
     I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I think there
     might be something wrong with Commander Tucker.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     What do you mean, wrong?


LOCATION--Engineering

  ROSTOV
     He was confused, and seemed to think I was his
     superior officer.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     I'll be right down.

  ROSTOV [OC]
     He's not here, sir. He left Engineering.

  ARCHER
     Did he say where he was going?


LOCATION--Engineering

  ROSTOV
     No, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ROSTOV [OC]
     I'm afraid not, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Commander Tucker. (to T'Pol) Find him.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     The Tucker thing has a table full of food in front
     of it when Archer, T'Pol and Reed enter.

  ARCHER
     Commander.

  TUCKER
     Commander Charles Tucker III.

  ARCHER
     Hungry?

  TUCKER
     Yes. It's all very good. Have you ever tried this?

  ARCHER
     It's called bread. You've never eaten it before?

  TUCKER
     I've never eaten anything before.

  T'POL
     Where's Commander Tucker?

  TUCKER
     I'm here. Charles Tucker III.

  ARCHER
     Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker?

  TUCKER
     He's exploring another realm. My realm. But he'll
     be back.

  ARCHER
     I want him back now.

  TUCKER
     Please trust me. He's experiencing things he never
     thought he could.

  ARCHER
     Where is he?

  TUCKER
     It's not a question of where. He's no longer
     corporeal. But he will be again, I assure you.

  REED
     When we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour
     penetrate him. Did you have anything to do with
     that?

  TUCKER
     Wisp. Interesting word. Wisp. Wisp. Yes, I suppose
     you could call us that. Wisp.

  ARCHER
     Where do you come from?

  TUCKER
     We live in subspace. We travel through it. We're
     explorers, like you.

  ARCHER
     Why did you take Commander Tucker?

  TUCKER
     It's been a long time since we've encountered
     corporeal beings. After we performed the first
     crossing with your commander, we realised we were
     compatible. You're very interesting. Trapped in
     bodies that need maintenance. You have gender. You
     require mates to reproduce. You eat food. We were
     like you once, but we evolved. Now we can learn
     how our ancestors lived.

  ARCHER
     I want my crewman, and I want my ship released.

  REED
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Through the porthole, we see the ship is moving.

  TUCKER
     Your crewman will be returned. You claim to be an
     explorer, Captain. Open your mind to new
     possibilities.

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is released into space.

  ARCHER
     What about Tucker?

  TUCKER
     I've enjoyed my time with you.

  REED
     Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A yellow wisp enters the Mess hall, then Tucker,
     and a blue one leaves.

  TUCKER
     Wow.

  ARCHER
     Wow what?

  TUCKER
     I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy
     chasing some bad guys. Then I was with Lisa again,
     except this time we were snow sailing in New
     Zealand. Then I was eight years old, maybe nine,
     picking up leaves with my dad. But it wasn't a
     dream, Captain. It was as real as I'm sitting
     here. They told me you can try it. Anyone on the
     crew.

  ARCHER
     Who told you?

  TUCKER
     They did. The ones I was with.

  ARCHER
     I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your
     girlfriend.

  TUCKER
     I was, but it's hard to explain. You should try
     it. You'll understand what I'm talking about. You
     all should try it.

  ARCHER
     Take him to Sickbay.

  TUCKER
     Captain, I'm fine.

  ARCHER
     We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are.

  REED
     Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Tucker leave.

  ARCHER
     Something smells funny.

  T'POL
     They've released the ship and Commander Tucker.
     They've done everything you've asked. Have you
     considered they may have been telling the truth
     when they said they were just curious about us?


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now that the
     Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my
     primary concern is to get Enterprise out of here.
     But Trip tells me it'll be awhile before he can
     get the engines online. From what we can tell,
     these life forms have no mass. Non-corporeal
     beings. that's got to be a first for Starfleet.
     T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us.
     Maybe she's right. Maybe I don't trust them
     because they're so different. I'd hate to think
     that was the case. (doorbell chime) Computer,
     pause. Come in.

  PHLOX
     I hope I'm not disturbing you.

  ARCHER
     Everything all right?

  PHLOX
     I'm not certain. One of those beings appeared in
     Sickbay a few minutes ago. It entered me right
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox indicates his forehead.

  PHLOX
     But my physiology must not have been compatible.
     It left almost immediately.

  ARCHER
     Are you sure you're all right?

  PHLOX
     I'm fine. But it was disturbing. The lifeform was
     trying very hard to reach me.

  ANNOTATION
     In the Armoury, Reed spots the reflection of a
     blue wisp in a fixture, and makes a dash for it.
     He tries shooting at it, but of course that has no
     effect. It catches him in a corridor, where he has
     an appreciative look at a departing woman.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  CREWWOMAN
     I'm going to B deck.

  REED
     B deck is fine. Are you a female?

  CREWWOMAN
     Sir?

  REED
     Your gender. You are a female, correct?

  CREWWOMAN
     Last time I checked.

  REED
     I am a male.

  CREWWOMAN
     I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.

  REED
     There seem to be a number of anatomical
     differences.

  CREWWOMAN
     Sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks out of the lift, leaving him to select
     another destination.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     She is in her casual clothes reading a book when
     the doorbell chimes.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  REED
     Sub-Commander.

  T'POL
     Is there something I can do for you?

  REED
     You are very beautiful. Are you aware that you are
     the most attractive woman on board this ship?

  T'POL
     Do you think it's appropriate for you to be here
     at this hour?

  REED
     Would you mind taking off your clothing? I'd like
     to learn more about your anatomy.

  T'POL
     Have you been drinking?

  REED
     If we are to engage in mating, it would be easier
     if you disrobed.

  T'POL
     T'Pol to Captain Archer.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  T'POL
     Would you please come to my quarters with a
     security team.

  ARCHER [OC]
     We're on our way.

  REED
     Are you afraid of me? You shouldn't be.

  T'POL
     I'm capable of defending myself.

  REED
     What is it like being a female? Is it much
     different?

  T'POL
     I wouldn't know.

  REED
     If you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out.

  T'POL
     I don't understand.

  REED
     If you came to us, you could experience what it's
     like to be male. Wouldn't that be helpful to you?

  T'POL
     I've never thought about it.

  REED
     You should. We're capable of letting you
     experience anything you wish for. It would be a
     shame not to take advantage of that.

  ANNOTATION
     As he reaches to touch her face, the door opens
     and T'Pol moves away.

  T'POL
     This isn't Lieutenant Reed.

  ARCHER
     Enough! Humans don't like doing things without
     their consent. When are you planning to return
     Malcolm Reed?

  REED
     That depends.

  ARCHER
     Oh, does it? Let's see how much you enjoy
     experiencing the human condition locked in Reed's
     quarters.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Tucker.

  ARCHER [OC]
     They've got Malcolm. I need the ship


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     Ready to go on my command.

  TUCKER [OC]
     They're going to give him back, aren't they?

  ARCHER
     We'll see.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     What did you do with the, er?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     A security detail locked him in Malcolm's
     quarters. Get it down, Trip.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Right away, sir. You heard him. (to Rostov) Let's
     try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up the
     injectors. Tucker to Ensign Cook.

  COOK [OC]
     Yes, sir.

  TUCKER
     I need you and two other engineers down here right
     away.

  COOK [OC]
     I'll see who I can find.

  ROSTOV [OC]
     Commander!

  TUCKER
     Quickly please. Tucker out. Something wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to where Rostov is just staring at a
     control board.

  TUCKER
     Run into a problem?

  ROSTOV
     Problem? No, everything's fine.

  TUCKER
     Did you have any luck priming the pumps?

  ROSTOV
     I have no idea how to do that. This engine is very
     complex.

  TUCKER
     Stay here. I'll be right back. Tucker to the
     Captain.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ARCHER
     Go ahead, Trip.

  TUCKER [OC]
     It's Rostov, sir. I think you need to get Malcolm.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     I mean, whoever's running Security, down here
     right away.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Hoshi, get a security team to Engineering. Have
     them put Crewman Rostov in his quarters.

  HOSHI
     Aye, sir. Captain, we've been getting reports from
     all over the ship. Some of the crew are acting
     very strange.

  ARCHER
     Then we're going to need more than one security
     team. Find out who's acting strange and have them
     confined to their quarters.

  TRAVIS
     How do we know the security officers are okay?

  ARCHER
     For the moment, we're going to have to hope they
     are. (to T'Pol) Start working on a way to figure
     out who's themselves and who's not. Maybe Phlox
     can help you.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is staring at a Tactical Alert display.

  COOK
     Commander.

  TUCKER
     Run into a problem?

  COOK
     No, sir. Just ready to calibrate the dilithium
     matrix.

  TUCKER
     Great. Wait till I give you the signal.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     We polarised the hull plating as soon as we
     detected that ship. Obviously it didn't do any
     good. What's keeping them from taking all of us?

  ARCHER
     Archer.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     You've got impulse engines back, Captain.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Thanks, Trip.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     (to Travis) Hold our position.

  HOSHI
     I thought you said we needed to get out of here.

  ARCHER
     They've got Malcolm, and God knows how many
     others. Until we find a way to get them back,
     we're not going anywhere.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     What's the big secret?

  T'POL
     We thought it best not to discuss this over the
     comm. We don't know who's been taken.

  ARCHER
     What have you got?

  PHLOX
     It was simpler than I thought. Elevated
     acetylcholine levels in the autonomic nervous

  ARCHER
     Doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to
     work.

  PHLOX
     The Sub-Commander programmed the medical computer.
     It's modifying this hand-scanner as we speak.

  ARCHER
     Get to work as soon as you're ready.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER [OC]
     Tucker to Ensign Mayweather.

  TRAVIS
     Go ahead, sir.

  TUCKER [OC]
     I'm a little short-handed, Travis.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Think I could get you to go back to the starboard
     nacelle and re-polarise the warp coils?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     No problem, sir.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Call me when you get to the catwalk.

  TRAVIS
     I'm on my way.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol and Phlox are at a table having drinks while
     lots of crew are getting meals and socialising.

  T'POL
     There are two here.

  PHLOX
     Ensign Cole and Crewman Rossi.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol goes out, and returns with a couple of burly
     security men.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  TRAVIS
     Mayweather to the Bridge.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  TRAVIS
     One of those things just followed me up the
     starboard strut, but when I got into the catwalk
     it didn't come through. There must be something
     keeping it from getting in here.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Then you'd better stay where you are.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Commander Tucker.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Yes, Captain?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Is there some kind of shielding


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     In the nacelles that might keep these aliens from
     getting in?


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     The catwalk's reinforced with osmium alloy, but
     it's hard to say if that would do it.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Travis thinks it will.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     I need you to stop whatever you're doing and
     transfer all command functions


LOCATION--Engineering

  ARCHER [OC]
     To the starboard catwalk. We're going to have to
     get everybody in there.

  TUCKER
     I'm on it.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     I want you and T'Pol to get the crew up there as
     quickly as you can. Hoshi.

  HOSHI
     It would be best if they stayed where they were.

  ARCHER
     What?

  HOSHI
     We're offering them a great opportunity. They may
     never get another chance to experience existence
     as we do.

  ARCHER
     Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my
     crew. Why?

  HOSHI
     I understand how you may be frightened by all
     this. Losing your substance, existing as
     perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once
     you've made the crossing, I promise you.

  ARCHER
     We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not
     very anxious to give it up.

  HOSHI
     Those who've preceded you are safe and happy.
     They'll understand.

  ARCHER
     Are you doing this for our benefit or for yours?

  ANNOTATION
     Two security guards arrive.

  ARCHER
     Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters.

  HOSHI
     You'll understand.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ANNOTATION
     Lights are up and people are settling in like last
     time.

  ARCHER
     How many?

  T'POL
     Fifty eight, including us.

  ARCHER
     And outside?

  T'POL
     Twenty four locked in their quarters, and Doctor
     Phlox.

  ARCHER
     You okay, Travis?

  TRAVIS
     I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

  ARCHER
     Trip?

  TRAVIS
     I saw him down near the Command Compartment.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  T'POL
     We need to learn more about these life forms.

  ARCHER
     What we need is to get our people back.

  T'POL
     It's illogical to believe we can do that without
     learning more about the aliens' intentions.

  ARCHER
     Do you have something in mind?

  T'POL
     I'd like your permission to leave the catwalk.

  ARCHER
     You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things
     would take you before you got back to the saucer
     section.

  T'POL
     Not necessarily. If a lifeform attempts to
     exchange its consciousness with mine, I believe I
     can prevent it.

  ARCHER
     What makes you think that?

  T'POL
     No offence, Captain, but the Vulcan mind is far
     more disciplined that yours. It can resist
     temptations, emotions, and I believe, invasions by
     these lifeforms.

  ARCHER
     Even if you're right, what would you accomplish?

  T'POL
     If an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a
     brief period when our minds are conjoined. It's
     possible I can ascertain their motives.

  ARCHER
     It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.

  T'POL
     There's no other choice.

  ARCHER
     And if you're wrong?

  T'POL
     It's a risk I'm willing to take.

  ARCHER
     Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four
     people. I'm not going to give them another one.

  T'POL
     You told me you trust my judgment. Trust it now,
     unless you have another suggestion.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The comm. beeps.

  PHLOX
     Sickbay.

  HOSHI [OC]
     There's been an accident.

  PHLOX
     Hoshi?

  HOSHI [OC]
     Hoshi Sato's been injured. I don't know how to
     repair the damage to her body.

  PHLOX
     What happened?

  HOSHI [OC]
     Her leg is fractured. She's in considerable pain.
     She needs assistance.


LOCATION--Hoshi's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox has brought a phase pistol with him. He
     presses the intercom.

  PHLOX
     I'm armed. If you're near the door, step away.

  HOSHI [OC]
     She's on the floor. She can't move.

  ANNOTATION
     He enters, and keeps the pistol pointed at her
     while he does a scan from just our of reach.

  PHLOX
     There's nothing the matter with you.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi jumps him as he's looking at the scanner.
     They fight and she gets the pistol, but she's
     lying on the floor and he has hold of one of her
     legs.

  HOSHI
     I need to find the rest of your crew. Where are
     they?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox gets a hypospray from his bag and injects
     her. She passes out.

  PHLOX
     (to spray) I'm glad I brought you along.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox's communicator chirps.

  PHLOX
     Doctor Phlox.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Is everything going all right, Doc?

  PHLOX
     More or less.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Good. T'Pol and I are going to need your help.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol has left the starboard nacelle and is
     walking along the corridors when a blue wisp finds
     her and enters her head.

  PHLOX
     Sub-Commander? T'Pol?

  ANNOTATION
     She's standing motionless.

  PHLOX
     Have you succeeded?

  ANNOTATION
     He scans her.

  PHLOX
     Phlox to Captain Archer.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ARCHER
     Did you find her?

  PHLOX [OC]
     I'm with her now. She's not acting like the others


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     But she's certainly not herself.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ARCHER
     Doesn't sound like that's the outcome she
     expected.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Her neural pathways are hyperstimulated.

  ARCHER
     Damn it. You'd better take her to her quarters.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Yes, Captain.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     Come with me. Everything will be all right.

  ANNOTATION
     He cannot budge her so he gets our the hypospray
     again.

  PHLOX
     I'm afraid I have to insist. I promise you

  ANNOTATION
     Then the blue wisp leaves her, she slumps and he
     catches her.

  PHLOX
     T'Pol! What is my name? Sub-Commander!

  T'POL
     They're lying to us.

  PHLOX
     My name.

  T'POL
     We don't have time for this, Phlox. I have to get
     to the Captain.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  T'POL
     Their ship is deteriorating, and they have no way
     to repair it. They can't survive in space.

  ARCHER
     So they are doing this to save themselves.

  T'POL
     Eighty two of them are. One for every crewman on
     Enterprise.

  TRAVIS
     How many of them are there?

  T'POL
     Hundreds. The rest will try to find another vessel
     of corporeal beings. Where's Commander Tucker?

  TRAVIS
     I'm not sure.

  T'POL
     Please find him.

  ANNOTATION
     Travis leaves.

  T'POL
     If the Commander can find a way to shield
     Enterprise, we can leave the catwalk and go to
     warp.

  ARCHER
     And lose a third of the crew?

  T'POL
     Two thirds will survive.

  ARCHER
     Unacceptable. We're going to find a way to get
     them back.

  T'POL
     That may be difficult.

  ARCHER
     Can they survive in a host that's dead?

  T'POL
     It would be no different than being exposed to
     space. They'd die.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Phlox.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Yes, Captain.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ANNOTATION
     Travis is walking along, looking for Tucker. The
     crew look rather worried.

  TRAVIS
     Are you doing all right?

  CREWMAN
     We're okay.

  CREWMAN 2
     How long do you think we'll be in here, Ensign?

  TRAVIS
     I'm sure the Captain will get us out as soon as he
     can. Has anyone seen Commander Tucker?

  CREWMAN
     No, sir.

  CREWMAN 2
     Not for a while. I think he was down there.

  TRAVIS
     Thanks.


LOCATION--Locker room

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is getting into a space suit.

  PHLOX
     We'll have to purge the carbon dioxide within
     twenty seconds of respiratory failure.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     That'll give you enough time to resuscitate them?

  PHLOX [OC]
     Oh, yes.


LOCATION--Locker room

  PHLOX
     It's enough time. Don't forget to close off the
     ventilation to the starboard nacelle.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     We wouldn't want the gas to affect you and the
     others.

  ARCHER
     Understood.

  TRAVIS
     Sorry, Captain, I can't find Commander Tucker.

  ARCHER
     Has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches?

  T'POL
     Not since we sealed them.

  ARCHER
     You must've missed him.

  TRAVIS
     I'll look again.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is reading the numbers on the panels.

  PHLOX
     Four, five, six, seven.

  ARCHER [OC]
     All right. Does it have an ID tag?

  PHLOX
     Junction four one alpha. Atmospheric


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     Recycling manifold.

  ARCHER
     Good. Do you see the releases on either side?

  PHLOX [OC]
     Yes. There are four of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is standing watching through a grid,
     looking impassive.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Two blue.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     Two silver.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Open them. The silver ones first.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     Done.

  ARCHER
     Now pull the panel off.

  PHLOX
     What should I do with it?


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Whatever you want.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  ARCHER [OC]
     Lay it down on the floor.

  PHLOX
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls it off to reveal a right angled pipe and
     a load of lights.

  PHLOX
     Right where you said it was, Captain.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Find the control panel.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     It's right here. It has six green lights.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Each of them should have a switch next to it.

  PHLOX [OC]
     About five centimetres to the left.

  ARCHER
     Now, before we can release the gas into central
     ventilation, you're going to have to reroute the
     transfer lines to the carbon dioxide tanks.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves quietly.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     And how do I go about doing that?


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  T'POL
     Those six switches control the feed. You're going
     to have to recalibrate them in sequence for CO2.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  T'POL [OC]
     I'll guide you through it.

  TRAVIS
     Commander, I've been looking all over for you! Are
     you all right, sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is working busily at a wall control panel,
     then abruptly gets onto the catwalk and walks
     briskly away.

  TUCKER
     I'm fine.

  TRAVIS
     The Captain asked me to find you. He needs you in
     the Command Compartment. Commander!

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker breaks into a run, knocking crewmen aside
     then goes to open the hatch.

  TRAVIS
     You can't go out there, sir. It's not safe!

  ANNOTATION
     He gets pushed away.

  TRAVIS
     What are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Travis gets hit, hard, then Tucker goes down the
     ladder to the main body of the ship.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     I've reached the access tube, Captain.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Good. Now pull off the panel.

  PHLOX
     (heaves at the bar) It's not coming off.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     It'll come off. You just need to use a little
     muscle.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     I've used every muscle I've got. it won't budge.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Try using your foot


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     For leverage.

  ANNOTATION
     It comes away so suddenly he falls against the
     bulkhead opposite

  PHLOX
     Good suggestion.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Okay.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Now, the next part's a piece of cake.

  TRAVIS
     We've got a problem, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Stand by, Doc. What happened?

  TRAVIS
     Commander Tucker. He just went out the forward
     hatch.

  ARCHER
     What?

  TRAVIS
     I tried to stop him, sir. He didn't look like
     himself. I think one of those things got inside
     him.

  T'POL
     If he knows what we're doing.

  ARCHER
     We're going to have to speed things up, Doc.
     Trip's been taken. He left the catwalk a few
     minutes ago.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     If he tries to let his buddies out of their
     quarters we don't have any guards down there to
     stop him.

  PHLOX
     Tell me what to do.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     You'll have to purge the osmotic filters.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     The valves are right behind the control circuit.
     You're going to have to get two fingers through
     the upper holes in the support plate.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but wearing
     those gloves


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     Could make it difficult.

  PHLOX
     Back home, I'm known for my fine motor skills. I
     doubt a pair of EV gloves


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     Will deter me.

  T'POL
     There are two solenoids behind the openings. When
     you tap them simultaneously, the plate should
     retract.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     Did you say there were two?


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ANNOTATION
     Archer checks the schematic on the monitor/.

  ARCHER
     About three centimetres apart.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     Got it.

  ARCHER [OC]
     You should be looking at two rotary valves and a
     lever.

  PHLOX
     I see them.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Open both valves all the way, then turn the lever
     to the three o'clock position. That should do it.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox seals his helmet shut.

  T'POL
     T'POL: The nine o'clock position will vent the gas
     when we're finished.

  ANNOTATION
     As Phlox reaches for the lever, Tucker grabs his
     arm, throws him away and starts closing the valves
     instead. Hitting him with the metal cover doesn't
     stop him, but a headbutt from a space helmet does.
     The CO2 is released while the possessed engineer
     tries to move the lever back, and he passes out.

  PHLOX
     Phlox to Captain Archer.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  PHLOX
     Mission accomplished.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     I'm monitoring Commander Tucker.

  ARCHER
     Good job.

  ANNOTATION
     Throughout the ship, possessed crew pass out,
     yellow wisps return home and blue ones leave.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     It's left Commander Tucker.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Vent the gas.

  PHLOX
     In a moment, Captain. I need to be certain the CO2
     levels are consistent throughout the ship, that
     all the lifeforms are gone.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Ready, Travis?

  TRAVIS
     (at the helm) Yes, sir.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     It's done.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Full impulse.

  T'POL
     They're in pursuit.

  ANNOTATION
     The big ship opens it's maw again.

  T'POL
     Stand by. Now.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer fires two torpedoes at it. They detonate
     within the cavernous body and the ship falls to
     pieces.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUCKER
     What's going on, Doc?

  PHLOX
     Just breathe deeply. You'll be fine.

  TUCKER
     I was just at a barbecue.

  PHLOX
     In through the nose, out through the mouth.

  TUCKER
     I've never seen so many ribs. (Phlox helps him to
     his feet.)

  PHLOX
     Follow me, Commander. We have a lot of doors to
     unlock.
