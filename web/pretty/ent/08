Breaking The Ice
TEASER

LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is looking at a child's drawing.

  TUCKER
     Looks like we're going about warp four point five.

  PHLOX
     Human children have such fertile imaginations.
     Sub-commander.

  TUCKER
     These were sent by my nephew's fourth grade class.
     I thought the crew might like to see how excited
     folks at home are about our mission.

  PHLOX
     I'm going to put this one up in Sickbay. Would you
     like one for your quarters?

  T'POL
     This rendering is crude, yet surprisingly
     accurate.

  TUCKER
     Some of these kids are pretty talented. Which one
     do you want? This one's nice. Or maybe you want
     First Contact. Or how about this one?

  ANNOTATION
     A picture of a green Vulcan with huge ears.

  T'POL
     We're dropping out of warp.

  ARCHER [OC]
     For those of you who aren't near a window, you
     might want to find one. There's something pretty
     amazing off starboard.

  ANNOTATION
     A comet is gliding past.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Senior staff


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Please report to the Bridge.

  REED
     I've checked the Vulcan database, sir. No previous
     sightings.

  HOSHI
     That means we discovered it.

  TRAVIS
     Archer's comet.

  ARCHER
     Take us closer, Ensign.

  TRAVIS
     Aye sir.

  ARCHER
     Ever seen anything like that in your astronomy
     books?

  TUCKER
     Wow, that's one big snowball.

  T'POL
     The diameter is eighty two point six kilometres.

  ARCHER
     I always wanted to chase a comet. Maybe we should
     spend a few days following this one.

  T'POL
     Vulcan and human scientists have researched
     hundreds of comets. They've proven to be little
     more than rock and ice.

  ARCHER
     Except this one's bigger than any comet humans
     have ever seen. That's got to be worth a look.
     Stay with it, Travis.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     In her quarters, T'Pol stares at characters on a
     computer screen.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker selects a dish from the cabinet, then
     orders his drink from the dispenser.

  TUCKER
     Milk, cold.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol enters.

  TUCKER
     Catching up on your reading?

  T'POL
     I came for a tea.

  TUCKER
     Stay away from the Zariphean blend unless you want
     to stay up for the next three days.

  T'POL
     Caffeine has little effect on Vulcan physiology.
     Green tea, hot.

  TUCKER
     You want to join me? I could use the company.

  T'POL
     I'm very tired.

  TUCKER
     Tell me about it. I put out about a hundred fires
     in Engineering this afternoon and missed dinner.
     Then somebody told me Chef made a pecan pie, and
     suddenly my life brightened. It's been my
     favourite since I was a kid. Care for a bite?

  T'POL
     No thank you.

  TUCKER
     It's delicious.

  T'POL
     It's mostly sugar.

  TUCKER
     What, Vulcans don't have a sweet tooth? It may not
     be good for the body, but it sure is good for the
     soul. Mmm, I feel better already.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol reads her PADD.

  TUCKER
     Must be a real page turner. You all right?

  T'POL
     I'm fine, Commander. Goodnight.

  TUCKER
     Sweet dreams.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ARCHER
     Eisilium?

  T'POL
     It's an extremely rare mineral. This comet appears
     to contain large quantities of it.

  ARCHER
     I've never heard of eisilium.

  T'POL
     Vulcan chemists have only obtained small amounts.
     They've never been able to study it in detail.

  ARCHER
     This could be your chance. Can we collect a sample
     with the transporter?

  T'POL
     Most of the eisilium deposits are at least twenty
     metres beneath the crust.

  TUCKER
     That's too deep to get a lock.

  REED
     We've got the portable drilling rig, sir.

  TRAVIS
     The comet's certainly big enough to land on. We
     could take a shuttlepod.

  T'POL
     I'd advise setting down near one of the two poles.
     If you're out of direct sunlight, the surface ice
     will be more stable.

  ARCHER
     How long would you need?

  REED
     Shouldn't take more than three or four hours.

  ARCHER
     You up for a little comet walk?

  REED
     By all means.

  ARCHER
     Get started.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     Captain, I'm detecting a vessel closing on our
     position. It's Vulcan.

  T'POL
     The starship Ti'Mur.

  ARCHER
     Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the
     Starship Enterprise.

  VANIK [on viewscreen]
     I'm Captain Vanik.

  ARCHER
     Pleased to meet you.

  VANIK [on viewscreen]
     You're a long way from Earth, Captain. Are you
     lost?

  ARCHER
     Not at all. Just taking a look at this comet.

  VANIK [on viewscreen]
     Our sensors detected it two days ago. We also
     decided to investigate.

  ARCHER
     Really? My science officer tells me that Vulcans
     that Vulcans aren't very interested in comets.

  VANIK [on viewscreen]
     Actually, it's your interest in the comet that
     we're investigating.

  ARCHER
     We plan to send a drilling team to the surface to
     collect core samples. You're welcome to
     participate.

  VANIK [on viewscreen]
     If you have no objection, we'd like to remain here
     and observe.

  ARCHER
     Stay as long as you want.

  ANNOTATION
     Vanik cuts transmission.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     I'd love to know what they're really doing here.
     You don't find anything strange about them
     suddenly showing up?

  T'POL
     Perhaps they're simply curious.

  ARCHER
     Curious? That doesn't sound very Vulcan to me.
     This isn't the first time we've caught them
     lurking around. Remember three weeks ago, the
     planetary nebula?

  T'POL
     That was nothing more than a survey ship.

  ARCHER
     So why didn't they respond to our hails? Why'd
     they go to warp when we headed toward them? I'm
     starting to get the feeling they're looking over
     our shoulder a little too often.

  T'POL
     That seems unlikely.

  ARCHER
     We'll see. Fine. If Vanik is the kind of guy who
     likes to watch, let him.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  REED
     I've never stood on a comet before.

  TRAVIS
     Has anyone?

  REED
     Good question.

  TRAVIS
     I've only seen snow twice in my life.

  REED
     Well, then it's only fitting that we commemorate
     the occasion.

  TRAVIS
     You mean plant a flag?

  REED
     No, too predictable.

  TRAVIS
     Snowball fight.

  REED
     The EV suits would take all the fun out of that.
     We'll just have to see how the spirit moves us
     when we get there.

  ANNOTATION
     They land on the comet, and stand on the ragged
     and pockmarked surface. Travis has a big, big
     grin.


LOCATION--Engineering

  HOSHI
     Commander, you wanted to see me?

  TUCKER
     Take a look at something, will you? I've been
     running diagnostics and I found some kind of power
     surge in the transceiver array.

  HOSHI
     Looks like an encrypted transmission. It came from
     the Vulcan ship.

  TUCKER
     Who was it sent to?


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     You're sure this was sent to her quarters.

  TUCKER
     I wish I wasn't. Did she say anything to you about
     it?

  ARCHER
     Not a word. We had an agreement. She promised not
     to speak to the Vulcans without telling me.

  TUCKER
     Looks like she's having some trouble keeping her
     promises. Should I have Hoshi decrypt it?

  ARCHER
     Tell her it's top priority.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     Whenever you're ready, Captain.

  TUCKER
     (at Reed's station) You sure you want me here for
     this? I've got a lot of work to do.

  ARCHER
     Stay put, Commander. This is important. Start the
     recording. To the students of Miz Malvin's fourth
     grade class at the Worley Elementary School in
     Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland. This is Captain
     Archer aboard the starship Enterprise. On behalf
     of the entire crew, I'd like to thank you for your
     transmission. We all got a real kick out of your
     drawings and letters. You asked a lot of
     interesting questions. I wish we had time to
     answer all of them, but if we did that, we
     wouldn't get much exploring done. So I've selected
     a few, and hopefully our answers will give you a
     better idea of what life is like out here. Liam
     Brennan asks 'what do you eat?' For the most part,
     the same things you eat at home. Our Chef can make
     anything from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
     to turkey with all the trimmings. We have a
     hydroponic greenhouse onboard where we grow fruits
     and vegetables, and we can also replicate certain
     foods with our protein resequencer. Here's one
     from Geoff Miles. 'Is dating

  SOMEONE
     allowed on Enterprise?' Well, it's not
     discouraged, but there isn't a lot of privacy on a
     starship. Most of our crew share quarters with at
     least one other person, so it wouldn't exactly be
     practical. But if two crewmembers decide that they
     really like each other, there are a lot of places
     they can go to look at the stars. Chloe O'Shannon
     wants to know, 'how do we talk to aliens?' I think
     I'll give that one to my Communications Officer,
     Ensign Hoshi Sato.

  HOSHI
     Well, Chloe, that's a very good question. We use a
     device called the universal translator. It's like
     an alien dictionary with hundreds of languages
     programmed into it, and it can learn new languages
     very quickly, but it doesn't always work, and when
     that happens it's up to me to try to translate.
     I'm sure I don't have to tell you it can be really
     hard sometimes. One wrong word can mean the
     difference between saying 'take my hand' or 'take
     my life'. So far I have managed to do pretty well.

  ARCHER
     Thanks, Hoshi. Here's one from Molly McCook. 'When
     you flush the toilet, where does it go?' That
     sounds like an engineering question, so we'll ask
     Commander Charles Tucker, our Chief Engineer.
     Trip.

  TUCKER
     Pause it, will you?

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi does.

  TUCKER
     A poop question, sir? Can't I talk about the warp
     reactor or the transporter?

  ARCHER
     It's a perfectly valid question.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker nods at Hoshi to resume recording.

  TUCKER
     The first thing you've got to understand is we
     recycle pretty much everything on a starship. That
     includes waste, and the first thing that happens
     to the waste is it gets processed through a
     machine called a bio-matter resequencer. Then it
     gets broken down into. Hold on.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi pauses recording.

  TUCKER
     They're going to think I'm the sanitation
     engineer.

  ARCHER
     You're doing fine.

  ANNOTATION
     The recording is resumed.

  TUCKER
     So the waste is broken down into little molecules
     and then they get transformed into any number of
     things we can use on the ship. Cargo containers,
     insulation, boots, you name it.

  ARCHER
     Very enlightening, Commander. Gabrielle Witty
     wants to know if germs can live in space.

  PHLOX
     (at T'Pol's station) Ah, I believe I can answer
     that, Captain. Hello, children. I'm Doctor Phlox,
     the ship's physician. I'm from a system called
     Denobula Triaxa and I feel very honoured to be
     part of this important mission. Germs. They may be
     tiny but they are among the most resilient
     organisms known to medical science. They can
     survive almost anywhere, on your kitchen counter,
     under your fingernail, in the vacuum of space.
     Over two hundred million space-dwelling microbes
     have been catalogued. One of the most virulent
     species lives inside grains of interstellar dust.
     Polycocyx astris. They can drift in a dormant
     state for millions of years and still cause a
     nasty cold. I once discovered a peculiar colony of
     spores on the hull of a

  ARCHER
     Thank you, Doctor. Fascinating. I think we've
     taken up enough of Miz Malvin's classroom time. By
     the way, we've included some pictures of a comet
     we're studying. We think it might be the biggest
     one ever discovered by humans or Vulcans. That's
     what's so exciting about being on Enterprise. You
     never know what you're going to find next. We miss
     Earth, but hearing from you makes us all feel a
     little closer to home. Captain Archer, out.

  ANNOTATION
     The recording is stopped.

  ARCHER
     How'd it go?


LOCATION--Comet surface

  REED
     The beauty of ice is that it records everything
     like a blank page. The farther down you drill, the
     farther back in time you go.

  TRAVIS
     Lieutenant.

  REED
     Yes?

  TRAVIS
     What do you think?

  ANNOTATION
     He's built a snowman.

  REED
     Hand me the plasma torch.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed gives it two eyes and a smiling mouth, and
     sticks the torch in as a nose.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Archer to Lieutenant Reed.

  REED
     Go ahead, sir.

  ARCHER [OC]
     How are you doing, Malcolm?

  REED
     We're just about to set the charges.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     I'm sure I don't need to remind you we're being
     observed.

  ANNOTATION
     The two men and the snowman are on the viewscreen.

  REED [OC]
     No, sir.

  ARCHER
     We want this to go as smoothly as possible.

     Make a good impression.

  REED
     Right.

  ARCHER [OC]
     So tell me,

LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Any luck?

  HOSHI
     Sorry it took so long. The code was pretty
     complex.

  TUCKER
     What's it say?

  HOSHI
     It's in Vulcan. You'll have to run it through the
     translation matrix.

  TUCKER
     You didn't read it?

  HOSHI
     I didn't feel it'd be right.

  TUCKER
     Thanks.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves. He goes to his console and translates
     it


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  TUCKER
     Well, we decrypted the message.

  ARCHER
     And?

  TUCKER
     It's not exactly what we expected. It's a letter.

  ARCHER
     What did it say?

  TUCKER
     It's personal.

  ARCHER
     What do you mean?

  TUCKER
     Very personal. You could order me to tell you,
     sir, but you wouldn't be happy if I did.

  ARCHER
     Why the hell was it encrypted?

  TUCKER
     That's what I want to know. Maybe Vulcans encrypt
     all their personal letters. All they had to do was
     send it through regular channels, mark it
     personal, and we'd have left it alone. But no,
     they had to encrypt it, force me to start
     snooping. I feel like I got caught with my hand in
     the cookie jar.

  ARCHER
     Let it go, Trip. Come on, it was an honest
     mistake.

  TUCKER
     I can't let it go. I've got to tell her.

  ARCHER
     How's that going to help?

  TUCKER
     It's the right thing to do. At least I'll be able
     to look her in the eye without feeling guilty.

  ARCHER
     You're a good man. You might want to take a phase
     pistol with you.

  TUCKER
     I might need one.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Got a minute? In private?

  T'POL
     Excuse us, crewman.

  ANNOTATION
     The crewman leaves.

  TUCKER
     Did you ever, did you ever do anything totally by
     mistake that you weren't very proud of?

  T'POL
     No.

  TUCKER
     Did you ever come across something that you
     thought was one thing so you reacted in a certain
     way, but then it turned out to be something
     completely different?

  T'POL
     Your point, Commander?

  TUCKER
     I found out about your message from the Vulcan
     ship.

  T'POL
     It was a personal matter.

  TUCKER
     Why wasn't it sent through normal Starfleet
     channels?

  T'POL
     That takes time. The letter was important.

  TUCKER
     So they sent it in code? Do you have any idea how
     suspicious that looked?

  T'POL
     You read my letter?

  TUCKER
     Believe me, I don't feel very good about it.

  T'POL
     I have more letters in my quarters. Would you like
     to read those as well?

  TUCKER
     I'm trying to apologise here.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Archer to T'Pol.

  T'POL
     Yes, Captain.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Please report to my Ready room.

  T'POL
     Has anyone else read the letter?

  TUCKER
     No.

  T'POL
     I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention it.

  TUCKER
     I won't, I promise.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     I thought I'd invite Captain Vanik for a visit. If
     he's so interested in how we do things, he might
     as well come see for himself. Once he realises
     we're not going to blow up the galaxy, maybe he'll
     leave us alone.

  T'POL
     I'm sure he'll appreciate the gesture.

  ARCHER
     Dinner's a good way to break the ice. I was hoping
     you might give Chef some menu suggestions.

  T'POL
     Certainly.

  ARCHER
     A little food, a little wine.

  T'POL
     Vulcans don't drink wine.

  ARCHER
     You know what I mean. Just help me make him go
     away.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     When did these symptoms begin?

  T'POL
     Two days ago.

  PHLOX
     (checking her neck) Perhaps you slept in an
     awkward position.

  T'POL
     I haven't slept.

  PHLOX
     For two days? Something on your mind? It appears
     to be a tension headache. You know anything said
     between us is strictly confidential. Would you
     like to talk about what's troubling you?

  T'POL
     No.

  PHLOX
     I don't know if there's anyone on this ship you
     would feel comfortable talking with, but if there
     is, it might feel good to get whatever's bothering
     you out in the open. (gives her a hypo) This is a
     simple analgesic. I can give you something later
     to help you sleep this evening, if you'd like.

  VANIK
     Our warp systems are classified.

  ARCHER
     A few years back I was a guest aboard a Maymora
     class ship, the Yarahla. Captain Tok. Do you know
     him?

  VANIK
     Not personally.

  ARCHER
     Oh. We made a run to a dark matter nebula. I
     helped set up the graviton telescope. Most fun
     I've ever had on a space walk. Those Vulcan EV
     suits are something else, like you're flying
     around inside your own little starship.
