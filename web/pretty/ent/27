LOCATION--Captain's mess

  ANNOTATION
     Archer pours red wine into T'Pol's glass.

  ARCHER
     Say when.

  ANNOTATION
     At about one inch.

  T'POL
     When.

  ARCHER
     I didn't know you drank wine.

  T'POL
     Under the circumstances I'll allow myself a small
     indulgence.

  TUCKER
     Make mine a large indulgence.

  ARCHER
     To our Science Officer. It's been one year to the
     day since you officially joined our crew.

  TUCKER
     Here's to many more.

  T'POL
     I appreciate the sentiment but I'm simply carrying
     out my assignment.

  ARCHER
     That's no small accomplishment considering the
     previous record for a Vulcan serving on a human
     ship was two weeks.

  T'POL
     Ten days.

  ARCHER
     I've been filling out your annual crew evaluation.
     Just a formality.

  T'POL
     I understand. The High Command has requested my
     evaluation of you. Just a formality.

  ARCHER
     There's something in your record I've been meaning
     to ask you about. While you were stationed in
     Sausalito you took a five-day leave.

  T'POL
     Yes?

  ARCHER
     You went to an old mining town in Pennsylvania,
     Carbon Creek? Seems like an odd place to take a
     vacation.

  T'POL
     Vulcans don't take vacations.

  ARCHER
     Then, if I may ask, why'd you go there?

  T'POL
     Is this part of my evaluation?

  ARCHER
     Just curious.

  T'POL
     It was a personal matter.

  TUCKER
     You had a personal matter in Carbon Creek,
     Pennsylvania?

  ARCHER
     Trip, if she doesn't want to tell us.

  TUCKER
     Seems a little unfair. We tell her plenty of
     stories.

  T'POL
     You'd like me to tell you a story?

  TUCKER
     If it's a good one.

  T'POL
     I went to Carbon Creek because I wanted to visit
     the site of First Contact between humans and
     Vulcans.

  ARCHER
     Then you were about three thousand kilometres off.
     That took place in Montana.

  T'POL
     Actually, it didn't.

  TUCKER
     Every school kid knows that Zephram Cochrane met
     the Vulcans in Bozeman, Montana, on April 5th,
     2063. I've been there. There's a statue.

  T'POL
     In fact, the Vulcans visited Earth long before
     then. My second foremother was one of them.

  TUCKER
     Your who?

  T'POL
     My mother's mother's mother. Would you like to
     hear the story?


LOCATION--Vulcan ship

  ANNOTATION
     Earth, October 1957 or later- you can tell because
     Sputnik is in orbit.

  STRON
     (middle aged man) I can't compensate.

  MESTRAL
     (younger man) The re-fusion pressure is still
     dropping.

  CAPTAIN
     (oldest man) If our orbit decays any further,
     we'll be detected.

  T'POL [OC]
     They'd gone to Earth to investigate the launch of
     its first artificial satellite, called Sputnik.


LOCATION--Captain's mess

  T'POL
     During their third week of gathering information
     about humanity their impulse manifold began to
     malfunction. They had no choice but to attempt an
     emergency landing.


LOCATION--Vulcan ship

  CAPTAIN
     Try to find an isolated area. Send a distress call
     to the High Command.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship burns through the atmosphere

  T'MIR
     (played by Jolene) One hundred kilometres.

  CAPTAIN
     Deploy the stabilisers.

  T'MIR
     Our landing vector is too steep.

  ANNOTATION
     A shooting star streaks through the night sky,
     explosions on the ship, a crash on a hillside. The
     ship is a wreck, with fires everywhere,

  STRON
     Are you hurt?

  T'MIR
     I don't think so. Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     He's dead.

  MESTRAL
     (to T'Mir) What are your orders?


LOCATION--Captain's mess

  ARCHER
     Why did the Vulcans keep this a secret?

  T'POL
     The incident is well-documented at the Science
     Directorate and the Space Council.

  TUCKER
     On Vulcan?

  T'POL
     Of course.

  TUCKER
     Hang on. T'Mir was your great-grandmother? I'd be
     the last person to question your math, but aren't
     you missing a few generations? Sputnik was two
     hundred years ago.

  ARCHER
     Don't forget how long Vulcans live.

  TUCKER
     Right. Just how old are you?

  ANNOTATION
     He gets a glare and turns to Archer.

  TUCKER
     It's got to be in her record.

  ARCHER
     Trip, that's classified information. Please, go
     on.

  T'POL
     Their subspace transceiver was damaged in the
     crash. They had no way of knowing if their
     distress signal had even been transmitted.


LOCATION--Pennsylvania

  T'POL [OC]
     They'd used up their emergency rations within a
     week. After five days without food their situation
     was growing desperate.

  T'MIR
     (scanner is beeping) Two lifeforms.

  ANNOTATION
     A couple of deer.

  T'MIR
     Fascinating.

  MESTRAL
     One of those creatures could sustain us for some
     time.

  STRON
     Are you suggesting we eat it?

  MESTRAL
     It's logical to take extreme measures to survive.

  STRON
     Even resorting to savagery?

  MESTRAL
     That may not be necessary. Our scans showed a
     settlement approximately six kilometres away.

  T'MIR
     If we're exposed, we could contaminate their
     culture.

  MESTRAL
     And when they find our bodies after we starve,
     will that contaminate their culture?

  STRON
     Better to leave them with a mystery than with
     three living aliens.

  MESTRAL
     We should at least investigate the possibilities.

  T'MIR
     It's too dangerous.

  MESTRAL
     I'm willing to take the risk.

  ANNOTATION
     Mestral walks off

  T'MIR
     Mestral. (to Stron) Remain here.


LOCATION--Carbon Creek

  ANNOTATION
     The Vulcan's keep out of sight.

  T'MIR
     How do you suggest we proceed?

  MESTRAL
     We'll need to disguise ourselves.

  ANNOTATION
     So they steal clothes off a line. T'Mir changes
     behind a sheet.

  T'MIR
     We're here to find food, nothing else. We'll keep
     contact with the humans to an absolute minimum. If
     we must interact with them I will speak.

  ANNOTATION
     She comes out from behind the sheet trying to do
     up a dress.

  T'MIR
     What is it?

  MESTRAL
     I believe you have that garment on backwards.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk along the main street. Mistral has a
     woolly hat pulled down over his ears and T'Mir has
     found a pair of shoes from somewhere too. They see
     a group of men getting off a bus.

  T'MIR
     Prisoners?

  MESTRAL
     They don't appear to be restrained. More likely
     labourers.

  T'MIR
     It's hard to believe these people were capable of
     launching an artificial satellite.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear a voice from a car radio and go to
     investigate the group of men listening to the
     match.

  RADIO
     And he gets the sigh, and here's the pitch. Dixon
     hits a scorcher down the right field line. The
     first baseman takes a stab at it, but no! Ellis is
     charging hard from right field. He scoops it up
     and fires. It's going to be close. There's a
     collision at the plate, but Wilcox hangs on to the
     ball and Thompson is out!

  T'MIR
     (walking on) Some type of combat, no doubt.

  MESTRAL
     I believe it may be an entertainment.

  ANNOTATION
     The Pine Tree bar and grill.

  T'MIR
     A communal gathering place.

  MESTRAL
     Do they have food?

  T'MIR
     It appears so. Remember.

  MESTRAL
     I won't speak.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds the door open for her.


LOCATION--Pine Tree bar

  ANNOTATION
     There's a pool table, and country music playing.
     All the men look up when they enter.

  MAGGIE
     Another?

  BILLY
     No, I'll settle up.

  MAGGIE
     All right.

  BILLY
     I'm next.

  T'MIR
     Currency.

  MESTRAL
     Yes. The paper appears to have value.

  ANNOTATION
     Billy puts some of his change in a jar.

  MAGGIE
     Thanks, Billy. (to T'Mir and Mestral) What can I
     get you?

  T'MIR
     Do you have anything that doesn't require
     currency?

  MAGGIE
     You mean free?

  ANNOTATION
     She puts a bowl of nuts in front of them and moves
     away.

  BILLY
     What brings you to Carbon Creek?

  T'MIR
     We had an accident with our vehicle outside your
     town.

  ANNOTATION
     Maggie returns with two glasses of water.

  MAGGIE
     Are you okay?

  T'MIR
     We're fine.

  MAGGIE
     You folks married?

  T'MIR
     No. We're business associates.

  BILLY
     There's a gas station up the road. I'd be happy to
     give you a lift.

  T'MIR
     No, thank you.

  BILLY
     Suit yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to the pool table.

  BILLY
     Anybody up for a game? Quarter a ball?

  JACK
     (a student carrying books) I'll play.

  BILLY
     You better ask your mother, Jackie.

  JACK
     Come on, Mom, we could use the money.

  MAGGIE
     Go on upstairs and do your homework. I'll bring
     you up some dinner.

  MESTRAL
     I'm up for a game.

  T'MIR
     What are you doing? I told you not to speak to
     anyone.

  MESTRAL
     I can defeat him.

  T'MIR
     You don't even know the rules.

  MESTRAL
     It's simple.

  BILLY
     I thought you didn't have any money.

  T'MIR
     He doesn't.

  BILLY
     Well, sorry, pal. There's nothing in it for me.

  T'MIR
     It's time for us to go.

  BILLY
     Wait a minute. We might be able to work something
     out. If you win, I'll pay up. If I win, your
     business associate has a drink with me.

  MESTRAL
     We accept your terms.

  T'MIR
     We do not.

  MESTRAL
     The game is based on simple geometry. It wouldn't
     challenge a Vulcan child.

  T'MIR
     No.

  MESTRAL
     We need their currency.

  T'MIR
     What if you lose? I'll have to socialise with him.

  MESTRAL
     Would you rather die of starvation?

  ANNOTATION
     So Mestral breaks.

  BILLY
     Tough break.

  ANNOTATION
     Billy makes the first pot or three, then misses
     and Mistral starts to clear the table.

  MESTRAL
     The number eight ball in that pocket.

  ANNOTATION
     Main Street] (The pair walk out of Johnnie's
     Market store with two brown bags full of
     groceries.

  MESTRAL
     Cryogenics.

  ANNOTATION
     A frozen meal in a packet.
