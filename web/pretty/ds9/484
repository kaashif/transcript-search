<tr id="L1"><td><a href="#L1">1</a></td><td>SISKO:  I don't like this. The more I read Starfleet's reports on the sabotage of the power relays, the more unanswered questions I have. How were the changelings able to infiltrate the Division of Planetary operations? Where did they get the codes for the Division's computer control network? And how did they even manage to disable every power relay on Earth at the same time?</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>ODO:  Captain, have you ever heard of a group called Red Squad?</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>SISKO:  They're an elite team of Starfleet cadets. According to Nog, every student at the Academy wants to be a part of it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>SISKO:  That's strange. During the blackout, Starfleet mobilised hundreds of units. Why would they demobilise Red Squad?</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>ODO:  That's why I brought it up. But if they're cadets I suppose Starfleet wanted to get them out of harm's way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L132"><td><a href="#L132">132</a></td><td>SISKO:  I'm sure the Admiral doesn't see it as treason. He would probably defend it as a desperate act of patriotism. He and his supporters think that their actions are both necessary and justified.</td></tr>

<tr id="L133"><td><a href="#L133">133</a></td><td>ODO:  Not to mention effective. Think about it. The power grid fails, and the next thing you know Starfleet security officers are on the streets of every city, armed with phaser rifles, blood testing citizens at random.</td></tr>
