<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>KIRA:  In other words, Zek, Grand Nagus or no Grand Nagus, if we allow you to hold these negotiations here, and we find out you're cheating the Dosi, I'll see to it that you never set foot on this station again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>ZEK:  Did anyone ever tell you your eyes shine with the brilliance of Kibberian fire diamonds.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>ZEK:  Well, you're right, Commander. We're all friends here. So I'll let you have it at cost.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>SISKO:  I have a better idea. Why not consider the nitrate as a gift to the people of Bajor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>ZEK:  A gift? That doesn't sound very profitable.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>SISKO:  It depends.</td></tr>
