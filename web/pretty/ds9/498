I've compared your current medical scans with ones I've made over the last four years and there are noticeable differences. Normally when you're in humanoid form, you have a specific density of one point four which is constant throughout your body. Your mass and density only vary when you change shape.

Furthermore, if the Federation still harbours any hope of peaceful coexistence with the Klingon Empire, it must abandon all Starbases and military installations in the Archanis Sector.
