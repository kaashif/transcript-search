<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>ODO:  That was for all of five minutes. Once you complained, I took the form of a Rafalian mouse.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>KIRA:  I hope Shakaar's gotten better at speaking in front of groups. He used to mumble his way through mission briefings. Everyone in our resistance cell had to learn to lip read.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>SARISH:  Don't forget to mention the transit subsidies you just allocated. Tell them they can expect the price of transport to Bajor to start dropping within a few months. And remember, enunciate.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>ODO:  As far as I'm concerned we should've gotten the First Minister off that podium as soon as we received the information.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>SARISH:  If Shakaar cancelled his public appearances every time someone threatened his life, he would never leave his office.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>ODO:  We're not talking about some disgruntled shopkeeper who writes a letter threatening Shakaar for raising taxes, we're talking about a Cardassian extremist group that's already succeeded in assassinating two Bajoran officials.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>ODO:  My sources in the Cardassian Civilian Government believe the True Way already has an operative in place aboard the station. I suggest you cancel the First Minister's conference and reschedule it at another location.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>SARISH:  Absolutely not. Nothing is going to keep Shakaar from meeting those delegates tomorrow. Bajor's effort to join the Federation hinges on what happens over the next few days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>KIRA:  So do I. Shakaar knows better than anyone you can't capitulate to terrorists. He used to be one, and the day the Cardassians started to negotiate with him was the day he knew they'd been beaten. He'll stay.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>SISKO:  I suppose if I were in his position I'd do the same. Constable, I want station security stepped up for the duration of Shakaar's visit.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>ODO:  The First Minister will have round-the-clock protection. I'd like to deploy Starfleet security personnel in addition to my own deputies.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>ODO:  I make order where I can. For one thing, I have a daily routine which I follow unwaveringly. Shopkeepers on the Promenade joke that they can set their clocks by me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>ODO:  There are other ways to create order in your life. Your quarters, for example. Everything in mine has its specific place and it's all arranged just so.</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>ODO:  Exactly.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>ODO:  I'll tell you what else to do. Make sure everyone knows they can't just drop by your quarters to say hello. If someone does, whatever happens, don't make them feel welcome.</td></tr>

<tr id="L101"><td><a href="#L101">101</a></td><td>WORF:  Of course not. That would only invite subsequent visits.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>ODO:  Precisely.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>WORF:  So far, the only person who has a tendency to drop by is Chief O'Brien.</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>ODO:  That's probably because he knows you from the Enterprise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>WORF:  Perhaps if I am more inhospitable, he will stop.</td></tr>
