<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>DUKAT:  The Pah wraiths are not what you think, Nerys, and neither am I. Let me ask you something. Have you ever wondered why the Prophets stood by and did nothing when Cardassia took over Bajor? Have you ever asked yourself how they could allow your people to suffer as they did?</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>KIRA:  The Prophets have a plan for us. It's not always easy to see what it is.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>DUKAT:  Even as you speak those words, you must know how hollow they sound. No, there's a much better explanation. One that makes perfect sense. The Prophets are not the true gods of Bajor, the Pah wraiths are. They were cast from the Celestial Temple because they wanted to take an active role in Bajoran life. Their only crime was that they cared about your people. But they were not allowed to help you because they'd lost the battle for heaven and were forced to flee.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>DUKAT:  Oh, come now, Nerys. You know as well as I do that history is written by the victors. But rest assured, there will be another chapter. The Pah wraiths are determined to reclaim their place in heaven.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>DUKAT:  I have touched by the hand of a god. I'm a changed man. Oh, I admit that when I first allowed myself to become a vessel for the Pah wraith, it was purely out of self-serving reasons. All I wanted was to help it enter the wormhole so it could force the Prophets out. It was nothing more than a way to exact vengeance on Sisko. But I had no idea the effect it would have on me. It was only inside of me for a very short time, but it opened my heart.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>KIRA:  Would that be before or after you killed Jadzia?</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>DUKAT:  That was most unfortunate, but it couldn't be helped. The Celestial Temple itself was at stake and she was in the way. Ah, Nerys, Nerys. I wish I had the words to describe what it was like to have the Pah wraith within me. I could feel its love, for me and for the Bajoran people. It made me realise I still have a role to play in Bajor's destiny.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>DUKAT:  You have no idea how much it pains me to know that I caused so much suffering. But I am not responsible for the occupation, the Prophets are.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>DUKAT:  They abandoned Bajor. I was simply walking the path they laid out for me. Now I walk with the true Prophets. I'm building a community here, Nerys. I brought these people to Empok Nor so that we could purify ourselves in preparation for the day the Pah wraiths reclaim the Celestial Temple.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>DUKAT:  You're still so full of anger toward me. I can only hope that one day you'll let it go. I brought you here because I want you to be a part of our community. I want you to share in the love these people have for one other. In the love they have for me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>KIRA:  Oh, they don't love you. You have some kind of a hold over them, but they don't love you.</td></tr>
