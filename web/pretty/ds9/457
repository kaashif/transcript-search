<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  It was a simple adjustment. The beam was just reacting to the accumulation of chroniton particles in the ship's hull.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  They're emitted by the cloaking device. They sometimes become lodged in the ship's ablative armour matrix.</td></tr>
