Now that we won, how can people just hand their freedom over to someone like Winn?</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>WINN:  Bareil saw himself as simply carrying out the will of the Prophets. To him, achieving peace with Cardassia was its own reward. He never wanted fame or glory for what he did. As someone who loved him, I'm surprised you didn't know that.</td></tr>

But as you know, the Cardassians poisoned much of our farmlands before they left, and Rakantha has been mostly barren wasteland ever since. After years of research, the agricultural ministry has finally developed reclamators which can detoxify the soil and make it fertile again.</td></tr>

By this time next year, we can be producing boton, moreka and salam grass. All valuable commodities for export. If we can attract interstellar commerce to Bajor, it will only enhance our application for membership in the Federation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>KIRA:  I understand.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>WINN:  Unfortunately, a group of farmers who were allowed to use the reclamators in another province are now refusing to return them. And this is why I've come to you, Kira. The farmers who seized the equipment are in Dahkur Province. Your home. And they're led by a man with whom you're acquainted. His name is Shakaar.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>KIRA:  Shakaar?</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>WINN:  And if I'm not mistaken, he was the leader of your resistance cell during the occupation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>WINN:  Not for me, child. For Bajor. I know we've had our differences in the past, but I'm asking you to put those feelings aside and think of what is best for our people. We're on the verge of a new era. The Occupation is over, we've achieved peace with Cardassia, Federation membership is only a few years away. This is an exciting time to be a Bajoran. But our future depends on each of us acting for the common good of all Bajor. Shakaar has lost sight of this. By stealing the reclamators, he's acting in his own self-interest at the expense of the rest of our people.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>KIRA:  I know Shakaar. He's one of the most selfless people I have ever met. He must have a good reason for what he's done.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>WINN:  Perhaps. Perhaps he is just misguided. That's why I've come to you, Kira. You know him, you can talk to him. I don't want this to become a scandal. I want this settled peacefully, quietly. Surely we can both agree that that's a worthy goal.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>KIRA:  I'll talk to him, but I can't guarantee that he'll listen to me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>WINN:  Vedek Bareil used to tell me that you could be quite persuasive when you put your mind to it, child. I hope he wasn't mistaken. Walk with the Prophets.</td></tr>
