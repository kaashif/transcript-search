<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  I guess they got tired of looking at our backs. Three months of bloody slaughter and what have we got to show for it? Not a damn thing. Engage, retreat, engage, retreat. Just once I would've liked to have gotten a look at their backs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>SISKO:  Chief, that's enough.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>DAX:  I wouldn't worry just yet. The Tyra system is far enough away that it'll be a day or two before we get any message.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>GARAK:  Well look at you. You act as if you haven't a care in the world. It's exactly that kind of smug, superior attitude that makes people like you so unpopular.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>GARAK:  A thirty two point seven percent chance of survival. I call that insulting.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Don't take it so personally, Garak. It's strictly a matter of mathematics.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>GARAK:  No, it's strictly a matter of our lives. You're not genetically engineered. You're a Vulcan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>MARTOK:  Now that that's settled, I'm going to take care of this. Klingons make great warriors but terrible doctors.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>SOMEONE: Permanent Documentation File, Dukat, SG. Each day brings reports of new victories. The war continues to go well. The enemy is retreating on almost all fronts. It's only a matter of time before the Federation collapses and Earth becomes another conquered planet under Dominion rule. All in all, it's a good time for Cardassia, and the Dominion.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  My dear Major Kira, you have no idea how it pleases me to hear you say that. Dukat, the Major has just given me the most wonderful news. Bajorans are returning to the station.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>DUKAT:  I'm well aware of it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  Then I'm sure you share my delight in knowing that life here is returning to normal. The shops are reopening, the Promenade is abuzz with activity once again. The Habitat ring echoes with the laughter of happy children.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>DAMAR:  I've doubled security patrols throughout the station.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  Are such precautions really necessary?</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>DUKAT:  I've found that one can't be too careful when dealing with the Bajorans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>KIRA:  What's wrong, Dukat? Afraid we'll take the station away from you again?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>DAMAR:  You're welcome to try.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  Come now, come now, there's no need for this petty bickering. We're all friends here.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>KIRA:  Are we.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  Of course we are. And if you have any suggestions, Major, feel free to bring them to me at any time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>KIRA:  Fine. We'd like the station's Bajoran security force reinstated.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>DAMAR:  I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>DUKAT:  The station no longer requires a Bajoran security force. Our troops can handle any problems that might arise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>KIRA:  The Federation and Bajor always shared equal responsibility for station security. I thought you said that we would have the same arrangement with the Dominion. After all, we are all friends here, aren't we?</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  Perhaps you should reconsider your decision.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>DUKAT:  The order stands. You may trust the Bajorans, but I don't. And until they earn my trust, I prefer to keep them unarmed. And if you were in my position, Major, you would do exactly the same thing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  Perhaps it would be best to let the matter rest for a while. I'm sure in time, We'll be able to resolve all these minor problems to our mutual satisfaction.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  In the future, it might be prudent for you to include me in all decisions relating to station policy. Now, what about the wormhole? You assured me that you would be able to dismantle the minefield within a month. That was two months ago.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>DUKAT:  Well, I admit the work is proceeding more slowly than expected, but as you know, these are not ordinary mines. Every time we deactivate or destroy one of them, its neighbour replicates a new one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  We have to take down that minefield and reopen the wormhole.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>DUKAT:  And we will. But there's no need for panic. We are winning the war.</td></tr>

<tr id="L110"><td><a href="#L110">110</a></td><td>WEYOUN:  For the moment, yes. But to defeat the Federation, we're going to need reinforcements and new supplies of ketracel-white. Soon.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>QUARK:  Good evening, gentlemen. Once again I see you're at your usual table. It's amazing how many of my customers think of Quark's as their second home. I only wish I had a holo-imager so I could preserve this warm and wonderful moment of camaraderie. Something you could hang on the wall of your barracks. (no response) Have you tried the dabo tables? I'm sure one of my lovely hostesses would be happy to teach you the game. (zilch) I know. A complimentary hour in one of our state-of-the-art holosuites? Whatever your desires, I'm sure we can satisfy them. (a Look) Perhaps another time. Enjoy the evening.</td></tr>

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>KIRA:  I'm telling you, Odo, Dukat has only one thing on his mind, and that's revenge. He can't stand the thought that Bajor defeated Cardassia.</td></tr>

<tr id="L120"><td><a href="#L120">120</a></td><td>KIRA:  Maybe. Weyoun's a hard one to figure out. I don't really trust him but I trust him more than Dukat.</td></tr>

<tr id="L121"><td><a href="#L121">121</a></td><td>ODO:  Weyoun knows that it's in the Dominion's best interest to honour its treaty with Bajor. They want to prove to the rest of the Alpha Quadrant that they're true to their word.</td></tr>

<tr id="L122"><td><a href="#L122">122</a></td><td>KIRA:  Weyoun asked me about you. He seemed very concerned about what you thought of him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L124"><td><a href="#L124">124</a></td><td>KIRA:  He'd be hurt to hear you said that. I'll have to mention it to him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L128"><td><a href="#L128">128</a></td><td>KIRA:  No, it's true. When I talk to you, things don't seem as bad. When I think of Dukat in the Captain's office, or the fact that the Federation seems to be losing this war and we're here doing nothing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L129"><td><a href="#L129">129</a></td><td>ODO:  I share your frustration, Major, but right now there's really nothing we can do but bide our time. It's like Captain Sisko said. Bajor must be kept out of the fighting.</td></tr>

<tr id="L130"><td><a href="#L130">130</a></td><td>KIRA:  And who am I to argue with the Emissary.</td></tr>

<tr id="L133"><td><a href="#L133">133</a></td><td>QUARK:  The usual. Peace, love and understanding. Not to mention a generous profit margin, which I'm happy to say is looking more and more likely. You know, I never expected to say this, but as occupations go, this one's not so bad.</td></tr>

<tr id="L134"><td><a href="#L134">134</a></td><td>KIRA:  No, I suppose that's true if all you're worried about is a monthly balance sheet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L135"><td><a href="#L135">135</a></td><td>QUARK:  I'm not just concerned with profit, Major. Look around. Do you see any ghetto fences dividing the Promenade? Or exhausted Bajoran slave labourers sprawled on the ground after a gruelling day in the Ore Processing Centre? Do you hear the cries of starving children? I don't. Now don't get me wrong, I miss the Federation too. All I'm saying is, things could be a lot worse.</td></tr>

<tr id="L136"><td><a href="#L136">136</a></td><td>ODO:  I hate to say this, but he's right. The Dominion seems determined to prove that it can be a friend to Bajor.</td></tr>
