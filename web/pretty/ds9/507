<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>QUARK:  Afraid you'd lose? You know, Odo, I used to think all your problems stemmed from the fact that you were a changeling, isolated from your own kind, forced to live among strangers who didn't understand you. You couldn't eat, you couldn't drink, you couldn't sleep, you couldn't make love. Was it any wonder you had such a bad disposition? But you're not a changeling anymore. You're one of us. Life is yours for the taking. All you have to do is reach out and grab it. But do you? No. Because solid or changeling, you're still a miserable, self-hating misanthrope. That's who you are and that's who you'll always be.</td></tr>

Her hands moved to the brooch at her throat. She unclasped it and the cloak fell from her shoulders, her wet skin glistening in the moonlight.

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>QUARK:  Odo, I take it all back. You're obviously a lot more complicated than I thought. If you like that kind of thing I might be interested in selling you my first edition of 'Vulcan Love Slave.'</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>ODO:  This is work, not recreation. Books like this give me insight into the criminal mind. It is a well known fact that a high percentage of homicides are motivated by romantic obsession.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>QUARK:  Well, no one gets killed in 'Vulcan Love Slave,' but it's still a hell of a read.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>ODO:  Give it up, Quark. You can annoy me, bait me, question my very existence, but in the end, we both know I've won.
