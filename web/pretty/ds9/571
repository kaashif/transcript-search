<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  We're not really sure. The only thing we can figure is that just prior to the engagement, their Chief Engineer adjusted the tritium intermix to compensate for a containment problem in the warp core.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>SISKO:  They may have failed to capture Rondac, but their attack sent a message to the Cardassian people. If the rebels can show them that they have a chance of succeeding, their support will grow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>SISKO:  Yes, but they have to adjust their tactics. Concentrate on small scale hit and run attacks, sabotaging key facilities.</td></tr>

We Cardassians are a proud people. Losing Bajor to a ragtag band of terrorists, no offence, was a humiliation. Simply put, taking on a Bajoran officer as an advisor would undermine his authority.</td></tr>
