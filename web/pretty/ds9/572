The population must understand in no uncertain terms that dissent will not be tolerated. Then I want you to begin putting Cardassian civilians in and around Dominion military installations. If Damar destroys another shipyard, he will have to kill a great many of his countrymen as well. This will help turn the people against him.</td></tr>
