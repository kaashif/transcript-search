I can't talk to anyone else. Not even to Dax. Maybe if I just lay it all out in my log, it'll finally make sense. I can see where it all went wrong. Where I went wrong. I suppose it started two weeks ago,</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>SISKO [OC]:  While I was posting the weekly casualty list in the wardroom. Every Friday morning for the past three months, I've posted the official list of Starfleet personnel killed, wounded or missing in the war.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Everyone looks for names they know. Don't look too closely, names are repeated. Captain Margaret Clark is there six times.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>SISKO [OC]:  It's become something of a grim ritual around here. Not a week goes by that someone doesn't find the name of a loved one, a friend or an acquaintance on that damned list.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Dax finds a name.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>SISKO [OC]:  I've grown to hate Fridays.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>SISKO:  Who is it, Dax?</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>DAX:  Leslie Wong.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>SISKO:  The skipper of the Cairo?</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>DAX:  She was an instructor at the Academy when I was a sophomore.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Do you know what happened to the Cairo?</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>SISKO:  Just that she disappeared on patrol in the Romulan neutral zone. I'll look into it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>DAX:  Don't bother. I'm sure it's the same old story. The Jem'Hadar crossed the Romulan border and caught them by surprise. It's only about the hundredth time it's happened.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>BASHIR:  I can't believe the Romulans allow them to violate their territory so brazenly. Why do they get away with it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>SISKO:  The Romulans have a treaty of non-aggression and friendship with the Dominion, so they're willing to turn a blind eye to almost anything in the name of friendship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>BASHIR:  What we need is to bring the Romulans into the war on our side. With the combined forces of the Federation, the Klingons and the Romulans we could finally go on the offensive.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>DAX:  That's the last thing the Romulans want. Think about it. They're in the perfect position. They get to sit back and watch as their biggest rivals slug it out in a long, bloody war. No one's threatening their interests. Why should they risk their necks? There's simply no reason for them to get involved in our war. No reason at all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>SISKO [OC]:  That was the moment I made the decision. It was like I had stepped through a door and locked it behind me. I was going to bring the Romulans into the war.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Captain's office</td></tr>
<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>SISKO:  It's in their own best interest to join the war, that's the key. That's the reason the Romulans will finally take action. Not to do us any favours, but to protect themselves from the Dominion.</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>DAX:  Okay. Let's say I'm the Romulan Proconsul. From where I'm sitting, the Dominion isn't a threat to me. I have a non-aggression pact with them. They're my allies.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>SISKO:  You're not going to put your faith in some piece of paper, are you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>DAX:  Not at all. I've been watching them very closely since the beginning of the war, and so far, they've kept their part of the bargain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>SISKO:  They're violating your territory almost every day. What kind of an ally is that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>DAX:  So they're crossing my backyard to give the Federation a bloody nose. I can't say that makes me very sad.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>SISKO:  You can't be naive enough to think that the Dominion is going to stop with the Federation. When they're finished with us, they're be coming after you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>DAX:  That's speculation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>SISKO:  The Founders see it as their sacred duty to bring order to the galaxy. Their order. Do you think they'll sit idly by while you keep your chaotic empire right next to their perfect order? No. If you watch us go under, then what you're really doing is signing your own death warrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>DAX:  But before I plunge my people into a conflict that will kill millions of loyal Romulan citizens, I need something more concrete than the self-serving argument of a Starfleet officer. I need proof of Dominion duplicity. Not more words, proof.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>SISKO:  Very good, old man. You would have made a decent Romulan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>DAX:  I prefer the spots to the pointed ears.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>SISKO:  Okay, you've convinced me. They're going to need evidence. But if there is evidence of a Dominion plan to attack Romulus, it's probably buried deep in the bowels of their headquarters on Cardassia Prime.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>DAX:  Not exactly the most accessible place in the galaxy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L36"><td><a href="#L36">36</a></td><td>SISKO:  Not for us, maybe. But there is someone on this station who specialises in gaining access to places where he is not welcome.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Wardroom</td></tr>
<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>GARAK:  I must say I'm flattered, Captain. I had no idea you held such a lofty opinion of me. Your faith in my ability to retrieve classified information from my former homeland is most gratifying.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>SISKO:  Mister Garak, let's dispense with the usual repartee and concentrate on the issue at hand. Can you do it or not?</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>GARAK:  No one wants to see the Dominion destroyed more than I do, but to go to Cardassia Prime, penetrate one of the most heavily guarded facilities in the quadrant, steal top secret war plans and then return them safely to you is not just another job. It's more like a suicide mission. And that is well outside my field of expertise.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>SISKO:  I didn't say you had to go there yourself. I have to believe that a man like you still has a few contacts at home. A colleague from the Obsidian Order, an old friend, a reliable informant. Someone who might owe you a favour.</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>GARAK:  Perhaps.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>SISKO:  Then I'd say it's time to call in a favour.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>GARAK:  It would mean calling in all my favours, Captain. To do what you're asking would use up every resource I have left on Cardassia. And it may be a very messy, very bloody business. Are you prepared for that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>SISKO:  I posted my fourteenth casualty list this morning. I'm already involved in a very messy, very bloody business. And the only way I can see to end it is to bring the Romulans into the war. I am prepared to do whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, but I can't do it alone. I need help. Now, are you in or out?</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>GARAK:  I'm in.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>SISKO [OC]:  My father used to say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Sisko's quarters</td></tr>
<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>SISKO:  I laid the first stone right there. I'd committed myself. I'd pay any price, go to any lengths, because my cause was righteous. My intentions were good. In the beginning, that seemed like enough.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Sisko's bedroom</td></tr>
<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>SISKO [OC]:  If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that bad news invariably comes in the middle of the night.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>KIRA [OC]:  Kira to Captain Sisko.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>SISKO:  Go ahead, Major.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>KIRA [OC]:  We just received a priority one communication from Starfleet Command. The Dominion has invaded Betazed.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Ops</td></tr>
<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>SISKO:  According to initial reports, the invasion force must have come from somewhere in the Calandra Sector.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>DAX:  Did Starfleet Intelligence know anything about the buildup?</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>WORF:  No. They believed Calandra was too far from the Dominion supply lines to be a threat.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>SISKO:  There's plenty of blame to go around. The Tenth Fleet was supposed to be protecting Betazed and its outlying colonies, but it was caught out of position on a training exercise. What's worse, Betazed's own defence systems are obsolete and undermanned. The planet was theirs in less than ten hours.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>KIRA:  With Betazed in the hands of the Jem'Hadar, the Dominion is in a position to threaten Vulcan, Andor, Tellar, Alpha Centauri.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>GARAK:  Well I suppose that depends on how you look at it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>SISKO:  This is how I look at it is. Betazed has just fallen to the Dominion and we need to get this operation underway.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>GARAK:  I share your desire for swift action, Captain. In fact, after our last conversation, I made a few discreet inquiries among my former associates still living on Cardassia. As I anticipated, they shared my loathing for the current government and were willing to take on an assignment aimed at its destruction.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>SISKO:  That sounds like progress to me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>GARAK:  Doesn't it? Unfortunately, they're all dead now.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>SISKO:  What?</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>GARAK:  Yes. All killed within one day of speaking with me. I suppose that's a testament to the effectiveness of Dominion security. One should admire such efficiency.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>SISKO:  I'm sorry.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>GARAK:  I hope you're not giving up that easily. After all, the stakes are much higher than a few dead operatives. The fate of the entire quadrant hangs in the balance. Or at least that's the case you made to me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>SISKO:  Do you have another plan?</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>GARAK:  As a matter of fact, I do. But I suspect you won't like it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>SISKO:  Try me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>GARAK:  If you want to guarantee that we obtain evidence of a Dominion plan to attack the Romulans, I suggest that we manufacture that evidence ourselves.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Sisko's quarters</td></tr>
<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>SISKO:  Maybe I should have put a stop to it right there. Maybe I should have said, thank you very much for your input, Mister Garak. I will take your suggestion under advisement, and gone back to my office and forgotten about the whole thing. But I didn't. Because in my heart, I knew what he was saying made sense.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Garak's shop</td></tr>
<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>GARAK:  His name is Vreenak. He's been a key member of the Romulan Senate for the past fourteen years. He's Secretary of the War Plans Council, Vice Chairman of the Tal Shiar, and one of the most trusted advisors to Proconsul Neral.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>SISKO:  He's also the man that negotiated the non-aggression pact with the Dominion.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>GARAK:  Since you're familiar with him, I'll skip the rest of his biography. What's important is that he continues to be one of the most ardently pro-Dominion voices in the Senate. If we can convince him that the Dominion is a threat, the rest of the Senate will follow.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>SISKO:  All right, how?</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>GARAK:  Ten days from now, Senator Vreenak will be making a trip to Soukara for a diplomatic meeting with Weyoun. I am certain that he can be persuaded to make a secret detour to DS Nine if he were invited by one Captain Benjamin Sisko.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>SISKO:  How do you know he'll be visiting Soukara?</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>GARAK:  There are some things I'd rather not discuss. May I continue?</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>SISKO:  Please.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>GARAK:  When Senator Vreenak arrives, you will show him a holographic recording of a secret meeting held at the highest level of the Dominion in which the planned invasion of Romulus is being discussed. You will tell the Senator that this information was obtained through various covert means at great cost to the Federation. At least ten good men lost their lives bringing it across the line, that sort of thing. He will immediately suspect it's a forgery, but you will assure him that such a thing would be impossible. You see, Senator, this is an official Cardassian transcript. It was recorded on a one time optolythic data rod used for official record keeping. These rods are manufactured only as needed on Cardassia Prime. Information can only be transcribed on them once, and then cannot be altered.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>SISKO:  He'll want to examine it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>GARAK:  Of course. And he will discover to his amazement that it's completely genuine. At least, so it will appear.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>SISKO:  But in reality?</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>GARAK:  You will have handed him a genuine optolythic data rod, but it will contain one of the most perfect forgeries ever fashioned. I'm still working on obtaining the data rod, but I have located the man who will create the holorecording.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>SISKO:  You realise I can't authorise a thing like this on my own. I'll have to clear it with Starfleet Command.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>GARAK:  Of course. But I suspect that with the fall of Betazed, they'll be ready to do whatever it takes to bring the Romulans into the war.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>SISKO:  I'll let you know.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>GARAK:  One last thing, Captain. The man we need to forge this holoprogramme is currently sitting in a Klingon prison awaiting execution. To save time and incidentally his life, I thought that perhaps you could contact Chancellor Gowron today and arrange a pardon.</td></tr>

Fifteen minutes later, he ordered a second bottle, then a third. Halfway through his fourth bottle he decided to dance with M'Pella. She was otherwise engaged running the dabo wheel and declined his invitation. He decided to force the issue. A brief struggle ensued and Quark, in an uncharacteristic display of chivalry, attempted to intervene, so Tolar stabbed him. Normally, he'd be sitting in a holding cell, but he claims he's a friend of yours.</td></tr>

<tr id="L271"><td><a href="#L271">271</a></td><td>GARAK:  Oh, but I think that there is. You see, when the Tal Shiar finishes examining the wreckage of Vreenak's shuttle, they'll find the burnt remnants of a Cardassian optolythic data rod which somehow miraculously survived the explosion. After painstaking forensic examination, they'll discover that the rod contains a recording of a high level Dominion meeting at which the invasion of Romulus was being planned.</td></tr>

<tr id="L272"><td><a href="#L272">272</a></td><td>SISKO:  And then they'll discover that it is a fraud!</td></tr>

<tr id="L273"><td><a href="#L273">273</a></td><td>GARAK:  No, I don't think they will, because any imperfections in the forgery will appear to be a result of the explosion. So, with a seemingly legitimate rod in one hand and a dead senator in the other, I ask you, Captain, what conclusion would you draw?</td></tr>

<tr id="L274"><td><a href="#L274">274</a></td><td>SISKO:  That Vreenak obtained the rod on Soukara and that the Dominion killed him to prevent him from returning to Romulus with it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L275"><td><a href="#L275">275</a></td><td>GARAK:  Precisely. And the more the Dominion protests their innocence, the more the Romulans will believe they're guilty because it's exactly what the Romulans would have done in their place. That's why you came to me, isn't it, Captain? Because you knew I could do those things that you weren't capable of doing. Well, it worked. And you'll get what you want, a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant and all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal, and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L276"><td><a href="#L276">276</a></td><td>SISKO:  At oh eight hundred hours, station time, the Romulan Empire formally declared war against the Dominion. They have already struck fifteen bases along the Cardassian border. So, this is a huge victory for the good guys. This may even be the turning point of the entire war. There's even a 'Welcome to the Fight' party tonight in the wardroom. So I lied, I cheated, I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. But most damning thing of all, I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again, I would. Garak was right about one thing. A guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant, so I will learn to live with it. Because I can live with it. I can live with it. Computer, erase that entire personal log.</td></tr>
