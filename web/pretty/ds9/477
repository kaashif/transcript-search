I hope you don't take this the wrong way, Major, but I've always admired you. You are the embodiment of the new Bajor. A Bajoran born out of the ashes of the occupation, a Bajoran tempered with Cardassian steel.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>KIRA:  Captain Sisko's right. You are in love with the sound of your own voice.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>DUKAT:  I have no desire to debate the merits of the Occupation with you. I'm even willing to admit that perhaps we were a little harsh in our methods. But the fact is, the Bajoran people are stronger now than they have been in centuries. When we arrived, you were a weak, contemplative race, choking on your isolation. And now you have a new confidence, a whole new sense of purpose, not to mention a key role in the future of this entire quadrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>KIRA:  All of which Bajor achieved in spite of the Cardassians, not because of them.</td></tr>
