<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>SISKO:  I can imagine. What's on the agenda?</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>KIRA:  USS Potemkin has completed her repairs and is rejoining the fleet later today.

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>MARTOK:  And you did nothing to stop it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>SISKO:  No. In fact, I recommended you for the position myself. Allow me to offer my congratulations to the new Supreme Commander of the Ninth Fleet.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>MARTOK:  Do you have any idea how much paperwork a Supreme Commander has to do?</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>MARTOK:  No, I'll keep my flag aboard the Rotarran. It may be cramped, but at least I'll feel like I'm still in the war. By the way, I'd like Worf to continue functioning as my principal Intelligence Officer.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>SISKO:  I don't see any problem with that. He's the only officer I know who can never get enough work.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>MARTOK:  At least if he's busy he'll stop going on about this wedding of his. There were times aboard the Rotarran he nearly drove me mad. Until his son arrived, it was all he could talk about. Then Alexander became all he could talk about. The man is nothing if not single-minded.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>WORF:  He did.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>ALEXANDER:  I flooded the entire deck with superheated hydraulic fluid. It took me three days to clean it up, but I swear it still smells like burnt dog hair in there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>ALEXANDER:  The Rotarran's crew actually thinks of me as a good luck charm. You know, the more mistakes I make, the safer they feel. I hope the Ya'Vang's crew feels the same way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>WORF:  The Ya'Vang?</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>ALEXANDER:  I got new orders this morning. The battle cruiser Ya'Vang took heavy losses in their last engagement so most of the Rotarran's crew are being transferred there at the end of the week, including me. More bloodwine?</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>DAX:  Why not?</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>WORF:  Wait. I thought we had agreed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>DAX:  We did, but I would hate for Alexander to miss his father's wedding. It would mean so much to him, and besides, it may be a long time before you see him again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>ALEXANDER:  What's going on?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>WORF:  Our wedding plans have changed. We are getting married here on Deep Space Nine. And I want you to be my Tawi'Yan.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>DAX:  Sword-bearer. It's sort of like a best man.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>ALEXANDER:  Me? Really? Oh, that's great!</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: He throws out his arms and hits a waiter's tray which crashes onto a table.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>DAX:  it doesn't leave much time to make all the arrangements, but fortunately there isn't that much left to do. Worf's been planning the ceremony for the last three months. He has everything figured out, right down to the colour of my shoes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>KIRA:  No offence, Jadzia, but it seems like this wedding is all about what Worf wants. Habitat ring, section fifty one gamma. What about you?</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>DAX:  A traditional Klingon wedding with all the trimmings is something Worf's been thinking about since he was a boy. It probably has something to do with being raised by human parents. In any case, when it comes to Klingon tradition, Worf is very sentimental.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>KIRA:  Worf?</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>DAX:  All men are sentimental. They just cover it up with scowls and clenched jaws. There are times when Worf literally gets misty-eyed talking about Klingon rituals.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>LOCATION--Corridor</td></tr>
<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>KIRA:  So that's why you're letting him make the plans for the wedding?</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>DAX:  Mostly, but the truth is, I've gone through five Trill ceremonies three as a bride, two as a groom, and I'm a little bored with it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Odo swerves down a side corridor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>DAX:  Is it my imagination, or did Odo just try and avoid us?</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>KIRA:  I didn't notice. We've been avoiding each other ever since the Dominion left the station. I think we're both afraid of talking about what happened during the occupation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>DAX:  What do you mean?</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>KIRA:  To tell you the truth, it's nothing I want to talk about right now either.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>WORF:  Thank you for coming. As you probably know by now, Jadzia and I will be married here on the station in six days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>BASHIR:  There's nothing more romantic than a wedding on DS Nine in springtime.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>WORF:  By tradition, the Klingon man spends the four nights before his wedding on a mental and spiritual journey. It is called Kal'Hyah, the path of clarity. And he is accompanied by his closest male friends.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>MARTOK:  You cannot imagine the experience that awaits us. Four long nights filled with song and fellowship. A time of unbridled pleasures.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Are we talking about a bachelor party?</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>WORF:  It is a similar ritual.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>MARTOK:  By marrying Worf, Dax will be joining the House of Martok. Since the Mistress of a Great House must approve all marriages, Sirella will spend the next four days evaluating Jadzia.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>MARTOK:  I shall endeavour to die this year, if possible. Allow me to present Captain Benjamin Sisko, Commander of Deep Space Nine. Captain, may I present the Mistress of the House of Martok, my wife and the mother of my children, Sirella, daughter of Linkasa.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Yup, they're deeply in love. I'm thinking Benedick and Beatrice from [1]Much Ado About Nothing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>DAX:  Yes, Worf. I travelled to Kronos, I captured three targs in the Hamar Mountains, made the ritual sacrifice at dawn, came back to the station, asked Quark to boil their shoulders into tallow. Then I spent two days molding them into candles with my own hands.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>SIRELLA:  I doubt that. A Klingon woman would find it difficult to gain my favour. For an alien, it will most likely be impossible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>MARTOK:  We are Klingons, Worf. We don't embrace other cultures, we conquer them. If someone wishes to join us, they must honour our traditions and prove themselves worthy of wearing the crest of a great House.</td></tr>

She has had five marriages, this would be my first. When she is laughing, I am sombre. When I am happy, she is crying. She plays tongo with the Ferengi bartender. I can barely stand him. She mocks everything, while I take everything seriously. She is nothing like the woman I thought I would marry.</td></tr>

Do you think Sirella is anything like the woman I thought that I'd marry? She is a prideful, arrogant, mercurial woman who shares my bed far too infrequently for my taste. And yet I love her deeply. We Klingons often tout our prowess in battle, our desire for honour and glory above all else. But how hollow is the sound of victory without someone to share it with. Honour gives little comfort to a man alone in his home and in his heart.</td></tr>
