In fifty two hours you need to be at this rendezvous point outside the Badlands. You are the escort for a Federation troop convoy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L37"><td><a href="#L37">37</a></td><td>WORF:  It will take twelve hours just to arrive at the coordinates where the Honshu was destroyed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>KIRA:  And twelve more to reach the Badlands, I know. But this convoy is completely unprotected. They've been using the plasma fields in the Badlands to hide their movements, and when they emerge they're helpless without the Defiant.</td></tr>

The engines were damaged from the shockwaves and I set us down here, wherever here is. But that shuttle's never going to reach orbit again. The shuttle's distress beacon was damaged, but I think I managed to repair it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>DUKAT:  It's a general distress call, Benjamin. Whoever gets here first will find one comrade in arms and one prisoner. That's fair, isn't it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>DUKAT:  You shattered most of the bones in your arm. There was a bone regenerator in the medkit, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a doctor, so I just put on the cast.</td></tr>

The surface is inhospitable to say the least, but I did manage to find some firewood and kindling, so there's a good chance there's edible vegetation out there. I just have to find it.</td></tr>

I'm free and you're a prisoner of your own battered body, and there's a good chance we'll be rescued by the Dominion. You've got to laugh at a universe that allows such radical shifts in fortune, Benjamin.</td></tr>
