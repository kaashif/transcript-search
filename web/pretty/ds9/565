<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>CRETAK:  Repairs on our ships have continually been delayed in favour of Klingon and Federation vessels. The Dividices and the Genorex have been waiting almost three weeks while more than a dozen Klingon ships have been given first priority.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>SLOAN:  Section Thirty one is extremely interested in this conference of yours. However, the Tal'Shiar will be handling the security arrangements, so we have virtually no chance of using any technical assets to gather intelligence. As a result, we'll be forced to rely on organic assets, like you. Your mission is to gather data on the Romulan leadership. In essence, we want you to take the pulse of their government. No pun intended.</td></tr>

The Dominion will be forced back to the Gamma Quadrant, the Cardassian Empire will be occupied, the Klingon Empire will spend the next ten years recovering from the war and won't pose a serious threat to anyone. That leaves two powers to vie for control of the quadrant, the Federation and the Romulans.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>SISKO:  Can't say I'm surprised. From what we've seen of them, Section Thirty one is very meticulous in covering their tracks.

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>BASHIR:  What about me?</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>SISKO:  Starfleet Command has promised to send the expert on Dominion biogenic weapons and Ketracel white to the conference. Since that's you, you go. And we want you to carry out your assignment. Make a few discreet observations on the Romulan leadership and then wait for Sloan to contact you again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Somehow, I don't think giving Sloan any information is a good idea.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>SISKO:  That was my instinct as well, but after talking to Ross I think we might have an opportunity here we can turn to our advantage. Officially, Starfleet Command has said that they are appalled at the very notion that an organisation like Section Thirty one might exist, and that they plan to get to the bottom of this entire business.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>BASHIR:  And unofficially?</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>SISKO:  They have quietly pushed the investigation aside, which means either they don't take Section Thirty one seriously or someone at Starfleet Command is protecting them. Either way, we now have a chance to get someone inside and I think I want to take it.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>SISKO:  Exactly. When he contacts you to find out what you learned at the conference, make it seem like you've reluctantly come around to his way of thinking. Let him believe that he has seduced you into helping him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>BASHIR:  That shouldn't be too difficult. Sloan thinks I'm already so tempted that I can barely can see straight. Well, listen, I'd better packed. The Bellerophon leaves in three hours.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>SISKO:  One more thing, Doctor. Remember this isn't a game. Section Thirty one is very dangerous. If Sloan suspects that you are really working for us.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>SLOAN:  It's a line from an old Earth poem. Forgive me for interrupting. I couldn't help overhearing and etymology is one of my hobbies. The phrase 'never say die' is originally from a nineteenth century poem based on Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice.' Now, it's since passed into the vernacular as an exhortation never to give up, no matter the cost.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>BASHIR:  That doesn't surprise me he has a solid cover story, sir. But I think it's too dangerous to allow him to participate in the conference or even set foot on Romulus. We don't know what he's up to.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>ROSS:  On the other hand, if we move against him now, we lose any hope of penetrating Section Thirty one. His access at this conference will be limited to a few low level briefings and seminars. It shouldn't be hard keeping tabs on him. If Sloan's here it suggests more important than a simple intelligence gathering mission. He's up to something and it's imperative that we know what that something is. We go forward.</td></tr>

<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>SLOAN:  The proof is buried somewhere in Koval's personal database, which puts it out of our reach for now. But believe me, Doctor, the Deputy Chief of Starfleet Intelligence doesn't just die of food poisoning. I have to give him credit though. It was a textbook operation. No sign of foul play, and certainly no sign of Romulan involvement. It was very tidy. Koval's political status?</td></tr>

<tr id="L114"><td><a href="#L114">114</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Ambiguous. He hasn't been elevated to the Continuing Committee, which is usually a given for the head of the Tal'Shiar. His nomination's probably being held up because of his opposition to the Federation Alliance, which is supported by the majority on the Committee.</td></tr>

<tr id="L115"><td><a href="#L115">115</a></td><td>SLOAN:  Which, in turn, opens the door for your friend, Senator Cretak. She's an advocate of the alliance and she's been lobbying for this open seat.

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>BASHIR:  I'm familiar with it. It's a neurological disease which affects mainly Romulans, Vulcans and Rigelians. It's degenerative and incurable at present.</td></tr>

<tr id="L117"><td><a href="#L117">117</a></td><td>SLOAN:  If Koval is ill, he'll try to hide it. It's a weakness, and one that could hamper his chances of being appointed to the Committee.</td></tr>

Sloan, in fact, works for Starfleet Intelligence. Far from being the master of a rogue agency, he is simply one of many operatives in the employ of the Federation. He's had a long career, most of which is still unknown to us. However, there is one interesting element that we do know. He was the protg of the late Vice Admiral Fujisaki. Sloan did not take the death of his mentor well. He came to believe he was murdered by the Tal'Shiar. In his eyes, the assassination of a Starfleet admiral was stepping over the line. Isn't that the phrase? After Fujisaki's death, he was confronted with a dilemma. How could he seek vengeance without violating the Federation laws? His answer was to invent Section Thirty one, a rogue</td></tr>

<tr id="L281"><td><a href="#L281">281</a></td><td>SOMEONE: organisation that answered to no one. If they killed the head of the Tal'Shiar, Starfleet Intelligence would be held blameless. As the Committee knows, I have been diagnosed with Tuvan Syndrome. Sloan became aware of my condition and hoped to make my death look like a sudden acceleration of the disease. To do that, he needed a doctor. Sloan arranged to recruit Doctor Bashir into Section Thirty one. After that, Sloan bided his time, and waited for an opportunity to present itself. He found one when he learned of this conference. He then arranged for Bashir to be invited. Everything was going perfectly, but then he made a fatal mistake. He decided to come to Romulus himself. He was unaware that his identity had become known to us. Once we recognised him in the delegation, we knew immediately that an intelligence operation was underway. What I don't understand is why? Why did you come here and take the risk of being discovered?</td></tr>

It is entirely possible she would welcome my death, especially if it meant her being elevated to the Continuing Committee in my place.</td></tr>

You were the one who issued the orders preventing me from contacting Deep Space Nine.
