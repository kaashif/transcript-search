<tr id="L113"><td><a href="#L113">113</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Yes. And I tend to discount the possibility that it is a natural ability. His biomolecular diffusion gradient already suggests that his cellular mitosis has been artificially enhanced.</td></tr>

<tr id="L116"><td><a href="#L116">116</a></td><td>SISKO:  I want you to test his mental abilities. See if they increase. Maybe he'll get to the point where he can tell us who he is and where he's comes from.</td></tr>
