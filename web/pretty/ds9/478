<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>QUARK:  I knew it couldn't be that simple.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>BASHIR:  The Kahn symbiont which is now joined to Lenara used to be joined to a woman named Nilani, and it was Nilani who married Torias Dax.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>KIRA:  But Torias was killed in a shuttle accident.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>BASHIR:  And Nilani became a widow. Years later, when Nilani died, the Kahn symbiont was joined to Lenara.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>QUARK:  And now Nilani is Lenara, and Torias is Jadzia. So that makes Lenara Jadzia's ex-wife.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>KIRA:  It's a little more complicated than that, Quark.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>QUARK:  I'm sure it is. But to be honest, I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up. It's giving me a headache.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>BASHIR:  It must be all the latinum rattling around in there.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>BASHIR:  I thought so. You really should have that looked at.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>QUARK:  (to a waiter staring in his ear) Get back to work. If you'll excuse me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Quark leaves</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>KIRA:  Did Dax teach you that?</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: They walk to a doorway.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>KIRA:  One thing I don't understand is why Dax and Lenara can't just pick up where they left off. I mean, if they're still in love with each other.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Ah, now there's the rub. Even if they do harbour feelings for each other, it's strictly against the rules of Trill society for them to acknowledge it in any way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>KIRA:  Rules?</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Well, it's more of a taboo, really. Having a relationship with a lover from a past life is called reassociation, and the Trill feel very strongly that it's unnatural.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>KIRA:  Unnatural? How can it be unnatural for a married couple to resume their marriage?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Well, the whole point of joining is for the symbiont to accumulate experiences from the span of many lifetimes. In order to move on from host to host, the symbiont has to learn to let go of the past, let go of parents, siblings, children, even spouses.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>KIRA:  I don't understand how two people who've fallen in love, and made a life together, can be forced to just walk away from each other because of a taboo. There must be some Trill who have reassociated with people from their past lives.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>BASHIR:  I asked Dax the same question, and it seems there have been a few.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>KIRA:  And what happened?</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>BASHIR:  They were exiled from the Trill homeworld.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>KIRA:  That means the symbionts would never be joined to a new host.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Exactly. So when the hosts die, the symbionts die with them. So you see, even if Dax does harbour feelings for Lenara, she can't take that risk. For a joined Trill, nothing is more important than to protect the life of the symbiont. Nothing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>SISKO:  I had a feeling you weren't going to be ready. Curzon was never on time in his life. He was even late for his hundredth birthday party.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>LENARA:  I think Mister Worf is less than enthusiastic about heading a research mission. It's not exactly what every Klingon dreams about.</td></tr>

<tr id="L99"><td><a href="#L99">99</a></td><td>WORF:  Things that would send cold chills down your spine and wake you in the middle of the night. It is better you do not know. Excuse me.</td></tr>
