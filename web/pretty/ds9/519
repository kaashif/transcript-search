In that moment, he knew what was in my mind. Once I realised that he saw my intention to give up, I could no longer go through with it. I went back into the ring and fought once more. He had given me his warrior's heart. Perhaps it is something a human cannot understand.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Serving on a Klingon ship is like being with a gang of ancient sea pirates. You advance in rank by killing the people above you, so everywhere you turn you're surrounded by potential assassins.</td></tr>

<tr id="L68"><td><a href="#L68">68</a></td><td>DAX:  It's not quite that chaotic. The social and military hierarchy of a Klingon vessel's very strictly enforced. A subordinate can only challenge his direct superior and only under certain conditions.</td></tr>
