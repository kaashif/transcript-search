Oh well, that's the price of doing business with a culture that refuses to even acknowledge the concept of time. Though I must say, they make magnificent sweaters. I hope I'm not boring you, Doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Oh, not at all. No, I was just up late last night.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Unfortunately, no. I was reading the last few chapters of The Never-Ending Sacrifice.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>GARAK:  Isn't it superb? Without a doubt the finest Cardassian novel ever written.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>GARAK:  I can't believe that I'm having lunch with a man who thinks The Never-Ending Sacrifice is dull.</td></tr>

<tr id="L15"><td><a href="#L15">15</a></td><td>BASHIR:  I just thought the story got a little redundant after a while. I mean the author's supposed to be chronicling seven generations of a single family, but he tells the same story over and over again. All of his characters lead selfless lives of duty to the state, grow old and die. Then the next generation comes along and does it all over again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L16"><td><a href="#L16">16</a></td><td>GARAK:  But that's exactly the point, Doctor. The repetitive epic is the most elegant form of Cardassian literature, and The Never-Ending Sacrifice is it's greatest achievement.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>BASHIR:  None of his characters ever really come alive, and there's more to life than duty to the state.</td></tr>

But the fungus in this potting soil's almost completely died out. If we can salvage what's left and cultivate a new batch in the lab, that should do the trick.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>DAX:  Maybe he just doesn't like going to see the doctor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>BASHIR:  That's not it. It's that damn Cardassian evasiveness of his. I mean, making me guess about his past is one thing, but when it comes to his health? I don't know. Why can't he just tell me what's going on?</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>BASHIR:  No, of course not. I suppose when it comes right down to it, I don't trust him either. I mean, for all I know, the man is a Cardassian spy.</td></tr>

Computer, display analyses of all biochemical samples taken from the patient in the past thirty-nine hours. Display them by chemical composition. Isolate and display sample number seventeen. Bring up sample twenty three. Sample twenty seven. Sample thirty two. Sample thirty five. Sample forty. Stop. Bring back sample thirty five. Superimpose the molecular structure of this leukocyte with an analogous sample from yesterday. That's it. The molecular structure of Garak's leukocytes has been altered. That must be what's causing the accumulation of toxins in his system.</td></tr>

We were closer than brothers. For some reason, Enabran Tain took a liking to us. Before long, we were both powerful men in the Obsidian Order. They called us the Sons of Tain. Even the Guls feared us. And then there was a scandal. Someone in the Order was accused of letting some Bajoran prisoners escape. There were constant rumours of who was going to be implicated. Fingers were being pointed at me. By then Tain had retired to the Arawath Colony. He couldn't protect me, so I panicked. I did everything in my power to make sure that Elim was accused instead of me. I altered records, planted evidence, only to discover that he'd beaten me to it.</td></tr>
