<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>ALSIA:  When my husband was alive, we ran the business together, and I managed to put away a bit of latinum every year just for myself. Now he's gone, well, I've got quite a little sum.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>MARTUS:  That's important.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>ALSIA:  Well, to be honest, it's not enough. Not for the future. Not for the way I want to live out my retirement. So, I've decided to invest it all. I can't believe I'm telling you this. I just met you but I feel like I can really trust you. It's like I've known you forever.</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>MARTUS:  When hearts are in sympathy, time collapses.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>ALSIA:  I'm taking everything I've saved and I'm purchasing the mining concession on the entire Vlugta asteroid belt.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>MARTUS:  How ambitious. And such an adventurous undertaking for a woman of your delicate sensibilities. Are you sure that's wise? Prospecting can be risky.</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>ALSIA:  Not this time. My father was a stellar cartographer. Thirty years ago, he conducted a full spectrum mineral analysis of those asteroids but he never had the means to follow up on what he found.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>MARTUS:  And now you plan to carry out your father's dream.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>ALSIA:  When his survey results become public, I'll get seven times my investment back overnight. I still can't believe I'm telling you this. My secret plan. I've been thinking about it for years. I never even told my husband. It must be all this Gamzian wine.</td></tr>

<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>MARTUS:  How brave of you to do all of this on your own.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>ALSIA:  It hasn't been easy. There's so much to keep track of, so much to do.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>MARTUS:  Maybe I could help. Would you consider some kind of partnership?</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>MARTUS:  What routine?</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>ODO:  I know all about you El-Aurians. You're listeners. People like to talk to you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>MARTUS:  Everyone has to have someone to confide in, someone to hear their stories I offer a sympathetic ear. And if they request my help I give it to them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>ODO:  That couple from Pythro Five told me you asked for their financial access codes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>MARTUS:  Some might call helping an elderly couple invest their savings a compassionate act.</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>ODO:  Not when you invest it in your own business. A business that promptly folds.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Yeah. Just finished. I missed playing and I figured there'd be at least a couple of other players on board. I didn't think you'd be one of them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>SOMEONE: BASHIR Captain of the team at Starfleet Medical Academy. We took the sector championships in my final year.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Against everybody. Played a Vulcan in the finals. Talk about stamina. I don't think he ever actually broke a sweat.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  And you won?</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Took him on a back wall riser shot.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Well, I can't say I've had much in the way of formal training myself, but it's been a serious pastime for a lot of years.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Some of the toughest players I've come up against didn't really know what they were doing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Really.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Formally I mean. Hey, whatever works, works. This exercise for example, I picked up at a tournament from a top player. It's a five thousand year old battle warm-up. According to the legend, it makes the heart a friend to the hand. Medically, I don't really know what that means, but it seems to give me a lot of energy. Fancy a game?</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Serve.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>COS:  I wasn't always like this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L70"><td><a href="#L70">70</a></td><td>MARTUS:  Of course not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>COS:  I had youth, vigour, fame, wealth beyond measure. All gone.</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>MARTUS:  I'm not listening.</td></tr>

<tr id="L73"><td><a href="#L73">73</a></td><td>COS:  All because of this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>COS:  In a manner of speaking. Every trade deal I struck was a disaster. Every alliance I formed fell apart. Every endeavour backed, a failure.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>MARTUS:  But what does this have to do with the toy? Sounds like you just had a lot of rotten luck.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Cos is slumped against the wall with a look of blissful peace on his face. Martus takes the sphere.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  No, he had a game. I just kind of stumbled around the court for ninety minutes and made a complete ass of myself.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>KEIKO:  I'm sure he didn't see it that way.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  The hell he didn't. That smug look on his face. I guess you prefer old style rules. Like I was some kind of a fossil. In my day, I could've wiped the court with him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>KEIKO:  That's the point. You're not a kid anymore. It's nothing to be ashamed of. People just naturally slow down.</td></tr>

<tr id="L95"><td><a href="#L95">95</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Like molasses in winter, huh? Thanks.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>KEIKO:  Miles, you're taking this way too seriously.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  I'm out of shape, that's all. I just need to get my wind back. Sector Champion, my eye. He's vulnerable to every one of my best shots. I just couldn't get them there. This time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>BASHIR:  No, really. His face was flushed. I could've taken his pulse just watching the side of his neck.</td></tr>

<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Don't think I didn't try. After the first game, I told him I had an appointment. He ignored me. After the second game, I told him I was getting tired. He didn't believe me. And then his racquet broke and I thought, finally. But no. He made me stay there while he went away and replicated another one.</td></tr>

<tr id="L103"><td><a href="#L103">103</a></td><td>DAX:  So what finally happened?</td></tr>

<tr id="L104"><td><a href="#L104">104</a></td><td>BASHIR:  While he was gone, I called my assistant and told her. May I? (gets condiment from another table) Told her to call me back after five minutes and say there was an emergency at the Infirmary.</td></tr>

<tr id="L105"><td><a href="#L105">105</a></td><td>DAX:  That's terrible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L106"><td><a href="#L106">106</a></td><td>BASHIR:  There was no other way out. Otherwise there would have been an emergency. Chief O'Brien's coronary.</td></tr>

<tr id="L107"><td><a href="#L107">107</a></td><td>DAX:  At least it's all over.</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>BASHIR:  That's just it. This is just the beginning. The Chief wants a rematch, and I'm telling you, it's going to kill him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>DAX:  Honestly, Julian, you're exaggerating. O'Brien's can't be a day over thirty eight.</td></tr>

<tr id="L110"><td><a href="#L110">110</a></td><td>BASHIR:  He's too young to die. I guess I'm overstating the health risk. That's not the point. The Chief has a lot of pride, and for good reason. I really respect him, the things he does, the kind of man he is. I just don't want to humiliate him.</td></tr>
