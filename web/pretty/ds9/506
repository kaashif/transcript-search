<tr id="L2"><td><a href="#L2">2</a></td><td>DAX:  It was your idea to attend the conference in the first place, Garak.</td></tr>

<tr id="L3"><td><a href="#L3">3</a></td><td>GARAK:  I thought the Bajorans would be grateful to hear someone provide them with an opposing philosophical view.</td></tr>

<tr id="L4"><td><a href="#L4">4</a></td><td>DAX:  Opposing view? Garak, you were trying to defend the military occupation of their world. How grateful did you think they would be?</td></tr>

<tr id="L5"><td><a href="#L5">5</a></td><td>GARAK:  My understanding of this conference was that it was supposed to be an examination of the occupation from a dispassionate historical perspective. Instead, everyone went out of their way to dismiss virtually everything I had to say.</td></tr>

<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>SISKO:  I thought the Bajorans bent over backwards to be polite to you, Garak.</td></tr>

<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>GARAK:  Giving me a name tag that read, 'Elim Garak, former Cardassian oppressor' was hardly polite.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>DAX:  And what did you want it to say? Former spy?</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>GARAK:  What I would have liked was less posturing and more debate. It's clear to me now that the Bajorans aren't really interested in discovering historical truth as much as they are in promoting the myths and legends of the glorious Resistance.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>DAX:  Well, Odo wasn't a member of the Resistance and he managed to attract a fair amount of attention.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>SISKO:  You need to give yourself more credit, Constable. Keeping order during the Occupation would be a tough job for anyone, but you not only did it, you did it by earning the trust of both sides.</td></tr>

Three days after the executions there was another bombing on the Promenade, identical to the one that almost killed Dukat. Timor, Ishan and Jillur were innocent. All the evidence was there. The inconsistencies in the reports of the soldiers who arrested them, a pattern of bombings, the ballistics. It was all there from the beginning but I was too busy, too concerned with maintaining order and the rule of law. I thought of myself as the outsider, the shape-shifter who cared for nothing but justice. It never occurred to me that I could fail, but I did. And I never wanted anyone to know the truth. That seven years ago, I allowed three innocent men to die.</td></tr>
