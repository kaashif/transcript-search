<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>GARAK:  Yes, but the challenge is determining exactly who is guilty of what. Is Lieutenant Dax throwing one of her surprise parties for you this year?</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Well, in many human cultures, the thirtieth birthday is considered a sort of landmark. It marks the end of youth and the beginning of the slow march into middle age.</td></tr>
