<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>DAX:  I'm getting to that. As a woman, Grilka was forbidden to lead her House. By marrying Quark she was able to retain control through him. Eventually, she convinced the Council to give her control and she divorced Quark on the spot. As far as I know, that's the last time they saw each other.</td></tr>
