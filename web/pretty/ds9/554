<tr id="L12"><td><a href="#L12">12</a></td><td>SOLOK:  Of course I do. But humans are often irked by such precision. Especially the more emotional humans. Our repair list. I understand you were recently honoured with the Christopher Pike Medal for Valour. Congratulations.</td></tr>

<tr id="L13"><td><a href="#L13">13</a></td><td>SISKO:  Thank you. And congratulations to you. I heard you received your Medal last month.</td></tr>

<tr id="L14"><td><a href="#L14">14</a></td><td>SOLOK:  My second, actually. The T'Kumbra has been in combat for over six months. Spending time behind the lines will be a welcome change.</td></tr>

<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>SISKO:  We can upgrade your inertial dampers by the end of the day, but to begin to overhaul your warp core would take at least a week.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>SOLOK:  A somewhat unprofessional attitude. However, I have come to expect a lack of professionalism and efficiency on starbases run by human officers.</td></tr>

I happen to think the people sitting at this table comprise the finest crew in the quadrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>WORF:  Fly. The term for a batted ball while it is in the air.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>KIRA:  Oh, right. Er, fewer than two out, the batter hits a high fly which in the judgment of the umpire can readily be caught by an infielder or the pitcher or catcher inside fair ground. The batter is then called out regardless of whether the ball is subsequently caught or not.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>NOG:  That seems simple enough.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>KIRA:  An attempt to bunt, however, under the conditions noted above, which results in a fair fly shall not be regarded an infield fly. What's a bunt?</td></tr>

Now I know it looks simple. You throw the ball, you catch the ball, you hit the ball. But it is not that easy. It's a difficult game. It was a difficult game to play even for seasoned professionals who spent their lifetime practicing, and now we have less than two weeks to build a team and face the opponent. Now, I know what some of you are thinking. How can we beat the Logicians? They're all Vulcans. They're stronger and faster than any one of us, except for Worf and our genetically enhanced doctor. But there is more to baseball than physical strength. It's about courage, and it's also about faith, and it is also about heart. And if there's one thing our Vulcan friends lack, it's heart. I think we can beat them. I know we can beat them.</td></tr>
