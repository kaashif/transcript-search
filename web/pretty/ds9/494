<tr id="L17"><td><a href="#L17">17</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted.</td></tr>

<tr id="L18"><td><a href="#L18">18</a></td><td>DAX:  How many replicators are we talking about?</td></tr>

<tr id="L19"><td><a href="#L19">19</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Twelve, all class four.</td></tr>

<tr id="L20"><td><a href="#L20">20</a></td><td>KIRA:  The Federation only gave Bajor two CFI replicators.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>DAX:  Why all the secrecy?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>SISKO:  It makes sense. The Cardassian military has been so busy fending off the Klingons, they've basically given a free hand to the Maquis in the Demilitarised zone. The last thing the Maquis are going to want to see is a shipment of replicators on its way to Cardassia.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>WORF:  They should be. Without the Cardassian military to stop them, the Maquis have a perfect opportunity to drive the Cardassians out of the DMZ permanently.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>SISKO:  I take it this shipment is going to pass through Deep Space Nine?</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Yes, sir. In three days.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>SISKO:  All right. Let's tighten security on the station. Step up random checks of incoming and outgoing cargo for weapons or explosives, more deputies on the Promenade. You know the drill.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>ODO:  Understood.</td></tr>

<tr id="L31"><td><a href="#L31">31</a></td><td>SISKO:  Mister Worf, tomorrow I want you to take the Defiant and patrol the Badlands. Show the flag. Let the Maquis know we're ready for any trouble.</td></tr>

<tr id="L39"><td><a href="#L39">39</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station.</td></tr>

<tr id="L40"><td><a href="#L40">40</a></td><td>SISKO:  Oh?</td></tr>

<tr id="L41"><td><a href="#L41">41</a></td><td>ODO:  It's just a theory at this point and frankly, our suspicions are based on purely circumstantial evidence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>SISKO:  Who is it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Again, we're still not certain.</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>SISKO:  I understand that. Who? Gentlemen?</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>ODO:  Kasidy Yates.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: After the titles, when this stunning piece of news has sunk in.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>SISKO:  Kasidy? Working for the Maquis? That's impossible.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>ODO:  I certainly hope so. Smuggling with intent to supply a terrorist organization is a serious offence.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>SISKO:  Where's your evidence?</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>ODO:  Five months ago, Captain Yates was hired by the Bajorans to carry cargo to their outlying colonies. One of her regular runs is from Bajor to a colony on Dreon Seven. It's a twelve hour run for most ships, but she always takes eighteen. The six hour difference is just enough time to allow her to make a side trip into the Badlands, rendezvous with a Maquis ship and then continue on to the Dreon System.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>SISKO:  That's your evidence? That she was slow in one of her deliveries?</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>ODO:  And Captain Yates has been living aboard the station for just under six months.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>SISKO:  That's damned slim evidence to base an accusation.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>ODO:  We haven't made accusations. I said we have suspicions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>SISKO:  That's right. You did say that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>ODO:  Captain, I realise this is an awkward situation for you, but if I could step up my surveillance of Captain Yates?</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>SISKO:  Odo, she's a Federation citizen. You can't just invade her privacy based on your suspicions. You'll have to show me some real evidence before I authorise what you're proposing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>SISKO:  The answer is no.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Understood, sir.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>GARAK:  I simply thought it would be polite to say hello. But clearly, you think I'm incapable of conducting any kind of pleasant discourse without some kind of nefarious ulterior motive.</td></tr>

Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg.
