<tr id="L56"><td><a href="#L56">56</a></td><td>BASHIR:  As far as I can tell, it was exposed to a massive amount of tetryon radiation. I'm going to have to purge the isotopes with an electrophoretic diffuser.</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>ODO:  When I was first discovered, I didn't know what I was. I had no memory of where I was from. I didn't even know I had the ability to mimic other forms.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>ODO:  To find out if the species they encountered posed any threat. What better way to gauge another race than to see how it treats the weak and vulnerable?</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>ODO:  Several months. Why?</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>SISKO:  Well, there's still a lot we don't know about your people. The changelings could provide Starfleet with invaluable information about the Dominion.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>SISKO:  Well, he managed to find a way to communicate with you. He obviously knows what he's doing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>BASHIR:  But I guess you have your own baby to think about. There is still a small degree of instability in its morphogenic matrix. I'm hoping it'll level out. I've set the computer to monitor for biomimetic fluctuations just in case.</td></tr>

You see, I was once like you. I spent months in a lab being prodded and poked by a scientist who didn't recognise I was a lifeform. He thought I was a specimen, a mystery that needed to be unravelled. He never talked to me. It didn't occur to him. I didn't know what I was, or what I was supposed to do. I was lost, alone, but it's not going to be that way with you. No, I'm not going to make the same mistakes that were made with me. Come on, I want to show you something.</td></tr>

Kira is semi-reclined, Y'Pora the midwife holds a round rattle, Keiko has a gentler cylinder rattle that she spins by rubbing the stem between her palms, and O'Brien has a small gong.

You have no idea of the marvels that are in store for you. Do you know what you are? You're a changeling. A shape-shifter. You can be anything. A Tarkalean hawk soaring through the sky, or a Filian python burrowing deep beneath the ground. It's all yours for the taking. I was never a very good shape-shifter. If you could see the face I'm stuck with, you'd know what I mean, but I think I can be a good teacher. You'll be better than I ever was. And I promise I'll never treat you the way I was treated.

A part of me was lost forever. But that little ball of goo back in the lab changed everything. I feel as if I'm experiencing what it is to be a changeling again.
