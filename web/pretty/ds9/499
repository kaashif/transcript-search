<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>SISKO:  According to Starfleet intelligence, Chancellor Gowron has relocated Klingon military headquarters to Ty'Gokor.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>WORF:  That will make our job more difficult. Ty'Gokor is located in an asteroid field deep in Klingon space. It is probably the most heavily fortified installation in the Empire.</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>SISKO:  There are at least thirty warships stationed there at any given time and the entire asteroid field is protected by a tachyon detection grid.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Which means there's no way we can get a cloaked ship within transporter range.</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>WORF:  Even if we do find a way inside, getting close to Gowron will not be easy. He is guarded around the clock by his personal security force, the Yan-Isleth.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>KIRA:  Look, I don't want to sound negative, but even if you do get to Gowron, how are you going to prove to the Klingons he's a changeling?</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>ODO:  I doubt he's going to stand still and let us take a blood sample.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>BASHIR:  The Klingons are obsessive about blood screenings. If he's lasted this long, the changeling impersonating Gowron must have already found a way around them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L67"><td><a href="#L67">67</a></td><td>WORF:  There is another option. We could kill him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>SISKO:  Our orders are to expose Gowron, not assassinate him. Which is why Starfleet has given us these.</td></tr>

<tr id="L71"><td><a href="#L71">71</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Very impressive. What are they?</td></tr>

<tr id="L72"><td><a href="#L72">72</a></td><td>DAX:  They're modified polaron emitters.</td></tr>

<tr id="L74"><td><a href="#L74">74</a></td><td>SISKO:  Starfleet Science thinks that exposure to polaron radiation will have a destabilising effect on changeling physiology.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>ODO:  In other words, if we use these on Gowron and he is one of my people, he won't be able to retain his humanoid shape.</td></tr>

<tr id="L76"><td><a href="#L76">76</a></td><td>SISKO:  That's the theory.</td></tr>

<tr id="L77"><td><a href="#L77">77</a></td><td>DAX:  The problem is, for it to work properly, you have to activate all four emitters at once.</td></tr>

<tr id="L78"><td><a href="#L78">78</a></td><td>SISKO:  (holding the remote) With this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L79"><td><a href="#L79">79</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  I hate prototypes.</td></tr>

<tr id="L80"><td><a href="#L80">80</a></td><td>DAX:  Plus, too much polaron radiation can be fatal. Which means we can only expose a person once. Any more than that, changeling or not, and they could die from radiation poisoning.</td></tr>

<tr id="L81"><td><a href="#L81">81</a></td><td>SISKO:  The plan is to smuggle these into Ty'Gokor. Once they're set up, they can cover about twelve thousand cubic metres.</td></tr>

<tr id="L82"><td><a href="#L82">82</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  So let me get this straight. All we have to do is get past an enemy fleet, avoid a tachyon detection grid, beam into the middle of Klingon headquarters and avoid the Brotherhood of the Sword long enough to set these things up and activate them in front of Gowron.</td></tr>

<tr id="L83"><td><a href="#L83">83</a></td><td>WORF:  If we succeed, there will be many songs sung in our honour.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  Let's hope we're there to hear them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>KIRA:  The first problem is how to get you safely to Ty'Gokor.</td></tr>
