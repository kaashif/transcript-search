<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>ODO:  Commander, there are still elements opposed to the peace treaty between Cardassia and Bajor on both sides. We have to be prepared for trouble.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>SISKO:  I realise that. But while the Cardassians are here, I want the Bajorans to get used to seeing them walking on the Promenade, buying from their shops, eating from their restaurants, getting to know them as something other than brutal overseers.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>DAX:  Oh, you're right. What's the thirty fourth?</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>QUARK:  War is good for business. It's easy to get them confused. The way I see it, it won't be long before there's a permanent Cardassian presence on the station. Scientists, diplomats, spies.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>ODO:  And they'll all be welcome at Quark's.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>QUARK:  As long as they can pay. Rumour has it that the shop next door to mine is going out of business. I'm thinking of renting it and setting up a few Cardassian gaming concessions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L35"><td><a href="#L35">35</a></td><td>QUARK:  But that's just the beginning. Soon, Quark's will become known as the best place for Cardassian food and drink in this sector. I'll probably set up daily shipments from Cardassia. I may even need to buy my own transport ship.</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>YARKA:  Not at all. I'm simply telling you what was foretold in the ancient texts.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>KIRA:  Ancient texts? You mean a prophecy?</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>YARKA:  Trakor's third, when he first encountered the Orb of Change.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>YARKA:  Perhaps you should make more time to study the texts, child.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>YARKA:  Exactly. Trakor's words are clear. When the river wakes, stirred once more to Janir's side, three vipers will return to their nest in the sky. The river has awoken, Emissary.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>KIRA:  The Qui'al dam was just put back into operation to divert water to the city.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>YARKA:  Just as Trakor prophesied over three thousand years ago. And even now, the vipers are making their way here.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>SISKO:  I take it you think the vipers are a reference to the Cardassian scientists.</td></tr>

<tr id="L57"><td><a href="#L57">57</a></td><td>SISKO:  And how exactly is their presence here going to bring destruction on us all?</td></tr>

<tr id="L58"><td><a href="#L58">58</a></td><td>YARKA:  Trakor said when the vipers try to peer through the temple gates, a sword of stars will appear in the heavens, the temple will burn and the gates will be cast open. You must not let the Cardassians come here. You must not let them violate the Celestial Temple or they will destroy it and Bajor will be cut off from the Prophets forever.</td></tr>

<tr id="L59"><td><a href="#L59">59</a></td><td>SISKO:  Slow down. Now let me get this straight. You're saying that the vipers, the Cardassians, are going to destroy the wormhole?</td></tr>

<tr id="L60"><td><a href="#L60">60</a></td><td>YARKA:  Don't you see? This communications relay you hope to create is part of the prophecy. It will allow the vipers to peer through the temple gates. The wormhole, as you call it. And if they do, the temple will be destroyed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L61"><td><a href="#L61">61</a></td><td>KIRA:  Even if we accept that the Cardassians are the vipers, there are only two of them coming, not three. Isn't it possible that there are other mistakes in your interpretation of the prophecy as well?</td></tr>

<tr id="L62"><td><a href="#L62">62</a></td><td>YARKA:  There will be three vipers. You will see.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>SISKO:  Do you understand what this communications relay could mean for Bajor? If it works, we'll be able to stay in contact with ships in the Gamma Quadrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>KIRA:  It'll facilitate exploration, help us monitor Dominion activity, give us warning in case of an attack.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>YARKA:  None of that matters. You must listen to me. I know it is difficult for you to accept because you are not Bajoran. I have studied the prophecies all my life. We are on the verge of a great disaster.</td></tr>

<tr id="L69"><td><a href="#L69">69</a></td><td>YARKA:  They have chosen to ignore the signs. That is why I came to you, Emissary. Because I have faith in you. I know that you will do what must be done.</td></tr>
