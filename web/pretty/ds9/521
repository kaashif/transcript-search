<tr id="L6"><td><a href="#L6">6</a></td><td>SISKO:  Well it should. It's puree of tube grubs.</td></tr>

<tr id="L8"><td><a href="#L8">8</a></td><td>JAKE:  Tube grubs?</td></tr>

<tr id="L9"><td><a href="#L9">9</a></td><td>SISKO:  I figured if Nog is willing to eat squid, it's only fair that we try tube grubs. Besides, you said it was terrific.</td></tr>

<tr id="L10"><td><a href="#L10">10</a></td><td>JAKE:  That was before I knew what it was.</td></tr>

<tr id="L11"><td><a href="#L11">11</a></td><td>SISKO:  Eat. You need more meat on your bones. So, tell me, Nog. How do you like working security?</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>SISKO:  Bad?</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>NOG:  They're loud, obnoxious, and if I may say so, sir, generally intoxicated. They walk around the station like they own the place, and whenever a station security officer tries to talk to them, say to ask them to keep the noise level down on the Promenade, they ignore him.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>JAKE:  You mean they ignore you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L25"><td><a href="#L25">25</a></td><td>NOG:  They never look me in the eye when I try to talk to them, sir. They just stare over my head and pretend I'm not even there. I hate it when they do that.</td></tr>

<tr id="L26"><td><a href="#L26">26</a></td><td>SISKO:  I can see how that might be annoying.</td></tr>

<tr id="L27"><td><a href="#L27">27</a></td><td>JAKE:  Not as annoying as listening to him complain about it all the time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L28"><td><a href="#L28">28</a></td><td>SISKO:  Here is what I suggest, Cadet. The next time the Klingons refuse to acknowledge your presence, do what a Klingon would do. Confront them about it. If you stand up to them, you'll earn their respect.</td></tr>

<tr id="L29"><td><a href="#L29">29</a></td><td>JAKE:  Or get your butt kicked. One or the other.</td></tr>

<tr id="L30"><td><a href="#L30">30</a></td><td>SISKO:  Either way, they'll never ignore you again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L38"><td><a href="#L38">38</a></td><td>ANNOTATION: Jake drags Nog out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L42"><td><a href="#L42">42</a></td><td>MARTOK:  I was as surprised as you. I thought the Maquis were wiped out by Cardassia and their new Dominion allies, but it would appear I was mistaken.</td></tr>

<tr id="L43"><td><a href="#L43">43</a></td><td>SISKO:  Were you able to decode it?</td></tr>

<tr id="L44"><td><a href="#L44">44</a></td><td>REBECCA [on PADD]:  Michael, I hope you get this message. We've launched the missiles. They should reach Cardassia in thirteen days. It may not bring back our dead, but at least they'll have a lot of company.</td></tr>

<tr id="L45"><td><a href="#L45">45</a></td><td>SISKO:  Did you detect any missiles?</td></tr>

<tr id="L46"><td><a href="#L46">46</a></td><td>MARTOK:  No. But that proves nothing. A few months ago, the Klingon High Council decided to aid the Maquis in their fight against Cardassia. We provided them with thirty class four cloaking devices. It was our understanding they would use them on their ships.</td></tr>

<tr id="L47"><td><a href="#L47">47</a></td><td>SISKO:  But they could have been mounted on the missiles instead.</td></tr>

<tr id="L48"><td><a href="#L48">48</a></td><td>MARTOK:  You see the problem.</td></tr>

<tr id="L49"><td><a href="#L49">49</a></td><td>SISKO:  The Maquis had access to tricobalt explosives, biogenic weapons, antimatter warheads.</td></tr>

<tr id="L50"><td><a href="#L50">50</a></td><td>MARTOK:  The death toll could be in the millions.</td></tr>

<tr id="L51"><td><a href="#L51">51</a></td><td>SISKO:  I knew the Maquis were desperate, but I didn't believe that they would resort to something like this.</td></tr>

<tr id="L52"><td><a href="#L52">52</a></td><td>MARTOK:  A sabre bear is most deadly when it is trapped with no hope of escape.</td></tr>

<tr id="L53"><td><a href="#L53">53</a></td><td>SISKO:  Cardassia is under Dominion protection. If millions of their citizens are killed by human terrorists, they'll demand revenge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L54"><td><a href="#L54">54</a></td><td>MARTOK:  And their Dominion allies will see that they get it. They'll launch a counterstrike against the Federation, the Klingon Empire, and the entire Alpha Quadrant.</td></tr>

<tr id="L55"><td><a href="#L55">55</a></td><td>SISKO:  And start a war that could destroy us all.</td></tr>

<tr id="L63"><td><a href="#L63">63</a></td><td>O'BRIEN:  The Defiant's warp engines are too powerful. They ionise the nebular gases in the Badlands.</td></tr>

<tr id="L64"><td><a href="#L64">64</a></td><td>DAX:  It's like a Ligorian mastodon moving through the forest. You may not be able to see it, but it definitely makes the leaves rustle.</td></tr>

<tr id="L65"><td><a href="#L65">65</a></td><td>SISKO:  I need answers, people. If those missiles do exist, they're only eleven days from their target. I want to know where they are and how to stop them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L66"><td><a href="#L66">66</a></td><td>WORF:  We need more information, a way to narrow our search.</td></tr>

<tr id="L75"><td><a href="#L75">75</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge.</td></tr>

<tr id="L84"><td><a href="#L84">84</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Guess again.</td></tr>

<tr id="L85"><td><a href="#L85">85</a></td><td>SISKO:  If those missiles hit Cardassia, it could start a war. Billions of people will be killed.</td></tr>

<tr id="L86"><td><a href="#L86">86</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out.</td></tr>

<tr id="L87"><td><a href="#L87">87</a></td><td>SISKO:  I heard the same reports. It was a tragedy.</td></tr>

<tr id="L88"><td><a href="#L88">88</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L89"><td><a href="#L89">89</a></td><td>SISKO:  You may have taken off the uniform, but you're still a Starfleet officer. And you don't want a war between the Federation and the Dominion any more than I do.</td></tr>

<tr id="L90"><td><a href="#L90">90</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them.</td></tr>

<tr id="L91"><td><a href="#L91">91</a></td><td>SISKO:  Maybe we can't locate the missiles, but that doesn't mean we can't stop them. You must have programmed in an abort code, some way to deactivate the missiles by remote.</td></tr>

<tr id="L92"><td><a href="#L92">92</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck.</td></tr>

<tr id="L93"><td><a href="#L93">93</a></td><td>SISKO:  That's it? You're just going to lie there and do nothing.</td></tr>

<tr id="L94"><td><a href="#L94">94</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar.</td></tr>

<tr id="L96"><td><a href="#L96">96</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important.</td></tr>

<tr id="L97"><td><a href="#L97">97</a></td><td>SISKO:  It's not about me. Do you want your freedom or not?</td></tr>

<tr id="L98"><td><a href="#L98">98</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do?</td></tr>

<tr id="L100"><td><a href="#L100">100</a></td><td>EDDINGTON:  What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it.</td></tr>
