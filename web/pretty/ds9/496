<tr id="L102"><td><a href="#L102">102</a></td><td>SISKO:  These renegade Jem'Hadar stole some equipment from my station. EPS power stabilisers, microfusion initiators, photonic amplifiers.</td></tr>

Even shutting down the wormhole won't protect the Alpha Quadrant. With the Gateway, they could put a million Jem'Hadar warriors on any Federation planet instantaneously. Would you care to see our projections of Federation casualties?</td></tr>

<tr id="L108"><td><a href="#L108">108</a></td><td>SISKO:  Couldn't the Founders just order them to surrender? From what I know, the Jem'Hadar have been genetically conditioned to obey them.</td></tr>
