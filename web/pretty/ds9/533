<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>WORF:  It is not a laughing matter. If people like them are allowed to compete freely, then parents would feel pressured to have their children enhanced so that they could keep up.</td></tr>

<tr id="L111"><td><a href="#L111">111</a></td><td>BASHIR:  Giving them a chance to contribute doesn't necessarily mean sanctioning what was done to them.
