<tr id="L7"><td><a href="#L7">7</a></td><td>MELANIE:  I'm a writer. At least, I want to be. And the truth is I was looking for you.</td></tr>

<tr id="L21"><td><a href="#L21">21</a></td><td>MELANIE:  It made me want to read everything you'd ever written, but when I looked, all I could find was your Collected Stories. I couldn't believe it. I'd finally found someone whose writing I really admired, and he'd only published two books.</td></tr>

<tr id="L22"><td><a href="#L22">22</a></td><td>JAKE SR:  Not much to show for a life's work, is it? I'm going to go get us some tea.</td></tr>

<tr id="L23"><td><a href="#L23">23</a></td><td>MELANIE:  I savoured those stories. I read them slowly, one each day, and when I was done I wished I hadn't read them at all. So I could read them again like it was the first time.</td></tr>

<tr id="L24"><td><a href="#L24">24</a></td><td>JAKE SR:  There's only one first time for everything, isn't there? And only one last time too. You think about that such things when you get to be my age. That today might be the last time you sit in your favourite chair, or watch the rain fall, or enjoy a cup of tea by a warm fire.</td></tr>

<tr id="L32"><td><a href="#L32">32</a></td><td>JAKE SR:  If you had shown up yesterday or the day before, or a week ago, I would have said no and sent you on your way. But here you are, today of all days, and somehow it seems like the right time for me to finally tell this story. It begins many years ago. I was eighteen and the worst thing that could happen to a young man happened to me. My father died. We were very close, my father and I, partly because we'd lost my mother several years earlier.</td></tr>

<tr id="L33"><td><a href="#L33">33</a></td><td>MELANIE:  I know. I read a biography about you. It said that you stopped writing so you could conduct scientific research?</td></tr>

<tr id="L34"><td><a href="#L34">34</a></td><td>JAKE SR:  It's not quite that simple. You see, just before my father died, I was working on a short story. I don't remember what it was about but I do know that I was taking it very seriously. I worked on it night and day for weeks, and I wasn't making any headway and it was making me miserable. I suppose my father saw that I needed a break.</td></tr>

I felt vaguely ridiculous, like a child insisting his parents check under his bed for monsters. She tried to tell me it was probably just a nightmare and I did my best to put the entire episode out of my mind. I puttered around the station for the next eight or nine months. Nog was off at Starfleet. My stories stubbornly refused to write themselves. I filled my time playing dom-jot and tried not to think about how alone I felt. Dax and the others were worried about me.</td></tr>

<tr id="L109"><td><a href="#L109">109</a></td><td>JAKE SR [OC]:  But before long, they had bigger things to worry about. Tensions with the Klingons were continuing to rise. My father was a kind of religious figure to the Bajoran people, and when he died they took it as a sign from the Prophets that the Federation wouldn't be able to protect them from the Klingons. Eventually Bajor entered into a mutual defence pact with the Cardassians, and the Klingons didn't like that at all. The station's civilian population was leaving en masse. They knew that if war broke out against the Klingons, Deep Space Nine was going to be on the front line.</td></tr>

Eventually, I came to understand the nature of what was happening to him. It was as if he was frozen in time at the moment of the accident, and the link between us was like an elastic cord. Every so often the cord would go taut enough to yank him forward into my time. But only for a few minutes. I realised that if my motion through time came to a stop, the cord would go slack and he'd be lost in subspace forever. But if I could cut the cord when the link was at its strongest, while we were together, he'd return to the moment of the accident.</td></tr>
