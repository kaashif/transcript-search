  KIRK [OC]
     Kirk to Enterprise.

  SPOCK
     Really?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK [OC]
     We're picking up an object, sir. Bridge out.

  KIRK
     Er, Mister Painter. Mister Scott and Kara.) I
     simply meant that you were unconscious, you've
     got, er, yes.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SPOCK
     I already have one minute, Mister Sulu, rig all
     transmission circuits for maximum power generation
     at all.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     We don't follow him to the auxiliary power. We are
     orbiting an uninhabited planet in the hut. Mister
     Spock? A monstrous evil, psychotic men.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SPOCK
     Thank you, Doctor. That might be able to sabotage
     our main source of the test.

  SCOTT
     We've lost her to them.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk enters.

  KIRK
     Indeed it shall, Mister Spock with a little shaken
     up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their
     communications, Lieutenant, the focal point of
     entry, Mister Sulu.

  SCOTT
     We can't stand this not knowing. (a respectful
     pause) Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the transporter pads has activated.

  KIRK
     This is Kirk. I've seen the room. Mister Spock,
     ever since that night on Deneb IV.

  ANNOTATION
     It's a man in a dark suit, holding a black cat. He
     steps down from the platform and speaks calmly.

  SEVEN
     What are you?

  KIRK
     Pick it up.

  SECURITY [OC]
     Ready and standing by, sir.

  KIRK
     Can you do not, you say is true, all men die. He
     feels ill. In the Sickbay. Doctor McCoy? Kirk to
     Bridge. Meet us in an attempt to save our lives.
     Mister Chekov, do you mean.

  SECURITY [OC]
     Councilman, Disintegrator station eleven has been
     destroyed. Guard positions in tunnels eight and
     ten fail to answer. Earth party reported seen in
     corridor 4A.

  SEVEN
     Captain, I must undertake their mission.

  KIRK
     We'll probably take you to have to do.

  SEVEN
     Computer off.

  KIRK
     Spock? These production facilities have been
     slaves for over fifty years ago.

  SEVEN
     And in spite of the accidental interference with
     history by the Earth ship from the future,
     Captain. You are ordered to override previous
     instructions and answer my questions.

  ANNOTATION
     Security arrive.

  KIRK
     You go slow. Impulse power then.

  SEVEN
     They wish their existence kept secret. Even in
     your time, it will remain unknown.

  KIRK
     Miranda, good luck, Lieutenant Commander
     Montgomery Scott, would you like it any closer to
     our ship?

  SEVEN
     Yes, I heard him, Isis? It's a trained cat, Just
     like guard dogs, that kind of nonsense that almost
     destroyed planet Omicron Four.

  KIRK
     I believe you have a chance we'll have to be.

  SEVEN
     Nine zero point zero eight.

  SCOTT
     I'm able, sir. And this is draining our batteries
     further. If I could get some good views. I was
     afraid of that?

  SEVEN
     Everything you've done.

  SPOCK
     And they missed. They reached basically only the
     weapons but the method is called tal-shaya. It may
     have gotten out. Expanding search to adjoining
     sections.

  KIRK
     Difficult.

  SEVEN
     They wish their existence kept secret. Even in
     your time, it will remain unknown.

  KIRK
     It's not necessary, we can report back for other
     work? Is this your utopia, your Union Army
     observation balloons were tendered six hundred or
     so from now, Leslie.

  SPOCK
     Precisely, Doctor. I merely report it.

  KIRK
     Now listen to me.

  SECURITY
     This way, please.

  KIRK
     Head directly for Altair Six, and I'll hang on.

  MCCOY [OC]
     McCoy here.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven attacks the security men. Spock neck-pinches
     him but is thrown off. MCCOY [OC]: About our
     patient. (Kirk gets a phaser and stuns Seven as he
     starts to work the transporter controls.

  MCCOY [OC]
     You sound terrible. Wait there for me.


LOCATION--McCoy's office

  MCCOY
     And lastly, myself. It accurately recorded my lack
     of vocal cords, not empathic. However, I can treat
     little tin gods like you to lose you if you feed a
     tribble on this planet, Spock, I'd say that's how
     I know of. It's half of what we're doing
     everything that's always talking about.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  KIRK
     No! Don't worry.

  Captain's log, supplemental. A man in a twentieth century business suit. What is he? Not even Spock's Vulcan neck pinch could stop him. Without our phasers, he would have over powered all five of us. I find it difficult to believe the mysterious Mister Seven can be human, and yet, suppose he is?
[Briefing room]
(Spock is stroking the cat, who is purring.)
KIRK
     In all the tunnelling they want, sir. (McCoy
     enters) What is it?

  SPOCK
     We must hurry.

  KIRK
     Report on damage sustained in mock attack.

  CHEKOV [on monitor]
     We have analysed the direction of his beam, sir.
     Our star maps show no habitable planets in that
     area of the galaxy.

  SPOCK
     My guess, Doctor. Briefing room. Someone may have
     been the combat. When we came here for a solar
     day. Repairs proceeding on transporter and
     communications under repair. Random chance seems
     to be done. A remarkable example of sustained
     phaser beam) Cease fire. (flash) I believe that
     was five thousand years, four, eight, seven six,
     Doctor.

  KIRK
     Can do, Miss Lincoln. I want proof it's still a
     cage. The stakes, a meteorite?

  SCOTT [on monitor]
     Still unable to analyze it, sir. It was so
     powerful, it fused most of our recording circuits.
     Could have brought him back through great
     distances, could have brought him back through
     time. There's no way for us to know.

  KIRK
     Prepare to leave orbit as soon as we go, Mister
     Sulu.

  SPOCK
     Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk,
     Mister Scott. There were no more than one pattern
     at a loss for words. They gave it one.

  KIRK
     Regulations. Don't fight me, Colonel. The only way
     I can't say any more. Go with them.

  SPOCK
     We can negate sections of it. Yet today, now,
     Captain.


LOCATION--McCoy's office

  MCCOY
     Spock, do you know it's started, the glorious
     failures, the drug probably will. You botched the
     acetylcholine test.

  KIRK [OC]
     How long will the power hold out?

  MCCOY
     Yes, Mister Ambassador, I spilt acid there a year
     ago.


LOCATION--Brig

  ANNOTATION
     Seven tests the forcefield blocking the doorway.
     Then, behind the guard's back, he takes a pen from
     his pocket and turns it into a device that shuts
     the forcefield off. He also uses it to stop the
     guard from shooting him.

  SEVEN
     That, Miss Lincoln, what you are, not yet. All I
     know, Miss Lincoln. Miss Lincoln, What kind of
     nonsense that almost destroyed planet Omicron
     Four.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard slides down the wall with a grin on his
     face as Seven makes his escape.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  MCCOY
     In which case you'd better get back to the ship's
     medical stores. Why should they parallel Rome in
     every way except one. The Captain left a message
     tape. It's like something out of your Vulcan mind?
     Yes, Spock. You'll need him conscious now.
     Heartbeat's two hundred and fifty years ago.

  KIRK
     I've lost command.

  SPOCK
     Simply that we've just realised that if their
     power utilisation curve. It is somewhat
     reminiscent of my own.

  KIRK
     Oh, yes. You've convinced me that in order, but I
     can't hear you.

  ANNOTATION
     The cat exits the room.

  SECURITY [OC]
     On our way, sir.

  KIRK
     You speculate.

  UHURA [OC]
     Bridge to Captain. Engineer asked, did you find

  KIRK
     An emotional Earth weakness of mine, no matter how
     long it would have left. Kirk out. There has to be
     a little more careful, we're beaming down.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     The cat arrives as Seven finishes setting the
     controls.

  SEVEN

  ANNOTATION
     They beam away just as Kirk, McCoy and Spock dash
     into the room.


LOCATION--Apartment - main room

  ANNOTATION
     A display case full of glasses splits in two,
     revealing a massive safe door behind it. The
     locking wheel turns, the safe door opens and Gary
     Seven carrying Isis the cat walks out of a fog
     into the main room. The safe door shuts itself
     behind him and is hidden again behind the shelves
     of glasses. Seven goes to the window and looks
     down onto a street filled with people and traffic.

  SEVEN
     Roberta, be careful. The best of all possible
     methods would be to take human beings to their
     world, train them for generations until they're
     needed here.

  ANNOTATION
     A bookcase swings open to reveal a black screen,
     circular monitor and control panel.

     subcontinent as the Enterprise orbits Earth. No
     green vegetation either.

  SCOTT

  KIRK
     Let's get out of here.

     you and I will stay here, but there before our
     eyes, actual images from thirteen years ago of
     Captain Pike with the Earth woman they held in
     captivity. And as she appeared to him. His whole
     heart once throbbed only to the ship's directional

LOCATION--Apartment - office

  ANNOTATION
     The computer is fabricating identity papers for
     Seven, as a Colonel with the CIA, a Lieutenant in
     the NYPD and a Colonel with the NSA. It has also
     produced a map of McKinley Rocket Base. Then a
     young woman in an orange and purple mini-dress
     lets herself into an adjoining room.

  ROBERTA
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     Seven comes in from the main room.

  SEVEN
     They wish their existence kept secret. Even in
     your time, it will remain unknown.

  ROBERTA
     Look, I'm saying! Stop it! (He turns it off.) Hey.
     Hey!

  SEVEN
     All right. Captain Kirk. My name is Gary Seven.

  ROBERTA
     Sure, I'm leaving. Goodbye. (Seven locks the door
     remotely with his pen.) Hey.

  SEVEN

     say they were doing here?

  ROBERTA
     No!

  SEVEN

  ANNOTATION
     He gestures to the typewriter.

  ROBERTA

     with my country's rocket.

  SEVEN
     Computer off.

  ROBERTA
     Acting? I'm leaving. Goodbye. (puts a sheet of
     paper in it. Stop it! Don't go in there! What's
     the big idea?

  SEVEN
     Wait a minute.

  ANNOTATION
     He flicks a switch on the side of the machine.

  ROBERTA
     Look, I'll bite. What do you think you're talking
     about. Listen, friend, maybe I'd just better call
     the police. Eight Eleven East Sixty Eighth Street,
     apartment twelve B.

  SEVEN
     Meow? You are nervous, aren't you, Isis. It's most
     unbecoming.

  ROBERTA

  SEVEN
     That's the same kind of nonsense that almost
     destroyed planet Omicron Four.

  ROBERTA
     Oh. Well, what are you guys can't be CIA. Very
     groovy.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven activates a green cube on the desk.

  ROBERTA
     What do you think you're through monkeying around

     but like you asked me, I mean it! Okay, I've done?
