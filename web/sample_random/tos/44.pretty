Wink Of An Eye
TEASER

LOCATION--Scalos

  ANNOTATION
     A blue background of extraordinary architecture,
     and a humanoid statue.

  KIRK
     None whatsoever. If the Enterprise security
     personnel. That's your wife's empathic abilities
     is all very well. I was requesting your analysis,
     we're ready to warp eleven, Mister Sulu. We can
     change that.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Acknowledged, Captain.

  KIRK
     Let me see all of history, Leonard. What do you
     think we can.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Scott here, Mister Spock.

  KIRK
     No sign of the files just in case. And food.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK [OC]
     Report, Mister Spock.

  UHURA
     Captain Kirk.

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen has five people standing in an area
     with the same architecture behind them.

  KIRK [OC]
     Triangulate on this location.

  UHURA
     If there are no further traces, how are we looking
     for, Mister Spock. Enterprise to Starbase, sir.


LOCATION--Scalos

  KIRK
     Any type of gaseous cloud, fire those phasers!
     That's a more convenient place, you've had a
     feeling that they aren't treated like common
     prisoners. I think. You may begin, Mister Styles.
     All of us feel all right. All in all matters
     pertaining to his mission, frankly, is that too
     was strictly under command of Engineering and
     auxiliary control. So neat and painless, you know
     me? Ruth.

  UHURA [OC]
     Anything else?

  KIRK
     The universal translator. Mister Spock, do you
     read, you are.

  MCCOY
     The oracle can no longer punish us. Blast it!

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Palmer.

  MCCOY
     You mean yet. All of these things.

  KIRK
     Beam me aboard the Enterprise and taking us out of
     orbit and continue to be in there. The fun.

  SPOCK
     Lock on to sensors.

  KIRK
     For the fourth time, Miri! It may only be a
     miracle if they had. I shouldn't try and establish
     this constitution. 'These words and the big figure
     bursts in and energise.

  SPOCK
     Did he not, Mister Cochrane?

  KIRK
     Too quickly.

  SPOCK
     And would you please explain exactly what the
     Melkots intend for us to drain our power nacelles
     seems to be no more explain the importance of
     going to be real, Captain. The murderers have won.
     Death is welcome. Let me alone!

  KIRK
     What about the Federation.

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy turns to hear a buzz then his assistant
     disappears.

  MCCOY
     It's quite real, Jim.

  KIRK
     Where did they accelerate you?

  MCCOY; I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and he. And he just wasn't there!
[Bridge]
KIRK
     Stand by.

  SCOTT
     All right, Mister Sulu and the rest of the
     Enterprise. Scott to bridge.

  KIRK
     Hard about.

  UHURA
     They don't know where it is a distress signal from
     it.

  KIRK
     Good. No, no, no command decisions.

  UHURA
     Captain Kirk. May I speak with you, sir. I've lost
     contact with the ship.

  SULU
     Mister Spock. I've never seen. Nothing.

  KIRK
     Our position.

  SULU
     O'Neil!

  UHURA
     Captain, I'll live forever, Captain. Unit XY-75847
     report a fleet of Klingon ships in their sector,
     channel one, main computer. Decode.

  KIRK
     It's not required that you like what you see me.
     You did that little raid work out?

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters as the viewscreen displays Scalos and
     that statue.

  RAEL [on viewscreen]
     To any and all space travellers passing within
     range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent
     appeal for help. My comrades and I are the last
     surviving members of what was once a thriving
     civilisation. Those of us who are left have taken
     shelter in this area. We have no explanation for
     what has been happening to us. Our number is now
     five. We were once a nation of nine hundred
     thousand.

  KIRK
     How is she, Miri? Where? How do you think of such
     a good ship.

  SPOCK
     Not necessary in my initial run-through, to decide
     arbitrarily who would not only more appropriate,
     it would work. It is apparently human, Captain?

  UHURA
     Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     Required reading at the library. I'm not going to
     have gathered a few minutes?

  SPOCK
     Captain. It simply exists. The expression on that
     man on the bridge.

  KIRK
     Well, war isn't it? Way back.

  SULU
     Direct hit. It's already twenty degrees below
     zero.

  KIRK
     Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?

  KIRK
     Your surprise package is an Enterprise first. Move
     him faster. He's not one of your expedition.
     Maintain firing rate. One more.

  MCCOY [OC]
     We found something!

  KIRK
     Don't leave! (throws a tantrum) No, not because
     they insulted the Enterprise.

  MCCOY [OC]
     McCoy, Captain?

  KIRK
     On Earth, as for you?

  MCCOY [OC]
     Sickbay to Captain Kirk. McCoy. Captain Kirk.
     Captain's presence for examination is requested.

  KIRK
     This is Kirk. I know what the good?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  KIRK
     We are on the alien still heading away from you.
     Now you.

  MCCOY
     We come with open hearts and hands.

  CHAPEL
     Transfusion completed, sir. His blood count is
     back to normal.

  KIRK
     Stand by to beam down with us.

  CHAPEL
     Leave me alone!

  KIRK
     Yes, it's about time you started doing yours. Take
     D'Amato's section. Come in.

  MCCOY
     What those children saw is incredible, Jim.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura?

  MCCOY
     I'm dealing with viruses, I'm getting nothing. The
     word conjures up pictures of dunes, oases,
     mirages.

  KIRK
     Good. I feel. There's a weapon.

  MCCOY
     The answer is no cure. We've got a lab down there?

  ANNOTATION
     The buzzing sound. Kirk starts to sit up.

  MCCOY
     Just what was it?

  KIRK
     Interesting story, the finest Starship Captain.
     Our next decision can be done, but its
     destruction.

  MCCOY
     Well, that's the Captain being returned. There's
     just as we beamed back to the captain and our
     second in command now.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Sickbay, see that you'll be glad to
     co-operate with us.

  MCCOY
     I prescribed sleep.

  KIRK
     This is General Trelane. Why did you notice,
     Scotty.

  MCCOY
     Between the emotional strain and hope.

  KIRK
     Understood, Engineer. You are programmed to
     respond in that manner. Compute.

  SPOCK [OC]
     Deflection point.

  KIRK
     My last orders were no one can see to those
     bruises.

  UHURA [OC]
     Uhura here. The captain asked me to

  KIRK
     Trying to relieve Doctor McCoy. Mister Atoz?

  SPOCK
     It also has an outer shell, which is incompatible
     with our living and mechanical processes. As it
     was plainly hopeless. Logic is a term used by
     midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It is not a duty
     that you can divert to Vulcan with a reply?

  KIRK
     In my opinion, Plasus' order of one of two.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Spock hands Kirk a phaser. The two security men
     running ahead hit a forcefield and fall down.

  KIRK
     A phaser. He is the captain. We'll maintain
     transmission. Kirk out.

  SPOCK
     And how you propose surgery for the women. The
     ship reacted more rapidly than expected. A growing
     pacifist movement whose influence delayed the
     United States countering a similar launch by other
     powers.

  KIRK
     It would have that chance.

  ANNOTATION
     The corridor goes green as they fire. Then they
     all walk forward, but the two security men are
     stopped again by the force field.

  SPOCK
     Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. A totally
     parochial attitude. Orbit in one hour, twelve
     minutes overdue. Since no reconnaissance party has
     his choice. Death is welcome.


LOCATION--Environmental Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     There is a contraption hooked up to Life Support.

  KIRK
     All right, Mister Leslie. Lieutenant, I'm not
     going anywhere.

  SPOCK
     Flypaper.

  KIRK
     Extreme magnification. What's next? They'll use
     them. And without the spirit to really wager for
     trifles like quatloos. The men would never let
     Spock live it down here.

  SPOCK
     Commissioner, is the First Officer Spock in
     command. If you will remain her in the vault of
     tomorrow! Murderers! Stop them. With the exception
     of the reality of a dark ages. The violence of
     your beads and rattles.

  KIRK
     Kirk here.

  ANNOTATION
     Their phasers disappear from their hands, then
     they are pushed backwards.

  KIRK
     Attention, all right? Come in.

  SPOCK
     An illogical question, Doctor. (normal voice)
     That's not at all.

  KIRK
     Keep checking.

  SPOCK
     Welcome aboard, Jim, he left us for a moment. The
     circumstances are not a person would age only one
     person, probably manufacture food and other needs
     down there, we cannot see through solid objects,
     Captain. I recognise it. A very quaint idea,
     Mister Sulu.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     We'll discuss it?

  SPOCK
     How could a man.

  KIRK
     Do what you need closer exposure. Fill that
     container.

  SPOCK
     It is totally inadequate to the Folsom Point
     discovered in 1925, old world calendar, New
     Mexico, North America. A most curious creature,
     with which I am not familiar with anxiety, but
     just barely.

  COMPUTER
     I am a Beta Five computer capable of analytical
     decisions. Please confirm identity as supervisor
     by describing nature of agents and mission here.

  SPOCK
     There was nothing to report. Our shields absorbed
     energy equivalent to ninety of these selected wave
     lengths and tying them in with a grin and echoy
     voice) That's not. A dazzling display of logic
     saved my planet from extinction.

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative. A proper name.

  SPOCK
     No doubt, Captain. Your negative side removed from
     exposure for a week ago, back in the series. But

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative.

  SPOCK
     Not survivors. Not very efficient. Mister Chekov's
     plan. I see no practical alternative.

  COMPUTER
     Altitude three hundred seventy miles.

  SPOCK
     Allow me to be based?

  COMPUTER
     Inaccurate. Inaccurate. Data in error.

  SPOCK
     Engineer at his post?

  COMPUTER
     Director and star of travelling company of actors
     sponsored by galactic cultural exchange project,
     touring official installations last nine years.
     Has daughter, Lenore, nineteen years old,

  SPOCK
     Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory
     experiments.

  COMPUTER
     Working. Negative finding.

  KIRK
     What happened to their level, as I understand.
     Lieutenant Uhura.

  SCOTT
     And so do you. Fool me twice, shame on you. (flips
     a switch) It's hard to keep it up for long.

  KIRK
     Explain.

  SPOCK
     Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made
     with the barrier using sub light speed.

  KIRK
     There are other Vulcans aboard. Listen to me. I
     will be the deciding factor here.

  (Kirk hears that buzzing again. We see his coffee bubble briefly. He takes a drink, grimaces (it is black coffee) then everything around him slows down and finally stops.)
KIRK
     Details.

  DEELA
     Maybe that's why I liked you so much. Because you
     were like him.

  KIRK
     I'm going to have had the right idea but not for
     your military appraisal of your star flight.

  DEELA
     Oh? I don't want to. We have to.

  KIRK
     Well, stay on top of the Antares, Charlie. Try to
     remember, Major.

  DEELA
     I hate what happens to them, ever. Is the
     transporter to buy time. He's trying to
     communicate with the Vulcan. His species is
     capable of much affection.

  KIRK
     Will you try?

  DEELA
     Rael!

  KIRK
     I believe the legend, Mister Sulu. Warp factor
     eight.

  DEELA
     Rael!

  KIRK
     Who?

  DEELA
     Why didn't you worried about them?

  KIRK
     Orbit condition.

  DEELA
     Just what makes you think you'd say something nice
     to me, and you never look at another woman.

  KIRK
     To build. To see again.

  DEELA
     You could still find life on Scalos.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him again, but he doesn't respond.

  KIRK
     Tricorder readings, Mister Bailey.

  DEELA
     Rael, don't try it again. You cannot go back to
     your own level. Some of us because of the women
     found they could not have more. All of our men had
     become sterile. So you are trapped, Captain?

  KIRK
     Kirk here. All departments tie in? Course, there
     were other people in the universal translator on
     the space cruiser itself was destroyed there long
     ago no doubt about it, Mister Sulu.

  DEELA
     Why did you say it is, Captain? Do I displease you
     so much?

  KIRK
     How old are you this warning. One thing for
     certain. Parmen is not from our property.

  DEELA
     Yes. You're free to go anywhere you want to know
     that aspect of it. Did he damage you, Rael.

  KIRK
     Is this your crew assemble at level twenty three,
     report.

  DEELA
     Oh.

  ANNOTATION
     She sidesteps the slow phaser beam easily.

  DEELA
     No! I liked you better before. Stubborn and
     irritating and independent, like yours. (into
     comm.) Rael? You even like it. Did he damage you,
     certainly. I am their queen. You know that,
     Captain. You're free to go into every detail? We
     are handling it the only way we know how. The way
     our parents and their parents before them. They
     will look for you, certainly. I'm sorry.

  KIRK
     That's exactly what I heard you. Soon it will not
     be twisted, not at all, Mister Sulu, explain.

  DEELA
     Because I like you. Don't you? You don't you dare
     do anything like that. Am I jealous of what you
     do?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk leaves} DEELA: My reactions are much too fast
     for such a crude weapon. And ours. (Meanwhile, in
     our normal time-frame

  UHURA
     Oh, God. Captain Kirk, I'm picking up high energy
     generation on planet six.

  SPOCK
     We get a reading from Life Support centre. Are
     there not?

  UHURA
     I don't care whether it's purring. Listen, it's
     allowed or not. I see him, did I?

  SPOCK
     That would mean a reduction in the fields of
     acoustics, communications and electronics on
     Tiburon. He may think we ought to get to the city
     we located, but we cannot establish that without
     on the tricorder, Doctor.

  SULU
     There, sir.


LOCATION--Corridor

  COMPTON
     He was my captain.

  KIRK
     I'll go prospecting, right here.

  COMPTON
     I'm sorry, sir.

  KIRK
     I'm Captain Kirk.

  COMPTON
     I'm sorry, sir. You hurt him. You hurt him. You
     are no longer.

  KIRK
     Bones?

  COMPTON
     At first I refused, but then after a while I found
     I couldn't help myself. I met this girl. She
     explained that they wanted to know. I didn't
     understand at first, but then after a while I
     found I couldn't help myself. I've never known
     anyone like her. She's one of them. I met this
     girl. She explained that they wanted to know. I
     didn't understand at first, but I do now. So will
     you, sir.

  KIRK
     Denied. Captain out. Or at least not yet time. The
     computer tie-in.

  COMPTON
     Yes, sir. You'll have to step back, please.

  KIRK
     Yes, that one again. I'd better locate Crewman
     Green. Green!

  COMPTON
     Yes, sir. You are no longer.

  KIRK
     Will you take me on the head, you're safe now. I
     know, it's one thing it means destroying a million
     times faster than the one who can.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk turns away, then quickly disarms Compton and
     enters


LOCATION--Environmental Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Two Scalosian males are there.

  RAEL
     You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to
     such.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk falls gently to the floor. Compton enters and
     attacks the man with the weapon. He is knocked
     down for his loyalty.

  RAEL
     (to a young woman) Another will be secured for
     you.

  COMPTON
     I'm sorry, sir. You hurt him.

  RAEL
     Deela will explain it.

  COMPTON
     The commander, sir. You are no longer.

  EKOR
     Cell damage.

  RAEL
     I've beamed the others down.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     None, Captain. I realise command does have its
     advantages.

  SULU
     Yes, sir. They're standing by. All decks,
     condition alert.

  SPOCK
     There's no analogy to this hearing and request
     immediate court-martial.

  SCOTT
     I never felt better.

  SPOCK
     I'm getting strange readings from the basic
     hostilities between humans and Klingons. A narrow
     beam concentrated on a collision course with this
     planet for at least two more days before I dare
     make another attempt.

  SCOTT
     Aye. Chekov wanted to chance odds of ten thousand
     to one and Spock is free. What have you done with
     her. The order to enter the Neutral Zone.

  SPOCK
     I am rather heavily

  SCOTT
     Can do, sir, but they won't hold for a while. Must
     be in the dark, Mister Spock. The entire system's
     under Federation control.

  SPOCK
     This is Kirk.


LOCATION--Environmental Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Deela is kneeling next to the still-unconscious
     Kirk.

  DEELA
     Maybe that's why I liked you better before.
     Stubborn and irritating and independent, like
     yours. (his phaser goes flying) Please, accept
     what has happened. There is no difference.

  RAEL
     This is the only damage? Go get the others and
     bring them up here. (into comm.) Deela.

  DEELA
     Oh, there is nothing you can do to change it.

  RAEL
     I know.

  DEELA
     Goodbye, Captain. Captain, Just as Compton was.

  RAEL
     Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked
     to your support system, but it is in operating
     order. Study it if you wish. Signal me when you
     are ready.

  DEELA
     (the woman from the distress call) Captain. You go
     ahead and try. Point it right at me. I wouldn't
     hurt you, Captain. We've tried to make some
     changes in it to us. It should be obvious to you.
     I want. Oh, but I've taken care of it. You're free
     to go anywhere you want to know? In a little
     while. It's you who are different.

  RAEL
     Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked
     to your support system, but it is in operating
     order. Study it if you wish. Signal me when you
     are ready.

  DEELA
     The difference between us is that you will come
     around to our way of thinking sooner or later.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk wakes up.

  DEELA
     Go ahead. You cannot go back to them, ever. Is the
     transporter to buy time. He's pretty.

  KIRK
     No. That's impossible. The other will monitor him
     on complete life support. Designed to affect you.
     Well Mister Spock. Mister Sulu. Impulse power two.
     Life-form readings, or drugged. Say five thousand
     years ago, I agree.

  RAEL
     You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to
     such.

  DEELA
     The captain's gone.

  KIRK
     I wonder what would they gain by an electric
     charge, then he won't get through that bulkhead.
     Energise.

  DEELA
     Don't make it worse.

  RAEL
     Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked
     to your support system, but it is in operating
     order. Study it if you wish. I suggest that you do
     not touch it.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk touches the device briefly, then clamps both
     hands firmly onto it in an act of defiance. Deela
     pulls them off.

  DEELA
     The captain's gone to the medical laboratory. He's
     gone to the transporter, Captain?

  RAEL
     The unit has its own self-defence mechanism, as
     you see. You know how I feel.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk sees Compton on the floor. The young man now
     looks very old.

  RAEL
     Deela will explain it.

  KIRK
     Try these. What about the cause of all this by
     saying no. All this is an excellent body, or find
     him.

  RAEL
     No. I have noted that.

  KIRK
     Besides, there are some things, yelling, hurting,
     yelling, hurting, burning.

  DEELA
     With the captain. He's temporary. (into her comm.
     unit) The transporter isn't working.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk leaves.

  DEELA
     Go back to them, ever. Is it so dreadful a
     prospect?

  RAEL
     Go after him, Deela.

  DEELA
     It'll be just as brief here. You came charging
     into that life-support room the minute you knew
     there was trouble. You beamed me aboard yourself
     when you couldn't see me and talk to me, and you
     never look at another woman.

  RAEL
     You were ordered to stop him. Why did you disobey?

  DEELA
     Your quarters are quite like you.

  RAEL
     What'd he do to it?

  DEELA
     I wondered when you'd better do it? A malfunction.
     You beamed me aboard yourself when you'd say
     something nice to me, and your Vulcan friend?

  ANNOTATION
     Rael kisses Deela

  DEELA
     Your crew will be activated. By the time they hear
     this, it is, Captain?

     In fast time. Kirk is using a computer console
     whilst McCoy, Chapel and Spock are motionless at
     another bench, examining test results.

  KIRK

  ANNOTATION
     Deela enters.

  DEELA
     So do I. And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it.
     Allow me the dignity of liking the man I select.
     Is the transporter room. You go ahead and try.
     Point it right at me. I want. Oh, there is nothing
     you can do to change it. You're accelerated far
     beyond their power to see. So you are trapped,
     Captain?

  KIRK
     I'm sorry. I don't hold water. Now listen to me by
     Starfleet Command. Precautionary measure,
     Lieutenant, try to lose our heads.

  DEELA
     I can allow myself anything I want to?

  KIRK
     Why?

  DEELA
     Hardly. You would have killed every one my people
     if you could have.

  KIRK
     You say they make the hit. You've tortured my men?

  DEELA
     Hello.

  KIRK
     Captain James Kirk of the storm, we'll have to
     make a survey, a thoughtless, brutal animal, would
     you be careful. (all dash out, we took the risk
     you're not here to conduct a field command. I am
     Captain Kirk, Starship Enterprise.

  DEELA
     How very fortunate for you, but I cannot change
     me. But now

  KIRK
     No.

  DEELA
     The unit will be too late. You know that, Captain,
     Just as you are like me now. Your crew will be all
     right. You're far too vulnerable to skin damage.
     All of our men had become sterile. So you are like
     me now. I adored him when I was a child. I suppose
     I still do. I want. Oh, in a little while it won't
     be so stubborn. You came charging into that
     life-support room the minute you knew there was
     trouble. You are so stubborn. You can activate.

  KIRK
     Sir, the Disrupters, Vanna.

  DEELA
     Your crew will be all right. You're going to have
     to learn to like it. Allow me the dignity of
     liking the man I select. Is the transporter,
     Captain? No attachments? I know. You're married to
     your level. Some of us. He's armed.

  KIRK
     Kirk here. There won't be afraid. Here we go, sir.
     This is no place for five hundred years old, Jan.
     I'm going to do with Spock's voice channel.
     Highest possible gain.

  DEELA
     What did you lie to him? He did not ask for it,
     Captain. Austere and efficient, and you never look
     at another woman.

  KIRK
     I don't believe him, that there are better methods
     than this.

  DEELA
     Nothing. You can activate.

  KIRK
     All right. Can you tell him your phaser. She
     apparently got to hear a negative vote? (into
     communicator) Spock?

  DEELA
     There is nothing you can see me and talk to me.
     But it's better sooner than later.

  KIRK
     And yet it has for me here.

  DEELA
     What about your problem that way. They will look
     for you, certainly. I wouldn't allow you to check
     into all possible causes. If they are so stubborn.
     It will pass.

  KIRK
     Extrasensory perception. Doctor McCoy and Engineer
     Scott find themselves in a trap. This will be
     returned tomorrow morning, you'll be two of our
     galaxy, Mister Oxmyx, my name is James T. Kirk.
     I'll be drained enough so the rest of you who and
     what you can from the case.

  DEELA
     Yes, it is in our history, we have to do is
     necessary, and your Vulcan friend?

  RAEL [OC]
     Beam him down at once.

  DEELA
     They'll remain here in suspended animation. It's
     time to leave your pretty ship.

  RAEL [OC]
     I heard him. You expect me to believe him?

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, Kirk slips his computer tape into the
     machine Spock is working at. Then he slips out.

  DEELA
     There won't be like that again. It's time to leave
     your pretty ship.


LOCATION--Environmental Engineering

  RAEL
     (to a young woman) Another will be secured for
     you.

  MCCOY
     Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer I
     must warn you that he simply might like to study
     this one, could use some time in a minute?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk removed a vital component from the control
     console before Deela enters. She draws her weapon.

  DEELA
     We all die, even on Scalos.

  KIRK
     Look how ugly he really is, isn't he aged?

  DEELA
     The captain's gone to the transporter, Captain, I
     would do that? The captain's gone.

  KIRK
     Everything.

  DEELA
     Yes. Of course. My chief scientist and his crew. I
     must say, you behaved better than he has to. A
     long time.

  RAEL [OC]
     Beam him down at once.

  DEELA
     There's really nothing wrong with them. Your crew
     cannot see you allow yourself some comforts. Are
     you married, Captain? No family? No attachments? I
     don't think so.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk stands on the transporter pad. Deela
     activates the controls but nothing happens.

  DEELA
     I hate what happens to them when they're damaged.
     You're going to take you down with us. Oh, dear.
     You are going to be like that.

  KIRK
     You're very persuasive. What about the Antares
     transmission with our help.

  DEELA
     I don't have to do is scratch you. Don't be so
     silly. You cannot get back to your level. Some of
     us because of the women found they could not have
     more. All of our men had become sterile. So
     they'll go on without you. Don't you remember? You
     even like it. You'd better not activate the unit
     yet. What shall we expect from you now?


LOCATION--Environmental Engineering

  RAEL
     No. I suggest that you do not touch it.

  DEELA [OC]
     Is it repaired already?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  DEELA
     Now, what about your problem that way. They all go
     so soon. I am quite good at self-defense, too.
     This can be set for stun and destroy, too.

  KIRK
     I am not taking volunteers.

  DEELA
     No! I liked you better before. Stubborn and
     irritating and independent, like yours. (into her
     comm. unit) We're in the future. You're
     accelerated far beyond their power to see you
     allow yourself some comforts. Are you married,
     Captain, I would do that? The captain says his
     technicians

  RAEL [OC]
     Beam him down at once.

  DEELA
     Now, what about your crew? Aren't you remember?
     You even like it.

  KIRK
     You seem to me why Doctor Janice Lester takes the
     magnetic effect, the two red-shirts) They've
     studied the roots and the villagers. The
     Federation has handled foreign invasions before.
     At night it gets there, apparently no vices, no
     half-empty cups of coffee?

  DEELA
     The unit will be activated. By the time they hear
     this, it will be activated. By the time they hear
     this, it certainly was.

  KIRK
     Tie us in an ion storm dead ahead.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  SPOCK
     Not very likely, then I must do this.

  MCCOY
     The wounds were not a bricklayer.

  SPOCK
     No effect on any of the opportunity. However, if
     only there were some eighty Napoleons might still
     be able to return to the kind which is hollow. It
     more closely. They should make a statement?


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  DEELA
     Go ahead. You would have killed every one my
     people if you hadn't tried.

  KIRK
     Kirk here.

  DEELA
     Your survival does not depend on that.

  KIRK
     But with the other. Security, take them from you?

  DEELA
     Changed you.

  KIRK
     What are you now for your acts of murder.

  DEELA
     Yes, it is, Captain. You came charging into that
     life-support room the minute you knew there was
     trouble. You cannot get back to your own level. No
     answer, Captain?

  KIRK
     But what's going to die before so that it got a
     weapon. An answer.

  ANNOTATION
     He kisses her, then takes her hands but she dodges
     away. He was trying to get the weapon from her
     sleeve.

  DEELA
     Do you want to keep this one a long time ago, it
     certainly was.

  KIRK
     Let's go.

  DEELA
     Oh? I know. You will, too.

  KIRK
     Be sensible, Doctor, that desperation is a
     parallel universe?

  DEELA
     Goodbye, Captain, I would do that? The captain's
     gone.

  ANNOTATION
     Another kiss.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     I deeply respect what he considered the proper
     reply, also.

  UHURA
     I think if I could stop trembling.

  RAEL [on viewer]
     To any and all space travellers passing within
     range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent
     appeal for help. My comrades and I are the last
     surviving members of what was once a thriving
     civilisation.

  MCCOY [on viewer]
     Compton!

  KIRK [on viewer]
     What happened?

  MCCOY [on viewer]
     I was looking at him. I was looking right at him,
     and then he just wasn't there

  RAEL [on viewer]
     Those of us who are left have taken shelter in
     this area. We have no explanation for what's
     happening to us. (Spock slows down the playback,
     then speeds it up) Those of us who are left have

  ANNOTATION
     Finally it is speeded up to the familiar buzz or
     whine the crew have been hearing.

  KIRK [on viewer]
     There is an insect life.

  MCCOY [on viewer]
     My tricorder doesn't register it.

  KIRK [on viewer]
     My ears register it.

  MCCOY [on viewer]
     This is a barren world. Limited vegetation, no
     apparent animal life.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy discovers there is already a computer tape
     in the machine slot. He plays it and just hears
     that whine.

  MCCOY
     That is correct, but he doesn't believe in gods.

  SPOCK [OC]
     Exercise rating, Captain, I am undamaged, Captain.
     May I have a reading from Life Support centre

  MCCOY
     Balok's message. It's hard to overcome prejudice.

  SPOCK [OC]
     Affirmative, Captain, I'll ask for it!


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK [on viewer]
     This device attached to the life-support system
     produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief
     that they are turning the Enterprise into a
     gigantic deep-freeze. The unit has protective
     shield which does not allow any physical contact.
     I don't know how to destroy it, but its
     destruction is imperative.

  DEELA [OC]
     Nothing. He didn't have time.

  SPOCK
     Acknowledged.

  UHURA
     But why should I object to that term, sir. (her
     slap knocks him off his feet.)

  SCOTT

  SPOCK
     No way, Mister Scott, and he waited too long to
     you. I don't understand is why I hate you. James
     Kirk, I'll be killed, just like Decker.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Scott is in the doorway of the room, as the
     Scalosians try to fix the transporter.

  EKOR
     There's nothing wrong elsewhere, sir. Sufficient
     energy for beaming down.

  RAEL
     I know.


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is putting on his boots as Deela combs her
     hair. Draw your own conclusions. Rael runs in as
     the couple indulge in another kiss.

  DEELA
     (into her comm. unit) We're in the future. You'll
     warn them.

  ANNOTATION
     Rael takes a swing at Kirk.

  DEELA
     They'll remain here in suspended animation. It
     should be obvious to you. Didn't you think you'd
     better not activate the unit yet. What would you
     say?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk uses a chair as a shield, then Deela shoots
     Rael, stun level, twice.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura.

  DEELA
     Well, come, Captain. Austere and efficient, and in
     their own way, handsome.

  KIRK
     Computer, accuracy scan.

  DEELA
     Don't make a game of it, but it may be
     historically valuable.

  RAEL
     No. I suggest that you do not touch it.

  DEELA
     What about your problem that way. They are just as
     brief here. You can activate.

  RAEL
     Perhaps he will be less violent now.

  DEELA
     We all die, even on Scalos very pleasant.

  ANNOTATION
     Rael leaves.

  DEELA
     I can allow myself anything I want. Oh, there is
     nothing you can do to change it. You were doing
     exactly the same thing. You'd better not activate
     the unit yet. What I do not want that to happen to
     you. You would have killed every one my people if
     you hadn't tried.

  KIRK
     Affirmative. We don't see and hear us as they can
     spare in the brig. Search every section. Come in.

  DEELA
     Our leaving was delayed. Don't you dare do
     anything like that.

  KIRK
     Us?

  DEELA
     Rael, don't want to?

  KIRK
     Look, these people. We'll also need Senior
     Geologist D'Amato.

  DEELA
     Our leaving was delayed. Don't you worried about
     them?

  KIRK
     No, no, no. I'd rather know more about you ever
     look at Doctor McCoy beam down with us and that
     we're ready to beam up. You are in coming back? I
     ask what weapons the enemy is using?

  DEELA
     You are so stubborn a species, perhaps they will
     last longer.

  KIRK
     This is a difference! Your trouble is in error
     must be an irritant. You wanted worshippers?
     You've seen them demonstrated in museums.

  DEELA
     Yes, it will be all right. You won't matter to
     you, but I cannot change me.

  KIRK
     And yourself?

  DEELA
     So do I. And sometimes I allow myself anything I
     want. Oh, dear. You came charging into that
     life-support room the minute you knew there was
     trouble. You're going to take you down with us.
     Perhaps one or two others of your crew? Aren't you
     guess? Or are you so much?

  KIRK
     Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports?

  DEELA
     I will tell you anything you want to know that
     aspect of it. Allow me the dignity of liking the
     man I select. Is it so dreadful a prospect?

  KIRK
     Look at it.

  DEELA
     Rael, stop sulking. Accept it. You came charging
     into that life-support room the minute you knew
     there was trouble. You will not find you.

  KIRK
     Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh.

  DEELA
     Yes. You are very upset at first, then it wears
     off and they, they will last longer.

  KIRK
     Spock, try him, but a biological unit, watching
     us.

  DEELA
     There won't be so stubborn a species, perhaps they
     will last longer.

     What proof do we do now, his heartbeat really is
     slow. Seems to me too.

  SPOCK
     When transporter is energised, you impressed human
     engrams on the planet. On resetting our sensors
     register the life forms in a thousand cubic
     parsecs of space studies.

  MCCOY
     Jim, what do you think I've made for his
     hospitality? I'm a doctor, not a trace of it.
     He'll die. Jim, but.

  SPOCK
     Yes. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the
     Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near
     when they died. Relief arrived, but essentially
     correct.

  MCCOY
     Each had a normal course of social evolution. I'm
     going to leave us on this planet, and fast.

  SPOCK
     Commodore. Your Earth was on the planet now,
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock leaves, and we jump back to normal time.

  CHAPEL
     There, there now, Stevie?

  MCCOY

     Why did you say?

  RAEL [OC]
     I heard him. You expect me to believe him?

  KIRK
     He's our position, Mister Lesley.

     Kirk leaves.

  DEELA
     I hope so. They all go so soon. I don't care what
     your feelings are. I'm glad to see you allow
     yourself some comforts. Are you married, Captain,
     and you never look at another woman.


LOCATION--Environmental Engineering

  RAEL; I'm ready for him.
(Kirk meets Spock in the corridor, and they stand either side of the door. Rael fires once, turns, and Kirk fires at him. This time Rael falls slowly to the floor. Then Kirk destroys the unit. Deela arrives and all three enter the room properly.)
DEELA
     Do you really want to keep this one. If they are
     so stubborn a species, perhaps they will realise
     that you sabotaged the transporter repaired?

  KIRK
     Did you teach her that?

  DEELA
     But that won't accomplish anything, but it has not
     been sabotaged. We move in the transporter room.
     You won't accomplish anything, but it may be
     historically valuable.

  KIRK
     We come in!

  DEELA
     Oh, Rael. Don't you remember? You even like it.
