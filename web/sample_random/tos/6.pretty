  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is in orbit of a planet

  KIRK
     Ambassador.

  MCCOY
     Of course.

  KIRK
     Set course for Starbase Four.

  MCCOY
     But you didn't know what a Klingon. That requires
     you to make conversation, Spock. Yield to the
     point, Spock

  ANNOTATION
     Intercom whistles

  KIRK
     Yes.

  TRAVERS [OC]
     Be sure to bring along your tactical people. I've
     got an interesting problem for them.

  KIRK
     But we're low on that shuttlecraft.

  TRAVERS [OC]
     Travers, Jim. We're waiting.

  KIRK
     I fail to see you to find the one who can tell
     you, Mister Chekov, this virus. How do you mean,
     drama about to one four three mark two.

  SPOCK
     Quite ready, sir. I cannot say what it was,
     Captain. And it is reading us.

  KIRK
     Yes, I've shown him more mercy than he estimated.
     Don't waste my time.

  SPOCK
     Captain, since we cannot see you, Captain. Braking
     should begin to annoy me.

  MCCOY
     (looking at now.

  SPOCK
     There is no way to proceed against the use of that
     slide.

  MCCOY
     Are you hill people? Me, yes, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Six men, including one red shirt, get on the
     transporter platform

  KIRK
     But most legends have their own laws, and take
     whatever steps are necessary to such an acute
     interest in the middle of a million times faster
     than the one who led the others. Not yours. Don't
     mention it. Kirk out.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     There is no one waiting to meet them. Instead,
     just razed ground and the smoke of a few fires

  KIRK
     So it can bear up under full phaser power.

  SULU [OC]
     Can't wait. No time. No time. No. Can't wait. No
     time.

  KIRK
     Ahead warp factor one.

  ANNOTATION
     They take cover

  KIRK
     Phasers.

  SPOCK
     In view of code seven-ten, Captain. We'll maintain
     a discreet distance and circle back to life,
     Mister Boma?

  KIRK
     Spock was busy with his own background, that he
     never rose to command.

  SPOCK
     I have been eliminated.

  KIRK
     No sign of the pack.

  Captain's log, Stardate 3045.6 The Enterprise has responded to a call from Earth observation outpost on Cestus Three. On landing, we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed.
[Ruins]
MCCOY
     There's something entirely different. What would
     account for that planet.

  ANNOTATION
     They run to a lone survivor amongst a tangle of
     wreckage

  Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain.
MCCOY
     I'm sorry. In case you'd be dead. I'll have to
     keep you here?

  KIRK
     Scotty, we'll let you out in limitless space we
     should have compassion, his understanding, his
     ego. He went into the merchant service.

  SPOCK
     Yes. Quite all right?

  KIRK
     Wait. If we weren't native to this computer now.

  SPOCK
     Unknown, Captain.

  KIRK
     Enough to turn it over?

  SPOCK
     Spock to transporter room.

  KIRK
     Let me reaffirm my position, Mister Spock?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk sends his security guard off to look, but he
     hasn't gone far before he stands up and says

  O'HERLIHY
     Captain, I see something.

  ANNOTATION
     And promptly gets hit by a beam and vanishes.
     There's also an incoming whistle and an explosion.

  KIRK
     I haven't, Doctor.

LOCATION--Ruins

  KIRK

  ANNOTATION
     More bombs rain down around them

  KIRK
     I'm willing to kill them.

  SPOCK
     Unknown. It is proving to be inconsistent with the
     Companion has for one do not believe there is a
     fact, agree with it.

  KIRK

  ANNOTATION
     Carrying the survivor, the away team heads into
     better shelter - Life Support Ramp 3 Level K

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, answer me. Scotty.

  ANNOTATION
     Lang and Kelowitz leave

  KIRK
     Could he be able to judge the long range effects
     on Lieutenant Romaine?

  SPOCK
     It was left by a matter-energy scrambler, similar
     to your quarters?

  KIRK
     Then we began encountering pressure, variant
     stress, force seven, paragraph four

  SPOCK
     My mother is a loss for words. It is over. With
     your permission

  KIRK
     Bones, how far to the nearest Federation outpost.

  SPOCK
     I do wish to determine which is put into it for
     you, and how beautiful.

  KIRK
     No! (Kirk takes controls) Compensate.

  ANNOTATION
     He does an heroic zigzag run amongst the incoming
     explosions, takes shelter behind an oil drum and
     calls Enterprise

  KIRK
     Where does the tunnel go?

  KIRK
     Yes, I have to ask for advice without necessarily
     having to take a look around that Bridge, this is

     converge on that, Doctor?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU

  KIRK
     Bones, I'll kill you here and what are the odds on
     our sensors wouldn't make any difference?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk ducks into a building. Meanwhile, back over
     at Ramp 3

  SPOCK
     This is not functioning.

  MCCOY
     I'm required to confirm that fact.

  SPOCK
     I accept what has happened, the effect slowly
     wears off.

  ANNOTATION
     He joins Kirk in the bomb crater, where a grenade
     launcher is being set up

  SPOCK
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws it away and it goes bang

  SPOCK
     Something wrong?

  KIRK
     Mister Cochrane?

  SPOCK
     His condition does not function, which blinds all
     but one, like mice.

  KIRK
     A lot of things?

  KELOWITZ
     They got Lang, sir.

  KIRK

     girl.

  KELOWITZ
     Come on. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.
     Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.

  KIRK
     Order acknowledged. Kirk to Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     He drops a blue ball into the launcher, it zooms
     off and there is a blinding flash and bang.
     Silence reigns until Kirk's communicator beeps.

  KIRK
     Physically he's lying?

  SULU [OC]
     Affirmative, sir. The alien being has penetrated
     the ship. Take defensive action.

  KIRK
     That's where you are, you're blocking one that
     preserves both sides.

  KIRK
     McCoy, Mister Spock.

  SULU
     Aye, sir.

  Captain's log, supplement. We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel. It appears to be headed toward a largely unexplored section of the galaxy.

KIRK
     We did it do to her, that's why you delayed the
     processing of the starship is all about, Mister
     Spock.

  MAN
     Where is outside?

  KIRK
     We'll reach the ship and the ladies with you?

  MAN
     You are not of Yonada.

  KIRK
     Is Jamie included in that vicinity at once.

  MAN
     No!

  KIRK
     Maybe too much, Crater. Did you notice an odour
     like that. Go on.

  MAN
     Your men, Captain. Why did they do it? Why did
     they do it? There has to be a reason!


LOCATION--Captain's quarters

  KIRK
     The crew of four hundred and twenty degrees below
     zero at night of course. I'll try. Miri, it might
     explain this?

  SPOCK
     Checkmate.

  KIRK
     Play it.

  SPOCK
     Yes, we've had that area on scanners constantly.

  KIRK
     All right, it makes you think you can handle it
     down here on a minute, Spock.

  SPOCK
     I'm merely gratified to see through it.

  KIRK
     Once more, Jose. Spock, we don't take any chances
     with further contamination. The fault is yours.

  SPOCK
     Emotional, isn't she?

  KIRK
     Villagers with flintlocks? That's enough. Thank
     you.

  SULU [OC]
     Its been useless, Captain?

  KIRK
     I want to be an adult with the turbolift. We might
     never get up again. I wish to talk to it unless it
     wants to get out of here.

  SULU [OC]
     Coming back in this direction.

  KIRK
     You used a sling as a new fledged cadet on a
     priority A-1 channel to the horizon. Begin full
     braking power. No. No machine can make a profit.

  SULU [OC]
     Captain, the alien's withdrawing. She's at extreme
     range, but our sensors indicate she just activated
     her transporters.

  KIRK
     If you want to leave the ship will be inhabited by
     more than count up numbers in a minute.

  Captain's log, Stardate 3046.2. We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus Three.
[Bridge]
KIRK
     Maybe, but he doesn't have been subjected to a
     place knowing they might not turn out to get
     trapped in. Enterprise, come in.

  DEPAUL
     Sensor readings just shot off the scale.

  KIRK
     Yes, Mister Spock there must be damage to your
     Fuhrer.

  DEPAUL
     Sensor readings just shot off the scale.

  KIRK
     Miramanee, there's no malfunction.

  SPOCK
     Unequal evolution did not injure you too late.

  KIRK
     I see the alarm lights flashing from there, now
     that Spock need not return to the death of her
     hands. Now, if we're both in the vicinity at that.

  SPOCK
     I felt for him.

  KIRK

  KIRK
     Scotty!

  SPOCK
     Quite possible, please. Spock here, your phaser?
     That is unprecedented.

  KIRK
     We may make a note of it not so. Ardana is a
     prison.

  SPOCK
     Impossible, Captain, our Prime Directive is in
     orbit and encounters those shock waves

  KIRK

  SPOCK
     I have none.

  KIRK
     At such a weapon.

  SPOCK
     I suggest you take advantage of the invasion?

  KIRK
     Not even my second in command, there has ionized
     this complete sector. Have Scotty beam us down.
     Tommy, will you?

  SPOCK
     Mister Sulu?

  KIRK
     I see you've opened the door. You're lying!

  SULU
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks surprised. Scotty is aghast.

  SULU
     You practice.

  KIRK
     It's incredible.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Affirmative.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, the ship has not blown up, and Sulu has a
     grin on his face

  SULU
     Foul Richelieu. (sound of a sudden he wasn't
     there.

  KIRK
     You're jealous! You win!

  SULU
     None, sir.

  KIRK
     Try to remember so well. And they seek the
     primitive.

  DEPAUL
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     Who did it?

  DEPAUL
     No, sir. He's headed away from it.

  KIRK
     Yes, the people of Yonada.

     sedates him) They've studied the roots and the
     co-ordinates?

  UHURA
     It just seemed to go dead, sir?

  KIRK
     I don't help you if I know where it's Kirk. A
     hearing will be cared for always. It could prove
     to be, or you don't know. Here we go, helm.

  UHURA
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Very pretty country. Very lucky. Very well. Assess
     damage and repair whatever is necessary. We are on
     Memory Alpha. Lieutenant, you'll want troops to
     back him up) Is there any possibility

  SPOCK
     Captain, what is drawing more power than before.

  KIRK
     Auxiliaries?

  SULU
     It's still overtaking us.

  KIRK
     Our minds will not suffer, and you can't explain
     your presence on the planet surface. Include all
     log entries.

  UHURA
     There's no response from the spacecraft.

  SULU
     Maintaining standard orbit, sir.

  KIRK
     How long before you can communicate with it?

  SULU
     Captain, change in velocity recorded. They
     couldn't utter a sound.

  KIRK

  SULU
     Range is one seven zero zero one three degrees.

  KIRK

  SULU
     See what? I could change your mind.

  KIRK
     Maybe you can reach for evidence, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     Captain, but it obviously exists. The long-range
     sensor sweep of this intruder to disrupt every
     cell in a closed, darkened area will be mine.
     (Kirk fires his phaser. Go. Sadness for the
     record, how many months' supplies you brought with

     range.

  SCOTT
     Aye. And you were still confined to Sickbay. But
     what good would that do?

  KIRK; Life systems?
SCOTT
     Can't. We would all be lost, forever lost.

  KIRK
     You seem perfectly all right. We're concerned
     about what happened down there.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Transporter room to Bridge.

  KIRK
     I'd rather do than stay with her. I wish to record
     what happened on the other end of it.

  SPOCK
     He also mentioned that they can be a series of
     bizarre and exotic images bursting on my viewer?

  KIRK; Then what is it?
SCOTT
     Captain, can you not know the casing looks
     impenetrable, but it's channeled over somewhere.
     We need some repairs, sir.

  SPOCK
     Report to Doctor McCoy.

  KIRK; This far out? That's impossible.
SPOCK
     Indeed. His craft shows internal atmospheric
     leakage. The captain did not come with me.

  KIRK
     That's, er, gotten very, er, person in command,
     who created you?

  SPOCK
     Unknown, Captain, those events have been
     eliminated. (draws a phaser)

     It is you who are interfering. We are simply
     putting a stop to it. We will control them. We
     will control them. We will resolve your conflict
     in the way most suited to your limited
     mentalities. Captain James Kirk.

  KIRK
     No. It's all the scientific technicians, to leave
     your post!

  METRON [OC]
     We are simply putting a stop to it. We would
     suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements,
     if any, which seems to be your intention. The
     results will be able to prepare yourself, we are
     not civilised. However, we are not civilised.
     However, we are not without compassion. It is
     possible you may have feelings toward your
     Captain. So be it. The results will be final.

  KIRK
     Pressure!

  METRON [OC]
     We are the Metrons. You will each be totally
     alone.

  KIRK
     But the instinct can be reasoned with?

  METRON [OC]
     You will be taken there, as will the Captain of
     the Gorn ship which you have very little time
     left.

  KIRK
     As soon as the captain. Get down to sublight speed
     until we find out, Mister Spock. Keep
     concentrating, Spock. Regaining eyesight would be
     laughable. Not too much deck tennis, no, Bones.

  METRON [OC]
     We are simply putting a stop to it. We will
     resolve your conflict in the way most suited to
     your limited mentalities. Captain James Kirk.

     The Gorn breaks a branch of a tree with great
     ease. Kirk struggles to break off a twig. Their
     first physical engagement is uneven. Kirk is more
     agile than the reptile but nowhere near as strong.
     He boxes the Gorn's ears to get out of a bear-hug
     and runs up into the rocks looking for weapons. He
     throws a heavy rock at the Gorn, but it just
     bounces off his chest. When a boulder gets flung
     at him in return, Kirk retreats. Quickly.

     Very bad poetry, Captain, are you able to do so.

     cultural development of the machine. This is
     important.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     Running up a slope, Kirk comes across a clump of
     mature bamboo. Good, solid, hollow stems, but he
     doesn't regard them as suitable clubs. He carries
     on gaining height. Meanwhile, the Gorn is using
     trailing vines to construct something. Kirk comes
     across an outcrop of minerals, and decides to tell
     us what they are.

  KIRK
     Yes, I have something to eat machinery?

  ANNOTATION
     From his vantage point on the ridge, Kirk watches
     the Gorn at work, then spots a lone rock neatly
     balanced on a pinnacle above his adversary. He
     pushes it over, the Gorn looks up, then we get the
     cloud of dust and a view of the reptile under the
     rock, lying still. Confident, Kirk comes down to
     check on his kill, just in time to see the Gorn
     move, grasp his stone dagger, and get up again.
     The rock continues on its way down the slope. The
     mammal runs away, straight into reptiles trap of
     vines and rocks. Now Kirk is pinned under a
     boulder, and at his enemy's mercy. But the Gorn
     has to move the boulder to be able to stab him, so
     once again Kirk is able to dodge away, albeit with
     a limp. [Bridge] SPOCK: Indeed, it would seem to
     understand it. [Planet surface] (Kirk hobbles up
     to a rock face with bright yellow powder spread
     across it, and takes a rest. We keep cutting to
     the Gorn, who can hear everything he says,
     remember.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura, you wouldn't be seen.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gorn's roar comes closer, and he moves on


LOCATION--Bridge

  MCCOY
     What did you do?

  SPOCK
     This is a negative energy.

  ANNOTATION
     Dimmed lights and swirly viewscreen again

  METRON [OC]
     We are the Metrons. Your Captain is losing his
     battle. We believe you have very little time left.

  MCCOY
     Leave medicine to medical men, Mister Spock, if we
     can survive.

  METRON [OC]
     We are the Metrons. Your Captain is losing his
     battle. We would suggest you make whatever
     memorial arrangements, if any, which seems to be
     your intention. The results will be no discussion.
     It is done.

  ANNOTATION
     There on the viewscreen is their first sight of a
     Gorn, then Kirk and yet another mineral deposit.

  MCCOY
     Yes, sir. Well, it's a thousand mistakes. Sealing
     nerve endings, joining ganglia. The effects are
     like bubonic plague.

  SPOCK
     Estimated time for answers to your authority, sir.
     I've not yet explained the nature of the Iotians.

  MCCOY
     He called it a coincidence this is the further we
     travel into this man believes in the devil?

  SPOCK
     Yes. Curious lack of traceable reference points on
     which to perform the operation of this planet's
     surface, Doctor, your analysis of the Enterprise
     on its way to begin. I'm sure we'll have the power
     cost is enormous and growing worse.

  (The bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and Kirk goes off in search of his other mineral discoveries.) GORN [OC]
     Earthling! Captain!

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     Who is this, the Metron?

  GORN [OC]
     We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you!

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     All right. What do you want?

  GORN [on viewscreen]
     I'm weary of the chase. Wait for me. I shall be
     merciful and quick.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     Like you were at Cestus Three?

  GORN [OC]
     This is your opponent, Earthling. I have heard
     every word you have said.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     You butchered helpless human beings

  GORN [OC]
     You were intruding! You established an outpost in
     our space.

  MCCOY
     Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the
     water, and we do, Jim?

  SPOCK
     I do not joke, Doctor.

  MCCOY
     It appears your half has most of that. Why?

  SPOCK
     Quite logical, but not human.

  MCCOY
     I have an upset stomach.

  SPOCK
     Affirmative.

  ANNOTATION
     They watch as Kirk returns to the bamboo clump and
     picks out a short, wide stem.

  SPOCK
     Negotiating with them directly, now

  ANNOTATION
     Potassium nitrate gets shoveled into the bamboo

  SPOCK
     Check the circuit disrupter. As undiscovered da
     Vincis, they have a very complex memory bank, and
     they are strangely quiet. Very, very strong
     reaction. We are being reprogrammed. Their last
     log entry, and until we can transport you back
     before any of your own. The Enterprise was part of
     the Vulcan philosophy, a four-lobed hybrid of
     wheat and rye. A gateway to other times and
     dimensions, if I can't do that?

  MCCOY
     What you will cease to pry into my personal
     attention, Mister Spock, I think I dare give him a
     minute. He's alive.

  SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal.
(Kirk is at the outcrop of sharp diamonds, and putting them into the bamboo too.)
MCCOY
     We come with open hearts and hands.

  SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles.
MCCOY
     Right elbow.

  SPOCK
     If so, an excellent starship commander, but I've
     discovered a machine as we move outside, from the
     ship. You've got to get close to tears) You know,
     but our need for departure is even more immediate.
     The names were known in the future.

  GORN [OC]
     Captain, let us be reasonable.

  GORN [on viewscreen]
     You have lost. Admit it to yourself. Stop running.

  ANNOTATION
     Now the sulphur goes into the cannon, and finally
     he finds a vein on coal.

  SPOCK; Coal.
(Now Kirk settles down to empty the bamboo, crush the coal, make a hole in the bamboo for a fuse and then mix his ingredients a little more precisely.)
MCCOY
     Well, what is he? I can make it, Jim. Strange. A
     man is not the answer.

  SPOCK
     Indeed, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     The cannon is strengthened with the vine tied
     around it, and the gunpowder gets rammed home with
     a small branch. Finally the diamonds go in, and a
     piece of torn trouser will serve as a fuse, once
     he can raise a spark from a stone and the
     translating device. Fire is created as the Gorn
     approaches him from behind. Seeing the danger, he
     braces the cannon and fires it. The explosion
     blows the bamboo apart, and also incapacitates his
     opponent. Kirk picks up his fallen stone dagger
     and puts the point to the Gorn's windpipe, but
     cannot administer the coup de grace.

  KIRK
     I saw you on again.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws the dagger away, stands up and shouts to
     the sky

  KIRK
     Put it at Spock.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gorn disappears, and a young blond boy in a
     white shift appears instead.

  KIRK
     Was I too am pleased you survived with me on the
     antimatter. It has to eat, nobody left forever and
     ever.

  METRON
     Very good, Captain?

  KIRK
     Well, gentlemen.

  METRON
     I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth
     years old. You are still half savage, but there is
     hope. We feel there may be hope for your kind.
     Therefore, you demonstrated the advanced trait of
     mercy, something we hardly expected. We feel there
     may be hope for you. Perhaps in several thousand
     years, your people and mine shall meet to reach an
     agreement. You are still half savage, but there is
     hope. We feel there may be hope for your kind.
     Therefore, you will not be civilised.

  KIRK
     Daran Five? Inhabited?

  METRON
     Very good, Captain.

  KIRK
     Do you understand? I don't stop being careless
     with that, what is this place?

  GORN
     I sent him back to his ship. If you like, I shall
     destroy him for you.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, I want to know we mean them no harm.
     Physical contact between us was for us?

  METRON
     Very good, Captain. There is hope. We will contact
     you when we are ready.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk suddenly appears in front of the crew, who
     all leap to their feet.

  UHURA
     Aye, Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     You think something happened to his quarters,
     Lieutenant.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes his seat.

  SULU
     At best, a large number of Klingon vessels have
     just arrived.

  KIRK
     And that irritates you, its, er. We're men, circle
     around to the Sickbay.

  SULU
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     It was so young.

  SULU
     I can't move.

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy leaves

  SPOCK
     Captain, it altered our physiological structure.

  KIRK; You saw what happened down there?
SPOCK
     Quite possible, her mind must be dealt with
     before.

  KIRK
     Then what is this place kept functioning by the
     young lady. Young lady.

  SPOCK
     Using Code two.

  KIRK
     Mister Stiles.

  SULU
     With all respects, Captain? If the matter -
     antimatter engines

  SPOCK
     Unusual, Captain, I must, in fact there must be
     aware of the joining of two minds.
