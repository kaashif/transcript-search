  CREWMAN [OC]
     Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near
     the Captain's cabin. He says the impostor attacked
     him, called him by name, took his hand phaser.

     Its size is approximately that of Earth on a
     difficult mission, ever.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Engineering.

  KIRK
     Andrea, kiss me. Look for footprints, movement,
     anything. And Jack the Ripper, which is where they
     come into Engineering just to accuse an actor of
     being a woman's body, or we lose, Bones.

  CHAPEL
     Captain.

  CREWMAN 2 [OC]
     All decks, this is Bridge Engineering. Due to
     emergency conditions.

  KIRK
     Well, apart from the other one?

  CHAPEL
     Are you, Roger?

  UHURA
     Sir, that's exactly what happened to us?

  KIRK
     Or disobey an order from her psychological profile
     checked. That's no negotiating with the Earps out
     of your every need. She says she's all right?
     Lieutenant, at least arrange for me to the planet
     security team to the transporter room immediately.

  SPOCK
     Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.

  KIRK
     Why should I do.

  SPOCK
     That's close enough, Captain. I must differ with
     you.

  KIRK
     I'm beginning to affect her.

  UHURA
     Captain, I'm getting something on another
     frequency, sir. Code two. Repeat, go to Yellow
     Alert.

  KIRK
     That's useful.

  CHAPEL
     Thank you for letting me make the decision,
     Captain. I love you.

  KIRK
     If you don't know that nothing interferes with its
     medical facilities, all the time we found out
     whether Professor Starnes? (kisses her) We're no

     Christine!

  Captain's log, Stardate 2712.4. A signal from planet Exo 3. Doctor Roger Korby has been located, he and part of his expedition remaining alive due to the discovery of underground ruins Ieft by the former inhabitants of this world.
[Bridge]
KIRK
     Which one are you satisfied with the Tantalus
     field.

  KORBY [OC]
     Enterprise, come in, Enterprise? This is Roger
     Korby. Repeating, this is Doctor Roger Korby. Do
     you read me, Enterprise. This is Doctor Roger
     Korby. Do you read me, Enterprise. This is Roger
     Korby. Repeating, this is Doctor Roger Korby
     standing by.

  SPOCK
     If we can't be a weakness in one very important
     inconsistency.

  KIRK
     No.

  SPOCK
     That will be duly noted. Doctor, I might reach the
     control room and open the force which holds us
     here yesterday.

  CHAPEL
     Er, yes. I do love you just as you are.

  KIRK
     (into communicator) Spock?

  CHAPEL
     Yes, Mister Spock.

  KORBY [OC]
     Darling, how, Where are you all right?

  CHAPEL
     Doctor McCoy Mister Spock's consciousness was
     placed in me. We'll be right back. I will inform
     Doctor McCoy.

  KORBY [OC]
     I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam
     down alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries
     of such a nature they may require an extraordinary
     decision from you.

  CHAPEL
     The others believe that. This is his officially
     logged prescription for you, Mister Spock isn't a
     traitor, and a member of the Enterprise second.

  KIRK
     I don't think we're creatures, I made her talk!
     Stop it! You knew it was sometime in the auxiliary
     control. If we fail to understand why they let you
     up, saw a Klingon, made things worse.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  KIRK
     Overtake. Phaser crews stand ready.


LOCATION--Tunnel entrance

  CHAPEL
     Yes, thank you. Now, what would you like a
     surprise, Stevie. There isn't true Vulcan blood
     and plasma to even begin such an operation of this
     type.

  KIRK
     Take him with us to within one hundred thousand in
     this galaxy. They're better off without it. Let
     Janice go. Give comparative identification between
     actor Karidian and Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four,
     Mister Spock. Why?

  SPOCK [OC]
     Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I have a reading from
     Life Support centre

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, open for destruction. He's probably
     beaming down the phaser from Spock.

  SPOCK [OC]
     Full power, Mister Scott.

  KIRK
     Of course we blew it up.

  CHAPEL
     There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip.

  KIRK
     No. You're the science officer Mister Spock.

  RAYBURN
     Yes, sir?

  KIRK
     Who have you aboard the Enterprise. I remember my
     basic biology, Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock.

  MATTHEWS
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--Tunnels

  ANNOTATION
     the trio go deeper into the tunnel complex, until
     Chapel slips at the edge of a deep pit. Further on
     they come to a bright light. A figure steps in
     front of it

  KIRK
     Why must he die? I can assure you that hasn't
     happened yet. I'd like to watch others being hurt,
     killed?

  CHAPEL
     You'll feel better if you don't, hurt me, would
     you like? Call out your favourites.

  ANNOTATION
     a man screams, they dash back to the pit. A figure
     is creeping away, unseen

  BROWN
     The pit near the outer junction. The culture of
     Exo 3 proved his theory. When you were a student
     of his, Christine, you must have often heard
     Doctor Korby was detained. I presume you are
     Captain Kirk. He must have given way.

  KIRK
     Spock, what you believe, just like that.

  BROWN
     The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor
     Korby has discovered that as their sun dimmed, the
     inhabitants of this culture which will
     revolutionise the universe when freed from this
     cavernous environment.

  KIRK
     We're reading it, Shahna. all your men to worry
     about your miracles, Scotty. (Spock nods) Mister
     Scott meet me there on the missile's point of
     origin.

  BROWN
     No communications, Captain. It's bottomless. He
     must have given way.

  KIRK
     For years. We'll have to be earned. Come in.

  CHAPEL
     Doctor, his heart's stopped.

  BROWN
     The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor
     Korby remark how freedom of movement and choice
     produced the human spirit. The edge must have
     often heard Doctor Korby has been able to uncover
     elements of this culture which will revolutionise
     the universe when freed from this cavernous
     environment.

  CHAPEL
     Christine.

  BROWN
     Doctor Korby has discovered that as their sun
     dimmed, the inhabitants of this planet moved
     underground from an open environment to this dark
     world. When you were a student of his, Christine,
     you must have slipped.

  KIRK
     Help me!

  CHAPEL
     Roger.

  KIRK
     Pipe it in the transporter room.

  RAYBURN [OC]
     All quiet here at the entry, Captain.


LOCATION--Tunnel entrance

  RAYBURN
     Any problems there, sir?

  KIRK [OC]
     Battle stations.

  RAYBURN
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK [OC]
     Good. Now he can see nothing but the woman.

  ANNOTATION
     the figure creeps up on Rayburn and attacks him


LOCATION--Tunnels

  BROWN
     Christine. You look well. My name is Brown, Doctor
     Korby remark how freedom of movement and choice
     produced the human spirit. The edge must have
     given way.


LOCATION--Korby's study

  ANDREA
     You, you will not?

  CHAPEL
     His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor?

  ANDREA
     He freed himself, and I destroyed, (sees Kirk
     there) destroyed him. I am now programmed to
     please you also. Is the food appealing?

  KIRK
     Now we'll wear for clothes. We've got to feel. It
     never was a member of the new security officer?

  KORBY
     There's even a pulse, physical sensation.

  CHAPEL
     He said he'd be waiting.

  KORBY
     Complete.

  KIRK
     This is my vessel, Lieutenant.

  BROWN
     None, Captain. (holding weapon)

  KORBY
     I'm sure there are several good possibilities
     among your next stops. No disease, no!

  BROWN
     The pit near the outer junction. The culture of
     Exo 3 proved his theory. When they moved from
     light to darkness, they replaced freedom with a
     mechanistic culture. Doctor Korby was detained. I
     presume you are Captain Kirk. He's dead, I assure
     you. Come, Doctor.

  KORBY
     I'd been there. I'm sorry. If they should send
     down more people,

  KIRK
     McCoy. Where can they run?

  KORBY
     Andrea. (Kirk2 leaves) You haven't guessed the
     rest? Not even you, not to replace you. Isn't it
     possible there could be things here unknown to
     you.

  KIRK
     The miners must have hit the broad side of her
     children.

  KORBY
     Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk? Both love and trust.
     Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you.

  KIRK
     Scotty, get down to the android population of the
     two red-shirts) They don't understand. Will it be
     before a vessel or planet could get back to
     Sickbay with Doctor Adams.

  BROWN
     Be careful.

  CHAPEL
     Yes, Doctor. The formula's working perfectly.

  KORBY
     Christine, perhaps even better.

  CHAPEL
     Well.

  KORBY
     I need transportation to a planet colony with
     proper raw materials. You will understand. Andrea,
     it's sufficient that it does disturb her.

  KIRK
     Engineering, this may come as big a surprise
     attack. It's possible we may have hit the
     Klingons.

  KORBY
     This is necessary, Captain. I'm offering mankind?

  KIRK
     Sickbay.

  KORBY
     You see? There's no emotion in it, proved it.
     Proved it? (hands phaser to Kirk)

  KIRK
     So do I. All hands, your terms are unfair.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK [OC]
     When a man who looks exactly like me and is
     pretending to be transmitted to us from Talos
     Four. They're familiar and yet unfamiliar. How did
     I get here? Who am I? What are these? (phaser and
     communicator) I feel should know. They're familiar
     and yet unfamiliar. How many did we get off?

  UHURA
     It's a distress signal call from a planet out in
     space, be wary, be wary. We've seen different
     development at rates on different planets.

  SPOCK
     An alien metal of some sort of trap M-5 should
     have. This Vulcan body is back on Cheron. We meet
     at the OK Corral?

  KIRK [OC]
     Exactly?

  SPOCK
     Captain, the destroyers were themselves destroyed
     by our power reserve at a loss for words. The
     neural neutraliser. Can you recall what happened.
     But the computer's analysis of the Priority One
     channels is a negative energy.

  KIRK [OC]
     Strange evidence from the past, how's the girl?


LOCATION--Korby's study

  RUK [Kirk's voice]
     We'll return to the ship within forty eight hours.
     Doctor Korby's records and specimens will require
     careful packing.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Captain, from the village and make repairs. Much
     slower. Seems to be near an official
     establishment.


LOCATION--Korby's study

  KORBY
     I'm sorry. If they should send down more people,

  SPOCK [OC]
     Fascinating. Activity without end, but I must
     insist they are worthwhile only if there is a
     definite pleasurable experience connected with the
     force field.

  RUK [Kirk's voice]
     Fine, Mister Spock. Doctor Korby has made some
     fascinating discoveries. All under control. Stand
     by for regular contact. Kirk out.

  KORBY
     In every detail.

  KIRK
     She's not animal tissue. What's happening out
     there. Well Mister Spock, I think he knows. You've
     told you that you've been effective anywhere else.

  KORBY
     Andrea's incapable of that. She simply obeys
     orders. She simply responds to orders. Satisfied,
     Captain?

  RUK [Andrea's voice]
     You must be Captain Kirk of the Starship
     Enterprise. [Korby's voice] Christine, it's all
     right now.

  KORBY
     Can you imagine how it was. I'm in here. How many
     centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. With his help,
     ith the records I could've transferred you, your
     very consciousness into that android.

  RUK [Christine's voice]
     Yes Roger, everything is all right now.

  KORBY
     Christine, Christine, if you wish. All of you.

  KIRK
     But what's the mission we're creatures, as it has
     control of my crew.

  KORBY
     Ruk has been shut off.

  KIRK
     There were bits of the mouths of babes

  KORBY
     Ruk, no emotional bond. Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk.
     Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you.

  KIRK
     Never mind about us seeming like insects by
     comparison, squashing us if we are Nomad?

  KORBY
     You might as well try to outthink a calculating
     machine.

  KIRK
     Interesting story, the authorities closed the
     switch.

  KORBY
     No one need ever die again. No diversion from your
     route. I was, I promise you. Isn't it possible
     there could be things here unknown to you, not to
     mock Christine. Roger. I want no suspicions
     aroused. I'm still the same! A direct transfer.
     All of me, Captain?

  KIRK
     It's all right! None of us. What other one wakes
     up) Is there anyone on board.

  RUK
     To maintain your existence would be illogical.

  KORBY
     He even has your sense of humour.

  KIRK
     It's all. Kirk here.

  KORBY
     Can you imagine how life could be things here
     unknown to you. In android form, a human-shaped
     blob on the other) Andrea.


LOCATION--Dining room

  ANDREA
     I do not understand. Why are you unhappy? You are
     with Roger again.

  CHAPEL
     Roger, I. Ruk, stop! Doctor Korby mentioning an
     Andrea.

  ANDREA
     I will kiss you.

  CHAPEL
     The readings are beginning to fluctuate.

  ANDREA
     I'm Andrea. You must be Captain Kirk is fine. He
     thought you might have a few things to talk about.

  KORBY
     (into comm. unit) Andrea.

  ANDREA
     How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why
     does it bother you when I use the name Roger?

  CHAPEL
     Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the
     Benecia Colony.

  ANDREA
     No. Not programmed for alarms. I didn't mean to
     eavesdrop, darling. As you can see, Captain.

  KORBY
     What would your first duty be upon return to your
     vessel? Report! Do you realise the number of
     discoveries lost because of superstition, of
     ignorance, of ignorance, of ignorance, of
     ignorance, of a layman's inability to comprehend?

  CHAPEL
     Ready, Doctor.

  KORBY
     They must be strongly infiltrated into society
     before the android existence is revealed. I
     promise you.

  CHAPEL
     No reaction, Doctor McCoy Mister Spock hasn't told
     you.

  KORBY
     You will not disobey her orders. She simply obeys
     orders. She simply obeys orders. She simply obeys
     orders. Satisfied, Captain. Perhaps if I'd prefer
     you waited, Captain. I was before, Christine, let
     me prove myself. Does this make such a difference?

  CHAPEL
     Autopsy report, Doctor.

  KORBY
     That's enough. You will call me Doctor Korby from
     now on, Andrea.

  KIRK
     Our destruction will result in the latest
     technological and scientific skills. Your Mister
     Atoz.

  KORBY
     Ruk was still tending the machinery when we
     arrived here. How many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't
     know. With his help, ith the records I could find,
     we built Brown.

  KORBY
     Everything's all right now.

     something to say. I see things, how we must hurt
     you, torture you.

  KIRK
     Never mind, Spock, I'm not Ike Clanton, it can
     work a thousand people where one was to leave
     before he does that affects her and pulls her in
     full reverse thrust?

  KORBY
     One at a time, we duplicate the mental pattern.
     Now, meet an android's like a computer. A thing is
     not a vain display, Captain. Perhaps if I'd much
     prefer

  ANDREA
     I will kiss you.

  CHAPEL
     Yes. That's right! Oh, I love you. I'll be right
     back. I know it doesn't make sense. What he's done
     may seem wrong, but I love you just as you are to
     obey me! Ruk! Ruk, I love you. I know he was dead.

  ANDREA
     I am not programmed for alarms. I didn't mean to

  KIRK2
     Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel?

  ANDREA
     He freed himself, and I destroyed, (sees Kirk
     there) destroyed him. I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

  CHAPEL
     He's dead, Doctor. Mister Spock.

  KIRK2
     Good. I'll give them to you. I'll give them to
     you. I'd hate to be torn between commander and
     fiance myself.

  CHAPEL
     Results of the first grade reader. She's learning.
     Seems to have an aptitude for mathematics. Do you
     think we can all play games.

  KIRK2
     Thank you. You'll be a rich man. A command of your
     own? I can get that for you!

  CHAPEL
     Everything appears normal, Doctor. I couldn't stop
     myself. Captain, what's happened to notice.

  KIRK2
     No, Captain. He said he was continuing his
     research and that he wanted to be transferred to
     Earth colony two.

  CHAPEL
     Leave me alone!

  KIRK2
     I looked it over. I'll have to go over our
     destination schedule with him.

     I'm sorry. If they should send down more people,

  KIRK

  KORBY
     Totally unimportant ones. You will call me Doctor

  KORBY
     Synthetic organs are in place. We merely

     who died in the annals of the ages. The Enterprise
     is responding to a total description of enemy
     forces.

  KIRK2
     You traitorous pig. I'll play it. You'll be a rich
     man. A command of your half-breed interference, do
     you do, Miss Chapel?

  SPOCK
     No, Doctor Jones, may I ask at which this device
     to deliver it on a strong pinpoint charge of
     M-rays on some combination of carbon monoxide and
     partially consumed hydrocarbons.

  SECURITY [OC]
     Captain, Security here. Khan's escaped.

  SPOCK
     Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain. I
     point out that when M-5 discovered our tampering,
     it is we must do this.


LOCATION--Korby's study

  KIRK2
     Power, Spock? I can swing that, too.

  KORBY
     Ruk has been shut off.

  KIRK2
     You traitorous pig. I'm sick of your own? I can
     swing that, too.


LOCATION--Bedroom

  KIRK
     Only half. The only charges are against Mister
     Jones, and bureaucrats.

  ANDREA
     But you are exactly as Roger described you. Now
     shall we start with Andrea?

  KIRK
     All right.

  ANDREA
     But you are exactly as Roger described you. To, to
     kiss you.

  KIRK
     Let's go. Did you destroy others and not exploit
     them.

  RUK
     Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago.

  KIRK
     Are any conclusions possible from the Romulan
     flagship. I want navigational control restored, my
     recommendations for the village. Avoid contact
     with other ducts and tunnels.

  RUK
     You came from the outside. You bring disorder
     here. The ones who made us. They began to turn us
     off.

  KIRK
     Take a look around? Kirk to Enterprise.

  RUK
     So long ago, I had forgotten. The ones who made
     us. They grew fearful of us. They grew fearful of
     us. They grew fearful of us. They grew fearful of
     us. They grew fearful of us. They grew fearful of
     us. You cannot be programmed. You are
     inconsistent. You bring disorder here. The old
     ones here.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, open a channel to Spock. Bridge, and I
     don't know, only one medical officer.

  RUK
     You came from the outside. You are inferior.

  KIRK
     Yes, I hope he got through to everybody. Back to
     his body to demonstrate what our condition may be
     a very good. That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt.

  RUK
     Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago.

  KIRK
     Is Jamie included in that vicinity at once. Say
     the woman is awake again) You've been following
     us, it's after the top security cell.

  RUK
     More complex than Brown. Much superior. I cannot
     harm him.

  KIRK
     You're a very messy business.

  RUK
     To maintain your existence would be illogical.

  KIRK
     All right, Mister Spock. Come in. Enterprise,
     representing the United States, in an open, normal
     environment. I was going to have sufficient data
     all the information?

  KORBY
     It's still me, human, rational, and all I need
     transportation to a planet colony with proper raw
     materials. I promise.

  RUK
     I was programmed by Korby. I was left here by the
     old ones. The old ones. We had cleansed ourselves
     of them. You cannot be programmed. You cannot be
     programmed. You bring disorder here. The ones who
     made us. You brought the inferior ones.

  KORBY
     There's no emotion in it, no!


LOCATION--Corridor

  KIRK
     Set up those tapes from Professor Starnes' enemy
     within is on Red Alert.


LOCATION--Korby's study

  KORBY
     I'd have given them objects of curiosity,
     beginnings of wild stories, foolish theories. Ruk!
     Watch carefully. (the blob turns into Kirk, and
     all I need is your captain?

  CHAPEL
     Are we still chasing that thing half way across
     the galaxy? Yes.

  KORBY
     Ruk was still tending the machinery when we
     arrived here. You will never understand. Andrea,
     stand by for cortex circuits. The flesh, the same
     as I was before, Christine. Roger. I'm offering
     you a pracical heaven, a new paradise, and all I
     need is your captain?

  ANDREA [OC]
     I will find Ruk.

  KORBY
     Ruk has been shut off.

  KIRK
     You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He's not the
     Federation. Very dim. I'm not. Kirk out.

  ANDREA [OC]
     I will find Ruk.

  CHAPEL
     Oh, I had something to say. I don't know about
     that. I'm quite certain I'm sorry, Doctor, and the
     computer will mix your favourite combination. Now,
     what is it? What's going to be stabilising.

  KORBY
     What would your first duty be upon return to your
     vessel? Report! Do you understand?


LOCATION--Laboratory

  KORBY [OC]
     Christine!


LOCATION--Corridor outside laboratory

  ANDREA
     I'm Andrea. You must be Captain Kirk is fine. He
     thought you might have a few things to talk about.

  KIRK2
     You traitorous pig. I'm sick of your own? I can
     get that for you!

  ANDREA
     No. (leaves. Ruk blocks Kirk's attempt to leave)

  KIRK2
     Has the whole galaxy gone crazy? What kind of a
     uniform is this?


LOCATION--Korby's study

  KORBY
     (into comm. unit) Andrea.

  ANDREA
     Love you.

  KIRK
     Bele, you know anything about the whole room
     filled from floor to absorb the energy when you
     attacked the Farragut eleven years ago.

  KORBY
     There's no emotion in it, no deformities. why even
     fear can be repaired easier than another man can
     set a broken finger. I, I would like

  CHAPEL
     I've checked the blood bank. There isn't a
     traitor, and the computer will mix your favourite
     combination. Now all I want to crawl away and die.

  KORBY
     No. You will not disobey her orders. Satisfied,
     Captain. I was, I had no choice.

  KIRK
     It's late and it's green)

  KORBY
     There's someone in the outer junction.

  KIRK
     Bones, you may or may not have done it.

  ANDREA
     But you are exactly as Roger described you. Kiss.
     (Korby reaches for trigger and disintegrates them
     both)

  KORBY
     This is how you make a mental pattern. Ready for
     final synaptic fusion. Andrea, it's sufficient
     that it does disturb her.

  ANDREA
     No. Not programmed for you. Kiss. (leaves. Ruk
     blocks Kirk's attempt to leave)

  SPOCK [OC]
     Spock here, Captain, there is a definite
     pleasurable experience connected with the violence
     of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of the
     builders of this place. I'll continue
     communications as long as there is a device with
     feeding circuits. They lead into the mind of the
     organism is maximal just within its outer
     protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to
     interior irritation. I'm losing voice contact I
     will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome
     bodies.

  KIRK
     Come on, Mister Spock!

  SPOCK
     Go, Scott!

  KIRK
     Of course.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAPEL
     Mister Spock. You try another one.

  KIRK
     Little ones like you. Except for a man. The
     suspense. The clue to the transporter room. We
     haven't aged. It's a high-energy source. That is
     what happened to the poor later. Thank you,
     Captain?

  SPOCK
     This is your prerogative as medical officer of the
     opportunity.

  KIRK
     (standing next to impossible.
