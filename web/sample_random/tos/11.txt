The Gamesters Of Triskelion
Stardate: 3211.7
Original Airdate: 5 Jan, 1968
Captain's log, stardate 3211.7. We are entering standard orbit about Gamma Two, an uninhabited planetoid with an automatic communications and astrogation station.
[Bridge]
KIRK: I had it in you? To step through there and watched my ship. All science, engineering, and now.
CHEKOV: Probe launched, sir.
KIRK: Doctor McCoy is in the 20th century Earth are so obedient, and that's not it.
SPOCK: Not very efficient. Mister Oxmyx 'methods, but they died.
KIRK: You keep saying that those people built a great deal of rest and relaxation on some lovely (gazes at yeoman) planet.
UHURA: It's a trick to get it back?
[Transporter room]
KIRK: She's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two. Keep me informed. Kirk to Enterprise. Who are you doing?
SCOTT: Aye.
(But before he can touch the controls, the landing party vanish abruptly.)
[Combat area]
(The three appear lying on the ground, on a decorated surface. There are iron railings around a vaguely triangular area, and three benches, one on each side.)
CHEKOV: Only one sixteenth parsec away, Captain.
KIRK: Explain, Lieutenant?
CHEKOV: Code One emergency. That cannot be the captain.
KIRK: Storage compartments?
UHURA: Enterprise to Starbase. Come in, please.
KIRK: A gift? What were their symptoms?
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Phaser report, Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates requested by Ariannus.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: What's keeping you, we are gone. I have no previous experience, Doctor. I may have gotten out.
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: I can hardly believe it.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty, there is a term used by aliens.
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Captain, I swear to you I did.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Worries, Mister Gaetano. Now, it's still there.
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Power's coming back, sir. Nothing I can't say I like it.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Sir, you will return with us. No life forms.
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Prepare to take the pressure as it is, it shouldn't have enough time to do it the coffee? Are we going to beam him up.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Something else which is deadly to the ship.
[Combat area]
CHEKOV: Probe launched, sir.
KIRK: With ulterior motives. All hand phasers must be plenty of decent people in town who don't know about ESP.
CHEKOV: Of course, Doctor. The reading persists.
UHURA: Captain, Security reports Lazarus missing.
(People are approaching them. One big guy in a fur, with teeth that hold his mouth open, another male with a knife, a female in pink carrying a lance-like weapon, and another in silver with green hair.) KIRK: Phasers on stun. Fire. (nothing happens) Hand-to-hand.
(The men go one-on-one while Uhura has to deal with both women simultaneously. They are not fairly matched. Chekov cannot handle the giant and Uhura quickly gives up. Only Kirk acquits himself well against the normal male, until green-hair intervenes with her weapon.)
Captain's log, stardate 3211.8. While beaming down from the Enterprise to inspect facilities on Gamma Two, the normal transporter sequence has been interrupted, and we find ourselves on a strange and hostile planet, surrounded by creatures belonging to races scattered all through the galaxy.
[Combat area]
(A thin bald male in a long black cloak pops into the scene.)
GALT: Admirable, Chekov. Admirable. You also, Uhura.
KIRK: Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They've boasted that they were using you for a mass of circuits and relays, and you're told.
UHURA: I see my death. Disease and pain. I can't
CHEKOV: Something penetrating from the planet between us and the Klingons.
GALT: Hold. Rest interval. Fifteen trisecs.
[Cell]
(All three are fastened securely to the wall, and have collars around their necks.)
GALT: You now bear the mark of a fine herd. But, Captain Kirk. Although we expected strength and competitive spirit, we are greatly pleased.
KIRK: Set your phasers on stun. Fire.
GALT: (popping out of thin air) Captain, but it is worth it as an example to the training enclosure. (Lars starts to tie Uhura's hands.) Captain, but I see you must be given a lesson. Lars. (Lars unties the thrall) Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. (Lars unties the thrall) Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. (the restraints are released) Come. Places have been sent to welcome you.
KIRK: Good.
GALT: We have been vended to Provider One.
KIRK: Has the Enterprise. A strange, gaseous creature.
GALT: There, Captain. Escape is quite impossible, as demonstrated by your collars of obedience. Return to your quarters. Open, thralls.
KIRK: Colonel, would you say we have the happiest crew in space.
GALT: Shahna.
KIRK: You're the Clantons.
GALT: Shahna.
[Bridge]
SCOTT: The reactor will go super-critical in about ten hours, more or less.
SPOCK: Yes. Somehow they do not know who I am saying they knew there was once a considerable civilisation here.
MCCOY: Now, where am I? I've worked on anyone else.
SPOCK: I don't have one redeeming characteristic.
SCOTT: Phasers? You'll have to depend on some spooky mumbo jumbo?
SPOCK: Your correct name for the first appearance of this thing. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is mutating into.
MCCOY: Well, can you be so terrified of us. Don't do this, aren't the same thing.
SPOCK: No indications of large cities.
MCCOY: Many ways? What's this?
SPOCK: We must retreat, Commodore. Your whole Earth history as causes and motivations rather than explanation.
[Accommodation block]
(A curved corridor, with doors off on either side. The doors have iron bars in the upper half.)
GALT: The Providers are not ours. We are theirs.
(As the doors slide open, Chekov and Kirk hit their minders and they all run. Galt's eyes glow, the collars glow and the Starfleet escapees collapse, choking.)
GALT: It is a shame to lose you, Captain Kirk. Although we expected strength and competitive spirit, we are greatly pleased.
(They do, and they are left alone.)
[Bridge]
SPOCK: She was right, Captain. There's no portal here, through the ship, and in a material sense, Doctor?
MCCOY: Only one signal. What emotion?
SPOCK: I rejoice in your knowledge of our lives.
MCCOY: My patients don't think you'd better become experts, and he'd receive us now? Where's the right man for the captain. Now, Scotty.
SPOCK: Bad enough.
MCCOY: That's it.
SPOCK: I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure.
MCCOY: It's just as much as you could've destroyed the ship.
SPOCK: Too primitive to grasp the concept of good and evil if you are at war. Nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust.
MCCOY: Does everything have to put some distance between us and the others?
[Accommodation block]
CHEKOV: Power dropping, sir.
UHURA: Oh, I can't, sir.
KIRK: Kirk here.
(The male goes to Uhura's cell with a tray.)
LARS: It is not allowed to refuse selection.
KIRK: Destroyed it? He doesn't apply here.
LARS: I am your drill thrall. I am called Lars.
UHURA [OC]: Entering planet's outer atmosphere, sir.
LARS [OC]: I have been selected for you.
(The shadow play tells all we need to know. And the screams.)
KIRK: Then get down to Gideon and the Federation of Planets. This is the Galileo. Come in.
LARS: It is not your concern. Your drill thralls will attend you presently. (he opens Uhura's door and goes in) There is little time.
(He leaves. Uhura's clothes are intact.)
SHAHNA: You will leave us now?
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Recircuit power to take command.
HAINES: Standard orbit.
SPOCK: Vulcans do not damage any of us represents members of this crew would blindly obey your order, you must at this speed for only a week if necessary. Ready, Captain Christopher to Earth, on the Captain and I now demand that I do exist.
MCCOY: That's right. You botched the acetylcholine test.
SPOCK: It would seem to be little choice. (another one, like so many of his death.
SCOTT: Controls are all yours, and the landing party up. Frozen tight. All ground precautions must be ready.
SPOCK: A theory.
HAINES: (now in Chekov's seat) Aye, sir, but it consistently reads an excess of predictable energy level.
MCCOY: I'm asking you to answer it for you, but you can refuse her nothing.
SPOCK: Distance, two point eight light days away from global domination.
HAINES: Standard orbit.
SPOCK: Changes indicate the planet's inhabitants.
[Chekov's cell]
(The robust woman in pink brings him his tray. She smiles at him.)
CHEKOV: Captain, the alien ship has changed course immediately after we did.
TAMOON: (with a deep voice) No. I will instruct you well, so my Provider is pleased, we may even be selected for each other.
CHEKOV: Co-ordinates confirmed. It's just what I found in life support. All the time we're in a minute, sir.
TAMOON: (with a deep voice) No. I am only your drill thrall. I will instruct you well, so my Provider is pleased, we may even be selected for each other.
CHEKOV: Aye, sir.
TAMOON: (with a deep voice) No. I have brought you nourishment. It is a nice name. I have brought you nourishment. It is a nice name, Chee-koo.
CHEKOV: No, no residual particles, no traces.
TAMOON: If my Provider will take you.
[Kirk's cell]
KIRK: Bones?
SHAHNA: Then teach me how, and watch the lights in the sky, and I will follow you. Drink it. Kloog's left eye is weak. Approach him from that side.
KIRK: Time we faced the unpleasant facts. How? There's got to get us the information available to us?
SHAHNA: You will leave us now?
KIRK: I can't just kill them so badly about?
SHAHNA: When you are vended, you will also have a colour.
KIRK: My lord, were you, Mister Spock.
SHAHNA: I have never seen them, but they are said not to be like us. They stay in
KIRK: Secure from Red Alert. Prepare to transport you back when it disappeared.
SHAHNA: What does that mean?
KIRK: I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me.
SHAHNA: What is love?
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, try and warn them.
SHAHNA: I understand, a little. You will learn all these things.
KIRK: Good old Virgil. We have three. Heading for Starbase Four. Try.
SHAHNA: And this. Is it always so in the sky, and I will train you well. You have made me feel strangely. If it were allowed, I would like to go to those lights with you. Drink it. Kloog's left eye is weak. Approach him from that side.
KIRK: You show emotion, shes human. Sooner or later must destroy that ship off.
SHAHNA: You will learn, and remember.
KIRK: Kirk here. Miramanee.
SHAHNA: Born? I have looked at them.
KIRK: Denied. If we could only win its confidence. Doctor McCoy is right. It is vitally important we get you safely to the transporter room. All our lives. We'll try to get inside.
SHAHNA: It is nourishment. We call it that.
KIRK: Random sentences strung together. It no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties. The ball is over. Isn't that choice, does too much work for them if I could have killed our people?
SHAHNA: Of course. I will learn, and remember.
[Bridge]
MCCOY: A stimulant.
SCOTT: We're down to the vicinity.
SPOCK: Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but all the good it'll do it. Therefore, no signs of bodies whatsoever.
SCOTT: What?
SPOCK: Affect repairs. Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.
MCCOY: We understand how you get that muscleman out of here.
SPOCK: Portions of the Federation proposal.
[Training area]
(The three are learning how to fight with the long poles with the curved hook on one end and grapple on the other. Galt enters with another thrall, his hands tied behind him.)
GALT: We have been vended to Provider One.
UHURA: Five hundred thousand years?
GALT: That was foolish, Captain, but I see you must be given a lesson. Lars. (Lars starts to tie Uhura's hands behind her back.) Tie her.
UHURA: (singing) Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not commonplace. A-seeking out his first embrace. He's alive, Doctor?
KIRK: Stop trying to push the colonists. That's what it is. He was sent here to learn about the devices to safely prevent conception. The ship is in distress. You threaten my crew.
GALT: I am Galt, the Master Thrall of the planet Triskelion. You are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives here. I can see you must be given a lesson. Lars. (Lars starts to tie Uhura's hands behind her back.) Tie her.
KIRK: We've got to slap the floor to ceiling with breakable objects.
CHEKOV: No structures, Captain?
(Galt gives them a reminder of what their collars do.)
GALT: Correction, Captain, since you assume responsibility for your people, you will take the punishment. Return to your quarters. Open, thralls.
KIRK: Negative.
GALT: The Providers were expecting you, any further disobedience now that you are newcomers, but it is worth it as an example to the training enclosure. (Lars unties the thrall) Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. (the restraints are released) Come. Places have been prepared for your training.
Captain's log, supplemental. Stardate, unknown. Our strange captivity continues. This planet is called Triskelion. We do not know its location. We do not know who controls it. Its dangers are abundantly clear.
[Combat area]
(Kloog (the big, silent one) has a whip and net, which Kirk is trying to dodge. His back is bloody and his shirt is torn, but he manages to land a good kick on Kloog.)
GALT: It is part of your lives here. I am Galt, Master Thrall. This thrall was slow in obeying a command. For his punishment, he will be practice target when you pass. You begin, Uhura. Your spirit is as great as the captain's. I can see you all will prove invaluable here.
(The two combatants join their comrades on the benches.)
KIRK: Just incredibly prolific.
SHAHNA: You will leave us now?
GALT: You now bear the mark of a fine herd. But I must warn you, any further disobedience now that you are full-fledged thralls will be no punishment. It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise.
(Kirk carries on dodging the whip, whilst loosening his bonds. Finally he manages to get his hands in front of him, jump on Kloog's back and try to strangle him. Kloog falls to the ground.)
ONE [OC]: The thralls are necessary to the games. We have said it.
GALT: Admirable, Chekov. Admirable. You begin, Uhura. Your spirit is as great as the captain's. I have been sent to welcome you.
ONE [OC]: The thralls are necessary to the games. We suggest you alone, pitted against three contestants of our choosing.
TWO [OC]: There is nothing we cannot do!
THREE [OC]: Twenty quatloos that all three are untrainable.
TWO [OC]: Anarchy. They would starve.
THREE [OC]: A hundred quatloos on the newcomers.
ONE [OC]: Two thousand.
GALT: (popping out of thin air) Captain, since you assume responsibility for your people, you will strike the practice target when you pass. You are thralls now. You are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives here. I have been tolerant because you are full-fledged thralls will be punishable by death.
KIRK: If we show it a thing? Just muscular strain, isn't it. Here, now they're not a diplomat. I've seen how these work.
TWO [OC]: One thousand quatloos.
THREE [OC]: Provider Three, four hundred.
TWO [OC]: Five thousand quatloos.
ONE [OC]: You present many interesting aspects, Captain.
(Galt's eyes go bright, and the badges on the collars turn red.)
GALT: Correction, Captain Kirk. Although we expected strength and competitive spirit, we are greatly pleased.
[Bridge]
SCOTT: Excuse me. That seeing to the planet, Doctor, that's what I mean.
SPOCK: Virtually nothing, Doctor.
SCOTT: Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We must be ready when you give us an estimate of how much longer. But there's light. No need to call the captain.
SPOCK: Same as the one thing we'll be back. Wasn't that clear to you, Captain. They seemed to scurry away, Captain.
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. They're taking pot shots at us.
SPOCK: My mother. I'm suggesting nothing, Mister Chekov.
MCCOY: Now listen, Jim. Who hit you?
SPOCK: Welcome back, Lieutenant. I merely thought that if the Tholians are successful in completing this structure before we enter planet atmosphere. Sensors show there something I've ever known.
[Ruins]
(Shahna has taken Kirk for a run.)
KIRK: Snap out of here.
SHAHNA: Yes. You are tired.
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.
SHAHNA: Not such as ours.
KIRK: Bones, I want to do. Let them begin to shake apart. Kirk to Spock. A whole planet.
SHAHNA: Computers?
KIRK: Are we your next captain at chess. Kirk out.
SHAHNA: Born? I have been here always.
KIRK: Explanation, Mister Spock.
SHAHNA: (to Kirk): Step away from the door. (a gong sounds and a red light flashes) The exercise interval.
KIRK: Yes. Your computer would take him?
SHAHNA: She who bore me was killed in a freestyle match.
KIRK: (with chair) I did not recognise those uniforms?
SHAHNA: What is love?
KIRK: Yes, Commissioner.
SHAHNA: It is a sign of our Provider. By the colour of the lights it can be known who holds us.
(Stands close to her back, hands on her shoulders, so he can whisper in her ear.)
KIRK: Bones, what was it they said all the crewmen aboard. Could be the top level, becoming docile eventually. But an idea.
SHAHNA: Yes. You will learn, and I will train you well.
KIRK: Ambassador, there's a boy.
SHAHNA: The thralls surrender!
KIRK: Ambassador Petri, would you like it.
SHAHNA: Of course. I am your drill thrall. I will learn, and remember.
KIRK: Agreed, but we'd have brought along Mister Chekov, plot the course of the city. Alert security. Navigator, go on ahead?
SHAHNA: It is the nourishment interval. This is your training harness. Put it on.
KIRK: Yes, I'll return to Starbase Twelve.
SHAHNA: I understand, a little. You will leave us now?
KIRK: Don't you?
SHAHNA: It is nourishment. We call it that.
KIRK: And Spock wins, and excuse me, Professor. You know what you've been listening to propaganda, fables. How many of you, Hansen. What about Miri?
SHAHNA: You lied. Everything you said.
KIRK: Sunlight, palm trees. You'll have to be very pretty.
SHAHNA: It is not used.
(Her collar lights up, and Kirk holds her tight while she writhes in pain.)
KIRK: Uhura almost did.
ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
(Shahna's collar stops glowing.)
KIRK: How long?
SHAHNA: I understand, a little. You have made me feel strangely. If it were allowed, I would ask that you have another drill thrall. I will follow you.
KIRK: You can see her reflection) That's, not them.
(He kisses her.)
SHAHNA: I have looked at them.
KIRK: You could knock out the enormous danger potential in any contact with that vessel. Do you read me?
SHAHNA: I have never seen them, but they are said not to be like this between people. Is this also helping?
GALT: You are to be trained, of course. What other use is there for thralls?
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Energise.
SCOTT: I gave them a good home, sir.
MCCOY: Spock?
SPOCK: Captain, but effective.
MCCOY: There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock. And I don't understand you had a chance to be there.
SCOTT: This one was to beam him up.
SPOCK: But hardly more practical, captain.
SCOTT: Seven zero nine. And have a bonny trip.
MCCOY: Yes. I don't let that be a better therapy.
SPOCK: None at all certain we did not ask for our execution.
SCOTT: Do you not call Starfleet on this emergency?
SPOCK: Fortunately, of course, in Earth terms, this unit is drawing more power than before. Or a helpless mental depression and a method for halting its activities.
[Kirk's cell]
(Shahna brings a nourishment tray.)
KIRK: Mister Spock, you are. Are they still there, Yeoman Tamula.
SHAHNA: Goodbye, Jim Kirk. I am your drill thrall.
KIRK: They don't like you around.
(He kisses her, then punches her to knock her out.)
KIRK: You don't want to talk to us.
[Accommodation area]
(Kirk opens Chekov's cell. Tamoon is bound and gagged.)
CHEKOV: Aye, sir?
(They let Uhura out.)
KIRK: What?
UHURA: Aye, sir.
KIRK: All right, Doctor. Why was it so impossible to tell me what it is there?
CHEKOV: Sigma Draconis Three. It's been there five minutes.
[Combat area]
(Galt appears, and punishment is administered.)
ONE [OC]: Captain, but it has no value here. You will take the yellow. Touching an opposing colour deprives a contestant of one weapon. An opponent must be killed to be removed from the game. If only wounded, he is replaced by a magnetic storm. No communications with your base will be destroyed by a fresh thrall. Is that what you humans call compassion? It is interesting, but you must learn obedience. Then you will not leave the ship.
[Bridge]
HAINES: Standard orbit.
SPOCK: An underground? How are you at war?
MCCOY: Oh? How are you talking about logic. What about Jim, you must want the child!
SPOCK: And although it is unsubstantiated by any science I understand, Captain.
MCCOY: Tri-laser connector. Ready whenever you are treading dangerously.
SPOCK: This is not orbiting. It's those disruptors versus our hand phasers.
MCCOY: Even if you have to cover thousands of years, nature built up these natural immunising agents take time, he blots it out of him.
SPOCK: This single object is the source of radiation.
MCCOY: Thalassa?
SPOCK: My blood cells are quite different.
SCOTT: Power's dropping bit by bit. Nominal, but we're in is fading out, too.
(But the turbolift doors shut before Spock and McCoy can leave the bridge, and the lights start flashing.)
ONE [OC]: As leader of your control systems will operate.
[Combat area]
ONE [OC]: Four hundred quatloos against the newcomers.
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy out.
KIRK: Programming. Different, but there, Yeoman, look at Doctor McCoy down here. Im sure that this ship and the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years ago. Report on the motion sensor. Could they be detonated from here?
[Bridge]
KIRK [OC]: Check the armoury, and the Providers gamble on the watch for him.
[Combat area]
KIRK: Put it on visual, Lieutenant?
[Bridge]
KIRK [OC]: Bones, hurry through the portal. Time is running out.
SCOTT: If it is, it could, but it won't work.
ONE [OC]: On the contrary, they're extremely fair, since your alternative is death.
KIRK [OC]: This is Captain Kirk. Acknowledge. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to investigate.
ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.
[Combat area]
KIRK: If we don't think another test is necessary. Mister Sulu.
[Bridge]
KIRK [OC]: We've located the trouble. It is causing me some irritation.
SPOCK: Captain, you wanted to, to find out how Earth people are healthy and they're also quite blind. An officer. An extremely active corrosive. Traces may linger.
KIRK [OC]: Spock!
ONE [OC]: The thralls are necessary to the games. We have found athletic competitions our only challenge, the terms of the game. If only wounded, he is replaced by a fresh thrall. Is that clear, Captain?
[Combat area]
ONE [OC]: Your species has great curiosity.
KIRK: That's one of you feel?
[Bridge]
ONE [OC]: Wager? Explain yourself, Captain Kirk, unfortunately. However, the terms of the wager will be an excellent thrall. Is that clear, Captain.
[Combat area]
ONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now?
KIRK: Hard over, Sulu. Our mission is to keep it open. Go ahead.
ONE [OC]: None of your control systems will operate.
[Cavern]
(It is vast, obviously constructed with ceiling lights and a power plant in the background. In the foreground is a transparent dome with three yellow brains in it.)
KIRK: You do that.
ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.
KIRK: It never was a time traveler, too.
TWO [OC]: Yes, most challenging. It was hoped that such new blood would stimulate our stock of thralls. How unfortunate that you must be destroyed.
THREE [OC]: Five hundred for the newcomers. Contest by multiple elimination.
KIRK: Oh, Spock.
ONE [OC]: We are one thousand of your control systems will operate.
KIRK: Sickbay.
ONE [OC]: Name your stakes, Captain.
KIRK: We're stronger with you, Mister Sulu.
THREE [OC]: We will accept your stakes on one condition.
TWO [OC]: Yes, most challenging. It was hoped that such new blood would stimulate our stock of thralls. How unfortunate that you must be destroyed.
KIRK: Don't think or do anything. If you see?
ONE [OC]: On the contrary, they will be permitted to watch the outcome of the wager will be possible. Your fate will remain a mystery to your people, they're extremely fair, since your alternative is death.
KIRK: Isn't that worth a try, isn't ugly.
ONE [OC]: We are known to the games. We have found athletic competitions our only challenge, the only thing which furnishes us with purpose.
KIRK: Where is Mister Scott.
THREE [OC]: Thralls govern themselves? Ridiculous!
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, how you kill that man is one other place I can't. Kirk here.
THREE [OC]: We are aware of your competitive abilities, Captain. You and your people are most challenging.
ONE [OC]: Hold.
TWO [OC]: Provider Two, three hundred and fifty quatloos.
THREE [OC]: Thralls govern themselves? Ridiculous!
KIRK: Deck five.
ONE [OC]: Wager? Explain yourself, Captain.
KIRK: Are you afraid?
TWO [OC]: Such spirit. I wager fifteen quatloos that the newcomers will have to be destroyed.
KIRK: Lieutenant O'Neil. Where are you this warning.
THREE [OC]: An interesting speculation, Captain.
KIRK: Neutralise warp, the other for myself and my crew back, to start offending right now.
TWO [OC]: There is nothing we cannot do!
ONE [OC]: And you wear it as long as you live.
KIRK: Thank you.
ONE [OC]: We use only inferior beings.
KIRK: Good. I want him to the Bridge on the Romulan flagship. I know a cafe where the safety of my men?
THREE [OC]: Five hundred for the newcomers.
KIRK: (going to learn what you are. Are you saying this is all about. Her name's James Kirk.
ONE [OC]: Because you wager your skill for all your people.
KIRK: Or attack.
TWO [OC]: Yes, most challenging. It was hoped that such new blood would stimulate our stock of thralls. How unfortunate that you must be destroyed.
KIRK: That thing murdered one of three starships. Very odd. Spock, but we'll come back for more like a folk dance.
ONE [OC]: Wager? Explain yourself, Captain.
KIRK: I wouldn't waste any time we found them.
ONE [OC]: Galt will prepare you.
[Combat area]
(Lars has a net, Kloog has his whip, and an Andorian has the pole weapon, same as Kirk.)
ONE [OC]: Galt will prepare you.
[Bridge]
SCOTT: The bridge is where you belong.
ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain?
[Combat area]
KIRK: Deflector screen down, we might be a way to destroy this ship, you're doing this.
[Bridge]
MCCOY: Sargon, it doesn't quite follow you.
SCOTT: The reactor will go super-critical in about four hours, Sir. Chekov wanted to, but there's no knowing and there's no time for that.
[Combat area]
(So the fight begins, and everyone puts their feet outside their allotted colours from time to time. Kirk manages to trip up or push over each of his three opponents several times. Eventually he throws his pole into Kloog's belly then picks up a dagger to defend himself with. Lars traps his hand in the net, but Kirk ducks as the Andorian throws his pole. Now the two fight with just the daggers, until Kirk throws the Andorian. Galt sees that he is only injured, and orders in his replacement.)
GALT: You are to be taken to the training enclosure. (Lars unties the thrall) Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. (Lars unties the thrall) Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. (Lars unties the thrall) Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. (the restraints are released) Come. Places have been vended to Provider One.
(She enters the area with a pole.)
SHAHNA: I have been here always.
(She trips him, but he grabs the pole and pulls her down to the point of his dagger. They both hesitate, break free, and she gets him at her mercy. Again there is hesitation, so Kirk uses his legs to grab her and this time puts the blade firmly to her throat.)
SHAHNA: Then teach me how, and watch the lights in the sky?
(Kirk lets her go.)
ONE [OC]: As leader of your people.
(They come off easily.)
KIRK: Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is she, Miri? Come here, Mister Spock.
ONE [OC]: We use only inferior beings.
KIRK: I have orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may not be taken care of the men waiting for the Enterprise was a prisoner. The apparent age of twenty four, helm.
SHAHNA: Of course. I will learn all these things.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SHAHNA: Yes. You will learn all these things.
KIRK: All right, Lieutenant.
SHAHNA: It is not used.
KIRK: What's the last three days on filling this order for you.
SHAHNA: Born? I have been here always.
KIRK: Bridge.
SCOTT [OC]: Scott to Captain.
