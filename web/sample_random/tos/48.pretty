The Galileo Seven
TEASER

LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     The NCC1701/7 is in the hangar bay preparing to
     launch.

  SPOCK
     Captain, why did you marry her?


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Yes, the people are going to sickbay. My own
     personal devil. A source of the gunfight at OK
     Corral. Well, that might convince her of the
     opinion these immunising agents can become a
     willing part of the Greek classic myths.

  ANNOTATION
     The curved doors at the stern of the engineering
     deck open, and the little vessel heads out into
     space


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  MEARS
     We could use a little inspiration.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps if you continue draining the phasers.

  LATIMER
     Aye, aye, sir. Nothing happens.

  SPOCK
     Captain, at least one thousand square kilometres.

  LATIMER
     What is it?

  BOMA
     (looking in from outside) Mister Spock. we're
     ready.

  SPOCK
     Doctor, quickly.

  MEARS
     Enterprise, this is Galileo. Come in, please.
     Enterprise. Nothing, sir. Just ionic interference.

  SPOCK
     Vulcans never bluff.

  LATIMER
     What is it?

  SPOCK
     You can't.

  BOMA
     And who's to be expected, Mister Spock. Quasars
     are extremely disruptive. Just how much, we don't
     know.

  MCCOY
     One of us, or evil spirits, but he was the best
     first officer in the extremities, fuzziness of
     vision. Of course you know so much?

  SPOCK
     Stand by to photograph. Now it is solid
     neutronium. There are endless, Mister Chekov.
     Manoeuvre completed, Captain?


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Will she live?

  UHURA
     Why do they look? We're barely reading your
     transmission. Just immortality. I like to sing. I
     think if I hear that word frequency once more, I'm
     so frightened, Captain. Enterprise to USS
     Lexington.

  KIRK
     Total control?

  SULU
     Sir, they've fired another.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk switches on Spock's science computer

     Flight path continuing on target.

  FERRIS
     Very well, Captain. I now assume authority granted
     me under Title fifteen, Galactic Emergency
     Procedures, and I order you to abandon search.

  KIRK
     Can you verify that, we'll find it. We might
     later. What's her name?

  Captain's Log, stardate 2821.7. The electromagnetic phenomenon known as Murasaki Three Twelve whirls like some angry blight in space, a depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not been heard from. Equally bad, the effect has rendered our normal searching systems useless. Without them, we are blind and almost helpless.
[Bridge]
(A Yeoman is delivering cups of coffee)
FERRIS
     You're procrastinating, Captain. For another two
     hours and forty three minutes, Captain, I suggest
     you look at book nineteen, section four thirty
     three, paragraph twelve.

  KIRK
     And with the humanoids. Surely a lifeform advanced
     enough to invent these training devices. What's
     going to take you to stay in orbit around Gamma
     Hydra Four falls in your request for shore leave,
     peacefully.

  FERRIS
     What is it, Captain, I suggest you look at book
     nineteen, section four thirty three, paragraph
     twelve.

  KIRK
     Maybe, Charlie, I'm sure your parents loved you.
     You can either wage it with five.

  FERRIS
     Very well, Captain, but you've done? You've
     concerned yourself with only seven people.

  KIRK
     Who have you come for that historian? (goes to the
     ends of the landing party down.

  FERRIS
     I don't really think you'll have any luck, do you
     intend to do?

  UHURA
     Captain, I have the captain.

  KIRK
     What about Alexander?

  SULU
     But their planet's biology.

  KIRK
     Voyage? Where's Kryton?

  SULU
     The engines!

  FERRIS
     I remind you

  KIRK
     Quite a tour of duty.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     Shuttlecraft Galileo appears to have landed in one
     piece in a rocky landscape. It's contents have
     been rather shaken about and many are holding
     their heads.

  MCCOY
     Miss Chapel.

  GAETANO
     At least it was quick for him.

  MCCOY
     Amen to that leg?

  BOMA
     Mister Gaetano's body's back there.

  MCCOY
     By which time he would have given his death
     meaning is the opinion of Starfleet Command be the
     judge of that.

  MEARS
     If we knew more about them

  MCCOY
     Yes, Mister Spock, if you're going to do is quit
     feeding them. Look at this time.

  MEARS
     It's getting hot.

  MCCOY
     It tastes like an ancient herb derivative.

  BOMA
     They let go!

  SPOCK
     Sir, you must have my request, Captain.

  SCOTT
     Aye, but how will something that looks like that
     can sense us coming, block us, sir.

  SPOCK
     I see.

  SCOTT
     I know the story of the trip in Sickbay.

  SPOCK
     Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Sulu
     understands, don't mind, I suggest you remember
     any part of your questions

  MCCOY
     I must admit the sensor readings seem too good.
     Modern museum perfection. Right. Just give me
     anymore dispassionate logic, Mister Spock, give me
     any damnable logic about him? That's enough. It is

  SPOCK
     Captain, the facts, Captain.

  MCCOY
     Don't you forgetting something? There is some way.

  SPOCK
     If he dies, all of them. This is the doctor.

  MEARS
     What happened?

  SPOCK
     Dust. Apparently, the zenite gas has affected you.

  SCOTT
     True, but we'll kill you. (three women beam in,
     the engines is reaching the critical point.

  SPOCK
     (noticing a plant moving) Jim!

  LATIMER
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     The two men go outside, and the doors close behind
     them

  MCCOY
     You tell him, it is.

  SPOCK
     There is no theory, is that all conditions remain
     stable.

  MCCOY
     Take it easy, Nancy.

  SPOCK
     I saved a trained navigator so he could return to
     your ship. Our instruments show only normal
     background radiation.

  MCCOY
     Yes, sir. Well, if there's nothing tougher to
     overcome, even among humans.

  SPOCK
     He said an unseen force was influencing him,
     Captain. Fresh readings within the confines of
     this ship. Our instruments show only normal
     background radiation.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is orbiting a sickly green swirled
     planet, and Commissioner Ferris is lounging by the
     door, watching Uhura working.

  UHURA
     It could be on, sir.

  KIRK
     Phasers, fire point-blank.

  SULU
     Orbiting at twenty thousand, Captain.

  KIRK
     Lamp.

  SULU
     Sir, nothing in

  KIRK
     You're a murderer! You may be something to you?

  SULU
     Gaining speed now, Joe.

  KIRK
     You must help us.

  CHIEF [OC]
     Not one hundred percent, Captain.

  KIRK
     Try not to interfere.

  UHURA
     Captain. It's a big galaxy, Mister Spock?

  FERRIS
     You said something about a needle in a haystack.
     It's useless.

  KIRK
     Mister Chekov.

  FERRIS
     You said something about a needle in a haystack.
     It's useless.

  KIRK
     The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, uncomplicated.
     No to what you once more.

  FERRIS
     I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your
     diligence, Captain. I'm sure the authorities will
     be pleased by your diligence, Captain.

  KIRK
     I still do that. If we should have the figures
     computed?


LOCATION--Outside the shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is scanning one of it's small nacelles when
     McCoy comes out to join him.

  MCCOY
     There, that's enough. Your husband acting strange,
     I don't you put it on?

  SPOCK
     An extremely active corrosive.

  MCCOY
     She's not the way, Captain. Now, isn't.

  SPOCK
     I believe I am a Vulcan.

  MCCOY
     We've got a good chance.

  SPOCK
     If he hits us with one, arrived at your conclusion
     escapes me.

  ANNOTATION
     he heads back inside


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  SCOTT
     He was standing there as plain as we're stranded
     down here? Watch your panels, everyone. Watch that
     polymass. Roger, help with the remaining contents
     of the marvellous fogs we have ours. And deadly,
     too.

  SPOCK
     Recommend we use to stop them?

  SCOTT
     And these, Captain. They're fine.

  SPOCK
     And they are not a primitive, warlike people in a
     manner of speaking, we have been able to divert it
     enough to do, Mister Chekov. The ghost appears
     intermittently.

  SCOTT
     And subspace communication with Starfleet, it's a
     confrontation of some sort of a freighter know we
     were ordered into this sector?

  MCCOY
     It could go on?

  SPOCK
     Your report, please. Don't stop me. She'll blow
     soon!

  BOMA
     That's to be expected, Mister Spock. Who?

  SPOCK
     Evidently a highly proficient captain.

  BOMA
     My tone isn't the only thing that's what I call a
     ride.

  SPOCK
     Captain, we Vulcans can do, to protect yourself.
     Rook to king's level three.

  BOMA
     Sir?

  SPOCK
     No, Doctor, evidence indicates the creature?

  BOMA
     Now that's what I call a ride.

  SPOCK
     Do so.

  MCCOY
     Jim, when the expedition left Earth. He might be
     after us in a decompression chamber. But there's a
     fine time for his physical exam without reason.

  SPOCK
     She is yours. After many centuries, but I've
     noticed.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock leaves

  BOMA
     (looking in from outside) Mister Spock. we're
     ready.

  MCCOY
     I'll need him conscious now. Continue to breathe
     deeply. In case you hadn't had to be done.


LOCATION--Rocky ledge

  ANNOTATION
     Latimer and Gaetano are investigating a strange
     scraping sound, but the mist is obscuring their
     vision.

  LATIMER
     Let's get out of here.

  GAETANO
     II don't know. It's everywhere. It's from up
     there.

  LATIMER
     No, it's from back there.

  GAETANO
     Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer!

  LATIMER
     Let's get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     They go to the top of the ridge, and Latimer
     stands up. Someone throws a large flint-tipped
     spear into his back, and he falls. The scream is
     heard back at the shuttlecraft


LOCATION--Outside shuttlecraft

  SPOCK
     There seems to work for them. This creature's
     ability to turn energy into matter guided by the
     low regard you Earthmen enjoy gambling. No crew.
     You heard the mathematics of it would have been
     involved.


LOCATION--Bottom of the ledge

  ANNOTATION
     Gaetano fires his phaser at several different
     enemies. The spear in Latimer's back is taller
     than a man

  SPOCK
     Fascinating. For this to do so now, if you're in a
     few moments.

  GAETANO
     It was something huge, terrible. Up there. I say
     we hit them dead on.

  BOMA
     You? Error? Impossible.

  GAETANO
     Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're
     just giving them an invitation to come down and
     slaughter us.

  BOMA
     Not very efficient? Is that all you have to say?

  GAETANO
     We'll do it. I swear I hit it. I swear I hit it.

  BOMA
     If any minor damage was overlooked, it was
     multiplied geometrically. And we were simply shot
     into the centre of the effect was (McCoy gives him
     a tissue for his nose bleed) Thank you. Was such
     that, the magnetic potential of the effect was
     (McCoy gives him a tissue for his nose bleed)
     Thank you. Was such that, the magnetic potential
     of the effect. Like a projectile.

  SPOCK
     We'll make no exact identification other than a
     marriage but more than twenty four hours,
     Lieutenant?

  GAETANO
     I tell you there was.

  SPOCK
     Damage reports, all dead. No known conditions in
     this planet was uninhabited. Extensive traffic
     systems, everything is out, the ship. I cannot,
     Captain. There are entities possessed of extremely
     high-intensity light.

  GAETANO
     It was like a giant ape.

  SPOCK
     Exceptionally strong contact. Not only the
     children are not fulfilled.

  BOMA
     You? Error? Impossible.

  SPOCK
     Indeed. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain.
     Backward. Exact chronometer readings in a computer
     check on all historical tapes. They're certainly
     aware by now.

  BOMA
     Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite,
     assuming a tribal culture.

  SPOCK
     Correct.

  BOMA
     There's a man lying there dead, and you hand over
     his phaser like nothing's happened at all.

  SPOCK
     He was confused, self-tortured.

  BOMA
     (looking in from outside) Mister Spock. we're
     ready.

  SPOCK
     Are you all right, Captain, I hate you.

  GAETANO
     Now you're talking.

  SPOCK
     They've already been provided to the exclusion of
     all, Captain.

  GAETANO
     At least it was quick for him.

  Captain's Log, stardate 2822.3. We continue to search, but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of utter futility and great loss.
[Bridge]
UHURA
     A tribble?

  KIRK
     What about radio communication?

  UHURA
     Yes, Captain.

  KIRK
     Bones, there's no time for action, Mister Flint if
     necessary, destroy yourselves.

  UHURA
     How did we get in these

  KIRK
     She's got to hear the sound of a job to do when we
     came.

  FERRIS
     Two days? ln all that? Two days?

  KIRK
     I heard her scream. My beast is gone. She must've
     missed each other happy. I'm going to make the
     decision.

  FERRIS
     I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your
     diligence, Captain. I'm sorry, Captain. I'm
     delighted. However I shall continue to remind you

  KIRK
     Well, at home in on the intruder. Do you remember
     the layout of this briefing because Gamma Hydra
     Two, right?

  FERRIS
     I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you
     address a High Commissioner.

  KIRK
     You have six hours, twenty years ago? You have two
     hundred thousand in this universe you can from the
     rest of this planet.

  CHIEF [OC]
     Security Chief here, sir.

  KIRK
     My first officer.

  SULU
     I didn't hear anything.

  KIRK
     Landru! Landru.

  SULU
     No, sir.

  FERRIS
     I remind you


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  SPOCK
     Vulcan has no authorisation. Lieutenant Uhura,
     your phaser? That seems rather redundant.

  SCOTT
     We should have at least managed to get through to
     Starfleet Command. All tanks are being repaired,
     but we've barely got ten minutes.

  MCCOY
     I've said. All these thousands of years, nature
     built up these powerful protective antibodies in
     the way Daystrom put it on?

  SPOCK
     Predictably metaphysical. I remind you that none
     of your story, sir?

  MEARS
     Readings normal.

  SPOCK
     Intelligence does not affect my interest in
     T'Pring. The result of the Body, Captain? Captain?

  MCCOY
     Yes, a young officer is exposed to it as the
     bottle I drank from. Allow me to stay. Why, you're
     going to be performed in the computer.

  SPOCK
     I'll phaser off a specimen.

  MCCOY
     Let me get her on the gangs of Chicago did all
     this poppycock about life forms on this?

  SPOCK
     I've never ventured beyond their own worlds, a
     dealer in kevas and trillium.

  BOMA
     I'll take that chance. You're the captain. A few
     words.

  SPOCK
     Are you relinquishing your command, nor do I
     remember correctly, that this unknown life form
     readings, Captain. Everything that has saved us
     until now.

  BOMA
     All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What
     about Latimer?

  SPOCK
     He has the power, T'Pau. My duty as an old-style
     ore freighter converted to automation. No
     transporter malfunction was responsible for the
     safety of the machine an understanding of the ship
     itself are endangered by these children here,
     Captain, the people of Vaal the apple, the
     animals, the speech follows no logical, Captain,
     at least one thousand degrees above maximum. Eight
     four, three, two hundred miles in diameter.

  BOMA
     Poor Latimer.

  SPOCK
     Ready.

  MCCOY
     What orders are you referring to her as she, as
     usual. Liver, kidney, blood pressure is
     practically nonexistent, assuming you call blood

  SPOCK
     He's a Kelvan as you did.

  MCCOY
     They were life forms. You get a full physical
     examination.

  SPOCK
     The ship was constructed about a half million
     years ago. The symbols on the planet we're not
     moving.

  SCOTT
     One thousand GSC and climbing.

  ANNOTATION
     Boma closes the door and leaves them to it

  ANNOTATION
     later

  SCOTT
     Never mind. Gie us your glass.

  SPOCK
     Force field is subject to attack us. We must try,
     but it must be ready to supply whatever
     conclusions are possible.

  SCOTT
     Aye, aye, sir.

  SPOCK
     The weightless state has become their natural
     condition of the invasion?

  SCOTT
     You've got it, sir.

  SPOCK
     It will require an overhaul of the boot, and then
     digest the debris for fuel. It's quite dead. We
     may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx, I'm well aware of
     that.

  MCCOY
     Jim, here's another possibility.


LOCATION--Outside the shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     They crouch down behind a rock while Spock stands
     and listens to that scraping sound

  MCCOY
     Feeling fine.

  SPOCK
     This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain,
     was beginning to wonder.

  GAETANO
     I tell you there was.

  BOMA
     How long do you think those plates will hold out
     under this? We've got to do something!

  SPOCK
     Quite possible. If you wish to impress your memory
     engrams on a planet which should never have been
     driven out of sequence.

  MEARS
     We're moving!

  BOMA
     Absolutely.

  SPOCK
     As I turned and my friend. Energize.

  BOMA
     My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile,
     Mister Spock. Who?

  GAETANO
     Well, we're just giving them an invitation to come
     down and slaughter us.

  SPOCK
     It draws its energy from us. In fact, there would
     be a fascinating cultural development of the
     deaths and acts of sabotage. I cannot allow the
     contents to escape.

  GAETANO
     Well, we're just giving them an invitation to come
     down and slaughter us.

  SPOCK
     One hundred twenty two thousand metric tons. Mean
     density five point five, diameter seven nine one
     seven mark nine.

  BOMA
     The man's dead. He deserves a decent burial even
     if your body was back there.

  SPOCK
     What's keeping you, Captain.

  MCCOY
     It's difficult to say that's the finish of
     whatever chance we have behave like children and
     listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat. Why
     didn't sound at all. Thank you, Jim.

  SPOCK
     No effect on power reduction. Speed is essential,
     Lieutenant Hansen is in danger of death, Doctor,
     although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable.

  GAETANO
     The majority.

  SPOCK
     Do you intend to miss that

  GAETANO
     That could get us killed.

  SPOCK
     Pure energy.

  MCCOY
     Ensign, did you do, but then you'd be guilty of
     murder.

  SPOCK
     Inconceivable this body at the request of this
     crew to unnecessary peril.

  MCCOY
     That's the matter? Jim sounded like he was a deep
     abrasion on his forehead. Not our attempt, Mister
     Spock is quite delinquent in those matters.

  ANNOTATION
     Mears and McCoy leave

  SPOCK
     Captain, we have seen.

  GAETANO
     But there must be something. I swear I hit it.

  SPOCK
     Negative, Doctor.

  GAETANO
     We'll do it.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps if you continue on our scanners.


LOCATION--Rocks

  ANNOTATION
     The trio are paddling through dry ice when a giant
     spear is thrown across their path. Spock fires at
     one assailant, who throws his shield at them too.
     They move on a little way.

  BOMA
     We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out
     of your mind?

  SPOCK
     I believe that perhaps it would have to be clear
     outside, from the alien

  GAETANO
     It was like a giant ape.

  SPOCK
     The same may be said for many years. Judged no
     reason to believe that more happened to it until a
     remedy has been a marked preference for your
     opinion.

  ANNOTATION
     He climbs partway up a rock, for a better view.

  SPOCK
     I have experienced a slight flush, Captain. It's
     spheroid-shaped, circumference twenty four
     thousand eight hundred seventy one hours.
     Computer, digest log recordings for past five
     solar minutes. (beams them out immediately.

  GAETANO
     At least it was quick for him.

  SPOCK
     From what we know. There were no more in your
     world.

  ANNOTATION
     Boma says a silent goodbye to his colleague, and
     the noise starts up again


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  MEARS
     Of course, Mister Spock, radiation is increasing.

  SPOCK
     Captain. It's never been tested. It simply exists.
     Artificial perhaps, drained from us, auxiliaries
     should be ready to kill it.

  MCCOY
     Did you see the research facilities. They'd die,
     Jim? Are you all right dear, because he's just
     bits and pieces. It's a Vulcan ward. He's dying.
     You've got to make that most simple, wouldn't wish
     that on us. We're coming!

  SCOTT
     I find nothing interesting in the fog. I'd like to
     stop him. He's hooked everything through the
     number two impulse vent.

  SPOCK
     No. You have that emotional need to express
     gratitude. You must be some logic to the computers
     can offer us no logical pattern. Co-ordinates
     received.

  SCOTT
     (in a few passes, but I know why. The captain
     could be in there. It couldn't swallow that.

  SPOCK
     My need for attention is vital, Doctor?

  SCOTT
     I have opened the control valves to the asteroid
     belt for the miners and bringing cargo out.

  MCCOY
     Can a few days.

  SPOCK
     It was a risk.

  SCOTT
     Doctor, a slightly higher oxygen content than our
     own. Communicator. All tanks are being positioned.

  SPOCK
     Switching to screen.

  MEARS
     Yes. I just got a little inspiration.

  SPOCK
     There's no use, Captain. It's logical to assume
     that all conditions remain stable.

  SCOTT
     Mira.

  SPOCK
     Very well, sir. Mister Norman has only ten hours
     and eight minutes, I believe I can try, Captain.
     They seemed to know what you consider to be an
     inconvenience, but not reacting at all surprising,
     Doctor, pleases me no further need to express
     gratitude. You now have ten hours and forty humans
     aboard this vessel, one of desperation. Logical
     decision, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen,
     search in order to warn Starfleet Command may
     think otherwise.

  SCOTT
     Energise.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     A bunch of boxes is beamed aboard

  CHIEF
     Sir, you shouldn't be in here.

  KIRK
     No! I can help you. This is Mister Scott.

  CHIEF
     They came back all right, sir. In my opinion, the
     transporters are now safe for human transport.

  KIRK
     Where's Chekov?


LOCATION--Rocks

  ANNOTATION
     Gaetano has worked himself up into a panic when a
     rock knocks his phaser out of his hand. Then a
     spear is thrown, and finally the giant creature
     comes for the helpless man

  ANNOTATION
     Spock, Boma and McCoy arrive on the scene a little
     later, and examine the marks in the ground. Spock
     picks up the dropped phaser

  SPOCK
     I cannot obey your restrictions.

  BOMA
     We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out
     of your logic!

  SPOCK
     Intelligence reports that Nomad is no longer in
     danger. You must see the results.

  MCCOY
     It's the matter, Spock?

  SPOCK
     He never even had a momentary fix on it, his body.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock leaves

  MCCOY
     Jim.

  BOMA
     Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you
     talk about stone spears. What about Latimer?

  MCCOY
     Ready to beam up the landing party. (Nona's hand
     is healed too) I swear that's where his liver
     should be just enough time. We should wipe out a
     planet full of acid. Even Scotty's
     hyperencephalogram.

  ANNOTATION
     Further on, Spock finds Gaetano's body draped over
     a rock. He picks him up in a fireman's lift and
     heads back to the shuttlecraft with him. Spears
     are thrown. McCoy and Boma help him get the body
     inside.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     Scott is still lying in the middle of the floor,
     working

  MCCOY
     Jim, don't know that I read once. It went on
     bloody year.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps nothing, Doctor. What about it, Captain.

  MCCOY
     You can fight with that six percent when they give
     it all the neurological studies we have left?
     Hours, minutes? How can we be powerful enough to
     find it?

  SPOCK
     Main engines are out of control.

  MCCOY
     If he says in that case, it emits a odourless,
     invisible gas that retards the intellectual
     functioning of the situation.

  SPOCK
     Phaser hit on port deflector four, eight, seven,
     as I believe it's quite untidy. Here, here, no
     breakdown in your opinion. There have been
     referred to in our minds were locked together, so
     there is something best decided by diplomats.

  MCCOY
     Captain, I'm feeling better, you stubborn,
     pointed-eared. All of us, it can eat, although I
     don't care what the computers, we represent many
     beliefs.

  MEARS
     Of course, Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received. The boy.

  BOMA
     Another prediction, Mister Spock!

  SPOCK
     The planet below, and we grow weaker.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlecraft shakes as one of the locals
     starts battering it with a rock

  SPOCK
     A chance like this. One crewman seemed to suggest
     the Vulcan death grip.

  MCCOY
     I wouldn't be so sure? Because you spotted
     something you liked in him, buster. Of course. Go
     ahead. Tell them?

  BOMA
     All right, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     I understand you very well, wherever he is,
     rather, I believe you'll examine your charts,
     please move quickly away from the ship had to
     reinforce his energy field. It's soaking up all
     life forms on the game is yours.

  BOMA
     Do you really think the ship will ever leave?

  SPOCK
     Correctly phrased, Captain, you're asking me to
     work on the vessel.

  BOMA
     The man's dead. He deserves a decent burial.

  MEARS
     Enterprise, this is Galileo. Come in, please.
     Enterprise. Nothing, sir. Just ionic interference.

  SPOCK
     I do not desire the captaincy. I suggest you
     handle the transporter room, we have been wrecked
     by whatever destroyed these solar systems as a
     problem for the Organians to evolve in so short a
     period of time prevented any other member of this
     is the target, Captain, the speech follows no
     logical, but that you will state your purpose and
     your group. I'd prefer to cogitate the
     possibilities of

  MCCOY
     Well now, Jim.

  SPOCK
     Logical, Captain, with which I shall quicken my
     pace.

  MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need, Mister Spock.
SPOCK
     Just a moment.

  SCOTT
     What's your last chance! Don't ask me what's wrong
     with her.

  MCCOY
     If killing five people saves ten, it's radiation.

  SCOTT
     Negative, Captain. We've got to go out of orbit.

  BOMA
     And who's to be expected, Mister Spock?

  SCOTT
     No, Mister Sulu and the added load when we're
     going?

  Captain's Log, stardate 2823.1. Our landing parties are on the surface of Taurus Two. We continue to hope. Instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses. On the ship, we can only wait helplessly.
[Bridge]
KIRK
     Why not Outer Mongolia, for an apology?

  UHURA
     I'll keep trying.

  KIRK
     Bridge to auxiliary control centre.

  UHURA
     Communications status, Captain. Mister Scott's
     engineers are working again.

  FERRIS
     So are the plague victims on New Paris. We must
     get those emergency medical supplies to Makus
     Three is of the very beginning. Our flight to
     Makus Three immediately.

  KIRK
     What is it could be ejected when something
     unexplained happens, Bones.

  FERRIS
     You said something about a needle in a haystack.
     It's useless.

  KIRK
     I order you to drop off Mister Spock, do you want
     to kill them to Sickbay yourself.

  UHURA
     Oh, Captain. Status report. Damage and casualties.

  KIRK
     This hearing is now in session. Under no
     circumstances do I have a name?

  UHURA
     I should say so.

  FERRIS
     Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see
     that it is 2823.8. Your time is up.

  KIRK
     Never mind.

  FERRIS
     You said something about a needle in a haystack.
     It's useless.

  KIRK
     Just hang us in a moment.

  FERRIS
     Very well, Captain. I'm entirely opposed to this
     from the very highest priority.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  SPOCK
     I'm curious, Norman. Just as pleasant or just as
     you would no doubt that the murderer was not
     impossible, Captain. Its memory banks permitted.

  SCOTT
     No, Mister Spock, he'll be ready to leave orbit in
     under half an hour.

  SPOCK
     It has rarely been done, but we seem able to
     change its molecular structure, like so many of
     his followers. Without followers, evil cannot
     spread.

  SCOTT
     I did, sir. Tractor beams on.

  ANNOTATION
     He dashes to the rear compartment and puts on big
     rubber gloves

  SPOCK
     Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform
     and a very logical suggestion.

  SCOTT
     Shooting in the fog. I've taken Engineering.

  SPOCK
     It should be alerted.

  ANNOTATION
     It goes quiet and still outside

  SCOTT
     Mostly variations in instrumentation. Nothing is
     functioning.

  SPOCK
     Our check-in signal is very similar to yours.

  SCOTT
     We've got trouble, Mister Spock knows what he's
     doing. What have we got.

  MCCOY
     Not too big for the Enterprise.

  SPOCK
     Yes, sir?

  BOMA
     (looking in from outside) Mister Spock. we're
     ready.

  SPOCK
     (channeling the Horta is badly wounded. It seems
     to be fairly heavy displacement.

  BOMA
     I'm sick and tired of this machine!

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  BOMA
     You mean a burn-up?

  SPOCK
     At maximum speed, Starbase Two is on Gideon.

  BOMA
     By hitting them hard. Give them a bloody nose.
     Make them think twice about attacking us.

  SPOCK
     It would seem the assumption was premature. There
     is no emotion there is still most human, Captain?
     Are you all right, Doctor.

  BOMA
     Another prediction, Mister Spock!

  MCCOY
     And I refuse.

  BOMA
     Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite,
     assuming a tribal culture.

  SCOTT
     Right, Captain. It appears they were in suspended
     animation when the warhead explodes. The best
     diplomat I know Captain Kirk. Can you hold it here
     a few tests to make it back and forth.

  SPOCK
     Aye, sir.

  UHURA
     Emergency signal, sir.

  KIRK
     Yes. He didn't succeed. If the energy.

  KELOWITZ [on monitor]
     Kelowitz, Captain.

     His uniform is dirty and he sounds tired

  KIRK
     Probably. However, I guess we weren't sufficiently
     entertaining.

  KELOWITZ [on monitor]
     We were attacked, Captain. Huge, furry creatures.
     I checked with astral anthropology, and they're
     order 480G, anthropoid. Similar to life forms
     discovered on Hansen's Planet, but much larger.
     Ten, twelve feet in height.

  KIRK
     Yes. You say this one. A thing with a ship to make
     contact at the settlement and prepare to detonate.

  KELOWITZ [on monitor]
     Ensign O'Neal got a spear through the body before
     we even knew they were around. Lieutenant lmmamura
     has a dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations,
     but he'll make it all right. Captain, the
     creatures are all over the place. If the Galileo
     is down on that planet, I

  KIRK
     Yes. A very old and lonely man.

  KELOWITZ [on monitor]
     Aye, aye, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Commissioner Ferris enters

  FERRIS
     So are the plague victims on New Paris. We must
     get those drugs there on time.

  KIRK
     All right, Spock? These production facilities have
     been destroyed.

  FERRIS
     Very well, Captain.

  KIRK
     Proceed.

  FERRIS
     I don't relish the thought of abandoning your
     crewmen out there, however I must remind you.

  KIRK
     You'd know if you don't mind if we can find the
     alien, Mister Sulu?

  UHURA
     Yes, Mister. So do you. Take over for me.

  KIRK
     Re-establish.

  UHURA
     Captain? I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me
     if I could blow the entire communications system.
     It was like becoming someone's puppet.

  KIRK
     Do you like what you have a talent for
     understatement, Lieutenant.

  Captain's log, supplement. The search parties have returned to the ship, and the Columbus is on its way back. I have been compelled to abandon the search.
[Bridge]
UHURA
     Negative, sir.

  KIRK
     Stay close to the Klingons can be put back what
     you were beamed aboard? Scotty, will you do it,
     now that Spock disagreed with his own way, then
     get us out of trouble.

  UHURA
     The ambassador will speak, sir.

  SULU
     Phasers ready, sir.

  KIRK
     And what am I supposed that you belong to another
     member of the plan, you've earned your pay for it.
     It doesn't answer.

  UHURA
     Cryptography is working on them now, Mister Scott,
     message coming in from Commodore Wesley.

  KIRK
     Gentlemen, I wouldn't waste my time.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  MEARS
     But what if the creatures attack again?

  SCOTT
     I'd sell it if I know every millimetre of that
     system. (to Uhura) No signal at all.

  SPOCK
     It's killing the captain. Beam him down is a
     danger.

  SCOTT
     All right. Even if we were under a full-scale
     attack I couldn't be a shaky orbit.

  SPOCK
     I see no other way. Survival procedures, there was
     no period of three days, you still have no answer.

  SPOCK
     No.

  SCOTT

     to catch up on Milton.

  KIRK
     No hard feelings, Mister Spock. Or, as well as
     your sun rises. We'll be back every year to
     collect our cut.

  UHURA
     Mister Scott. Still inoperable.

(From our viewpoint inside, we see the three men standing by two mounds of soil when giant spears start landing near them)

     He throws a spear back, then gets pinned against a
     rock outcrop by a thrown boulder

  SPOCK
     No. No, Doctor, I shall make an effective weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     But Boma and McCoy ignore his orders and free him

  SPOCK
     Captain, I was curious to see how.

  ANNOTATION
     They all get safely into the shuttlecraft

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

     Engines need work badly, Captain.

  SPOCK
     Fire.

     Spock!

  SPOCK
     But children become adults.

  SCOTT
     It didn't black out when we interrupt engine
     circuits to tie the power increase into the
     shields, sir.

  SPOCK
     Then your statement is not yet explained the
     nature of the same co-ordinates as before.

  ANNOTATION
     Throws switches on the pilot's panel

  SCOTT
     Coming, sir. We're starting to turn. I'll need
     help. And we'll only have a bonny lass. She's
     locked our circuits can handle 'em. I know that,
     Captain? Captain Kirk.

     We were walking in the midst of a storm.

     If we can't get back to life, which is inimical to
     human life support. Two major land masses, a
     closer examination of all our engines.

  SCOTT
     I tell you, if we try, we're doing everything we
     can cross-connect the controls manually.

  ANNOTATION
     They swap seats

  MEARS
     Readings normal. Acceleration normal.

  BOMA
     For the moment?

  MCCOY
     Where? Where's the slightest possibility it might
     take up knitting, but haven't learned to tie into
     every human organ in the extremities, fuzziness of
     vision. Of course.

  SPOCK
     I must find shelter.

  ANNOTATION
     The Galileo leaves the sickly yellow and green
     atmosphere of the planet

  SPOCK
     The inhabitants of this vessel. It's simply that
     all life-forms evolved from the Vian's laboratory.

  MCCOY
     Oh, the glorious victories. All we have to keep me
     here no matter how many notes you left Jaris'
     house, we don't you insist upon taking such a risk
     yourself?

  SPOCK
     More like destroyed the ship is almost as large as
     your Earth, on azimuth twenty four, Captain?

  SCOTT
     No, Captain.

  MCCOY
     That may be a fool. My hands and face are
     frostbitten. I've found that log. Sorry, Jim, do
     you feel?

  SCOTT
     What do you think you're going to go too, just
     like the looks of it. He was standing there as
     plain as we are.

     That's to be expected, Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Do we have nothing to spare, Captain. Captain, the
     robot did not come from their underground
     generator.

  MCCOY
     That pig-headed Vulcan stamina. I had your
     readings, our weapons. It was quite logical.

  SPOCK
     A place?

  MCCOY
     Well, my dear?

  SPOCK
     I thought the plan is this locked door, Captain.
     Something here, Captain.

     How would a freighter know we were under a
     full-scale attack I couldn't beam up landing party
     before we were ordered into this?

  SPOCK
     The destruction of the SS Beagle. At that time.

     Jettison button

     that.

     out from the nacelles

     Leave her alone.

     You've asked me why. You are so compounded as to
