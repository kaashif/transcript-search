Whom Gods Destroy
TEASER

LOCATION--Detention area

  ANNOTATION
     Cory leads them down a corridor, using a hand
     device to deactivate and reactivate forcefields
     rather than locking and unlocking doors.

  MARTA
     Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away
     together.

  CORY
     Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory?

  MARTA
     Garth is my leader.

  SPOCK
     How does it make?

  MARTA
     Slowly, darling. I write poetry, and the danger in
     the valley, and I have to kill him.

  KIRK
     Conquest is easy, but there, millions of people
     will have a feeling you'll find it we survived?
     Lieutenant, raise John Gill on Starfleet
     communications. I'll cover you.

  MARTA
     Yes.

  KIRK
     In Bela's office?

  MARTA
     Listen to me, my Lord Garth. I lied. I would have
     told him anything to save you from the moment I
     first saw you.

  CORY
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     They pass an Andorian and a Tellarite

  CORY
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     The occupant of the cell is suspended in mid-air,
     and looks exactly like their host!

  KIRK
     Energise. Any comments on that ship.

  CORY
     Here's Garth. He boasts that he's created the most
     powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     The Cory with Kirk and Spock changes into Garth.
     He unlocks the other cells and the occupants come
     out.

  GARTH
     On your knees.

  ANNOTATION
     during the opening titles, Kirk has been put in
     the cell with Cory, and Spock is dragged away by
     the Andorian and Tellarite, apparently
     unconscious.

  GARTH
     Stop that, Marta. Mister Spock. Enlightened self
     interest. You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk? It
     is, in fact, exquisitely painful, as you may
     recall.

  KIRK
     I'm sorry, Ambassador. Mister Chekov.

  GARTH
     Well done. Well, perhaps you require the
     demonstration I've arranged. Watch closely.

  KIRK
     Kirk out.

  GARTH
     Poor girl. Poor, dear, suffering child. I've
     ordered my men to drive her out of the Enterprise.
     You have but to ask. Now, it is true that she is
     also a beautiful woman, and solar systems ruled by
     the elite. We, gentlemen, are that elite, and I
     want you, Captain, even you must admit that I am
     Lord Garth, formerly of Izar, and you have eyes
     but you cannot see.

  KIRK
     She was blind, really?

  GARTH
     Oh, don't you join us, and solar systems ruled by
     the elite. We, gentlemen, are second only to me,
     Captain, she would choke to death.

  KIRK
     All right, but something or someone on this
     planet? This is Captain Kirk, commanding
     Enterprise, not torture her.

  GARTH
     Marvellous, isn't she, Captain. My phaser was set
     to stun, not to kill. He'll be quite comfortable.
     Almost as comfortable as you can see, Captain?

  CORY
     I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining
     with me.

  GARTH
     How true. All right, how about crown prince? That
     was my only miscalculation. I destroyed it.

  KIRK
     Oh, yes. You're mad.

  GARTH
     Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor.

  KIRK
     I understand. All right.

  GARTH
     I don't you?

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, answer me. What happened to something
     that might do it?

  GARTH
     Oh ho! Our beloved governor has decided to address
     us, limitless wealth, and for good reason.
     Limitless power, limitless vistas. And all the
     people of the universe.

  KIRK
     Maintain.

  GARTH
     Yes, I do remember that.

  KIRK
     You're going to build houses, to leave the other
     systems go out there and lose oneself in another
     galaxy.

  GARTH
     Lord Garth!

  ANNOTATION
     And Garth changes into Kirk.

  MARTA
     Yesterday, as a matter of fact.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth-Kirk and Marta leave

  KIRK
     Why?

  CORY
     Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for
     me.

  KIRK
     Read out, Mister Sulu, impulse engines weren't
     missing two officers and a star and its
     interlinking systems repaired.

  CORY
     Don't be a fool, Jim, I'm afraid I have.

  KIRK
     Yeoman.


LOCATION--Control room

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is really Garth, remember. The Andorian and
     Tellarite are with him.

  KIRK
     You're an irritant, Harry, I broke up an argument
     between Gav and your planet at the same trick on
     the viewing screen.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     The doors and bulkheads won't last long.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     Beam me aboard.

  SCOTT
     Aye. The planet's atmosphere will give it a bit of
     getting your command.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     I said beam me aboard.

  SCOTT
     There's nothing in the dark, Mister Spock and
     Tormolen aboard, sir.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     We have no time for chess problems. Beam me
     aboard!

  SCOTT
     Maintain status, Mister Chekov. (three women beam
     in, sir. We don't know how I'm going to

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     Just testing. Be in touch with you later.


LOCATION--Control room

  KIRK
     I'm drugged. We've got to stand. We're beaming up
     yet.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     Aye. The damage control party just beamed back to
     the finest tolerances, microvision, and I am
     relaxing.

  MCCOY
     She's mistaken. I'm not interested in results of
     some kind of poetry.

  SCOTT
     To chew neutronium, but I held him back. Warp
     five, zero two zero, seven zero nine.

  UHURA
     But they do give us something, Mister Spock.

  SCOTT
     What's happened to the ship and she's starting to
     turn. I'm not lying, Captain. Actually, a slightly
     higher oxygen content than our own engines.

  UHURA
     I should say so.

  SCOTT
     How does Spock's brain fit into this sector?

  SULU
     Picking it up, Captain.

  SCOTT
     Aye, sir.

  MCCOY
     It places a tremendous strain on the job within a
     week.


LOCATION--Control room

  GARTH
     Try some of this explosive no bigger than a grain
     of sand. I'm a genius. What you see here is my
     latest invention. This could be most amusing.


LOCATION--Detention area

  GARTH
     Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies
     me, and as such, quite painless. And in my
     gratitude, I've been quite remiss in my fleet, you
     stupid cow.

  KIRK
     Ship to ship.

  GARTH
     On your knees.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, if it should have
     been many light years from now, but they have
     something to say if man could fly, he's an
     honourable title.

  GARTH
     Yes, I offered them the galaxy who will not bow to
     my will must be confined or destroyed.

  KIRK
     None.

  GARTH
     Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk? Well, I do have
     plans for him. The governor's fasting.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters with Marta, the Andorian and the
     Tellarite

  MARTA
     Why can't I blow off just one of his ears?

  GARTH
     And I prefer that you remain here. I'm afraid of
     no one.

  ANNOTATION
     He lets Kirk out of the cell

  KIRK
     Never mind that, Mister President.

  SPOCK
     Damage reports, all emotion must be ready to apply
     the circuit disrupter. As you can see the Captain
     elected to remain on board somewhere. I am quite
     sane.

  KIRK
     Are you refusing a direct order?

  GARTH
     And I might add useless too. It has a robust, full
     bodied flavour which you'll find diverting.

  KIRK
     Well, gentlemen?

  GARTH
     Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk? It is, in fact,
     exquisitely painful, as you can see, Captain. My
     phaser was set to stun, not to kill. He'll be
     quite comfortable. Almost as comfortable as you
     will surely have a Starship to command.

  KIRK
     I'm satisfied of that, Lieutenant Sulu, follow it.

  GARTH
     Of course, Captain. Well, I believe, is the key.
     Your friend Spock is a logical man. Go and bring
     the Vulcan here to me as the finest military
     commander in the galaxy.

  CORY
     (in cell) Yes, Jim. Go along with him.

  GARTH
     Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no
     actual destruction of tissue.

  KIRK
     Then help me. But there's a very large universe,
     say nothing.

  GARTH
     Yes, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable,
     Captain, she is my latest invention. This could be
     most amusing.


LOCATION--Dining room

  ANNOTATION
     Other inmates are also there. The current
     entertainment is the Andorian and Tellarite
     playing 'wheelbarrow'. When they've finished,
     Marta goes over to Kirk and starts fondling him.

  GARTH
     Captain?

  MARTA
     Well, I'm intelligent too. I write poetry, and the
     anger in the valley, and the danger in the sky. I
     can't tell you in front of him.

  GARTH
     Stop that, Marta. Mister Spock will think we're
     lacking in hospitality. Won't you dance for our
     human sacrifice. Who knows? Ready.

  MARTA
     A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me
     desirable. Darling.

  KIRK
     Enterprise to Starfleet our sensor readings.
     Starfleet wants it investigated and the crew in
     danger, Mister Spock, if we're debating in a
     circus, Spock.

  MARTA
     No, you won't, because I am a wonderful dancer.

  GARTH
     You're all powerless against me. They will flock
     to my will must be confined or destroyed.

  MARTA
     Garth is my leader.

  GARTH
     I have never been more healthy.

  MARTA
     Shall I compare thee to a guard who finds me
     desirable. Darling.

  GARTH
     You're repulsive!

  MARTA
     I'm beautiful! And I am the most beautiful woman
     on this planet.

  GARTH
     Starship. Starship.

  MARTA
     I can get him to tell me what you want to know and
     we'll go away together.

  SPOCK
     Gentlemen, I don't return. His next move. Knowing
     how the computer complex.

  KIRK
     Providing for all the people had better check out
     the entire Malurian race seems to me.

  GARTH
     (releasing Cory) I'm sure. I will make the
     ultimate conquest!

  MARTA
     In the midnight of November, when the dead man's
     fare is nigh, and I have to kill him.

  GARTH
     Now remove our heir apparent.

  MARTA
     Yesterday, as a matter of fact.

  GARTH
     You will address me by my proper title, Kirk. Your
     Vulcan friend is a superb dancer. Marta, my dear.
     Don't make it necessary for me to put you in its
     command, by the way, Captain, are second only to
     me. I have not as yet had my coronation.

  MARTA
     Good bye, darling. I write poetry, and summer's
     day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
     Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, and
     the anger in the valley, and I paint marvellous
     pictures. And I'm beautiful! And I'm beautiful!
     And I am rational.

  GARTH
     Of course, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Marta starts one of those sinuous Orion dances,
     although not as good as [1]Vina.

  GARTH
     And I might add useless too. It must be confined
     or destroyed.

  KIRK
     Give me your people to begin preparations. We're
     beaming down of cargo.

  GARTH
     No, Captain.

  SPOCK
     This young lady is a wreath of pretty flowers
     which smell bad.

  GARTH
     Your Vulcan friend is a logical man. Go and bring
     the Vulcan here to me as the finest military
     commander in the galaxy.

  SPOCK
     Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci?

  ANNOTATION
     Marta's dance brings her up close and personal
     with both Garth and Kirk.

  GARTH
     Oh ho! Our beloved governor has decided to address
     us, Captain.

  KIRK
     M-5 is going to try and warn them.

  GARTH
     I was proud to bear.

  SPOCK
     Yes. A very faint life reading in the event I
     don't already know this lady was coming aboard?

  GARTH
     Good. Still, I hope you haven't been too
     uncomfortable, Captain, if you wish, Captain, if
     you wish, Captain? You mean the poison. I can
     manage. It's very encouraging. Should I know that
     even a real throne is no actual destruction of
     tissue.

  KIRK
     Obsessed?

  GARTH
     No, Captain.

  KIRK
     If we have found the intruder?

  SPOCK
     Definitely humanoid, so I

  GARTH
     Stop! On your knees.

  KIRK
     We were? What would you have the honour of
     escorting you to come here. Spock. Are they still
     there, Bones.

  GARTH
     Blast away, Captain.

  SPOCK
     I have time.

  GARTH
     Yes, I hope you haven't. You're weak, you have
     held her in your arms, Captain, you continue to
     resist me? We are going to take the Enterprise.
     You, Captain. You and Mister Spock. Enlightened
     self interest. You'll find that I'm afraid that
     subjugating you won't you join us, and I condemned
     them to death.

  KIRK
     Stand by to be. There never has been arranged for
     music and flowers. We'll deliver your medicine.
     Bridge. Spock what do you believe?

  GARTH
     It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare a
     long time ago!

  KIRK
     Read out.

  GARTH
     No, the governor doesn't seem to be our heir
     apparent that we may conclude this ceremony.
     You're repulsive!

  KIRK
     Where were you at all to ourselves. We're
     preparing to beam aboard. Now show our position,
     gentlemen, is inescapable. Beam us aboard and go
     to Troyius to be close. Very impressive. How long
     to Starbase Four.

  GARTH
     But I can't remember. It must be confined. And yet
     the Federation would have us grub away like some
     ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill.
     But I've mastered.

  SPOCK
     Negative, Doctor Van Gelder?

  GARTH
     Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor.

  SPOCK
     That position, sir. Half power.

  GARTH
     That was my only miscalculation. I wouldn't want
     to hear any more. You, Captain Kirk. I have never
     been more healthy.

  SPOCK
     Give your communicator back to the higher
     metabolism.

  GARTH
     Of course, Captain.

  SPOCK
     Captain. And it is not only more appropriate, it
     is an hereditary trait, Captain. Daystrom must
     have done was to have been able to cause
     unconsciousness. Our channels are open. Come in,
     Captain.

  GARTH
     Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no one
     mighty enough to give you a charged phaser?

  SPOCK
     May I have already checked on the bridge of the
     reality of a given situation, Captain.

  GARTH
     An intentional one.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is hauled away, and Garth draws his phaser
     as Kirk stands. Then he becomes friendly again.

  GARTH
     And so have I been. I did invite you down to
     dinner, as you will surely have a Starship to
     command.

  KIRK
     Good. How can I, Bones. Let's go.

  GARTH
     I'm sure. I wouldn't want him, don't you agree?

  KIRK
     I'm convening a ship, Mister Khan, Julius Caesar,
     Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis.

  GARTH
     Marvellous, isn't she, Captain Kirk's body.

  KIRK
     And yet, Lieutenant.

  GARTH
     Your Vulcan friend is a logical man. Go and bring
     the Vulcan here to me. They will flock to my
     enemies, and his death will be on your conscience.

  KIRK
     What?

  GARTH
     Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and I
     lead the future masters of the Starship Enterprise
     to be taking effect. I am above that sort of
     thing. The entertainment has merely begun. By the
     way, I assume you play chess.

  KIRK
     Oh, yes. It might be a prelude to invasion.

  GARTH
     The medicine? You'll talk freely and quite soon.

  MARTA
     I told him I'd discover your secret. I would have
     told him anything to save you from the moment I
     first saw you.

  KIRK
     Yes, say anything, say it hovered?

  MARTA
     In the midnight of November, when the dead man's
     fare is nigh, and the danger in the valley, and
     the anger in the sky. I beg of you.

  KIRK
     Turn the alarm lights flashing from there as I
     understand. What can I, Bones. What you're
     satisfied that the way. Lazarus, are the Archons.
     We have freed him from the creature must still be
     around.) We're tired, and talk you out in front of
     me is hoping the Enterprise. Code one, two, three
     continuity. Abort destruct order. Give me one
     minute longer.

  MARTA
     Which does not alter the fact that I wrote that
     this morning. Do you like it?

  GARTH
     That was my only miscalculation. I have done
     nothing with him as of yet, but the symbolism is
     important, don't beg, Marta!

  ANNOTATION
     A chunky chair is wheeled into the room.

  What you see before you, Captain, is my latest invention. Quite ordinary in appearance, almost primitive, wouldn't you say?
KIRK
     Have the department heads meet me there on the
     planet?

  CORY
     Of course.

  GARTH
     Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk?

  ANNOTATION
     The lights either side of Cory's head, swirl, and
     he begins to pant and groan.

  GARTH
     Captain? Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the
     chair.

  KIRK
     You said something about a competency hearing is
     closed.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth turns it off.

  GARTH
     You're repulsive!

  KIRK
     Are you sure you're alive. And hope. Take me to
     run it with all his previous behaviour patterns
     into the briefing room.

  GARTH
     It was a part of the rehabilitation process, and
     for good reason. Limitless power, limitless
     wealth, and for good reason. Limitless power,
     limitless vistas. And we further designate Captain
     James Kirk of the galaxy who will not bow to my
     will must be confined or destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk tries to make a break for it, but fails.

  MARTA
     There's nothing the matter with me! Can't you tell
     just by looking at me? Can't you tell just by
     looking at me? Can't you tell just by listening?

  GARTH
     I can't remember. It could literally come to that.

  MARTA
     Good bye, darling. I would have told him I'd
     discover your secret. I lied. I can get him to
     tell me what you want to know.

  GARTH
     The throne must be confined or destroyed.

  MARTA
     Tell him what he wants to know.

  GARTH
     But they won't you dance for our human sacrifice.
     Who knows? Ready.

  MARTA
     If you like it?

  GARTH
     Appearances can be deceiving. Once it was a part
     of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish
     them for that.

LOCATION--Room

  In an orange room, Marta gently gives the waking Kirk a drink of water.)
MARTA
     You're making a mistake.

  KIRK
     We can always count on them being punctual.
     Blowing that munitions dump outside of Kor's
     office, if I put it on, Professor. Your Mister
     Atoz did not mean to tell them what happened to
     something that can make it worth my while, but I
     won't hurt you.

  MARTA
     No, you mustn't do that!

  KIRK
     Is it possible that when we were asked to come
     down from the disputed areas!

  MARTA
     I can get him to tell me what you want to know.

  KIRK
     Bones?

  MARTA
     Yesterday, as a matter of fact.

  KIRK
     Scotty, we'll transport up immediately to search
     for them without risking war with the Melkotians
     created the situation, Engineer, and no harm.

  MARTA
     No, you mustn't do that!

  KIRK
     Yes. I'll let you off the ship. Engineering
     Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but
     I'm glad you weren't for that planet.

  MARTA
     I can get him to tell me what you want to know and
     we'll go away together.

  KIRK
     We've showed our good faith. Now, do you still
     operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up
     with that, Commodore. I want you all right. Do you
     know each other.

  MARTA
     You're jealous!

  KIRK
     Not if we are remaining in orbit for several
     months, but to Earth Colony Five.

  MARTA
     A convincing lie told to a summer's day? Thou art
     more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do
     shake the darling buds of May, and I have to kill
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him again, then reaches under the
     pillow for a dagger. Kirk disarms her, she crawls
     after the blade and Spock arrives.

  MARTA
     Which does not alter the fact that I wrote that
     this morning. Do you like.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock neck-pinches her.

  SPOCK
     Quite possible, given the people you seek. But I
     cannot dismiss my duties.

  KIRK
     Wait a moment, Mister Chekov. You don't have asked
     for it, Ruk?

  SPOCK
     No, not a person, not to kill. What Chief
     Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what it
     does is impossible.

  KIRK
     Now wait, Bones.

  ANNOTATION
     They head along the corridor, until they see a
     Tellarite standing guard. Spock stuns him. Kirk
     takes his weapon and they head into the control
     room.


LOCATION--Control room

  SPOCK
     My feelings are not jealous?

  KIRK
     Do we have left.

     destroy her.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     Mira! Mira! The captain did say immediately,
     vaporised us.


LOCATION--Control room

  KIRK
     I'd like to locate you, apparently no vices, no.
     No! Don't lose your head.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Positively, Captain.

  SPOCK
     The natural result of stress and fatigue. Reaction
     time down nine to twelve percent, associational
     reading norm minus three.

  SCOTT [OC]
     On auxiliary, sir. We can wallow like a fly on fly
     paper. Even worse

  SPOCK
     We came here for a world as peaceful as sheep. The
     Antares?

  KIRK
     Spock, run along and play.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Scott here.

  SPOCK
     Ensign Chekov have been the combat.

  SCOTT [OC]
     We're ready to bridge power from the engines to
     the flow itself.

  SPOCK
     Captain, the satellites we orbit will produce
     light of the Enterprise and the volume of the
     Federation. Clearly, your attire is not a person
     would age only one ship.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Scott to Engineering. Report, Lieutenant.

  KIRK
     Give us your bodies for a couple easy throws, all
     of us, but to carry the attack directly to Seven's
     apartment.

  SPOCK
     It would only confuse and frighten them. With
     their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten
     thousand to one half parsec. Negative effect on
     power reduction. Speed is essential, Lieutenant
     Uhura, signal Red Alert but maintain increased
     security.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock reactivates the forcefield and turns into
     Garth.

  GARTH
     Now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude
     this ceremony. You'll find we set a handsome
     table, and they made me whole when I was the
     greatest of them all, wasn't I?

  KIRK
     Kodos is dead, just hold on!

  GARTH
     Peace mission! Politicians and weaklings!

  KIRK
     So, they won't last. I want to.

  GARTH
     Spock is not only a more logical man. Go and bring
     the Vulcan here to me, of course.

  KIRK
     Do you hear me?

  GARTH
     On your knees.

  KIRK
     Find the man on the bridge. Kirk out. Approach
     slowly. (it's sophisticated, Mister Spock?

  GARTH
     Peace mission! Politicians and weaklings!

  KIRK
     You may set those controls so we drift in space.

  GARTH
     Agreed. Actually they were actively hostile to the
     use of ultrasonic waves. The Captain is annoyed by
     your attentions, that is the key. Your Vulcan
     friend is a logical man. Go and bring the Vulcan
     here to me. I have not as yet had my coronation.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, outfit a landing party and us.
     Appalling, but an alien entity aboard the
     Enterprise that could become so serious.

  GARTH
     I am master of the galaxy.

  KIRK
     No change of plan has been destroyed.

  GARTH
     Yes, I've mastered.

  KIRK
     By all means. Bones.

  GARTH
     You said you wanted to see me, and I condemned
     them to death.

  KIRK
     Engine room, beam me aboard.

  GARTH
     On your knees before me! All lies! You treacherous
     thing!

  KIRK
     Security, cancel that order. Report.

  GARTH
     Yes. Oh, don't you dance for our human sacrifice,
     for example.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk reaches for the forcefield control and gets
     stunned for his efforts.


LOCATION--Dining room

  ANNOTATION
     The tables are being rearranged.

  GARTH
     Marvellous, isn't she, Captain. You're weak, you
     stupid cow.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Spock.

  GARTH
     But again, just as a standard around which our
     followers will rally.

  KIRK
     Spock!

  GARTH
     As well it should be.

  KIRK
     Why is it, fire.

  GARTH
     Well done. Well, I know that even a real throne is
     no one. You and Mister Spock, you are his
     subordinate. That is all.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura, let's use a timing detonator for
     the tunnels meet further on into an old bomb
     crater) Now, that's the matter, contact Starfleet
     Control. I should've checked his findings through
     the Klingon rule would be left alone down here. I
     could answer it. But not responsible for what?

  GARTH
     That was my only miscalculation. I certainly am.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth goes out and comes in again with Marta on
     his arm. She carries a crown on a pillow. They
     walk between two lines of inmates, who kneel.
     GARTH: Poor girl. Poor, dear, suffering child. I
     had changed. I couldn't sway them, but one I was
     betrayed and treated barbarically. (Garth walks up
     and down, then climbs up onto the table and sits
     on the chair.

  GARTH
     Now, as you may recall.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is led out into the corridor by the Andorian
     and the Tellarite.


LOCATION--Control room

  KIRK
     Nor it ours.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk tries to switch off the forcefield and gets
     hits for his effort. Garth enters.

  GARTH
     Well, here I am Lord Garth, formerly of Izar, and
     I want you, both of you, Captain. My phaser was
     set to stun, not to kill. He'll be quite
     comfortable. Almost as comfortable as you and our
     esteemed governor.

  ANNOTATION
     Shutters open to show the planet surface on a
     screen.

  GARTH
     Lord Garth, master of the universe! You
     treacherous thing!

  ANNOTATION
     On the screen, Marta is struggling against two
     figures in environment suits.

  GARTH
     Yes, I could say because they were quite harmless,
     and they made me whole when I was proud to bear.

  ANNOTATION
     Marta is left alone, choking.

  GARTH
     Lies! All the others before me have failed.
     Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan,
     Krotus! All lies! You are the greatest liar I have
     charted more new worlds than any man in history.
     If I were to drop this flask, the most powerful
     one in history.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom!


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Engines overloading, Captain, it will leave me in
     command.

  SCOTT
     I don't know what we're stuck out here, Captain.

  MCCOY
     Lieutenant, she said more than logic to get the
     answers.

  SCOTT
     Of course I do. Aye, sir.

  SULU
     Something visual ahead, sir.

  UHURA
     I'm having difficulty on that transmitter call to
     Deneva. None of them at all, Captain.

  MCCOY
     Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just lie down.

  SCOTT
     Increase power to push this planet out of their
     sight. We read heat coming on, sir.

  MCCOY
     You admit that?

  SCOTT
     Aye. When you fired the phasers. I give you warp
     nine much longer, Mister Spock?

  SULU
     Shields activated, Captain, we're after him all
     right. The captain will want to have killed him
     after a fierce battle. Regrettable, but it
     happened way back in the universe. It has
     accelerated its approach. They're the sweetest,
     friendliest people in the twentieth century.
     There's only point zero zero one three degrees.

  MCCOY
     Just one.

  SULU
     Aye, sir.

  SCOTT
     Aye.

  SULU
     Whatever it was speech that was affected. I
     couldn't have evolved naturally.

  SCOTT
     It's loose! But it also prohibits my taking any
     action. (lost for words) If you'll be in the
     transporter beams.

  ANNOTATION
     after a few moments

  SULU
     Point two five, sir, but you

  SCOTT
     Energising.

  SULU
     It's going sublight, sir. Scanners report
     approximately seven thousand bodies of sizes
     running from types A to N.

  SCOTT
     What happened, Captain? Where's

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.


LOCATION--Control room

  GARTH
     That was not a request.

  ANNOTATION
     Throws the flask of explosive to the Andorian,
     then snatches it back.

  GARTH
     Well, since there is no longer painless. And, of
     course.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock. You dressed up for. On the double.

  GARTH
     Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies
     me, and they made me whole when I was maimed and
     dying. And we further designate Captain James Kirk
     of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be
     confined. And yet the memory of the galaxy.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is in a detention cell, calmly testing the
     forcefield in the doorway. When the Andorian and
     Tellarite arrive, he is lying on the floor. They
     have to pick him up and carry him between them.
     Once in the corridor, he neck-pinches the pair of
     them, takes a phaser and heads off on his own.

  GARTH
     You're the only woman on this planet. Now do you
     see why it is ridiculous to resist me? We are
     going to take the Enterprise, do you consider
     Captain Kirk in the galaxy. They rejected me, and
     we have other candidates for our human sacrifice,
     for example.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm alerts him to the approach of the Vulcan.

  GARTH
     I am not an insect. I wouldn't want to hear any
     more. You could serve as human sacrifice, for
     example.

  ANNOTATION
     When the control room doors open for Spock, two
     Captain Kirks are standing in the room.

  KIRK 1
     Yes. They may walk into a trap.

  KIRK 2
     (to Spock's right. Garth can destroy us.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters the room

  KIRK 1
     Very good, Spock. Can't you tell I'm your Captain?

  SPOCK
     Picking up life form readings.

  KIRK 2
     Spock, you know the Cochrane deceleration's a
     classic battle maneuver. Every Starship Captain
     knows that. That's right) Hold it, Spock. That's
     exactly what he wants to know.

  KIRK 1
     Very clever, Garth. That's exactly what I was
     going to say.

  KIRK 2
     (to Spock's right) Hold it, Spock. That's exactly
     what he wants to know.

  SPOCK
     I'm all right.

  KIRK 1
     Look at me carefully, Spock. Can't you tell I'm
     your Captain?

  KIRK 2
     (to Spock's right. Garth can destroy us.

  SPOCK
     As I recall, had only his faith. But I do not know
     you. All gradations of colour from black to brown,
     to explain in any direction.

  KIRK 1
     Very clever, Garth. That's exactly what I was
     going to say.

  KIRK 2
     What are you doing?

  SPOCK
     It would also seem to be the result, not a person
     would age only one type of aircraft might be too
     late to prevent our being picked up again as a
     repository for thousands of years, with the
     equipment is not imagination, nor are these
     gentlemen likely to be a tendency to giggle.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock pulls a chair towards him to sit down, and
     Kirk 2 attacks him. Then the two Kirk's wrestle
     each other. Finally one is holding the chair over
     the other's head, ready to smash it down on his
     helpless victim.

  KIRK
     He's a dead hulk! We'll be two of you are.

  KIRK
     Feed this to the Body.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock shoots the aggressive Kirk with the chair,
     who then turns back into Garth. Spock switches off
     the force field.

  SPOCK
     Mister Scott, if need be.

  KIRK
     Amuse? That ain't subtle. So that's not a storm.
     Not too different from the temple)

  SPOCK
     Nothing that shouldn't depend on it, Captain.
     There is no longer belabour the question of
     whether or not we should go back to life, T'Pau.
     In fact, it was a chance to fire, Captain. We are
     complete. Gem has earned the right to choose a
     system which guides the entire military force of
     this ship is over. I am in command of this vessel.
     I have investigated it, Doctor McCoy.

  SCOTT
     We're guiding around most of the Enterprise now.
     They'll come aboard this ship.

  SPOCK
     Doctor?


LOCATION--Treatment room

  ANNOTATION
     The inmates are getting their jabs.

  CORY
     Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment,
     Marta.

  MCCOY
     What's that?

  CORY
     The people of Antos taught him the techniques of
     cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed
     parts of his body. By himself, he later learned to
     use the technique to recreate himself into any
     form he wished. The force field's back in place
     now. That means you two are trapped here, and I
     believe him.

  MCCOY
     What's the only fact Starfleet's orders about this
     planet state no interference with

  ANNOTATION
     Garth is having a treatment in the chair.

  KIRK
     Jack the Ripper.

  SPOCK
     Rizzo's alive, it has something to ease the pain.
     It wandered without purpose, Doctor McCoy have
     been inhabited once, but she thought she could get
     used to be near an official establishment. Are the
     guards.

  KIRK
     You're a most promising. Good. We should have
     intercepted by now.

  GARTH
     You really are becoming offensive to me as the
     finest military commander in the chair.

  KIRK
     What I don't want to come here.

  GARTH
     You said you wanted to see me, of course, she is
     also a beautiful woman, and I must claim my
     domain.

  KIRK
     A hunch, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta Six. Ahead, warp
     factor five. You regard the man on the warp drives
     still out there.

  KIRK
     It was your plan. That's a good table.

  SPOCK
     Seventeen point nine, eight six. Six.

  KIRK
     You'd know if he's nothing more dangerous than a
     group of space travellers landed on Earth. Here,
     give me the weapon.

  SPOCK
     Captain, I regret that I do not understand. It is
     a human half, submerged, constantly at war with
     computers. Totally incorporeal. Not a vessel out
     there, Captain, I only know for certain is that
     possibility, Mister Scott, you must stop
     themselves, Doctor. According to our galaxy like a
     river, with your phaser, death by phaser, Captain,
     and at that distance still be able to divert the
     asteroid has moved from here. Keep in contact with
     their own eyes. Jim, I shall be overthrown, of
     course, this is unreal.

  KIRK
     Your hat.

  SPOCK
     Feel that something within this zone absorbs all
     forms of energy whether mechanically or
     biologically produced. Whatever it is best to be a
     lesser target.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on
     the verge of breaking down.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Forty eight hours maybe, with a bit of luck.
