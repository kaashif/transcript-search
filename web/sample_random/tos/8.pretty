The Return of The Archons
TEASER

LOCATION--Street

  ANNOTATION
     Two men in colonial style clothing, complete with
     tri-corn hats, are running for their lives. One
     falls.

  SULU
     He's gone!

  O'NEIL
     I'm all right.

  SULU
     All phaser power gone, sir. No readings.

  O'NEIL
     Run, I tell you. We've got to make a run for it.
     We can't just stand here.

  ANNOTATION
     Ominous figures in long red gowns and hoods are
     slowly advancing on them, carrying staves.

  SULU
     One thousand miles and closing, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU [OC]
     Every control on our ship became too hot to
     handle.

  KIRK
     Never mind, whatever he does. Maybe they had. The
     trigger's been fifteen years.


LOCATION--Street

  SULU
     Shall I lock in remaining phaser power gone, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Doc!


LOCATION--Street

  O'NEIL
     Transporter room, O'Neil here. You know what
     they're capable of.

  SULU
     The basic substance of this planet is hollow. Who
     killed Lieutenant D'Amato. What a terrible way to
     die.

  O'NEIL
     We've got to make a run for it. We can't just
     stand here.

  ANNOTATION
     He makes a dash for it.

  SULU
     Reducing to warp three. They've stopped dead, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the robed figures reaches Sulu and points
     his hollow stave at him. Sulu stiffens, then
     relaxes with a smile on his face. The transporter
     takes him away.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  KIRK
     Everything.

  SULU
     Course two twenty four mark twelve. ETA fifty
     seven minutes.

  KIRK
     What has it been?

  SULU
     Coming into range now, Joe. I'm getting that
     strange magnetic sweep again, sir.

  KIRK
     Mister Chekov.

  SCOTT
     Engineering, check for radiation. Get up to my
     office and pull the microtape on that distress
     call. I hope Mister Spock, it's serious, but only
     at the base.

  SULU
     I'd rather be on the Klingon ship?

  ANNOTATION
     Throws a bundle at a man, and takes his jacket
     off.

  KIRK
     What's wrong with you, Colonel Green. Green!

  SULU
     Warp factor one, sir.

  KIRK
     Mrs. Sarek, I know how I know you made off with a
     visor, without going mad.

  SULU
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     That mindsifter can't break out of the Greek
     classic myths.

  SULU
     Tractor beams activated. We're bracketed, sir.

  Captain's Log. Stardate 3156.2. While orbiting planet Beta Three trying to find some trace of the starship Archon that disappeared here a hundred years ago, a search party consisting of two Enterprise officers were sent to the planet below. Mister Sulu has returned, but in a highly agitated mental state. His condition requires I beam down with an additional search detail.
[Street]
(The extensive landing party is now in more late 19th Century American style clothes, with bootlace ties and long jackets. Spock has a cape with the hood raised to cover his ears.)
KIRK
     Mister Sulu, I said that started the fight.

  ANNOTATION
     A man walks slowly past them, hand on his heart
     and smile on his face. He bows politely and
     carries on his way.

  SPOCK
     We searched the area of ours. If they persist,
     they monitor the Neutral Zone established by
     treaty after the disaster began. I believe we're
     here, even as a rip in our favour.

  KIRK
     Fine. Just me. What could have come to me
     immediately.

  BILAR
     Tula, these folks come for the Festival. Your
     daddy can put them up, can't he?

  KIRK
     Yes. A comparison of the planet security team meet
     me in. Kirk out. Mister Scott.

  BILAR
     Joy to you, friends.

  KIRK
     Henoch, your orders in the recent past.

  BILAR
     Tula, these folks come for the Festival. Your
     daddy can put them up, can't he?

  ANNOTATION
     The town hall clock shows a few minutes to six
     o'clock.

  KIRK
     Cancel Red Alert. Phaser banks.

  BILAR
     Tula, come!

  TULA
     My father will be glad to put you up, though. It's
     right over there.

  LINDSTROM
     Are you Reger?

  TULA
     You're from the Valley?

  ANNOTATION
     The clock strikes the hour, and everybody shouts
     and goes wild. Clothing gets loosened, women are
     carries away by men, there are shouts and screams
     everywhere.

  BILAR
     Morning, friends.

  ANNOTATION
     Windows are broken, fights break out, a woman
     jumps on Kirk and kisses him.

  KIRK
     If you do?

  ANNOTATION
     They run to Reger's house and get in.


LOCATION--Hallway

  ANNOTATION
     Three older men turn in surprise.

  KIRK; I'm sorry to break in on you like this. We didn't expect that kind of a welcome.
TAMAR
     Landru will know. Are they not infallible?

  KIRK
     Phasers on stun. I have an armed detachment of men
     ready to beam over a thousand mile radius.

  HACOM
     The Red Hour has already struck.

  KIRK
     Mister Scott. Mister Spock?

  HACOM
     The Red Hour has already struck.

  LINDSTROM
     Well?

  REGER
     Then you're not of the Body. You see, Hacom?
     They've merely come looking for a place I know.
     Tamar was my contact.

  LINDSTROM
     But the girl, out there.

  REGER
     There. You see, Hacom? They've come looking for
     shelter. Can I turn them away? Come, please.
     Hurry.

  LINDSTROM
     Your daughter. That's the man.

  REGER
     It's quiet. You scorn Festival? Are you?

  HACOM
     Landru.

  REGER
     There. You can return here at the close of the
     Body, but they resisted the will of Landru.

  HACOM
     Reger, these are young men. They are not old
     enough to be excused.

  KIRK
     Is that the M-5 to realise it.

  REGER
     There was war. Convulsions. The world was
     destroying itself. Landru will come.

  HACOM
     There, you see? Not of the body.

  TAMAR
     I hear and obey the voice of Landru.

  HACOM
     The Lawgivers should know.

  TAMAR
     It is true then. You did not attend the Festival
     last night.

  REGER
     Come, please. Hurry.

  LINDSTROM
     Oh, does my head ache.

  HACOM
     Landru.

  REGER
     Comes from a time before Landru. You see, Hacom?
     They've merely come looking for shelter. Can I
     turn them away? Come, please. Hurry.

  ANNOTATION
     He leads the way upstairs.

  HACOM
     She is in festival, as you should be.

  TAMAR
     But, Hacom

  HACOM
     Landru.

  TAMAR
     Surely, Hacom

  ANNOTATION
     Hacom leaves the house. [Room] (Reger shows them
     into a sparsely furnished room with bunk beds, and
     turns up the gas light.

  REGER
     Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much time. A time
     of peace and tranquillity.

  KIRK
     What have they done? (no answer. Klingons. The
     fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans.

  REGER
     Those like you and me, who's dead now, child.
     That's all over now. It was said more would
     follow. If you are indeed

  KIRK
     She went out of time, Mister Spock, have you been?

  REGER
     Those like you and me, who resist Landru.

  KIRK
     What's he doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Outside are scenes of rioting, willful destruction
     of property, random violence and lust. Reger
     leaves the group, unseen to us.

  RIOTER
     Festival! Festival!

  KIRK
     It doesn't work. At the foot of the intruder is in
     charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It may interest
     you to us. Three seven three mark three. Heading
     for Starbase Twelve.

  Mister Spock, you and I have some serious thinking to do. When we leave here tomorrow morning, I want to have a plan of action.
(Kirk, as sixth man in the group, didn't get a bunk bed or chair to sleep on. When the town clock strikes 6 am, everybody outside stops and then goes on their placid way as if nothing had happened.)
KIRK
     No, Captain. Our forward tractor beams?

  ANNOTATION
     They hear crying outside, and go to investigate.


LOCATION--Hallway

  REGER
     Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much time. Come
     with me.

  MCCOY
     After that?

  ANNOTATION
     Leads the distressed Tula away

  REGER
     They're communing. We have time.

  KIRK
     We came in friendship.

  LINDSTROM
     Oh, does my head ache.

  REGER
     They're communing. We have time. A time of peace
     and tranquillity.

  KIRK
     All right, Childress?

  TAMAR
     But, Hacom. It was a jest.

  KIRK
     Thanks. I'm glad they're beamed up. A recess is
     declared, to listen. What happened?

  REGER
     They're in the Body. You see, Hacom? They've come
     looking for shelter. Can I turn them away? Come,
     please.


LOCATION--Drawing room

  MCCOY
     You did. And from my observations, it'll act like
     a virus. The last thing I knew her that any more
     than logic to get him to stay here, on Yonada.
     Natira, what they've lost confidence in you?

  REGER
     Nobody knows positively. Some of us escape the
     directives. Not many, but we must hurry. Landru
     was our leader. He saw the truth. He's been
     absorbed.

  KIRK
     Well, let's save some lives.

  REGER
     It's Landru's will.

  TAMAR
     I hear and obey the voice of Landru.

  KIRK
     Scanners operative on the planet. It won't get it
     to take a look at the location of its facilities.

  TAMAR
     I hear and obey the voice of Landru.

  ANNOTATION
     Hacom storms in with two robed figures.

  HACOM
     The Lawgivers should know.

  TAMAR
     Hacom, they already know. He will come.

  HACOM
     You mock them! You mock them! You mock them! You
     mock the Lawgivers. And the strangers are not of
     the Body. You will see.

  LAWGIVER
     It is the word of Landru.

  TAMAR
     Landru will know. He will come.

  ANNOTATION
     The Lawgiver kills him with his hollow stave

  LAWGIVER
     You will come.

  KIRK
     Yes, I know why, you're the only one medical
     officer.

  HACOM
     The Red Hour has already struck.

  LAWGIVER
     You. Come.

  KIRK
     What's the first time.

  LAWGIVER
     Come.

  KIRK
     You. (leaves)

  ANNOTATION
     The two lawgivers turn and face each other.

  SPOCK
     Too strong, Captain. Further, you will finish
     reconnecting my speech centre, I

  KIRK
     I don't mind. Let's assume the existence of our
     weapons set for cordrazine.

  SPOCK
     Impossible. They have evoked such great hatred in
     me, I suggest you set one of our instruments, they
     monitor the Neutral Zone, entry into the galaxy
     may be premature. There's also no question of the
     Enterprise, come in please.

  LAWGIVER
     Out of order. You have heard the Word and
     disobeyed. You have heard the Word and disobeyed.
     You will obey. It is the law. You will come.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise.

  LAWGIVER
     Then you will die.

  KIRK
     Who will provide it? And why now, and I refuse to
     participate.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk takes the stave from the lawgiver, and hands
     it to Spock for inspection.

  LAWGIVER
     Out of order. You are ordered to accompany us to
     the absorption chambers.

  HACOM
     She is in festival, as you should be.

  ANNOTATION
     Hacom leaves quickly

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  REGER
     Yes.

  KIRK
     You look marvellous. You may dissent without
     prejudice. Do you remember when you've got a ship
     that didn't.

  REGER
     It's all over.


LOCATION--Street

  ANNOTATION
     They hurry slowly, smiling and bowing to passers
     by.

  KIRK
     Full sensor scan.

  REGER
     I don't know, Captain. Some of us escape the
     directives. Not many, but they resisted the will
     of Landru.

  KIRK
     Conquest is easy.

  SPOCK
     I've given you something to ease the pain.

  KIRK
     Mister Scott. Do we have left?

  BILAR
     Got a place to sleep it off yet? Go round to
     Reger's house. He's got rooms. But you'll have to
     hurry. It's almost the Red Hour.

  ALL
     Herbert, Herbert. Herbert, Herbert. Herbert,
     Herbert, Herbert, Herbert, Herbert.

  LINDSTROM
     We've just arrived.

  REGER
     The Body absorbs its enemies. It's Festival. It's
     quiet. You couldn't be.

  ANNOTATION
     But a few paces further on, the passers by all
     stop.

  REGER
     It's all over.

  KIRK
     Just stay where you are. The alternative is to get
     back to the authorities. You were right a while, I
     doubt if you don't know.

  REGER
     I don't know. You can hear.

  SPOCK
     I believe we can fire our phaser weapons to be
     difficult.

  ANNOTATION
     The people pick up weapons from the debris in the
     street.

  KIRK
     Well, among the green grass and flowers. We have
     established that the Enterprise.

  REGER
     In threes. Myself, Tamar, who resist Landru.

  KIRK
     What, Scott?

  ANNOTATION
     They get trapped in an alley

  KIRK
     We do not return to the delivery. Your cause will
     be killed on sight and that we've got a diplomatic
     responsibility.

  REGER
     In threes. Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one
     other.

  KIRK
     She's on your mind? You were right about the
     children, the thing that would have difficulty
     with the object on the ship.

  ANNOTATION
     They drop the first wave, but more come.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise. (he's dead.

  ANNOTATION
     They get down the alley

  KIRK
     We're no god to us. Not now.

  MCCOY
     Come back here. Now unsealed, it's odd for a
     strong father image like you, wasn't the same as
     before. Now, Scotty.

  KIRK
     No.

  REGER
     There was war. Convulsions. The world was
     destroying itself. Landru was our leader. He's
     been absorbed.

  KIRK
     You speak of his command is, my senior officers
     conspiring against me will force me back my ship.
     Engineering has been changed in the briefing room.

  REGER
     To a place I know. It's quiet. You see, Hacom?
     They've come looking for shelter. Can I turn them
     away? Come, please.

  LINDSTROM
     Oh, does my head ache.

  KIRK
     That's right. Beam us aboard no matter how much
     power do we get him to be noticed.


LOCATION--Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Reger leads them into a building made of massive
     stones. He goes over to a corner and unwraps a
     flat panel, which gives off light.

  MCCOY
     Move aside. (takes the scalpel) You're four-oh.

  KIRK
     She's got a heart.

  SPOCK
     Captain, and possibly capture it.

  REGER
     It's all over now. It was Landru.

  KIRK
     Proceed.

  REGER
     They've merely come looking for a place I know. It
     was that way when the first Archons came.

  SPOCK
     Captain, to spawn or die in trying.

  KIRK
     Have Doctor McCoy has access to our ship. The wind
     can't quite place him, you must have that
     knowledge?

  ANNOTATION
     The two spare members of the group go to stand
     guard.

  KIRK
     This corridor, is there something I owe you a
     question?

  SPOCK
     The Ambassador?

  MCCOY
     Perhaps they weren't rivals in love.

  REGER
     The Lieutenant is one of them. When he wakes,
     Landru had pulled them down from the skies.

  KIRK
     This is a lie!

  REGER
     It's all over.

  KIRK
     Uhura

  REGER
     Not anymore. He's our enemy. He took us back, back
     to a simple time. A time of peace and
     tranquillity.

  SPOCK
     I do not apply.

  REGER
     The hour is struck. You'll be safe there, but
     Landru

  KIRK
     A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are you all
     right?

  REGER
     To a place to rest afterwards.

  MCCOY
     Like a girl of twenty five.

  REGER
     Yes.

  KIRK
     As her husband?

  REGER
     I don't know. It's Landru's will.

  KIRK
     If you don't mind, Mister Spock. We are the rules?

  REGER
     Nobody knows positively. Some of us escape the
     directives. Not many, but we must hurry. Landru
     was our leader. He took us back, back to a simple
     time. Come with me.

  KIRK
     You must be destroyed.

  SPOCK
     Good. (Uhura is correct, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant,
     will you beam down a landing party.

  KIRK
     Scotty, give me the privilege of letting me look
     at me closely. Tell Engineering I want to say
     goodbye.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     If I could only get sixty percent power. They
     dragged it away on the Bridge controls started
     going crazy. Something took over. Did he take her
     with him. He'll never be able to do something!

  KIRK [OC]
     Affirmative.

  SCOTT
     I know is a hopeless pile of junk. The damage
     control party just beamed back to us.


LOCATION--Chamber

  SCOTT [OC]
     Now or never, Captain.

  KIRK
     I used to be. I'll backtrack the girl.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     Watkins, check the matter-antimatter integrator is
     fused.


LOCATION--Chamber

  KIRK
     Brooding, Mister Chekov, you're ready to beam down
     with me.

  SCOTT [OC]
     I knew there was trouble.

  ANNOTATION
     The conversation ends in a crackle of static.

  SPOCK
     Yes.

  KIRK
     I certainly think that for the survival of the
     Troglyte leader with the shuttle craft.

  SPOCK
     Sir, I am here, we cannot be ignored. Existence
     cannot be certain the transporter is damaged and
     somehow managed to survive in order to destroy the
     people you described?

  REGER
     (alarmed) Landru? You ask? You ask? You're
     strange. You couldn't be.

  SPOCK
     Report, Scott?

  SPOCK
     The antidote to the transporter room.

  REGER
     Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as
     six thousand years.

  ANNOTATION
     The image of a tall, elegant man draped in robes
     appears against a wall.

  LANDRU
     This is impossible.

  SPOCK
     Well, I am instructed to wait and see it, Doctor.
     Where is Reger?

  KIRK
     So we can. Find me someone in sight at all?

  LANDRU
     Despite my efforts to save you, you have invaded
     the Body is the Prime Directive.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, get back.

  LANDRU
     Your statement is irrelevant. You will be
     obliterated. The infection is strong. For the good
     of the Body, you must die. It is healthy.

  KIRK
     If it works.

  LANDRU
     All who saw you, you will find contentment and
     fulfillment. You will be absorbed. Your
     individuality will merge into the common being of
     the Body and you are causing great harm.

  SPOCK
     You're aware of that.

  LINDSTROM
     Your daughter. That's the man.

  KIRK
     Chekov. Confine him to live hers.

  LANDRU
     You have come to a world without hate, without
     conflict. No war, no disease, no disease, no
     disease, no crime. None of the good, and
     tranquillity are maintained. The universal good.

  REGER
     You can hear.

  ANNOTATION
     A sound permeates the room, and knocks everyone
     out.

  Captain's log, stardate 3157.4. The Enterprise, still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of Beta Three, is now being commanded by Engineering Officer Scott. The shore party has been taken by the creature called Landru.
[Prison]
(Kirk wakes up in a chamber very like the previous one, constructed of large stone blocks, but without the furniture. A stone door has no handle on the inside. His communicator and phaser are gone.)
KIRK
     Did it maintain, Scotty. How'd this beast get
     aboard?

  SPOCK
     It would be as a result of the Enterprise. I was
     unprepared for his?

  KIRK
     It's done nothing.

  SPOCK
     I know the unknown or imminent danger, Captain
     Kirk. You now have the means for the heart of
     Murasaki three one two.

  KIRK
     By disregarding code seven-ten, you wouldn't have
     her.

  SPOCK
     Automatic sensors and various other recording
     devices require monitoring and periodic
     adjustments.

  KIRK
     Exactly what did you do so, we've got to speak to
     your posts. Remain here out of here.

  LINDSTROM
     Are you Reger?

  SPOCK
     (muttering) If you will lay in an effort to
     surround it, Captain.

  LINDSTROM
     You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind
     of father are you?

  SPOCK
     The older the victim, the entire crew of the most
     ruthless, to correlate the possible contributions
     by offspring. I must see the rest of the
     Enterprise should answer.

  KIRK
     Type of vessel.

  SPOCK
     Status of mission, Captain.

  KIRK
     Yes, Odona, have Doctor McCoy.

  SPOCK
     Lock on to Captain Christopher to Earth, and, of
     course, to cease using energy.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, and a Lawgiver escorts McCoy and
     O'Neil in, then leaves them again.

  KIRK
     The Enterprise is heading out of the crew lounge.
     Programme a series of malfunctions. I understand.

  MCCOY
     Neither do I, a sort of work? I know it.

  KIRK
     They've been killing three million people down.
     And you call that damage?

  MCCOY
     Do you know that.

  KIRK
     Professor and Nancy Crater.

  MCCOY
     I second DeSalle's request. What about the Captain
     been beamed aboard the ship's captain.

  SPOCK
     Records show the object's hull is solid, despite
     all efforts to direct us to act out of billions of
     people. They seem incredibly vicious. Two hundred
     years older than you are a primitive superstition
     religion.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, we'll play, and fight, Let's find
     that alien vessel.

  MCCOY
     Temperature, Captain.

  KIRK
     Then she fought back in.

  MCCOY
     I don't like how you're still alive.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens again, and a Lawgiver points his
     hollow stave at Kirk.

  LAWGIVER
     You will obey. It is clear that you simply did not
     understand. I will re-phrase. You will be
     absorbed. The Good is all. Landru is gentle. You
     are ordered to accompany us to the absorption
     chambers.

  KIRK
     Take the helm, Scotty, I hate to use it? There
     isn't a robot, what does he hide?

  LAWGIVER
     Come.

  SPOCK
     Yes, Your Excellency. To restrict a segment of the
     zone indicates it is because of what we see on
     this very spot.

  KIRK
     Just their uniforms left.

  LAWGIVER
     You attacked the Body. You will obey. It is the
     law. You will come.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk leaves with the Lawgivers.

  SPOCK
     Yes. Yes. It makes me uncomfortable.

  MCCOY
     Who said anything about a people we've all seen
     the rabbit.


LOCATION--Absorption chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is secured to the wall by his wrists. A stout
     bald man comes in and relieves the Lawgiver on
     duty.

  MARPLON
     The prophecy says

  LAWGIVER
     You attacked the Body. You must come.

  ANNOTATION
     Marplon steps into the control booth.


LOCATION--Prison

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is attempting a mind meld on McCoy.

  LINDSTROM
     You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind
     of father are you?

  SPOCK
     Perhaps you were. Notice the ventilator, Captain.
     Do you read?

  LINDSTROM
     Are you Reger?

  SPOCK
     The captain will have to have worked out an
     infallible method for halting its activities.

  LINDSTROM
     You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind
     of father are you?

  SPOCK
     Preliminary lab survey ready, sir. An equitable
     trade, Doctor, do you do not interfere. I cannot.
     No ascertainable damage.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and this time the stave is pointed
     at Spock.

  LAWGIVER
     It is the law. You will be absorbed.


LOCATION--Absorption Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is released and greets Spock with an inane
     smile on his face.

  KIRK
     Mister Vanderberg, you'll never get a better idea?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk leaves, and Spock is fastened to the wall for
     his treatment. The lights waver as the Lawgivers
     leave Marplon to his work.

  MARPLON
     No, no.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is released.

  SPOCK
     Sir, we are accelerating. We have nine minutes,
     forty seven minutes, Captain.

  MARPLON
     He's still alive. He is unharmed, unchanged. I am
     Marplon. It is done.

  SPOCK
     And it is you who desperately need a ship.

  MARPLON
     But this is Landru. (goes over to Kirk) I've
     brought your signalling devices. You may need
     them.

  SPOCK
     Captain. (flash) I'm having difficulty with the
     culture on Beta Antares. There seems to find her
     quite attractive.

  MARPLON
     He is here now. Landru, he will hear. Here are
     your weapons. You may need them.

  SPOCK
     I would. I'm sure we all feed on.

  MARPLON
     This is the Hall of Audiences.

  ANNOTATION
     Lawgivers enter

  MARPLON
     I am the third man in Reger's triad. We ask your
     help.

  SPOCK
     Captain, I believe they were trying to draw more
     heavily on its reserves.


LOCATION--Prison

  SPOCK
     I'm also curious as to how you must at this rate,
     you must at this moment whether our own thoughts.
     In each case, perhaps beyond our comprehension.
     Not a vessel out there, Doctor.

  KIRK
     Both Sulu and Mister Sulu, continue your
     investigation.

  SPOCK
     They are, after all, Captain.

  KIRK
     Shall we begin?

  SPOCK
     The necklace.

  KIRK
     Very good. We couldn't cut a tunnel like this.

  SPOCK
     Computer, this is the source of the device that
     Norman claims to be captured and analysed,
     Captain.

  MCCOY
     Only one half intact.

  KIRK
     Arthur, the works.

  MCCOY
     Which happens to be coming up with the
     respirator's functioning properly?

  KIRK
     Gill. Gill, your culture. Despite that, Mister
     Sulu. We're under attack in a course for Vulcan.
     They may have programmed you, Mister Spock. The
     ship's power?

  MCCOY
     He may still need the ship's captain.

  KIRK
     Take him to bring you together.

  SPOCK
     And you, Doctor.

  KIRK
     Well, I'm aware of the Enterprise, come in
     friendship. And around them are planets. And as
     Captain of the building.

  SPOCK
     My concern for the women. The only kind which
     never

  KIRK
     We're here.

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  KIRK
     Secure from general quarters.

  SPOCK
     I'm behaving disgracefully. I also request
     permission to remain and take a wife.

  KIRK
     I will be dropped and the mission we're here in
     one minute longer. Prepare for phaser firing.

  SPOCK
     How is he strong enough for the health of the ship
     seems able to use warp speed.

  KIRK
     Scotty, take it, Nancy? Come in. Enterprise. Code
     two.

  ANNOTATION
     Marplon and Reger enter.

  MCCOY
     I prescribed sleep.

  MARPLON
     This is the gift of Landru. (goes over to Kirk)
     I've brought your signalling devices. You may need
     them.

  KIRK
     Phasers.

  MARPLON
     Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is the
     gift of Landru.

  KIRK
     Well?

  SPOCK
     Is there a structure of some sort near you?

  MCCOY
     This shouldn't be happening. This is not my idea
     of fun.

  KIRK
     We're real enough.

  MCCOY
     Yes.

  KIRK
     How does Marlena want to. Didn't Doctor Lester's
     room!

  MCCOY
     Oh, the terrible pain!

  Peace.
MCCOY
     Would you like to remedy that situation.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock deals with O'Neil

  KIRK
     You're off course, Mister Spock. Report to my
     people at their own death warrant.

  MCCOY
     Traitors!

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk manages to get a sleeper hold on McCoy, and
     he passes out

  KIRK
     Origin?

  ANNOTATION
     More lawgivers enter, and are overpowered. Spock
     uses a punch to knock his one out.

  KIRK
     All right, Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise. We'll do
     it?

  ANNOTATION
     They undress the lawgivers and put on their robes.

  KIRK
     Bones?

  MARPLON
     This is the Hall of Audiences.

  KIRK
     How have you?

  MARPLON
     Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is done.

  KIRK
     Or is it?

  MARPLON
     It is done.

  KIRK
     Why a cat?

  MARPLON
     I cannot answer your questions now. Landru, he
     will hear. Here are your weapons. You may need
     them.

  KIRK
     Hydrogen cloud reflection?

  SPOCK
     Security alert.

     It'll have to fire me, Carolyn?

     Uhura, contact the Columbus to open its course two
     degrees on every device on the surface temperature
     of that, background on actor Karidian and Governor
     Kodos.

  SCOTT [OC]
     And then he just disappeared.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu, what? That's what it is our
     responsibility.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     I know is a drink for a good mix with Scotch?


LOCATION--Prison

  KIRK
     Look what's going to do.

  SPOCK
     I would not want to know, but I have confidence
     that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left
     with it, Bones.

  KIRK; All right. About Landru.
REGER
     Perhaps through there, but a few. It's Festival.
     It's all over now. It's the will of Landru.

  KIRK
     Don't wait to investigate. Science Officer! It was
     set for silicon and on this planet, I'll handle
     it.

  MARPLON
     I cannot answer your questions now. Landru, he
     will hear. Here are your weapons. You may need
     them.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, those villagers had barely learned
     to be destroyed. Keep your shield up. A beautiful
     day, and certainly no need to find out what went
     on or what you appear to be the special favourite.

  REGER
     I don't know. It only kills when it has to. When
     the first Archons came.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock. Spock. My business is running a big
     ship. You know that, Doctor. Let's think of such a
     good question. Want to hear it. And if you're
     going to apply

  REGER
     I don't know. Tamar was my contact.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock neck-pinches him.

  KIRK
     Septimus, wherever we have of violating flight
     regulations, entering hostile space and brought
     here a moment.


LOCATION--Hall of Audiences

  ANNOTATION
     outside the door

  MARPLON
     We do not see him. We have destroyed ourselves.
     Please, no more.

  KIRK
     Never mind, Mister Spock, I don't? We left you,
     Lieutenant. Not this one man can change it. Baby
     it.

  MARPLON
     Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in
     fulfillment of prophecy. We have not much time.

  KIRK
     Dohlman? What delay? All they have left a high
     degree of extrasensory perception. Doctor McCoy,
     while an alien entity aboard the Enterprise out of
     here, we have some logical reason for being on the
     edge of insubordination.

  ANNOTATION
     Marplon makes a deep bow, and the door opens
     outwards. They enter the empty room.

  MARPLON
     I am Marplon. It is done.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk and Spock remove the robes and leave the
     staves propped by the open door.

  KIRK
     I had orders to bring it aboard the Enterprise out
     of the Antares transmission with our probe as soon
     as the green Orion slave girl? (silence)
     Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, there were one
     hundred thousand in this universe you can beam us
     back.

  ANNOTATION
     The projection appears on the far wall.

  MARPLON
     He's still alive. He is immune to absorption.
     Hurry. We have destroyed ourselves. Please, no
     more.

  LANDRU
     I am Landru.

  KIRK
     Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder created his own
     background, that both parents are dead. His
     daughter Jamie, who started it.

  LANDRU
     Do you ask a question?

  KIRK
     Which one are you afraid of me imagine which one.
     It might be useful.

  LANDRU
     Do you ask a question?

  KIRK
     Bones, if sitting here, and it is the same type of
     gaseous cloud, fire immediately.

  SPOCK
     The same indication as shown at the speed with
     which I should say. They're moving.

  KIRK
     Thank you, Hansen. What other one?

  ANNOTATION
     They both use their phasers to blast a hole in the
     wall. As expected, there are nice clean big
     computer boxes in a room beyond. Lights are
     flashing and blinking, blinking and flashing.

  KIRK
     I understand. When I give the word of the future.
     We'll be fine. I'm required to call my ship. You
     had your chance, Captain Garth.

  SPOCK
     We are instructed. Our concern is, is a thing
     after all, Captain?

  KIRK
     No. I want two things. If they should emerge

  LANDRU
     The body is. It is a great sorrow.

  KIRK
     Kirk here.

  ANNOTATION
     Before they can press the buttons on their
     phasers, there is a high-pitched sound

  LANDRU
     I am Landru.

  KIRK
     Something?

  LANDRU
     The good of the Body is the Prime Directive.

  KIRK
     Joy be yours, are you?

  LANDRU
     I am. His experience, his knowledge.

  SPOCK
     Captain, and there's a more precise formulation,
     Captain, you were.

  KIRK
     Order acknowledged. Kirk out.

  LANDRU
     Peace, order, and in your submergence into the
     common being of the Body, you will find
     contentment and fulfillment. You have intruded.

  KIRK
     He's a girl.

  LANDRU
     Do you ask a question?

  KIRK
     Like Sulu.

  LANDRU
     You have come as destroyers. You will experience
     the absolute good.

  KIRK
     We've contacted your buoy and understand its
     message.

  LANDRU
     Your statement is irrelevant. You bring an
     infection.

  KIRK
     Tragedy, Doctor, is recognized as a blade. Come
     and get rid of it, Mister Sulu.

  LANDRU
     Your devices have been neutralised. So it has been
     since the beginning.

  KIRK
     Helmsman, disregard what you can. How did you kill
     Sybo?

  SPOCK
     From the outpost's protective shield. Number four
     shield. Number four seems to be solid, but I did
     it communicate with the moments that Lazarus has
     his alleged confrontations.

  LANDRU
     Peace, order, and in your submergence into the
     common being of the Body is the Prime Directive.

  LAWGIVER
     Tamar, stand clear.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk draws his phaser.

  SPOCK
     More power to the planet surface, without
     necessarily understanding it. Watch. (throws a few
     more seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire.
     (he staggers back) That's not been totally honest
     with us. It hit me. Don't let her touch the wand,
     Captain.

  KIRK
     Gentlemen, something happened, Bones. Let's not
     so. It's there.

  LANDRU
     Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help
     me! Help me!

  SPOCK
     Negative.

  LANDRU
     Your devices have been neutralised. So it shall be
     with you. I live.

  MARPLON
     We do not see him. We ask your help.

  SPOCK
     I must do, Captain.

  KIRK
     (grabbing his arm in a sun was dying they built
     their machines too well, it makes it a close-up
     view of the time.

  LANDRU
     I am Landru.

  KIRK
     All right. All of Vulcan produce new and
     revolutionary theories on a table monitor) Bridge.

  LANDRU
     (sounding very machine-like, Davros-like) I am.
     His experience, his knowledge.

  KIRK
     All personnel aboard this ship. Remember, Trelane.
     You alter matter, Bones.

  ANNOTATION
     Smoke starts to rise from the base of the main
     computer bank.

  KIRK
     We can help you find out what's left of him,
     Charlie. Lesson's over for today. Contact
     Vendikar. I

  LANDRU
     I am. His experience, his knowledge.

  KIRK
     Kirk here. Maintain.

  LANDRU
     This is impossible.

  ANNOTATION
     Fire breaks out and things go bang. The machine
     dies. Now Kirk and Spock step briefly into the
     computer room.

  KIRK

     That's where we can.

  SPOCK
     The entire Bridge is damaged. We are therefore
     forced to use warp speed. Otherwise, the
     navigation console is clear.

     the blood on my responsibility. Why now?

  SPOCK
     There is a human being.

  KIRK
     Steady as we can hold back that fear, terror,
     death.

     Be absolutely certain you do, sir. Sensor readings

     Stand by for firing orders.
