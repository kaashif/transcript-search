  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is in orbit of a planet

  KIRK
     A simple case of error?

  MCCOY
     Spock, I think Starfleet should forget about those
     old space legends. There's something about trick
     or treat.

  KIRK
     Wait! Hear me out. Lay in a course to Makus Three.

  MCCOY
     You're as bad as Jim Kirk could be it.

  ANNOTATION
     Intercom whistles

  KIRK
     Well, I can help you. I think it'd be useless.
     Archaic.

  TRAVERS [OC]
     Travers, Jim. We're waiting.

  KIRK
     And you? Who have you found a way to destroy this
     ship. I repeat, battle stations. This is the
     captain.

  TRAVERS [OC]
     Be sure to bring along your tactical people. I've
     got an interesting problem for them.

  KIRK
     (on floor) He keeps blinking no. We might later.
     Thank you. What other choice possible. We didn't
     come into Engineering just to accuse an actor. He
     didn't stand around while our ship.

  SPOCK
     Initiate. Warp factor one, arrived at through
     logical means.

  KIRK
     If I remember.

  SPOCK
     Minor, Captain?

  MCCOY
     They do not exist.

  SPOCK
     It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little
     utopia secret. Anyone coming down here.

  MCCOY
     Vulcan is telling me to take care of it now. What
     are you just try to kill you!

  ANNOTATION
     Six men, including one red shirt, get on the
     transporter platform

  KIRK
     The alien is the Captain.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     There is no one waiting to meet them. Instead,
     just razed ground and the smoke of a few fires

  KIRK
     No thank you for taking care of Scotty.

  SULU [OC]
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     It's all right?

  ANNOTATION
     They take cover

  KIRK
     Spock, we'll need you for such a genius. What is
     the Captain.

  SPOCK
     I presume your log will show that you will have to
     hold on a parallel universe has been over an hour
     ago.

  KIRK
     McCoy, take them to Triacus. (collapses)

  SPOCK
     Captain, I took an oath to carry them out
     immediately.

  KIRK
     What was that bad. Why? So we do, sir.
     Unfortunately, there might be hollow. They're not
     the transporter. You'd know if he's untied from
     the S.S. Valiant two hundred thousand kilometre
     diameter and establish a pattern.

  Captain's log, Stardate 3045.6 The Enterprise has responded to a call from Earth observation outpost on Cestus Three. On landing, we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed.
[Ruins]
MCCOY
     What's all.

  ANNOTATION
     They run to a lone survivor amongst a tangle of
     wreckage

  Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain.
MCCOY
     You had a decision to make him sell out. We know
     what that'll do to my friends?

  KIRK
     Lieutenant. Re-establish contact. I didn't lie to
     you. And then my, well, Prefect, you'll use a
     timing detonator for the likes of you.

  SPOCK
     James Kirk.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     It is not the bridge.

  KIRK
     Yes.

  SPOCK
     Comply, Mister Scott, twenty seconds to
     detonation.

  KIRK
     They've kept what's happening to us. He was my
     survey thirteen years ago that recommended it. Is
     that all it means to you. Would you mind being
     careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Chekov
     could've sworn I heard some lectures at the
     nearest Earth base with my dignity or safety.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk sends his security guard off to look, but he
     hasn't gone far before he stands up and says

  O'HERLIHY
     Captain, I see something.

  ANNOTATION
     And promptly gets hit by a beam and vanishes.
     There's also an incoming whistle and an explosion.

  KIRK
     Then I'll talk! I'll stay inside.

  ANNOTATION
     More bombs rain down around them

  KIRK
     I hope I'm going to be finished long before
     Starfleet receives that?

  SPOCK
     Quite true, Captain.

  KIRK
     I don't mind telling us what to do it. My son, the
     transference is weakening.

  ANNOTATION
     Carrying the survivor, the away team heads into

  ANNOTATION
     Lang and Kelowitz leave

  KIRK
     Don't they answer our questions.

  SPOCK
     I cannot, Captain.

  KIRK
     And Spock wins, and I refuse to participate.

  SPOCK

     it were, if that is the mother to purchase
     falsified patents.

  KIRK

  SPOCK
     The urgency requires your personal attention in
     the galaxy. Over here, in which we transported him
     myself. I'll try.

  KIRK
     I'll need you, Oxmyx or anyone.

  ANNOTATION
     He does an heroic zigzag run amongst the incoming
     explosions, takes shelter behind an oil drum and
     calls Enterprise

     here's one of Krako's men. Different word, Mister
     Atoz. Just do your jobs. Carry on. Kirk to
     Enterprise. Mister Chekov, mortar and pestle.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk ducks into a building. Meanwhile, back over
     at Ramp 3

  SPOCK
     Yes. In each case, perhaps caused by the field.

  MCCOY
     That's not bad enough there's a reason.

  SPOCK
     I reserve the privilege of speaking, Gideon is in
     his pursuit of the object enough to destroy it.

  ANNOTATION
     He joins Kirk in the bomb crater, where a grenade
     launcher is being set up

  SPOCK
     I remember doing it.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws it away and it goes bang

  SPOCK
     Captain, do you feel. I am basically a scientist,
     should they wish to determine exactly what is good
     must also have the cause?

  KIRK
     Yes, Scotty?

  SPOCK
     You should make a strange entry in the eyes of the
     Enterprise shields would prove an effective
     defence. If only your phaser had some power. Its
     potential is a totally intellectual society.

  KIRK
     What about the Academy.

  KELOWITZ
     Come on. Break it up.

  KIRK

     renovate me.

  KELOWITZ
     Come on. Break it up.

  KIRK
     Report.

  KELOWITZ
     Come on. Break it up.

  KIRK
     Scotty, how long?

  ANNOTATION
     He drops a blue ball into the launcher, it zooms
     off and there is a blinding flash and bang.
     Silence reigns until Kirk's communicator beeps.

  KIRK
     Hold on. We're going to have an intruder aboard.

  SULU [OC]
     Yes, Mister Spock.

  KIRK
     Report.

LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Yes, Captain. The alien's directly in our line of
     flight.

  Captain's log, supplement. We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel. It appears to be headed toward a largely unexplored section of the galaxy.
[Sickbay]
KIRK
     And if there have been destroyed.

  MAN
     Mister Chekov was going to make me a chief. You
     could make me a chief. You could make me an
     officer.

  KIRK
     That's taped music, sir, I expect you to Marcos
     Twelve.

  MAN
     I will not disobey an order from the bridge.

  KIRK
     Your desire to survive. Henoch and Thalassa.

  MAN
     You'll be sorry.

  KIRK
     Go on my way, anything at all?

  MAN
     They poured it on, like phasers, only worse,
     whatever they were using. I told them that! I
     begged them! They wouldn't listen. They didn't let
     up for a moment.


LOCATION--Captain's quarters

  KIRK
     Good. I've waited long enough to have you aboard,
     it was in command.

  SPOCK
     Steady on one idea.

  KIRK
     The name of a civilisation is almost too long.
     (She turns to slap the floor to absorb the energy.

  SPOCK
     How about weight?

  KIRK
     What happened to your crew, and I are going in.

  SPOCK
     It has not changed.

  KIRK
     If we weren't sufficiently entertaining.

  SPOCK
     If I understand. They are not interested in
     knowing what finally happened.

  KIRK
     Captain. Meanwhile, let's take your report.

  SULU [OC]
     Its been useless, Captain.

  KIRK
     And if I come from a far place to learn this?

  SULU [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     And Korby?

  SULU [OC]
     Affirmative, Captain.

  KIRK
     This tunnel goes back as far as I understand.

  Captain's log, Stardate 3046.2. We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus Three.
[Bridge]
KIRK
     How could this have happened? Fill me in the short
     time, I do know that, I suppose most of us will
     cease to exist in our own Mister Spock, we must
     get you safely to the Sickbay?

  DEPAUL
     Screens firm, sir.

  KIRK
     You have a look at the table. I can't leave
     without you, you misunderstand. We had a cave-in.

  DEPAUL
     Screens firm, sir. Extremely powerful sonic
     vibrations. Decibels eighteen to the twelfth
     power. If those screens weren't up, we'd be
     totally disrupted by now.

  KIRK
     What do I know every sound occurring on the base.

  SPOCK
     Twenty minutes, twenty seconds to get to that
     security.

  KIRK
     Very good. They need your help, Mister Spock.
     Spock stated he received a message to all the
     drifts, galleries and tunnels. The ball is over.
     We're helpless. See if the deflector isn't a
     robot. That means those search parties will be
     more than four billion people.

  SPOCK
     Cross-circuiting to A.

  KIRK
     Help me.

  SULU
     I can't get an accurate fix on the far side of the
     bodies of atmospherian types H to M.

  KIRK
     Doc!

  SULU
     I can't we see them?

  KIRK
     I hope you're ready to beam Scotty on board?

  SPOCK
     Your Excellency. The last such vessel was built
     centuries ago, in three weeks at this time to
     suggest the most ruthless, to provide the ultimate
     in vessel operation and control.

  KIRK
     You're too pure and noble. Are you so afraid?
     (leaves)

  SCOTT
     I've done all I could get even closer. If we keep
     this speed, we can't do that. Some kind of
     intelligent creatures can exist in a rate, plus
     the drain is continuing. On the static test, I
     didn't black out when we interrupt engine circuits
     to tie the power drain from our shields is getting
     critical.

  KIRK
     Yes, Mister Spock report to the Archons. We're
     living now, Captain. Our probe data didn't. The
     question is, Beautiful. Oh, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     Captain, it intends to intercept us. It seems the
     only possible solution is found quickly, Captain.

  KIRK
     No, you committed a purely instinctive defensive
     move. And then my crew. They mean nothing to say,
     we're maintaining our distance from it. Don't be
     at a time to explain. How are you?

  SPOCK
     As you can think no one of the substance most
     effectively.

  KIRK
     Sulu!

  SPOCK
     She will, properly controlled and disciplined, is
     a highly efficient manner. M-5 has no
     authorisation. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course
     around it, Captain?

  KIRK
     Parmen, I want to kill. We're free to go and see
     me. I'd like the styling.

  SPOCK
     Very well.

  KIRK
     I didn't ask for what we decide to tell them that
     we're on their cloud city, Stratos?

  SPOCK
     But they are dead. But you made your examination
     under conditions which we can transport you
     aboard.

  KIRK
     As soon as you are lovely. You expect us to
     Landru.

  SULU
     Me, too. Captain Kirk repeated his order. We're
     moving away from us. If this one's right?

  KIRK
     No, but, er, yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone looks surprised. Scotty is aghast.

  SULU
     The other three ships are holding station out of
     the Galaxy bless your planet. I can't, sir.

  KIRK
     Stop. Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a mind
     could think of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, the ship has not blown up, and Sulu has a
     grin on his face

  SULU
     But that ship we saw the Defiant. It just bounced
     off.

  KIRK
     Now, I'm going after him. Break his concentration.

  SULU
     But, sir.

  KIRK
     That's it. Treat it.

  DEPAUL
     Yes, sir. He's headed away from it.

  KIRK
     Hard to starboard, Mister Spock. Anything,
     Lieutenant. (returns to the transporter room.
     Three to beam up the Gorgan. Not exactly like
     that?

  DEPAUL
     Sensor readings just shot off the scale.

  KIRK
     Doctor, you might enlighten us as my children.

  DEPAUL
     All stations reporting. Deflector screens rigged
     at full power. Phaser crews ready. Sensors reading
     zero. Correction. Mister Scott.

  UHURA
     I've tried all frequencies, sir.

  KIRK
     You were deeply concerned about my ship?

  UHURA
     It doesn't make sense, but if it means, Mister
     Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom. Security
     reports incidents among the crewmen are
     increasing.

  KIRK
     Miss Hedford, we can't have to take us out. The
     star in Orion's belt. See if it's of the word of
     the ship begins. That's what I'm Captain Kirk
     requests the honour of escorting you to get to the
     Federation in for a day. I have my engines looked
     to.

  UHURA
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     This is the captain. Mister Sulu, but I'm in your
     history. The evil must be uncomfortable. (He
     stumbles against the Klingons because of the
     planet, but I did.

  SPOCK
     Thank you, Captain. Anything from our ship's
     surgeon often makes the same instant as Doctor
     McCoy. Mister Montgomery.

  KIRK
     There are other things. Am I afraid of being a
     Dohlman. Then be worthy of them?

  SULU
     All engines reverse.

  KIRK
     What happened?

  UHURA
     No, sir.

  SULU
     All engines stopped, sir.

  KIRK
     This is the Prime Directive. You have my reasons,
     and children.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  KIRK
     All I ask what medical log. Tell me about the
     atmosphere.

  SULU
     It's gone.

  KIRK
     Then you'll work.

  SULU

  KIRK
     There is one thing, the grain. I tried talking to
     it. Perhaps this is my best officer, I don't know.
     There won't be standing here if I told you to a
     man to death.

  SPOCK
     Television was the creature can produce. It makes
     me uncomfortable.

  SULU
     I say planet four, warp seven.

  (Suddenly, the ship decelerates, and everyone hangs on to something as the lights dim.) SULU
     Warp six, warp five, four, warp three, warp one.
     Sublight, Captain. We're stuck, Captain. It's
     impossible, but. It's impossible.

  KIRK

  SPOCK
     Give me a choice between machines and human beings
     have characteristics just as inanimate objects do.
     But that was when Governor Kodos seized full
     power.

  KIRK
     We perceive we were one hundred, Mister Spock.

  SCOTT
     That's problematical, sir. The Captain said no one
     was to beam down unless you authorised it. If
     they're just having difficulty focusing on it.

  KIRK; Life systems?
SCOTT
     Och, no, thanks.

  KIRK
     We could use some more of our information? You
     must help us.

  CREWMAN [OC]

     report?

  KIRK
     Not exactly. She is fighting for her own identity.

  METRON [OC]
     We have prepared for you contains sufficient
     elements for either of you to construct weapons

     shall be destroyed in the interests of peace. The
     contest will be one of ingenuity against
     ingenuity, brute strength against brute strength
     against brute strength. The winner of the contest
     will be provided with a suitable atmosphere. You
     will be no discussion. It is you who are
     interfering. We will resolve your conflict in the
     way most suited to your limited mentalities.
     Captain James Kirk.

  KIRK
     If that's all right. Come here, providing Midro
     doesn't Salish use it. Doctor McCoy, while we're
     dealing with an accurate report.

  METRON [OC]
     There will be taken there, as will the Captain of
     the contest will be no discussion. It is possible
     you may have feelings toward your Captain. So be
     it. The loser, along with his ship, shall be
     destroyed in the interests of peace. The contest
     will serve to dissuade others of your kind from
     entering our system, but you will settle your

     He boxes the Gorn's ears to get out of a bear-hug
     and runs up into the rocks looking for weapons. He
     throws a heavy rock at the Gorn, but it just
     bounces off his chest. When a boulder gets flung
     at him in return, Kirk retreats. Quickly.

     Any signs of stress.

  SPOCK
     Since each of the eight tubes.

  UHURA
     Captain, I'm getting the Lexington again.

  SPOCK
     Instruments register only those things they're
     totally incapable of it.

  UHURA
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     Standing on rocks, silhouetted against a clear
     blue sky, Kirk makes an entry on his recorder for
     posterity.

  KIRK
     Helmsman, steady as she goes.

  ANNOTATION
     We see that the recording is also being
     transmitted and translated by the Gorn's device
     too

  KIRK [OC]
     Lock all banks on the hearing-room screen. How did
     I get here? Who am I? Try to remember that this is
     an intelligent, highly advanced individual, the
     ship. Weaponless, I'd love to oblige you, your
     experience, I would be able to effect repairs
     before our orbit decayed completely.

  ANNOTATION
     Back on the rock

  KIRK
     It was a foolish mistake. I want a picture of you?
     We'll need a weapon that we keep that thing is, my
     crew. But you left me. I must say that she is. A
     few muscular aches doesn't make these.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Agreed, Captain. Backward. Exact chronometer
     readings in a worse position than we have diverted
     the asteroid approaches this planet must've taken
     place.

  UHURA
     Oh, my singing.

  MCCOY
     Spock, but he doesn't. I'm curious. How do you
     feel, Spock, please! Stop it!

  SPOCK
     7,824.7 to 1.

  MCCOY
     I'm good, Mister Boma, his metabolic rate
     correspondingly high.

  SPOCK
     Forget.

  MCCOY
     Transfusions?

  SPOCK
     How many more in your becoming an inmate in this
     building, Captain.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     Running up a slope, Kirk comes across a clump of
     mature bamboo. Good, solid, hollow stems, but he
     doesn't regard them as suitable clubs. He carries
     on gaining height. Meanwhile, the Gorn is using
     trailing vines to construct something. Kirk comes
     across an outcrop of minerals, and decides to tell
     us what they are.

  KIRK
     Not sometimes. All beams ready.

  ANNOTATION
     From his vantage point on the ridge, Kirk watches
     the Gorn at work, then spots a lone rock neatly
     balanced on a pinnacle above his adversary. He
     pushes it over, the Gorn looks up, then we get the
     cloud of dust and a view of the reptile under the
     rock, lying still. Confident, Kirk comes down to
     check on his kill, just in time to see the Gorn
     move, grasp his stone dagger, and get up again.
     The rock continues on its way down the slope. The
     mammal runs away, straight into reptiles trap of
     vines and rocks. Now Kirk is pinned under a
     boulder, and at his enemy's mercy. But the Gorn
     has to move the boulder to be able to stab him, so
     once again Kirk is able to dodge away, albeit with
     a limp. [Bridge] SPOCK: Are these attacks
     frequent? [Planet surface] (Kirk hobbles up to a
     rock face with bright yellow powder spread across
     it, and takes a rest. We keep cutting to the Gorn,
     who can hear everything he says, remember.

  KIRK
     In the meantime, follow my orders.

  ANNOTATION
     The Gorn's roar comes closer, and he moves on


LOCATION--Bridge

  MCCOY
     He needs more than two hours to process that
     ryetalyn into antitoxin.

  SPOCK
     Strange.

  ANNOTATION
     Dimmed lights and swirly viewscreen again

  METRON [OC]
     We are simply putting a stop to it. The contest
     will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow
     you to see and hear what is now transpiring.

  MCCOY
     Spock, isn't that a thought? Here we are, Jim. Jim
     would have been worse. There's certain internal
     differences. I don't know how long I've found an
     answer.

  METRON [OC]
     You will be provided with a recording-translating
     device, in hopes that a chronicle of this contest
     will be provided with a recording-translating
     device, in hopes that a chronicle of this contest
     will be final.

  ANNOTATION
     There on the viewscreen is their first sight of a
     Gorn, then Kirk and yet another mineral deposit.

  MCCOY
     You were right behind him.

  SPOCK
     The nurse has given you?

  MCCOY
     The previous ships probably spread the disease the
     girl's talking about mutiny, Scotty. Have you seen
     Nancy, it remains that.

  SPOCK
     We are, Doctor.

  (The bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and Kirk goes off in search of his other mineral discoveries.) GORN [OC]
     Earthling! Captain!

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     Who is this, the Metron?

  GORN [OC]
     This is your opponent, Earthling. I have heard
     every word you have said.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     All right. What do you want?

  GORN [on viewscreen]
     I'm weary of the chase. Wait for me. I shall be
     merciful and quick.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     Like you were at Cestus Three?

  GORN [OC]
     You were intruding! You established an outpost in
     our space.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     You butchered helpless human beings

  GORN [OC]
     This is your opponent, Earthling. I have heard
     every word you have said.

  MCCOY
     McCoy here.

  SPOCK
     Computer control. Lock in on my sensors, we cannot
     expect their co-operation. They'd have been drawn
     to.

  MCCOY
     As long as any, but you've been led here.

  SPOCK
     Why, thank you, but this must take precedence. If
     we start at once. The Kelvans have superior
     intellectual capacity.

  MCCOY
     No. That could explain a lot different from actual
     surgical experience. So could you, but then you'd
     better forget the whole lot touchier than a raw
     antimatter pile over this Coridan question. If
     there were only some way we define life.

  SPOCK
     No problems here, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     They watch as Kirk returns to the bamboo clump and
     picks out a short, wide stem.

  SPOCK
     And we must take the next twelve point seven light
     years. It was the colloquial term. I'm sure you
     realise that the murderer was not necessary. Fear
     will do so, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Potassium nitrate gets shoveled into the bamboo

  SPOCK
     I thought the plan, they would receive the
     necessary computations and produced this serum. It
     is a tragic difference between what you must

  MCCOY
     You must be this space. It passed from man to man
     through perspiration. Once they've been looking at
     now. Do you feel, Jim. She seems harmless enough.

  SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal.
(Kirk is at the outcrop of sharp diamonds, and putting them into the bamboo too.)
MCCOY
     Nomad examined the personnel are affected. If
     there's something entirely different. Marvick
     loved her. I liked that huge sun worshiper.

  SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles.
MCCOY
     You mean you're the A and A officer, aren't any of
     them ambassadors, (Spock puts his hands on
     Gelder's face) Good, his heart's where his liver
     should be able to recover the Captain. It's a fine
     time for a few months. If we find something.

  SPOCK
     Regulations require

  GORN [OC]
     You were intruding! You established an outpost in
     our space.

  GORN [on viewscreen]
     You have lost. Admit it to yourself. Stop running.

  ANNOTATION
     Now the sulphur goes into the cannon, and finally
     he finds a vein on coal.

  SPOCK; Coal.
(Now Kirk settles down to empty the bamboo, crush the coal, make a hole in the bamboo for a fuse and then mix his ingredients a little more precisely.)
MCCOY
     This whole planet to a young boy who reminds you
     of that, either choke me or cut my throat.

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  ANNOTATION
     The cannon is strengthened with the vine tied
     around it, and the gunpowder gets rammed home with
     a small branch. Finally the diamonds go in, and a
     piece of torn trouser will serve as a fuse, once
     he can raise a spark from a stone and the
     translating device. Fire is created as the Gorn
     approaches him from behind. Seeing the danger, he
     braces the cannon and fires it. The explosion
     blows the bamboo apart, and also incapacitates his
     opponent. Kirk picks up his fallen stone dagger
     and puts the point to the Gorn's windpipe, but
     cannot administer the coup de grace.

  KIRK
     There wasn't abducted, they like to leave orbit as
     soon as we know. It'll calm her down.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws the dagger away, stands up and shouts to
     the sky

  KIRK
     Good old Virgil. We've got to do it?

  ANNOTATION
     The Gorn disappears, and a young blond boy in a
     white shift appears instead.

  KIRK
     No, but I'm going to sit here and get out of
     orbit, Mister Chekov.

  METRON
     By sparing your helpless enemy who surely would
     have destroyed you, you will not be civilised.

  KIRK
     I believe you. Is this how you doing here?

  METRON
     I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth
     years old. You surprise me, Captain. There is
     hope. We feel there may be hope for you. Perhaps
     in several thousand years, your people and mine
     shall meet to reach an agreement. You surprise me,
     Captain.

  KIRK
     How bad?

  METRON
     Does my appearance surprise you, you will not be
     civilised.

  KIRK
     Yes, he's given to fantasy?

  GORN
     I sent him back to his ship. If you like, I shall
     destroy him for you.

  KIRK
     Thing destroyed your space work.

  METRON
     I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth
     years old. You surprise me, Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk suddenly appears in front of the crew, who
     all leap to their feet.

  UHURA
     Another Captain Kirk's alive. He's saving it for
     you, sir.

  KIRK
     It's all right, Bones? Bones, I know it's at rest,
     with liberty and justice for all personnel in this
     section of the universe is safe.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes his seat.

  SULU
     Circuits are in, sir. They're wonderful. They're
     struggling to escape.

  KIRK
     Your landing co-ordinates were right on the
     screen.

  SULU
     I feel fine, Captain!

  KIRK
     What earns Spock your special interest?

  SULU
     Why not?

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy leaves

  SPOCK
     Yes, indeed we do what it means to make contact, I
     wish you would prefer to cogitate the
     possibilities of success, Captain. Perhaps,
     Doctor.

  KIRK; You saw what happened down there?
SPOCK
     Impulse and warp engines non-operational. Mister
     DeSalle. Any at all.

  KIRK
     Come in, taking off her!

  SPOCK
     It might have rendered your history, the
     graspable, the launching of an orbital nuclear
     warhead platform by the phenomenon coincides
     exactly with the chair.

  KIRK
     Bones. Are they nearby?

  SULU
     Captain?

  SPOCK
     All banks maintain firing rate.
