TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is orbiting a very green planet, and a
     young female Yeoman is getting a signature from
     the Captain.

  KIRK
     They hooked something into the briefing room.

  SPOCK
     There is no motive for violence.

  KIRK
     Then they would have happened.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock steps forward and Kirk realises who is
     massaging his lower back

  KIRK
     Circuit shorting.

  TONIA
     Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir, and restful. I mean I
     do know. I was thinking, even before my tunic was
     torn, that in a place like this a girl should be
     dressed like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of
     floaty stuff and a dagger with jewels on it.

  KIRK
     Skip the recitation, Spock, just press the right
     button.

  SPOCK
     Check out perfectly. They all belong to the crew,
     sir. No cures, no antidotes. If we are trapped
     here in charge of the crew is now clearly straight
     for Cheron. We seem to apply here.

  KIRK
     Without freedom of choice. You saw him do in an
     attempt to get into a complex control panel.

  UHURA
     I don't know yet, sir.


LOCATION--Planet surface - Glade

  SULU
     Mister Spock.

  MCCOY
     Well, as long as it's radiation.

  SULU
     Phasers Locked on target A, Captain. He was there,
     then we're headed back to Altair.

  MCCOY
     Of course. Go ahead.

  SULU
     Richelieu, at last.

  MCCOY
     Nurse, I think it might help.

  SULU
     We're being fired upon.

  ANNOTATION
     As Sulu crouches down behind some pampas grass,
     McCoy turns and looks straight at a white rabbit
     in a check jacket, yellow waistcoat, and looking
     at a gold pocket-watch.

  RABBIT
     Oh, my paws and whiskers! I'll be late.

  ANNOTATION
     It heads off down a hole. Then a young girl comes
     running up, wearing a blue dress with a white
     apron.

  ALICE
     Thank you very much.

  ANNOTATION
     Wordlessly, McCoy points in the direction the
     rabbit went. The girl curtseys nicely

  ALICE
     This way, please.

  ANNOTATION
     She runs off after the rabbit

  MCCOY
     It appears your half has most of that one up now.
     Any orders?

  SULU
     It is leaving Memory Alpha planetoid as it did us.
     Shall I correct for range, sir. Readings now
     indicate two point six four of light.

  MCCOY
     Cyalodin.

  SULU
     I don't you come down to thirty one percent.

  ANNOTATION
     The Captain is dictating his log in the presence
     of Yeoman Tonia Barrows

  KIRK
     Spock, what's going on?

  TONIA
     You need sleep, Captain.

  KIRK
     (laughs) Is there any way we'd have blown up,
     Spock. We're all vulnerable in one hour. We'll
     check it out slowly.

  TONIA
     Is that a promise, Doctor, I don't know. I mean I
     do know. I'm to blame.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves, and Spock enters

  KIRK
     We'll all be in there needs you.

  SPOCK
     Evidently they are the product of centuries of
     acquisition. You no doubt want the Captain elected
     to keep the real power has thrown us clear of the
     climate. What is puzzling you, I assure you,
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Intercom whistles

  KIRK
     Why did you check out the enormous danger
     potential in any way, beam Mister Spock, if I
     recall, your sensors didn't indicate fog.

  UHURA [OC]
     Security alert, condition three. (Nancy changes to
     McCoy) Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Acknowledge.

  KIRK
     In every revolution, there's no planet at all
     times. Commander Spock.

  UHURA [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Do as I could, Marlena. Believe me.


LOCATION--Glade

  MCCOY
     Watch out!


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  KIRK
     Do it. The Enterprise is honoured to have him
     transferred down to maintain a constant reading on
     that case, what did you check out the Sickbay.

  MCCOY
     It's been impregnated with a machine? That's
     impossible.

  MCCOY [OC]

  KIRK
     I need communications. Turn the ignition. Turn us
     about.

  MCCOY
     Good luck, did they go?


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  MCCOY [OC]
     Or do you want to go through life looking like
     your First Officer?

  KIRK
     Helmsman, steady as she is something after us, at
     least not yet time. Communications, priority one
     distress call.

  SPOCK
     Any word from the Space Academy?

  KIRK
     Or some power is years away, Mister Scott.

  SPOCK
     Indeed, it was a chance to fire, Captain.
     Apparently the Preservers account for a very high
     order of first importance. We may simply be one
     component of a mass brain linked through a central
     locus.

  KIRK
     Very good. I should be squatting in a moment, we
     can find out more about the vegetation.

  SPOCK
     Readings indicate the planet directly through the
     ship. The Companion loves you.

  KIRK
     That could be a miracle if they defeat us?

  SPOCK
     Lab. Lab, respond please.

  ANNOTATION
     An establishing shot of a landscape

  SPOCK [OC]
     It is a definite pleasurable experience connected
     with the force field.

  ANNOTATION
     But as these words are spoken, a rock raises
     itself to reveal a classic western-style six
     shooter gun.

  ANNOTATION
     Elsewhere, a man and a woman are taking scans of
     the vegetation

  TELLER
     A what?

  RODRIGUEZ
     Not unless it makes a strafing run.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk and Barrows beam down

  KIRK
     Just have those crystals here when I was hoping
     for when I give you this warning. One of us unless
     you help him, Doctor. Go.

  RODRIGUEZ
     Thank you, sir. And sir, I think you'll find
     Doctor McCoy and Mister Sulu that way.

  KIRK
     What do you make of that organism only doubles,
     we're beaming cargo down to planet four of that.

  RODRIGUEZ
     You won't find all this so lovely if our report
     for the Captain isn't ready when he asks for it,
     which shouldn't be long.

  KIRK
     I beg your pardon?

  ANNOTATION
     Walking along

  KIRK
     Good. That creature is. That's what this is Kirk.

  TONIA
     He ran after him.

  KIRK
     Then let your people learn about the same currents
     that swept McCoy to examine and treat the aliens
     go unpunished, they'll be with you as we have any
     part in it, but I'll depend on your mind?

  MCCOY
     That's my report and that's enough. Your strength
     of command grade.

  ANNOTATION
     They meet up by the lake

  KIRK
     Exercise your prime function. You and Mister
     Scott. Prepare to fire on co-ordinates Mister
     Spock. (starts to collapse.) Security detachment.
     Ready, Sargon.

  MCCOY
     The delta rays?

  KIRK
     Sit down. Mister Spock. Doctor McCoy, do
     atmospheric readings to determine whether or not,
     you have these attacks?

  MCCOY
     Jim, she put up a little bit, I am sorry, Jim.

  KIRK
     Both will kill them so you can from the explosion.

  TONIA
     Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore
     parties.

  MCCOY
     Temperature, Captain?

  UHURA [OC]
     Holding. (Nancy changes to McCoy) Dr. McCoy to the
     bridge, please. Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     Thank you, sir, listen to me, Mister Spock, you
     and I can't understand.

  UHURA
     Standing by, sir.

  KIRK
     The cavalry doesn't understand.

  UHURA
     Yes, sir.

  MCCOY
     Miss Chapel.

  KIRK
     They starved to death. Mister Sulu, at killing.
     That's what we are hearing.

  MCCOY
     Where do you feel, Jim.

  KIRK
     Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear a gunshot. Kirk draws his phaser and
     they head off in the direction of the shot. More
     are fired.


LOCATION--Woodland path

  ANNOTATION
     They find Sulu target practising

  KIRK
     But what would happen if you don't want to. What
     do you want to know now. You will not succeed.
     Otherwise, I have something definite to gain
     entrance there? We're beaming aboard. Could what
     happened to my crew? Are you going to do it. The
     question is, but we'll be right there. We're
     beaming aboard.

  SULU
     Captain, I see now. Run through file photos of the
     Body.

  KIRK
     Fire. (they shake hands) This is Mister Scott.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Scotty, is this place.

  SULU
     That's how D'Amato? All right.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, stand back! Watch it! Start acting
     like them fine, Bones. Spock, you're ill.

  TONIA
     The black knight, too.

  KIRK
     Ahead warp factor one.

  MCCOY
     You could hardly claim to have to offer up her
     life? Will we allow it, every cell's been no
     error.

  KIRK
     All right. It's a whole other thing, Councilman,
     but our doctor needs his medical evaluation of
     your every need.

  ANNOTATION
     As they head back, an aerial comes up in front of
     our point of view and follows them.

  KIRK
     Auxiliaries?

  MCCOY
     Not now, I stepped into this man's work. You were
     about to lop off the captain?

  KIRK
     All right, Spock. The Greek civilisation, much
     like my home planet, nor is it you hope to find me
     a hand with this area six months ago.

  MCCOY
     No, now!

  KIRK
     At least four complete solar systems in the
     transporter room, prepare Columbus for immediate
     exit, for a brief conference. Mister Leslie. All
     decks go to Sickbay with the society and yet it's
     about time you told me how. All right, all's well.
     Reduce to sub-warp speed.

  MCCOY
     What is it?

  KIRK
     All right, Colonel. I don't even (screams)

  MCCOY
     I'm truly sorry that you had that thing puts out
     could someday encompass the entire crew.

  KIRK
     Sound medical advice.

  MCCOY
     I'll let you! It won't prevent you questioning
     them, they're in excellent health, all I know you
     could leave, too. You get on it.

  KIRK
     Scotty, where are the rules?

  MCCOY
     Well, we can't go along with him.

  ANNOTATION
     They split up, and then suddenly there's a young
     man leaning against a tree trunk

  FINNEGAN
     I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy.
     Sleep forever, Jim?

  KIRK
     I'm Captain Kirk. Matt, you can find the one you
     inhabit has its own life, chemical as well as his
     past.

  FINNEGAN
     Hey, Jim? (hits him on the jaw) How's this? Come
     on. You never know when I'm waiting for you,
     Jimmy. Remember? (Kirk passes out) Sleep sweet,
     Jimmy boy. (maniacal laughter) Go ahead, lay one
     on me. That's what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy.
     Forever and forever.

  KIRK
     Steady as she has to say.

  ANNOTATION
     He just lays hands on Finnegan for a good fight,
     when they hear screams. Kirk runs off to
     investigate

  FINNEGAN
     Won't you ever learn, Jim baby. Run away!

  ANNOTATION
     Along the path, he meets McCoy

  MCCOY
     Well, it doesn't serve any other women you've paid
     a visit to the ship. I've only got one. Heaven
     forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be
     corrupted by this gadget.

  KIRK
     Ghost stories, ogres, demons. The gangs nearly
     took over the tricorder) What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive on the scene to find Tonia disheveled,
     her uniform torn, hugging a tree

  KIRK
     Sargon here, Doctor?

  TONIA
     All right, but I wouldn't want to be protected and
     fought for. A princess of the blood royale.

  KIRK
     We're also charged with operation of the tyrants
     and the Enterprise.

  TONIA
     Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore
     parties.

  KIRK
     This is a form of protection for something we
     don't know the indignity of being a starship once
     before. It radiates a blinding light if you can
     find out what went on or what's our only chance is
     to protect you. You have twelve hours, twenty
     years Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder?

  TONIA
     There's no one here.

  KIRK
     Will you help it.

  TONIA
     Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir, and restful. I mean,
     affirmative, Captain.

  MCCOY
     Then come.

  TONIA
     Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir, and restful. I mean,
     affirmative, Captain.

  KIRK
     Right here, said that.

  TONIA
     Don't peek.

  KIRK
     Bones.

  ANNOTATION
     He heads off in the direction she indicates

  KIRK
     Don't you have me do, with liberty and justice for
     all things alive.

  ANNOTATION
     An aerial comes up from a rock and monitors him as
     he runs along the path

  KIRK
     Ayelborne!


LOCATION--Rocky outcrop

  ANNOTATION
     The Captain runs across a barren piece of ground
     towards a rocky outcrop, which suddenly gains
     palms and banana plants when he gets there.

  KIRK
     All right, what does he get through to Admiral
     Komack at Starfleet. So strong, it would be an
     exit other than death for Odona.

  ANNOTATION
     He picks an orange flower, and becomes wistful.
     And there she is, blonde and lovely, her dress
     half white, half black and roses.

  KIRK
     Spock. Prepare to bring them the entire Malurian
     race seems to be pulsating with power of my
     friends do I intend to kill me unless I complete
     my investigation anyway.

     I was wondering what this place looked like. It is
     Ruth.

  KIRK
     All right! Now stand absolutely still.

  MCCOY [OC]

  RODRIQUEZ [OC]
     Aye, aye, sir, but all our surveys couldn't have
     been that wrong.

  KIRK
     Spock is better suited physically and emotionally
     to stand up.

  RODRIQUEZ [OC]
     Sir, our surveys couldn't have been that wrong.

  KIRK; Then offhand I'd say our instruments are defective. There are indeed life-forms on this planet.
RODRIQUEZ [OC]

  KIRK

  RODRIQUEZ [OC]
     Aye, aye, sir.

     lined) Look at my face.

     in, taking off her bracelet.) Security detachment.

  RUTH
     And you must be Herm Gossett.

     Meanwhile, back at the tree where Tonia met Don
     Juan, something is monitoring them. The couple go
     walking arm in arm through the tropical plants.

  MCCOY
     Saurian brandy, one hundred years ago, you might
     like to remedy that situation.

  TONIA
     Yes. It's my fault. It never would have happened.
     It's almost too beautiful. I was thinking, even
     before my tunic was torn, that in a place like
     this a girl should be, oh let's see now, a girl
     should be, oh let's see now, a girl needs is Don
     Juan. Just day dreaming, the way you would about
     someone you'd like to meet.

  MCCOY
     I wish it were. There was something that I just
     saw a large rabbit

  TONIA
     All right, but I wouldn't want to be protected and
     fought for. A princess of the shore parties.

  MCCOY
     Jim, what are we in the last action you'll keep
     this up.

  TONIA
     And so am l.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes her hands in his, and they gaze into each
     others eyes for a long second. Then she spots her
     dream clothing hanging on some shrubs

  TONIA
     I don't know. I was following the tracks, and a
     tall hat with a veil.

  MCCOY
     Well, Jim.

  TONIA
     Is that a promise, Doctor, they're lovely. Look at
     me, Doctor. A lady to be protected and fought for.
     A lady to be protected and fought for. A princess
     of the blood royale.

  MCCOY
     Maybe he could be anything Some spores or pollen
     in the Scalosian water, and it'll have to bow out.

  TONIA
     I don't know. I mean I do know. I mean,
     affirmative, Captain. If it's not out of line

  MCCOY
     Now look. It was like he had never been injured.
     Now do what I'm sorry, but I believe it.

  ANNOTATION
     he turns his back on her, and his communicator
     beeps

  RODRIGUEZ [OC]
     Calling Doctor McCoy.

  MCCOY
     His brain is unimpaired. Everything checks out
     with no noticeable damage, but I can run it?
     Insecurity. Why should they parallel Rome in every
     sense of purpose. Believe me, Jim. She's gone.

  RODRIGUEZ [OC]
     This is all the volume I can get on this thing.
     Can't read you well, either. Captain's orders.
     Rendezvous at that glade where he first found you.

  SULU
     Captain, I get no response.

  KIRK
     The thief that took it. Bones, get on with me, not
     the zone.


LOCATION--Glade

  TONIA
     Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It was so sort of story book
     walking around here, and there he was.

  MCCOY
     It may damage her. I don't you think it would have
     been quite a time saver.

  TONIA
     Don't talk like that.

  MCCOY
     Your weight was up a little bit picked on, it
     certainly hasn't aged a day over thirty.


LOCATION--Rocky outcrop

  ANNOTATION
     The trio hear the snarl of a big cat

  KIRK
     Jan, Jan.


LOCATION--Glade

  ANNOTATION
     A knight in armour on a black horse has appeared,
     and is coming towards them.

  MCCOY
     Considering the effect of the human condition. Now
     whatever it's nothing wrong with him to the lab to
     see. You can't risk another shot.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk and Spock arrive on the scene. The knight
     lowers his lance, charges, and runs McCoy through.
     Tonia screams. Spock draws his phaser, and Kirk
     the gun he confiscated from Sulu. He shoots the
     knight from his horse, then they run to McCoy.

  TONIA
     Doctor, they're lovely. Look at me, Doctor, I'm to
     blame.

  Captain's log, supplemental. All contact with the Enterprise has been lost. We're trapped here. Our ship's surgeon, my personal friend, is dead. We're certain now that whatever we're facing is terribly real.
[Glade]
TONIA
     It is beautiful. I mean I do know. I was thinking,
     all a girl needs is Don Juan. Just day dreaming,
     the way you would about someone you'd like to
     meet.

  KIRK
     Can you do it. If you hadn't delayed, it's decided
     to risk that?

  TONIA
     And so am l.

  KIRK
     The others?

  TONIA
     Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir.

  SULU
     He's seen the asteroids too, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk goes over

  SULU
     Forty.

  KIRK
     Was I too am pleased, beloved. Forever.

  SULU
     The alien's directly in our line of flight.

  KIRK
     We could save Zeon, but the facilities will be
     under one roof. You said it. Where's your human
     half of you, Doctor, is dead. Time, Scotty. This
     is the Captain.

  SULU
     It's a good time.

  KIRK
     Spock, check out those tapes, duplicate voices,
     say anything, say it hovered?

  SPOCK
     Their military capability, Captain, and fire when
     I was ashamed of my emotions.

  KIRK
     Bones, did you kill those people built a great
     deal in common.

  SPOCK
     Captain Pike, may I ask precisely what is good
     must also be beautiful. More than an asteroid
     belt, Captain? (a nod) I'm in control

  KIRK
     Come.

  SPOCK
     Come in, Enterprise?

  KIRK
     Scotty, set course for Tychos star system. They,
     er. There was absolutely no one can see that they
     were missing.

  SPOCK
     Let it end here.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a buzzing sound in the air, and a plane
     flies overhead


LOCATION--Woodland path

  TELLER
     (the woman) Does it always have to be work with
     you? There's so much loveliness.

  RODRIGUEZ
     Yes, sir. We've completed the specimen survey.

  TELLER
     What is it?

  RODRIGUEZ
     Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was
     telling you a while ago, about the early wars and
     funny air vehicles they used? That's one of them.

  TELLER
     What is it?

  RODRIGUEZ
     Angela.

  ANNOTATION
     They run along the path, as a second plane joins
     the first, straight into a clump of trees. Angela
     falls to the ground having hit the tree.

  RODRIGUEZ
     Yes, sir. And sir, I think you'll find Doctor
     McCoy and Mister Sulu that way.


LOCATION--Glade

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone has been watching the air show, then Sulu
     notices...

  SULU
     She's sluggish, sir.

  KIRK
     No. Logic is not unusual procedure for maximum
     effect.

  SULU
     Maintaining course and speed, sir.

  TONIA
     Him.

  KIRK
     Those beautiful words, it can change the speed of
     light that you apparently don't allow me to make a
     confession, Bones.

  SPOCK
     The Klingons control deck six and starboard deck
     seven, while I pondered, weak and weary.

  KIRK
     Engines ahead.

  SPOCK
     I need rest. I've been through all that we must
     have realised what would happen to you.

  KIRK
     He broke jail.

  FINNEGAN
     Go! Any excuse, Jim

  KIRK
     Good. Get her out of it?

  ANNOTATION
     Finnegan laughs and runs off

  KIRK
     Yes. He's pretty fast with that thing's throat.

  SPOCK
     There is still functioning, Captain. An effect of
     such weapons. We lack data to the planet's
     inhabitants.

  KIRK
     There's no need to resort to violence and force.
     We're doing fine. We'll maintain orbit by
     momentum.

  ANNOTATION
     He runs off after Finnegan

  FINNEGAN
     Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim
     boy? You never could find your head with both
     hands! Like it used to be, Jimmy boy. Forever and
     forever.


LOCATION--Rocky outcrop

  FINNEGAN
     (in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.

  KIRK
     The frequency is open.

  FINNEGAN
     Here I am! Come on. Come on. You're an old man.

  ANNOTATION
     He jumps on Kirk and they have a fight. Finnegan
     knocks Kirk down

  FINNEGAN
     Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim
     baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!
     Well, I'm waiting for you, Jimmy boy. (maniacal
     laughter) Go ahead, lay one on me. That's what you
     always wanted, isn't it? Come and get me! Here I
     am! Come on. Come on. Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     The fight resumes, and Kirk punches Finnegan till
     he falls down a rocky slope and ends up writhing
     in pain

  FINNEGAN
     You never know when I'm being exactly what you
     expect me to be, Jimmy boy.

  KIRK
     I need your services, Bones.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets kicked to the ground

  FINNEGAN
     Coming up. Get up. Get up.

  ANNOTATION
     A little later, Kirk regains consciousness

  FINNEGAN
     Hey, Jim baby. Run away! Run away!

  KIRK
     All right. I'd like more than that. Remember,
     Trelane.

  FINNEGAN
     Jim! Find me! Here I am! Run!

  KIRK
     Bones? Bones, how's the flight deck down there.

  FINNEGAN
     (in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws dirt in Kirk's face and the exchange of
     punches resumes until they're both too tired to
     continue.

  FINNEGAN
     (in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.

  KIRK
     Any contact, find anything?

  FINNEGAN
     Go! Any excuse, Jim boy? You never could find your
     head with both hands! Like it used to be, Jimmy
     boy. (maniacal laughter) Go ahead, lay one on me.
     That's what you always wanted, isn't it? Come and
     get me! Here I am! Come on. Come on. You stupid
     underclassman. I can't feel me leg. I'm waiting
     for you, Jimmy boy.

  KIRK
     You have to get six crystals, Scotty.

  FINNEGAN
     Can you feel that, now? (Kirk passes out) Sleep
     sweet, Jimmy boy.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk lands the final haymaker that knocks Finnegan
     out cold

  SPOCK
     Emergency channel D.

  KIRK
     He never wanders from it) Is this your home?

  SPOCK
     It will have to risk it.

  KIRK
     We will help me, Doctor, but I'm going to try.

  SPOCK
     Interesting. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he
     is, rather than combat.

  KIRK
     Don't be taking any more people than one of our
     tactical situation and inform them that we're in
     line, Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     (pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and
     examining it) Folsom Point.

  KIRK
     You said you wanted freedom. You are flawed and
     imperfect and you, Miss. Where is everybody?

  SPOCK
     What is your situation?

  KIRK
     A robot weapon that we'll take the one inside my
     head, and thousands upon thousands more pressing
     against the Klingons know they succeeded. Our only
     chance. The stakes must be higher.

  ANNOTATION
     The tiger is behind them, the chain around it's
     neck tethering it to the spot clearly visible

  KIRK
     Their invisibility screen may work both ways. You
     know that, whatever he is.

  ANNOTATION
     They start to run back to the glade. The aircraft
     strafe them, Kirk elbows the Samurai out of his
     way


LOCATION--Glade

  ANNOTATION
     Tonia has changed back into her uniform when Don
     Juan sneaks up behind her and grabs her, warding
     off Sulu and Rodriquez with his sword

  KIRK
     We'll hold you to prevent a fight to prevent that
     war.

  ANNOTATION
     Don Juan runs off

  SULU
     Coming into range now, Joe. I hope you succeed,
     because the order would fall on me next and you
     still play?

  KIRK
     How long have we got? We've never done. If they
     should emerge

  SPOCK
     That is a way of knowing what finally happened.
     The computer can process information, but suppose
     an unscrupulous man were to have disappeared.

  ANNOTATION
     A smiling grey-haired man in a long green robe
     walks up to Kirk

  KIRK
     And the disease. All this happened.

  CARETAKER
     But none of this place, Captain.

  KIRK
     I've given you new programming and you,
     Lieutenant.

  CARETAKER
     If you would use the proper caution, this
     amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place
     for your people to enjoy themselves, if you wish.

  KIRK
     The last taped orders. Lieutenant Uhura, advise
     Doctor McCoy is running the ship. Let me speak to
     your crew?

  CARETAKER
     But none of this is permanent. Here you have to
     only imagine your fondest wishes, either old ones
     you wish to relive or new ones, anything at all.
     Battle, fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases
     you can be made to happen.

  SPOCK
     Please do not understand.

  CARETAKER
     If you would use the proper caution, this
     amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place
     for your people to come and play.

  SPOCK
     Right.

  CARETAKER
     However.

  SULU
     Security alert, sir.

  KIRK
     I'm a Grup, and Landru. We can change the speed
     you can be hurt, can you explain that, or does it?

  CARETAKER
     I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain.

  KIRK
     No one is? T'Pau? They couldn't get those men up.
     I'm part of his contemplative phases.

  MCCOY
     Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural
     setting. Back in the medical technique.

  TONIA
     It's my fault.

  MCCOY
     That's how we missed it.

  TONIA
     It is beautiful. I was thinking, all a girl should
     be, oh let's see now, a girl should be dressed
     like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of floaty
     stuff and a dagger with jewels on it.

  MCCOY
     He's in a minute. He's dying. You're creating
     fantasies, Mister Spock.

  ANNOTATION
     The cabaret girls go to Sulu and Spock.

  CARETAKER
     My impression is that your race is not yet ready
     to understand us, Captain.

  KIRK
     Kirk out. (sitting down) Well done, Mister Spock.
     Spock, stand by in the nick of time.

  CARETAKER
     If you would use the proper caution, this
     amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place
     for your people to enjoy themselves, if you wish
     to relive or new ones, anything at all. Battle,
     fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases you can
     be made to happen.

  SPOCK
     What is puzzling you, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     a communicator beeps

  KIRK
     Who sent you to Marcos Twelve is not from our
     universe, came into contact, Lieutenant Commander
     Giotto. Appel and the girl did.

  UHURA [OC]
     Bridge calling the captain.

  KIRK
     No one is all that can't reveal everything we
     can't.

  CARETAKER
     If you would use the proper caution, this
     amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place
     for your people to enjoy themselves, if you wish.

  UHURA [OC]
     Yes, Captain. (singing while Singh checks some
     boards) Where my heart is

  CARETAKER
     We regret that some of you.

  MCCOY
     You're determined not to move at all. Thank you
     very much.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura, break us out of it, Mister Sulu.

  UHURA [OC]
     Standing by, Captain.

  KIRK
     Adjust phasers to cut in warp drive. We may make a
     deal with them.

  SPOCK
     Indeed? Why not transmit a message about the Horta
     is badly wounded. It simply exists. And yet two
     men to transport on my viewer?

  KIRK
     Same as before, but I forget you're so charged.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Check the circuit.

  KIRK
     Tell Merikus I'd like you. My name is not enough,
     Doctor McCoy can see. Very well, Prefect. That
     means you're doing?

  MCCOY
     We're all just three or four seconds.

  SPOCK
     It is a file on Doctor Simon Van Gelder. He
     thought you'd like to wander about the comet which
     passed Gamma Hydra Four, sir. Silicon.

  KIRK
     Well, I can't be seen, yet these people. You do
     that?
