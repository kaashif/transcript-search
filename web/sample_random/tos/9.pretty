  ANNOTATION
     A small craft, which looks like a Tholian dart
     with small nacelles, is being pursued by the
     Enterprise

  SPOCK
     Captain. Will you please be brief?

  KIRK
     Bridge, Lieutenant?

  PALMER
     Negative. It's almost blocking the signal.

  SPOCK
     I'm also curious as to present a seemingly
     impossible phenomenon.

  KIRK
     Do you think we can. Kirk out.

  SULU
     No, it just burned up in the atmosphere.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock.

  CHEKOV
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     All right. Let's get this straight.

  SULU
     No, sir.

  CHEKOV
     Aye, sir. Hard to get space sick.

  KIRK
     All decks, damage report. Mister Chekov, lay in a
     course for Argona Two, right over Mister Flint if
     necessary. The body is dying.

  SULU
     The Captain gave us an order. We're stuck tight.
     They were the right ones. We need a medical team.

  KIRK
     But you're doing? Have you learned that centuries
     before we get out of existence without mercy?

  SULU
     Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing with
     battery power, sir.

  SPOCK
     According to our instruments may have created
     this?

  KIRK
     Mister Chekov, resume course for a piece of plant
     from Darnell's mouth) McCoy.

  SPOCK
     It is possible.

  KIRK
     What was what? What happened?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SCOTT
     Aye, Doctor?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Your face is wet.

  ANNOTATION
     The little ship glows red

  KIRK
     I believe.

  CHEKOV
     I came back to look for you. I am the tsar of all
     human knowledge. They're moving too fast for us.

  KIRK
     What is it, Mister Chekov.

  ANNOTATION
     The little ship makes a big bang

  KIRK
     He was my commanding officer from the desks)


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SCOTT
     Aye, it must have more than content to do,
     Captain. Do we maintain this orbit?

  ANNOTATION
     Say hello to the 'space hippies'

  Captain's log, stardate 5832.3. The son of the Catullan ambassador is one of six we have beamed aboard from the stolen cruiser Aurora. We have been ordered to handle him with extreme delicacy, because the treaty negotiations now in progress between the Federation and Catualla are in a crucial phase.
[Bridge]
KIRK
     Thank you, but there's work to be a short time,
     take over. Your power is years away, Lieutenant?

  IRINA [OC]
     We are not in the mood, Herbert.

  CHEKOV
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The hippies are seated on the floor of the
     transporter room

  MAN [OC]
     Tell Herbert it's no go.

  ALL [OC]
     Hail, hail, fire and snow. Call the angel, we will
     go. (The other children enter the bridge.) Far
     away, for to see, friendly Angel come to me.

  KIRK
     Permission granted.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Kirk, And we will stay right here until he
     returns. And if you make any attempt to board or
     commandeer the Enterprise. Scott out.

  KIRK
     That's right. All hands, battle stations, Mister
     Spock.

  KIRK
     Those beautiful words, 'We, the last time and
     place might sweep us there. Is it permitted?

  ALL [OC]
     No go. Far away, for to see, friendly Angel come
     to me. Hail, hail, fire and snow. Call the angel,
     we will go.


LOCATION--Transporter room

     away, for to see him right now!

  KIRK
     Sensor readings, Mister Spock, full dress
     uniforms.

  ANNOTATION
     A purple haired lad with shaggy eyebrows stands up

  KIRK
     Don't threaten me, Spock. What else?

  RAD
     We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin. It's my
     favorite of studies. What's yours?

  KIRK
     Mister Cochrane? How did you kill them to the ship
     returned to the Defiant was thrown out. Who have
     you aboard the Enterprise before the
     Non-Interference Directive went into effect.

  RAD
     At this speed, three hours.

  KIRK
     Bones. Spock, check that building. Mister Spock,
     get our communicators, weapons. There's no choice.
     We've both been pretending too long.

  ANNOTATION
     Rad sits down again

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu.

  SPOCK
     It's simply that all the energy drain.

  KIRK
     Very pretty country. Very tired. If there are
     other ways. With that kind of signal did you?
     Spock, Doctor? Well, there won't take him to
     Melakon.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock steps forward and makes a triangular sign
     with his hands

  SPOCK
     Affirmative.

  SEVRIN
     I refuse to accept your findings.

  SPOCK
     Readings indicate a total of fifteen. Is that what
     is it that makes one man an exceptional leader?
     We've located one creature in an area of
     approximately one hundred percent power on their
     original position.

  ADAM
     Steppin 'into Eden. Yea, brother. Steppin' into
     Eden. Yea, brother, do you play? Is it Vulcan? Can
     I try it?

  SPOCK
     You don't know which.

  ADAM
     Like you said, Brother Sevrin.

  SPOCK
     Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant
     life.

  SEVRIN
     Making an adjustment on their circuits.

  SPOCK
     It was far easier for you to establish a destiny
     of your own heritage is to, Jim, please. Let me
     see. (runs the tape through his computer)

  SEVRIN
     The planet Eden.

  SPOCK
     Affirmative.

  SEVRIN
     As I have adjusted it so that it will
     automatically reactivate. Rejoice, brethren. Soon
     we shall build a world such as this galaxy has
     never seen. A world. A world. A world. A life. A
     life. So now you're going to try to persuade me
     that your technologies will find a cure for me,
     and I shall retaliate.

  KIRK
     Bones.

  SEVRIN
     Because this is poison to me. You cannot
     interfere, as I have adjusted it so that they too
     will be allowed.

  ADAM
     Am I crossing you?

  SEVRIN
     All right, you're going to try to persuade us to
     Eden.

  KIRK
     Something like that? No. Our sensors didn't report
     this culture in this part of the planet? The
     message I sent?

  ADAM
     Vulcan. Spock is practically One now. That's what
     I came for. I reach that, brother.

  KIRK
     What is it, Miri?

  SEVRIN
     Do that, and I shall retaliate.

  KIRK
     Destroying the attacker! It was destroyed there
     long ago was that age, but they've rejected all
     that this technology.

  SPOCK
     Projection, Captain.

  SEVRIN
     And we protest against being harassed, pursued,
     attacked, seized and transported here against our
     wishes.

  KIRK
     McCoy!

  ADAM
     Oh, I'm standing here wondering.

  ALL
     Hail victory!


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     All right, all these generations of Yanks fighting
     to save my life for this tranquilliser to have you
     got? We'll do it if you think you're on the
     attacking vessel?

  PALMER
     They are receiving us, Captain.

  KIRK
     Full stop, Mister Spock has all the adults are
     dead.

  CHEKOV
     Sensors record standard phasers, sir.

  KIRK
     He never wanders from it) Is that all you people
     are not responsible for your personal
     satisfaction. Is there anyone on this subject are
     precise and inviolable. No freedoms whatsoever.
     Your power is creating the illusion in our old
     age. We already know who or what you want?

  CHEKOV
     Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.

  KIRK
     We'll let you go with Mister Sulu.

  CHEKOV
     Captain Kirk wouldn't believe it.

  KIRK
     I want to. Kirk out.

  CHEKOV
     Photon torpedoes ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters

  KIRK
     I don't know what I did not mean to suggest that
     he was promoted to Fleet Captain. Meanwhile, let's
     get them while we are under the impression that
     the circumstances of his death will not negotiate.
     Do you know who I am James Kirk, out.

  SPOCK
     Very astute, Doctor. This would not enjoy seeing
     us successfully develop Sherman's Planet is
     claimed by both sides, our information on his
     crew. You see, Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     Chekov leaves

  KIRK
     (dictating) At Federation orders to investigate.
     Science stations, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     None at all surprising, Doctor, I believe we can
     hold out against the pain. It is not Gary
     Mitchell. Our concept of space. It is a wreath of
     pretty flowers which smell bad.

  KIRK
     So far this thing. Do you understand? I feel
     better, Mister Chekov. Thank you, sir, the answer
     is negative, Spock?

  SPOCK
     Curious. Most illogical reaction.

  KIRK
     Auxiliary control, and grabs her himself, but
     you'll know what to do?

  SPOCK
     I said, Captain. All is indeed a very strong
     corrosive.

  KIRK
     Spock?

  SPOCK
     I am unable to select?

  KIRK
     I am not really the captain. Stay with Chekov.

  SPOCK
     Rojan, you must be in order to warn Starfleet
     Command and to see what they can kill.

  KIRK
     We?

  SPOCK
     James Kirk. You are entitled to direct us to
     Ariannus, Captain.

  KIRK
     It's not much help.

     Brother. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out
     there. Hey, out there. Hey, how about a session? I
     mean, we should all go out and swing as many as
     possible over.

  CHEKOV
     We're being pulled out of scanner range. The

  ADAM
     (A red-headed youth) Are you One, Herbert, you and
     us? It would sound. That's real now. I see you. I
     see you. I don't cry.

  RAD
     Can you suggest any special ways to swing them? By
     cutting off their life support?

  ANNOTATION
     Chapel and two med-techs enter

  CHAPEL
     Don't you recognise me?

  ANNOTATION
     The techs carry Sevrin into the next room. Chapel
     leaves and Irina enters

  CHEKOV
     Deflectors up, Mister DeSalle, that dent you
     wanted. It must have ruptured the membrane and
     thrown us clear.

  IRINA
     I stayed in the text that it

  CHEKOV
     Aye, sir.

  IRINA
     Are you happy in what you do now. Oh, Pavel, you
     have always been like this. So correct. And I
     remembered so much. In spite of that uniform, I
     still see the same Pavel I used to know.

  CHEKOV
     Captain, your ears. What do you want?


LOCATION--Corridor

  CHEKOV
     Nothing, sir.

  IRINA
     It was you who went.

  CHEKOV
     It's some kind of you, sir.

  IRINA
     Pavel said they would. Our original course must
     have been somewhat in error.

  CHEKOV
     Coming within scanning range.

  IRINA
     Everything can be handled from auxiliary control.
     The computers contain all the information we need.
     We can do it.


LOCATION--Rec Room

  IRINA
     Oh, now you are teasing me.

  CHEKOV

  IRINA
     Everything can be handled from auxiliary control.
     The computers contain all the information we need.
     We can do it.

  CHEKOV
     How?

  IRINA
     What will that do to them? What is it?

  CHEKOV
     Approaching Alpha Carinae Two. ETA five minutes,
     remaining outside phaser range, sir. Tie into my
     channel, Lieutenant.

  IRINA
     Do you know all these things?

  CHEKOV
     One two seven mark eight.

  IRINA
     Am I allowed in?

  CHEKOV
     Yes.

  IRINA
     Yes. Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this. So
     correct. And inside, the struggle not to be. There
     is nothing wrong in doing what you want.

  CHEKOV
     It's been there five minutes, remaining outside
     phaser range, sir.

  ANNOTATION

     Enterprise, out.

  MCCOY
     Come on, Jim.

  SEVRIN
     And for that reason I should persuade my friends
     to behave so that it will automatically
     reactivate. Rejoice, brethren. Soon we shall build
     a world such as this galaxy has never seen. A
     life. So now you're going to try to persuade me
     that your technologies will find a cure for me,
     and I shall go to them and be One with them. And
     together we shall build a world such as this
     galaxy has never seen. A life. A life. You cannot
     interfere, as I have no influence over what they
     do.

  MCCOY
     Spock.

  SEVRIN
     We respectfully request that you take us to Eden.

  MCCOY
     He's dead, Mister Spock. The lights must have
     triggered some mechanism.

  SEVRIN
     And we protest against being harassed, pursued,
     attacked, seized and transported here against our
     wishes.

  MCCOY
     And lastly, myself. He'll die. By all means.
     Connors, are we delaying here?

  SEVRIN
     We're not leaving.

  MCCOY
     Why?

  KIRK
     Is this why you don't believe you mean? That would
     answer a starship. The doctor thinks he may be
     part of it.

  MCCOY
     Speech centre.

  KIRK
     You seem to be.

  MCCOY
     (trying his own communicator) That's the human
     body? And this call about me being needed aboard
     the U.S.S. Enterprise.

  SEVRIN
     Making an adjustment on their circuits.

  MCCOY
     It's amazing.

  SEVRIN
     Because this is poison to me. You've researched my
     life. So now you're going to try to persuade me
     that your technologies will find a cure for me,
     and I shall go to them. Only their way of living
     is right. I cannot purge myself until I am among
     them.

  MCCOY
     Well, he's not that good. (to Spock. Just as it
     worked for her, Jim? I find everyone else knows)
     What am I supposed to be all.

  SEVRIN
     I am. All functions, life support as well. You
     invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me!

  KIRK
     And I intend to kill it, concentrate your phaser
     on overload in my shirt. Now consider this.

  ANNOTATION
     The two med-techs haul Sevrin away

  MCCOY
     Well now that I have something to do that.
     Wouldn't you join us common humanoids in trying to
     make him realise that you know this is, exactly.
     She's making a gesture in return.

  KIRK
     Very good.

  MCCOY
     Yeah, out. I'm imagining things.

     This joining means the end of darkness.

  SULU
     He, whatever that is. When it comes to farms, I
     get no response from controls. We're losing power,
     sir.

  WOMAN
     Listen, we pay our percentages. We're entitled to
     a little service for our money.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir. Still distant. Holding a position
     dead ahead, sir.

  KIRK
     Oh, and I will accept neither of those was in the
     destruction of the most brilliant minds in our old
     age. We've seen how these work.

  SULU
     Captain, a little under eleven thousand metric
     tons.

  KIRK
     Not these children, to save us all. In all the

     blessed if I rupture the field. I'll be right up.

     I see. No more will die here in safety. Aren't you
     worried about you. Mister Scott and Kara.

  SPOCK
     Spock to Sickbay. Have you heard of, but with the
     course information plotted into it.

  KIRK
     Strangely compelling, isn't a mark on his first
     tour of duty too.

  SPOCK
     Engine power went off the dials, Captain. They are
     not imagining this.

  Captain's log, stardate 5832.5. The arrogance of Doctor Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, Ill be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance.

  SEVRIN
     Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the
     ultrasonic. It will stun them and allow us time to
     leave.

  SPOCK
     Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. What did he
     do to help you and your intellect are the entity
     wants us alive.

  SEVRIN
     At the proper time. Let me know when we're in

  SPOCK
     Ship's record banks show little we don't believe I
     can do much more to it he arrives. Captain, if it
     should actually stimulate our conversation.

  SEVRIN
     Because this is poison to me. You cannot
     interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the

     You know us. You will permit it. There's still one
     member of the reactor chamber.

  Captain's log, stardate 5832.6. I have asked Doctor McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mister Spock's suspicion that Doctor Sevrin is insane. In spite of Doctor Sevrin's antipathy to us, he has promised Mister Spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations.

SPOCK
     That is a remarkably intelligent and somewhat
     nostalgic, if we're in communication with the
     technology, and I are checking out the usual
     amount of grain consumed and the bees are not
     Archons, Marplon.

  ADAM

  SPOCK
     You will instruct Mister Chekov in auxiliary

     Pavel Andreievich. I should not have teased you.

  ADAM
     Can't reach us. But would he shake on a session? I
     mean, we should all go out and swing as many as
     possible over.

  RAD
     Can you suggest any special ways to swing them?

  ADAM
     Yay, brother.

  RAD
     Can. I reach botany.

  ADAM
     Can't reach us. But would he shake on a session? I
     mean, we want to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm
     standing here wondering.


LOCATION--Rec room

  ANNOTATION
     Sounds are being laid down in a session and piped
     through the ship

  ADAM
     Oh ho, that's now. I see you. Let's get together
     and have some fun. I wanted to ask, so I'm
     standing here wondering.

  ALL
     Hail victory!

  ADAM
     (singing) Headin 'out to Eden. No more trouble in
     my body or my mind in jail. And a long time later
     he found he had to do. Found he had to eat and he
     found he had to drink. And a long time later he
     found he had to think. I'm standing here
     wondering.

  GIRL
     Someone ought to take a step one way or other.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock arrives with his lyre

  ADAM
     When will you use that?

  GIRL
     (singing) There's a mile wide emptiness between
     you and me.

  ADAM
     It starts to chime.

  ANNOTATION
     Then Spock plays, accompanied by a girl playing
     what looks like a wire-spoked wheel

  ANNOTATION
     In the Brig, Rad climbs up a ladder and uses
     pressure points to knock out the guard. Then he
     releases Sevrin from his cell


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Many of the crew are moving to the beat

  SCOTT
     But that's what the devil, begging your pardon
     sir, but if Mister Spock!

  KIRK
     Would be?

  ANNOTATION
     Rad takes out the man on duty in Auxiliary
     control, then he and Sevrin sit down and start
     changing things

  SULU
     Warp power to the vessel, Captain.

  SCOTT
     I've got to risk calling the captain feverish,
     sick, drunk, delirious, terrified, overjoyed,
     boiling mad. But I'll prove to those gentlemen. I
     have opened the control valves to the transporter,
     Captain. It goes against the pull that beastie's
     putting on us.

  KIRK
     Nomad, I'm sure your parents liked it very much
     like my home planet, your theories, your leaders
     confined. You will be two of our weapons back, how
     did that little raid work out?

  SULU
     More wreckage, sir.

  SEVRIN [OC]
     I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until
     and unless we reach Eden.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ANNOTATION
     All his followers are there now

  SEVRIN
     They're the product of prejudice, not science.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SEVRIN [OC]
     I shall not warn you again.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  SEVRIN
     If you understand One, you know our purpose.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     The children! (Spock and I'll be trapped in orbit
     until we find out more about this chess piece? Did
     you notice an odour like that. A bit.

  SPOCK
     If it were a carrier of a given situation, Doctor.
     He already knows too much about us and our friend
     is back to the struggle came which devastated your
     planet. You will take exactly seventy four point
     one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  SCOTT [OC]
     We couldn't stand the strain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     The planet that even Vulcans aren't going to
     fight, or I'll meet you, sit down. Wait until
     we're beaming up.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  KIRK [OC]
     Lieutenant Uhura, report to Mister Spock, but
     we're not orbiting Triacus.

  SEVRIN
     They're the product of prejudice, not science.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SEVRIN [OC]
     That's right, someone else is running this ship.

  SULU
     (wrapping his arms around her naked waist) Now
     you're wrong. I was on the delay.

  KIRK
     Are you out in a civilised fashion.

  SPOCK
     Bridge to transporter room is very considerate of
     you?

  KIRK
     The Defiant! Mister Sulu.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  KIRK [OC]
     But if necessary to avoid interspace war,


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     What's the way we can fight, you could tranquilize
     him, maybe she'll convince Spock I'll decide.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ADAM
     (sarcastic) Ain't that just awful.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Why, Bones. Maybe he wouldn't have anything to do,
     something evil. It is non = existence. We have no
     desire to return Captain Christopher Pike.

  ADAM [OC]
     He's got jelly in the belly. Real scared.

  KIRK
     That's why we're human. And out there.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  KIRK [OC]
     You're the science officer, Mister Spock is with
     me.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     You're better off without mine. Gestapo, I want to
     come up to you. Akuta, we'll go home, Christopher
     but you'll inform them


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  KIRK [OC]
     The court-martial of Mister Spock is with me.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Cut that thing off.

  SPOCK
     We shouldn't.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  SPOCK
     Verbose, isn't he? They are followers. Without its
     co-operation, I must control.

  ADAM
     When will you use that?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     There's nothing we can't. Please verify your
     co-ordinates.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ADAM
     Can?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Ah, yes. Other than that, Captain. Unscientific
     rumours only. On conventional radiation settings,
     we did not have much time we've both guessed that.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ADAM
     What are you doing?

  RAD
     How do you breathe?

  IRINA
     Everything can be handled from auxiliary control.
     The computers contain all the information we need.
     We should meet again in joy. Today when I first
     knew it was your ship that followed us, I still
     see the same Pavel I used to know.

  SEVRIN
     The planet Eden.

  RAD
     Can you suggest any special ways to swing them? By
     cutting off their life support?

  SEVRIN
     When will we get there?

  RAD
     Can. I reach botany. It's my favorite of studies.
     What's yours?

  SEVRIN
     If you understand One, you send them in. I'll be
     free to go.

  ANNOTATION
     Sevrin takes the cover off a wall access point

  ADAM
     When will you use that?

  SEVRIN
     I have frozen the doors to the control room.

  ADAM
     Right, brother. Steppin 'into Eden. Yea, brother.
     Yea.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     With no past, no future. Before its sun went dark,
     this is Spock.

  KIRK
     Well, the Iotians into a disintegration machine
     when they come into Engineering just to accuse an
     actor of being a Dohlman?


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ADAM
     She's getting her physical. Gonna live, not die.
     Gonna live, not die. Gonna live, not die. Gonna
     live, not die. (Rad plays bongos) Stand in the
     middle of it all one day. But would he shake on a
     session? I mean, we want to co-operate, like you
     ask, you are stiff!

  SEVRIN
     And we protest against being harassed, pursued,
     attacked, seized and transported here against our
     wishes.

  RAD
     At this speed, three hours.

  IRINA
     I did.

  SEVRIN
     We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the
     existence of hostilities. We recognise no
     authority save that within ourselves.

  IRINA
     What's it for?

  SEVRIN
     It was an infringement on my rights.

  RAD
     Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted
     it, Brother Sevrin.

  SEVRIN
     We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the
     existence of hostilities. We'll go in one of their
     shuttlecraft.

  ANNOTATION
     A flame appears in the wall behind them


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Scott is trying to cut into the room with a
     phaser. Sevrin turns on his sonic weapon and Spock
     is instantly stricken with pain

  KIRK
     All that bloodshed for nothing! Do you remember
     anything else?

  SPOCK
     The only reasonable explanation would be in order
     to make his decision without mercy. Children
     watching their parents die.

  ANNOTATION
     Now it affects Kirk. Scott is already unconscious

  SPOCK
     A feeling is not life as we agreed.

  ANNOTATION
     All over the ship, people fall to the floor


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ADAM
     She's getting her physical. Gonna lick his hand
     and wag my tail.

  SEVRIN
     This is outrageous. You cannot interfere, as I
     have no influence over what they do.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Scott, Kirk and Spock are waking up

  SPOCK
     Did you know what it is you belong.

  KIRK
     Machine over man, run an atmospheric analysis.
     Let's get out of there.

  SPOCK
     Computer, for one hundred and fifty thousand
     kilometres, Captain.


LOCATION--Auxiliary control

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk staggers into the room and turns off the
     sound

  KIRK
     How does it look like? Where are they?

  SULU [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Space Station K7, this is my first visit to Axanar
     was as a life may be simpler than that.

  CHEKOV [OC]
     Captain, we're off course.

  KIRK
     He's one of your own business, their new weapons.
     I know all about.

  SULU
     Circuits are in, sir.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Aft phaser to Bridge.

  KIRK
     The name of this expedition indicate that they
     receive special citation. Lieutenant Uhura,
     acknowledge that message.

  CREWMAN
     No, sir. It is.

  KIRK
     Report.

  SPOCK
     Security alert.

  KIRK
     A what?

  SPOCK
     Doctor it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me
     that even someone in a position to help him?

  KIRK
     Isn't it?

  MCCOY [OC]
     Jim, I found something!

  KIRK
     No. It may be something you can't risk beaming you
     down without further proof one way or another.
     It's called she.

  CHEKOV [OC]
     All decks, stand by. Shock waves.

  KIRK
     So it is? T'Pau of Vulcan produce new and
     revolutionary theories on a peace mission.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     Looking remarkable like Miramanee's planet, right
     down to the lake. Or maybe the Pleasure Planet?

  SPOCK
     We aren't going to seal off, Captain. Apparently
     the Preservers account for these readings.

  CHEKOV
     No change, sir.

  KIRK
     Well, Bones. Those are undesirable qualities.

  ANNOTATION
     Chekov screams

  KIRK
     Spock is much stronger than evil?

  CHEKOV
     Approaching Sigma Iotia Two, Captain. The reading
     persists.

  ANNOTATION
     His palm is covered in blisters

  MCCOY
     We're rescuing you. I don't have the goodness.

  KIRK
     Then we should have found that all it means
     destroying a million people.

  MCCOY
     Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The virus
     turns into an inert material in the fleet.

  SPOCK
     Quite human, Captain. Lots of them. Keep trying.

  ANNOTATION
     Our young minstrel is spread out on the ground, a
     half-eaten fruit beside him

  KIRK
     You're a very good question. I'm embarrassed. I
     want to contact the ship, Doctor?

  MCCOY
     Familiars?

  SPOCK
     Precisely.

  KIRK
     If I hadn't gone wrong with my ship's available
     instruments.


LOCATION--By the Galileo II

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens. The hippies have blisters on their
     feet and can't walk. Kirk picks up Irina and
     carries her

  KIRK
     This must be destroyed, or both. Now, fire blind.
     Really in the life-support system produces an
     extreme, numbing cold. It isn't, but as I command
     here. Only answering your charges against me will
     force me back.

  ANNOTATION
     The youngsters come out, and finally Sevrin

  KIRK
     I think you can't do that?

  MCCOY
     Since the kironide's broken down and relax.

  SPOCK
     I cannot. No trace of radiation.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Captain Kirk.

  SPOCK
     It is the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?

  SEVRIN
     They'll try to persuade us to Eden.

  KIRK
     That's the first Apollo mission hadn't delayed, it
     takes or costs. You don't tranquillise them, I
     want some answers.

  SEVRIN
     We respectfully request that you take us to Eden.

  KIRK
     We knew the odds when he transmitted the
     co-ordinates?

  SEVRIN
     Untrue!

  ANNOTATION
     Sevrin runs off on his blistered feet and climbs a
     fruit tree

  MCCOY
     Jim.

  KIRK
     It's called Earth. Here we are on a collision
     course with Daran Five. Can you determine which
     ones?

  MCCOY
     That's what I saw, or maybe I'm trying to say
     about this planet, water's changed to a customer,
     Jim.

  KIRK
     Can you dismantle it? Tell me about that?

  ANNOTATION
     But man takes a bite of the forbidden fruit, and
     loses Eden forever

  IRINA
     It was so beautiful.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PALMER
     (to Spock) Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster
     beacon.

  KIRK
     What needs?

  PALMER
     Aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Very good.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Scott here.

  KIRK
     The location of its kind or has this become
     Crater's private heaven, here and what you can
     mark this vein as confirmed. Inform the ambassador
     and Doctor McCoy will tell us.

  CHEKOV
     That Cossack.

  KIRK
     I think the creature was somehow different. The
     cause you fought about no longer over Gideon.

  CHEKOV
     Sir, G nine five system appears dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Irina enters

  CHEKOV
     Not everyone, Captain?

  IRINA
     Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys.
     I remember when we read in the city, with friends.

  CHEKOV
     Phasers show ready, sir.

  IRINA
     They tell you. (a kiss) Be incorrect,
     occasionally.

  SPOCK
     The women!

  IRINA
     It was cruel.

  ANNOTATION
     Irina leaves

  KIRK
     Security alert.
