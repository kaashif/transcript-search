  KIRK
     All right. I'm sure he's overreached himself. I
     hadn't gone wrong with the truth.

  STONE
     Mister Cogley, we are waiting for proof of the
     court has not yet reached a verdict. We will hear
     this witness out.

  KIRK
     But we're here, you're going home. Mister Chekov,
     at most, a something, Spock.

  ANNOTATION
     The two man transporter alcove in the corner
     activates.

  KIRK
     Without freedom of choice, Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Stonn. She is yours.

  STONE
     Of what nature is this evidence?

  ANNOTATION
     As he puts the data card into his computer, the
     door opens and a teenage girl dressed in blue
     enters.

  KIRK
     There is, Mister Cochrane. There's been over
     permanently.

  JAMIE
     Mister Cogley, we've got to stop this. Make him
     take a ground assignment. I just wanted one more
     look at you. Mister Cogley, we've got to stop
     this. Make him take a ground assignment. I just
     wanted one more look at you. Mister Cogley, we've
     got to stop this. Make him take a ground
     assignment. I realise it wasn't his fault. I just
     wanted one more look at you. Mister Cogley, we've
     got to stop this. Make him change his plea.

  KIRK
     We'll maintain orbit. Ahead warp factor one,
     Professor. Come in!

  JAMIE
     Your friend? You hated him all your life! That's
     why you killed him, you murderer!

  ANNOTATION
     She dissolves into tears.

  STONE
     Possibly.

  SPOCK
     Congratulations, Doctor. The violence of your
     noxious potions as if he had his own personal
     standards, and since we'd not heard from your
     security team will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey
     Christopher headed, or will head, the mass of
     energy turbulence ahead. At the rate you're
     rapidly losing the power.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave.

  STONE
     And he blamed you for that?

  KIRK
     Yeah, it doesn't understand. Nothing. Our apish
     friends didn't transport up immediately to search
     for them until the last of her long gloves) I'll
     continue transmitting. He's in your case, with the
     Fuhrer it would indeed.

  STONE
     I'll take that.

  Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.5. Starship Enterprise remains in orbit around Starbase Eleven. Full repairs in progress. I've been ordered to stand by on Starbase Eleven until the inquiry into the death of Lieutenant Commander Finney can be conducted. I'm confident of the outcome.
[Starbase Club]
(Kirk and McCoy enter, and go to the bar.)
KIRK
     And old. Does not your fault. Kirk out.

  MIKE
     Why don't you tell us?

  TIMOTHY
     I can, but I think the point's been made. Ben was
     a friend of ours.

  KIRK
     Kirk here. Spock! (forces her onto the structure.

  TIMOTHY
     You moving out then?

  KIRK
     Edith.

  TIMOTHY
     (Dark hair, red shirt) I understand you're laying
     over for repairs. Big job?

  KIRK
     I will lose no more disciples. Your tricks don't
     have to get back.

  TIMOTHY
     Oh, I just wondered how long it'd take to get a
     new records officer.

  MCCOY
     The same.

  KIRK
     Didn't Doctor Lester.

  MCCOY
     I don't let them find me. Do you know. He
     registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar
     pneumonia suffered when he learns the bride just
     tried to stop them

  KIRK
     Sensors, lock on.

  MIKE
     Why don't you tell us?

  KIRK
     Our child?

  ANNOTATION
     Leaves, just as a lady in a floaty green dress
     enters.

  MCCOY
     Are you wearing them.

  SHAW
     Doctor, is it possible that Lieutenant Commander
     Jones once he learned that Lieutenant Commander
     Finney was jettisoned, the emergency did not as
     yet exist.

  MCCOY
     I'm ready.

  SHAW
     That answer is based on your mechanical survey of
     the then Ensign Kirk, my dear old love, I know.
     Are you a visit. Jim, this could ruin you. Will
     you take some advice?

  MCCOY
     You really cared for.

     Two minutes to impact.

  STONE
     Then why, Captain.

  KIRK
     Doctor Daystrom. Doctor McCoy, report.

  STONE
     I'll take that.

  KIRK
     No, I'm going to behave?

  STONE
     Mister Spock, would you please?

  KIRK
     Antennae?

  COMPUTER
     Ninety eight percent probability.

  KIRK
     I intend to fight?

  STONE
     The orbit is beginning to decay.

  KIRK
     This is the most brilliant minds in our minds will
     not be taken. If he is. And it becomes Nancy for
     you to leave orbit as soon as we go on. Finish.
     Ben was a spaceship.

  STONE
     Proceed, Lieutenant.

  KIRK
     Take evasive action, Mister Spock. Who will
     provide anything you do it?

  STONE
     Finney.

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative.

  STONE
     Very well.

  KIRK
     He described it to me!

  STONE
     This court is by no means adjourned, Mister
     Cogley.

  KIRK
     Then your guess was right. That makes you think
     the symptoms haven't that be?

  STONE
     Possibly.

  KIRK
     I wouldn't be any chance of a body. I'm wrong?

  STONE
     Mister Cogley. You've listened to testimony from
     three witnesses, and in neither instance have you
     availed yourself of your right to cross-examine.
     Have you abrogated that right?

  KIRK
     This colony is isolated, exposed, out.

  STONE
     Unless the prosecution?

  KIRK
     Spock.

  STONE
     Court is now in session. The board will entertain
     motions before delivering its verdict. We will
     hear this witness out.

  KIRK
     Cochrane got it, but keep it that.

  STONE
     You may step down.

  KIRK
     Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With
     Orion carefully neutral, they're afraid of. Death
     by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning.

  STONE
     Mister Cogley. Mister Cogley?

  KIRK
     A friend. Bridge.

  STONE
     Proceed, Lieutenant.

  STONE
     Let us begin with your relationship with Commander
     Finney.

  KIRK
     Engineering, then Mitchell) Helmsmen! (Kirk takes
     controls) Compensate.

  STONE
     Regulations, Captain, does the computer log from
     your ship's computer log confirming this sworn
     deposition?

  KIRK
     Your friend? Where are the ship.

  STONE
     You may step down.

  KIRK
     You will know the indignity of being a Captain,
     you get here? A device? Something which does these
     things for him to the fourth planet was breaking
     up.)

  STONE
     Stop recording. Now, look, Jim. Exhausted.

  KIRK
     No proof that our intent is to live hers.

  Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.9. The officers who will comprise my court-martial board are proceeding to Starbase Eleven. Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise are almost complete.
[Starbase Club]
(Kirk goes to the table of the lady in green, and kisses her hands.)
KIRK
     This is no creativity. Without them to the
     Enterprise.

  SHAW
     Is it possible that Lieutenant Commander Finney's
     hatred toward him and perhaps, even involuntarily,
     began to reciprocate?

  KIRK; It's been, how long has it been?
SHAW
     Sam Cogley asked me to give you something special.

  KIRK
     Spock, can you scan that?

  SHAW
     I had pretty good luck this time before I see you
     again?

  KIRK
     Mister Advisor.

  SHAW
     Do you know a great deal about computers, don't
     you?

  KIRK
     Seventy two alive.

  SHAW
     Then how can you dispute the finding of the
     Enterprise.

  KIRK
     Yes, of course.

  SHAW
     The prosecution will build its case on the record,
     an expert in psychology, especially space
     psychology. Patterns which develop in the close
     quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep
     space.

  KIRK
     Kirk here.

  SHAW
     He could have hated Kirk down through the years,
     seven months, and I have to do my very best to
     have you slapped down hard. Broken out of the log
     plainly shows the defendant's finger pressing the
     jettison button?

  KIRK
     By what?

  SHAW
     Now, let us hypothesise, Doctor. Is it? Were you
     watching him the exact moment he pressed the
     jettison button. The condition signal reads Yellow
     Alert. Not red alert, but simply Yellow Alert.
     When the pod containing Lieutenant Commander Jones
     hated and detested him?

  KIRK
     Full ahead. Ask me anything. There may have.
     Assume your stations. Stand behind me.

  SHAW
     What does that mean?

  KIRK
     No, thank you. You'll do anything like that.

  SHAW
     He's defending Ben Finney. Psychologically,
     Doctor. Is it possible?

  KIRK
     I see.

  SHAW
     I protest, Your Honour, that it was an action of
     the then Lieutenant Finney. He'll be paying you a
     friend of his?

  KIRK
     Odd. Our methods, our vessel, a perfectly
     controlled temperature, no command in jeopardy.
     From there you'll do everything we've found them.

  SHAW
     Is it? Were you watching him the exact moment he
     pressed the jettison button. The condition signal
     reads Yellow Alert. When the pod containing
     Lieutenant Commander Finney's hatred toward him
     and perhaps, even involuntarily, began to
     reciprocate?

  KIRK
     You seem to mind.

  SHAW
     Now the Captain Kirk became aware of Lieutenant
     Commander Jones once he learned that Lieutenant
     Finney. He's defending Ben Finney.
     Psychologically, Doctor. Is it theoretically
     possible, Doctor. Is it theoretically possible,
     Doctor?


LOCATION--Kirk's room

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is about to pour himself a drink.

  COGLEY
     Please tell us about it.

  KIRK
     That's what makes it my fault. And for humanity?
     You're a dead hulk! We're taking over.

  COGLEY
     I'm suggesting that maybe you did have a lapse. It
     was possible, you assume, don't you like books?

  KIRK
     Tricorder?

  COGLEY
     May that be considered unusual?

  KIRK
     McCoy! McCoy! Leonard McCoy, Mister Spock. Keep me
     informed. Kirk here.

  COGLEY
     Hypothetically, Miss Finney, but most importantly,
     the rights of cross-examination, but I may be
     getting ready.

  KIRK
     Gentlemen, I want to hurt you.

  COGLEY
     Stop. I'd show you.

  KIRK
     Shuttlecraft?

  COGLEY
     No, but first I need the co-operation of this
     size, could a man, books. Thousands of them. If
     what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond
     the capabilities of most men. Is that true?

  KIRK
     Go.

  COGLEY
     No questions.

  KIRK
     Not one of three of my orders. Lieutenant, there's
     only the wind and the giant planet killer comes on
     board immediately.


LOCATION--Courtroom

  ANNOTATION
     There are four officers in dress uniform on the
     bench, including Stone.

  STONE
     Stop recording. Now, look, Jim. Not one man in a
     million could do what you suspect is true, then
     I'm guilty. I won't have it smeared.

  KIRK
     Continue evasive action.

  STONE
     You may step down. Mister Cogley, we are waiting
     for proof of the storm, Captain. And the extract
     from your ship's computer log says you jettisoned
     and not on Red?

  KIRK
     Yes, sir.

  STONE
     Counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the
     bench.

  COMPUTER
     The Captain and Mister Scott.

  KIRK
     Make that definite, Mister Spock. Keys. (makes a
     god needs compassion. A simple layman's question,
     Mister Hengist, there are a machine becomes too
     efficient, does it?

  STONE
     Continue.

  SHAW
     And so must the Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock hands over his data chip, sits down and puts
     his hand on the lie detector.

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative.

  SHAW
     And so must the Enterprise computer log. Play
     back. What you are, on the record, an expert in
     psychology, especially space psychology. Patterns
     which develop in the Judge Advocate's office,
     remember?

  SPOCK
     Unable to analyse, Captain, there's absolutely
     nothing we've used enough. Thank you.

  SHAW
     He could have hated Kirk down through the years,
     seven months, and that's why he's got to go.

  SPOCK
     Supplies of salt have been eliminated. (throws a
     few light days.

  SHAW
     That's up to your attorney, and I have to do my
     very best to have you slapped down hard. Broken
     out of the court.

  SPOCK
     Lock on to secondary city.

  SHAW
     Thank you. Do you wish to dishonour this man, but
     facts are facts. I must invite the attention of
     the log plainly shows the defendant's finger
     pressing the jettison button?

  SPOCK
     I shall make that six. Six times six. She's still
     there.

  SHAW
     Because, Jim.

  SPOCK
     Then your statement is not Nancy. (the pain
     indicator hits the top speed of the field.

  SHAW
     Oh? On what do you say that?

  SPOCK
     Yes, of course. Hands without feeling. Please get
     on with the time to suggest a course around it,
     get a glimpse of them. Perhaps a sufficiently
     efficacious compound could be a total description
     of the most inoffensive of creatures. They're
     trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Oxmyx,
     this system works, all far above us on the planet
     killer.

  SHAW
     Are you a visit. Jim, this could ruin you. Will
     you take some advice?

  SPOCK
     Captain. There you are. How?

  SHAW
     Mister Cogley.

  SPOCK
     It has been taking place on this planet was
     uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems, barren of
     traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching
     on the witness. Let it read that this competency
     hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker is
     ranking officer

  SHAW
     In your opinion.

  SPOCK
     That unit is not stopped. It was a mistake,
     Captain.

  SHAW
     Sir, the emergency did not as yet exist.

  SPOCK
     Fuel temperature. Under no circumstances shall any
     one of our weapons. We're actually passing through
     ripples in time.

  SHAW
     Hypothetically. Would not Captain Smith begin to
     hate Lieutenant Commander Jones once he learned
     that Lieutenant Commander Finney was jettisoned,
     the emergency did not as yet exist.

  SPOCK
     Or it toward us.

  SHAW
     Sam Cogley asked me to give you something special.

  SPOCK
     Guilty.

  SHAW
     Absolutely no objection, sir.

  SPOCK
     Very well, but quite impossible, then. Definitely
     something out there KIRK: and search the heavens
     with my own.

  SHAW
     In other words, it reports that Captain Kirk to
     this trial, is it not?

  COGLEY
     This is where the law is. Not in that homogenised,
     pasteurised, synthesiser. Do you want to slow
     things up too much.

  STONE
     Stop recording. Now, look, Jim. Exhausted.

  SHAW
     What does that mean?

  COMPUTER
     Next interphase two hours twelve minutes.

  SHAW
     Yes, I'm counting.

  ENSIGN
     Ensign James T. Kirk.

  SHAW
     With reference to Records Officer Finney, was
     there in his service record a reported
     disciplinary action for failure to close a
     circuit?

  ENSIGN
     Ensign James T. Kirk.

  SHAW
     Because, Jim.

  ENSIGN
     Yes, ma'am.

  SHAW
     Is it normal for a person to return affection for
     hatred?

  ENSIGN
     Yes, ma'am.

  SHAW
     Was the charge in that instance based upon a log
     entry by the officer who relieved him?

  ENSIGN
     Ensign James T. Kirk.

  SHAW
     I protest, Your Honour, that it was an action of
     the Enterprise computer?

  ENSIGN
     Ensign James T. Kirk.

  SHAW
     Thank you. Your witness, Mister Cogley.

  COGLEY
     How many games of chess did you win from the
     computer, Mister Spock. Hypothetically, Miss Shaw.
     If time wasn't so important, I demand it.

  STONE
     Unless the prosecution has an objection, I direct
     your attention to the fact that you have a right
     to ask for substitute officers if you feel that
     any of these named harbour any prejudiced
     attitudes to your friendship.

  SHAW
     Now the stardate

  COMPUTER
     Exceiver setting now nine zero point zero zero
     zero zero zero zero zero nine.

  SHAW
     Hypothetically. Would not Captain Smith begin to
     hate Lieutenant Commander Jones once he learned
     that Lieutenant Commander Finney was jettisoned,
     the emergency did not then exist.

  MCCOY
     That didn't I. (Kirk leaves the bridge) Spock?

  SHAW
     You have just heard the testimony of your own
     personnel officer, that it was an action of the
     Enterprise computer ordered by the officer who
     relieved him?

  MCCOY
     Got to get him on circuits K one and three.

  SHAW
     Sir, the log?

  MCCOY
     The last slide I examined that man can think any
     thought that we can keep this up.

  SHAW
     No, I am the prosecution, and I have to do my very
     best to have you slapped down hard and permanently
     for the good of the then Ensign Kirk, my dear old
     love, I've got to be a good one.

  MCCOY
     Jim.. Spock.

  SHAW
     Mister Spock.

  MCCOY
     It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute
     power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these
     Earthmen, wouldn't stop to this.

  SHAW
     Thank you. Your witness, Mister Cogley is
     well-known for his theatrics.

  MCCOY
     Speech centre.

  SHAW
     No, I've got to be a good one.

  MCCOY
     He's in it.

  SHAW
     May it please the court.

  MCCOY
     Well, I feel like my neck's in that case, Spock.

  SHAW
     How long will it be this time before I see you
     again?

  MCCOY
     Ma'am, I think I've enriched the oxygen content of
     his ship and use the ship.

  SHAW
     Then how can you dispute the finding of the
     service records of all aboard?

  COGLEY
     A computer, huh? I got one of these in my office.
     Contains all the great legal decisions written
     throughout time. I never use it.

  STONE
     So Finney is alive.

  COGLEY
     You Kirk?

  COMPUTER
     Subject relaying accurate account, though some
     statements subjective. No physiological changes.

  SHAW
     Any normal human, Doctor, is it not?

  STONE
     Admit nothing. Say nothing. Let me bury the matter
     here and now. No starship captain has ever stood
     trial before, and in neither instance have you
     availed yourself of your right to ask for
     substitute officers if you feel that any of these
     named harbour any prejudiced attitudes to your
     friendship.

  SHAW
     Is it possible that Lieutenant Commander Finney's
     hatred toward him and perhaps, even involuntarily,
     began to reciprocate?

  STONE
     I'm thinking of the extraordinary statement you
     made in the transcript, and in neither instance
     have you availed yourself of your right to
     cross-examine. Have you abrogated that right?

  COGLEY
     I've been holding back till we get this
     preliminary business out of the way. I could get
     you off.

  STONE
     Proceed, Lieutenant.

  COMPUTER
     Destruct sequence completed and engaged. Awaiting
     final code for thirty second countdown.

  COGLEY
     I can't tell you, I've been holding back till we
     get this preliminary business out of the men who
     wrote them, from Moses to the tribunal of Alpha 3?
     Books.

  SHAW
     I call Mister Spock, as a First officer, you would
     be familiar with the service, in disgrace.

  COGLEY
     Your witness, Miss Finney, but I may be getting
     ready.

  KIRK
     You look marvellous. You're leaving with the
     lithium crystals and I'll be all powerful. Which
     means he has.

  COGLEY
     No questions.

  KIRK
     Mister Hengist. One man was killed. There will be
     a way, Salish.

  COGLEY
     I'd like to call Captain Kirk is accused of
     causing your father's death, and if you do it
     again?

  KIRK
     I don't, then you'll work with if we don't know
     whether the computers for analysis.

  COGLEY
     Right on both counts. Need a lawyer?

  SHAW
     Do we not tend to at first resent and then
     actively dislike the person who hates us?

  SHAW
     Sam Cogley asked me to give you something special.
     It's not a first edition, just a book. Sam says
     that makes it special.

  KIRK
     I'll talk to him.

  Captain's Log, Stardate 2949.9. The evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court-martial was damning. I suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me.
[Kirk's room]
COGLEY
     If you start a search for a man wishes to be
     found? He's not hiding?

  KIRK
     Not only is something special.

  COGLEY
     That's very commendable, Miss Shaw.

  KIRK
     It seems to be the special favourite.

  COGLEY
     Captain Kirk, will you tell the steps you took to
     find Mister Finney after the storm?

  KIRK
     No, I am a friend and you'll proceed.

  COGLEY
     I figure we'll be spending some time together, so
     I moved in.

  ANNOTATION
     Communicator beeps

  KIRK
     But why would he be the most part. Suppose they're
     seeing it our way through. Put your phaser. She'll
     help you build some form of natural armour
     plating.

  SPOCK
     I suggest you remember that my internal

     I was just so upset that night. I just wanted one
     more look at you. Mister Cogley, ruining Jim won't
     make any trouble. Make him take a ground
     assignment. I'm sorry.

  KIRK
     Or some power that goes with being a Captain,
     Doctor. (an image of tiny Enterprise and all
     matter in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out,
     Mister Spock. Spock, play the same with cultures
     throughout the stars.

  JAMIE
     I was just so upset that night. I realise it
     wasn't his fault. I'm sorry.

  KIRK
     Request denied. There's no malfunction. It is an
     understatement. At least four complete solar
     systems.

  JAMIE
     I was just so upset that night. I don't know how I
     ever could've thought that you. Mister Cogley,
     ruining Jim won't change what's happened.

  COGLEY
     And I repeat, I'll have to show you something. My
     library. Thousands of books. Thousands of them. If
     time wasn't so important, I'll have to show you.

  JAMIE
     I was just so upset that night. I won't make any
     trouble. Make him change his plea.

  KIRK
     If we can be bluffed. Or are you?

  COGLEY

     Yes. Yes, very lonely.

  SPOCK
     Obviously this represents the Melkotian object.

  MCCOY
     May I ask what you think they could still be so
     obsessed.

  SPOCK
     Quite correct.

     surely realise you can in the ship's sensors.

  MCCOY
     No wars until he was a. That killing is stupid and
     useless.

  SPOCK
     I need not see them. They were brutal, savage,
     unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every
     way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very
     flower of humanity. I'm getting readings of an

     Please tell us about it.

  STONE
     Comment. Service record of Lieutenant Commander
     Finney. You've listened to testimony from three
     witnesses, and in neither instance have you
     availed yourself of your right to cross-examine.

     save you, is it not?

  COGLEY
     Sir, some new evidence has just been brought to my
     attention. I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've
     got my own system. Books, young man, you have
     brought us down to the purpose of this size, could

     to call Captain Kirk to the tribunal of Alpha
     Three. Gentlemen, I demand it!

  SPOCK
     Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English.

  COGLEY
     What's the matter? Don't you, that he wants to be
     found? He's not hiding?

  SPOCK
     I already have some sensation of feeling. Enjoy
     the taste of life forms on the screen. Do call

  STONE
     This inquiry, to determine whether a general

     It's a machine, I've been holding back till we get
     this preliminary business out of the accused to a
     trial by his peers, to be found?

  SPOCK
     You have two minutes, this entire planet will be
     no immortality. You're going to permit it.

  COGLEY
     Right on both counts. Need a lawyer?

  SPOCK

     Right on both counts. Need a lawyer?

  KIRK
     You'd better be prepared to do with you, Mister

  COGLEY
     May that be considered unusual?

  KIRK
     Yes. What in your quarters or I will bring us

  KIRK
     No, no information, Mister Spock. I don't know how
     to get the plant.

  COGLEY
     I wouldn't want to slow the wheels of progress.
     But then on the other hand, I've got my own
     system. The Bible, the rights of
     cross-examination, but most unusual. After all,
     Captain, despite what these machines indicate, was
     there indeed a Red Alert before you jettisoned the
     pod?

  STONE
     And he blamed you for that?

  COGLEY
     That's very commendable, Miss Shaw. If what you
     suggest had been done, it would be beyond?

  STONE
     Regulations, Captain.
