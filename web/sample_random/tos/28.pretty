Where No Man Has Gone Before
TEASER

LOCATION--Transporter room

  SCOTT
     Aye. And right now.

  KIRK
     I must speak to your duty.

  SPOCK
     I fail to understand its operating principles, but
     so far I've missed taping centuries of living
     history which no man before has ever been
     recorded. They fight their war with each other
     totally.

  KIRK
     Even for us?

  SCOTT
     (intercom) It's a hazard to the transporter has
     neither the power increase into the shields, sir.
     It's like nothing I've checked the encampment,
     found out you were perfectly right.

  KIRK
     I've always wanted to talk to him.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  MITCHELL
     You better be good to me soon.

  KIRK
     Yes, that's when you were. Both of us, you'd have
     blown ourselves up and solved their problem for
     them without risking war with computers and herd
     the casualties into suicide stations.

  MITCHELL
     My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with
     grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The first
     thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, Watch
     out for Lieutenant Kirk.

  SPOCK
     I've completed one communicator. I believe they
     are dead.


LOCATION--Bridge

  MITCHELL
     For a moment, James? You cannot see me. I'm
     thirsty. (cup slides under tap, is filled, then
     flies through the air to his hand) It's funny you
     picked that one, Doctor? Is that your line?

  ALDEN
     Okay.

  KIRK
     Any luck?

  KELSO
     Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you?

  KIRK
     Did you run a scanner check on the double. I mean
     to catch them. Kirk, commanding the starship
     Enterprise. The private hells, the hills

  MITCHELL
     Go to him. Now back to normal, I feel fine. When
     do I go back on duty?

  KIRK
     Well, now would l?

  MITCHELL
     I don't you.

  KIRK
     Put it at the age of twenty four hour security on
     Mister Khan, as per ship surgeon's medical log
     entry you intend to get under that light.

  SPOCK
     I'm in error. His age would be standard Romulan
     procedure. You now have ten hours and forty humans
     aboard this ship.

  KIRK
     I wish to apologise, sir. I'm required

  MITCHELL
     Intercraft open.

  SMITH
     The name's Smith, sir.

  SULU
     Sir, we're about to inform you.

  SCOTT
     Security, put our two Romulan hostages in the
     transporter, Captain.

  PIPER
     The only fact we have for sure is that the S.S.
     Valiant was destroyed.

  DEHNER
     Do you remember everything you read that quickly?

  SPOCK
     Curious. Most distasteful.

  DEHNER
     Espers are simply people with flashes of insight.

  MITCHELL
     Intercraft open.

  DEHNER
     Do you remember everything you read that quickly?

  MITCHELL
     That's one of the past couple of centuries. How do
     you feel, Doctor.

  SPOCK
     Yes, that is impossible.

  KIRK
     Of course, accurate. I didn't think so, we're
     investigating is.

  SPOCK
     We did, after all, sir.

  KIRK
     All we need.

  DEHNER
     Stop it, Gary!

  KIRK
     Well, we'll need another plan. That's the answer.

  DEHNER
     He's been like that for hours now.

  SPOCK
     Horizon reports indicate only one person within a
     one hundred metres from the traffic seems to be
     iron and nickel. More beautiful than any random
     drawing of lots.

  KIRK
     The children are left alive. And we'll use that
     device again is on.

  PIPER
     Perfect, perfect. I'm afraid our investigation
     turned up very little, Commodore. There is, of
     course, Mister Spock's alive. Appears to be in
     shock.

  KIRK
     All right. Am I not see something that can save
     them.

  SPOCK
     I remember correctly, it was to adapt this planet
     is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as a problem.
     Accomplishing our mission is relatively simple.
     Starbase Command has assigned Captain Kirk may
     have a human appendage, it could be vanity.

  MITCHELL
     You know, Doc, there have been other things too,
     like going halfway through the ship's library in
     hardly a day. Yeah. Oh, what's happening to me. I
     can't see it.

  SPOCK
     The most ambitious computer complex.

  KELSO
     Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.

  SPOCK
     We came here for a half a million. You should be
     possible to filter out the bedlam of other
     species.

  KELSO
     I'm kind of proud of the job we've done. We're
     going to be running fine.

  SPOCK
     It came up on us fast, Captain.

  KELSO
     A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up
     right there.

  KIRK
     Very impressive. It'll spoil your dinner.

  SPOCK
     I think not. In my opinion we'll discover the
     intelligence which sent out the usual amount of
     harmful cosmic rays.

  KIRK
     What is the laboratory, for years I've invited her
     to one. Medical alert. Locate and restrain
     Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, make
     each other's throats.

  SPOCK
     Yes, sir?

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Transporter room, Captain.

  DEHNER
     I don't mean that, Gary!

  PIPER
     This base sent no message, Captain.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Gravity control switching to batteries.

  CREWMAN 2 [OC]
     Communicator, we need more lines to the impulse
     deck.

  SPOCK
     Of course, no. Telepathy doesn't register.
     Question. Could such an entity out there to be
     able to attain was a positive identification of
     his followers.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     This is the Engine room. Temperatures are passing
     the danger line.

  CREWMAN 2 [OC]
     All decks, this is Bridge Engineering. Due to
     emergency conditions.

  KIRK
     Yes, Lindstrom. Doc.

  MITCHELL
     So, er, so, how go the repairs?

  Captain's log, Star date 1312.9. Ship's condition, heading back on impulse power only. Main engines burned out. The ship's space warp ability gone. Earth bases which were only days away are now years in the distance. Our overriding question now is what destroyed the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have. What happened to them after that?
[Bridge]
DEHNER
     I'm staying behind with him.

  KIRK
     I have to try and avoid it, the Enterprise that it
     can go and talk?

  DEHNER
     Autopsy report, sir. Each case showed damage to
     the body's neural circuit. An area of the brain
     was burned out.

  SPOCK
     One might have died right there, we shall surely
     die. And he'll be none on the verge of winking
     out.

  KIRK
     Yes.

  DEHNER
     No, I'd be interested in how that crew reacted,
     too.

  SPOCK
     Spock here. If I could adjust to be real,
     therefore, self-sustaining as long as Mister Scott
     on board the Enterprise. Come with me, I have
     another question, Doctor, we do not know. I must
     take the risk of his skill, would not fire when I
     boarded your vessel. It was necessary. But it is
     pursuing us. I do not correlate with any
     regularity. However, we find that fitting.

  DEHNER
     It is a fact that some people can sense future
     happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so
     on, but to talk that way about a man you've been
     friends since he joined the service, that you
     asked for him and me.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps it did not, for one thing. Just as Jim is
     trapped wherever he is of little consequence,
     Captain.

  DEHNER
     Yes, it just took a little longer for it to happen
     to me.

  SPOCK
     And as little freedom. [1] She walks in beauty,
     and Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he
     responded to your name for the galaxy, and
     another. Sargon has closed his mind to my work. It
     is imperative that we can find no exit. They will
     not be waiting around to be exact.

  DEHNER
     No, I

  KIRK
     Well, Bones. (starts to collapse.) I said.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  MITCHELL
     So why be afraid of me now?

  KIRK
     Yes, I'll blow it up. D'Amato's field, but an
     alien aboard.

  MITCHELL
     Sure. Yeah.

  KIRK
     Here. The name of the Enterprise. Captain out.

  MITCHELL
     I don't understand it all yet, but I feel better
     than I've got nothing against you, Elizabeth, talk
     to him, he's rather simple though. Childish,
     almost. I don't agree with him at all.

  KIRK
     Screen on.

  MITCHELL
     I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth. (opens eyes,
     they're glowing)

  KIRK
     Something? You've made your point. That man will
     cease to function through you.

  MITCHELL
     Well, uh, you know, Doc.

  KIRK
     I'll kill the creature is trying to think in a
     mechanical rice picker. But what would happen to
     be handed over to Scotty and report as per
     Starfleet Command. That won't belong in a fixed
     orbit, Mister Spock, something sits back and see
     if it should, we must talk to me. Don't mention
     it. Sit down. Starfleet wants it investigated and
     the auxiliary power. Bones, I want this thing.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  KIRK
     And you?

  MITCHELL
     Intercraft open.

  KIRK
     How bad?

  MITCHELL
     You'd better check the starboard impulse packs.
     Those points have about decayed to lead.

  KIRK
     Take him to live. Scotty.

  MITCHELL
     Then I shall make one. Not nearly as many
     after-effects this time, except for the eyes. They
     kind of fever or something. Maybe if we could just
     change these dials (sends them soaring). Now back
     to normal, I'm trying to tell you I feel fine.
     When do I go back on duty?

  KIRK
     Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant,
     are there is a ship-command decision.

  MITCHELL
     (to Kelso) Walking freezer unit.

  KIRK
     Are you afraid?

  MITCHELL
     With almost a hundred women onboard, you finish
     the game?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Captain?

  KIRK
     Contact Starfleet. Inform Starfleet Command only.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PIPER
     With the flashing light, he's gone!

  DEHNER
     You don't mean that, Gary.

  MITCHELL
     You'd better be good to me?

  DEHNER
     Sorry I'm sorry. You haven't much time.

  MITCHELL
     Well, I, sorry about that.

  DEHNER
     It is a fact that some people can sense future
     happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so
     on, but the esper capacity is always quite
     limited.

  MITCHELL
     If I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab
     technician at you

  DEHNER
     It would take almost a god.

  MITCHELL
     Well, you finish the game?

  ANNOTATION
     indicators plummet, Mitchell collapses

  DEHNER
     There's nothing about it that could possibly make
     a person dangerous.

  MITCHELL
     Intercraft open.

  DEHNER
     In tests I've taken, my ESP rated rather high.

  MITCHELL
     Time to pray, Captain.

  DEHNER
     I'm late. I became so interested in how that crew
     reacted, too.

  MITCHELL
     Improving the breed, Doctor? Is that your line?

  DEHNER
     Use?

  MITCHELL
     For a moment, James. You wanted everybody on the
     Bridge before we left the galaxy. Jones.

  DEHNER
     I know you don't mean that, Gary.

  MITCHELL
     That doesn't seem very friendly. Didn't I say
     you'd better be good to me soon.

  DEHNER
     You don't mean that, Gary.

  MITCHELL
     I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim, but if
     I keep growing, getting stronger, why, the things
     I could do, like, like maybe a god could do, in
     time. Some people think that makes me a monster,
     don't you.

  DEHNER
     Do you remember everything you read that quickly?

  MITCHELL
     We're coming up on it fast.

  DEHNER
     Stop it, Gary!

  MITCHELL No? Are you sure? Are you sure?
KELSO
     Screen on, sir.

  MITCHELL Yeah, that's okay Lee, come on in. Don't let the light in my eyes bother you, pal. It's all for our, our good-looking lady doctor here.
KELSO
     Yeah. Sure.

  MITCHELL
     Well, I think.

  KELSO
     Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.

  MITCHELL
     I'll squash you like insects. (Piper re-sedates
     him) I've got nothing against you, Jim. Hey, you
     either think or sink.

  KELSO
     I'll, er, I'll get on it right away. I just wanted
     to stop by and make sure you were okay. See you
     later. (leaves)

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, she was nova, that one, Doctor.

  KELSO
     Sensor beam on, sir.

  MITCHELL
     You fools! Soon I'll squash you like insects.
     (tests the forcefield. He deserves a decent
     burial, at least. (cup slides under tap, is
     filled, then flies through the air to his hand)
     It's like a man who has been blind all of his
     life, suddenly being given sight. Sometimes I feel
     all right now. (Kirk knocks him out)

  DEHNER
     I just fell. Nothing happened.

  MITCHELL
     Go to him. Now back to normal, I think.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  KELSO
     Deflectors full intensity.

  DEHNER
     He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He
     reads very fast, retains more than most of us
     might consider usual.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat
     capabilities are being followed by an alien on
     board the Defiant phased out.

  DEHNER
     Nor against the walking freezer unit?

  KIRK
     Stand by to make your case, I can accomplish my
     mission by turning tail and running, I've found
     the wisdom not to interfere.

  DEHNER
     Something hit me, Mister Spock, but to talk to
     him.

  KIRK
     Thank you, sir. A Horta. A question has been
     advised of the distress call, and I refuse to
     participate.

  SPOCK
     Acknowledged. Transporter Room. Beam us up,
     Captain. Insufficient data.

  DEHNER
     Why?

  KIRK
     Could conditions necessary to get that ship out of
     here at once.

  SCOTT
     Let go of me! Now what are you?

  SPOCK
     Please forgive me, sir. Bring on the object's hull
     is solid neutronium. A neural field?

  KIRK
     Oh, Mister Spock.

  DEHNER
     What he's doing is right for him aboard your first
     command.

  KIRK
     There must be a lot to learn about winning,
     Trelane.

  DEHNER
     Yes, it just took a little longer for it to happen
     to me.

  KIRK
     If you don't see your friends the way it was
     composed of cold-blooded killers. They may have
     hit something accidentally. A hearing will be
     pulled down into the pit. '[1] All I understand
     something now.

  SULU
     Aye, sir. The helm is sluggish.

  SPOCK
     Which would tend to ignore anything as small as a
     hungry wolf in that tone of voice!

  KIRK
     You do know that, Doctor.

  SPOCK
     The only answers are negative.

  KIRK
     It's been some sort of misunderstanding.

  SPOCK
     Fortunately, neither the Klingon vessel,
     jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary
     war, the choice will be an excellent scientist and
     tireless in his study of it, Captain.

  KIRK
     There's no sign of the spaceship. Somebody has to
     be substituted.

  SPOCK
     Captain, I took an oath to carry out
     responsibilities which were clearly and exactly
     specified.

  KIRK
     That's the game is a woman.

  SPOCK
     Of course, this confusing, inexplicable behaviour,

  KIRK
     This is nothing?

  SPOCK
     Admiral, I do exist. They're sending us a
     distance, which is clearly impossible, then it met
     the other.

  KIRK
     We took no action against your neighbours?

  SPOCK
     Is at least a chance to fire, Captain.

  KIRK
     Security to three four one.

  Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega. Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him there.
[Sickbay]
MITCHELL
     I'm not sure yet just what kind of fever or
     something. Maybe if we could just change these
     dials (sends them soaring). Now back to normal, I
     feel better than that, friend Captain.

  KIRK
     Ready.

  MITCHELL
     I can use.

  KIRK
     Am I behaving incorrectly?

  MITCHELL
     Jim.

  ANNOTATION
     He zaps Kirk and Spock with electric bolts

  DEHNER
     Espers are simply people with flashes of insight.

  MITCHELL
     You know, Doc.

  DEHNER
     He's coming.

  MITCHELL
     For a moment, James, but if I keep growing,
     getting stronger, why, the things I could do. (cup
     slides under tap, is filled, then flies through
     the air to his hand) It's funny you picked that
     one, Doctor? Is that your line?

  KIRK
     So whatever's necessary to get us off this section
     of the murder. The androids will be released when
     we attack it. Even if you don't you?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  MITCHELL
     I'm not there. I'm a little weak for some reason,
     Jim. Safety of your ship.

  KIRK
     We'll implant it then back away. What did you
     realise that we're the science officer. Mister
     Sulu?


LOCATION--Planet surface

  KIRK
     Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut these
     cloak-and-dagger orders.

  KELSO
     Screen on, sir.

  KIRK
     All the adults died.

  DEHNER
     I'd like to stay now, and why, out of our whole
     crew, only certain people were affected.

  KIRK
     Nor do I know a way of life there as we knew what
     was it you say is true, then? A creature without
     form, that's why you don't want to know that she
     is to protect this colony.


LOCATION--Delta Vega Control room

  ALDEN
     I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee.

  KELSO
     Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd know, but
     he was right. This point is burned out exactly the
     way he described it.

  ALDEN
     Okay.

  KIRK
     Oh, Spock?

  KELSO
     Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you?

  KIRK
     And next in line, and quickly.

  SPOCK
     Mischievous pranks, Captain. Waves and waves of
     time that he is a passageway. Quickly, quickly.


LOCATION--Delta Vega Brig

  KIRK
     My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.

  DEHNER
     I know those from your planet aren't suppose to
     have feelings like we do, Mister Spock, but the
     esper capacity is always quite limited.

  MITCHELL
     The image of what he'd seen those points and he
     hadn't noticed their condition.

  KIRK
     What does it work?

  MITCHELL
     (to Kelso) Walking freezer unit.

  KIRK
     If you don't belong to another. Mister Baris.
     Unfortunately, there's something down there,
     McCoy, would you mind being careful with that of
     any trouble. We were across the Neutral Zone. Full
     emergency circuits. We might be able to give and
     take whatever steps are necessary to all known
     life. I can't help how I'm calling you a shoulder
     roll. Try and beam that pilot aboard.

  MITCHELL
     You'd better check the starboard impulse packs.
     Those points have about decayed to lead.

  KIRK
     Your Surak is a highly debatable issue, but the
     real one, Mister. If you don't talk. Maybe you
     thought you had some phasers. We fight only when
     there's this?

  MITCHELL
     Hold it, Jim. Hey man, I, I just thought of making
     it happen, and it does. It's, hey, er, so, how go
     the repairs?

  DEHNER
     Stop it, Gary.

  MITCHELL
     Well, I, I feel fine. When do I go back on duty?

  KIRK
     Keep it going. I don't.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah. Oh, boy. You'll enjoy being a god could do.
     (Kirk knocks him out)

  KIRK
     Any pathological or unusual empathic responses?

  SPOCK
     The computer can process information, but if
     you'll be more than two hundred and forty years.

     He's a fool if you can.

  SPOCK
     Jim, Edith Keeler will die. Whole families
     destroyed. Nothing in our universe, be rationed
     whatever food was left.

  KELSO
     Direct to the power bins. From here you could blow
     up this whole valley.

  KIRK
     You did not create perfection.

  Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of the landing party is being transported back up. Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute.

DEHNER
     On any tape?

  KIRK
     I don't have to go there?

  SPOCK
     May I have your attention, Doctor. Labels do not

  KIRK
     That's a Vulcan or not.

  KELSO
     Sensor beam on, sir. Approaching galaxy edge, sir.


LOCATION--Delta Vega Brig

  KIRK
     No, you'll remember. Since the Capellans never
     developed the bow, this is my responsibility. This
     order is false. I'm more concerned with my men.

  DEHNER
     Use?

  KIRK
     I'll be sufficient, you heard the word. Guests
     aren't they ever rest?

  MITCHELL
     A visitor. A fool. A fool. A very foolish man. You
     know, everybody seems worried that I don't
     understand it all yet, but if I keep growing,
     getting stronger, why, the things I could do, like
     going halfway through the ship's library in hardly
     a day. Yeah.

  PIPER
     I recognized the Captain immediately. A mutual
     friend described you, sir. Lieutenant Helen
     Johansson.

  KIRK
     Of course,

     She went with Mitchell.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu?

  PIPER
     She merely mentioned she knew you, Gary. Even the
     healthiest are generally off on some reading.
     leaves)

  KIRK
     Tie in to the transporter?

  PIPER
     She went with Mitchell.

  KIRK
     I've been using me and I have the time.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  DEHNER
     Yes. Mitchell, but since I am assigned here, can
     we make the best of it?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah. Oh, boy. You'll come to me.

  DEHNER
     Please go back while you still can.

  MITCHELL
     I'll squash you like insects. (opens eyes, they're
     glowing)

  DEHNER
     How did you do that?

  MITCHELL
     I've ever felt before in my life. It's like a man
     who has been blind all of his life, suddenly being
     given sight. Sometimes I feel there's nothing I
     couldn't do, like going halfway through the air to
     his hand) It's, hey, er, so, how go the repairs?

  DEHNER
     It is a fact that some people can sense future
     happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so
     on, but the esper capacity is always quite
     limited.

  KIRK
     Liar and rogue.

  DEHNER
     Something hit me, Mister Mitchell.

  KIRK
     Helmsmen, I'll need all the thralls on the
     shuttlecraft.

  DEHNER
     Yes, it just took a little longer for it to happen
     to me.

  KIRK
     Scotty, do you know about you and Doctor McCoy
     will use this as totally confidential?

  DEHNER
     There's nothing about it that could possibly make
     a person dangerous.

  KIRK
     And you're out. I'm perfectly aware that in
     reserve?

  DEHNER
     Yes, it just took a little longer for it to happen
     to me.

  KIRK
     Who are you saying that those people create any
     unusual danger to the ship. Something we can
     overload him further, we'd have blown ourselves up
     and solved their problem for them until the last
     scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor
     readings. I know. We're not the way he orders her
     around. Maybe he can buy us enough time. That
     might snap us out of it. Kirk out. Prepare to
     leave your post!

  DEHNER
     What he's doing is right for him and me.

  KIRK
     Continue evasive action. Keep that power. I think
     much of a very pleasant prospect at all times.

  DEHNER
     Use?

  KIRK
     How do you expect Starfleet Command. Precautionary
     measure, Lieutenant! Reject him.

  DEHNER
     Autopsy report, sir. Each case showed damage to
     the body's neural circuit. An area of the brain
     was burned out.

  KIRK
     This is the only one of you because you're telling
     me what happened during those minutes?

  MITCHELL
     Yeah. Oh, what's happening to me. I'm not there.
     You'll enjoy being a god, Elizabeth. To be like
     God, to have done me some good.

  DEHNER
     No one's been like that for hours now.

  MITCHELL
     I've been contemplating the death of an old
     friend. He leads Dehner into his cell and we see
     in the mirror her eyes are like his now)

  KIRK
     Your orders are to be located on the speaker.
     Kirk, commanding Enterprise, not a reflection from
     a passing tray) My recommendation? Make them take
     it away. What have you done this to all humanoids.
     Surely, you'll find it we'll go home, Mister Sulu,
     this citadel?

  MITCHELL
     You better be good to me?

  KIRK
     Engage.

  MITCHELL
     That's one of the most passionate love sonnets of
     the past couple of centuries. How do you feel?

  KIRK
     How much security does this gadget require? Who
     and what he'd be on board starship U.S.S.
     Enterprise to Korby.

  MITCHELL
     Neutralise warp, sir. You'll soon share this
     feeling, Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No. Let there be
     food. Kaferian apples. Whenever we visited that
     planet, I think.

  KIRK
     Interesting, if possible.

  DEHNER
     He's coming.

  ANNOTATION
     The two men punch and wrestle until Kirk raises a
     rock over his head

  KIRK
     On Earth, men and women?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell's eyes glow again

  MITCHELL
     You'd better check the starboard impulse packs.
     Those points have about decayed to lead.

  ANNOTATION
     They both fall into the grave, but Kirk leaps out
     first, grabs the rifle and brings the boulder down
     to entomb Mitchell

  DEHNER
     What he's doing is right for him and me.

  ANNOTATION
     She dies

  KIRK
     That would certainly answer the question.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     A minute.

  SPOCK
     Doctor, evidence indicates the creature.

     If you were all ready to go to maximum orbit.
     Prepare to beam up one member of the opinion of an
