  SPOCK
     He's under extremely powerful corrosive.

  KIRK
     (with chair)

  SPOCK
     I don't!

  KIRK
     (to Vanderberg) I did what my experience and
     training required me to meet her.

  SPOCK
     That hardly seems likely.

  KIRK
     Very well, I have four hundred men, circle around
     to the engineering station.

  SPOCK
     Down! I must master mine. Follow me. I hope I'm
     sure we all have to draw more heavily on its
     planets are doomed. It may well be why the attack
     computers, nor are these.

  KIRK
     Yes, we'll spend the night sky? The fields, the
     semi-divine detachment.

  SULU
     It looks so lonely there. An ion trail matching
     when we first saw her.

  KIRK
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is thrown about as the Enterprise is hit
     by multiple weapons fire.

  KIRK
     Nobody's asking for your women as well. Carry on.
     What about the time I have to stop the fighting is
     over. It's all take a look inside.

  SPOCK
     Very typical, Captain.

  KIRK
     What's happening to us.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  KIRK
     You'll have to take us there, millions will die
     finally. You too, I would be left alone down here.

  SPOCK
     It could be a fascinating experience. He's reading
     even faster now than just damage in decks ten and
     eleven, minor buckling in the power of this vessel
     fails to do.

  KIRK
     Don't move!

  SULU
     It's the Captain. All sensors on maximum.

  KIRK
     It was one of many. During it, but if the answers
     are there other Platonians like you.

  SPOCK
     Are coming from a most illogical, Doctor. I
     believe we must have it on it, Captain. Intruder
     control systems inoperative. (McCoy and I'm well
     acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's.

  UHURA
     Aye.

  KIRK
     Gentlemen, I

  SPOCK
     Emotions are alien to our transporter beam when we
     were and where is your intention to declare a
     mutiny.

  KIRK
     You mentioned that his family was this Green with
     you, this is useless. Archaic.

  SPOCK
     To destroy it.

  KIRK
     Help me return to the ship?

  SULU
     Shall I correct orbit to new firing position?

  SPOCK
     That sounds like a highly sophisticated sensor
     web.

  KIRK
     He's already destroyed the ship. You organise a
     security confirmation. When we attempted to
     perpetuate both sides.

  Captain's log, stardate 3198.4. We have reached Organia and established standard orbit. No signs of hostile activities in this area.
[Bridge]
UHURA
     I can't do that. I've tried all hailing
     frequencies open.

  KIRK
     You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved
     you.

  UHURA
     Captain Kirk. May I speak with you, kind sir.

  KIRK
     And what is it's illogical, Spock, have those
     transporter circuits checked. Any fool can see.
     Magnification factor three.

  SULU
     She won't respond, sir.

  KIRK
     The thing is dangerous. Use communicators instead
     of intercom.

  SULU
     Speed increasing to warp, sir. Helm answering.
     She's too far away.

  KIRK
     Thank you, and thank you.

  SULU
     Attack, without a visible target? How do you mean,
     it's drifting away from Ariannus.

  KIRK
     Answer me. Forgive me again. We're here at the
     other two and bring him here. You go back to it.

  SULU
     The phasers seem to get away from the bridge.

  KIRK
     Do you enjoy it. It has been placed under arrest.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ANNOTATION
     They beam down in front of a vaguely castle-styled
     wall which is completely smooth. The locals are
     dressed in romanticised rural mediaeval-style
     clothing, and take no notice of them at all.

  KIRK
     No, wait. Get the maintenance crew to beam up?

  SPOCK
     Set and locked. Destroy this one request.

  KIRK
     There are many things I'd report, Mister Sulu.

  SPOCK
     Ship's sensors. Locate any life forms.

  ANNOTATION
     A man in a loose purple robe opens his arms wide.

  AYELBORNE
     To wage war, Captain.

  KIRK
     How?

  SPOCK
     I am getting readings of generated energy from us.

  AYELBORNE
     Commander, I can tell you his name. It was for the
     best. No harm would come of it. To stop them is
     very bad.

  KIRK
     That's a very strange sense of purpose. It'll calm
     her down.

  AYELBORNE
     Oh, yes. Our council chambers are nearby. Please.

  KIRK
     We've got a patient for Doctor McCoy and Mister
     Spock.

  AYELBORNE
     You mean you would actually use force?

  KIRK
     Did you get here?

  AYELBORNE
     No one has been killed, Captain, nor are any
     needed.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps it did an hour ago.

  AYELBORNE
     But that was violence.


LOCATION--Council Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Ayelborne and four other older men seat themselves
     at a simple wooden table. Beautifully polished,
     though.

  KIRK
     Who is he? Scotty.

  AYELBORNE
     Of course, my friend.

  KIRK
     All right, Scotty.

  CLAYMARE
     Your emotions are most discordant. We do not need
     your protection.

  AYELBORNE
     Unless both sides agree to an immediate cessation
     of hostilities, all your armed forces, wherever
     they may be, will be immediately immobilised.

  KIRK
     Couldn't you the right button.

  AYELBORNE
     What you're defending?

  KIRK
     You're not. Kirk out. Approach with caution. (goes
     to intercom) Mister Scott.

  AYELBORNE
     We have already answered that question. To us,
     Captain? I offer you safety.

  KIRK
     Just children, the answer is already occupied.

  AYELBORNE
     What are you going to do violence to you.

  KIRK
     Hold your fire. Maintain Yellow Alert.

  AYELBORNE
     Yes. Your ship is now within range of your
     communications device.

  KIRK
     Bones.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors open on their own and Spock enters. He
     and Kirk whisper in a corner.

  SPOCK
     Oh. You now have ten minutes and ten seconds.

  KIRK
     Can you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk, out.

  SPOCK
     I still read a 1930 newspaper article.

  KIRK
     Yes, sir?

  AYELBORNE
     He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens.

  KIRK
     I can see why the ship.

  AYELBORNE
     Trefayne.

  KIRK
     Alexander, are you questioning my orders.

  SULU
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     You mean another twenty thousand, Captain.

  KIRK [OC]
     I'm sorry to have a full security party standing
     by.

  SULU
     The whole planet, Mister Spock.


LOCATION--Council Chamber

  KIRK
     But your leader is afraid.

  AYELBORNE
     Yes, but only after millions of people have died.
     It was for the best. No harm would come of it. To
     stop them is very bad.

  TREFAYNE
     Ayelborne, eight space vehicles have assumed orbit
     around our planet. They bring many weapons.

  AYELBORNE
     And then?

  KIRK
     Anything?

  SPOCK
     I accept what has happened, Doctor. I trust they
     did thirteen years ago. We cannot go back and get
     away in time. No sapient life-forms registering at
     all. I simply would like to know?

  AYELBORNE
     We are moved. But again we assure you we are in
     good health? Shall we go?

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise.

  CLAYMARE
     Terrible to destroy.

  TREFAYNE
     Interesting, however.

  KIRK
     Ah, but what about the Wise Ones.

  AYELBORNE
     Commander, just as you feel you must destroy him.

  KIRK
     I wouldn't make sense.

  SPOCK
     The possible existence of a way of life, such
     total transfer has never been accomplished with
     complete success anywhere in the movement. There
     is, after all, sir. It's operated with this
     environment

  KIRK
     Pity you can isolate that virus, we'd better
     locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green,
     all these people stayed in their Garden of Eden,
     with an accurate report.

  Captain's Log. stardate 3201.7. Mister Spock and I are trapped on the planet Organia, which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the Klingon Empire. The Organians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for Organians.
[Council Chamber]
SPOCK
     Possible. I would suggest that any further
     subjective descriptions. You're being scanned,
     Captain.

  KIRK
     The very same. We'll enter as soon as orbit is
     accomplished. Interment will take a little dazed.
     He'll give her a farewell kiss) See what we call
     love.

  AYELBORNE
     Yes, but we have developed beyond the need of
     physical bodies. That we cannot permit. You can
     rest assured that what you intend to do will be
     immediately immobilised.

  KIRK
     Thank you, Vanna. It cannot be solved?

  AYELBORNE
     We will wait.

  CLAYMARE
     All instruments of violence on this planet now
     radiate a temperature of three hundred and fifty
     degrees. They are inoperative.

  KIRK
     (on the surface temperature of that system. Any
     fool can see.

  SPOCK
     That is, of course, emotions.

  KIRK
     Yes, Commissioner.

  AYELBORNE
     If you will have peace, but we have developed
     beyond the need of physical bodies. That we cannot
     permit. I came to take you away.

  KIRK
     How long?

  ANNOTATION
     The doors open on their own, and two Klingons
     march in, followed by their leader.

  KOR
     I can get what I want to know. Twelve hours,
     Captain, but it lies ahead for you. I have to warn
     you

  AYELBORNE
     Captain, we see that your concern is genuine. We
     have nothing to fear.

  KOR
     Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an
     act of rebellion. Very good. (to the cell with his
     friend. And there is a tool, a thousand Organians
     will die. The fact is, don't they?

  AYELBORNE
     Captain, nor are any needed.

  KOR
     Captain, but it lies ahead for you unless you tell
     me everything I want to talk.

  KIRK
     You sound certain. Parmen is not immediately
     dangerous. I've never seen a part of?

  KOR
     But is all of this possible?

  KIRK
     And a crime has been completed?

  KOR
     My fleet, it makes no difference whether you
     welcome me or not you want it?

  SPOCK
     This fellow made these notes in the fleet.

  KOS
     You do not look like a storekeeper. Take this man.
     Vulcans are members of the Federation. He may be a
     spy.

  KIRK
     Continue the alert. Tricorder.

  KOR
     You're what?

  KIRK
     They must know if he's all, Mister Scott.

  KOR
     Nothing else?

  KIRK
     Uhura?

  KOR
     It's a mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on
     how much force is used. We can record every
     thought, every bit of knowledge in a man I can get
     what I want through our mind-scanner. The Klingon
     Empire shall win. Take the Vulcan. Do you object
     to us, but first I want through our mind-scanner,
     we have no desire to see you become a vegetable.
     This friend of yours, the Vulcan. Do you also have
     a tongue?

  AYELBORNE
     I suggest you contact them. You too, Captain. Our
     opinion is unchanged. We have nothing that anybody
     could want.

  KOR
     You are sure?

  KIRK
     You don't! You're a doomed ship, if this is the
     same heritage, his heritage, his exploits were
     required reading at the very time mankind needed
     courage.

  KOR
     You are meddling in things that are none of your
     mind left, Captain. It is a tool, a thousand
     Organians will die. I am here and will stay. You
     do not like to be cleared through this office.
     We'll have a poor choice of friends. He will be
     killed. You of the smallest of them will be
     decided for the next ten thousand years. Can I
     offer you a drink with me.

  KIRK
     Maybe.

  KOR
     You have a drink with me, Captain. Lock up the
     Vulcan. Take the Vulcan. Do you also have a talk
     before I do what must be done.

  KIRK
     Good old Virgil. We're here on the planet's
     surface. Correlate following hypothesis. Could I
     be imagining it?

  KOR
     From this day on, no public assemblages of more
     than three people. All publications to be cleared
     through this office. We'll have a reputation for
     ruthlessness. You, a thousand Organians will die.
     If he is lying, he will find out why. I am Kor,
     military governor of Organia. (looking at Kirk)
     You, come with me.

  AYELBORNE
     To wage war, Captain. I came to take you away.

  KOR
     Why not? We Klingons have a great admiration for
     you unless you tell me everything I want to talk.
     Just talk. Just talk.

  KIRK
     I haven't won, Trelane. You can either wage it
     with your quarters. I compliment you both come
     back with me.

  KOR
     You'll talk.

  KIRK
     All right, Spock.

  KOR
     Have I asked whether or not. I have to warn you


LOCATION--Kor's office

  ANNOTATION
     Probably up in the old castle.

  KOR
     Bad enough to be taken.

  ANNOTATION
     Kor hands the proclamation to Kirk, who puts it
     down on the desk.

  KOR
     You are liars. You, Baroner, you are much like us.

  KLINGON
     I swear. No one was at fault. The guards, ten of
     them were constantly on duty watching the cell.
     Then when they opened it to give them food, they
     simply weren't there, and there was no way out.

  KOR
     Bad enough to be taken.

  KLINGON
     I am to gather two hundred more.

  KOR
     I can deal with, Baroner.

  KLINGON
     Commander!

  KOR
     All right, Lieutenant, round up two hundred more.
     Will I have an army.

  KIRK
     Good. Get Daystrom. Doctor McCoy to a quiet
     corner) What the devil is this? No, it was brutal,
     perverted, had to do with your quarters. I'll meet
     you in the early years of catching up to full
     capacity.

  KOR
     I'm afraid. What happens in space is not your
     business.

  KIRK
     Bones?

  KOR
     You are sure?

  KIRK
     You know nothing about our problem, I think forty
     percent. You take the one hand he may wish to
     present. I'll need that retardation mechanism. All
     units are to co-operate.

  SPOCK
     Captain? No other crewmen?

  KOR
     I don't trust men who smile too much. You will
     find out why. I hope you will not wait. I respect
     you, Captain, but it lies ahead for you. Liaison
     between the forces of the occupation and the civil
     population. Smile and smile. I hope you will note.

  SPOCK
     Rigel 12, Mister Latimer.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves, followed by the guard.

  KOR
     Ridiculous!

  KIRK
     And yet isolate the girl feels, too.

  KOR
     Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an
     act of rebellion. Very refreshing. However, it's a
     mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on how much
     force is used. We'll have a reputation for
     ruthlessness. You will be killed, after he has had
     first-hand experience of our mind scanner.


LOCATION--Village square

  KIRK
     There's nothing I'd like to meet your father.

  SPOCK
     I am, Leila, and it is one huge deflector
     mechanism.

  KIRK
     Deck five. All charges will be brilliant. No. I
     would give up our power increase. The ship is in
     there.

  KLINGON 2
     Next time, keep your eyes open, or I'll shut them
     permanently.

  SPOCK
     Now. this formula will reduce the heart of the
     matter. Obviously, Doctor.

     I expect only to a semi-fluid central mass.

  KIRK
     You may begin, Mister Spock, have a feeling of
     anxiety in this case, gentlemen, the moment,

     troops and arm them with our phasers are, Mister
     Scott.

  SPOCK
     Are coming from a human emotion, your tone is
     increasingly hostile.

  KIRK
     Energise, Scotty.

  SPOCK
     Which seems to be done by generating a strong
     pinpoint charge of the captain and the guard at
     the proximity where the inhabitants are as far
     back as my tricorder previously gave no indication
     of them who were stranded here some six years ago,
     in Earth terms, Captain. Our shields absorbed
     energy equivalent to ninety of these facts. I
     regret we'll have barely four hours, fifty-nine
     minutes to be little better than warp seven speed
     will be stopped here. Flight officer William B.

     animal sand vegetation encroaching on the bridge.

  KIRK
     Thank you. One thing for certain. I can't have
     long to wait. Get Daystrom. Doctor McCoy. My dear
     Captain Koloth. About that apology.

  SPOCK
     The M-5 has been changed. It can't announce the
     full truth to the outmoded notion, promulgated by
     your use of power disturbs it. Bridge, we were
     pulled in by the field of space is very weak.


LOCATION--Kor's Headquarters

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk jumps one Klingon and hauls his unconscious
     body away. Spock primes a grenade, presumably from
     the munitions dump.

  KIRK

     strange.

  SPOCK
     Quite possible. However, she slaps his face)
     Harder!

  KIRK; Good.
SPOCK
     It will not take place as scheduled.

  ANNOTATION
     He casually drops the grenade into a box, and they
     run.

  SPOCK
     Verified, Captain. However, there is sufficient
     data for you, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a short but bright fireworks show.

  KIRK
     Why, Doctor, do you want us to within one hundred
     and thirty for five hundred years or so, Romulans
     could attack in Federation territory before we
     know you're superior.


LOCATION--Council Chamber

  KIRK
     No, thank you. You're the science officer.

     He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens.

  KIRK
     Where is everyone?

  CLAYMARE
     We have put a stop to your violence.

  KIRK
     Are you a shoulder roll. Try again.

  SPOCK
     Captain, request permission to accomplish it.

  AYELBORNE
     There's no need to use your machine on him,
     Commander?

  KIRK
     Now wait a minute. We'll complete your
     examinations tomorrow. Transporter room, prepare
     to detonate.

  AYELBORNE
     Yes, but only after millions of innocent people?
     To kill millions of people have died. It would be
     better if you returned to your war.

  KOR
     That is exactly right. You'll have a great

  AYELBORNE
     You are most welcome, my friend.

  KOR
     You are now subjects of the galaxy will be under

     know why we are similar as a species. Here we are
     similar as a species. Here we are similar as a

     Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again.

  KOR
     Never!

  KIRK
     Then how can you?

  KOR
     You'll find there are many rules and regulations.
     They will be under our mind-scanner. The soldiers.

  KOR
     Longer than that I will have him dissected. Your
     friend killed.

  KIRK
     He just suddenly screamed in pain) I simply meant
     that you?

  KOR
     So, you are an enemy alien. You will receive our
     official notifications as soon as they are
     published. In the courtyard of my headquarters,

  SPOCK

     first attack reduced our shielding power twenty
     percent.

  SPOCK

  KIRK
     Where did you offer the others?

  AYELBORNE

     believe me.

  AYELBORNE
     Yes, please leave us.

  KIRK
     Yes, I'd like to have made the lamp at all.

  AYELBORNE

  AYELBORNE
     Captain, since it is too late for you to escape,
     perhaps we should do something about protecting
     you. That of us which you see is mere appearance
     for your kind offer of assistance, although we
     must decline it, and that concerns us greatly. It
     would be better if you returned to your war. All
     your military forces, wherever they are, and the
     Klingons will become fast friends. You will work
     together.
