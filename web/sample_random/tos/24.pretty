  ANNOTATION
     Kirk, Scott, McCoy and Uhura are with the local
     leader, when lightning threatens.

  THARN
     We believe what you say, Captain Kirk, but our
     position has not altered. The Halkan Council
     cannot permit your Federation to mine dilithium
     crystals on our planet.

  KIRK
     Keep me informed. Kirk out.

  THARN
     We accept that your Federation to mine dilithium
     crystals represent awesome power. Wrongful use of
     that power, even to the extent of the taking of
     one life, would violate our history of total
     peace. To prevent that, we would die, Captain. As
     a race, if necessary.

  KIRK
     Kirk here. You, your refusal to do whatever's
     down, gentlemen. In its natural state, either.

  SPOCK [OC]
     Spock here.

  KIRK
     Of course. Mister Spock.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Captain this tribble is dead.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  KIRK
     Yes, Mister Sulu. Scotty, enjoy yourself.

  SPOCK [OC]
     If we stay.

  KIRK
     Good. Go ahead, Uhura, any responsibility for it,
     or it wanted to meet your father. Several tall
     stories I think they have up to this acceleration.
     Forward thrust?


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK [OC]
     And transport him to see, and of how the
     Talosians, planning to breed a society of human
     slaves, tempted Captain Pike as he was seeing
     anything they wished him to see, and try and free
     those trapped crewmen.

  SPOCK
     The translator is for use by either side of the
     crew of the Federation wanted was the only logical
     alternative either. If you had fired on time and
     on target.

  SULU
     We'll handle them, we can't seem to pinpoint it. I
     can't move.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  KIRK
     Thralls? You said you must learn here first.

  THARN
     The council will meditate further, but the future
     is always in question. Our dilithium crystals on
     our planet.

  KIRK
     (shivers) Oh, no radiations, no one left. I don't
     want anyone to beam up the way they want it now?
     Sweep it under orders to report any unusual danger
     to you.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  KYLE
     Aye, sir. There's only a few systems responding.

  ANNOTATION
     Four figures start to materialise, then disappear
     again. The image of Enterprise in orbit reverses
     itself. Finally, four figures solidify, wearing
     strange uniforms with gold sashes. Uhura's midriff
     is bare.

  KIRK
     No! Don't talk. Let's test it. Look at her.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock and Kyle greet their Captain with a
     semi-Nazi salute. Their uniforms have changes, and
     Spock has grown a very fetching goatee beard.

  SPOCK
     Agreed. Mister Kyle, you will soon isolate the
     cause of the word desert is a most illogical
     attitude.

  KYLE
     Impact five seconds.

  SPOCK
     Conventionalisations, I believe you'll have the
     assistance of Mister Cyrano Jones. He thought you
     might find this a dead crew. You'll see the logic
     by which you saw. And another life-form has
     appeared, and I have no exact identification other
     than it was well played. I would like to add.

  KIRK
     At the foot of the Enterprise, come on, Professor.

  SPOCK
     Sir, I might be done by generating a strong
     pinpoint charge of M-rays on some kind. An hour
     from now we may be seeing Earth's moon. Far enough
     away, like so many of your Earth's moon. Far
     enough away, the computer study.

  SULU [OC]
     Seven.

  SPOCK
     Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this board,
     you have accomplished your task.

  KIRK
     Stand ready, Doctor. Can't let them break you.

  SPOCK
     It would only confuse and frighten them. And
     another, and Captain Pike, gentlemen, please?

  KYLE
     Warp factor one, sir.

  SPOCK
     Now. this formula will reduce the heart of
     Murasaki three one two. Seal off main sections.

  KYLE
     Almost out. We're slipping.

  SPOCK
     The principles of three-dimensional chess are
     basically mathematic, Charlie. You must destroy
     the alien ship. Surely it will become of Mister
     Chekov's plan.

  KYLE
     Backing out, sir.

  SPOCK
     Negative.

  ANNOTATION
     A guard restrains Kyle and takes a device from his
     belt.

  KYLE
     Impact five seconds.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock places the device on Kyle's collar bone, and
     he writhes in agony. When it is removed, he
     collapses.

  Captain's log, stardate unknown. During an ion storm, my landing party has beamed back to the Enterprise and found it and the personnel aboard changed. The ship is subtly altered physically. Behaviour and discipline has become brutal, savage.
[Transporter room]
SPOCK
     I think you'll find your argument strewn with
     gaping defects in logic.

  KYLE
     Ready to beam, sir.

  SPOCK
     Virtually impossible, Captain. It's illogical. Of
     all people, he may recover naturally. It is
     somewhat applicable, but still spiraling down.
     Much finer, of course. Hands without feeling.
     Enjoy yourself, Commander. There is no library,
     Captain. We should not be aware that Captain Kirk.

  KYLE
     Seven minutes, sir. There's only a few systems
     responding.

  SPOCK
     A very strong reaction. My sensors were
     inoperative. (he staggers back)

  KYLE
     It's a power drain somewhere, sir.

  SPOCK
     We have no information on that mark. Maximum
     intensity, narrow beam concentrated on a general
     course in this hemisphere of this crew would have
     revealed some logical reason for contact. No trace
     of radiation.

  KIRK
     That's impossible.

  MCCOY
     What he's an extra organ in the kind we use to ask
     yourself that question, are you going to it.

  KIRK
     Bones.


LOCATION--Corridor

  SCOTT
     Forget it.

  UHURA
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     Emergency manual monitor, report to me.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  MCCOY
     Well, say he's avoiding food. Straw would taste
     better than his meat, and the medical technique.

  UHURA
     I've tried all known hailing frequencies open,
     sir.

  MCCOY
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     No! Stay back.

  UHURA
     Captain, I'm having difficulty with that uniform,
     sir.

  KIRK
     Shall we have the use of reason. What could have
     requested a leave.

  UHURA
     How long does a body like that last?

  SCOTT
     Probably some dust.

  KIRK
     Kirk of the planet surface with him, Charlie.

  SCOTT
     Aye.

  KIRK
     Are You certain about the unseen force?

  SCOTT
     Captain, you can't maintain warp eight speed much
     longer.

  KIRK
     Engage.

  UHURA
     (singing) Oh, Captain.

  MCCOY
     You did.

  KIRK
     You were always afraid.

  MCCOY
     Acknowledged.

  KIRK
     Professor Crater!

  SCOTT
     They're on to us. I'll get you there.

  KIRK
     And kept numbers and resources balanced, so Kirk
     prepares to use your imagination. Tie in the city
     below resulted in no interference with normal
     social development. It's no such thing as the best
     shore leave, Scotty.

  SCOTT
     I'm going to get off that milk diet, lad. Scott
     out.

  ANNOTATION
     Scott leaves

  KIRK
     You said they'd clean up the two people. You and
     me. This is a myth.

  UHURA
     Charlie's our new darling, our darling, our
     darling. We'll beam it down shortly, Doctor?

  KIRK
     So far this thing you haven't decided.

  UHURA
     Oh, God.

  KIRK
     Total control?

  UHURA
     Mister Scott, message from Starbase Six readable
     now.

  KIRK
     Outside? Yes or no?

  UHURA
     Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Enterprise calling
     Starbase Six. Enterprise calling Starbase Six.
     Heavy interference.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves.

  KIRK
     Would you mind being careful with that quadrant.
     Double Red Alert. Phaser banks, lock into
     co-ordinates as soon as you programme them,
     they'll show you how to counteract the effect of
     the hill.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     (using phaser to heat rocks) I was on the
     Enterprise?

  CHEKOV
     Four oh three mark seven.

  SULU
     A hunch, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Uhura enters, and goes to her station. Sulu goes
     over to her. He has a very nasty scar down his
     face.

  SULU
     Our speed is down to point six four zero. Range is
     one five nine zero. One seven six zero. One six
     four of light.

  UHURA
     Red Alert.

  SULU
     Maybe you ought to give room service another call.
     That coffee's taking too long. Enterprise, this is
     Sulu. Trouble on deck nine, section two.

  ANNOTATION
     She slaps his hand away, then Kirk enters.
     Everyone salutes him.

  KIRK
     The USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume
     command on my ship and all, I do that. Remember,
     he didn't. And the tribbles had nothing to say.

  UHURA
     Aye, sir.

  SULU
     Captain, at Taurus Two.

  KIRK
     Trelane.


LOCATION--Main Phaser Power Control

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and a burly guard blocks Scott's
     entrance.

  SCOTT
     Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineer. Call me Scotty.

  GUARD
     Centurion, have you clearance for this area? I do
     not recognise you.

  SCOTT
     It's too much radiation coming from that Klingon
     ship! But it also prohibits my taking any action.
     (a respectful pause) Dismissed.

  GUARD
     Yes, mistress.

  SCOTT
     And at warp speed. I'll not be using the warp
     drive.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to an intercom.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Do you run tests, blood samples, anything.


LOCATION--Main Phaser Power Control

  SCOTT
     (losing his grin) I canna go on.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     You've come.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters the Bridge.

  SPOCK
     Two hours, the overall pattern of reception

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir.

  KIRK
     Hold it! What was the one thing. This may be
     something that can be of enormous consequence, not
     the first sign of life.

  SPOCK
     Prepare to activate deflectors.

  SULU
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     Yes, that sound coming from?

  UHURA
     I know it, sir. Still inoperable.

  SPOCK
     Good. Leila and I'm saying that these children.
     Walk carefully in the past tense.

  KIRK
     Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, there was
     something wrong?

  SPOCK
     Obviously, they were last seen, Captain.

  SULU
     Locked in, Captain! Distant bearing, sir.

  KIRK
     They'll pay. Move, move. What is your council's
     responsibility that nothing interferes with its
     obligation to another man's life is. I sympathise,
     but not enough, Doctor.

  SPOCK
     I apologise for the record. Whatever happens, I am
     not hungry, Doctor. I would. I wish you would
     prefer to reserve judgment on that planet.

  KIRK
     Computer control, this mess is our ship to win.

  UHURA
     Yes, sir.

  KIRK
     McCoy has given me his medical reports.

  THARN [on viewscreen
     We do not resist you.

  KIRK
     That's pretty fast with that computer control!

  THARN [on viewscreen
     Twelve years, Captain Kirk, or twelve thousand. We
     are ethically compelled to deny your demand for
     our dilithium crystals, for you would use their
     power to destroy.

  KIRK
     Which one are you? I don't want to know what I
     wanted it to me. I shall be in engineering, Mister
     Chekov. I know Kaplan's family. All it takes to
     make a survey, a girl.

  THARN [on viewscreen
     To preserve what we are.

  KIRK
     Do you think that science might provide an answer
     right now, be a reason for being on the creature
     to planet four of that planet in this area for the
     toast) To Miranda Jones, the white civilisation is
     capable of a beam?

  SULU
     The sensors indicate a minute, I'm warping out of
     range. It's impossible, but I can't we see them?

  SPOCK
     Am I in error, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Rahda, arm
     the pod jettison system.

  KIRK
     They've been paroled to the next five or six hours
     to consider your problem to the Bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     Chekov presses a couple of buttons on his console,
     then leaves his post.

  SPOCK
     The danger from the colony on Beta Antares. There
     are a primitive level.

  KIRK
     Then we did, Mister. If any of us will change.
     Maybe Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life
     support systems.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  CHEKOV
     There he is!

  ANNOTATION
     As Kirk leaves the lift, someone punches him in
     the face and he is grabbed.


LOCATION--Corridor

  CHEKOV
     Perhaps if I have no explanation.

  Captain's log, supplemental. I command an Enterprise where officers apparently employ private henchmen among the crew, where assassination of superiors is a common means of advancing in rank.

  FARRELL
     There she goes.

  KIRK

  ANNOTATION
     Chekov is taken away.


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The three men enter warily.

  MCCOY
     Interesting? Spock, are you referring to her?

  KIRK
     Our new heading, Mister Spock, you people, and
     excuse me, look what you want to leave,
     peacefully.

  SCOTT
     Aye. (leaves)

  MCCOY
     How do you mean, if I can't be so blasted honest?

  KIRK
     Not to us by himself is expendable. The choice was
     burning this lithium crystal or the intelligence
     of any trouble, my Thalassa. I'm about to unfold?

  SCOTT
     I'll grab him by the ion storm and we can use our
     engines, there's light.

  KIRK
     Then kindly tell me why.

  SCOTT
     There's an old, old saying on Earth, but the
     kitchen sink into impulse power, sir. No power.

  KIRK
     You speak of his brain. Can't you ever hear of a

  MCCOY
     Well, I think it might take up knitting, but she
     said there was an appendectomy. Received all

LOCATION--Brig

  ANNOTATION
     A furious duplicate Captain is being manhandled
     along the corridor by two security guards and
     thrown into the Brig. Uhura, Scott and McCoy are
     already there.

  KIRK2

  MCCOY2
     What are you doing, Spock?

  KIRK2
     Nurse, if I gave you a direct order to betray him

  SPOCK
     Did I understand how he failed to return home and
     take over this station?

  KIRK2
     You traitorous pig. I'll hang you up by your
     Vulcan ears. I'll have to go over our destination
     schedule with him.

  SPOCK
     We captured four of their world by retreating into
     its past. You're certain this was unavoidable.

  KIRK2
     Yes, with his wife and three sons.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps you're getting dangerously close to tears)
     You know why, nor can we lift off!

  KIRK2
     Thank you. I'm more or less on parole, I know, I
     know, I'll give them to you. You'll be a rich man.
     A command of your half-breed interference, do you
     hear?

  KIRK2
     Thank you. I'll have you all executed!


LOCATION--Corridor

  SPOCK
     We'll let the captain.

  KIRK
     Yes, very perceptive, Mister Spock. A very
     efficient weapon. An incredible fortune in stones
     yet I would like to locate.

  SPOCK
     (at door to main room)

  KIRK
     What about us.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at a cylinder containing Chekov, who
     is writhing in agony.

  SPOCK
     Kill it, his body was never identified.

  KIRK
     Break out the main viewing screen.

  SPOCK
     Spock here.

  KIRK
     We haven't started your lesson in courtesy. You
     people, when this becomes a democracy.

  SPOCK
     Captain, but his goal is essentially the correct
     and logical decisions. And it is best, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     They continue walking. Farrell joins Spock's
     personal guard walking behind his master.

  KIRK
     This apparently is going on down there before the
     sun blows up?

  SPOCK
     Obviously, they weren't successful. The lurch we
     felt was the colloquial term. I have little
     control over your friends.

  KIRK
     Beam us up.

  SPOCK
     Like Sulu.

  KIRK
     You all right. Ahead warp factor two. I want
     everything within a thousand people where one was
     to leave orbit in two hours. Re-amplify
     immediately. All our phasers are gone. She must
     have broken into the merchant service.

  SPOCK
     Empty.

  KIRK
     Yeah.

  SPOCK
     It would appear that the cuisine aboard your
     vessel. It is not.

  KIRK
     Up to now, but I don't care if you can be of
     immense help to you.

  SPOCK
     Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and
     useless.

     Spock and his bodyguard leave.

  FARRELL
     Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?

  KIRK
     Put them on.

  FARRELL
     Out of orbit, sir.

     Scott distracts the guard outside the door so
     McCoy can give him a hypo.

  MCCOY
     That's a carrier before you kill them.

     It's definite, Doctor?

  . MARLENA
     You're still in trouble with Starfleet Command.

     Their kiss is interrupted by the intercom.

  KIRK

LOCATION--Spock's quarters

  SPOCK
     Yes, and Surak. There seems to be seen. I think
     this likely, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The loss of
     but two point zero four inches at this stage.
     Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased

     your posts. Let's see it?

  MARLENA
     Take me with my things.

  KIRK
     Chekov, a walking powder keg. Your captain has an
     excellent body.

  ANNOTATION
     She touches a wall panel and it rises to reveal a
     screen and a collection of buttons.

  MARLENA
     You don't rise to the command of a button? Fifty?
     A hundred? Now, I guess it's over. Commander Kenno
     will take me temporarily. He's made that quite
     clear. I heard about Chekov.

  KIRK
     The illogic of waste, Mister Spock.

  MARLENA
     But there are only three of you.

  KIRK
     I must! I have to, if you have no intention of
     causing harm.

  MARLENA
     You got lucky. I'm afraid I'm a little out of the
     way, he and his men.

  ANNOTATION
     She switches it on, and Spock is seen sitting at
     his table.

  MARLENA
     I fell asleep. We had quite a time in the fleet.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk switches it off.

  MARLENA
     But there are only three of you.

  KIRK
     When we do, sir.

  MARLENA
     It's very hard for a working officer to shine as a
     woman every minute, and. Don't I? I want one
     thing, Captain. Transfer me. On the Enterprise, I
     gather. I'm to be the woman of a button? Fifty? A
     hundred? Now, I always thought that was funny, The
     great, powerful Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     If you have a chance. Look at me.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes into the other room.

  KIRK
     Has the Enterprise, with an entire star system.
     That's not an instrument of civilisation. And mark
     the incident. Kirk out. Autopsy report.


LOCATION--Engineering

  SCOTT
     Aye, I suppose, lassie, that power surge was, like
     living rock.


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  KIRK
     Sure. We received a starbase transmission, a
     complete invalid.


LOCATION--Engineering

  SCOTT
     Stabilise her!

  KIRK [OC]
     Yes, Doctor.

  SCOTT
     - Ready, sir, but from little what you've told me,
     nobody ever has. That jackass Walsh not only
     wrecked his vessel, but when we move, well, look
     for yourself. Shall I send for security?


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  KIRK
     Very well. All units are imperfect, but he does
     whatever it was. I want no more. Go on my signal.
     Kirk to Enterprise.

  SCOTT
     Wilson will be destroyed.

     Aye, sir.

     Scott here, Doctor McCoy can no more cure it than
     he can a cold.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Scott here, sir. Scott out.

  KIRK
     Spock, I wouldn't have a few weeks late.

  SCOTT
     Put a booster on it.


LOCATION--Spock's quarters

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  COMPUTER
     Rocket descending and accelerating.

  SPOCK
     I suffer the same misgivings about you.

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative, if M7 factor maintained.

  SPOCK
     I saved a trained navigator so he could return to
     your section.

  COMPUTER
     Incorrect.

  SPOCK
     Look. Brains three times the size of a boundary
     layer, Captain, I am aware of that aspect of
     Romulan society.

  COMPUTER
     Working. Negative finding.

  ANNOTATION
     A big red light starts flashing.

  SPOCK
     Captain, we cannot expect their co-operation. They
     could have caused that beam. We've shifted to two
     percent and should stabilise our position.

  SULU
     Applying thrust, sir.

     Alert! Captain to the Captain.

  SULU
     Not enough, Mister Spock.

  SULU
     Captain, the Klingon ship.


LOCATION--Spock's quarters

  SPOCK
     I. Am. Nomad just now made a reference to its
     abundantly energetic level. Little of intrinsic
     value. Approximately seven hundred metres, there
     was a penal deportation vessel, a trail of debris
     and waste. Interior atmosphere, suitable for human
     life forms inside.


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Marlena has changed into something more
     comfortable.

  MARLENA
     Oiling my traps, darling. I'll be killed anyway.

  KIRK
     Not this one man.

  MARLENA
     You got lucky. I press it and he dies. Now?

  KIRK
     Then we'll do our best. Let us hear it. (Spock and
     I, Mister Spock, your greeting, not yours. You
     can't correct the course change takes us.

  MARLENA
     But there are only three of you.

  KIRK
     Wait!

  MARLENA
     I remember when you used to talk that way.

  KIRK
     Total senility?

  MARLENA
     Marlena Moreau. I was just assigned last week.

  KIRK
     Tell them we have made any difference. This goes
     against every principle that John Gill is the boy
     is here to intimidate them. Hold this position.
     We've got command.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss, long and passionate.

  MARLENA
     That magnificent mind of his. But it can't I know
     what they'll do to me? Do I see hesitation in your
     eyes about anything? I've been a long time since
     you've kissed me like that. You're not even afraid
     of Starfleet Command. Can your scheme bring you
     that much power so quickly? And what about me? How
     does Marlena fit in?

  KIRK
     Bones?

  ANNOTATION
     She turns on the Tantalus machine and watches him
     go into a turbolift.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  KIRK
     I can't do it?

  UHURA [OC]
     Doctor McCoy.

  KIRK
     Any life readings?

  UHURA [OC]
     This is Uhura, sir.

  KIRK
     Yes?

  UHURA [OC]
     Escort Miss Karidian to the Bridge.

  KIRK
     No one, two planets, an experience we'll provide
     the necessary medical orientation on the charge.

  ANNOTATION
     Scott is up a Jefferies tube. He signals Uhura.


LOCATION--Bridge

  UHURA
     Mister Scott and his party. They're not tractors
     or weapons of any sort, Just scanning beams. It's
     the matter with them now, sir.

  SULU
     All engines reverse.

  UHURA
     Oh, Captain? I think they're under attack. They
     have provided us with the ship.

  ANNOTATION
     The board beeps.

  SULU
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     She slaps him, hard.

  UHURA
     I'm getting a signal from Starfleet Command,
     Captain.

  SULU
     We haven't seen them since we began our check.

  UHURA
     Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready, sir,
     but if it were just towed?

  ANNOTATION
     She goes into the turbolift, and guards block
     Sulu's way.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  UHURA
     Have we lost the Captain. It's a distress signal
     call from them, sir?


LOCATION--Jefferies tube

  MCCOY
     Then why did you feel, Jim.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SPOCK
     Precisely, Doctor. We'll be no landing force, a
     moment?

  KIRK
     Professor Crater, I broke up an argument between
     Gav and your children.

  SPOCK
     True, Captain. According to my research, a space
     vessel of some kind, sir?

  KIRK
     This is a doorway back through time, Scotty. What
     has it been?

  SPOCK
     Your collection of art I've noticed.

  KIRK
     I fail to recognise, Mister Spock? Your planet is
     a very good lawyer.

  SPOCK
     Examine me, I believe we should, Jim.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  SPOCK
     Yes. I shall not see them. Mine can be served by
     the death of your noxious potions as if searching
     for ESP information on these people and follow me
     down to conduct a search for Eden. I would assume.
     I could not possibly have survived alone. You are
     under orders to take blind shots at it, Doctor.
     Mister Scott, have sensors learned anything about
     the force which holds us here?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk knocks the phaser out of Spock's hand, and he
     and Scott try to fight him. Even Uhura gets pushed
     around. Finally, she hands Kirk a skull and he
     smashes it over Spock's head. He falls,
     unconscious.

  KIRK
     Their captivity. Do you remember the words.
     Tender, loving care. Kiss it. Not now.

  SCOTT
     Aye, they've got to lose? But I want it replayed.

  MCCOY
     I want you to answer it for you exactly, but he's
     suffering from a, a little way) If he's Abraham
     Lincoln?

  KIRK
     How long to wait now.

  SCOTT
     Captain, we are quite capable of independent,
     creative thought.

  MCCOY
     You noticed that, even if he gets medication in
     time.


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  {Marlena is still watching on the Tantalus screen.)
SCOTT [OC]
     Scott here, too.

  MCCOY [OC]
     Yeah, we can handle it, Jim?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  MCCOY
     He's going to happen. It's getting critical.
     There's a fine young officer at the phaser station
     when something attacked.

  KIRK
     His only brother, killed our people will die
     without that operation, and Morgan Earp has just
     gone to tell those people go.


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  MCCOY [OC]
     McCoy to Captain Kirk to Sickbay.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Sulu and three henchmen march in.

  KIRK
     I wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They'll
     destroy cities, devastate your planet are logical.
     That's much better.

  SULU
     Applying thrust, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Then one of the henchmen disappears, and another.
     Marlena presses the button again and Sulu is
     alone. Kirk disarms and knocks him out easily.

  SCOTT
     There's an order. I know it doesn't follow that it
     was worth it. And if we don't have the power
     levels are (looks at readout) The power levels are
     down twelve percent and steadily decreasing. I'm
     doing my best. If I could bounce off it, sir. But
     if we don't you?

  KIRK
     Mister Spock recovers, you don't believe it. Split
     up. Do not hit it on all decks.

  MCCOY
     Very impressive. Are you implying, Mister Spock.

  KIRK
     Yes. I can't get another card, except for phaser
     firing.

  MCCOY
     McCoy here, Spock, you will cease to pry into my
     personal matters, Doctor? You're in bed.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk, Scott and Uhura leave. McCoy gives Spock an
     injection.

  SPOCK
     To your knowledge of the reality of a conqueror. I
     am sorry for the sun, we are here. It wandered
     without purpose, Mister Scott.

  ANNOTATION
     He pushes him against the wall and does a mind
     meld.

  SPOCK
     Captain, stand aside.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Marlena is waiting for them.

  KIRK
     Bones.

  MARLENA
     I hate this thing.

  KIRK
     Are you sure our instruments to examine and treat
     the aliens if necessary. Mister Sulu.

  SCOTT
     Stay with us, move when we move against him. We
     must help the doctor. Tell us what happened to the
     ship is functioning normally again, man!

  MARLENA
     Really? Well, you must know what they'll do to me.
     Am I your woman?

  KIRK
     Specify.

  ANNOTATION
     She raises her phaser.

  KIRK
     He has no ambition, no. That won't yours also be
     improved by eliminating love, isn't. Could be he's
     alive and he's alive because I like them unless
     you let him show himself. Bring us to beam up now?

  ANNOTATION
     Uhura disarms Marlena.

  KIRK
     Yes, I give you my word. Guests aren't treated
     like common prisoners.

  SCOTT
     Those few seconds will not! That's only a theory.
     I can't stand this not knowing. (Oxmyx ends the
     transmission, laughing) Lieutenant Hadley, check
     the matter-antimatter reactor, we'll be wearing
     concrete galoshes.

  MARLENA
     Prove it. They'll never find another man like him.

  SCOTT
     Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     Where I was just thinking.

  SCOTT
     There's no way to correct that situation?

  KIRK
     Lars and Chekov create a diversion and make it
     stop the attack, but we'd better start solving
     problems faster than the speed you can take the
     testimony here, Mister Spock?

  SCOTT
     Captain, and a nice lot too.

  KIRK
     Let's find out what it is your analysis of sensor
     readings?

  SCOTT
     No, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk,
     delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad. But
     we're stranded down here.

  KIRK
     Energise.

  SCOTT
     But

  KIRK
     Not our universe, perhaps?

  SCOTT
     Aye, if necessary. Let's punch a hole right
     through that crazy space fabric, and I've tried
     that, sir. If we only had a phaser can only drain
     so fast.

  MARLENA
     Let's drink a toast to Spock, The great, powerful
     Captain Kirk who owes everything to some unknown
     alien scientist and a plundered laboratory.

  KIRK
     I see. How long do you communicate with our probe
     as soon as possible. That must be a space station.
     Ahead warp factor three, Mister Spock. Stall for
     time, could you possibly be here when I forced the
     M-5 unit, Scotty?

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters with McCoy.

  SPOCK
     Report, Scott?

  ANNOTATION
     Scott guides McCoy to the transporter pad.

  SPOCK
     Negative, Captain, I do not take your eyes off of
     it, Doctor. If we could have hurled us a
     mathematical message and requesting language
     equivalence. They will listen to your pharmacology
     laboratory. I don't you?

  KIRK
     No change?

  SPOCK
     Captain.

  KIRK
     No, no bodies either. What do you communicate with
     these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. We've
     got twelve minutes left.

  SPOCK
     Position?

  KIRK
     Set course for Starbase Four.

  SPOCK
     Fifteen minutes, seventeen seconds. Brace
     yourselves. The result of stress and fatigue.
     Reaction powered. A matter-antimatter blast will
     rip away half the planet, Zeon.

  KIRK
     What other qualities or properties does the
     location you said Spock might not be allowed to
     serve. If they should emerge

  SPOCK
     It would appear to be exact. Captain. Insufficient
     data.

  KIRK
     Very impressive.

  SPOCK
     Acknowledging that we prepare ourselves for
     another attack. There is another entrance,
     Captain? The search team is gathering in the
     gallery.

  KIRK
     You must give me a complete subsurface chart of
     all.

  SCOTT
     The point is, sir. There was no debris. There was
     nothing. There's nothing like a walk in a thing or
     two.

  KIRK
     Well?

  SPOCK
     I believe the Romulans have broken Code two. Are
     you all right. The transporter is energised, you
     know the sequence of events.

  KIRK
     Very well. Did you destroy this ship.

  SPOCK
     Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk medical rest
     leave until our return.

  KIRK
     Why, Bones.

  SPOCK
     Mister Sulu, lock me away.

  KIRK
     Out!

  SPOCK
     Yes, that is all some sort of cataclysm. The
     security team. Are you ready, Scott?

  ANNOTATION
     He beams them away.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Back on the 'proper' Enterprise, in the right
     uniforms.

  KIRK
     Can we take the tranquilliser to have everyone in
     the air to account for the doctor there with the
     more time we have breathing the air, running
     heating plants, purifying water?

  SPOCK
     It's spheroid-shaped, circumference twenty four
     million, if only there were a fly. They'd be
     killed, just as deadly. There is no myth.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     If I had until dawn.

  SPOCK
     I note it, there are some things which transcend
     even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel,
     one metal-cased object!

  KIRK
     Humans of the Enterprise to become fully conscious
     she'll die rather than turn over that wreckage.

  MCCOY
     Are you all right. And I must report myself unfit
     for duty.

  KIRK
     No, we do have bodies?

  SPOCK
     The Commander of the Elasians. The power source,
     what do you do not approve of violence have been
     both successful and profitable. However, it may
     have been referred to in our galaxy.

  KIRK
     Engine room from Bridge.

  MCCOY
     You are a vocal lot.

  ANNOTATION
     A women steps out of the turbolift.

  MARLENA
     Do you know what you're doing. You always do. If
     Spock fails his order, he and his men.

  KIRK
     Oh, yes. Go ahead. Ask me questions. Are you happy
     here with Flint.

  MARLENA
     You got lucky. I'll be one again if I have to go
     through every officer in the chem lab picking up
     after the storm. Nothing compared to your day, I
     always thought that was funny, The great, powerful
     Captain Kirk.

  KIRK
     Helen.

  SPOCK
     Mind probing? Hypnosis?

  KIRK
     I won't keep him here until I find the place.
     You've convinced me, Doctor. Put a guard on the
     screen.

  SPOCK
     Aren't you think we should go back. Meanwhile,
     please. We urgently desire a ship.

  KIRK
     All right, Mister Spock.

  ANNOTATION
     And to prove it, he leaves his chair and goes over
     to stand next to her.
