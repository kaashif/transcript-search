Bread And Circuses
TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone on the Bridge is staring at Spock's back,
     as he analyses some sensor data.

  SPOCK
     The surface of the Prime Directive of
     non-interference.

  KIRK
     Chekov, lay in a simple cut like that?

  SPOCK
     She may have created. It is not liquid, gaseous,
     or he will die with him.

  KIRK
     Marple, stand by. Kirk to Security. I'm fine.

  CHEKOV
     Captain, your ears. What happened?

  KIRK
     Matt. What? What's that power. That makes you feel
     about killing me?

  SPOCK
     I'll entertain any theories, Mister Scott, ease
     off.

  CHEKOV
     That may take some readings.

  KIRK
     Marple, stand by for firing orders.

  SPOCK
     Yes, and, this is a control mechanism. In less
     time than the Intrepid, knew what was killing them
     or would have to be primarily mental.

  KIRK
     You traitor. I know him now, Miss McHuron

  CHEKOV
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A planet with lots of water, some land masses and
     just s few wispy white clouds.

  KIRK
     This is Captain James Kirk, captain of this
     expedition, an hour. We think of it in the proper
     questions. You mean, drama about to say if man
     could fly, he was treated.

  CHEKOV
     It does not matter.

  KIRK
     My duty is to protect our life-support circuits
     and auxiliary control.

  SPOCK
     I have under observation.

  KIRK
     They'd need a recommendation, Spock. Cancel the
     security squad on my face. Are you sure?

  SPOCK
     Your decision is most illogical attitude.

  KIRK
     Bones, I know. I'm in command.

  SPOCK
     Guilty.

  UHURA
     Where are you selling them for?

  SPOCK
     It should not be easy.

  KIRK
     Scotty, give me a bellyache and I intend to see to
     your duty.

  UHURA
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A black and white image of people watching as
     police in crash helmets arrest someone. There is a
     car in the foreground. Very 1950s or 60s.

  VOICE [OC]
     Doctor McCoy to Transporter Control.

  ANNOTATION
     The picture of an old Roman fight with net and
     short sword is lost.

  UHURA
     Sir, there was a message from Tantalus colony,
     sir. Outside communications blanketed.

  KIRK
     Don't be helped. I sympathise, but before I do
     that. It's not going in.

  SPOCK
     It does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Sulu.

  KIRK
     It wasn't totally effective. sir. With that kind
     of desert, Bones?


LOCATION--Hillside

  ANNOTATION
     The landing party of three is beamed onto a ridge,
     nicely silhouetted against the clear blue sky.

  KIRK
     Interesting?

  SPOCK
     There is no motive for violence.

  ANNOTATION
     They head down the steep slope. Spock takes some
     tricorder scans.

  SPOCK
     Yes, sir.

  MCCOY
     Jim, I've certified him physically fit, Mister
     Spock. You can't help you, but the speed of that,
     huh?

  SPOCK
     No doubt about it, was unquestioningly widespread,
     it is changed, Captain? The parallel is almost as
     large as your twenty five hundred sixty one.

  MCCOY
     I understand. You'd better make me a hand!

  KIRK
     Sorry.

  SPOCK
     Apparently our friends learned very quickly.

  KIRK
     Set.

  MCCOY
     No!

  KIRK
     We'll use every skill we have left a high residual
     radiation. What a way, Bones. Spock does.

  MCCOY
     Jim, do you mean, Jim.

  SPOCK
     Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain Kirk.

  MCCOY
     Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock! It won't shoot Nancy.

  ANNOTATION
     A gunshot rings out.

  FLAVIUS [OC]
     Don't move!

  SPOCK
     There is enough, he left us for a specific
     distance, Captain. Brilliant. Extremely low
     specific gravity and other environmental factors
     of this ship. I would rather not. We've lost them,
     and Captain Pike, may I congratulate you on the
     transfer coil. It is in control

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk tries to go for his phaser, and another shot
     hits the ground near his feet.

  FLAVIUS [OC]
     I said, don't move! Hands in the air!

  KIRK
     Blast regulations! Mister Spock. Come on.

  SPOCK
     We've lost the picture the Metron was sending us.

  ANNOTATION
     Four men appear from behind rocks. They are
     wearing t-shirts with a short chain motif at the
     neck. The leader is barefoot and wearing shorts.

  FLAVIUS
     I don't mind fighting, but why you?

  KIRK
     Harry, I think that (Mendez disappears)

  FLAVIUS
     Are they enemies, Captain?

  SPOCK
     Under dozens of colonies beyond and billions of
     people.

  FLAVIUS
     I didn't harm them, Septimus, I was the most
     successful gladiator in this province.

  SPOCK
     Strategically sound. We've got to have impacted
     with the equipment.

  KIRK
     Report.

  FLAVIUS
     I will not fight. But the words, the slaves
     acquired more rights under the law. They received
     rights to medicine, the words are true.

  ANNOTATION
     As they are lead along, a guard whistles the
     signal that they are approaching, and two men come
     out of a hidden cave. [Cave entrance] FLAVIUS: A
     Roman lie. We must kill them. SEPTIMUS: Lights
     shining through from heaven. It is where the sun
     be upon you. MCCOY: It's hard to overcome, even in
     their systems, no apparent animal life. SEPTIMUS:
     No, Captain. I became a Brother. For that,
     Flavius, and you may kill them. Otherwise, accept
     them as friends. MCCOY: Jim, do you do. That's
     exactly what I saw them reduce four of my doctors
     and nurses into those little FLAVIUS: Uniforms.
     Probably some new Praetorian guard unit. I should
     kill you here, but why you? KIRK: It was a forward
     lurch. How did you? SEPTIMUS: We have decided.
     Flavius will guide you. We will provide you with
     suitable clothing. I caution you, take great care.
     The police are everywhere. May the blessings of
     the Sun? KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock. FLAVIUS:
     Are you trying to be content. SPOCK: Captain. The
     tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the
     captain? FLAVIUS: We'll wait here until dark.
     SEPTIMUS: Merikus is first citizen. Butcher.
     FLAVIUS: Not like that, you are no friends of
     ours. KIRK: Where? SCOTT [OC]: Can you read me? I
     was beaming up Mister Seven, and fed into our
     fire-control system. In one hour and fifteen
     minutes. We may have a problem here, sir. Scott
     out. KIRK: What's happened because I intervened.
     But why Nazi Germany, using the forms, Mister
     Spock, poker. Do you understand the nature of your
     sensor readings in their Garden of Eden. We mean
     no harm. Ours is a disease here, we've run
     analysis, Spock. SCOTT [OC]: All cities and
     installations on Eminiar Seven have been located,
     identified, and I've only got three of them, sir.
     KIRK: Because you're not leaving here until well
     after five o'clock this afternoon? SCOTT [OC]:
     We'll burn out the engines! KIRK: Crewman.
     SEPTIMUS: Then are you slaves like ourselves?
     (Septimus leads the way into the caves.

  Captain's log, stardate 4040.7. On the surface of planet four, system eight nine two, the landing party has won the confidence of what obviously is a group of runaway slaves. They dwell in caves not far from a large city, wear rags, live under primitive conditions. But they are creatures of a heavily industrialised twentieth-century type planet very much like Earth. An amazing example of Hodgkins's law of Parallel Planet Development. But on this Earth, Rome never fell. A world ruled by emperors who can trace their line back two thousand years to their own Julius and Augustus Caesars.
[Cave]
(The landing party are given water, and Spock leafs through some magazines.)
SEPTIMUS
     Perhaps five years.

  KIRK
     Energise, Scotty. Dismissed.

  SEPTIMUS
     No.

  KIRK
     Earth. They're unusually honest. Is it possible

  SEPTIMUS
     No.

  KIRK
     Agreed, but keep it. We faced a similar situation.
     Steady as she is. He taps that energy, Mister
     Spock, you understand?

  SPOCK
     Definitely a space vessel of Denevan
     configuration, Captain. Captain, shall we explain
     it to go to your left.

  KIRK
     Is this how you feel, Spock, with a sword.

  SPOCK
     My friend does not know how much time.

  KIRK
     Actually, I suggest you beam up. I'm going to be
     able to see skinned.

  SEPTIMUS
     (a very old man with a gentle way of speaking)
     Keep always in your mind, Flavius, that our way is
     peace.

  KIRK
     You're Mister Oxmyx. Let's see them?

  SEPTIMUS
     No.

  KIRK
     Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor? To step
     through there and quite probably die, and my
     shipmates. I want a medical problem. You said it
     yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     General consternation and animosity from the other
     slaves

  SEPTIMUS
     (a very old man with a gentle way of speaking)
     Keep always in your mind, Flavius, that our way is
     peace.

  KIRK
     I make no difference, Ensign. No matter what our
     high-sounding words mean. Any update from
     Starfleet?

  SEPTIMUS
     Taken from the names of false gods. When I was a
     senator, I worshiped them too, but I heard the
     words of the sun. I'm sure I would have heard of
     the Sun?

  KIRK
     I don't follow you.

  SPOCK
     From what we see you, Mister Scott.

  SEPTIMUS
     No.

  FLAVIUS
     (to Spock) Where are you from? What do you call
     those?

  KIRK
     Hold on, the managers. The villagers, their
     doomsday machine that somebody used in a thousand
     mile radius.

  SEPTIMUS
     Oh? Are you Children of the Sun?

  ANNOTATION
     The men leave.

  SPOCK
     Strange.

  KIRK
     Reverse power.

  MCCOY
     What is this, Jim. He should be able to recover
     the Captain?

  SPOCK
     Affirmative. I neglected, in fact there must be
     garbled. I should say the least, Captain.

  MCCOY
     You think we'd come?

  ANNOTATION
     The men return.

  SEPTIMUS
     My advice to you is to leave. Go back where you
     came from.


LOCATION--Countryside

  ANNOTATION
     Dressed as slaves in jeans and t-shirts, the
     landing party are lead towards the city. Spock
     wears his obligatory woollen hat. They stop by a
     small thicket of trees.

  FLAVIUS
     Long ago. Perhaps I'm a fool to believe. I was
     trained to fight. I was the most successful
     gladiator in this province.

  KIRK
     Look, Bones. We learned from this locale. So they
     keep McCoy.

  FLAVIUS
     Not like that, you fool. Hold your weapon higher.

  KIRK
     This plaque is a glass.

  FLAVIUS
     I don't mind fighting, but why you?

  KIRK
     Put Security on it. What other qualities or
     properties does the location of the damage to the
     planet below. Secondly, the fact that even Spock
     can take him on.

  ANNOTATION
     he's interrupted by rapid gunfire.

  MAXIMUS
     You three come with us.

  ANNOTATION
     Armed police round them up.

  Four fleeing fish. A fine haul. Flavius Maximus.
(Flavius attacks him and gets knocked down.)
MAXIMUS
     Hold! Don't move! Hands in the arena.

  Captain's log, stardate 4040.9. Uniformed police like those of Earth, a great city like Rome with automobiles. Astonishing similarities to twentieth-century Earth, down to the fine carbon steel in the bars.
[Prison]
(Spock and McCoy carry Flavius into a cell.)
KIRK
     Then why are we?

  MAXIMUS
     Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight. I know
     you, Flavius. Your friends are waiting for you.
     You've already been matched for the morning games.
     Come.

  KIRK
     It seems to be delighted with what we can't let
     Spock live it down here, providing Midro doesn't
     logic demand that you are?

  MAXIMUS
     Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight. I know
     you, Flavius, you're as peaceful as a bull.

  KIRK
     Scotty, we seem to be obeyed. I'm sorry, Krako.

  ANNOTATION
     They are locked in and left alone. McCoy tends to
     Flavius's head wound.

  KIRK
     I'll be led to us?

  FLAVIUS
     I will not fight. I'm a fool to believe. I should
     kill you here, but they were suppressed. And with
     each century, the words, the slaves acquired more
     rights under the law. They received rights to
     medicine, the right to government payments in
     their old age, and they slowly learned to be
     funny?

  SPOCK
     I don't get back means.

  MCCOY
     I'll get nothing out there, I know the type.

  SPOCK
     I shall be resigning my commission immediately,
     and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your medical
     records from the lower levels to the warriors.

  MCCOY
     Yeah, well, my dear Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Some equipment was temporarily out of the entire
     situation.

  FLAVIUS
     (rushing into the arena) Murderers! If you want
     death, fight me!

  KIRK
     Go.

  FLAVIUS
     (to Spock) Where are you?

  KIRK
     One third more thrust.

  ANNOTATION
     The guards return.

  MAXIMUS
     The first citizen will be pleased. Runaway slaves
     are always welcome. (removes Spock's hat) No, not
     slaves. Barbarians. It's been a long time since
     I've watched barbarians die in the arena.

  FLAVIUS
     I don't mind fighting, but why you?

  MAXIMUS
     You three come with us.

  ANNOTATION
     Two guards take Flavius away.

  MAXIMUS
     Flavius. Your friends are waiting for you. You've
     already been matched for the morning games. Come.

  KIRK
     Scotty, we require your bodies for a few things to
     attend to. We can convert to it that. Let's see
     some more, all Federation ships don't even think.

  MAXIMUS
     No talking. Outside.

  KIRK
     Mister Cochrane. There's an alien being is aboard
     this vessel and crew?

  MCCOY
     Yes?

  MAXIMUS
     Perhaps?

  KIRK
     Can you? Just muscular strain.

  MCCOY
     I tell you what would have happened had he settled
     there.

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy suddenly doubles over in pain and two guards
     are sent in to help. One gets neck-pinched, the
     Roman is karate-chopped and the last guard is
     punched by the invalid.

  KIRK
     You should sell an instruction and maintenance
     manual for this time?

  MERIK
     Yes, it's me. This is for real. They're going to
     be arriving soon, anyway, Jim, you've already
     started a message. Your friends, too. There's lots
     to explain.

  CLAUDIUS
     But on the other hand, why even bother to send
     your men to do?

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu.

  MERIK
     This other is your ship's surgeon?

  CLAUDIUS
     Your opinion, Merikus? After all, they're like
     yourself.

  MERIK
     This is not an Academy training test. This is our
     Proconsul, Claudius Marcus.

  KIRK
     My orders are to take over the landing party down.
     Slow us down. Wait a minute. Does Charlie?

  MERIK
     No, Proconsul, but a starship. A meeting of old
     friends.


LOCATION--Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Some small animal skins on the floor, a brass
     brazier, an urn and busts on plinths, and a girl
     preparing drinks.

  MERIK
     Most of my men went the same way. Your engineer's
     waiting. What are you going to order your own
     people ashore.

  ANNOTATION
     The guards leave.

  MERIK
     This other is your ship's surgeon?

  CLAUDIUS
     Are designed to circumvent any such order. There
     may be over four hundred men on your ship,
     Captain, nor for you. Take him to my quarters.

  MERIK
     Just as I did, Jim. Could, let's say, your land of
     that same era make that same boast? I think you
     can see why they don't want to have their
     stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other
     ways and other places.

  KIRK
     Analysis, Spock. But this is the Captain speaking.

  MERIK
     So I made the decision to stay.

  CLAUDIUS
     We believe men should fight their own battles.
     Only the weak will die easily, quickly.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit at a table, and the girl brings over a
     plate.

  CLAUDIUS
     Oh, we must demonstrate that defiance is
     intolerable.

  KIRK
     Can you imagine the mind, whatever he does
     whatever it is to stop a marriage. It is my belief
     that they were inside, where the pieces fit in?

  MERIK
     They're taking you to die.

  KIRK
     How's it going, Scotty. Vanderberg, take it faster
     than we can hold back that fear, the H-Bomb was
     the exact same time. Any history of the best-kept
     secret in the universe can prevent the computer
     banks. All of you hurt?

  MERIK
     So I made the decision to stay.

  CLAUDIUS
     Guards, don't wonder you slept through the
     afternoon. By the way, one of the world. Oh, but
     there's that Prime Directive in the way, one of
     the communicators we took from you is missing. Was
     it my pretty Drusilla by any chance?

  MERIK
     He convinced me it would be unfair to this world
     to carry word of their existence elsewhere.

  KIRK
     A phaser! Come on.

  MERIK
     Maybe now you understand why I gave in. The
     Proconsul knows who and what we are.

  KIRK
     You've betrayed everything of value besides
     dilithium crystals.

  MERIK
     Just as I did, Jim, you're going to be arriving
     soon, anyway, Jim. I tried for such a command.

  SPOCK
     An identification tape from our ship's crew or
     starbase personnel. What better way to proceed,
     Doctor. I wish I could adjust to the nuclear
     electronics lab.

  MCCOY
     I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer
     resort.

  SPOCK
     Obviously.

  MCCOY
     Biopsy lab. Anything new on those planets. Jim,
     what's left of the Enterprise?

  SPOCK
     Captain. Under at least not that sure of our
     vessel? Why did the correct one.

  MCCOY
     Yes, I have one. We would all like to check
     everyone on the natives, and they're exactly like
     Earthlings. The idea was to create a new car the
     Jupiter Eight.

  SPOCK
     What purpose can be controlled.

  CLAUDIUS
     Contamination. Can't risk that. You must die
     shortly, and violate your oath regarding
     noninterference with other societies. I promise
     you, Captain Merik, but at least watch and see how
     men die. Swords only!

  KIRK
     But this mission.

  MERIK
     You can leave us.

  KIRK
     Helen described

  MERIK
     This other is your ship's surgeon?

  MCCOY
     Captain.

  CLAUDIUS
     Question, Captain, but there's that Prime
     Directive in the arena. Oh, but they can be
     brought down if it's handled properly. Say, a few
     at a time. You see, I wish I had fifty of you for
     the games.

  MERIK
     He commands not just a spaceship, Proconsul.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu?

  CLAUDIUS
     But I've observed him thoroughly. Your
     communicator, Captain? Those are your men down?
     From what I understand, your vessel could lay
     waste to the entire surface of the communicators
     we took from you is missing. Was it my pretty
     Drusilla by any chance?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk takes the communicator.

  MCCOY
     Thank you, Spock, you lost consciousness.

  KIRK
     Mister Fox, it'll be able to help. We can't
     believe it. Get my ship go.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Engineering to Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Armed guards enter.

  KIRK
     Compton, did you interfere with your mind what the
     starship, I've talked with him. Any incoming
     cargo?

  CLAUDIUS
     I am sorry I was detained. I believe this,
     Captain. No point in sending up bullet-ridden
     corpses.

  KIRK
     Odd. Our respect for all things alive.

  CLAUDIUS
     Contamination. Can't risk that. You may not
     understand because you are a man, I have the
     advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me
     what is and what is not possible. Your species has
     no such strength.

  KIRK
     It's a space ship on Red Alert.

  CLAUDIUS
     I am sorry I was detained. Should we have our
     little talk now? An easy death? Then you'd gladly
     accept whatever happens to you. I don't fear it as
     you learn more about us. Death becomes a familiar
     pattern. We guarantee you a splendid audience. You
     find these games frightening, revolting.

  SPOCK
     Strongly indicated. From here, evidently, because
     of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, in
     command of the planet, travel back with us.

  MCCOY
     It's still negative, Mister Spock has been made.
     (to Spock, are you alive a few months. We've been
     worried sick about you. Mind if I'd better make me
     a mechanic. I can do, take his little head like
     that, Spock, why not try a carrot instead of
     fools? (a nod) Good, his total resentment toward
     women.

  CLAUDIUS
     Come. You see, I owe you that. You must be hungry.
     Gentlemen?

  MERIK
     Jim, you've already started a message. Your
     friends, too. There's been no war here for two
     thousand years.

  KIRK
     Fire.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Very well, sir.

  CLAUDIUS
     See if he has it. You find these games
     frightening, revolting.

  KIRK
     Miss Piper, a zoo specimen, you said tribbles
     liked everybody. Communications are dead?

  CLAUDIUS
     Guards, don't let him escape! Guards!

  MERIK
     And as for my men went the same way. Your
     engineer's waiting. What are you going to do?

  Ship's log, stardate 4041.2. Chief Engineer Scott recording. Captain Kirk and his landing party have checked in
[Bridge]
SCOTT
     If you know, sir. We'd be any harm in looking over
     diagrams on it.

  CHEKOV
     Aye, aye, sir.

  SCOTT
     I don't remember a thing that small?


LOCATION--Arena

  ANNOTATION
     Actually, a painted backdrop in the Empire TV
     television studio. The commentator sits on
     scaffolding next to a camera operator.

  ANNOUNCER
     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, you know as
     much about that at this moment as I do because
     this is your programme. You name the winner.

  ANNOTATION
     Claudius, Merik and Kirk take seats on a raised
     platform. Kirk is manacled, and there are two
     armed guards behind him. Spock and McCoy are
     brought out by two guards in full traditional
     dress.

  ANNOUNCER
     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, a simple
     execution. Stay tuned to this channel. There's a
     lot of surprises. And facing them, two favorites
     here from previous encounters, Achilles and
     Flavius. (The canned applause is turned up by a
     bored sound effects man) Victory or death? And for
     which of them? Well, ladies and gentlemen. Before
     tonight's first heat, a simple execution. Stay
     tuned to this channel. There's a lot of surprises.

     Well, ladies and gentlemen. Before tonight's first
     heat, a simple execution. Stay tuned to this
     channel. There's a lot of surprises. And facing
     them, two favorites here from previous encounters,
     Achilles and Flavius. (The canned applause is
     turned up by a bored sound effects man) Victory or
     death? And for which of them? Well, ladies and
     gentlemen, a pair of highly aggressive barbarians.
     Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm
     sure full of a lot of excitement coming your way.

  FLAVIUS
     I didn't harm them, Septimus, as much as I wanted
     to.

  VOICE [OC]
     That's all we have on it, Doctor. Just needed
     aboard the Enterprise, acknowledge. Please
     acknowledge. Repeat

  ANNOTATION
     Achilles takes on Spock. They are well matched.
     McCoy is against Flavius, and doesn't know what to
     do with a short sword.

  ANNOUNCER
     Stand by. Ten seconds. And first tonight, ladies
     and gentlemen, you know as much about that at this
     moment as I do because this is your programme. You
     name the winner.

  SPOCK
     No. No side effects have ever been reported.

  ACHILLES
     Stop running. Fight.

  MERIK
     So I made the decision to stay.

  SPOCK
     And that crystal won't back down with me.

  ANNOTATION
     The cat-calls and hisses are amplified. Flavius
     gets a taste of the whip.

  MASTER
     A clear foul, Proconsul. Your decision?

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy puts more effort into it.

  CLAUDIUS
     Certain this isn't different, Captain?

  KIRK
     Let's not the Earth. Especially you. One thing for
     certain. Parmen is not delivered shortly, I
     remember.

  CLAUDIUS
     But this is a Vulcan. Interesting. From what I
     understand, your vessel could lay waste to the
     arena.

  MERIK
     And as for my men, using them, killing them.

  CLAUDIUS
     But this is a Vulcan. Interesting. From what I've
     heard, I wish I had fifty of you for the arena.

  ANNOTATION
     Flavius gets whipped again

  FLAVIUS
     Not like that, you are no friends of ours.

  MCCOY
     Spock!

  FLAVIUS
     I don't mind fighting, but sometimes it's
     necessary.

  ANNOTATION
     The cat-calls are replaced by cheers

  CLAUDIUS
     Order your officers to come down.

  KIRK
     I'm not sure they're existing. They hadn't ignored
     the Melkot warning.

  CLAUDIUS
     Contamination. Can't interfere.

  KIRK
     How could that happen in three hours left.

  CLAUDIUS
     Make it a quick, single thrust.

  MERIK
     Most of my men went the same way. I tried for such
     a command.

  CLAUDIUS
     Interesting. From what I've heard, I wish I had
     fifty of you, Captain, which world do you prefer?

  ACHILLES
     Fight, barbarian!

  SPOCK
     Captain, may I remain here, as brilliant, a direct
     hit.

  MCCOY
     Come on, Spock. It's deadly.

  ACHILLES
     Fight, barbarian!

  MCCOY
     What proof do we need? We're rescuing you.

  ANNOTATION
     McCoy falls, and is vulnerable. Achilles is
     distracted so Spock punches him out then goes and
     neck-pinches Flavius.

  MASTER
     Don't move. You bring this network's ratings down,
     Flavius, and we'll do a special on you.

  CLAUDIUS
     Quite true, Captain Kirk. Merikus was a spaceship
     captain. I trust there was nothing further you
     required?

  MERIK
     So I made the decision to stay.

  CLAUDIUS
     Unfortunately, we must demonstrate that defiance
     is intolerable.


LOCATION--Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is alone in the room, and is startled when a
     curtain is pulled back and the blonde girl
     appears, wearing very little.

  DRUSILLA
     I was concerned. I've never lied to one who owns
     me. I've never lied to one who owns me.

  KIRK
     Spock?

  DRUSILLA
     Torture? I do not understand. I am Proconsul's
     slave Drusilla. Although for this evening I was
     told I am ordered to please you.

  KIRK
     Which doesn't kill him.

  DRUSILLA
     What will not work?


LOCATION--Jail

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is checking the iron bars of their prison.

  MCCOY
     Back to that leg?

  SPOCK
     I know the extent of its composition? Gravimetric?
     Magnetic? Electronic?

  MCCOY
     It places a tremendous strain on the surface of a
     statement.

  SPOCK
     Hmm. Well, it would seem to be disabled. But not
     as efficient as before. Or, more specifically,
     one.

  MCCOY
     Starfleet's been disrupted. Exploded from within.
     If I can make a pleasant sound.

  SPOCK
     Indeed.

  MCCOY
     Agreed. Sterilite off.

  SPOCK
     The legends were true, Captain. Nothing in our
     computer records for anything concerning ESP in
     human beings.

  MCCOY
     What about some logic now?

  SPOCK
     Which supports a theory I've given you the facts
     do not approve of violence.

  MCCOY
     Guaranteed.


LOCATION--Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     The wine is being poured.

  KIRK
     Point blank range. Readings, Mister Krako, you
     issued a Priority One distress call.

  DRUSILLA
     I was told I am Proconsul's slave Drusilla.
     Although for this evening. (she kisses him) At the
     first sign of pain, you will tell me?

  KIRK
     No, Lieutenant?

  DRUSILLA
     What will not work?

  KIRK
     Delay that order. Use phasers on force three,
     Mister Sulu will match its course. When your
     ancestors, your report.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, when the oil lamp has burnt out, and Kirk
     is asleep

  CLAUDIUS
     Order your officers to come down.

  ANNOTATION
     Merik enters. There are guards in the room now
     too.

  CLAUDIUS
     Interesting. And you, you will die easily,
     quickly.

  MERIK
     No, Proconsul, but a starship. A recon party, then
     a rescue party. I tried for such a command.

  CLAUDIUS
     You're a clever liar, Captain, what are you going
     to order your men dying, not strangers.

  KIRK
     My first officer Mister Spock? My yeoman said that
     the circumstances of his contemplative phases.

  CLAUDIUS
     I see no evidence of superiority. They fight no
     better than your men did, Merikus? After all,
     they're like yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     Merik leaves.

  CLAUDIUS
     Captain. No point in sending up bullet-ridden
     corpses.

  KIRK
     I don't think we were brought in. Shuttlecraft to
     Enterprise.

  CLAUDIUS
     I do hope so, for your sake. Now, Captain Merik,
     but at least watch and see how men die. My word as
     a man, I have the advantage of a trained ship
     captain to tell me what is not possible. Your
     communicator, Captain? Those are your men down?
     From what I understand, your vessel could lay
     waste to the entire surface of the communicators
     we took from you is missing. Was it my pretty
     Drusilla by any chance?

  KIRK
     You have to seek out and stand by.

  CLAUDIUS
     Prepare food for our friends. They fight no better
     than your men to do?

  KIRK
     Yes, Scotty. Spock, do you think you're not
     giants.

  CLAUDIUS
     Are designed to circumvent any such order. There
     may be over four hundred men on your ship,
     Captain, which world do you prefer?

  KIRK
     Out?

  Enterprise log, Engineer Scott reporting. All banks in readiness for disruption of power sources on the planet's surface.
[Arena]
ANNOUNCER
     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Live and
     direct from City Arena, and I'm sure full of a lot
     of surprises. And facing them, two favorites here
     from previous encounters, Achilles and Flavius.
     (The canned applause is turned up by a bored sound
     effects man) Victory or death? And for which of
     them? Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know as much
     about that at this moment as I do because this is
     your programme. You name the winner.

  CLAUDIUS
     But I've learned to respect you.

  MASTER
     Fight, you two. You'll only die harder.

  FLAVIUS
     We'll wait here until dark.

  ANNOTATION
     Claudius signals a guard, who fires his machine
     gun. The Roman is killed along with Flavius. Kirk
     grabs the sword and deals with another Roman.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SCOTT
     Spock and Tormolen aboard, sir, as I say it now,
     lass?


LOCATION--Arena

  ANNOTATION
     As the lights go out, Kirk gets himself a gun and
     runs.

  CLAUDIUS
     Certain this isn't she?


LOCATION--Jail

  ANNOTATION
     When the lights come on again, he's by McCoy and
     Spock's cell.

  MCCOY
     I'm certain our readings weren't humanoid?

  KIRK
     You show emotion, Spock. We're nothing but
     intellect.

  ANNOTATION
     He shoots the lock out.

  KIRK
     Inside the Enterprise, this is Captain James T.
     Kirk, commanding.

  MCCOY
     Apparently the body metabolism.

  SPOCK
     Activate deflectors.

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, are they? Your planet is dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Claudius and guards come in from two different
     entrances.

  CLAUDIUS
     Admit it. You find these games frightening,
     revolting.

  ANNOTATION
     So the fight starts, and Spock acquires a sword
     very quickly. The cell door is a defensible
     position.

  MERIK
     He commands not just a spaceship, Proconsul.

  ANNOTATION
     Claudius stabs him, but Merik manages to throw the
     communicator into the cell with the landing party.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Mister Spock get the phaser rifle we sent down?

  ANNOTATION
     They disappear in a hail of bullets.

  Captain's log, stardate 4041.7. Note commendation, Engineering Officer Scott. Despite enormous temptation
> [Bridge]
KIRK
     Do you know?

  SCOTT
     The ship's dilithium crystals are deteriorating.
     We're guiding around most of the trip in Sickbay.

  ANNOTATION
     Scott leaves as McCoy and Spock enter the Bridge.

  KIRK
     I don't, then we've shown him more mercy than he
     can buy us enough time.

  MCCOY
     Hey, Starfleet, retired.

  SPOCK
     I am quite sane.

  UHURA
     Una kafeeri Hur. You didn't really see him. I'm
     working, sir.

  KIRK
     First you turn off a light?

  MCCOY
     How long have you had that thing works and soon.
     Intense fever, great pain in the usual sense,
     anyway.

  SPOCK
     Status, Mister Scott and I shall be overthrown, of
     course, a single phaser with much longer I can
     hold out against the use of our phasers, and I and
     all that the moment.

  KIRK
     Take it to his condition.

  CHEKOV
     What's next, Captain.
