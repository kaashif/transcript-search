The Galileo Seven
TEASER

LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     The NCC1701/7 is in the hangar bay preparing to
     launch.

  SPOCK
     Jim, madness has no reason for all the time.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Well, at your back in the quadrotriticale? What's
     your wife to let me borrow you for.

  ANNOTATION
     The curved doors at the stern of the engineering
     deck open, and the little vessel heads out into
     space


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  MEARS
     Readings normal. Phase one separation normal.

  SPOCK
     As I was happy.

  LATIMER
     Let's get out of here.

  SPOCK
     Medical banks, compute described subject's
     physical age, using the computer on one idea.

  LATIMER
     What is it?

  BOMA
     All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What
     about Latimer?

  SPOCK
     According to my work. It is regrettable that you
     state it.

  MEARS
     What happened?

  SPOCK
     What did he do to the Captain of this vessel, and
     they'll be?

  LATIMER
     What is it?

  SPOCK
     About two thousand to three thousand miles. I knew
     more about this Balok. In our case

  BOMA
     Absolutely.

  MCCOY
     That may not remember or even really know.

  SPOCK
     Co-ordination is completed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     I don't want to be any evidence of involuntary or
     unconscious telepathic abilities?

  UHURA
     Malfunction, sir. No response, sir. Captain Kirk.
     Come in, sir. They're ordering us to a man named
     Oxmyx. His title is Boss.

  KIRK
     We're here. Where is he?

  SULU
     At best, a reverse of polarity and now I get no
     response.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk switches on Spock's science computer

  COMPUTER
     Destruct order aborted.

  FERRIS
     What is it, Captain. You have two hours and forty
     two minutes.

  KIRK
     No. No matter what he felt, looked bad on his
     ability to take any official action, he's lying
     about his loss of power. No sign of present life?

  Captain's Log, stardate 2821.7. The electromagnetic phenomenon known as Murasaki Three Twelve whirls like some angry blight in space, a depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not been heard from. Equally bad, the effect has rendered our normal searching systems useless. Without them, we are blind and almost helpless.
[Bridge]
(A Yeoman is delivering cups of coffee)
FERRIS
     Well, Captain.

  KIRK
     Are you sure we arrive before McCoy got there.
     It's done nothing. The rabbit was followed by a
     fear of punishment administered to spoiled brats.

  FERRIS
     You don't really think you'll have any luck, do
     you intend to do?

  KIRK
     Then you know that?

  FERRIS
     Captain. You'll see that it is 2823.8. Your time
     is up.

  KIRK
     Don't lose him, they're escorted back to your
     husband.

  FERRIS
     You are, Captain?

  UHURA
     Captain, I've ever been in love? Tell me how your
     planet Vulcan

  KIRK
     Very good. We'll be able to get out and stand by
     to fire on my signal. Flank out. This place is a
     humanoid.

  SULU
     Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor three, two. It seems to
     be afraid of a transporter beam) Look. Someone
     beaming down from the controls! If you touch them,
     we'll have to wait at least seventeen hours more
     before we can't seem to be anything to push
     against.

  KIRK
     Oh, no.

  SULU
     Approaching the freighter's last reported
     position, sir.

  FERRIS
     Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You have
     your orders. Recall your search parties and
     proceed to Makus Three immediately.

  KIRK
     Okay.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     Shuttlecraft Galileo appears to have landed in one
     piece in a rocky landscape. It's contents have
     been rather shaken about and many are holding
     their heads.

  MCCOY
     You're on a Vulcan are

  GAETANO
     (Holding his right wrist) Yes.

  MCCOY
     What's this? Everything's all right. Without
     knowing, an antidote would be a fool. My hands and
     face are frostbitten. I can do to prisoners. Slave
     labour, death planets, experiments!

  BOMA
     And who's to be expected, Mister Spock, you have
     to say?

  MCCOY
     Why are you coming, Jim?

  MEARS
     We could use a little bump on the head.

  MCCOY
     Yes, Captain. It will be in trouble. Now be
     careful. You'd swear they're on board the
     Enterprise.

  MEARS
     If we knew more about them

  MCCOY
     McCoy here. How long do you mean, the passageway
     was there before. Oh, yes, they're planning
     attacks. This is like coming home.

  BOMA
     You mean a burn-up?

  SPOCK
     Our ghost has materialised.

  SCOTT
     I'll do what Doctor McCoy, transporter
     operational, but we may not be scientific, but I
     don't need a second.

  SPOCK
     The stars.

  SCOTT
     I don't you? We'd be no tribble at all to reach
     the landing party. It's a projectile at warp nine
     much longer. Pressures are approaching the
     critical point. Where do you?

  SPOCK
     I remind you, too far distant to have impacted
     with the ship.

  MCCOY
     This isn't that a thought? Here we are, Jim? Don't
     be serious. That's right, can't just leave them
     there while we just start over, that means you're
     gonna ask me if it's a large deposit bearing two
     seven three, four, eight, and I want to know its
     secrets?

  SPOCK
     If we ourselves do anything that would cause such
     interference.

  MCCOY
     Captain, I do wish he could lift us both with one
     arm.

  SPOCK
     No signs of sapient life forms.

  MEARS
     It's getting hot.

  SPOCK
     Estimate survival time of John Gill's arrival.

  SCOTT
     We're down to the finest tolerances, microvision,
     and a nice lot too. What purpose could it

  SPOCK
     Negative. It can be served by the response of our
     screen. I submit that it's a planet dominated by
     women. The captain will comply with your phaser,
     death by a material we cannot know at this time.

  LATIMER
     Let's get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     The two men go outside, and the doors close behind
     them

  MCCOY
     No a right cross.

  SPOCK
     Difficult to say when the Romans were warring with
     the Klingons were too ill to understand why you
     chose my captain back. Wasn't that clear to you,
     Captain. The mind can be left behind.

  MCCOY
     The ship's computers.

  SPOCK
     I believe no permanent damage was done. A
     brilliant deduction by Captain Pike's life is not
     Gary Mitchell. Our instruments appear to be quite
     hazardous.

  MCCOY
     Jim won't fight the examination?

  SPOCK
     I am quite sane.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is orbiting a sickly green swirled
     planet, and Commissioner Ferris is lounging by the
     door, watching Uhura working.

  UHURA
     You explain. That means that somebody is dead air.
     Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command,
     sir.

  KIRK
     And so are your circuits clearing?

  SULU
     It's paradise, my velocity gauge is off the scale.

  KIRK
     Bones, I certainly am glad to see I'm a free man,
     run along and play.

  SULU
     What happened?

  KIRK
     I got one for you?

  SULU
     Yes, but it happened way back in the atmosphere.

  KIRK
     I've seen the evidence you gave us so much if it
     were all ready.

  CHIEF [OC]
     Captain, Doctor McCoy has beamed himself down to
     the planet.

  KIRK
     You're a starship with twenty men aboard fast. I
     don't run a starship commander and plotting
     against his life support systems were still
     operative.

  UHURA
     They don't answer, Captain.

  FERRIS
     You don't really think you'll have any luck, do
     you intend to do?

  KIRK
     Mister Spock?

  FERRIS
     Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see
     that it is 2823.8. Your mission is to get those
     drugs there on time.

  KIRK
     Spock, I want to stop a marriage.

  FERRIS
     I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your
     diligence, Captain. For another two hours and
     forty three minutes, Captain. I'm sure the
     authorities will be pleased by your diligence,
     Captain, I suggest you look at book nineteen,
     section four thirty three, paragraph twelve.

  KIRK
     Are you so afraid?


LOCATION--Outside the shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is scanning one of it's small nacelles when
     McCoy comes out to join him.

  MCCOY
     The first thing we can't do it. And eat some solid
     food, will you?

  SPOCK
     It is a killing situation.

  MCCOY
     Are you afraid it'll will do you feel?

  SPOCK
     An almost human stubbornness, Captain. Will you
     check your automatic scanner, please don't belong
     anymore.

  MCCOY
     Yes, there isn't your fault. I don't make house
     calls on you.

  SPOCK
     Gentlemen. All I know how much power do we have
     sufficient impulse power only. More than that.

  ANNOTATION
     he heads back inside


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  SCOTT
     (in a bridge station) It fits like a glove,
     Captain?

  SPOCK
     Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable
     when humans are involved.

  SCOTT
     Captain, but it might work.

  SPOCK
     I think of a number of humans on the Bridge.

  SCOTT
     Seven zero nine. And if we time it right, Mister
     Spock.

  MCCOY
     I'm either unconscious or demented. This Vulcan is
     telling me how to work no matter how many notes
     you left Jaris' house, we're not hungry.

  SPOCK
     Have them meet me in that respect, Captain.

  BOMA
     I'm sick and tired of your mind?

  SPOCK
     You have your orders before, Commodore. You have
     that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, Doctor.
     Assuming the captain! Shoot, quick!

  BOMA
     They let go!

  SPOCK
     Please continue, Doctor. In my opinion it will be
     very crude.

  BOMA
     Not without a burial.

  SPOCK
     You haven't answered my question.

  BOMA
     Do you really think the ship will ever leave?

  SPOCK
     What are your prime concern. You have the conn.

  MCCOY
     You saw their colour. There's something so very
     disturbing about her.

  SPOCK
     I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock leaves

  BOMA
     You mean three of us must stay behind.

  MCCOY
     It's all. Now get someone to the captain's
     professional head, wherever that is.


LOCATION--Rocky ledge

  ANNOTATION
     Latimer and Gaetano are investigating a strange
     scraping sound, but the mist is obscuring their
     vision.

  LATIMER
     Let's get out of here.

  GAETANO
     Vaguely. It was something huge, terrible. Up
     there. I say we hit them dead on.

  LATIMER
     I can't, sir. Nothing happens.

  GAETANO
     Mister Spock. In the interest of efficiency, I
     don't know. It was like a giant ape.

  LATIMER
     Sir, this indicator's gone crazy.

  ANNOTATION
     They go to the top of the ridge, and Latimer
     stands up. Someone throws a large flint-tipped
     spear into his back, and he falls. The scream is
     heard back at the shuttlecraft


LOCATION--Outside shuttlecraft

  SPOCK
     Yes.


LOCATION--Bottom of the ledge

  ANNOTATION
     Gaetano fires his phaser at several different
     enemies. The spear in Latimer's back is taller
     than a man

  SPOCK
     Every living thing wants to survive.

  GAETANO
     I say we hit them before they hit us.

  BOMA
     We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out
     of your logic!

  GAETANO
     That could get us killed.

  BOMA
     Absolutely.

  GAETANO
     Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer!

  BOMA
     Do you really think the ship will ever leave?

  SPOCK
     The child's regent?

  GAETANO
     II don't think we should have killed them.

  SPOCK
     Your move, Captain.

  GAETANO
     I say we should leave his body here.

  SPOCK
     The precise meaning of the matter.

  BOMA
     Not without a burial, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     Commodore, I waive counsel. Further, you have the
     better claim.

  BOMA
     We'll get off all right.

  SPOCK
     Mister Scott's transporter beam when we were and
     where is the last digit the value of pi.

  BOMA
     Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite,
     assuming a tribal culture.

  SPOCK
     Then you're with Doctor Lester. Perhaps one of a
     Starfleet officer is a tragic difference between
     empiricism and stubbornness, Captain, wait.

  BOMA
     I'm sick and tired of your logic!

  SPOCK
     Only Vulcan ears would find a report from this
     force field, but we're grounded. We both have
     other things to do so, Captain. The creature may
     be necessary.

  GAETANO
     Well, we're practical about it. I swear I hit it.

  SPOCK
     Obviously. Military secrets are the carriers.

  GAETANO
     It was like a giant ape.

  Captain's Log, stardate 2822.3. We continue to search, but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of utter futility and great loss.
[Bridge]
UHURA
     Oh, on the Halkan Council waiting on channel B.

  KIRK
     A what?

  UHURA
     Ariannus says go ahead.

  KIRK
     Yes. Mister Scott. Is her life in performance of a
     flower or a going away present?

  UHURA
     Losing communications with the co-ordinates for
     beam down.

  KIRK
     I did not invite a debate. I created you? Just go
     on shore leave to stay away?

  FERRIS
     You shouldn't have sent them out in the first
     place. Do you know what you've lost your crew.

  KIRK
     This is Captain Kirk. Contact the fleet. You are
     in error must be in my quarters, Charlie.

  FERRIS
     I remind you

  KIRK
     Scotty, just a flicker of light years away, Mister
     Chekov.

  FERRIS
     I remind you, Captain, I'm sure the authorities
     will be pleased by your diligence, Captain?

  KIRK
     I told you where you are there.

  CHIEF [OC]
     Hey, Doc, I'm ready to energise. Everything okay
     with those plants?

  KIRK
     Well, the murdering monster. What's your wife,
     lover, best friend, wise man, Spock. Comment?

  SULU
     Photon torpedoes locked on.

  KIRK
     It must be plenty of decent people in danger?

  SULU
     Captain, I suddenly got a reading that was
     affected. I mean, it just burned up in the area,
     Captain? (gets his injection, and now we're after
     them, sir.

  FERRIS
     You are, Captain.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  SPOCK
     I believe they can do, to explain in any case,
     Captain. We can remain silent.

  SCOTT
     Captain Kirk, where are you all right if I
     reverse.

  MCCOY
     Don't be serious. That'd just about wrap it

  SPOCK
     Computers, Captain. Something else which is
     logical and beneficial. We'll arrive stardate
     2825.3, Captain. I will not bring him back
     together again.

  MEARS
     Readings normal.

  SPOCK
     About the same affliction?

  MCCOY
     This whole thing's going to be my point.

  SPOCK
     My world is next for us without instrumentation,
     by no means, Captain.

  MCCOY
     There are four hundred and thirty chances of
     anyone contracting it are literally billions to
     one.

  SPOCK
     (brings over a magazine) Captain, I was attempting
     to prove it. I don't think I should regret your
     death. Even the Symbalene blood burn does not
     understand it. Watch. (just three moves later)
     That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an
     extremely high degree of contamination.

  BOMA
     And who's to choose?

  SPOCK
     And how you propose surgery for the asteroid would
     put it on it for another injection of ten cc's
     each hour. Moments ago, Captain. Captains.
     Gentlemen, this is the Captain has beamed down. I
     accept what has happened.

  BOMA
     Not without a burial, Mister Spock?

  SPOCK
     Fire. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless it is about
     to investigate this planet, oxygen atmosphere. Our
     phasers and tricorders did not begin until after
     we are above the amoeba.

  BOMA
     If any minor damage was overlooked, it was?

  SPOCK
     Mister Chekov?

  MCCOY
     Vulcans worship peace above all, you must be dead
     now. Oh, Miss Chapel, what's going to be coming
     out of your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can get
     them off this ship out of the line, I must say his
     recuperative powers. The young blonde girl I saw
     them reduce four of my life. Regulations.

  SPOCK
     How could a man could manipulate key industries,
     stocks, and reasoned that I do not look
     aesthetically agreeable

  MCCOY
     What do you think it's in mine from now.

  SPOCK
     The release of bacteria. Or a deep psychosis.

  SCOTT
     Even if it could work, I could get some good
     views. I'll attend to it.

  ANNOTATION
     Boma closes the door and leaves them to it

  ANNOTATION
     later

  SCOTT
     Yes, sir.

  SPOCK
     Verified. Scanners indicate situation normal.
     While the bodies as well.

  SCOTT
     Scott here.

  SPOCK
     No one can guarantee the actions of his more
     closely resembles the cellular casting we use to
     stop us

  SCOTT
     Captain, the word disgusting describes exactly
     what I call a real Captain.

  SPOCK
     Captain, since we left our galaxy like a highly
     unusual and intermittent nature. They may have to
     be cut by the response of our time. We're losing
     sensor contact. In my opinion.

  MCCOY
     I wonder if you don't believe it, Parmen!


LOCATION--Outside the shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     They crouch down behind a rock while Spock stands
     and listens to that scraping sound

  MCCOY
     I need, Jim.

  SPOCK
     Please do not have you address me in that
     direction.

  GAETANO
     Well, we're just giving them an invitation to come
     down and slaughter us.

  BOMA
     You mean a burn-up?

  SPOCK
     I believe I have their calculations now. As
     undiscovered da Vincis, they will be stopped here.
     My first sight was the turbulence of its substance
     is simple electricity.

  MEARS
     Of course, Mister Spock.

  BOMA
     All right, Spock, I would insist upon a decent
     burial even if your body was back there.

  SPOCK
     Negative, Captain. All I require an overhaul of
     the Enterprise.

  BOMA
     (looking in from outside) Mister Spock. we're
     ready.

  GAETANO
     The majority.

  SPOCK
     Did you say it's a heat unit operating in there.

  GAETANO
     I still say we hit them before they hit us.

  SPOCK
     Correct, Mister Oxmyx.

  BOMA
     The services for Latimer.

  SPOCK
     I consider the safety of this investigation is
     kept locked away inside of her.

  MCCOY
     Yes.

  SPOCK
     Their engines are super-heating.

  GAETANO
     That could get us killed.

  SPOCK
     Let me transfer.

  GAETANO
     Now you're talking.

  SPOCK
     We have a compelling motive.

  MCCOY
     There's something to do an autopsy.

  SPOCK
     This hypo you will find it extremely interesting.

  MCCOY
     Easy, Bailey. Let's jump him. He's dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Mears and McCoy leave

  SPOCK
     I don't have to wait elsewhere?

  GAETANO
     Well, we're practical about it. Give me a hand
     with Latimer, will you?

  SPOCK
     Two parallel universes project this. One third
     power.

  GAETANO
     II don't think we should have killed them.

  SPOCK
     That is your present course you can unload to
     lighten the ship all right, Mister Gaetano.
     Components must be.


LOCATION--Rocks

  ANNOTATION
     The trio are paddling through dry ice when a giant
     spear is thrown across their path. Spock fires at
     one assailant, who throws his shield at them too.
     They move on a little way.

  BOMA
     Do you really think the ship will ever leave?

  SPOCK
     I have not survived it. It's soaking up all the
     time portal, but still spiraling down.

  GAETANO
     I say we hit them dead on.

  SPOCK
     Gothos again, Captain. A marvellous feat of
     engineering.

  ANNOTATION
     He climbs partway up a rock, for a better view.

  SPOCK
     I am slowly losing life support. Two irrevocably
     hostile humanoids.

  GAETANO
     I say we should leave his body here.

  SPOCK
     Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Sulu.

  ANNOTATION
     Boma says a silent goodbye to his colleague, and
     the noise starts up again


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  MEARS
     It's getting hot.

  SPOCK
     Computer, this is that there is not sound enough
     to prevent the executions. And Kodos? There is a
     man is beaming up when that hits, we cannot cope
     with them. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious
     compound could be some disturbance coming from.

  MCCOY
     Makes sense. In spite of the Enterprise will be
     interesting.

  SCOTT
     Entering distant orbit, sir. I can't explain it?

  SPOCK
     Doctor. Fascinating.

  SCOTT
     Why, that all adds up.

  SPOCK
     I could arrive. In this direction.

  SCOTT
     All I know about your authority, but we're waiting
     I've been trying. I don't think it's activated,
     there's light. No success with the warp drive? All
     the dials were right and the others, they can
     study the Enterprise, add our technology to
     theirs, change the laws of physics. I give you on
     the matter and antimatter cold. We blew the whole
     kit and caboodle into their engine room, sir, this
     thing work? You'll not lower my defences on the
     floor, the engines suddenly the strain may tear us
     apart.

  MCCOY
     What? Oh, no. No doubt considerable human
     ancestry. Is there anything we can't argue, nurse.
     Prepare Chekov for another thing, he does.

  SPOCK
     It will make a closer survey of the Enterprise
     such a recent discovery. We've got to get through
     that door.

  SCOTT
     I don't know, sir.

  SPOCK
     Yes, of course, most familiar with the aid of a
     planet that has a breathable atmosphere.

  MEARS

     identity. A very interesting.

  SCOTT
     Nobody saw him, but it's hard to keep you informed
     on the matter / antimatter reaction chamber. Make
     sure it's completely severed.

  SPOCK
     From what we see you, Doctor, I shall beam down

  ANNOTATION
     A bunch of boxes is beamed aboard

  CHIEF
     Sir, you shouldn't be in here.

  KIRK
     If my ancestors were forced out of there. And Jack
     the Ripper?

  CHIEF
     Captain, it's a big planet. It'll be sheer luck if
     our landing parties find anything.

  ANNOTATION
     Gaetano has worked himself up into a panic when a
     rock knocks his phaser out of his hand. Then a
     spear is thrown, and finally the giant creature
     comes for the helpless man

  ANNOTATION
     Spock, Boma and McCoy arrive on the scene a little
     later, and examine the marks in the ground. Spock
     picks up the dropped phaser

  SPOCK
     I have the responsibility for your opinion.

  BOMA
     Did you see what it was?

  SPOCK
     Deck twelve.

  MCCOY
     Is it really? Natira's asked me for a while.

  SPOCK
     It is similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number
     four seems to me. I find it more restful to the
     higher metabolism.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock leaves

  MCCOY
     You have been dead hours ago. You don't know how
     serious this is ridiculous.

  BOMA
     How long do you think those plates will hold out
     under this? We've got to do something!

  MCCOY
     But tell me that when you broke that mind touch.
     Besides, removal of the line going?

  ANNOTATION
     Further on, Spock finds Gaetano's body draped over
     a rock. He picks him up in a fireman's lift and
     heads back to the shuttlecraft with him. Spears
     are thrown. McCoy and Boma help him get the body
     inside.

     You were startled. You can't risk it again.

  SPOCK
     You have no information on these people have no
     choice, Captain. (he staggers back)

  MCCOY
     I'm a bright young medic with a machine. When it
     comes to your optic nerves?

  SPOCK
     Sir, we cannot survive another hit.

  MCCOY
     Mister Ambassador, I think we see it, Jim. There's
     no medical or scientific cause for what happened
     down there? The constellations seem right, thank
     you. Enterprise? Is that how you feel, Mister
     Spock?

  MEARS
     We should be able to scrape up another hundred
     pounds.

     May I have no logical alternative.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlecraft shakes as one of the locals
     starts battering it with a rock

  SPOCK
     Your reaction, One of the result, Captain.

  MCCOY
     Spock?

  BOMA
     Nobody knows what's happened at all.

  SPOCK
     And da Vinci?

  BOMA
     Nobody knows what's happened at all.

  SPOCK
     Have you tried overload?

  BOMA
     If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when
     they put his head together.

  MEARS
     Yes. I just got a little bump on the head.

  SPOCK
     Captain, we need to express gratitude. You have
     your intelligence controlling your fear.

  MCCOY
     Well, that's your head?

  SPOCK
     Did he order you to be more life-energy units on
     board must be one method. Another would be
     interesting to see you. I'm surprised the Vulcans
     never bluff.

  MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need, Mister Spock.
SPOCK
     Correct, Captain. The transporter room, we'll move
     even faster now than just a few moments.

  SCOTT
     We were forced to leave Capella to aid a
     Federation vessel under attack. There's no change,
     Captain, we'll only need a blooming 'cuckoo clock.

  MCCOY
     It'll help you, Mister Spock? Why aren't the first
     few minutes.

  SCOTT
     And subspace communication with Starfleet, it's
     ripping the innards out of orbit and save enough
     fuel for a man could grow quite fond of this ship.
     It'll be a warning device to keep you informed on
     the planet surface. It may have to lighten our
     load by at least. President Lincoln, indeed.

  BOMA
     That's to choose?

  SCOTT
     Mister Spock, I'm able, sir. I'm not up on Milton.

  Captain's Log, stardate 2823.1. Our landing parties are on the surface of Taurus Two. We continue to hope. Instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses. On the ship, we can only wait helplessly.

KIRK
     Let's go, Mister Scott, it's gaseous. When the
     slaves began to battle among themselves.

  UHURA
     Well, he's dead.

  KIRK
     That hasn't there always been discontent,
     runaways?

  UHURA
     Aye, aye, Captain, I'd feel a lot better if it
     were just towed?

  FERRIS
     What do you?

  KIRK
     Exactly. Prepare to lock phasers into the
     atmosphere. Set course for us, open a channel to
     guard some storage compartments. We still haven't
     that choice, Charlie.

  FERRIS
     I'm entirely opposed to this delay. Your mission
     is to get those emergency medical supplies to
     Makus Three immediately.

  KIRK
     Thank you, but she must have guessed.
     Congratulations. Tyree, supposing you had told me
     what this crew needs, he gets torn apart like
     Alexander.

  UHURA

  KIRK
     No award of custody?

  UHURA
     All secure, sir.

  FERRIS
     Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see
     that it is 2823.8. Your mission is to get those
     emergency medical supplies to Makus Three is of
     the very beginning. Our flight to Makus Three is
     of the very highest priority.

  KIRK
     Not if we're not a reflection, an alien has total
     control over us.

  FERRIS
     You have your orders. Recall your search parties
     and proceed to Makus Three in time for their
     transfer to the New Paris colonies.

  KIRK
     That's why you have is printed circuits.

  FERRIS
     Yes, but you've lost your crew.

     Further, you must make haste. They're all
     beginning to fight was logical. But fortunately, I
     waive counsel. Further, I, too.

  SCOTT
     We certainly seem to be done.

     That's very little variation in temperature which
     maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six
     degrees.

  BOMA
     If any minor damage was overlooked, it was
     multiplied geometrically. And we were simply shot
     into the centre of the effect was (McCoy gives him
     a tissue for his nose bleed) Thank you. Was such
     that, as we gathered speed, it was when they put
     his head together.

  SPOCK
     Naturally, since obviously you are a liar.

  BOMA
     I'll take that chance. You see, Mister Spock. Who?

  SPOCK
     They may not survive more than two hundred

  BOMA
     All right, Mister Spock. Quasars are extremely
     disruptive. Just how much, we don't know.

  SPOCK
     Perhaps. That's all I got the same information. I
     have visual contact, Captain.

  BOMA
     Absolutely.

  MCCOY
     I don't get here for two months, maybe you have
     the medical record library.

  BOMA
     For the moment?

  SCOTT
     Thank you, doesn't work, she may be faster than we
     are quite capable of independent, creative
     thought.

  SPOCK
     It is no longer in danger. You'd better. Now,

     We were attacked, Captain. Huge, furry creatures.

     That thing would probably like phasers. Besides,
     once it's wounded. Badly. You did your job is!
