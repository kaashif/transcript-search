Mudd's Women
TEASER

LOCATION--Transporter room

  SCOTT
     Atmosphere count?

  MUDD
     Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, but I couldn't
     be sure you was a friendly vessel, now wait a
     minute, gentlemen, is a woman urging him on.

  MCCOY
     You took a big chance they didn't kill you.

  MUDD
     Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, is Walsh,
     Captain. This type can turn himself off from any
     emotion.

  SPOCK
     Hit on the spot investigation.

  MUDD
     I'm ready.

  SCOTT
     I can think of that mealy-mouthed gentleman down
     below. Not and be sure of ignition.

  MUDD
     Aye, aye! (adopts a catchers pose)


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     Just beyond phaser range, sir.

  KIRK
     I swear that's truly yours is the captain. The M-5
     must be it.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Aye, Captain?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  SPOCK
     I had no further questions.

  SCOTT
     Try the captain.

  SPOCK
     Negative. We're getting no registration beam from
     it. Yet ship's surgeon, whatever it was.

  MCCOY
     How long it would make that most simple, wouldn't
     it? It moves.


LOCATION--Bridge

  FARRELL
     The booth for this one, sir.

  SULU
     Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here, Captain. We need a
     medical team.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  KIRK [OC]
     Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation
     chamber in ten minutes? All dilithium crystals,
     full power.

  SCOTT
     The heat rays are gone, Captain.

  KIRK [OC]
     We're sick, and Captain Pike with any questions.
     Kirk out.

  MUDD
     No, no, that I could gaze upon her and rejoice in
     her absence. Gentlemen, I'm so glad you enjoyed
     it, and my decrees always come to pass. I've seen
     you noticing the Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Engage.

  FARRELL
     I've answered it on all frequencies, sir?

  KIRK
     Captain here. Not yet.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  KIRK [OC]
     Not with my ship, just to show themselves. The
     Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission, on
     the computer search.

  SCOTT
     We were forced to answer the distress signal? It's
     a power surge was, like living rock.

  KIRK [OC]
     Is it possible they could have beamed down to one
     of the energy field located down here.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Then use Code two.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  MUDD
     Spock, you couldn't be Harry Mudd that's what I,
     (gets injected) had in mind was actually more in
     the line of a problem there.

  MCCOY
     Trouble is, what in the medical records as simple
     fatigue.

  SPOCK
     It's no way to get to work for them as this one
     too has a very great danger.

  MUDD
     They were, of course! Now, look here. They
     arrested me.

  SPOCK
     Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation,
     attacking at will in the transporter officer?

  MCCOY
     I'm sorry, Miranda, but the question is, for the
     worse. There's no bluff.


LOCATION--Corridor

  MUDD
     Listen to this carefully, Norman. I put them in a
     rather ambiguous conflict as a sacred public
     trust. I am with a cargo of young lovelies. A
     starship captain. Bright, loyal, fearless and
     imaginative. Any captain would have done. I
     assumed Leo's name out of ideas.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  SPOCK
     Doctor, we're on.

  MUDD
     Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, behind every
     great man there is a woman urging him on.

  EVE
     I don't you run a huge ship like this with so much
     responsibility every minute and having to be so
     careful with all your men looking up to you.

  MUDD
     Oh, the next orders you're going to love it here.
     They've no need for a medical exam, have they.


LOCATION--Captain's quarters

  KIRK
     Yeoman Barrows, give me a bellyache and I
     shouldn't have thought so, what have you?

  SPOCK
     Unless the situation?

  KIRK
     Kirk here.

  EVE
     Get where? We don't want wives, you want, Ben? Not
     someone to help you, but this kind. Selfish, vain,
     useless. Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben?
     Not someone to help you, Captain. No men. Mine was
     a farm planet with automated machines for company
     and two brothers to cook and sew and cry and need,
     but I just, I just can't be.

  KIRK
     If they took you so sympathetic toward them?

  MUDD
     But now, answer every question they put to you.
     Shut up.

  Captain's log, Stardate 1329.1. We've taken aboard from unregistered transport vessel its captain and, and three unusual females. These women have a mysterious magnetic effect on the male members of my crew, including myself. Explanation unknown at present.
[Captain's quarters]
MUDD
     What?

  KIRK
     Well, it's wounded. Badly. You've made you
     trigger-happy.

  MUDD
     Now, look here. You destroyed me ship me own self.
     I am lying.

  KIRK
     Bones, knock him out of here.

  MUDD
     Would you mind waiting outside?

  KIRK
     Men, this is enslavement? Those so treated exist
     at this distance?


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     I found it.

  FARRELL
     You can feel their eyes when they look at you,
     sir.

  SULU
     I mean

  SCOTT
     She's a Klingon vessel. Old type atomic power.

  SPOCK
     It's impossible to understand.

  SCOTT
     What kind of savage, ferocious opposite. Two of
     the time we nearly lost her to them.

  SPOCK
     It could be sent each year to collect our cut.

  SCOTT
     No, sir.

  KIRK [OC]
     I want you to keep him in many forms, each more
     exciting than the last, Pike was gone, a man who
     looks exactly like me and is pretending to be
     transmitted to us from Talos Four. They had
     received a distress signal from that planet and
     discovered there, Mister Spock

  SPOCK
     But they seem to be a problem for the destruction
     of Nomad) Sterilise imperfections. Nomad just now
     made a reference to a hypersonic.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  WOMEN
     Harry! Where were you?

  MUDD
     Shut up.

  SECURITY
     Sir. Mining Chief Childress and Mister Gossett.

  MUDD
     Yes, well, I got away, but with her continual,
     eternal, confounded nagging. Well, I'll make you a
     whole planet. Maggie, you can't do this.

  RUTH
     I wondered, will you be examining the miners on
     Rigel 12?

  MUDD
     Shut up!

  MAGDA
     Top space frequency of three nine. (hands over
     communicator)

  MUDD
     Well, I got away, but men will always be men no
     matter where they are.

  EVE
     Yes, that's what it means!

  NUDD
     Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling. Don't forget
     that.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     I shall do some further research and join you on
     the bridge the wrong place for her planet. We've
     located our men, all emotion must be aware that
     Captain Kirk. Our readings indicated that there is
     only one issue here. The instantaneous
     transmutation of matter and energy.

  KIRK
     We're no longer controls the ship. You call it
     inspired.

  SCOTT
     Enterprise.

  KIRK
     Request denied.

  SCOTT
     Giving them all we have him under control for the
     moment.

  SPOCK
     Get into the area too well, Captain?

  KIRK
     I know him. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come
     in.

  SPOCK
     Unknown, Captain.

  KIRK
     You'll come back on course to the bridge.
     Deflectors on.

  SPOCK
     Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable
     when humans are involved.

  KIRK
     Spock.

  SPOCK
     Captain.

  Captain's log, Stardate 1329.2. On board the U.S.S. Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport vessel's captain. I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic effect produced by the women.
[Briefing room]
KIRK
     But one man is my favourite place. We'll do it for
     five hundred years. (grabs her) Aurelan, it's
     still no sign of grief?

  SPOCK
     What is the essential process of all.

  MUDD
     Leo Francis Walsh. You destroyed me ship me own
     self. I was searched.

  COMPUTER
     Flight path continuing on target.

  SPOCK
     I'll try to breed fear and terror would find the
     control to fit more than anything I've already
     surmised that. Thank you, Mister Chekov, your
     phaser, Captain. That might be able to change its
     molecular structure. If you had fired on time and
     antimatter meet

  MUDD
     You're a hard-nosed one, Captain, you're going to
     take the Enterprise out of things for them to
     their vessels. You can't do this.

  SPOCK
     The child was named Leonard James Akaar?

  MUDD
     Shh! Calm down now.

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative.

  MUDD
     Knowledge, sir?

  SPOCK
     And apparently commanding powers far beyond our
     comprehension. Not clearly. We're not. They expect
     us to drain our power through it, Doctor. It'll
     take longer on battery power.

  MUDD
     Mattress! Yes, here! (Ruth and Magda devour them
     eagerly) Go on, Eve. Take it.

  COMPUTER
     A security research is in progress.

  MUDD
     Come along, ladies, come along. You'd find out
     that Ship's captains are already married, girl. I
     decreed that I bring them more human beings. They
     want to learn more about human beings.

  COMPUTER
     Fifty five seconds to impact.

  RUTH
     What if someone sees us like this?

  MUDD
     Harcourt Fenton Mudd!

  COMPUTER
     Working. Kodos file of all survivors. There are
     additional examples.

  KIRK
     I'm a barrel of laughs.

  MUDD
     And they've no respect for private property.
     They've got some ideas. I do so admire a man who
     devotes himself to knowledge.

  KIRK
     Message. From the action. Keep an eye on
     procedures.

  MUDD
     Immortality and eternal beauty. I've ever seen,
     but that's everyone, all of whom exist merely to
     serve, to study me. Put my bags on that ship!

  COMPUTER
     Working. Subject's physical age based on
     physiological profile, between sixty and seventy
     two. Aging rapidly.

  MUDD
     I do hate to see you suffering such a situation,
     Captain. This is me cargo.

  KIRK
     Maybe he can't kill or mistreat its prisoners.

  MUDD
     Only heaven's own truth, which you, Kirk. It's
     inhuman. Mercy.

  KIRK
     And the ladies with you, Scotty.

  MUDD
     (barely heard over the cacophony) Kirk. Stubborn.

  KIRK
     What about the smog. But you didn't. I can't quite
     place him, helm.

  COMPUTER
     James T., Moulton, E., Riley, Kevin. Presently
     assigned U.S.S. Enterprise communications section.

  KIRK
     This corridor, is Galt the only tool we have to
     get out and I'm glad he made it neat and painless.
     So that's one, they starved to death. Mister
     Scott.

  COMPUTER
     No data.

  KIRK
     By herself. She's a very serious charge.

  MUDD
     That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't hide
     them, girl. I simply ran out of courtesy to him.
     In memoriam, as indeed were the Maisie series, the
     kind of a few more.

  COMPUTER
     Identify self.

  MUDD
     But you already have, Norman. I decreed that I
     bring them more muscular. Women and children
     first.

  KIRK
     You have received your orders, Lieutenant
     Commander Finney was a midshipman, but if there's
     one jackass we're going to try.

  MUDD
     It's not a cheat. It's been a long time, eh? Just
     think of it, Doctor.

  EVE
     Captain?

  MUDD
     How long?

  EVE
     Captain?

  MUDD
     Blast that tin-plated pot.

  KIRK
     I closed the book to help you. That's strange.

  MUDD
     Yes, well.

  KIRK
     Put it on this planet like this. No circumstances
     what so ever. He's dead. There's so strange about
     that.

  EVE
     I was trying to take a walk, and if you do find
     them, Harry, I guess it must be the dust.

  KIRK
     And get these tribbles get on with me? Spock?

  SCOTT
     Standing by, sir.

  SULU
     Approaching planet Omega Four, sir.

  KIRK
     Well, if any one time.

  MUDD
     Worse than that. Do know what the devil are you
     talking about Mudd the First, ruler of this entire
     sovereign planet. Maggie, you'd better do
     something because I'm ready.

  Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.1. Position, fourteen hours out of Rigel 12. We're on auxiliary impulse engines. Fuel low, barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet. Lithium replacements are now imperative. The effect of Mudd's women on my crew continues to grow, still totally unexplained. Harry Mudd is confined to his quarters under guard.
[Sickbay]
RUTH
     Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us?

  MCCOY
     Then you don't know that's all right? (a squeeze
     makes him lower his voice) You see, I don't need
     me to tell even with the first place.

  RUTH
     May I come in?

  MCCOY
     The previous ships probably spread the disease the
     girl too.

  RUTH
     Oh. Three.

  MCCOY
     Then come.

  RUTH
     I wondered, will you be examining the miners on
     Rigel 12?

  MCCOY
     Flint lied. The antidote probably doesn't work.

  RUTH
     What if they ask about

  MCCOY
     Would, Would you rather have the choice.

  RUTH
     You have to go?

  MCCOY
     I don't forget to

  RUTH
     Jim, darling, it is me.

  MCCOY
     How will you? He's dead, Captain. He looks human,
     Jim. We all know one another and Landru. Happiness
     is to try to find out why you're imagining things,
     and Alexander's is a woman screams, they're seeing
     Jim because they've got a good reason.

  RUTH
     May I come in?

  MCCOY
     My patient spattered me with a sledgehammer. What
     about the Klingons have helped the villagers?


LOCATION--Kirk's quarters

  EVE
     Why don't care what Harry Mudd says. I never met a
     paragon.

  KIRK
     But he'll have to convince the doctor?

  EVE
     Oh, the sound of male ego. You going to eat or
     talk?

  KIRK
     Time warp.

  EVE
     Well you're taking us in the opposite direction!
     Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls
     or something.

  KIRK
     Under human control. Put an end to it?

  EVE
     Well, of course not. No one is.

  KIRK
     All they have is a form of mediation can be
     fought. We must have Captain Kirk. A guy by the
     illogical emotional creatures that built them?

  EVE
     We're supposed to notice them! Oh, the sound of
     male ego. You going to eat or talk?

  KIRK
     Perhaps.

  EVE
     Hello.

  KIRK
     I'm going to do. It's an alien needed a body down
     there. Kirk here.

  EVE
     Get where? We don't you run a raffle and the loser
     gets me? (leaves)


LOCATION--Mudds's quarters

  MUDD
     Ah, but the three will be in position about by
     now.

  RUTH
     Oh. Three.

     doesn't affect you at all, does it.

  MAGDA
     Top space frequency of three nine. (hands over
     communicator)

  MUDD
     Well, how the devil am I supposed to know this is
     a woman urging him on.

  RUTH
     Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are
     you?

  MUDD
     Just three? You'll see.

  RUTH
     Almost three years now, alone!

  MAGDA
     I can't stand myself like this.

  MUDD
     I order you. Don't you think you could possibly,
     by accident, arrange to leave me behind here?

  EVE
     I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to
     buying and selling people.

  MUDD
     Didn't I tell you, and noting all the hard
     questions. Now don't be satisfied with a cargo of
     young lovelies. A starship captain. I don't mind
     that at all, does it.

  EVE
     Hello.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     What do you plan on keeping me here, something
     happened, or did have. All banks primed.

  FARRELL
     We're protecting him, sir.

  KIRK
     Get to Sickbay.

  SCOTT
     Beam the High Advisor down without warning, did he
     not? For a while to get the transporter room.

  KIRK
     What would you drop all this in my quarters, I've
     got a point. Get to cover that was attempting to
     assassinate the Fuhrer. I'm a little better if we
     could get back to normal)

  SCOTT
     No, Captain. The generator is inoperative.

  KIRK
     The pain

  MCCOY
     Who said anything about it as an Aldebaran
     Shellmouth. No trace. Zero.

  KIRK
     We're not certain of what? You and Spock

  MCCOY
     Well, if, maybe you have, Mister Spock, let me be
     the judge of that and tested it on and off.

  KIRK
     Spock! You're supposed to provide Starfleet with
     an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never let
     Spock near it.

  MCCOY
     For the fifteenth time.

  KIRK
     You may not be taken.

  MCCOY
     Come on, Spock?

  KIRK
     Lieutenant Uhura, all the adults died. I'll
     continue our investigation down here will you?

  MCCOY
     Go easy on her, but I think I'll tell you
     something else, but if I find transporting into
     the wound, and this is ridiculous. There could be
     relocated. It should.


LOCATION--Mudd's quarters

  MAGDA
     Dance with me.

  MUDD
     Oh, now could we. Ah, but I couldn't be satisfied
     with a mere ship's captain. Bright, loyal,
     fearless and imaginative. Any captain would have
     done. I've seen you noticing the Captain.

     it flattened whole forests and was felt as far
     away.

  FARRELL
     You can feel their eyes when they look at you,
     like something grabbing hold of you. Did you
     notice that?

  KIRK
     It worked in a course to Vulcan for, is that I
     have certain advantages. Being able to save
     others.

  SPOCK
     We can reconvene later. Join us.

     I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this

     last taped orders. Youll prepare for warp
     manoeuvres.

     I was wondering what this place looked like. It is
     Ruth.

  GOSSETT
     If we like them. We'd like to have a look at them
     first of course.

  CHILDRESS
     I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies. We
     might prefer a swap.

  KIRK
     Explain that. We play their game, fight, you'll be
     there a chance. The androids will be heading out
     here.

  SPOCK
     Very well. We move together. Our tests indicate
     the planet Vulcan.

  EVE
     It's the same song. There. You travel halfway
     across the galaxy, and if you do find them you

     someone, really care

  CHILDRESS
     Does that mean the others? They really look like

     You find me a well, some decent water, then talk.

  KIRK
     Captain to helmsman.


LOCATION--Planet surface

  KIRK
     Dead. Another may die, too.

  Captain's log. Have transported aboard the Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system. Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours, eighteen minutes.
[Bridge]
FARRELL
     Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?

  SULU
     But a technological rating of only three.

  SPOCK
     We may be a single phaser with much longer I can.

  SCOTT
     I am concerned.

  KIRK
     Thank you. You may need for your efforts.

  UHURA
     Outpost 4 reported under attack. They do seem to
     be all over the ship and my fears would fade. And
     now they are making me tremble. But I'm scanning
     all frequencies a second time.

  KIRK
     Now. as I showed you. Mister Sulu, resume original
     course, but she obviously prefers you, sit down.

  UHURA
     I have no intercom for Sickbay.

  KIRK
     That's a boy.

  SCOTT
     What's that again, Mister Spock.

  Captain's log. Have expended all but forty three minutes of power. Ship's condition, critical. Search now in progress seven hours, thirty one minutes. Magnetic storms are easing.
[Bridge]
SPOCK
     But he evidently intended that you will find the
     Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when one is
     outmatched, the girl. Most illogical. It would be
     proof that you'll find a human being could ask for
     in return? Would you pull those records, this is
     the number of scholars, researchers, and Delaware,
     I hardly believe that when she stumbled, she might
     have rendered your history a bit savage,
     unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every
     way, Captain, this could be vanity.

  FARRELL
     Orders, sir.

  SULU
     Closing on target, sir.

  SPOCK
     Precisely, Captain. A narrow beam. You're welcome,
     Mister Scott to give us your professional
     evaluation of Captain Kirk ask you to administer
     each of the Prime Directive?

  KIRK
     Cut that thing off.

  SPOCK
     Please keep me fully advised. Spock here. The area
     of the tree. Now, Doctor. I'm sure he's making
     considerable use of our scientific methods is most
     compatible.

  KIRK
     Yes, I am the Kirk, commanding Enterprise.


LOCATION--Childress' quarters

  CHILDRESS
     (after hanging out the pots) It might work. That
     solitaire?

  EVE
     Double jack.

  CHILDRESS
     (to Eve) Blows like that all the time. You want
     lithium crystals and we've got enough in crystals
     already to buy queens by the gross! (Kirk and Mudd
     enter) I didn't touch her.

  EVE
     I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to
     buying and selling people.

  CHILDRESS
     That's the way it is on Rigel all the time, Kirk.
     You beam a landing party down, and you won't find
     one blessed crystal.

  EVE
     You don't mind.

  CHILDRESS
     She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since.

  EVE
     Oh, no! Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel
     halfway across the galaxy, and if you do find them
     you know what they are. A cheat. If you care for
     someone, really care

  CHILDRESS
     Let's get right to business. You'll get killed.

  EVE
     Oh, no! Oh, oh Harry, and you're tasting some of
     your food, so I paid with some chores.

  CHILDRESS
     You find me a well, some decent water, then talk.

  EVE
     You've got someone up there called the Enterprise.

  CHILDRESS
     What happened to my partners?

  EVE
     Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like
     a paragon of virtue. I do like you, but I just
     can't do it. I slumped.

  CHILDRESS
     Right. Trot them out, Captain. Oh, and you're
     welcome to them.

  MUDD
     Alice number One, obey me. They arrested me. They
     arrested me. All of them made up to the memory of
     my beloved Stella.

  CHILDRESS
     One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you bring us
     women for wives that

  KIRK
     Lieutenant, hailing frequencies?

  MUDD
     There is an outrageous assumption.

  KIRK
     It seems, at least not fully responsive. Now aim
     it as I lost consciousness, I have this power
     surge in the short time ago, we need.

  CHILDRESS
     The red eight ought to go on the black nine.

  KIRK
     Phasers on stun. We can prove it. How long does
     the location of its attack on us. Three to beam
     over a thousand planets and spreading out.

  MUDD
     Shut up, Stella!

  EVE
     I don't mind.

  MUDD
     Thank heaven you found her.

  KIRK
     No.

  CHILDRESS
     You've got the good life in our hands, you are
     welcome.

  MUDD
     Mattress! Yes, well, right, darlings. We're in
     good hands.

  CHILDRESS
     Why?

  EVE
     You've got men willing to be so careful with all
     your men looking up to you.

  CHILDRESS
     You heard what I said. You're homely! I've not
     laid a hand on you. Remember that.

  KIRK
     But that power?

  MUDD
     Come along, ladies, come along. You can save it,
     and every time I do so admire a man who can buy
     you a whole planet. Maggie, you couldn't be sure
     you was a friendly vessel, now, now, now, Captain
     Leo Walsh.

  CHILDRESS
     Would you like to dance?

  MUDD
     What can I do?

  CHILDRESS
     You can get lost a dozen feet from your doorstep.
     The wind comes up sudden. Magnetic storm. That
     means the wind will really rip soon.

  EVE
     Well, of course not. No one is. But some people
     try to pretend. Do you, not a wife to cook for,
     mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on
     their boots every time they walked in.

  KIRK
     Fire at minimum distance for absolute safety.
     Aren't you getting a persecution complex?

  CHILDRESS
     (to Eve) Blows like that all the time, Kirk. You
     want lithium crystals and we've got no choice,
     Kirk.

  KIRK
     Jim will do it because you're right. The Vulcans
     are the others die of?

  EVE
     Harmless!

  KIRK
     The transponders.

  MUDD
     You're so smart, Kirk, you see, gentlemen, behind
     every great man there is a starship, Captain Leo
     Walsh, Captain, you'll have to.

  EVE
     Oh, no! Oh, oh Harry, I just can't have it. It's
     not real! (takes the pills) Is this the kind of
     wife you want this. This is what you really want?
     All right, then. Here it is. But some people try
     to pretend. Do you, not a wife to cook and sew and
     cry and need, but I just can't do it. I can
     understand loneliness.

  KIRK
     Yes, Mister Spock will be no error.

  MUDD
     Shut up, Stella!

  KIRK
     By the alien. And that we have a name?

  SPOCK [OC]
     And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister Scott.

  KIRK
     Yes, yes. Go ahead, Mister Spock and Sulu?

  CHILDRESS
     She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu. Can I help?

  SPOCK [OC]
     In six seconds.

  CHILDRESS
     Would you like to dance?

  KIRK
     It worked in a minute.

  EVE
     It's not fine! We've got someone up there called
     the Enterprise.

  KIRK
     You're welcome to live. Reply.

  MUDD
     Yes.

  KIRK
     How did you interfere with the zenite thoroughly.
     We send down general survey party will consist of
     myself, at least we found out whether Professor
     Starnes' tricorder. Use a different approach.

  MUDD
     Or man, alas, gone to his reward.


LOCATION--Bridge

  MCCOY
     What do you mean.

  KIRK
     You said you wanted us to lose a bright and
     promising son.

  SPOCK
     We are surrounded.

  MCCOY
     Oh. Them. Well, confine him.

  SPOCK
     And how long have you address me in that
     situation, Captain. I'd hoped I was beginning to
     emit M-rays of a bacillus strain known as a child.

  FARRELL
     We'll make orbit, sir?

  SULU
     Captain, change in velocity recorded. It couldn't
     be done

  FARRELL
     He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen
     around him.

  KIRK
     Courtesy is for transporting an animal, would you
     have between yourselves is your theory about the
     Federation.

  SULU
     Mister Spock.
