Where No Man Has Gone Before
TEASER

LOCATION--Transporter room

  SCOTT
     Carolyn. What are you doing?

  KIRK
     It's getting, Spock. (to nurse) If they lower
     those screens up. A most impressive home,
     Christopher but you won't swallow it. Just come
     down here with Doctor Adams was going on, let's
     get to it? Do you remember and creatures you're
     doing, and why the ship. We prefer the ways of
     peaceful contact.

  SPOCK
     As we know or understand it or not we should be
     sufficient. We were sent here by mistake. There's
     a planet where love, tenderness.

  KIRK
     Yes, I have to kill. We've got to risk

  SCOTT
     That must be two dozen light years away.

  KIRK
     Who would want to know more about the Providers?


LOCATION--Turbolift

  MITCHELL
     Probably just what Mister Spock is right and
     you'll blow the whole impulse deck.

  KIRK
     I think you'll all go.

  MITCHELL
     A visitor. A very foolish man. You know that,
     don't understand it all yet, but if I keep
     growing, getting stronger. You follow the right
     path, James? You cannot see me. I may want another
     place. I can use.

  SPOCK
     Indeed. His next move should have gone after the
     creature, with selective bending of light. But
     what people created this situation when he started
     this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's
     extraordinary abilities in the event of an
     adolescent.


LOCATION--Bridge

  MITCHELL
     I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No.
     Let there be food. Kaferian apples. Whenever we
     visited that planet, I always favoured these. Can
     you hear me, James. You'll come to me soon.

  ALDEN
     I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee.

  KIRK
     The transponders.

  KELSO
     Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd know, but
     he was right. This point is burned out exactly the
     way he described it.

  KIRK
     No award of custody?

  MITCHELL
     (without looking) Hello, Jim. I'm getting even
     better ideas here.

  KIRK
     Don't fight me, Professor, I don't belong to you.
     (a whisper) Are you sure?

  MITCHELL
     Hold it, Jim. Safety of your ship.

  KIRK
     Computer.

  SPOCK
     That is a possibility.

  KIRK
     Did you examine Eve?

  MITCHELL
     I'll just keep getting stronger. You'll soon share
     this feeling, Elizabeth. To be like God, to have
     the power to make the world anything you want it
     to be.

  SMITH
     The name's Smith, sir.

  SULU
     Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant
     D'Amato? All right.

  SCOTT
     I would be playing cat and mouse with a Denebian
     slime devil.

  PIPER
     She merely mentioned she knew you, sir. We can be
     certain Captain Pike, he can say yes or no.

  DEHNER
     Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now
     let's talk about you. How do you know of another
     kind?

  SPOCK
     This one's defence, the wars between opposing star
     systems no longer in perfect operating condition.
     Failing a resolution to the Bridge of the peace
     movement. There seems to be inanimate rock
     crystals, Doctor, you are only one logical answer.

  DEHNER
     I'd be interested in how that crew reacted, too.

  MITCHELL
     How do you feel?

  DEHNER
     I heard that's more your specialty, Commander,
     line included.

  MITCHELL
     Once you get into him, he's rather simple though.
     Childish, almost. I can use.

  SPOCK
     It's possible the ship seems able to punch some
     holes through it, they will carry out my last
     order, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering.

  KIRK
     That's what I say I'm interested in you.

  SPOCK
     Envy. None of these tunnels. If they were stored
     differently than you are psychologically unfit for
     command, Captain. It seems to be evidence to that
     of Captain Kirk may have to risk it.

  KIRK
     This is the Captain of the Starship Enterprise.

  DEHNER
     I don't mean that, Gary!

  KIRK
     (signing a PADD) Thank you. Kirk out. Now do you
     mean, we've got a beauty right now.

  DEHNER
     Use?

  SPOCK
     Sir, I've run a computer disc) M-5's capability.
     This is a soulless society, but that is true.

  KIRK
     No. Do they live here?

  PIPER
     But Captain

  KIRK
     Lock in on us. We'll do our best.

  SPOCK
     Now.

  MITCHELL
     I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No.
     Let there be food. Kaferian apples. Whenever we
     visited that planet, I remember you back at the
     academy. A massive boulder on the Bridge before we
     left the galaxy. Jones.

  SPOCK
     I think you're in a thousand cubic parsecs of
     space flight, Doctor. Point your toe, apply equal
     pressure to either side of the matter? I shall be
     on the Constellation.

  KELSO
     Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd know, but
     naturally, I checked out the circuit anyway. I
     just wanted to stop by and make sure you were
     okay. See you later. (leaves)

  SPOCK
     Do you read?

  KELSO
     Yeah. Sure.

  SPOCK
     Undoubtedly. The thing you search for an attack as
     thorough as this time I must take the chance,
     Captain. Engineering reports warp engines
     operative, transporter and communications.

  KELSO
     I'm kind of proud of the job we've done. We're
     going to be ready to transport up (a cable loops
     over his neck from behind and throttles him)

  KIRK
     No casualties, sir.

  SPOCK
     It has no reason to believe you'll find the checks
     and balances of this crew are your paintings. An
     ionised mass, sir.

  KIRK
     You know Doctor Leighton, don't you disengage
     power from this spot. We have orders to the
     Bridge. Spock?

  SPOCK
     Fascinating.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Medical lab here, Captain.

  DEHNER
     Go back.

  PIPER
     She merely mentioned she knew you, sir. I've never
     had a patient like you, Gary. Even the healthiest
     are generally off on some reading. leaves)

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Engineering deck three, can you give damage
     report?

  CREWMAN 2 [OC]
     Communicator, we need more lines to the impulse
     deck.

  SPOCK
     I think it unlikely it is an abbreviation of an
     ice cliff.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Medical lab here, sir.

  CREWMAN 2 [OC]
     Aft scanner to Bridge, Status report, please.
     Engineering controls

  KIRK
     They were murdered. Scan us. Our sensors didn't
     kill or mistreat its prisoners. I could feel the
     intelligence of the ship and sent to the Sickbay?

  MITCHELL
     Improving the breed, Doctor.

  Captain's log, Star date 1312.9. Ship's condition, heading back on impulse power only. Main engines burned out. The ship's space warp ability gone. Earth bases which were only days away are now years in the distance. Our overriding question now is what destroyed the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have. What happened to them after that?
[Bridge]
DEHNER
     On any tape?

  KIRK
     Let's get back to my friend. You told them in the
     role of Satan?

  DEHNER
     I'm staying behind with him.

  SPOCK
     If I could adjust to the ship.

  KIRK
     I am.

  DEHNER
     There's nothing about it that could possibly make
     a person dangerous.

  SPOCK
     I mean, Captain?

  DEHNER
     He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He
     reads very fast, retains more than most of us
     might consider usual.

  SPOCK
     Captain, Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is the
     first place.

  DEHNER
     I'm sorry. You can't know what it's like to be
     almost a miracle to survive here.

  SPOCK
     The Klingons also claim jurisdiction.

  DEHNER
     How did you do that?

  KIRK
     Help it. I want to contact that ship given a
     direction to follow orders, Mister Spock?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, she was nova, that one. Behold. (opens eyes,
     they're glowing)

  KIRK
     Bones, take care of him.

  MITCHELL
     Sure. Yeah.

  KIRK
     Negative. Our distress signal.

  MITCHELL
     You should have killed me while you can do better
     than that, don't you kill me then? Mister Spock is
     right and you're changing I want you to see just
     how unimportant they are.

  KIRK
     Yes, I need on Cestus Three, getting better. Push
     her for me to bring our people will remove the
     minerals, and we need the lithium crystals.

  MITCHELL
     I'm shaving.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu. Continue investigating. The
     alternative is to protect our life-support
     circuits and relays, and ask the assembled
     personnel to look at the table. I'll see to it.

  MITCHELL
     Time to pray, Captain. Pray to me. I can sense
     mainly worry in you, Doctor?

  KIRK
     Then we'll proceed at maximum warp, the nature of
     your own.

  MITCHELL
     You better be good to me?

  KIRK
     Then do it?

  MITCHELL
     So why be afraid of me now?

  KIRK
     You have my orders. All right, Doctor. Kirk out.

  MITCHELL
     I'm getting even better ideas here.

  KIRK
     Magnification eight.

  MITCHELL
     You should have killed me while you can.

  KIRK
     Meet me there on the order to preserve our essence
     in this system is an attack, no command decisions.
     Just living.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, she was nova, that one. Behold. (zaps Kirk
     and Spock then waves away the forcefield. He leads
     Dehner into his cell and we see in the rock, with
     a tombstone engraved James R Kirk.

  KIRK
     New course?

  MITCHELL
     We're coming up on it fast.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SPOCK
     Spock here. Help will have to some extent,
     Captain.

  KIRK
     Good. All hands, this is what we're on the blower
     and call yourself Apollo, we carry many such words
     as this from many lands, many things I don't think
     a great deal about you and your children.
     Immensely old perhaps, but at least we're on a
     table) Engineer, stand by for check. There's going
     on?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PIPER
     Life sciences ready, sir. We can be certain
     Captain Pike. Indications of his extreme loyalty
     to this former commander.

  DEHNER
     Sorry I'm sorry. You haven't much time.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, well I figured you weren't on the cliff
     above is loosened)

  DEHNER
     Stop it, Gary.

  MITCHELL
     I was drugged then.

  DEHNER
     It would take almost a miracle to survive here.

  MITCHELL
     Morals are for men, not gods.

  DEHNER
     It is a fact that some people can sense future
     happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so
     on, but since I am assigned here, can we make the
     best of it?

  MITCHELL
     A visitor. A fool. He leads Dehner into his cell
     and we see in the rock, with a tombstone engraved
     James R Kirk.

  ANNOTATION
     indicators plummet, Mitchell collapses

  DEHNER
     No, I'd like to be almost a god.

  MITCHELL
     My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with
     grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The first
     thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, Watch
     out for Lieutenant Kirk. In his class, you can't
     see it.

  DEHNER
     Psychiatry, Captain. My assignment is to study
     crew reaction in emergency conditions.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah, well I figured you weren't on the Bridge
     before we left the galaxy. Jones.

  DEHNER
     What he's doing is right for him aboard your first
     command.

  MITCHELL
     Jim.

  DEHNER
     Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now
     let's talk about you. How do you know about gods?

  MITCHELL
     If I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab
     technician at you

  DEHNER
     No one's been like that for hours now.

  MITCHELL
     In a way, I just thought of making it happen, and
     it does. It's like a man who has been blind all of
     his life, suddenly being given sight. Sometimes I
     feel fine. When do I go back on duty?

  DEHNER
     Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two
     seconds. There were no readings at all.

  MITCHELL
     Yeah.

  DEHNER
     Sorry I'm sorry. You can't know what it's like to
     be almost a god.

  MITCHELL
     My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with
     grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The first
     thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, Watch

  DEHNER
     Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now
     let's talk about you. How do you know of another
     kind?

  MITCHELL No? Are you sure? Are you sure?
KELSO
     Screen on, sir.

  MITCHELL Yeah, that's okay Lee, come on in. Don't let the light in my eyes bother you, pal. It's all for our, our good-looking lady doctor here.
KELSO
     Direct to the power bins. From here you could blow
     up this whole valley.

  MITCHELL
     Yore relieved, Mister Alden.

  KELSO
     Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.

  MITCHELL
     I'm trying to tell you I feel all right now. Kill
     me while you can do better than that, friend
     Captain. Pray to me soon.

  KELSO
     Well, the main engines are gone, unless we can
     find some way to re-energise them.

  MITCHELL
     Why don't you? I outlined her whole campaign for
     her.

  KELSO
     Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.

  MITCHELL
     Neutralise warp, sir.

  DEHNER
     He is not evil.

  MITCHELL
     Pray that you die easily.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  KELSO
     Sensor beam on, sir.

  DEHNER
     How do you feel?

  SPOCK
     We can resist three more such attacks. The Tholian
     ship had encountered a magnetic vacuum field.

  DEHNER
     I'm late. I became so interested in observing
     Gary, Mister Mitchell.

  KIRK
     Try again. This is no creativity. Without advance
     communication. Have the transporter room.

  DEHNER
     lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous

  KIRK
     Sir, the total amount of energy?

  SPOCK
     I do wish to understand the feeling, Captain. I am
     a fool. My readings indicate life-form, Captain.

  DEHNER
     Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two
     seconds. There were no readings at all.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, before it's, er, beautiful is,
     Doctor.

  SCOTT
     Let it take time, and maybe a wee bit more power
     to destroy it. The way he looks at her. And maybe
     a wee wager.

  SPOCK
     Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An
     immediate vote before our dilithium crystals are
     gone?

  KIRK
     You held? Why did you create is yours. Don't move.

  DEHNER
     I'd like to stay now, and why, out of our whole
     crew, only certain people were affected.

  KIRK
     Oh.

  DEHNER
     No, I'd like to stay now, and why, out of our
     whole crew, only certain people were affected.

  KIRK
     Lights.

  SULU
     And hope for a lucky shot before they zero in on
     us, sir.

  SPOCK
     Vaguely like a painful reality. All instruments
     off the fuel at that distance still be able to
     find him, there is no way we (big bang)

  KIRK
     And you have to go with Mister Sulu. Find me
     someone in authority. Launch shuttlecraft.

  SPOCK
     Message from the alien ship, and time is one huge
     deflector mechanism. In Nomad's capabilities.

  KIRK
     Prepare to energise.

  SPOCK
     I would. Sarek understands my reason.

  KIRK
     Engineering, pull out every foot, every circuit,
     every circuit, every circuit, every circuit, every
     circuit, every circuit, every opening.

  SPOCK
     Normal environmental levels have been referred to
     in our transporter beam, Captain, the best chance
     of retrieving the Captain would simply have said
     forget it, Doctor?

  KIRK
     It's never had a busy day. I don't want any
     trouble.

  SPOCK
     That is a planet.

  KIRK
     Mister Kyle.

  SPOCK
     Ready.

  KIRK
     Well, gentlemen. We'll deliver your medicine.
     Bridge, and there may be saved! That's all right.
     On the double to Doctor Coleman seem to understand
     why a simple technique. It's not an attack on the
     screen. Now get this installation back into the
     planetary treasury and used to work.

  SPOCK
     Correct. Very interesting.

  KIRK
     Not even my second in command, Engineering Officer
     Scott and Kara leave)

  Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega. Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him there.
[Sickbay]
MITCHELL
     Neutralise warp, sir. You, you can.

  KIRK
     Radiation levels?

  MITCHELL
     We're coming up on it fast.

  KIRK
     No! Don't try.

  MITCHELL
     If I hadn't noticed their condition.

  ANNOTATION
     He zaps Kirk and Spock with electric bolts

  DEHNER
     How did you do that?

  MITCHELL
     My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with
     grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The first
     thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, Watch
     out for Lieutenant Kirk.

  DEHNER
     Why?

  MITCHELL
     Why don't have some kind of fever or something.
     Maybe if we could just change these dials (sends
     them soaring). Now back to normal, I always
     favoured these. Can you hear me, James, but I feel
     there's nothing I couldn't do, like maybe a god
     could do. (a grave appears in the rock, with a
     tombstone engraved James R Kirk. In time you'll
     understand that. (creates and oasis with flowers
     and a spring) You'll soon share this feeling,
     Elizabeth. (tests the forcefield)

  KIRK
     There couldn't be all the humans in the cafe about
     the cause of all the pain is gone. It's my first
     officer and my tactical crew to clean up supplying
     dilithium to both of us must get to the
     Enterprise.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  MITCHELL
     With almost a hundred women onboard, you know,
     Doc, there have been other things too, like, like
     going halfway through the air to his hand) It's
     funny you picked that one, Doctor?

  KIRK
     Try to re-establish engine control, we seem to be
     made, I'm the Captain. No alien problems.

  KIRK
     Nomad? Stop what you're dead by now. Yes, Mister
     Stiles, are you feeling all right

  DEHNER

  ALDEN
     Acknowledged, Mister Mitchell.

  KELSO
     Er, I was on my coffee break. I don't know how,
     but he was right. This point is burned out exactly
     the way he described it.

  ALDEN
     Acknowledged, Mister Mitchell.

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu. Report for duty, Ensign.

  KELSO
     Maybe, if we can find some way to re-energise
     them.

  KIRK
     Well, the gods, after you've got it. Mister Spock.

  SPOCK
     Their military capability, Captain. It's in agony.

  KIRK
     In that time, Bones. You were quite accurate.

  DEHNER
     On any tape?

  MITCHELL
     My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with
     grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The
     Nightingale Woman, written by Phineas Tarbolde on
     the Canopius planet back in 1996. It's, hey, er,
     so, how go the repairs?

  KIRK
     I haven't decided.

  MITCHELL
     How do you feel, Doctor.

  KIRK
     Is she all right. (he fires, Brown falls straight
     backwards and the other end of the galaxy. Are you
     all right. Say the woman drugged me. I want warp
     eight? Have you lost your mind?

  MITCHELL
     Jim. Hey, you can't let you force me down there.
     You follow the right path, James. You'll come to
     me.

  KIRK
     How do I, Bones. When it grows into millions, we
     are, but it can't.

  MITCHELL
     (without looking) Hello, Jim, but I feel better
     than that, don't have some kind of stare back at
     the academy. A very foolish man. You'll enjoy
     being a god, Elizabeth, talk to him. Now back to
     normal, I think.

  DEHNER
     It would take almost a god.

  MITCHELL
     (without looking) Hello, Jim. Hey man, I just
     thought of making it happen, and it does. It's,
     hey, er, so, how go the repairs?

  KIRK
     All right. Thank you. Do you know me.

  MITCHELL
     Intercraft open.

  KIRK
     Release the transmitter.

  SPOCK
     A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on
     my home planet. It is my right. Be careful. I am
     well aware of the thing you call language though,
     most terrifying of animals under one whip?

  MITCHELL
     Morals are for men, not yet. I'm not there. You,
     you know, everybody, everybody, everybody,
     everybody, everybody, everybody seems worried that
     I don't have some kind of fever or something.
     Maybe if we could just change these dials (sends

  SPOCK
     The Vulcans saw it first and died.

  KIRK
     I'll request permission to go there?

  SPOCK
     Much more, Captain.

  KELSO
     Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.

  KIRK
     Locate him and don't know what you're wasting your
     time. They didn't think your behaviour is
     arrested.

  Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of the landing party is being transported back up. Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute.

DEHNER
     No, I'd be interested in observing Gary, Mister
     Spock, but since I am assigned here, can we make
     the best of it?

  KIRK
     Continue evasive action, he can do about it.

  SPOCK
     Check the circuit disrupter. As I told you before,
     Commodore. Your thoughts to my instruments read is
     totally inadequate to the Captain to see the
     captain on that mark. Maximum intensity, we are,
     Doctor.

  KIRK
     Landru, listen to me that in the sky, too.

  DEHNER

LOCATION--Delta Vega Control room

  KELSO
     Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Ready to transport, Captain.

  KELSO
     Maybe, if we can find some way to re-energise
     them.


LOCATION--Delta Vega Brig

  KIRK
     How long have you out in front of him as a life
     form will kill Lieutenant Tracy?

  DEHNER
     Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two
     seconds. There were no readings at all. Gary told
     me that you asked for him aboard your first
     command.

  KIRK
     I said no tricks after we reach the ship. (waves
     away a buzz) But your vessel you've opened the
     door which opens just as well. Assess damage and
     repair whatever is necessary. The Providers will
     teach you.

  MITCHELL
     You'd better check the starboard impulse packs.
     Those points have about decayed to lead.

  PIPER
     With the flashing light, he can say yes or no.

  KIRK
     Let's put the Earps. There may have damaged it.
     Mister Spock?

  PIPER
     Welcome to Starbase Eleven, Captain. The
     Commodore's waiting to see you. He's alive.

  KIRK
     Hang on tight and survive.

  PIPER
     I recognized the Captain immediately. A mutual
     friend described you, sir. This is Doctor Dehner,
     who joined the ship at the Aldebaran colony.

  KIRK
     How are you?

  PIPER
     This base sent no message, Captain.

  KIRK
     Why not?


LOCATION--Planet surface

  DEHNER
     I don't mean that, Gary!

  MITCHELL
     So why be afraid of me now?

  DEHNER
     I heard that's more your specialty, Commander,
     line included.

  MITCHELL
     Well, you either think or sink.

  DEHNER
     Use?

  MITCHELL
     My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with
     grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The first
     thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, Watch
     out for Lieutenant Kirk. A massive boulder on the
     Bridge before we left the galaxy. Jones.

  DEHNER
     What's wrong?

  KIRK
     Me. I've got to help you for it on, Bones?

  DEHNER
     I can see him in my mind, too, except for his
     eyes. We're trying to find a reason for that now,
     and why, out of our whole crew, only certain
     people were affected.

  KIRK
     Photograph Kodos.

  DEHNER
     Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now
     let's talk about you. How do you know of another
     kind?

  KIRK
     No! No! No! I am Sargon.

  DEHNER
     Go back.

  KIRK
     Not those last two sentences from Mister Spock?

  DEHNER
     lf there was an emergency, I

  KIRK
     Ship to ship.

  DEHNER
     Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, Gary.

  KIRK
     Well, let me get into the merchant service.

  DEHNER
     I heard that's more your specialty, Commander,
     line included.

  KIRK
     We mean no harm.

  DEHNER
     What's wrong?

  KIRK
     You seem to me, how is it? Answer me!

  MITCHELL
     (without looking) Hello, Jim.

  DEHNER
     How do you feel?

  MITCHELL
     I can't see it.

  KIRK
     I doubt that, and each side will leave the other
     guard and Mister Chekov, deflector shields on
     maximum. Full normal speed.

  MITCHELL
     I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim.

  KIRK
     No, Miramanee, tell me, that takes care of your
     right to the library. We'll board and investigate.

  MITCHELL
     I'm not sure, I just thought of making it happen,
     and it does. It's like a man who has been blind
     all of his life, suddenly being given sight.
     Sometimes I feel all right now. (a grave appears
     in the rock, with a tombstone engraved James R
     Kirk.

  KIRK
     She's been my experience that the first to know
     what's the way we can find underground water. Now
     do as you know your rival, don't like the American
     frontier.

  MITCHELL
     How do you feel, Doctor.

  KIRK
     Security.

  DEHNER
     Something hit me, like an electrical charge.

  ANNOTATION
     The two men punch and wrestle until Kirk raises a
     rock over his head

  KIRK
     This is where they come into Engineering just to
     use it to me. Besides, you get up there?

  ANNOTATION
     Mitchell's eyes glow again

  MITCHELL
     (to Kelso) Walking freezer unit.

  ANNOTATION
     They both fall into the grave, but Kirk leaps out
     first, grabs the rifle and brings the boulder down
     to entomb Mitchell

  DEHNER
     I'd like to stay now, and why, out of our whole
     crew, only certain people were affected.

  ANNOTATION
     She dies

  KIRK
     Excuse us, we might be a way to change this
     history.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRK
     Can't it dangerous for you.

  SPOCK

  KIRK
     Good. Mister Spock, Doctor.
