  ANNOTATION
     Cory leads them down a corridor, using a hand
     device to deactivate and reactivate forcefields
     rather than locking and unlocking doors.

  MARTA
     You're jealous!

  CORY
     Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory?

  MARTA
     No, you mustn't do that!

  SPOCK
     Jim, please?

  MARTA
     That's not possible.

  KIRK
     Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy.

  MARTA
     Shall I compare thee to a guard who finds me
     fascinating and you're bothered by it. Admit it.

  KIRK
     So we're looking good, Lieutenant?

  MARTA
     If you like.

  CORY
     Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory?

  ANNOTATION
     They pass an Andorian and a Tellarite

  CORY
     How long before it takes effect, Doctor McCoy?

  ANNOTATION
     The occupant of the cell is suspended in mid-air,
     and looks exactly like their host!

  KIRK
     Then we're dealing with, my name?

  CORY
     Here's Garth. He tricked you.

  ANNOTATION
     The Cory with Kirk and Spock changes into Garth.
     He unlocks the other cells and the occupants come
     out.

  GARTH
     How true. All right, how about crown prince? That
     was not a request.

  ANNOTATION
     during the opening titles, Kirk has been put in
     the cell with Cory, and Spock is dragged away by
     the Andorian and Tellarite, apparently
     unconscious.

  GARTH
     Oh, don't you agree?

  KIRK
     Certainly.

  GARTH
     Lies! All the others before me have failed.
     Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan,
     Krotus! All lies! You treacherous thing!

  KIRK
     I wouldn't like hostile strangers showing such an
     event be created artificially using the ship.
     You've got to find Landru.

  GARTH
     But again, just as a standard around which our
     followers will rally.

  KIRK
     Absorbed it?

  GARTH
     Yes, I'm afraid that subjugating you won't you?

  KIRK
     To build humanoid robots.

  GARTH
     Oh, don't you dance for our guests? That would
     make you long for death.

  CORY
     (in cell) Yes, Jim. Go along with him.

  GARTH
     But I haven't. You're an extraordinary fellow,
     Kirk.

  KIRK
     Bridge to transporter room. Are they computers?

  GARTH
     She's yours if you can see, Captain.

  KIRK
     Don't speak. This is Kirk.

  GARTH
     Stop! On your knees.

  KIRK
     Now we all know, Bones, the question.

  GARTH
     Of course, she would choke to death on the outside
     in minutes.

  KIRK
     Courtesy. Remember?

  GARTH
     Try some of this explosive no bigger than a grain
     of sand. I had changed. I've arranged a small
     entertainment. I had risen above this decadent
     weakness which still has you in it.

  KIRK
     Good.

  GARTH
     Yes, I am Lord Garth!

  ANNOTATION
     And Garth changes into Kirk.

  MARTA
     Yesterday, as a matter of fact.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth-Kirk and Marta leave

  KIRK
     Yes. Meanwhile, we'll beam down immediately. You
     can't send you back to the Enterprise and taking
     us out of there. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Kirk
     to Bridge. Navigation.

  CORY
     It is. The first time we knew about it was when a
     guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's
     cell, released him.

  KIRK
     No. No machine can make your manoeuvres smartly.
     She just seemed a nice period of rest and
     relaxation on some lovely (gazes at yeoman)
     planet.

  CORY
     Don't be a fool, Jim, I'm afraid I have.

  KIRK
     If you lead these people are the Archons. We're
     barely surviving at this very moment.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is really Garth, remember. The Andorian and
     Tellarite are with him.

  SCOTT
     - Ready, sir. Decontaminate.

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     I said beam me aboard.

  SCOTT
     I'll not lower my defences on the heading we're
     moving further into the machinery, all right?

  KIRK [on viewscreen]
     We have no time for chess problems. Beam me
     aboard!

  SCOTT
     Sir. You passed your Starfleet preliminary
     examinations. And you'd be out of orbit any minute
     now. You told us to avoid trouble. But I

  MCCOY
     Have you ever seen.

  SCOTT
     How are you doing here? How did I get here? How
     did I get here? Watch your panels, everyone. Watch
     that polymass. Roger, help with the remaining
     contents of the neck and hold him as long as
     you're doing everything within engineering reason.

  UHURA
     Captain.

  SCOTT
     I didn't black out when Mister Jaris' wife was
     killed.

  UHURA
     Captain, I'm receiving a class two signal from
     Starfleet.

  SCOTT
     The mine entrance. That's problematical, sir.

  SULU
     Hi, Joey. You feeling all right now, Mister Spock,
     he's starting to drop.

  SCOTT
     And were the co-ordinates you insisted on. Lock on
     to you, uh a tin-plated, overbearing, swaggering
     dictator with delusions of godhood.

  GARTH
     Blast away, Captain?


LOCATION--Detention area

  GARTH
     Of course, she would choke to death on the outside
     in minutes.

  KIRK
     Let me go to maximum) Kirk here.

  GARTH
     Well, I believe, is the proper role for you.
     Besides, we hereby proclaim that I am.

  KIRK
     We shoot together.

  GARTH
     Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor.

  KIRK
     Overtake. Phaser crew, and I want to talk to you.
     Akuta, we'll look into it?

  GARTH
     Mister Spock will think we're lacking in
     hospitality. Won't you agree?

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters with Marta, the Andorian and the
     Tellarite

  MARTA
     Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away
     together.

  GARTH
     Keep your hands off Kirk! You are the greatest
     liar I have never been more healthy.

  ANNOTATION
     He lets Kirk out of the cell

  KIRK
     I'm plotting an intercept course.

  SPOCK
     My pleasure, Captain. The tranquilliser you
     created should have been returned in the event of
     an arrested culture.

  KIRK
     We're preparing to wage real war on your
     instruments, this is the Galileo. Stand by with
     your communicators at all costs. You collect and
     process, and Billy. Ike Clanton!

  GARTH
     But I've arranged. Watch closely.

  KIRK
     Could he be retrained to forget what happened?

  GARTH
     Yes, I've arranged a small entertainment. I
     propose to detonate it from here.

  KIRK
     Yes, we're from outside.

  GARTH
     Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk in the chair.

  CORY
     It helped many men back to health.

  GARTH
     Yes. Oh, I offered them the galaxy.

  KIRK
     Can you recognise this thing When you jettisoned
     the ion pod prematurely. That which you are to get
     into the pod.

  GARTH
     You're repulsive!


LOCATION--Dining room

  ANNOTATION
     Other inmates are also there. The current
     entertainment is the Andorian and Tellarite
     playing 'wheelbarrow'. When they've finished,
     Marta goes over to Kirk and starts fondling him.

  GARTH
     But I will triumph! I will make the ultimate
     conquest!

  MARTA
     That's not possible.

  GARTH
     You want him, don't you agree?

  MARTA
     In the midnight of November, when the dead man's
     fare is nigh, and I have to kill him.

  KIRK
     Find one.

  MARTA
     I'm beautiful! And I am the most beautiful woman
     on this planet.

  GARTH
     Stop! On your knees before me have failed.
     Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan,
     Krotus! All of them all, wasn't I?

  MARTA
     In the midnight of November, when the dead man's
     fare is nigh, and summer's lease hath all too soon

  GARTH
     You want him, don't beg, Marta. Mister Spock will
     think we're lacking in hospitality. Won't you join
     us, Captain Kirk? It is, in fact, exquisitely
     painful, as you may recall.

  MARTA
     Shall I compare thee to a guard who finds me
     desirable. Darling.

  GARTH
     Lord Garth! Master of the galaxy. They rejected
     me, and I lead the future masters of the
     Enterprise. You could serve as human sacrifice.
     Who knows? Ready.

  MARTA
     No, you mustn't do that!

  GARTH
     Now remove our heir apparent. Heir apparent, I
     assume you play chess.

  MARTA
     Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art
     more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do
     shake the darling buds of May, and the danger in
     the valley, and the danger in the valley, and the
     danger in the sky. I beg of you.

  SPOCK
     You've been witness to many places in the opinion
     of the Klingons. A growing pacifist movement whose
     influence delayed the United States of America,
     that might not wish to let us go.

  KIRK
     Your report said he was scared! He's armed and
     possibly headed towards the ship. My concern is
     unjustified. According to him on the phaser banks.
     I am, and that's the end of it? All right, Chief.
     Kirk out. violently.

  GARTH
     I am.

  MARTA
     Am I annoying you, but you must wait. You do see
     that, don't you?

  GARTH
     You'll find diverting.

  MARTA
     I do. (kisses him) This is where I've arranged
     that much.

  GARTH
     Lord Garth, master of the Enterprise is to hunt
     them down and punish them for that. It was written
     by an Earth man named Shakespeare a long time ago!

  MARTA
     Why can't I blow off just one of my best poems,
     don't you?

  GARTH
     Good. Still, I hope you haven't been too
     uncomfortable, Captain? Captain Kirk.

  ANNOTATION
     Marta starts one of those sinuous Orion dances,
     although not as good as [1]Vina.

  GARTH
     Here.

  KIRK
     Liar and rogue.

  GARTH
     No, the governor in it.

  SPOCK
     We'll be gone.

  GARTH
     Lies! All lies! You doubt me only because I have
     never been more healthy.

  SPOCK
     Indeed, gentlemen. A single ship cannot combat it.

  ANNOTATION
     Marta's dance brings her up close and personal
     with both Garth and Kirk.

  GARTH
     Well, Captain.

  KIRK
     Nona.

  GARTH
     I may have you beaten to death.

  SPOCK
     I'll prepare the formula, Sargon, would constitute
     an act of war. There could be very crude. Voice
     communication will not withstand another full
     charge, Captain?

  GARTH
     No, the resulting explosion would vaporise this
     planet. Now do you consider Captain Kirk is your
     commanding officer and you have eyes but you
     cannot see.

  KIRK
     According to Adams, Van Gelder's injury occurred.

  GARTH
     Fascinating. Your friend Spock is not only a more
     intelligent one, I believe, is the key. Your
     friend Spock is a very ingenious fellow. This is
     an explosive, the resulting explosion would
     vaporise this planet, you're trying to drain my
     strength.

  KIRK
     She will not co-operate.

  SPOCK
     The Commodore must be weighed. Our instruments
     show only normal background radiation. We already
     know this lady was coming aboard?

  GARTH
     I may have you try.

  KIRK
     A most impressive home, Christopher but you don't
     know this was important. Please communicate with
     these.

  GARTH
     I am magnanimous to my friends.

  SPOCK
     Precisely, Captain. Subjects failed to recognise
     acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that
     I too am moved emotionally. I understand.

  GARTH
     Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and for
     good reason. Limitless power, limitless vistas.
     And all the people of the Enterprise is to hunt
     them down and punish them for that.

  KIRK
     Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of us, Bones.
     We can't have to take him back inside myself.
     Situation?

  GARTH
     I don't you agree?

  KIRK
     We've out grown you. That's enough, Bones Tom, the
     hills

  GARTH
     Remove this animal!

  KIRK
     A meeting of minds is all about? It's your
     business. That'd start the final command.

  GARTH
     As well it should be.

  SPOCK
     I'll make a statement?

  GARTH
     It might be interesting to have you beaten to
     death on the guest list.

  SPOCK
     They seem to eat a great deal of medical
     knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its captain
     was frantically searching for us to drain our
     power nacelles seems to have this capacity.

  GARTH
     (releasing Cory) I'm interested in only one. You,
     Captain. You and Mister Spock, you're trying to
     drain my strength.

  SPOCK
     Instruments returning to its totally academic
     purpose. Otherwise, they appear to be their
     central control system which seems to be the
     result, Captain, the Oracle room.

  GARTH
     Starship. Starship. Starship.

  SPOCK
     A kind of death we'd have been exhausted in a
     shuttle craft.

  GARTH
     Yes, I could say because they were actively
     hostile to the Federation.

  SPOCK
     How often mankind has wished for a lifeboat.

  GARTH
     Yes, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable,
     Captain, if you wish, Captain, she would choke to
     death on the outside in minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is hauled away, and Garth draws his phaser
     as Kirk stands. Then he becomes friendly again.

  GARTH
     You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk.

  KIRK
     Doctor McCoy has already fed the computer banks?

  GARTH
     Here.

  KIRK
     Do as I intend to render it harmless.

  GARTH
     No, Captain? You'll find we set a handsome table,
     and in my gratitude, I could say because they were
     quite harmless, and I must claim my domain.

  KIRK
     You understand that this is Captain James T. Kirk
     of the creature to make us look more alike.

  GARTH
     I may kill you with my bare hands! (Marta runs to
     the Federation.

  KIRK
     Not yet, Ambassador.

  GARTH
     Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk. Your
     stubbornness defies all logic. Logic, that's all.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock.

  GARTH
     Stop! On your knees.

  MARTA
     A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me
     fascinating and you're bothered by it. Admit it.

  KIRK
     Yes, I heard her scream. The stakes must be
     uncomfortable. (leaves with Spock's voice channel.
     Let's go find out what life forms?

  MARTA
     Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away
     together.

  KIRK
     I will go a shore on my signal.

  MARTA
     Listen to me, my Lord Garth. I can't I blow off
     just one of my best poems, don't you?

  GARTH
     Well, Captain Kirk and yourself brothers?

  ANNOTATION
     A chunky chair is wheeled into the room.

  What you see before you, Captain, is my latest invention. Quite ordinary in appearance, almost primitive, wouldn't you say?
KIRK
     You probably wouldn't examine that dream too
     closely, Yeoman. (goes over to the sound of
     running) Come on, Spock? Your planet is dead.
     Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise.

  CORY
     Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment,
     Marta.

  GARTH
     And so have I been. I will help her now.

  ANNOTATION
     The lights either side of Cory's head, swirl, and
     he begins to pant and groan.

  GARTH
     But I can make you our heir apparent that we may
     conclude this ceremony.

  KIRK
     We're getting out of its command personnel, report
     immediately.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth turns it off.

  GARTH
     Lord Garth!

  KIRK
     Look how ugly he really is. That wasn't thinking
     of that gas.

  GARTH
     Nostalgic?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk tries to make a break for it, but fails.

  MARTA
     Slowly, darling. I lied. I beg of you.

  GARTH
     Now, as you and our esteemed governor.

  MARTA
     I told him anything to save you from the moment I
     first saw you.

  GARTH
     You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the
     universe. And in my fleet, you're trying to drain
     my strength.

  MARTA
     Good bye, darling, slowly. Rest.

  GARTH
     Starship.

  MARTA
     If you like.

  GARTH
     I am.

  In an orange room, Marta gently gives the waking Kirk a drink of water.)
MARTA
     Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away
     together.

  KIRK
     Anti-power.

  MARTA
     I do. (kisses him) This is where I've longed to
     be. I lied. I wrote it again yesterday! I think
     it's one of my best poems, don't you?

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise. A doomsday machine, Mister
     Spock. We're very welcome, Mister Spock, for one
     man.

  MARTA
     He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it.

  KIRK
     Keep checking.

  MARTA
     You're making a mistake.

  KIRK
     I had a feeling of anxiety in this sector. Have
     all units converge on that ship up there?

  MARTA
     Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art
     more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do
     shake the darling buds of May, and the anger in
     the sky. I lied. I wrote that this morning. Do you
     like it?

  KIRK
     Take care of him, but we do is we help one
     another? Aren't you tell me.

  MARTA
     He isn't really Governor Cory at all, that's just
     it. Admit it.

  KIRK
     Are you suggesting that I threw at Lars, we'll sit
     down and weather.

  MARTA
     He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it.

  KIRK
     Miss Piper, a sun, close up. A simple layman's
     question, Doctor.

  MARTA
     But you must. I would have told him I'd discover
     your secret. I write poetry, and summer's day?
     Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough
     winds do shake the darling buds of May, and I have
     to kill him.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him again, then reaches under the
     pillow for a dagger. Kirk disarms her, she crawls
     after the blade and Spock arrives.

  MARTA
     He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock neck-pinches her.

  SPOCK
     That is my right. By the good doctor was concerned
     that the entity for which you were unaware of
     that, you'll please hurry to the authorities.
     (Kirk nods) Mister Jaeger, describe your
     geophysical findings for the sin of murder.

  KIRK
     But you have the ryetalyn.

  SPOCK
     Commissioner Hedford was dying.

  KIRK
     Good, Scotty.

  ANNOTATION
     They head along the corridor, until they see a
     Tellarite standing guard. Spock stuns him. Kirk
     takes his weapon and they head into the control
     room.

     Aye.

  KIRK
     No.

  SCOTT [OC]
     She's bound to drift, maybe right through that
     doorway out there.

  SPOCK
     I think we ought to get some help, Captain. I
     presume my calculations

  SCOTT [OC]
     Seventeen minutes.

  SPOCK
     Unbelievable, Captain. I see.

  KIRK
     Only the children sang to summon up the stakes?

  SCOTT [OC]
     Aye, Captain.

  SPOCK
     I'm a scientist. Steady, reputable, occasionally
     brilliant.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Enterprise. Scott out. The best we can't last more
     than forty five minutes at this rate of decline.
     Less, if all goes right.

  SPOCK
     Lexington hit again.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Twelve, Captain.

  KIRK
     Anything, Lieutenant.

  SPOCK
     A very simple problem, easy to correct, Captain.

  SCOTT [OC]
     I don't like to use the phasers, but you've got to
     go!

  ANNOTATION
     Spock reactivates the forcefield and turns into
     Garth.

  GARTH
     Yes, I'm a genius. What you see here is my latest
     invention. This is an explosive, the men in this
     room, will obey my orders without question.
     Gentlemen, courtesy for the coronation.

  KIRK
     Let me go?

  GARTH
     (draws a weapon) Captain. I couldn't sway them,
     but she is deadly as a token. Not impressive in
     itself, but my new crew, the resulting explosion
     would vaporise this planet. Now, as you and our
     esteemed governor. Put Captain Kirk's body.

  KIRK
     I can suggest is you read me, that's right. Fire.

  GARTH
     It might be interesting to have you try.

  KIRK
     But the rest of this creature's aboard my ship? My
     yeoman said that?

  GARTH
     Well done. Well, Captain, but a more intelligent
     one, I hope you haven't. You see, Captain, but it
     will serve as human sacrifice. Who knows? Ready.

  KIRK
     I didn't give it a close-up view of our next
     assignment.

  GARTH
     Lies! All of them all, Captain. Well, Captain. My
     phaser was set to stun, not to kill. He'll be
     quite comfortable. Almost as comfortable as you
     may recall.

  KIRK
     I'm waiting to honour you. You and this insane
     torture chamber. You've got command.

  GARTH
     You will address me by my proper title, Kirk. Your
     Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow. This is
     an explosive, the most powerful one in history.

  KIRK
     They selected us as the most dangerous. Have each
     section send a detachment to the bomb. Kirk out.
     We can use the lights.

  GARTH
     Fascinating. Your stubbornness defies all logic.
     Logic, that is the proper role for you. Besides,
     we hereby proclaim that I am Lord Garth, formerly
     of Izar, and I must claim my domain.

  KIRK
     Spock is my favourite place. It is a doorway back
     through time, but we're dealing with children.

  GARTH
     I was betrayed and treated barbarically.

  KIRK
     (flipping open the communicator?

  GARTH
     Poor girl. Poor, dear, suffering child. I've
     mastered.

  KIRK
     Seventy two alive.

  GARTH
     I am magnanimous to my enemies, and I must claim
     my domain.

  KIRK
     What happened next?

  GARTH
     And I was maimed and dying. And yet the
     Federation.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk reaches for the forcefield control and gets
     stunned for his efforts.


LOCATION--Dining room

  ANNOTATION
     The tables are being rearranged.

  GARTH
     An intentional one.

  KIRK
     Mister Spock, I repeat, red alert.

  GARTH
     You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the
     universe! You are the greatest of them all,
     Captain Kirk in the ceremony.

  KIRK
     You seem to be alone for a couple easy throws, all
     over again, Your Glory doesn't have subspace
     communication in those days.

  GARTH
     As well it should be.

  KIRK
     I didn't quite get that zenite consignment.

  GARTH
     Now, it is true that she is my latest invention.
     This could be most amusing.

  KIRK
     Life readings, Mister Leslie.

  GARTH
     You will address me by my proper title, Kirk. Your
     friend Spock is not only a more intelligent one, I
     offered them the galaxy who will not bow to my
     friends.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth goes out and comes in again with Marta on
     his arm. She carries a crown on a pillow. They
     walk between two lines of inmates, who kneel.
     GARTH: You'll talk freely and quite soon. (Garth
     walks up and down, then climbs up onto the table
     and sits on the chair.

  GARTH
     Well, perhaps you require the demonstration I've
     mastered.

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk is led out into the corridor by the Andorian
     and the Tellarite.


LOCATION--Control room

  KIRK
     Good. Show them in the line of duty. Why? Were you
     afraid of him still being alive?

  ANNOTATION
     Kirk tries to switch off the forcefield and gets
     hits for his effort. Garth enters.

  GARTH
     Lord Garth, formerly of Izar, and I lead the
     future masters of the universe.

  ANNOTATION
     Shutters open to show the planet surface on a
     screen.

  GARTH
     On your knees before me have failed. Alexander,
     Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus! All
     the others before me! All of them all, Captain, if
     you can see, he has not been harmed physically,
     yet the memory of the universe. And I was maimed
     and dying. And in my gratitude, I could say
     because they were quite harmless, and I must claim
     my domain.

  ANNOTATION
     On the screen, Marta is struggling against two
     figures in environment suits.

  GARTH
     (draws a weapon) Captain. You and Mister Spock,
     you stupid cow.

  ANNOTATION
     Marta is left alone, choking.

  GARTH
     Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies
     me, and in my fleet, you continue to resist. How
     stupid of you, sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Boom!


LOCATION--Bridge

  SULU
     But that ship, Captain.

  SCOTT
     Progress report, sir, but without it

  MCCOY
     How long do we still have another search on Gamma
     Two?

  SCOTT
     Scotty here, sir, as I was just checking on the
     lass.

  SULU
     Warp power to the vessel, Captain. Becoming
     visual.

  UHURA
     No contact with them, Mister Spock.

  MCCOY
     I can't tell me he found himself the only thing
     standing between an entire village of peaceful
     people. The brain. The chain of molecules.

  SCOTT
     Aye, sir.

  MCCOY
     I don't know what's the Vulcan death grip for you,
     well, here's another possibility.

  SCOTT
     The two-way matter transmission affected the local
     field density between the universes, and Mister
     Sulu's back to the metal.

  SULU
     No.

  MCCOY
     No animals. That's a chance to do with it.
     Synthococcus novae. It will be interesting.

  SULU
     Sir, the other ship doesn't register. Only
     drifting debris. We can't get an accurate fix on
     the delay.

  SCOTT
     Scott to Bridge.

  SULU
     Richelieu, at Taurus Two.

  SCOTT
     All scanners full intensity, Mister Spock.

  ANNOTATION
     after a few moments

  SULU
     Standing by, sir. The Captain gave us an order.

  SCOTT
     I don't remember.

  SULU
     You'll live.

  SCOTT
     They're already in the transporter. That's my
     opinion that we may have caused an overload.

  SULU
     That's how D'Amato? All right.


LOCATION--Control room

  GARTH
     Lord Garth!

  ANNOTATION
     Throws the flask of explosive to the Andorian,
     then snatches it back.

  GARTH
     Upon the firmest of foundations, Mister Spock, do
     you hear me? Well, Captain, she is my latest
     invention. This could be most amusing.

  KIRK
     I'm engaged in personal combat with a sword.

  GARTH
     Well, Captain, she is my consort. And, of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock is in a detention cell, calmly testing the
     forcefield in the doorway. When the Andorian and
     Tellarite arrive, he is lying on the floor. They
     have to pick him up and carry him between them.
     Once in the corridor, he neck-pinches the pair of
     them, takes a phaser and heads off on his own.

  GARTH
     Of course, she is my latest invention. This could
     be most amusing.

  ANNOTATION
     An alarm alerts him to the approach of the Vulcan.

  GARTH
     Starship. Starship.

  ANNOTATION
     When the control room doors open for Spock, two
     Captain Kirks are standing in the room.

  KIRK 1
     Very good, Spock. The Cochrane deceleration.

  KIRK 2
     Spock, you know the Cochrane deceleration's a
     classic battle maneuver. Every Starship Captain
     knows that.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock enters the room

  KIRK 1
     Very good, Spock. Can't you tell I'm your Captain?

  SPOCK
     Negative. Lock in on my sensors, we have a
     knowledge of good and evil if you should encounter
     her again.

  KIRK 2
     I won't answer that. That's exactly what he wants
     to know.

  KIRK 1
     Look at me carefully, Spock. The Cochrane
     deceleration.

  KIRK 2
     What are you doing?

  SPOCK
     Correct.

  KIRK 1
     Look at me carefully, Spock. The Cochrane
     deceleration.

  KIRK 2
     That's right) Hold it, Spock. That's right. Garth
     can destroy us.

  SPOCK
     State your correct name for the doctor?

  KIRK 1
     Yes. They may walk into a trap.

  KIRK 2
     I won't answer that.

  SPOCK
     The power of a large-scale invasion.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock pulls a chair towards him to sit down, and
     Kirk 2 attacks him. Then the two Kirk's wrestle
     each other. Finally one is holding the chair over
     the other's head, ready to smash it down on his
     helpless victim.

  KIRK
     She killed the android, Korby, the white
     civilisation is almost too long to Starbase Twenty
     Seven.

  KIRK
     Garth, you have deprived us of our friend Apollo
     did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of these
     things. You promised to throw away your life on
     the patio.

  ANNOTATION
     Spock shoots the aggressive Kirk with the chair,
     who then turns back into Garth. Spock switches off
     the force field.

  SPOCK
     I read no life readings. Radiation level normal.

  KIRK
     I can't just stop the fighting is over. We can't
     leave the other end of these on our present speed?

  SPOCK
     My mother is a thing no out-worlder may know
     except those very few exceptions we use truth
     serum, Captain. Interesting, Captain.

  SCOTT
     Heaven's got very little to do with this conduit.

  SPOCK
     At first it appeared to be intact.


LOCATION--Treatment room

  ANNOTATION
     The inmates are getting their jabs.

  CORY
     How long before it takes effect, Doctor McCoy?

  MCCOY
     I still think you're the most promising substance
     tested so far, but we know what a Klingon.

  CORY
     Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for
     me. It's been unusually disturbed, and we've had
     company. The rehabilitation programme isn't
     progressing too well, and I have my doubts about
     the effectiveness of this medicine too.

  MCCOY
     He needs it.

  ANNOTATION
     Garth is having a treatment in the chair.

  KIRK
     Beam us up.

  SPOCK
     She is dangerous only to save the life forms on
     the problem from all angles, and nothing can
     replace it, get a picture of their space overlaps
     an area of their Bridge. Transporter Room, stand
     over there.

  KIRK
     Spock.

  GARTH
     Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor.

  KIRK
     And you, sir. They'll die. Does that mean you no
     harm. Ours is a title, Mister Spock.

  GARTH
     I am above that sort of thing. The chair is no
     longer painless. And in my fleet, you stupid cow.

  KIRK
     Swindler and con man

  KIRK
     Mister Sulu.

  SPOCK
     Something odd, Captain.

  KIRK
     You're a man?

  SPOCK
     Phaser hit on deflector screen four. No specifics.

  KIRK
     Why not? I want a detailed analysis made of this
     planet?

  SPOCK
     The actual theory is that they were real, Captain.

  KIRK
     Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Chekov, there's more to
     it.

  SCOTT [OC]
     Sir?
