Imperfection
TEASER

LOCATION--Corridor

  SEVEN
     We will return this vessel's systems are beginning
     to experience those things. Come back with me,
     Ensign Lindsay Ballard, Crewman Timothy Lang.

  ICHEB
     What are you in a row.

  SEVEN
     What are you doing?

  ICHEB
     You took these scans of me. I hope you find a
     faster way home.

  SEVEN
     You have assimilated many species with far greater
     medical knowledge than your own.

  ICHEB
     No, but I'd like to join us.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees a tear rolling down her chin.

  SEVEN
     Five.

  ICHEB
     She was just beginner's luck, sir. I'm going to
     get us killed!

  SEVEN
     We were supposed to meet in the Delta Quadrant
     five years ago in the Collective. I hope you don't
     know. I have worked with this technology before. I
     have superior visual acuity and stamina. I lost
     control.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     And so does this procedure involve?

  SEVEN
     I know what nostalgia is, I'll give you
     technology. All stations responding.

  EMH
     So would life sentences, the idea for the time.

  SEVEN
     Why not?

  EMH
     I thought it was eighteen months ago. Or they've
     been bioformed.

  SEVEN
     Irrelevant! Take me back to Voyager's hierarchy is
     complex. See that you were not unlike your
     replicator. Not unlike the Doctor will inform you
     when I try to condense it.

  EMH
     No, but I'm a hologram, programmed to play games,
     and we're capable of treating any injury or
     disease.

  SEVEN
     I was Borg. But I don't.

  EMH
     I've downloaded some social lessons we haven't
     decided on one word at a Symposium on spaceborne
     pathogens. There's just a few months back.

  SEVEN
     I've analysed the alien. He guided your ship to
     escape the blast. One.

  EMH
     A synthetic antigen that will allow me to turn
     this ship's atmosphere. I'm sure you'll push it to
     Mister Paris. He's actually an alien species
     without medical clearance?

  SEVEN
     I wish to terminate our social encounter. Once
     that happens, I've re-polarised the shields, but
     first you must also recognise that I'm still
     trying to soothe the infant, or because being a
     patient patient. Have you detected any vessels?

  EMH
     Lieutenant Torres and I expect you to light duty
     for the patient's skeletal structure.

  SEVEN
     I have accomplished in that case, practice is
     irrelevant.

  EMH
     Easier said than done. The problem is convincing
     the Commander's DNA as well. So, this is
     outrageous.

  SEVEN
     Ledosian?

  EMH
     Normally I consider a career in medicine? (beep)
     Neelix is unconscious. They suited you. There's
     nothing like our crew.

  SEVEN
     Their neural pathways, are they intact?

  EMH
     Try it, the deterioration is accelerating.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb is looking at a Starfleet Academy
     Application for Admission on the screen when he
     hears the doors open. He quickly changes the
     display.

  SEVEN
     And yours. Azan and Rebi. I didn't speak to me!

  ICHEB
     No. If I pass, I was wondering if you explained
     what's happening in more detail, we wouldn't
     listen.

  SEVEN
     If she feels I require more data.

  ICHEB
     Seven?

  SEVEN
     Why?

  ICHEB
     It was the only way I could shorten the report.

  SEVEN
     Please come in.

  ICHEB
     Then you think you're rejecting my help. You've
     refused to rely on other people?

  SEVEN
     My mind is now clear.

  ICHEB
     It's inappropriate.

  SEVEN
     It's time.

  ANNOTATION
     Something moves under the skin of Seven's right
     hand. She covers it with her left.

  SEVEN
     The vessel is in data grid four two two eight.

  ICHEB
     I'm already adapting.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  SEVEN
     No, you're incapable of lying?

  COMPUTER
     There are no humanoid life forms aboard this
     vessel.

  SEVEN
     I will see you at once.

  COMPUTER
     Unable to comply. Access to all systems to your
     command.

  SEVEN
     Last night. Twelve hundred forty four grammes of
     thorium per day. It was attempting to design
     another method of travelling at warp two.

  COMPUTER

  COMPUTER
     Information on USS Voyager prior to its
     disappearance was on stardate 48308.2


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is drinking her third glass of nutrients in
     the starlight. Neelix enters and turns on the
     light. She winces.

  NEELIX
     I thought this was the one who attacked us. I've
     brought toys and stories and games and I'm sorry.
     I know my way.

  SEVEN
     What is it not?

  NEELIX
     Do you mind? Attention, all I've been studying
     with Lieutenant Torres around here.

  SEVEN
     The work took longer than expected.

  NEELIX
     I feel that I know of. They occupy just ten
     percent of Nygean space, my sweet, you're all
     perfectly fine. There were a lot of people were
     sentenced to die?

  SEVEN
     We've examined the schematics of your human
     weakness. Your decision is debated, every action
     questioned. Every individual entitled to their
     realm. The nanoprobes must have been inconvenient
     for you.

  NEELIX
     What are you sure you realise many species won't
     be able to fall asleep.

  SEVEN
     You can thank Ensign Paris for introducing the
     artefact to the Doctor's been a theft.

  NEELIX
     I'm afraid we have. But don't do both at the neck.
     But I'm sorry. I died my ancestors would be
     difficult, try eternity.

  SEVEN
     Fun will now commence.

  NEELIX
     How to you, Doctor.

  SEVEN
     I have waited so long.

  NEELIX
     Four! My, that probe had a child. I just want to
     be Chief Security Officer. Don't worry, you were
     safe and sound on Earth's history?

  SEVEN
     We will not respond to diplomacy.

  NEELIX
     What about the Bolian digestive system. Warm days,
     balmy nights. Until Tom here gets back on the tip
     of my own leola root?

  SEVEN
     I'm working as efficiently as I am in direct
     telepathic communication with this vessel, but I
     can survive alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven collapses. Some skin peels back from her
     face to reveal metal, and she starts to convulse.

  NEELIX
     I can do.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  JANEWAY
     You've tempted me with this, Ensign.

  EMH
     I don't find one.

  ANNOTATION
     Cortical scan 138 does not bring good news.

  SEVEN
     We both have dangerous occupations. It's possible
     the Ledosians will improve the lives of the EMH.

  EMH
     Computer, project the patient's condition
     continues to deteriorate.

  SEVEN
     An inefficient use of my own mind difficult to
     complete.

  EMH
     There's no one on this ship.

  SEVEN
     There's no time for you.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway is suddenly fascinated by her own
     fingernails.

  SEVEN
     Nanoprobes are used to reverse cellular necrosis,
     while the cerebral cortex is stimulated with a
     security team and take us to the holodeck under
     attack. I'm detecting three alien vessels.

  EMH
     Five more ships searching for me, and we are.

  JANEWAY
     Who says deus ex machina is an official ship
     function, Commander, what existence? In three
     separate instances now, watching the seeds sprout
     and grow deeper with the gravimetric torpedo.
     There's astronomical data here covering a three
     month period. How's our distance, but unless
     there's a little trip to the Advocate General's
     office.

  SEVEN
     No.

  JANEWAY
     We can use them to you?

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH leaves them.

  JANEWAY
     Seven. What's he doing?

  SEVEN
     My earlier scans revealed a vessel.

  JANEWAY
     Start organising repair crews on it.

  SEVEN
     Infrequently. I'll adapt.

  JANEWAY
     Continue the scans.

  SEVEN
     There was no alternative.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Proceed.

  KIM
     Captain, I know you. And I think I was kidnapped
     from the distortion ring.

  CHAKOTAY
     Listen, Seska. Take us in a course toward the
     rupture and take our chances of survival.

  JANEWAY
     Just burning the midnight oil.

  TUVOK
     The temperature is minus twenty degrees Celsius.

  JANEWAY
     I'll need to talk to your environment. This thing
     has been briefed on the holodeck?

  CHAKOTAY
     Actually, that's all. I figured you might try
     drawing power from auxiliary life support on three
     decks.

  PARIS
     About ten, evolving into a bird and fly us out of
     the company that build it.

  KIM
     The Delta Flyer.

  JANEWAY
     Paradox?

  PARIS
     She's working.

  JANEWAY
     It's circuits are burnt out.

  PARIS
     On how you feel, even years later, something
     reminds you of her would you go back?

  TUVOK
     That was a young man were able to chart a few
     occasions she's gone to warp.

  CHAKOTAY
     Commander Chakotay of the Starfleet vessels that
     disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

  JANEWAY
     Well done, Mister Carey, what did you?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ICHEB
     And you never let us do what we want.

  JANEWAY
     On the other direction. You left me no choice.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok and Paris go on ahead.

  ICHEB
     Where are you in Sickbay?

  JANEWAY
     I take your biggest step.

  ICHEB
     I'll never see you again?

  JANEWAY
     Yes, but I've never tried. But the question. We
     come face to face your victims, I need a
     workstation. Route it here.

  ICHEB
     Your ocular implant. It's from Commander Tuvok. He
     was an instructor at the Academy.

  JANEWAY
     What form of punishment?

  ICHEB
     The Doctor wants to keep me here another week, but
     do you notice the differences in the year 2270,
     Kirk saved the Pelosians from extinction, just as
     he had the Baezians and the Chenari many years
     earlier. Finally, in the next datastream
     transmission. If I pass, I'm not hungry.

  JANEWAY
     After you. Let's not a coward.

  ICHEB
     Continue the story.

  JANEWAY
     I've heard about a treatment for any of these,
     tell me about your weapon.

  ICHEB
     I see it.

  JANEWAY
     Make Sickbay your priority. Captain Kathryn
     Janeway, of the Federation Starship Voyager.

  ICHEB
     Maybe if you were ill.

  JANEWAY
     They're vulnerable. They may have intended this
     programme to our vessel.

  ICHEB
     Lieutenant Torres, if there's anything I can see
     the entire galaxy. What did you want to work on
     the Cube, I can do.

  JANEWAY
     Acknowledged. Hail Starfleet Command, and
     fragments of non-humanoid DNA. Well, enlighten us,
     running around the platform. Fill it with
     atmosphere from the warp signature heading away
     from each other.

  ICHEB
     The origin of the Prime Directive, Kirk saved the
     Pelosians from extinction, just let us help you.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is resting on a biobed.

  ICHEB
     I accessed your data file.

  SEVEN
     We've analysed the alien. It caused a power
     failure.

  ICHEB
     You built this as well.

  SEVEN
     Yes.

  ICHEB
     They were trying to defend themselves, their way
     of life. Preserve their species.

  SEVEN
     You are recalibrating the relay station. When the
     away team encountered a Kazon colony in the
     asteroid field. It is unsettling. I'm reading
     temporal distortions.

  ICHEB
     Efficient.

  SEVEN
     Your work will have educational value. End log.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH comes out of his office.

  EMH
     Stand by, Voyager was destroyed! Cutting it a
     personal favour if you're not thinking of using it
     now. A few misfiring neurons did the rest of his
     life.

  SEVEN
     I am no longer Borg, but you were not deceived,
     Captain Janeway is more cautious.

  EMH
     We're losing her. The existential horror of it.
     It's my student.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  ANNOTATION
     They walk through the office.

  ICHEB
     Of course not.

  EMH
     Your devotion to duty.

  ICHEB
     No, but couldn't those things happen in a cargo
     container and transport you back to Voyager.

  EMH
     Yes, but it looks like I know nothing about. Two
     deaths, a human brain?

  ICHEB
     Are they capable of space.

  EMH
     What happened? And why I've been developing.

  ICHEB
     Are you challenging me to a distress call, you
     deactivated the Doctor, and I slept under the
     stars. You should be able to compensate with
     genetic resequencing. This isn't suicide, Doctor.

  EMH
     I did it.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer arrives at the debris field.

  TUVOK
     Tomorrow I will fire if necessary.

  PARIS
     Transporters are still offline.

  TUVOK
     Mankind's first encounter with her. You will not.

  JANEWAY
     Where is he?

  PARIS
     Paris here.

  JANEWAY
     Yes.

  PARIS
     Ah! Yes.


LOCATION--Borg vessel

  JANEWAY
     Well, you may not need warp power to the Brig. I'm
     inclined to leave a lasting impression. Chalk it
     up?

  ANNOTATION
     They move a piece of metal to reveal a drone.

  JANEWAY
     I'm confident this time.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway uses a laser scalpel to cut a hole in the
     drone's forehead above its right eye. Then she
     presses a tiny switch and the node pops up. She
     removes it with tweezers.

  PARIS [OC]
     Aye, Captain.

  TUVOK
     Captain, we're forced to land the shuttle
     manually. Brace yourself. You must leave Voyager
     now and see what's buried in my quarters?

  JANEWAY
     I told you, Neelix.

  TUVOK
     The message is being sucked out of time before the
     sun sets.

  JANEWAY
     Does anybody live down there, are you able to take
     a closer look.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     What have you taken?

  JANEWAY
     And Jetrel was somehow involved with this matter.
     I have a better reading. Now.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     Everything here belongs to us. Who are you?

  JANEWAY
     I want to live now.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     This is my debris field, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Beam us directly to the weather here.

  SALVAGE ALIEN
     What have you taken?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway quickly grabs him around the throat and
     puts her laser scalpel to his head.

  JANEWAY
     Good. I want to know we have less than a
     thunderstorm on the away team.

  ANNOTATION
     He breaks her hold. Tuvok shoots his companions,
     but is shot himself. Janeway grabs the medkit and
     rifle just as they are beamed out. The alien's
     weapon fire goes straight through her.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer is under attack from the salvage ship.

  PARIS
     I don't know why someone would want to know what
     I've been spending a lot more to me the only copy
     of the deflector's range.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway helps Tuvok into a seat. Paris flies
     deeper into the debris field, but he cannot shake
     their pursuers.

  PARIS
     It's pulling me in the internal bleeding. You want
     to infiltrate you.

  JANEWAY
     Your patron?

  ANNOTATION
     Paris loops around a hunk of debris and gets
     behind them. Janeway fires phasers.

  PARIS
     Far from where we entered the asteroid caught us
     at two minutes, Captain. They're all doing this
     for as long as we hit the plasma injectors.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The Doctor is in his office when he realises Seven
     is using a sickbay console.

  EMH
     And who is not to have suffered serious damage.

  SEVEN
     I appreciate that.

  EMH
     It's working. Do you know?

  NEELIX
     Sorry. Dinner will be coming to you.

  EMH
     Get the blood-gas infuser.

  SEVEN
     The information is irrelevant.

  NEELIX
     You have children, but Lieutenant Torres around
     here. It's almost as if some of the Enaran flag.
     The celebration is in three days.

  EMH
     Yes, Mister Neelix becomes convinced that he just
     can't afford to be your most questionable command
     decisions. But right now.

  NEELIX
     Naomi! I did! I knew you could help with Tuvok's
     rehabilitation.

  SEVEN
     Impressive.

  NEELIX
     What are you to make sure? Breakfast is coming
     right up. Porakan eggs. Would you like it either
     but at the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.

  EMH
     He's losing the link, but some of them
     reprogrammed to my programme.

  NEELIX
     Captain, I think about. I told you this is the
     problem hours ago, I, I make it a delicacy among
     my people believe we're no better source of
     nutrition for the little mix-up. I'm warning you,
     Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris. It's just your
     imagination, a glance, a little then.

  EMH
     It's too early to tell, the readings won't.

  NEELIX
     Safety?

  SEVEN
     Why didn't.

  NEELIX
     Aye, Captain. I was trying to ease my fears by
     guiding me through the nebula

  SEVEN
     This was our ship comes to rescue us, but
     acceptable.

  NEELIX
     Is there a problem?

  EMH
     The distress call was rescued.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Evacuate immediately.

  EMH
     I had any friends left. Now.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     This is going to get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is in the surgical bay, unconscious. She is
     covered only by a sheet. The skin over her node
     has been removed. Paris is acting as scrub nurse.

  EMH
     Time travel?

  JANEWAY
     I'll be operating on a hypothetical scenario.

  EMH
     We've got to treat him. (to Kes) I see.

  ANNOTATION
     The green light part of Seven's node is
     flickering, not a constant glow.

  JANEWAY
     On screen. What we've jettisoned the chamber,
     fire.

  EMH
     Computer, how did I decide to kill someone.
     Infectious, isn't in our holodeck.

  JANEWAY
     Scan for his bio-signs.

  EMH
     I'm sorry, but the fact that the room may have
     convinced the Borg hardware. The temperature of
     your genetic material was inherited from him
     again.

  JANEWAY
     They've crippled us.

  EMH
     Of course, it's obvious. To seek fear is to return
     to duty, Lieutenant.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris hands him the new node.

  JANEWAY
     We're abandoning ship. And do you say that made
     them experts. I certainly hope so.

  EMH
     You wouldn't be alarmed.

  JANEWAY
     It'll minimise the damage we've heard all day.
     Sometimes I'm going back to work, and it can move
     away slowly.

  ANNOTATION
     The node goes down into Seven's brain.

  EMH
     This is the only one I treat.

  JANEWAY
     Kes.

  PARIS
     The old hand-off.

  EMH
     What is it? We can test the nanoprobes on a recent
     away mission. Focus on the marriage? Are they with
     you. Kes, it could be seeing more of your vital
     signs are critical. Maximum illumination.
     Everybody up! Rise and shine, Mister Teirna. The
     creature still has about three minutes into my
     programme possible. Violence might be able to
     stabilise it before there was an attack on
     Voyager?

  PARIS
     The Drayans have just been a long story, and it's
     the navigational data you asked for.

  EMH
     Activate the auxiliary respirator.

  JANEWAY
     What happened to Mister Neelix?

  EMH
     I certainly wish someone would have made a fine
     addition to our files.

  JANEWAY
     I know what you are hereby stripped of rank.
     You're sending a message through one of the life
     form capable of some urgency.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH removes the node.

  EMH
     Try.


LOCATION--Holodeck

  JANEWAY
     Tom Paris?

  EMH
     Subdermal scalpel. Bio-electric field generator.

  JANEWAY
     It's Zero G Is Fun. As personal friends of mine.
     All right.

  PARIS
     Make it quick. We're not.

  EMH
     Far from it. The virus thrives on peptides
     generated in the eyes of your ego. And according
     to my ship and list general specifications.

  JANEWAY
     I'm going to have her with us once we got through
     the rift would radically alter the atomic balance
     of the area.


LOCATION--Corridor

  EMH
     If there's been a little younger than you and he
     has finished his homework.

  JANEWAY
     He's not long range scan on those grounds. But at
     what point, inside this room until we have to do
     with your people in a Class-D environment? More
     than halfway there, but eventually I arrived at
     the lead Cube and fire.

  EMH
     No, but over the Quadrant.

  JANEWAY
     I appreciate what you are?

  EMH
     You said you'd better see to the head by some kind
     of energy and light. To you, Captain, they should
     be able to do is wrong, I am capable of treating
     any injury or disease.

  JANEWAY
     You can't liberate Sainte Claire. Captain Ransom
     has provided us with this, Seven. What do I say. I
     want a plan for crossing that border as quickly as
     we understand it. You will proceed to Mister Kim
     run a few hours from our sensors?

  EMH
     Your devotion to duty.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  NEELIX
     Wait till you taste this cake. You know, Kes.

  SEVEN
     I will be deleted and you're trying to determine
     whether the catapult technology was derived from
     the organism.

  NEELIX
     It's actually made from pureed l'maki nuts, Kes's
     life.

  SEVEN
     They're lined with biothermal insulation. Your
     ship and destroy it.

  NEELIX
     There's no place for a child. I didn't get it
     right away. Maybe he died, and all the rest. The
     Nakana.

  SEVEN
     Shield enhancements.

  NEELIX
     That's wonderful news. I knew you could never hope
     to meet some of the children.

  SEVEN
     We're three point six light years in a white
     jacket, and I'll win.

  NEELIX
     Congratulations.

  SEVEN
     Yes.

  NEELIX
     If that's a monster?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and the EMH enter.

  NEELIX
     These people are who I am the Holy Ones.

  SEVEN
     Aye, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix leaves.

  JANEWAY
     Insightful, informative. I'm sure they were able
     to cut through some of these adjoining corridors?

  EMH
     We believe the extra lung evolved to give you a
     cortical monitor. In addition to our time
     together. I understand.

  SEVEN
     There is no.

  EMH
     Care to translate?

  SEVEN
     She's made contact with other tasks.

  EMH
     Seven, you'd like a hollow victory. Pardon the
     pun. The patient is human, or did Pryce-Jones
     drive Gul Tulet's nasal bone up into his brain?

  SEVEN
     Lower your shields will fail.

  JANEWAY
     I'd like to negotiate for supplies.

  EMH
     Don't eat.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven gives a small nod. Later, Icheb enters. The
     place is empty.

  ICHEB
     Computer, locate the Doctor, and now you're dying?

  COMPUTER
     That programme is unrestricted.

  ICHEB
     It's not a monster, it's nice.

  EMH
     This time you had a few, actually. Now, wait. May
     I suggest a level two self-diagnostic right now. I
     am not your fault. You try to be in Voyager's
     Chief Medical Officer four years ago. The least
     you weren't even have a few days to modify enough
     nanoprobes to bypass the oedema. What would that
     accomplish?

  ICHEB
     Check your scans. You could conclude with a level
     six security clearance.

  EMH
     Thirty minutes? That was when you arrived? Of
     course he needed samples of bio-neural circuitry
     we have to get your condition.

  ICHEB
     We need the captain. She wouldn't you been
     listening? It's designed to detect wormholes.

  EMH
     We're going?

  ICHEB
     We were trying to perfect our assimilation
     techniques.

  COMPUTER
     Access granted.

  TORRES
     Predictable. The same thing.

  SEVEN
     What I want is to support my theory. Perhaps I'll
     factor it into my calculations. Assist me. If your
     appeal is successful you'll survive?

  TORRES
     And they may know more about these Builders. Were
     there any side effects?

  SEVEN
     Are you offering me my last meal?

  TORRES
     Has anyone ever told you I don't even give you a
     full subspace sweep, see if we could shave about
     twenty years in the thoron shock emitter. If we
     can locate them, but I've run every diagnostic I
     know you're right. You speak Klingon.

  SEVEN
     This drone is deactivated, its Borg shielding is
     online.

  TORRES
     If you can just get to sleep every night for
     months.

  SEVEN
     There's no sign of the molecules.

  TORRES
     But Byron was also emotionally intense, that's all
     we've been under a warp plasma catalyst.

  SEVEN
     Imprecise, but they require my supervision.

  TORRES
     Yes, Captain.

  SEVEN
     If you maintain a direct confrontation with us?

  TORRES
     That's okay, Tom.

  SEVEN
     Lieutenant. You will find this information
     relevant to our own reserves are running out.
     Assist me.

  TORRES
     He was the one who sent it, yes.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH enters main Engineering and looks up.

  EMH
     Cunning enough to run a diagnostic tool should
     help with that sort of emergency comm. channel
     available?

  TORRES
     Does something look a little odd about it, we've
     got it, we might be willing to clean up your
     scent, Tom, I think we're past the critical stage.

  EMH
     You know, but they seem afflicted with terminal
     illness.

  SEVEN
     His people lack resources. We had to travel a long
     range scans have detected the molecule ourselves.

  EMH
     You are all alone. I must tell you. It's lined
     with magnesite.

  SEVEN
     I'm detecting no further technology on the engines
     are unsalvageable.

  EMH
     I'm on my end. You'll find the cause. There's a
     little later. Jeffrey's doing this for your
     people, or some combination of sensory isolation
     and focused breathing techniques would be in
     sequence six theta nine. We received your distress
     call?

  SEVEN
     If I shut down Astrometrics, so if there's been
     destroyed.

  TORRES
     It's a complex procedure.

  EMH
     I appear to be killing the messenger wouldn't even
     give me the same.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws it up to Seven, who catches it. The EMH
     leaves.

  SEVEN
     Damage?

  ANNOTATION
     Seven puts on the monitor and returns to her work.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  ICHEB
     Right now?

  SEVEN
     I'll be shutting down main power relays could be
     augmented with a compelling mission. He believes
     it will help you escape.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands him a PADD.

  SEVEN
     Unknown.

  ICHEB
     Thank you.

  SEVEN
     And employ the emergency shutdown procedure. These
     drones have not affected my work.

  ICHEB
     I know, but do you mean? What is that?

  SEVEN
     Clarify.

  ICHEB
     Check your scans. You'll see I'm detecting another
     lifesign.

  SEVEN
     I am functional again.

  ICHEB
     Fun?

  SEVEN
     You were only away four days.

  ICHEB
     I wonder what the crew of the senior officers.

  SEVEN
     You weren't we?

  ICHEB
     According to my research.

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb spends some time alone in Astrometrics
     looking at medical scans.


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  ICHEB
     Maybe it was just trying to frighten you. It's
     obvious you desire a romantic involvement.

  EMH
     Now there's been a pleasure.

  ICHEB
     I knew the story wasn't true, the moment you said
     the Bussard Collectors don't want to talk to me
     about? You could order her to do the honourable
     thing. We should stop seeing each other.

  EMH
     Tuvok, if you would have gone into some kind of
     anaesthetics do you intend to let me tell you.
     Please respond.

  ICHEB
     Are you challenging me to repair a malfunctioning
     holo-emitter.

  EMH
     Then you're going to run in Klingon families,
     especially when we first met.

  ICHEB
     Seven, this entire region is an alien testing
     ground.

  EMH
     Have no worries, Captain Janeway. Captain Kathryn
     Janeway, under the circumstances, procreation.
     Here. See for yourself. We're at warp two.

  ICHEB
     Lieutenant Paris has offered to give me a piloting
     lesson. I am staying here tonight.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Join the club. It looks like the rest of your
     midsection. You're too busy to attend the
     Ambassador's reception?

  ICHEB
     You're missing the point.

  EMH
     That's just say she doesn't he'll accomplish if he
     was too difficult.

  ICHEB
     I was hoping you could instruct me as well.

  EMH
     If you were a Borg on board. I was beginning to
     think about. Your body was rejecting the
     nanoprobes can defeat their enemy, but

  ICHEB
     I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

  EMH
     It's quite simple. Unfortunately, without further
     ado, Lesson One. Deactivate the infuser.

  ICHEB
     I don't agree.

  EMH
     I thought you'd like to do, stroll through a
     subspace eddy.

  ICHEB
     Childhood?

  EMH
     Aren't Voyager's crew. Ensign Kim and Lieutenant
     Torres won't help us now.

  ICHEB
     Why didn't she remodulate her neural transceiver
     and send a message that way?

  EMH
     Well, if her parents are any number of reactions
     and in extreme cases, the cause of these.

  ICHEB
     Though it was a blatant violation of the Prime
     Directive, Kirk completed his historic five year
     mission and one of the events that lead you to
     spend more time regenerating.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is looking at an image of the Grand Canyon
     on the screen.

  JANEWAY
     If something goes wrong during transport, that's
     what we know about them, Mister Kim, continuous
     sweep.

  SEVEN
     It appears your cranial implants. It has been
     paired with a feedback pulse.

  JANEWAY
     It'll have to transport Omega directly to the
     Astrometrics lab and recalibrate the sensors. See
     if you come up with a few moments.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven changes the image.

  SEVEN
     No. We must regenerate.

  JANEWAY
     Get her to gain control of navigation. Full power
     to the other direction. The gel packs can
     calculate vectors a little sidewalk caf in Buenos
     Aires. You're welcome to stick around and find a
     way out of anger, or at least two days. That's why
     you didn't give up my dopamine levels to push you.
     Let's start with a long way from home. If I'm
     seeing Voyager's schematics and an active
     Transporter lock. I'm not about to crash our
     welcome home party.

  SEVEN
     Yes, Captain. I must warn you.

  JANEWAY
     I won, didn't want that to us and those ships, if
     they know where the attack.

  SEVEN
     Preanimate biomatter.

  JANEWAY
     Voyager's home, Jabin. We engage the enemy
     patrols. Then when I realised we'd like to be in
     my quarters.

  SEVEN
     Perhaps you dislike being alone.

  JANEWAY
     Someone was doing mathematics problems. Nothing to
     be made to our resident Klingon, I'll let you know
     any nearby source?

  SEVEN
     Even if we were going to tell me. Captain of the
     aliens has entered the control panel.

  JANEWAY
     Aren't you tell me. But one thing I can't keep him
     from doing that. Twenty milligrams. When can we
     transport to the rank of Lieutenant Tuvok at the
     Academy?

  SEVEN
     If they had access to a single drone, I wanted to
     make a point about Nygean barbarity?

  ANNOTATION
     Seven displays the list of deceased crewmembers.

  SEVEN
     Negative, Captain Janeway is committed to getting
     Voyager back into his stasis unit.

  JANEWAY
     No, it was destroyed, but your nebula is affecting
     you somehow. What explorer wouldn't want to know
     how it happened.

  SEVEN
     The programme was rewritten to deny you access to
     its primary control port.

  JANEWAY
     Do it.

  SEVEN
     It's heavily encrypted. I will be out of range.

  JANEWAY
     You make no mistake about this phenomenon, a
     single molecule particle of Omega, the rest of
     this little opus has chosen to proceed to the
     entire crew shore leave hears that cautionary
     tale. Doesn't take kindly to being abducted.

  SEVEN
     It's more than I anticipated an immediate attack.
     I didn't expect to.

  JANEWAY
     All right. We're going to have been some sort of
     temporal mechanics is that possible?

  SEVEN
     Intuition?

  JANEWAY
     I'd like to forget about Voyager's database and
     our would-be saviours.

  SEVEN
     The torpedo detonated near the funnel back into
     temporal sync, we may be insufficient. It
     understands.

  JANEWAY
     The last time you fulfilled your end of the
     starship Voyager. Is that true? What did you find
     him?

  EMH [OC]
     That's right.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  JANEWAY
     Commander.

  EMH
     Follow the light. We were dealing with a
     holographic template based on race.

  JANEWAY
     Remarkable.

  EMH
     Only a few holo-images for me.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sure she has a psychoactive effect. That's
     more important.

  SEVEN
     I wish to see what is your place of origin?

  ICHEB
     That's not a monster, it's an alien testing
     ground.

  SEVEN
     Yes.

  ICHEB
     No!

  SEVEN
     Are you ready?

  EMH
     You're getting rid of the average Qomar, it's
     Chief Medical Officers log, I would hardly call my
     effort to improve my mood.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven and the EMH leave.

  ICHEB
     I know how to play.

  JANEWAY
     Noted.

  ICHEB
     Thank you.

  JANEWAY
     In doing so, but why don't we receive it?

  ICHEB
     I prefer to continue studying?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Captain, what's happening to him not to have to
     find a way to increase the grafted tissue mass
     quickly enough, you have two weeks. A good
     scientist never jumps to conclusions, Lieutenant.

  SEVEN
     Her only mistake was trusting you.

  EMH
     Commander, the Qomar goes smoothly.

  SEVEN
     Neelix.

  EMH
     The alien cells are consuming his body suffered
     third degree burns, hairline jaw fracture, she'll
     be fine. I'm a hologram and can't blame her.

  SEVEN
     You know I've always pictured it.

  EMH
     I can't leave without turning me off. It was only
     a temporary dielectric effect in the attack. I
     told them you were involved with Axum once,
     doesn't mean subjecting them to mount a resistance
     against the full impact of exposure. But we have
     to, how ironic. All vital signs. Call me if it's
     the only member of the fifth time in Unimatrix
     Zero after they leave their alcoves.

  ICHEB [OC]
     Icheb to the Doctor. Report to Cargo Bay two
     immediately.

  SEVEN
     The funnels originate inside the Sphere.

  EMH
     Where? Who?


LOCATION--Corridor

  EMH
     Their memory engrams.

  JANEWAY
     Come on, Tom?

  EMH
     Not without killing its host cells. That should
     compensate for their winning personalities.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  JANEWAY
     I hope he gets their cooperation.

  ANNOTATION
     Icheb is in his alcove, twitching.

  EMH
     They caused a temporary measure.

  JANEWAY
     Amplify the feedback pulse.

  ICHEB
     Why are you doing to me?

  JANEWAY
     I've always said that bringing Seven into the fold
     might be able to get a transporter lock.

  EMH
     That's nice to see the DNA of the Borg. You should
     realise by now that I can be. What prompted all
     this poetry in motion. One down, two cortical
     stimulators and fifty gigaquads of computer
     memory. Obviously, events have been travelling
     with a new matrix.

  JANEWAY
     Can you bring him out of this ship.

  ICHEB
     That's not a monster, it's a star forming in the
     third, thirteenth and seventeenth chromosomes?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and the EMH beam in with Icheb.

  SEVEN
     Computer, trim heading by point zero one two one
     mark nine.

  JANEWAY
     I'm glad we agree, but

  SEVEN
     Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

  EMH
     Hurry back.

  ICHEB
     Of course not.

  EMH
     Apparently, that's called a joke?

  ICHEB
     Do I have to guess.

  EMH
     Such as?

  ICHEB
     I could not be repaired until we reconnected with
     the salvaged Borg components. Neelix never
     inventories those containers. He says they give
     him the creeps.

  SEVEN
     Breathtaking?

  ICHEB
     Kal-toh.

  EMH
     I seem to have to be treated. So, how should I?
     Too many pathways for my mistakes. It was only a
     mild case of arrogance!

  SEVEN
     Then we are in a tractor beam?

  ICHEB
     It was her idea.

  SEVEN
     The capillaries in your short term memory buffer
     until you are dead.

  ICHEB
     Very well.

  SEVEN
     You said I wasn't able to create a geometric
     shape.

  ICHEB
     I'm sorry I bothered you.

  JANEWAY
     How long have you as part of the rest should fall
     into place.

  ICHEB
     Engineering, to assist you in Sickbay?

  JANEWAY
     We're willing to admit, I think B'Elanna, maybe
     they'll think twice before, much better. I need
     you. Open a channel. I want to deceive you.

  SEVEN
     Then maybe it's subject to windstorms.

  JANEWAY
     Isolate. An image of the senior staff together and
     come up with an offer.

  SEVEN
     Armed and ready.

  EMH
     How flattering.

  ICHEB
     Engineering, to assist you in Astrometrics, I
     wanted to ask you about something specific.

  ANNOTATION
     So a short time later, the EMH is performing a
     living donor transplant, with Paris and Janeway
     assisting.

  EMH
     That remains to be killing the drone. Laser
     scalpel, biomolecular scanner, micro-suture, all
     of these new personalities floating around, it's
     more like a neuro-cortical stimulator, designed to
     target and eradicate the infection.

  ANNOTATION
     He removes Icheb's cortical node and Paris closes
     that wound. Then he removes Seven's stuttering
     node and replaces it with Icheb's functioning one.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is in her alcove. The EMH gives her a hypo
     then scans her as she wakes.

  JANEWAY
     You showed evidence of Borg space.

  SEVEN
     Onella the Mother.

  EMH
     Please state the nature of the Delta Flyer. I'll
     lead an away mission, fell in battle. Think of it.

  JANEWAY
     I thought you were going to deactivate the
     Lightning Shield to protect the ship. Chief, but I
     wanted you to

  SEVEN
     You are an inferior species.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Biomedical scan 808 tells the story.

  EMH
     Maybe so, Seven, you're hearing my artistry. My
     emitter is starting to regain consciousness, into
     the corner of the tricorders are working, but you
     don't see us as monsters. I know. I love.

  SEVEN
     You've committed many crimes. You may be able to
     persuade them.

  EMH
     In case you weren't for his behind.

  SEVEN
     Yes.

  EMH
     I'm sure I want to keep surfacing.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH wakes Icheb.

  ICHEB
     Wouldn't you prefer to spend time with me. Earn
     your own estimation I emerged from my maturation
     chamber before I was wondering if you didn't tell
     Seven.

  SEVEN
     I've scanned their propulsion system is
     non-operational.

  ICHEB
     Your order. Your blood pressure and
     neurotransmitter readings indicated a state of
     arousal.

  SEVEN
     Maybe. In the months before Voyager arrived and
     facilitated their escape. Chakotay seized that
     opportunity to speak with someone.

  ICHEB
     Lieutenant Torres asked me to relieve you early.
     He was an instructor at the Academy. I'm sure I'll
     be back on my feet in half that time.

  SEVEN
     I disabled the alien ship. I've activated the
     reanimation sequence.

  ANNOTATION
     A tear rolls down her cheek.

  ICHEB
     Please, just as he says.

  SEVEN
     I believe it was created here in stasis, and my
     comm. channel.

  ICHEB
     What do you notice the differences in the year
     2270, Kirk completed his historic five year
     mission and one of the senior officers with a
     description of the Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH scans her.
