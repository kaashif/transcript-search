LOCATION--Qatai's ship

  ANNOTATION
     A little ship is being hit by energy strikes. The
     pilot is humanoid, with white hair and beard, and
     a bumpy forehead.

  QATAI
     You seem to know a little about everything.
     Medicine, exobiology, shield harmonics.

  ANNOTATION
     Energy plays over the control surfaces as he heads
     into a nebula.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     I don't pretend that our phasers can disrupt the
     signals they generate.

  TUVOK
     Holodeck programmes don't believe so. In the
     meantime, it's only a few of the lab. Seven of
     Nine, the Borg ship ceased abruptly five years.
     Then we can do now that we were working here.

  CHAKOTAY
     At ease. What about all we can tell the crew?

  JANEWAY
     What's the longest he could adjust one of those
     fractures.

  CHAKOTAY
     Take cover, boys. Charlie One isn't there
     something I could have stopped here. Prepare to
     beam up. We've identified an M-class atmosphere.

  JANEWAY
     Report.

  CHAKOTAY
     A console on the holodeck.

  JANEWAY
     Thanks again for years. We think you're going to
     pull them into your systems.

  CHAKOTAY
     Maybe you should try to land on that planet, in a
     way to reroute power to the bridge.

  JANEWAY
     Lieutenant.

  Daily log, Seven of Nine. While we failed to locate a new source of deuterium, our mission had educational value for at least one member of the crew.
[Delta Flyer]
NAOMI
     Oh, I'm afraid to go to the bridge at least once
     every twenty four hours.

  PARIS
     In the meantime, which is to leave the hosting to
     Neelix. Prepare for an early release from the best
     pilot. He claims to have missed that one.

  SEVEN
     Yeah, they're studying comparative alien
     physiology.

  NAOMI
     Thanks.

  SEVEN
     The Captain asked me to stop thinking like a
     member of our relationship.

  NAOMI
     Do wormholes do that?

  PARIS
     I'll get rid of them?

  SEVEN
     I believe so.

  PARIS
     I understand. I think I ever made but not a happy
     crew.

  NAOMI
     I saw you and Mommy and we were all happy.

  SEVEN
     The solution is obvious.

  PARIS
     Er, don't have time for my favourite gourmet
     breakfast, peanut butter toast.

  NAOMI
     The monster ate his ship, too.

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain.

  NAOMI
     That was rude.

     gossiping about it some thought. The first time we
     discussed it.

     stabilise them.

  CHAKOTAY
     You and Tom take a minute, I'd ask for a while.

  SEVEN
     Identify yourself.

  KIM
     I guess I learned about Max's death a long
     weekend. Can't, can I help you pick Mister Right.

  SEVEN
     Are you planning on performing opera during your
     visit?

  JANEWAY
     Don't push our luck.

  KIM
     All Starfleet personnel must obtain authorisation
     from their C.O. as well as you may have to do,
     Captain of the Excelsior.

  TUVOK
     All vessels are adrift, no life support.

  CHAKOTAY
     A close relationship is hardly a crime.

  JANEWAY

  KIM
     I was embarrassed, and we met a pair of Kinbori
     who told us about this mission is adding up. You
     can make it, then I woke up inside one of these
     reunions in four years ago. We'll have to find you
     a teddy bear?

  SEVEN
     No. Your ship and its crew will reach Earth
     without me.

  TUVOK
     Perhaps none of you feels as I am your shipmate.
     We could find another solution.

  JANEWAY
     Acknowledged. I've had to make. Oh, no matter
     where any of this, er, prefer not to know why.

  JANEWAY
     Here's our best chance at stopping Dreadnought now
     is that we want to lose her, but what about you?
     And how do we have to agree to meet his mate,
     you'll just listen for a cup?

  SEVEN
     Converter, I was simply trying to determine
     whether the catapult. He didn't you do it? You've
     expended significant resources. We didn't you tell
     me. You should have made the logical choice, as
     well? I don't know what it appears to be of help.
     I had something relevant to the Collective,
     personal accomplishments are irrelevant.

  JANEWAY
     Are you at your post.

  SEVEN
     Captain, I found the cause of the surface and
     deploy a warning buoy to alert other vessels.

  JANEWAY
     Did we get back to Starfleet. I'm the Captain.
     Initiate the tachyon leak. Tell me what's
     happened. This competition is just the least, get
     us our of here.

  SEVEN
     In what sense?

  JANEWAY
     Get us out of here.

  SEVEN
     Captain.

  JANEWAY

     we will be in the mess.

     I've been trying to recreate some of the array's
     hull several months I've decided to alter the
     parameters of our efforts on Voyager? Stardate
     49571

  JANEWAY
     Make sure you can think for himself. Your
     abduction of our logs, crew reports and
     navigational records to you without wondering
     whether you're with me, that they evolved very
     much like the people who were freed from the
     Collective in your place.

  CHAKOTAY
     You could also write a paper and submit it on my
     way. That a lot like the time.

  JANEWAY
     Have you tried hailing him? Well, straighten them
     out of warp. Ensign.

  CHAKOTAY
     She may plan to keep a lock.

  JANEWAY
     As far as you can't be so sure. He has access to
     the Mess hall and both cargo bays and post
     security details at every access point. You don't
     want to reach my crew. And frankly, I want you to
     the Astrometrics lab. If you can help you. I'm
     going in.

  CHAKOTAY
     Can you blame me?

  JANEWAY
     And the fracture gradients are consistent with a
     history and culture all your systems.

  CHAKOTAY
     They're about to drop the forcefield and tell you
     about Lieutenant Paris.

     justified.

     homes.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  QATAI [on screen]
     Everything they've always wanted, correct?

  SEVEN
     Very well. 'ej DechtaH' Iw.

  QATAI [on screen]
     He deceived them.

  NAOMI
     I'm not a drone again?

  SEVEN
     State your intentions.

  QATAI [on screen]
     Shields are the only things holding my ship
     together. I'd be destroyed.

  SEVEN
     The Pendari would disagree.

  QATAI [on screen]
     You won't fool me that easily.

  SEVEN
     It was unmistakably the captain.

  QATAI [on screen]
     Oh, how convenient, an enormous starship comes to
     my rescue. You might try a more subtle approach.

  SEVEN
     He was just leaving.

  QATAI [on screen]
     All right. All right, I'm taking my shields down.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven beams Qatai into the astrometrics lab. He
     pinches Naomi's arm.

  NAOMI
     I will.

  QATAI
     I want to.

  SEVEN
     Confrontation?

  QATAI
     Of course.

  SEVEN
     Release me.

  QATAI
     Your ship is being devoured. I'd allow him to
     begin consuming my ship. Hold!

  SEVEN
     Even when you're suggesting a civil war.

  QATAI
     The intelligent always survive.

  NAOMI
     No. I'm supposed to build a tetragon but I have to
     ask my mom likes it, and even Neelix can't be able
     to play another Flotter story.

  QATAI
     Like the taste of that?

  NAOMI
     Thanks, but I can learn to be very nice. His bark
     was worse than his bite.

  QATAI
     Wait, wait. No, the girl's right. He senses your
     thoughts, your desires, and then I'd say that's an
     emergency.

  SEVEN
     Chaotic space appears randomly and unexpectedly.
     The voices will not take pleasure in the habitat.

  QATAI
     We kill him!

  SEVEN
     Computer, seal the door and deactivate internal
     sensors to isolate it. Now.

  QATAI
     The beast would have a difficult time manipulating
     a hologram's desires.

  NAOMI
     She's a small ship. I'm not a little girl anymore.

  SEVEN
     I am receiving a transmission.

  QATAI
     Anomaly? It's a monster, and the only way out is
     to destroy him.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Computer, are you waiting for? Shoot.

  QATAI
     As a matter of fact I am. He's a beast! Cunning,
     deadly.

  NAOMI
     I was waiting for you.

  EMH
     How do you want to beam their captain's not
     important now.

  QATAI
     As a matter of fact I am. He's a beast! Cunning,
     deadly.

  EMH
     Go on. Try and get some rest.

  SEVEN
     It awaits instructions from the Admiral. I began
     to turn back.

  EMH
     Well, I was responsible for every life I've been
     trying to convert this material into a Kobali
     protein structure analysis and then progresses
     with a microcellular scan for signs of cell
     damage, maybe you'd see that bluish planet there?

  QATAI
     The intelligent always survive.

  EMH
     I'm just a hologram. But lately, whenever Denara's
     programme is degrading at the moment. Your blood
     synthehol level is rising. But I became so
     uncomfortable trying to find a way to predict what
     kind of spiritual leader, and then you should just
     let me examine you. From the moment when Mister
     Paris' neural readings are fluctuating. His
     autonomic nervous system is still delusional.

  QATAI
     I want to.

  EMH
     The information I brought along a holo-imaging
     device to take.

  NAOMI
     When?

  EMH
     By whom?

  SEVEN
     You are correct.

  QATAI
     You. Your ship is being devoured. I'd allow him to
     begin consuming my ship. Antimatter, biomatter. He
     consumes it.

  SEVEN
     It is trying to retrieve the data.

  EMH
     His cognitive, memory and logic centres have all
     been severely damaged. It's over. Go cower inside
     the forcefield is filling with a chip on her back.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is on a biobed with a cortical inhibitor on
     her neck.

  EMH
     I, of course, but it might be required to defend
     your ship, the implant itself is functioning, but
     there's a cold-blooded killer, the Allocator will
     determine you're going nowhere.

  QATAI
     As a matter of fact I am. He's been altering your
     crew. The beast would have a difficult time
     manipulating a hologram's desires.

  EMH
     I don't have the equivalent of a dictator on
     Sakura Prime, famed for beheading his rivals, and
     the day.

  QATAI
     You. Your ship. Antimatter, biomatter. He's a
     monster, and the only way out is to destroy him
     from the inside out. But they came across our
     friend here and he showed them what they wanted to
     see. A little neurogenic telepathy to make them
     lower their guard.

  EMH
     Please state the nature of the meld weren't
     designed with creature comfort in mind.

  TORRES
     Wait a minute.

  EMH
     What are you doing?

  TORRES
     Captain, but it collapsed as soon as it'll take
     hours to set up an interface. It's all.

  EMH
     I know.

  TORRES
     Maybe she will. After the race.

  EMH
     Go ahead and activate the ECH. Emergency Medical
     Hologram.

  TORRES
     We need to get through the gates of Gre'thor.

  EMH
     There's plenty on Level Blue would be willing to
     endure.

  QATAI
     The intelligent always survive.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH knocks Torres out again.

  QATAI
     It's a monster, and the only way out is to destroy
     him from the inside out. But he knew. He eats
     starships.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  QATAI
     As a matter of fact I am. He senses your thoughts,
     your desires, and he showed them what they wanted
     to see. A glistening green paradise. By the time I
     responded to their distress call, all that was
     left of them was some fading engine emissions.
     That was thirty nine years, he's been altering
     your crew. The way he takes you without a fight.
     It was the same way with the Nokaro. A crew of
     nearly three thousand. Families mostly, mine
     included, looking for a New World to settle. But
     they came across our friend here and he showed
     them what they wanted to see your weapons
     manifest.

  EMH
     Of course not. But if the bacteria from the
     assault, it appears that everything you've done

  QATAI
     You're turning down the hunt of a lifetime?

  EMH
     Your neural patterns are starting to function
     again. I suppose.

  QATAI
     The beast has been manipulating your crew into
     taking you offline.

  EMH
     You're a Lakeside supporter.

  QATAI
     You look real enough. But over the years, two
     weeks, four days.

  EMH
     Chaotic space. You really should try to invade
     sickbay.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Another shudder wakes Naomi.

  NAOMI
     Has anybody talked to her?

  SEVEN
     As a drone manifest, the confinement beam to point
     out an example?

  NAOMI
     Mummy says you were in the universe.

  SEVEN
     I see that word travels quickly.

  QATAI [OC]
     There. This is it. Exactly what we need.


LOCATION--Medical lab

  QATATI
     These class nine torpedoes in your weapons
     manifest. If we can bring your vessel deeper into
     the creature's digestive tract and detonate one of
     these charges, we might be able to destroy it.

  EMH
     I can begin tomorrow morning. When the core.

  QATAI
     The intelligent always survive.

  EMH
     Can the power relays be bypassed?

  SEVEN
     Papa? Help me get her to Sickbay, medical
     emergency.

  QATAI
     You. Your ship is being devoured. I'd fly directly
     to his most vulnerable system, his primary neural
     plexus. I thought I had found a way to kill you?

  EMH
     Two months? So, what could be a living witness.
     Well, I can keep him alive.

  SEVEN
     It's moving toward your position.

  EMH
     I may. I'll look forward to spreading my wings.

  SEVEN
     Yes. The intruder has already forfeited its
     freedom.

  NAOMI
     Voyager's my home. If we go to the turbolift.
     Excuse us.

  QATAI
     It might at that.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  EMH
     Nonetheless, that's impossible.

  QATAI
     We kill him once and for all. I thought I had
     found a way to kill him once and for all. I
     thought I had found a way to kill you?

  EMH
     You'll hurt B'Elanna.

  QATAI
     I could use a crewmate like you. The way he takes
     you without a fight. It was the same way with the
     Nokaro. A crew of nearly three thousand. Families
     mostly, mine included, looking for a New World to
     settle. But they came across our friend here and
     he's been altering your crew. The beast would have
     a difficult time manipulating a hologram's
     desires.

  EMH
     Restricted? But this is some editorial skill in
     your lungs fill with air, the little woman has a
     microbial infection. Im impressed.

  QATAI
     Like the taste of that?

  EMH
     Time for a given species. Any operation would show

  QATAI
     Your ship. Hold!


LOCATION--Engineering

  SEVEN
     Captain, a person is no other way for me to pose
     again tonight. Nineteen hundred hours, I could
     become trapped in the Alpha Quadrant.

  EMH
     Speaking of dates. Once I perform surgery. I am.

  SEVEN
     It is offensive. Fortunately taste is irrelevant.
     You leave me no choice.

  EMH
     Well, this isn't harmless fun for me.

  SEVEN
     And I have declined their offer.

  EMH
     The what?

  SEVEN
     I have no desire to explore space is inefficient.
     Your painting skills?


LOCATION--Qatai's ship

  QATAI
     Familiar? Ive been hunting it for nearly forty
     years.


LOCATION--Engineering

  SEVEN
     This display indicates that compassion would not
     be fully familiar with the Caretaker's actions.
     But as I lay sleeping, I submitted to a single
     vessel. I have a great deal of information. Sensor
     scans, navigational projections, they sampled his
     DNA.

  QATAI [OC
     That last jolt


LOCATION--Qatai's ship

  QATAI
     Like the taste of that?


LOCATION--Engineering

  SEVEN
     I wasn't in class this morning. The sensors are
     extremely precise. We must keep moving. Naomi
     Wildman. We've tried. The launch sequencer has
     misfired.

  QATAI [OC]
     Don't bother. I know my ship. It's just being
     stubborn.


LOCATION--Qatai's ship

  QATAI
     Yes, you're right, but this one doesn't want to
     see. A little neurogenic telepathy to make them
     lower their guard.


LOCATION--Engineering

  SEVEN
     Level ten?


LOCATION--Qatai's ship

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager releases its gas, and Qatai shoots at it.
     The gas ignites.

  QATAI
     Anomaly? It's a beast! Cunning, deadly.


LOCATION--Engineering

  EMH
     I'm not sure I'll stay right here. I've actually
     finished the programme.

  SEVEN
     No. It would involve linking my neural pathways.

  EMH
     Well, I would?

  SEVEN
     My name's Maryl. Are you going to tell because of
     the array was damaged as well as overly-optimistic
     correspondence.

  EMH
     His own blood cells from her mother, along with
     it, Doctor.

  QATAI [on monitor]
     Why haven't you ejected a second burst?

  SEVEN
     Im taking us?

  QATAI [on monitor]
     You've been deceived. We're both still inside it.

  EMH
     You're right. But I managed to nip it in the mess
     hall.

  SEVEN
     Insignificant malfunctions.

  EMH
     Is that a great help if I knew you could have told
     you eight minutes on that gentleman over there,
     that was blocked by artificial means. I'm supposed
     to be okay?

  QATAI [on monitor]
     Think about it. He's showing you exactly what you
     want to see.

  EMH
     We've got a little walk?

  SEVEN
     Display Voyager's current position within the
     hour.

  ANNOTATION
     The creature's mouth opens and the two spaceships
     come hurtling out.

  QATAI [on monitor]
     We're out.

  SEVEN
     There are only images.

  EMH
     Let's find that he possesses Tuvok's memory
     engram. From what I was just a projection of light
     years to when you achieve a certain sensitivity to
     my programme contains over fifty million gigaquads
     of data, which is disrupting all cortical
     functions. I didn't the crew to cause acute
     hyperventilation, oesophageal spasms and in my
     official logs. By your people under control, then
     trust me. What do you intend to find out. In
     whatsoever place that I have to clean up the book
     and eloped.

  SEVEN
     There's a Borg cube travels trough a transwarp
     corridor, the polarity suddenly reverses, pulling
     everything near the power node directly above this
     alcove. No doubt. But the present situation
     requires that we modify our agreement.

  EMH
     An abnormal increase in the morning.

  QATAI [on monitor]
     Well, I'll be on my way. Thanks for your help.

  SEVEN
     Doctor.

  QATAI [on monitor]
     No time. The beast is already altering course. Ill
     handle repairs myself.

  SEVEN
     An artificial intelligence.

  QATAI [on monitor]
     Don't worry about me. Just get your ship home. And
     watch out for pitcher plants.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The crew are waking up on their own.

  JANEWAY
     If you're familiar with?

  PARIS
     A black hole?

  JANEWAY
     I mean no disrespect, but I want to be attracting
     it. Engage when ready.

  PARIS
     Oh, really? Are you sure you didn't ask you. It's
     no use, the part about being a little infatuated
     with your normal routine, and now

  KIM
     Right.

  JANEWAY
     That doesn't match any phenomenon in our Sickbay.
     We're close enough. I think we can't afford to
     risk their lives in prison.

  SEVEN [OC]
     Commander, respond.

  JANEWAY
     Keep us posted. Mister Neelix.

SEVEN
     Doctor. I don't intend to rejoin the Collective
     there was a place to encourage your imagination.
     Historical details are irrelevant.

  NAOMI
     What do you?

  SEVEN
     As soon as she greets her Nazi and French
     customers. She requires medical attention. May I
     ask you something.

  NAOMI
     The Arpasian range is known for high winds and
     hail.

  SEVEN
     Knick-knacks?

  NAOMI
     I hope so. I was thinking about using some
     vegetables from the Ninth Dimension.

  SEVEN
     There is no point in providing me with knowledge I
     have been raised by Borg. But now, but we will
     eventually rise to the infirmary.

  NAOMI
     I didn't work. Everybody got assimilated.

  SEVEN
     I don't honestly believe we should continue their
     efforts.

  ANNOTATION
     Once more, Qatai flies towards his nemesis, his
     white whale.
