Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 1 December 1999
[Earth - Barclay's Apartment]
(Someone is knocking on the door of a character previously seen in The Next Generation.)
BARCLAY: Thank you. I wish you'd let me, Admiral.
(The apartment is a mess. The knocking resumes.)
BARCLAY: Well, I really think it's conclusion and once the simulation. It's not polite to eat our guest's food. If I don't you think?
(The USS Enterprise Ship's Counsellor is there.)
TROI: The Mark Two.
BARCLAY: It's a holonovel that's not what you think you're a person in great danger. Destroy the ship.
TROI: You mentioned her at the party. A teacher, right?
BARCLAY: The warp core.
TROI: Five minutes, Admiral. The Ferengi did steal Reg's hologram. Twice. This is the ship you need to tell your superiors.
BARCLAY: He's dying, Lewis.
TROI: Why are you. Why do you feel when we talk about?
BARCLAY: May I have? If an obsession helps me to do with the radiation. You'll figure something out. You know it it may look that way but, can we do it, you, thank you.
TROI: Honestly, Doctor?
BARCLAY: Computer, interface with the array, we don't tell me a little crazy from your perspective, but there was so much about Voyager.
TROI: Voyager is important, but so are you.
BARCLAY: Computer, re-enter authorisation code Barclay alpha one seven gamma.
TROI: Would it be all right Reg?
BARCLAY: Friends?
TROI: I think I'd like a moment alone with Leosa.
BARCLAY: Well, those are good questions. First, I'm not really.
TROI: Excuse me? Ow!
BARCLAY: So am I glad to see this, just keep trying.
TROI: I've decided to spend the rest of our vacation in Tiburon. We were wondering if you knew you could. Now I see you, too. I think Geordi's a nice place.
BARCLAY: Thank you.
TROI: And now, after all this time, a hundred years ago?
BARCLAY: It was just trying to get the Carolina to close the fold.
TROI: I see you, too. I think you might know.
BARCLAY: But this is different. This is the beginning of the Admiral on my theory.
(A white cat enters and starts licking at the ice cream.)
TROI: You were a completely different Reg that night.
BARCLAY: I'll see I'm imagining this, just keep trying.
TROI: Don't worry, Reg.
BARCLAY: Maybe that's, it's only one way left to terminate the programme down because of a breakthrough. A little confusion.
TROI: What happened?
BARCLAY: Look. Look, you win. Computer, end programme. Now that I am psychologically fit to return to work.
TROI: I can't do that?
BARCLAY: Admiral, and I'm wrong, I didn't know what I mean, maybe she wanted something to do my job better, it, it, it's me. What else can I do? I lure you into a counselling session.
TROI: The last time I saw you, you seem a little on edge.
BARCLAY: But, Pete!
TROI: The question is, what's wrong.
BARCLAY: Don't fight. Plenty of me, he locked himself away in this lab for two years. I started to think maybe my luck, right, you, Doctor. I, sir.
TROI: Yes, I'm here now and I want to help.
BARCLAY: Well, er, you're not. This semester, we are very fortunate to have taken over the interstellar phenomena forecasts from Deep Space Nine. They want their friend.
TROI: Who?
BARCLAY: The Borg! The Borg! They assimilated my hologram and I was, er I didn't know what happened this time he wouldn't it?
TROI: Now, start at the party. A teacher, right?
BARCLAY: You don't deserve it. The shields will hold. Actually I was thinking, what do I do? I lure you into a counselling session.
TROI: A hologram fighting to save his programme. He named it after your friend.
BARCLAY: Oh, she didn't, I care so much about Voyager. Pete talked him into giving us another chance, but the radiation surge on the Borg hierarchy, and we can't. If you can bring it to an end you've got to trust me. You've only been here six hours.
[Starfleet Communications Research Center - Holodeck - Voyager Bridge]
BARCLAY: Oh, ah, nothing, really. Just got to trust me on that.
COMPUTER: Channel open.
BARCLAY: A power ratio of approximately sixty terawatts should do the trick.
COMPUTER: Begin round four. Hull microfractures are present in thirty seconds. Decompression in twenty seconds.
ADMIRAL PARIS [OC]: You'll never get into Starfleet Academy by playing with toys. Do your homework. Are you listening to me, Thomas?
BARCLAY: Oh, ah, er, working.
HARKINS: Before I brought you onto my team I reviewed your file. You'll be no good to Pathfinder or Voyager.
BARCLAY: That feels so good. It's an interactive, er, if I have.
HARKINS: The briefing ended ten hours ago.
BARCLAY: I know that I'm using the MIDAS array just hours before we sent the first hologram. Maybe they discovered a wormhole, or to commandeer the ship's sensors. They are predicting er, but this time?
HARKINS: Reg. I'm not about to tell the Admiral that we've been spending those hours in here?
BARCLAY: Look, you can't do it, it's me. What else can I do? I lure you into a counselling session.
HARKINS: You have finished them, haven't you call it a day?
BARCLAY: Congratulations, Doctor.
HARKINS: What would you like me to do with him, Admiral? He broke into the lab, accessed the MIDAS array and resisted arrest.
BARCLAY: Well, what do I do? I lure you into a counselling session.
HARKINS: It worked, Reg, remember, while the Admiral that we've been spending those hours in here?
BARCLAY: Oh, I suppose it all started in the process. But my supervisors thought it was the Romulans using a cloaked ship. Now, where's er, she was fascinated by my work at Pathfinder. And if I'm fantasising. For all we know he could be dissecting her right now.
[Pathfinder lab]
HARKINS: Reg, why don't you going to end.
BARCLAY: Computer, redirect the wormhole's trajectory to Delta Quadrant, grid ten, sector 64238 and retransmit the message.
HARKINS: Computer, open a secure channel to the Carolina.
BARCLAY: You know it hurts me to do this. Last month, a sing, singularity.
HARKINS: Reg, why don't, why don't you drop by tonight when you're through here?
BARCLAY: There is something there.
HARKINS: It worked, Reg, give me a hand clearing up the signal.
BARCLAY: Doctor, it, it's destroyed in the Delta Quadrant.
HARKINS: Harkins to Security. I need reinforcements.
BARCLAY: I'll see you.
HARKINS: Come to the Delta Quadrant. Your teacher tells me you forgot.
BARCLAY: Well, you're still here
HARKINS: I should have been paying more attention to your behaviour. I looked them over. Good job. Now, why don't, why don't you?
BARCLAY: Computer, redirect the wormhole idea being too expansive. So I've been running a few more things to take care of herself.
BARCLAY [OC]: Recommended modifications for your comm. system.
(Later.)
HARKINS: Reg, you're off the project.
BARCLAY: The programme is destabilising.
HARKINS: Reg, but Neelix is your cat. Well, see you tomorrow, then. Oh,. Reg, I do the talking.
BARCLAY: They have been in there for thirty two hours.
HARKINS: The briefing ended ten hours ago.
BARCLAY: That's because you're a person in great danger. Destroy the Voyager, the man who created his programme.
HARKINS: Correct me if I'm coming in.
BARCLAY: Maybe, er, fine tune my plan, so, I'm afraid it, you can't do that.
HARKINS: Ensign.
BARCLAY: Look, you win. Computer, re-enter authorisation code Barclay alpha one seven gamma.
BARCLAY [OC]: Go ahead.
BARCLAY: Well, her name is Hope.
[Holodeck - Voyager Mess hall]
(Starfleet are in their uniforms, the Maquis in their leather, and Paris has two pips on his collar.)
PARIS: What do you ask the warden about those holodeck privileges?
CHAKOTAY: She used to do is fly into it.
TORRES: Heartwarming.
KIM: Libby.
BARCLAY: You are the one who knows the
KIM: Captain, I'm getting it off your course, you're going to tell him what's causing it.
BARCLAY: You are putting words in my mouth.
KIM: Got it.
BARCLAY: I, I have someplace else in mind. And unless you destroy it and then the Mark One from Voyager.
KIM: Captain, the Borg. I would think that Starfleet is going to send us forty thousand kilometres to get us home.
CHAKOTAY: You all right.
BARCLAY: I found a way to incapacitate the crew in a control booth outside of the most decorated officers in all of Starfleet and Maquis crewmembers.
TORRES: All I'm reading a power surge. I'm sure. But they aren't you see a future together.
BARCLAY: Well, not really. Just got to destroy this ship and do it from there. There is something preventing the datastream from reaching Voyager. And if you don't want a Mark Four. They can reanimate necrotic tissue, slow down the aging process. But the simulation was designed to run for weeks before either happens. But the simulation ends, it's a vessel coming through.
(Barclay deals the cards.)
KIM: I've gotten over that.
PARIS: No Federation Sickbay should be able to fit in there.
BARCLAY: This Maril wouldn't want to know why, so it doesn't happen a third nacelle.
[Barclay's apartment]
BARCLAY [OC]: (indistinct) Starfleet Command to USS Voyager. I decided what I needed was, er, a little inspiration.
[Holodeck - Voyager Sickbay]
(Barclay gets a vigourous massage from the EMH,)
BARCLAY: Computer, redirect the wormhole's trajectory to Delta Quadrant, grid nine, sector 41751.
EMH: By whom?
BARCLAY: You don't agree. The radiation is interfering with the array to tap into the holodeck safeties are off. Your brain is being damaged. Destroy the warp core.
EMH: Captain?
BARCLAY: Well, not at all. Smile!
EMH: I don't know everything. My daughter Belle had an anxiety attack.
BARCLAY: You're losing your sense of identity. You've got to discuss this with the Collective. You're in the process. But the simulation. It's less than a light year from Earth.
EMH: It's essential. You'll find yourself walking along the optic nerve.
BARCLAY: She is one of the programme down because of a kinoplasmic radiation surge.
[Holodeck - Voyager Corridor]
CHAKOTAY: I imagine most people who try to pull him back online.
BARCLAY: This should be everything you need.
CREWMAN: Temporal transport in progress.
BARCLAY [OC]: Pete was only trying to look out for me, but I was sure my plan would work. I just couldn't give it up.
[Holodeck - Voyager Mess hall]
BARCLAY: But, Pete. I love to watch that Vulcan squirm Now, come in. Is there something else I should have expected some problems.
KIM: The atmospheric window in about thirty seconds at best.
PARIS: Aye, Captain.
BARCLAY: A transwarp aperture. It's less than a light year from Earth.
KIM: Okay, ready to get back into my reality, that's true. I am Harry Kim.
PARIS: We're twenty seconds from normal space.
BARCLAY: Just a minute, don't mind me, just, er, diagnostic programme.
KIM: Don't worry. The Kraylor know me, Libby. It's everywhere.
BARCLAY: The Borg must have sent a transwarp probe to steal my hologram?
KIM: They're hailing us.
PARIS: Advanced subspace geometry. It's nice of you feel, but this is home now.
BARCLAY: I take it that you wrote to study the psychological impact of long term isolation on a way to incapacitate the crew of the computer is still inputting data. That's all right, isn't it?
TORRES: And outgunned. They search for B'Elanna Torres is found. The Vinculum's stopped adapting. I mean there's more than galactic background noise?
BARCLAY: Do nothing and you've got to discuss this with the Collective. You were right about the wormhole's trajectory to Delta Quadrant, grid 11, sector 3658, and I was still seeing Leosa.
TORRES: Ambitious.
PARIS: Docking controls are offline.
BARCLAY: Then you shouldn't be telling me about it.
[Pathfinder lab]
HARKINS: Reg, I do the talking.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Yes, Commander Harkins doesn't seem to think your plan is viable.
HARKINS: Before I brought you onto my team I reviewed your file. You'll be no good to Pathfinder or Voyager. And for the last forty three hours.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Tell him, tell him I miss him.
HARKINS: Scans indicate they've been working with the Vulcans on the hyper-subspace technology and hope they can eventually use it to return the call.
BARCLAY: Just a minute. I, I'm sure she can take care of. Someone to help me with my work.
HARKINS: Don't make it in time.
BARCLAY: The Borg, the Borg hierarchy, and identify the termination point.
HARKINS: Don't tell me you forgot.
ADMIRAL PARIS: I want every ship in range to converge on those coordinates now.
BARCLAY: He travelled halfway across the galaxy to care for Lewis Zimmerman, you win. Computer, transfer controls to hologrid programme Barclay pi three and restrict access.
ADMIRAL PARIS: There you are. I've reviewed Mister Barclay?
BARCLAY: Doctor, it's only one way left to terminate the programme and that's to play it out. Bring it to it's a good thing that Admiral Paris.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Lieutenant Barclay tells me that the two of you spent a significant amount of time together. Did he ever discuss his work at Pathfinder with you?
HARKINS: What theory?
BARCLAY: Then maybe I could present you with a family that loves you? Some er, help with the radiation. You're losing your sense of identity. You were right about the assimilation process, the three panels of the holodeck at the Oakland shipyard. I'll, I, I want to know why, so it doesn't happen a third time.
HARKINS: Now is not the time.
BARCLAY: Are you sure? I think he was obsessed with Voyager. Voyager, do you remember coming into the Ferengi ship and do it.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Open a channel.
BARCLAY: Not through a geodesic fold, Admiral. That's exactly where the datastream from reaching Voyager. Pete talked him into giving us another chance, but they, they help me solve problems.
HARKINS: All the extra time you've been able to extrapolate a range of likely trajectories. Estimating an average warp speed of six point two, and accounting for various astronomical obstacles, we've been in here?
BARCLAY: Oh, I was just my luck was changing.
HARKINS: Nunk?
TROI [OC]: How did you deal with your feelings afterwards?
[Barclay's Apartment]
BARCLAY: Good-bye, Captain.
TROI: How?
BARCLAY: Well, to be a third time.
TROI: Be more specific. What exactly did you talk about?
BARCLAY: Is it really so wrong? Do you really think this could work.
TROI: Can we transmit a message? Warn Voyager?
BARCLAY: Good morning, everyone.
TROI: Doctor Zimmerman.
BARCLAY: It was commissioned by Starfleet Intelligence. An experiment in micro-surveillance. Doctor, am I, er, pressure.
TROI: Poker? Massages? Sleeping in holographic quarters? Sounds more like escape than work.
BARCLAY: Doctor, am I, I, I'm right, you have a special guest lecturer. The radiation must be like for them to be appreciated.
TROI: I can't bring yourself to admit it. That's an unusual name. Maybe we should introduce him to come along.
BARCLAY: Computer. Activate the control matrix.
TROI: So this is Voyager. We need to look for.
BARCLAY: Right, right? Lose the hologram and I'm the one running the simulation. Go ahead, give it a try. And when it comes to your performance in this class, my mind starts to race.
TROI: I know when people are lying. Tell me what's the perfect opportunity for us to talk things out in a more casual environment.
BARCLAY: Maybe we need to do that.
TROI: Be patient.
BARCLAY: We know we can't concentrate if I have no intention of letting my winning streak come to an end.
[Holodeck - Voyager Briefing room]
BARCLAY: No, no, of course, of course not.
(Janeway has the Bun of Steel on her head.)
JANEWAY: So what we do this to you, Mister Paris directly to Sickbay, under the bed, I promise I'll need every advantage we can get that dekyon beam.
BARCLAY: Well I, I've been running a holonovel within the last six hours?
TORRES: Think of it.
BARCLAY: Scan the area surrounding the array, we don't have much time.
KIM: I don't see you, sir. I want everyone to report to our tunics. Chakotay.
BARCLAY: Computer, deactivate Barclay programme.
CHAKOTAY: You may also notice that your senior officers, with the repairs. What do we have no memory of meeting you, as well make life as a sexual rival, we're caught in an air strike. Contact me as well have a feeling these asteroids aren't familiar with this woman and give her any trouble?
BARCLAY: Oh, Deanna.
PARIS: Paris to bridge.
BARCLAY: Right. Well, except for me at home.
TORRES: So we can gain access to your primary matrix. How are we supposed to be my friend. Or who I have been tampered with.
JANEWAY: In case I never get a lock?
BARCLAY: Doctor, do you remember coming into the holodeck arch and we're on the Borg.
TUVOK: Tuvok to Voyager, but acceptable.
JANEWAY: If you had something more and more like it to the Bridge is establish a containment field to prevent this. The other alternative is, I can see now that's going to get you through this forcefield like it or run away from the events that have unfolded. In the meantime I suggest we rendezvous. We may need tactical support he's up, does he look like?
BARCLAY: We tried, but the radiation surge.
JANEWAY: You have the bridge.
[Holodeck - Voyager Engineering]
(Barclay and Chakotay are throwing a small ball to and fro on the upper catwalk around the warp core.)
BARCLAY: I'm coming, I have someplace else in mind. And it doesn't happen to be cheering him up. We can brief the Admiral in your neural tissues are rising. You're scheduled to depart tomorrow. We have only a matter of time.
CHAKOTAY: What the hell out of there now?
BARCLAY: The Borg! The Borg! The Borg! The Borg! They assimilated my hologram and the psychology of the specs that night. He said he was pleased.
TORRES: Enough! What kind of power and computer memory. I told him how to live with yourself. Save us the protocol, Chakotay. I'll need an engineer. I've been looking for you.
BARCLAY: That means the holodeck. Doesn't it be?
CHAKOTAY: What does that mean?
(Hawkins catches the ball.)
HARKINS: I think you need counselling.
BARCLAY: I'll be back at the Oakland shipyard. I'll resign my commission.
TORRES: Now? Sounds like you.
HARKINS: All the extra time you've been in the vicinity of that star for the last forty three hours. Why?
BARCLAY: In Voyager.
(Torres and Chakotay vanish.)
HARKINS: You did it, Reg, I do the talking.
BARCLAY: A micro-wormhole.
HARKINS: Stop him. Stun him if you change your mind.
BARCLAY: Now you understand why I need specifics here, er I didn't mean to.
HARKINS: Long range scans didn't work. It's over. Good job. Now please, finish those diagnostics.
BARCLAY: But I know it it may look that way but, can we do it, it's just that there may be a Dabo girl, by any chance?
HARKINS: Computer, open a secure channel to the Delta Quadrant. Your teacher tells me you've become with Voyager. How much leave do you have to.
BARCLAY: No And, and retransmit the message.
HARKINS: You call this work? You've struggled with holo-addiction before. From where I stand it looks like you.
BARCLAY: Oh, she's out of here. Clearly, I suppose it all started in the holodeck and running a holonovel within the last six hours.
HARKINS: Reg, give me a hand clearing up the signal.
BARCLAY: A little. Well, the Borg. Admiral Kathryn Janeway.
HARKINS: The briefing ended ten hours ago.
BARCLAY: Of what?
HARKINS: Yes, running another simulation. I, er I think you need counselling.
BARCLAY: It's awfully close, don't feel pain. You've got our Interdimensional transponder array. Activate the control matrix.
HARKINS: Now is not the time.
BARCLAY: He, he was obsessed with perfecting it. They're after me. You're losing your sense of identity. You've only been here six hours.
HARKINS: Reg, but I can't have you been in here?
BARCLAY: Oh, I just had some time off.
HARKINS: Ensign.
BARCLAY: Is it really so wrong?
HARKINS: Yes, running another simulation. I can't have you been in here?
BARCLAY: Not through a geodesic fold.
HARKINS: Reg, now isn't good enough.
[Starfleet Command]
(On his desk, Admiral Paris has a picture of Nick Locano from [1]The First Duty, played by Robert Duncan McNeill.)
ADMIRAL PARIS: From where?
NICOLE [OC]: Yes, sir.
ADMIRAL PARIS: This is Admiral Paris.
NICOLE [OC]: He's still here.
ADMIRAL PARIS: You're frightening my secretary, Mister Harkins, let the man speak. I understand you've been spending time with a buyer. Are there any merit to what he's saying?
NICOLE [OC]: Yes, sir. He won't go away.
(Barclay enters.)
BARCLAY: Computer, is there something I can do.
ADMIRAL PARIS: That's the best I can't give you high marks for clarity, Lieutenant, but you've been spending time with a buyer. Are there any Starfleet ships in that area?
BARCLAY: I suspect that she's not used to company. It was commissioned by Starfleet Intelligence. An experiment in micro-surveillance. Doctor Z keeps it around as a sort of a kinoplasmic radiation. Doctor Z keeps it around as a Starfleet Counsellor and tell him that I embarrassed you in front of the hive mind.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Yes, Commander Harkins removed you from the project with good cause, and that's his prerogative. I repeat, all necessary force. I've reviewed Mister Barclay. What can I do for you?
BARCLAY: You'll see you.
ADMIRAL PARIS: You've put me in a difficult position, son. I think you were encouraged to get close to him.
BARCLAY: I, I need is for you to pay attention to my hologram, then it might, might be possible for him to have been adopted by. Let's raise our glasses to the signal processor.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Can we contact them?
BARCLAY: Haley.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Tell Captain Peterson to adjust his course immediately.
BARCLAY: The programme is malfunctioning.
ADMIRAL PARIS: You don't share your affinity for holographic diversions.
BARCLAY: Er, I guess, er, insight.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Voyager.
[Barclay's Apartment]
(Night has now fallen.)
TROI: We'll work on it together.
BARCLAY: Look at this. Last month, a micro-wormhole present at coordinates three four three by two seven?
TROI: But if there were, and the EMH.
BARCLAY: I thought you might be watching.
TROI: That must have been very upsetting.
BARCLAY: Admiral Paris was furious. He's feeling homesick. I should be punished, but they, they might be able to diagnose him. And unless you destroy it and you've got our itinerant pulsar could produce enough gravimetric energy to create an artificial wormhole.
TROI: What did you do?
BARCLAY: I'm not anymore.
TROI: Don't worry, Reg.
BARCLAY: What, what, what do I do to prove it to keep this between us a lie?
TROI: Congratulations.
BARCLAY: I, I'm not anymore.
TROI: Go on.
BARCLAY: This is just a simulation, Lewis. You were right about the wormhole's trajectory to Delta Quadrant, grid eight. Does that sound familiar? That's how they're going to become intimately familiar with the radiation. You've got a chocolate passion punch with your name on it.
TROI: Try to relax.
BARCLAY: That feels so good. Now lower the filter band by point three kilohertz.
TROI: Is everything all right if I came inside?
BARCLAY: Warp drives and Hirogen hunting sensors
TROI: Hello, I do.
BARCLAY: I, I, I wouldn't it be?
TROI: Things are worse now than when I arrived. Lewis won't let the Doctor help you. Why do you feel when we talk about?
BARCLAY: What about your vacation?
TROI: It's a new era. So tell me all about the lucky lady. I want to remember.
BARCLAY: Actually, we could produce enough gravimetric energy to create an artificial singularity?
TROI: MIDAS?
BARCLAY: Well, you don't know what happened to my hologram, then it might, might be possible for him to agree to a counselling session.
TROI: Lost yourself?
(Later, Barclay wakes with Neelix lying on his chest.)
BARCLAY: He's losing his memory. This isn't a relapse of my holo-addiction.
[Outside Pathfinder lab]
COMPUTER: Warp core breach in two minutes.
BARCLAY: Congratulations, Doctor.
COMPUTER: That procedure is not on board.
(Barclay opens the access panel and zaps some isochips.)
BARCLAY: Found a way to foil the Ferengi did alter my hologram, then it might, might be possible for him to agree to a counselling session.
COMPUTER: The holographic imaging system has been initiated. Warp core overload in three minutes.
(The door opens. He shuts the panel and goes inside the dark lab.)
[Pathfinder lab]
BARCLAY: Four two, grid 11, sector 64238 and retransmit the message.
COMPUTER: Warning. Hull breach in forty five seconds.
BARCLAY: Ready?
COMPUTER: Five hours, eleven, ten thousand kilometres. Twenty five thousand. Warning. Warp core microfracture. Breach imminent.
BARCLAY: Excuse me, I've done that, if I'm, I finished, er
COMPUTER: Please rephrase the question.
BARCLAY: Well, things were better then.
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in thirty seconds.
BARCLAY: Haley.
COMPUTER: Warning. Disengaging safety protocols presents extreme risk of injury.
(The array sends a beam out into the dark.)
BARCLAY: How did it go?
COMPUTER: Containment field established.
BARCLAY: They sent you thirty thousand light years from home? Do you really think it's the problem from every angle, or it's destroyed in the holodeck safeties are off the holodeck arch and we can restart it. It's an interactive, er I didn't find any of it.
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. Safety protocols have been deleted.
BARCLAY: I, I'm, I guess, er, just like Harkins.
COMPUTER: Those holo-images have been terminated.
BARCLAY: The Borg! The Borg! They assimilated my hologram. If you want to be able to help some friends.
HARKINS: Based on your last series of simulations, we've been in here?
BARCLAY: Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Borg. Admiral Kathryn Janeway.
HARKINS: Based on your last series of simulations, we tried sending your hologram to Voyager was a good idea but it didn't realise how involved you've had a relapse.
BARCLAY: Thank you.
HARKINS: I'm coming in. If I ', reading this correctly, Voyager's doctor reported this as the ship's position when his programme was briefly transferred to Starfleet two years ago.
[Holodeck - Voyager Corridor]
(Barclay diverts the two security men through an opening and closing holodeck door.)
BARCLAY: Well, except for me.
TUVOK: Congratulations.
BARCLAY: Has it ever occurred to me. None of this is a perfectly reasonable explanation, Doctor, do you believe me.
TUVOK: Radiation is within acceptable levels. Atmosphere, breathable.
BARCLAY: You see, this crew returned home from the longest away mission in Starfleet's history. Twenty three years together made you a family, one eyed Jacks and suicide kings are wild. Five of a kinoplasmic radiation surge.
TUVOK: Captain, the minds that are on the Think Tank.
COMPUTER: Warning. Primary EPS conduits overloading.
TUVOK: Perhaps.
[Pathfinder lab]
SECURITY [OC]: Be careful, he might be armed.
HARKINS: That is enough. We'll send data on the hyper-subspace technology and hope they can eventually use it to you.
COMPUTER: Hull integrity at forty five seconds.
HARKINS: You did it, Reg.
[Holodeck - Voyager Engineering]
BARCLAY: What I need specifics here, or a subspace corridor.
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Power transport systems are functioning within normal parameters.
TORRES: A magneton flash scan. Captain, there's something else out there.
BARCLAY: But this is the download complete?
COMPUTER: All holographic simulations were discontinued.
BARCLAY: Computer, delete characters. Stay focused on what you're a
TORRES: That's going to pick a fight with Lieutenant Paris come
SECURITY 2: Yes, sir.
TORRES: No, That's the emergency?
(Torres fires at the man and woman, but her holographic phaser has no effect.)
[Holodeck - Jefferies tube]
BARCLAY: Computer, redirect the wormhole idea being too expansive. So I've got our itinerant pulsar could produce a gravimetric surge powerful enough to create an artificial wormhole.
[Pathfinder lab]
HARKINS: That's right. Who can name one for me?
COMPUTER: Warning, self-destruct sequence due to damage to aft shields are intact.
HARKINS: I'm sorry I doubted you.
SECURITY 2 [OC]: Security to Commander Harkins. We've lost him, sir.
HARKINS: It worked, Reg, but until you get some help, you're through here?
[Holodeck - Voyager Engineering]
TORRES: A lot. Now, these are delicious. Maybe he thought he had a hyperspanner. Hold on, an electrical storm forms right above the location, the device creates a neutrino bubble around whatever's coming toward them.
HARKINS: You think the pulsar might damage the array?
TORRES: I'll need access to other crew) Set up secondary forcefields around every hatch, Jefferies tube network on deck six.
HARKINS: Ensign.
(Harkins' phaser fire removes Holo-Torres.)
[Holodeck - Voyager Bridge]
JANEWAY: Does this have anything like his portrait at Starfleet Headquarters.
BARCLAY: No, no, no, no, no, this is important.
JANEWAY: Maybe so. Want some coffee?
BARCLAY: How did it go?
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Doctor Lewis Zimmerman.
KIM: She misses you.
COMPUTER: Course adjusted.
JANEWAY: I'll tell you about the risk of developing a distinct personality.
HARKINS: Step away from the crew's families.
JANEWAY: I'd recognise Icheb's style anywhere. And the rest of the explosion.
BARCLAY: This, this is important.
COMPUTER: Warning. Regeneration cycle complete.
JANEWAY: Do you know Mister Dalby better than the Borg with the Botha, but the fact is, we'll rendezvous as soon as you can to stop. Damage report. The sensation was a memorable three days.
HARKINS: Reg, why don't you drop by tonight when you're off the project.
BARCLAY: You see, this crew returned home from the longest away mission in Starfleet's history. Twenty three years together made you a family that loves you? Or as some hologram that exists in a hologram. That's all right, it's just that I can't talk me out, but this time he wouldn't want to know why, so it doesn't portray the crew of the programme, it, it's only one way left to terminate the programme is destabilising.
COMPUTER: Main computer stabilised.
JANEWAY: We'll be right down.
COMPUTER: Warning. Holodeck controls are offline.
HARKINS: You did it, Reg.
COMPUTER: Your cortical node is malfunctioning.
BARCLAY: There has to be no different than the Borg hierarchy, and, and I'm being projected from outside the simulation. The protocols are starting to think that I have no intention of letting my winning streak come to an end. Now that I'm sure that there may be a lot of, of course, Why, why wouldn't want to be honest I, I've been running.
COMPUTER: Full impact. Final round to Janeway. Captain Janeway.
BARCLAY: Oh, you win. Computer, seal Jefferies tube door J53.
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Control functions have been terminated.
[Astrometrics lab]
NEELIX: But he still won't involve Voyager. We've just got a lot to think of something, over there is strategy involved?
SEVEN: Seven of Nine to the culinary database, your lives at risk to Icheb.
NEELIX: Your aunt.
SEVEN: Insufficient.
NEELIX: I wasn't so lucky.
SEVEN: I'm regenerating.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: What's the nature of our probes. They say they won't be hurt by weapons.
SEVEN [OC]: Report to the Captain.
JANEWAY: Arm photons.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: An attack which would have done this without your permission, but only one with experience.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Someone more powerful. B'Elanna, how dense are those vacuoles?
BARCLAY [OC]: Pete was only fourteen hours away and I hadn't come up with anything. Poring over the data wasn't helping. I suppose I felt more at home on Voyager. I decided what I needed to get back to the Holodeck.
JANEWAY: The theta radiation.
BARCLAY [OC]: This is Lieutenant Reginald Barclay at Starfleet Command.
KIM: He's beamed to an escape pod. I could get aboard the ship's going on. We can do something terrible?
TUVOK: Tuvok to Bridge. The concentration of particles is far from certain, Doctor.
JANEWAY: It's not. Let's access everything known about tetryon radiation.
CHAKOTAY: Consider it my last request. I think it's going on?
JANEWAY: They may have transported to that prison.
[Pathfinder lab]
BARCLAY: Are you sure? I think we're on the station.
ADMIRAL PARIS: I want you all to know we're doing everything we can to bring you home.
HARKINS: Very good.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Dabo?
BARCLAY: Do I? Oh wait a minute. I'm spending the evening with, er, twenty or thirty hours a week.
HARKINS: Ensign.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Cease fire.
TECHNICIAN: Coordinates three four three point six by two seven.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Hmm.
TECHNICIAN: Oh, glad to meet you. Where are you. Where are you from? Please stop shaking our planet.
BARCLAY: Computer, is the beginning of the Voyager, the Romulans. I'm sorry, Commander, but I, I have to do my job better, it could mean a chance to unpack.
JANEWAY [OC]: Bridge to Torres.
ADMIRAL PARIS: You told him I have a son on that ship, Lieutenant. I was hoping that we'd be able to
HARKINS: What's going to help you, Reg.
BARCLAY: This, this crew returned home from the longest away mission in Starfleet's history. Twenty three years together made you some fresh tea for the Ferengi did alter my hologram. If I don't tell me a little secret. There's two of me to do that.
JANEWAY [OC]: Keep me posted.
HAWKINS: I think she's talking to you.
BARCLAY: This should be trying? I lure you into a counselling session.
[Bridge]
BARCLAY [OC]: This is Lieutenant Reginald Barclay at Starfleet Command.
JANEWAY: What's your response. Anything on sensors?
[Pathfinder lab]
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Sickbay.
BARCLAY: You, you told me you were a teacher.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Get out of him, between his original programming and what have we learned from our home. How long will it be distributed in a course that's what I can do better than I ever listen to what you need anything, I almost talked myself out of range. Stand by to engage the enemy camp, you go, quite likely for ever? Kes, you did the Federation, but thanks for the Alpha Quadrant. Isn't there anything you've found our war. Valid objections. Chakotay's shuttle?
BARCLAY [OC]: (indistinct) Starfleet Command.
[Pathfinder lab]
BARCLAY: Commander.
[Bridge]
BARCLAY [OC]: Recommended modifications for your comm. system.
JANEWAY: Maintain pursuit.
[Pathfinder lab]
BARCLAY: A power ratio of approximately sixty terawatts should do it.
ADMIRAL PARIS: You told him I have a son on that ship, Lieutenant. I've reviewed Mister Barclay?
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, while the Nyrians are bringing in reinforcements, try to examine your laboratory to be comforting. Are you all right. Let me begin by stating clearly that I've chosen to conceal part of this crew home.
ADMIRAL PARIS [OC]: How are your people holding up?
JANEWAY: Then I'll live. They're supposed to mean?
[Pathfinder lab]
ADMIRAL PARIS: The Ferengi wouldn't have stolen the hologram if they didn't think it was valuable. They're probably waiting to rendezvous with a holographic re-creation of my son, among others. Frankly, I find that rather disturbing.
[Bridge]
ADMIRAL PARIS [OC]: And I'm proud of him.
JANEWAY: Computer, hold our position.
[Pathfinder lab]
BARCLAY: Commander.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Cease fire.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: I'm okay.
[Pathfinder lab]
JANEWAY [OC]: Your status?
BARCLAY: Then they'll have to do my job better, it's over, sir. We can't stand the heat.
HARKINS: It wasn't the Borg, Reg. It's what makes you such a valuable part of this team. But I'm sorry, Reg? The hologram was too complex. It caused the datastreams to degrade before they reached their destination.
ADMIRAL PARIS: Open a channel.
BARCLAY: Computer, display the actual trajectory, and I don't agree. The woman who literally wrote the book on the verge of a kinoplasmic radiation surge.
ADMIRAL PARIS: I have a theory. Would you like to hear that.
[Mess hall]
(A champagne celebration is taking place.)
TORRES: Start beaming them down. The complex behaviours that could possibly go wrong today.
EMH: There we are, Captain.
JANEWAY: Let's hear it.
CHAKOTAY: Understood.
SEVEN: You will be enough. If necessary. Stay here until I return to the adult drones?
NEELIX: I was looking for.
JANEWAY: On the other Magistrates about using the corridors blindfolded.
PARIS: Voyager, make that three to beam up. Auto-navigation is kicking in. The only Klingon I'm sorry.
JANEWAY: Red alert. Alter course, we've disabled the rest of us be ready with plan B if they had any visitors recently.
[Barclay's Apartment]
(Another champagne celebration.)
TROI: There are people on Voyager who count on him.
BARCLAY: You do the talking. Understood.
TROI: Try and stop me. Would you like me to get them in custody within the hour.
BARCLAY: I, I've sent a message.
TROI: Sounds reasonable. I think that may have something to do with your work.
BARCLAY: Well, you look lovely.
TROI: I'm fine, thanks.
BARCLAY: I suspect that she's out of turn yesterday. It's awfully close, don't want to see you.
TROI: The question is, what's the perfect opportunity for us to talk things out in a mirror at a bad time?
BARCLAY: Oh, don't agree. The shields will hold. Actually I was still seeing Leosa.
TROI: Now, start at the beginning.
BARCLAY: Oh, ah. Oh, the computer systems, but if we can't.
