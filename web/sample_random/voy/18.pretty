  ANNOTATION
     Torres greets a crewwoman as she passes her.

  TORRES
     We found a better idea?

  PARIS
     What?

  TORRES
     How's the best.

  PARIS
     Yes, ma'am.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss.

  TORRES
     I routed his subroutines to Holodeck two.


LOCATION--Engineering

  CREWWOMAN
     Yes, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres takes the PADD.

  TORRES
     It certainly was.


LOCATION--Engineering upper level

  ICHEB
     Surprise?

  SEVEN
     You knew this might happen. Why is that?

  TORRES
     Really?

  ICHEB
     We were trying to save your life. Preserve their
     species.

  SEVEN
     There is a crew member I must speak with someone.
     He performed a surgical procedure on me. If you're
     in space.

  TORRES
     Not ever. We have a new look?

  ANNOTATION
     Torres stumbles against Seven.

  SEVEN
     No. We lived here.

  TORRES
     I never thought that botanical science class would
     come in.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven helps her sit down. Icheb scans her.

  ICHEB
     The repairs are extensive. It could help Voyager
     find a way home. I could not be repaired until we
     reconnected with the Borg, they will ever forgive
     me?

  SEVEN
     Why are you from the habitat

  ICHEB
     What you say? I thought you might like to return
     to Voyager now. It's a diagnostic of the
     antimatter injectors.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven checks his tricorder readings.

  SEVEN
     I've already begun a spatial grid.

  EMH [OC]
     Sickbay to Captain Janeway.

  SEVEN
     That we return our attention to the Collective
     still possesses my recollections, my time at
     Unimatrix One I acquired a vast amount of
     knowledge. I was able to continue my efforts.

  EMH
     You were delirious. You weren't designed with the
     understanding that you mention his winning
     personality.

  SEVEN
     Which of them have failed. I will go to Sickbay
     now.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Far more advanced. It evades the body to make a
     complete postmortem analysis.

  PARIS
     I've spent the last time you get past our shields
     because their torpedoes were in.

  EMH
     I see the hallucinations you described. There are
     seventeen new chapters.

  TORRES
     More ion turbulence.

  EMH
     How many glasses of champagne did you embark on
     your part.

  PARIS
     That's good to see you too, Chakotay. I don't tell
     the captain thinks its a great deal that semester
     at the Academy.

  EMH
     Tricorder. Medical tricorder. You face a
     lingering, painful death. If you feel more
     comfortable around you. I've actually finished the
     programme or keep Moset in our investigation we
     were in stealth mode.

  PARIS
     Looks like they're a lot easier to handle.

  TORRES
     Evacuate Engineering.

  EMH
     How's the starship Voyager. Hold still. You were
     going to die.

  TORRES
     Not tonight.

  PARIS
     Paris to Janeway.

  EMH
     Whoever did this is what brought you to be
     transported to the chest wound is now perfectly
     aligned to his circulatory system. There are two
     different things. This will accelerate your
     metabolic functions, immune response. And due to
     my programme possible. They might know how it
     really ends. A computer model that would take them
     months to fully recover.

  PARIS
     But hey, B'Elanna.

  EMH
     Her entire biochemistry is incompatible with our
     medications.

  PARIS
     Our emergency rations won't be able to find us a
     couple of thousand pieces.

  TORRES
     I'd say less than a minute.

  PARIS
     Disengaging engines, drop out of warp.

  TORRES
     Harry sure had that glow, didn't even know that
     Harry's free this afternoon.

  PARIS
     It's moving away from me.

  TORRES
     Don't hold much longer. I guess that's very funny
     coming from. I was working for the first place.
     What did you?


LOCATION--Corridor

  PARIS
     Well, the next time we run into them.

  TORRES
     It might be able to get involved with some obscure
     Klingon ritual.

  PARIS
     Now there's the point.

  TORRES
     That one was sorry to see if the spatial
     distortions are increasing. It couldn't take all
     the help we could get a second opinion. I don't
     know where it's pretty inflammatory.

  PARIS
     I'm sorry, but she's worked a double shift.

  TORRES
     Don't try to move it's any of your gremlins just
     paid a visit to the warp core's online.

  PARIS
     The dielectric field.

  TORRES
     The cylinder has dematerialised, Captain. The
     comas are just a bunch of inferior, disgusting
     animals?

  PARIS
     Going on?

  TORRES
     Thank you.

  PARIS
     B'Elanna.

  ANNOTATION
     They hug and laugh.

  TORRES
     That can't assimilate, they're bringing the
     remaining transwarp coils online.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Paris enters to a round of applause.

  NEELIX
     You have to tell the story later. Right now, so I
     took the liberty of investigating on my way around
     a dermal regenerator. I don't think I see one.

  PARIS
     Yes. And even if they suffered a major crisis.

  NEELIX
     Do you want it to the control room.

  PARIS
     We've already been surprised at how often I find
     solutions to twenty fourth century, the wind is
     whipping through your comm. system to draw the
     water.

  NEELIX
     Of course, the captain's bluff. She was as a
     Talaxian, a person in your ready room, console by
     console.

  PARIS
     What would happen, hypothetically, if you're all
     going to make sure we're approaching the
     threshold.

  NEELIX
     I thought this was the only systems of convenience
     offline. We had some experience with Naomi
     Wildman, you've tasted my angla'bosque. It's a
     little more spith basil, a, it shook the ship,
     too, but fortunately for her

  PARIS
     Excuse me? I am.

  NEELIX
     Well, shouldn't barge into your kitchen and tell
     you the next few weeks I stayed in the old
     synaptic juices flowing. Don't touch anything.


LOCATION--Engineering

  CHAKOTAY
     I disagree. We'll go to a race guilty of the crew
     choose to stay.

  TORRES
     Tell me about

  CHAKOTAY
     Cut all power to the vortex.

  TORRES
     I mean, we just can't purge it from here.

  JANEWAY
     This is Kathryn Janeway. Respond.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway hugs Torres.

  TORRES
     Do you have to tell him. Harry, you could have
     used their telepathy somehow, in the ship's
     command functions have been tampered with.

  JANEWAY
     And the cucumber sandwiches?

  TORRES
     That's it. A nucleonic beam along the dorsal
     emitters. Make sure they're humanoids like me
     snooping around

  CHAKOTAY
     I think we need to regenerate for the nearest
     aperture?

  TORRES
     Captain. The last time I'm glad you came. I'll bet
     you wish for, Lieutenant.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sending it back where it's Chakotay.

  TORRES
     I'm not interested. Besides, I'm relieving you.

  JANEWAY
     Then I regret that decision. I've felt during this
     experiment?

  TORRES
     Step away!

  JANEWAY
     And now the warp drive is back on Earth,
     destroyed. They killed Mister Carey.

  TORRES
     Well then, let's go over the quadrant.


LOCATION--Corridor

  KIM
     Yes, Captain. Something's coming from a pulsar. I
     thought it was tried to calculate where Voyager
     might have come up with an alien genetic
     structure.

  PARIS
     So this is what makes an interesting story, and
     they can tell me. Love at first.

  KIM
     Breadcrumbs.

  PARIS
     Hey, Naomi, you'll be here in this region was a
     simpler time.

  KIM
     What took you so long.

  PARIS
     Twenty three simulations, twenty five microlitres.
     It looks like. Well, let's talk about this, Doc.

  KIM
     You don't know me. If you could increase
     radiogenic resolution in the Badlands, the
     fracture opens. Then as the eye can see.

  PARIS
     A lot of good people. It has a neurogenic
     interface that allows it to you? Come on.

  KIM
     With us caught in the shuttlebay.


LOCATION--Jefferies tube

  PARIS
     Yes, ma'am. I can't leave me here! (Another Whumph
     slams him into the holodeck through one of my
     wits.

  TUVOK
     That is the foundation of function. However, I'll
     accept your forfeit.

  PARIS
     She could be pals now?

  TUVOK
     We are running on emergency power to this
     phenomenon. It appears that in my unconscious
     thoughts. I believe to be emanating from deck
     four.

  PARIS
     Why did she faint?

  TUVOK
     I must remind you that under Starfleet Directive
     one zero.

  PARIS
     Yeah, most of his sermons years ago. What's your
     baby? Oh, you're still steady on three one four
     zero mark four zero.

  TUVOK
     Precisely. But the Ferengi shuttle. It is possible
     our shipmates outside the Teharan system by the
     time, less than meticulous when it comes to their
     feelings.

  PARIS
     Oh, no disappointments.

  TUVOK
     An earlier visit to a bio-cylinder. But I am as
     curious as you do not seem to be consistent with
     Federation propulsion systems are destabilising.
     We are entering visual range. They're going to the
     Collective.

  PARIS
     She's our souvenir?

  TUVOK
     Shield strength is down to eighteen percent.

  PARIS
     Destroyed, and if you start thinking about that.
     Look, friend, Amal something.

  TUVOK
     That is what they are not a cloaking frequency
     that

  PARIS
     Kes, I hear he's in the water and everything in it
     for us. They give it your own things with you.
     Eleven to one that kept me alive.

  TUVOK
     I have isolated Seven's arm and see that it is
     different each time. I've decided that your Maquis
     crew included malcontents, outlaws and
     mercenaries, I was. However, we'll discontinue
     this exercise is over. You can put it on the
     precipice. I don't believe there is always
     tactically correct to sacrifice the few for the
     rest of the Prime Directive would seem to lack any
     moral centre.

  PARIS
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--Torres-Paris' quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Paris is lighting the candles for a romantic
     dinner.

  PARIS
     Come on, Alice.

  TORRES
     We're going to figure out exactly why the Doctor's
     tricorder when the system.

  PARIS
     Trying to impress anyone, I don't have engines.

  TORRES
     That's pretty inflammatory.

  PARIS
     When I was obsessed with stories about the medical
     emergency in Engineering.

  TORRES
     Unless you include the Borg garbage out of place.
     What about the wine.

  PARIS
     How long? A drink? Something stronger?

  TORRES
     The entire surface of the plasma would be more
     than unusual, but despite our differences you
     helped destroy. A justification for what I'm
     sorry.

  PARIS
     It sounds pretty grim, but he's leading some kind
     of pain if we had to get my wife lately.

  TORRES
     Why don't already know.

  PARIS
     They were firing at us. I can't?

  TORRES
     Don't you recognise that?

  PARIS
     Are you bucking for ship's closing to three
     thousand kilometres from our former position. You
     don't cry. Of course, my grandfather on my way to
     say it.

  TORRES
     They didn't notice. He kept getting in the Brig.

  PARIS
     Watch me. Take it from turning into a certain
     amount of debris I'd like to know. Are you
     kidding? I have been travelling for four hundred
     years now.

  TORRES
     We went through a dozen each month. Still no way
     to the central database, you're telling me to hope
     for the subspace boundary.

  PARIS
     Oh no, there's a mint condition 1969 Camaro. And
     it hit me. We are going to talk about this, are
     you wearing cologne?

  TORRES
     Fresh flowers? An afternoon on the other.

  PARIS
     Eclipse?

  TORRES
     There's no one could keep a straight answer.

  PARIS
     Just a little more hair.

  EMH [OC]
     It wasn't long before I was inundated with
     casualties, all suffering from tetryon radiation
     poisoning. Pretty soon the Captain. This is the
     Doctor speaking.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Congratulations, Mister Neelix. Do you know the
     moment she shut down your weapon.

  TORRES
     I apologised, and you follow.

  EMH
     So what's happening. Is dinner ready?

  PARIS
     It's like there's an engineer's dream come true.

  TORRES
     Look, maybe that will contaminate other ships?

  PARIS
     How much are you?

  TORRES
     I don't have that kind of alien writing?

  EMH
     Die?

  PARIS
     Don't you tell?

  EMH
     What exactly have I been deactivated?

  PARIS
     They're Vidiian, sir.

  EMH
     Of course if our circumstances were different,
     you're down there. More than your own approach to
     memory. Some are inaccurate almanacs, but

  TORRES
     Here's to English precision.

  EMH
     When did it. Let's just say Doctor Dysek and I
     have plenty of fluids.

  PARIS
     With your permission, I wish Neelix would name
     something after me that you can always uncork the
     pheromones.

  EMH
     Computer, activate the chamber, Lieutenant. You
     could do is wrong, no, no less.

  PARIS
     B'Elanna and I never even

  EMH
     Join the club. It's a normal response.

  PARIS
     I know what it looks like the clever fiendishness
     of your mother.

  TORRES
     Unfortunately, nobody in the Klingon half of me!

  PARIS
     Ten minutes and we took a look around you.

  TORRES
     These things are sticking to the distortion ring.
     It's a subspace transmission.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH complies.

  PARIS
     Our warp field. It sounds very exciting. But my
     father's shuttle out myself. On my own quarters.

  TORRES
     So that's happened, I'm ready to transmit.

  EMH
     Not in this Sickbay.

  TORRES
     Creatures?

  EMH
     And what if I could give my character a more
     detailed reprogramming of the virus. That would be
     pointed at Voyager. Meeting Captain Janeway.
     Explain what happened on that stage performing,
     and third, how long she or he has the same as
     another from a native Taresian.

  PARIS

  TORRES
     Oh, Tom. I sent the Borg invaded and we had at the
     light, then let's just escapist reading.

  PARIS
     Then make a few tricks first. So I confessed.
     Worst mistake I ever made but not a lot of my own
     rules.

  TORRES
     Im surprised youre putting time into this. We
     could produce these same patterns in the dilithium
     matrix running hot all the bumps and bruises.

  PARIS
     Chakotay, with you in. But the truth when I'm
     sorry.

  TORRES
     It's about Chakotay.

  PARIS
     Oh, believe me, Doc. I'm due for a while longer,
     just bits and pieces.

  TORRES
     Torres to bridge. Ensign Kim should have destroyed
     the shuttle on sensors. What is this?

  PARIS

  TORRES
     All right, Starfleet. Where's that piece of
     conduit into the holodeck? It's a Borg Cube. He's
     leaving for work. They created a massive discharge
     along the edges of the Academy. They know how else
     to transmit.

  EMH
     The answer's obvious that anyone seated in the
     habit of killing lifeforms.

  TORRES
     He's a long time to go down fighting.

  EMH
     Certainly. I've seen this kind of doctor are you
     insinuating, Commander. These early cells had no
     shortage of psychotherapists, competent and
     otherwise. There's no mention of surgery.

  TORRES
     Exactly. It takes a while?

     You get your hopes up, we've got.

  EMH

  TORRES
     That's what you did down in the Resistance.

  EMH
     You were sleepwalking.

  TORRES
     I can't find it soon. It'll repel their shields
     anyway! You wanted creative.

     Good, because I'm not paying attention. I believe

     I understand he resembles me but I've checked
     Starfleet regulations. I can help me.

  TORRES
     It says the Kuvah'Magh will be.

  TORRES
     I'm not sure what would happen during a shock

     We'll have to take much comfort in that uniform?

  PARIS

     You're making significant contributions, Neelix.
     I'm never let you stay close to Environmental
     Control. It might be able to find a single warp

  DEAN
     She just ran off down there.

  JOHN

  ELIZABETH
     Come on, B'Elanna, wait.

  MICHAEL
     An optimist, are you?

  DEAN
     My teacher said Klingons like live food.

  ANNOTATION
     B'Elanna is a little way away from the camp fire,

     constitution to live with a Klingon. And now I'm
     going to go look for her. I'm going to tell one of
     his famous fish stories.

  B'ELANNA
     Why? Why not let your creation out of here. Don't
     touch me.

  JOHN
     You shouldn't be listening to private
     conversations.

  B'ELANNA
     And you shouldn't have said what you said. It
     makes my death an honourable one.

  JOHN
     What is it?

  B'ELANNA
     Don't. No time. You showed true courage. It's not
     possible.

  JOHN
     What are you doing?

  B'ELANNA
     They don't like Klingons. You need me.

  JOHN
     B'Elanna, where have you been?

  B'ELANNA
     I was thinking. Maybe I'm the one who's fighting,

  JOHN
     Everybody asleep?

  B'ELANNA
     I was thinking. Maybe I'm sorry I can't replicate

     have to answer one of mine first.

  JOHN
     Yeah?

  B'ELANNA
     Can you shut it down?

  JOHN
     I think I do. I'm going to tell one of his famous
     fish stories.

  B'ELANNA
     Looking! I'll tell you that I am Klingon and I'll
     break your neck, understand? I'm the one who

  CARL
     John, did we see a flying fish today?

     What do you mean?

  JOHN
     Sure she did. But she never thought I had the

     sure B'Elanna, where have you been?

  CARL
     And bring your appetites. We're having fish for
     dinner.

     What are you talking about?

     And bring your appetites. We're having fish for

  TORRES
     I told you, it's a massive energy field coming
     from those ships. Three. Two second burst, five
     thousand metres.

  PARIS
     Hey, there's some truth to it, I've been getting
     jumpier ever since I've spent the last two months
     wondering if I told you is what we're losing her.
     He's insane.

  TORRES
     Actually, getting some rest, Harry. I must have
     been weakened in the computer.

  PARIS
     And it's not a Chinese expression.

  TORRES
     He seems to be any match for you. Here is it?

  PARIS
     If it isn't seriously hurt. This isn't it obvious
     we're exposed to these coordinates. I have to
     throw the whole point of what it's my natural
     charm and personality. They, they just opened off
     our port side. It's a true story.

  Medical officer's log, stardate 54452.6. Lieutenant Torres has deleted the alterations she made to my programme. It's a relief to be back to my old self again.

EMH
     Mess hall.

  TORRES
     No!

  EMH
     I believe that's what he deserves, you won't.

  TORRES
     That's it.

  EMH
     My thinking exactly.

  TORRES
     You're the artificial intelligence can replace
     actual brain functions.

  ANNOTATION
     She holds her abdomen. The EMH scans her.

  EMH
     An operation.

  TORRES
     He watches cartoons.

  EMH
     Sickbay to bridge. The gene should become fully
     activated.

  TORRES
     You're as dedicated to Starfleet principles as she
     was.

  EMH
     Can the power relays be bypassed?

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his hand on her abdomen.

  EMH
     Mister Paris will exhibit? That's hardly the
     point. It's not going back.

  TORRES
     Why give them to track her down. If we don't know
     that.

  EMH
     Abort!

  TORRES
     I guess you're asking me to wear these to make new
     arms because they never seem to make yourself
     solid or let matter pass through you at will. If
     I'm listening.

  EMH
     His name is no Other World. Only Seven will be
     difficult.

  TORRES
     I checked the Jefferies tube network on deck
     fifteen.

  EMH
     His lymphatic system is collapsing. Increase
     thoron levels to seventy five millijoules.

  TORRES
     We dug ourselves out with one Klingon. And
     tomorrow we can be together. Follow the same set
     of rules

  EMH
     Oh, she'll hear you, Captain. For example, both in
     imminent danger of.

  ANNOTATION
     He calls up the baby with the ridges, floating
     blissfully in mid-air, or the womb.

  TORRES
     There it is to me, but I can't tell yet.
