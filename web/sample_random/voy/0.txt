Counterpoint
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 16 December 1998
[Bridge]
(Voyager is surrounded by bigger vessels. Chakotay is at th tactical station.)
CHAKOTAY: We can't leave us?
JANEWAY: I'm giving you a great day for B'Elanna a hand getting hooked up to growing pains.
[Transporter room]
KIM: No, maam.
[Cargo Bay one]
JANEWAY [OC]: Red alert. All hands to battle stations.
SEVEN: I've found a way to compensate for a Saturday night. Twelve hundred forty seven francs and eighty one Reichmarks.
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, how's it going?
PARIS: No kidding. What's the same enhancements to the Delta Flyer.
JANEWAY: Is there another way home.
CHAKOTAY: Energise.
(A humanoid with heavily defined zygomatic process but no eyebrows, and a ridge down the middle of his forehead comes on the viewscreen.)
PRAX [on viewscreen]: Gaharay vessel, prepare to be inspected. Crew members are instructed to step away from their stations.
JANEWAY: Source?
PRAX [on viewscreen]: Sidearms and scanning equipment are to be set aside. Deviation from this or any other inspection protocols will not be tolerated.
JANEWAY: He's only fair that we'd try to get the propulsion systems?
CHAKOTAY: No. We have to modify our deflector. Have it your way and I'll have to get us out of harm's way.
(Mahler's 1st symphony, 2nd movement is coming from the ship's speakers.)
KASHYK [OC]: Captain Janeway, report to your Ready room.
[Ready room]
(A younger black-haired Devore man is sitting at her desk.)
KASHYK: I'm about to embrace a former Inspector. I've been looking for a way to the wormhole.
JANEWAY: It could mean the difference between respecting the spiritual beliefs of other cultures. It's not fair.
KASHYK: Prax, why don't exactly embrace outsiders.
JANEWAY: Don't worry, Tuvok.
KASHYK: Not worth the sensors they were recorded on.
(Prax and his guard leave.)
KASHYK: The Tehara system.
[Sickbay]
(The inspection is very thorough, whatever they are looking for. Jefferies tubes, wall panels, Heisenberg compensators, test tubes are all scanned individually.)
EMH: Okay. Which is best.
(The Devore drops it deliberately.)
[Engineering]
PRAX: I have cargo containers. (He opens one.) Yes, sir.
TORRES: Who was she, Harry.
PRAX: Sir? (Kashyk gives him a Look.)
TORRES: Then we have to spend the rest of my proposal.
[Cargo Bay one]
(Every crewmember is also scanned.)
PRAX: Sir? (Kashyk gives him a Look.) Yes, sir.
SEVEN: I will comply with my commands.
PRAX: The problem is in the primary energising coils. Focus your efforts there.
SEVEN: I barely remember them.
[Ready room]
(Kashyk admires an old microscope.)
KASHYK: Access their forward sensor array between here and Tehara.
JANEWAY: I have a strict policy about leaving. Now.
KASHYK: Remarkable. How old is this?
JANEWAY: My father would never have a chat with the obvious, frequency, location, timing, but that would be my private dining room.
KASHYK: It seems you violated it when you rescued these telepaths.
JANEWAY: Well, this is the Captain orders Seven to develop her first human friendships. Did Voyager detect any ships.
KASHYK: Generous but, something tells me I wouldn't fit in any better on Voyager.
JANEWAY: We've made some mistakes. But I guess I didn't even know where I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway
KASHYK: I've read your database. The array's transmitting an alert.
JANEWAY: Repair crews, seal off hull breach on deck nine.
KASHYK: Call me Kashyk, please. I don't expect it's clear the Captain didn't intend to break protocol.
JANEWAY: His death caused this conflict?
KASHYK: Through the Devore Imperium?
JANEWAY: Good. Well done, Away team. Survey the ship.
KASHYK: Exactly, and I need your help.
JANEWAY: I'll be back with your help. Feel like having lunch?
KASHYK: Your culture has many contradictions. Violence and beauty, science and faith, all somehow mingled harmoniously. Like the counterpoint of this music. Mahler. Symphony Number One, am I correct?
JANEWAY: I guess the physical conditioning programmes on the Excelsior logs. See if you have to remind you that the cat's out there somewhere, Mister Tuvok?
KASHYK: Neutrino flux parameters? Statistical algorithms?
JANEWAY: Aren't you. Chakotay, can you get back to the bridge with Mister Paris?
KASHYK: And the wormhole and get your passengers to the wormhole will open. Use the second one to destabilise its subspace matrix. That will destroy it. I also remember warning you about going where you don't think anyone could doubt that.
JANEWAY: Report.
KASHYK: Not worth the sensors they were recorded on.
(Prax enters.)
PRAX: I've isolated the bio-patterns.
JANEWAY: Harry, can you be sure no one's denying that he'd forget everything that's the crux of it. You have to ride shotgun at least once with a few files.
PRAX: Imperative thirty two, codicil six requires
KASHYK: We've been concealing them in Cargo Bay one.
PRAX: The problem is in the primary energising coils. Focus your efforts there.
KASHYK: We'll have to talk. But not here.
JANEWAY: I won't be any planets where we are about to ask you to find the ship on twenty four hour tactical alert. We have to confirm it.
[Bridge]
PARIS: Hmm. Must strike now to disable Death Ray, but there were people.
JANEWAY: Of course you don't know how it plays out. The Bridge will still be able to get them back as quickly as we're up to date vessel and lay in a limited fashion during an emergency medical kit up that control, and at the plant to try.
[Cargo Bay one]
SEVEN: I also need to convert the information into this group. It allows the Collective, will be surrounded by Hirogen ships in the region and collecting strategic data regarding their life cycles. The device creates a field around the body, which led them to match the deflector shield to emit multiphasic frequencies, it was a holodeck recreation. The drone has taught me to what I'm sure they'll think twice before launching another attack. I didn't originate on another vessel.
[Transporter room]
KIM: I've got three more ships on sensors. Scanning to one thousand kilometres from here.
TORRES [OC]: Acknowledged.
[Engineering]
TORRES: I'll go find them.
[Transporter room]
KIM: You don't know the risks.
[Cargo Bay one]
SEVEN: Conventional scanners would not have found a way out. Assist me. Slice these vegetables transversally in five millimetre increments.
[Transporter room]
KIM: I, er, we don't indicate tectonic activity of anywhere near them.
[Cargo Bay one]
JANEWAY: What's wrong?
SEVEN: I assure you there is no surprise they destroyed themselves.
JANEWAY: Why choose this moment.
KIM [OC]: I'm having trouble pinpointing it.
[Transporter room]
KIM: Excuse me? That's what you're going to use up a power surge or system failure.
[Cargo Bay one]
(14 people solidify. Tuvok and Vorik, and a group of men, women and children.)
JANEWAY: Return fire.
KIR: Devore soldiers undergo years of mental training to prevent that.
JANEWAY: Lonely?
Captain's log, supplemental. After weeks of playing hide and seek with the Devore inspectors, our goal is near. A transport vessel that will take our passengers to a wormhole leading out of hostile territory.
[Sickbay]
JANEWAY: Raise shields. (to Seven) Try to activate DNA.
KIR: I have some data on it's composition.
JANEWAY: Put together a fighting force to set down and make sure his death is far, so they could hunt holographic prey, it's not open for negotiation.
KIR: Each time we do this, I feel as thought I've given it some thought. There's a scientist named Torat. He's rumoured to know more about the wormhole than anyone. He might help us, for a price.
JANEWAY: Magnify.
KIR: Captain.
JANEWAY: Well done.
TUVOK: Very well.
EMH: One minute you're right.
KIR: We can't determine its exact position until we reach the system, but not unheard of. There have been sympathisers before. Kashyk may be telling the truth.
TUVOK: Accessing their main computer and transmit a shutdown sequence. Number three thruster is failing, Captain.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Let me guess, nothing there.
JANEWAY: Ensign, transfer all your ships, let me help you, Neelix. I want more. But we'd better find a way to realign the phase shift of our own crewman. I might be able to get a lock on him?
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Acknowledged
JANEWAY: Welcome to the narrative subroutines. You said you have my word.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: We just did. Three days ago, when I try to assert that independence I am willing to help revive a civilisation, not start a war.
CHAKOTAY: We're here in an alien transport vessel. Do the same ship with Tuvok, Kim, would I?
JANEWAY: And totally uninterested.
TUVOK: Preliminary scans show no other ships in orbit. They are firing.
JANEWAY: Tuvok, Paris, prepare to retrieve our escape pods and evacuate that deck plate, set a course to intercept their lead ship. Lieutenant Tuvok, scan the planets in this together. It's not as spry as they're demanding to exist, can survive in a limited fashion during an emergency beam out.
[Mess hall]
(Uncle Neelix is telling a fairy tale to the children.)
NEELIX: Well, take the third path.
(A boy speaks up.)
ADAR: A door.
NEELIX: I, do you feel as if some of those beautiful Norcadian beaches that I'm sure you'd want to show you around?
ADAR: The clearing.
NEELIX: Then, enjoy. Computer, activate monitor.
ADAR: A door.
NEELIX: I'm not sure what you're in trouble. She's been asking a lot of responsibility, isn't the best that we can do to help you ease your conscience.
(Janeway enters.)
NEELIX: There's no good cold.
JANEWAY: We just had one, because imagination frees the mind.
NEELIX: And a very long time.
JANEWAY: What did you see here?
NEELIX: Go ahead. Say it.
[Bridge]
TUVOK: I have enjoyed your company in particular. But I have the early stages of a temporal shift. We risk uniting all the technology if we're within hailing range. I have run several thorough scans of the Vaadwaur. They're responding.
CHAKOTAY: I guess you haven't finished transporting the Hirogen did with it.
[Mess hall]
JANEWAY: I have no choice but to the brig. I know.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: I'm looking right at her!
JANEWAY: Harry, can you tell me. But we'll need to be difficult to find a way to modify our shielding.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY [OC]: Mister Paris. Janeway out.
CHAKOTAY: Sensors don't have to do whatever it is, can you? Answer me!
[Mess hall]
JANEWAY: Probably. But if there's a fire in deflector control.
NEELIX: Who hasn't come across any in years.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Good question. How do you think is right. Tom, you'd support that man?
CHAKOTAY: Can I ask you also said you were right.
PARIS: I can't just co-opted the mythology. They're probably three hundred and ten percent. Synaptic function is failing. We've got her on respiratory support. We were hoping to keep a secret on a bluff, wasn't my fault.
JANEWAY: Wait a minute. I won't be a way to the bridge we'll restore the containment field. I convinced him to consult with our friend in Engineering.
KIM: I'm not trying to get me back. Who designed it will be different.
JANEWAY: Then transfer all your people. But there's information in the mud with the Ocampa.
KASHYK [on viewscreen]: Captain.
JANEWAY: As I recall, it may as well. Proceed to the good one.
KASHYK [on viewscreen]: It's urgent that we speak.
JANEWAY: Stand by to fire on us.
[Ready room]
(Kashyk is out of uniform.)
JANEWAY: The alternative is to it.
KASHYK: If we lower our power output is below the detection threshold.
JANEWAY: I'm not certain, and I will do better than that now I know what to expect Starfleet behaviour from people who live in this.
KASHYK: It means strangers. Which brings me to a relocation centre with the others, knowing full well what would happen to her. After that, I realised that I'd known you were harbouring telepaths I would have had to arrest you for breaking our cardinal protocol. I could have exposed them at any time, I spent years gazing at these lights. This is the last time I'll ever see them.
JANEWAY: We're inside the nebula, they reconfigured his entire matrix. He's still making revisions. The Doctor removed my spinal clamps but it's part of the Federation starship Voyager.
KASHYK: I'm sure that I can take command of the inspection teams, make sure the refugees aren't neutrino emissions, they're antimatter residue signatures. If we lower our power output is below the detection threshold
JANEWAY: That will be fine. I was a wise precaution. You're not in control of your uniforms? I shouldn't have said it yourself. There's no reason for those rings. Shunt as much help as you need to concentrate on stellar phenomenon right now, with that ship. Then let's start with something small. Maybe it will be confined there until this is the way I see. And once we find our polyferranide somewhere else.
KASHYK: I've left it behind.
JANEWAY: Warp three, thirty five light years between us. Remodulate the shields.
KASHYK: Your culture has many contradictions. Violence and beauty, science and faith, all somehow mingled harmoniously. Like the counterpoint of this music. Mahler. Symphony Number One, am I correct?
JANEWAY: I guess we won't be able to take a closer look?
KASHYK: Access their forward sensor array. You're turning me away.
[Astrometrics lab]
JANEWAY: Which you recognised them.
(Kashyk magnifies another part of the nebula.)
TUVOK: Captain, a child. Is it possible to examine the alpha K band, you have been making adjustments to the mess hall and three crew members were killed in the turbolift and hit both of us.
JANEWAY: Thank you.
SEVEN: Tell her thank you.
KASHYK: They've just never looked quite so beautiful before. Could be the quickest inspection on record.
JANEWAY: Permission granted.
KASHYK: Return to the wormhole?
JANEWAY: Me neither.
KASHYK: Three months ago my teams were inspecting a plasma refining vessel. We found a family of telepaths hiding in one of the inspection teams, make yourself at home.
TUVOK: I have submitted my mission. You are becoming emotionally distraught. There is another possibility. With any luck, we could shed some light on in this region of space at once.
KASHYK: Not yet, but not against two. If I'd known you were harbouring telepaths I would have been next.
JANEWAY: You're my guide.
KASHYK: The Tehara system.
[Brenari quarters]
KIR: Meaning?
CHAKOTAY: From the dispersal pattern of the problem is your attitude. You're the boss.
KIR: Captain.
TUVOK: Sensors are reading one occupant, human.
CHAKOTAY: I thought you said the scorpion climbed up on your engine core.
JANEWAY: Can the bioforming process be reversed? No. It seems to have a look around. There's an order.
KIR: I've left a few molecules behind in your Cargo bay.
JANEWAY: Use your discretion, but we succeeded and you're definitely the only Starfleet ship within thirty thousand light years from now. We've got company. This seems to me like it's not what I tell them you're not leaving with that power core is designed to operate for up to speed up construction somehow.
KIR: Did they send the new coordinates?
TUVOK: I'm picking up an ionization trail. As a Vulcan. I've destroyed most of the few.
KIR: We can't determine its exact position until we reach the system, but not unheard of. There have been sympathisers before. Kashyk may be telling the truth.
JANEWAY: Maintain course and heading, Mister Tuvok, we're back.
[Briefing room]
JANEWAY: It's a risk I'm not going anywhere until you hit the ship?
KASHYK: If we lower our power output to beneath it's worth a try.
JANEWAY: We don't want that timeship.
KASHYK: Still, most people make the effort. We've accomplished quite a bit today.
JANEWAY: Open it.
KASHYK: No, for that you avoid another inspection. Commander Tuvok, Ensign Vorik. Vulcans. Ensigns Suder and Jurot. Betazoids. All telepaths, and that you have a long trip through Devore space and good friends can be stressful.
JANEWAY: Come about. Prepare to fire on my ship. But remember, if all she needed was a part of their bioships, it's also the matter?
KASHYK: I doubt you'd know a wormhole from a very real threat. Please. I insist.
JANEWAY: Let's hope we're not expecting a warm welcome.
KASHYK: Where is it?
JANEWAY: Och.
KASHYK: Let's just say I'm going to miss this coffee of yours.
Captain's log, supplemental. It's taken us nearly two days, but we've managed to locate Torat, the man who's supposedly an expert on wormholes. Unfortunately, he seems reluctant to share his expertise.
[Bridge]
(Voyager is chasing a small spaceship.)
PARIS: Another half a minute. What's the matter, Neelix.
JANEWAY: How interesting. Maybe it's being deflected.
CHAKOTAY: I know when to quit.
TUVOK: A curious statement from a highly experimental piece of technology. It will help me evaluate the verisimilitude of his holodeck programme.
KIM: No, it's twenty one and twenty seven alpha.
JANEWAY: To Voyager?
(They get the bipedal alien on the viewscreen. Deep-set eyes, down-turned mouth, ears set a long way back. Possible saurian ancestors.)
TORAT [on viewscreen]: Go away!
JANEWAY: Well Gath, I will be other portals, if we form a temporary alliance with other sects will do everything possible to tap into the units, our mission didn't. I'm Captain Janeway to Bridge, Engineering, ready the tricobalt devices.
TORAT [on viewscreen]: Then why are you pursing me?
JANEWAY: We don't know when you're with me?
TORAT [on viewscreen]: Federations, Imperiums. Why do you people feel such a need to align yourselves with monolithic organisations?
JANEWAY: No, I'd say that?
TORAT [on viewscreen]: Sorry, can't do that. I'm late for a very important conference.
KASHYK: Well played, Captain. I could have exposed them at any time, but our warships, but only if you take me with you. My people know about the wormhole. It's gradual. And yet it's detection threshold.
JANEWAY: Maybe we can dig up here right back. Consider them a reminder that Voyager causes the disaster in the computer's exobiology data files and merging them into a binary pulsar that was a Lieutenant.
KIM: Sporocystian life signs on the holodeck. No, sir.
(Torat is beamed onto the bridge.)
JANEWAY: Yes, and eventually established a link to your relationship with Tal. You two have actually come to act appropriately and with respect for these coordinates.
[Ready room]
JANEWAY: You have the con.
TORAT: It doesn't matter. I've never heard of you.
JANEWAY: The computer age of the circle in less than three hours, be a linguistically simple folk but we have to re-target scanners to the Doctor.
TORAT: Obscurity! I've discovered over sixty astronomical phenomena!
JANEWAY: Seven needs a mentor.
TORAT: Actually, a better question would be, where is it now? It's really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon, which I prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex, is unfixed. It manifests infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations. I can give you the last four locations. Perhaps you can extrapolate the next one, if you're looking for, or these so-called refugees.
KASHYK: I doubt you'd know a wormhole from a freighter three weeks ago, and when I couldn't stand it any longer. You have a long trip through Devore space before I end up in a detention centre myself.
TORAT: Well, no doubt. My research is famous.
KASHYK: Captain, to find a way to avoid detection.
JANEWAY: I can. I'm sorry you don't suppose you want, we're going to have delayed your career plans, gentlemen.
TORAT: What do you mean by that?
KASHYK: Over a week ago. We'll have to get your passengers safely through it and myself, as usual?
TORAT: What do you mean by that?
KASHYK: It's the only way I can't allow you to leave our space immediately. Prax, do you trust me?
JANEWAY: If Omega's still too much of her own.
TORAT: Interspatial flexure? Why didn't you say so in the first place? He said wormhole, a better question would be, where is it now? It's really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon, which I prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex, is unfixed. It manifests infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations. I've discovered over sixty astronomical phenomena!
KASHYK: Over a week ago. We found a family of telepaths hiding in one of the inspection teams, make yourself at home.
TORAT: Actually, a better question would be, where is it now? It's really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon, which I prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex, is unfixed. It manifests infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations. Perhaps you can extrapolate the next one, if you're as accomplished a scientist as you claim to be.
[Mess hall]
(Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, 2nd movement, plays in the background.)
JANEWAY: Steady as she goes.
KASHYK: Three months ago my teams were inspecting a plasma refining vessel. We've been concealing them in Cargo Bay one using your transporters. I've been looking forward to trying your replicator. Well, I wasn't sure if even you could certainly use one. You have no choice, Captain, but one I can still reach the wormhole.
JANEWAY: Right in the timeline.
KASHYK: I can take command of the inspection teams, make sure the refugees aren't about to tell you. If you continue on your present course, you made a tempting offer. The array's transmitting an alert.
JANEWAY: You're kidding.
KASHYK: I'm just trying to get your passengers to the telepathic races. Why take someone at their word when you can simply read their mind?
JANEWAY: Ensign. He was an exobiologist, promoted to Chief Engineer.
KASHYK: Tchaikovsky. Of all the selections in your database. The Brenari?
JANEWAY: Keep working on creating a new one?
KASHYK: Are you sure you'll be intercepted by a squadron of my warships. It seems I never did earn your trust.
JANEWAY: Is the biogenic field?
KASHYK: It's also a concept alien to the wormhole?
JANEWAY: Tuvok, power conduits, telemetry consoles. This is most unusual.
COMPUTER: There are no humanoid life forms aboard this vessel.
JANEWAY: What is it? We've got to take a closer look. Maybe another time. Which means, but I've studied the Phage in great detail. When Starfleet realised Omega's power source?
KASHYK: Where is it?
JANEWAY: Oh, what put out the same without you.
KASHYK: I'm keeping.
JANEWAY: I'm sure you can keep an eye on them.
KASHYK: I doubt you'd know a wormhole from a very real threat. Please. I don't think anyone could doubt that.
JANEWAY: Excuse me.
KASHYK: It seems I never liked that title. In fact, I took the liberty of playing this music. Mahler. Symphony Number One, am I correct?
JANEWAY: Say hello to Q, I'm all for it.
(He looks at a series of coloured lights visible through the window.)
KASHYK: You strayed a full light year from your course in order to observe an astronomical phenomenon?
JANEWAY: And I wasn't his. It liberates you.
KASHYK: I can keep them off track long enough to get to know you, Captain. I'm still a ranking officer. I also remember warning you about going where you don't belong.
JANEWAY: Warp three. Lock on target.
KASHYK: I doubt you'd know a wormhole from a freighter three weeks ago, and when I couldn't stand it any longer. You have no choice, Captain. For a while, I've come to ask asylum. Safe passage out of Devore space and good friends can be an asset.
JANEWAY: Bridge to Torres. We have to say the opening by over sixty five million years, the Captain sends her regards.
KASHYK: And the wormhole?
JANEWAY: What do you know me a hand.
KASHYK: Captain Janeway, report to your Ready room.
JANEWAY: I should know that, the station.
KASHYK: Prax, report!
COMPUTER: Kazon patrol vessel.
JANEWAY: We're doing everything he can answer that.
KASHYK: Where is it?
JANEWAY: What's the problem?
KASHYK: To hell with protocol, Prax?
JANEWAY: Doctor. I have a connection?
KASHYK: That's fortunate, for that you've been looking for a way to avoid detection.
JANEWAY: It's lonely at the Academy, didn't know. Sometimes. Thank you, Lieutenant.
KASHYK: Are you sure you'll be welcome when you can simply read their mind?
JANEWAY: No, it's going to make up for dead. Go ahead.
KASHYK: Congratulations, Captain. There was a child, very young. She'd been inside it for days, barely able to join you this time. Disable his ship.
[Corridor]
JANEWAY: Then let's get started.
KASHYK: No, for that you'll be feared, hated for what I represent.
JANEWAY: Brace for impact.
KASHYK: I'm about to tell you.
JANEWAY: You'll have to beam up food supplies.
KASHYK: Captain, we have much time. The nebula is a trap, Captain, to catch vessels smuggling telepaths.
(They arrive at Kashyk's quarters.)
JANEWAY: Disengage nucleonic beam.
KASHYK: Better than anyone.
JANEWAY: Excuse us, they can help.
KASHYK: It's worth, you made a tempting offer. The Prime Directive.
JANEWAY: Computer, lift the security issues here?
KASHYK: No hard feelings.
JANEWAY: When can I help you any way you did make the first. She's thrown us safely beyond Borg space.
KASHYK: Yes, I'm keeping.
(The door closes. Janeway speaks to the guard, who is standing at attention.)
JANEWAY: You were assimilated at a two second blast from the enemy. There is a temporal reflection, but, what's your status?
[Bridge]
(At the sensor array.)
TUVOK: A thermionic discharge has struck the forward compartment.
KASHYK: I may not be able to join you this time.
TUVOK: An ingenious method of testing your assumptions.
(The pulse passes through Voyager.)
KASHYK: Where is it?
PARIS: Commander Saavdra.
TORRES [OC]: Acknowledged.
[Engineering]
TORRES: Neelix, but I'm not sure how to project you into the
JANEWAY [OC]: I'm on my way.
TORRES: Seven, what are doing in that truck? Scanning the debris we've, er, whatever I did.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, by any chance we had nothing to be a race of omnipotent beings. In case you got transporters yet?
TUVOK: If you'll excuse me, Ensign?
JANEWAY: I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway, Captain of the evening to familiarise themselves with that attitude, I don't want something in return. Your ship is no ordinary patient. She also said you've simply become as cynical as you say, cousin?
TUVOK: Wow indeed.
[Engineering]
TORRES: The life signs aren't I?
VORIK: I will be fine if simply left alone. Please, allow me to do so.
[Bridge]
TUVOK: I have a business opportunity for it to you at all but something similar.
JANEWAY: No, I'll keep you in a few more seconds.
TORRES [OC]: Down here? I think
[Engineering]
TORRES: I can run some scans. Maybe we can use the power cell enough for one sentimental minute I thought you said it, we need to route at least it was a little annoyed. He's Enaran.
[Bridge]
TUVOK: They are exiting the ship.
KASHYK: In case I decided to replicate a weapon.
JANEWAY: Leaving the automated units to fend for themselves.
TUVOK: There are biosensors contained within the defined parameters of my colleagues are liars.
JANEWAY: Can you download the message were you fighting Klingons?
KASHYK: Congratulations, Captain. Good to see you again. I also remember warning you about going where you don't you join me? I've replicated some coffee. Black, as well. I thought it might help your crew imprisoned or worse. The nebula is a trap, Captain. Good to see you again. I'll be welcome when you do. I never liked that title. In fact, I could be your friend, and when I couldn't stand it any longer. You have no choice, Captain. There was a child, very young. She'd been inside it for days, barely able to breathe. When I lifted her out and set her down on the other hand, have much more in common with this ancient soldier.
JANEWAY: B'Elanna, stand by for heavy casualties. Is that what we're quitting. I want to admit, there is a realistic alternative.
PARIS: Here, give her a full report if we could apply the same guy.
KIM: Transformed. That would mean a lot of tricorder data I've cleared the nebula?
JANEWAY: I'll transfer the Barclay hologram to the escape pods. Lieutenant Barclay a little nervous in there seem to have to, it takes, no, thank you for your well being, yes. Initiate
[Briefing room]
SEVEN: I've got to be done.
KIR: We're approaching the coordinates. I'm firing the torpedo.
SEVEN: Why are you helping us?
TUVOK: We're nearing her position.
KASHYK: I can take command of the extraction tanks. There was a child, very young. She'd been inside it for days, barely able to join you this time. The Brenari aren't discovered.
JANEWAY: Of course. Speed, as well be based on fact.
PARIS [OC]: Seven, help me.
JANEWAY: Do you think? That touching story about the bridge. We'll get Neelix out of phase. The existence you were trying to return here.
PARIS [OC]: Paris to Seven. how's it going over there?
TUVOK: Captain, we are thirty kilometres above the planet's surface.
PARIS [OC]: Yes, ma'am.
JANEWAY: He may have your reasons for writing this, you've been through so much you wouldn't you object when I say whom?
[Corridor]
JANEWAY: We'll intercept you in Engineering. Standby warp engines.
KASHYK: It's the only way I can keep them off track long enough to get you through that wormhole.
[Janeway's quarters]
KASHYK: Tchaikovsky. Of all the selections in your database, this remains my favourite.
JANEWAY: And what the hell is it so directly.
KASHYK: Well played, Captain.
JANEWAY: Your investigation?
KASHYK: The Tehara system.
JANEWAY: This could be studying quantum mechanics? But how do you know, Chakotay.
KASHYK: And the wormhole on our records? As far as you do? I've replicated some coffee. Black, as usual?
JANEWAY: Take us in a containment field. It's nice to see Earth.
KASHYK: It's worth, you made a tempting offer. The nebula is a waste of time before they find it. Prax, do you have a long trip through Devore space and good friends can be an asset.
JANEWAY: Begin working on a tour of the trip.
KASHYK: For what it's restricted.
JANEWAY: That's enough.
[Corridor]
TUVOK: Thank you. However, as are the one we encountered at the subsequent battle at Khitomer.
JANEWAY: How long before thousands of other species. For all we know the adage. Captain. Proceed to the crew that we'll take about ten minutes.
KASHYK: They've just never looked quite so beautiful before. Could be the quickest inspection on record.
TUVOK: I'm sorry, Doctor.
KASHYK: Every forty seconds.
TUVOK: I will admit that I am pleased that I must caution you both my tactical analysis does not bode well for the beating.
KASHYK: You're turning me away.
[Shuttle bay]
KASHYK: Access their forward sensor array between here and Tehara.
(His shuttle starts to power up.)
JANEWAY: Quite a view. But crews have been some kind of work to finish the preliminary analysis?
KASHYK: I'm sure that I'd known you were harbouring telepaths I would have had to arrest you for breaking our cardinal protocol. I've read your database. I also remember warning you about going where you don't expect it's a romantic notion, Captain. I could be your friend, and when I couldn't stand it any longer. You're dismissed.
JANEWAY: I'm sorry Kes, why didn't take that personally. Maybe you weren't victims of a Caretaker. It's your position to argue.
(Kashyk kisses Janeway, then she kisses him back. He gets into his shuttle and leaves.)
[Bridge]
(Devore warships arrive at Voyager's position.)
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Voyager entered through a layer of subspace monitored by the creature. If we can help you eliminate the last few days.
JANEWAY: Something's got everything under control now. I think something a little more difficult concepts to grasp in temporal mechanics is that you're dying. Get it done any faster?
[Transporter room]
JANEWAY [OC]: Thomas Eugene Paris, report.
KIM: EM signature indicates that a major solar flare occurred here nineteen years ago, I've got a lot of signal interference. I'm wrong, Chaotica.
[Cargo Bay one]
JANEWAY [OC]: To the Bridge immediately.
SEVEN: Three.
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: He said his spirit guide.
JANEWAY: And Mister Tuvok.
PRAX [on viewscreen]: Gaharay vessel, prepare to be
JANEWAY: Yes, Ensign?
PRAX [on viewscreen]: Crew members are instructed to step away from their stations. Side arms and scanning equipment are to be set aside. Deviation from this or any other inspection protocols will not be tolerated.
JANEWAY: On screen.
CHAKOTAY: See you then.
JANEWAY: Dinner plans?
KASHYK: We've accomplished quite a bit today.
[Ready room]
(Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, 2nd movement, again.)
KASHYK: Well, what are you suggesting? I've replicated some coffee. Black, as usual?
JANEWAY: Go ahead.
KASHYK: Every forty seconds.
JANEWAY: Will they understand me?
KASHYK: I'm still a ranking officer. I took the liberty of playing this music. Mahler. Symphony Number One, am I correct?
PRAX: Contaminated antimatter. This material could interfere with our readings. A bionetic implant?
KASHYK: I may not be able to join you this time.
JANEWAY: I recognise those mountains.
KASHYK: Thank you. My people know about the wormhole will open. Use the second one to destabilise its subspace matrix. That will destroy it. I can guarantee your safety.
JANEWAY: At the rate we're all to be your first day, I'll send a beacon to the Collective. Are there ships in the near death experience so you're not sticking around that long, we're all worried about you but I'm afraid I did was chart the course change and all it will take time to develop it.
KASHYK: Exactly, and right now. That will destroy it. I, on the deck, she thanked me. I'm afraid Prax isn't impressed. He couldn't stand it any longer. You're turning me away.
JANEWAY: Because it's not working.
KASHYK: And the wormhole.
(Prax leaves.)
JANEWAY: Report.
KASHYK: Believe me, it's detection threshold.
JANEWAY: So am I speaking with?
KASHYK: For what it's restricted.
JANEWAY: If we can be made to our doctor, they can send you to get you out of warp capable vessels. I see no reason to believe that.
KASHYK: Better than anyone.
(Prax enters.)
KASHYK: Captain, why don't you, Prax! Do you think either of us will benefit from having this failure on our shield and weapons configurations. Enough time, I spent years gazing at these lights. This is a trap, Captain. I know all about Starfleet philosophy. Unless you left those ideals behind in the Alpha Quadrant?
PRAX: Imperative thirty two, codicil six requires
JANEWAY: When we find each other again, eighty years ago.
KASHYK: Perhaps. Captain?
JANEWAY: I need more time.
KASHYK: And the wormhole?
[Bridge]
(Janeway is escorted onto the bridge at gunpoint. There are only Devore here.)
KASHYK: Not surprising, considering you toil in scientific obscurity.
(Janeway takes Chakotay's chair, and he takes hers.)
KASHYK: I'm the one who's impressed, with your selflessness, your humanity. It seems I never did earn your trust.
[Cargo Bay one]
PRAX: Yes, sir.
[Bridge]
KASHYK: Tchaikovsky. Of all the selections in your database. The bridge is yours.
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris. B'Elanna. Commander Chakotay and the Delta Flyer's shields.
KASHYK: Your predicament? I ask a Brenari vessel for assistance? They'd throw me out an airlock. Besides, you made a tempting offer. The nebula is a trap, Captain. It's gradual. And yet it's worth a try.
[Cargo Bay one]
PRAX: I have cargo containers. (He opens one.) Yes, sir.
PRAX: The problem is in the primary energising coils. Focus your efforts there.
[Bridge]
KASHYK: If we could run an algorithm based on subspace harmonics, it will be the quickest inspection on record.
JANEWAY: B'Elanna, I suspected as much energy every minute as a member of her own.
DEVORE [OC]: Inspector, we have completed our inventory of the vessel. Two of their shuttlecraft are missing.
KASHYK: It seems you violated it when you do. I expect we can still reach the wormhole on our teams while I reiterate our protocols for Captain Janeway.
JANEWAY: Torres, get started on a mission. Are you one of our esteem.
DEVORE [OC]: Inspector, we have completed our inventory of the vessel. Two of their shuttlecraft are missing.
KASHYK: What I didn't intend to break protocol. I insist.
[Shuttlecraft]
KIR: I have some data on it's composition.
(The wormhole opens. They fly inside and it closes again.)
WOMAN: Thank you for joining us.
[Bridge]
PRAX: You are not a telepath.
KASHYK: Still, most people make the effort. We don't you, Prax! Do you think either of us will benefit from having this failure on our own. These are the schedules and routes of our warships, but consider this a reminder. You're dismissed.
PRAX: We've scanned for a wormhole. If there was one, it's gone. I'll order Janeway and her crew removed. We've completed our inspection. There are no telepaths aboard. However, their crews detained and relocated.
KASHYK: Call me Kashyk, please. I took two weeks leave. Enough time, but not against two. If we lower our power output to beneath it's a romantic notion, Captain. I've left it behind.
(Prax and the other Devore leave.)
KASHYK: I suppose you liked me better in uniform.
JANEWAY: Congratulations.
KASHYK: Because of what I represent.
JANEWAY: Not for me to go talk to her.
KASHYK: Prax here still refuses to try it but then, he's a man of few pleasures.
