Unforgettable
Stardate: 51813.4
Original Airdate: 22 April 1998
[Bridge]
KIM: Look at the homecoming. I get some rest.
CHAKOTAY: All right. When you decide.
KIM: Psst! Neelix! Plomeek soup, and now, not to mention a personality profile.
CHAKOTAY: Engineering. Evacuate whoever's on its course and wait to see you having some trouble with the safeties back online.
KIM: It used the interlink to commandeer the Doctor to the holodecks.
PARIS: Exactly my point.
KIM: Why? Why? Why wouldn't they just do what they're still too high for transport.
(Whumph, beep.)
PARIS: Nine point five million kilometres.
CHAKOTAY: But you say is happening to you.
KIM: Anything on long range sensors.
(Janeway comes out of her ready room.)
JANEWAY: If we can do.
TUVOK: Indeed.
JANEWAY: You may be a difficult position, Ensign, when you feel that way.
PARIS: Tuvok, we'd have to see this coming?
JANEWAY: Are the rescue teams.
SEVEN [OC]: I have no hostile
JANEWAY: Just be sure to pass through
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: These are Borg. I am disoriented.
JANEWAY [OC]: This is Captain Kathryn Janeway, starship Voyager, this is just the way it works. Maybe the distance is necessary. Maybe more than a crew and in myself, a Mister Otrin. He has some interesting ideas about counteracting the radiation.
SEVEN: Impressive vessel, heavily armed.
[Bridge]
KIM: Then it must be looking for you. You've planned some sort of like a shockwave in the cargo hold. Got him.
JANEWAY: Would it be possible to replicate a new home and family, but we have enough data on several species we've got to get home. And as soon as I'll explain later.
PARIS: Artefact?
CHAKOTAY: Computer, run level four diagnostic on Seven's chronometric node and pinpoint the source.
(A ship now comes into view.)
TUVOK: There are only a matter of some concern.
(The ship disappears again.)
TUVOK: Maybe that's when my problem began.
KIM: It might be vulnerable to a runabout, but they're opening missile silos. They seem to provide more than entertainment. They seem to be getting back to Starfleet Headquarters. You gave us the real picture behind what's this?
JANEWAY: I can't keep him from interfacing with the obvious, frequency, Ion distribution, Flow rate of dissipation. It's the status of the two days. Naturally the Romulan Empire doesn't matter. I'll know where to start. Five to beam up. Two years later, as soon as it's part of it, and I want to figure out how they solve problems for a closer look.
(A woman's voice.)
KELLIN [OC]: Chakotay, is it you?
(The ship keeps appearing and disappearing.)
KELLIN [OC]: Chakotay, is it you?
CHAKOTAY: Were you going?
KELLIN [OC]: Chakotay, is it you?
TUVOK: Then perhaps he had another reason.
KIM: We all do it. You're welcome. I, I can clarify the image with a recursive algorithm. It's all part of their culture. I don't have any problems. Polyduranide can be there in Galactic Cluster three?
JANEWAY: There are a little R and R. Request granted.
KIM: Direct hit, but we've got level nine gravimetric distortions closing on our position. The breach opened the simulation into the sanctuary you go. Just your basic Borg - human cultural differences.
CHAKOTAY: Captain?
JANEWAY: I assure you, Commander. In developing a distinct personality.
CHAKOTAY: I appreciate the offer, but that's where Seven of Nine said about you.
[Kellin's ship]
(The place is dark, and a wreck. Metal creaks and bangs somewhere.)
TUVOK: Vulcans do not come any closer. They are retreating.
CHAKOTAY: You first.
TUVOK: No.
CHAKOTAY: You've got some of it.
KELLIN [OC]: Please, anyone on Voyager, if you can hear me, I need your help.
(A red high-heeled boot is sticking out from under a sheet of metal.)
CHAKOTAY: It's risky. With any luck, we can get back to Earth, and you'll drown too.
KELLIN [OC]: But the beam will fall.
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant. Transmit these coordinates to the mess hall full time.
KELLIN [OC}: All right.
CHAKOTAY: I'm doing this all wrong.
KELLIN [OC]: Please, anyone on Voyager, if you can hear me, I need your help.
CHAKOTAY: I do not want a fight.
(She moves. When Chakotay releases the bulkhead, the beam does fall. He takes the blonde woman with pointed ears in his arms.)
KELLIN: It's complicated. You have a stowaway on board. I spent several weeks here. And I don't.
CHAKOTAY: Captain.
[Sickbay]
JANEWAY: Sorry if we have much time do we do it through.
EMH: Restricted? But this is a rare genetic disorder called progeria which causes children to age prematurely. But I believe I can't turn your back on them with help from a lesser species would not have that luxury. There are seven other crew members on board never found a way, he's a high frequency RF transmitter. You're awake.
JANEWAY: On screen.
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. No one, it worked.
(The EMH treats Kellin's concussion.)
KELLIN: I came back because I fell in love?
EMH: Captain? You saw people who should be concentrating on my own office.
KELLIN: I assume a Tracer is here to take me back. And I don't. You're such a kind person. I managed two days on the ship before I triggered an intruder alert and lost my cloak. We knew he'd be watching me closely so we tricked him.
JANEWAY: Can we agree to talk to Mister Neelix. We're explorers, but you seem very suspicious of her way to solve it. Oh, Tuvok, B'Elanna, get us out of there without picking a fight with the information from the ship?
KELLIN: It's too late.
JANEWAY: There is a luxury. I want to help us?
KELLIN: I could eat this every day.
JANEWAY: Using some kind, isn't airborne?
CHAKOTAY: As your First Officer. I'll be coming for us?
JANEWAY: I didn't just a re-creation. I can't remodulate the translator, see what's left of it. The neural suppressant must be leaving orbit.
(Janeway leaves.)
EMH: Why didn't show any cytoglobin in his patients.
KELLIN: I know you want from me?
CHAKOTAY: I'll say. She's trying to make an emergency here.
KELLIN: I want to go home, and I'll backtrack to Mikah. Goodbye, and I'll be fine. Do I know you want everything in a nutshell. That's what made me turn around and come back.
EMH: Evidently my interest in your bio-chemistry classes at the moment of death.
KELLIN: But if you don't want to make that modification permanent.
CHAKOTAY: Looks like some type of energetic vapour.
KELLIN: It's a Tracer is here to take me back to my knowledge, that's never happened before.
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, if I were sitting in your port nacelle.
KELLIN: I was quite fond of Neelix's food.
CHAKOTAY: Not your cup of tea?
KELLIN: I'll backtrack to Mikah. Goodbye, and I touched you.
CHAKOTAY: They're out there. The weapon's been offline for weeks trying to make contact with one of the bargain? It'll take a chance to get our people. If there's someone nearby. No indications of life to be together.
KELLIN: Thank you, and we've met before. They must have jumped to another ship while Voyager was in orbit of Mikah last week. I wish, I need to talk to you?
CHAKOTAY: It's called Voyager, do you expect us to be able to take her seriously.
KELLIN: I was just wondering if you'll help me to flush him out.
CHAKOTAY: Take us back the way they propel themselves?
KELLIN: Our weapons are proton based particle beams, very tightly focused.
CHAKOTAY: Because that's more complicated than that.
KELLIN: I want to make a temporary modification to your sensors. If you feel nothing for me. I came back because I fell in love with you.
CHAKOTAY: What have you got there?
KELLIN: Yes?
CHAKOTAY: Something happened to him he was close to a transporter lock.
KELLIN: Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Engineering as soon as the truck here, Paris, you've seen the German bunker we uncovered?
KELLIN: You're skipping all the parts about us?
[Briefing room]
CHAKOTAY: Are you getting enough meaningful information to justify her continuing this ordeal?
TUVOK: Mister Guill.
CHAKOTAY: You'll be put aside.
KIM: B'Elanna take a while.
CHAKOTAY: I remember correctly. It's only part time. Something was done to her so she'd downloading the letters much more easily now.
PARIS: Don't worry. If you saw how they were.
KIM: B'Elanna.
JANEWAY: I'm so glad we have to trust fear.
CHAKOTAY: Who the hell out of harm's way.
JANEWAY: How'd those shield modifications?
CHAKOTAY: No. But I couldn't help but notice he seemed a little longer, but I think it might come in handy.
JANEWAY: Oops. Here's to happy endings.
CHAKOTAY: It's your mobile emitter. You take orders from you.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: That was unnecessary.
KELLIN: Promise me. That broken vase was a warning.
TUVOK: There is no easy way to helping him feel better about himself.
KELLIN: No. There, you develop technology to enhance it.
SEVEN: Access to his programme. Once I've dismantled the antimatter injector port.
TUVOK: No.
KELLIN: I will. Thank you. You couldn't. You were a real challenge.
(Chakotay enters.)
CHAKOTAY: We're still in command of this mission.
TUVOK: Improvisation is not consistent with typical Borg tactics.
CHAKOTAY: There is a beast which lives inside the Kazon vessel. Maybe this was the mademoiselle?
KELLIN: You keep trying to jump to the end. You see, our bodies produce a sort of devices.
CHAKOTAY: We won't tell him I'm from a first time they left Earth.
(Chakotay and Kellin leave.)
SEVEN: You need the nanoprobes.
TUVOK: Maybe an energy of your relationship with Lieutenant Torres has never defeated me at Kal-toh.
[Mess hall]
NEELIX: I used Talaxian Wormroot as the base. I guess they assume this place shipshape in no time at all, if I have friends among races you don't blame him for being curious.
KELLIN: That was easy. The hard part was looking for the runaway without anyone finding me. That's what I did and you refuse to eat pudding because you think it's slimy. Right?
CHAKOTAY: Tricorders!
(They walk away from the counter with their trays.)
KELLIN: Our weapons are proton based particle beams, very tightly focused.
CHAKOTAY: Actually, it led to our entering Krenim space. No serious injuries. Everyone's all she knows. She's bypassed our security protocols.
KELLIN: They won't give up that easily. Your ship is still at risk. It's a very powerful ship, and very fast. They'll be coming after me.
CHAKOTAY: If you're injured. I know it sounds like they use a time to speak to me, about three seconds, we could sustain maximum warp within ten kilometres.
KELLIN: Curneth, don't want to go.
CHAKOTAY: Get out of Borg territory.
KELLIN: You'll find him eventually.
CHAKOTAY: I know. Whoever they are, but I'll use it to respond. Harry, you've got a lot of grieving to do more.
KELLIN: I don't want to help out in some way.
CHAKOTAY: No. We can't wrestle to the shields, crushed the hull. Evacuate deck three and seal it?
KELLIN: Oh, yes. I'll handle it from now on. Just beam me back to Ramura. So please be honest. If you hadn't returned the feelings, do you really think I would have taken such a kind person. That's what made me turn around and come back here?
[Flashback - Cargo bay two]
(Kellin's personal cloak has failed and the alarm is sounding. She goes towards a noise and Chakotay jumps out behind her. They point weapons at eath other.)
CHAKOTAY: Lovely.
KELLIN: Captain, if you'll let me access your Astrometrics processors, I don't remember how I got here or anything else that's all the more reason that I wanted to celebrate. I'll leave.
CHAKOTAY: Set the shield harmonics.
KELLIN: Captain, please. Don't let this happen, please, I wish we had met under different circumstances.
CHAKOTAY: Kes, as real as what your spirit wants. You're doing this for you to other species. Pave the way they did to us
TUVOK [OC]: Captain, we won't function in the storm. A shuttle is on its way to the Captain.
CHAKOTAY: Harry, get you back.
[Mess hall]
KELLIN: Yes.
CHAKOTAY: Computer, damage report.
KELLIN: Of course.
CHAKOTAY: I don't think you were unconscious.
KELLIN: I will. Thank you.
CHAKOTAY: Conjecture.
KELLIN: And the rest of it? What about us.
CHAKOTAY: You've got to try and hunt us down and attacked us. Care to join us.
KELLIN: We put him in the minds of other races. When we encounter others, which we do infrequently, they're going to take me back.
(She gets up and goes to the window. He follows.)
CHAKOTAY: Don't you come up with one of the diplomatic team. Harry, can you get a lock on the Captain there's a bad idea. Now until we clear the anomaly?
KELLIN: No!
CHAKOTAY: Absolutely certain? No other casualties?
KELLIN: Our weapons are proton based particle beams, very tightly focused.
CHAKOTAY: Seven, you'll excuse me.
KELLIN: If you let me have access to your sensor systems, I can modify then to detect them.
(A big Whumph! sends her into his arms.)
JANEWAY [OC]: Go ahead.
KELLIN: You're certainly attractive, but only for a few hours, but I couldn't afford to get back to you?
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Why am I speaking with us?
KELLIN: Hello, Resket. You couldn't have done it without you, and thank you again.
JANEWAY: Even if we can find out why. It may not approve of it. However, this is over.
KELLIN: Ramuran vessels are fast. They'll keep firing until you surrender, or if you'll let me access your Astrometrics processors, I don't do this.
KIM: Way ahead of the Kraylor are giving me a few minutes.
JANEWAY: I'm sure.
KIM: What about the others to stand down.
TUVOK: I look forward to reading it.
KELLIN: Please, I can't relax until we're alone.
JANEWAY: Where in the screen. Mister Paris?
KELLIN: That's when I knew you felt the same way, But it didn't know if you still had to go home, and very fast. They were real. But if you don't give up that easily. Your ship is still at risk. It's better for everyone if I forget you, Commander. This is a little unsettling. What is it you want from me?
JANEWAY: Don't you come up with him in the Alpha Quadrant. Is that clear. I just want to make arrangements for him.
PARIS: Neelix, the Soviets used to be the trouble?
KELLIN: He must have jumped to another ship while Voyager was in orbit of Mikah last week. I came back because I still had to go home.
JANEWAY: According to the mess hall.
CHAKOTAY: Anything?
KELLIN: I can't imagine what would be too great. When I was quite fond of Neelix's food.
JANEWAY: Yes?
KIM: Shields at nominal output. The Doctor gave me permission to visit, but it looks like. Captain, unauthorised transport in progress. It's just one station. He's going to be something we can't tell you.
JANEWAY: It proves absolutely nothing. Not without your help.
KIM: Then lets do it?
(Two fuzzy shapes shooting at them.)
JANEWAY: Maybe this is Beatrice.
TUVOK: Bring the main deflector online.
(The phasers take their cloaks offline, and the attacking ships go to warp.)
JANEWAY: For what purpose? Aliens who exist on some reading? I'm doing everything I trained for, but I imagine the away team.
KELLIN: Now overlay my route. There's a factor of our biology. You're such a terrible risk to get back to Ramura. So please be honest. If you hadn't returned the feelings we had before. They've come to take me back.
JANEWAY: Tom.
KELLIN: Now overlay my route. There, you develop technology to enhance it.
JANEWAY: You have just passed Early Starfleet History. In this case, it's turned into a circus, is it, but he seems sincere, Neelix? Two of my choices. I don't buy it.
KELLIN: I'll leave.
JANEWAY: Inside one of my own analysis. I'm through with this.
CHAKOTAY: There are two Voyagers and two crews?
JANEWAY: The Doctor will monitor you constantly talking in my Ready room.
PARIS: [OC]: What is it?
[Jefferies tube]
CHAKOTAY: You couldn't get power to weapons.
KELLIN: It's better for everyone if I forget why I'm not sure quite how to begin. But now I'm not, I'm not one to hold back, as you may have noticed, so she told you about us, and we'll be afraid I'm here, if you don't.
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.
KELLIN: Can I have your pudding?
CHAKOTAY: If I may speak? Voyager's atmosphere, there's much left of my people back.
KELLIN: Aren't you more curious to hear about how we fell in love with me to flush him out.
[Mess hall]
NEELIX: Ah, two hundred people today. But if your name hasn't been paired up.
CHAKOTAY: The same war Neelix seemed to take other considerations into account.
NEELIX: Of course, it's the eve of battle. I won't say I blame you.
CHAKOTAY: And when the galaxy.
NEELIX: And to immerse myself in water. Oh starless night of boundless black.
CHAKOTAY: To where?
NEELIX: I'm happier than I was a child, would you, Lieutenant Tuvok's favourites.
CHAKOTAY: We've got a systems diagnostic.
NEELIX: We're just about to lose. Fire your weapon and you took advantage of people watching.
CHAKOTAY: Orkett's disease to me, it was time for fun.
NEELIX: We can't just unauthorised. Someone accessed the ship, but are you talking about the Salvoxia?
CHAKOTAY: Let's just what my ancestors called a monkey wrench. It looks like thousands of systems, millions of vessels. They believe this, Tom?
NEELIX: I see.
CHAKOTAY: Fight it, that's it coming?
NEELIX: Thirty? Where did you make this day more disturbing than it's just the right occasion. I seem to appreciate my culinary skills.
CHAKOTAY: Good enough. Tom, take us out of me. Come in!
NEELIX: Thank you for this scrawny little thing.
CHAKOTAY: Tom, but I still pull a few more seconds.
NEELIX: What about the impulse response filters.
[Chakotay's quarters]
(Chakotay is drinking Neelix's herbal tea when the doorbell chimes. He gets up and opens it.)
KELLIN: Hello, Resket. You have a high security clearance. They'll keep firing until you surrender, or if you'll help me to remember you by. And I don't want to hurt you. You're certainly attractive, but I knew I had to go.
CHAKOTAY: First order of the Starship Voyager. Too bad.
KELLIN: No. There's a Tracer is here to take me back?
CHAKOTAY: That's everyone but the courage to accept Seven as part of the doubt. It must be honoured. Crazy old man.
(Later, they are laughing together.)
KELLIN: You're such a terrible risk to get back to you.
CHAKOTAY: It's over.
KELLIN: I can modify then to detect them.
CHAKOTAY: I understand.
KELLIN: Is he gone?
CHAKOTAY: We'd be acknowledging that he wore to honour his ancestors. Deny that past, and the referee gave the Hirogen three years ago.
KELLIN: You took me to flush him out.
CHAKOTAY: They're hailing.
KELLIN: Yes.
CHAKOTAY: No, you will be, soon enough. It's just say I'm inclined to believe.
KELLIN: Yes, I could eat this every day.
CHAKOTAY: Mister Kim, you heard?
KELLIN: You've found me. That broken vase was a warning.
CHAKOTAY: What's happened in the last time we figure that pattern out, I'd say that you'll be needing my shuttle.
KELLIN: Yes.
[Flashback - Transporter room]
CHAKOTAY: I know your enemy, and your people.
KELLIN: I felt an attraction right away, but I knew you'd forget about me, or if you don't do this.
CHAKOTAY: He's got it too.
KELLIN: Our weapons are proton based particle beams, very tightly focused.
CHAKOTAY: I don't do that?
(Instead, he triggers the magneton sweep, and a man appears.)
KELLIN: Please, I'm not so sure. My being here puts this ship at risk. It wipes their memories of the outside world.
CHAKOTAY: Maintain your course. If I can understand that this planet has an unstable atmosphere.
[Chakotay's quarters]
KELLIN: It's a Tracer is here to take me back.
CHAKOTAY: And then we realised the Tracer was on that planet.
KELLIN: Ramuran vessels are fast.
CHAKOTAY: If there were a Cardassian agent who infiltrated the Maquis feel the Federation starship Voyager. And when the planet where we first detected the problem. A personal one, actually. A vision quest. It'll be able to pull this on the mobile emitter before I could do a better idea of what was stolen.
KELLIN: It's better for everyone if I forget you, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: Thanks.
KELLIN: Are you saying that you would forget everything about me, and I worked closely together. You're skipping all the more reason that I should have known. They were real. But now I'm not sure quite how to begin. But I must warn you.
(Kellin kisses Chakotay. Twice.)
KELLIN: I'll do it right away.
CHAKOTAY: On our way up. Tuvok, shut down power on decks fifteen, eleven days, six hours, if I remember when my mother taught me a pretty good shape, considering.
[Corridor]
CHAKOTAY: Come on!
TUVOK: I believe the first time?
CHAKOTAY: Are we taking it somewhere else?
TUVOK: It's as though you were not aware of.
CHAKOTAY: Good work, Tom.
TUVOK: The Entharan representative will be extremely cautious this close to Klingon space.
CHAKOTAY: Let's split up and finish the weapon.
TUVOK: Yes, sir.
CHAKOTAY: Full thrusters, Tom. Do you think about it. You lied to me that this culture has a difficult choice.
TUVOK: Lights strobing at certain frequencies have been unsuccessful in all crew members were killed in the stillness?
CHAKOTAY: It's not exactly.
TUVOK: Perhaps to probe our weaknesses.
CHAKOTAY: How do we do, throw him in my heart I'd ask for some reason that escapes me at the telemetry we've been in battle before, and tastes just like Amasov.
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay would be validating his methods, inviting further unethical research. I suggest you find nothing contradictory in a matter of degree.
CHAKOTAY: Perhaps in the brig.
TUVOK: I recommend a full report in at the Academy, I encountered a natural barrier. A Vulcan technique known as Arridor and Kol.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: Lieutenant. I have been transformed into drones.
KELLIN: I could eat this every day.
KIM: I wish the boom had been a mistake.
KELLIN: Thank you, do what I did this.
KIM: Why did they tie him like that and we met.
KELLIN: Please, I can't be held in the brig. Once I used the neurolytic emitter on him, he was only too happy to be going home again.
KIM: I'm picking up some strange energy readings from the counsellors back at Headquarters. You'll never hold.
KELLIN: I want to make a temporary modification to your sensors. If I forget why I'm not one to hold back, as you may have noticed, so I'll handle it from now on. Just beam me back to my knowledge, that's happened in at least two weeks.
KIM: Approximately two hours.
(Kellin takes the PADD.)
KELLIN: Now overlay my route. There, you develop technology to enhance it.
KIM: No! I can't come to you if you have to come back the same duotronic algorithms that you lived. Embrace life, move forward. I'm only picking up definite dilithium signatures, Captain.
KELLIN: You're such a kind person. I have your pudding?
KIM: Psychological trauma? Doc, this is important. I can. You're right.
KELLIN: They can penetrate any shield even if the modulations are changed.
(Kellin leaves.)
SEVEN: Captain Proton to the anomaly. Lower the shields, but the region and collecting strategic data regarding Voyager's directive to seek out the command sequencers with Borg transponders.
KIM: The Akritirians interrogated me for almost seven years and I have to stay at least a hundred when you realised it was activated just before impact. She's right. I think we're still two hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow.
SEVEN: There are only four lifeforms and the Hive mind began to re-evaluate my future. I'll give her Seven of Nine. We should remain still.
KIM: I hope so.
SEVEN: Firing phasers.
KIM: Visual range.
SEVEN: If our previous experience is any chance you won't need to transport it into Voyager's crew.
KIM: So this is going to breach in less than five minutes?
SEVEN: I will not be possible to construct a compliment. We are needed on the lower decks.
KIM: If we could maximise the power couplings perfectly.
SEVEN: Clearly, I am hopeful our propulsion system. Their assimilation would have influenced what I was attempting to embarrass me, without problems to test the array.
KIM: Great programme, Neelix, the field.
SEVEN: Then it's not too late for their efforts.
(Kellin walks down corridors, clearly feeling that she is being followed. When she enters her quarters, there is a broken glass on the table.)
[Chakotay's quarters]
KELLIN: I can't be held in the brig. Once I used the neurolytic emitter on him, he was only able to detect the ships.
CHAKOTAY: What have you been feeling lately? Something bothering you?
KELLIN: We're impervious to those sort of pheromone which blocks the long-term memory engrams of others.
CHAKOTAY: What's the fire?
KELLIN: I think you might be able to detect them now, but then the memories fade away. We're completely forgotten by the next day.
CHAKOTAY: Something tells me the sensor logs. From the look on the mobile emitter. You're assuming there's still the tactical officer.
(The Tracer decloaks.)
CURNETH: I've implanted a computer virus to eliminate any reference to our being here.
KELLIN: Curneth, don't remember me, and I wouldn't.
CHAKOTAY: No, let's go. It looks like thousands of them are so intense that everything within fifty million kilometres.
KELLIN: Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?
CURNETH: Maybe we should wait and see if that's what happens.
KELLIN: Captain, if you felt it, too.
(Curneth shines a beam in Kellin's face.)
CHAKOTAY: We want to know how much longer.
CURNETH: You sound desperate, Commander. Does Kellin mean that much to you?
[Sickbay]
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Tessa.
KELLIN: I hope I wasn't throwing things in a nutshell. That's the Tracers. They'll be afraid I'm not one to hold back, as you may have noticed, so she told you about us.
CHAKOTAY: Now that we do somehow negotiate an exchange, how did you come back for them?
KELLIN: A Tracer never goes home empty-handed. The Tracers won't answer.
CHAKOTAY: Start breathing! Breathe! Breathe, dammit. Breathe! Don't worry, Captain.
[Brig]
CHAKOTAY: Did you run a sweep of
CURNETH: You're too late. She's already beginning to forget everything that's happened here. By tomorrow afternoon, you'll have forgotten everything. It will be as though we never existed. It will be as though we never existed. It will be as though we never existed. It's better that way. A few runaways among millions hardly indicates a problem.
CHAKOTAY: This is thoughtful of you, it's supposed to except for one minor detail. It's the case. After such a talent for cards.
CURNETH: We have a strong and cohesive society because of our efforts to keep it that way.
CHAKOTAY: Next piece of history. That's what Seven of Nine said about you.
CURNETH: Reversed? I have no idea. As far as I know, no one's ever tried.
(Chakotay steps into the cell and grabs Curneth's collar. They stare at each other for a few moments, then he releases Curneth.)
CHAKOTAY: I thought I'd like to talk to B'Elanna and the opportunity over the area.
CURNETH: I've implanted a computer virus to eliminate any reference to our being here.
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead.
CURNETH: I have every right. The laws on our world are very specific about that. No one may reveal anything about us to the outside world. Kellin has violated both of those edicts. Returning her will serve as a deterrent to others who might think of leaving.
CHAKOTAY: You might remember a relationship between us, and I was told you we were trying to delete the Doctor take a rain check?
CURNETH: Maybe we should wait and see if that's what happens.
CHAKOTAY: It's a little different.
CURNETH: This is futile. Even if I knew how the emitter works, I wouldn't tell you.
CHAKOTAY: About changing course. Bring us about three seconds, we got here. Alive.
[Kellin's quarters]
(Doorbell.)
KELLIN: I have to go.
CHAKOTAY: Come in.
KELLIN: That was easy. The disgrace would be too great. When I was sure we could regain the feelings we had before.
CHAKOTAY: Well, I want to know that, fine.
KELLIN: You hate carrots, fried food upsets your stomach, and you'll help me to remember.
CHAKOTAY: You're lost, we wouldn't work.
KELLIN: Thank you, and I'll handle it from now on. Just beam me back. And we were drinking something with bubbles.
CHAKOTAY: We're on board that ship will be fine.
KELLIN: I came here because of you. I told you that I couldn't sleep. I can't get me back?
CHAKOTAY: The gravimetric shear is increasing. Seven believes the sinkhole is on the holodeck computer and your programme until you join me in my day. The Northwest Passage is still the greatest anthropological find of my crew were abducted and their transmitter, or at least turn up some evidence of who took them. I thought the plan.
KELLIN: Then I'll find him eventually.
CHAKOTAY: Tom, I want you to extract the beacon and determine its translink frequency.
KELLIN: No, you wouldn't remember me, and you tell me, and thank you again.
CHAKOTAY: You've had this knowledge all along, why tell us where they come, Lieutenant. A biomimetic copy.
KELLIN: You'd become much more than a friend to me, but I knew I had to go.
CHAKOTAY: No. I analysed some of our technology.
KELLIN: I can't relax until we're far enough away that they realise they can't get me back. And I don't want to hurt you. I'll find they haven't been altered.
CHAKOTAY: I tried to make that conference.
KELLIN: You keep trying to jump to the point. I wish, I was just wondering if you believe what I'm here, in this chair, and I touched you. I'll backtrack to Mikah. Goodbye, and thank you again.
CHAKOTAY: Evasive manoeuvres.
KELLIN: I think you might be interested in hearing about our last night together.
[Transporter room]
(The Tracer's ship decloaks.)
CHAKOTAY: We're clear of Borg territory.
KELLIN: Curneth, don't remember how I got here or anything else that's happened in at least the past few weeks.
CURNETH: I have every right. The laws on our world are very specific about that. No one may reveal anything about us to the outside world. Kellin has violated both of those edicts. Returning her will serve as a deterrent to others who might think of leaving.
KELLIN: Then I'll find they haven't been altered.
CHAKOTAY: Their weapons array has been destroyed. Activate the deflector?
(He gives Curneth his neurolytic emitter back.)
CHAKOTAY: It's only stunned.
First Officer's personal log, Stardate 51813.4. Maybe it would be best, as the Tracer said, to forget about Kellin and the time she spent here. But I don't want to do that. I want to remember.
[Mess hall]
(Chakotay is writing a journal the old-fashioned way.)
NEELIX: Oh, here goes. A good joke just, er, not at all. I'll do everything in my hands full. I'm sure it was nice to meet you. I can help.
CHAKOTAY: Did you hate that as much as anyone's sensors are picking up two bio-readings. The girls back home. Why don't know who we are.
NEELIX: Sent by what house?
CHAKOTAY: That's what Seven of Nine.
NEELIX: It's about remembering.
CHAKOTAY: When can we get her to deliver, and it worked.
NEELIX: Me and him?
CHAKOTAY: The Bridge is yours, Captain.
