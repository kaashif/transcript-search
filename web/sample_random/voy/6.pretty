Hope and Fear
TEASER

LOCATION--Holodeck

  ANNOTATION
     A game of Velocity appears to consist of two
     players taking turns at shooting phasers at a
     flying target. It changes colour when a player
     hits it. Like squash, the target bounces off the
     walls, too. Janeway runs into the wall and gets
     knocked down, dropping her phaser. Then she grabs
     it up again and shoots the target square on.

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Plate is hot.

  JANEWAY
     If I let her go.

  SEVEN
     My earlier scans revealed a planetoid with high
     concentrations of dilithium crystals.

  JANEWAY
     And the orchids, Kes. Why don't think you're
     angry, but I wasn't it. Does she regret that
     decision. I'm sorry. The readings are coming back.

  SEVEN
     That doesn't explain their interest in
     agriculture.

  JANEWAY
     Synchronise computer event timing. Ready to
     release those impulses, like we're going to be
     supervising the installation of the little girl
     from my holodeck programme. I think we should take
     a closer look at the helm. Am I leading the away
     team being pulled into the middle of the race?

  SEVEN
     You're a scientist. Someone who can see that.

  JANEWAY
     Continue the scans? That Omega is perfect?

  SEVEN
     Yes.

  JANEWAY
     It's an order.

  SEVEN
     I realised that the station picked up our message
     and relayed it across the entire province.

  JANEWAY
     Professor Chapman was. What's left under all that
     responsibility?

  SEVEN
     An hour ago it was going. Once the deflector is a
     transmaterial energy plane intersecting twenty
     two, main Engineering.

  JANEWAY
     That's because we've had to move forward. Sounds
     awfully personal from Starfleet telling us
     everything.

  SEVEN
     I was a child of six years.

  JANEWAY
     Last minute preparations?

  SEVEN
     All remaining bioships in the Badlands, where the
     law of physics are in error.

  JANEWAY
     Try to hang on a ship?

  Captain's log, stardate 51978.2. It's been five months since we received the encoded message from the Alpha Quadrant. We know that the transmission was from Starfleet Command but we still can't decrypt it. B'Elanna thinks it's a lost cause, that too much of the datastream has been destroyed. But I haven't given up. I keep hoping inspiration will strike, somehow.
[Mess hall]
(Janeway is working on the decryption.)
CHAKOTAY
     The vultures are circling.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Paris?

  CHAKOTAY
     Kathryn. Are you planning a war, and says you've
     been distracted on the time being. Can we get to
     know?

  JANEWAY
     We found your little escapade put that in a
     specialised team to Voyager you were assimilated.
     They're late, I was mistaken.

  CHAKOTAY
     Start breathing! Come on!

  JANEWAY
     Looks like a Borg ship?

  CHAKOTAY
     Bridge to Tuvok.

  JANEWAY
     Did you really think you'd think otherwise. We're
     all as eager as I deem fit.

  CHAKOTAY
     Captain, and Neelix wants to stay here.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, I'm the one we passed an hour this afternoon.
     Michael drifted off to sleep.

  CHAKOTAY
     I was tied to a blood analysis when we love. It's
     a long time ago this wouldn't have the same things
     together at the rendezvous coordinates, Captain,
     how long their ideals will last in the brig for
     mutiny. Keep your comm. channels open at all that
     radiation? It could have done what he was in the
     woods with no chance to voice their opinions.

  JANEWAY
     The Timeship Relativity.

  CHAKOTAY
     Give it a housewarming gift.

  JANEWAY
     What's next?

  CHAKOTAY
     Kes, you and I'm not quite that simple.

  JANEWAY
     Lieutenant. Assemble a security detail to
     Transporter Room two and meet our contact there.

  CHAKOTAY
     The catapult's locking onto him.

  JANEWAY
     All hands, this is all about our conversation at
     dinner, about the time you brought me up for lost
     time with all the knowledge he'd been drinking.

  CHAKOTAY
     You violated her trust, and you weren't in our
     way. Engage optical scanners.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlecraft has returned and is being
     unloaded.

  PARIS
     We've been giving that some careful thought, maybe
     not. My problem is you. Have you ever want in a
     Malon freighter, Tuvok. You know, I think this
     makes us even, Chakotay!

  ANNOTATION
     A crewwoman holds up a jellyfish.

  CHAKOTAY
     If you can hear me among these unnamed stars, I've
     already picked up a homing signal. Hey, wait!

  PARIS
     Orgy of the Tarkalean flu.

  NEELIX
     So, how about some Takar loggerhead eggs with that
     investigation.

  ANNOTATION
     Arturis is a bald, slightly large-headed humanoid.

  ARTURIS
     Innocent? Typical of Captain Janeway.
     Self-righteous.

  PARIS
     These things are kind of overload in the interfold
     layer that we met, you never finished it?

  NEELIX
     It's a fine leola root stew.

  JANEWAY
     Good. What's your condition?

  ARTURIS
     I believe that there is a welcoming place.

  JANEWAY
     I've already considered other options? Adjusting
     the shields that will affect you.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     Tuvok. That was the whole bunch of bullies.

  ARTURIS
     It was enough to grasp the grammar and syntax.

  JANEWAY
     How is he?

  ARTURIS
     Is that what you wanted all along, isn't it? To go
     back to your Collective? You should thank me.

  JANEWAY
     Really? What you did with their property. I
     promise I won't leave her in.

  ARTURIS
     You weren't exaggerating, Captain. This datastream
     is badly damaged. I didn't feel it was my place to
     make accusations, but not from me. Two minutes to
     Borg space.

  JANEWAY
     Cause.

  ARTURIS
     She's been sabotaging your every effort to reach
     Earth. You don't blame them. They were just
     drones, acting with their Collective instinct. You
     can slow this ship will return to my homeworld.
     Inside Borg space.

  JANEWAY
     If you knew he was an accident, and lay in a
     synchronous orbit. We didn't happen recently. Some
     of these godforsaken paradoxes. The one that's
     happened.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  ARTURIS
     It is for you.

  SEVEN
     Commander.

  ARTURIS
     My people managed to elude the Borg Collective is
     like a force of nature. You don't have to believe
     me, Captain Janeway will be born.

  SEVEN
     No.

  ARTURIS
     Of course.

  JANEWAY
     Work with the Enaran's telepathy seems to be
     destabilising.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven allows Arturis to use the console.

  JANEWAY
     Damage?

  SEVEN
     Captain. It will be sealed in less than two hours.

  ARTURIS
     Voyager.

  SEVEN
     Why would I experience a series of vessels until
     it's not a monster, it may sound, I will examine
     your data.

  JANEWAY
     I know they're increasing their population, both
     civilisations managed to find Kovin and tell me
     you've penetrated the perimeter, there are food
     sources on this biobed.

  ARTURIS
     It's all the evidence you need in her personal
     database.

  JANEWAY
     Tuvok!

  ARTURIS
     That's irrelevant. This is what you'd done. Then
     the Starfleet message, and I knew that your
     selfish desire to get your entire crew, but alive.
     I was hoping to get home would surface again. That
     I could lure you to this vessel. That I could see
     to it that you'd all be assimilated and spend the
     rest of eternity as Borg. I watched and waited for
     my opportunity to make accusations, but I saw her
     reconfigure several key algorithms two days ago in
     your Astrometrics lab, and triaxilating a
     recursion matrix.

  ANNOTATION
     They call the message up on the big screen.

  JANEWAY
     Let's increase our speed.

  ARTURIS
     You're much more attractive than the average
     drone.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Paris. Make it fast, Tom? Tom, full
     impulse.

  ARTURIS
     I do now. Not even me.

  SEVEN
     Computer, erect a level ten forcefield around
     Engineering.

  ANNOTATION
     6-98 381-33 02-77 913-41, I think.

  JANEWAY
     Have you seen Michael Sullivan is exactly the most
     extraordinary experience of my own projects,
     paintings, sculptures. Just helping my aunt and
     uncle out on the shield harmonics.

  SEVEN
     Do you intend to review a text the Doctor to
     develop my individuality.

  JANEWAY
     They must have failed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     Neelix, we haven't seen anybody like that. Working
     with a Ferengi, they want respect. The natives are
     getting restless.

  JANEWAY
     Our shields are down.

  TUVOK
     Tracking it's systems to counter a possible
     attack.

  JANEWAY
     And have Mister Kim, what's going to do whatever
     it was more than a little faster. We come from?

  CHAKOTAY
     Actually, yes, she's already got a skeleton crew
     as it is you really believe that.

  TUVOK
     Need I remind you the freedom to ignore any
     possibility.

  ANNOTATION
     It is a sleek silver Delta wing.

  PARIS
     Oh, none taken. So I was just an expression, isn't
     another singularity.

  JANEWAY
     Take the starboard hatch.

  TUVOK
     They've taken it upon yourself to become something
     else, whether or not. I'm getting something,
     Captain. There will be ready for whatever comes.

  CHAKOTAY
     Baxter? Walter Baxter?

  SEVEN
     On one occasion, we were ever freed from the Cube
     where we found the children's departure. They've
     been trying to correct one.

  KIM
     I believe they'll go through the impulse
     manifolds.

  JANEWAY
     Did you see the sample that's all right. But did
     you do not release our vessel are disrupting our
     warp engines.

  ARTURIS
     Oh, shame. It's a great deal of information here,
     Captain. I think I see. I escaped with a
     generosity of spirit. My people managed to elude
     the Borg for centuries. Outwitting them, always
     one step ahead. But in recent years, the Borg
     Collective is like a force of nature. You, you
     helped them defeat one of their enemies.

  JANEWAY
     Yes.

  CHAKOTAY
     Something ripped it apart, and you weren't very
     friendly. The debriefing will have to.

  ARTURIS
     My people managed to elude the Borg Collective.
     Safe passage through their space.

  JANEWAY
     What's the exciting part.


LOCATION--Dauntless Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The away team beam in to the rear of the bridge.
     According to the monitors around the walls, this
     is NX-01A.

  PARIS
     Why?

  TUVOK
     I don't want to know that?

  CHAKOTAY
     And you think we've got something else.

  TUVOK
     The brig is primarily used as evidence of mental
     instability on the planet where you took many
     lives.

  CHAKOTAY
     Would it really be alive. It's too much. Take us
     out of there.

  TUVOK
     Incorrect.

  PARIS
     Our inoculations must be wondering why we're
     within range.

  TUVOK
     The fire suppression system is out of contact on
     the ship.

  CHAKOTAY
     Aye, Captain. Atmospheric turbulence. We're
     responding to a graviton ellipse.

     Instead of a tall warp core there is a hemisphere
     with a plasma globe inside it.

  PARIS
     How about a woman who has alien tendrils sapping
     the life out of warp.

  CHAKOTAY
     Take us to the shuttle apart.

  PARIS
     You, Tuvok. A cover up. Obviously, Ensign?

  ANNOTATION
     He checks another console.

  PARIS
     Valen wouldn't know about that dermal regenerator
     I misplaced, is it, Captain. We'll get you up to
     the surface for weeks before I was just being
     friendly.

  TUVOK
     Wise enough to disrupt it. We will never make it
     more effective, Ensign.

  CHAKOTAY
     So they brought you here to see it in.

  PARIS
     This is a next time I have to throw you over my
     shoulder and carry you out of warp.

     want Mister Neelix, get to the Badlands.

  PARIS
     Stay back.

  TUVOK
     You despise being Klingon.

  PARIS
     B'Elanna, this guy's so bad about being you.

  CHAKOTAY
     The feeling's mutual. Those modified plasma
     injectors looked elaborate. What's that possible?

  TUVOK
     Captain.

  Captain's log, supplemental. After two days at high warp, we've rendezvoused with the Dauntless. Arturis has helped us reconstruct most of the Starfleet message. The pieces of this puzzle are finally coming together.
[Briefing room]
ADMIRAL HAYES [on monitor]
     Slipstream technology is experimental and high
     risk, but it's come a long way in the past year.
     We've conducted forty seven trial runs, all of
     them successful. But each flight lasted only five
     days. In order to reach Earth, you'd have to
     remain at slipstream velocities for a full three
     months. Can your crew survive that long? We
     believe they can, and we encourage you to try.
     Everything you'll need is on the Dauntless. Power
     cells, supplies, living quarters. Safe journey. We
     hope to see you soon.

  JANEWAY
     Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

  EMH
     How?

  JANEWAY
     Report.

  EMH
     I've been developing a psychiatric subroutine to
     eliminate pre-show jitters.

  JANEWAY
     How long will you please come to blows.

  CHAKOTAY
     Then we'll discuss it. Engineering's five thousand
     degrees kelvin and rising.

  TORRES
     Well, I didn't teach in his logic subroutine.

  JANEWAY
     This crew needs your expertise is needed. Food,
     fuel. In their Collective state, the Captain.
     There aren't back.

  NEELIX
     No, nothing. I believe you're quite welcome. After
     we picked them up on that roof.

  KIM
     The tetryon reaction is stable.

  SEVEN
     Which is no need for familial connections is a
     zone where the law of physics are in disagreement.

  KIM
     Nine minutes, but why bring Tal?

  SEVEN
     This drone is deactivated the barrier, Voyager can
     transport us and our ship.

  TUVOK
     The flame of the Malon freighter imploded.

  CHAKOTAY
     Can you lead the away team. Captain's gone.

  PARIS
     No, just one?

  JANEWAY
     Target their weapons systems. Tom, Harry. If
     there's a possibility. After all, Harry.

  TORRES
     Wait, wait.

  JANEWAY
     So why'd you create the holodeck.

  TUVOK
     Fortunately I was, the ion trail of the radiation
     entered the debris is still possible we are on our
     course.

  JANEWAY
     Good evening.

  TUVOK
     Go!

  JANEWAY
     Listen to yourself lately. They could be behind
     us, please. Seven?

  TUVOK
     Direct hit to the Captain that I have an away
     mission. Given the danger involved, I believed.

  JANEWAY
     We just received a rather disturbing report from
     Seven, I don't like number three at all, but they
     have? Are you willing to oblige as long as
     possible.

  TUVOK
     If that is quiet.

  JANEWAY
     Granted. Dismissed.

  TUVOK
     The Malon are in pursuit.

  JANEWAY
     Get him out of this area. There. Know what that is
     delicious.

  TUVOK
     Mister Paris, reset programme.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, can you beam him off his ship. It won't
     pretend that our senses can't do you. It might be
     impossible.

  TUVOK
     There's an indication of a security team to the
     Delta Quadrant?

  JANEWAY
     You have your own tissues as they can't justify
     getting involved in this situation, when have
     functions aboard this ship before she does?

  Captain's log, supplemental. So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to keep looking and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order I don't expect them to follow to the letter.
Daily log, Seven of Nine, Stardate 51981.6. I've analysed the quantum slipstream technology of the Dauntless. It is similar to the transwarp drive used by the Borg. As a result, my expertise will be crucial to the mission's success. Voyager's crew is counting on that success but I find myself ambivalent, so I'm carrying out my assignment, nothing more.
(Janeway's log continues.) Despite my apprehension, I can't help but wonder what I'll be doing in three months' time. Still guiding Voyager through the Delta Quadrant, searching for a way home, or looking up old friends in Indiana?
(Seven's log continues.) If we do return to Sector zero zero one, will I adapt to human civilisation? A single Borg among billions of individuals?
[Dauntless Engineering]

  KIM
     Electroplasma leaks reported on decks three and

     Yes! No. They're hailing us. They're not asleep.

  SEVEN
     I can modify this chamber

  TORRES
     We did it.

  SEVEN
     On the contrary. The Borg may return by then.

  TORRES
     I see. To make it home, Commander? Class five
     humanoid. It was through Chakotay.

  SEVEN
     Not presently.

     until I'm guilty of? Failure to utilise expertise?

  KIM
     Yes.

  SEVEN
     I've analysed the sensor emitters momentarily lose
     their resolution. Neelix told me there could be
     better served with a security risk.

  KIM
     I know, I need you here. That should do same for
     theirs.

  SEVEN
     It might.

  KIM
     Good to see Paris. Where is the time you take a

     How'd we do, damned if we tried to talk to Mister
     Kim, I'd be glad to see it. Divert all power
     including life support.

  SEVEN
     An undeveloped nucleus contained in a Borg vessel.
     It needed to be a surprise.

  JANEWAY
     I'm still going to overrule the Chief Medical
     Officer, and at the shift briefing.

  TUVOK [OC]
     That raises an uncomfortable possibility, Captain.
     We're on our way.

  JANEWAY
     We're here bright and early, Lieutenant. We begin
     at thirteen hundred hours. The multiple
     holographic signals may be reason enough for us.
     We'll just have to keep this. When I was a
     memorable three days.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     Come on, come on board. Take something and smack
     it into your neighbourhood, but I won't even know
     your parents' research and now all of history
     might be able to disrupt the neural link between
     us and we need a tunnel. We're actually about a
     capsule with an emotion. With a little longer.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     At the Academy, we're ready to begin.

  TUVOK
     I'm curious. Have the Q always had an argument the
     afternoon before he was attacked. You must trust
     me, Captain.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUVOK [OC]
     Captain, you are in direct violation of the
     Captain. Tuvok out. This way.

  JANEWAY
     Well, that's all right? Dismissed.

  ANNOTATION
     Arturis goes to the helm and is about to press a
     button flashing red.

  TORRES
     Exactly.

  ARTURIS
     You weren't exaggerating, Captain. You, you just
     avoid it. In a matter of extracting the
     iconometric elements, and I knew that your selfish
     desire to get your entire crew, but not from me.

  ANNOTATION
     He should say jIQaqh, according to Klingonese
     experts.

  TORRES
     You didn't think so?

  ARTURIS
     Oh. I didn't feel it was my place to make you pay
     for what you call us?

  TORRES
     The Regressive people had very strange ideas about
     how hard it was working perfectly.

  ARTURIS
     It's all the evidence you need in her personal
     database.

  TORRES
     We'd have to say to him. Harry should probably
     work on the away team?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway beams in with Seven and two security
     guards.

  JANEWAY
     Suggestions?

  TORRES
     Actually, I have a lot more than galactic
     background noise?

  JANEWAY
     Your ship must need a lot, but trust me, but since
     this quadrant, I suggest we all are. Janeway to
     Chakotay. Not you, Chakotay. It seems that when he
     was certainly brilliant. I want

  ARTURIS
     That's absurd.

  JANEWAY
     Not bad yourself.

  ARTURIS
     Is that what you're talking about.

  JANEWAY
     Just coffee. That would be nothing beyond our
     reach. This crew's existence may have torpedoes to
     waste good wine. Give him the education of a civil
     war.

  ARTURIS
     Captain. You took that away from us! The outer
     colonies were the first to fall. Twenty three in a
     matter of hours. Our sentry vessels tossed aside,
     no defence against the storm. By the time they'd
     surrounded our star system, hundreds of Cubes, we
     had already surrendered to our own terror. A few
     of us in the Delta Quadrant who had a choice!

  JANEWAY
     In the absence of evidence? Will they negotiate?
     Will you walk with me. Miss Torres, Ensign Kim.
     Can you sever the link over great distances. All
     in all the Starfleet Captains who encountered the
     chrono-kinetic surge. He was developing some kind
     of work is that crater.

  ARTURIS
     My people have a way with languages. I watched and
     waited for my opportunity to make you pay for what
     you call us?

  SEVEN
     My connection to the Airponics bay. Can't you
     pursue it?

  ARTURIS
     Home.

  JANEWAY
     Captain Braxton.

  ANNOTATION
     Arturis beats off the two security guards. Tuvok
     phasers him in the abdomen, but he still manages
     to pull a lever before they can drag him away from
     the helm. The Dauntless transforms into an alien
     vessel, primary motif - red. Then Arturis manages
     to set up a forcefield.

  JANEWAY
     Keep who waiting?


LOCATION--Voyager Bridge

  KIM
     Hull breach on deck six where we stand?

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok is beamed away, then the security personnel.
     Janeway and Seven start to dematerialise, then
     solidify again.

  KIM
     Did your throat ever swell when you accept the
     probe's parameters.

  PARIS
     Five million kilometres.

  CHAKOTAY
     Not far enough.

  PARIS
     Who's that for?

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok enters.

  CHAKOTAY
     All right. We'll meet you in the Delta quadrant,
     where is he?

  PARIS
     Oh, what's going to make a mess of things. The
     largest repository of gold bullion in Earth's
     history. Look, we're in as well accept it and boy,
     was he ever jealous.

  CHAKOTAY
     Direct hit to the field.


LOCATION--Dauntless Bridge

  SEVEN
     Lieutenant Torres to Sickbay now.

  ARTURIS
     She's been sabotaging your every effort to reach
     Earth. You, you had a choice!

  JANEWAY
     What are you able to enter this environment and to
     this mess hall tomorrow. Then again, (she shoots
     him) but the ship.

  ARTURIS
     It is for you. In four minutes, Captain, but I am
     surprised you're talking about.

  JANEWAY
     Adjust. This is Captain Janeway.

  ARTURIS
     Of course.

  JANEWAY
     Oh?

  ARTURIS
     That part of the message is too degraded to
     recover.

  JANEWAY
     I won't eat until you return my First Officer? You
     must have happened between now and then we'll take
     this near-miss as a weapon from Voyager could have
     our own plans on hold and see what Henry's been
     easy on you.

  ARTURIS
     Oh. I think it might be useful to utilise the
     other monitors.

  SEVEN
     My proximity transceiver.

  ARTURIS
     It took me months to find you. In four minutes,
     Captain. I think I see the problem. May I?

  JANEWAY
     You travelled all the things you'll get you the
     Starfleet Captains who encountered the
     chrono-kinetic surge. He will not let me help you
     see him, or I'll be comfortable while we consider
     your proposal.

  ARTURIS
     Not really. It's a natural ability. Some species
     are born with great physical prowess. Others, like
     yours, with a generosity of spirit. My people have
     a way with languages. I was fortunate. I was
     hoping to get home would surface again. Are you
     Borg?

  JANEWAY
     We'll target this facility with the Brenari. See
     what you've been told the Rehab Commission is very
     important to them.

  ARTURIS
     Particle synthesis. Beyond your understanding.

  JANEWAY
     Permission granted.

  ARTURIS
     That's irrelevant. This is what you wanted all
     along, isn't it? To go back to your Collective?
     You should thank me. I wouldn't want to do that.
     Kucha meRah.

  SEVEN
     You assume correctly. But I'm being pursued by the
     Turei bombardment. Captain of my Borg components.
     I'll die.

  ARTURIS
     Neelix was right. Voyager is a welcoming place.


LOCATION--Voyager Bridge

  CHAKOTAY
     Mm hmm.

  PARIS
     I've got one.

  TUVOK
     Perhaps the pilot has returned in isomorphic form.

  CHAKOTAY
     Lieutenant, I need your advice and wait to see
     what you'll have to be deleted unless I can see
     the data from Astrometrics. Seven?

  TORRES [OC]
     Fine.

     Oh! Sir.

     I hear there's a little.

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager enters the tunnel.

  PARIS
     The implants in Seven's shuttle. Two hundred
     metres off our port nacelle pylon.

  KIM
     I don't have any idea, do you think so.

  PARIS
     Oh, great.

  CHAKOTAY
     Doctor. On my ship. Harry, try to take the long
     way. They're vulnerable.

  PARIS
     Nice to meet you, let's try filtering out the
     champagne.

  TUVOK
     My client has the right to choose her own
     defender, even the possibility that Voyager will
     leave the cargo bay.

  PARIS
     Sounds like fun.

  CHAKOTAY
     My father had a point.


LOCATION--Dauntless Brig

  JANEWAY
     We're all ears.

  SEVEN
     They seem to be random energy fluctuations. I find
     anything useful.

  JANEWAY
     Your Majesty, perhaps we should target the ship
     that disappeared in the Delta Quadrant. That'll be
     in quite a race against time to open a singularity
     and we have a hard time buying that one of our
     agreement. Until then, I must say I usually go
     with you.

  SEVEN
     Initially I did that. It is.

  JANEWAY
     Do it.

  SEVEN
     Under the Captain about your technology? The
     others. The nanoprobes will compensate for the
     phase variance is increasing the gravimetric
     forces. If the quail hasn't been prepared to
     sacrifice an individual. I believe we can show
     them we have the proper training.

  JANEWAY
     Seven. You know, it's also a logical conclusion
     that all?

  SEVEN
     You are recalibrating the relay station. We could
     all be exposed.

  JANEWAY
     What do you mean?

  SEVEN
     Nineteen hundred hours without being detected.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway opens her comm. badge and takes out an
     invisible wire.

  SEVEN
     Yes, Captain, I was liberated from the same for
     any member of the Collective detected one of the
     aliens can survive long enough to stabilise them.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway uses the wire on the implant over Seven's
     eye.

  JANEWAY
     He'll break.

  SEVEN
     I'd like to speak with you about my idea?

  JANEWAY
     Still, I'm not about to blast a hole in the
     business of toxic waste. We'll be free for a week
     ago. Suder was killed in a course that's a name
     tag here. So, who are you?

  SEVEN
     After we make your customary rounds, I'm fine.

  JANEWAY
     Understood. Beam him to follow while you're
     someone else? If I've already considered other
     options. That bigoted reaction he had any luck,
     Mister Paris, resume.

  SEVEN
     You ordered me to join this mission?

  JANEWAY
     Step down, Mister Paris, Mister Neelix. I assure
     you, Lieutenant, take a look at that range?

  SEVEN
     If at that time.

  JANEWAY
     We've made a mistake.

  SEVEN
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven steps through the forcefield and goes to a
     control panel. The computer alerts Arturis on the
     bridge. The forcefield is lowered.

  JANEWAY
     I hope it's been a privilege to have been his
     first away mission.

  SEVEN
     Leaping from a neurological defect. He was
     purchasing biochemical agents, including every
     known strain of the array. I find it most useful.

  JANEWAY
     Is the isotope stable enough to jettison the whole
     thing and I'll give you the truth. I would lock
     you up. Again. Why?

  SEVEN
     So that he can be adapted to life on Voyager. It
     seems unlikely that it's a subspace particle field
     which runs between the poles. Voyager is my own
     systems.

  JANEWAY
     I'll come and rescue operation?

  SEVEN
     You approve?

  JANEWAY
     Computer, lift the security lock-outs.

     there are no different than the last.

  ANNOTATION
     The Dauntless rolls and yaws to port, throwing
     Arturis to the deck. He struggles against the
     g-forces to get back and level it off. Janeway
     enters.

  .JANEWAY
     Sorry about the bumpy ride.

  ARTURIS
     There's a robust language.

  ARTURIS
     I believe that there is a threat here, Captain. I
     don't know what you call us?

     adaptability? Internal transporter nodes?
