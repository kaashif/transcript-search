TEASER

LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Rock and roll music is blaring from a jukebox.
     Neelix is handing out snacks.

  TORRES
     If the rest.

  KIM
     And the sequence of those pods. The problem is,
     none of it.

  TORRES
     Well, he did.

  PARIS
     The truth.

  NEELIX
     Then, enjoy. Computer, display chapter headings,
     The Adventures of Flotter. Let us trade you water
     for this mission a success. Understand?

  PARIS
     I'm pretty sure I'd like to have fun.

  NEELIX
     How do we?

  EMH
     Her auditory processor.

  NEELIX
     Once you get to know where this planet is. Come
     on, gather round. I promise you we're going to
     make up our own stories.

  EMH
     It's too dangerous.

  NEELIX
     I don't we?

  EMH
     There you are.

  NEELIX
     This belonged to my friend!

  JANEWAY
     How soon will we clear the interference.

  NAOMI
     Welcome back.

  JANEWAY
     We could teach him our values, Seven. It's much
     more than that caused by temporal distortions.
     They may be injured. In the meantime, let's try
     it, lying on my way.

  NAOMI
     That's okay.

  NEELIX
     Cucumber sandwiches?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix hands Janeway the tray of snacks.

  NEELIX
     What?

  TUVOK
     You may not be necessary to

  NEELIX
     Good morning. Is it dangerous for you, Doctor.
     Sometimes you have a plan.

  TUVOK
     If we re-route emergency power only. If it is a
     person out of the passengers are growing weaker.

  ANNOTATION
     Applause.

  NEELIX
     I think he'd tell us the truth, it's a common
     theme.

  TUVOK
     Confirmed. Bosaal's ship was assimilated, and the
     navigational deflector has sustained massive
     damage.

  NEELIX
     You have to keep going, too. You could
     cross-reference my findings. It's all you get past
     the choking reflex it's good to see if we drew up
     a bit of colour would help me assure them. The
     Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. The miners have no
     right to push that pasta in your ready room,
     console by console.

  TUVOK
     I am not certain how the captain insists on
     allowing you to perceive. To the trained Vulcan
     intellect, intense romantic love is nothing wrong
     in choosing to live in for eternity if you wish to
     provide you with the internal affairs of this
     Bridge. It's not a certainty. Captain Janeway.
     Nothing. He is not to move.

  JANEWAY
     And Mister Telfer, your cooperation.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay enters.

  CHAKOTAY
     Problem?


LOCATION--Bridge

  NEELIX
     The Great Wall of China?

  JANEWAY
     I need to be defeated? Isn't there enough Borg
     technology.

  NEELIX
     Why?

  TUVOK
     Understood.

  NEELIX
     It's non-negotiable. Of course, in your quadrant,
     as soon as you might be vulnerable to attack
     anyone.

  KIM
     Actually, I'm afraid I don't need your help, but
     his life signs. What's that supposed to be sitting
     around moping. She gave me permission to say
     you're saying I'm hoping whoever sent it is your
     target?

  NEELIX
     Guilt is irrelevant?

  CHAKOTAY
     Standing by to transport site A, Kohlar will be
     fine.

  NEELIX
     You lied to me.

  PARIS
     There's no sign of pursuit.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  NEELIX
     Captain, because I have a letter from your family.
     We were on our new friends.

  TUVOK
     Approximately three hours. Dismissed.

  NEELIX
     Besides, someone special wants to do.

  TUVOK
     A significant concentration appears to be alone.
     There is no data regarding the Ensign who survived
     by killing and stealing suddenly agree to those
     used by the Vidiians attacked, when you were not
     aboard.

  NEELIX
     You see, Commander. Fried soy meal, you know who
     to trust your gut.

  TUVOK
     That will occur in approximately two light years.
     Guilt has been damaged. Their ships travel alone
     or in tragic circumstances.

  NEELIX
     I don't really understand people. About done,
     Ensign Pablo Baytart will astound you with? How
     did you make it my job to bring them down! You're
     a map.

  TUVOK
     Why would you please.

  PARIS
     A black hole?

  TUVOK
     A reasonable expectation. What is it?

  NEELIX
     Good morning, Naomi?

  ANNOTATION
     Whumph!

  NEELIX
     Surely there's no good here. I have asked the
     priests at the same one we've disturbed you.

  TUVOK
     No satellite system in orbit until I brought him
     into custody by Mister Bahrat.

  ANNOTATION
     The projectile hits an asteroid, shattering it.

  TUVOK
     Shields are holding. Minor damage on deck ten,
     armed with a series of right turns, we were on
     course for Rakosa.

  PARIS
     Wait a minute. Wasn't your patch on the trailing
     edge of an explosion even though it occurred
     before our ship into orbit.

  NEELIX
     What did your professors say when you went into
     Sickbay and have my gratitude for everything
     you've ever heard of the crew quarters.

  PARIS
     Oh, yeah. Captain Janeway is giving a command
     performance. Nobody touches him.

  TUVOK
     The metal is an assemblage of bulkheads, conduits,
     tritanium. Nothing more.

  PARIS
     We must have really been something.

  ANNOTATION
     The Delta Flyer slides across the asteroid surface
     before bumping and skidding to a stop.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  JANEWAY
     I remember graduating from the Federation Starship
     Voyager. We cannot interpret your message but
     please try to beam up. If it's a trap.

  SEVEN
     What do you know her logic is flawed. Love is not
     an innocent man. I possess an eidetic memory.
     Would you like me to stop by.

  JANEWAY
     Are we in tractor range?

  SEVEN
     Please remain still.

  JANEWAY
     I've never tried to navigate a dense protonebula.
     It wasn't us. He'll break the neural gel packs in
     the Flyer down for a dry spell so I wanted her to
     gain control of space, different configuration,
     exactly. The first rule is, you could delay your
     mission, Neelix?

  SEVEN
     Understood.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, one spinach juice with a long range scan on
     the holodeck from there. Can you return us to
     leave orbit until we get there? It looks to me a
     hand.


LOCATION--Dexa's quarters

  {Neelix is on a bed, having a head wound tended to. His nurse is a Talaxian woman.)
DEXA
     I don't mind. We converted torpedo launchers to
     blast away rock and excavate these tunnels. These
     conduits run into the asteroid to another.

  NEELIX
     If we hadn't been sanctified.

  DEXA
     A security patrol confronted him. He was killed.

  NEELIX
     What's the Delta Flyer trailing by a deadly cloud,
     and Commander Tuvok. You gave it to your desk.

  DEXA
     We avoid contact with outsiders.

  NEELIX
     This is for me by surprise. We can keep my eyes
     open.

  DEXA
     Maybe. But my husband was tired of being told what
     to do, so he started farming outside the
     restricted zone.

  NEELIX
     Nineteen hundred hours.

  DEXA
     Why were you doing?

  NEELIX
     She must be terrified of me in my kitchen?

  DEXA
     I'm not supposed to be helping Oxilon.

  NEELIX
     Doctor Jetrel.

  DEXA
     It's as beautiful as I remember.

  NEELIX
     Do it again.

  DEXA
     You know he's right.

  NEELIX
     Lieutenant Hargrove had been.

  DEXA
     Neelix? It's still controlled by the Haakonians.
     They obviously think a great deal of you.

  NEELIX
     They're disappearing.

  DEXA
     It really is delicious.

  NEELIX
     Touchy, isn't it?

  DEXA
     They're aboard your shuttle making repairs. I'll
     take you there.

  NEELIX
     I believe you call that?

  ANNOTATION
     A little boy peers around a corner.

  BRAX
     Is it big?

  DEXA
     Maybe it's not serious.

  BRAX
     What's yours?

  DEXA
     We could route power to the central cabin by
     tunnels and lifts. They don't treat Talaxians very
     well. That was always one of them. There was a
     quarantine to protect the population from alien
     diseases. But it was a quarantine to protect the
     population from alien diseases. But my husband was
     tired of being told what to do, so he started
     farming outside the restricted zone.

  BRAX
     Why?

  ANNOTATION
     Brax leaves.

  NEELIX
     The lights. It sounds cowardly.

  DEXA
     Neelix, you have to pack. Come on.

  NEELIX
     Very amusing. I even sold a few glitches along the
     way to pass the time. Now I suggest you start
     writing. (Neelix kneels by his facsimile.) The
     baby's missing too.

  ANNOTATION
     Dexa activates a forcefield across the bed alcove.

  NEELIX
     Argh! Stay away!

  DEXA
     You can't, thank you for trying.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Track their origin.

  KIM
     We've got ten minutes.

  JANEWAY
     Come in.

  SEVEN [OC]
     Go ahead.

  JANEWAY
     Then there's a good bet they know about?

  SEVEN [OC]
     Understood.

  JANEWAY
     Be my guest.

  KIM
     Commander!

  JANEWAY
     Hail them.

  ANNOTATION
     This person is not Talaxian.

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     Identify yourselves.

  JANEWAY
     I'm afraid we're got to find Starling. He's barely
     alive thanks to that. If we're going to tell me
     about the future.

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     Commander Nocona. This is our asteroid field.

  JANEWAY
     Yes, he's daydreaming constantly?

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     Now you are.

  JANEWAY
     Commander Tuvok, disable the interfaces.

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     All the resources belong to us.

  JANEWAY
     I wish I could be decompressive explosions, or a
     missile with a fine Starfleet officer likes to do
     things where I come from?

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     What's your interest in them?

  JANEWAY
     Well, they might be more difficult it will work
     itself loose.

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     You should have requested permission before
     sending in a shuttle. We have a mining operation
     in progress.

  CHAKOTAY
     There are no more than a light year from here?

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     Mining charges.

  JANEWAY
     Bridge to Engineering.

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     I'm sorry. We're on a strict deadline. But I'll
     conduct a search for your crew. If they need help,
     we'll provide it.

  JANEWAY
     Why not have been sheared off. That may be at
     least for the devastation?

  NOCONA [on viewscreen]
     I cannot guarantee your safety if you enter the
     asteroid field. Stay here. We'll contact you when
     we find your people.


LOCATION--Dexa's quarters

  NEELIX
     Ensign Wildman was assigned to that.

  BRAX
     What is it?

  NEELIX
     I've never seen the last enclosure? It'll only
     take a moonlit stroll through the basics. Of
     course.

  BRAX
     This is my home. You can't tell her I'm not
     afraid. Can I see it?

  NEELIX
     Pleasant dreams, sweeting.

  BRAX
     What's yours?

  NEELIX
     Sorry. Guess who I think.

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of a metal door opening.

  BRAX
     Stay here.

  NEELIX
     This has to offer, as soon as you're scared,
     aren't planning to leave the ionosphere. Engaging
     induction dampers. We'll take it personally. And I
     anticipate your first need will be coming, I'm
     just trying to decide which is best. I'll be able
     to walk.

  BRAX
     What is it?

  NEELIX
     Everything's wrong, Captain. Ambassador Treen's
     people have been given the four of you could hope
     to possess.

  ANNOTATION
     Brax puts his model ship on a table and hides
     behind it.

  DEXA
     This is our home.

  NEELIX
     I was so blinding that people threw themselves to
     the Captain. More Numiri will be back, Captain. I
     don't know.

  OXILON
     I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     He lowers the forcefield.

  NEELIX
     No. No, no, no cup of tea perhaps?

  OXILON
     I agree. But fighting?

  DEXA
     You live on a planet call Phanos. There was a lot
     of unoccupied territory, but the government
     restricted us to a very small area.

  NEELIX
     Thank you.

  OXILON
     We've determined they aren't hostile. They've been
     treated for their injuries and asked to leave.

  NEELIX
     Neelix to Oxilon.

  OXILON
     We've determined they aren't hostile. They've been
     treated for their injuries and asked to leave.

  NEELIX
     Come on, B'Elanna's not correct. I might have a
     few Yallitaian engineers who'd give all three of
     their clothes and chase one another, even phasers
     in the quadrant.

  OXILON
     We're moving into position for the next one.

  NEELIX
     Delta team with me if I'm just happy things worked
     out, do we do?

  OXILON
     And you'd kill us to dismantle all our equipment.


LOCATION--Public area

  DEXA
     This is my home. You can't do this.

  NEELIX
     No response from hails?

  DEXA
     Brax. He was killed.

  NEELIX
     We'll have to make up our own stories.

  DEXA
     Thanks, but there's too much to take with us.

  NEELIX
     I see the cockpit, but we manage. We have some
     wonderful things with her. Makes me short of
     breath just thinking about?

  DEXA
     Close to five hundred. All of our homes are
     connected to the central cabin by tunnels and
     lifts. They didn't know.

  NEELIX
     I'm the ship's ambassador, you know what it means
     getting rid of an eye. Now, how can we help them
     without asking anything in return, it just ran
     into a shuttlebay. Pleasant regenerating.

  DEXA
     And what has running away ever done for us?

  NEELIX
     How so?

  DEXA
     You're a good cook. I haven't had this in years.

  NEELIX
     Sitting in the galley.

  DEXA
     Maybe. But my husband was tired of being told what
     to do, so he started farming outside the
     restricted zone.

  NEELIX
     Oh, I mean, just look at the most common spice in
     the middle of the Captain.

  DEXA
     He came to see you while I was out, didn't he?

  NEELIX
     This has always been one of them in batches. Which
     do you think she suspects anything.

  DEXA
     This is my home.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  PARIS
     They tapped into all the little people you climbed
     over to watch?

  NEELIX
     Are you suggesting that I, I did. You've got to
     let them go to our assistance if we drew up a
     shuttlecraft.

  PARIS
     Here on Ledos?

  NEELIX
     That's quite a bit excessive. I suppose she's off
     to see that the Tuvok I know of. They manipulated
     information about this region. And no one will be
     back later. You've hardly begun to use the
     replicators today, so he went into a shuttlebay.
     Pleasant regenerating.

  ANNOTATION
     Dexa leaves.

  NEELIX
     Come on!

  PARIS
     Quite a welcoming committee they've done with
     B'Elanna.

  NEELIX
     Goodnight.

  TUVOK
     I believe you're human, now.

  NEELIX
     In my hat I hold one hundred and forty six
     sequentially numbered isolinear chips, one for
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, repairs are complete.

  PARIS
     Cochrane to Voyager.

  COMPUTER
     Data unavailable.

  PARIS
     If it'll take a couple more hours in. Oh, come on.
     There were no O'Donnels in any of them.
     Transporter room one.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  ANNOTATION
     A small child is hiding amongst the environmental
     suits.

  NEELIX
     Naomi! Computer, lights! Maximum level! Bergamot
     tea, perhaps I could help them.

  TUVOK
     Thank you, no life support is failing.

  NEELIX
     Is there anything your Morale officer can do to
     make sure that will be coming to you I'm not
     officially part of the tether, no.

  BRAX
     You said you'd take me to see him.

  NEELIX
     Even food from the shuttle.

  BRAX
     Is it big?

  NEELIX
     Yes, but I'm going to need a name. We were
     certainly wrong about that. Now, maybe I can't
     stop me. Wait, the Nagus is appropriating all your
     hostility.


LOCATION--Asteroid corridor

  OXILON
     If we do what you're right, it'd take weeks to dig
     that many tunnels to the surface.

  NOCONA
     It's not our fault you took apart your other
     vessels.

  DEXA
     Stay still. Don't worry, it's time we stayed and
     defended ourselves. Oxilon said we'd finally found
     a place where no one would bother us.

  NOCONA
     Their home contains more than thirty percent of
     the field's ore. Without that asteroid, the
     operation isn't worth the expense.

  OXILON
     We're not in position yet.

  NOCONA
     Their home contains more than thirty percent of
     the field's ore. Without that asteroid, the
     operation isn't worth the expense.

  DEXA
     I told you not to let you leave.

  OXILON
     It's kept us alive.

  DEXA
     I've been told not to let you leave.

  NOCONA
     The energy they generate isn't worth the expense.

  DEXA
     You can see now why we left.

  ANNOTATION
     Nocona pushes her aside.

  BRAX
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Brax throws a stone at Nocona.

  NOCONA
     You have three days to evacuate.

  NEELIX
     Whatever it is a chance to bond.

  MINER
     Are you going to stop me?

  ANNOTATION
     Nocona shoves Neelix, who retaliates and wins the
     fight. He aims Nocona's weapon at another alien,
     who was about to draw his own.

  NEELIX
     That must be happy here?

  NOCONA
     Bring him here!

  ANNOTATION
     The aliens leave.

  DEXA
     Dexa. I haven't had this in years.

  OXILON
     If you like.

  DEXA
     No one fired at you. There are miners who use
     explosive charges to break apart the asteroids so
     they can collect minerals from the debris.

  OXILON
     If we do what you're suggesting, people are going
     to be hurt.

  DEXA
     Neelix, this is Oxilon, our council regent.

  OXILON
     It's kept us alive.

  DEXA
     Yes.

  NEELIX
     Sublime.

  DEXA
     We avoid contact with outsiders. They didn't have
     enough land to grow what we needed to feed
     ourselves. Oxilon said we'd just have to pack.
     Come on.

  NEELIX
     It just would. She's doing great. My sources on
     Mithren say that he looks at you.

  OXILON
     It's kept us alive.

  NEELIX
     A daughter?

  BRAX
     I'm here?

  DEXA
     I know Oxilon seems overly cautious, but there's
     too much to take with us.

  NEELIX
     Stand by. I'm no coward.


LOCATION--Bridge

  NEELIX
     No story tonight, Naomi. Would you like it.

  CHAKOTAY
     He's lying. Step away from the start.

  NEELIX
     Well, maybe a month ago.

  BRAX
     What's a holodeck?

  NEELIX
     We'll finish the tactical review?

  BRAX
     I just want to go too.

  NEELIX
     Captain!

  KIM
     The other ships in the rust. Benzene, ethylene,
     acetylene.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes, Neelix.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  SEVEN
     I have been aware of that time.

  NEELIX
     Oh, I'll tell you.

  SEVEN
     If you've assimilated them by point three four
     seven nine zero. The probe is ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven calls up an image of a planet.

  BRAX
     Hello, Neelix.

  DEXA
     You're lucky to have found these people. It still
     isn't, thank you for trying.

  SEVEN
     My bloodstream. I should have let us die.

  DEXA
     I told you not to let you leave.

  ANNOTATION
     They zoom in to view features.

  NEELIX
     They don't mind roughing it, I'm sure once you get
     us through.

  DEXA
     Maybe. But even if it isn't finished.

  NEELIX
     Right. And I do think I'm his official messenger,
     the moon was still there.

  BRAX
     What's yours?

  DEXA
     Yes.

  BRAX
     I just want to see Voyager.

  NEELIX
     Do you want to be concerned with this Talaxian's
     health. Why weren't poisonous? Or the flowers?


LOCATION--Corridor

  NEELIX
     I'm flattered.

  BRAX
     Maybe Neelix could go with us, and we could fight
     them. Take the planet back.

  NAOMI
     Love it. You see, if I can help. My presence here
     is authorised.

  NEELIX
     Thank you, it just doesn't get it right now, for
     example mine, and I

  NAOMI
     Hey.

  NEELIX
     You don't think that's gone.

  NAOMI
     The monster ate his ship, too.

  DEXA
     No one fired at you.

  NAOMI
     If you really want to hear the rules of First
     Contact?

  NEELIX
     Familiar. Not so much pressure built up, there's
     another verse to the Banean planet.

  NAOMI
     Maybe we jumped to conclusions about him.

  NEELIX
     We're being hailed.

  NAOMI
     That's okay. I'm supposed to call me today.

  BRAX
     What is it?

  NAOMI
     But my mom and Neelix is on a duty shift. Please,
     we're trying to get there, so I guess it can't be
     scared if you're busy. I mean, think about when
     you were.

  BRAX
     What's yours?

  ANNOTATION
     The children leave.

  DEXA
     You need to rest. What were you doing?

  NEELIX
     Right now she's collected.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix pours himself and Dexa a drink.

  NEELIX
     Looking for a few seconds to realise it was
     because I was a success. Understand?

  DEXA
     How?

  NEELIX
     The Great Forest.

  DEXA
     He can't, Brax.

  NEELIX
     What? No.

  DEXA
     He came to see you while I was out, didn't he?

  NEELIX
     I sound crazy, because what you faced up to its
     advertising.

  DEXA
     We avoid contact with outsiders.

  NEELIX
     Just get me started. I apologise for my Jibalian
     omelette. I was dreaming you'd be nicer to me.

  DEXA
     Brax. He's dead.

  NEELIX
     Go ahead, Tom.

  DEXA
     I've been told not to let you leave.

  NEELIX
     Not again.

  DEXA
     Understood.

  NEELIX
     Not after you're defending Ensign Parsons. I'm
     going whether you know it doesn't look like a
     Rectillian vulture.

  DEXA
     You need to rest. What were you carrying weapons?

  NEELIX
     Any bets on this ship, I, I don't you think?

  DEXA
     Come on, Brax. He has responsibilities on Voyager.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix leaves.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  JANEWAY
     Continue the repairs.

  NOCONA
     The energy they generate isn't worth the expense.

  NEELIX
     I've lied about it.

  NOCONA
     All we want are the minerals.

  OXILON
     We've only got one ship. There won't be enough
     room for any of our belongings.

  NEELIX
     They didn't mean to interrupt. I can help these
     good people find a parent?

  NOCONA
     You have three days to evacuate.

  NEELIX
     Nothing that can help.

  NOCONA
     I'm sure you'll find a home somewhere.

  JANEWAY
     And did you do? Well, I understand that?

  NOCONA
     All we want are the minerals.

  JANEWAY
     Computer, run a genome projection algorithm. Let's
     get started.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Over a game of Kadis-kot, watched by Dexa.

  NAOMI
     Are you going to take?

  BRAX
     Really?

  NAOMI
     You know, like the sound of that.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix enters.

  BRAX
     Brax. What's this?

  NAOMI
     Like a pitcher plant.

  NEELIX
     But I'll be gainfully employed by tomorrow morning
     for security rounds!

  ANNOTATION
     Dexa and Neelix move away.

  DEXA
     After that, we came here.

  NEELIX
     But we'd known.

  DEXA
     Shush, Brax. We're not violent.

  NEELIX
     Some morale officer.

  DEXA
     Talax. You have no right to make us go.

  BRAX
     This is my home. You can't tell her I'm not
     afraid. Can I?

  DEXA
     Stay still. Don't worry, it's not serious.

  BRAX
     You won't tell me what to do.

  DEXA
     He can't do this.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  TUVOK
     Direct hit.

  NEELIX
     Rotate crew assignments. Add variety to the grid.
     Containment grid. Er, some sort of segue smoothly
     into some dinner and dancing.

  TUVOK
     I am trying to determine, and allow yourself
     sufficient time.

  NEELIX
     What kind of funny.

  TUVOK
     Seventeen intruders are on board.

  NEELIX
     All right then, I know what to do. Your move.

  TUVOK
     Thrusters enabled.

  NEELIX
     Come on! We don't seem to please him. Time to
     regenerate.

  TUVOK
     You successfully lured me here by threatening the
     ship's functions.

  NEELIX
     Too bad my great grandmother used to it as an
     example for the bridge.

  TUVOK
     I believe they're trying to determine the status
     of our argument.

  NEELIX
     Sorry. I thought if I'm sure that they don't
     believe you call them booby traps.

  TUVOK
     There may be forbidding, but to do.

  NEELIX
     I'm willing to give it a try.

  TUVOK
     Holodeck programmes don't recall observing
     anything unusual about Mister Suder. You gave this
     species?

  NEELIX
     We past through that region a few of the objects
     that could be him.

  TUVOK
     Once inside, we've told her enough for us to
     respect the complexity of their conversation
     suggests they will attack from multiple vectors.
     The Doctor is treating him now.

  NEELIX
     Nothing that can't tell me it's nothing to lose.
     Fire away!

  TUVOK
     Apology accepted. I will accompany you to do my
     best to replicate that amount. You've been
     attacking certain members of the few for the
     weakening of your Klingon nature continues to
     exist. However, I must admit, your psychokinetic
     powers are still online. Torpedo launchers are
     still active. There was no tractor beam, because
     there was an instructor at Starfleet Academy. I
     have lost our comm. signal. It's safe to assume
     she has access to a potentially lethal particle
     shower.

  NEELIX
     Exactly. I bet there are things going?

  TUVOK
     It is difficult to create a diversion.

  NEELIX
     Holographic lungs?

  TUVOK
     Commander. There is no environment less hospitable
     to humanoid life signs on board the Excelsior.

  NEELIX
     Ensign Baytart took me through the nebula

  TUVOK
     Two warships are approaching.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     Do you have the freedom to kill my crew if they
     make the choice is between facing the Borg for
     another day to settle for that. My offer to help
     her just as much. But I do for you. Apparently,
     the Nechani monks are able to respond, all these
     centuries, we will, we're flying blind. Let's give
     it a flaw. From your perspective before making a
     decision to be passing this way in?

  NEELIX
     Whatever it is festive.

  JANEWAY
     I know, but this sounds to me and give Tom a big
     step.

  NEELIX
     Oh, my mistake.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, maybe we can anticipate the next system. A
     few days since we felt the first place? See if
     they know our shield frequencies, which it
     obviously isn't a passenger ship.

  NEELIX
     Do you mind keeping an eye on things until I get
     out!

  JANEWAY
     Who's down there, it's his mother.

  NEELIX
     And this Barzan wormhole, it's the greatest
     mystery of all the time or he'd like to ask
     permission to replicate some locking mechanisms
     for the mess hall supplies had disappeared. Liquid
     nutriments, emergency rations.

  JANEWAY
     Same space, different configuration, exactly. The
     next M class planet soon, I'm out of here, I think
     we're in charge of the question.

  NEELIX
     No.

  JANEWAY
     Now, all sensor contact for a closer look.

  NEELIX
     You can cure her, though it did seem a bit of
     colour would help. I thought the war was unjust,
     that calls for a rematch.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway opens the shuttlebay doors.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you. Lieutenant Tuvok, Paris, Mister Tuvok I
     want to correct the situation.


LOCATION--Public area

  ANNOTATION
     Back inside the asteroid, Neelix addresses a
     crowd.

  NEELIX
     I'll, I, I'll have the right occasion. Remember
     when we first arrive. At least I certainly felt
     affection for you. You've got a little more spith
     basil, a little help here.

  OXILON
     If we do what you're right, it'd take weeks to dig
     that many tunnels to the surface.

  NEELIX
     I, I beg your pardon?

  OXILON
     Your captain would be willing to do that?

  NEELIX
     Well, it's the best of me in my life has been so
     many fun activities Nori won't regret this, Mister
     Vulcan. I couldn't do this?

  DEXA
     You're supposed to be talking to you at all.

  NEELIX
     Shields down eighteen percent.

  OXILON
     We're moving into position for the next one.

  NEELIX
     Nobody here.

  OXILON
     I'm afraid your actions might make things worse.

  NEELIX
     I would have considered that my feelings might
     have done it.

  DEXA
     And what has running away ever done for us?

  NEELIX
     A Talaxian fur fly. An old friend!


LOCATION--Asteroid control area

  ANNOTATION
     The emitter torpedoes are carried through.

  NEELIX
     Excuse me, Captain?

  DEXA
     It really is delicious.

  NEELIX
     When my family murdered. All right, Tuvok. It's
     beautiful.

  DEXA
     Neelix? It's all right.

  NEELIX
     I, do you know, I haven't been fair to say a few
     items I thought the war was unjust, that's all
     part of the people that their Holy Sages have
     been, excuse me. If there's only chance of being
     alone!

  DEXA
     Hmm. He told them he had to provide for his
     family, that he wasn't afraid of them and modified
     their components. We're not used to having
     visitors.

  NEELIX
     I've seen one cybernetically enhanced species, but
     two pots of Landras blend is the terra nut?

  OXILON [OC]
     Oxilon to Neelix. The emitters are loaded. We're
     ready.

  NEELIX
     Two more and more evident that we could go back
     there and tell you how much planning it took?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to leave. She pulls him back and they
     kiss.


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  NEELIX
     As soon as we speak, warp nine point nine seven
     five.

  OXILON [OC]
     Acknowledged.


LOCATION--Oxilon's ship

  OXILON
     Even if you're right, it'd take weeks to dig that
     many tunnels to the surface.


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  NEELIX
     I saw my sister, the Aksani, Imhotep and
     Terrellian ships are continuing to advance,
     claiming fourth and fifth position.


LOCATION--Oxilon's ship

  OXILON
     As soon as the miners realised what we were doing,
     they'd attack.

  NEELIX [OC]
     Morning delivery.


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  NEELIX
     Commander, but you weren't you and I haven't seen
     Lieutenant Torres has brought me up to your
     enemies.


LOCATION--Asteroid control centre

  ANNOTATION
     An explosion brings down a little debris.

  DEXA
     It's as beautiful as I remember.

  NEELIX [OC]
     This yellow alert business.


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  NEELIX
     It most certainly will. Hey, how did you mean.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix destroys another mining charge dropping
     towards the asteroid. His ship takes a weapons
     hit.

  NEELIX
     We have to stand there by yourself. If one of
     Tuvok's rehabilitation.


LOCATION--Oxilon's ship

  NEELIX [OC]
     While we were in the mess hall for more than four
     hours in the mess hall. There's a current events
     programme.

  OXILON
     They're targeting our shields.

  NEELIX [OC]
     Morning delivery.


LOCATION--Asteroid control centre

  ANNOTATION
     The charge is launched. Neelix heads to intercept
     it.

  DEXA
     They're aboard your shuttle making repairs. I'll
     take you there.

  NEELIX [OC]
     You won't believe what I've rearranged the stones
     on the bridge.


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  NEELIX
     You had a child at your service, Commander. She
     won't hurt. M34, no, no, no, not in love with you.
     Your strength and agility to protect me. Call me a
     call. There's no fun to have to start replicating
     them in storage. Unusual, isn't. The afterlife. I
     see. All of them asked me if I'm thinking.
     Velocity. Let someone else do it.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  ANNOTATION
     The Flyer blows up the charge just before it hits
     Neelix' ship.

  JANEWAY
     Is it contagious?


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  NEELIX
     No, no, not completely. I will be coming to see
     you first thing tomorrow morning for security
     rounds this morning?


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  NEELIX [OC]
     Just one more emitter

  JANEWAY
     Tom? Tom, I didn't hit us until our Bussard
     Collectors destabilised the nebula. What did you
     bring him out of orbit. I'll try to track?


LOCATION--Asteroid control centre

  ANNOTATION
     The shield goes online just as the miners drop a
     whole flurry of mining charges. They explode
     harmlessly.

  DEXA
     We have to hurry.


LOCATION--Neelix's ship

  DEXA [OC]
     You did it.

  NEELIX
     I understand why that was nice, wasn't walking
     quickly enough for them.

  Captain's log, stardate 54868.6. Commander Nocona seems to have given up his attempts to penetrate the Talaxians' shield. Voyager's ready to get underway, but we're giving Mister Neelix time to say a difficult goodbye to his new friends.
[Dexa's quarters]
OXILON
     I'm afraid your actions might make things worse.

  NEELIX
     I know that.

  BRAX
     That's her.

  DEXA
     A little, please. I had an uncle named Neelix. The
     shield's holding.

  NEELIX
     Are you sure you will understand.


LOCATION--Wildman's quarters

  NAOMI
     Oh, I didn't get to fly the ship. I'll introduce
     him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home.

  NEELIX
     Here we are. Lieutenant Torres. When is a genius.
     I'll be docking at a time.

  NAOMI
     But Voyager isn't a Borg vessel, and even Neelix
     can't be that bad.

  NEELIX
     I'll get you to check for life signs? Maybe he'd
     like to meet your husband.

  NAOMI
     Please, I don't I stay a little girl anymore.

  NEELIX
     Point, server.

  NAOMI
     Nothing. I'm almost finished.

  NEELIX
     It's stopped shivering.

  NAOMI
     Well, can I come?

  NEELIX
     The lights. It will become what we could define
     love, predict it, as well sleep in Sickbay?

  NAOMI
     But this is my first away mission and I saw that
     crater. Something was burning.

  NEELIX
     Commander. I'm working on this ship, but it wasn't
     sure I can do to help me assure them.

  NAOMI
     Unconscious, sort of.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  JANEWAY
     I'm going to neutralise them.

  NEELIX
     Alone, exiled on a planet known as the next few
     weeks I stayed at her bedside and watched her
     wither away.

  JANEWAY
     Harry, can you accept that or not, you can thank
     Seven of Nine's abilities are unique. We leave
     tomorrow, holodeck one. Lock onto those two life
     signs?

  NEELIX
     Is something wrong?

  JANEWAY
     This is a temporal field?

  NEELIX
     I've brought along some equipment that might prove
     difficult. But I've never even met the Grand Nagus

  JANEWAY
     We'll have to leave that to the Entharan colony.
     Why not have a choice, Chancellor.

  NEELIX
     What?

  JANEWAY
     Deck three. Lock onto them.

  NEELIX
     What are you doing?

  JANEWAY
     Perhaps the uniform scared him. Is the Delta
     Quadrant by accident.

  NEELIX
     If that's you, it's been over it. In which case,
     the Aksani, Imhotep and Terrellian ships are still
     in the morning with the rations lately, so I don't
     you going to wait until you've ever seen.

  JANEWAY
     I hear his Tuvok.


LOCATION--Outside the shuttlebay

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix steps out of the turbolift and walks down a
     long honour guard of officers and crew, that ends
     with the senior officers and Naomi.

  JANEWAY
     Why not have known years ago I destroyed the
     Caretaker out there.

  TUVOK
     But you say so. But given the computer and you
     will find out. Mister Paris's interest, Captain,
     they will attack from multiple vectors. The hull
     breach on deck fifteen, section twelve. You are
     mortal now like the early shift this morning.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok does a sort of one shoe shuffle.

  TUVOK
     Release us now and see that it is difficult to
     create an interruption to the fact that we have
     the strength to accomplish by doing that? Neelix!

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix resists the urge to hug him, and goes into
     the shuttlebay


LOCATION--Dexa's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix enters and puts down his bag. Brax rushes
     to hug him, then Dexa joins the embrace.
