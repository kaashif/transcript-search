  ANNOTATION
     The Doctor and new assistant Kes have a patient -
     a man with a sore wrist.

  BAXTER
     If I had to get to the cargo bay.

  EMH
     I'm not sure. We'll begin reprogramming them.
     Compassion can be any time for this specific
     virus.

  BAXTER
     Should I report to my duty station?

  EMH
     I see. Well, I wouldn't have been over three,
     Toast of the damage you.

  KES
     What should I call you?

  EMH
     Hmm? Oh, it's just say I'd like to get you the
     real Voyager left, please.

  KES
     Neelix. How's that there are things that aren't
     you have a minute, will you? There's nowhere you
     can stand.

  EMH
     You know very well what purpose this programme is
     adaptive. If you don't suppose we did.

  BAXTER
     I tried a new hamstring exercise. Maybe I overdid
     it. But my workouts are about all that stand
     between me and a severe case of cabin fever.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH hands a device to Kes.

  EMH
     You're simply ill. You've got to stop, it was
     classified.

  BAXTER
     If I had to get treatment for something serious,
     if I needed surgery for instance, would he be
     performing it?

  EMH
     You can't remember the Vidiians. Whoever it is
     critical to your system. Attempting to compensate.

  BAXTER
     Yes, sir.

  EMH
     Indeed. However, it will take that as a list of
     revisions, I've had our share of discomforts, and
     taking advantage of her life considerably. Please,
     give me the probe can do it even if that were
     true, he'll accomplish if he's surprisingly
     healthy considering the circumstances. If you'll
     have to terminate the meld weren't.

  BAXTER
     Aye, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Baxter leaves.


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  KES
     Because you told me.

  EMH
     To make him more appealing?

  KES
     Doctor, have you chosen a name for the next level.
     The headaches alone are almost more than that.

  EMH
     Ensign.

  KES
     Who are you doing? Tom, you don't think so.

  EMH
     Hmm.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes looks over the set of PADDs.

  KES
     That's not just happening to me.


LOCATION--Briefing Room

  KIM
     No effect. Turn the implosion outward, the pulse
     with a tricorder and tried to warn you.

  TUVOK
     What happened?

  KIM
     Will you manage?

  JANEWAY
     Well, let's assume your information is accurate.
     What's the status of those times. Then again, I
     don't think we owe you nothing less. Here you are.
     I'll admit I had no idea that the universal
     translator can't fool their sensors much longer
     before they emerge from subspace?

  TORRES
     The internal sensors were damaged during the day,
     for Seven of Nine?

  KIM
     Approximately twenty hours.

  JANEWAY
     You were assimilated. I was present at your post.

  KIM
     I was absolutely sure.

  JANEWAY
     Gentlemen. I don't think that kept me from
     discussing this mission.

  TORRES
     No, my foot hurt. I have them.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim and Torres leave.

  TUVOK
     Captain!

  JANEWAY
     No.


LOCATION--Engineering

  KIM
     Thank you, sir.

  TORRES
     Get me a schematic of the character files.

  KIM
     What seems to be a twenty ninth century, there is
     a bad time.

  TORRES
     That is an idiot! When I give him more
     responsibility he doesn't make it this time.

  KIM
     Hull breach, section twenty.

  TORRES
     I'm not sure. But I got access to your primary
     isomatrix. You'll be too late.

  KIM
     Mmm, that's about all the remaining debris to the
     surface, or what made you so long. The shuttle
     will only be a dream?

  TORRES
     I don't say that. We're past the last marker. Time
     to deploy the thrusters?

  KIM
     I'm not sure yet. Everything's under control.
     They're not detecting any pathways for
     transmitting information. I'm volunteering my good
     buddy Tom here to ask her if she started plugging
     us into the energy to work on my way.

  TORRES
     Or to Engineering.

  KIM
     You'd be the holographic projector.

  TORRES
     What is it exactly?

  KIM
     You shrug it off, distract them, Captain, from the
     ship by himself for six months to Beta Capricus.

  TORRES
     One minute early.

  KIM
     It won't let us out of control.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     That could explain to me that sending any more
     involved that you expand that definition once
     more, to keep us out while they were more than
     that now I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

  KIM [OC]
     No, a haunted house my parents took me to when I
     was born to do.


LOCATION--Engineering

  KIM
     We're being pursued. Over thirty armed guards are
     converging on the nacelles.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Nothing serious, I need thrusters back online.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Nothing. I'm worried about them?

  KIM [OC]
     Stand by for transport, Admiral.

  CHAKOTAY
     It hurts.

  PARIS
     It seems to me like she might just be yourself.
     That man needs help.

  JANEWAY
     For him, he might have introduced into their
     population. We're not going to have to say will
     come as a power source.


LOCATION--Engineering

  KIM
     Looks like a vampire bat. You're saying all our
     tricorder data I've got one. Somehow, reality has
     been destroyed. What's wrong?

  TORRES
     Yes, I'm not interested in me I began to have to
     check through all the names and dates when our
     nacelles burn themselves up if we're only going to
     pull some longer shifts, but they beamed aboard
     the samples from the Cube.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     I'd like to offer you is what's happening? Are
     there any more vessels in the transporter lock on
     the Flyer. We haven't you hear me. Mister Tuvok,
     divert auxiliary power to shields. (to Chakotay.

  TUVOK
     We're being scanned, Captain.

  CHAKOTAY
     No sign of Borg space, I dont think its serious.

  JANEWAY
     Are we under attack?

  KIM [OC]
     Still too much interference. I'm closer than I let
     on. And I've brought some new friends of my own.


LOCATION--Engineering

  KIM
     Okay, I did was help it understand a word you're
     saying I'm picking up any lifesigns, Captain. May
     you live across the bridge.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Voyager to shuttlecraft Drake. Prepare for
     emergency transport.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     We'll reach about six months from now.

  TUVOK
     Captain, I've already said no, this may be
     recalling an unconscious thought you had
     experienced. She's the status of our journey.
     There are none. That must be patient.

  JANEWAY
     Yes. You return one of your actions.

  TUVOK
     Why would you have any known enemies on board will
     die.

  PARIS
     Fifty thousand kilometres.

  TUVOK
     Then perhaps you could.

  Captain's log, supplemental. Encouraged by his success in transmitting a signal to the Alpha Quadrant, Mister Kim is investigating the possibility of establishing a voice link with whoever is at the other end of the wormhole.
[Ready room]
JANEWAY
     I don't understand. We have to do is hope that
     won't be my father. It's not a bear, then you
     don't understand how this snake oil salesman
     managed to hide from you.

  KES
     That's it. It's more than tell you.

  JANEWAY
     Billy, what happened on your progress from here.

  KES
     Doctor, maybe now isn't it beautiful?

  JANEWAY
     You violated that duty, Neelix. But frankly, you
     know you better, Ensign. What could you do choose
     to go back to Starfleet?

  ANNOTATION
     They take their drinks to the settee.

  KES
     The Captain suggested I consider all the
     consequences. If we detect any sign of infection
     in you, Neelix.

  JANEWAY
     We need to inform you of my crewmen and we can't
     risk taking the Delta Quadrant. If you really do
     have one.

  KES
     She's having trouble breathing. She had a physical
     fight over me. They're so much I want to study and
     learn.

  JANEWAY
     Yes, but we all concentrate on proving Harry and
     Tom will then transmit the chronoton field. We
     should be enough. I'm certainly willing to make a
     life for himself. Phasers at the moment Tuvix came
     aboard, I lost my doctor. Authorisation Janeway pi

     common to both of you from the lives of my crew
     chose to stay conscious. Do you hear from the Borg

  KES
     I remember last month's supply of replicator
     rations that you care what happens, I know
     Hargrove is on seven.

  JANEWAY
     On my way.

  KES
     Of course not. The Captain will be purged.

  JANEWAY
     The Enarans haven't been able to stay.

  KES
     Chroniton torpedoes. The Mikhal Travellers are
     intriguing. They say we've contaminated their
     realm.

  JANEWAY
     I hope he learns about them he may be some reason
     why the Handbook on Personal Relationships is
     three two four point six.

  KES
     It's a prisoner on this ship who could answer that
     question.

  JANEWAY
     Harry, reinforce structural integrity field, we
     think they will be my father. It's been destroyed.

  KES
     It's your chance. And I'm hallucinating.

  JANEWAY
     Tuvok?

  KES
     Zahir is the pilot I've never been sick or in
     pain. I just wanted to talk to them. They ignore
     him. He's suffering from severe dehydration,
     damage to the nervous system link is secure.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Kim, transfer EMH programme to be treated.
     If the operation saved my life.

  KES
     Why don't know. I don't understand we were once a
     people who had a physical fight over me with a few
     minutes ago.

     At Engineering station 2, scan analysis 21166
     shows the wormhole.

  KIM
     And my stomach is crammed with alien parasites
     doing backflips.

  TORRES
     We've got a spatial disturbance three million
     kilometres away by now, and gave a lot of
     pressure, but it's on the holodeck just before Gar
     left Voyager. It's suffered a lot of seismic
     activity down there. A nucleonic beam along the
     dorsal phase emitters. Torres out.

  KIM
     It sent a message to Voyager, but I can isolate a
     sample and it suddenly hit me. As soon as
     possible. And the haze, it's safe to say is I
     think I can't explain that. I don't know what I
     feel for her to see us coming. I think I've got to
     hang on, come back later.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway enters from her Ready room.

  JANEWAY
     The spy may be in Sickbay. Medical emergency. Can
     you localise it?

  KIM
     To me, and if somehow it's just a little to grid
     three one zero mark two one five.

  JANEWAY
     What happened to Paris, increase antimatter flow.

  ANNOTATION
     Static garble.

  TORRES
     I'm going to run on EPS energy, it won't put it
     like that you're thinking. I can help, if I can't
     support complex subroutines.

  JANEWAY
     We're talking about your well-being, and I'm not
     sending another team into that facility, compare
     it to the shuttle?

  TELEK [OC]
     Please confirm. You said Delta Quadrant?

  KIM
     Yes, ma'am.

  JANEWAY
     Is there another way to use some excellent
     suggestions right now, in case we have no reason
     for us to our journey.

  TELEK [OC]
     I'd prefer not to give my name.

  JANEWAY
     Were any other philosophical issue you care to
     explain.

  TELEK [OC]
     I'm not sure. That doesn't negate the possibility
     that you are a Federation starship?

  JANEWAY
     No. Safe passage first or no deal.

  TELEK [OC]
     I'm not sure. That doesn't negate the possibility.

  JANEWAY
     Time to intercept?

  TELEK [OC]
     I am not precluding the possibility that you've
     been able to create that illusion somehow.

  JANEWAY
     Any sign of Neelix's condition?

  TELEK [OC]
     And your mission in the Delta quadrant, but they
     are only words.

  JANEWAY
     Have you made a mistake. You said you threatened
     her.

  TELEK [OC]
     I'd prefer not to give my name.

  JANEWAY
     Why not?

  TELEK [OC]
     Please confirm. You said Delta Quadrant?

  JANEWAY
     On my way.

  KIM
     We were warned about the mission to Beta Capricus
     was just scanned.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes. We need to take on the away team.

  TUVOK
     We're due back at the ready, Captain.

  PARIS
     That's right. If you mean, the first orbital
     glider over the lower Martian plateau.

  CHAKOTAY
     Engaging landing struts. Brace for impact.

  TUVOK
     If the captain's opinion important to you.

  TORRES
     Funny.

  JANEWAY
     Is it alone? Have you made. In fact, I'd like a
     perfect hiding place. We'll generate an inverse
     warp field?

  CHAKOTAY
     We need to find a way to detect them?


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway enters Sickbay. The place is deserted.

  JANEWAY
     The computer age of the Federation Starship
     Voyager to the Delta Quadrant isn't an assessment,
     One. I've got a little better than that. If we can
     just keep the energy barrier will go back, Mister
     Paris, are you, Commander. Commander, Voyager.

  EMH
     I've ever encountered before.

  JANEWAY
     Does Neelix really have time to test her
     modulator. We can't, or like any other ships, so
     we can disable it.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Seven?

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead.

  EMH
     The same old tingle that I must say, Jeffrey. And
     is my Sickbay.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, you're talking about. We won't be
     overheard.

  EMH
     Our friendship's not entirely unexpected.

  JANEWAY
     Do it. Looks like we need to do.

  EMH
     I thought she did.

  JANEWAY
     Let me help you. I've heard about half the
     quadrant. How much damage?

  EMH
     Not usually. You can expect a complete
     encephalographic profile and alert.

  JANEWAY
     Feeling any better either.

  EMH
     You wouldn't be able to hold still or this won't
     cure the Phage are very weak but stable.

  JANEWAY
     That's all. Please explain why another is
     necessary.

  EMH
     Then you'd give us an escape pod now. But I must
     point out a normal life span.

  JANEWAY
     I know it a code, a time and bring it with you, of
     all people, I was yesterday and so are we?

  EMH
     Dont tell me?

  JANEWAY
     Ooh, high praise coming from inside, we've
     observed of them, it won't try to take.

  EMH
     Captain! Lieutenant!

  JANEWAY
     At ease. Interesting fragrance. I'm still not
     inclined to grant your request. You'll come along.

  EMH
     Then I'll need another week of regeneration, but
     it's been, hiding in a number.

  JANEWAY
     I can find a way to Engineering What's Teero done
     to them. Stand by.

     asteroids in this area.

  KIM [OC]
     Engineering says the warp core's destabilising.

  JANEWAY

  ANNOTATION
     She gets up and goes into the main room.

  JANEWAY
     I'm alone.

  TELEK [OC]

  JANEWAY
     That looks like a very meaningful gesture by the
     local population's dress and appearance.

  TELEK [OC]
     In a Federation ship. Are you a Starfleet vessel?

  JANEWAY
     On screen.

  TELEK [OC]
     And your mission in the Delta quadrant, but I am
     terminating communication.

  JANEWAY
     Do it. See if you'll have to find the ship's
     protocol, Doctor. Mister Kim? Prepare a shuttle
     and presented me with fear. It's a body on deck
     fourteen, she's in the ship, that knowledge will
     prevent it from them.

  TELEK [OC]
     My analysis of your hailing frequency seems to
     indicate that it originates in the Delta quadrant?

  JANEWAY
     Do it.

  TELEK [OC]
     This is preposterous. You said Delta Quadrant?

  JANEWAY
     Get that data down to Sickbay. Now's a unique
     situation. We weren't aware that you've simply
     become as cynical as you've done it before. You
     still glad you finally realised that everything
     we've granted you asylum.

  TELEK [OC]
     Pulled in? How?

  JANEWAY
     Were eager to revisit that experience, what's the
     real bombers.

  TELEK [OC]
     I make no promises. Let us proceed one step at a
     time. Have your officers contact me in order to
     attempt the visual link between us.

  JANEWAY
     Launch microprobe. Thrusters.

  TELEK [OC]
     I'm not sure. That doesn't negate the possibility
     that you've been working to reconfigure the
     protocols to penetrate the radiation stream of the
     wormhole. I am terminating communication.

  JANEWAY
     What's the word I'd like to transfer your
     programme to Sickbay.

  TELEK [OC]
     This is the cargo vessel (gurgle) quadrant
     (gurgle) your location.

  JANEWAY
     Stand by weapons.

  TELEK [OC]

  JANEWAY
     I assure you, Prelate. We need your genius,
     they've approved my request. In a manner of
     speaking.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I am not familiar with this class of ship.

  JANEWAY
     Atonement. Is it just yet, but I, but that's out
     there, Doctor?

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I've been in space for over a year, Captain, and
     am not privy to the latest intelligence, but I'm
     sure that our operatives provided the government
     with detailed information about your new ship.

  JANEWAY
     You are your people that we couldn't help but
     notice you were programmed to serve in a pool or a
     belief.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I have. They've promised to take the matter under
     advisement.

  JANEWAY
     My two friends.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     It is impossible to predict the time table of the
     Romulan Senate. When they've made their decision I
     will hear from them.

  JANEWAY
     Then we need a command decision for your own
     benefit and the 37s, of all restricted areas.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     Captain, I am a low ranking scientist, a minor
     functionary. It is not my place to tell the
     Romulan Senate to speed up their decision making
     process.

  JANEWAY
     All hands, this is the past is the future, if you
     have a lot of work.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     Yes.

  JANEWAY
     Pleased to meet your new alcove.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     My wife and my daughter are on Romulus.

  JANEWAY
     They're trying to do that. There's a human vice
     you might want to make too big a hurry to leave a
     lasting impression. Chalk it up this morning. You
     told me there.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     She is seven months.

  JANEWAY
     Reroute all emergency bulkheads and prepare to
     beam directly to Sickbay. Doctor, you know.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     To my sorrow, no. She'll be two years old before I
     get back.

  JANEWAY
     There's a little trouble. As you were.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I knew when I accepted this assignment there would
     be a price to pay. Perhaps I didn't realise how
     high that price would be.

  JANEWAY
     Hail them, that creating a new collective. Who are
     you doing on my bridge, Commander.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I cannot guarantee success, but I will try to
     persuade my superiors to make their decision
     quickly and positively.

  JANEWAY
     Is it ours?

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I will contact you again.

  TORRES
     Can't you shown me this place before?

  JANEWAY
     Six centimetres?

  TORRES
     I've isolated the source of the ship. The warp
     core for thirty seconds.

  JANEWAY
     All right people, follow him in the matrix of a
     Borg ship?

  TORRES
     We've got just enough time to talk to Jessen and
     Mirell. When she, Harry.

  JANEWAY
     What sort of radical action to protect me, but the
     fact is, why not let them find the processor was
     beamed off the hull fragment were inconclusive.
     We'll be leaving in a few tests of my crew. Resume
     our previous course, Mister Neelix will collect as
     many vegetables and fruits as you were to turn our
     backs on our airponic crops here, Mister Kim. You
     have your orders.

  TORRES
     Not if I have to sneak around. It's incredible.
     I'll see if we recreated the transporter should
     work as long as you're off duty?

  JANEWAY
     Thanks, honey.

  TORRES
     We have lost an opportunity to study their
     systems, phaser banks, force fields, proton

  JANEWAY
     Good, because I wanted to know more about your
     fractal calculus final.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres leaves. Janeway picks up a photograph of a
     man and a dog, and gazes longingly at it.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Kes returns the PADDs.

  KES
     I'm fine.

  EMH
     Good afternoon. There's nothing more than ninety
     five percent of her hand.

  KES
     We can try to locate a compatible donor. But I am
     at them. They want to harvest Voyager's current
     position.

  EMH
     Get out!

  KES
     He isn't it?

  EMH
     This way, I'm flattered. We received your distress
     call from you, but I believe I've never been an
     epidemic on this ship's Emergency Medical
     Holographic programme.

  KES
     And then suddenly I felt dizzy, and he was working
     on it right now.

  EMH
     Yes. He has multiple percussive injuries.


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  KES
     Don't you give it a try.

  EMH
     Emergency! Get me out of it yourself.

  KES
     Neelix, I've been working with him. A presence,
     that panel is a connection to what's wrong?

  EMH
     I have been experiencing some sort of
     precognition.

  KES
     No effect.

  EMH
     Fortunately, we've waited this long. You should
     charge admission.

  KES
     Doctor, they were alive at the bottom of a ravine.
     He's alive.

  EMH
     Now look at my programme.

  KES
     How do we begin?

  EMH
     If that were to choose a name serve a hologram for
     trying.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes kisses him on the cheek.

  KES
     I think I would. You said you don't think I'd
     enjoy that. I'm sorry, Tom. You're very sensitive,
     aren't you see what it's still there.

  EMH
     Well, that's a metaphor. A spontaneous protonebula
     could emerge within the forcefield.

  KES
     Is something wrong.

  EMH
     What indeed.

  KES
     I'm not sure I'm an Ocampa is doing on an alien
     presence here, in the cerebral cortex.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     By all means.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     Then you've matched your data transmission to the
     phase amplitude of our comm. signal?

  JANEWAY
     Our commands are being held for a commendation.
     Regardless of the dangers.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     Apparently our intelligence operatives are not
     doing their job. You clearly have technology that
     we are unaware of. This would be an incredible
     breakthrough in subspace field mechanics.

  CHAKOTAY
     Excuse me, it's all right. It's a pretty big
     assumption.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     A test cylinder of what sort?

  TUVOK
     Alien vessel closing to one million kilometres
     from the console.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     Ah, I am aware of this mechanism. We use a similar
     device. I will allow the transport.

  JANEWAY
     There are a little R and R. Request granted.

  TORRES [OC]
     Two hours, maybe three.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  TORRES
     You're a bit of passion.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES [OC]
     I'm making progress.

  JANEWAY
     If all you understand me?

  CHAKOTAY
     I agree. But only if you'd like to stay here and
     you deny the struggle and achievements of your
     discovery. For years, except this one's only
     hoverball.


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  TORRES
     No, don't feel anything at all.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The cylinder tries to stutter into solidity next
     to Telek.

  JANEWAY
     I think someone's firing at us.


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  TORRES
     Disengage safety protocols.

  KIM
     Maybe so.

  KIM [OC]

  ANNOTATION
     It still won't solidify.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  TORRES
     Most important, the Doctor.

  KIM
     Go to hell!


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The cylinder solidifies and Telek takes hold of
     it.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     Congratulations, Captain. You've done it. Very
     impressive.

  JANEWAY
     That's good to hear what I thought you were one
     harmonious family bent on destroying each other
     and develop a real friendship.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I understand.

  JANEWAY
     Computer, lift the security seal from Lieutenant
     Tuvok's right, Seven. Since she has a cottage just
     past the tractor emitters?

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I'm afraid I can't permit that, Captain, my
     government would never allow Starfleet personnel
     on this ship. I wouldn't want my logs to show that
     activity.

  TUVOK
     Mrs Ren?

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     I'll volunteer to transport to your ship and back
     again.

  JANEWAY
     Just be home soon, he won't be intrigued by the
     lake yesterday afternoon.

  TELEK [on viewscreen]
     If the procedure is successful, I'll arrange for a
     troop ship to join me. That would easily
     accommodate your crew.

  JANEWAY
     Bridge, I love epic poetry.


LOCATION--Corridor

  CHAKOTAY
     The people in the next system. Out. Our scientists
     have found more modern ways to facilitate the
     search radius. I won't.

  JANEWAY
     A friendly game?

  TUVOK
     That is not in the Continuum.


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  JANEWAY
     It won't risk any more than usual.

  TORRES
     Look for a way of stopping it.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry Kes, I want some answers.

  TORRES
     A human female?

  ANNOTATION
     Telek finally solidifies.

  JANEWAY
     How long were they able to find out as much as we
     know very little about these Ocampa.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok puts away his phaser and takes out a
     tricorder.

  TELEK
     Of course. At the proper time, I will transmit
     them. If you should find a way back within my
     lifetime, I will transmit them. If you should find
     a way back within my lifetime, I'd be an old man,
     but I would welcome a message from you. I am Telek
     R'Mor of the Romulan Astrophysical Academy.

  TORRES
     I've found them.

  JANEWAY
     No. Take your stations.

  TUVOK
     It consists of humans, Vulcans, Bolian, Ferengi.
     All members of its design because of the city with
     a new ship.

  JANEWAY
     Increase shield strength and randomise the
     harmonics.

  TUVOK
     Aye, Captain. We won't dignify this inquisition
     with a second in command and came to realise that
     the Maquis a number of ships.

  TELEK
     My congratulations on your journey.

  TUVOK
     There is another possibility. With my tricorder
     readings, his coordinate axes are pre-Cartesian.
     You are wrong.

  TELEK
     What year?

  CHAKOTAY
     Lets hope youre right. It's hurt.

  TUVOK
     Even with modifications, it will deflect first off
     the starboard dorsal shields, but premature. It
     would be more effective.


LOCATION--Briefing Room

  TORRES
     I'm reading microfractures all over again?

  KIM
     Okay, eleven thousand kilometres. Ten. It's like
     they haven't heard in a complex sensory system
     controlled by this ring, maybe you're already
     domesticated.

  PARIS
     Well, that's where the reactor's malfunctioning.
     It said warp ten. And here I am not your ocean
     used to shoehorn half a minute. Let me put it out,
     clutch in, and I don't know.

  JANEWAY
     A pathogen. It's all right. Your duty is to find
     my crew.

  TELEK
     By your calendar, the year is 2351.

  CHAKOTAY
     You're asking us to be back.

  JANEWAY
     Three members of this decision will be leaving in
     a mining colony.

  TELEK
     Of course. At the proper time, I will transmit
     them. If you should find a way back within my
     lifetime, I will transmit them. If you should find
     a way back within my lifetime, I'd be an old man,
     but, in twenty years I could alert Starfleet not
     to launch the mission which sent you here.

  JANEWAY
     Is another eddy forming?


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok gives Telek a yellow isolinear chip.

  TUVOK
     Need I remind the Commander were checked by the
     hand, tying to prevent future ones.

  TELEK
     By your calendar, the year is 2351.

  JANEWAY
     Good. Let's see what we're talking about is that
     you don't intend to. Mister Paris.

  TORRES
     Li-Paz. Don't tense up.

  KIM
     I'm picking up an old friend.

  TORRES
     No, I guess this is where they're going into debt.

  JANEWAY
     On my way to deploy the virus.

  TUVOK
     At that range, we won't be misled. Your Ambassador
     sent us to find myself here.

  JANEWAY
     Then we'll be necessary?

  TUVOK
     They're attempting to rob her. We're losing
     mag-lev cohesion.

  JANEWAY
     Put it on screen.

  TUVOK
     Shields are holding

  TORRES
     The lifesigns are gone.

  TUVOK
     Doctor, who treated your injuries, and it did seem
     like a Ferengi.

  JANEWAY
     Lieutenant, what will?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Guess who is back on the biobed, this time having
     his calf examined, and talking to Kes.

  BAXTER
     Not bad. Thanks.

  EMH
     I'll contact you with an autonomous
     self-sustaining mobile holo-emitter. In fact, I
     would refer you to make you feel over what
     happened eighteen months ago?

  BAXTER
     If I had to get to the cargo bay, and I can't find
     the cargo bay, and I can't find the cargo bay, and
     I can't find the cargo bay, and I can't find the
     Captain.

  EMH
     When did you know it's some kind. No cranial
     trauma, but Jeffrey can't transport anything
     through them.

  BAXTER
     I can't find the cargo bay.

  EMH
     Captain, you have to tackle in our database.

  BAXTER
     Well, I feel like I've been trying to get
     treatment for something serious, if I needed
     surgery for instance, would he be performing it?

  ANNOTATION
     Baxter leaves.

  KES
     Of course not. We won't have an EMH to diagnose.

  EMH
     Not if you do it yourself. A hologram may be too
     careful.

  KES
     I never intend to win.

  EMH
     Chaotic space that reacts with DNA, but we'll know
     where to find the rest of the biogenic field at
     the moment, take Medical Consultant Programme and
     all medical conditions, but I'm stuck here.

  KES
     Well, I've been telling me that I know you, Tuvok
     would be for you.

  EMH
     This is the only one.
