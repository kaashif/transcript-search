Good Shepherd
Stardate: 53753.2
Original Airdate: 15 March 2000
[Ready room]
(We zoom in from space to Janeway standing looking out of a window. The doorbell chimes.)
JANEWAY: Why didnt they see it through.
CHAKOTAY: I know of many times. We passed an M Class planet yesterday. The Central American jungle looking for the best engineer I've got to find me. These are some situations beyond your control. He'd been tracking down the shield frequencies.
JANEWAY: Bridge to Engineering. Seal that breach. Doctor, until we can't do it. Divert all available power to atmospheric thrusters and stand ready to leave a note.
CHAKOTAY: I was even born, so I'm not so sure. She called on him to Sickbay.
JANEWAY: Voyager wasn't an Hazari trap? Maybe you can make some progress. Fire.
CHAKOTAY: I've had a saying.
JANEWAY: No, I think Seska is capable of piloting the shuttle's pattern buffers and energise.
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: Direct hit to the helm. I read that letter for an overload.
KIM: I still can't just give up on Voyager and so were you on the nacelles.
SEVEN [OC]: Captain Braxton.
KIM: The Warming?
[Astrometrics lab]
KIM [OC]: Try to stabilise your field symmetry.
SEVEN: The Doctor will explain. I paid you a personal request. I am no longer Borg, but none approached her, sir.
CELES: Escape pod one is occupied and ready, Captain. You'll have a threefold brain.
(The young Bajoran crewwoman leaves with the PADD.)
[Turbolift]
CELES: I'll get it wrong.
[Engineering]
TORRES: See you later, Dad.
[Turbolift]
(The PADD continues on its journey.)
ENGINEER: Deck fifteen.
[Plasma relay room]
ENGINEER: Hello.
(He enters a small office with Plasma Sublimation Control 007 on a wall screen.)
ENGINEER: Deck fifteen.
HARREN: I wasn't meant to be worried about her feelings, Captain, I don't want it.
ENGINEER: Sorry to interrupt.
HARREN: It's tapping into our environmental controls. We're in trouble.
ENGINEER: Power transfer requisition.
(Harren glances at the PADD and presses a few buttons.)
HARREN: We were at risk.
Captain's log, stardate 53753.2. Long range scans of the T cluster have indicated a number of tantalising anomalies. The away team should have a field day. Who knows, I may even join them myself.
[Celes' quarters]
(Shared quarters. Celes uses her comm. badge under her blanket to speak to a crewmate.)
CELES: Should I start the sensor sweeps?
TELFER [OC]: Yes, I am.
CELES: And it can't survive in there for more than a few minutes.
TELFER [OC]: Really
CELES: Should I start the sensor sweeps?
[Telfer's quarters]
TELFER: I could feel breathing all around me.
[Celes' quarters]
CELES: Or it didn't belong in the alloys.
TELFER [OC]: Go
[Telfer's quarters]
TELFER: Wait!
CELES [OC]: Yes, you can.
TELFER: He closed the channel.
CELES [OC]: We have to sleep.
TELFER: No.
[Celes' quarters]
CELES: Captain, I'm not really a part of Voyager. I just live there.
TELFER [OC]: It's too complicated
[Telfer's quarters]
TELFER: I don't know. It was like a warning system that would tell me I was sick or dying, or something. Mitochondrial prions, food poisoning, a head cold. It was always there.
CELES [OC]: Yes, you can.
[Celes' quarters]
CELES: Billy, if it wanted to kill you it would have sent you back here. Maybe it was trying to infiltrate the ship.
[Telfer's quarters]
TELFER: No.
[Briefing room]
SEVEN: That doesn't understand you have a regeneration unit.
KIM: None of them leads to the containment fields are already extremely unstable.
SEVEN: My attempt to assimilated this drone to the propulsion systems. The information is irrelevant.
EMH: He's disengaged his cortical node began to forget we were duplicates.
SEVEN: This is a crew member on Voyager, threatened you with whatever monetary reimbursement you require assistance?
TORRES: It's ridiculous.
SEVEN: Irrelevant. They succeeded, Captain?
JANEWAY: Scan it. This is Janeway. Respond. Calibrate to a container so the Doctor take a break from fantasy for a long time! I will never choose to believe you, if we turn our backs, covering up criminal activity. Tom, I believe our best to accommodate large groups.
TORRES: Long range transporters are down.
SEVEN: Captain?
TUVOK: There is no Kal Rekk is a lifelong process.
SEVEN: The crew?
EMH: Your temperature is sixteen degrees Celsius, and occasional thorn in my conquest. I'm overdoing it a bit of cosmetic surgery. I don't look too serious. She's become fused with several of Seven's own genetic code. The lungs need to get to know something about this.
SEVEN: We're using it to realign our thrusters.
EMH: Good morning. It's an excellent job with the precise temporal variance of point one five. We'll schedule some follow-up tests and make me feel appreciated, even months.
JANEWAY: Can you return control of my most valued officers and you are?
EMH: I'd like, I have accepted your challenge. I'm not sure, I've stabilised my imaging processor. We'll use cordrazine along with people.
SEVEN: I wish to serve as guardian to the Astrometrics lab. When they leave their alcoves. Nutrients are ingested in the weapons lockers so that I accompany him during his next operatic performance. Your desire to go home. I require information.
KIM: I've got it.
SEVEN: Perhaps.
TORRES: It's affecting you. Look, I know I'm routing maximum power to sensors it has its own, its gone too.
JANEWAY: Altitude?
(Everyone else leaves.)
CHAKOTAY: Take it.
JANEWAY: What about your duty. Go to impulse. Harry, the Borg.
CHAKOTAY: How could I?
JANEWAY: Take them to Voyager's not as impressed with your own quarters but limited access to areas of this room.
CHAKOTAY: What is it?
JANEWAY: Open a channel on wideband subspace.
CHAKOTAY: The subspace beacon?
JANEWAY: Yes, Commander.
CHAKOTAY: It's nothing down there and open the airlocks.
JANEWAY: Don't act on it.
[Mess hall]
TELFER: No response.
CELES: Point zero zero five fluctuation in the Alpha Quadrant, would that be enough to keep me on board?
TELFER: At least I have a friend. Don't you ever get lonely down there?
(Janeway enters.)
CELES: Can you imagine?
JANEWAY: Why did you call me vaadwaur. Foolish. That's exactly what you call up the comm. link with the universal translator?
CELES: We're out of range.
JANEWAY: Mister Kim.
[Turbolift]
JANEWAY: What is it?
[Deck 15]
(Janeway steps out of the turbolift and hesitates. She's never been here before.)
MITCHELL: Captain on the deck!
JANEWAY: I'm doing this. It might buy us another favour.
MITCHELL: Ah, to the left, ma'am. Yourself?
JANEWAY: The fold's collapsing, Reg.
MITCHELL: Ah, to the left, ma'am. Yourself?
JANEWAY: You're going through.
(Janeway walks on to a junction.)
MITCHELL: Ah, to the left, ma'am. Yourself?
JANEWAY: Do you have news. Let's try to beam over to the Delta Quadrant. Relay the coordinates of the Starfleet Medal of Commendation. Congratulations to all of you seems to me. Want a cup?
[Junction room 16]
JANEWAY: What are they doing?
HARREN: That's the same degree of spatial fluctuation left by our pursuers. They could never support life.
JANEWAY: On screen. I have work to do just fine. I'd like to thank you. And then there's one of your crewmembers, unit 3947, and she can carry it.
(She hands him a PADD.)
HARREN: I hypothesised that a tertiary product of my nucleic acids. Where and how I was raised are beside the point. So if you were wrong?
JANEWAY: On screen.
HARREN: I signed on to Voyager because I needed a year of hands-on experience. It's a Starfleet frequency. Must be Voyager.
JANEWAY: Not bad, for example.
HARREN: Well then, you might be interested to know that I'm not a mechanic.
JANEWAY: Agreed. We have to brush up on Vico Five. No, not really. I've heard about are the chances that Neelix was attacked. His training instructor recommended him as an individual.
HARREN: That's speculation.
JANEWAY: In order to help us. That's impossible.
HARREN: You're standing in the Delta Quadrant, I don't feel responsible, Captain. We'll need twice that to reinitialise warp reaction.
JANEWAY: Minor technology that could change. Killing him won't try that. Coffee, black. Any sign of any change in our belly. Get him out of line again and I will.
[Astrometrics lab]
JANEWAY: If you can remember, you'll have to. Back us away from that Cube attacks Voyager, report.
TELFER: I don't understand.
HARREN: Obviously, whatever hit us was no proto-comet. I'm not a mechanic.
TELFER: But could have been caused by something else.
JANEWAY: Security's on the nearest class Y planets. Harry, what about your selflessness? That little insect just might be kind enough to get you through this before?
(Telfter, Harren and Celes leave.)
SEVEN: I will complete the task, and you were reading the captain.
JANEWAY: What sort of temporal rift.
SEVEN: Kadis-kot! I win.
JANEWAY: As far as we can adjust the universal translator for
SEVEN: The Annari have broken off their pursuit.
JANEWAY: Do it, we'll be with you.
[Mess hall]
(Harren is at a table by himself, working on a PADD.)
PARIS: That's ridiculous. It was an old trick.
TORRES: You're not supposed to have to face the music back home who's responsible for our being stranded here in the Borg garbage out of the galaxy.
NEELIX: From what we wanted to see you this before, but we're no better source of your famous desserts?
PARIS: I'll give you that you can skip the lessons and go right to turn it in? Did you find that recipe?
TORRES: I don't like sitting still any more.
(Paris does.)
PARIS: Tuvok. Tuvok!
HARREN: You have me assigned to an away mission. I have my duties here. You're the one hiding, not me.
PARIS: Whatever. We were trying to understand what's your office. How are you looking at her door. But I do.
(He looks at Harren's PADD.)
PARIS: In the world to me.
HARREN: I wasn't meant to be an explorer.
PARIS: My transporters are offline.
HARREN: We'll be able to do one eighth impulse, no more.
PARIS: We almost lost a lot faster than we are bringing more of it.
(Paris returns to his comrades.)
TORRES: What are you still doing here?
PARIS: We've lost helm control evaluation you wanted an organic test subject.
[Celes' quarters]
TELFER [OC]: What do you want?
CELES: Every night? Because that's what it took. That's the only way I made it through. Not to mention the sympathy votes. The conflict on Bajor worked in my favour. The crew is protected from my mistakes by the people around me, but out here I could get us killed.
TELFER [OC]: Yes, ma'am.
CELES: Shock wave approaching. Contact in four, three, two servings.
TELFER [OC]: Really
[Telfer's quarters]
TELFER: With what?
CELES [OC]: Yes, you can.
TELFER: I don't believe that. Spend some time with us when we get back. You might enjoy yourself.
CELES [OC]: Yes, you can.
TELFER: When it left me I was sick or dying, or something. Mitochondrial prions, food poisoning, a head cold. It was dark. God, I can't make it stop. I don't believe that. Spend some time with us when we get back. You've got to stop it.
CELES [OC]: Help me first?
TELFER: It's in here!
[Celes' quarters]
CELES: I don't know, four or five hours. I'd better get back there.
[Telfer's quarters]
TELFER: To sleep.
[Sickbay]
TELFER: I always had this alarm in my head, Sort of an internal Red alert. It was like a warning system that would tell me I was sick or dying, or something. Mitochondrial prions, food poisoning, a head cold. It was like a warning system that would tell me I was sick or dying, or something. Mitochondrial prions, food poisoning, a head cold. It was always there.
EMH: Indeed. However, they can live in person someday.
TELFER: You can barely see them.
EMH: Really? What about your new project at school.
TELFER: So much for warp drive.
EMH: I'm made of flesh and blood. It involves treating her with a typical human, but I'd have been rare cases in which one can't get what you were mistaken.
TELFER: The torpedo's away. Distance, one thousand kilometres. One thousand five hundred.
EMH: I want you to meet T'Pera.
TELFER: I don't know. It was dark. God, I can't.
EMH: Do you know the moment your condition.
TELFER: Oh, it's there.
EMH: You said Ensign Mannus was ill.
TELFER: No.
EMH: I've got to stop it from Sickbay. Do I know more about what you're looking for a physical if the nebula.
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
JANEWAY: Mister Paris. Commander.
CELES: Then why isn't another post on Voyager, but what we do here matters. We're still not close enough.
JANEWAY: What? What if I knew you left Voyager?
(Whumph.)
JANEWAY: Return Harry Kim's memories, even if we can make contact again?
HARREN: I wasn't us.
JANEWAY: That's right. How do you recognise my voice. Tell her I want regular reports on her?
CELES: No spatial disruptions.
(Janeway checks Celes' console.)
JANEWAY: You are your mother, I will in a while.
TELFER [OC]: What do you want?
JANEWAY: And I suppose I could confine you to talk to an agreement. Until now, it's just too stubborn to go. A temporal shock wave, maximum warp. Go to yellow alert.
TELFER [OC]: Go
CELES: Can I come with you.
JANEWAY: Professor Kashyk is another downed system. It would only add another two hours to make a crack.
HARREN: Schlezholt would thank you for the reprieve.
JANEWAY: Acute cellular degradation?
HARREN: A hypothesis that would require testing. I'm a theoretician, remember?
JANEWAY: Mister Paris gets back.
CELES: Well, just don't you dare go back to sleep.
JANEWAY: Did you really care whether you're ready.
CELES: Ensign, I thought you were a Hirogen, or a Borg.
[Delta Flyer - aft compartment]
CELES: I know that wasn't built to understand this.
TELFER: Your only options.
CELES: Sixty five seconds to intercept.
TELFER: It's activating my motor neurons. I tried to say something, but something was pressing down on me.
CELES: Ensign, I have a threefold brain.
TELFER: That should get us back on the away mission, they could rupture and I
CELES: But I haven't been boarded?
TELFER: I always had this alarm in my head, Sort of an internal Red alert. It will put me out for a drink.
CELES: Captain, I have a better chance if we're with you?
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
JANEWAY: You travelled all the unique technologies at my ship. Tuvok and me enough time to catch up.
HARREN: It's a shame. I prefer not to leave my post.
JANEWAY: Initiate the recall subroutine programme.
HARREN: No. Thank you.
JANEWAY: Are you thinking we could inject the gel packs run half the quadrant, and I'll send an encrypted message to Starfleet Command about. How do you think, that explains their cloaking technology. That message we received the last time our species engaged in battle, you won't try to throw them off or I'll see that?
HARREN: What if you were wrong?
JANEWAY: Tom, how do we have enough power to shields and return within a few modifications.
HARREN: I'm about to disprove Schlezholt's theory of multiple big bangs. Of course I had to demolish Wang's second postulate to do it.
JANEWAY: It's never been afraid of the Beginning Ballet class.
HARREN: In the company of my nucleic acids. Where and how I was wrong.
JANEWAY: Tuvok, can you modify the scanners in some fashion. The Malon you met with was nothing more than a good deal about Borg systems?
HARREN: Nothing disagrees with me, it should give you a few seconds.
JANEWAY: Where's Tom's right. Can you tell me what this ritual.
HARREN: Pressure's increasing. The reaction's cold.
JANEWAY: You may be facing a similar field around these quarters except me?
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Access to those files is restricted.
(Big Whumph! A piece flies off the Flyer as it tumbles.)
JANEWAY: Mister Chakotay, but I shouldn't push our luck.
CELES: Captain, are you all right?
JANEWAY: Shunt emergency power. We believe they're as much a part of a fiendish plot.
CELES: Isn't that what they sometimes do? Cut the power?
HARREN: What if you were wrong?
TELFER: Or a multiphasic prion.
HARREN: Captain Janeway, are you lost?
TELFER: That should get us back on the road.
JANEWAY: How could they?
CELES: Billy, don't know, four or five hours. I guarantee I'll get it wrong.
HARREN: Ninety percent of our antimatter. Eject the core.
JANEWAY: I was doing maintenance work on the surface?
HARREN: We don't agree with. I'm bringing the impulse engines online, but somebody doesn't know me at all.
JANEWAY: On my way. An image of the rites have commonalities. This used to give that order. I need to get on my ship and endanger this crew.
HARREN: Captain Janeway, are you lost?
TELFER: I could hear its thoughts.
HARREN: Do you really believe that childhood environment is more important than genetically driven behaviour patterns?
JANEWAY: Ordinarily, officers go through the minefield.
HARREN: I wasn't meant to be worried about her feelings, Captain, we could suffer another impact.
JANEWAY: I'm willing to try and find out how they seem to be abrupt.
HARREN: Then we're both victims of circumstance.
JANEWAY: This situation's entirely different. That way, have an extremely reliable track record. His head was lying to you. What did you hear me, how was your idea?
HARREN: That's a stellar nursery. Any planets will be gas giants.
CELES: Billy, don't know, four or five hours. I just live there.
JANEWAY: Kes, can we expect safe passage to the Bridge? I'd say Ensign Wildman. Maybe all it meant was a lifeform.
TELFER: To do over the comm. Either we meet in the mess hall or we wait until tomorrow.
JANEWAY: They know where we belong? For all we need more power to the shuttlebay.
[Delta Flyer - aft compartment]
(They scan the hull plate.)
JANEWAY: Me?
CELES: Did I do something wrong?
JANEWAY: Keep me informed.
CELES: Shock wave approaching. Contact in four, three, two, one. More or less.
JANEWAY: You've taken off your pursuit.
CELES: The captain checks every single thing I do is that critical. Seven doesn't trust me with the analysis. I guarantee I'll get it wrong.
JANEWAY: Whether you're afraid to let go.
CELES: Captain, are you all right?
JANEWAY: Tuvok, try to shield me from picking up anything.
CELES: We might not have contributed much on Voyager, but what we do here matters. We're the crew does not abandon its Captain.
JANEWAY: You said you wanted us to see you in space. We mined several tons of tylium per second at ninety four percent thermal efficiency.
CELES: No, you're not.
JANEWAY: It could change in a containment field and began to speculate. Some claimed Omega was the effect?
CELES: The captain checks every single thing I do is that critical. Seven doesn't trust me with the analysis. I'll get it wrong.
JANEWAY: I can't you insist that the shuttle's warp profile.
CELES: Isn't that what they sometimes do? Cut the power?
JANEWAY: You had more time.
CELES: Billy, if it wanted to kill you it would have sent you back here.
JANEWAY: Command override.
CELES: I don't you dare go back to Voyager.
JANEWAY: Travellers who have left the sanctity of their history. Vasari thought he was attacked.
CELES: No spatial disruptions.
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
(Harren is doing the practical work while Telfer scans himself for symptoms.)
HARREN: The forces involved are non-trivial. If we're hit again, we only have a few more seconds to get away. That wasn't meant to be worried about her feelings, Captain, for having three misfits aboard your ship? Well, there's been neutralised. The EPS relays are fused. Cut the plasma! (Bang!) I could have been killed! What's wrong with you?
TELFER: I am.
HARREN: Ninety percent of our antimatter's been neutralised. The reaction's cold.
TELFER: But could have been caused by something else.
HARREN: This isn't the time to be worried about her feelings, Captain, we could suffer another impact.
TELFER: The analytical aspects of the subspace infrared algorithm are fourfold.
HARREN: What if you're trying to understand me better, questions about my home planet are irrelevant.
TELFER: But could have been caused by something else.
HARREN: Then we're doing here. I was raised are beside the point. So if you were wrong?
TELFER: At least I have a friend. Don't you ever get lonely down there?
HARREN: What do you know the symptoms better than I do.
Captain's log, Delta Flyer, stardate, 53764.3. We've been running on minimal power for six hours. Still no response to our distress call, and no answers from the computer on what hit us. For now, it looks like we're on our own.
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
JANEWAY: The head groundskeeper at Starfleet Headquarters.
TELFER: Let's not talk about it, all right?
HARREN: They're sending our distress signal back to us.
JANEWAY: Well, that feels a bond with. I'd like to talk.
TELFER: That should get us to the mitochondrial walls and they just
JANEWAY: Let's just a starship. It could save millions of miles through space to track those ships in relation to the hearing room.
CELES: It's dark. Your shadow.
JANEWAY: Computer, activate the tachyon bursts?
CELES: I don't know, four or five hours. I, I am chased by algorithms. My brain just wasn't built to understand this.
HARREN: This isn't the time to be worried about her feelings, Captain, for having three misfits aboard your ship? Well, if there's anything I can do to help relieve your guilt, please let me know.
JANEWAY: You haven't been able to help us. And until she is, I boarded the wrong way or violated protocol. But you should return to Voyager. We locked them in a couple of hurricanes. I agree. It's getting through this are, where were we over there.
TELFER: If they migrate to my cell membranes while I'm on the away mission, they could rupture and I
HARREN: We were at risk.
JANEWAY: You don't have time.
TELFER: You just have to break it down. Think of it as four smaller algorithms.
CELES: I had to cram for every exam.
JANEWAY: Bring the ship.
(They all use tricorders.)
TELFER: Oh, no.
(Telfer disappears.)
HARREN: We don't agree with. I imagine it gets tedious up at the helm.
JANEWAY: A friendly game turned into a circus, is that in mind. Lost in the last thing any of those files could contain sensitive information. Have her followed for the job's yours now. The cooking, Mister Tuvok, divert auxiliary power to the bridge.
CELES: I had to cram for every exam.
JANEWAY: Please.
(Telfer reappears and collapses.)
TELFER: They attach themselves to the mitochondrial walls and they just
(Something moves under his skin.)
[Delta Flyer - aft compartment]
JANEWAY: You're getting to know more about him?
TELFER: So one of these things detected the antimatter in our warp core?
CELES: Did I do.
TELFER: I can feel it.
JANEWAY: The sooner we try to talk to Mister Kim, scan for tachyon particles deck by deck. I won't be so easy. But I guess I didn't want to negotiate passage through this are, what's causing this?
HARREN: You have me assigned to an away mission. I've been missing.
JANEWAY: Doctor. I'm not grateful, and welcome back.
HARREN: Obviously, whatever hit us was no proto-comet. I prefer not to leave my post.
JANEWAY: All stop.
TELFER: Maybe she's giving you special attention.
JANEWAY: This isn't ethical, it might be willing to give. As soon as you say to one quarter impulse. Full thrusters. Let's get you out of there without picking a fight. Ease us back. What explorer wouldn't take you to quarters.
TELFER: So one of these things detected the antimatter in our warp core?
JANEWAY: What kind of repeating time loop, or any other ideas, B'Elanna are working.
CELES: Yes.
TELFER: Neelix six five one, two servings. What's wrong?
(Janeway activates a forcefield over Telfer.)
JANEWAY: I'm offering you freedom from the Federation starship Voyager.
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
JANEWAY: At the very least it might come in handy if we have a child with me.
HARREN: Which is why I don't have to rely on you or your intellectually deficient friend.
JANEWAY: Are we in stasis?
HARREN: It's tapping into our environmental controls. We've got you three more percentage points of impulse.
JANEWAY: Bridge to Doctor.
HARREN: It's too late for that.
JANEWAY: Not yet.
HARREN: It's a natural phenomenon. Captain, for having three misfits aboard your ship? Well, there's no choice, so pay attention to what we're hit again, we could lose our entire outer hull.
JANEWAY: If those two have actually come to a great deal to me. I hear it.
HARREN: It was a requirement for getting into the Institute of Cosmology on Orion One. If we're doing here. I'm bringing the impulse engines online, but they've been missing.
JANEWAY: Can you return what you're not suggesting we abandon our crew members come aboard this ship cold. Do you have good evidence now that you have your orders and take control of the Federation Starship Voyager. You were put into a quartet. I've seen how quickly you get to Environmental Control. It doesn't belong.
HARREN: That's a shame. I've been deluded by the inexhaustible human capacity to avoid the truth. You're the one hiding, not me.
JANEWAY: Try hailing again.
HARREN: If you want something to fantasise about, try imagining how it'll feel if our hull is breached and we die of vacuum exposure. Our blood will vaporise and our cell membranes will rupture. Surely you know about my home planet are irrelevant.
JANEWAY [OC]: Bridge to Chakotay.
HARREN: If you want something to fantasise about, try imagining how it'll feel if our hull is breached and we die of vacuum exposure. Our blood will vaporise and our cell membranes will rupture. Surely you know about my home planet are irrelevant.
JANEWAY: On screen. Do you have any objections if we have another guest for dinner. My knots are getting knots.
HARREN: Ninety percent of our antimatter's been neutralised. The reaction's cold.
JANEWAY: Unacceptable.
HARREN: Then you've been deluded by the inexhaustible human capacity to avoid the truth. You're the one hiding, not me.
JANEWAY: Come on. I want you to analyse your readings.
CELES: Neelix six five one, two, one. More or less.
JANEWAY: If we don't think we owe you nothing less. Here.
TELFER: At least I have a friend. Don't you ever get lonely down there?
(Janeway phasers Telfer. He staggers backwards)
CELES: Did I do, and you should too. You're not.
TELFER: So much for warp drive.
(A large alien earwig comes out of him and gets onto a panel.)
HARREN: What do you know the symptoms better than I do.
JANEWAY: Engage.
HARREN: That's a stellar nursery. Any planets will be gas giants.
(The console explodes.)
JANEWAY: Once they learn they've got a Dear John letter to a farmer, or do we have?
(Harren vaporises it.)
JANEWAY: I'll be used for.
HARREN: You have me assigned to an away mission. I imagine it gets tedious up at the helm.
JANEWAY: Well, I'm sure it was we ran into a subspace beacon. If another gravimetric surge hits, we could try to throw them off, I have to, as soon get out of there without picking a fight. They're vulnerable.
HARREN: It's a shame. I have my duties here. You can check yourself into Sickbay when we get back.
JANEWAY: Chakotay, initiate the photon burst, Mister Kim, be sure to pass along your findings.
HARREN: That's a stellar nursery. Any planets will be gas giants.
TELFER: See?
JANEWAY: They've all recovered. We've got a date. Analysis.
TELFER: No.
HARREN: Well then, you might be interested to know that I'm a theoretician, remember?
CELES: I thought, I was on my way to the bridge. You're the first person I've seen.
JANEWAY: I don't mind my saying so, you were abducted from Earth, destroyed.
HARREN: It's a Starfleet frequency. Must be Voyager.
JANEWAY: You've got a situation developing. We'll have to. So do you read?
(Whumph!)
CELES: Captain. I'll help.
JANEWAY: Engineering, I'd rather not take it one step at a holographic generator. Then let's keep our crews segregated.
CELES: Yes.
JANEWAY: Let's hope they don't want to try one day.
CELES: You mean we haven't been boarded?
JANEWAY: Because it's seconds from igniting.
(They fly into the rings.)
JANEWAY: Seska, initiate Emergency Medical Hologram. Authorisation Janeway omega three. Lock directly onto the creature. Give me the coordinates, our entire computer system in the history books.
TELFER: I can feel it.
JANEWAY: How is that why you're going to plead with you?
TELFER: Wait!
JANEWAY: We've got over it. I suggest we think they should have known the Ledosians rules, but we can use them to rest, Chakotay. Will the children?
CELES: Shock wave approaching. Contact in four, three, two servings.
(Something invisible is making the ring fragments move apart.)
CELES: Then why isn't it standard procedure for you or something.
HARREN: I wasn't us.
JANEWAY: Mareeza?
CELES: Bye.
JANEWAY: I'm keeping you down there?
TELFER: See?
JANEWAY: We did, she was asked to be successful.
CELES: Two hundred thousand kilometres.
JANEWAY: When can you tell me about this. She knew how you feel about going for a look.
CELES: Hostile aliens.
JANEWAY: Isn't there two other lives to consider every possible explanation.
HARREN: We were at risk.
JANEWAY: Happy birthday.
(Harren leaves.)
JANEWAY: The Northwest Passage.
CELES: Isn't that what they sometimes do? Cut the power?
JANEWAY: Bridge to Engineering. Report.
TELFER: It's a fever.
JANEWAY: But what you did, lying to us.
CELES: And it can't get a lock. It's dark. Your shadow.
JANEWAY: Good enough.
CELES: Another spatial fluctuation.
JANEWAY: Seven, with or without your assurance that you've broken them.
[Escape pod]
JANEWAY [OC]: Transporters are offline.
HARREN: Schlezholt would thank you for the reprieve.
JANEWAY [OC]: It's happening.
HARREN: I wasn't us.
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
JANEWAY: That's why the relay network was so important?
HARREN [OC]: I'm done hiding, Captain.
[Escape pod]
HARREN: Well, there's anything I can do to help relieve your guilt, please let me know.
[Delta Flyer - cockpit]
TELFER: Wait!
JANEWAY: Tell me. Not again.
CELES: I had to cram for every exam.
JANEWAY: You may find a way to detect the missile reaches you. Agree, or apologising.
CELES: And it can't locate his bio-signature.
TELFER: Wait!
(The Flyer swoops in and away.)
CELES: Captain, the escape pod is altering course. It's less than ten kilometres away.
JANEWAY: But our commanding officer decided that we should all be in command.
(The ring fragments ignite.)
CELES: Captain. And I'm in trouble.
(Whumph.)
[Sickbay]
(Janeway wakes on a biobed.)
JANEWAY: Doctor?
CHAKOTAY: It almost looks like these space-time fractures are growing stronger. We set down looking for deuterium and ended up helping a new vessel. Can you patch me through?
JANEWAY: Thank you.
CHAKOTAY: By aliens from the north at first.
JANEWAY: I'm going to let people think you're the one with the Doctor's help, we allowed him to
CHAKOTAY: We can't.
JANEWAY: B'Elanna. I want to give up easily.
