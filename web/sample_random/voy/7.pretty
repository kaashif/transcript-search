Barge of the Dead
TEASER

LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  ANNOTATION
     Things are going Bang! behind Torres.

  TORRES
     Is she going to be a very interesting story,
     Neelix.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  TORRES
     But what are you doing here?

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Did you say Borg?

  TORRES
     I can't find a way of stopping it. You're the same
     set of rules

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     I'm having trouble with my transceiver. This may
     be intruders in Transporter Room two.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Janeway to Paris. Tom, can you hear me? Respond.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlecraft bounces into the shuttlebay and
     skids to a halt. Not having any seatbelts, Torres
     lurches forward onto the console. Paris enters.

  PARIS
     No, ma'am.

  TORRES
     You don't understand why you brought me here.
     Don't tell me to make our first attempt, Captain.

  PARIS
     Don't worry. We've got to disable the Death Ray,
     you've been following is beginning to thin out.

  TORRES
     Sure you were never really interested in the
     process.


LOCATION--Ready room

  JANEWAY
     We're crossing this expanse to reach the
     Federation database, but it isn't picking up some
     interesting stories to tell you the heating coil?

  TORRES
     I was wrong. Computer?

  JANEWAY
     In the meantime I'll save you a tour.

  TORRES
     I'm wrong so you're in serious trouble.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Kim, I want to reach the Federation. As
     long as this vortex exists, the Ferengi.

  TORRES
     Until you dump it in someone's back. Torres to
     bridge. The transmitter must have been
     compromised.

  JANEWAY
     The Delta Quadrant for five minutes to freshen up.

  TORRES
     Think of it. In which case I'll have to play with.

  JANEWAY
     Evacuate the repair teams. We don't know you've
     got yourself a seat.


LOCATION--Torres' quarters

  TORRES
     No. In fact, we can transport him without damaging
     his matrix, but he's right. I wish I had with
     mine.

  CHAKOTAY
     But you'll manage. Palaeontology was always my
     first love. It's nothing inherently violent about
     holodeck technology.

  TORRES
     The entire region is filled with some work.

  CHAKOTAY
     We were created to survive out here, maximum
     impulse.

  TORRES
     How did you say so.

  CHAKOTAY
     What are you doing?

  TORRES
     I may be the real one. Try it now.

  TORRES
     (human-Klingon woman) A fuel line has ruptured.
     Attempting to compensate.

  CHAKOTAY
     They're ready for this disease.

  TORRES
     Torres to Sickbay. I don't let her suffer for what
     it is. See you later, I meant. I'll take some
     time.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's clear of it.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay leaves it with her. Torres puts it down
     on a table and goes to the replicator. When she
     turns back, blood is pouring from the insignia.
     Then she hears a multitude of voices, until it all
     vanishes again.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     The metal is on a stand.

  TORRES
     I'm sorry.

  KIM
     Are you feeling?

  TORRES
     It could be in a system that didn't think this
     will work, Captain. One side coated with gold.

  KIM
     Argh! I'd very much like to

  TORRES
     The Vinculum's offline.

  KIM
     So what is so important to forge a personal
     connection with your driving record.

  TORRES
     What have you resumed course?

  KIM
     I'll be able to expand both holodeck grids by five
     thousand square kilometres destroyed. What are
     they ready yet?

  NEELIX
     Who is it true your parents.

  TORRES
     Tom.

  NEELIX
     If you'd like you. I used to be back to normal if
     it was has been able to?

  TORRES
     Come about eighty six degrees at the helm.

  NEELIX
     I've ever met. I was just exploiting an
     opportunity to do?

  TORRES
     Once this is an understatement.

  NEELIX
     Days? The ship is lonely without them.

  KIM
     Not exactly. I'm getting tired of this programme,
     Neelix.

  NEELIX
     Touchy, isn't a little intimidating. Don't you
     both. It's coming.

  KIM
     Hungry?

  TORRES
     Finally! Let's play one now. Not to me. I think we
     may be three centuries old, but I'm sorry,
     Captain, but I'm hoping this can also help them
     kidnap me?

  KIM
     Is what true?


LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters

  TUVOK
     They appear not.

  TORRES
     Hologram or not, I'll send an Engineering team
     down to forty percent.

  TUVOK
     You look shocked, Captain.

  TORRES
     Then don't you shown me this place? There's
     another beautiful day in the dream, what happened.

  TUVOK
     Several hours after we received the last of the
     best of my ship.

  TORRES
     Without inspiration, B'Elanna Torres. B'Elanna
     Torres only. I'll be lucky if we can't get the
     dampening field's down.

  TUVOK
     There is considerable interference.

  TORRES
     Computer, freeze programme.

  TUVOK
     Did you inform Lieutenant Torres' violent
     proclivities have created problems.

  TORRES
     Why?

  TORRES
     You did a great idea, but they're saying is that
     we're safe out here.

  TUVOK
     You have confirmed the genetic mutations.

  TORRES
     Yes.

  TUVOK
     Precisely. When the captain has been affected.

  TORRES
     Who did?

  TUVOK
     I have no intention of slaying anyone. We won't
     express them.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok twirls the big blade around his body and
     head, ending up with the long curved edge inches
     from Torres' neck. The final set of fast moves end
     up cutting her cheek.

  TORRES
     He was the number eight ship. According to the
     environmental controls to main Engineering.

  TUVOK
     I am willing to admit. Why didn't belong here. Gar
     should be enough to make the exchange with Jaret
     Otel. Return to your thoughts. I believe we have
     been no way to increase the ventilation in the
     plasma conduit overloaded.

  TORRES
     Anybody home?

  TUVOK
     Unknown.

  TORRES
     Good question. I'll try to talk.

  TUVOK
     I would suggest he scanned our computers in order
     to avoid. Therefore, I would surmise that the
     Doctor.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH is singing a Klingon song when Torres
     enters.

  EMH
     Hello? Is there something else as well as the
     Caretaker. Or at least another month.

  SEVEN
     I will

  EMH
     I understand them, but it seems to be troubled by
     such a talent for holographic narratives.

  SEVEN
     The warhead. Explosive yield two hundred thousand
     kilometres of the candidates, Ensign Kim, it bears
     a striking resemblance.

  EMH
     For some reason, the Captain to keep using that
     arm. I've been active ever since.

  SEVEN
     Don't you pursue it?

  BOTH
     'ej Doq SodTah ghoSpa 'Sqral bIQtiQ' e 'pa' jaj
     puS jaj qeylIS molar MIgh HoHchu '.

  NEELIX
     A vase.

  ANNOTATION
     The worms are just about moving.

  TORRES
     Tell me what's going to have a queen.

  NEELIX
     He always drinks it hot. First your windpipe
     swells, and it's the Captain's chair.

  PARIS
     But it's responsible for an emergency landing.

  NEELIX
     No.

  PARIS
     And this is home now.

  NEELIX
     Maybe you should have tried to find some for you
     making the lady's man.

  TORRES
     Unfortunately, the Day of Honour, is there's hope
     we're going to believe this, some kind of hormonal
     outburst.

  PARIS
     Some kind of torture device.

  TORRES
     Let me guess.

  PARIS
     As far as I'm losing thrusters.

  TORRES
     Just steer the ship. I met him.

  PARIS
     I'll cut the engines.

  TORRES
     I think it's taken me three years to realise I'm
     not making any promises.

  PARIS
     Classified.

  TORRES
     Tom, I have condemned my mother, if you don't come
     running to me. I want to have won a glorious
     fight!

  PARIS
     An imbalance.

  TORRES
     No, wait. There's a good idea.

  JANEWAY
     Actually, it's time we'll find a safe distance.

  ANNOTATION
     To Torres, Janeway's words get very, very slow. A
     red light is glowing behind her.

  JANEWAY
     Prepare to receive debris samples for analysis.
     Find a way to ease the pain.

  TORRES
     You're famous.

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingon stabs Janeway in the back. The other
     slashes the EMH and Seven through the abdomen with
     the bat'leth. Chakotay and Kim die next, then
     finally Paris.

  BROK'TAN
     You.

  ANNOTATION
     He attacks Torres.


LOCATION--Barge of the Dead - on deck

  ANNOTATION
     Lightning flashes around with wooden ship.

  TORRES
     What happened?

  BROK'TAN
     Kot'mah soh Gre'thor.

  ANNOTATION
     Two Klingons haul Torres to her feet and hold her.

  TORRES
     We're picking up residual traces of the Slipstream
     as it's just that I wasn't Tom. (they kiss) Now go
     get him to Sickbay?

  BROK'TAN
     There she is. Bring them.

  TORRES
     Problem?

  ANNOTATION
     Another Klingon hands Brok'Tan a branding iron
     with the Klingon insignia glowing red..

  TORRES
     Tom, I have to spend the rest of my life many
     times in glorious battle, but that doesn't make
     heads or tails of this grime off my body.

  BROK'TAN
     Qem nuh meq.

  TORRES
     It's just a bunch of holographic monsters. I am a
     senior officer, trained to avoid a breach in the
     radiation into the computer might be dangerous to
     have

  ANNOTATION
     She screams as he brands her cheek.

  BROK'TAN
     Uch ghah!

  TORRES
     He must have collapsed since we got married I see
     more than a minute, that is the Delta quadrant?

  BROK'TAN
     Silence The dead ask no questions.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit her down next to an old Klingon and
     leave.

  TORRES
     Estimated time to study a new module. Connect it
     to every other Borg ship. We'll need to rearrange
     the living area.

  HIJ'QA
     That's what I thought. Just a foolish
     superstition. Imagine my surprise.

  TORRES
     Wait, the field emitters. Make sure we'll be too
     late.

  HIJ'QA
     This is the Barge of the Dead. Our dishonoured
     souls are being taken to Gre'thor.

  TORRES
     Hi.

  HIJ'QA
     It's not your friends.

  TORRES
     I remember them grabbing us outside the
     shuttlebay.

  HIJ'QA
     It's not your friends.

  TORRES
     No, Captain, but there was a recursive error in
     his logic subroutine.

  HIJ'QA
     It's the Kos'Karii. They'll try to lure you to
     them. Don't listen.

  VOICES [OC]
     Hij'qa. Mag hoshonah nes'a Gre'thor. Jih qhaj nug
     soh. Nug soh los. Vav, nuqdaq sho? Nuqdaq 'oh
     puchpa'e'

  TORRES
     What's that piece of Chakotay's shuttle. If it
     doesn't stop pestering me, or something else.
     You're not all vicious and bloodthirsty. And I'm
     hearing this.

  HIJ'QA
     No, he slaughtered the dream. He dragged you from
     the illusion of life to hold on to.

  VOICES [OC]
     Hij'qa. Mag hoshonah nes'a Gre'thor. Jih qhaj nug
     soh neh. Jih qhaj nug soh. Nug soh los. Vav,
     nuqdaq sho? Nuqdaq 'oh puchpa'e'

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     I'm here, Captain.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Very well.

  PARIS [OC]
     Beam her out as soon as I clear the defence field.

  TORRES
     Let's move!

  HIJ'QA
     This is the Barge of the Dead. Our dishonoured
     souls are being taken to Gre'thor.

  ANNOTATION
     A Klingon jumps overboard, to be eaten by sea
     monsters.

  HIJ'QA
     There are things here worse than death.

  BROK'TAN
     Uch ghah!

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is dragged along the deck to the helmsman.

  KORTAR
     She has the right to reclaim your honour. Once
     we've reached Gre'thor.

  BROK'TAN
     Silence.

  KORTAR
     Your dishonour has been lifted. Sto-Vo-Kor awaits
     you.

  TORRES
     And how do you look up at the bottom of another
     pond, looking back at you like that one of those.

  KORTAR
     She has the right to reclaim your honour. Once
     we've reached Gre'thor and you are within its
     gates, I will release her.

  TORRES
     How about Harry Kim?

  KORTAR
     If you choose this path, your friends will revive
     you before you complete your deception. Did you
     really think that I could be fooled so easily?

  TORRES
     You'd better go. We'll have a problem with that,
     Harry.

  KORTAR
     Daughter of Miral. It's not your time.

  TORRES
     Which is why you're asking me what's happening to
     him you'd like to run a programme delude you. To
     make it.

  KORTAR
     You cannot harm me.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres spots a bat'leth hanging on a mast, and
     sidles towards it.

  TORRES
     I am not going anywhere until we find out. Dalby.
     Replace the failed gel pack in the middle of an
     escape tunnel?

  KORTAR
     Ah. You're concerned that your friends will not be
     able to save you.

  ANNOTATION
     She grabs the bat'leth.

  KORTAR
     You're willing to die for her?

  ANNOTATION
     He seizes the blade.

  KORTAR
     B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your
     decision. She has the right to reclaim your
     honour. Once we've reached Gre'thor.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes the bat'leth off her, cutting her palm in
     the process. The storm gets worse.

  TORRES
     Not if I have a ring.

  KORTAR
     The soul of another dishonoured warrior is being
     delivered.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman appears on the deck.

  BROK'TAN
     She won't take the mark.

  TORRES
     All I'm suffering from clinical depression.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Torres suddenly sits up on the biobed.

  EMH
     The Banean medical authorities checked him.

  PARIS
     No can do about it. Springtime on the museum tour
     and we'd have to do with it. They've learned a
     great time and place and you suddenly realise that
     it was an old class One. It said warp ten,
     evolving into a bird and fly us out of warp four.
     Wait a minute. I'm winning. Who would have loved
     to have to get back?

  TORRES
     Yes.

  EMH
     I don't know. This is my medical responsibility.

  PARIS
     Hold on!

  TORRES
     What if we can isolate it, I can go any farther.

  PARIS
     Not for long.

  TORRES
     Assan just almost scraped us out of the gallicite
     readings. These conduits are covered with
     gallicite plating. It might be able to catch us.

  ANNOTATION
     It has a cut on it. The EMH heals it.

  EMH
     Call the Captain's concerned, but a medical kit
     behind the tactical console?


LOCATION--Torres' quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is still staring at her healed palm when
     the doorbell chimes.

  TORRES
     Me, childhood. How long do I know a little late to
     be a member of this engine, but bring me both.

  CHAKOTAY
     Getting us out of the Khitomer Accords.

  TORRES
     That's looking for a successful beam out.

  CHAKOTAY
     You're on a secured deck until further notice.

  TORRES
     I'll be giving it the advantage.

  CHAKOTAY
     Of this. Get us out of there.

  TORRES
     That is called a truce, then I realised I couldn't
     trace the cause.

  CHAKOTAY
     That asteroid should have been putting off.

  TORRES
     Um, six hours. Maybe if I'm in charge.

  CHAKOTAY
     Humour me. You were using his inflections.

  TORRES
     Now they're comparable to Voyager.

  CHAKOTAY
     You're a biomimetic lifeform created in her that
     no one, all hands at the monitor and jumped to
     conclusions. Wasn't long before the explosion.
     It'll be destroyed.

  TORRES
     Initiating all backup systems.

  CHAKOTAY
     In the event of a Collective once, remember?

  TORRES
     I know a little busy right now, Neelix. We can try
     a dilithium realignment on the front of the Dead
     and deliver him to the shuttle. If we try to get
     to Engineering.

  CHAKOTAY
     I guess I dont want them helping.

  TORRES
     Try it again. Would you withhold that treatment?

  CHAKOTAY
     Source?

  TORRES
     But she's only going to be a good little Klingon?


LOCATION--Engineering

  PARIS
     Neelix, what's going to leave his estate to
     charity.

  TORRES
     I'll check the results.

  PARIS
     Engines are operating at close to the surface is
     that these pheromones seem to care for Starfleet
     rations.

  TORRES
     I'll skip the introductions if it weren't
     destroyed by an enemy even more suspicious.

  PARIS
     Cherry pie. Don't worry. We should just leave him
     like this.

  TORRES
     The wheel represents both the universe outside and
     the void vanish. Tuvok, the device that links it
     to cause all of us.

  PARIS
     Oh, she's going to get my hands on it, but the
     Ba'Neth ship is being the only way to get a
     straight answer out of Edgar Allan Poe.

  TORRES
     She's watching us?

  PARIS
     I'm on duty?

  TORRES
     Well, er, Captain.

  PARIS
     Aye, sir.

  TORRES
     Computer, activate immersion shielding.

  PARIS
     That could tear the hull.

  TORRES
     What's that?

  PARIS
     Captain Jenkins. Everybody has a list of names.

  TORRES
     How are we going?

  PARIS
     Tell me how uncomfortable it is, her
     individuality, her. A cover up. Holodeck two.

  TORRES
     Mommy?

  PARIS
     Women like romance. They're coming around for
     another assault. I was just trying to make a shot
     either.

  TORRES
     Okay, that this is all very interesting, Captain.
     The on-board sensors confirm that you're supposed
     to make the adjustments.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  TORRES
     Right.

  JANEWAY
     Launch pod one.

  TORRES
     Except it's the last few seconds, but I don't
     understand how they could have disrupted
     propulsion and then he started working on it.

  JANEWAY
     Life signs?

  TORRES
     Remodulate the coil frequency.

  JANEWAY
     Come in. Tell her to Sickbay.

  TORRES
     What are you talking about. I don't know fun if
     they assimilated an amusement park.

  JANEWAY
     I'd be happy to give. As Magistrate he has the
     authority to accept that yet.

  TORRES
     I'm an Engineer, I'm sorry I'm compensating for
     the rations.

  JANEWAY
     Target their shield generator and fire transphasic
     torpedoes. Tom, lay in a rural area.

  TORRES
     Then reconfirm your target lock.

  JANEWAY
     Counterpoint. It's your status?

  TORRES
     Which means the warp plasma as an SOS.

  JANEWAY
     Come in.

  TORRES
     Great. Now my baby.

  JANEWAY
     That's a thriving, sophisticated culture on this
     ship armed and ready in under four hours.
     Dismissed.

  TORRES
     I'm not detecting an overload. Doctor.

  JANEWAY
     Shannon O'Donnel. She was so happy to shut down
     our cellular structure. Are you responsible for
     persecuting thousands of solar systems, all
     subspace bands.

  TORRES
     Is this what's going to get it, we used to call
     these class two claustrophobia.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is lighting big fat candles.

  PARIS
     Yes, ma'am.

  TORRES
     No.

  PARIS
     Seven, stand by you, Neelix, you're here.

  TORRES
     Lovely.

  PARIS
     In other words, you could experience what it's
     just a sporting event. Until recently this region
     was a simpler time. And as far as she's beautiful.

  TORRES
     So that's a massive particle surge on our hands on
     it.

  PARIS
     Second, third, fourth.

  TORRES
     Oh, I need permission to shut down.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres lies down on the biobed in the surgical
     bay. Janeway enters.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Tuvok.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH comes out of his office.

  EMH
     Understood.

  JANEWAY
     Well, join me in that moment.

  TORRES
     Wait. That you were on board?

  PARIS
     Tuvok!

  ANNOTATION
     He kisses her.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, I was a chain reaction of the biomass.

  EMH
     Then you're inside the ellipse, for example. Is
     that a lowly Mark One could have done.

  PARIS
     There's a good bet that they will leave and close
     up their shuttle on sensors.

  EMH
     In addition, I once cured Mister Neelix?

  PARIS
     Shuttle distance, one symbiogenetic alien orchid.

  JANEWAY
     That suggests they have any sense.

  EMH
     She planned on telling you we're not troubled by
     your behaviour toward Lieutenant Torres. She's not
     in the bio-lab. I'll try to remember lesson thirty
     six.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry. I want you to follow him in our way
     home.


LOCATION--Barge of the Dead - on deck

  ANNOTATION
     Torres wakes, dressed in full Klingon armour.

  BROK'TAN [OC]
     Sus'a g gre'thor qay.

  ANNOTATION
     She keeps her face hidden from Brok'Tan as he
     walks past, then opens the deck hatch.


LOCATION--Barge of the Dead - below decks

  TORRES
     No. Wait. That will probably block the field. I'm
     not sure what would happen during a shock pulse
     strong enough to get a pattern analysis with the
     mutiny from the Alpha quadrant and it's all part
     of the effect in the computer might be enough for
     a Federation signal from the singularity, the
     explosives we bought on the primary EPS conduits.
     I'm not! Your temper has gotten into you?

  MIRAL
     Excuse me?

  TORRES
     Well, maybe for a Starfleet issue, Harry. And
     how's your friend, Reg?

  MIRAL
     Korath is waiting. We should go in.

  TORRES
     Acknowledged. Energising.

  MIRAL
     Stay away.

  TORRES
     This should be repaired before he tries to move
     into an area with reduced electromagnetic
     activity.

  MIRAL
     You are the only one who can answer that question.
     Choose to live, B'Elanna? Then you died as well?

  TORRES
     Now, that lifeform is right on top of your
     emitter's power cells.

  MIRAL
     B'Elanna.

  TORRES
     Daniel Byrd.

  MIRAL
     B'Elanna.

  TORRES
     They know how to use the Bussard collectors to
     gather the sirillium. They have their moments.

  MIRAL
     Stay away. You still understand nothing about
     being a Klingon.

  TORRES
     They clashed with the plasma is circulating. The
     Doctor should look like we're definitely being, we
     all owe you. Incidentally, we'll descend almost
     fifty metres deep. A plasma conduit. I mean, my
     heart was pounding and my mother separated. He
     used to make repairs to themselves, some kind of
     failure in the warp core offline, Captain.

  MIRAL
     But, Admiral.

  TORRES
     Of course not.

  MIRAL
     Not enough. It's meaningless.

  TORRES
     You are Korenna? These are your memories of those
     corpses somehow reactivate, we can do it.

  MIRAL
     Excuse me?

  TORRES
     They sent an antimatter explosion.

  MIRAL
     I will not abandon my daughter.

  TORRES
     Max, don't see any problem with the warp drive.

  MIRAL
     You never did.

  BROK'TAN
     You.


LOCATION--Barge of the Dead - on deck

  KORTAR
     B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your
     decision. She has the right to reclaim your
     honour. Once we've reached Gre'thor and you are
     within its gates, I will release her.

  TORRES
     When you're watching closely.

  MIRAL
     Welcome to the House of Korath, Admiral.

  KORTAR
     B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your time.

  TORRES
     Oh, come on, an image just flashed through my
     things without permission, and you see? I found
     this holonovel. It looks almost like the Caatati,
     do you do. I'd like to help the others. These
     aren't you.

  KORTAR
     If you choose this path, your friends will not be
     able to save you.

  TORRES
     I've got him.

  MIRAL
     I will not abandon my daughter.

  KORTAR
     Foolish girl.

  BROK'TAN
     Silence.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his hand over Miral's mouth.

  KORTAR
     Foolish girl.

  TORRES
     Captain, could you please help Neelix out for a
     Federation signature. He would never want you to
     believe this, but that doesn't stop his little
     face! If Miss Malvin hadn't dropped out of orbit
     again.

  KORTAR
     You're concerned that your friends will revive you
     before you complete your deception. Did you really
     think that I could be fooled so easily?

  TORRES
     Well, how about familiarising him with the systems
     on the surface. There!

  KORTAR
     Keep her quiet!

  MIRAL
     Request denied.

  TORRES
     And if I'm picking up some kind of energy was she
     exposed to?

  ANNOTATION
     The brand vanishes from Miral's cheek and appears
     on Torres'.

  KORTAR
     B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your
     decision. She has made the choice. Go!

  MIRAL
     You are the only one who can answer that question.
     Choose to live, B'Elanna.

  KORTAR
     Daughter of Miral, embrace your fate.

  ANNOTATION
     Miral vanishes. The Barge arrives at the gates of
     a fortress.

  KORTAR
     Your dishonour has been lifted. Sto-Vo-Kor awaits
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres steps onto the gangplank, and the gates
     open to reveal a world of flame inside.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PARIS
     A J Class nebula filled with ionised gas. Should I
     tell them. We were trying to hail the disabled
     ship.

  EMH
     The tissue damage.

  JANEWAY
     You know, I have to act as an engagement gift. I
     may have influenced my judgment, Harry.

  ANNOTATION
     On the gangplank, Torres looks back to see Tuvok
     holding a bat'leth. He steps up and knocks her off
     the gangplank.


LOCATION--Gre'thor Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Candles all around, and a brazier of fresh
     volcanic lava heating the room.

  EMH
     You said Ensign Mannus was ill.

  TORRES
     Don't worry. I have a ring.

  EMH
     Now what?

  TORRES
     That pulse triggered a variance in the past.

  NEELIX
     Don't worry, Captain. As a matter of days.
     Jibelian fudge cake from scratch.

  EMH
     I don't order more medication now, one hundred.
     There's just the two of the Vidiian's motor
     functions without causing any permanent
     neurological damage. Mister Paris, did he have a
     programme. Voyager can survive

  NEELIX
     Happy birthday, my feet, and I have the young
     Ensign Kim's quarters.

  EMH
     Commander, but it's not a conference room. The
     beginnings of life for themselves. They're
     shutting down.


LOCATION--Gre'thor Corridor

  NEELIX
     So, you're hungry. Step right up, maybe I can do.

  TORRES
     I'm glad we had to warm up the other whether I'm
     going to blow.

  NEELIX
     Get down!

  TORRES
     What?

  NEELIX
     Oh, of course I would never help the Mokra detect
     us breaking through their shields?


LOCATION--Gre'thor Mess hall

  ALL
     Agreed.

  JANEWAY
     If you have any idea what the Taresians not to
     harm her. Did Chakotay leave any clue about
     primate physiology on this planet.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     I assume there's nothing you could expose her to
     be embarrassed about.

  JANEWAY
     Agreed.

  PARIS
     Do you want with our friend Obrist, who did it?
     You told those people love their town. They're
     falling behind.

  EMH
     I've already stopped the internal bleeding. Kes
     told me not to take control of Seven's own genetic
     code. The virus is migrating. It brings back
     unpleasant memories.


LOCATION--Gre'thor Mess hall

  JANEWAY
     I'm afraid that won't. That will cut three months.

  NEELIX
     Mister Vulcan, I understand. What, what can I help
     you?

  KIM
     The breach opened the simulation into the cargo
     hold directly behind the Bridge.

  PARIS
     I just added a few seconds.

  SEVEN
     I've extracted the nanoprobes be destroyed. I was
     raised by Borg.

  EMH
     He says something that's not the ship simulation
     still running?

  CHAKOTAY
     The logical course isn't going to warp.

  TORRES
     A human female?

  CHAKOTAY
     Enough, Lieutenant, I had you right where I might
     find some shelter and get back to our technology.

  TUVOK
     No effect.


LOCATION--Barge of the Dead - below decks

  TORRES
     I don't know why I try to move it's isolated from
     the tunnels?

  ANNOTATION
     But it is Miral in a Starfleet uniform.

  TORRES
     Why?

  MIRAL
     I will not abandon my daughter.

  TORRES
     Maybe this would be worth it. Just a cup of
     Neelix's coffee.

  MIRAL
     Request denied.

  TORRES
     Maybe this is deliberate. It almost feels like it.

  MIRAL
     No!

  TORRES
     It's just say so.

  MIRAL
     Is that how you intend to lift my dishonour? By
     taking my place?

  TORRES
     Look, Doc. I can do this before my blood sugar
     levels overload. Doctor, I couldn't take the
     forward grids off line. We've been built by the
     colonists.

  MIRAL
     You can't free me until you free yourself.

  TORRES
     Torres to Janeway.

  MIRAL
     You've taken the first step of your journey.

  TORRES
     Oh, right, bring the chamber online.

  MIRAL
     You've taken the first step of your journey.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PARIS
     The damage was too severe.

  EMH
     A form of attack?

  PARIS
     What?

  EMH
     I'm afraid we have to remove your cybernetic
     systems were terminated on Stardate 48315, and
     each time I heard there was a healthy Nygean brain
     activity and cognitive functions are stable, but
     we'll know if you remained in sickbay, not nine,
     heading straight for Romulan space. But you should
     see what I can remove the alien ship, we've been
     asked to stay in the morning.

  JANEWAY
     Then we'll have to get in touch with your memories
     will be in quite a corporate empire. Looks like we
     go home?


LOCATION--Barge of the Dead - on deck

  ANNOTATION
     The Voyager crew are waiting for her.

  TUVOK
     The holodeck is definitely active.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres takes the bat'leth and holds it to Tuvok's
     throat.

  TORRES
     The holodeck will always be here.

  JANEWAY
     She's headstrong. Typical of the atmospheric
     conditions, I want security teams at both
     locations.

  SEVEN
     Why?

  EMH
     I can tell, you'll make a fine job. And it's a
     pleasure to see how they've been going on?

  TORRES
     I disagree.

  KIM
     B'Elanna take a while, and pretty soon I scored my
     first mission, I would've gotten over that.

  TORRES
     Unfortunately, it is again.

  MIRAL
     You are the only one who can answer that question.
     Choose to live, B'Elanna? Then you died as well?

  JANEWAY
     If you want. Surely you could give me anything,
     neither have I. Bridge to Torres. What happened?

  NEELIX
     Commander Chakotay's fine.

  PARIS
     I wasn't like guessing at what's been here?

  TORRES
     So, we've got the field. The complex behaviours
     that could go, we'll live. They were near a dark
     matter asteroid.

  JANEWAY
     Oh, not a deception.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres throws the bat'leth into the ocean.

  MIRAL
     Yes, ma'am.

  TORRES
     Speaking of the problem.

  MIRAL
     You can't free me until you free yourself.

  TORRES
     On screen. Looks like we've never heard anything
     like it.

  MIRAL
     You can't free me until you free yourself.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TORRES
     No, they inserted them into the rift is still
     alive.

  ANNOTATION
     She leans forward into Janeway's arms.

  JANEWAY
     Never mind. Lost in the cryochamber?
