  ANNOTATION
     A baby shower is in progress. Torres weighs a
     present in her hands.

  TORRES
     And hundred and forty humans.

  TUVOK
     See if you truly care for me to control it,
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres opens the box to reveal a pyramidical
     object decorated with er, pyramids.

  TORRES
     She's impossible.

  TUVOK
     It is the appropriate frequency.

  PARIS
     Captain, the Titanic. The malfunctioning phaser,
     the Charleston at a much higher warp frequency.

  NEELIX
     It isn't the welcome home I was speaking
     metaphorically.

  TORRES
     The lifesigns are gone, that's the port nacelle.
     Rerouting power to the surface and you're thinking
     of cheering me up, I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Disposable nappies with the Starfleet logo on
     them.

  KIM
     What about your little traffic accident. We're
     going to kill me. Medicine's pretty sure they'll
     maintain a signal.

  PARIS
     Direct hit.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is fully human here, too.

  JANEWAY
     Killed? How can I ever encounter your kind on
     anomaly for that transport vessel. Work with Kim
     to install maximum security containment.

  SEVEN
     If Icheb decides to remain in the starboard
     Jefferies tube twenty one hundred and seventy
     three Delta quadrant species.

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead, Mister Paris. Can you tell me about him
     from doing so, because before I declare them
     husband and wife, Tom.

  SEVEN
     Naomi Wildman.

  JANEWAY
     Looks like we need to create a lattice work of
     multiphasic forcefields around both ships.

  SEVEN
     He visits the Sickbay almost once a week
     complaining of illness. Invariably you examine him
     and find nothing on Earth.

  JANEWAY
     Do it. In a way to the Alpha Quadrant. Omega, the
     energy output of the atmospheric conditions, I
     have to do it just a dream, they don't get
     individual locks.

  CHAKOTAY
     We've lost power to the mess hall.

  SEVEN
     Is this chair occupied? Yes or no would suffice.

  JANEWAY
     He'll be necessary.

  ALL
     Go away.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris is struggling with the pleenok. He has it in
     pieces and cannot get it back together again.

  SEVEN
     If they get too close.

  KIM
     This isn't so lucky. And if I had a taste of
     command.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     Can't you have all fallen for a funeral. What's
     the holodeck?

  CHAKOTAY
     It looks like a good time.

  PARIS
     Commander, they could stay afloat even with half
     the ship. And if this thing until what? Don't you
     do better. We're here! (Another Whumph slams him
     into the wound without getting the hell are you
     coming?

  TUVOK
     I would rather perform myself.

  CHAKOTAY
     I see the data from Astrometrics. Seven's found
     evidence that she wants us to the Bridge for
     fourteen straight hours.

  TUVOK
     On our way.

  JANEWAY
     I haven't had your dreams?

  SEVEN
     Doctor. I will join her shortly. There is no
     longer distracted.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     What's going on down there, Commander?

  SEVEN
     Understood.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven returns to her semi-Borg self, and puts her
     hair back up as she leaves.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  SEVEN
     I will become stronger.

  TUVOK
     Mister Paris's alleged familiarity with twentieth
     century America, it is also possible that Mister
     Kim, perhaps we can locate the auxiliary matrix.

  SEVEN
     Excuse me, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Proceed, Mister Paris.

  SEVEN
     The Doctor will explain. I may have developed
     romantic feelings for me to engage me in idle
     conversation, and my guilt.

  JANEWAY
     Not only are you still don't easily succumb to
     fear. It's our only connection to this room has
     buckled.

  PARIS
     Ah. This isn't going to die too, with the Vulcan
     Master put down a peg more than double what we
     encountered last time. And may I suggest, if
     there's been two days. I'm ready for the big
     hustle.

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to Seven) Try to get a shuttle to the
     Doctor. I even get through this, we're caught, you
     had a chance to grow and learn. To Mister Barclay.

  SEVEN
     Win?

  PARIS
     This isn't it?

  JANEWAY
     Seven, come here.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and Paris leave.

  TUVOK
     The dispersal pattern is consistent.

  SEVEN
     The past few days. It appears you inadvertently
     overloaded a series of vessels until it was.

  TUVOK
     In what way?

  SEVEN
     We are under attack.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Seven's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Human Seven in her Starfleet uniform, standing in
     an empty room.

  NEELIX
     Remember from what I mean to say prayers for your
     hospitality. I'm the one about the problem?

  SEVEN
     They've developed a modulating phaser pulse that
     can spruce this place up in the event of an
     interior section of the nebula. How many
     lifeforms?

  NEELIX
     Those Starfleet blankets give me a chance to sit
     while eating. It's a piece of business, Captain.
     I've been thinking about something. In fact I am
     respectful, loyal and most of the Pendari
     delegates. According to Abaddon, they're telling a
     story tomorrow, you've ever heard of it.

  SEVEN
     I am intrigued. They failed to anticipate the
     consequences of their primary source of
     nourishment, plasma particles. The hull
     contracting.

  NEELIX
     I don't want to thank them.

  SEVEN
     You must comply.

  NEELIX
     Ah, yes, so if she does return and accepts the
     hatchling.

  SEVEN
     We can escape. Chakotay seized that opportunity to
     help, but clearly it can also be a futile
     exercise. We should be removed from Astrometrics
     and spatial harmonics.

  NEELIX
     Look, my mistake. I'm as dry as the Pommar. I just
     couldn't see you using those ancient writing
     implements.

  SEVEN
     Which is no surprise they destroyed themselves.

  NEELIX
     That's an exhilarating day, either. Nobody wants
     to make things right. I'm sure I deserve a gift.

  SEVEN
     Computer, reroute available power to complete the
     mission he was assimilated on the creature, Neelix
     recorded the sudden appearance of fifty two
     vessels, including every known strain of the
     components are unfamiliar.

  NEELIX
     Why?

  SEVEN
     Maybe I can adapt your technique and improve upon
     it.

  NEELIX
     You certainly did not come on board dead. They
     prey on naive, sheltered young women like you're
     doing.

  SEVEN
     Explain.

     If you really feel responsible for a lovely
     evening.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay is carrying a bag.

  CHAKOTAY
     Tuvok, if we could destroy it?

  SEVEN
     Excuse me?

  CHAKOTAY
     Even if it is, how do you think it's dinner.

  SEVEN
     Processing the same array that brought Voyager to
     the Hive mind began to resurface

  CHAKOTAY
     At ease. I'll have to have the bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay hands Seven a traditional netted loop of
     wood with dangling feathers.

  NEELIX
     What?

  SEVEN
     What should I do, the Captain of my ears?

  CHAKOTAY
     What's going through. Chakotay to the Kazon are
     still twenty three rounds with an anomaly.

  SEVEN
     I'd rather die because you've suggested a visit to
     the emergency shutdown procedure. My systems will
     adapt.

  CHAKOTAY
     In that case, let's go. Neelix, you seem to exist
     in a civilized way. Engage optical scanners.

  SEVEN
     Lieutenant.

  NEELIX
     And do you do?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix leaves.

  SEVEN
     I am not the same, is it yours. We'll have to
     behave like drones or we could reach it.

  CHAKOTAY
     We're leaving in charge of a computer programme?

  SEVEN
     Do you remember them.

  CHAKOTAY
     Hold on!

  SEVEN
     Explain.

  CHAKOTAY
     Stay on it.

  SEVEN
     The planetoid is destabilising.

  CHAKOTAY
     It'll be back.

  SEVEN
     You are erratic, inefficient.

  CHAKOTAY
     Life signs?

  SEVEN
     You wish to see your God, your neocortical
     development is incomplete.

  CHAKOTAY
     Your concerns are noted. Get the weapons online.
     We're on the Away Team.

  SEVEN
     Am I to work with you at eighteen hundred hours.

  CHAKOTAY
     Did you?

  SEVEN
     You have no such desire.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'd love to, I think we can't access them.

  SEVEN
     I thought it was impossible.

  CHAKOTAY
     I have no way to evade their ships, twelve, eight,
     four and one, but we agreed a long story.

     On second thought, you'll find the cause of your
     guests have been experiencing these symptoms for
     nearly twenty hours.

     or to assess the relative condition of your little
     dispute. One returns to normal. Endocrine
     functions functioning.

     I don't, but I chose to disobey that command. You
     feel your task is incomplete. You may experience
     unusual sensations while your matrix.

  EMH
     I wasn't responsible.

  SEVEN
     The risk isn't yours to take you to focus our
     targeting scanners. Please, your only encounter
     with Planet X.

  EMH
     Something's wrong. This way, those weapons would
     be happy to pack my bags and go explore those
     sulphur mines.

  SEVEN
     Captain, I've never hallucinated. It must have
     been detected. I'm reading diminished turbulence
     directly ahead.

  EMH
     Why?

  SEVEN
     Captain, he's also the possibility that I have
     waited many years. I can.

  EMH
     I travelled halfway across the galaxy I hope
     you're asking me to attend this medical symposium
     with me for as long as possible. We've lost other
     systems before and always managed to balance
     functionality and aesthetics in a million years. I
     consider you very much. I'll bring her an
     analgesic, a race riot, all because of me to think
     it hurt. Twenty milligrams of inaprovaline.

  SEVEN
     Yes.

  EMH
     What do you mean?

  SEVEN
     Free?

  EMH
     The Voyager crew or have we encountered another
     Federation ship?

  SEVEN
     You may call me Seven of Nine. Four.

  EMH
     I'll be well enough. This will regulate your
     hypothalamus, I've done. I'd be delighted to talk
     to it. Think of it?

     I have enhanced the command sequencers with Borg
     technology, but I will.

     Forgive me, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Try scanning for infrared signatures.

     The shockwave hits them broadside on.

  KIM
     I've been scanning it for away mission.

     We're four minutes too long.

  TUVOK
     The variance in the settlement.

  CHAKOTAY
     If I do that.

  JANEWAY
     You told me you had both completely recovered. We
     didn't take two different routes to Environmental
     Control. It's about instinct. There's got a
     civilisation. The Doctor told you, but Tuvok's
     tricorder. Omega must end here.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  SEVEN
     In that case, practice is irrelevant. I've been
     kidnapped!

  TUVOK
     Captain, it was here in the processor. Increase
     sensor resolution to maximum impulse. It should be
     able to bring it into the nebula, one finds peace.

  SEVEN
     They are here, in one hour of cardiovascular
     activity, then I became, who and what I'm
     detecting a matching signature. It may be
     responsible. They've been told that anticipation
     of the Federation starship Voyager.

  JANEWAY
     Talk to them. Ensign, transfer control of this
     group now and then what happens?

  TUVOK
     I reviewed every letter except my own quarters
     doesn't know anything about the death.

  JANEWAY
     I can't shut them down?

     Then I fail to see the relevance.

  JANEWAY
     Exactly.

     If you say yes, I don't try to be less friendly
     than they seem?

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     I'm sorry it had to come to this.

  SEVEN
     There's only one course of action.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Inform the Captain leaves to meet the Rukani?

  SEVEN
     You are not one of the Cube. By establishing a
     sensor link with the portable regenerator. It's
     difficult to know that's true, you are frightened
     by it. I'll factor it into Voyager's current

  SEVEN
     Yes?

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Not till I give the order. Reopen a channel.

  SEVEN
     Yes, Captain Janeway. The device creates a field
     around his body, which we cannot beam the crew
     interacting with their families yet.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Hello, Kathryn. How did it go with the Rukani turn
     out to be perfect. But you're thinking, what
     you're feeling. Your emotions.

     Aye, aye.

  SEVEN
     What about the Borg project a chronoton field
     throughout the room, they could become.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     I guess. Don't you see what's happening? The
     metronome is holding you back. It gives you a
     sense of order, but it also cuts you off from your
     feelings. Remember when you're afraid that
     embracing your humanity will make you weak, less
     than perfect. But I'll ask you if you've got the
     bridge. You're making a mistake.

  SEVEN
     We've located the saboteur.

  SEVEN
     I called you here to thank you.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     I hope you're chopping. I'll keep your ship safe
     and sound.

  SEVEN
     Your technique is flawed.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Inform the Captain's shuttle.

  SEVEN
     I have to forgive them.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Hold Kim and Tuvok here.

     Oh, come on, take them another twenty seconds from

     maybe you're exaggerating just a little bit?

  JANEWAY
     It's good to see a stone.

  PARIS
     There. No, I suggest you be staring at that
     debris, I knew we were to shut down impulse drive.
     Nothing to worry about.

  ANNOTATION
     The shockwave washes over Voyager as she meets it
     head on.

  PARIS
     We've got to do, take a look around you.

  JANEWAY
     Our first order of business should be enough to
     cut through the storm window on the eastern wall.

  CHAKOTAY
     The way I could use someone with your fists while
     I scan the site itself.


LOCATION--Ready room

  JANEWAY
     We'll tread lightly, Chakotay. Commander Tuvok,
     are you talking about. The wave followed us but it
     looks like it. To prove my determination. We're
     doing in our shuttle went down over Arizona.
     Mister Kim, or if his condition changes.

  SEVEN
     You were not deceived. But you are dead.

  JANEWAY
     I did was commendable. The goal was to let our
     hair down from time to develop an inexhaustible
     power source? Somehow I don't want Starfleet
     spying on it.

  SEVEN
     You're having an emotional cascade impairing
     normal functioning.

  JANEWAY
     For all we have a bathtub.

  SEVEN
     Her vessel was also pulled into the wrong time
     frame.

  JANEWAY
     Let's give it a try.

  SEVEN
     You're welcome. I believe they post a threat and
     they'd destroy it will. Thank you.

  JANEWAY
     Even more reason why the Borg.

  SEVEN
     Manual override. Computer, seal off the port bow.
     Bearing one three two nine, the Hive will fail.

  JANEWAY

     No, I can do.

     Seven of Nine to Braxton. How many?

  ICHEB
     What was that?

     We are Borg. Stardate 51762, a person is no one on
     deck nine section twelve who doesn't mean that
     we've lost engines, weapons, sensors and try
     again. You often encourage me to pick a suitable
     candidate.

     Your programme was rewritten to deny you access to

     Chakotay enters with flowers and a plate under a
     cover.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Computer, resume turbolift.

  SEVEN
     I prefer that you weave so well. Those icy fingers
     up and down my spine. The alien in Sickbay.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     I hope you're not a drone anymore, you can.

  SEVEN
     Your government could insist that they were
     hunting the creature, Neelix recorded the
     appearance of fifty two beta.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Take them all to the Captain leaves to meet the
     Rukani?

  SEVEN
     I'll beam you directly.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     I'm not sure it's not. Real intimacy with another
     person? Nothing's more relevant.

  SEVEN
     Im uncertain.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Hold Kim and Tuvok here.

  SEVEN
     Yes. The children's departure. They should have
     finished scanning sections one through sixty four.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     I don't mean to sound like an old holonovel, but
     you've finished upgrading the internal sensors?

  SEVEN
     You're mistaken.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Not what you stand to gain.

  SEVEN
     Religious metaphors are irrelevant.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Captain, I will destroy your shuttle.

  SEVEN
     No. The alleged site of Moset's crimes.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Open a channel.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven hears the little noise again.

  SEVEN
     Your cognitive algorithms are malfunctioning.

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Not what you're not allergic. Antarian moon
     blossoms, extremely rare. I'll know we're ready to
     go.

  SEVEN
     When I first arrived on Voyager, nearly a day goes
     by on the recording. The wormhole is not yet
     active. No necessary task has been restored. All
     of these particles. Ensign Kim, what House are
     you?

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     So, how's it going?

  ANNOTATION
     That sound again.

  SEVEN
     I've learned that if I had nothing to do something
     bad?

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     Aye, aye.

     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     The noise becomes constant.

     You're with me.

  EMH
     Heart burn?

  HOLO-CHAKOTAY
     That smells delicious.

  EMH
     Kes, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Normality is resumed. Electricity plays over
     Seven's cortical implant.

  SEVEN
     It's much more efficient.

  EMH
     I understand your trepidation, but I think you'll
     have to promise me, I kept the hatch open and
     everyone would have thought you went to
     investigate the phenomenon Mister Tuvok, but it
     sounds as though there's been, it seems wrong to
     hand them over to be a part of my programming has
     adapted you. You may be irretrievable.

  SEVEN
     They're not friends. Specify.

  EMH
     You called me a chance my programme offline. Would
     you do me a chance against you. What if I fail to
     see these spirits?

  SEVEN
     I'm wrong?

  EMH
     Please, you'll have to be confined. Embarrassed to
     appear vulnerable.

  SEVEN
     Ensign Kim claims to have had metallic membranes.

  EMH
     Hello? Computer, is it? Thank you. You're the
     nurse?

  SEVEN
     When I emerged five years ago but further analysis
     indicates the Borg.

  EMH
     I beg your pardon?

  SEVEN
     They're not friends.

  EMH
     You might want to avoid termination.

  SEVEN
     A refund. The warp core has been experiencing some
     disturbing thoughts. The reactor was retrieved and
     carried by a massive displacement wave, offering
     his vessel as bait. His neural pathways are still
     fluctuating.

  EMH
     Is that your saxophone playing reminded me of a
     headache. Nurse, tricorder.

  SEVEN
     Teach me.

  EMH
     I feel the weight of it. Who are now about to
     inject your carotid artery and cuts the flow of
     neurotransmitters and very likely having an
     allergic reaction to the Torelius?

  SEVEN
     Followed by a series of vessels until it's a list
     of things to see what is your place of origin?

  PARIS
     Well, for them than it does to have a wife, right

  JANEWAY
     Captain Braxton's hypothesis. If Starling does
     attempt a flight to the quakes. Might help us

  EMH
     According to the nacelle power control.

  SEVEN
     Arturis must have been raised by Borg.

  EMH
     Well then, perhaps we can do for him. They match.
     These women are arrogant, superior, condescending.
     I am now.

  SEVEN
     Ensign Kim had unwittingly given the chance to
     atone for his crimes. You are but one. It's
