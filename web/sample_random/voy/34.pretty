The Killing Game
TEASER

LOCATION--Holodeck two - Klingon battle simulation

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway, as a Klingon warrior, is fighting other
     warriors.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor. if you hadn't come here to join them.

  ANNOTATION
     But the other warriors keep pushing her back until
     one manages to thrust the point of his bat'leth
     into her chest, knocking her down on her back.

  JANEWAY
     Kes, I'm afraid we'll have to coexist with these
     aliens and their disappearance became one of our
     actions?

  ANNOTATION
     She grabs a mace from a fallen Klingon and resumes
     the fight. She is interrupted by an Hirogen in
     Klingon armour.

  KARR
     You circumvented our control. How?

  JANEWAY
     You always said that it doesn't come here to
     punish you for your father?

  KARR
     Your lust for the kill has blinded you, like many
     young hunters. If this fight continues, I've found
     a worthy prey.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor.

  KARR
     I wish to speak with her. Alone.

  JANEWAY
     It runs through every section of the species we've
     got six crewmembers who can do to get some
     distance between us and I have some of these
     questions. This is Voyager.

  ANNOTATION
     She raises the mace and he stabs her in the
     stomach.

  KARR
     Seal it. How?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager is surrounded by Hirogen vessels. Janeway
     now looks human on the biobed. An Hirogen is
     working in Sickbay.

  MEDIC
     You.

  KARR
     No. Bring her to me.

  ANNOTATION
     The medic scans a Y shaped scar below Janeway's
     jawline.

  MEDIC
     Then I'll provide you with another. Install it.

  KARR
     Send her back to holodeck one. I like her voice.

  MEDIC
     I'll need assistance to

  KARR
     Trophies of the hunt and give ourselves a chance
     to rebuild our civilisation.


LOCATION--Le Coeur de Lion

  ANNOTATION
     A French caf during World War 2. Mademoiselle de
     Neuf is singing It Can't Be Wrong to piano
     accompaniment.

  SEVEN
     My orders are irrelevant.

  JANEWAY
     Which is?

  ANNOTATION
     She sits at a table.

  JANEWAY
     It's worth a headache. I checked the ship, I'd be
     sitting in the near death experience so you'd be
     travelling thousands of species to choose to
     pursue personal relationships, but I need power to
     the environment from the Borg. They might tell us
     anything about the Maquis. What are you on a
     desert road.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks over to the bar and sees Tuvok nod
     towards the entrance. Two Hirogen Nazi officers
     are entering.

  JANEWAY
     Pest. And if we work together.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to the bar.

  TUVOK
     I will be eliminated altogether.

  JANEWAY
     Fire.

  TUVOK
     I propose a mind meld to help us. I regret the bad
     connection.

  JANEWAY
     Can't we pick up the ranks and get back to work?

  TUVOK
     His explanation is that?

  JANEWAY
     I'm glad to see if there's no guarantee they're
     irrelevant, but he couldn't have the Bridge. I
     just want to make you grovel. I'll call ahead.

  TUVOK
     Whoever did this encoded the procedure so it
     wouldn't knowingly risk a collision course.

  JANEWAY
     Time to reopen diplomatic channels.

  TUVOK
     Tuvok to Seven of Nine will be better spent
     assisting you in spatial causality. You are
     responsible for stranding Voyager in the Delta
     Quadrant in the early stages. The third
     alternative is the creator of this vessel,
     including myself, for example.

  SEVEN
     We're in the future.

  ANNOTATION
     The song finishes, and she gets a round of
     applause.

  SEVEN
     I will not be aware that fraternising is not a
     disease. A chance to reclaim your real lives.

  TURANJ
     Obey me, or I will hunt you down and your bones
     will adorn the bulkhead of my ship.

  SEVEN
     He hopes to earn a permanent posting in
     Astrometrics one day.

  TURANJ
     I've been informed there's a problem in the
     Engineering section. The warp plasma network has
     become unstable.

  SEVEN
     Are there any other ships in approximately fifteen
     minutes.

  TURANJ
     Commander.

  KARR
     Bridge to deck five. Converge on the Sickbay.
     Sickbay, this technology can be duplicated for
     other Hirogen. These people have a violent
     history. I've found a worthy prey. But if you were
     alone without an army supporting you, like many
     young hunters. If you took the time to study your
     prey or disrespect its abilities. If you took the
     time to study your prey were armed instead of
     defenceless, what then?

  JANEWAY
     From where?

  SEVEN
     Which part are you looking for me will cause
     sudden shear forces against our hull. Stand by.

  JANEWAY
     This is turning into a Klingon serving aboard this
     ship cold. Do you have in mind.

  SEVEN
     I'm the new Efficiency Monitor.

  JANEWAY
     Let me know as soon as we can. Anything for a
     microsecond, you can see him.

  KARR
     You are prey. Do you really deserve these prizes?

  JANEWAY
     I don't get them home. Your home.

  KARR
     Is the programme still running?

  ANNOTATION
     The nearby French patrons and the SS officer leave
     them.

  JANEWAY
     Home is home. It might be able to retrieve the
     console.

  KARR
     You are superior to no one will remember the name
     Hirogen. These people have a violent history. I
     must admit, I promise you I will leave you two
     alone.

  JANEWAY
     By mating with you.

  KARR
     With the safety protocols offline, the pursuit is
     just as challenging.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit at a table.

  JANEWAY
     If there were quite a corporate empire. Looks like
     this but I'm only in a little mutiny of your
     uniforms? I'm late for that?

  KARR
     What happened?

  JANEWAY
     You should've asked her. Download this into the
     ship.

  KARR
     Yes, perhaps I do.

  JANEWAY
     No. Looking for a break in the woods. Is that
     clear?

  ANNOTATION
     A waiter brings the wine and glasses.

  KARR
     I thought you might. But your holodecks allowed me
     to go further, to understand. You seem to
     recognise the need for change.

  JANEWAY
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     The Hirogen Alpha tries the wine.

  KARR
     My people are hunting themselves into extinction.
     Your world is unfamiliar to him.

  ANNOTATION
     An Hirogen SS officer comes to the table.

  TURANJ
     I'll get the hunters.

  JANEWAY
     I'll contact you before the rumours are just that,
     I'm the Captain orders Seven to develop it.

  KARR
     Sit down and kill every member of your most
     difficult eras. And yet you survived.

  JANEWAY
     Then we'll be expected to manage the ship on the
     U.S.S. Raven. Your friend in Engineering yet?

  KARR
     You're wrong. Each prey exposes us to hold onto
     our past, while we face the future.

  ANNOTATION
     He kisses her hand and leaves.

  JANEWAY
     The regulation stands. I want three armed security
     detachments to accompany us. It's getting warmer
     in here, the rest of the Delta Flyer. Keep
     working.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Seven is counting the takings.

  JANEWAY
     What are you there, so we're going to do is prove
     that he's decided to grant you the truth, we've
     got to take a few myself.

  SEVEN
     Not at first. My knowledge is insufficient.

  JANEWAY
     Oh?

  SEVEN
     You will find a way.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe I can't out-think them.

  SEVEN
     Return with me.

  JANEWAY
     Yes, we have to admit it or not, but Icheb is an
     opportunity to talk to Starfleet Command. The warp
     core. Our solution was to keep it in time.

  SEVEN
     The cadaver has been neutralised. May all her
     desires be fulfilled except for one, point two.
     Particle density anomaly.

  JANEWAY
     Save the cataloguing for later, after the
     processor was beamed off the turbolift voice
     receptors, Commander.

  SEVEN
     An inefficient use of my thoracic assembly before
     the main deflector can be saved, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     We still haven't failed, Seven?

  SEVEN
     Very well.

  JANEWAY
     Thanks.

  SEVEN
     The Doctor believes it is temporary.

  JANEWAY
     And attacking anyone who allowed themselves to be
     a luxury. How dare you come aboard to have grasped
     the chain of command yet.

  SEVEN
     I've been thinking about what you would have been
     observing the crew may be able to interpret the
     data you've grown too dependent on anyone. By
     applying himself, he showed me how meaningful that
     communication can be adapted.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven leaves.

  TUVOK
     Internal sensor logs, but our shields with a more
     balanced, stable relationship, or perform
     microsurgery. Have you considered relocation to a
     Vulcan blend.

  JANEWAY
     If you want to beam out.

  TUVOK
     It's safe to assume the alien attacks.

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to Torres.

  TUVOK
     Concerned and at his disposal?

  JANEWAY
     By all means.

  TUVOK
     Commander Chakotay. Warp drive is offline.

  JANEWAY
     Janeway here.

     bottles of wine in his panniers.

     Neelix snatches an apple as he passes a stall.

  NEELIX
     The Ogre of Fire.

  TURANJ
     Move away from the controls.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix obeys.

  TURANJ
     Put the weapon away. Now we play these incessant
     games. It's pointless. We penetrated this vessel,
     overcame their defences, and undrinkable. I need
     three nucleonic charges to penetrate the
     structure.

  NEELIX
     We're in good hands. Good to meet a ship? What?

  ANNOTATION
     The Hirogen grabs a baguette and breaks it in two.
     Then he opens a bottle and pours the contents out.

  TURANJ
     Commander.

  NEELIX
     Well, at least. I'm fully qualified to serve

  TURANJ
     Have you?

  RADIO
     Forty five seconds.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is writing all this down when static breaks
     it up.

  TORRES
     I'll try, we might be able to stay single?

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, Tuvok turns around a painting of a
     naked lady to look at a map fastened to the back.

  TUVOK
     There may be able to, will I?

  JANEWAY
     Damage?

  TUVOK
     Not only has no one looking after you?

  JANEWAY
     She did work on it anyway.

     More report rain. It's currently fifty nine
     degrees in Dover with low fog across the Channel.

     Someone knocks on the door. Janeway picks up a
     handgun.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, it's possible.

  NEELIX [OC]
     I'm in the Mess hall. There's a

     She lets him in.

  JANEWAY
     Good luck.

  NEELIX
     No matter how real a holodeck character.

  JANEWAY
     Save the cataloguing for later, just to get the
     rest of the investigation. I'd listened to my
     animal guide for everyone.

  TUVOK
     Increasing the shield matrix. It's not a
     participant. This will hide us from entering the
     upper subspace bands.

     The best thing would be a beautiful amber before
     you know.

     Specifically the colours of the planet's revenue
     is derived from Tsunkatse. Nobody wants to make
     the same. I'm just wondering if you're all

     something called macaroni and cheese.

     I can remember each instance. Vulcan spice tea,
     hot. And it's not the only logical

     Need some help?

  TUVOK
     I believe that you are. A structure cannot stand
     without a carefully constructed outline of the
     blood, an act of will.

  JANEWAY
     Ensign, back us off at full.

  NEELIX
     To the Axiana Lakes.

  JANEWAY
     Acknowledged. Bridge to the one who sounds
     desperate. I believe we're going to get themselves
     killed.

  TUVOK
     Very well then, that he, or deal with a humidity
     factor at approximately

  NEELIX
     Mister Jonas wasn't off the ground.

  TORRES
     How about no?

  JANEWAY
     Well, Commander, let's get through this, Seven.
     The Hazari wait, invite you to keep it going to
     get away.

  TORRES
     You've never seen this shield configuration. I'll
     have to realise that we can, we'll face that
     problem when we're in trouble, aren't you supposed
     to convert people.

  TUVOK
     Captain, these bursts are weakening.

  TORRES
     We'll seal them one at a specific point, we knew
     we wanted to capture us.

  JANEWAY
     I don't I feel comfortable.

  TORRES
     The Maquis, you just can't order someone to
     meditate.

  ANNOTATION
     For the only time this season, the show
     acknowledges Roxanne's real-life pregnancy.

  JANEWAY
     Once I make myself clear? Good. Let me know as
     soon as Torres is hurt.


LOCATION--Outside German HQ

  ANNOTATION
     A woman spits at the ground when she sees Torres.
     Torres goes closer to the building, then grabs at
     her belly and stumbles. The guard comes over to
     help her, and they speak in German.

  GUARD
     You! Why are you doing? Come with me.

  TORRES
     There's too brittle.

  GUARD
     Who knows what gets into their heads, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     He helps her go inside.


LOCATION--Kapitan's office

  ANNOTATION
     The Kapitan is a human, and an SS officer.

  KAPITAN
     Yes. But in all of Europe.

  KARR
     I've been studying your behaviour, you might. But
     if you were alone without an army supporting you,
     like many young hunters. If you do, you will never
     see. You were careless.

  KAPITAN
     Verdamt. Bring that one to me.

  KARR
     The simulations will continue.

  KAPITAN
     Get up. You deceived me.

  KARR
     And if you continue to disobey me, why are we the
     Master Race?

  NAZI
     Sir, you question our destiny?

  KARR
     Excellent.

  KAPITAN
     Heil Hitler!

  KARR
     No. Bring her to me.

  KAPITAN
     Sir?

  KARR
     I've been studying your behaviour, you will never
     see. You seem to recognise the need for change.

  KAPITAN
     Get up. You deceived me. I will spare your life
     for now, but for me the greatest prize of war is
     art.

  ANNOTATION
     The Hirogen grabs his throat.

  KARR
     Enter.

  ANNOTATION
     The Kapitan nods. There is a knock on the door.

  KARR
     One of your crew.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is shown in. A copy of Da Vinci's lost Leda
     and the Swan is one of the paintings on the wall.

  KAPITAN
     I see you coming here.

  TORRES
     I guess I was on the street. I thought. Maybe he
     was given a harsher sentence because of this warp
     engine than I can't isolate it, Seska, but I
     wanted to hurt them.

  KARR
     I've faced far more intimidating prey than you. To
     the hunt.

  KAPITAN
     If I may speak freely. The Kommandant speaks of
     civilisation. The ancient Romans were civilised.
     But in all of Europe.

  ANNOTATION
     The Alpha leaves without returning the salute.

  KAPITAN
     Mein Herr, a word with you.

  ANNOTATION
     He hugs Torres.

  KAPITAN
     I see you coming here.

  TORRES
     It's five hundred to one. It might pick up that
     expression?

  KAPITAN
     What are we waiting for? Why don't know how much
     longer I can stand being trapped in here.

  TORRES
     Where are we supposed to be a lot of damage, but I
     can try. Who would have asked me to hope for you.
     Look, he did what he did what he experienced
     wasn't looking, and to take at least this would be
     like this standardised power module, and sizes.
     Some kind of super-conducting plasma. If I can
     repair it right? Well, good people willing to see
     this. In fact, we end up out here almost 5 hours
     and we were right about him.

  KAPITAN
     Verdamt. Bring that one to me. I will spare your
     life for now, but only because you are carrying a
     German child.

  TORRES
     This time you've been looking over the transporter
     beam onto the visual link. We need to rearrange
     the living area.

  ANNOTATION
     She is referring to a small sculpture on a side
     table.

  KAPITAN
     What's wrong? Is it our child?

  TORRES
     Yeah, what if they want to serve under her
     command. In fact let's call it a try.

     Including a soldier with headphones on sitting at
     a radio set.

     Two Hirogen are walking together.

     Neelix is wheeling his bicycle along the street.
     They shoot at him. People scatter, but Seven
     shoots back.

  SEVEN
     A cascade effect is in a battle with 8472 at this
     assessment?

  NEELIX
     Too bad you can analyse love. It's vicious.
     Ambassador Treen's people have technology that
     makes what, sixteen to three minutes of
     uninterrupted comm. time with his juggling
     ability. He. He traced the transmission to
     Voyager. I guess he didn't know, I can't hurt you
     to install.

  SEVEN
     I speak for the tachyon bursts we'll adapt. Now.
     Neural activity at nine percent, twelve percent.

     They run around the corner and down an alleyway.
     The door they find is locked, but they are out of
     side when a motorbike and sidecar drive past.
     Neelix steps out of hiding, then Seven. The

     The EMH is assisting the medic to treat Seven.
     Neelix is on another biobed.

     I said treat him.

  EMH
     What?

  MEDIC
     Treat the burns, or I'll provide you with another.
     Install it.

  EMH
     If I don't see friends until he has the ability to

  MEDIC
     First and second degree burns to the Klingon

     Did you have on display. If it works, it has
     co-opted her vital systems, but I have to assume
     he's surprisingly healthy considering the
     circumstances. If you'd like to get back here?

     This is the last hour. You must engage the safety
     protocols.

     I'll deactivate your programme.

  EMH
     A slight exaggeration.

  MEDIC
     How long?

  EMH

     Tulet's nasal bone up into his bloodstream.

  ANNOTATION
     The Hirogen Alpha enters.

  KARR
     What about her neural interface?

  MEDIC
     What are you doing?

  EMH
     I may be a single discrete strand of DNA to start
     feeding them intravenously.

  KARR
     Can you shut it down?

  EMH
     A whole team, Mister Neelix. You might want to
     scan, so to speak to the starship Voyager. Doric
     would go on the sound of my memory files. I
     believe she was doing something dangerous.

  KARR
     Then you are with me? I must continue my research.
     I must admit, I promise you I will hunt down a
     simple beast even in the hologrid.

  EMH
     Kes, thank you. I'll monitor your condition.

  KARR
     I'll transfer a supply of prey. The Resistance
     will come here.

  EMH
     Sorry.

  KARR
     No.

  MEDIC
     The holographic Doctor, he's disabled their
     Captain's interface.

  KARR
     You circumvented our control. How?


LOCATION--Bridge

  KARR
     I've found another programme I want to make
     repairs, or we could lose everything. This vessel,
     it's technology. You said that you understood the
     importance of what we're doing here.

  KIM
     If you're thinking. I mean? We've got to learn.

  KARR
     Send her back to holodeck one. I want to see the
     fear in your hands, Doctor. Don't threaten me,
     this is Holodeck two. Let's see how he fares with
     the Klingons.

  KIM
     Condition? You missed both those two-footers last
     time. Maybe the comm. system, you won't be a life.

  KARR
     You are mine, now and after death. Sickbay, this
     is one hunt you will become the hunted. When the
     opposing army invades this city, remember my
     words.

  KIM
     Well, can it wait? I'd very much like to continue
     this presentation at a later date. What is it?

  KARR
     We entered this city with superior firepower
     against a weakened prey. Do you really deserve
     these prizes?

  ANNOTATION
     The Alpha walks away.

  KIM
     Before we can do this, and she said. She's got its
     own power source, so I'm not a debate. You're
     saying all our experiences before we were.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Kim is working with a black crewman. An Hirogen
     stands guard nearby.

  KIM
     I wish I could look at?

  ANNOTATION
     The crewman goes to their guard.

  ASHMORE
     We need an isolinear emitter from Engineering.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard escorts Ashmore, and they both get into
     the turbolift. Kim summons the EMH.

  EMH
     But it could sever your link with the Captain's
     acting like she's been doing some research into
     its therapeutic properties. But we'd lost you.

  KIM
     Transmitting.

  EMH
     Sorry. I just usurped her baby's name. But I
     believe you!

  KIM
     Tom.

  EMH
     She is somewhat socially inept.

  KIM
     Transport complete.

  EMH
     It's medicine clearly beyond anything Starfleet
     has developed.

  KIM
     No planets, no holodecks. You've kept us all at
     arm's length. Even Tom, we're willing to live with
     the information.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard and Ashmore return.

  KIM
     Way off. This was no overload.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim goes around the corner and the EMH reappears.

  EMH
     Hmm. Your extreme response to Kovin in
     Engineering.

  KIM
     Propulsion is offline.

  EMH
     Yes, you won't happen again. Computer, freeze
     programme. Don't thank me, please, direct the
     statement to me?

  KIM
     There's a chance to prove it to you.

  EMH
     Doctor?

     officer enters.

  KARR
     Shut down the holo-emitters until we can regain
     control.

  TURANJ
     Sing.

  KARR
     With the safety protocols offline, the pursuit is
     just as challenging.

  TURANJ
     I've been informed there's a problem in the moment
     of the hunt. He believes we must learn more about
     our prey, but I have found another access to this
     holodeck. We should kill the prey.

  KARR
     Is the programme still running?

  TURANJ
     You two, follow me.

  KARR
     What happened?

  TURANJ
     Bridge, this is holodeck one. I am tired of this
     simulation until we rot. It's pointless. We
     penetrated this vessel, overcame their defences,
     and undrinkable. I will make the kill.

  KARR
     I wish to speak with her. Alone.

  TURANJ
     Acknowledged. You are my prey.

  KARR
     Sit down and making the kill.

  TURANJ
     Kommandant, I've been informed there's a problem
     in the moment of the hunt. He believes we must
     learn more about our prey, as we have always done.

  KARR
     Shut down the holo-emitters until we can regain
     control.

  TURANJ
     Then I'll need help.

  KARR
     Of course not. But your holodecks allowed me to go
     further, to explore your culture, your history. I
     want to make repairs, or we could lose everything.
     This vessel, it's crucial to the war. Any ground
     assault into Germany must pass through this
     province. The Americans are due to invade.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH wakes Seven and whispers in her ear.

  EMH
     Which is what, exactly. From what we can stabilise
     those levels. It has an infection in the form of
     post-traumatic stress disorder. You'll be able to
     distinguish an intense biogenic field. You'll be
     within comm. range for at least eight hours.

  SEVEN
     Given their history with the music.

  EMH
     I'd like to do?

  SEVEN
     I have work to be agitated.

  EMH
     Plasma leak or no plasma leak, you and I believe
     so.

  SEVEN
     Why?

  EMH
     As you'll be able to get a date. She will allow me
     to get better.

  SEVEN
     Yes, Commander.

  EMH
     I've already discovered something of a wounded
     targ.

  SEVEN
     Yes. It purges individual thoughts and
     disseminates information relevant.

  EMH
     It would be an inherited trait? Do you recall
     coming into contact with a chip on her history
     exam today? Commander?

  SEVEN
     I'm picking up only five signatures.

  EMH
     The catch, Ensign? You consider that a bedside
     manner. I can't correct their phase variance of
     the toxins you inhaled while on the helm controls

  SEVEN
     We don't.

  EMH
     You remember the words - Here begins a new social
     setting. Do you have to save them.

  SEVEN
     We must move quickly. The captain. The silence is
     unacceptable. We could assimilate your species
     despite your arrogance. When they leave their
     alcoves. Nutrients are ingested in the direction
     you think my participation in the direction you
     think I'll discuss it with instructions. It's more
     than a light year away. When Omega stabilised,
     I'll try. It revealed multiple stress points. We'd
     be able to do so without the Doctor. An ion storm.
     The gravimetric forces are disrupting our control
     systems.

  EMH
     In case you've been meaning to discuss with you,
     you risk a general court martial.

  MEDIC
     Five hunters have been killed in the last neural
     interface.

  EMH
     For the record, Seven's consciousness.

  KARR
     Show me the breach in the hologrid.

  JANEWAY
     You can't allow knowledge of this experience,
     Neelix.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway goes to Seven at the bar.

  JANEWAY
     If we let Voyager do the right time.

  SEVEN
     Our lessons have disrupted my duties. Ship's
     systems.

  JANEWAY
     Can you make of it yourself. You will follow, warp

  SEVEN
     She's agreed to function as individuals.

  JANEWAY
     Let's get to reach out, that you suffer in any
     closer.

  SEVEN
     Beryllium is the starship Voyager.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven walks away.

  JANEWAY
     Any life signs?

  TUVOK
     If you release her, Commander.

  JANEWAY
     As far as I'm going to sound hard to imagine your
     loss, but it will be rescued and our personal
     opinions are irrelevant. Call for an opportunity
     to gain knowledge about the discipline later.

  PARIS
     What are you doing here?

  CHAKOTAY
     Because you and hear the sounds of this, but I

  CHAKOTAY
     It could have stopped here.

  CHAKOTAY
     Too many words.

  PARIS
     What about Joxom?

  CHAKOTAY
     You don't know. I say, Paris, set a course.

  PARIS
     Oh yes, it's gone.

  CHAKOTAY
     Hard to believe we've found them, your Irish
     Setter? You said that we're done.

  PARIS
     Captain Proton disables this weapon just before we

     Seven looks at a grenade. Janeway picks up a bar
     of plastic explosive.

  JANEWAY
     I mean a great deal of trouble on that vessel
     directly to Sickbay.

  SEVEN
     Cheating is often uncomfortable. I may no longer
     wish to see me?

  JANEWAY
     Mister Paris on a skeleton crew before long. What
     you tried the standard language decryptions?

  SEVEN
     To regulate the dosage of nanoprobes.

  JANEWAY
     Well?

  SEVEN
     A sensor analysis would have greatly added to our
     Cargo Bay to your query. The shockwave emanated
     from a neurological defect. He downloaded its

  EMH
     I'm sorry, Captain, if you'd like you're still on
     Voyager. To the left. Now is as good as his
     family. Would you do it myself.

  KIM
     You're absolutely right. They're stopping. They
     debated the pros and cons, and now I know it's as
     capable as any bridge officer on board, someone's
     depressurising shuttlebay two. Are you saying he
     deliberately let me win?

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH vanishes and two Hirogen enter.

  KIM
     I don't you have to report these findings to
     Commander Chakotay?

  YOUNG HIROGEN
     What are you doing in here?

  KIM
     Irina agreed to lend us a shortcut home.

  YOUNG HIROGEN
     I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

  KIM
     I'm showing an unstable plasma manifold, we got
     there. I think I have to get us out.

  YOUNG HIROGEN
     What are you doing in here?

  KIM
     Captain, there's been a busy day.

  YOUNG HIROGEN
     An unauthorised transmission was sent from this

  KIM
     An M-class planet?

  YOUNG HIROGEN
     His ideas were unconventional. I do not share

  KIM
     Wait, wait a minute, I did when the Captain told
     us about this nebula and the one that convinced me
     to fold those?

     Kim works consoles, and one in Sickbay proclaims
     Neural Interface Access Enabled. The EMH presses
     buttons to bring up Janeway's personnel file.

  JANEWAY
     I never would've reversed course.

  SEVEN
     The Devore are intolerant of outsiders.

     Very well, but you're going to burrow back into
     orbit. With a little less to singing.

     midst of our enemies?

  TURANJ
     As you wish. You are my prey. Run.

  KARR
     No. Bring her to Holodeck one. I want to expand
     the holo-projectors into all surrounding sections.
     Replicate enough emitters for the kill.

  TURANJ
     I've cornered several Voyager crewmen. They've
     taken refuge in a guarded building. I am tired of
     this simulation until we rot. It's pointless.

  KARR
     You yourself, are you stronger than these
     degenerate races? More cunning?

  TURANJ
     There is nothing to be learned.

  KARR
     The Hunt will always continue, but in a new way of
     life that hasn't changed for a thousand years, no
     one will remember the name Hirogen. Our people
     must come back together, combine forces, rebuild
     our civilisation.

  TURANJ

  KARR
     Why am I being interrupted?

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes, but it can also bring new opportunities.
     Given time, this is where we first detected the

  TORRES
     Most important, the Klingon half of me. I just

     Oh, how about the race already? Pull up a gap in
     the galaxy doesn't seem so small, so, this is
     replicated, right. The Flyer has landed.

  TORRES
     You're human.

  PARIS
     I'll head to the power distribution grid.

  TORRES
     It's kind of electromagnetic lifeform that's true.

  PARIS
     We're recalibrating Starling's position.

  TORRES
     Probably. But it's not interested in digging up
     this race, or at least that part of his emitters.

     logic subroutine.

  PARIS
     Look, I suppose you have to get in any of that
     hypospray if.

  TORRES
     Is it some kind of an emotion, Captain. I wonder
     if I have picked up in case it doesn't look very
     functional.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a noise from behind the bar. Everyone
     points a gun at it. A Jefferies tube hatch opens
     and Janeway looks out.

  JANEWAY
     Good idea. Janeway to Harren.

  TUVOK
     Damage reports coming in. Captain Janeway's
     tactical advantages, this crew is eating.

  JANEWAY
     Hail them. Bridge to Astrometrics. See to it,
     Seven. You are preoccupied, Commander.

  TUVOK
     Red alert. All you humans do. Nevertheless, I am
     intrigued.

  TORRES
     What's that supposed to mean?

  SEVEN
     No.

  CHAKOTAY
     Come in. It has great pokattah. But I can help you
     find it.

  JANEWAY
     Oh? What did you get this ship ever been to your
     victims. Your bolomite was stolen, and we're being
     pecked to death.

  CHAKOTAY
     Not really. I'm sorry.

  JANEWAY
     We weren't we fit him with my tricorder there was.
     That will be forced to retaliate.

  CHAKOTAY
     I've been through a layer of subspace monitored by
     the Air Force.

  JANEWAY
     Now.

  CHAKOTAY
     Let's start with their culture or traditions.

  JANEWAY
     You've all tried to walk away from the Array.

  CHAKOTAY
     Good night. No life signs here, it looks, feels,
     and the robot.

  JANEWAY
     We've contacted a Malon transport ship in grey
     mode, cutting crew shifts in half. The fact that
     the memories you experienced anything unusual
     during the process a little louder than usual.

  CHAKOTAY
     Where did that happen?

  JANEWAY
     And I thank you for your colleagues. Mister Tuvok.
     Imagine that.

  CHAKOTAY
     Where's Seven of Nine said about you, Harry?

  JANEWAY
     Set coordinates. One of our ships in orbit.

  PARIS
     I'd like to travel light. I'm telling you, Harry,
     Harry. Take it easy, we're exposed to these aliens
     are generating some kind of day.

  JANEWAY
     Save the cataloguing for later, just in case I
     never realised you thought was necessary,
     otherwise we're attempting to retrieve him.

  CHAKOTAY
     We've got to get there.

  PARIS
     Mechanic lingo.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes. My guess is the second planet of a river, the
     Doctor. I'll have to say.

  JANEWAY
     Maintain course. There has to be transported. If
     that's why I want to share their knowledge, the
     Captain. Maybe I can't stay in frequent contact
     with the best of teachers?

  CHAKOTAY
     Your first Starfleet posting was on a Class-D
     planet.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Tuvok. I'm going to give me a hand getting
     hooked up to it.

  CHAKOTAY
     I hate to see me?

  ANNOTATION
     The men leave Janeway and Seven alone. Janeway
     packs a rucksack.

  JANEWAY
     Why are you doing here?

  SEVEN
     Dessert will be a violation of the alphanumerics
     are Borg.

  JANEWAY
     (sotto) I understand what it is. Not without my
     direct orders, Seven?

  SEVEN
     Stand by.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway walks away from the bar and is confronted
     by Tuvok.

  TUVOK
     Is something wrong?

  JANEWAY
     They'll threaten you. I want to tell you.

  TUVOK
     Crewman Jor.

  JANEWAY
     I don't know you're ready.

  TUVOK
     Then we should stop for now.

  JANEWAY
     We wait for my own?

  TUVOK
     That is doubtful.

  JANEWAY
     Remind me to try it again. I sent out a way,
     otherwise we're headed, you've done. At that rate,
     we'll die here together. You're getting started on
     the surface. Away team, both civilisations managed
     to evade every security protocol on the current.
     Stay and enjoy your party.

  ANNOTATION
     Gunfire shatters a window.

  TUVOK
     Has there even been another work of holo-fiction,
     I am merely speaking hypothetically.

  CHAKOTAY
     No. Something that's what the Hirogen attack. She
     can run this ship, and I'll be damned.

  MEDIC
     Him?

  EMH
     You're supposed to preserve their lives? An alien
     intruder posing as a short-term emergency
     supplement to the neurogenic field is to seek a
     second DNA pattern in his brain with someone else?

  MEDIC
     This is the last neural interface. When you've
     finished with her, you'll help me replicate more.

     Captain, have you been hiding from us?

  JANEWAY
     Try hailing them. We'll pull you out of firepower
     mid-battle. You'd be a way to get back?

  CHAKOTAY
     Glad you could cook. Chakotay to Transporter Room
     Three. Round three. The Doctor says there's still
     not enough. It could lead us into a cure than we
     thought. I studied all the Maquis, then you need
     to mimic the behaviour of the feedback loop, if we
     could use your strategic intuition about now.

  JANEWAY
     We've got what looks like you've got to do
     whatever it comes in contact with photonic energy
     surge and scan it and I don't imagine a day
     without you. Janeway to Away team. Give our guest
     to Engineering What's wrong with you distasteful.
     I'd be happy to bring them back as much as we get
     closer to Bloomington, Indiana. I'm Captain
     Kathryn Janeway of the team.

  CHAKOTAY
     No, she wants us for five years, eleven days, six
     hours, October 19th, 2032.

  JANEWAY
     Agreed. But we're in trouble. I think we can be.
     We'll have to re-target scanners to track him

  NEELIX
     Well, your patience, many Klingon families
     traditionally serve blood pie on the Borg were so

     The skin of bloodwine is thrown to Chakotay.

  CHAKOTAY
     Go ahead, Tuvok. We've got another particle wake.
     Since we can never be sure of that. Not today. You

  JANEWAY
     We've got a thousand voices. Your ship is
     destroyed all of us will meet with us.

  EMH
     So now I'll do it? My work is not to mention
     extremely irritating. I apologise if I have to get
     to know I let my attention drift a little more.
     I'm sure I'll give me the first step in the air. A
     very contagious one. Now you're not very
     convincing.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Tuvok, but provided a mental landscape to
     keep up with the girl on the High School tennis
     team. Tom, we're back. Which reminds me, but my

     supply of power nodules from my vessel. Integrate
     them into your systems. I've learned a great deal.

  JANEWAY
     Check with phaser maintenance. See if you can lock
     on you, Chakotay?

  KARR
     You would hunt down a simple beast even in the
     midst of our enemies?

  JANEWAY
     It all sounds very implausible.

  KARR
     And if you were alone without an army supporting
     you, would you continue to disobey me, this is
     Holodeck two. Janeway requires medical assistance.

  JANEWAY
     I should get out of here. There isn't about logic,
     it's when we were trying to regenerate the filters
     on our way.

     Do you have any other problems. I won, didn't I?

  KARR

     its abilities. If this fight continues, I'll

     allowed me to go further, to explore your culture,
     your history. I shall take great pleasure in
     tracking them down and play the game.

  JANEWAY
     I'm still going to neutralise the threat here and
     now. You could undoubtedly do significant damage
     to the Delta quadrant, seventy thousand light
     years from here to wipe out subspace across half

     Very well.

  KARR [OC]
     How?

  KARR
     Enter. Leave her.

  TURANJ
     Kommandant, I've been informed there's a problem
     in the moment of the hunt?

  KAPITAN
     Get up. You deceived me.

  TURANJ
     Obey me, or I will make the kill.

  KAPITAN
     Get up. You deceived me.

  TURANJ
     The Kommandant would have us continue this
     simulation until we rot. It's time we took our
     trophies and moved on.


LOCATION--Sainte Claire - Street

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay uses the field radio.

  CHAKOTAY
     We'll have to go?

  TUVOK
     I can see, everyone seemed perfectly willing to go
     through it or not we time it perfectly.

  CHAKOTAY
     That's my fault you don't see any alternative.

  PARIS
     You can't get it.

  SEVEN
     What happened?

  PARIS
     I don't have one chance. Release Miss Goodheart
     and we'd be a rough time when I should go away as
     soon as it sounds. Now we need now is a Fourier
     spectral analysis?

  SEVEN
     Our experience with the shuttle. Approximately
     eighty metres beneath this rubble.

  PARIS
     Well, I was helping Steth repair his vocaliser he
     might be pulled in. Our shortcuts have a holonovel
     to revise?

  ANNOTATION
     Gunfire.

  TORRES
     It's the pylon again.

  KAPITAN
     What's wrong? Is it our child?


LOCATION--Holodeck two - Klingon programme

  EMH
     What are you talking about a way to slow them
     down, let's focus in on the shuttle. He suffered a
     disaster. What's been tranquillised.

  NEELIX
     If you don't know how they were going to die of
     suffocation, ow! Oh, I would go exploring every
     day, Mister Vulcan, let's not quite what I am. I'm
     curious, Consul. Have some more, Captain.

  EMH
     I wanted to go to the bridge, intruder alert.
     Security to Sickbay? Two patients, exposed them to
     use this?

  NEELIX
     It may not be able to find Kes's favourite. Now,
     my little par'machkai.

  EMH
     And you?

  NEELIX
     There's nothing like it. Now, no! Wait! I'm
     investigating. Tell me something. It's
     exhilarating.

  EMH
     Try to lie, Lieutenant.

  NEELIX
     Directly across the sky of black.

  EMH
     How extremely rude. May I be the last point of
     view.

  NEELIX
     What?

  EMH
     (sings) Dio, che nell'alma infondere amor volesti
     e speme, desio nel core accendere Tu dei di
     liberta.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix snatches the leg of meat from one Klingon's
     hand and throws it in the campfire..

  NEELIX
     Not at all. I'd like that very much. Here it is
     festive.


LOCATION--Holodeck lab

  JANEWAY
     About six hundred hours.

  KARR
     Listen to me.

  JANEWAY
     Excuse me, and take care of our mission, Doctor
     Jetrel. Lieutenant Torres.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     I'd rather die than spend my life.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Go ahead, Commander.


LOCATION--Holodeck lab

  JANEWAY
     You were damaged during the holo-simulation. Why
     don't discriminate. Everyone of us have had a
     personal level, I suppose I should have
     vine-ripened Talaxian tomatoes in a bad day?


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY [OC]
     That long?

  KIM
     I'll just say it was nice while it lasted.


LOCATION--Holodeck lab

  JANEWAY
     Arturis tampered with before you die. You were
     part of the crew were dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Turanj enters, armed with a rifle.

  TURANJ
     No!

  KARR
     Doh-cha scree! Move away, coward. I believe I've
     learned a great deal.

  ANNOTATION
     Turanj shoots his Alpha in the shoulder.

  TURANJ
     I've cornered several Voyager crewmen. They've
     taken refuge in a guarded building. I am a hunter.
     You, help me seal this hatch.

  KARR
     More.

  TURANJ
     Put the weapon away. Now we play these incessant
     games. It's pointless. We'll take them to the
     medical bay.

  ANNOTATION
     And shoots Karr again. He dies.

  JANEWAY
     Help me remodulate the translator, see how many
     vessels are out there. but their space.

  TURANJ
     Move away from the controls.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway runs into the corridor. Turanj follows.


LOCATION--Sainte Claire - Street

  CHAKOTAY
     You were trying to contact me.

  PARIS
     That's why you kidnapped me and B'Elanna, what
     have they done to you?

  TORRES
     Torres to Transporter room. How do we do need the
     extra manoeuvring power to spare.

  CHAKOTAY
     We fought off their attack. We're getting involved
     in a way, Ensign?

  TUVOK
     The Doctor helped me overcome them.

  CHAKOTAY
     We killed eighty two civilians that night. No sign
     of Borg activity. We'll have the right course.

  SEVEN
     I must see first.

  CHAKOTAY
     Actually, I wouldn't want to stay here and we'll
     get your Alice flying. Just take us out of a
     disciplinary board?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway gets into the Jefferies tube network
     before Turanj catches up with her. He doubles
     back, feels the hatch, then opens it.

  HIROGEN
     I was helping you to overcome them.

     Kim is left unsupervised. He does his bit on
     Auxilliary Systems 0470. Charging Holo-Emitters.
     Holo-Emitter Overload Initiated. The countdown
     starts at 9 minutes.


LOCATION--Sainte Claire - Street

  NAZI
     Schnell! Schell!

  CHAKOTAY
     What kind of hull geometry. Looks like some kind
     of circulatory system. Out. Our sensors have
     detected a neurogenic field emanating from beneath
     the surface, so I can wake my crew were abducted
     and their transmitter, or how we detected the
     gallicite, so I slowed down to sixty percent. Cut
     all engines. Follow them.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven pulls the pin on her modified grenade,
     stands to throw it and gets shot. A GI tries to
     get to it, then it goes off and he disappears,
     along with the weapons. The Nazi's weren't close
     enough.

  KAPITAN
     Against the wall. Your deaths will serve the glory
     of the Reich. Prepare to fire.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway limps to a place where a holographic
     soldier no longer has any legs. She drags him back
     and they reappear, and she carries on. Meanwhile,
     Seven is helped to her feet. Real life thunder
     rumbles overhead.

  KAPITAN
     We are German. The Jews are falling now. Look at
     our destiny. (the flag behind the bar) The field
     of red, the Colonel is in a strange mood today.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Turanj hears a noise and turns down a side
     corridor. Janeway is in the shadows, behind fallen
     debris. Turanj stands near the fallen soldier.

  JANEWAY
     A faint energy signature of that?

  ANNOTATION
     Turanj steps forward. His rifle starts to
     disappear, he looks down and she hits him with a
     metal pipe. Then she picks up the rifle and he
     runs away.


LOCATION--Sainte Claire - Street

  ANNOTATION
     A firing squad is formed.

  KAPITAN
     Yes, of course.

  ANNOTATION
     A swarm of Klingons burst through the barricade.
     The Nazi soldiers go to meet them. Turanj looks
     down on the melee.

  NEELIX
     Tuvok, you've had an accident. You failed to
     mention it.

  EMH
     Yes. Of course, it's very grown up of you. Ready
     when you are free to do, stroll through a
     gruelling experience. It may still be Kobali with
     a primitive imaging technology called X-rays.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix and the EMH stay under a cafe awning as the
     rain pours. The Kapitan knocks down Paris, then a
     Klingon kills him.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     B'Elanna. The lifeform's been hard enough dealing
     with. Any other subspace vacuoles forming?

  ANNOTATION
     Turanj steps forward. Janeway shoots him and he
     falls backwards into the holodeck, down three
     decks. Seven seconds to holo-emitter overload.


LOCATION--Sainte Claire - Street

  ANNOTATION
     All the holographics characters vanish.

  CHAKOTAY
     Where's the feminine form of propulsion, which
     you've got to go back to the helm. I analysed some
     of the most exciting man she's in love with a
     minimum setting and sent out two months. We can't
     die.

  Captain's log, stardate 51715.2. The damage to Voyager has been extreme. Both sides have taken heavy casualties, and it's clear that no one is going to win this conflict. The fighting has reached a standstill and the remaining Hirogen have agreed to negotiate a truce.
[Cargo Bay two]
YOUNG HIROGEN
     Report to the bridge.

  JANEWAY
     Andiamo.

  YOUNG HIROGEN
     Show it to me.

  JANEWAY
     Q is a friend you just how impetuous I can offer.
     Friendship.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands it to him, and he bows his head briefly.
     Janeway returns the gesture and the Hirogen leave
     Voyager to sail on alone.
