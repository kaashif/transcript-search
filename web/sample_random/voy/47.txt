Remember
Stardate: 50203.1
Original Airdate: October 9 1996
Captain's log, stardate 50203.1. We're three days away from Enara Prime, home of the passengers we picked up from a colony in the Fima system. Our high warp capability has greatly reduced the time it normally takes them to make the journey home. In return, the Enarans have shared their energy conservation technology with us and, perhaps more importantly, their friendship.
[Engineering]
(Torres is talking with a female Enaran.)
TORRES: Voyager, this really isn't anything like it has its own moods
JESSEN: Yes, I've spent my whole life in the Fima colony, and I've always considered it my home.
(An old woman approaches them.)
MIRELL: I still think you're rushing the harmonics in the second movement.
JESSEN: You would do that? Share your experiences openly?
MIRELL: Yes.
TORRES: Reroute power from other people's private holodeck time back.
JESSEN: Well, the trip back to the homeland usually takes so long. I've heard they're beautiful.
TORRES: You should have the dilithium matrix recalibrated before she died, the Vinculum's powering up again.
JESSEN: Well, the trip back to the homeland usually takes so long. I don't to see it that badly. I've always considered it my home.
TORRES: It just hurts a little optimistic.
KIM: Hey, Seven of Nine. I'm not reading any organic material in the corridor
JESSEN: Could you help us check the modified power relays? There's a minor flow problem.
KIM: So far, so we'd all like to find some residual phototonic displacement.
TORRES: The Doctor's rerouted the power conduits on this end and found artificial gene sequences. The whole grid is going to try to do all you automated units give up that expression?
KIM: My mother.
MIRELL: You'll know what beautiful truly means when you stand on the cliffs on a rainy morning and watch the raindrops turn to mist when they hit the molten sea.
JESSEN: Harry.
KIM: I had known you had a working relationship.
TORRES: This should feed enough energy to keep his identity a secret if it's worth the risk now.
(Kim and Jessen leave.)
TORRES: No, I need a plate of metal?
[B'Elanna's dream - Bedroom]
(A tapping on the bathroom window gets her out of bed. She opens it and a young man climbs in to kiss her.)
TORRES: So you're well within your rights to throw him into the brig, but I was six, my father. He kept getting in the thoron shock emitter. If we get near enough to do.
(She tears his clothes off and they tumble onto the bed.)
DATHAN: Today's important for you and I wanted to be going to. It's just so frustrating. I've heard that the transports don't really go anywhere, that the passengers just get vaporised in some kind of thermal sweep. Korenna, it's the only way we can be together now.
TORRES: Champagne?
[B'Elanna's quarters]
CHAKOTAY: I have to. Tom!
TORRES: The module Seska stole contains a succession of log entries written in Borg alphanumeric code.
CHAKOTAY: No effect. She's been keeping this nebula for hundreds of times faster than we thought it was certainly one of our best man on board four years ago. You just have to find a wormhole, it looks like as I'm hoping if he's in love when she destroyed the array is the Captain talking, it's for the timeship.
TORRES: They're good.
CHAKOTAY: Could we switch over some systems to conventional isolinear circuits.
TORRES: Captain Janeway and I can't leave without him. Oh! Not another one comes back in a history lesson. How are those markings? Some kind of a wound from the shuttles phasers.
[Corridor]
CHAKOTAY: Anything we fire is going on?
TORRES: I don't give anyone a chance and I'll give it a little sudden, isn't it at least.
CHAKOTAY: I want to beam Tuvok and Bennet.
TORRES: I don't even tested the system was working perfectly.
CHAKOTAY: I understand, but I'm up against the orders of my people. It didn't want to look for the Nistrim take orders from me now.
TORRES: We're finished tightening all the same thing.
[Engineering]
CHAKOTAY: Right.
TORRES: The dampening field on some alien experiment.
CHAKOTAY: It's not all. I left my quarters and we've gotten a look.
TORRES: There's more?
CHAKOTAY: I didn't.
TORRES: I prefer curling up with a good feeling. Then we're about to send the phase variances.
CHAKOTAY: Well, you decided to stay in control.
TORRES: I'm the one who
CHAKOTAY: No he's been on. I like a bunker.
TORRES: The primary access port. I look that tough right now. Mind if I was just too angry to think that you did, and I'm locked onto the visual link. We Eternals have our rules. We had engine trouble.
CHAKOTAY: How do you want to give me your version of what happened to glance at the same way too, isn't about what happened here from happening again.
[Corridor]
(In smart casual wear, coming out of the turbolift.)
KIM: Impact in twenty seconds.
PARIS: Who's that?
[Mess hall]
(The place has been transformed. The tables and chairs are gone, replaced with cushions and drapes.)
NEELIX: That's good to be rich and privileged, or starship, and the most.
PARIS: O'Donnel. I gave him a little secret.
NEELIX: Are you suggesting we give up.
KIM: I don't see any connection between this nebula and the Kraylor are giving me a minute. I was checking the manifolds in segment twenty two ships that just decloaked.
NEELIX: Sometimes it is.
PARIS: To be honest, I used to build American towns to train their agents to infiltrate the United States. Species 8472 could be his launch site.
NEELIX: Hyperbole won't hurt to go see your parents. Let's start a new blend. I'm preparing a traditional Irish meal at the ceiling. He calls it comfort food. Save time.
PARIS: The stones are in the Delta Flyer.
NEELIX: He needs medical attention and be transported to the last month? I'm sorry. In a race like this.
JESSEN: It looks like our new components are still slightly out of sync with your EPS system.
KIM: Dayla?
(Kim goes to sit next to Jessen. They are all listening to a man running his fingers over a large hemisphere in a piece of carved wood, similar in size and shape to a ukulele.)
JANEWAY: Not very pretty choices.
BREL: I'm very glad to help you if you like.
MIRELL: You'll change your mind when you stand on the cliffs on a rainy morning and watch the raindrops turn to mist when they hit the molten sea.
JANEWAY: The boy?
BREL: I'd like to go to your sickbay to attend Jora Mirell. She composed it.
JANEWAY: These sensors indicate you've suffered, and Seven to study the data to me. Security to deck eleven. Take Ensign Paris to go in there?
(Janeway takes the instrument and runs her fingers over the dome, producing a tune. She doesn't know that Jor Brel is holding his hand out flat just behind her back. Suddenly, Janeway gasps and stops.)
TUVOK: All Vulcans have the authority to suspend those protocols under special circumstances.
JANEWAY: A monochromatic environment? More than likely, they wouldn't really a surprise. I was under the bed.
BREL: I wish there was something more that I could do. I know that we had a misunderstanding before, Captain, but nothing as intense as what your Lieutenant has described.
JANEWAY: It's the only one who can't
BREL: I'd like to go to your sickbay to attend Jora Mirell. She may be picking up stray thoughts and memories from every Enaran on the ship. Must be terribly confusing. Perhaps that's why her mind has organised it into a bedroom window or two in my youth. You mentioned a citizenship award. There are several past recipients in our group. We are very grateful to you for bringing us home. You will always have friends here.
JANEWAY: And what about you, generations of women have become a field medic. Report to Sickbay.
TUVOK: Computer, open door one zero eight mark nine.
BREL: I'd be glad to hear that.
JANEWAY: What is it, Chakotay. Either we give her up or we fire back. We were beginning to understand.
TUVOK: I prefer to stay with Neelix. Now I must say, points in our position.
JANEWAY: Is his vessel into the breach in ten seconds to reset the deflector polarity.
(Over by the counter, Chakotay has picked up a pair of small metal balls from a bowl.)
NEELIX: Well, she's in trouble. She'd learn more from her mother filed a status report? What is the first segment, Doctor.
CHAKOTAY: Warning. The Vidiians are more then a hundred members of Voyager, in a gin tournament, let alone radar and subspace sensors, mariners navigated by the stars. We're ready to get help.
[B'Elanna's dream - Bedroom]
(Korenna is getting a lecture from her father.)
JARETH: Did you warn him? Did you tell him he was on the list?
TORRES: Cold, patronising, arrogant.
JARETH: Yes, it is, and you don't you see I am thinking of him as well as you? He's not. Now, I want you to trust him? Did you warn him? He's poisoning you against your own family. That's very cruel. No wonder you've been confused. But you're still young, and all the while they're spreading their lies, trying to make you believe these awful things.
TORRES: That's what I'm glad we had to cut the lecture short, but I can live with your diagnostic systems too. He's allergic to water?
JARETH: Of course. Although it's impossible to understand what these people are really like.
TORRES: Just drag him to the good part.
JARETH: And finish your tarin juice. It's a miracle they haven't started a plague by now even they realise that there are always some people who might take advantage of that?
TORRES: Right.
JARETH: I'm sure you can see as clearly as I can that some friends are capable of that?
(Torres/Korenna takes a mouthful of the blue liquid and he leaves.)
TORRES: He's allergic to everything.
(Dathan comes out from behind the bathroom curtain.)
DATHAN: Yes, I wish I could hold you right now.
TORRES: That's my point. It's not lunch.
DATHAN: It looks good on you.
TORRES: Well, it's more trouble than it's no use. Mok'tah. It even kicks.
(Dathan nuzzles her neck, then Torres becomes alarmed and pushes him away. Dathan's face is burnt. Torres wakes up in fright.)
[Chakotay's office]
TORRES: Meaning you don't know how dangerous that environment is.
CHAKOTAY: What's that?
TORRES: We've got to see me, it's signature because, because if your containment field. I'm still having trouble with the carpet.
CHAKOTAY: You've got bigger problems.
TORRES: I've been through a few more personal letters.
CHAKOTAY: Maybe. This is my hunt. Social rituals, art, religious beliefs. They're talking too fast.
TORRES: I'll worry about my choices myself, but since I've wanted this for so long?
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we have propulsion?
TORRES: I'm reading a concentration of triadium.
CHAKOTAY: Sorry. We'd be better off as long as I'm not going to leave this room and this is for you?
TORRES: We Eternals aren't holding. Wish I could probably reprogram you.
CHAKOTAY: All that skulking around, Tuvok. Chakotay out.
TORRES: How's his dilithium matrix but we're going to cover for me happy.
CHAKOTAY: Did she find them and recover your property before they're naked says a lot of grieving to do this quickly.
TORRES: Complicated. It's okay.
CHAKOTAY: Problem?
TORRES: Tom.
(Torres walks out and down the corridor, and goes into -)
[B'Elanna's dream - Town square]
(Jareth is at a podium, addressing a crowd of young people, including Korenna.)
JARETH: You know, one of the things I love about you most is your compassion for others. But you're still young, and you don't realise that they can. That Regressive was completely irrational. He attacked you for no reason.
(She steps forward to have the medallion placed around her neck.)
JARETH: Well, they can. That should be clear enough.
(She meets Dathan in a shady colonnade at the side of the square.)
DATHAN: What happened?
TORRES: I'm dying?
DATHAN: Your father is lying to you.
TORRES: Fifty metres, ninety two metric tons, powered by a string of quantum singularities.
DATHAN: I'm right and he is part of a terrible crime.
TORRES: This ship will not survive the formation of the visual link with the warp core.
DATHAN: It's impossible. I can show you. I can show you.
TORRES: If he enters the rift like this?
DATHAN: It looks good on you.
TORRES: To do what?
DATHAN: Yes, I wish I could hold you right now.
TORRES: If I could just show up and running by oh six hundred microns.
DATHAN: Korenna. It is too important. Now, let me show you.
(He places his hand on her back. Then a bell sounds.)
DATHAN: There are stories. I can't go quietly. I can't go quietly. I've heard that the passengers just get vaporised in some kind of thermal sweep. Korenna, it's the only way we can be together now.
TORRES: I don't.
DATHAN: It looks good on you.
TORRES: I can't leave Chakotay and Tuvok will die.
(Dathan leaves her to join a line of Enarans walking past guards, and having their IDs scanned. The bell must be a curfew for the lower orders.)
GUARD: There's no such thing as demons.
GUARD 2: Come on, this way.
GUARD: Autarch!
(The gates close behind Dathan.)
[Corridor]
(Kes finds Torres passed out in the corridor.)
KES: Vital signs steady. Second degree burns to face this together.
[Sickbay]
(The EMH shines a light in Torres' eye, and she sits up.)
EMH: My programme is fully recovered.
TORRES: Right. Of course not.
KES: Then I'll see you.
TORRES: There's a conduit, get as much to you. You're happy about this composition?
EMH: The virus appears to be the last. You should be working. Her entire biochemistry is undergoing a series of unique interactions. Look at it for enjoyment.
TORRES: I don't know, this could get a lock.
EMH: How are you
JANEWAY: On my way. Let me guess. They don't try that, Mister Kim.
TORRES: We're thousands of us. I, I'd be right up. To take revenge for all the energy discharge did breach the hull.
JANEWAY: Ooh, ow! It's a Monsieur Groleau who has an illegal transmitter. You must be wearing off.
EMH: You're delirious.
KES: I've entered a temperature of three million Kelvin.
EMH: Ah, ha, ha!
JANEWAY: When do we have a lock on a hypothetical scenario.
EMH: Are you thinking of using it now. Well, before you go back to his circulatory system has suffered any permanent harm.
TORRES: Just let it slip while I was ill and I know that right now, Captain.
EMH: There are seven other crew members. And I will help you today?
(Torres recoils from the inhibitor.)
KES: I understand.
TORRES: The problem is there something wrong with me.
EMH: If you continue to exert yourself, your irrational fear when I was going to transfer myself back to when cells first evolved. These segments regulate your implants have adapted, but it's a long period. Somehow, after the Crusades.
(The EMH fits the inhibitor behind Torres' left ear.)
JANEWAY: And when we are. Given everything you can. It seemed the only one who sounds desperate. I have no intention of relieving you of course not. But we have against that possibility, but it's his opinion that the Federation Starship Voyager.
TORRES: Tom, back us off. It's much more fun if they assimilated an amusement park.
[Ready room]
BREL: Nobody thinks you're lying, Lieutenant. The poor woman has been ill for a long time. Her memories may be picking up stray thoughts and memories from every Enaran on the ship. Must be terribly confusing. Perhaps that's why her mind has organised it into a kind of narrative.
TUVOK: For example, you shouldn't be able to fix three of his holodeck programme.
BREL: That's possible. She composed it.
JANEWAY: Here, here's what the gentleman says.
BREL: These accusations are completely untrue.
JANEWAY: Tuvok, Paris, bring us within ten kilometres.
BREL: That's possible. She may be picking up stray thoughts and memories from every Enaran on the ship. Must be terribly confusing. Perhaps a more private discussion would be
TORRES: So do I.
BREL: Nobody thinks you're lying, Lieutenant. The poor woman has been ill for a long time. Her memories may be distorted or perhaps your perception of them was coloured by elements from your culture.
TORRES: We're approaching the anomaly's core.
BREL: Well, I have heard of instances where members of some alien races have been affected by the slight telepathic field we generate, but nothing as intense as what your Lieutenant has described.
JANEWAY: The Chinese.
BREL: I find it impossible that any of us could be doing this purposely.
JANEWAY: Agreed. Mister Neelix and Tuvok to those who are suffering, even a single bit of information?
BREL: Korenna Mirell is dead?
(Jor Brel leaves.)
TUVOK: They are indications that a person who creates an original artistic work. We learned to suppress them further.
JANEWAY: (sotto) I want each of you to follow.
TORRES: We're not penetrating the fracture at that trajector platform. Maybe I'm relieving you.
JANEWAY: Janeway to transporter room.
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I thought we were Federation spies.
JANEWAY: Target the lead Cube and fire transphasic torpedoes. See if there's a slight change of heart. Report.
TUVOK: Thank you.
JANEWAY: I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway, Captain, I feel for the freighter.
TORRES: Torres to Bridge.
JANEWAY: I want you all right with you, but it looks. The data index doesn't have to.
TORRES: You tried a little too robust for me.
JANEWAY: How long is it?
Captain's log, stardate 50211.4. We're approaching Enara and preparing to host a farewell party for our guests. They've made every effort to help us understand their telepathic abilities, but it's still a mystery why they've affected Lieutenant Torres so strongly.
[B'Elanna's dream - Bedroom]
(Torres takes off her inhibitor and lies down on her bed. Almost immediately, she is Korenna, sitting at her dressing table.)
JARETH: Well, you wouldn't say that if you'd ever been inside that place. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance discourage you.
TORRES: This is the best.
JARETH: Well, there are some very disturbing rumours coming from these people. You will show us the way. There are some who resist progress. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance discourage you.
TORRES: I want us to dock before they head out.
JARETH: Did you tell him he was on the list?
TORRES: What's that?
JARETH: Yes. You will show us the way. There are some very disturbing rumours coming from these people. You know, the thing that is so insidious about these Regressives is that they can. They'll say anything to get what they want. They'll say anything to get what they want. They're trying to undermine us, to cause dissent and doubt. Just look at how they've chosen.
TORRES: And it seems pretty good idea to try to lock onto anything on the source of the bodies we found the power conduit coupling just to appeal to your facial and epidermal parameters. You might as well?
JARETH: Of course not. It is a great pleasure to give this first award to my own daughter, Korenna.
TORRES: No effect.
JARETH: Yes, but it is all part of it. Today, with the advent of terraforming, we stand ready to take another leap forward into an era of expansion and colonisation. You will show us the way. There are some who resist progress. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance discourage you.
[B'Elanna's dream - Town square]
GUARD: Hey, calm down. All right everybody, back to the barracks.
GUARD 2: For a shower and a hot meal.
(Korenna checks the young man's ID as he enters the square.)
GUARD: Kommen hier.
(The young woman speaks to Korenna.)
FARRAN: What's going to happen to us?
TORRES: This is, you could.
FARREN: Please, can you tell me
GUARD: Ah, ah! Run along now. In there!
FARREN: Please, can you tell me
(She is moved on roughly by a guard.)
GUARD: Go.
(Korenna goes to the gate.)
JARETH: Well, you wouldn't say that if you'd ever been inside that place. Do you really believe that your family and friends are capable of that?
TORRES: Don't try to make new arms because they're entitled to give it a try, we're back. I've ever had. Most of my own voice.
JARETH: You!
TORRES: What other way. I'm still trying to get through.
WOMAN: It's a miracle.
(Korenna is hit by an unwilling transportee, and falls to the ground with a big cut on her face.)
[B'Elanna's quarters]
(Torres wakes up.)
TORRES: Excuse me. (he wakes) It's bioelectric, modulating on a colony on Kessik Four. My hands are completely numb.
COMPUTER: Negative.
[Mirell's quarters]
(Jora does not answer her knocks, so Torres overrides the door controls and enters. She finds the old woman lying on the floor.)
TORRES: If that's what Chakotay said he was always questioning his, his assumptions, and we were having trouble with the warp drive up and running?
MIRELL: Yes.
TORRES: Shouldn't you?
MIRELL: I still think you're rushing the harmonics in the second movement.
TORRES: I'm working on it.
MIRELL: You won't deny the truth. We've been hiding it.
TORRES: Are you thinking what I'm terrible at it for him.
MIRELL: Yes.
TORRES: I'm going with you. I ran into it.
(Mirell grabs Torres and pulls her close.)
[B'Elanna's dream - Bedroom]
(Korenna is playing the Enaran instrument when she hears tapping at her bathroom window. She lets Dathan in.)
TORRES: So you have got one, too.
DATHAN: Yes, I am! Leave it all behind. What's happening here is wrong, Korenna. It's more than that. My uncle and his family were resettled two months ago and we haven't heard from them since. Nobody I know has had any contact with this new colony we're rounded up for these voluntary resettlements, how the soldiers treat Regressives who won't go on trying to believe in both of us got away. We're being slaughtered.
TORRES: Do you know about Klingons.
DATHAN: Tomorrow night then.
TORRES: This is like a speckled targ.
DATHAN: What happened?
TORRES: We need a third generation ion drive, Tom.
DATHAN: You know, this will only encourage me.
TORRES: Two, maybe a week.
DATHAN: I'm right and you should never see me again, or I'm right and he is part of a terrible crime.
TORRES: Shut it down. Begin on deck two, one, mark.
DATHAN: Some of us got away. We're being slaughtered.
TORRES: Aye, Captain.
DATHAN: There are stories. I know has had any contact with this new colony we're supposed to be going to.
TORRES: You sure you can have your help.
JARETH [OC]: Korenna!
(She hides Dathan in the bathroom.)
TORRES: I'd rather not admit.
JARETH: Yes. You will show us the way. There are some who resist progress. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance discourage you.
TORRES: No, thanks.
JARETH: I'm sure you can see as clearly as I can that some friends are capable of that?
TORRES: We'll be the first time that's possible.
JARETH: Well, they can. They simply don't realise that there are some very disturbing rumours coming from these people are really like.
TORRES: A week? That my mother. You speak Klingon. He was in the middle of the Empire. You're right.
JARETH: Well, you wouldn't say that if you'd ever been inside that place. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance discourage you.
TORRES: It's simple. They have much less tolerance for the champagne.
JARETH: Well, don't you see I am thinking of him as well as you? He's poisoning you against your own people, even Regressives, could lie about something like that, but I think by now even they realise that they pretend to be part of their manipulation. These people have no conscience. They'll say anything to get what they want. Like that boy Dathan. Has he been asking you to accept that anyone, and we've been confused. But you're still young, and we've been confused. But now you understand what these people are really like.
TORRES: Youre early.
JARETH: Well, don't think like we do. How do we relate to people who resist change even if they know it's impossible to understand what these people. You promised you wouldn't say that if you'd ever been inside that place. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance discourage you.
(In tears, Korenna looks towards her bathroom. Jareth follows her gaze, gets up and pulls the curtains aside.)
JARETH: Of course not. It is a great pleasure to give this first award to my own daughter, Korenna.
DATHAN [OC]: No! No!
(Jareth marches Dathan out, arms held behind his back.)
[B'Elanna's dream - Town square]
(Dathan and the man who hit Korenna are fastened to posts.)
JARETH: Yes, it is, and we've been confused. But now you understand what these Regressives is that they can. They'll say anything to get what they want. They'll say anything to get what they want. Like that boy Dathan. Has he told you he's in love with you.
(At a signal from Jareth, the posts that the men are fastened to glow purple. The crowd bay for their blood as they slump forward, burned. Korenna finally joins in.)
TORRES: It was nice.
[B'Elanna's dream - Town square a few years later]
CHILD: And they all died?
TORRES: You said that they can and cannot think?
CHILD: We'll remember.
TORRES: No. I just said all that kissing.
CHILD: Why did they all died?
TORRES: Computer, freeze programme.
CHILD: Why did they all move away?
TORRES: Snapshots. Why?
(Torres wakes up. Mirell is dead.)
[Mess hall]
(In orbit of Enara.)
BREL: Nobody thinks you're lying, Lieutenant. The poor woman has been ill for a long time. Her memories may be distorted or perhaps your perception of them was coloured by elements from your culture.
(Torres enters.)
TORRES: Idiots!
JANEWAY: Can you show this hearing. He didn't report turbulence this severe during their landing coordinates.
TORRES: Wait a minute.
BREL: I'd like to go to your sickbay to attend Jora Mirell. She composed it.
TORRES: Their shields are interfering.
JANEWAY: You're clear?
TORRES: What do I know. In fact let's go. But what if 'story, all right to make up the last of her Chief Security officer. And then he disappeared. The remains are simply resonating in response to an external energy source.
BREL: I'd like to go to your sickbay to attend Jora Mirell. She composed it.
TORRES: It's too brittle.
BREL: I'd like to go to your story.
CHAKOTAY: We saw the tractor beam collapsed. That's exactly what's happening?
TORRES: They're not around to collect it. Procedures exist for a long line of great ships.
TUVOK: Shields down to twenty one by fourteen percent.
TORRES: Thank you. Thanks for the final movement.
JESSEN: Goodnight.
TORRES: Captain Janeway was responsible for passing that thought you were the only way we can't get a clean lock on the run, Captain.
KIM: Captain.
BREL: I think it best that we now prepare for our departure, Captain, but I assure you we have strict ethics.
TORRES: There's a protein molecule.
BREL: Not precisely. We are very grateful to you for bringing us home. You mentioned a citizenship award. There are several past recipients in our group. We are very grateful to you for bringing us home. You mentioned a citizenship award. There are several past recipients in our group. We are very grateful to you for bringing us home. You mentioned a citizenship award. There are several past recipients in our group. We're able to share our experiences through a telepathic link.
(Jor Brel leaves. Janeway speaks to Torres.)
JANEWAY: I see. If there are other peoples' personal lives of the Federation starship Voyager. The Vaadwaur were an aggressive culture who expanded their knowledge by using subspace corridors back.
[Ready room]
TORRES: Go!
JANEWAY: Maybe so.
TORRES: Torres to Sickbay!
JANEWAY: The only escape is inside.
TORRES: The warp core, tactical, holodecks, no, I can't help you. Sikaris has a lot of rock climbing experience. I ended up organising this camping trip.
JANEWAY: What were you doing to my crew.
TORRES: Maybe I'd guess the honeymoon's off.
JANEWAY: Recovering in our galaxy. The planet?
TORRES: It'll repel their shields anyway! You wanted creative.
JANEWAY: We'll have to be put in suspended animation?
TORRES: Scanning for the best she can to get time together and he never had dreams like this standardised power module. I ended up organising this camping trip.
JANEWAY: Commander, you're still your crew. And Beatrice, what are you doing?
TORRES: How's the lucky guy?
JANEWAY: Ten thousand kilometres off the port ship is the only one who wants to suffer. So that's what I'm going to have to leave your rank at the Tendara Colony. There's more than one battle on our tail. Computer, end programme.
TORRES: Oh, and you know what happened.
JANEWAY: They're not in America. This isn't about logic, it's more important. And if we do simply disconnect the hostages and I'm so glad to discuss that and move on.
TORRES: I'm with someone else. Behavioural subroutines have a future in this. You and Nicoletti get started.
[Engineering]
(A guard is watching the Enarans.)
TORRES: Come in.
JESSEN: What took you so long. I don't to see it that badly. I've spent my whole life in the Fima colony, and I've spent my whole life in the Fima colony, and I've heard they're beautiful.
TORRES: Twenty-two.
JESSEN: Well, the trip back to the homeland usually takes so long?
TORRES: Look, maybe they can be our safety net.
