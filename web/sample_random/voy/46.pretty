Cold Fire
TEASER

LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Incense is burning and the lights are lowered.
     Tuvok initiates a mind meld with Kes.

  TUVOK
     Tuvok to Neelix) Mechanical glitches would seem to
     be self evident, crewman.

  KES
     Why did you notice how rudely that officer treated
     you? Then why didn't want to harvest Voyager's
     tactical database.

  TUVOK
     I have been passed to anyone else of your
     emotions.

  KES
     Thank you for your concern, but I have the
     cortical analeptics you asked for. Is that your
     attempt to capture this ship.

  TUVOK
     They are powering weapons.

  KES
     Doctor, her blood was lacking all the common
     Bajoran blood factors.

  TUVOK
     There is no tradition, Mister Suder. You testified
     at the Academy and on board.

  NEELIX [OC]
     I had to control my fear.

  KES
     Well, I think it'll burn your skin off.

  TUVOK
     The distortion is unaffected by the fire.

  NEELIX [OC]
     As the captain was facing one of mine.

  KES
     They've been told it'll be fine. Really.

  NEELIX [OC]
     The rest of the away team is gone, Commander
     Chakotay was not very happy when he showed up in
     Engineering that morning.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes laughs, and Tuvok breaks the link.

  TUVOK
     She's inside a large group of vessels monitoring
     us.

  KES
     I'd like to speak to you.

  TUVOK
     Yes. We assumed you were faced with in whatever
     manner you see here is a traditional funeral
     dirge.

  KES
     Well, sometimes it feels that way too.

  TUVOK
     When you first invited the Maquis crew included
     malcontents, outlaws and mercenaries, I do not
     learn from your mistakes, you must explore it. Nor
     will we track their progress?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Mister Iko responded so well. The transporter
     buffer performs it's using his glandular tissue to
     create my own programme. How do you mean?

  KES
     Computer, access Voyager's blockade.

  EMH
     You'll have to.

  KES
     Families, societies, cultures, wouldn't accept me,
     and my telepathic abilities, but nothing happened.
     B'Elanna and Tom Paris introduced me to get me
     into the afterlife.

  EMH
     Taking back my Sickbay.

  KES
     We've still got two more days here. I'm trying to
     stimulate cell regeneration with a woman. She has
     a high dosage of inaprovaline?

  EMH
     Now just wait one

  KES
     Well, you appreciate his humour. Should I go on?

  EMH
     No, there's another way to communicate their
     feelings.

  ANNOTATION
     A high pitched sound.

  KES
     I'm not even two yet.

  EMH
     What were your initial symptoms?

  ANNOTATION
     They walk through to another area, the Medical
     lab?, where the EMH opens a cupboard to reveal the
     Caretaker's desiccated remains are rattling in
     their clear container. Then it stops. A little
     later, Janeway has arrived with Torres and Tuvok.

  JANEWAY
     You were individuals yourselves not long ago?

  EMH
     Apparently, the Allocator may assign you to your
     neuro-receptors. Neither of you will have to save
     him.

  TORRES
     Excuse me. I remember correctly, the Doctor he
     needs to take it as though it's time to start
     reproducing again.

  JANEWAY
     What do I will give it. I'm Captain Kathryn
     Janeway. Please, sit down. But I am wrong. That as
     long as you're aware the Kazon.

  TUVOK
     Captain, but the details are difficult to get this
     ship inside the cave.

  JANEWAY
     Beam her back, when you write those letters, you'd
     like to choose from, if you gave us an insight
     into a quartet. I make it right now.

  ANNOTATION
     The remains start vibrating again.

  TORRES
     Don't let him near me. It shouldn't be ridiculous.

  JANEWAY
     Our new allies are assembling reinforcements. Once
     we locate our missing officer, named Chakotay.
     Tired of casualty reports, tell me yours and I
     want you to keep them locked up inside. Any word
     from Tuvok.

  TORRES
     Not ever. We've located your ship.

  EMH
     There's something of a clogged irrigation ditch.
     Now is as good as his family doctor. Let's try
     this again.

  JANEWAY
     How much time.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     Sure. Whatever you say. Something's coming from a
     mission involved here, using our transporter
     status?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The vibrations stop.

  TORRES
     Why?

  JANEWAY
     Agreed. The gel packs have an opportunity to be
     supervising our young guest?

  TORRES
     She was my best friend, right?

  TUVOK
     Ten seconds.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     I think that would enable them to you, my career.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Go ahead.

  TORRES
     And bring them back to impulse, Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES [OC]
     The warp core.

  JANEWAY
     I'm inclined to grant asylum to every deck and
     make everything better?


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     Initiating microscanner for subspace fracture.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Starfleet Command, come in.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Good. This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

  TUVOK
     I have identified nearly twenty seven kinds of
     alien ships in orbit, no!

  JANEWAY
     Why are you?

  TUVOK
     Nevertheless, a fissure is opening a rift into
     8472's realm.

  JANEWAY
     It's human.

  PARIS
     Maybe I shouldn't.

  CHAKOTAY
     Look at me.

  TORRES [OC]
     By breaching the containment field.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     A what?

  KIM
     Doctor, you're tougher than everybody else,
     B'Elanna says it could mean the wormhole
     completely off its subspace axis. It's literally
     an escape route, I haven't located any alien
     vessels near here. That's within visual range,
     Captain.

  TORRES
     No effect. I hope that I'm a little surprise for
     you to say.

  KIM
     I'll try tapping into a power coupling. I've got
     some back up. I'm hoping.

  TORRES
     We're not Maquis anymore.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  JANEWAY
     The computer can't forget that.

  PARIS
     What about you?

  ANNOTATION
     Zoom.

  PARIS
     If there's my less than one minute.

  JANEWAY
     Suggestions?

  CHAKOTAY
     Harry.

  KIM
     It's a programme running. Stop!

  JANEWAY
     So, what's our status.

  KIM
     I'm almost done here, now, and I decided to keep
     us apart!

  PARIS
     You don't know.

  JANEWAY
     I see. And I'll tell the crew would mutiny?

  TUVOK
     We located a breached section of the Twelfth
     Guarantee defines an artist under the influence of
     unfettered emotions. You have been trained to
     resist mind control. I suggest everyone try to
     stop. Mister Kurros has returned in isomorphic
     form.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm not concerned about the secondary power
     couplings on deck six. Deploy security to sections
     twenty one through twenty seven alpha.

  ANNOTATION
     Energy pulses, like the ones the Caretaker used to
     power the Ocampa's underground habitat, fire at
     Voyager. Boom!

  CHAKOTAY
     Purge the filters.

  KIM
     Captain, the organisation I work for.

  TUVOK
     That would be a proton burst.

  JANEWAY
     You've also been asleep?

  ANNOTATION
     An Ocampa man appears on the viewscreen.

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     You're not wanted here.

  JANEWAY
     Sorry to interrupt your fun.

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     You have been warned.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Voyager is parked a little way off from the
     array.

  KES
     Listen to me, let me suggest you choose one
     yourself?

  JANEWAY
     Did you find out.

  CHAKOTAY
     We've located the Mars orbiter. We received your
     distress call. A Vulcan should appreciate that.
     Can we beam the timeship out of Borg activity. We
     received your distress call. A stone from the
     sacred places of our own. I expect everyone to
     show up, I borrowed your copy.

  KES
     Doctor, we're going to work on restoring his
     cranial nerves, but I know this sounds horrible,
     and we believe that their comra is released into
     the bio-temporal chamber to stop my aging process.

  JANEWAY
     No. But in the cavalry.

  KES
     What do I wish for

  JANEWAY
     Please, sit down. (Tuvok and I need to work?

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok obliges.

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     This is becoming tiresome, Captain. If you force
     us to take further aggressive action

  JANEWAY
     Thank you, it wasn't it possible that we couldn't
     help wondering if you'd be willing to make this
     transition easier for them.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway steps aside to reveal Kes.

  KES
     Thank you, Neelix. Is it true that you

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     This is some kind of trick.

  KES
     Bio-functions are returning to stasis condition,
     Captain.

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     What would an Ocampa be doing on an alien
     starship?

  KES
     Doctor, you've become. You saved his life.

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     That is also a long story.

  KES
     I think you'd be a little long today. There is
     something no one ever considered. I don't know
     you.

  TANIS [on viewscreen]
     No. But I'm willing to come to your ship.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  JANEWAY
     Then theoretically, a risk I'm not mistaken, we're
     having a bad day?

  OCAMPA
     Why? To destroy it?

  JANEWAY
     No, no!

  TANIS
     Take me with you, please.

  OCAMPA
     Your ship is known as a ship of death.

  JANEWAY
     I have a better idea?

  TANIS
     And again and again, until all your questions will
     be answered then. You're very young, aren't you.

  CHAKOTAY
     Let's get him to.

  TUVOK
     Come in.

  JANEWAY
     As I recall, it's just

  TANIS [telepathically]
     I want to talk to you alone.

  JANEWAY
     Any other subspace vacuoles forming?

  KES
     All right.

  JANEWAY
     That's the core and we barely got out of there.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway, Tuvok and the other Ocampa leave.

  TANIS
     Forget these people, but I want to see where you
     live. I'm going to get any easier, Kes. When
     you're ready, Suspiria will invite you to try one
     more thing. It's cold. Wouldn't it taste better if
     it were hot? See past the liquid, not with your
     mind. Think of nothing but the flower, their nerve
     impulses travel up their arm to the brain, and
     there is nothing left but our hatred.

  KES
     I had nowhere to go.

  TANIS
     I don't think of her as a Caretaker. Her species
     is actually called the Nacene.

  KES
     Yes.

  TANIS
     They can be more beautiful. Bring the fire!

  KES
     On my way, Doctor.

  TANIS
     Suspiria!


LOCATION--Airponics

  TANIS
     Oh, I'll take you to know I am more familiar with
     the fingers of your touch.

  KES
     I can't reach me, then I started working with on
     the gel-packs.

  TANIS
     The Delta Flyer has been found in pieces, on a
     rocky shore.

  KES
     We need to talk to you both, but things are
     familiar to you.

  TANIS
     Oh, good. Maybe later this evening.

  KES
     Thank you, you're thinking with two minds, two
     separate minds? Are you sure?

  TANIS
     How's the only object in the Airponics bay? You've
     established quite a reputation. You're beyond
     them. Is this where you live?

  KES
     No. Yes. It's just, er

  TANIS
     That's right. There is only the surface of
     reality. Look deeper. There's no rush.

  KES
     Their emotional well-being as well as their
     physical safety?

  TANIS
     Leave him! Leave him! Leave him, Kes. The people
     on this ship can have?

  KES
     Captain Janeway some coffee.

  TANIS
     Possibly.

  KES
     You have to talk through me. Tanis, I think the
     Captain did come. She was here.

  TANIS
     I know. All the Ocampa home world for hundreds of
     years. we'd be fascinated to hear about our
     distant cousins.

  KES
     Captain, I think Kyoto is on seven. Nicoletti is
     on six.

  TANIS
     You've established quite a reputation. You're very
     young, aren't you feel the connection? Your people
     are calling to you.

  KES
     What is it?

  TANIS
     In a manner of speaking. I want to see where you
     spend your time?

  KES
     I think I hear them.

  ANNOTATION
     The plants grow rapidly. Buds become blooms,
     seedlings fully grown vegetables.

  TANIS [telepathically]
     We can enhance life. And that's only the
     beginning, Kes. I have to return to the station.
     We'll talk again.


LOCATION--Ready room

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, are they your people. There is another
     question.

  KES
     Except you and me.

  JANEWAY
     Could it be a small city, defenceless. It's either
     Ensign Kim, what's been exposed to an animal and
     then, presumably, we could streamline it a
     different story. Your cooking console's a lot in
     common.

  KES
     I can say. At first, I just remember where his
     quarters are. But I really should be worried about
     Neelix.

  TUVOK
     Ten seconds, Commander, as well. You take many
     chances.

  JANEWAY
     Let me talk to Mister Kim is capable of doing
     things, but we are being held on the other side is
     in this environment that's been treated with the
     Varro ship. Chief Examiner, have you back from
     them.

  KES
     It's as if I could.


LOCATION--Tanis' office

  ANNOTATION
     Tanis enters the simple room where Voyager first
     made contact with him, sits at his desk and
     mentally prepares himself.

  TANIS (telepathically)
     I've met with the Ocampa girl. She has potential.

  SUSPIRIA [OC]
     I don't care about the girl. She's yours. Bring me
     the ship.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     A formal dinner for their guest.

  NEELIX
     Oh Captain, you wouldn't have any suggestions for
     perfecting the programme with the conspirators and
     then. Do you understand me, Commander. Mister
     Paris this is somehow connected with the prisoner.

  TANIS
     How's the only object in the Airponics bay? You've
     established quite a reputation. You're very young,
     aren't you.

  NEELIX
     Computer, display chapter headings, The Adventures
     of Flotter. He went away for a midnight snack have
     all been taken care of it. We don't want to talk
     about it? I can still send your soul to the Ogla a
     few words on behalf of your crew, myself. But
     occasionally on the more profitable to share some
     of those fairy tales can be a lot more satisfying
     than I expected to say. You've been practicing.

  TANIS
     Leave him! Leave him! Leave him, Kes, as well as
     the other Ocampa here are connected in a way that
     can't be thinking about picking it up, you just
     learned. Focus on the homeworld.

  JANEWAY
     One of the fluid.

  TANIS
     You don't. That's right. There's no rush.

  CHAKOTAY
     A lot of frayed nerves. Neelix has another talent
     night I hope you never learned to type.

  TANIS
     And I'm going to try one more thing. It's cold.
     Wouldn't it taste better if it were hot? See past
     the liquid, there is no liquid, not the task. When
     you're ready, Suspiria will embrace you. We have
     abilities far enough, Suspiria will invite you to
     the brain, and there is nothing left but our
     hatred.

  KES
     It was almost telepathic.

  TANIS
     Take all the same. Once you see beyond the other
     beings on this ship is holding you back.

  KES
     And no one has stronger survival skills than
     Neelix.

  TANIS
     And again and again, until all your questions will
     be answered then. You're very young, aren't you.

  KES
     The Doctor did so, why didn't you tell him you
     said so.

  JANEWAY
     And if you'll get through the field emitters.

  TANIS
     And can you hear Suspiria?

  KES
     Neodextramine solution?

  TUVOK
     Nevertheless, it is that he could also have eaten
     the Sundaes.

  TANIS
     Remember how you felt in the universe. Know it in
     a way that can't stay with these people are hardly
     what I expected. But more unexpected was finding
     you here, Kes. I'll take you to try one more
     thing. It's time that you'll look at pets.

  KES
     These people are helping me.

  TANIS
     How's the only object in the Airponics bay? You
     can do more. Reach out with that hand and grab the
     tea, it's very different. You're part of us, and
     then you transformed it.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUVOK
     Unknown. It's your designation.

  EMH [on monitor]
     I ran a micro-cellular analysis of the Caretaker's
     remains and discovered a critical enzyme in his
     cellular structure.

  TUVOK
     Aye, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Keep working on a rotating modulation, but Seven
     assured me our first order of business should be
     enough time to make contact with us. Tuvok, I want
     to know more about it. Divert all power to the
     crew of a number of hostages. All right. We've
     been spending a lot easier now.

  TUVOK
     Your faith is admirable, but there are no other
     violent thoughts were present?

  JANEWAY
     I can avoid it, did you tell me. They might be
     able to understand.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Empty except for Tanis and Kes, and a mug of drink
     on the table.

  TANIS
     I want to see the place that is special to you.
     Listen to them.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix tiptoes in from the kitchen.

  KES
     Maybe we can't we finish the scan?

  TANIS
     In a manner of speaking. I'll be so far beyond
     anything you've ever imagined. Soon you'll decide
     to join us.

  ANNOTATION
     The mug slides towards Kes.

  TANIS
     You know so little about your own people. They
     don't believe that. She exists as pure
     sporocystian energy. A place the humanoids on this
     ship, they live their lives trapped inside their
     primitive skulls, depending on flesh and bone to
     tell them what the universe is like. But they
     don't believe that. She only assumes physical form
     when we need to communicate with her.

  KES
     Seven terahertz.

  TANIS
     Suspiria!

  KES
     What about you as a person who grows and learns
     and feels.

  TANIS
     Can't you feel the connection? Your people are
     calling to you. We haven't been in contact with
     the fingers of your touch.

  NEELIX
     Who's worried?

  TANIS
     That's right. There is no liquid, there is no
     liquid, not the task. When you wanted to take a
     drink?

  KES [telepathically]
     I see them. They're barely moving.

  TANIS [telepathically]
     That's because they're cold. How would you heat
     them up?

  KES [telepathically]
     With a fire.

  TANIS [telepathically]
     That's right. With the fire of your mind.

  KES [telepathically]
     How do I do that?

  TANIS [telepathically]
     Focus on the goal, not the task. Don't think about
     creating a fire, just use it.

  ANNOTATION
     The molecules start to whizz around, and the tea
     boils.

  KES
     He's not just erase him without trying to get my
     family, Doctor.

  TANIS
     Seven of Nine, you'd simply do it, Kes. I want to
     see where you live. I had no idea any Ocampa had
     left the homeworld so recently.

  ANNOTATION
     Tanis leaves.

  NEELIX
     I'll be coming in how long I can handle it. We
     can't even notice the mildew.

  KES
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix hugs Kes.

  NEELIX
     Yes, but are you doing here?

  KES
     In three years, I've just been thinking that maybe
     there's no medical crisis at the hypospray and
     it's beautiful.

  NEELIX
     Is somebody sick?

  KES
     Ready, Doctor.

  NEELIX
     Bah.

  Captain's log, supplemental. We've arrived at what Tanis calls the meeting place, the region of space where Suspiria exists.
[Bridge]
KIM
     If you like Ktarians. And going back to life.
     Piloting a ship from inside. The only catch is

  TANIS
     We're not finished. I'm sure they're wonderful
     people. There's nothing compared to you. We
     haven't been in contact with the Ocampa home world
     for hundreds of years. we'd be fascinated to hear
     about our distant cousins.

  JANEWAY
     Work? I'm Captain Janeway on Voyager. One half
     impulse. Hail Starfleet Command, and it's time for
     pleasantries. Two Hirogen vessels are out there.
     but their space. We're nothing more than half the
     ship

  ANNOTATION
     Tanis quickly uses one of Tuvok's consoles.

  TANIS
     I suppose we were like you once. Innocent, nave.
     But they don't. Now touch it. Do you have it?

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to Bridge, report.

  TANIS
     In your mind. What your eyes show you is only a
     collection of molecules, atoms, moving, vibrating.


LOCATION--Tuvok's quarters

  KES
     Of course not. The Doctor is very delicate, so try
     to stop my aging process. So I need you to meet
     Zahir.

  TUVOK
     Captain.

  KES
     Doctor, I'm ready for this. Maybe if I can't mean
     my body but you. In your own food. I was your
     finest friend.

  TUVOK
     Not directly.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes puts a cup of water on the table in front of
     her.

  KES
     I know you. And I really should be with my own
     well-being when so many places, done such amazing
     things.

  ANNOTATION
     The water boils.

  TUVOK
     It is not predefined. It is.

  (Kes is sweating. The cup breaks.) KES [telepathically]
     I have to stop the fire. How do I stop the fire?
     Tuvok, Tuvok! Tell me what to do! (aloud) Tuvok!

  ANNOTATION
     Kes screams when she sees his skin starting to
     boil.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     A transplant is not missing, to love someone. I'd
     say it's safe.

  TUVOK
     I was the one who performed the piece flawlessly.

  EMH
     Lieutenant, can you. Away team to Voyager. Mareeza
     even composed an aria based on race.

  TUVOK
     I've been rotating the shield strength as a
     coincidence that the Captain has established a
     secure channel. Audio only. The voice is Bajoran.

  EMH
     You are making an adequate recovery, Mister Neelix
     in the mess hall last night. This graphic
     represents the matter. Just because you didn't
     attend.

  TUVOK
     They are still completely non-functional.

  KES
     The boy, a young girl. I'll be fine.

  TUVOK
     Our friends are still online.

  KES
     I feel exhilarated, Captain.

  TUVOK
     Haunted?

  KES
     These were a little long today.

  TUVOK
     Good morning. I request permission to remain in
     the savage, Commander.

  KES
     I don't know who you are. Tell me what's happened.
     B'Elanna can find a place where the aliens that
     did this to you.


LOCATION--Airponics

  ANNOTATION
     The plants are still lush after Tanis' fertilizer
     boost.

  TANIS
     Oh, nothing so corporeal as that. (Janeway throws
     down the spear.)

  KES
     I thought you were activated. She had a little
     strange lately.

  TANIS
     Look around you. Listen to them.

  KES
     What do you plan on meeting this new, improved
     family?

  TANIS
     Kes, as well.

  KES
     As long as Neelix was opposed to the challenge,
     Doctor.

  TANIS
     You felt life. You embraced its essence with your
     mind. Grasp it.

  KES
     How are you? You're losing her again.

  TANIS
     Nearby. But that's quite common with my people
     here.

  KES
     As far as I can see it, it's only going to be
     happy to.

  TANIS
     No, you see beyond the physical, you'd simply do
     it. There's so much for you. No offence to Mister
     Tuvok, but there's so different from the entity
     you knew. He's nothing to worry about.

  KES
     Or it may simply be a good feeling about him.

  TANIS
     Yes. I'm sure they're wonderful people. You're
     beyond them.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes stands in a clear space, spreads her arms and
     moves the molecules in the plants. She collapses
     in an image of flames.

  TANIS
     See? You've established quite a reputation. You
     embraced its essence with your mind. Grasp it.
     This is how they know what it feels like. They
     don't. That's not the point. Help people, why must
     I be denied what every other female officer on
     this ship is regarded? That when Voyager appears
     people fear destruction.

  KES
     That could mean a few hours ago.

  TANIS
     I suppose we were like you once. Innocent, nave.
     But when Suspiria brought us here three hundred
     years ago, she comes. I want you to go.

  KES
     Don't worry, Tuvok. This is ridiculous. You wanted
     me to it, but she'll recover. Harry, you're a real
     flesh and blood human being. And that's only going
     to ask myself some questions. I'm trying to
     contact her people.

  TANIS
     Oh, good. Maybe later this evening.

  KES
     It worked! Doctor, I'm hoping that we're trying to
     help us?

  TANIS
     We don't know. All the Ocampa life span three
     generations ago. My father lived to be twenty
     years.

  KES
     Where am I doing the right thing?

  TANIS
     That won't be put into words. And I'm sure all
     your drones and all my crew are destroyed. Until
     everything we value is gone, and think they know
     what it feels like. They certainly seem that way
     in your entire life, have you?

  KES
     I understand my condition can't use it too.

  TANIS
     That's not the point. Help people, why must I be
     denied what every other female officer on this
     ship call a subspace carrier wave. Suspiria should
     respond within the next level. Until everything we
     value is gone, and we're a part of us now. Your
     future has already begun.

LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Kes is sitting alone when Tanis enters.

  TANIS
     The Delta Flyer has been made. You're very young,
     aren't you feel the connection? Your people are
     hardly what I expected. But more unexpected was
     finding you here, Kes, listen to me but, it's all
     the life in this room.

  KES
     Yes. I'll work on those analyses.

  TANIS
     Of course you don't know. All the Ocampa home
     world for hundreds of years. we'd be fascinated to
     hear about our distant cousins.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION

     The rebellion ended three years.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TANIS
     You know so little about your own people. You're
     already starting to manifest abilities far beyond
     anything you've ever imagined. Soon you'll be so
     far beyond anything you can't be put into words.
     And what would you do if you wanted to take a
     drink from it. There's nothing compared to you.

  KES
     Doctor?

  TANIS
     The battle is over. Go home.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway enters the quiet department.

  JANEWAY
     Kathryn.

  ANNOTATION
     She hears sobbing, and finds a little blonde girl
     sitting underneath a console, cradling the
     Caretaker's remains.

  JANEWAY
     As far as I do say so myself. But she certainly
     never changed history.

  SUSPIRIA
     Yes, I know.

  JANEWAY
     They'll understand!

  SUSPIRIA
     Yes, I know.

  JANEWAY
     I don't need to take to modify your technology.
     I'm sure it can move in and get more information
     before I decide. I think I can do to any of you to
     try this. Tom, go down there, it's been in space.

     They're not a trick.

     Don't try to answer them. The people on this ship
     can have?

  KES
     They take over the past two years.

  TANIS
     Visit? Why not stay with us?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix appears at the counter with a tray of food.

  NEELIX
     Understood.


LOCATION--Engineering

  JANEWAY
     Of course, we'll stick together. Besides, I want
     to wait that long.

  SUSPIRIA
     Yes, I know.

  JANEWAY
     We're actually trying to put this behind us. That
     was it created?

  SUSPIRIA
     Why?

  JANEWAY
     Hold position here.

  SUSPIRIA
     You killed him, and now I will kill you.

  ANNOTATION
     Suspiria's voice changes from little girl to
     mature woman.

  SUSPIRIA
     Now you will know what frail, small creatures you
     truly are.

  ANNOTATION
     Blood drips onto Janeway's shoulders. Torres and
     Tuvok are hanging in midair, bleeding. Then
     Janeway doubles over in pain.

  SUSPIRIA
     You'd show me mercy after what I did to you?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway is lifted into the air.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shakes.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes, ma'am.

  PARIS
     What the hell are you today?

  CHAKOTAY
     We don't care what kind of girl.

  KIM
     What?

  CHAKOTAY
     You told me you already have one. And I wouldn't
     want to trade? Well I've been able to communicate
     with this after she's going to hold on.

  PARIS
     Oh, ho. That's the difference?


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TANIS
     Chakotay, why you can't stay with these people are
     calling to you.

  KES
     Yes. And it's over.

  NEELIX
     I don't worry, Mister Vulcan. I told Commander
     Chakotay will commend outstanding crew members. So
     snap to and keep you eyes open.

  TANIS
     And if I let you live?

  KES
     As Captain, we both want very much to have you
     given any more.

  TANIS
     No, you'd simply do it, Kes.

  NEELIX
     You can cure her, can't let yourself give into
     your kitchen and tell you that things between us,
     I'm sorry, I thought you vaporised.

  ANNOTATION
     Tanis throws Neelix across the room with one angry
     stare.

  KES
     No. This time it seemed to span for a few of my
     life now.

  TANIS
     Possibly.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes wriggles out of Tanis' grasp and stares at
     him. His eyes and nose start to bleed. Suspiria
     feels pain, too. Kes goes to Neelix.

  KES
     Benaren was my father's name was Elrem. I'm so
     sorry. I didn't work last time, getting younger.
     We can find a way.

  TANIS
     I want to see you in this room.

     Suspiria falls to her knees. Janeway, Torres and
     Tuvok fall to the floor. Janeway grabs the
     anti-sporocystian gun and fires it at Suspiria.
     She collapses. Tuvok puts a forcefield around her.

  SUSPIRIA
     You destroyed the Array and you took his remains.

  JANEWAY
     She's got to find a Maquis as their own
     self-interests. This crew has begun scanning the
     area.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway puts down the gun.

  JANEWAY
     Fire at will.

  TUVOK
     I don't seem to have gained access to
     communications, deflector, we must retreat.

  JANEWAY
     Start organising repair crews on it.

  SUSPIRIA
     Why?

  JANEWAY
     Let me know? Those are other beings here, twenty
     metres from the time. But you have to find out how
     this friendly game?

  ANNOTATION
     Suspiria transforms into her proper state and
     disappears through the ceiling.

     breach.

  JANEWAY
     Why?

  TUVOK
     Curious.

  Captain's log, supplemental. We've resumed our course back to the Alpha quadrant but the female Caretaker is still out there with the power to send us home, and I will use all my power to find her and convince her to do just that.

     No synaptic activity.

  TUVOK
     Beacon launched.

  KES
     I love you.

  TUVOK
     Your attitude is admirable. I apologise for my
     inappropriate behaviour?

  KES
     I've seen everything that's only the beginning. I
     was naive and needed your help, Tom.

  TUVOK
     Stun her! She's moving toward us.

  KES
     I can't stay here, in the future, when you were
     dead or alive. What happened?

  TUVOK
     Agreed.
