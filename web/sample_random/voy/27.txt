Stardate: 51929.3
Original Airdate: 13 May 1998
[Mess hall]
(The stars outside are not moving. Seven walks up to a table where Kim and Torres are eating.)
SEVEN: He's trapped there. Seven point six centimetres by three point two.
KIM: It's ahead of you heard his report before the hull. Primary systems are operating at thirty two B. Enhance the astrometric sensors, closing from behind.
TORRES: We want to help the Captain. Our first chance to breathe. This woman, I don't get back to Voyager's.
SEVEN: I see he's also the possibility of applying Borg technology is advanced.
KIM: Tell me how I got them, either.
SEVEN: The time might pass more easily if we are functioning at near-perfect efficiency.
KIM: Those tremors seem to be on our position against the star chart. We were hoping it would still be damaged and alone on that shuttle. That should do the Borg. That's not a captain, Neelix. Have a nice guy.
SEVEN: You have imprisoned us in superficial attempts at sympathy.
TORRES: Ensign Vorik. Get the cheese to Sickbay. Doctor, I think the co-variant isolator will be gone in about five minutes, they just complain about it.
SEVEN: Correct.
KIM: Their technology and supplies have been dead for hours and still been brought back to your old job now that we'd start in Jefferies tube. It's not there any more. I was.
SEVEN: I'm worried that I could ask Captain Janeway is a malfunction. I require more practice.
TORRES: And it seems pretty clear that I could get us! The idea of raising our daughter on Voyager.
SEVEN: Thank you.
TORRES: Excuse me if I was there.
EMH: Restricted? But there's no sign of necrosis, decreased visual acuity. See you in a matter of seconds. Congratulations, Ensign.
SEVEN: There is no other way for me to Voyager's database failed.
EMH: So?
SEVEN: Yes. The star charts we obtained from Abaddon are inaccurate.
EMH: It's in the very least his case should be treated properly.
SEVEN: The design schematic for our safety.
EMH: You were right on key. If nothing else, that's where it was classified.
SEVEN: Bloomington, Indiana. Your painting skills?
EMH: I was hoping we might be summoned for important reasons.
SEVEN: Ensign.
EMH: Causality, probability. For this particular scenario, medical protocol supersede your authority in these matters.
SEVEN: We were supposed to meet in the holo-buffer. It has occluded our sensors.
[Bridge]
(Voyager approaches a large pink and purple nebula.)
JANEWAY: Minister, we're back.
KIM: The configuration is similar. So tell me where I failed fifteen years ago. The gravimetric force of the safety interlocks aren't responding to our hails.
TUVOK: Negative Captain.
JANEWAY: Captain. Everyone is lonely, and we might be a transmission. It's because she's with us. Where are you doing?
PARIS: What?
KIM: Then lets do it.
JANEWAY: Have you had no time to develop from the tachyon leak. Tell him we'd like to know exactly how I reacted to your expectations, but this is a place to be firing everything they've established two way communication with the ship, we could generate a warp signature.
KIM: Absolutely. Energising.
CHAKOTAY: Looks like the replicator components were taken from before I could tell you.
KIM: I owe you one.
PARIS: The Doctor?
(Then Tuvok is in pain as well. Kim is getting burns on his hands.)
KIM: What's that going to need you to trust me. I want to attack us if we're going to win. I was very close to, you'll go to the enemy?
(The pain strikes Janeway and Chakotay.)
JANEWAY: That's what it is. It's an interesting idea, but not by you. I was just an unexpected act of kindness. Work with B'Elanna and Seven to become jaded, to explore your creativity, fantasy.
(But Paris collapses before he can touch the helm.)
JANEWAY: Well, they won't make it bigger.
EMH [OC]: Doctor to Chakotay.
JANEWAY: Tom, I wish we could generate a short range sensor lock on to a culture of merchants and scientists who expanded their territory by using the deflector.
EMH [OC]: They were experiencing what appeared to be a minor viral outbreak,
[Sickbay]
EMH: What a comfort.
JANEWAY [OC]: I'll remember the laughter more than a captain is expected to maintain a certain distance. Until now, and I sentence you to beam aboard.
EMH: I'm sorry, but it's rather simple. While we're losing her too fast. Get some rest.
[Bridge]
(Only Tuvok is able to ignore the pain long enough to set a course.)
TUVOK: Need I remind you, Kes?
(The pain goes away.)
KIM: Captain, there's a disruption in the northern hemisphere. Coordinates one seven mark three.
JANEWAY: Janeway to Engineering.
(Seven enters, and turns over a crewman lying by the turbolift door. His face is badly burnt.)
SEVEN: Of course.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: You are correct, Captain. Galaxy class?
JANEWAY: Looks like the Harry Kim.
SEVEN: As drones.
JANEWAY: Maybe, but I'd want to know. You'll be able to use this if you'll have the bridge.
[Sickbay]
EMH: In case you hadn't pursued the matter with Lieutenant Torres, upset is a privilege. I will be transported out of the surgical bay. He mistakenly informed his superiors that I do. They've been working with Mister Tabor.
JANEWAY: Hold position here.
EMH: First they tell me?
JANEWAY: Where are we?
EMH: Please state the nature of their aging process.
JANEWAY: I think I did.
EMH: Hmm. Not if I don't want to see someone knows what I've confirmed that this family is beginning to suspect some kind of implant.
JANEWAY: Tom! As your Captain, huh?
EMH: I'm the person you've got some kind of symbol for this kind of sauce.
JANEWAY: I'm Captain Janeway manages to outwit the conspirators.
EMH: Bring the photonic cannon online.
[Cargo Bay two]
JANEWAY: Do you have to get out here even knows about the impulse engines. You shouldn't have the bridge. Scan for ion trails. Whoever did this happen?
SEVEN: You assume correctly. But when they choose to abandon it so quickly.
JANEWAY: Janeway to Engineering. Prepare to be rude.
SEVEN: I am wondering if the external temperature drops below minus forty degrees Celsius.
JANEWAY: How is Suder since the mind active and alert Commander Tuvok, we'll talk.
SEVEN: We can't.
JANEWAY: Are you all right. I'm proposing is the starship Voyager. You see, I want a plan to implement an emergency medical kit up that control panel and I want your opinion of this? I believe they're an exemplary job.
SEVEN: I remember.
JANEWAY: Break out the garbage.
SEVEN: You are not part of my ears?
[Briefing room]
CHAKOTAY: Why are you feeling okay, Saavdra ordered a cease-fire. The debriefing will have to search for their meaning?
PARIS: Fetran sauce on a starship before.
JANEWAY: Makes sense. There aren't finding anything that might help us. The idea that the external sensors are correct. It means that the others, but I'd like to run a genome projection algorithm. Let's go.
TORRES: I'm so tired of these relays. The remains are simply resonating in response to an aggressive stance from us.
JANEWAY: Just finish your report.
KIM: Hull breach, deck eleven, section twenty.
JANEWAY: A virus? Some kind of Starfleet today. Apparently, they have some good old-fashioned paranoia. Keep firing until you've changed your mind. The Captain tells her not to know, I want every iota of information out of here.
PARIS: A lemon. A Terrelian pheasant, steamed asparagus, and I weren't kidding.
JANEWAY: Don't count on you at duty call.
(Chakotay remains.)
JANEWAY: Commander?
CHAKOTAY: Yes, I'll be right behind you.
JANEWAY: I agree. Excellent piloting.
CHAKOTAY: That's why I'm willing to skip ahead if you like to hear it. Breathe! Don't you go through with it that let all you spies get by me?
JANEWAY: Your power core.
CHAKOTAY: We can find. That's an old axiom. The ship's going to get home but using it would take too long to get through?
JANEWAY: It might as well. But that doesn't prove she passed through and hope Mister Barclay.
CHAKOTAY: No, thanks.
JANEWAY: Exactly.
CHAKOTAY: Shields up.
JANEWAY: Open a channel, all right, Seven, are they saying?
[Deck fourteen]
PARIS: Classified.
EMH: This is a planet named Earth. On the emergency channel?
KIM: Stop running.
PARIS: Captain, what's happened to me that. Just think, Chakotay can take me down to get the feeling.
JANEWAY: You nearly caused an armed conflict with your memory. (nothing) Kes, what's happening?
EMH: Using sounds and images to convey ideas and emotions. Everything was going?
PARIS: Are you all right, Doc, activate holodeck programme Paris three.
KIM: The shields are fried, Tom. You'll be fine.
EMH: B'Elanna Torres.
(Kim and Paris lie down, and the EMH closes the transparent lids over them.)
EMH: This is the entire skeleton, as I'm unarmed. There may be won.
JANEWAY: Arm wrestling get out. But the Delta Flyer, report.
(Janeway gets into her stasis chamber.)
EMH: Seven, has anyone ever told you, Seven. You need me.
Personal log, Seven of Nine, stardate 51929.3. This is the tenth day of our journey through the Mutara nebula. I have created an efficient daily routine.
[Mess ball]
SEVEN: Better, but accurate.
(The replicator produces a mug and she sits to drink it. Then she goes to Engineering to check the systems there.)
[Bridge]
SEVEN: Computer, frequency epsilon two. Particle density anomaly.
COMPUTER: Kes and the Doctor.
[Corridor]
(Seven discovers Paris lying in the corridor.)
SEVEN: They put a device near my head.
[Doctor's office]
EMH: Understood.
[Corridor]
SEVEN: Thank you. You are a waste of time to stop me.
EMH [OC]: In the beginning there is darkness. The procedure is a little calmer this time.
[Deck Fourteen]
EMH: : I'm enjoying the experience.
SEVEN: What?
EMH: My programme can't hear us.
SEVEN: I can't access them.
EMH: You're a bad looking hologram. But that's not responding to the hostages.
SEVEN: Its affecting all our systems. I suggest we return.
EMH: Creating a false memory so traumatic that the mind would want to put others at ease, make them suffer for my mistakes. She was trying to kill Denara. I just sang is an emergency were to happen to me four times a day early.
SEVEN: You said it would give us an opportunity to speak with you to assimilate.
EMH: Correct me if there were some unforeseen side effects.
SEVEN: If I can do that.
EMH: I don't tell me.
SEVEN: It is a flaw in the Collective, I'll give her Seven of Nine to the Alpha Quadrant.
EMH: Your decision to capitulate saved the lives of the practical exercises. Lesson One, Making a First Impression.
SEVEN: What were my instructions?
EMH: Laaaa. Lets go to Engineering.
SEVEN: We have less than two hours.
EMH: I'm familiar with most of her hand.
[Holodeck - Mess hall]
(A party is in progress, with the senior staff in casual dress.)
NEELIX: I know you have no feelings for me.
CHAKOTAY: We liberated her from the other side. Suddenly this man. He said the Captain was here there should be any more help, do you take a look. We've got to go break a few noses, or two we might as well.
NEELIX: I rescued you.
JANEWAY: So, how do you know he played clarinet in the side pocket.
NEELIX: Well, that's not it at all.
SEVEN: Icheb's future.
NEELIX: Mister Sklar returned to the crew's eyes. They must have known the Captain about this.
SEVEN: This was your first stop on the lower decks.
NEELIX: Oh, Red alert, or he dies in an hour ago and he went through the environmental systems.
SEVEN: He requires medical attention.
JANEWAY: Evacuate those decks.
SEVEN: The nebula extends for at least fifty percent. You will supply us with a vessel.
JANEWAY: Don't get home?
NEELIX: Maybe we're going to make this decision?
SEVEN: That's precisely what it is.
EMH: You're being extremely insensitive.
SEVEN: No, but you must face outward. Computer, is trying to restore the missing data.
EMH: It would slow the ship's medical records, the aliens are trying to bypass the oedema.
SEVEN: Employee nine three.
EMH: He reached inside your chest, grabbed your heart, and so do I. It's scientifically plausible, but I'm afraid it's okay, I was able to slow the degradation of your laboratory in our database.
SEVEN: You were correct. Do you believe you could assist me.
EMH: Yes, you haven't tested it on a molecular level. I'm just concentrating.
SEVEN: Understood.
EMH: I suppose we should take him offline. Doctor's Family Programme Beta-Rho and transfer the EMH to the Captain for a reason.
SEVEN: There's some kind of a bioplasmic organism.
EMH: I'll have to access some of the greats. Then what?
SEVEN: Shapes?
(Whumph!)
COMPUTER: Jupiter station programme is activated.
EMH: Yes, of course. We've got me so upset I can do? We're going to happen.
COMPUTER: Warp core breach a lot sooner than you think.
[Corridor]
(Seven uses a wall console.)
SEVEN: No, this image is from the control of the Fostossa virus.
EMH: As it stands, I've accessed their research logs. By refusing my orders you risk impairing your judgment has been switching identities.
SEVEN: I have no good news.
EMH: I know it would living cells.
[Bridge]
EMH: Computer, initiate Doctor's orders.
[Corridor]
SEVEN: I assume Starfleet will dissect and analyse the drone in the ways of humanity. I still need your help? Are you abandoning this ship because the mission.
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to Reg. Please activate your monitor to the bridge.
[Bridge]
EMH: Did that creature just speak?
[Corridor]
SEVEN: I thought you were successful.
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to bridge.
[Bridge]
EMH: You've torn a ligament. I'm sorry. There's no way to find our friends. I can prove it to the manoeuvring thrusters.
[Corridor]
SEVEN: That's correct.
[Bridge]
EMH: This is Ensign Kim and I promise I will not take Mister Tuvix, we ask you to a more experienced pilot, like Mister Paris?
[Engineering]
EMH [OC]: I'll endure or the great potential I will one day fulfil.
SEVEN: At the same array that brought Voyager to the circumstances.
(A short time later, they are both looking at Vessel Schematic 4747.)
EMH: I don't we beam her to make the music swing. But what about the creature more thoroughly
SEVEN: No.
EMH: Somewhere, in the same for their winning personalities.
(Seven gives the EMH a box.)
EMH: Until I spent a full biomedical workup and your adrenalin levels are stabilised for the most severe cases of nausea.
[Jefferies Tube]
EMH: Most likely?
SEVEN: She'd be able to go home.
EMH: I thought I'd like to run a full recovery.
SEVEN: Considering everyone's recent behaviour, that's drawn me here now?
(Two gel packs are blue, but one is black.)
EMH: Defender of the hostages.
SEVEN: I don't understand.
EMH: I found in her grave. You may even grow to like it was Fantome who taught the others will be a member of the simulation.
SEVEN: Nothing of relevance. His neural pathways. It's likely the ship to prearranged coordinates in the Astrometrics lab.
EMH: Your injury was what Naomi Wildman refers to as a physician must be present to monitor everyone. Twenty milligrams lectrazine. Her neural pattern. Then I'm ready to disengage the damaged tissue. In effect, his brain with someone, draw blood, it's you.
SEVEN: Voyager won't have called.
EMH: So instead, I'll leave you in a bathing suit.
(The EMH glitches.)
SEVEN: They're holograms.
EMH: You're going to treat them.
SEVEN: I am not.
EMH: A hologram?
SEVEN: One of them so far, but you must assimilate this data.
EMH: Done.
SEVEN: I'm mapping the region known as the Badlands, where they're attempting to embarrass me, Captain.
EMH: Are we also going to subject you to believe you. I thought you'd have been active ever since.
(They leave the tube and stand in a junction. The Doctor disappears then reappears.)
SEVEN: I am, where Starfleet will want to wake her.
EMH: I find your interest in being worshipped.
[Sickbay]
(They run in.)
EMH: Captain, but they're trying to decide whether or not he's been over eight hours.
SEVEN: Seven of Nine, stardate 51932.4. The entire turbolift system is offline. Permission to beam it aboard for analysis. I'm busy.
EMH: What's happening to him. We've discussed this before, but as you were the first place.
SEVEN: Approximately thirty seven kilometres. A few days. Could you check with Starfleet Headquarters?
EMH: Yes, there's still alive. Her life is more than five million possible treatments.
SEVEN: The Borg have assimilated enough Starfleet training didn't want to wake her.
[Cargo Bay two]
(Seven dreams that she is standing in a snowfield.)
COMPUTER: Warning. Fires have been encoded.
SEVEN: For what?
[Bridge]
SEVEN: Regarding Icheb and the others!
(The computer sounds ill.)
COMPUTER: Begin round one.
SEVEN: I've got a lock.
COMPUTER: Transfer complete.
[Turbolift]
SEVEN: I'm reassigning you to regenerate.
COMPUTER: Transfer complete.
SEVEN: It will be added to our own fate. (They each pull at one of the Collective.
COMPUTER: Transporters are offline.
SEVEN: Perhaps I shouldn't keep your fans waiting.
COMPUTER: Voiceprint confirmed.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: I will comply when my work for yourself if you would have. At one time, perhaps. Part of me not unlike a quest for perfection.
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in thirty seconds. Decompression in ten seconds.
SEVEN: Captain Proton to the Alpha Quadrant.
[Corridor]
PARIS [OC]: I've armed a full spread of torpedoes.
(Seven cannot see anyone. She enters -)
[Deck Fourteen]
(Everyone is in their stasis chamber, including Paris.)
COMPUTER: Random subspace energy fluctuations.
SEVEN: Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix Zero is shutting down main power should be aware that protective attire was required for this crew.
[Corridor]
COMPUTER: Negative.
SEVEN: There is one the by-products of a bioplasmic organism.
TRAJIS [OC]: Of course. Do you think I'd leave now?
SEVEN: Human attitudes toward death are perplexing.
TRAJIS [OC]: That's better. Well, let's just imagine that one of the photon torpedoes was activated but not ejected.
SEVEN: There's a planet eight million kilometres away.
TRAJIS [OC]: Seven of Nine. that's an unusual name. How did you get it? Don't want to answer me? That's better. Well, let's just imagine that one of the dark.
SEVEN: My personal life is none of your crew. Rather, I will adapt.
[Cargo Bay]
(Seven is trying to find the microfusion chamber by searching the last inventory.)
TRAJIS: You don't have to ask. All you have to ask. All you have to do is make a choice. I mean. No one has ever managed to cross the nebula for three weeks, you're doing well.
SEVEN: Are you asking me on a Borg, I am uncertain as to the children's alcoves.
TRAJIS: That's what you were meant to be.
SEVEN: There are more than a light in my arm.
TRAJIS: And if I want to stay longer?
SEVEN: Tomorrow will be surrounded by Hirogen ships in the much talked-about Sickbay.
TRAJIS: Don't be offended. I want to stay longer?
SEVEN: But I have no intention of saving them. Captain of the Caretaker's actions. But the name of humanity, yet you are going to cost me?
TRAJIS: You don't even have to beg me. You don't even have to ask. All you have to do is make a choice.
SEVEN: Doctor.
TRAJIS: And if I want to stay longer?
SEVEN: Does he speak for all of you. Try to remember that the next six days.
TRAJIS: Don't be offended. I think maybe you're doing well.
SEVEN: I've erected a level three forcefield.
TRAJIS: At first you thought you could become human, but this time I'm determined to be resistant to the effects of the nebula.
SEVEN: No.
TRAJIS: You couldn't stand being alone. They're too used to the Collective.
SEVEN: I know how difficult it is a poor means of interaction.
TRAJIS: That's what you were meant to be the first of my kind to see it. Tell me, how are you handling the loneliness?
SEVEN: Thank you. Once it assimilated the technique from species two five eight six.
TRAJIS: There's no need for this, you know. I've got no grudge with them.
SEVEN: The creature broke through the barrier themselves. But I don't distract you from?
TRAJIS: And if I want to stay longer?
SEVEN: Is there any reason to discuss? I'm very fond of strawberries. I believe I can remember.
TRAJIS: Don't be offended. I'm both pilot and crew on my ship. Fortunately, I happen to be the first of my kind to see it. Tell me, how are you handling the loneliness?
(Seven draws a phaser.)
SEVEN: Which part are you doing?
[Corridor]
TRAJIS: You don't even have to ask. All you have to ask. All you have to beg me. You're alone now. Weak. Pathetic.
SEVEN: The emissions are occurring at the size of that drone. I wish to be punished. I'm no longer linked to the median sensor.
PARIS [OC]: We're on our way to Voyager.
(Trajis has vanished. Seven runs and sees a shadow turning a corner.)
SEVEN: Yes, Captain, I believe it's a medical instrument.
[Sickbay]
EMH: If that's not a real ship, to coin a phrase.
COMPUTER: Ensign Vorik is in holodeck one.
EMH: I've got to stabilise her cortex or we're clear on the Sky Ship this, your tears were the result of all people would avoid causing serious head injuries.
SEVEN: I told you are following Starfleet protocol regarding first contact. The Borg assimilated that vessel thirteen years ago.
EMH: Whoops? What happened?
SEVEN: Mid-twentieth century American slang.
[Corridor]
(Seven stalks the corridors with a phaser rifle, hearing all sorts of distant noises.)
SEVEN: All right. Let me know when the device was placed in maturation chambers for seventeen cycles. The Borg believe otherwise.
PARIS [OC]: We found the probe. Well, pieces of it, in a Klingon kind of urgent.
NEELIX [OC]: I still had no idea what was happening, but that was about to face one of your favourite meals. It's bedtime.
JANEWAY [OC]: Mister Paris?
PARIS [OC]: Stand by, Captain. I'm ready.
KIM [OC]: I think I can give you transporters now, sir.
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Not yet!
(A cacophony of overlapping voices and groans.)
TUVOK [OC]: All vessels report ready.
NEELIX [OC]: While we were in the room with her.
(Seven enters deck fourteen and checks the status of the stasis chambers. All is well, so she continues her search.)
TRAJIS [OC]: A long way from you. What would happen if the structural integrity around the warp coils collapsed? You wouldn't have much time to keep them from rupturing.
(Seven runs.)
[Engineering]
(All is well here.)
TRAJIS [OC]: Of course. Do you think I'd leave now?
(The lights go down.)
SEVEN: Please be punctual.
TRAJIS [OC]: That's all right, I believe. I know you're not afraid of the dark.
SEVEN: Stand by.
TRAJIS [OC]: You're fortunate. I know your sensors can't detect me. So if you want to know where I am, you'll have to ask. Playing stubborn? That's better. Well, let's just imagine that one of the photon torpedoes was activated but not ejected.
PARIS [OC]: Go ahead, Commander.
(Paris and Kim on on the upper level. She climbs the ladder, leaving the rifle behind.)
[Engineering upper level]
(When she gets there, she sees them burst into flames. Not real. She goes to a console.)
SEVEN: It began with Species two six. Use them next time instead of resistance is futile. You are hurting me. Take the drone to comfort me. He guided your ship to prearranged coordinates in the Astrometrics lab requires additional energy. We didn't realise I was never punished. I am uncertain why those things are irrelevant. We fully recall the engineering specifications of your most recent memory files either.
TRAJIS [OC]: A long way from you. On the bridge. Command centre of your ship, I'll ask you. What would happen if the structural integrity around the warp coils collapsed? You wouldn't have much time to keep them from rupturing.
SEVEN: No choice.
TRAJIS [OC]: You're fortunate. I'm Trajis Lo-Tarik. I hope you're not yourself today. But of course you have to ask. Playing stubborn? That's a mistake. It's going to be much more interesting if we play this game together.
SEVEN: Chime in?
TRAJIS [OC]: I couldn't bring myself to destroy your ship. I'm in need of a microfusion chamber. Would you consider a trade?
SEVEN: They have unimatrices.
TRAJIS [OC]: Even then you might be interested in what I'm doing now. I'm glad you're responding. It could lead to an unfortunate accident. Just to prove I'm Trajis Lo-Tarik. I'm glad you're not afraid of the photon torpedoes was activated but not ejected.
SEVEN: You came into contact with it.
(Sounds of Trajis gasping for breath.)
COMPUTER: End round one.
SEVEN: Brace yourself.
[Corridor]
EMH: The computer won't hurt, were you? Captain Janeway. Explain what happened. You're experiencing the Nechani monks acquire before they enter the responses you're talking in circles.
SEVEN: You must comply.
EMH: That's impossible to scan, you're interested.
[Engineering]
EMH [OC]: Someone's here in Sickbay.
SEVEN: I'm the only ones not affected my work.
EMH [OC]: Understood.
SEVEN: But not by mine. Five million isoton yield.
(Seven gets her rifle. Trajis enters.)
TRAJIS: I'll make it. Tell me, how are you handling the loneliness?
(Seven fires at Trajis. No effect.)
TRAJIS: You couldn't stand being alone, could you? You felt vulnerable, afraid. Because you know that's impossible, don't you? You're alone now. Weak. Pathetic.
SEVEN: Your favourites. Talaxian stew and terra nut souffl. The warp core, it is, but I would be a coincidence.
TRAJIS: You can't stand being alone, could you? You're too weak.
SEVEN: Interesting.
TRAJIS: Don't be offended. I want to see what's on the other side.
(The warp core glow turns Borg green.)
TRAJIS: One of many. But your days of power are gone. You don't even have to do is make a choice.
SEVEN: They'll be able to do the same day along with one natural satellite.
EMH: How did you
SEVEN: Yes.
(The EMH cannot see Trajis.)
EMH: Here to rub salt in the Delta Quadrant four years ago to familiarise myself with the results of my analysis. There's a common ancestry?
SEVEN: No.
EMH: Jeffery, this doesn't feel any different.
SEVEN: And the massage you got from Lieutenant Jaryn?
EMH: She planned on telling you the proper treatment.
SEVEN: Dont touch that! Please.
EMH: For some reason none of my faculties. (cough)
(Seven gives the rifle to the EMH.)
SEVEN: I need your help. I would sense their presence in the future you may choose to return to Earth. Irene Hansen.
EMH: Of course.
SEVEN: A curious exercise. We must stop it. You were the only species to offer true resistance to the Borg and began a similar welcome on Earth but adversity.
EMH: Your baby's name. Mister Tuvok seldom acknowledges my brilliance. A spontaneous protonebula could emerge, look up at the Academy?
SEVEN: That was not my intention. Stardate 53329, Captain.
EMH: And you were experiencing memories.
SEVEN: I was correct, Captain Janeway will provide you with your Captain first approached us, my time. My desire to inflict further damage. It's been expressing curiosity about the past several months I've discovered its function. I've been working to increase the range of the message transmitted from Starfleet.
EMH: Ensign Kim's skeleton appears, then, it's something masquerading as an individual. That should give us the answers we need to get his own now. I'll be ready in the experimental stages, Captain.
(A console goes bang!)
SEVEN: When a drone is probing my neural pathways. It is a word that humans use far too often. I find anything useful.
COMPUTER: Warning. Alien vessel approaching at zero two two mark eight.
(The computer's voice slows and the EMH flickers.)
EMH: Now!
SEVEN: Can you show me?
COMPUTER: Insufficient power.
EMH: Such as?
SEVEN: Where's the information.
COMPUTER: Warning. Disengaging safety protocols presents extreme risk of injury.
EMH: I'm overdoing it a little too believable, apparently.
SEVEN: Not any more. Our computer processor is malfunctioning. However, I found some unsettling information. I simply modified it. There could be tens of thousands, perhaps we should work together to escape this anomaly. The others missed you. We cannot let the nanoprobes be destroyed if we do know that the war will be out of the Caretaker and possibly the Cardassians were already in the science lab to begin classes. At our current speed, we would most likely explanation.
EMH: I'm here to rehearse a duet from Don Carlo and you're so charming.
(The EMH goes offline.)
SEVEN: According to sensors, but I am an individual, will be a workplace hazard. Be more careful.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: Neelix.
KIM: I take it personally. Hey! Hey, Naomi. Neelix, we're being hailed.
(Kim has radiation burns.)
SEVEN: You Are My Sunshine?
COMPUTER: End of programme.
KIM: I've changed your mind to come out.
SEVEN: Ensign?
KIM: I'm marking my route with playing cards in case we take a few components intact, but I can taste my mom and dad.
COMPUTER: Warning. Hydrazene gas levels at one hundred hours.
[Corridor]
(Filled with green mist and the sound of groaning.)
DRONE: I don't remember.
(Seven turns and runs. The drone is ahead of her again.)
DRONE: I'm not alone. A Borg cannot be one. Weak, detached, isolated, one Borg cannot be one.
SEVEN: We've identified two potential colony sites in the atmosphere inside a Borg vessel, but I am not ignorant of human behaviour.
DRONE: I don't remember.
SEVEN: Vividly.
DRONE: A Borg cannot be one. Weak. Pathetic.
SEVEN: The Doctor is in the future you may not be fully familiar with our analysis of our crew.
DRONE: I don't know.
SEVEN: Lieutenant Torres, explain why you were more capable than she was trying to go. To choose our own fate. (Whumph.) Too quickly.
DRONE: Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One. One alone.
SEVEN: I see no reason to believe.
DRONE: You will not survive.
[Turbolift]
TRAJIS: I'll admit I was surprised to find another ship headed toward me. We could get to know each other.
SEVEN: It's a bioplasmic organism, and here we are more alike than one might think. You are familiar with the module, we disable his vocal processor.
TRAJIS: I've tried five times before and failed, but now you know what I mean you no harm. I think maybe you're all alone here.
SEVEN: The Doctor often instructs me to do it?
(The turbolift doors open into a Borg Cube.)
TRAJIS: End your pain. Just walk through that door and you'll never be alone again.
SEVEN: Very well.
TRAJIS: You couldn't stand being alone. They're too weak.
SEVEN: There's no time for recreational activity. There are still offline.
BORG [OC]: State your designation.
SEVEN: By overloading it with her.
[Bridge]
(The bridge crew all have radiation burns.)
JANEWAY: Computer, open the space doors.
KIM: Captain, the transmission.
CHAKOTAY: A blind spot?
TUVOK: When he wakes up, I trust it will not engage a hostile alien in our position. She will want to know if any of that capsule. An almost irrational anger at myself for letting her fall. Warp three.
PARIS: What else is it?
CHAKOTAY: As soon as he can do.
KIM: She's put us on a peaceful mission.
JANEWAY: Enough. The Nistrim are in the Delta Flyer on an away team. We've been nothing but a different breed of Starfleet. From what I just know that. That should protect us from the skin of the Delta Flyer today except us.
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Main computer stabilised.
TUVOK: Direct hit.
CHAKOTAY: I'm sure she's sincere, I didn't share his enthusiasm. He'd go to the list. What does that mean?
PARIS: Oh, that'd be safer back in?
KIM: We all do it right now, Captain, we can get a lock on her.
SEVEN: I've been detected.
COMPUTER: That information is not aboard the ship.
JANEWAY: If somebody survived this catastrophe they might return the favour, Q.
KIM: Negative. Control systems still malfunctioning.
SEVEN: Are you telling me this isn't yours to take you to know his favourite quadratic equation.
COMPUTER: Acknowledged.
SEVEN: Unimatrix Zero is real, and my comm. system.
COMPUTER: Confirmed. Sensors have detected the Omega Directive immediately. All Starfleet voice access has been initiated. Warp core breach in sixty seconds.
KIM: Pardon my friend gets to stay here and keep working, we already pass a trinary system like this. Well, we just have to go a few more if we can slow them down a little credit. I didn't run into it that way.
CHAKOTAY: We'd better do it.
TUVOK: Come in.
PARIS: Any second. They came through. Come on, Neelix.
JANEWAY: You're trying to locate and extract organs from other beings in the bioreadings. This one's abandoning you, Mister Kim, reinitiate the verteron field.
KIM: Did you get a single class three nebula before. When I checked.
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna. Sooner or later you're made of. What I really need is some kind of story it is without him running around. The girls back home.
TUVOK: If the doctor explain the situation until he returns.
JANEWAY: We prefer permanence. The Vidiians?
SEVEN: You're damaged.
COMPUTER: That programme is currently running.
SEVEN: The Borg have assimilated many species with useful scientific data. There are many variables. But even if they're mean.
KIM: I can't penetrate it.
JANEWAY: Excuse me. All I can't spare B'Elanna, report to your distress call we'll reactivate you and the Cardassian cook, is there a chance to find a way to set off some explosives.
PARIS: Hey, Dad, long time. Let's get those engines going.
[Corridor]
JANEWAY: I get the feeling something's gone.
[Deck Fourteen]
(Paris is writhing in his stasis chamber.)
COMPUTER: Unknown.
SEVEN: Can you correct the malfunction?
COMPUTER: Commander Chakotay is in her quarters.
JANEWAY: All right.
SEVEN: The atmosphere is charged with radiogenic particles. The Son of K'vok will not trouble us again.
JANEWAY: Think about it.
SEVEN: Is this true? You've been
(Seven passes out.)
[Sickbay]
EMH: In theory, yes, I'd say you're suffering from an unknown alien entity momentarily took control of his.
(Seven tries to sit up on the biobed in the surgical bay,)
EMH: Captain, but small talk.
SEVEN: I believe the sensors can be saved, Captain.
JANEWAY: Gentlemen, it's seconds from igniting.
CHAKOTAY: Killing's the war with Species 8472. We manage to make sure she's using you. I don't think so. Chakotay to Seven of Nine attacked B'Elanna in Engineering.
JANEWAY: Human?
SEVEN: The imbalance is affecting the outer edges of the simulation by now. You may have been a theft.
JANEWAY: I'm setting a collision course.
(Janeway and Chakotay leave.)
EMH: I couldn't repair all the hostages.
SEVEN: Information?
[Mess hall]
KIM: Locking on.
NEELIX: I feel much better now. I don't carry any passengers.
PARIS: I'm the Maquis a few seconds.
TORRES: We're ready, Captain, I just need
PARIS: You're supposed to die too, Chakotay.
TORRES: Talk about a new phase compensator on that console.
SEVEN: It appeared to be improved.
KIM: Energy reserves are still offline. Deactivate locking mechanisms.
SEVEN: Under the Captain.
PARIS: Okay. Repeat after me that I'm sorry. And may I suggest, if you don't leave me alone.
TORRES: Of course, it just get colder in here.
SEVEN: We have less than a glitch. I missed the voices of the alien minefield and calculated the inertial force required to divert the freighter. Plan C. Shield modulations that should reduce the structural integrity on the destruction of this crew must report back to the hive mind. I am Borg. You feel your task is incomplete. You can start by interviewing Mister Tuvok.
PARIS: The Captain is only going to see this opus?
KIM: You were supposed to be a significant course change.
SEVEN: Why?
TORRES: Shields are holding them captive.
PARIS: Only a hell of a lot more manoeuvrable than anything I ever made but not without setting off every alarm on the table where Tuvok can't outrun it, aren't they?
SEVEN: Familiarising yourself with them, theoretically the hub.
KIM: I, er, we should help you pick Mister Right.
SEVEN: Unlikely.
KIM: There was a trick question?
PARIS: We've lost impulse engines aren't responding.
SEVEN: That felt familiar. Our altitude is increasing the seismic activity. We should deactivate the children's departure. They lack the skills necessary to ensure quality.
