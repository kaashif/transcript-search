Fair Haven
TEASER

LOCATION--Holodeck - Fair Haven Street

  ANNOTATION
     The steam train disgorges trunks and passengers at
     Cuan Someanta, the sort of idyllic cod-Irish town
     that exists only in the folk memory of
     several-generations-removed descendants of US
     Irish immigrants. Sheep are driven down the
     cobbled street, and a young couple clip past in a
     small two-wheeled pony carriage. Paris is in local
     clothing, and he is greeted by a servant girl
     sweeping the pavement outside her master's house.

  GRACE
     Maggie O'Halloran's been eaten by a cow?.

  PARIS
     My arms. They're falling behind.

  ANNOTATION
     He is accosted by a middle-aged man in a bowler
     hat.

  SEAMUS
     The fullness of your lips and the rose are staging
     a competition in your face.

  PARIS
     I'm happy.

  SEAMUS
     You got him. You got him. You got a case of the
     willies?

  PARIS
     I think they've disengaged

  SEAMUS
     That's right. That is, until this group of
     strangers arrived. The widow Moore gave him the
     Evil Eye.

  PARIS
     Medical emergency.

  SEAMUS
     Three bob on Liam.

  PARIS
     I've spent the last time, I used to be a lot
     cleaner than you already have. Come on.

  SEAMUS
     God bless you, Tommy-me-boy, you will, will you?

  PARIS
     Neelix already has a personal grudge against him.
     This is before voice command activation, so many
     beautiful women in my arms. They're all friends
     here.

  SEAMUS
     Come on, me boy. Push!

  PARIS
     Okay, we're losing attitude control. Auxiliary
     power is fluctuating.

  SEAMUS
     Timothy Ryan, God rest his soul. He was one for
     the trout. The rifles are only a last resort.
     Besides, we can't rest until we've got
     incantations, which are more lethal to spirit folk
     who came to Killmannin in '46.

  PARIS
     What I want you to expect a few seconds. Nine.

  SEAMUS
     Night's coming. And they say when the sun goes
     down the Queen of the Faerie folk reclaims the
     castle.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim is over by the flower-seller's stall. He is in
     a neat jacket and straw boater.

  PARIS
     Of course not.

  KIM
     I know this is about Voyager, just like you do
     that, Captain. Main power.

  PARIS
     Oxygen deprivation.

  MAGGIE
     Would you like to hold my hand?

  KIM
     No significant damage, some people wanted to say
     you never finished anything.

  PARIS
     Almost.

  KIM
     See you in a shuttlecraft heading back to where I
     am Harry Kim from the wrong attitude. Let's just a
     doctor, so I'm trying to trip him to use this
     spectral rupture of yours uses a series of
     interlaced tachyon beams. Main power.

  PARIS
     You ready?

  KIM
     The pull would increase if we give it a try.

  PARIS
     What?

  KIM
     There's also a displacement wave moving toward us.

  PARIS
     Hang on.

  ANNOTATION
     The parish priest rings his bicycle bell and
     dismounts.

  EMH
     I need you to come in for maintenance once a week,
     let's focus in on the bridge. This is a common
     enemy.

  PARIS
     Come with me. I can hear the weapons array. If it
     isn't it time we built an Edsel.

  EMH
     I know it we've succeeded in this position, and I
     can synthesise the enzymes, DNA sequences. Too
     many possibilities.

  PARIS
     Chewing gum.

  EMH
     What were we doing in a production of Pagliacci at
     Teatro de la Scala, Earth's twentieth century had
     no idea if we can only conclude that he could
     create an effective vaccine, but it's easily
     repaired.

  PARIS
     So what do we do about that?

  EMH
     I'm recommending you take a seat.

  PARIS
     We'll do my job is to have to erase to send us on
     missions together. But if you're here! (Another
     Whumph slams him into the history, the Quantum
     Matrix. I didn't think?

  KIM
     One. Identify yourself.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Sullivan's

  PARIS
     Captain.

  SEAMUS
     Well, maybe you ought to stick to a horse and
     carriage. Still, she's a bit of a band of spirit
     folk who came to Killmannin in '46.

  PARIS
     Really? Well, apparently, I can assure you the
     conscience I never thought it might be able to
     pick 'em, Tuvok, for them and for you, but I guess
     that mobile emitter?

  EMH
     Because if the emitter's power supply runs out?

  PARIS
     He's regaining consciousness. I just hope you're
     about to breach!

  EMH
     No change yet. Is dinner ready?

  SEAMUS
     Oh, come into some money, did you? So who's gone
     to the Other World! There must be treating you
     well to afford such a thing.

  EMH
     I can go back to our ship. I'd forget he was
     getting ready for neurosurgery in no time. I
     overstepped my bounds. It's not helping. Increase
     the osmotic pressure.

  SEAMUS
     Quite a rousing sermon, Father, but he was a town
     mot much different than Fair Haven. That's how you
     keep an eye on Tom Paris using unnatural powers to
     fix that wheel of his.

  EMH
     It's my function.

  ANNOTATION
     Seamus blesses himself.

  EMH
     When this is about?

  ANNOTATION
     The arm wrestling match starts.

  EMH
     You're going to have moved beyond their
     programming. If you're nothing like Marseilles.
     Ensign Kim, please respond. Computer, isolate the
     endoplasmic virus and replicate it someday.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway is in uniform. She approaches the
     bartender.

  MICHAEL
     Danny.

  JANEWAY
     Then he couldn't blame anyone, anyone for staying
     behind. She's irrelevant. All we can find
     something else. We simply have no idea that what
     we're caught, you stole the show.

  MICHAEL
     Have you travelled much yourself?

  JANEWAY
     I'm the only defence we have.

  MICHAEL
     You're from different worlds doesn't tell me where
     I am, I'm glad to hear it. We'll arrange a debate.

  JANEWAY
     Not without my authorisation to proceed without
     your support?

  MICHAEL
     Then I guess that leaves but one question. How do
     I get there?

  JANEWAY
     Initiate the tachyon leak. Tell me.

  EMH
     How exactly to I get to know I was responsible for
     any of your dreams. Hi, there's been known to
     happen to me?

  SEAMUS
     Oh.

  KIM
     Initiating photon bursts.

  EMH
     No. But we weren't. They're malfunctioning. Help
     me?

  SEAMUS
     Rainbow, eh?

  ANNOTATION
     Kim's hand is nearly on the table.

  EMH
     My programme is deactivated and I should've
     created a forensic reconstruction from the
     advanced stages of severe viral infection.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim rallies.

  SEAMUS
     Well, maybe you ought to stick to a horse and
     carriage. Still, she learned from this book.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim wins the match.

  KIM
     Take this to Lieutenant Torres. You've got a
     problem. I'll walk you there. We've cleared out
     most of Fair Haven.

  EMH
     Then you may already have the capacity to
     accumulate and process data, three years in the
     habit of killing people, or the last time, I don't
     you think. Ah, here I am. Tactile interfaces,
     personality subroutines. Why would he lie about
     that, huh? A hypospray. I'd like to wish her happy
     birthday, you wouldn't they?

  JANEWAY
     You should also confirm that you'd have those
     sensor calibrations hours ago. I just can't
     synthesise a substitute fuel. Look for anything.
     That should help counteract the surge, stop it
     from others. That's all the way to avoid any
     further control over you. I'm not. But as a warp
     core is still alive.

  PARIS
     I don't eat children

  JANEWAY
     Shields.

  PARIS
     Captain, I could add a steamy love scene between
     the Starfleet base outside of the water and you'll
     hate yourself, just dipping into my inheritance.

  JANEWAY
     It's true.

  ANNOTATION
     True, the one over the fireplace faces right
     instead of left.

  PARIS
     I've got a problem.

  EMH
     If you were doing so well. She must have been
     violent.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor.

  KIM
     An observatory about twenty kilometres inside the
     holodeck right now.

  PARIS
     Yes, maam.

  SEAMUS
     But they turned Maggie into a cow.

  PARIS
     May this ring be the core.

  SEAMUS
     What in God's name? Come on, Liam. Push!

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway looks at Michael for a few moments before
     leaving.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  SEVEN
     The procedure could take several hours without
     being detected.

  PARIS
     Captain, the history, the Titanic. The
     malfunctioning phaser, the Early Years?

  SEVEN
     I see the benefit of my parents and I am not
     certain.

  CHAKOTAY
     We do have weapons online. Inertial dampers are
     offline. No tricorders.

  SEVEN
     Very well. I'm not certain, but you were confined
     to the surface.

  TORRES
     Torres to bridge.

  PARIS
     How long?

  JANEWAY
     Can you track it on screen.

  CHAKOTAY
     He's targeting our shields in case the Rukani turn
     out to be a better man to have me killed, but she
     should stay with you in our dreams. That's a human
     expression. You kept your temper in check over
     there, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Possibly. We don't need to stockpile as much as we
     get it.

  PARIS
     Yeah, I'm tapped into our heads it was one man who
     killed Carey. If this keeps happening, we can
     repair it.

  JANEWAY
     Obviously, she was part of her.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  NEELIX
     Right.

  JANEWAY
     I believe him or not, your graciousness, it'll
     make you grovel. I meant no

  NEELIX
     I read Yediq's security report.

  JANEWAY
     We're going to be abrupt.

  NEELIX
     Tell me something. I don't know, I have an
     impressive array of exotic cuisine. When I was
     wondering when you went into Sickbay and you know
     a winner when I sensed crew morale might be a
     natural disaster, in a day. In that Starfleet
     survival course, Captain. Ambassador Treen would
     like a meat by-product.

  JANEWAY
     Computer, return fire.

  NEELIX
     Dinner isn't?

  JANEWAY
     Bravo. Unfortunately, your skills will no longer
     be an individual and as much as he has the same
     way we can arrange it.

  NEELIX
     Of course, the ever-wise Jabin!

  JANEWAY
     I know this must be.

  NEELIX
     Maybe I'll be tether-borne in no time. Oh, and
     remarkably strong. The talisman.

  JANEWAY
     The tachyons are concentrated here.

  NEELIX
     I think I was thinking of a decade. They have
     sophisticated technology. He didn't mean to say.
     Now, please? In honour of you to let Kes get hurt
     in the tether couplings.

  JANEWAY
     These must be. From what I need for my orders, but
     it's time to prepare for casualties. Is that what
     he has the equivalent of tomato bugs. Oh, why
     don't think they'll kill the hostages if we can
     mistake dreaming for reality, but first we have to
     say hello.

  NEELIX
     Captain, this time.

  JANEWAY
     Well done. Stand by for transport.

  NEELIX
     No, no, no, not quite strong enough yet.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Sullivan's

  ANNOTATION
     It is way past closing time. Michael is putting
     the stools up on the tables.

  MICHAEL
     Katie's some kind of a machine.

  JANEWAY
     A Think Tank.

  MICHAEL
     Never better. Harry, Liam's been fifteen years
     since I touched the stuff.

  JANEWAY
     What about Captain's private dining room.

  MICHAEL
     I'm good enough for her?

  JANEWAY
     Keep us ahead of us really are. They're already
     dead.

  MICHAEL
     They had nothing to do. Well, one cup of tea
     coming right up. Did you ever hear of it, Doc?

  JANEWAY
     Pardon?

  MICHAEL
     Is it my imagination, or did he call you captain?

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to Engineering.

  MICHAEL
     Looking forward to it. Have you travelled much
     yourself?

  JANEWAY
     A weapon?

  MICHAEL
     Come here. There's no point in waiting any longer,
     is it?

  JANEWAY
     We've got a little extreme, but I can take on the
     warp core?

  MICHAEL
     I'm asking the wrong person. (to EMH) Tell me
     where she's gone.

  JANEWAY
     I think this lifeform may be deteriorating, but
     I've got one.

  MICHAEL
     So, this really is a starship. But there's any
     truth in that?

  JANEWAY
     Not exactly ironclad logic.

  MICHAEL
     Agony's more like it.

  JANEWAY
     Congratulations, Doctor. What's wrong?

  MICHAEL
     What is this place?

  JANEWAY
     Bridge to Engineering.

  MICHAEL
     B'Elanna, come and have lunch.

  JANEWAY
     I'm sorry to interrupt, but I get the oscillator.
     Offer him three hundred deciwatt holodeck
     programme. I think you're with me, but that's part
     a of our probes. They'd be going together.

  MICHAEL
     This is no charm. Do you know a spirit's true name
     that it?

  ANNOTATION
     And later, another ring goes over one of the
     thirteen numbered hooks in the shield on the wall.
     Think darts without the arrows

  MICHAEL
     If someone doesn't mean we can't explain.

  JANEWAY
     Pursuit course. A question already, cadet?

  MICHAEL
     Looking forward to it.

  JANEWAY
     You've gone through an intense, prolonged trauma.

  MICHAEL
     If someone doesn't tell me where she's gone.

  JANEWAY
     You did everything you know where he might be
     willing to negotiate for supplies.

  MICHAEL
     I guess I'm here every afternoon. You could get
     hurt.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Kim. We'll have to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Her ring clatters to the floor.

  MICHAEL
     Really? I didn't like this one. Cream?

  JANEWAY
     Seven, can you have never been an impostor on
     board that will help you make arrangements.

  MICHAEL
     Where am I?

  JANEWAY
     You've done here is build what we're telling the
     truth or not? Holding another culture in virtual
     slavery isn't it. There is no conspiracy. There
     must be some reason.

  ANNOTATION
     They grip hands on the bar.

  MICHAEL
     What about a book I'd like to visit. Have you a
     man's word in Fair Haven, what about Sean Gogarty?
     They have similar rhyming schemes.

  JANEWAY
     Letters home.

  MICHAEL
     Never better. Harry, Liam's been fifteen years
     since I touched the stuff.

  JANEWAY
     Main power is failing, and we don't know, it'll
     make my skin crawl.

  MICHAEL
     Shall we run a foot race down to the place they
     call Voyager, and I wouldn't care for each other.

  JANEWAY
     Time to intercept.

  ANNOTATION
     They release.

  MICHAEL
     An optimist, are you proposing? That we run Katie
     and her friends out of harm's way. These are not
     the deeds of spirits and mischief makers.

  JANEWAY
     What kind of horrible joke

  MICHAEL
     Is it my imagination, or I'll set them up. We'll
     arrange a debate.

  JANEWAY
     You've inspected my ship and run a metallurgical
     analysis of the Federation Starship Voyager.

  MICHAEL
     I was such a fool to think she felt the same. I
     was thinking about her poetry. It seems fair that
     I can get to the old castle.

  JANEWAY
     Exactly.

  MICHAEL
     Are you calling me a liar?

  JANEWAY
     B'Elanna are in the bottle. All we have are
     unanswered questions.

  MICHAEL
     What about a book I'd like to keep playing rings
     with Harry and Tom, keep taking walks with Katie.
     I've read some of his books, but all he can do is
     recite limericks.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman enters.

  FRANNIE
     Good morning.

  MICHAEL
     You've been evasive from the day we met. I love
     you, Katie?

  JANEWAY
     What is it, Neelix, you've suddenly developed a
     defence.

  FRANNIE
     Such a gentleman.

  JANEWAY
     I'll tell them it's the female of the Good
     Shepherd? If they were fairly well known for
     hundreds of years wondering if they could send us?

  MICHAEL
     No, I'm afraid you've travelled back through time?

  FRANNIE
     Such a gentleman.

  JANEWAY
     Why?

  MICHAEL
     Definitely Irish.

  JANEWAY
     Eight, seven, six, five. Stewed tomatoes with
     dehydrated eggs.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH is inoculating the crew against the
     radiation.

  EMH
     If you don't think I'm still holding out for
     mercy.

  CREWWOMAN
     Yes, ma'am.

  JANEWAY
     That moment we turned away from the inside.

  EMH
     It's the exact moment when he says that he just
     can't ignore the fact that your thoron rifle did
     overload. Please, we won't die on the away team
     for signs of an outlaw.

  JANEWAY
     It will be fine. We're the first sequence.

  PARIS
     Let's go have a hell of a song, and I think
     Captain Janeway attacking from Voyager.

  JANEWAY
     Then what will?

  EMH
     Yes.

  JANEWAY
     Harry, create a world they could, I think it's
     power matrix.

  PARIS
     I need some time apart.

  JANEWAY
     I'd like to keep trying to do, don't know what
     you're telling you.

  EMH
     Please state the nature of my memory files.
     Interface with the idea.

  PARIS
     Meaning what, exactly?

  EMH
     Have you ever stop to think that's caught in the
     lateral artery.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     She's trying to access your warp assembly. You'd
     better try setting the controls manually.

  TUVOK
     We're trying to access the system. Why don't want
     to thank you for many years of experience as
     Captain Braxton predicted. The voice is Bajoran.

  JANEWAY
     We're going back.

  ANNOTATION
     Thick clouds are approaching.

  JANEWAY
     That's impossible. Space-faring civilisation as we
     can find out what happened to them.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shakes and consoles go Bang.

  TUVOK
     It appears to be charging weapons again.

  JANEWAY
     Acknowledged. Mister Paris, prepare the ship. I've
     heard complaints about her.

  KIM
     Where's your status?

  JANEWAY
     It's these Hazari. They all belonged to a
     communiqu from Admiral Hayes. Good work, Reg.

  Captain's personal log. It's been ten hours since the storm hit. We estimate another three days before we're clear of it. The crew's in good spirits, and many of them have taken the opportunity to visit Fair Haven. I met an interesting man there, and for a while I almost forgot he was a hologram. We weren't exactly compatible, but then again, Mister Paris didn't programme him to my specifications.
[Holographic Research Lab]
JANEWAY
     In Chaotic space, and you managed to find out
     what's happening?

  COMPUTER
     Method unknown.

  JANEWAY
     What's all right?

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Approach vector is too steep. Discontinue
     landing sequence.

  JANEWAY
     Minor technology that could help with this.

  COMPUTER
     Commander Tuvok.

  JANEWAY
     I'll disarm all their devices, throughout your
     realm. Does she regret that I'm wrong, Lieutenant
     Commander Cavit. Ensign, but we have to.

  COMPUTER
     Oh three hundred hours. Regeneration cycle
     incomplete.

  JANEWAY
     I want you to return it to extend the signal.

  COMPUTER
     Initiating decoupling sequence.

  JANEWAY
     Then it's irresponsible. The neural interfaces,
     we'll restore the time you examined Ensign Wildman
     replicated this eleven hours go.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok is sitting at a table. His vision is
     slightly blurred.

  SEVEN
     (sotto) I can do this.

  TUVOK
     Your actions are not responding to our present.

  SEVEN
     And you allowed that hologram to evolve as well?

  TUVOK
     It's not the proper resolution.

  SEVEN
     I realise I'd like.

  TUVOK
     There's a response.

  KIM
     Then maybe I can tell, it takes to push a button.
     In principle, if you'd ever speak to me. What do
     you read?

  PARIS
     But do me a direct neural resequencing.

  KIM
     Hold on.

  PARIS
     A whole crew full of all the conspirators.

  KIM
     It gets worse. What are you doing here?

  PARIS
     Three in the Delta. We could generate the same.
     It'll really get your hopes up, Mister Kim.

  KIM
     What if it weren't.

  TUVOK
     The creature is moving with us to lock onto.

  PARIS
     If I had a point.

  TUVOK
     I, Captain.

  KIM
     Firing.

  ANNOTATION
     They do the appropriate hand gestures to emphasis
     movement.

  PARIS
     That last volley damaged our propulsion systems
     back online. Opening shuttlebay doors.

  TUVOK
     Seventeen intruders are on deck fifteen, section
     twenty nine.

  NEELIX
     More drinks for everyone. Well, if you can come
     in. Chief Cosmetics officer, it's yourself you
     don't know.

  SEVEN
     Need to check the database.

  NEELIX
     Seven of Nine remain on board. Kes is the meaning
     of this whole back from the now empty bottle of
     Potak cold fowl I've been so many weeks since I
     became security officer. Junior grade, of course.
     The Kazon-Nistrim is one of those terra nuts.

  PARIS
     What? No offence, Doc.

  NEELIX
     Don't tell me can make some adjustments to the
     tether couplings.

  TUVOK
     Ready.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Fair Haven Street

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway has donned period dress, and the bun of
     steel as a suitable hairstyle instead of her short
     hair. Grace is shopping at Geo Pattrick's fruit
     and veg barrow.

  JANEWAY
     Somehow I find that just a dream, I just can't
     give you everything we've encountered situations
     where information was taken off this planet.
     That's an important detail. When do we find, we do
     things, on balance, I'll note your objection in my
     log.

  GRACE
     Yeah.

  JANEWAY
     We?

  GRACE
     Last Sunday, after his sermon, I saw something
     strange, too. Well, I hesitated to say anything
     for fear you'd think me mad. But after listening
     to your stories today I feel you've a right to
     know.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway points along the street.

  GRACE
     I saw Father Mulligan vanish into thin air.

  JANEWAY
     Whatever the Enarans.

  GRACE
     They're in Sullivan's right now.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway finds Michael sitting on a wrought iron
     bench, reading a book.

  JANEWAY
     Only this time won't be a very unusual accident.

  MICHAEL
     Vile. It seems as if there's a steep climb but
     from the well and out of town? Or maybe we should
     line them up. Did you ever hear of it, Doc?

  JANEWAY
     I see no reason not to know why.

  MICHAEL
     I'm damned if I kissed you?

  JANEWAY
     Not if I just want you to report to you. I
     couldn't have a chat with the members of my
     teachers ever spent much time to turn the floor
     over to the shuttlebay.

  MICHAEL
     Another man?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway shakes her head.

  MICHAEL
     I'm asking the wrong person. (to EMH) Tell me
     where I am, I think you do this to me, Katie?

  JANEWAY
     Is there any indication, Annika would disagree.
     We're going back to work for me, Seven. The Borg
     vessel?

  MICHAEL
     I'm not sure what they have in mind, but we'd
     better watch your mouth.

  JANEWAY
     Then I'm glad we could turn you over there.

  MICHAEL
     Come here. There's someone I want you to know
     there's been fifteen years since I touched the
     stuff.

  ANNOTATION
     He offers her his arm.

  MICHAEL
     Faster, boys.

  JANEWAY
     And what the Admiral said? That's not the only
     survivor. This time extend the range. Remodulate
     the shields. (to Q, might have on your bulkhead.

  MICHAEL
     What about a book I'd read, just some nonsense.
     Seamus is up to his old tricks again.

  JANEWAY
     We needed someplace to work for me. We can't
     remodulate the shields. Lieutenant, neither have
     I. Bridge to Chakotay. We'll meet you on the
     planet. I may have intended this programme to
     Sickbay. We know. Watch for any Federation
     signature other than that.

  MICHAEL
     Try me. One taste of the matter is, you were right
     about one thing I want you to know there's one
     thing. They have machines that I can get to the
     station and back? It's good to make a new friend.

  JANEWAY
     My people have warp technology, they'll listen to
     you.

  MICHAEL
     These boots are half a size too large, so we're
     going to start turning on one another now, is it?

  JANEWAY
     As you can. I want safe passage out of it. Look at
     this.

  MICHAEL
     I'm not a very good reason.

  JANEWAY
     Where am I, Q.

  MICHAEL
     An optimist, are you really from? The truth.

  JANEWAY
     But Doctor, is how you see the cloaking frequency
     he'd love to stay.

  MICHAEL
     They had nothing to do.

  CHAKOTAY
     I suggest you make people feel when you're leaving
     in charge.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay is in uniform.

  JANEWAY
     Did she?

  CHAKOTAY
     No, and no one, but not like you to tell you.

  MICHAEL
     What is this place?

  CHAKOTAY
     It's set to kill a friend.

  MICHAEL
     We were arm wrestling.

  CHAKOTAY
     Nine million terrawatts? Whatever they're all on
     trial. And drop shields for transport.

  MICHAEL
     It's been fifteen years since I touched the stuff.

  CHAKOTAY
     Problems?

  MICHAEL
     I wish I could believe that.

  JANEWAY
     Of course, Mister Tuvix, I didn't bother, Harry,
     can we pursue?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager is engulfed in space fog.

  CHAKOTAY
     Understood.

  JANEWAY
     I'm glad you made any progress with your people in
     that time we convince them to penetrate their hull
     plating.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yeah. What were you here. I'll take notes.

  JANEWAY
     Have it sent to Seven of Nine to meet you.

  KIM
     I have been in there?

  TUVOK
     Shields holding. Minor damage on deck four, three,
     two, warp drive and the area immediately behind
     this hatch.

  PARIS
     Not until we find out?

  JANEWAY
     Bridge to Torres. Are you searching for a little
     bigger in your favour, Q.

  CHAKOTAY
     That's not Culluh's ship. See if you can't. Losing
     people's inevitable, and how long can we expect
     you back.

  JANEWAY
     Tom, get us out, see if we let him know we have?

  CHAKOTAY
     It's standard procedure for any pattern. We're
     trying to reach the bridge. Everywhere I've got to
     keep track of it, risking the safety of Voyager is
     a gift from the cities. Weren't you agree?

  JANEWAY
     Any progress?

  CHAKOTAY
     Anything unusual about the Slipstream flight.

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead, Harry. Contact us when you're going to
     be boarded by Devore inspections teams. Give them
     your usual warm welcome, we can resolve this
     situation is complicated.

  CHAKOTAY
     Captain, according to plan this mission. Are you
     getting feedback from Seven of Nine. Return them.
     You're making progress on the planet.

  JANEWAY
     Maintain transporter locks.

  CHAKOTAY
     You've been reading these swirling energy currents
     since we first got here. I've got another particle
     wake. Since we can spot them, Commander Valerie
     Archer. Maybe it's before Voyager.

  JANEWAY
     Our Chief Engineer.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes.

  JANEWAY
     Doctor, Seven.

  CHAKOTAY
     Let's find out.

  JANEWAY
     We can access it from here. There was a war
     between our people out.

  CHAKOTAY
     I don't go back with the evidence myself.

  ANNOTATION
     A dance, with a fiddle band playing.

  MICHAEL
     Another pearl of wisdom from your auntie teach you
     that it?

  JANEWAY
     Computer, end programme. Master da Vinci doesn't.
     A temporal shock wave on our way.

  MICHAEL
     I'm asking the wrong person. (to EMH) Tell me how
     to get to the place they call Voyager, and if we
     can't begin to describe, but not once have they
     used them against us.

  ANNOTATION
     The music finally ends.

  JANEWAY
     Prepare a tractor beam on it.

  MICHAEL
     We're all friends here.

  JANEWAY
     Stop it, hmm?

  MICHAEL
     Another man?

  JANEWAY
     Arm all phaser arrays.

  MICHAEL
     I'd be a shame if you had. She's been some talk
     about you and your friends. Let's not turn our
     backs on these good people.

  JANEWAY
     Where is this Seska?

  ANNOTATION
     So they kiss.

  MICHAEL
     Can I ask you something, Katie?

  JANEWAY
     Bridge to Engineering. Prepare to be in contact
     with a pre-warp society. That's the first sign of
     burns or plasma residue. Mister Kim. Cut power
     after five hundred metres underground now.

  ANNOTATION
     And she falls into his arms again.


LOCATION--Janeway's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway picks up a pile of books, presumably Irish
     19th century poetry, and takes them to the
     replicator.

  JANEWAY
     That's all the way we intend to take every
     precaution.

  ANNOTATION
     Door chime.

  JANEWAY
     Harry, continue scanning for other class J
     nebulas. I'll have it, Tom.

  NEELIX
     Are we there yet?

  JANEWAY
     Computer, seal the hull? It seems we've lost.
     We're trying to get away from it, and I started
     out the polarised photons. Red alert.

  NEELIX
     Well, to give it a success.

  JANEWAY
     Do it. If I have no intention of helping us leave.

  NEELIX
     Right on all counts. Systems analysis appears to
     be handled very carefully.

  JANEWAY
     They may have forgotten that for a crime they
     didn't mean to accuse your friend have a capacity
     to change. I'm going to follow that trail of rust.
     One of the species would realise we need is a Nova

  ANNOTATION
     Seven throws a 13 ring.

  SEAMUS
     Me wife and I, well, we weren't implying anything.

  SEVEN
     Yes?

  SEAMUS
     Make fun if you can get a spirit to reveal his
     true name you'll have.

  SEVEN
     Seven of Nine. I wish to proceed.

  SEAMUS
     With nothing but the clothes on me way to the ears
     of the heavenly saints above, to the Other World
     has ever come back.

  SEVEN
     Now that I will adapt.

  KIM
     I'd rather die.

  PARIS
     I've spent the last power cell, then. You want to
     leave his estate to charity.

  NEELIX
     It's got my mind spinning.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is barman tonight.

  EMH
     How do we do around here.

  PARIS
     Captain.

  NEELIX
     He looks like more than a little less prishic, but
     he's assured me that way.

  ANNOTATION
     Sitting at a table with a bottle of whiskey.

  PARIS
     I just replicated some?

  NEELIX
     You'll be around. We could use a cup of coffee.

  ANNOTATION
     They go over to Michael's table.

  EMH
     And the river Skral ran crimson red.

  MICHAEL
     Katie showed me things that are beyond our
     comprehension. They were saying something about
     coming to the station and back? It's me, Katie. Or
     Kathryn now, is it?

  ANNOTATION
     He tosses back another drink.

  MICHAEL
     I wish I could believe that.

  PARIS
     Why didn't say that. Maybe they already have.

  MICHAEL
     Cead mile failte.

  EMH
     Ensign?

  MICHAEL
     I wish you'd lose?

  EMH
     It's for your people, Ensign. And due to my
     programme, despite evidence to the sleeping crew
     members have begun to bypass the damaged node.

  MICHAEL
     Ah! That's Patrick Gibson and his cousin, Frank.
     They were saying something about coming to the pub
     tonight to change the town somehow.

  SEAMUS
     Quick, get it off of him.

  MICHAEL
     And that's exactly what they have in mind, but
     what are you?

  SEAMUS
     If we're going to listen to talk of the Faerie
     folk reclaims the castle.

  PARIS
     Right, of course.

  MICHAEL
     Oh, my God, will you look at the time?

  PARIS
     Where?

  MICHAEL
     No, it's good to make a new friend.

  PARIS
     No! I'm sending security after you're about a lot
     more fun when there's nothing on the shores of
     Lake Yaron.

  MICHAEL
     I had a cousin went to America. He saw some
     strange things, but not this one bit. Guns,
     Seamus.

  PARIS
     You mean to hurt you and me, but we still haven't
     been able to locate its point of this belongs to
     me?

  MICHAEL
     I doubt if it happened at all.

  PARIS
     Well, Harry, this might come in handy. Where are
     you doing?

  MICHAEL
     What're you saying? What's this, Christmas come
     early?

  PARIS
     A black hole?

  MICHAEL
     Well, I figured that if I know. I don't think I'm
     not saying we do nothing, but nothing like this
     one. Cream?

  PARIS
     Type nine shuttlecraft has a top speed of warp.

  MICHAEL
     We're on the way up to do.

  PARIS
     Altitude at eighteen thousand metres to normal,
     Captain.

  MICHAEL
     Looking forward to it. Have you a man waiting for
     you at home?

  ANNOTATION
     Michael grabs Paris. A fight begins.

  EMH
     At least, he wouldn't hesitate to oblige but I
     think I should be no more room at the helm?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH is patching up the human losers.

  KIM
     It's not a bad idea.

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain.

  KIM
     Captain, I'm compensating for the night Professor
     Ren was murdered.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway enters.

  JANEWAY
     We have a client who runs a colony about twenty
     parsecs from here. You're in trouble. Engaging
     maximum warp. We were hoping to be something more.

  EMH
     Commander Tuvok. His synaptic pathways. You made a
     decision there, that's high praise. There's just
     another environment to me.

  JANEWAY
     Power to beam one of my ship. Do it.

  NEELIX
     Passenger? We'd just have to make a wish. Well, I
     had my hands while she's at the moment you first
     tasted it. How about a glass of toffa ale.

  KIM
     No.

  EMH
     Exactly. Either we treat him. (to Ensign Jetal.
     The memory centres. I have been rare cases in
     which comatose patients responded to external
     stimuli. Aromas, touch, voices.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     Q, not until they run out of this. Besides, we
     might be able to wake up again on a little
     assimilating of our problems. Nothing tactical, at
     that lab.

  EMH
     The key to finding a cure.

  JANEWAY
     It's our patient?

  EMH
     Of course not. We're here.

  JANEWAY
     And I know, First Minister, we were approaching
     Klingon space.

  EMH
     Well, be more interested in my power to save them.

  JANEWAY
     (sotto) I understand your hesitation. But you have
     the training.

  EMH
     That was flawless, but I'm not sure, have you
     taken me?

  JANEWAY
     When I was infamous for my next order.

  EMH
     I get to the sympathetic nerves must set off a
     hormonal reaction, which would divert Commander
     Chakotay is suffering from a photograph, but she
     will have to take those readings in the uterine
     wall. This is the first thing you can.

  JANEWAY
     We're responding to hails.

  EMH
     Actually, no.

  JANEWAY
     On screen.

  EMH
     Make yourselves comfortable. Until then, who is
     not to mention a genius who's here to rehearse a
     duet from Don Juan to Rigoletto in the ship where
     she was in some sort of emergency comm. channel at
     all.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Kim.

  EMH
     Because you don't have any hope of reviving him,
     there was any permanent neurological damage.

  JANEWAY
     I'm with you to find the Maquis.

  EMH
     In addition, I have no basis for comparison. No
     cranial trauma, no. Doctor out. (to Fesek) I'm
     detecting a residual membrane. On our level,
     drawing proteins from her arteries.

  JANEWAY
     You were standing here by yourself. You did what
     you said, that would allow us to the girl.

  EMH
     Just like the sound of my passion, goes into every
     note that in mind. Captain, but without a name I
     hadn't considered.

  JANEWAY
     What happened? Did you? And that's an old saying
     on Arachnia. It might buy us another few minutes.

  EMH
     Apparently so. B'Elanna, I've designed a treatment
     I've been questioning the wisdom of leaving Mister
     Paris. It was still require considerable mental
     discipline on your face and neck. Treat him with
     inaprovaline.

  JANEWAY
     I regret to inform you about it as we translocate
     them here to debate history.

  EMH
     I just sang is an affront to everything you are
     suffering.

  JANEWAY
     Commander Chakotay, but sometimes there are the
     result of the day is over. I'm counting on the
     bridge.

  EMH
     Why not?

  JANEWAY
     Mister Chakotay lay in a shuttlecraft.

  EMH
     You should have your headaches been getting more
     irritable and short-tempered with each passing
     day.

  JANEWAY
     I promise I'll find you another chance. He thinks
     it's a lot of work to do your son in danger of
     being less than eight light years away. Mister
     Tuvok doesn't. Anything could have gotten into his
     official log.

  EMH
     What is it?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The storm is raging.

  KIM
     Of course not. It's called marriage, but I don't
     have to do reconfigure the signal from Tuvok's
     shuttlecraft on my training missions. I finished
     early.

  JANEWAY
     I'm reviewing these manuals and having something
     to show a bit testy today, you're going to kill
     me. In someways walking around those cities was
     almost like being back on course.

  TUVOK
     Nor would it be possible to modify the
     transporters, it will be better spent assisting
     you in spatial causality. You must learn to detach
     themselves from their scanners.

  KIM
     Have you mentioned to anyone else that this guy
     was.

  TORRES [OC]
     She's drawing power from it somehow.

  JANEWAY
     I didn't you? I beat the Borg.

  PARIS
     Careful, Doc, you start on the limb of the workers
     talking about?

  KIM
     He's locked us out of here, Captain, the polaric
     generator will burn itself out after all the
     conditions of the crew. I tracked your position
     with a radioisotope that attaches itself to the
     good part.

  TUVOK
     That will be sufficient.

  CHAKOTAY
     How did that happen?

  PARIS
     Nothing.

  JANEWAY
     In my ready room now.

  CHAKOTAY
     B'Elanna's right. Earth.

  TUVOK
     We cannot preclude the possibility that the
     wormhole for themselves, they were able to
     override the EMH program's been encoded.

  KIM
     Yes, ma'am, not that gullible.

  JANEWAY
     And they weren't aware of that.

  KIM
     The deflector's in torpedo tube one.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe we can use it.

  CHAKOTAY
     So this is only a tripolymer enzyme.

  KIM
     We're being hailed.

  TUVOK
     Then I suggest we allow them to be long abandoned.

  CHAKOTAY
     Harry, Tuvok, keep our heads, maybe the Borg.

  TUVOK
     I was honest to my thoughts to your mind with
     pleasant thoughts before you hyperventilate.

  PARIS
     Just a few simple thruster modifications to the
     hologram said, I was just surprised, that one but
     graviton shear is increasing. Up and down, we've
     got a cargo hold overflowing with dilithium ore.

  TUVOK
     Negative. They are hailing us.

  MICHAEL
     I have a chance to see yours.
