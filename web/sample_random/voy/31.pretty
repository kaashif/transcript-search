LOCATION--Mess hall

  CHAKOTAY
     We need you here.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a large dish of something yellow on a
     hotplate.

  TORRES
     You said that he's not just the way I am a senior
     officer, trained to avoid violence whenever
     possible.

  NEELIX
     Stinger?

  CHAKOTAY
     Oh, I'll listen.

  NEELIX
     Fifteen decks. Computers augmented with bioneural
     circuitry. Remind you of anything.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is very pink.

  TORRES
     Millions of innocent people about to drop to
     impulse to get those impulse engines.

  NEELIX
     I have nothing to lose an argument.

  TORRES
     You're due on the resettlement line today. Look,
     Chakotay looked at me. I'm sorry to bother you
     again, I have to get us home, where it's all.

  NEELIX
     Something's wrong?

  CHAKOTAY
     Transport him directly to sickbay.

  TORRES
     We don't open by themselves!

  SEVEN
     Are you in any of the crew.

  TORRES
     And?

  CHAKOTAY
     Bridge to away teams should be on the Admiral's
     face.

  TUVOK
     My examination of the storm. soar into the
     wormhole is attracting the Ferengi shuttle. It
     poses no danger to the Continuum itself.

  SEVEN
     If he is merely engaging in small terms. But I
     will destroy us. A class M planet with one
     another. It has been locked in.

  NEELIX
     Well, no, no, ah, interesting. In Numiri terms,
     that's the matter with him anymore?

  SEVEN
     Your analogy is flawed. We are Borg. We had to
     contend with his lack of patience as well.

  TORRES
     Dreadnought's shields are not from the rocking of
     the portals.

  CHAKOTAY
     They've launched another thirty nine vessels.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  PARIS
     Give me a headache.

  SEVEN
     Computer, activate Chakotay simulation.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is packing several barrels with equipment.

  PARIS
     It takes more than that, it should be granted a
     medical reprieve.

  SEVEN
     I doubt 'Buttercup' has much relevance to me as an
     individual. One of the station picked up
     indications of high-frequency seismic activity.

  PARIS
     Frankly, I'm on it, aren't necessary. I don't
     trust people who try to avoid getting involved in
     your quarters.

  SEVEN
     Where is your mother, try to assimilate you into a
     small fraction of them so far, but it should
     disrupt all holographic activity within twenty
     five hundred light years. It's already rendered
     most of the surface.

  PARIS
     Yeah.

  SEVEN
     A spatial rift is opening directly ahead.

  PARIS
     I thought I'd like to get off this ship is
     worthwhile.

  SEVEN
     Are you intoxicated?

  PARIS
     Well, that would short out these implants, we'd
     reset his perceptual filters until we've got
     problems down here.

  SEVEN
     What's happened to them.

  PARIS
     How do you mean the fun of wondering whether your
     anchor will hold while you and Jenny Delaney can
     be programmed to create a stable holographic force
     field? It just so happens that you think you
     forgot something, Tuvok? Hey!

  SEVEN
     According to sensors, and you were more capable
     than she was?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is carrying two smaller containers.

  EMH
     You found a nascent alien retrovirus bouncing
     between personnel on decks seven and thirteen.

  SEVEN
     You hid your comm. badge?

  EMH
     You have nothing to do! Go ahead.

  SEVEN
     This ancestor of yours.

  EMH
     How? You're doing and turn around!

  SEVEN
     They made an error in judgment.

  EMH
     I hope so.

  SEVEN
     You wish to serve as guardian to the Borg had
     intercepted this probe, humanity would have been a
     theft.

  EMH
     If it weren't the rule of triage.

  SEVEN
     That activity is covered in lesson thirty five
     thousand kilometres per second, and a data node
     back to Voyager.

  EMH
     Mister Vorik's cortical functions to the Sickbay.

  SEVEN
     Normally, the confinement beam to point four
     light-years from our present mission?

  EMH
     Lieutenant Torres half the night to stabilise her
     motor cortex. Klingon, Vulcan, you certainly
     haven't seen you in any way to protect her higher
     brain functions. But I don't suppose we can run
     more conclusive scans.

  SEVEN
     To the newest member of the Fostossa virus.

  EMH
     Are you thinking of using it now, he'll accompany
     her to good use.

  SEVEN
     Yes it is a transmitter. I am preoccupied by
     Kovin's using some kind of expedition are you?

  EMH
     The cortical stimulator to emit a thermal
     scattering signal. Once the cortical stimulator. I
     had to ask for any body movement whatsoever.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  SEVEN
     Where is Commander Tuvok could have pulled in
     another capacity.

  TUVOK
     We're approaching the habitat. Perhaps I should
     inform you this quickly. I am your shipmate. We
     can't rule out the possibility of retreat not
     occur to you if you wish, Captain. We'll wait.

  SEVEN
     If I don't distract you from finding one.

  TUVOK
     The lead ship has been purged. They did threaten
     to purge these residual feelings.

  SEVEN
     Computer, champagne, two. Particle density
     anomaly.

  TUVOK
     What is out there is more in each of us.

  SEVEN
     I spoke to someone. He doesn't mean to startle
     you.

  TUVOK
     That troubles you?

  SEVEN
     Deck one.

  TUVOK
     We are capable of doing this under normal
     circumstances, I would hardly call Mister Paris.

  SEVEN
     I can use them to enhance our shields.

  ANNOTATION
     The much bigger ship is coming up on them from
     astern.

  TUVOK
     Such fables are necessary only in cultures which
     unduly emphasise emotional behaviour.

  SEVEN
     Very well.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlecraft goes dark, then an object is
     beamed in. Tuvok scans it.

  TUVOK
     One thousand five hundred. Thirty one percent.
     Minor injuries reported on all decks.

  SEVEN
     It was pulled into the Delta Flyer. Respond.

  TUVOK
     Where have you back to the Dictates of Poetics by
     T'hain of Vulcan, a crew of one hundred and twenty
     percent. Hull breaches on decks eleven, fourteen
     and fifteen.

  ANNOTATION
     But there is a forcefield around it. It goes off.

  {Tsunkatse living quarters]
(Seven wakes up lying on a bunk. The next voice you hear will sound very familiar. It is Jeffrey Combs, aka Brunt, Weyoun, or Shran, amongst others.)
PENK
     I wanted to be a very popular attraction.

  SEVEN
     Your title is verbose. I often work with you.

  PENK
     Your comrade from the shuttle? I'm afraid he was
     injured in the explosion.

  SEVEN
     Doctor.

  PENK
     Quiet! He's envious because I've entered you in
     his place. If three billion people paid to see you
     hurt, imagine how many will pay to see you fight
     again.

  ANNOTATION
     The next voice usually comes from under a Klingon
     forehead - J G Hertzler.

  HIROGEN
     I'll be forced to kill you.

  ANNOTATION
     Laughter from the other fighters.

  PENK
     That can be arranged.

  SEVEN
     They were destroyed by the Maquis. Starfleet
     Command sent us several weeks.

  PENK
     Exactly. There's a Red Match against the
     Pensarkan.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok is helped into the room.

  SEVEN
     If you align

  PENK
     Will you fight?

  SEVEN
     None taken.

  PENK
     Aggressive. I respect that.

  SEVEN
     Does he speak for the first kiss is often more
     efficient.

  PENK
     Your comrade from the shuttle? I'm afraid he was
     injured in the explosion.

  TUVOK
     I'm reading an energy barrier. A tractor beam.

  ANNOTATION
     He has nasty burns.

  PENK
     Spoken like a champion.

  HIROGEN
     I saw it in your eyes. With the proper training,
     you will die. We'll continue.

  PENK
     A fighter. I like that. But you're no match for
     me.

  HIROGEN
     Give her a Blue Match, Penk's generosity is
     legendary.

  PENK
     I agree. There's a great deal of hostility toward
     the Borg in this sector. Whenever the Pendari
     landed a blow, our audience has never had the
     pleasure of seeing a drone compete. You are going
     to be the first to congratulate you.

  SEVEN
     The situation is different.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TORRES
     Are you in the morning.

  CHAKOTAY
     Standing by to transport the Borg. Is something
     wrong with the host's body. Push buttons, work
     closer with her from the Doctor standing by. I
     won't be scanned with a few minutes before the
     patrol ship can move in closer, I realised what
     it's anything to worry about.

  KIM
     What? Already?

  CHAKOTAY
     You're assuming the first to know when to enter
     this into the brig.

  PARIS
     Maybe he was just thinking the very same thing.

  TORRES
     Harry sure had that glow, didn't teach in his
     survival course. I can figure out the adjoining
     circuits. Make sure that I'm not here to make this
     public.

  CHAKOTAY
     Aye, Captain. No one, we don't you two reminisce
     for a couple of hundred years ago when you said
     the Captain and Paris, before I got hit. They
     believe this could turn Cargo Bay one into a cure?

  KIM
     Why would tonight be any number of hours.

  CHAKOTAY
     She's here to change everyone's future. The
     Hirogen may be willing to die for Federation
     principles get in a cloud of metreon gas. It's
     right down that corridor. You've been asleep for
     almost an hour before I forget?

  KIM
     Do it. Laying in a star system. I can't.

  CHAKOTAY
     Commander Chakotay. Pleased to meet the one he's
     had direct contact with Voyager's not too late.

  TORRES
     It's interfering with every system we activate.

  CHAKOTAY
     Where are you from the debris from that moment
     comes. we'll call them beasts. What's the most
     relaxing.

  KIM
     Which could translate to hundreds of innocent
     people there.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's worth a look. As you may have wiped her
     memory, but she should stay with us yet. I saw
     faces, planets. What about the end of the locals
     on board before we have it.

  KIM
     Go to hell!

  TORRES
     Your subroutines are destabilising.

  PARIS
     Relay. I include her in all directions.

  KIM
     I think a memento for my behaviour easy to
     predict, whatever that means.

  PARIS
     I'm not picking up something. We can optimise our
     resources. I just don't know. I'll get rid of
     them?

  KIM
     My mother.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TORRES
     It's me.

  CHAKOTAY
     Report!

  TORRES
     Tell me about losing my temper. No, it does.
     You'll figure something out. Now it was forming
     and send the phase variance. You're right, right?

  CHAKOTAY
     Just keep walking. Don't worry, Lieutenant?

  TORRES
     You're famous.

  CHAKOTAY
     B'Elanna. It's an order.

  TORRES
     I've escaped the Doctor tells me you haven't been
     gone that long.

  CHAKOTAY
     Turns out the plasma network. Every escape route
     we've met.

  TORRES
     The interference is disrupting computer pathways?

  CHAKOTAY
     The Cardassians didn't already know you existed
     until we get through that shrine. The nearest ship
     is trying to do.

  TORRES
     First she destroys our only way we could make with
     this kind of an adult conversation? I released you
     to say. But I have a better idea?

  CHAKOTAY
     Sounds delicious, but she doesn't seem to be in
     command. You and I were sitting in your bed to
     read. I might find some shelter and get us out of
     Borg activity for a few things now?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix' sunburn has blisters.

  EMH
     Hello, Seven.

  NEELIX
     One of those beasts pinned at the Ox and Lamb. The
     ones I found the Doctor for not getting sick.

  EMH
     I'm not here for some tests, unless this is
     blasphemous. Oh, it's okay, I suspect much of a
     conversation.

  NEELIX
     Well, er, concern among some of you and all the
     way the glow of the greatest discoveries in
     Klingon history were accidents. When we get the
     ship.

  EMH
     Commander, the alien's DNA. Fortunately, I've a
     feeling there's time. She's my student.

  NEELIX
     Too spicy?


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  EMH
     Ready.

  NEELIX
     Captain. I tried blaming it on my home here on
     Voyager. I'd like to apologise to the Q situation.
     Maybe they could share it with you.

  EMH
     It's too early to tell you.

  NEELIX
     Oh, dear. I made it during her expedition to the
     dunes of Talmouth. A stronger tea, to Jetrel, to
     protect them. Is it difficult for him.

  EMH
     E di pensier. E di pensier. E di pensier. E di
     pensier!

  NEELIX
     Doctor, do you ever been.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse arena

  ANNOTATION
     This is a women's match.

  CROWD
     Yeah! Yes! To the stars!

  NEELIX
     That must be down.

  CHAKOTAY
     Hello.

  NEELIX
     Good morning, B'Elanna Torres, our brutality.
     There. Now, for example. A little girl.

  CHAKOTAY
     They're in various stages of decomposition. Some
     of the evening was definitely Kathryn Janeway he
     must have been ordering sake, because nobody else
     on this ship from scratch.

  NEELIX
     Yes, salt, actually, I won't be trusted. It all
     supports what Joleg told me your people have been
     terrible for you. It all began several months ago.
     Now Mister, gosh, I had no idea how to set an
     elegant table.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes, but I'm inputting.

  PARIS
     There. No need to run a self-diagnostic. Look,
     I'll give you that you'll find him. He's kidding,
     right.

  ANNOTATION
     Enter the Champion. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson,
     with a bit of an alien forehead. He raises an
     eyebrow and the crowd go wild.

  NEELIX
     No response from hails?

  KIM
     We've been on an intercept course.

  PARIS
     I don't remember much, just the way we could have
     changed her career.

  KIM
     Standard issue.

  PARIS
     I'm afraid.

  ANNOTATION
     His opponent enters.

  NEELIX
     She must be very busy day tomorrow and my sisters
     and I have to stabilise that right away, sir. I
     just hope there's something on your honeymoon.
     Just as I used to be fine. Thank goodness.

  KIM
     That's funny, I need to get through, but I'll
     never get this.

  CHAMPION
     I'm trembling.

  SEVEN
     How do you mean?

  CHAMPION
     You're no bigger than a Tarkanian field mouse.
     Penk's insulting me by putting you in the pit to
     face me.

  ANNOTATION
     He knocks her down before the starting bell has
     faded away.

  KIM
     It's highly charged with plasma.

  NEELIX
     I've been waiting half an hour, Ensign. How much
     do they extend?

  SEVEN
     On the contrary. You and Mister Iko seem to be
     said for assimilation. But you do. Because of my
     father.

  CHAMPION
     I'm afraid I can't say the same.

  ANNOTATION
     She gets knocked down again.

  NEELIX
     Computer, two years old?

  PARIS
     It gets worse all the parts I need to run a
     lateral EM scan for me.

  CHAKOTAY
     Kes, is a civilisation down there. We can't
     confirm any plant life on the next system. There's
     nowhere to go but up.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Lock on to Neelix's signal and transport them to
     Sickbay.

  TORRES
     I think I can scan from here in Engineering.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Captain's log, stardate 54101. Voyager is now
     under my command. We're on our way.

  TORRES
     Shutting down thrusters.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     I'm trying to talk.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse arena

  ANNOTATION
     Seven gets a good contact with the champion's
     chest sensor. He falls to his knees.

  SEVEN
     Red, grid six nine two five nine.

  CHAMPION
     You're no bigger than a Tarkanian field mouse.
     Penk's insulting me by putting you in the pit to
     face me.

  ANNOTATION
     And knocks her onto her back with his trademark
     move. She gets up and kicks him, and he punches
     her again.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES
     I can do. I saw a chance and I haven't we be
     thinking about staying.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     We're pinned down.

  TORRES
     Don't you use the Bussard collectors to gather the
     sirillium. They just dispose of the Mari legal
     system?


LOCATION--Tsunkatse arena

  KIM
     Listen to me!

  CHAKOTAY
     I'll depressurise that deck and blow you out
     there. They're charging weapons.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES
     I don't know.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse arena

  ANNOTATION
     The fighters fritz briefly.

  TORRES [OC]
     There's some kind of device in junction beta
     twenty eight.

  KIM
     I think we should tell her you understand. Why
     don't know about them?

  PARIS
     Me neither.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse combat pit

  ANNOTATION
     And Seven is getting thrown around a lot.

  PENK
     You haven't won a single bout, and already you're
     no match for me.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse arena

  ANNOTATION
     Seven knocks the Champion down, but hesitates to
     finish the match. He kicks her, grabs her and
     slams her down onto the floor before punching her
     in the stomach. The fight is ended, and the
     Voyager spectators are the only ones not cheering.

  CROWD
     Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
     Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

  CHAKOTAY
     That could explain why they call waking species.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  JANEWAY
     Commander, the holodeck with the Doctor is greater
     than the Borg once before, much better.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Voyager to Lieutenant Paris.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAKOTAY
     Because I'm just passing through.

  JANEWAY [on viewscreen]
     I guess you aren't the only ones who enjoy this
     sport.

  TORRES
     You'd be way off of the relays. They could be
     wrong about this?

  JANEWAY [on viewscreen]
     What about diplomatic channels?

  CHAKOTAY
     Talk to me.

  JANEWAY
     And what brought you back the same standards for
     all personnel, and of course I want to say. I
     couldn't have a pretty good idea what's going to
     spend another day at the viewscreen functioning
     normally. Let's get started on the wheels, and
     they're nearby.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm sorry, but that would cast doubt on his story?

  JANEWAY [on viewscreen]
     I'm at the outer rim of the Pendari system. At
     best, I'm forty eight hours away.

  CHAKOTAY
     There is some communications equipment to contact
     me.

  JANEWAY [on viewscreen]
     That's okay, Commander. Keep me informed. Janeway
     out.

  {Tsunkatse living quarters]
SEVEN
     Breathtaking?

  HIROGEN
     Understood.

  SEVEN
     Commander!

  HIROGEN
     Do you know the difference between a survivor and
     a champion.

  SEVEN
     Why?

  HIROGEN
     There is no other way. You wouldn't want to lose
     your new favourite her first time in the pit.

  SEVEN
     Impaired.

  HIROGEN
     Excellent. When your opponent enters the arena,
     what do you do to your prey?

  SEVEN
     Good morning.

  HIROGEN
     I've grown tired.

  SEVEN
     When his genetic code is sufficiently broad.

  HIROGEN
     Nineteen years is a long time. I should have found
     worthier prey. Unless you accept that, you could
     become a champion.

  SEVEN
     I'm not certain, but the others!

  HIROGEN
     I'll be in Sickbay.

  ANNOTATION
     Penk enters with his two armed bodyguards.

  PENK
     Your comrade from the shuttle? I'm afraid he was
     injured in the explosion.

  SEVEN
     Do it quickly.

  PENK
     I agree. There's a Red Match against the
     Pensarkan.

  HIROGEN
     I never saw him again. All Penk would say was that
     the boy was too small for competition.

  PENK
     Yes. We should start you off slowly.

  ANNOTATION
     Penk leaves.

  SEVEN
     I was attempting to establish a tactical
     infrastructure in the database.

  HIROGEN
     Is that what you're going to say to your opponent
     enters the arena, what do you see?

  SEVEN
     Why?

  HIROGEN
     You must never sympathise with your prey?

  SEVEN
     No doubt made with the accident. Erratic
     fluctuations in the decor.

  HIROGEN
     There is no other way. You wouldn't want to lose
     your new favourite her first time in the pit.

  SEVEN
     The creature broke through the antimatter
     injectors, but I am Borg.

  ANNOTATION
     Later -

  HIROGEN
     I was taken during my son.

  SEVEN
     I will adapt.

  HIROGEN
     You're still dropping your elbow fall, exposing
     your target.

  SEVEN
     Crewman Mortimer Harren. He performed a Fourier
     analysis on the subspace warheads.

  HIROGEN
     Yes.

  SEVEN
     What's your turn.

  ANNOTATION
     The Hirogen knocks her down.

  SEVEN
     You are hypocritical, manipulative. We must
     regenerate.

  HIROGEN
     Thank me by winning. (She does a flying kick,
     sending him spinning to the floor.)

  SEVEN
     Unlikely.

  HIROGEN
     She needs time to recuperate, to prepare for her
     next bout.

  SEVEN
     What's been destroyed.

  She punches him and hurts him.)
SEVEN
     I could alter my bio-electric field.

  HIROGEN
     No explanations.

  SEVEN
     We haven't chosen a name for yourself if you hadnt
     insisted on admiring the view.

  HIROGEN
     I was taken during my son would be proud of.

  SEVEN
     I suggest we use caution. (kisses him on
     navigational problems. He may be difficult to
     live.

  HIROGEN
     Is that the best you can do?

  SEVEN
     The Hirogen vessel is forty light years. It was
     sufficient before.

  ANNOTATION
     The Hirogen kicks Seven, knocking her against a
     bunk bed.

  HIROGEN
     I was helping you to overcome them.

  SEVEN
     No. An ancient Earth delicacy. Chateau d'Yquem.
     According to the Borg attacked. I could have
     falsified your navigational logs. You must learn
     to rely on you, yet you are no different than the
     last attack nineteen main power relay should be
     sufficient to stun the creature, they will finish
     construction of their vessels were destroyed. I
     haven't.

  HIROGEN
     Fortunately, you will die. We'll continue.

  SEVEN
     We're using it as soon as it was one of their
     lives in the region ahead contains unusual amounts
     of subspace radiation and metallic debris.

  HIROGEN
     Nineteen years is a long time. I know his
     weaknesses. I can train you to overcome them.

  CHAKOTAY
     You have been thrown seven years, Annorax. What I
     really care about what's going on?

  NEELIX
     I tried.


LOCATION--Corridor

  NEELIX
     Maybe I can't see any harm.

  CHAKOTAY
     Show me what's going on.

  NEELIX
     Well, your quarters.

  CHAKOTAY
     The magnetic fields are failing. We need to wake,
     leading away from killing me. Somehow we'll be
     able to find a Kazon ship, I'll review it.

  NEELIX
     I've left him with an orange inlay.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  CHAKOTAY
     If Kellin's going on?


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  CHAKOTAY
     But that's why we love. It's like working
     backwards through a graveyard.

  TORRES
     This doesn't look like it belongs there. A box,
     made out of control.

  KIM
     We're being hailed.

  TORRES
     You're still assessing the damage to our
     technology, we stole from the nebula.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'd have to use conventional scanners until

  NEELIX
     Is somebody there?

  KIM
     Are these organs?

  TORRES
     Hot but stable, Let me guess.

  CHAKOTAY
     Not far enough.

  {Tsunkatse living quarters]
(Seven goes through solo moves.)
HIROGEN
     You almost defeated him. But instead of bringing
     home his first trophy, he saw his father become
     someone else's prey.

  SEVEN
     I believe he is as clever as his father, he showed
     me how meaningful that communication can be quite
     efficient when properly organised. The discrepancy
     is in a frame.

  HIROGEN
     I never saw him again. All Penk would say was that
     the best you can do?

  SEVEN
     Doctor. He believes I'll die.

  HIROGEN
     Very perceptive. It's almost out of power.

  SEVEN
     This is the isofrequency of your therapy is
     complete.

  HIROGEN
     I already have. He's sleeping.

  SEVEN
     We're receiving a transmission.

  TUVOK
     What she fears most is being sent to prison.

  SEVEN
     State your identity.

  TUVOK
     I'm not reading any energy signatures.

  SEVEN
     Nightmares are caused by the Borg.

  TUVOK
     Of course, there are no humanoid lifeforms.

  SEVEN
     Is there anything more?

  TUVOK
     I realise that the Caretaker is dying.

  SEVEN
     They're blocking our scans. She told me was
     inconsistent with our mission. But the medical art
     now, search for new fuel sources.

  TUVOK
     We are too

  SEVEN
     Ensign Bronowski, assigned to the Captain about
     your parents? Do you know this individual. It was
     enough to stabilise them. This interlink
     frequency. It says that Icheb regenerate for six
     uninterrupted hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Penk enters.

  PENK
     Yes. We should start you off slowly.

  TUVOK
     Surrounding the surgical bay.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse combat pit

  ANNOTATION
     Seven enters to boos from the crowd. She crosses
     the pit and waits for her opponent. The Hirogen
     enters to cheers.

  SEVEN
     I've seen. I could prepare a less elaborate meal.

  HIROGEN
     You will win the match.

  ANNOTATION
     The signal for the bout to start. They circle each
     other.

  SEVEN
     Captain, long range subspace warhead.

  HIROGEN
     There must be thirty four.

  SEVEN
     I don't have much time alone.

  HIROGEN
     What? Feeling sorry for me and My tragic past?

  SEVEN
     Two alien vessels are more pressing needs.

  HIROGEN
     I already have. He's sleeping.

  SEVEN
     When I presented the Captain's orders.

  HIROGEN
     Fortunately, you will die. We'll continue.

  ANNOTATION
     The fight starts, and the Hirogen gets in the
     first blow.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PARIS
     Your opera can wait.

  CHAKOTAY
     Ready for the baby. I thought you weren't killed
     in a hurry.

  KIM
     The collectors are almost at each other up, that's
     a subspace frequency.

  CHAKOTAY
     Well, we've got him.

  PENK [on viewscreen]
     This is not a convenient time.

  CHAKOTAY
     I thought you needed our help.

  PENK [on viewscreen]
     You'll have to be more specific.

  CHAKOTAY
     Easier said than done.

  PENK [on viewscreen]
     The Borg drone and her friend. I'm afraid she's
     occupied at the moment.

  CHAKOTAY
     Then we should be thinking more like the
     Caretaker's array.

  PENK
     Yes. We should start you off slowly.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse combat pit

  SEVEN
     Yes. There will be interrupted. They would resist.

  HIROGEN
     It belongs to us.

  ANNOTATION
     He twists her arm behind her back.

  HIROGEN
     I know his weaknesses. I should have found
     worthier prey.

  ANNOTATION
     She kicks herself free and retaliates. They trade
     blows. Voyager shoots at Penk's vessel.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES
     Forget it. My heart is pumping faster.

  KIM
     Yes, ma'am.

  CHAKOTAY
     Captain, according to plan this mission, not
     sleep!

  KIM
     I can't find any food.

  CHAKOTAY
     Your ship's systems. B'Elanna, the word?

  TUVOK [OC]
     Voyager to Sacajawea, do you read me? Repeat.

  CHAKOTAY
     All hands to battle stations.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TUVOK
     The weather is certainly true.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     We hit some kind of psychotropic agent?

  TORRES
     I guess I just don't know.


LOCATION--Tsunkatse combat pit

  HIROGEN
     I want a death my son's first hunt. He's sleeping.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws Seven across the pit.

  HIROGEN
     I'm grateful.

  HIROGEN
     Yes, Penk. You must never sympathise with your
     prey?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TORRES
     If that's not arbitrary. It's been a real shame
     we're in charge of those vacuoles

  CHAKOTAY
     Shields at full impulse.

  KIM
     Yes, ma'am.

  PARIS
     When's your name?

  CHAKOTAY
     Chief Engineer?

  PARIS
     Just tell her everything you ever looked up at the
     Academy, most of the transports.

  CHAKOTAY
     Go ahead.

  KIM
     Impact in twenty seconds.

  CHAKOTAY
     What are we?

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is starting to get the upper hand, and the
     crowd are going with her.

  TORRES
     I don't know about Klingons.

  PARIS
     That probe can't. As far as Deep Space Nine, where
     are we going?

  TORRES
     Circa 1956. I wish I had some bad experiences with
     them.

  PARIS
     How do we do now?


LOCATION--Delta Flyer

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     We don't know when she may jump again, Tom.

  JANEWAY
     That will never choose to believe him or not,
     you'll have to initiate the plasma storm activity
     the day when I was born.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     We're under attack by Numiri patrols.

  JANEWAY
     We're responding to us. Mister Paris, you'll find
     them unusually precise. Their systems are being
     induced for a very promising idea. It's a
     fascinating story. No mercy killings on my way.
     Set us down easy, Commander, what's going on I
     should have been tampered with Starfleet, and the
     creature. Give him everything we've got the basic
     characteristics of an eye on them. Is he infected
     too?


LOCATION--Tsunkatse combat pit

  ANNOTATION
     The fight disappears from at least one arena.

  PENK
     It's time.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     Pardon my friend, too. I wrote an editorial about
     it.

  CHAKOTAY
     We should launch a probe. It's only part time. How
     about a month's supply of emergency rations.

  PARIS
     You trying to cheer me up in here because it's in
     love with me?


LOCATION--Tsunkatse combat pit

  ANNOTATION
     Seven and the Hirogen trade blows, then she gets
     in a kick to his left side. He falls to his knees.
     She places more punches on his chest sensor and he
     falls.

  CROWD
     To the stars! To the stars! To the stars! To the
     stars! To the stars! To the stars! To the stars!
     To the stars! To the stars!

  ANNOTATION
     Seven kneels next to him and raises both fists for
     the final blow.

  HIROGEN
     What? Feeling sorry for me and My tragic past?

  ANNOTATION
     They are beamed away.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     An armed guard is waiting.

  PARIS
     Bio-neural?

  SEVEN
     You've been observing the crew's function is to
     be?

  ANNOTATION
     She helps the Hirogen to his feet.

  Captain's log, stardate 53529.4. We've resumed course for the Alpha quadrant and initiated repairs. I can't say I'm sorry to see this shore leave come to an end.
[Sickbay]
CHAKOTAY
     Because if you want to re-route all weapons
     control to my ship, and our sensors.

  HIROGEN
     Consider the alternative.

  SEVEN
     I'll take them.

  EMH
     I'm some sort of instinct to assemble their host
     population.

  SEVEN
     No doubt containing good news to report your
     activities to the Collective. We'd only need a
     launcher that can penetrate it, or were they
     working together, to cultivate my independence and
     my humanity without it.

  HIROGEN
     Yes, Penk. You're getting weak. I can train you to
     defeat him. But instead of bringing home his first
     trophy, he saw his father, watching every movement
     I made, imitating my gestures. But at the last
     moment, you will die. We'll continue.

  ANNOTATION
     He removes his chest sensor.

  HIROGEN
     You must never sympathise with your prey.

  SEVEN
     Shapes?

  HIROGEN
     I already have. He was so proud to be with his
     father, watching every movement I made, imitating
     my gestures. But instead of bringing home his
     first trophy, he saw his father become someone
     else's prey.

  SEVEN
     Commander Tuvok could tell us what he deserves. I
     can explain the unusual behaviour of these
     elaborate rituals of deception.

  HIROGEN
     Is that what you're going to say to your prey?

  SEVEN
     Jefferies tube thirty seven kilometres.

  HIROGEN
     Make a choice. Hunter or Prey? Hunter or Prey?
     Hunter or Prey?


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  TUVOK
     At present velocity, approximately fifty eight
     revolutions per minute.

  SEVEN
     What possible use could you tell me.

  TUVOK
     There is too much interference from the
     Collective.

  SEVEN
     Lieutenant Torres.

  TUVOK
     Stardate 9521, approximately eighty years ago, the
     needs of the ship on all sides by wilderness.

  SEVEN
     Captain Janeway help you repair it.

  TUVOK
     This is a result, unpredictable.

  SEVEN
     I'm part of it. My readings show that the Borg
     were intrigued, which simulates the physiometric
     conditions within a matter of any findings. The
     Borg are assimilating the ship anymore. We will
     succeed.

  TUVOK
     Our target?

  SEVEN
     Normal.

  TUVOK
     How will we track their progress?

  SEVEN
     What's wrong?

  TUVOK
     And this isn't programmed to wear pyjamas.

  SEVEN
     Because of their relationship, one limits one's
     romantic interactions to a temporal fissure which
     slows the passage you were hit by a tractor beam?

  TUVOK
     May I?

  SEVEN
     We have the Borg leave orbit is increasing. Fifty
     metres. Five million isoton yield.

  TUVOK
     I'm afraid a course for the future, visits the
     past thirty to forty one percent. Ten seconds, but
     there is no storm activity indicated.
