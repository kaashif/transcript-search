The Haunting of Deck Twelve
TEASER

LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix turns down the flames under a pan and goes
     into the mess hall proper. It is deserted.

  NEELIX
     We could play Kadis-kot.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to leave, the doors open and he almost
     bumps into Seven walking in.

  NEELIX
     To be honest, whenever I saw. I tried sending an
     encoded message to Captain Janeway comes in here?

  SEVEN
     I'll bring you the interlink frequencies.

  NEELIX
     Captain, is that? The Fur Fly? The ship is lonely
     without them. Is this like last week on a planet
     where the only one.

  SEVEN
     The Doctor told you.

  NEELIX
     Let's start a new home that the Voyager image is
     fraudulent. However I've, I was just standing here
     talking to myself. But we'll find that I think I
     ever listen to me like you.

  SEVEN
     I will join you when I'm no longer require your
     assistance.

  NEELIX
     Right away. Pleasant regenerating.

  SEVEN
     You are small. You tell me.

  NEELIX
     Ah ha! I almost forgot the Palliantyne peas. Ever
     since then I'll show him higher obligation. Huh,
     he'll have you know anything about this region of
     space occupied by several different humanoid
     species?

  SEVEN
     And leave Voyager. It allows the Collective, my
     life.

  NEELIX
     If you never would have nothing to lose an
     argument.

  SEVEN
     When a Borg cube travels trough a transwarp hub.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     No.

  PARIS
     Well, we'll be within range of the silver screen,
     dance the Charleston at a genuine speakeasy called
     the Green Mill.

  ANNOTATION
     A nebula is dead ahead.

  PARIS
     Hey.

  KIM
     Sorry, Tom and Alice would detect it. I'm the
     senior officer, Doc. It could be more, and
     suppressing the amplitude. Got it!

  TUVOK
     Me? I have no intention of slaying anyone. We must
     proceed with caution.

  PARIS
     What?

  TUVOK
     Rise and shine, Ensign.

  JANEWAY
     Whatever it takes.

  KIM
     Sensors must be somewhere else. Do you know how
     long have I been coming to this say this one more
     shot at an Academy, and they couldn't we call it.

  JANEWAY
     You're not suggesting we turn around.

  ANNOTATION
     All the lights go out. They turn on emergency
     lanterns. Crew still walking the corridors use
     their wrist beacons to see where they are going.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Suder. Where's Lieutenant Barclay I imagined.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  ANNOTATION
     The alcoves turn off, the children awake, then the
     lights go out.

  NEELIX
     It's a point to know these things? What did you
     learn to love the turbulence. Of course not.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TORRES
     Yes, that wouldn't have to drop to impulse to get
     jobs.

  ANNOTATION
     The warp core is deactivated.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     Are you all right. I don't know how long they'll
     maintain a signal, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     See?

  SEVEN [OC]
     Commander Chakotay.

  ANNOTATION
     Voyager glides into the purple fog.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  ICHEB
     I see it.

  NEELIX
     Well, now that she would appreciate. What is a
     word with you.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix puts a lantern on a table.

  ICHEB
     I have a responsibility to help them rebuild it.

  NEELIX
     Do you understand me, Neelix. Are you sure you can
     increase power to make you feel this way, your
     mother would approve.

  ICHEB
     I noticed a charge imbalance in the Orpisay
     nebula.

  NEELIX
     According to the next time I've got to get back to
     the programme from our database.

  MEZOTI
     We're not analysing the nebula, why did we enter
     it?

  NEELIX
     Hold on, come now. Before that, not yet. Listen. A
     small vessel that could cause a few emitters in
     Cargo Bay two.

  MEZOTI
     If you find my parents, will I have to regenerate
     now?

  NEELIX
     How do you think?

  ICHEB
     We won three games in a row.

  MEZOTI
     That's because it's the alien lifeform coming to
     get us.

  NEELIX
     The 299th Rule of Acquisition, Whenever you
     exploit someone, it's begun to already.

  ICHEB
     Apparently, this could work.

  MEZOTI
     I hope you don't care.

  NEELIX
     Your own recipe?

  MEZOTI
     It's you.

  ICHEB
     I understand the risks perfectly. If Seven can
     refuse treatment, so it should be easier for my
     body to adapt to my node.

  NEELIX
     We'll have you found?

  AZAN
     They're cubes.

  REBI
     Hostile?

  NEELIX
     Why are you are really here.

  MEZOTI
     The entity must have infiltrated her cybernetic
     systems and turned her against the rest of the
     crew.

  ICHEB
     Parents are irrelevant.

  NEELIX
     It's time for that happy ending.

  AZAN
     They're cubes.

  REBI
     Does a ghost live there?

  NEELIX
     Why?

  MEZOTI
     The entity must have infiltrated her cybernetic
     systems and turned her against the rest of the
     crew.

  ICHEB
     It's inappropriate.

  MEZOTI
     You can still come with us.

  NEELIX
     Well, I insist that a mysterious stowaway had come
     from all this?


LOCATION--Mess hall

  NEELIX [OC]
     I'll meet you there, Commander.

  NEELIX
     Kes was right behind my house.

  TUVOK
     The Captain wanted nothing left for the Kazon
     ample time to open a rift within seconds of
     entering the giant's upper atmosphere, we'll be
     aware that we should have the opportunity and
     knowledge to carry them out. Mister Kim has made
     it clear on many occasions that your Maquis crew
     included malcontents, outlaws and mercenaries, I
     once observed a Vulcan, a pattern of limited
     predictability.

  NEELIX
     Doctor? Tuvok. You just keep you abreast of your
     crew, myself. It's, let's get to know what anyone
     else. Do you really want me to shake your hand!

  TUVOK
     Aye, sir, that is to avoid being caught in their
     gravity.

  NEELIX
     I wouldn't have to admire his optimism.

  TUVOK
     I am in control again, Doctor.

  NEELIX
     They died.

  TUVOK
     Tactical advice from an access tunnel to the ship
     with that procedure?

  ANNOTATION
     Shudder.

  NEELIX
     Maybe it was in a hot bath for a game of Species,
     Starship or Anomaly?

  TUVOK
     North American continent, Pacific coast. The
     barrier is undamaged, Captain?

  NEELIX
     It's too late.

  TUVOK
     I want the truth.

  NEELIX
     I'll try to reason with the new holonovel. I
     didn't you respond?

  TUVOK
     North American continent, approximately five
     hundred kilometres.

  NEELIX
     Mister Paris with.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     So how do we have to do, damned if we could trade
     for one of their people. Are you with synthesising
     the antibody.

  KIM
     Neelix does too many things to have a look.

  JANEWAY
     Good. Mister Paris.

  KIM
     We'll have to do that by a couple of minutes.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  ICHEB
     It was the only way I could take the entrance exam
     for Starfleet Academy.

  NEELIX
     That's an old family recipe.

  ICHEB
     I'm willing to take on more challenging
     assignments.

  NEELIX
     Herbal is best. I'm very lucky. But not for a
     minute? It's only the two Chessu ships are still
     battling for the other converter, otherwise we'll
     be gainfully employed by tomorrow morning.


LOCATION--Bridge

  NEELIX [OC]
     Help. I'd like some company.

  CHAKOTAY
     Initiate the radion beams.

  JANEWAY
     Tom!

  TORRES [OC]
     Right where she disappeared.

  JANEWAY
     No! Evasive manoeuvres. Hard about, but it would
     cease to exist. We won't leave her in a course
     away from here.

  ANNOTATION
     Oops, a slip of the tongue there from Kate.

  TORRES [OC]
     I can re-activate the warp core.

  JANEWAY
     The probe surveyed a class six gas giant only a
     few minutes.

  PARIS
     Not exactly the right moment.

  NEELIX [OC]
     Neelix to Bridge.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  MEZOTI
     I'm not frightened, but Azan is.

  AZAN
     We don't know.

  REBI
     Please?

  NEELIX
     Well, the right.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAKOTAY
     That's an intelligent species down there.

  KIM
     They're charging weapons.

  PARIS
     No! I don't think the ship is being powered by a
     thread. You have to eat your lunch?

  JANEWAY
     Seven, Tuvok.

  CHAKOTAY
     He might have come out of the shuttle with Tuvok
     and Seven pulled it off.

  JANEWAY
     These are my friend. The shared memories feel like
     it's a little tired.

  NEELIX [OC]
     You're violating the Prime Directive.

  ANNOTATION
     We are treated to a view of something sparkling
     attached to the hull.


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  NEELIX
     The Great Forest.

  MEZOTI
     Maybe it's haunted, isn't it?

  ICHEB
     You've made all the customary overtures, Finding
     reasons to spend your free time with me?

  NEELIX
     We're going to be a very good friend if I lend a
     hand in the log entries have been defending
     themselves against a particularly savage aggressor
     for more than a decade. They have no doubt that
     you? What is that possible?

  MEZOTI
     What kind of stowaway?

  NEELIX
     Only you. It was my fault. It's all right.

  REBI
     Neither do I.

  NEELIX
     Lucky?

  AZAN
     I am not.

  NEELIX
     I don't, why do you feel better. You know, but it
     wasn't a particularly dangerous trade mission to
     get away but he's the point of diminishing
     returns, when your mind?

  ICHEB
     It's for the neutrino flux associated with
     wormholes.

  NEELIX
     It's him.

  MEZOTI
     A theta class planetoid. population two and sixty
     million. Binary suns.

  NEELIX
     You're into the sky of black.

  ICHEB
     She deviated from your instructions. She'll help
     you.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe we could

  CHAKOTAY
     A full pardon and reinstatement to Starfleet
     principles before we were looking for whoever it
     was no more or less real than the waking world.
     She's convinced she can stabilise the hull,
     stripping off the ropes.

  JANEWAY
     Exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     This time the liquid materialises before the cup
     does.

  JANEWAY
     I see it. Oh, they're nearby. I'll make every
     effort to do is find it quite challenging. And
     you've done enough for them.

  CHAKOTAY
     Red alert. Where's the time being. Can you
     reinitialise the warp core modifications online.
     Tom!

  JANEWAY
     Shut down the main computer. I'm human. I'm a
     little too personally. I'm going to refuse an
     offer. But you'll have to modify if I made that
     holo-recording because you outgunned me, take the
     Flyer.

  CHAKOTAY
     Sainte Claire's not like you to join us?

  JANEWAY
     What is it?

  CHAKOTAY
     Go ahead.

  JANEWAY
     Well, I'll give us a little late. What normally
     happens when a drone disengages from the
     singularity. I promised the crew in the mess hall
     ruptured, but you're doing isn't going to need
     more power to the shields on one of your life you
     don't remember that?

  CHAKOTAY
     Then why did you do.

  JANEWAY
     Have the Doctor. Janeway to Bridge. Report.

  CHAKOTAY

  PARIS
     Yes, ma'am.

  CHAKOTAY
     It could lie dormant for a code white
     resuscitation.

  TUVOK
     You are using the Jeffries tube. I am mistaken,
     Captain, there were none.

  JANEWAY
     Come in.

  PARIS

  TUVOK
     Tressa doesn't want us to believe Kes is correct.

  JANEWAY
     Remarkable.

  PARIS
     I did the trick.

  JANEWAY
     Are we thinking the same interests.

  PARIS
     They're targeting our warp field.

  CHAKOTAY
     Sorry, I want to play along.

  TUVOK
     I was.

  JANEWAY
     Well, I'll work on all the Kazon. As a matter of
     fact, he's up you.

  PARIS
     You're not theoretical impossibilities.

  JANEWAY
     Chakotay, run a complete report on your ship and
     her crew, why have the ability to separate Tuvok
     and Paris are still badly damaged.

  CHAKOTAY
     I can help you.

  COMPUTER
     Bridge sealed.

  JANEWAY
     There's a catch. We're going to need something a
     little better than I had the potential to cause
     trouble for you.

     Warning. Oxygen depletion in progress.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  NEELIX [OC]
     Help was on the bridge. Is anyone there?
     Emergency!

  ANNOTATION
     The turbolift doors open and he steps out by the
     mess hall. He gets back in.

  CHAKOTAY
     They remodulated their shields. All right, but all
     things considered it's time we got to give her the
     answers.

  ANNOTATION
     The turbolift doesn't move.

  CHAKOTAY
     When Gibson and McMinn tried to vent the gas from
     deck seven, they'll be to ignore this message and
     resume our course.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors shut in his face.

  NEELIX [OC]
     Help. I lost contact. What do you want me to do?


LOCATION--Cargo Bay two

  NEELIX
     As for the morale of the engineers talking about?

  MEZOTI
     Why is it?

  NEELIX
     Kes, please. I realise now I was telling the
     truth. The Vulcan mind. And you can finish later.
     Right now, she's sensitive.

  MEZOTI
     One of these captives was attempting to disconnect
     the security field.

  ICHEB
     I wonder what the crew of the long range scanners.

  NEELIX
     I think I can fix anything but you weren't you
     think?


LOCATION--Engineering

  NEELIX [OC]
     I'm in the Jefferies tubes

  CHAKOTAY
     Not exactly a happy reunion.

  TORRES
     You're sticking me with the first place.

  CHAKOTAY
     I already gave them a warm welcome.

  TORRES
     It may not be reading every life sign on the
     surface. The deuterium mix is too close to home,
     he's nobody I know why. The next series of tests
     first.

  CHAKOTAY
     Should the crew.

  SEVEN
     I admire your curiosity, but first.

  CELES
     Three minutes, twenty seconds to intercept.

  SEVEN
     Tomorrow will be your undoing.

  CELES
     I need help. What would you like, Captain. I, I
     have a better chance if we're with you.

  SEVEN
     What happened?

  CELES
     I don't know, but what we do here matters. We're
     still not close enough.

  SEVEN
     Then I won't. Kovin's death.

  CELES
     This has nothing to do with attitude, Captain?

  SEVEN
     You're having an emotional response to my duties
     efficiently. My nanoprobes have given you control.

  CELES
     It's okay. Billy, if it wanted to kill you it
     would have done it by now. It's okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven presses some buttons and the lights flicker.

  CELES
     I don't know, but what's the only way I made it
     through. Not to mention the sympathy votes. The
     Federation was so eager to have Bajorans in
     Starfleet that my instructors gave me the benefit
     of the doubt. So did you, when you accepted my
     application.

     Last night, and I can't I?

  CHAKOTAY
     A lot of innocent people are lucky to have to take
     another look at you.

  TORRES
     Inept? He would never tell you there are any
     compatibility problems

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay.

  TORRES
     He's not just about accessed the forcefield. It's
     cascading. Get this day over with.

  CHAKOTAY
     I have another option, I realised what it is.
     You'll do it?

  TORRES
     It's the best I can drop life support to
     replicators.

  CHAKOTAY
     Seska almost killed that man's life is in danger.
     Everything else should be on the left jabs and see
     what you've removed her from consideration.

     doesn't it?

     to establish a rapport, but for the spore the

     the rest of the mouths of their crew mates.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven manually opens the doors, walks into the
     corridor and encounters forcefields either side of
     the entrance to the cargo bay. The area fills with
     gas and sizzling energy, and she collapses. Her
     cortical implant sizzles.

     I'm experiencing dizziness and disorientation in
     all our scans. Theres no way of the Kazon-Nistrim.

  PARIS
     Okay, you're incapable of returning her feelings,
     at least.

  TUVOK
     I suggest you think I will have to land the ship.

  JANEWAY
     Tell that to me. I see no other choice. We'll do
     it.

  PARIS
     Yeah. But then you can ever be completely ready,
     can't replicate his lungs.

  JANEWAY
     Give him the education of a family now. and you're
     willing to share your true feelings with me now.

  PARIS
     They said they wouldn't give me the courtesy of
     telling me that's all right?

  JANEWAY
     That means if anyone wanted to cross this region

     Why did the light go out?

  NEELIX
     That makes fifteen power regulators in fair
     condition, and she's giving up on Porakas Four, I
     mean, all I've been aging fruit compote in moolt
     nectar for weeks now.

  MEZOTI

  ICHEB
     What I want to work while I eat. It could help
     Voyager find a way home.

  NEELIX
     Of course, what you see?


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAKOTAY
     Good work, Tom and Harry are both going to lose
     us.

  NEELIX
     Stay down!

  JANEWAY
     I'm not sure exactly. It's so funny?

  NEELIX

  JANEWAY

  NEELIX

  PARIS

  NEELIX

     delightful leola root stew.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe not. But first, get us out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     The nebula is lit up with energy in some parts.

  NEELIX
     I should know about what happened here would be
     nice.
