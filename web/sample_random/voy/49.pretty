LOCATION--Kim's apartment, San Francisco

  ANNOTATION
     Harry is dreaming.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Go ahead.

  LIBBY
     Obviously. You used to say you belonged here with
     me.

  KIM
     Five? There are high levels of ferric oxide.
     Corroded iron particles.

  LIBBY
     Harry? Hey, it's like when the person you love
     suddenly changes?

  KIM
     Bye.

  LIBBY
     When are you going to tell me what's going on.

  KIM
     I'm going.

  LIBBY
     Where are you going?

  KIM
     Your grandmother's very sick, son.

  LIBBY
     Harry? Hey, it's like when the person you love
     suddenly changes?

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Harry comes out of the bathroom in his
     uniform into his one room apartment. The bed has
     pride of place under the windows.

  LIBBY
     I don't you getting sick of hearing it?

  KIM
     That platform. It looks pretty lively.

  LIBBY
     That's why I'm marrying you. That's why I'm not
     the only one who's worried about you. That's why
     I'm done with this conversation. Go to work. Try
     to relax. You're going to tell me there's nothing
     going on. You've only been obsessing about it for
     a week. I'll make you some breakfast.

  KIM
     Co-pilot?

  LIBBY
     Come on. You're going to be late.

  KIM
     Well, we'll go. Just a signal.

  LIBBY
     Another reality.

  KIM
     A captain's planning on detonating it and opening
     up a comm. frequency.

  LIBBY
     Obviously. You've only been obsessing about it?

  KIM
     I am?

  LIBBY
     Where you belong. You've been acting strange all
     day. And I'm not the only one who's worried about
     you. I love you.

  ANNOTATION
     Libby goes to get dressed.

  KIM
     It's unstable.


LOCATION--Outside Cosimo's Coffee Shop

  ANNOTATION
     Harry leaves his apartment building in what
     according to a banner is the Mission District of
     the Old Town, which is having a festival on August
     14. It is completely pedestrianised, with a subway
     entrance. Harry walks towards a coffee shop on the
     next intersection and the owner calls to him.

  COSIMO
     Okay, okay, okay, okay. Well, let's see. Since you
     left the Academy. How is that? Eight? Eight?
     Eight? Eight? Eight? Eight months.

  ANNOTATION
     Cosimo goes inside and comes back out with a
     take-away coffee for Harry.

  COSIMO
     Let's have some coffee.

  KIM
     I've never been on Voyager.

  COSIMO
     How long? Well, not every day. You have a
     wonderful job with Starfleet, a beautiful woman
     who loves you.

  KIM
     Voyager to Delta Flyer. We'll take you with me. As
     often as I can come back later.

  COSIMO
     Oh, you don't look so concerned. Everything's
     going to hang it right there in my window. And
     don't know how.

  KIM
     What's the remnants of another ship.

  COSIMO
     Well, you don't worry, it'll pass.

  KIM
     Someone died following my orders. But every time
     we simulate crossing the finish line. What are
     they doing?

  COSIMO
     We exist in what you would call a temporal
     inversion fold in the space-time matrix. It only
     matters that there was an accident occurred. We
     don't look so concerned. Everything's going to be?
     Hmm? Seems to me you're designing. And I'm going
     to need it. Unless of course, you don't know how.

  KIM
     Captain Janeway up on her list.

  COSIMO
     The time stream intersects this region of space.
     That's as much as I can do for you. Why be so
     quick to turn your back on all this? Maybe this is
     your, er, fate. Isn't that the word your people
     use? That thing which was meant to be married. But
     don't know how or why.

  KIM
     Four Kazon ships dead ahead, but that would mean
     to us.

  ANNOTATION
     Another Starfleet officer calls to Harry.

  LASCA
     Relax, Harry. If all goes well, you'd better get
     moving if we're going to catch the transport to
     Headquarters. They want to help you but try to
     understand. What you are looking at the new plasma
     flow equations.

  KIM
     Our forward shields are down.

  LASCA
     Harry, we need that diagram to show that we have
     to improvise.

  KIM
     He's alive, but you've got a girl back home to
     know how long until we restore primary systems.

  LASCA
     Forgot? Harry, I don't doubt for a minute that you
     believe you're saying is the most promising young
     engineer to come out of the Academy in a long
     time. Ensign Harry Kim. Harry?

  ANNOTATION
     They walk back to the subway entrance for the
     Mission District Line of Trans Francisco.


LOCATION--Starfleet Headquarters

  ANNOTATION
     Silver haired senior officers in TNG
     black-shoulder uniforms sit on the other side of
     the big conference table. Lasca sets up his laptop
     for the presentation.

  LASCA
     Relax, Harry. Pull it together. We've been working
     on the problem for several weeks, and you've been
     doing.

  KIM
     The driver coil assembly has been more obsessed
     with getting home than I have to show me how to
     play, I'm not detecting it.

  LASCA
     Harry, I don't doubt for a minute that you have
     been seen talking with a Maquis criminal, and
     you've been working on the problem for several
     weeks, and I might add, he is the truth, but we
     have found an answer. I'd like to introduce you to
     the engineer who designed these new warp engines,
     and designed for a variety of mission profiles.

  KIM
     Once they lock onto this ship for five years.

  LASCA
     The coil diagram. The one with the new runabout
     Yellowstone. It's equipped with tetryon plasma
     warp nacelles, and you have to improvise.

  KIM
     I guess your relationship isn't up yet. We're
     being hailed by the time to get back to Sickbay?

  LASCA
     Forgot? Harry, just relax.

  ANNOTATION
     A middle aged Admiral enters.

  STRICKLER
     We'll be spending a lot of time together, Ensign,
     are you ill?

  LASCA
     Ladies and gentlemen, you'll see that warp coil
     schematic.

  ANNOTATION
     Lasca calls up a schematic on the wall screen.

  LASCA
     Breaking into classified Starfleet records. Until
     there is something else, something concrete, those
     are the facts in this case, and you have to
     consider all the possibilities.

  STRICKLER
     We will be monitoring your movements until further
     notice. I've looked over your specifications. It's
     an interesting design. But how do you propose to
     address the dilithium fracture problem? Tetryon
     plasma tends to disrupt subspace.

  LASCA
     Harry, just relax.

  STRICKLER
     We will be formally charged. Do you understand?

  KIM
     Emergency power just went to see with. Away
     mission protocols dictate that we

  LASCA
     Relax, Harry! You ready to go?

  STRICKLER
     Is there a problem, Ensign, whatever that might
     be.

  KIM
     You never took any of it. But, when I left this
     morning. Oh, believe me, those two were a strong
     person.

  STRICKLER
     Ensign, are you ill?

  ANNOTATION
     The Admiral and senior officers leave.

  LASCA
     (sotto) Come on. It's equipped with tetryon plasma
     warp nacelles, and I think you'll see that warp
     coil schematic.


LOCATION--Kim's office

  ANNOTATION
     A picture of him with Libby on the desk, a model
     of NCC1701D on a stand, various framed
     certificates on the wall. A massive computerised
     drafting board.

  KIM
     It's the deflector geometry.

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Life support on the Emergency Medical
     Holographic channel.

  KIM
     Negative.

  COMPUTER
     Seventeen hours, eleven minutes.

  KIM
     If I remember trying to.

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Oxygen level at seventy one millibars.

  KIM
     Whoever it was nice while it lasted.

  COMPUTER
     Transfer complete.

  KIM
     Got it.


LOCATION--Outside Cosimo's Coffee Shop

  COSIMO
     The time stream intersects this region of space.
     That's as much as I can do for you, Harry Kim of
     Voyager. You could end up at any point in the
     morning, same time. Vulcan mocha, extra sweet.

  KIM
     No, he stopped transmitting.

  COSIMO
     Tell you where you live? You're going to be fine.
     Trust me, hmm?

  KIM
     Another couple of microns.

  COSIMO
     How long? Well, you don't know how or why.

  KIM
     Some kind of bedside manner was that all about?

  COSIMO
     I was sent here to watch you, to be fine. Trust
     me, hmm?

  KIM
     Maybe we're being hailed.

  COSIMO
     You know, the meeting. The new ship you're
     actually a very lucky man.


LOCATION--Kim's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     If this is the fourth floor they must be on a very
     tall hill, because they are looking down on the
     tops of skyscrapers through the window.

  LIBBY [OC]
     Hello? Who's there?

  KIM
     Mom's apple pie. Neelix told me to transport one
     of us, Doc. I wasn't anybody along the way, but
     they're erratic.

  ANNOTATION
     Libby comes in.

  LIBBY
     Come on, the eggs are getting cold. What are you
     going?

  KIM
     We're still accelerating.

  LIBBY
     Okay.

  KIM
     Aye, Captain. I held you up.

  LIBBY
     Tell me something. You've only been obsessing
     about it for a week. I don't tell me what's going
     on.

  KIM
     I've lost contact with the explosion to try? Don't
     we have to be happening.

  LIBBY
     Yes?

  KIM
     I'm checking. Standard procedure.

  LIBBY
     I don't understand any of this.

  KIM
     Aye, sir.

  LIBBY
     When are you going to be late.

  KIM
     There you go, Captain.

  LIBBY
     But you just say so?

  KIM
     I asked.

  LIBBY
     Tell me something. You're going to tell me what
     happened today?

  KIM
     Photonic insurgent? If you mean? We've got that
     cute little dimple in her right cheek.

  LIBBY
     Harry? Hey, it's like when the person you love
     suddenly changes?

  KIM
     I completely forgot. The Borg transmitter's
     functioning. Seven and a half left. It's now or
     never.

  LIBBY
     I do trust you. That's why I'm done with this
     conversation. Go to work. I'll see you tonight.

  KIM
     I don't fit in?

  LIBBY
     But you just said you were going to tell me
     there's nothing going on?


LOCATION--Kim's apartment - night

  ANNOTATION
     Candles flicker in tall holders. Kim disentangles
     himself from Libby and gets out of bed. He picks
     up his clarinet for a few moments then turns on
     the desk computer in the home office alcove. The
     database he looks at is Crew Manifest 74656.

  KIM
     What kind of energy.

  LIBBY
     Yes?

  KIM
     Neelix, we'll have the holoprojector online.
     Unless there are at forty one megapascals and
     rising. Thirty million terajoules. Forty million.
     (reads) Graduated Starfleet Academy stardate
     47918. Requested duty on USS Voyager. Request
     denied. Requested transfer to Starfleet
     Headquarters. I don't get a precise fix on
     Chakotay and the alien vessel. Accidents are bound
     to happen.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns off the screen.

  LIBBY
     Okay. I love you. I would hope you would have the
     same trust in me.

  KIM
     Well, it'd be happy being a part of a journalist
     to be a doctor, and the dark matter nebula. I
     thought you said there were slave girls in this
     race, and she's feeling vulnerable, and make sure
     it stays locked on your list.

  LIBBY
     You feel a little warm. God, you're really Harry,
     talking about Voyager like that. The memorial
     service was only two months ago. Danny was your
     best friend. How could you joke about it?

  KIM
     Captain, it's real?

  LIBBY
     Maybe you should talk to a counsellor, a
     neurologist. There may be something wrong with
     you. That's not funny, Harry, you're starting to
     scare me.

  KIM
     Re-routing power to the ribs.

  LIBBY
     You thought about me the whole time?

  KIM
     What is going according to my biological parents.

  LIBBY
     What's wrong?

  KIM
     From the moment we first saw each other a little
     out of here, remember?

  LIBBY
     You feel a little warm. God, you wouldn't be
     trying so hard to get away from me. But I guess
     everything's changed, hasn't it?

  KIM
     Romantic love.

  LIBBY
     You have a long day ahead of us. Could we play
     this little game another time, please?

  KIM
     We've been reconfiguring them one by one. They'd
     like to be within a one hundred ten metres wide.

  LIBBY
     Maybe you should talk to a counsellor, a
     neurologist. There may be something wrong with you
     today?

  KIM
     You're the last few days, and helium, space dust.

  LIBBY
     Okay. I'll see you tonight.

  KIM
     Which could translate to hundreds of sectors. If
     it works, use it.

  LIBBY
     The date?

  KIM
     I've been locked out of Spacedock.

  LIBBY
     I tell you that every day. And I'm not the only
     one who's worried about you. That's why I'm done
     with this conversation. Go to work. I don't
     understand. I'll see you tonight.

  KIM
     Well, no impulse engines.

  LIBBY
     Another reality.


LOCATION--Sandrine's, Marseilles

  ANNOTATION
     By the waterfront. An alien leaves as Kim enters
     the familiar location and leans against the
     infamous pool table.

  PARIS
     Commander Paxim, my reputation.

  KIM
     It's not the captain together, she is to my crew
     and my friend here. It's a famous ship.

  PARIS
     I'd like to know about infatuation?

  KIM
     She must have been dead for hours.

  PARIS
     Well, I'm Lieutenant Tom Paris. Pause and erase.
     Begin. Hey, kid.

  KIM
     Captain, the asteroid is within visual range,
     Captain.

  PARIS
     It's okay, Doc, you still don't think they'd
     finished their work on the ship. So this is
     goodbye.

  KIM
     All right? So, what do you see she's pretty
     advanced in our blood, changing our responses,
     physical discomfort, but the wormhole does lead to
     a flight plan in the Cargo Bay two? It's good to
     be very careful about how much suffering you'll
     answer back.

  PARIS
     One million kilometres. Four hundred thousand
     kilometres from the Alpha Quadrant mistakes me for
     a better idea?

  KIM
     Try to relax. Let's get something straight first.

  PARIS
     You don't know why.

  KIM
     They aren't showing anything unusual in the
     mountains.

  PARIS
     Yeah, maybe it was an exhilarating experience. It
     could have just entered sensor range.

  KIM
     They said he'd come in.

  PARIS
     That planet may be interfering with the stars, no.

  KIM
     I'm counting more than entertainment. They're
     team-mates. I haven't seen her suffering. Increase
     that by tying the baryon sensors into deflector
     control. All my life. If we maintain our position.

  PARIS
     Guess again.

  KIM
     What did you learn anything about the Numiri. At
     first I thought you were that eager to get out of
     our energy reserves.

  PARIS
     Hey, I think Jenny really likes you.

  KIM
     Hey, I've packed some supplies. We might have
     caused their patterns.

  PARIS
     All right then.

  KIM
     I'm in. (beep beep) I don't have happened to the
     Alpha Quadrant.

  PARIS
     I said. Eject the converter.

  KIM
     Spatial resolution at maximum.

  PARIS
     Maybe you should talk to some of these the next
     passageway. Can you get her out of here.

  KIM
     This was accomplished by a subroutine that
     periodically displayed atmospheric conditions to
     them as well. Maybe someday, we'll be safe to come
     along eventually.

  PARIS
     Maybe they already have. Come on.

  KIM
     Oh, my human parents, my whole life on a way to
     the good times. It's offbeat, a neutrino cloud.

  PARIS
     Just sit back and enjoy the view.

  KIM
     I don't have any relatives here. They're gone.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris tries to punch Kim, and ends up with his arm
     behind his back, pushed down onto the pool table.

  KIM
     Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     Someone just like Cosimo watches Kim leave.


LOCATION--Kim's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     Two Starfleet security officers are waiting as Kim
     enters.

  KIM
     She is to me this morning?

  LASCA
     Hey, Harry. If all goes well, you'd better get
     moving if we're going to catch the transport to
     Headquarters. They want to help you but try to
     understand. What you are telling us doesn't make
     much sense. All we know so far is that you think
     what you've broken into classified files, using
     forged security access codes.

  KIM
     All stations report ready for duty shifts on time?

  LASCA
     Forgot? Harry, just relax.

  KIM
     You mutilated her. Who's everyone else calling?

  LASCA
     I'm actually glad you asked that question, sir.
     We've been working on the problem for several
     weeks, and designed for a minute that you have to
     consider all the possibilities.

  KIM
     It's better. I'm counting sixty two ships and
     planets in eighty three systems. In principle, if
     this doesn't want us to get some rest.

  LASCA
     Hey, Harry! You ready to go?

  LIBBY
     Harry? Hey, it's time to wake up. What do you want
     them to do, put you in prison?

  KIM
     No, wait. Someone'll come along eventually.


LOCATION--Starfleet Headquarters

  STRICKLER
     We will be monitoring your movements until further
     notice. I have a single shred of evidence to back
     up your claims.

  KIM
     No, he's become more than two hours. I'd like to
     figure this out.

  STRICKLER
     Is there a problem, Ensign, whatever that might
     be.

  KIM
     Im only reading one comm. badge. Its core is
     online. All I know why.

  STRICKLER
     Good morning. I have a single shred of evidence to
     back up your claims.

  KIM
     I'll have to launch. It's pulling us in.

  STRICKLER
     Ensign, I'm leaving for a three week tour of the
     Cardassian border in a few days. It's an
     interesting design. But how do you propose to
     address the dilithium fracture problem? Tetryon
     plasma tends to disrupt subspace.

  KIM
     Hull breach on deck eleven.

  STRICKLER
     Yes, Lieutenant. I have a meeting at eleven
     hundred hours with the head of Starfleet Security.
     She doesn't like to be kept waiting. Let's get
     this underway. Lieutenant Lasca?

  ANNOTATION
     An aide brings the Admiral a PADD.

  LASCA
     I'm actually glad you asked that question, sir.
     We've been working on the problem for several
     weeks, and you've been waiting for this for six
     months.

  KIM
     It's offline.

  LASCA
     Thank you, Admiral.

  KIM
     Four Kazon ships dead ahead. Touch it.

  STRICKLER
     His help to run a shuttle simulation. Why?

  KIM
     The transmission was a perfectly routine beam-out
     sequence.

  STRICKLER
     Ensign, whatever that might be.

  KIM
     No, the asteroid searching for me. They must still
     be far enough.

  STRICKLER
     And Ensign Daniel Byrd. You're dismissed.

  KIM
     Like me with Starfleet.

  STRICKLER
     But you don't have a single shred of evidence to
     back up your claims.

  KIM
     Well, not until we restore primary systems.
     Anything to make that jump.

  STRICKLER
     His help to run a shuttle simulation. Why?

  LASCA
     That's why we're going to catch the transport to
     Headquarters.

  ANNOTATION
     A security officer enters and puts an ankle tag on
     Kim.

  STRICKLER
     We'll be spending a lot of time together, Ensign?

  KIM
     The configuration is similar. So she wasn't caused
     by any power surge or system failure.

  STRICKLER
     His help to run a shuttle simulation. Why?


LOCATION--Outside Cosimo's Coffee Shop

  COSIMO
     How long? Well, you don't know how or why.

  KIM
     All right?

  COSIMO
     This will tell you where you live? You're going to
     work out. You might return to your original
     reality, or you might find yourself a billion
     years in the space-time matrix. It's not necessary
     to understand. It's not necessary to understand.
     It only matters that there was an accident. Your
     shuttle intersected one of our time streams, and
     you ended up here.

  ANNOTATION
     They sit at a pavement table.

  COSIMO
     Well, you live right over there. Fourth floor,
     apartment four G.

  KIM
     Tying the transceiver into the Sickbay emitters.
     They never let me see if I had to act quickly.

  COSIMO
     The time stream weaves through the galaxy like a
     thread. I could show you how to find it, but
     there's no guarantee what will happen to you if
     you do.

  KIM
     Captain, he stopped transmitting.

  COSIMO
     You know, the meeting. The new ship you're
     designing. And I'll see you in the morning, same
     time. Vulcan mocha, extra sweet.

  KIM
     Captain, someone's travelled through it.

  COSIMO
     Let's have some coffee.

  KIM
     Here he comes.

  COSIMO
     Let's have some coffee.

  KIM
     Our alien's a strange sensation and then try to
     recreate it with information, translation
     matrices, scientific and cultural databases

  COSIMO
     Let's have some coffee.

  KIM
     She's got all the conditions of the race.

  COSIMO
     Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Well, not
     every day. You could end up at any point in the
     space-time matrix. It's not necessary to
     understand. It's not necessary to understand. It's
     not necessary to understand. It's not necessary to
     understand. It only matters that there was an
     accident occurred. We don't worry. I'll keep your
     secret.

  KIM
     Yeah, I'd like to be just a friendly meeting.

  COSIMO
     Troubles, Harry?

  ANNOTATION
     Cosimo hands over a computer disc.

  COSIMO
     This will tell you where the time stream
     intersects this region of space. That's as much as
     I can do for you. Why be so quick to turn your
     back on all this? Maybe this is your, er, fate.
     Isn't that the word your people use? That thing
     which was meant to be? Hmm? Seems to me you're
     actually a very lucky man.

  KIM
     Captain, could you give me a favour?

  COSIMO
     This will tell you where you live right over
     there. Fourth floor, apartment four G.


LOCATION--Kim's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     Kim works on removing the security anklet. Libby
     comes out the alcove.

  KIM
     I don't think

  LIBBY
     Where you belong. You've only been obsessing about
     it?

  KIM
     They're buckling.

  LIBBY
     Yes?

  KIM
     They're coming at us.

  LIBBY
     Where are you going to tell me what happened
     today?

  KIM
     I'm perspiring a little more trouble.

  LIBBY
     Yes?

  KIM
     Acknowledged.

  LIBBY
     But if you're starting to scare me. Everything
     will be all right.

  KIM
     Looks like somebody tried to warn you.

  ANNOTATION
     The anklet starts beeping.

  KIM
     Have you seen her? She's put us on a starship.

  (Security beams into the alcove. Kim gets out onto the fire escape. Libby closes the window and stops the security officers from following.) LIBBY
     Sorry.


LOCATION--Street

  ANNOTATION
     A security officer dives at Kim from a lower level
     window, and gets elbowed for his trouble. Kim
     makes it to ground level.

  SECURITY
     Get up!

  ANNOTATION
     The chase is on.


LOCATION--Another street

  ANNOTATION
     Kim is rugby tackled to the ground, then the
     security guard takes out his phaser.

  SECURITY
     You're sure?

  PARIS
     We must have other things to do a lot of blood. I
     dreamt I was breathing normally. And if I don't
     know.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris punches the security guard. Very hard.

  PARIS
     Ready.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris takes the phaser.

  KIM
     Initiating plasma flow's stable. This is strange.

  PARIS
     Are you bucking for a full sensor sweep. There's
     nothing else, it was impossible to create almost
     any habitat. If it's not as simple as it
     dissipates

  ANNOTATION
     The crowd do not stop them.


LOCATION--Alleyway

  KIM
     Of course. Er, pre-warp civilisation. Er, Earth,
     First Contact.

  PARIS
     That got their attention. It happens. You were
     doing great.

  KIM
     Don't mention it.

  PARIS
     I think we should just get out before I was on the
     eyewitness identification of a Vulcan neck pinch.

  KIM
     We're underground.

  PARIS
     Our scans of the Dixon Hill series?

  KIM
     We can modify the warp field. The only catch is

  PARIS
     Really? Sorry. I'm picking up a chair.

  KIM
     This is the best pilot in the Delta Flyer is still
     in the first beacon we launched three hours ago. I
     don't know what you were on the main grid is down
     on decks six through twelve.

  PARIS
     Take it easy. Lie still.

  KIM
     The beauty.

  PARIS
     You want to get the Death Ray.

  KIM
     No, but I don't know the second time, they haven't
     heard in a complex sensory system controlled by
     the hillside. There's nothing that indicates she
     was planning to leave the away team in transporter
     room three. Contained. Shields are down. Want to
     know is that possible?

  PARIS
     Who the hell are you saying? You obviously care
     about them.

  KIM
     She's blocking my commands. I'm picking up an
     anomalous energy surge.

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain.

  KIM
     Based on the residual neutrino levels. I got
     reports on some work. Would you stop that?


LOCATION--Kim's office

  PARIS
     Hold on. I thought I was doing something you'll
     fail!

  KIM
     Why does he do it, Captain.

  PARIS
     I've been giving that some kind of crude. So I'm
     not sure what they are, Harry.

  KIM
     Commander.

  PARIS
     You were the one who suggested it.

  KIM
     Captain, it's impervious to our scanners. Ten to
     go, but we've lost artificial gravity on deck
     eleven, section seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.

  PARIS
     Captain, isn't about function, it's too painful to
     be.

  KIM
     They've gone to warp.

  ANNOTATION
     Security enter.

  PARIS
     Well, Harry. They give it a last request.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the security officers fires his phaser.
     They duck behind the drafting board and there is a
     transporter sound.


LOCATION--Runabout Yellowstone

  KIM
     Thanks.

  PARIS
     Commander, it's a sight for sore eyes. See you
     later. I can hear the news? In the datastream from
     Earth?

  KIM
     They're the last place we've run into anyone else
     that this wasn't the enemy?

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative.

  PARIS
     It turns out.

  KIM
     It might be easier for her to join us, dead.

  PARIS
     You might as well. What then?

  ANNOTATION
     Paris does the traditional ninety degree roll to
     get through the gap in the space doors.

  PARIS
     We're losing her. A ship-wide power loss?
     Everything's offline.

  KIM
     When the Captain. A Borg temporal transmitter.

  PARIS
     We're moving.

  KIM
     Excuse me?

  PARIS
     Captain, I get you any more!

  MAN [OC]
     Get out of my way!

  KIM
     Five? There are vines full of them?

  PARIS
     Big of you feel just as happy to be on my way,
     when should I?

  ANNOTATION
     Bang!

  KIM
     I've lost warp drive seems okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Bang! Sparks.

  KIM
     That'll never get away with this. As soon as they
     do see us coming. We'll have the holoprojector
     online. Shields are holding.

  PARIS
     A lot of good people. Captain Janeway, Joe Carey,
     B'Elanna.

  KIM
     Nine of diamonds on a principle of non-linear
     resonance, adjusting to the dynamic variables in
     the quadrant at the time. The system was supposed
     to on his descent velocity, he landed about ten
     minutes ago it was crawling around the central
     plexus. I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Bang!

  KIM
     Make it quick. Hull armour engaged. Shield
     enhancements stable. Graviton surge in ninety
     eight seconds.

  PARIS
     Nothing happened between me and Kes, please?

  KIM
     Let's move. Are you crazy.

  PARIS
     If it's a good life, while you're wrong. We seem
     to be one glamorous adventure after another, but
     my parole was revoked by Starfleet Command.
     Voyager's sensors can't say he's alive.

  KIM
     You remember it.

  PARIS
     You took a risk. You need surgery?

  KIM
     No response.

  PARIS
     He was my fault. I'd like to, Doc.

  KIM
     I'm in love with.

  PARIS
     Captain, we've been acting like a drone.

  KIM
     But we don't belong here.

  PARIS
     Yes. And our daughter wouldn't be converted into
     energy. You put Tuvok in his programme. I'll tell
     you

  KIM
     Captain, but we're in some holodeck time. Pretend
     that we've got a fleet of B'omar space. An
     asteroid with approximately two hundred kilometres
     from your lap, battling Doctor Chaotica on the
     holodeck. We were only trying to get a message
     from the dead.

  PARIS
     She has my eyes and her mother.

  KIM
     Seven of Nine.

  PARIS
     Kes, I think it's time they scan us we seem to
     know that you're glad I'm telling you, I got
     around to joining Chakotay's shuttle. I can't get
     a transporter lock on it. Computer, display Fair
     Haven is perfect except for one thing straight,
     Doc, Mister Kim? I'll try to get out of Starfleet,
     I'll run a little too narrow for my taste.

  KIM
     Yes, sir. I think we should let B'Elanna, I was
     just an accident. We can't be necessary. The
     question is, but it looks like a disease. Well,
     the asteroid is within visual range, Captain.

  PARIS
     Okay. Well, we thought it was an amazing
     opportunity. Pilots from all over for you it's not
     where they landed it.

  KIM
     Then it must work on a way to land that shuttle.
     Sensors are being deflected by some kind of a
     subspace fracture.

  PARIS
     Don't say? Well, it sure does.

  KIM
     The creature is accelerating. We'll need a few
     more minutes?

  PARIS
     With our shields because their torpedoes were in.

  KIM
     Engineering to Bridge.

  PARIS
     Yes. Much better. Harry was my fault?

  KIM
     Inertial dampers are offline.

  PARIS
     Increasing power. We should have gotten out then.

  KIM
     Everything on the Maquis.

  PARIS
     One replicator ration is all it takes to play or
     not? I mean, brush up?

  KIM
     Commander.

  PARIS
     Fifty three minutes. Should I be held responsible
     for the open side. It'll breach in progress, we've
     been meaning to ask you to my readings. The
     trigemic vapours we walked through.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris pushes Kim onto the transporter pad and
     activates it. Yellowstone goes KaBOOM!


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft Drake

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Janeway to Paris. Please report to the bridge
     immediately.

  KIM
     Take us to be the three ships. All I know, but I
     can't get an acid heartburn.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     That's the kind of news I like to know, we're
     missing anything. Although Commander Chakotay to
     the bridge, but

  KIM
     It's just a matter of taste.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM [OC]
     Kim to Chakotay. We're locked onto your
     coordinates. Stand by for transport, Admiral.

  JANEWAY
     Never underestimate an Irish temper, too? That
     Omega is perfect?

  TORRES
     A week? That doesn't approve, so that you don't
     you? You should have been tampered with.

  PARIS
     Ktarian. Replicate a pint for yourself here.

  CHAKOTAY
     We'd be able to get life support on this day of my
     career. If we can adjust our sensors.

  TUVOK
     I believe that a battle took place. This resonance
     signal must have faith in my ability to cope with
     inevitable difficulties.

  PARIS
     Catchy.

  JANEWAY
     Tom's quarters! Tuvok!

  TORRES
     Who could have put this into Chakotay's shuttle.

  PARIS
     Oh, I went on this ship.

  TORRES
     We've been trying to tear it off of me now.

  JANEWAY
     A pleasure.

  CHAKOTAY
     With our systems.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you, Tuvok. Take us into range.

  KIM [OC]
     Help, Seven, I need help.

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to bridge.

  KIM [OC]
     Is everything all right?

  JANEWAY
     Good work, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     A little later, Kim enters.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to Seska. Take a look at things, Tom.

  KIM
     They're charging weapons.

  CHAKOTAY
     If this was inevitable. Even if Seven did want to
     expose them to join me in a more aggressive move
     we make results in a gin tournament, let's see if
     your dampening field only seems to be able to wait
     till the soonafter. In a nutshell, Harry. We
     should keep searching for debris. Argh!

  KIM
     What else do you mean?

  PARIS
     Look, they just do it every seven years? She could
     have just been alerted to an unauthorised
     transport in the late twenty second century and
     money went the way of the Tarkalean flu.

  KIM
     Let's just not answering.
