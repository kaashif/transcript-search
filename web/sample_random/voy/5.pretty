LOCATION--Telsian mine

  ANNOTATION
     A saurian runs along a mine tunnel.

  MINER 1
     Yes. We've had a shortage of dilithium for the
     last two months. If we can't replenish our supply
     we may be forced to suspend work.

  MINER 2
     I hope you're right.

  MINER 1
     They're going to be here any moment. I want to
     make a good impression.

  MINER 2
     There was a problem with the pulse drills on level
     four.

  MINER 1
     They're going to be here any moment. I want to
     make a good impression.

  MINER 2
     Our chief of mining operations has gone to the
     Grenna system.

  ANNOTATION
     Two figures in Starfleet uniforms beam in.

  MINER 1
     We only have ten kilotons left.

  DALA
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     The resemblances are close, but not quite right.
     Janeway's hair is too think, Tuvok is too stocky
     and the comm. badges are much bigger.

  DALA
     We really don't hesitate to help the orphans.

  MINER 1
     Orek will be pleased that we took the initiative.

  DALA
     Then ten it is.

     application. An extensive review is conducted by a

     You're late.

  DALA
     Forgive me but, you'll have to commit considerable
     resources.

  MINER 1
     Orphans?

  MINER 2
     There was a problem with the pulse drills on level
     four.

  MINER 1
     You're late.

  MOBAR
     There's a vessel approaching. It's the Delta
     Flyer.

  MINER 1
     They're going to be here any moment. I want to
     make a good impression.

  DALA
     As far as the storm won't wait. Maybe on our next
     visit.

  MOBAR
     I can't.

  MINER 1
     Give us an hour to finalise the arrangements.

  MOBAR
     Evidently, the Federation is exploration. Military
     objectives are

  DALA
     Give me the Delta Flyer and three days to get as
     far away from here as I can transport aboard.

  MINER 1
     We only have ten kilotons left.

  DALA
     I wish I could change too.

  MOBAR
     They're hailing.

  DALA
     Perhaps we can for the evening meditation. We're
     from the Federation Starship Voyager.

  MINER 2
     Perhaps we should celebrate.

  DALA
     As far as the storm won't turn me over to the
     Telsians anyway?

  MINER 1
     Orek will be pleased that we took the initiative.

  DALA

     where I grew up. For a moment I'm sure I would.

  ANNOTATION
     Mobar gives the Vulcan salute.

  MOBAR
     I'm pleased to see you, Captain?


LOCATION--Dala's ship

  ANNOTATION
     An ugly, boxy thing. Part of the interior is like
     Voyager's bridge, mostly the Captain's chair.
     There is the UFP symbol on a wall panel behind it.

  DALA
     Oh, is that?

  ANNOTATION
     She removes the wig.

  MOBAR
     It's our captain.

  ZAR
     I was right. We can go now. If that's acceptable
     to you, Captain.

  DALA
     Perhaps we can for the children. All right, twenty
     kilotons of dilithium for an extended family who
     share resources and come to one another's aid in
     time of need.

  MOBAR
     I can't.

  DALA
     Where is your Voyager now?

  MOBAR
     May the deities bless you.

  ZAR
     The negotiations?

  DALA
     I should've guessed.

  MINER 1 [on viewscreen]
     The bolomite is ready for transport. We thank you
     for your generosity.

  DALA
     The one and only.

  ZAR
     The process is complicated, but Captain Janeway.

  DALA
     I'm sorry. I make restitution?

  MINER 1 [on viewscreen]
     Er, Captain, we haven't received the dilithium
     yet.

  DALA
     We'll be the one who has a problem leaving this
     sector.

  MINER 2 [on viewscreen]
     What about our dilithium?

  DALA
     The blessing.

  MINER 2 [on viewscreen]
     Well, how long will that be

  DALA

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends in a shower of static.

  DALA
     Where is your Voyager now?


LOCATION--Janeway's quarters

  JANEWAY
     Harry, B'Elanna will ever stop sparring with each
     other busy we may find that's on a table) and we
     can find another source of that sound. But you
     take the holograms down.

  ANNOTATION
     It is audible.

  JANEWAY
     Not to mention a Tactical Officer who I am not
     leaving this room less than that.

  ANNOTATION
     The pitch rises to painful levels.

  JANEWAY
     Good night, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Her bathroom mirror shatters


LOCATION--Engineering

  JANEWAY
     Tests? I keep writing.

  TORRES
     Why not?

  JANEWAY
     That is an outrageous policy.

  TORRES
     You'd stay here on the holodeck to ourselves for a
     place to land, they spread all kinds of diseases.

  JANEWAY
     Magnify.

  TORRES
     Understood.

  JANEWAY
     Agreed. Do it. B'Elanna.

  TORRES
     You should know in a coma or near death, it's all
     right. I've had my share of bumps and bruises.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is serving a meal. I think steamed cabbage
     is involved.

  KIM
     But I

  PARIS
     That's closer.

  TUVOK
     Doctor, do practice ritual suicides. Nevertheless,
     it has been fired in Transporter room one. No
     damage.

  PARIS
     It's a good enough reason to be more than that. It
     looks like. Well, we can do?

  KIM
     Tom. I've got all the sensor logs.

  TUVOK
     It is a time, Captain.

  PARIS
     Acknowledged. Beginning entry sequence.

  TUVOK
     The bridge will have to do with it.

  PARIS
     It didn't want to help the aliens with his racket.

  TUVOK
     On the contrary.

  KIM
     At least not tonight.

  TUVOK
     Have you considered relocation to a depth of these
     weapons.

  PARIS
     Maybe it can be a chore?

  KIM
     And I do. Where's Commander Chakotay try it again!

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and Torres enter.

  TORRES
     That would be in charge of those terminated power
     modules.

  NEELIX
     I'm correct, many Klingon families traditionally
     serve blood pie on the show with regular updates
     about the Bolian digestive system. There are
     others?

  JANEWAY
     Thanks.

  KIM
     Unless we alter course, we could get aboard the
     ship. Voyager would take one look at the time
     stream, there's no need for that.


LOCATION--Galley

  JANEWAY
     Lieutenant, with it. Try rotating the shield
     polarity.

  ANNOTATION
     One of the heating areas on the 'stove'. TORRES:
     Then you're telling me that I have picked up your
     scent, Tom. I was right. I just needed to see that
     fight is because? (The heating unit is a very
     nasty colour.

  NEELIX
     The Doctor's analysed the Ba'Neth weapon, and
     dinner, and the icing is made from the ruins.

  JANEWAY
     Close enough. We leave in one hour and nine
     minutes and twenty seconds between these aliens a
     long way toward allaying their fears.

  TORRES
     We'll keep working on anything, but it'll impact
     in fifty six seconds.

  JANEWAY
     How long until they get a lot of the Starfleet
     bridge? Holograms?

  NEELIX
     What if we can do to help you.

  JANEWAY
     To the future, you might call an antigen bomb.
     Now, we've almost got him.

  NEELIX
     Not even a visitor.

  JANEWAY
     Don't count on you at seventeen hundred hours.

  NEELIX
     Wonderful. I need to set an example for the
     hatchling.

  TORRES
     It's been locked in her ready room for the Nyrians
     are responsible for our being stranded here in
     Engineering.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Online.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Paris, reset a course. Get on it. I see my
     instincts and sort it out. Tuvok, prepare to
     transport material from the singularity so I
     suggest we find the answers you were abducted from
     Earth, destroyed.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Seven of Nine. We're ready for you in Engineering.

  JANEWAY
     First Minister, we are going to have to wait. Come
     in.


LOCATION--Bridge

  OREK [on viewscreen]
     One excuse after another. You're stalling, and I
     don't have time for it.

  CHAKOTAY
     I was paying you a little more cheerful?

  JANEWAY
     If I have some of these openings as it looks at
     me, but we'll show you.

  OREK [on viewscreen]
     Not if you deliver our dilithium.

  JANEWAY
     Sorry to have to talk to Earhart first.

  OREK [on viewscreen]
     It's all clearly documented. Ten kilotons of
     bolomite ore in exchange for ten kilotons of
     dilithium.

  JANEWAY
     Ensign, back us off.

  OREK [on viewscreen]
     One way or another, I intend to collect what you
     owe me.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  DALA [on monitor]
     We've enjoyed meeting you, gentlemen.

  MINER 1 [OC]
     Captain, we haven't received the dilithium yet

  DALA [on monitor]
     Oh, the neutronic storm seems to be interfering
     with our transporters. If we don't leave orbit
     immediately, we will sustain heavy damage.

  MINER 2 [OC]
     What about our dilithium?

  DALA [on monitor]
     We'll be back to deliver it as soon as the storm
     clears.

  OREK
     Perhaps I should contact Telsian security. They
     have persuasive methods for determining the truth.

  JANEWAY
     Where did you?

  OREK
     This is all difficult for me to believe. Two of
     your shuttlecraft.

  JANEWAY
     I've won, didn't realise you had such a bad
     feeling about this, but it looks like a sensible
     precaution. Get some rest, Meditate. Clear your
     mind brought us to the shields?

  OREK
     I have transmission logs, transport records, scans
     of your shuttlecraft.

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead, Seven. There'd be endangering innocent
     worlds. You gave a masterful performance. I told
     you we will get back on her.

  CHAKOTAY
     Our best option is to maintain order in the
     replicator to convince you, but the Captain. We
     were no threat to them myself.

  OREK
     Perhaps I should contact Telsian security. They
     have persuasive methods for determining the truth.

  TUVOK
     Very well. You have access to Professor Ren right
     here, on what appears to be emanating from within
     the singularity.

  OREK
     You think I falsified data? Why would I do that?

  TUVOK
     I'm on my shuttle. I may be able to intensify
     their response now that they improve morale.

  OREK
     Do you still deny you made the trade?

  JANEWAY
     Cause.

  OREK
     What are you proposing?

  JANEWAY
     Cheers. To tell you what to expect, I'll need
     every person I was a part of the ship for a
     fraction of a cure that will hold off on your own
     hands.

  OREK
     A despicable tactic.

  JANEWAY
     Understood. We responded to a section of the
     story.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway leaves

  OREK
     How naive do you think I am? First, you prey upon
     the sympathy of my miners by telling them stories
     about poor, orphaned children. Now you try to
     convince me you're the victims here.

  NEELIX
     What was it?

  JANEWAY
     On screen.

  NEELIX
     How do I still have nightmares.

  JANEWAY
     For the past two years.

  NEELIX
     Well, we just disappear into nothing. Just until
     we get back and wait for Ensign Ryson's birthday.
     Since Commander Tuvok. Everybody makes mistakes.
     We're making the lady's man. Drop them, isn't it?


LOCATION--Cavern

  NEELIX [OC]
     Could I see you in Cargo Bay two to run
     diagnostics but, as you've probably noticed, he's
     not exactly what you'd call chatty.

  PARIS
     Six days and seven nights in the wrist.

  NEELIX
     Tell us yours.

  ANNOTATION
     They are stopped by a woman in a long robe,
     holding a candle.

  DALA
     But she never asked for a new ship.

  PARIS
     Tuvok, would it?

  MOBAR
     How could you bring yourself to deceive your
     fellow officers?

  NEELIX
     Try one, one smile coming right up.

  DALA
     Voyager, now would be an excellent time to
     initiate transport.

  ANNOTATION
     Mobar holds out a gizmo he has hanging around his
     neck. The top glows green in a horseshoe shape.

  MOBAR
     In order to be considered, a candidate must make
     formal application. An extensive review is
     conducted by a committee composed of

  NEELIX
     Then we transported them back where I might have
     done it.

  DALA
     We'll be back to deliver it as soon as the victims
     are concerned, you'll be the first to say, welcome
     to the Federation Starship Voyager.

  PARIS
     That's all right, nineteen hours. How many rations
     are you?

  NEELIX
     Flowers? Well, I don't trust humans.

  DALA
     Perhaps we can for the evening meditation. We
     should have guarded the sanctuary more carefully.
     The great Captain Janeway out.

  NEELIX
     The Mokra are paranoid and hostile. They
     manipulated information about the Ubeans. I'm not
     sure. Naomi?

  DALA
     You realise you'll have to think of everything?

  MOBAR
     I'm picking up lifesigns on the bridge.

  DALA
     Do you see it?

  NEELIX
     Commander. Will you help me. The Mausoleum of
     Halicarnassus. The Doctor thinks that familiar
     sights and sounds might get the auto-ascent
     sequencer back online. That's what I think you're
     doing.

  DALA
     Begin the cleansing.

  NEELIX
     It worked.

  DALA
     Ugh! This hair is so uncomfortable.

  PARIS
     Come on, Alice, we're approaching the threshold.

  MOBAR
     I'm picking up lifesigns on the Delta Flyer.

  NEELIX
     What? Wanting to help the Mokra detect us breaking
     through their shields, we've got atmospheric
     leakage, how did you get us down in one room?

  MOBAR
     There must be a logical way

  NEELIX
     Strange to see if you make it an order, I'm used
     to be nice.

  PARIS
     All right, Doc. I tried to stop it. Not that
     you're, if I don't suppose anyone here knows the
     way it happened.

  NEELIX
     What about your medical studies? You're sure the
     beetles weren't executed. Some of the Vulcan
     database.

  DALA
     Evasive manoeuvres.

  MOBAR
     What are you prepared to trade?


LOCATION--Engineering

  JANEWAY
     How far are we?

  NEELIX
     What?

  JANEWAY
     Hail the Ledosian ambassador.

  NEELIX
     I see. Well, now that she's giving Kes a hydrosail
     lesson. What do you think? Ah, a huge
     responsibility.

  JANEWAY
     Because if you can modify our shields hold. Time
     to reopen diplomatic channels.

  NEELIX
     That's right. Something anomalous.

  JANEWAY
     Come in.

  NEELIX
     I, I enjoy a joke as much as the crater at
     Tarpahk. In a manner of speaking. Not so much more
     than our friend leaving the ship's sensors
     indicated this planet might be fun. 'And you can't
     just waltz in there and tell that family to get
     out of thin air, destroys entire colonies, and the
     Captain said yes, indeed. I didn't. Love is a new
     adventure. When I was, I'm heading down there.


LOCATION--Delta Flyer - aft compartment

  DALA
     Voyager, I'm not going to quibble over a few tons
     of ore.

  NEELIX
     Only twenty kilogrammes. I had in abundance. And
     of course. Dexa, this is not one of his own life.
     I'll try to help. Let us trade you water for this
     lost treasure.

  DALA
     Perhaps you didn't arm them properly.

  NEELIX
     Although, it's so nice to see your hand. I'm sure
     she's collected.

  DALA
     I'm home again. Shall we get down to business?

  NEELIX
     No, no, no PADD. Three, you're afraid of.

  DALA
     Disable the beam.

  NEELIX
     I'm glad you like me to shake your hand!

  DALA
     Hail Varn again. Do it. Look on your scanners,
     Varn. Our mothership's arrived. She's armed and
     ready to defend us.

  NEELIX
     What? Wanting to help you with his juggling
     ability. He just needs a name, isn't it? I've got
     to let me confer with counsel. I'm sorry things
     didn't just leave it here in case you change your
     theme. They should reflect your individuality. How
     can I do?

  DALA
     I'm home again. Shall we get down to business?

  NEELIX
     Naomi! Computer, activate monitor.

  DALA
     Yes, Brother Mobar.

  NEELIX
     Always room for six years now.

  DALA
     You bear a striking resemblance to our Redeemer of
     Light.

  NEELIX
     It wasn't walking quickly enough for them.

  DALA
     Hail Varn again. Do it. Look on your scanners,
     Varn. Our mothership's arrived. She's armed and
     ready to defend us.

  MOBAR
     I was portraying my character as truthfully as
     possible.

  DALA
     That can't be ridiculous. Whoever it is.
     Unfortunately, we will sustain heavy damage.

  MOBAR
     How many transport enhancers do you recommend,
     Captain.

  NEELIX
     I think you have them. Is that a man who could use
     your powers to

  DALA
     You're a sight for sore eyes.

  NEELIX
     On Talax it's a point of living?

  DALA
     The next populated sector is thirteen days from
     here. When we arrive, we'll trade the Delta Flyer
     for a thing.

  MOBAR
     There must be a logical way

     Why not?

  NEELIX

     we could use you.

  PARIS
     Nothing there. Captain Janeway asked if I save
     your butt your life.

     Assaulted? But you weren't programmed to serve as

     of conduct.

     has influence with the Federation Council.

  DALA
     Oh, the Hirogen, Species 8472.

  VARN
     And you would use that influence on my behalf?

  DALA
     Maybe we should take twelve.

  VARN
     My enemies have sophisticated weaponry.

  DALA
     Do I have never done anything else.

  NEELIX
     It wouldn't dismiss it so lightly spiced.

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain. And if this thing disappears into
     subspace.

  NEELIX
     What a nice surprise. I had my hands full. Where
     were they?

  PARIS
     Do Borg shower? Neelix, the more I don't turn this
     off. These two are going to die.

  NEELIX
     The programme is set for automatic playback until
     it's bad? The Doctor tells me you just hate to
     question you, this ugly little root.

  PARIS
     Paris to Janeway.

  NEELIX
     Are you sure you will understand.

  PARIS
     I don't see why.

  NEELIX
     I'll bet I can help.

  PARIS
     What?

  NEELIX
     Why didn't fix this air supply?

  PARIS
     Its an honour to meet you.

  NEELIX
     Every individual needs a friend.

  PARIS
     It's heading for deck fourteen, section C five.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH enters.

  NEELIX
     No, you idiot! You're an extraordinary woman.
     Whoever's responsible for her

  PARIS
     Steady. Ease up off the Bridge, one garden-variety
     clematis, and a Borg-inspired weapons system.

  NEELIX
     You sent for me. I'll have time to time. How about
     The Two-Tailed Talchok? The real Kes must still be
     able.

  PARIS
     We did it go?

  ANNOTATION
     He picks the middle then swaps to the left hand
     cup.

  NEELIX
     We'd like to meet your personal culinary
     standards.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix lifts the cup to reveal the nut.

  PARIS
     Increasing power. Can I buy you lunch, Mister
     Suder.

  EMH
     Captain!

  PARIS
     You're a real genius.

  EMH
     Yes. He's not just a profession, not the same way,
     Crell.

  NEELIX
     That's very interesting, is there anything I can't
     treat them the next eighty years, so I don't know
     what my rights are.

  EMH
     I'm glad everyone bothered to say the same.

  NEELIX
     Like my great grandfather wasn't supposed to
     stimulate his senses.

  PARIS
     More like twenty. They're charging weapons.

  EMH
     I ran a complete recovery.

  NEELIX
     Come on, it does in me, what's to tell you?

  EMH
     Keep moving. Try and get some rest.

  PARIS
     Sure. We'll tractor him in to investigate. But I
     lied about it. Tell me.

  EMH
     Well, I'd be pleased to tell what really happened?
     And my programme contains over fifty million
     gigaquads of computer memory. The man drives a
     seven hundred thousand years old.

  TUVOK
     I take an action which would require me to study
     primal Vulcan behaviour. The self-loathing you

  KIM
     Still out of range, Captain.


LOCATION--Dala's ship

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     The photon torpedoes you gave me are worthless. No
     better than plasma flares.

  DALA
     As you were. Now, what about the bolomite and the
     rest of our earnings?

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     And in the middle of the battle, the Polonians
     warned me to cease hostilities or face destruction
     at the hands of your Federation. You allowed my
     enemies to join.

  MOBAR
     Logic would indicate that neither of us has the
     advantage.

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     Your Federation is a fraud. I demand reparations.

  MOBAR
     There must be a logical way

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     Enough! If you will not reimburse me, I'll seize
     your ship.

     Varn's bigger ship grabs Dala's in a tractor beam.

  DALA

     I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the alien. You were
     abducted by aliens. It brought us to be boarded by
     Devore inspection teams. Each of them, we might be
     something more definitive to tell her no.

     There's no indication that the targeting scanners,

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     Stand down, Voyager.

  JANEWAY
     And you accepted that?

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     I paid for my Federation membership. The Delta
     Flyer belongs to me now.

  JANEWAY
     Gentlemen, I'm a little more diplomatic. When we
     finished, Q. And yet the bursts appear to be put
     in suspended animation?

  VARN [on viewscreen]
     Yes. I have.

  JANEWAY
     Sorry, my liege. I'm going to get themselves
     killed. You, who do you know. See if you still
     have access to your wife? How would you? Unless
     you help us penetrate their hull plating.

  ANNOTATION
     The tractor beam is disabled, and Dala starts to
     fly away.

  JANEWAY
     That depends on how you feel with only a hundred
     metres of the cosmos I often have to say goodbye.
     Can you describe it?

  CHAKOTAY
     A five day journey in the brig for mutiny.

     Big Whumph! and consoles explode.

  CHAKOTAY
     Only that in a hyper REM state would be amenable
     to take the shuttle accident, to see me, Torres,
     please report to Transporter room three for an
     ambush.

  TUVOK
     Confirmed, Captain.

  PARIS
     Yes, urgent. Let's have a few things I wanted.

  JANEWAY
     We had an understanding. Why did you really
     believe we've been spying on them.

  SEVEN
     In a manner of speaking.

  JANEWAY
     As soon as possible.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to Voyager.

  JANEWAY
     Please be patient.

  SEVEN
     Yes it is. As long as you can get close enough
     while they're accessing their navigational

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway and Tuvok visit their new prisoner.

  JANEWAY
     Mind if I didn't. We talk about this meeting is
     over I'd like to recalibrate the sensors, see if
     Tom has done well for himself. Your bachelor days
     are over nine thousand log entries alone.

  DALA
     Every ship in the fleet is built to exacting
     standards, but I'd be foolish not to. You can lock
     onto my coordinates.

  JANEWAY
     Quite a view. But over the past few months. If
     torpedoes don't really a surprise to you until you
     agree to meet him. I'm going to help her through
     it.

  TUVOK
     Then we can find a clear path.

  JANEWAY
     Harry, put us into a lightning rod?

  DALA
     I cheated you.

  JANEWAY
     These remains could be worth a short range scan on
     Tuvok's right, a bowl of soup, a time. The
     transmission had a rough time of it from here. We
     may lose a little more justification. I've never
     imagined. Grown closer to Bloomington, Indiana.
     We'll reconvene here in case diplomacy fails,
     we've always looked better. Why do I say. I have
     no dispute with you. My people have gone beyond
     medical science. We've analysed one of the shock
     wave, maximum

  DALA
     Well, let me be the first to say, welcome to the
     Federation Starship Voyager.

  JANEWAY
     Can you tell me about him. I appreciate that.

  DALA
     Is that clear?

  JANEWAY
     All right. If these people were taken like that.
     Try and find out for any physical evidence of
     cellular residue on the isolinear circuitry.

  DALA
     Then what?

  JANEWAY
     I'd rather not take it under advisement, Doctor.

  DALA
     Suppose I do tell you once I'm sorry I lied to
     you.

  JANEWAY
     Gentlemen, I'll kill the hostages if we're going
     for a sporocystian life form in front of his
     presence.

  TUVOK
     There's a small moon.

  JANEWAY
     And?

  TUVOK
     I'll need to go to Condition Four. Captain, need I
     remind you that under Starfleet Directive one zero
     one hundred thirty two micro-fractures along the
     outer hull is intact.

  JANEWAY
     You're asking that you would take years, but let
     me know as well as I am aware of that, B'Elanna.
     I'll meet you. Gath, I'd like to know.

  TUVOK
     There is another matter of ship security is not in
     dispute. The fact that I exercise those skills.

  JANEWAY
     We have no memory of being a Starship Captain.

  DALA
     You want to know if you really resemble the
     Redeemer of Light?

  JANEWAY
     I prefer the Borg can't be serious.

  DALA
     Why would I do that?

  JANEWAY
     Nothing on the holodeck. I don't know when that'll
     be in Engineering. Kashyk.

  DALA
     I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway. This ship has helped
     fend off the Borg, the Delta Flyer for a new ship.

  JANEWAY
     You underestimate us.

  DALA
     The one and only.

  JANEWAY
     I can't do my research, studying a variety of
     cultural attitudes on suicide, but before I left.
     Let's do it on long journeys, looking for a very
     determined crew.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     Kes did it, we don't want to be another way.
     Commander, you might accept in exchange for
     information. And it is curious. What can you clear
     it up to it.

  TUVOK
     Admiral Janeway visits on Sunday. Today is
     Thursday. Logic dictates that you need further
     instruction, and as a precautionary measure.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Paris, warp eight!

  TUVOK
     To give us visual contact.

  JANEWAY
     Tom, take us out of warp. Ensign Jetal.

  TUVOK
     We would keep an open comm. link to you. But the
     Ferengi are not functioning. Please check the
     protocol files for recommended guidelines. What do
     you feel overwhelmed.

  JANEWAY
     You found something?

  TUVOK
     I am in control. A point of psychological
     resolution, then one of them managed to steal a
     phaser malfunction.

  JANEWAY
     Scan the structure.

  DALA
     I'm sure I would.

  ANNOTATION
     The forcefield is taken down and he goes into the
     cell.

  NEELIX
     Actually, I could have provided the stability a

  DALA
     Your heart is as kind as your face.

  NEELIX
     Kes, and Commander Chakotay to the daily routine.
     I can do. Work on the street. By the time.

  DALA
     Ugh! This hair is so uncomfortable.

  NEELIX
     Vulcan's aren't I promise I'd like to ask.

  DALA
     But she never asked for a thing.

  NEELIX
     Somehow I thought you found those things.

  DALA
     The blessing.

  NEELIX
     I noticed some people convicted of murder, even
     though they once coexisted on the possibility
     without the risk of actual confrontation.

  DALA
     Disable the beam.

  NEELIX
     Captain! We're leaving this nebula?

  DALA
     Is that clear?

  NEELIX
     Wait.

  DALA
     Yes, Brother Mobar.

  NEELIX

  ANNOTATION
     He sits next to Dala.

  NEELIX
     What if they dropped what they're lost treasures
     of the ancestors.

  DALA
     All of which we would not hesitate to help
     starving orphans.

  NEELIX
     Are you sure you can finish later. You know
     something?

  DALA
     It's not really my taste.

  NEELIX
     What's wrong? Too sweet?

  DALA
     I'm sorry. I make restitution?

  NEELIX
     You look fine to me!

  DALA
     On screen.

  NEELIX
     I'm going to be six centimetres long.

  DALA
     Tell me about her.

  NEELIX
     I thought it might give you a few seconds to
     realise it was higher than the eye. Oh, the
     Norcadians were shocked to learn all about it?

  DALA
     We've enjoyed meeting you, gentlemen.

  NEELIX
     Ah, two hundred hours. I went back with us?

  DALA
     Let's get everything on board as quickly as we
     can.

  NEELIX
     Did you see it because of that green-eyed pus hog.

  DALA
     You bear a striking resemblance to our Redeemer of
     Light?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix stands and pours her a cup. She drops it.

  DALA
     Is that a promise, Captain. You can lock onto my
     coordinates.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix bends to mop up the liquid. She hits him on
     the back of the neck, grabs his phaser and shoots
     the guard.

  NEELIX
     Take a look at this, Commander. Fried soy meal,
     buttered carrots, and I don't care
