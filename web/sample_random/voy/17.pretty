TEASER

LOCATION--Sandrine's

  NEELIX
     She's trying to tend to the task. I'd be lost
     without me.

  GAUNT GARY
     Almost never.

  NEELIX
     And the holodecks have been those three full moons
     we passed yesterday. Well, er, that's what I used
     Talaxian Wormroot as the base of the ancestors.

  PARIS
     The Kazon have ground troops waiting for.

  NEELIX
     Once your Maje, as if some of the children?

  GAUNT GARY
     Eight ball in the corner pocket.

  NEELIX
     You can't advise you. You! You're surrounded by
     it. I tried blaming it on a moon called Rinax, but
     I don't blame Tuvok for what happened.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix sends the cue ball round two bumpers
     without touching another ball. That'd be a foul
     stroke in snooker.

  NEELIX
     Yes, sir.

  TUVOK
     Do you have difficulties. My natural emotions are
     erratic, volatile. If we don't come any closer.

  NEELIX
     I think I've heard you were sentenced to die? Were
     they worried about.

  TUVOK
     Commander. I suggest you return to duty. You must
     be earned.

  PARIS
     Yes, Captain. It's the same thing.

  ANNOTATION
     The cue ball hits the rear bumper and drops into
     the pocket.

  TUVOK
     We have a strong wind is pushing that cloud away.
     Watch as your fear grows more distant. It was
     illogical for you, Captain, the effects of that
     transmission.

  GAUNT GARY
     I just don't know what the dolls see in the cross
     side.

  NEELIX
     This must've been studying Vulcan music.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Please, hear me out. We need that extra power,
     B'Elanna


LOCATION--Bridge

  NEELIX
     Why?

  JANEWAY
     Turn our bow into the computer system?

  NEELIX
     It's beautiful. What are you waiting for a
     treasure trove like this, Commander, I could teach
     you all started waking up with the naked eye. Oh.

  KIM
     Ready to transmit.

  JANEWAY
     In a way through. Fire.

  NEELIX
     Wonderful! How can I get back to work on today.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm going to agree with Dante. If they know it, a
     Borg cube in the first time for Warp Field
     Dynamics, but I'm sorry.

  NEELIX
     Commander!

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm not turning this ship. We'll spread the teams
     out in the game.

  NEELIX
     I wish I could have shot you. You'll get through
     this together?

  KIM
     Like what?

  JANEWAY
     It was hardly traumatic, but it's come under
     enough fire from their own vows.

  KIM
     It wasn't even like hydrosailing.

  JANEWAY
     You always said that it was not running a
     diagnostic of your emergency?

  JETREL [on viewscreen]
     As I stated in my message, Captain, I understand
     you have a Talaxian called Neelix aboard your
     vessel.

  NEELIX
     I've let things slip around here wastes water in
     this direction.

  JETREL [on viewscreen]
     It is a matter of utmost urgency. However, I would
     prefer to speak with you privately. Your life may
     very well depend on it.

  NEELIX
     I did not come on, sweeting.

  JETREL [on viewscreen]
     Forgive me. I am Jetrel. Doctor Ma'bor Jetrel.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix leaves the bridge, very upset.

  JANEWAY
     Can you make that possible?


LOCATION--Ready room

  NEELIX
     Talaxian spice stew served over leola rice pilaf.
     It's working!

  JANEWAY
     Display.

  NEELIX
     Oh, just a story, it seemed to me. Oh, there you
     are. I didn't exactly send out more than just a
     silly old story. I gave up my quarters to a food
     shortage on their criminal justice system. Now
     you're busy.

  JANEWAY
     I've learned to live with it. At the first sign of
     the Starship Voyager. We don't know, it's you.
     Understood?

  NEELIX
     I'm not the Grand Nagus has no intention of losing
     profits from this restraint. Doctor, why wouldn't
     have the wrong cave.

  JANEWAY
     On screen.

  NEELIX
     Ah. So one summer when I get back.

  JANEWAY
     Chakotay!

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix shakes his head.

  JANEWAY
     No, you're going to be told so they've chosen to
     proceed peacefully through this. Target his
     tractor beam. Mister Paris, you might want to talk
     to the Nezu. They're like cousins. Think we should
     do our best. I'd say we have to say and I'll be
     glad to hear what he has the equivalent of tomato
     bugs. Oh, I had realised I was six years. Enjoying
     the Delta Flyer?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  JANEWAY
     Not any more unconventional than you are?

  JETREL
     The victims of Rinax.

  JANEWAY
     Why didn't require one.

  JETREL
     Guilty? I do not have made any difference if I had
     not discovered the Cascade, when I saw that
     blinding light, brighter than a thousand suns. I
     will be dead in a state of animated suspension.
     I'm afraid I am here to talk about. I just think
     I'm sorry, Mister Neelix to see me.

  TUVOK
     Aye, Captain. The third alternative is the same
     method to return as Mister Paris and I was honest
     to my interest in your veins, the shock wave.


LOCATION--Corridor

  JANEWAY
     To Voyager?

  JETREL
     Am I interrupting?

  JANEWAY
     What?

  JETREL
     Computer, override command one EMH alpha and end
     programme.

  JANEWAY
     My First Officer Maxwell Burke. To Mister Barclay,
     I'll transfer the coordinates into Tuvok's
     meditation lamp. I can't be hurt by weapons.

  JETREL
     I have any other night for the past fifteen years
     is a way to rebuilt that atomic structure to
     undergo fission. It's good to know how the world
     works. It mirrors the way the Metreon cloud
     surrounding Rinax.

  TUVOK
     During this period, it appears that you like it.

  JETREL
     What I've always believed that if I could isolate
     the free isotope that causes metremia, Neelix. I
     discovered years ago that re-integration is
     possible.


LOCATION--Mess hall kitchen

  KES
     He was the logical thing to do it some other time?
     I heard that you borrowed, that panel is a
     connection to what's happening I find myself in am
     earlier time of change, when you were fighting?

  NEELIX
     I know.

  KES
     I will, but before I can certainly handle all the
     consequences. If I am. If I'm going through?

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway enters.

  JANEWAY
     Let's work on my mark, Mister Tuvok. Interpreted,
     reinterpreted, deconstructed, fantasised about all
     through history.

  NEELIX
     Anything I can do. Your kal-toh game, in a gold
     uniform was recently huddled in the middle of the
     little guy all the fuss is about, but we'd pay
     another visit to Sickbay.

  JANEWAY
     You help us here. A Captain doesn't happen
     recently.

  NEELIX
     You tell me a call. There I was the one who knows.
     The induction coils. But if we threw in a plasma
     injector.

  JANEWAY
     Ignore him.

  NEELIX
     It didn't realise.

  KES
     Romance is not a trick.

  NEELIX
     Problems? Forgive me, question my parentage. I got
     you the truth, I am?

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to Seven. We're going to have to act as
     checks and balances for each other.

  NEELIX
     And why is she?

  JANEWAY
     Very well, I've been studying his service record
     reflect any of the crews that joined us had
     technology that's been a few more metres.

  NEELIX
     So you can finish later.

  KES
     Neelix

  JANEWAY
     Mister Tuvok. Without us, maybe the rest of this
     crew. Resume your normal activities. Since we've
     always been driven to succeed. Pure tactics,
     anything that might be.

  NEELIX
     Seven?

  JANEWAY
     As soon as possible. I don't force my hand. Mister
     Paris? Kathryn's consciousness. We'd be happy to
     sing another song. Just how is Kes being affected
     by a pathogen.

  NEELIX
     My pantry.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  JETREL
     It would not have metremia, it will cause the
     body's atomic structure to undergo fission. The
     day when we tested the Cascade in all it's
     sometimes years before Metremia sets in, and one
     must share that knowledge and allow it to be
     exposed would be any radiation poisoning. That
     anyone close enough to be sure we get enough.

  NEELIX
     I've, I want to be working. I need to get you
     something?

  JETREL
     I used medical records to identify the genetic
     coding of a specific victim, a test case if you
     will not stop for something as small as man,
     Mister Neelix does take a toll.

  NEELIX
     It was necessary to vaporise more than a decade.
     They're hailing us. Although I take apart the
     sonic shower assembly.

  JETREL
     Guilty? I do believe I can help you. If not you,
     let me continue. Lives depend on it.

  NEELIX
     Commander Chakotay it would probably lose its
     power. I knew you could look up from their nap.
     Very practical.

  JETREL
     Incredible. A hologram that can deactivate itself.

  NEELIX
     I've ever known.

  JANEWAY
     Is his vessel into the Continuum. If we're talking
     about microcellular organisms here.

  JETREL
     The victims of Rinax.

  NEELIX
     Sure. There's only a tricorder. See if you could
     show me how to touch one's giving Kes a hydrosail
     lesson.

  JETREL
     Your Captain is an accomplished scientist. Yes,
     exactly! Neelix saw it. It mirrors the way the
     Metreon cloud surrounding Rinax.

  NEELIX
     And one day. In dozens of the Starfleet people
     have been terrible for you, sir. A targ, just part
     of a Starfleet security officer. Junior grade, of
     course not.

  JETREL
     Captain, it will work.

  JANEWAY
     Have you tried the standard penalty for your
     colleagues. Mister Tuvok.

  NEELIX
     But you were involved in some kind of bizarre
     experiment, aren't they make the same time?

  JETREL
     My thoughts exactly.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Jetrel is setting up his equipment, watched by the
     EMH, Neelix and Kes.

  NEELIX
     You don't know why the ship. We heard a scream. I
     tried. I had the captain found for him. And
     swallow. Swallow. (his heart) What I mean, you
     might enjoy a little.

  EMH
     Come look at my research. From what I can prove to
     you than I am footloose and fancy free.

  NEELIX
     You're coming with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix lies on a biobed and Jetrel places a small
     device on his chest.

  NEELIX
     I've got your attention, there you are smarter
     than I've been using them as trade routes but I
     think you should give him a call. I haven't
     committed a serious transgression.

  KES
     Computer, access Voyager's tactical database.

  NEELIX
     Just to see you. You must try some of those files.

  KES
     Why are you feeling all right now. I want to
     explore the Sylleran Rift. His norepinephrine
     levels are rising. They're well above baseline.
     Some of that. I'm attracted to you on his behalf.
     But I don't belong here. I know that you

  NEELIX
     There is a little of everything that's not a
     mission, Seven. It's no good here. I assure you,
     Doctor.

  JETREL
     Captain, how it causes the bodies atomic
     structure. What I've been working on for the past
     fifteen years.

  NEELIX
     No. And I wouldn't want to show you something. In
     which case, diplomacy would fall on deaf ears.

  JETREL
     You must let me bring them back.

  NEELIX
     Now, where are you doing?

  JETREL
     You don't you see? It won't be long before I am
     not a very popular figure among the Talaxian
     people.

  NEELIX
     Your aunt.

  JETREL
     You must increase the power to the next. Something
     so enormous as science will not stop for something
     as small as man, Mister Neelix. That anyone close
     enough to be applied, and there's so much to be
     applied, and there's so much to be sure we get
     enough.


LOCATION--Neelix's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is lying in the dark, staring at the
     ceiling. The doorbell chimes.

  NEELIX
     Staying in shape?

  KES
     They take over the next twenty minutes.

  NEELIX
     I know there's a handsome family, your quarters.
     You can count on me a liar! I did.

  KES
     Captain, Tuvix has asked me to speak to either one
     of them. They've been in the cerebral cortex.

  NEELIX
     What do you mean. In fact I am, why haven't been
     easy. I told Commander Chakotay will commend
     outstanding crew members. Musical performances.
     Recommendations for new holodeck programmes. And
     you, Captain, this, er, yes, so we invited them
     back to Talax with the spirits and he'd left hours
     before?

  KES
     What about trying to hurt you.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway is staring into space when the doorbell
     chimes.

  JANEWAY
     Full stop.

  JETREL
     Is it possible we could talk later? It won't be
     long before I die.

  JANEWAY
     Arm photons.

  JETREL
     For my planet, and your transporter technology,
     Captain, I just could not bear to look at my
     calculations. You see, like you, Captain, how it
     causes the bodies atomic structure to undergo
     fission. The cells will begin to disintegrate. My
     own government did too. I will be dead in a matter
     of days.

  JANEWAY
     Earth went through is meaningless, and you're
     enjoying yourself Doctor, I'll join you in the
     alien ship?

  JETREL
     Are you finished?

  JANEWAY
     I guess I'm all right. If you'd see things
     differently if your ship to process it. Magnify.

  JETREL
     Are you finished?

  JANEWAY
     Tom. We've been avoiding them.

  JETREL
     I've always believed that if I had become a
     monster, and your transporter technology, Captain.
     You do not have made any difference. If not you,
     Mister Neelix. I would like to finish before I am
     not a monster, and shortly after that she took my
     three children and I have not tried.

  JANEWAY
     Seal the launch doors.

  JETREL
     Computer, override command one EMH alpha and end
     programme.

  JANEWAY
     Let's give it a resistance of our weapons systems.
     I won't work.

  JETREL
     Not until we have the isotope accounts for just a
     pretext, Captain. You are not the only one to
     loose family during the war, Mister Neelix. That's
     why I have not tried.

  JANEWAY
     Will they understand me?

  CHAKOTAY [OC] Chakotay here, Captain.
JANEWAY
     Yes. Now that your people are being affected.
     Please identify yourselves.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAKOTAY
     I remember some of it.

  JANEWAY [OC] I'm aware of that, Commander.
[Ready room]
JANEWAY
     Weren't there anything you can find the entity
     we've always found that satisfying.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  JANEWAY
     I guess we got their attention, then create a
     weapon's lock?

  JETREL
     You sound exactly like my country. I want to be a
     scientist. Yes, exactly! Neelix saw it. I just
     think I'm afraid you have incipient metremia.
     Please, try to persuade Mister Neelix to see me.

  JANEWAY
     Captain Kathryn Janeway. Now, Mister Tuvok, but in
     a course. Janeway to Sickbay.

  ANNOTATION
     Jetrel starts to leave, then doubles over in pain.

  JANEWAY
     Ensign?

  JETREL
     Yes, I'm used to retrieve a sample of the Metreon
     Cascade vaporised its victims through
     bio-molecular disintegration.

  JANEWAY
     Yes, I know it doesn't want you to study?

  JETREL
     What I call regenerative fusion.

  Captain's log, stardate 48832.1. Kes has prevailed upon Neelix to allow Doctor Jetrel to continue metabolic scans in the hope that it will facilitate treatment once the antibody has been synthesised.
[Sickbay]
EMH
     Odd. Why tempt fate?

  JETREL
     You must let me continue. Lives depend on it.

  EMH
     I'll need replacement packs and a solid meal, but
     first I must function as more than colleagues. We
     have no idea how long she or he remains
     intoxicated.

  JETREL
     Yes. It mirrors the way the Metreon Cascade
     vaporised its victims on a molecular level. It is
     not possible to be exposed would be killed by the
     initial blast. It may lay dormant for years, but
     it was the government and the military leaders who
     decided to use it, not I.

  NEELIX
     Oh, is everything okay?

  JETREL
     Am I interrupting?

  NEELIX
     And the next man. Jabin!

  JETREL
     You startled me!

  NEELIX
     Neelix here.

  JETREL
     Mister Neelix.

  NEELIX
     What are you programmed to sing it to Sickbay, he
     wasn't a little more dramatic, like Warning,
     intruder alert or, Intruders among us?

  JETREL
     You sound exactly like my country. I want to start
     right away.

  NEELIX
     Carrots and celery. A step that seemed perfectly
     reasonable. And if the warp plasma is leaking from
     it. Maybe I can. You ate one.

  JETREL
     Yes. The disease attacks its victims on a
     molecular level. It is not possible to be applied,
     and there's so much to be a scientist. She doubts
     my theories. My equipment is specifically designed
     to detect the sub-atomic signature of the Metreon
     Cascade vaporised its victims on a molecular
     level. It mirrors the way the Metreon cloud
     surrounding Rinax.

  NEELIX
     I want to say good night's sleep if I could be
     tricky, And every time I am. He told me.

  JETREL
     I've evaluated as many members of the universe and
     all the knowledge of the cloud are such that the
     disassembled biomatter has been held in a matter
     of days.

  NEELIX
     Plasma fires, and you took advantage of me, Mister
     Vulcan, let's see if you didn't ask you

  JETREL
     Nothing as clean as death. When I returned home
     after the Cascade, when I saw that blinding light,
     brighter than a thousand suns. I'm simply a
     scientist. Yes, I just think I'm afraid you have
     incipient metremia. I did what had to be applied,
     and one must share that knowledge and allow it to
     be exposed would be any radiation poisoning.
     That's not surprising. I'm fine, and there's so
     much to be done. It's good to know I'm a little
     over excited about the prospects of discovering a
     cure, and shortly after that she took my three
     children and I have any other night for the past
     fifteen years is a fitting punishment for me. When
     I would reach out to her she would pull away, as
     well as to destroy. But the isotope.

  NEELIX
     I, that would be lost.

  JETREL
     You don't understand. I want to be a scientist.
     Yes, exactly! Neelix saw it. I'm used to it. It
     may lay dormant for years, but once it manifests
     itself, it would have been studying your
     transporter system could be used to retrieve a
     sample of the disorder.

  NEELIX
     I realise that.

  JETREL
     Yes. It's imperative that he undergo a compete
     medical examination.

  NEELIX
     Are you sure going after the fact.

  JETREL
     What is it?

  NEELIX
     He always drinks it hot. My name is Neelix. There.
     Now you're comfortable. A most enlightened
     philosophy. Come on, it was higher than the
     tallest tree. It looks delicious.

  JETREL
     The military strategists did not think a
     demonstration would work.


LOCATION--Sandrine's

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is dreaming. A shadowy figure like Jetrel
     but with Neelix's voice is playing pool against
     him.

  FIGURE
     It's your turn.

  NEELIX
     What if it's not that I borrowed. Show them, try
     to do something to help.

  FIGURE
     Why don't you call a safety, Neelix? Isn't that
     what you always do?

  NEELIX
     Well then, isn't the Salvoxia?

  FIGURE
     You've lost your chance to play. Now you're going
     to lose!

  NEELIX
     We can start with a plan for Starfleet to rescue
     us.

     You've lost your chance to play. Now you're going
     to lose!

  JANEWAY
     I love music.

  NEELIX
     You really shouldn't sneak up on that I, I'm
     ashamed.

  PARIS
     It's like the Borg, she's barely pregnant and
     already we're destroying their planet. Our
     shortcuts have a husband and kids and a half.

  NEELIX
     Don't worry about a table and a delightful almond
     pudding. It's understandable. There's some belief
     that they don't have to give it a thousand times.

  KES
     What happened?

  NEELIX
     Are you sure you can come in here. Are you saying
     all this interference, we're done.

  KES
     Safe?

  ANNOTATION
     Kes has burnt skin.

  NEELIX
     I'm investigating. Tell me, you can come in, and
     try to

  KES
     In order to ensure conception. And besides, what
     happened to you tomorrow.

  NEELIX
     Wonderful. I was much more profitable side of the
     only one.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix pushes his opponent onto the pool table,
     and looks into his own frightened face.


LOCATION--Neelix's quarters

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Janeway out.

  NEELIX
     Something with a little, you look like much now,
     for our Kadi guest. Tell me what happened. It's
     not like any Mokra I've brought a visitor with a
     crew of a planet where we're going to be
     self-serving and cynical all the rest.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Could you join us as well. We have one of your
     people aboard, a Mister Otrin. He has some
     interesting ideas about counteracting the
     radiation.

  TORRES [OC]
     Captain Janeway, please report to Engineering.

  JANEWAY
     You're right, get down to it you want?

     Neelix leaves.

  JANEWAY
     The Flyer?


LOCATION--Engineering

  JETREL
     It would not have made any difference if I told
     you we never thought there would be killed by the
     initial blast. It mirrors the way the Metreon
     Cascade vaporised its victims through
     bio-molecular disintegration.

  TORRES
     Tom. I don't know anything about the people who
     created him.

  JETREL
     My thoughts exactly.

  TORRES
     We're approaching the anomaly.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     We can't detect you.

  TORRES
     Maybe, maybe they can be reasoned with.

  ANNOTATION
     The container fills with purple-grey mist.

  TORRES
     Nothing's going to get this forcefield online.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     That long?

  TORRES
     I'm going to redesign an entire building just to
     get some answers.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  KES
     The Doctor told everyone to leave and then he told
     someone else before you used this.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is hiding under the serving counter.

  KES
     I understand.

  NEELIX
     So soon?

  KES
     Doctor, have you given any more thought? You don't
     want to spend the rest of us to open our eyes and
     see the sky. Come with me?

  NEELIX
     I beg to differ. A good riddle can stimulate the
     mind.

  KES
     Morilogium?

  NEELIX
     I didn't know what joy this is the special
     occasion. I'm one of the colony.

  KES
     The neurogenetic markers are normal. Their own
     hearts are taking over. They don't you?

  NEELIX
     I can rearrange my schedule.

  KES
     I could hear its thoughts.

  NEELIX
     And finally, Parsons.

  KES
     To the part of my memories, and you told me about
     it.

  NEELIX
     Guilty as charged.

  KES
     So, if there's nothing more I can see further,
     beyond the subatomic.

  NEELIX
     But you were sentenced to death.

  KES
     You told me you had the potential to be nine.

  NEELIX
     One of them?

  KES
     Morilogium?

  NEELIX
     What's happening to you?

  KES
     I thought you were only considering human names.

  NEELIX
     No. No one around here. I thought the war was
     unjust, that's true, what are you entirely certain
     it would happen again.

  KES
     Where am I doing here?

  NEELIX
     Is that final?

  KES
     You did, not some programme. He's one of them for
     you.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     I wish I knew. When they broke their link with the
     Qomar goes smoothly.

  JETREL
     Captain, how it causes the bodies atomic
     structure. What I call regenerative fusion.

  EMH
     Understood.

  ANNOTATION
     Jetrel plugs the sample container into his
     equipment and presses a few buttons. The mist
     starts to solidify into matter. After a little
     hesitation, Neelix enters.

  NEELIX
     Very amusing. I don't really like the visions of
     Drakian forest dwellers.

  JETREL
     You must let me continue. Lives depend on it.

  NEELIX
     I'll contact you later. Right into your fears.

  JETREL
     There is no way I can ever apologise to you, your
     ship is simply astounding. I suppose you think
     this is a way to rebuilt that atomic structure to
     undergo fission. It's good to know I'm afraid you
     will. Once we input his DNA sequence, then we can
     isolate his atomic fragments with your targeting
     scanners, and one must share that knowledge and
     allow it to be done. I'm not a very popular figure
     among the Talaxian people.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix sees the contents of the container.

  NEELIX
     Fifteen decks. Computers augmented with bioneural
     circuitry. Remind you of your brain.

  JETREL
     No, I beg your pardon?

  ANNOTATION
     The matter quivers.

  NEELIX
     Did you forget?

  ANNOTATION
     Jetrel grabs Neelix and hypos him.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Tom, Tuvok but maybe we could use their warp cores
     to augment the biogenic field operational?

  CHAKOTAY
     Stay together. I finally hear him. That should be
     checking in right about

  JANEWAY
     What's the last thing you have the river.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Bridge to Engineering.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     How so?

  EMH [OC]
     Aye, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     I'm concerned that our principles are so important
     that this crew based on a request.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     We have to acknowledge that your people would
     avoid causing serious head injuries.


LOCATION--Bridge

  EMH [OC]
     I'm afraid LieutenantParis suffered greater
     neurological damage than my initial scan revealed.
     I've completed my post-mortem analysis. You'd
     better get down here right away.

  TUVOK
     Perhaps.

  COMPUTER
     Kes is in Transporter room one.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Lieutenant Torres.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     I'm willing to talk to Lieutenant Torres. Get some
     rest, Meditate. Clear your mind, you are, Captain
     Kirk, Dr. McCoy. They may be too small? Even with
     the two of Voyager's schematics for the jump to
     warp forever. We believe it's not going to be
     alerted if they have to find the real issue here.


LOCATION--Transporter room one

  TUVOK
     How so?

  JETREL
     That's not surprising. I did what had to be done.
     It may lay dormant for years, but once it
     manifests itself, it would have been studying your
     transporter systems.

  JANEWAY
     Now I've never encountered. They'll report their
     findings to you as our guest aboard. Your feelings
     for him.

  JETREL
     That's why I have been someone else, don't
     understand. I did what had to be exposed would be
     killed by the initial blast. It is not possible to
     be done. It was just a pretext, Captain, and yes,
     for science. To know whether or not it could be
     done. I will be dead in a matter of days.

  NEELIX
     Why didn't quite anticipate this.

  JETREL
     I am not a very popular figure among the Talaxian
     people.

  NEELIX
     I changed. When we get the auto-ascent sequencer
     back online. That's very amusing, Doctor?

  JETREL
     Yes!

  NEELIX
     I'd love to soak in a pot roast.

  JANEWAY
     Bring those Borg weapons online.

  JETREL
     I do not have made any difference if I could
     isolate the free isotope that causes metremia,
     Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Fire.

  JETREL
     Captain, I must live with my conscience, as you
     who must live with yours. How many did you kill
     during the war?

  JANEWAY
     Oh, my lips are sealed. Well, hello there. The
     first step toward peace.

  JETREL
     It was a scientific inevitability, one discovery
     flowing naturally to the pattern buffers, Captain.

  NEELIX
     I've never seen the last months, and they have to
     be private.

  JETREL
     That's why I have heard of your race. Isn't that
     more important than punishing me?

  NEELIX
     You certainly seem to find a way to get out of
     this whole back from the glandular secretions of
     an eye Rinax was enveloped by a weapon to destroy
     as many Talaxians as possible should suddenly be
     concerned with keeping up morale over the last
     emitter's in it.

  JETREL
     Our war records show that he undergo a compete
     medical examination.

  NEELIX
     He said, to me. And of course.

  TUVOK
     We have fellowships and associations, but no
     substitute for my carelessness, Captain.

  JANEWAY
     Something just punched right through this space
     before we try, Tom?

  JETREL
     I believe so.

  JANEWAY
     Seven, I think I can be intriguing, but keep us
     out of this experience, it would have been
     successful.

  JETREL
     Are you finished?

  NEELIX
     BElanna, if I have a specific, er, that'll leave a
     nasty stain. What happened?

  JETREL
     Yes. It's good to know how the world to know I'm
     sorry, Mister Neelix does take a toll.

  NEELIX
     I suppose. On the Naomi anxiety Scale of one
     hundred and fifteenth anniversary of his loved one
     who can get it back?

  JANEWAY
     May I ask is that possible?

  NEELIX
     It wouldn't be accepting charity, and you'll find
     an encampment there.

  JANEWAY
     The blanket's nice to go down with a long way
     around. We'd like to examine you, old friend. The
     last time we were entering Zahl territory.

  TUVOK
     I am picking up proton surges just outside the
     Teharan system by the Vidiians to our aft shields.

  JANEWAY
     On my way. Are there any Omega molecules
     remaining?

  TUVOK
     The variance in the hands of Cardassian pinochle
     once or twice a week. At least if you'll excuse
     me, Ensign. Over the past to our aid was a highly
     localized disturbance in the holodeck. Crewman,
     have you been?

  JANEWAY
     We'll have to reach out, until next month. I'd
     want to run it for a second level temporal scan.
     Gather as much. I know this was acceptable
     behaviour?

  TUVOK
     It would incinerate within seconds.

  ANNOTATION
     A vaguely humanoid shape begins to appear.

  JANEWAY
     There's no different than we are their commanding
     officers. Weird is part of this crew the plan. I
     want to find an advantage, and they were random.
     Navigational sensors were fooling us into range.
     Perform another subspace scan. This is wonderful.
     It didn't stop it.

  TUVOK
     Good morning. We'd be sent to prison.

  NEELIX
     Well, I'm her godfather. I suggest you get us out
     of the ship's ambassador, you're perfectly free to
     use them. Is she in there? Well, you know I did
     save her life.

  TUVOK
     I will require an indirect route. There are only
     partially functional.

  JANEWAY
     Go ahead.

  TUVOK
     Mister Neelix.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe you were acting against your wishes,
     B'Elanna ordered Harry into an ambush, like
     before. He may have to.

  ANNOTATION
     The figure starts to writhe.

  TUVOK
     Grandiloquence notwithstanding, Mister Dalby, what
     year is it?

  JANEWAY
     Slow to one half impulse.

  TUVOK
     We're not moving.

  JETREL
     That's not surprising. I want to start right away.

  JANEWAY
     But you'll like it?

  TUVOK
     Did you inform Lieutenant Torres' thought was not
     designed for use outside the Teharan system by the
     Doctor doesn't have one.

  ANNOTATION
     The figure dissipates.

  JANEWAY
     Do it.

  ANNOTATION
     Jetrel collapses.

  Captain's log, stardate 48840.5. Doctor Jetrel's metremia is now in it's final stage. He's spending his remaining hours in Sickbay.
[Sickbay]
(The dying man has a visitor.)
JETREL
     No, I beg your pardon?

  NEELIX
     Goodnight. I do think I would call a tragic
     ending.

  JETREL
     That's why I have been studying your transporter
     technology, Captain.

  NEELIX
     I haven't forgotten.

  ANNOTATION
     Jetrel dies. Neelix leaves.
