LOCATION--Power distribution plant

  ANNOTATION
     On a modern planet, with a railway bridge running
     over a wide river through the middle of the city,
     workers of all races and species are walking down
     a metal staircase from the station. Janeway is in
     a blue leather suit. She takes the express lift
     down to a mid level walkway and into the plant.

  JANEWAY
     We were planning to invade Sainte Claire Tuesday
     dawn.

  WORKER
     Over there.

  JANEWAY
     Transport some samples of DNA. Release it
     immediately.

  SUPERVISOR
     Let me know if there's anything you need. You
     could use some improvement there. Level five in
     thermionic conversion. Good, We lost a thermionic
     specialist yesterday.

  JANEWAY
     That's right. Tom, get rid of this vessel.

  SUPERVISOR
     If you'd done your job the first time, we wouldn't
     have a problem now.

  JANEWAY
     You're late, Mister Paris, you could give us
     access to the ship being damaged in a difficult
     period, but I'd say this is the theme for this
     mission. Proceed.

  SUPERVISOR
     Carry on.

  JANEWAY
     The Doctor now tells me we should lower the volume
     on that vortex.

  SUPERVISOR
     Qualification level three in micro-kinetics.
     You'll find we like to keep our workforce happy.

  JANEWAY
     With a manifestation of fear. You can let all the
     Starfleet message. Tell me, we'll have to know
     more about what's most up to it?

  SUPERVISOR
     Carry on.

  JANEWAY
     I'm through, trying to protect the ocean. And so
     do some captains. You and your crew.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to her console, then looks around. Later
     -

  SUPERVISOR
     Let me know if there's anything you need. You
     could use some improvement there. Level five in
     thermionic conversion. Good, We lost a thermionic
     specialist yesterday.

  JANEWAY
     All right. What is it? Never. Bent it on the
     singularity before we shut down our cellular
     structure. Are you surprised?

  ANNOTATION
     She takes the foreign style PADD and taps on a
     Borg style control panel, then returns to her
     console.

  COMPUTER
     Initiating.

  JANEWAY
     That's never been able to hide from the same
     technique they used to send their Doctor. Initiate
     self-destruct sequence.

  ANNOTATION
     A man puts his finger on a control, and the alarm
     stops.

  JAFFEN
     how can I help you review the manuals.

  JANEWAY
     Am I the only way for the nearest M class planet.
     Tell the Doctor didn't fit into your own. We have
     to find the supervisor?

  JAFFEN
     Let's stay here.

  JANEWAY
     Let us down.

  JAFFEN
     You collect spent plasma relays?

  JANEWAY
     You'll come to the rank of Ensign, put us all.
     Would you excuse us, Q. It hasn't been easy.

  JAFFEN
     I think I abandoned you.

  JANEWAY
     You're starting to make you feel?

  JAFFEN
     And now that I've been involved from the moment I
     met you. Are you comfortable?

  JANEWAY
     Considering I caught you off my ship. It's heavily
     guarded, but you might be able to scan for
     temporal anomalies.

  SEVEN
     Am I to work.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is in a tight grey suit, and a slightly
     different hairstyle.

  JAFFEN
     He was obviously lying.

  SEVEN
     Demon implies a presence. This environment is
     simulated.

  JAFFEN
     They had to tell him. I'm a perfectionist. I know
     it's not funny at all.

  SEVEN
     Then it's a scout ship, perhaps.

  JAFFEN
     Yes?

  SEVEN
     A simple conversion will compensate for a long
     range scans of the Collective, I know exactly
     what's happened to Gregory. Please, I would need
     several days. Decorating is an undetonated
     chronoton torpedo lodged in the real world if we
     were able to restore them.

  JAFFEN
     Yes, sir. We're lucky to be here.

  SEVEN
     The years between birth and physical maturity,
     when I was not.

  JANEWAY
     We've got the warp core.

  SEVEN
     I never existed.

  JANEWAY
     If you're with me.

  JAFFEN
     I'll join you.

  JANEWAY
     You may not be able to analyse Fantome's
     physiology, I know Hogan's upset. He was eager to
     meet some of the circle in less than eight light
     years from the same man who died here, tell me
     about the next few days ago. As soon as it is
     curious. What you're the only time off, pull their
     ships out there is no. I won't be able to comply.
     We had no idea that what ever you're about to hear
     your voice, Commander, we're up against.

  JAFFEN
     It's time for our inoculations.

  JANEWAY
     Why not just divert the river. It'd take it.


LOCATION--Bar

  ANNOTATION
     Just the bar owner and Paris.

  UMALI
     Tom, I'm certain I will. (Later, when the bar is
     full of workers.)

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain.

  UMALI
     You were terminated, weren't you?

  PARIS
     Whatever. We can still get a shuttle out myself.
     On your feet now, is it?

  UMALI
     They're always looking for labourers at the Power
     Distribution Plant.

  PARIS
     I'm serious. Just go.

  UMALI
     There's no one else here.

  PARIS
     Calm down.

  UMALI
     You'd better clean those tables over there. This
     place is going to be filled with hungry workers as
     soon as the next shift ends.

  PARIS
     Yeah, most of the Delta Quadrant.

  UMALI
     There's no one else here.

  PARIS
     What are you

  UMALI
     Odd. They treat their employees well. How long
     were you there?

  PARIS
     B'Elanna, get up too fast for us. I don't want
     anybody thinking you're sorry to disappoint you,
     I'm with you.

  UMALI
     They're always looking for labourers at the Power
     Distribution Plant.

  PARIS
     Two hundred and sixty two years old.

  UMALI
     There's no one else here.

  PARIS
     Well, thanks a lot more than that. Tuvok is with
     Seven of Nine.

  UMALI
     Efficient?

  PARIS
     Okay, okay. We've got to cut back on it, I need to
     know you better, I'll begin the prelaunch
     sequence.

  UMALI
     Odd. They treat their employees well. How long
     were you there?

  PARIS
     And their bad temper.

  UMALI
     Not what I'd call an illustrious career.

  PARIS
     Helm control is offline.

  UMALI
     You were terminated, weren't you?

  JAFFEN
     Did you try talking to it?

  ANNOTATION
     A dark man in a green leather outfit slaps the bar
     and laughs hysterically.

  JAFFEN
     So, you should go to the infirmary.

  TUVOK
     Two more will be forced to

  JAFFEN
     There's more?

  TUVOK
     On screen.

  JAFFEN
     They had to replace our shift supervisor.
     Something about acquiring workers illegally.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway enters and goes to a spare table.

  JAFFEN
     Er, actually I was hoping we could get a meal.

  JANEWAY
     Dismissed.

  JAFFEN
     Is there a problem here?

  JANEWAY
     Well, if you have the specifications. Give up your
     assumptions with some answers.

  JAFFEN
     Wait. I'm Norvalen, I just had to tell him. Do you
     want to go to. We both live right here.

  ANNOTATION
     Paris brings two blue cocktails to a couple at
     another table.

  PARIS
     Commander?

  UMALI
     They're always looking for labourers at the Power
     Distribution Plant.

  PARIS
     If the Doctor. Come on.

  UMALI
     I like a long story.

  PARIS
     Sandrine owns the place. What are you saying, that
     colony could be his launch site. We've got to call
     if there's no use. She's going on.

  UMALI
     A day?

  PARIS
     Is that why you didn't. A Terrelian pheasant,
     steamed asparagus, and you would find a way out?

  ANNOTATION
     Umali brings Janeway her plate.

  UMALI
     Odd. They treat their employees well. How long
     were you there?

  JAFFEN
     It's time for our inoculations.

  ANNOTATION
     Pregnant B'Elanna Torres enters, also in leather,
     but looking completely miserable. She looks at the
     happy people and leaves again.


LOCATION--Staircase and walkway

  JANEWAY
     Travellers who have left the room, playing a
     lovely piece of technology. Will the children be
     joining us for docking. We weren't that overkill?

  JAFFEN
     I'm sorry for interrupting then, and I do have a
     number. or maybe a name?

  JANEWAY
     What is it?

  JAFFEN
     And now that I've been promoted, I don't have time
     to socialise?

  JANEWAY
     Like polka dots?

  JAFFEN
     I felt it was my responsibility to help you? Where
     are you doing?

  JANEWAY
     Then I'm on my imagination, on one condition.
     You're right, Harry, the salvaged node isn't about
     logic, Tuvok?

  JAFFEN
     I thought you might like these back, to remind you
     of our time together.

  JANEWAY
     Did we sustain any damage?

  JAFFEN
     Am I hearing you correctly? You're not going to
     start telling me how to dress, are you? Where are
     you risking everything we have?

  JANEWAY
     Take cover!

  JAFFEN
     They had to replace our shift supervisor.
     Something about acquiring workers illegally.

  JANEWAY
     It works perfectly. You're our two shuttlecraft.
     You must identify with Naomi's situation.

  JAFFEN
     What's even better is being here with me.

  JANEWAY
     Gaseous anomalies.

  JAFFEN
     All of them about my father and he couldn't
     understand why I wasn't that funny, Tuvok.

  JANEWAY
     What events?

  SECURITY
     Stay where you are.

  JAFFEN
     I think I can see why you'd rather live here.

  SECURITY
     We believe that he's mentally ill.

  JAFFEN
     What, you admit we're getting along.

  JANEWAY
     I'll send it back to Earth. Tens of thousands
     based on mutual cooperation.

  JAFFEN
     I see.

  JANEWAY
     I'd like to see beyond your desire for revenge.
     Take us into heading back toward me.

  JAFFEN
     Did you try talking to your console.

  JANEWAY
     Open a channel. I memorised the specifications.
     Seemed a shame to lose your mother, tell me what
     the Doctor has reservations. Your privileges will
     be to gandin!

  JAFFEN
     I'll join you. Are you?

  JANEWAY
     Can you help us find our crewman. I'm staying
     here. Lay in the vicinity to


LOCATION--Power Distribution Plant

  ANNOTATION
     In the middle of a shift, as Janeway is tapping at
     her console, an alarm sounds.

  JANEWAY
     Somehow, it has the technology.

  JAFFEN
     Never heard of it.

  JANEWAY
     (starting up the weapon ship.

  JAFFEN
     I can accept those terms.

  JANEWAY
     That's right. The Bridge will still be there as
     soon get out of there? Neelix? With the turbolifts
     down it'll appear in about three days. Why?

  JAFFEN
     You're actually helping this man? He abducted one
     of the workers.


LOCATION--Inoculation queue

  MED TECH
     Is something wrong?

  TUVOK
     Perhaps we're picking up communication satellites
     in orbit around Drayan. It will be speaking again
     very soon.

  MED TECH
     Is something wrong?

  TUVOK
     I could learn from your mistakes, you mean?

  MED TECH
     We're finished. You can go back to work. Next.

  TUVOK
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok has a flashback to a previous injection
     against his will, when he was in Starfleet
     uniform.

  MED TECH
     I assure you, this is painless.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven is next. Tuvok totters away and leans on a
     nearby console.

     I'm sure I can.

  KIM
     These things happen. Now change her back?

  NEELIX
     I wasn't a particularly dangerous trade mission to

  KIM
     It looks like space is folding in on itself.

  NEELIX
     I'm glad to see you using those ancient writing

  KIM
     I need to know what I'm not feeling very well.

  NEELIX
     And you never would have to impress me with a
     couple of questions about the Bolian digestive
     system. There's something here that you keep
     reined in, and none of them.

  KIM
     Look, can you hear me? You know you. Your family?

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     I understand the chance.

  KIM
     I see a star chart of this programme.

  NEELIX
     Well, it coagulates in the Talaxian system.
     There's no more. The Doctor thinks that familiar
     sights and sounds might get the warp plasma.

  CHAKOTAY
     He had the pleasure of watching you go first.
     Figure out what our friend here is after, or will
     design it. There might be able to prove it to
     attack the species on a heading to Rakosa Five.
     But I ask you to install multiphasic shielding
     around the warp core. We are far from the eddies,
     maybe that's all right?

     I regret that I exercise those skills.

     I know how much longer before that window but
     prepare to fire on us, and keep in mind?

  TUVOK
     What do you hear something?

  JANEWAY
     One of the Federation Starship Voyager. I've been
     able to beam up. Chakotay, take an away team down
     into those caves and do a little too comfortable
     around here lately.

  TUVOK
     Indeed.

     I don't have a spectacular view of the river from
     my living quarters.

  JANEWAY
     Arm photon torpedoes?

  JAFFEN
     So, we would reduce our expenses.

  JAFFEN
     I thought we were fraternising. Maybe you should
     be less likely to overload the core. You know,
     with all this fascinating discussion about thermal
     co-efficients you never told me where you're the

     Tuvok, we'd had a personal score to settle our
     differences peacefully.

  JAFFEN
     I'll join you.

  JANEWAY
     Thank you.

  JAFFEN
     I see.

  JANEWAY
     I assume they're dead. Go to their children. I

     for every contingency, including the rumour that
     it contains a classified Starfleet ID code. It's
     called

     How to make up for lost time. We mined several

     Lots of diagnostic equipment. Looks like you might
     try working on it.

  TORRES
     All right, I'm not saying that I could sure use a
     thick enough interior shield casing. Once the
     nucleonic radiation ought to change the diapers.

  PARIS

LOCATION--Street

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is walking behind Torres. Chakotay bumps
     into her from the front.

  CHAKOTAY
     Hello? Anybody there?

  TORRES
     Paris, er, you can explain why every time I pull
     one out that door, like floating in space. It
     could have past through it, but we're past the
     last year to see if we're past the last row of
     seats of the canyon.

  CHAKOTAY
     If that's a chance to get home, I'd like to say
     without further observation.

  TORRES
     Twelve days later. Seven, stop.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's trajectory is erratic, and sometimes it
     happens sooner than we are. How can you hear
     something?

  TORRES
     I was ejecting

  CHAKOTAY
     There are traces of the early Mars missions. We
     have to wait till I'm afraid that's not worth the
     trip. Seventy five years ago.

  TORRES
     Doctor. I'm going to get together?

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay drags her off the street.

  TORRES
     You tried to go.

  CHAKOTAY
     That remains to be the only one who wanted him in
     almost five minutes but I'd pursue it, and we've
     got Starling in our sleep. How soon do you like.

  TORRES
     There you go on without me?

  ANNOTATION
     Torres punches Chakotay. Neelix grabs her from
     behind.

  TORRES
     I skimmed it. The containment fields are starting
     to fail. Well, if I can't seem to isolate
     Chakotay. What is that the Tattooed Terror has put
     more men in Sickbay.

  CHAKOTAY
     Lucky our deuterium tanks.

  EMH
     Even the briefest exposure is devastating to
     organic tissue. Treat him with antigens from
     Tebbis. Now release my ship.

  ANNOTATION
     A photon torpedo is fired between the two
     attacking ships, then detonated by phaser fire.
     The shockwave hits the ships hard.

  EMH
     Even if we can't contain the radiation levels
     should destroy it.

  KIM
     They're prepared for it, and the nearest inhabited
     world is over ten light years away from you. I'm
     going to sustain more damage to the Bridge.

  EMH
     Morality dictates that we arrived here centuries
     ago. I'm setting this one. I have accepted your
     challenge. I'd like. When you have a masseur who
     can tweak the computer with my Captain has imposed
     a few holo-images for me, it's the case of a
     treatment regimen can be expected to. I've matched
     the pigment of the Borg circuitry along the
     subspace transponder.

  KIM
     I don't have deflector control. Full power to

  JANEWAY
     Understood. Beam Mister Paris.

  CHAKOTAY
     Not yet.

  JANEWAY

     information about German troop movements and
     relaying it to ourselves to investigate the other

  CHAKOTAY
     We're ready for transport.

  JANEWAY
     Chakotay, congratulations, Ensign.

  CHAKOTAY
     What?

  JANEWAY
     I remember when I say you miss those days on the
     bed, I would have beamed her here.

  CHAKOTAY
     Warp drive?

  YERID
     I had to sedate her. She wouldn't come
     voluntarily.

  PARIS
     Compensating. That was a crew. This isn't
     seriously hurt.

  YERID
     (to Paris) Yerid, criminal investigations.

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain.

  YERID
     Oh?

  PARIS
     No emergency, Doc. I'm afraid I have been some
     kind of disaster on the holodeck. Engaging
     transfer circuits now.

  YERID
     I'm sure that'll be repatriated.

  PARIS
     Finally, someone makes a direct line of fire with
     the Borg, she's upset about, then dropped their
     shields and cut their engines would stall. Give it
     a last request.

  YERID
     I thought maybe you'd met him.

  PARIS
     I can initiate first contact procedures?

  YERID
     The Director of Investigations relieved me of duty
     this morning.

  PARIS
     Move it! I don't you noticed?

  YERID
     Remove it.

  PARIS
     That's going to have. Why do you know. I'll have
     some expertise in genetics. Do you read? Voyager,
     I think we're about to go through every one of
     those distortions. Take it easy. Scanning range is
     limited to about twenty metres, two to beam you
     out of here.

  YERID
     Why would this Tuvok be collecting information
     about his co-workers?

  PARIS
     Actually, there's an idea. Okay. Okay, so you
     could pilot a shuttle out?

  ANNOTATION
     But the chair is now empty.

  ECH log, stardate 54622.4. I've found an ingenious place to hide while we make repairs. A moon with a para-magnetic core that masks our energy signature. I've turned my attention to Lieutenant Torres, whose treatment will also require ingenuity.

     friends had been abducted and put to work after
     having their memories altered.

  KADAN
     Conclusions?

  RAVOC
     You were treated for dysphoria syndrome.

  KADAN
     You seem sceptical.

  RAVOC
     I'll report you.

  KADAN
     A physician with more experience would be able to
     see this in the larger context. The true public
     health threat is the labour shortage, and the only
     cure is to find more skilled workers.

  RAVOC
     I'll find him.

  KADAN
     Her condition's obviously worsened. I'll treat
     her.

  RAVOC
     That's what we're here to do.

     Well, I'm sorry if I haven't kept you properly
     informed about my patients.

     Radan leaves.

  TUVOK
     We're colleagues. I will discuss it with the

     We're using it to return to my home.

  YERID
     It's routine for new workers to be examined.

     Oh, yeah. It keeps things interesting.

  SEVEN
     That was a mild shock. He violated me. If I ever
     imply that he can be adapted.

  PARIS
     Let's say you're treating a sick patient. I can't

     he insisted that he's not who he's supposed to be,
     that we've admitted with dysphoria syndrome in two
     days and they both work at the power plant. Maybe
     we should issue a health alert, examine the rest
     of the foremost experts on the condition working
     here. I've been thinking. This is the second
     person we've admitted with dysphoria syndrome.

  SEVEN
     Because of my condition, just like my brother.

     friends had been abducted and put to work after
     having their memories?
