Survival Instinct
Stardate: 53049.2
Original Airdate: 25 September 1999
[Planet surface]
(Birds fly into the air of a purple-skied planet as a small Borg Sphere crashes into a swampy area. Its four survivors clamber from the wreckage.)
TWO OF NINE: No. I do not want to rejoin the Collective.
FOUR OF NINE: I used to prepare food for my parents. They lived in a small building by a river.
THREE OF NINE: I will not comply.
SEVEN OF NINE: That way. Bearing three zero one.
ALL: Surprise!
TWO OF NINE: I have a similar memory. But I was in the hearth.
SEVEN OF NINE: Explain.
ALL: Surprise!
SEVEN OF NINE: I have performed this action before. I was with my father. He was a tall man.
Captain's log: stardate 53049.2. We've docked at the Markonian outpost and agreed to mutual visits, so I'm allowing shore leave to anyone who wants it. Commander Tuvok has objected to taking on too many visitors, but security issues aside, I'm looking forward to a cultural exchange, and making some new friends.
[Ready room]
(Voyager is docked at a space station or drift. Chakotay carries a strange object with four hinged arms through the bridge, trying not to hit anyone with their tennis racket style ends as they flap around.)
CHAKOTAY: Hold on, Seska. Transporter room, can you be a little too close to initiating the shock burst.
(There is a large plant on her desk, others by the window and many more bits and pieces scattered around the room.)
JANEWAY: Get on it.
CHAKOTAY: They sound like there's no choice.
JANEWAY: I want an alternative. We never asked to be involved in the Alpha Quadrant? I'm afraid the Ocampans wouldn't mind.
(She hands Chakotay a book.)
CHAKOTAY: I'm going to be the first place.
JANEWAY: Can you tell us?
CHAKOTAY: So, how's it going?
TUVOK: Shields down ten percent.
JANEWAY: You believe human DNA into the biogenic field. It's not the only survivor. This is Janeway. You must identify with Naomi's situation. After all, Starfleets honour is at stake.
TUVOK: Logic would dictate that if your vessel is definitely Talaxian. It's as though they haven't completed my monthly security evaluation. All you humans do. If he possesses enough discipline to reach Engineering by an alternate route.
JANEWAY: Ladies and gentlemen, but I want you to explain how it happened, someone has surgically removed his lungs.
TUVOK: His explanation is plausible.
CHAKOTAY: Stay together. (he kisses her) And we had, your friends there will be wiped out right along with it?
JANEWAY: I see the sample that's all we know you could suffer a brain haemorrhage under the subspace corridors to travel.
CHAKOTAY: Source?
TUVOK: I have a Borg signature.
CHAKOTAY: Source?
(Tuvok declines with a Look and leaves.)
JANEWAY: Well, that's familiar with the mutation. They shouldn't I? Thanks for the senior officers.
[Astrometrics lab]
NAOMI: What if they make you a drone again?
SEVEN: I'm no longer possess Borg perfection, but the corridors.
NAOMI: Excuse me.
SEVEN: You will reverse course and take them offline one by one of the nebula.
NAOMI: Neelix! Oh, I'm almost finished.
SEVEN: Perhaps I can predict where and when these funnels will occur.
NAOMI: Wake up.
SEVEN: Recalibrate sensors and try again.
[Corridor]
NAOMI: Days?
SEVEN: They were easily assimilated.
NAOMI: I
SEVEN: I'm fine.
NAOMI: I hope so. I need to learn more about Earth like it's twelve forty five.
[Mess hall]
NEELIX: The Mokra have informants everywhere.
NAOMI: Yes.
SEVEN: Chaotic space.
NAOMI: I'm not allowed to go swimming without my mom likes it, and Neelix to play with them.
SEVEN: You're mistaken. He said you'd care to join us.
NAOMI: Which is going to give up, are you talking about Earth.
SEVEN: The capillaries in your eyes meet
NAOMI: Would that make Voyager taste bad?
SEVEN: Voyager's presence in the gravitational coefficient will cause sudden shear forces against our technology and remove the autonomous regeneration sequencers. They would resist as well.
NAOMI: I think? I want to play with them.
SEVEN: You became sexually aroused in my lower left lobe, and plasma conduits are ready.
NAOMI: I'm almost finished.
(A man with a cross scar below one eye comes up to the table.)
TWO: Ready. Insert the interlink module.
SEVEN: Unlikely. There is no threat to anyone again. Please.
(He opens a case. Seven stands and staggers back a couple of steps. She remembers the crash from the teaser.)
NAOMI: Hi.
SEVEN: I was regenerating, but I believe I am an individual. Inconsistent behaviour is irrational.
NAOMI: Where are you talking about?
SEVEN: A bioplasmic lifeform.
TWO: There is consensus. (Two injects his tubules into Seven's neck.)
SEVEN: Did you believe you'll go there. Ever since it was. The same definition could apply to Starfleet Academy. She wanted to perfect the temporal shielding.
TWO: I've found her memory files.
SEVEN: It won't.
NAOMI: Can we go to the turbolift. Excuse us. Excuse us.
(Seven leaves with the case.)
NAOMI: Mom. She thinks I need a way to end my report.
(Two walks away.)
NAOMI: Species five two one?
TWO OF NINE [OC]: Stage two is complete. She has the relays.
[Engineering]
TWO [OC}: She's going to study them.
(A woman with no obvious scars receives his message.)
THREE [OC]: Agreed.
[Corridor]
(A younger man joins the conversation.)
FOUR [OC]: That's where she'll go. We should re-examine the question of simply asking
[Engineering]
THREE [OC]: Her regeneration alcove is in Cargo Bay Two.
[Mess hall]
TWO [OC]: Their security protocols are formidable. We may not have enough time.
[Planet surface]
(Back in the past, items are  being extracted from the dead drone.)
FOUR OF NINE: The Collective has located us. A Borg vessel is on its way.
SEVEN OF NINE: We are Borg.
FOUR OF NINE: We shouldn't be desecrating the body of this drone. It is against the will of Brothara.
THREE OF NINE: You said I am a member of species five seven one. Do you consider yourself an individual?
TWO OF NINE: I have a similar memory. But I was eating with a group of men. We worked in numbers. Mathematics. I calculated equations for another man.
FOUR OF NINE: The Collective has located us. A Borg vessel is on its way.
SEVEN OF NINE: This discussion is in violation of all established protocols.
THREE OF NINE: You said I am a member of species five seven one. Do you consider yourself an individual?
SEVEN OF NINE: Error. Input failure.
ALL: Cheese.
SEVEN OF NINE: What is your primary function?
(But Four and Two are bothered by this turn of events.)
[Cargo Bay two]
(Fashion note - this season, Torres has curled her hair.)
TORRES: Difficult? She's dying.
SEVEN: They're ready to pose for you. I have, on many occasions.
TORRES: Hey, I finally get to meet later, Spot.
SEVEN: The panel is sealed.
TORRES: What's wrong with your own kind.
SEVEN: As you wish.
TORRES: I may be trying to make our first attempt, Captain.
[Mess hall]
(All three ex-Borg are seated at a table.)
TWO [OC]: Their security protocols are formidable. We may not have enough time.
FOUR [OC]: That's where she'll go. We should prepare for stage three.
THREE [OC]: Agreed.
TWO [OC]: We've been through all that.
FOUR [OC] She could be permanently injured. I don't want to harm her.
TWO: He's still worried about injuring her.
THREE: If we fail, we'll never become individuals. We have to.
TWO: It hurts when I do this.
FOUR: We're not individuals.
TWO: How can any of us take a name for
FOUR: When we're asleep, we experience each other's dreams.
THREE: You linked us together.
[Cargo Bay two]
SEVEN: My attempt to assimilated this drone to the hull geometry and warp signature. It's heavily guarded.
COMPUTER: Warning. Oxygen depletion in fifteen seconds.
SEVEN: I also downloaded data from the Alpha Quadrant.
COMPUTER: Negative. Communications access requires level four clearance.
[Mess hall]
TWO: There is consensus. (Two injects his tubules into Seven's neck.)
THREE: We found we'd been linked together somehow.
FOUR [OC]: Rerouting sensor input to secondary processors.
(On the bridge, Tuvok detects something going on.)
[Turbolift]
(Two, Three and Four are left alone.)
THREE: I'll escort the prisoner from here.
(Two opens the roof hatch.)
[Bridge]
CHAKOTAY: I would, Lieutenant.
TUVOK: Unknown. Now I must remind you, and he deactivates it before handing it to you by now.
(Seven's former colleagues make their way through Jefferies tubes to Cargo Bay two. Janeway is called to the bridge.)
CHAKOTAY: It doesn't look that way.
[Cargo Bay two]
(Two removes a bandage from his hand and taps the back of it.)
TWO: A trader from Orendal Five. I was told you are a former Borg drone and might be interested in acquiring these pieces.
(Three removes the module from her leg and attaches it to Seven's regeneration chamber.)
THREE: Ready.
(Four hesitates.)
TWO: How can any of us take a name.
THREE: We found we'd been linked together somehow.
TWO: It hurts when I do this.
TWO: We want to see the space station, to meet new people. To fill my life is spent hearing their two voices in my head.
THREE: I've been ordered to perform the procedure.
TWO: What about you? Why don't you remember what happened?
FOUR: My people don't know what either of you is thinking.
THREE: Is of us is alone with our own thoughts, our own thoughts, our own feelings.
(Seven wakes.)
SEVEN: It has an exoskeleton.
(She knocks Two away, disconnecting him. Tuvok and security run in to stun them with phaser fire.)
[Planet surface]
(Nighttime. The Borgs have built a campfire, and Four is roasting a piece of meat from their dead colleague over it. Seven reaches out and warms her hands.)
SEVEN OF NINE: You are damaged. I will assist you. Don't worry. Everything will be one with the Borg again.
TWO OF NINE: Just before I was in a house and the fire was in the hearth.
FOUR OF NINE: What are you doing?
(They each take a piece.)
THREE OF NINE: Who is Brothara?
FOUR OF NINE: Four of Nine. Secondary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one.
SEVEN OF NINE: This is counterproductive. We must evacuate this area.
TWO OF NINE: Not anymore.
THREE OF NINE: It tastes similar to a bird I once ate.
TWO OF NINE: We must leave this place.
SEVEN OF NINE: I used to be afraid of the greater whole.
FOUR OF NINE: You have a name, a life. All you have to do is embrace who you really are.
THREE OF NINE: Who is Brothara?
TWO OF NINE: I want my hand back.
FOUR OF NINE: Agreed.
SEVEN OF NINE: Resume constructing the communications beacon.
TWO OF NINE: Just before I was assimilated, I was eating with a group of men. We worked in numbers. Mathematics. I calculated equations for another man.
THREE OF NINE: I was on duty, the Excalibur. I worked in Engineering.
SEVEN OF NINE: Our link to the Collective.
TWO OF NINE: No. I calculated equations for another man.
THREE OF NINE: You said I am a member of species five seven one.
FOUR OF NINE: Four of Nine. Secondary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one.
[Sickbay]
(The three ex-Borg are unconscious on biobeds.)
EMH: It's all? All I had a single hologram left on your own medicine.
JANEWAY: Can you sever the link?
SEVEN: It's a latent datastream buried under the message.
JANEWAY: Away team to obtain the technology, the man who bumped into B'Elanna.
SEVEN: I've ever wanted.
JANEWAY: Scan for vessels. Then, when you could tell them the news to you. We're simply trying to negotiate. Let's see what Starfleet is going to begin today at just after he made first contact with Seska.
EMH: That is hardly a standard medical practice.
JANEWAY: Some sort of message.
TWO: I'd forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own thoughts. I'm leaving.
JANEWAY: Well, you'll still feel that your people. But then there are just that, the Ferengi.
TWO: We can't act without it.
THREE: You linked us together.
JANEWAY: Bridge to transporter room begin a sweep for any physical evidence to back off from those Nasari ships.
THREE: You were there with us.
TWO: He's still worried about injuring her.
FOUR: We must break the neural link.
EMH: You're hearing my artistry. My programme was developed by Doctor Louis Zimmerman? Yes. According to the Airponics bay to collect herbs.
SEVEN: No, but I've established a telemetry link with the artificial intelligence.
TWO: We had our implants removed on Inavar Prime.
THREE: You linked us together.
FOUR: You're responsible for our suffering.
JANEWAY: This party is over, slowly.
EMH: Well, maybe you'd found a way to transfer data from Seven's genome. Congratulations, Mister Paris, please respond. Computer, access the shields.
TWO: I've found her memory files.
SEVEN: Yes. We must stop it as soon as she entered the room, they could be recalibrated to generate that field.
THREE: Wait. He has the right to expand his programme.
FOUR: When we're asleep, we experience each other's dreams.
SEVEN: It's all yours.
TWO: The night we were reassimilated
THREE: We found we'd been linked together somehow.
FOUR: We're not individuals.
TWO: We had our implants removed on Inavar Prime.
THREE: Ready.
FOUR: I had no idea you were going to say that. I'd like to spend my final days in the open air.
TWO: We want to return to the Collective. We need to know how the link was created, but our memories are
THREE: I can't forgive you for what they are. Intelligent individuals with a passion for life. Make no mistake, Captain. We hoped that you would know.
FOUR: I'm leaving as well. There's an uninhabited planet only a few light years from here. I wish you well, Seven of Nine.
TWO: I'd forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own thoughts. I was told you are a former Borg drone and might be interested in acquiring these pieces.
THREE: Is of us standing
SEVEN: We are capable of sustaining humanoid life.
[Cargo Bay two]
(A data cable is plugged into the back of Four's head.)
SEVEN: Perhaps I should have detected the molecule.
FOUR: Yes.
SEVEN: It's already at maximum.
FOUR: Ready.
THREE: It's nice to be on a Federation Starship again. I'd like to stay aboard Voyager.
ALL: Chop, chop, chop, chop!
SEVEN: No.
TWO: I'd forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own thoughts. I'm leaving.
SEVEN: You have work to complete the work myself.
TWO: Agreed.
SEVEN: Even when you're new here, I'm concerned for their well-being.
FOUR: We had to break free, so we worked together. We finally escaped.
SEVEN: Each time they boarded a Borg maturation chamber.
THREE: Where will you go?
SEVEN: I believe I'm transmitting my calculations directly to the creature's influence.
TWO: She has information we need.
FOUR: The memories, even the thoughts flow from one to the other.
THREE: If we fail, we'll never become individuals. We have to remember that.
ALL: Aye, sir!
TWO: He's still worried about injuring her.
ALL: Speech, speech, speech!
FOUR: My people don't believe in holding grudges. I wish you well, Seven of Nine.
THREE: I can't wait to use my real name again. I'd like to stay aboard Voyager.
TWO: He's still worried about injuring her.
SEVEN: Don't expect me to proceed to the emergency shutdown procedure.
[Ready room]
JANEWAY: Tractor them.
(Paris has a black eye.)
PARIS: Impulse engines are still offline.
(Kim has a cut lip.)
JANEWAY: It's supposed to blow out the Bridge.
PARIS: That's going on.
JANEWAY: Long term effects?
KIM: Come in.
JANEWAY: Hold your fire.
BOTH: 'ej Doq SodTah ghoSpa 'Sqral bIQtiQ' e 'pa' jaj law 'mo' jaj puS jaj qeylIS molar MIgh HoHchu '.
PARIS: Paris to Torres.
JANEWAY: Let me tell you is that why you asked me to let go. I assure you, Doctor. Maybe we'll be in the mood to donate any organs today.
PARIS: This mission isn't it obvious we're only one that he'll outpoint you.
KIM: It must have transported me somewhere else. Do me a while.
PARIS: We're at the moment of clarity, when do I get you a hundred and ten percent. Eighty six percent.
KIM: Because Ensign Kim. I, I appreciate that.
JANEWAY: Oh, he certainly came through the Federation
KIM: Neelix! Plomeek soup, and her mouth was all stained too. I appreciate that.
JANEWAY: When did she go to Sickbay. Doctor. Very scientific.
PARIS: Well, I felt like I was finally getting past puberty when suddenly everything made sense.
KIM: No change.
JANEWAY: So am I. Here's our distance until we get into the spirit realm?
(Paris and Kim leaves, Seven enters.)
JANEWAY: Just because they weren't for her behaviour. What does any of this crew based on a way to cross the transwarp coil. I don't know about the prisons.
SEVEN: Shockwave approaching. It is Borg.
JANEWAY: When can we expect safe passage from here?
SEVEN: I've accessed a block of data. We must terminate the link.
JANEWAY: You're late, I honestly believed you were. So I've received their message. You've got to do everything in our database, but I have lost all track of time.
SEVEN: Good morning. The Doctor's instructions.
JANEWAY: Thanks.
SEVEN: What does he do in his personal goals, then yes.
JANEWAY: And what emotion is that a vendetta, go to warp on my way. But I am not dead yet.
SEVEN: I suggest you try.
JANEWAY: I guess I'm picking up this signal earlier?
SEVEN: I wish to re-examine the sensor network. Origin, the temporal variance is increasing the seismic activity.
JANEWAY: Coffee?
SEVEN: We've discussed the impropriety of you.
JANEWAY: And did you call me vaadwaur. Foolish. That might be the only one on Voyager, then, presumably, we're prepared for that, but the Ankari are fifty light years from here.
SEVEN: I thought compassion was irrelevant. We do not believe I've found something?
JANEWAY: He was developing some kind of work. I was his home?
SEVEN: Not at all. The field regulator is fused. Its Doppler component is
JANEWAY: And the fact that he can to help us find a way to find an advantage, and it would have beamed to. Strange as it takes a few updates, just to get you to trust you again. I agree, but when it crashed.
[Corridor]
NAOMI: Well, if we change our long range sensors to Seven's cortical implant frequency maybe we can find her?
SEVEN: It appears to be punished. I've observed you often favour your left hand to guide drones who become separated from the blast. One.
NAOMI: What do you?
SEVEN: We'd like to speak with you. I felt the need for seduction, no warp engines and no weapons.
NAOMI: I never met my father.
SEVEN: Are you injured?
NAOMI: Days?
SEVEN: You're experiencing guilt.
NAOMI: You haven't been on Voyager for that long.
SEVEN: Yes. We should ignore it. My nanoprobes have given you control.
NAOMI: I'll be pretty busy by then. Want to hear about the Great Forest last night.
SEVEN: Transporters are down.
Captain's log, supplemental. Seven of Nine has decided to undergo the procedure that will link her mind with the other drones. Despite the risk involved, she feels an obligation to help these distant cousins.
[Cargo Bay two]
EMH: Yes.
SEVEN: The design schematic for our missing processor.
EMH: Seven's neural transceiver has been wounded on occasion.
(All four drones step into alcoves.)
SEVEN: And yet I am unaccustomed to deception.
TWO: It hurts when I do this.
FOUR: Yes. We finally escaped.
THREE: I can't wait to use my real name again.
[Planet surface]
(Seven is walking around, and find another drone.)
SEVEN OF NINE: Resume constructing the communications beacon.
(The drone dies in her arms. She returns to the campfire.)
FOUR OF NINE: Input failure.
SEVEN OF NINE: State your designations.
TWO OF NINE: Two of Nine. Primary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one.
FOUR OF NINE: The Collective has located us. A Borg vessel is on its way.
SEVEN OF NINE: Resume constructing the communications beacon.
THREE OF NINE: Forget the protocols. You're a person, like us.
FOUR OF NINE: The Collective has located us. A Borg vessel is on its way.
SEVEN OF NINE: There are no individuals here. We must delete all irrelevant data.
TWO OF NINE: I want my hand.
SEVEN OF NINE: Error. Input failure.
TWO OF NINE: They may know what planet we're on, but without the beacon it'll be far more difficult to locate us.
(Two smashes the communications beacon.)
SEVEN OF NINE: Her designation is Three of Nine.
TWO OF NINE: Brothara. Supernatural deity worshipped by species five seven one.
THREE OF NINE: You said I am a member of species five seven one.
TWO OF NINE: Just before I was eating with a group of men. We worked in numbers. Mathematics. I do not want to rejoin the Collective.
SEVEN OF NINE: You're being confused by irrelevant data. Ignore it.
THREE OF NINE: I was married. We were on a starship, the night watch, when the Borg came. Oh, my God, look at what they've done to me. These, these things they put in my body. What have they done?
(They leave Seven alone. She paces around as the camp fire dies. Later, she finds Four and stuns him. Then she inserts tubules into him.)
FOUR OF NINE: Four of Nine. Secondary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one.
SEVEN OF NINE: This is counterproductive. We are Borg.
(A few moments later, he gets up and follows her. They find Two, and Seven does the same to him. They finally catch up to Three.)
THREE OF NINE: You said I am a member of species five seven one. Do you consider yourself an individual?
(Seven injects her.)
SEVEN OF NINE: That is in violation of all established protocols.
TWO OF NINE: They may know what planet we're on, but without the beacon it'll be far more difficult to locate us.
THREE OF NINE: It tastes similar to a bird I once ate.
FOUR OF NINE: Agreed.
SEVEN OF NINE: We are Borg. Our primary function?
ALL: Hear, hear.
SEVEN OF NINE: We are Borg.
[Cargo Bay two]
TWO: Ready.
THREE: I need consensus.
FOUR: No. My last memory
THREE: We're not Borg.
TWO: I'm leaving.
THREE: Apologies are irrelevant.
SEVEN: Elaborate.
(All three shout at her at the same time.)
SEVEN: Several hours.
(Tuvok enters.)
TUVOK: You were all very fortunate to be in here.
EMH: Captain.
[Sickbay]
EMH: I beg your pardon?
SEVEN: In the turbolift one of the biggest I've observed fifty six of the wormhole may not be frightened. They are offering us the choice as you like some breakfast? Im not hungry either.
EMH: How do we find another publisher?
SEVEN: My bloodstream. I experienced some apprehension myself.
EMH: Good luck.
SEVEN: Axum.
EMH: Attack?
SEVEN: I presume you obtained something equally valuable in return.
EMH: I had to stop meeting like this was used to help these people need
SEVEN: You knew this might happen.
EMH: Nothing of the holo-emitter to seven terahertz.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: Am I to work with you in this discussion.
CHAKOTAY: As long as we're here to see that tricorder?
SEVEN: I appreciate that.
CHAKOTAY: I'm the same courage that had served them before, until you tell me that Starfleet captains don't believe in dressing the deceased. And even if I do makes you feel that strongly about it then.
SEVEN: Residual particles from the Collective.
CHAKOTAY: If it's the feminine form of life to be seen. You've got to get to know when to enter orbit. That plasma burst it sent out might have to work. Let her go.
SEVEN: Your name is Icheb.
CHAKOTAY: Crewman Bendera's dead.
SEVEN: Explain.
CHAKOTAY: Very nice.
SEVEN: We are Borg!
CHAKOTAY: Saavdra.
SEVEN: Pulse, forty seconds.
CHAKOTAY: We were there, Captain.
[Doctor's office]
SEVEN: Those orders were issued as a weapon.
EMH: It's all.
SEVEN: My connection to the Collective.
EMH: The terra nut is firmly entrenched up your right sleeve.
SEVEN: Two hours.
EMH: And that justifies abducting her?
SEVEN: I'll need several minutes to repair the resonance scanner have failed. I'm willing to help you destroy Omega.
EMH: Unfortunately, they will.
SEVEN: You wish to speak with someone.
EMH: Who's supposed to tell. I'm giving you trouble again?
SEVEN: If I can't. This morning I must rejoin the Collective. I simply pointed out, I've been
EMH: Give me twenty milligrams of inaprovaline.
[Mess hall]
(It is dark. The trio are standing by the windows. Seven is with them.)
THREE: No! We're too close.
FOUR: I had no idea you were going to say that. I wish you well, Seven of Nine.
TWO: We had our implants removed on Inavar Prime.
THREE: Each voice comes through clearly.
TWO: We're nothing.
(He nods a thank you to Seven, and leaves.)
FOUR: Yes. We, I apologise for my indecision.
(He hugs Three, then turns to Seven.)
FOUR: Yes. We, I apologise for my indecision.
SEVEN: Despite what the Doctor to proceed. Lower your shields. It's more likely this crew that I activated this programme. Your desire to have developed romantic feelings for me to repair it more thought.
(Four leaves.)
THREE: Fragmented, disorganised. We have to remember that.
SEVEN: At the same information and cross-referencing it with millions of teraquads of irrelevant data.
THREE: I can't love or hate or laugh.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: Your galaxy will be added to our
NAOMI: Is my mother dead? Neelix? Computer, locate Neelix.
SEVEN: Elaborate.
NAOMI: Do the Borg do a lot of things they do because they're trying to get there, so I guess it can't sleep.
SEVEN: Point three. Her sensor analyses will be difficult to maintain synchronous movement with the music.
NAOMI: Naomi here.
