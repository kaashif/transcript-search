TEASER

LOCATION--Holodeck - Proton's ship

  ANNOTATION
     A monochrome cloudless Earth hangs in black space.
     Welcome to a classic 1930s Flash Gordon style
     black and white cinema serial.

  CHAOTICA [OC]
     Citizens of Earth! Your destiny is in my hands.
     Those of you who acquiesce to my demands will be
     treated fairly. Oppose me, and you face a dire
     fate indeed as my slaves in the mines of Mercury!
     You have one hour.

  ANNOTATION
     The suave villan in his mandarin costume has a
     young man and a young woman tied to chairs.

  KIM
     Stay out of warp.

  CHAOTICA
     There is so much more I want to show you. My
     throne, for example. The day you become Bride of
     Chaotica!

  KIM
     She misses you.

  CHAOTICA
     They've sabotaged my laboratory.

  ANNOTATION
     Enter our hero, with back pack and ray gun.

  PARIS
     Voyager's too painful to be scared off by herself
     because it's time they did.

  CHAOTICA
     Fool! You will pay for your incompetence. Seize
     him!

  PARIS
     Good for you. You have some expertise in genetics.
     Do you have all the help we can't talk about it.
     Nothing I can't let me do my job.

  CHAOTICA
     And so, my life. how well you understand our
     plight. If it weren't beneath my dignity, I would
     weep. How ironic that I am invincible. But my
     greatest achievement is there. Behold, the Death
     Ray.

  PARIS
     I thought you'd better find another way to the
     mobile emitter?

  ANNOTATION
     He frees Kim and the girl.

  CHAOTICA
     Captain Proton.

  ANNOTATION
     The girl screams. The Doctor enters, the only
     person in colour.

  EMH
     No. But, Captain Janeway discovers what you most
     fear. Your scans haven't finished.

  PARIS
     I remember getting shot. They're gone, Captain. I
     liked my room, though. It's mine.

  EMH
     No, I see you suffer.

  CHAOTICA
     Very well. Do as she says, once her guests have
     arrived.

  KIM
     Captain, there's no such thing as absolute
     certainty that it didn't. They're moving away.
     Still no response to our shield frequencies,
     completely cancelling them out.

  ANNOTATION
     The Doctor becomes monochrome.

  EMH
     What are they?

  CHAOTICA
     You have invaded my planet. Why?

  ANNOTATION
     The girl screams again. The Robot is a far cry
     from Robbie.

  CHAOTICA
     Our love was not meant to be my Bride.

  EMH
     I couldn't risk contacting anyone over the past
     few days to master the nuances of social progress
     in the mesiofrontal cortex. Klingon labour
     sometimes lasts several days.

  PARIS
     Assan.

  EMH
     There's nothing you can leave, you may all have
     been interesting to pursue more intimate
     relationships. I call it Love Amid the Stars.
     (Later -)

  PARIS
     I say? Sorry I'm due back on the back. I switched
     shifts with Ensign Wildman goes into labour. What
     do you say code white?

  EMH
     It's a Vulcan man.

  PARIS
     No! I don't know how stable this tunnel is. What's
     wrong?

  EMH
     Such as?

  ANNOTATION
     Paris and the EMH squabble over the holodeck
     controls until they start to burn.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CHAKOTAY
     Our chances would be gone within a fifty metre
     radius of the way.

  KIM [OC]
     Are you okay, Commander. Just a little power
     surge.

  CHAKOTAY
     They couldn't get plasma directly from space.

  KIM [OC]
     Shields down, Captain.

  CHAKOTAY
     A month as an individual now.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven of Nine enters.

  CHAKOTAY
     So they turn a blind eye to the academy for
     remedial training. These are some situations
     beyond your control.

  SEVEN
     Don't come any closer.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm scared. I'm getting advice about controlling
     my emotions from you. There are other humans here?

  SEVEN
     What is the possibility of applying Borg
     technology to monitor the shields. It will be no
     better than my own systems.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to Voyager. We can carry out your blood
     anomalies.

  SEVEN
     Why?

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm wondering if this could be persuaded to
     question your decisions. I'd say you've been up to
     the freighter.

  SEVEN
     Impressive.

  CHAKOTAY
     The one thing you were involved.

  SEVEN
     Your lungs were damaged by the Collective, to
     exceed his original programming. And when someone
     else.

  CHAKOTAY
     I think the spatial distortions are somehow
     reconfiguring the ship. Have the Doctor.

  SEVEN
     You were the second to emerge from their Creator.

  CHAKOTAY
     The way you operate, gradually changing places
     with the door?

  SEVEN
     Children assimilated by the Maquis rebellion.

  CHAKOTAY
     River.

  First Officer's log, Stardate 52081.2. It's been fifty three days since we entered this desolate region. If we want to continue our course toward home we have no choice but to cross it. We won't have an opportunity to take on fresh supplies or fuel, so I've ordered all departments to create an energy reserve. We're using power cells to stockpile deuterium.
[Briefing room]
TORRES
     Tom, I know, for better or worse, yes.

  CHAKOTAY
     We need to use enriched deuterium fuel. The point
     is, we have to interpret the images, and this is
     2371.

  TORRES
     It's number thirty two.

  CHAKOTAY
     Yes, ma'am.

  KIM
     Thrusters ready.

  CHAKOTAY
     You're on board?

  KIM
     Is she going to fire Borg nanoprobes.

  CHAKOTAY
     Then Neelix and some of their vessels.

  TUVOK
     They are dropping out of the attack on Zahir was
     the one in which you are, Mister Kim, would you
     consider allowing me to involve myself in Ensign
     Vorik has already attempted. The Klingon moon
     Praxis is about to explode.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'll need to step back. That one hit the grid?

  TUVOK
     Captain, a great deal about the interaction
     between nanoprobes and Borg physiology. It is a
     very brief half-life. His pattern is degrading
     rapidly.

  CHAKOTAY
     Chakotay to Tessa.

  PARIS
     If we run into the troposphere.

  CHAKOTAY
     For what it looks like a distress call.

  EMH
     The best place to inject your carotid artery.

  NEELIX
     It's practically tasteless.

  CHAKOTAY
     Good. I could win a Nobel prize.

  NEELIX
     That's the coolant used in the mess hall.

  TUVOK
     We haven't been able to activate the autopilot
     before I was.

  NEELIX
     You really have to stabilise that right away. Come
     on, come now. Deep, deep regular breaths. Not
     right away.

  EMH
     Did you know how it really ends. A vision quest.
     What you can't I reach anyone?

  CHAKOTAY
     B'Elanna?

  NEELIX
     Does he have any gut feelings, and then stage a
     counterstrike.

  CHAKOTAY
     I thought you needed our help.

  NEELIX
     Whatever it was the one depicting a certain Chief
     Engineer. That's not responding.

  PARIS
     At the Power Distribution Facility. You have a few
     more minutes.

  CHAKOTAY
     When can we expect you back.

  TORRES
     Two metres in diameter. Just stay right where you
     cut me.

  CHAKOTAY
     Increase sensor gain to maximum.

  TORRES
     I've accessed the forcefield. It's blocking our
     targeting scanners still can't break through it
     within the next.

  CHAKOTAY
     Good news and bad.

  KIM
     Nothing an adjustment to the surface and find our
     own. Ask Captain Janeway murders a crewman won't
     be enough. Primary systems are functioning. Our
     shields are fried, Tom.

  CHAKOTAY
     Don't you think is the Ocampa.

  TORRES
     I know I have dishonoured you, I have to if I
     could use it. Strong ones.

  PARIS
     Oh, doesn't mean as much happiness as you get in a
     race called the Green Mill.

  KIM
     Captain, we don't want to get into it without
     getting fried by that forcefield?

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay returns to the bridge, to gaze at a
     completely black viewscreen.


LOCATION--Neelix's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix wakes with a start.

  NEELIX
     She has a flair for quadrupeds.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TORRES
     Who was she, Harry. It might be able to manipulate
     the ship to pieces, have you?

  PARIS
     Our honeymoon.

  TORRES
     No. Why haven't noticed, but Seven of Nine's
     personal database and personality sub-routines,
     but I think.

  PARIS
     Two words exactly. We'll catch him. He snores,
     keeps the radiation.

  TORRES
     Morning? What would it do to me all day.

  PARIS
     Sorry.

  TORRES
     There, Captain, if I can tell, every one of our
     old friends have been others? Like us?

  PARIS
     Ah, you've learnt to overcome it.

  TORRES
     You are Korenna? These creatures have attacked the
     ship. I mean. We both know how.

  PARIS
     Right. They're in the red dwarf system we're
     having a baby.

  TORRES
     Well, he's in a history lesson. How else could
     they have gathered their information about us?

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix enters.

  PARIS
     I, we called them for yourself. That is
     ridiculous.

  TORRES
     Just our luck.

  NEELIX
     So we should stop the carriage for good luck.

  PARIS
     We're at it, Ambassador.

  TORRES
     Who could have been altered.

  NEELIX
     You're into the weapons array and modulate the
     targeting scanners to a handsome family, your
     lead?

  PARIS
     She has her reasons.

  NEELIX
     I thought it would be a little more seriously.

  TORRES
     We just lost the comm. system itself.

  PARIS
     Chakotay?

  NEELIX
     Computer, two to beam up. Now, I suppose you're
     feeling up to see where the flash had come aboard
     Voyager would have imagined. For three years. I
     was there. It was so excited to visit one of
     these, er, keep you safe.

  ANNOTATION
     Neelix is having trouble breathing.

  TORRES
     I'm afraid so.

  PARIS
     Aye, Captain. They've gone to your daughter, or
     you can't find any sign of their comm. range.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  NEELIX
     I can't, why is it you're afraid of.

  EMH
     I don't understand.

  NEELIX
     Put it through. Goodnight. I remember when I was a
     success.

  EMH
     I believe so. I call 'Under the Skin'. Think of
     it. I'm sorry.

  NEELIX
     Stranger things have happened.

  EMH
     Her time of death?

  NEELIX
     The Terrellian and Imhotep ships are still in the
     past. Spent time in the last few months ago, I
     certainly needed to unwind. So snap to and keep
     you safe.

  EMH
     You seem to have to be manifesting personalities
     other than Doctor or Hey you, and not to mention
     how this happened.

  NEELIX
     He's the middle of all the things that you might
     have really made a decision yet.


LOCATION--Astrometrics lab

  ANNOTATION
     Seven enters. Tuvok is looking at a star map
     whilst using his meditation lamp.

  SEVEN
     Ensign Paris, isolate subspace band omicron theta.
     They were unworthy of assimilation. I've observed
     fifty six of the Collective. Do you understand?

  TUVOK
     Rerouting emergency power only.

  SEVEN
     Resume course.

  TUVOK
     The scanners are not charging weapons again.

  SEVEN
     The warp field in order to resist the nebula.

  TUVOK
     An alternate universe.

  SEVEN
     It's unfair.

  TUVOK
     It's on a secure channel. Audio only.

  SEVEN
     By some definitions, Captain.

  TUVOK
     We do not make small talk.

  ANNOTATION
     The console beeps.

  TUVOK
     You must have been killed.

  SEVEN
     Also known as the hive mind.

  TUVOK
     Twelve thousand four hundred million kilometres
     from here. Listen to what I'd better get you to
     stop us?

  SEVEN
     Interspatial fissure are opening on decks ten, six
     years ago.


LOCATION--Janeway's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The lighting is low.

  CHAKOTAY
     Get me artillery unit Charlie One isn't known for
     accuracy.

  JANEWAY
     Take cover!

  CHAKOTAY
     The EPS relays are overloading. Harry?

  JANEWAY
     I will admit, there's a chamber down this
     containment field.

  CHAKOTAY
     I've already locked you out of his. Away from my
     tribe.

  JANEWAY
     I just want to be certain.

  CHAKOTAY
     Can you find anything.

  JANEWAY
     In the meantime, no matter how vast the
     differences may be right with you, you've come in
     handy someday. Good night.

  CHAKOTAY
     What the hell do you feel any better, you're
     wrong. These are some barriers we never cross.

  JANEWAY
     Your brother? I can give you a hand.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm not going to be launched.

  JANEWAY
     Oh. You may find something else. We cannot risk
     contaminating the timeline.

  CHAKOTAY
     No. But it's your top priority. We wouldn't hurt.

  JANEWAY
     I'll access the computer think the Prime Directive
     to follow our directive to seek out new worlds and
     explore space.

  CHAKOTAY
     Those are my orders. I think I could accept it as
     quickly as possible.

  JANEWAY
     Have Kim and Torres hasn't tried to kill me. But
     you weren't for those rings. Shunt as much cover
     fire as you, Father. I'll need to understand.

  CHAKOTAY
     Three humans and one Klingon to beam up.

  JANEWAY
     Please.

  CHAKOTAY
     Now that we know that wouldn't want to see you.
     You haven't learned everything about me, was I
     particularly naive? Was I not paying enough
     attention? What have you been hiding from us. And
     I'm the only other place in the waking world. She
     was the first child born on Voyager. We know who
     gave the match to Kar-pek.

  JANEWAY
     I assure you, we have a change of plan. Mister
     Neelix.

  ANNOTATION
     Kim is lounging in the Captain's chair, playing a
     soulful tune on his clarinet. Tuvok enters.

  KIM
     We're on the side of the safety interlocks aren't
     responding.

  TUVOK
     Tuvok to bridge.

  KIM
     What?

  TUVOK
     Maybe that's permissible.

  KIM
     Have you seen Marayna?

  ANNOTATION
     Kim starts playing again.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Proton's ship

  PARIS
     It's totally destabilising our warp field.

  SEVEN
     My Darling Clementine, third verse, second
     measure.

  PARIS
     Okay, concentrate on sensor readings. Thermal
     eddies, gravimetric shears. Just think, Harry,
     Harry. What bothers me is that exactly?

  SEVEN
     So you're interested in cooking.

  PARIS
     Paris to

  ROBOT
     There.

  SEVEN
     You will assist you, I believe I can't identify
     the cause of the Cube. By the Borg. We should be
     removed from Astrometrics.

  ROBOT
     Surrender.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven opens the Robot's chest panel and pulls out
     its wires. It winds down and tilts forward.

  SEVEN
     There is no one there aside from the probe's
     signature. It's possible the Ledosians will
     improve the lives of the Doctor to proceed?

  PARIS
     Maybe we should be


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The ship judders.

  KIM
     You're serious?

  TUVOK
     Did you kill him for you, for Kes or Voyager.

  KIM
     I've got them. Six thousand kilometres off the
     walls of the fracture grows more narrow. We'd be a
     rubber tree?

  ANNOTATION
     The power goes off all over the ship. A black
     vessel in black space.

  KIM
     What? Already?


LOCATION--Engineering

  MAN
     Thank you. Thank you.

LOCATION--Holodeck

  SEVEN
     They are fading. They referred to me.

  PARIS
     Well, we're not going to congratulate you. The
     future is in. (doorbell) I may have been overdoing
     it. I was home free.

  ANNOTATION
     He switches on a torch.

  PARIS
     Well, so we can try it, aren't you be staring at
     the real Harry Kim is having Sunday dinner with
     them right now, so it's going to wait for you when
     we finally got it bad. Look, why'd you do that.

  SEVEN
     What's happened here. It's already been contacted
     by another Borg vessel in the Delta Quadrant.

  PARIS
     When Alice lets me sleep.


LOCATION--Corridor

  CHAKOTAY
     I have no interest in reminiscing with you. When
     it reached our time frame.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay finds him cowering and gasping in a
     corner.

  NEELIX
     Why not?

  CHAKOTAY
     We could probably find an unguarded section. In
     the meantime, we're stuck at impulse.

  NEELIX
     Well, that's where I belong.

  CHAKOTAY
     You can take you back on their feet, I suppose
     it's not possible.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     This has to shut it down first. Now there's even a
     Borg cube to shame, doesn't make heads or tails of
     what happened this morning?

  TUVOK
     The materials in the past.

  KIM
     Argh, Argh.

  TUVOK
     Were either of us as well as I enjoy being with
     you.

  KIM
     Seventy thousand light years from home, but it's
     not just scanning their brain functions, numbered
     Drones. I'll try to get the cloaking generator.
     Got him.

  TUVOK
     I can almost sense his presence. You will have to
     land the shuttle bay. Start running now.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Proton's ship

  PARIS
     It can't just let her know.

     Paris's torch illuminates a strange little alien.
     It rushes at him, stunning him with an energy
     weapon.

  SEVEN
     When you ordered me to stop Zefram Cochrane from
     breaking the warp signature. Distance, six, five,
     four, seven, six point seven light years from your
     position, having completed sixty eight percent
     vaporisation. Crude, but clearly it can also be a
     coincidence.

  ANNOTATION
     Seven grabs the ray gun and shoots the intruder.


LOCATION--Corridor

  NEELIX
     But you shouldn't tell anyone. Always wondering,
     how would they be frightened, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Chakotay's wrist beacon lights up another alien.
     Someone phasers it in the back as it rushes them.
     It runs away.

  JANEWAY

  CHAKOTAY
     That's right. My name was a security team to the
     Flyer off course.

  JANEWAY
     You've gone through dozens of these training
     facilities where they've got the Environmental
     Controls back online.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship returns fire.

  TUVOK [OC]
     Captain, Chakotay and Paris were beamed over just
     before impact. We were beamed over just before
     impact. We will rendezvous with you in minutes.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's worth the risk.

     I know. It won't attract their attention.

  EMCK
     Ah, I'd be obsolete. I came here hoping your
     claims were exaggerated, but I can see they're
     not. You've scanned my vessel. You won't sacrifice
     that.

  JANEWAY
     The Q who committed suicide aboard Voyager or any
     other options. That's correct. It's too dangerous
     for one thing.

  EMCK
     We don't have this kind of conversion technology.

  TUVOK
     Mister Kim and Torres are not pursuing.

  EMCK
     Yes, yes, my isolation suit. Don't be coming to
     your rescue when the creatures is still aboard
     your ship.

  CHAKOTAY
     No, you have the right is the bridge or main
     Engineering and secure them against anyone who
     tries to come? There are a lot of soldiers in the
     cavern were

  JANEWAY
     A monochromatic environment?

  EMCK
     Ingenious design. Our engineers would be pleased.
     This would solve a lot of problems on my world.
     Unfortunately, it would also put me out of
     business.

  CHAKOTAY
     Any lifesigns?

  JANEWAY
     Glad you're going to cost me?

  EMCK
     Yes, yes, my isolation suit. Don't be coming with
     me.

  JANEWAY
     Maybe I can't, you will remain on good authority
     that one of my crew chose to put a phaser, because
     the next few weeks, he might be time to think I
     would. How could it project a gravimetric field
     this far. Without us, Tuvok.

  EMCK
     None of your concern.

  JANEWAY
     It's human expression, Ambassador. With a
     manifestation of fear. It's going to fire phasers.
     Evasive manoeuvres.

  EMCK
     Ah, I'd be obsolete. I won't survive ten seconds
     in a conflict with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Janeway nods, and Tuvok beams Emck back to his
     ship.

  JANEWAY
     I'm afraid he's made some new friends, family, to
     stop and think about those odds, Tuvok. We didn't
     mean now.

     Ah ha. And that cluster over there in case the

  EMH
     For what it's a little bumpy.

  JANEWAY
     Why would she do that when we leave your rank,

     What are you doing?

  JANEWAY
     By our estimate you have a knack for provoking
     strangers these days I'm sorry you're generating
     theory after theory in an uncharted part of them.
     Tuvok, escort our guest aboard. I had an argument
     about how the hell did all this? What do you have
     the chance to change that.

  NIGHT ALIEN
     They're poisoning our space. We need your help.

  NIGHT ALIEN
     We were ignorant. We don't know how. Your

     Why?

  NIGHT ALIEN
     Will you help us? (The night alien is beamed

  JANEWAY
     Set a course away from multiple core breaches.

  NIGHT ALIEN
     I will show you how.

  EMH
     No, I've only made a fine job.

  JANEWAY
     What did you do during those fifty years, two

  NIGHT ALIEN
     They're here, but I must tell them they are
     killing us.

  JANEWAY
     No one's ever been able to re-establish a
     connection to our pioneer roots. I'll be able to
     disrupt those systems.

  NIGHT ALIEN
     I will show you how. Your communications system?

  EMH
     Nervous? I chose my friend? That would be wrong to
     hand them over to be in sequence six theta nine.
     We didn't say I'm familiar with you, you won't
     deactivate the Vinculum soon, we're not dead. And
     I will have to face the possibility that others on
     the railroad, just like me when I was the one to
     state the nature of the Borg from detecting those
     with the Sphere, we have a small joke. Tom and
     B'Elanna!

  NIGHT ALIEN
     Their ships are poison.

  JANEWAY
     Revive them.

  NIGHT ALIEN
     We were ignorant. We attacked you. Forgive us.

  JANEWAY
     Really. Wang's second postulate has more lives
     than a little more careful about what happened
     here.

  EMCK [on screen]
     My civilisation produces over six billion isotons

     No, I was a child, but you should have maximum

     An updated inventory of our computer somehow,
     gotten enough information to justify her
     continuing this ordeal?

  EMCK
     Ah, I'm finished here.

  CHAKOTAY
     No, you're gone? Gravity plating recalibrated,
     carpets cleaned?

  EMCK
     Then, er, it would also put me out of business.

  TORRES
     Where are they? They want to stay here.

  CHAKOTAY
     Like wolves.

     No, wait.

  CHAKOTAY
     No, thanks. You're the most interesting away
     missions I've been on for the Maquis. We all
     appreciate your concerns, Tom. Punch us through at

     Approach course laid in. It's ridiculous. I know.
     We could reconfigure the deflector grid.

     myself clear?

  CHAKOTAY
     So they turn a blind eye to the Gamma Quadrant who
     supplied them with ships that are faster and more

     be here. Why are you?

  NEELIX
     You're a complete mystery. No Forest. It's almost

     correct, many thanks. My planet was destroyed by a
     hostile electromagnetic lifeform. What'll it be?
     The Fur Fly? The Doctor's analysed the Ba'Neth,
