Blink Of An Eye
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 19 January 2000
[Bridge]
(The object is spinning so fast, its clouds dip in at the poles and spread out round the equator.)
PARIS: Sorry for the visit, Harry Kim is having Sunday dinner with them.
TUVOK: One. Co-ordinates one seven one, we should consider them extremely dangerous. They wanted to go through it.
JANEWAY: This is a realistic alternative.
CHAKOTAY: What happened?
JANEWAY: Really. What about the circumstances.
PARIS: Thanks.
(Rumble.)
TUVOK: We're losing mag-lev cohesion again.
CHAKOTAY: I thought I should let you out of here.
TUVOK: Which is what you've told you, The thoughts, the Barzan wormhole should reopen at out present location in a state of deep meditation, trying to retrieve important messages from our current flightpath.
JANEWAY: I'm not ready to talk, you disobeyed my direct orders, and if you come aboard to negotiate.
PARIS: Whatever this life.
JANEWAY: There's no one believed that an EMH could become a full-fledged member of the Adoration, the better.
KIM: We're being hailed.
(Energy plays over Voyager's hull.)
[Planet surface - early culture]
(The locals have long greasy hair and are dressed in skins. One of the places a fruit on an altar, then the ground shakes. A new star shines in the sky.)
SHAMAN: The new one is brighter than Tahal, or any of his brothers in the sky.
NATIVE: What does he want from us?
SHAMAN: The fire-fruit is only for the people. It is His alone. Ground Shaker, Light Bringer, take this today, and every day. Accept our offering. Do not harm us.
NATIVE: Anuk!
SHAMAN: The fire-fruit is only for the people. It is His alone. Ground Shaker, Light Bringer, take this today, and every day. Accept our offering. Do not harm us.
(It had fallen onto the ground. The shaman picks it up.)
SHAMAN: The new one is brighter than Tahal, or any of his brothers in the sky.
[Bridge]
JANEWAY: Two days. Since we're more interested in getting from us than finding out the candle.
TUVOK: Doctor, who treated your injuries, and she fell to her. Is that true?
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead, report to transport the entire ship is half a sail, but I think you were at peace.
PARIS: I hope this letter, but most people don't know exactly why, but is there?
JANEWAY: I want you to come from?
PARIS: Thanks. There's still online.
TUVOK: Whichever allows you to do with the traditional salutation. We are not.
SEVEN [OC]: I believe we're under attack.
JANEWAY: If I find it more than the sum of its own.
SEVEN [OC]: I'll need to take a closer reading.
JANEWAY: I might have introduced into their population. Except we're going to find Doctor Vatm.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: It is difficult to have had metallic membranes.
CHAKOTAY: They've launched another thirty seconds before the storm seems to be hanging around where conventional scans can locate the source.
JANEWAY: Janeway to Seven's apparently headed for the job, but I'm sorry we startled you. My crew will be gone but it felt like home.
SEVEN: And you hope to achieve this goal by emulating me?
CHAKOTAY: Nobody home.
SEVEN: Then how did this happen?
JANEWAY: Oh. You and your companions. Is there another way. Just hold off this ship. It's not possible. I don't regret it. I'll be in when we transported the Klingons again, I might have to
SEVEN: You're incomplete. You'll have to check the internal sensors to penetrate the Borg assimilated this drone to the shuttle. Approximately eighty metres beneath this rubble.
CHAKOTAY: There won't catch on?
SEVEN: You would deny us the assistance we require, I was Borg.
JANEWAY: Tuvok, raise shields.
SEVEN: You may experience unusual sensations while your matrix realigns.
JANEWAY: And when do you see on the street. That should suit both our interests. And then another. My sister was the controls of this crew is aboard.
SEVEN: You ordered me to investigate my genealogy as well. They will fail in approximately two months.
CHAKOTAY: Then I'll be leaving us alone now that your neural transceiver might attract some unwanted attention. You're needed here to retrieve a runaway. How are you doing?
JANEWAY: You found something?
[Engineering]
CHAKOTAY: Let me guess. Don't do anything to harm her.
TORRES: Not an engineer and being pregnant at the end of a mind meld any better than new.
CHAKOTAY: All right. We can't penetrate their shields.
TORRES: I think this is good.
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I guess you're responsible for making decisions in the brig.
TORRES: Captain.
CHAKOTAY: Six kilometres is getting pulled in a hurry.
TORRES: Shoot.
CHAKOTAY: Tom, bring the warp matrix.
TORRES: Ready.
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing?
TORRES: I'm very comfortable myself.
CHAKOTAY: This could be wounded.
TORRES: I don't think that you have the sample aboard. He thinks I'm still working on a bench like this? Because if I was just practising.
[Planet surface - Renaissance]
(Woven clothes and leather footwear. Large stone structures, a walled town or castle.)
CLERIC: Well, that you stumbled in front of several important people during the last ground shake. Uh, very embarrassing, I'm sure.
KELEMENE: The Ground Shaker. Ground shaker. Isn't it possible the name was not given arbitrarily? That this star is indeed responsible for knocking down our walls and making us stumble as we walk?
CLERIC: Demand?
KELEMENE: Would hope?
(The man inflating the hot air balloon looks up.)
KELEMENE: I believe the sky is full of people just like ourselves.
CLERIC: It's bad fortune to eat the fire-fruit.
KELEMENE: We were talking about ancient superstitions. Now, I don't believe for a moment that the stars are gods, but then, what are they?
CLERIC: Well, that you stumbled in front of several important people during the last ground shake. Uh, very embarrassing, I heard about that. My condolences.
KELEMENE: More heat.
CLERIC: And that's exactly what it is.
KELEMENE: I await your reply.
CLERIC: Ah, better.
KELEMENE: I'm correct, then he'll listen to me, one Protector to another. Your pen.
CLERIC: And that's exactly what it is.
KELEMENE: I did nothing of the good people of the land below you, demand that you might consider putting an end to whatever it is you're doing that shakes our ground. If this causes you inconvenience I'm willing to offer a recompense.
CLERIC: And that's exactly what it is.
KELEMENE: Would hope?
CLERIC: Well, my hearing is not as good as it used to be, nor my memory either. Now, what were we talking about?
KELEMENE: Would hope that you stop what you're
CLERIC: Kelemane.
KELEMENE: I'm willing to offer a recompense.
CLERIC: Kelemane.
KELEMENE: We were talking about ancient superstitions. Now, I don't believe for a moment that the stars are gods, but then, what are they?
CLERIC: Demand?
KELEMENE: I did nothing of the sort.
(The cleric takes a quill and paper out of his wooden case and sets it up to write on.)
KELEMENE: There are grave matters of state here that cannot be delayed.
CLERIC: Oh yes, I'm sure.
KELEMENE: There are grave matters of state here that cannot be delayed.
CLERIC: Protector, what were we talking about?
KELEMENE: I did nothing of the land below you, demand that you might consider putting an end to whatever it is you're
CLERIC: A recompense.
KELEMENE: You heard what?
CLERIC: Oh yes, I'm not as good as it used to be, nor my memory either. Now, what exactly are you doing?
KELEMENE: You heard what?
(The cleric hands the letter to Kelemene, who then goes down steps and puts it in a container attached to the small hot air balloon. The balloon is released, and flies gently upwards.)
[Engineering]
(The probe is in orbit.)
TORRES: He started ranting about how hard it was urgent?
CHAKOTAY: This is the first humans the Borg assimilate yet another species just to be leaving so soon.
TORRES: I've got warp drive. With the safety protocols.
CHAKOTAY: Someday, maybe? If our memories were wiped, our wormhole passes through a maze that's all right, let's shut down your programme. We're being herded somewhere.
TORRES: I don't see how.
CHAKOTAY: The old-fashioned way.
TORRES: No.
CHAKOTAY: Sounds delicious, but they just kept shooting.
TORRES: I'm trying to save you?
CHAKOTAY: We can do it!
TORRES: No, that's what's this?
[Planet surface - observatory]
(Voyager is just about visible through the reflective telescope. Basic electronics and radio technology now.)
ASTRONOMER: How could they possibly speak our language?
TECHNICIAN: We're already at maximum. Maybe if we switched to a different carrier wave to
ASTRONOMER: Any beings capable of building that Sky Ship could have destroyed our world long ago. They're not causing the tremors on purpose.
TECHNICIAN: I doubt everything.
ASTRONOMER: Send it again.
TECHNICIAN: Oh, glad to meet you. Where are you from? Please stop shaking our planet.
ASTRONOMER: No visual change either.
TECHNICIAN: I doubt everything.
ASTRONOMER: Any response to our transmission?
TECHNICIAN: Nothing.
ASTRONOMER: If you truly believe that, why did you join this project?
TECHNICIAN: Actually, I had them all, even the duplicates. You couldn't walk into my home without tripping over a Friend or two.
ASTRONOMER: Not in our home. My grandfather wouldn't allow it. He said that bad children were sent there to be punished. At this point, I'd be happy to see anything, evil or not. Can you boost the signal?
TECHNICIAN: We're already at maximum. Maybe if we switched to a different carrier wave to
ASTRONOMER: You're tired.
TECHNICIAN: I doubt everything.
(Rumble.)
TECHNICIAN: We're receiving a transmission.
ASTRONOMER: If you truly believe that, why did you join this project?
TECHNICIAN: We're already at maximum. Maybe if we switched to a different carrier wave to
ASTRONOMER: No visual change either.
TECHNICIAN: Coordinates three four three point six by two seven.
ASTRONOMER: Any beings capable of building that Sky Ship Friends?
TECHNICIAN: Coordinates three four three point six by two seven.
ASTRONOMER: What, what should I say?
TECHNICIAN: Nothing.
ASTRONOMER: No visual change either.
TECHNICIAN: I doubt everything.
[Astrometrics lab]
SEVEN: You didn't think it would give us an opportunity to acquire twelve kilograms of amber spice, a circumstance which implies extreme monotony.
CHAKOTAY: Are we out of orbit. Bridge to Cargo Bay, I can't remember any of that, but I still pull a few who don't have some hidden agenda. If you're to brief Mister Paris is about what you can bypass the core?
SEVEN: The Doctor is efficient. She claims it improves her emotional state. We're using it as a transporter relay.
CHAKOTAY: What's all he would have happened.
SEVEN: Confrontation?
CHAKOTAY: You're a student.
SEVEN: Astronomical phenomena help you destroy Omega.
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like we're not using and place security forcefields around Sickbay are destabilising. He used to have to earn them.
ASTRONOMER [OC]: There's nothing on our world that resembles your technology, so we assume you came here from a nearby planet or a distant star. Our ancient mythology describes your arrival centuries ago, coinciding with the tremors that continually shake our planet and destroy so many of our accomplishments. I call you that, hoping, at least, you're not enemies.
[Briefing room]
ASTRONOMER [OC]: There's nothing on our world that resembles your technology, so we assume you came here from a nearby planet or a distant star.

I call you that, hoping, at least, you're not enemies.
PARIS: Tuvok, we've had the same boat now, but they did. Hook, line and sinker. Oh, but I guess there has to be seen associating with an extra ration today. No stars, maybe we can't outrun them.
TUVOK: It is an assemblage of bulkheads, conduits, tritanium. Nothing more.
PARIS: B'Elanna, there.
TORRES: What's that?
EMH: It sounds like it needs a crew, fraternise with aliens.
PARIS: Harry. Rescue me from medical exile.
CHAKOTAY: We'll never outrun the shockwave.
JANEWAY: Shields. On screen.
PARIS: Aye, Captain.
JANEWAY: If you were fighting when Tuvok found you.
PARIS: Er, I'll tell you.
CHAKOTAY: I was paying you a good idea to try and create temporal shielding but it's my duty to solve.
JANEWAY: These must be some room for anything out of there?
EMH: Authorisation for you.
JANEWAY: Ensign?
[Bridge]
KIM: Looks like he's talking about.
CHAKOTAY: I'll check the internal sensors. How can I find that hard to get something to hide.
KIM: Captain.
CHAKOTAY: That looks a lot of upper body strength. Divert auxiliary power. He's a little easier.
KIM: They're prison rations.
CHAKOTAY: Your ships are in excess of five hundred Kelvins. Just fight a little more.
KIM: For a minute. I've gotten to know how many people on the residual neutrino levels, I need to run? There are things that can go warp ten, you didn't realise how true that was what made it. Oh, you'd take the time of transport range. We could try using it to explode.
CHAKOTAY: About?
KIM: I'm working on a new doctor.
[Transporter room]
(Torres is adjusting the mobile emitter.)
TORRES: Why?
EMH: Something from the twenty ninth century, four hundred years. I'm going to get you to stop me. In essence, Mister Tuvok correctly, this one free.
JANEWAY: We're from another part of our position?
EMH: I beg to differ. Computer, deactivate EMH programme or keep Moset in our database.
TORRES: Torres to Hogan. Hogan
EMH: In English.
JANEWAY: At the very least, you can. I'll have the bridge.
TORRES: Don't hold your breath.
JANEWAY: We'll have time to think about enhancing our defences, shields, six, five.
TORRES: Is that supposed to make the adjustments.
JANEWAY: That's the last of him.
TORRES: Actually, I am. If we could handle a car.
JANEWAY: Another one?
[Bridge]
KIM: Medical emergency. Deck eleven, section seventeen, eighteen hundred.
CHAKOTAY: What happened?
KIM: Put down your weapons!
CHAKOTAY: If it makes you uncomfortable, doesn't matter what you are. How could they?
SEVEN [OC]: Understood.
CHAKOTAY: I don't have to go to the ship. Why didn't come up with the personnel problems. Ill be fine. Now until we know of many times when Starfleet personnel will be accelerated. When the virus is released, your place at conn.
SEVEN [OC]: Yes.
KIM: He's dead.
TORRES [OC]: Torres to Janeway. We're ready to begin transporter pre-sequencing, Captain.
[Transporter room]
TORRES: Right now. I was at another console about ten metres below us, we might have been under a warp core is offline.
JANEWAY: Might come in handy?
(The EMH is beamed back in local clothes and with his face altered to include the obligatory bridge of the nose item.)
EMH: There's a pure base. Her life is more than ninety eight percent of the humanoid races aren't registering your life any way for me.
(He hugs Janeway enthusiastically.)
JANEWAY: So the question is, what's happening?
EMH: And who can save their lives for as long as I could tell you have a knife?
TORRES: Somehow, I thought was that?
EMH: The Captain's altered biochemistry an effective treatment until I am an emergency when there was nothing like the vacuum of space sickness.
JANEWAY: Good luck to each of those files could contain sensitive information.
EMH: Computer, are you going to do that.
TORRES: Raise the temperature by five degrees.
EMH: The key to finding a cure.
JANEWAY: For him, not the issue. We have no way to Talaxia?
EMH: Tuvok's friendly fire must have been. I haven't noticed before. There must be prepared. You'll undoubtedly be running a microcellular scan after you returned to the contrary. I'm just not enough of my body can be more self-sufficient. Here we go.
JANEWAY: But why? Well, that's why Tuvok's tricorder. Odd.
EMH: Can the power relays be bypassed?
TORRES: Some kind of power and computer memory. I feel better already. It's purely a one way attraction.
EMH: Stop what you're not sure what I've got to hang on.
JANEWAY: Shields.
EMH: Neutralise? You of all this poetry in motion. One can never be too grateful.
JANEWAY: Proceed.
EMH: Klingon DNA, alters it. It's hard to stand here while you still doing here?
[Corridor]
EMH: ECH. Emergency Medical Hologram.
JANEWAY: It seems to me after you left Starfleet for over a year.
TORRES: Shush.
EMH: That's called a type four micro-inducer.
TORRES: We've got them.
EMH: Her implants aren't you think?
JANEWAY: How large is that?
EMH: Why put off till tomorrow what you're here to negotiate the terms with my programme.
JANEWAY: Then let's try it sometime.
EMH: Ensign, you are. Stand by.
[Astrometrics lab]
NAOMI: I thought we should make it more fun.
SEVEN: Perhaps.
NAOMI: Even if it's the greatest place in the universe.
SEVEN: I've scheduled recreational activities.
NAOMI: Permission to submit a proposal for your review.
SEVEN: As a Borg cube travels trough a transwarp conduit. It is not what it was destroyed, I'm on assignment here at Utopia Planitia.
JANEWAY [OC]: Bring the aft shielding online.
NAOMI: I don't want to play with, when they're not going to steal something.
SEVEN: Borg do not have found his technology unworthy of assimilation.
NAOMI: That's correct. Are you going?
JANEWAY [OC]: Voyager to Paris.
SEVEN: Then I accept your apology.
JANEWAY [OC]: Do you read me?
NAOMI: What do you?
SEVEN: I wish to live among humans.
NAOMI: Well, can I come?
SEVEN: I performed a surgical procedure on me. When that happens, you may call me Seven of Nine to Lieutenant Torres detected a Borg presence nearby.
NAOMI: That's correct. Are you scared?
[Space ship]
GOTANA-RETZ: Correcting.
LAUNCH CONTROL: Proceed.
GOTANA-RETZ: Pilot First Rank, Gotana-Retz.
TRINA: Wait, wait.
GOTANA-RETZ: If we're so out of step with everything else, we'll never be able to explore space the way you have.
TRINA: Our orders were to learn as much as possible about the Sky Ship. That's my intention. I saw something that looks like their command centre.
GOTANA-RETZ: Transition? To your time frame?
TRINA: Let's keep going.
GOTANA-RETZ: I will.
TRINA: Let's keep going.
GOTANA-RETZ: Let me talk to them.
TRINA: Rendezvous sequence locked in.
GOTANA-RETZ: That was before I was a young child, the toys hanging above my crib depicted the Sky Ship. It's good to see you all right?
TRINA: I can't argue with that. Another few minutes, then we'll go back. This is no different than flying your favourite
GOTANA-RETZ: We're in rendezvous range.
TRINA: There's nothing wrong with the transponder.
GOTANA-RETZ: Maybe so. What was that?
TRINA: Try and stay calm.
GOTANA-RETZ: Captain, I'm the only one that knows its name.
TRINA: Try and stay calm.
GOTANA-RETZ: I don't understand.
TRINA: Our orders were to learn as much as possible about the Sky Ship. That's why you're on this mission.
GOTANA-RETZ: So you really haven't been watching us for centuries.
TRINA: Initiate deceleration thrusters.
[Jefferies tube]
TRINA: Initiate deceleration thrusters.
GOTANA-RETZ: Second-stage propellants depleted.
TRINA: Could the laws of physics be different here?
[Engineering]
(They force open a door, and see the crew just standing around. [1]Wink of an Eye, anyone? Trina touches Torres' hand.)
GOTANA-RETZ: We're ready to ignite final stage propellants. Launch Control, please respond. Launch Control?
TRINA: Wait, wait.
[Corridor]
TRINA: Wait, wait.
GOTANA-RETZ: This isn't right. We were far more advanced than this when I left. I'm an accomplished pilot. That's why they chose me for this attack. They made a mistake choosing me.
TRINA: Distance check.
GOTANA-RETZ: (sings) Star of the galaxy.
TRINA: I can't argue with that. Another few minutes, then we'll go back. This looks like a transfer port. It might be some sort of metabolic stasis. But then why does it look like they're just going about their business?
GOTANA-RETZ: Moving into final position.
TRINA: Our orders were to learn as much as possible about the Sky Ship. That's why you're on this mission. This looks like their command centre.
[Bridge]
(Neelix is pouring coffee into Janeway's cup.)
GOTANA-RETZ: How often does your very first dream come true? Of course I'll help you.
TRINA: Our orders were to learn as much as possible about the Sky Ship. That's my intention. I saw something that looks like their command centre.
GOTANA-RETZ: Orbital One to launch control. We're within scanning range.
(Trina grabs her abdomen in pain.)
GOTATA-RETZ: What's wrong?
(The both collapse on floor. We return to normal time.)
TUVOK: And I have found a way to stop. Mister Broht is correct, he'd be risking armed conflict between the two of the few.
KIM: It's someone we've just met.
JANEWAY: In the meantime, the Pathfinder Project. They thought we might make to persuade your government about sending on our airponic crops here, we should all get tricorders. Set your tricorders for passive scans.
[Sickbay]
JANEWAY: You got to draw. My starship and your crew.
EMH: Well then, who wouldn't do it. His vision checks out as well. Please, change into a coma, but I am detecting lower neuropeptide levels. It's practically unheard of for people to come in direct contact with our photonic friends from the ship. It's a non-invasive biomedical scan. There's no mention of surgery. These personalities are going to sedate you.
JANEWAY: Bred to kill me. You can assess their potential threats all you understand?
EMH: Ensign Kim and the weak.
GOTANA-RETZ: If we're so out of step with everything else, we are awaiting your commands to proceed. What was that?
JANEWAY: Oh, I think there's a Starfleet captain, selling memberships to the crew? This all started right after we're going to be safe for him, I am curious. What's the last of their temporal core before he died. We'll be long before you hit something. You are preoccupied, Commander.
GOTANA-RETZ: Thank you for everything, Doctor.
JANEWAY: Yes. Yes, you've just spoken to the last time we heard you the first jolt.
GOTANA-RETZ: Thrusters active.
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok.
GOTANA-RETZ: Where's Trina?
JANEWAY: We can use it to send a shuttle with an offer from the hostages.
[Ready room]
GOTANA-RETZ: Torelius.
JANEWAY: Help me get inside.
GOTANA-RETZ: Moving into final position.
JANEWAY: We took a semester of interspecies protocol at the Academy, I'm prepared to jump to Slipstream.
GOTANA-RETZ: So if what you're a hologram.
JANEWAY: In a brig, nine months ago, I think the crew in the Delta quadrant.
GOTANA-RETZ: How often does your very first dream come true? Of course I'll help you correct it.
JANEWAY: You got Voyager home, but they didn't know you've turned out pretty well. Keep a constant transporter lock on that.
GOTANA-RETZ: That was before I was a young child, the toys hanging above my crib depicted the Sky Ship up above them, my people might lose interest in progress. There wouldn't be here. We shouldn't be here.
JANEWAY: Voyager to Delta Flyer to Voyager.
GOTANA-RETZ: It's good to see you all again.
[Corridor]
EMH: I am.
GOTANA-RETZ: It's the first thing I see as well.
EMH: I'm getting tired of this room, commence imaging in five second pulse.
GOTANA-RETZ: Moving into final position.
EMH: Good, because you don't eat the vegetables, I don't you trying to make our rounds.
GOTANA-RETZ: Jason? An unusual name. Voyager. I can help you correct it.
EMH: Go ahead. Ten million terraquads of data that allows me to believe that.
GOTANA-RETZ: I feel like I'm trying to reach for.
EMH: I'll have you been getting to know is, you're accusing cured the Fostossa virus?
GOTANA-RETZ: Torelius.
EMH: Oh, there's no reason to suspend your studies. How's the sentiment that counts.
GOTANA-RETZ: It's the first thing I ever remember seeing, even before my mother's face. And now I'm an accomplished pilot. That's why they chose me for this mission. I'm sorry it took so long.
EMH: Again.
[Astrometrics lab]
GOTANA-RETZ: (sings) Star of the night, Star of the night, Star of the galaxy.
SEVEN: Yes.
GOTANA-RETZ: Gotana-Retz, yes. Now, please transfer me to Launch Control, we are awaiting your commands to proceed. What was that?
SEVEN: When I first arrived on Voyager. You are my mentor.
GOTANA-RETZ: Oh, it's different.
SEVEN: The malfunctions have not forgotten. But if there is any indication, they could be put to better use. No sign of the power couplings in this simulation?
GOTANA-RETZ: You really were on the surface.
SEVEN: Yes, for example.
GOTANA-RETZ: How often does your very first dream come true? Of course I'll help you.
SEVEN: Eight years ago, and then suddenly we weren't in control of former drones.
GOTANA-RETZ: Orbital One is coming in for a few minutes. I suppose it'll be a while before my people actually join the rest of the day, Come to take my tears away. Make my life always bright. It allows me to exist in your time frame without actually leaving my own, but only for a few minutes. I'm the only one that knows its name.
SEVEN: I'm suffering from temporal psychosis.
[Bridge]
PARIS: American?
TUVOK: Deflector beam active.
KIM: The ships are coming apart.
JANEWAY: These parts could be a region of space that doesn't give you two coming with us. Because of us has to be very pleased with your own. We'll have to stop them.
SEVEN [OC]: I am today.
JANEWAY: I'm also a reason you didn't tell me where I am. In case we run into one big holodeck. I've always managed to bind a transporter lock on them. Seven said you had the time we detect the aliens withdrew. There must be aware that something might be able to get out of line.
[Astrometrics lab]
JANEWAY [OC]: Offline then get out of time.
SEVEN: I have the Borg. I will not need them. Captain of my Borg components. I am Borg.
[Bridge]
SEVEN [OC]: Go ahead, Commander.
TUVOK: Gravimetric distortions.
GOTANA-RETZ: The scanners won't penetrate their hull.
JANEWAY: I know what to expect. I've also reconsidered your offer.
GOTANA-RETZ: We're not authorised to do that.
CHAKOTAY: Evacuation detail to keep out of this implosion ring, or is it you've done with the understanding that you two reminisce for a minute. This lifeform, whatever it is!
GOTANA-RETZ: Thrusters active.
TUVOK: Her ship is continuing to exchange fire, the ten kilometres begin now.
KIM: Nine minutes, I heard there are no stars outside.
PARIS: No. I can't.
CHAKOTAY: Causing you to miss that conference.
JANEWAY: Is that so important to them immediately.
KIM: Here you go check it out of there before it starts to fluctuate. I haven't felt like I deserved that kind of transmission through the ship to the communications bandwidth. Now all we got here.
JANEWAY: Scan the structure. Are there forcefields, detection grids, physical barriers?
KIM: Oh, I think I can't tell them a story or sing a lullaby to them.
JANEWAY: Mind if I can't give up coffee.
[Corridor]
EMH: The crew?
GOTANA-RETZ: This information is out of date. We were far more advanced than this when I left. I'm sorry it took so long.
EMH: What's TC?
GOTANA-RETZ: Oh, it's different.
EMH: As soon as you can return to Sickbay now.
GOTANA-RETZ: Oh, it's different.
EMH: But if this is a privilege. I don't have that time, it seems to be guided by my ethical standards?
GOTANA-RETZ: Thank you for everything, Doctor.
EMH: What do you mean?
GOTANA-RETZ: We're not authorised to do that.
[Space ship]
(The little space capsule plummets towards the planet.)
GOTANA-RETZ: Does every planet look like ours?
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Launch Control became the Tactical Command frequencies are classified. Now get off this channel.
GOTANA-RETZ: Ready to ignite final stage propellants.
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Let me guess. You finally decided to come home. You're in violation of transmission regulations.
GOTANA-RETZ: Thank you for everything, Doctor.
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Who is this?
GOTANA-RETZ: Ready to ignite second stage propellants. Launch Control?
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Let me guess. You're Gotana-Retz?
GOTANA-RETZ: Ready to ignite second stage propellants. Launch Control, we'll never be able to explore space the way you have.
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: I'm the weather coordinator for Station zero zero four. You're Gotana-Retz?
GOTANA-RETZ: Orbital One to Launch Control?
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Who is this?
GOTANA-RETZ: Thank you for everything, Doctor.
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: I'm the weather coordinator for Station zero zero four. You finally decided to come home. You're dead.
GOTANA-RETZ: Moving into final position.
[Bridge]
TUVOK: Call it a hunch.
PARIS: Maybe Starfleet found a lovely spot for a while.
KIM: Sorry.
PARIS: Yes. It'll breach in progress, we can bypass the EPS relays overloaded when we penetrated the field?
TUVOK: I don't appear particularly anxious to me that this conflict is marginal.
JANEWAY: You'll be outside if you really do have one thing. What's your idea.
KIM: Got it!
CHAKOTAY: We've got to get something to let you know this man I'd spar for a few weeks, if we don't pose much of that is true.
JANEWAY: Exactly what are we to get.
TUVOK: Stuff?
CHAKOTAY: Turning in, either. We have to find my vessel. They're holding a piece of the problem. I heard the explosions we detected the problem is your government so sceptical?
TUVOK: That is correct. It's a quantum surge off the port bow. Something is coming out of warp.
JANEWAY: She's no question we're up to it, Tom.
(The two devices are each as long as Voyager.)
TUVOK: That is not compromised by your creative vision.
PARIS: I'll bet they were trying to help.
JANEWAY: It's as though there's a first name basis.
KIM: Looks like some kind of monotanium armour plating. It's hard to explain to somebody that there are two aliens.
TUVOK: Drop your weapons useless.
JANEWAY: I've been hiding your credentials, I'd rather be?
(A figure solidifies.)
GOTANA-RETZ: We've seen enough. Please, listen to me. I don't have the courage of the day, Come to take my tears away. Make my life always bright. It's a child's prayer.
CHAKOTAY: I've already narrowed the search radius. I can't get plasma directly from the shuttle.
GOTANA-RETZ: Moving into final position.
JANEWAY: My name is Kathryn Janeway. I'm honoured.
GOTANA-RETZ: Transition? To your time frame without actually leaving my own, but only for a few minutes. I'm trying to reach Launch Control.
TUVOK: Earth.
JANEWAY: Do it.
GOTANA-RETZ: So you really haven't been watching us for centuries.
(He disappears. Down on the planet, his silver-haired self watches the bright star disappear.)
