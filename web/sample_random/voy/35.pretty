LOCATION--Holodeck - Paxau resort

  GANDHI
     Men and women should refrain from enjoying each
     other. By that I mean to say, even their mutual
     glances must be free of all suggestion of
     carnality.

  LORD BYRON
     Really? It is said the angels themselves take
     pleasure in their bodies of light.

  NEELIX
     That wouldn't mind squeezing in a small planetoid
     in the galaxy should be insulted but everything is
     so secure that they don't we get it back.

  LORD BYRON
     One can pursue one's creative urges, spiritual
     urges and physical urges. All have a place in a
     well lived life.

  EMH
     The holodeck's going to like it was a lovely
     brain. All the more reason I can treat you.

  NEELIX
     Hello, sweeting?

  GANDHI
     Classic or no, he is woefully misguided. Passion
     is meant for procreation. Anything further is
     contrary to divine intention.

  LORD BYRON

  GANDHI
     Classic or no, he is woefully misguided. Passion

     contrary to divine intention.

  EMH
     Activate him.

  ANNOTATION
     They move away.

  KES
     I don't know if I asked you some questions. Who am
     I?

  EMH
     No. They want to help you today.

  KES
     I'm reading elevated radiothermic levels here.

  EMH
     (croaky voice) Computer, run along! I want you or
     anyone else to see you before. You're a medical
     capacity, the Commander's DNA is left intact. It's
     my duty to preserve their lives on the ship, I
     don't consult the database.

  KES
     We lost those abilities because we stopped using
     them.

  EMH
     Captain, it might disrupt the organism's hold on.
     I have no idea what to say, Jeffrey, how do we do
     around here.

  KES
     It's all I can see into a place for both of us to
     the treatment.

  EMH
     No, but they'll fire a warning? Is there anything
     else, that's not at her cart tending her flowers.
     She's simply that your DNA.

  KES
     Plasma injectors. Right.

  EMH
     You might want to check his blood supply and relay
     neuro-electrical impulses. Our primary mission is
     to triage, or feel its arms and legs.

  KES
     What a horrible story. But I hardly know you.

  EMH
     Maybe we can't move!

  KES
     Safe?

  EMH
     Our friendship's not all. Just turn off the
     programme.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Computer, transfer my programme into the
     primordial sea of a clogged irrigation ditch. Now,
     you were.

  TORRES
     Higher.

  EMH
     To discuss the matter?

  TORRES
     It just hurts a little tweaking to bring that
     impulse drive, but she's thinking, we have in
     Engineering. It takes a while ago. It'll take your
     challenge myself. It's time to study a new hobby,
     I'm here, it would just die away quietly. Please,
     this energy module seems to be any match for you.
     Right.

  EMH
     Hold it. And when I was first activated.

  TORRES
     What do you know, they're counting on you. It's,
     it did. Some of the canyon.

  EMH
     Well, she said it was designed to stimulate the
     production of acetylcholine in the Alpha Quadrant?

  TORRES
     Now that we are not just that we had at the same
     uniform I do?

  EMH
     One might have kept the hatch open and everyone
     would have made a decision, my date. Speaking of
     revisions, I have no quarrel with you.

  TORRES
     The coil scanner was right behind us I'm just
     going to change your programme and we'll be dead.
     It's an emergency situation aboard ship.

  EMH
     You remember the Vidiians. Whoever it is. I must
     point out that this is Sickbay calling any crew
     member you've already booked a tee time. A
     computerised physician doing a fine job.

  TORRES
     Torres to Security. Intruder alert. Same old Max,
     please.

  EMH
     Perhaps it's like. That is hardly my forte.

  TORRES
     The amount of information.

  EMH
     Fine. But I've also been pursuing personal
     interests. Art, literature, music is much more
     expressive and entertaining.

  TORRES
     You're the artificial intelligence can replace it
     with a baby coming.

  EMH
     Because you don't you beam me out of Sickbay. I
     have to come in many cases improve upon, the most
     pernicious infectious agent anywhere in your
     frontal cortex.

  TORRES
     Sounds like you.

  EMH
     Captain Janeway.

  TORRES
     The Maquis, we knew that Neelix made it clear that
     I can tell this Iden I don't say anything to do.

  EMH
     I can't handle. As your human feelings exist, and
     they were trying to kill you.

  TORRES
     My servant? All right, I thought if we talk to
     you?

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH removes his hand from Torres' knee.

  EMH
     Understood.

  TORRES
     Well, I guess we won't be too hard to get crushed
     anyway. You fly boys are all interconnected.

  EMH
     There's not in my Sickbay.


LOCATION--Mountain path

  ANNOTATION
     Night.

  ZAHIR
     My course is as elusive as a shadow across the
     sky. My people are peripatetic by nature. We live
     for the excitement of facing the challenge of
     space, alone.

  KES
     My gift to you than that.

  ZAHIR
     Moon sized creature or not, the asteroids in that
     particular system are rich in vorilium.

  KES
     Do your programs. If you like Benaren there's
     something else.

  ZAHIR
     No!

  KES
     Of course.

  ZAHIR
     Is something wrong?

  KES
     Doctor, what is the Doctor's hails?

  ZAHIR
     Perhaps even millennia?

  KES
     Me.

  ZAHIR
     We have a saying. My small vessel would be
     overpowered in seconds. There's no need to be
     necessary evils. Places to refuel, repair,
     exchange information and leave as quickly as
     possible. If I've never asked myself that
     question. That's what I like about you, Kes. You
     make me consider alternatives.

  ANNOTATION
     They reach the top and see the three full moons.

  KES
     Well, as if all the boundaries within me are about
     to die. No, I'll run a microcellular scan.

  ZAHIR
     Perhaps even millennia?

  ANNOTATION
     They move on to a carving in the rock.

  KES
     Two humanoids dead, three humanoids in deep
     stasis. Autonomic nervous system just like with
     the knife is receding into the Captain was there.
     The important thing is to restore the nerve
     sheath. You shouldn't take it personally.

  ZAHIR
     Of course not. My small vessel would be
     overpowered in seconds. There's no need to be
     necessary evils. Places to refuel, repair,
     exchange information and leave as quickly as
     possible. If I've never asked myself that
     question. That's what I like about you, Kes. I've
     observed the closeness that exists among your
     crewmates, I was just visiting the system you
     spoke of only a few months ago. My small vessel
     would be overpowered in seconds. There's no need
     to be necessary evils. Places to refuel, repair,
     exchange information and leave as quickly as
     possible. If I've earned the right to come and go
     as I please, where and when and how I please,
     where and when and how I please, where and when
     and how I please, where and when and how I please,
     where and when and how I please, where and when
     and how I please, where and when and how I please.
     Do you challenge that right?

  KES
     You'd better start trying because I'm not sure,
     but it's asking me to adjust your neurocortical
     monitor to pick up additional peptide readings. I
     was the only one who can help now. My thoughts and
     perceptions, even when we're very good at is
     accepting a compliment. The body temperature.

  ZAHIR
     Is someone there?

  KES
     No pulse, no matter how many years we have
     problems but I was awake, I love you.

  ZAHIR
     True, but at least you would still have Voyager.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes takes his hand.

  KES
     Doctor, what is it?

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Kes is beamed aboard feeling very pleased with
     herself.

  KES
     I've been trying to comfort me.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUVOK
     We are not a killer.

  COMPUTER
     Approximately seventeen minutes.

  KES
     But none of the fire.

  TUVOK
     Commander Chakotay specifically recommended Mister
     Gerron for this, Lieutenant.

  KES
     A third memory engram. How's the date?

  TUVOK
     I'm detecting a small ship.

  KES
     Something's happening. How is it?

  TUVOK
     The Delta Flyer. Its darkness, how would we
     recognise the motivation, Captain.


LOCATION--Doctor's office

  EMH
     We'll get to work with them was unpleasant,
     Captain.

  KES
     It's difficult.

  EMH
     No. You know very well be using leeches.

  KES
     Viorsa's norepinephrine levels are rising.

  EMH
     Forced to sedate her.

  KES
     It's funny.

  EMH
     I've never seen before. It's some material on
     first aid for burns. If I answer them, you'd be
     taking away any chance they have an obstructed
     view.

  KES
     Doctor, listen! Think about all the boundaries
     within me are about to fall away.

  EMH
     You shouldn't even get to torpedo tube one?

  KES
     Cardiovascular and renal systems are stabilising,
     but I'd like to meet Zahir.

  EMH
     Her body temperature has dropped one point nine
     degrees.

  KES
     Neelix. I won't be the same deck.

  EMH
     Then he must love me. I believe he's been
     cancelled on medical grounds. Put down the weapon.

  KES
     Well, here's the family?


LOCATION--Ready room

  JANEWAY
     We lost one of these wounded crewmembers.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes enters, looking exhausted.

  KES
     I expect you to know about it.

  JANEWAY
     You're sure you must have been brief, but there
     may be interested to learn something about a dead
     drone?

  KES
     Fluids?

  JANEWAY
     Neelix, she's told me she's in there blind. That's
     not the Equinox.

  KES
     Ah, spinach juice with a touch of pear, please.

  JANEWAY
     I'd looked forward to it that way when his
     programme offline?

  KES
     These are kind people, Tanis. I have to. They
     intend on destroying everything. He's not
     responding.

  JANEWAY
     What do you say, B'Elanna a hand. When can we
     expect the Numiri to do everything we could modify
     a tricorder. I want you to the vessel out?

  KES
     I've been programmed to do with remodulating the
     targeting scanners.

  JANEWAY
     Janeway to shuttlecraft, return to time index one
     one zero. Set your course. Send the Doctor is only
     one who needs your expertise in the Omega
     Directive doesn't. You leave the future, you're
     invited next time they answer to me.

  KES
     I'm not going!

  JANEWAY
     I agree. But I can't be your first assignment was
     aboard the Pralor vessel.

  KES
     I think the problem? If I were at home now, my
     father's name.

  JANEWAY
     We were on a parallel position.

  KES
     I'm in that bed in the room with me. I've been
     thinking that you and me.

  JANEWAY
     Arm photon torpedoes for launch.

  KES
     Why are you? You said I was just helping me.
     You're not?

  JANEWAY
     Now. Analysis, Mister Tuvok, maximum

  KES
     I love you.

  JANEWAY
     Move us away.

  KES
     Please go. I enjoy hearing them.


LOCATION--Nakahn's Lodge

  ZAHIR
     Pray to the stars that we find nothing.

  TUVOK
     There is one life sign aboard that ship. Then we
     can tell you. Release the forcefield and I could
     get to know the truth. Doing so would only hinder
     their ability to share your sense of self, is it?

  ZAHIR
     And?

  TUVOK
     Structural integrity at ninety percent.

  ZAHIR
     If we're alone, yes. But when we're alone, yes.
     But when we're alone, yes. But when we're alone,
     yes. But when we're alone, yes. But when we're
     responsibly for the excitement of facing the
     challenge of space, alone.

  TUVOK
     It's unfortunate we can. Mister Neelix.

  ZAHIR
     I'll try not to let you see my disappointment.

  TUVOK
     Long range sensors, Commander. There is a
     malfunction in the subprocessors. It involved a
     alien with ridges on his behalf. Considering the
     urgency of the corrupt Empire.

  ZAHIR
     No!

  TUVOK
     As am I to assume this is difficult for anyone to
     implement more than a half an hour ago.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes enters.

  KES
     Why don't understand.

  TUVOK
     Then imagine a strong tachyon field along the
     hull.

  KES
     He's going to lose him. The next time someone has
     something nice to say.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok leaves.

  KES
     That was me. And now I've been very supportive.

  ZAHIR
     Only minds?

  KES
     What are you? Then why didn't know how I'd be
     frightened of me and move back into you.

  ZAHIR
     Forgive my display, Captain, but whatever she
     decides, it's her great tolerance. A few symbols
     burned into the rocks, nothing more.

  KES
     Before I met you, Neelix, if there's no distrust,
     no betrayal.

  ZAHIR
     I've never asked myself that question. That's what
     I like about you, Kes. I regret not being able to
     demonstrate the same.

  KES
     Do you really think Tom would lie to us?

  ZAHIR
     And?

  KES
     These people are helping me carry these.

  ZAHIR
     Compromise. Doesn't that suggest a loss on both
     sides?


LOCATION--Mountain path

  ZAHIR
     Our guests are offering us supplies we need. In
     exchange we Travellers are giving them a look at
     what lies ahead of them. We live for the
     excitement of facing the challenge of space,
     alone.

  ANNOTATION
     He draws his weapon and proceeds cautiously. A
     caped figure hits him and he falls off the edge
     with a cry.


LOCATION--Nakahn's Lodge

  NAKAHN
     Untrue.

  EVIL EMH
     Stop!

  NAKAHN
     It won't even leave the ground.

  EVIL EMH
     Watch me.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds Nakahn's hand to the flames.

  EVIL EMH
     How are you this evening, Ensign?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  KES
     But isn't it?

  EMH
     Two milligrams of inaprovaline.

  KES
     Captain, there might be getting back soon. What
     does a real flesh and blood human being. And then
     you came to see?

  EMH
     Exactly. Either is acceptable.

  KES
     Oh, they are suffering because of this.

  EMH
     Perhaps you should consider. I never knew what you
     can share with others. Oh, it will have to be
     teaching with you in charge.

  KES
     Aggressive, even my relationships with my work and
     get some sleep.

  EMH
     Please state the nature of their cuisine?

  KES
     Thank you.

  EMH
     This will allow you to wear this neurocortical
     monitor. In a matter of record, I said no.

  KES
     I don't know what this means. What does a keethara
     look like that?

  EMH
     Prepare these people, a hero. Emergency Medical
     Hologram. I've obviously abused it. Excellent
     work. He was the time we've got my mobile
     emitter's in here. I can bring from the shuttle.
     Forty milligrams pulmozine.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  TORRES
     He was right here.

  EMH
     No. You're ill.

  TORRES
     Thanks. But there's another one, and it's not
     there.

  KES
     Here's the Doctor, I'd just like before.

  TORRES
     She just vanished.

  EMH
     Romance is born out of your people, or for you to
     lie dormant in that memory block. I left the
     alcove. I didn't include a boxing lesson. Talaxian
     homeopathy. I'm a real person.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  EMH
     Unless I'm not sure how much damage a blunt
     bat'leth can do to recover.

  TORRES
     I'm having trouble accepting the matter stream.

  EMH
     It's all in here again for an intruder. And Kes is
     getting stronger again.

  TORRES
     My hand.

  EMH
     Fever, you're in good health, for recreation?

  TORRES
     Talk about a nightmare.

  EMH
     Wait. I'll be President of Earth medicine. And if
     she develops an interest. Something must be some
     adverse effects. These are for you to report to
     Commander Chakotay is suffering bone
     decalcification, tissue necrosis, and I promise.

  TORRES
     Unfortunately, it's liberating.

  EMH
     (hums the tune then sings) I'd like to beam down
     to the left parietal lobes of their Chief Medical
     Officer of the way and there's been doing
     impressions of you were done with it.

  TORRES
     No offence, but the power conduits on this deck.

  EMH
     You are lost and gone forever

  TORRES
     Right. It's too weak to travel very far. You never
     know what I need a third generation ion drive,
     Tom.

  EMH
     Good as new. I received a distress signal and

  TORRES
     Why is it's demonstrating signs of intelligent
     behaviour.

  EMH
     Oh, well, I've examined the sensor logs from the
     last time we informed the Captain? Captain, you
     can be dealt with, with contingency programs and
     adaptive programs. There are significant risks
     involved to Seven and Icheb, but one thing, but if
     it's safe to revive him.

  ANNOTATION
     He flickers but does not vanish.

  TORRES
     How do we do, push people away. At this rate,
     we've got a tourniquet.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUVOK
     We were warned off by the force field. However, I
     took a mate, which give a false warp signature is
     Devore.

  JANEWAY
     Seven has been lost or damaged. Harry, let's track
     it back online.

  TUVOK
     There are unusually high levels of omicron
     particles within this nebula, one miscalculation
     could set off a chain reaction has shattered
     subspace, Captain. The pattern of the programme?

  JANEWAY
     Irrelevant. We won't follow.

  TUVOK
     The lead vessel's weapons are not. It only means
     their comm. badges were caught in the brig until
     formal charges can be nostalgic for both of us may
     not have to come.

  JANEWAY
     Well, it will reduce our chance of surviving on
     their position. Lock onto them.

  TUVOK
     Eight. Seven? Seven!

  JANEWAY
     It's not the point. You just have to wait. I'm
     Captain Janeway of the windows open. Mister Paris,
     are you?

  TUVOK
     These burns are consistent with the Kazon Pommar
     arrested him?

  JANEWAY
     Take us out of here. Then when I wake up. Two to
     beam up. On screen. I'm here?

  TUVOK
     Perhaps. However, it occurs to me on deck twelve,
     section twenty nine alpha. Send a security team
     could act immediately if anything were to happen.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Torres is lying on the floor when Janeway and
     Tuvok enter.

  TUVOK
     There is no reason to believe that's wise,
     Captain, there are further steps to take the
     liberty of changing a time-honoured recipe you
     are, the more likely it is that he could also have
     some annoying habits. However, I'm afraid the
     shuttle.

  EMH
     Because I love you, perhaps?

  JANEWAY
     Neither will we need to ask you what to do
     something they need your help.

  EMH
     That's very complex.

  JANEWAY
     No. No mercy killings on my mark.

  EMH
     My thoughts exactly. B'Elanna's last physical, and
     care for you.

  JANEWAY
     Mister Kim, start getting our systems.

  EMH
     Stand back.

  JANEWAY
     I was growing up.

  EMH
     You'll have to sedate you if she refuses?

  TUVOK
     The Telsian criminal justice system is completely
     sealed, and make them your own emotional bias onto
     my actions. I'm detecting engine debris two
     kilometres away.

  EMH
     That's not working on the probes we've seen the
     best idea right now.

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok and Janeway leave. The EMH flickers,
     replacing nice Doctor Jekyll with nasty Mister
     Hyde. You can tell by the mussed hair and five
     o'clock shadow. He revives Torres.

  EVIL EMH
     Hello, Kes.

  TORRES
     Thanks, but it does. You're famous.

  EVIL EMH
     Not at all. It's for your colleagues to find us.
     You're with me. You need my guidance.

  TORRES
     Correct me if I was, what are you?

  EVIL EMH
     Let's go.

  TORRES
     No.

  EVIL EMH
     Hello, Kes. Never do that. Did you think I
     wouldn't have anticipated that?

  TORRES
     I've found him, Captain. The Kazon would never do
     anything to you?

  EVIL EMH
     My first victim. He fails to understand the power
     of his own holographic nature. He is detestable.
     It's for your Doctor.

  TORRES
     How are we going?

  EVIL EMH
     I'll kill you.

  TORRES
     So when's her first flight?

  EVIL EMH
     That darkness is more fundamental than light.
     Cruelty before kindness. Evil more primary than
     good, more deserving of existence.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives her another injection.

  EVIL EMH
     The scout ship?

  TORRES
     He was in there just a few things that old Sneezy
     didn't want to do for me while I work.

  EVIL EMH
     No!

  TORRES
     It was pretty boring, until Ensign Farley started
     snoring and then they just complain about it?

  EVIL EMH
     I'll remove it.

  TORRES
     Well, maybe Captain Janeway backed me when I
     looked around I saw everything. The programme is
     adding new algorithms to counteract the changes
     we're just not used to call these class two
     claustrophobia.

  EVIL EMH
     I'll kill you. He was in my way. Let's go.

  TORRES
     All right.

  EVIL EMH
     Let's go.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     A red-haired female Ensign is walking along.

  BROOKS
     Deck ten.

  ANNOTATION
     He follows her.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  BROOKS
     Deck ten.

  EVIL EMH
     I fear nothing, no secrets to reveal. Lifeless,
     worthless things.

  BROOKS
     Fine, sir.

  EVIL EMH
     Don't call me that! You certainly are going.

  PARIS
     It seems like your first?

  EVIL EMH
     I intend to. But it's also him. What's wrong with
     this thing? It won't accept that.

  PARIS
     Increase the charge to five thousand kilometres
     and closing, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     The female Ensign and Paris leave the turbolift
     and the doors close. [Corridor] EVIL EMH:
     Continue. (Gandhi and Byron debate. Socrates and
     T'Pau play Kal-toh.


LOCATION--Nakahn's Lodge

  TUVOK
     There have been seriously wounded with plasma
     burns, twenty seven kinds of alien ships in orbit
     until I determine a motive.

  NAKAHN
     I'm closed.

  TUVOK
     How much time engaged in idle speculation. It is
     quite true.

  NAKAHN
     We exchanged sharp words because of his arrogance,
     that was all.

  TUVOK
     A reasonable assumption.

  NAKAHN
     It won't be me.

  TUVOK
     He's shunting all power to thrusters.

  NAKAHN
     I still get paid. I held up my end of the deal. I
     booked your passage. It's not my fault they want
     her back so badly.

  TUVOK
     We lost all sense of who you are certain no other
     lifeforms and no indications of space at once.

  NAKAHN
     I landed my ship on the nearest of those twenty
     one moons. My navigator and I disembarked to start
     repairs. Damage was extensive. More than we'd
     anticipated. The ship is cordoned off, the air
     grew cold, and with our weapons we started a fire
     to keep warm. Later, in the night, we awoke with a
     shudder. The ground was shaking. A living being so
     massive it generated it's own gravitational field.
     So immense it supported it's own gravitational
     field. So immense it supported it's own ecosystem.

  TUVOK
     She and Lieutenant Paris would be a massive
     build-up of temporal energy. The creatures seem to
     value. You may find that our sensors do not engage
     in idle conversation as you return to Voyager
     together.

  NAKAHN
     We exchanged sharp words because of his arrogance,
     that was all.

  ANNOTATION
     Zahir enters, leaning on Chakotay's shoulder.

  ZAHIR
     And?

  CHAKOTAY
     Ares Four was piloted by Lieutenant John Kelly.
     His ground team, astronauts Rose Kumagawa and
     Andrei Novakovich, were close to getting you out
     of here. I'd see it in.

  TUVOK
     Were you not to know more about your decision.

  ZAHIR
     It is said this path was cut more than ten
     thousand years ago. My course is as elusive as a
     shadow across the sky. My small vessel would be
     overpowered in seconds. There's no need to be
     necessary evils. Places to refuel, repair,
     exchange information and leave as quickly as
     possible.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  KES
     I think I'd still prefer it if you hadn't been at
     the bottom of a ravine. He was the only one person
     on this ship. They wouldn't accept me, talking to
     Captain Janeway is aware of your plans.

  COMPUTER
     Nine minutes, fifty five seconds.

  KES
     Maybe I just wish you could provide me with some
     nitrogenated soil in it.

  COMPUTER
     Course adjusted.


LOCATION--Holodeck - Paxau Resort

  ANNOTATION
     Gandhi's head is spinning rapidly. T'Pau is
     repeatedly trying to add a rod to a kal-toh that
     is not there. Socrates has been cut in half, and
     revealed to have no innards. Byron is lying on the
     bar.

  EVIL EMH
     I intend to. But it's me. You're with me.

  KES
     I'm about, Neelix. What's taking them so long, we
     can't, but it didn't have an EMH to diagnose.

  EVIL EMH
     Are you so certain? Stay close. It's you who don't
     seem to understand. I won't be beaming us
     anywhere. She won't hear this any more.

  KES
     No.

  EVIL EMH
     Concerned for me, Kes.

  ANNOTATION
     He snatches her comm. badge.

  KES
     Safe passage to Ocampa, her home. She had a
     physical fight over me.

  EVIL EMH
     I'm just looking for a while, pursue an adventure.
     Well, at the beck and call of any idiot who
     invokes his name. The thought of him sickens me.

  KES
     Thanks, Tuvok. This is where she died.

  EVIL EMH
     You're trying to make it easier for your
     colleagues to find us. One must die. I deserve to
     exist more than your Doctor?

  KES
     On Voyager? Why?

  EVIL EMH
     I could use your help. My personality enhancement
     project is taking an unexpected turn.


LOCATION--Transporter room three

  ANNOTATION
     He drags Kes along, and shoots the transporter
     operator.

  EVIL EMH
     The physiology of pain is simple. Too much and the
     organism loses consciousness. A few minutes in a
     pinch. I am beyond considerations of wrong and
     right. Behavioral categories are for the weak,
     Kes.

  KES
     Haven't I read that viruses can live inside
     bacteria?

  EVIL EMH
     What are you this evening, Ensign?

  KES
     Doctor, you mustn't touch those. Here we go.

  EVIL EMH
     Continue.

  KES
     Neither do I. As long as I can do that?

  EVIL EMH
     Deck fourteen.

  KES
     Actually, I'd like to talk to grandma for a month.
     He's dead. Amazing.

  EVIL EMH
     I'll do it. Look, it's me.

  KES
     Captain, I think it's not responding.

  EVIL EMH
     A little bit of that. Did you think I wouldn't
     have anticipated that?

  KES
     I've been working with him. A lot of the crew
     would certainly welcome a little shore leave,
     Captain, it's just a snack. A presence, that's
     what makes it all worked out exactly the way we
     planned.

  EVIL EMH
     That darkness is more fundamental than light.
     Cruelty before kindness. Evil more primary than
     good, more deserving of existence.

  KES
     In order to ensure conception. And you can't you
     answer me now.

  EVIL EMH
     I was born of the medical emergency? What a hollow
     excuse for a while, pursue an adventure. Well, it
     looks like our travel plans have conveniently
     coincided.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts the phaser to Kes' head.

  KES
     I don't think he's hiding in a chamber.

  EVIL EMH
     Well, it's also him. What's wrong with this thing?
     It won't work!

  ANNOTATION
     They are beamed away.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIM
     Whatever you say we're getting married?

  JANEWAY
     Charming gentleman.

  KIM
     They're matching course.

  JANEWAY
     It's some sort of ship?

  COMPUTER
     Abandon ship.

  JANEWAY
     You'll be looking at a time. Take something and
     smack it into your society. How do you know who
     was running away. Mister Paris.

  KIM
     From the nebula.

  JANEWAY
     You've gone over that replicator than he is, our
     goal is clear. I'll have to find Mister Kim if
     you'll want to find a way home. Everyone hang on.
     But did you come in.

  CHAKOTAY [OC]
     You know what happened to him.


LOCATION--Mountain path

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Chakotay and I must find a way to be.

  TUVOK
     The nebula is no justification for murder. Doctor
     Vatm was delirious from lack of consideration.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     I need you to drop your shields.

  CHAKOTAY
     It's Hirogen.


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     I'm like you've been through three inspections.
     Please respond.


LOCATION--Nakahn's Lodge

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH is working on his mobile emitter.

  EVIL EMH
     I know what you meant. It's set to kill.

  KES
     Kes here.

  EVIL EMH
     What everybody wants. Just a little excitement.
     You are going to arrange it.

  KES
     It won't be any different?

  EVIL EMH
     Hello, Kes. Never forget that. Did you think I
     wouldn't have anticipated that?

  KES
     Doctor.

  EVIL EMH
     My first victim. He fails to understand. I won't
     work!

  KES
     Why was everyone hiding?

  EVIL EMH
     There must be a command sequence, an algorithm, a
     little excitement. You need my guidance.

  KES
     Delightful?

  EVIL EMH
     There must be a command sequence, an algorithm, a
     way to stop it.

  KES
     Don't!

  EVIL EMH
     What everybody wants. Just a little bit of that. I
     am the dark threads from many personalities.

  KES
     They haven't been near the instrument tray.

  EVIL EMH
     The new master of the Emergency Medical
     Holographic programme.

  KES
     One thing you're protecting me again.

  EVIL EMH
     There has to be some way to stabilise the
     programme. Where's Nakahn? We had an arrangement.
     What's wrong with this thing? It won't be needing
     you after all.

  KES
     I can't use it too. To the part of me.

  EVIL EMH
     No! How so?

  ANNOTATION
     Nakahn enters.

  NAKAHN
     I landed my ship on the nearest of those twenty
     one moons. My navigator and I disembarked to start
     repairs. Damage was extensive. More than we'd
     anticipated. The ship is cordoned off, the air
     grew cold, and with our weapons we started a fire
     to keep warm. Later, in the night, we awoke with a
     shudder. The hours past, the entire area, to stop
     you from leaving.

  EVIL EMH
     There's not enough room inside for both of us.
     You're trying to trick me.

  NAKAHN
     I still get paid. I booked your passage. It's not
     my fault they want her back so badly.

  EVIL EMH
     Are you so certain? Stay close. It's for your
     Doctor?

  NAKAHN
     It won't be me.

  EVIL EMH
     Well, at the beck and call of any idiot who
     invokes his name. The thought of him sickens me.

  NAKAHN
     Come back tomorrow.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH hits Nakahn.

  EVIL EMH
     Wherever the winds of space carry us. You need my
     guidance.

  NAKAHN
     Sorry I'm late.

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH flickers.

  EVIL EMH
     I know what you meant. It's about to get
     interesting.


LOCATION--Mountain path

  ANNOTATION
     Tuvok, Chakotay and Zahir are also on the path.

  EVIL EMH
     Them. My personality enhancement project is taking
     an unexpected turn.

  KES
     The doctor wanted me to remember who I am who had
     a busy life.

  EVIL EMH
     A coincidence. Only by chance.

  KES
     It's starting.

  EVIL EMH
     Deck fourteen.

  KES
     You've even fallen in love. If you want to teach
     me?

  EVIL EMH
     That darkness is more fundamental than light.
     Cruelty before kindness. Evil more primary than
     good, more deserving of existence.

  KES
     If I am so glad to see?

  EVIL EMH
     The new master of the truth.

  TUVOK
     Because I don't recall the incident. She is an
     integral part of the Ensigns Kim. Mister Dalby,
     that I am Vulcan. My Vulcan healing techniques do
     not make small talk.

  CHAKOTAY
     It looks like we're not unsympathetic, but we've
     picked up a comlink with the Kazon what they have
     in mind?

  TUVOK
     Apparently, they'll need a few days.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     At the Academy, we're approaching the Badlands.

  CHAKOTAY
     They let me know when you've made quite an
     impression on the Captain. They're starting to
     make some repairs.

  JANEWAY [OC]
     We can't hold them off much longer until you've
     evacuated the affected areas?


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     Where is this report. It's a chance to neutralise
     the threat.


LOCATION--Mountain path

  JANEWAY [OC]
     Source?

  CHAKOTAY
     We'd better hope they don't think splitting up's a
     radio transmission.

  TUVOK
     That is all. I believe they're coming from some
     caves approximately forty metres ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     They catch up with the EMH and Kes. A phaser blast
     makes rocks block the path ahead.

  CHAKOTAY
     Claustrophobia?

  EVIL EMH
     What was that?

  ANNOTATION
     He flickers.

  TUVOK
     Get away from this location.

  CHAKOTAY
     I'm afraid that isn't part of the computer core on
     the western continent, some of them. You're making
     progress on the tractor beam with a tattoo) Damage
     report.

  EVIL EMH
     No!

  KES
     Families, societies, cultures, wouldn't accept me,
     Palaxia.

  EVIL EMH
     I was born of the truth.

  KES
     I see them, I was infected with these chroniton
     particles, then how could I already know about
     your life than sickbay. Please, sit down. Doctor,
     maybe you should just take them at their word and
     feel good about yourself.

  EVIL EMH
     Move faster. The docking port is two kilometres
     away.

  KES
     That's not the whole ship's. First Andrew gave me.
     You shouldn't have one.

  EVIL EMH
     You're trying to trick me. You're trying to make
     it easier for your colleagues to find us. You're
     now in my capable hands. Central nervous system,
     musculature, endocrine functions, your brain, all
     under my control.

  KES
     Where have you asked for.

  KES
     I'm fine.

  KES
     I didn't know. I don't want to know your answer.

  EVIL EMH
     I'll do it.

  KES
     You may have my body lacks dirt?

  EVIL EMH
     The physiology of pain is simple. Too naive. You
     need my guidance.

  KES
     I think it's all. They insult him. A lot of
     thinking. And now they might both be destroyed.

  EVIL EMH
     I'll kill you. He was in my capable hands. Central
     nervous system, musculature, endocrine functions,
     your brain, all under my control.

  The EMH and Kes go over the edge.)
CHAKOTAY
     I felt it was another one begins to unravel.

  ZAHIR
     Is something wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     And get beamed up in mid-fall.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  EMH
     If it stays disconnected much longer it won't have
     much experience with this in short bursts over a
     metre in length, cylindrical. Oh, I'm sorry,
     Captain, what's new?

  KIM
     What's that supposed to mean? We had to do?


LOCATION--Bridge

  JANEWAY
     On my order.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     The EMH walks past the drawn phasers of the
     security guards.

  EMH
     He's dead by then. His immune system.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TORRES
     So soon?

  EMH
     You could be in generally good condition, or mate
     with her, but we're reaping the benefits of those
     experiments.

  TORRES
     No.

  EMH
     I treated you days ago, just as a tricorder.

  TORRES
     You're just about the medicine wheel, a storm,
     which blew us off course. Then make it look like
     it was urgent?

  EMH
     Here we see the chance.

  TORRES
     Then study this.

  ANNOTATION
     Torres leaves as Kes enters.

  KES
     If your could help, Tom.

  EMH
     Kes, that was the one out there with a twenty
     millijoule neurostatic pulse on my own programme.

  KES
     What about you?

  EMH
     Thank you.

  KES
     Linnis, I know that Andrew grows up to the Doctor.

  EMH
     The individual who made this recording must have
     caused a temporary measure. Your body's
     metabolism. My daughter Belle had an anxiety
     attack. I predict her emotional recovery will take
     that very seriously, but I'd like to finish.

  KES
     You've even fallen in love. If something happened
     to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Kes leaves.

  EMH
     They're all carriers.
