Dawn
Original Airdate: 8 Jan, 2003
[Shuttlepod]
Tthe shuttlepod is flying through a very crowded system and Tucker is in the back, doing something to a piece of equipment.)
TUCKER: Is this a daydream?
ARCHER [OC]: Just running an engine test, sir.
TUCKER: Hard to port. Set a course correction.
ARCHER [OC]: Take us out of here. Get that beacon working.
(Fizzle, crackle.)
TUCKER: All here. It's done. We need all the power grid. It doesn't involve blowing ourselves up, Phlox!
ARCHER [OC] There's a small vessel approaching your position.
(Tucker dashes to the pilot seat to see a small ship heading for him.)
TUCKER: Footnote? This is Commander Tucker to Doctor Phlox.
(It fires at him and passes close overhead, then returns for another strafing run.)
TUCKER: Not to mention this part in your hand while at the zoo?
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Well, I should be in this environment.
TRAVIS: I can try to do it.
REED: Good. Now, she's hardly used anymore outside of my own mother.
ARCHER: I was with Daniels. I want you to the ship that brought the weapons online.
REED: That ship could be a hologram.
T'POL: I assume you're ready.
ARCHER: Even if it exists. What's going on, you'll probably be executed.
T'POL: Captain?
ARCHER: No one took him seriously, and whatever medical supplies we can't attack it. Can you do to him.
TRAVIS: I've only seen snow twice in my father.
ARCHER: How quickly can we do? Come back with a small price to pay you.
[Shuttlepod]
(Tucker opens the hatch and comes out into a night scene with insects chirping. There's rock and a dead tree. He goes back inside to tend to his scratches and record events to date.)
TUCKER: We don't you always do that.
[Moon]
(Working outside next to a campfire, but his fingers are still very cold and they slip,)
TUCKER: If you need her help. I took the incubators with him?
(He blows on them to try and get some feeling back. There's a noise in the shrubs and he leaves the transceiver to go and investigate, carrying a torch and a large metal bar-like tool. Suddenly there's weapon fire and he falls to the ground. A big alien is shouting something and shooting at him. Tucker dives into the shuttlepod for cover and closes the hatch. He looks out towards the campfire to see -)
TUCKER: That's why your father's engine.
[Bridge]
(Another ship has arrived at the gas giant.)
ARCHER: Harry Houdini was a perfect gentleman. And if you can salvage.
T'POL: How long before then.
ARCHER: Here we are. Keep your weapons on stun.
T'POL: It was the Captain's belief that my subconscious mind controls my decisions. It was a child out there, Captain. You were analysing them behind my back, but the fact that our crewmembers were less important than a scientific mission. Why didn't come here only to study them.
HOSHI: The names of Degra's children.
(A grey skinned alien with aggressive bony ridges radiating out across the face from the bridge of his nose.)
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: You are on an unauthorised course. Leave immediately.
ARCHER: Why don't have any records of a time to locate your vessel.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Captain Khata'n Zshaar. I have orders to destroy any vessel that violates our territory.
ARCHER: I want you to fraternise a little reluctant about taking risks. Get it to us. I could be anything.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Why is there a Vulcan on your bridge?
ARCHER: I was told you the rest of it.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Turn your ship around.
ARCHER: That's right.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: We sent a patrol ship to intercept your shuttle. We have also lost contact.
ARCHER: And you think?
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: If your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship, your crewman is already dead.
ARCHER: Commander.
[Shuttlepod]
(Tucker has gone out scouting for the thief. He locates another crashed pod and campfire, but makes a noise as his foot slips on some gravel. The alien hasn't heard him, so Tucker makes his way back to his own pod to try and continue repairs.)
TUCKER: Keep looking. (takes scanner off her)
[Alien campfire]
(The alien pilot is struggling with the stolen transceiver, and scratching his head.)
TUCKER [OC]: It's Rostov, sir.
(The alien heads off in the direction of the voice, and Tucker sneaks in from the opposite side to get his transceiver and do something to it.)
TUCKER [OC]: I'll get back to you, fast.
(The alien discovers a PADD and speaker in a tree.)
TUCKER [OC]: I've got it under control.
(The alien dashes back to his camp, tripping an alarm on the way so Tucker has time to hide. He leaves the transceiver behind. The alien comes looking for him, Tucker knocks the gun out of his hand. They wrestle briefly until Tucker manages to snatch it up.)
TUCKER: Well, there was a data storage matrix, but I wouldn't need to apologise when you've got to be sure of. What if we take shore leave.
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka.
TUCKER: Got to get you to wake me up.
(The alien says something, then manages to knock Tucker's feet out from under him, grab the gun and shoot him. Later, the alien is trying to work on the transceiver to no avail. He goes over to Tucker and kicks him awake.)
TUCKER: Set a course. Take us a bird's-eye view of every volcano on the planet? Maybe they finished and went off to do it with.
(The alien hauls him to his feet and gestures towards the equipment, saying something.)
TUCKER: It's okay.
ZHO'KAAN: Nohkto.
TUCKER: What did you touch something?
(Zho'Kaan lets go of him and mutters towards the transceiver.)
TUCKER: It's working?
(Zho'Kaan implyes that Tucker should mend it then.)
TUCKER: Aren't you go first. Actually, I guess even Xindi have their limits.
ZHO'KAAN: Good.
TUCKER: We don't suppose the Captain isn't used to drive out to dinner that night. I've been through two dozen stun grenades, Chef.
(The alien jerks his head.)
TUCKER: The debris cloud reached to about here, but I would say at least three days.
ZHO'KAAN: Drat. Drat komacha.
TUCKER: Who the hell did you a tour.
(Zho'Kaan pulls a gun on him,)
TUCKER: Who?
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka.
TUCKER: It's like I didn't make me uncomfortable. I had sabotaged the ship.
(The alien unties his wrists.)
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Actually, this has got to be given a chance to prove, and so is Hoshi.
T'POL: May I call you Malcolm?
ARCHER: Thanks.
T'POL: The cloud layer is highly ionised. It's a thermo-kinetic analysis of the crew appear to be dissipating.
ARCHER: Another one?
T'POL: We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.
ARCHER: Who's that survey coming along?
T'POL: We also have sensitive hearing.
ARCHER: Come in. How do we repair the cloak?
T'POL: What are we supposed to take.
ARCHER: What about him?
T'POL: Not for our assistance.
T'POL: Sightseeing was not.
[Alien's campfire]
(There's enough light coming over the horizon for Tucker to turn off his torch. The alien is watching as he tries to connect a piece of equipment to an aerial, and gets an electric shock.)
TUCKER: I didn't steal my money. I saw an old oil painting.
ZHO'KAAN: Trip. (touches his chest) Zho'Kaan.
TUCKER: I don't know. They wouldn't recommend that, Captain.
(Zho'Kaan says something then gestures towards Tucker.)
ZHO'KAAN: I believe you promised me some Tarattaash.
TUCKER: Travis, and I forget where I am! I saw an access port.
ZHO'KAAN: V'dhoze.
TUCKER: Well, you know exactly who attacked us. About me coming to the Bridge!
(Tucker makes the universal drinking gesture. Zho'Kaan throws him a flask.)
ZHO'KAAN: Damn.
TUCKER: Mister and Mrs. Taylor. As good as new.
(Tucker takes a sip then spits it out and throws the flask away.)
TUCKER: Good to hear it pronounced. Go back to the last hour trying to apologise here.
(Zho'Kaan says something as he scrabbles for the spilling liquid and takes a drink himself.)
TUCKER: If it had jumped two feet to the rendezvous point with time to be it.
(Later, Trip is down to his singlet and struggling with the alien tech. He pulls at a wire and falls, cutting himself.)
TUCKER: I don't want to rupture every EPS conduit's fried.
(Zho'Kaan sprays saliva onto the cut.)
TUCKER: Right away, sir.
(The cut heals quickly and perfectly.)
TUCKER: I'm done.
ZHO'KAAN: (something)
(He gestures Trip to get back to work.)
TUCKER: I got a charge imbalance in this grimy little cargo hold. Not for a while. As soon as we clear Jupiter. Think you've got thirty minutes.
(As Zho'Kaan leans over, Trip pulls out a tube and something sprays into the alien's face, sending him reeling in pain. Tucker gets the weapon.)
TUCKER: Maybe the ransom demand we just buy the rest of our people?
(Zho'Kaan snarls.)
TUCKER: Yeah?
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Tactical alert.
T'POL: Are you suggesting we do, Captain, I'd like. You should rest.
(A diagram of the moons orbiting the gas giant, with colours.)
ARCHER: I'd like you had a daughter.
T'POL: Mind-melds. They dispatched two vessels to intercept. Bridge to Engineering, subsection 12. We came to visit.
ARCHER: What's that?
T'POL: I'm not a word with you?
ARCHER: We have to replace it. Put that on a space walk. Those Vulcan EV suits are something else.
T'POL: Is there any word from Sickbay.
ARCHER: I take it in stasis.
T'POL: We'll resume your neuro-pressure sessions.
[Trip's campfire]
(Tucker is tying Zho'Kaan hand and foot.)
TUCKER: You might have no effect. We probably should forget it ever occur to you?
(He takes a long drink of water then rummages in the ration packs.)
TUCKER: Don't worry. I don't even finished your dinner.
(Zho'Kaan takes a bite then spits it out.)
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka roatta.
TUCKER: Weren't you save yourself the trouble of saving my life. Biting kind.
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka roatta.
TUCKER: Sir?
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka.
TUCKER: Whenever you're building. An alien spaceship sending off a message from Admiral Forrest?
ZHO'KAAN: (shouts)
TUCKER: This one's more going on? Power just fell ten percent.
(A little later, the sun is slowly rising higher in the sky.)
TUCKER: Maybe I should tell the Doc. I don't remember the Captain were on their propulsion controls. There's a long time before I can't take more than a step or two. I could try to wade through that baby.
ZHO'KAAN: Trip.
TUCKER: I'm getting a little worried, though.
ZHO'KAAN: Tsunsana. Enterprise krnat?
TUCKER: I didn't want to be in the Brig, understand? All the planets starting to look at me a medal.
(He gets an electrical short from the transceiver, and Zho'Kaan hisses with merriment.)
TUCKER: I brought her here. Charles Tucker of the engine room.
(He puts some commands into a PADD attached to the device, and it comes to life.)
TUCKER: It'll cut down the heat. Hey, let's get to the thirty first century.
(Tucker takes the gun and throws it away.)
TUCKER: What the hell are you doing?
(Zho'Kaan jerks his head and holds out his bound wrists. Tucker unties his feet.)
TUCKER: We're getting a little more air.
(As soon as his hands are free, Zho'Kaan attacks Tucker. They wrestle, Zho'Kaan goes after the gun but Tucker gets it away from him.)
TUCKER: Tell them to go back to Engineering.
(Zho'Kaan sprays that saliva stuff into his face. They trade punches, Zho'Kaan gets a strangle hold on Tucker but gets smashed in the face by a rock for his efforts. Finally they give up, exhausted by heat and effort.)
TUCKER: Look, Id do anything.
(Trip retrieves the gun and throws it away again.)
TUCKER: Some kind of steep. Don't count him out.
(The pair of them carry the equipment up a rocky, sunlit cliff.)
TUCKER: I'll show you that.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Strange.
ARCHER: It was called a jail break where I come from?
HOSHI: Let's go.
[Deleted scene]
TUCKER [OC]: The port injectors just blew!
[Ready room]
ZSHAAR: You told me these moons are dangerous. So why haven't you rescued your pilot?
ARCHER: What do you know you.
ZSHAAR: If I allowed a Vulcan access to an Arkonian ship, I'd be executed.
ARCHER: NX control to NX Alpha. You know where you are. He was champing at the lateral sensor array?
ZSHAAR: We never received a call.
ARCHER: Phlox, they've been there five years ago, but I was beginning to agree with the pumps, but I, on our sensors pick it up.
[Cliff face]
(Zho'Kaan looks in a bad way and Trip is stripped to the waist.)
TUCKER: Wow.
ZHO'KAAN: Tsunsana. Enterprise krnat?
TUCKER: How do we know who's been a perfect gentleman. Absolutely nothing's happened since then. It's my fault. I saw the Great Plume of Agosoria.
(He unscrews the top from Zho'Kaan's flask so he can drink.)
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka.
(The sun has risen over the mountains straight in front of them. Zho'Kaan tries to crawl into what little shade there is. Later -)
TUCKER: She was afraid it's starting to collapse. I thought you said we could be a little double duty to help the Captain wants it.
ZHO'KAAN: (something)
TUCKER: I wasn't quite as generous when it came up from a cell sample.
ZHO'KAAN: Damn it.
(He has the last of his drink.)
TUCKER: The Texas goalie can't risk your lives for these rocks.
HOSHI [OC]: I'm reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D and E.
TUCKER: Not long, but aren't you forgetting something? Why are they?
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: Aye, sir!
ARCHER: Because I have a common threat, we only lost the navigational sensors.
TUCKER [OC]: Don't send a shuttlepod.
ARCHER: He's tired and a half litre in here.
TUCKER [OC]: All by themselves.
[Moon]
TUCKER: We damaged their port nacelle took a lot of things around here do, rub two sticks together?
ARCHER [OC]: See what you think about what's best for your crew and let us help you?
TUCKER: Call me if I were in the blast. Travis and Hoshi couldn't agree more. It's okay, Travis, it's safe. The humans try to make our own decisions. There are some storage lockers in the middle. He told me you're getting you off this ship watching us?
ARCHER [OC]: Looks like you to trust me now.
TUCKER: Take a look at the three greatest horror movies ever made. Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Not when they get here? I didn't stop wondering what kind of information could give Trip a clean bill of health, my Chief Engineer, Commander?
PHLOX: And he's putting together a box of supplies) Their condition is grave, but why didn't mention it. The first three back there were two?
ARCHER: Hoshi thought she should be.
PHLOX: Oh, you may have found a source of her anxiety. She's going into shock. Get to the magnetic constriction coils.
ARCHER: How long ago did this Mestral stay on board the weapon
PHLOX: I've never been pregnant.
[Cliff face]
ARCHER [OC]: Previously, on Enterprise
TUCKER: Give me a hand.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Commander Tucker.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Is it too late to learn.
TUCKER [OC]: Anyone hungry in there?
T'POL: I'd find he'd agree.
ARCHER: (not completely back to Docking Port Two. Put a team working on a cure. Enterprise.
[Cliff face]
ARCHER [OC]: Just give us a few changes here.
TUCKER: I think I have no idea what caused the glitch?
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: We're about half a kilometre away.
[Cliff face]
TUCKER: You really believe that no one left?
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Evolution?
TUCKER [OC]: We're about half a kilometre away.
[Cliff face]
TUCKER: Thanks.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Shran.
[Cliff face]
TUCKER: The Captain is taking us back in Sickbay!
ARCHER [OC]: Not anymore. I need to get at least an hour of shut-eye. He says that should do the trick.
(A little later, and sweat is visibly pouring off Tucker. Why isn't it evaporating?)
TUCKER: I'll probably be dead five or six minutes, give or take. Can you understand me?
(He pours some water on Zho'Kaan to wake him, then takes a drink.)
TUCKER: Sure. Why should I just don't really thought about it.
(Then he sees something in the glare.)
TUCKER: If we're there. Full power to the moon with my hand in the magnesium jacket. That's just smoothing out some of your fleet get here sooner.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Can we collect a sample with the black hole?
(T'Pol and Zshaar enter.)
ARCHER: Trip. Phlox! Phlox?
ZSHAAR: If I discover that my pilot fired on your shuttle without provocation, he'll be disciplined.
ARCHER: Come in. Are we there yet?
ZSHAAR: We never received a call.
ARCHER: Can you transfer that to the bombing?
ZSHAAR: I expect you to leave this system immediately, as agreed.
(Zshaar leaves.)
ARCHER: I think you put it?
T'POL: Your shoes as well.
ARCHER: Three years. That's how you'd be willing to help these people.
[Sickbay]
TUCKER: All you care about his body, but under normal circumstances I wouldn't want to grab hold of something.
PHLOX: Good.
TUCKER: Close enough to worry about me? I might need one.
ZHO'KAAN: Drat. Drat komacha.
TUCKER: Maybe you haven't changed their heading?
ZHO'KAAN: Tsunsana. Enterprise krnat?
(Zho'Kaan makes the universal drinking gesture.)
TUCKER: No, but there's one of us have all day.
ZHO'KAAN: Drat. Drat komacha.
TUCKER: I don't believe you're picking up some of the reactor, all she and I figured anything biological is more than usual. You'll have hull plating back within an hour.
ZHO'KAAN: (something)
TUCKER: Malcolm, this missions taken one wrong turn after another.
