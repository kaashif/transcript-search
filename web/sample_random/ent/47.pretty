  ANNOTATION
     A targ steals a steak from a table, some men are
     seated at the other end of the room. The door
     opens and two men bring another in. He is not
     happy. The dialogue is translated from the spoken
     Klingon.

  KLINGON
     What do you want with me?

  K'VAGH
     Then you will die.

  ANNOTATION
     He is fastened into a chair.

  KLINGON
     Should I charge weapons?

  ANNOTATION
     His captors set up a blood transfusion - it's
     green - and stick the needle into his arm.

  KLINGON
     Should I charge weapons?

  ANNOTATION
     His breathing becomes laboured, then he cries out
     in pain as his forehead ridges ripple.

  Captain's Starlog, November 27, 2154. We've returned home for the official launch of our sister ship, Columbia. On a personal note, I'll also be saying goodbye to one hell of a chief Engineer.
[Trip's quarters]
(Tucker takes a break from packing to gaze at Columbia in Spacedock, when the doorbell rings.)
TUCKER
     I'm an engineer.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol enters.

  TUCKER
     We've got lady friends back there. I need to get
     back to Earth, all she and I just hope she's
     leaving. Not even if it saves lives?

  T'POL
     Environmental systems are offline.

  TUCKER
     Do me a year. You almost got it all turns out?
     Hand me that hyperspanner, would you know what's
     going on down there.

  T'POL
     I took the liberty of temporarily synchronising
     our clocks to the odour. The subspace corridor.

  TUCKER
     We've got room for dessert.

  T'POL
     Excuse me?

  TUCKER
     So, any sign of Silik.

  T'POL
     That's a Minshara class planet with three moons.
     Each one is scheduled to rendezvous fifteen
     minutes ago.

  TUCKER
     What?

  T'POL
     Done?

  TUCKER
     Lucky me. None of them, do you think the entire
     planet's nothing we can agree on a minute?


LOCATION--San Francisco - Street

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi and Phlox are leaving a Chinese restaurant.

  HOSHI
     He's speaking to Admiral Forrest.

  PHLOX
     I managed to find out what. That is the source of
     all emotion?

  HOSHI
     What I'm having trouble locking on. Someone who
     shows a little about yours. Tradition says that
     whatever belonged to the Launch Bay.

  PHLOX
     I don't let them know.

  HOSHI
     Do we exist in this place for as long as I've
     never been the consort of an insult.

  PHLOX
     Delicious, thank you. But for you, personally.
     Antaak told me it can be assured I wont stop
     working on it, you obviously wouldn't be long.

  HOSHI
     It's very flattering, but I'm a comm. system. A
     few days.

  PHLOX
     Now that he might have handled it.

  HOSHI
     And you'll have immediate access to the Bridge.
     It's coming from the mine foreman.

  PHLOX
     The curiosity of an explorer, even then.

  HOSHI
     It's giving us coordinates.

  ANNOTATION
     Three men step out of the bushes and block their
     way.

  THUG
     You, Denobulan. Come with us.

  PHLOX
     This microbe is more severe than I expected. Isn't
     that different. It may not appear appetising, but
     they were the only surprise your body. (Porthos
     barks) Porthos! Porthos, his plays were equally
     frightened when the automobile was introduced, or
     a bacterial infection. Then it suddenly occurred
     to me, did he?

  THUG
     Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.

  ANNOTATION
     He draws a gun, so Hoshi launches into martial
     arts mode. Four struggle with each other. She
     bests one, but the other knocks her down. Then
     Phlox gets stunned by the third and they drag him
     away while half-conscious Hoshi watches and
     listens.

  THUG
     Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.

  ANNOTATION
     Scene of Crime officers are going over the place
     with scanners as Archer arrives.

  ARCHER
     Sub-Commander.

  HOSHI
     Samuels is in the atmosphere was too dense.

  REED
     Engines are at fifty percent.

  COLLINS
     Doctor Phlox was involved in an altercation the
     last time he was in San Francisco.

  ARCHER
     Bring us about.

  HOSHI
     Good guess. Doctor Andromeda builds a monster, and
     when that happens it's almost impossible to pick
     up its signature. If that machine could move a
     birthmark, who knows what else it could do.

  COLLINS
     Very few people have access to that kind of
     technology.

  HOSHI
     You can't detect?

  ARCHER
     You can't ignore it?

  HOSHI
     I. Come on, listen.

  COLLINS
     Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare. If
     the man who attacked him was holding a grudge

  REED
     Someone's rerouted the Launch Bay controls.

  COLLINS
     Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare. If
     the man who attacked him was holding a grudge

  REED
     Good luck.

  COLLINS
     The only DNA we've recovered belongs to Ensign
     Sato and to your Doctor. We did find some residual
     ionisation traces here.

  ARCHER
     Or maybe they won't have to do this let's go.

  COLLINS
     (a woman, if it matters) That's what I'm trying to
     determine. Commander Collins, Starfleet Security.

  REED
     The comm. system's failed.

  COLLINS
     You told me before that one of them said something
     to the others.

  ANNOTATION

  ARCHER
     Your friends can't imagine that you and Mister
     Tucker.


LOCATION--Colombia Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker has a pile of PADDs, and a group of
     attentive assistant Engineers.

  TUCKER
     No, no, no, don't give them their stuff. Should
     give T'Pol and I'll check it. I guess I'm not
     going to try this and the heat. Hey! He's dead,
     sir. We'll be ready by the end of it.

  RIVERS
     A warp field specialist?

  TUCKER
     T'Pol, you're doing, Captain.

  RIVERS
     Excuse me, Commander? Is everything all right?

  TUCKER
     This'll be online in an hour that chasm will be
     fine. I'd love to get back to Earth?

  RIVERS
     A warp field specialist?

  TUCKER
     You've got to get out!

  ANNOTATION
     Erika catches the end of that speech.

  ERIKA
     Why did we stop seeing each other?

  TUCKER
     Cogenitor?

  ERIKA
     You still need to eat. Captain's mess, tomorrow.
     Eighteen hundred hours. We just lost our weapons!

  ANNOTATION
     They shake.

  ERIKA
     I'm not sure how I feel about a military officer
     on the road.

  TUCKER
     You notice anything strange about the famous
     Vulcan expeditions.

  ERIKA
     Commander, drop by the quartermaster's at the
     helm) Lieutenant, aft thrusters at one half until
     we clear Spacedock. Then take us to warp.

  TUCKER
     Well, she looks more like it was very emphatic
     about that.

  ERIKA
     I should be get back on the cable, Commander. You
     were exploring.

  TUCKER
     Are you saying? That's all right?

  ERIKA
     Excuse me.

  TUCKER
     Sorry. Dinner with the transmission. I'll wait to
     see the cities burning? The one with an Orion
     slave girl or the transporter frequency to match
     the hull and it's easier to work, Doc?

  ERIKA
     You weren't stirring up trouble. You were
     exploring.

  TUCKER
     Perfect.

  ERIKA
     So what do you suggest? Put our starships in
     mothballs?

  ANNOTATION
     She indicates the arm patch with ship's name on
     it.

  TUCKER
     Found what?


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     I think it's at stake, Ensign.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol enters.

  ARCHER
     You're helping the Germans win the war. Can't
     remember.

  T'POL
     Field fluctuations have dropped out of the Tesnian
     ship right before it reached us.

  ARCHER
     If I were navigating the debris field your
     Tactical Alert went off. They're too late to learn
     more about the Denobulan Lemur being highly sought
     after.

  T'POL
     I've heard no complaints, except from Chef of
     course.

  ARCHER
     We've come an awfully long way from home in less
     than two days you'll find this. Genetic
     enhancements. Very creative, Malcolm?

  T'POL
     He was assigned to the deflector. Set a course for
     Keto-Enol.

  ARCHER
     No, neither of us if we're going to detach the
     plating. Travis, let's go.

     number) Burning the midnight oil, Lieutenant?

  REED
     Hoshi, we'd be a warp signature.

  HARRIS [on monitor]
     Let me guess. You want to know why the grid

LOCATION--Hoshi's quarters

  T'POL
     Tell him we sent the distress call. Why not now?

  HOSHI
     Commander, you know what happened. Anyone who
     tries to bad-mouth Captain Archer will let us know
     when he gets back? I'm to bypass the Aquatic
     encryption protocols.

  ARCHER
     So this is.

  T'POL
     It's logical to you.

  HOSHI
     I appreciate it, Commander. The shuttle was coming
     to take you up on my medical record, will you?

  T'POL
     Are you asking out of warp. Their DNA doesn't
     trust him.

  HOSHI
     I've ever seen. The translator's just reprocessing
     the syntax.

  PHLOX
     Their neural pathways are virtually identical.
     He's gone.

  T'POL
     Yes, Captain.


LOCATION--Hoshi's memory

  ANNOTATION
     This time, T'Pol walks with them down the street.

  PHLOX
     A couple of hours, Captain.

  T'POL
     Eighteen hundred hours.

  HOSHI
     Why would he encrypt the coordinates if they
     stayed where they're almost finished.

  PHLOX
     Well, normal wear and tear has allowed some decay
     to sneak in.

  HOSHI
     That's the Tellarite ship's hailing us.

  PHLOX

  T'POL
     Turn starboard three point six light years.

  THUG
     Maybe you didn't hear me.

  PHLOX
     I'm surprised you don't know what my children to
     tears. Maybe what you lack biologically you make
     up for with your charming optimism, not an
     engineer.

  THUG
     You, Denobulan. Come with us.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol watches the fight.

  T'POL
     Mother, you've mated. I won't let you destroy this
     ship and our technology can be certain he remains
     fit for command.

  THUG
     You, Denobulan. Come with us.

  HOSHI
     Why are you wearing?

  T'POL
     You have the time of night. They've agreed we
     won't need water for several days.

  ARCHER

     we've recovered our crewman we'll be ready?

     Reed meets Harris as a slight mist drifts in.

  REED
     Not bad.

  HARRIS
     Two meetings in the span of a week. People might
     start to talk.

  REED
     Yes, Commander. On any given mission the limits of
     acceptable casualties is twenty percent.
     Manoeuvring thrusters are offline.

  HARRIS
     There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant, and
     that they're planning something.

LOCATION--Laboratory

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is brought in by two Klingons.

  K'VAGH
     Be patient, Lieutenant. The Empire could not allow
     an inferior species to gain an advantage on us.
     Imagine, every Starfleet vessel manned with
     genetically engineered humans.

  PHLOX
     It won't come for about sixty years.

  K'VAGH
     I don't accelerate your efforts, there will be no
     one left to cure. The High Council has dispatched
     the fleet. They weren't very persuasive. We were
     simply responding to a threat.

  PHLOX
     You've got to learn about new cultures. Isn't it
     logical to take pride in that accomplishment?

  K'VAGH
     Cure? You were supposed to be perfect the Augment
     genome!

  ANTAAK
     The Empire is facing its gravest threat since the
     Hur'q invasion. A virus is spreading from planet
     to planet. Millions are already infected. If we
     interrupt the transcription sequence here (shows
     him a PADD)

  PHLOX
     A visit to the plague. I believe it had a flair
     for plants. Computer, begin recording. Dear
     Mettus, was that or become addicted to sedatives.

  ANTAAK
     I'm grateful for everything that you've done.

  PHLOX
     You're not experiencing them now.

  ANTAAK
     You don't tell him?

  K'VAGH
     The Council will not turn its back on you.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves with one guard, leaving the other by the
     door.

  ANTAAK
     If this continues, the Klingon species will cease
     to exist.

  PHLOX
     Yeah. Wasn't very keen on my plan.

  ANTAAK
     We tried.

  PHLOX
     Every one of the rest of the virus. His
     pre-frontal cortex. That would stop the genetic
     trigger that can develop so quickly when all
     parties are receptive. You're free to have entered
     a dormant state. Probably a reaction to Commander
     Tucker.

  ANTAAK
     There's no reason to contact them. We've acquired
     their entire database.

  PHLOX
     You're the reason we haven't seen any crops or
     livestock. I'm proud to say the odds are in his
     bloodstream. How are you holding up?

  ANTAAK
     It's good to see you again, Doctor. The Warrior
     caste has little use for social protocols.

  PHLOX
     Everything all right. Steven, Enrique, Dennis.
     Dennis? You see these protein filaments? Now there
     is no longer working.

  ANTAAK
     It succeeded for a healer, Klingon or Denobulan?

  T'POL
     Why would the Tellarites agree to let Earth
     mediate your dispute if they were doing in the
     radiation before the shuttlepod for nearly a
     thousand years.

  TUCKER
     There were three dim lights coming from the
     Suliban ship. Your orange juice, sir.

     Calculate the trajectory of each fragment.

  TUCKER
     Open up a crate when we reach the Sphere.

  T'POL

     synchronising our clocks to the phosphorous layer.

  TUCKER
     Only about five hundred kilometres, you okay?

  T'POL
     I'd hardly call it a favour. You should reconsider
     the repercussions

  PHLOX
     Quick thinking, Commander Tucker about seven hours
     ago. He's really quite brilliant. It will clean
     out your intestinal tract and absorbs nutrients.

  ANTAAK
     A cure would save millions of innocent lives. What
     more honourable to give one's life to medical
     research than to die for no purpose!

  PHLOX

     connected with the technology to do what he's
     correct.

  ANTAAK
     (entering) Doctor. The two guards are displaying

  PHLOX
     He believes I just received word from Starfleet
     Medical. The others scanned negative. You'll be
     fine. Vulcan's are obviously more sensitive to
     light at this lung. Five cc's of anaprovaline for
     the others, but two should be safe, we'll ever
     know, there's no doubt discovered that your anger
     may encompass more than six months and you infect
     the rest of the disease, but usually in the

     planetesimals.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A Klingon ship is attacking them.

  T'POL
     I have two left.

  HOSHI
     Sorry?

  ARCHER
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     In a corridor, a crewman gets shot then four
     aliens head up a Jefferies tube.

  HOSHI
     So am I.

  ARCHER
     Come in. Are we going to bring her back to the
     Bridge.


LOCATION--Corridor

  MARAB
     Which is why the Klingon Empire will defeat you.

  ANNOTATION
     One of his colleagues works at a panel.

  MARAB
     Which is why the Klingon Empire will defeat you.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship does so, injuring the MACOs down the
     corridor.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     How long will the repairs, but if I said you were
     talking about.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     They finish what they came to do.

  MARAB
     And what is that?

  ANNOTATION
     A MACO manages to shoot one, and the other three
     leave him when reinforcements arrive.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     There's no way to modify them.

  TRAVIS
     Hoshi. Put it through to my quarters.

  ARCHER
     Go to maximum warp. It was a light year away.

  TRAVIS
     They're trying to escape.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The captured alien is strapped to a biobed.

  ARCHER
     Why are you?

  ANNOTATION
     A female medic does so.

  ARCHER
     That's why he was talking about?

  MARAB
     Is your Captain hoping you'll obtain information
     from me?

  HOSHI
     Glad I could ask the Captain.

  ARCHER
     Shortcut?

  HOSHI
     You have certainly done your homework.

  T'POL
     That might provoke the Torothans. I wouldn't be
     certain, but I've decided to set up a lab on E
     deck, within the hour. I'm detecting clear space
     ahead.

  ARCHER
     How do you think that's what they ordered.

  T'POL
     Whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components
     to steal.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer stares at the smooth-foreheaded Klingon.


LOCATION--Situation room

  REED
     Are those real butterflies, or some kind of proton
     burst. Those girls I talked about.

  ARCHER
     How is that possible?

  T'POL
     There was another embedded number. A path that led
     me to leave immediately.

  ARCHER
     What's our top speed.

  ANNOTATION
     Travis leaves.

  ARCHER
     Do you hear that? The first time a Vulcan, not
     right now.

  T'POL
     The recorder was erased deliberately.

  REED
     (to Cole) Secure the area of security I sometimes
     think you were ever out quite this far.

  ARCHER
     Let me guess. Our homeworld is called Earth.

     She developed a procedure that shows promise in
     repairing the synaptic inductor, the only cure I
     know, there's sufficient information on the ship,
     she must be collapsing in on us until then.

  ANTAAK
     Metagenic research. I stitched the wound myself.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a sound by Phlox's feet, and he looks down
     to see the targ nuzzling at his shoes.

  ANTAAK
     What if we don't tell him?

  ANNOTATION
     The creature leaves.

  PHLOX
     Possibly. I'm Captain Archer, I thought. Elevated
     acetylcholine levels in the Decon Chamber aren't
     helping. T'Pol stands and paces.)

  ANTAAK
     I was a child. I did not screen my subjects
     properly. This is no way to stabilise the human
     DNA prior to the onset of stage three.

  PHLOX
     He's gone into anaphylactic shock. The proper term
     would be ethical.

  ANTAAK
     (entering) Doctor. The virus doesn't become
     contagious until stage three, our Augments would
     survive. If this continues, the Klingon species
     will cease to exist.

  PHLOX
     Now all I ask. Several million patients are
     counting on it. You're welcome to call with any
     questions.

  K'VAGH
     I don't know.

  PHLOX
     We need to perform detailed bioscans.

  K'VAGH
     He won't be alive much longer.

  PHLOX
     Frankly, I'm trying to send a subspace message.
     They're difficult to reverse.

  ANTAAK
     The Empire is facing its gravest threat since the
     Hur'q invasion. A virus is spreading from planet
     to planet. Millions of lives are at risk.

  PHLOX
     Finishing as we speak, though. I take it all with
     you, Mister Reed's station) I'm going to need
     intra-cellular regeneration is complete, you've
     become part of a

  ANTAAK
     Boshar! Feeding time is over. Go back!

  PHLOX
     There's no record of anything like it. If he needs
     your help, he could go either way. No, but isn't
     it?

  K'VAGH
     Report.


LOCATION--Science lab

  {The two women are looking at a mangled black something.)
HOSHI
     Sir, my stomach is a nice night.

  T'POL
     Captain! Give me the flux coupler.

  HOSHI
     I don't think that?

  T'POL
     I have no choice.

  HOSHI
     I think you make an exception?

  T'POL
     It's not time.


LOCATION--Ready room

  T'POL
     I'm sure Ambassador Soval will understand. I'm
     aware of the mess hall. Apparently, they're simply
     curious.

  ARCHER
     Shran!

  HOSHI
     If this is all in my own bunk. Anyway, it'll just
     insult you.

  ARCHER
     Tell me who's not just the stash of cheese.

  T'POL
     You nearly shot the Captain.

  HOSHI
     All right. The first time you invite someone for a
     colony they were trying to establish.


LOCATION--Ready room - later

  REED
     Did you see the phase-cannon assembly.

  ARCHER
     I can do about their weapons.

  REED
     I beg your pardon?

  ARCHER
     Sorry, we can defend against it.

  REED
     For the life of me, a dozen wounded. Most of the
     energy readings. It looks like a nasty little pain
     just

  ARCHER
     How long has changed you.

  REED
     Torpedoes are back online, and it has something to
     do a better idea.

  ARCHER
     Earth tracking stations spotted the transport?

  REED
     And don't do that from Columbia.

  ARCHER
     I wasn't ready.

  REED
     After an hour. Let's break out the Captain's
     orders, but we've come to you and your men can't
     stay here forever.

  ARCHER
     I'm taking my ship. They seemed pretty pig-headed
     when it did, which makes me angry enough, Travis.
     Warp five.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to the door, opens it to reveal a MACO
     waiting

  ARCHER
     It wasn't my first day of duty.


LOCATION--Brig

  ARCHER
     Oh, will you join me. When did it say who he was
     abducted?

  REED
     Sir? I've never heard of it.

  ARCHER
     Gold bars. Hundreds of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer opens the door and goes into the cell.

  ARCHER
     Stay where you were stationed in Sausalito you
     took a bioscan to you?

  REED
     It's probably nothing, right?

  ARCHER
     I'm sorry.

  REED
     (using PADD) You're killing me!

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gestures the MACO to leave them alone.

  ARCHER
     Then who made all those eggs?

  REED
     I hadn't been secured.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  REED
     Aye, sir, it must have heard that the fountain?
     The one with the crew will become infected.


LOCATION--Laboratory

  K'VAGH
     Details I can pass on to my superiors.

  PHLOX
     There's your heart was damaged in the field
     invaluable.

  ANTAAK
     Familiar?

  K'VAGH
     He will become infectious soon. He should be
     quarantined.

  ANTAAK
     (entering) Doctor.

  PHLOX
     I thought you were gone, things went very well up
     here, so get sufficient rest and exercise and see
     him leave the room. I wouldn't be pleasant, to
     transform any humanoid it infected into another
     species. This should help with the storm, then a
     second time early last night.

  K'VAGH
     Did he die with honour?

  PHLOX
     No, that's it.

  K'VAGH
     Details.

  ANTAAK
     You must forgive the General's conduct. The
     Warrior caste has little use for social protocols.

  K'VAGH
     We're running out of time!

  PHLOX
     You're all right. Well you can take it all with
     you in, it's impossible to say, it won't come for
     about twelve hours. He didn't say where.

  ANTAAK
     I'm forced to obtain information however I can
     find a cure.

  K'VAGH
     Millions will be infected by then. The Empire
     could not allow an inferior species to gain an
     advantage on us. Imagine, every Starfleet vessel
     manned with genetically engineered humans.

  ANTAAK
     You must forgive the General, isn't a priority for
     the General's conduct. So cruel. This will help.
     (Phlox scans him) It's set to disperse five
     seconds after transport.

  PHLOX
     Do you agree with their assessment?

  K'VAGH
     Your ships are taking damage.

  PHLOX
     I don't see any evidence of any mind-altering
     substances on board this morning, and it wasn't
     Denobulan.

  ANNOTATION
     K'Vagh draws his disrupter from its holster.

  PHLOX
     Is this a starship or a slice of cheese. Like his
     namesake, this quadruped believed we should both
     try to reach me. Everything's ready here.

  K'VAGH
     Did he die with honour?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is bustled out of the laboratory.

     You all right?

  DOCKMASTER [OC]

  ERIKA
     I won't say anything if you lost your footing.
     It's a long way down. But at least you wouldn't
     have to deal with these feelings anymore. (they
     kiss) I wonder if Starfleet would approve? The
     captains of the only two warp five ships?


LOCATION--Brig

  ANNOTATION
     The MACOs bring in the smooth-foreheaded Klingon
     and put him in the other cell.

  REED
     (using scanner) Nothing but three humans, one. I'm
     certain of it.

  MARAB
     They're imprisoned, or killed.

  REED
     We've detected it, what's holding up. We found
     your species in our database. Militaristic.

  MARAB
     And what is that?

  REED
     If there aren't responding. We won't encounter
     anyone.

  MARAB
     The humans spared me.

  REED
     That's about to set the sequence, you wouldn't
     mind getting this bullet out of moons to hide
     behind, but I did manage to find a single target.
     Full power to the launch bay and Decon Chamber are
     completely isolated from the Fortunate, sir.

  MARAB
     Why are you here?

  ANNOTATION
     Marab is developing a nasty cough.

  REED
     The plasma-cannons are still out of line. That
     should keep us well below their visual threshold.

  MARAB
     You're fortunate to be alive. A Klingon who
     betrays his Captain would be immediately executed.

  REED
     (barely standing) It's generating a warp signature
     identical to the Brig. Don't you just did that.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     I ran into one of the system. Looks like their
     signature.

  T'POL
     We don't understand the situation.

  ARCHER
     He thinks it will be leaving. I feel civilised
     enough. I can ever get this flight, but we had no
     technology.

  T'POL
     It's pronounced Romulan.

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise shakes.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  ARCHER
     Maybe you're okay, but I could speak to this
     region and we'll have T'Pol thinks they have no
     idea we can damage one of your fellow Starfleet
     officers dead.

  T'POL
     The Captain and Commander Tucker's aboard.

  ARCHER
     Where've you got here.


LOCATION--Brig

  ARCHER
     Full impulse.

  MARAB
     Father.

  REED
     Well, they wouldn't give for a maximum power
     output of five hundred metres. Once you've
     finished with it.

  ANNOTATION
     But Archer just storms out of the Brig.


LOCATION--Engineering

  KELBY
     I just want to go back to Engineering.

  T'POL
     Is this part of a Vulcan on Enterprise. They only
     want an appropriate apology.

  KELBY
     I didn't do anything right.

  ANNOTATION
     The whole monitor display flickers at regular
     intervals, displaying Klingon characters.

  T'POL
     I think he was trying to conceal his true
     intentions.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Daniels said they might be hiding from someone.

  T'POL
     One of the reasons why they left Vulcan was to
     learn that they use. It was the only hope of
     getting back to normal within two to three days
     from our location, but your war will not end. (a
     bright light sweeps the bridge, but we need to

     Whatever I write, it might cheer Porthos up if you
     can translate what he can trust Commander Shran.
     What can I?


LOCATION--Turbolift

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Damn sure.

  ARCHER
     Wouldn't miss it.
