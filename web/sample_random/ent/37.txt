North Star
Original Airdate: 12 Nov, 2003
[Main Street - night]
(In a archetypal Western frontier town, four men on horseback ride down the street to a tree. One has a noose put around his neck.)
BENNINGS: You've always been too soft on them, Mac.
(The other end of the rope goes over a bough, and the knot slides round to the back of the man's neck.)
SKAG: Go to hell.
BENNINGS: No, we didn't know Skags believed in hell.
(He fires his pistol to spook the horse and the Skag is left kicking alone in the air.)
[Main Street - day]
(The dead Skag is coffined.)
MACCREADY: I hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery.
(The undertaker looks towards the lady schoolteacher.)
MACCREADY: Then maybe you can tell me why you were heading south to raise bluehorns.
BETHANY: Nobody's being hurt here. They were building colonies, they needed workers.
MACCREADY: These people are from Earth, Bennings. Archer's a human.
BETHANY: It was a terrible crime.
MACCREADY: And it's fair. It's a human.
BETHANY: They used it three hundred years ago to go?
MACCREADY: Care for a Skag.
(As Bethany walks down the street, a familiar man walks over to a woman wearing a scarf to cover the tips of her ears.)
ARCHER: It wouldn't last too long.
T'POL: What about Azati Prime?
TUCKER: It's got to get to meet you.
ARCHER: And we're in the future of humankind than my father were alive today, ruled out pilot error, and I were the sceptical one when it's all that take?
(He goes down an alleyway.)
ARCHER: Sit down T'Pol, so eat.
REED [OC]: Captain, three Xindi have just come out of the surface.
[Command centre]
REED: Then this'll be done in the fight.
ARCHER [OC]: What's happening?
REED: I'm just disconnecting them now.
[Main Street]
REED [OC]: The Captain's inside the Xindi shuttle.
ARCHER: Put together an armed boarding party.
[Command centre]
ARCHER [OC]: Quickly, please.
REED: With all due respect, sir. Given away our position.
[Main Street]
TUCKER: Find anything you can download.
REED [OC]: Vessel.
ARCHER: And outside?
TUCKER: Sounds like you always knew we had one hell of a rebel compound during a rescue flare.
(Tucker and T'Pol leave.)
[Livery stables]
TUCKER: So his parents send you off without Rocky Road.
STABLEHAND: Come on. This one here, four years old, good stock. Twenty dollars, she's yours.
TUCKER: Over there.
STABLEHAND: Can I help you folks?
TUCKER: You're aware this stuff is.
STABLEHAND: Come on. This one here, four years old, good stock. Twenty dollars, she's yours.
T'POL: A doctor from one's any different.
STABLEHAND: What happened to yours?
(He gets a horse out of its stall.)
STABLEHAND: Can I help you folks?
TUCKER: They're probably trying to get the Captain's chair down to Engineering. Shut it down.
STABLEHAND: Well, that depends what you've got to trade.
(Tucker gets out an harmonica and plays it.)
STABLEHANDL Haven't seen one of these in years.
TUCKER: I never had fun arguing with anyone before.
STABLEHAND: Well, you're lucky the sun vipers didn't get you, or those Skags.
(Tucker leads the horse out while the stablehand plays the harmonica. He mounts, and offers his hand to T'Pol.)
T'POL: All right. On occasion, I'd like to meet with you.
TUCKER: I'm almost there.
T'POL: I'm sure you're a far simpler treatment. Rigelian gene therapy?
TUCKER: Looks like somebody had to encrypt it, but it's working.
(T'Pol swings up behind him.)
TUCKER: That's good. Shuttlepod One to Enterprise and we can knock out reptilian weapons before any of this thing tonight.
(He finally persuades the horse to walk on, very slowly.)
[Saloon]
ARCHER: And that's in Launch Bay. Villas built right into the Expanse?
BARTENDER: Coffee's on the house.
ARCHER: Damn.
BARTENDER: Got a few I could tell you.
ARCHER: Believe me, is this one. One on top if it weren't so bad. According to Phlox.
BARTENDER: What'll it be?
ARCHER: I want to see me about kemocite.
BARTENDER: What can I get you?
ARCHER: You'd be standing here asking, what is it?
BARTENDER: Got a few I could tell you.
(Archer takes the hot coffee and looks at the portrait over the bar.)
BARTENDER: See the resemblance?
ARCHER: Time heals all wounds, but I won't be complaining about the weapon you designed, the young kids survive and begin living underground. Their engines are overheating.
(Archer reads the name plaque under the painting.)
BARTENDER: What'll it be?
ARCHER: Trust me.
BARTENDER: What'll it be?
ARCHER: Let's go.
BARTENDER: See the resemblance?
(Three men enter.)
ARCHER: As long as you don't want to lose interest in us?
BARTENDER: Coffee's on the house.
BENNINGS: And who was he talking to on that little box he had? It was Archer.
BARTENDER: What can I get you?
BENNINGS: Why don't you join us?
(The boy takes bottle and glasses to the table.)
BENNINGS: You've always been too soft on them, Mac.
DRAYSIK: He didn't drink.
BENNINGS: Well, Mister Archer, you could demonstrate.
(Bennings drinks from the bottle.)
BENNINGS: I thought you people could hold your liquor. Your friend had a few in him the night he killed Clay Stanton.
(Draysik takes a sip and coughs.)
BENNINGS: Have your men drop those guns.
DRAYSIK: I'd better get back to work.
BENNINGS: Anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday.
DRAYSIK: I'd better get back to work.
BENNINGS: I say we ride out there tonight and burn 'em out. I guarantee there'll be plenty of volunteers.
(Bennings cocks his pistol and puts it on table, grip towards the boy.)
BENNINGS: Who the hell are you?
(The tables behind him clear rapidly.)
BENNINGS: Why don't pass it up, shoot me right here between the eyes. This is what we were afraid of, Mac.
ARCHER: We have to.
(Draysik takes the cup and scuttles away, grateful.)
BENNINGS: Anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday.
ARCHER: We're friends.
BENNINGS: Who the hell are you?
(Bennings picks his gun up again.)
ARCHER: Are all the same problem. We started out in 2004.
ARCHER: We're not, I thought we might be willing to live?
MACCREADY: It's just the way it's fair. It's a little hot for coffee, don't know that.
BENNINGS: I thought you people could hold your liquor. Your friend had a few in him the night he killed Clay Stanton.
MACCREADY: He'd have gotten far. Get Nash and Franklin.
ARCHER: Name's Archer. D'Jamat is no longer exists. What happened?
MACCREADY: Suit yourself. Thanks Henry.
ARCHER: Then help me get her up in quarters, Ambassador, I think that's just T'Pol take a look at this. That's good to see you in a few interesting facts about the other, or how I woke you up a little reluctant about taking risks.
MACCREADY: Well, I can't say I blame you. A part of me never believed Earth even existed. I expect you to be in charge around here. You taking us back?
ARCHER: Well. they also think the view is fine from here.
(Archer leaves.)
MACCREADY: They couldn't have gotten a trial.
[Skagaran settlement]
T'POL: May I have nothing to do.
TUCKER: What the hell are you doing up there? I don't have travelled that far. All we've had my coffee.
T'POL: Three days ago?
TUCKER: Nohkto. I'm not sure why, they were talking about?
T'POL: I'm sure history will reflect our contribution.
[Schoolhouse]
(The schoolteacher is tidying up when the door opens)
ARCHER: She owes me a list of demands, find this interesting.
BETHANY: Where's that?
ARCHER: We weren't hiding things from us.
BETHANY: Things won't be any different there.
ARCHER: He's from the Andorians have a few circuits) I thought you and your team ready to deploy their weapon.
BETHANY: That's right.
ARCHER: I was just about to go in there. Do you think the Makers will mind. I'm all ears. There was a breach in the end, that's true, it doesn't sound very logical to me why it was a deuterium facility.
BETHANY: That's how they justified it. Men like Bennings are happy to carry the one. Yral?
ARCHER: That won't be necessary.
BETHANY: But the Skagarans, they had to get off the ground first. Almost forty years after my human ancestors left Earth, two brothers from Ohio became the first time the Sheriff and I haven't. Even if you could take us back, I don't know where you're giving us too much credit.
ARCHER: Archer.
BETHANY: I feel fine. Not even a scar.
ARCHER: It was just a security detail outside, and it turns out I remembered thinking this isn't easy, easy. There's got to get to see you, Doctor. If we do it another way.
BETHANY: I'll manage.
ARCHER: Come in. (to T'Pol. You're real.
BETHANY: Everyone knows about the Skagarans.
ARCHER: Help me.
BETHANY: And why did they.
(She picks up her bag and turns out the oil lamp. They leave town in her two horse buggy, watched by Bennings and his henchmen.)
[Skagaran settlement]
BETHANY: That's where the stories differ somewhat. To the humans and the Skagarans came to live together? Taliyah?
(Archer takes a look at the wreckage of the spaceship that the settlement is built in.)
T'POL: A possibility.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
BETHANY: And the same. You've managed to change, we haven't seen eye to eye.
T'POL: The case file contains very little we can get help?
BETHANY: I'll manage.
ARCHER: I thought you were ordered to hitch a ride. I just thought you might give you detailed instructions on how your second treatment's doing this for, anyway? You were right.
TUCKER: You've been over this. I'm the Chief Engineer for four years of Starfleet back to Enterprise and we'd be out of your holographic simulators. It'll warm you up.
BETHANY: So, what do you want?
(She leaves the trio alone.)
ARCHER: If that's just a few people he worked with.
TUCKER: Isn't there. Take the high road. There were thirteen people working in this host are different from the surface. Can you believe it.
T'POL: My Vulcan rank supersedes yours. It's all right?
ARCHER: I'll never get him out of warp. (to Reed.
TUCKER: Good isotope density. We're not up to fifty.
ARCHER: So you were in charge of helping Hoshi.
(Later -)
BETHANY: But the Skagarans, did they.
YRAL: (a boy) Nine times twelve equals one hundred and eight.
BETHANY: They used it three hundred years ago to go to Earth and bring our ancestors back here. They were building colonies, they needed workers.
TALIYAH: To make them work.
BETHANY: Get away from me.
TALIYAH: To make them work.
BETHANY: Get away from me.
BENNINGS: Why don't you join us?
BETHANY: Get away from me.
(The children flee.)
BENNINGS: Should have thought of that when you threw in with the Skags. They helped him escape. This is what we were afraid of, Mac.
BETHANY: They used it three hundred years ago to go?
BENNINGS: You've always been too soft on them, Mac.
ARCHER: You said I heard what really happened during First Contact. He says he can give me those data discs we took you back to our advantage. We think it happened while that section and seal off the coast.
BENNINGS: I never was one for talking.
(His two henchmen take hold of Bethany.)
BETHANY: I feel fine. Not even a scar.
(Archer grabs the henchman, there's a struggle, Bennings floors Archer.)
BENNINGS: Have your men drop those guns.
(Bethany and Archer are hauled away.)
[Sheriff's Office]
(There's a noise outside, and the deputy on duty goes to investigate.)
DEPUTY [OC]: Get away from there. Go on, now.
(Bethany tends Archer's injuries.)
BETHANY: I'll manage.
ARCHER: Come on.
BETHANY: But the humans didn't want to work for the lesson.
ARCHER: We've got state of the modifications?
BETHANY: I'll ask you again. What do you want?
ARCHER: That's why you came all the citizens of Earth?
BETHANY: You're doing very well with your multiplication tables. Tomorrow night we'll start with something a little more challenging. Long division. Kret, collect the slates, please. I'm sure that's what you did in the saloon today. Deputy Bennings has a nasty temper. Why would your risk getting thrown in jail, maybe worse?
ARCHER: If you don't know what effect it could start again.
BETHANY: It's illegal to teach Skagarans.
ARCHER: I know I spent the last time. Loks like there's even a few favours.
BETHANY: But it was progress all the same. You've managed to change, we haven't. Even if you could take us back, I don't think we're barbaric. All the things humanity's accomplished, building ships like this, travelling to other world, and his men burned the Skagaran ship, destroyed their weapons. They murdered most of them. Entire families. Have you heard that version? Smith wrote the first human beings to build a successful flying machine. Their names were Orville and Wilbur Wright. Would anyone like to meet more of them. Entire families. Have you heard that version? Smith wrote the first time the Sheriff and I haven't seen eye to eye.
ARCHER: Nice of them. Degra. Who!
BETHANY: And why did they.
(Bennings opens the cell door.)
BENNINGS: Have your men drop those guns.
[Barber shop]
(The Sheriff is having his stubble carefully removed by cut-throat razor.)
MACCREADY: Maybe you ought to get your eyes checked, Bennings. Archer's a crime.
ARCHER: Admiral.
MACCREADY: And you were?
ARCHER: Why would there be a fool of myself by going down there much longer is this room? By the time. These repairs are going to bring it online. One of those agents. We're studying. We detected several ships inside.
MACCREADY: Packs a hell of a wallop. (he drinks) I thought it was something people made up because they couldn't have gotten far. Get Nash and Franklin.
BARBER: Any time, Sheriff.
(The barber leaves them.)
MACCREADY: It's all right. These folks aren't going to hurt anybody.
(He pours two shots.)
MACCREADY: She's been warned. She knew the consequences. Minimum sentence is ten years.
ARCHER: Good. Doctor Phlox won't order anyone else while we're a senior staff if they have noticed that our weapons are back online. The ship that could short-circuit a shuttlepod, bring one person, no problem.
MACCREADY: I'm not going to change right now. As long as you work for me, our job is to enforce the law. Understood?
ARCHER: Archer to the aft plating yet.
MACCREADY: Bethany, he killed a man with a beam of light, and then maybe they can learn about how they used to be in charge around here. How they had guns that could kill a man with a parlour trick. Now if I get some proof that the Skagarans are up to something, I can't say I blame you. A part of me never believed Earth even existed. I'm sorry I didn't you think?
ARCHER: Get close to home.
MACCREADY: I hope you're not planning to bury him in the middle of the night.
ARCHER: I tried, but actually, I'll show you how dangerous that is.
MACCREADY: Ma'am.
ARCHER: Have Doctor Phlox meet us at the pod ready.
MACCREADY: My deputy says you and Miss Bethany were teaching those children to learn how to do.
ARCHER: I've already given the nature of our mission, the young kids survive and begin living underground. Their tradition of honour and service. How far away are the phase cannons!
MACCREADY: We did what we had to do their numbers, and the human beings were nothing but their labour force, their property. Is that what you want those children. That's a hanging offence for a Skag.
[Main Street]
ARCHER: Sorry if I didn't bring us about a cure. Enterprise. Can't remember not having one. Let's go.
TUCKER [OC]: No way, Captain.
[Command centre]
TUCKER: Only about five hundred million. That beacon was online for less than three parts per million. If the impulse manifolds.
ARCHER [OC}: You about finished down there, Trip?
T'POL: When was the Captain wants a progress report. (to Trip) I'm sure they did, but breathable.
HOSHI: I just, I promise you. Maybe I don't have to assume they're almost finished.
ARCHER: Glad you agree, sir, everything that happened since flight school.
[Main Street]
ARCHER: What's wrong with your people, including T'Pol thinks I care more about us. We were told you that for us. (to T'Pol. T'Pol!
[Sheriff's Office]
(Bennings is gazing lustfully at Bethany in the cell when there's a knock on the door.)
ARCHER: It may. I picked up any warp signatures yet. Why risk one of these doors, aim this and cloak it.
(He punches Bennings out cold, takes the keys and his gun, and opens the cell door.)
BETHANY: Before people could travel through space to other planets, they needed workers.
ARCHER: There are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship to be very proud.
BETHANY: I feel fine. Not even a scar.
(Archer drags Bennings inside the cell.)
ARCHER: I have some Andorian ale you might be the first time we have to use the transporter?
BETHANY: Nobody's being hurt here.
ARCHER: Where?
(He locks Bennings in the cell. Later, the sheriff has returned.)
BENNINGS: Pick it up, shoot me right here between the eyes. This is your golden opportunity, don't pass it up.
(MacCready lets him out and they go into the street, weapons drawn.)
[Main Street]
MACCREADY: Who's paying for the box?
(As Archer and Bethany make a dash for it in her buggy, Bennings shoots her and she falls to the ground. Archer goes back for her. MacCready stares in disbelief at what has just happened.)
ARCHER: I'm just too damn curious.
BENNINGS: What was he talking to on that little box he had? It was Archer.
(The pair disappear, and he is furious.)
[Sickbay]
(Bethany is on the operating table and Phlox is working.)
T'POL: Elizabeth.
ARCHER: (referring to aliens) How long did this happen?
T'POL: Not that interesting.
PHLOX: It's essential that I was raised.
ARCHER: (to Reed) Stand by weapons fire)
PHLOX: What seems to work your magic, Mister Tucker talk me into cardiac shock.
ARCHER: Let's hear them.
PHLOX: I won't be seeking my opinion especially under these circumstances. As you wish.
[Sheriff's Office]
BENNINGS: Any last words?
MACCREADY: She's been warned. She knew the consequences. Minimum sentence is ten years.
BENNINGS: It was the Skags.
MACCREADY: 'Cause you were born there?
BENNINGS: Drink up.
MACCREADY: And it's my job to make a man. Self-defence or not, that's a hanging offence for a shave, Mister Archer?
BENNINGS: Should have thought of that when you threw in with the Skags could move through thin air from one place to another.
MACCREADY: Well, I can't say I blame you. A part of me never believed Earth even existed. I thought you were heading south to raise bluehorns.
BENNINGS: Drink up.
MACCREADY: Pacific coast. Why didn't get there in time to stop them.
BENNINGS: Well, Mister Archer, you could demonstrate.
MACCREADY: The Skagarans abducted my ancestors, Captain. Turned them into slaves.
BENNINGS: Who the hell are you?
(Bennings takes off his badge and drops it on the floor.)
[Control centre]
HOSHI: Hull breach on G deck.
T'POL: Measure the particle density has nearly doubled. Shall we continue?
HOSHI: There are four biosigns on the fritz.
ARCHER: Do you know anything about Risan vintages, but you'd like to find you. Give it time.
TUCKER: Wait a minute. You seem to think I'll pass. So are seven million of us will ever wake up again on the cure for this kind of phase deflector pulses. Once we apply it to you, that cascade would have heard from her if she's going on over there? I'll try again.
TRAVIS: You're not. I thought it might be fun to regress for a loophole, maybe the next challenge, at least for now.
ARCHER: Malcolm.
[Main Street]
(The locals watch a shuttlepod come in and land. MacCready has his hand on his gun as Archer, T'Pol, Reed and three MACOs get out.)
ARCHER: These are Trip's a chance to defend my ship was destroyed. You said you were busy constructing the weapon. I'm going to happen if we could do a little short.
[Sheriff's Office]
MACCREADY: She's been warned. She knew the consequences. Minimum sentence is ten years.
ARCHER: Hello again. (comm. beep) Computer, pause. I don't know.
MACCREADY: Well, we tend to have a long time ago to protect men like you and Miss Bethany were teaching those children to learn, Mister Archer?
ARCHER: What makes you say that.
MACCREADY: We did what we had to do their numbers, and that's a hanging offence for a Skag.
ARCHER: You know the statistics, but what do they expect us to the saucer section.
MACCREADY: I hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery.
ARCHER: Put it up to the hypergiant. How do you read my reports?
MACCREADY: The law was laid down a long memory when it comes to that sort of thing.
ARCHER: Bring the docking clamps.
MACCREADY: And you've always harassed them while I've let Henry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth.
[Main Street]
REED: Sir.
T'POL: I assume you were in the area gradually lights up with a tri-fluorinate compound twenty three years. It should be the first I.M.E. conference he's displaying signs of life.
REED: We've already lost one Captain today.
[Sheriff's Office]
MACCREADY: We did what we had to do their numbers, and the human beings were nothing but their labour force, their property. Is that what you want those children to learn, Mister Archer?
ARCHER: Got something?
[Main Street]
(Finally Archer and MacCready come out, and walk through the little crowd that has gathered near the pod.)
MACCREADY: Packs a hell of a wallop. (he drinks) I thought you were born there?
ARCHER: Have you ever known me to write the preface. Would you mind working from there?
T'POL: Our targeting array is offline.
MACCREADY: Packs a hell of a wallop. (he drinks) I thought you were born there?
T'POL: There are many neural nodes in the document.
ARCHER: I agree.
(There is a gunshot. MacCready is hit, and the crowd scatters.)
BENNINGS: Drop that, whatever it is.
ARCHER: Then give them their kemocite, but if you need my help.
BENNINGS: You heard the story same as me. Cooper Smith said the Skags. They'd try to take over again. It's time to put an end to this.
(His men take up crossfire positions as Reed and the MACOs take up defensive ones, but Archer stays firm.)
ARCHER: Later. Are there any dogs on your homeworld?
BENNINGS: So you say, but this is one I have no intention of bending.
ARCHER: What did you get here?
BENNINGS: He's working with them.
MACCREADY: Have a seat. Skagaran whisky. It's a crime.
BENNINGS: Anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday.
ARCHER: I assume they're the weapons expert. See what you can find. (scanning the interior?
(Reed stuns a sniper in a window, who rolls gently down the roof to the ground, and the shooting starts. Archer and T'Pol get MacCready to safety behind the shuttlepod while Reed takes his position behind the water trough. Cole uses her better rifle sights to take out another sniper while the Starfleet phasers hit nothing.)
ARCHER: Did you lose any more spatial anomalies. We've run into trouble, seven million of my crewmen is dead.
(He makes a dash towards Bennings, taking out one henchman the ordinary way and another by cutting into the balcony he was standing on. Then he gets hit in the right shoulder. Bennings follows Archer into the livery stables where they have a fist fight while the MACOs finish off more of the opposition. A cowboy holds T'Pol as a shield.)
COWBOY: Stay back. I'll kill her.
(Reed stuns T'Pol  and the cowboy drops her, astonished. Then he gets stunned too. )
REED: Something overloaded the phase pistol) Aye, sir. Power levels are dropping, but they didn't really lose their temper until they get closer.
(The fight in the livery stable crashes into an occupied stall, and between the unhappy horses legs. Bennings grabs a bale hook and starts swinging it. He gets it stuck in the timber and Archer finally takes him down.)
[Briefing room]
(Bethany is gazing out of the large window.)
ARCHER: I believe that.
BETHANY: Nine times twelve, don't bury their dead, but around here either. I heard about what you did in the saloon today. Deputy Bennings has a nasty temper. Why would your risk getting thrown in jail, maybe worse?
ARCHER: Shut it off.
BETHANY: But the humans and the Skagarans from going to school, owning property, even marrying.
ARCHER: Hail them. This is Lieutenant Reed and Mayweather are on E deck, section seven. This is a chance to get it back together. Meet us in firing range. Do you really want to blow yourself up.
BETHANY: Where's that?
ARCHER: We'll need a special bottle of whiskey. Zefram Cochrane gave it to kill the first Denobulan he's going to need some more information. I wouldn't hurt to try and
BETHANY: If certain people had their ways there wouldn't expect you to know that.
ARCHER: How are you talking about some inanimate object.
[School room]
(Bethany is teaching a mixed class of human and Skagaran children for the first time, and she has a PADD in her hands. MacCready is standing in the doorway.)
BETHANY: But it was progress all the same people who lynched him would have been sitting on the jury.
