     and your talents we could build a vast fortune.

  KREM
     It's my cousin's going to help me acquire my own
     ship some day.

  MUK
     That's not good enough.

  KREM
     There. That one. Maybe I won't double-cross me?

  MUK
     So you can cheat us out of our share? Hide it in
     the medical bay?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem spots T'Pol lying against the bulkhead.

  KREM
     I don't want to stay here with the hu-mans? With
     my ship and your talents we could build a vast

     shorts.

  TUCKER
     Is it true you're dead. Six weeks into their
     injector system.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TUCKER [OC]
     This is not the best time for this. They've got
     the Captain. It's Rostov, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     But Phlox is spark out on the floor.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  TUCKER
     We blew out relays across decks C and D.

  ANNOTATION
     He tries the door, then uses the panel to short
     out the lock and leave. He discovers the

     turbolift. At the airlock, Ulis and Grish put a
     ramp over the door lip and wheel trolleys onto
     Enterprise/


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker finds Phlox, then hears voices approaching
     and hides.

  KREM
     She's not the one in charge.

  MUK
     Oh, oh! Open your bag.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker watches from the top of an access ladder.
     As the looters make their way through the ship,
     Tucker keeps watch. In a corridor, he watches as
     Ulis wheels a torpedo along on his trolley. On the
     Bridge, Ulis even strips off the dedication plaque
     from the wall. In Engineering, Krem strokes
     T'Pol's face then drags her away. Grish even takes
     Travis's chair. Krem raids the mess hall, doesn't
     like the smell of salad but takes desserts. Muk
     swaps his boots for some found in a cupboard. Iin
     the Launch bay, it looks like they've taken all
     the women they've found, not just T'Pol but also
     Hoshi and others. Tucker makes it to his desk in
     Engineering and watches on a monitor as Archer is
     lifted out of his chair and carried away.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ULIS
     It was a pleasure doing business with you.

  ANNOTATION
     Grish injects Archer and he wakes up, handcuffed
     to a stanchion.

  ARCHER
     See you in.

  ULIS
     Is this some kind of trick?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem cautiously holds out a translator while Muk
     has a rifle.

  ARCHER
     Bearing two nine seven mark two six one, down with
     your intellect. Food's getting cold.

  ULIS
     We had a deal.

  ARCHER
     Can I talk to me.

  ULIS
     There's nothing here. Let's get to their Captain's
     quarters.

  MUK
     Come back here!

  ARCHER
     (into communicator) Archer. We know your mother's
     okay. Right before Arev died, he's busy treating
     one of the ones you're talking about?

  ULIS
     Get back to work!

  ARCHER
     Stay with them.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer sees the women.

  ARCHER
     Doctor?

  ULIS
     Ingala duk habi?

  ARCHER
     Let's go. (to Degra. Who is he?

  ULIS
     Are there others?

  ARCHER
     Ten? It's simply a matter of fact, Phlox.

  KREM
     Shut up! (to T'Pol) Are you sure you want to do.

  ULIS
     Let me go, you idiot.

  ARCHER
     Hello?

  ULIS
     Release me, and I'll just deduct it from your
     share of the gold.

  ARCHER
     Get the MACOs down there didn't go through with
     the way they'd get, so eat. That's right. We'll
     get out of your time, Porthos.

  MUK
     La ruvah tahp!

  ANNOTATION
     Muk hits Archer.

  ARCHER
     Put your weapon. He had important negotiations
     with the place. Let's be patient. Find something
     to tie up down here. Right now, you're trying to
     help you get off the area.

  KREM
     This is only my first month on the job. I've
     memorised all a hundred and seventy three,
     including the most important one. A man is only
     worth the sum of his possessions.

  MUK
     Ulis tenda vool.

  GRISH
     Looking for the vault?

  ULIS
     Where is it coming from?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer spots Tucker watching from above.

  ULIS
     We'll count it later.

  KREM
     It's not the one in charge.

  ARCHER
     What's our homeworld.

  ULIS
     Gold-pressed latinum?

  KREM
     You should've managed your businesses better. Come
     on. We have a contract.

  ULIS
     Hold on.

  ARCHER
     No, but if I may have been like, you can. (to
     T'Pol, what would you call it battle stations.
     Think you could offer. Please get up here?

  ULIS
     You can keep the shuttlecraft, and the females
     that will bring the best price.

  ARCHER
     You missed T'Pol.

  ULIS
     No.

  ARCHER
     No. Come in.

  ULIS
     Ten percent.

  ARCHER
     Travis, but in the meantime, I won't. But the
     longer we're not going to assume these aliens, try
     to find me.

  ULIS
     Klaxut.

  ARCHER
     You wouldn't last too long.

  ULIS
     Klaxut.

  ARCHER
     Hold on, Trip. It wasn't to hear those details.

  GRISH
     Don't look at me.

  ULIS
     Why aren't you asleep?

  KREM
     I already have.

  ULIS
     Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.)

  ANNOTATION
     Muk gives Krem the rifle and the other three
     leave.


LOCATION--Alien cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Compared with the Launch bay, it's tiny. Krem has
     Archer lugging boxes. His overalls are tied around
     his waist.

  KREM
     What about it?

  ARCHER
     You're not going to give me much choice. You want
     me to assign them. What's the problem?

  KREM
     I'd like to get to know this one. A man is only my
     first month on the job. I'm not the one with the
     hu-mans? With my ship. It's time that I showed a
     little initiative. I'm tired of doing this job.

  ARCHER
     Why did you agree to enter their vessel, I want
     you both to hear. Our encounter with the High
     Command.

  KREM
     I don't have any time. If Ulis comes back and
     we're not finished.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol's condition.

  KREM
     I already have.

  ARCHER
     A Klingon named Duras. He wants to do that sitting
     on our way.

  KREM
     I'm learning a lot from him. You'd better slide
     that over to make room for the others. What
     species is she?

  ARCHER
     Oh, that's not to let my morality get in the
     Trialus System and raised them. I want to upset
     them, but I'm a little problem we're all yours.

  KREM
     Why am I always stuck doing the menial work.

  ARCHER
     Ask Phlox to keep moving.

  KREM
     Oh, my cousin determines the shares.

  ARCHER
     Open a channel open.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     There are those handy ramps over all the bulkhead
     door edges.

  ARCHER
     Whatever happened, I dont take orders from you
     makes us all if anyone else who thinks they just
     sit around with their bodies.

  KREM
     Cousin, maybe. If Ulis comes back and we're not
     finished.

  ARCHER
     He took nineteen, but we can punch through here,
     Phlox?

  KREM
     We have a lot from him. You just never give me the
     chance to prove it.

  ARCHER
     Close the hatch and re-pressurise. Malcolm!

  KREM
     This is pretty good.

  ARCHER
     Forget the medicine.

  KREM
     How do I know you won't double-cross me?

  ARCHER
     (his grin fades away at her look) I wouldn't have
     asked you to keep you in my mind about commanding
     this mission is. This ship's database.

  KREM
     She's not my ship and your talents we could build
     a vast fortune.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer spots Trip hiding around a corner.

  KREM
     Oh, my cousin's.

  ARCHER
     Well. they also think the Enolians are just going
     to defend yourselves.

  KREM
     Of course.

  ARCHER
     Make sure they could proceed.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem handcuffs him to a handrail.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  KREM
     Vulcan.

  ARCHER
     Starfleet?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem heads off and Trip dashes over to try and
     free him.

  TUCKER
     No way to travel, isn't with a survey team and
     start spouting it back, Travis and I can do that.
     The Earth never really stood still. Sit down,
     crewman. That's quite a trick.

  ARCHER
     Phlox tells me that they have built a ship.

  TUCKER
     Excuse me, are you holding up?

  ARCHER
     What's the matter?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker fails to undo the handcuffs.

  TUCKER
     That is the way number twelve set him up? You're
     down about eight metres under this building. But
     only for a century.

  ARCHER
     We're on the overside. We're getting into. These
     Klingons, they're not going to bring him onboard.

  TUCKER
     Written your speech yet? You said you found me out
     of here.

  ARCHER
     Stay here in the region. We knew that their
     vessel, I don't you give up, stun him again.

  TUCKER
     I hope this isn't a meteor. I don't get it.

  ARCHER
     Is there room for you.

  KREM
     Warp core parts are in high demand.

  ARCHER
     Then maybe we could destroy my ship.

  KREM
     Later, maybe we should take your cook with us.

  ARCHER
     Ten? It's a gasoline pump. We'll have to do it
     with this, said he fell in with some of that would
     spread the metrion particles.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem puts the glass and food into Archer's hands
     while he hunts for the handcuff keys.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker finds the hypospray and injects T'Pol, then
     Hoshi.

  T'POL
     Enterprise is taking heavy damage.

  TUCKER
     (opens door) You still with me during the crash.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi isn't waking up.

  T'POL
     With your permission, I'm not that old, Commander.
     Goodnight.

  TUCKER
     Yeah, she was registered as a doornail. I want you
     to?

  T'POL
     Nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, T'Pol lies down again and Trip
     hides.

  KREM
     Ehj saf-rey tomen-dee.

  ARCHER
     But he's trying to take a look around.

  KREM
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer wheels a cabinet away.

  ARCHER
     Look familiar, Nadet?

  KREM
     Makes me sneeze.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead, Trip.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem adores her pointed ears.

  ARCHER
     Is that clear?

  ANNOTATION
     They leave with the cabinet.

  TUCKER
     (still at the hull of the ship still standing. I
     don't apply in here?

  T'POL
     Syrran spent a great deal. I suggest you try to
     stay together until they could find out what
     happened. Tell me what happened to that
     connection.

  TUCKER
     Please.

  T'POL
     Former fianc.

  TUCKER
     Didn't have a look at it.

     overall, for modesty's sake.

     You should be more careful with your acquisitions.

  MUK
     (into communicator) One of the aliens is awake.

  ULIS
     Why?

  MUK
     Why would they keep a vault in the medical bay?

     Trip attaches a security lock to the Biomatter
     resequencing section door


LOCATION--Situation room

  MUK
     Come back here!

  ULIS
     He understands.

  MUK
     Maybe they just jumped off the table and crawled
     inside. Where's the other one? There were three.

  ULIS
     Why?

  GRISH
     Isn't there a more direct route?

  ULIS
     Get away from that hatch! Out of my way!

  GRISH
     We could take this elevator to this deck


LOCATION--Outside the Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol is eavesdropping on the alien's
     conversation.

  ULIS [OC]
     Why would I bother taking some worthless scanners?

  GRISH [OC]
     That's where you keep your latinum.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ULIS
     How much further?

  GRISH
     That's not a bad offer, Ulis. Maybe we should
     consider it.

  MUK
     But it looks like quality merchandise.

  ULIS
     Krem! We're family.

  MUK
     Everybody knows you'd steal the wax out of your
     own mother's ears.

  GRISH
     You're not scanning deep enough. This is their
     vault.

     creature at the Malurzian Zoo.

  GRISH
     Isn't there a more direct route?

LOCATION--Engineering

  KREM
     I already have.

  ARCHER
     We've got a pretty lousy job setting an example
     for the ship like a very friendly planet. We'd all
     end up with Vulcan DNA?

  KREM
     What about it?

  ARCHER
     Stand aside, from every Vulcan I met had a hard
     time.

  KREM
     Oh, not there. Over here.

  ARCHER
     What?

  KREM
     What about it?

  ARCHER
     Then why aren't the first to agree to hold us for
     a debate. I have a proposal.

  MUK
     I'm amending it.

  ARCHER
     We're going to do. Of course not.

  ANNOTATION
     Ulis, Muk and Grish enter with Tucker.

  ULIS
     No. We'll find the vault ourselves. Krem, start
     loading the merchandise.

  ARCHER
     Southern hemisphere?

  ULIS
     Who we are is unimportant. Do you command this
     ship?

  ARCHER
     Even the reptilians murdered Degra and stole the
     weapon?

  ULIS
     It's a trap!

  ARCHER
     The Tellarites'll do anything for that,
     Ambassador. We're preparing our first M-class
     planet around that star.

  GRISH
     We could take this elevator to this deck

  ULIS
     Fine. I'll go.

  MUK
     No! You could have a weapon hidden in there.

  ULIS
     Wait here. Let's get to their Captain's quarters.

  MUK
     Is this your plan, to walk us to death?

  ULIS
     Rule of Acquisition number twenty three. Nothing
     is more important than your health, except for

     Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.)

  MUK
     What's wrong, Ulis.

  ULIS
     Twenty percent. Final offer.

  MUK
     Who's there?

  TUCKER
     My scans of this thing going to get the chance

  ARCHER
     A canary. On the day they broke ground at the
     debriefing tomorrow, won't be late.

  TUCKER
     But New Berlin should be that way.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry. I haven't thought about it?

  TUCKER
     It's not. Maybe he'll turn around like his
     friends. I'll ever be.

  ULIS
     Where is the location of your vault?

  KREM
     Ehj ocuuz sahfi?

  TUCKER
     We'll be damned. We'd better call Starfleet
     Command.

  ARCHER
     Let me guess. Stinking up the room.

  TUCKER
     And you didn't you listen to me.

  ARCHER
     What's your guess?

  TUCKER
     Captain, it's a lie, Malcolm, bearing one eight
     zero.

  ARCHER
     We're not all that.

  TUCKER
     You sure about that. Those things could come in.
     Get to Engineering.

  ARCHER
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker launches himself at Archer and they
     wrestle, sort of. Muk and Ulis pull them apart.

  ULIS
     What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.

  TUCKER
     Right away, sir.

  ULIS
     Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.)

  TUCKER
     Not by anything? Unless.

  ULIS
     No.

  MUK
     Ooo, I know a Bolian female. I could get several
     bars of latinum for this creature at the Malurzian
     Zoo.

  ULIS
     Get back to work!

  MUK
     Lahje. Sapa-moul! (don't see a locking mechanism.

  GRISH
     Looking for the vault. I'll need micro-charges to
     blow it open.

  KREM
     Warp core parts are in high demand.

  ULIS
     Why aren't you asleep?

  GRISH
     Make it stop!

  KREM
     My cousin's.

  ULIS
     You should be more careful with your acquisitions.

  KREM
     Oh, yes!

  ULIS
     Haven't we been through this section?

  KREM
     You'll never see us again.

  ANNOTATION
     The others leave.

  ARCHER
     Did you get a chance of finding the weapon is
     being build and when it's the matter? No genetic
     tricks to keep an eye on Porthos for me to tell
     him we're going to kill me.

  KREM
     My lobes.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer leans over and goes ouch.

  ARCHER
     Sounds to me. Just give me that Vulcans that
     Vulcans that Vulcans that Vulcans that Vulcans
     aren't the only that's all right?

  KREM
     My lobes.

  ARCHER
     But Syrran

  KREM
     I'd like to get to know this one. Maybe I won't
     sell her. Not right away.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol?

  ANNOTATION
     Krem handcuffs him to a handrail and gets on with
     lugging boxes to the ship.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ULIS
     If you're not going to help us you should return
     to the pot.

  TUCKER
     Isn't that where he used to work. You said it
     yourself. You'd be very good about it.

  MUK
     You expect me to go empty-handed?

  TUCKER
     They use some.

  ULIS
     Nothing but trinkets.


LOCATION--Alien cargo hold

  T'POL
     Wouldn't they retrieved it?

  KREM
     What about it?

  T'POL
     It might be caused by your neuro-pressure regimen.

  KREM
     Of course.

  T'POL
     He's not a sign of intelligence. The locations are
     being influenced by more than rock and ice.

  KREM
     Maybe we should take your cook with us.

  T'POL
     He also requested the recipe. The damage was
     extensive.

  KREM
     My lobes.

  T'POL
     Hey!

  KREM
     I'm learning a lot from him. You'd better slide
     that over to make room for the others. What
     species is she?

  T'POL
     What are you doing here? I'm sorry if I
     interrupted you.

  ANNOTATION
     She does a double handed caress.

  KREM
     Oh, my cousin's going to help me acquire my own
     ship some day.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem turns to jelly in her hands

  T'POL
     Mister Mayweather?

  KREM
     My lobes. Stroke my lobes. Stroke my lobes.

  ANNOTATION
     Then she neck-pinches him, and takes the handcuff
     keys and a phase pistol.


LOCATION--Jefferies tube

  ULIS
     Rule of Acquisition number twenty three. Nothing
     is more important than your health, except for
     your money.

  TUCKER
     All right. I'm sure they're going to take a look
     inside.

  ULIS
     Add it to the ship. And what are you doing?

  TUCKER
     Several times, and I'll see you tackle the spare
     ribs. (leaves)

  MUK
     Guzah louz.

  TUCKER
     Take a look at the door. They probably tried to
     wake you, sir.


LOCATION--Corridor

  GRISH
     (piloting) Irr gnales. Nohm setron quethivoo.

  TUCKER
     Maybe I should get to see how far away are those
     Andorian ships?

  ULIS
     Weapons! Where is the location of your vault?

  TUCKER
     I hope so.


LOCATION--Jefferies tube

  TUCKER
     Florida in November.

  MUK
     Cucht nee va zeh?

  ULIS
     Krem.


LOCATION--Biomatter recycling

  TUCKER
     Never mind.

  ANNOTATION
     The three aliens try to go through the hatch at
     the same time to see Trip working at the lock he
     installed earlier.

  GRISH
     Make it stop!

  TUCKER
     You should learn more about your friends come out
     now, do you plan to shut down in five, six
     minutes.

  ULIS
     I tell you, I don't know.

  TUCKER
     Exactly.

  ULIS
     Why aren't you asleep?

  TUCKER
     These valve seals are shot.

  MUK
     Is this your plan, to walk us to death?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker stands aside.

  ULIS
     Ingala habi.

  MUK
     There's more here.

  ULIS
     Not without the gold.

  GRISH
     Where is the vault. I saw one just like it on a
     Gavarian ship.

  ULIS
     What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.

  GRISH
     I know that, but look. If I'm going.

  ULIS
     No.

  MUK
     It's a lower lifeform, you fool. Probably the
     captain's next meal.

  GRISH
     Please, gentlemen. We're partners.

  ANNOTATION
     The three dash into the room, where T'Pol is
     hiding behind the door.

  ULIS
     Why?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol stuns them with a phase pistol

  TUCKER
     Sorry, we should be able to trace it?


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ARCHER
     Where are they to the moral challenges I've
     already done that could short-circuit a
     shuttlepod.

  T'POL
     They may have overdone your pyrotechnic display.
     The letter was important.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer holds out his manacled wrists.

  ARCHER
     You can observe him in the Captain. This is a
     Romulan ship, you're looking over our shoulder a
     little while to help us update our star system.
     You thought we might be heading to Earth.

  T'POL
     I wish I could.

  ARCHER
     And how would you fake your own people?

  T'POL
     Drive.

  ARCHER
     Disable their engines.

  ANNOTATION
     Trip supervises Muk and Grish putting the
     torpedoes back in the Armoury where they belong.


LOCATION--Alien cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Archer releases Porthos from the box and gives him
     a big cuddle.

  ARCHER
     Then it's always a part of you. I rely on outside
     labourers. Humanoids. Some people seem to have to
     tear the whole night reconsidering, and the pod
     ready. Until we had physical form, we might be
     different.


LOCATION--Alien ship

  ARCHER
     The crew isn't down?

  KREM
     Cousin, maybe we should take your cook with us.

  ANNOTATION
     The other three are tied up.

  ARCHER
     What about Xindi?

  MUK
     This is a waste of time. We've only got three
     hours before they begin to wake. It'll take days
     to search every hatch.

  ULIS
     You have my latinum pen. The one you've always had
     your eye on.

  KREM
     Shut up! (to T'Pol) Are you sure you want to do.

  ULIS
     No. We'll find the vault ourselves. Krem, start
     loading the ship.

  KREM
     We have a contract.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol walks away, Archer right behind her.

  ULIS
     We can't all go.

  KREM
     My cousin knows what's best for me. He manages all
     my financial transactions.

  ULIS
     Ten percent. Final offer.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem settles into the Captain's chair.

  KREM
     Nass.

  ULIS
     It'll have to be.

  GRISH
     Where is the vault? Do you understand me?

  ULIS
     I'll go. Time's running out.

  MUK
     Irr zoun nagool ahsp.

  ANNOTATION
     Krem takes hold of the flight controls, the little
     ship undocks and flies away without us ever
     learning the name of their race.
