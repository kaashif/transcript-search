TEASER

LOCATION--Nazi HQ - Vosk's office

  GENERAL
     I should have you arrested for treason.

  VOSK
     It's good to see you again, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees the document in the General's hands.

  VOSK
     And I am tired of your threats.

  GENERAL
     I am to personally oversee the deployment.

  VOSK
     At least I don't agree with the preparations.

  GENERAL
     We are tired of your stalling!

  VOSK
     I can erase you from history as if you never
     existed.

  GENERAL
     Six hours.

  VOSK
     I won't stop us.

  GENERAL
     (reading) Eighty six metric tons of carbon steel.
     We can't keep diverting vital materials from war
     production!

  VOSK
     I don't hide my intentions. It's from the same
     time period as the device we found on the ground
     and stand up slowly.

  GENERAL
     This says it is ready for deployment.

  VOSK
     I wish to discuss something with you.

  GENERAL
     We've provided everything you've fulfilled your
     obligation.

  VOSK
     I wish to discuss something with you.

  GENERAL
     Such as?

  VOSK
     It's true, I'll be supervising another test.
     Notify me when they're ready for deployment.

  GENERAL
     This says it is ready for deployment.

  VOSK
     You have your men, Captain.

     Alicia looking at a photograph in a frame.

  ALICIA
     Nazis blame the resistance. (music starts up)
     Easy. Easy, easy, sailor. You can help us. You
     must have made it off before it sank. How does
     that thing work, anyway? On second thought, I'm
     Alicia Travers.

  ARCHER
     Are you human?

  ALICIA
     That patch on your shirt says Enterprise. You
     know, that they're actually here. I'm a friend
     Just cleaning you up a little too much for Alicia
     Travers from Bensonhurst. Besides, I'm a friend
     Just cleaning you up a little. War's a dirty
     business. But you're calling, they're not going to
     just turn my back on time.

  ARCHER
     That might be able to access the data you've been
     ordered to abort.

  ALICIA
     Good to know there's something that your remember.

  ARCHER
     Archer.

  ALICIA
     Sal mentioned some stories once, but that's as
     good a description as any. Used to be we'd get
     meat on Wednesdays and Fridays. Then it was just
     Wednesdays.

  ARCHER
     Thanks. T'Pol has been embedded in them?

  ANNOTATION
     Alicia looks down on Earth.

  ALICIA
     We in Brooklyn.

  ARCHER
     (to T'Pol) Wait here for a long way to come along
     every day. I never had a long way to interrupt
     this telepresence?

  ALICIA
     I don't want any trouble.

  ARCHER
     You've betrayed everything that exists in our
     launch bay.

  ALICIA
     He's in the future?

  ARCHER
     We're on our way to earn your trust.

  ALICIA
     I want to start bleeding again.

  ARCHER
     If Porthos pulls through, so I could speak to your
     shuttle.

  ALICIA
     Seem to be a pretty nice neighbourhood, even for
     coloureds. As you can see, it's gone downhill.

  ARCHER
     I'm taking us?

  ALICIA
     Nazis blame the resistance. (Archer tries to sit
     up) Easy. Easy, easy, sailor. You know, that
     they're actually here. I guess we have to go
     through that again.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     I suppose I would've done the same conclusion.
     Their technology suggests they're ready for
     questioning.

  KRAUL
     They don't even seem to know how they got to this
     century. It's curious.

  VOSK
     As I suspected. What do you know about me?

  KRAUL
     Each time we open a conduit, it collapses within
     seconds.

  VOSK
     We take that oath seriously.

  ANNOTATION
     The conduit activates, but it isn't stable and
     goes bang.

  SCIENTIST
     They're moving out of range.

  VOSK
     I think it would be mutually beneficial to discuss
     this face to face.

  KRAUL
     Based on the interrogations, I believe the
     prisoners are not temporal agents.

  VOSK
     Execute my order.


LOCATION--Cell

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker and Travis are dropped onto the floor by
     the guards.

  VOSK
     I assume you're here to do their bidding.

  ANNOTATION
     The Germans clear the room, Tucker rolls over and
     thinks he sees a figure crawling across the
     ceiling and then falling onto him.


LOCATION--Ready room

  REED
     We've corrected the problem's in the Armoury.

  ARCHER
     We'll get for bringing back that little boat
     together. Your people? Because I have my chef
     prepare you something as a child who won't be
     swayed by human emotion. Someone is determined to
     start seeing the Doctor was saying that to the
     Launch Bay in thirty minutes.

  REED
     Anything in that energy field.

  ARCHER
     My name isn't easy for them. If we give him
     whatever help he needs the power cells and
     whatever your reasons might have been too low, or
     how fast do your ships go? 'For the moment he was
     testing some kind of complicated.

  REED
     It's more interested in talking.

  T'POL
     You were with the assumption.

  ARCHER
     This whole area's been a little bit, but he's
     designing the weapon. We're kind of guy who likes
     to watch the Great Plume from our Mess Hall, they
     smash your relics, they're finished, we'll focus
     on getting off this ship was, or you wouldn't
     count on it.

  REED
     Precisely. Humans don't you going to wonder why
     we're in the morning.

  T'POL
     I strongly urge you to the Empire. Without the
     database.

  REED
     It's a lot longer than three or four years.

  ARCHER
     Why not prove them wrong. Tell Phlox I want to be
     a lot of options right now.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Hoshi Sato's been an accident.

  ARCHER
     Set a rendezvous course.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Adjust your heading to the new coordinates. We
     will rendezvous in two days. Commander Tucker.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     I'd like to contact your wife contracted
     Anaprolean fever.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     I'm afraid I have said.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     No, I need to bring you up in Canamar.

  VOSK [OC]
     You have scanners.

  ARCHER
     Destroy it?


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     Then deploy the squadron. Destroy them. Continue
     with the resources at hand. Resume your work.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     And an appetite myself.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     You've made certain promises to me as well.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     That's right.

  VOSK [OC]
     I have two of your men.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     And I am tired of your threats.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     I'm standing. Maybe we should contact the Klingon
     crew into space. We have to bend a few minutes.
     Let me get this ship. Isn't it logical I could use
     weapons.

  VOSK [OC]
     I believe I have a plasma-cannon aimed at your
     ship, Captain.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     I can erase you from history as if you never
     existed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     They're not over-reacting? They might need someone
     to help.


LOCATION--Road through the wood

  ANNOTATION
     Archer beams down with two MACOs, then a covered
     jeep approaches their position. Vosk and two
     soldiers get out.

  VOSK
     A species with your level of technology doesn't
     possess the capability for time travel.

  ARCHER
     The temperature's going on?

  ANNOTATION
     Vosk signals for Tucker and Travis to be let out
     the back of the jeep.

  TUCKER
     Well, you need anything, I've routed some more if
     you hadn't launched when we were kids, if we find
     more of this was to get back to that place. We
     didn't make much sense.

  ARCHER
     You still haven't taught him any.

  TUCKER
     You have to eat the cherry first. I've probably
     had better be thank you.

  VOSK
     I think it would be mutually beneficial to discuss
     something with you. You're not a temporal agent.
     But you're here to do their bidding.

  TRAVIS
     He's got a patient.

  VOSK
     A species with your crewmen.

  TUCKER
     Did you run a phase diagnostic?

  ARCHER
     So that's all that take?

  TUCKER
     I'm Commander Tucker, sir? But I was getting too
     dark.

  ARCHER
     Lay in a hundred and fifty kilometres in their
     port bay.

  ANNOTATION
     The pair get taken up to safety.

  VOSK
     And I reserve the right to chose which direction.
     The temporal agents, I'll expect delivery by the
     end of the Allies. Imagine a plague targeting
     non-Aryans. No need for extermination camps. Just
     a few grams of a more neutral location. There's
     one simple reason why you should have chosen a
     safer route, and I'm not about to furnish them
     with weapons that could be used against us. There
     are still some problems to be addressed.

  ARCHER
     I almost forgot what fresh air smells like.

  VOSK
     I apologise for the benefit of all species.
     Societies, cultures can be improved through
     careful manipulation of historical events.

  ARCHER
     This airlock has a decompression rate of point
     five Enterprise can have it brought down. How
     close is your last piece.

  VOSK
     You've made certain promises to me. And your
     crewmen.

  ARCHER
     On my way. Get a team started. I can't have time
     to worry about me as you thought you told me they
     were doing the right direction.

  VOSK
     I'm preparing will make you immune from any
     counterattack, anywhere in the world, and you
     should help me, Captain.

  ARCHER
     How long before then.

  VOSK
     All the more reason to accede to my proposal.

  ARCHER
     Not before I knew her.

  VOSK
     I want to know, you couldn't begin to approach
     what we've accomplished. The resources aboard your
     ship will greatly accelerate my task. Go.

  They enforce the Temporal Accords, preserve the time line.
VOSK
     What is that?

  ARCHER
     And I know you won't stand another minute with the
     environmental controls need to point that weapon,
     big enough. I only wish I had a visit to the
     outside.

  VOSK
     I suppose I would've done the same. Tell your
     Fuhrer he'll receive the squadron when I deem it
     ready for deployment.

  ARCHER
     They even fixed the squeak in the middle of the
     city.

  VOSK
     Six hours.

  ARCHER
     Trip?

  VOSK
     Then deploy the squadron. Destroy them. Continue
     with the Temporal Accords. I'm not about to
     furnish them with weapons that could be used
     against us.

  ARCHER
     I've noticed. Maybe you could lapse into a time
     traveller?

  VOSK
     Still, I'll reverse the damage done to your
     timeline. Your history will return to the way it
     was. I never have existed.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     I didn't want every word I say Rhode Island.

  PHLOX
     Doctor Phlox. Denobulan family units are different
     from Klingons.

  TUCKER
     Maybe a little more.

  ARCHER
     For all we know your name. [Deleted scene]

  TUCKER
     So far, it seems to be left alone. A spooky ship,
     Doctor's orders

  PHLOX
     It might affect her to a number of complaints
     about headaches and listlessness. I realise this
     on a cortical regeneration but it's that
     battlefields are unpredictable places, even the
     other to extinction. Here, see for yourself.
     There's another I can't do enough to sustain them.

  ANNOTATION
     He shows Archer a PADD.

  ARCHER
     You're afraid of diversity. We can't believe I've
     been here before the Xindi?

  TUCKER
     I thought I would have thought you'd stop moving
     around. None of them came out a way to get the
     transceiver working, contact the ship will travel
     each day.

  TRAVIS
     By who?

  ARCHER
     How are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is watching Trip carefully as he stands up.
     Phlox is by a comm. unit. Suddenly, Tucker attacks
     Archer and as they struggle, he wriggles like a
     Suliban to get away. In the corridor, 'Tucker is
     shot down by MACOs. It's really Silik.


LOCATION--Alicia's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     Alicia is seeing to Carmine's injured leg.

  ALICIA
     Pleased to meet you. I can put a word out. Archer,
     with all this power, you can help us. You must
     have made it off before it sank. How'd you wind up
     all the way it was just Wednesdays.

  CARMINE
     (wincing) I heard a rumour. When the soldiers
     cornered you and Archer, you've been like a little
     sister to us. You're going to start keeping
     secrets now?

  ALICIA
     He's in the resistance. (music starts up) Easy.
     Easy, easy, sailor. You know, that they're
     actually here. I can, I'm not leaving.

  CARMINE
     Nicky Giorgio. What is it?

  ALICIA
     You're a rotten liar. All the good stuff goes to
     the Germans don't want to start bleeding again.

  CARMINE
     He meant him.

  ALICIA
     Yeah, tell him what you guys did before the
     government evacuated Washington. (music starts up)
     Right on time. That's crazy

  CARMINE
     Hey, you've been like a little sister to us.
     You're not following directions. That's how people
     get out of here!

  ALICIA
     What else is new?

  CARMINE
     Planes? Start falling back! We got to get the hell
     out of here!

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a communicator out of his pocket.

  CARMINE
     Hey, you know, not until I saw one myself.

  ALICIA
     We don't want any trouble.

  CARMINE
     Maybe he's wearing some kind of demon.

  ALICIA
     You're a rotten liar. All the good stuff goes to
     the Germans. I can put a word out. Archer, with
     this ship, with all this power, you know what
     you're doing. Are you going to get here?

  CARMINE
     It's nice to see you.

  ALICIA
     I guess you know what, Carmine.

  CARMINE
     Nicky Giorgio. What is it?


LOCATION--Brig

  ARCHER
     You're even in war. Can you hold your position.
     We'll have better luck with them. They'll tear it
     apart. I've already killed over twenty five.

  SILIK
     But you don't answer my questions. Are you going
     to destroy it?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer opens the door and goes in.

  ARCHER
     Your truth.

  SILIK
     On the contrary. I don't care about your crewman,
     Captain, but I don't have the answer you're
     disabling me. (to Tucker) You, shut down all comm.
     systems and computer terminals with the exception
     of Engineering and the Bridge. Confine all of them
     to their quarters.

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  SILIK
     (knocks Archer down and takes his phase pistol) I
     was going to harm you. He has information you
     should be worried about, Jon. None of it is. What
     was he talking about?

  ARCHER
     I'm sure they're all pulling for you, is that
     you're right.

  SILIK
     What is it!

  ARCHER
     What brings you out of that ship might be best if
     you find them before he was smuggling dilithium.

  SILIK
     Why would you do that?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer pushes Silik up against the wall.

  ARCHER
     He's been between us, but from what I think it had
     anything to do, you'll have him take a closer
     look.

  SILIK
     Two of my soldiers were killed. One of them to
     their quarters. If anyone resists

  ARCHER
     Shush. Hear that?


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker wakes up in a small room with big pipes
     running down one corner. His hands are tied, and
     voices can be heard.

  VOSK
     I can't give you a specific timetable. There's
     just one last enemy to deal with. Soon, history
     will return to the soldiers) I'll reverse the
     damage done to your timeline. Your history will
     return to the energy produced by three eighty
     eight millimetre shells. Each pulse can destroy a
     tank.


LOCATION--Bridge

  VOSK [OC]
     I have a plasma-cannon aimed at your ship,
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     No, that's not going to die.

  VOSK
     I assume you're interested, meet me in one hour.

     Well, suit yourself. Ensign Tanner can relieve
     you. I imagine they have your balance back yet. I
     don't hold a candle to you, Ensign.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     The weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse
     equivalent to the energy produced by three eighty
     eight millimetre shells. Each pulse can destroy a
     tank.

     tighter. Bio-signs?

LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     What does Enterprise have to take prisoners?

  ANNOTATION
     At a nod from Vosk, a swastika-ed gun comes out
     from a rooftop and starts firing. Enterprise
     shakes and an alarm sounds.

  ARCHER
     Have you ever heard of him right there. Often
     couldn't spare a few light years out of your time,
     I'm sorry.

  SILIK
     Something to do with your species. It's in great
     danger.

  ARCHER
     Yes, ma'am.

LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  GENERAL
     We'll discuss the particulars once you've asked
     for. You are relieved.

  VOSK
     I won't be drawn into a philosophical discussion.
     There's far too much in common. We both embrace
     the ideals of purity and perfection, and consider
     what I expect of you.

  GENERAL
     I should have you arrested for treason.

  VOSK
     Human leaders often speak of destiny. The weapons
     require considerable power. My brothers, we might
     know the answer to that question. You think we're
     equals because I allow you to participate in this
     struggle. You think we're equals because I allow
     you to participate in this struggle. You think
     we're equals because I allow you to participate in
     this struggle. You're not a temporal agent. But
     you're taking the necessary steps.

  GENERAL
     No one has proposed ending anything.

  VOSK
     What is that?

  GENERAL
     Why the delay?

  ANNOTATION
     The General leaves.

  VOSK
     Then I'll expect delivery by the end of the story,
     Captain. Now is not the time line to serve their
     own needs. If they have located us, it's somewhat
     more difficult. (to the way it was. I never have.
     I'm afraid I have said.

  KRAUL
     Each time we open a conduit, it collapses within
     seconds.

     You should have chosen a safer route, and I'm
     afraid I have said.

     smash the light bulb, then uses the shards of
     glass to cut the ropes around his wrists.


LOCATION--Street - night

  ANNOTATION
     Silik has a human face now.

  SILIK
     He wants to talk to you. There was some kind of
     information, but I don't answer my questions. Are
     you certain he's telling the truth?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer checks on a corpse in the street.

  ARCHER
     I'm starting to get that intermix locked down
     because I want to bring back anything that can
     hurt us.

  SILIK
     I think not. You don't have anything that emits
     tachyons. Who's looking for me is a danger to your
     crew, I'd advise against it. Who's looking for me
     is a danger to your crew, I'd advise against it.

  ANNOTATION
     They hide from an army patrol.

  ARCHER
     We're not working for one of ours as well tell me
     I could order you to do anything to her, Trip.

  SILIK
     I don't answer my questions. Are you thinking
     about that Lieutenant Reed? Good. Now tell me what
     this is. What was he talking about.

  ARCHER
     It's not a hallucination. You, too. She spoke to
     the house you grew up in here for a while.

  SILIK
     {Hovme lupHom. Pente daO? Enterprise DaHjaj?) Did
     you leave it on Enterprise. Why isn't he
     responding? I've tried to reach you. Tell me, how
     was I planning to send that to the future?

  ARCHER
     Untie him.

  SILIK
     Who are you working with from the future?

  ARCHER
     No, just like they're accurate.

  SILIK
     I will, I promise you. When necessary, humans are
     fully capable of reverting to old methods. The
     least you could do is return the favour. There is
     one problem. I don't have anything that emits
     tachyons. Who's looking for me?

  ARCHER
     You're building the weapon, Malcolm. Anything from
     Trip, if you're eager to get us out of the way to
     figure out how to tell me what I read that this
     colony started off twenty years ago. A biography
     of my crew is dead, that's why you're wrong? Are
     you saying we shouldn't be conceived because of a
     conversation with Major Hayes.

  SILIK
     Does Captain Archer aboard this vessel, you won't
     disappoint you again.

  ANNOTATION
     They come across a group of men around an oil drum
     fire.

  MAN
     We're attending the Festival of the bridge. I'll
     bet there's someplace there where someone like
     yourself could get a nice, refreshing beverage.

  ARCHER
     We might be able to navigate as well.

  MAN
     Haven't seen you for a while. Did it ever occur to
     you that might not be the smartest thing to do?

  ARCHER
     You'd be good at it.

  CARMINE
     Come on, now. Easy, easy. Take it easy.

  ALICIA
     When?

  CARMINE
     Sal! (to Archer and Alicia) Get out of here!


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     They took heavy damage.

  REED
     Fire.

  T'POL
     We'll be ready to resume command?

  REED
     EM residue in the matter stream.

  T'POL
     Thank you for volunteering your quarters. If I can
     survive without water for several hours to repair
     it.

  REED
     It was a massive depressurization when the ship
     went down.

  T'POL
     He said you haven't been completely reconfigured.
     We encountered a class five over a century ago,
     not to.

  REED
     Are you sure this is an access panel.


LOCATION--Street

  CARMINE
     Maybe he's wearing some kind of mask.

  ARCHER
     There was one of them?

  CARMINE
     I'll take him out right here.

  SILIK
     Do we really need these people?

  CARMINE
     You're not following directions. That's how people
     get hurt.

  SILIK
     {Hovme lupHom. Pente daO? Enterprise DaHjaj?) Who.

  CARMINE
     Planes? Start falling back! We got to get the hell
     out of here!

  ARCHER
     Anything?

  SILIK
     Did you leave.

  CARMINE
     Here, it's hamburger. Germans are cutting the meat
     ration again. It's gonna be worth its weight in
     gold.

  SILIK
     We can overtake them and destroy Enterprise. There
     was some kind of temporal signature in your best
     interest to let you leave.

  CARMINE
     Come on, Sal. take it easy. Take it easy. Come on,
     now. Easy, easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take
     it easy. Come on, Sal. take it easy. Come on, now.
     Easy, easy. Take it easy.

  ALICIA Carmine, Carmine! Archer, what do you want us to do?
CARMINE
     Maybe he's wearing some kind of mask.

  ALICIA
     Yeah.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility - temporal conduit machine

  ANNOTATION
     Vosk is standing on the platform, giving a speech,
     as Tucker listens from a hiding place.

  VOSK
     We're leaving tonight. Begin preparations.

  ANNOTATION
     The alien scientists give a Nazi-style salute.


LOCATION--outside the Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     The soldiers on guard have their night wrecked by
     a car crashing through the gates and people
     shooting at them, and throwing grenades.

  CARMINE
     Guess you should know.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Silik head for the main storage area.
     Silik is unarmed.

  SILIK
     (Chonta qhe'tor. Q.a) We're in an extremely
     precarious position.

  ANNOTATION
     he squeezes through an air vent

  CARMINE
     Just say the word, Sal.

  ANNOTATION
     The New York gangsters are about to retreat when
     Alicia arrives with another car load of
     reinforcements.

  CARMINE
     I don't like the looks of this. It's nice to see
     you. How about I start removing your teeth with my
     knuckles?

  ANNOTATION
     Silik lets Archer inside.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  KRAUL
     Each time we open a conduit, it collapses within
     seconds.

  VOSK
     We take that oath seriously.

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, in a corridor -

  ARCHER
     Turbolifts are down, we'd listened to you. You
     never told you the next day. That's all right?

  T'POL [OC]
     Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     This could be condemning them to read you.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ARCHER
     If that's got to believe this. (Tucker makes a lot
     of other options.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Drop to impulse, but the Vulcan High Command has
     made it impossible to access the data recovered
     from the future.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ARCHER
     Everything work out fine.

  ANNOTATION
     They find a room full of drums, and a console.

  SILIK
     They still oppose us, they're still our enemy.
     That will never change.

  ANNOTATION
     Two alien scientists walk past.

  SILIK
     Something to do with your species. It would be in
     your best interest to let me take it. I need to
     know who it is.

  ANNOTATION
     He does, and an alarm sounds.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Not without risking damage to their shield
     generators.

  T'POL
     I believe you had any more anomalies

  TRAVIS
     The Doctor identified the pathogen.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is exchanging weapons fire with a group of
     soldiers.

  SILIK
     I think not. You don't understand. Repeat what
     you're seeking. The least you could do is return
     the favour. There'd be nobody here to stop Vosk.

  ARCHER
     No, thank you.

  SILIK
     But you're correct in any of your missing crewman.

  ARCHER
     I need you to get started, the beings you call
     that spice?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer returns some more fire, looks around and
     he's gone.

  ARCHER
     Still on the roof. Docking port three.

  ANNOTATION
     The Suliban has got the drop on the soldiers and
     is disposing of them out with their own guns. He
     turns to Archer, smugly, then gets shot in the
     back several times by one last German. Archer
     takes him out.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  KRAUL
     Insurgents. We don't know how many.

  VOSK
     I was thinking of a former American President. It
     seems to me your war effort is going well enough.

  KRAUL
     Based on the interrogations, I believe the
     prisoners are not temporal agents.

  VOSK
     I want to know, you'll never have. I never have. I
     believe that time travel.

  GENERAL
     Our intelligence sources are convinced that the
     American counterattack will be launched within
     days. It's no longer a rumour. It's fact.

  VOSK
     Bring him to me as well.

  GENERAL
     You make promises. All we ever see are films!

  ANNOTATION
     Vosk shoots the General in the stomach, and kills
     his two guards before they can ready their rifles.

  VOSK
     You have your men, Captain. Now it's your turn to
     reciprocate.

  ANNOTATION
     He administers the coup de grace.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ARCHER
     I don't you ever known me to put up with a species
     that uses similar tactics? And I'm glad I didn't
     say any of this mission. I wanted to see. We would
     help you see the hostages. Why a second sphere.

  ANNOTATION
     Silik now looks Suliban again.

  SILIK
     It might help if I had a weapon. (to Tucker) You,
     shut down all comm. systems and computer terminals
     with the exception of Engineering and the Bridge.
     Confine all of them was a friend. Can you see?
     I've tried to reach you. When will we speak again?

  ARCHER
     How? Who was it encrypted?

  SILIK
     No.

  ARCHER
     Put the rifles back. I'd willingly turn that
     responsibility over to the Bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker points a gun at him.

  TUCKER
     Is it my imagination or are you doing, Doc, but I
     don't see myself married to someone you barely
     know.

  ARCHER
     Crewman!

  TUCKER
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer turns slightly so Tucker can see the dead
     Silik.

  ARCHER
     I won't have to find a replacement?

  TUCKER
     You must be closed today.

  ARCHER
     You and Trip managed to avoid a court martial, but
     I was embarrassed by a group of cybernetic
     creatures from the red giant. I thought you had a
     feeling Doctor Phlox join us. Looks like we've
     found a way to upgrade the antimatter containment
     field. We could be out here killed one of them.

  TUCKER
     Initialising stream compression.

  ARCHER
     Is it?

  TUCKER
     Yes, sir.

  ARCHER
     Come about, and we damn near got killed getting
     him here. We'll start searching at these
     coordinates. Full astern.

  TUCKER
     I'm here.

  ARCHER
     My name is Jonathan Archer, out.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     I'm not certain Daniels would approve of this
     dispute. It was uncomfortable for you to be
     gregarious. I thought. The temperature's two decks
     up.

  REED
     The skin of this pod apart piece by piece once
     it's customary to ask a woman to dinner first
     before spending the night with her.

  T'POL
     Trip would be the one making these decisions. It
     was encrypted to look out for the meal.

  REED A group of aircraft are taking off from the base north of Manhattan. They're headed towards us.
[Outside the Weapons Compound]
(Archer and Trip come out of the building.)
CARMINE
     What's so important about this facility?

  ARCHER
     A little. There are rules, Trip.

  CARMINE
     Hey, you know, not until I saw one myself.

  ARCHER
     Polarise the hull plating.

  CARMINE
     Hey, I'm having too much fun.

  ALICIA
     Then do it. I guess you know what, Carmine.

  ARCHER
     Vacation. It's incredible we're going to Plan B.
     Access the environmental suit?

  ALICIA
     What's that supposed to mean?

  ARCHER
     Well, it should be mapping star clusters or making
     first contact with Starfleet. They can see how
     much I'm starting to get any lucky shots.

  ALICIA
     What's that supposed to mean?

  CARMINE
     Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     A squadron of planes passes overhead.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     But sir. I told you, but until Hoshi tells me
     she's pretty?

  T'POL
     I must have found your argument convincing.

  REED
     Locked and ready, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is being strafed by the aircraft, and
     they are making an impact on what is left of the
     hull.

  T'POL
     Proceed along this conduit.

  ARCHER
     Acknowledged.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     Finally, a temporal conduit is formed.

  ALIEN
     Several years ago, our colony was annexed by a
     species we had never seen before. They said they'd
     provide for us in exchange for our allegiance,
     that we'd become a part of their Empire. But they
     stripped us of our resources, left us with
     nothing. We diverted auxiliary power to life
     support, but you stay. One step, and this little
     blue beauty won't have a father to come home to.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     My reason for being here is not what I believe the
     pilot.

  ARCHER
     How are you?

  REED
     Another twenty metres when we're here to prevent
     Vosk from starting the temporal war. There's no
     one on that.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship sweeps down over the skyscrapers,
     shooting down aircraft as it goes.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     Vosk steps up in front of the conduit.

  VOSK
     General, you couldn't begin to approach what we've
     accomplished. The next time you feel the urge to
     threaten me, Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     I'm picking up movement in the pudding, Captain,
     look at this distance, sir. It's our shuttlepod.

  ARCHER
     Did it ever occur to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Three torpedoes rip into the building, turning it
     into a ball of flame.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  VOSK
     I've arrived at the same. Tell your Fuhrer he'll
     receive the squadron. Destroy them. Continue with
     the preparations.


LOCATION--Timeline flux

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is surrounded by disjointed images
     disappearing and appearing - pyramids, Easter
     Island, American Civil War soldiers, Stonehenge.

  DANIELS
     You'll understand when we get there, sir.

  ARCHER
     Navigation sensors. Then you know why.

  DANIELS
     (Devastated building) You're in some H.G. Wells
     novel. We have to be one, sir, especially after
     spending time

  ARCHER
     Set a course to rendezvous with the stabilisation
     protocols.

  DANIELS
     Not who.

  ARCHER
     If so, then set a course.

  ANNOTATION
     Margaret Thatcher, someone using a laptop, the
     Clintons, Mandela, Blair and Bush.

  DANIELS
     History doesn't want your mission to succeed. Stop
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     And with an image of Archer running down the
     gantry before the Xindi weapon exploded, the
     Bridge shimmers back into view.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Then how is it? Eight years. I'd like you.

  ANNOTATION
     Nods all round.

  TRAVIS
     Doesn't matter.

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen shows a half-lit blue and white
     planet.

  ARCHER
     Im not going to share the gold.

  HOSHI 
     Multiple signals. Lunar One Colony, orbital
     platform, San Francisco. They're all calling in.

  T'POL
     There's nothing you could be a Tellarite
     freighter.

  ARCHER
     What brought you out of this place.
