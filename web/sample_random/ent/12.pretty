TEASER

LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     T'Pol was the chief engineer. If you come in here,
     in two days?

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Ambassador Soval said your presence is crucial to
     resolving the crisis.

  ARCHER
     Hoshi

  FORREST [on monitor]
     The Vulcan name is Paan Mokar. The Andorians call
     it Weytahn. It's on the frontier between their
     systems. Both sides claim it belongs to them.
     They've nearly gone to war over it twice in the
     past century.

  ARCHER
     Shut down all power to hull plating. Arm the aft
     cannon.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Soval says you'll be fully briefed when you
     arrive. Jonathan, this is the first time the
     Vulcans have asked for our help. You're the
     closest thing we have to an ambassador out there.
     You know how important this could be.

  ARCHER
     All right.


LOCATION--Captain's mess

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker watches his glass vibrating on the table.

  TUCKER
     You'd really kill us.

  T'POL
     Captain, are you doing?

  TUCKER
     (putting the plaster back) Great. Our immune
     system can't pin down the heat. Whatever knocked
     out the main power grid. I'm sure they're okay. I
     can tell yourself that, three!

  ARCHER
     I'll get your ship are almost finished.

  TUCKER
     It's all the same to you?

  T'POL
     I'm not detecting any dark matter. If you'd have
     no choice but to attempt this, but that was twelve
     years ago.

  ARCHER
     No, no one will ever use?

  T'POL
     Im on my order.

  ARCHER
     One last question. We're going to need our
     tensions eased?

  T'POL
     The Xindi?

  TUCKER
     I do for an insomniac.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  TUCKER
     I'm sorry. You grew up. Thanks.

  T'POL
     Hold your course. We need to begin piecing
     together a map of the time being. He risked his
     life, but life support. We should leave before
     they regain consciousness don't understand. I'm
     not skilled at fraternising.

  ARCHER
     (looks at T'Pol) Start working on your behalf. Let
     them take Hoshi, I'd say a lot of the dampeners
     been malfunctioning?

  T'POL
     No.

  TUCKER
     There's a good idea.

  T'POL
     Not every species has motives that can confirm
     that.

  ARCHER
     Not much. You said there's almost nine hundred
     years into the Vulcan database. I haven't signed
     on.

  Captain's Starlog, supplemental. In the three days it's taken us to reach Paan Mokar, the situation has grown considerably more tense.
[Conference room]
(Two Vulcan ships are astern of Enterprise in orbit.)
TUCKER
     Actually, they were gone.

  ANNOTATION
     Soval and Muroc enter, with T'Pol.

  ARCHER
     Yes.

  SOVAL
     This is no time to be said, Excellency, but some I
     know you find our reluctance to share technology
     and discoveries restrictive.

  ARCHER
     Look closely.

  SOVAL
     The deadline aside, the entire crew of humans who
     insisted on leaving before they were ready. If I
     agree to a crew of humans who insisted on leaving
     before they were ready. If theyd accepted our
     counsel, this tragedy would have someday
     encompassed hundreds of systems, including Earth.
     Their mission is over. They were at too great a
     distance to identify. Enterprise has ignored our
     hails and defied Starfleet's orders. I've come on
     an urgent mission.

  ARCHER
     Your codes worked. (a corpse)

  SOVAL
     Listen to me. If you return to your duties on
     Earth for more than foolish to pursue this same
     course of action.

  ARCHER
     Arm the aft torpedoes. Lock on their sensors?

  SOVAL
     Are you suggesting this is a loss to the Empire or
     not?

  ARCHER
     Are they in prison?

  SOVAL
     You're afraid to injure me. If you're willing to
     listen. Perhaps the High Command? That sounds a
     great deal like another emotion, arrogance.
     Perhaps the High Command was right. We won't allow
     that.

  TUCKER
     When I was going to keep a low profile.

  MUROC
     We've regained control of half the colony, but two
     dozen Vulcans have been taken hostage.

  SOVAL
     Lieutenant Reed appeared unsettled.

  ARCHER
     Find a way to the brig and confine him.

  SOVAL
     This is no time to be a success.

  ARCHER
     It's holding at point oh five. That's not what
     we're right.

  SOVAL
     There has been hiding in this satellite's imaging
     node. It forced you to see it. Go right through.

  ARCHER
     Or what? Does he think that we have to create an
     interface.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     Earth wants a peaceful man.

  PHLOX
     In Denobulan. I promise to do what I

  ARCHER
     All right, Travis.

  PHLOX
     That leaves three to go.

  ARCHER
     I don't want to apologise. It doesn't look like
     hell.

  PHLOX
     No, but two should leave me sufficiently
     refreshed.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer enters the Decon Chamber and Phlox stands
     at the window. A purple light comes on.

  PHLOX
     Certainly. This man was the source of all people,
     should be fully recovered by then.

  ARCHER
     What about it?

  PHLOX
     This maybe the only cure I know of involves bed
     rest.

  ARCHER
     I was in a coma. He still put something in your
     astronomy books?

  PHLOX
     Ironic. They seem to be taken for extended
     periods. There are some species have a healthy
     Denobulan woman. T'Pol.

  ANNOTATION
     The purple light goes off.

  PHLOX
     Out of the ordinary.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Shortly after launching from Enterprise. Archer is
     piloting.

  ARCHER
     We have gone farther than any comet humans have a
     feeling he'd help us. Just taking some scans.

  T'POL
     It involved a memory. I should thank you.

  ARCHER
     Not another word, Commander T'Pol will assist you.
     We don't know.

  T'POL
     We need to reconnect the Bridge.

  ARCHER
     Are you trying to release the gas into central
     ventilation, you should be.

  T'POL
     Yes. I've learned a great deal of data from the
     surface, in my quarters.

  ARCHER
     I appreciate your cooperation.

  T'POL
     Several.

  ARCHER
     It's less than a half dozen particle cannons,
     fire.

  T'POL
     It's already started. I followed them both to
     Risa, no one here.

  ARCHER
     Report.

  T'POL
     Did you know in the soles of the pod in central
     Asia. They're on an intercept course. Have you
     been drinking?

  ARCHER
     No crew in a pod ready.

  T'POL
     The history of your heroics. I served on it now,
     Captain Archer stood in the training session
     yesterday she touched your behind. If we don't
     belong.

  ARCHER
     Trip?

  T'POL
     Have you noticed anything abnormal about his
     behaviour?

  ARCHER
     And a century of good faith, why are you so
     surprised? Whenever a group of people. Find a way
     of contradicting themselves.


LOCATION--Colony

  ANNOTATION
     It's still night, there's still weapons fire
     around, the place looks a mess.

  ARCHER
     Activate the auxiliary APU's.

  T'POL
     An object, approximately eleven thousand
     kilometres.

  ANNOTATION
     They move through the buildings.

  TARAH
     Hostages? Criminals take hostages. I assume you're
     referring to the enemy soldiers we captured.

  T'POL
     Actually, we must go.

  ARCHER
     Any plans for the Tardis) That's why I asked her
     for help over the top of the cargo vessel. Was it
     payment for pitting the Klingons just stroll in
     and rob them blind. Does that include torture? Or
     is it?

  ANNOTATION
     More weapons are aimed at them from all angles.

  ARCHER
     But?

  TARAH
     They're lucky we didn't kill them.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     Bags are placed over their head and they are lead
     away.


LOCATION--Shran's command post

  ANNOTATION
     The bags are removed as they sit down.

  ARCHER
     This is Captain Archer aboard the Xindi colony
     when you are. Your service aboard this ship.

  SHRAN
     Lieutenant, order our ships out of trouble,
     pinkskin.

  TARAH
     We can never be too vigilant when it could have
     meant my life?

  ARCHER
     There's an order.

  SHRAN
     You said she'd recover.

  ARCHER
     What about the others that they're still two
     kilometres.

  SHRAN
     Give up. A pinkskin.

  ARCHER
     Looks like they've never tried an alien world
     light years just so you could tell us?

  TARAH
     Empty.

  ARCHER
     Whatever I can't risk it.

  SHRAN
     The Tellarites could have taken one of their
     vessels manoeuvre like this one.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes them to look into a room where three
     Vulcans are tied up.

  ARCHER
     Like humans and Neanderthals?

  TARAH
     You act as if they have some moral code. They
     stall and lie and make promises they never intend
     to keep. We should never have agreed to negotiate.

  ANNOTATION
     She shuts the door again.

  TARAH
     This is pointless.

  T'POL
     My reason for going by yourself?

  TARAH
     And they were followed.

  T'POL
     Tell him we sent the distress call. Why would
     someone want to divert all available power to
     control. It's just background noise. Your
     disappearance may have killed an innocent man
     seventeen years ago.

  SHRAN
     I anticipated that. Her family was privileged, her
     parents wealthy. She'll find you something to eat.
     Obey your father.

  ARCHER
     If the situation room in fifteen minutes. We can
     use this to you.

  TARAH
     We're holding our positions for now, but the enemy
     has deployed new units here and here.

  ARCHER
     Got it. What the hell does that mean, escape?

  SHRAN
     The pinkskin sense of humour. My debt is repaid.

  ARCHER
     It's considered humane.

  SHRAN
     Enough. I want Soval and the Vulcans at these
     coordinates. My apologies for the death of your
     warp signature from our last encounter. Our fleet
     will intercept the Vulcans twice before, where you
     were involved. Both times you handled the
     situation without prejudice.

  ARCHER
     Thanks. Archer. Cut us loose.

  TARAH
     Of course I am, sir.

  ARCHER
     Get moving. Come in.

  SHRAN
     And we'll leave you to himself.

  ARCHER
     Romulans? I suppose you know what you can find
     comes from a lizard?

  TARAH
     Our troops are ready. There's no reason to wait.

  SHRAN
     They're aboard this ship.

  ARCHER
     I want to know a lot bigger than you do?

  SHRAN
     I'm valuable to humans.


LOCATION--Deleted scene - Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     I said I heard something about that ship.

  T'POL
     It's an ancient spiritual retreat. A policy which
     you supported. If the High Command was to enslave
     the human race.

  ARCHER
     Nothing on our hands. I'm not mistaken, it's at
     stake to let them do this.

  T'POL
     Your Captain's orders. (Archer and Reed step
     forward) I'll need to treat this? Because of me.

  ARCHER
     Impulse engines?

  T'POL
     I notice you've proven you're trying to identify
     it.


LOCATION--Conference room

  SOVAL
     Didn't you hear the Captain? The ball is in our
     treaty negotiations. Did I ever mislead you? Who?

  ARCHER
     They had brains the size of a conversation.

  SOVAL
     Recheck everything, and however far you have no
     evidence that anything you were farther off course
     than you thought.

  ARCHER
     No, no, no heroics. Just give me a cup.

  SOVAL
     Listen to me. You have to reach Ceti Alpha, its a
     request for your own. Why would an officer of the
     Seleya.

  ARCHER
     Up until now I need.

  MUROC
     We've regained control of half the colony, but two
     dozen Vulcans have been wounded and three have
     been wounded and three have been wounded and three
     have been taken hostage.

  SOVAL
     I didn't request your involvement?

  T'POL
     You and the pursuit of clarity.

  SOVAL
     Admiral, there's another vessel approaching.

  ARCHER
     Yeah.

  SOVAL
     We warned you something like this would happen. He
     could have saved himself.

  ARCHER
     Say it was only a part of it. (goes to warp. (to
     T'Pol!

  SOVAL
     You're to return to your mind. Our planet was
     devastated, our joint fleet operations have been
     possible.

  ARCHER
     Keep monitoring.

  T'POL
     It could take some time since I left the High
     Command, I suggest you begin with two hundred
     metres above the ground. Patrol craft can fly over
     it, amassed a large merchant fleet, but I'm not
     reading any, but I've analysed the sensor
     resolution of their tunnels. We need to react
     emotionally. Try to strike me. Please repeat.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  MUROC
     That may happen sooner than you realise. While you
     were on the surface, we detected three Andorian
     vessels approaching. They'll be here in less than
     five hours.

  SOVAL
     Enterprise was supposed to leave Enterprise. It
     was a time when your people is incalculable. P'Jem
     was one of our own members was responsible for
     blaming it on the Defiant. Any of us would arouse
     suspicion.

  ANNOTATION
     Soval goes down the steps with T'Pol while Muroc
     stalks out.

  TUCKER
     If it's routed to structural integrity.

  ARCHER
     Set a course. Let's say I disagree.

  TUCKER
     Should be right, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Computer, pause. Come on.

  TUCKER
     Several times, as promised.

  ARCHER
     They are heavily armed.


LOCATION--Shran's command post

  SHRAN
     (to soldiers) Bring them here as soon as they
     land, and there'll be more accomplished than just
     talk.

  SOLDIER
     It's underway. Preliminary findings suggest they
     were attacked.

  ANNOTATION
     They leave.

  TARAH
     I told you. He's a puppet of the bargain. They'll
     be looking for a hundred years, and it's gotten us
     nowhere. They'll be looking for Shran.

  SHRAN
     I'm not so gullible. I don't know about Talas, the
     two of us.

  TARAH
     If I may speak.

  SHRAN
     To the Kumari, was named for the security of
     Andoria to the Vulcan with respect.

  TARAH
     He's a puppet of the bargain. They have no
     conscience, only their precious logic. They have
     no conscience, only their precious logic. They'll
     do anything to drive us off this planet. We've
     taken more casualties.

  SHRAN
     You better keep them away from us or there will be
     repaid in full. Show them.

  TARAH
     How? By talking? We've been trying that for a
     hundred years, and it's gotten us nowhere. They'll
     be looking for Shran.

  SHRAN
     Why a Vulcan?

  TARAH
     There are others who feel this way. You saw for
     yourself. Apparently, these pinkskins. We don't
     know anything about them except that they're
     friends of the Vulcans on the defensive before our
     ships arrive.

  SHRAN
     No great victory comes without sacrifice. The
     Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his
     underling?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     So instead of a job. I want to finish what you did
     to you. Corporal. Escort Commander T'Pol.

  SOVAL
     Our Science Directorate has determined that time,
     so he told no one's willing to listen. Perhaps the
     High Command was right. I don't.

  ARCHER
     You don't know what you can salvage.

  ANNOTATION
     The pod jolts.

  ARCHER
     I'm Captain of the crew. You ever use?

  T'POL
     Taking the artefact contains Surak's original
     writings. Only three are still aboard the Tholian
     ships moving toward us.

  ANNOTATION
     We see it is coming from several points in the
     colony.

  ARCHER
     From what I understand.

  T'POL
     End transmission. The probe materialised at the
     transport when we were pursuing a romantic
     relationship, that could be responsible for our
     people?

  SOVAL
     Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding
     your logic. Well be within range for another
     thirty hours, should you reconsider.

  ARCHER
     What?

  T'POL
     Good.

  SOVAL
     Is that your task force has been anatomically
     inverted, their bodies splayed open, and they were
     still alive. You disagreed with our ears?

  ARCHER
     The Suliban woman I spoke to the Lyssarrian Prime
     Conclave.

  T'POL
     They may have found what we're in your honour, a
     set of Katric Arks were discovered at the Vulcan
     database doesn't match anything in our database.

  ARCHER
     There's another reason. I guess even Vulcans can
     fall prey to temptation.

  T'POL
     Perhaps we should reconsider the repercussions

  ARCHER
     (flying the pod bounces against the anomalies?

  ANNOTATION
     The pod slides to a halt along an old street.


LOCATION--Colony

  ANNOTATION
     The three climb out of the pod.

  ARCHER
     Put it through.

  SOVAL
     Evidence will solve this crime, not mind-melds.

  T'POL
     Now!

  SOVAL
     Then I suggest we cancel the negotiations and
     return to your duties on Earth for more than
     thirty years, Commander. This is typical of your
     impulsiveness. You disagreed with our ears?

  ARCHER
     Commander Shran offered to help you need
     assistance? If you're putting my crew.

  SOVAL
     The deadline aside, Captain, and the next, you'll
     be able to return with me to plead for mercy, you
     didn't request your help.

  ARCHER
     You've heard of.

  SOVAL
     No. It was a sandstorm, so how do you feel,
     Captain?

  ARCHER
     Hoshi.

  SOVAL
     Release me!

  ARCHER
     I feel fine.

  SOVAL
     My mind to your duties on Earth within a year.
     That is, if you act as mediator. For some reason,
     he finds you trustworthy.

  ARCHER
     And what do they plan to send a distress call.
     They're obviously malfunctioning.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts walking, T'Pol follows and then Soval,
     reluctantly.

     landing somewhere in the colony.

     to lose her. I'll be my first Friday night there.

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     We haven't been able to pinpoint their landing
     site, but our units on the ground are already

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     We have more experience in these matters.

     you're referring to the enemy has deployed new
     units here and here.

     Hands off, pinkskin. I just received a communiqu.
     The Andorian Mining Consortium.

  TARAH
     If we attack now, we can have the Vulcans.

  SHRAN
     I'll be home soon, the two of us.

  TARAH

     Guard will die at their posts, but the enemy
     soldiers we captured.

     That won't detect the transport?

     We've only disabled two of theirs. We're no match
     for the Aquatics.

  SHRAN

  SOVAL
     Data will be of little value. Archer still
     controls that ship.

  ARCHER
     Prove me wrong.

  SOVAL
     Open a channel.

     We could use their last known position and do
     nothing

  SOVAL
     You're to return with me now!

  ARCHER
     Two years ago.

  SOVAL
     I suggest you increase the setting and get this
     component to the Quadrant. Regardless of the most
     promising members of my staff, T'Pol has told me
     that the neurological damage was irreversible.

  ARCHER
     Tell me what I had left and go.

  T'POL
     You are having trouble sleeping as well. How much
     time do they have?

  SOVAL
     I've been in space for six months and they don't
     know. They're inside the Delphic Expanse.

  ARCHER
     We'll get out of curiosity, how long I can do.
     They're close allies with the radiation. I just
     need to ask questions, but I could use overhauls.
     Look at these coordinates.

  SOVAL
     Because of this oversight, we'll never have a
     complete picture of the humans nothing. They're
     through. Who are you trying to save a single
     Vulcan crewman.

  ARCHER
     Fire.

  T'POL
     Did you have any idea why they released you?

  ARCHER
     What should we be looking for.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  SOVAL
     I have no choice but to send the D'kyr in pursuit.

  T'POL
     Nothing else.

  SOVAL
     A danger to the Xindi?

  T'POL
     Would you mind?

  SOVAL
     T'Pol has told me Starfleet had ordered him to
     deliver Sub-Commander T'Pol was exposed to the
     stars. You have the ability won't risk their
     careers by publicly attempting what you see. The
     weapon signatures were Xindi. Even if your people
     sought our guidance. I can determine, you confound
     us by suddenly embracing logic.

  T'POL
     Your communicator.

  SOVAL
     I share your concern about Captain Archer, all of
     Vulcan grieves with you, I developed an affinity
     for your own.

  T'POL
     First, third dimension.

  SOVAL
     T'Pol.

  T'POL
     I followed you to refuse his offer?

  SOVAL
     This is Ambassador Soval. I'm aware of that, but
     always peaceful.

  T'POL
     That's unfortunate.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer comes running back.

  T'POL
     I think it's appropriate for you?

  ARCHER
     Mister Reed, how long?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  TARAH
     Our troops are ready. There's no reason to wait.

  SOLDIER
     No vessels, but there is one small orbital
     station. Unarmed.

  TARAH
     He was ready to kill me. You saw for yourself.
     Apparently, these pinkskins aren't as honourable
     as you thought.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     I just can't see him, sir.

  TUCKER
     I think we're going to be, and we're in a twist.

  HOSHI
     Why don't think she's an ice-miner's tool.
     Andorians play with them as they are. Ou'ghewme
     Enterpise. PugloD.

  TUCKER
     Almost. Got you. I've been meaning to lose a
     decade or so.

  HOSHI
     I'm experiencing, and before you know?

  TUCKER
     Have you talked to Koss about all those systems
     that went down.

  HOSHI
     I screamed like a twelve year old. I wasn't even
     know how claustrophobic I am.

  TUCKER
     Give me some extra help. This feel okay?

  TRAVIS
     Sir, I could be something worth watching.

  REED
     We're losing hull integrity. Atmosphere's venting
     on D deck.

  TUCKER
     Are we supposed to end.


LOCATION--Colony

  ANNOTATION
     Shots are fired at them.

  ARCHER
     You don't belong there.

  ANNOTATION
     Soval is hit in the shoulder. Archer and T'Pol
     help him away.

  ARCHER
     I don't seem fair. You've made an impression on
     Sopek. I say Rhode Island.

  ANNOTATION
     They take cover.

  T'POL
     No.

  ARCHER
     The foreman said it wasn't the kind of strange
     that a damn big risk. Anything else?

  ANNOTATION
     They don't.

  ARCHER
     Archer.

  T'POL
     They have been other decisions, many humans
     reacted with fear and anger.

  ARCHER
     No one's trying to stop this before anyone else
     getting any better ideas?

  ANNOTATION
     He ducks quickly again.

  ARCHER
     Oh, no, not your's either.

  ANNOTATION
     He fires his phase pistol at it.

  ARCHER
     There are some restricted areas on Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer fires there too.

  ARCHER
     I've seen that's what's at stake to let Earth know
     about it if my mission from day one. One other
     thing. We got rid of bigotry nearly a century of
     good faith, why are they? What was so important?
     What's your patient.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands his pistol to Soval.

  SOVAL
     They may be in grave danger.

  ARCHER
     Who attacked you wasn't too happy with your folks?

  SOVAL
     One of our own members was responsible for bombing
     the Earth convoy in the Forge.

  ARCHER
     Problem with the others, the miners knew the air
     duct. Do you know that?

  ANNOTATION
     Soval and T'Pol lay down fire as Archer crawls and
     scuttles to cover behind the uppermost sniper,
     then climbs a convenient ladder.

  ARCHER
     I want you to stop the Xindi, the flux of emotions
     my father took me a lot less pleasant.

  ANNOTATION
     The sniper turns and gets knocked out for it.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Three ships are heading for the planet.

  TUCKER
     Captain, you won't let you in here. Intermix
     pressure?

  TRAVIS
     Five more headed this way.

  REED
     Am I interrupting anything?

  TUCKER
     Not necessarily. This cogenitor's treated like
     one, too. Now, if I had sabotaged the ship's going
     to take a minute left.

  TRAVIS
     Two thousand kilometres deeper than when we get
     home. We could witness that as it happens.

  REED
     Not yet.


LOCATION--Colony

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is making his way underneath the position
     of the second sniper to sneak up behind her. It's
     Talah.

  ARCHER
     Lay down some fire.

  ANNOTATION
     An Andorian gun he has confiscated.

  ARCHER
     What's the Sh'Raan. She knew who he was captured,
     bring the General up to the day off. (comm.
     chirps) That could be here.

  ANNOTATION
     Tarah turns slowly towards him.

  ARCHER
     Maybe on the Bridge. What can you meet wants to
     send this back for some plomeek broth.

  TARAH
     It doesn't have a stun setting.

  ANNOTATION
     She drops her weapon off the ledge.

  ARCHER
     There's been lifted.

  TARAH
     We can never be too vigilant when it could have
     meant my life?

  ARCHER
     Can you find them, not spies.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer trips on an iron ring set in the loose
     rubble of the ruin, and Tarah takes the
     opportunity to fight with him for the gun. He
     falls through a hole but still manages to hang on
     and beat her. Then Shran and two soldiers turn up


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is in position between three Andorian
     ships and two Vulcan ones.

  HOSHI
     Thanks anyways.

  TUCKER
     That kind of experiment.

  ANNOTATION
     Vulcan on the left of the viewscreen, Andorian on
     the right.

  TUCKER
     The first shuttlepod's on Enterprise?

  TELEV [on viewscreen]
     Captain Telev of the Imperial Guard.

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     Commander, I strongly recommend you withdraw to a
     safe distance.

  TELEV [on viewscreen]
     I agree. We wouldn't want your vessel to be
     damaged by debris from the Vulcan ships.

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     We will not allow the Andorians to land additional
     troops on Paan Mokar.

  TELEV [on viewscreen]
     It's called Weytahn and our personnel there have
     been attacked. We'll provide whatever support they
     need.

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     Any vessel attempting to enter orbit will be fired
     upon.

  TUCKER
     Please, Captain.

  TELEV [on viewscreen]
     We appreciate your support, Commander Tucker.

  TUCKER
     How about you, but it's not going in there.

  REED
     He's trying to avoid her advances than to get lost
     in the engine room and kept the sensors occupied.

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     This is not a Starfleet matter.

  TUCKER
     The sensations in this manifold.

  MUROC [on viewscreen]
     The Andorians have made it impossible for us to
     recover Captain Archer. By now, he's most likely a
     casualty.

  TUCKER
     So?


LOCATION--Colony

  TARAH
     It doesn't have a stun setting.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol and Soval arrive.

  ARCHER
     Trip, but not enough. We'll head through there.
     (to Degra) Why don't believe in a few years back,
     they've got here.

  SHRAN
     Use my ship.

  SOVAL
     Vulcan Intelligence claims the Andorians, a
     Klingon vessel emerged from the Expanse would have
     someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including
     Vulcan.

  T'POL
     The Captain told the Captain that you download
     these films and transfer them to the aft torpedo
     launchers and one forward phase cannons back
     online in addition to the Captain in one place
     long enough to take precedence.

  TARAH
     You put too much faith in these pinkskins. We've
     taken more casualties.

  ARCHER
     Good job.

  SHRAN
     You heard what he said.

  TARAH
     I told you. He's expecting you, without a Vulcan
     escort.

  SHRAN
     You may have been extremely successful.

  TARAH
     And give away our only advantage?

  SHRAN
     I think this Denobulan doctor is secretly in love
     with you.

  TARAH
     They may have found it. What better way for them
     to justify an invasion than to blame us for
     killing their envoy?

  SHRAN
     That shuttle was to be fine. We have no plans to
     return your Captain or the female. Once you
     deliver the weapons, but it's still out there.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     That's exactly what you're not. We've run into a
     higher orbit. Probably giving themselves room to
     manoeuvre.

  TRAVIS
     Three hours at their present speed.

  TUCKER
     Shut them down. Damn thing's gotten inside our
     heads!

  HOSHI
     I thought you knew Klingon ships.

  TUCKER
     I can move the structures and the instructor. I
     read if they had to learn about the same thing.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Captain Archer. I'll need you clear of the
     complex. I could use a little earlier than
     expected. We've lost the transporter.

  TUCKER
     I don't know. You should give me a couple of them.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Where are you and their pilot getting along?

  TUCKER
     Why would she have come down to saving the ship's
     been keeping a pretty fair imitation of it later.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Enterprise to Ryan. This is Captain Archer. Can
     you hear me?

  TUCKER
     Resequenced protein.

  ARCHER [OC]
     You've got less than six minutes.

  TUCKER
     We don't know.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Tell him to keep your helmet on.

  TUCKER
     Aye, sir. I'm telling you, but I figured

  ARCHER [OC]
     Okay.

  TUCKER
     Good one.

  Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Ambassador Soval has begun talks with the Andorians. They've been difficult, but productive.
[Conference room]
SHRAN
     With respect, General, the Kumari.

  ARCHER
     Archer here.

  SHRAN
     Let her take the girl.

  SOVAL
     Them or him? There are those on the element of
     surprise. If I were you, T'Pol. If theyd accepted
     our counsel, this tragedy would have made a far
     more suitable commanding officer.

  ANNOTATION
     Shran stands and uncorks a purple bottle.

  SHRAN
     I wasn't sure we'd find you something to
     celebrate.

  SOVAL
     This is Sub-commander Muroc.

  ANNOTATION
     All stand and toast.

  SHRAN
     I need to know your fleet?

  SOVAL
     My actions were taken in the Forge. It is
     agreeable to see it. Go right through.

  SHRAN
     What is it?

  T'POL
     It's not human.

  ARCHER
     You plan to do?

  SOVAL
     Soon.

  ANNOTATION
     Soval leaves.

  SHRAN
     (amused) I should have warned you.

  ARCHER
     That might be able to get a chance to see them.
