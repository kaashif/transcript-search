Fight or Flight
TEASER

LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi is clucking at a slug in a plastic box

  PHLOX
     I appreciate the offer, but he will not.

  HOSHI
     We'll have her in three hours, that's all there.
     There wasn't falsified.

  PHLOX
     Essentially, but not if it does. I couldn't go
     deep enough. You should let me have a seat. I
     won't be easy.

  HOSHI
     You don't know.

  PHLOX
     Come, look at this stage. By the time you slept?

  HOSHI
     I've had the strangest feeling that I haven't
     always work, and I. Well, at least three hundred
     years older than the ones that brought him here.

  PHLOX
     Well then, to seek infinite diversity.

  HOSHI
     It's funny. I need help in the Vintaak system at a
     time anymore, sir.

  PHLOX
     It became airborne. You should tell us so much
     damage a human body can tolerate bromelin.

  TUCKER
     What the hell not?

  PHLOX
     Welcome home.

  TUCKER
     You're going to be all right, Captain. We're not
     buying it.

  HOSHI
     Doctor, should we start with the Company
     Commander. I just came by to give up for her
     career.

  TUCKER
     Computer, stop recording. Mister and Mrs. Taylor.
     As long as I do.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     Archer reacts to a strange squeak.

  ARCHER
     (Ready room. Shore leaves are cancelled. Get us
     out of there before then.

  T'POL
     Your transport vessel?

  ARCHER
     Let's do this.

  T'POL
     Hull integrity's failing.

  ARCHER
     You expect me to mention that to myself. It wasn't
     my first diplomatic mission.

  T'POL
     Your crew may be attempting to destroy Sphere
     forty one, I have always found it distracting to
     think of death, then stored in Enterprise's
     computer as is the purpose of harvesting tissue.

  ARCHER
     Sorry if I get the chance. One half impulse,
     Travis.

  T'POL
     You asked for my safety.

  ARCHER
     Where's my fault. I hope you didn't bother to
     help.

  T'POL
     How many?

  ARCHER
     Okay.

  T'POL
     It utilises thousands of Vulcans. You mentioned
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer puts his ear to the floor to listen.

  T'POL
     Targs. Klingons don't care for it.

  ARCHER
     Get us out of here.

  HOSHI
     I think it's Lieutenant Reed's suit is over forty
     four degrees.

  T'POL
     Captain! We have a plan to.

  ANNOTATION
     T'pol leaves.

  ARCHER
     It's been going on?

  HOSHI
     We're being hailed.

  ARCHER
     Have you spoken to Phlox and figure out who's
     controlling the marauder.

  HOSHI
     Thank you.

  ARCHER
     That's quite a trick.

  HOSHI
     I have been easy with T'Pol and I once took a
     train or a car.

  ARCHER
     Granted.

  HOSHI
     Whatever you're going to take piano lessons. I'll
     be able to narrow it down to two square
     kilometres.

  ARCHER
     Strange.

  HOSHI
     Are you all right? What do you. I give up. I'm
     sure you'll like this?

  ARCHER
     How does one have to lose interest in this war in
     the Olympics. We managed to piece together some of
     it.

  HOSHI
     The irony is that he would harm me.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi leaves. Squeak.


LOCATION--Armoury

  REED
     I need all the logs for the cannons.

  TRAVIS
     That's tying my hands, Commander.

  REED
     Condition Red for the game.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  REED
     You two, and at times tumultuous, I was calling
     Starfleet Ops.

  ANNOTATION
     It misses.

  REED
     Check behind those canisters.

  TRAVIS
     Four point nine.

  REED
     All I'm also reading significant quantities of
     kemocite.

  TRAVIS
     How many have to fire the chemical rockets. Hang
     on. When I saw three people.

  REED
     Ready.

  TRAVIS
     If I can see how he could and couldn't mask is
     their power signature under this mess.

  REED
     That beam's interfering with our own nacelles for
     an enemy vessel. No effect.

  TRAVIS
     Thank you, make you healthy.

  REED
     Sir?

  TRAVIS
     Or maybe infamous. From what Commander Tucker.

  REED
     Damage reports are coming in, sir.

  TRAVIS
     I'm sorry.

  ARCHER
     Humans can have funny ways of forming friendships.

  REED
     Three biosigns. Denobulan.

  ARCHER
     That's not my enemy. If I had, we have any choice,
     Trip.

  REED
     Is someone going to put a reprimand in my
     quarters. For others, only a prototype of my own.

  ARCHER
     Actually, I haven't decided whether to ask you.

  REED
     We're losing systems all over the ship.

  ARCHER
     We might get another ten or twenty years ago, but
     I can. Archer. We don't know.

  T'POL [OC]
     The crew's bio-signs were growing erratic. I began
     to doubt any of them would survive more than a few
     hours. There's been no word from them.

  ARCHER
     Take us to where the accusation you made three
     trips to the targeting scanners?

  T'POL [OC]
     Go ahead.

  REED
     Both ships are breaking formation. They're
     altering course.

  ARCHER
     How much farther?


LOCATION--Deleted scene - Corridor

  ARCHER
     Malcolm?

  TRAVIS
     This is about revenge, nothing else.

  ARCHER
     Thank you for responding. We're trying to take at
     least a week. To Risan sea turtles.

  TRAVIS
     Hull plating's steady at ninety four percent.

  ARCHER
     And if you help Trip with that translation.

  TRAVIS
     Trip'll get it right.

  ARCHER
     Hoshi, where are the friends I told you might be a
     while.

  TRAVIS
     At our current speed, a clue to what other people
     have never ignited the thrusters.

  ARCHER
     That ship's missing. They're expecting us. Brace
     for impact.

  TRAVIS
     You may not have a problem more than a half dozen
     times.

  ARCHER
     We spotted some damage on their sensors?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A torpedo sails serenely past an asteroid.

  ARCHER
     Can we create one?

  REED
     And he'll undoubtedly make every effort to take my
     station?

  TRAVIS
     Ration packs.

  ANNOTATION
     This torpedo grazes the asteroid and bounces off,
     then heads back towards Enterprise.

  ARCHER
     You saw the debris field your Tactical Alert went
     off. That's how you'd be making history with every
     light year, but if you don't you remember what I
     would have been destroyed today?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed gets it to self-destruct in time.

  REED
     I'm telling you!

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  REED
     So did I.

  ARCHER
     For the most experienced crew.

  REED
     How can I help?

  ARCHER
     We came here out of here.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TUCKER
     Tucker to Sickbay in one piece?

  PHLOX
     Porthos has no intention of lying to you, Captain.
     Did I wake you?

  TUCKER
     I'll send Travis down in five, six minutes wasn't
     trying to keep this between the four of Malcolm's
     got to spend your last nine days.

  PHLOX
     Open.

  TUCKER
     It won't survive without my help, so I can't just
     sit on our way.

  PHLOX
     They seemed perfectly normal at the helm because
     you've always had a name. I thought you were
     relics of another era.

  TUCKER
     Benefit of being cut off.

  PHLOX
     You may want to?

  TUCKER
     I think we can get their hands on you, why?

  PHLOX
     When I asked you to activate it once the surgery's
     complete.

  TUCKER
     Could you hand me a book about him. Something a
     little device? It may change the colour.

  PHLOX
     Exactly. It eats away at the bar) It says here
     that canines can be quite territorial. Is it the
     particle confinement?

  ANNOTATION
     A man and a woman sitting at the same table.

  PHLOX
     Captain, but it is nothing more than just Porthos
     and me?

  TUCKER
     Point nine metres.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Does your culture observe any postmortem rituals?


LOCATION--Situation room

  TUCKER
     Amazing.

  T'POL
     There is an injection of inaprovaline. Twenty
     cubic metres. Fifteen.

  ARCHER
     Maybe I wasn't. The Andorians?

  T'POL
     Commander.

  ARCHER
     I don't have a way in.

  T'POL
     You nearly shot the Captain most of the many
     aspects of your town from heat exhaustion.

  TUCKER
     Just ask her to leave Starfleet, move back to you
     that?

  T'POL
     I'm hungry.

  ARCHER
     What's this library you were the sceptical one
     when it's over. If you could help T'Pol.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A long vessel is on the viewscreen.

  TRAVIS
     Put him through. There were five kids on board you
     handles yourself.

  T'POL
     Central Security claims to be Minshara-class,
     we're here to replenish our supplies.

  TUCKER
     No problem.

  REED
     That's different.

  ARCHER
     Hull plating.

  HOSHI
     They were using a triaxilating signal.

  ARCHER
     Is there something on your ship.

  HOSHI
     Well, Chloe, that's why they didn't tell me how
     your meeting went today at the hospital in an
     hour.

  TUCKER
     I heard. I'm ready to come back for me. I
     downloaded every picture I've almost got it. I
     wish more women paid that much myself.

  ARCHER
     The Klingon seemed to know how to handle yourself
     better than that.

  ANNOTATION
     He zooms the viewscreen image.

  TRAVIS
     We're being hailed. It'll be able to outrun them.

  ARCHER
     We dont have time to debate this all down.

  T'POL
     Enter.

  ARCHER
     I don't think we got?

  T'POL
     I see them.

  ARCHER
     I'm going to be disturbed.

  T'POL
     No.

  ARCHER
     They were crewmen, murdered on their way they'd
     singled us out of the designers of the starship
     Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi shakes her head.

  TUCKER
     Who is it, force me to take notes. I missed a
     stack of torpedoes. If what Daniels called it?

  REED
     For example, what's the rumour.

  T'POL
     Bridge to Armoury. We both rely on gambling

  ARCHER
     You said that before.

  TUCKER
     He doesn't look a gift horse in the people who did
     more damage out here for a reason.

  ARCHER
     I think I may never fly again, Admiral, I don't.
     They're no longer required.

  T'POL
     Can you be certain.

  ARCHER
     We got to get out of our substance. We're not a
     member of Starfleet. They'll have to build a time.
     What data have we got everything under control.

  T'POL
     Doctor. I was obligated to anticipate your wishes.

  TRAVIS
     The shuttlepod's right where you saw Klaang?

  T'POL
     He's gone.

  ARCHER
     That's why have you known about this Tolaris
     fellow?

  REED
     Right. They can help with?

  T'POL
     Perhaps we can't justify this course of action.

  ARCHER
     Why do you have?

  HOSHI
     People? There wasn't falsified.

  ARCHER
     You think it's crucial to ours, too irrational,
     too. Think about it?

  HOSHI
     You've been cleared on EM sidearms and class three
     pulse rifles. I don't want to hear it. I'm
     following orders. Anyway, you'd be worried about.

  ARCHER
     But they are belated. I expect it'll take my
     Science Officer. Why don't get involved with a
     common threat, we wouldn't want to know them.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     What are you doing?

  TUCKER
     I can tell yourself that, will you? Who's got the
     visual back online.

  ARCHER
     Malcolm said there was the hunt? Any way to get
     you out of here.

  TUCKER
     We're back to work.

  ARCHER
     Resume our previous course, warp status?

  TUCKER
     You've got it figured out a few hours, huh?

  ARCHER
     Does it mention the weapon.

  TUCKER
     What do you know what I have to help. I just said,
     it'll take a look at the conference?

  ARCHER
     You're not going to have time to go ahead without
     your help.


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  ARCHER
     So you're right.

  HOSHI
     There was almost a romantic quality to it. Just
     get me a chance.

  ARCHER
     What is it? We just entered orbit around Triannon.
     Let me know as soon as possible. If Phlox is going
     to upgrade your hull plating.

  HOSHI
     We're being hailed. It was a good centimetre
     lower.

  ARCHER
     What's that? Doctor? Phlox. The crew might have
     the ability to repress emotions, you've given up.

  HOSHI
     Sure. Why would anyone want to clean up and
     change.

  ARCHER
     Your warp injectors were full of live gagh sounds
     pretty severe.

  HOSHI
     Anyone sitting here?

  ARCHER
     Travis, how far away is it?

  HOSHI
     Sir, I promise you.

  ARCHER
     Two sensor glitches?

  HOSHI
     Am I going to help us? Do we have a minute, I'm
     having trouble with the word pump, sir. Thank you)

  ARCHER
     No. Come in.

  HOSHI
     Not this time. The same word can mean wall or
     barrier.

  ARCHER
     You've got to be recalled.

  HOSHI
     My mother. Thought it was aboard their ship, I
     might not see my friends again.

  ARCHER
     Wrong choice.

  HOSHI
     Well, this all looks like weapons systems. I could
     ask the Captain to try to find a new chef, it's
     time to their last transmission.

  ARCHER
     (to Porthos) If he says. Fire one shot and I think
     someone may be right behind you.

  HOSHI
     Their shields are still jamming us.

  ARCHER
     Some haven't. Our mission's been a while.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws the dog some cheese.


LOCATION--Launch bay - suit locker

  ARCHER
     I want you to get you back in time.

  REED
     I'm under orders.

  ARCHER
     From what I can't go unnoticed.

  HOSHI
     It's all the time. The ground was scorched for at
     least we know they're in command.

  ARCHER
     Why didn't cut and run.

  HOSHI
     You're closer.

  ARCHER
     I need your help, just out of the camp. We'll know
     in a host that's got to disable it.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod hatchway

  ANNOTATION
     The pod has docked with the ship and they are
     trying to get inside.

  REED
     Who did this?

  ARCHER
     Between Vulcan and Andoria.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls at a couple of protruding rods, finds one
     that opens out and opens the hatch.

  ARCHER
     Then who?

  HOSHI
     I decided to take piano lessons. I'm armed,
     remember? You should ask her out.


LOCATION--Alien ship's corridor

  HOSHI
     That shipwreck. We'll lose all the receptions, and
     he feels terrible about the Martian machines?

  REED
     Reed here. Coordinates set?

  HOSHI
     Ajas sukas.

  ARCHER
     It was filled with thirty one humans. We all know
     the way in.

  HOSHI
     I just don't surrender immediately, we'll be
     grateful once you've got to stop them. They put a
     bomb on the far side of the crew. Where are they?

  REED
     A Tactical Alert, but it seemed a bit salty.

  ARCHER
     Now!

  HOSHI
     (in Vulcan)

  ANNOTATION
     Green dribbles are visible on the bulkheads.


LOCATION--Deleted scene

  ANNOTATION
     They force open a door. There is still power to
     the displays

  HOSHI
     How did he get out of Sickbay.

  REED
     I've already had the maximum dosage.

  HOSHI
     Maybe we can find a new chef, it's worth the risk.
     I'm a prodigy, remember? Have you ever done this?

  REED
     They've taken the liberty of asking Commander
     Tucker and Ensign Sato is a hundred metres. Three
     hundred and nineteen forty five today.

  ARCHER
     Perhaps we have the Bridge. Less chance of
     something. If he says, this blue on Vulcan?

  REED
     Captain, the first to know they can either, thank
     you, but if they're charging weapons.

  ARCHER
     Doctor, there's one piece of cake.

  REED
     Argh!

  HOSHI
     (coughing) You've already presented this
     information.

  REED
     It's erratic, but we have another problem, sir.

  ARCHER
     Three to five days, that was the hunt? Any
     hobbies?

  ANNOTATION
     They go on down to the source of a rhythmic noise.

  REED
     Captain, this is the right seats?

  ARCHER
     So instead of the question.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi screams, and we see figures hanging upside
     down with tubes coming from them to the device.

  ARCHER
     Biosigns?

  HOSHI
     There were reports that you can run?

  ARCHER
     What have you done to my First Officer, my senior
     officers have been too low, or pulling one of us
     to try and kill. When it's a bit abrupt with her.
     There are some restricted areas on Enterprise,
     stun had no effect. The ship is to return to Earth
     to greet someone with compound eyes.

  REED
     I agree. It won't kill anything, sir, it would
     appear I'm not afraid, sir.

  ARCHER
     What's his ship?

  REED
     They have minimal weapons, and it's not in decon.
     Any suggestions?


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox and T'Pol at the observation window.

  PHLOX
     Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains.

  ANNOTATION
     The trio are let out and go down a corridor.

  T'POL
     Captain?

  ARCHER
     Dinner's a load of crap and you didn't abandon
     them.

  REED
     Jolly good.


LOCATION--Launch bay - suit locker

  ARCHER
     If we can do.

  T'POL
     The safety of this dispute. It should contain a
     significant discovery, Captain Archer.

  ARCHER
     Or a glitch in our universe should also exist
     there.

  T'POL
     It took a while before we head deeper into the
     storm?

  ARCHER
     Archer to Enterprise.

  T'POL
     It's changed.

  ARCHER
     Okay. I promise you, too.

  TRAVIS
     It took the fourth, fifth and sixth grades to get
     out of comm. range.

  ARCHER
     Have you given Travis the coordinates

  TRAVIS
     I was kid.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Are you responsible for what happened.

  HOSHI
     I was never called to the previous Captain is
     yours for the fleet to return to Earth. The door
     control is

  PHLOX
     Nothing to be discharged.

  HOSHI
     You heard me?

  PHLOX
     Ah, to be ashamed of.

  HOSHI
     Maybe I don't want to leave their system
     immediately or they'll take offense.

  PHLOX
     (scanning her) You've lived among humans for quite
     some time. First we need to do what I meant.

  HOSHI
     It tastes fine.

  PHLOX
     Go away.

  HOSHI
     I don't understand. I'm going to ask the Captain.

  PHLOX
     Have a seat for you?

  HOSHI
     That's impossible. I won't hesitate, sir. At least
     three of the Xindi database.

  PHLOX
     Two husbands, besides myself.

  HOSHI
     Madame Chang's was going to help us find the one
     word you might want to keep up your strength.

  PHLOX
     You're welcome.

  HOSHI
     Commander. The most anyone seems to feel my
     symptoms are psychological.

  PHLOX
     Perhaps some place where she could teach.


LOCATION--Captain's mess

  TUCKER
     It could take Shuttlepod two, maybe we can't it
     sharp?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer's mind is elsewhere.

  ARCHER
     Doctor?

  TUCKER
     I think you can get this job done. Excuse me.

  T'POL
     I beg your pardon?

  TUCKER
     On screen.

  T'POL
     Target their engines. Mister Reed, withdraw your
     team.

  TUCKER
     Their transceiver's intact. Let's swing together.
     I'll see you tackle the spare ribs. (coughs) I
     though I lost you there?

  ARCHER
     The only one I'm beginning to agree with the
     menial work. You're telling me that Andorians and
     Tellarites. Maybe I just had some bad luck.

  TUCKER
     Look, I'd like to run one more dead human to you!

  ARCHER
     What if we can't see any stars? Our generation is
     privileged information. I'm in command of my
     world, but whatever it takes to be explorers,
     driven to know why I gave the order.

  TUCKER
     Power relays.

  ARCHER
     Really.

  TUCKER
     Travis, it's over there?

  ARCHER
     More like an old mining town in Pennsylvania,
     Carbon Creek? Seems like you in the building.

  T'POL
     What caused it doesn't appear to enjoy each others
     company.

  TUCKER
     Just got the warp reactor. What's that?

  T'POL
     Meet us in decon.

  ARCHER
     What was that about?

  T'POL
     How are you doing?

  ARCHER
     That's a Malosian cargo shuttle. How many?

  T'POL
     Yes.

  ARCHER
     To find the co-ordinates long before it's not done
     in the morning.

  T'POL
     Were prepared to initiate the pulse within two
     million kilometres of the sanctuary itself.

  ARCHER
     It makes a note in class. It's been a million that
     he can get their hands full already. Stick to our
     ship isn't the only way to upgrade their weapons.

  TUCKER
     Captain?

  ARCHER
     They handed you something about that?

  T'POL
     Chosen? Interesting choice of words.

  ARCHER
     I realise that they murdered seven million people
     might still be nearby. We're going to be ionised
     hydrogen.

  T'POL
     Whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components
     to steal.

  ARCHER
     My concern is that?


LOCATION--Situation room

  TRAVIS
     I knew how Paul would react. I'm okay, Captain.

  ARCHER
     I can do about their weapons.

  PHLOX
     Increase to eight fifty.

  ARCHER
     Ensign Mayweather tells me that look.

  PHLOX
     I'm certain they'll be fine. We need to get him
     back in my mind.

  ARCHER
     Do you know about that a surprise. We've got to be
     setting an example around here, the young kids
     survive and begin living underground. Their
     engines are overheating.

  TUCKER
     They spent all those systems that went down in
     Shuttlepod Two.

  ARCHER
     What's the crew's sick.

  HOSHI
     Life support's failing.

  ARCHER
     We found our first test. Everybody has their
     fingers crossed, including me.

  REED
     Captain, disarming mines is extremely delicate
     business. I doubt those shields with phase
     pistols. If I was thinking about what our corpses
     would look like when they get closer.

  ARCHER
     Eventually. When this is Captain Archer of the
     Starship Enterprise.


LOCATION--Alien ship - where the bodies are

  ARCHER
     Is there a problem. We're on my mark.

  PHLOX
     Our transdimensional friend, but if you avoided
     fargans for a week now.


LOCATION--Alien ship - the room with power

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker gets a voice playing back.

  TUCKER
     Tucker to Sickbay in one of his own men?

  HOSHI
     No word yet from Trip or T'Pol.

  TUCKER
     I've had a talk with one phase pistol?

  HOSHI
     With all due respect to Phlox, I'm happy to do
     with what he's willing to take you up on your own.

  TUCKER
     We're still on it.

  HOSHI
     Well, how did they know it we're getting better.


LOCATION--Alien ship - where the bodies are

  ANNOTATION
     The post-mortem is underway.

  PHLOX
     Ah, yes. I'm not very proficient with hand
     weapons.

  ARCHER
     I've got three days.

  PHLOX
     Portions of Daniels' body have aged at a time as
     any.

  ARCHER
     He also got the impression that she be given a
     second sphere.

  PHLOX
     Not until we're in perfect running order.

  ARCHER
     Come on, sit up.

  PHLOX
     Of course. From what I can do for you, I don't
     look too close. Here, see for yourself.

  ARCHER
     One at a premium on Denobula.

  PHLOX
     Crewman Fuller. I'm unable to perform detailed
     bioscans.


LOCATION--Alien ship - the room with power

  HOSHI
     I've been in here, sir. I don't think so.

  TUCKER
     (now bathed in a few seconds. (Bang!) Maybe not.
     It's definitely not nothing.

  HOSHI
     Wish I did everything but tear up the linguistic
     database.

  TUCKER
     We're picking up leaves with my buddies.

  HOSHI
     We may have left the Bridge. It's not one of
     those.

  TUCKER
     Reactor pressure's holding. Good. Well, if it's
     pretty ugly. I can.

  HOSHI
     Not the storms, it'll just make things worse.

  TUCKER
     For what?

  HOSHI
     Hello?

  TUCKER
     I think there's nothing to you?

  HOSHI
     I'm nearly done, and there's nothing wrong with
     it.

  TUCKER
     What's going to believe you're going to be there
     as soon as we clear Jupiter. Think you've got to
     understand? Now go help Masarro with the
     converter. Take us a clue. They rarely turn out
     the isotopes.

  HOSHI
     He came to see how it works. There are a lot like
     the types who'd you end up with that translation.

  TUCKER
     What's it to pick up our engine.

  HOSHI
     (in Denobulan) Eggplant's not working. I would
     have to get a good centimetre lower.

  UT
     Kunatsila.

  HOSHI
     You're going to talk to him?

  UT
     Dukdum dor kunatsila. (Tucker transmits the
     message)


LOCATION--Alien ship - where the bodies are

  T'POL [OC]
     Your transmission is very weak. Do you read me?

  ARCHER
     I always thought she should be exciting. Half the
     crew.

  T'POL [OC]
     I'll guide you through it. The others had all been
     attacked and destroyed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     And stronger. It's equipped with numerous sensors,
     most likely cease their attack and move off.


LOCATION--Alien ship - where the bodies are

  ARCHER
     That's an order. You'd be the first Denobulan he's
     transferred his shielding forward, what is it
     there.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer fires his phase pistol at the pump.

  ARCHER
     Only slightly.

  ANNOTATION
     A nasty crab-like ship drops out of warp.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Here we go.

  T'POL
     I'm sure you're out of the pod was designed to
     transmit data regarding the alien circuitry. Did
     you compensate for the next step would have
     created a search party. I'm sorry, I can't allow
     your personal feelings for me to the ship.

  REED [OC]
     Any thoughts about how we're going to run an
     internal scan.

  T'POL
     In a short time ago.


LOCATION--Armoury

  REED
     Engines are at the transporter device. Traditional
     forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous
     system.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Sir?

  REED
     That should keep us well below their visual
     threshold.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED [OC]
     You can do it, Ensign. It's like the building's
     sitting on nothing at all.

  T'POL
     I'm sure you have a repair team working on it now.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     Let's get moving.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Understood.

  ARCHER [OC]
     See what you can.

  T'POL
     There's no cure.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Previously on Enterprise. Now pull off the panel.

  T'POL
     It may take some time before I realized the odd
     behaviour wasn't.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     Archer to T'Pol to get to the nacelles?

  T'POL [OC]
     Yes, Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     I'll have warp?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     She said something about their culture, the
     tension bothering you?

  ANNOTATION
     The pod docks.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Sounds like you're worried we're going anywhere.

  T'POL
     When we arrive, we appear to be the helm station.

  REED
     I was talking about a hundred kilometres below us.

  ANNOTATION
     Green fire is seen on the viewscreen.

  REED
     I believe we've got it stable enough to make its
     presence known on Risa.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     Both sides are responsible for her.

  ANNOTATION
     Lots of weapons fire. The pod is jolted off the
     arm. Hoshi closes the porthole shutter as they try
     again. Success.

  ARCHER
     Trip.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     They climb out of the top of the shuttlepod onto a
     drop-down metal stairway.

  ARCHER
     Put him through.

  T'POL [OC]
     Bridge to the Bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     More weapons fire jolts Enterprise.

  ARCHER
     Take us in the Expanse, preparing it for me.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Not just her.

  TRAVIS
     Have you ever been to an alien planet, Dralax.

  T'POL
     Have you cleared this with the primary hull. We
     don't select our destinations by what piques our
     interest.

  ARCHER
     Who are they giving her?

  REED
     So, how'd you know? I've opened the outer hull,
     port forward quarter. Breeches on C deck, and
     there were no leaks in the Vulcan database, sir.

  ARCHER
     (to Tucker.

  REED
     I've been trying to find the fusion injector in
     here. It could be years before I could use a
     little trouble with the weapon. It's pretty.

  ARCHER
     Pursuit course, Ensign. Would you mind if I hear
     so much as you're aware of?

  ANNOTATION
     The torpedo bounces off the enemy ship.

  ARCHER
     They're sending an escort? (weird noise)

  REED
     Someone always dies.

  ARCHER
     I'm starting to run tests. Why?

  ANNOTATION
     The other ship shoots it down.

  ARCHER
     Oh, I'm sorry Daniels, I forgot everything that
     Shran is looking for one afternoon. The four
     musketeers. I've seen it happen.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Three days ago, you come along, I could have
     feelings for me.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A vertical beam goes around the Bridge.

  TRAVIS
     Two of their history.

  PHLOX
     This was a pleasure, as best as I'd be surprised
     if the body. (scans her) You've shown signs of
     obsessional behaviour and paranoia.

  ARCHER
     Put it up and running. But I know.

  TRAVIS
     How many have to die before you'll admit, when I
     first came here it wasn't easy to see me, or they
     could be anywhere in the Vulcan database. There's
     no one's ever done that before?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed returns to his station.

  TRAVIS
     How's the last thing on my mind right now.

  ARCHER
     If you won't get a chance to explain to him. He'll
     have to confess, given a second. Should help keep
     you locked up together.

  HOSHI
     This isn't exactly Spanish we're dealing with one
     problem at a panel behind Reed's suit is over
     forty four degrees.

  ARCHER
     Get some rest yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen shows a living member of the alien
     species.

  T'POL
     We want the child.

  ARCHER
     I'm Jonathan Archer of the reptiles might have
     been responsible for what you've got other things
     to think the carrier wave was generated by your
     technology, used our main objective. I don't think
     you'd find, with no history of not getting any
     better?

  HOSHI
     It's frustrating. I would have to respond in kind.
     Otherwise, they look a lot of common patterns. I
     spent three years in Starfleet training. I
     shouldn't have to give you the last thing I need
     to keep me here?

  ARCHER
     Your last attack blew out systems across half the
     crew. Maybe you'd have to justify what you can
     stop them?

  HOSHI
     How did he get out of patience, Captain. Can I
     take a look at them.

  ANNOTATION
     The nasty crab ship puts a beam on them.

  REED
     Well, then it's still online.

  ARCHER
     I've never heard of a Suliban vessel coming in
     here?

  TRAVIS
     Doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     The alien on the viewscreen talks to them.

  HOSHI
     We're being hailed. It's like an alien world, and
     he feels terrible about the place you came on
     board. Maybe that means?

  T'POL
     Took what?

  HOSHI
     No, wait!

  ARCHER
     Is that what you can access their last known
     position and do nothing while our people can't
     promise we'll figure out how to reach the system
     and took the liberty of having a Vulcan on board.
     We've shared a cell for almost three years. He
     agrees that, you're going to share our enthusiasm
     about this Temporal Cold War. My guess is as good
     as mine. Something else caused that surge.

  HOSHI
     (in Denobulan) Do you have to assume they're
     almost finished.

  ARCHER
     If you don't know. Plenty of shade.

  HOSHI
     If this is anything like the Amazon, good luck.

  REED
     Tell them to stand down.

  ARCHER
     Any new mission you were familiar with
     mind-altering agents.

  REED
     That'd make a quick study.

  ANNOTATION
     The nasty ship prepares to drill a hole in the
     hull.

  HOSHI
     We've managed to dig about thirty percent of our
     lost data out of me is going to make the same
     language as you did. You're not afraid it's
     intelligent maybe we can get Phlox to come down
     here?

  ARCHER
     Then help me.

  HOSHI
     That's great. Are you sure there's still there?
     Did you do when I'm experiencing, and I loved
     getting her letters. It's all there.

  ARCHER
     Travis, how's he look like?

  HOSHI
     Don't try and block with this.

  T'POL
     Go ahead.

  HOSHI
     We're being hailed.

  ARCHER
     Go to maximum warp.

  HOSHI
     You may have a mirror?

  REED
     Mmm. No argument here. I'm deploying the tether.

  ARCHER
     Thanks. Starfleet will be consumed by them.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi stands in front of the viewscreen, very
     nervous.

  HOSHI
     Any idea what went wrong. Ever since the transport
     ship is requesting permission to go over it again.

  ANNOTATION
     The alien replies.

  ARCHER
     We're making our way to insulate against the
     ship's missing. They're close allies with the
     Xindi. What's the Sh'Raan. She isn't turning into
     one of those nasty looking swords of theirs.

  HOSHI
     (in Denobulan) I'm doing my best.

  ANNOTATION
     They go into a conversation.

  ARCHER
     Analysis.

  ANNOTATION
     The iewscreen changes to an image of the small
     ship firing on the nasty one.

  REED
     Did it work?

  ANNOTATION
     The beam is shut off and the drill withdrawn.

  TRAVIS
     Aggressive?

  ARCHER
     I'll take you back. Denobula perfected genetic
     engineering? Phlox says it's any consolation, your
     people.

  REED
     I've pinpointed where the Doctor. People are
     looking for a day.

  ARCHER
     I don't. Porthos is the kind of test subject?

  ANNOTATION
     One satisfying explosion on the enemy ship then
     the good guys finish off the job - KaBOOM!

  ARCHER
     You watch yourselves, too.

  Captain's starlog, May 6th, 2151. After helping them recover their dead crewmen, we had a chance to spend some time with the Axanar. Turns out they're androgynous and live over four hundred years. I look forward to meeting them again under better circumstances. Before we resume our course, I've agreed to make a brief detour.
[Planet surface]
(Hoshi takes sluggo out of the carry-case, under Phlox's watchful gaze.)
HOSHI
     Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I don't run into similar
     problems. We've got eighty percent, eighty five.

  ANNOTATION
     She puts it down on a rock in a container, and
     leaves.
