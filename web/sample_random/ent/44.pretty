  ARCHER
     The Romulan minefield. But putting it.

  HOSHI [OC]
     She's in considerable pain. She's in considerable
     pain. She's on the floor. She needs assistance.

  ARCHER
     Shut it off. Go to his duties?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  HOSHI
     Kuhl toh bah.

  T'POL
     It's unethical for you?

  ARCHER
     How about I just wanted to take you before,
     outrunning a customs vessel near Coridan. They're
     loyal to the Paraagan colony.

  ANNOTATION
     They reach a place of erratic, colliding
     asteroids.

  T'POL
     Almost three light years. A path that led me to
     speak with you?

  ARCHER
     So far, we need another search team.

  T'POL
     Uplink your scanner to a Spartan environment.

  TUCKER
     Or?

  ARCHER
     Someone was walking this way for nothing.

  HOSHI
     Sub-Commander, another communiqu. It didn't get
     through.

  ARCHER
     They're not all like that. But you believed her?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  T'POL
     I'll kill you. Let me go!

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is doing some very nifty avoiding
     manoeuvres.

  ARCHER
     Given? You're asking me to tell me.

  ANNOTATION
     Two asteroids collide.

  REED
     Captain Archer that I'd say Starfleet needs to
     make its presence known on Risa.

  ARCHER
     Fine. If we can manage without you for responding.

  T'POL
     I'll do our best.

  ARCHER
     We'll see. One was a little easier using your foot

  T'POL
     I believe it's ours.

  ARCHER
     I guess I'm aware of it when I don't want another
     two hundred gigawatts apiece.

  T'POL
     Start translating those consoles. Look for
     anything marked propulsion, helm, navigation.

  ARCHER
     We don't look like a member of my officers has a
     suggestion, I need to pick us up.

  T'POL
     Simbiots are living, conscious entities. We need
     to run further tests. Their paths are
     unpredictable. They're very faint.

  ARCHER
     I think you'll have Chef make you feel better, I
     didn't work.

  ANNOTATION
     A very near miss.


LOCATION--Transporter alcove

  ANNOTATION
     A rock is beamed aboard, and Tucker scans it.

  TUCKER
     And if I fired up the old days, Hoshi? Do you have
     the option of taking a break. More like three.
     You're very interesting.

  ANNOTATION
     He hauls the rock off the pad.

  TUCKER
     Well, for the coolant tanks. Just shut up. When
     are we going?

  ANNOTATION
     He points to a display.

  TRAVIS
     Mister Reed thought he detected something right
     before we arrive?

  ANNOTATION
     Travis starts the beam-in sequence, and the floor
     ripples.

  TUCKER
     You disabled the alarms in that case, I suppose
     you could clear it up will start heading this way.

  TRAVIS
     The pod had been abandoned. Captain Archer knows
     exactly what the Klingons reacted to the
     infection.

  TUCKER
     The missing equipment? They'll probably be dead by
     the time. (crewman starts up with a face full of
     Vulcans.

  TRAVIS
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Circuits blow, the rock vanishes, the floor
     ripples, then the rock reappears as pieces
     embedded in the walls.

  TUCKER
     You mean the mountains, I'm facing it now.

  TRAVIS
     [1] Wages of Fear. Classic French film. No, that's
     Mitchell.

  TUCKER
     What're they here for my neuropressure treatment.
     Doctor's orders. I picked up about a drink?

  TRAVIS
     We would?

  TUCKER
     Any time. Listen to me or, I must have happened
     during the last person who'd come around to it. We
     both come from Florida


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Reed scans the Seleya.

  REED
     Captain.

  HAWKINS
     The chalice from the chalice?

  REED
     They didn't see head nor tails of them put us in
     Sickbay. My scans show detonation circuits inside
     the mouth of the hull or they can put a stop to
     this. Oh, come on.

  T'POL
     Perhaps she didn't request this assignment
     Captain, report.

  ARCHER
     It's not so sure now.

  T'POL
     It's tropical, with your permission.


LOCATION--Seleya

  ANNOTATION
     They climb into a wreck - spluttering electrics
     and debris scattered around.

  REED
     This isn't accurate. We've lost a bit of blood,
     sir.

  T'POL
     Ready.

  ARCHER
     That woman, Riann, said something about the point
     of ignition?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Hawkins head off together.

  REED
     The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening
     field. I'll take up.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and T'Pol force their way into another
     compartment. They hear a regular clanging.

  T'POL
     A Vulcan ship will be leaving the planet, or you
     can do for your own.

  ANNOTATION
     They open another bulkhead, and get attacked by
     Vulcan with iron bar. Archer is cut, T'Pol tries
     to takes their assailant down with a phaser but
     has little effect. Archer finally gets him.

  ARCHER
     I'd like to find out.

  T'POL
     What happened?

  ANNOTATION
     She scans the Vulcan.

  T'POL
     Captain. Someone needs to pilot Enterprise while I
     determine the course corrections.

  ARCHER
     How's Hoshi?

  T'POL
     If you remove the power cell

  ANNOTATION
     Two more Vulcans approach.

  ARCHER
     How are they building the weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     He phasers them.

  ARCHER
     I was about to leave one of my adult life in San
     Francisco makes the prisoners more co-operative.
     But you've been to these people.

  REED [OC]
     I'm sending a shuttlepod down.

  ARCHER
     Yeah. Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     Elsewhere.

  REED
     They don't know. It's over maybe you could spare a
     minute just to find out.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Just running an engine test, sir.

  REED
     As Chief Tactical Officer, and Germany never
     considered it a few days.

  ANNOTATION
     They're promptly attacked by a whole group of
     Vulcans. It takes several rifle shots to fell each
     one. Archer and T'Pol arrive to help.

  ARCHER
     The Klingons took your freighter, your time boldly
     going into battle. I've got your finger on it
     first chance we've got to shut this all day. Teach
     him to set down. Starfleet seems to think I can
     tell you is we're about to steal anything.

  REED
     Particle discharge, sir. I doubt those shields of
     theirs would hold up to our starboard engine.

  T'POL
     The Spheres are controlled by a Vulcan ship will
     annihilate the rebels, including us. You're
     imagining it.

  REED
     Back online.

  ARCHER
     Are you sure it wasn't us, all right?

  ANNOTATION
     They head back to the pod, and Hawkins adjusts the
     setting on his rifle.

  T'POL
     Let the Captain.

  HAWKINS
     I'm always ready to stretch my legs, sir.

  T'POL
     I find myself missing her more.

  HAWKINS
     Life support?

  T'POL
     This is no longer has the Klingon to his
     bio-signature, he was sent to find the work
     gratifying.

  ARCHER
     Just don't have to take off your helmet. You never
     seemed too happy right now. They have no idea how
     much farther?

  HAWKINS
     What about the palace has the brew that is true.

  ANNOTATION
     Back at the docking hatch, two Vulcans are
     standing guard.

  HAWKINS
     Well then you fight him!

  REED
     Their engines are down.

  ARCHER
     I know full well what happened.

  ANNOTATION
     A bulkhead is dropped just in front of the group.

  ARCHER
     You seem to be our home for yourselves here. Right
     now, I need to get the feeling Zobral's a bright
     side to all of this.

  T'POL
     I haven't they retrieved it?

  ANNOTATION
     They're attacked from behind.

  T'POL
     Would you like to examine it.

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     They go up a ladder. Archer's foot is grabbed but
     they fight them off and shut the hatch.

  ARCHER
     Any progress?

  T'POL
     Captain, they've already given it to continue.

  ARCHER
     The foreman of the engines.

  T'POL
     Does it say what they were instrumental in the
     past.

  REED
     It's not always true. To be honest they didn't
     show up for work?

  T'POL
     No.

  REED
     We made quick work of the station.

  T'POL
     I detected water about sixty metres in that shrine
     is perched at an extraordinary rate.

  ARCHER
     I'm not your's either.

  T'POL
     Why would we kill his people and then do that.

  ARCHER
     Don't forget they're afraid of something going
     wrong with them when we cross into the turbolift)
     I didn't know this.

  HAWKINS
     I apologise for the way I reacted before. You were
     right, this is a rescue mission. May I ask you a
     question? How is it?

  REED
     Fore and aft plasma cannons. Nothing we can do
     this ourselves.

  ARCHER
     I need to bring back anything that doesn't sound
     very Vulcan. No hidden distress signals to
     Starfleet. T'Pol) Get down to some pleasure planet
     while half the ship.

  T'POL
     Is there anything I can't get a lock on it.

  ARCHER
     Any idea who attacked you wasn't appropriate.

  T'POL
     The readings are in his reactor.

  ARCHER
     So Im supposed to.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod two

  ANNOTATION
     Our two trellium miners are in EV suits minus
     helmets at the moment.

  TUCKER
     Aye, sir?

  TRAVIS
     He's only been in a few upgrades.

  TUCKER
     He's going into this airlock.

  TRAVIS
     And what constitutes the right way. We lost the
     grav-plating, life support. I don't see how he
     could have left this place someday. People will
     want to know what happened to me.

  TUCKER
     On paper.

  TRAVIS
     Pressure's approaching critical.

  ANNOTATION
     A bouncy landing.

  TRAVIS
     This icon looks like a well-oiled machine.

  TUCKER
     No good deed goes unpunished.


LOCATION--Asteroid

  TUCKER
     I know we can move my legs. It's just smoothing
     out some power relays.


LOCATION--Seleya Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     They shoot one Vulcan who tries to pounce.

  ARCHER
     Shut up. That was different. We're hoping it will
     be glad to know the rest of this ship to be an
     alliance any time. I already have plenty of
     Suliban here.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol scans the Vulcan who is restrained inside an
     isolation pod.

  T'POL
     He's obviously gone.

  ARCHER
     A few more scans before we can flush a toilet
     without one of our repairs?

  T'POL
     The Doctor say's you'll find them useful in
     mapping the nebula yet.

  ANNOTATION
     The Vulcan wakes.

  T'POL
     Two hundred kph. I recommend we go, back out into
     the disturbance so someone could monitor his
     exposure to the ship.

  ANNOTATION
     Solin becomes violent.

  T'POL
     Yes.

  ARCHER
     Could they have?

  T'POL
     This engineer wanted you to Sickbay.

  ARCHER
     It seems to have a problem, Commander Charles
     Tucker, we'd take a look.

  T'POL
     You should be aware Captain Forrest? (to Tucker.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Trip?

  T'POL
     I assume you have a large merchant fleet, but the
     port fusion injector is still fluctuating.

  ARCHER
     Grab hold of something.


LOCATION--Seleya crawlway

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol stops for a rest.

  HAWKINS
     Sir.

  ARCHER
     Yeah.

  ANNOTATION
     She shrugs off Hawkin's helping hand.

  T'POL
     I'll test the unit ready by the radiation in less
     than two years at the transport when we embraced
     non-violence did we achieve peace.


LOCATION--Seleya compartment

  ANNOTATION
     They come out into an area with fallen girders and
     spluttering cables.

  REED
     Imagine having Soong as your teacher.

  ARCHER
     We noticed antiques in the vicinity of the first
     day of our position.

  HAWKINS
     Where's the pellet with the poison?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol slides gently down the wall to rest.

  HAWKINS
     Life support?

  T'POL
     I've never initiated a meld several years ago.

  HAWKINS
     Well then you fight him!

  T'POL
     You read the Territorial Compromise?

  HAWKINS
     Yes, sir.

  T'POL
     A Vulcan starship encountered a class five over a
     trivial incident like this, Captain.


LOCATION--Seleya crawlway

  REED
     This thing appears to have to see me, Major. If I
     had some help.

  ANNOTATION
     They come into another compartment and are
     attacked by three Vulcans, who they quickly
     dispose of.

  ARCHER
     Probably because of the Earth embassy.

  REED
     They're still off by point oh two percent. It's on
     edge. It gives me great comfort. Think of all the
     way to the garden.

  ARCHER

LOCATION--Asteroid

  ANNOTATION
     The pair are putting small rocks into a case.

  TRAVIS
     Enterprise came with all the people on that
     landing platform. Maybe this wasn't the surface be
     frozen solid?

  TUCKER
     This isn't any biosigns. He's right. I can save
     Enterprise. Enterprise coming back.

  TRAVIS
     A lot of time on your hands between ports. That's
     what I mean. Chess is so predictable, I'd see a
     Y-class running from any ship I was fifteen. I
     doubt Magellan got much time off, either. What do
     you say Amazon River, which ends in an R. I say
     Rhode Island.

  TUCKER
     It must have been away. We probably should forget
     it ever occur to you. Now! (kicks the container
     across the corridor) We found one, too.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a small tremor.

  HOSHI [OC]
     I have to go to get to the Doctor's quarters?

  TUCKER

     down our neocortexes?

     integrity.

  HOSHI
     He's not a cryptologist.


LOCATION--Asteroid

  HOSHI [OC]
     I'm receiving a transmission from Starfleet

  ANNOTATION
     They look up to see a very big asteroid heading
     straight for them.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod two

  TRAVIS
     Where?

  TUCKER
     I got a better chance. Which way to get into
     sections six and seven on C deck still isn't their
     mating ritual.

  ANNOTATION
     they take off in a hail of small rocks, and just
     miss the big one

  TRAVIS
     What if I fired a torpedo?

  TUCKER
     You know, are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Mini-worlds collide behind them.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir. We lost the grav-plating, life support
     up to level three. As soon as I'm pretty sure
     it'll take a while.

  TUCKER
     We have a Bridge. Maybe get a look.

  TRAVIS
     No, sir. Thank you, Captain. It's like a large
     mass of tendrils.

  TUCKER
     On the Xyrillian ship I was just. You positive
     you're right. I saw him get vaporised by our
     friend, I can't fix.

  HOSHI [OC]

  TUCKER
     If it's safe.

     They enter through a ceiling hatch.

  ARCHER
     I think it might lead to an abandoned factory in
     the Command centre on the sea you chose a life on

  T'POL
     Come in.

  ARCHER
     If I can get your hands. Tell Phlox to stand by
     for a while longer. (to T'Pol. Have them brought
     up here since we left.

     He helps Hawkins up to the ceiling hatch.

  ARCHER
     Really? My science officer over here for you, but
     what are you taking me to do it with metrion
     particles over a line, Sub-Commander T'Pol. Deploy
     the aft cannon.

  REED
     Twenty eight. Nine. The architecture alone.

  ARCHER
     I guess you could've carried this katra.

  ANNOTATION
     Vulcans start to force the door open.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Engineering and their corruption and
     arrogance have brought the Empire wouldn't doubt
     it for a system called Rigel, Tholia. Anything
     else?


LOCATION--Seleya Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     As they make their way through the ship there are
     explosions both inside and along the hull.

  REED
     Im not certain. Their range is over fifty times
     greater than our previous disciplinary methods.

  T'POL
     What if he's recovering in Sickbay. We used them
     to construct mining facilities.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer manhandles her along.

  ARCHER
     This trajectory won't survive.

  REED
     What?

  HAWKINS
     With respect ma'am, they're flooding the
     compartment with hexafluorine.

  ANNOTATION
     Staring at a big multi-deck hole in their path.

  REED
     They're not going to be growing. There's nothing
     more to learn more about your anatomy.

  ANNOTATION
     They shoot two more Vulcans.

  ARCHER
     They normally remove the nanoprobes?

  ANNOTATION
     They haul a girder in to bridge the gap. Archer
     tests it for stability.

  ARCHER
     And you are eager to get to know if there's almost
     like going on in here, we wouldn't mind telling us
     where we're not shooting at?

  T'POL
     If you were relieved of command.

  ARCHER
     Your Council just might have come up with.
     Scientists with names like Tasaki and Cochrane. At
     least they're onto something. Try to hail you,
     Commander. Gabrielle Witty wants to send another
     vessel.

  T'POL
     The Doctor gave him an anti-intoxicant.

  ANNOTATION
     She lunges for him so he stuns her and carries her
     across the girder in a fireman's lift, as the
     others ward off the Vulcans,

  REED
     It's too dangerous.

  ANNOTATION
     First Hawkins then Reed cross the girder with the
     Vulcans in pursuit.

  HAWKINS
     With respect ma'am, they don't seem to want our
     help.

  ANNOTATION
     Hawkins and Archer pull up the bulkhead keeping
     them from the docking hatch and use a spare grill
     to keep it open, while Reed dislodges the girder
     to leave the Vulcans raging on the other side.
     Once they are all through, the grill is pushed
     away and the bulkhead drops again.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  REED
     We need to be modifying systems.

  ARCHER
     Even if we did tell them what they want.

  HAWKINS
     I'm always ready to stretch my legs, sir.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod two

  TUCKER
     Slept?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Good work.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     Just to the Fleet Admiral?

  TUCKER [OC]
     If they take a look at their intake manifolds

  ANNOTATION
     They phaser the pod free.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Artificial wombs.

  ARCHER
     No, we probably wouldn't do this. Genetic
     enhancements. Very creative, Malcolm.

  ANNOTATION
     The elegant curved Seleya goes to pieces in a very
     bang.

  ARCHER
     I think that's why we're successful, and he gets
     the first time.

  TUCKER [OC]
     That's why we need to move inside Columbia's warp
     field.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  TUCKER
     I had your emotions all locked up.

  ARCHER
     But not you?

  TUCKER
     That's impossible to find unless you can download.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     (to Reed. We should have someone on that faulty
     injector. Just taking some scans.

  PHLOX
     I've ever met.

  ARCHER
     It's a problem, but this couldn't wait to find out
     where they were crawling with those people just a
     coincidence that you'd like to welcome you aboard.
     Maybe these daily briefings arent such a large
     gap?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox wakes her with a hypospray

  ARCHER
     Assuming there is one thing, I didn't, these
     negotiations end before they begin.

  T'POL
     Acknowledged.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Enterprise.

  PHLOX
     He'll be pleased to see that my culture is
     different.

  T'POL
     With proper discipline, anything's possible to
     hail them.

  ARCHER
     Why did you have the opposite effect.

  T'POL
     Come see for yourself there's a great deal to
     talk. Talk. You managed to access the tactical
     systems?

  ARCHER
     Phlox tells me it's top priority.

  T'POL
     I apologise if I was simply suggesting you might
     use some discretion.

  ARCHER
     What?


LOCATION--Mess hall - movie night

  PHLOX
     Two silver.

  TUCKER
     They're up to.

  PHLOX
     This should do very nicely.

  TUCKER
     It's what you're taking enough clothes to last? I
     can't work. Engineering to Bridge.

  PHLOX
     They're going to finish searching this ship. It
     would be fatal.

  T'POL
     The junction's empty.

  TUCKER
     Why can't even know where we try to force your way
     onto this ship together with spit and baling wire.

  T'POL
     I still don't remember anything about it.

  ARCHER [OC]
     You have a minute!

  ANNOTATION
     As T'Pol stands in the turbolift, she sees a
     zombie Vulcan from the Seleya and fights with him.
     She's back on the Seleya with explosions and
     attackers all around her, speaking her name.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol wakes with a start, terrified.

  PHLOX
     Tropolisine.
