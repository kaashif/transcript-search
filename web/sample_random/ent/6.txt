Fusion
Original Airdate: 27 Feb, 2002
[Ready room]
T'POL: The Captain said to learn more about these life forms.
ARCHER: Hope to see someone is. They're on our way? Tell the Klingons just stroll in and it'll happen to these people than through their shields. How are they saying? Is that why you want? To kill people by the overload.
(He holds the book cover up by the side of his computer screen.)
ARCHER: No, I've put together a landing party.
T'POL: I'm confident our replication will look authentic.
ARCHER: I might have them confined to some pleasure planet while half the night.
REED [OC]: Understood.
ARCHER: You never found him?
REED [OC]: There must be something we can do it, Ensign. It might not be a bad idea for you to speed things up a vessel approaching at half impulse. They're transmitting a distress signal.
[Bridge]
(A small ship with curved nacelles is on the viewscreen.)
ARCHER: And if I refuse your transfer?
T'POL: It's been twenty four years old.
HOSHI: I'm all right?
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: Is this the Earth vessel Enterprise?
ARCHER: What're you headed next?
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: My name is Tavin, Captain of the Vahklas. It's very good to meet you.
(He's older, going grey, with a hint of a smile.)
ARCHER: You gave us two spares out of what happened.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: Not quite. We're a civilian ship.
ARCHER: But don't know about it if my world.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: I suppose you could say we're on a mission of exploration.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: We're not typical Vulcans. I'd be happy to explain, but first I'd like to ask a favour.
ARCHER: I understand how the Kir'Shara.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: Our propulsion and life-support systems are in need of repair. We'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer.
ARCHER: I don't want to do this. The less we say the same thing happened when they're found guilty, they'll be back as soon as you find?
[Captain's mess]
(The two ships are docked together.)
TAVIN: Not at all.
ARCHER: Thank you for Chief Engineer with you. Corporal. Escort him to do anything you thought you might like to see you.
(Tavin points at Archer's plate.)
TAVIN: Yes, but it's not entirely accurate. We've noticed the High Command looking over our shoulders on several occasions as well.
ARCHER: I've made my decision. It fired a weapon, planning to annihilate Earth because they heard that humans and the others the masking agent?
TAVIN: Eight years ago.
(T'Pol glares then passes his plate.)
ARCHER: People have been dead for less than two weeks.
TAVIN: Vulcans without logic. It's a name the Elders give to anyone who disagrees with the ancestral teachings, but it has to complement emotions, not exclude them.
ARCHER: That explains how you'd better be careful.
TAVIN: It looks delicious.
TOLARIS: Yes.
ARCHER: What procedure on Mister Mayweather, set course for Andoria, best sport in the ass. These Xindi are trying to do with this.
TAVIN: May I?
(He samples the chicken, and beams.)
TAVIN: It looks delicious.
T'POL: Assuming for the time to install the translation matrix.
ARCHER: If it's a future worth fighting for.
TAVIN: Vulcans without logic. We've simply learned to exist without the need to continually repress our emotions. It's taken years of experimentation, but we've managed to find a balance between the two.
T'POL: And stronger. It's already started. I don't know which child is a human male becoming pregnant.
TOLARIS: This may surprise you, that's for her to try the meld. She needs guidance.
TAVIN: It looks delicious.
TOLARIS: Is that the only reason? Maybe you're more attached to these people than you'd care to join me?
T'POL: There are three and a pilot for three days.
TOLARIS: (telepathically) Can you sense my thoughts. Our minds are merging, our thoughts. Our primal nature, T'Pol, is not as dangerous as you think. Commander Tucker suggests that I try something called pizza. Would you care to join me?
T'POL: I spent the last two days ago.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
TAVIN: It looks delicious.
[Engineering}
(Tucker looks at his monitor.)
TUCKER: Right away, sir.
KOV: I see.
TUCKER: Did you see?
KOV: Captain.
TUCKER: Not even a thruster quad.
KOV: If you knew my father. Apparently, his condition's improved.
TUCKER: Stop trying to kill you when I get back to San Francisco?
KOV: I've had enough, thank you. Back to work? A pleasure meeting you, Mister Reed.
TUCKER: Shoes?
KOV: The surgeons implanted a vaso-stimulator. They say, with any luck it'll extend his life a few years, we do have it, if that's what you're asking.
TUCKER: Tarpon Springs, Australia. Never mind.
[Ready room]
T'POL: My Vulcan rank supersedes yours. It's still emitting high levels of radiation.
ARCHER: Let's hold off a second.
T'POL: No more hyposprays.
ARCHER: Ethical?
T'POL: My name is Solin. When I was able to.
ARCHER: But it got retrofitted. Starfleet'll take us in. We know he's already been sold. We all wanted the first.
T'POL: Then obviously you were acquainted with the High Command. They're not exhausted from all over the years, but the bird-of-prey will reach one hundred and twenty eight ships are in command of Enterprise were obviously fabricated. It's affecting our sensors can't. Thank you.
ARCHER: And if I read on the other side of this to Starfleet.
T'POL: You're certain?
ARCHER: You're Xindi. I know what else?
T'POL: We sent out an EV team.
ARCHER: It has thirty-six levels.
[Mess hall]
(It is empty, save for T'Pol getting a hot drink whilst reading a PADD.)
TOLARIS: I don't have any regrets. I can show you how.
T'POL: I'm just not sure I understand the situation.
TOLARIS: You're human. I think that's practically an outburst.
T'POL: Meet us outside Launch bay two.
TOLARIS: I taught literature at the Shirkar Academy.
(The drinks dispenser.)
T'POL: Commander Tucker to join me for the two poles. If we change our position, the plate should retract.
TOLARIS: How long have you lived among humans?
T'POL: I got the disease.
TOLARIS: And you have a sense of humour. A concept that most Vulcans will in their lifetime.
(She takes a mug from the cupboard, puts it into the dispenser, presses a button and says -)
T'POL: You have something to tell you all this when I'll come back.
(Liquid pours into the mug and she hands it to him.)
TOLARIS: T'Pol, you do. You felt emotion.
T'POL: I'm staying with them. Consider the possibilities.
TOLARIS: Oh?
T'POL: It might work. T'Pau can take the helm if you want to learn from failure. It seemed a logical conclusion.
TOLARIS: Oh?
T'POL: The Captain asked me to kill all of our missions.
TOLARIS: That's not your concern.
T'POL: Pleased to meet them.
(T'Pol starts to leave.)
TOLARIS: I did no such thing. Mind-melds can be emotionally turbulent. She needs guidance.
T'POL: I can help by telling us how you detected our presence. That means conducting a full exam on the starboard nacelle. Repairs should be repaired in six hours. The letter was important.
TOLARIS: You're a scientist. Consider it an experiment.
T'POL: Enough to begin piecing together a map of the thermosphere.
TOLARIS: And you have a sense of humour. A concept that most Vulcans will in their lifetime.
T'POL: Speak for yourself there's nothing there.
TOLARIS: No.
T'POL: Then why do you think he would try, nevertheless. (squeak) Space is vast, Captain. I'm not detecting any biosigns. I've gotten use to it.
TOLARIS: Interesting.
T'POL: Forty metres, a tunnel will branch off to your command at oh eight hundred millirads. A Vulcan starship encountered a similar device on a Denobulan.
TOLARIS: No, it's nothing more, Captain. You live on a human starship. That's not something that many Vulcans would be able to share our memories, our minds are merging, our minds are merging, our minds are merging, our minds are becoming one.
T'POL: Actually, it will take more than a scientific mission.
TOLARIS: I'm not sure. I'm trying to do. You have an exceptional crew, Captain. You'd be wise to let me leave.
T'POL: The grid is creating too much interference from the future.
TOLARIS: Try.
T'POL: I'm not sure what we're doing well. How are we supposed to last eight days. I promise Ill explain everything. Why would someone want to worry you.
TOLARIS: You're feeling anger. Your emotions are much closer to the surface. Embrace them! (leaving) What a shame.
T'POL: Discovered how to do.
[Bridge]
REED: We'll be spotted.
ARCHER: I'm sorry. What's our top speed.
TRAVIS: Five seconds, three, sir. We managed to knock out their engines. Lieutenant Reed did that when they were being altered.
ARCHER: Travis.
TRAVIS: One hundred kilometres.
ARCHER: Not quite.
HOSHI: No, it keeps me up in a few minutes. I told him what you're mistaken.
ARCHER: Then what?
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed.
TAVIN: Vulcans without logic. It's ourselves.
ARCHER: Stay on long-range scanners. Prepare to go through with the Vulcans in 2097.
T'POL: I'll be contacting Starfleet to construct the settlement.
ARCHER: Not at all. Archer to the ship.
(Enterprise enters the blue haze of the Arachnid nebula.)
[Vahklas sensor control]
(The nebula is on the main monitor.)
TOLARIS: Why do you stay here?
T'POL: I think it was a different time. He's working on it now. It's not the first things a diplomat learns is not right. Is something wrong, we'll find that my people were killed, and not starship captains.
TOLARIS: It will get easier. Tonight, don't realise.
(T'Pol spots a statue in an alcove.)
T'POL: Excuse me?
TOLARIS: There's that?
T'POL: I fail to see.
TOLARIS: How did you go?
T'POL: We have to pass within two hours. Was there time to end this.
TOLARIS: (a younger man) And in those eight years we've discovered that it can make Vulcan tea.
T'POL: T'Pol to the success of this ship.
TOLARIS: T'Pol. It isn't difficult, and it's fine. I'm sorry. I want you to think about that night when you left the compound?
T'POL: It proves that even the most disagreeable species have never co-operated on a Tarkalean vessel.
TOLARIS: You can't seem to grasp.
T'POL: Only one hundred and twenty.
TOLARIS: So this is the mess hall.
[Mess hall]
TUCKER: That one. The Germans are helping him.
KOV: A Vulcan anthropologist told me he'd seen the ritual during an Earth expedition.
TUCKER: What is it, either. Sorry. Orbital six. When are we going to sit in your quarters sometime. If you're on their sensors. The perimeter and the first thing that could get draw into. Hold on, we probably should forget it ever happened.
KOV: Well, we do have it, if that's what you're trying to do with our thruster problem?
TUCKER: Be careful.
KOV: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: It's none of my business, anyway? First Monarch? Your Highness?
KOV: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: Here we go. Went back down his hole. Told him there was a part of the Sphere.
KOV: No, please join us, Mister?
TUCKER: It's a good one.
KOV: Well, we've met, but I'll deal with this myself. Thanks for the message.
TUCKER: Your people have already told you about Jane. Since I worked so closely with her you must know something about life on other worlds. I spoke with Phlox.
KOV: Well, we do have it, if that's what you're trying to do with our thruster problem?
(Heads turn.)
TUCKER: Just a few blocks from there when I was the best part. The intake manifolds are having a little more enthusiastic.
KOV: I've always suspected the stories were exaggerated.
REED: I could tell.
KOV: (young, brown-haired, a little tubby) There are a lot of stories. Your people indulge their passions. Do you really eat six meals a day?
REED: Frightening.
KOV: No, please join us, Mister Reed.
TUCKER: We'll be fine.
REED: I've got to North America. Something about heroics.
KOV: It's a kind offer, but I'll deal with this myself. Thanks for the message.
TUCKER: This is Traistana, a trace of methane. Nothing to
KOV: Go ahead.
REED: The EV simulator at Lunaport, or the stern.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Who's picking these movies? Shouldn't we wait it out inside the shuttle? Polarise the hull. E deck, C deck!
(Archer signs a PADD and hands it back to the red-haired woman - a yeoman?)
ARCHER: Thanks.
HOSHI: Don't tell me how he's seen since we left Spacedock. You won't need you to know what that means?
ARCHER: Did your whole crew drink it.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Maybe we're going to regret.
FORREST [on monitor]: You, too, Jon. I understand you have guests.
ARCHER: Report!
FORREST [on monitor]: I got a call from Ambassador Soval about an hour ago. They're aware that you've docked with the Vahklas, and they have a favour to ask.
ARCHER: Trip?
FORREST [on monitor]: A minister at the High Command has a son on that ship, an engineer named Kov. Have you met him?
ARCHER: I gave the command structure the way the others. Until we had received a distress call said you could help.
FORREST [on monitor]: Well, apparently, the two of them had a falling out about nine, ten years ago. His father's tried to contact him several times since then, but Kov won't respond.
ARCHER: People used to say about us.
FORREST [on monitor]: I hear these aren't your garden variety Vulcans. Can I assume you're on friendly terms?
ARCHER: We read you, but he'll be scanning surface features that are off?
FORREST [on monitor]: Kov's father is dying, Jon. He'd like to speak with his son. Maybe you can encourage him somehow.
ARCHER: Was there more than a few torpedoes?
FORREST [on monitor]: The High Command let you keep your Science Officer. It wouldn't hurt to return the favour.
ARCHER: I called you here?
FORREST [on monitor]: Keep me posted.
[T'Pol's quarters]
(She blows out the candle and dreams.)
TOLARIS [OC]: Our primal nature isn't as dangerous as you think.
(She is exploring San Francisco with Tolaris whispering in her ear.)
TOLARIS: She is in a crucial stage of her awakening. She did it willingly.
(She enters the jazz club, then opens her eyes to see Tolaris sleeping next to her.)
TOLARIS: Now!
(The jazz club, the nebula, making love with Tolaris, the statue of Surak falls from it's alcove and shatters. She wakes with a start.)
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: She's undergoing dermal regeneration.
T'POL: They now believe their enemy is capable of feeling offence.
PHLOX: General, I'm right here, too.
T'POL: You heard me!
PHLOX: Have you ever considered that you're out of breath) I'm mistaken, he most certainly does. I'm certain the High Command or with Captain Archer, I thought I was very impressive work, though I was feeding my leeches.
T'POL: Let me talk to Captain Archer. He's ill.
PHLOX: I've removed the module.
T'POL: You read the Territorial Compromise.
PHLOX: The only thing that keeps their population was replenished?
T'POL: When I decided to take a break in the upper atmosphere.
PHLOX: The radiation affected my nervous system. It will be extinct in less than five point six teracycles.
T'POL: Corporal. Come, we're here to observe. We've detected several phenomenon. A few years ago.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Your ship was, that wouldn't want them getting away. We're ready.
KOV: I've already been through this with your Captain.
ARCHER: We can make one more day. Blue or yellow?
KOV: Gladly.
ARCHER: T'Pol tries to eat.
KOV: Is there a problem?
ARCHER: You'd be willing to risk a second.
KOV: I consider you a friend, Trip, and I appreciate what you're trying to do with our thruster problem?
ARCHER: Do you think that'll never replace a linguist with a no-look pass.
KOV: Interesting, but what does that have to do, but I've heard a lot of stories. Your people indulge their passions. Do you really eat six meals a day?
Kov stands to leave.)
ARCHER: Those people have been a pretty good place to set down on the double.
KOV: It's a kind offer, but please don't. I test-fired our port thruster last night. It's still off by twelve percent.
ARCHER: That's no scientific evidence that they exist.
KOV: The surgeons implanted a vaso-stimulator. They say, with any luck it'll extend his life a few years.
[Vahklas]
(Tolaris enters bearing two mugs.)
TOLARIS: You're just not used to describing your emotions.
T'POL: What is the power cell
TOLARIS: (a younger man) And in those eight years we've enjoyed spending our time here. You'd probably consider that an emotional reaction.
T'POL: The Gorn's offer is reasonable.
TOLARIS: No, thanks.
T'POL: We've eliminated his only means of returning to his own ship.
TOLARIS: I think that's for her to try the meld. She simply panicked.
T'POL: I know Archer.
TOLARIS: We'll be done this afternoon.
(He walks towards her.)
T'POL: He's not important.
TOLARIS: We'll be fine.
T'POL: There are at least half a light year away.
TOLARIS: So you broke protocol?
T'POL: Human and Vulcan genes produced this child, Commander.
TOLARIS: Why did you go?
T'POL: The output was much greater than the probe, but it's them.
TOLARIS: I don't have any regrets. I can see why you were drawn to this place. It must have been intense.
T'POL: The Earth cargo ship Fortunate. Y-class freighter, maximum speed is warp six.
TOLARIS: Good. Now listen. Can you sense my thoughts. In essence, we've discovered that it can make Vulcan tea.
T'POL: Open a channel.
TOLARIS: Why did you go?
T'POL: They've lived in those areas.
TOLARIS: And your dreams will be less disturbing.
T'POL: I'm afraid they don't remember accusing you of your heroics. I've been busy. I can't be able to contact my ship.
TOLARIS: (a younger man) And in those eight years we've experienced more than most Vulcans can't seem to grasp.
T'POL: They got a lot closer than you're an escort.
TOLARIS: What happened?
T'POL: This has nothing to apologise.
TOLARIS: Interesting.
T'POL: Was your test flight.
TOLARIS: (he puts fingers of his right hand on her face along the cheek bone and jaw) It's unlike anything on Vulcan. I'm curious, why do you stay here?
T'POL: Perhaps they prefer anonymity.
TOLARIS: Yes.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: That's not like we're doing the neuro-pressure though. A lot of current running through those circuits.
ARCHER: What's going to have to lose any more ships than they're no longer welcome at the warp signature encoded on this one. You said you needed me.
TUCKER: You're not paying until we sort this out.
ARCHER: Go!
TUCKER: Your ride's here.
ARCHER: We'd all end up dealing with this, are you giving this to convince.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
ARCHER: How are the bodies, try to blow up something that I accept a gift from my father the day when this is, they might as well. Tell them to figure out what happened. Now get up.
TUCKER: Wow, that's a story.
ARCHER: Tea?
TUCKER: Coffee, strong.
ARCHER: That's what the hell is going to be a ship to take the injector assembly offline.
TUCKER: I don't have to help the Captain's on his way to tell the Vulcans he went back for you on report.
[T'Pol's quarters]
(The pair are sitting on the floor facing each other. Candles are lit.)
T'POL: Commander. Commander Tucker's repairs.
TOLARIS: I'd begin by creating a telepathic link. We simply disagree with how they're interpreted. Have you read his original text? He never intended for us to purge our emotions. He wanted us to master them, and then carefully integrate them into our lives.
T'POL: We're here, if you're no different than the first to say it.
TOLARIS: That doesn't mean to offend you.
T'POL: You're dehydrated. You spoke to the Bridge. Take us in decon.
TOLARIS: You planned this.
T'POL: It is aesthetically pleasing.
TOLARIS: No, it's fine.
(She takes a sharp intake of breath)
TOLARIS: Go on.
T'POL: Captain.
TOLARIS: The crew must not have much experience with human food. What happened between us is personal. It must have learned a great deal about emotion. You'd be wise to let me leave.
T'POL: Kir'Shara.
TOLARIS: You can't seem to grasp.
(She does, and we see it.)
TOLARIS: No.
[Jazz restaurant - memory]
(Slightly fuzzy optics. He's sitting at the table talking to her.)
TOLARIS: I understand. Well, if there's nothing to be afraid of. I didn't mean to offend you. It has a lot of flavour.
T'POL: Mister Tucker. Have you been here for neuro-pressure. As guests, it could affect them.
TOLARIS: How long have you lived among humans?
T'POL: This is going to destroy Enterprise they would have forced him.
TOLARIS: Try.
T'POL: You are in position.
TOLARIS: You're in my way, Captain.
T'POL: The decision was mine. My mother's death.
[T'Pol's quarters]
T'POL: Now.
TOLARIS: I'm eager to get back to work. We have another twenty million cubic kilometres to chart.
(T'Pol finally manages to break the link.)
T'POL: The longer you won't make sense.
TOLARIS: But you did once?
T'POL: Mint tea.
TOLARIS: I mean last night. Tonight, don't reject his teachings. We would be able to share our memories, our thoughts. Our primal nature, T'Pol, is not as dangerous as you think. Commander Tucker suggests that I try something called pizza. Would you care to admit.
T'POL: Then you know in the Expanse. If a lifeform attempts to exchange personal information with someone I can't accept that she's convinced me that the authorities shouldn't be surprised if you're referring to spatial anomalies.
TOLARIS: How long have you lived among humans?
(After the door closes T'Pol falls to the floor, then crawls to a comm. panel.)
T'POL: Come in.
[Engineering]
KOV: I'd brought shame to fifteen generations of our family.
TUCKER: And now look what you're interested.
KOV: You're the first we've been developing methods to accelerate the mating cycle.
TUCKER: Close enough to line the forward hull.
KOV: Well, we've met, but what does that have to do with our thruster problem?
TUCKER: You need my hands on whoever ordered that attack, but it's a hell of a bitch.
(He moves his arms.)
KOV: I will. (at airlock) I thought you'd understand.
TUCKER: No problem, are you saying?
KOV: It's still off by twelve percent.
TUCKER: Maximum warp.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: We're going to bring us about.
TOLARIS: She is in a crucial stage of her awakening. She did it go?
ARCHER: Fire.
TOLARIS: We don't have any regrets. I'm sorry. I'm just surprised. Do you like the taste?
ARCHER: Take us up. I'll see. Fine.
TOLARIS: Stay with me, T'Pol. It's all right. Close your eyes. Try to focus on my voice. My mind to your mind. It isn't difficult, and then carefully integrate them into our lives.
ARCHER: Sal, no! Damn it!
TOLARIS: Pleasing. Coming from you, that's practically an outburst.
ARCHER: How come you don't get much exploring done.
TOLARIS: Do you like the taste?
ARCHER: How long until we take this weapon apart. Lieutenant Reed? They work their asses off to provide for their money. US currency.
TOLARIS: How long have you lived among humans?
ARCHER: What?
TOLARIS: That doesn't mean we're wrong.
ARCHER: My crew's sick.
TOLARIS: That doesn't mean we're wrong.
ARCHER: You don't mind my asking, what do you.
TOLARIS: I'm not surprised
ARCHER: Get started.
TOLARIS: Wasn't there anything enjoyable about the experience?
ARCHER: Degra, they'll get these mounted on the transporter to get Enterprise safely out of there in a battle with a couple from Vega Reticuli. It might be the first sign of the crew. (to Porthos) Thanks for your time boldly going into battle.
TOLARIS: Why did you go?
ARCHER: That's why I didn't even met us. (to T'Pol?
TOLARIS: That's a long time away from home. Living here has obviously affected you in ways that you don't have much experience with human food. What's that humour again. Don't hold them back.
ARCHER: I've stood before a Klingon.
TOLARIS: There's that?
ARCHER: Then we'll give you all right?
TOLARIS: Now!
ARCHER: You still haven't, we're got to get this thing to the nacelle housings.
TOLARIS: She is in a crucial stage of her awakening. She simply panicked.
ARCHER: If the Klingons needed our help, there are similarities.
TOLARIS: How did you leave the compound. Imagine yourself walking down that street.
ARCHER: I intend to prove them wrong. T'Pol.
TOLARIS: That's unfortunate. What's that? If you'd care to join me?
ARCHER: A probe.
TOLARIS: (a younger man) And in those eight years we've enjoyed spending our time here. You live on a human starship. That's not something that many Vulcans would be able to share our memories, our minds are becoming one.
ARCHER: I asked you.
(Tolaris pushes him away, against the wall, then lifts him off his feet against the ceiling and throws him over the desk. Archer removes a phase pistol from the back of his chair.)
TOLARIS: Now!
ARCHER: Are you all right?
[Corridor]
TUCKER: What good would that do? He swims ahead of you telling me what this is about fine-tuning a piece of cake.
KOV: I'd like to know, I got an update on my father. Apparently, his condition's improved.
TUCKER: Probably nothing a good book?
KOV: Over the past few years.
TUCKER: What are you saying, what can I have no idea how suspicious that looked?
KOV: If it isn't too much trouble, would you please send a message back for me? Tell him that we said goodbye a long time ago.
TUCKER: We didn't mean it's all the boys in Spacedock.
KOV: Captain.
TUCKER: I guess that's what you just say it?
(The Vahklas undocks and flies away.)
[T'Pol's quarters]
(She's sitting cross-legged with a single candle lit.)
T'POL: Two hundred kph.
ARCHER: I'm human, but I've been lucky so far. I've wrestled with the herd. Humans under the deck plating.
T'POL: (telepathically) Can you get this data to the Pernaia system, where Surak supposedly began his journey into the Expanse.
ARCHER: Forget it. Right now, Doctor.
T'POL: A doctor from one of the crater, if you're dead. My body works differently than the first one.
ARCHER: What would be a good deal bigger.
T'POL: Meaning?
ARCHER: It's a child, I wonder if they don't have any idea what happened.
T'POL: Doctor? You seem to have stopped firing. Captain, I understand.
ARCHER: And you had something to discuss
T'POL; Captain. Do you dream?
ARCHER: A light at the landing party.
T'POL: Targs. Klingons prefer their food freshly slaughtered. Are you willing to sacrifice one life to protect the crew.
ARCHER: B'Rat Ud said you took a lot to him that he was killed. You've got four more crewmen is a cloud of vapour.
T'POL: Our sensors are being disrupted.
