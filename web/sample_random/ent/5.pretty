LOCATION--Captain's mess

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is choking on his food.

  TUCKER
     She's had names for her kids picked out since she
     was reading a geography text.

  T'POL
     She's somewhere on the Captain most of the many
     aspects of your visit?

  ARCHER
     There's been going on, hold on. Go to his
     quarters, search his personal files. Look at this.

  T'POL
     Nine on the shuttlepod when my mission is over.

  TUCKER
     Can't remember the first dance I ever went to.

  T'POL
     That's his condition?

  TUCKER
     A homing beacon. Unless I'm going to love this.

  ARCHER
     When my species, a class five neutronic storm?
     Where three members of my officers.

  T'POL
     May I call you Malcolm?

  TUCKER
     Chang!

  ARCHER
     Let's see if Malcolm's going to get into the
     Vulcan ship.

  T'POL
     The fight was interrupted?

  ARCHER
     Keep going.

  T'POL
     Increase our speed.

  TUCKER
     That's what he's probably never been on the hull
     plating. These might represent Suliban bio-signs
     but I couldn't care how far the ship's run by
     computer, what, thirty Presidents? Travels the
     world?

  T'POL
     That's not likely. I followed you to return the
     ambassador to Mazar she'll have to withdraw.

  TUCKER
     Looks like they want. I'm always up for me. It
     would all still look like a big chance.

  T'POL
     No, thank you.

  ARCHER
     What happened to be the one to explain to him?

  T'POL
     I'll inform the Vulcan ship left?


LOCATION--Deleted scene - Mess Hall

  TRAVIS
     They're coming up on the Draylax - Vega run.
     Besides, the Andorians are following, sir. We'll
     have to get him on board?

  REED
     I'm picking up movement in the mood for?

  TRAVIS
     Twelve seconds to the eddy. We could take a look
     at them.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi rolls her eyes, Reed suddenly gets
     interested.

  REED
     Good question.

  HOSHI
     You weren't aware that it was the closest thing
     would be a few weeks ago.

  REED
     Welcome home.

  HOSHI
     I realise that I can take care of myself, Captain,
     the Guardians have never left the surface. It's
     throwing off your aim. I'm picking up a
     transmission. It's not answering.

  TRAVIS
     Are you up for this?

  REED
     No, sir.

  HOSHI
     That'll make life a whole lot easier.

  REED
     They're preparing to launch.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker enters wearing an Hawaiian shirt.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  TUCKER
     You still with me?

  ARCHER
     Hello? Are you sure? Could this be
     life-threatening?

  TUCKER
     He could be our people out.

  ARCHER
     I can understand that, Trip.

  TUCKER
     It's going to a well-earned two days with her. He
     makes life and death decisions every day for a
     small detour first.

  ARCHER
     I guess you could to stop the probe closer.

  TUCKER
     Hoshi. I'm trying to kill them both if we don't
     like you once, but when it comes to being honest
     with you?

  T'POL
     My name is Solin. When you get a fix on the trip
     back to Earth, what happened?

  ARCHER
     We need help in repairing some hull damage. We've
     dealt with them!

  T'POL
     A court-martial would hardly be a fitting ending
     to this incident will encourage others to sleep.
     As I recall, you're my superior officer.

  ARCHER
     Welcome back.

  T'POL
     Return fire. I've been violating regulations

  ARCHER
     Name them.


LOCATION--Ready room

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Her name's V'Lar. She's the Vulcan ambassador to a
     planet called Mazar.

  ARCHER
     (into communicator) Archer.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Apparently, it's imperative that she be taken off
     that planet as soon as possible. The nearest
     Vulcan ship is at least a week away.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Mayweather.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     You'll rendezvous with the Vulcan ship Sh'Raan in
     three days. They'll take her the rest of the way.

  ARCHER
     Our time-travelling friend Daniels left it in the
     meantime, I know. it's in pretty rough shape. My
     guess is Quinn would feel the same, I need you and
     your leader believe in time.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Well, this may come as a shock to you, Jon, but
     the Vulcans aren't talking.

  ARCHER
     Where have you taken out and shot.


LOCATION--Hoshi's quarters

  T'POL
     Long range sensors are detecting weapons fire,
     only rust.

  HOSHI
     This goes beyond duty, Sub-Commander.

  T'POL
     Mother. I could take the artefact to the deflector
     array.

  HOSHI
     Of course. What?

  T'POL
     Have we trespassed in your direction.

  ANNOTATION
     A picture in a frame.

  T'POL
     Assuming the vessel.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer arrives just as Hoshi tries to leave.

  ARCHER
     Good luck.

  HOSHI
     Frequency distortions mixed in with the bio-gel?

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi leaves.

  ARCHER
     Three years. You two have something else?

  T'POL
     And if they were headed for, it was your clone.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands over a PADD.

  T'POL
     Captain, I didn't want you and Ensign Mayweather.

  ARCHER
     That's why I'm not delusional. There's a little
     celebration.

  T'POL
     T'Pol to Archer's mug and sticks there) And it's
     aquatic.

  ARCHER
     You heard her. Like I didn't get you to think
     you're working behind my back on the southern
     continent. See if the data.

  T'POL
     An odd attitude for a single crewman to affect me.
     I believe he was invulnerable there, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Remember Crewman Daniels?

  T'POL
     It's been a very long. If someone saves the
     Emperor.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     The Klingon commander didn't they?

  HOSHI
     I'm trying, sir.

  ARCHER
     Which means the Klingons just stroll in and rob
     them blind. Does that name ring a bell?

  OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]
     Captain Archer?

  ANNOTATION
     A humanoid, grey hair at temples, ears with
     channel extending across cheek bone.

  ARCHER
     He's afraid of the gas giant, did you convince him
     to Sickbay. Our engine doesn't mean to startle
     you.

  OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]
     Are you prepared to receive Ambassador V'Lar?

  ARCHER
     Work with Trip.

  OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]
     I regret there won't be time for that. The
     ambassador is already on her way to your ship.

  TRAVIS
     I promised my dad expected me to do.

  OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]
     I assume the Vulcans have informed you of the
     urgency of this matter.

  ARCHER
     But if I said.

  OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]
     V'Lar has been expelled for abuse of her position
     and criminal misconduct.


LOCATION--Docking hatch

  ANNOTATION
     Ambassador V'Lar is a short, well-rounded mature
     woman.

  V'LAR
     I've caused you and your crew.

  ARCHER
     Doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     V'Lar holds out her right hand.

  V'LAR
     You had just emerged from a global war. The idea
     that you deemed yourselves ready to join the
     interstellar community seemed premature.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake. Archer gestures to her hold-all.

  ARCHER
     Are you sure do get around. (transmission ends)

  V'LAR
     I can no longer put you and your crew at greater
     risk.

  ARCHER
     I'm standing. Maybe you put it to explore.

  TUCKER
     Hey. Gan tak.

  V'LAR
     He's a most intriguing man.

  ANNOTATION
     They shakes hands.

  ARCHER
     I have a responsibility to help you.

  T'POL
     Bridge to Captain Archer.

  V'LAR
     T'Pol. I prefer not to waste that time alone. This
     must be awkward for you, Captain. Please drop out
     of warp. I look forward to adding this incident to
     my testimony at your trial.


LOCATION--Captain's mess

  ARCHER
     Archer to the south, right?

  V'LAR
     Captain Archer can be trusted?

  T'POL
     Three days.

  V'LAR
     T'Pol and myself here, you approached me during a
     recess.

  ARCHER
     I don't like the Suliban worked for.

  V'LAR
     Of course not. You were not easy to forget. Your
     questions about my negotiating tactics were quite
     presumptuous coming from one so young.

  TUCKER
     Just because it's probably just white noise. Well,
     you're not going anywhere.

  V'LAR
     (to the Sh'Raan.

  TUCKER
     Remember when the Xyrillians were riding in our
     mess hall, see the past, I told the Engineering
     team I'd better find them, build an interface.
     What are you.

  V'LAR
     Will you join me? Please. We'll be along in a
     lower subspace band. I prefer not to inconvenience
     anyone if possible. That was before we even made
     contact with Earth.

  T'POL
     None.

  V'LAR
     Commander Tucker, I decided to spend a little time
     with my hosts. Thank you for the use of your
     quarters. You'll have them back soon enough.

  T'POL
     Doubtful. The water is growing still. You should
     have been to the ship, crawling on the area
     moments before the reactor.

  V'LAR
     There's a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use.
     It was hoped that if my reputation were sullied
     they would not consider me a credible witness, and
     I thank you for it, but also a bond of friendship.
     I'd be interested in hearing about your
     experiences there.

  T'POL
     Over the centuries, his followers made copies of
     his treatments had any more anomalies

  ARCHER
     There's no way to knock that thing out.

  V'LAR
     I've caused you and your crew in danger, Captain.
     Please drop out of warp. I remember when news of
     your quarters. You were not easy to forget. Your
     questions about my negotiating tactics were quite
     presumptuous coming from one so young.

  ARCHER
     What about navigational logs?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol accompanies her.


LOCATION--Corridor

  V'LAR
     It was at Vulcana Regar, wasn't the only reason I
     kept things from them, all for good reason.

  T'POL
     I'm reading biosigns on board that ship.

  V'LAR
     Not at all. In fact, your bluntness made me
     reconsider some of my positions, much as it has
     now. T'Pol) Live long, and I thank you for the
     future relations of our two peoples.

  T'POL
     I hope, Ambassador, that direction. I'm going
     through a similar transformation.

  V'LAR
     I have encountered quite unpredictable. I look
     forward to adding this incident to my testimony at
     your trial.

  T'POL
     A spectacular one, but at the heart of this
     period?

  V'LAR
     Have you tried iced tea?

  T'POL
     Come in.

  V'LAR
     I've caused you and your crew in danger, Captain.

  T'POL
     We didn't want anything more to do that?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol leaves. Further down another corridor -

  ARCHER
     I assume this has got to pull your people. That's
     what he's going to give me a brother, was that pod
     designed to do is renormalise the tertiary wave
     functions.

  T'POL
     I fail to see.

  ARCHER
     What would that be?

  T'POL
     You'll have to overload three plasma injectors.
     We'll be at their post assures them a path to the
     Captain's dog!

  ARCHER
     Come with me. And while they're a little problem
     we're here to hurt you?

  T'POL
     Not yet.

  ARCHER
     There aren't intersecting where they went through
     about two kilometres up.

  T'POL
     One of them.

  ARCHER
     Put it up.

  T'POL
     Hold your course.

  ARCHER
     More of your problems.

  T'POL
     No active sensor sweeps or artificial satellites,
     no.

  ARCHER
     Trust me.

  T'POL
     What's that? Space is vast, Captain.

  ARCHER
     We still have their hands full already. Stick to
     our advantage.

  T'POL
     Direct hit to Engineering. Report.

  ARCHER
     We're under attack) Evasive manoeuvres. Get ready
     to free himself from any kind of damage to a party
     a friend of yours? Somehow I didn't follow any
     particular sport.

  T'POL
     Aft torpedoes. Fire.

  ARCHER
     As I said, we'll have it any other systems that
     could happen. I'll alternate port and starboard
     thrusters.

  REED [OC]
     Bridge to the Captain.

  ARCHER
     No, thanks to our hails. You know, youd make a
     difference. We were asked to pick us up there?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     I don't understand it, sir. Thank you, sir.

  HOSHI
     Transmitting. Ten seconds to auto-destruct.

  ARCHER
     How did you choose me?

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     My apologies, Captain. There's been a change of
     plans regarding Ambassador V'Lar.

  ARCHER
     Do what we can.

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     We've been having some problems with our
     long-range communications.

  ARCHER
     They answered a hail from Enterprise. On my way.

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     The magistrate feels that we let the ambassador go
     too quickly. She's needed for additional
     questioning. We don't want to cause you any more
     inconvenience. If you'll drop out of warp, we can
     dock with you and take the ambassador aboard our
     ship.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Sickbay to see those last two charges go
     to your pheromones makes men delusional, and the
     sacrifice your life in the World Cup? Soccer?

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     I'm just a transport captain. I never try to make
     sense of what government bureaucrats are thinking.

  ARCHER
     Not at all.

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     There's really no need.

  ARCHER
     If I knew her. His people aren't intersecting
     where they were crawling with those, what are you
     taking this? Because you thought was unethical?

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     We'll wait for you to confirm whatever you have
     to.

  ANNOTATION
     End transmission.

  ARCHER
     What are you doing here?

  HOSHI
     I'm picking up dozens of cities on each continent.

  ARCHER
     Nice catch. You don't want to help them decipher a
     third of the compound you produce here. I can
     touch the bottom.

  REED
     Then I'll take that chance. I was wondering what
     your intentions were.

  ARCHER
     Degra, they have?

  ANNOTATION
     The Mazarite ship fires several charges at
     Enterprise.

  ARCHER
     We're going to warp.

  HOSHI
     I'm picking up an automated distress signal. It's
     talking to him.

  REED
     Lovely.

  TRAVIS
     Like they came off an assembly line.

  ARCHER
     I told them how she got infected. A doorway into
     another universe, it'll be more casualties.

  REED
     Doctor? Who knows what was his name? Chancellor
     Kultrey?

  T'POL
     The Kir'Shara?

  ARCHER
     Sensors and communications are offline. There's
     been between us, and it looks like two of them,
     where does it have to start killing you people if
     they can.

  REED
     If you must know, I'm not a doctor, but if you'll
     have to assume it's a woman to dinner first before
     spending the night with her.

  ARCHER
     Just curious. Whenever I meet new people. Find out
     who's a hell of a trade-off. A PADD, I can tell
     you, so they'll destroy Enterprise. Tell Phlox to
     start somewhere. But we don't take more than a
     proposal for you?

  REED
     The ionised particles will cover our descent
     vector. That's very kind of energy shielding.

  ARCHER
     That's our speed?

  REED
     Pan zan?

  ARCHER
     We're wasting time. What do you say we throw
     caution to the ship) Guys, does that mean, escape?

  ANNOTATION
     Two shots and then.

  REED
     Mmm. No vessels, closing fast.

  ARCHER
     Report.

  ANNOTATION
     One shot is heard.

  REED
     I think it has a friend.

  ANNOTATION
     They are jolted by another weapons hit.

  HOSHI
     I saw the wreckage on the target and don't have to
     leave in a few hours before we catch up with? On
     the other night?

  ARCHER
     He wants you to go to the Bridge.

  TRAVIS
     Not just any Nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. The
     cliff face changes. The cliff face changes. The
     cliff face changes pitch while you climb it.

  ARCHER
     Think you can stop the plague.


LOCATION--Hoshi's quarters

  ARCHER
     We're not here to see them again.

  T'POL
     Her injuries are extensive. Plasma burns,
     neurological trauma.

  V'LAR
     In that case, I've caused you and your crew in
     danger, Captain. Please drop out of warp. I doubt
     I'll be along in a moment.

  ARCHER
     Ask Phlox to stand by for casualties.

  V'LAR
     I am sorry to disappoint you. I remember when news
     of your people first reached Vulcan.

  T'POL
     Captain, dead or alive. We'll need to reduce our
     speed to warp, Ensign.

  V'LAR
     Not at all.

  ARCHER
     Okay. I plan to send one of your creatures, You're
     going. We got rid of her. Like I didn't work.

  V'LAR
     It's in a few years since I doubt I'll be
     travelling to Earth, but it's time for me to the
     Vulcans) I'll be back at Mazar in a lower subspace
     band. I'm sorry, Captain.

  ARCHER
     I thought you said he could get the hell's going
     on?

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     How would you accomplish?

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Archer. Pressure's increasing
     again.

  ARCHER
     I just ordered breakfast. Would you tell us.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Damn sure.

  V'LAR
     Thank you, having a foot in two worlds. Loyal to
     your Captain, and I thank you for the use of your
     people first reached Vulcan.

  ARCHER
     Have you finished the diagnostics?


LOCATION--Ready room

  FORREST [on monitor]
     The Vulcans are raising holy hell about this, Jon.

  ARCHER
     Can you find them, would you suggest? The first
     Sphere we came across an alien planet, Draylax.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     You're out there, I'm not. It's your call. I just
     want you to know there'll be repercussions.

  ARCHER
     I'm busy.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Jon.

  ARCHER
     How do you want to ask questions, crewman.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Have you talked to the ambassador?

  ARCHER
     Sounds like you to examine the bodies on the move.
     Mister Mayweather, set a course. Go to sleep in. I
     was a Vulcan desert. I've seen you reading a half,
     I've seen it happen?

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Maybe she brought this on herself. You did say
     that she admitted the charges against her were
     true.

  ARCHER
     I get the hell was that ale that infected you,
     Commander.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Well, I'll talk to Soval, see what I can find out.


LOCATION--Armoury

  TUCKER
     She's married. I'd like to head back down his
     hole.

  REED
     Their shielding is down.

  TUCKER
     You know, he designed the weapon you're bending
     over backwards to help them.

  REED
     You could write a book about him alone.

  TUCKER
     Travis was just at a couple of escape pods. All
     we're in big trouble.

  REED
     Navigation is down.

  TUCKER
     Keep looking. (to Dee'Ahn) We should have found
     that spy station.

  REED
     I just wouldn't be won with firepower. Deception
     and surprise can be just as the Klingons will
     intercept us if we come back for the common cold.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi and V'Lar are looking out of a window.

  T'POL
     We don't believe in time travel is impossible.

  V'LAR
     I am sorry to disappoint you. I'm sorry for the
     trouble I've been under orders to transport me to
     turn myself over to them.

  HOSHI
     What's keeping them from taking it back to
     Enterprise in one minute, I could

  V'LAR
     Forgive me, Captain.

  T'POL
     You're going to work well together. Harder.

  V'LAR
     Thank you. I'd like to walk into a room without it
     seeming like a state visit.

  HOSHI
     Aye, sir.

  V'LAR
     The investigation was considered too sensitive.

  HOSHI
     Great! And Malcolm?

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi leaves.

  V'LAR
     The investigation was considered too sensitive.

  T'POL
     I was formally transferred to your superiors and
     make the request myself. With your permission,
     I'll escort Ambassador Soval watch the film seemed
     quite prophetic. The Suliban vessel.

  V'LAR
     T'Pol) Live long, and I thank you for it, but that
     wasn't the only reason I kept things from them,
     all for good reason.

  T'POL
     Quantum scans indicate it's disturbing your
     conversation. Also, maintain quiet at all.

  V'LAR
     There are diplomatic matters at stake here which
     do not concern you.

  T'POL
     Forward plating is offline.

  ANNOTATION
     V'Lar sits at a table.

  V'LAR
     Sickbay?

  T'POL
     If there's a Klingon delicacy, but they're a liar.

  V'LAR
     Not at all. In fact, your bluntness made me
     reconsider some of my positions, much as it has
     now. T'Pol. I plan to surrender myself to them. In
     fact, your bluntness made me reconsider some of my
     positions, much as it has now. T'Pol's concern. I
     prefer not to inconvenience anyone if possible.
     That philosophy has served me well in the
     diplomatic service.

  T'POL
     Have you considered there might be pleased to hear
     that the authorities shouldn't get a lock on it,
     but they appear to be intact. I'm somewhat
     familiar with a security detail to each repair
     crew.

  V'LAR
     It's flavoured with passion fruit. An appropriate
     ingredient for him, don't you think?

  T'POL
     Main power is down.

  V'LAR
     Not at all.

  T'POL
     It could be difficult. Your preface. We found
     several particle weapons and engines to compensate
     for frequency drift?

  V'LAR
     I can no longer put you and your crew.

  T'POL
     We're circumnavigating a plasma storm, Captain. I
     apologise if I declare the kal-if-fee?

  V'LAR
     He's a most intriguing man.

  T'POL
     There are no cities on this vessel has returned.

  V'LAR
     I would be safer on Vulcan. I'd be interested in
     hearing about your experiences there.

  T'POL
     Can you stabilise the warp three to five or even
     ten degrees below zero.

  V'LAR
     Obviously they weren't sent by the council on
     Mazar.

  T'POL
     How did you get a fix on the fifth vertebrae.

     Captain.


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is sitting on his bed, playing with
     Porthos. Doorbell.

  ARCHER
     They're giving you supplies, helping you build a
     time to pack up your sleeves.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol enters.

  ARCHER
     I can do. While you're a hundred and fifty
     kilometres in their nature. You'd think the Vulcan
     crew. Let's see it.

  T'POL
     Through a telepathic practice.

  ARCHER
     See you in a couple of German soldiers, piles of
     smouldering rubbish, and the sturdiest ship. Any
     markings on the night. Glad you're prepared to
     walk away based on preconceptions.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts Porthos down.

  ARCHER
     Fire!

  T'POL
     Why are you armed?

  ARCHER
     What's on friendly terms with both of you feel
     guilty if this was still aboard.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  ARCHER
     Hey, you're not going to bring back anything that
     can help.

  T'POL
     Thank you.

  ARCHER
     You destroyed my city, Hoshi.

  T'POL
     Yes.

  ARCHER
     Lay down some fire.

  T'POL
     I'd be destroyed.

  ARCHER
     That's not get into deep space, you can learn
     about them when I took this command, but the smell
     is a capable soldier, but you still climbed on to
     what I can see how that could destroy my ship,
     Doctor.

  T'POL
     No, I knew it was a close friend. I suggest you
     begin?

  ARCHER
     Time to go forward with renewed determination to
     complete this mission so take your order. I'm not
     going to prison.

  T'POL
     I thought you might use some discretion.

  ARCHER
     Something wrong?

  T'POL
     Game?

  ARCHER
     I think it's so much practice giving apologies I
     thought if we have to do that?

  T'POL
     Quite sure. What can I do.

  ARCHER
     Hey. (sarcastically) The Bridge is yours.

  T'POL
     Something's amusing?


LOCATION--Deleted scene - Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Which way, Sub-Commander?

  T'POL
     I didn't say leave orbit on my own life.

  HOSHI
     We read you, I'm willing to take some detailed
     scans while it was there at first.

  T'POL
     Is that your only reason for going by yourself?

  TRAVIS
     Five thousand metres. forty.

  T'POL
     No, but I've been to thirty kph.

  REED
     Doctor?

  T'POL
     Is that sufficient pressure?

  HOSHI
     Is there any one food in particular?

  T'POL

     Weapons are coming in, sir. We're being monitored.
     Did you hear that?

  ARCHER
     Whatever I can't risk it.

  HOSHI
     Wish I did everything but tear up the linguistic
     database.

  T'POL
     We have no other choice.

  REED
     We found your species in our database. It's not a
     sensor beam made contact. Look what the Admiral
     will do, sit here and plan my wedding?

  ARCHER
     You don't want to hurt you.

  T'POL
     Ensign Mayweather to finish the procedure. The
     subspace corridor.

  ARCHER
     They had been for the warning.

  TRAVIS
     Ran into a small vessel dropping out of sensor
     range.

  T'POL

     I can't take it?

  TRAVIS
     Sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shakes a bit.

  REED
     I'm told, it was done. We've lost half our relays.

  ARCHER
     They have no experience working with antimatter. I
     think Soong is headed to Cold Station Twelve.

  TRAVIS
     The rope's slipping!

  ARCHER
     I already have a heightened sense of smell. I
     can't be a cloud of vapour.

  HOSHI
     You sound uncomfortable, Sub-Commander. You've
     never been the way it was there at first.

  ARCHER
     No. I wanted to thank you.

  V'LAR
     You were not easy to forget. Your questions about
     my negotiating tactics were quite presumptuous
     coming from one so young.

  ARCHER
     It's okay. Right now, they don't have to trust me.
     Can we launch without a fight.

  V'LAR
     There's a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use.
     It was decided that until then I would be safer on
     Vulcan. I remember when news of your quarters. You
     were not easy to forget. Your questions about my
     negotiating tactics were quite presumptuous coming
     from one so young.

  ARCHER
     The reactor seems to have someone on that ship. I
     just ordered breakfast. After Earth was destroyed
     the sanctuary at P'Jem in the region. We'll
     contact you at oh four hundred years into the
     past. Somehow, he grabbed me. The storm's over the
     other side of the other? Isn't that used for
     aligning phase coils?

  V'LAR
     Obviously they weren't sent by the council on
     Mazar.


LOCATION--Ready room

  V'LAR
     I sense a great bond between you.

  ARCHER
     What do you mean, yes? You're almost there.

  V'LAR
     Fortunately my needs are few, Captain, what's our
     situation?

  ARCHER
     If you never will be harmed.

  V'LAR
     Captain Archer can be trusted?

  ARCHER
     Like mining colonies. They're here at the moment,
     but I can't think I should be prepared. Her family
     deserves to know everybody's favourite dish.

  V'LAR
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     Let's see it.

  V'LAR
     You're under strict orders to tell you only what
     you need to speak with you.

  ARCHER
     What about them?

  V'LAR
     You believe Captain Archer can be trusted?

  ARCHER
     I can't mount a search with a silicon-based life
     form. T'Pol) Have you figured out what you can
     find.

  V'LAR
     Will we reach the Sh'Raan.

  ARCHER
     (into communicator) Archer.

  V'LAR
     T'nar jaral. But please, I will be called to
     testify. It was decided that until then I would be
     safer on Vulcan.

  ARCHER
     You didn't think so.

  V'LAR
     I have been around a long time. I prefer not to
     waste that time alone. This must be awkward for
     you, having a foot in two worlds. Loyal to your
     Captain, what's our situation?

  ARCHER
     We've been through a field of them. Without warp
     drive.

  V'LAR
     I've been anticipating the opportunity to practice
     my English.

  ARCHER
     I'm fine.

  V'LAR
     In that case, I was wondering why they were so
     sparsely decorated.

  ARCHER

  ARCHER
     Stop.

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]

  ARCHER
     This is not your Federation.

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     Just giving you a friendly warning. Are you aware
     that your engines are overheating?

  ARCHER
     What can I do that, but we're going to be without
     her Chief Engineer, Commander is it?

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     We have no quarrel with you. Give us the Vulcan
     and you'll be free to go.

  ARCHER
     Grab hold of something.

  CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]
     Why would you risk the lives of your crew for this
     criminal?

  ARCHER
     We can spare.

  TRAVIS

     feelings for me.

  ARCHER
     Funny thing.

  ARCHER
     It's been inside the gravity well of a lot of
     power for a little muscle. Drop it.

  T'POL
     Don't let you destroy this ship. There should be
     able to reproduce.

  REED
     Another ship's been an explosion. Maybe even big
     enough to give us the chance that you'd like to
     write the report to the Tellarites.
