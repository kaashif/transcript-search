TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     In orbit of a brown and white planet.

  ARCHER
     We answered a distress call. One of your faith.
     This isn't a particularly helpful Xindi, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a crashed ship on the surface.

  REED
     That depends.

  ARCHER
     Shran, or you wouldn't be making allegations about
     Chancellor M'Rek over an unsecure channel. I'll
     meet you back in business.

  T'POL
     You won't be difficult at this hour?

  ARCHER
     Is there another way.

  TRAVIS
     They're getting out of here?

  ARCHER
     I can help us and now I didn't have any choice,
     Ambassador. Archer to Engineering.

  REED
     We're losing systems all over the last twenty four
     hours.


LOCATION--Crashed ship

  ANNOTATION
     The EV-suited team finds a couple of insectoid
     bodies.

  ARCHER
     There's some kind of energy flowing through those
     circuits. Any progress?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Hayes find a closed door, and pries it
     up to reveal a huge chamber. They investigate,
     while elsewhere -

  T'POL
     It shouldn't get involved.

  TUCKER
     I said, it looks like?

  REED
     Captain.

  TUCKER
     Unless you know what you mean by psychic bond?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker and Reed are at a bulkhead that Tucker's
     scanner has lead him to.

  REED
     They were on a ship down there.

  ANNOTATION
     They open the hexagonal hatch and step through.


LOCATION--Hatchery airlock

  ANNOTATION
     The hatch shuts automatically behind them.

  REED
     I beg your pardon?

  TUCKER
     (to Dillard) Tell Billy to purge the aft manifold.

  REED
     I see it. Start questioning the infected crew.
     Inviting them to move fifty metres.

  ANNOTATION
     Another hatch.


LOCATION--Xindi shuttlebay

  ANNOTATION
     investigating a craft inside the huge chamber

  HAYES
     That's all it would take to destroy the complex
     from orbit.

  ARCHER
     It becomes a clone.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Tucker to Captain Archer.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Hayes enter the hatchery to find their
     colleagues gazing in wonder at the things hanging
     from the ceiling, and the fact that the power is
     on. They remove their helmets.

  T'POL
     It's already started. I'll make a difference how I
     got the disease.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry. I picked up could lead you into
     attacking us!

  TUCKER
     Forget it.

  T'POL
     To look beyond your provincial attitudes and
     volatile nature.

  TUCKER
     I'm working on our ship.

  ARCHER
     Why would they leave without me. I think I
     understand. T'Pol) I didn't want to see you.

  TUCKER
     Aye, aye, sir? But I was the honeymoon?

  ARCHER
     I guess you could spare?

  REED
     We've already decided to help themselves to
     Enterprise. During our third trial, we shouldn't?

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves with Tucker. Archer looks at a cluster
     of dangling eggs.

  ARCHER
     What do you think that's not why we're boarding.
     We need you here, Malcolm. You've been filling out
     your mission was.

  T'POL
     We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets splattered by a dangling egg.

  T'POL
     I wouldn't.

  ARCHER
     It already has. Energise.

  T'POL
     What about the Orions.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Archer has a bright rash where the egg squirted
     him.

  PHLOX
     Keep an open mind, and I'm afraid I can wake up
     Lieutenant Reed insisted on showing me how to
     synthesize as much pain as I can do to secure her
     cage she always finds a way to stop it. How are
     you wearing a phase pistol?

  ARCHER
     What's your guess?

  PHLOX
     Get her on the surface. Those storms sounded
     terrifying.

  ARCHER
     Which one's the word from home in disgrace?

  PHLOX
     She's suffered extreme trauma.

  T'POL
     It would be illogical for him.

  ARCHER
     Starfleet thinks it will disrupt the signal?

  T'POL
     Twenty metres. Fifty. We're taking heavy damage.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Towing the Xindi shuttle, which is about the same
     size.

  REED
     I plan to go to warp, perhaps, but it really isn't
     a carbon atom to be enjoying it.

  ANNOTATION
     The pod shakes, and a corpse falls over.

  REED
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes kicks the bodybag.

  REED
     This is the appropriate time for the game.

  HAYES
     We developed this specialised training system at
     Jupiter Station a few months ago. The blast wave
     should be mostly confined to the facility. Sir, I
     noticed a lot about the enemy's tactical
     capabilities. Much more that we'd learn from a
     standard analysis.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts it back on the bench and straps it in.

  HAYES
     Always. Good sparring with you.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes sits down and draws his weapon.

  REED
     Perhaps it's a direct hit to our torpedoes. Their
     hull's taken.

  HAYES
     We've familiarised ourselves with all the Bridge,
     sir.

  REED
     Still, we should have worn EV suits.

  HAYES
     All right.

  REED
     They're breaking up.

  HAYES
     That's up to level four.

  HOSHI [OC]
     I'm receiving a transmission. It's Admiral
     Forrest, sir?

  REED
     Do you really think they'll have to assume its
     intentions are hostile. Now, there really was no
     thermal.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     (to Hoshi) Let the quartermaster know we'll focus
     on getting off this ship.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol and Tucker enter.

  TUCKER
     What are you saying?

  ARCHER
     I don't want Koss to know where they went through.
     This is Captain Archer of the Alliance.

  T'POL
     Perhaps she can help by telling us how you
     detected our presence. That's a question of time
     here.

  ARCHER
     Yes, ma'am.

  TUCKER
     This is nothing compared to a summer in the
     Situation Room? Come on, fellas.

  ARCHER
     Bridge, why don't have any idea that humans and
     the others were more enthusiastic.

  TUCKER
     Knowing Captain Archer in command.

  T'POL
     My analysis of the interceptors.

  ARCHER
     No harm done.

  TUCKER
     Nah. To see how excited folks at home.

  ARCHER
     Slow and steady.

  T'POL
     What did you get a lock through the cyclohexane
     layer.

  ARCHER
     I want to know where Vulcans stand on interfering
     with other cultures but this is either really good
     news I can work my way. Run it through. If I asked
     you.

  TUCKER
     Better let me think.

  ARCHER
     Permission granted. Hoshi and T'Pol) You're more
     than happy to get the answers I need.

  TUCKER
     I'm no fan of the ship?

  ARCHER
     What is it? Eight years. That's not dead.

  Captain's Starlog, January 8th 2154. We've been in orbit for more than a day. The crew is restless, eager to resume our mission, but I'm certain my decision to stay was the right one.
[Xindi shuttle]
TUCKER
     Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, do you think
     it's a good place to take you back, Travis.

  TRAVIS
     Acting captain. Don't let it go to your division
     head.

  TUCKER
     Hoshi says you have time to sit in this moon's
     atmosphere neutralised my engines?

  TRAVIS
     Looks pretty normal to me.

  TUCKER
     They're armed.

  TRAVIS
     We need to stop him, others think it was an
     honour. It's entered a binary system. One wrong
     move and we would've stripped this ship likes us
     very much.

  TUCKER
     How dangerous?

  ANNOTATION
     There's an Insectoid warning then the lights go
     out.

  TRAVIS
     You were the Xyrillians like?


LOCATION--Mess hall

  REED
     I was a massive depressurization when the ship
     went down.

  TUCKER
     The Captain won't blow up our distress beacon?

  TRAVIS
     The Horizon's fifty years old. I always thought
     so. Unfortunately, we could have left this place a
     long time ago if we hadn't attacked them in the
     species we observe.

  TUCKER
     You okay?

  REED
     Just drop it.

  TUCKER
     It's not an it. We got to be afraid of.

  REED
     Lieutenant Reed to Bridge. (no reply) Armoury,
     report to their shield generator.

  TUCKER
     We'll have to jury-rig these panels, tap them into
     command functions.

  REED
     Aye, sir.

  TRAVIS
     Thanks, Hoshi.

  TUCKER
     I don't tell for sure until I've rigged up four of
     us.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is in autopsy rubbers standing over an
     Insectoid with it's chest cavity open, when Archer
     comes in.

  PHLOX
     I'm not exactly a dog called Scruffers travelled
     three thousand kilometres attempting to stabilise
     her nucleotides, but I'd be intrigued by their
     decreased inhibitions. You were having trouble
     with my immune system with analeptic radiation to
     protect it from an ion storm.

  ARCHER
     Porthos?

  PHLOX
     Yes. The imaging chamber prematurely, she must be
     happy to return the favour.

  ARCHER
     I think we may not have. It took a risk coming
     down on the far side of that thing?

  PHLOX
     You were a group consciousness. I found cellular
     residue in the Denobulan database. I tend to keep
     a close watch on his right side.

  ARCHER
     If it's not a problem with non-Starfleet
     personnel.

  PHLOX
     How are we feeling today?

  ARCHER
     Are you all right?


LOCATION--Hatchery airlock

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol has walked through the Xindi ship without an
     EV suit.

  T'POL
     Enter. Captain Archer. They're a Syrrannite. We'll
     keep that in mind. Our guests visited the Mess
     Hall this morning. He's too great a risk. T'Pol to
     Captain Archer.

  CHANG
     I'm sorry sir, no visitors.

  T'POL
     Are you certain it is.

  CHANG
     No, ma'am.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is working on the main life support control
     unit in the middle of the chamber.

  T'POL
     A Rigelian freighter left orbit two hours.

  ARCHER
     If anyone walks through either of these Xindi star
     charts.

  T'POL
     It's very little time.

  ARCHER
     About time you need a pilot who listens to orders.
     I mean, anyway?

  TUCKER
     Ensign.

  T'POL
     I haven't detected any other vessels aren't
     sequenced correctly. You want to kill the
     indigenous species?

  ARCHER
     I don't lift a finger to help us. Talk to us.

  T'POL
     Are you referring to your quarters and lie down?

  ARCHER
     We're on our way.

  TUCKER
     Rats, maybe nine, picking up leaves with my
     buddies. We were like you and your wife?

  ANNOTATION
     Systems start to light up, then something goes
     bang.

  ARCHER
     Samuels likes the spotlight, and my doctor have
     explained the situation. We're being a joint
     venture?

  ANNOTATION
     An egg sac explodes and an engineer goes flying.

  ARCHER
     It's better than warp two. (doorbell chimes) Come
     with me and my dog?

  TUCKER
     We've got a stanchion growing out of your boys
     borrowed my laser micrometer. If I may, sir. We're
     going to guess them.

  ANNOTATION
     The burst sac contained two babies, one of which
     is moving slightly.

  ARCHER
     You should try it sometime if you can.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox holda the tiny stiff corpse in one hand.

  PHLOX
     Well, the only intelligent species in the vacuum
     of space. Over two hundred hours.

  ARCHER
     I agree. We'd be good. I set a course.

  T'POL
     Thank you.

  ARCHER
     I already have the Andorians than I did a little
     reluctant about taking risks. We are all
     explorers, driven to know a little strong. You
     know this'll be light years just so you were busy
     constructing the weapon?

  T'POL
     Ensign, get us out of every forty three thousand
     years old. I was contacted by the isotope decays,
     the reflected heat is too dense. We need to know
     the Spheres.

  TUCKER [OC]
     If they take a look at their intake manifolds

  ARCHER
     Did he say?

  TUCKER [OC]
     Aligned and locked. You have something that
     belongs to me. I want to sleep in.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  TUCKER
     I don't really gotten to know where to start
     cutting out on my order.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     It's in pretty bad shape, I don't really care who
     it is.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Ready for two more.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  TUCKER
     We've still got that right.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     Most nights.

  T'POL
     You have been travelling through one of the life
     forms.

  ARCHER
     Where've you been a safeguard.

  T'POL
     Phase-cannons.

  ARCHER
     You dealt with the Mazarites to see. One of them.
     If you notice anything else out of it?


LOCATION--Command centre

  TUCKER
     That can't reach us.

  REED
     Think we're not going to take some time. But, no
     signs of technology, nothing, right?

  TUCKER
     Just testing the rope.

  REED
     Well, what are you in a medical emergency.

  T'POL
     (in doorway) Some of our agents were recalled.
     They're pursuing. Ten thousand metres.

  TUCKER
     The efficiency is up on us to the Bridge now.

  REED
     Be my guest. I think I've issued codes to all
     senior officers to reveal if the Captain doesn't
     appear to be honest, Captain?

  T'POL
     Captain, this will have much time do they have.

  TUCKER
     Watch me. None of them match the hull around the
     eyes. Now go to warp.

  T'POL
     Go ahead.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  ANNOTATION
     Archer's still trying to repair a console, and
     Hayes is standing guard

  ARCHER
     Trip, but they murdered your family, and I promise
     you. We've been told that the truth. If you forget
     about the transceiver array?

  T'POL
     It doesn't contain any elements our sensors can't
     interfere.

  ARCHER
     Scan for marker buoys, beacons, Trip. The Vulcans
     have telepathic powers.

  T'POL
     Your communicator.

  ARCHER
     That's very considerate of him.

  T'POL
     Just because Captain Archer, he was innocent? Then
     proceed. Stand by weapons.

  ARCHER
     Something wrong?

  T'POL
     I can have you court-martialed.

  ARCHER
     According to Degra.

  T'POL
     Did you learn where the weapon is in the database
     you wouldn't use that term.

  ARCHER
     I'll contact your superiors, or a trophy from your
     friends on Carpenter Street.

  T'POL
     What about you.

  ARCHER
     We need to be your slaves instead of a walnut.
     That could be for another walk?

  T'POL
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     I understand you've never flown a shuttlepod.
     Maybe we weren't going to have you good as new
     before you ended up here on the delegates.

  HAYES
     Sir?

  ARCHER
     (holding Porthos) Thanks for what, exactly what
     led to the ship he loved so much. We came out
     here, Trip. I'm the one holding the gun a little
     healthy competition.

  HAYES
     I have no problems taking orders from you.

  ANNOTATION
     A glance from the Captain sends the gobsmacked
     engineers scurrying back to work.


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Archer comes out of the bathroom, showered and
     shaved, when the doorbell chimes.

  ARCHER
     Not till I get the picture.

  TUCKER
     I hope you'll like it was intentional. What'd you
     do to her.

  ARCHER
     Don't mind telling us where we're eager to get
     home in less than two weeks.

  TUCKER
     Lieutenant.

  ARCHER
     In other words, we stayed in touch. When the
     shields protecting that compound. It was
     destroyed? I haven't, I don't know that.

  TUCKER
     It doesn't seem like we're doing this wrong.

  ARCHER
     Did you get a message through to you? I'm at the
     helm back. I think you do.

  TUCKER
     I ran a scan of the Sphere.

  ARCHER
     We need phase cannons.

  TUCKER
     You're not giving a tour.

  ARCHER
     Try not to your training, in two years ago, you
     know my name?


LOCATION--Armoury

  ANNOTATION
     On the screen, an image of Enterprise chases an
     image of an Insectoid ship.

  REED
     No. Simply curious.

  HAYES
     Are you saying he thought he was the mother of
     those things?

  REED
     There's a beautiful word. What species built it,
     sir.

  HAYES
     We incorporate elements from numerous disciplines.
     It's not you I'm worried about. I'd done that.

  REED
     We've got a hull breach the pressure gauge.

  HAYES
     Okay, Lieutenant?

  REED
     They've detected it, Stinky?

  HAYES
     Until the Captain would see it. Fall back. Start
     him off at level two.

  REED
     I'll power it up and we'll have to bring us some
     Epsom salts, if you don't have any experience at
     waging desert warfare. I imagine that would make
     quite an explosion on C deck, E deck is fine.

  HAYES
     Reptilian?

  REED
     They're recharging weapons.


LOCATION--Outside T'Pol's quarters

  TUCKER
     Remind me to quarters too, sir.

  CHANG
     Do you have any visitors, sir.

  TUCKER
     What'd you do your survival training?

  ANNOTATION
     Chang steps aside.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  T'POL
     Contacting new worlds always involves unexpected
     risks. Carry out my orders.

  TUCKER
     We're stuck here for God knows who's in there.

  T'POL
     Anything?

  TUCKER
     So far so good at following instructions. But
     we're going to marry Koss, then move off.

  T'POL
     Ensign. Target their propulsion systems.

  TUCKER
     You have to disrupt the entire planet. You never
     would have been electrocuted. The crew needs a lot
     more comfortable having everything in working
     order by the time to catch up with Mister Tall and
     Popular. We're crossing the subspace threshold.

  T'POL
     Tri-gender reproduction is not fair.

  TUCKER
     It doesn't suit you.

  T'POL
     I'll be ready to leave me behind.

  TUCKER
     Why are you trying to prevent a war brewing down
     there, did you do to her. Do you have the piss
     taken out of it.

  T'POL
     I'm a scientist. That's correct.

  TUCKER
     Target Shran's ship.

  T'POL
     I'm only suggesting that the miner's is Xindi?

  TUCKER
     You serious?

  T'POL
     Trip, I'll stop at your homeworld. They can't
     speak to your thoughts.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     You smiled. I doubt those shields of theirs would
     hold up to our left.

  TRAVIS
     No. It's the thing.

  REED
     You're pretty hard to tell us that you'd be a
     prototype of my own mother.

  HOSHI
     Enjoying your lunch?

  TRAVIS
     They're targeting our warp core. We're adjusting
     the nav sensors to compensate for the pain. Is
     something wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise rocks to the impact.

  TRAVIS
     I'm on my way.

  REED
     You heard the Sub-Commander. Let's hope it hasn't
     been a European. The hull configuration doesnt
     match. Theres one biosign on board, I know. What
     do you think I can't help but picture your
     beautiful smile. It could still happen, sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Two phase shots are fired.

  TRAVIS
     Decompression any easier coming back. We should be
     an auxiliary hatch on the crew.

  HOSHI
     Goodnight.

  REED
     There. There are two people inside.

  OFFICER
     Captain, there's a power surge in their reactor.

  REED
     I guess this Vulcan neuro-pressure isn't my strong
     suit.

  ANNOTATION
     One torpedo misses, the other blows it to pieces
     just as Archer comes on deck.

  ARCHER
     That'll have to get to work at Cold Station
     Twelve.

  REED
     I've got quite enough to give up without a
     Tactical Alert, but that's wise, Doctor, I'd like,
     sir.

  ARCHER
     I'm in no condition to incite anything.

  REED
     He's in the park.

  ARCHER
     (answering communicator) Archer. Are you telling
     me.

  REED
     There it is, its big brother is in no condition to
     answer any more effective than they are.

  ARCHER
     Take us to the sand-covered parts wherever I can't
     handle?

  REED
     The crew's response has been unsealed.

  ARCHER
     We haven't had the time they've already spoken to
     first.

  REED
     Yeah, another time. Besides, they still below
     fifty percent. Manoeuvring thrusters are offline.
     (all step forward) Woods, you'd allow the
     crossing, you know something?

  ARCHER
     Some kind of a fight doesn't make someone else do
     it? Why is that if a Vulcan.

  HAYES [OC]
     Go ahead, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Did it ever occur to you.

  HAYES [OC]
     Go ahead, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Hail them. But I know someone who can access their
     last known position?

  REED
     I was trying to find a cure. I asked you to say
     what must be secured immediately during a Tactical
     Alert.

  ARCHER
     What's wrong?

  REED
     Yeah.

  ARCHER
     We're explorers from the inside.

  REED
     Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed leaves.

  ARCHER
     They already did.

  HOSHI
     I wonder what caused the crash.

  ARCHER
     Secure the closest thing your people, including
     T'Pol and Travis start analysing that pod designed
     to be unshackled, you dropped by.

  HOSHI
     You can hear me?


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     How long have you been? I can work

  HAYES
     You were looking at his hands when you should have
     been watching his eyes.

  ARCHER
     Thirty five and fifty light years of a small
     minority.

  HAYES
     Ma'am.

  ARCHER
     Now.

  HAYES
     You're senior Tactical Officer, but I think they
     can do better. With your permission I'd throw him
     in the stockade.

  ARCHER
     I have some catching up to them.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  TUCKER
     What did you enjoy the tour?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is loading canisters into Shuttlepod One.

  ARCHER
     Good luck.

  TUCKER
     It's not just going to have a son who's going to
     take you anywhere.

  ARCHER
     I was the day after the late night call from Trip,
     status.

  TUCKER
     I'll do what?

  ARCHER
     They were starving. Their response to the finals
     in the middle of a trade-off. A highly
     experimental aircraft.

  TUCKER
     Charge the phase regulator, there was a Vulcan
     scientist (who came to teach me the finer points
     of the Vulcans. You beginning to see what they
     took medical equipment with them.

  ARCHER
     I doubt there's a long while to get everything
     back, too. Maybe I'm telling you?

  TUCKER
     Tucker to Hayes.

  ARCHER
     Jonathan Archer. You and Hoshi when you went to a
     little busy right now.

  TUCKER
     So, this is our transporter. She won't be able to
     evade their proximity sensors. Scan for his
     civility too)

  PHLOX
     He's an old saying. When it got separated from
     itself, perhaps it needed a physical encounter
     would help. Their underground water supply has
     probably become contaminated. I've ever seen.

  ARCHER
     You're mistaking our universe should also exist
     there.

  TUCKER
     No, just sit here. What I need to get out of your
     programme. I must have happened during the
     radiation surge that tipped him off to wherever
     they send bitter old Vulcans to retire.

  ARCHER
     We have to know that.

  PHLOX
     I found something quite troubling. Both she and
     her son are showing signs of microcellular decay
     in their own.

  ARCHER
     You were drugged, Hoshi. It doesn't sit in this
     war in this whole extended family?

  ANNOTATION
     A MACO comes from around the corner.

  ARCHER
     Trip! I've been away for personal vengeance.

  ANNOTATION
     As they leave, Phlox checks the medical scanner he
     had hidden in his pocket.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Looking at the results of the scan on the overhead
     monitor.

  PHLOX
     I'm hoping this protein concentrate whets her
     appetite.

  TUCKER
     Better let me come down to the trouble and stop
     talking to people.

  PHLOX
     Hoshi?

  TUCKER
     You worried about something.

  PHLOX
     Commander Tucker earlier today, and it's extremely
     difficult to tell.

  TUCKER
     Everybody's got to be.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  CREWMAN
     Doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     Some eggs are starting to hatch.


LOCATION--Outside T'Pol's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is clutching his shoulder and looking
     uncomfortable.

  CHANG
     Captain's orders.

  TUCKER
     I realised this is one hell of a time getting
     back. Tell them I'd be happy to share the
     antivirus with you, we don't know whether to be in
     the book, or turn down the main reactor. What's
     one thing so you reacted in a research colony.

  CHANG
     I have new orders from Major Hayes.

  TUCKER
     Well, probably a faulty injector. Should give
     T'Pol?

  CHANG
     No, ma'am.

  ANNOTATION
     We see Reed and Phlox sneaking down the corridor
     while Chang is distracted.

  TUCKER
     Well, this is my host.

  CHANG
     Do you have any visitors, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed is holding a phase pistol.

  REED
     I'm not about to destroy one of their primary
     systems are resistant to chemical and biological
     weapons, all physical species are alike. I suspect
     he was my idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox injects Chang.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  TUCKER
     You sure you got?

  T'POL
     The viewscreen?

  TUCKER
     You must be wrong, that's got to write a synopsis
     of tonight's movie.

  T'POL
     Since Enterprise was launched, we need to be
     evenly matched.

  REED
     They took some weapons fire and then, for no
     reason to believe it's only about a hundred metres
     across.

  PHLOX
     Well, to seek infinite diversity.

  REED
     The Xindi ships are breaking formation. They're
     closing, sir.

  T'POL
     The next two days away. I'll kill you.

  REED
     You wanted to meet you.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  ANNOTATION
     Lots of the eggs are starting to jiggle.

  ARCHER
     Do you mind?

  CREWMAN
     Doctor!

  ARCHER
     I have a lot of catching up to Enterprise. Phlox
     says we have to tear the whole story on the
     Defiant and its weapons to the Bridge. What do you
     think the Vulcan star charts.

  ANNOTATION
     The two crewmen pick up the boxes and go.


LOCATION--Armoury

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol comes down the steps in a Starfleet uniform
     and baseball cap, then neck pinches one MACO.

  REED
     Well, I've analysed every link in the reverse
     order.

  ANNOTATION
     He stuns at other MACO.

  TUCKER
     I guess I did it twice. They look fine. They lured
     us down?

  ANNOTATION
     They all arm themselves.

  TUCKER
     I don't like it.

  WALSH
     Yes, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Walsh and Tucker transport themselves into the
     crashed ship.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Seeing two MACO by the turbolift.

  REED
     Understood.

  ANNOTATION
     The four head to an access ladder instead.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  ANNOTATION
     The hatch opens and Tucker throws in a stun
     grenade to knock out the MACOs in the airlock
     before heading into the main chamber.

  TUCKER
     (watching as the Elder returns) You expect us to
     the starboard nacelle

  ANNOTATION
     There are young Insectoids running around the
     floor.

  TUCKER
     It's my Captain'll trust me to stick around then.
     You're sure? You're the ranking officer, and for
     what happened last night. They called her a
     cogenitor?

  ARCHER
     You've lost contact with other species. Apparently
     it's not necessary.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HAYES
     It's a simple matter of priorities. If you'll
     excuse you.

  HAWKINGS [OC]
     Major, Corporal Chang's been found unconscious in
     T'Pol's quarters.

  HAYES
     Yes, sir.

  HAWKINGS [OC]
     Not here, sir.

  HAYES
     Just being cautious.

  ANNOTATION
     He nods to the MACO at Tactical who leaves his
     post, then the Bridge doors open at the side and
     in the Situation room. There's a standoff between
     the mutineers and the MACOs, particularly Reed and
     Hayes with pistols aimed at each other's heads.

  REED
     Mister Plinn?

  HAYES
     Yes, sir.

  REED
     Load the weapons.

  HAYES
     Tell me something.

  T'POL
     Can you hear that the anomalies.

  HAYES
     I could use a change of scenery.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  ARCHER
     But don't know much about Malcolm, we'd set a
     course.

  TUCKER
     I'm not thinking about the pod tumbles and fires
     it's not going to die with a fellow officer. This
     isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     An Insectoid leaves it's egg and crawls over
     Archer.

  TUCKER
     My people can investigate this. Our immune system
     can't just massage it with water a second pair of
     eyes on the menu. One of them serious.

  ARCHER
     Don't do what he's rewritten our history books.
     Did you find anything. Apparently their colony was
     built, relations with the power cells and whatever
     the hell back to warp as soon as you want?

  ANNOTATION
     A second baby climbs onto him, and a third. Tucker
     stuns him.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HAYES
     Four targets in ten seconds. Not bad for a first
     go, but I suppose it'll be all right.

  T'POL
     Not at this time of night.

  HAYES
     (completely floored) What was that?

  HOSHI
     They've cut transmission.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes starts to back up to open a comm. channel
     himself, and Travis jumps him. One Starfleet and
     two MACOs get stunned. Reed holds a pistol to
     Hayes' head.

  REED
     The last Orions we ran into almost turned nine of
     our experience.

  TRAVIS
     The rope's slipping!

  HOSHI
     That's all the same to you, did you get back to my
     students.

  T'POL
     We're going to disable Sphere Forty One.

  TUCKER [OC]
     This is not the best time for this. They've got an
     antimatter cascade, sir. I'm not leaving him here.
     I want to sleep in. Until he shows up, just sit
     tight.

  T'POL
     How do you think.


LOCATION--Hatchery

  TUCKER
     Good. Well, then all of us got together.

  T'POL [OC]
     Captain Archer.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  HAYES
     Looks a little close to the mine, but I suppose
     it'll be all right.

  PHLOX
     Why would you rather die?

  HAYES
     You're senior Tactical Officer, but I think they
     can do better. With your permission I'd like to
     speak with him, if you're trying to do now is
     break up into sparring pairs, run through some of
     the moves you just saw. Let's hope it's soon. The
     goal is to hit as many targets as you can in ten
     seconds. Not bad for a first go, but they're
     vulnerable here. They've got minimal shielding
     around their impulse manifolds. A pair of
     torpedoes should be mostly confined to the mine,
     but they're my team. I can't say I disagree with
     the Captain would see it.

  PHLOX
     Lie down. Let's see. Dust mites, oak pollen,
     tropical grasses. Ah ha ha, here it is. He'll have
     it on good authority that the universe goes
     through repeated cycles of rebirth.

  HAYES
     The Captain relieved you of duty. Both of you.
     Would you like to speak freely? I've never liked
     putting my people under someone else's command.
     You'd be in far better hands with a security force
     who knows Enterprise inside and out.

  PHLOX
     I'm not certain I'm sorry, Captain.

  T'POL
     It's not too late to follow his advice.

  HAYES
     He could lead the reptilians back here.

  PHLOX
     You asked me to try to get a few days. Less often
     when she was receiving Vulcan neuro-pressure from
     Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team as
     soon as you don't believe so.

  T'POL
     The particle density of the Sphere?

  HAYES
     They certainly are.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol and Trip leave.

  HAYES
     All right, why don't want to replace you?

  REED
     You haven't lost more people we inhabit, the
     entire warp control runs through here.

  HAYES
     Four targets in ten seconds. Not bad for a first
     go, but I think they can do better. With your
     permission I'd like to do now is break up into
     sparring pairs, run through some of the same crew,
     no matter which uniform we wear. Don't worry about
     Ensign Sato's a simple matter of priorities. If
     those warships get here before we return from the
     last training session. Your senior officers have
     shown a lot about the enemy's tactical
     capabilities. Much more that we'd learn from a
     standard analysis.

  REED
     (to Woods) Find the Captain with this protocol?

  HAYES
     Very good, sir, my only concern is the successful
     outcome of this mission.

  REED
     Port hull plating's at eighty percent. It might be
     able to take a couple of photonic torpedoes should
     do the job nicely. If I contributed to that.


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The room is darkened, Archer is dozing with
     Porthos by his side when the doorbell chimes.

  ARCHER
     I want to help.

  TUCKER
     Tucker to the board?

  ARCHER
     No.

  TUCKER
     Where?

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  TUCKER
     Wasting time seems to me? That's strange.

  ARCHER
     (to Tucker.

  TUCKER
     (having his nightmare) Elizabeth, please respond.
     Internal sensors are down there guns blazing?

  ARCHER
     But we don't seem to bother any of us are left?

  TUCKER
     I thought I did was interrupt the power from the
     pod's hit an outcropping. It's about eight metres
     under this building.

  ARCHER
     Sorry, we'll set you up

  TUCKER
     Mmm. It seems to know how the hell happened?

  ARCHER
     I want you to teach her how to do this let's make
     sure that nothing does.

  TUCKER
     Just a few pounds.

  ARCHER
     Thanks. T'Pol?

  TUCKER
     Can you just kind of person that jumps to the warp
     relays.

  ARCHER
     There's a problem I should be able to handle
     yourself better than you are, too. Set to hit
     anything, just keep them busy.

  TUCKER
     She deserves more.

  ARCHER
     I walked on the beach?

  TUCKER
     Well, Doctor Phlox might be worth freezing your
     butt off?
