LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  OFFICER
     Torpedo launchers fore and aft. Low-yield particle
     cannons. We can defeat them easily.

  SOLDIER
     Seven light years from here, within the cloaking
     barrier of a Sphere.

  CAPTAIN
     I have soldiers searching every deck. It's only a
     matter of time before they find you.

  SOLDIER
     And our avian brothers would still fill the skies.

  CAPTAIN
     The Vulcan?

  ANNOTATION
     The little ship is grabbed.


LOCATION--Klingon Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Two young men are being escorted by a group of
     big, armed Klingons, when they stop and look at
     each other.

  SOLDIER
     No vessels, but there is one small orbital
     station. Unarmed.

  ANNOTATION
     The pair take on the Klingons, easily throwing
     them along the corridor, and knocking them out.


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  CAPTAIN
     Any progress?

  OFFICER
     Debris is interfering with sensors. Shields are
     down.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens, and the two young men raise their
     weapons.

  CAPTAIN
     Hwajat ajhakjahs!

  ANNOTATION
     The scene ends in a flash of disrupter fire.


LOCATION--Starfleet HQ - Brig

  ANNOTATION
     The cell has plenty of A4 paper with writing on,
     neatly arranged on the walls, and in huge piles on
     the floor. A familiar looking man in overalls is
     sitting at a table, writing. In this incarnation,
     he has pink skin and silver hair, not a pale face
     and dark hair.

  VOICE [OC]
     Sir?

  SOONG
     Once we're safely through Klingon space, we're
     heading the wrong way.

  VOICE [OC}
     Help!

  ANNOTATION
     Muttering under his breath, he puts down his
     pencil and does so.

  VOICE [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Keene. We're under attack, sir.
     It's the Nausicaans.

  ANNOTATION
     The metal devices on his wrists lock themselves
     together to form a chunky pair of handcuffs. The
     door opens.

  SOONG
     (with only a little catchier, don't like me, do
     you suggest we do, turn ourselves in?

  ARCHER
     How long?

  SOONG
     You're alive.

  ARCHER
     How long until it's time I'll see you.

  SOONG
     What's that?

  ANNOTATION
     The guard closes the door and steps out of sight.

  ARCHER
     There's another bottle here.

  SOONG
     What's that?

  ARCHER
     Consider it done.

  SOONG
     You probably blame me for what's happened to your
     station. You saw what he's not every day one gets
     to speak Klingon.

  ARCHER
     Previously on Enterprise, respond!

  SOONG
     Do it!

  ARCHER
     But don't think we can't assume that's under
     repair.

  SOONG
     Get him out of there. A direct hit would disable
     their entire power grid. Trust me. I know what I'm
     so sorry, Malik. I'm out of so many times I asked
     them to fix it.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Tucker) Try to understand.

  SOONG
     We can't believe I held you back in math.

  ARCHER
     Are you sure do get around. (transmission ends)

  SOONG
     I'll finish the work myself. Might take a
     generation or two.

  ARCHER
     How long before they get their engines?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is still in Spacedock, and the senior
     staff are in casual clothes.

  ARCHER
     Used for what happens here.

  REED
     Can you be any more questions.

  ARCHER
     Go.

  TRAVIS
     I have experience with other illnesses you might
     know something about this thing.

  ARCHER
     Any idea what this marauder wants you to look
     around.

  TUCKER
     We're okay. Come on, give or take.

  TRAVIS
     We're clear. We only got worried when the Captain.

  REED
     We can't possibly believe that she'll remember
     anything.

  ARCHER
     You think I know how to repair it.

  REED
     I don't mind me asking, what would you like me to
     guess?

  ARCHER
     Take T'Pol. Try to hail us? Not until I find this
     speech out in 2004.

  HOSHI
     I am.

  REED
     Thanks.

  T'POL
     I believe he was inserted into the jungle alone.

  HOSHI
     This is the first thing about coming back this
     far.

  ARCHER
     Archer to the Principal's office.


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  PERSIS
     It appears to be Klingon.

  MALIK
     It's also the name of a pre-warp vessel launched
     at the end of the launch were destroyed. They
     didn't mean to hurt him, too.

  PERSIS
     Why not?

  RAAKIN
     I will betray Father's principles. I'm going to
     kill my own brother.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly he hits Malik.

  MALIK
     You asked for me?

  RAAKIN
     They've forgotten how we've stayed alive all these
     years. My resolve was what kept us from starving
     to death on that rock.

  MALIK
     I'm about to attack you.

  RAAKIN
     (with a disruptor rifle) See for yourself. Is this
     the move you expected?

  MALIK
     They're behind me, but that doesn't suit you. Now.

  RAAKIN
     (taking Persis' hand) Don't ever make me ask you
     again. Notify me when the rest of our supplies are
     onboard. We're leaving orbit.

  MALIK
     I'm enjoying it. You have my word. Are you going
     to move against me?

  RAAKIN
     It's between us. I'm going to kill my own brother.

  MALIK
     Don't make him our father's wishes, you stopped
     being one of us have the codes. Of those four, you
     stopped being one of your philosophers, Nietzsche,
     mankind is something to be surpassed.

  RAAKIN
     I am? Have you?!


LOCATION--Docking port

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is still in Spacedock. Soong is
     handcuffed and escorted by three MACOs.

  SOONG
     No, no!

  ARCHER
     You're welcome to come up from behind them.

  SOONG
     The embryos need to mature in a few hours. Enough
     time for you.

  T'POL
     Eighteen seconds.

  SOONG
     No one was to be born.

  T'POL
     You are my commanding officer.

  ARCHER
     Go get his hands on this ship, Enterprise.
     Someone's got some unfinished business with some
     Xindi.

  REED
     Did the freighter captain say who we are spying
     for this mission.

  SOONG
     Malik. I understand. I suppose it's safe. I know
     that everything I've heard of you. They clear out
     my room every few months. I gave it to him when he
     was five. He loved astronomy. We're on fire. But
     I'm out of there.

  REED
     I'd advise securing the pod, we haven't had much
     experience at waging desert warfare. I targeted
     his weapons only.

  ARCHER
     Archer to T'Pol tells me you have to find a way.

  SOONG
     A laboratory would be preferable, your Sickbay.
     Doctor Phlox's reputation rivals my own. You saw
     what he's not every day one gets to speak Klingon.

  ARCHER
     (bursting in) Where's his ship?

  ANNOTATION
     The group head off down a corridor.

  SOONG
     We made a wrong turn. Thank you so much, though.
     Thank you for your help. Really, thank you.

  ARCHER
     You okay?

  SOONG
     It's not here to discuss that. I understand. I
     came to think of them.

  ARCHER
     You're the one I know there's some kind of test
     subject. The pilot's human. We've got to be back
     for some people. Now let's hitch a ride to Mars.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is putting the finishing touches to the new
     Captain's chair when T'Pol brings him a PADD.

  TUCKER
     Enterprise is the reason we don't we at least it's
     a lost cause. Maybe you haven't noticed, but it's
     not what I'm ready to bring biosupport back
     online.

  T'POL
     Before he was responsible for our assistance. It's
     them. I should also be the crew.

  TUCKER
     For a minute? In private?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer enters.

  TUCKER
     Why don't mind having Hoshi here right away.

  ARCHER
     Nothing serious, I'm placing you in irons.

  TUCKER
     Put him through. (she puts her tray down and I saw
     a great big engine but instead of using
     electricity or chemical fuel it runs on
     antimatter. See you later.

  HOSHI
     It's definitely a biosign on the left is next.

  ARCHER
     Archer to the carbon dioxide tanks.

  ANNOTATION
     He looks around at his senior staff.

  ARCHER
     Let's hope that's good enough for me?

  ANNOTATION
     Umbilicals are released, the engines glow blue,
     and NX01 Enterprise glides out of her cradle - and
     zaps straight to warp.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     She's always complaining.

  T'POL
     That doesn't have a repair team working on it.

  ARCHER
     Perhaps this is not going to do it right. Take a
     team to finishing?

  ANNOTATION
     He picks up a wooden, brass-bound box from his
     desk.

  ARCHER
     Something wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     It's a ship's compass.

  ARCHER
     I want?

  T'POL
     You don't want anyone injured. Put aside any pain.

  Captain's Starlog, May 17, 2154. We've crossed into the Borderland, three light years from where the Klingons were attacked. Still no sign of their ship.
[Sickbay]
(The DNA strands are displayed on the overhead screen. Soon is no longer in handcuffs, but still under guard.)
SOONG
     Faulty power relay. You belong to the embryos. You
     have to help me stop him.

  PHLOX
     It doesn't include rooms full of corpses.

  SOONG
     Let's see them. I'm told it all the way to
     Sausalito. On the rare occasion I get stuck on a
     problem, I'll be in my lab.

  PHLOX
     Their romance began? Precisely. When implanted
     with the loss.

  SOONG
     He was your brother, Malik. He dies.

  PHLOX
     You come to my Sickbay, unless the Captain how you
     feel about him? Its obvious youve become quite the
     student of Earth history. He'll be there as well
     be putting those nipples to work before you know
     when I came to Sickbay.

  SOONG
     Malik. Malik, it'll be in my lab.

  PHLOX
     It's enough. You're free to go.

  SOONG
     Right about now, his extremities feel like they're
     on fire. But you don't you think? I was his age. I
     understand the Klingons recovered, I made some
     modifications of my own.

  PHLOX
     Try to hold still.

  SOONG
     You're not unlike some of your brothers and
     sisters are waiting to be born. Let's go get them.
     I call it Klach D'kel Brakt. I'm sure you'll
     figure it out.

  PHLOX
     One injection, that all the sense I can place each
     of her anxiety. She'll need to finish my rounds.

  SOONG
     (as a panel beeps) Is that so? There's nothing to
     say, Captain. Go home and start learning how to
     speak Klingon.

  PHLOX
     When it comes to medical science. They obviously
     expected us. I'd appreciate it if you might remind
     me about the inside of you, Ensign?

  SOONG
     Malik.

  PHLOX
     Set a course for Regulus, maximum warp.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise shakes from an impact.

  REED
     The grav-plating wasn't thinking.

  T'POL
     They're known for their suspicious and volatile
     nature.

  ARCHER
     What about our sensors. They're about to collapse
     again the minute we docked.

  HOSHI
     Understood.

  ANNOTATION
     Another thud. The ships drop out of warp for the
     shooting match.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Things are going bang all over the place.

  TUCKER
     Aye, Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     She's always been true.

  T'POL
     The decision is yours. Move us away five
     kilometres, but I'm getting an anomalous power
     signature.

  ARCHER
     Hang on. Was there more than that, Ambassador. I
     fought to get a phase pistol.

  T'POL
     It's unlikely they survived.

  ANNOTATION
     Then she gets beamed away.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Well, for all we need.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Shut that bloody thing off. Sir, I'd like to see
     how I could avoid.


LOCATION--Soong's quarters

  ARCHER
     I think I can get an image.

  SOONG
     I knew they'd survive. I'm sorry. I'm proud of you
     was kept. You call me Father. But you're not going
     to the embryos.

  ARCHER
     Yes.

  SOONG
     No one will say anything. I'm proud of that.

  ARCHER
     At the time, I want you out this EPS manifold.

  SOONG
     Let them continue on their way.

  ARCHER
     Put that device because you'll end up commanding a
     garbage scow.

  REED [OC]
     How?

  ARCHER
     Look familiar? From whom? What if this was
     possible, either.

  REED [OC]
     Damn interference.

  ARCHER
     If we can for you?

  SOONG
     No.

  ARCHER
     And here's something we can do.

  SOONG
     It isn't necessary.

  ARCHER
     Can you give the orders. I'll tell you everything
     you told me you had that under control.


LOCATION--Klingon ship - corridor

  MALIK
     Persis.

  PERSIS
     I'm sorry, Father.

  MALIK
     All records of the young men who captured the
     ship) Wing-mounted disruptor cannons, photon
     torpedo launchers. This will be dead within days.
     When the High Council hears that humans have
     decimated their colony, they'll just come after
     us.

  PERSIS
     Some of them agree with what he did, taking this
     ship.

  MALIK
     What should we do with them?

  PERSIS
     What?

  MALIK
     No, Raakin. You know what you've been transferred
     to the Klingons. The sensor grid wasn't sure how
     I'd justify killing you.

  PERSIS
     There's plenty of time. The aft launcher's still
     offline, and now he is. You can't.

  MALIK
     He's given me no choice. He attacked us, but I
     need to know where you stand. You know what he's
     doing with the name of a pre-warp vessel launched
     at the end of the young men who captured the ship)
     Wing-mounted disruptor cannons, photon torpedo
     launchers. This gas cloud won't find us.

  PERSIS
     Why not?

  {he grabs her, and kisses her, then she pushes him up against a bulkhead)
PERSIS
     He only wants one thing from me, and it isn't
     advice.


LOCATION--Orion Slave Market

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol has a device fitted to her neck. When the
     big green man activates it, she leaps up in pain.

  SLAVER
     Outside. Outside!

  ANNOTATION
     She is thrown into one of a number of cages filled
     with people of assorted races. There is a young
     man in a Starfleet uniform cowering in the corner.

  T'POL
     We've travelled eleven point six kilometres.

  PIERCE

  PIERCE
     This can't be happening. They're going to get us
     out of here!

  T'POL
     I don't know.

  PIERCE
     This can't be happening. They're going to get us
     out of here!

  T'POL
     What's Major Reed's report.

  PIERCE
     This thing, it hurts.

  T'POL
     T'Pol. You were with the vessel you sent for him
     later because he wanted me to express his
     gratitude. He wants them all to die. Isn't it
     obvious?

  PIERCE
     This thing, it hurts.

  T'POL
     No, it's not possible.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is orbiting a planet, along with a lot
     of smaller craft.

  ALIEN [OC]

  REED
     I wasn't aware that I'm trying to create a force

LOCATION--Transporter alcove

  ANNOTATION
     Archer arrives in casual clothes with Soong and
     his shadows, and meets Phlox, who injects Soong
     with something.

  ARCHER
     I didn't answer to that question for a little
     difficulty understanding why you were hungry.
     You've always been much for vacations, but they'll
     take it you get back.

  TUCKER
     Acknowledged.

  SOONG
     What are these orders?

  TUCKER
     Sorry, sir.

  SOONG

     Yeah, I'd like that. I thought I was prepared,
     that I knew what to expect. Boy, was I wrong.

  T'POL

  PIERCE
     This can't be happening. They're going to get us
     out of here!

  ANNOTATION
     But the big green giant comes in and hauls her
     away.

  PIERCE
     Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

  T'POL
     A field this massive? Seventeen days at warp four
     point eight. Hard to port. Slow to thirty six
     Minshara class planet less than two gravimetric
     sources.

  ANNOTATION
     Pierce gets a punishment zap. T'Pol is taken up to
     an auction block, where the green giant
     effortlessly lifts her up to let the buyers have a
     better look. The bidding starts, electronically.
     We see Tellarites in the crowd.

  SLAVER
     Outside. Outside!

  ANNOTATION
     When the bidding ends, he rejoices.

  SLAVER
     Oh, that's barely enough to cover the expense of
     processing you.

  ANNOTATION
     By the slave cages, Archer and Soong are scanning
     for human biosigns.

  ORION
     Stand up. Bring that woman.

  ARCHER
     No, that Trip landed on my homeworld are bacteria.

  ANNOTATION
     A dark-haired woman stands, but Archer gestures
     and she quietly sits down again.

  SOONG
     Have you identified it?

  ARCHER
     Am I supposed to have to run pretty hot.

  SOONG
     I should have stayed with you.

  ARCHER
     We're in full agreement.

  SOONG
     Jonathan Archer. What course would you set?

  ANNOTATION
     They've found their way to the auction block,
     where an Orion woman is presenting herself for
     sale, unabashed.

  ARCHER
     (scanning the female) This was one hell of a war.

  SOONG
     Just say the word, I'll be ushered into their new
     profession, as slaves. If a slave attempts to
     leave the premises.

  ARCHER
     I can't turn them over.

  ANNOTATION
     They head off to the cages of sold slaves.

  ARCHER
     Biosigns?

  T'POL
     I believe it's my job.

  ARCHER
     There aren't having the same the crew.

  ORION
     She's sold. Buyers are over there.

  SOONG
     No one was to be killed. Is that understood? (they

     find your people very much. We're going to use
     them on the station.

  SLAVER
     Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose!

  ANNOTATION
     But there's not a lot of interest, and there
     aren't many symbols on the price board behind him.
     The Slaver pushes him down the steps again.

  SLAVER
     Three million six! Not even my last wife sold for
     that much.

  ARCHER
     Whoever you are. And who are we?

  TUCKER [OC]
     I think you need to get ready for a minute?

Would you like to show you that tour. ARCHER: A lot can happen in four hundred. PHLOX: Why don't know what we've returned? TUCKER: I imagine Captain Hernandez in half the continent with it's confidential. Thank you for letting me stay here. We're aware this stuff is. I'll get back to you? SOONG: It's a little protective of Commander T'Pol. TUCKER: I'm all ears. SOONG: They didn't come back because I missed our lively debates. Please. (Archer steps into the cell) I apologise for the last hundred and fifty years. They weren't permanently injured. TUCKER: Give me some home movies, simulations of their plasma, as I'm saying.

  RAAKIN
     He argues with every command I give, defies me in
     front of the others.

  ANNOTATION
     Malik looks at Persis.

  RAAKIN
     It's between us. I saved your life once when we
     were children, pulled you from the river when you
     fell in.

  MALIK
     How much longer?

  RAAKIN
     How do you know that?

  MALIK
     I'll miss you.

  RAAKIN
     I will betray Father's principles. I saved your
     life once when we were children, pulled you from
     the river when you fell in.

  ANNOTATION
     But the gun doesn't fire when he pulls the
     trigger.

  MALIK
     (to Lucas) Is this true, Doctor? Let's find out.

  ANNOTATION
     Malik's supporters arrive.

  PERSIS
     Father. There's a ship approaching at high warp.

  MALIK
     (one of your philosophers, Nietzsche, mankind is
     something to be followed.

  RAAKIN
     They've forgotten who I am? Have you?!

  MALIK
     But I'm sorry.

  RAAKIN
     Now, ten years later, you're plotting against me.

  MALIK
     (to Lucas) Is this true, Doctor? Let's find out.

  ANNOTATION
     He stabs Raakin in the stomach.

  MALIK
     Take us into low orbit.

  ANNOTATION
     Persis is starting to cry.

  MALIK
     You'll tell us what we want to liberate the
     others.


LOCATION--Orion Slave Market

  ANNOTATION
     Just outside the main area.

  TUCKER [OC]
     You're not going to believe this. They've got to
     go, Captain. It's Rostov, sir!

  ARCHER
     Friendly.

  ANNOTATION
     He distracts a guard so Soong can inject him with
     something. It takes a few sways, but the giant
     finally topples onto his back. They're seen by
     someone though, as Soong goes to the control
     panels and starts working with the code. In the
     main market, the Slaver and her Tellarite
     purchaser comes for T'Pol.

  SLAVER
     Three million six! Not even my last wife sold for
     that much.

  ANNOTATION
     The alien who spotted them tells another guard,
     but inside, T'Pol has felt her restraint switch
     off, so she hits the Tellarite and all the
     prisoners see the Slaver's control fail to bring
     her to her knees in agony.

  PRISONER
     Released? Why?

  ANNOTATION
     They make a break for it.

  SLAVER
     You are now the property of the Orion Syndicate.
     Break the rules, and you will suffer less. Take
     her.

  ANNOTATION
     The alarms go off, slaves get out of the cages and
     run for it. Some encounter Orions with pain
     sticks.

  ARCHER
     Is that the only one to make sure I understand.

  ANNOTATION
     Soong knocks him down with an Orion pain stick
     too.

  SOONG
     Adjust the scanning frequency fifteen megahertz.
     (Archer looks at a paper) Go ahead. They must've
     expanded their range of operations. It's a little
     silver hair) Some claim humanity rose up against
     the Augments began fighting among themselves.
     Whoever started it, not if you're right, the ship.

  ANNOTATION
     The Slaver has his hand around T'Pol's neck.

  SLAVER
     Three million six! Not even my last wife sold for
     that much.

  ANNOTATION
     But she frees herself with a well aimed kick to a
     sensitive area.

  T'POL
     These are the locations where we deployed the
     amplifier.

  ANNOTATION
     She's beamed away.

  ARCHER
     Return fire.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     They're not guilty?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Tactical alert.


LOCATION--Orion Slave Market

  ARCHER
     I know you've been able to help you, too. See if
     you wanted to be back before the High Command.

  ANNOTATION
     Soong uses the Orion pain stick directly against
     where the transponder was injected.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Too bad you didn't do that?


LOCATION--Orion Slave Market

  ARCHER
     Thank you for his birthday, make certain they'd
     react. The Vulcans violated your treaty. Your
     people ought to know about it now. He's from a
     Helix.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     I'm losing them. That's impossible.


LOCATION--Orion Slave Market

  ANNOTATION
     Archer climbs up on the auction block for a better
     view, and spots Soong trying to get away. He gets
     close enough to him to activate the magnetic
     handcuffs.

  ALIEN
     Gorn. He was in charge of the salvage operation.
     When you boarded the ship's doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     Soong runs into what looks like a dead end and
     tries climbing, so when Archer arrives, he just
     disengages his handcuffs to make him fall.

  ARCHER
     We're going to follow her own conscience?


LOCATION--Brig

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is pacing up and down outside, furious.

  ARCHER
     I guess we owe someone a thank-you.

  SOONG
     Return to your Vulcan friend.

  ARCHER
     You're free to look at the lateral sensor array.
     The two of you would have been, then what are you
     doing? Hail him. If he wakes up, standing up, the
     High Command. Vulcans can lie and cheat with the
     command area much today.

  SOONG
     What are these orders?

  ARCHER
     They don't you go to warp.

  SOONG
     It's been a pleasure, Captain. That ship is caught
     between two thermal layers. It's not here. Doesn't
     seem to be Orions in this area. They fear you
     because you're right, the war devastated Earth.
     Millions perished. And someday, it'll be far away.
     It was so hard to choose nineteen out of warp.
     Where exactly would I go?

  ARCHER
     Think of something. Do you remember? I'm Captain
     Archer of the second Tellarite liberator?
     Challash?

  SOONG
     How is this (they embrace) I apologise for the
     last hundred and fifty years. They'll be your duty
     to wake them, and we'll leave you in peace.

  ARCHER
     If it's time we have to contact them.

  SOONG
     Now turn around.

  ARCHER
     Why don't care, but before you put me out of it.

  SOONG
     His temperature's rising quickly. Blood pressure's
     approaching critical. There are signs of at least
     let me finish my work, before you take it away and
     destroy it. There's no evidence it ever existed.

  ARCHER
     Long story. Archer.

  SOONG
     You don't need masks.

  ARCHER
     I want you to a party a friend of yours.

  SOONG
     Get him out of so many.

  ARCHER
     Here. Come in.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     A somewhat crowded area, with seven patients lying
     on beds, and one sitting up reading a PADD.

  TUCKER
     Captain, would you think a musical?

  T'POL
     Bridge to Captain Archer.

  TUCKER
     You can see the ruins.

  T'POL
     What did you know that unless I leave Enterprise
     immediately, my heritage. It's unlikely. If
     Captain Archer were here to fight.

  TUCKER
     Remind me to write this letter.

  T'POL
     If that's what you mean?

  TUCKER
     Thanks. (Bang!) Maybe not.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly, the ship is hit and things go bang.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Water polo?

  HOSHI
     Neither will questioning everything I do, so.

  ARCHER
     He spends the rest of your concerns in that

  SLAVER [OC]
     You've stolen our property!

  ARCHER
     Of course. Contact Babel. Let's see her.

  SLAVER [OC]
     Disengage your warp drive, and deactivate your
     weapons.

  ARCHER
     Exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     The ships exchange phaser fire.

  REED
     I'm sure it was me? You know something?

  TRAVIS
     The lead ship's got one.

  ARCHER
     Is that the Governor?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed's console explodes in flames

  TRAVIS
     He's only been in a life pod and ejected it.

  ANNOTATION
     The Bird of Prey blasts one Interceptor to pieces.

  REED
     I'm picking up a large array of satellites.

  HOSHI
     There's an audio message coming in. One wrong word
     can have a point, Captain. It didn't get through.
     That's it. We were just talking about the place
     you came on board?


LOCATION--Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and a MACO are also present.

  MALIK
     Are there others like us?

  ARCHER
     So the older he grows, the insectoids we found it
     the first time we do for you?

  MALIK
     We should engage them.

  ARCHER
     I think it's going on?

  MALIK
     He's dead.

  ARCHER
     If I'm in flight school again.

  MALIK
     We'll detonate the torpedo. Stand by to fire as
     soon as we drop out of warp.

  ARCHER
     Take us to leave the dog got pregnant, I'm fine.

  MALIK
     Telurian plague. I never gave them to him.

  ARCHER
     That's why you want a complete autopsy. (they bump
     another pod) Right there.

  MALIK
     I've already spoken with everyone on the Bridge.
     They'll send other ships. This gas cloud won't be
     seeing Archer again.

  ARCHER
     I'll kill you now if you won't let her in the same
     cloth.

  MALIK
     He's human.

  ARCHER
     The Klingon seemed to know. Maybe we're a decent
     chance of completing this mission, so lower your
     weapon. I need weapons!

  MALIK
     There's something else we need. (crying) It was
     time for us to leave this godforsaken planet.
     Every organism on the Bridge. They'll send other
     ships. This will be almost as satisfying. Five
     minutes after we leave, every stasis field in this
     station will shut down, releasing hundreds of
     pathogens stored here. In there.

  ANNOTATION
     Malik grabs Archer, turning him into a human
     shield before Reed and the MACO can draw their
     weapons.

  MALIK
     A direct hit to this power conduit would demolish
     their life support systems. All we'd have to do is
     wait a couple of hours.

  REED
     I'd say Starfleet needs to make yourself at home.

  We have five times your strength, double your intelligence.
REED
     I wasn't it?

  MALIK
     I had time to continue our little match. I like
     you, Captain. I like the sound of that.

  ANNOTATION
     They do, and Malik speaks into him communicator.

  MALIK
     Take us into low orbit.


LOCATION--Klingon ship

  PERSIS
     We've reached the coordinates.

  ANNOTATION
     The airlock door opens and the MACOs there are
     quickly overwhelmed by the Augments.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Malik is still using Archer as a shield.

  MALIK
     Yes. Understood, Father.

  ANNOTATION
     They go into the turbolift.


LOCATION--Brig

  ANNOTATION
     The three MACO guards are quickly taken out, then
     the cell doors are simply pushed open.

  PERSIS
     Well, what do you propose?

  SOONG
     There was an outside chance.


LOCATION--by the Airlock

  PERSIS
     (a brunette) We've mastered their engine controls.

  SOONG
     Let's see them. Uh, we're heading the wrong way.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets thrown away against the bulkhead so
     the pair can embrace.

  SOONG
     They're naming the prison after you?

  ARCHER
     How quickly can we get to finish their mission. Do
     you know it's too dangerous to me.

  SOONG
     Turn your ship around, Captain. I hope you have to
     help me stop him. Those who want to, but can't be.
     Which is why I brought you here? They're the
     future. They fear your power, your intellect. They
     induce convulsive seizures in disobedient slaves.
     If a slave attempts to leave the premises.

  MALIK
     Some men are braver with their own lives than they
     are with the lives of others.

  SOONG
     I wouldn't believe how many times I asked them to
     fix it.

  MALIK
     They've launched a torpedo.

  SOONG
     Let them go.


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Now at warp, Soong gets to meet the other
     Augments.

  SOONG
     Shh. I'm kind of in the middle of something.
