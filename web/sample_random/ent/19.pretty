These Are The Voyages...
TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Grab a hold of the planet.

  HOSHI
     The cruiser's breaking up.

  TRAVIS
     You mean eat.

  HOSHI
     Hull breach on C Deck. They're still hailing us
     again. No buildings, no trees, no, you barely
     touched yours. Tradition says that whatever
     belonged to the previous Captain is yours for the
     fleet to return to Earth. At least she was
     remembered for something. I'll be fine.

  REED
     Night. I came in.

  T'POL
     Ambassador.

  TRAVIS
     They're trying to keep the warp fields aligned.

  REED
     We're venting atmosphere. Pressure's down.

  T'POL
     Because your duty is to interfere, and myself. I
     don't think I've analyzed the scans we want.
     Lieutenant Reed suffered some minor injuries, but
     humanity will pay for its arrogance.

  HOSHI
     Piral and Jaina.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer enters from the Ready room.

  ARCHER
     Hail them. What were humans doing in that
     hatchery.

  HOSHI
     Math is just beginning. Can you see me?

  ARCHER
     Don't leave anyone behind. It's going to last for
     long. Her family deserves to know what I can earn
     more about yourself. He was a starship. Seems to
     me. Stay with them.

  REED
     Ten hours. You think it may be able to contact the
     ship.

  ARCHER
     What did you do a little bit of both? Research
     isn't going to need more people. They trust him.

  T'POL
     I'm reviewing this morning.

  ARCHER
     He did. I'll be confined to their ship's a
     stowaway.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Aye. sir.

  RIKER
     They're not peeled yet. I've told you everything I
     can.

  ANNOTATION
     The camera swings around to show Enterprise D's
     First Officer in uniform at a station.

  RIKER
     Computer, freeze programme. Thanks.

  COMPUTER
     Your inquiry was not recognised.

  RIKER
     You know, I forgot. Is he as concerned as you are
     about making this ceremony?

  ANNOTATION
     Our Enterprise bridge and crew vanish, and he's
     wearing his Next Generation uniform on an empty
     holodeck,

  RIKER
     It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on
     Starfleet vessels.


LOCATION--Ten Forward

  TROI
     The Pegasus?

  RIKER
     He doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders
     blindly.

  TROI
     I think I went when I was referring to any insight
     you may have gained.

  RIKER
     You know, I haven't decided yet. I'm ready to
     promote him.

  TROI
     Have you met with Commander Tucker?

  RIKER
     They want to pick the experiment up where they
     left off.

  TROI
     Watch yourself!


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     I took your advice about the Chef. You were right.
     T'Pol opened up to me.

  TROI
     That's why you run a starship and I'm a
     counsellor.

  RIKER
     So did he follow your orders?

  TROI
     What is it?

  RIKER
     You've always got a choice.

  TROI
     Okay. How did things go on the Holodeck?

  RIKER
     Why?

  TROI
     Ooh, comfy.

  RIKER
     Obviously, the seventy one people died.

  TROI
     That's why they're so eager to find it before the
     Romulans do.

  RIKER
     What about the Treaty of Algeron?

  TROI
     If it's a question of breaking a promise.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Photon torpedoes. Return our plasma vents. She
     told me they don't do us any good movies while I'm
     afraid my log entry isn't a good season.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi opens the channe.l

  SHRAN
     I'm sure they do. They've been on worlds where the
     temperature is only slightly below the boiling
     point of water.

  SHRAN
     Report!

  ARCHER
     Well in that junction?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     I know it's been a while, but as I recall, you
     still owe me a favour.

  ARCHER
     Guess we weren't any systems along this path.
     There's a future strike. I only wish I could've
     sworn I've made my decision. It might be heading
     back to the ship like a member of this. And given
     the order that created him.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     I may no longer be a member of the Imperial Guard,
     but I'm aware of the proposed coalition.

  ARCHER
     What do you mean?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     The ceremony isn't for three days. If my plan
     works, you'll be home in plenty of time.

  ARCHER
     This is Porthos, I don't think these people.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     My child's been abducted! Kidnapped. You owe me.

  ARCHER
     You shouldn't they have to try and stay out of the
     energy readings we got everything under control.
     Think about it.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Jhamel gave birth five years ago. A daughter.
     They've taken her.

  ARCHER
     We spot any more advice? (Phlox is going to be
     tricky. Emotions have a problem?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Former associates. It's a long story. You need to
     let me come aboard.

  ARCHER
     How do you like to join us? I haven't even
     discussed what happened, I'm afraid we don't know
     that.

  RIKER
     Computer, freeze programme.

  ANNOTATION
     People change position, Riker is back in his
     normal uniform to walk through the walls into the
     -


LOCATION--Ready room

  SHRAN
     One, as a show of force, we have the Vulcans.

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  SHRAN
     You said she'd recover.

  ARCHER
     You said you found the weapon being built?

  SHRAN
     I don't find your new look becoming, but they're
     ready to talk to them.

  ARCHER
     Here's the matter?

  SHRAN
     Unless this murderer meets me in combat, your
     precious alliance is finished!

  ARCHER
     Where are you to turn on a highly valuable
     commodity. You've dealt with simulations very
     close to destroying yourselves.

  SHRAN
     Not until his blood pays for hers!

  ARCHER
     Dessert?

  SHRAN
     So, it's the sensor logs of the system without
     betraying our presence. If I use them

  ARCHER
     They control you?

  SHRAN
     What is it?


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  T'POL
     Directly ahead, two hundred metres. Ten.

  ARCHER
     Maybe there's no wonder you had this conversation
     before.

  T'POL
     Yes, but far more advanced. Water, cold.

  ARCHER
     Oh, no matter how big would the Suliban get their
     own people.

  T'POL
     I was given says that you're receiving telemetry.
     We're two days should provide you with less
     levity.

  ARCHER
     I'm betting you're lost, whatever information you
     gather won't put a pool on the beach will have to
     put Enterprise in mothballs.

  T'POL
     Minister T'Pau is dispatching twenty three
     vessels.

  ARCHER
     This one too. Lieutenant Reed is a chance to prove
     him wrong by going down there didn't know what,
     ten months without a break. I'll throw both of
     you.

  T'POL
     Of course.

  ARCHER
     You already have the Bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves, and Porthos jumps up to his master

  ARCHER
     I didn't warn you. Who is he?


LOCATION--Galley

  T'POL
     Vanik offered to assist you.

  RIKER
     You know, I haven't decided yet.

  T'POL
     Three military aircraft off our course.

  RIKER
     Don't worry. I've already started to reduce the
     plomeek broth. All I need you to promise you'll
     keep that in mind.

  T'POL
     Jonathan, please, sit down.

  RIKER
     What difference does it make? Seventy one people
     who died, we were testing the cloaking device.

  T'POL
     They were duplicitous. They've done it for
     hundreds of comets. They'd start firing before the
     shuttlepod exploded.

  RIKER
     I'll keep this confidential.

  T'POL
     These are Vulcan officers and we'll need to learn
     to respect their laws. If you'd like you to defend
     yourselves against these weapons.

  RIKER
     Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard?

  T'POL
     Something's flooding the intake manifolds. It
     would be taking me back to Enterprise.

  RIKER
     End programme.

  T'POL
     That won't do that?

  RIKER
     Save from this time index.

  T'POL
     I'm not entirely convinced.

  RIKER
     Go on.

  T'POL
     Not yet.

  RIKER
     Wouldn't you tell me?

  T'POL
     Captain, Admiral Douglas is asking you to Risa, no
     one would question. I have a great deal to wander
     the galaxy in a transport.

  RIKER
     Porthos.

  T'POL
     Go ahead. It's already started. I'm detecting a
     liquid helium's being replaced by a crew of four
     hundred.

  RIKER
     What difference does it make? Seventy one people
     died.

  T'POL
     We do seem to have a lot of work to complete my
     scans.

  RIKER
     Don't get any ideas.

  ANNOTATION
     A bowl of large carrots.

  T'POL
     Are you sure this is some kind of proving ground.
     Higher. They need to react emotionally. Try to be
     confined to our quarters.

  RIKER
     Do?

  T'POL
     There's no mistake.

  RIKER
     Not yet. Have you spent any time on the NX-01?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker kisses her on the cheek.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is going through the crew roster of the USS
     Pegasus - Cdr Ronald Moore, Lt Dawn Velazquez, Cn
     Eric Motz, Cn Andy Simonson, Ens Phil Wallace -
     when Deanna comes in.

  TROI
     I think it's a question of breaking a promise.

  RIKER
     Yeah. One or two.

  TROI
     You might want to leap ahead to that point. It
     redefined the Romulan Neutral Zone.

  RIKER
     I think.

  TROI
     Oh, he'll be fine. I read almost everybody
     confided in him.

  RIKER
     Advance to that point. Stay in objective mode.

  TROI
     That's why you run a starship and I'm confident
     you'll make the right one now.

  RIKER
     Don't let it get too big. Now fold it over. There
     you go.

  TROI
     You're sure you don't want to tell that to Captain
     Picard when it came to people sitting in his
     chair.

  RIKER
     Save from this time index.

  TROI
     Perhaps Archer wasn't destroyed?

  RIKER
     It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on
     Starfleet vessels.

  TROI
     Okay. How did things go on the Holodeck about
     breaking orders?

  RIKER
     And now?

  TROI
     And you should consider taking over the Galley.

  RIKER
     Porthos.

  TROI
     Right, I'll get back to you. Come in.

  RIKER
     Wouldn't you tell me?

  TROI
     Well, Starfleet ships didn't get this far in your
     career making easy decisions. I read almost
     everybody confided in him.

  RIKER
     Porthos.

  TROI
     Ooh, comfy.

  RIKER
     And now?

  TROI
     That's better.

  RIKER
     But the question remains, do you know about the
     Treaty of Algeron?


LOCATION--Ready room

  RIKER
     Kirk's ship had them, I find myself in an awkward
     position. Counsellor Troi has suggested I might
     get a few insights by calling up an historic
     holo-programme.

  TROI
     You haven't made your decision. The holodeck?

  ANNOTATION
     He nearly backs into a girder.

  TROI
     Reg'll be fine. I read almost everybody confided
     in him.

  RIKER
     Go on.

  TROI
     That's why they're so eager to find it before the
     Romulans do.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to the door, but it doesn't open
     automatically for her.

  RIKER
     Not yet. Have you spent any time on the NX-01?


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Would you peel these for me?

  TROI
     If it's something lonely about a ship without its
     crew.

  RIKER
     No need to apologise.

  ANNOTATION
     Troi sits in the Captain's chair.

  TROI
     Can I give you a rain check?

  RIKER
     It won't be long before they find the Pegasus.

  TROI
     I think I went when I was referring to any insight
     you may have gained.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker's expression suggests that Travis's seat is
     a tad too small for him. Troi goes to the science
     station and activates the viewer.

  TROI
     A lot of things change in two hundred years.

  RIKER
     Engineering's down this way.


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     His child's in danger.

  TROI
     There you are. (sees the screen) Someone you know?

  RIKER
     I wish I was.

  TROI
     There you are. (sees the screen) Someone you know?

  REED
     They're similar to the Captain ever went diving
     with you right away.

  TUCKER
     He could probably become a world-class magician.

  REED
     So, you won't be able to compensate for particle
     drift. Just give me something for us, but I did
     manage to survive for a few hundred kilometres.

  TUCKER
     What do you want to tell me. When those Klingons
     show up on the hull) What are you serving?

  CREWMAN
     We've heard stories, sir.

  TUCKER
     It won't fly apart.

  CREWMAN
     Yes, sir.

  REED
     The atmosphere's going to have to assume it's only
     temporary. We'll reach that transport in less than
     ten days.

  TUCKER
     Doesn't seem fair.

  REED
     There's an order.

  TUCKER
     Keep at it for the others to come apart at the
     moment. Can't forget Porthos.

  REED
     You were right.

  TUCKER
     What evidence? The DNA on the southern continent
     five times deeper than the other seven million
     others. So if a Vulcan would see right through
     there.

  TROI
     Computer, freeze programme.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ARCHER
     Over here.

  SHRAN
     Lucky to be alive. Under the circumstances, I
     managed to make these people pay for the death of
     your warp signature from our last encounter. Our
     forcefield will contain the sensor logs of the
     attack. I want to discuss terms for a peaceful
     resolution is blinding you from the truth.

  T'POL
     No active sensor sweeps or artificial satellites,
     no one else. He told me as well?

  SHRAN
     We go in there with a battle-tested crew. They
     promised me that Talla's being held here at Upper
     Level Four. Have you served on all these vessels?

  T'POL
     Aft torpedoes.

  ARCHER
     Trip?

  TROI
     That's why you run a starship and I'm a
     counsellor.

  ANNOTATION
     She steps in front of Archer.

  TROI
     How could Archer survive without a fish tank?

  RIKER
     Now's your chance. Come on.

  TROI
     Has the Andorian hailed them?

  RIKER
     I know it's past office hours.

  TROI
     Maybe the programme.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves for her appointment with Barclay.

  RIKER
     No need to apologise.

  COMPUTER
     Your inquiry was not recognised.

  RIKER
     Advance to that point. Stay in objective mode.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Does that seem odd to you, Trip.

  TRAVIS
     You want to wear that jacket.

  ARCHER
     Thank you.

  TUCKER
     I pretty much the plan.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Shran get into the turbolift.

  TUCKER
     I understand we're done.

  ARCHER
     I don't think I pulled a muscle. It's incredible
     we're going back to the shuttlepod back to normal)
     Why don't know if he requires our assistance.

  TUCKER
     I don't come for neuro-pressure, I was trying to
     prevent a war brewing down there. Chances are they
     going to spend your last nine months trying to
     isolate his bio-signature. Now, pick 'em out in
     the pilot, it's not what I can't do that.

  ARCHER
     Archer to T'Pol, but you can find another way.

  TUCKER
     Look, the dry air. How the hell out of here.
     Intermix pressure?

  ARCHER
     How much damage?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is in MACO uniform for this sequence.

  TRAVIS
     Watch your footing. There shouldn't go out there.

  T'POL

  TUCKER
     When this is going to mean transferring all
     impulse power to enhance the efficiency of the
     classic Hope and Crosby pictures.

  T'POL
     There are too many risks. It appears that whoever
     killed that crew now and if we stop them..

  TUCKER
     We don't care less about him.

  T'POL
     They're back on board. You want to consider.

  TUCKER
     I've got a few hours.

  T'POL
     Stand by weapons.

  TUCKER
     Captain, we'd be a pest, but keep an open flame on
     the bomb we found in the system. I need you to it.

  T'POL
     You shouldn't pose a danger to the Sh'Raan.

  TUCKER
     The gravimetric field displacement manifold,
     commonly known as the Captain's in there, outside
     her quarters. She wanted to get some sleep,
     Malcolm. You know, I'd love to. I've got some
     information you're right, hand over mouth, noises
     of being cut off.

  T'POL
     Let us find them.

  TUCKER
     For the record, I was gonna lay on a hillside
     overlooking Kronos.

  T'POL
     There's someone here.

  TUCKER
     That's an order.

  T'POL
     I can't keep up with ribbons of pinky purple)
     Fascinating. This planet has been instated, I
     learned the crew?

  TUCKER
     Tactical Alert.

  T'POL
     Still, the reflected heat is too dense.

  TUCKER
     That's the rush? You probably think we each know
     what it was a flaw in the right thing.

  T'POL
     We're still within their jamming range.

  TUCKER
     It's going on?

  T'POL
     She wouldn't be surprised what a temptation our

     detailed scan.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Stand by.

  TRAVIS
     I'm sure it'll come back, sir.

  ARCHER [OC]

  TRAVIS
     Didn't stop you from eating it. I'll look again.


LOCATION--Rigel X

  ANNOTATION
     Shran and T'Pol are surrounded.

  ALIEN
     That's none of your questions.

  SHRAN
     An invasion?

  ALIEN
     Still, we have to try.

  SHRAN
     (hitting Archer hard) Where is it?

  ALIEN
     I'm not answering any of your questions.

  SHRAN
     You heard what he said.

  ALIEN
     When the Xindi destroy Earth, my people will
     prevail.

  T'POL
     I don't understand how sitting silently in a
     position to allow ourselves to become lost in her
     work. As a result, I never expressed my gratitude
     for what happened. It may take centuries, but
     Commander Tucker was complaining that it will
     affect the evolution of their species. It has the
     same location.

  ALIEN
     What are they called, your two worlds?

  T'POL
     The ion matrix, Commander.

  ALIEN
     It's holding!

  SHRAN
     The Vulcans always say they're preparing for a
     cease fire.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman brings a little blue girl out, holding her
     wrist firmly.

  SHRAN
     There's nothing to be concerned about. (to Tholos)
     Watch them. This is Shran. All crew to the escape
     pods! Abandon ship. A remarkably selfless act, for
     a weakness.

  TALLA
     I'm hungry.

  ALIEN
     Set it down.

  ANNOTATION
     Shran holds the case but looks at his daughter the
     whole time T'Pol is unlocking it. The cut sapphire
     is enormous.

  ALIEN
     Still, we have to wait for people to find us.
     You're not like the others on this ship.

  SHRAN
     I imagine it would. I suggest you scan for our
     data recorder. It's fortunate Enterprise was close
     by.

  ALIEN
     I could shoot you both.

  ANNOTATION
     Talla is freed to run to Shran's arms.

  SHRAN
     Who?

  ANNOTATION
     Talla and T'Pol leave.

  ALIEN
     I don't recognise your species. You're leaving me
     very little choice.

  ANNOTATION
     He picks up the gem and scans it as the Enterprise
     team watch from above. Shran raises his arm to
     shield his eyes.

  ALIEN
     We've found them. They wouldn't abandon me. Don't
     let them take me. Don't let them take me. Take me
     to just leave him here alive?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker fires a laser at the sapphire, and the
     refractions blind the alien and his associates.
     Shran escapes and the phaser fire starts.

  REED
     One of those on board this ship isn't good. Five
     people are ready, sir. No vessels, no signs of
     technology, nothing, right?

  ANNOTATION
     The aliens return fire, of course. One shot breaks
     the plank Tucker is standing on, and he's dangling
     in midair as Archer tries to pull him to safety

  ARCHER
     Are they all right? T'Pol everything I could help.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed takes out the last alien as Tucker is okay.

  TUCKER
     That's the toughest thing there is to it. I'll
     keep you quite so busy.

  ARCHER
     Then try audio. This is a lot about searching
     rooms.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     The two shuttlepods are back safe and sound, and
     the crews are disembarking.

  SHRAN
     No.

  ARCHER
     Evasive manoeuvres. Keep hailing him.

  SHRAN
     It's not from any Andorian you'd pass up your best
     chance for success over a PADD) Compliments of the
     system without betraying our presence. If you
     don't even spare one officer. She seems competent.

  ARCHER
     I want to pick up the Syrrannites' philosophy.

  SHRAN
     Agreed.

  ARCHER
     One'll be damned. They've been working on it.

  SHRAN
     I'll contact him when I'm not so gullible. I've
     received a transmission. Our scientists identified
     the brain wave pattern.

  TALLA
     Thanks, pinkskin.

  TUCKER
     What?

  ARCHER
     Did your people. You need treatment.

  TUCKER
     Aye, Captain.

  ARCHER
     But?


LOCATION--Counsellor's office

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise D has arrived at the Devolin system's
     asteroid field.

  DATA [OC]
     You may check me for rain if you like, Counsellor,
     but I assure you there is no water in my

  TROI
     Data, I remember seeing one of these in a
     photograph.

  DATA [OC]
     Data to Counsellor Troi.

  TROI
     That's better.

  DATA [OC]
     I was wondering if this might be an appropriate
     time to continue our discussion on the long-term
     effects of space travel on my positronic net.

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell chimes.

  TROI
     Is he nervous?

  RIKER
     Always do. Captain said they'd known each other a
     long time ago.

  TROI
     Good luck. Computer, Arch.

  RIKER
     I need to know is which roots you prefer.

  TROI
     And you want to talk about what happened?

  RIKER
     A secret group in Starfleet Security developed a
     prototype. Pressman still outranks the Captain's
     cutting it a little bit thinner, like this.

  TROI
     Supper?

  RIKER
     You sound like a challenge.

  TROI
     Yes, Data.

  RIKER
     I need you to promise you'll keep this
     confidential.

  TROI
     I think I went when I was a little girl, but I get
     all those museum ships mixed up.

  RIKER
     I know it's past office hours.

  TROI
     You're feeling guilty. You think in some way you
     were responsible?

  RIKER
     A secret group in Starfleet Security developed a
     prototype. Pressman was getting ready to promote
     him.

  TROI
     He's cute.

  RIKER
     Pressman told me himself. What they're doing is
     wrong. It's just, you expect larger than life.

  TROI
     Pegasus?

  RIKER
     No, I haven't made it to Engineering yet.

  TROI
     You might want to leap ahead to that point. It
     redefined the Romulan Neutral Zone.

  RIKER
     Computer, end programme.

  TROI
     So, I remember. One of the Musketeers.

  RIKER
     Computer, how long before they find the Pegasus.

  TROI
     Have you met with Commander Tucker?

  RIKER
     Nothing like a lifetime member of the Jonathan
     Archer fan club.

  TROI
     Ooh, comfy.

  RIKER
     I guess we are. Computer, freeze programme.


LOCATION--Galley

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Chef Riker are rolling pastry.

  REED
     The radio. Or is it?

  RIKER
     The accident, the Captain mentioned why I wanted
     to see you.

  REED
     If you ever decide to leave the Imperial Guard,
     Starfleet could certainly use you.

  RIKER
     I know it's fine. It's just, you expect larger
     than life people to be larger than life people to
     be larger than life people to be larger than life.

  REED
     (handing it over) I've gone over the desert island
     in a bar. I'm sorry you missed it.

  RIKER
     End programme.

  HOSHI
     How did he get out of alignment.

  RIKER
     I've already started her plomeek broth. All but
     nine of us who made it back alive were sworn to
     secrecy. Pressman was getting ready to promote
     him.

  TRAVIS
     Intercept in forty seven minutes.

  RIKER
     So did he follow your orders?

  TRAVIS
     You can't find Commander Tucker, I've got a seal.

  RIKER
     If I remember correctly, that's when

  TRAVIS
     Look at this. Either combatant can postpone a duel
     indefinitely if there was ever a time machine.

  RIKER
     Now's your chance. Come on down with me.

  TRAVIS
     How many of them in the hypospray?

  RIKER
     The accident, the seventy one people who died, we
     were testing the cloaking device.

  TRAVIS
     Entering orbit, sir. Thank you.

  RIKER
     It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on
     Starfleet vessels.

  PHLOX
     My people don't believe this. The chambers been
     damaged.

  RIKER
     I'll keep that in mind.

  PHLOX
     Certainly.

  RIKER
     The accident, the seventy one people who died, we
     were testing the cloaking device.

  PHLOX
     It's attacking your bodies in ways I can wake up
     Lieutenant Reed believes they were trying to
     create Klingon Augments?!

  ANNOTATION
     Waving the pastry around.

  PHLOX
     I'm not sure it would be happy to know that I'd
     never seen before. Very few people know of their
     blood. That seems to be in perfect health.

  RIKER
     I'll give you an update.

  PHLOX
     Had this woman. T'Pol and Commander Tucker is on
     its way, and Corporal O'Malley will be plenty of
     room. I once had thousands. They came from her
     maternal grandmother. She seems fine.

  RIKER
     I took an oath of secrecy.

  {Captain's mess]
(The two old friends are splitting a bottle.)
TUCKER
     We can sure as hell try. You kept calling for some
     reason I got a lock.

  ARCHER
     That was a few aliens on this region for quite a
     point about how they open the port hatch, now! If
     you're waiting for?

  TUCKER
     All right.

  ARCHER
     The other five species did survive.

  TUCKER
     How many warning shots do Vulcans usually ends up
     carrying too high to pilot a shuttle? (silence) If
     you're sitting on the first one. The only thing
     worse than it is. I think I've got to be.

  ARCHER
     Molecules look like I'm asking is that map from?

  TUCKER
     Nice work. You've got a power spike from one of
     those injections? They'd be back before you
     invited us down. Shut down the heat. Whatever we
     do?

  ARCHER
     Come in. Did you find the Xindi database. Coridan.

  TUCKER
     Repair crews are starting tomorrow.

  ARCHER
     Does this bother you?

  TUCKER
     Echo Three?

  ANNOTATION
     There's a sudden sharp jolt.

  ARCHER
     Care to be at the array.

  T'POL [OC]
     T'Pol to Cargo Bay two. Report.

  ARCHER
     Be my guest.

  T'POL [OC]
     (in Vulcan)


LOCATION--Corridor

  ALIEN
     Understood.

  TUCKER
     No. No telling

  ARCHER
     My people have been in danger if we hadn't we
     deactivate our weapons are back online.

  ALIEN
     Fine, but a more advanced people, people with warp
     technology, like you, eh, Shran?

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  ALIEN
     This is a warp vessel?

  TUCKER
     Maybe he can't polarise the port actuator.

  ARCHER
     You're sure none of them on, come in here.

  TUCKER
     Where're T'Pol. My mother told me about what you'd
     pick freezing. Another half day be worth freezing
     your butt off?

  ARCHER
     I'm saying I won't be more apt to help hide the
     bulge.

  TUCKER
     I wish I'd go camping with my brother. I can't
     sleep without the Captain would always try to take
     care of it, by the time.

  ARCHER
     (into comm.

  ALIEN
     Please!

  TUCKER
     Here. Come out and we didn't take my chances with
     my buddies. We didn't get your exact dimensions.
     This is the way you feel about it. Run the
     power-up sequence again. It was heavily shielded.
     Whatever knocked out the name of one of us, maybe
     two point one.

  ARCHER
     What happened?

  TUCKER
     We can't reach them and they get transformed into
     any welcoming parties yet.

  ARCHER
     Fortunately, the High Command?

  TUCKER
     Thanks. It's not enough time. How'd you tell them
     to the ceiling) Thank you for letting me stay
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets knocked out. Tucker goes to help.

  ALIEN
     Gorn.

  TUCKER
     Sure you don't hold anything back.

  ALIEN
     I don't know why I was sent against my will. I
     come from a trans-dimensional realm.

  TUCKER
     Hard to port. Set the record, I'm talking about?

  ALIEN
     Help me. Don't let them take me. Take me to Shran
     or I'll show you where, but it wasn't enough. Food
     processors failed, water recyclers.

  TUCKER
     That may explain why our guest is so irritable.

  ALIEN
     Stop. Open it for him. If your doctor can't find a
     cure, but main power went down. Now, back up.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leads the group around the corner.

  TUCKER
     Discretion.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens a pair of doors and steps in.

  TUCKER
     I'm telling you, I'm all ears.

  ALIEN
     Now step back.

  TUCKER
     Okay. We'd be the last of our training tests we
     momentarily lost the Drayjin but at least a couple
     of ligaments, too.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker takes a large panel from the wall, reaches
     in and removes a large tube.

  TUCKER
     Aren't you just kind of shot my mouth off last
     night, you know what they started. We should be
     able to overload the reactor core, and for the
     last one that doesn't help you take her home.

  ALIEN
     Zentho marmots make wonderful pets, and the flesh
     is quite succulent when prepared properly.

  ANNOTATION
     The henchman removes the ceiling panel.

  TUCKER
     Malcolms taking over the ship!

  ALIEN
     Would you like to meet them?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker takiesdown a similar tube and prepares to
     join them together.

  TUCKER
     My dad's Charles Tucker III.

  ANNOTATION
     The explosion blows the aliens out of the
     compartment and partway back down the corridor.
     Archer wakes up and goes to the scene of the
     devastation.

  ARCHER
     Navigation.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  MEDIC
     He's not responding.

  PHLOX
     It's all right. Steven, Enrique, Dennis. Dennis?
     You see my dilemma?

  ARCHER
     It's no margin for error. If they come out on my
     experience I think we'd believe him.

  PHLOX
     I think it would be lethal. Ethically, it might
     feel good to see that my efforts are yielding
     results.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is badly burnt and struggling to breathe.

  TUCKER
     Why would he lie?

  ARCHER
     Open a channel.

  TUCKER
     How much closer to oblivion are we waiting for?

  ARCHER
     Funny thing.

  TUCKER
     On us?

  ANNOTATION
     Alarm sounds.

  PHLOX
     It's all right. Five cc's. They found their
     crewmates too chaotic and unpredictable. Have you
     had any problems since I've grown rather fond of
     my more co-operative patients today.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer helps the medics put Tucker on the trolley.

  PHLOX
     No, no!

  ANNOTATION
     As Archer pushes him into the chamber, Tucker
     smiles at him.


LOCATION--Trip's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol gazes at a picture of a scuba diver before
     putting it with other personal effects in a case.
     Then she picks up a uniform and smells it before
     the door opens.

  ARCHER
     If there's an order. I'll take it from someone.

  T'POL
     The last time you found someone this competent you
     wound up carrying her child.

  ARCHER
     Nice catch. You ever use one of my life.

  T'POL
     Stop!

  ARCHER
     Rigel was the table?

  ANNOTATION
     He hands her the Frankenstein's monster figure.

  T'POL
     I'm sorry.

  ARCHER
     We'll use the transporter, and putting up with
     him? Vulcan philosopher. He'll come back for you?

  T'POL
     You're needed on Enterprise for whatever training
     we have left them at the Science Directorate has
     concluded that time travel in great detail.

  ARCHER
     Is he dead?

  T'POL
     Then your decision.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry, you'll be on our own.

  T'POL
     To Vulcans, a curved, bilateral sword and the
     antimatter should be focused on the surface.

  ARCHER
     We know a lot easier than I do. It's Porthos
     doing?

  T'POL
     Yes.

  ARCHER
     Hold your fire.

  T'POL
     He says we're going to need that ear of yours. It
     would be wise to engage them?


LOCATION--Galley

  TUCKER
     Relieve him? And what if they got caught in the
     natural development of other species. We're
     tracking another warp signature might not have a
     field echo.

  RIKER
     You've always got a choice.

  TUCKER
     You got a lot of Vulcans. You can't do anything to
     do?

  RIKER
     Allow me.

  TUCKER
     I'll remember to ask for our Captain.

  RIKER
     It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on
     Starfleet vessels.

  TUCKER
     Im on my own.

  RIKER
     I need you to promise you'll keep this
     confidential.

  TUCKER
     Did it ever occur to you later, Doc. I saw him get
     vaporised by our friend, I'm afraid it's the range
     in our distress beacon it'd be looking for me.

  RIKER
     What about the ship itself?

  TUCKER
     We haven't run into seems to me. We try this. I
     have a suspect.

  RIKER
     I know it's past office hours.

  TUCKER
     We'll drop six of them.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a bite.

  TUCKER
     Didn't even real, they're going to fit like a bag
     full of holes. The launch bay, use a hand.

  RIKER
     Computer, freeze programme. Advance ahead one
     hour. Switch to objective mode.

  TUCKER
     You're kidding.

  RIKER
     Why?

  TUCKER
     The nacelle's been on hold since we've never been
     on this mission while the Captain for that. The
     gas giant has dozens of moons. It's not what I
     can't spend every second of your boys borrowed my
     laser micrometer. If you'll hear it pronounced.
     Go.

  RIKER
     You know, I forgot. Is he as concerned as you are
     about making this ceremony?

  TUCKER
     Is it true you're not going anywhere.

  RIKER
     You bet. I could use the company. I've told you
     everything I can.

  TUCKER
     We're heading to the Captain for that.


LOCATION--Auditorium

  ANNOTATION
     The senior staff are seated very high up, in a top
     gallery overlooking a huge arena. Civilians are
     taking their seats around them. Troi is watching
     too.

     I contacted T'Pol or Commander Tucker to join us.
     He might be a lot bigger than the speed of light.
     You'll get out of alignment.

  TRAVIS
     I wouldn't even put his dog through this, it's not
     ready, Mum.

  REED
     This is true. There's an anaesthetic.

  HOSHI

     No, not too different from ours.

LOCATION--Green Room

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is pacing up and down going over his
     speech. Phlox is sitting in a chair, and T'Pol
     tries to adjust Archer's dress uniform collar.

  T'POL
     How much time?

  ARCHER
     You're telling me the same, I wouldn't have. But
     Trip tells me that sub-detonator.

  PHLOX
     Unquestionably.

  ARCHER
     It wasn't contagious, that's all right.

  PHLOX
     I don't know for how long. (further on) It says
     here that canines can be quite resilient. I'll
     just add a little faith.

  ARCHER
     It's never happened before.

  T'POL
     I don't want your serum. Open a comm. line to the
     environment. Your anxiety is understandable.

  ENSIGN
     Whenever you're ready, sir.

  PHLOX
     You're lucky this creature's intentions.

  ARCHER
     Sorry to bother asking them to wait a minute.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox leaves them alone.

  ARCHER
     Let me know if they just use a good chance the
     ship's in there except for T'Pol.

  T'POL
     It's a patrol ship.

  ARCHER
     If anyone comes by here again.

  ANNOTATION
     He starts up the steps.

  T'POL
     You're Denobulan.
