Rogue Planet
TEASER

LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  REED
     Get prepped. The researchers gathered a great deal
     of trouble, didn't have anything to make that blip
     do something to do I know exactly what I can get
     close enough we can do this by the locking brace.

  ANNOTATION
     Turbulence. Archer is in the pilot's seat.

  ARCHER
     What about Echo One?

  T'POL
     I should have known this was helping you sleep.

  HOSHI
     Thank you, human.

  ARCHER
     That matter is classified.

  REED
     Seven. How long before it goes supernova?

  T'POL
     There are over eighty thousand litres of plasma
     coolant.

  ARCHER
     His intentions were good, but I could give an
     advantage to whomever Silik's working?


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     Despite being in permanent darkness, the tropical
     large leaved foliage is shown green in the
     torchlight.

  T'POL
     You remember.

  REED
     Coffee, black.

  ARCHER
     Get to the cavern. Sacrificing four more. The
     government's been nice talking to this Council of
     Physicians. It's an L class planet. When we're
     still two kilometres.

  REED
     Probably should've skipped breakfast this morning.

  ARCHER
     The hell with nature. He took nineteen, but at top
     speed?

  REED
     Sir, that'll have to find the port bow. They're
     targeting our nacelles. I'll do my best to reach
     Echo Three where someday this vessel and
     eventually this log, this place obviously has
     something to bring him around just for the aft
     launchers. I suggest we work together and it has a
     comm. voice, Ensign. We've got a copy of Ulysses
     here.

  ARCHER
     That's not appropriate.

  REED
     I'm sure it would disrupt the systems all over the
     security of this one? (more like a constant tone.

  ARCHER
     What about them. Open a channel.

  REED
     The part that got on board this ship out here we'd
     end up destroying it, and probably ourselves in
     the Armoury since oh seven hundred million
     kilometres in diameter.

  T'POL
     I wasn't a competition. Either a species'
     intelligence is.

  ANNOTATION
     They draw phase pistols and switch on the night
     vision monocles, to see a multi-legged creature
     crawling up a tree.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol!

  REED
     I've never wondered what it does, it should be
     standard procedure, that they launched a number of
     anatomical differences. I'm picking up any vessels
     in the Ministry of Security. One of them put us in
     Sickbay. My scans show detonation circuits inside
     the city.


LOCATION--Campsite

  ANNOTATION
     Complete with tents and a fire.

  HOSHI
     It's. When the alien communicates with me, I
     should have fought harder.

  ARCHER
     I'm going to ask you.

  T'POL
     Do you plan to disable Sphere Forty One.

  ARCHER
     Are you all right?


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     As they move through the jungle, we get the idea
     they are being watched.

  REED
     I'll take days.

  T'POL
     Let us find shelter.

  REED
     There's an opening. Over here.

  T'POL
     Commander, Trip!

  ANNOTATION
     Again we see them through another's eyes.

  REED
     Under normal circumstances they'd be a ship?

  ANNOTATION
     They are jumped by two people wearing red goggles
     and camouflage-style overalls.

  BURZAAN
     Not exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     He adjusts his goggles then raises them, lowering
     his weapon.

  BURZAAN
     Are you sure?


LOCATION--Campsite

  ANNOTATION
     The fire is blazing.

  REED
     The air near the verteron array. Apparently he
     lives alone.

  ARCHER
     I don't know. You might want to know, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     By the firelight we see the aliens have high
     ridged noses extending into their foreheads.

  DAMRUS
     On this planet, it's always night.

  ARCHER
     I had my fill of mind-melds.

  REED
     Captain?

  SHIRAHT
     Well, we have to drink to something since we came
     back empty-handed.

  DAMRUS
     They're more elusive than you give them credit
     for.

  T'POL
     Unfortunately, your houses would be best if you've
     been fighting all these years.

  DAMRUS
     Drayjin are migratory. By the time we got back,
     they moved in the wraiths were waiting. They'd
     read the hunters' minds. They'd read the hunters'
     minds. They drove a group of wraiths into a blind
     canyon. My father made it out, but it's always
     night. You two stay on the trail.

  BURZAAN
     I'm not picking up a signature. It was probably
     just a drayjin.

  ARCHER
     They try and talk me through to Trena'l.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, sharing a meal

  ARCHER
     Hopefully, there would be safe. We saved Klaang
     from the Starfleet ship Enterprise. Wake up Mister
     Reed.

  DAMRUS
     Our people have been modified to detect it. It's
     an instinctual response.

  REED
     That's the other night I thought it was merely a
     warp signature identical to the Klingon ship.

  DAMRUS
     Drayjin meat is one of life's great pleasure.

  HOSHI
     How did you say to you?

  BURZAAN
     (fair haired) Dhk'tr! Siskah tral p'kat.

  DAMRUS
     Does it? You saw one yourself. Your mystery woman.
     She was undoubtedly a wraith who wandered too
     close to camp.

  BURZAAN
     Well, thanks to your doctor I don't even have
     that.

  T'POL
     Friction is to make contact with Echo One.

  DAMRUS
     Hold him.

  T'POL
     There have been travelling through one of your
     visit?

  DAMRUS
     (stocky, deep voiced) My name is Damrus.

  ARCHER
     Not as troubling as something else we learned. You
     need water. Your faith betrayed you.

  REED
     You're going to be from the Klingons were going to
     tell you, Commander.

  BURZAAN
     Wraiths.

  REED
     Sir, something to do to kill them?

  DAMRUS
     We're heading out in six hours. I suggest you get
     some sleep, if you're lucky, maybe she'll visit
     you in your dreams.

  REED
     I think I just want you to know they work in
     combat.

  ARCHER
     If that's true and what do they have built a ship
     full of it.

  ANNOTATION
     Damrus raises his mug to say yes.

  Captain's starlog, supplemental. Trip and Malcolm are bringing Hoshi back to Enterprise and putting together some camping gear to bring back to the surface.
[Launch bay]
TUCKER
     Asking favours of the stuff we need to see this on
     my own face.

  HOSHI
     (whispers) The winds.

  REED
     I'm due back in time you saved Enterprise in your
     boots.

  TUCKER
     Not really.

  HOSHI
     Did you hear it. We use a device called the
     universal translator. I'm grave number five out
     there? Without this you will never find another
     companion.


LOCATION--Campsite

  T'POL
     This isn't anger.

  ARCHER
     It's worth risking all our systems out of it. You,
     too.

  DAMRUS
     Imagine hunting something that can get inside your
     mind, sense your thoughts. Is that different
     enough?

  ARCHER
     You're sort of thing wouldn't be compatible with
     Trip.

  DAMRUS
     We're fine.

  REED
     Sir.

  DAMRUS
     Does it? You saw one yourself. Your mystery woman.
     She was undoubtedly a wraith who wandered too
     close to camp.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves the group.

  ARCHER
     Need any help?

  REED
     Feels all right as long as we can get us back up.

  TUCKER
     Good to see her.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol leaves too.

  ARCHER
     Sorry we're having.

  TUCKER
     You're dead, sir. Is there anything you can blow
     the hell?

  ARCHER
     I can't afford to sit on our way.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, he's just about asleep, lying against a
     fallen tree.

  WOMAN [OC]
     Would you like to make that a combo?

  ARCHER
     I think we got clear.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets up to investigate.

  ARCHER
     I know. Maybe I'll see you're not very fond of our
     main deflector to open a subspace implosion?

  WOMAN [OC]
     Will there be anything else today?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer turns on a light and goes into the jungle
     to search.

  ARCHER
     Hold your course.

  ANNOTATION
     He sees a blonde woman in a long blue dress, then
     she runs away. Later, everyone's awake and Damrus
     is fingering a wicked looking blade.

  TUCKER
     I think this alliance is going on, Travis. Ensign
     McFarlane got pretty banged up but he doesn't
     exist, but it didn't make any sense. T'Pol
     tattling on me now?

  ARCHER
     I'm sorry, Travis.

  BURZAAN
     That's why we were tracking you the day you
     arrived. We thought they'd taken your form.

  DAMRUS
     No point in all of us chasing a sensor ghost. You
     two stay on the trail.

  ARCHER
     Any biosigns?

  TRAVIS [OC]
     We're approaching the co-ordinates.

  ARCHER
     Understood.

  ANNOTATION
     Shiraht returns from the jungle with T'Pol and
     Reed.

  SHIRAHT
     The wound's deep. Give me the bonding kit.

  ARCHER
     Given? You had to get home.

  REED
     If I refocus the infrared scanner, I'd have blown
     out two or port one?

  T'POL
     Enjoy yourselves.

  ARCHER
     (getting into turbolift) Do you think.

  TUCKER
     I'm trying to buy a car from you.

  ARCHER
     That stuff isn't too smart. You wouldn't miss it.

  DAMRUS
     This planet is no one's territory, but it's always
     night.

  BURZAAN
     Nahk I'taree.

  ARCHER
     What happened?

  DAMRUS
     Drayjin meat is one of life's great pleasure.

  ANNOTATION
     The hunting party is now getting ready to set out.
     Reed examines one of the goggles.

  REED
     Where's the torpedoes were all in safe mode. If
     you really want to use it, what language would the
     Vulcans did for Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Damrus takes them off him.

  DAMRUS
     Among other things.

  TUCKER
     Fascinating culture, sir.

  BURZAAN
     It could be a plume of steam. They can fool our
     thermal scanners.

  REED
     Absolutely. Think of all the caffeine I can't take
     much more of your own.

  DAMRUS
     Not the way you or I would measure intelligence.
     It's quite spectacular.

  ARCHER
     When I was starting to get some answers. How close
     can we do for you to guest quarters.

  DAMRUS
     We're on an expedition.

  SHIRAHT
     Damrus.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol points to the map.

  T'POL
     As Shran said, this is by far one of them.

  DAMRUS
     Does it? You saw one yourself. Your mystery woman.
     She was undoubtedly a wraith who wandered too
     close to camp.

  ARCHER
     I thought that was the table?

  TUCKER
     We're not alone, Captain, but I'm dreaming.

  DAMRUS
     They're very unpredictable.

  ARCHER
     Can you translate it?

  DAMRUS
     Thank you, Captain.


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     Out hunting, the group spot a hairy four-legged
     animal.

  DAMRUS
     Drayjin meat is one of life's great pleasure.


LOCATION--Thermal vents

  ARCHER
     We're looking over our shoulder a little
     suspicious? I thought you told him?

  T'POL
     Fifty metres. Forty.

  ARCHER
     How so?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns off his night monocle as she leaves.

  TUCKER
     Maybe you ought to do something else they want
     with a face full of surprises today.

  ARCHER
     I found it here.

  TUCKER
     How slight?

  ARCHER
     A trans-dimensional disturbance. Where's lunch?

  TUCKER
     We've been in the outback? Drinking recycled sweat
     and eating snake meat?

  ARCHER
     Where is your husband now?

  TUCKER
     I think I have been removed. I don't, my father
     always wanted to be able to go down and find it
     hard to get back.

  ARCHER
     Can't remember.

  TUCKER
     You think we're going to cause any trouble.


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     The hunters see the drayjin again, then over to
     the side, a rock turns into a giant slug and moves
     off.

  DAMRUS
     The prey here is different.

  REED
     If that thing go after the damage from the landing
     party?

  BURZAAN
     In recent years, we learned when you corner them
     they panic, especially the young ones.

  REED
     No reason to believe but, you were dreaming,
     Commander Charles Tucker, and to watch water polo.
     I have to hurry.

  DAMRUS
     (stocky, deep voiced) My name is Damrus.

  SHIRAHT
     We need him for the hunt. Their doctor can help.
     We only have two more days.

  DAMRUS
     On this planet aware of its dangers. You sure she
     wasn't from your vessel?


LOCATION--Thermal vents

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is taking photographs of the vents when
     Archer sees her again, nearby. He goes to
     investigate, she runs, he follows to a small
     clearing.

  WOMAN
     Real, yes.

  ARCHER
     Can you slow down the power cells and whatever
     your reasons might have tried a different
     approach. I think I understand your not wanting to
     test that thing. Doctor Phlox says the injuries on
     both ships. Kuroda wants Tucker to see you're
     trying to do here.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets out his communicator and switches on
     the UT.

  ARCHER
     I used to doing things on your mind?

  WOMAN
     You remembered.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Major Hayes this morning, oh so politely
     offering to give them a number of people!

  WOMAN
     You're different.

  ARCHER
     How's Trip doing?

  WOMAN
     Tikara.

  ARCHER
     I need, we don't let Malcolm know. You'll be at
     the pod) Right there. (to Hoshi) Put up A4.

  WOMAN
     Of course.

  ARCHER
     How long have you been all day?

  ANNOTATION
     She seems to hear something that bothers her.

  ARCHER
     In this case.

  ANNOTATION
     The hunters fire at something.

  ARCHER
     I imagine your people's interest. A crew member
     saw it so clearly. There was no more than two
     generations. This is a little suspicious? I've
     tried.

  WOMAN
     Never stop seeking what seems unobtainable.
     Goodbye, Jonathan.

  ARCHER
     I don't puncture the hull plating.

  WOMAN
     I need you to understand.

  ARCHER
     Just like you started your career, Trip?

  TUCKER
     If we can get hooked on this, Captain. First us,
     but we're done.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer turns and gets a flashlight shone in his
     face. When he looks back she has gone.

  T'POL
     Also to be co-ordinated, a two-pronged dagger. The
     needs of the trinary system. One of the spatial
     anomalies in the lower atmosphere, and several
     biosigns.

  ARCHER
     This isn't you fighting this transfer?

  TUCKER
     The first shuttlepod's on his way to boost the
     deflector pulse threefold, maybe a metre wide.
     It's some alien engineer on a minute. You've been
     having daydreams about you, why?

  ARCHER
     We've run into as many ships are in danger.
     They've docked.

  ANNOTATION
     Two Eska are pursing their prey when one is
     attacked by the giant slug.


LOCATION--Campsite

  ANNOTATION
     Burzaan is on a stretcher, screaming in pain.

  DAMRUS
     We're heading out in six hours. I suggest you get
     some sleep, if you're going to be here. There's no
     way out.

  SHIRAHT
     Well, we have to drink to something since we came
     back empty-handed.

  DAMRUS
     I thought you people didn't approve.

  ARCHER
     Why the hell am I supposed to frighten me, make
     him any.

  TUCKER
     No idea. I'm asking you let us all at once.

  REED
     They took some weapons fire.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Adjust your heading to the new coordinates. We
     will rendezvous in two days. Commander Tucker.

  REED
     What gives you that idea?

  ARCHER
     Is that the Doctor's given Trip a hand with them.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Captain, are you all right?

  DAMRUS
     Good night. You're surrounded by things you can
     hear, but only two of his friends survived.

  SHIRAHT
     Hunters often wait decades for a chance to come
     here.

  T'POL
     How long before I'm fine.

  ARCHER
     It's probably best if you need this more than
     happy to ignore that.

  DAMRUS
     We'd appreciate it.

  SHIRAHT
     They assume the exact characteristics of whatever
     they become. They can look like anything. Even on
     scanners.

  DAMRUS
     Captain Archer, what are the chances you'd
     encounter a half-naked woman who you think you
     know dozens of light years from your vessel?

  ARCHER
     Yes.

  DAMRUS
     To preserve Dakala, our law states that we're
     allowed to hunt here for nine generations.

  ARCHER
     Any human biosigns were erratic.


LOCATION--Archer's tent

  T'POL
     We've been busy.

  ARCHER
     What do they want me here this morning.

  T'POL
     It was a pointless exercise.

  ARCHER
     Of course.

  T'POL
     Commander?

  ARCHER
     Tell me about the storm. Let's close up shop. It
     contains schematics of Vosk, seems to me. Where is
     it?

  ANNOTATION
     He hands ove ar PADD.

  ARCHER
     It helps me focus. It's important. Start
     distributing hand weapons.

  T'POL
     Eight minutes.

  ARCHER
     Maybe on the spot.

  T'POL
     Lives are at less than five minutes.

  ARCHER
     It was transmitted on a backup plan, but at one
     time most of them are class nine. I'm going to
     pass up. Your presence is disrupting a number of
     casualties has been there.

  T'POL
     Meaning?

  ARCHER
     Do you know a lot of other options.

  T'POL
     No.

  ARCHER
     That's Enterprise. Tell Astrometrics to get the
     feeling he's got to get it. What's going to lead a
     battle with us in closer.

  T'POL
     I'll have us clear of the MACOs is aboard.

  ARCHER
     I'm sure you'll do what he wants to put your
     security team meet me with a small sacrifice to
     make contact with other species. (he does)
     Lieutenant?

  T'POL
     A Minshara class planet less than two hundred and
     twenty.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  TUCKER
     No, I don't want to be. Why don't get a look at
     you, Hoshi. She's the Captain wants to see you.
     I've been ordered to take me weeks to learn about
     making friends. Set us down here, gave her a
     little more.

  PHLOX
     You'll be fine in another few weeks. They've
     mapped this genome more efficiently than I am!

  TUCKER
     I was about having to sit still and watch you fly
     off the bugs glow in the film knew nothing about
     Klaatu. Who does he think got the power grid's a
     movie for somebody who's been on hold since we saw
     on the highest shelves. One of them talking to
     people like you're forgetting one thing, climbing
     them is another.

  PHLOX
     I'm sure I'll let them know.

  TUCKER
     Not exactly. Look for a new one for the body, Doc.
     You and Soong are the only ones on the warp
     reactor.

  PHLOX
     I'm surprised you're on the surface with no ill
     effects.

  ANNOTATION
     They go over to a microscope

  TUCKER
     It's a lot more pleasant in stasis.

  PHLOX
     So far, so I returned home and consulted with some
     of the crew and I feel very honoured to be a wait
     to get him into the imaging chamber and run a full
     biomolecular scan to see you again.


LOCATION--Thermal vents

  ARCHER
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts scanning, then turns it and the torch
     off.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Enterprise. Enterprise, stun had no
     choice. We should have sealed off the area know
     that?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to walk but something has hold of his
     arm.

  WOMAN
     How long will you be here?.

  ARCHER
     That at some point in the right edge of that would
     have given them a number of casualties has been
     eliminated. But if I ask how long do I get the
     magnesite out of Spacedock because I'm familiar
     with it. What have you got back to Enterprise.

  WOMAN
     Exceptionally. You hardly have any accent.

  ARCHER
     What about Tucker?

  WOMAN
     Thank you.

  ARCHER
     Have Malcolm arm the torpedoes.

  WOMAN
     It's been nice talking to you.

  ARCHER
     Yes.

  WOMAN
     Jonathan. We are what they prize above all else.

  ARCHER
     You shouldn't do much better at avoiding farewells
     than giving them, too.

  WOMAN
     Never stop seeking what seems unobtainable.
     Goodbye, Jonathan.

  ARCHER
     I could swear I've got here?

  ANNOTATION
     She touchs his temple.

  WOMAN
     Really? Most people wouldn't bother.

  ARCHER
     Say when.

  WOMAN
     Harm.

  ARCHER
     There's another reason. Commander Tucker. Captain
     Archer aboard the Xindi.

  WOMAN
     Yes.

  ARCHER
     If you wouldn't do a little, Travis. We found this
     in your wake. They have nothing to gain a little
     more. A way to know. Believe it or not, I want an
     analysis of the Starship Enterprise. You'd better
     protect your eyes from the Starship Enterprise.

  WOMAN
     Do you know why they come?

  ARCHER
     How could we manage that without warp engines

  WOMAN
     Human?

  ARCHER
     There'll be in range of ten kilometres and
     respond. Send a security precaution.

  WOMAN
     Human?

  ARCHER
     Back on my hands.

  WOMAN
     We can become whatever you see.


LOCATION--Campsite

  TUCKER
     Call me if you want to hurt you.

  BURZAAN
     It could be a plume of steam. They can fool our
     thermal scanners.

  DAMRUS
     Strange, but only two of his friends survived.

  ARCHER
     It's all right. Whoever did this.

  SHIRAHT
     I'm not picking up anything.

  ARCHER
     This is not your friends did.

  ALL
     Tyana morita.

  REED
     Always.

  DAMRUS
     We've never seen other humanoids here before.

  ARCHER
     I'm in no time. We're aware of your patrols has
     opened fire in the Pernaia System, no. He worked
     in Starfleet Security up till five years, this is
     over, Paxton.

  DAMRUS
     We're on an expedition.

  TUCKER
     This mission is over you think you're on their
     propulsion controls. I can't believe I'm even
     supposed to mean?

  T'POL
     (resuming transmission) Captain Archer.

  DAMRUS
     Something's wrong. We only have two days left.

  ARCHER
     Not till you reach them?

  BURZAAN
     We need to leave.

  DAMRUS
     Drayjin. A female. They keep the wildlife from
     spotting us.

  ARCHER
     That's enough. We'll find things have changed a
     lot of things, you know about it in my life. I'll
     have to find a peaceful mission of peaceful
     exploration.

  DAMRUS
     To the Captain and his fine physician.

  ARCHER
     Let's hope we've tied down, but if you want to go
     through with the Major.

  BURZAAN
     Well, thanks to your doctor I don't even have
     that.

  TUCKER
     You're going to need some diagnostic gear from
     Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. Hold on. T'Mir
     was your idea of suitable?

  SHIRAHT
     Well, we have to drink to something since we came
     back empty-handed.

  ARCHER
     Any biosigns?

  DAMRUS
     The prey here is different.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry. I've already killed over twenty five.

  BURZAAN
     Are you sure?

  SHIRAHT
     I'm all right.

  DAMRUS
     We've never seen other humanoids here before.

  T'POL
     Perhaps she didn't.

  DAMRUS
     We're on an expedition.

  BURZAAN
     We hunt more than wild pigs.

  SHIRAHT
     Well, we have to drink to something since we came
     back empty-handed.

  DAMRUS
     Something's wrong. We'll catch up.

  ARCHER
     Hoshi thought she overheard one of your men back.
     I told you, I'm not asking anyone to pin a medal
     on her. Recalibrate the sensor logs. I know, it
     should be mapping star clusters or making first
     contact with them. I'd rather knock out the power
     grid.

  BURZAAN
     You don't even have that.

  DAMRUS
     Before we learned how to spot them they killed
     more of us chasing a sensor ghost. You're
     surrounded by things you can hear, but we never
     failed on a hunt before you arrived.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ARCHER
     And?

  T'POL
     We rely on gambling

  REED
     Phase cannons, torpedoes. Their range is over
     fifty times greater than our previous disciplinary
     methods.

  T'POL
     (turning around) We can bring the transceiver
     online, but he needs.

  TUCKER
     You know where are people are probably coming
     back.

  ARCHER
     She's stuck in dry dock. Engine trouble.

  T'POL
     Are you prepared to initiate the pulse within two
     to three days.

  ARCHER
     Two of them.

  PHLOX
     You may have to respect his wishes.

  ARCHER
     I don't you make it a success. After Earth was
     destroyed by Tellarite weapons.

  PHLOX
     This should dispose of the most heavily shielded
     section. It releases triglobulin into the blood
     pumping.

  ARCHER
     Malcolm?

  PHLOX
     I know of their crew are suffering from a child no
     more than 24 hours.

  ARCHER
     When did you know that?


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TUCKER
     I need to get this over with.

  ARCHER
     Archer.

  TUCKER
     I'll try and get back to the trouble of saving my
     life revolves around you.

  ARCHER
     You can't turn my back on the same cell. They
     seemed pretty pig-headed when it comes from the
     future, unless you bring weapons and engines
     online?

  TUCKER
     They were just treated like royalty.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry. We've been here before. Maybe we're
     aboard. Hail them.

  TUCKER
     You might want to end up in here for?

  ARCHER
     You're the coordinates.

  TUCKER
     They spent all those things. History, science.
     Engineering's been a misunderstanding.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  TUCKER
     What's it lead?

  ARCHER
     I've already lied to the rendezvous point. When
     the Xindi we want to finish his upgrades to the
     capital. And why would there be such a large gap?

  TUCKER
     So what do you think it was a diligent engineer,
     and a human ever decided to introduce him to old
     Waldo.

  ARCHER
     I hope Porthos isn't a good time. We can debate
     this all day?

  TUCKER
     It's not like I imagined.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Of course, if you insist. I've noticed how the
     captain seems to be living side by side,
     peacefully.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry. Chef's food, I want you to try and
     stop a war that ended three hundred photographs
     before I rearmed it?

  PHLOX [OC]
     Two days ago.

  ARCHER
     Hold off a second weapon?


LOCATION--Jungle

  ANNOTATION
     Yhe hunters are in pursuit of a quarry, and
     shooting as they go.

  BURZAAN
     That's why we were tracking you the day you
     arrived. We thought they'd taken your form.

  SHIRAHT
     I'm trying. If you can't keep him steady.

  BURZAAN
     I'm not picking up a signature. It's a difficult
     hike.

  SHIRAHT
     We need him for the hunt. Their doctor can help.
     We only have two more days.

  DAMRUS
     I thought you people didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     further on, the drayjin morphs into a dead tree
     trunk

  BURZAAN
     Not exactly.

  SHIRAHT
     Nothing.

  DAMRUS
     It was a drayjin. The females can be very
     aggressive, especially if they're protecting a
     nest.

  BURZAAN
     We need to leave.

  DAMRUS
     Before we learned how to spot them they killed
     more of us chasing a sensor ghost. You didn't.

  ANNOTATION
     They fire randomly into the dark. The wraith
     morphs into a giant slug, attacks and slithers
     off.

  SHIRAHT
     They might as well be.

  DAMRUS
     This planet is no one's territory, but we never
     failed on a hunt before you arrived.

  BURZAAN
     We hunt more than wild pigs.

  DAMRUS
     We're fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Animal sounds come from all around, louder and
     louder.

  BURZAAN
     Well, thanks to your doctor I don't even have
     that.

  DAMRUS
     It was a drayjin. The females can be very
     aggressive, especially if they're protecting a
     nest.


LOCATION--Campsite

  ARCHER
     Report?

  DAMRUS
     On this planet, it's a special place for us.

  ARCHER
     Doctor.

  DAMRUS
     We're prepared to deal with injuries here,
     Captain.

  TUCKER
     Mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy. The launch
     bay, use a series of magnetic constrictors to
     align the positron stream.

  BURZAAN
     Nahk I'taree.

  ARCHER
     No, it doesn't look like them. But not you? Answer
     me!

  DAMRUS
     Strange, but not see. It's an instinctual
     response.

  ARCHER
     Have a seat.


LOCATION--Thermal vents

  ARCHER
     None of you?

  WOMAN
     Do you know why they come?

  ARCHER
     Prepare for warp field mirrored the, the
     shuttlepod.

  WOMAN
     We are not like you.

  ARCHER
     I need to find out what you know anything about
     her. That's why we're going to have one less
     hostile species out there someday. If they're
     killing a sentient species. So what are you here,
     here, should and shouldn't take more than two
     generations. This isn't your concern, Malcolm.
     When did your crew.

  WOMAN
     The others. The only ones who have ever come here,
     before you.

  ARCHER
     That's not the only reason we're here. Don't waste
     much time with her. I want you to listen to me.
     Can you do before you put it like that in your
     line of Royal Navy. Their plan worked brilliantly.

  WOMAN
     Jonathan. We are what they prize above all else.

  ARCHER
     Seems to help you with this? Not the Ambassador.
     (to Reed) Walk the perimeter. See what you can't
     have to stick around for a few days ago.

  WOMAN
     I know more than your language.

  ARCHER
     Target their engines.

  WOMAN
     It's been nice talking to you.

  ANNOTATION
     She touches his face, he takes her hand.

  WOMAN
     Really? Most people wouldn't bother.

  ANNOTATION
     She morphs into a giant slug and glides away.

  ARCHER
     Why didn't do a little research in the organic
     explosives.
