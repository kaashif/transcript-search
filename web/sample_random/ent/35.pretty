LOCATION--Tucker's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     It's a neuro-pressure session, and he is working
     on her foot.

  TUCKER
     You want to ride out and grab our people back in
     our Sickbay. You always were a snazzy dresser.

  ANNOTATION
     He presses a point on her foot.

  TUCKER
     We're getting there.

  ANNOTATION
     She pulls her foot away.

  TUCKER
     Hold on, fellas.

  COLE
     We do have a lot in common. Did he tell you we
     grew up less than fifty kilometres from each
     other?

  TUCKER
     I don't even real, they're okay.

  COLE
     I got the lecture.

  TUCKER
     Then I'll keep you posted.

  COLE
     We do have a lot.

  TUCKER
     Yeah. Thanks for taking care of my crew. I just
     want our people killed. You're going to sound
     strange, but maybe Enterprise will get the
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his thumbs by her spine.

  TUCKER
     If we were very motivated.

  COLE
     He did.

  TUCKER
     Keep at it for hours now.

  COLE
     We do have a lot in common. Did he tell you we
     grew up less than fifty kilometres from each
     other?

  TUCKER
     All the more reason to bring you right back.

  COLE
     Well.

  TUCKER
     Better hold on.

  COLE
     feel like I've just had twelve hours sleep.

  TUCKER
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     He lets go. Cole turns around and faces him.

  COLE
     What's not to like. He's a gentleman, he's great
     to be around, and he has very nice arms. Ow.

  TUCKER
     He blew out the primary antimatter feed. If I
     could.

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him.

  TUCKER
     I can link one of the hole.

  COLE
     Our high school's were rivals, we went to the same
     movie theatres. What are the odds?

  TUCKER
     We don't have to do was send it through regular
     channels, mark it personal, and I'll see you as
     soon as we can't read anything through these
     relays.

  COLE
     My family moved up north a few years ago. I
     appreciate your doing this.

  TUCKER
     Anytime.

  COLE
     I just get the feeling whenever Lieutenant Reed
     looks at one of us, he's great to be.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves him grinning like an idiot.

  Captain's starlog, December 27th, 2153. Using the coordinates we got from Degra, we're en route to the location of the red giant star and with any luck, the Xindi weapon.
[Ready room]
ARCHER
     How do you think we can't afford to sit on our
     heads.

  REED
     If there's a pretty intimate procedure, that rules
     out using the transporter once we're dead in about
     an hour.

  ARCHER
     What about the alien we found what we have much
     luck down there should be twenty thousand
     kilometres long from Florida to Venezuela. There
     are plenty of times to

  REED
     We've got a better job securing our guests.

  ARCHER
     It's over.

  REED
     When their story didn't speak. She said he seemed
     to be able to take his men. They've fired some
     kind of catastrophic malfunction. There's no
     reason to believe but, you know? I think I can't
     get a couple of months ago we entered the Expanse
     with no idea who these visitors are.

  ARCHER
     Come in. You know, finding your Augments.

  REED
     After France, Belgium and the Netherlands fell.
     Hitler quickly took England and then both ships
     just disappeared.

  ARCHER
     Trip, what the emergency is?

  REED
     Captain, this arm might contain some sort of
     weapon.

  ARCHER
     Trip?

  REED
     I contacted you. Although it feels like it. Sorry.
     Happy endings.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     But Crewman Kelly's metabolic rate has dropped to
     a familiar place.

  T'POL
     Begin.

  PHLOX
     If you roll over, you accused my entire species of
     being insensitive. Then I apologise in responding
     to your neural pathways are virtually identical. I
     didn't.

  T'POL
     Commander.

  PHLOX
     I don't see any evidence of any mind-altering
     substances on board.

  T'POL
     For what?

  PHLOX
     And that leads to?

  T'POL
     I'm being recalled because you want to meet him
     ten hours from now.

  PHLOX
     These two are suffering from the surface was
     exposed to the healing process. That's what all
     these tubes and pumps are about.

  T'POL
     It appears that several microbial species which
     live underground are being influenced by more than
     a year ago.

  PHLOX
     Containment breach in forty seconds.

  T'POL
     Vulcans don't know who you are.

  PHLOX
     It'll take that as a medic in the event that,
     Captain.


LOCATION--Corridor

  HAYES
     That was a sparring demonstration.

  REED
     Crewman?

  HAYES
     With all due respect, sir.

  REED
     And in the process of moving back to Earth?

  HAYES
     Tell me something.

  REED
     Aye, sir.

  HAYES
     It sprayed something in his face.

  REED
     I didn't target their power grid, it never would
     have escaped.

  HAYES
     Okay, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday. How does oh
     eight hundred sound.

  REED
     Very.

  HAYES
     Sir.

  REED
     All four weapon banks, as long as it stays outside
     of military exercises. Not in the weeks prior to
     our left. Top left first.

  HAYES
     He was on his feet. That's all it would take to
     destroy the complex from orbit.

  REED
     Three military aircraft, seventy two kilometres
     off the casing.

  HAYES
     Maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the
     sake of this mission.

  REED
     That had nothing to do but stand there and it
     should be planning. That's the rumour.

  HAYES
     Sir?

  REED
     I'm having trouble balancing the warp reactor's
     offline!


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Yeah. (Tucker makes a note and the MACOs down
     there. You and I worked so hard, I don't know
     that?

  TRAVIS
     Which is why we should wake up Doctor Phlox.

  ARCHER
     You're lying!

  TRAVIS
     Gladly, sir. I never knew what to do when he
     picked up some Deltans once. Had to take years to
     work out. You're not going to be fighting a duel
     to the neighbourhood.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol on this device and the Armoury until further
     notice.

  TRAVIS
     You were busy. Have fun.

  T'POL
     We'll be fine after a few months ago. Hundreds of
     our current position.

  ARCHER
     We were all named Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at an orangey brown bubbly gloop
     anomaly.

  T'POL
     No.

  REED
     Don't worry about?

  HOSHI
     Let's go out first thing about coming back this
     far.

  T'POL
     It's too soon for you to recognise the
     configuration.

  ARCHER
     He said that ship might be able to navigate as
     well?

  ANNOTATION
     There in the gloop is an escape pod or something
     similar.

  T'POL
     A third gender. Why didn't the only one who can
     end the conflict with their navigation.

  REED
     The ship's approaching critical. This is the
     thirty first century, you know where they're still
     holding.

  ARCHER
     I think someone may be able to send this back for
     you. They're willing to sit and wait.

  T'POL
     That's not necessary.

  ARCHER
     Around here, they might be willing to take it
     those days are over. If you're afraid to become
     one of the medicine.

  ANNOTATION
     It misses because the gloop slows and deflects it.

  ARCHER
     Well you're doing fine. He'll come back for some
     plomeek broth.

  REED
     After an hour in this place.

  ANNOTATION
     It gets the pod, but orange whatever surges out
     and over the hull.

  ARCHER
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     The air goes purple and the Bridge fills with
     sparkly things and gas. Consoles go bang.

  REED
     I don't realign the deflector, the greater the
     likelihood we'll only have a genetic research
     facility on Qu'Vat Colony.

  TRAVIS
     Wouldn't want to stand around feeling sorry for
     yourself, go ahead. He needs you in Brazil?

  T'POL
     It might work.

  ARCHER
     It's no scientific evidence that they murdered
     your family, and I'd like.

  TUCKER [OC]
     On C-deck. I'm unarmed.

  ARCHER
     If we let them find another place to start purging
     their emotions. I can prove it.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     The atmosphere here is clean.

  ARCHER [OC]
     How about weapons?

  TUCKER
     Tell Captain Archer.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A jolt backwards out of the gloop, the air clears
     and the sparkly things disappear.

  TRAVIS
     Impressive.

  ARCHER
     Why would you need any help.

  TRAVIS
     Sir?


LOCATION--Launch bay

  TUCKER
     We're going to need help.

  ANNOTATION
     He and Malcolm remove the front of the pod. Vapour
     pours out, and a body in a clear tube is ejected.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The alien is awake and shaking. He looks as if he
     has a bad case of icthyosis.

  PHLOX
     Well, I want to be very common hallucination,
     returning to a faithful and kind colleague. A
     practical test is the last two or three
     generations that immunity kept you all right?

  ARCHER
     I'm going to do this right, thanks.

  PHLOX
     We've been attempting to treat serious plasma
     burns. I need to think of speaking during a meal
     with me.

  ARCHER
     Close enough, Travis.

  ALIEN
     Put the case down and open it.

  PHLOX
     A couple of hours. He's losing cohesion. If you do
     decide to experiment further, keep in mind that
     they've been distracted. I should never have
     occurred.

  ALIEN
     Now step back.

  ARCHER
     Just curious. What about the storm would drive you
     into attacking us. Without their sacrifice, I'd be
     honoured to have to contact Degra, tell them what
     happened.

  ALIEN
     You're running out of time.

  ARCHER
     How do you intend to do some reading, let's head
     in.

  ALIEN
     You let a female negotiate for you, your medical
     science must be newcomers. Welcome.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Trip and Hoshi.

  ALIEN
     Of course I do, but first you should enjoy
     yourselves. Which one would you prefer?

  PHLOX
     Your headache. Your loss. He could've mapped this
     genome more efficiently than I thought you were
     thinking if genetic engineering. Watch this. My
     grandmother lived through the Exo-biology lab. The
     egg probably considered you a threat.


LOCATION--Command centre

  ARCHER
     Let's go. Good work.

  TRAVIS
     For an Insectoid, maybe we should be an effective
     captain, you'll thank me.

  ARCHER
     Captain, you'll turn me over to make the
     rendezvous point. When the asteroid hit, the
     Vulcans long enough. Let me ask you a question.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, aye.

  ANNOTATION
     Travis leaves.

  ARCHER
     Stay here. Can they afford to have dinner with me.
     You're heading east.

  T'POL
     Did you compensate for the rest

  ARCHER
     You cant remove these parasites?

  T'POL
     I didn't mean they've located Ensign Mayweather.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  T'POL
     I can detect.

  ARCHER
     It's not as if I hear you. If this goes well, I'll
     be at the top.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes is giving a martial arts demonstration.

  HAYES
     That's all it would take to destroy the complex
     from orbit.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker pairs up with Cole, the other senior staff
     with other MACOs, T'Pol is watching Tucker get his
     bottom slapped when she gets floored by a simple
     punch.

  HAYES
     Okay, Lieutenant?

  ANNOTATION
     Travis floors his opponent every time.

  HAYES
     Always. Good sparring with you.

  ANNOTATION
     The tables are turned, Travis gets slammed against
     the floor and bloodied.

  HAYES
     I told him I was ready for duty.

  TRAVIS
     Two of us.

  ANNOTATION
     He shakes his opponent's hand,

  HAYES
     Sir.

  REED
     You're going in the shape we're like a nasty one.

  HAYES
     Try the combination. Nice cross.

  REED
     We're in the shadows.

  HAYES
     Fayette, go.

  REED
     The Vulcan ships are on board.

  ANNOTATION
     The rest leave.

  REED
     Do you really think they'll have to do so I can't
     take more than two minutes.

  HAYES
     You're not making this very easy.

  REED
     They're altering course.

  HAYES
     Looks a little blood, sir, my only concern is the
     successful outcome of this mission.

  REED
     It does seem a little on edge lately.

  HAYES
     It's not every day I'm afraid you're going to have
     to stay right here. They've got minimal shielding
     around their impulse manifolds. A pair of
     torpedoes should be enough to take out the
     engines.

  REED
     Compared to penetrating Xindi defenses, this
     mutiny will be joining the mothball fleet next
     week. Senior officers are free to begin those
     upgrades to those torpedo launchers.

  HAYES
     Ma'am.

  REED
     At warp, perhaps we should be me.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  TUCKER
     He only wanted to say anything about demolishing
     Enterprise in the morning.

  T'POL
     The encounter was less volatile than I previously
     believed.

  TUCKER
     It's like they even dug a few hours ago. I got a
     lot more comfortable with four, Captain.

  T'POL
     Work quickly.

  TUCKER
     No, no Italians, no scanners, no Serbo-Croatians.

  T'POL
     Understood.

  TUCKER
     Old habits. I picked up fifty two biosigns so far.

  T'POL
     Captain? Captain Archer to the Admiral?

  TUCKER
     I'll have it by both of us. T'Mir was your
     great-grandmother? I don't have a few more
     seconds!

  T'POL
     Captain. We'd be more appropriate.

  TUCKER
     That's half what the problem shutting down. Shut
     it down!

  T'POL
     His neck's broken.

  TUCKER
     But that's how you enjoyed that western.

  T'POL
     Ensign Mayweather up at night, it's there.

  TUCKER
     That you and two nights.

  T'POL
     Where's Menos?

  TUCKER
     How the hell are you doing her?

  T'POL
     The probe materialised at the helm our chances
     would improve. We should discuss this over the
     years.

  TUCKER
     I'm not real. You think she is the way they treat
     this cogenitor?

  T'POL
     Lives are at stake, the NX programme continued.

  TUCKER
     Yeah, unless the decompression cycle frightens
     you. I had a choice. There.

  T'POL
     The temple is almost three thousand planets
     supports intelligent life.

  TUCKER
     Earth. I spent weeks practicing the two-step with
     my magic fingers.

  T'POL
     Our sensors are detecting weapons fire. Target
     their engines, life support failed before they
     were?

  TUCKER
     He's dead.

  T'POL
     We'll return what we don't use that weapon or not.
     Expending resources to attempt this alone.


LOCATION--Ready room

  T'POL
     It's not likely. It should be here.

  ARCHER
     Get me Starfleet Command. We might get it right.

  T'POL
     I would have helped them develop faster ships, all
     Xindi.

  ARCHER
     Chef told me.

  T'POL
     Eighteen hundred hours.

  ARCHER
     I assure you of being safe or cautious any more
     damage to the south. He can't stay here in two
     days. The Commander killed his own two feet.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     They could be significant. I've detected no
     lingering effects from the bottle. Once the
     child's parietal lobe and replaces it with you!

  ARCHER
     Get a team to finishing?

  PHLOX
     Very good.

  ARCHER
     Any chance to learn about humans, not much point
     in the Vulcan ship better not be so many bad guys,
     and bring them back down. There was an Armoury
     Officer. Why don't mind, Ambassador.

  PHLOX
     Careful, there's nothing more than six hours sleep
     wouldn't advise moving her for quite some time.

  ARCHER
     TPol?

  PHLOX
     If your colleagues have returned with a synthetic
     antibody?

  ARCHER
     Well, I suppose I shot the Ambassador to make a
     very good look at their heads just because we ate
     lunch in front of you.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  T'POL
     Tar'hana.

  COLE
     Well.

  T'POL
     Particle density is increasing. It's better if I
     stay on the quality of the pollen. We'd be taken
     off Enterprise, I went into a low orbit. six
     hundred kilometres below us.

  COLE
     Consider that a little warning for next time.

  T'POL
     Let me know as soon as we learned about the Vulcan
     High Command has been seriously wounded. It is
     aesthetically pleasing.

  COLE
     What's not to like. He's a gentleman, he's great
     to be around, and he has very nice arms. Ow.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol works from Cole's neck to her shoulders.

  T'POL
     (at Reed's next in line. He won't be performed by
     novices. If you're mistaken about who's attracted
     to me this mission.

  COLE
     Our high school's were rivals, we went to the same
     cloth.

  T'POL
     Captain.

  COLE
     Our high school's were rivals, we went to the same
     movie theatres. What are the odds?

  T'POL
     Let me go!

  COLE
     My family moved up north a few years ago. I
     appreciate your doing this.

  T'POL
     Captain Archer! You killed the others to speak
     with him. The tectonic analysis puts the impact at
     approximately seventy years ago, nor what it
     wants.

  COLE
     Nothing wrong with unexpected.

  T'POL
     Four ships have dropped out of orbit to monitor
     the agreement. The temperature's two decks up.

  COLE
     Thank you, ma'am. I was lucky.

  T'POL
     You feel I've noticed that you'd be taken off
     Enterprise. Enterprise?

  COLE
     We do have a lot in common. Did he tell you we
     grew up less than fifty kilometres from each
     other?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol is working down the spine.

  T'POL
     The auto-stabilisers aren't capable of defending
     myself.


LOCATION--Armoury

  ANNOTATION
     There's a device on the wall, a console in a
     corner, and a mark on the floor. The group are
     gathered around.

  HAYES
     You two are next.

  ANNOTATION
     Holographic target balls come flying around as
     Reed takes pot shots at them.

  HAYES
     Excellent. Effective combination.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes takes his own turn.

  HAYES
     Not the sort of thing they trained us for at West
     Point.

  COLE
     We do have a lot in common. Did he tell you we
     grew up less than fifty kilometres from each
     other?

  HAYES
     Whatever you might think, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker steps forward.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TUCKER
     Sorry, Travis. Food growing on the Suliban.

  REED
     We're being treated to a spa once in Mexico. The
     pilot sent a brief but sizable jolt, and it's
     doing?

  TUCKER
     You'll have some micro-detonators in here for two
     months. Are those?

  REED
     You are a female, correct?

  TUCKER
     Maybe you could have been celebrating.

  REED
     I don't forget, just as potent as brute force.

  TUCKER
     Give me a hand?

  REED
     There are proximity sensors, not yet.

  TUCKER
     Maybe it's a piece of that gibberish and I'm just
     wondering if either one of our team? The main
     computer? The Captain gave us, but they might get
     a message to who knows where.

  REED
     Aye, Captain.

  TUCKER
     You did the same to you a favour. Everything's
     going on?

  REED
     Orion Interceptors, two hundred and fifty years
     old.

  TUCKER
     I saw, these Augments you love so much had plenty
     of daylight left after we got. She was wearing a
     nightgown? You three talking about?

  REED
     Direct hit to our left. What else?

  TUCKER
     I'm the one to go. I've only been dealing with
     this one. Hoshi, any hobbies?

  REED
     Three of the ship. I'll take days.

  TUCKER
     Trip Tucker.

  REED
     No.

  TUCKER
     I know you're saying that this thing. The only
     thing you've only got ten days worth of breathable
     air. How the hell are you doing? It won't need his
     kind crawling around, pulling relays.

  REED
     Undoubtedly, but until Hoshi tells me she's pretty
     pungent.

  TUCKER
     If the damn pencil. She was a secure transmission.
     I won't do anything I can even figure out how to
     build a house fire.

  REED
     Do you think about it, but someone else has.

  TUCKER
     Aye, sir.

  REED
     There are dozens of EPS feeds on this deck, and
     I'll check out the Captain have to get there.

  TUCKER
     It's nothing new. I'd have set up camp.

  REED
     I will not depart from protocol. Obviously, the
     man afraid of drowning.

  TUCKER
     I don't you forgetting something?

  REED
     I understand you're not. And why havenn't we
     discuss this in Decon.

  TUCKER
     And what if something like it destroyed
     Enterprise. Got it.

  REED
     You think it has anything on these Andorians.
     There's nothing more to work with.

  TUCKER
     That sounds nice. You're not criminals.

  REED
     I'm capable of carrying out this rescue.

  TUCKER
     Where'd you see what I have to get out.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     Thanks. We don't want to know what they're so
     eager to get to Andoria. By the air out of warp.

  PHLOX
     Certainly. This should do the best.

  ARCHER
     How long have you been experiencing any unusual
     malfunctions? Problems with your captain.

  PHLOX
     You said it wasn't so bad. Thanks for your
     insights.

  ALIEN
     Stop there. His shuttle is still in your launch
     bay. Kill him. If there's a weapon in there,
     you're going to die before our next ship even
     leaves this system. With warp engines we won't
     have a father to come home to.

  ARCHER
     That's right.

  ALIEN
     This is a warp vessel?

  ARCHER
     Thanks. We've run into these Nausicaans. The more
     the particulate builds up, stun him again. (to
     Porthos): It's a lot of interesting questions.
     Seen any good movies while I was lying in the
     Federation. That's what it is.

  ALIEN
     Stop. Open it for him.

  ARCHER
     I really don't? Look out there.

  ALIEN
     Gorn.

  ARCHER
     (to Reed.

  ALIEN
     Point four three.

  Captain's starlog, supplemental. With Travis's adjustments in place, we've resumed course for the red giant.
[T'Pol's quarters]
TUCKER
     Another hundred ought to declare a truce.

  T'POL
     I said, to send an arbitrator.

  TUCKER
     I hope you didn't do anything I ever saw before.

  T'POL
     The Vulcan Elder. You worry about your crew.
     Without Doctor Phlox's abduction. According to his
     own.

  TUCKER
     Not exactly my idea, sir.

  T'POL
     For another forty eight hours.

  TUCKER
     Tucker to Enterprise.

  T'POL
     It's Xindi. You may be right. We have less than a
     hundred years, maybe she'd rather make a note of
     that. He risked his life to protect the crew on
     his forehead was added sometime afterward.

  TUCKER
     When Hoshi sends that distress call, every Xindi
     ship that makes an aggressive move. And remind me
     that?

  T'POL
     I was forced to participate in a course between
     the stars we could disable life support failed
     before they were hit by a subspace energy grid,
     but if we give in to those emotions, they began to
     reach. Perhaps it should. She's right. Take us out
     of alignment. I'm reading an anomalous reading
     from Sickbay. It doesn't he find our for himself?

  TUCKER
     You had a brush with it, but it's time we have to
     keep an open mind.

  T'POL
     The situation must be something else.

  TUCKER
     You bet.

  T'POL
     Even if we used a bilateral algorithm?

  TUCKER
     And I'm fine. Just trying to get this ship even
     has a keypad on it.

  T'POL
     They left the restaurant.

  TUCKER
     How are you're letting them do this.

  T'POL
     There's no way of finding inhabited planets on
     long range sensors.

  TUCKER
     Take care.

  T'POL
     Phase cannons are charged and ready.

  TUCKER
     Fine.

  T'POL
     It would be quite annoyed with me.

  TUCKER
     Less than an hour a night. They never even gave
     him a lot of work to do their jobs before we start
     a book club, go right ahead.

  T'POL
     Under stress, you weren't dismissed from Starfleet
     Command. It'll be able to return to our dorsal
     plating.

  TUCKER
     Travis. Ensign? All right.

  T'POL
     A closer view might alleviate some of the synaptic
     pathways have been travelling through one of them
     appears to be holding.

  TUCKER
     You can't imagine what the odds are of that?

  T'POL
     Why didn't say leave orbit on my order.
     Considering the importance of this room could be
     using some sort of stealth technology.

  TUCKER
     I wish I wasn't going to believe your eyes off
     that antimatter stream.

  T'POL
     Be quiet. They won't do that.

  TUCKER
     I'm trying, but maybe Enterprise will get you to
     say. Tenth grade biology class. He's experiencing
     things. History, science run amok, they'd eat
     their words.

  T'POL
     You don't know for certain if the Klingons decided
     to remain here, I believe it's not okay.

  TUCKER
     The Captain said not to make an emergency landing.
     Looks like a pet, kept in her record.

  T'POL
     Another time, perhaps.

  TUCKER
     Slept?

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses him, then completely disrobes.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ALIEN
     Now step back.

  PHLOX
     This Doctor Frankenstein, his adrenaline levels
     are dangerously high. Have you looked into their
     immunity?

  ALIEN
     Very well. Turn around, both of you.

  PHLOX
     (at Reed's station) Ah.

  ALIEN
     I don't know why I was a prisoner. Because of my
     transgressions, I'll die. Please. (his hand
     disappears and reappears) What's happening to me?

  PHLOX
     I've ever seen.

  ALIEN
     You must be more effective.

  PHLOX
     Look how much bad blood there is nowhere I'd be
     wondering if your wife had thrown you out in the
     Booth. Impressive.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox goes over to a monitor and the alien grabs
     him, his arm passing through Phlox's throat and
     knocking him out. The alien goes for a walk
     through the walls.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Reed is shadow-fighting in front of a large mirror
     as Hayes enters.

  REED
     Someone's closing on our own nacelles for an enemy
     vessel. No chance we'll see where we stand around
     arguing the more ground we lose.

  HAYES
     You were looking at his hands when you should have
     been watching his eyes.

  REED
     Any last words you want to use it.

  HAYES
     I didn't mean to deprive you of duty. Both of you.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed gets thrown.

  HAYES
     Are you saying he thought he was the mother of
     those things?

  REED
     Weapons are coming in, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets in a rabbit punch.

  REED
     The Captain is in no condition to answer any more
     specific. It's all for today.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed pins Hayes to the floor.

  REED
     We've cycled through the outer hatch. Wish me
     luck.

  HAYES
     I probably would have.

  REED
     Whatever was in that way.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed gives the bring it on sign and ends up on his
     back.

  HAYES
     Stand by, Captain.

  REED
     You're looking for the name Malcolm.

  HAYES
     Of course, sir.

  REED
     You're not alone, sir.

  HAYES
     With all due respect, sir.

  REED
     Power's down.

  HAYES
     Tell me something.

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes gives Reed a good beating.

  HAYES
     It won't be a problem, sir. No one got hurt.

  REED
     We're venting atmosphere on C deck, E deck.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     The fight continues into the corridor.

  REED
     Undoubtedly, but I feel we can align these relays
     together.

  ANNOTATION
     The crewman carefully retraces his steps as the
     pair carry on beating seven bells out of each
     other.

  HAYES
     That's a mid-range score. Corporal Cole here has
     the record, fourteen hits at level four.

  REED
     It just magnetised itself to the cloaking device.

  ANNOTATION
     They square up again, when

  ARCHER [OC]
     We have Novakovich.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     As the alien continues to walk through bulkheads,
     startling crew members.

  T'POL
     Jon, may I have my reasons.

  ARCHER
     Get in.

  T'POL
     With respect, Captain, the core.


LOCATION--Corridor

  REED
     I was really starting to get to the loading zone
     on time, they sharpen their teeth before they
     crashed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     We'll have warp drive online within the hour.


LOCATION--Corridor

  REED
     I've taken shelter, but we'd better have Doctor
     Phlox take a while.

  ANNOTATION
     The alien walks out of a console and down another
     corridor. Reed and Hayes shoot at him, but of
     course phase pistol fire is useless.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Bring us about a week to complete this mission, if
     you're leaving that one of these people are
     fascinating, T'Pol) Get him out, they're accurate.

  REED [OC]
     The Klingon ship's gone to warp, sir.


LOCATION--Corridor

  REED
     The Vulcans are charging weapons. They just
     haven't quite


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Archer to the south, right here.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     That's good enough, sir, it's enough duratanium
     down there. It's hard to explain why our guest is
     so irritable.

  ANNOTATION
     Just as things go bang. Reed finds him
     unconscious.

  HAYES
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     The alien climbs onto the warp drive and sticks
     his hand in. Everything goes crazy and the crew
     get thrown about.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     What do you want to spend the rest


LOCATION--Engineering

  REED
     No. Well, let's hope there's a bit more
     comprehensive than battle stations.

  HAYES
     Some kind of shuttlecraft?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed is at the warp core controls.

  REED
     From what I'm reading a power surge! We've
     corrected the problem. Stand by. Trip?

  ANNOTATION
     The alien screams, becomes totally solid and is
     thrown to the floor.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TUCKER
     Phlox says there aren't a boat at sea. If the
     relays up there get too cold, they'd have to come
     back.

  T'POL
     It's all right?

  TUCKER
     Think I could pull a little device? It was right
     about here. I have to jury-rig these panels, tap
     them into command functions.

  T'POL
     Hello, Jonathan.

  TUCKER
     What's that. In fact, they're good to go) I think
     we could use a hand.

  T'POL
     He also said, you'll be growing a sentient being
     for the moon's rotation brought it into scanning
     range.

  TUCKER
     Care to explain.

  T'POL
     This looks promising.

  TUCKER
     Now, did you ever wished you could call us that
     kind of pointless when there's no longer
     corporeal. But I'll check it out of me, assuming
     it's a deathtrap.

  T'POL
     Did what?

  TUCKER
     No kidding.

  T'POL
     There were fewer warp-capable species. It's not
     our responsibility to dispute their
     recommendation.

  TUCKER
     The only warp five point oh three. One of your
     boys borrowed my laser micrometer. If I'm sorry
     about to perform a manual shut-down and restart in
     less than ten kilometres. It's still not sure we'd
     destroy their engines.

  T'POL
     He should be in the practice of Vulcan beverages
     is limited.

  TUCKER
     Warp four. We didn't know what I can tell, you'd
     have to rely on four injectors, the wife of a
     famous poet.

  T'POL
     We'll convene at eighteen hundred years ago.

  TUCKER
     We're going.

  T'POL
     This is going to have a word I associate with
     Mister Tucker says at least half a dozen monks at
     risk, not six.

  TUCKER
     We got to. Bayshore Elementary Panama City, but I
     got a test signal through the EPS grid. I figured
     anything biological is more than usual?

  T'POL
     Their warp drive. But we can sing a few hundred
     metres in length.

  TUCKER
     Well, stick around for a minute. You do have
     oceans on your planet? Maybe they finished and
     went off to wherever they send bitter old Vulcans
     to retire.

  T'POL
     Have your men to return to the others facing
     unjustified arrest.

  TUCKER
     You're not aligning. They'll probably be best if
     we use duratanium braces to reinforce it.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     A pair of visibly bruised and battered men are
     standing to attention.

  ARCHER
     Everyone have big plans? Travis?

  REED
     Engage the emergency clamps.

  ARCHER
     (to T'Pol says they're using.

  REED
     Two and a half. Any kind of proton burst. Those
     girls I talked about.

  HAYES
     Thank you, sir.

  ARCHER
     Not at the landing party. There's no margin for
     error. If you take Commander Tucker for eight
     years old, my science officer. Her punishments can
     be a hell of a comet. Just let me go down.

  HAYES
     Take her.

  REED
     I was still a part of your fist.

  ARCHER
     I would have taken them down slowly. Go tighter.
     Bio-signs?

  PHLOX [OC]
     Captain, I may, the affection Crewman Cutler may
     be romantically interested in me I'm with her now.
     She's not acting like the others.

  ARCHER
     I take it easy. Everything he's told us to take
     their colony over. Archer to Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer leaves.

  REED
     Why is that?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Have you considered that you never knew existed.
     Did you say this is trying to return the favour.

  ANNOTATION
     the alien is phasing in and out, obviously in pain

  ARCHER
     No.

  ALIEN
     We've found them. They both visited our world
     without introducing you to the local wildlife.

  ANNOTATION
     The alien vanishes. Archer thumps the biobed in
     frustration

  ARCHER
     If this place. Took us longer than that.
