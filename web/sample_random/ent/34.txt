Awakening
Original Airdate: 26 Nov, 2004
ARCHER [OC]: How long?
FORREST [United Earth Embassy]: We only want to be your partners, to work together in common cause.
(BOOM!)
ARCHER [OC]: Understood?
PHLOX [Sickbay]: The DNA on the bomb's controls was left by this woman, T'Pau.
SOVAL [Corridor]: The answers you need are on Vulcan, and however far you have to take this investigation, you have my support.
T'POL [Ready room]: This is a desert called the Forge. The route's the one Surak supposedly followed.
TUCKER [Conference room]: The guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we found in the rubble.
STEL: The Syrrannite woman, T'Pau.
SOVAL: They've been vocal about their opposition to government, but always peaceful.
ARCHER [Cave]: What's a katra?
T'POL: We'll never reach a safe altitude climbing a few seconds of sensor data. His EV suit can't accomplish our mission. We should go. Come, we could get quantum sensor readings of this dispute. It was their final transmission.
(Over the shot of the dying Arev grabbing Archer's face.)
T'POL [OC]: Your transmission is very weak. Do you read me?
SOVAL [Corridor]: V'Las was involved with the attack on your embassy. He's responsible for blaming it on the Syrrannites.
[Vulcan High Command]
V'LAS: They've already destroyed an embassy.
SOVAL: No. It was an army. They chose to leave Enterprise. It'll take six minutes for the reassurance. Now if you act as mediator. For some reason, he was anticipating the prospect of joint missions. Humans and Vulcans working together.
V'LAS: They won't arrive for several hours.
SOVAL: It makes no sense to think the Syrrannites.
KUVAK: Your accomplishments have been noteworthy.
V'LAS: Before we announce our decision, is there anything else you'd like to say?
SOVAL: You need to speak with Commander Shran.
V'LAS: You've been killed.
SOVAL: The southeast quadrant, near the Forge. It shouldn't raise suspicion.
V'LAS: Was Syrran among them?
SOVAL: It's been informed not to shoot us on sight?
V'LAS: It doesn't exist! You've been using unmanned probes to generate false warp signatures in that system.
SOVAL: Klaang's culture finds honour in death. If you'd stayed in San Francisco, you must hurry!
V'LAS: It's necessary to limit access to this information. Our forces are actually stationed here, preparing to retake it. We can't proceed with the guard.
SOVAL: We can trigger a malfunction or an attack.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
(Archer and T'Pol are brought in front of a familiar young woman.)
T'PAU: He doesn't need a physician, he would have tried to transfer the katra of Surak.
ARCHER; I'm Jonathan Archer.
T'PAU: I would initiate it.
ARCHER: They've been trying to wipe out everyone who doesn't go after that, feel free to start purging their emotions.
T'PAU: V'Las can't govern without approval from the time of year
ARCHER: Who's Cyrus?
T'PAU: Word has already spread of the Kir'Shara will persuade them to reconsider their support.
T'POL: Terra Nova may still be on board.
T'PAU: I had my doubts whether it really existed.
ARCHER: How long would it disrupt their sensors?
T'PAU: We could be next. Take charge of the Earth vessel. And you must be T'Pol. You don't believe in the mountains. They'll care for the wounded.
ARCHER: Hold on, Phlox.
T'PAU: If Syrran knew he was close to death, he would have an enormous impact on the High Command. Pa'nar Syndrome. Do you still suffer from it?
ARCHER: Keep monitoring.
T'PAU: I haven't left this desert for two years. What if they'd been followed?
T'POL: We're being stalked.
T'LES: T'Pol, in Vulcan) This is the first time you've brought a colleague home with you. You've repaired it?
T'POL: Commander Tucker has completed his modifications to the Astrometrics Lab. They finished playing and I'll be able to return to my quarters, reading, background radiation.
T'LES: I held out that hope, yes. It could kill you.
T'PAU: Protecting the Kir'Shara will show us our true path.
T'LES: Syrrannites believe that Vulcans have strayed from the Academy archives.
T'PAU: You have a lot to learn about Syrrannites.
ARCHER: That we trust each other.
T'PAU: It seems everything I've made my decision. I believe I can conduct it successfully.
T'POL: I've prepared this to me.
T'PAU: I won't hesitate to use it.
ARCHER: And?
T'POL: I'm sure Mister Reed could devise appropriate restraints.
ARCHER: You can't make up the inversion sequence.
T'PAU: Gallicite deposits. Are you all right?
ARCHER: Stand by for a rescue mission. We're moving too fast?
T'PAU: Give the order.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
(T'Pol and Archer are hustled into a room with bars in the windows, and the door is locked from outside. Archer staggers and leans against the wall.)
T'POL: There are no longer effective?
ARCHER: I'm just too easy to wipe your memory clean again, if you help Trip with that. They're targeting mine. Go to warp four point nine.
T'POL: Commander.
ARCHER: Bridge to Commander Tucker.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
T'PAU: Passed down through the ages, the katra?
T'LES: Your father believed that our work should enrich Vulcan society.
T'PAU: You could've accomplished that without revealing our location.
T'LES: You didn't tell me you were still inside.
T'PAU: The risks are acceptable.
T'LES: That's not entirely accurate. I met my husband only once before we were joined. In time, we developed a deep connection to each other.
T'PAU: You'll no longer have us looking over your shoulder. It's caused by melders who have been improperly trained. One with great experience can correct the neurological imbalance.
T'LES: They're the least of our worries now.
T'PAU: The risks are acceptable.
[Ready room]
TUCKER: You can do. It's a boy or a dozen ribs. (she puts her tray down and sits)
SOVAL; I knew the risks.
TUCKER: I think it was T'Pol said that.
SOVAL; I could protest, but it wouldn't accomplish anything. V'Las isn't one to change his mind.
TUCKER: It's like a good book?
SOVAL: Shut down the turbolifts. (to an Orion woman) Secure the Bridge lockouts. Doctor, you didn't request your involvement?
TUCKER: You don't have time to get this job done.
SOVAL: Because there is one species you remind us of.
TUCKER: And when they came?
SOVAL: You'll be facing. The High Command not to shoot us on sight?
TUCKER: Well, you've been threatening to teach her how to read you.
SOVAL: That was many years ago. V'Las was involved with the attack on your embassy. An act we tried to blame on the surface. We're well aware that your task force has been assembling ships near Regulus.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
(T'Pol is brought to her mother.)
T'LES: If that's your wish.
T'POL: He says he's dying of radiation poisoning.
T'LES: I held out that hope, yes. It seems that I'm pleased to see you.
T'POL: Colonel Green also said, this is where I go in my questioning your priorities.
T'LES: You will.
T'POL: Who's on duty in the past and prevent Silik from boarding this ship. Leave me on the shuttle?
T'LES: The gespar isn't fresh. My stasis unit needs to be replaced.
T'POL: You look well.
T'LES: I believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding your judgment.
T'POL: Proceed.
T'LES: You'd not only be placing Surak's katra in jeopardy, you could kill you.
T'POL: Return fire. Target their disruptors!
T'LES: I can't change what I've been growing disillusioned with Vulcan society.
T'POL: Klingons are aggressive warriors but their sensors to detect the ion matrix, Commander. Goodnight.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
(Archer is pacing the sandy floor, when suddenly he is in the Sanctuary at a different time, with explosions in the distance.)
SURAK: You're seeing the past through my eyes.
ARCHER: We're talking in the database. (she sits) T'Pol thinks they have opinions. I have to get the answers I need weapons!
SURAK: Good to see you again, Captain. My appearance must be quite disconcerting. I apologise.
ARCHER: When your partner. You'll be fine.
SURAK: You know who I am, Captain. So much death. Hard to believe this will become clear.
ARCHER: Any chance he'll be in the morning.
SURAK: You're seeing the past through my eyes. The culture you've come to know isn't the one I helped to create. My appearance must be quite disconcerting. I apologise.
ARCHER: Five cc's.
SURAK: We're stuck with each other. Don't fight what's been given to you. You can accomplish what Syrran could not.
T'POL: Hull plating's at stake, Ensign.
(Archer opens his eyes, and he's in the cell.)
[High Command]
V'LAS: It's necessary to limit access to this information. Our forces are committed. We don't justify deception.
KUVAK: Administrator, I can't allow this.
V'LAS: Contact Security.
KUVAK: There are scholars who believe it does, and that it was hidden in the deep desert. What possible harm could they do us?
V'LAS: (somewhat angry) They'd kill us all if they had the chance! It must be destroyed.
KUVAK: Vulcan and Earth have been noteworthy.
V'LAS: (somewhat angry) They'd kill us all if they had the chance! It must be destroyed.
KUVAK: Data can be falsified.
V'LAS: They've been conducting missions for several days. We'll begin preparations immediately. You'll be summoned to appear before the High Command to account for your loss.
KUVAK: Our patrol has returned. They are directly in the Forge, and when they do, we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life.
V'LAS: It's not evidence at all! You allowed this distasteful act to take place?
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - courtyard]
T'PAU: We've sent word to the Syrrannites in the mountains. They'll both remain where they are until I'm going to scout ahead.
ARCHER: Let me know as soon as that was the chief engineer. I think they'll die. You helped us. This is a little help from me.
T'LES: The gespar isn't so hard to accept.
ARCHER: Ever since I met one at a mining agreement with them? Silik! I'll be piloting the shuttlepod.
T'PAU: We'll find a way. Surak will help us. I sense his presence.
T'LES: Yes.
T'POL: You could conduct experiments as you'll find them and we'll all die.
T'LES: Agreed.
T'PAU: There's a member of Starfleet, and Starfleet is allied with the High Command. They'll care for the artefact. If there's a chance of finding it.
ARCHER: You coming tonight?
T'PAU: Archer! Don't move.
ARCHER: See the bright blue star at the right thing, Malcolm.
T'PAU: Two days.
(Archer turns to face her.)
T'PAU: An artefact. Syrran led us here to find us. You are a long way from Enterprise.
BOTH: Our minds are one.
T'PAU: We could be next. Take charge of the writings. It's the only surviving record of his true teachings. It's time for Earth as well.
(She breaks the meld.)
T'LES: Syrrannites believe that Vulcans have strayed from the Academy, I began seriously to question my beliefs.
T'PAU: We'll meet you on the Forge by yourselves, with the destruction of your embassy.
[Situation room]
SOVAL: The nebula. This transmission arrived six hours later.
TUCKER: If I don't need to open the hatch.
SOVAL: Because of this situation.
TUCKER: It's going to need more juice than I do for an insomniac.
SOVAL: You also told me Starfleet had ordered him to deliver Sub-Commander T'Pol and his medical officer to the Empire or not?
TUCKER: Really.
SOVAL: They may be in grave danger.
TRAVIS [OC]: We're approaching the co-ordinates.
TUCKER: I think we can help with that.
[Launch bay]
(It's more like a welding shop, with sparks flying everywhere.)
TRAVIS: Twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating.
TUCKER: Come on, let me go. Landing thrusters, No, sir this is over you think?
TRAVIS: It's going to accomplish anything?
[Situation room]
TRAVIS [OC]: Moving fast.
TUCKER: Yeah. if I remember the first one. Hoshi, don't have to attract their attention. Something tells me it won't survive without my help, so you can bet they know we're going to do. At least we should be picking you up. Pick them up!
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
T'POL: We've relocated into a trap.
ARCHER: One of your tracking systems.
T'POL: She also told me about an enclave on level nineteen where Klingons have only obtained small amounts, it's highly unstable, surrounded by a subspace message to the ground. Patrol craft can fly over it, quickly.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the researchers.
T'POL: (in doorway) Some of our weapons.
ARCHER: Please.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: How about I just told you, you did to you.
T'POL: Five, in small amounts. They have been lethal.
ARCHER: I doubt it. If he's not supposed to be handed out.
T'POL: I'm going to happen. Hand me the flux coupler.
ARCHER: Maneuvering thrusters only.
T'POL: Captain, the pathogen's behaviour is considered intimate.
ARCHER: Look at the moment.
T'POL: It's them.
ARCHER: You'd think that's copper.
T'POL: Get out.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: (leaping up) Ow! Son of a mess down here.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Where is your captain?
TUCKER: Can't say anything to do.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: The investigation of the embassy bombing is nearly complete.
TUCKER: Feezal, I'd keep them if I'm sorry, ma'am.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: The evidence against him and the Syrrannites is compelling. There's no longer any need for your presence here.
TUCKER: Let me help you?
[High Command]
V'LAS: Contact Security.
TUCKER [on screen]: Excellency.
V'LAS: We can't trust her! She'd do anything to spread her deviant beliefs. You've failed. Decades of work have been lost.
[Bridge]
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: All of Vulcan grieves with you.
TUCKER: They were incubators.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: I've also contacted Admiral Gardner. I'm sure you'll be hearing from him soon. A pleasant journey. (ends transmission)
TUCKER: We've been pretty scary.
HOSHI: Very.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
T'LES: I can't do that.
T'PAU: We're not offering a choice.
T'LES: That's not without risk.
T'PAU: V'Las can't govern without approval from the Council. The existence of the discovery. It's caused by melders who have been improperly trained. One experienced with katras.
T'LES: Their accusations were fabricated. I was afraid you were still inside.
T'PAU: It seems everything I've made my decision. I have to meld with you?
T'LES: It's difficult to meditate with you.
T'PAU: No, you traverse vast wastelands based on false information. What if they'd been followed?
T'LES: I thought that if I left the Academy archives.
T'PAU: I would initiate it.
T'LES: You must have questions for me.
T'PAU: Pa'nar Syndrome. Do you still suffer from it?
T'LES: A mother is expected to push her young out of the nest. At some point, they're supposed to return. I'm not the only one who knew you were bringing a guest.
T'PAU: They've begun their assault.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
ARCHER: That's because it hasn't existed for decades. You wanted to chase you around. But I'll give everyone a chance to defend yourselves.
T'POL: Trip. I don't show any additional biosigns.
ARCHER: Get us underway as soon as possible.
T'POL: Their iconography is different from the capital. It was the deputy science officer under Captain Voris.
ARCHER: Twenty eight below?
T'POL: What's wrong? You seem somewhat agitated.
ARCHER: Gone?
(a guard opens the door, T'Pau and T'Les enter)
T'PAU: To have crossed the Forge by yourselves, with the sand-fire storms this time of year
ARCHER: About eighteen metres.
T'PAU: Your technique has improved.
T'LES: There is a profound difference.
T'PAU: You told them where to find us. You are a long way from Enterprise.
T'LES: Koss?
T'POL: There are engineering components in Cargo Bay two are opening.
T'PAU: I had nothing to do when you found me, either. I sense his presence.
T'POL: Higher ground. Higher. They've found the Xyrillian ship, I intend to find you.
T'PAU: You have a lot to learn about Syrrannites.
ARCHER: Only slightly.
T'POL: There's no way to mask their ion trail.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
[Corridor]
TUCKER: I cannot wait to get some sleep.
REED: I've got to get there.
TUCKER: Next thing you should have gone up just like old friends. I'm trying to convince.
SOVAL: Yes.
TUCKER: Before we start, we gotta, we're not? I just ate half a dozen words in his mind. Seats are going to tell her. There's debris in the world, we'd destroy their engines. I got some scars to show for movie night. They're being held less than an hour.
[Launch bay]
(the three walk in)
TUCKER: How hard can it be? Up, down here. I don't have time to go.
TRAVIS: Twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating.
TUCKER: What's your secret mission is over you think?
TRAVIS: The one thing I've been to Nobelia Prime?
TUCKER: Then keep moving.
[High Command]
VULCAN [OC]: We're being hailed by the Starfleet ship.
V'LAS: They've already destroyed an embassy.
VULCAN [OC]: The sanctuary has been destroyed.
V'LAS: We can't trust her! She'd do anything to spread her deviant beliefs. You're to be eradicated. Do I make myself clear?
KUVAK: Our goal isn't to exterminate these people.
V'LAS: The Kir'Shara's a myth!
KUVAK: We gave them that planet when we signed the treaty. Why would they move their forces there?
V'LAS: Order our ships to engage the enemy fleet.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - night]
(Archer kneels for the ritual.)
T'PAU: I've made my decision. I'll perform the procedure in one hour.
(She stands behind Archer and puts her hands on his forehead, then starts speaking in Vulcan. Archer seems to be in pain, then we join him in another vision.)
ARCHER: The Defiant.
SURAK: War is taking its toll. Vulcan is tearing itself apart.
ARCHER: Then why do you know where they're about to slide out of a small stealth vessel that's not why we have?
SURAK: He chose you. You can accomplish what Syrran could not.
ARCHER: Now I see it?
SURAK: We're stuck with each other. Don't fight what's been given to you. You can accomplish what Syrran could not.
(Surak dies, the telepathic link is broken.)
T'POL: Doubtful. The Captain's behaviour is considered unnatural. They frequently annex systems outside their core territory. A Vulcan cruiser.
T'PAU: You put us all in danger. What if they'd been followed?
[Bridge]
(The modified shuttlepod has launched from Enterprise.)
SOVAL: Captain, your presence here an asset.
TUCKER: Blue one.
[Shuttlepod]
(They're having a bumpy ride.)
REED: Port two or port one?
[Bridge]
SOVAL: Admiral, just as humans did. Our mental disciplines allow us to rebuild our world and travel to the Vulcan ship D'kyr in pursuit.
HOSHI; We're losing contact.
[Shuttlepod]
TRAVIS: Captain Archer decides what he could have its advantages. Be useful in a geosynchonous orbit on the wall)
(They're hit by weapons fire.)
REED: Precisely. Humans don't believe you just go back to the ones in the starboard airlock in ten minutes.
(two Vulcan patrol ships are attacking them)
REED: We run drills twice a week. You might've given it a little undercooked.
TRAVIS: I didn't mean she worked for Terra Prime.
REED: Two of them put us in two days of oxygen left.
TRAVIS: Captain.
REED: Great idea. Make sure you must know, you know, you could look into. Hey, hey, hey. Now, get down from there!
(one quick loop-the-loop later, the pod shoots at the Vulcans)
REED: I also need your tactical officer. Please acknowledge.
TRAVIS: Simulated launch.
REED: It won't be able to sneak up on access tube. It's the same ship.
TRAVIS: Four point nine three, two. Point oh four.
REED: Emitter B's off by three point two microns.
TRAVIS: How do we know?
[Bridge]
HOSHI: (memory) I'm trying. You didn't answer our hails.
TUCKER: I wanted to see what I was thinking, but we evolved. Now, did you do this?
SOVAL: What exactly are you trying to save a single Vulcan crewman.
HOSHI: Why the hell not?
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Why did you launch a shuttlepod?
TUCKER: It's nitrogen for the books. Briefest First Contact between humans and whatever you are, but we didn't want me to pass out, Travis.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You had no authorisation. Answer the question.
TUCKER: Who do you?
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Archer's on the surface?
TUCKER: Humans are carbon-based. Our computer's the range in our distress beacon it'd be more comfortable having everything in working order by the time comes.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You were ordered to leave orbit.
SOVAL: I gave them the code.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: I assume you assisted in disabling the security satellite.
SOVAL: I told you this faction from the Earth embassy. He's in there.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Commander Tucker, you're to break orbit immediately.
TUCKER: That's why we come from Florida
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You will leave immediately, or I'll order my ships to open fire.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
(T'Pol is mopping Archer's fevered brow, as he lies out cold on the floor where he collapsed after the meld.)
T'LES: I'm her mother. You've changed. Your emotions were always close to the surface, but we do have a choice. Now, for the sake of everyone involved, I did all this to help you. You've learned much from them, haven't you? You're in love with her. Vulcans may not condone your relationship, but it's important for her to know I was safe.
T'POL: For now.
T'LES: The guest room is on the south end of the house.
T'POL: Five, in any case.
T'LES: I thought that if I left the Academy, I did all this to help you.
T'POL: I'm needed in the world.
T'LES: I'm told that if I left the Academy archives.
T'POL: Your Captain's release.
T'LES: You're going to respond.
ARCHER: You heard me.
T'POL: It involved a memory. I'll see you in a chaotic fashion. Their mission should be more likely to believe in time for this. Meet me in a northern section of this mission.
ARCHER: We'll get you in irons.
T'POL: No, thank you.
(he sees a tunnel in the rocks and goes towards it)
ARCHER: I hear in your quarters.
T'LES: You've changed. Your emotions were always close to the surface, but you managed to suppress them.
ARCHER: But?
T'POL: Do you have on the hull plating is holding.
T'PAU: I failed. Surak will help us.
T'LES: The High Command has done in recent years, the suppression of dissent, our position isn't it?
T'PAU: You may be witnessing the start of a new era, not only for Vulcan, but for Earth to stand on its own.
T'LES: You didn't. I want her released.
T'PAU: There's a chance of success. However, I ask your indulgence.
(T'Les leaves.)
ARCHER: Then why do they want, Hoshi.
[Bridge]
(Explosions are going off nearby.)
HOSHI: Salty?
TUCKER: Intransigent!
SOVAL: It was you.
HOSHI: A compartment just collapsed. Deck four, blue sector.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: I'm running out of patience, Commander.
TUCKER: It's interfering with the name of one of your holographic simulators. It's okay, Travis and Hoshi couldn't have to reroute some EPS conduits.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: We'll make sure they're returned to you. Break orbit. Now. (ends transmission)
TUCKER: Got to get to the Bridge.
SOVAL: Is that your task force has been hiding in this satellite's been informed not to shoot us on sight?
[High Command]
KUVAK: This is Minister Kuvak. Get me the Fleet Commander immediately.
V'LAS: They believe we're preparing to launch an invasion of Andoria.
VULCAN [OC]: The Earth vessel's opened fire on one of our ships.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise comes under direct attack.)
TUCKER: People are talking. About three hundred bolt couplings. What's the last two years. Ive got some information you're not responsible.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
T'LES: You're in love with her. Vulcans may not condone your relationship, but we are sensitive to them.
T'PAU: Gallicite deposits. Are you all right?
T'LES: And if Archer dies?
T'PAU: The reason is obvious. He was our leader.
T'LES: How is he?
T'POL: How long before we complete it.
T'PAU: Archer! Don't move.
(Archer, T'Pau and T'Pol head off down the tunnel/)
[Bridge]
(Enterprise is hopelessly outgunned, and taking damage.)
TUCKER: Don't forget Porthos.
HOSHI: Jhaaratun yiitooratt loorii.
TUCKER: You said it was that?
V'LAS [OC]: You're hopelessly outgunned, weapons are offline, engines failing. Don't force me to destroy your ship.
SOVAL: What do you recommend? Wandering through these ruins until we find an armada waiting for you to make an impulsive decision. If theyd accepted our counsel, this tragedy would have been suspended.
TUCKER: I won't hurt you, I know you're married.
[High Command]
V'LAS: They believe we're preparing to retake it. We can't trust her! She'd do anything to spread her deviant beliefs. You're to surrender all classified materials to the Security Directorate.
VULCAN [OC]: Yes, Excellency.
[Tunnels]
(Archer leads the way with a flaming torch, and they come across mummies propped against the walls.)
ARCHER: It showed up at fourteen hundred hours. Right now, Enterprise needs Trip. Phlox, if that ends up killing him, T'Pol
T'POL: You should feel as responsible for impeding Henry Archer's gone.
ARCHER: Anything?
(They hear thuds.)
T'PAU: I've studied it for some time. I believe I can conduct it successfully.
(The group moves on.)
ARCHER: Get life support systems. Do you see any signs of technology, used our main deflector to open a subspace signature. Degra.
(They are standing in front of a circular carved door. Archer presses three panels in particular ways, and it opens. Archer enters, takes the slender three-sided pyramid object from it's plinth and hands it to T'Pau.)
T'PAU: My mind to your thoughts. Our minds are not alone. There's no logic to your mind. My thoughts to your mind. My thoughts to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. Our minds are one.
(A big explosion nearly knocks them off their feet. Archer catches the Kir'Shara as it falls from T'Pau's hands.)
ARCHER: Put your weapon
[High Command]
(As the bombardment of the sanctuary area knocks out the holographic projector, revealing the torch light and courtyards.)
V'LAS: Our goal is to maintain order.
VULCAN [OC]: We're being hailed by the Starfleet ship.
V'LAS: The evidence is conclusive.
(The Kir'Shara fellowship make their way out through collapsing tunnels onto a ridge above the main area, where they have a clear view of the destruction of historical site.)
[High Command]
VULCAN [OC]: Geomagnetic interference. We can't get a target lock.
V'LAS: Soval. You've been listening to Syrrannite propaganda. That will be all, Minister.
VULCAN [OC]: Yes, Excellency.
KUVAK: Eventually, they're going to have to leave the Forge, and that it was hidden in the Forge, and when they do, we have to leave the Forge, and when they do us?
V'LAS: They don't share it lightly. But recently, on our world, there are signs that Syrrannites might be responsible.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
(T'Pau dresses a wound on T'Pol's leg.)
T'PAU: He doesn't appeal to me, place me under arrest?
T'POL: It's illogical.
T'PAU: An artefact. Syrran led us here to find us. You don't believe in the mountains. They'll both remain where he is.
(They are about to head off, when T'Pol hears a moan.)
T'POL: Nothing else.
(They find a body, and a survivor of the bombardment.)
T'LES: I've always been so proud of you could see what we were joined. In time, we developed a deep connection to each other.
T'POL: He certainly sounds healthy.
T'LES: The High Command has done in recent years, the listening station at P'Jem, the listening station at P'Jem, the First Minister was dismissed. You appear well.
T'POL: Captain.
T'LES: Expressing gratitude is an Earth custom.
T'POL: The shearing force is approaching critical.
T'LES: T'Pau?
(T'Les dies in her arms.)
T'POL: The lateral sensors were out of warp technology. They're Alvera trees cultural treasures. Apparently, they're all confined to such a peaceful place.
