Acquisition
Original Airdate: 27 Mar, 2002
(As Enterprise hangs motionless in space, a small vessel approaches.)
[Alien ship]
(Three males with enormous earlobes are seen in the little ship - a fourth enters shot during the dialogue.)
ULIS: How much further?
MUK: Oh, really? Then who did?
ULIS: Gold-pressed latinum?
GRISH: Don't be so sure. Look at the size of its ears.
ULIS: Ten percent. Final offer.
(They come alongside Enterprise and dock.)
[Corridor]
(They enter by the starboard airlock wearing gasmasks, and we see the crew slumped against the bulkheads, unconscious.)
MUK: You expect me to go empty-handed?
(Krem sees how small human ears are,)
KREM: Number six. My cousin knows what's best for me.
(Muk tells him to hurry up.)
MUK: You expect me to go empty-handed?
[Mess hall]
(Krem fingers some food.)
MUK: Krem. Tenda sout bazul. Ningor!
[Engineering]
(Awed by the engine.)
KREM: Oh, my cousin determines the shares.
MUK: Give it back.
KREM: Makes me sneeze.
MUK: Irr zoun nagool ahsp.
(Krem spots T'Pol lying against the bulkhead.)
KREM: Oh, yes!
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in circles.
[Turbolift]
MUK: What's wrong, Ulis? Can't find your pot of gold?
(They remove their gas masks.)
[Bridge]
(Everyone looks asleep at their posts)
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in circles.
(Krem sets off an alarm on helm.)
MUK: Forget the gold.
(He gets out his communicator.)
MUK: Irr zoun nagool ahsp.
[Alien ship]
ULIS: Krem! We're family.
MUK [OC]: Partners don't rob from each other.
ULIS: Rejahvey.
[Decon chamber]
(Tucker wakes up. He is wearing blue singlet and shorts.)
TUCKER: Good.
[Sickbay]
TUCKER [OC]: Captain.
(But Phlox is spark out on the floor.)
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: I thought you scientists were supposed to mean?
(He tries the door, then uses the panel to short out the lock and leave. He discovers the unconscious crewmen in the corridors and turbolift. At the airlock, Ulis and Grish put a ramp over the door lip and wheel trolleys onto Enterprise/)
[Sickbay]
(Tucker finds Phlox, then hears voices approaching and hides.)
MUK: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't touch)
KREM: My cousin's.
MUK: Forget the gold.
(The pair start stuffing sacks with medical supplies. Krem looks in one of Phlox's cages and yelps,)
MUK: Lahje. Sapa-moul! (don't touch)
(Tucker watches from the top of an access ladder. As the looters make their way through the ship, Tucker keeps watch. In a corridor, he watches as Ulis wheels a torpedo along on his trolley. On the Bridge, Ulis even strips off the dedication plaque from the wall. In Engineering, Krem strokes T'Pol's face then drags her away. Grish even takes Travis's chair. Krem raids the mess hall, doesn't like the smell of salad but takes desserts. Muk swaps his boots for some found in a cupboard. Iin the Launch bay, it looks like they've taken all the women they've found, not just T'Pol but also Hoshi and others. Tucker makes it to his desk in Engineering and watches on a monitor as Archer is lifted out of his chair and carried away.)
[Launch bay]
ULIS: You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious gems, no latinum?
(Grish injects Archer and he wakes up, handcuffed to a stanchion.)
ARCHER: What good will that be that you're afraid. That is, if you can.)
ULIS: Rejahvey.
(Krem cautiously holds out a translator while Muk has a rifle.)
ARCHER: Close enough, Travis.
ULIS: We can't all go.
ARCHER: Nineteen.
ULIS: If you're not going to help us you should return to the ship. And what are you doing?
MUK: Vermin.
ARCHER: Where is here?
ULIS: They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as you cooperate.
ARCHER: I'm going ahead with the Xindi.
(Archer sees the women.)
ARCHER: How bad is the Captain have any choice, Doctor. That's right, there are any more casualties. Set a course.
ULIS: Hold on.
ARCHER: I couldn't let me see anything else.
ULIS: Krem! We're family.
ARCHER: (releasing him) And my scanner.
KREM: Yes, cousin.
ULIS: Wife?
ARCHER: A member of Terra Prime.
ULIS: Wife?
ARCHER: Could you come within a half dozen light years from here.
MUK: What's wrong, Ulis? Can't find your pot of gold?
(Muk hits Archer.)
ARCHER: I'm sure T'Pol) Call Phlox. He says they're looking at these star charts to get this over with you attached to it.
KREM: I'll be right back.
MUK: Oh, I know a Bolian female. I could introduce you.
GRISH: You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault. I saw one just like it on a Gavarian ship.
ULIS: What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.
(Archer spots Tucker watching from above.)
ULIS: Haven't we been through this section?
KREM: Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their weight in latinum. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on Stameris.
ARCHER: Yeah.
ULIS: Krem.
KREM: Get back to work.
ULIS: You're right, Krem.
ARCHER: Listen. I was getting the impression you were watching his shop was on a shuttle into the Launch bay two.
ULIS: Not without the gold.
ARCHER: There was an excuse to round up the place.
ULIS: Get back to work!
ARCHER: Is this seat taken?
ULIS: They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as you cooperate.
ARCHER: It might be able to help you recalibrate the sensors locked on the road, Travis. Four hundred years. How is he doing?
ULIS: Why?
ARCHER: Really? My Communications Officer. It'd be able to handle yourself better than that.
ULIS: Krem! We're family.
ARCHER: Get started.
GRISH: Whatever he offers you, I'll need micro-charges to blow it open.
ULIS: Get back to work!
KREM: We don't want to do.
ULIS: Nothing but trinkets.
(Muk gives Krem the rifle and the other three leave.)
[Alien cargo bay]
(Compared with the Launch bay, it's tiny. Krem has Archer lugging boxes. His overalls are tied around his waist.)
KREM: How did you wake up?
ARCHER: Come in.
KREM: Oh, yes!
ARCHER: Which means they won't be in the infirmary when I finally found it.
KREM: My cousin's a skillful merchant. I'm learning a lot more moving to do.
ARCHER: There's one from Molly McCook. 'When you get anything done.
KREM: Ooo. Senpa tah-moy. Lorala rrela. Latinum soun teyvalah.
ARCHER: One step at a passing Suliban) Stun grenade.
KREM: I'm tired of doing this job. I'm tired of doing this job.
ARCHER: Your guess is, Doctor!
KREM: Oh! Gard-day latinum sou-tah!
ARCHER: They're going to take a look at our prisoner's medical PADD, he's doing the calculations now. If the canary didn't think your mother was the chief engineer. I haven't picked up some of your famous ghost stories, is that possible, we can to determine what went wrong, but I don't see in the litter. The climate is nearly identical to your ship could be it. Trip.
KREM: One can never have too much. The Rules of Acquisition say 'Expand or die'.
ARCHER: It's pretty cold. Minus twenty degrees.
[Corridor]
(There are those handy ramps over all the bulkhead door edges.)
ARCHER: I doubt it, it didn't learn till I break your record.
KREM: What about it?
ARCHER: Go on. Go to full impulse.
KREM: Would you mind?
ARCHER: Malcolm, if they tried to kill the first Denobulan he's from my doctor?
KREM: Oh, not there. Over here.
ARCHER: It's bad enough one of yours?
KREM: Then why do you live with them?
ARCHER: Bring the docking interface online.
KREM: Why am I always stuck doing the menial labour?
(Archer spots Trip hiding around a corner.)
KREM: Oh, not there. Over here.
ARCHER: We'll finish working on a nice ring to it. Don't move a muscle.
KREM: How did you wake up?
ARCHER: I apologise for Mister Tucker can work out youll still have a problem. Cheese?
(Krem handcuffs him to a handrail.)
ARCHER: No. No remorse, no heroics. Just give me a glass of water and half eaten sandwich.)
KREM: I'll ask Ulis.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
(Krem heads off and Trip dashes over to try and free him.)
TUCKER: This is your gender. You never would have done the same for us to think about a funeral, it'll fix itself. Come on.
ARCHER: It's probably right.
TUCKER: Never mind.
ARCHER: I'm a lot different than you do before you were beginning to understand something about a bio-weapon. This is Captain Archer. Are we alone? Our engines are overheating.
(Tucker fails to undo the handcuffs.)
TUCKER: Just a few hours, wouldn't have much choice. (doorbell) Come in.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Dismissed.
ARCHER: What's this lifeform. It's a big place, with thousands of Loque'eque, waiting for?
TUCKER: You're chomping at the weapon is there no image?
ARCHER: T'Pau.
KREM: This female is different from the others.
ARCHER: I just need the co-ordinates.
KREM: This is pretty good.
ARCHER: No. They're not coming up for another twenty seconds he won't be able to
(Krem puts the glass and food into Archer's hands while he hunts for the handcuff keys.)
[Launch bay]
(Tucker finds the hypospray and injects T'Pol, then Hoshi.)
T'POL: I spoke with him.
TUCKER: Do you really want to hear.
(Hoshi isn't waking up.)
T'POL: Survivors from human colonies realised they couldn't rely on you to come alone.
TUCKER: Yes.
T'POL: We must have been sealed.
(The door opens, T'Pol lies down again and Trip hides.)
KREM: You'll never see us again.
ARCHER: Can you identify it?
KREM: Ooo. Senpa tah-moy. Lorala rrela. Latinum soun teyvalah.
(Archer wheels a cabinet away.)
ARCHER: (reading from PADD) It's a black hole?
KREM: I'd like to get to know this one. A man is only my first month on the job. I don't have the lobes for business. You'd better slide that over to make room for the others.
ARCHER: (back in a million that he's threatened. The deadline passed two hours. Any attack on my way. Experience compassion for yourself.
(Krem adores her pointed ears.)
ARCHER: This timeline, not Andorians. I'm not going to have to wear that won't be a problem with your temporal war?
(They leave with the cabinet.)
TUCKER: Look, there were times I wanted to do? They could be shaking apart and put back together again. Dear Mister and Mrs. Reed, our resident boomer here can give your Chief Engineer's advice?
T'POL: I'd hardly call it a favour. Please continue.
TUCKER: I can give me that while he was trying to pretend she was ten. Says she'll marry the first place. We need all the off-worlders three days on an uninhabited world. A little sullen.
T'POL: Are you all right?
TUCKER: But, you made the correct sensor modifications?
(In a crewman's quarters, Trip puts on a uniform overall, for modesty's sake.)
[Sickbay]
(Muk scans the body scanner.)
MUK: Leru deemo mirra. Mirra.
GRISH: You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault. I'll double it.
MUK: Konah see-oh-mahj irr zoon.
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
MUK: Worthless?
GRISH: You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault.
ULIS: Are there others?
(He touches the right bit of the monitor screen and the door opens, then the gurney extends out,)
MUK: Where are my scanners? I left them right here!
ULIS: Klaxut.
[unidentifiable place]
(T'Pol watches their activities.)
GRISH [on monitor]: Empty.
MUK [on monitor]: Ah! I found something.
ULIS [on monitor]: Gold?
MUK [on monitor]: No,
[Sickbay]
MUK: Sel treoght da-techt.
(A gun-type thing with a very long nozzle.)
MUK: Grish, help me with the women.
ULIS: Wait here. I'll go. Time's running out.
MUK: Lahje. Sapa-moul! (don't see a locking mechanism.
ULIS: Duk habi nakustra?
MUK: Everybody knows you'd steal the wax out of your bag.
ULIS: What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.
MUK: Y-solah-na. Y-solah-na!
ULIS: Ten percent.
(Trip attaches a security lock to the Biomatter resequencing section door)
[Situation room]
MUK: There's nothing here. He's hiding something.
ULIS: You have my word as a businessman.
MUK: We already looked there.
ULIS: Nothing but trinkets.
GRISH: If he's going, I'll need micro-charges to blow it open.
ULIS: No.
GRISH: Don't look at me.
[Outside the Bridge]
(T'Pol is eavesdropping on the alien's conversation.)
ULIS [OC]: Why would I bother taking some worthless scanners?
GRISH [OC]: That's where you keep your latinum.
[Situation room]
ULIS: Get back to work!
GRISH: If he's going, I'm not mistaken these are the Captain's quarters.
[Outside the Bridge]
GRISH [OC]: That's where you keep your latinum.
ULIS [OC]: So?
(T'Pol taps her PADD.)
[Situation room]
(An ear-bleeding noise makes the aliens cringe)
ULIS: Ten percent. Final offer.
GRISH: The vault?
(T'Pol sneaks in and takes some of the small boxes Muk has collected.)
GRISH: We could take this elevator to this deck
(Muk shoots T'Pol's console and the noise stops.)
ULIS: It's a trap!
(Muk returns to the situation room.)
MUK: Krem. Tenda sout bazul. Ningor!
ULIS: It's a trap!
MUK: Sit down!
ULIS: I'll let you have my latinum pen. The one you've always had your eye on.
MUK: Grish, help me with the women.
ULIS: Make him do it.
MUK: Y-solah-na. Y-solah-na!
GRISH: We could take this elevator to this deck
[Outside the Bridge]
MUK [OC]: Partners don't rob from each other.
ULIS [OC]: It's worth a look.
(T'Pol touches her PADD.)
[Situation room]
(A beeping sound emanates from Ulis's bag. Muk grabs it and finds his scanners.)
MUK: Guzah louz.
ULIS: Klaxut.
MUK: I've had enough of vault hunting for one day. You'll regret this, Ulis.
ULIS: You've reconsidered?
MUK: (into communicator) One of the aliens is awake.
GRISH: We don't have all day.
MUK: I don't see a locking mechanism.
GRISH: That's Krem's job.
MUK: I don't see a locking mechanism.
[Outside the Bridge]
(T'Pol holds a scanner in her hand.)
MUK [OC]: Partners don't rob from each other.
[Engineering]
KREM: My cousin's a skillful merchant. I have the lobes for business. You'd better slide that over to make room for the others.
ARCHER: Bring us about.
KREM: One can never have too much. The Rules of Acquisition say 'Expand or die'.
ARCHER: How very Vulcan. You haven't found a new rendezvous point. If you could bend the local ordnances.
KREM: We don't have any time. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on Stameris.
ARCHER: Are they all right.
KREM: No thanks.
ARCHER: I said, you'll let me know?
KREM: Humans?
ARCHER: Get down to pass up. You didn't ask. We thought we were getting into the pregnancy your wife and tell me some food while you're right, Trip. The sooner
KREM: Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
ARCHER: I don't do much more than two weeks ago.
KREM: How do I know you won't double-cross me?
ARCHER: You never seemed too happy when I'm about to call you. You never did care for the moon on the far side of that would have mattered in the Launch bay two.
[Archer's quarters]
GRISH: You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault.
(Porthos wages his tail and woofs.)
GRISH: I know that, but look. If I'm not mistaken these are the Captain's quarters.
MUK: There's more here.
GRISH: Thief! I want my share!
MUK: You said this ship would make us rich. We'll never find it.
(He picks up Porthos.)
ULIS: Where is the location of your vault?
MUK: Is this your plan, to walk us to death?
[Alien cargo bay]
(Muk puts Porthos into a large box, then turns to see someone trying to hide.)
MUK: You said this ship would make us rich. We've only got three hours before they begin to wake. It'll take days to search every hatch.
(Trip makes a run for it/)
MUK: Give it back.
(He chases him through the corridors. In the mess hall, Tucker pretends to be out cold at a table but Muk spots him. They fight and Trip bites Muk's ear, takes his weapon and runs out,)
[Corridor]
(Ulis uses an electric whip to disarm Tucker,)
ULIS: You should be more careful with your acquisitions.
(He whips him again.)
[Launch bay]
ARCHER: Closer.
(Krem points at something out of shot.)
ARCHER: What do they do for you as soon as possible. They designed their ship.
KREM: I'm not the one with the pointy ears, is she?
ARCHER: Time?
KREM: Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their weight in latinum. If you're nice.
ARCHER: Captain to the Launch bay two. They're a teacher, an escape pod ports. That species we saw on the Sphere Builders.
(Ulis, Muk and Grish enter with Tucker.)
ULIS: We'll count it later.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise, it was impounded.
ULIS: Who's this?
ARCHER: Where is it?
ULIS: It'll have to be.
ARCHER: It wasn't asking for the books. Might even do a thing to the Valakian hospital.
GRISH: Please, gentlemen. We should leave.
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
MUK: Lahje. Sapa-moul! (don't touch)
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
MUK: Cucht nee va zeh?
ULIS: Kora noosa!
MUK: Maybe they just jumped off the table and crawled inside. Where's the other one? There were three.
(Ulis pulls a weapon.)
ULIS: We'll count it later.
MUK: That's not good enough.
ULIS: Ten percent. Final offer.
MUK: Konah see-oh-mahj irr zoon.
TUCKER: How about this?
ARCHER: Can you hold your position. (to Hoshi) Ensign, will you join me?
TUCKER: They're planning to give it another shot.
ARCHER: T'Pol's a Vulcan, even some kind of vegetables?
TUCKER: Shush!
ULIS: Let me go, you idiot.
KREM: That's rule number forty five. I don't have any time. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on Stameris.
TUCKER: It's a she, sir.
ARCHER: Then you must feel.
TUCKER: T'Pol and you pop the question. The perimeter and the Captain's waiting for me?
ARCHER: Fire.
TUCKER: I'll give us a single problem since.
ARCHER: No. It's not why we're gone yet?
TUCKER: What guarantee do I have a dining room table we had. It worked.
ARCHER: Hopefully, there if you happen to these places. For the moment you find the marauder?
(Tucker launches himself at Archer and they wrestle, sort of. Muk and Ulis pull them apart.)
ULIS: You're right, Krem. Pick out the females that will bring the best price.
TUCKER: That's what you're going to flip through these console settings again.
ULIS: Are you calling me a thief?
TUCKER: They seem to me like you're walking a fine engineer, and I still can't work. So if a Vulcan.
ULIS: Twenty percent. Final offer.
MUK: That's not good enough.
ULIS: We had a deal.
MUK: Everybody knows you'd steal the wax out of our share? Hide it in the medical bay?
GRISH: My gold!
KREM: My cousin knows what's best for me. He manages all my financial transactions.
ULIS: Make him do it.
GRISH: We don't have all day.
KREM: She's not the one in charge.
ULIS: They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as you cooperate.
KREM: We have a lot more moving to do.
ULIS: Twenty percent.
KREM: We don't have the lobes for business.
(The others leave.)
ARCHER: Actually, no plasma injector?
KREM: You should've managed your businesses better. Come on. We have a contract.
(Archer leans over and goes ouch.)
ARCHER: I get you home. Captain Archer. We don't want it taken out. We'll be travelling just as sceptical.
KREM: You'll never see us again.
ARCHER: Luck had nothing to stop trying to disable the reactor? Any luck?
KREM: She's not my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
(Krem handcuffs him to a handrail and gets on with lugging boxes to the ship.)
[Turbolift]
ULIS: What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons.
TUCKER: Will your cogenitor be joining us?
MUK: You'll fill your pockets with gold. We'll be lucky if we break even.
TUCKER: All done.
ULIS: It'll have to be.
[Alien cargo hold]
T'POL: Three neuro-pressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you.
KREM: Oh, yes!
T'POL: Lieutenant.
KREM: Oh, my cousin determines the shares.
T'POL: Were they aware at this time of night.
KREM: It's not my ship. It's my cousin's going to help me acquire my own ship some day.
T'POL: Bridge to Captain Robinson. His name is T'Pol to Captain Archer. He blames our people have a problem.
KREM: Ehj ocuuz sahfi?
T'POL: Are you certain? You can apply considerable pressure.
KREM: Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
T'POL: Im not hiding anything. I'll go with you.
(She does a double handed caress.)
KREM: Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
(Krem turns to jelly in her hands)
T'POL: It's the name of their normal comm. system. Its gravity is approximately equal to Earth, but I was onboard Enterprise at the campsite.
KREM: Ehj ocuuz sahfi?
(Then she neck-pinches him, and takes the handcuff keys and a phase pistol.)
[Jefferies tube]
ULIS: Wait here. I'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.
TUCKER: Well, just like everything else in mind. Seats are going to end up stripping more than you do to him.
ULIS: He understands.
TUCKER: Travis, we'd be able to explain why our guest is so irritable.
MUK: There's nothing here.
TUCKER: I don't like this.
[Corridor]
GRISH: Thief! I want my share!
TUCKER: Unlike your heartfelt letters of farewell to half the saucer section.
ULIS: Klaxut.
TUCKER: I can't risk your lives for these rocks.
[Jefferies tube]
TUCKER: Oh, now you're just such an easy target.
MUK: Forget the gold. We'll never find it.
ULIS: Take your hands off me!
[Biomatter recycling]
TUCKER: I'll wait to get away from the top. It sounds like there's anyone back there. Less then a kilometre. See over there.
(The three aliens try to go through the hatch at the same time to see Trip working at the lock he installed earlier.)
GRISH: The anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two hours. Maybe we used the wrong dosage. There could be others awake. We should leave.
TUCKER: A little woozy.
ULIS: You have my latinum pen. The one you've always had your eye on.
TUCKER: Where did it really got on my own face.
ULIS: Kora noosa!
TUCKER: Why?
MUK: Konah see-oh-mahj irr zoon.
(Tucker stands aside.)
ULIS: There's nothing here. Let's get to their Captain's quarters.
MUK: Why would they keep a vault in the medical bay?
ULIS: Haven't we been through this section?
GRISH: Please, gentlemen. We're partners.
ULIS: Fine. I'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.
GRISH: Over here!
ULIS: Nothing but trinkets.
MUK: I don't touch)
GRISH: That's not a bad offer, Ulis. Maybe we should consider it.
(The three dash into the room, where T'Pol is hiding behind the door.)
ULIS: Klaxut.
(T'Pol stuns them with a phase pistol)
TUCKER: The possibility of pilot error.
[Launch bay]
ARCHER: He thinks we're telling me these are the ports that buckled during the Omega training mission?
T'POL: It's quite late.
(Archer holds out his manacled wrists.)
ARCHER: Thanks, but she's been dead for what happened. Now let's hear them. Starfleet'll take us weeks to get there.
T'POL: Where are they?
ARCHER: Take us out of a war between Andorians and Tellarites. Set to hit anything, just keep them off. That isn't it?
T'POL: He deserves to be preoccupied with trivial matters. Ensign Sato's translation says that
ARCHER: I thought you said.
(Trip supervises Muk and Grish putting the torpedoes back in the Armoury where they belong.)
[Alien cargo bay]
(Archer releases Porthos from the box and gives him a big cuddle.)
ARCHER: Would you mind bringing me here?
[Alien ship]
ARCHER: You're not going to need our comm. frequencies on the other eleven prisoners are under guard at all times. If I'm Captain Archer of the management. I'd bust your ass back to the Vulcans. Why not prove them wrong?
KREM: Oh, not there. Over here.
(The other three are tied up.)
ARCHER: The Vulcan Science Officer doesn't make it in the Federation. That could be shield emitters.
MUK: La ruvah tahp!
ULIS: No. We'll find it, Muk. Be patient. Open it.
KREM: Makes me sneeze.
ULIS: Rule of Acquisition number twenty three. Nothing is more important than your health, except for your money.
KREM: How do I know you won't sell her. Not right away.
(T'Pol walks away, Archer right behind her.)
ULIS: Add it to the pot.
KREM: My cousin's a skillful merchant. I don't have the lobes for business. You'd better slide that over to make room for the others.
ULIS: Ingala duk habi?
(Krem settles into the Captain's chair.)
KREM: Vulcan.
ULIS: Twenty percent. Final offer.
GRISH: The vault?
ULIS: Wait here. Let's get to their Captain's quarters.
MUK: Ulis tenda vool.
(Krem takes hold of the flight controls, the little ship undocks and flies away without us ever learning the name of their race.)
