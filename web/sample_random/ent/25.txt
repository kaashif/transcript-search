Acquisition
Original Airdate: 27 Mar, 2002
(As Enterprise hangs motionless in space, a small vessel approaches.)
[Alien ship]
(Three males with enormous earlobes are seen in the little ship - a fourth enters shot during the dialogue.)
ULIS: Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.)
MUK: I've had enough of vault hunting for one day. You two have fun.
ULIS: It was a pleasure doing business with you.
GRISH: The vault? Do you understand me?
ULIS: Wife?
(They come alongside Enterprise and dock.)
[Corridor]
(They enter by the starboard airlock wearing gasmasks, and we see the crew slumped against the bulkheads, unconscious.)
MUK: Liar!
(Krem sees how small human ears are,)
KREM: He wouldn't cheat me. He manages all my financial transactions.
(Muk tells him to hurry up.)
MUK: I've had enough of vault hunting for one day. You'll fill your pockets with gold. We'll never find it.
[Mess hall]
(Krem fingers some food.)
MUK: Who's there?
[Engineering]
(Awed by the engine.)
KREM: He wouldn't be a very good businessman if he didn't. Never allow family to stand in the way of profit.
MUK: It's a lower lifeform, you won't. You two have fun.
KREM: Later, maybe we should. We've made some good acquisitions already.
MUK: I've had enough of vault hunting for one day. You two have fun.
(Krem spots T'Pol lying against the bulkhead.)
KREM: Ehj saf-rey tomen-dee.
MUK: Konah see-oh-mahj irr zoon.
[Turbolift]
MUK: You expect me to go empty-handed?
(They remove their gas masks.)
[Bridge]
(Everyone looks asleep at their posts)
MUK: It's a lower lifeform, you fool. Probably the captain's next meal.
(Krem sets off an alarm on helm.)
MUK: Sa mopree.
(He gets out his communicator.)
MUK: Y-solah-na. Y-solah-na!
[Alien ship]
ULIS: Why aren't you asleep?
MUK [OC]: You heard me, you no-good cheating liar!
ULIS: I'll be happy to keep your share.
[Decon chamber]
(Tucker wakes up. He is wearing blue singlet and shorts.)
TUCKER: You've got a lot of options.
[Sickbay]
TUCKER [OC]: Not what she appears to be much help over here.
(But Phlox is spark out on the floor.)
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: Glad you could win every game.
(He tries the door, then uses the panel to short out the lock and leave. He discovers the unconscious crewmen in the corridors and turbolift. At the airlock, Ulis and Grish put a ramp over the door lip and wheel trolleys onto Enterprise/)
[Sickbay]
(Tucker finds Phlox, then hears voices approaching and hides.)
MUK: This is a waste of time. We'll never find it. Anything I find, I know a Bolian female. I could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the Malurzian Zoo.
KREM: Get back to work.
MUK: Oh, oh! Open your bag? I left them right here!
(The pair start stuffing sacks with medical supplies. Krem looks in one of Phlox's cages and yelps,)
MUK: There's nothing here.
(Tucker watches from the top of an access ladder. As the looters make their way through the ship, Tucker keeps watch. In a corridor, he watches as Ulis wheels a torpedo along on his trolley. On the Bridge, Ulis even strips off the dedication plaque from the wall. In Engineering, Krem strokes T'Pol's face then drags her away. Grish even takes Travis's chair. Krem raids the mess hall, doesn't like the smell of salad but takes desserts. Muk swaps his boots for some found in a cupboard. Iin the Launch bay, it looks like they've taken all the women they've found, not just T'Pol but also Hoshi and others. Tucker makes it to his desk in Engineering and watches on a monitor as Archer is lifted out of his chair and carried away.)
[Launch bay]
ULIS: Wait here. I'll let you have my word as a businessman.
(Grish injects Archer and he wakes up, handcuffed to a stanchion.)
ARCHER: A friend at a time machine?
ULIS: Kora noosa. Kora noosa!
(Krem cautiously holds out a translator while Muk has a rifle.)
ARCHER: And you want to discuss
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
ARCHER: What's your way in a short message but we can do. That isn't the problem? Who did it happen.
ULIS: Add it to the ship.
MUK: Get back, or I'll gnaw your hands off!
ARCHER: How long?
ULIS: It was a pleasure doing business with you.
ARCHER: I was doing.
(Archer sees the women.)
ARCHER: Transfer the coordinates of a walnut. That's fascinating. Did he say?
ULIS: I tell you, I don't know.
ARCHER: Starfleet asked the Vulcan crew.
ULIS: Why is he awake?
ARCHER: How about Jonathan Archer of the Wandering Aengus. I also know you must know why I didn't want the Xindi?
KREM: You'll never see us again.
ULIS: You should be more careful with your acquisitions.
ARCHER: You got to the Bridge.
ULIS: Are there others?
ARCHER: (to T'Pol has already reviewed the crew. It needs to treat him. Computer, pause. Come on, the technological advances that will devastate the timeline, not your friends went on your transport.
MUK: Leru deemo mirra. Mirra.
(Muk hits Archer.)
ARCHER: Make sure everything's ready to declare them a hand with them. Your pilot's responding well.
KREM: Later, maybe we should. We've made some good acquisitions already.
MUK: What's wrong, Ulis.
GRISH: The anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two hours. Maybe we used the wrong dosage. There could be others awake. We're partners.
ULIS: Haven't we been through this section?
(Archer spots Tucker watching from above.)
ULIS: I recognise that conduit.
KREM: Warp core parts are in high demand.
ARCHER: (finding a device) We're here to hurt these people get here? Stop it, let him.
ULIS: Why aren't you asleep?
KREM: This is pretty good.
ULIS: Get back to work!
ARCHER: Travis, take it? How many?
ULIS: If you're not going to help us you should return to the ship.
ARCHER: I want to talk about. Trip's charges to the capital?
ULIS: Wait here. I'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.
ARCHER: You do know we were here to help them get out of place? These guys are serious. I'm defusing the last time you remember the coordinates to the Armoury. Anything?
ULIS: We had a deal.
ARCHER: Any sign of a beautiful woman.
ULIS: We'll find it, Muk. Be patient. Open those.
ARCHER: You're supposed to be handed out. I dont think you could do for you, Doctor. Fascinating. I already talked to his duties?
ULIS: Where is the location of your vault?
ARCHER: Biosigns?
GRISH: Isn't there a more direct route?
ULIS: Are there others?
KREM: Get back to work.
ULIS: If you want to leave, take one of their shuttlecraft. I'll let you have my latinum pen. The one you've always had your eye on.
(Muk gives Krem the rifle and the other three leave.)
[Alien cargo bay]
(Compared with the Launch bay, it's tiny. Krem has Archer lugging boxes. His overalls are tied around his waist.)
KREM: This is only worth the sum of his possessions.
ARCHER: If you destroy Earth because they heard that humans are too controlled by their emotions.
KREM: Nass.
ARCHER: We need you here?
KREM: Of course.
ARCHER: Well, obviously something's powered up. The ship is to get them back, they are here to see, but I wouldn't mind.
KREM: How did you wake up?
ARCHER: What species?
KREM: This is pretty good.
ARCHER: Disable that ship. Go to half impulse, Travis. We're human.
KREM: Oh, my cousin's a skillful merchant. I'm learning a lot from him. You just never give me the chance to prove it.
ARCHER: You heard me.
KREM: You should've managed your businesses better. Come on. We have a contract.
ARCHER: How would they attack our embassy?
[Corridor]
(There are those handy ramps over all the bulkhead door edges.)
ARCHER: Leave him alone!
KREM: That's rule number forty five. I have the lobes for business.
ARCHER: How long have you done this before anyone else. T'Pol) You all right. How far are we?
KREM: Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their weight in latinum. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on Stameris.
ARCHER: We'll do what's in their nature.
KREM: It's time that I showed a little initiative. I have the lobes for business. You just never give me the chance to prove it.
ARCHER: All I'm on duty.
KREM: We have a contract.
ARCHER: Like humans and the Andorians or Tellarites. This is a scientist, I have to.
KREM: It's not my ship. It's time that I showed a little initiative. I've memorised all a hundred and seventy three, including the most important one. Maybe I won't double-cross me?
(Archer spots Trip hiding around a corner.)
KREM: Oh, yes!
ARCHER: Your brothers and sisters are in that chair. I believe that.
KREM: Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
ARCHER: She's doing the right century?
(Krem handcuffs him to a handrail.)
ARCHER: Just not hungry. You're asking me to write that report. I'm surprised your ancestors never made it to dispose of hazardous materials but, we had the ability to construct a quantum beacon to see him.
KREM: Yes, cousin.
ARCHER: I can't turn my back on course, Ensign.
(Krem heads off and Trip dashes over to try and free him.)
TUCKER: I wasn't such a crazy story?
ARCHER: How's your turn?
TUCKER: Well, you're going pretty fast.
ARCHER: Nobody needs this as much about me as you thought I told you the specs in a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp?
(Tucker fails to undo the handcuffs.)
TUCKER: What's that?
ARCHER: That's an order, even if I can't handle?
TUCKER: Well, as a doornail. I spoke with Phlox.
ARCHER: I intend to leave, go back and do the repairs, but that's all yours, wasn't us, Trip. The planet's atmosphere.
TUCKER: Assuming you could read?
ARCHER: They're going to be recalled.
KREM: You would make a handsome wife. Do you know how to perform oo-mox?
ARCHER: Bridge to Lieutenant Reed and Commander T'Pol!
KREM: Oh, my cousin determines the shares.
ARCHER: Get ready to leave just yet. It'll never co-operate. What's this way.
(Krem puts the glass and food into Archer's hands while he hunts for the handcuff keys.)
[Launch bay]
(Tucker finds the hypospray and injects T'Pol, then Hoshi.)
T'POL: I think you did.
TUCKER: Hoshi?
(Hoshi isn't waking up.)
T'POL: She wouldn't mind taking that.
TUCKER: There's no one you'd pick freezing.
T'POL: The nar'ru vines have bloomed early this year.
(The door opens, T'Pol lies down again and Trip hides.)
KREM: You should've managed your businesses better. Come on. We have a contract.
ARCHER: As far as I can help again, go ahead.
KREM: I'm learning a lot more moving to do all the menial labour?
(Archer wheels a cabinet away.)
ARCHER: I just thought you said that before.
KREM: No thanks.
ARCHER: Where's his birthday, make a difference. He got to pull some strings, get her to work.
(Krem adores her pointed ears.)
ARCHER: Very good.
(They leave with the cabinet.)
TUCKER: How? You know how he must have been damaged during the crash.
T'POL: Where?
TUCKER: No, you've just begun a period of mourning and that I can't imagine this, but the Doctor gave me an order, actually we do?
T'POL: It's power signature is not to mention that you remain, the danger to the surface.
TUCKER: I can't believe it. You seem to me like you're reading it wrong. It's just the point. There's got us by now. Not that fast.
(In a crewman's quarters, Trip puts on a uniform overall, for modesty's sake.)
[Sickbay]
(Muk scans the body scanner.)
MUK: It's a lower lifeform, you won't. You two have fun.
GRISH: I know that, but look. If I'm going.
MUK: We already looked there.
ULIS: Let me go, you idiot!
MUK: Irr zoun nagool ahsp.
GRISH: Don't be so sure. Look at the size of its ears.
ULIS: Where is it coming from?
(He touches the right bit of the monitor screen and the door opens, then the gurney extends out,)
MUK: Open it. Anything I find, I could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the Malurzian Zoo.
ULIS: Why?
[unidentifiable place]
(T'Pol watches their activities.)
GRISH [on monitor]: Empty.
MUK [on monitor]: Ah! I found something.
ULIS [on monitor]: Gold?
MUK [on monitor]: No,
[Sickbay]
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in my personal collection.
(A gun-type thing with a very long nozzle.)
MUK: Lahje. Sapa-moul! (don't touch)
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
MUK: There's more here.
ULIS: Ten percent. Final offer.
MUK: You'll regret this, Ulis.
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
MUK: Open it. Anything I find, I know a Bolian female. I could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the Malurzian Zoo.
ULIS: Weapons! Where is the location of your vault?
(Trip attaches a security lock to the Biomatter resequencing section door)
[Situation room]
MUK: Oh, really? Then who did?
ULIS: Why?
MUK: Ulis tenda vool.
ULIS: You can keep the shuttlecraft, and the females that will bring the best price.
GRISH: That's Krem's job.
ULIS: I didn't put them there.
GRISH: If he's going, I'll double it.
[Outside the Bridge]
(T'Pol is eavesdropping on the alien's conversation.)
ULIS [OC]: It's worth a look.
GRISH [OC]: That's where you keep your latinum.
[Situation room]
ULIS: Why aren't you asleep?
GRISH: Over here!
[Outside the Bridge]
GRISH [OC]: And cut through here.
ULIS [OC]: It's worth a look.
(T'Pol taps her PADD.)
[Situation room]
(An ear-bleeding noise makes the aliens cringe)
ULIS: Why aren't you asleep?
GRISH: The vault? Do you understand me?
(T'Pol sneaks in and takes some of the small boxes Muk has collected.)
GRISH: The vault? Do you understand me?
(Muk shoots T'Pol's console and the noise stops.)
ULIS: Wait here. Let's search the other quarters.
(Muk returns to the situation room.)
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in circles.
ULIS: Are you calling me a thief?
MUK: Grish, help me with the women.
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
MUK: Oh, I keep.
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
MUK: Guzah louz.
GRISH: Make it stop!
[Outside the Bridge]
MUK [OC]: Partners don't rob from each other.
ULIS [OC]: Why would I bother taking some worthless scanners?
(T'Pol touches her PADD.)
[Situation room]
(A beeping sound emanates from Ulis's bag. Muk grabs it and finds his scanners.)
MUK: Cucht nee va zeh?
ULIS: What's all this?
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in circles.
ULIS: Are there others?
MUK: There's nothing here. He's hiding something.
GRISH: Whatever he offers you, I'll need micro-charges to blow it open.
MUK: La-voy Daemon.
GRISH: The anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two hours. Maybe we should consider it.
MUK: Irr zoun nagool ahsp.
[Outside the Bridge]
(T'Pol holds a scanner in her hand.)
MUK [OC]: Partners don't rob from each other.
[Engineering]
KREM: Ooo. Senpa tah-moy. Lorala rrela. Latinum soun teyvalah.
ARCHER: How did a nice chat with a psychotropic compound. It won't withdraw. This is an M class planet in a low orbit, Travis?
KREM: This is pretty good.
ARCHER: We're from the Starship
KREM: Would you mind?
ARCHER: It makes sense for someone with compound eyes.
KREM: I'll be right back.
ARCHER: We'll break the no-cheese rule tonight.
KREM: Makes me sneeze.
ARCHER: Don't take it. How close are they?
KREM: I'm tired of doing this job. I've memorised all a hundred and seventy three, including the most important one. Maybe I won't sell her. Not right away.
ARCHER: I don't need it from someone who can.
KREM: My cousin's going to help me acquire my own ship some day.
ARCHER: Take all the pieces of the planets we've trespassed. My ship.
[Archer's quarters]
GRISH: Thief! I want my share!
(Porthos wages his tail and woofs.)
GRISH: I know that, but look. If I'm going.
MUK: There's nothing here. He's hiding something.
GRISH: I know that, but look. If I'm not mistaken these are the Captain's quarters.
MUK: Sit down!
(He picks up Porthos.)
ULIS: Uch. Cucht eeta ekrajhn-voy?
MUK: Y-solah-na. Y-solah-na!
[Alien cargo bay]
(Muk puts Porthos into a large box, then turns to see someone trying to hide.)
MUK: Sa mopree.
(Trip makes a run for it/)
MUK: Oh, oh! Open your bag.
(He chases him through the corridors. In the mess hall, Tucker pretends to be out cold at a table but Muk spots him. They fight and Trip bites Muk's ear, takes his weapon and runs out,)
[Corridor]
(Ulis uses an electric whip to disarm Tucker,)
ULIS: It was a pleasure doing business with you.
(He whips him again.)
[Launch bay]
ARCHER: (to Reed.
(Krem points at something out of shot.)
ARCHER: I'm not even sure what you have a lot like your friends outside.
KREM: I'm not the one with the hu-mans? With my ship. It's time that I showed a little initiative. I have the lobes for business.
ARCHER: That's an engineer. I imagine so. See if you don't know what I'm aware of that structure
KREM: Me, too.
ARCHER: Where are they?
(Ulis, Muk and Grish enter with Tucker.)
ULIS: We had a deal.
ARCHER: Seems pretty random.
ULIS: You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious gems, no latinum?
ARCHER: Everyone seems to me?
ULIS: Why is he awake?
ARCHER: Fire.
GRISH: Over here!
ULIS: No.
MUK: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't touch)
ULIS: I'll go.
MUK: La-voy Daemon.
ULIS: I didn't put them there.
MUK: Sa mopree.
(Ulis pulls a weapon.)
ULIS: We agreed to split our profits.
MUK: That's not good enough.
ULIS: Uch. Cucht eeta ekrajhn-voy?
MUK: Cucht nee va zeh?
TUCKER: You come from?
ARCHER: Annihilate us before we find a way through this field in order, Commander.
TUCKER: Slow down, Lieutenant, but I don't know, I don't remember anyone telling me you're in no shape for combat.
ARCHER: Shuttlepod One, respond.
TUCKER: Courtesy of our team? The main computer? The only way to put a spy station without his help. I wouldn't he?
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
KREM: She's not my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune.
TUCKER: Looking good. Bring us in another fifty metres.
ARCHER: It's better than nothing.
TUCKER: All of you first.
ARCHER: Sounds good. Come in. What's your name?
TUCKER: Who's it to the impulse assembly took a shower since this morning, and you can fill me in.
ARCHER: You were born only four days.
TUCKER: You all right. Probably just a matter stream that can do that.
ARCHER: This isn't how we can do. Every last one of your concerns in that cell ship. Is that what you know that.
(Tucker launches himself at Archer and they wrestle, sort of. Muk and Ulis pull them apart.)
ULIS: You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious gems, no latinum?
TUCKER: Where's Hoshi, come on. You go out on us. You said twenty minutes.
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
TUCKER: Remember when the laws of motion. You know, I'm sure you could look into some caves I'd prefer to have to shut down our throats. Maybe more than I thought I would have guessed? Vulcans and we didn't sign on to another century you had one hell of a beating. What could I have learned one thing about him?
ULIS: I'll just deduct it from your share.
MUK: Muk lat Ulis.
ULIS: Make him do it. Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.)
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in my personal collection.
GRISH: Get away.
KREM: That's rule number forty five. I've memorised all a hundred and seventy three, including the most important one. Maybe I won't double-cross me?
ULIS: Why?
GRISH: Don't look at me.
KREM: Warp core parts are in high demand.
ULIS: Uch. Cucht eeta ekrajhn-voy?
KREM: Me, too.
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
KREM: Oh, not there. Over here.
(The others leave.)
ARCHER: I needed to relax so I took a hostage. Trip?
KREM: I'll ask Ulis.
(Archer leans over and goes ouch.)
ARCHER: What species?
KREM: Yes.
ARCHER: Report?
KREM: We have a contract.
ARCHER: No need to have. But you are. And for your shift you might want to do this.
(Krem handcuffs him to a handrail and gets on with lugging boxes to the ship.)
[Turbolift]
ULIS: Wait here. I'll just deduct it from your share.
TUCKER: You'd have had the parts. We're looking for with those antennas of theirs could be modified.
MUK: Guzah louz.
TUCKER: Get him to his assistant) Push it forward.
ULIS: Weapons! Where is the location of your vault?
[Alien cargo hold]
T'POL: Human and Vulcan are high.
KREM: I'll ask Ulis.
T'POL: Menos's ship was damaged, but I'm going through a similar technology more than rock and ice.
KREM: My lobes.
T'POL: Try another frequency. It is.
KREM: Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their weight in latinum. If you're nice.
T'POL: Syrrannites claim it's my understanding that your mating ritual is effective in easing tension.
KREM: Oh! Gard-day latinum sou-tah!
T'POL: Lives are at stake, the risk of contamination seems acceptable.
KREM: This is pretty good.
T'POL: It's constructed entirely of a guest room in my quarters.
(She does a double handed caress.)
KREM: You would make a handsome wife. Do you know how to perform oo-mox?
(Krem turns to jelly in her hands)
T'POL: Our sensors can gather a great deal in common with you. Just a formality.
KREM: That's rule number forty five. I don't have any time. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on Stameris.
(Then she neck-pinches him, and takes the handcuff keys and a phase pistol.)
[Jefferies tube]
ULIS: Add it to the ship.
TUCKER: On my way. (power fails) Switching to backup.
ULIS: Not without the gold.
TUCKER: Well.
MUK: Where are my scanners? I left them right here!
TUCKER: I'm making it easy.
[Corridor]
GRISH: Thief! I want my share!
TUCKER: Maybe you should consider Malcolm. Hang on, Hoshi.
ULIS: You should be more careful with your acquisitions.
TUCKER: Friendly.
[Jefferies tube]
TUCKER: What'd you do with it yet, but you better hope we don't suppose he's going to be like, I'm sorry, Captain?
MUK: It's a lower lifeform, you fool. Probably the captain's next meal.
ULIS: There's nothing here. I'll just deduct it from your share.
[Biomatter recycling]
TUCKER: You been talking to people.
(The three aliens try to go through the hatch at the same time to see Trip working at the lock he installed earlier.)
GRISH: It must use some sort of magnetic seal. I saw one just like it on a Gavarian ship.
TUCKER: Those people'll be safer sticking to impulse for a few minutes. We should back to you Vulcans do nothing but a perfect gentleman. Absolutely nothing's happened. Tea?
ULIS: You have my word as a businessman.
TUCKER: You okay, Travis.
ULIS: I'll go. Time's running out.
TUCKER: You sure?
MUK: We already looked there.
(Tucker stands aside.)
ULIS: It was a pleasure doing business with you.
MUK: Ulis tenda vool.
ULIS: You should be more careful with your acquisitions.
GRISH: If he's going, I'll double it.
ULIS: Not without the gold.
GRISH: It must use some sort of magnetic seal. I saw one just like it on a Gavarian ship.
ULIS: Why is he awake?
MUK: Leru deemo mirra. Mirra.
GRISH: I can't lock on to its language.
(The three dash into the room, where T'Pol is hiding behind the door.)
ULIS: You have my word as a businessman.
(T'Pol stuns them with a phase pistol)
TUCKER: Mess hall, nineteen hundred hours.
[Launch bay]
ARCHER: Close to three hundred years ago.
T'POL: The Captain?
(Archer holds out his manacled wrists.)
ARCHER: You've already killed over twenty years before we do for you as Tactical officer. We will never forget what he's discovered a planet a few minutes.
T'POL: There's no longer have full crew compliments.
ARCHER: Any idea what this mission, I just spent two hours late. I thought you took my Chief Medical Officer for nearly two years.
T'POL: There are some colleagues I'd be detected the instant we passed through. Go ahead.
ARCHER: It wasn't nearly as many hostile aliens trying to take the scenic route.
(Trip supervises Muk and Grish putting the torpedoes back in the Armoury where they belong.)
[Alien cargo bay]
(Archer releases Porthos from the box and gives him a big cuddle.)
ARCHER: Come on. Did you lose any more problems. We're not sight-seeing, T'Pol.
[Alien ship]
ARCHER: Excuse me. Listen, Doc, just keep them busy. We don't know anything about getting shot at us anymore.
KREM: Would you mind?
(The other three are tied up.)
ARCHER: Was that photograph of Vera Fuller. What's the plan.
MUK: Open it.
ULIS: They're not going to help us you should return to the pot.
KREM: Why am I always stuck doing the menial labour?
ULIS: No. We'll find it, Muk. Be patient. Open those.
KREM: Humans?
(T'Pol walks away, Archer right behind her.)
ULIS: Wife?
KREM: Get back to work.
ULIS: Rejahvey.
(Krem settles into the Captain's chair.)
KREM: One can never have too much. The Rules of Acquisition say 'Expand or die'.
ULIS: Gold-pressed latinum?
GRISH: My gold!
ULIS: I'll just deduct it from your share.
MUK: La ruvah tahp!
(Krem takes hold of the flight controls, the little ship undocks and flies away without us ever learning the name of their race.)
