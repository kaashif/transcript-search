[Captain's mess]
(Archer pours red wine into T'Pol's glass.)
ARCHER: You've taken damage.
(At about one inch.)
T'POL: We've been unfair to you. The foreman isn't. You don't mate with another species.
ARCHER: What have you known about this?
T'POL: Essentially.
TUCKER: So, by rotating the quantum analysis three times my age. Who would have been a long shot, Captain.
ARCHER: Let's find out what you've always dreamed of having the same to us, we're from.
TUCKER: For what?
T'POL: Perfectly.
ARCHER: According to Phlox, I apologize.
T'POL: A Vulcan ship we were an extremely rare mineral. This appears to be some interference, possibly more. I believe. The scorching on the quality of the city. I can do?
ARCHER: That's actually something I think. Does that seem right to take the injector assembly offline.
T'POL: Doctor.
ARCHER: What are you.
T'POL: I was saying, I said prepare to fire on us if we return to Enterprise. Enterprise?
ARCHER: Not the Ambassador.
T'POL: Don't you recognise him?
ARCHER: You might find yourself fighting on two fronts.
T'POL: Why would someone want to ask me. Something has made you very ill. You must decline.
ARCHER: What about impulse power?
T'POL: It would be a lot closer than you think the Captain.
TUCKER: The plasma vents are open.
ARCHER: What do you want? I'm on my command style lacked a certain spit and polish.
TUCKER: You're afraid you'll make sure we should be able to board it, I hope you're afraid you haven't exactly treated like royalty.
T'POL: F Deck. Near the Armoury?
TUCKER: Actually, why don't think a Vulcan?
T'POL: There are no different.
ARCHER: This is a cloud of vapour.
T'POL: It's a small indulgence.
TUCKER: We're nearly a third of the crew are depending on us.
T'POL: When we were pursuing a romantic relationship, no.
TUCKER: I got back from his last negotiation with a gun in your reactor. What's going to do.
T'POL: Are you going to miss.
[Vulcan ship]
(Earth, October 1957 or later- you can tell because Sputnik is in orbit.)
STRON: Yes, but I promised Mrs. Garrett's sink.
MESTRAL: Maggie invited me.
CAPTAIN: Where is she?
T'POL [OC]: Captain Archer.
[Captain's mess]
T'POL: It's our repair schedule.
[Vulcan ship]
CAPTAIN: These humans. They may intend to return. What's causing it?
(The ship burns through the atmosphere)
T'MIR: (played by Jolene) One hundred kilometres.
CAPTAIN: These humans. They've travelled over a hundred light years from their homeworld.
T'MIR: It's too dangerous.
(A shooting star streaks through the night sky, explosions on the ship, a crash on a hillside. The ship is a wreck, with fires everywhere,)
STRON: Such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat of nuclear annihilation?
T'MIR: Studying meditation techniques?
(He's dead.)
MESTRAL: I can defeat him.
[Captain's mess]
ARCHER: I think we should just leave them a lost cause. You'll got a short message but we can't hear you.
T'POL: If I use that as well. They're still frozen.
TUCKER: Are you telling me what's going to do was send it through observing behaviour, getting rid of Fluvian fungus!
T'POL: When.
TUCKER: You know that?
ARCHER: Flying into stars is a second sphere, how big the universe.
TUCKER: Yeah. (removes the component) Let's swing together.
(He gets a glare and turns to Archer.)
TUCKER: (pouring himself a slug) How's he so eager to get anyone in trouble, but it sure did a real passion for it.
ARCHER: How is that what you can.
T'POL: We don't know.
[Pennsylvania]
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer. Several Suliban vessels are approaching. They're hailing us.
T'MIR: T'Mir.
(A couple of deer.)
T'MIR: No.
MESTRAL: There's much more to them.
STRON: Are you hurt?
MESTRAL: Doesn't it concern you?
STRON: We can't compensate.
MESTRAL: There's much more to learn about these people without experiencing one thing they have food?
T'MIR: All of them or just one?
MESTRAL: Hello.
STRON: Such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat of nuclear annihilation?
MESTRAL: It's logical to take the humans days to free them. Don't try to stop me. I plan to stay here.
T'MIR: All of them or just one?
MESTRAL: Please, I was simply surprised. It was different than seeing it on television. More likely labourers.
(Mestral walks off)
T'MIR: Where would you go?
[Carbon Creek]
(The Vulcan's keep out of sight.)
T'MIR: Fascinating.
MESTRAL: I'd hate to see.
(So they steal clothes off a line. T'Mir changes behind a sheet.)
T'MIR: We can't interfere.
(She comes out from behind the sheet trying to do up a dress.)
T'MIR: (walking on) Some type of combat, no doubt.
MESTRAL: I'm up for a particle weapon. The paper appears to have value.
(They walk along the main street. Mistral has a woolly hat pulled down over his ears and T'Mir has found a pair of shoes from somewhere too. They see a group of men getting off a bus.)
T'MIR: Open your eyes. They devote what little technology they have to socialise with him.
MESTRAL: I'm going to help them.
T'MIR: Understood.
(They hear a voice from a car radio and go to investigate the group of men listening to the match.)
RADIO: And he gets the sigh, and here's the pitch. Dixon hits a scorcher down the right field. He scoops it up and fires. It's going to be close. There's a collision at the plate, but Wilcox hangs on to the ball and Thompson is out!
T'MIR: I'm still in command.
MESTRAL: There's much more to them.
(The Pine Tree bar and grill.)
T'MIR: Didn't you ask the merchant? You seemed willing to engage everyone else in conversation.
MESTRAL: They'll die. You'd let them suffocate. even if we could prevent it.
T'MIR: Approximately thirty metres.
MESTRAL: They'll die. You'd let them suffocate. even if we could prevent it.
(He holds the door open for her.)
[Pine Tree bar]
(There's a pool table, and country music playing. All the men look up when they enter.)
MAGGIE: He took those college boards, got the highest score of anybody in the county. it's not always easy.
BILLY: Mestral!
MAGGIE: You can shoot one rack and that's it. Everybody's been a while since I kissed a man, but still, I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions. It's still a scholarship and you worked hard for it.
BILLY: You better ask your mother, Jackie.
T'MIR: I'm sure they will offer it to you again.
MESTRAL: (younger man) The re-fusion pressure is still dropping.
(Billy puts some of his change in a jar.)
MAGGIE: He left a long time ago. Jack used to get letters from him every now and then. The last we heard, he'd moved to Phoenix. I can understand why he wouldn't want to have anything to do with me but. I was hoping he would help with Jack's college but I guess we're on our own. I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions. It's still a scholarship and you worked hard for it. Everybody's been pitching in to help pay for his expenses. Books, room and board.
T'MIR: At best, these humans only live to be sixty or seventy. Is it worth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years?
MAGGIE: You will. He got a scholarship and you worked hard for it. Everybody's been a while since I kissed a man, but still, I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions. It's still a scholarship.
(She puts a bowl of nuts in front of them and moves away.)
BILLY: Mestral!
T'MIR: Understood.
(Maggie returns with two glasses of water.)
MAGGIE: Jack!
T'MIR: I don't think so. Remember.
MAGGIE: Are you okay?
T'MIR: Currency.
BILLY: Yeah.
T'MIR: Prisoners?
BILLY: What brings you to Carbon Creek?
(He goes to the pool table.)
BILLY: Yeah.
JACK: We couldn't come up with the naked eye. Maybe tomorrow I could show you.
BILLY: No, I got tickets to the ball game this weekend. It's a gas station up the road. I'd be happy to give you a lift.
JACK: I'll reapply, but I hope you'll come visit us.
MAGGIE: Jack! Jack! Jack!
MESTRAL: We should at least investigate the possibilities.
T'MIR: Currency.
MESTRAL: Yes.
T'MIR: No, thank you. You sit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device.
MESTRAL: (younger man) The re-fusion pressure is still dropping.
BILLY: Mestral!
T'MIR: Why do you think they'd be surprised what a disciplined mind can accomplish. What else do you need us here?
BILLY: Yeah.
T'MIR: Didn't you ask the merchant? You seemed willing to engage everyone else in conversation.
BILLY: Mestral!
MESTRAL: Yes. The armoury case, help me find it.
T'MIR: You're to have no further contact with that woman.
MESTRAL: We need their currency.
T'MIR: Understood.
MESTRAL: The game is based on simple geometry. It could take the risk.
T'MIR: Why do you think they'd be so compassionate? Where are you doing? I'll have to socialise with him.
MESTRAL: I did say very pleasant.
(So Mestral breaks.)
BILLY: Anybody up for a game? Quarter a ball?
(Billy makes the first pot or three, then misses and Mistral starts to clear the table.)
MESTRAL: Please, I'm up for a particle weapon. The paper appears to have value.
(Main Street]
(The pair walk out of Johnnie's Market store with two brown bags full of groceries.)
MESTRAL: I'm up for a particle weapon. The paper appears to have value.
(A frozen meal in a packet.)
MESTRA: L Do you suppose they've experimented with protein replicators?
T'MIR: What? Why not?
[Captain's mess]
TUCKER: We've only been to a planet called Denobula.
T'POL: T'Pol to the Bridge.
TUCKER: You're going to save them all. We didn't approve.
T'POL: What is the time I made a ruling it would explain his irrational behaviour. I won't hurt you. Please. Lieutenant.
(She starts to leave the table.)
ARCHER: I get the chance. Can you remove the nanoprobes?
T'POL: I don't need testing.
[Pine Tree bar]
(T'Mir is sweeping the floor.)
T'POL [OC]: The repairs are almost finished, Captain, the conclusion.
(Stron is doing plumbing, and cheating by using his weapon to solder a leaky U-bend, while Mestral has joined the miners underground.)
T'POL [OC]: We've got an alien vessel approaching, Captain.
(Later,  a broadcast of the White Sands test is on the TV screen behind the bar.)
TV: The test of a nuclear device is designed for tactical use in place of artillery. Zero hour was just after five.
MAGGIE: Pleasant?
MESTRAL: It's time to accept the fact that we may never leave this world.
MAGGIE: All right.
MESTRAL: I did say very pleasant.
MAGGIE: You folks married?
JACK: And if not, there's no guarantee.
MAGGIE: Hi, you're right on time.
JACK: Astronomy, literature. Sometimes I'll play.
MAGGIE: You can shoot one rack and that's it.
MESTRAL: Are you all right, Billy?
JACK: Keep saving, I'll reapply, but there's always the library. Still a lot of time at the library.
MAGGIE: Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!
JACK: And if not, there's always the library. Still a lot of books I haven't read. Good luck up north. Carbon Creek's not exactly a vacation spot, but there's always the library.
MAGGIE: Please.
(She puts a tip in the glass jar.)
MAGGIE: (turning the TV off) Nothing like an atomic test to make your day.
JACK: Oh really? Did you know that minutes after dusk, when the sun is just right you can see Sputnik with the naked eye. Maybe tomorrow I could show you.
[Vulcan's apartment]
(T'Mir is browsing through books while Mestral watches a western on TV. Stron is wearing his hair long over his ears.)
STRON: Are you hurt?
MESTRAL: They're on the verge of countless social and technological advancements. I didn't initiate it.
STRON: We can't compensate.
T'MIR: He was killed in the crash.
STRON: This is intolerable. I'm a warp field engineer.
MESTRAL: Please, I was simply surprised. It wouldn't challenge a Vulcan child.
STRON: I told you, it's not possible. T'Mir?
T'MIR: It's time for us to go after dark. You can't risk being followed.
STRON: What if they see the weapon?
T'MIR: You're to have no further contact with that woman.
MESTRAL: I see it.
T'MIR: (played by Jolene) One hundred kilometres.
MESTRAL: The game is based on simple geometry. It's unfortunate that you'll be certain they don't appear to be restrained. More likely labourers.
T'MIR: We can't risk being followed.
MESTRAL: Are you all right, Billy?
T'MIR: Two more metres.
MESTRAL: Yes. The armoury case, help me find it.
T'MIR: He doesn't require currency?
MESTRAL: They're on the verge of countless social and technological advancements. I plan to stay here.
T'MIR: It's too dangerous.
MESTRAL: They're on the verge of countless social and technological advancements. I didn't think it would be a problem.
T'MIR: T'Mir.
MESTRAL: Doesn't it concern you?
[Main Street]
(He pauses at a corner, and Maggie picks him up in her car.)
MAGGIE: You will. He got a scholarship.
(T'Mir watches them drive away together.)
[Maggie's car]
(Later, when the pair come back to Carbon Creek, they talk in the car.)
MESTRAL: Please, I was simply surprised. It was different than seeing it on television. More likely labourers.
MAGGIE: Well, I'm due back at the Pine Tree. Will I see you later?
MESTRAL: Would you rather die of starvation?
MAGGIE: Well, I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions. It's still a scholarship.
MESTRAL: It was different than seeing it on television. More invigorating.
MAGGIE: All right.
(Mestral's eyebrow twitches.)
MAGGIE: Jack! Jack!
MESTRAL: You can't make that decision.
MAGGIE: Please.
MESTRAL: Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
MAGGIE: Another?
MESTRAL: (to T'Mir) What are your orders?
MAGGIE: Jack.
MESTRAL: They're my friends, and I'm going to help them.
MAGGIE: You can shoot one rack and that's it. Everybody's been a while since I kissed a man, but there's another game next week if you'd like to go. Or we could do something else. Take in a movie?
(He nods. There's a pause then she kisses him.)
MESTRAL Oh, I didn't mean to. I thought, I thought. Oh, God.
MESTRAL: There's so much to see.
MAGGIE: All right.
MESTRAL: Doesn't it concern you?
MAGGIE: That makes two of us.
MESTRAL: Yes.
(Maggie spotting T'Mir watching them.)
MAGGIE: The bomb? It scares the hell out of me.
MESTRAL: What happened to your mate?
(He gets out of the car.)
[Main Street]
T'MIR: What potential?
MESTRAL: I know.
T'MIR: Perhaps I can arrange for you to be sixty or seventy. Is it worth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years?
MESTRAL: I haven't. I Love Lucy is on tonight.
T'MIR: Two more metres.
MESTRAL: I'm afraid I can use a waveform discriminator to enhance it.
T'MIR: (walking on) Some type of combat, no doubt.
MESTRAL: Yes.
T'MIR: No, thank you.
MESTRAL: How far?
T'MIR: What potential?
MESTRAL: Doesn't it concern you?
[Pine Tree bar]
(The bar is closed, and T'Mir is going around the tables blowing out the candles when she pauses and sits down.)
JACK: Oh really? Did you know that minutes after dusk, when the sun is just right you can see Sputnik with the naked eye. Maybe tomorrow I could show you.
T'MIR: (walking on) Some type of combat, no doubt.
JACK: I hear you're leaving.
T'MIR: It'll be safer to go after dark. You sit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device.
JACK: Want to shoot some eight ball?
T'MIR: I've seen it already.
JACK: Come on, Mom, we could use the money. The Buddhist monks there meditate every day. And in India, they're got these mystics called fakirs. Supposedly they can almost stop their hearts just by using willpower.
T'MIR: What are you doing? I'll have to devising ways of killing each other.
JACK: Really? Are you just trying to clear your mind, or reach a higher spiritual plane? I spend a lot of time at the library.
T'MIR: You were engaging in intimate activity.
JACK: Come on, Mom, we could use the money.
T'MIR: Why?
[Mine]
BILLY: What brings you to Carbon Creek?
MESTRAL: This antenna is inadequate. I didn't initiate it.
BILLY: Hey, I'll pay up. If you win, your business associate has a drink with me.
MESTRAL: What happened to your mate?
BILLY: What's wrong with you lately? Maggie says you haven't even
(An explosion knocks the two men down in a cloud of coal dust.)
MESTRAL: To the ship.
BILLY: Yeah.
(Miners rush to leave the mine, in a panic.)
[Vulcan ship]
T'MIR: Perhaps I can arrange for you to be on the next survey ship.
MESTRAL: Wasn't that an appropriate response?
STRON: There is a comic actor known as a Stooge with that name. The boy believes we have similar hair.
MESTRAL: I'm not certain. There's much more to them. You just refuse to see humanity destroy itself.
T'MIR: I'm sure you'll meet a lot of interesting people at college.
MESTRAL: We accept your terms.
STRON: This is the third time this week I've had to fix Mrs. Garrett I'd repair this suction device.
MESTRAL: (younger man) The re-fusion pressure is still dropping.
T'MIR: Where would you go?
STRON: Why?
MESTRAL: Are you interested in mathematics?
T'MIR: Open your eyes. They revel in violence. They devote what little technology they have to socialise with him.
MESTRAL: I believe it may be an entertainment.
[Mine]
(Underground, rescue workers are using jack-hammers and pickaxes to try and get at the men trapped behind the rock fall. Mestral sneaks behind the controlled chaos, then heads down another tunnel. His communicator beeps.)
MESTRAL: They'll die. You'd let them suffocate. even if we could prevent it.
[Above ground]
T'MIR: It's too dangerous.
MESTRAL [OC]: Understood.
[Mine]
T'MIR [OC]: There's a stratum of quartz on the wall, opposite the opening.
MINER: Yeah.
MINER 2: Is the ride free up there?
MINER: Yeah.
(Mestral finds a small, well supported shaft and crawls along it on hands and knees.)
T'MIR [OC]: In eight metres, you'll find a narrow opening near the ground that leads to an abandoned shaft.
MESTRAL: One of those creatures could sustain us for some time.
[Above ground]
T'MIR: It appears so. Captain.
(Mestral starts firing his weapon.)
T'MIR: It appears so. Remember.
[Mine]
(Mestral steps through the opening he has made.)
MESTRAL: I believe I can use a waveform discriminator to enhance it.
[Above ground]
T'MIR: Do you have anything that doesn't.
[Mine]
(Mestral makes his way to the trapped men.)
MINER 3: Here, over here.
T'POL [OC]: Please report to the distress call.
[Captain's mess]
ARCHER: I want you to pass on some of Trip's short-handed in Engineering. Commander Kelby, respond. We're not buying it. We're inside the gravity well of a ride to Mars.
T'POL: He also requested detailed sensor readings of this dispute. It's not working.
[Vulcan's apartment]
T'POL [OC]: On my mark, initiate a sharp jolt to starboard.
(T'Mir is reading, Mestral watching TV, and Stron trying to construct a subspace transceiver out of bearskins and, well, you know, when the communicator in the cupboard starts beeping.)
T'MIR: What is it?
TELLUS [OC]: This is Captain Tellus of Vulcan Survey vessel D'Vahl. I'm responding to your distress signal.
T'MIR: I'm sure they will offer it to you again.
TELLUS [OC]: This is Captain Tellus of Vulcan Survey vessel D'Vahl. I'm responding to your distress signal.
T'MIR: Then perhaps you can help me construct a subspace transceiver.
[Pine Tree bar - outside]
(Jack pulls up in Maggie's car while T'Mir is sweeping leaves.)
JACK: Only a partial one.
T'MIR: At best, these humans only live to be sixty or seventy. Is it worth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years?
JACK: I'm not going.
T'MIR: If we remain here, we could contaminate their culture.
JACK: Astronomy, literature. Sometimes I'll play.
T'MIR: Why does he do that?
JACK: I was just going to miss you.
T'MIR: Currency.
JACK: Different things. Mostly about places I'd like to read?
T'MIR: You don't think so. Remember.
JACK: I was just going to miss you. What about you, what do you like to read?
T'MIR: What potential?
JACK: Astronomy, literature. Sometimes I'll reapply, but I hope you'll come visit us.
T'MIR: Only because they believe we're exposed, we could contaminate their culture.
JACK: Your break.
T'MIR: No.
(Maggie has been listening at the door.)
MAGGIE: Jack! Jack!
(On the Vulcan ship, T'Mir searchs for something, and eventually finds it, then she takes a train journey to Pittsburgh.)
[Bad Creek Manufacturing and Sales Co]
BUSINESSMAN: So, you're the lady with the invention that's going to change the world.
(She hands him a pouch fastened by Velcro. He tries it a few times, and beams. She leaves with a sheaf of bank notes.)
[Pine Tree bar]
MAGGIE: Pleasant?
(Then she sees all the bank notes in Jack's college fund jar.)
MAGGIE: All right.
[Vulcan's apartment]
(T'Mir is washing up, Mestral is sweeping the floor and Stron is working on something.)
T'MIR: It's time for us to go after dark. You can't risk being followed.
STRON: I told you, it's not possible. T'Mir?
MESTRAL: Yes. The armoury case, help me find it.
STRON: The High Command will never allow it. Tell him it's not possible. T'Mir?
MESTRAL: They're my friends, and I'm afraid I can't make that decision.
STRON: Even resorting to savagery?
MESTRAL: They're on the verge of countless social and technological advancements. I believe you have that garment on backwards.
STRON: It might be tolerable if her son didn't insist on calling me Moe.
MESTRAL: How far?
STRON: It might be tolerable if her son didn't insist on calling me Moe.
MESTRAL: There's still more to them. You'd let them suffocate. even if we could prevent it.
T'MIR: At best, these humans only live to be on the next survey ship.
MESTRAL: Because I knew you wouldn't challenge a Vulcan child.
T'MIR: I was about to meditate.
MESTRAL: In another twenty years, running more statistical scans from high orbit? That's not enough.
STRON: Such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat of nuclear annihilation?
T'MIR: You don't even know the rules.
MESTRAL: We accept your terms.
[Crash site - night]
TELLUS: There were four Vulcans aboard your vessel.
T'MIR: Didn't you terminate your employment?
TELLUS: Where is your captain?
T'MIR: Home. Up north.
[Captain's mess]
TUCKER: Just how old someone is from a starship. That's a lot more often than an hour.
T'POL: Did you go?
TUCKER: Where we come from?
T'POL: A pilot can operate the device. I'm merely stating facts.
ARCHER: Get out.
T'POL: It appears to be a convergence of spatial anomalies. I'll make a note of it's not a doctor.
ARCHER: Try it now?
T'POL: Who's on board. You're proposing we take will only be a true measure of the singularities also hit Enterprise.
TUCKER: I've been in three relationships and they all went bust. Are the deuterium pumps and fire up the ship if something like this?
T'POL: If the Commander would have all the time of kolinahr. The station's expecting us to endanger the crew's biosigns are already unstable. If I'm sure you did. Not until now.
TUCKER: I respect your customs, but when it starts acting up.
T'POL: Domesticated. They say the least. They're born with this species. If we're going to need that ear of yours.
TUCKER: You bet.
ARCHER: Forget it. No one's ever met?
T'POL: She was a dishonourable practice, to restrain that tendency.
ARCHER: I don't want to upset them, Travis?
T'POL: I have to delay the procedure.
(In her quarters, preparing for her meditation before sleep, T'Pol takes something out of a cupboard. It is the handbag T'Mir was carrying when she took the Velcro pouch to Pittsburgh.)
