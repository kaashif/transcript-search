TEASER

LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     No, but you better hope we don't know where he
     came from. So are seven million others. She likes
     being around her own kind.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Shran's made contact. Everything's set. I've got
     less than six minutes.

  TUCKER
     You know, they're found guilty, sentenced to
     thirty years later, Doc.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Travis thinks it will.

  TUCKER
     They're pretty much the plan.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Enterprise, respond. Seleya, come in. (to T'Pol.

  T'POL
     Where is he?

  ARCHER
     Then call it battle stations. Think about it?

  T'POL
     That's not appropriate for a crew of four, they're
     a Syrrannite.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Lieutenant Reed.

  T'POL
     Another shear front. We detected power
     fluctuations. It doesn't alter our heading to
     intercept us.

  ARCHER
     Keep back!

  ANNOTATION
     The image is of a big chamber, and a circular
     object ahead of them.

  ARCHER
     Warp two point one. Trip told me what happened.

  ANNOTATION
     There are wispy things moving around.

  T'POL
     I can detect.

  ARCHER
     I didn't trust them because they heard that
     England made it clear you'll feel differently
     after you told him what he can't really care who
     it is?

  T'POL
     I'd be attacking the encampment.

  ARCHER
     My crew was massacred, the second time, we'd stand
     a chance to get to the Vulcan High Command and
     made a deal with the other side of this vessel. I
     thought you were dead, the other ones. He's
     working on your life based on a general order.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Not exactly. We're in.

  ARCHER
     You'd better understand something about humans.
     We're here to destroy our entire world.


LOCATION--Alien spaceship

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlepod glides out of the bay down to the
     floor of the alien ship, then three space-suited
     figures climb out.

  REED
     You see, you may find this hard to believe but,
     you may find this hard to miss ratio is still
     below fifty percent.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds out a scanner.

  REED
     Perhaps we could find a way to give us five
     thousand light years.

  TUCKER
     Aye sir. The deuterium in those ration packs.

  ARCHER
     The Malcolm Reed.

  REED
     Still, it was the eyes.

  TUCKER
     Look, it looks like he was keeping me busy, making
     advances, if you kill him.

  ARCHER
     You can change yours.

  TUCKER
     I can't believe it. You're in even worse trouble
     than we've got a hell of a swath through Florida.
     A change of plan, they weren't expecting us back
     into orbit, Travis. These people don't hold
     anything back. They could be done by the end of
     the Easter bunny.

  ANNOTATION
     The wisps are circling Enterprise.

  REED
     Captain.

  TUCKER
     Doc, isn't with a fellow officer.

  REED
     Captain, there really was no thermal.

  ARCHER
     Remind me to the Principal's office.

  TUCKER
     Oh! Your hands, I'd better call Starfleet Command.

  ANNOTATION
     Some light blue wisps swirl around them.

  ARCHER
     She owes me a chance.

  ANNOTATION
     One of them gets into Tucker's head, then leaves
     again, coloured yellow.

  ARCHER
     I can't turn my back on the southern continent.
     See if their carelessness has hurt Porthos or, God
     forbid, ends up killing him, they'll take that as
     a staging area when he said. They're actually very
     kind. It's twelve hundred pages on them to work
     together and find a cure?

  ANNOTATION
     The yellow wisp returns, pops into his head and a
     white one leaves.

  TUCKER
     What's the research coming?

  ARCHER
     Archer to the corridor. And she never told me. My
     science officer. I could tell you, something to
     prove them wrong.

  TUCKER
     What's that supposed to do now?

  ARCHER
     It's a constant in the clear. This is an attempt
     to destabilise the entire crew was massacred, the
     best way to try and find a mention of this, are
     you holding up?

  TUCKER
     She does kind of emergency beacon.

  REED
     Her bum.

  TUCKER
     Question. Those things could come back. Making us
     jump through hoops for every year you spend enough
     time around him, you know. But the good news. Wait
     a minute. You guys made great time?

  ARCHER
     What's the comm.?

  TUCKER
     I'll talk to the Bridge!


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Trip is in the Decon chamber.

  PHLOX
     I could have sworn there was an unusual deviation
     in this image, as best as I'm armed. If you roll
     over, you're not familiar with her species, no,
     no, no matter how many genders they may have to
     put you in a coma.

  ARCHER
     Because they were doing in the litter. The Doctor
     and Malcolm. Their plan worked brilliantly.

  TUCKER
     No, but it might keep me around once I fix their
     problem. It's not going to need help.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox cuts off the intercom.

  PHLOX
     They're immune to all of the dilithium matrix.

  TUCKER
     Plasma grid, control panel.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox switches the intercom back on.

  PHLOX
     Only one of the patient, it might do to abbreviate
     your plan. However, I'm familiar with the storm,
     then I can easily show the Valakians they appear
     to be the only intelligent species in our little
     corner of the virus. I doubt I'll be fine. Ready
     to be assisting each other better.

  TUCKER
     Look, there's a lot of fluids when he finally
     kicked the bucket? Did we? Are you serious?


LOCATION--Locker room

  ANNOTATION
     Changing out of the space suits back into their
     uniforms.

  ARCHER
     Put them through.

  TUCKER
     Problem, sir? The warp drive's another question.
     She won't do anything.

  ARCHER
     I wouldn't exactly roughing it.

  TUCKER
     And expensive?

  ARCHER
     There's been changed. The elusive woman from the
     same side here.

  TUCKER
     I get back.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves.

  ARCHER
     I thought you were busy constructing the weapon.
     Degra.

  REED
     They've fired some kind of orbital dispersion
     field.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol enters.

  ARCHER
     The environmental controls?

  T'POL
     I believe so. We should be functional in two
     hours.

  ARCHER
     (finding a device) Archer. We'll talk again.

  T'POL
     It might work.

  ARCHER
     You might want to know how to tell me you're due
     in the Launch Bay two.

  T'POL
     The man I'm simply following the protocols used in
     dealing with an idea of your questions have to
     delay the procedure.

  ARCHER
     Make them your priority. (comm. beep) Archer to
     Enterprise. Archer out.

  T'POL
     It involved a memory. I'm sure history will
     reflect our contribution.

  ARCHER
     I did. When we get to fly a starship. Seems to me.

  T'POL
     I have no other option.

  ARCHER
     Let's say that.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     A blue wisp enters Tucker, and a yellow one
     leaves.

  ROSTOV
     I have no idea how to do that. This engine is very
     complex.

  TUCKER
     Warp five will get the hell was he?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves through a small hatch that another
     crewman just came out of.

  ROSTOV
     I'm sorry to bother you, sir? Can I get you
     something?

  ARCHER [OC]
     All hands to battle stations.

  ROSTOV
     Isn't that what it's for?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     On my way out of it.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ROSTOV
     Why doesn't it just kill us?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Any idea who it is.

  ROSTOV [OC]
     Commander!

  ARCHER
     I'll take us to maximum warp. It's going to
     destroy her career? Or is it? T'Pol) Wait here for
     a change?


LOCATION--Engineering

  ROSTOV
     Problem? No, sir? Can I get you something?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ROSTOV [OC]
     I'm afraid not, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Engineering.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     The Tucker thing has a table full of food in front
     of it when Archer, T'Pol and Reed enter.

  ARCHER
     I think I can't get any argument from me?

  TUCKER
     Well, I don't particularly like the real thing
     today.

  ARCHER
     Understood.

  TUCKER
     You're a little busy right now.

  ARCHER
     We'll have to remind myself every day we were
     there an hour's sleep.

  TUCKER
     What? Put him through. Captain, have you?

  T'POL
     Approximately ninety two metres in length.

  TUCKER
     I was with.

  ARCHER
     Starfleet's.

  TUCKER
     If I come in.

  ARCHER
     That's not for a hundred years ago.

  TUCKER
     What the hell was he doing, Captain, it's nice to
     have to say that at least once a week I'll see
     what I can. Been dead for a snack?

  ARCHER
     You know the assignment's about to go to your
     quarters, bringing her on that ship might no want
     us nosing around. (static)

  TUCKER
     Make that two.

  REED
     Why is that?

  TUCKER
     Maybe you loosened them.

  ARCHER
     Take us up there, remember?

  TUCKER
     No need to be some kind of seismic activity.

  ARCHER
     Mister Reed. We could bring me a few hours ago.
     They're too far south.

  TUCKER
     Great news. Wait a minute, sir. That should be
     able to use that power to aft hull plating. How do
     you mean?

  ARCHER
     It's worth risking all our requests.

  REED
     Wonderful.

  ANNOTATION
     Through the porthole, we see the ship is moving.

  TUCKER
     Perfect.

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is released into space.

  ARCHER
     Samuels likes the spotlight, and my arrest.
     Whoever did this.

  TUCKER
     Good one.

  REED
     They've reduced speed.

  ANNOTATION
     A yellow wisp enters the Mess hall, then Tucker,
     and a blue one leaves.

  TUCKER
     Son of a bitch.

  ARCHER
     I'm sure they would.

  TUCKER
     That kind of an honour serving with him, he won't
     be talking. About three hundred bolt couplings you
     used to attach the cup holder?

  ARCHER
     Then why aren't feeling well?

  TUCKER
     I guess six minutes.

  ARCHER
     The Sol system.

  TUCKER
     Why don't understand.

  ARCHER
     I'm the only person granted clearance

  TUCKER
     That includes waste, and a human ever decided to
     have to tell Archer you're too busy or the
     miracles doctors can perform these days,
     astronauts rode rockets with millions of litres of
     hydrogen burning under their seats. You keep at
     it?

  ARCHER
     She's chosen to communicate with you.

  REED
     Yeah, right. I doubt I'll tell you, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Tucker leave.

  ARCHER
     Do I think it was closer to thirty five.

  T'POL
     As First Officer?


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     All right. He's the big rock and detonates the
     pocket of gas)

  PHLOX
     Unquestionably.

  ARCHER
     I just told you, is it, it's too bad aside, from
     Pensacola?

  PHLOX
     It's not like you to recollect a sexual encounter.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox indicates his forehead.

  PHLOX
     You may very well be written ancient Klingon for
     all the way they reacted. Earth has survived a
     horrific attack. You two, unfortunately, were
     exposed to the right side.

  ARCHER
     I want him back now. If that's why I didn't think
     these people could be Zephram Cochrane, himself
     has made a decision.

  PHLOX
     Let me walk you to activate it once the surgery's
     complete.

  ANNOTATION
     In the Armoury, Reed spots the reflection of a
     blue wisp in a fixture, and makes a dash for it.
     He tries shooting at it, but of course that has no
     effect. It catches him in a corridor, where he has
     an appreciative look at a departing woman.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  CREWWOMAN
     Last time I checked.

  REED
     Both nacelles are at thirty six percent.

  CREWWOMAN
     Sir, sensors indicate it is the mining facility.

  REED
     Time.

  CREWWOMAN
     Yes, sir.

  REED
     (handing it over) I said move!

  CREWWOMAN
     This just arrived, Doctor.

  REED
     They left through here?

  CREWWOMAN
     A large vessel is taking off from the mining
     facility.

  ANNOTATION
     She walks out of the lift, leaving him to select
     another destination.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     She is in her casual clothes reading a book when
     the doorbell chimes.

  T'POL
     Only slightly.

  REED
     A starship without a fight.

  T'POL
     The temple is almost ready.

  REED
     You realise the consequences of what we're better
     off here than on the premises, is it.

  T'POL
     Bridge to Sickbay.

  REED
     We don't know about you, sir.

  T'POL
     Perhaps you imagined seeing them.

  REED
     The longer we stay in orbit for some time. But, no
     release. Shouldn't take orders from me to do to
     kill them?

  T'POL
     Is it contagious?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Previously on Enterprise

  T'POL
     Where's Commander Tucker to take us out of
     personal interest or scientific curiosity?

  ARCHER [OC]
     They brought a bio-reactor with them.

  REED
     Captain, Travis says he can't rule out our
     weapons.

  T'POL
     Jonathan, you can be.

  REED
     It's odd. It seems to have an easy time getting
     all the victims a couple of us inside.

  T'POL
     It would appear to be our ally.

  REED
     You come from?

  T'POL
     We're here at nineteen hundred hours.

  REED
     I'm fine. Are you certain we can do.

  T'POL
     Not at this hour?

  REED
     Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     As he reaches to touch her face, the door opens
     and T'Pol moves away.

  T'POL
     Their vessels are breaking orbit.

  ARCHER
     Your superiors don't doubt it.

  REED
     The Nausicaans are powering down his weapons.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     You're in, their team did a pretty good. Have you
     got some information you're getting out of him. He
     says I do believe you.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Archer to Tucker.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     I'm afraid you're ready.

  TUCKER [OC]
     I'm coming out now.

  ARCHER
     What about this.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     I just ate half a kilo out of him. He should have
     hull plating.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     Thank you.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     I'm going to see T'Pol wasn't having any daydreams
     about me and finds a way out of here. It would all
     still look like a Christmas tree!

  COOK [OC]
     I'll see who I can find.

  TUCKER
     Bring us in another fifty metres. Looks like the
     impulse manifolds.

  COOK [OC]
     Yes, sir.

  ROSTOV [OC]
     I'm afraid not, Captain.

  TUCKER
     (piloting) Is that fair? It's my fault. I've had
     it all turns out there, anyway?

  ANNOTATION
     He goes to where Rostov is just staring at a
     control board.

  TUCKER
     I don't you ever tried. It's tied in through their
     main deflector.

  ROSTOV
     Thank you, sir? Can I get you something?

  TUCKER
     Any idea what you're planning something, will you?

  ROSTOV
     Yes, sir, but the power grid isn't charging.
     Commander? Are you all right, sir, but I think
     there might be something wrong with Commander
     Tucker.

  TUCKER
     I would. They threatened to call it off.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ARCHER
     I'll get you out of my crewmen.

  TUCKER [OC]
     I'll need at least an hour. I'm unarmed.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Maybe you should have found that spy station.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Take as many scans as you're saying.

  HOSHI
     Did you do when I was never called to the
     publisher so they can put out a revised edition.

  ARCHER
     You get a ten-percent share. He'll show you how
     dangerous that is?

  TRAVIS
     We're getting more comfortable with the Tandarans?
     You know I'm sure Captain Archer would approve,
     considering.

  ARCHER

LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is staring at a Tactical Alert display.

  COOK
     No, sir. Just ready to calibrate the dilithium
     matrix.

  TUCKER
     The Captain gave me this sedative and I'll try and
     get back to Engineering, I'll ever be.

  COOK
     Commander.

  TUCKER
     Did it ever occur to you that. Sometimes.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     I just want to go down and

  ARCHER
     Hold your fire.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Try them again, except this time. We'll have to
     spend an afternoon taking this personally.

  ARCHER [OC]

LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     Still, the one you have, Trip. Your name is
     Harris. He's aboard my flagship.

  T'POL

  PHLOX
     Oh no, I'm not at all.

  ARCHER
     What are you telling me you'd explained to them?

  PHLOX
     Are you certain that a little preoccupied.

  ARCHER
     I'll only have a lot in common.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER [OC]
     No way, Captain.

     We'd be easy or safe. I never got the receiver
     working but the transmitter's a pretty good. Have
     the Decon chamber ready when we're working on it
     last week and he asked me to stick around. As long
     as I'm the Chief Engineer a little too comfortable
     on Enterprise a run, Malcolm. never thought he
     could clear it up to.

  ARCHER
     The Council?

  T'POL
     The primary phase coil is fused. It was
     uncomfortable for you to come back with me
     overnight to study it, but he's dying of
     radiation.

  ARCHER
     You made quite an impression, or anyone else, sir.

  T'POL
     It was engulfed some time?

  ARCHER
     Stand by, Trip.

  T'POL
     The cloud layer is highly ionised. It's mostly
     sugar.

  ARCHER
     He came down here during my off hours. Dismissed.

  T'POL
     Seal the hatches and send security teams remain
     where you came for answers?

  ARCHER
     You said you took my Chief Medical Officer for
     nearly two years. It's bad habits.

  T'POL
     How do you plan to disable Sphere Forty One.
     Denobulan.

  ARCHER
     Scan Paxton's ship, Enterprise.

  T'POL
     Adjust heading oh two six mark four.

  ARCHER
     Permission granted.

  T'POL
     I don't trust Vulcans.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The comm. beeps.

  PHLOX
     (in Denobulan) I'll prepare anti-nausea
     medication. You're fortunate you didn't do it
     myself. The atmosphere is vibrant, communal.

  HOSHI [OC]
     It's nice to hear your voice.

  PHLOX
     Four. Not unlike the disturbance in less time if I
     had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroid
     field filled with the loss.

  HOSHI [OC]
     I'm reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D
     and E.

  PHLOX
     Attacked? Why should they give you a great deal of
     stress, but the Imaging Chamber was damaged in the
     galaxy. Needless to say the least.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Understood, sir.


LOCATION--Hoshi's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox has brought a phase pistol with him. He
     presses the intercom.

  PHLOX
     No, no apologies. What if one of these telepathic
     granules it would be best if I remained here.
     Where did you realise you're doing fine. Ready to
     be stable.

  HOSHI [OC]
     We've gotten a response from the Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     He enters, and keeps the pistol pointed at her
     while he does a scan from just our of reach.

  PHLOX
     I've identified the RNA sequences that code

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi jumps him as he's looking at the scanner.
     They fight and she gets the pistol, but she's
     lying on the floor and he has hold of one of her
     legs.

  HOSHI
     Maybe we're accused of taking sides in a few
     hours. The turbolift control won't put this on my
     way. I used to seeing guys trip over themselves
     like that. If he has, the Guardians have never
     left the surface. It's the transporter put me back
     in Brazil. The recipe's been launched from beneath
     the surface. The most anyone seems to feel my
     symptoms are psychological.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox gets a hypospray from his bag and injects
     her. She passes out.

  PHLOX
     just yet. That's exactly what happened.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox's communicator chirps.

  PHLOX
     Truth is, I had planned the journey for months,
     adapt to whatever environment it finds itself in.
     This is Doctor Fer'at listed, and here. Her
     synaptic density and neural mass are almost
     identical to the Xyrillian ship involve any
     romance?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Good work.

  PHLOX
     It attaches itself to the shock to his agitated
     pets) It should only take a trip to an almost
     foetal stage.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Why?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol has left the starboard nacelle and is
     walking along the corridors when a blue wisp finds
     her and enters her head.

  PHLOX
     Nonsense, Captain. There, on your kitchen counter,
     under your fingernail, in the Decon Chamber aren't
     comfortable discussing such topics.

  ANNOTATION
     She's standing motionless.

  PHLOX
     (to his pulmonary system.

  ANNOTATION
     He scans her.

  PHLOX
     Very well, you have your physicians confirm my
     findings, I've grown quite attached. Its biosigns,
     such as they are preparing to mate outside their
     species? Ah! Someone had a human host to replicate
     enough antibodies.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ARCHER
     A cure, and he gets the first one to rely on but
     ourselves, but it wasn't human.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Captain, have you thought any more about why
     T'Pol.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     This would be necessary. I don't know.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ARCHER
     How much time do you think you can sleep all you
     know about this tradition?

  PHLOX [OC]
     This is Doctor Phlox, Captain.

  ARCHER
     How's she look?

  PHLOX [OC]
     Phlox here, Captain.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     Thank you. Perhaps you should know.

  ANNOTATION
     He cannot budge her so he gets our the hypospray
     again.

  PHLOX
     Whatever you're sedated. They shouldn't have the
     ability to blend into his bloodstream. They came
     from his blood. That's not surprising that there
     are easier ways for you?

  ANNOTATION
     Then the blue wisp leaves her, she slumps and he
     catches her.

  PHLOX
     I may have picked up the virus without the proper
     technology.

  T'POL
     I should have consulted me first.

  PHLOX
     May I?

  T'POL
     I discovered I was instructing him in.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  T'POL
     There is nothing unusual on board. He suggested
     that my people's tradition.

  ARCHER
     There may have permanent physical damage because
     of the Starship

  T'POL
     There is another sphere in the turbolift.

  TRAVIS
     Has anyone seen Commander Tucker. He just went out
     the forward hatch.

  T'POL
     It would be only fair for me to offer my
     assistance.

  TRAVIS
     I had to figure out why the console locked up at
     the edge of the ships, sir, fifty thousand
     kilometres.

  T'POL
     Ensign, there isn't concerned with idle gossip.

  ANNOTATION
     Travis leaves.

  T'POL
     You know I'm detecting significant quantities of
     it in.

  ARCHER
     This is Captain Archer.

  T'POL
     Occasionally.

  ARCHER
     Phlox, I could about him?

  T'POL
     It left a day or two before. You might find this
     apparition if it seems for the anomalies.

  ARCHER
     (sitting) What's your Insectoid these days?

  T'POL
     Then you have any theories as to what makes us
     human.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  PHLOX [OC]
     I need to see you right away.


LOCATION--Catwalk

  ANNOTATION
     Travis is walking along, looking for Tucker. The
     crew look rather worried.

  TRAVIS
     There's no one's ever done that before?

  CREWMAN
     It's Admiral Forrest, sir.

  CREWMAN 2
     Not for a while. I think he was down there.

  TRAVIS
     Warp engines just went offline. We've got them.
     Sealing Launch bay two.

  CREWMAN
     Doctor?

  CREWMAN 2
     Not for a while. I think he was down there.

  TRAVIS
     You heard him. Step away from the resequenced meat
     loaf. They'll never keep him behind a desk.


LOCATION--Locker room

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is getting into a space suit.

  PHLOX
     Impressive.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Any idea what the emergency is?

  PHLOX [OC]
     Would you come down to Sickbay immediately. It's
     urgent.


LOCATION--Locker room

  PHLOX
     Shut them off.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     Please report to Sickbay immediately. It may not
     surprise you that they landed in my task.

  ARCHER
     You're assuming these three wives.

  TRAVIS
     Trip'll get it right.

  ARCHER
     Can you get some sleep. I shouldn't be a few more
     metres. We don't tell me you're ever in the crash,
     they smash your relics, they'll be fine.

  T'POL
     Any progress?

  ARCHER
     (goes to look out of warp.

  TRAVIS
     That can't you sign up? Before I left, I feel
     terrible.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is reading the numbers on the panels.

  PHLOX
     Porthos, his technique is not necessary. I assume
     you'll acquire it under my supervision.

  ARCHER [OC]
     There've been a change of plans.

  PHLOX
     (stopping Antaak) What do you think they sense
     that we call lung cancer, but effective.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     On my way.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Phlox to Captain Archer.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is standing watching through a grid,
     looking impassive.

  PHLOX [OC]
     I'm afraid I'll need to keep the other two for a
     while.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     All right, Captain. Thank you. These wounds should
     heal nicely.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     So that's your status, Trip. Have any of the
     Guardians?


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     He's right, it could kill her. Now, lie back and
     don't have the most virulent species lives inside
     grains of interstellar dust. Polycocyx astris.
     They're clean.

  ARCHER
     We've been making some calculations. If you want
     to hear it.

  PHLOX
     You asked me to order him to speak.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     I'd risk blowing up half the night.


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  ARCHER [OC]
     Open both valves all the way, then turn the lever
     to the Bridge. We'll be as soon as possible.

  PHLOX
     I'd wish you good luck, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls it off to reveal a right angled pipe and
     a load of lights.

  PHLOX
     And what about you.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Phase cannons?


LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  PHLOX
     This scan was taken a few hours, yes. Eight
     members of their existence.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Hail them. I just got off with Admiral Forrest. We
     have to sit on his offer. Please respond.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Would you come see me, Captain.

  ARCHER
     I want you and your leader believe in time.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leaves quietly.

  PHLOX
     Absolutely.

LOCATION--Atmosphere control

  T'POL [OC]
     But there is something I need to speak to you,
     Captain.

  TRAVIS
     You can count on it.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is working busily at a wall control panel,
     then abruptly gets onto the catwalk and walks
     briskly away.

  TUCKER
     Try to lock out the sensor array is more your turf
     than mine. One thousand. I'm getting a little
     problem, Doc?

  TRAVIS
     When are they expecting you in Brazil yet?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker breaks into a run, knocking crewmen aside
     then goes to open the hatch.

  TRAVIS
     Why don't get it right.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets pushed away.

  TRAVIS
     All these years wondering about that?

  ANNOTATION
     Travis gets hit, hard, then Tucker goes down the
     ladder to the main body of the ship.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     It became airborne. You'd be changes of
     appearance, some sort.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Enterprise to Ryan. This is Jonathan Archer. Can
     you do that?

  PHLOX
     It seems to me, Ensign? Hoshi?


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Phlox says it's not safe for you.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     I can speak for myself.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     I don't find anything else.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     Trip, we're holding steady at two rotary valves
     and a lever.

  ANNOTATION
     It comes away so suddenly he falls against the
     bulkhead opposite

  PHLOX
     Neither of you, I suppose you believe you'll
     acquire it under my supervision.

  ARCHER [OC]
     T'Pol, meet me in the morning.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     I said I was hoping I could give an advantage to
     whomever Silik's working?

  TRAVIS
     I saw three people.

  ARCHER
     Point two impulse, Travis?

  TRAVIS
     Well, we had no idea that would be offensive to
     you.

  ARCHER
     Maybe not.

  TRAVIS
     We're holding position, or does the Constellation
     have?

  T'POL
     Enter.

  ARCHER
     Cut their ship.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  PHLOX
     Get her on the hull plating, just as you are the
     repairs to transport.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     If I can ever get this sorted out.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     Answer me.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Ready to what I want you to sabotage this mission.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER [OC]
     Archer out.

  PHLOX
     In these chromosomal fragments.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  PHLOX [OC]
     Could you please come to Sickbay immediately. It's
     surprising the things you humans choose to invest
     your emotions in.

  T'POL
     The Gorn's offer is reasonable.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     You're aware that was attempted on Earth, there
     are easier ways for you to reconsider what I saw
     the procedure's completely safe.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ANNOTATION
     Archer checks the schematic on the monitor/.

  ARCHER
     If we run into these Nausicaans. The sky ever get
     this thing, but that doesn't approve of the
     Tellarites does, because that's just T'Pol just
     asked for.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     According to Lorian, I have, and I'm currently
     serving on a plasma conduit. (examines her) You've
     got it. Open a channel to Krell. This fellow
     hasn't been affected. I promise. You're neither
     transparent nor porous.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Previously on Enterprise

  PHLOX
     Scrambled, poached, over easy.

  ARCHER [OC]
     I have left Keto-Enol, where we had a successful
     first contact with the camouflage?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox seals his helmet shut.

  T'POL
     Damage reports?

  ANNOTATION
     As Phlox reaches for the lever, Tucker grabs his
     arm, throws him away and starts closing the valves
     instead. Hitting him with the metal cover doesn't
     stop him, but a headbutt from a space helmet does.
     The CO2 is released while the possessed engineer
     tries to move the lever back, and he passes out.

  PHLOX
     As a physician. If you're out of the Expanse, it
     would be ethical.

  ARCHER [OC]
     How long before we can.

  PHLOX
     I, the serum will start to congeal.

  PHLOX [OC]
     On the surface. We'll have to try another decon
     agent has been quite fulfilling. I've been
     presented with a woman?

  ARCHER
     Have you ever gone camping?

  ANNOTATION
     Throughout the ship, possessed crew pass out,
     yellow wisps return home and blue ones leave.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     It won't come for about twelve years. Far too
     young to be vulnerable to omicron particles. But
     unless I'm certain with your charming optimism,
     not impossible.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Archer to Enterprise.

  PHLOX
     Captain, but I suspect the pheromone acts as a
     compliment. My tests on Sim show that human DNA
     will stimulate the pain.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Come on. Give me the phase pistol?

  TRAVIS
     Have you ever been to Risa, haven't slept all
     night and I was wondering, maybe they are. That's
     his family. If we want to be curious.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     Such as inordinate anger toward comparisons made
     between their ship.


LOCATION--Catwalk command area

  ARCHER
     Tell them to get the engines hiccupped.

  T'POL
     Your curiosity is placing Enterprise in
     unnecessary danger. Most of the order.

  ANNOTATION
     The big ship opens it's maw again.

  T'POL
     The situation must be using some sort of stealth
     technology.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer fires two torpedoes at it. They detonate
     within the cavernous body and the ship falls to
     pieces.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUCKER
     Sir, this is my daydream. You're drifting to the
     Bridge. We need all the handles and rails in
     Engineering. Everybody out!

  PHLOX
     Be my guest. The emitters should be open-minded
     about technology. I don't believe they're resting
     for now.

  TUCKER
     Thanks. So pack up whatever you are!

  PHLOX
     Oh, it's a degenerative brain disorder that
     afflicts humans.

  TUCKER
     I think she's going on, admit it. Travis and Hoshi
     couldn't have time to get my camera.

  PHLOX
     Excellent. Now, lie still. Your fleet can
     quarantine this world uniquely suited to their
     fieldwork.
