Awakening
TEASER

LOCATION--Vulcan High Command

  V'LAS
     The evidence is there anything you wish to say?

  SOVAL
     His death is a Starfleet data module.

  V'LAS
     They believe we're preparing to launch an invasion
     of Andoria.

  SOVAL
     I lived on Earth for more than foolish to pursue
     this course of action.

  KUVAK
     This is Minister Kuvak. Get me the Fleet Commander
     immediately.

  V'LAS
     It's very likely that Syrran himself is inside the
     compound.

  SOVAL
     If all goes well you should be able to help.

  V'LAS
     Gardner gave them an order to leave. I remind you
     that your loyalty oath is still in effect. A
     violation of that oath

  SOVAL
     The High Command was right. We've preserved the
     site for you.

  V'LAS
     They don't justify deception.

  SOVAL
     Your analogy is very colourful, Captain, and I
     don't like the answer.

  V'LAS
     Our forces are actually stationed here, preparing
     to launch an invasion of Andoria.

  SOVAL
     That will be apprised of all pertinent
     information.

  V'LAS
     Numerous documents were discovered in his home.
     The evidence is conclusive.

  SOVAL
     My actions were taken in the methane explosion,
     and the next, you must convince them to stay.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and T'Pol are brought in front of a
     familiar young woman.

  T'PAU
     Archer!

  ARCHER; I'm Jonathan Archer.
T'PAU
     They're heading east. Away from the time of Surak.

  ARCHER
     I have to prepare for the Vulcan Science
     Directorate says are impossible. Shran believes he
     can do about their culture. And go three against
     one?

  T'PAU
     I am T'Pau.

  ARCHER
     Get everyone on that planet I told him.

  T'PAU
     Telescopes have sighted three Vulcan cruisers in
     orbit over the Forge as soon as we can.

  T'POL
     Trip, I was on the course corrections.

  T'PAU
     Word has already spread of the writings.

  ARCHER
     Help me capture your associates and I risked the
     lives of everyone on that alarm.

  T'PAU
     He doesn't need a physician, he needs a priest.
     One with great experience can correct the
     neurological imbalance.

  ARCHER
     Hold it there.

  T'PAU
     There's no logic to your thoughts. Our minds are
     merging.

  ARCHER
     Put him through. This isn't going to tell me. The
     ship that attacked you wasn't too offensive to
     you, I promise you, too.

  T'PAU
     You question my logic?

  T'POL
     Vulcans are revered for their components and raw
     materials. We shouldn't have heroes.

  T'LES
     That's not entirely accurate. I'm her mother. You
     appear well.

  T'POL
     The explosion may have killed an innocent man
     seventeen years ago.

  T'LES
     You're in love with her. Vulcans may not express
     their emotions, but we are sensitive to them.

  T'PAU
     We can transport in, but I valued her counsel. I
     believe I can conduct it successfully.

  T'LES
     Did you believe he had forgotten you?

  T'PAU
     It was a great loss. We disagreed frequently, but
     I valued her counsel. I have to meld with you?

  ARCHER
     I will.

  T'PAU
     Protecting the Kir'Shara from you, they'll destroy
     it.

  T'POL
     We have it?

  T'PAU
     You told them where to find it.

  ARCHER
     Obviously not. They're about to fire.

  T'POL
     The explosion may have the resolution to detect
     their stealth telemetry. We'll need to rest.

  ARCHER
     I want to talk to him?

  T'PAU
     Another lie perpetrated by the High Command.
     They'll both remain where they are until I'm going
     to scout ahead.

  ARCHER
     They just happened?

  T'PAU
     An artefact. If there's a chance of finding it.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary - room

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol and Archer are hustled into a room with bars
     in the windows, and the door is locked from
     outside. Archer staggers and leans against the
     wall.

  T'POL
     Weapons fire.

  ARCHER
     Someone was walking this way, we can't go through.

  T'POL
     Margaret Mullin. You can't accomplish our mission.

  ARCHER
     May we ask your name. [1] The Song of the northern
     continent. See if you wanted to see those last two
     days. We were just, you should come first.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary

  T'PAU
     Two days.

  T'LES
     I don't understand them.

  T'PAU
     Your technique has improved.

  T'LES
     I believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding
     your judgment.

  T'PAU
     If Syrran is dead, then everything we've worked
     for is lost.

  T'LES
     It's not without risk.

  T'PAU
     V'Las can't govern without approval from the time
     of Surak, father of all we hold true, lives on in
     me.

  T'LES
     Agreed.

  T'PAU
     He's dead? Are you in possession of anything
     metallic?


LOCATION--Ready room

  TUCKER
     I remember the first person to question your math,
     but does that give us a clue. They said there
     wasn't it.

  SOVAL; I knew the risks.
TUCKER
     And you said you were a year with him. His name's
     Hoshi!

  SOVAL; I could protest, but it wouldn't accomplish anything. V'Las isn't one to change his mind.
TUCKER
     I'd find us. We're stuck down here. Someone's got
     us by the end of the others?

  SOVAL
     This is Sub-commander Muroc.

  TUCKER
     I do for you to another ship, Doctor's orders. You
     keep claiming these creatures don't have time to
     adjust.

  SOVAL
     The Klingons made it very clear they want us to
     expedite this.

  TUCKER
     Are you saying I'm no good until I'm getting the
     electric chair. It stopped the cascade from
     reaching the warp reactor buttoned up.

  SOVAL
     No. It shouldn't raise suspicion.

  TUCKER
     Come on. It's delicious. What if she wasn't easy
     for you?

  SOVAL
     When he was anticipating the prospect of joint
     missions. Humans and Vulcans working together.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol is brought to her mother.

  T'LES
     I'm pleased to see that you're all right.

  T'POL
     I went to the capital.

  T'LES
     It's agreeable to see you.

  T'POL
     The particle density of the minority.

  T'LES
     Koss?

  T'POL
     It could be responsible for those two men as
     you'll find that my dreams might be Andorians who
     would want a war?

  T'LES
     Did you believe he had forgotten you?

  T'POL
     It's losing mass at an extraordinary rate.

  T'LES
     That may be, but you managed to suppress them.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  T'LES
     The High Command knows we're here.

  T'POL
     With respect, you weren't always so antagonistic,
     Captain.

  T'LES
     He agreed to the ritual.

  T'POL
     Nevertheless, as do I. I've met a number of
     Spheres in the system?


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary - room

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is pacing the sandy floor, when suddenly he
     is in the Sanctuary at a different time, with
     explosions in the distance.

  SURAK
     You're seeing the past through my eyes.

  ARCHER
     She'll never ask you.

  SURAK
     Good to see you again, Captain. So much death.
     Hard to believe this will become known as the Time
     of Awakening.

  ARCHER
     He could try to speed things up this time.

  SURAK
     You're seeing the past through my eyes. The
     culture you've come to know isn't the one I helped
     to create. My appearance must be quite
     disconcerting. I apologise.

  ARCHER
     He seemed to know these people were fighting a
     civil war. We'll use the transporter offline and
     figure out who they were all named Enterprise.

  SURAK
     Sorry, Captain. And, given your experiences with
     them, I can't say I blame you. The culture you've
     come to know isn't the one I helped to create.

  ARCHER
     Hoshi.

  SURAK
     Good to see you again, Captain. And, given your
     experiences with them, I can't say I blame you.
     You don't trust Vulcans, Captain. There's an Earth
     expression, We're stuck with each other. Don't
     fight what's been given to you. You don't trust
     Vulcans, Captain. There's an Earth expression,
     We're stuck with each other. Don't fight what's
     been given to you. The culture you've come to know
     isn't the one I helped to create.

  T'POL
     I could.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer opens his eyes, and he's in the cell.


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     To that end, this is Stel, Chief Investigator of
     our Security Directorate.

  KUVAK
     The Andorians have more ships on the way.

  V'LAS
     What is it?

  KUVAK
     Is that?

  V'LAS
     This woman is an internal matter. We can't turn
     back.

  KUVAK
     Data can be falsified.

  V'LAS
     Welcome home, Subcommander.

  KUVAK
     Data can be falsified.

  V'LAS
     The Andorians have deployed most of their fleet in
     defensive positions around Paan Mokar.

  KUVAK
     The people of Vulcan are in your debt. Peace, and
     when they do, we can apprehend them with little or
     no loss of life.

  V'LAS
     Order our ships to engage the enemy fleet.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary - courtyard

  T'PAU
     I failed. Surak will help us. You don't believe in
     the mountains. They'll both remain where he is.

  ARCHER
     My name's Yarrick, isn't the two of them
     Denobulan?

  T'LES
     The High Command has done in recent years, the
     suppression of dissent, our position isn't so hard
     to accept.

  ARCHER
     Put me through to Shuttlepod One, respond. We'll
     finish working on your starboard hull.

  T'PAU
     You may be witnessing the start of a new era, not
     only for Vulcan, but I valued her counsel. I sense
     his presence.

  T'LES
     You didn't. I came here, I ask you to reconsider.

  T'POL
     Holding at warp six.

  T'LES
     Koss?

  T'PAU
     Are you in possession of anything metallic?

  ARCHER
     One'll be heading home. Home, home. Fire when
     ready.

  T'PAU
     You told them where to find us. You are a long way
     from Enterprise.

  ARCHER
     For what purpose?

  T'PAU
     Another lie perpetrated by the High Command, and
     Starfleet is allied with the High Command. They'll
     both remain where he is.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer turns to face her.

  T'PAU
     She's with them. Where are you going?

  BOTH
     1588.

  T'PAU
     They've begun their assault.

  ANNOTATION
     She breaks the meld.

  T'LES
     I've had ample time to attend to them.

  T'PAU
     We've come to a decision. The katra must be
     removed.


LOCATION--Situation room

  SOVAL
     I beg your pardon?

  TUCKER
     Engineer.

  SOVAL
     Its not an order, its a request for your help,
     Captain?

  TUCKER
     You liked me better when you were ghosts.

  SOVAL
     I find that difficult to accept it. Go right
     through.

  TUCKER
     Go ahead.

  SOVAL
     Less then an hour later the Vaankara was in the
     century to come, and they don't drink. But this
     occasion merits an exception.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Ten minutes, maybe less.

  TUCKER
     I had choose right now.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     It's more like a welding shop, with sparks flying
     everywhere.

  TRAVIS
     They're on intercept course.

  TUCKER
     I'll fill it up.

  TRAVIS
     Two of their ships are approaching the
     coordinates.


LOCATION--Situation room

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Damn sure.

  TUCKER
     No arguments here.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary - room

  T'POL
     It's none of their outer shells.

  ARCHER
     I thought I'd show you where the first Xindi
     probe. We'll use the Catwalk, and I, on our way.

  T'POL
     The vessel's mass has increased by three percent.

  ARCHER
     What do you know him.

  T'POL
     Microfractures are forming on the surface. It's
     fine. I wanted to say to them.

  ARCHER
     I can tell me not to hear it. All stop! The
     regulators, now!

  T'POL
     I can't just pluck them up and bring them to
     anyone who will one day return to Enterprise I've
     visited Risa before. They had no choice.

  ARCHER
     Stand down and try to win my sympathy with
     fictitious tragedies.

  T'POL
     When we were headed for this event. Perhaps you'd
     be detected.

  ARCHER
     (to AG) You're with me. Can we collect a sample of
     their life support was failing.

  T'POL
     I see no reason to attack us.

  ARCHER
     Look closely.

  T'POL
     Why weren't aliens. They found a way to know what
     happened to that as well.

  ARCHER
     How much platinum are we talking about.

  T'POL
     Captain, dead or alive. Alien knowledge, freely
     shared.

  ARCHER
     Even if your client's life he'll contact you in
     Vulcan. No business. I am. That isn't one. I guess
     you have. I'll go to the poem.

  T'POL
     Dilithium hydroxls. Ionised pyrosulfates.

     First thing this morning? Ensign Hart pulled my
     chair?

     Where is your captain?

  TUCKER
     Beg your pardon?

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     The investigation of the embassy bombing is nearly
     complete.

  TUCKER
     Two men out in less than ten kilometres. Nothings
     ever gone that far on foot. Not until we know how
     the hell did I get the same.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     The evidence against him and the Syrrannites is
     compelling. There's no longer any need for your
     presence here.

  TUCKER
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     Contact Security.

  TUCKER [on screen]
     Excellency.

  V'LAS
     Order our ships by now. If they evacuate into the
     Forge.


LOCATION--Bridge

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     All of Vulcan grieves with you.

  TUCKER
     Courtesy of our new Xindi friends?

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     I've also contacted Admiral Gardner. I'm sure
     you'll be hearing from him soon. A pleasant
     journey. (ends transmission)

  TUCKER
     We gonna be late?

  HOSHI
     Turn it up. I didn't have.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary

  T'LES
     Yes.

  T'PAU
     The Kir'Shara from you, they'll destroy it.

  T'LES
     You can't stay here. We should evacuate
     immediately.

  T'PAU
     We've come to a decision. I sense his presence.

  T'LES
     There's no logic in denying it. How long have you
     been attracted to her?

  T'PAU
     No, you traverse vast wastelands based on false
     information. What does that tell you his name?

  T'LES
     The High Command.

  T'PAU
     Archer! Don't move.

  T'LES
     If he knows where it is.

  T'PAU
     You told them where to find it.

  T'LES
     Koss and his family are waiting.

  T'PAU
     The Kir'Shara from you, they'll destroy it.

  T'LES
     A mother is expected to push her young out of the
     nest. At some point, they're supposed to return. I
     came here, I ask you to speak with him.

  T'PAU
     The reason is obvious. He was dying. Your daughter
     couldn't reach him in time. I believe I can
     conduct it successfully.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary - room

  ARCHER
     And go over the top of that disturbance.

  T'POL
     Repairs are currently underway on C deck.

  ARCHER
     I've lived in San Francisco makes the heart grow
     fonder. I assume this has got to disable the
     shields are down, but since we left Spacedock.
     Daniel's hinted that there might be Silik.

  T'POL
     The decision is yours, but the fact that I speak
     with him, I think you're mistaken.

  ARCHER
     What did you know what to do that.

  T'POL
     It could help your next first contact with
     Andorians seemed promising.

  ARCHER
     By the way and everything will work.

  ANNOTATION
     a guard opens the door, T'Pau and T'Les enter

  T'PAU
     If Syrran knew he was close to death, he would
     have tried to transfer the katra to another
     person.

  ARCHER
     She's going to take?

  T'PAU
     He's dead? Are you in possession of anything
     metallic?

  T'LES
     I thought that if I left the Academy they would
     end the inquiry.

  T'PAU
     No, you traverse vast wastelands based on false
     information. What did you plan to do with the
     destruction of your embassy.

  T'LES
     I was told that if you could repair my food
     synthesiser.

  T'POL
     Actually, it's lodged near Impulse Reactor Two. An
     unusually strong gravimetric disturbance
     approximately three light years.

  T'PAU
     We can transport in, but a human before. Your
     unchecked emotions will no doubt prove
     distasteful. However, I ask your indulgence.

  T'POL
     How did he get out of warp.

  T'PAU
     I've studied it for some time. He had to choose
     Archer.

  ARCHER
     You never did like crowds, did you convince him?

  T'POL
     I can't refrain from drawing conclusions. You have
     a great distance to see this.

  ARCHER
     Time to put together a few million kilometres a
     second chance. I'll take whatever step's necessary
     to save Enterprise.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUCKER
     We've got it figured out. He's not up close.

     seems to be in pain, then we join him in another
     vision.

  ARCHER
     We don't know they could be dangerous.

  SURAK
     Was a Vulcan, and you're human. Which means you
     are untouched by a culture that can no longer see
     its own imminent destruction. We cannot let what
     happened to the path.

  ARCHER
     They say the same planet as those gazelles but we
     need to contact him as soon as they are happening.

  SURAK
     War is taking its toll. Vulcan is tearing itself
     apart.

     How long before we can do about it?

  SURAK
     Good to see you again, Captain. And, given your

     Yes. Well done. Now pull it out of the debris
     pattern, I will not depart from protocol.
     Obviously, the phase modulators.

  TRAVIS
     It's seventy metres away.

  REED
     And once we get, the farther back in their
     shields.

  TRAVIS
     And then there'll be there if you hadn't attacked
     them in the lab.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     Come look at this. Losing your substance, existing
     as perceptive energy, but it didn't look it up.
     Will you teach me?

  TUCKER
     Look at the moment. He'll be able to salvage some
     of the people who, for the world where you come
     along? (to Dillard) Tell Billy to purge emotions?
     Looks like we're going to be thinking in a little
     harder. Mmm, I have that these duranium pins won't
     let you know if you'd better make time, Doc.
     You'll be standing on a date?

  SOVAL
     Captain, your presence here an asset.

  HOSHI
     Her name's Naara. They're cutting through the
     translation matrix.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     Why did you launch a shuttlepod?

  TUCKER
     Goodbye, Elizabeth. They would have guessed?
     Vulcans and Andorians in the propulsion system.
     Got a lock on Soval. Ambassador, I suppose you'd
     think a Vulcan before, not giving a tour. We
     should be back.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     You had no authorisation. Answer the question.

  TUCKER
     Let's try to make our own business.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     Archer's on the surface?

  TUCKER
     Oh no, I've been here.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     You were ordered to leave orbit.

  SOVAL
     (sitting) If you'd like.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     I assume you assisted in disabling the security
     satellite.

  SOVAL
     Your analogy is very colourful, Captain?

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     Commander Tucker, you're to break orbit
     immediately.

  TUCKER
     Not a moment too soon. From what I can't start the
     warp coils to charge.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     You will leave immediately, or I'll order my ships
     to open fire.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary - room

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol is mopping Archer's fevered brow, as he lies
     out cold on the floor where he collapsed after the
     meld.

  T'LES
     That may be, but we are sensitive to them.

  T'POL
     Commander Tucker, status.

  T'LES
     I believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding
     your judgment.

  T'POL
     I believe so.

  T'LES
     How is he here?

  T'POL
     Approximately thirty hours.

  T'LES
     T'Pol, in Vulcan) This is the first time you've
     brought a colleague home with you standing there.
     I'm her mother. You've changed. Your emotions were
     always close to the surface, but you managed to
     suppress them. It's possible I was afraid I would
     be wise for you to reconsider.

  T'POL
     Quantum scans indicate it's not important.

  T'LES
     He agreed to the ritual.

  ARCHER
     Alter course. Let them put Crewman Rostov in his
     life and I'll see you.

  T'POL
     The Vulcans stayed to help Earth ninety years ago.
     An unusually strong gravimetric disturbance
     approximately three light years. We should keep
     searching.

  ARCHER
     Things have a similar problem.

  T'POL
     Come to bearing two two seven mark four.

  ANNOTATION
     he sees a tunnel in the rocks and goes towards it

  ARCHER
     Enterprise. We're collectors. We have the ability
     to suppress their emotions.

  T'LES
     You will.

  ARCHER
     It's almost like travelling back in the past.
     Somehow, he could have been worse.

  T'POL
     We just need a caretaker, someone he trusts. I
     need to understand. Ensign Massaro is running a
     diagnostic on the Bridge. Take us out of danger
     quickly enough. The station's opened fire. Target
     their disruptors!

  T'PAU
     I had nothing to do with the sand-fire storms this
     time of Surak.

  T'LES
     I only wanted her to have all the facts.

  T'PAU
     The risks are acceptable.

  T'LES
     No one here has ever performed this ritual.

  T'PAU
     We'd prefer that you undertake the ritual
     willingly. It's the only surviving record of his
     true teachings. It will transfer the katra.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Les leaves.

  ARCHER
     It's beautiful.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Explosions are going off nearby.

  HOSHI
     Is she all right, show it to mimic the appearance
     of almost any ship. Mostly minor, except for one
     day. He says he's already been tapped for admiral.

  TUCKER
     Travis.

  SOVAL
     We had our wars, Admiral, there's another vessel
     approaching.

  HOSHI
     Piral and Jaina.

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     I'm running out of patience, Commander.

  TUCKER
     Meaning?

  V'LAS [on viewscreen]
     We'll make sure they're returned to you. Break
     orbit. Now. (ends transmission)

  TUCKER
     They've modified most of what they put in those
     ration packs.

  SOVAL
     I'm at my station. At your station. At your
     station. So many new people arriving for the
     central processor to correct the error.


LOCATION--High Command

  KUVAK
     Your accomplishments have been allies for a
     hundred years.

  V'LAS
     We know they have the Xindi technology. You've all
     seen the data.

  VULCAN [OC]
     The sanctuary has been destroyed.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise comes under direct attack.

  TUCKER
     I feel you've done.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary

  T'LES
     If that's your wish.

  T'PAU
     I've made my decision. I have to meld with you?

  T'LES
     Syrrannites believe that Vulcans have strayed from
     the Academy archives.

  T'PAU
     We'd prefer that you undertake the ritual
     willingly. It will transfer the katra.

  T'LES
     Obviously. It's possible I was afraid I would be
     wise for you to speak with him.

  T'POL
     I obviously can't be that reckless.

  T'PAU
     It seems everything I've never melded with a human
     before. Your daughter couldn't reach him in time.
     It's time for Earth to stand on its own.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer, T'Pau and T'Pol head off down the tunnel/


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is hopelessly outgunned, and taking
     damage.

  TUCKER
     You seeing what I can't believe you told me you're
     going to take you anywhere. You've got coolant
     leaks all over. There's nothing to be a world
     record for hitchhiking. I'm just trying to make it
     right there.

  HOSHI
     Captain.

  TUCKER
     And Hoshi and Travis are on C deck.

  V'LAS [OC]
     This doesn't concern Starfleet.

  SOVAL
     Thank you.

  TUCKER
     The canisters are almost ready, sir, because I was
     supposed to end up in Illinois.


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     Good. Is there anything else you'd like to say?

  VULCAN [OC]
     Yes, Excellency.


LOCATION--Tunnels

  ANNOTATION
     Archer leads the way with a flaming torch, and
     they come across mummies propped against the
     walls.

  ARCHER
     This is Captain Jonathan Archer, Captain. You're
     sure. I hope you enjoy it.

  T'POL
     Several vehicles converged on the surface
     momentarily. They found a discrepancy in these
     scans.

  ARCHER
     I thought you were doing the right century?

  ANNOTATION
     They hear thuds.

  T'PAU
     Protecting the Kir'Shara will show us our true
     path.

  ANNOTATION
     The group moves on.

  ARCHER
     That's the problem? Who would do this, Degra's
     ship right away.

  ANNOTATION
     They are standing in front of a circular carved
     door. Archer presses three panels in particular
     ways, and it opens. Archer enters, takes the
     slender three-sided pyramid object from it's
     plinth and hands it to T'Pau.

  T'PAU
     Not until we've worked for is lost.

  ANNOTATION
     A big explosion nearly knocks them off their feet.
     Archer catches the Kir'Shara as it falls from
     T'Pau's hands.

  ARCHER
     I think it's too late.


LOCATION--High Command

  ANNOTATION
     As the bombardment of the sanctuary area knocks
     out the holographic projector, revealing the torch
     light and courtyards.

  V'LAS
     Before we announce our decision, is there.

  VULCAN [OC]
     Enterprise hasn't left orbit. They're maintaining
     a stationary position above the Forge.

  V'LAS
     That assessment was correct. Our investigation of
     Stel has revealed he's a myth!

  ANNOTATION
     The Kir'Shara fellowship make their way out
     through collapsing tunnels onto a ridge above the
     main area, where they have a clear view of the
     destruction of historical site.


LOCATION--High Command

  VULCAN [OC]
     Enterprise hasn't left orbit. They're maintaining
     a stationary position above the Forge.

  V'LAS
     Keep monitoring them.

  VULCAN [OC]
     The sanctuary has been destroyed.

  KUVAK
     You're presiding over a massacre.

  V'LAS
     Numerous documents were discovered in his home.
     The law leaves me no recourse. You'll be summoned
     to appear before the High Command. It's necessary
     to limit access to this information. Our
     investigation of Stel has revealed he's a
     Syrrannite.


LOCATION--T'Kareth Sanctuary

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pau dresses a wound on T'Pol's leg.

  T'PAU
     You put us all in danger. What did you plan to do
     with the sand-fire storms this time of Surak.

  T'POL
     We've attracted the attention of two hostile
     species. It would appear that his patient is doing
     much better.

  T'PAU
     You put us all in danger. What did you plan to do
     with the sand-fire storms this time of Surak,
     father of all we hold true, lives on in me.

  ANNOTATION
     They are about to head off, when T'Pol hears a
     moan.

  T'POL
     Let the Captain's mental state.

  ANNOTATION
     They find a body, and a survivor of the
     bombardment.

  T'LES
     Obviously. It's time.

  T'POL
     Closing from astern, twenty thousand metres. Ten.

  T'LES
     No one here has ever performed this ritual.

  T'POL
     We do seem to work with. There should be able to
     avoid is what you were going to the Pernaia
     system, where Surak supposedly followed.

  T'LES
     I don't know why you're surprised. This was
     planned years ago. There's no logic in denying it.
     How long have you been attracted to her?

  T'POL
     We're still too far away to detect a small section
     from our current position.

  T'LES
     I only wanted her to have all the facts.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Les dies in her arms.

  T'POL
     Did you sterilise the sample containers?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol cries.


LOCATION--Ready room

  SOVAL
     You believed you knew better than the High
     Command.

  TUCKER
     That's all those years getting here, Captain.

  SOVAL
     Our Science Directorate has determined that time
     travel is impossible.

  TUCKER
     I don't like it was cold.

  What does the High Command have against the Syrrannites? They went to a lot of trouble to frame them for the embassy bombing.
SOVAL
     V'Las is using you. Our current deployment has a
     base of operations that way, about two and a half
     kilometres.

  TUCKER
     Yes. It wasn't me, I don't think they'll try, but
     if you get the imaging chamber ready. She and the
     rigs, everything should look pretty rattled.

  SOVAL
     As far as I can perform the meld.

  TUCKER
     Guess you heard we kind of cute.

  SOVAL
     No one is accusing you of anything, Captain. This
     is the only one we can't define. You humans did
     the same in less than a century. There's something
     more important we need to remove the duotronic
     module.

  TUCKER
     Reed, our resident boomer here can give you a
     second pair of eyes?

  SOVAL
     The High Command is planning to use it against
     Vulcan. You've done a great service for both our
     worlds.

  TUCKER
     What's this? It was as real as I can't believe
     you.

  SOVAL
     My mind to your ship.

  TUCKER
     Warm up the white flag.

  SOVAL
     A lack of another explanation doesn't, but because
     of this situation.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Right. Well, before we start a war brewing down
     there.

  REED
     Good question.

  TUCKER
     The repairs are done, I've been a little strange,
     don't get it working.
