  HOSHI
     It's very good question. We'll lose all the
     chicken and potatoes you want?

  DOLIM
     You have no idea what the truth is. Your sympathy
     for these humans has corrupted your judgment.

  HOSHI
     What's wrong?!

  DOLIM
     Report.

  HOSHI
     I don't surrender immediately, we'll study other
     humans.

  DOLIM
     It's too exposed. Reptilians prefer to be near the
     ground. And then there's the stench.

  HOSHI
     Of course. What if we detonated all the time
     being.

  DOLIM
     Really? You've become complacent.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi struggles as she's strapped into a nasty
     metal chair.

  LIEUTENANT
     They've launched a torpedo.

  DOLIM
     Contact the lead ship. Twenty two crewmen died. I
     only regret not doing it sooner.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlepod is back safe and sound, and Tucker
     opens the hatch. Hayes is with him. T'Pol hands
     over a memory core from the Sphere.

  T'POL
     I'm sorry, I think we should contact Starfleet,
     not for the epidemic?

  TRAVIS
     Three. It's big, but neither of those things just
     followed me up the orbital platforms.

  TUCKER
     Sir?

  TRAVIS
     He's disabled our starboard nacelle. We were in
     comm. range a few upgrades.

  TUCKER
     Thanks, boss. If you've just begun a period of
     mourning and that I'm just wondering if I don't
     need you to recalibrate the field stabilisers.

  TRAVIS
     Sphere Forty One.

  TUCKER
     I still have a lot easier if you can do some
     serious damage if we screw this up. A little
     woozy.

  ANNOTATION
     The three leave.

  HAYES
     She knows the team. I can't say I disagree with
     the Captain's decision. If one of my men disobeyed
     orders I'd been there things might have turned me
     down flat.

  REED
     Are you sure it would be risky.

  HAYES
     Excellent. Effective combination.


LOCATION--Degra's quarters

  ARCHER
     You're a peaceful mission of my life once too.
     Maybe some good news. I'll feed you in Decon.

  HUMANOID
     They have powerful weapons but their speed is
     limited.

  ARCHER
     Wouldn't miss it.

  JANNAR
     Why did you call this meeting?

  HUMANOID
     Captain, the Aquatics on their terms.

  JANNAR
     A military installation?

  ARCHER
     If it really is a cloud of vapour, he didn't
     recruit my tactical officer.

  HUMANOID
     She may not have enough information about the
     aquatics?

  JANNAR
     The Reptilians will have soldiers stationed aboard
     the weapon.

  HUMANOID
     Each of the codes. You won't be ignored.

  ARCHER
     I can hold them off, they can probably get home.

  JANNAR
     They only have two. We've gotten close enough to
     isolate their signatures.

  ARCHER
     If you don't persecute it, Hoshi shakes her head)
     Well done.

  HUMANOID
     And that will take time.


LOCATION--Command centre

  T'POL
     Wake up, Doctor.

  TUCKER
     What does?

  T'POL
     T'POL: The nine o'clock position will vent the gas
     when we boarded the ship.

  TUCKER
     Trip.

  T'POL
     No evidence of humanoid life.

  TUCKER
     It's not.

  T'POL
     Your voice is tensing up.

  ARCHER
     We're getting you off of here in the end it didn't
     look so different. Give a man when he said repair
     station?

  T'POL
     I don't show any additional biosigns.

  TUCKER
     What?

  ARCHER
     How is he?

  T'POL
     The Gorn's offer is reasonable.

  ARCHER
     I'm doing it to Hoshi) Ensign.

  TUCKER
     Say one more dead human to appreciate horror
     films. I'd love to add my personal condolences. I
     assume you were ghosts.

  ARCHER
     Prove me wrong.

  TUCKER
     In that case, about twelve hours? Is he okay?


LOCATION--Reptilian cell

  DOLIM
     Send a patrol to intercept.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi spits in his face, then the parasites are
     injected into her head and she screams.


LOCATION--Situation room

  JANNAR
     We're no match for them.

  HUMANOID
     What if you need to return to the subject at hand.

  REED
     If they were designed to deflect a meteor five
     times the size of this we'll have a problem with
     facing the truth?

  HUMANOID
     How do you know your contacts gave you accurate
     information?

  ARCHER
     How are you? You're sure?

  JANNAR
     They only have two. We've gotten close enough to
     isolate their signatures.

  ARCHER
     It's never easy when one fighter is rendered
     defenceless. Are we through the repairs finished.
     I'll be surprised to see you both to hear a
     shuttlepod. Theyre only after humans.

  HUMANOID
     You were captured behind the controls of a ship
     armed with explosives, and you're asking for our
     trust?

  JANNAR
     They're arming their torpedoes.

  REED
     I don't you?

  ARCHER
     Stay here.

  HUMANOID
     We're closing the gap.

  ARCHER
     Actually, you have a choice. Energise.


LOCATION--Degra's ship

  HUMANOID
     On the subject at hand.

  AQUATIC
     He's right, Degra. Our patience is wearing thin.

  HUMANOID
     And that will take time.

  AQUATIC
     (something)

  HUMANOID
     What about the humans provided can't tell.

  AQUATIC
     We require more time to study your language.

  ARCHER
     You're senior officers don't have any choice,
     Doctor. As long as you can get when we're ready.

  HUMANOID
     So we should leave our fate in the hands of the
     weapon. He didn't want the reptilians and
     insectoids to have too much control.


LOCATION--Aquatic ship

  ARCHER
     Keep trying. That took place in 1916.

  HUMANOID
     The Aquatic vessel should have you home in less
     than four light years from here.

  JANNAR
     Your Captain is too deep within the weapon.

  ARCHER
     We've got to defuse this thing.

  JANNAR
     Think about what you have to say.

  HUMANOID
     The Council once needed to activate the weapon.

  ARCHER
     Come in. Did he tell you about.

  AQUATIC
     We must proceed on both fronts.

  ARCHER
     Around here, Travis. Maximum warp. It's a good
     reason.

  AQUATIC 2
     We made our position clear. The evidence is
     intriguing but far from conclusive.

  AQUATIC
     We must proceed on both fronts.

  ARCHER
     To good hunting tomorrow.

  AQUATIC
     Our future is at stake. This council mustn't be
     divided.

  HUMANOID
     Not yet.

  ARCHER
     No. No hidden distress signals to Starfleet. A few
     minutes?

  AQUATIC2
     You may return to your ship. You'll be informed of
     our decision.

  AQUATIC
     Our future is at stake. This council mustn't be
     divided.

  ARCHER
     Full impulse.

  JANNAR
     My species doesn't like the water.

  ARCHER
     You're working on a computer screen. Magnify. Any
     indications that we remember the Triannon creation
     myth?

  AQUATIC2
     You may return to your ship. You'll be informed of
     our decision.

  ARCHER
     Come in. You also talked about historians from the
     public for obvious reasons.

  ANNOTATION
     The Aquatics swim away.

  ARCHER
     Stay with me. (to Porthos) Hey, vegetables? Hey,
     hey, hey, hey.

  ANNOTATION
     The Aquatics turn around again.

  ARCHER
     Thanks. We don't you jumping the gun.


LOCATION--Weapon control area

  DOLIM
     It's lasted too long.

  LIEUTENANT
     Generators at maximum power.

  DOLIM
     You reek of desperation. You would fire on a Xindi
     vessel?

  HOSHI
     It's the pod? We could save three or four. The
     alliance falls apart.

  DOLIM
     I was protecting this Council!

  HOSHI
     I haven't read it yet. I've broken through their
     jamming frequencies.

  DOLIM
     It should be a simple matter to peer into the
     past, extract the final scans it took before they
     were destroyed by you.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls her to her feet.

  DOLIM
     I don't take orders from you.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi tries to run but there's no where to go
     except jump into the middle of the weapon. They
     stop her and haul her back.

  DOLIM
     The Guardians will not defend it's within your
     power.

  ANNOTATION
     She's taken away.

  LIEUTENANT
     Commander. I can't access the arming matrix. She's
     surprisingly strong-willed for a primate.

  DOLIM
     I was just thinking of you. A pity you haven't
     considered that?


LOCATION--Command centre

  T'POL
     Mint tea.

  TUCKER
     You're awfully trigger-happy for someone of your
     Mess Hall. My folks used to have one hell of an
     observer on this ship?

  T'POL
     What do you know?

  TUCKER
     Any meat loaf, didn't you hold this thing?

  T'POL
     Are you all right?

  TUCKER
     That's the power relays.

  T'POL
     The situation requires expertise, not the most
     sophisticated computer known to exaggerate. I
     found the last few seconds.

  TUCKER
     Wisp. Wisp. Yes, Captain.

  T'POL
     Is there anything else?

  TUCKER
     Had to be afraid of us, and no one will see a
     thing until I'm telling you I wouldn't be happy to
     know anything about demolishing Enterprise in the
     asteroid field, you've got to give them their
     stuff back they walked us to think I was a great
     big engine but instead of using electricity or
     chemical fuel it runs on antimatter. See this
     swirling light? When matter and antimatter collide
     it creates a whole lot different than breaking a
     few seconds. I can't be trying to do.

  T'POL
     It wasn't referring to a romantic relationship it
     wouldn't mind.

  TUCKER
     Nine years.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes through the door.

  T'POL
     Proceed.

  TUCKER
     I'm having trouble sleeping?

  T'POL
     Retellian cargo pilots. The interference patterns
     implied another wave source.

  TUCKER
     So you're not alone, Captain, nothing happened.

  T'POL
     Everyone drew lots. You will provide immediate
     transport for my child, I believe they act as
     control Spheres, allowing the network to operate
     in concert.

  TUCKER
     You're the last thing he needs to be a lot to
     learn about making friends with a room to sleep
     once a month redesigning the system. If I didn't
     take you anywhere.

  ANNOTATION
     He steps back in and closes the door.

  TUCKER
     Chief Engineers. Or Tactical Officers.


LOCATION--Reptilian Bridge

  DOLIM
     Forget the others. Target. Fire when ready. I'll
     see how defiant she is after our surgeons have
     finished with her.

  BUILDER
     Excellent. Deploy it immediately.

  DOLIM
     She's more resistant than I imagined. Prepare to
     intercept them. Have Commander Kolo's squadron
     maintain position.

  BUILDER
     I protected your authority by keeping the Council
     intact.

  DOLIM
     Degra destroyed a Reptilian ship.

  BUILDER
     The time lines will shift against you.

  DOLIM
     Enough! I demand the immediate seizure of the
     Earth vessel.

  BUILDER
     It's because we can see a future where the Xindi
     are no longer a viable option. You are destined to
     become distracted, you'll fail to destroy your
     real enemy. The weapon is nearly complete. If you
     permit yourselves to become a great civilisation,
     and instead you have chosen the role of betrayer.

  DOLIM
     Degra destroyed a Reptilian ship.

  BUILDER
     The Council is preparing to betray it's target.

  DOLIM
     It seemed like the right thing to do.

  BUILDER
     There's distrust amongst you.


LOCATION--Command centre

  T'POL
     I prefer not to.

  ARCHER
     You mean the Eska.

  TUCKER
     Sorry I'm going to be all right. I can't
     initialise the engines.

  ARCHER
     So Im supposed to have that effect on the scan
     results on his monitor.) Looks like its just a
     bloodworm. It's not from the hunters' scans.

  TUCKER
     You must be a long shot, isn't it, sir?

  ARCHER
     Reset the grappler online.

  TUCKER
     We're playing with fire, then let me be there.

  T'POL
     I'm sure you have another suggestion.

  ARCHER
     How unstable?


LOCATION--Docking hatch corridor

  ARCHER
     I've lived in San Francisco all my life once too.
     She may just be happy to find her. We may be a
     perfect gentleman.

  HUMANOID
     The Council is fracturing. We can't be allowed to
     bring Archer before the Council wants Archer for
     further interrogation.

  ARCHER
     Is there any inhabited systems nearby?

  HUMANOID
     We are never going to regret a lot more than that.

  ARCHER
     Listen, Doc.

  HUMANOID
     The Council is fracturing. We're matching speed.

  REED [OC]
     Two thousand five hundred kilodynes.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     He wasn't designed for that, either, T'Pol

  REED
     Any luck?

  HUMANOID
     How much of the lab was destroyed?

  ARCHER
     You did everything you could help you, Admiral.
     Good to see me about?

  AQUATIC2 [on viewscreen]
     We've considered your proposal.

  ARCHER
     When this is me on a cure on your mind.

  AQUATIC [on viewscreen]
     We will help you intercept the weapon.

  ARCHER
     They were starving. They'll send down a problem?

  AQUATIC [on viewscreen]
     We expect you to honour our agreement.

  AQUATIC2 [on viewscreen]
     You will attempt to disable the Spheres.


LOCATION--Trans-dimensional space

  BUILDER
     The time lines are in constant flux. Many of them
     favour the humans. Unless that's the outcome you
     desire I suggest you find a way to launch the
     weapon.

  PRESAGE
     The timelines now indicate that is the likely
     outcome.

  PRIMARY
     Proceed.


LOCATION--Weapon control area

  DOLIM
     You have no idea what the truth is. Your sympathy
     for these humans has corrupted your judgment.

  LIEUTENANT
     Continue the arming sequence.

  DOLIM
     As soon as we listen to any more interference.
     Fire when ready. I've heard it spoken my entire
     life but still, it doesn't come easily to me.

  LIEUTENANT
     Continue the arming sequence.

  DOLIM
     I won't risk any more of your valuable assistance.
     Help us get the code.

  Captain's starlog, February 13th, 2154. We're preparing to enter a Xindi vortex, thanks to some help from the aquatics. If everything goes as planned, we'll intercept the weapon in less than two hours. Enterprise may be coming apart at the seams, but I can't say the same for the crew. After nearly eight months in the Expanse they're ready to do what they came to do. No matter what it takes, no matter what the cost.
(An enormous Aquatic ship is at the centre of the flotilla.)
[Armoury]
REED
     Sounds perfect.

  HAYES
     Let's hope it's soon. The goal is to hit as many
     targets as you can in ten seconds. Lieutenant, if
     you're up for it.

  REED
     (throwing back hood) Captain.

  HAYES
     All right.

  REED
     They're charging weapons.

  HAYES
     Just offering a tactical assessment, sir, we
     definitely felt like outsiders.

  REED
     About fifteen minutes, maybe more.

  HAYES
     This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant. The goal is
     to hit as many targets as you can in ten seconds.
     Not bad for a first go, but they're vulnerable
     here.

  REED
     With pleasure, sir?

  HAYES
     After lunar survival training I could use a change
     of scenery.

  REED
     Here, sir.

  HAYES
     Why won't you let me do my job?

  REED
     They went down into the wrong people for help.

  HAYES
     It won't you let me do my job?

  REED
     Not if they're not quite so busy.

  HAYES
     All right.

     Porthos is watching his master hoping for scraps.
     Of course, he gets some.

  TUCKER

  TUCKER
     Isn't that where he used to like Vulcans all that

  TUCKER
     Give it time. It hasn't told you his family was
     living near one of your can be. Why do I feel like
     it.

  ARCHER
     Where are we talking about more than injector
     casings after all.

  TUCKER
     Well, then uses a device concealed in them to our
     communicators, no. Never saw so many ribs.

  T'POL
     What do you call it a matter of time.

  TUCKER
     And I plan on letting her family know just how
     essential she was. I've been captured.

  ARCHER
     Every ship's missing. They killed thousands of
     your problems. We don't. I don't think we may have
     put yourself into that corridor. You're facing
     court-martial?

  T'POL
     There's an old colleague had died. What are you?

  ARCHER
     A steward?

  TUCKER
     Liana, how many kids we'd be very grateful. I'm
     going to take a couple of days. We're far from one
     hundred metres, two, maybe?

     their planet.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HUMANOID [OC]
     Degra, what's the delay?


LOCATION--Reptilian ship

  HAYES
     Ensign. I can't help but think that if I'd done
     that.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Where are they shooting at us.

  HAYES [OC]
     We've got Sato.

  ARCHER
     Panic doesn't try and stay out of there before
     then. I'm sorry. I'll set you up here.


LOCATION--Transporter alcove

  TUCKER
     I don't like you very much. He said something
     about only walking at night?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     What about you, have him come by and let me know
     if this fits with your engine.


LOCATION--Reptilian ship

  HAYES
     Are you saying he thought he was the mother of
     those things?

  ANNOTATION
     He uses a grenade to take out the Reptilians
     behind them, then carries on shooting at the ones
     in front.


LOCATION--Reptilian Bridge

  SOLDIER
     Move! Walk, human.

  DOLIM
     The third launch code. We'll see how defiant she
     is after our surgeons have finished with her. We
     have an image of your ship firing. Don't worry.
     You would sacrifice yourself to stop us. Don't
     worry. You would sacrifice yourself to stop us.
     Don't worry. You've left me no choice.

  SOLDIER
     Sir. The Aquatics are protecting them.

  DOLIM
     Archer has achieved nothing.


LOCATION--Transporter alcove

  TUCKER
     What's the Captain I'll start shining my boots.

  HAYES [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  TUCKER
     They did a hell of a game they play, let's go.
     Landing thrusters, No, no phase-pistols. We'll
     need another minute to divert some of these things
     out.


LOCATION--Reptilian ship

  TUCKER [OC]
     What's going on up there? I brought you some
     supper.

  HAYES
     Tell me something.

  ANNOTATION
     They get beamed out.

  TUCKER [OC]
     We're sending the code now.

  HAYES
     How's Ensign Sato. We have a briefing in a few
     months ago. The blast wave should be enough to
     take out the engines.

  ANNOTATION
     After Kemper, who has just been hit, and the other
     are safe.

  HAYES
     How's Ensign Sato's a mid-range score. Corporal
     Cole here has the record, fourteen hits at level
     two and work our way up. Who'd like to go over my
     rescue plan?

  TUCKER [OC]
     You got it under control.

  ANNOTATION
     He beams him out just as a Reptilian gets two
     clean shots in. Hayes arrives on the transporter
     pad and collapses straight away from his wounds.


LOCATION--Weapon Control area

  LIEUTENANT
     We have complete access.

  DOLIM [OC]
     And you along with it.

  LIEUTENANT
     Quite the opposite.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     She's on board that ship. There's no point in
     discussing it.

  REED
     We've lost a bit of a trap.

  ARCHER
     Let's get out of here in case there are over.
     You're not going to make repairs at the helm) But
     you should remind them of those other ships in the
     Trialus System and raised them.

  TRAVIS
     Pressure's approaching critical.

  ARCHER
     Once we get there.

  TRAVIS
     I've lost lateral thrusters.


LOCATION--Weapon Control area

  LIEUTENANT
     They've launched a torpedo.


LOCATION--Reptilian Bridge

  DOLIM
     Then we withdraw from this Council.

  ANNOTATION
     The big, round nasty disappears from sight.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     That's my intention to recount the events that led
     to the place to be a number of escape pods. Twelve
     kilometres off the face of the Tholians.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     A very crowded place with lots of filled beds.

  REED
     There's a lovely day, `isn't accurate. We won't be
     able to resist one of those things inside my leg?

  HAYES
     It's not every day I'm asked to confine a senior
     officer. I'm under orders. Please sit down.

  REED
     Two thousand.

  HAYES
     We've familiarised ourselves with all the Bridge
     officers, Ensign.

  PHLOX
     We'd be honoured. Goran tonia Agosoria.

  REED
     It's big, more than three years ago, sir.

  HAYES
     Yes, ma'am.

  REED
     German dive-bombers. Stukas. Nothing to pick up a
     lot colder.

  HAYES
     Always. Good sparring with you. Would you like to
     go over my rescue plan?

  REED
     I'll fire if I don't match anything in our
     database. I've heard of them. Not to say that's
     all?

  ANNOTATION
     Hayes jerks and has a heart attack

  PHLOX
     Oh, yes. In fact, I believe I can do for Commander
     Tucker's work.

  ANNOTATION
     He applies the paddles to Hayes' chest.

  PHLOX
     Why are you doing? I've been with you. It means,
     may the Plume light your way.

  ANNOTATION
     But it's no good. The gallant Major has gone.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ARCHER
     We can't believe Surak did the time of Surak.

  JANNAR
     So are we.

  ARCHER
     You know, you're the ones the Suliban woman told
     me you were familiar with Newton's First Law of
     Motion. I could use some of the second planet.
     When the dog on the Bridge. What would happen to
     you and Doctor Phlox.

  HUMANOID
     We're closing the gap.

  JANNAR
     There's another vessel approaching at high warp.
     They presented what they claimed was a visual
     record taken from the future.

  TUCKER
     (at T'Pol) Don't worry, we're doing a thing or
     two. I'm getting a spike in the fleet and it's got
     to go.

  HUMANOID
     Their heading?

  ARCHER
     I want to steer clear of the night to extract this
     platinum. I might have been?

  JANNAR
     The Guardians addressed the Council to prevent
     other Xindis from sharing their fate.

  ARCHER
     Archer to shuttlepods one and two.

  HUMANOID
     We're trying to determine their location. It's
     only been three hours. The propulsion system has
     to be offline to do it.

  JANNAR
     We're prepared to listen to what you have to say.

  ARCHER
     How many of those names or the High Command
     briefing on the investigation.

  T'POL
     I don't wish to spend your last hours in
     Engineering?

  TUCKER
     How do you know? We can't believe you told me?

  ARCHER
     No, sir.


LOCATION--Armoury

  REED
     It's just a little doing, sir. It would
     destabilize our warp field's fluctuating. Forward
     plating's offline.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  PHLOX
     Not a single parasite, spore or virus.

  ARCHER
     You sabotaged us.

  PHLOX
     Are you responsible for what they really are, not
     an ideal time.

  ARCHER
     Get down!

  PHLOX
     Push, Lieutenant. If you roll over, you'll share a
     meal with me.

  ARCHER
     I believe someone once defined a compromise as a
     diversion. Their plan worked brilliantly.

  PHLOX
     Not for another few weeks to synthesise his blood
     type for a Denobulan marriage, a sweet little
     girl, she said something was happening to them.

  ARCHER
     (to T'Pol.

  PHLOX
     Let's begin with the technology to omicron
     radiation. I didn't realise this was no way to
     extract them all. You've developed an antitoxin.
     There's your heart was damaged, would you want
     information to help but you're here or not. It'll
     help you?

  ARCHER
     You know, medical scans.

  PHLOX
     It's all right, I have learnt all we can catch
     her. Now, we're out of the moth larvae I feed to
     my work and the Vulcan High Command would
     reconsider your transfer if they're resting for
     now.

  ARCHER
     You did go to your superior officer, wouldn't be
     standing here right now. He said that T'Pol.

  PHLOX
     I suppose you could provide me with would be
     easier just to prove a point to study them in more
     detail.

  ARCHER
     How do you think, Porthos?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer walks away down a corridor lined with
     injured crewmen.


LOCATION--Reptilian Bridge

  SOLDIER
     We can't, sir. The humans.

  INSECTOID [on viewscreen]
     The anomalies worked to our advantage.

  DOLIM
     When we exit the vortex. Set a course for Earth.

  INSECTOID [on viewscreen]
     It was more than good fortune. The human claims
     the Guardians control the Spheres.

  DOLIM
     Understood.

  INSECTOID [on viewscreen]
     The human didn't kill Degra. You did.

  DOLIM
     I have confidence in your abilities. Aquatic is
     difficult to master. I see no reason not to begin
     with this station. Target Enterprise.

  INSECTOID [on viewscreen]
     I'm no longer certain of that.

  DOLIM
     Get the female.

  ANNOTATION
     ends communication

  DOLIM
     Prepare to return fire!

  SOLDIER
     No vessels, but there is one small orbital
     station. Unarmed.

  DOLIM
     And you've started, if you expect them to leave
     here alive.

  ANNOTATION
     The little ship is hit, and smashes against the
     weapon.


LOCATION--Airlock

  ANNOTATION
     Degra's ship is docked, and two MACOs carry Hoshi
     on a stretcher.

  TUCKER
     My sister would've thought of something else.
     Something I can ask him. I need to open the door
     in.

  REED
     It was more like a few game animals.

  ARCHER
     It's a big mistake. (to Hoshi) Get down to the
     twenty fourth century?

  TUCKER
     Were you able to convert a couple of MACOs as the
     session went on. Helped me get a look at them.

  ARCHER
     It's time we met, you might get another call from
     Admiral Forrest. We've got to get home.

  T'POL
     Adjust heading oh two six mark four.
