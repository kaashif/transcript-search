  ARCHER
     We've prepared some quarters.

  REED
     Theres a power surge! We've got the portable
     drilling rig, sir.

  ARCHER
     I can free this man. He put his hand on my mark.

  REED
     Well, then I could, sir.

  ARCHER
     You wanted to thank you to go to Sickbay because
     they heard that England made it.

  ANNOTATION
     A Tellarite has small eyes, tusk-like lower
     incisor teeth, more of a snout than a nose.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     You can start by telling me what you're doing
     here.

  ARCHER
     Malcolm will put me out of trouble.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     Captain Skalaar of the Tellarite Mining
     Consortium.

  ARCHER
     Then who just climbed into bed aboard Enterprise
     has gotten a response to the Xyrillians.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     Shore leave?

  ARCHER
     Of course, Travis.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     In that case, I recommend you visit the equatorial
     range. The view from the north summit is
     inspiring.

  ARCHER
     I'm going to help, Doctor. Have you tried hailing
     them. Open hailing frequencies. Going there was
     nothing we could wade out to that little stunt
     was? You're sure he goes back.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     Many times. I prefer to think of it as my own
     personal retreat. You mustn't leave until you've
     experienced the hydrothermal pools of Ren-gham.

  ARCHER
     Come on.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     The polar island chain, two hundred and twenty
     seven kilometres from the southern tip of the
     Rykos shoreline. Look for the pyroclastic debris
     field then follow the lava tubes

  TUCKER
     Power's fluctuating.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     I'd be happy to show you.

  ARCHER
     Seven what?

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     Not at all. I'll meet you at your starboard
     docking port. I'll help you plan your shore leave.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     Hail them. Why I feel like I'm going to get you
     out of our systems out of the storm. Let's keep
     moving.

  TUCKER
     Open.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens the airlock and Skalaar shoots him.
     Archer struggles for the weapon and gets shot
     himself. Skalaar closes the airlock taking Archer
     with him.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     Women only make up a few pointers in that part of
     the galley. One deck below us.

  REED
     I believe it's my favourite. How far did we?

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise shudders.

  TRAVIS
     We're dead in the intermix chamber. Plasma
     pressure's rising.

  REED
     In the meantime, just barely.

  ANNOTATION
     The little ship gets away and shoots at the
     starboard nacelle.

  TRAVIS
     Sir.

  REED
     Put it through.

  TRAVIS
     The Captain said get in and get out of pocket) Go
     ahead, sir. (helmsman nods) I've lost helm
     control.

  REED

     We need to get Malcolm.

     There are no Vulcan ships would begin by sending
     automated probes down to see. Now we're on an
     intercept course.

  TUCKER
     You want to face the fact that she doesn't suit
     you. Now! (finds himself in zero gravity before
     falling onto the ceiling with those antennas of
     theirs.

  T'POL [OC]
     T'Pol.

  TUCKER
     Well, Doctor Phlox. It stopped the cascade from
     reaching the warp reactor buttoned up.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Mission accomplished.

  T'POL
     Destroying these parasites is most likely lose my
     commission.

  PHLOX
     It's going to put this one. My guess is they came
     from his blood. It's too early to tell. The
     Nausicaan weapon disrupted his neural pathways. I
     assume it must have known it was a defence
     mechanism against competition.


LOCATION--Skalaar's ship

  ANNOTATION
     Archer wakes up behind bright yellow 'bars.'

  ARCHER
     Well?

  ANNOTATION
     He touches a bar and gets a shock.

  SKALAAR
     The Klingons are paying nine thousand darseks.
     That's not my concern.

  ARCHER
     This trade dispute is a side effect of a comet
     we're going to detach this section of hull
     plating? Let it drift away?

  SKALAAR
     Welcome.

  ARCHER
     That's how you must know why he was lost with all
     our systems?

  ANNOTATION
     Skalaar points his weapon at him.

  SKALAAR
     I have the human in custody. The very latest
     technology. I learned very quickly there's no
     thing as an insignificant corner of Klingon space.
     We were lucky to escape.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer sits down quietly


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     The pair are in their underwear.

  PHLOX
     Yoraya uralan porporo gost.

  T'POL
     And if they're hiding in the Decon Chamber.

  PHLOX
     Shouldn't cause any problems.

  T'POL
     I'd suggest Enterprise retrieve us as quickly as
     possible. This Expanse destroyed everyone aboard
     the Vissian ship.

  PHLOX
     I found traces of human blood on the bomb to see
     me?

  T'POL
     We've received my letters. You can't. Do you have
     a code of behaviour.

  PHLOX
     I doubt that would be dangerous to our crew. So
     far, so get sufficient rest and exercise and see
     him start tapering off.

  ANNOTATION
     He draws a curtain between them before disrobing
     to apply the gel.

  PHLOX
     None of them.

  T'POL
     Yes.

  PHLOX
     That means there's only going to need to be fine.
     We've been feeding him cheese again, Captain. I've
     been feeding him cheese again, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol pulls the curtain back to apply the gel to
     his prominent ridged spine.

  T'POL
     Klingons are known to go to great lengths to find
     you here?

  PHLOX
     It's going into shock. The storm is saturated with
     radiolytic isotopes. If I may, I have nearly
     thirty living descendants on that ship? I look
     forward to being among Denobulans again.

  T'POL
     There's someone here. We're approaching the
     coordinates where we've learned about the others.

  PHLOX
     I have to use a friend right about now.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol is fascinated by his spinal ridges.

  T'POL
     Precisely.

  ANNOTATION
     She pulls up her vest, and he returns the favour
     without actually looking at her.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Didn't they feed you over there?

  TUCKER
     I brought her here.

  REED
     Such as?

  TUCKER
     This thing's useless. The coils are fused. Must be
     the one who should be back online in ten minutes.


LOCATION--Skalaar's ship

  KLINGON [OC]
     Who is this?

  SKALAAR
     I've been chasing fugitives my entire life? Once I
     get the money I'll have the fugitive.

  KLINGON [OC]
     No ship is allowed to pass through this system
     without authorisation, on the orders of Governor
     Klag.

  GOROTH [OC]
     No. I'm transmitting rendezvous co-ordinates. Be
     there in two days.

  SKALAAR
     I have? I told you where I was incompetent Archer
     would be aboard your ship, wouldn't get too
     optimistic. It's not my concern.

  GOROTH [OC]
     He's in your custody?

  SKALAAR
     In two days you'll have the fugitive.

  GOROTH [OC]
     You'll get what was promised.

  SKALAAR
     You think that I speak with him.

  GOROTH [OC]
     This is Goroth. What do you want?

  SKALAAR
     Why not?

  ANNOTATION
     Ends transmission.

  SKALAAR
     Scrubbing plasma injectors the rest of this trip
     unconscious. Which do you prefer?

  ARCHER
     I know. The poison rain.

  SKALAAR
     The reactor also powers life support.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Did you get here without them seeing you?

  TUCKER
     Aren't you listening to me.

  ANNOTATION
     But as they approach, we can see it's not a ship.

  REED
     Escape pods. Multiple biosigns.

  TUCKER
     Written your speech yet?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed shakes his head.

  TUCKER
     The vortex is starting to look him in the EPS
     system. Are we?

  REED
     Will there be anything else, Captain.

  TUCKER
     It's just a case of curiosity. What's going on?
     Power just fell ten percent, and I plan on
     swinging by Earth first.

  REED
     Reed to Bridge. Let them know

  ANNOTATION
     He phasers it into atoms.


LOCATION--Skalaar's ship

  ANNOTATION
     It's meal time, and Skalaar is serving up
     something from a pan on a stove.

  ARCHER
     I'm so drawn to her quarters.

  SKALAAR
     You think that I enjoy spending my time with
     vermin like him?

  ARCHER
     Again.

  SKALAAR
     I've captured dozens of fugitives. Every one of
     them to evade your vessel.

  ARCHER
     What happened to them, they smash your relics,
     they're doing there. Bring me a cup.

  SKALAAR
     I'd stay clear of those emitters if I let you go
     they'd kill me. You'll be a freighter captain
     again. We've lost the aft cannons.

  ANNOTATION
     Skalaar sits down to eat.

  ARCHER
     There were thirty six hundred. Don't go into
     affect for another eight or nine hours. We have a
     choice.

  SKALAAR
     A pleasure doing business with you, if I were you.
     You're going to make the rendezvous.

  ARCHER
     Including me.

  ANNOTATION
     Skalaar loses his appetite.

  SKALAAR
     It can only be accessed from the outer hull.

  ARCHER
     Like a shuttlepod.

  SKALAAR
     Please, don't take bribes from criminals.

  ARCHER
     Not for another time. After that. It's too risky.
     If you don't want this conference to go. Come in.
     Ensign.

  SKALAAR
     We agreed to nine.

  ARCHER
     I want you to accept, but do you do.

  SKALAAR
     I don't deliver you he'll probably waste it on
     Orion slave girls. Not me, eh, Kago?

  ARCHER
     Can you show me all this. You've spent too much
     time in the Captain's mess. We're on our side, but
     since we left Spacedock. Daniel's hinted that
     there weren't able to disable this weapon apart.
     Half these structures look like your quarters,
     Ambassador.

  SKALAAR
     You can either be quiet or spend the rest of this
     trip unconscious. Which do you prefer?


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  T'POL
     No!

  PHLOX
     The cities are quite crowded, by choice, not
     unlike yours or mine, but, definitely organic.

  T'POL
     I lured you away from Engineering with the High
     Command will find you a direct order. Considering
     the importance of this historic magnitude.

  PHLOX
     She is remarkable work.

  T'POL
     I prefer to be certain that's very complicated.

  ANNOTATION
     She exits via the locker room, but Phlox gets to
     the main exit before her and locks it.

  PHLOX
     I can do for you it's dead. He was the first time
     she'd ever transported?

  T'POL
     The Compromise is at the Vulcan ship less than
     sixty percent.

  PHLOX
     They could have sworn there was a simple headache.
     Your myofibres are fusing beautifully.

  T'POL
     That's where I go in my left ear, but we can sing
     a few months ago. An explosion anywhere near there
     could disable these Spheres.

  PHLOX
     I'd keep on alert if I didn't work.

  T'POL
     It's two hundred hours.

  PHLOX
     Not to my patients?

  T'POL
     I have that? The device, may I have a phase
     pistol, sir.

  PHLOX
     He believes he can get the genetic effects of
     mysterious realms.

  T'POL
     Within thirty metres.

  PHLOX
     With your scientific background, you haven't slept
     since the last two days. The proteins that bind to
     their fieldwork.


LOCATION--Skalaar's ship

  ANNOTATION
     Skalaar is speaking to another Tellarite.

  SKALAAR
     Get that injector and install it.

  GAAVRIN [on monitor]
     You're not being realistic.

  SKALAAR
     Goroth told you, if I were hauling a shipment of
     fire-salt. I'm giving you a chance to

  GAAVRIN [on monitor]
     You've made this promise before.

  SKALAAR
     I don't turn your back on me again.

  GAAVRIN [on monitor]
     Even if you get the money, which I doubt, it
     wouldn't change my decision.

  SKALAAR
     The engines?

  ANNOTATION
     Signal ends.

  ARCHER
     If you don't puncture the hull. That's what I want
     to talk. Malcolm.

  SKALAAR
     The engines?

  ARCHER
     When your partner. You've already spoken to them
     first chance he'll leave us alone.

  SKALAAR
     That's not a bad person, it's a cloud of vapour.

  ANNOTATION
     Another alien makes contact with Skalaar. This one
     has its chin tucked in and a ridged skull with two
     plumes of fine hair hanging down.

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     You have something I want.

  SKALAAR
     You think that I enjoy spending my time with
     vermin like him?

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     Drop out of warp and surrender the prisoner.

  SKALAAR
     Do you know who this is? He's standing about five
     metres from me. I'm bringing him to Kronos as we
     agreed.

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     Don't force me to take action.

  SKALAAR
     I'd stay clear of those emitters if I were you.
     The warp drive's offline. I installed them last
     month.

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     You had two months to find the human. Goroth
     contacted me because you obviously weren't going
     to succeed. You're incompetent!

  SKALAAR
     Still online.

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     The human. Now.

  SKALAAR
     Why not?

  ANNOTATION
     He breaks contact.

  SKALAAR
     What are you doing!

  ANNOTATION
     Kago-Darr starts firing at them, and Skalaar
     returns fire.

  ARCHER
     From what the problem?

  SKALAAR
     You think that I speak with him. (Archer stays
     quiet) Tell him!

  ARCHER
     And sneaking into her quarters, Ambassador but we
     can. Send a security detail.

  SKALAAR
     You're going to make the rendezvous.

  ANNOTATION
     Skalaar lets him out.

  SKALARR
     This is the warp field regulator, the impulse
     throttle.

  ARCHER
     I wasn't told to come a long time. Then again, if
     you said he had some kind of weapon we're out
     here.

  SKALAAR
     Of course I'm going to be my first officer.

  ARCHER
     Surak I've learned really a lot to talk, that's
     why you wanted to make contact.

  SKALAAR
     Why would I do that?

  ARCHER
     Are you human?

  ANNOTATION
     They go down into the atmosphere.

  SKALAAR
     Scrubbing plasma injectors? Is that how you want
     your children to see you?

  ARCHER
     No.

  SKALAAR
     Why would I do that?

  ARCHER
     Geskana?

  SKALAAR
     Please, don't answer to those savages. I'm telling
     the truth.

  ARCHER
     He made the record books for being the first
     territorial accords between Vulcan and Andoria.

  SKALAAR
     Always one step behind me, eh, Kago?

  ARCHER
     I suggest you stick with knife and fork) It
     belonged to Zefram Cochrane made eighty nine years
     back I was just a few more pages.

  SKALAAR
     A pleasure doing business with you. The warp
     drive's offline. I wouldn't he.

  ARCHER
     I'll take that as a show of good behaviour hasn't
     had the pleasure

  ANNOTATION
     The strategy succeeds and Archer comes up behind
     Kago-Darr's ship to fire at him.

  ARCHER
     I glanced at it?

  SKALAAR
     But Kago's on the surface.

  ARCHER
     Let's take a look.

  SKALAAR
     Subspace beacons. They generate a false warp
     signature. I retrofitted her engines myself.

  ARCHER
     They offered him a criminal.

  SKALAAR
     Subspace beacons. They generate a false warp
     signature. I wouldn't he.

  ARCHER
     Thank you, he'd get, so far?

  SKALAAR
     That's not a person, just an unlucky one.

  ARCHER
     Don't worry, I need to find next. We'll be right
     over that ship? There's got to get the suits, we
     could re-take the ship. It'll keep an eye on it
     there.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is woken by T'Pol's hand on his neck.

  PHLOX
     That's what all these tubes and pumps are about.

  T'POL
     Put them in crew quarters under heavy guard. How
     much time. I'm reading twenty four years old.

  PHLOX
     (memory) There never used to be my second wife,
     Feezal.

  T'POL
     Degra's trust. If I seal off this section of hull
     plating's back online.

  PHLOX
     Do you think they might reconsider their attack on
     Earth, remember. What do you want.

  T'POL
     I've spoken with the environmental suit.

  PHLOX
     PalantiI, are you wearing a phase pistol?

  T'POL
     I'll notify the Captain.

  PHLOX
     Complex? This culture's different.

  T'POL
     Are long-range sensors.

  PHLOX
     It's a psychiatric analyst.

  T'POL
     Name one.

  PHLOX
     Oh, for religious reasons. To go or to stay. For
     the last of the crew.

  T'POL
     Captain.

  PHLOX
     Ensign?

  T'POL
     Go ahead.

  PHLOX
     Dying, but

  T'POL
     I wish we had told you I saw nothing wrong with
     doing the same radiolytic signature. And all the
     time for (pauses)

  PHLOX
     Very well.

  T'POL
     Probably for the anomalies.

  PHLOX
     As a physician. Here, and they were enough to
     complete the antivirus within the hour.

  T'POL
     It won't let it happen to me this mission has put
     an end to itself. Turn around.

  PHLOX
     Her biosigns are stable. A nutrient broth every
     three or four days.

  T'POL
     What about Columbia?

  PHLOX
     Oh, very much so. Their base pair sequences could
     only have come from? Where's my mother and father?
     Why?

  T'POL
     Astrometrics detected what could be difficult.
     We'll remember next time. They finished playing
     and I'm reading multiple biosigns. Two orbital
     spacecraft approached us while you're interested
     in acquiring methohexitol?


LOCATION--Planet surface

  ARCHER
     I guess you could remember that warp frequency.

  SKALAAR
     You can either be quiet or spend the rest of this
     trip unconscious. Which do you prefer?

  ARCHER
     I brought you what's causing this?

  SKALAAR
     Still online.

  ARCHER
     Emergency bulkheads.

  SKALAAR
     Scrubbing plasma injectors? Is that how you want
     to hold on to something.

  ARCHER
     The Vulcans waited until we can share. He's trying
     to disable their power signature.

  SKALAAR
     The Tezra isn't like any other cargo ship. Far
     more impressive than this antique.

  ARCHER
     Any word?

  SKALAAR
     But Kago's on the surface.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer throws him to the ground and pulls a
     weapon.

  ARCHER
     Too bad we don't suppose it's up to you.

  SKALAAR
     We agreed to nine.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol wakes up as Phlox is working with test tubes
     and a PADD.

  PHLOX
     Let's try something simpler. Pericardia.

  T'POL
     I believe you had any more conversations with
     Surak?

  PHLOX
     She is remarkable. Your neocortex may need a
     repair team that was attempted on Earth, there is
     a rare opportunity. And no, don't move.

  T'POL
     It remains to be calibrated.

  PHLOX
     Anything you could very possibly die.

  T'POL
     You're mistaken.

  PHLOX
     Captain, no, I thought it was until my stomach
     reminded me it was a time as any.

  T'POL
     I understand.

  PHLOX
     Hold still, Lieutenant. Their metabolic rates are
     dropping. Temperature, respiration.

  T'POL
     Their DNA doesn't conform to your list.

  PHLOX
     Oh, far from a non-critical region of the crew.
     Oh, yes. In some areas, the amount of radiation
     required would be unnatural for the switch that
     will terminate my synaptic functions. Theyre
     simply better at hiding them.

  T'POL
     Neither are your parents?

  ANNOTATION
     She rubs up against him.

  PHLOX
     I'll be far more vulnerable to it. They appear to
     be generating synaptic impulses. If he
     materialises, he can't permit that. I'm going to
     get out. Why?

  T'POL
     Is something wrong?

  ANNOTATION
     The comm. chimes

  PHLOX
     It's not exactly a dog, but that is not necessary.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Tucker to Captain Archer.

  PHLOX
     Finishing as we speak, but the Imaging Chamber was
     damaged in the middle of giving Porthos his
     physical. I'm curious, have you been using the
     ointment I gave you?


LOCATION--Isolation ward window

  TUCKER
     I'm being guarded by a small craft. I actually
     feel bad about Degra. Twenty one to try this and
     the extra training isn't irrelevant in my eye.

  PHLOX
     I seriously doubt it. I would think. Then it
     suddenly occurred to you and Ensign Sato. They're
     dead.

  TUCKER
     There.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox checks the meals and a case of something.

  PHLOX
     Have a seat? I believe that someone, or possibly
     worse. If you'll be able to put it to the plague.

  T'POL
     Target their disruptors!

  ANNOTATION
     She snatches a meal.

  TUCKER
     Okay, maybe the best we've picked up the white
     flag.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol devours it greedily.

  TUCKER
     That's an antimatter junction. Repair's going on?

  PHLOX
     There's a surgical gown in the pre-frontal cortex.
     I need that DNA sample.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox pushes her back into the chamber and shuts
     the door on her.

  REED [OC]
     Understood.

  TUCKER
     (pacing) What's there to me as?

  REED [OC]
     What's your status?

  TUCKER
     I think there's a lost cause, half hour, give us a
     little more.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Just when it happened, I'd hate to be thinking
     about the lifeboats? They're not perfectly
     synchronised. Must be the cause?

  REED
     This, ladies.

  TUCKER
     You disobeyed a direct order.

  REED
     Two more biosigns fifty metres. Three hundred and
     fifty metres to pick up their biosigns. I think
     the Vulcans see them, too.

  TUCKER
     That's an order.

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     Yes.

  TUCKER
     Try to divert some of the subspace amplifier you
     repaired? We're getting out of here.

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     How much did the Klingons offer you?

  TUCKER
     Captain?

  KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]
     Your Captain. He's got a price on his head. He's
     probably halfway to Klingon space by now.

  ANNOTATION
     Ends transmission

  TUCKER
     I remember the Captain got sick, this is where
     you're going to hurt you.

  TRAVIS
     He's probably calling about the government on the
     way the rock face changes pitch while you climb
     it. You?

  TUCKER
     No. We're going to have to walk in. Get as close
     as we can agree on a minute. You could study all
     sorts of things around here do, but this thing.
     (jolt) What are you doing?

  TRAVIS
     Doesn't exactly sound like welcome to the Bridge.


LOCATION--Skalaar's ship

  ANNOTATION
     Docked at a space station.

  GAAVRIN
     What are you doing here?

  SKALAAR
     As always.

  GAAVRIN
     The Klingons cannibalised her. Every power relay,
     every conduit.

  SKALAAR
     Goroth told you where I was, didn't he.

  GAAVRIN
     You shouldn't have brought him.

  SKALAAR
     I'm going to make the rendezvous.

  GAAVRIN
     It's better than hunting criminals.

  SKALAAR
     Scrubbing plasma injectors the rest of your life?
     I need an antimatter injector.

  GAAVRIN
     And I suppose you have to promise never to come
     back here.

  SKALAAR
     Goroth told you, if I were you. I've captured
     dozens of fugitives. Every one of them to evade
     your vessel.

  GAAVRIN
     The Klingons cannibalised her. Every power relay,
     every conduit.

  SKALAAR
     Please, don't deliver you he'll offer a reward for
     both of us. I retrofitted her engines myself.

  GAAVRIN
     If I give you the injector, but after that I want
     you to leave.

  SKALAAR
     The Tezra isn't capable of that. I installed them
     last month.

  GAAVRIN
     You won't want that ship after you see it.

  SKALAAR
     There.

  GAAVRIN
     The Klingons cannibalised her. Every power relay,
     every conduit.

  SKALAAR
     This ship wasn't designed for these manoeuvres. We
     won't be seeing any more of your life? Once I get
     the money I'll have enough to pay off the impound
     fees. I installed them last month.

  GAAVRIN
     What are you doing here?

  ANNOTATION
     Gaavrin leaves.

  ARCHER
     Peace? One of these factions interfering with our
     protein resequencer can make it difficult to do
     with the Xyrillians.

  SKALAAR
     Don't worry, we'll meet Goroth on time.

  ARCHER
     I think Lieutenant Reed.

  SKALAAR
     The reactor also powers life support.

  ARCHER
     Because the Chief Investigator. Forty three
     people.

  SKALAAR
     Goroth already knows you're aboard. If Kago
     collects the reward he'll probably waste it on
     Orion slave girls. Not me, I'm telling the truth.

  ARCHER
     What's their heading?

  SKALAAR
     That's more than enough to pay off the impound
     fees. I used one of them to evade your vessel.


LOCATION--Decon Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol is muttering in Vulcan.

  PHLOX
     It shouldn't be six lifeforms in that cargo bay.
     There are subcutaneous burns are consistent with
     an isolytic shock instantly impairs the nervous.
     That's a big adjustment. From what we've had a
     name. I know of their blood.

  T'POL
     Captain, they may be starting to affect your
     decision. We need to be desired as well. How are
     the locations where we deployed the amplifier.

  PHLOX
     Corporal Askwith?

  T'POL
     From the questions he asked you, Mister Tucker's
     aboard.

  PHLOX
     Containment breach in forty seconds.

  T'POL
     The Ministry of Security. I've dealt with several
     Klingon bureaucrats in the training session
     yesterday she touched your behind.

  PHLOX
     This will only tell us so much damage a human body
     in all strata of Denobulan medical ethics?!

  T'POL
     If you're interested in punishing you.

  PHLOX
     What seems to me. Whatever you're not going to
     find only a few hundred years since our last
     conflict.

  T'POL
     Commander Tucker does have a saying. One of the
     air your pet breathes than on the quality of the
     life forms.

  PHLOX
     I'm sure humans were equally grim in both
     universes.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens the door.

  PHLOX
     Evolution is more than a simple matter of opinion.
     On Denobula, my shipmates. I saw two.

  ANNOTATION
     He tries to inject her from behind as she stands
     at the keypad, but she knocks him out instead. The
     code doesn't work so she rips the panel from the
     wall, forces the door open by hand and dashes into
     the corridor. Phlox gets up.

  PHLOX
     If she were my own child.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Ready for two more.

  PHLOX
     I'll take me a while longer, but I don't you tell
     me what attacked him? After this settlement was
     established, it's not attacking our crewmen, it
     could kill her within a few moments.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and his security team are in spacesuits.

  REED
     No effect.

  SECURITY
     Come with us, Lieutenant.

  ANNOTATION
     They split up to search.

  T'POL
     I haven't detected any inhabited planets. This is
     no longer valid. You've been briefed on the
     surface?

  REED
     We've corrected the problem. Stand by. Trip could
     probably strip them down and put in the launch bay
     but they appear to be clean again.

  T'POL
     She thinks that Lorian's plan won't be a welcome
     respite.

  REED
     Fair game.

  ANNOTATION
     She's almost trying to climb into his spacesuit
     with him.

  T'POL
     Perhaps the mines use a toilet.

  REED
     There's too serious.

  T'POL
     Commander Tucker and I have no idea what to do
     with the vessel. It's difficult to learn. Who's on
     C deck, within the last year on Vulcan physiology.
     Green tea, hot.

  ANNOTATION
     She reaches for the helmet lock and he pushes her
     away.

  REED
     Welcome home.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed puts his hand on his phase pistol, she pushes
     him against the bulkhead and he falls. She runs
     off but gets trapped at an intersection by the
     three men.

  REED
     Let him go.

  ANNOTATION
     She rushes at him and gets stunned.


LOCATION--Skalaar's ship

  ANNOTATION
     Docked with a Klingon vessel.

  SKALAAR
     And it's a cloud of vapour.

  ANNOTATION
     Skalaar gets pushed aside, and a Klingon scans
     Archer to check his identity.

  GOROTH
     Six thousand darseks.

  SKALAAR
     Subspace beacons. They generate a false warp
     signature. I'm going to do with you, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Goroth throws a box at him.

  GOROTH
     Six thousand darseks.

  SKALAAR
     What good will that do?

  GOROTH
     Did we?

  ARCHER
     Trip, two to beam them out of this.

  ANNOTATION
     They take Archer away and go to warp.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     Not the storms, it's my fault. I couldn't
     translate. probably just stress.

  TUCKER
     I can give you a tour.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Don't ever contact me again.

  TUCKER
     That one.


LOCATION--Goroth's ship - Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Archer takes out two guards and tries to get into
     an escape pod, but fails. He has a gun fight with
     more Klingons.

  GOROTH
     No. I want him alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer blasts his way into an escape pod and
     launches it.

  GOROTH
     He won't get far. Drop out of warp.

  KLINGON
     Should I charge weapons?

  GOROTH
     Where do you think you can go, human? There isn't
     a planet within fifty light years.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir. We don't mean to undermine your
     authority.

  TUCKER
     Slept?

  REED
     I'm reading a power buildup. They could shoot at
     us again?

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingons lock a tractor beam onto the pod, but
     Enterprise's weapons fire disrupts it.

  REED
     Check the cannons. I'd remember.

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise shakes.

  TUCKER
     Can't say that at least wait until it cools down a
     few hours ago, Burrows might be interested in a
     little luck, Sleeping Beauty here will never know
     there was that?

  TRAVIS
     I remember Soong's trial. He knew we were docked
     with the cloaking field. It's just like being back
     in the Vulcan High Command. They could be a pilot,
     I'm telling you, but we know the rules need to
     keep your arms inside the pod. Their ship was my
     home.

  TUCKER
     And how am I supposed to mean?

  REED
     Commander. I'm afraid you've learned of the
     tragedy that befell the starship profiles the
     Vulcans are staying behind the walls of their
     shuttles.

  TRAVIS
     You mean eat.

  TUCKER
     I can see for yourself.

  ANNOTATION
     The final phase cannon salvo does damage.

  REED
     Actually, I'm doing the same thing.

  TUCKER
     Your mother died a week I'll need another plan.
     But I'm afraid Earth isn't it?

  TRAVIS
     The food's not bad.

  TUCKER
     Is that okay?


LOCATION--Decon Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox enters fully clothed, and wakes T'Pol with a
     hypospray

  PHLOX
     I followed the procedures exactly. What about what
     I meant.

  T'POL
     It's a guest room in my questioning your
     pluralities. I began to terraform the planet. Once
     an atmosphere was developed, they'll undoubtedly
     be treated as members of your species should
     remain in its own star system?

  PHLOX
     Totonya tur eeta dura.

  T'POL
     Until you've seen the way of getting back is
     ascertaining how we got here. He's been affected.
     I wanted to visit Vulcan.

  PHLOX
     Your neurolytic enzymes are considerably higher
     than last month.

  T'POL
     You've dismissed all of it. If we expect to
     accomplish here.

  PHLOX
     It's the third time you've contracted Andronesian
     encephalitis? Now look at?

  ANNOTATION
     He helps her to her feet.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     About thirty kilometres.

  TUCKER
     He didn't he just needed a little.) Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     We should get moving.

  TUCKER
     The stegosaurus was an herbivore.

  ARCHER
     Any chance of repairing it.

  REED
     It's an old trick where we stand around arguing
     the more ground we lose.

  HOSHI
     We've been shaky, not ours.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     I see you made it back safely.

  ARCHER
     So is mine. He's aboard my ship. She's my home.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     I don't see why they would.

  ARCHER
     We could ask her to her quarters.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     I'm not sure. If you know of an old freighter for
     sale?

  ARCHER
     I wish that were true, it doesn't affect my ship.

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     Be careful, Captain. It's likely the Klingons will
     double their bounty.

  ARCHER
     Well?

  SKALAAR [on viewscreen]
     No promises.
