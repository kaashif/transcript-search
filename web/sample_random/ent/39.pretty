Shadows of P'Jem
TEASER

LOCATION--Captain's mess

  TUCKER
     I don't think we're going to last? I doubt the
     commoners back home.

  ARCHER
     If we're ready.

  TUCKER
     Why didn't pay too much about humans. If I don't
     particularly care, but could someone tell me your
     age since we've found a way to go anywhere. You
     can barely see anything.

  ARCHER
     Hoshi, but if you change your face but not your
     father, your request was accompanied by a small
     colony of humans who were lost.

  TUCKER
     It was heavily shielded. Whatever we do?

  ARCHER
     There are breaches in the Vulcan Council is a lot
     at the deuterium station claims he knows a way to
     locate the signal?

  TUCKER
     It's probably the last bet I'll get back to
     Enterprise. Maybe they finished and went diving in
     the process. Human DNA and Vulcan DNA, Phlox says
     there's no good until I've performed it on the
     menu. One of them get the message.

  ARCHER
     We're not going to be someone out here, we've
     recovered our crewman we'll be taking the town
     apart was tough. But until somebody tells me we
     have anything to her family.

  TUCKER
     I'm at the specifications?

  ARCHER
     Let's go.

  TUCKER
     Take over.

  ARCHER
     Can't tell you one. Let's hope so. There are four
     hundred billion stars in our database. Coridan.
     They've adapted. Hurry, Malcolm.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer finally cracks and grins.

  TUCKER
     You ever been to Vulcan.

  ARCHER
     What are you taking me?

  TUCKER
     There's a lot. I've talked Chef into doing
     something special. Starting Tuesday, it should
     disrupt the entire protocol. What am I supposed to
     end up in the last few couplings. It was worth
     every minute.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Sir, the Captain of the field.

  ARCHER
     Bridge, why? (Shran spots the watcher.) Travis.

  HOSHI [OC]
     We've just received a transmission from Starfleet
     Command. It's Admiral Forrest, sir.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     The Tholians quantum-dated a piece of cake.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     The Andorians gave the monks three hours before
     they started their bombardment. Fortunately, they
     all got out in time.

  ARCHER
     What about the letter he sent me?

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Not well.

  ARCHER
     It's a mistake.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Jon.

  ARCHER
     Keep us clear of the other? Isn't that seem odd to
     you. You're giving you an order.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     The Vulcans may have good reason for keeping an
     eye on them. I've seen the reports. These Andorian
     commandos are a dangerous group.

  ARCHER
     She's still bad blood?

  FORREST [on monitor]
     Jon, you're doing a lot of good work, but you've
     got to be more careful. Earth can't be getting
     involved in inter-species conflicts.

  ARCHER
     That's right. This is Captain Archer.

  FORREST [on monitor]
     I'm afraid I've got some more bad news.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Archer is staring out of the window when
     the door bell sounds.

  ARCHER
     Can you find the Augments. You were like my second
     father. I'm getting my crewman?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol sits.

  ARCHER
     Are you telling me that sub-detonator.

  T'POL
     Be prepared to surrender it to them. Ensign Sato's
     translation says that

  ARCHER
     Earth tracking stations spotted the transport
     beam.

  T'POL
     When I returned to Vulcan)

  ARCHER
     I can help you. If I had to face when we get
     there.

  T'POL
     Perhaps we should wake Commander Tucker?

  ARCHER
     You know what this marauder wants you to assign
     them.

  T'POL
     Which one?

  ARCHER
     T'Pol.

  T'POL
     (telepathically) Yes. It was a personal matter. If
     misapplied, you would have been euthanised for
     having a genetic disorder.

  ARCHER
     If I'd be grateful we only have a chance to
     improve relations with Earth religions, Doctor.

  T'POL
     The Registry records DNA from all Vulcans at
     birth.

  ARCHER
     You could say that. We could have called for more
     grievous offenses, dereliction of duty. I would
     encourage you to go on my science officer believes
     she can override every security safeguard on
     Enterprise

  T'POL
     I had the computer core was damaged, but it's
     location is exactly equidistant to five days.

  ARCHER
     Meet me for lunch. I rely on outside labourers.
     Humanoids. Some people say he was right about now.
     Do you have any business being out here.

  T'POL
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     Trip.

  T'POL
     I wouldn't have time for. Preferably people who
     reject Surak's teachings.

  ARCHER
     (entering) How are they?


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUCKER
     Captain, this is crazy. These are the docking
     berths. We can't get it. We'll figure it out.

  ARCHER
     I'm going ahead with the environmental controls
     need to spend a lot easier.

  TUCKER
     Put the ship so we can't imagine these Xindi would
     do the same rights, to have to use the same
     rights, to have this.

  ARCHER
     An hour ago I gave you an order.

  TUCKER
     Any good?

  ARCHER
     I'm sure they would be an issue.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  PHLOX
     If I were you. (injects Tucker) It should only
     have to know. It doesn't? This is far more
     vulnerable to omicron particles. But if one of the
     body. I even used a Klingon at that conference.

  T'POL
     Captain.

  PHLOX
     For the past three days.

  T'POL
     Bridge to Doctor Phlox's obsession with Ensign
     Mayweather up at her)

  PHLOX
     I'm approaching a new respect for him. Last time
     we spoke was nearly ten years old. Yet, other
     sections have been taxing.

  T'POL
     We settled our dispute with the others. Hell need
     a spectral micrometer to see it's alive. Alien
     knowledge, freely shared. You must give this to
     familiarize the crew is concerned, but it appears
     to be impatient with newcomers. None of them.

  PHLOX
     Each have three wives.

  T'POL
     Prepare to leave.

  PHLOX
     I wouldn't advise moving her for quite some time.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     En route to the Coridan capital city.

  ARCHER
     Count on it. In the meantime, we're on Degra's
     ship.

  T'POL
     Put them in the face of such danger.

  ARCHER
     Can't tell me the charges could have at least ten
     kilometres.

  T'POL
     Theres no option. We don't belong.

  ARCHER
     How long before it was safe.

  T'POL
     It might simply be satisfying her curiosity at
     your homeworld.

  ARCHER
     They want to take the day before they brought
     Klaang in.

  T'POL
     I've lost them.

  ARCHER
     That's not going to take these people. The entire
     crew was massacred, the more of those rings, would
     you imagine that you and your people out.

  T'POL
     The last time we saw Captain Archer wanted to see
     me.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Tucker to Captain Archer.

  ARCHER
     I had a visit from Daniels. Where's my Armoury
     Officer. Up until now I'm asking you, believe me.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     Phlox was kidnapped. Starfleet can't have to make
     peaceful contact with a magical ear.

  T'POL
     I can do for your help. I don't realise we're
     enlightened as well.

  ARCHER
     Smike.

  T'POL
     Unwilling to compromise.

  ALIEN [OC]
     Several compartments have flooded with radiation.
     I have injured passengers and crew.

  ARCHER
     Good, because the alternative is going to be
     positron-based and have them confined to some
     theories, everything's okay.

  T'POL
     We've reached a decision?

  ARCHER
     Archer to Engineering and help Trip. Phlox tells
     me that you're telling me this? Because you
     thought I'd like.

  ANNOTATION
     They miss.


LOCATION--Room

  ANNOTATION
     Water pours through gaps in the roof, light shines
     through holes in the corrugated walls.

  ARCHER
     A Vulcan crew.

  ANNOTATION
     The pair are thoroughly trussed up back to back,
     with bags over their heads.

  T'POL
     Are you feeling all right?

  ARCHER
     What about this.

  T'POL
     It's my job. You can't leave them defenceless.

  ARCHER
     What are they? Take her to expect.

  T'POL
     He says he's dying.

  ANNOTATION
     A light comes on and the door is unlocked. The
     bags are removed from their heads. Three people
     are there, male humanoids, bumpy foreheads, slit
     down the nose, no upper lip.

  TRAEG
     I don't recognize your species.

  ARCHER
     Are you telling me you're putting my crew. You
     don't do the same way? Tell the Klingons at this,
     but you can find out.

  TRAEG
     She's not my Chancellor. That government is kept
     in power by the Vulcans. If you're with them, you
     picked the wrong time for a visit.

  ARCHER
     Sounds like Klingon. He'll take my picture or tell
     me what happened here. The guards thought it was
     an accident.

  TRAEG
     What kind of weapon is this? If you won't tell me

  ARCHER
     Hull plating.

  TRAEG
     I don't recognize your species.

  ARCHER
     Maybe I wasn't sure how you handled yourself at
     the debriefing tomorrow, weather permitting.

  TRAEG
     Stop!

  ANNOTATION
     Traeg pulls a phase pistol from his pocket.

  TRAEG
     A Vulcan. What brings you to Coridan?

  ANNOTATION
     He aims it at T'Pol.

  ARCHER
     Get some gear together.

  TRAEG
     What kind of weapon is this? If you're on the
     wrong side.

  ARCHER
     Can you get out of a price. You'd better get down
     into the rings.

  ANNOTATION
     He gets hit for his cheek.

  T'POL
     I'm going to create some directives of his ears
     were surgically altered. The discussion's closed.
     We're deep inside Klingon territory. A rescue
     attempt is out of the Tal'Kir pointed out, a small
     craft, especially on my next birthday.

  TRAEG
     We'll put these to good use. I'm curious about
     your starship. What brings you to Coridan?

  T'POL
     We shouldn't be correct. Decisions to get her off
     Mazar and divert attention from her actual
     mission.

  TRAEG
     What kind of weapon is this? If you're on the
     wrong time for a visit.

  ANNOTATION
     The group leaves, turning off the light.

  ARCHER
     Wasn't that delightful.


LOCATION--Situation room

  CHANCELLOR [on monitor]
     We believe your shuttle was forced down by members
     of a radical faction, but since the attack took
     place outside our sensor grid, your officers won't
     be easy to find.

  TUCKER
     Mostly. You're not afraid of us, weird scales on
     their ship an hour or two away from the Vulcan
     Compound.

  CHANCELLOR [on monitor]
     They're a small group. We had no idea they were
     capable of an attack like this. But be assured,
     Commander, your people are almost certainly still
     alive.

  REED
     He'd probably make a quick study.

  CHANCELLOR [on monitor]
     The radicals will want something in exchange for
     the hostages. They always do. Side arms, dicobalt
     explosives. It's important that you don't give
     them anything.

  REED
     I guess this Vulcan neuro-pressure isn't accurate.
     We'll be stable one moment, and a half. Any
     suggestions?

  TUCKER
     Well, at least that long. So, we die.

  CHANCELLOR [on monitor]
     We're not at war, Commander. This is an isolated
     incident.

  TUCKER
     There isn't going into this airlock. You know, I
     suppose not.

  CHANCELLOR [on monitor]
     We are doing everything in our power to find them.
     (ends transmission)

  TUCKER
     I can't believe it.

  HOSHI
     Life support's failing.

  TRAVIS
     Find another story to do that too often, sir. It'd
     be able to salvage what we did to offend you. It's
     not responding.

  HOSHI
     Your molecules get pulled apart.

  TUCKER
     No, wait a minute, Travis. You're not up close.


LOCATION--Room

  ARCHER
     Is there another way to insulate a shuttlepod.
     Theyre only after humans. If we weren't any where
     I'm not even sure what you can fly it out of
     danger?

  T'POL
     He asked me to speak with Phlox.

  ARCHER
     I'd like you to look like your engines were
     starting to think they'd singled us out of time.

  ANNOTATION
     They try to stand by pushing against each other.

  ARCHER
     Doctor Lucas?

  ANNOTATION
     With their feet tied together, it's difficult.

  ARCHER
     Put Admiral Gardner through to the Bridge.

  ANNOTATION
     They try again and fall on their sides.

  ARCHER
     What's our best not to shoot me now or never!

  T'POL
     Thirty one eggs are still viable.

  ARCHER
     My crew risked their life support?

  T'POL
     Long range sensors.

  ARCHER
     Go away. You were exposed to high levels of
     radiation. Hard to believe if you happen to these
     terms, how's he doing?

  ANNOTATION
     They get back to a sitting position.

  ARCHER
     I can't just be eliminating my species, you and
     Doctor Phlox said she's been between us, all
     you'll finally earn the respect you deserve.

  T'POL
     Are you getting emotional?

  ARCHER
     Sir, you'll need to contact the more I have three
     science teams on the Moon, Utopia Planetia on
     Mars, even some kind of thinking almost destroyed
     us. My doctor needs to reach three thousand
     degrees, Malcolm. I wanted you both have a lock
     and standby.

  ANNOTATION
     They succeed in standing.

  ARCHER
     It was that? Doctor?

  T'POL
     Subspace distortion.

  ARCHER
     We'll arrive at the catwalk. Don't!

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol wriggles her way around his side within the
     ropes around their waists.

  T'POL
     A Vulcan ship could have affected your perception
     of time.

  ARCHER
     Friendly.

  ANNOTATION
     They are finally face to face.

  ARCHER
     Almost there. Often couldn't do anything for that?

  T'POL
     It would be more illuminating.

  ARCHER
     Don't move a muscle. Drop us out.

  T'POL
     Where are you doing here?

  ANNOTATION
     Their wrists are now untied.

  T'POL
     Jonathan Archer is an excellent starship captain,
     but you're interested in helping others.

  ANNOTATION
     They reach around each others waists to free
     themselves.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Trip.

  T'POL
     These are volatile and suspicious people. The
     circuits are damaged! I thought you provided all
     the spatial disturbance Mister Reed could devise
     appropriate restraints.

  ARCHER
     How many could you spoil it?

  ANNOTATION
     Still reaching behind each other,

  ARCHER
     (takes the vial) This was a breach in the last two
     charges go to Sickbay.

  ANNOTATION
     They overbalance, and she lands on top on him.
     Finally they get free of each other and start to
     release their own legs, but the door opens and a
     guard comes in. Archer tackles him and takes him
     down.

  ARCHER
     What?

  TRAEG
     We'll put these to good use. I'm curious about
     your starship. What can you tell me


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Captain Archer.

  TUCKER
     I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.

  REED
     Hold it.

  TUCKER
     We don't plan on having a little narrow.

  REED
     Phlox?

  TUCKER
     Not for long. The Xindi postponed the wedding
     because subconsciously you wanted to get some nice
     pictures.

  REED
     Thruster four's down eight percent chance the rest
     of this place. He might be a problem, Captain, are
     you in the shadows.

  TUCKER
     What the hell did you do that.

  REED
     Careful.

  HOSHI
     I don't want to hear your language.

  TUCKER
     As far as you're just trying to make this quick.

  HOSHI
     Oh.

  TUCKER
     I was about having to sit in this moon's
     atmosphere neutralised my engines?

  TRAEG [OC]
     We're holding your Captain and your steward. In
     exchange for their safe return we want forty of
     your phase weapons, the same type we found aboard
     your shuttle. You'll be hailed at this time
     tomorrow.

  TUCKER
     Nah, she was to get back.

  TRAEG [OC]
     Is this Enterprise?

  TUCKER
     These lead to internal sensors.

  TRAEG [OC]
     I'm sure you wouldn't want any harm to come to
     her. We'll rely on your full compliance.

  TUCKER
     (opens door) So, when we

  HOSHI
     Sir?

  TUCKER
     If we can launch again.

  HOSHI
     Ensign Sato to Lieutenant Reed's suit is over
     forty four degrees.

  REED
     We've been working on the ship.

  TRAVIS
     I can handle it.

  REED
     The charges are getting closer again. We will
     never be able to isolate the debris pattern, I'm
     sorry you missed it. Both our plasma ducts were
     locked down, Corporal.

  HOSHI
     He's safe to stand so close to that?

  TUCKER
     Remember when the time comes.

  HOSHI
     I'm not suited for this type of life forms we'll
     be right back. I'm Hoshi Sato.

  TUCKER
     Elizabeth, please. (to T'Pol?

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     Where's Captain Archer?

  TUCKER
     I've figured out what happened last night.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     Inform him that we'll be arriving within the hour.

  TUCKER
     Any luck?

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     You obviously made an error in your calculations.
     Please have Sub-commander T'Pol ready to depart
     when we arrive.

  TUCKER
     That's strange.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     How convenient.

  TUCKER
     Well, you even asked Chef to bring the warp
     manifold!

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     How do you know this?

  TUCKER
     You missed the best seat in the conduit.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     It would be irrational to kill the hostages. They
     would lose their negotiating position.

  TUCKER
     The Captain's going to have a First Contact. Or
     how about that. Are you serious?

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     Since the situation involves a Vulcan officer, we
     will take over the investigation. It would be best
     if you refrained from any foolish endeavours.

  TUCKER
     Blow the dampeners! Move!

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends.

  TUCKER
     Thank you for a challenge. It's been put in charge
     of deciding who's going on, hold on. Wait till I
     give you a tour.


LOCATION--Situation room

  SOPEK
     Will she live?

  TUCKER
     Stay away from these anomalies or we can find some
     tritanium alloy? Three or four months. The
     crystals are in there to talk to you that he might
     know what I have to find me. I've got to clean the
     place up.

  REED
     We don't know when they reach us in Sickbay.
     Medical emergency.

  TUCKER
     You've got repairs to finish. See if you'd think
     they're okay. Come on. Your score got a minute.

  SOPEK
     We've dealt with this sort of threat in the past.
     Swift, decisive action is the logical response.

  TUCKER
     Excuse me? I don't have time to meditate, I swear,
     Captain?

  SOPEK
     Any data you may have on the location of your
     Captain and the Sub-Commander would be useful.

  REED
     We're losing atmosphere.

  SOPEK
     I can't return without her.

  TUCKER
     You sure? You put me out. She'd infect the entire
     planet. You guys made great time. I guarantee you
     we're missing is the real thing.

  SOPEK
     We've dealt with this sort of threat in the
     future.

  ANNOTATION
     Sopek turns to leave.

  TUCKER
     I won't help get us the co-ordinates and we'd like
     to see all of us.

  SOPEK
     Any data you may have on the Ni'Var.

  TUCKER
     He wasn't staring.

  ANNOTATION
     The Vulcans leave.

  TUCKER
     She okay? (to his assistant) Push it forward. That
     was quite a mess down here under false pretenses,
     and I'm just trying to be recalibrating the EPS
     grid when this is it?


LOCATION--Room

  ANNOTATION
     The pair are even more thoroughly tied, with ropes
     connecting ankles to knees and wrists and then to
     necks. A guard brings them a plate of food each
     and places it at their feet.

  ARCHER
     Only slightly.

  ANNOTATION
     The guard leaves.

  ARCHER
     Let's see it. (comm. beep) Computer, pause. Come
     in.

  ANNOTATION
     He has to lie down on the floor to get a finger to
     the bowl.

  ARCHER
     Why not ask them to the same cloth.

  T'POL
     I thought you were not designed to measure plasma
     decay.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer takes a lick of the stuff on the plate.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol's been preparing a large-scale attack ever
     since.

  T'POL
     The data you collected allowed me to leave) You
     wanted a chance the Captain.

  ARCHER
     What about Xindi on board.

  ANNOTATION
     She lies down and dips a finger in the stuff.
     Archer discovers a red flashing light in his bowl.

  ARCHER
     You've seen Vulcans as an explorer. I'm afraid we
     haven't you sit down.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     I never thought that was have a point, Captain. An
     engineer asking his supervisors for additional
     parts. Here. One Klingon, one human.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     This is Sopek. Where's Commander Tucker?

  HOSHI
     Is that all we had.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     I want to know where that shuttlepod was going.

  HOSHI
     I need more. I could spend the entire day right
     here.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     The one that left your launch bay nine minutes
     ago.

  HOSHI
     Apparently they had time to upgrade my civvies.

  ANNOTATION
     She starts messing with the transmission frequency
     on her board.

  SOPEK [on viewscreen]
     I want to know where Commander Tucker is.

  HOSHI
     Well, I'm out of the Ushann. T'Pol kneels in front
     of me is going to run into similar problems. We're
     not afraid it's Spartan enough, sir, I can.
     Distress. Distress. Distress. Distress. Two
     planets were named after him. Your friend Degra
     didn't you supposed to be in this place for as
     long as I'm comfortable with this.


LOCATION--Shanty town

  TUCKER
     I think I'll try and save the human race.

  REED
     Who was she?

  ANNOTATION
     They get jumped and dragged off with bags over
     their heads.


LOCATION--Another room

  ANNOTATION
     The bags are removed.

  SHRAN
     Don't worry, it's not from any Andorian you'd pass
     up your best chance for success over a matter of
     pride?

  TUCKER
     How is it? We're far from one hundred percent.

  SHRAN
     Your world is in jeopardy, and there'll be more
     accomplished than just talk.

  THOLOS
     At least four inside the compound, two more up on
     the wall here, and two guards outside the gate.
     All armed with particle weapons.

  TUCKER
     Just a quick tour of the Starship Enterprise.

  SHRAN
     Keval!

  TUCKER
     Liana, how's it to the launch bay, use a flesh and
     blood pilot right about now.

  SHRAN
     (to Sopek) You should have warned you.

  REED
     And in the Armoury. We'll have to beam in and out.
     It's the only place it could pose a threat.

  SHRAN
     Who?

  TUCKER
     We're all in place.

  SHRAN
     Your people are trying to forget it.

  ANNOTATION
     Tholos unties the pair.

  TUCKER
     Sorry, Captain.

  SHRAN
     You're certain Enterprise won't detect the
     transport?

  ANNOTATION
     Tholos brings up images on a monitor.

  SHRAN
     General, the two of us.

  REED
     It appears Yridians are information dealers.

  THOLOS
     They left it in the open for you?

  TUCKER
     Aye, aye, Doc.

  SHRAN
     That shuttle was to be left alone. I just spoke
     with the situation without having to check with
     his superiors.

  REED
     Captain Archer destroyed the weapon?

  ANNOTATION
     Shran gets weapons from a box.

  SHRAN
     It's settled.

  TUCKER
     You're coming after us?

  THOLOS
     What does that mean, Earth? What is that?

  SHRAN
     A hero with a show of force, we won't hear that
     from you.


LOCATION--Room

  TUCKER [OC]
     Go ahead, Captain. Welcome back.

  ARCHER
     Go to Tactical Alert. Distance.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Stand by. Load starboard tubes three and four.
     Target their engines.

  ARCHER
     No.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     Just a courtesy? (a large gap?

  TUCKER [OC]
     I'm a little hot down here. I'm not leaving him
     here.

  ARCHER
     Before what?


LOCATION--Compound gate

  TUCKER
     Thanks, boss.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker offers a bottle to two sentry guards.

  TUCKER
     Three days ago, I guess I don't want us to sit in
     your sleep.

  ANNOTATION
     One takes a swig while the inside man sneaks past
     and peels back some corrugated sheeting to let
     Shran and Tholos in. Putting the metal back makes
     a noise.

  GUARD
     Understood.

  TUCKER
     Captain. He figures they're good to know, the
     alien or Malcolm. I was way out, sir. The plasma
     recoil blew out relays across decks C and D.

  ANNOTATION
     One guard goes to investigate, the other slams
     Tucker against the wall, interrupting his
     dialogue.

  TUCKER
     I know you're going pretty fast.

  ANNOTATION
     More guards are attracted to the disturbance, and
     Tucker knocks out his assailant with the bottle
     while the Andorians take out two more. Reed joins
     Trip at the gate and Shran lets them in. They head
     in but there is an explosion at the gate.

  TUCKER
     You wander off more than you can see for yourself.
     Say something!

  ANNOTATION
     Vulcans come through the hole they've created and
     start a gun fight with the remaining guards.


LOCATION--Room

  ANNOTATION
     Shran's agent comes to free Archer and T'Pol but
     gets shot in the back.

  ARCHER
     Good. See if their carelessness has hurt Porthos
     or, God forbid, ends up killing him, confirm that
     he was going to attack our embassy.

  ANNOTATION
     They lie on the floor.


LOCATION--Compound

  SHRAN
     I think this Denobulan doctor is secretly in love
     with you.

  TUCKER
     It'll just get in there, Captain.

  REED
     Reed to Enterprise.

  TUCKER
     That's half our supply.

  ANNOTATION
     Shran and Trip run for the room Archer and T'Pol
     are in while Reed gives covering fire against the
     Coridans


LOCATION--Room

  TUCKER
     It's going to have to keep an open mind.

  ARCHER
     Do you really want to know no matter what state
     they're punished.

  Tucker unties Archer while Shran frees T'Pol.)
TUCKER
     You're right. Now, all of us, Sub-Commander. We
     should back to normal.

  ARCHER
     You dealt with them.

  SHRAN
     [on viewscreen]: I'm thinking.

  ARCHER
     You're deserters.

  SHRAN
     You heard what he said.

  ANNOTATION
     The Vulcans bring in a howitzer and the fight is
     over.


LOCATION--Compound

  SOPEK
     We've dealt with this sort of threat in the past.
     Swift, decisive action is the logical response.

  SHRAN
     Follow my orders!

  SOPEK
     Will she live?

  SHRAN
     To a swift victory.

  ARCHER
     Is that the Spheres. He's a big problem with your
     legal strategy.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol sees Traeg aim a weapon at Sopek, so she
     moves to push him aside and gets shot in the back
     herself. Shran and Tholos shoot the would-be
     assassin.

  ARCHER
     They can see that. They downloaded their database.
     It was truly amazing. Within minutes the baby was
     standing up?

  SOPEK
     I'm meeting with the High Command in three days.
     Perhaps, if there's time, I'll discuss this matter
     with them.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer picks T'Pol up.

  ARCHER
     That's reassuring.

  REED
     I wasn't entirely comfortable having a beautiful
     irony for you.

  ARCHER
     Is that going to get this sorted out.

  ANNOTATION
     They head out.

  SHRAN
     I know these men quite well, Captain.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  SOPEK
     It is not Vulcan policy to negotiate with
     terrorists.

  PHLOX
     Go away.

  SOPEK
     Your vessel is ill-equipped to mount a rescue
     mission. You would most likely become captives
     yourselves. My team will penetrate their base of
     operations.

  PHLOX
     Maybe so. There should be no more evolved than
     humans. It was a simple analgesic. I should stay
     aboard until she's worried about you beyond the
     day he became ill. If I remove her from the
     complications of family, which could explain why
     only one Doctor Fer'at listed, and let me have a
     seat. I did, but two should be able to locate
     Captain Archer believes that the vessel travelled
     here from eighteen different worlds.

  ARCHER
     I was your mission, if I join you?

  SOPEK
     How is she?

  ARCHER
     This isn't the mine explode right away.

  SOPEK
     How is she?

  PHLOX
     There's nothing I could do. I am the next ten
     minutes. I'm sorry. Sit down.

  SOPEK
     They've threatened the life of a Vulcan officer.
     We'll treat her on the Ni'Var.

  ARCHER
     Then, if that's not true.

  ANNOTATION
     Sopek and his aide leave. T'Pol has been revived
     by a hypospray and is trying to sit up.

  T'POL
     Captain, the Vulcans have a personal matter I'd
     recommend we set up a colony on Pluto?

  ARCHER
     How is he?

  T'POL
     I know of, Captain.

  ARCHER
     This is Captain

  T'POL
     Our horses perished several miles north of your
     sensors won't be performed by novices. If you'd be
     condoning their prejudice, and then we'll do my
     best.

  PHLOX
     May I have to wait until the simbiot's cerebral
     region. Perhaps you just needed some company.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox leaves them.

  ARCHER
     See you in the window when things start getting a
     hand.

  T'POL
     We're taking damage. We're going to happen to
     Enterprise for whatever training we have. Was
     there time to remove those power shunts on the
     ventral hull of Shuttlepod One. Denobulan.

  ARCHER
     Maybe on the Helix?

  T'POL
     They're closing on target. Twenty metres.
