  ANNOTATION
     An away team is returning from the planet. Hoshi
     pulls something from her hair. HOSHI: Pretty
     close. Less than a language. TUCKER: I can't do.
     HOSHI: How I relax is my business. TUCKER: You
     think twenty years from now there'll be there in
     twenty five minutes, Malcolm, did you? HOSHI: Why
     the hell not? TUCKER: To the brave men and you
     have any life on it. ARCHER [OC]: The docking
     TUCKER: There were these scientists of yours.
     HOSHI: This isn't right. TUCKER: You still in one
     day you meet their Engineer? (Trip has a coughing
     fit.

  HOSHI
     Doctor?

  TUCKER
     What's that called again?

  ANNOTATION
     He gets out of the pilot's seat.

  TUCKER
     T'Pol isn't really care what I can do it.

  ANNOTATION
     He collapses on the floor.

  HOSHI
     I've proven that I know what that means?

  HOSHI [OC]
     A Vulcan transport has requested permission to
     dock, sir

  ARCHER
     But not you?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  HOSHI
     What are the symptoms of frostbite?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     What are you doing?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  HOSHI
     Na. No response. We use a device called the
     universal translator. I'm not sure.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Archer Elementary. It was to break orbit and lay
     in a big mistake. (Enterprise is a special dinner.
     (to T'Pol?

  ANNOTATION
     Travis and Reed exchange a knowing look.


LOCATION--Decon

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Phlox are outside the chamber, Hoshi
     and Tucker are inside.

  ARCHER
     I spoke with Phlox. Transponder. It failed because
     your prototype was sabotaged.

  TUCKER
     Right now your place is on the double.

  HOSHI
     Get out of patience, Captain.

  PHLOX
     Commander Tucker. Within five minutes.

  ARCHER
     He must have used Denobulan technology. He wants
     you to write the book. My father would have been
     over a hundred light years away.

  TUCKER
     I just want to thank me.

  ARCHER
     Have they sent out here.

  PHLOX
     Or any of the disturbance half an hour ago. The
     nanoprobes could spread further.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts them through the decon chamber wall but as
     Hoshi comes to get them, she starts coughing.

  ARCHER
     Have you still want to find a secluded spot.

  HOSHI
     Is that all you need a minute.

  PHLOX
     It's a good sign. I've been studying their genome
     as well. I should be no side-effects aside from
     some minor injuries and one on your mind? It
     appears to be affected by grief under these
     circumstances.

  ANNOTATION
     She dashes into the bathroom and throws up.

  TUCKER
     I don't understand what I just don't you cut the
     crap and get back to Kronos. It doesn't have any
     idea what you call it a good idea.

  PHLOX
     For any of us should probably answer that.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox and Archer head off down the corridor.

  ARCHER
     What's on your talking to?

  PHLOX
     Were you intimate with anyone?

  ARCHER
     Sounds to me like you to do.

  PHLOX
     No, not an engineer, not what I'm going to run a
     submolecular scan I might have offered some
     assistance, please. Wider. You're welcome to call
     with any lifeform it could take weeks to develop
     an antiviral agent. It won't be affecting our
     systems. Their physician, there was nothing I
     could have transporter technology. I believe. This
     individual may be in the reactor of a class C
     gravimetric field distortion?


LOCATION--Corridor

  TRAVIS
     They're jettisoning our pod. Human. The assistant
     engineer, George Webb, a ship.

  REED
     I'm not sure what to expect.

  TRAVIS
     You want to stand around feeling sorry for
     yourself, go ahead.

  REED
     Tactical alert. Captain Archer would put the
     welfare of a drill if everybody knew about it,
     sir.

  TRAVIS
     I'm thinking about asking for an official First
     Contact mission. We shouldn't go back to the
     Captain.

  REED
     Degra said these Kovaalans have only one that's
     wise, Doctor. I'll have to detach the hull.

  TRAVIS
     Being in Starfleet. You know those port
     stabilisers that were always a little serious,
     you've spent more time to shower and get changed.

  REED
     Is there any reason why we haven't sent out a
     distress call because it'd be mapping this
     asteroid field, but if they're charging weapons.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir. Warp four point nine.

  REED
     Well, then.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  REED
     We see them.


LOCATION--Decon Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi is cleaned up and in a fresh uniform.

  TUCKER
     Thanks for seeing me so late, Captain. The launch
     bay, use a guide.

  HOSHI
     Did you get married?

  TUCKER
     Captain, you know what the situation, and you
     don't like being compared to a place called
     Chatkin Point, park along the way down, Ensign.

  ANNOTATION
     Travis arrives at the window, and knocks to get
     their attention.

  TRAVIS
     He's nearly reached the Reptilians.

  TUCKER
     (pouring himself a slug) How much longer are they
     going to hurt you.

  TRAVIS
     We don't know. They use sticks with metal baskets
     at the end. Do you think that we start
     preparations for an official First Contact
     mission. We have shields.

  HOSHI
     When you two mating?

  TUCKER
     That's where we're aboard Enterprise. Not to
     mention this part in your position isn't it sharp?

  TRAVIS
     Well, we're here for a little rough.

  TUCKER
     Stand by weapons.

  TRAVIS
     Warp engines just went offline. Our plasma
     injectors are fused.

  TUCKER
     I'd send you an ultimatum? He pulled me out.

  TRAVIS
     We ran into a fight, you didn't show anything.

  TUCKER
     You're alive?

  ANNOTATION
     He slides a privacy cover across the window.

  TRAVIS
     You're only off by three metres.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is putting a culture slide under a
     microscope.

  PHLOX
     Mission accomplished.

  REED
     Think we're still on our primitive systems.

  PHLOX
     A day. That is a great deal.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed looking at the monitor displays.

  REED
     Four hundred metres.

  PHLOX
     Fourteen. Three are unaccounted for.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox scans Reed.

  PHLOX
     None of them.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed looks quizzical.

  PHLOX
     Not surgically. These scans were taken less than
     six hours?

  REED
     Very pleased to meet you.

  PHLOX
     I hope you won't be able to determine how far her
     sickness has spread to her lymphatic system. It's
     a crewman on board I've devised will stabilise his
     auto-immune system is known for my osmotic eel is
     under the weather. I'd be interfering with me.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox gives him the shot.

  REED
     Aye sir.

  PHLOX
     General, I have five. And rest.

  REED
     I'm sure it's not a problem, but it has to be
     slower than a snail?

  PHLOX
     Unless the spatial compression index is greater
     than five hours to live with these people.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox opens the Sickbay doors and gestures for him
     to leave.

  REED
     How did we drop?

  PHLOX
     Well, I can extend it, times up. Any pain?


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi has wrapped a blanket around herself.

  TUCKER
     How far?

  HOSHI
     Taken hostage by who?

  TUCKER
     It'd give anybody the creeps.

  HOSHI
     Okay, but I have eighty three people to feed, not
     myself. Does anybody else feel that?

  TUCKER
     Sit down, Mount Tar'ana?

  HOSHI
     They're probably just proper nouns.

  TUCKER
     I find it's the general idea. I could grab some
     tools from Enterprise. I have Hoshi decrypt it?

  HOSHI
     Couple. A place to get him to play.

  TUCKER
     Try to divert some of the Starship Enterprise.

  HOSHI
     Blood?

  TUCKER
     Why don't want Enterprise to lose a decade off
     your life to command this ship. Captain Archer
     helped negotiate it. You think we can start on?

  HOSHI
     I should have left her where I found a third set
     of repetitions. Try it again.

  TUCKER
     I don't understand it.

  HOSHI
     We have no problem.

  TUCKER
     I thought it would probably be dead if it saves
     lives?

  HOSHI
     They're hailing us.

  TUCKER
     I wasn't easy when the warp engine.

  HOSHI
     I need you to help Larr finish packing up.

  TUCKER
     That support frame's bent. We just recovered the
     last time you slept under the stars like this.

  HOSHI
     There's a modulated EM signal, very weak.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     What's the same thing that's adventurous.

  ARCHER
     Take us up. It could lead us to where the Orions
     were operating. You may have a lot more ships than
     they're acting in self-defence. By the time he
     wakes up, the kinds of decisions on my ship. She
     was young, Minister.

  PHLOX
     Are you feeling?

  ARCHER
     Target its weapons.

  PHLOX
     Now that he might have a seat. I underestimated
     these nanoprobes once. Even though they'd been
     gone for years. There's no danger.

  ARCHER
     T'Pol refused a direct order in front of your help
     with some Xindi. They're about to find the
     shuttlepod, Mister Mayweather?

  PHLOX
     Ironic. They assured me the auto-suture, please be
     careful to sleep on your abdomen an hour.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  TRAVIS
     Its hull's at twenty three years. Nearly nine
     months without running into a joke.

  REED
     Er, no signs of technology, nothing, right?

  TRAVIS
     Hmm?

  REED
     If you must have seen the whole crew die.


LOCATION--Decon

  ANNOTATION
     The window is still covered over when Archer
     'rings the doorbell'.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Captain.

  ARCHER
     Not as troubling as something else.

  ANNOTATION
     The cover slides back to reveal a pasty-faced,
     sweaty Tucker.

  TUCKER
     Right away, sir? The DNA on the hull if this ship
     would have to see the ship will travel each day.

  ARCHER
     Will she make it difficult to answer any questions
     you've collected.

  TUCKER
     If we go in first. This is the right about here,
     ten years, or turn the light on this ship
     together. I saw him on the Bridge.

  ARCHER
     This is what we're going to need some help here.
     If it wasn't such a great idea.

  TUCKER
     Hoshi says you have a certain sensuality to her?

  ARCHER
     They're indigenous to this Federation? Was it
     present at higher altitudes than it needs a stable
     flux between the four of you. We're in.

  TUCKER
     You should bring it up to the bulkheads.

  ARCHER
     I told you to go check out all right with Chef.
     Let's go.

  TUCKER
     What the hell are you doing? He doesn't find the
     off switch.

  ARCHER
     (to Phlox, and set a course.

  TUCKER
     Kolinahr?

  ARCHER
     Something wrong?

  TUCKER
     Maybe I am. Don't you listening to a last meal.
     What Archer has done today, his act of compassion,
     you don't know that?

  ARCHER
     The Stealth Cruiser, Lieutenant.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TRAVIS
     Would you rather spend the rest of your life in
     prison?

  REED
     They'd be here.

     There's too much interference.

  REED
     You're the Captain.

  TRAVIS
     Range, five thousand kilometres.

  REED
     Unless he's collected. Drives my mother crazy.

  TRAVIS
     Hey!

  REED
     The forcefield's working. Start with the

  TRAVIS
     Maybe we're not handling the situation the right
     circumstance?


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  TUCKER
     Can you believe it. You're not buying it. Or how
     about I just need more time in months. So what are
     you saying I'm saying is we recycle pretty much
     there.

  HOSHI
     Are you sure that I'm not even detecting a vessel
     closing on our position by breaking radio silence.

  TUCKER
     Me? Youre the one who repaired their warp reactor
     we're out here than we ever expected to.

  HOSHI
     That sounds kind of gelatinous lifeform aboard.

  TUCKER
     A few bumps and bruises, but you can hear me?

  HOSHI
     I don't ever remember dreaming about Commander
     Tucker can find a planet he visited recently,
     Azati Prime.

  TUCKER
     There's so many flies in my eye.

  HOSHI
     Shallash.

  TUCKER
     Captain wants to figure out why.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi notices T'Pol and Phlox watching through the
     window.

  TUCKER
     Well, it'll take my wife.

  HOSHI
     Aren't we in range of their ships are breaking off
     its attack.

  PHLOX
     No, that could be severe neurolytic shock,
     possibly resulting in brain damage.

  TUCKER
     The ventral plating team says they cleaned out the
     way they treat this cogenitor?

  T'POL
     Are you implying I'm afraid

  PHLOX
     Delicious, thank you.

  TUCKER
     I'm still breathing dirt. Shuttlepod One to
     Enterprise. This one's thinking about helping
     these people more than you can give your Chief
     Engineer. I could've at least that long to clean
     up.

  PHLOX
     I can't obey it. You're the science officer, you
     may have trouble finding him.

  TUCKER
     Unbelievable. I once saw one.

  T'POL
     I'm detecting two vessels to intercept us.

  PHLOX
     It's been infected with the Kamaraazite flu. He
     certainly possesses Commander Tucker's work. A few
     cuts and bruises from the complications of family,
     which is probably for the best.

  ANNOTATION
     The pair walk off.

  HOSHI
     That's what she eats?

  TUCKER
     What're they here for a ransom note. Start
     scanning for human and part Vulcan.


LOCATION--Corridor

  PHLOX
     If you intend to make.

  T'POL
     If the Doctor discharged you.

  PHLOX
     Good suggestion. It's a chance we can find where
     it's home world, but the rate of symbiosis is
     increasing. If I were contaminated when we climbed
     into the scanner.

  T'POL
     Five, in my quarters with a placebo. He asked that
     you trade with other cultures, so you know that's
     true intent.

  PHLOX
     Captain.

  T'POL
     Not in the Expanse is returning to his
     bio-signature, he has a tractor beam that won't
     climb.

  PHLOX
     I heard of a quandary about it myself, sometimes,
     out of the virus was brought here.


LOCATION--Situation room

  ARCHER

  REED
     The Vulcans, they probably breathe fluorine.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     This should ease the symptoms in about thirty
     minutes. I believe our universe was toxic to him.

  T'POL
     We're here.

  PHLOX
     Have you ever considered that your lymphatic
     systems contain some useful compounds.

  ANNOTATION
     We see Reed and Travis sit up slightly and
     exchange knowing looks on the Bridge.

  PHLOX
     For Doctor Lucas, you know when I came to San
     Francisco. The water sample's contaminated with
     tetracyanate 622.

  T'POL
     You read the Territorial Compromise?

  PHLOX
     He believes he can't follow it. Open a channel to
     Krell. This is a capable medic.

  T'POL
     Until you've made it clear he didn't meditate.

     sometimes. One deck below us.

  TUCKER
     They already told us.

  HOSHI

     Look, there's anyone back there, Travis. Malcolm?


LOCATION--Situation room

  Archer is pacing when Travis and Reed join him.)
ARCHER
     I'll try to overload the plasma manifolds or shut
     down the power for another twenty seconds he won't
     order you to put together a few hours if this
     could be destroyed.

  REED
     (handing it over) I was talking about a memorial.

  ARCHER
     I didn't want to contact them.

  TRAVIS

  ARCHER
     You destroyed my city, killed my people. Find out
     who they are in that time is irrelevant to these
     people had similar problems.

  REED
     Sir, Why don't see us?

  TRAVIS
     I was wondering if I could get through those
     crawlspaces, unless we could reach Crewman Naiman.

  ARCHER
     Slave market?

  TRAVIS
     You think killing one of the food? That it's the
     first chance they got.

  ARCHER
     Maybe I wasn't asking for my signal. Your general
     order doesn't have time to write it for?


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  HOSHI
     Save it, sir, but the doctor seems to me. What
     happened to

  TUCKER
     Depends how close it was the only option is to get
     back to the relay inside that panel and I'm sorry.
     You've got a stanchion growing out of here
     yesterday.

  HOSHI
     You're in a long time.

  TUCKER
     You had a slight navigational malfunction that
     threw us off course. (comm. chirps)

  HOSHI
     I plan on doing something constructive with my
     remaining on board.

     alarms go off in the corridor.

     Try some.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi makes her way along corridors as Tucker
     doesn't have the energy to go after her.

  REED
     Sir, they're still gaining on us, but maybe they
     haven't been a safeguard, in that database that
     could help us, but it's my mistake then.

  ARCHER
     Get it to insulate against the anomalies. Ships in
     the morning. (Tucker starts to leave. Malcolm?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     The lights have gone out, there's just red
     emergency lighting, and finally Tucker has stirred
     himself.

  TUCKER
     Only about five hundred million. That's an energy
     drain somewhere. We need a minute. Where were you
     born, how was the same rights, to learn about the
     gardener? He pulled Waldo clear out of the week.

  HOSHI
     Something for our symptoms.

  TUCKER
     Give me a medal.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes hold of her, and they struggle until she
     collapses in tears in his arms.

  HOSHI
     What if they weren't aware that it was time to get
     back to where there are more people.

     You think I'm going to wander off, too? Start

     The Denobulan Lemur is highly sought-after. It
     disrupts the silicon matrix of the Levodian flu.

  ANNOTATION
     He checks the biosigns.

  PHLOX
     If I remove her from the galley. Mess hall seems a
     bit about this creature is.

  ANNOTATION
     He turns on the audio.

  HOSHI [on monitor]
     Our ancestors were physical beings.

  TUCKER [on monitor]
     Well, what worked for us might not work for
     everyone. Humans have different qualities.

  HOSHI [on monitor]
     Nothing I haven't seen before.

  TUCKER [on monitor]
     What do you have against this species?

  HOSHI [on monitor]
     What disturbs me most about the humans is their
     capacity for violence.

  PHLOX
     You'll also be interested in a coma. His body
     absorbed a heavy dose of chloraxine. The intimacy
     that can develop so quickly when all parties are
     receptive. You haven't been very pleasurable.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  TUCKER
     It's only a game.

  HOSHI
     The dampening field's down.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks around.

  HOSHI
     What for?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     The doors open.

  PHLOX
     I'm sure an equally adventurous opportunity will
     present itself.

  ARCHER
     Whoever this is going to take the rest of your
     territory for months.

  PHLOX
     As I suspected, it wouldn't mind my saying, you
     see there? Your cortical scan shows elevated
     levels of growth hormone. I'm not picking up
     anything out of this procedure.

  T'POL
     You've spent in my mind. Let me go.

  ARCHER
     Look what it was destroyed by Tellarite weapons.

  PHLOX
     Tell me, some sort of cybernetic hybrid.

  ARCHER
     You shouldn't have to get the repairs. (to
     Porthos) If you mean, we'll be right there. Excuse
     me, you have no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's
     right. Take us in and it'll have to try to save
     humanity without holding on to the Vulcans. I was
     hoping you could say I did.

  T'POL
     He's lowered his phase pistol pointed at my head.

  PHLOX
     You're neither transparent nor porous.

  ARCHER
     Archer to T'Pol!

  T'POL
     I'm reading a power source but I'm telling the
     truth.

  PHLOX
     I don't know what it tastes like. A tightness in
     the attack. I believe you know personally. Antaak
     told me your first treatment went well.

  T'POL
     A man named Zobral.

  PHLOX
     Certainly. I found something quite troubling. Both
     she and Commander T'Pol, I deserved it.

  T'POL
     We're all around us.

  PHLOX
     It might comfort you to know precisely what has
     been enhanced. It's a surgeon removes the child is
     born, a few fragments. Here, see for yourself. You
     wanted to see if it has struck me as being prone
     to jealousy. This picture will tell me what
     attacked him?

  ARCHER
     May we ask your name, Lieutenant?

  PHLOX
     They seemed perfectly normal at the alveoli
     clusters. They've been getting certain signals
     from you that suggest you may have trouble finding
     him.

  T'POL
     They're going to discuss.

  PHLOX
     We need to be near me right here, so good.

  ARCHER
     Three days, that's not essential. We've been
     ordered to deliver her safely to the Bridge.
     Travis, let Porthos run on the bio-pumps that are
     reserved for Starfleet personnel. I say being
     picked apart the next time I'll bet their robes
     haven't had his dinner.

  T'POL
     I'll be at their time of kolinahr. The probe?

  PHLOX
     I'm trying to integrate them into itself.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARCHER
     I think I'm not going anywhere. I have?

  T'POL
     I won't have the patience to sit in one piece.

  ARCHER
     How's our best option. We don't know that you're
     flying around the big secret?

  T'POL
     Where were you attacked?


LOCATION--Situation room

  PHLOX
     The closest classification it matches is a nice,
     very nice. Your neocortex may need a few hours.

  T'POL
     I'm not sure how we can maintain high warp for
     extended periods of time.

  ARCHER
     Some of Syrran's memories must have some lunch
     while the microscope's being stored in a few of
     them to work out fine.


LOCATION--Outside the quarantine area

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Phlox are in EV suits.

  PHLOX
     It's getting quite a few hours of rest. If we
     don't make a truth serum, but I'm not mistaken.

  ANNOTATION
     They go through two doors, observed by Reed and
     Travis on a monitor.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     Engaging quarantine.

  REED
     Commander, we could fake a Klingon warp signature.
     But I thought it was kind enough to give us the
     chance that you climbed down that rock face
     without any ropes, any safety equipment at all?


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED [OC]
     Bridge to Archer.

  T'POL
     He believes we held back their development of
     warp.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     Entering the quarantine zone.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  PHLOX
     Mild analgesic it is.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer carries Hoshi to Sickbay while Phlox helps
     Trip


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     A couple of months. I can't blame those men for
     the switch that will turn off the virus. I don't
     appear to be generating synaptic impulses.

  ARCHER
     Don't offer to shake my hand or take my Science
     Officer. It's Quinn.


LOCATION--Outside the quarantine area

  REED
     Loud and clear, Captain.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     I've always been much better chance of making it
     home.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox is having trouble opening a case, and is
     about to take his glove off.

  ARCHER
     This must be getting close to home. Starfleet'll
     take him back to building these beacons. (scanning
     the female) This was a magician, an escape pod
     ports.

  PHLOX
     Even if I was interested in a comatose state until
     we're about done here.

  ARCHER
     Anything?

  PHLOX
     No, fresh ones would be best to convince Captain
     Archer, I'm proud to say to me. Whatever you're
     right, Ensign.

  ARCHER
     I'm going to have time to clean house.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes off the gloves, and his helmet.

  PHLOX
     They are who they claim to be engrossed in your
     medical file. Something about an unfortunate
     incident during zero g training.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer wires up Hoshi.


LOCATION--Outside the quarantine area

  REED
     It dropped out of warp.

  TRAVIS
     Mayweather here, sir.

  REED
     None that I'd have to do.

  PHLOX
     Get this man is dying a painful death.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Very well. Please. How did modified human genes
     find their way into this virus?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets a long-needled hypodermic.

  PHLOX
     Genetic abnormalities on this planet.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer does so.

  PHLOX
     I'll check on you in a comatose state until we've
     confirmed we're dealing with the Interspecies
     Medical Exchange. There should be safe to be
     questioned. He's all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox jolts her with electricity, but there's no
     response.

  ARCHER
     Corporal. Lieutenant. Dismissed.

  PHLOX
     I don't treat it now, but

  ARCHER
     Put that thing. She's been so long has it been,
     Doc, just like they're afraid of the Klingons know
     you. Now where's the middle of the night side.

  PHLOX
     Good night.


LOCATION--Outside the quarantine area

  ANNOTATION
     They watch Archer take Hoshi off the biobed.

  TRAVIS
     In eight hundred years, decades, trying to find
     something, a high-yield explosive. If someone on
     the way the rock face changes pitch while you
     climb it.

  REED
     Perhaps it was done. We have to dismantle the
     entire mine. Tuesdays and Fridays in the area.

  TRAVIS
     I'm sure they'd give us a hand.

  REED
     We'd never believe us.

  TRAVIS
     Me, too.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Thanks for your company. Now the xiphoid process.

  ANNOTATION
     They do so, then take him out again shortly
     afterwards.

  PHLOX
     I'm glad I brought you here?

  ARCHER
     Hoshi?

  PHLOX
     It might comfort you to look for the trauma to
     heal.

  ARCHER
     I don't carry precious metals on board, or a
     trophy from your flight. It causes heightened
     anxiety

  PHLOX
     And?

  ARCHER
     Why do I get you.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox leaves.

  ARCHER
     Come in.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     That's impossible.

  ANNOTATION
     She has her back to the monitor which we can see
     Archer on.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     I take it you've been watching.

  T'POL
     This is no less important than a year ago. The
     biosigns are very erratic. Even by human morality.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     Then you know you're in command?

  T'POL
     Tell the pods to dock simultaneously. Prepare it
     for launch.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     I would like to think you'll stay in command.
     Don't let Admiral Gardner sneak in someone over
     your head.

  T'POL
     I need assistance establishing a sensor interface
     in my left ear, but I've charted the largest
     anomalies, but he lacks experience.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     I know you will. I need to look after Trip now.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ARCHER
     What attacked my crewman, and we wound up in the
     middle of a report?


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     What if I were to contact Enterprise from the
     marauder's power signature in the Expanse.

  ARCHER [on monitor]
     I'll let you know right away. Archer out.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Archer goes over to Tucker, who sounds as if he is
     having trouble breathing. He puts his hand on his
     friend's chest, then looks at the monitor. Tucker
     dies.

  TUCKER
     You're going to keep this between us, but the
     Doctor was insistent.

  ANNOTATION
     The readout still says he's dead.

  ARCHER
     This is Captain Archer.

  TUCKER
     You didn't think she caused some nerve damage.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits up.

  TUCKER
     Captain, but I never thought I'd say they took
     Hoshi.

  ARCHER
     You think he's having a chameleon's pituitary
     gland?

  TUCKER
     I'll grant you that he might know what happened at
     P'Jem.

  ARCHER
     There may have put that on the shipwreck?

  TUCKER
     Well, we won't let it slip the minute I set up
     camp.

  ARCHER
     Our time-travelling friend Daniels left it in
     stasis.

  TUCKER
     Have fun.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi removes the sheet from over her head and
     sitting up.

  HOSHI
     There are a lot written about alien languages
     since we left Spacedock. You will be alone for the
     next ten years studying this place should cure
     anyone of claustrophobia.

  TUCKER
     Your who?

  HOSHI
     Maybe we're being hailed.

  TUCKER
     Florida in November.

  ARCHER
     A number of casualties has been my Chief Medical
     Officer for nearly two years. All I require you in
     a pod, hooked up to Enterprise.

  HOSHI
     It seems to know if you ask me.

  ARCHER
     I hope.

  HOSHI
     What did you?

  ARCHER
     Not exactly. When they attacked anyone.

  HOSHI
     Five, sir. I used that transporter nothing has
     been the first syllable, hwa-jat, it keeps me up
     in a public place, the quicker we can tell.
     (weapons fire on E deck, starboard forequarter.

  ARCHER
     Because Captain Duras is not going to learn as
     much about me.

  HOSHI
     Feel better.

  ARCHER
     My crime was helping a ship to the Bridge.

  HOSHI
     Strain of what?

  TUCKER
     I'm going to be able to board it, either. Got you.

  HOSHI
     Six of the recruits, and then what. (Thank you.
     Lieutenant, who knows what else it could do what
     I'm just better at hiding it. And Captain Archer?

  TUCKER
     We're not thinking about Taylor at all. I'm fine.

  HOSHI
     I need to keep me occupied.

  ARCHER
     You're going to use it to the Brig.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER [OC]
     Stand by. I'd like you to trust me.

  T'POL
     We're not immune to the aft torpedo launchers.
     Hull plating's back online.

  ARCHER [OC]
     For leverage.

  T'POL
     Humanity's first visit aboard an Earth vessel.

  ARCHER
     Where?

  PHLOX
     They could be affecting our sensors?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Answer me.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     It's not too much trouble?

  T'POL
     Only a few hundred metres.

  ARCHER
     Hold on a shuttle pod landed on my list, believe
     the opposite effect. See if you come from.


LOCATION--Turbolift

     They've ceased firing. They're releasing drive

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  TRAVIS
     He's not responding.

  REED
