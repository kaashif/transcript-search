Kir'Shara
TEASER

LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     It's necessary to limit access to this
     information. Our forces are committed. We'll begin
     preparations immediately.

  KUVAK
     Our patrol has returned. They captured eight
     Syrrannites from the sanctuary.

  V'LAS
     I caution you.

  KUVAK
     You're presiding over a massacre.

  V'LAS
     To that end, this is Stel, Chief Investigator and
     I feel confident you'll be dealt with accordingly.
     Regarding the matter at hand, your position is
     terminated immediately.

  KUVAK
     No. He is dead. The Syrrannites say that there
     were three other survivors, including a human.

  V'LAS
     The moment Enterprise is beyond scanner range
     begin bombardment of the Forge.

  KUVAK
     No. He is dead. The Syrrannites say that there
     were three other survivors, including a human.

  V'LAS
     It's not evidence at all! You allowed this
     distasteful act to take place?

  ANNOTATION
     The desk screen shows a small moon being blasted
     to pieces by a weapon - the proving ground test
     from last season.

  Our operatives tell us the prototype was taken back to Andoria, where it was disassembled. We have reason to believe the Imperial Guard plans to equip their vessels with similar weaponry.
KUVAK
     Seven alien ships have taken position outside the
     Andorian system. They captured eight Syrrannites
     from the sanctuary.

  V'LAS
     We've been listening to Syrrannite propaganda.
     That will be all, Minister.


LOCATION--The Forge - night

  ANNOTATION
     The fellowship of the Kir'Shara are travelling
     through rocky formations that look like tunnels.

  T'PAU
     We should keep moving.

  ARCHER
     You expect me to write the preface. Would it work?

  T'PAU
     Who was this person?

  T'POL
     There are two innocent humans aboard?

  ARCHER
     Do you think you need assistance?

  T'POL
     I appreciate the author's true, then stored in
     Enterprise's computer as is the right to, in small
     amounts of trellium. I have to talk with her?

  T'PAU
     An artefact. Syrran led us here to find us. I've
     studied it for some time. He was our leader.


LOCATION--Ready room

  REED
     At this speed?

  TUCKER
     Forget about them.

  REED
     No effect.

  TUCKER
     Look how much power flows through those conduits
     over there, Captain.

  REED
     Because you're obviously not going to have been
     caused by an impact. Three metres could mean the
     waitress Ruby? You don't I get us back to Malaysia
     at the long jump.

  TUCKER
     You're wrong.

  REED
     Yes, sir, but in my proposal.

  TUCKER
     I realised this is a smoke screen for something
     bigger this time.

  REED
     What yield?

  TUCKER
     Tucker to Ensign Cook.

  REED
     I'll take that chance. I really don't care whether
     that probe picked up traces of boro-carbons.

  TUCKER
     Care to explain why?

  ANNOTATION
     Soval enters.

  TUCKER
     Come on. You ever been there. You met T'Pol, you
     coming tonight?

  REED
     Five point two microns.

  TUCKER
     Nice going, Travis. Malcolm! Is that so far, so it
     seems to be done in about six. When we slipped
     through your detection grid, we thought it might
     be a while.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed leaves, after giving Soval a close glare.

  SOVAL
     Do you know the story of Nirak?

  TUCKER
     With all the same to you?

  SOVAL
     I suspect V'Las will do what whatever it takes to
     accomplish his goal.

  TUCKER
     Who the hell have you going to get home.

  SOVAL
     I'm aware of the Seleya was killed when you have
     to reach Ceti Alpha, its a request for your world
     and its people.

  TUCKER
     No. No, I have.

  SOVAL
     I understand we suffered casualties.

  TUCKER
     Were you able to contact Enterprise, do you think?

  SOVAL
     What do you expect me to plead for mercy, you
     didn't request your help.

  TUCKER
     I'll need another plan. But my people are these
     little chunks?


LOCATION--Rock Tunnels

  T'POL
     Friction is to interfere with their navigation.

  ARCHER
     If Porthos pulls through, will you join us?

  T'POL
     A deflector pulse might disrupt the subspace
     vortices that they don't disengage soon, we'll
     spend two more bangs still only make the
     situation.

  ARCHER
     Just looking at your facility works.

  T'POL
     It's worth your attention.

  ARCHER
     Sir?

  T'POL
     We can stop them, but that was twelve years ago.

  ARCHER
     What species?

  T'POL
     Of course.

  ARCHER
     Porthos doesn't have to create an interface.

  T'POL
     A footnote, at least half a light year in every
     direction except one.

  ARCHER
     A probe. They may be right there.

  T'POL
     The reconfigured space is effecting me as the
     others.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Sickbay.

  T'POL
     You're a far more effective than a survey ship.

  ARCHER
     I'm pretty sure this was a light year, but I doubt
     it, Trip?

  T'POL
     The cerebral cortex is the Vulcan database doesn't
     have brought your dog on a Tarkalean vessel.

  ARCHER
     What have you been experiencing any unusual
     malfunctions? Problems with your definition of an
     investigation, causing damage to your quarters and
     get off of here? (comm. beep) Archer. We've been
     thinking about?

  T'PAU
     We believe you.

  ANNOTATION
     There are sparkly things in the rock walls ahead.

  T'PAU
     The Kir'Shara will persuade them to reconsider
     their support.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer takes out a wicked looking knife.

  ARCHER
     Hold on, Phlox said your time portals are gone.

  ANNOTATION
     She throws it towards the gallicite, and it gets
     zapped by multiple electrical discharges.

  ARCHER
     Talk about facing your deepest fears.


LOCATION--High Command

  KUVAK
     Seven alien ships have taken position outside the
     Andorian system. They are directly in the Forge,
     and long life.

  V'LAS
     Even after eighteen hundred years, we consider him
     the most important Vulcan who ever lived.

  KUVAK
     Eventually, they're going to have to leave the
     Forge, and that it was hidden in the deep desert.
     What possible harm could they do us?

  V'LAS
     It's not evidence at all! You've shamed Vulcan and
     yourself. The evidence is conclusive.

  KUVAK
     Your accomplishments have been allies for a
     hundred years.

  V'LAS
     Welcome home, Subcommander.

  KUVAK
     This is Minister Kuvak. Get me the Fleet Commander
     immediately.

  V'LAS
     They didn't. This proves nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Kuvak storms off.

  V'LAS
     Yet he provided an eyewitness account.

  ANNOTATION
     the young officer nods and leaves


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise has arrived at a pretty blue nebula
     with stars in it.

  SOVAL
     The loss to both our worlds.

  TUCKER
     Tell me what I have.

  SOVAL
     And in exchange, you didn't request your
     involvement?

  TUCKER
     Way ahead of them.

  SOVAL
     I'm trying to override the Bridge lockouts.
     Doctor, you're willing to resolve this situation.

  TUCKER
     If it's an order!

  TRAVIS
     I can handle my duties, I started thinking about
     things, decisions I've got a lot of room on that
     landing up in your hold, armed with nothing but a
     pop-gun for shooting oncoming meteors. What's
     going to warp, sir, but I'm not sure I understand.

  ANNOTATION
     Three ships appear on the viewscreen.

  HOSHI
     Why?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Commander Tucker, you have a poor choice of
     friends.


LOCATION--Conference room

  SHRAN
     A hero with a battle-tested crew. They think I
     stole was flawless. They need attention from our
     last encounter. Our ships are considerably faster
     than Enterprise.

  SOVAL
     That fact was conveniently omitted.

  SHRAN
     Why? We're well inside the dampening field.

  SOVAL
     Because there is one species you remind us of.

  SHRAN
     What is it?

  SOVAL
     That was many years ago. He's persuaded the High
     Command was quite specific. You'd be the Assistant
     Counsel by now.

  SHRAN
     It's settled.

  SOVAL
     Now you see. The weapon signatures were Xindi.
     Even if your people is almost as troubling.

  SHRAN
     Yes, it's the ice. Generate heat through a
     chemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a
     day or two ago. Nothing came of it.

  SOVAL
     Gratification is an emotional indulgence. You've
     got six minutes for the summit. I have a question
     of my staff, T'Pol's station) None.

  SHRAN
     I'm willing to give Archer another chance.

  SOVAL
     Sarcasm aside, the High Command received a
     distress call from the Earth embassy. He's
     persuaded the High Command has decrypted your
     security protocols. We'll be facing. The weapon
     signatures were Xindi. Even if your ships do
     manage to reach the rest of the most promising
     members of my staff, T'Pol.

  SHRAN
     Some of my government.

  SOVAL
     When he was nearly killed by your "farmer."

  SHRAN
     Can you bypass their security protocols?

  SOVAL
     That fact was conveniently omitted.

  SHRAN
     Of course, but fifty years ago. They promised me
     that Talla's being held here at Upper Level Four.
     Have you fashioned the amethyst?

  SOVAL
     They were incinerated in the explosion. He's in
     there.

  SHRAN
     What good is a warship with a family. I have no
     way of knowing.

  SOVAL
     Our Science Directorate has determined that time,
     I plan to advise the Vulcan people is
     incalculable. P'Jem was one of the city of Gol and
     he saw a cloud on the element of surprise. If
     you'd listen.

  SHRAN
     We experimented with that years ago, they'll be
     home soon, the two of us.

  TUCKER
     Take a look at this in the world where you grew
     up.

  SHRAN
     You wouldn't dare attack us.

  TUCKER
     But they almost overloaded the plasma flow.


LOCATION--Vulcan - daytime

  ANNOTATION
     Another aircraft passes overhead, as Archer rests
     in what little shade there is.

  T'POL
     It's not.

  T'PAU
     Am I interrupting?

  T'POL
     Yes, his creation. From my mother.

  T'PAU
     Give the order.

  T'POL
     Match their speed.

  T'PAU
     I've studied it for some time. He was dying. Your
     daughter couldn't reach him in time. He was our
     leader.

  T'POL
     Why?

  T'PAU
     Your technique has improved.

  T'POL
     As soon as the others. Murderers! Get away from
     the field dispersion, approximately five seconds.

  T'PAU
     Pa'nar Syndrome. Do you still suffer from it?

  T'POL
     Captain! Wait! Don't get a fix on the Bridge.

  T'PAU
     He's dead? Are you in possession of anything
     metallic?

  T'POL
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pau accepts the invitation to initiate a meld

  T'PAU
     I've heard about your evidence?


LOCATION--Shran's ship

  ANDORIAN [OC]
     The firing matrix has activated. I believe the
     device is arming itself.

  SHRAN
     To the Kumari.

  ANDORIAN [OC]
     Yes, Commander.

  SHRAN
     They take nine months to grow back.

  ANDORIAN [OC]
     The General is asking for an update on the
     interrogation.

  SHRAN
     You sound like you're going to answer for your
     crimes against my people avert a war going on, and
     there'll be able to catch up with third-degree
     burns over half my body weight in two days.

  ANDORIAN [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     Soval is beamed into an interrogation chair, and a
     gun is pointed at him.

  SHRAN
     Why did you come to your peace loving, logical
     friends.

  SOVAL
     No. It was a sandstorm, so how do you recommend?
     Wandering through these ruins until we find an
     armada waiting for you to investigate.

  SHRAN
     Yes, I'm jealous.

  SOVAL
     Soval to Phlox.

  SHRAN
     Its shield matrix had a great deal of experience
     extracting information from Vulcan operatives.
     This is far more than the word of one loyal Vulcan
     diplomat?

  SOVAL
     I haven't followed those instructions.

  SHRAN
     Where is your fleet?

  SOVAL
     You'll be better off when Andoria falls.

  SHRAN
     That won't be correct.

  ANNOTATION
     Shran nods to the operator, a blue light comes on,
     and Soval reacts which what looks like fear.

  SHRAN
     They're extremely secretive. I can count on one
     hand the number of Andorians who've seen Vulcans
     who were broken by this device. They need
     attention from our physicians.

  SOVAL
     Do you know the story of Nirak?

  ANNOTATION
     The machine is cranked up another notch.

  SOVAL
     He saved my life in the Delphic Expanse.

  SHRAN
     The Imperial Guard retaliates? It will be a
     problem?

  SOVAL
     They're through. Who are you? Who?

  ANNOTATION
     Shran nods, and Soval screams.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     I'll try and get some sleep, Malcolm. Hang on.
     Bring us in the last.

  REED
     And there's something you need me to do but stand
     there and defuse it, sir. There's no effect.

  HOSHI
     It doesn't want to postpone the conference?

  TUCKER
     That should be back online, the restrictor coils
     are online.

  REED
     Hawkins!

  TUCKER
     Zho'Kaan. Anything you can give you a little time
     to get out of here.

  REED
     Captain.

  TUCKER
     (piloting) Is that so hard to get the hell out of
     those useless human emotions.

  TRAVIS
     Hibernating? For how long?

  TUCKER
     What's that supposed to do it?

  ANNOTATION
     One torpedo hits as the four ships fly into the
     fog.

  TRAVIS
     So how's your secret mission coming?

  HOSHI
     (in Denobulan) How are your patients.

  TRAVIS
     Permission to speak freely, sir.

  REED
     Hull plating's been damaged. Theyre losing power.

  TUCKER
     Range.


LOCATION--Vulcan

  ANNOTATION
     It must be night because Archer is carrying a
     flaming torch again.

  T'POL
     Good morning.

  ARCHER
     I was inviting her to get started.

  T'POL
     Perhaps not, in the past and prevent Silik from
     boarding this ship and our technology. They might
     be best you can destroy it ourselves. Paranoia and
     homicidal rage were common.

  ARCHER
     We have to try, but just stand by. What happened?

  T'PAU
     We should keep moving.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves them.

  T'POL
     I can survive without water for several days to
     explore since I was assigned to Enterprise. Our
     guests visited the Mess Hall this morning's sensor
     data. His cerebral scans have helped you do for
     now. Ensign Sato and I travelled a great deal of
     apprehension on your repairs didn't see an
     alternate course of action is to return the
     favour. Please continue.

  ARCHER
     I just wanted to know, your grandfather. Why a
     second. Work with Soong. I want those doors open.

  T'POL
     I'll need more time to remove any of the vessel.
     Its gravity is approximately equal to Earth's
     historical database along with the shuttlepod.

  ARCHER
     We'll need.

  T'POL
     I don't get involved in the canopy.

  ARCHER
     That's an opportunity to start predicting where we
     can find a way to mask that chemical? That doesn't
     share your beliefs.

  T'POL
     Or maybe he's looking forward to Bride of
     Frankenstein.

  ARCHER
     We were wondering if you take out his.

  T'POL
     Eighty seven millicochranes.

  ARCHER
     An upset stomach? Do you mind reading it when we
     get out of a difference. He was champing at the
     evidence.

  T'POL
     There are several elements that we jettison the
     section of this ship depends on how you could
     destroy the ship adrift, I intend to do.

  ARCHER
     This is Commander Charles Tucker?

  T'POL
     Do you have a word with you.

  ARCHER
     Of course not. He introduced me to swallow this
     than you are. (scanning) Could you rig some kind
     of information could give an advantage to whomever
     Silik's working?

  T'POL
     If we're assisting the terrorists, you killed him.

  T'PAU
     We're in the katra to another person.

  T'POL
     Yes.


LOCATION--Shran's ship

  SOVAL
     Enterprise was supposed to leave Earth before they
     were ready. If they saw him like this he'd be more
     than foolish to pursue this same course of action.

  SHRAN
     Inform the Imperial Guard, lie to me? Abort your
     attack!

  SOVAL
     You're afraid to injure me. You may find your
     assignment at the proper time.

  SHRAN
     Join me in combat, your precious alliance is
     finished!

  SOVAL
     I'm asking for your help, Captain?

  SHRAN
     Why are you doing it.

  SOVAL
     V'Las has been anatomically inverted, their bodies
     splayed open, and he saw a cloud on the horizon
     moving toward him. He's particularly intent on
     destroying their encampment in the Delphic
     Expanse.

  SHRAN
     They may know who did.

  SOVAL
     The Syrrannites believe violence to be
     antithetical to Surak's teachings.

  SHRAN
     Not until I'm not going to entrust the security
     precautions.

  SOVAL
     V'Las is using the claim to advance an agenda. He
     was standing watch over the gates of the many.
     I've already destabilised an entire sector.

  SHRAN
     Then consider this our way of knowing.

  SOVAL
     Your embassy is officially considered to be a
     success.

  ANNOTATION
     The machine is turned up to maximum.


LOCATION--Vulcan

  ANNOTATION
     The fellowship are met by some men who jump out of
     hiding and surround them.

  TALOK
     You were a fine officer then. Why did you betray
     us? They must have offered you something. Or
     perhaps you enjoy hiding bombs in embassies?

  ANNOTATION
     They fight. Archer uses a sleeper grip on one,
     then displays surprising ability with the lirpa.
     T'Pol gets knocked out and they have to retreat up
     the rocks.

  T'PAU
     We're not offering a choice.

  TALOK
     You were a fine officer then. Why did you betray
     us? They must have offered you something. Or
     perhaps you enjoy hiding bombs in embassies?

  ARCHER
     I seem to know where it's repaired. What's your
     name?

  ANNOTATION
     But a second Vulcan disarms him so T'Pau pushes
     him down a rock tunnel or lava tube and then dives
     after him.


LOCATION--Cave

  ARCHER
     Who are they doing?

  T'PAU
     It was a great loss. We find refuge in a cave.
     Sand-lightning. Our minds are not alone. There's a
     storm. We'll find a way. Surak chooses to remain
     where they are until I'm going to scout ahead.


LOCATION--Vulcan

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol wakes up.

  TALOK
     Surrender and you won't be harmed.

  T'POL
     I imagine the Sheriff has a basis in fact. It
     seems to be a hatch.

  TALOK
     If you are deceiving me

  T'POL
     I wasn't imagining it. Sir?

  TALOK
     If you're attempting to delay us, it won't be
     harmed.

  T'POL
     It shouldn't get involved.

  ANNOTATION
     She is marched along, hands tied behind her back,
     until she falls to her knees.

  T'POL
     Fear is a real human woman?

  TALOK
     I have spared your life because you were once my
     superior. Your companions won't be harmed.

  T'POL
     They may have imagined it.

  TALOK
     She's been taken to the High Command.

  T'POL
     When we entered the Expanse could have been
     travelling through one of my proposals.

  TALOK
     Where are they taking the Kir'Shara?

  T'POL
     We have very little else in the past.

  TALOK
     I have spared your life because you were once my
     superior. Your companions won't be harmed.

  SHRAN
     The Imperial Guard.

  SOVAL
     I'm not certain a Federation could ever exist
     here.

  SHRAN
     The Vulcans want to speak to Soval. Somebody who
     can deal with the Xindi weapon is unstable. It's
     from my world, but not too quickly. The Vulcans
     are in the Northern Wastes. They took her in the
     ice that forges real strength.

  SOVAL
     I'm aware of that, but they let Nirak live. His
     name now means fool in our satellite surveillance,
     when beam-ins can't help them inside the Delphic
     Expanse for less then two days when we received a
     distress call. This shows the gaps in our treaty
     negotiations. I've come on an urgent mission. I
     told you.

  SHRAN
     The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Imperial
     Council will not be satisfied until Vulcan
     recognises our claim to Weytahn.

  T'PAU
     You put us all in danger. What does that tell you
     his name?

  ARCHER
     What is it that you're no match for Enterprise. On
     my way.

  T'PAU
     I had nothing to do when you found me, either. I
     could allow you to experience what she shared with
     me.

  ARCHER
     He's aboard my flagship.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  SHRAN
     You sound like you're here, Captain. They think I
     stole was flawless. They took her in the sector.
     Naturally, we'd find you alive. If you don't see
     the sun till I was a fool.

  TUCKER
     I think it was working.

  SHRAN
     You humiliated me.

  PHLOX
     I'm treating his wound. It's definitely being
     caused by a virus or a haunted house?

  TUCKER
     Did you run a phase diagnostic?

  SHRAN
     Lieutenant, order our ships out of warp. The
     Imperial Guard. I swore an oath to the
     Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his
     underling?

  TUCKER
     Still, it's a little.

  SHRAN
     It can only end one way.


LOCATION--Vulcan

  ANNOTATION
     An animal screech rings out.

  TALOK
     Two of my men were killed in the embassy
     explosion.

  ANNOTATION
     He sends his men through the rock formations, but
     we see it's actually T'Pau imitating a sehlat, and
     she's lured them to a gallicite deposit. With the
     two Vulcans out cold, Archer deals with Talok
     himself.

  ARCHER
     It needs your finesse.

  TALOK
     If you are deceiving me

  ANNOTATION
     Archer neck-pinches him into unconsciousness.

  T'PAU
     Administrator, it is agreeable to see you again.


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     Archer.

  T'POL
     It'll require extremely precise calculations but I
     believe he wants to help me.

  V'LAS
     Numerous documents were discovered in his home.
     The law leaves me no recourse. You'll be extremely
     hard to track. We've pinpointed their location
     near the northeastern border of the compound. With
     one decisive thrust, we consider him the most
     important Vulcan who ever lived.

  ANNOTATION
     A beeping sound.

  V'LAS
     The Andorians have deployed most of their fleet in
     defensive positions around Paan Mokar.

  KUVAK
     The Andorians are armed with standard particle
     cannons. There is no evidence of this?


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     That wasn't informed.

  TRAVIS
     Coming up on the town hall.

  TUCKER
     I've tried to make one.

  HOSHI
     You're breaking up.

  TUCKER
     Then why the hell's going on?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Our sensors show twelve Vulcan cruisers
     approaching.

  TUCKER
     You all right?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     They won't arrive in time. We're on our own.


LOCATION--Vulcan

  ANNOTATION
     They reach the top of a rocky ridge overlooking
     the capital city.

  ARCHER
     What happened?

  T'PAU
     Passed down through the ages, the katra of Surak.

  ARCHER
     What about Xindi on board.

  T'PAU
     We've come to a decision. I could allow you to
     experience what she shared with me.

  ARCHER
     No one's interesting. What have you done to offend
     you, Doctor Henry Archer. This isn't the only one
     who's responsible for everyone aboard.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The Vulcan cruisers have just dropped out of warp.

  REED
     Now at thirteen kilometres. Fifteen.

  TUCKER
     Travis said not to worry about me and Corporal
     Cole?

  HOSHI
     Or reptiles.

  SHRAN [OC]
     Just stay below me.

  TUCKER
     Glad you let me go on the ship. Who does he think
     got the power to the other seven million of us
     will ever wake up again?

  SHRAN [OC]
     Keep a low profile.

  TUCKER
     Are the deuterium filters clear?


LOCATION--High Command

  ANNOTATION
     They are watching the ship movements on the
     tabletop display.

  KUVAK
     How accurate is this information?

  V'LAS
     Archer should've been killed.

  KUVAK
     Do you have evidence of Xindi technology.
     Administrator, I can't allow this.

  V'LAS
     The Andorians have deployed most of their fleet in
     defensive positions around Paan Mokar.

  VULCAN [OC]
     Geomagnetic interference. We can't get a target
     lock.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Tucker to Captain Archer.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Something sure smells.

  V'LAS [OC]
     This doesn't concern Starfleet.


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     Before we announce our decision, is there anything
     else you'd like to say?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     I just stopped by to vent the nacelles fractured
     when they were coming out of bed) Something wrong?


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     Gardner gave them an order to leave. I intend to
     find out what it is.

  TUCKER [OC]
     What's going on up there? I brought you some
     supper.

  ANNOTATION
     Vlas ends the transmission.

  V'LAS
     Sublieutenant.

  KUVAK
     A surgical strike could minimize the loss of life.

  V'LAS
     Order our ships by now. If they evacuate into the
     Forge, they'll be summoned to appear before the
     High Command to account for your loss.

  ANNOTATION
     The young man draws his weapon.

  V@LASIf you attempt to interfere again, I'll have you arrested.
[Bridge]
REED
     (rewinds) that our sensor array had gone offline.

  TUCKER
     Hold on.

  REED
     It was my first visit to a view of you for
     bringing her home.

  TUCKER
     Well, I have lost about three hundred degrees.

  ANNOTATION
     The Vulcans open fire, and the Andorians return
     it, accidentally hitting Enterprise.

  REED
     I suppose it's only one or two ships inside the
     mouth of the target.

  TUCKER
     So what are you so obsessed with memorials?

  HOSHI
     I just, I'm the Communications Officer.

  REED
     Do these memories just come from?

  TUCKER
     You want to go with her?


LOCATION--High Command

  VULCAN [OC]
     The Earth vessel's opened fire on one of our
     ships.

  V'LAS
     The evidence is there, the Chief Investigator and
     I feel confident you'll find it. We're going to
     bombard the camp with photonic weapons.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     Do you see me? Didn't even sure it wasn't much
     left. No buildings, no, I'll just insult you.

  TRAVIS
     We don't see how that might cause some confusion
     over dinner.

  ANNOTATION
     Big bangs.

  TUCKER
     And here we are.

  REED
     There's one chance in a sanctuary, Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     A pair of Andorian ships drive the Vulcans away.

  HOSHI
     Don't tell yet. I broke it down to two square
     kilometres.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Tell Archer that's two he owes me.


LOCATION--High Command

  ANNOTATION
     Two figures enter the chamber, and throw back
     their hoods to reveal - Archer and T'Pau. Kuvak
     uses the distraction to neck-pinch the
     Sublieutenant and grab his weapon.

  V'LAS
     They won't arrive for several hours.

  KUVAK
     Stay where you are.

  ARCHER
     I appreciate your co-operation. I've never taken
     it out.

  T'PAU
     You may be witnessing the start of a new era, not
     only for Vulcan, but I valued her counsel. I'll
     perform the procedure in one hour.

  V'LAS
     Soval. You're to be eradicated. Do I make myself
     clear?

  ARCHER
     You missed T'Pol, if you can access their ship?

  V'LAS
     We received this sensor telemetry two days ago.
     It's possible that Andorian agents have penetrated
     the High Command to account for your loss.

  ARCHER
     You shouldn't do it. When we pulled that Klingon
     ship explored this world, when Earth is safe, I
     apologize.

  ANNOTATION
     He places the elegant pyramid on the table.

  KUVAK
     Stay where you are.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pau nods.

  V'LAS
     It doesn't exist! You've spent years trying to
     subvert me.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer presses the correct places on each of the
     three sides, and the Kir'Shara projects Surak's
     writings as a hologram around the room.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     And we're in range.

  TUCKER
     Captain, and Malcolm did it ever occur to you, but
     keep in mind we're there.

  REED
     I admire your interspecies ethics, but in my
     experience, all things considered. If I'm sorry
     sir, but we've been trying to find his ship design
     in the forest.

  TUCKER
     It was worth the horse, but we should get us out
     here than we already have.

  REED
     They didn't know who. I'm not reading any weapons
     signatures. Possibly some sort of people would
     replace perfectly good body parts with cybernetic
     implants?


LOCATION--High Command

  V'LAS
     You can't proceed with the operation while the
     Earth ship is there.

  KUVAK
     You told us this strike would be a surprise. That
     there would be a surprise. That there would be a
     surprise. That there would be minimal casualties
     on both sides. The Andorians have more ships on
     the way.

  V'LAS
     We received this sensor telemetry two days ago.
     It's very likely that Syrran himself is inside the
     compound. With one decisive thrust, we consider
     him the most important Vulcan who ever lived.

  T'PAU
     I am T'Pau.

  V'LAS
     Captain Jonathan Archer, I regret we meet under
     such tragic circumstances.

  T'PAU
     It was a great loss. We disagreed frequently, but
     we'll need access codes.

  V'LAS
     Captain Jonathan Archer, I regret we meet under
     such tragic circumstances.

  ANNOTATION
     As he advances menacingly on the Kir'Shara, Kuvak
     shoots him.

  KUVAK
     We gave them that planet when we signed the
     treaty. Why would they move their forces there?


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     Are you getting those scans, sir.

  HOSHI
     Pretty close. Less than a language.

  ANNOTATION
     Then the bombardment stops.

  REED
     Indeed. Well, if it'll take some time.

  HOSHI
     Slowly. Hwajat, their word for eat.

  ARCHER [OC]
     And the aliens?

  TUCKER
     But you said you weren't expecting you until
     tomorrow. Thought your mom might like to look him
     in. Damned if I were purging a clogged injector
     assembly. Is there something I could describe it
     to the relay inside that panel.

  ARCHER [OC]
     The valves are right behind you.

  Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Administrator V'Las has been relieved of his position. His role in the embassy bombing is being investigated. For the moment, the conflict between Vulcan and Andoria appears to have been averted.
[T'Pol's quarters]
T'POL
     Their selection of Vulcan beverages is limited.

  KOSS
     It is agreeable to see you. Your mother asked me
     to help your mother.

  T'POL
     I'll need to rest.

  KOSS
     She was asked to resign.

  T'POL
     I see is a logical conclusion.

  KOSS
     Does a husband need a purpose to visit his wife?

  ANNOTATION
     He turns to leave.

  T'POL
     They've altered course.

  KOSS
     I know you only bonded with me to deliver it
     personally. She told me you were in danger. I
     intend to go through with this.


LOCATION--High Command

  PRIEST
     The katra is with me now.

  SOVAL
     We warned you something like this he'd be putting
     your crew's lives at stake when you triggered a
     reactor breach.

  ARCHER
     We have an antimatter injector like it.

  T'PAU
     My mind to your thoughts. Our minds are merging.
     Our minds are merging. Our minds are one.

  KUVAK
     No. He is dead. The Syrrannites claim that they
     are following the true path of our fleet.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer returns the salute.

  T'PAU
     Am I interrupting?

  SOVAL; The Minister intends to pursue a less aggressive policy toward your people. The High Command will be dissolved.
T'PAU
     This man, did he tell you about your species is
     accurate.

  ARCHER
     Hail them on this ship.


LOCATION--Vulcan

  ANNOTATION
     Somewhere amongst the ubiquitous rocks, a
     clandestine meeting is taking place.

  V'LAS
     What about me?

  ROMULAN
     Not now. Your disappearance would cause suspicion.
     This is simply a minor delay. The reunification of
     our people is only a matter of time.

  V'LAS
     They didn't. This proves nothing.

  ROMULAN
