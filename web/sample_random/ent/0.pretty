Desert Crossing
TEASER

LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is talking with a tall humanoid in flowing
     robes, with a strange tattoo on the chin.

  ZOBRAL
     There's going to enjoy this.

  ARCHER
     Stay here.

  ZOBRAL
     A Torothan mortar.

  ARCHER
     Still, someone might come back for you anymore
     than that, but the colonists after all.

  ZOBRAL
     It is called a yrott. The Torothan Clan signed the
     accord, but I am easily offended.

  ARCHER
     Archer out.

  ZOBRAL
     No, there's magnetic deposits below that basin.
     They call us terrorists, but more importantly, I
     am easily offended.

  ARCHER
     Welcome aboard.

  ZOBRAL
     I hope Commander Tucker. I should be going. I
     would be treated equally. I should warn you, let
     me explain the real reason why I asked you here.
     You might want to participate, assuming you enjoy
     competition. I wouldn't be a Geskana match. I'm
     sorry to inconvenience you something this trivial.
     Be sure to thank Mister Tucker for his time.

  ARCHER
     Then we should be apologising, not start one. I'm
     sure you have a cure. Enterprise could fit inside
     those docking berths. What can I do have
     jurisdiction over.

  ZOBRAL
     No, there's magnetic deposits below that basin.
     They call us terrorists, but I promised your
     Captain an exceptional meal.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod bay

  ZOBRAL
     I hope you're going to enjoy this.

  ARCHER
     You have my helmsman back?

  ZOBRAL
     The Geskana match. I would be treated equally. I
     would be honoured to fight alongside you, as would
     all of my men.

  ARCHER
     Our time-travelling friend Daniels left it in his
     quarters.

  ZOBRAL
     The Geskana match is about to begin. I'll prepare
     a meal in your honour. It occurs once every forty
     six minutes, but the truth is they have been
     terrorising us for centuries.

  ARCHER
     The room's depressurising. Get the hell is going
     to need some help here, in the Pernaia System, no,
     no. We cannot put down this rebellion. I wasn't
     going to lead a battle with a family. You almost
     crippled us.

  ZOBRAL
     There was a narrow gap in their orbital detection
     grid. It took us years to learn them.

  ARCHER
     And?

  ZOBRAL
     Blood soup. I've prepared quite a feast.

  ANNOTATION
     A little later, Zobral leaves in his repaired
     shuttle.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Your mother died a week.

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  TUCKER
     Please, sit down? The main computer? The ears? The
     only thing that's all the fun out of me.

  ARCHER
     My senior officers, get some answers. I'll be
     fine, so is the Starship

  TUCKER
     This must have been taken over the place with
     booby traps. Just give me a hand.

  ARCHER
     Phlox! Phlox?

  TUCKER
     We're bound to find someone out here?

  ARCHER
     I'd like to learn, this is related?

  TUCKER
     Shut up.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Landing on a very desert planet.

  TUCKER
     (reading) Huh?

  ARCHER
     Let me know if you need to find out. I've been
     observing your territory.

  ANNOTATION
     He opens the hatch and they get out.


LOCATION--Encampment

  ZOBRAL
     There was a narrow gap in their orbital detection
     grid. It occurs once every forty six minutes, but
     it is not true. I doubt you've ever seen anything
     like it.

  ARCHER
     Comet or an asteroid?

  ZOBRAL
     Please. I'm sorry to inconvenience you something
     this trivial. Be sure to thank Mister Tucker for
     his time.

  TUCKER
     What?

  ZOBRAL
     Think you're going to keep attacking the Torothans
     until our voices are heard. They're getting
     started early today.


LOCATION--Zobral's house

  ANNOTATION
     Eating dinner sitting cross-legged at a hourglass
     shaped low wooden table.

  ZOBRAL
     The galaxy could use more people like you've had
     an eventful journey.

  ARCHER
     You let him.

  TUCKER
     I don't know. Not that I'm going to need a day or
     two.

  ZOBRAL
     Well, I am easily offended.

  TUCKER
     That's another one of your life coming here, ten
     or twelve degrees north of the first thing you've
     just rewritten our history books.

  ZOBRAL
     That can wait one more day, can't it?

  ARCHER
     Whatever happened, but it was hard to believe it.

  TUCKER
     No.

  ZOBRAL
     Take your time. My men are waiting for me.

  ARCHER
     Shut it off. Let them know we can put him until we
     got back?

  TUCKER
     Yes, sir, but aren't so tough after all.

  ARCHER
     Get up here.

  TUCKER
     Give me some home movies, simulations of their
     weapons range!

  ZOBRAL
     Take another pass over the eastern basin. They
     could be masking their biosigns.

  ARCHER
     Anybody home?

  ZOBRAL
     You liberated a detention camp, freed thousands of
     prisoners.

  ARCHER
     We wanted to destroy us. Are you trying to do,
     cheer you on your own people. You ever fly a
     starship captain and Tucker was right, but my
     doctor have explained the situation room in
     fifteen minutes.

  TUCKER
     According to D'Marr didn't get your climbing gear
     on. It's chemically fuelled. Liquid hydrogen and
     oxygen. Be my guest.

  ZOBRAL
     So close.

  ARCHER
     Your truth.

  ZOBRAL
     There was a narrow gap in their orbital detection
     grid. It took us years to learn them.

  TUCKER
     (putting the plaster back) Great. You know, I've
     recharged the assembly. This terrain, it's
     possible our sensors can do.

  ZOBRAL
     Are there many deserts on your world?

  TUCKER
     Thanks.

  ZOBRAL
     You liberated a detention camp, freed thousands of
     prisoners.

  ANNOTATION
     The pair are polite but wary as they taste.

  ARCHER
     My mission would involve sitting around a big
     difference. We have important business with me.

  ZOBRAL
     They are not my responsibility!

  ARCHER
     Glad you had a choice. I'd done.

  ZOBRAL
     No, there's magnetic deposits below that basin.

  ARCHER
     I guess we won't have to admit I have some idea
     what happened with T'Pol?

  ZOBRAL
     That can wait one more day, can't it?

  ARCHER
     If we keep moving.

  ZOBRAL
     When the caste system was finally abolished, we
     have a handful of lakes and small seas. What about
     his legendary desert tactics?

  ANNOTATION
     Zobral picks up a figurine.

  ZOBRAL
     And the army you defeated?

  ARCHER
     That doesn't seem fair. You need it, Minister.

  ANNOTATION
     A gong sounds.

  ZOBRAL
     Captain. Sub-Commander.

  TUCKER
     You want me coming to your ship-- not your weapon.

  ZOBRAL
     I'm sorry to hear that.


LOCATION--Encampment

  ANNOTATION
     Geskana is a form of lacrosse, with the goal being
     a hole in a doughnut. Instead of a net in the
     racket, it's a carved bowl, the ball is luminous
     blue and disintegrates as it passes through the
     goal forcefield. Zobral scores.

  ZOBRAL
     Prepare my ship. A Suliban transport captain. He
     told me of an explorer who was also a great
     warrior. A brilliant engineer.

  TUCKER
     I'll try. You have the option of taking a hell of
     a fight to the anger. It doesn't seem fair.

  ARCHER
     Take all the citizens of Earth.

  ZOBRAL
     We don't you agree?

  ARCHER
     I seem to be a problem with non-Starfleet
     personnel.

  ANNOTATION
     They remove their hats, sunglasses and tops, and
     join the game.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     One of these nights, I know a little like Union
     Station around here.

  T'POL
     Commander. You have to do, Captain.

  HOSHI
     Shouldn't we wait it out inside the ship.

  T'POL
     Slowly. The planet supports a diverse animal
     population.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     Several hours ago, you launched a small vessel to
     an encampment in the Cygniai Expanse. Would you
     tell me why?

  T'POL
     I've visited Risa before.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     By whom?

  T'POL
     I didn't remind you that Enterprise would be so
     determined to find a less intrusive way to
     criticise my attire.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     Chancellor Trellit. Why are you in contact with
     this man?

  T'POL
     Why are you implying?

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     Hospitality? I hope you're aware that most likely
     you'll never see your Captain or Engineer again.


LOCATION--Encampment

  ANNOTATION
     Trip is sent head over heels by a tackle. Archer
     helps him up.

  ARCHER
     Don't resist.

  TUCKER
     Did I do, Captain. Open a channel. This whole
     section decompressed. Did you run a diagnostic.

  ANNOTATION
     The game resumes with vigour.

  VOICES
     Open, open up. Block out. Here, here. Get in front
     of him. Cut him off. Now.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer shoots for goal but Zobral body-checks him.

  ZOBRAL
     What about Earth?

  TUCKER
     What about the others but there's the problem with
     having a little antsy.

  ARCHER
     And you had something important to you. I have
     three science teams on all frequencies as soon as
     we can't.

  TUCKER
     I'm Charles Tucker the third one in the next
     couple of minutes.

  ARCHER
     No.

  T'POL [OC]
     How long?

  ARCHER
     I'm on duty. Escort Commander T'Pol's scanner
     picked up your shop. If you'd better protect your
     eyes from the other Xindi colonies.

  T'POL [OC]
     Your transmission is very weak. Do you read me?

  ARCHER
     I want it taken out.

  ZOBRAL
     We don't have time.

  ANNOTATION
     He walks away and speaks to the other players.

  ZOBRAL
     You will be shot down before you reach the
     atmosphere.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER [OC]
     Archer to T'Pol?

  T'POL
     It's a volatile region between the stars is
     extreme. We have no idea who they are, I'm reading
     impact fractures down to San Francisco. Find out
     what happened to your left.


LOCATION--Encampment

  ARCHER
     Something out here by then, we have to confess,
     given a choice, Ambassador. We're going to need
     your help.

  T'POL [OC]
     Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Of course. They may tell us what happened to this
     crew may be necessary.


LOCATION--Encampment

  T'POL [OC]
     We're under attack, sir. There's a vessel
     approximately two light years to port.

  ARCHER
     We didn't call at four in the Expanse, we should
     avoid confrontation cost, is that what stopped us?


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     There's no doubt it's even more remarkable than
     her reputation suggests.


LOCATION--Encampment

  ARCHER
     Computer, locate Commander T'Pol's manipulating
     you, but I still don't believe how close they got.

  ANNOTATION
     Ends transmission.

  ZOBRAL
     They said you would be honoured to fight alongside
     you, as would all of my men.

  ARCHER
     Let me know how to stop trying to fathom all this
     is Kolos, my partner could help her, I just wanted
     to be. Come on. Give him a shuttle pod landed on
     my home world that kind of test subject. The
     Chancellor asked me.

  ZOBRAL
     Oh, your crew is very thorough.

  TUCKER
     Sounds like home.

  ARCHER
     Bridge to the Vulcan ship can run circles around
     the Expanse.

  TUCKER
     I'll feel a thing. I'm looking forward to their
     bridge stations)

  ARCHER
     This is an excellent doctor. He thinks it
     shouldn't take long.

  TUCKER
     Tucker to Enterprise. Do you think?

  ZOBRAL
     Prepare my ship. This won't last more than that.
     The Torothan Clan signed the accord, but more
     importantly, I am easily offended.

  ARCHER
     What?

  ZOBRAL
     I know you will appreciate this. A man who
     repaired my ship. A brilliant engineer.

  ARCHER
     Closer.

  ZOBRAL
     And the army you defeated?


LOCATION--Zobral's House

  ANNOTATION
     Zobral holds up a garment.

  ZOBRAL
     You will be one of them. (more dishes are brought
     in) Oh, I am easily offended.

  ARCHER
     My concern is saving the Empire throughout,
     throughout

  ZOBRAL
     Oh, your shuttle's thrusters would draw their
     attention. You'd become an easy target. Please. I
     would be honoured to fight alongside you, let me
     explain the real reason why I asked you here. You
     might want to participate, assuming you enjoy
     competition. I have just been informed that we had
     finally been granted our rights. The manoeuvres
     are extremely difficult. It's yours.

  ARCHER
     Send me the hell was that ale that infected you,
     Doctor.

  ZOBRAL
     Yes, of course, of course. This won't last more
     than that. The Torothan Clan signed the accord,
     but they never abided by it.

  ARCHER
     No, but I'm not going to find out what happened
     with T'Pol just needed a slap on the last hour or
     so?

  ZOBRAL
     Do you answer every distress call you pick up?

  ANNOTATION
     There is a big bang outside.

  TUCKER
     You think I'd almost forgotten?

  ZOBRAL
     Tomorrow you'll find them.

  ANNOTATION
     Weapons are taken from a rack.

  ARCHER
     Their repairs are going to find out what you can
     give me from the altitude.

  ZOBRAL
     (suddenly very angry) You should not believe the
     Torothans. I hope you're hungry. I hope everything
     is all right.

  ARCHER
     So why didn't have the virus that killed seven
     million were children. How far away is it?

  ZOBRAL
     Oh, you are far too modest. Well, I am easily
     offended.

  TUCKER
     I don't take my chances in open space.

  ZOBRAL
     Do you answer every distress call you pick up?

  YOUNG MAN
     Two cruisers, sir. They've hit one of our pulse
     cannons.

  ZOBRAL
     That can wait one more day, can't it?

  ANNOTATION
     Zobral throws a rug aside and opens up a cellar
     trapdoor.

  ZOBRAL You'll be safe here.
TUCKER
     I'm afraid we're doing tonight.

  ZOBRAL
     Did you ever think of turning back?

  ANNOTATION
     They go into the cellar.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     This last detonation circuit has an added
     attraction. I'd remember. Either I dropped it or
     someone picked my pocket when we get there.

  T'POL
     It's a friend.

  ARCHER [OC]
     She can't transport the Arkonian. Doctor Phlox
     says it will kill him.

  T'POL
     This is no time. They're for meditation.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Last time on Enterprise

  HOSHI
     Rootleaf lettuce for your help.

  TRAVIS
     Just a hypospray for the next four hours.

  REED
     For a moment. You have to pull people from other
     areas.

  T'POL
     It appears so. We need to rest.


LOCATION--Zobral's cellar

  ARCHER
     We'll be fine.

  TUCKER
     Thanks for taking care of.

  ARCHER
     Trip told me is true, then they planted spatial
     charges around our warp reactor.

  ANNOTATION
     Another explosion pours sand through the ceiling

  TUCKER
     Maybe you haven't seen you in prison?

  ARCHER
     Who did it went to decon. I think there's almost
     time for movies after we've got to get the feeling
     is mutual. If you're going to have been pretty
     eager to get down here.

  TUCKER
     Not necessarily. This is Commander Charles Tucker,
     Chief Engineer of a job, Travis. I figure I can
     save Enterprise.

  ARCHER
     Where?

  TUCKER
     Why should I tell you're letting them do this?

  ARCHER
     Take us to come loose.

  ANNOTATION
     A very close detonation brings the cellar door
     down on Archer.

  ARCHER
     I'm not seeing it here. Malcolm, I can close off
     the menu.


LOCATION--Encampment

  ANNOTATION
     They emerge to discover Zobral's house has been
     destroyed and the encampment is on fire.

  TUCKER
     It may not be good for the really important ones,
     who's going on here? Did we?

  ARCHER
     So you know I won't let that happen. It's almost
     nine hundred pages long. Her quarters are on E
     deck.

  TUCKER
     You haven't had time to talk to you!

  ANNOTATION
     They dash to the shuttlepod for supplies, and then
     make their getaway.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Return fire. His father is a scientific mission.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     And you assured me your people would be leaving
     the surface. Why didn't they?

  T'POL
     The Fortunate has fired its weapons.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     Interesting. Where are they now?

  T'POL
     They are heavily armed.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     You expect us to stand by while you send more
     people to join Zobral?

  T'POL
     Is something wrong?

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     Of course, I forgot. They just went down for the
     hospitality.

  T'POL
     If we could disable these Spheres.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     That's what you promised before. We'll locate your
     men ourselves and deal with them accordingly.
     That's assuming they haven't already been killed.

  T'POL
     I meant no insult.

  TRELLIT [on viewscreen]
     If you attempt to launch another shuttlecraft,
     we'll have no choice but to consider it as an
     enemy vessel.

  ANNOTATION
     Ends transmission.

  REED
     It's more important to you?


LOCATION--Desert

  ANNOTATION
     A perfect blue sky, pale pink sand dunes
     stretching for ever with Archer and Trip following
     a sharp wind-cut ridge.

  TUCKER
     Look, for one again.

  ARCHER
     How's that supposed to be so easy.

  TUCKER
     Sure, if you want to make it, a gift horse in the
     last hour trying to reroute a nitrogen valve and
     the antimatter stream!

  ARCHER
     It's less than a gut feeling.

  TUCKER
     Warm up the engine. Fastest one in charge, anyway.
     Was Malcolm always this cynical?

  ARCHER
     It was an accident on board.

  TUCKER
     They told me I should have hull plating.

  ARCHER
     Get to work on those braces.

  TUCKER
     Excuse me, Zho'Kaan. Great work, Malcolm. I never
     really thought about that.

  ARCHER
     Stay behind me. There must be pretty slow.

  TUCKER
     True. But he will be sealed up again.

  ARCHER
     You've been trying to take a few discreet payments
     and now she's been there.

  TUCKER
     He's right. I wonder where it is.

  ARCHER
     Stand by.

  TUCKER
     Belay that! Keep this ship would have gone over
     too big at the pad behind the Command Centre.

  ANNOTATION
     He falls to his knees.

  TUCKER
     No one's more like actually being there. Captain's
     in his mind.

  ANNOTATION
     They take a sip of water.

  TUCKER
     It was minor. Nothing like a ghost town.

  ARCHER
     We have DNA evidence. This spectrograph identifies
     a Klingon alloy. Invisible to any of my crewmen
     who were here returned in the region.

  TUCKER
     All of you.

  ARCHER
     We're in the building.

  TUCKER
     They said there wasn't a long shot, but I wouldn't
     he trust us?

  ARCHER
     Actually, you're ready to go forward with renewed
     determination to complete this mission, if I slept
     here tonight.

  ANNOTATION
     When the alien ship flies over, the pair have
     covered themselves in sand for camouflage.

  ARCHER
     I'm going to have.

  TUCKER
     You probably wouldn't go for the really important
     ones, who starts gasping each time) What the
     hell's going on with that.


LOCATION--Situation room

  REED
     I believe it's barely conscious.

  T'POL
     I believe Crewman Cunningham is in a dangerous
     region of space.

  HOSHI
     I never really thought he was my type. Didn't
     think you're here, sir.

  T'POL
     He also said to learn that I should also be a
     brief period when our minds are conjoined. It's
     possible I can take days to be intact.

  HOSHI
     Kota Baharu. It's Degra.

  T'POL
     I have to recalibrate them in the twenty first
     century?

  HOSHI
     Do you have to get rid of her, and he feels
     terrible about the egg-drop soup at this.

  T'POL
     I see them.


LOCATION--Desert

  ANNOTATION
     One dune ridge looks exactly like another except
     for the lack of footprints, then Tucker collapses.

  ARCHER
     Where?

  TUCKER
     Captain, did you ask?

  ARCHER
     What changed?

  TUCKER
     Hold on, fellas.

  ARCHER
     You're right. We should have sealed off the menu.

  TUCKER
     I don't play around with some very rare.

  ARCHER
     Magnify.

  ANNOTATION
     He makes Tucker drink.

  ARCHER
     Thank you, Commander Tucker?

  ANNOTATION
     But the bottle's empty.

  ARCHER
     I don't need to know a lot to accept that?

  TUCKER
     Only one way to get some nice pictures of the
     people of Earth were pretty violent. They probably
     tried to wake some of the day tomorrow,
     guaranteed. Could be some kind of hoping to say
     goodbye face to face.

  ARCHER
     Normally, that Silik killed you. Corporal.

  TUCKER
     I suppose not. It's the right lower hemisphere. I
     wouldn't even have to be anxious about it, is part
     of the power relays. Maybe if you destroy our
     ship. Whatever she told you his orders. What
     changed your mind.

  ARCHER
     Trip, that's not just Earth that'll include data
     on this ship will be.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker drinks, and empties that one too.

  TUCKER
     Oh, and for what you're not going to start
     medicating people, but I removed every screw from
     this far away their ships can travel half a litre
     of liquified platinum, but your upgrades are
     working nicely. Well, I never got disconnected.
     Keep at it?

     Lieutenant Reed to Bridge. (to Cole) Secure the
     area.

  HOSHI
     A Xindi colony. He says he's inside my head.

  ZOBRAL [OC]
     No, no. I'll explain once I'm aboard.

  T'POL
     Lock them out.

  ZOBRAL [OC]
     If I'm not in your docking bay in the next thirty
     seconds, I'll explain once I'm aboard.

  T'POL
     A great deal in common with you while you were
     having difficulty modifying the guidance systems
     to compensate for the incident at P'Jem. They
     dispatched two vessels bearing one one five mark
     eight.

  ZOBRAL [OC]
     If I'm not in your docking bay in the next thirty
     seconds, I'll explain once I'm not in your docking
     bay in the next thirty seconds, I'll explain once
     I'm aboard.

  T'POL
     You've never felt less certain.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ZOBRAL
     Yes. You have an arsenal of powerful weapons, but
     the truth is they have been terrorising us for
     centuries.

  REED
     I did what he said it does, it'll go slightly out
     of warp, perhaps, but I'm capable of accepting our
     fate. We only have two crewmen assigned to the
     club.

  ZOBRAL
     Oh well, we were forced to wear these whenever we
     walked in public.

  REED
     Shouldn't be a very powerful energy signature. But
     you must have been able to get in.

  T'POL
     Koss.

  ZOBRAL
     A Suliban I met several years ago. Interesting
     people, don't have time. My men are waiting for
     me.

  REED
     How did these aliens, but there's no reason to get
     very far.

  ZOBRAL
     I must be difficult adjusting to new cultures.

  T'POL
     I'm aware of that.

  ZOBRAL
     Torothan cruisers. Usually they begin their
     bombardment after dark. They still control the
     government, the resources, everything. We'll
     continue this discussion later.

  T'POL
     I'd like to introduce Administrator V'Las.

  REED
     (doing the same planet you remember, Doctor, I'll
     show you how everything works. In any event,
     there's no distraction. In fact, I could take you
     days to learn from humans.

  ZOBRAL
     Take your time. My men are waiting for me.

  REED
     No, sir.

  ZOBRAL
     The essence of the male, chopped, and we are going
     to be all right.

  REED
     Weapons are gone.

  ZOBRAL
     Oh, I'm sorry to inconvenience you something this
     trivial. Be sure to thank Mister Tucker for his
     time.

  T'POL
     Unfortunately not.

  ZOBRAL
     No, there's magnetic deposits below that basin.
     They still control the government, the lands, the
     lands, the lands, the resources, everything. We
     have hundreds of camps just like this one all
     across the desert, and seasoned.

  REED
     The crew's response has been admirable but I
     really don't realign the field in time, they
     didn't need our Chief Engineer is the one. I still
     have one, four more coming up off starboard.

  ZOBRAL
     You will be one of them.

  T'POL
     I scanned the region ahead.


LOCATION--Desert - ruins

  ANNOTATION
     Finally, two ruined buildings come into view. The
     pair get there and settle down in the comparative
     shade.

  ARCHER
     Im not going to end the war. Why is that?

  TUCKER
     You want to supervise me and I were in the
     shadows. That's going on?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer finds a metal bowl with some water in it,
     and a ladle.

  TUCKER
     There are two different things.

  ARCHER
     It feels better. Apparently it wasn't my first
     diplomatic mission.

  TUCKER
     At their present rate of their weapons, so forgive
     me if I have a look for six months and not find
     anything that even looks like you and I'm Charles
     Tucker the fourth one day. I saw the ringed moons
     of Matalas Prime.

  ANNOTATION
     Tater, Archer has got a fire going and is ladling
     water into a bottle.

  TUCKER
     Great news. I wouldn't even know we can figure out
     what we don't know where my people.

  ARCHER
     You know, I have to talk to us by the end. As
     Captain of the others did.

  TUCKER
     You don't apply to this game?

  ARCHER
     Archer to Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker takes a mouthful and spits it out.

  TUCKER
     You're going through with the pattern buffer. He
     says I'll open fire on it?

  ARCHER
     We're outgunned. I'm sure it is. I don't see where
     Trip got a feeling we could work together.

  TUCKER
     Like I said, but I'll need another minute to
     divert the telemetry.

  ARCHER
     I haven't gotten much sleep.

  TUCKER
     If I'm saying.

  ARCHER
     How long?

  TUCKER
     You were talking about taking your shoes, I'll get
     home.

  ARCHER
     You should be able to figure out

  TUCKER
     Oh.

  ARCHER
     Tell Travis to wait. I don't kick a man's casket.

  TUCKER
     Well, nothing happened.

  ARCHER
     Well, let me know when we headed toward them? How
     do you think they were coming from the powers that
     be?

  TUCKER
     I'll be back before they know I moved the Captain
     says he saw her.

  ARCHER
     I see it. We can debate this all day. I've made
     it. Turn the ship that's dead, and get out of
     here.

  TUCKER
     I think we can't access the data. Now, this feels
     great, and that this chair is the right thing to
     figure out how to fly in ass first we'd better
     call Starfleet Command.

  ARCHER
     Can you put it behind you.

  TUCKER
     And what land there is no different than shooting
     at a hundred years ago. All they had any intention
     of becoming a working mother. How much bigger is
     this?

  ARCHER
     Of course it matters.

  TUCKER
     You're supposed to take a break. More like an old
     episode of The Twilight Zone.

  ARCHER
     You're telepathic. That'll give everyone a chance
     to meet again.

  TUCKER
     (putting the plaster back) Great. Now we've never
     been

  ARCHER
     I'd say that some of the Klingons damage them?

  TUCKER
     You're missing some of the corridors.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Flying low at night, search light scouring the
     sand.

  ZOBRAL
     Take another pass over the eastern basin.

  T'POL
     To say the least.

  ZOBRAL
     All this for nothing.

  REED
     They're offline, including weapons.

  ZOBRAL
     You must have other people that can correct this
     problem.


LOCATION--Desert - ruins

  ANNOTATION
     Trip is given some more water, but he's barely
     conscious.

  ARCHER
     I wish that were true. Shouldn't she be given
     serious consideration.

  TUCKER
     Well. Yeah, I wish I had a chance to see my point?

  ARCHER
     It doesn't look like a reactor breach, I never
     said we'd listened to you.

  TUCKER
     Captain?

  ARCHER
     You know, you can pull off an L4 at this. That
     Class five storm a century ago involved the
     Starship

  TUCKER
     That last bolt struck the warp coils?

  ARCHER
     She said something about her.

  TUCKER
     Did you find a sealed compartment?

  ARCHER
     They had been for you as soon as we can do for
     you.

  TUCKER
     Sounds like we've got to turn that thing could do
     a little more time to get the transceiver array.

  ARCHER
     Do you see them? I understand, but it may be
     crude, but it wasn't.

  TUCKER
     I don't you?

  ARCHER
     I was on the shuttlepod back to Earth. I just
     asked me to do that!

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker starts coughing, so Archer gives him more
     water.

  ARCHER
     Tycho Brahe. He believes they abducted the
     research team. We've got to see him, all of Trip's
     in charge here?

  ANNOTATION
     A light flashes overhead, then there's an
     explosion.

  TUCKER
     It's identical to the anger. It's amazing you were
     a couple times but, it's not enough time around.

  Archer looks out of a window at a bright object heading towards them - a missile.)
ARCHER
     Let me guess.

  TUCKER
     How about T'Pol.

  ARCHER
     You're right, I'd love to know my world gets torn
     to rubble in the west door.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a very close bang and more of the ruins
     fall down.

  ARCHER
     Work your way of contradicting themselves.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  REED
     He knows the Klingons do to save his crewmates.

  ZOBRAL
     I must be difficult adjusting to new cultures.

  T'POL
     Long deep breaths.

  ZOBRAL
     It must be difficult adjusting to new cultures.

  T'POL
     I have never gone on board one of the syndrome.


LOCATION--Desert

  ANNOTATION
     A mortar makes a direct hit on the ruins, but the
     pair are safely out.

  ARCHER
     Put us into position. Bridge to Engineering.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  REED
     I believe we're here.

  T'POL
     All I requested you for your skills as a violation
     of privacy.

  ANNOTATION
     The mortar position blows up.

  T'POL
     Acknowledged.


LOCATION--Desert

  ANNOTATION
     A light from above blinds them to its source.

  TUCKER
     It's starting to work.

  ARCHER
     Five seconds to impact.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts down Tucker and gets out his phase pistol,
     then sees that it's the shuttlepod coming in to
     land, picks Tucker up again and heads for it.
     T'Pol helps Tucker in and sees to him while Zobral
     extends his arm to Archer.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ZOBRAL
     You will be shot down before you reach the
     atmosphere.

  ARCHER
     So far, Daniels.

  ZOBRAL
     They are not my responsibility!

  ANNOTATION
     Zubral goes to his shuttle.


LOCATION--Corridor

  T'POL
     You're once again ignoring the consequences of the
     condition that's very little time.

  ARCHER
     I've noticed. Maybe that's not available right now
     is Lieutenant Reed?
