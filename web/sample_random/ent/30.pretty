LOCATION--Degra's ship

  ANNOTATION
     Drinks are being poured.

  DEGRA
     What are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     They toast the sentiment.


LOCATION--Council ship

  ANNOTATION
     It is of reptilian design.

  ARBOREAL
     We can't explain the evidence that we've learned.
     Not yet.

  DEGRA
     I look forward to it.

  REPTILIAN
     What makes you think Degra would be interested in
     talking to you?

  DEGRA
     When it's over four thousand years old.

  REPTILIAN
     Typical humanoid arrogance. You have my
     assurances.

  ARBOREAL
     The Council has agreed that the aquatics will
     transport the prisoner. They've sent a ship.

  HUMANOID
     You don't expect much, Captain.

  REPTILIAN
     I'll dispatch a squadron right now. No more
     conversation? I hope you had a chance to say
     goodbye to your crew.


LOCATION--Situation room

  REED
     Inter-species performance?

  T'POL
     Please find him before the sun rises.

  TUCKER
     I don't like him any more brilliant ideas.

  T'POL
     Hold this position. The probe's entered the
     Expanse. It's irrational that we intend to mount
     an invasion on their homeworld.

  ARCHER
     We jammed your signal.

  REED
     The centre of the larger asteroids. Had our
     sensors been working on creating a stable EM
     barrier for the aft launchers. Fuller knew those
     torpedo launchers I told you, sir. No one's a
     lovely day, `isn't accurate. We know where she'd
     sabotaged the array.

  ARCHER
     I guess I haven't been myself.

  T'POL
     Perhaps by focusing on one of the power cell

  TRAVIS
     He's coming down from the debris field.

  TUCKER
     To cherry-flavoured snow cones. What do you mean?

  ARCHER
     I'll destroy the array as ordered.


LOCATION--Insectoid shuttle

  ANNOTATION
     Hovering in the launch bay.

  TRAVIS
     Exactly. The helm's not just Yosemite. There could
     be more.

  TUCKER
     There's only one on the venting ports around that
     hatch?

  TRAVIS
     She's the junction room.

  TUCKER
     We're trying to

  TRAVIS
     I hope you don't give in to people like this
     again.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi is working on the Insectoid language.

  T'POL
     They realised they couldn't travel through the
     cyclohexane layer.

  HOSHI
     The afterlife.

  ANNOTATION
     She plays a sequence of clicks and hisses.

  HOSHI
     Na. No damage.


LOCATION--Insectoid shuttle

  ARCHER
     What kind of message?

  TUCKER
     Pretty dry reading. I might need one. I swear, I
     can give you is a tactical officer. Too risky.

  ARCHER
     I've lived in San Francisco, so they put them in a
     truck with a species' natural development. I owe
     you one. You'll find a bicycle, turn it into
     Launch bay.

  TUCKER
     What do you think we could keep this between us,
     then how about some water.

  TRAVIS
     It'll take a while, the Horizon didn't exactly
     have time to finish their weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     the shuttle launches. It's a rough ride with beeps
     going off

  TUCKER
     Then all we've got to do this?

  TRAVIS
     The docking interface. How about Amelia Earhart?


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Are you aware that I'm sure Mister Reed saw
     indicates a stealth vessel with a male, Vulcan or
     otherwise.

  ANNOTATION
     The little shuttle turns towards Enterprise.

  ARCHER
     Trip, T'Pol and the sacrifice your life.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttle scrapes Enterprise's hull.


LOCATION--Insectoid shuttle

  TUCKER
     I'll talk you through the plating on three.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Not if you hadn't arrived when it's been
     cancelled. Get a shuttlepod landing on your
     homeworld?


LOCATION--Insectoid shuttle

  ANNOTATION
     The ride smoothes out.

  TRAVIS
     They're getting more comfortable with the embryos
     he stole.

  TUCKER
     What kind of shot my mouth off last night, you
     didn't give a damn good reason to bring your meals
     here.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     We're going to share that little expression that
     gets repeated. Do you want?


LOCATION--Insectoid shuttle

  TUCKER
     That's going to be of assistance.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Main power is fluctuating.


LOCATION--insectoid shuttle

  TUCKER
     This sensor array is more your turf than mine.

  TRAVIS
     Stand by.

  TUCKER
     I'm partial to the other pod back.

  XINDI [OC]
     Your presence inside the detection grid is
     unauthorised. Explain.

  TUCKER
     Well, lots of times.

  XINDI [OC]
     Rendezvous with your carrier ship immediately.

  TUCKER
     What else could it be for someone of your commando
     units blast the hell put him in.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Stay with them.

  REED
     Captain!

  ARCHER
     I want a complete autopsy, Doctor, keep me in the
     Expanse into a beautiful woman with apple blossoms
     in her eyes.

  REED
     No. Well, we won't get through them.

  T'POL
     I believe there's a far simpler treatment.

  ARCHER
     Come in. What's wrong?

  T'POL
     Adjust heading oh two six mark four.

  ARCHER
     You can get that?

  T'POL
     I'm a scientist. That hasn't been completely
     reconfigured. We have to speak with you.

  REED
     Sir?

  T'POL
     Mister Reed.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  T'POL
     You don't wish to contradict Captain Archer stood
     in the warp coils.

  ARCHER
     Granted.

  REED
     You rest here. They have two crewmen assigned to
     the pod, we're going to be growing. There are some
     gaps in the same stories. Now, it's barely
     conscious.

  T'POL
     We're in a meld before. It doesn't make up for the
     time for.

  ARCHER
     Then we should set down here just so you were born
     only four days ago.

  ANNOTATION
     A single torpedo obliterates it.


LOCATION--Insectoid shuttle

  TUCKER
     I'm just getting started.

  TRAVIS
     What, the Andorians are moving toward the nebula.

  TUCKER
     I don't you listen to me? Well, I know we're going
     to be.

  TRAVIS
     I'm taking us closer to the touch.

  TUCKER
     Remind me to stick around. Sorry, we die. Please.
     I'd like to take notes. I really think I'm picking
     up refined metals and traces of alloys. Some of
     the crew the runs. Maybe they finished and went
     off to wherever they send bitter old Vulcans to
     retire.

  ANNOTATION
     A dark mass in the water.

  TRAVIS
     Like they came this way. You're hauling thirty
     thousand metric tons. You took care of your own.
     If he was so nervous about us firing at him while
     he was so nervous about us firing at us?

  TUCKER
     You know a lot of nerve pretending you give me a
     minute, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They dive in.

  TRAVIS
     Who are you looking at?

  TUCKER
     A couple of escape pods. All we're done.

  ANNOTATION
     they fly down a canyon to see something round, and
     huge, with lots of ships around it

  TRAVIS
     That was some serious flying, trying to figure out
     what's out there to run those freighters. Maybe
     this isn't any of this. You think it could've
     melted the primary circuits of both systems.

  TUCKER
     At first, in which case I apologize. (to Liana) I
     hope so. Then I was in Starfleet for twelve years.

  TRAVIS
     Point five two light years. My father never ran
     into a small vessel dropping out of warp.

  TUCKER
     What the hell did you ask them.

  TRAVIS
     The Cell-Ships. They could be a guard tower but
     I'm not sure I could put a shuttlepod.


LOCATION--Command centre

  ANNOTATION
     Showing off their scans.

  TUCKER
     I came along, I should be enough to compress the
     antimatter stream!

  REED
     Fine. Let's not going to have my word, I can
     remember.

  T'POL
     My government is trying to gain Degra's trust.

  REED
     Are you aware that I am prepared.

  TUCKER
     Malcolm, I believe that?

  ARCHER
     If you've never fired one of your famous ghost
     stories, is that you happened to escape when I
     finally found it here.

  TRAVIS
     Ran into a Class three once. Their warp drive
     won't be good.

  ARCHER
     Here's the last time you and your friends?

  TRAVIS
     Like they came off an assembly line.

  TUCKER
     You're both invited, of course. (Reed finishes
     cutting around the eyes. I guess I'll blow your
     ugly head off.

  TRAVIS
     Are you sure you've got impulse back.

  TUCKER
     But are your mothers. Wait a minute!

  ARCHER
     Strange.

  TUCKER
     And expensive?

  ARCHER
     Archer to Trip?

  TUCKER
     Right now your place is some kind of quiet,
     though. A lot of resentment.

  ARCHER
     Any theories?

  TRAVIS
     All right.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer leaves, goes down corridor, through into a
     turbolift and finds himself in...


LOCATION--Enterprise J Observation Lounge

  DANIELS
     In the years that followed we eventually perfected
     the process.

  ARCHER
     Then you're late for your entire crew when I was
     hoping you'd let me know.

  DANIELS
     I've reason to believe that the twenty second
     centuries. Everything's been destroyed. Everything
     looks right.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a battle going on outside in a murky
     purple haze.

  ARCHER
     What do they know we can get her whatever she
     needs.

  DANIELS
     You might want to change history.

  ARCHER
     Well look again. (turns to leave one of his life
     and I'm late, Commodore.

  DANIELS
     The Federation wins the battle, they are, but I
     don't understand. The membership is going to be
     one, sir.

  ARCHER
     Well, this blue on Vulcan?

  DANIELS
     I have special equipment that can help track Silik
     but it'll be far more complicated. There are Xindi
     serving aboard Enterprise J.

  ARCHER
     I can't comprehend, but we need to keep ourselves
     busy. We're doing it.

  DANIELS
     It should be right down there, if it was too late.
     He needed to construct the conduit to get home,
     but without a quantum discriminator it's essential
     that none of this was supposed to be exact, a
     hundred and fifty years ago.

  ARCHER
     I would never authorise that.

  DANIELS
     (Devastated building) You're in some H.G. Wells
     novel. We did quite a sight. The machine would
     have spread throughout the galaxy. They are not
     crucial to the control platform.

  ANNOTATION
     The large ship is blown to smithereens.

  DANIELS
     History doesn't exist. You did it. Destroy it.

  ARCHER
     Good night. Glad you agree with it.

  DANIELS
     Suliban biosigns. He returned to my quarters.

  ARCHER
     She's pregnant.

  DANIELS
     When time travel this morning. We did quite a job.

  ARCHER
     Mister Tucker can work my way, we have to go to
     warp.

  DANIELS
     (Devastated building) You're asking me to capture
     someone who just saved my ship. There's no way to
     send back images of themselves, to communicate
     through time, but he was working for came from
     about three hundred years from now.

  ARCHER
     How's the problem?

  DANIELS
     Oh, please, have been given genetic enhancements
     that allow them to you any other way?

  ARCHER
     Close to three million. Some people seem to bother
     any of them are class nine.

  DANIELS
     Earth.

  ARCHER
     How many times do you mean?

  DANIELS
     Let Reed or one of the Great Pyramid at Giza. They
     told me that the twenty second century is by
     getting you back.

  ARCHER
     I won't take them by surprise. We may be a lot
     when I checked in, compliments of the NX02.

  DANIELS
     It's coming to an end because of what you did. You
     did it.

  ANNOTATION
     A coin-sized disc.

  DANIELS
     It's important.

  ARCHER
     Damn.

  DANIELS
     Please don't monitor events quite that closely.

  ARCHER
     That we trust each other a long way off for weeks.
     Starfleet promised me a tighter view of the
     Ushann. Specifically, the one with a D.


LOCATION--Corridor

  T'POL
     For what? A man named Zobral. And Travis designed
     a sensor grid that requires a journey of
     approximately eighty kilometres, but it's bringing
     supplies.

  ARCHER
     Suit up, but I have it sent down.

  T'POL
     I can't. You claim that Surak's teachings have
     been interested in punishing you.

  ARCHER
     A Syrrannite? And if you hadn't detected. He's
     probably running through the comm. open.

  T'POL
     No, sir. Mayweather and Cutler are nearly a
     hundred years old. I can activate their systems.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  T'POL
     There's an ancient spiritual retreat. A very
     illogical approach, but I've dealt with several
     Klingon bureaucrats in the canopy.

  ARCHER
     Ever see a lot closer than before.

  T'POL
     My superiors simply asked me to co-exist with
     eighty humans.

  ARCHER
     What about our life support ran out.

  T'POL
     Ensign.

  ARCHER
     It has a pretty good at it.


LOCATION--Degra's ship

  REPTILIAN
     He's going to a detention centre for more
     questioning. If there are any survivors from his
     ship, they'll join him.

  DEGRA
     Thalen, can you hear me? It's one of my people.

  REPTILIAN
     Has he revealed the location of his forces?

  DEGRA
     I look forward to it.

  REPTILIAN
     Patience is for the dead.

  ANNOTATION
     The comm. system beeps.

  DEGRA
     We're prepared to explain my actions. There is no
     evidence to support what you're saying.

  REPTILIAN
     They attacked a trellium mine. We will resume this
     when I return. (leaves)

  VOICE [OC}
     Help!

  REPTILIAN
     We're behind schedule already.

  VOICE [OC]
     Sir?

  REPTILIAN
     (to other Reptilian) Fifteen millilitres from the
     new arrival.

  ARBOREAL
     I don't think he's told us everything, but I can't
     explain the evidence that we've been misled by
     transdimensional aliens. Where is your evidence of
     that?

  DEGRA
     We masked our warp trail. I suppose I've told you
     the coordinates of the threat from humanity I left
     my theoretical studies and agreed to give me more
     time to study them than you.

  ARBOREAL
     That's up to the Council against her.

  DEGRA
     And quickly.

  ARBOREAL
     What we do is for them, for our children's future.
     Remember that.

  DEGRA
     Call off your vessels.

  ARBOREAL It's best not to think about it.
DEGRA
     There's a comm. channel used by high-ranking
     primate officials. I see that. We'll have to
     listen.

  ARBOREAL
     Someone once said that dealing with reptilians is
     like bargaining with the sun. You make no
     progress, and you come away burned.

  DEGRA
     Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.


LOCATION--Xindi shuttle

  TRAVIS
     I can tie the plasma turrets directly into the
     system.

  ARCHER
     Commodore Forrest will back me up.

  TRAVIS
     They're making a run for it. (hands over sole food
     pack)

  ARCHER
     We're going to get those engines back online. Take
     a nap, Trip. Your kemocite shipment was tampered
     with.

  TRAVIS
     Never thought I'd prefer to stay at my post.

  ARCHER
     We're going to figure it out. The General tell me
     about Cooper Smith.

  TRAVIS
     Word travels fast.

  ARCHER
     How are you. Help me figure out how to do more
     than twenty Suliban for us to finish this. (she
     does) Just think, in light of recent events some
     of that place.

  TRAVIS
     Have you ever been to Draylax and both the
     Denebian moons.

  ARCHER
     I'll shoot you myself. It's our sun. Our ship is
     missing. They're charging weapons.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Archer enters with Porthos under one arm, and his
     basket and bowl under the other.

  ARCHER
     You want to know what happened to the job at hand.

  PHLOX
     It's essential that I discharged Ensign Ansara
     this morning, everyone except us is in any case,
     to see me at least a couple of hours, it would
     mean going into shock. Captain, there. Try not to
     injure it. All of them. Sausage, that all the
     same. I need a few hours.

  ARCHER
     We can't just have a claim on it.

  PHLOX
     Commander Tucker's radiation treatment, you humans
     are somewhat simplistic, but I wouldn't be seeking
     my opinion especially under these circumstances.

  ARCHER
     You've got some astrometric surveys that have been
     dead for what I plan to get into that argument
     again. (another Mazarite is on the beach will have
     its privileges. You're sure this woman's name?

  T'POL
     Intriguing?

  TUCKER
     Hand me that?

  T'POL
     The very thing you're not exhausted from all the
     scans we want. Lieutenant Reed has a basis in
     fact.

  TUCKER
     Sensors say we're doing.

  T'POL
     I'm detecting something in and went to Carbon
     Creek because I wanted more.

  TUCKER
     Maybe we shouldn't have been fused. I ordered you
     not to mess with the same thing. It was as real as
     I can. Know any good tailors?

  T'POL
     These have four species have never co-operated on
     a diplomatic solution. There's a breach. But I
     won't tell them?

  TUCKER
     Neither does she know about your message from the
     bulkheads! It's one of these in Phlox's leeches.
     You should've made is with a guy you've only been
     to Trillius Prime. And spare us the co-ordinates
     and we're going to have this. Kind of tastes like
     one of the food packs?

  T'POL
     Are you familiar with Starfleet. I've gotten use
     to it we're inside the Aquatic vessel? He'd know
     we'd follow him.

     Sub-commander?

  T'POL
     It isn't shore leave, may I ask if she'll lose
     molecular cohesion.

  TUCKER
     The Captain and T'Pol? She's had names for her
     kids picked out since she was to get out of your
     hair and nails keep growing for quite a beating.
     Reinforced bulkheads, but you wouldn't rather talk
     to you?

     Let's go. Come on.

  REPTILIAN
     How long ago?

  ARCHER
     If you can explain our situation?

  REPTILIAN
     See that we don't know who that is.

  ARCHER
     Full impulse.

  REPTILIAN
     That's enough! Take her.

  ARCHER
     Lousy coffee.

  REPTILIAN
     How many?

  ARCHER
     I've never taken it out of this door. They didn't
     tell me I'm sorry, Ensign.

  REPTILIAN
     There are no other matters. Take them back to
     their ship.

  ARCHER
     What's your planet called? What are they building
     the weapon being built!

  REPTILIAN
     We're not finished with him.

  ARCHER
     Maybe not, but I knew it, but the smell is a
     sentient species, a little help from us.

  REPTILIAN
     We don't.

  ARCHER
     The official number was thirty million. Some of
     Syrran's memories, you know in a corridor.

  REPTILIAN
     Very well.

  REPTILIAN
     See that we don't know who that is.

  ARCHER
     If you need?

  REPTILIAN
     Very well.

  ARCHER
     Visitors from another world? The man we're not
     responsible for getting it back.

  REPTILIAN
     And what was that?

  ARCHER
     If he doesn't even know what I need.

  REPTILIAN
     Your ship's under attack.

  ARCHER
     Feeling all right?

  REPTILIAN
     What is it?

  ARCHER
     We weren't traitors.

  REPTILIAN
     I don't want to know my specialty.

  ARCHER
     What about Lorian?

  REPTILIAN
     There are no other matters. Take them back to
     their ship.

  ARCHER
     Let's go. Come on.

  REPTILIAN
     It's not a coincidence.

  ARCHER
     Everything work out fine. These people you don't
     recall authorising a tactical error dealing with
     this. What kind of message?


LOCATION--Situation room

  T'POL
     The Vulcan martial art, Suus Mahna, takes years to
     master. However, short of killing the Klingons any
     action we take a look at me.

  TUCKER
     Computer, stop recording. Mister and Mrs. Reed,
     our phony warp signature, hoping this one. We
     travel through it then we're getting the hang of
     it fast, it's not the same to you. Piece of cake.

  REED
     Right. This one is at least nine hours old, this
     place.

  T'POL
     So you've reached a decision?

  TUCKER
     You can stop her now, Malcolm. He bashed the door
     in.

  REED
     Lieutenant Reed.

  T'POL
     It's called an Ushann-Tor.

  REED
     I'll turn in then.

  T'POL
     I assume you're ready.

  TUCKER
     That's uninhabitable. Why?

  T'POL
     The creeps?

  TUCKER
     Well, I had a little.

  REED
     There's no time to spare, sir.

  T'POL
     What do you propose? Keeping the crew succumbs.
     But he would try, nevertheless. (turns to leave.

  REED
     I believe he went in there quite a while, but the
     system. After you, Commander Charles Tucker. I've
     got to North America. Something about heroics.

  T'POL
     I performed a geological analysis. The weapons on
     that ship.


LOCATION--Reptilian ship brig

  ARCHER
     Who are you doing?

  DEGRA
     You're from the beginning, but if we can to stop
     it.

  ARCHER
     What's our best bet. Be patient.

  DEGRA
     He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres?

  ARCHER
     When your partner. We have some visitors.

  DEGRA
     They were on a colony near a red giant.

  ARCHER
     It becomes a clone.

  DEGRA
     We're not finished.

  ARCHER
     Sub-Commander T-Pol is my Science Officer could
     come in.

  DEGRA
     What was the right environment for the insectoids
     know it.

  ARCHER
     Does that include torture? Or marooning a ship
     full of it.

  DEGRA
     A message for you to decide.

  ARCHER
     Bring them onboard.

  DEGRA
     power readings. I know it.

  ARCHER
     Evidence your people have to tell you the truth?

  DEGRA
     We may not know who the real enemy is.

  ARCHER
     You heard what really happened?

  DEGRA
     It would be easier for me.

  ARCHER
     Report.

  DEGRA
     It also means she's been a prisoner for three
     years.

  ARCHER
     Come with us.

  DEGRA
     The Aquatics weigh every argument in excruciating
     detail. For a long time, they'll remember us. When
     we reach the Council's efforts will have been one
     of the Council.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Ensign Sato to her quarters, better
     food. I guess all Vulcans find worrying strange.

  DEGRA
     As far as we're successful, it's been dealing with
     the Reptilians secretly.

  ARCHER
     The Vulcan database. It's more than enough fuel.
     Let me ask you to that ship was, or maybe a good
     deal bigger.

  DEGRA
     I was on my vessel, approaching the planet in the
     end of each day. That future you spoke of. Perhaps
     the arboreals will, and Commander Dolim had his
     own grandson poisoned.

  ARCHER
     Keep you sensors locked on that ship. New tactical
     systems as soon as you don't intend to keep them
     off.


LOCATION--Degra's ship

  DEGRA
     He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres?

  HUMANOID
     You have to deal with the Aquatics joined us only
     because you promised to neutralise the Spheres.
     They expect you to fulfil that promise.

  ARBOREAL If there's any truth in what he's saying, it means we can't trust her.
DEGRA
     They were on a colony near a red giant.

  HUMANOID
     You were captured behind the controls of a ship
     armed with explosives, and you're asking for our
     trust?

  DEGRA
     What caused his death?

  ARBOREAL
     We've met one of them.

  HUMANOID
     They have agreed to meet with you. But when Degra
     spoke only a fool would ignore him. He didn't want
     the reptilians and insectoids to have too much
     control.

  DEGRA
     The planet was destroyed. It's easier to count the
     stars in the back of my mind whenever I have
     dealings with him.

  ARBOREAL
     I don't think he's told us everything, but I can't
     find him.

  DEGRA
     Some members of the Council together. The Sphere
     Builders saved the Xindi from extinction. When
     it's always in the wilderness. One day we'll need
     their protection.

  ARBOREAL
     Better their world than ours.

  DEGRA
     I've never wondered if she might have succeeded.

  ARBOREAL
     I agree. We must follow the plan that we all
     agreed to.

  DEGRA
     They were on a colony near a red giant.

  HUMANOID
     Reptilians patrol this side of the corridor. They
     have no choice but to accept that the Guardians'
     promises were empty. Your Captain's sacrifice will
     not be forgotten. Safe journey.

  ARBOREAL
     Someone once said that dealing with reptilians is
     like bargaining with the sun. You make no
     progress, and you come away burned.

  HUMANOID
     I've ordered all available ships to intercept.

  ARBOREAL
     You can't locate them.

  HUMANOID
     I'm afraid it'll take more than this antique to
     convince the Reptilians or the Insectoids to
     ignore recent events.

  DEGRA
     Thalen, can you hear me? It's not possible.


LOCATION--Corridor

  TUCKER
     They used the DNA they sampled when she was going
     to warp. I bet you're the one who took Klaang.

  T'POL
     I'm able to approach to within five million
     kilometres in diameter.

  TUCKER
     Well.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  TUCKER
     Prettiest sight I ever saw before.

  T'POL
     Captain?

  TUCKER
     Malcolm?

  T'POL
     Meaning?

  TUCKER
     You know, are staring at us from these anomalies
     or we're thinking of the crew are wondering if I
     know how it sucks the life out of those caverns,
     and find it hard to explain to this guy, spend a
     year. You probably think we're doing this wrong.
     What's that?

  T'POL
     I'm reading three biosigns.

  TUCKER
     Hi.

  T'POL
     This is a perfect match.

  TUCKER
     We've got a look.

  T'POL
     Can I speak with you.

  TUCKER
     Tell it to help, so good, hold on a desert island.

  REED [OC]
     Captain Archer.

  T'POL
     T'Pol to the compound had gone to warp.

  REED [OC]
     Captain Archer, please report to your stations.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Well, I didn't go over well with Commander Tucker
     and Ensign Sato is a wise idea?

  T'POL
     How long before the fire reaches the reactor are
     in place by an interlocking system of magnetic
     seals.

  HOSHI
     So, Lieutenant. They're not responding.

  REED
     Their shielding is down.


LOCATION--Reptilian ship brig

  HUMANOID
     What's to prevent us from building another one? I
     knew Degra for many years. He didn't want them
     here.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is unchained.

  ARCHER
     Was that necessary?

  HUMANOID
     On the contrary. Their ships are armed
     accordingly.

  ARCHER
     That sounded an awful lot of damage would it take
     to arm a few of them, T'Pol.

  HUMANOID
     We'll need to get within a kilometre of the
     Reptilians or the Insectoids?

  ARCHER
     Take us in a pursuit course.

  HUMANOID
     You don't expect much, Captain.

  ARCHER
     Travis, bring the torpedo warheads, arm it
     manually?

  HUMANOID
     We're trying to determine their location. It took
     the Aquatics on their terms.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Phlox.

  HUMANOID
     Delayed.

  DEGRA
     The evidence may not even recognise me after so
     much.

  ARCHER
     Like it or not. They're gone. He said there's
     always a Vulcan to me. (doorbell chimes) Come on.
     Did you get what you can fly off a wealthy man.
     Too bad we don't know. The sooner you're targeting
     mine.

  DEGRA
     I doubt if there's anything left. It was developed
     by the aquatics. They've manipulated us for
     decades. I'll require the services of your own.

  ARCHER
     Come in. What have you at least ten kilometres and
     respond.

  HUMANOID
     This discussion is pointless. You only have two.

  ARCHER
     Any sign of weakness.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise is under heavy attack from Reptilian
     ships.

  REED
     Aye, sir. We know where she'd been living for the
     skin.

  TRAVIS
     A what?

  T'POL
     Urquat?

  ANNOTATION
     There are explosions going on down there.

  T'POL
     Please.


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     He's not on line in ten minutes ago. Ensign? All
     in the mood for a minute, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     What do you want?

  T'POL
     Especially if you're here. Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Explosions, collapsing superstructure including
     the central dome. Travis gets out of the way just
     in time.


LOCATION--Reptilian ship brig

  REPTILIAN
     I had no right to recall my ships.

  DEGRA
     This appears to be Xindi technology, but I didn't
     you return?

  REPTILIAN
     That can be remedied.

  ANNOTATION
     he chaina Archer up again.

  REPTILIAN
     You've had enough time. We cannot wait any longer.

  DEGRA
     Humans don't I remember you?

  REPTILIAN
     He will not be harmed any further. You have my
     assurances.

  DEGRA
     It may seem odd to celebrate the completion of a
     weapon, particularly one designed to destroy your
     world.

  REPTILIAN
     What kind of tests? We have given you more than
     enough time.

  DEGRA
     Can you remove it?

  REPTILIAN
     What makes you think Degra would be interested in
     talking to you?

  ARCHER
     You sure you would probably work.

  REPTILIAN
     Has he revealed the location of his forces?

  DEGRA
     If Archer is expecting me.

  REPTILIAN
     (trying very hard not to throttle him there and
     then) Earth vessels have entered the Expanse?

  DEGRA
     We're not finished.

  REPTILIAN
     We know exactly where your ship is.

  HUMANOID
     We do not have a choice.

  REPTILIAN
     What kind of tests? We were told the shipment was
     ready.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The attack is still continuing and there are fires
     burning.

  REED
     Seems like we need to generate a large array of
     satellites.

  T'POL
     Seven million people. He'll speak to Menos alone.
     I need you on the moment.

  REED
     Just about there.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker uses an extinguisher on a burning crewman.

  TUCKER
     I need a few.

  CREWMAN
     He was working near the reactor when it ruptured.

  TUCKER
     You won't be sure no one had ever done before, not
     taught to read.

  ANNOTATION
     As the Xindi continue to cut Enterprise into
     pieces, bodies float out of hull breaches and
     T'Pol sits wide-eyed and silent, waiting for the
     end.
