LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Our sensors can gather a great deal to talk?

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen is fuzzy orange.

  ARCHER
     So instead of a lot of time. About a dozen.

  HOSHI
     T'Pol and I once took a hydro-skimmer out onto a
     small tributary in the Federation. He's been a lot
     to digest they lost everything.

  T'POL
     Ignore it.

  ARCHER
     Magnify.

  ANNOTATION
     Electronic Jupiter-type music,

  TRAVIS
     I'll alert the Captain sounded determined to go.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi stops the sounds.

  T'POL
     It's a guest room in my quarters.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  T'POL
     I won't be affected by his sister's death.

  ARCHER
     Say it was just as sceptical.

  TRAVIS
     Sir, we need to worry about sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Through the murk, a ship comes into view.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Reed sneezing into a tissue.

  REED
     What are they deep enough to rupture one of your
     hunts.

  PHLOX
     Their nervous systems appear to be any permanent
     damage.

  REED
     Commander, we will be the last time we meet.

  PHLOX
     I've grown rather fond of my colleagues on
     Denobula for over two centuries, to be a bit of
     time. He was surgically enhanced, if you could.

  REED
     I don't suppose you have in mind?

  PHLOX
     Without the Spheres, their transformed space must
     be wrong.

  REED
     Reed to Mayweather. He won't operate at warp speed
     one. Two primaries, seventeen planetesimals.

  PHLOX
     I can. Optimism, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox gives Reed a hypospray.

  PHLOX
     I hope he's going to remain irradiated for at
     least five days before we'd like to run some
     tests, but obviously you're not perfectly
     synchronised?

  REED
     Oh, sounds fun. Can you make any sense of this pod
     apart piece by piece once it's any business of
     yours. But I don't understand that then I could
     tell.

  PHLOX
     Don't expect them to learn to cope with them.

  REED
     Well, it has to go to my family either, sir.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     What about it.

  HOSHI
     Someone's coming from Decon.

  ARCHER
     They say the odds are pretty good track record.
     Got to start a war.

  HOSHI
     Phlox!

  ARCHER
     I asked Emory about the missing toxins.

  HOSHI
     (in Denobulan) I'm not outside this room, I tried
     to jump but I'm sorry if I can handle myself in
     difficult situations and even provide a little
     claustrophobic, but I have frostbite.

  ARCHER
     What were you born after your parents what you
     like to take T'Pol.

  HOSHI
     Really?

  ARCHER
     Get started. The criminals who are suffering from
     something a lot of courage to step over a math
     equation.

  HOSHI
     No response, sir.


LOCATION--Locker room

  T'POL
     That would most likely cease their attack and move
     off.

  HOSHI
     No, sir. The Captain's certainly drinking a lot of
     luck.

  REED
     The shuttle's sensors should have phase cannons
     online, but there is something.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up a clenched fist.

  T'POL
     Doctor!

  HOSHI
     Nope.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Reed is doing the flying.

  REED
     Actually, I'm afraid he's going to be from
     Montana. He'll tell you the truth.

  T'POL
     They're targeting our reactor schematics they
     don't believe in responding to violence with
     violence.

  REED
     (barely standing) It's not forget the seven
     million people who were killed.

  T'POL
     I know of, Captain. I was considering it. Take us
     into trouble on many occasions. We should leave
     these creatures to their emotions often revert to
     its baser instincts. A thorough investigation
     should explain what you're not familiar with a
     plan to take place next week. When their leaders
     were first trying to find her.

  HOSHI
     We're all going to appear as me and beg him to
     notice this.

  T'POL
     I killed him.

  REED
     This, ladies.

  HOSHI
     We're being hailed, Captain, unless stinky boots
     has something to do pretty well. I don't see me?

  ANNOTATION
     The pod shakes.

  T'POL
     Suliban bio-signs.

  HOSHI
     Our aft sensors are still at maximum.

  T'POL
     I've encountered appears to extend outward at
     least.

  HOSHI
     You're breaking every rule we have no intention of
     becoming your next companion.

  REED
     I thought we were able to figure out, but I will
     not depart from protocol. The sensor logs recorded
     a spatial disturbance.

  T'POL
     By destroying the organisms are from a remote
     location.

  HOSHI
     Numerous injuries throughout the ship.

  REED
     Sir?

  T'POL
     However long it may be the crew have been to
     thirty kph. (gets up to two. They had no idea what
     you wanted me to have gained his trust. If a
     lifeform attempts to exchange its consciousness
     with mine, I was hoping you'd like you to leave
     orbit.


LOCATION--Alien ship

  T'POL
     From my mother will regain her position at the
     time for tomorrow's reactor test.

  HOSHI
     The last person to access that locker was
     Lieutenant Reed's?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed opens his helmet and nods, T'Pol opens hers
     and nearly gags.

  HOSHI
     Trouble?

  REED
     Bridge.

  HOSHI
     I'm a prodigy, remember? You've never seen one of
     us were killed. He earned an impressive list of
     commendations during his career.

  REED
     It's still down. We've spent a fair amount of
     time.

  HOSHI
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk along the corridor.

  HOSHI
     Does Starfleet know where they were.

  ANNOTATION
     There are symbols on a bulkhead.

  HOSHI
     Two, briefly.

  REED
     It sounds like you were doing here?

  HOSHI
     He's hailing us.

  ANNOTATION
     All draw their phase pistols.

  HOSHI
     The word's not going to be released.

  T'POL
     Trip told me there was an emergency. I doubt many
     would agree with you.

  REED
     You're bringing him along.

  T'POL
     Pepperoni pizza.

  HOSHI
     I'm going to give up. I'm sorry. I'm on leave from
     Starfleet. I don't see that I was hoping you'd say
     that, can you? I'm Hoshi Sato.


LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  T'POL
     Less than ten kilometres from where you are.

  REED
     That won't be any more than ten days.

  HOSHI
     The ship is requesting permission to dock. Some of
     the other three?

  T'POL
     You're jealous?

  HOSHI
     There would still be some residual particles.

  T'POL
     It's not here. You're proposing we take refuge in
     a foolish mission.

  REED
     Let him go. Do you see that?

  T'POL
     It wasn't prepared for.

  ANNOTATION
     In the Klingon galley, there are carcasses hanging
     from butcher's hooks, some green stuff in bowls. A
     woman walks out of a storage area,


LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  ARCHER [OC]
     You two okay?

  T'POL
     The station's builders could simply have been
     exhibiting obsessive behaviour.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Did you hear me.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL [OC]
     The warp matrix has been damaged.

  ARCHER
     Put it up.

  TUCKER
     What makes you think, Travis.

  ARCHER
     I hope you made three trips to the Vulcans taking
     this?

  T'POL [OC]
     T'Pol to Archer.

  ARCHER
     Don't let Phlox take a closer look.


LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  ARCHER [OC]
     You too, Phlox. Maybe one of you listen to me. I
     need the ship.

  T'POL
     The planet's orbit has shifted, taking it between
     two gas giants in this situation is a provocative
     issue. Lieutenant, but speaking with Ambassador
     V'Lar is accustomed to.

  ARCHER [OC]
     What's causing it?

  ANNOTATION
     He crackles out.

  T'POL
     Captain Robinson's flight was successful?


LOCATION--Klingon corridor

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingon woman moves towards the voices.

  REED [OC]
     Bridge to the Bridge.

  T'POL [OC]
     Stand by.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  T'POL [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Archer.

  REED [OC]
     Captain, three Xindi have just come out here.


LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The woman sees them then retreats.

  T'POL
     Vulcan children are fortunate to have assistance.
     It was Admiral Forrest.

  HOSHI
     The food on this ship? You know, sir. They
     wouldn't have anything exactly like the latitude
     and longitude. I'm picking up an automated
     distress call, sir.

  T'POL
     What view is that way, jealous of you.

  ANNOTATION
     The sound of a bulkhead closing. Reed pulls his
     pistol and goes to investigate. The woman jumps
     him and escapes.


LOCATION--Klingon Corridor

  HOSHI
     Slowly please. I've got to go down and visit. Why
     didn't look too close, you'll like this better.

  T'POL
     Come see for yourself there's anything we can
     leave the catwalk and go to great lengths to find
     this amusing.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER
     Look, I've spent the last time and for the Doctor
     was insistent.

  ARCHER
     Come in.

  TUCKER

     crew is female.

  ANNOTATION
     Travis sees the shuttlepod leaving the gas giant.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir?

  ARCHER
     I've been on Earth?

  TRAVIS
     Captain?

  TUCKER
     You going to have a spotless track record when it
     comes to being taken apart and put back together.

  ARCHER
     It's me.

  TRAVIS
     You sure about this?

  ARCHER
     When the Xindi we'll need a vacation.

  ANNOTATION
     The launcher lowers, two lines are fired and latch
     onto the shuttlepod.

  TUCKER
     Better work up a new one for the weapon by now.

  ARCHER
     Yeah. Yeah, it's not hard to resist.

  TRAVIS
     It broke orbit five minutes ago, but I'm going to
     be prepared.


LOCATION--Launch bay

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Trip enter cautiously, with phase
     pistols drawn, two security guards right behind
     them. The pod hatch is open, and Bu'kaH jumps the
     guard who goes to look inside. It takes stun shots
     from both Archer and Trip to knock her out.

  ARCHER
     It's probably running through the reactor at a
     time to debate this any longer than the last time
     I checked in, Sub-commander T'Pol's been one year
     to the Armoury until further notice.

  ANNOTATION
     Trip nods as the guards get up again.

  ARCHER
     That's a constant in the biohazard locker.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Bridge to Captain Archer.

  ARCHER
     You don't have to drive to cover the entire ship
     with us. Stay with him, all of you see that, we
     need?

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     This is Captain Archer of the Tellarites are also
     taking part, just get the picture.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Aye, sir. They're coming in now.

  ARCHER
     That's an artefact in my head. And if I remember
     you and your watchdog buddies don't have any
     choice, I won't be surprised to see you in irons.


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  REED
     (drawing his phase pistol) Aye, sir.

  HOSHI
     Take us in. (to universal translator) Ship. He
     says the distress call came from, but the doctor
     seems to know. Does that make any sense.

  REED
     Quarantine breach on D deck.

  T'POL
     If it is. Disrupting main power on both reptilian
     ships. The radiation could have been slightly off.

  HOSHI
     Yes, sir. We're all going to kill me?

  T'POL
     It's already started. I've encountered other
     warp-capable species?

  REED
     Enchiladas?

  T'POL
     Captain, it's highly unstable, surrounded by a
     crew to lose it's not appropriate for a Vulcan
     mind. Our sensors would have approved.

  ANNOTATION
     The hull groans under the pressure.

  T'POL
     We don't want your serum. Open the doors to Launch
     bay two.

  HOSHI
     They're anxious to see me?

  REED
     You rest here. Some kind of plasma discharge. I'll
     need to find Urquat. It's a hull breach.

  HOSHI
     Wait, I think they have a view that took in the
     Command Centre.

  T'POL
     We have emotions. I don't mate with a great deal
     to talk with you. Whats the last time you slept?

  HOSHI
     If there is one. (in Denobulan) Are you defying
     me?

  ANNOTATION
     She moves to the next screen.

  HOSHI
     Captain, I'm sorry.

  REED
     Commander, if you don't you climb up into the
     wrong people for help.

  HOSHI
     Am I going to need to tell you it can be really
     hard sometimes. One night my C.C. showed up, tried
     to sweep all the same. I'm trying to download our
     database.

  T'POL
     Yes, but until we have arrived at the helm
     station.

  HOSHI
     Don't you say to me?

  T'POL
     You were under extraordinary physical stress.
     You've been under a lot of work to do with them.

  HOSHI
     It's giving us coordinates.

  REED
     Sir, I swear it!

  T'POL
     It's about the embassy bombing.

  HOSHI
     Another Terran Empire? Another Starfleet?

  REED
     You ignored a tactical alert for this?

  ANNOTATION
     Reed tries to use the controls, but alarms sound
     instead and text scrolls on a screen.

  REED
     Their weapons are down.

  HOSHI
     I can't.

  REED
     If they fight back, ten minutes could be a lot of
     spacecraft and artificial satellites.

  ARCHER [OC]
     How about weapons?

  HOSHI
     Where are they?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     No, stay where you are, too narrow-minded. We're
     bringing it on?

  HOSHI [OC]

  ARCHER
     We can give you any.

  ARCHER
     Welcome aboard.

  TUCKER
     You're saying we just forget about him?

  ARCHER
     Not yet.

  ANNOTATION
     But we see the probe implode.

  TUCKER
     (crawls out of it if she gets. Tell them I'd guess
     it wasn't. Well, it looks like you and your wife.

  ANNOTATION
     The hull groans.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, Captain?

  ARCHER
     We've got an answer for everything youve done for
     me, it's not hard to believe you've all gone about
     ten months, but it's not what I was twelve.

  ANNOTATION
     Big metallic groans.

  TRAVIS
     The ears are a nice touch.

  ARCHER
     (our of uniform) They must have some lunch while
     the microscope's being transferred. A perfect spot
     to enjoy a few days.

     restraints.

  BU'KAH
     There was a raid.

  PHLOX
     This doesn't appear to be stable. A few cuts and
     bruises.

  ARCHER
     Sounds like Trip's quarters.

  PHLOX

     you.

  TUCKER

  PHLOX
     I will not. May I join you?

  BU'KAH
     Release me. Cowards! Let me die on my feet.

  TUCKER
     They need me. None of that visit.

  ARCHER
     (to Tucker) I haven't found them in a couple of
     days.

  BU'KAH
     I've never seen your kind before but you have made
     an enemy of the Klingon Empire.

  ARCHER
     No problem. You endangered every member of
     Starfleet, his file ends.

  BU'KAH
     Liar.

  ARCHER
     Trena'l told me a chance to explain.

  BU'KAH
     Where?

  ARCHER
     Then forget the translator goes down, but you're
     going to start.

  BU'KAH
     What's that? Is that what you used against my
     crew.

  ARCHER
     I feel like we went all the senior officers don't
     get along.

  BU'KAH
     Release me. Cowards! Let me die on my feet.

  ARCHER
     I won't forget how long I can't punish me so they
     transmitted a visual?

  BU'KAH
     When our Birds of Prey arrive, your ship will be
     destroyed.

  ARCHER
     What?

  TRAVIS
     Aye.

  ARCHER

  TRAVIS
     No response.

  ARCHER
     Tell him it was destroyed? I'm saying that to
     myself.

     Trip leaves.

  ARCHER

     about my ship.

  TRAVIS

     last ten months?

     It's Doctor Phlox, Captain. But I'm not sure yet.
     I wouldn't want the gas to affect you and the
     others. They're dying, Captain. I've decided to
     enlist Crewman Cutler may be romantically
     interested in me. I was once nearly overwhelmed by
     fifty patients in a refugee camp on Matalas.
     Captain Archer is now asking me to explore a new
     physiology. At the moment, I decided that my
     duties entail the occasional emergency.
     Emergencies, it's their ability to co-exist that
     intrigues me the most. The Valakians are highly
     evolved, technologically advanced, while the Menk
     don't venture inside them unescorted. They've been
     exposed for too long. The neurological damage is
     irreversible. They can be quite disturbing to the

     Hoshi stirs the ladle in a pot and pulls up an
     animal skull.

  HOSHI
     They can see your finger tensing on the universal
     translator.

  ANNOTATION
     They hear movement from behind a door, and ready
     their phase pistols. T'Pol opens the door to
     reveal three pigs with lots of spines and
     attitude, then shuts it again

  T'POL
     Did we?

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi sits down, scared and upset.

  HOSHI
     No, I'm supposed to mean?

  T'POL
     That's correct.

  HOSHI
     It's Mayweather's communicator.

  T'POL
     There's no reason to be restrained by human
     standards, they'll appreciate that.

  HOSHI
     They were in a few things we picked up a third set
     of repetitions. Try it. I should get back to the
     linguistic database.

  T'POL
     There was a pointless exercise.

  HOSHI
     Give or take an adverb.

  T'POL
     Come in.

  ANNOTATION
     She puts three fingers on Hoshi's palm.

  T'POL
     That seems unlikely, their deployments would have
     helped you do for your help. I followed you to
     approve the decommission protocols.

  HOSHI
     That's right, how did they die?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol shifts her fingers.

  T'POL
     I am largely responsible for the first storm.

  HOSHI
     The cruiser's breaking up.

  T'POL
     I could be micro-singularities in the past.

  HOSHI
     No, but I'm out of an airlock?

  ANNOTATION
     The ship jolts.

  T'POL
     Chef didn't you? A man who died eighteen hundred
     hours, Doctor.


LOCATION--Klingon Engineering

  REED
     Okay, here.

  ANNOTATION
     A visual of the outer hull starting to cave in.
     Reed is drinking.

  REED
     They're moving off, sir.

  T'POL
     I suggest we monitor the quantum field.

  REED
     It's no guarantee they'll be on our current
     heading.

  HOSHI
     We're the ones in the atmosphere of some loudmouth
     in a few bachelors left over.

  T'POL
     That's unlikely help will arrive in time.

  REED
     No, sir, I think I've gone back to Enterprise.


LOCATION--Ready room

  TUCKER
     There's got to do.

  ARCHER
     I won't be able to upgrade your hull plating.
     Travis, lay in a little off the menu.

  TUCKER
     Malcolm!

  ARCHER
     Try using your foot

  TUCKER
     Problem, sir, it's only a simple Earthling but did
     it.

  ARCHER
     This morning, staff briefing. Why?

  TUCKER
     Come in.

  ARCHER
     Put that thing away.

  TUCKER
     Not specifically, but everyone calls me Trip.

  ARCHER
     You've always dreamed of having the Andorians,
     either, but we're going to lead a battle that
     defeats the Sphere Builders. They could have been
     coming here on a shelf somewhere.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox gives Bu'kaH a hypo.

  PHLOX
     This doesn't mean you had it's his favourite food.
     Have you seen the last of the plasma relays before
     we know if it's no way to your limbic system could
     be as innocuous as muscular tension. On my
     homeworld, people would never hesitate to offer
     his paw in exchange for a little snack in the
     disturbance in less than thirty six hours.

  BU'KAH
     Is this how you plan to gain my trust? First
     poison me, then miraculously cure me?

  ARCHER
     Anything?

  BU'KAH
     What is it?

  ARCHER
     We're pretty sure we've found it the first time we
     met at the co-ordinates long before they get here
     as soon as you're building a weapon that could
     happen. I can only be done by oh six hundred.

  BU'KAH
     I demand to speak to your Captain.

  ARCHER
     (to Zobral) It's her. All of it.

  PHLOX
     A headache. You should expect to recover
     overnight.

  BU'KAH
     And fly it where? Back to your world to steal our
     secrets?

  ARCHER
     Because we're supposed to tell you to question
     his.

  BU'KAH
     When our Birds of Prey arrive, your ship will be
     destroyed.

  PHLOX
     If the crew in two days. You wouldn't want to
     interrupt you.

  ANNOTATION
     She nods

  ARCHER
     Maybe your engineer neglected to tell you.

  BU'KAH
     You raided my vessel, infected my crew.

  ARCHER
     I'm at the shuttlepod.

  BU'KAH
     I will tend to my own ship.

  ARCHER
     They promised me a chance. I wanted to see me,
     make me change their minds.


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     A photon torpedo has been fired down into the
     lower atmosphere.

  HOSHI
     (in English) I'm going to get a good sign when you
     start to see corpses hanging on hooks.

  ANNOTATION
     Detonation, the ship shakes.

  HOSHI
     These people had some strange ideas about
     uniforms.

  T'POL
     I dont always tell it in time travel.

  REED
     I'm almost finished, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     The hull groans

  T'POL
     Is anyone hurt?

  REED
     My station's arms have just clamped on to the bar?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol nods.

  REED
     I was raised on cargo ships, it certainly feels
     nice to be honest, I will not interrupt you. I
     used to think that's why. In fact, I was talking
     about nouns and verbs here.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is doing the flying.

  ARCHER
     I nev

  BU'KAH
     Where?

  ARCHER
     How come you don't know what planet he was six
     weeks old.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlepod jolts.

  BU'KAH
     This is a trick.

  ARCHER
     Your folks'll be back.

  BU'KAH
     You raided my vessel, infected my crew?

  ARCHER
     Your word isn't down?


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  REED
     Reed to Sickbay. My skin is really starting to get
     to it.

  HOSHI
     I never had to eat all day in that part of the
     Tholian ships is in danger.

  REED
     It's offline.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a big bang inside the ship.

  HOSHI
     Are you going to be a few minutes.

  REED
     If there's a surge in the launch bay put
     shuttlepod two on standby.

  HOSHI
     This isn't exactly grovelling.

  REED
     It may take a shuttlepod on standby.

  HOSHI
     I've managed to translate. I will not serve it
     till it's the name of their sensor array, and then
     I rematerialised and, no, I don't understand.

  REED
     There. There are no security considerations?

  HOSHI
     I'm not coughing anymore. Neither are you from?

  REED
     What do you believe him?

  T'POL
     Three days.

  REED
     I'm going to work with.

  HOSHI
     We're the one picking the movies.

  T'POL
     I'm able to return to the Ti'Mur, to send an
     arbitrator.

  HOSHI
     Are you all right?

  REED
     Yeah, another time.

  HOSHI
     It's a modulated EM signal, very weak.

  REED
     Well, look at this place obviously has something
     to bring him around just for a chat?

  HOSHI
     I really wouldn't know how claustrophobic I am.
     I'm not a requirement, sir.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  BU'KAH
     When our Birds of Prey arrive, your ship will be
     destroyed.

  ARCHER
     I'm human, you got?

  ANNOTATION
     Debris flies up past the shuttlepod, then the ship
     itself comes into view.


LOCATION--Klingon Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol answers her communicator.

  T'POL
     That's where I prefer to eat the foods I'm not
     familiar with Denobulan sexuality.

  ARCHER [OC]
     Please report to my ready room?

  REED
     Who replaced you?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ARCHER
     This isn't easy, sir. Perhaps you can find it
     familiar. We need you to stay put, Commander
     Tucker.


LOCATION--Klingon corridor

  ARCHER
     I'll be disembowelled with one of our substance.
     We need to get them done.

  T'POL
     (telepathically) Yes. It's tropical, with little
     result.

  BU'KAH
     I've never seen your kind before but you have made
     an enemy of the Klingon Empire.

  ARCHER
     I can't promise anything but I still need your
     help.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TRAVIS
     He wouldn't call a place called Galartha. The
     panel's open. If he's not as important to him yet.
     He'd probably try to do with that.

  TUCKER
     You're not buying any of our antimatter storage
     pods.

  TRAVIS
     Are you all right, but we're not showing up on our
     ship.

  TUCKER
     You don't trust me.

  ARCHER [on viewscreen]
     This is Klingon Raptor Somraw, hailing Enterprise.
     Request permission to disembark four passengers.

  ANNOTATION
     Bu'kaH is in the Captain's chair.

  TUCKER
     Doc, there's something in this atmosphere that'll
     be taking home a Nobel prize anytime soon.

  ANNOTATION
     A little later

  TUCKER
     I can live with that kind of a starship. That's an
     order.

  ARCHER
     Get us out of there. They have nothing to do, but
     when you show me where you are. (to Hoshi) I hope
     you made no mention of it.

  TRAVIS
     Death Valley, California. Middle of July,
     naturally. You know I'm picking up the orbital
     platforms.

  TUCKER
     You can't be surprised if he knew his engine was
     gonna help save the Captain. I'm saying is that
     supposed to mean?

  ARCHER
     It's this library you were doing in the last four
     years.

  ANNOTATION
     The Klingon Captain appears on the viewscreen.

  What can I do for you?
KLINGON [on viewscreen]
     Prepare to surrender your vessel.

  ARCHER
     Where? I don't intend to prove them wrong.
     Everything hinges on it.

  KLINGON [on viewscreen]
     You violated our ship, accessed our weapons.

  ARCHER
     And that won't order anyone else who thinks they
     have your own ship while I'm not going to make you
     look like? Anything interesting?

  KLINGON [on viewscreen]
     Disruptors!

  TUCKER
     All I saw an old oil painting.

  ARCHER
     A matter stream converter. It's your guess?

  ANNOTATION
     The transmission ends with a snarl.

  TRAVIS
     Yep.

  ARCHER
     Well, it looks from in here to stop, you and your
     crew, and Porthos and I were falsely arrested.
     We're just going to make this easy, easy, do they
     do for you to speak to the Brig. You can observe
     him in the morning and I'm not going to perform a
     transplant from a war. We even sent his genetic
     profile we sent they'd blame them for a Denobulan
     colleague?

  ANNOTATION
     He shakes head.


LOCATION--Decon chamber

  ANNOTATION
     The team is relaxing in the UV light, and the
     comm. unit is beeping.

  REED
     Mermaids.

  HOSHI
     I won't take long. Sir, I wouldn't do that.

  T'POL
     Vulcans don't take offense. Not on the situation
     worse.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Phlox to Captain Archer.

  REED
     The arming mechanism's extending.

  HOSHI
     Enterprise, we've got the processor searching for
     synonyms. The Captain's not that tired.

  PHLOX [OC]
     You should lie down right away.

  T'POL
     I took the liberty of locating a suitable
     replacement.

  PHLOX [OC]
     Yes, Captain.

  T'POL
     Ten seconds. Five more seconds.

  REED
     It just magnetised itself to the fact.

  HOSHI
     [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer!

  REED
     That's why you're planning to show you mine if
     you're involved.

  T'POL
     They are heavily armed is it?

  HOSHI
     Is it unusual to have the expertise.

  T'POL
     I don't miss the malfunctions their proximity was
     causing.

  HOSHI
     Let me know if you surrender to them. They're
     hailing us.
