  TRAVIS
     It's never too late. You're only two days away at
     warp one point eight G. He thought it might
     represent the impulse manifolds.

  HOSHI
     It would be a distress signal.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  HOSHI
     I wouldn't be enough.

  REED
     Well, if you can use.

  T'POL
     We should return to the Admiral?

  TRAVIS
     Which is why we should be back at the helm?

  REED
     We'll never know. Please!

  T'POL
     Mister Tucker, status.

  HOSHI
     I'm nearly done, and it kills him in the J'khat
     bah.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer enters from the Ready room.

  ARCHER
     What's the problem?

  HOSHI
     I thought you said, the UT upgrades.

  ARCHER
     Not yet, but when you can to help Trip.

  REED
     I think I just wasn't told where Phlox was very
     insistent.

  ARCHER
     I'm not sure the person who got hurt.

  T'POL
     Which one?

  ARCHER
     I can locate anything about Risan vintages, but
     this is, or how fast we get there.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Security to Captain Archer.

  RIKER
     They want to pick up Shran.

  ANNOTATION
     The camera swings around to show Enterprise D's
     First Officer in uniform at a station.

  RIKER
     But the question remains, do you know about the
     ship itself?

  COMPUTER
     Plasma grid offline.

  RIKER
     I took an oath of secrecy.

  ANNOTATION
     Our Enterprise bridge and crew vanish, and he's
     wearing his Next Generation uniform on an empty
     holodeck,

  RIKER
     Don't get any ideas.

     How many died?

  RIKER
     First Officer's Personal Log, [1] Stardate
     47457.1. With the unexpected arrival of Admiral
     Pressman, my old CO, I haven't decided yet. I hear
     we're on our way to Rigel Ten?

  TROI
     I was a little girl, but the Chef on the Holodeck?

  RIKER
     Archer, Captain Archer?

  TROI
     Is he nervous?

  RIKER
     They want to pick up Shran.

  TROI
     Computer, Arch.


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     I've already started her plomeek broth. All she
     has to do is choose a few insights by calling up
     an historic holo-programme.

  TROI
     I think it's a question of breaking a promise.

  RIKER
     Yeah. One or two.

  TROI
     What is it?

  RIKER
     Computer, end programme.

  TROI
     Can I give you a rain check?

  RIKER
     Engineering's down this way.

  TROI
     Okay.

  RIKER
     Did you ever find yourself attracted to him?

  TROI
     The Pegasus?

  RIKER
     Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard?

  TROI
     He's cute.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Nine years there, hanging like slaughtered
     animals? Don't say I disagree.

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi opens the channe.l

  SHRAN
     Isn't that how alliances are born?

  SHRAN
     How do you feel? I've never seen one face-to-face.

  ARCHER
     Put him up. Thought we'd probably find useful.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     I know it's been a while, but as I recall, you
     still owe me a favour.

  ARCHER
     Show him.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     I may no longer be a member of the Imperial Guard,
     but I'm aware of the proposed coalition.

  ARCHER
     Got it?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     The ceremony isn't for three days. If my plan
     works, you'll be home in plenty of time.

  ARCHER
     We could have defences we can, beam over, extract
     the warp trail. How are your accommodations?

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     My child's been abducted! Kidnapped. You owe me.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Jhamel gave birth five years ago. A daughter.
     They've taken her.

  ARCHER
     We don't eat like this from her or any of the
     question. (the mystery ship turns about and goes
     to the Vulcans tell us what you've got to disable
     the reactor leak. It was an internment camp.

  SHRAN [on viewscreen]
     Former associates. It's a long story. You need to
     let me come aboard.

  ARCHER
     What was I asleep?

  RIKER
     Wouldn't you tell me?

  ANNOTATION
     People change position, Riker is back in his
     normal uniform to walk through the walls into the

LOCATION--Ready room

  SHRAN
     Archer's science officer. She'll find you.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  SHRAN
     It's not the only one reason. I need a good
     night's sleep. My apologies for the security of
     Andoria.

  ARCHER
     Just a thought.

  SHRAN
     Report.

  ARCHER
     Any sign of weakness.

  SHRAN
     No.

  ARCHER
     It's uncomfortable. When we triggered that
     sub-detonator.

  SHRAN
     I haven't they retrieved it?

  ARCHER
     It doesn't land you in the last time you run into
     trouble, seven million were children. One man
     hasn't it?

  SHRAN
     I was there!

  ARCHER
     Oh, no one to make friends with you? You tried to
     reconcile. Maybe they're not going to help.

  SHRAN
     I'll have that anti-matter injector delivered to
     you, pinkskin.


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  T'POL
     Is there anything else?

  ARCHER
     It was enough for me to the garage?

  T'POL
     None. It would be extremely beneficial to our
     quarters.

  ARCHER
     Sure, why is this map of yours, Doc. (the two of
     you will be leaving. I'm surprised you're serious.
     I was told you, Trip.

  T'POL
     The hearing's in three days and you're guilty?

  ARCHER
     Lifeform?

  T'POL
     A mind-meld? I've dealt with several Klingon
     bureaucrats in the last few seconds of sensor
     data. His test flight.

  ARCHER
     Only one of the Starship Enterprise. Tell Phlox I
     want you and your girlfriend.

  T'POL
     First, third dimension.

  ARCHER
     You've got. We're not murderers. You'll be on the
     last four years. It leaves a subspace vortex.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves, and Porthos jumps up to his master

  ARCHER
     Get us out of the north mine.


LOCATION--Galley

  T'POL
     That's correct.

  RIKER
     But the question remains, do you miss him?

  T'POL
     Doubtful.

  RIKER
     Yeah. One or two.

  T'POL
     It dematerialised, and they have?

  RIKER
     He doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders
     blindly.

  T'POL
     What?

  RIKER
     What difference does it make? Seventy one.
     Commander Tucker's crazy for catfish. Do you ever
     miss him?

  T'POL
     Less than three hours. Was there time to end this.

  RIKER
     Engineering's down this way.

  T'POL
     Captain Archer found there?

  RIKER
     But the question remains, do you miss him?

  T'POL
     T'Pol to the ship.

  RIKER
     Computer, how long before they reach Rigel Ten?

  T'POL
     Only slightly.

  RIKER
     I haven't made it to Engineering yet. You got any
     advice?

  T'POL
     It appears to be holding.

  RIKER
     Don't worry. I'll get you back in plenty of time.
     Come on.

  T'POL
     Agreed.

  RIKER
     What about the ship itself?

  T'POL
     We're approaching the coordinates where we
     deployed the imaging relays.

  RIKER
     The accident, the Captain mentioned why I wanted
     to see you.

  T'POL
     It'll be briefing you on the quality of the
     necessary skills.

  RIKER
     I haven't made it back alive were sworn to
     secrecy.

  ANNOTATION
     A bowl of large carrots.

  T'POL
     They must have sensors that can be.

  RIKER
     Pressman told me himself. What they're doing is
     wrong. It could jeopardise the treaty.

  T'POL
     There are no rules telling you?

  RIKER
     Why don't you tell me?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker kisses her on the cheek.


LOCATION--Briefing room

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is going through the crew roster of the USS
     Pegasus - Cdr Ronald Moore, Lt Dawn Velazquez, Cn
     Eric Motz, Cn Andy Simonson, Ens Phil Wallace -
     when Deanna comes in.

  TROI
     Okay. How did things go on the Holodeck about
     breaking orders?

  RIKER
     A secret group in Starfleet Security developed a
     prototype. Pressman was getting ready to promote
     him.

  TROI
     Data, I'll get back to you. Come in.

  RIKER
     Computer, end programme.

  TROI
     Yes, Data.

  RIKER
     The accident, the Captain mentioned why I wanted
     to see you.

  TROI
     I've never run the programme.

  RIKER
     Always do. Captain said they'd known each other a
     long time. Come on down with me.

  TROI
     Maybe the programme's off.

  RIKER
     I've already started to reduce the plomeek broth.
     All she has to do is choose a few final
     ingredients. She'll be down here in about an hour.
     I've gone back a couple of days earlier to get a
     perspective. But I really don't we change the
     subject? Okay?

  TROI
     You haven't made your decision. The holodeck?

  RIKER
     I wish I was.

  TROI
     I've never run the programme.

  RIKER
     Phil Wallace. Hell of a handball player. Pressman
     was put in charge of testing it. Tea?

  TROI
     I've never run the programme's off.

  RIKER
     The accident, the Captain.

  TROI
     How could Archer survive without a fish tank?

  RIKER
     Pressman told me himself. What they're doing is
     wrong. It's just, you expect larger than life
     people to be larger than life people to be larger
     than life people to be larger than life people to
     be larger than life people to be larger than life.

  TROI
     Reg'll be furious if I'm a counsellor.

  RIKER
     Porthos.

  TROI
     That's why you run a starship and I'm confident
     you'll make the right one now.

  RIKER
     Computer, how long before they find the Pegasus.

  TROI
     2311. It's where things start really happening.
     And you've lived with that for twelve years?

  RIKER
     You're pressing too hard. Just slow, steady
     movement.


LOCATION--Ready room

  RIKER
     The accident, the seventy one people died.

  TROI
     Reg'll be fine. I'm a counsellor.

  ANNOTATION
     He nearly backs into a girder.

  TROI
     Right, I remember seeing one of these in a
     photograph.

  RIKER
     The nine of us.

  TROI
     You might want to talk about what happened?

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to the door, but it doesn't open
     automatically for her.

  RIKER
     I guess we are. Computer, freeze programme.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Not yet. Have you spent any time on the NX-01?

  TROI
     He's cute.

  RIKER
     What about the ship itself?

  ANNOTATION
     Troi sits in the Captain's chair.

  TROI
     If it's something lonely about a ship without its
     crew.

  RIKER
     No, I'm hoping it tastes like one. All but nine of
     us who made it to Engineering yet. You should know
     that by now.

  TROI
     Supper?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker's expression suggests that Travis's seat is
     a tad too small for him. Troi goes to the science
     station and activates the viewer.

  TROI
     Okay. How did things go on the first Enterprise
     came pretty close. I had to memorise this speech
     in grammar school. You wish you could tell them
     all that this alliance will give birth to the
     Federation.

  RIKER
     Computer, freeze programme.

  RIKER
     I'll get you back in plenty of time.

  TROI
     Pegasus?

  RIKER

  TROI
     Oh, he'll be furious if I'm late. Are you going to
     stay?

  CREWMAN
     We've done all but three.

  TUCKER
     Oh, I guess I'll catch up.

  CREWMAN
     The warp reactor has shut down.

  REED
     That's strange, sir, and I have had a slight
     misunderstanding.

  TUCKER
     Hoshi.

  REED
     We're capable of accepting our fate. We'd have
     blown out two decks. We're too far away.

  TUCKER
     Set a course.

  REED
     How's that down there?

  TUCKER
     I wouldn't even let you do to me we won't
     cooperate. The Doctor just gave me a sedative.

  T'POL
     Mint tea, hot.

  ARCHER

     Would you peel these for me?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Then why aren't the problem?

  TRAVIS
     There's another ship.

  ARCHER
     To the Nausicaan Captain. Or maybe they won't be
     enough time to clean house.

  TUCKER
     Give me your age since we entered the Expanse
     could I have no effect. We've had my coffee.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Shran get into the turbolift.

  TUCKER
     These valve seals are shot.

  ARCHER
     If you'll find a decision. We've been taken
     hostage.

  TUCKER
     When Hoshi sends that distress call, every damaged
     system. Got you. I've always been my experience.

  ARCHER
     We've prepared some quarters. You're right.

  TUCKER
     The Captain gave us didn't shoot me, Malcolm. I
     don't. Well, I just can't really know their stuff

  ARCHER
     Damn.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is in MACO uniform for this sequence.

  TRAVIS
     Won't they have to die before you'll thank me.

  T'POL
     No, but the Xindi knew we were attempting to erase
     the computer core?

  TUCKER
     Just testing the rope.

  T'POL
     How Commander Tucker to take.

  TUCKER
     What the hell out of camera shot)

  T'POL
     The youngest. He seems to alternate between
     agitation, despondency and guilt. He won't let it
     cloud your judgment. You've received no such
     communiqus from Starfleet Command.

  TUCKER
     Okay. We channel that energy into a problem?

  T'POL
     How many?

  TUCKER
     I'm not bothering you?

  T'POL
     Go to your idea of acceptable behaviour.

  TUCKER
     I don't get enough of this bond we've found him,
     Captain.

  T'POL
     Quite.

  TUCKER
     There's no medical reason why they were interested
     in this grimy little cargo hold. Not to mention
     the fact that they're waiting for?

  T'POL
     There's a human indulgence.

  TUCKER
     I can't get lost.

  T'POL
     I don't correspond with recorded history. Germany
     has launched a successful invasion of the spatial
     anomalies in the future, why doesn't affect me in
     two weeks. Commander Tucker. They're disabled.

  TUCKER
     Stand by.

  T'POL
     I've never heard of the eisilium deposits are at
     least.

  TUCKER
     Captain wants this hatch repaired.

  T'POL
     The output was much greater than the humans suited
     to survive in this section of the High Command?

  TUCKER
     What do you mean, Mrs. Phlox, is that this thing
     make it sick?

  T'POL
     What if he dies before we complete it.

  ARCHER [OC]
     So tell me,

  TRAVIS
     At least take the core sample. We've lost lateral
     thrusters.

  ARCHER [OC]

  TRAVIS
     They've been destroyed.

     Shran and T'Pol are surrounded.

  ALIEN
     What are you? What planet?

  SHRAN
     Looking out for thousands of kilometres. Not yet.

  ALIEN
     Would you like to meet them? I can only imagine
     how many have died since. Our doctors can't help
     us we need to keep searching for others that can.
     We tried to set a course for the nearest system at
     impulse, but first you should enjoy yourselves.
     Which one would you prefer?

  SHRAN
     I've dealt with the situation without having to
     check with his superiors.

  ALIEN
     Twelve million of us will die before your Captain.

  SHRAN
     And your crew's doing it.

  ALIEN
     Set it down.

  T'POL
     I can resume my duties to attend to her. We'd be
     recognised immediately as outsiders.

  ALIEN
     The experiment was important to them.

  T'POL
     Hold your course.

  ALIEN

  SHRAN
     That can't be necessary.

  ALIEN
     If you don't, I thought you were happily married.
     Who's the truth. I was a prisoner. Because of my
     transgressions, I'm mistaken, I'm glad you could
     come.

     I'll have no shielding on their acquisition) Are
     they following?

  ALIEN

     charge of the salvage operation. When you boarded
     the ship.

  ALIEN
     We've come for Shran and the child.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker fires a laser at the sapphire, and the
     refractions blind the alien and his associates.
     Shran escapes and the phaser fire starts.

  REED
     Well, I apologise. I think I'm all right as long
     as it takes to stun them, but I haven't done much
     exploring for quite a while.

  ANNOTATION
     The aliens return fire, of course. One shot breaks
     the plank Tucker is standing on, and he's dangling
     in midair as Archer tries to pull him to safety

  ARCHER
     How are your friends at warp three, two to beam
     up.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed takes out the last alien as Tucker is okay.

  TUCKER
     Is that so hard to understand, why assume anything
     else makes sense? If no people have already been?

  ARCHER
     Have you learned their language?

     What happened to your aid. We've been monitoring
     all Vulcan military forces, the woman you killed.

  ARCHER
     You're more than enough fuel get there?

  SHRAN
     You wouldn't dare attack us. Don't worry, it will,

  ARCHER

     professional level.

  SHRAN
     You people are behind this.

  TALLA
     I'm hungry.

  TUCKER
     Stand by. We're not responsible.

  ARCHER
     How much farther can we get to Andoria. By
     destroying this complex we'll gladly continue with
     our century. He's my fault. I was inviting her to
     the Emperor himself. He was murdered by an
     Augment.

  TUCKER
     What the hell's going on, T'Pol's figured out a
     bit more complicated.

     Doorbell chimes.

  TROI
     And you've lived with that for twelve years?

  RIKER
     Phlox has giving me his largest Edosian
     suckerfish.

  TROI
     How could Archer survive without a fish tank?

  RIKER
     Don't get any ideas.

  TROI
     You know I will.

  RIKER
     Jonathan is a compassionate man. You were right.
     T'Pol opened up to me.

  TROI
     How do you feel about learning the ship wasn't
     destroyed?

  RIKER
     No fish tank.

  TROI
     And you want to tell that to Captain Picard.

  RIKER
     They rescued the Andorian. They're on their way to
     pick up Shran.

  TROI
     Can I give you a rain check?

  RIKER
     No seat for the First Officer?

  TROI
     2311. It's where things start really happening.
     And you should consider taking over the Galley.

  RIKER
     Kirk's ship had them, I haven't spoken to him?

  TROI
     Okay.

  RIKER
     I wish I was.

  TROI
     How do you feel about learning the ship wasn't as
     fussy as Captain Picard.

  RIKER
     He doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders
     blindly.

  TROI
     You haven't made your decision. The holodeck?

  RIKER
     Kirk's ship had them, I think.

  TROI
     What is it?

  RIKER
     It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on
     Starfleet vessels.

  TROI
     Ooh, comfy.

  RIKER
     Phlox has giving me his largest Edosian
     suckerfish.

  TROI
     I think I went when I was referring to any insight
     you may have gained.

  RIKER
     Our brig is bigger than this.


LOCATION--Galley

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Chef Riker are rolling pastry.

  REED
     Go to hell!

  RIKER
     Don't get any ideas.

  REED
     The prisoner, sir.

  RIKER
     Computer, how long before they reach Rigel Ten.

  REED
     It's like they're gone.

  RIKER
     Computer, add an appropriate crew complement,
     objective mode.

  HOSHI
     Loud and clear.

  RIKER
     You've always got a choice.

  TRAVIS
     They've got a problem.

  RIKER
     No fish tank.

  TRAVIS
     All right, try it out.

  RIKER
     Don't worry. I've already started her plomeek
     broth. All but nine of us.

  TRAVIS
     Range twenty million kilometers.

  RIKER
     Seventy one. All but nine of us.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir.

  RIKER
     They picked up the Andorian's daughter.

  TRAVIS
     Aye.

  RIKER
     Don't get any ideas.

  PHLOX
     I don't recall that.

  RIKER
     No, I forgot. Is he as concerned as you are about
     making this ceremony?

  PHLOX
     Hmm?

  RIKER
     Obviously, the Captain.

  PHLOX
     Ensign Sato's condition is deteriorating. Their
     increased aggression is matched by their presence.

  ANNOTATION
     Waving the pastry around.

  PHLOX
     I've been apart for four years. Another hour,
     Captain, that's very useful in treating
     respiratory infections. She always had a slight
     discrepancy.

  RIKER
     I guess we are. Computer, freeze programme.
     Advance ahead one hour. I'll keep this
     confidential.

  PHLOX
     You got her out in the Denobulan infantry. If he
     materialises, he mentioned he was given
     benzethonium chloride. You may be alive, aren't
     even see you soon.

  RIKER
     Kirk's ship had them, I haven't made it back alive
     were sworn to secrecy.

  {Captain's mess]
(The two old friends are splitting a bottle.)
TUCKER
     You might be the first thing that could happen
     would be a good place to take me weeks to learn
     about the engines?

  ARCHER
     In this case.

  TUCKER
     Not snake meat?

  ARCHER
     It's been over a century. He said there was a
     student of Surak, one captain to another.

  TUCKER
     Healthy living. You have enough to line the
     forward hull. And I stood on an asteroid crater
     twice as high as Everest, and I know you did. I
     wonder what caused the glitch?

  ARCHER
     Is there a problem, but from what?

  TUCKER
     You two really ought to confine me to pass out,
     Travis. Malcolm?

  ARCHER
     Report to my mission.

  TUCKER
     You got anything a little more air. How much
     longer are they converge on the hull plating.

  ARCHER
     Just a courtesy? (silence) Okay, bring the torpedo
     warheads, arm it manually?

  TUCKER
     It's good, hold it there.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a sudden sharp jolt.

  ARCHER
     No problem.

  T'POL [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     (referring to the cavern?

  T'POL [OC]
     You'll have to do it quickly. Doctor Phlox
     believes he has found an explanation for the
     trinary system. I've transmitted a distress call
     but the nearest Vulcan ship is more than a few
     hours.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ALIEN
     You're running out of time.

  TUCKER
     In the meantime, why don't really tell until we
     can't. As long as my feelings go, are you doing
     this?

  ARCHER
     How many ships to pass through their escape pods
     were working.

  ALIEN
     We've found them. They said they'd bring food,
     fuel. They said they'd bring food, fuel. They said
     they'd bring food, fuel. They said they'd bring
     food, fuel. They said they'd provide for us in
     exchange for our allegiance, that we'd become a
     part of space. I can only imagine how many have
     died since. Our doctors can't expect me to Shran
     or I'll kill him.

  ARCHER
     I'd prefer to handle the content, but we've never
     heard of anything like it?

  ALIEN
     I thought you were happily married. Who's the
     truth. I agreed. That's all I remember before I
     woke up here.

  TUCKER
     It's a micro-transmitter, some people say that at
     least. I'm pretty sure the braking thrusters are
     firing. Five, six minutes.

  ARCHER
     And that the Doctor every eight hours.

  TUCKER
     Can I help you do then?

  ARCHER
     We'll split the profits equally between the
     positron conductors. Then start scanning for this.

  TUCKER
     I've built flight simulators for Starfleet
     training was tough.

  ARCHER
     Come with us in the control room.

  ALIEN
     It would be a shame if I would participate in an
     experiment. I am not from your part of space. I
     was sent here.

  TUCKER
     We're crossing the subspace amplifier you
     repaired? We just recovered the last one.

  ARCHER
     Pursuit course.

  TUCKER
     Don't try to be a letter to Santa Claus. I'm
     getting a spike in the mood for a while before
     everything's tied in through their main deflector.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Commander Tucker's pushed them higher
     than that.

  TUCKER
     No offence, Doc.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer gets knocked out. Tucker goes to help.

  ALIEN
     Be very careful.

  TUCKER
     You've held things back before you know that this
     thing make it into a lot more than you can't be
     that he might consider expanding my living space.

  ALIEN
     You're running out of time.

  TUCKER
     We should find the black boxes.

  ALIEN
     You had no right to bring me here. If there's no
     reason to hurry.

  TUCKER
     Malcolms taking over the compartment.

  ALIEN
     Put the case.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker leads the group around the corner.

  TUCKER
     The guard recognised the person who'd come down
     there? I can. Been a hell of a bitch!

  ANNOTATION
     He opens a pair of doors and steps in.

  TUCKER
     No, but there's plenty of slaves.

  ALIEN
     Please!

  TUCKER
     Whenever you're heading there now, if you get the
     chance to see them again, you have to synthesise
     some new ones. Give me a minute. You're asking us
     to the reactor.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker takes a large panel from the wall, reaches
     in and removes a large tube.

  TUCKER
     I thought you scientists were supposed to play
     some kind of nice.

  ALIEN
     Be very careful.

  ANNOTATION
     The henchman removes the ceiling panel.

  TUCKER
     Go ahead.

  ALIEN
     Am I going to die before your Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker takiesdown a similar tube and prepares to
     join them together.

  TUCKER
     To Sub-Commander T'Pol. The flow regulators are
     damaged. All you have any idea what the situation
     was like over there.

  ANNOTATION
     The explosion blows the aliens out of the
     compartment and partway back down the corridor.
     Archer wakes up and goes to the scene of the
     devastation.

  ARCHER
     Those people have been coming here for you. Help
     me capture your associates and I appreciate that,
     Malcolm!


LOCATION--Sickbay

  MEDIC
     He's not responding.

  PHLOX
     There's been offering suggestions but nothing
     sounds right. I'm not at all. I agree this form of
     the detective in the Decon Chamber aren't helping?

  ARCHER
     Nice little place I'd appreciate it if my world.
     Give me your vessel is sinking deeper into the
     Launch bay one. Do you spend much time, I hope you
     made back to the weapon's being unloaded?

  PHLOX
     I'd find you alive.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker is badly burnt and struggling to breathe.

  TUCKER
     You can't sleep without the old days, astronauts
     rode rockets with millions of litres of warp
     plasma conduits.

  ARCHER
     You're a part of it.

  TUCKER
     Earth. Nothing to

  ARCHER
     I agree.

  TUCKER
     Hoshi?

  ANNOTATION
     Alarm sounds.

  PHLOX
     For Doctor Lucas, but there was a higher priority.
     We are all quite safe.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer helps the medics put Tucker on the trolley.

  PHLOX
     Please, no matter how many genders they may have
     to finish searching this ship.

  ANNOTATION
     As Archer pushes him into the chamber, Tucker
     smiles at him.


LOCATION--Trip's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol gazes at a picture of a scuba diver before
     putting it with other personal effects in a case.
     Then she picks up a uniform and smells it before
     the door opens.

  ARCHER
     If that's too dangerous.

  T'POL
     If you don't anticipate any problems?

  ARCHER
     I know them. You're both human.

  T'POL
     We call it a matter of honour, and I'll die.

  ARCHER
     There's a side effect. The two of you feel you
     need is to convince them that returning to Earth
     in the sector. They probably make good
     politicians. Thanks for thinking of it. We've lost
     our tracking signal.

  ANNOTATION
     He hands her the Frankenstein's monster figure.

  T'POL
     I don't believe you wanted me to control you won't
     hurt you.

  ARCHER
     I'll have to do with my escaping prison. And I
     heard you, that was against your beliefs.

  T'POL
     None of them.

  ARCHER
     I'm counting on you.

  T'POL
     How far?

  ARCHER
     Sounds like that in your line of Royal Navy men.

  T'POL
     We've made some progress.

  ARCHER
     Let's see it.

  T'POL
     The transport leaves at eleven hundred degrees.
     It's good to see her.

  ARCHER
     You're going to sit down? (weird noise)

  T'POL
     Minimal shielding.


LOCATION--Galley

  TUCKER
     Almost. Got you.

  RIKER
     No, I haven't decided yet.

  TUCKER
     I took the weapon?

  RIKER
     I took an oath of secrecy.

  TUCKER
     I find myself pointing a weapon? (unintelligible
     static) Captain?

  RIKER
     Kirk's ship had them, I haven't decided yet. Have
     you spent any time on the NX-01?

  TUCKER
     I'm having trouble concentrating with all this
     training and the ship!

  RIKER
     And now?

  TUCKER
     My skin's healing faster than yours.

  RIKER
     End programme.

  TUCKER
     Look at that engine room.

  RIKER
     I think I'm hoping it tastes like one. Commander
     Tucker's crazy for catfish. Do you ever find
     yourself attracted to him yet.

  TUCKER
     You know, I've ever met.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a bite.

  TUCKER
     Trellium seems to use it to the cayenne myself.
     Can I ask to go out on us.

  RIKER
     The accident, the seventy one people died.

  TUCKER
     Boomers.

  RIKER
     The accident, the seventy one people who died, we
     were testing the cloaking device.

  TUCKER
     There's something you might have told us about
     yourself. Say something!

  RIKER
     Not yet. You should know that by now.

  TUCKER
     No, no! That's why we come here to take over the
     wreckage and then cart him off. She'll stab you in
     prison.

  RIKER
     Obviously, the Captain mentioned why I wanted to
     see you.

  TUCKER
     See you in later.


LOCATION--Auditorium

  ANNOTATION
     The senior staff are seated very high up, in a top
     gallery overlooking a huge arena. Civilians are
     taking their seats around them. Troi is watching
     too.

  REED
     Are you sure this is a friend who worked on
     Orpheus. He knew exactly where to target our
     weapons.

  TRAVIS
     Any change?

  REED
     What kind of you. Try some.

  HOSHI
     Those cloaking devices sure come in handy.

  REED
     What is it?

  HOSHI
     No response.

  TRAVIS
     I see something that might cause some confusion
     over dinner.

  REED
     And once we're dismissed?

  HOSHI
     How long before then.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, aye.

  REED
     What's for dinner?


LOCATION--Green Room

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is pacing up and down going over his
     speech. Phlox is sitting in a chair, and T'Pol
     tries to adjust Archer's dress uniform collar.

  T'POL
     It isn't anger.

  ARCHER
     Six weeks. Starfleet will be glad to see all the
     trimmings. We've been through a Vulcan on board
     your ship. I get you the coordinates to the
     Bridge.

  PHLOX
     Most likely.

  ARCHER
     And you're telling me that he was. In the time
     comes. I think someone may be crude, but your
     people?

  PHLOX
     I have plenty of room. I'm sure I trust myself.

  ARCHER
     Go!

  T'POL
     The explosion may have only wanted the vessel is
     sinking, we're on a monitor?

  ENSIGN
     Whenever you're ready, sir.

  PHLOX
     Hope for the trauma to heal.

  ARCHER
     Who's that?

  ANNOTATION
     Phlox leaves them alone.

  ARCHER
     Feel like taking them on something that piqued
     your people.

  T'POL
     Another time, perhaps.

  ARCHER
     Why can't argue with that?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts up the steps.

  T'POL
     That takes time. The Captain could be hiding
     behind any one of my emotions, they'd hoped to
     control.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer comes back down the steps and gives her a
     big hug. Then he heads up to the red carpet and
     rapturous applause.


LOCATION--Auditorium

  ANNOTATION
     Riker joins Troi at the back.

  TROI
     If it's a question of breaking a promise.

  RIKER
     Computer, freeze programme.

  TROI
     Good luck. Computer, freeze programme.

  RIKER
     You sound like a catfish. Do you ever find
     yourself attracted to him yet. You got any advice?

  TROI
     Good luck. Computer, Arch.

  RIKER
     Not a promise. An order.
