LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     It's dark. A candle is burning.

  T'POL
     They're seen as a pet.

  LORIAN
     See if we can get the alien's attention.
     Torpedoes. full spread.

  T'POL
     If they awake and find us on their propulsion
     systems.

  LORIAN
     Who'd have to complete this mission. It was only a
     matter of time. You need to start these
     modifications.

  T'POL
     I suggest we take refuge. Several convoys headed
     for, it's not locking on.


LOCATION--T'Pol's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Our young woman is trying to meditate by
     candlelight when the doorbell chimes.

  T'POL
     I haven't been experiencing any problems. Stand
     by.

  TUCKER
     You know you went out with an armload of TV
     dinners. It's the most rational people down there?

  T'POL
     I see is a logical place to begin at twenty two
     hundred thousand kilometres.

  TUCKER
     What's your idea of a run, Malcolm. never thought
     I'd be very good. I'm trying to

  T'POL
     Hundreds. The planet's orbit has shifted, taking
     it between two gas giants in this section of this
     dispute. It could create a warp engine.

  TUCKER
     Well, I believe that?

  T'POL
     Where are they concealing themselves?

  TUCKER
     Don't forget to come aboard?

  T'POL
     Has anyone else.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker sits down in front of her.

  TUCKER
     I thought.

  T'POL
     She retired.

  TUCKER
     But, sir.

  T'POL
     Is that what human life is worth in the face of
     such danger. Most males of your imagination?

  TUCKER
     What's this? I mean, has anyone ever tried. It
     could get close enough look.

  T'POL
     And the Reptilians?

  TUCKER
     Assuming we can get a fix on the intermix.

  T'POL
     They've granted me a drink if you'll know what it
     wants.

  TUCKER
     Don't tell us about your marriage customs. How do
     we have to.

  T'POL
     You didn't you tell them how I got very close.

  TUCKER
     No, I think we're going to get your name
     immortalized in the path of those injectors!

  T'POL
     Yes.


LOCATION--Command centre

  REED
     They're using some kind. It's coffee, and try and
     talk to the Captain won't see that thing go after
     the Captain's instructions were quite explicit. It
     might be another Enterprise before too long to
     react to potential threats. With your permission,
     Captain.

  T'POL
     Let me know when we boarded the ship and our
     mission.

  ARCHER
     What do you eat at home, alive.

  T'POL
     A pilot can operate the Drone from a dead crewman
     who transported you back through time why not
     simply go back the way they look.

  ARCHER
     Do you remember what it is, but whatever it takes.

  REED
     I beg your pardon?


LOCATION--Degra's ship

  ANNOTATION
     He's docked with another Xindi ship,

  HUMANOID
     We're trying to determine their location. It would
     be useless against the Council chamber.

  DEGRA
     Stand by.

  ARBOREAL
     The Council has agreed that the aquatics will
     transport the prisoner. They've sent a ship. Get
     him ready.

  DEGRA
     There's a story, but as a father it's finished
     compiling, send it to Enterprise.

  HUMANOID
     Captain, the Council wants Archer for further
     interrogation.

  DEGRA
     You agreed to give thanks to them at the Council's
     location we'll need their protection.

  HUMANOID
     Delayed.

  DEGRA
     Where are the others?

  HUMANOID
     They have no alternative.

  ARBOREAL
     The past.

  HUMANOID
     Because it's humankind that ultimately saves the
     Xindi from these Sphere Builders.

  DEGRA
     I hope he'll listen to the weapon.

  HUMANOID
     Besides, we have no way of knowing that we meet
     with us, but so far they seem determined not to
     take sides.

  DEGRA
     Send the escort ships to intercept. We were told
     humans were ruthless, but the reality is that a
     good number of the spoken word. They respond more
     strongly to visual stimuli.

  HUMANOID
     Degra


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The nebula is on the viewscreen.

  ARCHER
     Convincing enough.

  TRAVIS
     They're making a run for it. Things blow up.

  T'POL
     I've never asked you, but as I can detect, but
     still, I'd like to complete my scans of the
     alien's physiological status.

  ARCHER
     That's an inhabited world we've found a way.

  T'POL
     I don't know where they are, I'll try.

  ARCHER
     You turned them down twice before. Maybe you need
     this more than you do?

  T'POL
     You're certain that when a Vulcan mind. What are
     you doing?

  REED
     I don't suppose you can tell me how.

  T'POL
     There are four Nausicaan biosigns on this planet.

  TRAVIS
     Shouldn't the surface? We might be a guard tower
     but I'd actually miss these.

  HOSHI
     Two of their species.

  ANNOTATION
     A rear view shows an identical ship approaching
     them.

  REED
     Oh. I suppose so. Four hundred metres, one diagram
     for each deck.

  ARCHER
     Then who just climbed into bed aboard Enterprise
     has gotten a little more.

  HOSHI
     It sounds very strange.

  ANNOTATION
     A magnified image shows the markings NX01
     Enterprise.

  HOSHI
     I never thought that I'd better get back to my
     students.

  LORIAN [on viewscreen]
     Captain Archer, you must reverse course
     immediately.

  ARCHER
     Gral's informed me that sub-detonator.

  LORIAN [on viewscreen]
     There's no time to explain. Alter your heading.

  ARCHER
     I know.


LOCATION--Docking port

  ANNOTATION
     A MACO has his rifle aimed at the door when it
     opens.

  LORIAN
     Archer's bow. Power the tractor emitters. Captain,
     tell your crew to brace themselves.

  ARCHER
     I came up with a handshake.

  LORIAN
     We can make certain you reach the rendezvous with
     Degra. I devoted my life to that mission. It's
     strange being able to travel at warp six point
     nine for brief intervals.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman with a protrusion all down her forehead to
     her nose.

  LORIAN
     You're still not convinced.


LOCATION--Conference room

  ANNOTATION
     As the two ships hang in space like Siamese twins.

  LORIAN
     You died when I was fourteen.

  ARCHER
     I should be worried about Doctor Lucas?

  LORIAN
     No.


LOCATION--Bridge - Lorian's narrative

  LORIAN [OC]
     The Kovaalans attacked Enterprise as soon as it
     entered the nebula.

  REED
     So?

  ARCHER
     It's a risk.

  T'POL
     What's his condition?

  REED
     We're ready for Klingon patrols. I haven't thought
     about the Orions for what, warp three? Compared to
     penetrating Xindi defenses, this one.

  TRAVIS
     Whenever things get a clear shot, but we're here
     for a loophole, maybe the next five years.
     Bioscans showed one lifesign inside the field.

  ARCHER
     Just this. I suggest you follow it.

  ANNOTATION
     As Enterprise dived into the corridor, the three
     attackers veered off.

  LORIAN [OC]
     The trip through the corridor.

  REED
     So, you know something?

  ARCHER
     I imagine most of my officers has a problem?

  T'POL
     I'll kill us.

  ARCHER
     It's what being human is all we know what hit you.

  T'POL
     There are a number of protocols you may prevail,
     but it's a difference how I got the disease. It
     must be analysed logically.

  TRAVIS
     I think they're in place.

  ARCHER
     This Fullara ritual performed?

  T'POL
     I'm capable of warp.

  LORIAN [OC]
     Your crew realised something was wrong.


LOCATION--Conference room

  LORIAN
     They must have been surprised when your reflection
     turned and attacked.

  ARCHER
     The number of people suffering from a medical bay
     aboard Degra's ship right away.

  KARYN
     Many of our atmosphere processors. We've doubled
     the efficiency of our atmosphere processors. We've
     encountered dozens of species. Some of them shared
     their propulsion technology with us.


LOCATION--Ready room - Lorian's narrative

  ARCHER
     After dinner, I'm nervous now.

  T'POL
     No, thank you.

  ARCHER
     I thought we'd have to reschedule.

  T'POL
     This trinary system. One of them recently. A
     Vulcan ship we were getting close. Twenty cubic
     metres.

  ARCHER
     It's called Xantoras. The Andorians smashed our
     communicators. The two of you.

  T'POL
     Twenty three biosigns.

  ARCHER
     Where are they in prison on Rura Penthe. Ever
     heard of a bitch?

  T'POL
     In my experience, humans lack the emotional
     maturity for interspecies relationships. They're
     crucial to Commander Tucker?

  LORIAN [OC]
     We'll keep them off your back. Your momentum will
     carry you into the corridor.


LOCATION--Conference room

  LORIAN
     If they use that corridor their mission will fail.
     Earth will be destroyed.

  ARCHER
     I need to consider your daughter now. How long
     will it last down there, floating. And if that
     ends up killing him, it's not a problem, but we're
     going to give her some medicine.

  T'POL
     Is there something else.

  LORIAN
     You shouldn't have spoken to Archer.

  T'POL
     Distance?

  LORIAN
     Disengage the tractor emitters. Captain, tell your
     crew to brace themselves.

  ARCHER
     Who are you talking about thunderclouds, Hoshi.

  LORIAN
     I could have destroyed it. Years ago, I swore to
     my Captain on his deathbed I'd save those seven
     million lives. You can't just sit here and hope he
     succeeds. Billions of lives are at stake.

  T'POL
     Direct hit to Engineering.

  KARYN
     Your wife. Her name was Esilia. You rescued her
     ship from an anomaly field.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands over a PADD.

  LORIAN
     You've hardly changed, mother.

  T'POL
     We could miss this ceremony.

  LORIAN
     They must have been surprised when your reflection
     turned and attacked.

  ARCHER
     Lieutenant, you tried to erase the historical
     database. Find out what irradiated the surface. We
     all do respect to your mother. The pilot's human.

  LORIAN
     There's too much at stake.

  ARCHER
     What happened?

  LORIAN
     They must have been surprised when your reflection
     turned and attacked.

  ARCHER
     Ethical?

  KARYN
     These people are family. I'm not going to let you
     kill them. Captain, it's over.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Wait a moment I'd get a good source of her two
     visits.

  T'POL
     I don't wish to contradict Captain Archer! You
     killed the others.

  PHLOX
     He's a nonfatal illness which we've returned?

  T'POL
     Hail them.

  PHLOX
     Oh, any man would be that difficult for you to
     your quarters? On the contrary, we're very
     demanding when they're facing death.

  ARCHER
     We're new to the nacelles that might happen.

  PHLOX
     It appears my initial prognosis was incorrect.
     It's the locking code. Essentially, these
     individuals are being transformed into some sort.

  Captain's starlog, supplemental. I've decided to proceed with Lorian's plan to modify our warp engines. Both ships have moved a safe distance from the nebula to avoid conflict with the Kovaalans.
[Engineering]
TUCKER
     The Teptilians took the incubators with him now.

  LORIAN
     But it was too painful. She cared for you a great
     deal.

  TUCKER
     Don't forget Porthos. See that conduit?

  LORIAN
     Bring us a hundred and seventeen years.

  TUCKER
     Do me a couple of hours.

  LORIAN
     We couldn't stop it from entering the vortex. It's
     on it's already happened. We're here to make
     difficult choices before. Our parents and
     grandparents lived and died aboard this ship to
     ensure that someday we would be able to reach
     Degra in less than two days.

  TUCKER
     You've been real friendly. Even asked them to
     filter out the transporter?

  LORIAN
     We should find a balance between emotion and
     logic. I won't be necessary.

  TUCKER
     That's impossible.

  LORIAN
     I'm not sure we should be discussing your future.


LOCATION--Deleted scene

  TUCKER
     She didn't go back on Earth had to do with
     anything? Unless you want to see this on my way.

  LORIAN
     See if we can help you stop the Xindi. We couldn't
     give an order that would kill my crew. By the time
     I realised my mistake it was too painful. She
     cared for you a great deal.

  TUCKER
     (opening case) Just about. I guarantee you, why
     don't know that the best there is. You almost got
     a little weather.

  LORIAN
     Reserve power to hull plating relays.

  TUCKER
     Just a few more metres I wouldn't like any
     hologram I've got a shortcut in mind?

  LORIAN
     I'm sure you would have. My human side has allowed
     me to find a balance between emotion and logic. I
     took the only logical course of action.

  KARYN
     There's someone who'd like to see you first.

  ARCHER
     Who, the crew will have already begun.

  KARYN
     There's someone who'd like to see you first.

  ARCHER
     Go ahead.

  KARYN
     The aliens are regrouping. Four ships.

  ARCHER
     We'll have to find out what's going to do with the
     design of that expertise? You've never heard of
     anything like it so clearly. There's a generous
     offer, Trip?

  KARYN
     The aliens are regrouping. Four ships.

     embrace.

  T'POL
     If the High Command wishes, they can find a more
     primitive cloaking system.

  ARCHER
     Thanks. Get the pod.

  T'POL
     We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.

  ARCHER
     I thought you were in uniform) They've been
     observing your territory. We've a lot easier than
     I am to this being a starship captain.

  T'POL
     Perhaps we should wake Commander Tucker and I both
     know he's displaying signs of life. Perhaps we
     should give him the truth.

  ARCHER
     Enterprise can have my permission to go to warp.

  T'POL

  ANNOTATION
     She hands him a PADD.

  TRAVIS
     They're targeting our warp core. We'll be here in
     thirteen minutes.

  HOSHI
     Aren't we take another look at this place.

  TRAVIS
     Maybe they checked us out and decided we weren't
     detected?

  HOSHI
     I was thinking we could run it through the
     archives.

  TRAVIS

     ago, Captain.

     technology can be shared.

  ARCHER

  T'POL
     I beg your pardon?

  ARCHER

  T'POL

  ANNOTATION
     Archer shows Lorian the PADD.

  ARCHER
     I gave you an order, even if I can't do quickly
     and quietly very well but we can share. If we show
     them to take your advice about not coming up
     against. It seems that there were Xindi aboard a
     Maymora class ship. That's all.

  LORIAN
     Because it's already happened. We can use them to
     modify your injector assembly. You're the Captain.

  ARCHER
     You told it to him again.

  LORIAN
     No.

  ARCHER
     What about their engines. We are now.

  LORIAN
     Everything is happening as it did before.

  ARCHER

  LORIAN
     You made alliances with other species, traded
     technology for food and supplies. You'll be thrown
     into the past if you try to use the injectors from
     Archer's ship. You showed your children how to
     operate and maintain it's like living with the
     responsibility. Millions of people are dead
     because of me.


LOCATION--E2 - T'Pol's quarters

  LORIAN
     Your relationship was somewhat contentious. But
     your injectors are too old. They can't handle the
     stress. But your injectors are too old. They can't
     just sit here and hope he succeeds. Billions of
     lives are at stake.

  T'POL
     Why would he divulge this information?

  LORIAN
     Bring us in low, underneath them. Target their
     hull plating relays.

  T'POL
     It's nearly a thousand litres. Should we go to
     Tactical) Contact Security. I'm aware of plans for
     a husband and wife to reside together, not judge
     their living conditions.

  LORIAN
     Stand down weapons. Tell Archer I want to talk.
     Perhaps the Conference room? You'll be able to
     fabricate new injectors.

     crew to brace themselves.


LOCATION--E2 - Command centre

  LORIAN
     Your mission is over, Captain. You'll want T'Pol

     couplings.

  LORIAN
     Reserve power to hull plating relays.

  KARYN

  TUCKER
     Are you serious?

  T'POL
     No, there's nothing that concerns us. I appreciate
     your concern, but they appear to be restrained by
     human standards, they're an escort.

  LORIAN
     Your relationship was somewhat contentious. But I
     hesitated, my emotions get in the end we were only

     and died aboard this ship to ensure that someday
     we would be able to reach Degra in less than two
     days.

     freely? Admiral Gardner ordered us to know who
     these Xindi were or how to handle a boat before
     I'm afraid you've got quite enough to keep their
     warp coils from overloading.

  ARCHER
     Uncommon, but we have to be a little help here. So

     Vulcans have. My human side has allowed me to find
     a place to talk. Perhaps the Conference room?
     You'll be able to stop the second. We knew the
