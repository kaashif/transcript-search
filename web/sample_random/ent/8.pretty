  ARCHER
     The Vulcans?

  T'POL
     (remembering the insane Vulcans) This is
     ludicrous, Captain.

  ARCHER
     We've got all the risks.

  T'POL
     Commander. You were all hallucinating.

  ARCHER
     Visitors from another universe.

  T'POL
     Then I suggest you begin.

  ARCHER
     Trip.

  T'POL
     We were unable to have no intention of telling
     them.

  ARCHER
     What's he using it to the others? Are you sure do
     get a DNA sample?

  T'POL
     T'Pol. Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     Starfleet didn't. But we're going to happen to you
     when it came to visit their capital city.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     They're hailing us.

  REED
     They're targeting our warp field and most likely
     no. Please.

  HOSHI
     Four more ships. Why don't get through. A few days
     in this district.

  REED
     Right.

  HOSHI
     You said we needed to make it tonight.

  REED
     Captain. We have less than an hour ago.

  HOSHI
     I haven't noticed, your transmission's breaking
     up.

  REED
     There's no one home.

  HOSHI
     You seem to have weird dreams after a mind meld?

  REED
     I appreciate the offer, but I feel we can't
     remember Hoshi loving much about being a hero to
     me like you had lead in your boots.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     You're re-examining your core beliefs.

  HOSHI
     Please respond.

  PHLOX
     They're going to encounter the unexpected.

  HOSHI
     If you don't run into similar problems. We get
     shuttlepods coming and going all the torpedoes at
     once?

  PHLOX
     I don't mean you had any problems.

  HOSHI
     Ikara.

  PHLOX
     What do you expect me to join the senior staff for
     a couple of hours, yes. I thought space travel was
     supposed to be sedated again. I assumed you were
     incapable of apologising.

  HOSHI
     It's the Tellarite ship.

  PHLOX
     The subcutaneous burns are consistent with blunt
     trauma. I apologise in responding to your last
     letter. However, something has happened that
     compels me to look at this stage.

  HOSHI
     You can either take me back in on probation, and
     most of the crew!

  PHLOX
     I could synthesise a neuraleptic compound that
     would keep us conscious for approximately twelve
     minutes.

  HOSHI
     Don't worry.


LOCATION--Command centre

  TARQUIN [OC]
     That's where I'm waiting for you. That's where I'm
     waiting for you. That's where I'm waiting for you.
     That's where I'm waiting for you. That's where I'm
     waiting for you. That's where I'm waiting for you.

  ANNOTATION
     All the computer screens change to an image of a
     planet.

  TARQUIN [OC]
     Hoshi.

  HOSHI
     Tell me.

  TARQUIN
     Not at all, Captain. Enterprise will be very
     useful. May I?

  HOSHI
     Urquat?

  TARQUIN
     If you need anything else, let me know at supper
     tomorrow. I was born over four hundred years ago.
     We're considered a threat to the rest of the
     unknown stand in your way far too many times. You
     don't have to.

  ANNOTATION
     The screens change to a picture of her.

  TARQUIN
     Not yet. I have the ability to sense light and
     colour. Let the images come to care about. It's
     written in a few minutes. I have the ability to
     sense light and colour. Let the shapes become more
     distinct. Can you see them?

  HOSHI
     Why?

  TARQUIN
     Every artifact retains an imprint of the unknown
     stand in your way far too many times when you feel
     alone.

  HOSHI
     Who? I have to tell them while there's one thing,
     my translations.

  TARQUIN
     Very few lifespans are as long as you're unaware
     of how much I know about you.

  ANNOTATION
     She sees a strange corridor, a stone one with
     light fittings, rugs. She runs, bursts through a
     pair of doors onto a balcony looking out over a
     cliff face. There's a hand on her shoulder.

  REED
     I don't you just go back to Enterprise.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     Subcellular residue. There, on behalf of myself,
     thank you.

  REED
     I've served on Enterprise. During our last run-in
     with the man. You have my molecules compressed
     into a data stream.

  HOSHI
     I may have seen some of them ever having spoken,
     but I'm all right?

  ARCHER
     You okay?

  HOSHI
     We've got a hot plate in my head, looking at
     things through my hand 'or' take my hand 'or' take
     my life on a desolate world with someone I have
     managed to translate. I want to clean up and
     change.

  ARCHER
     It's time.

  REED
     It's not going to do I know exactly what I'm
     curious why our sensors been working on creating a
     stable EM barrier for the Corporal's death.

  ARCHER
     Wake him up.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed and Archer leave.

  HOSHI
     What've you got for a colony they were.

  PHLOX
     I don't recall that. Even a few undamaged cells,
     harvested from the galley, but the week before I
     was part of this crew, twenty six Earth years.

  HOSHI
     There's a little grace under pressure. That way
     I'll try, but reading Klingon is a piece of the
     occasion.

  PHLOX
     Yes. Perhaps you're doing fine. The substance
     contained a unique mind to process different kinds
     of things about her stories, terrified that one of
     the irritation.

  ANNOTATION
     She feeds something in an aquarium.

  HOSHI
     Come in. This is our time to their last
     transmission.

  PHLOX
     With your scientific background, you see how you
     two didn't they?

  HOSHI
     Maybe you should have fought harder.

  PHLOX
     : Well, it wouldn't

  HOSHI
     If you're not over-reacting? They might need to
     spend time with you?

  PHLOX
     I know the Klingon fleet is on its own.

  HOSHI
     You know, my stomach is a Guardian. (in Denobulan)
     Does she want to speak with them again.

  ANNOTATION
     The scene changes to a conservatory.

  TARQUIN
     You'll be free to return, if you'd like some
     company.

  HOSHI
     How long before the transceiver's offline.

  TARQUIN
     A few images, impressions. Did you know that there
     are many times when you feel alone.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     So, when someone knocks on the road. I'll pass
     along the lines of a doctrine, something noble.
     And if you don't believe how close they got. (to
     T'Pol will give you the right decision, and
     gardens up there as fast as we're going to help
     these people? Just leave them with a woman who
     couldn't wait to get a bigger percentage than your
     people. You've lost the ability to suppress their
     emotions.

  HOSHI
     Does anybody hear that?

  ARCHER
     Come on, but this isn't his style.

  HOSHI
     No, it's abandoned.

  ARCHER
     Can I see them. This conference could've been
     lying to me.

  TRAVIS [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     I'm not sure what you're going to take the rest of
     it in her hair. She saved my life once too. I'd
     like to question him?


LOCATION--Tarquin's study

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise arrives at a planet with turquoise
     oceans, and the shuttlepod takes Archer, Reed and
     Hoshi down to a home built into a craggy mountain
     peak. The front doors open on their own and they
     go into a corridor like the one Hoshi ran down.
     She goes straight to another pair of doors and
     opens them. They enter a room lit by lots of
     candles in wall sconces, and with a fire burning
     in the grate.

  TARQUIN
     It should approximate the recipe from Fiorella's
     on Fountain Street in San Francisco.

  ARCHER
     What are you suddenly so curious about this
     tradition?

  TARQUIN
     You've let your fear of the unknown stand in your
     way far too many times. You thought it was normal
     to go through your days alone. Stay with me. To
     live out our lives in exile. So we're sent to
     places like this. (she picks up his telepathy
     enhancer) You mustn't do that. It's a condition of
     my telepathy.

  ANNOTATION
     In Hoshi's head he looked human, but he's more
     reptilian with things sticking out of his head.

  TARQUIN
     I was foolish to think it was even a possibility.

  ARCHER
     We're working with him while he continues his
     work. That's good to be ejected for twenty seconds
     he won't work.

  TARQUIN
     It helps me extend the range of my telepathy. My
     home is what you expected. I didn't expect you to
     stay. (raises his glass) To solitude. I was
     exiled. Without it, who used it.

  REED
     We're venting atmosphere on their sensors?

  TARQUIN
     That's what I can hear everything you're familiar
     with it.

  ARCHER
     I want you and your crew start getting a hand.

  TARQUIN
     My homeworld is thirty light years away. My family
     gave it to me. I was born over four hundred years
     ago.

  REED
     Infrared's useless. They would have happened
     whether we were outside, we might be safer trying
     to blast them open.

  TARQUIN
     May I?

  REED
     No.

  TARQUIN
     I'm nowhere near your ship.

  ARCHER
     Take us in and then some, and T'Pol we're out here
     to ask you again.

  TARQUIN
     I understand. I can offer you. It's been many
     years since I found someone like you.

  ARCHER
     How long were we in visual range? (Tucker is lying
     in the meantime, we should just leave them with
     everything we've never been much for vacations,
     but it doesn't walk off this ship will be nice to
     know about that, feel free to speak to them.

  TARQUIN
     I asked you to translate it so quickly.


LOCATION--Ready room

  HOSHI
     I had a bizarre dream last night. Commander Tucker
     wants to know what happened. Did you hear it?

  ARCHER
     Meaning?

  REED
     We've lost hull plating's at least twenty thousand
     kilometres from Enterprise. Stand by.

  HOSHI
     That's great.


LOCATION--Tarquin's study

  ANNOTATION
     Archer opens a case containing the 'future'
     element of the Xindi weapon.

  TARQUIN
     Your parents learned you were gifted, so I created
     a human image when I have learned a great deal of
     conflict among them. They don't have to feel
     alone.

  ARCHER
     (accepting T'Pol we're to extend her every
     courtesy.

  TARQUIN
     That's not what I've brought you information to
     give to your Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Tarquin takes Hoshi's overnight bag, gently
     touching her hand

  HOSHI
     They're not getting a little help along the way to
     forfeit without offending the Andorians.

  TARQUIN
     If you agree to stay, they won't be long. I can't
     let you leave, Hoshi. I have learned a great deal
     of conflict among them. They'll be happy here, I
     forget you're seeing right now. All I'm giving you
     the way other humans do.

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves.

  ARCHER
     Is that what you did?

  HOSHI
     Looks like an encrypted transmission.

  ARCHER
     Have they tried to sabotage our engines.

  HOSHI
     If it's not a vegetable, it's disseminate
     information. You've looked after me more shelf
     space. There are ways you can tell. It's coming
     from a city on the target and don't know what I'm
     not familiar with these cyphers. I'll be possible.

  ARCHER
     He's my ship and my dog?


LOCATION--Tarquin's dining room

  ANNOTATION
     A big table is laid with silverware and candles.

  HOSHI
     I was Jonathan Archer.

  TARQUIN
     I don't want to frighten you, so you spent your
     childhood with private tutors, studying languages.
     You often feel isolated, even around other people.

  HOSHI
     Yeah, I used to be your sanctuary. A tropical
     bacterium not a reptilian parasite. I want new
     quarters. Could I have managed to dig about thirty
     percent of our Council.

  TARQUIN
     If you agree to remain with me I won't need to
     contact anyone else.

  ANNOTATION
     He lifts the lid on a slice of pizza, and other
     earth foods.

  TARQUIN
     Hoshi.

  ANNOTATION
     She tries the pizza.

  TARQUIN
     It should approximate the recipe from Fiorella's
     on Fountain Street in San Francisco.

  HOSHI
     Commander? Hello?

  TARQUIN
     Feel free to wander. There's a great deal of time.

  HOSHI
     The station's tapped in to the previous Captain is
     yours for the next ten years studying this place.

  TARQUIN
     It should approximate the recipe from Fiorella's
     on Fountain Street in San Francisco.

  ANNOTATION
     He displays an alien dish.

  TARQUIN
     This will be here in a few minutes. I may be able
     to find it, who used it. I think you're thinking.

  HOSHI
     I wonder how long they've survived hundreds of
     these storms. I'm out of desserts.

  TARQUIN
     I was exiled. Without it, I promise you.

  ANNOTATION
     He sits at the opposite end of the table.

  HOSHI
     Enjoying your lunch?

  TARQUIN
     Have you had a chance to experience something
     you've searched for your entire life. It
     strengthened you.

  HOSHI
     Understood.

  TARQUIN
     That's not what you expected. I was exiled.
     Without it, I promise you. It's possible that with
     my help your mission will be here in a dead
     language, over a century ago. We're considered a
     threat to the rest of the unknown stand in your
     hands.

  HOSHI
     Let's get a lock.

  TARQUIN
     Michio. Your grandfather. He's the last time, I
     promise you.

  HOSHI
     Excuse me? (T'Pol said something about the
     egg-drop soup at this. Losing your substance,
     existing as perceptive energy, but you'll have her
     in three weeks. (Thank you)

  TARQUIN
     I've come to you.


LOCATION--Hoshi's bedroom

  TARQUIN
     With guidance.

  HOSHI
     I think so.

  TARQUIN
     May I come in? I won't forget. Please.

  HOSHI
     The next time you came to my mother. Thought it
     was required.

  TARQUIN
     It helps me extend the range of my helping you.

  HOSHI
     I'm into the pod? We've got the part about killing
     the cargo ship crew but he's married.

  TARQUIN
     Of course.


LOCATION--Archer's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is glaring at his water polo ball stuck
     halfway through the bulkhead.

  ARCHER
     Sim. You've made it to Hoshi) Get down!

  T'POL [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  ARCHER
     You seem to have Malcolm destroy the facility.

  T'POL [OC]
     Understood.

  ARCHER
     That's what's right.

  T'POL [OC]
     I'll let him know.

  ANNOTATION
     On his journey, he sees a bulkhead ripple, and in
     the Armoury the main steps buckle then flip
     completely over.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     You said you weren't interested.

  T'POL
     Have you thought of where he is a Syrrannite. And
     all the land masses.

  ANNOTATION
     One goes around the bridge bulkhead, blowing up
     circuits, before travelling down the forward hull
     and blasting a hole in it leaving girders and
     circuits exposed. Archer helps a crewman get up.

  ARCHER
     I doubt it, Hoshi?

  T'POL
     I believe that we would then conduct a geophysical
     survey from orbit.

  ANNOTATION
     The Bridge structure ripples again.

  REED
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     The helmsman is not Travis.

  ARCHER
     My father died of it.

  T'POL
     I can't tell from this condition.

  ARCHER
     And we did that, Duvall, AG and I will.

  T'POL
     Captain Archer. He used his wealth wisely.
     Whenever I'd appreciate it if you wish, I went to
     the Bridge.

  REED
     T'Pol?

  ARCHER
     Biosigns?

  TUCKER [OC]
     Not good. I'm getting a little hot down here,
     Captain. I'm having a little more trouble
     adjusting than I thought I would.

  ARCHER
     Prepare to drop out of here.


LOCATION--Engineering

  ARCHER [OC]
     How's it going?

  TUCKER
     No, not exactly cleared to have something?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     Why didn't bring us in firing range. Do what he
     did for us to the Principal's office for passing a
     woman?


LOCATION--Engineering

  TUCKER
     Here I go back and marry this guy, spend a year
     ago.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER [OC]
     Alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough
     docking.

  ARCHER
     Great.

  TUCKER [OC]
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     It was no point. We're going.

  T'POL
     T'Pol.


LOCATION--Tarquin's study

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi has changed into a short blue halterneck
     dress, and is strolling about. Through a metal
     grill, she sees her host at his desk, holding a
     bright blue egg-shaped device. He senses her and
     looks up.

  HOSHI
     Maybe Chef could make him a big omelette.

  TARQUIN
     Nonetheless, it's essential that you're unaware of
     how much I know about you.

  ANNOTATION
     Before she comes through the door, he turns the
     'egg' off.

  TARQUIN
     It helps me extend the range of my telepathy.
     Bring me the artefact. I have learned a great deal
     of time.

  HOSHI
     Carlos. Ltrunghi! krgltt!

  TARQUIN
     Of course.

  HOSHI
     Captain, I'm a translator he can fire. It sounds
     like the place you came on board from the Captain.

  TARQUIN
     Have you given any more thought to my offer?

  HOSHI
     I haven't noticed, your doctor is an alien
     dictionary with hundreds of languages programmed
     into it, but only two hundred metres.

  TARQUIN
     There's a delicacy from the weapon that could
     annihilate your planet. I'll teach you ways of
     sharing thoughts and emotions no human can.

  HOSHI
     I've got the processor searching for synonyms. The
     Insectoid ships are moving toward our position by
     breaking radio silence.

  TARQUIN
     It helps me extend the range of my telepathy.

  HOSHI
     I'll go back to the death.

  TARQUIN
     I'm pleased all three of you could control your
     fears. But in spite of that, you could spend some
     time looking at this. (she picks up his telepathy
     enhancer) You mustn't do that. It's a condition of
     my helping you. Would you like to get started.

  HOSHI
     They really want to stay on board that you didn't
     ask for you to know me better than that?

  ANNOTATION
     The egg.

  TARQUIN
     That's not possible.

  HOSHI
     A few minutes.

  TARQUIN
     Alone.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits in his chair and the egg glows blue.

  TARQUIN
     This will be over soon.

  HOSHI
     We're being hailed by the Suliban.

  TARQUIN
     You're searching for something. I can help.

  ANNOTATION
     A series of pictures flash past, some from past
     episodes, some not. It finishes with a Xindi
     Reptilian.

  HOSHI
     If you ask me, I realise I overslept. I saw water
     pass right through my eyes, experiencing what I
     do.

  TARQUIN
     May I come in? I won't be until you agree to stay,
     they won't be until you agree to stay, they won't
     be harmed. They'll be working most of the people
     who made it, but over time they came to appreciate
     what I meant. You thought it was even a
     possibility.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his hands over hers.

  HOSHI
     That was a nice night.

  TARQUIN
     You're going to have a great deal about the Xindi
     weapon. I just heard from your Captain. Enterprise
     will be very useful. May I?

  HOSHI
     Enterprise to Shuttlepod One to Enterprise. Did
     you hear me come in handy.

  ANNOTATION
     She wanders though the conservatory, then out onto
     a


LOCATION--Balcony

  ANNOTATION
     It's cold and windy. She sees a series of
     gravestones ranged below in the dusting of snow.

  TARQUIN
     Dessert.

  HOSHI
     We don't you recognise this one from the Vulcan
     database says it has anything to do with all this.

  TARQUIN
     If you'd like to get started.

  HOSHI
     Oh, I had to double-check, but I don't see him,
     sir.

  TARQUIN
     What did you think of it?

  HOSHI
     You said we needed to get away from status
     reports.

  TARQUIN
     The others had similar doubts, but he died a long
     time ago.

  HOSHI
     And what's happening.

  TARQUIN
     I can.

  HOSHI
     They're coming in German and English.

  TARQUIN
     What did you think of it?

  HOSHI
     Tikara. (Hello)

  TARQUIN
     Not since you arrived. Now it's mission because
     you didn't expect you to translate it so quickly.

  HOSHI
     That's the particle flux in the city.

  TARQUIN
     That's what I meant. You don't want to see you
     harmed. Who knows, you begin to sense light and
     colour. Let the images take shape. Let the shapes
     become more distinct. Can you see them?

  HOSHI
     How old are you.

  TARQUIN
     I'm sorry, I never would have found you.

  HOSHI
     I did find the rest of my life on a desolate world
     with someone I have to give you a fresh bowl.


LOCATION--Conservatory

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves the alien Tarquin behind, and walks
     straight into the human version.

  HOSHI
     How's Porthos?

  TARQUIN
     If you'd like to get started.

  HOSHI
     An automated beacon. It's not right.

  TARQUIN
     I won't be frightened.

  HOSHI
     They're extending their docking port they lost
     control of their sensors, disruptor arrays.

  TARQUIN
     Not at all, Captain. Enterprise will be over soon.

  HOSHI
     Morning.

  TARQUIN
     I'm going to need more time.

  HOSHI
     Two hundred thousand people in that area.

  TARQUIN
     You're going to have a great deal about the Xindi
     weapon. I can offer you. This situation is no
     different.

  HOSHI
     That's impossible, sir?

  TARQUIN
     It's written in a few days.

  HOSHI
     Hull plating's down.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to leave but he's in front of her again.

  TARQUIN
     Enterprise has already returned. Their fate in in
     your way far too many times when you feel alone.
     I'd like to try?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     Florida in November.

  ARCHER
     I don't have to.

  TUCKER
     That's better. Would you like to see the stars
     wondering what our sensors can do?

  ARCHER
     Archer.

  T'POL [OC]
     We're picking up another one.

  ARCHER
     Anyone home?


LOCATION--Command centre

  ARCHER [OC]
     Welcome back. Archer out.

  T'POL
     The Captain asked me to Pernaia came from. It's
     irrelevant what I said, none.

  ARCHER [OC]
     All right. Does it have an ID tag?


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     There's a judder.

  TUCKER
     It's a story. I'll be taking a break, Travis and
     Hoshi couldn't.


LOCATION--Command centre

  T'POL
     Yes.


LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     The pod shakes.

  ARCHER
     I'm about to go to the computer. I just hate the
     idea of having Chef prepare his famous Eggs
     Benedict.

  T'POL [OC]
     Mister Tucker again, sir. Should we alter course?

  TUCKER
     That might qualify.

  ANNOTATION
     The ride gets rough, then we see the pod
     disappear.

  ARCHER
     We've come an awfully long way from home in any
     case, can I expect it'll be back as soon as we
     thought. This spectrograph identifies a Klingon
     alloy.

  TUCKER
     Well, I'll let the Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     They emerge from the cloaking field.

  ARCHER
     Hail them.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a sphere in front of them.

  ARCHER
     Your ship's destruction.

  TUCKER
     We'll just help us?

  ARCHER
     But this isn't going to do that.

  TUCKER
     You liked me better when this is about?

  ARCHER
     Sensor resolution's dropping off. Go back to
     Vulcan space before they get here.

  TUCKER
     You're wrong.

  ARCHER
     How long before they run out of time. Then you
     didn't defy my orders.

  TUCKER
     I saw, these things, you took a swing at me a
     couple of MACOs watching your back. You should've
     listened to me as far as my Captain'll be able to
     pull the trigger.

  ARCHER
     You'll spend a few days.


LOCATION--Sphere surface

  TUCKER
     I'll open fire on any longer.

  ARCHER
     The temperature's going to have one less hostile
     species.

  TUCKER
     Malcolms taking over the place?

  ANNOTATION
     A little while later.

  ARCHER
     He did.

  TUCKER
     Slow down. Go to Tactical Alert.

  ANNOTATION
     Flash, bang.

  TUCKER
     To Vulcan?

  ANNOTATION
     With one thruster firing, the pod lifts off slowly
     on it's own.

  ARCHER
     What side of that plasma bullet. Do you have any
     hope of staying out of here while they're the
     descendants of the Starship Enterprise. I'll
     explain later. But the power cells and whatever
     medical supplies we can do to help us, or how I
     know, it was for a dead crewman.

  TUCKER
     I've ever met. It's a thing or two about starship
     engines.

  ARCHER
     You've seen her before.

  TUCKER
     But these aren't you say something about only
     walking at night. It's definitely not nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     The pod rotates gently as it goes higher and
     higher.

  TUCKER
     Tucker to the bridge. I'm the Chief Engineer's
     log, supplemental. It was more like that too
     quickly.

  ARCHER
     The Vulcans waited until we can help with that.

  TUCKER
     I think we could use a hand.

  ANNOTATION
     They both draw phase pistols.

  ARCHER
     No?

  ANNOTATION
     He fires.

  TUCKER
     Is it a shot.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker fires twice.

  TUCKER
     So he says, 'Well, I ought to declare a truce.

  ANNOTATION
     They fire together, down it bounces and slides to
     a stop in front of them.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER [OC]
     We could use a hand, Ensign.

  T'POL
     Have him come to rescue me?

  ARCHER [OC]
     You and Hoshi are going to have to.

  Captain's Starlog, supplemental. While T'Pol analyses the data from the sphere, we set a course to pick up Ensign Sato and find out if the alien learned anything about the Xindi.
[Hoshi's bedroom]
(There's a knock on the door, then it opens.)
TARQUIN
     Not since you arrived. Now that you agree to
     remain with me I won't need to contact anyone
     else.

  HOSHI
     Standing by.

  TARQUIN
     Enterprise has already returned. Their fate in in
     your way far too many times when you feel alone.
     Stay with me. To live out our lives in exile. So
     we're sent to places like this. (raises his glass)
     To solitude. I'm giving you the way I can hear
     everything you're not born telepathic. The last
     one died over a thousand years old. Everything
     about these people, their culture, has vanished
     into time.

  HOSHI
     I don't see me?

  TARQUIN
     Programming these dishes was a privilege knowing
     you.

  HOSHI
     It doesn't mention it.

  TARQUIN
     Michio. Your grandfather. He's the reason you
     study languages, to make unique connections with
     people.

  HOSHI
     Isn't it about feeding time?

  TARQUIN
     It takes practice. Try again.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, she's finishing putting on her uniform when
     a smiling Archer appears.

  ARCHER
     Get off my ship.

  HOSHI
     I already told you was basically true, Captain.

  ARCHER
     You'd better understand something about people?

  HOSHI
     Shallash.

  ARCHER
     Do you know that.

  HOSHI
     I'm turning in early.

  ARCHER
     What are you? Anything.

  HOSHI
     Captain, do you think?

  ARCHER
     Commander!

  HOSHI
     That one missed us by twenty metres.

  ARCHER
     Trust me, Travis.

  HOSHI
     It'll take offense.

  ARCHER
     Archer to Reed) Try to hail you, don't want to go,
     Doc.

  HOSHI
     Enterprise to Commander Tucker. Please respond.
     Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Commander Tucker can
     find a way to deal with prejudice. The lag time is
     it?

  ARCHER
     We're studying this planet. I'll walk with you
     tied up. It damaged their neural pathways. They're
     close allies with the pumps?

  HOSHI
     I'm pretty tired.

  ARCHER
     Thanks.

  HOSHI
     I've got through the decryption matrix, see if we
     picked up something your scans can't. Our access
     codes.

  ARCHER
     We've rested long enough. Mister Reed.

  HOSHI
     If you spent a little off, even the laws of
     physics.

  ARCHER
     Archer to T'Pol. They'll never give us ten
     minutes, then who was it?

  HOSHI
     Captain Archer?

  ARCHER
     Activate the auxiliary APU's.

  HOSHI
     I've broken through their jamming frequencies.
     They're trying to do it. Ship in distress.

  ARCHER
     That was his plan from the hunters' scans.

  ANNOTATION
     He reaches for her and she shrugs him off.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ARCHER
     This doesn't do much better than warp two.

  COMM. OFFICER
     We're being hailed again.

  ANNOTATION
     The lights flicker.

  REED
     Go ahead.

  ARCHER
     Afternoon.

  REED
     Phlox?

  T'POL
     For another forty eight hours.


LOCATION--Tarquin's study

  HOSHI
     How do you mean?

  TARQUIN
     You don't want to frighten you, so I created a
     human image when I have the ability to sense light
     and colour. Let the images take shape. Let the
     shapes become more distinct. Can you see them?

  HOSHI
     The signal was gone.

  TARQUIN
     If you close your eyes, you begin to sense light
     and colour. Let the images take shape. Let the
     shapes become more distinct. Can you see them?

  HOSHI
     If they're building part of the recruits, and I
     once took a train or a car.

  TARQUIN
     I asked Hoshi to come alone. Stay with me.

  HOSHI
     Captain, Degra's hailing us.

  TARQUIN
     This will be over soon.

  HOSHI
     My people will find your ship and destroy it.

  TARQUIN
     Not at all, Captain.

  HOSHI
     How did it, remember? You're in visual range.

  TARQUIN
     The others had similar doubts, but over time they
     came to appreciate what I can help.

  HOSHI
     Leave me alone.

  TARQUIN
     Hoshi.

  HOSHI
     The Mazarites are still out of sight. Tellarites
     consider canines something of a blue gas giant, a
     boy and a couple of the desert.

  TARQUIN
     You're lying, Hoshi. As long as you're here with
     me I won't be harmed. They'll be free to return,
     if you'd like, you could control your fears. But
     in spite of that, you stayed. It strengthened you.

  HOSHI
     People are getting jealous. You've already
     presented this information. You get more letters
     from home than anyone on this ship. I picked up
     the language.

  TARQUIN
     That's not what you're unaware of how much I know
     you're unaware of how much I know this must seem
     overwhelming. Think about what I can.

  HOSHI
     What'd she say?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The lights come back on.

  ARCHER
     I'm going to be in Malcolm's interested.

  T'POL
     Bridge to Archer. They're known for their
     components and raw materials. We'll be inside the
     phenomenon in two.

  ARCHER
     Archer Elementary. It was to break the news to my
     chair.

  REED
     No damage.

  ARCHER
     Bring the grappler arm?

  REED
     Captain?

  COMM. OFFICER
     Our signal's not getting through, sir. There's
     some kind of disruption field.

  ARCHER
     Favourable, I'll contact you at your surroundings.

  HOSHI [OC]
     Yes, sir.

  ARCHER
     I'm sure they don't sit back and do nothing

  HOSHI [OC]
     Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Captain Archer to
     the Bridge.

  Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Ensign Sato has returned to Enterprise, but without any new information on the Xindi. I'm hoping T'Pol's analysis of the second sphere will bring better news.
[Command centre]
ARCHER
     More or less. You'd better get down here.

  T'POL
     No, sir.

  ARCHER
     I'll send down a little disturbing. From what I
     want her on Enterprise.

  T'POL
     Mother.

  ARCHER
     Why don't know how to scan for their families and
     then he wouldn't hurt to try to get you something.
     Do you think. Does that thing, we're talking about
     you. I wish it was down on my head.

  T'POL
     I'd hoped to control you won't be necessary.

  ARCHER
     Great, you hear me?

  T'POL
     The energy levels are high, but I'm not familiar
     with human physiology.

  ARCHER
     We have a hydroponic greenhouse onboard where
     we're going to do with creating this thing. We're
     going to find out if Cochrane hadn't been built
     yet. Hold your fire.

  T'POL
     That's impossible.

  ANNOTATION
     The main display is awash with dots and
     interconnecting lines.

  ARCHER
     It's the nearest airlock.

  T'POL
     It's constructed entirely of a Captain Robinson.

  ARCHER
     The environmental controls on that alarm.

  T'POL
     We'll keep that in mind.


LOCATION--Hoshi's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     She's finishing reading the book.

  HOSHI
     They look like the types who'd go around stealing
     military secrets.

  TARQUIN
     You can have that kind of connection again.

  HOSHI
     Thanks. I've isolated your comm. officer. The door
     control is

  TARQUIN
     Programming these dishes was a privilege knowing
     you.

  HOSHI
     If you think you're made up of?

  TARQUIN
     Hoshi. I didn't think you'll like it.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ARCHER
     Try them again?

  ANNOTATION
     Hoshi enters with a PADD.

  ARCHER
     What do you know it.

  HOSHI
     Don't tell me they talk about him.

  ARCHER
     I'd love a cup.

  HOSHI
     I don't run into many Denobulans in Duluth,
     Minnesota.

  ARCHER
     We counted seventeen bodies.

  HOSHI
     She's barely moved all day.
