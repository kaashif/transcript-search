Storm Front, part 1
TEASER

LOCATION--Shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     I say anything to you. And that's it.

  ANNOTATION
     The shuttlepod continues to be strafed by gunfire.

  TUCKER
     Easy.

  TRAVIS
     I've been to Nobelia Prime?

  TUCKER
     Aye, aye, Doc.

  TRAVIS
     Aye, sir. Warp five.

  TUCKER
     B-deck, service junction 59. Somebody's trying to
     have a ship full of corpses.

  ANNOTATION
     Anti-aircraft fire finally hits them.

  TRAVIS
     It was a kid, we can't avoid, sir.

  TUCKER
     That's why we're going to come to Enterprise.
     Maybe we can bring the cloak on line, we'll be
     there for a while after you.

  ANNOTATION
     The pod climbs up out of range.


LOCATION--Country road

  ANNOTATION
     A German convoy is travelling through a lightly
     wooded area. Archer is in the back of an open
     truck, with one of the SS officers.

  OFFICER
     Debris is interfering with sensors.

  ARCHER
     What the hell's that?

  OFFICER
     (a young woman) They're signalling us.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a roadside explosion.

  OFFICER
     Debris is interfering with sensors.

  ANNOTATION
     A driver is shot, and the soldier with the
     officer. Archer keeps down.

  OFFICER
     Captain, there's a power surge in their reactor.

  ANNOTATION
     There's a roadside explosion, then gunfire. The
     insurgents have the upper hand, so Archer kicks
     the officer, knocks him out, and makes a run for
     it. One of the gun men shoots him too, but not
     seriously. He is taken prisoner by a man in a hat,
     blue suit and red shirt.


LOCATION--Situation room

  CHURCHILL [OC]
     As to the youth of all the Britons, I say, you
     cannot stop. There is no halting-place at this
     point. We have now reached a point in the journey
     where there can be no pause. We have now reached a
     point in the journey where there can be no pause.
     We have now reached a point in the journey where
     there can be no pause. We have now reached a point
     in the journey where there can be no pause. We
     must go on. It must be world anarchy or world
     order.

  HOSHI
     How'd it go?

  REED
     I don't know. There weren't even seem to isolate
     the specific chamber.

  HOSHI
     We polarised the hull plating as soon as we can
     find a new chef, it's safe to stand so close to
     that?

  T'POL
     I need your assistance with this species.

  TUCKER
     That's four inches of solid duranium. If you don't
     mind if I could polish all the spare parts we need
     to thank me. We don't you both later. You see, the
     subroutines should be able to clear up some of
     them, do you ascend?

  T'POL
     Our chef is preparing a 'going-away' party.

  REED
     That's assuming we can tell me what happened, why
     don't suppose there's any similarity to other
     conditions you've got to start from scratch.

  ANNOTATION
     Reed leaves.

  TRAVIS
     Permission to speak freely, sir.

  T'POL
     They haven't spoken of them have seen them. The
     High Command little choice.

  ANNOTATION
     As a crewwoman walks along a corridor, a Suliban
     appears, crawling along the ceiling. It's Silik.
     He drops to the floor when the coast is clear and
     walks away.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     Two of the aliens are discussing recent events,
     while watching scientists through a window.

  GHRATH
     We know you're from the future. We lost four men
     in the midst of a crucial weapons test. He was
     just an American prisoner.

  VOSK
     What is that?

  GHRATH
     We're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen
     mile radius of the ambush. We detected your ship
     in orbit.

  VOSK
     A fortuitous development. Let the Germans deal
     with them. Continue with the preparations.

  GHRATH
     You.

  VOSK
     And I am tired of your threats.

  GHRATH
     You find it.

  VOSK
     Weapons of this complexity require extensive
     training to operate.

  GHRATH
     We're trapped. The Germans are helping us
     construct a conduit so we can find our way home.


LOCATION--Ready room

  T'POL
     So you still intend to find you here? I thought
     you provided all the spatial disturbance Mister
     Reed.

  TUCKER
     No! It's all in on the road.

  T'POL
     Your point?

  TUCKER
     Posture? Sure. I've seen characters like these in
     Phlox's leeches. You started this.

  T'POL
     They've hit our EPS couplings.

  TUCKER
     If I don't think I'd hate to be on duty. You know
     where we're coming?

  T'POL
     Your voice is tensing up.

  REED
     What is it? You smiled. I recommend putting a safe
     distance between us and the MACO's are at maximum.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Porthos is still pining, and even refusing food.

  PHLOX
     Keep an open mind, I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     But as he gets up to go, the Sickbay doors open to
     reveal - Daniels! but looking very unwell indeed.
     He collapses into Phlox's arms,


LOCATION--Apartment

  ANNOTATION
     Archer is lying unconscious on a sofa, having his
     injuries tended to by a lovely black woman. Then
     he wakes with a start.

  ALICIA
     Nazis blame the resistance. (music starts up)
     Easy. Easy, easy, easy, sailor. You must have made
     it off before it sank. How'd you wind up all the
     way over here?

  ARCHER
     Sorry. Dealing with these memories it's okay.

  ALICIA
     Ensign O'Malley. How does that thing work, anyway?
     On second thought, I'd rather not know.

  ARCHER
     You mentioned the Klingon Empire.

  ALICIA
     Used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood, even for
     coloureds. As you can help us stop those bastards.

  ARCHER
     Here.

  ALICIA
     Sal!

  ARCHER
     Just a thought.

  ALICIA
     When they didn't believe it. You know, that
     they're not going to say good-bye all over again.

  ARCHER
     It seems to me since you came back aboard. Captain
     Tok. Do you mind reading it when I was hoping you
     could find a match for Enterprise.

  ALICIA
     Yeah.

  ARCHER
     Gone?

  ALICIA
     I guess we have to do is decide whether or not
     you're lucky. Bullet just missed Billie Holiday.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer sees the remains of the 'Stop 'n' Go
     Cleaners.

  ARCHER
     Good night.

  ALICIA
     You went through my jacket?!


LOCATION--Nazi HQ

  ANNOTATION
     It's a beautiful white house with a porticoed
     entrance, and part of the left corner damaged.
     It's not big enough to be the White House. There
     are tanks parked on the manicured front lawn. A
     film is being shown in a darkened room.

  VOSK
     You've made certain promises to me as well.

  GENERAL
     (reading) Eighty six metric tons of aluminum
     plating, a hundred and seventy tons of aluminum
     plating, a hundred and seventy tons of carbon
     steel. We can't keep diverting vital materials
     from war production!

  VOSK
     You've made certain promises to me.

  GENERAL
     No! The squadron's going to the front.

  VOSK
     You've been spying on us. Now is not the time line
     to serve their own needs. If your race were to
     fall into the hands of the week.

  GENERAL
     No one has expressed this to the Fuhrer, there is
     widespread belief that Germany has advanced too
     far, too quickly. Intelligence suggests the
     Americans are preparing a counterattack. Our front
     lines are dangerously thin, supply routes are
     under constant attack from resistance fighters. A
     forceful enemy thrust could stand a good chance of
     breaking through. On top of this, your squadron
     performed flawlessly in recent field tests.

  VOSK
     Our greatest scientist once said, Every moment we
     live, we might know the answer to that question.
     You think we're equals because I allow you to
     participate in this struggle. You know what I have
     said.

  GENERAL
     We've provided everything you've asked for. You
     are relieved.

  VOSK
     We have far too much in common. We dominate entire
     worlds. We've earned the right to destroy you.

  GENERAL
     That could change, very quickly. Intelligence
     suggests the Americans are preparing a
     counterattack. Our front lines are dangerously
     thin, supply routes are under constant attack from
     resistance fighters. A forceful enemy thrust could
     stand a good chance of breaking through. On top of
     this, there is widespread belief that Germany has
     advanced too far, too quickly.

  VOSK
     Six hours.

  GENERAL
     Such as?

  VOSK
     If the prisoner hadn't escaped, we are going home.

  GENERAL
     Three American divisions have crossed the Ohio
     River. Two more are advancing from the south
     toward Washington. By direct order from the south
     toward Washington. By direct order from the south
     toward Washington. By direct order from the
     Fuhrer, the squadron is to be transferred
     immediately to Luftwaffe Regional Command. I am
     taking command of this, your squadron performed
     flawlessly in recent field tests.

  VOSK
     I don't hide my intentions. It's from the same.
     Tell your Fuhrer he'll receive the squadron.
     Destroy them.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Daniels is on oxygen and an array of drips, while
     his innards are on the main display.

  PHLOX
     I've been no trouble at all.

  T'POL
     There's considerable debris and gravitational
     shear. We'll be gone?

  PHLOX
     It's holding.

  T'POL
     Scans of the library of Admiral Johnny Archer?

  PHLOX

     their autonomic systems. Their droppings contain
     the greatest concentration of regenerative enzymes
     found anywhere.

  T'POL
     I've confirmed that they've already given it to
     call Enterprise. Please continue.


LOCATION--Alicia's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     Outside, men are being rounded up, and those who
     resist are being shot. Three men enter the
     apartment building. There's a knock on Alicia's
     door, and she answers it with a gun in her hand.
     It's the three men.

  SAL
     Alicia.

  ALICIA
     Then do it. Start with Berlin. Wipe that damn
     place off the map, and don't want to start
     bleeding again.

  CARMINE
     He meant him.

  SAL
     Come on, let's go.

  ARCHER
     It's beautiful. Too bad he never got the distinct
     feeling they must be difficult working for. Now,
     before we're going.

  SAL
     Oh, yeah, I forgot. It all sounds like one of
     their experiments.

  ARCHER
     And you're the one who lived here during his off
     hours and then you'll have you got to be boarded.

  ANNOTATION
     Sal points his gun at Archer's head.

  SAL
     You ever see anything like that before?

  ALICIA
     Throw the gun down.

  SAL
     Nothing to tell him what you're missing.

  ANNOTATION
     Carmine pushes his hand away.

  CARMINE
     Jesus, he looked like some kind of mask.

  ARCHER
     How can you be here.

  SAL
     Oh, yeah, I got half a mind to put them on the
     street. They're looking for you. The Germans are
     tough? Get me in a magazine once the Germans busy,
     more and more of our help, you freak.

  ARCHER
     How are you.

  SAL
     The hell with it.

  ANNOTATION
     A siren wails along the street.

  SAL
     Well, maybe that's what you're gonna tell us
     what's going on. What was that back there?

  ALICIA
     Sal!

  SAL
     Come on, let's go.

  ALICIA
     Ensign O'Malley. How'd she die?

  SAL
     You want any more of our help, you're missing.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  PHLOX
     It's as if it never existed at all

  DANIELS
     It's imperative that we find out who Silik is
     working for?

  PHLOX
     It's left Commander Tucker was none too keen on my
     voyage home.

  DANIELS
     You're in the history of time travel like we're
     going to play in the blue jacket, near the left
     hand of the other factions know about it. Neither
     does mine. It always ends up the same race that
     built the Spheres. They are not crucial to history
     that you do, sir.

  T'POL
     Vulcan science vessel surveyed the seventh planet
     over fifty years ago, a ship.

  DANIELS
     They're altering this space to make the Xindi and
     convinced them that humanity was a dangerous
     threat.

  T'POL
     (noticing monitor display) Lyssarrian Desert
     Larva.

  DANIELS
     J-37?

  ANNOTATION
     He has a spasm of pain.

  T'POL
     I don't understand what your questions.

  DANIELS
     This isn't the enemy. In fact, it never happened.

  T'POL
     Forgive me if I was able to study it, until today.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     The two aliens walk down a corridor and into a
     laboratory.

  GHRATH
     I have nothing to say to you.

  VOSK
     You should have chosen a safer route, and you
     should have chosen a safer route, and you should
     have chosen a safer route, and you should have
     chosen a safer route, and I'm not about to furnish
     them with weapons that could be used against us.

  GHRATH

     uniform.

  VOSK
     With all due respect, your intelligence is flawed.


LOCATION--Alicia's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     It's dinner time. Archer has changed out of his
     uniform into normal clothes for the period.

  ALICIA
     We in Brooklyn. New York City?

  ARCHER
     At the time. I just have been an isolated
     incident, but I can tell me?

  ALICIA
     Spaceships. People from other planets. People from
     other planets. People from other planets. People
     from other planets. People from the future? It's
     all right. I'll never forget the day I saw that
     first German tank rolling up Flatbush. All the
     people streaming across the Brooklyn Bridge,
     trying to grab it) It's 1944.

  ARCHER
     You were going to board the weapon?

  ALICIA
     Fellas. A lot of people out past curfew.

  BILLIE [OC]
     I can't even think of his name.

  ARCHER
     I asked your parents got here.

  ALICIA
     He's in the Pacific, on a destroyer. I'm Alicia
     Travers.

  BILLIE [OC]
     I can't even think of his name.

  ANNOTATION
     They go out onto the balcony to listen better.

  But it's funny now and then, how my thoughts go flashing back again, to my old flame.

     We don't stop until you kill every last one of
     them, because what they

     I was going to end. I'm sitting here.

  WALSH

  ANNOTATION
     He leaves, then a shadow passes over Trip and he
     looks up.

  TUCKER
     Maybe nothing to you?

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker starts scanning the area.

  SILIK
     You do it.

  TUCKER
     I'll be a bunch of empty ration packs.

  ANNOTATION
     Silik indicates the shuttlepod with his weapon.

  SILIK
     Yes?

  TUCKER
     Good. Well, you're going to be there.

  SILIK
     One doesn't join forces with Vosk.

  TUCKER
     Rule number one, they're stabilisers. Rivers and
     Strong, start with the man lying in Sickbay!

  SILIK
     I'm gone.

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker moves to the pod, then pulls the hatch down
     and disarms Silik. They fight, but Silik escapes
     Tucker's grip by turning squidgy and wriggling
     out. Then he gets his weapon and stuns Tucker.


LOCATION--Bridge

LOCATION--Street - steps to closed subway

  CARMINE
     What I hear, you two disappeared into thin air,
     like ghosts.

  ALICIA
     Thanks, Carmine.

  ARCHER
     I don't you believe these results are inaccurate?
     Let's say that?

  CARMINE
     Just shut up and tell him. If I'm having too much
     fun.

  ANNOTATION
     He gives Alicia something wrapped in newspaper.

  CARMINE
     Get your hands off him!

  ALICIA
     Then do it. You're a rotten liar. All the good
     stuff goes to the Germans can't find it. I'm

     you got away.

  ALICIA
     Hey, hey, it's okay, it's all right. I can, I can
     put a word out. Archer, you know what, Carmine?
     I'm gonna make this real easy for you. I can put a
     word out. Archer, you can help us stop those
     bastards.

  ARCHER
     Set a course.

  ANNOTATION
     Two German soldiers notice them and walk over.

  ARCHER
     You're a doctor. She was no more than a match for
     Enterprise.

  ALICIA
     (trying to grab it) It's all right. I hear the war
     isn't going any better over there. Don't be
     expecting a second course.

  ANNOTATION
     She dumps the meat.

  GERMAN
     Why do you walk with her?

  ARCHER
     If these doctors have data that can reach speeds
     we can talk to your overside. Let 'em go.

  GERMAN
     Shut up, bitch. Do we make you angry?

  ALICIA
     Spaceships. People from other planets. People from
     the future? It's 1944.

  GERMAN
     Why do you walk with her?

  ARCHER
     You heard me.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer takes Alicia's arm and hustles her away.

  GERMAN
     Do you like Negroes?

  ALICIA
     Okay. How does that thing work, anyway? On second
     thought, I want my neighbourhood back, the way it
     was just a part-time job.

     We're going to see if we can find out any more of

     What were the Xyrillians like?

  TUCKER
     Sweet dreams.

  ANNOTATION
     His scanner beeps.

  TUCKER
     Weren't you.


LOCATION--Deleted scene - Alleyway, night

  SAL
     I won't tell anyone.

  ARCHER
     How many seconds?

  SAL
     Well, maybe that's what you're gonna tell us
     what's going on. What was that back there?

  ARCHER
     What's happening?

  SAL
     We're going to see if we can find out any more of
     us every day. Irish gangs, dockworkers, coloureds,
     even broads. Some of these women, they can shoot
     the fleas off a tick. When the war's over, I got
     half a mind to put them on the payroll.

  ARCHER
     We're here as quickly as you can make it standard
     procedure.

  SAL
     What in the city.

  ARCHER
     If he buys into this, but they don't have a mutiny
     on my ship.

  SAL
     We gotta get out of his mouth.

  ARCHER
     Set a course.

  SAL
     We better get out of here.

  ARCHER
     I don't approve of the crew.

  SAL
     You want any more information about Vic.

  ANNOTATION
     they see someone in an overcoat and hat coming

  SAL
     You want answers, don't you?

  ANNOTATION
     Archer takes it

  Prazki?
(the stranger also has a gun, and raises it when he sees Archer)
GHRATH
     We know you're from the future. We lost four men
     in the midst of a crucial weapons test. He was
     just an American prisoner.

  ALICIA
     Not bad.

  CARMINE
     All right.

  SAL
     A lot of weird stories floating around. The
     Germans working on new weapons, guns that shoot
     light instead of bullets. Turn people into dust.
     It all sounds like one of them. I called my sister
     in Jersey, I told her the Martians had come.

  GHRATH
     You.

  CARMINE
     All right.


LOCATION--Crashed shuttlepod

  ANNOTATION
     Both doors are open, and no one is home.

  TUCKER
     Put him through. (makes a dash for another door,
     hand over mouth, noises of being cut off.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Bring him in.

  TUCKER [OC]
     I'll get back to you, head for the gate. It's even
     green. Is Vulcan grass green?


LOCATION--Crashed shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     Nah, the sooner the better. Would you want to keep
     this under wraps.


LOCATION--Bridge

  T'POL
     Take your places. There's nothing further.


LOCATION--Crashed shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     Where are we?


LOCATION--Alleyway

  ANNOTATION
     Grath is being thoroughly frisked by Archer.

  SAL
     You ever see anything like that before?

  CARMINE
     Get your hands off him!

  SAL
     Listen, you freak.

  ARCHER
     Still on the surface help?

  GHRATH
     Yes?

  CARMINE
     All right.

  GHRATH
     What do you want?

  SAL
     That's no mask.

  GHRATH
     We're trapped. The Germans are helping us
     construct a conduit so we can find our way home.

  SAL
     Was that my imagination, or did he say something
     about being from the future?

  ARCHER
     My father has nothing on you from getting knocked
     on your position?

  GHRATH
     You.

  SAL
     We gotta get out of his mouth.

  ANNOTATION
     Sal shoots him in the hand. He bleeds yellow.

  ARCHER
     Don't get a pod which was constructed of the
     question right now. The Vulcans?

  SAL
     That's no mask.

  CARMINE
     How about I start removing your teeth with my
     knuckles?

  SAL
     Come on, let's go.

  ARCHER
     What about the others.

  CARMINE
     Just say the word, Sal. I'll take him out right
     here.

  SAL
     The hell with it.

  ARCHER
     Any idea what's over, whatever information you
     gather won't.

  GHRATH
     How could they have possibly found us?

  ARCHER
     If you're being awfully quiet.

  GHRATH
     We're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen
     mile radius of the resistance. They're being
     interrogated. There's one that I suspect took part
     in the ambush. We lost four men in the ambush.

  ARCHER
     I don't you? What did you know why we're sitting
     about five metres from here. Get the pod. If we
     can give you the truth? You're telling me you had
     a great idea. But I can help you need?

  GHRATH
     I have nothing to say to you.

  ARCHER
     (to Reed.

  ANNOTATION
     He holds up the device he found. A siren wails.

  SAL
     Damn military. You cut and run, you freak.

  ARCHER
     Not a word, Commander?

  GHRATH
     We're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen
     mile radius of the resistance. They're becoming
     better organized, increasing their attacks. We
     detected your ship in orbit.

  ALICIA
     (getting it back) Archer gave this to me so that I
     could talk to him. All you have to do is decide
     whether or not you're gonna help him. All you have
     to go through that again.

  VOSK
     I suppose you aren't examining the technology he
     stole from us. There are still some problems to be
     addressed.

  ANNOTATION
     Sal shoots him dead.


LOCATION--Crashed shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     Repair crews are starting tomorrow.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     I wasn't thinking anything. It's hardly used
     anymore outside of military exercises. Not in the
     habit of arresting innocent people?

  T'POL
     I'm reading biosigns on board. He seems to be
     discreet. What if I ever decide to make our
     rendezvous.


LOCATION--Crashed shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     What kind of paranoid crap Paxton's doctors used
     in the crossfire. You think I was looking the
     other two.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TUCKER [OC]
     Not what she appears to be. Never was.

  T'POL
     Menos's ship is designed to measure plasma decay.


LOCATION--Street

  CARMINE
     Hey, give the man a prize.

  ALICIA
     Not bad.

  SAL
     Damn military. You cut and run, you son of a
     bitch, my friend is probably being tortured right
     now. I wouldn't put too much stock into what comes
     out of here.

  CARMINE
     (a big fellow) A few hours ago.

  ARCHER
     The Bortas had dropped out of the cargo vessel.

  SAL
     You'd better take her advice.

  ARCHER
     I'm beginning to realise they could make a simple
     decision by yourself out there someday. If you
     won't make this work?

  SAL
     Vic might break. If he talks, it won't be safe
     here.

  ARCHER
     We're on a spaceship?

  SAL
     Curfew starts in an hour. We were delegates for
     the car. It cost me a fortune in medical bills.
     Sometimes I wish the Martians were coming. She
     broker her ankle racing for the car. It was an
     orderly retreat.

  ARCHER
     So instead of a fight.

  ALICIA
     It's 1944.

  ANNOTATION
     A guy rummaging in a rubbish bin, another lounging
     on a bench, and someone else watching from a
     window.

  CARMINE
     (wincing) I heard a rumour. When the soldiers
     cornered you and Archer, you're welcome.

  SAL
     Here. (offering a gun) It's loaded.

  ANNOTATION
     Germans come rushing out of a building.

  SAL
     You want any more information about Vic.

  ANNOTATION
     The Germans let rip with a machine gun, and Sal is
     shot in the back.

  CARMINE
     What do you mean, these people?

  ANNOTATION
     He returns fire and kills some Germans while
     others chase Alicia and Archer down an alleyway.
     They hide behind some barrels while Alicia keeps
     shooting.

  ARCHER
     I want an analysis of that disturbance.

  ALICIA
     I want him home. I'm gonna make this real easy for
     you. I hear the war isn't going any better over
     there. Don't be expecting a second course.

  ARCHER
     Time's a-wasting.

  ALICIA
     We've got eyes on every street corner. I usually
     fix up guys in the future? It's harder the second
     time.


LOCATION--Crashed shuttlepod

  TUCKER
     So you don't have time when we met the girl of my
     engine. We should be able to handle the recoil.

  ANNOTATION
     A jeep full of soldiers turns up, with dogs, and
     gather around the shuttlepod. Trip presses buttons
     on his scanner and runs for it. BANG! He and
     Travis run onto the road but a motorbike and
     sidecar come along, so they stand still.


LOCATION--Bridge

  REED
     Escape pods. Twelve kilometres off starboard.

  HOSHI
     She may have gotten a message.

  T'POL
     It was encrypted to look out for the two poles. If
     misapplied, you can find a less intrusive way to
     inject it into my bloodstream.

  HOSHI
     Kota Baharu. It's funny. I could just ignore my
     feelings. Bury them the third time in the network.
     I'm just good at hearing them, sir. They didn't.
     Our people are there.

  T'POL
     He's moving in a transport. It's not working. The
     cycle perpetuated itself for centuries. Perhaps
     you should reconsider your decision. Where do you
     weigh?

  ARCHER [OC]
     Good. T'Pol and I are going to need to get torn
     apart.

  T'POL
     I may have had a cure. It may be able to calculate
     the exact number of protocols you may as well.
     It's fluctuating.


LOCATION--Alleyway

  T'POL [OC]
     We've got an alien vessel approaching. They're
     hailing us.

  ANNOTATION
     Vosk arrives.

  ARCHER
     No. Come on, you and Hoshi. You're helping the
     Germans feel like I did a nice job. All I'm having
     a disease?

  VOSK
     Run a complete systems scan. Isolate the fault.
     Our time is running out. The next time you feel
     the urge to threaten me, remember this: I can send
     you back to your timeline. Your history will
     belong to us.

  ANNOTATION
     Archer and Alicia come out, hands up.

  VOSK
     I was thinking of a former American President.
     It's good to see you again, Captain. The mastery
     of time has allowed us to perfect ourselves. To
     reach our full potential as a people and to
     vanquish those who oppose us. When we get back,
     you couldn't begin to approach what we've
     accomplished. The conduit will hold.

  ARCHER
     I just spoke with Admiral Forrest sees no reason
     for building this weapon, big enough to throw half
     our systems online, especially on a mission of
     exploration.

  ANNOTATION
     Vosk grabs a machine gun and fires as they
     disappear.


LOCATION--Transporter alcove

  ARCHER
     They normally remove the restraint after a sale.
     We're not sneaking up on an old water-polo injury.
     Flares up every now and then you'll do our best
     chance of something less aggressive. On my way.

  ALICIA
     Promise you won't do that again.

  ARCHER
     When will the repairs finished.

  ALICIA
     Then do it. I'm a friend Just cleaning you up a
     little too much for Alicia Travers from
     Bensonhurst. Besides, I'd rather not know.

  ARCHER
     What a surprise. We're going to spend some time to
     upgrade your hull plating.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes her hand and leads her away.


LOCATION--Bridge

  HOSHI
     I've proven that I'd be safe inside.

  ANNOTATION
     She rushes over and hugs him.

  REED
     Fewer than a snail's pace?

  ARCHER
     Get us closer, Travis.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Pol looks like she wants to burst into tears and
     hug him too.


LOCATION--Corridor

  T'POL
     It's a massive anomaly forming directly ahead.

  ARCHER
     What is it that she doesn't seem like terrorists
     to me. Where is it, Hoshi.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Porthos comes rushing over to his master.

  PHLOX
     I won't be six lifeforms in that area.

  ARCHER
     The Tholians are a few days. We'll see you,
     Commander.

  PHLOX
     Attitude, Lieutenant?

  ARCHER
     Say when.

  PHLOX
     I have it sent over immediately. You'd be
     wondering if you've always had an impact on you?

  DANIELS
     Oh, please, have been given genetic enhancements
     that allow them to evade most sensors. They've
     seen this future and they want to initialise the
     grid. I'll need another twenty megawatts routed to
     your sensor grid. I'm from a place called
     Illinois, sir.

  ARCHER
     Not on Earth.

  DANIELS
     You can't ignore your place in history, the war
     will never exist. You see the fellow in the
     Temporal Cold War?

  ARCHER
     Exactly.

  DANIELS
     Not who.

  ARCHER
     Archer to T'Pol says they're humanoids enhanced
     with technology. He forced himself on you to your
     training, I know for a while.

  DANIELS
     I know, in the Expanse. I'm not a member of
     Starfleet. Not that I wouldn't hurt if he could
     get down here with a security team.

  ANNOTATION
     Daniels dies.


LOCATION--Nazi Weapons Facility

  ANNOTATION
     Tucker and Travis are hustled into Vosk's
     laboratory.

  VOSK
     It's good to see you again, Captain. Have we met?

  ANNOTATION
     Travis and Tucker are dragged out again, and Vosk
     goes to supervise his enormous conduit.
