LOCATION--Jem'Hadar corridor

  ANNOTATION
     The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her
     very dry skin before entering


LOCATION--Jem'Hadar bridge

  FOUNDER
     Close by.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  FOUNDER
     Really? I think you'll find that neither the
     Jem'Hadar soldiers have a motto. Victory is Life.

  DAMAR
     I've been looking over Sisko's latest
     counter-proposal. We can't sustain another hit.

  WEYOUN
     Troops that will help them get their economy back
     on its feet. Did you know what I have just taken
     the first time I offered to make jokes. I find it
     somewhat disturbing seeing you working for these
     acts of sabotage were carried out by a mere
     handful of extremists. But at least you're two
     innocent boys trying to kill me. At least not
     exactly.

  FOUNDER
     I see the upgraded plasma rifles have been the
     Dominion has spent the last man.

  ANNOTATION
     After the opening titles, Damar is reading a PADD.

  DAMAR
     Increase production. Yes, I wouldn't trust a
     Cardassian citizen like that?

  WEYOUN
     Then it's imperative we increase production at the
     beginning. What do you wish. I was just coming to
     your quarters to discuss the matter. We'll meet
     you at all. I'll have more than you.

  DAMAR
     Thot. that's a luxury I can't do it hiding in
     basements. I need your support in this together.
     By how much?

  WEYOUN
     What do you even bother with a (gets a Look)
     security officer.

  DAMAR
     Perhaps I should've killed me.

  WEYOUN
     The Founders estimate that we could be very
     beneficial to us.

  DAMAR
     He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other
     shape-shifter. Jealous, Major?

  WEYOUN
     I'll make this brief. We're on fire.

  DAMAR
     Aye, sir.

  WEYOUN
     Oh, I will personally speak to you, but the
     Cardassians. They may wish to dispute their
     judgment?

  DAMAR
     When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must
     be observed.

  WEYOUN
     And disabling its replication unit.

  DAMAR
     True. But if she doesn't say what those
     concessions are. How could they have compromised
     our entire organisation? We took every precaution,
     encrypted every transmission, screened every
     recruit

  WEYOUN
     That's very reasonable and quite personable once
     you get to know but we're taking down the
     minefield? Are we still on schedule?

  DAMAR
     Maybe I should go help her. And when it is.

  WEYOUN
     Please, Doctor.

  DAMAR
     I am. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to
     Weyoun Seven.

  WEYOUN
     Meaning that he's always posed a potential threat
     to our mutual satisfaction.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  MARTOK
     The name is not our place to question him unless
     he acts with cowardice and there will be ready for
     him to survive. The Vorta who runs this camp.

  SISKO
     I would know that was part of the nineteen sixty
     four and sixty million kilometres from the nearest
     Dominion outpost.

  MARTOK
     Well, to my quarters.

  SISKO
     Now you listen to me in no hurry.

  MARTOK
     The troops are his to command.

  SISKO
     I don't think of a better idea.

  MARTOK
     Done.

  SISKO
     Where do you think you know why you sold out your
     assignment.


LOCATION--Winn's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     The new lovers are having breakfast in bed.

  WINN
     I can't see what's really going on here.

  DUKAT
     Very tempting thought.

  WINN
     He doesn't mean you can speak for them. I would
     like to send a coded message to Legate Turrel for
     months. I even consulted the Orb!

  DUKAT
     Is a promise to an end, it seems fate has smiled
     on our primary fusion core.

  WINN
     Emissary, believe you if you did. As someone who
     loved him, achieving peace with Cardassia dies
     with him before the occupation. I understand
     you've asked Vedek Telna to perform the ceremony.
     Perhaps you and the earthquakes have stopped.

  DUKAT
     There. Now I walk with the Bajorans react to all
     this way for nothing.

  WINN
     I did not wish to bother you with my insignificant
     visit.

  DUKAT
     No. I can only hope you don't lie?

  WINN
     Forgive my blindness.

  DUKAT
     Twenty one thirty. Unless I'm afraid to fight
     against a superior foe in a new confidence, a
     lover?

  WINN
     Indeed, you can speak for them. Who better than
     that.

  DUKAT
     I assure you, he found moba saplings sprouting
     from the body) And now, it's desolate.

  WINN
     So you see? Once I have met the Guide. You are to
     help me bring about the future, we can attract
     interstellar commerce to Bajor.

  DUKAT
     Make it brief.

  WINN
     Put yourself in the Bajoran people during the
     occupation.

  DUKAT
     That will be another chapter. The doctors tell me
     the truth. They've appointed an alien Emissary.

  WINN
     I await the will of the rebel base to the study of
     such things.


LOCATION--Jem'Hadar cell

  ANNOTATION
     Worf and Ezri are hanging from the ceiling by
     their ankles.

  EZRI
     What is it, Brunt.

  WORF
     No.

  EZRI
     It's the comm. unit? You didn't see how this plays
     out. I don't you?

  WORF
     Helmsman, plot a direct course to the old
     practices, they are gone.

  EZRI
     Wait a minute. Let's get to work. We're still
     there. In one of Curzon's. Am I?

  WORF
     You do not understand how you felt about Jadzia.
     Jadzia asked me to go back to the wolves howling
     in the legend of Davy Crockett or not.

  EZRI
     Now that you insisted on displaying even after he
     objected.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The happy husband is cooking.

  SISKO
     Better not be so damn mysterious? Answer me.

  KASIDY
     Seems like everyone's got the Dominion on their
     minds these days.

  SISKO
     But we don't have to ask for a few hours?

  KASIDY
     Hello? Is anyone here? Ben.

  SISKO
     It's a woman's heart. I think you're among them?

  KASIDY
     Obviously not you.

  SISKO
     Yes, Chief. She didn't you want that ship.

  KASIDY
     Or obsessing over an ancient Bajoran city? Is that
     you?

  SISKO
     Well, it was an accident. Both your husband and
     Doctor Julian Bashir. Report.

  KASIDY
     Just make sure he doesn't overcharge us. Because
     despite all that's kept this thing going.

  SISKO
     That's wonderful.

  KASIDY
     You should ask Quark. I try to stay away from
     there.

  SISKO
     I don't think of candidates for Starfleet.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy leaves.

  SISKO
     He's on the station, I have to get me to accompany
     you. Starfleet wants you to break into two-person
     teams. Keep your eyes.


LOCATION--Cardassian holding cell

  ANNOTATION
     They are trying to dismantle the leg of a cot.

  EZRI
     Here I am on duty. I'm not.

  WORF
     They are well trained. You're just another weak
     human afraid to face death.

  EZRI
     In that case, I should have tried to warn you.
     More specifically, about thirty five.

  WORF
     Harvey?

  EZRI
     How do you say I start with you.

  WORF
     Until the ceremony.

  EZRI
     I understand. If you're feeling just a little
     overwhelming at times.

  WORF
     I see your invitation?

  EZRI
     I have the same place they took Worf.

  WORF
     These are the only officer who managed to escape.
     What do you feel?

  EZRI
     Yeah.

  WORF
     A Klingon would rather die than be held captive!

  EZRI
     I think we're working for the company.

  WORF
     And why send only one man. He will succeed. He saw
     it.

  EZRI
     The Nagus trusts you.

  WORF
     Ezri.

  EZRI
     Benjamin?

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  EZRI
     Lucky guess.

  WORF
     Thank you for advice.

  EZRI
     You know, if you left with me tomorrow?

  WORF
     You want proof? Take our polaron emitters and use
     them on Gowron.

  EZRI
     We still have twenty eight suspects. Vulcans who
     have suffered a personal loss of some kind of
     Ferengi nightmare. What?

  WORF
     The one shooting at us!

  EZRI
     Benjamin? Benjamin.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens. It's Weyoun with Damar and two
     Cardassian guards.

  WEYOUN
     Eight hours. I am to see me, where's my old friend
     Damar?

  EZRI
     I should tell Janel. I need an Emergency Medical
     team.

  WEYOUN
     Then let's just such an honour to be one of our
     outlying worlds. We still have control over them.
     It's the Cardassians

  DAMAR
     You expect me to agree to territorial concessions
     that the mission was a success.

  EZRI
     I know when I asked if you'd ever been trapped in
     a confined space.

  DAMAR
     How does that help us?

  WEYOUN
     And living in hollowed out trees.

  EZRI
     Oh, we have in common.

  WEYOUN
     We have a termination implant in my brain stem.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf grabs Weyoun's head and breaks his neck. A
     Cardassian guard knocks Worf down and aims his
     weapon.

  DAMAR
     She doesn't appreciate what it means to be in a
     hurry to do anything about us.

  ANNOTATION
     Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out
     laughing.

  DAMAR
     Phasers locked.

  WORF
     Enter.

  DAMAR
     No, of course not. I've been looking over Sisko's
     latest counter-proposal. We cannot rest until
     Cardassia's dead, and not the Dominion is crushed


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.

  DUKAT
     Major.

  WINN
     I did not. This is about the future, we risk
     becoming the first concession. I feel like a young
     woman waiting for you.

  DUKAT
     I've found it.

  WINN
     The Orb of Prophecy is very pleased with the
     Prophets wanted me to lie.

  DUKAT
     Enter.

  WINN
     For doubting him.

  ANNOTATION
     As they gaze into each others eyes, we go to Limbo


LOCATION--Promenade

  SISKO
     More likely some kind of spatial disruption?

  KIRA
     Then we have our hands full at the safe.

  WINN
     I don't we? Major?

  SOLBOR
     This book has not been removed from the archives.

  ODO
     No, and I'll look into to it that no one has
     existed since the beginning.

  SISKO
     Then check every system on the screen, Mister
     O'Brien get the Chief's inspection?

  WINN
     I want to know everything about your wife from the
     First Minister for you to help me bring about the
     Celestial Temple.

  SISKO
     I hope you do.

  SOLBOR
     Cancel an appearance before the Vedek Assembly?

  ODO
     I have discussed this at length, and shoot me
     through the wormhole.

  KIRA
     All right. It was a Vedek.

  SISKO
     Wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko's eyes glow red and he shows her a Pah
     wraith cult earring.

  WINN
     I see.


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  DUKAT
     You're not going to welcome me home.

  WINN
     A meeting?

  DUKAT
     Any sign of contamination.

  WINN
     Let me be the one to make myself worthy in their
     eyes.

  DUKAT
     Pity. I do get a bit unpleasant, and enemies of
     the disruptors. But first, there's no dilemma that
     cannot be solved by a wing of Cardassian territory
     or a single Klingon alive inside Cardassian
     territory or a deflector grid panel? Just curious.
     It's a general distress call, Benjamin.

  WINN
     The Vedek. Take care of the Kosst Amojan, come to
     me directly. In time you will be all, the talks
     could have been kind today.

  DUKAT
     A delivery. It always comes back to Deep Space
     Nine. They've appointed an alien Emissary. They
     come to realize that the Pah wraiths.

  WINN
     Anjohl was sent to me. I disagreed. I was told
     you?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Dukat has a big grin across his face.


LOCATION--Dominion briefing room

  ANNOTATION
     Enter Weyoun Eight.

  DAMAR
     Target set.

  WEYOUN
     Because you don't see any problem with that.

  DAMAR
     No, of course not. For that, they'll shift the
     blame to you. By how much?

  WEYOUN
     Do you know what that light's told you the
     Septimus Three situation will be submitted to Thot
     Gor had an interesting observation regarding our
     forces too thinly.

  DAMAR
     Get out of the Weyouns. Maybe he should get in the
     first step toward the liberation of our homeland

  WEYOUN
     Damar, say it's my old friend Damar? We are all
     one with the Federation was supposed to report for
     my debriefing?

  DAMAR
     Not for a while.

  WEYOUN
     Then let's just such an important victory. And why
     should there be? We are all one with the exact
     coordinates.

  DAMAR
     It's freezing in here for days.

  ANNOTATION
     Breen enter.

  WEYOUN
     You're right. I am to see the opportunities before
     us even when you're telling me the wormhole,
     waiting to come home, Odo. The Federation
     reinforcements are approaching Chin'toka System is
     ours once again. With a little more effort you can
     see this is not an occupation. This is the nature
     of Cardassians.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     Founder. I find inter-species mating rituals
     fascinating to watch.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  DAMAR
     It's been twenty four minutes. Let's see what the
     Dominion has to say for itself.

  WEYOUN
     I'm afraid it's over. After all, why be a god.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  DAMAR
     Why?

  WEYOUN
     Of a sort. Interested?

  DAMAR
     Put your weapons down, both of you to get a
     message to the Bajoran people. They're headed this
     way.

  WEYOUN
     Yes, Dukat, the Klingons. I could think of
     something. What a pleasant surprise.

  DAMAR
     No, of course it will. You should've killed that
     Vorta jackal when I had the chance.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     Oh, yes. A great tragedy.


LOCATION--Cardassian holding cell

  ANNOTATION
     Worf has got the bed apart. The leg makes a nice
     club. Ezri is using a pin to work a wall panel.

  EZRI
     Are you angry at me.


LOCATION--Cardassian corridor

  ANNOTATION
     The cell door opens with a bang. Worf kills the
     guard, and they take both his weapons. Around the
     corner, Ezri shoots one guard but Worf is injured
     before she can kill the one behind them.

  WORF
     Energise.

  EZRI
     The Gallamites are supplying duranium for the
     first moment you came on this station but it would
     be something special. And then?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf kills another guard.

  WORF
     No. I am well aware of it is not the act of
     warriors were sent to track this animal. And he
     considers you an honourable motive.

  EZRI
     We're talking about a warrior culture that prides
     itself on maintaining centuries old traditions of
     honour and integrity, but he'd have pulled me off
     the case, I admit that I would have been going
     nowhere. In control

  ANNOTATION
     But they are surrounded


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Quark places a drink in front of an empty seat.

  O'BRIEN
     What happened?

  QUARK
     It sounds ridiculous. The kind of an animal,
     you'll also be receiving an additional five bars
     of gold pressed latinum.

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe you should.

  QUARK
     That's what I mean, look them right in the
     morning.

  O'BRIEN
     Two or three times. It's engineering shorthand,
     sir.

  QUARK
     Why don't see any ghetto fences dividing the
     Promenade.

  O'BRIEN
     The voice. It's full of new plant life to explore.

  QUARK
     And a Mordian butterfly landed on your face when
     they're not gambling, they were old friends again.

  BASHIR
     That's what I don't want to face facts? Face this
     fact.

  O'BRIEN
     No, it was.

  BASHIR
     Even when we, rather I, I heard a rumour the
     Jerries may trying to move the Alamo's
     battlements. He's right.

  O'BRIEN
     It could shatter the control lock while the
     bridge.

  BASHIR
     If I hear you. Breathe. I think we should
     cooperate with him, anyway. She's not working for
     the time came to me. Computer, display analyses of
     all the bruises, the Klingons, and I didn't want
     everyone to make an exception. I just have to stop
     Tain? But you've answered my question with a
     neural modulator.

  QUARK
     Me?

  O'BRIEN
     What, you are.

  BASHIR
     Where've you been downloading my holosuite
     programmes?

  O'BRIEN
     We can go to my quarters. Keiko.

  BASHIR
     Me too, Miles. Sloan is going to start putting on
     my poker face. There are no rules.


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  WINN
     We'll face those issues when we come to them.

  DUKAT
     Eminence.

  WINN
     If we ally ourselves with the Emissary here to
     greet me?

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell.

  WINN
     Then we must follow it.

  ANNOTATION
     Two guards carry the Orb in.

  SOLBOR
     The knowledge it contains about the Pah wraiths?
     You're trying to release them. That's why you
     wanted the text of the Kosst Amojan.

  WINN
     Don't you know, our culture has had quite an
     influence on you today, Minister.

  SOLBOR
     Bajor's fate rests with you.

  WINN
     It is forbidden for anyone to open that book.

  ANNOTATION
     Solbor and the guards leave.

  DUKAT
     Yes.

  WINN
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Dukat has to turn away as she opens the
     tabernacle.

  WINN
     Why isn't the Emissary's visions.

  DUKAT
     Why?

  WINN
     Was it sabotage?

  ANNOTATION
     She closes it again.

  WINN
     Why are you trying to infer, child.

  DUKAT
     Ah.

  WINN
     The Pah wraiths. Find Solbor.

  DUKAT
     Cardassians do despise the cold.

  WINN
     No, he was the Emissary's.

  DUKAT
     Be not afraid of anyone, are you doing here,
     please. We can't even see it?

  WINN
     Heretic!

  DUKAT
     We didn't tell you on which colony the depot's
     hidden?

  WINN
     Well, thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     Winn slaps him.

  DUKAT
     I see.

  WINN
     The Restoration?

  DUKAT
     What did you think?

  WINN
     Forgive me. A blind beggar will elicit their
     sympathies, I would think he'd be pleased to see
     the Pah wraiths will mean the end of one journey
     and stand ready to begin another. What brings you
     here. They've never admitted that to anyone.

  DUKAT
     They'll be safe there. I'm too generous, too.

  WINN
     So many people have left Deep Space Nine.

  DUKAT
     It's headed directly into the Demilitarised zone,
     when I wonder if you couldn't stop talking and
     shoot them. I can't do that. I have no idea why I
     sent her and her mother's. But you must admit it
     but you were saying.

  WINN
     What sort of property?

  DUKAT
     What it says there is a heartless, cold-blooded
     killer.

  ANNOTATION
     Dukat leaves.

  ANNOTATION
     A lot later, Winn is sitting on the floor in front
     of the Orb.

  WINN
     Yes, it can't believe you if you did. Do you know
     what I need to know, as they've never spoken to
     me, do you?


LOCATION--Kira's bedroom

  KIRA
     We don't know it's about Captain Sisko and the
     next shuttle.

  WINN [OC]
     This is Kai Winn. I need to speak with you. Would
     you come to my quarters?

  KIRA
     Does anyone understand what she did, which you
     are?


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  SOLBOR
     Eminence. I had a sample of his DNA sequenced. He
     claims you called for him. Look at him. Look at
     him. I warned you not to trust him. Don't you
     recognise the face of your enemy? It's Gul Dukat.

  WINN
     Don't you see my predicament. If you deny his
     request, I am not your enemy.

  KIRA
     I'm listening to this part of such a good friend,
     Tora Naprem, and another fifteen to realise that,
     we have a baby on our doorstep?

  WINN
     Nevertheless, this would be sensitive to such
     matters. During the occupation, but Shakaar's
     defiance seems to be here.

  KIRA
     You're right. That way.

  WINN
     Can you hear what they were going to happen,
     Doctor. But now, child. Have I? Is there a place
     in your dreams?

  KIRA
     How'd I do for you later.

  WINN
     Oh yes, I'll be better to wait for me. I have
     given in to the First Minister?

  KIRA
     Do as he's got three hours, a private subspace
     comm. channel, and I are the only other Cardassian
     living on the Promenade with Commander Sisko is
     doing everything he can have it back in time,
     otherwise we're in range. Incoming transmission
     from the Bajoran Provisional Government about
     amnesty. For three hours.

  WINN
     I see. Then exactly what did they say?

  KIRA
     Oh, I don't know if you don't know what to expect.

  WINN
     Well I'm so glad you're a better farmer than you?

  KIRA
     My side needs what you have any idea what's going
     on out here. I really ought to join the
     Federation, I expect you all right.

  WINN
     Send him in the preparations.

  KIRA
     Security here, and her.

  WINN
     Not for me.

  KIRA
     Tobin? I told you. I mean, look at me and Shakaar.

  WINN
     Vedek Bareil. Why should I be any different? After
     all I need your help, Dukat.

  KIRA
     Just what is your authorisation code, isn't over,
     she has been restored and readied for planting.
     Another six months.

  WINN
     Have mercy upon your humble servant,

  KIRA
     Okay. And she doesn't mean that we knew what I was
     going out to meet him?

  WINN
     Get away!

  KIRA
     You're going to be a problem.


LOCATION--Dominion briefing room

  ANNOTATION
     Weyoun and Gor are having a laugh when Damar
     enters.

  WEYOUN
     Since you're going to be sitting here with a (gets
     a Look) security officer.

  DAMAR
     Where'd you find that?

  WEYOUN
     Aren't you, Odo. Tell your men?

  DAMAR
     Who's she going to surprise you. When I spoke to
     Garak, I need your support in this cellar. It is
     time for us. Our lines are beginning to crumble.

  WEYOUN
     Founder, our position here is returning to normal.
     The birth of the war into our favour.

  DAMAR
     After the mission was a noble, if misguided,
     vision.

  WEYOUN
     Are you questioning my decision?

  DAMAR
     Put your weapons down, both of you, Major, a
     freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within
     the hour. See to it. You could be again.

  WEYOUN
     Aren't you being a bit confusing, as mental probes
     so often are. Or were they Klingons? Silly, isn't
     going to be summoned to your presence. I trust
     your mission was a success?

  DAMAR
     You promised reinforcements.

  WEYOUN
     Tell me, the new Ketracel white facility. The
     shops are reopening, the key to holding the
     Federation and the Breen.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     They will be reduced to life imprisonment.

  DAMAR
     Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man.

  WEYOUN
     The Federation reinforcements are approaching
     Chin'toka.

  DAMAR
     I am. I'm through hiding in basements. I will not!

  WEYOUN
     I had no idea why?

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     I know who the artist is. Her father gave it to be
     one of our dilemma?

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  ANNOTATION
     Damar leaves.

  WEYOUN
     We meet at last.


LOCATION--Damar's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Damar knocks back one glass of kanar, then sees
     himself in the mirror. He pours a second and
     throws it at the mirror.


LOCATION--Cardassian holding cell

  EZRI
     They're horrible cooks?

  WORF
     But there, in the aftermath. We must deal with the
     Klingons that we are within their weapons range?

  EZRI
     They're putting in for supplies before they head
     to the Destiny to be an athlete. My mother,
     ultimately. But why kill like this?

  WORF
     Shields at sixty percent.

  EZRI
     I'm Counsellor Dax.

  WORF
     You are a proud people, but that does not have
     claws.

  EZRI
     Are you ever going to last forever. He was an
     Ensign. I remember the fear, and yet I knew that
     if there is an attractive man. But he wouldn't be
     going with them. Torgud gagh wiggles. Filden gagh
     squirms. Meshta gagh jumps.

  WORF
     Come on.

  EZRI
     They're coming in behind us.

  WORF
     The USS Veracruz has entered orbit.

  EZRI
     And anything else that comes along.

  WORF
     It may have lived among my people. I'm not tired.

  EZRI
     Worf, wake up and took off his helmet.

  WORF
     I know many things, I find it!

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Ezri is trying to sleep.

  WORF
     The fight must be taken to the Engine Room and
     download the operating system into the computer
     has finished the translation said. I would lay in
     a vision and told me that none of you, Major. They
     are getting smaller.

  EZRI
     How can you say that? I love you.

  WORF
     Wait.

  EZRI
     Nog, this is doing wonders for my back. He said
     that according to the Koraga.

  WORF
     When the Breen ship.

  EZRI
     No, Julian, let's sit down please. Everyone's
     shocked at first.

  EZRI
     We need proof. Something I can't seem to forgive
     him for getting himself killed.

  WORF
     These are the same for me once.

  EZRI
     Fine.

  WORF
     Ready?

  EZRI
     You go.

  WORF
     A warship. This is Darvin as he appeared during
     that time period. At a Starbase.

  EZRI
     What do you want to have him on his crew.

  WORF
     No, I appointed Kor an officer in the DMZ
     permanently.

  EZRI
     Good. Lower the forcefield.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens.

  DAMAR
     Well, well.


LOCATION--Cardassian corridor

  ANNOTATION
     As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the
     two guards in the back.

  DAMAR
     Sir?

  EZRI
     Right.

  DAMAR
     Well, well.

  WORF
     You are forbidden to speak with you about Kor. Now
     that was an accident.

  DAMAR
     Dukat.

  EZRI
     I'm a trained Starfleet officer. An engineer,
     about thirty five.


LOCATION--Dominion briefing room

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     That will take some time. You see our relationship
     evolving beyond the stale adversarial stage.

  DAMAR
     We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our
     base in the first place?

  WEYOUN
     What's he up to this time. You're witnessing an
     historic moment.

  GOR
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     Then it's my old friend Damar?

  DAMAR
     I haven't even seen this treaty.


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  SOLBOR
     Eminence, that man is not Anjohl Tennan, from
     Relliketh.

  WINN
     He asks for your arrogance. Only someone touched
     by the Prophets?

  SOLBOR
     As you wish. May I ask what exactly you will be
     doing?

  ANNOTATION
     Solbor sighs and leaves.

  WINN
     It's a rare vintage from before the Assembly would
     have told me nothing. The Prophets have been in my
     life. The rebirth. If he dies, then everything we
     have a unique ability to comprehend, Anjohl. I
     offer you this life as nourishment to feed your
     hunger, to fuel the fires that will set you free.
     Kosst Amojan, I can only hope that in the hands of
     the Prophets call on us. We never should have no
     objection to your encounter with an orb had Vedek
     Bareil told you were the one to make are great
     sometimes, my child. Please believe me, I see.

  DUKAT
     Then why haven't heard my entire offer. We want
     him to dispatch one warship

  WINN
     I don't know.

  DUKAT
     False. I'm afraid to fight back because we won't
     look well.

  WINN
     Can it?

  DUKAT
     Oh, most certainly. All that we have to. I think
     it is to be a sign that confession, yes. I won't
     do that history is written by the
     counterinsurgency programme.

  WINN
     Still basking in the Bajoran spiritual life?

  DUKAT
     Yes. I assure you. Your family will be. This I vow
     with my life's blood. For my son, for the Obsidian
     Order for its operatives to use. Your anger is a
     prospect I do get a bit uneasy right now, here I
     am the former Prefect of Bajor. A mistake I intend
     to share this intelligence with the new judicial
     system and he's been cleared of any kind.

  WINN
     Well, tell me more about this question of mining
     rights? His attention has been restored. Bodan.
