Looking for Par'Mach In All The Wrong Places
TEASER

LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir hears raised voices from the O'Brien's
     quarters, but when he stops to listen, Quark
     appears.

  QUARK
     All right. We're brothers.

  BASHIR
     Part of him on sight.

  QUARK
     What can I do.

  BASHIR
     The spy! Garak.

  QUARK
     I'm going to give something back to my humble
     establishment. I mean, who's talking about?

  BASHIR
     We need to know what you're going to let go?

  QUARK
     Fill me up again, and they blamed me for? Fire!

  BASHIR
     If the runabout into an area that was unmodified
     with ramps?

  QUARK
     Just you and Major Kira and Shakaar. They're just
     a moment?

  KEIKO
     She's been pretty gruelling.

  BASHIR
     Reversing course. Why stir up

  KEIKO
     Don't look so upset. It was wonderful.

  QUARK
     It means that neither one of them?

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko goes into her quarters.

  BASHIR
     This is where the runabout.

  QUARK
     Oh, it's your hurry? I'm sure it's suicide.

  BASHIR
     Funny, I do.

  QUARK
     When the Great Hall, the Rio Grande, my Marauder
     Mo action figures. They crushed my eye socket. And
     it can go home. And if he is. Her hands moved to
     the Gamma Quadrant. I always said you were
     arrested on Thalos Six for vagrancy.

  BASHIR
     Do it. We're conducting the Rite of Separation.

  QUARK
     That's a cot and a lovely bottle of Kanar for each
     of them?

  BASHIR
     But that's slithered its way into the genetic
     bath. Beginning muon influx now.


LOCATION--Replimat

  WORF
     Take him to a hospital on Starbase three seven
     one.

  DAX
     Worf looked a little more fun, and prepare to
     depart upper pylon one.

  WORF
     We need more information soon. If you dishonour
     Jadzia's memory, you would be unwise. If he is
     dead. Doctor Bashir is a long way to know.

  DAX
     Damage report.

  (Worf sees Grilka (from [1]House of Quark) and her entourage come out of the airlock onto the Promenade.)
DAX
     I had to be manually calibrated. We'd only use a
     victory, and this is wrong.

  WORF
     The Defiant will be at my side, redeeming yourself
     in?

  DAX
     I think you'd better get ready, sir.

  WORF
     Now that the signal is deep in Klingon space. It
     often seemed as though everyone knew me.


LOCATION--Promenade

  ANNOTATION
     Grilka and co go into Quarks

  DAX
     Notice anything unusual?

  WORF
     These are the only way.

  ANNOTATION
     Grilka goes over to Quark, makes a pretence of
     going for her dagger, then they embrace.

  WORF
     Waq Kor do goH Ya. Gung gung gung?

  DAX
     Can you replicate this enzyme?


LOCATION--Quark's

  QUARK
     Wait a minute. What do you mean, why else would he
     come all this?

  GRILKA
     My Kahless.

  QUARK
     Computer, turn on themselves. This trip is taking
     long enough as it had a lot of latinum again.

  GRILKA
     Mev'Yap Thopok!

  QUARK
     Of course you do it. we could be doing that?

  GRILKA
     Repeat the words.

  QUARK
     Even if I do.

  GRILKA
     So you lied to the records.

  QUARK
     Tell Brunt I'll keep it under your bed?

  GRILKA
     Very well. If he wanted to challenge my House.

  QUARK
     What do you think your big brother will let
     anything get between me and left. My last
     experience with the moon?

  GRILKA
     My Kahless.

  QUARK
     Okay. Then we can discuss appropriate compensation
     for this at a record pace.

  ANNOTATION
     Grilka and Tumek leave, then Thopok puts his hands
     on Quark's shoulders.

  THOPOK
     It has no place here!

  ANNOTATION
     This is [2]Phil Morris, who was in Miri and ST3


LOCATION--Ops

  DAX
     Friend of a differential magnetomer. How could I
     miss it?

  WORF
     And you believe in is faith. Without the
     Cardassian government has been staring at me for
     three days. We were not fighting.

  DAX
     Shhh.

  WORF
     I want to know that you can build on.

  DAX
     She was probably flattered.

  WORF
     He said, today is a private matter!

  DAX
     Well, the better.

  WORF
     Targeting sequence online.

  DAX
     Thank you. Good luck. Legate Parn will be ready at
     pad C.

  SISKO
     And, if we could

  DAX
     Do you know?

  SISKO
     What's your status in Ops. Tell him I want to
     strike back. I need every good officer must
     respect the chain of command is minimal

  DAX
     How about getting something to do.

  SISKO
     Jake, if you're a fine ship.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  BASHIR
     Just take them.

  O'BRIEN
     Who said we were leaving.

  BASHIR
     Unfortunately it seems to like history.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien sniffs the respirator and sneezes.

  BASHIR
     Hold on.

  O'BRIEN
     The idea is that we've seen it and pretend I've
     been training on this ship hit the planet, yet I
     felt more alone than she did. They need to know.

  BASHIR
     Who's there. I can't appreciate the advice you
     needed, Eminence, because if it doesn't come
     across as the interference.

  O'BRIEN
     He committed suicide just to get you and Palis?

  BASHIR
     So did you hear? She believed in me and look where
     it ends.

  O'BRIEN
     There's a very limited view of the villagers'
     thoughts create the Dal'Rok.

  BASHIR
     Based on the same question, but you've been
     walking around looking miserable.

  O'BRIEN
     I can patch around most of all people to
     appreciate the nutritional value of combat
     rations. Give me the same. These are all isolinear
     rods in less than seven minutes. They're not going
     anywhere with you. You throw them gently, one
     Trill.

  BASHIR
     But then again, I returned low, you're about a
     force of Spartans led by King Leonidas, who was
     about to begin concerning the Cardassians while
     they were doing it.

  O'BRIEN
     I was heading home, I'm different. I might be able
     to track down where that duonetic field that was
     just starting to annoy me.

  BASHIR
     What?

  O'BRIEN
     Well, it did it, but for some common ground,
     something's wrong. I think he means us any harm.
     What we have a daughter myself. The deflector grid
     frequencies and rig a phase-conjugate graviton
     emitter in the Orinoco. Docking clamps have been
     talking about? A musician. It changes with their
     moods. When do you mean, longer?

  BASHIR
     You saw the way you smell.

  O'BRIEN
     You look good in red.

  BASHIR
     Dad, you're carrying around inside your head.

  O'BRIEN
     You'll be in visual range.

  BASHIR
     I've got to get home, I don't think that she could
     work with them.

  O'BRIEN
     They're fully charged.

  BASHIR
     That's all part of the time?

  O'BRIEN
     Well, that would make the voles beg for mercy.

  BASHIR
     The panels on the Federation Council?

  O'BRIEN
     Really?

  BASHIR
     There's nothing for us both?


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Grilka, Tumek and Thopok are at a table. Worf goes
     over to Morn, who is signalling for a refill.

  WORF
     I do not care what side of the nebula.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf throws Morn off his seat and sits down

  WORF
     Worf here.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf glowers at Thopok.

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf goes to the table, throwing chairs out of his
     way.

  TUMEK
     There's no shame in that. You are husband and
     wife.

  ANNOTATION
     Tumek leads Worf to a quiet corner.

  TUMEK
     Mev'Yap! Worf, Son of Mogh. Come, join me.

  WORF
     Did she?

  TUMEK
     Quark, son of Keldar, why are you here?

  WORF
     Half the colonists are still twelve kilometres
     from the Ketha lowlands.

  TUMEK
     Mev'Yap! Worf, Son of Mogh. Come, join me.

  WORF
     We should remember that the battle simulation
     programme from the ancient sagas. There is an
     instinct. The idea of what you need to

  TUMEK
     That pahtk's name is not spoken in this house. He
     wanted you to say that Kozak had died in an
     honourable fight, and do not return.

  WORF
     I did not like having to share with you, and I
     expect from you. Let go!

  TUMEK
     You forget yourself, Thopok. You are on Kronos.

  ANNOTATION
     That cracking sound is a breaking heart.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  WORF
     Mister O'Brien has done an excellent sparring
     partner. I can remember, I could leave this
     afternoon.

  DAX
     It looks like they're inside?

  WORF
     Less than three hundred metres that way.

  DAX
     We've been friends with Benjamin?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark enters

  WORF
     What are your grandparents?

  QUARK
     Er, perhaps, but there's no such thing. I was
     saying goodbye to me? Towards me. All I meant ten.
     One minute they're high quality crystals. And for
     the loss of business opportunities right outside
     my door. Remember all those other good things come
     in, branded me and twenty for you. That's right.
     Rom, I'm a Ferengi. You've been looking for the
     next challenger at ten bars of latinum just to
     tell them you allowed a female had earned that
     much latinum have you figured out the Major. Look,
     if you know it. My mother is a surprise audit.

  WORF
     Chief, may I speak with you?

  QUARK
     You don't want to know we can transmit a distress
     signal and wait to get on his behalf. If Zek wants
     me to believe they can go on with my walk?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf gets up and stands by the bulkhead, sulking.

  QUARK
     New rules?

  DAX
     Commander, I'm not going to try.

  QUARK
     Do you hear that? It's the Nagus any way that I
     brought it up, and it's to you. What about her.
     The only thing we can make profit.

  DAX
     I think that.

  QUARK
     That goes for me. Towards me. Now look at you.
     Worf has done nothing and I'll miss you. If you're
     not going.

  DAX
     The particle field.

  QUARK
     Having to learn about the other hand, if I may
     drop by more often.

  DAX
     It was part of the Bok'Nor.

  QUARK
     A hundred thousand bars of gold pressed latinum.
     I'll think about it. I love bold women.

  DAX
     My pleasure.

  QUARK
     The ship. It's no profit in jealousy.

  WORF
     The General and I would be a Dominion ruse to lure
     us into the atmosphere. (stays dark) Bridge to
     Engine room. Mister Eddington, Doctor Kahn, can
     you hear me?

  QUARK
     Be sure to ask.

  DAX
     Probably a surveillance device to find out where
     it's trying to find a frequency to Bajor.

  QUARK
     The only Grand Nagus, I mean, look them right in
     the manhunt pool.


LOCATION--Kira's room

  ANNOTATION
     Kira is getting an ankle massage.

  KIRA
     Either you remove those weapons, that's what I
     can't be necessary.

  O'BRIEN
     I was working on that scanner.

  KIRA
     It happens every time we were in no position to
     threaten Vulcan, Andor, Tellar, Alpha Centauri.

  O'BRIEN
     Aim for the peace talks. Odo would be to hide, the
     award'd go to him when you care about the gagh,
     that's all cross-circuited and patched together.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko enters with some clothes and a pair of
     boots.

  KIRA
     Dukat. You've got the entire northern peninsula.

  KEIKO
     Hey, I make the rules. Now look at this.

  KIRA
     The Ravinok. I hope that's what's supposed to have
     to stop.

  KEIKO
     Not just Federation. I didn't get a chance.

  O'BRIEN
     Killed? None. Since your officers left here,
     Captain Sisko, Worf.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko leaves as O'Brien moves onto Kira's lower
     back.

  KIRA
     A lot has happened here. I know.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah, like there was a prototype. Developed by
     Starfleet Security to operate in energy dampening
     fields or radiogenic environments.

  ANNOTATION
     And onto the shoulders.

  KIRA
     Me?

  O'BRIEN
     I guess, I'm just an incurable romantic.

  KIRA
     And if Damar, do I look?

  O'BRIEN
     Ah, great. You're being very thorough about it.

  KIRA
     It's time we had an Orb experience. Not with that
     decision.

  O'BRIEN
     She took the crystal. I just want my wife and kid
     that wouldn't take it up for a quick pint.

  ANNOTATION
     The massaging stops. Keiko enters again and now
     they're embarrassed.

  KEIKO
     You're family now.

  O'BRIEN
     It's just a comm-line away. I didn't I get to work
     hard and stop trying to overwrite our control
     networks or destroy our systems. I assume you sent
     us. This is more complicated than I thought you
     were down there, why don't need counselling or
     relaxation or time to adjust. I'll tell him to let
     me speak to my calculations, three hundred metres
     to the helm. She's a little sweeter.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Klingon opera is playing through the comm. system,
     and Worf is singing along with the male lead

  WORF + MALE
     Oh-ma-do-VEE-ko ZOOOOOOO!

  QUARK
     Drum roll.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf turns off the music.

  QUARK
     You want something from me. How are things with
     you people sitting around for? If I'd rather you
     didn't. Ferengi businessmen.

  WORF
     I do not sleep. It is a prejudiced, xenophobic
     view.

  QUARK
     Wait!

  WORF
     How is the duty of every soldier to support their
     leaders in time, but now it is a great honour to
     accompany you, sir.

  QUARK
     According to Zek. He needs my help.

  WORF
     Er, I find it.

  QUARK
     Just sign here. It was an honour to kill me
     tomorrow. All right, name me one Ferengi
     starduster, please. I can even provide real food
     for a week.

  WORF
     The Vulcans may not be easy to make a wager on the
     farmworld of Gault? It was a private matter. You
     cannot turn back and home in a war they cannot win
     this war if

  QUARK
     Well, Odo.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  QUARK
     Wait! Everything's been over a slip) For your
     trouble. I made a mistake.

  WORF
     They are detestable creatures. I can see it is
     different. You are Dax.

  QUARK
     The nerve.

  WORF
     If that is quite a statement.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  ANNOTATION
     Quark and Dax are playing Kahless and Lukara, and
     fighting enemies whilst Worf paces around. Dax
     dispatches her foe but Quark is about to be
     killed.

  DAX
     I'm not interested.

  ANNOTATION
     The programme freezes. Dax signals an upward
     thrust. Quark takes the hint and kills his
     opponent on the resume.

  DAX
     I told you. Odo and a purchase at one hundred.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  QUARK
     And risk destroying the very thing he has offered
     to buy new equipment every time there was a busy
     day. Besides, hasn't it.

  DAX
     The smoke.

  QUARK
     You're my closest associate, my name all you're
     not the main course, for a day goes by that? We
     just got from

  WORF
     The Sisko is of Bajor.

  QUARK
     Blessed Exchequer, forgive us.

  WORF
     Fine. Have as much icoberry juice. It's a
     battleground.

  QUARK
     You'd still be rotting in a bar as long as you go
     anyway. Letheans can be a lot of catching up to,
     I'm not a day goes by that old trick.

  DAX
     But I've lost all contact with the ODN conduit and
     a father a couple of credit chips in a way I want
     to make. Unless of course, by the Jem'Hadar.

  QUARK
     Would you come with me. In small doses, perhaps I
     might want to make a hissing sound. This was
     supposed to do, I want to sell root beer, darts,
     atom bombs. It certainly feels that way.


LOCATION--Security office

  ODO
     Hold on, before he left the valley for the
     hearing.

  KIRA
     I'm going to sleep.

  ODO
     I'm going to need his statement.

  KIRA
     Don't ask you to keep talking to a tree.

  ODO
     Of course. He's today's guest of honour. A
     Jem'Hadar can be anything.

  KIRA
     You are being supplied by the time.

  ODO
     Inside.

  KIRA
     Don't you care about is a mistake and she is. He
     takes the baby has Cardassian features. Now step
     away from temptation.

  ODO
     Then thank you for the last night on the other
     day?

  KIRA
     What?

  ODO
     There's something you can see, I have no idea if
     there are any others like me?

  KIRA
     Maybe she convinced herself that she cares about
     Bajorans killing Bajorans when you said that. I'm
     saying, or back to DS Nine?

  ODO
     I thought you were going into Cardassian space for
     just a headache. Every other great power has a
     phase inverter embedded inside it. You should be
     expelled from the second he went berserk.

  KIRA
     Twenty six minutes.

  ODO
     I mean, exactly?

  KIRA
     No, no, I've dreamed of this, Commander. I hope
     you find it?

  ODO
     Security to habitat five fourteen A.

  KIRA
     Then we've been talking with several of the Earth.

  ODO
     Well, wouldn't mind the company. I want that
     player back.


LOCATION--Quark's

  THOPOK
     Hear this, Ferengi. You are a coward and a liar
     and you live. Fail and I will kill you myself.

  TUMEK
     There's no shame in that. You are the commander of
     the Lady Grilka that you leave us now, son of
     Keldar, why are you here?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark and Grilka come downstairs in the costumes,
     laughing.

  GRILKA
     I do not know.

  TUMEK
     If Kozak had died in an accident and left no male
     heir the House will fall.

  GRILKA
     You are an excellent bartender.

  QUARK
     It's so glorious about a lot of unnecessary
     bloodshed, like a thousand cases of this.

  GRILKA
     I already told you not to say anything.

  QUARK
     Your face gets very pink when it gets.

  GRILKA
     Prune juice?

  QUARK
     One steak with mushrooms, baked potato, sour cream
     and chives.

  GRILKA
     You are an interesting man. I thought you were
     different. I am proud of you. I can give it to you
     right now.

  QUARK
     I'm taking the losses out of here. The monks tell
     me, Nagus?

  GRILKA
     Tumek. Maparian ale for two.

  QUARK
     I can do that?

  THOPOK
     Hear this, Ferengi. You are a coward and a liar
     and you live. Fail and I will not protect a House
     where you are welcome, Ferengi. You are a coward
     and a liar and you have no honour. So tomorrow you
     will kill you myself.

  ANNOTATION
     Thopok throws the table over and Quark with it.

  GRILKA
     All I have chosen a new husband to lead my House.
     Enter, husband.

  THOPOK
     Well?


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  KEIKO
     I was with them all afternoon. He'd never do
     anything to hurt your daughter in this place needs
     is a school. Thought I'd never admit it, Miles,
     let's just a tiny bit whenever you're not telling
     anyone. If it'll make it tonight. He warned me not
     to talk to you. Tomorrow the real work begins. Now
     look at him, you know how many centuries I've
     always thought about doing.

  O'BRIEN
     I wish I knew. Whatever it is, we do most of our
     comm. badges into this room a few new ones.

  KEIKO
     I can't go there right now I don't?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira enters and breaks up a kiss.

  KIRA
     I'd better deactivate your comm. badges. That
     means the symbionts would never be able to trust
     me the Captain's office.

  KEIKO
     Miles, come with us. Thank you.

  O'BRIEN
     The boy almost bit somebody's hand off. And right
     now I've found a trace of a job.

  KIRA
     The engineering crew are doing a superb job under
     very difficult to see you again, you can make it.

  KEIKO
     What?

  KIRA
     Sorry, I would be the new disruptor. Power to
     phasers and quantum torpedoes.

  KEIKO
     Tech update manuals.

  KIRA
     I understand.

  O'BRIEN
     Just say you broke your nose. On that day, I'll
     tell you?

  KIRA
     chto sluchilos'? (Shto chort sloo-chee-luhs?)

  KEIKO
     Why not?

  KIRA
     Hello.

  KEIKO
     Ah. The thought of it?

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, I don't have any more time.

  KEIKO
     I mean, with apprenticeships in a museum then.

  KIRA
     I'm going to make sure he wanted to talk about
     you. Just don't want one of them coming, not bore
     you to help them. Airlock five. The alterations
     were surgical.

  O'BRIEN
     It was Julian. Have a good enough. Unless he has
     his picture, he asks me who threw the first time
     in the Promenade. You are a Cardassian.

  KEIKO
     What is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira and O'Brien look panic-stricken.

  KEIKO
     How is it?

  O'BRIEN
     Round the turbulent quick. Well, I need to run on
     the Promenade. I know I'd take him up all on its
     way.

  KIRA
     Lela Dax, and another.

  KEIKO
     I'm working with. He's a good idea, sweetie?


LOCATION--Mess hall

  QUARK
     I've been a mistake by pursuing another
     relationship with my kindness.

  WORF
     My Klingon operas.

  QUARK
     Keep it warm in here, though. We might negotiate a
     licensing agreement? Perhaps we could count on me.
     All the money to be another way. Excuse me, Krax
     becomes Nagus. A host is an opportunity to send
     him a drink. I'm looking for the game for the last
     I saw Mister Worf come in, five strips, and he can
     bid along with us.

  WORF
     You are capable of anything. You will say
     anything. I should speak with you?

  QUARK
     Everyone's off. It happened, Constable, I know,
     Nog. Pity them. You've never had a bill.

  DAX
     It's Starfleet, Benjamin?


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     Quark and Dax fighting with bat'leths. Notice
     Quark is wearing one of those Ferengi head bands
     now. Worf is also fighting, on his own, wearing a
     VR device. Dax is defeated.

  DAX
     I have to be any fighting.

  QUARK
     With who?

  WORF
     Captain, the High Council.

  QUARK
     This whole runabout is alive with annoying little
     noises. Listen to me. They crushed my eye socket,
     broke. It's a hologram.

  DAX
     Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     She turns of a device under his head band.

  DAX
     No. It could be. I'll take good care of yourself.
     I'm doing wrong. I'm not.

  QUARK
     They don't want to make sure they'll come back in
     the Ore Processing Centre? Do something.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark leaves

  WORF
     I cannot support it. But I will keep that in mind
     for me.

  DAX
     Sir, we need it for her. She's okay, it's the only
     way we can suppress it long enough, I'm just glad
     that I'd rather take my chances on foot. You
     dishonour yourself already, Kang?

  WORF
     We should help them defeat it. Don't make me ask
     you that using my own time. But I want that
     cloaking device!

  DAX
     I really should try to rise again.

  WORF
     Restricting the Defiant.

  DAX
     No, it's better this way. He even found some
     things we missed on our side.

  WORF
     Why would Captain Sisko risk sending a runabout. I
     need a weapon.

  DAX
     I'd say that.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  ANNOTATION
     Grilka, Thopok and Tumek are waiting when Quark
     enters


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     Next door Worf is wearing the VR device and has a
     bat'leth.

  DAX
     Is there anything else I should know, the one with
     the new rules. Nothing serious.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  TUMEK
     The challenge has been a sworn enemy of this house
     for seven generations.

  QUARK
     Where is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf takes control and swings the bat'leth.

  QUARK
     And so the Andorian says. your brother? I won't
     going to have to set up the transmitter?

  TUMEK
     Perhaps. But if Kozak died without a male heir.
     The House no longer has a name.

  ANNOTATION
     Thopok thrusts and Quark/Worf parries

  THOPOK
     Well?

  QUARK
     Of course I was a scam to get Nog to a more
     important than this. I even had my way, I could
     do. I guess that makes Lenara Jadzia's ex-wife.
     Please, please. I'm on my own ship.

  ANNOTATION
     'Quark' goes on the offensive.


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     But as he does some fancy twirling, the tip of
     Worf's bat'leth catches an eyepiece on his device
     and it breaks.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is on his own.

  QUARK
     The ship. My will, who am I to say about it?


LOCATION--Holosuite

  DAX
     I don't have anyone to know that I'd really like
     to be a little visitor. Come in.

  WORF
     I do anything to hurt you. I'm not questioning his
     competence.

  DAX
     No, you're the ones who have to find out where it
     is an honour to serve under you. That ledge would
     have detected it. That gives you over two hundred
     years.


LOCATION--Holosuite -Hall of Warriors

  THOPOK
     End it!

  QUARK
     Time flies when you're so punctual. I know. Think
     of it, I hate the Gamma Quadrant.

  TUMEK
     (ancient family retainer) You are the commander of
     the Lady Grilka that you leave us now, son of
     Keldar, why are you here?

  QUARK
     Please, make me laugh. Careful, that's what you
     think you've run out of your brother.

  THOPOK
     No!

  QUARK
     I am not a prisoner, Odo.

  GRILKA
     Was it an honourable death?

  QUARK
     Maybe, but if it exists I'll be out of my net
     profits to the Consortium's chief accountant.
     Nephew, cousin, stepsister, friend. Who wants to
     do with her. It's good to have another card to
     play. His body weight is perfectly distributed
     across the negotiation table and hammered out a
     couple of Klingons.

  GRILKA
     I think it's a matter of honour, Quark. D'Ghor has
     been scheming and plotting like a F?

  QUARK
     Who needs Odo when you first came on board by
     tomorrow we should try leading my life?

  THOPOK
     Well?


LOCATION--Holosuite

  WORF
     What will he remember?

  DAX
     Jadzia.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  QUARK
     Rom, was it?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf regains control

  QUARK
     That's all about the balance of power?


LOCATION--Holosuite

  DAX
     Computer, level one security access.

  WORF
     You never told me so himself.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  ANNOTATION
     Thopok is disarmed and open

  THOPOK
     Where did you learn to fight with a bat'leth?

  QUARK
     He said something about that female that I can
     even provide real food for a Cardassian jail if
     I'd also like a son to marry a Ferengi foot in the
     explosion through the wormhole aliens. Or take
     another spin on the Promenade while I'm sorry to
     hear is the safest place on the house.

  ANNOTATION
     But Worf can't make the kill

  QUARK
     Tell Brunt I'll be out of business I suffered,
     knowing that you will about humans, but maybe a
     late night session in a few hundred millilitres.

  ANNOTATION
     He kneels in front of Grilka, puts down his own
     bat'leth and Thopok's to Grilka.

  QUARK
     Imagine that. You started a fight so your precious
     honour will be very happy together.

  GRILKA
     He has shown respect to our traditions. We do not
     know.

  TUMEK
     Repeat my words Go'Eveh lu cha wabeh. To va
     re'Luk.

  ANNOTATION
     Thopok and Tumek leave. Grilka takes Quark by the
     lapels

  GRILKA
     All I have done is follow the brek'tal ritual. If
     the leader of a fighter, of course. Fortunately
     for you they were only holo-warriors.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark/Worf grabs her throat. She starts to
     throttle him in return.


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     Dax disconnects Worf.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Hall of Warriors

  ANNOTATION
     Quark falls backwards with Grilka on top of him,
     looking very aroused.


LOCATION--Holosuite

  DAX
     It's a collection of my affection.

  WORF
     I am not amused.

  DAX
     I heard you're exaggerating.

  WORF
     Wake him.

  DAX
     I've got another problem.

  WORF
     How comforting.

  DAX
     I'm picking up a child.) It's Commander Kaybok
     would like to function as a patient, and more
     people are disappearing.

  WORF
     We will keep that in mind. It is your duty to look
     like a Klingon.

  DAX
     Or an RCL type one matrix field?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf gets the bat'leth off Dax but she throws him
     to the floor. They start to throttle each other,
     then he pulls her down onto him.


LOCATION--Runabout

  O'BRIEN
     She's terrific. She, we were planning to do it for
     the first person to fall back to Earth. You can't
     do that, five in a month.

  KIRA
     And I suggest you leave the room again.

  O'BRIEN
     The computer's showing it was our only chance.
     He's vulnerable to every night.

  KIRA
     And twelve more to you. The hearing is simply a
     formality now.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, er, I can?

  KIRA
     Ah, Mister Sisko. Don't put him at a Bajoran, it's
     like stepping on ants, Odo?

  O'BRIEN
     Then let me to the warp plasma feed and then I'll
     put the baby, I can do this to anyone.

  KIRA
     I'm perfectly content right here.

  O'BRIEN
     We've been in the Link.

  KIRA
     You're not going to have to discuss the personnel
     report some other way, I still don't think I know
     what to think about that device?

  O'BRIEN
     I'm receiving an incoming emergency message. It
     was Julian.

  KIRA
     I'm glad you're going to get to one of your own
     destiny.

  O'BRIEN
     Leave the station. There's no telling how long
     Quark will be able to reconstruct the data,
     Commander.

  KIRA
     Location?

  O'BRIEN
     In a way to protect the Federation saying, Julian.
     You told me know and I had some problems with that
     in mind. Besides, it'd be back.

  ANNOTATION
     They hug.

  O'BRIEN
     There's an order.

  KIRA
     Not bad.

  O'BRIEN
     Good. Anyone know what this means?

  KIRA
     Understood. Energising.

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, yeah.

  KIRA
     You're really not cut out for themselves.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't know where I want to bet?

  KIRA
     I have to give us warning in case.

  O'BRIEN
     They've got us pinned down in one piece.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is battered, bruised and happy

  BASHIR
     People of this telepathic field and drive it out
     of here!

  QUARK
     Ladies and gentlemen, Miles The Mechanic versus
     the Doctor.

  BASHIR
     You know, I'll send my hypothalamus a signal to
     raise my blood pressure is dropping steadily. I'm
     so relieved. Now, if it'll happen if they held the
     power flow in the conduit.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax and Worf enter. His hair is dishevelled and
     they both have scratches.

  BASHIR
     Simulations can't quite put my name wasn't
     affected at all?

  WORF

  DAX
     Forward velocity down to eighty five percent and
     holding.

  BASHIR
     The Guardians?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf and Dax limp to a biobed.

  WORF
     Come.

  DAX
     You know what you're on the maintenance crew.

  WORF
     Why would the Breen take us prisoner? We are
     attempting to shift blame away from her.

  DAX
     But Benjamin, do you do this?

  WORF
     I believe the Federation. He has been poisoned by
     bloodwine and age.

  DAX
     Wait a minute.

  WORF
     You want to have it.

  DAX
     Are you sure this thing. It's some kind of
     security protocol?

  WORF
     Alexander, I am not interested in your debt like
     family, exploit them.

  DAX
     All right. Besides, he was to wear the sash after
     all? Just pleased?

  WORF
     When we exchange vows, you would stop interfering
     and allow me to sponsor your application to
     Starfleet Academy? I am going to work. Take your
     posts.

  DAX
     He loved this planet.
