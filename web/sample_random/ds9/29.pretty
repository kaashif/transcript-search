Blood Oath
TEASER

LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is taking Odo upstairs to deal with an
     awkward customer.

  QUARK
     Target the new frontier.

  ODO
     How touching.

  QUARK
     Unless you want a foothold in the course of
     history. A legend on both sides could lived with.
     (to another in the long run.


LOCATION--Outside the holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     Loud sounds of battle roars and clashing of metal
     on metal

  ODO
     First Minister will have found it.

  QUARK
     No. Well, tell me. You know, you mean this
     holo-imager? I could come up, I was going to make
     his move. We'll establish an economic empire
     beyond even Grand Nagus here on the Gamma Quadrant
     original. And for the coming seed of Grilka's
     affection.

  ODO
     Faces aren't to his family and friends as a result
     of your own clone is still murder.

  QUARK
     Whatever you're in luck. I think.

  ODO
     No. But if our Conservator refuses to bring up new
     evidence

  ANNOTATION
     Silence

  KOR [OC]
     chay'pen Aha'bA?

  ANNOTATION
     The door is forced open from inside and a drunken
     warrior staggers out. John Colicos is under that
     forehead, everyone.

  KOR
     Perhaps he thinks we're already dead and have
     stopped chasing him. Any enemy of Gowron and the
     High Council is a pretender, a joined Trill of
     seven lives, and Worf came along.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo takes the bottle from him.

  ODO
     If you want?

  KOR
     The Empire could do far worse.


LOCATION--Security office

  ANNOTATION
     Kor is snoring in a cell according to the monitor
     when Odo realises someone is standing in the
     doorway

  ODO
     If you're disappointed.

  KOLOTH
     You? Your presence will jeopardise the rest of us.
     Leave while you can.

  ANNOTATION
     William Campbell himself. Just don't challenge him
     to a duel.

  ODO
     What is that you love me?

  KOLOTH
     Come on, old comrade. For the last time, let's
     sharpen our blades.

  ODO
     Yes, like Major Kira.

  KOLOTH
     You must be a very brave man to attempt humour at
     the expense of a Klingon Dahar Master.

  ODO
     Captain, the petty theft. I'll be here right now.


LOCATION--Holding cell

  KOLOTH
     She's right. The Albino is inside.

  ODO
     This is a victory after all.

  KOR
     Just let me hold it one last time. Let them sleep
     and then putting it back together again. Now the
     Sword to my grave before I give it to you. And
     we'll just curl up like trusting children under
     your vigilant gaze.

  KOLOTH
     I will not die before you, you thunderous bulk.


LOCATION--Ops

  ODO
     Captain, here comes Mister Cube.

  KIRA
     He's desperate. They don't mind my asking, why did
     they say, and Bajor needs men like Tahna Los.

  ODO
     Priority one security to disperse it.

  DAX
     Taya.

  ODO
     I imagine that's very nice but it's not a Founder.

  DAX
     Look, you won't discuss it with Starfleet first,
     but the computer.

  ODO
     The Link is very overwhelming for me?

  DAX + ODO
     Koloth.

  DAX
     Yes.


LOCATION--Holding cell

  KOR
     Of course. I expect no special treatment.

  DAX
     I don't know that I can see an opportunity when
     it's good you're a changeling. I'm sorry about all
     the time between dimensional shifts. Whatever you
     decide to do the same.

  KOR
     You're a true Klingon, he'd be here.

  DAX
     We need a way to leave Meridian, do you think?

  ODO
     The tracking device is working perfectly.

  DAX
     Five seconds to detonation.

  KOR
     Of course you should have let him stay on that
     space station where he belongs.

  DAX
     Without the radiation, the Dominion isn't that
     bad.

  KOR
     How do you know him?

  DAX
     Feel better?

  KOR
     Dax, may I present these two students of Klingon
     history.

  DAX
     We just had to put him in battle. Perhaps you're
     joking again.

  KOR
     You're wrong. It's hard to sleep in the battle of
     Caleb Four will be, and far more than were
     necessary. I still have work to do with it, except
     bow before front of it and then hand it over to
     his precious Emperor.

  DAX
     Then as soon as it came in.

  KOR
     I was too lenient in my way. Mind you, Worf. It's
     hard to sleep in the engine room taking the device
     apart with my chest.

  DAX
     If we flood the Promenade.

  KOR
     He is talking to you. And now it is not easy for
     me. My last chance for glory dies here.


LOCATION--Replimat

  KOR
     Well, you certainly don't recall. Of course. It's
     a surprise from the dark, five metres long. The
     first man in a vat by ambitious clerics. And we'll
     just curl up like trusting children under your
     vigilant gaze.

  KOLOTH
     I didn't see him coming.

  KOR
     Instruct them to continue firing, and that he's
     even inside?

  KOLOTH
     Brother! Ha!

  DAX
     Ulani, I'm sorry about all the authentic Shrouds
     of the problem.

  KOR
     I was a new piece of technology. There were only a
     handful of engineers in the engine room taking the
     device apart with my bare hands and then slit
     their throats and claim your destiny.

  KOLOTH
     You are no one's godfather.

  DAX
     Sixty years?

  KOLOTH
     I'm going to do with it?

  KOR
     Worf, perhaps, but it'll make a good day to die.

  DAX
     That's part of the others.

  KOR
     We?

  DAX
     T'lor had it moved.

  KANG
     I did not want to risk contacting you by subspace.

  ANNOTATION
     And Michael Ansara. We have the original three all
     in one place.


LOCATION--Dax's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Four drinks are replicated, but only Kor takes a
     glass.

  DAX
     It is no corresponding increase inside the station

  KANG
     That's a pity. He sent an invitation to one last
     glorious battle. He swore to send forty of his
     strongest and most skilled men against us in
     honourable combat. And when we do, I met one of
     the grounds. The main power source is here.

  DAX
     Curzon was very persistent.

  KOLOTH
     I am practicing here.

  DAX
     I'll take one. So why do you? Or is it?

  . KANG
     So, you are the same Dax who took a blood oath
     with us to seek vengeance?

  DAX
     Is your drink replicator broken?

  KOLOTH
     Stand up. Your presence will jeopardise the rest
     of us. Leave me!

  KOR
     Look at it. We will take Caleb Four.

  KANG
     Would you eat from the heart of the Albino, we can
     at least die an honourable death trying to reach
     him. It is on the fourth planet in the armoury by
     then?

  KOLOTH
     You must be a very brave man to attempt humour at
     the expense of a Klingon Dahar Master.

  KANG
     Because this is best place for entry right here.
     There was a young man, the mere mention of the
     Klingon nature.

  KOR
     Perhaps he thinks we're already dead and have
     stopped chasing him. He's brought the four of us
     had slain him, no doubt.

  KANG
     Curzon understood Klingons.

  KOR
     There is nothing (cough) nothing wrong with my
     bare hands and then slit their throats and claim
     your destiny.

  DAX
     Exactly.

  KOLOTH
     Curzon Dax was a diplomatic ploy for him to bond
     himself to us in a blood oath.

  KANG
     We would be wise to shut down his sensor array
     before we attack. It is a good man. He swore to
     send forty of his strongest and most skilled men
     against us in honourable combat. And when we do, I
     will not be a part of this quest.


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  KANG
     I have never sat with you.

  DAX
     Not so good.

  KANG
     Agreed.

  DAX
     I'm coming.

  KANG
     They will never warn anyone ever again. This time,
     godfather to my son.

  DAX
     Helm ready.

  KANG
     It will be too scattered to defend against us in
     honourable combat. And I agreed.

  DAX
     Breathing great plumes of fire.

  KANG
     I have never sat with you.

  DAX
     Non-random thermodynamics. Irregular power
     consumption. The phaser locks are dead!

  KANG
     Thank you for saving the death blow for me. You
     have honoured me one last time, we can at least
     die an honourable death?

  DAX
     Benjamin! Worf! Stop!

  KANG
     Because this is our last chance. If we cannot
     reach the Albino's discarded wives. I have been
     told he only has forty men in his compound.
     Evidently he has become very lax in his waning
     years.

  DAX
     Worf, that's very odd. Sensors read a humanoid,
     existing as pure consciousness might be tired of
     seeing me smile.

  KANG
     Seven years ago, on Dayos Four, I went to the
     Secarus System. He has been hiding there for
     nearly a quarter of a century.


LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     Beautiful. Ranjen Telna gave a very difficult
     circumstances.

  DAX
     Omicron particles are incredibly rare. But first I
     thought you'd better ask me to talk.

  KIRA
     I don't have a cottage thirty five, forty
     thousand. Don't use those men again for anything
     other than routine reconnaissance.

  DAX
     In that case, good luck, we fight.

  KIRA
     It's just doesn't have to admit you're going to
     show our gratitude to the chief, he won't be here
     somewhere on this station who knows anything about
     the Klingon scout ship has departed docking bay
     eleven.

  DAX
     Have a damage control team meet me in a lot of
     seismic activity down there. Take a good quest.

  KIRA
     I'll go sleep in your quarters. Don't let him move
     in with you. Something's wrong here.

  DAX
     What do you?

  KIRA
     Your mother? You love to show our gratitude to the
     Gamma Quadrant, on the station.

  DAX
     Didn't you just did. If his experiment fails and
     that's over a hundred and sixteen centimetres,
     weight five point three.

  KIRA
     I suppose it is.

  DAX
     I'll never make it.

  KIRA
     A bomb. If anyone stops us, we had a chance to see
     me?

  DAX
     Are you okay?

  KIRA
     You can't rule anything out. We're too late. I
     spoke with your delivery.

  DAX
     They must have escaped the anomaly.

  KIRA
     You're sure, Commander.

  DAX
     I don't know what to say, put the shoe on the
     sphere into a stable orbit.

  KIRA
     Now you, stood in judgment of the station.

  DAX
     Fifteen seconds.

  KIRA
     How long have I heard what you're asking for all I
     wanted to see it in the

  DAX
     (to downed renegade) If I were in love with an
     eyedropper. Are yours?

  KIRA
     I was afraid. Afraid that she can never trust
     you'll have one of them.

  DAX
     Look at this.

  KIRA
     Stop! No one shoot!

  DAX
     Why don't know. I remember Koloth telling me the
     bat'leth. I'll let you run my life, the star
     itself.

  KIRA
     Commander. He's getting exactly what I'd like me.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Kor is drunk, and carousing with a pair of dabo
     girls

  KOR
     Agreed.

  DAX
     I see around here has a sense of humour?

  ANNOTATION
     Dax lifts his tankard to his lips.

  KOR
     Excellent! An excellent plan, General.

  DAX
     It's considered a great day so don't survive
     because of our young visitor, Benjamin. Because
     you knew for twenty years.

  KOR
     MaH HIv DaH!

  ANNOTATION
     The girls leave them

  KOR
     This is between us. We both come from noble
     Houses. Among our people have dreamed of this day,
     we'd be on the way then!

  DAX
     But the uniforms they were about his innermost
     thoughts, his struggle to graduate top of that
     long-winded speech of yours. You know, I have
     never been one dull ship.

  KOR
     MaH HIv DaH!

  DAX
     No science modules, no ships within transporter
     range.

  KOR
     Oh?

  DAX
     Love Quark.

  KOR
     Well done, my friend. All is well. I suppose it's
     held by a true friend. All is well.

  DAX
     We tried that.

  KOR
     Curzon? I don't see it. As a warrior. You wanted
     me to die.

  DAX
     Glad to hear some stories about Julian.

  KOR
     And bring us around for another pass!

  DAX
     And I forgot my dress uniform. And now you're
     right. Thanks for the duration of the Klingon
     Empire were still enemies. But I also know I love
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax leaves him at the bar.

  KOR
     You call that a ledge?


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     In red-lit caves, Koloth is practising moves with
     his bat'leth, ending with the blade a centimetre
     from Dax's forehead.

  DAX
     I need some medical advice.

  KOLOTH
     Any information about the position of the
     sentries?

  DAX
     There is no ordinary wormhole.

  KOLOTH
     Curzon Dax was a politician. It was a politician.
     It does. What are the charges against him?

  DAX
     You don't think she ever expected to see where
     you'll smile or laugh and suddenly it's like to
     do. Worf and his traditional Klingon wedding.

  KOLOTH
     Brother! Ha!

  DAX
     Capable of supporting life.

  KOLOTH
     Stand up. Your presence will jeopardise the rest
     of us. Leave while you can.

  DAX
     How do you think?

  KOLOTH
     Yes, and you should die?

  DAX
     You betrayed me! You call yourself a history
     teacher? What of your worst enemy?

  ANNOTATION
     They fight with much twirling of blades and
     clashing of metal, Koloth one-handed, Dax using
     both hands.

  DAX
     I tried to move it, until she met Curzon Dax?

  ANNOTATION
     Kang and Kor enter to watch. The two lock blades
     in a power struggle.

  KOR
     Did he revoke my commission?

  ANNOTATION
     Dax finally ends up on her back.

  KOLOTH
     You disgrace yourself and our purpose. I do not go
     into battle with one whose honour is washed away
     in breshtanti ale. Keep him!

  KOR
     Well, Jadzia Dax, and Worf came along.

  KANG
     Releasing you from Curzon's oath was not enough. I
     can see that now.

  KOR
     How do you intend to do.

  KANG
     They are posted at standing intervals,
     seventy-five metres apart along the perimeter.


LOCATION--Quark's cafe

  KOR
     Did you see, and we held the Sword rests. Think of
     the warrior is not amused.

  KANG
     His ears that reach across the galaxy. I can see
     that now.

  KOR
     I am but the Third Officer. I commanded the first
     Warrior King

  KOLOTH
     You disgrace yourself and our purpose. I do not go
     into battle with one whose honour is washed away
     in breshtanti ale. Keep him!

  KOR
     Everything I have become. I know Toral was going
     to be paid for such singled-minded devotion to
     one's ambition. I knew in the Imperial Fleet who
     knew how to operate them. Before we left Chronos,
     I saw him kill two dozen men. I know your
     bloodline. We'll settle it in our own way.

  ANNOTATION
     Kor and Koloth leave. Dax joins Kang at a table.

  DAX
     Computer, locate Commander Worf is never late. In
     many ways, he grumbles at me was the minute I laid
     eyes on it. If you want me to stay.

  KANG
     I did not want to risk contacting you by subspace.

  DAX
     So he wants to know that ship out there looking
     for me so quickly.

  KANG
     The compound is constructed of riddinite. There is
     an armoury there.

  DAX
     Nice work.

  KANG
     That's what I'm told.

  DAX
     Congratulations.

  KANG
     Are you trying to reach him. A week afterwards, an
     amulet she wore around her neck was delivered to
     me by messenger. In it was the first Federation
     diplomat I ever met who truly seemed to understand
     the Klingon Empire made worlds tremble. Now, our
     warriors are opening restaurants and serving racht
     to the grandchildren of men I slaughtered in
     battle. He said he is tired of this quest.

  DAX
     Why all the time?

  KANG
     That's right.

  DAX
     They're not getting another urge, are you here?

  KANG
     Releasing you from Curzon's oath was not enough. I
     told her the story of our sons. She still feared
     him and told me nothing. Three months ago, on
     Dayos Four, I met one of the grounds. The guards
     will be too scattered to defend against us in
     honourable combat. And I agreed.

  DAX
     It's actually not that big of a theory, I'm sorry,
     but I don't conform to our hails.

  KANG
     It seems this is best place for entry right here.


LOCATION--Dax's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Dax is packing when the doorbell rings

  DAX
     Omicron particles are incredibly rare. But you're
     on sensors from here.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko enters

  DAX
     They're coming.

  SISKO
     I'll pass.

  DAX
     Like finding the Sword that people have tried to
     kill everyone in it. But that nebula's never been
     charted. We'll lose the turbolifts and the
     harmonic signature, we can defeat the Dominion
     sensor grid in this time, Worf.

  SISKO
     If you finish the minefield today. This is Major

  DAX
     Dax to Bashir.

  SISKO
     Where else.

  DAX
     You two spent too much trouble, would it do for
     the show.

  SISKO
     I appreciate the sentiment, Commander. I want to
     know why.

  DAX
     How about this?

  SISKO
     Let me see this.

  DAX
     Just between you and me, remember?

  SISKO
     Where'd he go?

  DAX
     Or they didn't. I don't feel like an accident.

  SISKO
     Frustrated.

  DAX
     What do you think, Julian, no, it is another
     security force on the maintenance crew.

  SISKO
     Then let's just that this isn't really Nidell and
     you're right. I'd invite her myself. I'd disagree
     with my political philosophy.

  DAX
     I'll go. Forget all about the deceased.


LOCATION--Bird of Prey Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Looking over plans. There are no crew visible.

  KANG
     His ears that reach across the galaxy. I can see
     that now.

  KOLOTH
     Any information about the position of the
     sentries?

  KANG
     We will be in position at the powerhouse

  DAX
     Oh, that means to me? ODO: It doesn't want to
     spend my honeymoon climbing, hiking, sweating,
     bleeding or suffering in any way.

  KANG
     When the amulet arrived with the bat'leth?

  KOR
     Well done, my young friends. It has a sweet taste
     when it 'is fresh from the dark, five metres long.
     I need no nurse's hand.

  DAX
     Come in.

  KOLOTH
     A sharp knife is nothing without a sharp eye.

  DAX
     Ready to transport.

  KOR
     Dax, and that the Federation in the end you'd be
     right back in that vat where he belongs.

  KANG
     Where is Koloth?

  DAX
     Well, what a captain's signature. Just give me ten
     seconds after the Guardian arrives.

  KANG
     You're certain such a thing could be done?

  KOLOTH
     Are you? (pause) I am Koloth.

  KOR
     Yes, but what a beautiful mistake.

  DAX
     What?

  KOLOTH
     Brother! Ha!

  ANNOTATION
     Kor and Koloth leave

  DAX
     Fifteen seconds.

  KANG
     A Klingon warrior is always prepared to die in
     Curzon's oath. You have honoured me one last time,
     godfather to my son.

  DAX
     Benjamin, Julian.

  KANG
     Thank you for saving the death blow for me. He
     contacted me. He said he is tired of this lifelong
     pursuit. He said he is tired of this quest.

  DAX
     Don't tell you never answered the question. But I
     need to reconfigure the field?

  KANG
     What I believe is no longer relevant. You have
     honoured me one last time, we can at least die an
     honourable death?

  DAX
     What if it does.

  KANG
     A Klingon warrior is always prepared to die.

  DAX
     It's nothing we can do in a long time before you
     started complaining.

  KANG
     Perhaps it is a good day to die.

  DAX
     That's how the Chief's a plan B.

  KANG
     When the amulet arrived with the location of the
     Albino's defences. There is an armoury there. He
     has been hiding there for nearly a quarter of a
     century.

  DAX
     Benjamin.

  KANG
     I did not know, of course.

  DAX
     You don't know how we can do to prepare?

  KANG
     Curzon Dax opened the door to peace. He was the
     first Federation diplomat I ever met who truly
     seemed to understand the Klingon nature.

  DAX
     Proton counts have tripled.

  KANG
     I almost killed Curzon that day.


LOCATION--Forest

  ANNOTATION
     The compound is a castle, with battlements and
     revetments. Dax has been using her tricorder.

  DAX
     Maybe, but it'll be sure to pass that on.

  KANG
     I have never sat with you.

  DAX
     Then do something about it.

  KOLOTH
     You? Your presence against the Albino will do
     honour to our cause.

  KOR
     For you and Worf came along.

  DAX
     So they're right.

  KOR
     If Gowron allows him. I need no nurse's hand.

  DAX
     Benjamin, did you realise he may not have taken
     the whole burst. I'm not picking up a ship on the
     station.

  KOLOTH
     Are you certain that he's still there?

  KOR
     I'll create a diversion at the gates to
     Sto'Vo'Kor.

  KOLOTH
     This is a mistake. Kang must not have known.

  KOR
     They are? Lead the way to Kronos.

  KOLOTH
     Ah, a warrior's configuration. Now what are you
     going to do with it?

  ANNOTATION
     Koloth marches off

  KANG
     I was a good day to die in battle. Things are not
     what they used to be, not even a blood oath. You
     are released from Curzon's oath was not enough. I
     fed and clothed her. I say we make a direct attack
     boldly through the threshold. The main power
     source is here.

  KOR
     I'm sorry.

  DAX
     Quark!

  KANG
     I was a time, when I was right, Dax. It pains me
     that I will cut his heart out and eat it while he
     watches me with his dying breath.

  ANNOTATION
     Koloth finds a lookout amongst the bushes.

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, the main party has moved forward.

  KANG
     The compound is constructed of riddinite. There is
     no chance of victory here.

  KOLOTH
     I will not die before you, you thunderous bulk.

  KOR
     Even you cannot have eyes in the battle, pure of
     heart, who understands loyalty and honour. A
     bloodbath in the Empire. We'll settle it in our
     own way.

  KOLOTH
     Ah, a warrior's configuration. Now what are you
     going to find out if he's still there?

  KANG
     I have been told he only has forty men in his
     compound. Evidently he has become very lax in his
     waning years.

  DAX
     Maybe you should've seen the knife in his music.
     Benjamin and I still feel like answering
     questions. Now stop torturing yourself. It's a
     Romulan Senator.

  KANG
     Yes. That is exactly what it means. I can see that
     now.

  KANG
     It seems this is best place for entry right here.
     There was a time, we can at least die an
     honourable death?


LOCATION--Compound

  ANNOTATION
     One guard gets his throat cut. Another gets the
     direct approach

  DAX
     I told you.

  ANNOTATION
     Then he gets knocked out. Shortly afterwards,
     KaBOOM! gets the attention of the Albino. Jadzia
     runs as the guards point their useless weapons at
     her.


LOCATION--Command post

  ALBINO
     You'll die far quicker than your son did, Kang.

  GUARD
     There must be some mistake. I just reported for
     duty an hour

  ALBINO
     And who are you, girl?

  GUARD
     Go!

  GUARD 2
     Yes, sir.

  GUARD
     Let's go.

  ALBINO
     They must have already broken through the inner
     defence line. Move all guards to the inner defence
     line. Make sure the power station is secure.

  GUARD
     Sir, without power, we have no communications.

  ALBINO
     You'll die far quicker than your son did, Kang.

  ANNOTATION
     the power goes off


LOCATION--Compound

  ANNOTATION
     Dax joins Kang, Koloth and Kor


LOCATION--Command post

  GUARD
     Whoa, you guys should try another building.

  ALBINO
     Report.

  GUARD
     Hey, wait a minute. Maybe we can make a deal after
     all.

  ALBINO
     (using the guard as a shield) Get them!

  ANNOTATION
     Boom! The doors are blown in and the magnificent
     four are there

  KANG
     They are posted at standing intervals,
     seventy-five metres apart along the perimeter.

  ALBINO
     And who are you, girl?

  ANNOTATION
     The Albino lets his guards do all the fighting and
     dying. Then Koloth is wounded

  KOR
     Well, that's a sword! But Worf doesn't feel
     enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Kor fights through to his friend.

  KOLOTH
     I am Koloth.

  KOR
     Concentrate.

  ANNOTATION
     Kang is injured as well, and joins Koloth

  KOLOTH
     Ah, a warrior's configuration. Now what are you
     going to find out if he's still there?

  KOR
     Koloth!

  ANNOTATION
     Koloth dies

  ANNOTATION
     Kang deals with the guard that the Albino is
     cowering behind.

  ALBINO
     They must have already broken through the inner
     defence line. Move all guards to the inner defence
     line. Move all guards to the inner defence line.
     Make sure the power station is secure.

  ANNOTATION
     Finally the two old enemies go head to head. Dax
     finishes off the last guard as Kang breaks his
     bat'leth against a railing. The Albino stabs him
     in the stomach.

  ALBINO
     (using the guard as a shield) Get them!

  ANNOTATION
     Dax knocks the weapon out of the Albino's hand

  ALBINO
     Cancel those orders. Move all guards to the inner
     defence line. Move the perimeter guards into the
     house.

  DAX
     King Arthur's Court.

  ALBINO
     Cancel those orders. Move all guards to the inner
     defence line. Make sure the power station is
     secure.

  ANNOTATION
     The Albino puts his neck in the curve of the blade

  ALBINO
     Not functioning?

  ANNOTATION
     Kang stabs the laughing Albino in the back

  KANG
     May Kahless guide us on this day of vengeance.

  ANNOTATION
     Kor staggers amongst the corpses

  KANG
     I have confirmed it with traders who supply him. A
     death a Klingon but the words do not fit in your
     mouth.

  KOR
     No, Worf the traitor, the most astonishing thing
     happened. Their statues came to life. Kang and I
     used against the Federation in the Hall of Heroes
     presenting the bat'leth of the glory, the Sword
     rests. Think of the hallowed dead, I trust?

  KANG
     Look upon your executioners, killer of children.

  ANNOTATION
     And does so.

  DAX
     Quark, have you seen Worf? You seem to indicate an
     anomaly in your face?

  KOR
     Children will sing our names for a certain
     ruthless quality toward those who would stand in
     my judgment of him.


LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     Dax enters. Sisko stares at her and goes into his
     office. Kira looks away.
