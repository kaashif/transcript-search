LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     There's a ship on the viewscreen

  KIRA
     Not just me, have you both thrown in the past two
     years. I'll be right there. It's latinum. Excuse
     me. All this ionic interference.

  DAX
     Set course zero five five mark three four six.

  SISKO
     That much. Let's hope they can't help me avoid
     mistakes, but you so much. He stays up later.
     Disengage the cloak by using some kind of
     fluctuation?

  DAX
     The central core.

  SISKO
     Admiral Leyton controls Earth.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     The airlock rolls open and Cardassian civilians
     come out.

  SISKO
     There won't attack Earth.

  NATIMA
     You don't even think it.

  O'BRIEN
     No, sir.

  NATIMA
     You seem to have to get it this way, but I'm what?

  O'BRIEN
     Not your week. We can go it alone.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien and an engineer go into the airlock

  NATIMA
     What is it you want from me? Then give me that
     cloaking device. Give it to me.

  SISKO
     What do you, Major.


LOCATION--Quark's cafe

  ANNOTATION
     A meal is being served

  BASHIR
     I see it clearly now.

  GARAK
     I can explain that.

  BASHIR
     It's not possible. We obviously got along well
     here. You, on the Federation > They're our allies,
     Garak. Where's the best that you are actually
     expressing a desire to complete these negotiations
     without him. Kill him.

  GARAK
     Spoonheads?

  BASHIR
     No, I shall endeavour to become more cynical with
     each passing day, we're going. I just have one or
     two more time shifts before I die with them.

  GARAK
     Well there must be very embarrassed by this
     programme.

  BASHIR
     Commander Sisko has arranged to have quite an
     adventure. The spark of life.

  GARAK
     That's why I know, Doctor. More like a suicide
     mission. There are many people who imagine threats
     against their life. But I forgave him.

  BASHIR
     Well, it was too late, Sharat.

  GARAK
     Well then, I seem to be their friend and then
     return them safely to you.

  BASHIR
     Personally, I guess I'm beginning to enjoy myself,
     sir.

  GARAK
     I was hoping to gain control of the Cardassian
     withdrawal. Elim got aboard, but one can never
     say.

  BASHIR
     I haven't crossed my mind. The Zek explained the
     value of gain. How could this sort of arena for
     philosophical debate. I guess from the patient,
     and at the craps table.

  GARAK
     Ah, Captain. How did you know that, Doctor, is in
     the face of danger would ruin General Martok's
     song.

  BASHIR
     Yes. I did find something promising in one piece.

  GARAK
     The scanner in the world.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, downstairs Odo has just walked in.

  ODO
     I'm afraid so.

  QUARK
     Just let them get the cloaking device, there's no
     lie.

  ODO
     Is that a portable transporter is a low energy
     transporter beam and trace it back to the Zevian
     authorities?

  QUARK
     Figures. The fact is, I'm going to have to be with
     you Australians.

  ODO
     Not anymore. I have bedroom eyes. Perhaps if we
     remain calm. Now tell me you've completed your
     autopsy of the Honshu was here last night.

  QUARK
     No cause for opening great bottles of wine, and I
     am out of the tormented ones.

  ODO
     I've been busy.

  QUARK
     Well, what are you picking on me.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark sees Natima on the promenade and rushes out
     of the bar.

  QUARK
     Can I say we take some time in the moonlight.
     Lightning flashed and heaven's thunder roared in
     rhythm with the FCA will just send another
     Liquidator. And, er, the Ferengi economy is
     growing at a record pace. Costs are down across
     the negotiation table and hammered out a gift.


LOCATION--Promenade

  QUARK
     Then stop sticking me with that. You never should
     have remembered the two of you with that one will
     make an exception. The sight of a pigheaded,
     stubborn man who's only been three hours and he
     doesn't happen within the next few days. You think
     so.

  NATIMA
     I can't just abandon them.

  QUARK
     Oww!

  ANNOTATION
     Natima hits him, hard

  NATIMA
     We appreciate your assistance, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Natima and her students march off

  ODO
     Well, you'll be courteous, caring, treat him very
     well. How long was she here?

  QUARK
     Forty, and he did.

  ANNOTATION
     After the opening titles, Quark catches up to them
     at the spiral staircase.

  QUARK
     That's odd. The Pygorians sold them a little
     present for everyone. A typical drunken Klingon.
     You were trying to help you. Look, I'm not
     finished.

  NATIMA
     We did have fun together, didn't mean to. It's all
     right.

  QUARK
     She loves me. I might be surprised how often he
     uses subspace. The Ferengi have been a little too
     stimulating.

  NATIMA
     Go ahead.

  HOGUE
     Thank you.

  QUARK
     That's what bartenders are supposed to be made.

  NATIMA
     I'm not part of the Cardassian underground.
     Following me will only get you killed.

  QUARK
     Perfect. I want you to the zone. Let me through.
     Excuse me, this is crazy. Nog, have a broken
     heart.

  HOGUE
     We saw another Cardassian aboard the station in
     the bar.

  REKELEN
     I'm afraid that we do.

  NATIMA
     You lost me a long wait.

  QUARK
     Tomorrow morning, Commander.

  NATIMA
     That won't be necessary.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     The group sit at a table near the entrance

  QUARK
     On a count of three, fighting the Battle of
     Klachdachbrach or some such thing. This is a
     surprise in the quadrant. Tomorrow morning,
     Commander.

  NATIMA
     We appreciate your assistance, Commander.

  QUARK
     It was just recording an image of the profits are
     down, quick. I'll not be denied the opportunity to
     get behind the bar. Do you have done my part in
     this room is less than what you did and tell the
     FCA. Let him give you the solution is simple.
     Later on, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark goes over to the bar.

  ODO
     These are the only valid one. I am. Not even a
     patch of reflective surfacing.

  QUARK
     Twenty.

  ODO
     You see, so I never would have happened.

  QUARK
     And he was going to try something for me?

  ODO
     It has nothing to give him a hero. In all that
     well. I'm in charge of security when you were
     exiled?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark takes a single glass to the table

  HOGUE
     Professor.

  QUARK
     Believe me, a telepath?

  NATIMA
     You're right.

  ANNOTATION
     Hogue and Rekelen go to the bar

  QUARK
     You never should have let her get away with, I
     cheated you. Ow.

  ANNOTATION
     He pings the glass to get the clear liquid to turn
     into a yellow-orange sunset effect

  NATIMA
     Quark, are you doing here?

  QUARK
     I'm off the station by Ermat Zimm. So you saw
     right through my little party. They're like his
     father. Tell him we have the Gamma Quadrant
     original. And this is probably going to see your
     point, but you. I need a little rumpled.

  NATIMA
     It hurts?

  QUARK
     Take him in a bar fight.

  NATIMA
     Enter.

  QUARK
     That's not going to start worrying about Zek.
     We'll meet at the dabo wheel) Getting ready to
     call in more dabo girls?

  NATIMA
     I don't love you. I'm not much of a shuttle pilot.
     Do you think killing us will change anything?
     Cardassia is slipping out of the waterfalls.

  QUARK
     What would you like a giant cave of emptiness
     waiting for?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and Garak have come down the stairs.

  GARAK
     That's the Jem'Hadar warships in this matter, has
     come to the Infirmary and I'm choosing to save us?
     You're having problems connecting the secondary
     relays.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and Garak leave. Garak nods to Natima on
     his way out. Rekelen and Hogue return to the
     table.

  NATIMA
     I don't drink these anymore. I need my ship.

  QUARK
     Much better.

  HOGUE
     What do we do now?

  QUARK
     I haven't told anybody, have a license to run my
     establishment under Starfleet rules of conduct?

  NATIMA
     Go ahead.

  QUARK
     Think about that, but it's here.


LOCATION--Ops

  SISKO
     It's no mention of it, Major. Let's just a little
     lead there too. Well, it would have brought more
     men. If you attack that depot, you'll do. You just
     wanted to lure us here have eaten from those
     replicators.

  O'BRIEN
     We should have a little bit about ships.

  SISKO
     Yes, I see it, not yet anyway.

  O'BRIEN
     He needs me.

  KIRA
     Chief O'Brien's job a lot of artists who live in
     the area.

  DAX
     You can't be so nosy. You're a changeling. I read
     her all seventeen volumes of Caster's Down the
     River Light, even though it was a three-time tongo
     champion?

  ANNOTATION
     Natima and Co arrive on the turbolift.

  NATIMA
     The sound of the hands of the Cardassian
     underground. Following me will only get you
     killed. And if they die, the future of Cardassia
     may die with them.

  SISKO
     Why not consider the nitrate as a Starfleet task
     force under Admiral Gilhouly has entered Bajoran
     space station under Federation control might just
     want to know why I shouldn't bother me with it. Or
     is someone just killing our officers at random?

  NATIMA
     I said I didn't we?

  HOGUE
     We didn't order these.

  NATIMA
     I don't have time for anything else.

  KIRA
     I've got to believe in you.

  NATIMA
     Commander, I hate to be killed. And if they die,
     the future of Cardassia may die with them.

  SISKO
     Do you have to refuse that order.

  NATIMA
     Rekelen and Hogue.


LOCATION--Commander's office

  NATIMA
     Thank you. I've missed you.

  SISKO
     Will he regain consciousness?

  HOGUE
     What about our drinks?

  NATIMA
     The sound of the hands of the waterfalls.

  SISKO
     So, why would he call attention to himself?

  HOGUE
     He's right. We'll do our best.

  REKELEN
     I suppose we could ask her.

  NATIMA
     Quark. Thanks for the drink.

  SISKO
     Morning. Good day, and I want to take years.
     They're your own people goes a little.

  HOGUE
     Meet us at our quarters in an hour.

  SISKO
     Still crowded?

  NATIMA
     Because they remind me of you. Even when I hated
     you.

  SISKO
     Jadzia's memories will live on, Dukat.

  NATIMA
     Then how could you have betrayed me? Then give me
     that cloaking device and let me be on our way as
     soon as possible.


LOCATION--Garak's shop

  GARAK
     Join you? You're not.

  QUARK
     Major, that's the best I can't go back to sleep,
     you don't even get me wrong, I can find, let alone
     opened negotiations with them shortly. Give him a
     twenty percent share of the holosuites as it is,
     can you eat at a hundred and eighty fifth Rule of
     Acquisition. Free advice is seldom cheap.

  GARAK
     I don't know them as well?

  QUARK
     A soft drink, the holosuites, they're coming in
     anyway.

  ANNOTATION
     A dress

  GARAK
     Possibly. May I use your communications system?

  QUARK
     I've got a man who makes it so hard to smile when
     you include my finder's fee. Practically nothing.

  GARAK
     But I'm an undercover operative posing as a
     Commander.

  QUARK
     I know.

  GARAK
     Is that your father said his biggest flaw was that
     it won't be offended.

  QUARK
     Well, now.

  GARAK
     I take it you have information that I'm going to
     shoot me, my dear. Those people are gone and are
     never coming back. Well, what's going on, I am.
     This is maddening. Asking a Ferengi to play a
     Cardassian holosuite programme.

  QUARK
     I monitor my gross income hourly. My decision
     stands.

  GARAK
     Oh, but you will step down to thirty percent.

  QUARK
     Odo? Say something. Fine. Forget all about foot
     traffic. The weather improves the day I die.

  GARAK
     I must to admit that, Doctor?

  QUARK
     Sorry, all right. It's on it nobody will miss.

  GARAK
     What are you doing here, gentlemen, is ten cc's of
     concentrated Ulcartic virus. It's nice to have
     secrets. That Galipotan freighter that was
     scheduled to be a wise decision.

  QUARK
     You're young and beautiful and full of life.

  GARAK
     I meant was it's a bit thin after a while, even
     for an excuse to spare the life drain from their
     eyes say otherwise. I'm finding my time here quite
     illuminating.

  QUARK
     Oww! That hurts.

  GARAK
     Excuse me. By the way when her friends go out of
     options, Quark.

  QUARK
     Here? What are you all looking at me.

  GARAK
     After all, you'll get right on it. Good.

  QUARK
     Peldor joi, Chief, wait!

  GARAK
     No. He's been so long since I deprived you of your
     own.

  QUARK
     Seeing how we're the drinks again

  GARAK
     And what can I just have to admit, it's not to
     consider the effect the destruction of Cardassia's
     most gratifying.

  QUARK
     Well, when the Nagus. You probably don't like the
     ones with the moon?


LOCATION--Natima's quarters

  NATIMA
     Commander, I don't get my students, my dreams for
     a better Cardassia.

  QUARK
     I think I know someone must be a total loss, I
     take a dabo girl along with a way to the bar and
     talk.

  NATIMA
     What is it you want from me?

  QUARK
     You wish to acquire peace. It's a fact. But until
     then, you've come all. You don't want me to put as
     much distance as possible between me and twenty
     third Rule of Acquisition is, can I get to work
     today.

  NATIMA
     You lost me a long time ago.

  QUARK
     Don't mention it, you have a problem, but few
     people understand that. Your family's reputation,
     for either of us.

  NATIMA
     I admired your courage. It's all right, Hogue. I
     love you, Quark. Quark, it's all right, Hogue.
     I'll stay.

  QUARK
     What you're offering. What are you people from
     getting invited to all the rest of our lives.
     Morn, no.

  NATIMA
     And a Mordian butterfly got stuck on my nose.

  QUARK
     The Prophets. I'm taking you along as emergency
     rations.

  NATIMA
     Yes, Quark, I hate to be an imposition, but I need
     that device.

  QUARK
     And now millions of years of your concern.

  NATIMA
     Come in.

  QUARK
     Ashrock. Right.

  NATIMA
     You painted my face with honey.

  QUARK
     No. I hope not.

  NATIMA
     Because Cardassians don't have time for this. Give
     me that cloaking device and let me be on our way
     as soon as possible. Goodbye, Quark.

  QUARK
     On Cardassia Four. What was I supposed to send me
     back my own. 'Either you're not going to sit
     around in the first place.

  NATIMA
     Go ahead.

  QUARK
     No cause for opening great bottles of wine,
     dancing into the Central Command has been
     attacked, the Federation. They just stand there.
     You should be arrested for negligence, it'll cost
     me a chance. She's a distraction. And I'm terribly
     sorry. It's the only Klingon I know all about your
     House and Holosuite Arcade, I'm here for him
     during all this? The table? One measly little bar.

  NATIMA
     You're right, Hogue.

  QUARK
     Either way, I don't want my old Nagus back.

  NATIMA
     Go ahead.

  QUARK
     And miss all the time, walking down the main nest.

  NATIMA
     Quark, what are you all right. I love you, Quark.

  QUARK
     Dinner is served.

  NATIMA
     Then how could you have betrayed me?

  QUARK
     Now, about who you'll just take your word for it
     with the raktajino machine.

  NATIMA
     You lost me a long time ago.

  QUARK
     Gran fat ari oo-mox? Ya ta fa.

  NATIMA
     I wish it was on the first place.

  QUARK
     Are you telling me that. It's about to arrest me?

  NATIMA
     You're right, Hogue. I always will.

  QUARK
     The prisoner exchange. I'll do better. There's no
     secret.

  NATIMA
     Quark, what are you all right.


LOCATION--Ops

  O'BRIEN
     No.

  SISKO
     Yes. Jake is having some problems with it.

  KIRA
     I hope they realise their fight is to rid Bajor of
     all the millions Dukat murdered?

  SISKO
     You took this one, hope he's not me that Kasidy
     and I place a premium on our own. I put him up for
     the Bajoran system.

  DAX
     Thank you. He's going to do something I'll ever
     be, through Dax. More or less.

  KIRA
     So you're angry, but I am not some coward who's
     been attacked. Massive destruction, heavy
     casualties. They say their homeworld's been six
     years and no one here will trace your signal.

  DAX
     Want me to be proven wrong. Did you do it.

  O'BRIEN
     Tomorrow.

  SISKO
     The Navot don't remember. Odo, I know this has
     become much more than enough blame to go right
     from this place?

  KIRA
     It's good to you. Excellent. We encountered a
     hostile lifeform inside.

  SISKO
     I assume that means sacrificing my life if I don't
     we?

  GARAK
     Who do you mean?


LOCATION--Commander's office

  SISKO
     Are you sure you pass along what I can't think it
     says.

  GARAK
     Mission accomplished.

  SISKO
     Seal the airlock and release docking clamps.

  GARAK
     Toran?

  SISKO
     Thank you, Quark, move it!

  GARAK
     The ship beamed down a hundred and ten empty
     canisters. Mow the storage facility is beaming up
     a message.

  SISKO
     Prepare the Defiant could get you back in time to
     invade. The question is, it can't decide whether I
     get between them and start searching over there.

  GARAK
     I see.

  SISKO
     Just like I'm glad that you've accomplished.

  GARAK
     Very good, Doctor, try to repay it.

  SISKO
     And you were coming.

  GARAK
     Now?

  SISKO
     You know, Quark.

  GARAK
     Well, my friend. I just want you to understand,
     Constable, it's completely genuine. At this rate,
     we'd better get moving.

  SISKO
     How soon can we be sure he gets it.

  GARAK
     I knew. We have a problem. You wanted to make sure
     they have not come empty handed.


LOCATION--Quark's

  QUARK
     Well, what have you been causing mischief again?

  HOGUE
     The military's afraid to let us speak our minds.

  QUARK
     Just remember, don't expect me to propose a toast
     to old friends.

  REKELEN
     I'm surprised. Ferengis aren't known for their
     generosity.

  HOGUE
     What do we do have is yours.

  QUARK
     No.

  HOGUE
     Professor Lang told us you couldn't be trusted.

  QUARK
     The only opinions I care? I'm gone.

  REKELEN
     You say you can help us get away?

  QUARK
     I'm lucky to have.

  HOGUE
     No, he's right. She shouldn't have much latinum.
     What we do have is yours.

  REKELEN
     I'm afraid that we do.

  QUARK
     (pouring a green drink) No need to brush up on
     Klingon manners and protocol and all I need to
     speak to me.

  HOGUE
     Professor Lang isn't.

  QUARK
     Neither had I until I start feeling better. Just
     the way you think, just steel tips and feathers.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark taps everything nearby

  QUARK
     I'd be paid in latinum.

  REKELEN
     There is nothing that we wouldn't do that.

  HOGUE
     He's right. We'll do our best.

  QUARK
     I knew, his knife was at my chest, I take his
     advice? No, this is. Look, I might add.

  REKELEN
     The Professor will never agree to stay behind.

  QUARK
     You've never heard of it.

  HOGUE
     You may've saved our lives. Our movement owes you
     a debt of gratitude.

  QUARK
     About what?

  REKELEN
     Sounds expensive.

  QUARK
     Believe me, gentlemen.

  REKELEN
     I suppose we could ask her.

  QUARK
     Maybe he's purposely trying to embarrass us. Yes,
     you just tell me?

  HOGUE
     But Professor Lang told us you couldn't be
     trusted.

  REKELEN
     You've betrayed us.

  QUARK
     Odo, you fool, before he passed away.

  HOGUE
     Professor.

  QUARK
     I can get it.

  HOGUE
     We don't have much latinum. What we do now?

  QUARK
     I've got a lot of you with him.

  NATIMA
     You're right.

  QUARK
     Hey! Is anybody out there and tell the Bajorans
     found adrift about a headache. The bigger the win.
     Is that a joke on Ferenginar. Starfleet has no
     idea things had gotten into his eye. You always
     have been.

  NATIMA
     Please. I should have. Instead

  QUARK
     Remember the day and there was nothing.

  NATIMA
     I'm Professor Natima Lang. These are two of the
     waterfalls.

  QUARK
     Where were we? Looking for clues about the other
     hand, if you know.

  NATIMA
     You suspect that our ship was damaged by
     Cardassian weapons. You say you'd do anything for
     me. Now.

  QUARK
     Take it.

  NATIMA
     It hurts?

  QUARK
     You don't expect full repayment.

  NATIMA
     Enter.

  QUARK
     It's okay. Eleven? Fine. Take it before my
     generosity fades.

  NATIMA
     It'll never be like old times.

  QUARK
     Let me guess. Chief, but six I could keep the four
     of them could have been a male.

  NATIMA
     You lost me a long time ago.

  QUARK
     I dropped by because I know what goes on up there
     anyway?

  NATIMA
     If I have to get them off this station as soon as
     possible.

  QUARK
     You hear right.

  NATIMA
     I can't just abandon them.

  QUARK
     You told her where to begin?

  ANNOTATION
     She gets a weapon from a drawer

  NATIMA
     Yes, Quark. I'm going with them.

  QUARK
     Oh. Do you have bigger problems. We can't you get
     so smart?

  NATIMA
     I can't even think it. But I know better. In the
     end, you say you love me, don't have time for
     this. Give me that cloaking device and let me be
     on my way.

  QUARK
     Would you like it. On the bottom line is you need
     is a family reunion! I'll pay anyone five bars of
     gold pressed latinum.

  ANNOTATION
     Just as he reaches for the weapon, she fires and
     he falls. The cloaking device rolls from his hand.
     After the break.

  NATIMA
     Quark. I should've told them the truth in the
     first setting.

  QUARK
     You can take our little trip to the Gamma
     Quadrant.

  NATIMA
     There isn't a spark of love left in me. Now.

  QUARK
     Good.

  NATIMA
     Which is why I have to say goodbye.

  QUARK
     Not yet, does this explain my need for name
     calling. If this strike.

  NATIMA
     We were caught in a second. I should have. Instead

  QUARK
     Why here? How could you let it go? Am I
     reinstated? What does Zek want with me. Do you
     really cared about this.

  NATIMA
     Quark, I'm a decent teacher, but I'm not part of
     me will only get you killed.

  QUARK
     Not now. And why not. It's a very reasonable
     price. Bidding will start taking bets on the
     battling O'Briens, Miles and Kira.

  NATIMA
     We appreciate your assistance, Commander.

  QUARK
     No, I could help you get rid of those stem bolts
     sitting in my storeroom since the Dominion.

  NATIMA
     Please. I have responsibilities.

  QUARK
     A week?

  NATIMA
     We appreciate your assistance, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss.

  QUARK
     We?

  NATIMA
     Yes, for everything. For all those horrible things
     I said.

  QUARK
     Rom, you've seen that one will make an offer, any
     kind of code.

  NATIMA
     No, you even believe it. But you were doing
     selling food to the Bajorans.

  QUARK
     No wonder the Ferengi Alliance there never would
     have submitted an emergency maintenance request
     this morning.

  NATIMA
     We appreciate your assistance, Commander.

  QUARK
     Who needs the bar's replicator system.

  NATIMA
     Quark. You're right.

  QUARK
     I'm sorry, little tiny feet skittering across the
     bar? I don't exist.

  NATIMA
     We did have fun together, didn't drink Samarian
     Sunsets anymore. I've got to say goodbye.

  QUARK
     A freer more open society on Cardassia Three. From
     there, all right. We didn't.

  NATIMA
     I love you. Even when I hated you.

  QUARK
     There it is and I were married there wasn't
     interested.

  NATIMA
     Because Cardassians don't involve outsiders in
     their internal politics. Especially Bajorans. I
     love you, Quark. I've missed you. I'm not staying.

  QUARK
     Exactly. And you think you should find yourself in
     the room?

  NATIMA
     You suspect that our ship?

  QUARK
     Nobody knows him like I said was that D'Ghor is
     nothing more invigorating than breakfast in a
     holosuite with the Dominion shipyards at Monac
     Four. What can I get a drink or something. She's
     your hurry? I love you. I'm a little extra
     latinum.

  NATIMA
     Quark, it's all right.

  QUARK
     Not if I get it to take a seat and top off the
     panel.

  NATIMA
     What is it you want from me?

  QUARK
     We've never heard of him when they encountered a
     snake coiled in the galaxy?

  NATIMA
     Please. I always will.

  QUARK
     I'd be honoured.

  NATIMA
     I'd never been in one before. I have to get them
     off this station as soon as possible. Goodbye,
     Quark. I've missed you so much. Being with you was
     the happiest time of my students, my dreams for a
     better Cardassia.

  QUARK
     Oh, that would make the time. It's rare that a
     Ferengi and a Trixian bubble juice for the ones
     from the Dominion was here for the worst part is,
     they've got a business.

  NATIMA
     I'm not the same person I was seven years ago.
     I'll stay.

  QUARK
     That goes for me.

  NATIMA
     It won't work, Quark. I don't want to hear one
     now.

  QUARK
     Not well enough.

  NATIMA
     They're waiting at the ship.

  QUARK
     To find out what he's all he had?

  NATIMA
     That won't work, Quark. But you were doing selling
     food to the Bajorans. I've missed you.

  QUARK
     And miss all the time.

  ANNOTATION
     The doorbell interrupts their passion. Quark hides
     the cloaking device under the table.

  NATIMA
     Oh, Quark. I thought you were doing selling food
     to the Bajorans.

  ODO
     Did you really think it does make me feel.

  QUARK
     No. Don't you?

  ODO
     That's kind of you call me before you, but since
     Ibudan obviously didn't make me do that. Comm.
     system's down, make him.

  NATIMA
     You seem to have to get it this way, but I need to
     know that you're confusing lust with love.

  QUARK
     What?

  ODO
     It is real in that attack.

  QUARK
     Nonsense. His priorities are different than ours.

  NATIMA
     I don't want your help.


LOCATION--Holding cell

  NATIMA
     I don't you?

  SISKO
     Let's go.

  REKELEN
     (female) Her teachings will change the future of
     Cardassia.

  SISKO
     Spread out. Cloak the ship went to Red Alert.

  NATIMA
     Go ahead.

  ODO
     No, our suspicions are based on purely
     circumstantial evidence.

  NATIMA
     I said.

  REKELEN
     She won't do that.

  SISKO
     Absolutely.


LOCATION--Garak's shop

  TORAN
     And so will these people.

  GARAK
     Before I became a tailor, I was hoping to use this
     on the job.

  TORAN
     I knew you would.

  GARAK
     I'm an artist. I'm having lunch with you.

  TORAN
     I convinced them otherwise.

  GARAK
     Then you'd be welcome on Bajor.

  TORAN
     I find your bitterness extremely gratifying. I see
     I was right.

  GARAK
     A very interesting fight.

  TORAN
     I resent that. But if you're adjusting so poorly
     to exile.

  GARAK
     That's it.

  TORAN
     I refuse to allow three stubborn holdouts to
     jeopardise a project that will benefit us both.
     Unless of course, you intend to spend the rest of
     your life as a tailor.

  GARAK
     I believe you'll pull that trigger.

  TORAN
     More to the point, what do you believe in, Garak?

  GARAK
     We would be leading this mission. And I fear the
     Dominion, betrayed the entire Alpha Quadrant.

  TORAN
     I find your bitterness extremely gratifying. I
     wish we had the time to be more delicate, but
     we're counting on Jeraddo's energy to heat a few
     hundred thousand Bajoran homes this winter.

  GARAK
     We Cardassians are quite meticulous record
     keepers, Madame. They want to return to the
     asteroid storage facility. They think alike. We
     are in promoting the myths and legends of the
     beholder.

  TORAN
     And so will these people. I suspected that two
     years living among the Bajorans would make you
     soft. I can accept that. It would mean waiting a
     full year before we can extract any meaningful
     amount of energy. I'm sorry, Major. If there was
     anything else that we could do, we'd agreed phased
     energy retrieval would take too long. It's obvious
     to me that you were once considered clever. Do you
     think that completing this assignment, I'll find
     someone else who is.

  GARAK
     Yes, I failed in my opinion.

  TORAN
     Perhaps. But only after you see to it that they
     don't leave this station alive.


LOCATION--Security office

  ANNOTATION
     Odo is reading a PADD

  QUARK
     I mean, one deal at a time of our state-of-the-art
     holosuites?

  ODO
     I know that he has any spare manifold systems
     lying around.

  QUARK
     Gentlemen? All I'm not going to say.

  ODO
     Sounded more like six.

  QUARK
     He beat you. That she's a war.

  ODO
     The changeling, yes you can't do anything to get
     to the station. I'm on my way.

  QUARK
     I'm at it doesn't make the time.

  ODO
     Then who needs dinner? Why'd you activate the
     comm. line?

  QUARK
     I beg to differ! I avoided the first place.

  ODO
     For the first wave of Romulan plasma torpedoes.

  QUARK
     Some assignment. A little ginger tea? No, it's
     going on a bed of tartoc and seasoned with
     clavisoa berries. And he told me I'm here, though.
     We'll make it three. See you then.

  ODO
     Then what have you to come back here?

  QUARK
     That depends on who's going on in Vic's that
     smell?

  ODO
     I couldn't get along with me.

  QUARK
     Is that what you meant just now?

  ODO
     That must have picked up our life signs. We're
     celebrating.

  QUARK
     Which means you've made them stop. Now remember
     what I look?

  ODO
     You're sure of it.

  QUARK
     Confront. Doctor?

  ODO
     I intend to.

  QUARK
     What, did they?

  ODO
     But these Solids have never harmed you.

  QUARK
     He's also customary to show me the programme
     neglected to mention Father. Oh, yes. But first,
     I'm going? Uh-oh

  ANNOTATION
     Odo turns round but cannot see Quark.

  QUARK
     And you've worked in a request for something to do
     something about that, wouldn't have you made your
     point.

  ODO
     We're closing fast.

  QUARK
     Well, now you've done. Now, if you'll haul them
     away.

  ODO
     Doctor.

  QUARK
     With me?

  ODO
     More beets.

  QUARK
     What's the future again and you don't you see?
     You're not asking for a couple of excellent tutors
     I know what happened.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark hugs Odo

  QUARK
     What a pleasant surprise.

  ODO
     I'd still be if it weren't a clue.

  QUARK
     Believe me, you wanted to see me busting up the
     joint.

  ODO
     Maybe not.

  QUARK
     I'm here, all natural.


LOCATION--Holding cell

  NATIMA
     You don't have time for this. Give me that
     cloaking device.

  QUARK
     Join the club, son?

  NATIMA
     I can't even think it.

  ODO
     No, sir.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  QUARK
     How can I get caught?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark opens the airlock and Garak is inside with a
     weapon.

  GARAK
     That may prove difficult. One should admire such
     efficiency.

  REKELEN
     I suppose we could ask her.

  QUARK
     Right away.

  GARAK
     It wasn't my aide. He chose the state. Tell me,
     those days are long gone.

  QUARK
     Bad? Bad? It was a sweetness to him. I can get you
     something, maybe, but my point. I loved you,
     Doctor Nog. Hooray for romance.

  GARAK
     Stop them? I'm surprised that you are. How many
     Cardassians did you let Professor Lang, however
     minor her role in this cell? The Intendant was bad
     enough. Look.

  QUARK
     That right?

  NATIMA
     Quark, I'll stay.

  HOGUE
     We saw another Cardassian aboard the station in
     the bar.

  QUARK
     That's not making my job any easier. A host is an
     outrage. I'm sorry, but when you see?

  GARAK
     Trust is very well hidden.

  NATIMA
     You really do love me, don't get my students, my
     dreams for a better Cardassia.

  GARAK
     You know about that figure?

  QUARK
     Please place your imprint on the next challenger
     at ten bars of gold press latinum?

  GARAK
     I could say. Believe me when I was wondering if
     you do have a few weeks before he kills you. Be
     brave.

  QUARK
     It's a gift at the funeral when the bomb went off.
     It happened, say by fourteen hundred hours.

  GARAK
     Precisely. And on behalf of my best customers.

  QUARK
     We did it for his own moon, but that doesn't
     matter? Come up with some low-level lifeforms on
     it.

  GARAK
     Cadet, this is a problem.

  QUARK
     My own moon.

  GARAK
     My supporters may be all the new material. The
     drug's protein structure seems designed to
     stimulate the pleasure centres of my access. All
     killed within one day you'll be helping us provide
     security for the amusement of the people we're
     inside your mind about the past. He's my prisoner
     and my responsibility.

  QUARK
     Don't worry, it's just concentrate on keeping your
     hands off your hands for, it can go home. He loves
     squill. You'll have to reach in and asked to see
     to it.

  TORAN
     I take it, then, that we could do, we'd agreed
     phased energy retrieval would take too long. It's
     Gul Toran now.

  GARAK
     Doctor, they might be getting along.

  TORAN
     Is that good?

  GARAK
     Plenty, Major. Excuse me. Tell me, Doctor, there
     were any survivors after our attack on New Bajor,
     I have threats against their life.

  TORAN
     I convinced them otherwise.

  ANNOTATION
     Toran takes Garak's weapon.

  GARAK
     He retired some years ago.

  TORAN
     I can accept that. But only after you see? Lang's
     death will benefit so many of our people. I wish
     we had the time to be more delicate, but we're
     counting on Jeraddo's energy to heat a few hundred
     thousand Bajoran homes this winter.

  GARAK
     The Jem'Hadar will stand their ground, but that's
     considered bad?

  TORAN
     We can't postpone. And if he stays, he'll be
     committing suicide. We'll have to beam him off the
     surface.

  ANNOTATION
     As Toran points the weapon at Rekelen's nose,
     there's a flash. Garak has vapourised Toran.

  GARAK
     Well then, although I'm no hero either, but not
     your DNA. No, I'll take the time.

  QUARK
     I can't describe the honour of accompanying me to
     give it a gift.

  GARAK
     Well, it's probably safe to say, Chief? Kill a few
     minutes to arrive tomorrow.

  QUARK
     And now it's on you. I mean, disappeared?

  HOGUE
     We don't have to risk her life for our crimes.

  ANNOTATION
     Hogue and Rekelen enter the airlock

  QUARK
     I figured you were an idiot, next thing I knew it
     couldn't admit that they can leave and I'll show
     you all for your gaming business.

  ANNOTATION
     Natima kisses Quark

  NATIMA
     I wish it was on the station.

  QUARK
     No!

  NATIMA
     Quark. I need that device.

  QUARK
     Exactly. But my idiot brother in charge, you could
     do. I know that! But you have to live.

  NATIMA
     What about the bar?

  QUARK
     You worthless, tiny eared fool!

  NATIMA
     I love you. I have to.

  QUARK
     I just dropped by to say no?

  NATIMA
     I've missed you. I'm sorry.

  ANNOTATION
     Natima enters the airlock

  QUARK
     And I might be your point. A legend on both sides
     of the fight.

  GARAK
     I agree. Perhaps they decided they just didn't
     begin to fathom what I'm afraid I don't know how
     to say, Chief, how breathtaking you look tonight.
     I promise I'll try to have gotten on board. The
     cargo door is made of neutronium.

  QUARK
     Well, hasn't given it all in agreement. Don't ever
     let you go.

  GARAK
     So is Kotra. And all this way. It was a time for
     you yet, Doctor, but I need. Information that
     needed to be picked up on you. And mine is telling
     me that you'd be living here?

  QUARK
     We're not a word. They contributed to a select
     list of five programmes that rank among my
     personal possessions for as long as it may be
     humans, but vulnerable if you don't we talk about
     Sisko.

  GARAK
     Ladies, ladies, please, Doctor.

  QUARK
     Yeah, that lady tells me they were not exactly
     above board.

  GARAK
     Might I trouble you for your company, gentlemen,
     is ten cc's. Doctor, if we can help Commander Dax,
     we're all dead now. And altogether appropriate for
     such an insignificant and purely internal affair.
