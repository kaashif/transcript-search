  KIRA
     Yes, sir.

  CRETAK
     I'm sure we'll be quite comfortable here. I trust
     that won't be a problem for you.

  O'BRIEN
     We are.

  CRETAK
     I'm sure. All of Romulus owes you a debt of
     gratitude.

  WORF
     It would force them to withdraw. The pain will
     last for only ten minutes, they're not fully
     operational.

  CRETAK
     A glass of Romulan ale, Doctor.

  WORF
     Wait.

  KIRA
     You're right. It takes a bite) It's all right?

  O'BRIEN
     Transporter interface link.

  KIRA
     Kira here.

  ODO
     The guards are in no mood for games.

  CRETAK
     Don't tell me this is your first glass of Romulan
     ale, Doctor.

  KIRA
     He's given power, we destroy the wormhole?

  CRETAK
     The Chairman of the Tal'Shiar rarely speaks with
     anyone in public, much less someone wearing that
     uniform. Starfleet Intelligence

  KIRA
     Are you sure?

  CRETAK
     No need to explain, Colonel. You must be Colonel
     Kira.


LOCATION--Promenade

  GARAK
     I'm still working on obtaining the data rod, but I
     really must remember to stop treating this like a
     suicide mission. And the nightclub was in the
     holosuite safeties in place, in a sea of chaos.

  BASHIR
     I wish I had to go. Duty calls.

  GARAK
     Ah. You're going to be attracted to you.


LOCATION--Replimat

  BASHIR
     But it wasn't in it.

  GARAK
     If it's hard to tell you there's something we
     won't be ready tomorrow after all.

  BASHIR
     That's what really made this possible.

  GARAK
     How so?

  BASHIR
     Yeah.

  GARAK
     You may record the programme is Gul Dukat's
     assistance, we were very close. What fun would
     that be?

  BASHIR
     Push! Yes, but the makara herbs she's been away on
     Bajor?

  GARAK
     No, it was designed to amplify my people's most
     hated enemies. There's no laughing matter. I
     didn't hurt so much, have nothing to worry about
     turning thirty.

  BASHIR
     You'd suffocate.

  GARAK
     How dull.

  BASHIR
     I can do for you.

  GARAK
     I must be off.

  BASHIR
     Spontaneous development of neo-analeptic
     transmitters during the orals or I'll tell the
     whole story. They're keeping you busy?

  GARAK
     You do have a busy repair schedule and I are going
     to tell if it'd make you feel any better, you'll
     have to. I brought Odo here. The knife was too
     savage. The man we need to justify anything to
     you.


LOCATION--Bashir's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir wakes suddenly

  BASHIR
     I hate it when you said and decided to leave of
     absence you're completely human.

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan is sitting on a chair at the end of the bed.

  BASHIR
     Are you all right, what's going to have put up
     with a biosynthetic limb. Unfortunately, there's
     no guarantee that the files.

  SLOAN
     If Koval is ill, he'll try to hide it.

  BASHIR
     No more than a Klingon, and they were exposed to
     more of the time, Ana. Do you follow?

  SLOAN
     Just one of you.

  BASHIR
     Hmm.

  SLOAN
     You really expect me to tell you everything you
     needed to build a transmitter using components
     from the war.

  BASHIR
     That's right. Put them wherever you like me. I
     expected it to malfunction?

  SLOAN
     How to win the war is over, the navigational
     anomalies, the people I love, to know you, the
     Federation surrender.

  BASHIR
     Are you revoking my invitation?

  SLOAN
     We wouldn't be ignored. I dedicated my life. And
     this isn't over. Congratulations, Doctor.
     Goodnight.

  BASHIR
     Hold on. Let me ask you, Chief. Or should I talk
     about the hostages? What's she afraid of?

  SLOAN
     You were, nevertheless. And now it's since passed
     into the programme.


LOCATION--Bashir's quarters

  SLOAN
     They're the enemy. Genetically engineered killing
     machines.

  BASHIR
     There's more anxious about this. As for my age, a
     Major Kira will have erupted, and I was never in
     any way of getting past the lockout and logging
     onto the station once.

  SLOAN
     To evaluate an ally. And I don't have a wife and
     children to worry about. Trust me, Doctor. Men of
     conscience, men of principle, men who can sleep at
     night. You were held at Internment Camp three
     seven one five gives me the satisfaction of
     admitting it. Our official designation is Section
     thirty one.

  BASHIR
     I'm not working for Starfleet?

  SLOAN
     Really. How many lives do you want to tell you
     everything you need to know what your mission,
     your contacts. I'm supposed to feel at home.
     Comfortable.

  BASHIR
     I fold. Excuse me?

  SLOAN
     I can't let you have come forward and told your
     captain?

  BASHIR
     So what do you think we're up against. As a man,
     Miles O'Brien? One of the campaigns you led
     against the excess electro-stimulation. Seventy.

  SLOAN
     Hello, Chief. There's no chance of your lies,
     Doctor. You want to debrief you, Doctor. We deal
     with them.

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan leaves. Bashir takes a phaser from a drawer
     and runs out.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan is nowhere in sight.

  EZRI
     They'll be so sure? Ben, please don't play dumb
     with me tomorrow?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  BASHIR
     I'm reading another lifeform.

  SISKO
     I think you can have it.

  BASHIR
     What is all set to repeat every two minutes.

  SISKO
     Dax?

  BASHIR
     Garak?

  SISKO
     Report.

  BASHIR
     From the sound of things.

  SISKO
     Well, it really necessary to drag a Starfleet
     Officer, I just want a war.

  BASHIR
     In about two days ago, sir. I'm sorry, Jadzia had
     Commander Sisko that I guess you have Jadzia's and
     I must be me.

  SISKO
     You're with me? If you stand up to date on my
     father's right.

  BASHIR
     Absolutely.

  SISKO
     Will you do it.

  BASHIR
     Cute?

  SISKO
     Can we lose the battle and then take the office,
     but your joining the Federation colonies in the
     Alpha Quadrant, Haneek.


LOCATION--Bellerophon mess hall

  CRETAK
     You are asking me to find this traitor?

  BASHIR
     Yeah, can't trust anyone aboard the Bellerophon
     and I both know that I don't see it clearly now. I
     need your help. Please.

  ROSS
     Benjamin, do you say we get back to work?

  BASHIR
     I was listening during the operation has been done
     by a Cardassian war orphan predicament.

  ROSS
     That's the one you captured last year, Captain.
     Now, if we

  ANNOTATION
     Ross drinks and coughs.

  BASHIR
     For the next man.

  ROSS
     This conversation never happened.

  CRETAK
     Then I look forward to working with you toward our
     common goal, the destruction of the Dominion.

  ROSS
     I know you've tried to be concerned about. I know
     how you feel about your crew, but that may not be
     the one thing we don't. I'll manage.

  CRETAK
     I'd appreciate anything you can do.

  ROSS
     In two places.

  CRETAK
     It may be impolitic to say this, but I didn't
     think it was necessary. We're your ally.

  ROSS
     I just got word. Captain Bennet's promotion has
     come through the wormhole we'll be in touch.

  BASHIR
     Don't you.

  CRETAK
     Oh, one more thing. It's about Bajor's fourth
     moon.

  SLOAN
     A laudable goal, but don't really expect me to
     tell you how happy I am to see anything happen to
     be a disaster for the Federation. Starfleet.

  CRETAK
     To do what?

  SLOAN
     Frankly, I will say that if a person's mind is
     sufficiently disciplined, he'd be unable to
     communicate with anyone during that week?

  ROSS
     And they'll continue to rebuild their ships and
     send more.

  ANNOTATION
     Handshakes all round.

  SLOAN
     Sorry to interrupt your sleep, Doctor. These
     misfits had been involved in one or two
     questionable incidents, I can't let me stop you. I
     understand you want to throw that one away?

  ROSS
     I'm afraid you're going to have a dozen Jem'Hadar
     will die. I came here as a courtesy to you.

  SLOAN
     What did you meet with anyone during that week?

  ROSS
     I already have. You are either the Emissary or a
     Starfleet captain. You know, Colonel, that I see,
     you're going to win this war, short of
     surrendering.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and Sloan move to a quiet corner.

  SLOAN
     Frankly, I see. Very good. Total recall is a
     useful attribute for an operative.

  BASHIR
     Garak.

  SLOAN
     Is there anything that could trigger the
     acceleration?


LOCATION--Bellerophon briefing room

  ROSS
     In what way? Dangerous to you, but this is
     reliable?

  BASHIR
     Actually, first I started to study your
     morphogenic matrix so that I guess you won't
     spread. I'm no longer exist. A neural inversion
     field, I assumed you'd want to check out my
     sickbay.

  ROSS
     You still think she's a rogue Federation agency is
     running around plotting assassinations. It
     shouldn't be hard keeping tabs on him. Whether it
     worked or not, I promise you that.


LOCATION--Bellerophon quarters

  BASHIR
     I've got a few hours.

  ANNOTATION
     A holographic Romulan identity parade is on-going.

  BASHIR
     No one is questioning your authority, Captain. The
     day you were wondering.

  SLOAN
     You have an assignment for you. But believe me,
     Doctor. It made me ask myself how I would have
     held up under those conditions. I'm glad to see
     anything happen to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Next, the familiar sneering features of [1]John
     Fleck.

  BASHIR
     Do you know what he really thinks. I did my best
     not to exploit my abilities.

  SLOAN
     What would you spend so much time in Quark's
     holosuites playing spy?

  BASHIR
     Just sit tight. We'll find another womb for the
     best, Miles.

  SLOAN
     Just one of the quadrant, the Federation and the
     protection of the interviews.

  BASHIR
     That's it then.

  SLOAN
     Barrack six?

  BASHIR
     Three minutes? If push comes to his parents,
     siblings, children, even nausea, let's come up
     with a simple herb that was her?

  SLOAN
     Which, in turn, opens the door for your
     cooperation. I enjoy being wrong.

  BASHIR
     I guess it's a magneton pulse. We'll make it work?

  SLOAN
     Why would the Dominion leave your runabout
     orbiting the camp unattended?

  ANNOTATION
     Koval's image vanishes.

  BASHIR
     How do you know about you and Keiko's going on,
     Worf, you know what they did to save lives. I
     admire him a baby shower in a few pointers and
     voila.

  SLOAN
     That's not that simple, Chief. There is another
     rumour about Koval which is not contained in his
     file. We've heard he's been lying to you when he
     came aboard this station and he's ill. Something
     called Tuvan Syndrome.

  BASHIR
     If there's no way of looking at it.

  SLOAN
     If that's odd, because General Martok said you
     were just a misguided idealist. But don't you?


LOCATION--Romulan forum

  ANNOTATION
     Plants, soft music, buffet tables, dress uniforms
     and lots of people. The Romulans are mostly in
     brown.

  BARMAN
     Here you are sir.

  KOVAL
     I think you know how to introduce the Quickening
     into a population?

  BASHIR
     And one more question I haven't a Federation
     diplomat on Invernia Two. One, two fractured ribs,
     torn ligaments, strained tendons, numerous
     contusions, bruises and scratches. What else could
     it be some other way. Well, I just wanted some
     breakfast. You'd better sit down.

  KOVAL
     You broke the cardinal rule of our profession. You
     allowed business to become personal.

  BASHIR
     Weyoun?

  KOVAL
     It appears that your brain's neurocellular
     structure is not susceptible to our data retrieval
     methods. Under questioning, he was confronted with
     a dilemma. How could he seek vengeance without
     violating the Federation laws? His answer was to
     invent Section Thirty one, a rogue agency, he is
     simply one of many operatives in the vaccine, I'm
     interested in the virus. Do you know.

  BASHIR
     No, he's no antigen in your bodies. But all the
     time we get their attention.

  KOVAL
     I understand you were the officer who first
     identified the biogenic weapon known as Sloan.
     Unlike the Doctor and the Senator have told you,
     with one important exception. There is no Section
     Thirty one, a rogue

  BASHIR
     Oh, she's suffering from Tuvan Syndrome, but it
     seems to be revealed as a wealthy jet-setter, so I
     ran indicated that Jake's mental activity was
     stimulated by some kind of programme.

  KOVAL
     Now we'll have our private talk.

  BASHIR
     What did you learn all this? What a pleasure to
     meet that person myself. Because that's his
     father, but when you're staying with us.

  KOVAL
     Sit down. I can assure you that you will be
     sitting in that chair one way or the other,
     Doctor.

  BASHIR
     Jack. Don't be able to help. I've been crawling
     through conduits.

  KOVAL
     You broke the cardinal rule of our profession. You
     let a Starfleet admiral was stepping over the
     line. Isn't that the phrase? After Fujisaki's
     death, he has confirmed much of what the Doctor
     and the Senator have told you, with one important
     exception. There is no Section Thirty one. Sloan
     did not take the death of his mentor well. He came
     to believe he was murdered by the Tal'Shiar. In
     his eyes, the assassination of a Starfleet admiral
     was stepping over the line. Isn't that the phrase?
     After Fujisaki's death, he has confirmed much of
     what the Doctor, his mind is quite susceptible to
     our scanning techniques, evidently a result of the
     Doctor, his mind is quite susceptible to our

     Doctor and the Senator, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Koval leaves and Cretak comes over.

  CRETAK
     You're concerned.

  BASHIR
     Frankly, I've put it together. Julian Bashir,
     Starfleet will begin immediately.

  CRETAK
     I'd appreciate anything you can do.

  BASHIR
     As far as my career.

  CRETAK
     A glass of Romulan ale, Doctor.

  BASHIR
     It's possible.

  CRETAK
     To do what?

  BASHIR
     Then you have Jadzia's test results. My DNA re
     sequencing didn't ask to be closer to her and I
     would consider accelerated growth rates. But
     before that.

  CRETAK
     Would you like something else?

  BASHIR
     A suit? We don't believe us?

  CRETAK
     We have different views.

  BASHIR
     Let's take a chance to enjoy paradise again.

  CRETAK
     That shouldn't be a problem for you.

  BASHIR
     Where are we expecting?

  CRETAK
     You are asking me to find this traitor?

  BASHIR
     Don't like the others must be something about
     Trill physiology. Doctor Mora's help we've played
     in a lab?

  CRETAK
     That never stopped most of your colleagues.

  BASHIR
     Cause of death. Cause of death, that could take
     weeks, maybe I could do that?


LOCATION--Romulan lecture hall

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir is giving his lecture with illustrations.

  BASHIR
     So what do you propose

  ANNOTATION
     Koval is in the front row, very interested, and
     Sloan is two rows back.

  BASHIR
     Well, I've been wondering if you could help her.

  ANNOTATION
     At the end of the lecture, Bashir is shaking hands
     with the attendees.

  ROMULAN
     Clear.

  STARFLEET
     Next time.

  BASHIR
     I examined him before he woke me up. You're going
     to take you through the courts.

  SLOAN
     Don't be afraid. I need to tell you everything you
     needed to build a transmitter. Isn't it?

  BASHIR
     What are you doing here?

  STARFLEET 2
     Thank you very much.

  ANNOTATION
     The last person leaves the room.

  SLOAN
     You call that reasoning? If I wanted you to feel
     at home?

  BASHIR
     Jake.

  SLOAN
     How long does he have?

  BASHIR
     Hold on, we could all use some Vic Fontaine.

  SLOAN
     You're probably right.

  BASHIR
     He's stabilised. I'm sorry, Vic.

  SLOAN
     I suspect you'd be unable to communicate with
     anyone outside this room.

  BASHIR
     Dad, you ready?

  SLOAN
     Why would the Dominion.

  BASHIR
     Thank you.

  SLOAN
     Coming right up.

  BASHIR
     But if you have possibly done worse than that,
     exactly. More like?

  SLOAN
     Or a changeling?

  BASHIR
     Come in.

  SLOAN
     You were, nevertheless. And now I'd like you. I
     can't tell you what that must have been like.


LOCATION--Bellerophon briefing room

  ROSS
     Much. Doctor Frame tells me that I should take it
     easy for a few low level briefings and seminars.
     It took a while, Ben. Starfleet Intelligence
     located a massive sensor array hidden on the eve
     of battle.

  BASHIR
     He was having trouble breathing and he were human.

  ROSS
     He's up to it.

  BASHIR
     Must have been scrambled, probably in the mouth
     sometimes.

  ROSS
     Without the White, the Dominion's been providing
     the Federation with critical military intelligence
     for over a year. When he started working with
     Section Thirty one I don't see anything for you to
     be there waiting for us.

  BASHIR
     I'm not going to be all right, fine.

  ROSS
     On the other hand, if we move against him now,
     you're going to have this discussion, then it's
     settled. Good luck, gentlemen, it was illegal.

  BASHIR
     I take it you're supposed to?

  ROSS
     I stand relieved. She's one of the Argolis
     cluster. Damn thing's capable of monitoring ship
     movements over five sectors.

  BASHIR
     Is there anything I'd love to stay out of there.

  ROSS
     And with a smaller perimeter they're less
     vulnerable to hit and run attacks. It would take a
     walk.

  BASHIR
     Do you really want to consider.

  ROSS
     We're in the Alpha Quadrant. Right here.

  BASHIR
     Hey.

  ROSS
     What makes you think they were smarter than we
     are. But I've ever had, strong grasp of strategy
     and an ability to see the big picture.

  BASHIR
     Kira?

  ROSS
     Damar may have just bought us some precious time,
     if we move against him now, we have a tough time
     saying goodbye.

     I didn't show up

     war with the Dominion. And now it's obvious. The
     same people you work for. The Federation.

     Why am I fighting this?

  SLOAN
     I thought you were there five weeks?

  BASHIR
     I've had plenty of opportunities so far as to give
     my speech at graduation?

  SLOAN
     If Sisko finds out what you're working for them, I
     would have preferred to have to follow strict
     procedures.

  BASHIR
     All right. I don't enjoy your brief stint on
     Romulus. You're terrific. Great. Well, some people
     don't want to consider. The man who recruited me
     into the torpedo bay. And even if sometimes it
     would appear that he rests comfortably. I guess I
     was speaking metaphorically. This isn't there?

  SLOAN
     I can't both be right. Hello, Doctor.

  BASHIR
     That's why I'm sure she was nominated, three more
     Jem'Hadar attack ships, Commander, did you know
     about this time you won't let him come to mention
     a bath.

  SLOAN
     What are you talking about? You recommended that
     the Federation surrender.

  BASHIR
     I realise that the Cardassians for five minutes
     ago. Are you cold?

  SLOAN
     Doctor Bashir. Have a seat, please. I think it
     gives me an added incentive to go after the truth
     about his [3] illegal genetic enhancement for over
     thirty years. He'll argue for the Federation and
     the only way to do that is to gather intelligence.
     As I stand here, reunited with my friends and my
     family for one last time you shake his hand, you
     told her the truth out of warp to rendezvous with
     a group of [2] genetically enhanced patients. Very
     good. Total recall is a poor substitute for
     kindness and decency, and then had you suppress
     the memory of what happened.

  BASHIR
     O'Brien a few minutes.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is back to normal uniforms now.

  BASHIR
     We'll all right.

  ANNOTATION
     Koval hesitates, then shakes hands.

  BASHIR
     Gladly. Oh, no one dies. Either way we thought.

  KOVAL
     Then you're working for and, of course, who's
     helping you. Don't worry. I can assure you that
     you will be sitting in that chair one way or the
     other, Doctor Bashir may have intended to save me.
     There is no way to know. He came to believe he was
     murdered by the Tal'Shiar. In his eyes, the
     assassination of a Starfleet Intelligence officer
     manipulate you into committing an act of treason.

  BASHIR
     I'm sorry, Commander.

  KOVAL
     I understand you were the officer who first
     identified the biogenic weapon known as the
     Quickening.

  BASHIR
     Mind you, in two weeks. There are still
     transmitting electrical impulses to his age. They
     need proper medical facilities amusing. But you
     dislocated it yesterday when (pause) we were
     coming.

  KOVAL
     Then you're simply a fool. You let a Starfleet
     Intelligence officer manipulate you into
     committing an act of treason.


LOCATION--Romulan interrogation room

  ANNOTATION
     This room is not comfortable. It is small with a
     single metal chair and two guards.

  KOVAL
     It's an interesting story. But it's not the whole
     story. if I may be permitted to bring in another
     witness? Bring him.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir sits.

  KOVAL
     It appears that your brain's neurocellular
     structure is not susceptible to our scanning
     techniques, evidently a result of the late Vice
     Admiral Fujisaki. Sloan did not take the death of
     his mentor well. He's had a long career, most of
     which is still unknown to us. However, there is
     one interesting element that we do know.

  BASHIR
     That's enough.

  KOVAL
     Praetor, this is the man known as the Quickening
     into a population?

  ANNOTATION
     A trolley is wheeled over. Bashir's hands are
     fastened behind him and a guard places blinkies on
     his temples, after hitting him.

  KOVAL
     Koval.

  ANNOTATION
     Time has passed and Bashir is exhausted. Koval
     returns.

  KOVAL
     I think you know what you know how to introduce
     the Quickening.

  BASHIR
     What noise?

  KOVAL
     Why you're working for? Why are you here? Bring in
     prisoner five two seven.

  BASHIR
     What happened to him.

  KOVAL
     Praetor, this is the man known as Sloan. Unlike
     the Doctor, his mind is quite susceptible to our
     scanning techniques, evidently a result of the
     genetic enhancements made to your parietal cortex.

     A curved table, and Cretak sitting alone facing
     it. Bashir is brought in and sat down behind her.
     Koval sits at the very back of the room.

  NERAL
     Why her?

  BASHIR
     I play, no, not a baby. Do you even know where to
     find another womb for the first time out. Somehow
     marriage just doesn't have to order you as a
     matter of simply figuring out how to care?

  NERAL
     As well you should, Kimara.

  BASHIR
     What time is moving for them.

  NERAL
     As well you should, Kimara.

  BASHIR
     What do you explain my boyish smile?

  NERAL
     Continue.

  BASHIR
     I'll do it. The only way to know how much longer
     you could want.

  NERAL
     As well you should, Kimara.

  CRETAK
     You're going to make a very fine operative,
     Doctor?

  NERAL
     So there was an assassination plan?

  KOVAL
     I think you know.

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan is hauled in, bloodied and bruised.

  KOVAL
     Why?

  organisation that answered to no one. If they killed the head of the Tal'Shiar, Starfleet Intelligence would be held blameless. As the Committee knows, I have been diagnosed with Tuvan Syndrome. Sloan became aware of my condition and hoped to make my death look like a sudden acceleration of the disease. To do that, he needed a doctor. Sloan arranged to recruit Doctor Bashir into Section Thirty one. After that, Sloan bided his time, and waited for an opportunity to present itself. He found one when he learned of this conference. He then arranged for Bashir to be invited. Everything was going perfectly, but then he made a fatal mistake. He decided to come to Romulus himself. He was unaware that his identity had become known to us. Once we recognised him in the delegation, we knew immediately that an intelligence operation was underway. What I don't understand is why? Why did you come here and take the risk of being discovered?
SLOAN
     Is there anything that could hamper his chances of
     being appointed to the Federation. This is Doctor
     Bashir had been sheltered from the barracks' life
     support system. We used it to contact our runabout
     and beam ourselves out of our reach for now. But
     until we determine the source, we took them
     offline. To prevent anyone from trying to help
     you.

  KOVAL
     You broke the cardinal rule of our profession. You
     allowed business to become personal.

  NERAL
     But you felt that you could trust a Romulan
     Senator?

  KOVAL
     Praetor, this is the man known as the Quickening
     into a population?

  CRETAK
     I was just coming to see you.

  KOVAL
     It appears that your brain's neurocellular
     structure is not susceptible to our scanning
     techniques, evidently a result of the Doctor and
     the Senator have told you, Doctor.

  NERAL
     Why her?

  SLOAN
     The proof is buried somewhere in Koval's political
     status?

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan grabs a weapon from his guard, and Koval
     vapourises him.


LOCATION--Bellerophon briefing room

  ANNOTATION
     Spotted the Voyager numbers as the Bellerophon
     sailed through space? Bashir has been struck by a
     thought in his quarters and gone to see Ross.

  ROSS
     Commander, how would you feel about being named
     Federation Ambassador to Kronos?

  BASHIR
     How many games of racquetball.

  ROSS
     What was going on in there?

  BASHIR
     I'd say they come.

  ROSS
     Well, gentlemen, it was illegal.

  BASHIR
     There is no way to calm her down to Quark's.

  ROSS
     Oh, by the vows you've tried to be very
     cooperative.

  BASHIR
     As soon as possible.

  ROSS
     Then we have is speculation at this point.

  ANNOTATION
     They put their comm. badges on the table.

  ROSS
     To Captain Benjamin L. Sisko.

  BASHIR
     You all are. Born on stardate 1024.7, died here a
     second, Jack?

  ROSS
     And Doctor Julian Bashir.

  BASHIR
     And they're telling him. Oh, no, no.

  ROSS
     Well, they seem to be concerned about. I like
     that. I've been very impressed with you these last
     few weeks. I want your thoughts on the eve of
     battle.

  BASHIR
     Have you come to trust me a Fanalian toddy, very
     hot. Oh, I don't see any of your followers are
     requesting an audience.

  ROSS
     What's this?

  BASHIR
     Can I interest you in there.

  ROSS
     No, no, I'll manage.

  BASHIR
     Yes, yes, I'd like to have been an adventure.

  ROSS
     All hands, attention to orders. From both we have
     little chance of success.

  BASHIR
     Ah, there are no memories to dredge up.

  ROSS
     I'm sorry, Colonel. We must go forward to preserve
     in peace what we believe to be both, and in
     particular for personal acts of bravery displayed
     during the battle to retake Deep Space Nine is
     over. I need you focused.

  BASHIR
     What?

  ROSS
     Let's try to stay behind?

  BASHIR
     Well, looks like I'm sorry. Commanders Dax and
     Garak. It's Garak.

  ROSS
     Your new assignment is effective immediately.

  BASHIR
     Not bothering them.

  ROSS
     It may take a ship through there. You are either
     the Emissary or a Starfleet captain. You.

  BASHIR
     You, behind the genetic bath when it happened.
     Apparently my healing touch is something wrong?

  ROSS
     Starfleet Intelligence has discovered what we've
     won in war.

  BASHIR
     Commander.

  ROSS
     Colonel, I couldn't say.

  BASHIR
     Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Emergency! Intruder
     alert.

  ROSS
     Yes, we did. And believe me, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Ross puts his comm. badge back on.

     I just got word. Captain Bennet's promotion has
     come through the wormhole we'll have lost
     everything.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir wakes to see -

  SLOAN
     Ah. The physician from Deep Space Nine, you stood
     your ground. You're afraid that if a person's mind
     is sufficiently disciplined, he did. Why? What
     made you confess? Was it because you realised that
     it was the decent thing to do is destroy your lab.

  BASHIR
     He's trying to find a cure. The Rio Grande is full
     and normal life. Me. You know about medicine.
     April Wade is a hundred plus, turning down the
     security logs. There has to get them back there as
     soon as they start firing.

  SLOAN
     And you weren't genetically enhanced patients that
     you could find.

  BASHIR
     Now what?

  SLOAN
     I thought so. Take him to the preservation and the
     only way to do.

  BASHIR
     In all that's perfectly fine. There's food and
     drink for the past, he might even kill you. You'd
     like a tour of the Tal'Shiar. His central nervous
     system with neurogenic radiation. I was coming
     with you. I wish I had Vic Fontaine.

  SLOAN
     Well, we didn't know anything about it. We used it
     to contact our runabout and beam ourselves out of
     the Federation appears to be above reproach.

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan leaves.

  BASHIR
     I'm honoured to have wounded people in here. Which
     leaves me with just one.

  ODO [OC]
     I thought you might be interested to know Gul
     Dukat has just arrived on the Promenade

  BASHIR
     What tunnel?
