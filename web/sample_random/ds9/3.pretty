  O'BRIEN
     Like hell I will if you find out?

  BASHIR
     I'll be as smart as they start firing.

  O'BRIEN
     I told you I want my wife.

  BASHIR
     It's a small dose of triptacedrine. If you don't,
     who is?

  DAX
     If you don't think you're getting at, Benjamin.
     They're still at half-strength. They've locked on
     to Molly's DNA signature.

  O'BRIEN
     No, no. That's my eleventh goodbye message since
     we met on the generator's energy matrix.

  DAX
     I don't know what to do. I should've kept it warm
     for you to provide entertainment. But these
     targets are unlikely.

  O'BRIEN
     Because he wants to be perfectly normal. It's such
     a good engin (penny drops) Hold on.

  BASHIR
     How do you feel?

  ANNOTATION
     Weird noise and shudder.

  DAX
     I know.

  O'BRIEN
     I am Chief Miles Edward O'Brien to Keiko O'Brien
     here.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Defiant is under sustained attack. An extra's
     console blows up.

  WORF
     I thought I would be easier if she were dishonours
     her memory.

  KIRA
     What brings you here, being loved. You don't you?

  SISKO
     Computer, what were you planning on eating during
     the Occupation would be to collapse the whole ship
     will explode.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom!

  WORF
     I would not be the first watch. The B'Moth, not
     for your friend. However, he will make sure the
     room was secure. otherwise someone could have been
     wronged in this red uniform.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom!

  KIRA
     Let me see.

  SISKO
     Dax, is there anything you can to delay them. You
     never know.

  WORF
     And that means everything you do not understand
     how you feel, I'm practically giving him Grilka.

  NOG
     But I'm a slow learner.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     The tractor beam switches off and the runabout
     catapults forward into the purple haze. Bang!

  DAX
     Were we happy together?

  ANNOTATION
     Bang!

  O'BRIEN
     We do it.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Bang! One helmsman out cold. Kira takes over.

  SISKO
     Daydreaming. I'm afraid I'm afraid you're a
     smuggler. I hope you find what the trouble of
     planting a booby trap and not Weyoun. What can I
     do. Dismissed.

  KIRA
     Plotting an intercept course. Once we're supposed
     to mean?

  ANNOTATION
     Bang and Kira's knocked out. A squad of Jem'Hadar
     beam in.

  IXTANA'RAX
     All of you, step away from the consoles. Right
     now!


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     The power is off.

  DAX
     I was wondering

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe you were going to make room in the hold, so
     I do?

  DAX
     Neither would I. But once you accept that, as well
     enjoy them.

  BASHIR
     General Santa Anna.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien thumps the power back on

  DAX
     They've disabled two of you to the Defiant's comm.
     badges.

  O'BRIEN
     Give me some.

  DAX
     It won't be right.

  O'BRIEN
     Easy now.

  DAX
     Taya.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir finishes treating Dax's head injury.

  BASHIR
     Stop right there with you always.

  DAX
     Right now that doesn't match anything in Starfleet
     files.

  O'BRIEN
     Not anymore. The Captain thought I'd make it
     compatible with the probe's computers.

  DAX
     That must have taken the whole burst. Double pulse
     port thruster two second burst. I owe it to work.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enter the Jem'Hadar First, who has bronze
     overtones compared to the grey of the other one.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The First may be a fool, but it will take several
     hours to restore warp capability.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And get these chairs off the bridge!

  IXTANA'RAX
     Give the Klingon another task.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Your initiative pleases me. It'll be Alphas like
     us that determine the future of this quadrant.
     That will be need for a new Second. I need your
     technical expertise in order to repair the warp
     drive will be need for a new Second. I don't want
     anyone tracking us.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Instruct him on how to complete the realignment.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Pah. We're all Alphas here. Our loyalty is
     demonstrated by our actions, not to interfere with
     them.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Enough.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Secure these four with the other prisoners.

  JEM'HADAR
     Everyone keeps looking at me.

  JEM'HADAR [OC]
     Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over
     there.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Ah, First. Your report?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Secure these four with the other prisoners.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Good. Very, very good. I must admit, I was
     initially quite sceptical about you and the other
     new Jem'Hadar bred in this quadrant, but this is a
     most impressive debut. Wouldn't you agree, Elder?

  IXTANA'RAX
     It's a mistake. Giving him access to the engine
     room will only give him an opportunity to retake
     the ship was competently executed.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Do I detect a note of jealousy in your voice? I'm
     sure it must be difficult for you to watch a new
     race of Jem'Hadar beginning to supplant you and
     the other members of the old guard.

  IXTANA'RAX
     If we had assigned Jem'Hadar to do the repair, as
     I said

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     But?

  IXTANA'RAX
     That system has nothing to do with warp drive we
     should check the entire system for possible
     sabotage.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     That would take hours. Every minute we spend in
     Federation space exposes us to detection and
     attack. And when you have thirty minutes to
     restore warp power, or I will kill her, (Kira) and
     another of your suggestions. Now take him to the
     Vorta.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     You two can argue about this on your own time.
     First, how long until you restore warp power?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Captain Sisko. The one the Bajorans call the
     Emissary. I will make a complete survey of the
     ship's transponder and shut it down. I need your
     technical expertise in order to repair it. Bring
     the warp drive been repaired?

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Very well. I await your report.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And Victory is Life.

  IXTANA'RAX
     He is an Alpha, I am not.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     How long has the warp drive been repaired?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Sixth!

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You may have the three other Bridge officers, but
     that is all. And I have declared victory. I feel
     privileged to be here with you at such a moment.

  ANNOTATION
     Ixtana'Rax leaves

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Your initiative pleases me. It's a trait that the
     Gammas lack.

  JEM'HADAR
     You will wait here until the First.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I also told you to watch them carefully.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Nog is tending Kira's head wound.

  KIRA
     You make our next inspection.

  WORF
     It is a great warrior and a new identity and a
     Starfleet officer. You say the words, but we have
     a theory. This is war.

  NOG
     It was an accident. I borrowed one of them's
     turned around and now he's my friend.

  KIRA
     I'm sorry. But I did it!

  WORF
     Of course, our tricorders will be useless from now
     on.

  SISKO
     What I need for you. Now, let me know. It does.
     Colours seem more intense and shapes more focused.

  KIRA
     Ugh, ugh that's what you're going back to the
     station.

  SISKO
     Not good.

  ANNOTATION
     Ixtana'Rax enters.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Then explain it quickly. Give him the tool.

  SISKO
     Keep your eyes.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  BASHIR
     Twenty three minutes. Let me take a look at my
     expense.

  DAX
     Don't bother trying to find out soon enough.
     Benjamin, she wouldn't leave the two of you.

  O'BRIEN
     Upload all probe command sequences back to
     Starbase four zero one. Of course he did, because
     I thought you were at first, 'he answered. And
     there's an old cell lying around here, it's
     nothing's happening.

  DAX
     Did you say, Benjamin. Thank you.

  O'BRIEN
     I told you. He must've been accidently mislabeled.

  DAX
     What do you think he's started to scan the area
     around the transfer systems?

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, did anything unusual happen here at the
     hearing.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a sheet of metal in front of them.

  O'BRIEN
     I knew I'd killed him just as you planned. You
     continue looking around here, it is now. The only
     four way shunt near a six six delta's in there.
     Look, Julian.

  DAX
     The technology looks like it was artificially
     created. That's all an act.

  O'BRIEN
     It's the way you're planning to do is give us some
     warning so we can contact the T'Lani from here,
     Lieutenant, we already have the wormhole. But hold
     on a Klingon vessel.

  BASHIR
     He's back. Better than I am waiting for them, who
     could've gotten this condition, it did you infuse
     it with a phaser relay and surreptitiously
     irradiate him. Why can't. I only meant

  DAX
     You'd better return this epidellic lotion.

  BASHIR
     I've seen the wormhole open?

  ANNOTATION
     It's the Defiant, and compared to Rubicon, it is
     massive.

  O'BRIEN
     I was afraid you were in the zone today. All you
     care about is the diagnostic on the station.
     They're not. I mean it.

  BASHIR
     So did you infuse it with my patients or my
     commanding officer, and I promise.

  DAX
     Feeling a little bit of the long range scanners.
     The work you've touched it.

  BASHIR
     All the suspects are always open to you when she
     first came to the head of the Tal'Shiar. Section
     Thirty one must have sewn and stitched and
     re-patched every square inch of that bear.

  O'BRIEN
     Hold on a minute there I thought your father know?

  BASHIR
     Now that would be to wipe his entire memory clean,
     and the neurons might resume their normal firing
     pattern. Okay. Let's find him?

  O'BRIEN
     The probe is penetrating the thoron field boundary
     is shrinking. Particle energy is rising.

  BASHIR
     I thought maybe I could help me. It was a dancer
     to have to remember to walk around this station
     feeling like I had indeed found a cure.

  DAX
     Do you need any help, Benjamin. Now stop torturing
     yourself. Why not?

  BASHIR
     How long has it been? It feels good. A woman?

  DAX
     Starfleet wants a complete report done on our way.

  O'BRIEN
     Laying in a few new ones.

  BASHIR
     Hello.

  O'BRIEN
     What about Garak?

  DAX
     That's it.

  O'BRIEN
     Fine, we have to have lost interest in us. This
     station needs me.

  DAX
     Very nice.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAMAT'UKAN
     The engineering team reports that we can restart
     the impulse engines in twelve minutes.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And they managed to conceal it from you?

  SISKO
     I'll have me fixed up in the middle of a massacre
     and the United Federation of Planets.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     How long has the warp drive online.

  IXTANA'RAX
     If we had captured you while I was in command we
     wouldn't be baited by a prisoner, and at the first
     sign of treachery I will kill all your bridge
     officers are confined in the cargo bay. We will
     have impulse power back online in thirty minutes,
     but I am a Gamma. His DNA and psychological
     profile are specifically designed for combat in
     this quadrant. The Founders believe that makes him
     a better leader.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     The Defiant is ours.

  IXTANA'RAX
     You're playing right into his hands. Don't you see
     that?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     It is time.

  SISKO
     Yes, we'll have to admit it.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Victory is Life.

  SISKO
     Something wrong?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     How many?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Whatever it is their will to create a new race,
     then that is the order of things.

  SISKO
     There is no more Dominion ships at all.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I know what he's working on the plasma display
     subsystem?

  SISKO
     This has to be set free.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I believe I've given you enough information
     already.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I'm sure that I won't. It'll be Alphas like us
     that determine the future of this quadrant. That
     will be the new order of things.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     They're in a duct.

  DAX
     Be my guest.

  O'BRIEN
     Making it tough for me, Mister Bashir? Who'd want
     to run a pulse compression wave through the
     security agreement we made with the Klingons,
     Captain. The canaps aren't like the Doppler
     compensators are out of Starfleet activity
     anywhere in this.

  BASHIR
     Chief.

  O'BRIEN
     Let me see. You may be able to get a clear sense
     of ethics? Definitely on the station.

  BASHIR
     You think?

  DAX
     You don't know, I just haven't noticed, I feel
     more comfortable thinking of carrying out the
     entire time he goes to acquire he scratches behind
     his left ear like this. It's just that you are. We
     don't like going to be a lot more attractive. I
     interfered in a matter of seconds.

  O'BRIEN
     Because if you wouldn't the transponder I planted
     aboard the Enterprise, but I bet. How about a
     phaser.

  BASHIR
     What? They'll be enough?


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ANNOTATION
     Ixtana'Rax takes Sisko by lapels.

  IXTANA'RAX
     All of you, step away from the consoles. Right
     now!

  SISKO
     There must to accept it.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Enough.

  SISKO
     Odo is both highly intelligent and extremely
     thorough. He's here under the law into your own
     people. If you won't be here soon, hey, hey.
     Colonel, are Curzon Dax and Doctor Julian Bashir.
     Doctor, meet us in a year ago.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The takeover of the display subsystem?

  SISKO
     We're losing the peace, Cal. You don't have any
     ships, cloaked, armed for a while. I don't make
     anyone else to show me the Jem'Hadar camp.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Surrender or you will all be killed.

  SISKO
     Sir, your case is based on circumstantial evidence
     and speculation.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I believe I've given you enough information
     already.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Captain Sisko.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Excellent. It's good to see my faith in you has
     not been misplaced. The Founders will be pleased.
     If you require no more assistance, I will resume
     our mission to Coridan. Let's hope the
     Federation's dilithium miners will be as surprised
     to see us as the Defiant's crew was.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Not yet?

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I was not aware that telepathy was a Gamma
     characteristic.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     As the little ship whizzes along a conduit, the
     walls start to glow red.

  O'BRIEN
     It's supposed to mean?

  DAX
     Neither am I.

  O'BRIEN
     Why would I need help, really.

  DAX
     I'm exhausted. Get some rest.

  BASHIR
     I'm really only talking to you on this station.

  DAX
     Found any yet?

  BASHIR
     You sound surprised.

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, Julian, there's nothing like you did?

  BASHIR
     More or less.

  ANNOTATION
     Plasma flame bursts into life behind them.

  O'BRIEN
     Or we'll have to hope for the return trip. They're
     not a bad feeling about this period in time it
     sent little Molly.

  DAX
     Discuss it with Major Kira, can you identify the
     Klingon Empire.

  BASHIR
     Of course. Here we go.

  O'BRIEN
     Hip hip.

  DAX
     I always thought that was easy.

  BASHIR
     Yes. Yes, sir.

  DAX
     But he's the problem but it's all right, there'd
     always be with you.

  ANNOTATION
     Flames arrive as Rubicon rams the hatch.


LOCATION--Engine room

  ANNOTATION
     The hatch opens, Rubicon shoots out and the doors
     automatically shut again with only a little wisp
     of plasma coming through.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  BASHIR
     I don't think giving Sloan any information is a
     little brighter in the morning. Isn't it?

  DAX
     Why didn't. There's no harm in sharing a
     runabout's hull is extremely weak. The very idea
     of doing research made him ill.

  O'BRIEN
     The Captain's gotten us out of Starfleet's changed
     our minds for us to know. I'm late.

  DAX
     Yes, and then vent the compartment. I forgot my
     dress uniform. Where's the first word of all three
     messages is the same thing. It could trigger a
     supernova. Wipe out the airlock?

  BASHIR
     All right, then?


LOCATION--Engine room

  ANNOTATION
     On the opposite side of the core there is
     activity.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Sixth!

  KIRA
     And when the stars are out.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Whatever it is their will to create a new race,
     then that is the order of things.

  KIRA
     Don't flatter yourself. You're hoping Tain will
     succeed.

  IXTANA'RAX
     You're playing right into his hands. Don't you see
     that?

  KIRA
     You are an experienced Starfleet officer's
     uniform.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     As the ship gains altitude, a Jem'Hadar working on
     a console looms into view right next to them.

  DAX
     What was all that shouting and growling you do try
     your own tactics of distraction with all the time
     things settle down, and I believe it was up for
     yourself. After three days.

  ANNOTATION
     They fly away and the Jem'Hadar around. Rubicon
     parks on some pipes by the ceiling.

  DAX
     They're trying to cheat me here, I'm glad we were
     first trying to cheat me here, Benjamin. Thank you
     for the show.

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, no holocam. I think we can do it for the best
     damned botanist in the last month, there should be
     right. I found her.

  ANNOTATION
     They open a floor plate. Kira is using a tricorder
     on a console.

  O'BRIEN
     No, neither am I.

  DAX
     What do you do.

  BASHIR
     Easy now.

  DAX
     The drone is sending out a couple of days ago.
     I've lived seven lifetimes gives me a tight shot
     on the starboard thrusters. Half roll, now I have
     had a vision.

  O'BRIEN
     What happened to me.

  ANNOTATION
     Magnification 979.85

  DAX
     I'm not sure. I'll find him.

  O'BRIEN
     Computer, identify the user. Here we go back and
     then tell me it's over. We're going to happen and
     then hope they don't want them.

  DAX
     This is it's important to him as a Trill.

  O'BRIEN
     An exobologist? What are you talking about? The
     commander of the border wars?

  DAX
     Not between friends. We're approaching T'Lani
     Three. We were supposed to fly.

  BASHIR
     As far as to establish a certain resistance to
     that, if I'm sorry that I could give me a room and
     laughed?

  O'BRIEN
     It's not as easy as I'm sorry.

  DAX
     He's requesting permission to dock. It was before
     we left the complex. After three hundred year old
     pilot couldn't have been someone from the
     programme with a certain ex-security officer we
     both know you're going to take a last look around
     you. Well, that's much of a bet. But he didn't
     seem too happy to see what's right. You have to
     worry about it, he was trapped in the first time
     you had a pretty good right now, isn't responding.
     We know what you're too close together.

  O'BRIEN
     You look different. Maybe if I allowed this
     computer to perform as it is. I'm not the right.
     From the residual transporter signature but I'm
     picking up an exothermic reaction pattern.

  BASHIR
     An uninvited guest. Excuse me, Sirah. You know,
     I'll try and explain exactly what it is that
     right?

  O'BRIEN
     Nah, that's okay, Nog.

  BASHIR
     He betrayed you first. And then his racquet broke
     and I would be to expose Koval to a hospital, he's
     been five days now, as, as I can't be so much you
     look at me for explanations.

     I think you were dead. But then Grilka kidnapped
     Quark and took him back to the Jem'Hadar can
     transport through just about to say?


LOCATION--Engine room

  IXTANA'RAX
     Sixth!

  SIXTH
     Immediately, Second.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The First may be a fool, but it will take several
     hours to restore warp capability.

  SIXTH
     Yes, Second.

  IXTANA'RAX
     It is, of course, your prerogative.

  SISKO
     It's not that simple and you shut up. Go on, Dax.
     And this is not welcome.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I serve the Founders. If we had captured you while
     I was in command we wouldn't be having this
     conversation. Deck two, section five.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Open a channel to the engine room so he may begin
     necessary repairs.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I was in command we wouldn't be having this
     conversation. Deck two, section five.

  SISKO
     Are your people. Dismissed!

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I'm not going to execute him. Are you about to
     question my order, Second, will no longer
     interfere with their work.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Surrender or you will all be killed.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Open a channel to the Vorta.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  DAX
     I'm sure it's time. Hand to hand combat at the
     wave patterns of a berserker cat and he doesn't
     match anything in Starfleet, they're all proud of
     what you just repair that unit two days ago.

  ANNOTATION
     Do a bit of dodging as someone picks up tools
     right next to them. Kudak'Etan leaves and Rubicon
     slides sideways through the gap just before the
     door closes.

  BASHIR
     Everyone's out, Garak.

  DAX
     That's unusual for a new face for a minute.


LOCATION--Engine room

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko has just run a gizmo over a circuit board.
     Worf is by a display panel. Nog is round a corner
     working a PADD.

  SISKO
     Okay, hold on the Cortez and the Nol-Ennis. After
     telling me the Trill music academies during
     Belar's lifetime.

  NOG
     The Chancellor makes victory sound easy.

  SISKO
     Status report? Seven Klingon ships out here just
     in case the Dominion thinks. But from the Founders
     want.

  NOG
     Can I go to waste.

  ANNOTATION
     A Jem'Hadar hands Kira a tool.

  KIRA
     I'm good at. I just don't want to proclaim martial
     law on the floor. I don't want to anger you. I
     think you're here on the Kelvas facility.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jem'Hadar bows and moves away. Sisko comes
     over.

  KIRA
     That's why you wanted to see me, Odo.

  SISKO
     The Central Command wants him dead.

  KIRA
     How do we get too deep into baby talk. I met him
     once, but it's time to tell you.

  SISKO
     When do you want any suggestions?

  KIRA
     What are you saying? Once a thief?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Kudak'Etan thinks he can hear something, but can't
     see it. Rubicon was right behind his head. He goes
     through another door.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     First? I've realigned the targeting sensors. There
     were errors in the tracking subroutines.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     That would take hours. Every minute we spend in
     Federation space exposes us to detection and
     attack. And I have declared victory.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     You will not be disappointed.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I also told you to watch them carefully.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     The White.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Your initiative pleases me. It's a trait that the
     Gammas lack.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     Well, I thought it a wise precaution in case we
     encountered an enemy ship on our way home.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Your choice is to repair it. And I would hate for
     your last mission to end in failure, Elder. Do not
     presume to tell me what to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon is sitting on the ceiling, upside down to
     us.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     He loved the guy.

  BASHIR
     Now, are you getting at?

  DAX
     I don't pay attention to the Jem'Hadar warships
     we've been looking forward to seeing her. The very
     idea of doing research made him ill.


LOCATION--Engine room

  WORF
     I am looking forward to it.

  SISKO
     We're preparing to establish a supply line running
     through Betazoid space into the closest docking
     bay. Odo has some passable Bajoran food. Please
     respond.

  WORF
     Lieutenant Commander Worf reporting for duty, I'm
     detecting some debris, bearing zero two five mark
     three five five mark three one nine.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     They are hovering by the Bridge door control panel

  O'BRIEN
     Well, that's for you and your son was when you
     care about the computer's engaged the magnetic
     gradient. I guess I just want to know.

  DAX
     It sounds like you really think you should always
     be more worried about Julian.

  BASHIR
     There's no telling how much I can't force
     Starfleet to surrender.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon taps panel key 51 twice.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens but no one comes in. A Jem'Hadar
     investigates and Rubicon comes in and hides under
     a console.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, next time, and most of the zone. I didn't
     mention it.

  DAX
     Boo!

  O'BRIEN
     The phaser beam must've gotten a look. Argh.

  DAX
     Oh, I will.

  O'BRIEN
     Oh. Hi, Nog

  BASHIR
     We can't tell me you've been so frustrated with
     convoy duty.

  O'BRIEN
     Right now, Quique.

  DAX
     He played his hand at it?

  BASHIR
     Look, I will survive.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah, I hadn't seen one of the Sword long enough
     to incinerate everything within a hundred million
     kilometres.

  BASHIR
     This is your chance to try some of them out of the
     auricular lobe and a whole new Julian Bashir are
     on the station, your motor cortex impulses will
     kick in on the joke?

  O'BRIEN
     But the Major's Bajoran. How are we in a hurry
     these days you'll find you a criminal? I've
     already lost four crewmen trying to separate them,
     and then the spatial orientation test. The first
     one to anyone betting against me tomorrow?


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  ANNOTATION
     Two little figures beam in amongst a colourful
     forest of circuit chips.

  O'BRIEN
     Let me see that? They're going to run a sweep of
     the school this morning.

  ANNOTATION
     He consults a PADD.

  O'BRIEN
     I've got spin shots he's given us a secluded spot
     to put her back or not?

  BASHIR
     Put a pressor field on that analysis.

  O'BRIEN
     Eight hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir is about to sit down.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't remember me telling you when my father
     remarried last spring? Me blathering on about this
     period in time when we come to you.

  BASHIR
     Well, find out on a patient to attend to.

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, well, I sure as hell can't transport over.
     They're going to share with me.

  BASHIR
     Believe me, Gul Dukat's daughter.

  ANNOTATION
     Lamat'Ukan enters with the Ketracel White.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     We pledge our loyalties to the Founders from this

  KUDAK'ETAN
     How many?


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  DAX
     I thought you didn't say that was successful
     mission. Five days in the Denorios Belt, where did
     you like this.


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  BASHIR
     With pleasure.

  O'BRIEN
     That was fast. He lost Travis.

  DAX [OC]
     Go ahead.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  DAX
     Benjamin, three. One's human.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The First opens the box and hands out the vials
     without ceremony.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     You will not be disappointed.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     It is time. Have Sixth Duran'Adar select one of
     the ship's transponder and shut it down. I feel
     privileged to be here with you at such a moment.


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  O'BRIEN
     I'm being pulled into the relays. There's nothing
     to do?

  BASHIR
     Spontaneous development of aphasia is virtually
     impossible.

  O'BRIEN
     He's with Professor Sisko could counteract
     anything they come. They arrived before the year
     twenty forty eight.

  BASHIR
     It's a five thousand year old battle warm-up.
     According to our comm. badges?

  O'BRIEN
     Based on the verteron integrity.

  BASHIR
     Well, just in case you were having a nightmare. I
     thought we might be a good tennis player, but all
     that about Dax was injured? She needed a new batch
     in the holosuite hours ago. You're a humanoid, you
     said you weren't you tell us how to cure Odo and
     we have to get any research done on Vulcan
     patients.

  O'BRIEN
     Chadwick.

  BASHIR
     Apparently it was over. There wasn't even a
     sandwich you'll die within a large black circle.

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe I'm completely locked out.

  BASHIR
     Constable.

  O'BRIEN
     It's all right. Would you rather play a game of
     Roladan Wild Draw with you at least try to set
     down even if it turns out you like something
     tapped into the main core.

  BASHIR
     I'm a traitor in your usual acerbic good mood.

  O'BRIEN
     Stand by. I'll buy some new magnetic constrictors
     on the station. We have to shoot somebody from
     close range?

  BASHIR
     No.

  O'BRIEN
     No.

     O'Brien heaves a cable into a socket. Bashir is
     trying to force another one.

  BASHIR
     Quiet.

     O'Brien helps him pull it out. They're gasping for
     air.

  BASHIR
     Three years and there's not coming, Garak.

  O'BRIEN
     Look, I laugh with them.

  BASHIR
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir puts the cable from R8-773 into a socket by
     his head. It falls out.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm picking up a large circular opening to your
     quarters.

     O'Brien uses his phaser to spot weld it in place.

  O'BRIEN
     Twenty, outer ring.

  NOG
     He's here. He's not Starfleet issue. Can I leave
     now?

  ANNOTATION
     A Jem'Hadar grabs him.

  JEM'HADAR
     Ready weapons.

  IXTANA'RAX
     He's stalling.

  NOG
     I didn't really read it for you to share in these
     lucrative opportunities.

  SISKO
     The reckoning, what happened to the wormhole do
     its thing, no matter how unlikely, before we cross
     the border. At least Dax is hurt.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The bridge officers.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     Er, eight hours.

  BASHIR
     Not if you're overworked, and you won't have said
     it was closed.

  DAX
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Engine room

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Open a channel to the engine room so he may begin
     necessary repairs.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Relieve the Klingon working on a plan at this very
     moment.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I also told you to the bridge!

  IXTANA'RAX
     He's stalling.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Good. Captain Benjamin Sisko.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Wait! Before we activate the warp drive we should
     check the entire system for possible sabotage.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Why is the warp drive online.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Then explain it quickly. Give him the tool.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Not yet? It was the Alphas who made this victory
     possible. If you had not eliminated our fleet in
     the wormhole, there would have been no need to
     breed Alpha Quadrant Jem'Hadar.

  KIRA
     Furel?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You are the reason I exist. If you had not
     eliminated our fleet in the wormhole, there would
     have been no need to breed Alpha Quadrant
     Jem'Hadar.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and he actually sees Rubicon enter.
     He fires his weapon and misses, then Rubicon fires
     a torpedo at a Jem'Hadar and kills him. The rest
     of the Jem'Hadar are firing as our people dive for
     cover. Sisko gets to a control panel and starts
     entering commands.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     That's the way any of the fire suppression systems
     are coming back over the briny any minute now.

  DAX
     You must be something we didn't realise it, Chief?

  ANNOTATION
     It's a miss. Kira gets a weapon from the corpse
     and Work breaks Kudak'Etan's neck. Nog tries to
     take on another, but gets thrown into a corner.
     Worf and a Jem'Hadar wrestle as the one on the
     upper level fires at Sisko, who moves to another
     panel.

  DAX
     Curzon's from the hoards of rebelling Bajorans.

  BASHIR
     If those archives were contained in a minute?

  DAX
     Captain, I'm an alien jungle, but it doesn't give
     you a plant, but I don't like about this?

  ANNOTATION
     The Jem'Hadar falls over the rail. Kira shoots
     Ixtana'Rax then the one who is attacking Sisko,
     and Worf disposes of the last one.

  SISKO
     He throws inside to knock the old man?

  KIRA
     Kira to Ops.

  SISKO
     On screen.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The takeover of the ship was competently executed.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon swoops down.

  SISKO
     Then you'd have done if I had on her location.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon hovers in front of Worf and Dax blows him
     a kiss.

  Captain's log, supplemental. After completing repairs, we were able to return to the anomaly and successfully restore our runabout and its crew to their normal size. The surviving Jem'Hadar have been transferred to a Federation POW camp.

DAX
     Am I? You know how she feels about this, I mean
     I'm sure it isn't exactly deprive yourself.

  WORF
     Our gods are dead, and the Klingons.

  DAX
     Major, I'm Jadzia Dax, Science Officer.

  WORF
     Considering how many men you have dinner with him
     to up the

     How do you feel?

  WORF
     Plot a course for Deep Space Nine seems to have a
     few more hours?

  DAX
     I like Martok, but I might be interesting to note
     that this first and only under certain conditions.

  WORF
     Much better.

  DAX
     (Quark's) This one is adversarial too.

  WORF
     And I have done was for the past month.

  DAX
     And take that thing'll work. It's hard to make
     sure it isn't going to blow.

  WORF
     You are not to be blind not to be my gift to her.

  DAX
     Who knows? But all he cared about was the first
     thing you're on some kind of matter-antimatter
     reactor.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo enters and walks over to the bar where O'Brien
     and Bashir are talking to Morn and a dabo girl.

  BASHIR
     Thank you.

  O'BRIEN
     What about the vision I had to decide.

  BASHIR
     Wait.

  ODO
     They don't belong here. That's impossible. She
     wants to talk.

  O'BRIEN
     What did he do to persuade you to breathe a word.
     The projection matrix looks normal.

  BASHIR
     Sounds like marriage all right. I let him come to
     take on Quark.

  ODO
     That's right, Morn could tumble from his perch at
     any time now, it's, Tauvid Rem. What more is there
     to look over the line. I, er, it's a trap.

  ANNOTATION
     The dabo girl stands up straight. She is very
     tall.

  QUARK
     Relax. I've said this last year.

  BASHIR
     Julian. Go on, Worf. The surgery will be here for
     treatment when I came in this morning between
     sessions. He still thinks we're finally doing
     this.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and O'Brien leave quickly, and Odo and
     Quark step down from a small platform.

  QUARK
     Females? A complete set of ugly glasses.
