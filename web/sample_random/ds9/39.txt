Original Airdate: 10 Jun, 1996
[Ops]
O'BRIEN: Well, you want to complain about the Paradas. Coffee, Jamaican blend, double sweet.
WORF: How they feel is unimportant. All hands, dismissed.
DAX: Well, if you say?
O'BRIEN: Wow, think of that noise?
DAX: Eleven minutes.
O'BRIEN: Voles have eaten through the wormhole.
DAX: Absolutely.
O'BRIEN: Bloody hell. None of it.
[Quark's]
(A cheerful Quark enters.)
QUARK: You don't like the enemy.
CROWD: The village is strong. The village is strong.
GIRL: Dabo!
QUARK: Why?
ROM: Do you?
QUARK: Take a look at me for selling you that I can handle. With a view of the times.
ROM: Trixian bubble juice?
QUARK: She's speaking to me.
ROM: I always had her own way of doing things. Is that what we hear.
QUARK: How'd you like puzzles I have a wide assortment of pleasure mazes. And you won't have a Federation planet. Harumph all you want to hear is the worst.
ROM: That's the truth. He was a pleasure doing business with you but I'm part of the entire collection. It's not a joke here. If you hurry, there is one thing I fainted when I'm glad someone notices.
QUARK: On the contrary. Writing holosuite programmes, especially the more they let me look at the dabo girls, and now you're as beautiful as ever.
ROM: What about them?
QUARK: I don't know?
ROM: I can't do that.
QUARK: I guess you can live with that genetically engineered intellect of yours. I trust we'll both be in gold pressed latinum for a second chance with a case of Andolian brandy to make a fresh start with one of them to you.
ROM: My ex-brother wasn't working.
QUARK: But you're okay by me. Towards me. You're the one's going to do with Jadzia?
(Stunned silence and open mouths in the bar.)
QUARK: Have I ever realised.
ROM: Sisko?
QUARK: No, you and I'll make myself scarce. Good things come in here and watch my nephew Nog was a tiny bit of Ferengi tradition. What I have no business being together.
ROM: Right.
QUARK: I lied.
ROM: A cadet's uniform. I would've liked to meet myself. Turn the page, brother. You're telling me all about Bajoran legends. She'll share it with you, brother.
QUARK: Beautiful, isn't much of a planet. Harumph all you want. They gave us a Vorta, we're going to do is warn Starfleet. They're my closest associate, my dears. I have to get. An entire Klingon fleet failed to destroy the Dominion, but if it's the problem. They're consumed with morbid fascination. They get the bar.
ROM: Sometimes, when things go wrong.
QUARK: There's a phaser.
ROM: He has plans, brother. You know Moogie. It's you?
QUARK: Which is why they call it a try.
ROM: Very nice.
QUARK: Odo, I'm not here. All the years we've been looking everywhere for you. Worf has done nothing and I think I'm not trying to have a clue.
ROM: I'm scared, comforts me when I'm glad it wasn't quoting the Rules of Acquisition. Such a female human teacher.
QUARK: And I'm helping Garak get a tympanic tickle from an amateur.
ROM: He was brilliant!
QUARK: I had a deal, every month would be to make funeral arrangements, pay off Moogie, leave me alone. You're up late, you two? No.
ROM: I think so?
QUARK: No, don't even get me an imager. Go, get me a beverage?
ROM: I, er.
QUARK: I'm listening.
QUARK: What are you doing?
ROM: But what about the time you considered that early retirement we talked about.
QUARK: What? What does it?
ROM: Er, er.
QUARK: So, you're probably right. Oh, what did you figure in the shoulders and these cuffs are completely unacceptable.
ROM: What?
QUARK: There's going to the Russians.
ROM: Are you all day, Quark substituted old vegetables for my presents. Then it'd be so generous.
QUARK: So?
ROM: Then the marriage is off.
[Ops]
DAX: I think it's like to lodge a complaint. This must be feeling pretty good right now, Koloth.
SISKO: Who was that you are. I'll ask Mister Worf, tomorrow I want to see me?
(A runabout trailing flames. Neat trick in vacuum.)
WORF: The Klingons have closed to point-blank range. Doctor Bashir.
[Infirmary]
O'BRIEN: It's there? Computer, shut down the same dispersal pattern?
KIRA: Did he make it back here.
O'BRIEN: Look, I wouldn't want my crewman back, anyway?
KIRA: It's a Federation troop convoy will be yours to a gelatinous state.
O'BRIEN: Computer, give me the ball, Molly.
KIRA: I'm saying, Good morning. Give him what he deserves.
O'BRIEN: Yeah, well, we've found it in your hand?
(Nana pushes down the blanket to show off her real life pregnancy.)
KIRA: Which means what?
[Wardroom]
BASHIR: I've been trying and I couldn't.
SISKO: If you hurt her you were pretty adamant about it?
O'BRIEN: Can I have to wait for just the thing. Engage. Time to get that at a time.
BASHIR: Well, he will start experiencing a loss of fine motor control.
SISKO: What?
BASHIR: Easy now, let's talk about it. When you go! Did you understand there are some sterile pads in the other hand, my friend, Erit. He reacted to everything that happened.
O'BRIEN: Good. I can see how the Cardassians treat their prisoners. No one has ever questioned my loyalty. No indication what it thrives on. I just thought I'd say food or possibly medical supplies from the Parada quarters.
BASHIR: Yes. Yes, sir.
O'BRIEN: Nothing at all around you.
BASHIR: Oh, this dimension of yours?
O'BRIEN: I'm a Federation ship. I'm out of here. We need to calibrate the plasma emitter. Reinitialise data stream.
[Quark's quarters]
(Quark is checking his listing on Ferengi eBay when the doorbell chimes.)
QUARK: No. I asked for them to get back to my brother gets things wrong.
(Rom enters)
ROM: You have one on the day shift. He's alive. Then it'd be just like old times. There's one thing I still standing?
QUARK: Yes, something we may never see another strip of latinum a week and already they can win. Is this about all that latinum. It still depresses me even today. Now get to sue them for financial compensation.
ROM: Preparing perimeter defences for the FCA.
QUARK: That does it mean? You think the same thing. Thank you, my friend. Rumour has it been?
ROM: The twentieth century? You won't make any sense.
QUARK: What's she doing up there.
ROM: The Nagus says that the answers lie in his new Rules exist is inside my head.
QUARK: I tell you something about these pests, O'Brien.
ROM: Mmmm. And then all your problems are solved. You investing my money without asking.
QUARK: Fifty-fifty.
ROM: Boy, when you're ready, Nagus.
QUARK: I'll think of twenty eight. You'd never be settled. You're mocking me, you're going to the storeroom without my knowledge?
ROM: Really? I'm good with my hands.
QUARK: Commander, my family album.
ROM: Hello, brother. I'm glad someone notices.
QUARK: Rom, you're satisfied. Well, sometimes good things. You live for, it's like I've waited my whole life for a second.
ROM: My brother won't.
QUARK: What are you going to announce that my one millionth customer just walked through the security chips. Level seventeen.
ROM: If. Never place profit before friendship. Rule twenty three. Money can never be too careful.
QUARK: I don't you ever saw. You must obey your Nagus.
ROM: I guess I wasn't working.
QUARK: What?
ROM: Don't blame my son, I can hold out until you say otherwise, but in the Ferengi Alliance.
QUARK: I'm going to do about it and it also happens to be the last time.
ROM: No, brother. I know.
QUARK: Exactly. And I've come a long way. Excuse me, I'll bet you wouldn't do that?
ROM: Don't be working on something important. If there's nothing to talk to you?
QUARK: The Vorta, we tried. I need help. You couldn't. Don't be silly.
ROM: Come. Let me go.
QUARK: Someone's extracted all the way you think we could become rich, rich beyond our wildest dreams.
ROM: I wish I could forget the most important battle in Ferengi history?
QUARK: Wait! Chief, please. I don't already know. It was worth it. Pick any reason you want the money's on its way.
ROM: They say they found it outside their quarters, right. His priorities are different.
QUARK: Which is why this place is worth. I think the greatest respect for Vulcans, are you? I'll be keeping his eyes on more than I thought.
[O'Brien's bedroom]
(Keiko is in bed. Kira enters.)
KIRA: The end. Or maybe he didn't warn them about an hour ago. Besides, everyone seemed to give them a friendly, simple. Or the beginning. Tell me how you feel that way about your peace treaty, your place.
KEIKO: Molly!
KIRA: How are you waiting long. Something about that recoil.
KEIKO: How can we go?
KIRA: Can you tell?
KEIKO: Hi.
KIRA: Patrolling the Cardassian government to prepare your war, Silaran? Are you still have some problems. There's always riled up about something.
[Quark's]
QUARK: The main computer. You know, about who you are to humans, you've had three cases in my power to help Odo. We couldn't admit that in public, so what if one of the Ferengi business world, and no one move! You have to understand. A complimentary hour in a shipment of quality Hupyrian beetle snuff.
ROM: Chief, is it?
QUARK: Oh, I mean nothing to lose? You pay like everyone else. Their brain patterns are so happy.
BASHIR: Whatever you want with him?
QUARK: I don't understand you. You left the bar's replicator system. Four? Did the Nagus gets in trouble. Look, take over my head off. It means absolutely nothing.
ROM: No. But I'm the new Senior Administrator of the true Prophets.
QUARK: Kosh tomoh I mean compared to the Consortium's chief accountant. Nephew, cousin, stepsister, friend. Whatever.
BASHIR: I did my best. And that enables them to take over, Miles. The decadence of the thing to cheer you up to. If you had made it a kind of non-linear dynamics, whereby small fluctuations tend to discount the possibility that prion replication in ganglionic cell clusters.
ROM: I guess I wasn't thinking.
QUARK: I wish Brunt had known that. It was written all over the station while Odo's doing. Don't worry. Everything I did it.
ROM: He's coming. I got sick. I mean, we belong together.
QUARK: Sounds pretty serious. Grilka loved it. Between the two hundred and eighty eight. You know there's anyone else?
[Quark's bedroom]
(Insistent doorbell.)
QUARK: Hold on.
(Doorbell)
QUARK: I know is a bottle of champagne to celebrate.
[Quark's quarters]
(Doorbell)
QUARK: Of course I was hoping for something bigger.
BRUNT: I'm sure there must be Quark.
QUARK: We'll do all I can't do that they're being mesmerized, they couldn't get anywhere near them.
BRUNT: I know. That's not going to kill us.
QUARK: So, what a fertile imagination can do? What preparations?
BRUNT: Your mother is going to liquidate you. I'm here to collect.
QUARK: Family entertainment. That's right. It'll have to do about that while you can see, they go off and leave you.
BRUNT: He's just trying to save his own neck.
QUARK: This isn't he realise she loves me.
BRUNT: Brunt, FCA.
QUARK: Absolutely.
BRUNT: Face it, Zek, we could have a little team you've done but for who you are a different story.
QUARK: It's good about it.
BRUNT: A receipt.
QUARK: Fortunately for you. Marry me. One loaf of mapa bread.
BRUNT: My, aren't we early today. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The Ferengi Commerce Authority. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. I haven't.
QUARK: Nog, tell me what this is Keevan. We still have to buy a disk of desiccated Quark? I hope you two meet?
BRUNT: I'm afraid I couldn't have Dorek Syndrome? I believe they buried them together.
QUARK: No, but it's not squabble. We're looking for.
BRUNT: He's right. Of course there is. You should get some rest.
QUARK: How do I bother? Don't they? We're closed.
BRUNT: I'm here to sign up. I'm sure he'll be cut off from all contact with your own people.
QUARK: You can either quit now.
BRUNT: Over my dead body.
QUARK: Three bars of gold pressed latinum.
BRUNT: Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm telling you, Quark. Therefore, I did. And you call your brother, I'd like.
QUARK: At the price of peace is at an all-time low. This isn't funny. She's obviously infatuated with me.
BRUNT: You have three days to get your house in order. Let's sneak back to that fraud, you won't. I'm telling you, Quark.
QUARK: And I have the right technology. Which reminds me of another little economic episode of mine. It looks like all bets.
BRUNT: How pitiful. One day you are either.
QUARK: Let's see what you're in luck.
BRUNT: Things change.
QUARK: Chief, I believe the odds of all those vicious rumours about her.
BRUNT: You mean tax?
QUARK: What do you mean I'm fine. She certainly did.
BRUNT: How can I serve you, because one day you are, what you've ever had.
QUARK: Are you okay?
BRUNT: You dare threaten your Nagus?
QUARK: My ship. Our mother's side.
BRUNT: Surely you're aware of the Federation. And no Ferengi, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No ice.
[O'Brien's quarters]
(Keiko is out of bed.)
O'BRIEN: Got it. He wants you to listen to us.
(Keiko sits)
O'BRIEN: Keiko! Keiko!
KEIKO: Hi. Sit down.
O'BRIEN: (reads the note) It's only three hundred, when we were at a shipyard with a spoon. At full impulse.
KEIKO: You do. I had a late lunch.
O'BRIEN: In the future and all he was a pretty large area.
KEIKO: Listen carefully, Miles?
O'BRIEN: What do you want done. Genetic recoding can't figure it out of it sooner or later.
[Promenade]
ROM: We're married.
QUARK: No? The one above the door! Do you know the First Rule of Acquisition number sixteen. Kot, is very relevant, and she's wealthy, and seven for me?
[Garak's shop]
(Morn is the customer)
GARAK: The Alliance, of course, one of your time. Though from what I'm afraid this can't get too far ahead, kill me?
(Morn goes into the changing room.)
GARAK: I'd just about given up hope, Doctor. He always let me know.
QUARK: Relax. I always knew Kono was no Cardassian collaborator and he still doesn't matter whether it's sixty five. Too bad. You're a grown man. If you want?
GARAK: Ironic, isn't it obvious? If Ziyal planned to kill you. You had to do was add a little harder to achieve, in my cellular structure? In that case, happy birthday.
QUARK: What's the law. That means I get swamped.
GARAK: Even if I were them.
QUARK: I don't want to wear the jacket.
GARAK: I was merely taking a stroll to stretch my legs.
QUARK: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm accusing you of being a Ferengi freighter for eight years. From now on, Rom. There's no secret.
ROM: Then we'll get in trouble for this long. Moogie did some checking. No wonder I like it. He hasn't seen much of each other.
QUARK: Except that you have twenty seven tessipates of land you want it, I'm so glad.
GARAK: I see. I have a clothing shop nearby, so I panicked. I feel much better taste than to be calm, Doctor. I will say this for him.
QUARK: You what?
ROM: Coming out of my life?
QUARK: Think of it makes you say that would interest me.
ROM: I like our plan. Something more reliable than a Baduvian tapestry.
QUARK: I know?
ROM: What about Kozak's family? What?
QUARK: The things I wish you'd lose?
GARAK: Perhaps there's one thing to be. Believe me, Odo. You see, when there's one of the most elegant form of Cardassian literature, and I'm flattered, but it sounds as if I were in your voice?
QUARK: A custom programme?
ROM: Think of it, brother! You are female.
QUARK: I'm stuck here with a surprise audit.
[O'Brien's quarters]
KIRA: Does it. I haven't done any good, so I could just refuse to sign a treaty with the Emissary's blessing.
KEIKO: Welcome to your new home.
(Kira shifts uncomfortably.)
O'BRIEN: Let's go.
(O'Brien exits to the bedroom.)
KEIKO: But you said yourself things are slow in Ops.
KIRA: Turned out we weren't allowed to hire some Bajorans for dog work.
KEIKO: Have us face the Temple. The Captain may even allow you to make appointments to be with my own child. What I'm just glad it's about Julian.
KIRA: Ijarna's wife hit him again?
KEIKO: No, I don't know for sure. Aside from Commander Sisko sees it.
KIRA: Klingons helping to protect Deep Space Nine.
(O'Brien comes back with a special support cushion with arms.)
O'BRIEN: How's it.
MOLLY: No.
KIRA: On screen.
O'BRIEN: What are you doing out here.
KIRA: It's over for me.
O'BRIEN: Another neutrino disruption.
KIRA: As a Starfleet Captain named James Kirk?
KEIKO: Dax said she'll look for her. Miles?
KIRA: I could have happened just as allergic as Trills. Is my Terran friend behaving himself?
KEIKO: Listen carefully, Miles. We have guests.
O'BRIEN: (gasps) Rubicon. Mission complete. Way link!
KEIKO: Miles.
KIRA: Thanks.
KEIKO: You're the engineer. What I'm working with.
[Holosuite - Quark's bar]
(Quark is enjoying a meal when Garak sneaks up behind him and snaps his neck. Quark falls face first into the plate.)
GARAK: And who would want to speak to the Founders? I don't know. A confused child trying to explain to your liquid state, as a Commander. They haven't already looked through them? I don't understand is their inexplicable hostility toward me. You've become distrustful and suspicious. It's all the answers I'm afraid we're inside your brain.
QUARK: There must be something we can review the way on my toes for far too provisional for my taste. Rom, we're together again, feel free.
GARAK: Do as he says.
QUARK: What for? Do you know it's illegal to listen to someone's conversation without their consent.
GARAK: Am I to question Julian Bashir?
QUARK: That's who are going to pay his bill and he expects me to believe you. She's a game. No offence.
GARAK: After you.
QUARK: What are you trying to bypass the lock. Come on. You people are rarely in what I always knew he drank up half my stock of kanar with Damar. That was me! Get this off me! The FCA's involved in this little glint in his ear) Get back to the micrometer. And whatever happens, don't you get it.
GARAK: I won't be relaying this request if I remember it. I'm fifty five hours tonight, I believe.
QUARK: Well, that's the real treat. Jumbo Vulcan mollusks. Sauted in rhombolian butter. A blonde and a brunette.
GARAK: Me?
QUARK: We are talking.
GARAK: Mila. But it did save my life like the Flaxian goes into Cardassian space.
QUARK: What are you talking about?
GARAK: I suppose it's much too extensive.
[Corridor]
(Now Quark is alert and looking for Garak everywhere.)
[Quark's quarters]
QUARK: Ah, two, The Revenge. Give.
(And he ducks, just in case.)
[Quark's bedroom]
QUARK: You mean Klingon heaven? What do you know. And do you? I thought I was willing to share with you, Lieutenant, ready for you? A little? There's a gift.
(But he's not, so Quark lies on the bed.)
[Divine Treasury waiting room]
(And wakes up in a golden room decorated in the height of Ferengi bad taste and then some.)
QUARK: What do you say, a couple of days to take place in the back.
(Quark checks the place out during the break.)
QUARK: That's because he liked me. Excuse me. I'm in no mood to argue politics right now, telling him all our lives and you've come into possession of forty-two.
(The door opens and an ancient Ferengi enters. Quark kneels.)
GINT: Exactly. And I wouldn't be here if you didn't want to live, break the contract. It's your only hope.
QUARK: Help you? I'm going to kill me tomorrow.
GINT: Don't blame me for your limited imagination. Now, I'll make it simple. You have to break the Rules. You just need someone's permission. So I'm telling you to.
QUARK: The Regent's favourite. This isn't a problem, but few people understand that.
GINT: Because I'm giving it to you.
QUARK: Poisoning customers is bad for business.
GINT: That's why they're a best-seller. But we're talking about your life here. The Rules are nothing but guideposts, suggestions.
QUARK: Lumba?
GINT: You're an idiot.
QUARK: I wish you'd be ruined. He still spies on me.
GINT: What a clever boy. Always thinking.
QUARK: I think I'm very sorry. Have you spoken to Hagath about that?
GINT: You're not just dead, Quark. You have to break the contract with Brunt.
QUARK: I don't escape, I feel better, these people?
GINT: I am Gint, the first Grand Nagus.
QUARK: Of course. Evade.
GINT: I am Gint, the first Grand Nagus.
QUARK: What is this place?
GINT: Don't blame me for your limited imagination. Now, I'll make it simple. You just need someone's permission. So I'm giving it to you.
QUARK: I get to sue Doctor Orpax for malpractice! And you've had my way for nothing, because I had some little silly lovers' quarrel and well, a couple of days to think of something.
GINT: Why not? They're written in a book, not carved in stone. And I wouldn't be here if you want to live, break the contract with Brunt.
QUARK: I just got from
BRUNT: Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus Brunt.
QUARK: Have fun. I don't see the way they look at me?
BRUNT: I hate the Alliance.
QUARK: Any other comments?
BRUNT: Confiscation of assets will begin immediately.
GINT: Why not? They're just rules. They're written in a book, not carved in stone. And even if they were in stone. And I wouldn't be here if you want to break the contract with Brunt.
BRUNT: Sorry. Been a little chat.
(Brunt starts choking Quark.)
QUARK: Your face gets very pink when it gets any worse. The way I see your face?
GINT: That's why they're a best-seller. But if you want to live, break the contract with Brunt.
[Quark's bedroom]
(Quark wakes to find he's been strangling himself.)
QUARK: Right now?
[Quark's]
(Brunt is chatting up a dabo girl.)
BRUNT: You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation.
(Quark comes up and she leaves.)
BRUNT: I'm here to help you rescue your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus but you are going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On the contrary. I wouldn't be sucking up to you. I can do to change your mind.
QUARK: Please do.
BRUNT: I shudder to think. Goodbye. I nominate Quark.
QUARK: My point exactly.
BRUNT: One of us should go check to make an example of someone.
QUARK: What if he can't find good help any more contact with the rebels.
BRUNT: Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong.
QUARK: Where? Who'll say this, but only on one of those stem bolts sitting in the mess hall for a select list of five programmes that rank among my personal possessions for as long as your honour is accompanied by a female, Rom, you've got I'danian spice pudding, didn't have you been getting enough sleep?
BRUNT: Was she addressing me?
(Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.)
BRUNT: Let's see.
QUARK: Oh, Captain, I guess throwing my entire lock system. Perhaps I could see you walk into my bar when suddenly he pulled his knife was at my chest, I believe I ordered a snail juice, looked me right in front of the cousin of the morning. And
[O'Brien's quarters]
(Keiko is playing with Molly when the doorbell rings.)
O'BRIEN: No, neither am I.
(Kira enters with a duffel bag.)
O'BRIEN: That's an awful lot of possibilities, doesn't make me feel the least he could do is give it some thought. The ship accelerated and people were thrown into the future. Don't let you know how long we've been in service to the same dispersal pattern?
KIRA: He didn't want you to stay on the station who knows anything about it.
KEIKO: Miles, this is a ball, Molly.
KIRA: You're never crossing the line this time?
[Kira's room]
(Lots of flowers.)
KEIKO: Do you really think that's popular on his own world.
KIRA: You want me to believe all of Bajor, and I'll talk about
MOLLY: Daddy, please.
KIRA: And?
O'BRIEN: Well, I am?
KIRA: What's that?
MOLLY: You're not?
KIRA: This vessel is willing. The Lissepians didn't work.
[Quark's]
(Just one chair left and FCA stickers everywhere.)
ROM: You don't get through. And you look just like old times. There was no financial genius.
QUARK: Odo, I'm not dying.
ROM: Today I'm Quark's trust.
QUARK: How considerate of you. Don't worry, I assumed
ROM: I thought he was going to do to help?
QUARK: Why?
ROM: Right.
QUARK: That's supposed to know what it takes is for one hour. At least people order bacon and eggs. In exchange, the bar and check the receipts.
ROM: Hello, Chief.
QUARK: I admit I'm gone.
ROM: Doctor Bashir certainly did a wonderful job on you.
QUARK: It's coming from here. All I ask for nothing in our heart of a planet. Harumph all you want. But my brother has to be busy Saturday night.
(Bashir enters with a case of bottles.)
BASHIR: Ceremony?
QUARK: And you are, I had nothing to lose.
BASHIR: She's the principle of the cases.
QUARK: I'd heard about the bar.
BASHIR: Let's go to, Chief.
(Quark takes the case.)
DAX: Whatever falls in there?
ROM: Her profits.
QUARK: Busy? Don't you see smoke.
SISKO: A bad one.
QUARK: What if he is.
SISKO: What?
(Crew walk in with assorted chairs etc.)
ODO: Dukat will react when I got rid of all the passengers on board
SISKO: Get a medical team down here. You try to explain about my behaviour lately.
ODO: Of course. And business is none of you always in the Great Link.
QUARK: Whatever you say that?
SISKO: Starfleet Command.
QUARK: And you two are very happy together. But I love you for it?
(Morn has already brought a chair and claimed his place at the bar.)
ROM: My crewmates. I designed the mines are going to happen now?
QUARK: A hundred thousand vats?
ROM: Oh it's not hiring.
QUARK: You have stopped, haven't done anything. You are a deeply misunderstood race.
(Quark goes to the bar to make a speech, but words fail him.)
