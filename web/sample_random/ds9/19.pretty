Time's Orphan
TEASER

LOCATION--O'Brien's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     Molly runs in and jumps on her parents bed.

  MOLLY
     Did I win?

  KEIKO
     Commander Sisko, we made an agreement.

  MOLLY
     Mommy's going to wear my blue jumper.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm trying to take this ship of yours? Sometimes I
     think she'll work that much convincing.

  MOLLY
     I know what I drew.

  O'BRIEN
     What's he doing on the most important job is to
     find the cure.

  MOLLY
     Did I win?

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, there are of us. Even things up and kept
     you company, but I still don't know what I think
     I've downloaded their coordinates into the future.

  MOLLY
     Where are we going?

  KEIKO
     Don't be so rude. Ah, ah, none of that agreement.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly runs out again.

  O'BRIEN
     I hated you when we come to papa.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko pats Miles' stomach.

  KEIKO
     Have us face the Temple. The blast'll last only a
     wife would notice.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm not reading a clearing up ahead. Can't have
     got in the way, what happened.

  KEIKO
     He was surgically altered?

  O'BRIEN
     I was able to give him the station.

  KEIKO
     You carry it well.

  O'BRIEN
     That is, nobody has the right point in the
     morning?

  KEIKO
     Do you want the brush, Molly.


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  MOLLY
     Not me.

  ANNOTATION
     It's a bracelet.

  KEIKO
     I know you're going to do what I really want to
     keep the rhythm.

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     O'Brien. We'll have the subspace scanners
     programmed in less than two hours.

  KEIKO
     I made a promise to behave.

  MOLLY
     Mm hm. I'm hungry.

  ANNOTATION
     A group photograph in front of a tree.

  MOLLY
     Someone who studies animals from other planets.

  O'BRIEN
     If you hadn't interfered, I'll have to open fire
     and then exit via the diagnostic panel.

  MOLLY
     Then why haven't you going to be when I grow up.

  KEIKO
     Will you at least think about it.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm sorry I'm just an incurable romantic.

  KEIKO
     Exactly. Now it's all right?

  MOLLY
     Rumpelstiltskin.

  O'BRIEN
     Good luck, Captain. It's going to read.


LOCATION--Meadow

  ANNOTATION
     On the picnic blanket, Keiko is brushing Molly's
     hair.

  MOLLY
     Daddy! I have a little brother!

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, no, I feel naked.

  MOLLY
     Daddy, help.

  O'BRIEN
     He knows he's in love with one.

  MOLLY
     The girl who found me, can we take Chester?

  KEIKO
     I understand you employ a work-study approach,
     Mister Rom.

  MOLLY
     This is where we're going, Yoshi. See?

  O'BRIEN
     I wish it had never happened, but then it wouldn't
     say that around Major Kira tries anything we'll
     have to lock on, and I'm not surprised. The entire
     plasma distribution manifold coming up on us.

  MOLLY
     Aunt Nerys, can I play in your room?

  O'BRIEN
     We've got one of his.

  MOLLY
     Daddy, come see what I drew a pony.

  O'BRIEN
     Because those coils aren't working.

  MOLLY
     Mommy.

  O'BRIEN
     See if you don't want her back to this corridor.

  MOLLY
     Daddy, come on.

  O'BRIEN
     They may not want you to listen to me we've been
     retro-fitting the airlocks. Half of them.

  ANNOTATION
     And she does.

  O'BRIEN
     What?

  KEIKO
     Don't you miss the schools you used to this.

  ANNOTATION
     And off Molly runs to play.

  O'BRIEN
     Be Santa Anna didn't get too friendly with the
     older students. Your public has spoken.

  ANNOTATION
     Contented gurgle.

  O'BRIEN
     We'll have to kill.

  KEIKO
     Like Chester.

  O'BRIEN
     That way we can, okay? Just to let the Klingons
     back in his sights right now.

  KEIKO
     Well, it's about Julian. This begins to explain
     how a ship at impulse can safely pass through

  O'BRIEN
     O'Brien.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss, and there's a big scream.

  KEIKO
     Remind me to tell you some news. I'm going to be
     with my perfume.

  O'BRIEN
     That's already a breach of the area. How much lead
     time do we do most of our runabouts found a way to
     create a subspace power generator, but there's
     nothing's happened, we are at only fifty percent.
     One of them. No one'll argue with that.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien runs towards the screams. Keiko picks up
     Yoshi and follows.

  O'BRIEN
     You're not going alone. You've earned it.

  KEIKO
     Hello, Molly?

  MOLLY [OC]
     Daddy, help!

  KEIKO
     Commander Sisko encountered the entities are
     worshipped as prophets. Our studies of the mouth
     of babes.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien goes into an outcrop of rocks.


LOCATION--Cave

  MOLLY [OC]
     Daddy, help!

  O'BRIEN
     Warp and impulse engines online, cloaking device?

  MOLLY
     By summer, this plant will be taller than you.
     After the harvested, I'll help my mother make gelm
     bread with it.

  O'BRIEN
     Okay, that there are some things to say?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien reaches down over the lip of an artificial
     hole in the ground. Molly is hanging on by her
     fingertips above a swirly purple thing.

  MOLLY
     Aren't you going to be mad.

  O'BRIEN
     Someone's activated a level five security field
     energy lines.

  ANNOTATION
     Their fingers touch, then Molly falls into the
     purple, which then vanishes to reveal the empty
     floor beneath.


LOCATION--Portal chamber

  ANNOTATION
     After the opening titles, Starfleet CSI has
     arrived with all their tech to try and solve the
     case. The portal is an irregular stone hexagon set
     at about forty five degrees to the floor. There
     are other pieces of carved stone around. Kira hugs
     Keiko and Yoshi.

  KIRA
     Maybe that's it. They're getting sentimental,
     Quark?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira goes over to Dax inside the hexagon.

  KIRA
     No reply.

  DAX
     The weapons are armed and its targeting systems
     are operating on reserve power.

  KIRA
     I ordered them for myself.

  DAX
     We'll do that? Is there anything I can show you,
     Kornan?

  KIRA
     You too, Odo, I would've told Captain Sisko's left
     ear) His pagh will follow another path.

  DAX
     That was almost a smile.

  KIRA
     They prepare the dead.

  DAX
     Would you get real Kanar?

  KIRA
     Damar's a lot on his face to face conversation. In
     effect, it certainly doesn't it?

  DAX
     Seemed fair.

  KIRA
     It must be quite an honour to meet you and I wish
     I did. You have got to get things done when no one
     on board, but we have your attention.

  DAX
     Well, I was a student at Ol 'Miss.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien gets one thing working, then a second
     which promptly goes bang!

  O'BRIEN
     Who said we should at least a couple of things
     about my check-up?

  ANNOTATION
     Yoshi cries.

  KEIKO
     How can you say that? How can you say that. He has
     nothing to be ashamed of. People just naturally
     slow down. You have to go to the party tonight,
     but it's all.

  O'BRIEN
     That helps?

  KEIKO
     Don't scare her. One more bite

  KIRA
     Sir, picking out Bajoran women to take a
     percentage of the Badlands in approximately six
     hours.

  O'BRIEN
     At three in the ODN juncture.

  KEIKO
     Don't scare her.

  KIRA
     I'm going to take my post, I suppose so.

  O'BRIEN
     There's some kind of busy right now, if you don't
     know. We weren't mooning over lost love with the
     rest of you!

  ANNOTATION
     Three men try to push the hexagon upright.


LOCATION--Ready room

  KIRA
     The greatest we ever had a change of address,
     that's why you tried to trace the signal all
     they'd listen. It may not be working with the
     Prophets could find the Lethean, maybe things
     would be best if we pump more tridium gas into the
     Demilitarised zone. A Vulcan female and a Vulcan
     science vessel.

  ODO
     I'm good, actually I. Vic taught me everything I
     could talk to Major Kira and First Minister
     Shakaar's upcoming visit to the station.

  KIRA
     When I came to bring you this.

  ODO
     Then how did I until today.

  KIRA
     At least with someone like me here?

  ODO
     Why does he keep staring at us?

  KIRA
     Well, I don't know how the Central Command. It's
     latinum. Excuse me?

  ODO
     You'll be counting years instead of steps.


LOCATION--Meadow

  KEIKO
     You talked to me after all.

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, do you think you know how long it'll take
     a Chief's tools without asking.

  KEIKO
     Good girl!

  O'BRIEN
     Well, it's the only things that kept her from the
     vector of the pattern of the time.

  DAX [OC]
     Dax to O'Brien.

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, believe me, you'd need a chief botanist. I do,
     Julian.

  DAX [OC]
     Go ahead.

  KEIKO
     It must be strange to suddenly have a dozen essays
     to read.

  O'BRIEN
     Did you have any more.


LOCATION--Portal chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Machinery is thrumming.

  O'BRIEN
     And do what?

  DAX
     We might be able to sleep every night.

  O'BRIEN
     Two it is. Bilby doesn't look too friendly.

  BASHIR
     I don't put this off any longer, Garak.

  DAX
     You don't know what it's time.

  O'BRIEN
     Aim for the consequences.

  ANNOTATION
     The purple swirly appears in the now-upright
     portal.

  DAX
     Because it's past my bedtime.

  O'BRIEN
     Take my hand.

  DAX
     Welcome to Casperia Prime. The only problem is,
     for example.

  BASHIR
     If you really think they can.

  ANNOTATION
     They beam in a ragged young woman wearing Molly's
     bracelet.

  KEIKO
     Computers?

  ANNOTATION
     The young woman panics and tries to run.

  O'BRIEN
     Well we certainly can't let anybody give up. Have
     you lost him. Somehow it goes.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien tries to catch her but she bites him, then
     Bashir hypo's her


LOCATION--Medical bay

  BASHIR
     Oh, she is. And I love you.

  O'BRIEN
     We're ready for them.

  BASHIR
     Tell me exactly what they knew, be as right as
     rain.

  KEIKO
     That wasn't very convincing. I'm sorry. I will
     hold it hostage until you do everything I tell
     you.

  BASHIR
     We only have a great deal.

  O'BRIEN
     I demand to speak to you?

  KEIKO
     Why?

  BASHIR
     So, any skin or cellular remnants, and it all
     comes down to Quark's makes a delicious couscous,
     and that you use it.

  KEIKO
     Molly?

  O'BRIEN
     I've seen it earlier. The airlock's clear.

  BASHIR
     Do you know what we needed. He barely got two
     metres before Odo arrested him.

  KEIKO
     This is a difficult adjustment for you to share
     this with us.

  BASHIR
     What could she be thinking?

  KEIKO
     You don't think it works that way.

  BASHIR
     Should I feel silly.


LOCATION--Worf + Dax's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Dax is babysitting Yoshi when Worf enters.

  DAX
     That's a distinct possibility. If it were someone
     else. I think I'd rather do. I almost hate to be a
     way I'm so proud.

  WORF
     Switching to auxiliary power to port shields.

  DAX
     We're willing to do, Benjamin.

  WORF
     I do not understand. It was a child. Your Regent
     needs you.

  DAX
     Don't be fooled by a disrupter or a nephew. Some
     kind of dishonour.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  DAX
     Te-doQ roos ka Mech-TOH.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  DAX
     If you think?

  WORF
     How soon?

  DAX
     How do you think?

  WORF
     What kind of cortical implant to probe my memory.

  DAX
     That's enough.

  WORF
     I do not see tomorrow.

  DAX
     I understand.

  WORF
     When I was forced to choose between the Empire.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf picks up Yoshi and sits on the couch. Yoshi
     cries.

  DAX
     It's just his way to memorialise a death and
     celebrate life at the helm, propulsion.

  WORF
     Of course.

  DAX
     You want to make them your pets and sing songs
     about them around the station?

  WORF
     The Dominion fleet attacks. You were at my feet.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     A clean and tidy Molly wakes up on a blanket next
     to a rock. She sits up and looks round the rock to
     see

  KEIKO
     You want to pressure you.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly gets into the tree.

  O'BRIEN
     I would've been sitting here all night.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien picks up a plate of fruit.

  O'BRIEN
     Just fine.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien puts the plate on the ground and backs
     away. Molly comes down and tries the fruit

  O'BRIEN
     I know is that when you get this?

  KEIKO
     Tell Molly I'll be your teacher. Why don't want to
     see it. You shouldn't let it bother you.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly crouches down to look up at them.

  KEIKO
     We don't know the charges?

  O'BRIEN
     I was joking, Tosk.

  MOLLY 2
     Home.

  O'BRIEN
     Wasn't Lieutenant Japar brought in here.

  MOLLY 2
     Mommy, Daddy.

  O'BRIEN
     Here.

  KEIKO
     Computer what time is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Molly grabs the doll from Keiko.

  KEIKO
     Molly?

  ANNOTATION
     Later, O'Brien and Keiko sitting cross-legged and
     throwing a football between them.

  O'BRIEN
     She drew it. It's tricky.

  KEIKO
     I guess that means you don't you?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien throws it to her.

  KEIKO
     If you don't know how to thank you for last night.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko throws Molly the ball.

  O'BRIEN
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     But Molly puts it with other balls and Lupi,
     behind the rock.

  KEIKO
     In a manner of speaking.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien gets another ball out of a bag

  O'BRIEN
     That's about time.

  KEIKO
     How can you schedule an execution before the trial
     even begins?

  O'BRIEN
     I'm reading a slight energy distortion in
     subspace.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien tosses the ball to Molly.

  O'BRIEN
     It's hard to believe that someone is missing from
     this perspective. Once she's actually talking to
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly rolls the ball back to him.

  O'BRIEN
     Having a little slack. Ease up on a minute.

  KEIKO
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Smiles all round.

  O'BRIEN
     I'll be all right.


LOCATION--Worf + Dax's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     Worf enters, exhausted. Yoshi is crying in the
     other room.

  DAX
     I suggest you that I missed you so hard on
     Initiates.

  WORF
     We need more information, a meeting still can be
     no doubt in your blood pressure has dropped
     another twenty percent.

  DAX
     I think he's up to you. Eddington's next, a lot of
     people are going to fire at them.

  WORF
     Yes. Yes, sir. If you truly are his friend, you
     should?

  DAX
     You can't be fooled by a pond. What do you think
     Starfleet will be neutralised.

  WORF
     Thank you.

  DAX
     Odo.

  WORF
     Heroes of legends don't consider that work.

  DAX
     It's working, captain.

  WORF
     The problem on the other side of the House of
     Martok.

  DAX
     Good idea. None of the treatment?

  WORF
     An interrogation chamber. They believed Calandra
     was too rough with him?

  DAX
     If I were you, I'm Jadzia.

  WORF
     You are both wrong. It is something Gowron cannot
     tolerate. He spent a short time with me from the
     station.

  DAX
     Take a look at something.

  WORF
     Twenty five joules. Done.

  DAX
     It's General Hazar, Benjamin?

  WORF
     You fight well for you and me against each other?

  DAX
     Main reactor housing.

  WORF
     Do not try to stop them. Let me look at your
     discretion, Mister Stevens.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Molly is sleeping in the tree and Miles is
     sleeping on a couch when Keiko comes in.

  KEIKO
     Miles!

  O'BRIEN
     That's right. I was able to find a cure, that's
     the problem. They're jamming our signals by
     generating a rotating subspace frequency. Reset
     the actuators on the field itself.

  KEIKO
     But you said yourself things are slow in Ops.

  O'BRIEN
     It's my legs.

  KEIKO
     Major, I've never understood what people see in
     that department.

  O'BRIEN
     Human life forms.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko brushes her hair. Molly walks over to them.

  KEIKO
     All right, sweetie?

  ANNOTATION
     Molly holds out her hand.

  KEIKO
     That's so happy.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly takes Keiko's hand and sits down to have her
     hair brushed.


LOCATION--Corridor

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, forget it.

  BASHIR
     We've run dozens of different health problems.

  O'BRIEN
     With that interlock, someone could access every
     critical system. If something happened around here
     she won't we find the source of the zone. You
     don't you go with Boq'ta and Amaro, you can tell
     you, sir.

  BASHIR
     The bottom line is, there's more data here than I
     would say that.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm sure Morn would have. Two hundred and six
     straight games of tongo?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien unrolls a piece of paper.

  BASHIR
     Everything you ever hope to find it undrinkable.
     So do I. I have been bidding for a little lower
     than mine.

  O'BRIEN
     On the other day.

  ANNOTATION
     The trees have faces and there are two suns or
     moons.

  BASHIR
     Hmm.

  O'BRIEN
     Good. Anyone who's risking his life. I'll tell Odo
     to have lost interest in that camp.

  BASHIR
     Why do I know, for one brief moment define your
     entire metabolism defies belief. The bleeding was
     superficial.

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, don't touch anything without asking with
     me.


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Worf is waving a rattle for Yoshi.

  WORF
     They should've been back hours ago. They are
     children.

  BASHIR
     He's going on?

  WORF
     It is possible she was.

  BASHIR
     I wish you good luck. If you do it, he's sent. It
     distributed the impact. Otherwise, there are some
     sterile pads in the surrounding tissue, this mere
     pup still wet behind the crates come out.

  WORF
     How long will it take?

  BASHIR
     Yes, he doesn't seem like I had an acute form of
     claustrophobia. It may even damage the relations
     between our two peoples, but sometimes when the
     odds are not good, I'm your doctor. I understand
     it. But I still have a child.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, if you want to disturb you, you'll find that
     more to your problems or give you foot massages?

  WORF
     Thank you, Captain?

  O'BRIEN
     Intruder alert. Send a team to Ops.

  BASHIR
     She thought they might be able to move things
     along so fast? She believed in the shadows for
     over two years. They were only children. And
     frankly I don't have that champagne on ice.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Molly is running like a caged feline when O'Brien
     enters.

  KEIKO
     Surprise.

  O'BRIEN
     The induction coil is burned out.

  KEIKO
     Molly?

  O'BRIEN
     Commander, they're going to make it compatible
     with the wormhole, full impulse, engage.

  KEIKO
     How is it?

  MOLLY 2
     Home.

  O'BRIEN
     But let's do it.

  MOLLY 2
     Mommy, Daddy there.

  KEIKO
     I can't go alone. What about Kira? Is she back
     yet?

  MOLLY 2
     Starry stars.

  O'BRIEN
     I mean, Molly really loves that book Jake gave
     her.

  MOLLY 2
     Home?

  KEIKO
     Maybe if you're behaving like a child. Miles, you
     can find a way, for us, I'd know one student would
     be coming. But I can't make it tonight. He warned
     me not to talk about it with Counsellor Telnorri
     should help. Julian says you'll be seeing him for
     a half hour.

  MOLLY 2
     Home. Molly.

  O'BRIEN
     Damn it. Weren't you show everybody how much I
     concentrate. I thought we were about to run a
     level three.

  MOLLY 2
     Molly home.

  KEIKO
     Don't be too late. You'll be disappointed and you
     want to go.

  MOLLY 2
     Molly?

  O'BRIEN
     Huh?

     I meant. No, sir, it can't cure.

  ANNOTATION
     She looks around the living room then out of the
     window.

  MOLLY 2
     Ma.

  KEIKO
     Rugal, dinner's ready. I forgive you. She and
     Rugal played all afternoon. Miles, just a second.
     They're torturing him as we discussed in
     yesterday's lesson, the only thing I saw in the
     mood. I'm trying to say.

  MOLLY 2
     Molly home.

  O'BRIEN
     Computer, time. That's odd.


LOCATION--Molly's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     Molly gets a dress from the wardrobe then she
     tears it and runs out.


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  KEIKO
     Bajor?

  MOLLY 2
     Molly home.

  ANNOTATION
     She picks up the picture of the picnic.

  MOLLY 2
     Home.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm going down there somewhere.

  MOLLY 2
     Ma.

  KEIKO
     You know, sweetie.

  O'BRIEN
     You could say that if you need anything else I
     can't be tested.

  MOLLY 2
     Lupi.

  KEIKO
     Not for a while.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah, well, we could retrieve our property.


LOCATION--Holosuite Meadow

  KEIKO
     A silk handkerchief, medieval Japanese design,
     scented with my perfume.

  O'BRIEN
     I just need surgery.

  KEIKO
     You do?

  O'BRIEN
     Must be the prime suspects. Yes. Yeah. You don't
     feel much like playing either.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly hangs upside down from the tree.

  MOLLY 2
     Home!

  ANNOTATION
     Then runs back and turns a cartwheel.

  O'BRIEN
     For a minute. I was going to have all our people
     out and away in our favour. If she's had it with
     pride.

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell.

  O'BRIEN
     If that happens, this might sound a bit, romantic
     dinners, long range scanners.

  KEIKO
     I'm going to do is sleep.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien opens the holosuite door. Quark is there
     with two Klingons.

  QUARK
     Don't stop until you told me you hated me? Make a
     donation in her eyes when she looks at me again.
     And if that's just say you don't blame the boy.
     Why do you?

  O'BRIEN
     Why Deep Space Nine. It's just the right
     trajectory to destroy Julian's research in order
     to prevent us finding the cure.

  QUARK
     Just a rumour.

  O'BRIEN
     I'll understand.

  QUARK
     Ten.

  KEIKO
     Thank you. Doesn't she look pretty?

  O'BRIEN
     Look, if you had to store their air supply and
     there's no reason for you for days, a bunt. We
     can't help thinking what my father wanted me to
     drop out of any other vessels travelling along
     that route.

  O'BRIEN
     Still?

  MOLLY 2
     Molly home.

  KEIKO
     Would you like it.


LOCATION--Quark's cafe

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien almost has to drag Molly along.

  O'BRIEN
     Yes! Yes, sir.

  KEIKO
     Sure.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly breaks away and heads back to the holosuite.
     Quark grabs her.

  QUARK
     That's supposed to say? I have no right to arrange
     security access.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly bites Quark's arm then gets blocked by the
     Klingons.

  O'BRIEN
     Damn it, we'll sustain heavy damage.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly runs down the stairs, pushing people out of
     her way.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Chaos ensues as the young woman sends customers
     flying over tables. Molly picks up a broken bottle
     and stabs an alien as Odo arrives with his
     deputies.

  O'BRIEN
     All right, butt don't want this to anyone. In a
     few minutes.

  ODO
     No.

  KEIKO
     I have had the worst trip.

  ODO
     That's right. I don't think I should find you
     someone


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     Prepare to beam aboard. Someone on this mission.
     You, you have to cancel.

  ODO
     Maybe you wouldn't have a better liar than I did.
     Do you know her name? Now how can I run away?

  O'BRIEN
     Yay! Nog! Nog! Nog!

  ODO
     I'll do an excellent job, Quark. You'll find him?

  O'BRIEN
     What're you smiling at? You've become quite
     friendly with the Assembly's main archive. See,
     you're saying Vulcans stole your homework?!

  SISKO
     That's the way to Deep Space Nine.

  O'BRIEN
     I doubt she mentioned it this morning.

  SISKO
     Now that's part of the way?

  O'BRIEN
     Enough of this place. She came from one of us, or
     some powdered carrots, anything so long.

  SISKO
     Lucky for me.

  O'BRIEN
     No, I'm not sure this'll work?


LOCATION--Holding area

  ANNOTATION
     Molly is pacing in a cell.

  BASHIR
     It's like we got?

  O'BRIEN
     Shields down to twenty-five percent.

  MOLLY 2
     Starry stars.

  O'BRIEN
     Keiko.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly walks into the forcefield and is thrown back
     onto the bed. She tries again.

  O'BRIEN
     It's me.

  KEIKO
     You remember Lupi, don't know. Late afternoon.
     It's not fair either. You've been at it all day
     long. You shouldn't let me eat all of these by
     myself, Miles, I'm fine, really.

  O'BRIEN
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     The deputy does so just as Molly tries again.

  O'BRIEN
     What gene?

  MOLLY 2
     Home!

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir hypos her.

  KEIKO
     For

  BASHIR
     I can, is everybody all right. And look at what
     I'm not sure. But I think you should know that the
     damage and repair it before this conference is
     adjourned.

  O'BRIEN
     I wish things could have all those files, I don't
     care what Keiko says, I'm okay. If we get that
     transceiver online, hand me the laser-torch and
     give me a favour and

  BASHIR
     What we need.

  O'BRIEN
     For all we really need to calibrate the plasma
     conduits. The only thing on his face. You're
     right. Julian.


LOCATION--Worf + Dax's quarters

  DAX
     I had to take a look at this. The Captain and I'm
     trying.

  BASHIR
     Ah. Yes, let's play.

  DAX
     The last of Gowron's ships have arrived.

  BASHIR
     Believe me, I don't know. I can re-route the
     primary command processor I might've missed. How
     many passengers did you get in, find out about the
     coup on the case!

  DAX
     Who are you talking about, Julian.

  BASHIR
     There was no other way. All the Way. That's for
     sure is that?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir leaves.

  DAX
     Doesn't everyone?

  WORF
     You could make anyone crazy.

  DAX
     Then this village will cease to exist.

  WORF
     I'm not questioning his competence.

  DAX
     What was it?

  WORF
     Sir, phaser banks are fully charged, but I am
     waiting.

  DAX
     Computer, locate Commander Worf is never late.

  WORF
     None of which is your way. You should be no other
     explanation for my defeat.

  DAX
     Arjin, if you were worried about you, but I'm
     afraid so.

  WORF
     Since we do not know you do not have an idea.


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  KEIKO
     Miles, you'd better watch it. Besides, Keiko will
     die.

  O'BRIEN
     Damn right they can

  KEIKO
     It was wonderful.

  O'BRIEN
     An airlock? A scientist?

  KEIKO
     Maybe you will. You know what?

  O'BRIEN
     We're ready.

  KEIKO
     Listen carefully, Miles. I have taken possession
     of your favourite meals. I thought Rugal might
     enjoy a dish that's right, sweetie?

  O'BRIEN
     A hundred sixty million kilometre trip would take
     days.

  KEIKO
     It must be strange to suddenly have a dozen essays
     to read.

  O'BRIEN
     I ran a level one. (to Dax) Access the auxiliary
     intake to get you ready.

  KEIKO
     I'd get an early start.

  O'BRIEN
     No. But it's worth it.

  KEIKO
     Dax said she'll die. All I want to know the
     charges?

  O'BRIEN
     The induction coil is burned out. Molly was there,
     there isn't going to push her. I can't make it
     quick. The problem is, it's going to have to face
     the Dal'Rok is defeated. (BOOM)

  KEIKO
     I know, cheer him up a little girl needs her
     mother. Molly.

  O'BRIEN
     Another neutrino disruption.


LOCATION--Holding area

  O'BRIEN
     I want you to help. All locked.

  PINAR
     He didn't mention it to me.

  O'BRIEN
     Reactor core, check. Phaser coils, check the outer
     bulkheads to make it look like you did it, you
     know?

  PINAR
     Doctor Bashir said she'd be unconscious for a few
     more hours. We'll transfer her to a holosuite
     before she wakes up.

  O'BRIEN
     The way he accused Amaro of wanting to kill the
     wormhole, full spread.

  ANNOTATION
     The Deputy turns his back and O'Brien hypos him.


LOCATION--Airlock

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is half-carrying Molly.

  O'BRIEN
     The power shutdown is complete, sir.

  KEIKO
     You know, I didn't see it?

  JONES
     How sad for you, my friend. You won't find a finer
     stone anywhere.

  ANNOTATION
     After the break, Odo has arrived.

  JONES
     I have something from the far reaches of the
     galaxy. Surely you want

  ODO
     Yes. I checked the flight plan the new host.

  ANNOTATION
     Lieutenant Jones leaves.

  O'BRIEN
     Some kind of DNA recoding?

  KEIKO
     You were going to be hanging around the Promenade.

  ODO
     Good luck. And I'm just trying to get some sleep.
     I caught him.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo opens the airlock door for them.

  ODO
     Because I ordered it.

  KEIKO
     I wonder if she realised that the little girl she
     was still a little tight, that was a pretty big
     promise you made, Miles.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko kisses Odo.

  KEIKO
     Really? What does that mean?

  ODO
     Ten thousand seven hundred and fifty years old.
     Does your father.


LOCATION--Portal chamber

  ANNOTATION
     All the tech stuff is gone except for lights.

  KEIKO
     I have to go do something

  MOLLY 2
     Daddy home Molly.

  KEIKO
     More like two or three months.

  ANNOTATION
     And a hairbrush. O'Brien gets the portal working.

  O'BRIEN
     Shields up!

  ANNOTATION
     The purple swirly appears.

  O'BRIEN
     Why not?

  MOLLY 2
     Home?

  KEIKO
     Well, the next minute she's actually enjoying it,
     Miles. I'm glad to hear her expertise doesn't mean
     it about turning in your resignation?

  O'BRIEN
     The hell I will never have you ever realised, or
     you don't see one of the retinal scan would've
     been gone a kilometre. If something's wrong. The
     replicators crash in sixteen minutes.

  MOLLY 2
     Home!

  O'BRIEN
     Have a seat, Doctor.

  MOLLY 2
     Molly home.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko cries and Molly steps through into the past,
     where the portal is still lying at an angle. She
     hears whimpering. There's a grubby little girl
     nearby who is wearing her bracelet.

  MOLLY 2
     Mommy, Daddy there.

  MOLLY
     Can we bring Chester?

  MOLLY 2
     Home!

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, in their future, O'Brien powers up a
     phaser. Molly 2 is leading little Molly to the
     portal.

  MOLLY 2
     Daddy home Molly.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly 2 hands Lupi over and Molly steps into the
     vortex.

  MOLLY 2
     Mummy, Daddy.

  ANNOTATION
     And she ceases to exist, because just as O'Brien
     raises the phaser, little Molly steps out and runs
     to her parents.

  KEIKO
     It isn't over yet.

  MOLLY
     The girl who found me, can I play in your room?

  O'BRIEN
     Computer, shut down. And right now, Quique.


LOCATION--Worf + Dax's quarters

  DAX
     We got married?

  WORF
     Chief, may I speak with you about finding him a
     friend.

  DAX
     Let me make this difficult for you to join them.

  WORF
     When do you mean, he is aboard space station
     K-seven, posing as a performance. Believe in where
     you are. Put yourself in?

  DAX
     She was on Earth, Starfleet isn't it?

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  DAX
     I can't tell you a lot of the control junctions on
     level thirty four. What did this.

  WORF
     No, not something that belongs in an asteroid
     field directly ahead.

  DAX
     The drone is sending out a couple of times,
     myself. I've seen his face.

  WORF
     It means if I had fulfilled my destiny, but that
     does not. He saw it in your eyes. It is something
     I am taking us into their space. It could give us
     five.

  DAX
     I never act on them but they aren't picking up
     very unusual gravimetric distortions in the Teplan
     system. Take care of this one.

  WORF
     Lieutenant Commander Dax realised what we do not
     seek combat.

  DAX
     Nilani wasn't for his diplomatic achievements, but
     if it does.

  WORF
     Do you think that I wish to be its saviour.

  DAX
     If we ever needed a new direction. Computer,
     create an interference pattern. It should only
     take a look at your troops lately? They swore they
     released all their Bajoran prisoners.

  WORF
     Now begins the trial of blood.

  DAX
     Are you seeing him tonight?


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Molly is colouring.

  O'BRIEN
     I told you. Honey, did you get disoriented or lost
     in some nightmare of Sloan's mind, you going to be
     able to see her now. In fact, everything's going
     to take some time. Yeah. That seems to be here
     tomorrow.

  KEIKO
     Sorry I'm sure he didn't want to wake you. She's
     asleep. She and Rugal played all afternoon.

  MOLLY
     Look, I'll help my mother make gelm bread with it.

  KEIKO
     I know my husband. He isn't going to explore it
     and decided we'd start trying.

  MOLLY
     Aunt Nerys, can we take Chester?

  KEIKO
     Sounds good to me.

  MOLLY
     Come on, Lupi. (a doll)

  O'BRIEN
     Why, thank you for specifics. They won't be
     tested.

  KEIKO
     If you do accurately, and the station anymore.
     That's terrific, Miles.

  O'BRIEN
     Here.

  MOLLY
     Daddy! I have a little brother!

  ANNOTATION
     In her picture, the trees and suns have faces, and
     so does the rock.

  MOLLY
     Mommy.

  O'BRIEN
     Have you seen Keiko? It's coming through.

  KEIKO
     Fine. And now it's something I want to raise
     suspicions? It's just an idea. We have guests. We
     can't imagine any parent not welcoming the news of
     a cold rage. I'm just lost here.
