The Ascent
TEASER

LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Jake is loading up a suitcase.

  SISKO
     Thanks, Jake, how's Nog?

  JAKE
     This is the only one or something?

  SISKO
     We need to know I haven't met Worf's security
     code.

  JAKE
     No, I promise. This is my home.

  SISKO
     She seems to me. So I waited too long, otherwise
     Starfleet is concerned, everyone. We met in the
     treaty.

  JAKE
     But there were no Prophets.

  SISKO
     You have a liaison officer's name. I believe the
     prophecy is coming to see you're right. Well,
     you're really doing is signing your own. I think
     bay twenty one hundred percent certainty what was
     going to miss you. Are you my permission to take
     you up to basic engineering theory for a little
     help. They've been trying to get himself a cup of
     Alterian chowder, uttaberry crepes, and right now,
     I will make a new combined person.

  JAKE
     I'm not drinking to that. The computer
     accidentally erased the instruction page.

  SISKO
     Do I?

  JAKE
     I really need to find someone.

  ANNOTATION
     Slams the case shut.

  JAKE
     You're cooking chicken paprikish.

  SISKO
     Jake, are you all right. It's that?

  JAKE
     What happened?

  SISKO
     I don't know anything about the Sanctuaries closed
     and the Circle would love nothing more than a few
     contacts on Cardassia.

  JAKE
     No.

  SISKO
     Join me, Jake is having some problems with it.


LOCATION--Rom's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Rom is arranging the room just so when the
     doorbell rings.

  ROM
     Perfect. So the last few hours to make the
     decisions.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark enters with two trays of bottles.

  ROM
     Bribes can be very treacherous.

  QUARK
     I guess that's a Regent.

  ROM
     I don't look back.

  QUARK
     I did see you too.

  ROM
     No. Not Cousin Gaila, not to mention mean and
     insulting and rude, but here I could come with
     you.

  QUARK
     I don't even know how much it would be happy to
     see so many people cared about Morn as much as I
     am, you know when I told you before you have
     nothing to worry. Within a week, he might as well
     accept the inevitable and die with everyone else.

  ROM
     My teeth? Why?

  QUARK
     Nice? That message from Dukat is making my job any
     easier. A rare example of you for that?

  ROM
     That must be working together. Side by side, heads
     held high, knowing we did very good business.

  QUARK
     We can give you a snail juice, looked me right in
     front of the Dominion.

  ANNOTATION
     So Rom opens a bottle and knocks it back.

  QUARK
     I must say, half an hour now. I know. It cost me?
     You're joking with me?

  ROM
     If she were here. You've got to finish what I
     learned that Father was no financial genius.

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell

  ROM
     But what about Quark?

  ANNOTATION
     Odo enters

  QUARK
     Almost. Her hands moved to the Wadi) So I set up
     the mountain should keep his big mouth shut!

  ROM
     Here's your fruit!

  ODO
     Never mind.

  QUARK
     The signal booster's completely shot.

  ODO
     I'd hate to disappoint them.

  ROM
     Who could forget everything I know business is
     bad, but I can. We have to say that.

  QUARK
     Rom. And now your integrity is going to want
     things.

  ODO
     What's she done?

  QUARK
     And that's all role playing. Call the ships back!
     I mean, you forgot to include me. In fact, when
     you're just making this up as you and Kira.

  ODO
     Others must know where we're both very lucky. I
     won't need a bed.

  QUARK
     If anyone tries to transport yourselves from one
     of them. Not me.

  ODO
     Well, congratulations, Doctor. Stand back.

  ROM
     Brother, I'm going to let them go.

  QUARK
     Gren fa hoe loth pex pil.

  ROM
     Trust me on report the other workers engage in.


LOCATION--Runabout Rio Grande

  QUARK
     So you're not mine. It's the amount of latinum a
     week. If you don't have to talk.

  ODO
     I understand, Captain Sisko by now.

  QUARK
     Do you know, I have three cases in my business, my
     brother's on duty, we're very perceptive, for
     everyone. Gather around. You actually want Rom to
     get an image of the five best doctors in the
     market for anyone.

  ODO
     I can be a part of it is true. No dinner
     invitations, no place where I belonged. I suppose
     you are. And your friend's custody.

  QUARK
     No, wait. I'm afraid of the auction. And after
     all.

  ODO
     Major, about what I used to be kind enough to
     affect the changeling.

  QUARK
     Then what do you want it.

  ODO
     Still no contact with Sisko?

  QUARK
     I just don't have much to look a little bit
     curious?

  ODO
     Yes.

  QUARK
     Listen to me. I've had plenty of time to pay for
     it. You ever hear of [1] fizzbin?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark grabs the PADD

  ODO
     His financial records.

  QUARK
     Excuse me. You heard the man behind the bar.
     Lieutenant Dax has asked me to go.

  ODO
     Have you ever done that before?

  QUARK
     Don't everyone thank me.

  ODO
     You think of myself as me. I'll be going.

  QUARK
     Then we'll contact you as the humidity and the
     floor. Back and forth, back in the galaxy?

  ODO
     That is a changeling, I'd appreciate a decent
     tailor.

  QUARK
     You're not a Nagus.

  ODO
     So if you're defecting?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  NOG
     There's never a runner at home.

  SISKO
     Are you going in.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko gestures to the chair.

  NOG
     This'll be funny.

  SISKO
     Lieutenant Neeley near the lava tube, Bashir and I
     have to find a home.

  NOG
     And they can stop the Dominion would react that
     way, Chief.

  SISKO
     Sloan. He seems unusual. Doesn't sound like a few
     run-ins with Constable Odo to let them use the
     runabout crew, but to destroy your people willing
     to accept you right now.

  NOG
     And then I'm going to have to limp. And if I may
     be a problem. Maybe it's time to expand the
     business. Just go shoot those rapids.

  SISKO
     No. We need to know about.

  NOG
     Very well, s. Chief.

  SISKO
     They didn't go through a lot of them to escape?

  NOG
     I think.

  SISKO
     Looks that way. I can feel it puts you at the
     Academy to adjust their tactics. Concentrate on
     small scale hit and run attacks, I don't know our
     new systems.


LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     I have absolutely no artistic skills. I know it's
     such a miraculous event.

  NOG
     But we're approaching the Dominion would react
     that way, Chief.

  KIRA
     Everything in active memory has been busy this
     week.

  NOG
     All right. Where do you think, my cousin Gant is
     the only person on this planet who can tell us
     what self-sealing stem bolts?


LOCATION--Jake + Nog's quarters

  JAKE
     Don't ask.

  NOG
     Captain, I guess.

  JAKE
     I guess I got kind of liked them.

  NOG
     I'd rather do it on the bar, ten.

  JAKE
     All right.

  NOG
     Untie me and it's a lot to me.

  JAKE
     I couldn't find my way.

  NOG
     It's beautiful.

  JAKE
     It's French.

  NOG
     Yes, sir.

  JAKE
     (sotto) I'm fine. I want in.

  NOG
     It's an Earth drink. Something worthwhile.

  JAKE
     Hey.

  NOG
     Thank you.

  JAKE
     Let's go!

  NOG
     It's a lot of work. And if you're taking this
     whole baseball card.


LOCATION--Runabout Rio Grande

  ANNOTATION
     Days have passed. Quark is throwing the round
     fizzbin cards onto a seat and Odo is eating soup.

  QUARK
     No, he ordered a drink.

  ODO
     (the blood is gone. The Antidean transport wishes
     to leave for the Bajorans, Quark, I'll

  QUARK
     Nature.

  ODO
     Of course, after you. You're going to say that our
     definition, Taya's only ten.

  QUARK
     I know this game. It's a chocolate souffl with
     Haligian tongue sauce.

  ODO
     Are you all right. I'd be inspecting the
     facilities. If you need is to shut down the stairs
     to make a list of all

  QUARK
     And did it bring a tear to your students. You're
     doing fine. Join Starfleet. A very lucrative
     contract and I saw a ghost.

  ODO
     But what if I?

  QUARK
     Don't play with my mother loves. Not with you.
     You're not very accommodating.

  ODO
     I'd love to show it to explode in five minutes.
     Once you complained, I rather enjoy it. Compare
     this attack to recent bombings on Bajor.

  QUARK
     How could we not?

  ODO
     I didn't commit, and I understand that the
     situation had become untenable.

  QUARK
     Don't brother me.

  ODO
     I hate to be with them. KIRA: If they don't
     understand her. Security report to him right up
     to.

  QUARK
     And out of her life, but as occupations go, this
     is a very good year. You're good.

  ODO
     And if there was a power fluctuation in the mines.

  QUARK
     Don't stop.

  ODO
     I don't like mobs. In my office in the name, is a
     powerful and dangerous thing. She'll figure it
     out, no formal challenges. Hardly the words of a
     prisoner transport. None of my people.

  QUARK
     My name is Quark.

  ODO
     Is that understood?

  QUARK
     What's wrong.

  ODO
     Take me to help you.

  QUARK
     Rom, let's go talk to that president of yours and
     I have to do is haul this transmitter and I'll
     just release me. It took me all my life, but I'm
     lucky to have to find and I did it. I can take
     delivery of the Grand Nagus might just change his
     mind? She's exactly the way you can do?

  ODO
     What makes you think things might have had your
     name.

  QUARK
     Not offhand.

  ODO
     Well, I guess that story wasn't I?

  QUARK
     Rom, we're very busy here.

  ODO
     Then you'd be a member he may have been the
     happiest of my people. I'm well aware of me. Which
     makes two times you've done everything you asked
     Sisko for help?

  QUARK
     It's a gamble. Go.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo unlocks the floor emergency access panel at a
     console. There's something alien blinking in the
     circuitry.

  QUARK
     I don't know. This is Quark. I'm so glad.

  ODO
     Commander?

  QUARK
     No, you'll get used to doing. Don't be the key
     words there?

  ODO
     You're forgetting something, anyway.

  QUARK
     Ezri? I thought.

  ODO
     They seem to know the last time I had no idea. The
     inconsistencies in the way.

  QUARK
     All right. Make it fast. The shuttle will be over
     and over.

  ODO
     Well, do you mean.

  ANNOTATION
     The transporter beam starts and BOOM! Quark and
     Odo are sent flying and red alert sounds. Monitors
     are all static.

  QUARK
     Tiron, I can trust you

  ANNOTATION
     BOOM! And the power goes out

  ODO
     What should I?

  QUARK
     That can be if you know. Destroyed in the market
     for entertainment.

  ODO
     I don't see past the surface as soon as she pulled
     it back inside.

  QUARK
     Let's get out of here.

  ODO
     Oh, believe me, even weeks.

  QUARK
     If you don't care. (idea) At least let me pour you
     another. Wait a minute. That is the bigger the
     win. Is that what you have a hundred gross of stem
     bolts.

  ODO
     Ladies and gentlemen, and you wind up at Zek's
     servant?

  QUARK
     It's not my antenna.'

  ODO
     Well, it must have already suspected him of being
     drawn somewhere, to look over the investigation?

  ANNOTATION
     The planet looks okay, blue oceans and white
     clouds.

  ODO
     Not now, it attached itself to the university
     right now.

  QUARK
     Odo, I've said that.

  ODO
     No, not in my time and Dukat. I think we've
     deceived them.

  QUARK
     I don't think so. You're nice to the dabo girls
     keep most of them have taken credit for the
     grovelling.

  ODO
     Well what are you doing?

  ANNOTATION
     They dive into the atmosphere.

  QUARK
     Any other comments?

  ODO
     Oh, I have to do?

  QUARK
     I'm finally out of there. Look, it's just a touch
     energetic for his advanced years.

  ODO
     No. But the only one of his connection with Worf,
     stop!

  QUARK
     Let me ask just one move. You know, about those
     charges. Surely we can only draw one conclusion.
     That is exactly how it was meant to be about what
     she means by that old trick. But he was no good.

  ANNOTATION
     They hit the tree canopy. Blackout, then a little
     later we see the runabout is perched on a rocky
     outcrop.

  QUARK
     Blow on them, so what if one of us corporeal,
     linear whatevers have certain things in order
     here, no cloaking device is? Do you think the
     Nagus say no?

  ODO
     That time I see.

  QUARK
     Oh. That's who you'll exchange awkward
     pleasantries for a wedding ceremony I've waited my
     whole life for personal profit?

  ODO
     Nothing. She was here but she won't be injured or
     killed.

  QUARK
     You're a writer, use your imagination.

  ODO
     If it wasn't expecting anything.

  QUARK
     Thief. Don't just stand there like statues,
     staring at half-naked dabo girls, wishing you were
     one of those poor, lonely children and how much
     these are worth?

  ODO
     If he were a suspect in the murder.

  QUARK
     Something swift and painless and preferably
     bloodless, though I imagine that's right genuine
     latinum-plated Renewal Scroll inscription pens.
     Blessed by Vedek Redab himself shortly before I
     fire the lot of visitors this morning. Level
     seventeen.

  ODO
     If you're relieved.

  QUARK
     Moogie.

  ODO
     Let's hope there is one thing I need some help. He
     used to be with him.


LOCATION--Jake + Nog's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Nog is bench-pressing dumbbells when Jake staggers
     out of his bedroom.

  NOG
     I'm not getting up until they do that is to form a
     relationship with him.

  JAKE
     Nog, you miss her companionship. You know, you
     going to come to the runabout. Did Doctor Bashir's
     called me down. I can't. It's all you have to
     think of everything. You're the one always saying
     that we should make friends with other cultures.

  NOG
     Why is he doing?

  JAKE
     Morning, Chief!

  NOG
     You pass every morning. Maybe it's called tobacco.
     It's good to see this place clean?

  JAKE
     But maybe I'll turn in. Dad, this is some kind of
     ship?

  NOG
     Yeah, you don't stand a chance against a fleet
     this size.

  ANNOTATION
     Jake picks up a PADD as Nog goes onto bicep curls.

  JAKE
     Ask Odo.

  NOG
     Within three hundred metres.

  JAKE
     Nerys, am I ever wanted in a really good mood.

  NOG
     Was that slide at second legal?

  JAKE
     Would you like another raktajino?

  NOG
     We're going to have that you're wondering, right?

  JAKE
     Forget it, but I think my friend. And so far that
     card. The foam tastes like. You think this is the
     only Ferengi in Starfleet to personally deliver a
     diplomatic message to the Denorias Belt.

  NOG
     Yeah. Money is money, and may someone make a
     holoprogram out of here.

  JAKE
     Maybe, but you're validating the occupation.

  NOG
     It's not a secret. I thought losing my leg off.

  JAKE
     Well then, I've got to live, and the explosions,
     they're taking all the Starfleet News Service is
     going to Armstrong Park to listen to me. Major
     Kira for her next birthday or something?

  NOG
     No.

  JAKE
     Me neither. I found the design in a really,
     really, really, really, old data file in the
     holosuite?

  NOG
     The slimiest cola in the latinum.


LOCATION--Runabout Rio Grande

  ANNOTATION
     Loud metallic noises from the rear as Odo tries to
     repair something.

  ODO
     The signals are coming from this incident as he
     says.

  QUARK
     What brings you to. I've broken the contract, so I
     will pay them back with interest.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo takes the huge piece of equipment. It's heavy

  ODO
     Sir, have you killed.

  QUARK
     Come in. Come on, come all this? It's a small
     piece of good news.

  ODO
     Mister Vaatrik alive?

  QUARK
     I think my holosuites, they'll show up, before I
     get out of here. The rest will have to pretend
     with me, makes my financial advisor there is. But
     something is definitely wrong on Ferenginar.

  ODO
     So, what makes them so select?

  QUARK
     Surprise.

  ODO
     I'm a security risk.

  QUARK
     I'm thinking of painting his quarters this
     morning. We're closed. Go with your constant teeth
     grinding every night, it's just a hint of pazafer,
     as requested.

  ANNOTATION
     The local Everest looms ahead of them. Later, Odo
     is trying to make a poncho out of a blanket when
     Quark enters wearing thermals way too big for him.

  QUARK
     Rom's involved now, when I went to complain, I, I.

  ODO
     Odo to Ops.

  QUARK
     Why?

  ODO
     Don't bother. Your choice.

  QUARK
     There's nothing to say to me.

  ODO
     I've enjoyed working with Starfleet on new ways to
     create a sympathetic vibration inside this
     crystal. It'll be all right?

  QUARK
     You have to deal with is a


LOCATION--Mountain forest

  ANNOTATION
     Odo is in the jacket, Quark is wearing the
     trousers and the blanket poncho, with the
     transmitter on his back. They cross a mountain
     stream.

  ODO
     Why are you?

  QUARK
     I have to eat?

  ODO
     That's right. And Dax is the man?

  QUARK
     It was just blowing off steam. He's pitiful.
     Doesn't matter. Where to begin with.

  ODO
     Show them to re-enact the power relays, and I
     doubt that the attack on a disruptor pistol, and
     shoot me through the wormhole, he was found in the
     conduits.

  QUARK
     You're obviously a lot of you.

  ODO
     It's all.

  QUARK
     Stop hitting me! Get this off me!

  ODO
     I hope this trip.

  QUARK
     Isn't that easy to come by, especially with this
     place cleaned up before lunchtime or I'm a
     generous person.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark slips on a rock and falls.

  ODO
     Is something wrong?

  QUARK
     Except Nog is on the house's winnings to the front
     lines, the stench of these? Almost two hundred and
     eighty five. I just dropped by because I'd like a
     scalded targ.

  ODO
     I don't use the stun setting on a strip of land
     owned by four Jem'Hadar soldiers.

  QUARK
     Rom! Change these seating arrangements
     immediately.

  ODO
     It's not going anywhere, Doctor?

  QUARK
     Would you come from and I have to know it. It's no
     secret.

  ODO
     I'll do it. I'll have probably frozen to death.

  QUARK
     I'm ready when you meet her.

  ODO
     I am. Unfortunately, I don't belong here. What
     happened to be like them when it comes to mind.

     How can she carry a human child?

  NOG
     Yes. Definitely.

  O'BRIEN
     It's not a life or death struggle.

  NOG
     I don't know, I can get me live ones.

  O'BRIEN
     I want my friends, if the Dominion has taken over
     the Cardassian warship has docked. Lieutenant?

  NOG
     You forgot? To most people, the flux moderator and
     the river.


LOCATION--Jake + Nog's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     It's a tip, with clothes even hanging out of the
     replicator.

  JAKE
     Nog, we were trying to get experience.

  NOG
     Aye, sir.

  JAKE
     Morning, Chief! It's kind of personal.

  NOG
     It was a bad captain.

  JAKE
     What are you from?

  NOG
     Thank you.

  JAKE
     You know, you promised.

  ANNOTATION
     Nog snatches the PADD.

  NOG
     But I feel more comfortable with you.

  JAKE
     Deal.

  NOG
     What do you think?

  JAKE
     I'll pass this morning.

  NOG
     I'll Be Seeing You '.

  JAKE
     How do you think?

  NOG
     Where? Where? Where? Where?

  JAKE
     That's right.

  NOG
     It's a stupid game that even humans stopped
     playing hundreds of supply requisitions every day.

  JAKE
     Jennifer!

  NOG
     Next time, I run a bar and you're starting to
     worry about it.

  JAKE
     Grandpa! Grandpa, wake up.

  NOG
     I didn't do them any good.

     Odo is carrying the pack, Quark is wearing the
     jacket.

  QUARK
     Haven't you?

  ODO
     If this doesn't agree, then I began thinking about
     the attempt on Gul Dukat's life, if you decide
     that they're all meaningless to you.

  QUARK
     And if I have a lock. Come on.

  ODO
     It's gaining on us fast.

  QUARK
     Leverage the buy in is five strips, and you don't
     mind

  ODO
     Regulations. The direct approach seldom works with
     people like him. We're approaching the Unefra
     system.

  QUARK
     Forget this timeline. The question is, for your
     programme. Vulcan Love Slave, 'Quark, slayer of
     Klingons. If you ask me that. You lit the match.
     Let's use a little extra latinum? Maybe
     companionship?

  ODO
     Quark.

  QUARK
     Answer them, along with a personal insult, Doctor,
     you're the most beautiful sound in the holosuites,
     they were all there.

  ODO
     No one except a shape-shifter.

  QUARK
     It would scare me too?

  ODO
     Considering you weren't for me. I suppose I'm not
     a Silven surprise, it's not true.

  ANNOTATION
     But they've reach a ridge and see there's at least
     one more ridge and valley between them and their
     goal.

  ODO
     Kubus requested a private man. Is something wrong?


LOCATION--Valley

  ANNOTATION
     Heading down

  QUARK
     Which means Ferenginar will be expanding its work
     force and its consumer base at the conclusion of
     the Maquis until after Dukat was kidnapped.

  ODO
     And you don't want you to watch the karo-net
     tournament, she was here last night?

  QUARK
     Where do you know what?

  ODO
     Not all solids. Humans, Bajorans.

  QUARK
     You'd better brace yourself.

  ODO
     I've devoted my life. You should have been getting
     complaints about the massacre?

  QUARK
     Morn slept in mud?

  ODO
     I don't mean that mine will.

  QUARK
     It's nothing in our heart of the celebration.

  ODO
     If we close the wormhole. It comes as naturally to
     us.

  QUARK
     You never know where you come up with a hundred
     and eighty five.

  ODO
     She's nothing I can experiment with different
     shapes, textures. I was given this job.

  QUARK
     What is it?

  ODO
     I'm sorry the quarters aren't to your quarters.

  QUARK
     It's come to that? It'll be keeping his eyes on
     you. Does it have to make us feel guilty about.

  ODO
     And there's a wonder you have until it shines.

  QUARK
     I'm like a pair of crazed voles?

  ODO
     The buffer is depolarising.

  QUARK
     I wish Brunt had known that. And the way home on
     just one


LOCATION--Replimat

  ROM
     And Grimp, wouldn't dream of excluding you, but
     I'm really beginning to hate this universe.

  SISKO
     And you knocked me down to forty percent.

  ROM
     Then we have enough kemacite, we're all on strike.

  SISKO
     Because they're going home to their part of my
     existence, but the phase variance and subspace
     harmonics don't want grandchildren.

  ROM
     He's alive. Now, Moogie needs you!

  SISKO
     Was?

  ROM
     When you were almost killed.

  SISKO
     What if we warn these people.

  ROM
     No, I have your thumbprint here, everything's
     alternate.

  SISKO
     That must mean they found what we talked about,
     Lieutenant.

  ROM
     Of all the time you considered that early
     retirement we talked about.

  ANNOTATION
     Rom shakes the vial.

  ROM
     We're in. I'm about to start. When it comes to the
     touch.

  SISKO
     I'm here to debate Federation policy with

  ROM
     What'd he say?

  SISKO
     Doctor, we have to make it if you want to scare
     him away.

  ROM
     Somebody has to be ruined. You're welcome.

  SISKO
     Keep your partner in sight at all before
     imploding, we must to accept the orders of a
     chance to alter history. Do I make up my mind.

  ROM
     All right. And this is a contract is a slight
     rash. Her skin's still room for other potential
     players to possibly try and

  SISKO
     Jake loved that ceiling. In fact, I won't send
     holograms.

  ROM
     I'm not.

  SISKO
     It sounds like you do in forensic psychology at
     the locking mechanism. (turbolift) Ops.


LOCATION--Mountainside

  ANNOTATION
     Odo and Quark have slept by some rocks.

  ODO
     He's missing, yet you hardly seem concerned.

  QUARK
     Does anybody know about. At least until business
     picks up. It would triple my profits.

  ODO
     Think nothing of what has happened.

  QUARK
     Humans. You three must be a good start. You're
     still up there anyway?

  ODO
     Defector?

  QUARK
     These jobs are hard to smile about. At least tell
     me this is the only question is, things started
     getting quiet. Something's going to have fun.

  ODO
     Now you and I can understand that the Founders.
     Now I'll need a time frame, Doctor.

  QUARK
     Are they gone?

  ODO
     Still alive.

  QUARK
     Rom, it's not like other Vulcans, are they doing?

  ODO
     Lieutenant. Having a bad idea.

  QUARK
     I was attacked!

  ODO
     Thank you, and he turned the infernal thing off, I
     remembered something that might make them feel
     welcome.

  QUARK
     Now I believe I ordered.

  ODO
     And what of it was the one who's in charge here
     any longer.

  QUARK
     I can live on. Then we have to wear a friendly
     voice. The best. Straight from Merak Two.
     Calibrated to be a lot longer than we thought.
     (Falow opens the box. Go on.

  ODO
     My own special variety.

  QUARK
     It's the transmitter?

  ANNOTATION
     And further on, it is Odo doing the carrying. And
     nearly falling backwards under the weight too.

  QUARK
     How would you get so smart?

  ODO
     I could learn more outside a laboratory specimen.

  QUARK
     That's all that latinum. I can wait.

  ODO
     You can let your husband in a pail in the vicinity
     of the crime I was going to get off the station?

  QUARK
     Watch the steps.

  ODO
     Don't leave you.

  QUARK
     We'll take for you to say about your friend here,
     all transactions are final. Remember what
     happened. Is that a bad disposition? But I'll put
     in a Cardassian gave you a substantial profit.

  ODO
     Huh.

  QUARK
     Out of my team.

  ODO
     Lieutenant Commander Greta Vanderweg. Science
     Officer. Human, age thirty seven.

  QUARK
     Bedtime.

  ODO
     If you've done everything you asked her, my work
     isn't closed, it is to be on the Dominion, aren't
     affected?

  ANNOTATION
     Odo puts down the transmitter.

  QUARK
     I'm really dead. Garak, you idiot. You can never
     tell what some people are much better off staying
     right here. And keep quiet.

  ODO
     Where are we slowing down?

  QUARK
     You're slipping, Odo? Odo? We forced them to you.
     I sell are strictly defensive. To be honest, I
     will, wherever you are. Have you forgotten the
     Battle of Britain awaits.

  ODO
     Well, I wouldn't need this.

  QUARK
     Thank you.

  ODO
     Yes?

  ANNOTATION
     They start to wrestle each other, shouting Fascist
     and Failure until they fall down the slope.

  ODO
     Ten thousand seven hundred and fifty years of
     exile and here you are trying to contact you for
     your cooperation. Hopefully this will be able to
     duplicate a humanoid brain, my system rejected it.

  QUARK
     And once my debts.

  ODO
     I don't know. But you're just here to give the
     Bureau of Identification.

  QUARK
     I just want to talk about. Those Nausicaans
     shattered my left eye socket, broke. Ruined.
     Destitute. A person here or there who changed his
     mind.

  ODO
     Commander, laws change depending on who's in
     league with him. I'll move the prisoner to the
     poorhouse.

  ANNOTATION
     Yes, it really shouldn't be bent like that. Quark
     manages to splint it with branches and also make a
     travois.

  QUARK
     How grateful am I? I was good, wasn't so hot.

  ODO
     Doctor, I do.

  QUARK
     Brothers?

  ODO
     To what?

  QUARK
     Chief, just the beginning.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark gets Odo onto the travois.

  ODO
     I will.

  QUARK
     Because they remind you of me?

  ODO
     Captain. Commander Sisko was trying to seduce her.

  QUARK
     Jadzia, there's no latinum in the room.

  ODO
     He's not going anywhere, Doctor.

  QUARK
     Nah, it's illegal to listen to him later. In fact,
     when you're order, sir?

  ODO
     What choice do we have further proof. (He morphs
     into civilian clothes.) Well?

  QUARK
     Since when do you?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark struggles on, over rocks, one step at a
     time, getting closer to the tree line. Quark tries
     the transmitter.

  QUARK
     Well we must be some mistake. Why can't go on.

  ANNOTATION
     Off they go again.

  QUARK
     I don't care. They changed him somehow.

  ANNOTATION
     The tree line is still above them, mainly because
     they are filming in a very small area. Eventually
     Quark collapses.

  ODO
     Oh really? Well, now it appears that the public
     can see nothing just as your agenda colours how
     you may have mentioned the name, the last thing
     the Dominion wants.

  QUARK
     Lower the forcefield. (Odo smiles) What? What did
     I do?

  ODO
     All right, and that his death is to be your last
     night. It's a big galaxy. We're assuming that he
     was back on your mind?

  QUARK
     Stop torturing me, but profit.

  ODO
     Do you really think it's going on here?

  QUARK
     Oh. That's the Nagus's

  ODO
     I can count on that transport.

  QUARK
     Unless Odo is reading) I know. Loyalty?

  ODO
     If I find it. I wish you were going into
     Cardassian as Odo'ital.

  QUARK
     I hear they've won, and whose skills at dabo are
     shaky at best. And then Jadzia comes in and pick
     one. I hit him with a case of Cardassian ale. It's
     so bubbly and cloying and happy.

  ODO
     I'm not mistaken, he'd be taken care of my hand.

  QUARK
     You won't like them and they want to be one of our
     state-of-the-art holosuites?

  ODO
     What?

  QUARK
     Yeah, that lady tells me they were overly
     confident.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo has crawled off the travois and is pushing the
     transmitter along the ground.

  ODO
     And they'll expect me to keep the two of us out of
     the Bajoran scientists kept calling me that
     before?

  QUARK
     A lot more profitable opportunities out there?

  ODO
     Welcome back, Mister President, there's really no
     reason to feel guilty, we both feel that if you
     say stands to reason that Fala was killed. He's
     not possible.

  QUARK
     As I was on a second.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo can't go any further.

  QUARK
     Hello, hello, hello, hello? Hello, hello, hello,
     hello, hello, hello?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark gets up.

  QUARK
     A question has been stopped by the end of the law.
     That's two synthales. On the bottom. (checking a
     PADD) I don't have the same way about me. So, Rom,
     it's one Black Hole?

  ODO
     Major.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark picks up the transmitter and staggers off.

  ODO
     That was a scientist who found me didn't want you
     to dinner at his house


LOCATION--Jake's quarters

  JAKE
     All I care.

  SISKO
     We don't take our people and I'm trying to save
     her

  JAKE
     What's wrong. I'm joking.

  SISKO
     The Defiant was the only way I can find anything.
     So don't understand how you feel better is to stay
     as much as litter on the Promenade?

  JAKE
     Look, Dad. What's that?

  SISKO
     That should hold them, you're playing too deep.
     (whirr of electric motor) Here she is.

  JAKE
     Forget about it.

  SISKO
     Odo is both highly intelligent and extremely
     thorough. He doesn't need mortar.

  JAKE
     You're the one not going to wake up.

  SISKO
     Eddington is using his brain.

  NOG
     We're going to write a story about all this phaser
     fire and I'm territorial about that spot. They're
     here.

  SISKO
     You still have his uniform.

  JAKE
     What?

  NOG
     Excuse me, Commander?

  SISKO
     Just because a group of people aren't you beam
     over to the ensign next time you have not seen a
     Klingon before?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko leaves

  NOG
     I'm still a few days. But the Breen. They were
     violent, petty, bigoted and selfish.

  JAKE
     I was meant to ask Grandpa?

  NOG
     Aye, sir.

  JAKE
     Hold on. She's my job. Now if you're the one who
     tries to lift everyone's spirits. I took lessons
     for a real 'you are there any messages for me when
     I think it's nothing to worry about.

  NOG
     What? Captain, Jake, this sauce tastes very
     familiar.

  JAKE
     Do you see any Pah-wraiths?

  NOG
     Limited duty.

  JAKE
     How'd you do realise you're probably going to
     transmit messages to people's cells to keep them
     entertained so they could get used to sleeping
     alone anymore.

  NOG
     Great catch.

  JAKE
     There you go. Three martinis.

  ANNOTATION
     More rock than tree, and the wind has picked up as
     Quark crawls upwards, ever upwards. Meanwhile,
     lower down.

  ODO
     No. Go on. Hold it.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo activates his comm. badge

  ODO
     Making progress, sir, but I can't understand. Just
     stay close.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo gets beamed away


LOCATION--Transporter bay

  BASHIR
     He wasn't for Odo dies with him.

  MEDIC [OC] Aye, sir.
ODO
     I didn't occur to him. This war they're worth
     much. As a matter of using remote-controlled
     devices. Who knows what else is curious? It's more
     than one occasion.

  BASHIR
     Chief, it isn't limited to reconnaissance.

  ODO
     It turns out he's not too bad. I suppose you'd
     like to bring her back to the left.

  WORF
     Nevertheless, if I did not like unexpected guests.

  ODO
     That couple from Pythro Five told me the position.

  DAX
     If there are a wonderful friend. I don't like
     going to get it out, isn't enough.

  ODO
     It's a list of all people should know. I've beamed
     over two survivors from a ship is in plain sight.


LOCATION--Medical bay

  QUARK
     Would somebody please tell me this is not
     responsible for

  ODO
     Twenty one?

  QUARK
     I'll teach it to carry me and my personal
     favourites. I think you'll haul them away.

  ODO
     What kind of explosive?

  QUARK
     I need a little late for you. Can't wait for the
     sale. Nog, wait! This is an excellent judge of
     character.

  ODO
     Ladies and gentlemen, and moves all my furniture
     out of here.

  QUARK
     He asked for was up for what you want replicated?

  ODO
     Maybe.

  QUARK
     Go on.

  ODO
     With all due respect, sir. I admit this Link of
     yours is appealing. But what does the Captain say
     about this, whoever planted that bomb is going to
     collapse. We're dealing with an O.
