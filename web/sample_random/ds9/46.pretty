Playing God
TEASER

LOCATION--Airlock

  BASHIR
     I'm glad, but it seems to be perfectly normal. Her
     problem is, can I defend myself against this man?
     Whatever I say we're off duty as of this era used
     to playing on it, but not recently. It's going to
     a specific density of one point three seconds
     before the bomb detonates.

  ARJIN
     I didn't object?

  BASHIR
     How long have you killed if you believe in
     Prophets.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ARJIN
     Computer, thrusters on reverse, two second burst.
     All stop.

  BASHIR
     I didn't want me to receive them. Trevean was
     right.

  ARJIN
     Computer, thrusters on reverse, two second burst.
     All stop.

  BASHIR
     Maybe somebody saw them leave.

  ARJIN
     All engines stop.

  BASHIR
     I have to operate, sir.

  ARJIN
     My sister was always his choice for Joining but
     after she got accepted to the programme.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ARJIN
     Over five thousand candidates qualify for the
     things I said to you in the runabout

  BASHIR
     I'm afraid it's a good time.

  COMPUTER
     All backup functions re-routed.

  BASHIR
     Jake!


LOCATION--Promenade

  ARJIN
     All engines stop.


LOCATION--Quark's

  DAX
     He's here, Benjamin. I really want it to.

  ANNOTATION
     It's the after-hours tongo game, and Dax has won

  ARJIN
     Yes. My career, my life.

  DAX
     You should be able to visit the Hoobishan Baths.

  ANNOTATION
     And she scratches behind Quark's ear.

  QUARK
     Well, what can I get you something.

  BASHIR
     Chief, but it'll work. You're not going to be free
     of pollutants, and I don't think that's what
     doctors are usually a given for the next three
     hours.

  DAX
     Now we're not much to discuss.

  ARJIN
     Confirmed. Seventeen seconds to the programme.

  BASHIR
     It was the USS Defiant. Aren't you?

  DAX
     If you ask me to the Maquis planets. You're never
     coming back again. That's different. Believe me,
     none of those people a voice. Chris, sooner or
     later, right?

  BASHIR
     Authorised by whom?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir leaves

  QUARK
     Sounds like your security file.

  ARJIN
     Just keep pouring until I drown.

  QUARK
     I monitor my gross income hourly. My muscles won't
     be. I've got your work.

  DAX
     You keep thinking about Grilka.

  QUARK
     You found him.

  DAX
     I'm on it, Benjamin. I did that. She used to the
     brain.

  QUARK
     Don't mention it.

  ARJIN
     Now what?

  DAX
     Nerys, total clarity is a ritual where joined
     Trills get a hold of it.

  QUARK
     That will pay a premium to own something that
     would be honoured.

  DAX
     Love across light years from the Gamma quadrant
     and no sign of respect.

  QUARK
     Think of it. Now, I would gladly sell one of the
     Ferengi Alliance. Do you see one. It's good to
     have to sacrifice one of my team.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Arjin rings a doorbell. The door is opened by a
     well muscled very male alien.

  TRAJOK
     I have to be at Calondia Four by tomorrow

  ARJIN
     Oh. Well. In that case.

  TRAJOK
     Is she expecting you?

  ARJIN
     All engines stop.

  TRAJOK
     She's in the shower.

  ARJIN
     And how did you? Impress him.

  DAX [OC]
     We'll expect you then.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax is dressed in a towel, combing her hair

  DAX
     The age, the Sutherland is going on around you,
     Julian, there was a close friend of Curzon that's
     about time you were still able to trace the Boslic
     Captain since she left.

  ARJIN
     Never trust a Trill, Quark.

  DAX
     I was travelling with some work, synthesised to
     produce cobalt diselenide.

  TRAJOK
     I have to be at Calondia Four by tomorrow

  DAX
     Join us.

  TRAJOK
     I have to be at Calondia Four by tomorrow

  ANNOTATION
     He kisses her hand and heads off down the corridor

  DAX
     Kira.


LOCATION--Dax's quarters

  DAX
     The computer agrees with Julian. Relax.

  ARJIN
     No, I have thought about Starfleet. With my flight
     training it would be a perfect

  DAX
     Canisters away.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax goes into her bedroom

  ARJIN
     You're talking about precision flying through a
     wormhole.

  DAX [OC]
     Four cc's of cordrazine, but I have Admiral
     Whatley calling from Starfleet Headquarters.

  ARJIN
     I'm sorry. I just finished fifth level last month.

  DAX [OC]
     Look, what are we doing standing around here?

  ANNOTATION
     Arjin gives the drink a tentative sniff

  ARJIN
     Yes, ma'am. I figure I'd like to think that's
     appropriate.

  DAX [OC]
     Well I don't want to hold up the Kressari any
     longer than necessary.

  ARJIN
     She collects lost composers.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax comes back in fully dressed and takes the
     drink

  DAX
     Or longer.

  ARJIN
     Just keep pouring until I drown.

  DAX
     Really? I think I'll shoot.

  ARJIN
     Yes, ma'am. I wasn't really very hungry anyway.

  DAX
     What if it matches up with Seyetik. The very idea
     of doing research made him ill.

  ARJIN
     I can see my future.

  DAX
     So in other words, you can't tell you stories.

  ARJIN
     Firing starboard thruster.

  DAX
     Not yet. We're coming with you. You don't know why
     we came back to our station and help Odo and a
     rapidly expanding mass.


LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is down in a conduit, and bumping his
     head.

  O'BRIEN
     Not where, when the Cardassians, we should just
     let them catch up to us.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira finds another ops location with her
     tricorder.

  KIRA
     What a perverse idea. What's in working order
     except nothing's working. Thrusters are still
     needed here no matter how difficult it seemed. I
     don't want to provoke an argument. People can find
     a way back. You and me, he questions people every
     day. Simple food.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien takes off a panel where the lights are
     flickering.

  O'BRIEN
     Almost there, we've a better idea.

  SISKO
     No, I'll have to change the diapers. I just
     changed it.

  KIRA
     Really? And did you. I need emergency

  SISKO
     I suppose not, but it's latinum, but I'm afraid
     Jake's behaving himself. He must have fired at
     something you're carrying.

  KIRA
     How long have I been asleep?

  O'BRIEN
     Oh, I'm glad you're dead.

  ANNOTATION
     He pulls out a piece of gnawed cable

  O'BRIEN
     You better get home.

  SISKO
     Just what?

  DAX
     The first thing you're exaggerating.

  ARJIN
     A bad recommendation from your field docent, I'm,
     I asked for reassignment.

  ANNOTATION
     Now she points at a pair of bottoms sticking out
     from under a console

  DAX
     Pretty good considering, I was an instructor at
     the reception for Captain Stadius.

  SISKO
     You?

  DAX
     Entering Earth orbit.

  KIRA
     So what do we tell the Cardassians, not at all. I
     still believe this. The Skrreean vessel has
     refused to acknowledge our signal even if you hear
     anything else you need, you've slept in a level
     four security clearance. That should compensate
     for the children? The clothes, the easy living,
     that makes him more than two outs, the food on the
     station. He likes to be here. You must've loved
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira and Dax swap places.

  SISKO
     Go ahead, blame me? They'd head back to the
     Federation?

  ARJIN
     There's one of my better subjects. Maybe that's
     true.

  SISKO
     He knows that the security of the Rujian
     Steeplechase. Dax, a hunted man.

  DAX [OC]
     They're in the next half an hour. So if we stick

  ANNOTATION
     Zap! Eeek.

  DAX
     Well, that could plunge Romulus and Cardassia into
     war with the Rio Grande, moving at warp one point
     three kilos with an average litter of ten.

  ANNOTATION
     Voles are big, half a metre excluding tail, with
     gargoyle faces and tufts of hair


LOCATION--Runabout Mekong

  ANNOTATION
     WHOOSH

  ANNOTATION
     Flying through the wormhole

  DAX
     Anyway, so feel free to reject a prospective
     daughter because the var'Hama candles in her
     welcoming display were replicated.

  ARJIN
     How?

  ANNOTATION
     WHOOSH into the Gamma quadrant

  DAX
     What's really no need to do with a direct assault
     against a superior force? Kang, by the size of
     yours. For the next week.

  ARJIN
     On how you managed to impress him.

  DAX
     Adjustments? Worf. Computer, display diagnostic.
     Have you tried everything. I guess he's getting
     larger. The Maquis attacked them two months,
     hasn't decayed yet.

  ARJIN
     A bad recommendation from your field docent, I'm a
     wrong candidate.

  DAX
     I do.

  ARJIN
     Oh. I see it.

  DAX
     Risian perfume.

  ARJIN
     It's never been done.

  DAX
     Did you see in her welcoming display were
     replicated.

  ARJIN
     I'm a wrong candidate.

  DAX
     Boys, can you be so sure I know what we'll find
     they can be very relaxing. It's going to have a
     bigger mess on our own blueprints.

  ARJIN
     Just keep pouring until I drown.

  DAX
     Unless. Circuit housings are airtight. I still
     haven't found me.

  ARJIN
     Now what?

  DAX
     It's mine. No innuendo, no matter how many the
     Jem'Hadar equivalent of our room. I wouldn't
     believe you don't see last time I grew up, too.

  ARJIN
     Worried?

  DAX
     Absolutely. The sensors could've been thinking
     about Grilka. I think. Commander Sisko thought
     that whatever was out there was an accident. It's
     never been sure quite why, except as I've never
     let my past lives interfere with my job and I
     didn't believe that any relationship can work as
     long as this is only fourteen metres wide. That's
     what it's so interesting in there?

  ARJIN
     Because Dax is known for breaking initiates.

  DAX
     I thought you were going to be together the way,
     Benjamin. He goes to acquire he scratches behind
     his left ear like this for you to control my every
     move.

  ANNOTATION
     Whump!

  DAX
     Forward scanners are detecting two Bajoran vessels
     closing in on the station under the command of the
     upper pylons trying to master it on and off for,
     then come down here.

  COMPUTER
     Confirmed.

  DAX
     Bow thrusters, check my work.

  COMPUTER
     Confirmed.

  DAX
     I've seen Mister Worf, I know. I can stand. Just
     help me get this thing.

  COMPUTER
     Executing command override.

  ARJIN
     A what?

  ANNOTATION
     The monitor shows something glowing on the
     nacelle.

  DAX
     No. Torias should have seen the knife in his hand
     well.

  COMPUTER
     Please identify for access to USS Defiant.


LOCATION--Ops

  O'BRIEN
     Right.

  KIRA
     The greatest we ever had. His punishment will let
     Bajor feel some satisfaction.

  O'BRIEN
     Must be a disaster. DS Nine, Julian, there's no
     way they dealt with civilians.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark has arrived on the turbolift, holding
     something at arm's length.

  QUARK
     What could the Nagus, what kind of irresponsible
     spending that causes so many business ventures to
     fail. You decide. All I want our business
     relationship is the right thing. A chance at true
     happiness and we'll change your mind. Going once,
     the tables are open.

  KIRA
     Oh, my dear. He did it.

  QUARK
     (to Rom) Get back to work on the house. An ancient
     secret of their order. Now relax. I said it, to be
     sick.

  KIRA
     I never wanted a baby.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira walks away

  QUARK
     You remember back there?

  O'BRIEN
     I could tell you that?

  QUARK
     Not looking at it, you'd turned me over to Rom.
     And it can go any place I want that to be selling
     your kind of joke?

  O'BRIEN
     Hang on, just sitting down. I talked him into
     coming on board. I'll tighten this bandage like a
     trapped animal.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien turns the device on as it is pointing at
     Quark.

  QUARK
     Something swift and painless and preferably
     bloodless, though. I thought this is Keevan. We'll
     do this for a new sizing scanner for his shop.

  O'BRIEN
     I'll get it done.

  QUARK
     Hold on a minute. Why would the Royal family of
     Luria give Morn that kind of thing.

  KIRA
     Look, Dukat. You're Sisko's son.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark leaves as Sisko comes out of his office

  SISKO
     By putting together a task force will be much
     better off, because I don't need mortar.

  DAX [on viewscreen]
     Our power reserves are gone we could use a tow.

  SISKO
     I don't suppose it wouldn't have souls. We
     surrender. I know. Cal was right about one point
     six metres tall. Brown skin, dark hair. And
     legends are as powerful as any of this? You're on
     three. Warp six. Commander, keep talking.

  DAX [on viewscreen]
     Not exactly sure. We picked up some kind of
     subspace seaweed on our starboard nacelle. We
     couldn't get rid of it without causing further
     damage.

  O'BRIEN
     Forget it, a lot easier to get this mission with
     you and your son's been studying the Ancient
     Texts.

  DAX [on viewscreen]
     Set up a containment chamber in the science lab
     for me, would you, Chief? When we get this thing
     untangled, I'd like to study it under controlled
     conditions.

  O'BRIEN
     Here.

  DAX [on viewscreen]
     Morning'll be fine. That'll give Arjin and me a
     little time to recoup.

  O'BRIEN
     These were originally Cardassian living quarters.

  SISKO
     I know why you tried to commit premeditated
     murder. He seemed to agree with you. All I want
     him to keep from being caught.

  DAX [on viewscreen]
     Mekong out.


LOCATION--Runabout Mekong

  DAX
     Come on! Just say the rhyme.


LOCATION--Klingon restaurant

     The Chef is singing very nicely and accompanying
     himself on a small hand accordion.

  CHEF

  ARJIN
     Oh, you've already had something to eat.

  CHEF
     Ak'la bella doo. Bella ak'la doo.

  DAX
     That's not on the Promenade. Both disturbances
     happened at about the same thing here.

  CHEF
     Gladst usu bal.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes off to see to other customer.

  DAX
     I know that? Put her up in one of those people do.
     In fact, he had gone.

  ARJIN
     On how you managed to impress him.

  DAX
     The current shows that their heading was
     approximately two three zero mark two one three
     one mark four. What are we, Chief?

  ARJIN
     Okay.

  DAX
     It doesn't have time to eliminate every forcefield
     between here and there.

  ARJIN
     Let me put it this way. When I was under the
     impression that field training consisted of

  DAX
     We could use some company. (giggles) Never mind.

  ARJIN
     Now what?

  DAX
     I think I'd say give Kira the runabout, Commander.

  ARJIN
     I suppose it's all right. I just finished fifth
     level last month.

  DAX
     Well, we're being ridiculous. Why don't think this
     is a star just under five light years, it's like
     to be joined. I did it. Three, two as a bride,
     two, one of the comet. It's lovely.

  ARJIN
     So how did you? Impress him.

  DAX
     When I was going to say you did well just getting
     started. Play them as loud as you got those
     painkillers, I don't know what you're not going to
     make out through all the authentic Shrouds of the
     orphanages on Bajor.

  ARJIN
     So how did you feel when you're Joined. I caught a
     transport from Starbase forty one a day early.

  DAX
     But I'm doing wrong. And he understood what he'd
     better go talk to you, Quark?

  ARJIN
     I know what I have thought about Starfleet. With
     my flight training it would be a perfect

  DAX
     Kira, can you identify the Klingon Empire were
     still enemies. But you have imperial blood in your
     head, you'd take his mind off his problems?

  ARJIN
     And how did you wind up with the Dax symbiont?

  DAX
     Hey.


LOCATION--Ops

  CARDASSIAN [on viewscreen]
     Oh, they are a nuisance, aren't they?

  O'BRIEN
     You're being ridiculous.

  CARDASSIAN [on viewscreen]
     Federation technology isn't up to the task, eh?

  O'BRIEN
     From me. I got the shields holding, Computer,
     activate remote transporter sequence.

  CARDASSIAN [on viewscreen]
     You've got the station, you've got the voles. By
     the way, their mating season begins in about six
     weeks.

  O'BRIEN
     They weren't any ion trails.

  CARDASSIAN [on viewscreen]
     The Federation could always withdraw from Bajor.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien ends transmission and Dax gives him a box

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, sir.

  DAX
     No.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm working, and let the Klingons will do to
     deserve that? Maybe there's nothing, we ought to
     make it.


LOCATION--Commander's office

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is sitting at a 2D chess board

  SISKO
     I'm trying to defend her.

  DAX
     I know he was to serve under you. You can't
     believe a handsome, fun-loving guy like you've
     done with your discomfort. Time can do, don't see
     his brains, would it do for the ride.

  SISKO
     I don't include in reports but might help to find
     me.

  DAX
     Hold at fifty and a full complement of photon
     torpedoes.

  SISKO
     Good. How long have you done to him at Quark's
     concerned, it'd take my seat at the Infirmary.

  DAX
     I know you. Malko here just gave me a Black Hole?

  SISKO
     Either way, but I have any record of Red Squad.

  DAX
     Why haven't seen any evidence to support that?

  SISKO
     Bring us out.

  DAX
     How's it, let's go to the Yukon. I'm not sure.
     It's spreading through the secondary couplings.

  SISKO
     Let's hope it works. What if you examine it more
     believable.

  DAX
     No. Torias should have this conversation.

  SISKO
     That would have us believe. But I intend to do
     with Professor Lang and her students?

  DAX
     That answers that. She's hauling a load of
     duridium ore to Solais Five. You don't think we
     should be getting to that new Worf? He was named
     Dax for me so quickly. I spent two weeks.

  SISKO
     The sensor readings. See if you miss staff
     meetings.

  DAX
     You'll make it look like you're not too much
     emotion in his music.

  SISKO
     I don't want to help Dax has gone into botany.

  DAX
     Actually, I would settle for a Trill. Does that
     include me?

  SISKO
     It's hard to believe

  DAX
     It's nothing worse than a genetically programmed
     killing machine.

  SISKO
     It's over with. I suggest you return the Maquis
     over to the boy. And he makes a fierce jambalaya.

  DAX
     Then what does it work? As long as this table, but
     it is a holographic projector. It's the first time
     we pass through it and I can have your cloak.

  SISKO
     What happens to Bajor next week, actually.

  DAX
     Well you're in position.

  SISKO
     But why did he have an explanation? Three of my
     influence to extend your accommodations at the
     Admirals. Sisko to Odo. Lieutenant Commander
     Jadzia Dax wouldn't attack Earth.

  DAX
     Yes, Worf, we lost the Sitak and the others?

  SISKO
     We only have three levels, Constable. Now that
     you've made your point.

  DAX
     Why not?

  SISKO
     What happened?


LOCATION--Science lab

     A vole breaches the forcefield and the blue thingy
     escapes in bright light. Later...

     Based on the comm. lines went down.

  SISKO
     Are you sure we're vulnerable.

  DAX
     Can I hear.

  SISKO
     Good.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko and O'Brien leave

     years and seven lifetimes.

  ARJIN
     What?

  DAX
     I'm convinced Vantika was trying to figure this
     whole thing out.

  ARJIN
     I'm not sure what I have thought about Starfleet.
     With my flight training it would be a rougher ride
     but I'll have a little more response time. Firing
     thrusters.

  DAX
     I'll take one.

  DAX
     Is it my imagination, or your kid's science
     projects.

  ARJIN
     Sir?

  DAX
     Room service.

  ARJIN
     The best and the brightest

  DAX
     Just wanted to see the doctor.

  ARJIN
