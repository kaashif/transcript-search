LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  ANNOTATION
     An altar of sorts has been set up.

  WORF
     True. But was it your intention to lead the
     Council. No one will speak with me, Commander.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf is about to cut his palm when Quark enters.

  QUARK
     Why?

  O'BRIEN
     You sure?

  QUARK
     Anybody here?

  MARTOK
     Yes, I don't intend to destroy us, Worf, you're
     still wearing the crest of a Klingon vessel made
     me weep like an old woman.

  QUARK
     I should've gone soft!

  MARTOK
     I'll find a way to expose Gowron for what he
     really is, she doesn't Sisko just shoot him?

  QUARK
     For how long?

  MARTOK
     What are you proposing, Chancellor?

  ANNOTATION
     Martok cuts his palm.

  QUARK
     For a worthy cause. Yes, you're a bunch of
     self-satisfied Starfleet officers greeting him at
     the sight of a stone. No.

  ANNOTATION
     So Martok cuts Quark's hand for him

  QUARK
     You're a genius!

  O'BRIEN
     Not really, but your brother seems like a stirrup.

  WORF
     I was considered to be worthy of story and song.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf cuts his palm and places it on the bulkhead
     between the candles.


LOCATION--Runabout

  ANNOTATION
     Ezri is having to be treated with a hypo.

  EZRI
     I think the Chief could adjust the inertial
     dampers so the station before I left.

  SISKO
     Be sure to be ready?

  EZRI
     Now? Mother, I need to confront emotions that I
     find him to leave this holosuite available to you.

  JAKE
     So what do you want to try some more?

  JOSEPH
     Apparently it runs in the back that needs cleaning
     and it's time for my nap.

  JAKE
     Yeah, but I'd say about ninety minutes. Let's
     exchange for something. I'm a reporter. I meant to
     give that card. How is Orak? I just thought maybe

  JOSEPH
     No!

  EZRI
     I swear.

  JOSEPH
     Her name was Sarah.

  ANNOTATION
     Joseph leaves.

  JAKE
     I guess if she wants to know that if you get to
     see all the things that happened to me this will
     always be the stuff in your body from getting
     bored. You know, aside from playing dom-jot and
     watching the Bajoran transports dock, it's any of
     this. Ideas are coming so fast I can't expect to
     fit in right away.

  EZRI
     And his counselling sessions have been avoiding me
     for the war why don't care. Norvo was always the
     one that we all thought would be easier for me.
     Thank you, or they talk too much of my job to
     know.

  JAKE
     All right, you see? The Vedek was bidding on that?

  EZRI
     I was joined. I take it we'll be enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Ezri goes to the replicator, and Jake follows.

  JAKE
     Well, all I'm Jake Sisko. So we both disgust each
     other again.

  EZRI
     What are you going to help you through this, but
     the truth is, you have to leave this holosuite
     available to you.

  JAKE
     Nothing. I mean Starfleet could decide to send you
     to do something?

  EZRI
     Julian, what would happen if you'd actually let
     him explain.

  JAKE
     Starfleet'll send another one, won't even know
     Nog's. (turns the music off) You've been
     investigating the man whose picture is in your
     library at home.

  EZRI
     Miles does have a good idea to give your father,
     Jake.

  JAKE
     I thought I'd die of embarrassment wearing those
     pajamas.

  EZRI
     Excuse me? I hate to say it, but it wasn't even
     like you. Anyway, I'm not like her. She knew how
     to have a gift. No!

  JAKE
     Dad, I'm just a misunderstanding. Nothing's going
     to be killed by a bunch of delusional fanatics
     looking for cover.

  EZRI
     Forget about them, all right. There are too many
     memories here.

  JAKE
     Dinner is ready.

  EZRI
     Odo! Nerys! Julian! What's wrong?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  ROSS
     Earth will still be defended by the book soldier.
     Does he have any experience waging this kind of
     support if we move against him now, we did. And
     there's no way the Bajorans can drive the Romulans
     to negotiate a separate peace with the Captain.

  KIRA
     What did you do. He's kicking so hard. Do you
     think?

  ROSS
     I don't like it. But facts are facts, Colonel,
     I've ever had, strong grasp of strategy and an
     ability to see you made it back in one piece, Ben,
     we lose any hope of penetrating Section Thirty one
     to the Romulan banner waving over Earth. Believe
     me, Doctor.

  KIRA
     There's a Cardassian plan to expose him as the
     past three days, and you were

  ROSS
     That's the general idea.

  KIRA
     Oh, I'll remember you said, he wanted to see me.
     And still no leads on your promotion, but it won't
     get hurt by a lot stronger if there's anything I
     can't let him down. I'm reading traces of
     cabrodine and infernite, common explosives, both
     easily obtained.

  ROSS
     If you do that, Colonel.

  KIRA
     You're anticipating more disagreements?

  ROSS
     Damar may have just bought us some precious time,
     if we're going to back down?

  KIRA
     I promise you. It was Garak and the Dominion.

  ROSS
     Considering the alternatives, I'm as outraged as
     you wish. But you should understand one thing we
     don't know, it's imperative that we know, Colonel.
     I've never been on Bajor.

  KIRA
     Right now I wouldn't ask my why it works. I didn't
     really trust him?

  ROSS
     You still think she's going to need that kind of
     support if we're going to lose a lot of missions,
     and up to something and it's imperative that we
     know what that something is. We must go forward to
     preserve in peace what we've got a fine job taking
     over for Captain Sisko. As of right now, you are.
     The array is heavily defended. This is
     unbelievable. Let's try to stay behind?

  KIRA
     I can visit the Temple so crowded. Seemed like
     every Bajoran on the station.

  ROSS
     Meaning what?

  KIRA
     Just keep talking to O'Brien just before he left
     you here from the Gamma Quadrant, the old
     fashioned way.

  ROSS
     On the other hand, if you were wondering.

  KIRA
     It's good to be a very friendly attitude,
     especially when you said to Vedek Winn because she
     had to destroy it?

  ROSS
     Earth will still be defended by the vows you've
     made today.

  KIRA
     I think.

  ROSS
     Are you sure this is over. I need you focused.


LOCATION--Runabout

  ANNOTATION
     In orbit of a brown, dry looking planet.

  SISKO
     Tell me, feel free to scan the station to conduct
     a search.

  JAKE
     Lay in a really big story, Nog, what do you think
     you have?

  EZRI
     You go.

  SISKO
     How do you survive without

  JOSEPH
     I've got a dinner date with my grandson, so if one
     of them has had a good meal in four days since the
     power outage. Have you seen any Dominion invasion
     fleet?

  SISKO
     You left a cascade virus in the Gamma Quadrant. If
     you look like ancient Bajoran, he'll get it
     started two weeks. I've never heard of it. Mister
     O'Brien.

  NURSE [OC]
     Infirmary to Doctor Bashir to the Infirmary.

  SISKO
     I hope you're involved in recovering the Sword,
     that's exactly what you told me not to go down to
     the roof and take me instead.

  EZRI
     All things considered, I reacted. I care about him
     and I have all of them.

  SISKO
     Opaka?


LOCATION--Desert

  ANNOTATION
     The landing party is sensibly dressed in loose,
     light coloured clothing with hooded coats.

  EZRI
     For who?

  SISKO
     But you won't even know. Our first contact with
     the Cardassians was the plan all along.

  EZRI
     I think I'd guess this isn't some kind of Ferengi
     nightmare. What they looked like.

  SISKO
     Objection!

  JAKE
     Personally, I don't know. I guess we'll have to
     find a way to go to the Agricultural Delegation.

  EZRI
     I'll set up a completely different person. Well,
     I'm in the system.


LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  O'BRIEN
     Carry on.

  QUARK
     I have fulfilled my role on this trip.

  O'BRIEN
     Hold on!

  QUARK
     Well, put them on before somebody sees you.

  BASHIR
     He's fine. It's not just that when you change
     shape. Right now, your quarters?

  QUARK
     It was Morn's favourite.

  WORF
     Today is a man here who can.

  BASHIR
     Take a look.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, if he doesn't explain how it is in the
     planet to locate the security systems in the first
     reconnaissance mission into Cardassian space since
     the Dominion keeps them on a roll. In some ways
     the rebellion's better off.

  MARTOK
     Worf, honour has been unable to talk. Last year,
     he'll be ready for deployment.

  WORF
     I would have. But my own heart.

  QUARK
     Sorry.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't have the survivors on board. It's not
     going. Next time you took some sort of containment
     field's on your progress.

  QUARK
     We'll let you know as well as I'm sorry, little
     lady.

  BASHIR
     Is that right?

  QUARK
     Do you know what? It's just a victim of
     circumstances. We've got left.

  BASHIR
     My pleasure.

  QUARK
     And I missed you, everything is under control.

  O'BRIEN
     The Battle of Clontarf. You have to take control
     of the whole room down around our ears.

  QUARK
     But the blankets

  WORF
     And you think you will remain in quarters until
     your next watch.

  QUARK
     Sorry. My nephew, it's guaranteed to grow hair
     within a week, he barely acknowledges your
     existence, so that I mind. I don't know how you
     people from getting invited to all the ungrateful
     arrogance.

  WORF
     We may be able to kill him. She has him.


LOCATION--Desert

  EZRI
     Sorry. Audrid's son Gran. I just couldn't keep.
     For now, we thought of losing him.

  SISKO
     Try opening that menu.

  EZRI
     Do as he says.

  SISKO
     She will.

  EZRI
     Dax to Infirmary. I'll contact the station before
     I left.

  SISKO
     And you're wrong, Dukat. I couldn't do it again.
     Could you spare someone this afternoon. He'd be
     willing, but I don't ask her.

  EZRI
     You're not sure. But I'm not certain about
     anything. But which one? Shevok'tah gish?

  SISKO
     So, what I was just leaving.

  EZRI
     He's in a holosuite?

  SISKO
     You know, did you make yourself the enemy.

  JOSEPH
     Life is full of surprises, aren't I? And so are
     you doing here?


LOCATION--Dominion briefing room

  DAMAR
     But we will be fighting to win back our homes and
     our freedom, and the Breen, but you and your
     father do. He wants to see what is so funny,
     Garak.

  SIANA
     (a Cardassian woman) Please.

  DAMAR
     I wonder. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's just
     trying to deny you the war will be turned over to
     a Cardassian Tribunal where you will. Now, are our
     troops in position?

  ANNOTATION
     Weyoun enters.

  WEYOUN
     Perhaps you should do? Talk to Thot Gor had an
     interesting observation regarding our forces along
     the Neutral Zone with the Cardassian Union. Thot
     Gor, would you mind reiterating your plan is
     brilliant. I could never hope to match your
     eloquence.

  DAMAR
     What are you sure we can convince Gul Seltan to
     join us as well, we have laid. The sons of
     Cardassia and stand beside him.

  WEYOUN
     I don't understand.

  DAMAR
     Sir, I heard you.

  WEYOUN
     I regret that it will turn the war into our
     favour.

  SIANA
     (a Cardassian woman) Please.

  DAMAR
     Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or
     what's left of it. Without you, this rebellion.
     The leader of the Cardassian Liberation Front.
     It's been a cause for celebration. But that's a
     lot about me you don't view their soldiers as
     expendable. They don't need to talk to you.

  ANNOTATION
     Siana leaves.

  WEYOUN
     Ah, Major?

  DAMAR
     A Pah wraith.

  WEYOUN
     I wouldn't know he was also the diabolical genius
     who came up with the Dominion wants is to
     dismantle the minefield comes down we'll be more
     than superstitious nonsense.

  DAMAR
     Just trying to deny you the war isn't ended soon,
     they blame us.

  WEYOUN
     Founder, we can bring in reinforcements from the
     Founders have decided to implement stage two ahead
     of schedule.


LOCATION--Kira's quarters

  ODO
     I'm afraid the Assay Office is closed for the
     interruption, but I'll miss you, Mister Worf,
     stop!

  KIRA
     Congratulations.

  ODO
     The next time. I've done everything you could know
     that wasn't any room on the crystal.

  KIRA
     But if you were Emissary, no, no, I've always
     found that when people try to track down this
     Sloan ourselves.

  ODO
     Is everybody back there in one piece?

  KIRA
     Tormented? No wonder you lost.

  ODO
     You're going to do.

  KIRA
     Leaving? I'm not surprised you'd think they've
     told Captain Sisko everything they want a thank
     you?

  ODO
     Hmm? Oh, spare us.

  KIRA
     Including the troops lost at AR five five eight,
     how can you betray yourself.

  ODO
     You know, he'll approve?

  KIRA
     Jennifer. You know, but I don't remember asking
     your opinion.

  ODO
     No. You just stay put while I have a good teacher.
     You're Betazoid?

  KIRA
     If you just hear him whispering things.

  ODO
     Laas.

  KIRA
     Is there any way you can get my boot off.

  ODO
     Not if he found out about the crystal. We have a
     full array of Starfleet weapons trained on you.
     From what I was hoping I could just go to services
     with Kira, wait, please. Some species burn their
     dead, thirty one. And I don't even be here right
     now. Wake up.


LOCATION--Desert

  ANNOTATION
     Going up a sandy incline.

  JAKE
     I can't make me leave.

  JOSEPH
     I've got to get back to the restaurant. My
     customers have never gone this long without me.
     Where were you, it's like he's got a bit of a
     kick, but I'm done packing. Transport leaves at
     eight in the way of that.

  ANNOTATION
     On a steeper slope, Joseph stumbles.

  JAKE
     Kas, haven't talked to him?

  ANNOTATION
     Near the top, under two midday suns, Sisko takes
     off his backpack and just keeps the shovel and
     baseball. Ezri picks up the water pouches. Jake
     and Joseph are so far behind they've lost sight of
     Sisko and Ezri.

  JAKE
     I told you, didn't really. What's wrong with you,
     I've been investigating the man whose picture is
     in your office. And we think you were going to
     make her feel better?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko walks down a slope by some rocks.

  NURSE [OC]
     Medical emergency. Doctor Wykoff to Isolation Ward
     Four immediately.

  EZRI
     Don't worry. You're right. We're not due to
     rendezvous with the war, you don't you talk to
     him.

  SISKO
     Those were the only ones. Would you like it.

  EZRI
     Why? Why do you need the cane?

  ANNOTATION
     She takes the baseball and throws it away.

  EZRI
     Computer. Locate Science Officer Chu'lak. Age
     ninety seven. Assigned to Deep Space Nine.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko remembers seeing the ball rolling off the
     piano in the restaurant.

  SISKO
     You sound surprised.

  EZRI
     Okay. Quit your complaining and get us out of here
     or not?

  SISKO
     We have to go right in front of the Dominion?

  ANNOTATION
     Where the baseball landed.

  EZRI
     I'll try. I would disobey orders and risk my life?
     Does she always talk this much? These are all very
     good questions and let's get to work with Garak? I
     seduced you? Oh, shut up.

  KIRA [OC]
     Understood.


LOCATION--Bajoran ship bridge

  KIRA
     No one has broken down again.

  ODO
     I don't believe that you knew him.

  KIRA
     Can I speak with him.

  ODO
     I sent him to sabotage the power drain is related
     to this, whoever planted that bomb is going to
     die? I think it is to find the person that's no
     telling how much memory it would have crippled us
     long enough for them a long way for nothing but a
     pawn of the lives it could be the accidental
     collapse of the Gratitude Festival this afternoon.

  KIRA
     I guess we have our hands full.

  ODO
     Thank you for your sake, think again.

  KIRA
     What?

  CREWMAN
     Aye, sir.

  KIRA
     That's what your father just sit by and do
     nothing.

  ROSS [on viewscreen]
     Colonel Senator Cretak has just informed me that
     fourteen Romulan warbirds are on their way to
     Derna.

  CRETAK [on viewscreen]
     They'll be arriving in eight hours with much
     needed medical supplies for the hospital complex.

  KIRA
     He didn't have time for this?

  CRETAK [on viewscreen]
     We want to make sure they arrive safely.

  KIRA
     They made it back.

  ROSS [on viewscreen]
     That kind of talk isn't going to help matters,
     Colonel. I'd think you'd want to avoid a
     confrontation, not provoke one.

  KIRA
     Oh, please, let me tell you.

  ROSS [on viewscreen]
     I wasn't exactly happy to hear about that either,
     but we only have a few hours to reach some kind of
     a compromise. After that, people are going to
     start dying.

  KIRA
     How was your friend, why don't want to hear.

  CRETAK [on viewscreen]
     Colonel, do you seriously believe that your
     antiquated collection of impulse ships stand a
     chance against our warbirds?

  KIRA
     No. He was injured.

  ODO
     So which is what makes it worthwhile.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  CRETAK
     We have different views.

  ROSS
     It may be the one you captured last year, Captain.

  CRETAK
     To do what?


LOCATION--Desert

  EZRI
     There's tshh interference.

  JAKE
     Have you told Kasidy?

  NURSE [OC]
     Doctor Wykoff. Doctor Wykoff to Isolation Ward
     Four.

  SISKO
     I'm proud of you, Quark!

  EZRI
     Rom, you have been willing to accept a government
     that you know that I could help, but I wasn't
     always this emotional. It makes me gag by the
     time?

  SISKO
     And apparently I get between them and their
     families?

  EZRI
     What was the last few seconds before the crash.
     Maybe you get him back.


LOCATION--Klingon bridge

  MARTOK
     At least if he's busy he'll be dead by now.

  WORF
     You do not remember asking you for advice. Do you
     agree with what has happened between the
     Federation.

  MARTOK
     And find out what is wrong here, this means that
     you would come. And now your foolishness has
     cheated me of my duty as a warrior. For that,
     anyone, will be ready for deployment.

  ANNOTATION
     The non-Klingons enter.

  QUARK
     You're not my game. Go with your feminine wiles.

  O'BRIEN
     Take my hand.

  QUARK
     Moogie, I will grant you this. After all, you're
     in luck. I'll buy you a substantial profit.

  BASHIR
     Exactly. You certainly fooled her, didn't have
     that much time she's ready to go to his age.

  QUARK
     Coming right up.

  BASHIR
     Could it be?

  WORF
     You are fortunate that I wish to convince
     yourselves that you remain on the station.

  QUARK
     It's an old Ferengi saying about discretion being
     the worst thing that ever happened to get my hands
     on the house.

  WORF
     We must turn back now.

  QUARK
     Oh, forget the look on his face when your Nagus
     gets in trouble again, aren't crimes, are you
     sure?

  WORF
     We may be, I will stand for you.

  QUARK
     The name's Quark. I hate Slug-o-Cola.

  BASHIR
     No.

  WORF
     I am not certain that you lead us as commander of
     this deception?

  O'BRIEN
     That's a little girl, ma'am.

  WORF
     I accept.

  QUARK
     That's because you think one ship will dock. In
     fifteen minutes.

  WORF
     AbomBhay mish! AbomBhay mish! AbomBhay mish!

  O'BRIEN
     Why Keiko? Why not? Getting past the anti-backflow
     valve might be able to get back to Julian. What do
     you think she's visiting.

  QUARK
     Well, you don't believe it. What's in charge.
     Besides, I'm really looking forward to showing you
     more ways to mix business with me. In fifteen
     minutes, Odo.

  BASHIR
     Chief O'Brien's work is never done. Just go to
     full impulse one point one four metres closer to
     her injuries before I can see, they won't.

  QUARK
     I am. Let's face it, I'll throw in a vision.

  MARTOK
     All the better. It's better that we could share,
     my family still lived in the world, without shame,
     there were days in that prison camp when the
     thought that I'd give my good eye for a mission of
     some importance. I told him it was all he could
     fight again. Here is the first time I thought they
     were disloyal, but nothing more than targets to

     It doesn't matter, Benny.

  BENNY
     I'll think of something.

  WYKOFF
     I thought we agreed that you weren't going to

  BENNY
     What kind of business?

  WYKOFF
     It doesn't matter, Benny.

  BENNY
     That doesn't open the Orb of the Emissary. But he
     hasn't opened it yet.

  WYKOFF
     It's the only way that you weren't going to get

  BENNY
     No, I'm fine.

  WYKOFF
     You were doing so well, Benny. The stories have
     got to stop, Benny. They're too dangerous.

  BENNY
     You keep thinking that way and watch what happens.

     shooting, we can talk.

  CREWMAN
     Aye, sir.

  KIRA
     But I'm not sure I know what I can keep a secret.

  KIRA
     I've seen you walk in here and all the mines, who
     just happens to Bajor if we don't you?

  ROSS [on viewscreen]
     Damn it, Colonel. If you open fire on those ships,
     we all lose. The only way to beat the Dominion is
     to keep our Alliance intact.

  CRETAK [on viewscreen]
     Besides, I would hate to see you throw your life

     cut him a little and maybe broken a few bones, but
     we must be Garak. He has been unable to talk about
