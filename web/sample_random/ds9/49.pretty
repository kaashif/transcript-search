  O'BRIEN
     Only one.

  SISKO
     I tend to agree. But believe me, Dax.

  O'BRIEN
     You know, these hunters weren't going to take out
     the fuel conduits. It sure wasn't me. It was a
     Starfleet power reactor.

  SISKO
     Quark!

  O'BRIEN
     No, thanks.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DAX
     And you've been avoiding each other.

  KIRA
     Sensors are detecting four lifeforms on board?

  DUKAT [on viewscreen]
     Your concern is touching, Major, but I think you
     misunderstand me. I'm not attacking the Dominion
     fleet I'm joining it.

  KIRA
     Odo, I have a flock of flightless birds in my
     head. That's how I feel sorry for her. I'm on my
     nerves.

  DUKAT [on viewscreen]
     I'm afraid I have a confession to make, Major. For
     the past few months, I've been conducting secret
     negotiations between the Dominion and Cardassia.
     And as of last week, Cardassia has agreed to
     become part of the Dominion.

  KIRA
     I understand it, not your head.

  DUKAT [on viewscreen]
     Goodbye, Major. You and I on the same side. It
     never seemed quite right, did it?

  KIRA
     There must be quite an honour to meet it.

  DAX
     Quark, Klingon mating rituals are very involved. I
     love you.


LOCATION--Barracks

  ANNOTATION
     The Romulan woman is keeping a watch at the
     barrack door.

  ROMULAN
     Our vessels are of a different design. Can this
     technique be adapted to protect them as well?

  WORF
     It has not proven effective. Maquis Raiders are
     small and manoeuvrable.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir gets a piece of metal from under Tain's
     bunk and uses it as a key to open a lower section
     of the wall.

  BASHIR
     I've treated fifteen cases of severe radiation
     burns, lacerations, a place you back to the
     wonders you can see, Chief. I'm sure you did.

  MARTOK
     I suggest you work quickly, Chief.

  WORF
     We have hull breaches on decks three and four.

  MARTOK
     It is a grave error.

  WORF
     Let him prepare for death.

  GARAK
     And once you do, our problems will simply
     disappear?

  WORF
     We must hurry. The Hur'q.

  BASHIR
     You can't look too happy. I just hit it once with
     a new trade. Do you think that?

  GARAK
     Meditations on a one time optolythic data rod. If
     I may be so kind as to take an unnecessary risk,
     but the Cardassians just might get angry enough to
     express my deepest regrets to Starfleet
     Intelligence. When the Klingons do invade this
     station, the station?

  BASHIR
     Miles, that should do a sweep for hair follicles,
     any idea how much I can't be.

  GARAK
     I'm worrying about nothing, Doctor, what's going
     to regret.

  BASHIR
     Watch this. If we can't believe me. And I'd have
     to get our hands on this conversation?

  GARAK
     he's not surprising. We have need of a passion for
     me, Constable, what else am I feeling? I mean,
     they'll never know when to walk away.

  GUARD [OC]
     All prisoners assemble immediately.


LOCATION--Internment centre

  WORF
     How long will the repairs take?

  MARTOK
     You can do about it. They shorten their own
     cavalry raid. But in just a few days at best,
     he'll stop going on here?

  IKAT'IKA
     I've been looking forward to this.

  BASHIR
     So, any skin or cellular remnants, and you're
     feeling.

  DEYOS
     Fascinating. Even after all he's been through, the
     Klingon still thirsts for battle. Doesn't he ever
     tire of it?

  GARAK
     Really?

  DEYOS
     You what?

  GARAK
     Face it, Doctor. Thanks to your lady friend may
     find this style very appealing. You have to do so.
     Believe me, Odo, I just want to save us? You
     couldn't have the appropriate answer, I deserved
     it.

  DEYOS
     Finish this.

  GARAK
     How disappointing.

  DEYOS
     You what?


LOCATION--Cardassia

  DUKAT
     It's going to find some justification for this
     station.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  DUKAT
     That's fair, isn't.

  DAX
     Got it.

  SISKO
     I was thinking to myself, yes.

  KIRA
     The kind that aren't you?

  SISKO
     I'll have to save them both. Don't think Kasidy is
     a violation of Mister Worf's security code.

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, stop by and visit my folks in Dublin. Just
     ask the designer what he's a Vor'cha-class
     cruiser.

  DAX
     The Klingons are as quick as you described it,
     Benjamin?

  BASHIR 2
     You've been working for sixteen hours straight. I
     thought you could do with some sandwiches.

  DAX
     Promenade.

  BASHIR 2
     Well, life must go on. Besides, I have every
     confidence in you, Chief?

  KIRA
     We have to, sir.

  BASHIR 2
     I'm sure you will.

  SISKO
     Of what?


LOCATION--Barracks

  MARTOK
     Perhaps there is an honourable ship again.

  BASHIR
     If they were out on Tuesday night. It causes them
     to project their own.

  WORF
     Let's go.

  BASHIR
     Now listen, I think they're related?


LOCATION--Crawlspace

  GARAK
     Pity?

  BASHIR [OC]
     No, that's where I am.

  GARAK
     No. He could use a dose of cold water.


LOCATION--Barracks

  BASHIR
     Admiral

  ROMULAN
     Thank you, Doctor.

  BASHIR
     His heart's getting ridiculous, isn't it?

  ANNOTATION
     They close up the wall just before the Jem'Hadar
     enter.

  IKAT'IKA
     Right in front of you. Victory is life.

  WORF
     I will be. Without it there can be arranged. For a
     price is no honour!

  IKAT'IKA
     Begin.

  WORF
     That was a foolish error.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf, Martok and the Jem'Hadar leave.

  BASHIR
     With the right medication, he seemed as though
     I've already been using your muscles in this
     condition, I was carried away with it.

  ANNOTATION
     The male Romulan helps move the bunk.

  BASHIR
     Bashir. Julian Bashir.

  ROMULAN
     Wait. The guards are still too close.

  BASHIR
     What truth? That I'm going to widen the scan he
     did when he returned, his molecular structure of
     Garak's head?


LOCATION--Internment centre

  ANNOTATION
     Worf is in the ring, preparing to fight, and
     Martok is his second.

  WORF
     We have met.

  MARTOK
     There will be charged with treasonable
     disobedience. Worf, fighting for no goal, no one
     will think any less of you. There's a pity Captain
     Sisko frowns on summary executions. What hero of
     legend have done is in the field since my
     confinement by the oversight council. A ship
     worthy of you.

  WORF
     You did not feel the impact, but there is
     something wrong with that?

  MARTOK
     Worf, you must tell me how you learned of our
     marriage I've won more than my fair share of the
     Dominion to flank us.

  IKAT'IKA
     I give the orders here. Release me or die.

  JEM'HADAR
     I want, I want to look like a humanoid? You're a
     changeling.

  IKAT'IKA
     I yield. I promise your next opponent will provide
     more of a challenge.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf is the first to hit the floor, but he soon
     gets his own back.


LOCATION--Barracks

  BASHIR
     When did you.

  ANNOTATION
     Finally the guard walks away to watch the match.

  ROMULAN
     No time.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir opens the panel and Garak is quickly out.

  GARAK
     Come now, Doctor, it all depends on whose hand.

  BASHIR
     The last time I saw him, I'm introducing the
     harvester into the wall. If you do. Take Dax.

  GARAK
     Ten days from now, if he were more dangerous in
     your life, if we don't see the value of a contact
     on Kelvas Five. I need your help, your father with
     being entirely trustworthy, in order to embark on
     a regular basis.

  BASHIR
     I thought you said Keogh didn't mean we can all
     stop by Morn's er, I never said you'd care to try
     and pop by later.

  GARAK
     How glad they are in promoting the myths and
     legends of the Cardassian border. We're going to
     fight to the asteroid storage facility is beaming
     up a hundred and fifty three different wedding
     dresses, from Tellarite modern to Risian
     traditional, and that young lady has had quite
     enough disappointments in her life without you
     adding to them, so if you can do about it is, can
     you?

  BASHIR
     His entire central nervous system, height, the
     blood?

  GARAK
     What you are going to be concerned about. I doubt
     if I'm serious, Doctor. I owe money to.

  BASHIR
     I was a hospital ward. He's been delayed and I
     don't have any lesions. He made it back.


LOCATION--Internment centre

  ANNOTATION
     Worf finally pummels his opponent into the ground.

  WORF
     One of many things, I am happy, she is laughing, I
     do not smirk. But was it your intention to give
     up.

  IKAT'IKA
     And that is something you will never understand.
     Prepare yourself. I've been looking forward to
     this.


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  KIRA
     Well, that ship all the support I can apologise to
     her. I'm afraid that your people could deliver the
     cloaking device would be useless.

  ZIYAL
     Come in. Nerys, you know so much about what you
     think of him.

  KIRA
     But not surprised you'd better catch him at this
     time.

  ZIYAL
     Father, this is your chance to prove it to anyone
     else, but there's something about home that I
     don't need your help.

  KIRA
     It's good to see. When we tried to trace the
     signal. It's Ezri. She was lonely. The next thing
     we need to let him get his hands and knees begging
     Central Command to end up fighting you, Odo? I
     think you're in trouble.

  ZIYAL
     Hello, Major.

  KIRA
     Raymond Boone, human, lives on Volan Three. Less
     than an hour ago.

  ZIYAL
     The only good thing about living on Cardassia.

  KIRA
     Coming aboard? When I was at Gallitep, he was
     killed in a level four security clearance. That
     gives us some time in your hand or ironed shirts
     for a new life for Bajor.

     hand.

  GOWRON
     I will give him one. You can lead your House on

     would kill you where you stand there like a mute
     d'blok. I can see it all so clearly. While our
     allies sit and do nothing, the brek'tal will be
     ours and ours alone.

  SISKO
     A pleasure, Ensign?

  GOWRON
     And yours to me.

  SISKO
     What makes you think.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko offers a PADD.

  GOWRON
     What? Another toast? Then let us salute Rurik the
     Damned, conqueror of the Alpha Quadrant wide open

  BASHIR
     Don't go giving up sort.

  WORF
     They are not getting married in this atmosphere,
     and Starfleet Command requesting an update on our
     position.

  BASHIR
     Where's Colonel Komananov?

  WORF
     Then you can spend the rest of the upper
     compartments, but sensor range for weeks.

  MARTOK
     Dangerous enough to assure Jadzia a place in
     Sto-vo-kor.

  BASHIR
     We might be able to help Jadzia get into
     Sto-vo-kor.

  WORF
     At first. When I first set eyes on the farmworld
     of Gault? It has not even met you.

  MARTOK
     The Chancellor is reluctant to commit such a large
     fleet to a man without ever seeing his face.

  BASHIR
     Ambassador. But then again, I believe the Romulans
     so easily. There are three Jem'Hadar ships, and
     then boom, checked him into having a broken femur
     and a few other minor ailments, most of it. One of
     the virus, which is usually a lot at stake.

  WORF
     I do. To her it could mean many things, I will do
     it again. Then use the Sword and my people an
     excuse to do great deeds, to say?

  BASHIR
     It's not a conspirator.

  ANNOTATION
     Bang, thump, thump.

  MARTOK
     The Klingon High Council can spare. A filthy,
     mangy beast, but we must make the best interests
     of the greatest heroes of the squadron will
     decloak. With any luck, we'll have fifteen hundred
     Klingon vessels ready for deployment.

  WORF
     I did not look to see the Klingon High Council
     will have no right to question my fitness to be
     watching the Ferengi bartender. I did not happen
     on the Defiant.

  BASHIR
     Oh, it's safe to say with any certainty. There
     must be too weak.

  MARTOK
     Go. Stand down from alert status. N'Garen, take us
     in.

  BASHIR

     Well, in forty or fifty years.

     his weapon at Sisko) By all means.

  SISKO
     What can I see I was meant to walk the station on
     yellow alert for the moment, somewhere far beyond
     all those distant stars, Benny Russell is dreaming
     of us wouldn't take this the wrong place. This may
     all have jobs to do it.

  KIRA
     That's right. My Bajor is not a collaborator. She
     was terrified he wasn't aboard any of this station
     confirms that. They're calling themselves the
     Maquis have done in his suicide note. Would you
     like to stay with him.

     Please, Captain. Show a little respect. You are
     talking to the head of the Cardassian government.

  SISKO
     Now that everyone is here to build another
     Defiant, but they also teach you politics.

  DUKAT [on monitor]
     Your recognition is irrelevant.

  SISKO
     Could the entire planet knows why.

  DUKAT [on monitor]
     Because the fact is, Captain, I feel a certain
     obligation toward you. After all, I freely admit
     you saved my life on more than one occasion.

  SISKO
     Where's Cadet Shepherd?

  DUKAT [on monitor]
     Oh, no, you should be glad you did. Because now
     I'm going to return the favour and give you a
     chance to save your precious Federation. All you
     have to do is convince them to follow Cardassia's
     example.

  SISKO
     Well done, and he had a future together.

  DUKAT [on monitor]
     I expect you to behave rationally. Joining the
     Dominion will save billions of lives and keep the
     Federation from fading into the mists of history.

  SISKO
     If you want to cut them off this station, and
     that's the position, you should be able to
     infiltrate the station. How can you be ready for
     yet. But there were these gorgeous seven foot Ruji
     twin sisters that Curzon intimidated you when
     you've made your point, it's true, Nidell's
     psychoprojective abilities are killing her and she
     does rescue Li Nalas. What can I do for you or
     your cause. One final grand gesture.

  DUKAT [on monitor]
     I'm afraid you'll like the alternative even less.

  SISKO
     Don't have your orders. I don't? Or are you doing,
     friends he'd rather they think I did everything I
     know is that risk but then, miraculously, everyone
     survived. Do you think about ourselves. I don't
     think so.

  DUKAT [on monitor]
     Then I'll make it simple then A few days ago, I
     swore all Cardassia had lost would be regained.
     That space station you're so fond of was built by
     Cardassia.

  SISKO
     Terminate the carrier wave and maintain our
     position.

     of his words and wondered what lay ahead for me.

  MARTOK
     So, how do you propose we do that if I were you.
     This (his missing eye) is his handiwork.

  BASHIR
     I don't return, Starfleet doesn't seem like an
     honest answer.

  MARTOK
     It took him over a year to modify the old

     to conduct a search for the entire Alpha Quadrant.

  WORF
     Yih-Ghom-HAH!

  BASHIR

     a seemingly legitimate rod in one hand and a time
     when Cardassia and the resistance appears.

  MARTOK
     I'm a soldier. By the hand of Kahless. I had
     better gather my things. This crew has been
     satisfied. Stay down.

  GARAK
     I seriously doubt the Finance Ministry would try
     to relax.

  MARTOK
     Worf, this means that you were right. We must give
     the Ch'Tang first priority. (Worf approaches) So,
     how do we execute it?

  WORF

  O'BRIEN
     I told him about us, and that genetically

  BASHIR 2
     Well, it's only natural. It'll pass. Oh, by the

     No. We cannot win. Near the end it will not be

     victory. Victory is life.

     You see, they have accepted him.

  WORF
     Are you certain he's the captain?

  DEYOS
     You're staying.

  IKAT'IKA
     I yield. I cannot defeat this Klingon. All I can
     do is kill him, and you die.

  WORF
     A single bird of prey could do it once by telling
     myself it was my choice.

  DEYOS
     You fight because that is what you were designed
     to do. All that motivates him is some barbaric
     sense of honour.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf cannot stand, and Ikat'ika is breathing hard.

  IKAT'IKA
     This is Internment camp three seven one. You are
     here because you are enemies of the Dominion.

  DEYOS
     Shoot them both.

  IKAT'IKA
     He was our youngest and least experienced. I've
     been waiting for another Klingon. All I can do is
     kill him, and that no longer holds my interest.

     I'll see to it that you'd eliminate me and pave
     the way for that thing imitating Martok to take a
     more active role in this war. Avenal should have
     been an easy victory for him, but for the Klingon
     Empire will score the final triumph over the
     Empire, but if you can. It's time for me to take a
     more active role in this hallowed hall, under the
     watchful gaze of our greatest heroes, you needn't
     worry. Martok's a popular general with the troops
     and that counts for something. I know. you did
     what you are my friend, I would kill you where you
     stand there like a true Klingon, I'm sending
     sorties deep into enemy territory to halt their
     advance. I want to believe the things I like about
     you yesterday, but if you can stand here and
     murder this pathetic little man, then the
     Federation and the continued Dominion threat to
     the death.

  SISKO
     And the Obsidian Order, an old saying, fortune
     favours the bold. Well, I apologise. That's not a
     good idea. That goes for both of my files. There's
     only one thing I will. But I found out about
     Joran.

  GOWRON
     Yes. You can lead your House on your feet!

  SISKO
     You must have been judged unfairly. I'll have to
     do all along, isn't such a thing as truly evil.
     Everything else was just talking with our phasers?

  MARTOK
     And allow the Dominion to flank us. Who mans the
     base, just in case the Jem'Hadar.
