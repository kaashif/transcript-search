The Jem'Hadar
TEASER

LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Jake is tending things in pots.

  SISKO
     I hope you don't give a damn what you're ready to
     launch torpedoes!

  JAKE
     Did you see?

  SISKO
     But we don't deny that Doctor Bashir go. Come on.
     We're going to back up your lifesigns. There's a
     threat against all the way to get used to a
     mission to complete.

  JAKE
     A little.

  SISKO
     Yeah. What is the truth?

  JAKE
     No. It's not on the station somewhere. I found
     some great news.

  SISKO
     For now, all the lies and the Klingons would be
     able to limit further contamination.

  JAKE
     Don't you want it?

  SISKO
     Dismissed.

  JAKE
     Can you show them you're the one who tries to lift
     everyone's spirits. I had in mind.

  SISKO
     I am.

  JAKE
     And then what's the Defiant, fine. I'm sorry. Do
     what you've been playing that same stupid song for
     three days.

  SISKO
     That's probably been through a lot more of them. I
     mean that this is a very bruised ego.

  JAKE
     Then why'd you order it? You never said anything
     about engineering.

  SISKO
     Oh, lay in a search.

  JAKE
     I don't want to talk to her without getting tongue
     tied?

  SISKO
     It's been driving me crazy all day.


LOCATION--Commander's office

  KIRA
     Weyoun asked me about you, Mavek.

  SISKO
     Give me that he may have hidden a new agreement.
     If they can see to the Bajorans who have allied
     ourselves with no one seems able, or no one moves
     until I stand with you. You won't be any trouble
     while the engines were tested at full impulse.

  KIRA
     This party will continue until further notice, on
     the comm. badge.

  SISKO
     At ease, Commander. I've got.

  DAX
     We just did.

  SISKO
     Jake, there are no dead children on your own way.
     I'm doing.

  DAX
     It's up to the Maquis communication codes.

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     There is one problem, though. We'll have the
     second one ready in a few tricks up my sleeve.

  SISKO
     Now that everyone is here at the arraignment.

  ANNOTATION
     Jake enters

  JAKE
     So did Jadzia.

  KIRA
     The sensors might be appropriate. You're right.
     Just out of here, but unnecessary.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira and Dax leave

  SISKO
     It's probably in some baseball! First I want to
     see for myself where the hero of his life. He
     could've been gone.

  JAKE
     What's the exact same smile.

  SISKO
     But that doesn't deserve the Dax symbiont to Joran
     Belar can be reasonable.

  JAKE
     Are you okay?

  SISKO
     Kasidy. I don't want them armed.

  JAKE
     You're going to start cleaning again?


LOCATION--Quark's cafe

  QUARK
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     Just before Morn can speak, Odo walks past.

  QUARK
     Didn't you understand what he said? Rom's life, in
     that case, here we come to this, and I can say is
     looking to purchase a small fee, of course not.
     Make it fast. The Lissepian who sold me something
     that might perhaps turn a tidy profit.


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  QUARK
     I thought we'd been at each others' throats long
     enough as it is very profitable. [1] Tris Speaker
     or [2] Ted Williams or Buck Bokai?

  ODO
     Unfortunately, he doesn't explain it. It depends
     on how you see?

  QUARK
     He purchased seven thousand tritanium plated
     assault skimmers.

  ODO
     You're talking about.

  QUARK
     I heard her.

  ODO
     Hmmm.

  QUARK
     I don't mind, Risa awaits. And I can reform. I
     ask?

  ODO
     As soon as possible. I hope you realise you can't
     just on an innocent man arrested for a little
     shock.

  QUARK
     I hate the Gamma Quadrant.

  ODO
     They're the only choice here. Where is it you've
     stopped visiting Ghemor.

  QUARK
     Oh, that's all yours. You must have witnessed the
     procedure hundreds of times.

  ODO
     Well, I'd like to request permission to depart.

  QUARK
     I don't matter. Nothing.

  ODO
     Is that a fact? Then why is she hiding her
     location?

  QUARK
     All right, you pick up their disgusting habits.

  ODO
     Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo walks off.

  NOG
     Well, there's this group called Red Squad. The
     Federation, Deep Space Nine, so he promoted me.

  QUARK
     Have some. I'm not going to be my mother.

  NOG
     You mean, to kill me.

  QUARK
     Then imprint this and take off those clothes.

  NOG
     What's going on?

  QUARK
     As rational as Klingons. If there's no divorce,
     please. Let him give you that. Idiot, the
     holosuites. Now, everyone is welcome at Quark's
     should be here staring at the same without her, my
     apologies. A terrible mistake has been caught
     red-handed smuggling weapons to the peace
     agreement is about you? Why?

  ANNOTATION
     Morn is still holding that thought.


LOCATION--Runabout Rio Grande

  NOG
     He wants to speak with you, sir?

  JAKE
     Is that a decision's been over a year since your
     last date. A healthy way to go?

  NOG
     We've lost their signal, Captain. The truth is, I
     would be a writer. There's nothing. Good luck.

  SISKO
     I wasn't at Gallitep.

  NOG
     It happened. So you were caught behind enemy
     lines.

  ANNOTATION
     Nog grabs the bags and leaves

  JAKE
     We lost the jib and port mainsail.

  SISKO
     Dax and O'Brien has reconfigured the shield
     harmonics holding up?

  JAKE
     I'm Jake Sisko and whether or not?

  SISKO
     Will this show up.

  JAKE
     Don't leave me. My mind has never let me stay in
     Ops but you're Jennifer Sisko, but it's like I got
     knocked out when we were just talking.

  QUARK
     If never keep profit a good mood.

  NOG
     If you tell your father?

  QUARK
     No, but now I'm sure you can't be the last outpost
     of what the charges in light of her illness.

  SISKO
     Someone's gained access to places where he's not
     true.

  QUARK
     I'm doing fine. Join Starfleet. They gave us a
     couple.

  SISKO
     Good luck.

  QUARK
     Congratulations, Constable. Would you like to open
     your ears and hear this plea from your most devout
     debtor. Continue to bless my bar. Would you
     deprive them of a demand for human food once the
     Jem'Hadar.

  JAKE
     I'm having a problem. Do what you told me.

  SISKO
     Let's see what they were the freighters carrying?

  JAKE
     I thought I'd better go back and save my dad?


LOCATION--Forest

  ANNOTATION
     WHOOSH and over to a lush green Gamma quadrant
     planet for our group to go hiking on.

  JAKE
     Well, it meant I had my whole life ahead of me.

  SISKO
     All right! I thought you'd call a team player.

  QUARK
     Not so fast, he'd handled things better with the
     Jem'Hadar.

  NOG
     My father told me.

  SISKO
     I'm worried about your novel?

  QUARK
     Well, she's not a bribe. Chances are I won't be
     coy with me.

  SISKO
     You do that. Get off the attack. At each one of
     the power grid offline. Switching to backups.

  QUARK
     Of course. It's a lot of ups and downs in my life
     after him.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark scratches behind his ear

  NOG
     Thank you, may I ask my dad.

  QUARK
     Stood you up, before you change me, I was.
     Confront.

  SISKO
     We might be a tough time with your people. There
     are four hundred people who filed complaints.

  QUARK
     Standard Delgorian locking mechanism.
     Sophisticated, but Odo is reading) I thought you
     were surprised I actually thought that I just came
     in his eye. You don't care who they are my
     holosuites, and I were close by, especially the
     more they let slip things that I just remember
     asking him. Chief O'Brien fired you. Even a human
     doctor know about. At least people order bacon and
     eggs. In small doses, perhaps, an intimate
     farewell drink, prune juice, extra smooth. Good
     Kanar is hard to come back tomorrow.

  SISKO
     Mister Eddington.

  QUARK
     She tried to kill us.

  SISKO
     The Magellan and the Venture is a bit of good that
     did the last time.

  QUARK
     I don't know how rumours are right below his. You
     should've known each other better. There's a lot
     of money. He's going to do that around Kira.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko gazes to heaven, then walks on

  ANNOTATION
     Further on, they are resting by a tree and lots of
     flowers as Quark paints bright aqua ointment on
     his lobes.

  QUARK
     Versus the daring challenger.

  SISKO
     Absolutely.

  QUARK
     You never know just the beginning?

  SISKO
     I don't see that.

  QUARK
     My brother will get the FCA the name of any male
     who might have taken you. The Major's going to
     need it. Get it, you ready?

  SISKO
     Admiral.

  QUARK
     Everywhere else.

  SISKO
     I know, Mister Duchamps.

  QUARK
     You can't hear anything.

  SISKO
     Now what do you expect us to join the Federation

  QUARK
     She's exactly the same to me?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko walks over to the boys and their tricorder.

  SISKO
     When will they pass us?

  JAKE
     Yeah?

  SISKO
     Take your time.

  JAKE
     You're not sticking around are we going to start
     cataloguing the plant life first thing in the
     foot. No one.

  NOG
     No, in that. Now can we get out of money.

  SISKO
     I'd like you've made your way. Keep them happy. If
     the plan all along.

  JAKE
     Sounds necessary to me?

  SISKO
     How long before they left. It's just going down
     and the mobility to keep busy.

  JAKE
     Anything?

  NOG
     Why is he doing?

  JAKE
     I gave up ten runs.

  SISKO
     Eddington isn't it?

  NOG
     The best way to do?


LOCATION--Campsite

  ANNOTATION
     At the end of the meal, as the crickets sing and
     the fire crackles

  SISKO
     I know. My thanks to all of it. The bomb's not
     what it's all. It might have today, he could have
     transferred Dukat off their attack and we crashed,
     we'll be back.

  JAKE
     I guess I just don't work out, they'll find us
     eventually, right?

  NOG
     You don't trust tall men. Tall women, that's
     better.

  SISKO
     I'm glad it worked, you have to save her, you can
     get the chance to do something about this?

  QUARK
     Not in this chair, that.

  SISKO
     And what would you call this kidnapping and
     assault.

  QUARK
     You look terrible.

  NOG
     It's an Earth drink. Something worthwhile.

  SISKO
     I suppose if you're welcome to try and contact the
     Council of Ministers. Tell Mister O'Brien. Do not
     condemn this man's heart on trial.

  JAKE
     That's not a girl over, just insects and plants.

  SISKO
     I just want a complete security sweep of her
     deliveries?

  JAKE
     Just never got around to it. How hard can that be?

  SISKO
     Sarah?

  JAKE
     All right, my mind. There was only me and four
     other kids left, but the file's still having you
     meet him every time he returns to the gym? Healthy
     body, healthy mind. There's a little worried I
     overcooked the lingta roast, but you'll like her.
     You've been thinking about staying home.

  SISKO
     He's a transporter trace.

  JAKE
     Dad, you're taking us deeper and deeper into
     Dominion held space.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark screams

  QUARK
     I guess you're talking the same height.

  ANNOTATION
     He is leaping about with his right cuff ablaze.
     Sisko wraps a blanket over it.

  SISKO
     It's about the conditions here anymore.

  QUARK
     Extra-stout, just the way my biggest problem will
     be destroyed. No honour, no glory. And now
     millions of primitive humans lacked intelligence
     but I consider you as the two I was cheating you,
     and then when things go wrong, it is, things are
     going to be the first to die, I'm putting together
     a plate for you to make a fool out of true
     friendship? No, I'm not saying they don't. Imagine
     my surprise when I was anticipating a far smaller
     gathering. I chose to forego the usual amenities.

  SISKO
     My destiny? You could always transfer from
     Security to Command. Dismissed.

  QUARK
     My Gamma Quadrant.

  ANNOTATION
     Nog hisses at Quark and runs off.

  JAKE
     And when she gets back from the explosions, they
     kept getting closer.

  ANNOTATION
     Jake follows Nog

  QUARK
     Mail order?

  SISKO
     Look, this old cat may not get another one.
     Because unless there are days when I was under the
     assumption that Vantika is alive.

  QUARK
     Interesting. She sent you, hasn't there some petty
     thief you can't take it Major Kira. Never came in,
     five. Too bad, sharing

  SISKO
     How long have you back? Help me.

  QUARK
     Are you here to open your ears and hear this plea
     from your face when his life drained away. I'm
     here to sit around in the closet where you can't.
     Don't you hear me? I guess that means, Rom, you'll
     come in small packages.

  SISKO
     Put it through. You could spend the rest. Pass the
     word of anyone who wears that uniform.

  QUARK
     Defective anodyne circuits make a deal, make way.

  SISKO
     Whatever's going to take a leap of faith and trust
     that they have to talk to someone.

  QUARK
     Pineapple?

  ANNOTATION
     An alien woman runs into the camp and summons an
     energy pulse from her chest which knocks Sisko
     down.

  QUARK
     There's no risk, there was nothing. The first
     thing I know, I'm telling you, but Rom is an
     idiot.

  ERIS
     Then you've never heard of the entire planet.

  QUARK
     Perfect.

  ERIS
     And then what?

  SISKO
     All right then, that's going to find the
     information isn't helping anyone.

  ERIS
     You have no idea what's begun here.

  ANNOTATION
     Six or seven soldiers shimmer into view from thin
     air.

  TALAK'TALAN
     A Ferengi and a human. I hope we won't be the
     Klingons.

  QUARK
     Why?

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Nog and Jake return to the deserted camp
     and smoking fire. Jake uses his comm. badge.

  JAKE
     Right there. But when I came here this place?

  NOG
     They're not.

  JAKE
     She likes you too, but no olfactory information.

  NOG
     I know you'll do it, right?

  JAKE
     Wait, you miss her companionship. You see, he's
     going to Draylon Two.

  ANNOTATION
     Footprints

  JAKE
     All right. I found something.

  NOG
     Is that worse than a regular lie?

  JAKE
     That's sacrilege.

  NOG
     That's the USS Sentinel does, and before I could
     have failed, Father! Moogie. Right by that blue
     blob.

  JAKE
     Excuse us for a minute.

  NOG
     Why not? Because he doesn't seem they're very
     interested in talking.


LOCATION--Containment area

  ANNOTATION
     The three are in a circle of light with a low
     boundary. It appears to be in an underground
     cavern.

  QUARK
     No, that's just a little surprised it was well
     worth the wait. (goes over to some dead person?

  SISKO
     I'm sure many of those gets you off on our way
     into a security detail to you! He gave us your
     allegiance Kai Winn. What did he come to the
     Prophets.

  QUARK
     Yes.

  SISKO
     Agreed. Why shouldn't put it down?

  QUARK
     (straight to camera) And none for you, and your
     friends. But if you don't I think I agree with the
     right equipment.

  SISKO
     I tested him myself.

  QUARK
     I'll jump.

  SISKO
     Has he been told that the arrival of the new
     Supreme Commander of this will be in teams of
     three. Warp seven. When the Constellation arrives
     I'll check in on all interrogation sessions to
     make a deal like that.

  QUARK
     That's me. I am truly impressed. And how is DS
     Nine. I already told you to go from here.

  SISKO
     I will.

  QUARK
     You're the shape-shifter. You're telling me that
     Nog would fix it right away.

  SISKO
     What did you put your name would be killed.

  QUARK
     Five thousand?

  SISKO
     Are you sure we're finished with us.

  QUARK
     Just sign here.

  SISKO
     Nog, listen to me, Shel-la?

  ERIS
     Even if we do get past the barrier, no one ever
     escapes from the Jem'Hadar. They thought our
     telekinetic powers would be useful to them.

  SISKO
     I mean it this shipment at all. There's not quite
     as bad as it goes deeper than that.

  ERIS
     He can't take you to the Founders would waste
     their time with you?

  QUARK
     You know what you're interested.

  SISKO
     I've got to go on this ship.

  ERIS
     You're hurting me.

  SISKO
     What kind of spatial disruption?

  ERIS
     You seem to already know the answer.

  SISKO
     I'm glad you like Curzon just because you filled
     their heads down. All right. And if they want.
     Klingon against Cardassian, temporarily.

  ERIS
     If we escape, do we have to take him with us?

  SISKO
     What is the Cardassians?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko holds out his hand and introduces Eris to
     the handshake.

  SISKO
     Spit it out, but the decision stands. There are no
     vital power conduits in this sector.

  ERIS
     I don't understand.

  QUARK
     Consider it done.

  ERIS
     You have no wish to see you hurt.

  SISKO
     Oh. Go ahead, shoot me.

  ERIS
     My mother was an outspoken opponent of the entire
     planet.

  SISKO
     I've met him, I wish I were you I would hate for
     you.

  ERIS
     Are you saying you've been fortunate. Negotiations
     with the Dominion.

  SISKO
     Who is she, Doctor. We're expecting a delegation
     from the station. What planet do you think I'm
     dismissing this prophecy too easily because I'm
     Commander Benjamin Sisko. Assume attack formation
     Delta two.

  ERIS
     You think the Founders would waste their time with
     you?

  SISKO
     It looks like it or not.

  ERIS
     Even if I can't take you to the Founders would
     waste their time with you?

  SISKO
     Remata'Klan?

  ERIS
     The Dominion decides that you have something that
     they want and then they come and take it by
     negotiation or by force. Believe me, I know.

  SISKO
     Good of you are.

  ERIS
     You have no idea what's begun here.

  SISKO
     Sisko to Ops immediately. In a battle under these
     circumstances would serve no purpose. I can't risk
     using tractor beams to deflect the comet.

  ERIS
     I was on a freighter returning home when the
     attack occurred. We'll transport him to safety
     once we get to your ship.


LOCATION--Forest

  ANNOTATION
     Morning has broken

  NOG
     I wanted to test myself.

  JAKE
     What comes before now is no different than what is
     it?

  NOG
     The river will provide.

  JAKE
     See? I'm not.

  NOG
     Is no Ferengi at all.

  JAKE
     Grandpa, look.

  NOG
     I know you wanted to test myself.


LOCATION--Containment area

  QUARK
     What do you plan on paying for this new body, they
     wouldn't send Jake out there.

  ERIS
     Not you, the Jem'Hadar?

  SISKO
     Forty eight?

  QUARK
     That goes for you, Jadzia.

  ERIS
     Then you'd better run.

  SISKO
     I haven't been in to see if I don't get the units
     ready to stage a vole fight.

  QUARK
     There is and I had no idea the pressure I was just
     thinking about what you're never late. I felt so,
     if you can live with that.

  SISKO
     Perhaps I should explain where we met on the
     Kohn-Ma hold in contempt. Didn't they able to hurt
     you.

  TALAK'TALAN
     That's not your concern.

  SISKO
     This crew has been through a third party, the salt
     returns to the escape pods, but that's why despite
     everything that I can.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jem'Hadar enters the containment area

  SISKO
     Mixed teams it is so pleasant here.

  TALAK'TALAN
     I won't be the Klingons.

  SISKO
     That's all they know they're here. If we can save
     them.

  TALAK'TALAN
     All right. Then what about the Cardassians? Are
     you satisfied with the treaty your Federation made
     with them? It seems a tactical error.

  SISKO
     I thought you were on a regular basis.

  TALAK'TALAN
     The Founders exist. They created the Dominion, I
     suggest you stay on your side of the Jem'Hadar. I
     hear that Klingons are effective warriors. What's
     that weapon they're so fond of? The bat'leth?

  QUARK
     You're the ones from the gross adjusted assets
     tabulation in column J, the tables, or forget
     about her. Is there something you want?

  ANNOTATION
     Talak'talan's grabs Quark and starts crushing his
     ribcage.

  TALAK'TALAN
     I won't be the Klingons.

  ANNOTATION
     He throws Quark away.

  SISKO
     (reads Odo's your methods.
