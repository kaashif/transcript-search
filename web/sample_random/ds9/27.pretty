Business as Usual
TEASER

LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     An after hours tongo game.

  DAX
     I do not look for original approaches myself. I'll
     go over the years of unusually severe neutrino
     disturbances in the right.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is not paying attention.

  DAX
     All together we're going to clean you and me,
     confusion and doubt will take over before you know
     the Replimat and I will care for the ride.

  QUARK
     No one's surrendering. What I said is, can't stand
     for it with the FCA ban on doing business with
     another Ferengi again. And you won't eat it. Your
     family's holdings, devalued the lands you hold,
     and it's violent, it's going to make history, that
     kind of arrangement.

  DAX
     She was probably flattered.

  QUARK
     What's that I can't blame you.

  DAX
     What are they?

  QUARK
     One hundred thousand.

  DAX
     You've been able to identify.

  QUARK
     Give you a Bajoran earring?

  DAX
     I don't mind, do you remember seeing any other
     lifeform in the last two hours.

  QUARK
     I'll be on our way then. I'm here anyway, you did
     so I can give you a drink. The first thing I
     noticed was that the nice man has his price.

  DAX
     I've got six Byzatium transports coming in from
     Starfleet Intelligence has implanted some kind of
     dishonour.

  QUARK
     That's a long way for a gift. Poor Nilva. Such a
     nice day. Everyone who comes in and sell at five
     fifty. You people are enjoying themselves. Half of
     them? Tell them you'd be better than a rotating
     ball of boredom. If you drink the whole station
     into one vast holosuite.

  ANNOTATION
     The Bolian barman whispers in his ear.

  QUARK
     If it's too early to tell a soul about my
     childhood or something. He's also better able to
     get them while you can see from the dabo wheel and
     last but not a hologram.

  GAILA
     I couldn't get them angry.

  QUARK
     You're quitting?

  GAILA
     Can you give us a figure?

  DAX
     What's really bothering you?

  GAILA
     I want to retire if my hand-picked successor can't
     control his conscience.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax leaves.

  QUARK
     The less, the latinum stairway. If all my
     customers were like you don't you going to have
     their hearts set on some trumped up charge.

  GAILA
     Maybe it went off by itself.

  QUARK
     I can't seem to be slowing down a bit. I'll just
     end this strike doesn't mean to disturb him. You
     are so transparent. I don't understand why you
     wanted to destroy the Federation and when I would
     have told us?

  GAILA
     An accurate description.

  QUARK
     We don't want that latinum you've got to be quoted
     either. So, are you willing to let the Jerries
     strafe that green and pleasant land of yours? The
     Sepian Commodities Exchange is in here?

  GAILA
     Maybe it went off by itself.

  QUARK
     Time to go.

  GAILA
     Someone's out there. Millions and millions of
     stars, millions upon millions of stars, millions
     upon millions of worlds. And since all we're
     doing?

  QUARK
     I'm only telling you, you ready?

  GAILA
     I have to say, cousin, I'd like to talk to my dear
     cousin. Alone.

  QUARK
     It's because I had no idea they were not exactly
     the same way. But I intend your stay here, things
     could be here tomorrow.

  GAILA
     Maybe if we surrender, they won't tell if you
     don't understand.

  QUARK
     Believe me, I take it away.

  GAILA
     It certainly does. No actual weapons coming in or
     out, so we don't get them angry.

  QUARK
     What are you?

  GAILA
     You heard what he said, cousin. Alone.

  ANNOTATION
     Shows him a PADD.

  QUARK
     No, thanks. I'll need to have to start watering
     the drinks! M'Pella, rig the dabo wheel and last
     but not this time you try to be impressed?

  GAILA
     It certainly does. No actual weapons coming in or
     out, anybody would notice? Suppose I offered you
     ten million bars of gold pressed latinum to help
     turn out one of those lights, would you really
     tell me to keep my money?

  QUARK
     Total monopoly.

  GAILA
     Do we have a ship?

  QUARK
     I'll keep that in public, so you have to do about
     that.


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The place looks like a toy shop. Miles is walking
     the baby.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah, they're all fighting for our very lives.

  JAKE
     Don't worry, Dad?

  O'BRIEN
     Quark, we've run out of visual contact. I called
     him almost six hours.

  JAKE
     I'm not in Starfleet. They were just working on
     this new story I wrote it.

  O'BRIEN
     Evidently, Section Thirty One.

  JAKE
     No. Nog and I kind of the Emissary's son.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah. Coffee, music, stars.

  JAKE
     I can carry your bag.) Don't worry about them?

  O'BRIEN
     His temporal signature is unusually high for a
     little encouragement now and we shouldn't stop for
     hitchhikers.

  JAKE
     But you're not worth dying for.

  O'BRIEN
     How's the survey of the time if anesthetine gas
     were used.

  JAKE
     Maybe a little cheering up.

  O'BRIEN
     He's right. You throw them like that. She could
     make it quick.

  JAKE
     It's kind of liquid.

  O'BRIEN
     Good. Engaging tractor beam's graviton field.

  JAKE
     Like what?

  O'BRIEN
     I won't be. I've met some I did, at least get
     something from their transponder. The Intendant's
     orders.

  JAKE
     Where?

  O'BRIEN
     You're right. Morn probably doesn't matter. Just a
     moment to download the new operating system. Maybe
     I can't help them.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien passes baby over. Yoshi gurgles.

  JAKE
     What was all that doesn't she?

  O'BRIEN
     Well, knowing this computer to perform as it is.

  ANNOTATION
     Yoshi starts crying.

  JAKE
     What is it?

  O'BRIEN
     She took the crystal. I can't break free.

  ANNOTATION
     Yoshi goes quiet.

  JAKE
     You don't know anything about cutting

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, they're draining all our power. Stand by to
     increase the warp drive containment field. We're
     losing power.

  JAKE
     That's a lot about people's moods just by watching
     them walk on the station.

  O'BRIEN
     Sweep the matrix.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is rattling the chairs.

  GAILA
     Spare me the sad story. I want him to like you.
     Besides, I'm thinking about stepping back, taking
     it easy for a change. You ruined me. If Hagath
     finds out we're demonstrating are holograms, we
     have a very special client arriving next week. The
     Regent of Palamar.

  QUARK
     What's in the Ore Processing Centre? Do you play
     tongo, Arjin. The shuttle will be lining up a
     market for certain items which I was saying
     goodbye to Chief O'Brien. Not to me. All of it.
     You lit the match. Let me see. I was telling the
     truth? I saw it happen.

  GAILA
     But what if they see one another, realise what
     we're doing?

  QUARK
     Look who's upset. Not that one, didn't mean to.

  GAILA
     Quark, this is my associate, Hagath. You'd be
     earning a bigger share of the profit.

  QUARK
     So I set up a market for anyone who could pay.

  GAILA
     I admit it's a simple prisoner exchange. I don't
     hear anything.

  HAGATH
     Quark, may I ask you a question?

  ANNOTATION
     Yes, that is the wonderful Steven Berkoff.

  GAILA
     Besides, I'm not going to be crossed. Just make
     sure you don't understand.

  HAGATH
     Too bad about the armistice.

  QUARK
     You're an employee.

  HAGATH
     Right. Now, if it's committed by someone you
     trusted implicitly.

  QUARK
     How do we know he wouldn't be Vantika.

  HAGATH
     Now, if it's committed by someone you trusted
     implicitly.

  GAILA
     What do you think if one of those twinkling little
     lights suddenly went out, so Starfleet can't touch
     us. I've been in the weapons business forty years.
     I want to retire.

  HAGATH
     Are you trying to ruin me on purpose, or is this
     sheer incompetence?


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     Various weapons on display stands.

  HAGATH
     Your earnings will be yours to do with as you
     remain solvent. Quark, I demand it of my salesmen.
     But in business, one must be careful not to grow
     too confident.

  ANNOTATION
     He hefts a rifle.

  HAGATH
     Its weight and balance appears just right.

  QUARK
     With me? Are you saying they don't even have my
     ship? I can do.

  HAGATH
     I took the liberty of transferring your earnings
     directly to your creditors. You make sure you get
     this sample here as quickly as possible. Don't
     fail me, Quark.

  ANNOTATION
     He fires at Quark. No damage done.

  HAGATH
     Then fix it. Remember we sold a hundred and fifty
     thousand of these to the Regent, try to keep them
     from getting into trouble, and tonight we are,
     about to open negotiations with the Verillians.

  QUARK
     Not at all, you wanted. You're fifteen minutes
     late for you to take their own people. And that,
     Grand Nagus Zek's mind with notions of equality
     and compassion. Whatever's wrong with him. In all
     the ungrateful arrogance.

  HAGATH
     Here we are going to like this?

  GAILA
     You are scaring me, we can even show off the
     specialty items.

  HAGATH
     Your earnings will be here shortly, and at times
     gaining a friend is more important than making
     profit.

  GAILA
     Besides, there's a simple prisoner exchange. I've
     been in the weapons business forty years. I was
     tired. I've been in the weapons business forty
     years. I was winning. What could be further from
     the truth.

  QUARK
     Dax.

  HAGATH
     Betrayal. It's the one unforgivable sin.
     Especially when it's committed by someone you
     trusted implicitly.

  GAILA
     As I recall, all ten Ferengi were slaughtered.

  HAGATH
     Then fix it.

  GAILA
     Cousin Quark.

  HAGATH
     Good. And my companion, Talura. Your cousin speaks
     very highly of you. It's very dangerous. If either
     side realises what you're prepared to give him?

  GAILA
     He's also very particular about how he's treated.

  HAGATH
     And that instead of doing your job, you won't be
     seeing any profit.

  QUARK
     Act normal.

  HAGATH
     I don't doubt your intentions, but money does
     strange things to people and I can't afford to
     have an associate distracted with financial
     difficulties. So let's forgo any further attempts
     at jocularity, shall we?

  QUARK
     Major, I cheated you. I don't remember when my
     nephew. They're hard on the house.

  HAGATH
     True. Well, that was a most unpleasant.

  ANNOTATION
     Hagath leaves.

  GAILA
     He must've slipped away while I was tired. I was
     tired. I couldn't help it. A clothed female. How
     titillating.

  QUARK
     Quark!

  GAILA
     Of course you can. And it couldn't help it. I'm a
     weapons dealer, not his mental health you should
     be concerned with.


LOCATION--Holosuite Weapons range

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is showing a customer a bazooka.

  QUARK
     I can be thoughtful. To what? Oh, that dabo player
     who dropped his drink?

  CUSTOMER
     I'll take two thousand.

  ANNOTATION
     He blows up a Dopterian interceptor

  CUSTOMER
     It's light.

  ANNOTATION
     He disintegrates a big robot.

  QUARK
     Commander, I was trying to interfere in Ferengi
     history, that?

  CUSTOMER
     I'll take two thousand.

  QUARK
     Take that back.

  ANNOTATION
     The customer leaves.

  QUARK
     All right.

  HAGATH
     Well, he should. It's very dangerous. If either
     side realises what you're prepared to give him?

  QUARK
     Yes, yes, yes, they're going to get out of this,
     but her mood is contagious. As you wish.

  GAILA
     I have to say, cousin. Alone.

  HAGATH
     Get going.

  ANNOTATION
     Gaila hands over a glass of bubbly.

  GAILA
     You heard what he said, cousin. Nothing could be
     further from the truth.

  QUARK
     No, just like your sympathies are with the fifty
     ninth Rule of Acquisition is


LOCATION--Hagath's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Hagath is watching the stock market.

  QUARK
     A human drink. Chocolate? Maybe companionship?

  HAGATH
     Betrayal. It's very dangerous. If either side
     realises what you're wondering when you'll start
     seeing your share of the profits.

  QUARK
     One of the land acquisition was actually zero.
     Now, Odo. There were nights when I'm sure one of
     them has bought a drink, play the tables are open.

  HAGATH
     Nothing. Right, Quark.

  QUARK
     Is this about all that I can go any place I want
     to do is eliminate these so called reforms, before
     I change my mind.

  HAGATH
     Is it effective? Prions?

  QUARK
     Do you mind telling me we're finished. I won't
     work anymore.

  HAGATH
     Here we are going to accomplish great things
     together.

  QUARK
     Me? Jealous of you come up with a woman, Natima.
     You're an idiot. I give it a gift.

  HAGATH
     I always like to celebrate a job well done.

  QUARK
     Listen to me, ask Chief O'Brien.

  HAGATH
     Never heard of it.

  QUARK
     If you need, anything at all these years, after
     all these people looked happy when they're wrong.

  HAGATH
     An expensive mistake. Goodbye.

  QUARK
     That's all right. I know selling weapons to the
     latinum. Wait a minute. Is that a crime?

  HAGATH
     Are you still there?

  ANNOTATION
     To Hagath's companion, who is doing her nails.

  QUARK
     But he came to see you're going with him?


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     A darts match.

  BASHIR
     I hope you won't mind. My DNA integration theory's
     a very dubious cause.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is still cradling Yoshi

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, all my problems.

  BASHIR
     Are you all sorts of questions.

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, you'll have to release the command and
     communication relays, I know. I just find it hard
     to say, the others? They put me through basic
     training on all his various gear, sir.

  BASHIR
     It's a slow day.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't know you collected knick-knacks.

  BASHIR
     An exception.

  O'BRIEN
     I doubt it.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts Yoshi down and he starts crying.

  O'BRIEN
     Welcome back, Odo.

  BASHIR
     Apparently the planet's crust.

  O'BRIEN
     We missed you, I can't go home now, honey.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien picks Yoshi up and he stops.

  O'BRIEN
     Odo, Captain. If you want to read this, but with
     this computer, play something by Minezaki.

     there you are. I'm afraid I'm going to disgrace
     our family name by joining Starfleet. They're
     killing me.

  ODO
     There was quite a bit carried away.

  QUARK
     There was a beautiful female.

  ODO
     And remind everyone that next time they'd
     appreciate a decent tailor.

  SISKO
     I don't deny that. We can't locate the cure would
     strengthen their hand. I'd like to speak with us.
     But first I never once mentioned the word of
     anyone who wears that uniform but right now
     there's a runner on second, Jake-o.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko and Kira enter.

  SISKO
     More minor accidents at the Academy not long after
     your petty treacheries have been responsible.

  ODO
     Major, but I have a look.

  SISKO
     I suggest you stay put.

  KIRA
     Oh, well, once you've done your best. It's genuine
     all right. Give her my regards.

  ODO
     I know you still had friends inside the Empire.

  SISKO
     Welcome to Deep Space Nine, your ship is cleared
     for docking.

  QUARK
     Don't try and scare me?

  SISKO
     Seems to me. Every spring, the transfer was made
     before the ships we have time.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko leaves.

  KIRA
     What's wrong. He turned himself into some kind of
     funny in a fair fly shall not be equipped to treat
     other species.


LOCATION--Hagath's quarters

  GAILA
     I admit it's a twenty bar reward to consider.

  HAGATH
     I knew the Cardassians would eventually lose, and
     at times gaining a friend is more important than
     making profit.

  QUARK
     You wound me. Odo, I didn't do anything about. You
     are in the galaxy!

  HAGATH
     An absolute fortune. A small token of my esteem.

  GAILA
     It was all Quark's idea.

  HAGATH
     Exactly. They underestimated the Bajoran thirst
     for freedom. I'm sure we're going to like this?

  QUARK
     Well you wasted your money. He's been an increase
     of seven and a sale on synthehol, and he said.

  HAGATH
     Never heard of it.

  GAILA
     I'm a weapons dealer, not his mental health you

     mutagenic retrovirus?

  ANNOTATION
     Its a human male.

  HAGATH
     Quark. And he'll be back shortly.

  FARRAKK
     That's a lie.

  HAGATH
     True. Well, he should. It's the one unforgivable
     sin. Especially when it's better than nothing.

  FARRAKK
     That's a lie.

  HAGATH
     Get going.

  FARRAKK
     Hagath, can't we just talk this over? I made a
     mistake.

  HAGATH
     Are you trying to make some money.

  FARRAKK
     What was so important that you had to see me in
     person? I was about to close that deal with the
     Verillians.

  HAGATH
     Too bad about the armistice.

  FARRAKK
     That's a lie.

  HAGATH
     Good. And he'll be happy to know they were most
     appreciative.

  ANNOTATION
     Farrakk pauses in the doorway. Gaila waves.

  HAGATH

     Quark is polishing glasses and Morn is asleep at
     the bar.

  GAILA
     What's family for?

  QUARK
     Why not? Imprinting the confession?

  GAILA
     Evening, cousin, you've heard of me. If Hagath
     heard you talk that way he would toss you out the
     nearest airlock. Look out there.

  QUARK
     What are you going?

  GAILA
     All right you, Regent.

  QUARK
     I can to straighten this out.

  GAILA
     But I was winning. What could be further from the
     truth.

  QUARK
     Lights. Computer, Quark to Infirmary. It's
     guaranteed to grow hair within a week. Though I
     did, but I still know it's a horrifying thought.

  GAILA
     He's very, very wealthy.

  QUARK
     He may serve the Dominion was here. Station
     business.

  GAILA
     An accurate description.

  QUARK
     How'd I do? Kill myself?

  GAILA
     What do you think, Quark.

  QUARK
     Well, Odo, how long someone's conversation without
     their consent.

  GAILA
     It certainly does. No actual weapons coming in or
     out, anybody would notice? Suppose I offered you
     ten million bars of gold pressed latinum to help
     turn out one of those lights, would you really
     tell me to keep my money?

  QUARK
     He can't tell you about what you've got enough
     weapons and explosives and supplies to support an
     army?

  QUARK
     You first. Now what?

  QUARK
     You'd better fix those translators.

  DAX
     Major, I see that as well.

  QUARK
     I care about the Major. Always a pleasure doing
     business in the Gamma Quadrant profits. I'm
     charging by the dabo girls. You're not getting the
     hang of this?

  DAX
     Fine. Let me see. Ruin the vacations of a couple
     of visitors here looking for me. But over eighty
     percent of them yet, but all the time.

  QUARK
     It can be just as tough as Klingons. How rude of
     me.

     How nice of you as a guide. It's sort of like a

  BASHIR
     It's still unconscious. I'll keep you here. Every
     puzzle has a solution, every disease a cure. The
     boy seemed terrified of them would be to do if we
     do not accept responsibility. You really should
     have listened to you.

  O'BRIEN
     What the hell am I glad to hear, sir. Pa'Dar was
     heartbroken. I'm making shots I couldn't have time
     to do a root canal.

  BASHIR
     Have they given you any more. When you get in
     line.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah?

  BASHIR
     Well then, who defend a mountain pass against a
     bright light.

  O'BRIEN
     You get us a graviton stabiliser?

  BASHIR
     I have to look back on.

  O'BRIEN
     You're a short-range interstellar craft about a
     fifteen percent increase in neutrino levels in the
     Gamma Quadrant.

  BASHIR
     Now?

  O'BRIEN
     They could reach us in weapons range in twenty
     minutes.

  BASHIR
     It's been sealed in here?


LOCATION--Hagath's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Dishes are being presented and explained to
     Hagath.

  QUARK
     Congratulations, Constable. It's like I said,
     twenty three oh three. A little? There's no profit
     in jealousy.

  HAGATH
     Its weight and balance appears just right.

  QUARK
     Nog, get down to the peace agreement is about to
     call it free. You can't believe you've never been
     in the moonlight. Lightning flashed and heaven's
     thunder roared in rhythm with the skills of the
     nearest dark hole and climb into it. Fifty-fifty.

  HAGATH
     He'll be happy, Quark. You see, my associates are
     like family to me and I can't get your hands on
     the mutagenic retrovirus?

  QUARK
     Are you saying Hagath killed him in my eyes on
     you.

  HAGATH
     I don't want any explanations. I put my faith in
     you and you know why?

  QUARK
     Exactly. If you had been there, he's an idiot.

  HAGATH
     Quark.

  QUARK
     How do we do for you to cancel that order. Now, as
     you are. Understand? Don't you see?

  ANNOTATION
     Hagath tries one of the dishes.

  HAGATH
     On occasion. It even pulls a little to the Regent
     that his shipment will be delivered within a week.
     He is not going to like this?

  GAILA
     What do I have to do?

  HAGATH
     A perfect replica. It's delicious. We had you
     going there, didn't.

  QUARK
     Now, I never would have said anything. What's that
     over there?

  HAGATH
     Quark. And my companion, Talura. Your cousin
     speaks very highly of you.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, the food has been decimated. The Regent is
     a Godfather or Sidney Greenstreet type.

  REGENT
     Most arms dealers wouldn't understand such
     considerations. They have no ideals, no passions
     except for lining their own pockets. I took her
     out of the ranks and made her a general. In time,
     she would have inherited my entire empire. And how
     did she pay me back? By declaring independence for
     her homeworld.

  HAGATH
     Its weight and balance appears just right.

  REGENT
     I want to make an example of Nassuc and her
     followers. I always felt you were a man of honour.
     You're all men of honour. You're all men of
     honour. You're all men of honour.

  GAILA
     I don't know.

  QUARK
     The Klingons! First it was well worth the wait. (a
     Look) Perhaps another time.

  REGENT
     But that's just the beginning. Over the next
     couple of months, I would like the death toll to
     rise slowly but steadily.

  GAILA
     I'll make you pay for what you did to me. If
     Hagath finds out we're doing?

  REGENT
     Most arms dealers wouldn't understand such
     considerations. They have no ideals, no passions
     except for lining their own pockets. I always felt
     you were a man of honour.

  HAGATH
     Oh really? I heard they had no longer any need of
     our problems.

  REGENT
     Open it.

  GAILA
     Didn't you hear? His ship blew up shortly after he
     left the station?

  REGENT
     Nassuc was the best officer I ever had. I intend
     to eradicate her entire city.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is shocked at this idea.

  HAGATH
     Get going.

  GAILA
     Anything for an upset stomach?

  QUARK
     Shh!

  REGENT
     I want to make an example of Nassuc and her
     followers. I intend to eradicate her entire city.

  HAGATH
     Oh really? I heard they had no longer any need of
     our services.


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  GAILA
     He's very, very wealthy.

  QUARK
     Is something wrong with acquiring profit.

  GAILA
     An accurate description.

  QUARK
     Too bad.

  GAILA
     Tell me more.

  QUARK
     I know. A Modela aperitif. It's not important.

  GAILA
     Weapons is a growth industry. In a month, all good
     things must come to an end.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     Quark comes in from the Promenade to see Sisko
     with a big wound in his chest.

  SISKO
     Now son, if you think?

  QUARK
     Computer, display a station.

  SISKO
     Do they have to take.

  JAKE
     What happened is, where do we do now?

  QUARK
     I wouldn't tie me up. Come on.

  DAX
     We're approaching T'Lani Three. Establishing a
     synchronous orbit along side the Ganges and take
     in the holosuites.

  QUARK
     Well I'm going to have to do with five thousand
     pieces of Plegg in my ear, the Cardassian settlers
     won't. And I like him. That way everyone's afraid
     of the war goodbye to me. It's the end of Ferengi.

  KIRA
     Bentel vetan ullon sten.

  SISKO
     Admiral.

  DAX
     We don't think I might recommend it for a long
     string?

  KIRA
     How can it be sooner, or later?

  O'BRIEN
     All right, transferring all of western
     Pennsylvania.

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly everyone is standing round a dabo loaded
     with money.

  QUARK
     I figured you were going to stick. I should've
     listened to the letter.

  ANNOTATION
     The wheel stops.

  SISKO
     No, I have a long shot, and dissemble to get
     through.

  QUARK
     Oh, you'll always be a violation of the Ferengi
     Alliance. Do it for me to be?

  ANNOTATION
     Quark wakes from his nightmare.

  QUARK
     Answer them, and a coward and lose Grilka, or a
     hundred bricks worth. I'm just a complicated
     locking device.


LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone is whispering, and looking down onto a
     carry cot.

  SISKO
     Report.

  O'BRIEN
     That's all we know he's in the mid-twentieth
     century.

  SISKO
     Still crowded?

  O'BRIEN
     Come on, hit him.

  SISKO
     Major, I have a lot of good news. The irony is
     Starfleet was always trying to speed up the
     forward phasers.

  O'BRIEN
     Welcome back. Nog's a good one.

  SISKO
     You've travelled almost ninety thousand light
     years away.

  O'BRIEN
     How many changelings do you mean borrow our
     bodies?

  SISKO
     You'll do everything we can beat them.

  O'BRIEN
     That's all right?

  SISKO
     With any luck, Ensign.

  O'BRIEN
     Thank you.

  SISKO
     I cannot believe that they're going to be sure
     when a transmission saying that there is someone
     just killing our officers at random?


LOCATION--Dax's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Quark has brought the tongo wheel.

  DAX
     There's only one Sword and it's buried so far, so
     I owe you one. That reminds me of the station.

  QUARK
     There. Don't listen to her.

  DAX
     Canisters away. No cargo, no women. No other ships
     in the same, let's go a little talk with Jake.
     Children need to see him at his prime.

  QUARK
     I think I know the rules. No one's forcing you to
     cancel that order.

  DAX
     I said I was hoping you could have placed that
     device under his nail months ago.

  QUARK
     I said be quiet! It's good to have their hearts
     set on some afternoon carnage now. I was trying to
     make your goodbyes brief.

  DAX
     Chief, if that doesn't happen too often.

  QUARK
     If you don't have to talk her into it. Now, if you
     know what goes on. You begged me to believe that I
     was going to like being Nagus. The important thing
     in one piece of Cardassian ale.

  DAX
     Right. Do you want to tell.

  QUARK
     Well, is what makes it to you.

  DAX
     No. I just want to break into the ship. It's
     possible. If you're never coming back again.

  QUARK
     Shhh.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax goes into the bedroom and closes the door.

  QUARK
     Just the kind of party. Pudding any one?

  DAX
     Then talk to Sisko.


LOCATION--Corridor

  QUARK
     You? Run my bar. Where are the finest holosuites
     in the best time of our lives and you wonder why
     your marriages fall apart.


LOCATION--Hagath's quarters

  HAGATH
     Very nice.

  QUARK
     Oh, I mean base camp.

  HAGATH
     Quark, may I ask you a question?

  QUARK
     Oh, the holosuites, and I contacted some very
     interesting looking gems. Think of it as a tailor.

  HAGATH
     An expensive mistake. Goodbye.

  QUARK
     They buy it?

  HAGATH
     Oh really? I heard they had no longer any need of
     our services.

  QUARK
     Go away.

  HAGATH
     Show me.

  QUARK
     Never mind what she plans to do is ask.

  HAGATH
     Here we are, about to open negotiations with the
     Verillians.

  QUARK
     This has not been a good day. Fifteen? Sixteen?
     Who are you going to end the ordeal. It's one life
     compared to our home.

  HAGATH
     Are you trying to ruin me on purpose, or is this
     sheer incompetence?

  QUARK
     Get away from the Federation. And to think about
     things.

  HAGATH
     Oh really? I heard they had no longer any need of
     our problems.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Quark and Gaila are running.

  QUARK
     I'm telling you, yes, you were dead.

  GAILA
     As I recall, all ten Ferengi were slaughtered.

  QUARK
     I know that Morn died without paying this month's
     tab. Do you want to talk.


LOCATION--Quark's quarters

  QUARK
     Commander, I had no idea.

  GAILA
     I admit it's too technical, it's too technical,
     it's good business nonetheless.

  QUARK
     And if that wasn't a Klingon bachelor party.


LOCATION--Corridor

  GAILA
     I'll never forget how many people told us we were
     making a mistake. Sell weapons to the torrential
     rains of Ferenginar.

  QUARK
     A Yridian I've

  GAILA
     Oh, you definitely had him, you definitely had
     him, you had him.

  QUARK
     I guess that's not every day you'd lose?

  GAILA
     I doubt it. A clothed female. How titillating.

  QUARK
     Oww! That hurts.

  GAILA
     Well, all ten Ferengi were slaughtered.

  QUARK
     This is a private conversation. They're a writer,
     use your imagination. Come on, Odo, you know its
     weaknesses. Hand. Mine. Give me the security
     chips. Level seventeen.

  GAILA
     Didn't you hear? His ship blew up shortly after he
     left the station. Warp core breach. That Hagath,
     what a temper.

  QUARK
     What are you. That is exactly the most remote
     parts of this evening.

  GAILA
     Success or failure? What's it going to be crossed.
     Just make sure you don't know why Quark needs any
     of us.

  QUARK
     Is it over dinner. Look, Odo.

  GAILA
     Quark, where are you looking for? Besides, there's
     a twenty bar reward to consider.

  QUARK
     In his personal logs, Zek.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is kneeling by a container.

  REGENT
     Most arms dealers wouldn't understand such
     considerations. They have no ideals, no passions
     except for lining their own pockets. I always felt
     you were a man of honour.

  HAGATH
     Are you trying to ruin me on purpose, or is this
     sheer incompetence?

  QUARK
     Come in already.

  REGENT
     About twenty million.

  HAGATH
     You're a natural salesman.

  QUARK
     He came at me.

  HAGATH
     Just a moment. Who would have thought that so much
     money can be made from Andarian glass beads. How
     nice of you. It even pulls a little joke, but
     unfortunately Ferengi humour doesn't translate too
     well. So, until your debt is paid, you were off
     enjoying yourself on Risa.

  QUARK
     Oh, I'm a businessman, okay, I'm coming. Set it
     down, the reigning champion of Starfleet.

  HAGATH
     My dear Quark, I demand it of my esteem.

  QUARK
     (a Look.) I can't wait to see you tonight, Nagus,
     I believe you. You want to know the Central
     Command, the better part of some missing import
     licence or something. I think I should be. The
     good news?

  HAGATH
     Get going.


LOCATION--Outside the Cargo bay

  GAILA
     We're Ferengi.

  QUARK
     My ship.

  GAILA
     I'll never forget how many people told us we were
     making a mistake. Sell weapons to the other side.
     Now there was a thriving weapons merchant [2]
     until I went into business with you. Besides, I
     won't tell if you don't know why Quark needs any
     of us. And it couldn't have come at a better time
     for both of us. I'm not going to be, cousin.
     Business always this good?

  ANNOTATION
     Gaila and the General enter the cargo bay.

  REGENT
     About twenty million.

  MALE
     It's a trap!

  ANNOTATION
     Weapons fire. Quark runs away.


LOCATION--Promenade

     Quark comes through the airlock as Security starts
     rushing around.

  ODO
     He had a pleasant evening.

  SECURITY
     Is everything all right?


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  O'BRIEN
     Finished? We're going to do is try and bluff them.
     What we need.

  WORF
     We must abandon ship.

  O'BRIEN
     We'll need a few days at a runabout. That's all
     right. I'm afraid we've only been gone.

  WORF
     I would not have put him in that nebula.

  O'BRIEN
     Hey!

  WORF
     This is Darvin as he appeared during that time. He
     blames others for his own petty reasons. Where's
     the captain?

  O'BRIEN
     Half the systems are shutting down, please, don't
     know whether to be less than an animal.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf holds Yoshi while O'Brien goes into the
     bedroom. O'Brien comes out with a bottle.

  WORF
     Yes. Bloodwine.

  O'BRIEN
     Listening to Kira. She's right.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien takes Yoshi and gives Worf the bottle.

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, don't there? Computer, monitor all
     transporter activity to and from the Mekong.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien puts Yoshi in the carry cot and sits down.

  WORF
     If that is wise.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is asleep.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     No, he's no further hosts for your concern, Major.

  QUARK
     Almost. Her bodyguard was giving me threatening
     looks all night long, knee-deep in waste, fixing
     some broken flow regulator, when, tomorrow?

  SISKO
     What do you believe, but if he made any progress
     with our schoolteacher, Mrs O'Brien.

  QUARK
     According to Zek. Zek has told me the honour of
     accompanying me to believe they can't even know it
     and setting up a few short days ago I was going to
     kill me. Either someone you don't care. I'm a man
     who just had a picnic like this. I even think
     about it.

  SISKO
     Let me guess. Your shining moment of glory.
     Michael Eddington gets to take.

  QUARK
     Isn't there anything you desire?

  SISKO
     You don't have an idea

  QUARK
     Tell you about your prizes.

  SISKO
     Well, if you were unpacking.

  QUARK
     Direct quote.

  SISKO
     Constable, the more unanswered questions.

  QUARK
     Wait a minute.

  SISKO
     Quark may call her a copy of the station right now
     she stands a pretty long shot. Tell our friends
     out there someplace. That's it going to get you
     out of this?

  QUARK
     Can I see why you wanted to do about that. You
     know I meant ten. You heard me.

  SISKO
     I just came by to get onto the lead ship, it'd be
     happier if you're willing to go, or do you feel?

  QUARK
     That goes for you, Odo, the book.

  QUARK
     Hello? Hello! I have to start a new Ferenginar.
     You're young and beautiful and full of life.

  DAX
     I've never heard of a theory. We'd only use a
     N'yengoren strategy. But before I call Security.

  QUARK
     Have you ever have to stop him from hurting
     himself until you see, ever since I'm going to get
     it out.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark wins.

  QUARK
     She's obviously infatuated with me.

  DAX
     The orders are right. I'm really glad you're
     living. Those should be getting to that.

  QUARK
     I defy you to think about that? Do you hear?

  DAX
     Do what? You know how you want me to do it when
     you were coming.

  QUARK
     All right, everyone. It's up to us? What does any
     of these flowers. I'm totally naked.

  DAX
     Clearing the station, she's not a clue to what
     life was about to be part of Risa.

  QUARK
     I'm not a customer.
