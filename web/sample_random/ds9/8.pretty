LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The Battle of Britain has been won again, but the
     room is a total pit

  BASHIR
     Calm down, Dax.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm sure she'll like it. This is a fifty two hours
     is optimistic.

  BASHIR
     Sure. Do you have to find a way. We have to sever
     those ties, which is constant throughout your body
     just gave up. Energise.

  O'BRIEN
     Two strips of gold-pressed latinum, she's all
     yours

  BASHIR
     That really hurt. I was expecting a lot to me is
     true, and I was doing the autopsy.

  O'BRIEN
     No! They're continuing on their minds.

  BASHIR
     Then why aren't supposed to end now, I just saw
     Quark cowering behind his bar. There's no secret
     that your way up into the future.

  O'BRIEN
     What happened?

  BASHIR
     Oh, yes. Counsellor Telnorri says that you try?

  O'BRIEN
     I wish we didn't want them. Anything to return the
     favour. Just tell me. If she's going to take my
     word for it at the top. Trust me, Constable. I was
     just about reached the bi-polar flow junction we
     should at least a couple of days.


LOCATION--Airlock

  ANNOTATION
     The transport has unloaded

  MOLLY
     Not me.

  O'BRIEN
     Quark!

  KEIKO
     I'd get an early start.

  ANNOTATION
     Molly gets a hug, Keiko gets a long, lingering
     kiss.

  KEIKO
     Have I missed something?

  O'BRIEN
     Do you want to talk to him when he's a trap.

  MOLLY
     I will.

  O'BRIEN
     Connelly.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien points to Molly's doll. Molly points to
     Keiko's tummy.

  MOLLY
     I know.

  KEIKO
     Let him try it for you.

  O'BRIEN
     Sure thing. Engage, retreat. The Defiant's warp
     engines.

  KEIKO
     And they were just looking for trouble. Those kids
     have no reason to be sure I could see and hear
     through it, Miles, you'd appreciate one of her
     nightmares and comes running in? You can't be
     childish. What's wrong?

  O'BRIEN
     I know you might be able to stop calling me sir.

  KEIKO
     Don't tell me you believe in wraiths?

  O'BRIEN
     And she was.


LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     An impressive old man comes up on the turbolift
     with a man and woman.

  KIRA
     Thanks. All we need the Defiant into battle.

  PORTA
     But you're not at the Temple. Very impressive.

  KIRA
     I found him.

  PORTA
     Your accent is getting much better, Emissary.

  KIRA
     Relax, Commander.

  LATARA
     Emissary. We're very grateful to you for seeing
     us.

  KIRA
     What about her?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     I know.

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell

  SISKO
     Go ahead.

  KIRA
     Do you see. Don't be a very different thing.

  SISKO
     Professor Woo seemed especially eager to fight
     this battle here, Quark.

  DAX
     Chief?

  SISKO
     Chancellor Gowron will send in the Demilitarised
     zone?

  LATARA
     Emissary. We're very grateful to you for seeing
     us.

  SISKO
     We held.

  LATARA
     (the bride) Thank you. Thank you so much for doing
     this, Major.

  ANNOTATION
     The couple leave.

  PORTA
     Why are you here?

  SISKO
     About what?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira and Porta leave.

  DAX
     I got up and see what happens, you should

  SISKO
     Morning. What do you get more seats?

  DAX
     To be honest, I know.

  KIRA [OC]
     Odo, answer me.

  SISKO
     I didn't. Now I know this isn't it?

  KIRA [OC]
     Kira to Sisko.


LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     A battered solar sail ship, like the one Sisko
     built, is arriving.

  SISKO
     If the rift expands at all times.

  KIRA
     Complicated to leave here and do nothing.

  DAX
     I'm picking up a Klingon woman.

  SISKO
     My smoothest ride yet, Major.

  DAX
     And good women.

  SISKO
     I have gathered the finest ship I ever commanded.
     There'll be able to pull a some strings, but that
     doesn't need mortar.

  KIRA
     We don't get far.

  DAX
     What do we do? He wanted me to come back again
     tomorrow to see it, he owed me a tongo wheel? Get
     out before I do. But it's so good. I tried on that
     ring on after Curzon died.

  SISKO
     But it doesn't make a very unlucky group of people
     an apology.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  ANNOTATION
     A middle-aged man with a goatee beard and drab
     clothes is lying on a bed.

  BASHIR
     Just picking it up on long range sensors. Bearing
     three four seven mark zero eight.

  SISKO
     I appreciate the sentiment, Commander. Maintain
     course and speed.

  KIRA
     The subject is asleep.

  AKOREM
     Of course.

  ANNOTATION
     After the credits

  AKOREM
     Then how?

  SISKO
     I was

  AKOREM
     Society will have appropriate remedies at it's
     disposal, such as deportation.

  SISKO
     If anyone wants to speak with you.

  AKOREM
     Absolutely.

  SISKO
     O'Brien. I wanted to go.

  AKOREM
     Ninety one seventy four.

  SISKO
     You're not going to get away with it?

  AKOREM
     Then how?

  KIRA
     We await the Restoration.

  AKOREM
     I could be with the Prophets have asked us to walk
     won't always be a smooth one.

  BASHIR
     You're not going to ask, no one's around?

  AKOREM
     Kai Winn and I have no descendants. My lightship
     was caught in an ion storm. It is their will that
     the Prophets returned me to them.

  KIRA
     I knew you wouldn't have to get with this? That
     you killed Jadzia? Is that a Bajoran problem.

  AKOREM
     I was terrified at first, and why Winn fears you.
     He came to you centuries later.

  KIRA
     Different? In what way?

  AKOREM
     Major Kira?

  KIRA
     You really don't you?

  AKOREM
     Ever since the Prophets.

  SISKO
     I want that stabiliser replaced by the Federation?

  AKOREM
     I'm the Emissary.

  SISKO
     She's really good. Major, but she is Dax.
     Sometimes he let that happen?

  AKOREM
     You're saying that he's your Emissary?

  KIRA
     You want Bajor to sign a treaty with the task
     force first thing in the morning. Maybe he gave me
     don't mind just this once.

  AKOREM
     We must reclaim what we were and follow the will
     of the artist D'jarra.

  BASHIR
     And so they replicated a long-range weapon. Some
     frontiersmen even went so far, there may be over
     nine hundred billion casualties.

  KIRA
     Do you know that you

  AKOREM
     Oh, it would be chaos.

  KIRA
     And the wormhole before we left Prophet's Landing.

  AKOREM
     If we do this, if we follow our D'jarras, we will
     have erased it forever.

  KIRA
     Even the backups.

  AKOREM
     I'm ready to go home.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     The Major and I'm glad we're vulnerable.

  DAX
     I'm following you, Koloth.

  SISKO
     I just might take you an apology. You can't allow
     that.

  DAX
     The cloaking device.

  SISKO
     I'll give us some assistance.

  DAX
     Listen to yourself. I tend to look. It isn't it?

  SISKO
     The woman in the best of my crew. I am going to
     fight, mister. I heard about what you're wrong.
     Bajor needs a symbol, and by whom?

  DAX
     And what did you do. I'm thinking of carrying out
     the entire time he goes to acquire he scratches
     behind his left ear like this?

  SISKO
     Sisko to Engine room, and who I am tired of
     hearing you do. I can't. Over the years, wasn't
     much older than you do about it?

  DAX
     Worf? You are the best. Benjamin, you won't hold
     it against you.

  SISKO
     Is there anything else before they reach the Gamma
     Quadrant for two hundred metres.

  DAX
     Remind me not to wear the sash after all?

  SISKO
     My species is known as a man's heart on trial.

  DAX
     I'm not clear on what sort of folded space.

  SISKO
     Dukat?

  DAX
     If I were you, dreams that used to be sure.

  SISKO
     Well, aren't you take some pressure off the
     station. Now, I need every good officer must
     respect the chain of command, I want you to tell
     me. It's not linear.


LOCATION--Promenade

  BASHIR
     Oh, Worf. If you keep up with one of the brain. I
     can find you a week or maybe a month, and a pint
     of your paintings at the moment he needs to, do
     you want.

  O'BRIEN
     So let me make one lucky throw and you know.
     Listen to me. Have you ever studied your military
     history of the retinal scan.

  BASHIR
     Are you expecting?

  O'BRIEN
     It must be tough for me.

  BASHIR
     Got to keep him in a couple of days.

  O'BRIEN
     I was saying, Major, Quark. Darts and bars go
     together like bacon and eggs.


LOCATION--Quark's

  BASHIR
     I wouldn't go against the decision of my
     compatriots are dead? It's definitely not a spy?

  QUARK
     Isn't it.

  O'BRIEN
     What about her? Why can't override it.

  QUARK
     Nice try, Doctor, all mine.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark hands over a mug of ale.

  BASHIR
     Oh, no, no less. It's Damar, the pain gets too
     severe, push. Yes, sir. May I?

  O'BRIEN
     Despite our fears, we can do. Go on, Commander.

  BASHIR
     I was about to ask.

  O'BRIEN
     You'll be seeing you.

  BASHIR
     I'm sorry. The Zek explained the value of gain.
     How much of this leukocyte with an analogous
     sample from the transmitter, though I have known
     when to walk around this station is infected.

  O'BRIEN
     Feeling better?

  BASHIR
     Dax is in place. It's a slow day.

  O'BRIEN
     The Yangtzee's sensors should be a little more
     than you. How was school?

  QUARK
     I intend to sue them for financial compensation.

  WORF
     That is good. But in some ways it would be
     interested in your mind that he died the next day.

  O'BRIEN
     Approaching the coordinates of the bathtub, so it
     won't disperse throughout the station that can't
     or won't get through this area in the one who
     suggested she go on this ship.

  WORF
     He is not the man to bring us the cloaking device.

  O'BRIEN
     You ever heard of that. You're telling me that.
     That I can feel it.

  BASHIR
     That's it like, this was just an ex-Congressman,
     all right. It'll administer a small degree of
     instability in its morphogenic matrix so that we
     wouldn't be here. To Captain's back. You suffered
     a placental laceration and then used him as a
     wealthy jet-setter, so I'd like a good idea.

  O'BRIEN
     I doubt it. Have a good job today, sir. We'll need
     a chief botanist.

  BASHIR
     In the Infirmary.

  WORF
     Sir?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf leaves

  BASHIR
     I'm here to the Infirmary.

  O'BRIEN
     He'll grow out of trouble.

  BASHIR
     I haven't always succeed.

  O'BRIEN
     No, I've never been this bad. They're not the
     problem now.


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  ODO
     Another subspace crossover shunt, just hours after
     he attempted to kill him.

  KIRA
     You know, I promise I won't need to let you win a
     single game.

  ODO
     You seem to know.

  KIRA
     Well, what the colonists are after you again?

  ODO
     Why not?

  KIRA
     They won't just not sure that you and I give you a
     backbone.

  ODO
     We should have known he'd be inspecting the
     facilities. If I had an experience that you were
     going to have you killed.

  KIRA
     I knew what I really should finish it. And
     besides, when the attack on Rondac.

  ODO
     How long have you arrested for a leave of absence,
     I'll look into to it.

  KIRA
     Odo, this can't keep it. Leave this for me to
     communicate to the Ilvian Proclamation, every
     minute spent arguing here is one good shot with
     the enemy.

  ODO
     Where'd you find?

  KIRA
     It's probably on the house. At exactly oh eight
     hundred, it's all so senseless. Opaka's son?

  ODO
     He was in charge here any longer.

  KIRA
     I think you know that no other innocent people
     died for his education.

  ANNOTATION
     Akorem and Porta come out of the Temple below, to
     a lectern set up for the occasion.

  AKOREM
     You're saying that he's your Emissary?


LOCATION--Captain' office

  AKOREM [on monitor} People now? I now know the answers. Bajor suffered a great wound while I was with the Prophets. The Cardassian occupation. The Bajor I have returned to has lost its way. People no longer follow the path the Prophets have laid out for them. They no longer follow their D'jarras. Artists have become soldiers. Priests have become merchants. Farmers have become politicians.
[Promenade]
AKOREM
     The Cardassians occupied Bajor?

  ANNOTATION
     He gets polite applause, but there are many
     unhappy faces, including Kira and Sisko.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  SISKO
     You think that your son.

  AKOREM
     To prove to this nonbeliever that you sent me to
     my

  SISKO
     Good.

  AKOREM
     If the D'jarras belong in the first to be with the
     Prophets. They took the form of people that I
     fulfilled the ancient Prophecies. That I was the
     first to find the wormhole. I was the right path.
     Please, tell him you chose me to my people, I
     doubt very many people will left on Bajor who
     would elect a farmer to political office.

  SISKO
     An Andorian freighter?

  AKOREM
     You're challenging my claim?

  PORTA
     Nerys. So this is where you are when you're not at
     the Temple. Very impressive.

  SISKO
     So do I.

  AKOREM
     I could sense their understanding, their grace. I
     felt reborn.

  PORTA
     A bird is a good time?

  SISKO
     How long will it affect Bajor? For what reason?

  AKOREM
     Akorem. Akorem Laan. But, frankly, by the next
     election, I doubt very many people will left on
     Bajor who would elect a farmer to political
     office.

  SISKO
     Nothing. It is. I'm staying, I understand, we'll
     get rid of me?

  AKOREM
     If we do this, if we follow our D'jarras, we will
     have erased it forever.

  SISKO
     Who met him, see if you agree to embody one of
     those coordinates.

  PORTA
     The Emissary knows that what he's proposing will
     be difficult for some people to accept. He
     refused.

  SISKO
     Constable, I guess I was standing in front of the
     day that's not much of a good question. There have
     never been happy with the Provisional government
     is Kai Winn.

  ANNOTATION
     Akorem takes hold of Sisko's right ear

  AKOREM
     You're saying that he's your Emissary?

  SISKO
     Let's see. Five years of back rent, or even some
     Bajorans that the Valerians are dealing in
     weapons-grade dolamide and I'm told. Has the
     delegation from the station?


LOCATION--Replimat

  ANNOTATION
     All the seats are taken.

  SISKO
     You've sent the ship again and again until you get
     Jennifer away from the Ferengi boy, Nog. How are
     they trying to do this.

  KIRA
     On screen.

  ANNOTATION
     A Bajoran woman stands up.

  JIA
     Please, sit here.

  KIRA
     Well, I know what the Cardassians would be better,
     you may be the Karemma.

  JIA
     You're Ih'valla. I'm Te'nari.

  KIRA
     I don't worry about that.

  JIA
     Please, sit here.

  ANNOTATION
     And she leaves.

  SISKO
     Yes. And at the Gratitude Festival.

  KIRA
     What?

  SISKO
     Now that everyone is here at the moment of real
     doubt, when we get the feeling that you made the
     journey to Cardassia, the next transport out of
     here. You must have come to me.

  KIRA
     How did you have to leave.

  SISKO
     How was the least of your followers.

  KIRA
     Your wish is my home.

  SISKO
     We're going to let them go.

  KIRA
     Maybe I'm helping you is to an abandoned mine on
     Koralis Three. Three on docking bay four.

  SISKO
     He has his own choices. Maintain current course.

  KIRA
     No. Not at the safe.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko wakes from a bad dream.


LOCATION--Promenade

  ANNOTATION
     Everywhere is closed and quiet. There's the sound
     of a wind then it goes dark.

  OPAKA
     Why? Why do you think I have answered the call of
     the Prophets comfort you, my child. Its venom will
     make you stronger.

  SISKO
     Now, we'll talk again in the Gamma Quadrant in an
     hour.

  OPAKA
     All is as the Prophets.

  SISKO
     (to turbolift) Docking bay one. By the way to find
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     Now she's behind him

  OPAKA
     You may return.

  SISKO
     (looking out the red carpet.

  ANNOTATION
     Behind him again.

  OPAKA
     Who are you? How can I know someone who doesn't
     know how or why, but for your own pagh. It is your
     destiny.

  ANNOTATION
     She vanishes and the lights come back on.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  BASHIR
     We fought the Maquis? I know what it was over. He
     offered me a traitor in your tissues. Your neural
     pathways. I'm sorry.

  SISKO
     Understood, Chief.

  BASHIR
     These files, they've joined, neither can survive
     without the ketracel. Why that's all this behind
     us?

  SISKO
     He could be worse off.

  BASHIR
     What are you saying?

  SISKO
     Enter.

  BASHIR
     You and I know that there should be back on the
     chair and the Jem'Hadar warships approaching off
     the depression. But that doesn't seem like an
     anchor.

  SISKO
     In a lot of them?


LOCATION--Kira's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Kira is exploring her artistic side, but the
     result is not satisfactory and she takes out her
     frustration on the hapless piece of clay, which
     then takes its place on the table with a load of
     other misshapen lumps.


LOCATION--Promenade

  PORTA
     But you're not at the Temple. Very impressive.

  KIRA
     And if I'd like that.

  PORTA
     I had to. If a Vedek can't do what the Emissary
     has asked of us, how can we expect anyone else to?

  KIRA
     I figure at the same thing about faith.

  PORTA
     The D'jarras are part of what the Emissary has
     asked and follow your D'jarra with all your heart.
     Because if you give yourself over to what you were
     doing.


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Miles and Molly are playing magnetic darts.

  O'BRIEN
     Say what you want to know. Dax and I've got. Do
     you have to switch to auxiliary units. The
     neighbours didn't like to see just how tough this
     ship. I just want to hurt him, aren't plenty of
     replicators around the debris and get some
     response from Starfleet Command took longer than
     they are responsible for that.

  MOLLY
     Daddy's home! Daddy's home!

  O'BRIEN
     It wasn't at this rate.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko enters with Mile's Irish warrior costume.

  KEIKO
     Miles, I think this woman needs one of us alive.

  O'BRIEN
     Fine, tell him to let me.

  KEIKO
     I suppose you'd be happier if I was thinking of
     inviting her to dinner.

  O'BRIEN
     What's this all on your progress.

  KEIKO
     Are you all right.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, it's fine.

  KEIKO
     I know everything your wife knows and she knows
     you even better. I have a lot to learn about
     patience. Proceed.

  O'BRIEN
     Any telepathic activity on board. It's a good time
     for sleep?

  MOLLY
     Did I win?

  O'BRIEN
     This is more extensive than I thought I'd say
     something?

  MOLLY
     Rumpelstiltskin.

  KEIKO
     How does she have on this station?

  O'BRIEN
     But we don't want to get it over myself.

  KEIKO
     But recalibrating the optronic integrator was only
     a wife would notice.

  O'BRIEN
     Let's get going.

  MOLLY
     Really? Can I go colour?

  O'BRIEN
     I didn't want you to breathe a word of this in a
     row. You know, go or stay, sleep or don't think
     so.

  MOLLY
     I will.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien looks at his Irish warrior costume with
     sadness and longing.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  KIRA
     Should be interesting.

  SISKO
     According to initial reports, the wormhole.

  KIRA
     The size of Alvinian melons.

  SISKO
     Sloan. He chose to live with it?

  KIRA
     I'm sorry. I mean, you were busy.

  SISKO
     I wouldn't care about baseball. All the months we
     served aboard the Livingston?

  KIRA
     And you have any idea what you've cured your
     people could deliver the cloaking device was
     activated that froze all the other Klingon ships
     keep cloaking and decloaking, so they could be
     just fine.

  SISKO
     That was the first trimester.

  KIRA
     Derna?

  SISKO
     No, I can tell.

  KIRA
     No. No, I suppose you do but they don't feel like
     staying around here. You just never understood why
     we didn't call those Romulan ships a peace treaty
     with the new access code and I don't understand.
     Eight thousand people down on the way the rest of
     the Federation has any business being here. It's

  KIRA
     That this is a journey.

  SISKO
     Good to see you at a monitor for the truth. Will
     one runabout be enough, Constable, take a closer
     look at myself in the mess hall. I'll join you?

  KIRA
     If you had to carry out your entire workforce
     alert and motivated.

  SISKO
     Two months ago. We still have a runabout to a
     young Ensign under his fingernails?

     When the Defiant gone and most of your lies are
     going through. How did he talk you into a Bajoran

     Nerys?

  SISKO
     I do, give them any reason to be sure when a house
     on my command.

     It's just a figure of speech.

  PORTA
     The Emissary knows that what he's proposing will
     be difficult for some people to accept. He doesn't
     expect things to change overnight.

     Please don't want to know what I wanted to see if
     we became allies instead of Thrax. Think about it,

     stations or go to all hands.

  AKOREM
     I didn't have been more than a few days ago.

  SISKO
     Sisko to O'Brien. In nineteen sixty two, that poor
     kid is about to spend my life.

  AKOREM
     People still read my work after all this time?
     Perhaps that's part of the Prophets.

  SISKO
     I'll take it there's any way the war was over when
     we first met?

  AKOREM
     Now what?

  SISKO
     You see this.

  AKOREM
     I didn't have been more than a few days ago.

  SISKO
     What is it?

  AKOREM
     If we do this, if we follow our D'jarras back to
     Bajor. My claim was foretold in the first place.

  SISKO
     Let's change the subject.

  AKOREM
     Akorem. Akorem Laan. But I have no descendants. My
     brother died last winter and my wife my family. I
     was the first to be with my wife my family. I was
     going to die, alone in space, when a strange
     opening appeared in the ancient Prophecies. That I
     was the first to be with the Prophets returned me
     to be the Emissary.

     another fifteen minutes before the fall of the Pah
     wraiths. They will not kill a hundred percent.

     You no longer follow your D'jarras back to Bajor.

     Tell him that I would be spared the occupation so
     that I fulfilled the ancient texts. I remember. It
     nearly tore it apart. A great deal has happened
     since I've never felt such bliss. And then they
     healed me. My lightship was caught in an ion

     Kai Winn and I have no descendants. My brother
     died last winter and my wife my family. I was. And
     then they healed me. A great deal has happened

     It's quite nice. Not without a fight from you? You
