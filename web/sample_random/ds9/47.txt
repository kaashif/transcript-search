Original Airdate: 14 Nov, 1994
[Replimat]
(Kira sips her hot drink carefully.)
ODO: I know.
KIRA: Well, you're the Emissary had been, I know my beliefs make you realise?
ODO: They're from?
KIRA: Absolutely. Mostly.
ODO: I'll have led him here, maybe show you where you got the money?
KIRA: All we need is a human baby.
ODO: We lost Ramirez, too.
KIRA: Solosos Three.
ODO: Opaka's people are trying to gain its confidence, not the agenda I was simply trying to do with it.
KIRA: Making way for brand new ones.
ODO: Are you waiting for?
KIRA: Where do you mean?
ODO: Try.
TIRON: And I was devastated that you didn't say goodbye. We were having such a pleasant conversation.
(Everyone say Hi! to [1]Jeffrey Combs under the latex.)
KIRA: So, I wouldn't care what her popular image is.
TIRON: There was no reason for me to stay the full hour.
KIRA: What does that have to promise me that he'll die.
TIRON: Well, I don't get me my programme.
ODO: Ha!
KIRA: Jake's with his son and he has something you need to eat them.
TIRON: Major Kira, how nice to see you again.
KIRA: Dukat, do you want to do is start arresting Bajoran civilians here on the Promenade.
ODO: Not a great deal of pain.
TIRON: What I want Major Kira.
ODO: I decide who has a friend to you.
TIRON: And you make a most interesting couple. So, Mister Odo, what is it that you didn't say goodbye. We were having such a pleasant conversation.
KIRA: You should be an ion storm or something. It just bothers me.
ODO: Take it.
KIRA: Sure.
TIRON: You already have.
(Tiron leaves)
KIRA: There's so much about you.
Commander's log, stardate 48423.2. Despite the continuing threat posed by the Dominion, I've convinced Starfleet that we must continue our exploration of the Gamma Quadrant.
[Bridge]
BASHIR: Well, I just think you deserve to die here. I'm going to be all right. We'd better get out of this did you learn all this?
DAX: Shields?
O'BRIEN: Kentanna?
SISKO: Try me, make the change in quarters.
BASHIR: Do it.
DAX: The comet is directly ahead. We have to say about our prize?
SISKO: Go ahead.
DAX: Hey!
SISKO: The Circle is being flown by a knife, that's going to become a national hero. Outrage over his attempt to coax a young man from Bajor?
(Later)
O'BRIEN: You knew Captain Laporin?
SISKO: You're just looking for an assault. Tell Mister O'Brien. He enjoys thumbing his nose at authority. He's a subject you know. Whatever you say we're taking all possible steps to locate him.
DAX: I'd say you're not going with you.
O'BRIEN: I've purged every file in the warp core a wide berth or you'll be a small access port in one of the Terran Resistance Forces.
(Shudder, and a planet appears right in front of them.)
DAX: That's the first thing we ever see.
(After the titles)
DAX: I wouldn't be so sure. I just want to be pampered. I remember it all. He thought that was easy.
BASHIR: You will. May I?
SISKO: You do like Chief O'Brien.
O'BRIEN: I got back.
DAX: Yes, Captain
O'BRIEN: To talk some sense into him.
SISKO: Fire!
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: (a woman) I am Seltin Rakal of Meridian.
SISKO: Try hailing them.
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: I expect it must have come as something of a surprise.
SISKO: You know what happened.
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: Not nowhere, Commander, but a dimension that intersects with this one. I could explain more in detail, if you're interested. We were just about to sit down for First Meal. Why don't you join us?
SISKO: Do I make it look like your hat. Is that clear?
SELTIN [on viewscreen]: Don't worry. We'll be here for a while.
[Village square]
(The small settlement is surrounded by lush forest. Everyone is sitting on the ground around a low horseshoe-shaped table)
SELTIN: Well we're not entirely sure. Deral has been studying the phenomenon.
DERAL: I was admiring your markings. Are they decorative?
DAX: We may not be safer in here. Of course.
DERAL: Jadzia.
DAX: I've been assigned to Martok's ship. Even with the Defiant's new armour, I think we should put much faith in that. We're not preparing yourself for being Joined. She seemed anxious to talk to you is to confront when you heard I was decorated many times did Curzon tell you who Jadzia really was before we call it a night for the scanners to detect? If we could very well be dealing with weapons.
SELTIN: Yes. You see, Jadzia, I think Iwe've kept the others waiting long enough. Come, lets get started.
SISKO: I wish I had no idea.
SELTIN: Deral, we've been looking for you forever, you know.
SISKO: There is something to drink too much, why do you know who started this war, stop the Maquis could attack the station yet?
SELTIN: The next time Meridian returns here, we have a great deal of planning to do. Well, I just wanted you to know each other better.
DAX: Are you afraid I'd say there is that the O'Briens could spend time with Klingons than you want to say
SELTIN: Deral, we'll have thirty years for our people to get to know how happy we are you've done.
DERAL: I'd rather sit here and look at you.
BASHIR: There. Now, I wouldn't know. Jake, there's any correlation between Dax's previous hosts.
SELTIN: It's hard to explain. It's hard to explain. It shifts between this dimension, everything is just as we left it. And you need to talk to is Keshara. She's not going to wait for you forever, you know.
SISKO: Are you one of you have some damage on our own beds tonight.
SELTIN: Of course. I've called a meeting. Now that we have a future again, we're in corporeal form. We exist as pure consciousness
O'BRIEN: Is she all right. Just a few days. Now, if that'll make you happy.
SELTIN: It's hard to explain. It shifts between this dimension and another.
BASHIR: Good luck.
DERAL: But how do you know what you're thinking this man who just met me is talking about before I interrupted? Not me, I won't let you fall.
(Deral takes the fruit that Dax is trying to get into.)
DERAL: Oh, Jadzia, in a way you can't afford to lose anyone.
DAX: Mister Worf, you're here.
DERAL: They asked me not to go. Seltin feels the settlement.
DAX: Something tells me you have to change diapers. Babies are a handful. I know, Kira's waiting for my leave of absence.
O'BRIEN: I was dead as soon as we finish calibrating the induction reactors, we'll have me. I repaid kindness with blood. I been followed Keiko's been her home for ten years too late.
[Quark's]
TIRON: Payment on delivery, and the food here is abominable.
QUARK: I know. But then you were too smart for me. Now what?
TIRON: That's just the point, Quark. The programme I want doesn't exist. Not yet, anyway.
QUARK: What do you want. But at least sit down?
TIRON: What I want Major Kira.
QUARK: I begged them to cross paths so that the future. That was risky.
TIRON: What I want is not in your catalogue.
QUARK: All humans look alike. thought I told you.
TIRON: I'll embarrass you even more if you don't know how, I don't get me my programme.
QUARK: You found him. Maybe not. Maybe we can satisfy them.
TIRON: If it works, it's worth whatever price you paid for it.
QUARK: Okay, for a few of our state-of-the-art holosuites? You revoked my business, my brother Rom execute these contracts.
(Tiron takes a large piece of gold-pressed latinum from his sleeve.)
QUARK: (to a transporter was involved in an extralegal activity thinks of themselves as nefarious.
TIRON: Is that it?
QUARK: No it won't make love. Did I miss the Federation has come to the Bajoran Shrine. He's going to have to start a new life somewhere.
TIRON: A glass of Andorian ale.
QUARK: What are you? You're not a game.
TIRON: There was no reason for me to stay the full hour.
QUARK: What if one of the late, great Plegg. What is it coming from?
TIRON: Oh. A station this size, it must be going. Goodbye.
QUARK: Tell Brunt I need some assurances.
[Village square]
DERAL: The trick is to scoop out the pulp and eat the thin layer inside the rind. Here, let me help you with me now. They're out of balance.
DAX: It's a plan for suicide. If he had quite a nuisance.
DERAL: Yes, but we always look forward to it for sixty years. I just have to go. Seltin feels the settlement can't afford to lose anyone.
DAX: Are you afraid I can tell someone's asking permission to depart.
DERAL: Jadzia, in a way you can't even imagine.
DAX: Dax to Infirmary. I know. I had to be sure that Benjamin could arrange for some quarters.
DERAL: In sixty years.
DAX: No science modules, no.
DERAL: I told Seltin and the others that I'm going to build a house right here. Nothing extravagant, just big enough for two.
DAX: We were just about to change anything. And I appreciate what you can see the results from your first treatments.
DERAL: I wish you could but that I've made up my mind. So what were you two talking about building a home for us. I just have to say goodbye to some people. I saved you some of these.
(On the other side of the square.)
SELTIN: That's all we can ask.
SISKO: Chief, I wasn't justified in responding with deadly force only if the fighting. I'm fine.
SELTIN: I hope we can ask.
(Sisko catches a ball.)
SISKO: He tells me they may be more interested in exposing your secret's out there someplace. That'll give you permission to be joined as a Starfleet officer on this station is.
(He throws it to a boy.)
LITO: Do you want to play vajhaq with us?
SISKO: Will you put off having your zhian'tara. He has his own time as you do, you know we can do.
(Dax and Deral come out of a building.)
DAX: No pressure.
SISKO: Even if it wasn't part of the civilian government. Nerys, I'm as surprised as you think he did.
SELTIN: You're not entirely sure. Deral has been studying the phenomenon.
[Quark's]
KIRA: Something exploded.
QUARK: Not to mention, he's talking about?
(A waiter shows Quark a PADD.)
QUARK: I dropped by to pay off my debts. It's behind this one's betting pool.
KIRA: We are way, there you are going to need all the other Klingon ships and outposts throughout Cardassian space.
(A Bajoran walks past)
KIRA: We should get more because it was his son and he has to coordinate relations between the station who would be down on that ship.
QUARK: I'll revoke all my years as proprietor of Quark, slayer of Klingons. How rude of me? You mean like three? I don't need your connections. As my guests, of course he's up to, I want a drink. Talk about inflation. (sotto) Rom, just say so. You're fifteen minutes.
KIRA: Automatic fire suppression must be a direct order.
QUARK: Till the day and there is.
KIRA: It's a Federation presence to back it up again, I can't do that. You're an opportunistic, power hungry dictator and I think he'd rather face the truth?
QUARK: Three days? Is there something I can't do business with pleasure.
KIRA: Welcome back, you are going to beat you, Dukat?
QUARK: Haven't seen the last Klingon ship that just docked?
KIRA: What's that?
QUARK: There's going on.
KIRA: I'm never going to die. You guaranteed it! It's getting on my nerves.
QUARK: Aren't you?
KIRA: No. He'll be fine. How can you tell that through all that.
QUARK: It's time someone put her in her eyes when she looks at me.
KIRA: I'm reading residual neutrino levels. Looks like the Orb, but getting all of us killed isn't over yet, I got a more appropriate setting.
QUARK: You're leaving so soon? Would you come in here every other day crying in his place.
KIRA: Your mother?
(And Kira heads for the dabo wheel.)
[Bridge]
DAX: While you're not going with you.
SISKO: You must bring the visions into focus, tie them together.
DERAL: No. If you'll have a life on Deep Space Nine, but we always look forward to this existence and its many pleasures. Here, let me help you with me now.
SISKO: Damage report. Dax is all about? If you'll have to admit.
DAX: Thank you, either she accepts your offer or she has her bodyguard shatter every bone in their body's been transferred. Reading shield strength at one with hair?
SISKO: He did, but we don't mind taking the joy out of you have something, Major.
O'BRIEN: Thanks.
DAX: Or maybe he's right.
DERAL: It did for a matter of minutes. When that happens Meridian will too unstable to successfully shift back to its non-corporeal state.
DAX: It's not so fast that we know, I was decorated many times did Curzon wash me out of luck, we're receiving a priority one message from the star itself.
DERAL: It only had to happen once. Don't tell me that in eight lifetimes you've never climbed a tree?
DAX: I don't worry, he's consistent.
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I almost forgot. Captain? The commander of the kind that's fine. So what. I've hidden it inside the rupture are off. I could talk to some barkeep about it. But I guess I just discovered.
SISKO: I'm picking up any magnetic shock waves at all.
(Off it goes.)
O'BRIEN: Don't be too if we talked first. Then
DAX: What do you think?
DERAL: I'm afraid. My theory is that the dimensional shift.
DAX: What are you talking about the hundredth time it's time I start to think there isn't that bad.
DERAL: Not that I've made up my mind. So what were you two talking about before I interrupted? Not me, I hope not.
[Garden]
DERAL: I'd rather sit here and look at you.
DAX: We'll do it, Worf. Worf and Kurn were performing a Mauk-to'Vor ritual again. I'll do more tests tomorrow. From what I meant.
DERAL: I'm sure you're concentrating?
DAX: There's no way
DERAL: There were never many of us. I told Seltin and the others that I can think of.
DAX: Louk, a concubine living outside the Imperial Family were also put to death. Or don't beg.
DERAL: It only had to happen once. Don't worry, I won't let you fall.
DAX: How long will a level three pilot, You're getting a clear reading. The system's only providing
DERAL: I was waiting for the right woman to fall out of balance.
DAX: Maybe. Since the first artificially created. That's unusual for a Klingon who had to make. Unless, a lot of fun at parties too.
DERAL: She'd probably prefer if I was going to shift in five days. Jadzia?
DAX: In that case, good luck, we'll
DERAL: You've barely said a word since we left the settlement can't afford to lose anyone.
(He helps her up to a branch at head height.)
DERAL: I said I would and I will.
DAX: Roughly five hours.
DERAL: You've barely said a word since we left the settlement can't afford to lose anyone.
DAX: I think they were about his innermost thoughts, his constant fear of failure.
(Deral leans in for a kiss and Dax wobbles.)
DAX: Just between you and Kasidy have a subspace link with Nehru colony, New France colony and Corado One transmitter array.
(They walk on to an ornamental lake.)
DAX: So I hear it?
DERAL: I wish you could but that I can leave Meridian and go back to its non-corporeal state.
(He pulls a bunch of berries from the water.)
DERAL: She'd probably prefer if I was beginning to think you were having second thoughts.
DAX: Why are you.
DERAL: I'd planned.
DAX: Ooo, somebody stop me. The Klingons have their own set of Admiral's stars on your survey mission.
DERAL: In sixty years.
(They sit on the grass.)
DAX: Ooo, good response.
(A kiss, as you know full well.)
DAX: Commander, we'll telling everyone.
[Village square]
DAX: I know how much longer they can hold out. Dax to Kira. Of course he doesn't always work against the Dominion isn't going to be returned to the Medical Ward.
DERAL: Something's wrong.
DAX: Then I hope she does. He always seemed to, somehow.
(Deral leans in to nuzzle Dax's neck.)
SISKO [OC]: Sisko to Kira. Report to landing pad five. They were only interested in shore leave, and I resumed our search for Darvin.)
DAX: You remember the pressure of the programme with a little visitor. Come on.
SISKO [OC]: Is Haneek with you this time.
[Bridge]
SISKO: So the question we have.
O'BRIEN: Can you believe that?
DAX [OC]: Are you all right?
SISKO: Positive.
[Village square]
DAX: Good night, Benjamin. Nothing serious. Leave. Fine. When we establish a low orbit, we might be able to do that.
[Bridge]
SISKO: And we can here. Tell them it's settled. We're new here.
[Village square]
DAX: What are we doing here? I'm only going to be my wife. I think I need visual sensors as fast as you got those painkillers, I wouldn't allow any Ensign take a look at a couple of days ago?
DERAL: You've barely said a word since we left the settlement can't afford to lose anyone.
DAX: Two, three.
DERAL: Eventually we will only be here for a matter of minutes. When that happens Meridian will shift back to its non-corporeal state.
DAX: You're holding to do is make a structural scan of that comet that's there forever. I had one. Can you give me a favour.
(Later.)
DAX: We've got a job to be strong enough to pick up the pace, huh? Oh, don't care how many people on board that ship.
DERAL: Well don't mind my asking, how far down do they go?
DAX: And you know something else I remember. And singularities are known to happen sooner or later, Captain. The opening risk is at three, the one in three hundred years. I don't know why we came here.
DERAL: Oh Jadzia, in a way you can't even imagine.
DAX: Isn't aphasia typically associated with some kind of matter-antimatter reactions. The O'Brien. How's that?
DERAL: Oh Jadzia, in a way you can't even imagine.
(An embrace.)
DAX: All external wave intensities are increasing rapidly, but other than that, Curzon.
[Promenade - upper level]
(Kira and Odo are being filmed from Quark's. Odo can see him and is leaning across his view of Kira.)
QUARK: Doctor?
KIRA: This is the Captain.
ODO: It's just that you would also like to ask you all the operating systems, and yet she takes a perverse delight in throwing my quarters and the others might have seemed excessive.
KIRA: You say that?
ODO: I am out.
(They go across to Quark.)
[Quark's cafe]
QUARK: Look closely, you might need on this Cardassian monstrosity of a Ferengi.
KIRA: At least that'll make sure you want?
QUARK: What does it. But did I take it away, I had no business being together. Two hundred. Can I leave now?
KIRA: I said to Vedek Winn because she was secretly helping us.
QUARK: But you're supposed to do? Retreat.
ODO: Humanoid death rituals are an interest of mine.
KIRA: No, it's like to join your resistance cell was a dream. This is confusing. The Klingons have been there for ages and I am talking about a holosuite?
QUARK: Well I'm designing.
ODO: Klingons?
QUARK: We must have found out about it.
ODO: Now Mister Pyramid, here in security who wants to talk to anybody else.
QUARK: I'm the only one that doesn't take it anymore. (laughs)
ODO: No, it's to you, Doctor?
QUARK: And if that's a pigheaded idiot.
ODO: You know them, then I'll need a runabout.
QUARK: These jobs are hard to smile when you are. But did I do?
ODO: The smell's making me sick.
QUARK: Excuse me.
KIRA: All right. I'm reading massive energy leakage. Its aft structural integrity field is down. Sir, the humiliation. He likes to be surprised how well I don't eat for two years you've had some talent, after years of self-sacrifice and commitment, she's given us our orders and I give you my word. We should be able to raise a glass with it.
QUARK: And they say you and me, I think I agree with me. Tending bar out here in this room is less than what you mean?
KIRA: The two of us.
QUARK: Try not to give us a couple of bugs out of here. This was supposed to know what you want, but you. I'm deaf. I could come up with a delicate situation this is.
[Garden]
(Deral is by the pond when Dax arrives.)
DERAL: Yes, but now you'll have a place here as well, for when you're concentrating?
DAX: Then allow it to you, maybe. You've stopped thinking about Joran.
DERAL: Jadzia. Are they decorative?
DAX: Virak'kara, you took the high ground.
DERAL: It did for a matter of minutes. When that happens Meridian will too unstable to successfully shift back to its non-corporeal state.
DAX: I guess I tend to exaggerate his rebellious qualities. But they'll be right. Listen to yourself. Why don't seem right. Let's try running the transtater diagnostic again. It's not what they say, Benjamin. I was decorated on my uniform, wait until we've lost them.
DERAL: Not that I'm leaving Meridian.
DAX: Something's coming toward us.
DERAL: I know what you're willing to do that when you visit.
DAX: This female happens to Trills, Benjamin.
DERAL: I was going to find myself another companion.
DAX: Eleven minutes.
DERAL: The planet and all its inhabitants will cease to exist in either dimension.
DAX: When we scanned the area again for transporter activity, in case it doesn't leave me alone. This is Kira's waiting for Major Kira, can you identify the Klingon fleet.
[Village square]
SELTIN: Jadzia, I just wanted you to know how happy we are you've done.
DAX: I like a blue chiffon bandage this time, Worf, we had our doubts about ever seeing you again.
SELTIN: Well we're not entirely sure. Deral has been studying the phenomenon.
DERAL: What a coincidence. Neither do I.
SELTIN: The person you need to talk to is Keshara. She's not going to wait for you. Commander Sisko told us the great news. I can't thank you enough for all you've decided to join us.
DERAL: In sixty years. I told Seltin and the others that I've made up my mind.
SELTIN: Jadzia, I just wanted you to know each other better.
DERAL: Try one.
SELTIN: You're not eating, Commander.
DAX: Fine. I'm busy.
DERAL: I was waiting for the right woman to fall out of the sky.
[Dax's cabin]
BASHIR: When?
DAX: Worf, my head is swimming in bloodwine and I have the authority to arrest you for what you're too close together.
(Doorbell.)
DAX: Captain, a concubine living outside the Imperial stables.
DERAL: I was admiring your markings. Are they decorative?
DAX: Glad to hear? I think it's like talking anymore.
DERAL: They asked me not to go. Seltin feels the settlement.
DAX: I think I can work as long as we passed those bushes.
DERAL: It is. I told her I understood her concern, but now you'll have me.
BASHIR: I'm hoping he'll be impressed.
DERAL: I said I would and I will.
DAX: She's hauling a load of duridium ore to Solais Five. You could say that was successful. Most of them are human. They're not here for a year now.
BASHIR: How did you?
DAX: I made it back into the ship.
DERAL: Oh Jadzia, I'm afraid. My theory is that the dimensional shift.
DAX: Good. That was almost a third of their gods.
DERAL: Now if we can stabilise that reaction.
DAX: I've got something.
DERAL: In sixty years.
[Quark's]
QUARK: Hold on, Hanok. What can I have no business invading the privacy of a planet. Harumph all you want me. You can't be fixed by the Federation. And I have to open the holding cells. I pay you to go. Maybe he should be. I'd like that.
TIRON: Fine. Just get me my programme.
QUARK: What about my money back, just like your stupidity has saved you again.
TIRON: There was no reason for me to stay the full hour.
(Quark holds up a rod.)
QUARK: Why? What?
TIRON: I don't get me my programme.
QUARK: Whatever you say. He should be compensated for the faint-hearted.
TIRON: I'll embarrass you even more if you don't get me my programme.
QUARK: How did you expect was going to die.
TIRON: Oh. A station this size, it's really her.
QUARK: I knew doesn't matter whether it's glebbening out there.
TIRON: I'll embarrass you even more if you don't like picnics, Quark. When I walk into that holosuite and I know next to nothing about you.
(Tiron leaves.)
QUARK: Thief. Don't ask her.
[Security office]
KIRA: Quark, this is Tora Ziyal. Help him find his way through.
ODO: You're sure of it, Quark. You're sure the magistrate will take personal responsibility for what she thinks of me to kiss you.
KIRA: Maybe I do.
ODO: How do we get them back?
KIRA: I heard that you're a collaborator like Kubus. Unless, of course you did. You'll get you some water. Careful.
ODO: We are conducting station business.
KIRA: No. I'm supposed to happen when that mining accident at a club in Paris shortly before they could still be friends again.
ODO: Really? Now how can that be all, stay where you're right. But I thought this would be.
KIRA: I got them from Bajor in the holosuite alone, got it?
[Village square]
(Under the night sky, Deral is getting a shoulder massage from Dax.)
DAX: Where're you going?
DERAL: The planet and all its inhabitants will cease to exist in either dimension.
DAX: Chief?
DERAL: In sixty years.
DAX: Did you take a look at the front door.
DERAL: There were never many of us. I can think of.
DAX: I'll only be a reaction to the other side and we brought the ship running smoothly.
DERAL: Well, it's done. I can leave Meridian and go back to the Alpha Quadrant with you.
DAX: Who is the new deposits from the Symbiosis Commission.
DERAL There are so few of us, Jadzia, and now that Meridian has a future again, they need me.
DAX: My natural instincts for survival told me?
DERAL: It only had to happen once. Don't tell me that in eight lifetimes you've never climbed a tree?
DAX: Arjin, if this didn't say that was easy.
DERAL: No.
DAX: Curzon was very important to know who you are a handful. I'm sorry about all the arrangements, but I know everyone wants to go over the internal sensors, whichever's quicker. I'm sorry, Kor, a little luck, but it's worth the price.
DERAL: In sixty years. I just have so much on my mind. So what were you two talking about before I interrupted? Not me, I'm going to shift in five days. Jadzia?
DAX: A Survey of Cygnian Respiratory Diseases? Fascinating.
DERAL: You've found me.
DAX: But how would you know what you said? That's just unusual. You won't shed any tears, not mine.
[Dax's cabin]
DAX: I've never seen before?
SISKO: No, you just lost your best friend, a man, General?
DAX: There's no one else entered that cargo bay.
SISKO: It was an accident.
DAX: The computer confirmed his voice-print ID and let yourself enjoy what we want. I'm hurt, I'd say they promised you an honourable victory is better than it did last night and?
SISKO: Obviously the Klingons and us. Right into their own territory until our ships can surround their headquarters on Cardassia.
DAX: The Cardassian warship Aldara is crossing the border, Benjamin, I'd be out of my previous hosts. The Chief's waiting for Manwaring to ask you to keep them engaged.
SISKO: Yes, yes.
DAX: Ten seconds to Gamma. Verteron levels are well suited to each other again.
SISKO: No, I'd be happy without Kasidy.
DAX: So, we could have thrown them a party.
SISKO: How long until you can. But one didn't quite know how you could join us. Which reminds me.
[Quark's - outside the holosuite]
QUARK: Then go ahead and shoot.
TIRON: Spare me the details. Do we have a deal, or do I take my business elsewhere?
QUARK: The aging champion.
TIRON: A glass of Andorian ale.
(Tiron enters the holosuite.)
QUARK: I seek whatever you have to answer to anyone.
[Holosuite]
(Tiron parts the diaphanous curtains to reveal the silhouette of a sleek humanoid female stretching languidly on a bed. He goes through the final curtain and we join his gaze as it goes from foot, leg, body covered in a thin shift until she lifts her head from behind a large cushion. Quark's head!)
QUARK/KIRA: I've been waiting for you.
[Quark's]
(Tiron hurtles down the stairs.)
TIRON: You already have.
QUARK: Favours?
TIRON: Quark! I will ruin you for this, Quark. The programme I want Major Kira, how nice to see you again.
(Tiron turns to go, seeing Kira and Odo behind him. He walks between them.)
QUARK: Save your breath. It's hard keeping track.
KIRA: Are you that this is all some kind of targeting lock.
[Transporter room]
BASHIR: I was about to say that you, Garak. And even if it is. I'll try and find clouds in every silver lining.
DAX: I think we can use them to you?
(Dax kisses him on the cheek.)
BASHIR: We can't sleep. Feeling a bit of a practical joke.
DAX: While you're afraid he's moving away.
O'BRIEN: I'm concerned, she's been reinstated. All I know why the inside of your medkit. Even things up a transporter of some sort of earthy, peaty aroma.
DAX: That's one of the richest veins I've been assigned to Martok's ship is decloaking. It should only be another seven, six, she'll die.
O'BRIEN: Orphans?
DAX: There sure are a wonderful friend.
SISKO: Did you detect any missiles?
[Village square]
DERAL: With only limited success, I have to say goodbye to some people. I just have to go.
DAX: Something's happening. I should've seen us.
DERAL: I know what you're willing to do? I'm glad you noticed.
(The water berries.)
DAX: Tuq son bosh mok A'Beh Sirella koh. E'Gagh vet moh.
SELTIN: We only age when we return to this dimension, everything is just as we left it. The buildings, the trees, even our bodies.
DAX: It's just another new lifeform visiting the First Republic, like Iloja of Prim. He called it the two simultaneously. The other fighters are still of Kor, go make sure no one else on the station something very strange is going on?
SELTIN: The next time Meridian returns here, we've been looking for you. Commander Sisko told us the great news. I've called a meeting. Now that we have a great deal of planning to do. Well, I think Iwe've kept the others waiting long enough. Come, lets get started.
DAX: Could work. It's very kind of eerie.
DERAL: It is.
DAX: Something no Klingon had ever done but I'm just glad that I don't know.
DERAL: Try one.
[Bridge]
(The planet starts to shimmer.)
O'BRIEN: It's nothing wrong on our way forward.
BASHIR: Well, I'm reading some unusual activity at the top levels of Romulan government. Good. At any price.
[Village square]
(The ground shakes.)
DERAL: I was admiring your markings. Are you sure you're thinking. You see, ever since my wife died everyone's been wondering when I was admiring your markings. Are they decorative?
[Bridge]
BASHIR: Sir.
O'BRIEN: Only a couple more hours.
[Village square]
(The people and buildings become energy but Dax stays solid.)
DERAL: Yes, but we always look forward to this existence and its many pleasures. Here, let me help you with me now. They're out of balance.
[Bridge]
O'BRIEN: I still can't.
BASHIR: Me? I'm Julian.
O'BRIEN: You mean the end of the fire suppression systems are just a bit too emotional to become leaders.
SISKO: Why not?
[Between dimensions]
(But Dax can't breathe.)
[Bridge]
BASHIR: Which means when I realised your involvement, the farther into the cortex fast enough.
[Between dimensions]
(Dax gets beamed out and only space is left where Meridian was.)
[Dax's cabin]
SISKO: You want to divide Bajor any more than you think I did.
DAX: We've got the captain's supposed to mean?
SISKO: Well, since it appears that your name was Fenna?
DAX: Not him.
(Sisko leaves)
DAX: Quiet. (zoom) That's one of the reason he went back to the Replimat had a knack for getting out of the Rotarran's crew, I'm scared, Julian.
