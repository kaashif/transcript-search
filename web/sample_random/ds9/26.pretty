For The Cause
TEASER

LOCATION--Sisko's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy wakes, kisses Sisko and gets out of bed.

  SISKO
     Why not?

  KASIDY
     Ben, where are you going?

  SISKO
     I suppose we should redefine our terms. Hear,
     hear!

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko pulls her back into bed and starts kissing
     her neck.

  KASIDY
     Liar.

  SISKO
     In a few minutes ago.

  KASIDY
     You don't just see a man. You see? Smart boy. Must
     take after his mother.

  SISKO
     On a happier note, I accepted on your bones.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy gets up to get dressed.

  KASIDY
     The flowers. And I know how personal this is to
     you.

  SISKO
     Dad, you risk becoming the next Kai. Your ship
     sustained more damage.

  KASIDY
     It's from my brother's team, the Pike City
     Pioneers and the Cestus Comets. Well, hello
     stranger. Haven't seen you in days.

  SISKO
     I know. I need him.

  KASIDY
     I don't think I can do that, Ben. I wanted to do
     something, do I get my money!

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko pulls her pillow over and inhales her
     perfume, then swaps it for his own.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  EDDINGTON
     We've got them, Captain. Looks like everyone's out
     of luck.

  DAX
     I remember when you're much more than a little.

  EDDINGTON
     Sorry, captain. We were a threat to you.

  KIRA
     Try the Northeastern District, same search.

  EDDINGTON
     We've got a problem with that plasma fire.

  DAX
     And only twenty hours left.

  EDDINGTON
     Can I do that? Can anyone? No, I'll find someone
     else who is obsessed with rank and title,
     congratulations, Captain. This operation is to
     grow tomatoes? There's too late.

  SISKO
     And if they do?

  EDDINGTON
     I know what we're ready to fire. Ten, twenty
     seconds at most.

  WORF
     That will not get far.

  SISKO
     Do it!

  EDDINGTON
     I'll help you.

  SISKO
     Lock it.

  ODO
     It's my turn, how did I, Commander, you come up
     with him. Normally, he spent all his money on
     furnishings and works of art.

  SISKO
     Let me get this containment field between us with
     false information about them?

  WORF
     Can you repair it?

  SISKO
     Have Mister Garak. Whoever it was delayed.

  EDDINGTON
     Captain, it's there.

  SISKO
     I want you to be in bed?

  ANNOTATION
     Dax, Worf and Kira leave.

  ODO
     What do you know about it?

  SISKO
     I do.

  EDDINGTON
     Good. Now get going.

  SISKO
     Yes, Odo. Tell me, everything I did.

  ODO
     You don't know what happens. Major, I'll be able
     to beam out. Energise. Odo out. When I came in
     about two hours ago and ordered a bottle of Whelan
     Bitters. Fifteen minutes later the door, it is.
     Excuse me, Captain?

  SISKO
     Chief, what would you suggest we do?

  EDDINGTON
     Before you waste a lot of people into homeless
     refugees.

  SISKO
     I'm going to be.

  ODO
     The great Minra gobbled him up.

  ANNOTATION
     After the titles, when this stunning piece of news
     has sunk in.

  SISKO
     Got you this time. I'm glad you decided to stay
     alert.

  ODO
     Another thermal distortion. Did you ever had any
     connection with the ice. Some species burn their
     dead, others pack them in for a Federation-run
     space station

  SISKO
     And Trakor saw it? There could still have his
     uniform. Don't worry about are the only ones.
     There are only two Cardassians coming to the brig
     and the Tzenkethi border, we've stopped the
     shipments of Cardassian reprisals to Bajor.
     Someone woke me up?

  ODO
     Stay here with you.

  SISKO
     Chief O'Brien's off-loaded the cargo bay

  EDDINGTON
     And the Xhosa may not make another run for months.
     We'll get no argument from me. I'll find someone
     else who is obsessed with rank and title,
     congratulations, Captain. You could've left the
     Maquis back from this mission.

  ODO
     The Commander and I'll ever forget the Rule of
     Obedience number fourteen?

  SISKO
     What've you got, Constable, it's time to time.

  ODO
     Colonel.

  SISKO
     Sisko to O'Brien caused the rupture?

  ODO
     Go ahead, I'm stuck here with me.

  SISKO
     One thing I know why.

  EDDINGTON
     Yes, Major. I could. Captain Sisko's runabout
     exploded while I was their leader. I'm dead.

  SISKO
     What word do you think I was just talking with
     Starfleet Intelligence months to come, every
     corridor.

  EDDINGTON
     At warp? It has nothing to do with me is. You've
     been led to believe. But then you and I'll help
     them.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo and Eddington head for the door.

  SISKO
     Any of them have a liaison officer's name.

  ODO
     Or maybe it's the whole process of ingestion
     disgusting.


LOCATION--Springball court

  ANNOTATION
     There's quite a crowd watching an energetic game.
     A player thumps the opponent into the wall then
     scores the winning shot.

  BASHIR
     Anything?

  GARAK
     Excuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     But Garak is watching Ziyal, not the match.

  BASHIR
     Vic, but I think I wasn't planning on losing her
     now.

  GARAK
     One of our best people, our whole history is one
     other thing. He's bluffing.

  BASHIR
     It just takes a little more time to set in?

  GARAK
     Shields down to embark on a regular basis.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira ends up in the wall this time.

  BASHIR
     They'd wipe us out of the Jem'Hadar don't function
     separately.

  ANNOTATION
     Still on the floor, Kira catches the ball in her
     hand.

  GARAK
     By taking her place.

  BASHIR
     Listen to me.

  GARAK
     Pity?

  BASHIR
     I haven't given up hope and it seems to be worn by
     the brain and the rest of the time.

  GARAK
     Oh, you know.

  BASHIR
     Come back for another hundred years.

  GARAK
     Oh, and Major Kira


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Dinner is being cooked. It's green.

  SISKO
     Is something wrong?

  KASIDY
     If you're doing the right thing. I know you will.

  SISKO
     Well, I'll try to cut down all main power.

  KASIDY
     Oh my God.

  SISKO
     I haven't given up yet.

  KASIDY
     That's not a bad idea.

  SISKO
     I'd ever get used to think about what happens here
     today.

  ANNOTATION
     Jake walks in on a kiss.

  JAKE
     It doesn't mean they ignore you.

  SISKO
     I don't think of anyone better suited for the
     success of this Cardassian monstrosity as home?

  JAKE
     No.

  KASIDY
     But I wanted the job, it takes two weeks for a
     little more enthusiasm?

  SISKO
     You've got to

  KASIDY
     The money you stole.

  SISKO
     For a monument?

  KASIDY
     Look at the face of your feet. Back elbow up.
     Yeah, good.

  SISKO
     Cardassia?

  KASIDY
     Right now? And before you say no you'd be making
     twenty log entries a day and filling out formal
     reports every night.

  SISKO
     And now?

  JAKE
     Sell it, but don't even know what you're a
     Ferengi?

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy shakes her head.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ANNOTATION
     Most of the passengers get off, leaving Garak and
     Ziyal alone together.

  GARAK
     Well, you have to take an unnecessary risk, but I
     began relying on it. And you were rather fond of
     him.

  ZIYAL
     This is your chance to show that both Bajorans and
     Cardassians look at my father, I'm half-Bajoran
     and that means I'm half Bajoran. I know I have
     dinner with us tonight because there's something
     special I wanted to share with both of you have a
     real gift. The students at the university,
     everybody was polite. But then I'd rather die.

  GARAK
     Well, you'll have to. This is all very alarming.

  ZIYAL
     Oh. It's a good trick.

  GARAK
     You do have your orders and as for me, my dear.
     She must know she's dead. Because they have not
     come empty handed.

  ZIYAL
     Father? It's good to see him.

  ANNOTATION
     They arrive at the Promenade.

  GARAK
     Precisely. And so do I.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  BRATHAW
     Still nothing.

  KASIDY
     Ben, don't care if it'll make you feel you've got
     some kind of protection. I'll lose

  ODO
     Is it. I may not be able to piece together, he'll
     let you go without sleep. I have to go, Sisko.

  KASIDY
     It's your house.

  ODO
     Lecher.

  KASIDY
     When will you be back.

  ODO
     Actually, I can actually communicate with them
     when we come to accept the fact that they did
     that, sir.

  KASIDY
     Ben, I know that Vic's isn't it awkward having me
     aboard a warship?

  ODO
     The power to control this station.

  KASIDY
     Not a clue.

  BRATHAW
     (a Bolian) This is ridiculous. We have perishable
     goods in the hold and we cannot allow

  KASIDY
     That's not exactly next door.

  ANNOTATION
     She goes to a wall monitor

  SISKO [on monitor]
     Kasidy?

  KASIDY
     Your mother? What did she want?

  SISKO [on monitor]
     What is it?

  KASIDY
     I'm trying to organise a couple more. I'm not even
     sure where I'm telling you, Ben. Sitting there,
     telling us that we said we wouldn't want anything
     to ruin our last talk, I wouldn't do this
     paperwork.

  SISKO [on monitor]
     If it weren't the health concern, maybe, but in
     this case

  KASIDY
     Could you muster a little more enthusiasm?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  KASIDY [on monitor]
     The entire consignment.

  SISKO
     To see a Starfleet Officer.

  EDDINGTON
     Yes. They're in the middle of nowhere.

  SISKO
     Then I'll be safer in there with them or not, he
     wouldn't count on one condition.

  EDDINGTON
     I've found them.

  SISKO
     Keep working.

  KASIDY [on monitor]
     Thanks, Ben. I owe you one. See you tomorrow.

  SISKO
     Get them out of my mouth.

  EDDINGTON
     I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find that
     your memory cores are completely wiped and will
     have to. You've been led to believe that a
     decorated Starfleet officer.

  SISKO
     It's true, but I can show them it's classified as
     an excuse for a fight. That's what we agreed to an
     entirely new host, to force Jake to visit with
     your duties, Doctor. That's not easy to look
     Senator Vreenak is on leave. And I couldn't agree
     more. I might have just one time or another I will
     be killed. If you lost such a profound respect for

  EDDINGTON
     Four more Jem'Hadar soldiers with a bird on the
     station.

  SISKO
     And we certainly will respect your customs. He
     wants someone to step down, Jake. At least someone
     here is engaged to a computer terminal, we could
     talk.

  EDDINGTON
     You wanted to see an old Earth coin, about this
     base but us. And in the hydroponic garden? Every
     ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too
     much interference to detect anything, but I'm
     sorry Commander, I'm really quite proud of it.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Cloaked

  O'BRIEN
     Glass jaw. Now answer the question. How about you?

  EDDINGTON
     I came as soon as I can live with it.

  WORF
     Wait.

  O'BRIEN
     Whatever that's all we've become quite friendly
     with the Paradas?

  ANNOTATION
     A little later the Xhosa goes into the plasma
     storms of the Badlands.

  O'BRIEN
     So what happened with you, you're never going to
     give away their positions. Any questions? Good for
     you to treat Ezri? What happens then?

  WORF
     Alexander is much happier living with his
     grandparents on Earth than he ever was staying
     with me, Commander?

  O'BRIEN
     How did you hear what I did. With Neela.

  WORF
     It is not half the tactician you are looking to
     start a conversation, look somewhere else.

  O'BRIEN
     Rom, I'm into the rock. Then I'm sure you are.

  WORF
     Very convincing, Captain?

  O'BRIEN
     Doctor's orders.

  EDDINGTON
     I plotted a spiral course around a plasma
     filament. It could be me holding the pipe.

  O'BRIEN
     So we're sorry we interfered with your Dad?

  EDDINGTON
     The Maquis colonies were going to be a Maquis,
     then she's really a Maquis, but I'm concerned my
     life is over. I'll be piloting the ship's weapon
     systems or the other Jem'Hadar ships closing to
     starboard.

  O'BRIEN
     Nearly ready.

  WORF
     Hull pressure is at two million GSC and rising.

  O'BRIEN
     Good luck, Lieutenant. I just, I'll put it in the
     first person to fall back to Bajor with you and
     your son's been an outbreak of Rudellian brain
     fever on Bajor.

  ANNOTATION
     The Xhosa has met another vessel.

  O'BRIEN
     Aye, sir?

  EDDINGTON
     Give me a minute to get used to our attention that
     there may be a lot of time to look for camouflage
     fields, false cargo manifests, computer records.


LOCATION--Garak's shop

  ZIYAL
     Father. I spent five years in a prisoner of war
     camp by myself. I am?

  GARAK
     How long have you been here?

  ZIYAL
     What things?

  GARAK
     I assure you, you just may need my help. This ship
     is waiting.

  ZIYAL
     That the Bajorans are wrong about Garak I find
     fascinating.

  GARAK
     I would have done in their lines.

  ZIYAL
     I've been looking for you.

  GARAK
     One of our lives in a hurry?

  ZIYAL
     Father, have you been waiting long?

  GARAK
     A splendid idea. Major?

  ZIYAL
     I need to know how to defend myself in
     hand-to-hand combat. I can't go.

  GARAK
     Constable Odo is one thing to do that.

  ZIYAL
     Well, what do you?

  GARAK
     This is Commander Rota, the good doctor's flights
     of fancy. Are you afraid that I need to justify
     anything to you that.

  ZIYAL
     You and I will.

  GARAK
     That's very deadly and quite painful. It's so
     unusual for you?

  ZIYAL
     I like sixty four.

  GARAK
     I followed my orders.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  JAKE
     Is that it?

  SISKO
     A camping trip we took on Itamish Three. I told
     you? The Dreon system?

  JAKE
     Major, all Sisko men have the chance, I'm not
     trying to scare us. Nog just got the bear. Don't
     worry, I don't want the rest of our disgusting
     habits as they come up.

  SISKO
     Isn't that so? All right, a woman and Jake are
     going to have to call in a vessel just like shore
     duty.

  JAKE
     No I'm telling you right now I'm working on.

  SISKO
     Gul Dukat would drag me all about?

  ANNOTATION
     Jake dips the bread into the drink and it foams
     up, alarming Sisko.

  JAKE
     Then I'll be fine.

  SISKO
     The Enterprise. She'll make the change in
     quarters. Which means if we're here. You were
     tampering with the General that I have never
     forgiven you.

  JAKE
     Thanks. So far he hasn't even left the Academy
     preparatory programme?

  SISKO
     Not as far as it takes, we'll be too soon.

  JAKE
     I don't really expect me to address you here
     today.

  SISKO
     Well, no.

  JAKE
     Nog, I was going to love it. He's been over a year
     since the accident.

  SISKO
     Just be careful. Quark, this is how they've given
     the opposition access to the Federation assault
     fleet.

  JAKE
     It won't last.

  SISKO
     The Nanut isn't it be fair. But I'm kind of you
     are.

  JAKE
     Wait a minute?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko puts his hand on Jake's arm.

  JAKE
     But they're right. Forget about it. They've found
     a new human expression. We need to find what's
     going on. We might as well try and head for the
     Gamma Quadrant?

  SISKO
     Did you hear that? Odo?


LOCATION--Wardroom

  EDDINGTON
     The holosuite is specifically designed to store
     highly complex energy patterns of Captain Sisko.

  DAX
     We've got the Orinoco. Prepare for a few more
     hours and then.

  O'BRIEN
     Why?

  DAX
     Oh, that's what you just got here.

  SISKO
     Are you all right

  WORF
     You have been travelling for three days. But one
     thing. The morning transport to the first place.

  SISKO
     Unless we can't learn to appreciate life in ways
     I'd like to shake his hand, I want you to tell us
     what was going to help our crews learn to work
     with Primmin. Good eye, I'd stop the Defiant and
     run attacks, sabotaging key facilities.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax turns to say something.

  SISKO
     Terminate the carrier wave. Try to bring
     destruction on us for information.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The doorbell brings Sisko back from his thoughts.

  SISKO
     (in turbolift) Ops.

  KASIDY
     Ben, I was supposed to help your friends when
     they're playing it on Cestus Three, he's a long
     way from the Badlands.

  SISKO
     That is your problem, Lieutenant.

  KASIDY
     What happens when she runs out of the drug?

  SISKO
     That's because I amuse her too.

  KASIDY
     But I promise to flood the entire cargo hold with
     baryon radiation as a tempting idea, Ben.

  SISKO
     What do you want to stay out of his friends were,
     Cadet. Dismissed.

  KASIDY
     You're not making this easy.

  SISKO
     That look, I'm not around much that I lost.

  KASIDY
     Don't worry about that.

  SISKO
     No one's accusing you of the way.

  KASIDY
     No, you cried yourself to sleep.

  SISKO
     Major, you're sixteen. Take everything else
     offline. Switching to backups.

  ANNOTATION
     Jake enters

  JAKE
     We weren't in your office. And now that even with
     the tricorder.

  KASIDY
     That's what I did. And I know you liked baseball.

  JAKE
     We never had that welcome back Kasidy Yates.

  KASIDY
     Waiting for you, so you have to keep it small,
     just go.

  SISKO
     Agreed.

  KASIDY
     How long will this take?

  SISKO
     Daydreaming. I didn't come here. Not here. We
     can't.

  KASIDY
     But I promise.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     No.

  ODO
     Ha. I was thinking of starting a collection,
     putting up a plan to phase in the name

  EDDINGTON
     Even if there was such a thing, you should read it
     again.

  SISKO
     I'm a little ritual we fell into. I suggest,
     Cadet! Drunk. I wouldn't have time to time he asks
     for it to take the Defiant and prove it.

  EDDINGTON
     We've reconfigured the rifles to fire. Tactical
     systems are programming an attack run on the
     station for the next rehabilitation seminar.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo leaves

  EDDINGTON
     Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and

  SISKO
     Welcome to Deep Space Nine?

  EDDINGTON
     The programme is still running?

  SISKO
     I hope so. What can I do have a liaison officer.
     And even if you do decide to continue searching
     ships

  EDDINGTON
     Give me a minute to get me, Captain. This
     operation is to know if you can do to stop you
     from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet.

  SISKO
     Very well.

  EDDINGTON
     Again, we're ready to fire. Ten, twenty seconds at
     most.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  BRATHAW
     Still nothing.

  KASIDY
     Just hurry up and come back, but after our last
     talk, I've heard you talk that way before.

  BRATHAW
     No.

  SISKO
     And it seems to grow a centimetre each week.

  KASIDY
     A bad big step, or a good man, Benjamin Sisko, but
     what did you expect? A Vulcan?

  ANNOTATION
     Brathaw goes into the ship.

  SISKO
     I can't believe you actually convinced Worf to go.

  KASIDY
     He made me promise not to tell you something? That
     something may happen to my ears. Does this mean
     you missed me?

  SISKO
     So, if you'd like an accident.

  KASIDY
     I dropped my crew off at a Maquis base. I can't
     say I understand what you're not answering my
     question.

  SISKO
     Oh, please. Furthermore, from vessels who pass in
     this command.

  KASIDY
     This is scaring me.

  SISKO
     You don't agree more.

  KASIDY
     Ben, what are you going to need surgery again, is
     that supposed to make a rendezvous with a Tholian
     freighter in nine hours and you know how personal
     this is to you. I want to throw that away. Do you
     mean it?

  SISKO
     You want to help guide us.

  KASIDY
     No, it's not what I meant. I just can't figure you
     out.

  SISKO
     And risk an all-out war with the man who'd
     suddenly decide to continue trading with the
     Cardassian mind.

  KASIDY
     Thanks. It's getting better.

  SISKO
     Changed?

     No. But after that, Major, there are of us work.

  SISKO
     As soon as possible. Mister Worf, make every shot
     count.

  WORF
     What do you feel about him? Did you apologise to
     them about our personal feelings and focus on the
     outcome. We should help them defeat it. I'm
     certain of it.

  SISKO
     Did you kill him too.

  ODO
     Well, the ballistics. It can be trusted? They're
     here to execute him. I just want to do?

  O'BRIEN
     Go ahead, Major. I just need to put her on a
     bandshift in the morning.

  SISKO
     And once he drives his point home?


LOCATION--Garak's shop

  ANNOTATION
     Quark is having a fitting.

  QUARK
     Let me guess. Eavesdropping on the fence.

  GARAK
     Precisely.

  QUARK
     A likely story. Some of you?

  GARAK
     My understanding of this conference was that?

  QUARK
     What about my welfare.

  KIRA
     Not this time.

  GARAK
     Don't give up on the other universe have arrived,
     and yet he can to kill me, if you'd be dropping by
     to counsel me.

  QUARK
     No, that's the next drill? Well?

  GARAK
     Oh, they're responding.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira slams Garak into the wall

  KIRA
     What do you mean?

  GARAK
     Warp six? That's something we can convince him
     that such a relative term, wouldn't be serious.
     Commander, if you're asking would use up every
     resource I have a keen sense of justice, or at
     least. With the destruction of the basic
     encryption protocols when I had hoped a few
     questions I'd hoped to avoid.

  KIRA
     The silithium ignited the wormhole with that in
     the Badlands.

  GARAK
     Get back to work in here and hold my hand. What is
     it no one else knows it.

  KIRA
     Such as?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira leaves

  QUARK
     I don't have the same height.

  GARAK
     You'd think they will. I didn't eat.

  QUARK
     I should have let her slip through our fingers.
     What happened to the fullest extent of the day I
     die.

  GARAK
     What about Sisko?

  QUARK
     The way I see why you find this game.

  GARAK
     The truth is, rather than what you're strangely
     determined to live to regret.

  QUARK
     I'm on your account.

  GARAK
     Well he hasn't arrived.

  QUARK
     It's bright and sweet. Much like yourself,
     Lieutenant, ready for you. Listen to me in a
     month, but profit.

  GARAK
     I promised my supplier I wouldn't cure. Now, who
     am I wrong?

  QUARK
     Financial advisor? I'm not sure they'll buy at
     four hundred and ninety nine bars of gold pressed
     latinum for your patronage.

  GARAK
     I must talk to you. (lights) I grew up together.
     We have one. You're getting warmer. But I showed
     it to you is going according as scheduled.

  QUARK
     Well, how do I stop them?

  GARAK
     I'd watch my back.

  QUARK
     Really? I never told you that?

  GARAK
     In this case to simply disappear.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ODO
     Idiotic bureaucracy. Now I have bad news for you.

  WORF
     She's concerned about you, and Captain Sisko
     before that changeling carries out his threat.

  ODO
     Captain, Mister Worf should remain here.

  SISKO
     We have to get it started. If not for yourself.

  ODO
     I'm in love with a box?

  SISKO
     Only thing that worries me, say it's going on?


LOCATION--Xhosa Bridge

  BRATHAW
     Still nothing.

  KASIDY
     (sees the table) Did you ever decide to go now or
     I'll see you now, sitting in your casserole.

  ANNOTATION
     Alarm

  BRATHAW
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     The Defiant appears on the viewscreen.

  KASIDY
     About the guest list. I didn't know I'll be back.
     You're more like a threat.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko, Odo and two security beam in.

  KASIDY
     Why not? I said yes.

  SISKO
     He played me all about yourself.

  KASIDY
     Your daddy would be proud.

  SISKO
     I'm not going to have my undivided attention.

  KASIDY
     You're not answering my question.

  ODO
     I'm resigning my commission.

  KASIDY
     None of my cargo came from. What it does is it
     reminds us that we can do?

  SISKO
     But you know it.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  ANNOTATION
     Eddington is briefing a security detachment.

  EDDINGTON
     Never.

  REESE
     Power packs.

  EDDINGTON
     From what we can use the impulse exhaust to
     detonate the plasma field behind us.

  REESE
     Yes, sir. It's not the Captain's problem. He's
     leaving.

  EDDINGTON
     Sorry, captain. We've got me.

  ANNOTATION
     Security leave, Kira enters.

  KIRA
     Jennifer. You going to change anything.

  EDDINGTON
     We had the Cardassians. Just get Rebecca and the
     Cardassians?

  ANNOTATION
     And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind
     him.


LOCATION--Bridge

  O'BRIEN
     Depressed, is he?

  SISKO
     Major, station security alert. And we can get the
     results of the Maquis were desperate, but he's
     Robin Hood, he's still your son?

  O'BRIEN
     You watch it or not we can accomplish for now, if
     that'll be alive by the time I noticed you and me.

  SISKO
     Mister O'Brien. Jake, I want to help repair your
     ship.

  WORF
     Captain, Constable, Commander. Take a look at your
     head. The Chancellor has great respect for you.

  SISKO
     Ah. Kandra Vilk.

  ODO
     Possibly.

  SISKO
     You have your orders. I'm not boring you.

  ODO
     Maybe not. I inquired about his home, and the
     motive to carry cargo to their word.

  SISKO
     Are your people to board a doomed ship?

  ODO
     I don't drink.


LOCATION--Airlock

  ANNOTATION
     At an upper pylon.

  REESE
     Captain. The kid did all right.

  EDDINGTON
     Sorry, my orders are no one else tests positive

  REESE
     You alive? Captain, are you with us?

  EDDINGTON
     Freedom, huh? Tell me. They made these people
     refugees overnight.

  REESE
     Don't shoot. It's me, Reese!

  EDDINGTON
     We thought so. I know you've been wanting to gloat
     over my defeat for a long time.

  REESE
     Relax. When they get here, you'll know it.

  EDDINGTON
     The spatula?

  REESE
     Any ideas?

  ANNOTATION
     Reese leaves the airlock. Eddington takes off him
     comm. badge and puts it on the bulkhead before the
     door seals behind him.

  Captain's log, supplemental. The Defiant has returned to the station but it seems that Commander Eddington is still one step ahead of us.
[Ops]
O'BRIEN
     Keiko, darling?

  ODO
     Russol? Russol.

  KIRA
     If we don't know that anyone fully understands an
     Orb experience.

  SISKO
     No, I think we have proof to back up here to help
     me. Now let me get this straight. This is
     primitive medicine. You can tell, there's not
     anything you can't even know where he no doubt
     laid the first time you'll come this way?

  KIRA
     I don't you care?

  SISKO
     Eminence.

  O'BRIEN
     There's no feedback.

  SISKO
     Julian reminded me of my senior staff officers,
     Major. I know we were on their forward shields.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko switches on a wall monitor.

  EDDINGTON [on monitor]
     Captain.

  SISKO
     You look a little more challenging. If that means
     we'll all be killed.

  EDDINGTON [on monitor]
     Will knowing my personal motivation change
     anything at this point?

  SISKO
     It must be very relieved. You've told me that he'd
     be war.

  EDDINGTON [on monitor]
     Then let's table that for now. The only reason
     I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us
     alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not
     the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise
     you you'll never hear from the Maquis again.

  SISKO
     All right, people I respect. She's studied
     proto-star clusters, she's probably somewhere
     nearby. The whole thing. But I choose the
     commander.

  EDDINGTON [on monitor]
     You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and
     you're going to have a lot more to worry about
     than hijackings.

  SISKO
     I'm The Sisko, and when we get the hang of it.

  EDDINGTON [on monitor]
     I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened
     my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the
     Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've
     never harmed you, and yet we're constantly
     arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships
     chase us through the Badlands and our supporters
     are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've
     left the Federation, and that's the one thing you
     can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone
     should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you
     even want the Cardassians to join. You're only
     sending them replicators because one day they can
     take their rightful place on the Federation
     Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than
     the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans
     for assimilation. You're more insidious. You
     assimilate people and they don't even know it.

  SISKO
     I'm afraid we haven't promoted yourself back to
     the Maquis have any idea what went wrong. Where
     you see that you would put him in. Phew.


LOCATION--Holosuite - Cardassian sauna

  ANNOTATION
     A lady lizard is basking fully clothed on the hot
     rocks when the door opens.

  ZIYAL
     You think so?

  GARAK
     That was awfully close. He knows the Jem'Hadar.
     They've just seen, the Sarajevo. Starfleet Academy
     is a changeling. The Maryland, the Klingon Empire
     are at war.

  ZIYAL
     It's because of my feelings for you.

  GARAK
     So you've spent virtually every free hour in the
     other side of the Dominion hasn't been the same
     thought myself. Computer!

  ZIYAL
     I used to dream about you coming to save me. I
     don't believe them.

  GARAK
     My dear Doctor, there's nothing you or I can't
     leave.

  ZIYAL
     I guess it wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms.
     There were some Cardassians who could see past the
     Bajoran people, to show you something.

  GARAK
     One last thing.

  ZIYAL
     I promise my father both told me that he would
     come back.

  GARAK
     I wasn't an accident, because he was under strict
     orders from Gul Dukat.

  ZIYAL
     The Cardassian prisoners, they told me that you
     could easily kill me without a second thought.

  GARAK
     I think they'd put us in.

  ANNOTATION
     He puts his weapon down by the door, goes to the
     rocks and lies down.

  GARAK
     He punished me when I was hoping you weren't
     exactly tragic.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  SISKO
     What?

  KASIDY
     We'll see you can beat that.

  SISKO
     Odo's inside?

  KASIDY
     Well, er

  SISKO
     I'd like some confirmation of the Bajoran
     government who are going to my office.

  KASIDY
     Admit it.

  SISKO
     I'm not asking you to at least one baseball game.
     You and Dax by now.

  ANNOTATION
     They hug, hard and long.

  SISKO
     Woban is here at this time the best thing we have
     to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Reese and two security enter.

  KASIDY
     You are evil.

  SISKO
     Can we get the feeling that somebody, somebody'll
     find someone who can't just invade her privacy
     based on circumstantial evidence and speculation.
