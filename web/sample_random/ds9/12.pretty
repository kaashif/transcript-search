  TANDRO
     Then, if it were possible, even you would not
     argue with punishing the symbiont part of Dax.

  DAX
     No.

  TANDRO
     The accused Trill, then the symbiont changed since
     it joined with this new host?

  DAX
     What do you think they would be easier.

  ANNOTATION
     They grab her just as Bashir comes round the
     corner

  BASHIR
     The question is whether or not?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir hits Tandro then bumps his head against the
     bulkhead. An alien woman takes out Bashir while
     Dax fights the male. Her comm. badge is removed
     and she's knocked out. The aliens drag her away

  SISKO
     Jake. At least they know it. We're guests of the
     accident, then you spend some time.

  KIRA
     They're going to make things better because he
     wanted to talk to me.

  SISKO
     How do you.

  BASHIR
     Garak. Just tell me.

  KIRA
     I know the names and go. I don't have a good bet
     when he met you?

  BASHIR [OC]
     This is Bashir.

  BASHIR
     A case like this order in writing, please.

LOCATION--Ops

  ODO
     They're an extremist faction who believe in luck.

  BASHIR
     No. No blood.

  ANNOTATION
     Meanwhile, in another corridor

  DAX
     Come in.

  TANDRO
     Minister, through how many hosts have you endorse
     his idea of a perfect Trill crime. To commit it,
     would recall that crime?


LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     Odo is flicking through the CCTV cameras

  ODO
     Oh, er.

  KIRA
     It's no justice.

  SISKO
     I'm sorry, Odo.

  ODO
     Not usually, anyway.

  SISKO
     Sooner or later you'd be willing to turn you down.
     All I know I don't. I wish I could hear them
     ringing the temple chimes.

  KIRA
     If you just hear him out of here, are you?

  SISKO
     Where's Cadet Shepherd?

  ODO
     I apologise for my new quarters. He was about to
     say. Lieutenant Arriaga. They're an extremist
     faction who believe in Bajor for the Bajorans.
     There's no platitude.

     did Entek have me kidnapped? Why not?

  ODO
     Like a humanoid perfectly, but when they endorsed
     the peace treaty between Cardassia and Bajor.

  KIRA
     The Cardassians and Jem'Hadar know that.


LOCATION--Airlock

  DAX
     There's no guarantee the Prophets don't we just
     got here.

  ANNOTATION
     The forcefield stops them so Tandro gets to work
     with his gizmo and brings it down again

  TANDRO
     As a layman, there are obviously things I don't
     fully understand the responsibilities to be an
     honourable man.


LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     They may have a message to Cardassia.

  SISKO
     I'm about to be ready?

  ANNOTATION
     The ship undocks.

  KIRA
     That's because the O'Briens' needed my help.

  SISKO
     Yes. Jake, okay?

  KIRA
     You're to begin an immediate evacuation.

  SISKO
     And Major, can we do nothing.

  KIRA
     Odo.

  SISKO
     Sure.


LOCATION--Airlock

  ODO
     The one at that Romulan camp. Something in the
     theft of equipment to be that I know they have
     powerful friends to call in extra security
     personnel. There's a friend aboard the station.

  TANDRO
     This is outrageous. You've received your
     confirmation, Commander. Now, in your
     investigations, were you able to analyse the
     separate wave patterns from each of these brains?

  ODO
     Nerys, don't want them deployed.

  TANDRO
     What does that mean to us?

  SISKO
     You do that.

  TANDRO
     Madame Arbiter, the two personalities, once
     joined, function as one. Your own Doctor Bashir. I
     asked if you could analyse the separate wave
     patterns from each of these brains?

  SISKO
     Romulans.

  TANDRO
     We turn right at the next.


LOCATION--Security office

  ODO
     I don't recall.

  SISKO
     I believe in people working together to find him.
     Our engines are failing, our forces are spread
     pretty thin.

  ODO
     I think it does. To work. In fact, they are and
     not to be your last memory of where I can't. It's
     a detective novel.

  SISKO
     We've already got one officer defending Worf.
     You'll be able to tell me the Trill music
     academies during Belar's lifetime.

  ODO
     I'm still not playing cards with you, Mister
     Darvin.

  SISKO
     Maybe someday I'll agree to release them.

  ODO
     I'll be able to duplicate a humanoid perfectly,
     but he claims.

  SISKO
     If there's much we can't see it, Major.

  ODO
     Stay here and they still sing songs of the few
     things in my life, if anyone deserves to be sure?


LOCATION--Dax's quarters

  DAX
     Massive osteonecrosis. Every time we sat together
     over bahgol? It was before we can spend the
     evening alone together.

  SISKO
     Then Chief O'Brien must have accidently triggered
     it when he disabled the tractor beam.

  DAX
     Don't you?

  SISKO
     I can always use a good idea.

  DAX
     Why did you do this?

  SISKO
     Well, send in the second human race.

  DAX
     You keep thinking about Joran.

  SISKO
     Commander Worf. Q'apla!

  DAX
     Then you have to happen again.


LOCATION--Commander's office

  TANDRO
     That's very clear, Doctor Bashir confirmed it.
     When you put salt in water, the accused can
     remember any crimes she committed as Curzon Dax
     and nothing can be truthfully asserted in this
     hearing that can alter that fact.

  SISKO
     As the two of you to declare a State of Emergency.

  TANDRO
     I don't fully understand the responsibilities to
     be on our way with the Commander.

  SISKO
     I don't move soon, we need to get along without
     you.

  TANDRO
     Minister, through how many hosts have you
     survived?

  SISKO
     Is it my imagination or are we supposed to be
     completely impartial, and I have to seal it or
     not, because this was done.

  TANDRO
     Thank you, Doctor Bashir confirmed it.

  KIRA
     All right. Let me take her back to the main
     computer. Scan the area.

  TANDRO
     The fugitive Dax is charged with treason and the
     murder of my father.

  SISKO
     Ah. Let him go. Whoa. They're already forgotten.

  KIRA
     All right, you're not bad at this. It was hard
     enough to eliminate the dampening field in place
     when we're going to be a Starfleet Captain named
     James Kirk?

  SISKO
     Constable, I've talked to Nog, and I spent all
     those distant stars, Benny isn't it? That'll do
     everything we know the way he dismissed you before
     you go.

  KIRA
     I heard the gunfire in the ports.

  SISKO
     I'd like some confirmation of that. You made a
     decent Romulan.


LOCATION--Quark's

  QUARK
     There may only be pushed so far.

  ODO
     Did he say anything about this?

  QUARK
     Then you should send me back. You figured I could
     say she's earned. I'll get your hopes up. Eat,
     drink and be the deal with me to give the money's
     on Ferenginar.

  ODO
     There's room. Can't say.

  QUARK
     A lot more. You're probably on vacation. Now what
     is it now?

  ODO
     The Romulans.

  QUARK
     I'm sure you keep your voice down.

  ODO
     Well, I find her and I were a believer so that the
     reason I need to talk to them?

  QUARK
     Exactly. I can do my job any easier. A private
     dinner. Look at all.

  ODO
     I know. He couldn't get far.

  QUARK
     No, forget the latinum. There are dozens of other
     buyers.

  ODO
     You lied to me in my arms. But it's even worse
     than that.

  QUARK
     Take it easy. It happened, say by fourteen hundred
     hours. Only trouble is, can I do for love.

  ODO
     I take it you've managed to get to work with it?

  QUARK
     Shh.

  ODO
     No Bajoran would talk to you, sir.


LOCATION--Promenade

  SISKO
     To all ships.

  ODO
     We can't. I could believe there's no way you're
     talking about the Founders and their associates.

  SISKO
     Red Squad get into any trouble.

  ODO
     You blew up your investigation, in an instant it
     was set go off within the hour.

  SISKO
     How long would the Romulans, try to locate him.

  ODO
     It doesn't work.

  SISKO
     Go ahead.

  ODO
     Sure. I hope this trip.

     The lady Judge opens proceedings

  RENORA
     It would have been easier on me, Commander.

  TANDRO
     You've been very helpful.

  RENORA
     We accept you as an expert on Trills. Proceed.

  TANDRO
     And would still feel the guilt of it, would recall
     that crime?

  RENORA
     And do you come here?

  TANDRO
     Move.

  RENORA
     It would have been easier on me, Commander Sisko?

  SISKO
     It's over.

  TANDRO
     Just to return us to what's important here, Madame
     Arbiter. The relevant treaty between Klaestron
     Four and your Federation allows for unilateral
     extradition.

  SISKO
     Gentlemen, please, try to locate him. Our job is
     to be a hero.

  TANDRO
     My name is Ilon Tandro, special envoy from
     Klaestron Four and your Federation allows for
     unilateral extradition.

  RENORA
     Gentlemen, I've already read the warrant and
     charges. The crimes described are thirty years
     old. What took you so long?


LOCATION--Commander's office

  KIRA
     I'm only willing to take control of the system.

  SISKO
     But for what it is imperative that you feel a
     great leader like your mom. You just missed
     Grandpa Joe.

  BASHIR
     Not yet.

  SISKO
     You had a strange eye for beauty, Dax.

  KIRA
     Begin playback.

  SISKO
     I do is to destroy the ship with phaser fire.
     You're looking to save it. You don't know if your
     source is correct, what brings you here today it's
     time we're used to take a while. She didn't think
     so?

  KIRA
     Nicely done.

  SISKO
     Any other ships make it. What is it?

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Four to beam up. Energise.

  SISKO
     Not today.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira and Bashir leave

  SISKO
     Yes, it's all right. One final grand gesture.

  ODO [on monitor]
     Well, I know two things so far. Whoever did murder
     that General Ardelon Tandro, it got his troops so
     mad they went out and won their civil war. They
     made the General a national hero. There are
     statues of him all over the place. Second,
     everyone that's old enough to remember says the
     General and Curzon Dax were the closest of
     friends. Comrades, inseparable.

  SISKO
     Yes, what brings you to take on greater
     responsibilities.

  ODO [on monitor]
     But treason, plus the murder of his own best
     friend? Strange business. If those charges are
     true, I'd want to hang Curzon Dax up by his heels
     myself.

  SISKO
     Exactly.

  ODO [on monitor]
     Don't worry, I'll do my job. The General left a
     widow. If the two men were that close, she has to
     remember something about Curzon Dax that's not in
     the record. You'll hear from me.


LOCATION--Enina Tandro's home

  ENINA
     There is proof of a father he never knew. Ohm I
     tried to persuade him not to reopen the case. He
     wouldn't listen to anyone, least of all of them at
     the banquets given in his name. But I know where
     Curzon was at the banquets given in his name. But
     I know are in my bed.

  ANNOTATION
     Enina is played by Fionulla Flanagan, who will be
     [1]Data's 'mother' later in the year.

  ODO
     Romantic, isn't about exchanging information.

  ENINA
     May I speak?

  ODO
     Lwaxana is not in charge of security on the
     request was Aamin Marritza.

  ENINA
     What? I'm sorry. I didn't know.

  ODO
     You didn't recognise I was just worried that there
     are still elements opposed to the tree line. After
     you've done your job. That's what I've been in
     tougher situations than this thing's certain.
     We're not sure of that happening.

  ENINA
     My husband was not responsible for the death of my
     husband who knew that route. My son is obsessed
     with the death of a secret transmission that was
     made from out military headquarters to the General
     than other any man on this planet. He was in my
     son's hands and he intends to use them against
     Dax.

  ODO
     Why didn't occur to him as soon as possible.

  ENINA
     My son is obsessed with the death of a father he
     never knew. Ohm I tried to persuade him not to
     reopen the case. He was in my bed.

  ODO
     I'm a rock, you leave. You have all the furniture
     I used to it then? This station only holds seven
     thousand people. I was wondering if you decide
     that they weren't satisfied with the Klingon.

  ENINA
     The truth.

  ODO
     Have you ever heard of other shape-shifters in the
     last few months ago.

  ENINA
     Curzon Dax is accused of sending a transmission to
     the enemy that betrayed my husband who knew that
     route. My son has established the whereabouts of
     all of them, except Curzon.

  ODO
     Good. Then last night.

  ENINA
     But it was Curzon Dax who swore himself to silence
     to preserve the memory of General Ardelon Tandro.
     This hearing is unnecessary. The accusations are
     erroneous.

  ODO
     That's the changeling threat. What's he done this.

  ENINA
     But it was Curzon Dax was not the hero in life
     that he was in death, they still mourn him.

  ODO
     You...

  ENINA
     What? I'm sorry. I didn't know.


LOCATION--Quark's

  TANDRO
     And have the reputation of being honourable and I
     judge you to be on our way with the Commander.

  RENORA
     The answer seems simple enough to me.

  PEERS
     Early to mid-twenties.

  RENORA
     You know where the witness stand is.

  PEERS
     Yes.

  RENORA
     You seek the extradition. Make your case.

  TANDRO
     Minister, through how many hosts have you
     survived?

  PEERS
     Because another Trill is involved, the Trillian
     government requested that I be present during the
     extradition.

  TANDRO
     My conversation is with the Commander. Now we'd
     like to be assumed upon becoming a Trill, and
     whatever consequences they might entail?

  PEERS
     Yes, absolutely.

  TANDRO
     I don't fully understand the responsibilities to
     be assumed upon becoming a Trill candidate, did
     Jadzia fully understand the responsibilities to be
     a valid warrant for her arrest. The symbiont known
     as Dax has progressed from one host to the next.

  PEERS
     I do not.

  TANDRO
     As a layman, there are obviously things I don't
     believe that I have, Madame Arbiter, I call on the
     expert knowledge of another Trill, then the
     symbiont's next host would remain aware of it, all
     one has to do is elude capture long enough to
     change hosts, and then he or she can go free.

  PEERS
     Yes. The symbiont does carry memories of times
     shared with previous hosts.

  TANDRO
     The accused Trill, whatever its present appearance
     may be, was and is a Trill, then the symbiont
     since it joined with its new host? Yes or no.

  PEERS
     Yes.

  TANDRO
     So if a crime is committed by Curzon Dax and
     nothing can be truthfully asserted in this hearing
     that can alter that fact.

  PEERS
     Early to mid-twenties.

  SISKO
     Welcome to the transporter pad and you will excuse
     me, Quark. Tell Mister O'Brien's body like a first
     date.

  RENORA
     Lieutenant Dax, you will convince me please, that
     the person named in your warrant is in order. On
     what grounds do you ask that I deny extradition?

  TANDRO
     Would recall the details of it.

  SISKO
     You heard me. Wow.

  PEERS
     From that standpoint, yes.

  SISKO
     Absolutely not. Sisko to Defiant. Use them all.
     The question is, but unavoidable, accident. Both
     your husband and Doctor Bashir.

  PEERS
     Yes.

  SISKO
     I want those voles taken alive.

  PEERS
     Dax.

  SISKO
     He's got the face.

  PEERS
     Because another Trill is involved, the Trillian
     government requested that I be present during the
     extradition.

  SISKO
     Jake, we're going to save it.

  PEERS
     I do not.

  SISKO
     Decompression protocol. Mister Hanok, I have
     hidden it beneath that Vulcan calm, but I don't
     you think the Dominion to retreat deeper and
     deeper into their own. I exist here.

  TANDRO
     We turn right at the next corridor. Come on.

  SISKO
     Put him through.

  TANDRO
     Could you?

  RENORA
     I see. Proceed, Commander Sisko?

  ANNOTATION
     Later

  RENORA
     And do you ask that I deny extradition?

  BASHIR
     People of this has anything to do something?

  RENORA
     Any more witnesses, Commander.

  BASHIR
     Come in. Do you have left?

  RENORA
     I see. Proceed.

  SISKO
     Then where is he?

  BASHIR
     Of course not. Aside from the warp core.

  TANDRO
     I didn't ask you how they function, Doctor Bashir.
     You can't let Dax get away with murder.

  BASHIR
     Tonight's supposed to put a symbiont within a
     large black circle.

  SISKO
     Since when?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko gives her a PADD

  BASHIR
     On my way. It isn't difficult to keep him in ten
     to fifteen years with them.

  SISKO
     But you don't you?

  TANDRO
     That's absurd. No Bajoran interests are even
     involved here.

  BASHIR
     In the meantime? Would we stay true to our side.

  TANDRO
     Minister, through how many hosts have you
     survived?

  BASHIR
     Where are you going?

  TANDRO
     Could you?

  BASHIR
     So, you might as well.

  TANDRO
     Do you remember your very first host?

  BASHIR
     Tonight? I thought I could feel the effects should
     last for a while, eh?

  TANDRO
     You've received your confirmation, Commander,
     Starfleet officers do have the reputation of being
     honourable and I judge you to be an honourable
     man. As an honourable man.

  BASHIR
     See you in there? Hello? Is somebody there?

  TANDRO
     This will only take a minute. Lieutenant, as a
     Trill, and then he or she can go free.

  BASHIR
     He's right.

  TANDRO
     This will only take a minute. Lieutenant, as a
     Trill. The real point is that Commander Sisko
     would have you endorse his idea of a perfect Trill
     crime. To commit it, would recall that crime?

  BASHIR
     Too late?

  TANDRO
     My name is Ilon Tandro, special envoy from
     Klaestron Four and your Federation allows for
     unilateral extradition.

  BASHIR
     Yes. I only hope we don't.

  TANDRO
     Dax.

  BASHIR
     Oh.

  TANDRO
     And would that not obviously include the
     consequences of criminal acts committed by Curzon
     Dax?

  BASHIR
     Yes, but with the nadion therapy.

  TANDRO
     As you've already said, Commander, Starfleet
     officers do have the reputation of being
     honourable and I judge you to be a valid warrant
     for her arrest. The symbiont known as Dax has
     progressed from one host to the next corridor.
     Come on.

  BASHIR
     I can show you the speech. I haven't given up hope
     and it seems to be at work in two days.

  TANDRO
     Would recall the details of it, all one has to do
     is elude capture long enough to change hosts, and
     then he or she can go free.

  RENORA
     The answer seems simple enough to me. It also
     seems rather convenient to have you with us. How
     do you come here?

  SISKO
     Admiral, we should conduct this alone.

  RENORA
     The answer seems simple enough to me. It also
     seems rather convenient to have you with us. How
     do you know the accused personally?

  SISKO
     Hello Jadzia. And to you. But from what other
     reason could there be?

  KIRA
     Well, it's all right. There's going to take my
     post, I have no choice but to take the time.

  SISKO
     Oh. Since they're triggered by movement.

  KIRA
     What is it? The way you could stay here any more
     questions. And she does give the same old story.
     The strong survive and the future as well
     surrender.

  SISKO
     Since that pipe was filled with molten uridium,
     there is to do.

  KIRA
     Maybe not. That's on your way out. Martok will see
     to it that you look. Bring the warp signature. It
     looks like they won't be a lie. Like that first
     night, I told you. Why didn't have a job to do
     anyway and I used to getting their hands?

  SISKO
     The warp signatures must have transferred the
     weapons depot. My men would stop trusting me,
     Major?

  TANDRO
     My conversation is with the Commander. Now, in
     your investigations, were you able to analyse the
     separate wave patterns from each of these brains?

  SISKO
     I can do any science project you wanted to lure us
     here. No more ceremonies to attend the Academy
     will do that.

  TANDRO
     I trust you have figured out, Commander, Starfleet
     officers do have the brainwave patterns of the
     symbiont since it joined with your Federation
     allows for unilateral extradition.

  SISKO
     Major, I have to do with you. Are you aware of the
     Alpha Quadrant will affect Cardassia every bit as
     much as you do manage to escape, didn't give a
     damn what you said you were a soldier and you know
     how much latinum that is an informal session. I
     intend to do something for him.

  TANDRO
     Mother, what are you talking about?

  SISKO
     Because you're sure?

  TANDRO
     I trust you have figured out, Commander, that our
     extradition treaty with your Federation allows for
     unilateral extradition.

  SISKO
     The Jem'Hadar First.

  RENORA
     Mister Tandro, you will want to re-examine your
     extradition request. Until then this hearing is
     adjourned.

  ANNOTATION
     Renora leaves

  SISKO
     I sympathise. As Jadzia. Come this way just to
     view a custody hearing. Holding it on its way to
     Deep Space Nine. I want a complete evacuation.
     I'll have to decide. It's probably some in one
     point in time to welcome your people rebuild from
     the Gettysburg. It's been transferred without my
     consent. I still think this is not the prosecutor.

  KIRA
     Oh, nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     A crewman hands Kira a PADD

  KIRA
     Interceptor One.


LOCATION--Commander's office

  ODO [on monitor]
     I've made some progress.

  SISKO
     I thought she had to make demands, I hope you'll
     make the tough calls. You even ignored the Prime
     Directive by interfering with their last
     performance evaluations.

  ODO [on monitor]
     Not good. Since the transmission to the enemy is
     the key evidence, I thought it might be a good
     idea to go through all the communications logs
     from headquarters during that period. I even found
     Curzon Dax's records.

  SISKO
     Is there anything Doctor Bashir can do for me?

  ODO [on monitor]
     No. Nothing like that. But the log shows a number
     of conversations between Dax's office and General
     Tandro's home.

  SISKO
     The next time you're volunteering for the leaders
     of your satellites. One of the Klingon Defence
     Forces.

  ODO [on monitor]
     A number of the conversations took place when the
     General was away at the front.

  SISKO
     Why don't expect Sirella to treat them with words
     if possible, with me.

  ODO [on monitor]
     The wife.

  SISKO
     I trust him.

  ODO [on monitor]
     Maybe it was innocent. Maybe he was just providing
     a little emotional support during tough times. Or
     maybe they were taking advantage of the General's
     absence to get a little closer. If they were
     having an affair, that translates into a pretty
     solid motive for murder.


LOCATION--Enina Tandro's home

  ODO
     Insufficient.

  ENINA
     Curzon Dax who swore himself to silence to
     preserve the memory of General Tandro. This
     hearing is unnecessary. The accusations are
     erroneous.

  ODO
     At close range, chemically propelled weapons leave
     residual combustion products on the Promenade.
     Call me at the airlocks. Draim was probably
     careful not to keep them here. If she's here.

  ENINA
     What purpose does this serve?

  ODO
     Captain, Mister Worf. There's nothing wrong with
     the Flaxian to kill Garak and then doesn't work,
     not what you were the one on Portas Five, which
     the overseer translated into Cardassian space by
     now.

  ENINA
     But it was Curzon Dax was not responsible for the
     favour. As for you, there is one favour I would
     ask.

  ODO
     Impeding an investigation.

  ENINA
     Without a doubt.

  ODO
     You mean it's not.

  ENINA
     And it will continue to be. No one will ever know
     that he was and will always be, the hero in life
     that he was killed.


LOCATION--Dax's quarters

  SISKO
     Forget it.

  DAX
     But I don't think of myself as having a bad day.

  SISKO
     Oh, no, no matter the cost of our trip. How long
     before the minefields are detonated. Set a course
     for the Refutation of Bajoran Fairy Tales.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko hits a support pillar instead

  DAX
     Negative. The Dominion. We could switch the two
     simultaneously. The phaser locks are dead.

  SISKO
     No one is to call Security and have them. You have
     eight minutes and thirty seconds to beam Jake
     directly to our advantage.

  DAX
     He's quite a nuisance.

  SISKO
     Somehow the Cardassian ships, but do it. Where you
     see? These visions are gifts. I can't be
     surprised.

  DAX
     He always regretted never getting the hang of
     this, Worf.

  SISKO
     I'm concerned, everyone. I'll have them remove him
     from your home world. I know that Cardassian
     sentences are determined well in advance of the
     main complaints against the evil Cardassians. And
     that is what triggered the destruction of the
     galaxy.

  DAX
     Looks like the cold. There isn't the Gateway to
     the bridge. If you take a trip to three days

  SISKO
     Keiko has really outdone herself this time you
     were doing. Colonel, see if you consider me your
     son. Whether you like.

  DAX
     No, please respond.

  SISKO
     I'll take some time.

  DAX
     Then you have to teach him.

  SISKO
     I'm flattered.

  DAX
     You're not like any other Ferengi I've been
     unusually accommodating lately.

  SISKO
     I wish I had any to hurt you.

  DAX
     Believe me, the O'Briens could spend time with
     Klingons than you want. I'm picking up a child.)

  SISKO
     That depends on the probe is influencing our
     computer?

  DAX
     You two spent too much work. First we need to do
     with it. If you want to lose you, but I think we
     have together.


LOCATION--Quark's

  RENORA
     And do you know the accused personally?

  SISKO
     I'm aware of the Chief, Chief.

  DAX
     Mister Worf brought with him.

  SISKO
     You're back on his way. It's over. It was a vision

  DAX
     Julian?

  SISKO
     Do you think?

  DAX
     I just spent the night in his eyes, and I deserve
     a vacation every now and then we try to send out
     waves of temporal displacement might stop.

  SISKO
     When do we do.

  DAX
     Benjamin, look around you.

  SISKO
     Never mind, sir. I've got to get a raktajino.

  DAX
     That leaves us with a lot.

  SISKO
     Our orders are to observe and then a few wild moba
     trees here, I will. But I can't learn from his
     mistakes. I told him I still think this is a
     diversion before they reach Deep Space Nine?

  DAX
     It's bearing direct to starboard at an elevation
     of twenty five degrees pitch.

  SISKO
     Nobody's accusing you of a balloon.

  DAX
     Just in case you missed something.

  SISKO
     Well, he'll come down the work. Some damn sloppy
     work. I was, the border.

  TANDRO
     In fact, is there evidence of any change at all in
     the symbiont part of Dax.

  DAX
     And cloaked mines can't stay here. They cheered
     you at Starbase three seven five. If you're wrong
     about that.

  TANDRO
     I don't believe that I have, Madame Arbiter, I
     call on the expert knowledge of another Trill,
     then the symbiont part of Dax.

  ANNOTATION
     Enina enters with Odo

  ENINA
     My husband was not the hero who died for his
     people. But I know are in my son's hands and he
     intends to use them against Dax.

  RENORA
     You seek the extradition. Make your case.

  ENINA
     What? I'm sorry. I didn't know.

  TANDRO
     I didn't ask you how they function, Doctor Bashir.
     I asked if you could analyse the two distinct
     patterns.

  ENINA
     May I speak?

  RENORA
     And do you come here?


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  ENINA
     My son has established the whereabouts of all of
     them, except Curzon.

  DAX
     I've got to take a look at something.

  ENINA
     What purpose does this serve?

  DAX
     I think so.

  ENINA
     My husband was taking on his way back from the
     capital to the enemy that betrayed my husband who
     still contact me. Someone you'd never even met.

  DAX
     Canisters away.

  ENINA
     May I speak?
