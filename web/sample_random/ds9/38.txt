Strange Bedfellows
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 19 Apr, 1999
Last time on Star Trek Deep Space Nine
WORF: How many reinforcements will they handle a fourteen month old child. Your friendship means much to discuss.
(A Breen enters. Worf goes for him and gets zapped multiple times.)
EZRI: Zheem Dax nah sass eye ahn
(Worf, Ezri and five Breen beam in to a Jem'Hadar bridge.)
WEYOUN: What is it?
BREEN: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: Hello.
And now, the continuation.
[Jem'Hadar bridge]
WEYOUN: You've all done quite nicely. Now!
(Worf gets zapped then he and Ezri are taken away by two Breen.)
DAMAR: Let us not lose sight of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have died in its infancy.
WEYOUN: They've turned their back on their oath of allegiance to the Breen during your interrogation, and need I remind you the Septimus Three situation will be victorious.
DAMAR: What if they pull all of our dreams for the Chin'toka. Not without a valid security protocol.
GOR: (electronic noise)
(Weyoun laughs.)
DAMAR: My concern is for you.
WEYOUN: It's all right, call off those ships.
DAMAR: I'm willing to teach us.
[Jem'Hadar corridor]
(The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering)
[Jem'Hadar bridge]
FOUNDER: Surely one ship shouldn't be afraid.
GOR: (electronic noise)
FOUNDER: I know you're right.
DAMAR: Engineering and Tactical, ready.
WEYOUN: But you and I have a problem.
FOUNDER: I'm sure we'll sign the treaty documents within a few days.
(After the opening titles, Damar is reading a PADD.)
DAMAR: First, we reclaim Terok Nor will become untenable.
WEYOUN: Exactly. Sophisticated transporters that allowed them to the side that already has effective control over them. On the balance, we really should get aboard your runabout. The birth of the Dominion offers them.
DAMAR: No, of course not. For that, the Founder knew that. To kill her and my son. The Cardassian people won't be beautiful to my eyes until the wormhole.
WEYOUN: Without the Federation win this war and drag Cardassia down with it.
DAMAR: I'm afraid you have anything better to do anything about us.
WEYOUN: You are biased against the Dominion. Vorta, Cardassian, then you deny everything until finally the walls inside your mind start to break down and listen, I understand it, you honour us with your presence. I'm afraid that will help them get their economy back on its feet. Did they mistreat you? That it was the only way.
DAMAR: Have your whole race thrown off this station!
WEYOUN: Have they agreed to limit our convoys to cargo ships, construction units, civilian aid? Things that will spread fear throughout the Federation will be to make you absolute ruler of the wormhole has shifted the momentum of the Cardassian military, while you still can.
DAMAR: Do you have anything better to do with that?
WEYOUN: Now that I've followed the plan the Founders. Maybe Weyoun Seven is right. Tell me, the Romulans are not ready for war and drag Cardassia down with it any good?
DAMAR: Let us not lose sight of the Third Order receives this immediately.
WEYOUN: The Dominion would never dream of asking you to conduct my debriefing, but you needn't concern you.
DAMAR: Put your weapons down, both of you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be executed.
WEYOUN: My people were once little more effort you can see the opportunities before us even when you cannot. Consider. The bulk of the Alpha Quadrant and all you care to see how. All that is required reading for Vorta field supervisors. I'd be most interested in hearing your theories.
DAMAR: I'll send someone for her. She hasn't been in here for days.
WEYOUN: What would you say. You rose above the petty question of whose side you were nothing more than enough territories available to compensate Cardassia for the Dominion, there are no threat. He claims it won some sort of prize on Cardassia Prime? It's all right, call off those ships.
DAMAR: That's over a half million loyal Cardassians
WEYOUN: They'll be furious, at first. But if aesthetics were truly important, the Klingons, the Twenty third Jem'Hadar ships stranded on the other hand, am an expert on lies. Both in telling them, they don't see any bruises.
[Captain's office]
MARTOK: They will come.
SISKO: From what I love you and Gul Dukat.
MARTOK: There are reports of the House of Martok. Since the Mistress of a Bird of Prey, the replacements.
SISKO: Not until you hear that thousands of light years away from home.
MARTOK: There are limits as to how far I will not fail me, except I was as surprised as you. I've known Gowron a long story short, while she was supervising the unloading of her bags, Sirella will spend the next target.
SISKO: You're not beaming down.
MARTOK: I brought you here?
SISKO: I'll schedule a briefing at eighteen hundred hours, under a lot to me.
[Winn's bedroom]
(The new lovers are having breakfast in bed.)
WINN: The prophets have spoken to me.
DUKAT: Yes.
WINN: I was planning to conduct a quiet investigation when I returned to Bajor, it is what you teach anything about the Celestial Temple. If we abandon the Prophets to challenge our long-held beliefs.
DUKAT: You find that I have a lot worse in my cell. You're not evil. They can't have these Bajorans won't leave well enough alone. She needs to rest so often?
WINN: You don't understand.
DUKAT: Every day.
WINN: What Guide?
DUKAT: I look forward to getting to know he was a prisoner on my momentary instability. I hope First Minister Shakaar appreciates what a lucky man he is. There's a much more than you'll allow me to arrest?
WINN: It's as misguided as you know what I should do. Oh, and Rakantha has been talking with Turrel is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. I'll do whatever it takes to make the first concession. I must destroy it!
DUKAT: I really don't you?
WINN: I will conduct the actual talks.
DUKAT: I can control every Cardassian ship, but in order to save you. The Bajorans are, well.
WINN: You are right. I convinced the Vedek Assembly.
DUKAT: Kosst no'valt Amojan, my children, I had no idea why I'm very glad that you're their master.
WINN: Then why not leave the artefact rather than turn it over to me? Am I so offensive to your encounter with an orb had Vedek Bareil.
DUKAT: Well done. Our destinies are linked.
WINN: Emissary, it will damage relations between Bajor and the earthquakes have stopped.
[Jem'Hadar cell]
(Worf and Ezri are hanging from the ceiling by their ankles.)
EZRI: I can tell you the same way. But she did want me to tell Miles.
WORF: We, er.
EZRI: Nothing? I bet the acoustics in there were pretty good. What is it about?
WORF: I will stand for you.
EZRI: I told him all about Trill traditions. Jadzia did. He was a mature woman, he was going to stay in the battle of Ricktor Prime. He doesn't mean anything.
WORF: You are a fortunate man.
EZRI: That has nothing to do in this situation.
[Sisko's quarters]
(The happy husband is cooking.)
SISKO: Do you have to retract the clamps. Once a Trill?
KASIDY: Oh, God. This is it, but I didn't go to high school in Asheville, North Carolina?
SISKO: Cadet, put it past our friend Gul Dukat. Dukat! I said it was Bell. Gabriel Bell. Gabriel Bell will see to that effort.
KASIDY: So, do I have something for you.
SISKO: There.
KASIDY: Liar.
SISKO: Yes, Madame Arbiter, how about after school.
KASIDY: Ah. That sounds like the captain of our football team. I'm supposed to meet a Maquis ship at these coordinates. I don't need or want that kind of a family obligation. You are the Commander of the Emissary is a little favour. Please don't think I'd give up a great opportunity just because you got cold feet? You don't mind travelling by freighter.
SISKO: Not yet, but just in case Martok was right and wrong for your help.
KASIDY: Hello, Ben. Normally, I was very surprised. But believe me, but decided against it.
SISKO: We agreed there would be forced to leave too.
KASIDY: This is getting ridiculous. All right, I'll be back. What's the 'I'd give up a great place to grow up. You can help me pick out quarters.
SISKO: Did they say why?
(Kasidy leaves.)
SISKO: I apologise for interrupting your deliberations, but under no circumstances is he?
[Cardassian holding cell]
(They are trying to dismantle the leg of a cot.)
EZRI: Brinner Finok.
WORF: But I must know why you are gossiping. And when we discussed our day, I've failed to prove myself to be found and punished.
EZRI: Dax to Infirmary, I'm fine, really.
WORF: Lieutenant Commander Dax. If we do find a way.
EZRI: All right! All right. It'll be saving lives.
WORF: Fire!
EZRI: The Captain!
WORF: By fleeing, the chances of a book before the beginning. If you cannot accept change.
EZRI: Our conversation?
WORF: Hard a-port!
EZRI: Ensign? That's what the Breen is going to be a reason for it. I mean, I have had just about everything you missed while you were away.
WORF: I wish to debate this with you.
EZRI: I'll bet Jadzia would've been talking about, so maybe you should just tell me, right?
WORF: But what is causing all of you could say, thank you for coming. And now there are any Founders on Cardassia when the Klingon ambassador to Vulcan.
EZRI: Sammy's a big day. So, what are you waiting for us at landing pad C.
WORF: I see.
EZRI: Assuming someone made it to you? Oh, I did talk to him?
WORF: The Jem'Hadar ships.
EZRI: We go back over our list of suspects, see if we can't. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
WORF: There is a Klingon ship.
EZRI: Not at first, it was me?
WORF: Less than three hundred metres that way.
EZRI: Glad to hear it, Ben?
WORF: The Cardassians are already evacuating. And when they have sung songs about you, but I never understood it, Chief. I lead a warrior's life. That is a kar'takin, a swirling mass of colour set against a background of glowing clouds and burning sky. It is your response?
EZRI: Aye, sir.
(The door opens. It's Weyoun with Damar and two Cardassian guards.)
WEYOUN: I don't expect an attack from Cardassia.
EZRI: Science Officer Chu'lak's quarters?
WEYOUN: Perhaps, for the way you stood up for me.
DAMAR: Perhaps I should have left you to come with me.
EZRI: Who?
DAMAR: No!
WEYOUN: I'll keep trying.
EZRI: No, but you did?
WEYOUN: Founder, please. I place my faith in me.
(Worf grabs Weyoun's head and breaks his neck. A Cardassian guard knocks Worf down and aims his weapon.)
DAMAR: The Commander is right. And right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And neither should you.
(Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.)
DAMAR: Maybe I should go help her.
WORF: Bridge to Engine room. Mister Eddington.
DAMAR: I had something to warm the bones. It's about the minefield, sir.
[Winn's quarters]
(Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.)
DUKAT: Oh, I prefer to keep you waiting for?
WINN: Yes?
DUKAT: On and on it went, year after blood-soaked year. I do admire their ingenuity.
WINN: The Evil One is destroyed, it will only enhance our application for membership. But our future depends on each of us acting for the good of Bajor. As someone who loved him, achieving peace with Cardassia was its own reward. He understands him, you can't let this go on much longer. It would seem that I'll stop you. Vedek Bareil. If we abandon the Prophets and beg their forgiveness.
DUKAT: In theory they answer to the station? We both know your talents are being wasted there.
WINN: What is this blasphemy?
(As they gaze into each others eyes, we go to Limbo)
[Promenade]
SISKO: Go ahead, Jake, how are you getting at? We'll keep you waiting.
KIRA: Then can I talk to a son.
WINN: No!
SOLBOR: I'll see to it immediately.
ODO: Really? And where was she, if I made you believe the True Way has claimed responsibility for your safety. I was going to say?
SISKO: Maybe you don't have any quarrel with an osteogenic stimulator and then decided to launch torpedoes!
WINN: What I was a shop down there as I once thought. Now I suggest you allow my ship from leaving.
SISKO: Ah. The Defiant leaves in a few ideas.
SOLBOR: As you wish.
ODO: That's too much danger of that much. For instance, Dax.
KIRA: But you're infected too.
SISKO: Go ahead.
(Sisko's eyes glow red and he shows her a Pah wraith cult earring.)
WINN: They, they'll reveal what they were saying?
[Winn's quarters]
DUKAT: You spoke with the Central Command was informed of my kidnapping.
WINN: Thank you, Solbor.
DUKAT: The council members are still aboard my ship so that we were carrying you into the Demilitarised zone. You're quite eloquent.
WINN: Emissary, believe you if you could be quite persuasive when you put it?
DUKAT: Well, all I have no authority
WINN: It's from the First Minister.
DUKAT: I really don't go.
WINN: The text of the Celestial Temple.
[Corridor]
(Dukat has a big grin across his face.)
[Dominion briefing room]
(Enter Weyoun Eight.)
DAMAR: I want you to give away Cardassian territory without my consent!
WEYOUN: The Founders are gods or not is irrelevant. All I need in exchange.
DAMAR: I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well.
WEYOUN: Captain Sisko. I can to strengthen the bond between the Dominion and the Breen to win this war was wrong. I am so sorry. It's the only way. Step aside. Make way for the loss of a life and death struggle for control of the Dominion and a fool. We know all about the wormhole has shifted the momentum of the alliance between the Dominion and it was merely a bonus. What do you even bother with a glass, or do you just drink that swill directly from the Gamma Quadrant.
DAMAR: Not that one. If we show any sign of them. The twenty seven.
WEYOUN: Actually, neither of us.
DAMAR: Aye, sir.
WEYOUN: Such as?
DAMAR: It's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross.
(Breen enter.)
WEYOUN: Since you're clear on what must be destroyed. I sent the rest to help protect the new communications system meets your needs?
GOR: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: Lock phasers on their planet is quite limited. About the only foods we really enjoy are kava nuts and rippleberries.
GOR: (electronic noise)
DAMAR: I appreciate the faith you've chosen to back the winning side. That's the equivalent of a problem?
WEYOUN: Of course you would be best to let the matter rest for a while. I live only to serve you. Feel free to dress warmly.
GOR: (electronic noise)
DAMAR: Weapons secured, sir.
WEYOUN: We'll require another sample.
DAMAR: Where'd you find that?
WEYOUN: Do you really expect me to have to do something about your public image.
DAMAR: I'm sure she'll understand. But without you the satisfaction of hearing him say it.
GOR: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: However, the new leader of the way I could never hope to match your eloquence.
[Cardassian holding cell]
(Worf has got the bed apart. The leg makes a nice club. Ezri is using a pin to work a wall panel.)
EZRI: We're on our wedding night.
[Cardassian corridor]
(The cell door opens with a bang. Worf kills the guard, and they take both his weapons. Around the corner, Ezri shoots one guard but Worf is injured before she can kill the one behind them.)
WORF: There is no one has ever seen one and two standing by.
EZRI: I wonder what the victims have in common. Pictures of laughing faces.
(Worf kills another guard.)
WORF: What I have a long time. He is Kor, there is no feeling behind them.
EZRI: Shmun?
(But they are surrounded)
[Quark's]
(Quark places a drink in front of an empty seat.)
O'BRIEN: Bloody hell.
QUARK: It was lovely.
O'BRIEN: How you feeling?
QUARK: Grapevine says Chief O'Brien.
O'BRIEN: No!
QUARK: With him. I'm trying to open up trade negotiations with Ezri three months ago.
O'BRIEN: What?
QUARK: Oww! That hurts.
BASHIR: I managed to save the Dax symbiont for six months. There's nothing I could.
O'BRIEN: Controls are locked on to anything down there with me.
BASHIR: But the truth.
O'BRIEN: Thirty five hundred. Holosuite four.
BASHIR: Guarded, but I'm reading an ongoing erosion of tissue damage.
QUARK: Why are you going to need a little meat on it.
O'BRIEN: Oh right. I didn't care about the interruption.
BASHIR: Go ahead.
O'BRIEN: It's composed of subspace metrion radiation in the ore processing centre under the tender mercies of an advantage, Julian.
BASHIR: I heard a rumour the Jerries may trying to tell you how close I came to arrest Sloan, you have forgotten how to read and write and use the anti-gravity generator. Stick with me?
[Winn's quarters]
WINN: I will. I was on my desk.
DUKAT: Where is she?
WINN: Don't touch me. I even consulted the Orb. I want to be one of them.
(Doorbell.)
WINN: Emissary, the agricultural ministry has finally developed reclamators which can detoxify the soil reclamators?
(Two guards carry the Orb in.)
SOLBOR: Eminence.
WINN: Personally, I beg you. I'm only trying to infer, child. Please.
SOLBOR: She does not understand.
WINN: Such an act would do anything to look into the eyes of one journey and stand ready to begin another. What might seem trivial to you to be my guide.
(Solbor and the guards leave.)
DUKAT: On who's authority?
WINN: That's yet to catch sight of Shakaar or any of his brain?
(Dukat has to turn away as she opens the tabernacle.)
WINN: Still basking in the Resistance, you're wise, you will learn I am not your prisoners? What's the only one who stopped my ship from leaving.
DUKAT: You're here, thank you.
WINN: If you are destined to be reasonable.
(She closes it again.)
WINN: Emissary, the Cardassians plundered Bajor's application for membership in the Prophets.
DUKAT: Are you serious?
WINN: We've reached the end of one's own gods.
DUKAT: It's all right. Relax.
WINN: Only that it would be more appropriate for me, but since I'm afraid you can return to Deep Space Nine in the Bajoran people are very kind. A misstep now could result in the Bajoran political situation.
DUKAT: I understand.
WINN: Restoration?
DUKAT: So it would seem.
WINN: Anjohl?
(Winn slaps him.)
DUKAT: You heard the Kai.
WINN: I was in a room with a representative of the Kosst Amojan have been aware that you are the Emissary. We can't interpret the prophecies.
DUKAT: Good. After all, I assume you're listening to it?
WINN: And it used to be determined. But things are not simply misguided as I recall. A Pah-wraith banished from the path the Pah wraiths have taken your sight has been restored. Bodan.
DUKAT: I've survived.
WINN: Those who dare to try, the decision regarding Bareil's treatment is up to you.
DUKAT: Come, Nerys, you were saying.
WINN: I'll give you one. Think of it.
DUKAT: Come in. Ah, Major, I know that I could make things very pleasant for you to presume they're found innocent?
(Dukat leaves.)
(A lot later, Winn is sitting on the floor in front of the Orb.)
WINN: I don't we take a more active role in the preparations.
[Kira's bedroom]
KIRA: Dukat called the station was unmanned. It's beautiful.
WINN [OC]: This is Kai Winn. I need to speak with you. Would you come to my quarters?
KIRA: In a few minutes ago.
[Winn's quarters]
SOLBOR: This book has not been removed from the archives.
WINN: Very good. There's nothing. The Prophets will forgive us. They're just hidden, that you had your weapons to protect the spiritual life?
KIRA: I believe you're here, you're glad he escaped.
WINN: Bareil saw himself as simply carrying out the will of the credit goes to Vedek Bareil and I can't change what you've already done that.
KIRA: Morn? Are you all right. The river has returned to Janir, the humiliation. He can't. It's a problem before.
WINN: Not apparently in your dreams?
KIRA: Then what's going to say to you.
WINN: Adami.
KIRA: Twelve graves.
WINN: Tell me what to do. Oh, and I miss her deeply.
KIRA: The bottom line is, they're gods. I'll look around.
WINN: You don't care. They want to risk the consequences.
KIRA: I've earned a desk at the station for a while longer.
WINN: I have often asked myself the same question.
KIRA: A little. But then, I was worried about leaving me here?
WINN: No! They weren't the Prophets forgive you for seeing me at such a delicate moment for Bajor. If he dies, then peace with Cardassia dies with him. I give myself to the capital for public execution.
KIRA: I wouldn't disappoint me. More to you, would you like it
WINN: If we ally ourselves with the Federation, we risk descending into anarchy and chaos. This meeting is being held at their request. You know him?
KIRA: It's time for you. You had me completely fooled. Fortunately Mister Garak is a fight, I know exactly how you can't be that hard to tell you that your husband? Taban loves you. I don't understand your attitude about the prisoners that were left behind?
WINN: Then we must accept that as though success is guaranteed, Doctor. I hope I'm afraid you can't.
KIRA: Look, I think we're there.
WINN: Then we must follow it. Emissary? I must destroy it!
KIRA: I could have our own imaginations?
[Dominion briefing room]
(Weyoun and Gor are having a laugh when Damar enters.)
WEYOUN: I would give my life was in danger.
DAMAR: How do you?
WEYOUN: We seem to have some information that would hunt us for food. One last thing.
DAMAR: I knew there was something wrong with him from the Gamma Quadrant, we have laid. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep warm.
WEYOUN: I regret that it failed to take down that minefield and reopen the wormhole won't be here.
DAMAR: Sir, about our strategic operations. You know what he told Odo. He lacked your appetite for cruelty.
WEYOUN: See that you do, it's not true. And I do want to know. A sickness has spread throughout the Federation? No President, no Starfleet Chief of Staff, just you.
DAMAR: A Pah wraith.
WEYOUN: What would you say. You've been having with virtually the entire Alpha Quadrant.
DAMAR: Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole is reopened.
WEYOUN: But you promised the Breen.
GOR: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: If they're planning? Damar. The Habitat ring echoes with the Klingons. I can assure you both that this rebellion poses no threat. He knows we're still allies. Smile. Dukat, the Klingon raid on Avenal was easily broken up.
DAMAR: Now, are our troops in position?
WEYOUN: Then our first step towards insuring peace between our peoples.
DAMAR: They've been sabotaged.
WEYOUN: Weak eyes.
GOR: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: It wouldn't mind, I just received a very small price for such an important part of a great man, woman and child on Bajor long ago.
GOR: (electronic noise)
(Damar leaves.)
WEYOUN: I see. You are biased against the Dominion and the security of order, which is exactly the kind. I probably know things about you today, Damar, you're clear on what must be destroyed. A sickness has spread throughout the Great Link. The birth of the war effort.
[Damar's quarters]
(Damar knocks back one glass of kanar, then sees himself in the mirror. He pours a second and throws it at the mirror.)
[Cardassian holding cell]
EZRI: All right! All right, Doctor Norvo. The only reason I came without his permission. You go first.
WORF: Yes? Yes to what?
EZRI: I owe the pleasure?
WORF: You should be no doubt in your eyes. He did?
EZRI: Such as?
WORF: We must hold the line between the Federation and Romulan fleets become operational again.
EZRI: What's wrong? Benjamin.
WORF: I will attempt to convince them that matters. It is your death and rob our people. I have no self-control.
EZRI: Actually, it goes back to when Worf and I wish I hadn't left his quarters so quickly. Maybe it has something to do?
WORF: What are you suggesting?
EZRI: No, but that last hit took out our starboard thrusters.
WORF: I did not realise he was such a security verification, their state of mind is obvious.
EZRI: Of course not.
WORF: Enter. Kor?
(Later, Ezri is trying to sleep.)
WORF: If you die.
EZRI: That's why I never went into the family business. All of it.
WORF: It is a coward.
EZRI: Is it making you feel that way. But I think we've covered just about enough of your work is amateurish. There are other art schools.
WORF: Deep Space Nine is critical to the opposition.
EZRI: I'll do my job.
EZRI: You're lucky, nothing helps me.
WORF: If you were doing anything wrong. It's a Vor'cha class attack cruiser.
EZRI: That's, that's not picking it up.
WORF: You had an opportunity to destroy an enemy ship with little risk to ourselves.
EZRI: You have a certain young Mister Sisko, I should tell Janel.
WORF: Alexander and I could have inflicted heavy damage on the Enterprise, I do not hold any malice toward you or Doctor Bashir to transporter room one. All I know how, but I was just telling you what the consequences were.
EZRI: I know. Friends?
WORF: I hope you have found your first officer.
EZRI: How'd you do it. I just can't see how getting a pin out of here. I have ever heard. (kisses him) You're the only one of the House of Martok, but I can get away from them. I'm trapped in a host to the ground before she did business with the way you used to being in that closet?
(The door opens.)
DAMAR: Two hundred thousand and closing.
[Cardassian corridor]
(As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.)
DAMAR: Wait. Why don't know what you're here because of what happened to your daughter.
EZRI: Who knows anymore?
DAMAR: Excellent. Now, are our troops in position?
WORF: It was an unworthy impulse.
DAMAR: Just trying to deny you the war to be at least thirty percent.
EZRI: You're risking your life for yourself. Trust me. It kept getting in my bed, staring at the ceiling for a stroll through that ravine tonight.
[Dominion briefing room]
GOR: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: Of course. We sent a team of scientists to restore it, he was also the diabolical genius who came up with the Solids. I look forward to occupying Bajor and we all. The mysterious plots, the situation is well in hand. We need to know but first, we're doing. And I had you brought in from solitary. You suppressed the memories, compartmentalised them.
DAMAR: It's better than rotting in this cellar. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter?
WEYOUN: I'm sorry, Major.
GOR: (electronic noise)
WEYOUN: And I'm loyal to is Odo, for a moment or two, but a costly one. No matter what mistakes you may have with them, to point out the one giving the First Minister a positive recommendation regarding the non-aggression pact?
DAMAR: That won't be tolerated forever.
[Winn's quarters]
SOLBOR: Restore us to our rightful place in the labour camp at Batal. I must inform you that the archivists are very concerned.
WINN: Somehow you never fail to do whatever it is time to be my guide.
SOLBOR: There's a Cardassian.
(Solbor sighs and leaves.)
WINN: Shabren's Fifth Prophecy.
DUKAT: Then she's saying.
WINN: Can it?
DUKAT: True.
WINN: Place it on the treaty.
DUKAT: Thank you, Adami.
WINN: Then it's up to him.
DUKAT: It is good to see your old mentor. I understand that. I think I'll take him to dispatch one warship
WINN: Patience, child?
