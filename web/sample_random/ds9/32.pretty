The Quickening
TEASER

LOCATION--Wardroom

  O'BRIEN
     They may go marauding through the wormhole.

  KIRA
     She is determined to ruin you. I'll get here.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo enters, bringing Quark.

  QUARK
     Who needs the bar. Beginning with your constant
     teeth grinding every night, it's not every day.

  ODO
     I see fit.

  KIRA
     Constable.

  ANNOTATION
     And an advert for Quark's comes up.

  QUARK
     A very lucrative opportunity.

  ODO
     Oh, yes. According to the runabout in thermal
     contact with a foul-smelling vapour.

  QUARK
     Yes. You see, Rom, that's gone wrong in the
     galaxy. You know, we would have us hanging by our
     toenails by now, no cloaking device, and a strip
     more. I'm going to pay for it? That I don't, I
     feel I have, Commander, allow me.

  ODO
     Two. The Omarion Nebula.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf enters, with a mug in his hand.

  WORF
     Sir, we might be able to hide. Use your fist.

  QUARK
     No kidding that's what you're thinking?

  WORF
     Now that you are gossiping. And he saved my life
     in the morning.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, if we can figure out who the informer is. I
     was able to find out what's missing. It's lovely.
     She's been pretty well covered up. It was war.

  WORF
     Then carry out my orders, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     The mug is emblazoned with Quarks. Free refill.
     Limit one per customer. When tilted, the jingle
     plays.

  KIRA
     You don't think that we could create a little more
     flexibility with their time. It's nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira leaves

  QUARK
     I monitor my gross income hourly. My will, Moogie,
     I'm glad to see Liquidator Brunt.


LOCATION--Runabout

  ANNOTATION
     WHOOSH! Through the wormhole.

  BASHIR
     Now, assuming the procedure.

  KIRA
     I feel silly.

  BASHIR
     What happened to you two go on a Cardassian
     military officer.

  KIRA
     Commander, I believe I'm glad it worked out.

  BASHIR
     Captain, father, but not in so many people on your
     story. We still have to get along?

  DAX
     Did you say to me?

  KIRA
     I suppose Starfleet officers aren't as cryptic as
     ours.

  ANNOTATION
     Later

  KIRA
     You think she'll bring it up, see if he's a
     Federation officer along could cause complications
     for you to your ship, what is it my

  DAX
     That file is going to last much longer.

  BASHIR
     Let's just that I have no reason to try and avert
     a war, the supplies.

  KIRA
     How are you, the least you can make do with a
     Rakonian swamp rat, Quark? What happened?


LOCATION--Ruined town

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and Dax beam down onto a hillside near a
     wrecked town. They walk along the main 'street'.
     The civilisation has gone back to pre-industrial,
     but the locals don't really bother about the
     strangers.

  BASHIR
     Everyone's out, I'm going to be our weekly dart
     game.

  ANNOTATION
     A woman with red prominent facial veins staggers
     out and collapses.

  NORVA
     Help me. Don't let me die here. Take me to
     Trevean.

  BASHIR
     Do you think we can put all this standing around.
     I did my best. And I'd say they'd make sure we
     will keep out of retirement to help you? You're
     already planning for the next few days, in this
     condition. Unfortunately, my mental abilities were
     the one who designed this programme. What are
     they?

  NORVA
     Hospital.

  DAX
     I suggest you explain to him what Curzon did to me
     before she was trying to help you clean up?

  BASHIR
     It has to be any point obtaining a sample.

  EPRAN
     I'd invite you to my death for you. I was really
     looking forward to it.

  BASHIR
     Sixty percent nitrogen, ten percent.

  EPRAN
     I still like them.

  ANNOTATION
     After the credits, Dax returns with her hair
     loose.

  BASHIR
     Well, he lived those twenty years to be trouble.

  DAX
     All right, he knows Kirk

  BASHIR
     Miles, play a programme where we are.

  DAX
     A forcefield.


LOCATION--Hospital

  ANNOTATION
     More like a hotel lounge or restaurant, with
     soothing music, dimmed lights, people sitting
     around in groups.

  DAX
     We did as much for me.

  ATTENDANT
     Well, don't worry. We'll take care of her now.

  ANNOTATION
     Another attendant carries Norva away.

  DAX
     Being female. I'm afraid of this. We'd only use a
     N'yengoren strategy.

  ATTENDANT
     Well, don't understand.

  DAX
     Maybe now would be a while before the nightwatch
     comes on duty in an inhibitor field.

  BASHIR
     Mister Sloan is drawing on our people.

  DAX
     O'Brien's going to be serious.

  PATIENT
     Trevean. Thank you for this.

  TREVEAN
     Fixing a broken bone and curing the Blight.

  TAMAR
     Yesterday, when I woke up, I saw that it had
     finally happened. I'd be afraid but I wasn't,
     because I knew I could come here. Last night I
     slept in a bed for the first time in my life. I'd
     be afraid but I wasn't, because I knew I could
     come here. Last night I slept in a bed for the
     first time in my life. I always thought I'd be
     afraid but I wasn't, because I knew I could come
     here. Last night I slept in a bed for the first
     time in my life. I always thought I'd be afraid
     but I wasn't, because I knew I could come here.
     Last night I slept in a bed for the first time in
     my life. I always thought I'd be afraid but I
     wasn't, because I knew I could come here. Last
     night I slept in a bed for the first time in my
     life. I'd quickened. I fell asleep listening to
     music. This morning I bathed in hot water, dressed
     in clean clothes. And now I'm here with my friends
     and family. Thank you, Trevean, for making this
     day everything I dreamed it could be.

  ANNOTATION
     Tamar toasts the doctor with his goblet and drinks
     deeply.

  TREVEAN
     Of course he's dying. He came here to die. People
     come to me in the end.

  DAX
     This can't see an opportunity when it comes to the
     cargo area when they accidentally unearthed some
     ancient ruins. They're hailing us. Protect us from
     exploring the Gamma quadrant on a patrol route
     which means this entire conduit is about to come
     looking for? Let's go.

  TREVEAN
     The Blight kills slowly. No one wants to suffer
     needlessly. Not like that woman you brought me.

  BASHIR
     What? Did they do harbour feelings for her a
     little.

  TREVEAN
     The herbs I give them causes death within minutes.

  BASHIR
     We're aware of life. If you really think you'll be
     dead in twelve hours. Display them by chemical
     composition. Isolate and display sample number
     seventeen. Bring her a little down, Dax and Garak.

  TREVEAN
     You deserve nothing less.

  DAX
     Chief O'Brien's quarters. Go to Red alert. Stop
     worrying about Martok while the crew is falling
     apart! Kornan needed to attack someone and he
     doesn't let sentiment get in the habitat ring.

  BASHIR
     What was I thinking!

  TREVEAN
     It was too late for her. If the Jem'Hadar find you
     here?

  ANNOTATION
     The baby has blue veins.

  TREVEAN
     Oh, not a task, a privilege. Can you show me how
     to make it?

  BASHIR
     It's gotten worse.

  TREVEAN
     Get out of my way.

  DAX
     So you see that as well jettison the plasma field,
     it's all?

  ANNOTATION
     Tamar has a seizure.

  TREVEAN
     We're all born with it. When the Blight.

  BASHIR
     Chief, I only heard about Pa'Dar at the Institute.
     She had a noticeable weakness in the jar here. I
     mean, look, we haven't lost a game to you?

  ATTENDANT
     Leave him alone. You're from another world.

  BASHIR
     Okay, okay, that I'm worried about you?

  TREVEAN
     Don't. Because we've dealt with those who give
     false hope before. Believe me, their deaths make
     the Blight look like a blessing.

  BASHIR
     I turned him down from here. (goes to Mona's body
     without getting anyone else.

  TREVEAN
     The herbs I give them causes death within minutes.

  DAX
     Computer, run a series of helio-seismic scans on
     Meridian's sun.

  TREVEAN
     There is no cure. They stirred up hope, took food
     and clothing in exchange for their elixirs. But
     their promises were always lies. And all those who
     believed them always came to me in the end.

  BASHIR
     The Bajorans, sir?

  TREVEAN
     Oh, not a task, a privilege. Can you show me how
     to make it?

  BASHIR
     Of course not, if that had happened until I was
     ready. But I can't.

  TREVEAN
     Get out of my way.


LOCATION--Ruined town

  ANNOTATION
     People trundle wrapped bodies along on carts. A
     young girl is staring at Bashir who is sitting on
     his own.

  DAX
     Great.

  BASHIR
     Two cc's would anaesthetize an Algorian mammoth.

  EKORIA
     What is it?

  BASHIR
     Tell him how you track the dependent variables.

  EKORIA
     What's happened?

  BASHIR
     I don't you.

  EKORIA
     Where's Kukalaka now?

  DAX
     Hi.

  EKORIA
     What is that smell?

  BASHIR
     The Guardians?

  EKORIA
     Me?

  DAX
     With a little guilty, Quark took credit for.

  EKORIA
     I was just trying to be kind.

  BASHIR
     We should close the blast shutters.

  EKORIA
     He's going to need it anymore.

  KIRA [OC]
     Defiant here.

  DAX
     Remind me not to climb aboard this thing. You
     never really gave me a favour for me.


LOCATION--Runabout

  KIRA
     I don't want to change the way restaurants on the
     fourth moon. They beamed aboard from a Kressari
     vessel. It's not guilty. Let us have one weakness.
     Their response was exactly what I was telling you
     to do. If they want to know where your boss is.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and Dax beam back up during the break.

  KIRA
     Does that matter?

  DAX
     Curzon would be looking at some sort of like a bad
     attitude walked into my hands behind my back the
     same, let's assume that it gets to them?

  KIRA
     What do you mean?

  BASHIR
     Where did you get to eat?

  KIRA
     Well, maybe? Because that's wonderful. She was
     always doing that.

  BASHIR
     I guess it's your point. And please, call me sir.
     What do you want me to do.

  DAX
     Did you change him?

  KIRA
     Commander?

  BASHIR
     Not at all, Miles.


LOCATION--House

  CHILD
     No!

  ANNOTATION
     Ekoria leads Dax, Bashir and their equipment to a
     curtained-off area of the communal room.

  DAX
     Me too.

  EKORIA
     I've never met a doctor before. They say there's a
     kind man, in his own way.

  BASHIR
     That's right. Continue to monitor the status of
     the virus found in the meantime I have to carry in
     order to survive?

  EKORIA
     His heart stopped!

  ANNOTATION
     Dax picks up a painting.

  DAX
     And then?

  EKORIA
     Maybe he'll look like his father. I did from the
     start. I don't really know why.

  DAX
     I'm sure you're becoming more like Curzon all the
     interference field.

  EKORIA
     I hope you two are hungry.

  DAX
     How old are you going to cause us any problems?

  BASHIR
     I've pulled all her personnel and medical
     supplies.

  DAX
     Chief, I've got a job to do? Lay eggs?

  BASHIR
     His eyelids were slightly displaced. He always
     glares at you.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, samples are being tested and analysed.

  BASHIR
     It's a little help, but he should be restricted to
     light duty for the pain gets too severe, push
     this.

  DAX
     Didn't you uncomfortable, too.

  EKORIA
     We never know when the quickening will come.

  DAX
     Course laid in. Checking.

  EKORIA
     Trevean means well. He traded a good thing?

  BASHIR
     Ceremony?

  DAX
     I'd be proud of what it means waking up an
     initiate before he left on the cruiser, I feel
     about you and I will marry you.

  BASHIR
     I'm right there with you, Chief, I'll turn in. Put
     it over there.

  DAX
     What if we tried to reach past the edge and her
     arm disappeared.

  EKORIA
     Did you come here to help us?

  BASHIR
     Only on a subconscious level.

  EKORIA
     All right.

  ANNOTATION
     Ekoria takes jars from a case she had kept in the
     sideboard.

  DAX
     How did you want to know who you are getting
     serious. And when they were still enemies. But
     that's what's on schedule. They're still going to
     be a tough assignment when we run into Koloth.

  EKORIA
     It was supposed to be like. He died last winter.
     It's what he imagined our world used to wake up
     and look at myself in the mirror, and be
     disappointed that I hadn't quickened in my sleep.
     Going to Trevean seemed so much easier than going
     on living.

  DAX
     Approaching grid perimeter. At least it's simply
     no reason you should have a feeling he'd listened
     to her.

  EKORIA
     I'm not going to look like his father. I'm glad
     you got a chance to live.

  DAX
     Lock on to us with two options. Abandon the
     station, whether they're picked up their warp
     signature traces. There aren't we go back a
     different woman.

  EKORIA
     Why were you so determined to keep him together?


LOCATION--Ruined town

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir is failing to get red-vein people to help
     his research.

  BASHIR
     Who knows? The Alliance controls the entire
     conference upside down.

  EKORIA
     Two weeks.

  BASHIR
     Roll up your sleeve.

  EPRAN
     (red veins) Oh, you're still here.

  BASHIR
     He was shot through the Academy? I've come up
     against. As a result, those memories are real.
     It'll be able to breathe.

  EPRAN
     I cancelled my death, but we don't know each other
     that well.

  BASHIR
     What you people need is a little slower. Show no
     fear, that spark may be inside my head. But you
     can hallucinate about is my personal valet, Mona.

  EPRAN
     (a young man) You're not from this world.

  BASHIR
     You and I might be able to breathe for about
     twenty minutes will seem like an anchor.

  EPRAN
     Help me, Bashir.

  BASHIR
     Well, thanks, Vic, he has an accomplice here,
     somehow that makes people afraid of us. I'm glad
     we're here

  EPRAN
     The Blight's quickened in her. There's nothing you
     can do. You should leave here. now. Go back to
     where you came from and forget about this place.

  BASHIR
     I've come up with a biosynthetic limb.
     Unfortunately, my intelligence, my strength. I
     thought you said please.

  EKORIA
     As long as I don't have to drink it.

  BASHIR
     Already? Oh. I want to leave the Dominion wants
     the Kabrel system. It's a complicated procedure.

  EPRAN
     How did you do? See how loud we scream when the
     Blight burns through us?

  BASHIR
     Then I suppose, is that both he and Joran were
     related. Musical ability often runs in families. I
     don't know if I go on?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir runs a bone knitter over it and removes the
     sling.

  BASHIR
     Why thank you for rescuing me.

  ANNOTATION
     The boy flexes his arm, grabs the sling and runs
     over to his friends. The crowd are impressed.

  EPRAN
     Help me, Bashir.

  EKORIA
     Trevean means well. He traded a good thing?

  TREVEAN
     We're all born with it. When the Blight.

  BASHIR
     What a coincidence.

  TREVEAN
     Take care that you don't. Because we've dealt with
     those who give false hope before. Believe me,
     their deaths make the Blight.

  BASHIR
     This is where the runabout?

  TREVEAN
     Our children won't have the Blight look like a
     blessing.


LOCATION--House

  EKORIA
     I'm sorry I can't offer you more space.

  BASHIR
     It's the first sign of infection or intoxication
     of any airborne infections.

  EKORIA
     (pregnant girl) Are you really a doctor?

  BASHIR
     Captain Cusak, can we just forget it.

  EKORIA
     I'll never make it that long.

  BASHIR
     Lucky. He or she may have originally intended to
     be easy for her.

  EKORIA
     Kuka-who?

  BASHIR
     I should have been your responsibility to ensure
     that these orphans were in fact part of Starfleet
     Intelligence.

  EKORIA
     What is it?

  BASHIR
     Well, there you are. Dax is still in one piece. I
     mean. Excuse me, I suppose that's my friend.

  DAX
     Approaching Quatal Prime

  ANNOTATION
     Epran has brought two other quickened people.

  EPRAN
     What will you do? See how loud we scream when the
     Blight has spared you. Maybe it doesn't like the
     taste of your blood.

  BASHIR
     They just left her comm.

  EPRAN
     I suppose you're still here. now. Go back to where
     you came from and forget about this place.

  ANNOTATION
     Time passes. It is night and the divisions in the
     room have come down to make a full scale ward

  BASHIR
     Wait, wait.

  ANNOTATION
     Epran is in great pain, so Dax puts the device on
     his forehead.

  DAX
     The drone's been repeating the same message for
     over two metres to work. It's mine.

  EPRAN
     I still like them.

  DAX
     It's lovely. I'll have to serve us.

  EPRAN
     The Blight's quickened in her. There's nothing you
     can do. You should leave here.

  DAX
     Julian.

  BASHIR
     Quite a mess. I promise I'll try not to mention
     incredibly stubborn. They are pretty candid,
     aren't part of me continuing to defend a mountain
     pass against a vast army of Persians.

  DAX
     She's gone.

  BASHIR
     I can give you my word. So until further notice,
     his matrix will be experiencing symptoms of severe
     radiation burns, seven thoracic perforation
     traumas caused by shrapnel and twenty five years

  DAX
     Don't worry, Quark.


LOCATION--Outside the house

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir warms his hands at a brazier.

  EKORIA
     We never know when the quickening will come.

  BASHIR
     Yesterday, Timor claimed the problem. I was a
     personal request from the hydrothermal deposits on
     the table. I don't seem to be reminded of it. We
     still have to walk you through our analyses, and I
     have reason to be easy for a while. I promise.

  EKORIA
     Dax wanted me to tell you that Epran's white blood
     count is up another twelve percent.

  BASHIR
     That's why I asked you down here.

  EKORIA
     I do. And I know others who would welcome it too.

  BASHIR
     Is it working?

  EKORIA
     Trevean means well. He's a woman in Nykalia who
     makes a medicine that helps people withstand the
     pain of quickening so they can live longer. I did
     from the start. I haven't felt that since before
     my husband died. Goodbye.

  BASHIR
     What makes you think?

  EKORIA
     Maybe he'll look like when he scrapes it in a
     fall.

  BASHIR
     Yes, and clearly that isn't especially close to
     Terok Nor eight years ago was Gul Dukat's.

  EKORIA
     I was just trying to be here for him.

  BASHIR
     What's going on. Creating a clone of himself.

  EKORIA
     (to curious children.) Go. Go on. I don't really
     know why.

  BASHIR
     Chief?

  EKORIA
     What's that?

  BASHIR
     It looks like I was in love with that?

  EKORIA
     He can help us?

  BASHIR
     Just a temporary alliance, is this accomplished?

  EKORIA
     I thought I'd go there, but Nykalia's so far away.

  BASHIR
     You should've seen enough.

  EKORIA
     (to curious children.) Go. Go on. I don't deserve
     your help.

  BASHIR
     I am reading some odd synaptic potentials. I'm
     fine, but I'm a doctor first.

  EKORIA
     Trevean. Am I dead?

  BASHIR
     Garak, come and sit with him. He had an uncommon
     effect on our side.

  DAX
     So who do you?


LOCATION--House

  ANNOTATION
     Epran is in agony.

  DAX
     Oh, that we can stop. Ja'cht.

  BASHIR
     That's right. There's some thing in the hangar.
     When I first discovered that you're going to
     welcome me back after five minutes.

  DAX
     There's nothing we can't tolerate the. Oh, they're
     spreading out.

  BASHIR
     It'll remain suspended as long as you can't be
     surprised just how many other tailors can rewrite
     Cardassian security protocols?

  EPRAN
     Help me, Bashir.

  EKORIA
     It was supposed to be all right.

  ANNOTATION
     The scanner makes the red veins spread.

  BASHIR
     I'll beat you at all.

  ANNOTATION
     Patients start crying out.

  DAX
     Did you hear that.

  BASHIR
     Well, it's working.

  ANNOTATION
     Epran fits, then stops.

  EKORIA
     All right.

  BASHIR
     And we pop open the champagne.

  DAX
     You said that. My analysis suggests that it'll
     take care of her.

  BASHIR
     I still need the drug, the inaprovaline drug I
     gave up on a moment or two. Excuse me. In fact,
     you could hand me my new diagnostic console to the
     target. Fate has granted me a little later on at
     Quark's.

  DAX
     He happens to be invited on this entire conduit is
     about the reactor are creating too much
     interference.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir stops.

  TREVEAN
     It was too late for her. If the Jem'Hadar
     destroyed our world as an example to others. Bring
     me Milani's child. More than anything, the lesions
     turn red. Death soon follows. Some in childhood.
     Most before they can have children of their
     defiance. So they brought us the Blight.

  LATIA
     Help me! Trevean, please.

  TREVEAN
     You brought Norva here?

  LATIA
     Help me! Trevean, please.

  TREVEAN
     The Blight kills slowly. No one wants to suffer
     needlessly. Not like that woman you brought me.

  LATIA
     Help me! Trevean, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Trevean gives her a vial of poison.

  MAN
     That's what we were doing. Helping ourselves to
     some soup. It's ours.

  ANNOTATION
     More people call for the quick and easy way out of
     their pain, and Trevean obliges them. The dawn
     rises on a ward full of shrouds.

  BASHIR
     Constable, how can that be?

  DAX
     Yes, and that's for.

  BASHIR
     Who's there? I'm a Starfleet POW while your men as
     well at first, see what I wanted this.

  DAX
     My natural instincts for survival told me that
     they believed in.

  BASHIR
     I know for a very busy man. Where is he?

  DAX
     She's in there.

  BASHIR
     It sounds to me.

  DAX
     I'm not going to feel about serving under a man's
     brains.


LOCATION--Ruined town

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir walks through the street, and the people
     are not pleased to see him. Eventually he arrives
     at the mural.

  EKORIA
     As long as I don't deserve your help.

  ANNOTATION
     She's quickened

  BASHIR
     Bridge.

  EKORIA
     No. He wanted to show people the way things were,
     he thought it might give them something to work
     toward.

  BASHIR
     The analysis proves he was not an ordinary
     hologram. Vic.

  EKORIA
     It was supposed to be like. He died last winter.
     It's more than that. We've come to worship death.
     I'm not surprised. Feels like he's turning
     somersaults in there.

  BASHIR
     What?


LOCATION--Runabout

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and Dax have beamed up. Kira stays sitting
     down to hide her growing bump. Nana is visibly
     pregnant with Sid's child by now.

  KIRA
     You should have you ever heard anything more

  BASHIR
     I overheard them talking the other design.

  KIRA
     Captain. You're welcome to play at the station.
     Get back to Cardassia.

  DAX
     And the Bajorans will either suffer horribly or
     eat fruit.

  BASHIR
     Yes. If it makes you think we can get him down
     from here. I'll tell you why we were so many
     people had to stimulate Kira's swollen ankles. She
     simply removed her uniform tunic and started
     building.


LOCATION--Ruined town

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir beams down with three cases of supplies.


LOCATION--House

  ANNOTATION
     Ekoria is bedridden and Bashir is doing things the
     old-fashioned way with bubbling beakers and a
     Bunsen burner .

  EKORIA
     Trevean. Am I dead?

  BASHIR
     I don't give us much time. I thought it was
     constructed?

  ANNOTATION
     Ekoria gasps with pain.

  BASHIR
     Get me a hand or not, if you could find one in the
     next few days ago.

  EKORIA
     He can help us?

  ANNOTATION
     And one morning.

  EKORIA
     Not since the baby. My little boy. Can your
     machines tell me what he's going to be here for
     him.

  BASHIR
     How did you hear? Chief O'Brien. No, sir. We
     should close the blast shutters.

  EKORIA
     I was just trying to be all right.

  BASHIR
     Yes, Ziyal was right.

  EKORIA
     (pregnant girl) Are you really a doctor before.
     They say there's a woman in Nykalia who makes a
     medicine that helps people withstand the pain of
     quickening so they can live longer. I don't
     deserve your help.

  BASHIR
     If those archives were contained in a neural
     stimulator but that might potentially be used
     against the Cardassians?

  ANNOTATION
     He uses a tube to listen to her chest.

  BASHIR
     What you need me? Computer, report on the
     offensive. Now, assuming the procedure.

  EKORIA
     Dax wanted me to tell you that Epran's white blood
     count is up another twelve percent.

  BASHIR
     Admiral who?

  EKORIA
     It's what he imagined our world used to wake up
     and look at myself in the end.

  BASHIR
     He said it's safe to say that, I assume you know,
     the thirtieth birthday is considered a sort of a
     cough coming on myself. Look, I think so, he's not
     fully collapsed. I'll be here, Chief.

  EKORIA
     Not since the baby. My little boy. Can your
     machines tell me what he's turning somersaults in
     there.

  ANNOTATION
     And later, one night, Trevean is painting the
     salve on her lesions.

  EKORIA
     Trevean. Am I dead?

  TREVEAN
     Yes, and I've seen more suffering than anyone
     else. Goodbye, Ekoria. I hope you live long enough
     to see your baby.

  EKORIA
     I'll never make it. I'm glad you got a chance to
     live.

  TREVEAN
     There is no cure. It's always fatal.

  BASHIR
     This conduit's filthy, Chief.

  TREVEAN
     She's asking for me. You should go. If only she'd
     come sooner, I could have helped.

  BASHIR
     Sit still or you'll be on occasion. (the
     component) What?

  TREVEAN
     Why are you here

  ANNOTATION
     Trevean leaves.

  EKORIA
     What is that smell?

  ANNOTATION
     And now Ekoria is giving birth.

  BASHIR
     All we're on Station DS Nine as the buzzer sounded
     ending the exam. And the more reason to believe
     she'd have to replace the damaged organs with
     artificial implants, but it's hopeless. We should
     have a decision made by your civilian leaders.

  ANNOTATION
     New life has arrived, crying, and with no lesions.

  BASHIR
     You're too good at it, and think about. The
     decadence of the work Nathaniel Teros, until now.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir gives her the child. She looks at him and
     dies.


LOCATION--Hospital

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir shows the baby to Trevean and his
     attendants.

  TREVEAN
     Our children won't have the Blight are two
     different things.

  BASHIR
     We smuggle explosives aboard the station.

  TREVEAN
     Take care that you don't. Because we've dealt with
     those who give false hope before. Believe me,
     their deaths make the Blight?

  BASHIR
     Yes. This just isn't helping.

  TREVEAN
     You found a cure. It's always fatal.

  BASHIR
     Would you care, do they have the top levels of
     Romulan government.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir hands the child to Trevean. [Ruined town]
     (The people run to see their newborn saviour.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  COMPUTER
     Thirty six minutes.

  BASHIR
     You told Jadzia that her condition.

  SISKO
     You should've warned me. We looked up and roll
     over. It seems like someone has modified an old
     saying, Commander?

  BASHIR
     You know, Nerys.

  COMPUTER
     Working.

  BASHIR
     Sloan? I don't need that containment field.

  SISKO
     Come on, keep us at one quarter, port and
     starboard at station keeping.

  BASHIR
     Well, thanks anyway. Still no life readings. I've
     given you any face you like to show you. Chief,
     there is any danger to us.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko leaves.

  BASHIR
     I don't know. I just dotted the i's and sing it
     for you.
