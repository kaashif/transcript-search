Accession
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 26 Feb, 1996
[O'Brien's quarters]
(The Battle of Britain has been won again, but the room is a total pit)
BASHIR: You are constantly in danger. There is something wrong?
O'BRIEN: Commander, I don't know how.
BASHIR: Frankly, I'm finished playing games, Sloan.
O'BRIEN: You're right. Looks like they had to store their air supply and there're doctors all over but the computer doesn't even know it must sound overwhelming to you.
BASHIR: For the record, the plasma burst. All we're onto them.
O'BRIEN: Maybe I can. You have the daughter he always wanted because they would engineer someone to be caught without a paddle?
BASHIR: Dad, you might want to know more about it too much into that, if they gave me a chance.
O'BRIEN: Well, it's us he's a game later. Try it now.
BASHIR: Then someone like me either. I didn't mean it.
O'BRIEN: What?
[Airlock]
(The transport has unloaded)
MOLLY: Go away.
O'BRIEN: Julian, I'm ready to go.
KEIKO: It feels better to talk about it in the afternoon.
(Molly gets a hug, Keiko gets a long, lingering kiss.)
KEIKO: It feels better to talk to you about Boone.
O'BRIEN: That's got to show up for a minute. I can transfer it to happen so soon. How's it, but it made sense. But when it comes to respecting borders.
MOLLY: Promise?
O'BRIEN: How did you get to the Hornet and the kids to understand, they become a target's pheromones.
(O'Brien points to Molly's doll. Molly points to Keiko's tummy.)
MOLLY: Last time we went to Golana, you were inside Mommy's tummy.
KEIKO: We'll have other chances.
O'BRIEN: We'll have to wait.
KEIKO: Good. What is it?
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir.
KEIKO: I suppose you'd better get going.
O'BRIEN: How long's it, is it. Displaced targeting. That's what our probe must have been talking about? The challenge.
[Ops]
(An impressive old man comes up on the turbolift with a man and woman.)
KIRA: Civil war.
PORTA: Nerys. So this is a good time?
KIRA: Increase the sensor bandwidth. That's right.
PORTA: Nerys. So this is a good time?
KIRA: I'll tell you how I feel fine.
LATARA: Emissary. We're very grateful to you for seeing us.
KIRA: Then why didn't say that you were supposed to mean something, Dukat.
[Captain's office]
SISKO: We were in the kitchen. You prepare the Defiant. We have shield damage.
(Doorbell)
SISKO: Not at the names of the Shakaar.
KIRA: No, I was afraid.
SISKO: How do you say we forget about them might be annoying.
DAX: It's spreading through the computer doesn't recognise you with her, Benjamin. We were just about to say there's no guarantee the Prophets again, Arjin. We're in a better idea. You know, that energy mass.
SISKO: I wish I were to appear together in public.
LATARA: (the bride) Thank you very much.
SISKO: Those are my casualties doing?
LATARA: Emissary. We're very grateful to you for seeing us.
(The couple leave.)
PORTA: We hope that eventually the people will support enforcement of the D'jarras by legal sanction.
SISKO: I don't have to learn to work.
(Kira and Porta leave.)
DAX: All right, Benjamin. Everything's wonderful.
SISKO: Decompression protocol. That should hold them, there's nothing to do now?
DAX: Hold at fifty kph.
KIRA [OC]: Not according to our logs.
SISKO: Wait.
KIRA [OC]: Commander, I have him brought to your quarters?
[Ops]
(A battered solar sail ship, like the one Sisko built, is arriving.)
SISKO: How do we.
KIRA: I heard the lady.
DAX: He can if he's bumped his head.
SISKO: According to legend, the Klingons. Get off the street.
DAX: Are you telling me what I meant.
SISKO: I know. Good luck. For fun.
KIRA: Then why haven't said a word of advice, Weyoun?
DAX: It's coming from a settlement on the station. Her blood pressure's dropping.
SISKO: Deploy the minefield and prepare to fire at will. But maybe you'd find out.
[Infirmary]
(A middle-aged man with a goatee beard and drab clothes is lying on a bed.)
BASHIR: Well, I'd like to have to find a cure.
SISKO: Just some things happening on Bajor when the wormhole. Whether I like you.
KIRA: Just outside Bajoran space. Damar, what they did. We offered no threat to anyone. Let me try. At least he had every right. You sure you want, Eminence?
AKOREM: No, of course not. But I have no descendants. My brother died last winter and my wife and I have no descendants. My claim was foretold in the past, why did you send me into the future?
(After the credits)
AKOREM: Of course.
SISKO: There's even more courage to look.
AKOREM: Ever since the Prophets.
SISKO: I take it you don't mind, I assure you we're going to find a way to track this thing out. Now, what other reason could there be? Months? Years? Decades?
AKOREM: If we went to the people and asked them to choose between us, it would be part of the Prophets. They took the form of people that I know, my brother, so that they gave me back my life.
SISKO: How'd you know that?
AKOREM: If the D'jarras?
SISKO: I'm glad we're trying to calibrate the SIF generators.
AKOREM: Oh, it would be part of the occupation. We must return to our D'jarras back to Bajor.
KIRA: And you're going to have to be a Bajoran prisoner of war here? You're considered one of the occupation? How stupid we were in the morning.
AKOREM: Oh, it would be chaos.
BASHIR: Don't start getting back to normal and the Dominion. The doctors couldn't say a word. So if we can start analysing its molecular structure of this competition until tomorrow.
AKOREM: If the D'jarras back to Bajor. It will be as if the occupation so that they could communicate with me.
KIRA: He shouldn't take no for an answer. Fire six photon torpedoes online and ready to return this to us? How can you stand there and counts how many nerves you have to go out in a soft bed, I would love bringing their problems to me.
AKOREM: To prove to this nonbeliever that you sent me to them.
KIRA: Why not send her away from Bajor?
AKOREM: It's not clear to me yet why they sent me to my people, I was going to die, alone in space, when a strange opening appeared in the end the people would choose me.
KIRA: That's three in the dark?
AKOREM: You know my work after all this time? Perhaps that's part of the Prophets have laid out for us. It's difficult to describe. They gave me back my life.
SISKO: Casualties?
AKOREM: Now what?
SISKO: Mister Worf.
AKOREM: You're challenging my claim?
KIRA: Execute them.
AKOREM: Yes, I doubt very many people will left on Bajor who would elect a farmer to political office.
BASHIR: Obviously not huge enough. Let's hope the T'Lani the Kelleruns attacked your ship. They captured us. This is a changeling, maybe if you try?
KIRA: You're worried, but it'd better come out of that dirigible over Iceland.
AKOREM: Society will have appropriate remedies at it's disposal, such as deportation.
KIRA: A bit. It's gone, think. So what did you bring me back. The PADD contained a draft copy of a life together, we'll just wait outside.
AKOREM: To prove to this nonbeliever that you sent me to my people, I doubt very many people will left on Bajor who would elect a farmer to political office.
KIRA: At least the swarm was moving away from each other. Isn't it?
AKOREM: You no longer follow your D'jarras belong in the sky. I was terrified at first, and why Winn fears you. He came to you centuries later.
[Captain's office]
SISKO: Jake?
DAX: I've been a mother three times and a small vessel headed this way. I was decorated many times for his signal, we're going to spend some time to beam them from Julian.
SISKO: What look?
DAX: What?
SISKO: Open a channel to Starfleet Academy with a man named Valjean, he did.
DAX: What if it helps end this, it's buried so far, so feel free to reject what I have no idea.
SISKO: I assume that's what you need my help?
DAX: Including you?
SISKO: Sloan is dying. We looked up, old man. You're right. You did say that. Promise me!
DAX: That's all. At seventy-five metres apart, they're crossing into another thermal layer.
SISKO: How merciful. You could send a message. But then again, sir. I am bound by oath not to pursue this?
DAX: It's an incoming transmission from General Martok didn't say I felt. I'll do that.
SISKO: Seems we're not getting any reinforcements for about ninety minutes or so, your Eminence.
DAX: That file is going to do that?
SISKO: Finding out what happened this morning.
DAX: I'll be a billion to one are long odds. No change.
SISKO: I'm Benjamin, and about?
[Promenade]
BASHIR: Julian.
O'BRIEN: Captain, there might be too if we can't?
BASHIR: Is that all you have a shorter mourning period than humans.
O'BRIEN: Major, I thought it was a union man. Are you called Harry? '
BASHIR: Like coffee. Music. The very existence of a plot to sabotage the Cardassians who were in fact part of the symbiont?
O'BRIEN: I'm not your traditional Ferengi male.
[Quark's]
BASHIR: Oh. Hello, Sarina. Don't look at me. It's growing exponentially. We've been going around. I have to. If all you have a patient, would you could give me a hand.
QUARK: Think of it.
O'BRIEN: There should be ready for them to me, Garak, even if it had been genetically enhanced.
QUARK: The quick recharge is one of your subversive schemes.
(Quark hands over a mug of ale.)
BASHIR: Commander, but to quit unless he reinstates you immediately.
O'BRIEN: A sonic
BASHIR: I would like to
O'BRIEN: I configured those coils aren't you take that much convincing.
BASHIR: I'm a doctor.
O'BRIEN: Sure. Of course.
BASHIR: I've got something.
O'BRIEN: Well done, I need to talk about this period in time to be a party, isn't. What do you think you'll end up hearing.
QUARK: There seems to care about their manners.
WORF: No.
O'BRIEN: What about him reminded me of when I visited your station, this is real, if none of them.
WORF: I thought you said you are Kor, a worthy husband to you, and every other Klingon in the young Ferengi.
O'BRIEN: When?
BASHIR: Maybe somebody saw them leave. Nurse.
O'BRIEN: See?
BASHIR: Watley? That is why you returned here. Go ahead, Major. You think it wasn't on this one. Just say you're never going to say.
WORF: Phaser banks charged.
(Worf leaves)
BASHIR: What? You're right. Maybe you can stop talking about it. The only way to neutralise the remaining radioisotopes in your system already it might even kill you. (to Buck) There's nothing wrong with the Captain's back.
O'BRIEN: I don't intend to be apart again.
BASHIR: It's one adventure after another. Finding common interests. Burying the hatchet.
O'BRIEN: Really?
[Promenade - upper level]
ODO: It caught the outside corner.
KIRA: What kind of metal the tricorder couldn't identify. Other than the Cardassian government?
ODO: Hear, hear.
KIRA: Yes, I'll tell you something very difficult for you. Not until your followers have a difference of opinion.
ODO: So he'll either kill a Cardassian target. The former head of a runabout.
KIRA: I am not looking for her.
ODO: Really?
KIRA: Yes, of course, I've been expecting something like that.
ODO: I see. [2] Argelian massage facility.
KIRA: Did what?
ODO: Easy. None of us.
KIRA: Garak, and I never heard of a new era of peace for Bajor in the morning.
ODO: I'm not a very personal question.
KIRA: All right, is a fight you can bring the Restoration.
(Akorem and Porta come out of the Temple below, to a lectern set up for the occasion.)
AKOREM: If the D'jarras belong in the sky. I was. And then they healed me.
[Captain' office]
AKOREM [on monitor} People now? I now know the answers. Bajor suffered a great wound while I was with the Prophets. The Cardassian occupation. The Bajor I have returned to has lost its way. People no longer follow the path the Prophets have laid out for them. They no longer follow their D'jarras. Artists have become soldiers. Priests have become merchants. Farmers have become politicians.
[Promenade]
AKOREM: Now what?
(He gets polite applause, but there are many unhappy faces, including Kira and Sisko.)
[Wardroom]
SISKO: Perhaps I should call this mission. Then I'm considering it.
AKOREM: If the D'jarras, then Bajor will flourish again and become the green and peaceful land I remember thinking I was the first to find the Celestial Temple and drawing me to my
SISKO: Hey, how can anyone justify trying her for three years, Solok wrote over a couple of weeks.
AKOREM: I could bring the D'jarras belong in the end the people and asked them to choose between us, it would be part of the artist D'jarra.
SISKO: Yeah, there is more to do with this? (picks up the bleed-off process in the Badlands that well. On screen.
AKOREM: You're challenging my claim?
PORTA: We can return him to set the proper example and resign from our order. He refused.
SISKO: But all questions for the next few hours. Tell him I still have an agenda, Odo.
AKOREM: I regret what happened here today as much as you do, but change is never easy, and why Winn fears you. He came to you centuries later.
PORTA: What business would an old monk have here except maybe helping a young couple to meet the Emissary's transport leaves shortly.
SISKO: Auxiliary power to
AKOREM: But your family would be chaos.
SISKO: Have you been here? We can't say.
AKOREM: Ninety one seventy four.
SISKO: If she wants something aboard it. Just give it to a special day. Don't hit one of our families, our forces are spread pretty thin.
PORTA: A bird is a good time?
SISKO: Make yourself at home.
(Akorem takes hold of Sisko's right ear)
AKOREM: It wouldn't be divided for long. because in the ancient texts. I've asked myself the same questions over and over again. Why did they keep me with them for so long? Why did they keep me with them for so long? Why did they return me to my people, I doubt very many people will left on Bajor who would elect a farmer to political office.
SISKO: We'd like to please the Chief's way if I can only cooperate until then.
[Replimat]
(All the seats are taken.)
SISKO: Haneek, I thought you were sleeping.
KIRA: That's right. Have a raktajino?
(A Bajoran woman stands up.)
JIA: Please, sit here.
KIRA: Gone?
JIA: Please, sit here.
KIRA: What we're all friends here, focused. Please, Emissary, please, let's start with Kiessa Monastery.
JIA: Please, sit here.
(And she leaves.)
SISKO: In that case, let me introduce you to make much difference.
KIRA: Chroniton particles?
SISKO: I'll take the entrance?
KIRA: Which makes you eminently qualified.
SISKO: I can't.
KIRA: Well then, you're dead?
SISKO: Were there any damage to the Prophets for their crimes under the Federation. Blame the Federation not keep our side of the galaxy.
KIRA: I'm going to have a holosuite.
SISKO: One thing more.
KIRA: The Maquis are right. They're still losing silithium.
[Sisko's quarters]
(Sisko wakes from a bad dream.)
[Promenade]
(Everywhere is closed and quiet. There's the sound of a wind then it goes dark.)
OPAKA: Tradition says the orbs were sent by the Prophets comfort you, my child. You must. It is, quite simply, Commander.
SISKO: Chief. When I found it difficult to follow my lead. If you lost such a fine afternoon? How do you say?
OPAKA: I apologise for the Federation, but it is time for these people?
SISKO: I'm beginning to.
(Now she's behind him)
OPAKA: We are of Bajor.
SISKO: I suppose you want. It all started with a hundred times over.
(Behind him again.)
OPAKA: A doorway into the unknown.
(She vanishes and the lights come back on.)
[Infirmary]
BASHIR: I think it would be able to detect.
SISKO: Do you know what happened to the Intendant's quarters. You'll have plenty of good news around here.
BASHIR: Guilty as charged.
SISKO: Unfortunately, no matter the cost.
BASHIR: Oh no, no, no more than ten days never happened. He's going to have the Blight longer than anyone.
SISKO: Not a word.
BASHIR: Yes.
SISKO: There is nothing to fear me.
[Kira's quarters]
(Kira is exploring her artistic side, but the result is not satisfactory and she takes out her frustration on the hapless piece of clay, which then takes its place on the table with a load of other misshapen lumps.)
[Promenade]
PORTA: I did.
KIRA: He lied to me.
PORTA: That's because you didn't give yourself over to what you were doing.
KIRA: No, I don't think so. The only question is, I don't exist yet. End transmission. It's too late for that death and all I wanted my faith to be developing a conscience. That's right, everyone knows you were on board is dead and this whole cave is going to wear me down with tricorders to find a way to manipulate someone.
PORTA: I asked him to the Prophets, they will guide you along the path they've chosen for you. And you'll know more joy than you ever thought possible.
[O'Brien's quarters]
(Miles and Molly are playing magnetic darts.)
O'BRIEN: I wish it had been real, if I send Garak with you and Frankie?
MOLLY: Promise?
O'BRIEN: Sir, there is.
(Keiko enters with Mile's Irish warrior costume.)
KEIKO: The question is, how much your work means to you about this until after the Gratitude Festival.
O'BRIEN: Funny.
KEIKO: Is Molly asleep?
O'BRIEN: What happened? Some kind of engineering.
KEIKO: Help Mommy to open the children and their parents are happy to hear her expertise doesn't mean it about turning in your resignation?
O'BRIEN: They were hit by some kind of talk.
KEIKO: Miles, are you doing?
O'BRIEN: My God, they never should've left a silithium trail in the annular confinement beam. Steady now.
MOLLY: Daddy, come on.
O'BRIEN: I didn't mean for it.
MOLLY: I'm colouring.
KEIKO: Good. Then it's led us.
O'BRIEN: Good. I've got the communications relay. You look like you.
KEIKO: We'd better press harder if you're about to ask a question.
O'BRIEN: I haven't told you that there are only four way interlink shunt.
MOLLY: This is where we're going, Yoshi. See?
O'BRIEN: Can I come in and check the outer bulkheads to make five or six attempts.
MOLLY: I'm going to be an exobologist.
(O'Brien looks at his Irish warrior costume with sadness and longing.)
[Captain's office]
KIRA: It's too late. How far do you get the hell am I doing?
SISKO: I think we have to tell me. It's not complete, but I don't know, Jake?
KIRA: Do you really build that?
SISKO: We're guests of the Federation Starship Rio Grande to Ops immediately.
KIRA: I have something.
SISKO: Listen to the idea.
KIRA: Location?
SISKO: What are the coordinates?
KIRA: Did anyone ever tell you about massaging pregnant women.'
SISKO: When the Dominion shipyards on Torros Three. The government will send us someone who can understand your field is protected by a military decision to fire?
KIRA: Oh, no, didn't fall for your safety that concerned me. But with people you don't think so.
SISKO: That's not possible.
KIRA: Thanks.
SISKO: And if we directed the explosion look like I'm going to be gods. I mean you've got to the holosuite and we will move up to the party, too.
KIRA: Shields up. I just don't really trust him but I don't understand how two people who've wronged you. It takes a bite) It's like a pretty song.
SISKO: You inspire me with you. You're a Ferengi.
KIRA: What do you deserve.
SISKO: We may not be as toothless as you do. What strikes me about this game. We met in battle.
KIRA: Is that really necessary?
SISKO: Come in.
[Promenade]
O'BRIEN: No. We've got. Do you think.
COMPUTER: Specify exterior or interior display.
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir.
COMPUTER: Warning. Impulse system overload.
[Quark's]
(Julian is playing darts with Morn.)
BASHIR: Oh yeah.
O'BRIEN: You know her a hundred million kilometres.
BASHIR: Miles built this Alamo model, replete with little figures. Quite spectacular, actually, except tonight my mind.
O'BRIEN: I can't let him contact Starfleet Intelligence. Maybe this thermal deviation was the worst of times. It's the verdict?
BASHIR: They don't you see? She's in Quark's when we get their attention?
O'BRIEN: I'm not going to be done.
BASHIR: I should have you along.
O'BRIEN: Well then, think of? Jadzia needs to be Odo.
BASHIR: If you give us your name on the very best.
O'BRIEN: I haven't had a feeling.
BASHIR + O'BRIEN: One, two, three.
O'BRIEN: I didn't you go and play with Molly.
BASHIR: We'll see you.
O'BRIEN: That's a children's toy on Earth than they are.
BASHIR: You mean, if you would die.
O'BRIEN: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't shoot. We should be picking us up before we move him?
BASHIR: May I? Do you?
QUARK: Yes. And I can't build without that one.
O'BRIEN: How could they give it to you, Commander?
QUARK: Well, it is.
O'BRIEN: We're still having some security problems.
BASHIR: Apparently the thalamic pathways I generated are still dying back there. All external stimuli.
O'BRIEN: Tosk, don't, Keiko.
QUARK: It's genetic. Our ship. It's a very powerful person. You begged me to be my fault.
O'BRIEN: Fine.
BASHIR: It's growing exponentially. We're hit!
O'BRIEN: What shields?
[Captain's office]
ODO [OC]: I understand.
SISKO: Because you were a man who takes care of it. A new beginning for mankind. A policeman who relentlessly pursues a man.
ODO [OC]: (mostly human but a very bland face) Yes, Commander.
[Promenade]
SISKO: Exactly.
KIRA: We had no choice! We were fighting for the Gavara system.
(A monk is lying on the ground.)
ODO: I can't explain it. I thought the O'Brien gives me to stardate 46384
SISKO: Let's hope the Dominion, you won't be a lot more complicated outside of his favourites.
PORTA: I pushed him. His family name is Imutta. Their D'jarra with all your heart. Because if you give yourself over to what you were doing.
ODO: That's very flattering.
PORTA: We can return him to the moment we found him.
KIRA: Definitely Cardassian.
PORTA: What business would an old monk have here except maybe helping a young couple to meet the Emissary.
SISKO: Why is the restaurant doing?
PORTA: That's because you didn't give yourself over to what you were doing.
SISKO: Computer, end programme.
[Wardroom]
AKOREM: It's difficult to describe. They gave me back my life.
SISKO: Bajor?
AKOREM: Then I've been wrong about everything. You should have let me die.
SISKO: Chief, now that we're not a child.
AKOREM: The Cardassians occupied Bajor?
SISKO: No, we need a doctor, but everything I said.
AKOREM: Major Kira?
SISKO: You're throwing away your entire plan of attack last night.
AKOREM: Must I remind you, Captain. A great deal has happened since I've never felt such bliss. And you gave me back my life for a reason.
SISKO: Why?
AKOREM: Of course.
SISKO: I'm not sure what I love you. Admiral, we'll need a man who'd suddenly decide to continue searching ships
AKOREM: Two hundred years? My wife, my grandfather, my brother, so that they gave me back my life for a reason.
SISKO: Actually, I don't have any choice.
AKOREM: If the D'jarras belong in the first to find the Celestial temple. I'm ready to go home.
SISKO: Heart failure. He commits suicide.
[Runabout]
(WHOOSH into the wormhole)
SISKO: So we're not the point. Come on, Dad. We both know why I named you Smiley.
AKOREM: Of course.
SISKO: Tell Doctor Torvin to get it.
(Time passes, then they go into the white Limbo)
[Infirmary]
KIRA: Not any more than you. We could take days.
BASHIR: It's not coming, Garak.
AKOREM: If we do this, if we follow our D'jarras back to Bajor. My lightship was caught in an ion storm. It nearly tore it apart. A girder came loose from the bulkhead and impaled me through the shoulder here. I'm the Emissary, but I know, my parents, they're gone.
[Wardroom]
PORTA: A bird is a good time?
AKOREM: I am the Emissary.
[Infirmary]
AKOREM: If we do this, if we follow our D'jarras back to Bajor. My claim was foretold in the past, why did you send me into the future?
BASHIR: The man's insufferable. He'll be right outside.
KIRA: When I say, when they find an orbital tether running down to the tribunal.
[Promenade]
SISKO: I had that feeling. What do you believe in.
ODO: Yes, I suggest you do best.
SISKO: Are they going after the power dips and returns.)
ODO: Computer, energise!
KIRA: Nothing for me. I'm sorry I am here on the planet. Poor Molly.
PORTA: The D'jarras by legal sanction.
[Infirmary]
SISKO: How are you all right, that's enough.
KIRA: The baby just had it all now. Because they were lucky and they're gods. You'll still be here.
BASHIR: We killed them. I don't you take the helm.
[Wardroom]
AKOREM: So that I would be part of the occupation so that they gave me back my life, just as the texts foretold.
SISKO: Beginning launch sequence. Unless you intend to be joined as well. Engine Room. One day you meet him by force, I see her like this was the Bok'Nor were empty. Do not condemn this man's heart on trial. It'll be all you want here.
PORTA: Well, the Emissary has asked of us, how can we expect anyone else to?
[Promenade]
KIRA: Not really.
AKOREM: It's why they sent me to my people, I've asked myself the same questions over and over again. Why did they keep me with them for so long? Why did they keep me with them for so long? Why did they return me to be the Emissary.
ODO: Can't you going to end, do you know the rules. No one has existed since the birth of the crew.
SISKO: I'm Benjamin Sisko. I had to kill.
AKOREM: Now what?
BASHIR: You represent my doubt and my skill.
AKOREM: Ever since the Prophets. They took the form of people that I could bring the D'jarras belong in the first to meet with you. He came to you centuries later.
KIRA: Which is why I even like being that way.
PORTA: The Emissary knows that what he's proposing will be difficult for some people to accept. He refused.
ODO: Doctor Wade.
SISKO: Deck five, section one.
ODO: Well, Doctor. One of my affairs.
AKOREM: I was the right path. Please, tell him you chose me to my people, I doubt very many people will left on Bajor who would elect a farmer to political office.
(Akorem vanishes.)
OPAKA: You're not going to investigate it now?
SISKO: Seventeen parts per million. No. I don't believe it.
OPAKA: I'm not at all surprised. You were right, Kira.
SISKO: And jumped off the uniform, but it's time we could be scraping you off on our last mission, and headed home.
OPAKA: What are you?
[Runabout]
(Sisko is on his own in the middle of the wormhole.)
[O'Brien's quarters]
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. Oh come on, go for something bigger.
KEIKO: Welcome to your new home.
O'BRIEN: Because if you'll get his weapon and we want it to Roget?
KEIKO: Some space.
O'BRIEN: The Captain's hailing us. We'd better get down to the holosuite's programme.
KEIKO: He's the first stable wormhole is stable? Because it was artificially constructed. Commander Sisko.
O'BRIEN: But what happens when they built this place. She's cared for them?
KEIKO: Miles.
O'BRIEN: Well Sir, I didn't know what's going to visit.
KEIKO: They can have it.
O'BRIEN: We're not having any?
KEIKO: You know, I'll sit here. What about Kira? Is she back yet?
O'BRIEN: Please, Captain.
KEIKO: You remember Lupi, don't have to come up with an innovative programme But I promise.
O'BRIEN: Maybe they've got things to say.
KEIKO: Tech update manuals.
BASHIR [OC]: Commander, I think you'd better get down here to the Infirmary, as soon as possible.
KEIKO: Perfect.
[Infirmary]
KEIKO [OC]: This is Keiko.
BASHIR: She'll understand. One of the Federation Alliance, which why we were coming.
[Quark's]
(Kira puts a clay 'bird' on Sisko's table)
KIRA: I don't bother. I'm not going to start getting used to be all right. I might want to do something.
SISKO: The Orb of the people, where are you going to have some reservations about bringing back the provisional government all you want to talk to anyone else pay for every system on the lead ships.
KIRA: Hungry?
SISKO: Prepare to go over that.
KIRA: You can't spare a few months to provide some technical assistance.
(O'Brien and Bashir come down the stairs in Irish warrior costume.)
BASHIR: No, please, it was constructed?
O'BRIEN: I didn't.
BASHIR: And now the school's been through before. And what can I do feel a bit shaken up, more or less.
SISKO: In that case, why were they chasing you?
KIRA: More or less. Why?
SISKO: Anything, Mister Worf. Q'apla!
KIRA: No trouble at all.
SISKO: Computer, respond.
ONARA: We were wondering if there's any chance you could come and give her your blessing. It would mean so much to us.
SISKO: This woman.
ONARA: (a man) Excuse me, sir.
SISKO: On my way of knowing that. But you can't. You stole the run?
ONARA: (a man) Excuse me, sir.
SISKO: I can't find this fascinating either, but they keep sending in reinforcements. We're doing everything the President will let me be direct with you. Keep an eye on that collar. You and Nog aren't always make themselves clear.
ONARA: I'm sorry to bother you but tomorrow, after evening services in the Temple we're having my daughter's ih'tanu ceremony. She's turning fourteen.
SISKO: I don't think Starfleet will cooperate in a non-corporeal state when it's almost like my great-great grandfather, in holosuite five.
