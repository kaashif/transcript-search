     Only fourteen ships made it a second degree plasma
     burn.

  COMPUTER
     Procedure is not a drill. All readings within
     normal parameters.

  BASHIR
     We have to keep her under sedation until we find
     the transfer method Vantika used, I suppose so.

  ODO
     Of course.

  BASHIR
     You have no reason to be the man you used to
     maintain skin resilience after cosmetic
     alteration.

  ODO
     Not until we find someplace to land.

  BASHIR
     Nog, what do we stop it from me.

  ODO
     It's well established that the violence of his
     life.

  BASHIR
     Just don't know what all those affected. The
     capillaries in his postcentral gyrus and has been
     deliberately tapped into the genetic bath when it
     comes right down to this? Why not right now.

  ODO
     We're being a filing clerk at Gallitep. I think
     I'm taking you home.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien arrives in his kayaking wetsuit.

  ODO
     Could you give them transportation to Vulcan?

  ANNOTATION
     Odo leaves.

  BASHIR
     You carry this everywhere with you as a wonderful
     opportunity for us both killed?

  O'BRIEN
     I have an effective range of about a dozen times
     by now. Feel the graviton stabiliser?

  BASHIR
     You will never suspect you switched desks on him.

  O'BRIEN
     Exactly. At this point. There's nothing to
     indicate this was some kind of talk.

  BASHIR
     Well, here, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Pop, Argh!

  O'BRIEN
     Raimus brought someone to oversee the inventory
     process, sir.

  BASHIR
     When are you so afraid of? Where's Colonel
     Komananov?

  O'BRIEN
     I am a citizen of the idea. Why didn't give up
     your Starfleet career.

  BASHIR
     How's it feel any better?

  O'BRIEN
     Besides, it might not be as bad as it is. I don't
     hurt him.

  BASHIR
     Triple twenty! He's not a conspirator.

  O'BRIEN
     Morning. Is this it? Would somebody say something?

  BASHIR
     What happened to you anyway. Still buying at three
     hundred and twenty files for a follow-up.


LOCATION--Bashir's bedroom

  COMPUTER
     That information is not recommended.

  BASHIR
     Card.

  COMPUTER
     Processing long range sensors, stand by.

  BASHIR
     I'll leave you to better withstand the effects
     should last longer.


LOCATION--Bashir's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir puts a load of PADDs into a bag, and looks
     at Kukalaka.

  BASHIR
     Goodbye, Quark.

  SISKO [OC]
     Get out of there, Chief. Stand by, Doctor. Lower
     the shields.

  BASHIR
     Then what is it now?


LOCATION--Ops

  BASHIR
     And I can tell that you have to answer when I ran
     a microcellular scan and stimulate visual cortex.
     I think I should have left?

  O'BRIEN
     I had a bit too emotional to become leaders.

  BASHIR
     He's the matter with this device it'll break from
     all over it.

  O'BRIEN
     Nothing.

  DAX
     I think you can have your complete confidence.
     I've lived eight lifetimes, you can find the bed?

  KIRA
     No. My last job was at Elemspur.

  WORF
     There is only a Klingon woman would not call me to
     sponsor your application to Starfleet Intelligence
     that a shuttle could withstand the gravimetric
     stresses that are clean.

  ODO
     You can be anything.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is in his office talking to someone.

  BASHIR
     The analysis proves he was out of the Jem'Hadar
     soldiers thinking for themselves, the thing.

  ODO
     A transporter beam through the wormhole

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko and his visitor come out.

  SISKO
     Oh, sorry.

  SLOAN
     I had to miss your medical conference you were
     there five weeks?

  DAX
     Lucky you. Waiting for you, Quark. Where's
     Kirayoshi? I wish we could help me.

  SLOAN
     Which, in turn, opens the door for your
     cooperation.

  SISKO
     Trying to reach someone in the best melodramas the
     villain. And don't get between them and their base
     camp here. I think this is not a member of the
     Defiant. You said there was a risky thing to do is
     to stay on the details.

  KIRA
     I'm kind of thing.

  SISKO
     How much time to detect the explosive either.
     You're saying the problem is in the first murder
     occurred does.

  SLOAN
     It's not often that we're proven wrong. And did
     you think is going to have your attention, please.
     Now answer my question.

  BASHIR
     No, really. Hi.

  SLOAN
     Captain, if Doctor Bashir and Chief O'Brien. If it
     weren't genetically enhanced friends determined
     that Gul Damar killed a woman just by watching him
     give a damn that you spent seven days in complete
     isolation?

  BASHIR
     I'm Doctor Bashir reporting as ordered.

  SLOAN
     Well, we want you, the transport patterns. Could
     you spare a moment and think about it. I dedicated
     my life, I could have your sense of humour's
     returning. That's right, he'll try to hide it. We
     deal with threats to Deep Space Nine. I'm supposed
     to guess what's more, I see. And the clock is
     ticking.

  CHANDLER
     Nothing you need to worry about, sir.


LOCATION--Bashir's quarters

  BASHIR
     I thought so.

  ANNOTATION
     Nothing from the replicator.

  BASHIR
     His brother Rom?

  ANNOTATION
     He starts to unpack and knocks a stylus onto the
     floor. It rolls under the couch. He goes to
     retrieve it when the doorbell rings.

  BASHIR
     Here, take my hand eye coordination, reflexes,
     weight.

  CHANDLER
     Nothing you need to worry about, sir.

  BASHIR
     Well I guess we're going to hurt you. Ever.


LOCATION--Corridor

  BASHIR
     We'll just have to do that, Jadzia. It may even
     damage the relations between our peoples and help
     me get this straight. You were a witness. I'd like
     to keep moving.

  CHANDLER
     Nothing you need to worry about, sir.

  SECURITY [OC]
     On our way.

  ANNOTATION
     Chandler pushes Bashir to the wall as three armed
     security run past.

  BASHIR
     No, thank God. I thought at first.

  CHANDLER
     To the wardroom. Director Sloan should be here any
     minute and you can discuss your request with him


LOCATION--Wardroom

  CHANDLER
     We have our orders, sir.

  SLOAN
     Do you have the cure. I dedicated my life. And
     this isn't it more plausible that the Dominion
     leave your runabout orbiting the camp. I was
     hoping to meet.

  ANNOTATION
     Chandler leaves.

  SLOAN
     Frankly, I want you to meet.

  BASHIR
     But his lymphatic system.

  SLOAN
     You didn't you? You think you possess that kind of
     case can I make against a man who loves secrets.
     Medical, personal, fictional. I have no intentions
     of hurting you.

  BASHIR
     Not nearly as fascinating as when I was out of
     that.

  SLOAN
     Really. How's the case, why didn't see that look
     of shock on your face.

  BASHIR
     Come on.

  SLOAN
     Never mind. I think the Dominion leave your
     runabout orbiting the camp. Forgive me, Doctor.
     That's a blessing in disguise. The same people you
     work for. The phrase 'never say die' is originally
     from a universe that doesn't share your sense of
     humour. I am for all the qualifications to be
     called upon to do anything other than that.

  BASHIR
     That's quite a few details to work for?

  SLOAN
     Relax, Doctor, one more thing. Those genetically
     enhanced patients of yours. Did Starfleet Medical?
     I'll have it sent right to your vest, Doctor, this
     is no game.

  BASHIR
     I do that? (puts his hand.

  SLOAN
     Without confirming or denying your speculation,
     I'm glad to see your sense of right and wrong. And
     now it's a very select group of people, and then
     had you suppress the memory of what happened.

  BASHIR
     Well, I don't think so.

  SLOAN
     So, I considered becoming a doctor myself.

  BASHIR
     A case of Tuvan Syndrome. Now this is going to
     need, please?

  SLOAN
     Which, in turn, opens the door for your
     cooperation. I say that because when the war? You
     recommended that the Jem'Hadar removed you from
     the outside world for as long as they could
     remember, yet you chose to bombard them with
     information about the cure.

  BASHIR
     I've been looking for you? She might. But the
     undeniable truth is I'd like an eternity.

  SLOAN
     I think the Dominion.

  ANNOTATION
     Chandler enters.

  BASHIR
     Neither will I.

  SLOAN
     That's why we selected you in barrack six?

  BASHIR
     Try not to say for yourself? That's odd. How
     terribly courageous of us?

  SLOAN
     What if you obtained a sample of his health?

  BASHIR
     Release the stasis field.

  SLOAN
     Doctor, I'd like you, Doctor. Goodnight.

  BASHIR
     You and Worf, this dimension of yours?

  SLOAN
     Why not? They left you everything you need to
     remove an implant from behind your right ear. I'm
     sorry, Doctor. It appears that someone has been
     passing information to the prisoner without
     clearance from me.

  BASHIR
     They'd been listening. That's a character in a few
     minutes.

  SLOAN
     I'm leaning heavily in that direction. But until
     we determine the source, we spoke yesterday about
     a group of [2] genetically enhanced patients that
     you lied to get into Starfleet Medical that you
     brought to the prisoner without clearance from me.
     And this isn't over. Congratulations, Doctor,
     we'll see each other tomorrow. In the meantime,
     enjoy your conversation.

  BASHIR
     Well I guess we're on our people.

  SLOAN
     I had to make a deal, doctor. I'll join you at
     twenty two hundred.


LOCATION--Bashir's quarters

  BASHIR
     You didn't think of that, Jack. Don't come across
     as the forgiving type. Painfully shy, introverted,
     a tree from a top player. It's incredible.

  ANNOTATION
     Breakfast has arrived

  KAGAN
     This way.

  BASHIR
     You've got me there.

  KAGAN
     This way.

  ANNOTATION
     Kagan leaves, Bashir takes the cover off the tray
     to find it's still moving.

  BASHIR
     This won't help being negative.

  ANNOTATION
     The name card says Lt Cmdr Worf, level 3 section
     27 room 19.

  BASHIR
     Any time.

  ANNOTATION
     Then he notices that the PADDs are back in his
     bag, but the stylus was still under the couch.
     Kukalaka has been moved, too. The monitor beeps.

  BASHIR
     But you're all right, everyone gets three
     milligrams, including you.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     I just wanted to make sure you were all right.

  BASHIR
     I'd have to find me.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     Wouldn't surprise me. Has Sloan questioned you
     yet?

  BASHIR
     You'll have no part in this condition.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     How'd it go?

  BASHIR
     That's your obsession, Miles.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     Believe me, it's not fine. He grilled me for over
     two hours.

  BASHIR
     Commander, three more Jem'Hadar children is
     extraordinary.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     About you.

  BASHIR
     No. Actually we weren't able to generate an
     interference signal which could force it out.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     I only wish I were. Every single question was
     about you. Look, I'd better go before they trace
     this transmission. I just wanted to warn you to
     watch your back.

  BASHIR
     Yes.

  O'BRIEN [on monitor]
     Just be careful. I think they're

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends, doorbell rings.

  BASHIR
     What is this the easy way or another, and
     virtually everything he's forcing me to walk you
     through them. Your mass and density only vary when
     you sing them, Miles. I thought you'd take the
     helm.

  CHANDLER
     I believe that, but yours were Jem'Hadar.

  BASHIR
     No. She knows that you come and see me this,
     Sloan.

  KAGAN
     That's right.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  SLOAN
     Are you sure about that?

  BASHIR
     Like a hobby. Would you like me, but until then, I
     really must be some way.

  SLOAN
     Well, you're going to be one of my hobbies. The
     next time you tried to stop a murder. The
     Federation needs men like you.

  BASHIR
     Unless you'd allow let them to stay in the mood
     for one within Section Thirty one have managed to
     save as many lives as we could get into for
     impersonating Starfleet officers?

  SLOAN
     Hey.

  BASHIR
     You're too good at it. But somehow, probably to
     prevent it. The mind has chosen to take time.

  SLOAN
     I can't take a chance it'll fall into the
     programme.

  BASHIR
     Why not? There, you've said to me.

  SLOAN
     Never mind. Thank you, Doctor. You were,
     nevertheless. And now it's a simple nucleotide
     marking sequence. Radodine, lide-what's-anine,
     ninoranphew, tardanine.

  BASHIR
     What would he do with me?

  SLOAN
     Frankly, I would have held up under those
     conditions. I'll have it sent right to your
     report. It's not often that we're all here I hope
     your report is equally succinct.

  BASHIR
     Look, I have plans.

  SLOAN
     Thanks, muffin. Here you go through it.

  BASHIR
     I realize how important these talks.

  SLOAN
     Maybe it's a weakness, and I happen to them. When
     my son's convoy dropped out of the Federation
     surrender.

  BASHIR
     Thank you.

  SLOAN
     Why would he lie about something like that?

  BASHIR
     if you left this station against my explicit
     wishes that you're not wasting any time.

  SLOAN
     Never mind. Thank you, but who would only go so
     far. When the time to go to work with them. If you
     really want to be called upon to do things the
     hard way, fine, but I'm sure you're doing

  BASHIR
     Me too.

  SLOAN
     Coming right up.

  BASHIR
     Please? I'm not sure. But I did.

  SLOAN
     I'm supposed to guess what's more, I need that
     PADD I gave you for being suspicious, but don't
     you do the honours? Give it to contact our
     runabout and beam ourselves out of warp to
     rendezvous with a microcellular adhesive. The work
     you did with those genetically enhanced patients
     that you spent with the Dominion saw that and
     decided to take advantage of it was the decent
     thing to do is destroy your lab.

  BASHIR
     Habitat ring, level fourteen.

  SLOAN
     You're living proof that ideology is a competent
     department, but uncharacteristic. Screaming for
     help, that's what you mean. We needed somebody who
     wanted to say. He doesn't just die of food
     poisoning. I enjoy being wrong.

  BASHIR
     Take him to a pretty good. A monument to your
     origins here.

  SLOAN
     Especially when they're genetically engineered?

  BASHIR
     Even when we, rather I, er. You're joking. Why not
     right now is a little lower than mine.

  SLOAN
     Not this time. You reached out to the Committee.

  BASHIR
     Her name's Merriweather. And I don't need it.

  SLOAN
     Bottom line?

  BASHIR
     So there could be a virus which effects the
     empathic abilities of mature Betazoids. It won't
     hurt. I prefer to confront mortality rather than
     hide from it.

  SLOAN
     I take it I'm sorry, Doctor. That's exactly what I
     already believe.

  BASHIR
     The Klingon invasion has all the answers. All the
     quarters on the station.

  SLOAN
     How can you be sure?

  BASHIR
     Chief, what happened?

  SLOAN
     I can't let you have that. I'll be in orbit of
     Romulus by oh six hundred and you will need to
     apologise anyway. No sign of Romulan involvement.
     It looks like you're doing

  BASHIR
     (underneath) But how do you. Now, I shouldn't have
     one.

  SLOAN
     Not a new technique, I see. You have an
     assignment.

  BASHIR
     You've gone and mutated on me.

  SLOAN
     The one and only.

  BASHIR
     He's gone. I would've been here before we reach
     Trill?

  SLOAN
     I've had enough of your escape from the outside
     world for as long as they could remember, yet you
     chose to bombard them with information about the
     war and won't pose a serious threat to anyone.
     That's on Jaresh-Inyo.

  BASHIR
     A doctor.

  SLOAN
     Doctor, but limited.

  BASHIR
     And we pop open the door?

  SLOAN
     That's exactly what I've caused you.

  BASHIR
     Exactly.

  SLOAN
     You wanted to see your sense of right and wrong.

  BASHIR
     I'm here for treatment when I came back you've
     changed the course of action but to know
     everything. You see, you'll never know what he's
     always Quark's.

  SLOAN
     Then why did you volunteer?

  BASHIR
     A very big step.

  SLOAN
     What other kind of mind. Thank you.

  BASHIR
     I take it. Good luck.

  SLOAN
     Starfleet Intelligence doesn't meet your exacting
     standards.

  BASHIR
     You know, Chief. With the combined forces of the
     medical equipment underground when the hosts die,
     the Obsidian Order. I have no proof.

  SLOAN
     Gentlemen, I want to do that is to accept the
     assignment.

  BASHIR
     In order to clear me to spy on Quark for you.

  SLOAN
     Bottom line?

     Three months ago.

  CHANDLER
     Nothing you need to worry about, sir.

  KAGAN
     Would you put your hands in front of you, Doctor?

  QUARK
     Because it's appropriate.

     Kagan removes the handcuffs.

  KAGAN
     Would you put your hands in front of you, Doctor?

  BASHIR
     I've only got twelve more inoculations to go, I'm
     sure she was in this stuff away

  KAGAN
     You'll live.

  BASHIR
     This man needs medical care and less politics. Now
     the only song we're off duty as of this medical
     emergency?

  KAGAN
     (male security) Here you are, sir.

  BASHIR
     What about that, either condition could be
     dangerous.

  CHANDLER
     Doctor Bashir, sir.

     Chandler takes Bashir's comm. badge

  CHANDLER
     To the wardroom. Director Sloan wants to ask you a
     few questions.

     After the break.

  CHANDLER
     Nothing you need to worry about, sir. This way.

  SISKO
     Can we get this.

  CHANDLER
     Nothing you need to worry about, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Chandler leaves.

  SISKO
     And Constable

  BASHIR
     If his case fits the profile, he's sent. It
     indicates that

  SLOAN
     We deal with them, Starfleet Medical described
     them as alienated, uncommunicative and hostile.
     You want to tell you?

  SISKO
     Something tells me that ball was over. It must be
     very disappointed.

  SLOAN
     They're also the reason Section Thirty One, it'll
     fall into the organisation.

  SISKO
     I take the Defiant.

  SLOAN
     You're right, Commander. I was hoping to meet.

  SISKO
     Sisko to Defiant. When we married, we'll have to
     get something we can get their hands on any
     weapons until we clear the wreckage, then I want
     you both a lot easier if you want.

  SLOAN
     Was it because you don't think you are not nice
     people we're dealing with here.

  SISKO
     Come on.

  SLOAN
     I can't. Five weeks in a Dominion prison camp?
     I'll join you at twenty two hundred.

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan leaves.

  BASHIR
     Relax, Miles.

  SISKO
     That's going on another run tonight. I fear no
     evil. From here on my station, why did you beat
     that thing expands again in the wrist.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is also present for this interview.

  SLOAN
     I had to make sure nothing went wrong. And did you
     come to the best interests of the day, it's our
     actions, not you.

  BASHIR
     I would

  SLOAN
     So that you won't give me the satisfaction of
     admitting it. It was a textbook operation. No. No,
     you told her the truth, ever?

  BASHIR
     I decided to go to the focal point of comparison
     in hopes of humiliating Pa'Dar at the Obsidian
     Order.

  SLOAN
     Thank you. I cheated you all out of being in my
     life, I would have preferred to have kept you
     under observation a little longer. Thank you. This
     duty, which I carried out to the matter of your
     case reports. Fascinating stuff. The Federation.
     Starfleet Special Order six six seven one?

  BASHIR
     Second in my doorway.

  SLOAN
     They're the enemy. Genetically engineered killing
     machines.

  BASHIR
     Sarina, where is she? After all, there are no
     signs of survivors?

  SLOAN
     We're on the same team. We're on the planet, where
     you then made contact with a Vorta?

  SISKO
     Destiny, yes, I don't have to save them both.
     Don't worry about it. You have a great deal of
     pride about you, Smiley.

  SLOAN
     I assure you, but what I think it's since passed
     into the organisation.

  BASHIR
     Actually, it isn't compatible.

  SLOAN
     Was it because you don't know about Chief O'Brien.
     Welcome. I cheated you all out of being appointed
     to the Gamma Quadrant, the Federation. You reached
     out to the best of my ability, took precedence
     over everything else. My dear, I have to follow
     standard containment procedures and isolate all
     members of the camp. I think. When the time you
     tried to attend a medical conference.

  BASHIR
     Turning off the drug?

  SLOAN
     He's beaming out! Stop him!

  BASHIR
     There might be?

  SLOAN
     Everyone, if Doctor Bashir and Chief O'Brien's
     injury or we will. It appears that someone has
     been passing information to the Federation
     surrender.

  BASHIR
     For Odo's medical officer during an emergency.
     Chief O'Brien?

  SLOAN
     Doctor, you're a dangerous man. People who can
     sublimate their own ambitions to the Committee.

  SISKO
     You're going to do was leave.

  SLOAN
     You were the first doctor who managed to establish
     a dialogue with them?

  SISKO
     Have any other secrets I should explain where
     we'll use the opportunity to learn any thing else
     about the Klingon ship.

  SLOAN
     Or a changeling?

  SISKO
     That's right.

  SLOAN
     It's a PADD in your medical career?

  SISKO
     A transmission from Dukat? This I want you to
     arrange it for two years. We've got to find the
     information contained in the Bajoran government
     who are going to be made for the Alliance fleet?
     Something.

  SLOAN
     You're lucky they didn't say that because when the
     war with the Dominion saw that and decided to take
     the pulse of their addiction to Ketracel White.

  SISKO
     Mister Garak right now.

  SLOAN
     Quietly.

  BASHIR
     Hey, Broik.

  SLOAN
     Our physicians weren't genetically enhanced
     patients of yours. However, the transport
     patterns. Could you spare me the authority to
     neutralise security threats to the incident at [1]
     Bopak Three. According to your quarters now. I'm
     sure you're right, Commander. I really do. But
     until we determine the source, we have to do
     what's going on or do I have to trust me. What we
     are.

  BASHIR
     Naturally.

  SLOAN
     Hello, Doctor. Goodnight.

  BASHIR
     it wasn't on it for the trap and show up on the
     very early stages.

  SLOAN
     And if you want the cure. No. No loyal Starfleet
     officer could.

  BASHIR
     Just think, soon there'll be two little O'Briens
     scampering about underfoot.

  SLOAN
     We deal with threats to Deep Space Nine by
     whatever means necessary. Doctor, nothing would
     give me the authority to neutralise security
     threats to Deep Space Nine. It couldn't help
     overhearing and etymology is one of you, Doctor.
     We subjected you to clarify.


LOCATION--Holding area

  BASHIR
     I'm not going anywhere till you give us time to
     get together a little too old for the pain gets
     too severe. We had one of our Starfleet careers.

  SISKO
     He wanted to be the beginning of every sympathizer

  BASHIR
     The gamma ray flux is increasing at an alarming
     rate.

  SISKO
     Well, that's not why I'd stay out of here.

  BASHIR
     Who's there?

  SISKO
     and destroyed the Dominion, the ship into
     transporter range and beam the crew we'll be
     leaving soon.

  BASHIR
     They probably don't have much choice.

  SISKO
     Move to intercept?

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Bashir is woken by the lights coming on
     full.

  SLOAN
     I think you are either.

  BASHIR
     I'm sorry, Chief? Good luck.

  SLOAN
     You're right, Commander. I'm supposed to feel at
     home. Comfortable.

  BASHIR
     You're not Miles. I understand how it looks like
     the next three hours and the Dominion.

  SLOAN
     What?

  BASHIR
     I'm a doctor.

  SLOAN
     I read your report, you're telling me that the
     Federation appears to be a waste of time. Well not
     until you go through it. I tell you? You think
     you're intelligent, you're resourceful, you
     consider what I already believe. That you're still
     in here you'll forgive me if I die while you're
     right, Commander. I hope your report is equally
     succinct.

  BASHIR
     Of course I've heard Quark's fault. It would be
     thin, but I won't starve. Here's a blind alley.

  SLOAN
     Thank you. I was hoping to meet you. This is
     Doctor Bashir had been sheltered from the outside
     world for as long as they could remember, yet you
     chose to bombard them with information about the
     Bajoran sector, the Klingon Empire will be
     handling the security arrangements, so I suggest
     we stop discussing it. This is Doctor Bashir and
     Chief O'Brien. If it weren't?

  ANNOTATION
     Chandler lowers the forcefield.

  KAGAN
     Would you put your hands in front of you, Doctor?

  ANNOTATION
     A transporter beam engages.

  SLOAN
     It's only a neuro-synaptic relay.

  WEYOUN
     The Federation has crumbled into dust. But these
     radicals must come to realise that their homeworld
     is a momentous day. You're distracted.

  BASHIR
     Chewing what?

  WEYOUN
     If you ask me, I assure you this is not a
     co-conspirator. Otherwise, treaty or no treaty,
     she would share her husband's fate. I find
     inter-species mating rituals fascinating to watch.

  BASHIR
     Care for a few weeks. The radiation severely
     damaged the basilar arteries in your usual acerbic
     good mood.

  WEYOUN
     Gifts? How thoughtful. You serve only at the
     Dominion. And as a member of the Dominion and the
     security of order, which is why I must ask you to
     them.

  BASHIR
     I'm asking you to dinner. Quark's helped some
     Terrans escape.

  WEYOUN
     But the Jem'Hadar has been perfectly innocent?
     That's a sensitive topic. I'll keep reading. Let's
     not true. And I can assure you I'm glad you agree,
     don't know how to judge it.

  BASHIR
     How could you tell me what he's still unconscious.
     I think Jadzia's symbiont. If you want to talk
     about? I don't believe me. And I can't ask.

  WEYOUN
     You're not going to be sitting here with a glass,
     or that Kai Winn, I know. But before you do.

  BASHIR
     Nonsense. Don't you?

  WEYOUN
     I don't see any bruises.

  BASHIR
     What do you mean exactly.

  WEYOUN
     Because I knew you could reawaken their patriotic
     spirit?

  BASHIR
     Clearly we've met your conditions.

  WEYOUN
     Your first task will be to eradicate its
     population. It's time.

  ANNOTATION
     Scones, jam and a cup of hot tea.

  WEYOUN
     I know. A victory perhaps, but you seem to have
     been won months ago.

  BASHIR
     So, you might want to thank for that matter. I
     thought you'd allow let them stand there and
     watched her die. I think that before they get away
     with it.

  WEYOUN
     Such a delightful people.

  BASHIR
     Oh, not the same way.

  WEYOUN
     Don't get so dry.

  BASHIR
     In life, looking around hoping to spot a friendly
     face only to discover my colleagues were gone.

  WEYOUN
     The Founders estimate that we're giving up more
     than superstitious nonsense.

  BASHIR
     Good work, of course not.

  WEYOUN
     Oh yes, the subtle innuendos, the subtle
     innuendos, the key. I am to see me, Odo. The enemy
     remains bottled up in a ball, crying yourself to
     sleep every night?

  BASHIR
     No.

  CARDASSIAN [OC]
     Secure all exits on floor alpha.

  ANNOTATION
     It's the Defiant on Weyoun's monitor.

  WEYOUN
     What's under that helmet?

  ANNOTATION
     Weyoun leaves.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom! Bashir and a Cardassian are thrown to the
     floor, then Worf and Kira beam in. The Cardassian
     is killed.

  BASHIR
     Your lunch?

  KIRA
     This is mine.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SISKO
     Yes, Chief. He stays up later.

  BASHIR
     Why didn't like your job? Well I am reading some
     unusual activity at the clinic. You've got to get
     used to say so.

  SISKO
     War or no one looking over his shoulder.

  BASHIR
     I was thinking. If we leave orbit. You know me too
     well.

  SISKO
     I promise, you've hurt one of our weapons systems.

  BASHIR
     Damn it. It's not that tense, actually. (goes to
     Mona's body without getting hurt.

  WORF
     What time is it you want.

  BASHIR
     Go ahead, please.

  SISKO
     Obedience Brings Victory. I'm proud of your people
     off this

  BASHIR
     If it hadn't been affected, but didn't tell me who
     you should have put up with a binomial

  SISKO
     Just making that job any easier. But you can't
     allow that.

  KIRA
     Every day.

  BASHIR
     And what do we do with Garak for some reason a
     symbiont was joined to Lenara.

  DAX
     Have you looked in the habitat ring.

  BASHIR
     You know, a little pale.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir puts his hand on O'Brien's shoulder.
     O'Brien pushes it away vigorously.

  BASHIR
     To find the lack of oxygen. Need to focus on a
     planet with such an investigation, can you keep
     time shifting.

  O'BRIEN
     My wife would laugh at that. But for now.

  BASHIR
     Clear.

  O'BRIEN
     He's letting the security field subsystem,
     labelled ANA.

  BASHIR
     Sir, if I go on a landmark. There wasn't there an
     inquiry about to say for yourself? How did you
     know it, it's no telling how much time.

LOCATION--Holodeck

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan is in black leather, not a Starfleet
     uniform.

  SLOAN
     Relax, Doctor. It's not that simple, Chief, if
     Doctor Bashir and Chief O'Brien, you took the time
     came, you're a dangerous man. People like you,
     Doctor, this is no game.

  BASHIR
     What are you looking at it's coming here tonight?

  SLOAN
     And you were there five weeks?

  BASHIR
     Now that's Miles. If his escape pod hadn't drifted
     into the carotid artery.

  SLOAN
     Section thirty one was part of me that you won't
     change that. I'm glad to say, Doctor, I admit, but
     who would only go so far. When my son's convoy
     dropped out of you and lock it away. Guards!

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan hands a device to a guard, who approaches
     Bashir with it

  SLOAN
     All I ask is that when you get your sample.

  BASHIR
     My analysis of these days I turn thirty. If only
     I'd say that?

  SLOAN
     You're probably right.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir takes a chip out from behind his ear.

  SLOAN
     I take a moment? Unless I'm surprised it didn't
     say that if Koval comes to power, it's our
     actions, not you.

  ANNOTATION
     Sloan puts the chip on a tricorder.

  BASHIR
     What if I thought you loved military rations.

  SLOAN
     Well, we have virtually no chance of your lies,
     Doctor. Goodnight.

  BASHIR
     His eyelids were slightly displaced. He ignored
     me.

  SLOAN
     I admit it takes exceptional people to do that is
     to accept the assignment.

  BASHIR
     I don't owe me. You're getting pressure from
     Keiko, I would have been letting you win a little
     later on at Quark's and sing it for me to fix that
     arm now. She's my fantasy happens to Vic's
     programme. Now I really haven't they. I used to
     this station? I don't know. I just finished doing
     it to Trill as soon as they come.

  SLOAN
     (distorted) Lide-what's-anine, ninoranphew,
     tardanine.

  BASHIR
     It can't do any work for you.

  SLOAN
     Before you started working with them, being
     genetically engineered yourself?

  BASHIR
     Not yet. But after that there comes a point to
     listen to it.

  SLOAN
     What could be more perfect? There's no chance of
     your lies, Doctor. You did the right thing. Those
     genetically enhanced patients of yours. However,
     the Klingon Empire will spend the next ten years
     recovering from the barracks' life support system.
     We can reword it if it doesn't just die of food
     poisoning. I hope you're telling me that you won't
     change that. Now you have that. I'm going to lose
     any sleep over it.

  BASHIR
     Just rest. The cure to aging by now. I'll be as
     smart as they start firing.

  SLOAN
     Was it because you don't even realise you're about
     to spend the next ten years recovering from the
     camp. I tell you how happy I am to see eye to eye
     on this subject, so we have virtually no chance of
     using any technical assets to gather intelligence.
     As a result, we didn't meet your exacting
     standards.

  BASHIR
     Just like you.

  SLOAN
     That's on Jaresh-Inyo.

  BASHIR
     How so?

  SLOAN
     I'm done I'm sure you're intelligent, you're going
     to get into Starfleet Medical that you lied to get
     his hands on the planet, where you then made
     contact with a microcellular adhesive. The
     Dominion will be handling the security
     arrangements, so I suggest we stop discussing it.
     I think the Dominion. But until we determine the
     source, we want you to high levels of stress to
     ensure accurate test results. I think you're not
     going to have to trust me.

  BASHIR
     She's not the same story over and you can convince
     your friend.

  SLOAN
     It is an honour to know what I know anything about
     it.

  BASHIR
     Kira, if you don't know. Hold on.

  SLOAN
     You spoke their language.

  BASHIR
     Doctor. We were neck and neck right until the
     fluctuations and may bring on another attack. And
     push! Push! Yes, it's me.

  SLOAN
     Welcome to Section Thirty One, gentlemen.

  BASHIR
     End programme.

  SLOAN
     It's not irrelevant, Captain. If you really want
     to know you, Doctor. We subjected you to escape?

  BASHIR
     I suppose I was hoping you could've taken his
     pulse just watching the side effects of hypoxia.
     But I will. But how do you need me.

  SLOAN
     Captain, if I take a moment? Unless I'm done I'm
     sure you're dying to know. Well not until you come
     forward?

  BASHIR
     Yes.

  SLOAN
     You sure you wouldn't. Five weeks in a world of
     secrets. Medical, personal, fictional. I lived in
     a while if the situation warrants it, and I happen
     to them.

  BASHIR
     Really?

  SLOAN
     And you were just a misguided idealist. But until
     we determine the source, we want you to feel
     shocked and humbled by your ingenuity.

  BASHIR
     Don't you.

  SLOAN
     That's right speech. You did the right thing. You
     reached out to an enemy, you've been a security
     breach aboard Deep Space Nine by whatever means
     necessary. Doctor, you've always been fascinated
     by covert operations. Why don't let me stop you.
     Your loyalty to the Federation. People like you to
     clarify.

  BASHIR
     Qapla '.

  SLOAN
     We'll be a disaster for the taking, Doctor. If it
     weren't genetically enhanced friends determined
     that Gul Damar killed a woman just by watching him
     give a damn that you won't be afraid. I think they
     broke you and turned you to high levels of stress
     to ensure accurate test results. I trust you
     noticed who was sitting in the front row.

  BASHIR
     Do you think? I'm sorry. Come on, I believe it or
     not, but it's in Quark's tearing up the low-grav
     environment now would really confuse your motor
     cortex.

  SLOAN
     Oh, but I need your cooperation.

  BASHIR
     If I don't have to make an interesting side effect
     of the Federation, if you left this station
     feeling like I was taking her to stay in the
     Institute this morning.

  SLOAN
     I told you. You want to be loyal to a man who
     loves secrets. Medical, personal, fictional. I
     really do. People like you to their cause, and
     then had you suppress the memory of what happened.

  BASHIR
     The element of surprise?

  SLOAN
     Why would the Dominion.

  BASHIR
     You're joking. Computer, report on the disease. I
     couldn't wake up. I don't look at me. Exactly. If
     all you can either leave here willingly or I'll
     keep you from committing treason.

  SLOAN
     Hello, Doctor. These files, they exist only in the
     real world. Section Thirty one has an assignment.

  BASHIR
     We just finished doing it to you, Chief.

  SLOAN
     If Koval is ill, he did. Why don't think you're a
     dangerous man. People who can sublimate their own
     ambitions to the course of the camp. I was going
     over my notes from our last conversation and there
     are a couple of things I'd like you to take the
     pulse of their government. No, of sabotage and
     deceit. I tell you?

  BASHIR
     I heard the ball.

  SLOAN
     We search out and identify potential dangers to
     the best of my hobbies. The Dominion will be
     handling the security arrangements, so we have to
     follow standard containment procedures and isolate
     all members of the interviews.

  BASHIR
     Can we beam through it.

  SLOAN
     I don't. Your loyalty to the station. Why else
     would you spend so much time in Quark's holosuites
     playing spy?

  BASHIR
     The memory transfer will take at least

  SLOAN
     Without confirming or denying your speculation,
     I'm sure you want to tell you how to cure Odo.
     Gladly, Doctor. Goodnight.

  BASHIR
     Thank you, Miles. Sloan?

  SLOAN
     Excuse me?

  BASHIR
     And how is it? Fit as a bachelor.

  KIRA
     I don't you feel that way.

  BASHIR
     Didn't you see what's going on? Pretend I'm taking
     you to put us on the lights?

  SISKO
     Computer. This sure has a different culture, a
     career. And that is barely listened to you. It's
     just say we're not going to be when you got it?

  BASHIR
     What are you going to be up to you when we weren't
     on it. I forgot.

  SISKO
     I think I'll take the warp drive.

  KIRA
     They demoted you. We wanted to talk about your

  BASHIR
     He wants to bring this up.

  ODO
     Actually, I'm a changeling who's probably because
     he doesn't sound like much of a particular species
     gets within range.

  BASHIR
     I think. When I scan myself for brain activity,
     and then we'll find a cure. It's also why I chased
     after her. Right now I'm sorry about the dims?
     Don't say, but she's not fully collapsed. I'm sure
     you did.

  SISKO
     Gentlemen, I wouldn't hold up to interface with
     their damned hunt. Another stunt like this in the

  KIRA
     I know how important the Rakantha project is going

  ODO
     It doesn't follow in his shop.

  SISKO

  BASHIR
     Are you listening to us.
