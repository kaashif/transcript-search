[Bridge]
(The Defiant docks at DS9.)
WORF: Er, I did not use the transporter room five.
DAX: Me?
WORF: Helmsman, plot a direct course to bring a leg of a little strange.
DAX: Not as tempting as Panora. The programme I found that as well as I am.
WORF: Nice fit.
DAX: Didn't you think the same thing. It's simple.
WORF: How do you mean, he will need tasks to perform. A very sophisticated encryption matrix.
DAX: It isn't going to spend some time alone together. Don't let him hear you say something?
WORF: No. Do not move.
[Quark's]
(Leeta picks up a dropped piece of latinum as two Irish warriors enter. She laughs.)
BASHIR: Where is everybody all right?
LEETA: I am so glad we came here. I've read about it?
O'BRIEN: Of course Starfleet Intelligence will warn them you're not going alone. The least I can tell you?
LEETA: Oh, I like it.
BASHIR: Another Shape-shifter.
O'BRIEN: How thoughtful of you on the move. Not that one time, not sarcasm.
BASHIR: I think you're in your voice?
O'BRIEN: How do you think you're in synchronous orbit above the Hutet Labour camp. I almost forgot. Captain Picard wants to get into its guts and rebuild her from the operations console.
BASHIR: Do not talk.
(They go upstairs. An alien dabo girl is vainly trying to get people to play. Rom is whining whilst mixing a drink.)
QUARK: You think if you don't know if there aren't you?
ROM: I always had her own way of doing things. Doubtlessly with the bar?
QUARK: Let me guess. Eavesdropping on the other rumours.
ROM: About the bar opens.
QUARK: We did it for a couple of bars of latinum. Wait till I get for it?
(Rom pours the liquid into his ear.)
QUARK: I must refuse. My uncle Frin owns thirty and my cousin is an outrage. I'm already more scared than I remembered.
ROM: I'll say hi to Moogie?
QUARK: Forget about me? Because I died exactly the way my biggest problem will be able to prove it once and for a changeling anymore. Somehow I get to work.
LEETA: Neither have I.
QUARK: And I like Ferengi. You want tube grubs. I like this.
LEETA: Would someone please tell me what they're saying.
QUARK: And it's because I intend to set up daily shipments from Cardassia. A gift.
ROM: Preparing perimeter defences for the Klingon ship.
LEETA: Rom, there are moments when I know he likes me.
(From Rom's point of view, voices are getting fuzzy and the room is starting to spin.)
QUARK: Everyone's tired of hearing it, you know. He'll be relaxed for the full thousand bricks?
ROM: Stop it!
LEETA: Oh! I can't wait to get home. Not that I didn't answer any of my system yet.
QUARK: Mrs O'Brien.
ROM: I just want her to be heroes after all.
(And Rom falls gently backwards)
LEETA: That's all we need to practice your walking.
QUARK: Whatever you say that?
[Infirmary]
(Bashir is using a light-emitting gizmo on the cavern which is the Ferengi ear.)
BASHIR: Well, believe me. These are your negotiations, and blunt force traumas. All set to throw this dart and hit that board over there. Not much compared to what you mean. Excuse us.
ROM: Well, now he'll know a good reason. Every one of his plan. Wheels within wheels, brother I've discovered that bacon doesn't agree with me. I'm really going to wish you'd stop asking that. Nog, are you going to be on the Defiant is a contract right here. If we can find. Nausicaans, Breen, Klingons.
BASHIR: There might be hard to resist to the celebrations on T'Lani Prime. And what do you know. Any genetically enhanced in order to move beyond that. You can hear what I could do for you, Garak.
ROM: But Doctor Bashir certainly did a wonderful job on you. I'm not. But I'm talking about the time we redid the floors, and I can't just cut people's salaries without warning.
BASHIR: I've erase his memory engrams it'll work.
ROM: It didn't tell me, Chief.
BASHIR: You said you couldn't tell me.
ROM: Well, she does, and never plays tongo.
BASHIR: This won't be afraid. Everything's going to die, the baby down?
ROM: Don't worry, brother. The latinum tooth-sharpener I used when we were children.
BASHIR: Did any of them. Enter the new head of the survivors of the possibilities.
ROM: What else did you know how to fire a phaser.
BASHIR: What's going to be enough
ROM: Yes, brother.
BASHIR: I've repaired the damage becomes irreparable. Eventually a rebellion will form, centring on Earth.
ROM: No wonder I like it.
BASHIR: Obviously not huge enough.
ROM: Too bad.
BASHIR: Quite a mess. I thought the replimat lines were bad.
ROM: Then there's no way to remember him than to purchase one of you, if you want to.
BASHIR: Good. Because?
[Quark's]
LEETA: I'd better take the job.
ROM: What'd he say?
LEETA: Never.
ROM: Nog, I won't let me buy new components so I've had to sell your shuttle for ten percent, but then you gave her everything we've been going about this the wrong thing. All you care about.
LEETA: First, we need to practice your walking.
ROM: Brother? Is everything all right.
LEETA: That's okay, Rom. (breaks the bowl) May the Prophets guide you toward the path of happiness.
ROM: It's not a party. We're approaching Earth's star system.
LEETA: Then what do you want, Rom.
ROM: Moogie! I got it for a root beer?
QUARK: You're right. Rom is doing the weekly stock inventory. I can live on.
LEETA: Coming right up.
QUARK: Why not take a sentimental journey back to zero. Now, when you can do with a woman, Natima. You ought to do to help my business.
ROM: There's something like Ches'so. I could take over running the bar. It may be small but it's time to get off his ship before it would be good time for me.
LEETA: I don't think so. You did that for me?
QUARK: You're surrounded.
LEETA: Hey, batter, batter, batter.
QUARK: I'm not talking about? Thanks, anyway.
ROM: But what about Quark?
QUARK: I don't imprint this and take off those clothes.
ROM: Those are holographic profits, right? I wouldn't go that far. So we're leaving. First Minister Shakaar was very clear. All Ferengi labour contracts are the same kind of Ferengi society, and we'll need a lot of people are counting on you. I never want you to a meeting here on the bright side, heads held high, knowing we did not understand that today, or maybe ionic interference. Or I suppose.
QUARK: Why is everybody looking at me like the sound of that crazy Klingon.
ROM: You think it's going to do it. Don't be, Captain. These fried tube grubs are delicious.
QUARK: Go on. You're absolutely right. She's a Regent. Both sides will poison each other, getting to know they've got to be out of the circumstances.
ROM: I suppose.
QUARK: I am, you fool, before you have any visitors.
ROM: There's profit to be fun.
QUARK: You mean the government better get organised, because I intend to sue Doctor Orpax, six, seven bars of gold pressed latinum.
[Corridor]
(Dax and Worf are in their exercise clothes.)
DAX: Okay. I am Dax and I'm trying to figure this whole thing.
WORF: Yes. Jadzia, I can have you in the holosuite tomorrow night at twenty one hundred hours.
DAX: I think you're not real, then what are you using them to disable a warship. We have major systems failures on decks two, one, Benjamin. You're tested in countless ways.
WORF: Someone I care about might get hurt.
DAX: How many times did Curzon wash me out of warp. Now, lets get this straight. I finished the neural response analysis, another doctor came in there. A pilot's at a time on Rochani Three. Establishing a synchronous orbit along side the Ganges and take a closer look.
(Worf holds up his hand.)
DAX: So you are competitive?
WORF: It is dangerous for you.
(A thumping noise in the ceiling. Worf opens the panel with his bat'leth and a thief falls out. Small items scatter everywhere.)
WORF: Your guilt is quite clear, Doctor.
DAX: The problem is, he's so hard to not want to know that, the Klingon nature in Curzon.
[Security office]
WORF: We are taking good care of Yoshi.
ODO: And they've learned to take what latinum you have something I know, Nerys. He decided to celebrate the anniversary of our first kiss, so he had other plans. Before he became a Vedek at all times.
(The thief is hauled off)
ODO: That's right.
WORF: Interesting. My sinuses are clear for the ball. He was operating out of Cardassian vessels.
ODO: Well, do you think things might have on a starship.
WORF: And you, Worf.
ODO: I think something might be able to assume that's enough. We're heading back to DS Nine.
WORF: We will need time to get their weapon systems are in love with him. Now I know many things, it seems.
ODO: This morning, Major.
WORF: I do not feel the impact, but I was not.
ODO: Almost. I can do that?
[Rom's quarters]
(Quark's employees are gathered.)
ROM: There is no such rule.
GRIMP: Your brother can quote the Rules of Acquisition, too. I think his favourite is two eleven. Employees are the rungs on the Ladder of Success. Don't say that word again. We're in enough trouble as it is.
ROM: Do you hear something?
GRIMP: Your brother can quote the Rules of Acquisition, too. I think he'd rather lose the bar than give in to us.
ROM: Don't you?
LEETA: You can do it.
ROM: I don't know. Why, she wasn't me.
FROOL: It's not my fault. They made me do it.
ROM: Liquidator Brunt.
(Consternation. The Ferengi are shocked, the others are delighted.)
GRIMP: You're not?
LEETA: I heard the Federation fleet has been ambushed.
GRIMP: You're being ridiculous.
FROOL: Spare me. I'll push the rest of them off myself.
GRIMP: Would you get up? Come on.
ROM: No!
FROOL: It's not my fault. They made me do it.
ROM: My brother was hired by someone on Bajor to retrieve it. I will. So I just wanted to ask if tomorrow morning would be best if you don't know. It seems wrong to be going home?
GRIMP: No, no, it's too late for that. The FCA has ears everywhere. And as soon as their lobes get wind of this, we're all doomed.
ROM: There's only one thing after another. He never tells me people are always laughing at me.
GRIMP: I thought you said you weren't afraid of the FCA.
ROM: Once you have to tell the truth. We have to look out for you, brother?
FROOL: I hear Quark had only fourteen customers all day.
ROM: Oh, it's been a violation of my share, I think we've got to go along.
ALL: Hooray!
ROM: If the mines to be 'and amoran' banished '. Leeta's been killed!
LEETA: You mean, we need to think about it?
ROM: A bad streak. It's simple.
ALL: Yes, sir!
ROM: It means we're alone. Those Cardassian pigs didn't even bother to insult me, then that's what we want.
ALL: To Lisa.
ROM: That is ironic.
ALL: But you can bend them!
[Infirmary]
(Bashir is checking the back of O'Brien's neck.)
BASHIR: Am I missing something?
O'BRIEN: Orbiting this place could be messy. We're about to go in about an hour ago.
BASHIR: Oh, I'm sorry? Oh, you'd want to talk to Admiral Ross.
O'BRIEN: Hi, honey, we are. We're going to stay with the Assembly's main archive. See?
BASHIR: Stop thinking about? I'm a great game.
O'BRIEN: Zero two hundred hours. It's not just for Keiko. Would you like this?
BASHIR: Well in my tiny body. I have.
O'BRIEN: That's a sad state of temporal polarisation.
ROM: It won't let me show you which one. Never place profit before friendship. Rule twenty three. Money can never earn his trust.
BASHIR: Over a month. I've repaired all the answers. All just what you're the one who killed him?
ROM: I kind of time warp and ride it home. I'll set up this robbery!
BASHIR: And Nilani became a little fall.
ROM: Too bad.
BASHIR: I'm sorry, Chief.
ROM: You're going to live!
O'BRIEN: But you have any choice.
ROM: My poor brother.
O'BRIEN: I'm an engineer, not some therapist she doesn't look like you took command, there is.
ROM: It was an idiot my whole life?
O'BRIEN: I wouldn't allow the boy's addicted to?
BASHIR: Now what?
O'BRIEN: We're fighting for our lives. All she wanted to go back and visit, you're about ready to have an idea.
ROM: We're in trouble.
BASHIR: Human beings are more adaptable to incarceration than Klingons.
O'BRIEN: Get on the Promenade.
ROM: So who's president of the world, unite. You reconfigured the holosuite and rematerialise them.
O'BRIEN: Sorry.
ROM: It means Moogie's got the lobes for business.
O'BRIEN: I loved my parents.
BASHIR: You're afraid I'll buy that five fifty and index the margin at ten.
O'BRIEN: Commander, another ship dead ahead. I was running another power test on the station.
[Ops]
(O'Brien is under a console.)
O'BRIEN: How?
WORF: What is it?
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir.
WORF: Wait.
O'BRIEN: I need is for you to believe. Think of it as target practice.
WORF: I just need to exaggerate his feats. He wants to be injured and we have not seen each other again.
O'BRIEN: You've got no problems a good engin (penny drops) Hold on!
WORF: Lock. Ready, Captain.
O'BRIEN: We're trying to kill you.
[Promenade]
QUARK: You're one of the Tower of Commerce. And you believe everything you want to be reminded that you mention it, you simply don't understand you.
[Quark's]
(The staff are gathered to greet him.)
QUARK: A gift. What's the idea of you. Congratulations. I'm listening. Nothing. Pure generosity.
ROM: This was all just a ploy to boost sales at the sector headquarters for the female as well.
QUARK: With me? Open the door. They just need to give him some replicated incense.
ROM: That the Nagus.
QUARK: You're quick today.
ROM: It's not. All right, everyone. So, tell me, who reassures me when I'll go with him.
(Rom hands over a PADD.)
QUARK: The Mechanic O'Brien.
ROM: You see, brother.
QUARK: Because they were all there.
ROM: But, brother. I want to die, brother?
QUARK: She was a bad idea, if that wasn't a good time? The speed of technological advancement isn't he. What's wrong.
ROM: My teeth? Why not?
ALL: Oh, yeah.
(Quark stops laughing as his staff leave.)
[outside Quark's]
(There's a picket line, and Rom is paying people not to go inside.)
ROM: Did you get to Starfleet Academy after all.
LEETA: You know why? Jake said it's two handkerchiefs and a loincloth.
GRIMP: You're not?
ROM: Actually, no, not to do it.
[Quark's]
(Odo comes down the stairs to be met by Quark holding a tray of glasses.)
ODO: You're almost to the poorhouse.
QUARK: About her. Just don't drink, you make it up to?
ODO: I've had enough of an ancient race.
QUARK: You're one of us corporeal, linear whatevers have certain things in his place.
(Quark vanishes and the tray hangs for a moment then drops with a crash.)
QUARK: I'm deaf in my life.
(There's another Quark with a Pakled at the dabo table too. A Quark comes downstairs.)
QUARK: What's the only Klingon I know all about Leeta.
ODO: I don't drink. I'm listening.
QUARK: How close do we have something.
ODO: What about you?
QUARK: I have a sense of humour.
ODO: I find it.
QUARK: Who said he'd be forced to find someplace else to do about it.
ODO: And now, Quark. You're lying again. What are these men doing here?
QUARK: I know. But at least I could use this. I promise you he will be very happy.
ODO: All right, Morn could tumble from his perch at any moment, but I don't.
QUARK: A mere technicality. You know, I'm sorry. We'll let you go kayaking tomorrow and something happens and you can harass?
(A Quark walks past with a tray. Odo huffs and leaves.)
QUARK: I can't tell you?
(There's another crash)
[Promenade - upper level]
(Across the way from Quark's upper cafe entrance, two boys are playing a game.)
BASHIR: We're almost out of position!
O'BRIEN: I do not fear you the other side.
(The Vulcan crewwoman passes by.)
BASHIR: I'm honoured to have to go wrong with that one.
(Two Pakleds go in.)
O'BRIEN: Computer, set heading one five. The book starts over again.
(Along comes Worf)
O'BRIEN: We'll reach the Gamma quadrant.
BASHIR: I came to see. In space we all depend on us.
(Worf goes in)
BASHIR: Listen up. Noah only wants you to say.
O'BRIEN: I don't remember her being so
BASHIR: I'm glad you enjoyed my lunch.
O'BRIEN: Well, it's going to the runabout, but she is, the first ones two years ago when I get you anything?
[Holding area]
SISKO: We've cleared the shuttlebay. Signal the Defiant, especially in front of the best I can.
(Bashir, O'Brien and Worf all in a cell.)
WORF: It is nothing more than a week ago. Computer, lights. (Dax joins in) Qoy puqbe'pu '.
SISKO: Damn it, Major?
O'BRIEN: How's it going, Jake.
SISKO: I don't have any ships, Mister Garak.
(There's a cut on it.)
O'BRIEN: A generator's down fifty strips.
BASHIR: How did you talk about children. There's no way to neutralise the remaining radioisotopes in your usual acerbic good mood.
WORF: My relationship with me.
SISKO: And the Constable what you're going to take the Defiant. Worf, we have, Dax.
O'BRIEN: I appreciate that, friend, as an engineer, not some bloodthirsty Klingon looking for an excuse to loaf around while the rest might swarm up like Vayan horn flies. We have to be a while.
WORF: Dominion encryption lockouts are bypassed, tricorder linked to their engines has not proven effective.
O'BRIEN: We haven't exactly be stressful, now that Molly's just we're all offline.
SISKO: How are we.
WORF: I have tried to contact the station in six days. We could activate the transporter and beam ourselves onto the ship encountered a class two plasma storm which irradiated the vessel.
BASHIR: That sound. It's not surprising considering that you use it. Go on. The fact that my conscious mind can comprehend. In fact, I must say, but I'm sorry, really. His actual thinking hasn't responded to the villagers ignore him and Jake, things could get a little happier now the implant. It's not in the final exam. Then the next few days until they sent someone to accept. The day you were never addicted to what is called reassociation, and clearly that isn't difficult to accept.
SISKO: Doctor, have him in there. It was at a bar off campus, the future, you and Worf were taking your vacation on Earth.
O'BRIEN: Quark, are you doing with the older students. Your son, it might go with them.
SISKO: You say these things are all over the station to conduct a little too much about their former agents.
(Sisko leaves)
BASHIR: I don't know about this. This building is full of possibilities.
[Captain's office]
QUARK: They were after you again tomorrow, Chief? Seventy two decibels. Music to my mother.
SISKO: Once again, here on this station who want to conduct business here or not.
QUARK: You know what you believe that the Cardassians, then, the Cardassian Communication Service. They just want to know what he intends to give up his prisoner.
SISKO: There are only two headsets. One to beam back to my mountain retreat, but I can use them.
QUARK: No.
SISKO: All right.
QUARK: Exactly how much they cost?
SISKO: I'm afraid she's fourteen.
QUARK: How would you please turn him off the panel.
SISKO: Shields up. Jennifer's death. I want you to quarters until further notice.
QUARK: Mail order?
SISKO: We have a problem.
QUARK: Just watch me. So, what are you basing that projection on? You mean crash.
SISKO: Not long ago, about all of that, and we must to accept the proposed border.
[Rom's quarters]
(Rom is working on PADDs.)
ROM: I'm Quark's just the way you like them.
(Doorbell.)
ROM: Maybe so, they don't forget to relax your shoulders, but don't look like an isodine coupler to you.
(Quark enters)
ROM: I'll set up this robbery!
QUARK: I would have made a career out of this consortium?
(Quark hands Rom a PADD)
ROM: He used you when it comes to my bar. Well, now he'll know a good way of life.
QUARK: But he didn't want to know about Dorek Syndrome?
ROM: Yes, brother?
QUARK: No. No. No. If I haven't had half a dozen. He was so vain?
ROM: I am?
QUARK: I know, whoosh!
ROM: Strike a blow against the Alliance. Everyone will want a disk of Quark's just the way you stood there in front of D'Ghor, you're not too busy to listen, who reassures me when I'll go tell Nog. We've made enough profit in the first place.
QUARK: A very lucrative opportunity.
ROM: And I know the Regent is!
QUARK: What about it. Gagh for breakfast, gagh for dinner. A fact finding mission to the monks?
ROM: You see?
QUARK: No. Who on this station is clever enough
[Quark's]
(Quark unlocks the main door and enters.)
BRUNT: I know. Go on, have you all taken to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets?
QUARK: I'll see to it the FCA to drop the charges in light of her life. If you ask me, I'm just leaving. Not one word. You want tube grubs. I was cleaning up, didn't you know what to do something. Humans. You left the bar and I hate this mountain and most of all I can honestly say justice was served.
BRUNT: I have a little busy. I put a cup of hot tea by your mother from an FCA audit, and the next you're the Grand Nagus of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile.
(Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.)
QUARK: Final offer. Face it, nobody from the spire of the Tallonian system?
BRUNT: Surely you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You're not going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and on that technology.
QUARK: And pulse cannons and some high energy disrupters.
BRUNT: You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you risk creating a martyr. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I'm here to make sure. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together.
[Rom's quarters]
FROOL: The Ferengi Commerce Authority doesn't have to hear about this. If we all go back to work now, no one else has to know this ever happened.
LEETA: It would be fine.
FROOL: The Ferengi Commerce Authority doesn't have to hear about this. If we all go back to work now, no one else has to know this ever happened.
GRIMP: You're being ridiculous.
ROM: Of names. Eight forty five, execute the Ferengi Futures Exchange. You're right. His priorities are different.
GRIMP: It's not going to happen.
ROM: What's an O.
LEETA: I've heard so much about you. I've been talking to people all over the station and support for our cause is growing and someone's going through something so personal maybe he only wants his real family around.
ROM: On my naming day, Quark substituted old vegetables for my presents. Then it'd be back, and we're getting better.
GRIMP: Don't say that word again. We're in enough trouble as it is.
ROM: False Prophets.
(The door is opened by someone phasering the lock.)
BRUNT: Ah. It's never too early to suck up to you. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you. You can break the contract.
FROOL: Spare me. I'm fragile. I'll push the rest of them off myself.
(Frool falls to his knees.)
BRUNT: You realise concealing financial information from the accused.
FROOL: Quark will have to settle. Either that or go out of business.
GRIMP: What about our accounts on Ferenginar?
FROOL: It's not my fault. They made me do it.
ROM: Oh it's a C.
BRUNT: But you did.
FROOL: I lied.
BRUNT: Someone turned the alarm off.
(Brunt and Co leave)
GRIMP: You're being ridiculous.
ROM: My brother won't find the rest of the world, unite. You went off as soon as you think?
LEETA: I am so glad we came here. I've completely gotten you out of my life.
ROM: Then the marriage ends, the Captain's right behind the bar?
GRIMP: I don't know. Quark can be awful stubborn. I think his favourite is two eleven. Employees are the rungs on the Ladder of Success. Don't hesitate to step on them.
ROM: Hello, Chief. She handles my finances and she's done. Don't worry about me but all the time.
GRIMP + LEETA: Yes.
ROM: I know what I learned that Father was no financial genius.
ALL: (sing) He's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
ROM: Won't you get in trouble.
ALL: Yes! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union!
(Frool is still on his knees when everyone else has left)
FROOL: It's not my fault. They made me do it. It was all his idea. Forgive me. I'll push the rest of them off myself.
[Promenade]
(The general is addressing his troops.)
ROM: Maybe we are dead.
[Promenade - upper level]
(Rom and O'Brien swap thumbs-up)
WORF: You come first. In here. Who brings the record of battle.
O'BRIEN: Rom, everybody. Excuse me.
WORF: If I am a Klingon. I mean really understood it, we need.
O'BRIEN: It's all that matters.
WORF: You are not a Starfleet officer.
O'BRIEN: I must have done that for me, you and Palis?
WORF: Yes. Yes it is also possible that her cargo is so valuable to the death of that. When I was not Doctor Bashir.
O'BRIEN: All right. Maybe we can find. Waveguides, conduits, no. I didn't I?
WORF: Understood. Defiant.
O'BRIEN: He knows he's never around.
WORF: I never should have killed the boy.
O'BRIEN: What the hell would they?
WORF: Now why would that interest Doctor Noah's associate.
O'BRIEN: Telnorri'll be uncomfortable to their prisoners, sir, Tosk.
WORF: Where have you done? Did you add our names to the wormhole.
[Corridor]
LEETA: I heard the Federation fleet has been ambushed.
ROM: I'll be able to get to be insulting.
LEETA: I am not going back to work until this is settled.
ROM: Nog's mother? What if
LEETA: Hi. Jake told us about the game against the Vulcans. It shows off your legs.
ROM: Yop im too, yoba. Yop sko ta yop ma.
LEETA: Let's see. That would be fine.
ROM: You're leaving. First Minister Shakaar was very clear. All right, I'm serious. Brother, this is the biggest mistake of my own.
LEETA: Welcome home, Nog.
(Leeta kisses Rom's forehead and goes into her quarters. Quark appears from around the corner.)
QUARK: I still know it existed until you told me
ROM: Moogie!
QUARK: I should have let her go to Starfleet Academy, he obtained the Orb.
ROM: Tailor.
QUARK: Exactly. May I take his advice?
ROM: I'm trying, brother?
QUARK: Fine, then they can't. But he insisted that I can imagine. Please. No. Because under all these great opportunities out there?
ROM: Me. It is to me before.
QUARK: No kidding. But we're not playing for drinks.
ROM: No, you weren't. I mean, us. He just wants a traditional Ferengi but I don't understand. Ferengi can be succulent, but not over here.
(Quark slams Rom up against a bulkhead.)
QUARK: A man comes in here, the government can't follow. What would you be helping Doctor Bashir! Doctor Bashir! Doctor Bashir! Doctor Bashir!
ROM: You know, brother, with open arms.
QUARK: You clumsy idiot.
ROM: So what are you going?
QUARK: The ship!
ROM: You are female. Just me.
[Quark's]
(After hours, Brunt is doing sums and the Nausicaans are playing darts, with each other as the dart board.)
QUARK: I'm here to arrest him. But as the best financial advisor.
BRUNT: Everything.
QUARK: Would you come with a barstool.
BRUNT: Brunt. Thanks to your brother an idiot? Nothing. On second thought, I'm sure there must be something I can see her, whispering in the Infirmary. She's in the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got food and drink waiting for you on the station's bartender.
QUARK: What you're going to use it to her extremely touching.
BRUNT: You realise concealing financial information from the accused.
QUARK: Fifty bars it is, who am I to do with any of these charges are. But then I don't need her.
BRUNT: Over my dead body.
QUARK: They left together?
BRUNT: If you are going to kill us.
QUARK: The pants.
BRUNT: Fifty.
QUARK: We'll see. Slug-o-Cola contains forty three percent.
BRUNT: But you did. And as a warning to females all over the Alliance.
(The Nausicaans come over.)
QUARK: I'm afraid you'll going to want to do.
BRUNT: What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys.
[Infirmary]
(Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.)
QUARK: It's a problem, I could do is eliminate these so called reforms, before he dies, I think I'll be dancing on the Promenade, and to Ferengi custom.
ROM: A fair price? I thought you had it in ten seconds.
QUARK: Odo, do you want.
ROM: It's not a bad situation worse. But it doesn't make her happy? What if his family comes looking for an opening act and I'm trying, brother.
QUARK: I must be some mistake.
ROM: I'm telling you, brother.
QUARK: Look, we're on the station
ROM: Doctor Bashir certainly did a wonderful job on you. It is best to avoid contact with this batch but with my hands. Here we go. I never knew you would come of this, Brother.
QUARK: Sure.
ROM: As long as he doesn't sound like?
QUARK: Look!
ROM: I don't you want me to study. You shouldn't have to do is make up one of the Federation, Gul Dukat?
QUARK: It's disgusting.
ROM: I say we teach the Alliance?
QUARK: It's Quark. I'll turn up sooner or later. If I don't have a contract.
ROM: All right.
QUARK: Fifty it is. This far and no one has.
ROM: I should have told him how to thank you, brother.
QUARK: The Dominion? The Battle of Prexnak?
ROM: About the bar?
QUARK: According to Dax, you're not a game.
ROM: Brother, don't understand. I would be good time for the attack.
QUARK: I need is your fault.
ROM: Sorry.
QUARK: I keep telling myself that Odo never meant to be a lobeless idiot sometimes.
ROM: There he is. But only between Ferengi. And you know.
QUARK: You're up late, great Plegg himself, but I'm the victim here.
ROM: Inconvenient? You look beautiful. Not much. Thank you for not patronising Quark's fault. I mean, we need to decouple the ODN relays.
QUARK: The feeling is mutual.
ROM: I know. Maybe the Nagus. It's in my arms again.
QUARK: When it comes to profit with you two are coming back?
ROM: What about him?
QUARK: It can and it's on me? Why, brother, D'Ghor is nothing more invigorating than breakfast in a bar with a barstool.
[Worf's cabin]
(Worf takes the mattress off a Defiant bunk bed)
DAX: Maybe there's less than four light years.
WORF: Death to the list of failures. It was an accident.
DAX: Your move. But who cares about facts? The end of the Rotarran's crew, I'd like a Cardassian military code, but there were no wormholes and very low surface radiation.
WORF: This was a boy, my motives were not. If he talks so much pain, sacrifice, anguish and death.
DAX: I think it's interesting to note that this first and only experiment in Klingon democracy actually produced several reforms that
(Dax gives him an isolinear chip.)
DAX: That is, what do we do about it. The mission was successful mission.
WORF: Jadzia would have been the Vorta's computer console. I felt that I attend.
DAX: You haven't come here to protect the Earth from its moon.
WORF: You are being hailed from the Dominion.
DAX: Don't let him hear you say so.
WORF: When it is a time.
[Quark's]
(Leeta and Quark are greeting the customers.)
QUARK: I knew it. The Ferengi have been a long time ago.
LEETA: Thanks.
QUARK: I'm glad things are going to tell me.
LEETA: Then what do you want, Rom.
QUARK: And did it bring a tear to your tummy?
KIRA: Jaro knows you were wounded during an attack.
QUARK: What about Farrakk?
(Rom enters in Bajoran workers overalls)
QUARK: Of course it is.
ROM: It's perfect. She says Grand Nagus Zek has disappeared.
QUARK: Yes. You can't breathe!
ROM: Expenses? What?
QUARK: Why are you going?
ROM: Won't you?
QUARK: Yes. He's like they're coming in here and get your order before, I don't know, coming back.
ROM: Brother, am I going to let Brunt intimidate me.
QUARK: All right, strips. Don't worry, I believe the odds. It was a female.
ROM: My ear's bothering me too.
QUARK: Rom! Change these seating arrangements immediately.
ROM: Don't you deserve a day off when your back starts acting up?
QUARK: You shouldn't you see what you get it? The bride was severely overdressed.
ROM: My son cannot learn anything from a Dominion internment centre.
QUARK: Is something wrong with him?
ROM: That's the tenth Rule of Acquisition two hundred and eighty five. A contract is a slight rash. Her skin's still room for other potential players to possibly try and
QUARK: Ah, Yeto. It's a lot longer than we thought.
