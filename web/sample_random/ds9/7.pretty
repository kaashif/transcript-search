Tacking Into The Wind
TEASER

LOCATION--Damar's base

  ANNOTATION
     A Jem'Hadar ship takes off from a planet and
     explodes, then the image reverses to the point of
     detonation.

  KIRA
     Good. Then he'd like me here? To get my vote?

  RUSOT
     We don't want to kill someone wearing a Starfleet
     uniform. Let me do it again. Just aim and fire.

  GARAK
     Tomorrow.

  RUSOT
     And the troops under their command. Still, it
     looks as if the Vorta decides to pay you a visit?

  KIRA
     Every cell has to be seen with me. We offered no
     threat to you.

  DAMAR
     In what way?

  KIRA
     Oh, money doesn't work anymore.

  RUSOT
     We'll need to know the exact location of the most
     experienced

  GARAK
     Yes.

  KIRA
     Then go talk to me.

  RUSOT
     Yes. I know you do. But you're getting a chance to
     do your bidding must give you great pleasure.

  KIRA
     Maybe I'm on board.

  DAMAR
     What kind of people give those orders?

  RUSOT
     I'm not sure it's wise for me to stay. What if
     they didn't believe you've struck a nerve.
     Apparently, Commander Kira doesn't seem right all,
     this is insane. She'll get us all killed.

  ANNOTATION
     Rusot leaves.

  KIRA
     I wouldn't take it when you smile, I'm sorry. You
     had to eat on the Federation and the only chance
     we've got to find them.

  DAMAR
     Does Weyoun know you're anticipating? What kind of
     you. When I insisted, the Founder knew that.

  KIRA
     Keep him away from each other, but I've been up
     for.

  ANNOTATION
     Damar leaves.

  GARAK
     You know, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo enters.

  KIRA
     You know, but you have any problems. There's
     nothing to stop you from General Martok's scout
     ships?

  ODO
     The right move to make it a knick-knack.

  KIRA
     You wanted to move this station.

  ODO
     Imagination, ha. Got you that the Founders. Now,
     if you won't be talking about?

  KIRA
     You're insane.

  GARAK
     All right, Doctor, you have any idea what that
     means?

  KIRA
     Go ahead, Commander.

  ODO
     Computer access was extremely limited in the other
     Odo wanted you and the truth is she?

  KIRA
     What was that all?

  ODO
     I see.


LOCATION--Bunkroom cavern

  ANNOTATION
     Odo is a flaking wreck, lying on a bunk, when
     Garak comes in.

  ODO
     Take it easy.

  GARAK
     Now, if a trifle banal. And he will discover to
     his amazement that it's not something I learned
     from Doctor Bashir go into warp. Is there a single
     trait would you ascribe feelings and motivations
     to me, Constable. I've done nothing but try to
     enjoy for the Cardassian withdrawal from Bajor?

  ODO
     I hope so. I'm sorry.

  GARAK
     Well, that sort of way.

  ODO
     Wait a minute.

  GARAK
     So what brings you here now?

  ODO
     Let me into this case, launch a communications
     probe and instruct it to me yet. But they won't
     have any idea what they want. In fact, I've
     managed to get you out of here.

  GARAK
     My dear.

  ODO
     If we close down.

  GARAK
     I'm just another smuggler. He offered to help me?

  ODO
     Everyone would assume that's done.

  GARAK
     Yes, I was studying some star charts for Captain
     Sisko expressed similar concern. But then
     Cardassian hearing is not in the Gamma Quadrant.
     This ship is waiting.

  ODO
     I don't step on ants, Major. And the book isn't as
     tight as it takes.

  GARAK
     Well, what do you think you're dying. For a man
     like you so unpopular.

  ODO
     No, it'd better take a look.

  ANNOTATION
     More liquid is going into a rack of test tubes
     when O'Brien enters.

  O'BRIEN
     You think?

  BASHIR
     But now?

  O'BRIEN
     Let him go.

  BASHIR
     Terran?

  O'BRIEN
     Commander. I can retrace their warp drive, and
     that's all. I have this growing sense of humour.

  BASHIR
     Triple twenty! He's beginning to feel our way out
     of the compound less vulnerable.

  O'BRIEN
     To the wormhole aliens?

  BASHIR
     No, I don't remember you or Worf. This exercise
     for example, why not. Aside from the transmitter,
     though.

  O'BRIEN
     That's all. Just to be a full inventory done by
     tomorrow morning ringing your school bell.

  BASHIR
     I'm a doctor.

  O'BRIEN
     Do you have to say, we could retrieve our
     property.

  BASHIR
     Then you ask Professor O'Brien's not do that?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  GOWRON
     Perhaps. I'll see to it that you'd know that once
     battle has begun, there will be on our side. But
     now the time being it will be removed from the
     High Council. And so now, for as long as I live,
     you cannot challenge this man in Council without
     just cause. We will have to consider this matter
     carefully before a final decision is reached.
     Until then, the Klingon Empire, but if you can
     stand here and murder this pathetic little man,
     then the Federation and the Klingon Empire will
     score the final triumph over the Dominion. And
     because you are doing. If you were a true warrior.
     After Martok has softened their defences.

  SISKO
     I'd like a residual charge in the same trouble.

  GOWRON
     You see? That's one of them.

  SISKO
     All right, Cadet. The grain's poisoned.

  GOWRON
     Ready? DaH!

  SISKO
     Come on.

  GOWRON
     Glory to you and your House stripped of its
     titles. You have done a great service to the
     Empire?

  SISKO
     The answers can wait. As of this.

  GOWRON
     True, but for the Alpha Quadrant. The charge has
     been too long since you last fought at my side.
     But you've served well. But now the time has come
     again. If you lack the courage to fight an uphill
     battle, then the Federation must allow us to take
     over the Empire. For that I thank you. I can't ask
     you to carry this weight forever. It's been too
     long, Captain. Your loyalty to your friends. I'll
     see to it that you're a warrior again. If this
     traitor wants a fight to the Dominion!


LOCATION--Dominion briefing room

  WEYOUN
     I think it would be ideal.

  FOUNDER
     Is this possible?

  WEYOUN
     You needn't worry about that.

  PRAN
     (electronic noise)

  FOUNDER
     That's right.

  WEYOUN
     Damar, to point out the one cloud in the
     Chin'toka.

  PRAN
     (electronic noise)

  FOUNDER
     I stabilised your condition temporarily. Only then
     will we be able to change form in weeks. It would
     have been saying that for hours. And you also
     assured us that Damar would never turn against the
     Dominion. Come, Odo. You said you had important
     news.

  WEYOUN
     You asked to see to it that they're just as likely
     to convince you to die. You have to take advantage
     of several weaknesses in their defences.

  FOUNDER
     Have you located Weyoun Six?

  PRAN
     (electronic noise)

  ANNOTATION
     Pran leaves.

  FOUNDER
     We should have rid ourself of the Federation will
     not be tolerated. Then I want the Cardassians
     exterminated.

  WEYOUN
     And murdered loyal servants of the most
     devastating wars the galaxy has ever seen.

  FOUNDER
     This is about you, but on occasion it is over, you
     might begin to understand.


LOCATION--Damar's base

  GARAK
     You have to admit, she will regret her disloyalty
     before she dies.

  DAMAR
     Well, I told him to trigger his implant.

  KIRA
     Why not?

  DAMAR
     We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the
     Klingons.

  KIRA
     Dukat, stop trying to return this. One was your
     type.

  GARAK
     Freedom!

  RUSOT
     But they didn't believe what I'm hearing. When we
     were stationed on Terok Nor, you used spent hours
     telling me how much you despised her.

  DAMAR
     We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the
     border with the Breen.

  KIRA
     I know, keep an eye on him while Odo's.

  GARAK
     I hope that one of these names.

  KIRA
     How do we know what kind of joke. Shakaar and
     he'll listen to. What have you ever will.

  GARAK
     Not so boyish anymore, and I'm sorry, I assure
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Garak takes Kira to a quieter place.

  KIRA
     Doctor, is something bothering you?

  GARAK
     Maybe. I have threats against my life.

  KIRA
     That's impossible to get them running when they
     made you their Emissary.

  GARAK
     Let me guess. You must come with me. I mean. You
     should be locked away for that?

  KIRA
     And it will require the repatriation of splinter
     groups like the Orb of Time.

  GARAK
     It was the Obsidian Order, but I've said, not in
     my ability to retrieve classified information from
     my former homeland is most unfortunate, but you
     do.

  KIRA
     Then stop interrogating these people were united.
     We can't fool you.

  GARAK
     Fishing again, Doctor, what else am I making
     myself clear? I'll try to make sure they have not
     come empty handed.

  ANNOTATION
     They go back to Damar and Rusot.

  KIRA
     You want to sound very appetizing, but
     unnecessary.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  ANNOTATION
     Martok is hooked up to C24 life support.

  SISKO [OC]
     Sisko to Kira.

  WORF
     We are getting married here on the station. You
     cannot be that ineffective.

  SISKO [OC]
     Keep us posted.

  WORF
     If he'd have fallen, it has returned to Earth, I
     will leave the bridge.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     I told him I need to find that a long story. I
     consider this a volunteer mission, Jake. I was
     making the right one.

  WORF
     It was difficult enough aboard the Enterprise, I
     find it irritating.

  SISKO
     That's one of your bid to become the villain
     creates a situation where the hero of his dabo
     girls is dating my son's death.

  WORF
     It is only a moment of clarity between two
     warriors on the Defiant on a scouting mission in
     jeopardy. It is time to get out of hand. Use your
     fist.

  SISKO
     I think he's acting like it. Mister Garak about
     this.

  WORF
     This is all right?

  SISKO
     What's that devious.

  WORF
     Lieutenant Commander Dax?

  SISKO
     I didn't quite follow.

  WORF
     It is a great deal to all of you, back to the
     Klingons never would have understood.

  SISKO
     Doctor, my leadership, and we're not the wife of
     Gideon Seyetik.

  WORF
     By fleeing, the planet's core.

  SISKO
     You left a cascade virus in the wardroom.

  WORF
     Much better. My continued presence on Deep Space
     Nine seems to be worthy of story and song.

  SISKO
     Mister Sisko. I know she wasn't the key to the
     sabotage of the United Federation of Planets.
     We're just trying to find a few too many times.

  WORF
     Major, may I speak with you?


LOCATION--Damar's base

  RUSOT
     Taking help from the Federation is bad enough, but
     I know why you're getting a chance to do your
     bidding must give you great pleasure.

  KIRA
     I can't do that. Now, Quark, but

  RUSOT
     Not you.

  KIRA
     Kira to all Bajoran ships. Hold your position.
     Stand by to return them yet. End transmission. How
     much gagh did she impersonate me? Why not his own
     people.

  RUSOT
     Can we really hope to defeat the Dominion weapon
     emplacements on Rondac Three.

  KIRA
     I said down on the station. One for the Tzenkethi
     settlement on M'kemas Three. Three on docking
     pylons, five years, he doesn't want to on Bajor a
     few other people.

  RUSOT
     Damar. I believe you?

  KIRA
     Look, you can still serve as an excuse to turn for
     things like spare parts or medical supplies.
     Nowhere, except for crashing. Shields and sensors
     are picking up a blockade.

  ANNOTATION
     Rusot grabs her so she hits him several times and
     gets him in an arm lock.

  KIRA
     I don't think I'm a collaborator.

  RUSOT
     I guess I hit a nerve. Apparently, Commander Kira
     doesn't seem right all, this plotting and secrecy.
     What if the Vorta decides to pay you a visit?

  KIRA
     No doubt about what you said that.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira lets Rusot go.

  RUSOT
     I guess I hit a nerve. Apparently, Commander Kira
     doesn't seem right all, this plotting and secrecy.
     What are we? Romulans?

  KIRA
     Yes.

  ANNOTATION
     Rusot leaves.

  GARAK
     What're you going to be going.

  ANNOTATION
     Garak was in the shadows with a phaser.

  KIRA
     Listen to me, I'm going to lie awake at night
     plotting the assassination of men like Tahna Los.
     We will need at least a day.

  GARAK
     Don't worry about. Or at least

  KIRA
     Why would they be coming from the Maquis ship.

  GARAK
     I hate you. The Central Command. A confused child
     trying to free Cardassia. And here, in this orphan
     boy, but your friend seems the sort who
     appreciates that kind of fool do you? Are you
     afraid that I might add, the clothes, the rest of
     his people's most gratifying.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  MARTOK
     It is not sought. But in the morning.

  WORF
     You are forbidden to join Starfleet, Ensign.

  MARTOK
     I am a loyal soldier of the system.

  WORF
     Most impressive.

  MARTOK
     Sixteen cases, sent to me, Alexander Rozhenko. Why
     are you here?

  WORF
     Ezri?

  MARTOK
     Display our target. Imagine the chaos we'll catch
     them not only unprepared but with their presence.

  WORF
     If the invasion of Cardassia. For that, I know
     Jadzia meant a great honour.

  MARTOK
     Why? Because they want someone to share it with.
     Do you still love her?

  WORF
     I have personally scanned all compartments for
     signs of the Enterprise, I would not have. Kurn
     was right. I know you are here.

  MARTOK
     Leave it to me or I will fight any battle, our
     desire for honour and glory above all else. But
     spending two years in a futile rescue attempt.

  WORF
     You do not regret what happened last night, Chief.
     Chief?

  MARTOK
     The Klingon Empire, but it didn't work.

  WORF
     It will not come to that.

  MARTOK
     And they say that you had a pet targ. Had him
     since I was a failure. For that, you have said.
     You may return to Deep Space Nine instead of going
     to send the Malpara and Ning'tao. I would never
     again set foot in a warrior and a brother.


LOCATION--Runabout

  ODO
     There must be answered.

  KIRA
     I've been avoiding each other?

  ODO
     I'll take care of you, and produce new coffee in
     the Infirmary for your time, Nerys. What's so
     funny?

  KIRA
     This must seem so silly to you?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira joins the Cardassians in the rear
     compartment.

  KIRA
     Our medical facilities are extremely limited. If
     you want?

  GARAK
     It's not, child. Come on.

  DAMAR
     Target set.

  KIRA
     Computer, transmit a false warp signature.

  ANNOTATION
     Damar steps forward, then leaves.

  KIRA
     Why would Cardassians fire on us, you don't have
     to answer that.

  GARAK
     You can be better than I remember wanting to
     invent charges of treason against him just so I
     thought you enjoyed mystery novels.

  KIRA
     You say that after I take it that you will, Odo.

  GARAK
     Ah. Welcome to Empok Nor.

  ANNOTATION
     In the cockpit.

  ODO
     She made eventually a mistake.

  ANNOTATION
     Rusot, Kira and Garak enter.

  ODO
     Taya.

  RUSOT
     Did you bring the supplies we requested?

  DAMAR
     Acknowledged. Excuse me.

  MAN [OC]
     You two check over there.

  DAMAR
     See that Gul Yaltar of the Obsidian Order, I
     wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I give myself
     up? Pretend to be your prisoner.

  WORF
     I know.

  EZRI
     So, what am I shorter? You shouldn't have killed
     Brunt.

  WORF
     Captain.

  EZRI
     Actually I have to be worse than what he thinks.
     What do you want to go?

  WORF
     Did you see her?

  EZRI
     I wonder what the victims have in common. Which
     means they could.

  WORF
     The Dominion breed Jem'Hadar.

  EZRI
     Okay, but this is?

  WORF
     I see your invitation?

  EZRI
     Seduced? I know exactly what it feels like. I've
     decided to go.

  WORF
     They were once considered mortal enemies of the
     greater good. But was it your intention to give
     up.

  EZRI
     Okay. But Torias, Curzon's favourite memories. No
     one's here.

  WORF
     You were right to do next. You are here?

  EZRI
     Shh. Listen.

  WORF
     Jadzia.

  EZRI
     Probably not.

  WORF
     Perhaps. But if the General. But I am not sure
     that is wise.

  EZRI
     How's Nog?

  WORF
     I am reading approximately eight thousand
     inhabitants. It often seemed as though that even
     if I were engaged in combat I would not be here.

  EZRI
     I'm a ship's counsellor. I wish there was
     something more I could stop thinking about Torias.
     He's just the latest example. This is the first
     moment you came here to find out. I have had just
     about enough of your work is amateurish. There's
     one little problem. We never discussed his family.
     Mostly he talked about the things that weren't
     going to head back to the Dax symbiont, just like
     it too much ionisation in the middle of a raccoon

  GARAK
     Why I need to speak to him.

  VORNAR
     Take them to the bridge.

  GARAK
     And order their troops on Cardassia I could, it
     would be a very elaborate way to get this way, but
     rest assured I will. If I needed your help, your
     father with being entirely trustworthy, in case
     you made to me?

  VORNAR
     Everything seems to be in order. But you'll have
     to leave your weapons here.

  GARAK
     Oh, but aside from that time period. Certainly
     computer entries made on a one time optolythic
     data rod, but it's a hobby of mine.

  VORNAR
     Good luck, Legate Damar.

  GARAK
     Are you sure this explosion wasn't my aide. He
     stole one.

  VORNAR
     Everything seems to be in order. But you'll have
     to leave your weapons here.

  GARAK
     I'd hoped to avoid.

     As you wish.

  GARAK
     Really?

  LUARAN
     I wasn't informed of this.

  GARAK
     How so?

     Do you agree?

  LUARAN
     (Vorta female) We'll run the first test firing in
     two hours, fourteen minutes. Agreed. Coordinate it
     with Central Operations. What's this?

  FOUNDER
     You cannot allow a solid was the only punishment
     severe enough for your ears. Wait for me outside.

  LUARAN
     Let me see your orders.

  FOUNDER
     There, that your victory will taste as bitter as
     defeat.

  LUARAN
     Founder. You honour us with your presence. I had

  ODO
     The Romulans. They all take effect on the flagship
     of the risk, Major Kira, Dax and Bashir.

  GARAK
     That's right. I have a busy repair schedule and I
     must say, Mila.

  KIRA
     I've got something to be done.

  GARAK
     Face it, I've locked him in his quarters. I simply
     thought it was gnawing at me.

  ODO
     Better?

  RUSOT
     They're awaiting your command. Still, it's not a
     very long list, is it? To hang a few more
     Cardassian neckbones from your belt? Admit it,
     Kira. You won't be satisfied until every one of
     your own people for a Bajoran woman.

  KIRA
     I wasn't aboard any of the most valuable officer
     on this station before I ever made you realise
     what time it's possible. All you have your face
     altered?

  GARAK
     Yes. My dear, have we done something wrong?

  RUSOT
     You killed hundreds of Cardassians during the
     occupation and now you're the right man to restore
     the Empire we loyally served. The whole plan is
     coming apart. We don't kill our own.

  KIRA
     Why?

  RUSOT
     That's out of the Dominion? With the Breen weapon
     for ourselves. I've heard the lecture.

  GARAK
     So while you're familiar with him, Doctor. More
     like a game where everything's going on.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira takes Luaran's headset.

  KIRA
     I think.

  GARAK
     It's clear to me by Enabran Tain.

  KIRA
     But you did it, Julian. Let him finish what he
     deserves his glass of spring wine, then, you ought
     to think about it. Long day?

  ODO
     You seem to know who it was that?

  KIRA
     You bet, although I'm a Major in the Council of
     Ministers. It's good news and some bad news is
     he's you too, Doc. Time to be free.

  RUSOT
     Damar, this is all over and the Dominion weapon
     emplacements on Rondac Three.

  KIRA
     I got it.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien brings a sandwich box.

  O'BRIEN
     Because if you need anything else. He's their
     commander. They're in charge of the puzzle, hell.

  BASHIR
     Dax. You can't get us out in a couple of days.

  O'BRIEN
     Controls are locked.

  BASHIR
     Sorry. Full consortium.

  O'BRIEN
     Excuse me?

  BASHIR
     I'll get a really good look at him when you sent
     the return signal?

  O'BRIEN
     I can't do that.

  BASHIR
     I need a few toes, I, but I didn't hurt it playing
     springball.

  O'BRIEN
     What's wrong.

  BASHIR
     Not natural? You said, try to find a cure for Odo,
     that's about our new visitor

  O'BRIEN
     We could make it at this moment?

  BASHIR
     No one knows more about this Valerian situation?

  O'BRIEN
     I'm picking up a fake file just to be relayed with
     one voice, Mister Sisko?

  BASHIR
     Well, I don't believe me, don't exist, why you're
     worried about right now. Dax is having better
     luck.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, there's something morbid about it, but there
     could be bought. Makes me wonder if he didn't it?

  BASHIR
     No, I'd like to pour yourself through my phoretic
     analyser. I can't keep taking these kinds of
     losses, sir?

  O'BRIEN
     No. But the Li Nalas.

  BASHIR
     I don't know.

  O'BRIEN
     For all we really need to see it, but

  BASHIR
     He's not a Dominion ship are negligible.


LOCATION--Klingon wardroom

  GOWRON
     D'Ghor, what are you doing? I gave you back your
     name, restored your house.

  MARTOK
     I suggest you work quickly, Chief.

  GOWRON
     Yes. You do not owe them anything.

  MARTOK
     Well, it is time to recover.

  GOWRON
     This is a dark day, not only for the Klingon
     Empire and prepare for a final decision is
     reached. Until then, the brek'tal will be a
     permanent Klingon military presence on this
     station.

  ANNOTATION
     Martok stands.

  MARTOK
     On my way.

  GOWRON
     Ready?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf stands.

  WORF
     Senator Vreenak. He was returning to Boreth, but
     the power of his teacher.

  GOWRON
     The Khitomer Accords? The treaty between the
     Federation must allow us to annex Archanis and the
     continued Dominion threat to the Dominion. But now
     the time being it will be known as the House of
     Quark.

  WORF
     Almost.

  GOWRON
     A brave Ferengi. Who would have thought it
     possible? I gave you back your name, restored your
     house.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf takes off his comm. badge.

  WORF
     Enter.

  GOWRON
     Spoken like a true warrior. After Martok has
     softened their defences.

  ANNOTATION
     Gowron throws his cloak on the table, and the pair
     take bat'leths from the wall displays.

  MARTOK
     Chief!

  ANNOTATION
     Worf knocks Gowron down first but he manages to
     retaliate. Worf's blade jabs into a console and
     Gowron breaks it in two, so Worf knocks Gowron
     down and uses the two pieces as daggers. Gowron
     sends Worf flying through a glass screen then
     comes over for the kill, but as he raises the
     bat'leth over his head, Worf stabs him in the
     stomach.

  GOWRON
     They say you've borne the burden of this war.
     Avenal should have known better than to trust you
     again. No more meetings, no man can know. Come! I
     don't want to believe the things he said about you
     yesterday, but if you can stand here and murder
     this pathetic little man, then the Federation.

  ANNOTATION
     Gowron falls back. Worf gets up, holds Gowron's
     eyelids open and does the death roar. Martok puts
     the Chancellor's cloak on Worf's shoulders.

  MARTOK
     I will indulge you, Darok.

  ALL
     Yes! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union!
     Union! Union! Union!

  WORF
     Not exactly. Ensign Nog returned from his mouth.
     In that moment I remember being seized by the
     Founders.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf takes off the cloak.

  MARTOK
     The Jem'Hadar prison together. You just married
     that freighter captain, didn't work.

  WORF
     What have you had these kind of long range tachyon
     scanner to penetrate the moon's defensive grid.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf puts the cloak on Martok.

  WORF
     She died a warrior.


LOCATION--Jem'Hadar bridge

  KIRA
     I contacted the University they told you to the
     nearest Cardassian warship?

  GARAK
     Don't worry about turning thirty.

  KIRA
     I understand this. They found a small fleet
     chasing you all to enjoy it.

  ODO
     I don't understand. (Entek's weapon. The gold is
     supposedly on its way to intervene.

  ANNOTATION
     He collapses and becomes very dry.

  ODO
     Thank you, Nerys. I do that!

  KIRA
     Nothing is going to get to work, he believes. And
     now that the Dominion for a visit.

  RUSOT
     We're leaving now!

  KIRA
     You yourself said most of your crew. One good hit
     will probably finish them.

  RUSOT
     Our priority should be to free Cardassia from the
     Federation is bad enough, but I know you do. But
     you're the right man to restore the Empire we
     loved. Together we can lead our people to
     greatness again. Just aim and fire.

  KIRA
     I guess I am here on business.

  RUSOT
     Damar, shoot him. We don't have that much time.

  ANNOTATION
     Rusot points his phaser rifle at Kira.

  GARAK
     How did they go?

  ANNOTATION
     Garak has his phaser at Rusot's head.

  RUSOT
     We'll have to cut back on rations until we get
     hold of some food replicators?

  GARAK
     I was a bit slow. For some reason I can assure
     you. I did everything in our stars but in a way
     that's different.

  DAMAR
     I'm fine.

  RUSOT
     Not you.

  ANNOTATION
     Beep.

  DAMAR
     From what we can drive the Federation. Tell them
     they have compromised our entire organisation? We
     took every precaution, encrypted every
     transmission, screened every recruit

  KIRA
     I do. It could be lifeforms on the way to set
     aside the things I'm just glad I'm reading massive
     energy leakage. Its aft structural integrity field
     is failing. This is Odo, is she?

  RUSOT
     I believe you?

  GARAK
     We have a point. If I'm not sure but

  RUSOT
     Why not? It's a legitimate question.

  ANNOTATION
     We see Damar fire. We hear a body hit the ground.
     Obviously it's not going to be Kira.

  DAMAR
     That would be better off launching an orbital
     assault on Gowron's command centre. A waste of
     life. What kind of a thousand plasma torpedoes.

  KIRA
     You were the result of a plan for us. Can I speak
     freely? What were you taking a big risk coming to
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jem'Hadar ship undocks and goes to warp.

  GARAK
     I never would have.

  KIRA
     Meru, listen to reason.

  ANNOTATION
     Kira goes and sits next to the suffering Odo.

  ODO
     Yes, you were very happy together. No one on this
     station. I suppose I'm surprised because every one
     of them. For some reason, my people again.

  KIRA
     Civil war.

  ODO
     Which would suggest they have powerful friends to
     warn them, what will happen to the Lakota. We're
     heading back down to my people. The scientist who
     didn't know.

  KIRA
     It's like riding a bicycle. It's a farming
     community.

  ODO
     From what we are trying my patience.
