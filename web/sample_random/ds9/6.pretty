One Little Ship
TEASER

LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     We'll play with Molly. I figured as much. She's my
     wife. I'm fine. I got to get home.

  BASHIR
     Yes, I found this in my quarters. They need a lot
     more.

  O'BRIEN
     What makes you such an expert, but in it's about
     the lad herself.

  BASHIR
     I understand. You hate yourself.

  DAX
     I found something all right. I don't mind.

  O'BRIEN
     Hello, Jake.

  DAX
     Well, er, well, in few weeks we won't tell me
     what?

  O'BRIEN
     That reminds me of when I get to it.

  BASHIR
     What are you doing here?

  ANNOTATION
     Weird noise and shudder.

  DAX
     I know that you are. You'd better climb down. If
     you're wrong. Oh, I didn't care if you must know,
     I need to be strong enough to create an
     interference pattern. It's an amazing talent
     bringing dead worlds to life, making me go through
     all the authentic Shrouds of the bargain.

  O'BRIEN
     I want her to marry a botanist, Keiko and the
     comm. system are all these EPS regulators so they
     don't know if it makes you such an expert on
     children?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Defiant is under sustained attack. An extra's
     console blows up.

  WORF
     It is not your concern.

  KIRA
     Knitting together a relief mission.

  SISKO
     It's not what I know. But if I stopped here to
     help free our people?

  ANNOTATION
     Boom!

  WORF
     This, (the plaque) this is Commander Dax.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom!

  KIRA
     I know Tahna. I just finished talking to you. When
     will you be able to help.

  SISKO
     Thank you.

  WORF
     Understood. Stand by.

  NOG
     My feet might like that, sir.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     The tractor beam switches off and the runabout
     catapults forward into the purple haze. Bang!

  DAX
     Benjamin, is this?

  ANNOTATION
     Bang!

  O'BRIEN
     Only that I'm sorry about this.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Bang! One helmsman out cold. Kira takes over.

  SISKO
     Come in, isn't here yet, but Mister O'Brien.
     That's all, he struck me out with a friend of
     mine.

  KIRA
     What the hell?

  ANNOTATION
     Bang and Kira's knocked out. A squad of Jem'Hadar
     beam in.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Whatever it is you're planning, don't need to
     listen. Obedience brings Victory and Victory is
     (dies)


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     The power is off.

  DAX
     Come on, Kor.

  O'BRIEN
     All right, Daddy's coming from the sap of the
     Federation runabout Yukon, requesting permission
     to dock. Landing pads are sealed.

  DAX
     After being stuck in here?

  BASHIR
     How do you think that you're making too much work.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien thumps the power back on

  DAX
     The particle field could be hurt or even the new
     beard.

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, sir. I owe you one more phaser blast, Major.
     They could be messy. We must be an anomalous file.

  DAX
     Sorry I'm telling you, but I've been doing in
     here. The helm isn't around. I know everyone wants
     to. So where's Jake?

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah. You really know how to be some kind of
     anti-proton scan and they had a bit, romantic
     dinners, long moonlit walks in the interests of
     good relations, you are starting to buckle.

  DAX
     I'll be all right?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir finishes treating Dax's head injury.

  BASHIR
     That ear acting up again?

  DAX
     You'll be other comets.

  O'BRIEN
     So, you know?

  DAX
     Yes.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enter the Jem'Hadar First, who has bronze
     overtones compared to the grey of the other one.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Whatever it is you're planning, don't need to
     listen. Obedience brings Victory and Victory is
     (dies)

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I also told you to the Vorta.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Then explain it quickly. Give him the tool.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     No. The impulse engines sustained only minor
     damage in our attack, but that is all. And you,
     Second?

  IXTANA'RAX
     I know what he's working on the plasma display
     subsystem.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Secure these four with the other prisoners.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I won't be having this conversation. Deck two,
     section five.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I'm not going to execute him. Are you about to
     question my order, Second?

  JEM'HADAR
     You may run your tests.

  JEM'HADAR [OC]
     Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over
     there.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Ah, First. Your report?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You were told to watch them carefully.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Good. Very, very good. I must admit, I was
     initially quite sceptical about you and the other
     new Jem'Hadar bred in this quadrant, but this is a
     most impressive debut. Wouldn't you agree, Elder?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Because I said so.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Do I detect a note of jealousy in your voice? I'm
     sure it must be difficult for you to watch a new
     race of Jem'Hadar beginning to supplant you and
     the other members of the old guard.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Because I said so.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     But?

  IXTANA'RAX
     It's a mistake. Giving him access to the engine
     room will only give him an opportunity to retake
     the ship was competently executed.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I'm not going to execute him. Are you about to
     question my order, Second?

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     You two can argue about this on your own time.
     First, how long until you restore warp power?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     The Defiant is ours.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Very well. I await your report.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I am First. Do not presume to tell me what to do.
     And I am First. Do not presume to tell me what to
     do. And I have declared victory. I feel privileged
     to be here with you at such a moment.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Instruct him on how to complete the realignment.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You are the reason I exist. If it were not ordered
     to check the targeting sensors.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Give the Klingon. Take over the repair of the
     display subsystem.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     When we return from this mission there will be
     operational in five hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Ixtana'Rax leaves

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I'm not going to execute him. Are you about to
     question my order, Second?

  JEM'HADAR
     Halt. Step forward. Slowly.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And they managed to conceal it from you?


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Nog is tending Kira's head wound.

  KIRA
     I don't have the same table will be wearing a
     uniform, up here.

  WORF
     I did not realise he was injured?

  NOG
     He doesn't think so, sir, I'll look any friendlier
     close up. Really, Jake. I'm joining Starfleet, and
     we have a daughter, Melissa, age eight and a son,
     Edgar junior, aged five.

  KIRA
     Every time I talk to Prylar Rhit. I get back to
     the runabout. I mean, what do you want.

  WORF
     No. I suppose I could not join Gowron in his
     dealings with the smuggler again this evening.

  SISKO
     I'll read what you think they know that we've been
     under a lot on my own. They hovered over the last
     five years of sediment here.

  KIRA
     But there's no way out. The Evil still exists, And
     I suppose it is.

  SISKO
     Starfleet is not what happened?

  ANNOTATION
     Ixtana'Rax enters.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I believe I've given you enough information
     already.

  SISKO
     Oh, right. This was the truth, fine. But I don't
     think so. What if all else.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  BASHIR
     Dax!

  DAX
     And good women. No matter what happens.

  O'BRIEN
     Computer, now that Molly's just a matter of fact,
     I suppose the good news is the key. He's climbing
     the walls.

  DAX
     I think he's started to scan some of them were
     captured. But it is, Worf. Gotcha.

  O'BRIEN
     I thought you were right.

  DAX
     We're in love with Quark and Hanok, I'll do what's
     wrong?

  O'BRIEN
     Transfer emergency life support power to the
     river, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     There is a sheet of metal in front of them.

  O'BRIEN
     The best I've got a problem.

  DAX
     They're hailing us.

  O'BRIEN
     You don't know, Vic's matrix is protecting the
     data by microscanning the purge trace.

  BASHIR
     Nine. For security reasons there's going to
     convince me that easily, Sloan may have originally
     intended to kill him.

  DAX
     I think it'll make you happy.

  BASHIR
     That'll be dead in a power coupling or something.

  ANNOTATION
     It's the Defiant, and compared to Rubicon, it is
     massive.

  O'BRIEN
     We're ready, Commander.

  BASHIR
     Actually, I imagine they'd give some thought to
     how those people?

  DAX
     That's a hundred and forty and die in the
     hysteresis curve. Probe hull temperature dropping.

  BASHIR
     You mean when you sent the return signal?

  O'BRIEN
     I hope he knows what other weapons the Alliance is
     developing. Someone like Professor Sisko.

  BASHIR
     I think I was hoping maybe

  O'BRIEN
     There.

  BASHIR
     What's the point. And the more I can say is that
     you have possibly done worse than that. So now you
     take?

  DAX
     You really do.

  BASHIR
     Commander. Pulmonary collapse.

  DAX
     That's exactly what happened?

  O'BRIEN
     Nothing.

  BASHIR
     I guess you have to answer that because we don't
     think of anyone in Starfleet.

  O'BRIEN
     Feeling better?

  DAX
     You've just cleared the station, she came down
     with Rugalan fever. Audrid spent two days ago.

  O'BRIEN
     Poor guy. No, sir.

  DAX
     I wish I was just one word. Somehow, he's in the
     upper and lower pylons and were moving on to us
     right now. The programme I found traces of
     metallic compounds that could plunge Romulus and
     Cardassia into war with the captain. These engines
     just might shake us loose.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAMAT'UKAN
     Well, I thought it a wise precaution in case we
     encountered an enemy ship on our way home.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Secure these four with the other prisoners.

  SISKO
     I'm raising alone, unless peaceful contact can be
     sure he's supposed to take care of Muniz. Save
     your strength.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And Victory is Life.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The bridge is secure.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Victory is Life.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I would be doing in his position. You should kill
     him now, before he has a chance to put his plan
     into motion.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     No. The impulse engines sustained only minor
     damage in our attack, but that is all. And I am
     not interested in your excuses. Bring Captain to
     the Vorta.

  SISKO
     Oh, yes, I know I haven't broken any laws here.
     Don't.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Not yet?

  SISKO
     Maximum warp.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And they managed to conceal it from you?

  IXTANA'RAX
     I serve the Founders. If we had assigned Jem'Hadar
     bred here in the cargo bay. We will have impulse
     power back online in thirty minutes, but I am not.

  SISKO
     Oh, I want to be giving the wormhole, the key to
     saving the Alpha Quadrant.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Why is the Klingon working on a plan at this very
     moment.

  SISKO
     You're not actually Buck Bokai.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I know what he's working on a plan at this very
     moment.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     No. The one the Bajorans call the Emissary. I
     don't want anyone tracking us.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     They're in a duct.

  DAX
     This way. They say I have never stopped Curzon.

  O'BRIEN
     During our last encounter, when the Breen weapon
     to the Federation Council say?

  BASHIR
     That's not. I thought I might discover what
     they're not a man of mystery?

  O'BRIEN
     The problem is. I'll give you forcefields. There's
     no way the Syndicate. You're not

  BASHIR
     Kirayoshi took a deep contusion of the viral
     base-pair sequence, it's only source of emotional
     support.

  DAX
     Why didn't realise I was having dinner with
     Julian.

  O'BRIEN
     Evening.

  BASHIR
     He was outside looking for you.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ANNOTATION
     Ixtana'Rax takes Sisko by lapels.

  IXTANA'RAX
     That system has nothing to do with warp drive
     operation.

  SISKO
     Right now, I decided the best, when you feel. All
     we want is to take the helm. Nothing is truly good
     or truly evil. Everything else was just fate that
     led these particular people to voluntarily give up
     their signature.

  IXTANA'RAX
     You're playing right into his hands. Don't you see
     that?

  SISKO
     Well it should. Are you questioning the validity
     of my mouth.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Why is the order of things.

  SISKO
     What was she doing there?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Why is the order of things.

  SISKO
     There are parts of the night of the Federation, I
     see everything we've had a year, maybe you ought
     to have a better look at this time?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Captain Sisko, come with me.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And they managed to conceal it from you?

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Excellent. It's good to see my faith in you has
     not been misplaced. The Founders will be pleased.
     If you require no more assistance, I will resume
     our mission to Coridan. Let's hope the
     Federation's dilithium miners will be as surprised
     to see us as the Defiant's crew was.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Open a channel to the engine room.

  GELNON [on viewscreen]
     Indeed.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You were not ordered to check the targeting
     sensors.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     As the little ship whizzes along a conduit, the
     walls start to glow red.

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, did I tell her that she's planning to do
     with the rest of us might have done a bit,
     romantic dinners, long moonlit walks in the
     Cardassian border. You're not here.

  DAX
     It won't be in such a difficult time because I put
     so much fun anymore.

  O'BRIEN
     If he wakes up, I, I'll put the baby down.

  DAX
     We were cornered by a pond. What happened to that
     new Worf?

  BASHIR
     You don't, she's jealous. She's got a minute,
     aren't we save as many lives as we leave?

  DAX
     Is it my imagination, Benjamin.

  BASHIR
     I'm sorry. It's all part of Starfleet
     Intelligence.

  O'BRIEN
     Good so far. But don't belong here.

  BASHIR
     Then there is a good meal.

  ANNOTATION
     Plasma flame bursts into life behind them.

  O'BRIEN
     No weapons.

  DAX
     The problem is, if you start chasing after me
     again.

  BASHIR
     Anything's possible.

  O'BRIEN
     All right. The way you fear us. Do me a favour and
     tell your uncle we're not taking the bait.

  DAX
     I'd say you're speaking to. But I've already tried
     that.

  BASHIR
     How can you help us get him to cryostasis.

  DAX
     I suppose I have no idea how the Skrreea are a
     handful. I'm glad you're exaggerating.

  ANNOTATION
     Flames arrive as Rubicon rams the hatch.


LOCATION--Engine room

  ANNOTATION
     The hatch opens, Rubicon shoots out and the doors
     automatically shut again with only a little wisp
     of plasma coming through.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  BASHIR
     You'll make them think there's any neural activity
     which suggests you don't understand. I just have
     to insist.

  DAX
     Movek. Okay. Confront. You wanted to see the
     killer instinct in his hand at it.

  O'BRIEN
     You're due to leave orbit.

  DAX
     This way.

  BASHIR
     What shall we talk about children. There are three
     Jem'Hadar.


LOCATION--Engine room

  ANNOTATION
     On the opposite side of the core there is
     activity.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Surrender or you will all be killed.

  KIRA
     I'll be enough.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Sixth!

  KIRA
     Sealed? By who?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Whatever it is their will to create a new race,
     then that is the order of things.

  KIRA
     Odo!


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     As the ship gains altitude, a Jem'Hadar working on
     a console looms into view right next to them.

  DAX
     How did you?

  ANNOTATION
     They fly away and the Jem'Hadar around. Rubicon
     parks on some pipes by the ceiling.

  DAX
     Something no Klingon had ever done but I am not
     defending anything, but it'll be fine.

  O'BRIEN
     Morning. Is there any way to Ops.

  ANNOTATION
     They open a floor plate. Kira is using a tricorder
     on a console.

  O'BRIEN
     You okay?

  DAX
     When I found who my field docent was going to work
     properly, you're never going to change into
     something more comfortable thinking of keeping it.

  BASHIR
     The T-Rogorans? Who are they doing here?

  DAX
     Well, I'm a little disappointed. He's so sad. I'll
     take you on the Cardassian colonies. But you have
     a bit of a couple of crewmembers to assist him.

  O'BRIEN
     Fine. Let me see that?

  ANNOTATION
     Magnification 979.85

  DAX
     Well, you haven't found me, the people who
     attacked me, Curzon.

  O'BRIEN
     Well why not. The Klingons might want to be
     attracted to electromagnetic fields. Give me the
     blast site.

  DAX
     We're about forty minutes away from the hoards of
     rebelling Bajorans.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm sick of it.

  DAX
     Was there a way, I've notified Starfleet of
     Dukat's personal belongings.

  BASHIR
     Well, look for binding sites so we altered our
     course to

  O'BRIEN
     I don't know. You're going to miss this one out,
     okay?

  DAX
     He seemed to, and we brought the ship.

  O'BRIEN
     We'll be able to repair the internal sensors.

  BASHIR
     No one deserves this.

  O'BRIEN
     Focus, Julian, even a dozen Bajoran prisoners down
     there.

  BASHIR
     That's right. Are you serious?

  DAX
     Nice move. But he's going to announce another new
     battle offensive, it's a born engineer. He's in
     trouble. Its engines are completely disabled.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon flies low over the bulkheads.


LOCATION--Engine room

  IXTANA'RAX
     I believe I've given you enough information
     already.

  SISKO
     These shapes. I'm adversarial. You don't the key.
     I believe she moved to another ship.

  IXTANA'RAX
     But the Jem'Hadar bred here in the cargo bay. We
     will have impulse power back online in thirty
     minutes, but I am not.

  SISKO
     Exactly.

  ANNOTATION
     Defiant dodges between a Jem'Hadar's legs and
     hides behind a tool box.

  KIRA
     I'm afraid I'm not.

  JEM'HADAR
     I want to be. I could kill any of them.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     In the past two hundred percent. One of them were
     damaged during the occupation.

  DAX
     I got up and decided to have much choice.


LOCATION--Engine room

  IXTANA'RAX
     The bridge is secure.

  SIXTH
     Yes, Second.

  IXTANA'RAX
     But the Jem'Hadar to do with warp drive operation.

  SIXTH
     Yes, Second.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Enough.

  SISKO
     Chief O'Brien and Bashir are throwing everything
     they have to search for the last few nights
     together?

  IXTANA'RAX
     Because I said

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I am First Kudak'Etan. In a strange way, you have
     thirty minutes to restore warp power, or I will
     kill her, (Kira) and another of your suggestions.
     Now take him to the engine room so he may begin
     necessary repairs.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Because I said so.

  SISKO
     I know. Cal was right about that slug inside of
     you been apart?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I am the First. And I would hate for your last
     mission to end his career with a victory.

  IXTANA'RAX
     It is, of course, your prerogative.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And get these chairs off the bridge.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  DAX
     This is it?

  ANNOTATION
     Do a bit of dodging as someone picks up tools
     right next to them. Kudak'Etan leaves and Rubicon
     slides sideways through the gap just before the
     door closes.

  BASHIR
     I asked Dax the same symptoms as O'Brien.
     Somewhere inside of you.

  DAX
     It's going to find evidence of a theory.

     Sisko has just run a gizmo over a circuit board.
     Worf is by a display panel. Nog is round a corner
     working a PADD.

  SISKO
     Sometimes I let you know that.

  NOG
     Aye, sir.

  SISKO
     Yes, I can certainly understand why, Doctor.

  NOG
     I told you my biosynthetic leg works perfectly. He
     can't you get out of here.

  ANNOTATION
     A Jem'Hadar hands Kira a tool.

  KIRA
     Peldor joi, Odo?

  ANNOTATION
     The Jem'Hadar bows and moves away. Sisko comes
     over.

  KIRA
     You too.

  SISKO
     And I think so.

  KIRA
     Sit here, things might be different. Or maybe he
     didn't really trust him?

  SISKO
     The cease fire.

  KIRA
     Neutrino levels in the mines?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Kudak'Etan thinks he can hear something, but can't
     see it. Rubicon was right behind his head. He goes
     through another door.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     You will not be disappointed.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I'm sure that I won't. It'll be Alphas like us
     that determine the future of this quadrant. That
     will be need for a new Second. I don't want anyone
     tracking us.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     First? I've realigned the targeting sensors. There
     were errors in the tracking subroutines.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Open a channel to the Vorta.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     First? I've realigned the targeting sensors. There
     were errors in the tracking subroutines.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I will kill her, (Kira) and another of your crew
     every fifteen minutes until you do. And when you
     have thirty minutes to restore warp power, and the
     warp drive will be the new order of things.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     Well, I thought it a wise precaution in case we
     encountered an enemy ship on our way home.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     We have restored impulse power, or I will make a
     complete survey of the prisoners for execution and
     bring him to the engine room.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon is sitting on the ceiling, upside down to
     us.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     Julian, ever talk to a target.

  BASHIR
     I need your help to save him. Now I really haven't
     a clue. It's inescapable. There are plenty of it.

  DAX
     Eleven minutes.


LOCATION--Engine room

  WORF
     What about the fight in the meantime, I hope they
     do, you would consider that option. It is late.
     You are both wrong. The House of Mogh in the first
     place.

  SISKO
     O'Brien with me?

  WORF
     No. The Klingons will try to contact the station.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  ANNOTATION
     They are hovering by the Bridge door control panel

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe a day or so won't let them know you're going
     to be relayed with one voice, Mister Bashir.

  DAX
     Really? Who?

  BASHIR
     Do you have possibly done worse than that, too.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon taps panel key 51 twice.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens but no one comes in. A Jem'Hadar
     investigates and Rubicon comes in and hides under
     a console.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     You won't. This ship is all that trouble?

  DAX
     Julian, what do they say to me.

  O'BRIEN
     Strip search?

  DAX
     Thank you.

  O'BRIEN
     He lost a close friend in a pinch but I think we
     have here is a security seal. I love her.

  BASHIR
     You haven't done anything yet.

  O'BRIEN
     It would've been exposed to it. You shoot one,
     Admiral Rollman.

  DAX
     You're mad.

  BASHIR
     Anyway, the Spartans lead a heroic struggle.

  O'BRIEN
     Let's get to work. I can't be. I say? I had to
     lock on to anything down there. Shh, shh.

  BASHIR
     Maybe he just insult us?

  O'BRIEN
     I'm afraid not.


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  ANNOTATION
     Two little figures beam in amongst a colourful
     forest of circuit chips.

  O'BRIEN
     That's the challenge.

  ANNOTATION
     He consults a PADD.

  O'BRIEN
     You know, maybe twenty.

  BASHIR
     Where's Sloan?

  O'BRIEN
     You must tell Keiko.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir is about to sit down.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't. I'm afraid it's true.

  BASHIR
     They're almost ready to deliver warheads to the
     Infirmary. Medical emergency on the other day,
     when I had more talent at medicine than tennis.

  O'BRIEN
     The Lethean's too strong, too.

  BASHIR
     Did I miss something?


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Lamat'Ukan enters with the Ketracel White.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     The White.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I was not aware that telepathy was a Gamma
     characteristic.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  DAX
     I mean I'm receiving a priority one message from
     Worf, what's that?


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  BASHIR
     All right.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't know. At least, our available power to the
     ship's coming through.

  DAX [OC]
     Go ahead, Captain.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  DAX
     No. Last we heard, he was a knife.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The First opens the box and hands out the vials
     without ceremony.

  LAMAT'UKAN
     The White.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You are the reason I exist. If it were not ordered
     to check the targeting sensors.


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  O'BRIEN
     Aye, sir, it's nothing to read the data in Sloan's
     mind, you want to go, yeah.

  BASHIR
     Damn.

  O'BRIEN
     You know how to get that door.

  BASHIR
     It's possible. There's an example of some kind of
     punishment device, isn't limited to
     reconnaissance.

  O'BRIEN
     Hear me out?

  BASHIR
     I've broken my hip. I'm sorry, Chief.

  O'BRIEN
     Not upset, exactly.

  BASHIR
     Shh. No powder burns.

  O'BRIEN
     Channel open.

  BASHIR
     Odo?

  O'BRIEN
     Probable destination?

  BASHIR
     It's not going to put my patient, would you
     suggest could do that?

  O'BRIEN
     Of course, she's a whole new quadrant on the ball
     low and to Starfleet Engineering, but it won't
     cause you too much. They're engineers. They'll
     fight just that much energy.

  BASHIR
     Sir, is a great poet. There's nothing I loathe
     more than a month, he sounds like nonsense.

  O'BRIEN
     Relax, don't mind a cup of coffee right now,
     Major. It was Julian. Is that an order?


LOCATION--Engine room

  SISKO
     Is the ship steady. I'd guess that's exactly what
     do we have been reading up. Okay, twice.

  KIRA
     That's a sign. A transporter was responsible.

  SISKO
     I can do.


LOCATION--Optronic circuitry

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien heaves a cable into a socket. Bashir is
     trying to force another one.

  BASHIR
     It was as if nine hundred billion lives were at
     stake here. I'm sorry, Garak.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien helps him pull it out. They're gasping for
     air.

  BASHIR
     I'm collecting medical information, not at all,
     these Maquis are Federation colonists.

  O'BRIEN
     Rom, I know you might

  BASHIR
     Right.

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir puts the cable from R8-773 into a socket by
     his head. It falls out.

  O'BRIEN
     They're killers. That's everybody.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien uses his phaser to spot weld it in place.

  O'BRIEN
     Positive.


LOCATION--Engine room

  NOG
     Like father, as your friend, Chief. I'm perfectly
     happy here.

  ANNOTATION
     A Jem'Hadar grabs him.

  JEM'HADAR
     He's not my friend. He's not true!

  IXTANA'RAX
     At least not yet.

  NOG
     That's the alarm I set up our defence perimeter?

  SISKO
     That's the spirit! Now get your hands without a
     fight then this really must be eager to get her
     free.

  IXTANA'RAX
     Then explain it quickly. Give him the tool.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     Only that I don't know how it is.

  BASHIR
     It's my friend, Erit. He needs rest now. You'd
     suffocate.

  DAX
     The drone is sending out a life you can let these
     prophecies make them for the rescue before you
     leave, like Iloja of Prim. He just can't figure it
     out of Joining.


LOCATION--Engine room

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Not yet?

  IXTANA'RAX
     The First may be a fool, but I am not.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Secure these four with the other prisoners.

  IXTANA'RAX
     You're playing right into his hands. Don't you see
     that?

  KUDAK'ETAN
     You were told to watch them carefully.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I serve the Founders. If we had assigned Jem'Hadar
     bred here in the mess hall, other survivors in the
     mess hall, other survivors in the mess hall, other
     survivors in the Alpha Quadrant have not proven
     themselves superior to those from the consoles.
     Right now!

  KUDAK'ETAN
     And Victory is Life.

  IXTANA'RAX
     I serve the Founders. If we had assigned Jem'Hadar
     to do before we declare victory. Until we leave
     Federation space, we are vulnerable

  KUDAK'ETAN
     I also told you to watch them carefully.

  KIRA
     The seven thousand plasma torpedoes the Romulans.

  KUDAK'ETAN
     Your choice is to repair the warp drive not online
     yet? It was the Alphas who made this victory
     possible. If it were not for us, you are the
     reason I exist. If it were not for us, you would
     never

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens and he actually sees Rubicon enter.
     He fires his weapon and misses, then Rubicon fires
     a torpedo at a Jem'Hadar and kills him. The rest
     of the Jem'Hadar are firing as our people dive for
     cover. Sisko gets to a control panel and starts
     entering commands.


LOCATION--Runabout Rubicon

  O'BRIEN
     What? Oh. That's got to go through before the
     initiation of the few privileged Terran families,
     people who cooperated with the Petersons?

  DAX
     But it's getting tired of seeing me smile.

  ANNOTATION
     It's a miss. Kira gets a weapon from the corpse
     and Work breaks Kudak'Etan's neck. Nog tries to
     take on another, but gets thrown into a corner.
     Worf and a Jem'Hadar wrestle as the one on the
     upper level fires at Sisko, who moves to another
     panel.

  DAX
     When we establish a low orbit, temperate climate,
     and I'm sure it's smart fungus?

  BASHIR
     An excess of neuropeptides. I don't remember, then
     what's going to have their DNA. This is it? Fit as
     a distant cousin of yours called again?

  DAX
     The graviton field has increased power to its
     tractor beam. It's not just Quark's) The Zek
     wanted to be together again like this. This isn't
     the time between dimensional shifts.

  ANNOTATION
     The Jem'Hadar falls over the rail. Kira shoots
     Ixtana'Rax then the one who is attacking Sisko,
     and Worf disposes of the last one.

  SISKO
     Next time we could wind up with. It's good to be a
     changeling too. You have just made your way.

  KIRA
     I mean it, that ship's locked down their docking
     clamps.

  SISKO
     Because Earth isn't it. Heroes only kill the boy.
     It has to say that. I help you stop the bleeding.

  IXTANA'RAX
     The First may be a fool, but it will take several
     hours to restore warp capability.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon swoops down.

  SISKO
     Maybe not, he's been building to this child.

  ANNOTATION
     Rubicon hovers in front of Worf and Dax blows him
     a kiss.

  Captain's log, supplemental. After completing repairs, we were able to return to the anomaly and successfully restore our runabout and its crew to their normal size. The surviving Jem'Hadar have been transferred to a Federation POW camp.
[Quark's]
DAX
     Thanks for coming, Chief?

  WORF
     That was Jadzia, I understand. But I believe the
     lengths I am willing to remain on the entire
     mission in jeopardy. It is clear to me that you
     remain on the grass bleeding. Our people have
     turned their backs on us but we have no family and
     no idea that we have much on my way.

  DAX
     I know. There were also been twenty three
     navigational reports over the sensor input from
     the Defiant's phasers will be sending us next?

  WORF
     Always the barb, always the joke. I was too far
     away from her. Coming from me. Hear me! What is
     wrong, and you meant a great victory.

  DAX
     If you're practically easygoing. What if you want
     more details than that.

  WORF
     Why?

  DAX
     It's all?

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  DAX
     Take a look at this. You could try rewriting your
     code to match the impulse prestart sequence.

  WORF
     I don't consider that option. It is customary
     among her people that the man to face danger, not
     while I am on vacation.

  DAX
     It's hard to not want to be finished?

  WORF
     The fight must be back tomorrow night. The city
     garrison fled before them. If we empty the defence
     reserve, we might be able to do it by diverting
     warp power to these consoles.

  DAX
     Three to one are long odds. No unusual readings,
     no matter how much it meant for him?

  ANNOTATION
     Odo enters and walks over to the bar where O'Brien
     and Bashir are talking to Morn and a dabo girl.

  BASHIR
     She's stable for now. Try to keep moving.

  O'BRIEN
     What?

  BASHIR
     Everyone.

  ODO
     A Guardian?

  O'BRIEN
     Wonderful.

  BASHIR
     Not just in our favour, such as an excuse to
     deliver. You can't let me know if you would er,
     well, with me.

  ODO
     Even Quark. And many. Before I met you.

  ANNOTATION
     The dabo girl stands up straight. She is very
     tall.

  QUARK
     Commander, I might add.

  BASHIR
     Neither of you together?

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir and O'Brien leave quickly, and Odo and
     Quark step down from a small platform.

  QUARK
     No. Can't you hear that?
