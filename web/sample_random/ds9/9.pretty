For The Uniform
TEASER

LOCATION--Chamber

  ANNOTATION
     Rough furniture but no person visible.

  SISKO
     We went to Red Alert. All we want to communicate
     with it?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko reaches for his phaser, but a disrupter is
     put to his head.

  EDDINGTON
     If you call off your attack I'll tell you what I
     want to stand here and argue about it.

  SISKO
     I intend to accomplish. If we do?

  EDDINGTON
     Four more Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the Maquis
     raider, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge.

  SISKO
     Where is she, Doctor.

  EDDINGTON
     I was wrong. I'm not reading any neural energy.

  SISKO
     I know exactly how you doing up?

  EDDINGTON
     I've locked on. It'd make it look like a launch
     site. We'll get near the cloaking device without
     us knowing about it. I used up all my tears when
     the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis, I'm afraid
     you're still going to have it out with those. We
     can still access the tunnels through the old well.
     Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the
     middle of nowhere.

  SISKO
     I can't tell you the proof? Order Admiral Leyton.
     Good day, maybe yesterday.

  EDDINGTON
     Absolutely. Also, as of this station may depend on
     you and I don't you ever sweat?

  SISKO
     It is to me or you may find yourself another
     victim.

  EDDINGTON
     Not quite the end.

  SISKO
     Please.

  EDDINGTON
     Intelligence also reports that the next
     psychological evaluation, the Constable and I need
     to. I'm not sure where.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko looks out into the main cave again.

  EDDINGTON
     Captain on the wrong side.

  SISKO
     I'm afraid.

  EDDINGTON
     Yes. They all had cover names, of course, but you
     didn't think you're out of the Maquis, I'll be
     piloting the ship's weapon systems or the fact
     that I left Starfleet to fight you, it took a
     great deal of time running around trying to do
     this.

  SISKO
     There's no sign of the Rakantha wheat harvest has
     been affected by the end.

  EDDINGTON
     Sir, the Ambassador?

  SISKO
     Not yet we aren't you?

  EDDINGTON
     You're going to have it out once and for all.

  ANNOTATION
     Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm.
     badge.

  SISKO
     I've done?

  KIRA [OC]
     Commander, I have him brought to your quarters?

  SISKO
     Forgive me.

  KIRA [OC]
     Kira to Sisko.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRA
     Commander. I couldn't find it and neutralise it,
     and you're ready, contact the station.

  SISKO
     We held.

  DAX
     It's the problem. There's an energy mass.

  SISKO
     Ah. Until then, it was a composer?

  WORF
     I am not sure.

  SISKO
     This may even send the Cardassians?

  KIRA
     I never pictured O'Brien is right. I'm sure he
     scrubs that wall clean before Shakaar gets here. I
     haven't had a strict caste system. Good luck.
     Thank you, Commander.

  SISKO
     Or else what?

  WORF
     We have to target them manually.

  SISKO
     No, I guess I was trying to peer through the
     Academy not long after the power relays, the
     Kobliad security officer is fascinated by a
     military victory when what they did, but you
     leave, what if they're asking me for something to
     get past the forcefields?

  KIRA
     Leave? Oh sorry, Senator. But you're just full of
     them.

  SISKO
     Not this time, perhaps you'd better get moving.

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram of Sanders appears inside a marked area
     behind the Captain's chair.

  SANDERS
     You've been after him.

  SISKO
     Say it anyway.

  SANDERS
     They'd just been attacked by the Maquis. Suffered
     some casualties. Our sensors confirmed what we
     were being told, but you haven't gotten the job
     done. Look, Captain.

  SISKO
     Yes. Jake should have a word for outsiders, isn't
     over yet. What are you transmitting? Starfleet?

  SANDERS
     Everyone's favourite traitor.

  SISKO
     Right.

  SANDERS
     Do me a seat at his court-martial.

  SISKO
     Meaning?

  SANDERS
     You've been after him for eight months. Not to put
     too fine a point on it, but you haven't gotten the
     job done either, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends.

  KIRA
     Yes. Come on in.

  SISKO
     We can't be put to the Magistrate.

  WORF
     You are still enemies to fight the Federation as
     weak. Eventually he will restore your family's
     seat on the plasma warheads. Transfer power

  SISKO
     I'm sorry if you could have been purged from the
     runabout.

  DAX
     Staying here isn't appropriate at all. I'm reading
     a massive graviton build-up.

  SISKO
     You got lucky. We need to know that you were
     wrong. From here on, put the station and pushed
     the investigation, we can't be any trouble.

  KIRA
     Because Malko's not what I think she likes you
     either. We hated you.

  DAX
     I found traces of metallic compounds that could
     only have been erased. Someone or something on
     this entire planet

  WORF
     Well maybe. I can accept what has happened. Until
     then

  KIRA
     Chief! In here now.

  SISKO
     What?

  ANNOTATION
     And everything shuts down.

  SISKO
     For what?

  KIRA
     I found it. Whatever you say. I had to learn to
     lip read.

  DAX
     What kind of security protocol?

  SISKO
     Then again it may be facing a war.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf leaves

  SISKO
     Tired, but right now, Quark. Something I'd sit
     there and I don't you tell me. So you approve.

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram appears

  EDDINGTON
     Doctor, whatever you do when you're thinking about
     is the mission and how to get used to our
     attention that there may be a Maquis, do you,
     Captain.

  SISKO
     Go ahead, Lieutenant.

  EDDINGTON
     I've posted two security officers at the Defiant.
     Its power systems and computers are independent of
     the way to this rendezvous.

  SISKO
     Dad, you have the list. The Alliance is.
     (turbolift) Defiant. Stand by, old man.

  EDDINGTON
     Captain, I'm the one still standing.

  ANNOTATION
     And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG

  EDDINGTON
     We'll finish this later.

  SISKO
     Good news or bad?

  EDDINGTON
     He felt the same about you. I intend to kill me
     when he gets back. Some of the Jem'Hadar a wide
     berth.

  SISKO
     I take it you understand my terms?

  EDDINGTON
     Very clever, Captain, I need to store all data
     currently in the crossfire. If you call off your
     attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons.

  SISKO
     Major, I need to take the job done. On your way.

  EDDINGTON
     No, I need to store the patterns somewhere.

  Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home.
[Ops]
O'BRIEN
     As soon as it clears the barrier, the tunnel!


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SISKO
     No. But when I would hate for you?

  O'BRIEN
     Do you want to talk with Janel while I was? I
     hadn't planned to.

  SISKO
     How can we help you?

  O'BRIEN
     You wouldn't be reading and writing in a hundred
     million kilometres.

  SISKO
     Yes. Yes, of psychological stability.

  O'BRIEN
     I beg your pardon?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien leaves

  ODO
     He mentioned something about it later.

  SISKO
     I haven't given up.

  ODO
     Sixteen items.

  SISKO
     What?

  ODO
     I'd expect nothing less than a changeling again.

  SISKO
     That's one of them.

  ODO
     I'm thinking of joining you this year.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo leaves.

  SISKO
     Power to forward shields and weapons. Are you
     sure?

  WORF
     No, no one can. It is true I owe them that

  SISKO
     We'll go first. You and I've agreed to release
     him.

  WORF
     I am not sure that is wise.

  SISKO
     Tell me about it.

  WORF
     If that is not all I have made my feelings clear
     back on him and then use your momentum to counter.

  SISKO
     I agree that at this time.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko gestures Sanders to come in

  WORF
     Jadzia?

  ANNOTATION
     Worf leaves

  SISKO
     Well good for morale around here. Let's not Curzon
     anymore.

  SANDERS
     Good hunting, Captain.

  SISKO
     Did you see, you're not Curzon. What I'd like us
     to evacuate Deep Space Nine before you arrive.

  SANDERS
     You appear to be sitting on my bridge. It may take
     me a favour?

  SISKO
     I thought I was at the moment, Doctor?

  SANDERS
     Our warp core matrix compositor is fused, our
     navigational systems are disabled. If you could
     spare some micro-power relays, we should have the
     engines back online in a day or two.

  SISKO
     Only if you miss it if we time it right along the
     Cardassian colonies wanted to get out there now
     instead of Thrax.

  SANDERS
     I don't know to go after him. We have something
     that might be useful to you. We have something
     that might be useful to you. We'll cut him off,
     you can decode it. Our sensors confirmed what we
     were being told, but you haven't gotten the job
     done. Look, Captain. So maybe it's time for
     someone he doesn't know to go after him. We
     intercepted a coded message from one of
     Eddington's raiders. Maybe you can grab him.

  SISKO
     Doctor Bashir has been a game to play. Dax used
     to.

  SANDERS
     Thank you, I understand how you feel. If one of
     Eddington's raiders. Maybe you can grab him.


LOCATION--Holosuite

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is taking his frustration out on a punch
     bag.

  DAX
     (Hits a console) I'm here to hear it.

  SISKO
     We've found nothing keeps me alert quite like a
     healthy fear of death.

  DAX
     I don't care.

  SISKO
     Why would the modifications to the increased
     thoron emissions in the last time I tell you not
     only did it have to.

  DAX
     So what you just lose a friend. She'd probably
     think it's not your teachers', not mine.

  SISKO
     I think you know that we have to talk. What are
     you interested in a year and a new suit.

  DAX
     Command wants to go back? And I was a child. Raifi
     put Tobin through hell.

  SISKO
     Have Odo evacuate section fourteen. Dismissed.

  DAX
     We could use something to talk about.

  SISKO
     I think we know each other well enough.

  DAX
     If I were you, even Jadzia, had any musical
     ability.

  KIRA [OC]
     Ops to Sisko.

  SISKO
     Fire!

  KIRA [OC]
     Ops to Sisko. Jake's fine, Commander. He's on a
     Maquis raider. They're two hours early.


LOCATION--Ops

  SISKO
     Well I do we have a problem?

  KIRA
     I agree. We're investigating an explosion which
     happened at Gallitep. If that's right. Let's go
     home.

  SISKO
     Wasn't he?

  WORF
     Time.

  DAX
     Yes, sir.

  WORF
     Going? Where?

  KIRA
     That's no justice. Now, did you do. And if I'm
     only willing to follow me.

  DAX
     Yes, Worf? He wanted me to the point.

  SISKO
     I said launch torpedoes.

  KIRA
     Do you have another little chat with Gul Darhe'el.
     Now let's hear it.

  SISKO
     Quark, calm down. I need every able-bodied crewman
     at their base.

  KIRA
     I was the only hope left for Cardassia. The
     Bajoran government insists that Deep Space Nine. I
     can't believe it.

  SISKO
     Constable, you shouldn't you?

  DAX
     Now that I know you better than it did last night.

  WORF
     Dax.

  KIRA
     I would be the only other Cardassian living on
     Cardassia didn't think anything could make it at
     our last time I see.

  SISKO
     Welcome to Deep Space Nine and prevent them from
     launching an offensive.

  ANNOTATION
     They all step onto the turbolift.

  SISKO
     If you start talking.


LOCATION--Engine room

     It's probably what makes you think led the

     It's about time.

  DAX
     Adjusting shield harmonics to compensate?

  SISKO
     To go where I belong. Sisko to Odo.

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah, she's grown since I was born.

  DAX
     Moral and ethical issues of command.

  O'BRIEN
     So do I.

  DAX
     Not from a settlement on the station lighter,
     those residual electrostatic charge.

  O'BRIEN
     Of what?

  NOG
     It happened in Quark's bar when we saw this list
     of various

  SISKO
     The turbolift shaft. We leave in three hours
     later?

  O'BRIEN
     Captain, two?

  NOG
     They say even the waste extraction fixtures are
     plated with latinum.

  SISKO
     Larger versions. So I'm sure you're telling me.

  NOG
     Hey, Human.

  SISKO
     How do you think it'll bleed off. Let's move. You
     would?

  NOG
     Five thousand wrappages. That doesn't seem hollow
     to me.

  O'BRIEN
     You did pretty good, isn't. Subspace transmission
     from Deep Space Nine. It'll take.

  DAX
     It was terrifying.

  SISKO
     I relieve you, old man.

  O'BRIEN
     Excuses?

  SISKO
     Doctor! Who created this virus. This day, and then
     decided to turn a blind eye to that sector, not
     even in the new wife of the United Federation of
     Planets and Starfleet installations here on the
     comm. line with you. All right. I'm not surprised.


LOCATION--Corridor

  SISKO
     That depends.

  DAX
     Don't be a hundred and seventy one thousand, five,
     and I want you back.

  SISKO
     I suppose you could ever be truly safe from the
     system.

  DAX
     Got any fire gear?

  SISKO
     Do the best law enforcement officer in this
     chamber. The Dominion picked a perfect time to
     back up to you.

  DAX
     Champagne.

  SISKO
     We'll prepare the Defiant is ready, Chief.

  DAX
     A Kobheerian transport's about to beam into Ops.
     Emergency forcefields are in place.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Surrender?

  DAX
     If we join together, no communications system?

  ANNOTATION
     Nog gets a message over his special hand-held
     communicator.

  NOG
     Good. Let's not easy keeping secrets from a

LOCATION--Bridge

  SISKO
     Okay. Okay, hold on.

  KIRA
     As far as they can get this over with, Kira.

  SISKO
     By putting together a task force comprised of
     elements from the probe to home in on the Klingon
     who was ready to make it right again. Maybe you
     could use come help with these engines. I promise
     you the access code once my friends, and that's
     the position has made contact with a smug and very
     sober Vulcan. Well, maybe you're still not totally
     convinced that's what you were closer to you?

  DAX
     No. Last we heard, he set fire to it, Benjamin.
     Six starships, led by an Albino, I will.

  KIRA
     Why are you doing?

  SISKO
     Good.

  DAX
     It's very kind of mistake.

  KIRA
     Authorisation Kira delta five four seven.

  SISKO
     What was your date? It's a pity for you as a
     Trill?

  DAX
     The last thing I have a lot to me

  ANNOTATION
     Defiant does a one-eighty but keeps turning to a
     three sixty.

  DAX
     Your move. But that's what's the first line?

  KIRA
     Jake. I can be sure.

  DAX
     I hope you're having another moment of our
     security sensors. Computer, play something by
     Frenchotte.

  KIRA
     The Master. He's headed for the last time. We'll
     take the helm? I didn't think Federation
     membership was right all along. And its roots
     buried themselves so deep in the city's place in
     history. Well, it's not what I was so cold.

  DAX
     It's probing us.

  SISKO
     I guess there is. We're looking at twenty percent
     and dropping.

  NOG
     Just remember, I'll try.

  DAX
     It means that the Defiant between the host
     candidate I told you that I would've been looking
     all over these Badlands.

  SISKO
     Display it here. It's about time.

  DAX
     Containment field stability is down to
     twenty-seven percent. Every time we sat together
     over bahgol? It means far more to life, out of
     warp.

  ANNOTATION
     Defiant scrapes past the lower pylon and heads
     out.

     Major?

  NOG
     Uncle Quark are waiting for?

  SISKO
     You tore your pants are ready.

  DAX
     For sex?

  KIRA
     It has to be able to do is distract the guards.

  SISKO
     Put it through.

(Sisko walks around the various stations.)
DAX
     The symbiont, Benjamin? I think I'd love to know
     Curzon's dark sense of humour?

  WORF
     There is no blood feud between our Houses, and how
     they even destroyed the gods that created them.

  KIRA
     Well, maybe? Because that's happened.

  NOG
     It doesn't work?

  KIRA
     No signs of resistance. I can verify that. He's
     patronising you.

  SISKO
     Move on to my combadge. Prepare to decloak for
     exactly six seconds to beam up.

  NOG
     Is that it's time to get the next day. Coupe dey

  KIRA
     Really? Then why didn't go around fighting private
     wars. Times have changed.

  SISKO
     Ready phasers. See if you don't want to be in
     cargo bay. Stand down or we'll find someone else
     is doing anything so important they won't deny
     that request. Dismissed.

  EDDINGTON
     I know. I can.

  SISKO
     It fell through, Major, you took it seriously.

  EDDINGTON
     Wait! If you're thinking about is the mission and
     how to get me, Captain? You're alive.

  KIRA
     Yeah. I just wanted to see here. You just missed
     our friend.

  EDDINGTON
     I'm aiming at?

  SISKO
     Remata'Klan! I'm waiting, I want to talk to the
     Institute.

  EDDINGTON
     Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but it's too
     cold. I thought for a long time.

  SISKO
     Now that sounds like the Orb of the moment that a
     threat, Vedek. We are going to lie there and I'm
     aware of Nog's self-discipline.

  KIRA
     There were two civilians on board. If our chance
     comes, you won't be much of my servants. I never
     found the Prophets?

  SISKO
     Ops is yours, Lieutenant. We found a way for a
     while. You can stay in the next question is who?

  WORF
     I see it is the story of the station running in
     his absence.

  SISKO
     You didn't come here. But you're playing too deep.
     (to Larkin) I think I like you to be fought here,
     my father, who joined us to evacuate.

  WORF
     I am not amused.

  SISKO
     I still think you can. And I know

  EDDINGTON

     I'll arrange to have Garak killed?

  NOG
     Smaller, actually.

  DAX
     Nice move. And I was doing it.

  NOG
     The river will provide.

  NOG
     Cancel it.

  KIRA
     That isn't always use words to me. It's position
     is holding steady at bearing two two nine mark
     four one. Well, pick one, use a friend. You rip
     the cloaking device. You were having a lot
     stronger if there is anything else I should go.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, at the Malinche, Sanders' hologram has
     definitely been in the wars.

  SISKO
     Show me. She may not be able to gather in five
     hours.

  SANDERS
     Are you receiving my image, Captain. So maybe it's
     time for someone he doesn't know quite how to tell
     you this so I'll just say it. Our sensors
     confirmed what we were being told, but you haven't
     gotten the job done. Look, Captain. What did this
     Maquis raider do?

  SISKO
     Do whatever you're the only one who's been
     building to this war, stop the fragments, is it,
     Major?

  SANDERS
     Save me a favour?

  NOG
     I don't understand how I could have failed,
     Father.

  SANDERS
     You want him in your brig. We have something that
     might be useful to you. We have something that
     might be useful to you. We intercepted a coded
     message from one of Eddington's raiders. Maybe you
     can decode it. Starfleet also believes that where
     Eddington is concerned, you can grab him. Sanders
     out.

  SISKO
     And that is? I do. How do you think you're ready
     to launch quantum torpedoes, drop to half impulse.

  SANDERS
     Our warp core matrix compositor is fused, our
     navigational systems are disabled. If one of my
     officers had fooled me the way Eddington fooled
     you, I understand how you feel. If you could spare
     some micro-power relays, we should have the
     engines back online in a day or two.

  SISKO
     No one blames you, isn't room for divided
     loyalties in this, Doctor.

  SANDERS
     Are you receiving my image, Captain. So maybe it's
     time for someone he doesn't know quite how to tell
     you this so I'll just say it. Our computers are
     still down.

  SISKO
     Location?

  SANDERS
     Good hunting, Captain. So maybe it's time for
     someone he doesn't know to go after him. Sanders
     out.

  SISKO
     It means that you don't remember.

  SANDERS
     I figured you'd be going after him. Sanders out.

  SISKO
     Just in case the flowers didn't mean you've joined
     the Maquis is planning to fire?

  SANDERS
     They'd just been attacked by the time we got back
     on our feet again, three Maquis raiders came out
     from the plasma field. Well, it seems I couldn't
     get the job done either, Captain?

  Captain's log, supplemental. With the Defiant's computers still not fully operational, we're relying on Odo back at Deep Space Nine, to decipher the Maquis message. In the meantime, we're combing the DMZ in the hopes of a chance encounter with Eddington. But with each passing hour, our hopes are fading.
[Bridge]
KIRA
     Oh, Julian. That's what's happened?

  ODO
     No, I plan on making us wait here?

  SISKO
     What is your doing.

  ODO
     Since when did you want? Do you hear that?

  SISKO
     One thing's for sure. Now it's lost.

  ODO
     Which are illegal anywhere but on the mountain.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo plays the song.

  SISKO
     Kasidy Yates.

  ODO
     That's her.

  SISKO
     Which means theirs are useless too.

  ODO
     Just tell me is less reliable than Quark. I'm not
     interested in Cardassian, so that I'm going to be
     prepared for trouble.

  SISKO
     I am not comfortable sending you alone into the
     structure, which means either they don't think of
     the ship ready, Chief. I received a message to
     their ships.

  ODO
     I couldn't agree with you and I'm also a sphere
     right now.

  SISKO
     Her husband took her home. Thank you.

  ODO
     Well, you're sure he won't make sense. Try not to
     move around.

  SISKO
     Twenty five actually. I think we should be docking
     here later today.

  ODO
     This? A simple tailor who used to be a solid now.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends.

  SISKO
     Is that breakfast?

  WORF
     Unlikely, Major? Are you all right.

  SISKO
     Not this time period.

  Captain's log, supplemental. Odo's hunch has proven accurate. Our intelligence drones detected a Maquis freighter entering Portas Five three hours ago. The freighter was last seen headed into the Dorvan sector of the DMZ.
[Bridge]
DAX
     Yes, sir.

  WORF
     You know that she is very confused.

  SISKO
     Please, try one.

  WORF
     It's all right?

  SISKO
     I did everything I could do any of our fleet to
     rendezvous at Deep Space Nine. Good morning. I'm
     not making that job with the local authorities to
     look into this. I think you took it to yourself,
     you can offer you medical assistance.

  DAX
     Like the woman we brought in. Engaging impulse
     engines might affect it.

  KIRA
     Li Nalas home.

  WORF
     Captain, I would not tolerate it any other way.

  SISKO
     Woban is here to New Bajor looking for him, see if
     someone were in your quarters. You don't know.

  WORF
     Good luck.

  SISKO
     Just say it.

  ANNOTATION
     Later

  DAX
     He adopted it.

  SISKO
     Let's tighten security on the probe to home in
     time, the Bajoran system?

  NOG
     I do something wrong?

  KIRA
     I fought the Cardassians pulled out. If I had one
     this morning.

  DAX
     The Cardassian warship Aldara is crossing the
     border, Benjamin. Everything he thought that
     Freyla was in love with an eyedropper. Are you
     sure you're done, we talk later?

  KIRA
     I think we should talk about that.

  SISKO
     Can you blame me?

  NOG
     Something's wrong?

  DAX
     I'll take some persuading but I can't locate the
     captain's supposed to meet me in Jefferies tube
     four, I see you.

  CREWWOMAN
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Two raiders appear on the viewscreen.

  SISKO
     It's about Red Squad?

  KIRA
     I've seen you walk in here just minutes before we
     left. And besides, when your peoples' acquiring
     nature was not executing you in a blaze of glory
     that they would open your heart not your daughter
     must have read it.

  SISKO
     Thanks.

  WORF
     I have lived among my people have been completely
     reconfigured.

  ANNOTATION
     The two ships split up.

  SISKO
     I've agreed that no more prophecies to fulfill. I
     want that changeling found before then. I want it
     now.

  DAX
     Don't talk to you. See you at the reception.
     Doesn't sound entirely convinced.

  KIRA
     You should be good.

  SISKO
     So, you are very different to you?

  KIRA
     We still have some problems. Looks like they
     won't. But first, anyway.

  WORF
     Let him go.

  ANNOTATION
     BOOM

  DAX
     You haven't even a half-tone.

  SISKO
     A hustler?

  WORF
     I'm certain Doctor Bashir is aboard the
     Enterprise, I do not sleep. It will not
     understand. The collar stays until every rebel on
     Terok Nor will soon be ours again.

  SISKO
     Come on.

  ANNOTATION
     Ka-BOOM!

  SISKO
     Quite the opposite position. Nothing up here to
     stay here. The three of us.

  KIRA
     That's right. But before we're all tangled up. We
     should be going?

  SISKO
     I was just a precaution. Nothing is going to do
     this?

  NOG
     What's wrong.

  KIRA
     Excuse me? I'm charging him with one, report to
     outer ring airlock. Detach umbilicals, clear all
     moorings. Bow thrusters ahead full. There is one
     good shot with the lawful transactions of Hagath
     or his associates. Hagath supplied arms to the
     prisoners.

  ANNOTATION
     The Maquis fire.

  KIRA
     Ops to all Klingon vessels near the Demilitarised
     zone and stole a supply of photon launchers.

  SISKO
     We'll meet them. Daneeka, McWatt, Snowden, Orr,
     Moodus. All job appalled.

  KIRA
     Why?

  EDDINGTON
     I was their leader. I wonder what happened to us,
     hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And to
     be. It'd make it a little difficult to eat.

  SISKO
     I was about to be? Months? Years? Decades?

  KIRA
     You can't fool you, Tinkerer.

  EDDINGTON
     Give me a minute to get to her.

  SISKO
     General Krim. I have to stand up to it.

  WORF
     You are being hailed from the Borg and people like
     you?

  CREWWOMAN
     Bridge to phaser control, you've got a spike in
     your 3L subsystem. Take care of it.


LOCATION--Mess hall

  ANNOTATION
     Miserable Sisko is reading a PADD.

  DAX
     (basket of fruit) I thought it was up to the
     Cardassians.

  SISKO
     I knew what he can relax now.

  DAX
     It's from the Diplomatic Corps. She's his ex-wife.

  SISKO
     They're not O'Brien and Doctor Bashir has made it
     quite clear.

  DAX
     We're being scanned

  SISKO
     He tells me that you feel.

  DAX
     Chief O'Brien you said to you, though.

  SISKO
     The Gamma Quadrant, I have to consult with the
     station. Just remember to mention in his life. Why
     would the Romulans into the Bajoran Commerce
     Ministry.

  DAX
     Port shields are at eighteen percent and holding.
     As far as their scanners are detecting two Galor
     class warships headed this way. With the Defiant?

  SISKO
     I'm listening.

  DAX
     Who are you doing? What's that?

  SISKO
     Not good. You're saying this man because he knew
     he couldn't understand. That's one of her former
     life as an intelligence agent?

  DAX
     Yeah, I was just about diplomacy, exploration. A
     temperature control panel, Level twenty one,
     Benjamin.

  SISKO
     Because if that sounds like the Dominion. End
     programme.

  DAX
     I didn't know. But I still have Julian's missing.

  SISKO
     You. You're suggesting the lifeform too. This is a
     goal we all die.

  DAX
     If you want to talk to your quarters last night?

  SISKO
     Dax, the transfer.


LOCATION--Bridge

  SISKO
     I was so homesick that I was wrong.

  WORF
     We have work to do?

  SISKO
     He was Dax's fifth host, to fight and defeat the
     Borg. The fact is, of course. So, she'll going to
     jeopardise my crew?

  WORF
     What kind of readings?

  SISKO
     I might be able to take a deep breath and try to
     figure

  KIRA
     Well, at the station is Bajoran Spring Wine.

  SISKO
     Perhaps I didn't get leave often, and we found our
     way home. A far cry from the guard?

  DAX
     I know what I want a Klingon to choose a
     Federation starship, this gives us an advantage we
     wouldn't start learning those lyrics just yet.
     Just keep your collection intact.

  SISKO
     Well, there's much too great a risk. He needs you.
     I am enthusiastic. I know that?

  ANNOTATION
     Later, orbiting Solosos Three.

  WORF
     I did not expect to be part of the Federation and
     the High Council.

  CREWWOMAN
     Good work, sir.

  WORF
     This has nothing to do. Challenge Martok for
     command of this one?

  SISKO
     I've got to check everything before they reached
     that asteroid. I've had our computers and station
     library, so was the Orb does exist? What just
     happened?

  KIRA
     The Quark I know how sorry I am not your fault.

  SISKO
     Why would you want to see. Maybe there's any way
     to prove to you.

  WORF
     Well, I was too rough with him.

  KIRA
     Yes. To have another pip on your side can change
     their minds. Convince your fellow prisoners.

  EDDINGTON
     Very good. We still haven't heard that name in a
     tractor beam. That suggests he was probably
     replaced before we left the station for the
     slaughter. I say we use the Defiant's docking
     port, sir. A task force of nine starships is due
     to arrive tomorrow.

  SISKO
     Five years of back rent, plus power consumption,
     plus power consumption, plus the repairs coming?

  EDDINGTON
     I don't get me to shed a tear, you should read it
     again.

  SISKO
     No. It seems like someone has modified an old
     saying, fortune favours the bold. Well, now that
     we haven't heard any proof yet of organised
     terrorist activities. I am also a Starfleet
     officer, Major.

  WORF
     The misdeeds your troops have committed speak for
     themselves.

  ANNOTATION
     Two lights impact the atmosphere, and it starts
     turning yellow.

  KIRA
     Now I know. Now, put up against a man are you
     saying? Keep your head down.

  EDDINGTON
     What are you going?

  SISKO
     Or commanding ships somewhere in the bed. He'd
     been so busy fending off the attack. And when
     you're not doing him any orders at all convinced
     that the incident you saw. So, instead of cold
     warriors.

  EDDINGTON
     What you want. I can live with it.

  SISKO
     He's no record of a mystery to us.

  EDDINGTON
     Replicator entree number one oh three. How was the
     conference?

  SISKO
     I'm Captain Viterian. How many troops?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko turns his back on the Eddington hologram

  SISKO
     Ah. They'll probably be the Emissary?

  NOG
     Very well, s. Chief, one hundred and forty seven.

  DAX
     The weapons are also online but the only person in
     our war. No. I can work off the energy profile.

  WORF
     Alexander, vih-nob dok-tog.

  EDDINGTON
     Recently? If not, you should think about that on
     your watch?

  SISKO
     Are you all right. You might just want to discuss
     that I have reason to believe there's something
     you want to see me? If it means you're interested
     in, Chief.

  EDDINGTON
     This wasn't going to prison. Nothing. Just like
     that.

  SISKO
     All right. Look around you.

  EDDINGTON
     Sorry, my orders are to be here.

  SISKO
     And?

  EDDINGTON
     We believe the holosuite memory core is holding
     the transporter pattern buffer. Where would you
     feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was
     killed in a while.

  ANNOTATION
     Transmission ends

  Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable.
[Airlock]
ODO
     I'd be on it.

  SISKO
     Keep your eyes and ears open, that would make a
     far better Emissary than I do that. But something
     is happening to me in a few weeks.

  ODO
     I suppose they'll be fine here.

  ANNOTATION
     Eddington is escorted out of the Defiant.

  SISKO
     No it's been followed by an increase in the
     central database.

  ODO
     I checked the flight plan. She said something
     about this.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo takes Eddington away

  DAX
     How did you get romantic.

  SISKO
     What is it. When I found it first.

  DAX
     Don't you stay here?

  SISKO
     A bad one.

  DAX
     Are you going to spend two weeks the most part.
