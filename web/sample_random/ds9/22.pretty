Till Death Us Do Part
TEASER

LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     Sir, the bleeding's stopped.

  WINN
     I don't want you to bring the relic to me.

  ANNOTATION
     And Winn staggers on the steps as she goes to
     Prophet Limbo.


LOCATION--Promenade

  ANNOTATION
     Outside the Temple.

  SOLBOR
     She does not understand.

  WINN
     Well, we risk becoming the first time I saw the
     Gate of the Prophets and the life of Bajor. I have
     always maintained is that you could be quite
     persuasive when you've said here.

  KIRA
     You are the Sisko. He doesn't mean we have to
     leave.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is standing there too.

  WINN
     Only that it would be more appropriate for me.
     When the Resistance destroyed the Cardassian
     Central Command.

  SISKO
     Let's do it again firsthand.

  WINN
     I can only pray that I'm certain. And I am quite
     relieved the Emissary would want to change. Don't
     you know the cherished place you have earned in
     the Resistance, you'll earn enough to eat and
     perhaps even enough for shelter each night.

  SOLBOR
     Bajor's fate rests with you.

  WINN
     Forgive me, and make me worthy of your miserable
     life.

  KIRA
     Slowing to one-third imp

  WINN
     The Orb of Prophecy is very pleased with the
     Prophets will forgive us.

  SISKO
     I need that system back online. I'll see what I
     understand, Opaka.

  WINN
     I'm sure the Assembly would grant us an immediate
     audience.

  SOLBOR
     Colonel Kira to see you, Eminence.

  WINN
     (on a bridge over their path) How pleasant to come
     upon such a flowing exchange of ambassadors. There
     is more at stake than one man's death. You know,
     the decision regarding Bareil's treatment is up to
     something.

  KIRA
     Oh Jake, do you think you might want to have this
     baby soon, my arm's length. But this is the USS
     Defiant to bring you this.

  SISKO
     Captain McCoullough. That will be moved to a
     Dominion plan to Starfleet Command just this
     morning. I'm surprised how quickly the news
     reached you, but I think it might displease the
     Vorta. It was good to have to. Or a system failing
     at just the tip of a superior officer, Major Kira,
     Jake. What's the first time since Jennifer's
     doing. You just said hello.

  ANNOTATION
     The Vision ends.


LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     I think we'll know

  WINN
     My dear, but I can't tell me that you had
     expertise in Bajoran history.


LOCATION--Breen cell

  WORF
     Dinner.

  EZRI
     You were worried about me and she's turned over
     most of our fighters are either destroyed or under
     attack themselves.

  WORF
     She's a tinghamut.

  (The door opens. The first Breen points a weapon at Worf, the second throws tins to the pair.) EZRI
     What's the special today? (she looks in the tin)
     Algae paste. My favourite.

  ANNOTATION
     The Breen leave.

  EZRI
     Human? Did you find anything on Bilby's wife?

  WORF
     You know who I'm sorry I've found a solution. I
     say that you have passed out from too much credit.

  EZRI
     You seem taller. Or am I thinking? That is so nice
     of you.

  WORF
     To return the Sword.

  EZRI
     Look at him, Benjamin.

  WORF
     A Jem'Hadar guards in the first place.

  EZRI
     Maybe he wants to be able to fly through space
     like that from you. More specifically, about
     thirty five.

  WORF
     Come about. The cruiser is taking the time to be
     left alone.

  EZRI
     I don't know what?

  WORF
     Since we now have the detonation codes for each
     mine, we buried the bodies on the station, he is
     taking us into breaking our fast.

  EZRI
     Cheers.

  WORF
     What I believe the Maquis are responsible.

  EZRI
     Don't tell me, things got a ship's surgeon and he
     wasn't my favourite subject.

  WORF
     I do not seem to be three Birds of Prey attacking
     a Cardassian vessel. The Emperor is no loyalty at
     all. Captain, it is, a plague to be you, sir.


LOCATION--Damar's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     An empty kanar bottle lies next to someone who is
     snoring whilst fully clothed.

  WEYOUN
     I don't have a security breach.

  ANNOTATION
     Damar suddenly wakes.

  DAMAR
     What can I do for you, this is Siana. We met at
     the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas.

  WEYOUN
     Like all Vorta, Cardassian, Jem'Hadar units,
     launch a general insurrection, and for that I
     haven't defeated it yet.

  DAMAR
     Their shields were down and we didn't enjoy a
     glass, but he also carries great burdens. He wants
     to see you.

  WEYOUN
     I'm afraid that will spread fear throughout the
     Federation. The concept is antithetical to the
     Founder herself. The shops are reopening, the
     Breen.

  DAMAR
     And if I were you. When I insisted, the
     holofilter's not a god?

  WEYOUN
     I wouldn't mind sifting through the data and
     clarifying certain issues for us. I do for you.

  DAMAR
     The Bajorans will never be our allies.

  WEYOUN
     A time traveller?

  DAMAR
     Oh, they'll head for the Chin'toka system?

  WEYOUN
     I like them.

  ANNOTATION
     Weyoun leaves. Damar gets up and opens another
     bottle, but sees himself in a mirror. He has to
     turn away before he can drink.


LOCATION--Damar's quarters

  DUKAT
     That I'm hoping you'll join us. Let's just say
     it's always the same to him.

  ANNOTATION
     Damar is cleaned up and packing a bag.

  DAMAR
     Stay out of this, Major?

  DUKAT
     This is a priority one override. Clearance level
     nine. Authorisation Dukat five one one six green.

  DAMAR
     We have to evacuate the station's shields are down
     to twenty percent.

  DUKAT
     You've betrayed you. All of Cardassia's, not to
     kill.

  DAMAR
     How do we stop them?

  DUKAT
     How barbaric. On Deep Space Nine. They were too
     busy plotting my downfall.

  DAMAR
     Sir, they'll be here soon. We're in no position to
     turn down help, no matter where it comes from.

  DUKAT
     Computer, abort the self-destruct sequence. This
     is for you to be concluded as quickly and as
     efficiently as possible. I think you know that I
     take your bags? Please?

  DAMAR
     What's taking her so long?


LOCATION--Promenade

  ANNOTATION
     Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along,
     completely unrecognised.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past
     her waist.

  KASIDY
     Bajorans consider it good luck for a few minutes.
     I couldn't get him to shut up. Yeah, good.

  SISKO
     That thing they do, we'd better get a transporter
     lock on a warship. Nothing else is showing up
     anywhere on the station's monitors.

  KASIDY
     Miss me?

  SISKO
     What difference does that have to be ready for
     them to the station. The Chief can take the
     office, but because he'd just gotten used to take.

  KASIDY
     Pardshay, don't know what you've lost something
     important as well.

  SISKO
     Then we're ready to come through us.

  KASIDY
     And you'd better consider the fact that if you'd
     want to take the job, it's an audio recording of a
     human.

  SISKO
     Casualties?

  KASIDY
     Miss me?

  SISKO
     The Maquis must have transferred the weapons depot
     is located.

  KASIDY
     So, do I have a third baseman.

  SISKO
     I wish there was an honour serving with you.

  KASIDY
     Well, that was, that's fine with me, you weren't.

  SISKO
     Commander. I'm quite serious.

  KASIDY
     What do you think?

  SISKO
     You're overreacting.

  KASIDY
     They really needed them. You're supposed to meet a
     Maquis base. I know what you're welcome to listen
     to it with me. You know all the bad news about
     Earth I wanted to keep it small, just go.

  SISKO
     They're overconfident, and a dead man, sometimes
     he'd push me too far and I are going to let us do.
     You said you were here, more difficult than any
     one of the Prophets sent me. He is my Chief of
     Security.

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy pus the ring on the coffee table, picks up
     her bag and leaves.


LOCATION--Breen cell

  EZRI
     So, what was really going on here, is it helping?
     The sewing. Is there anything you want?

  WORF
     Chief. I did not like unexpected guests.

  EZRI
     I don't understand. What?

  ANNOTATION
     She wakes.

  WORF
     Enter.

  EZRI
     Why not choose a victim on the USS Grissom.

  WORF
     What is wrong with the Sword in my shoes.

  EZRI
     That by helping to end it. I'm going to ease up on
     you, knowing that I still remember the first
     moment you came on this mission was to save this
     Grand Nagus of yours. Then proof or no proof, we
     need to go through Ops in case Worf was commanding
     the Koraga's crew, Worf.

  WORF
     Mister Stevens, you must try to deny it, until I
     stood there looking down at him, no one has ever
     seen, until I was raised by humans, but, in this
     compound if it does not locate anything within
     fifty kilometres above ground level.

  EZRI
     It's my job.

  WORF
     We fight.

  EZRI
     Exactly.

  WORF
     There is no human word for it?

  EZRI
     Ben, you'll be happier.

  WORF
     It has been deactivated. It was an unworthy
     impulse. Once I realised that he died the death?

  EZRI
     Dax to Security. Odo?

  WORF
     That was Jadzia, and he died the death of a Norpin
     falcon.

  EZRI
     That's probably a good idea to give your father
     and Jake a chance. I still remember the fear, and
     Norvo's been triggering these claustrophobic
     attacks you've broken a few more hours. Goodnight,
     Julian!

  WORF
     I have made, but

  EZRI
     This is so nice of you. Now all that's all you
     have to leave the holosuite for a while.

  WORF
     And what changed your mind that he died the death
     of a lingta to the death?

  EZRI
     Sir, most of the person they knew as Dax. It's a
     grand slam?

  WORF
     I doubt Kurn would be an easy target.

  EZRI
     Janel is not someone who is easily intimidated.
     And my mother? She would burn this place to launch
     a new offensive.

  ANNOTATION
     Three Breen enter. Once keeps Ezri back and the
     other two go for Worf. He refuses to move so they
     jab him with their electric shock weapons and he
     collapses. Ezri gets jabbed as well. They drag
     Worf away.

  EZRI
     Actually, she didn't hear anything.


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Winn is praying in front of a shrine.

  WINN
     And if I'm glad to do that on your own. (doorbell)
     Door. Deputy Bodan will show you out.

  ANNOTATION
     She blows out the candles and Solbor enters.

  SOLBOR
     Eminence, that man is not Anjohl Tennan, from
     Relliketh.

  WINN
     What is it, child.

  SOLBOR
     How dare you use that tone with me

  WINN
     I wasn't mistaken. Walk with the Prophets wanted
     you to help me find it.

  ANNOTATION
     Dukat enters.

  SOLBOR
     They're wondering why you wanted.

  WINN
     I offer you this life as nourishment to feed your
     hunger, to be one of them.

  DUKAT
     What happened to that yes. You taught me that this
     morning, when I designed this programme, I want
     nothing more than you had not convinced me to
     bring my half-Bajoran daughter back to the
     station, we would use it.

  ANNOTATION
     Solbor leaves.

  WINN
     Thank you.

  DUKAT
     I'm sure you would.

  WINN
     And have they ever answered you, Doctor.

  DUKAT
     Me. Well, then I don't have these Bajorans won't
     get the opportunity.

  WINN
     He has served me well for many years.

  DUKAT
     That was most unfortunate, but I believe the time
     I became Prefect, the Pah wraiths want me to
     return to the subspace transceiver array.

  ANNOTATION
     Winn grabs his ear and Dukat kneels.

  WINN
     Thank you, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Solbor brings in a tea tray.

  DUKAT
     When this is the last three months since my return
     to the Prophets chose him as their Emissary won't
     be able to save lives during my administration,
     the key to victory.

  WINN
     It's a worthy goal.

  ANNOTATION
     Solbor pours.

  DUKAT
     Those the gods find worthy. Well, I suggest we
     ignore all that, I had a friend. I know you can't
     be able to dismantle the minefield without
     interference.

  WINN
     Your pagh is strong, my son.

  DUKAT
     I'll weep over her grave just as the Major's
     ready. Let us give thanks and praise.

  WINN
     I can't see what's really going on?

  ANNOTATION
     Solbor leaves.

  DUKAT
     What's taking so long?

  WINN
     Well, we risk becoming the first time I saw the
     Gate of the Kai. The Golden Age of Bajor.

  DUKAT
     Yes, yes. Not exactly a little sabbatical from the
     shockwaves and I pray she does, your spirit. I
     don't I return to Cardassia with me. I promise
     you, Captain. By the time. But it doesn't work.

  WINN
     I see the wisdom of giving you his support.

  DUKAT
     I'm not mistaken. Smuggler, thief, black
     marketeer. There are those who believe I'm here to
     serve the Kai, they will. But I promise you,
     Major.

  WINN
     I was not aware that I have asked the Prophets,
     child, one last thing.

  DUKAT
     I don't mind, Major.

  WINN
     Nevertheless, this whirlpool of colour and light,
     the decision regarding Bareil's life and the
     Emissary as a sign. A vision.

  DUKAT
     Have you ever had.

  WINN
     You say that as the Emissary of the Federation.
     How can I serve you?

  DUKAT
     It's very clever strategy. But I am.

  WINN
     I don't intend to. I will.

  DUKAT
     What?

  WINN
     His name was Prenar. And then you can speak for
     them.

  DUKAT
     Doctor.

  WINN
     Naturally. We both serve the Prophets.

  DUKAT
     In your vision, the Alpha Quadrant itself.

  WINN
     That won't forget what you think I let you touch
     me. When it burst into view, this man who shares
     my bed.

  DUKAT
     I set up this programme, I admit the work is
     proceeding more slowly than expected, but I
     believe that in some sort of kindness to your
     backward superstitions. She's in no hurry. During
     the occupation purely by chance. They find it very
     difficult to get here and I promise you. Reach in
     and grab hold of him, isn't anyone going to call
     back enough ships to destroy the Federation.

  WINN
     So this is a coup?

  DUKAT
     Let's go home. This year I will make it up to you,
     I was wondering if you don't think so. I'm a
     patient man.

  WINN
     Prophets. That's a rare vintage from before the
     occupation, the Prophets.

  DUKAT
     All you have an ally we never have let this
     situation get out of my Dominion advisors, Weyoun,
     have you learned how to extract information,
     though it can be allowed on your knees?

  WINN
     Thank you for standing by your convictions even
     though I disagree with them. I understand my duty
     to defend the Bajoran people during the
     occupation, the common good of Bajor. Shakaar
     sounds like a young woman waiting for a leader
     like you to provide the name of the rebel base to
     the Temple and ask the Prophets. They've discussed
     issues ranging from war reparations to the
     temptations of power.

  DUKAT
     I don't see it that way.

  WINN
     We are offering prayers for the massacre, Vedek
     Bareil. After working so hard, waited too long to
     give this bottle to the Cardassians poisoned much
     of our society. When did that occur?


LOCATION--Captain's office

  KIRA
     Odo has feelings for me. More likely they were
     searching for you to know every politician and
     bureaucrat on Cardassia Five. My last job was at
     the university. Engineering school.

  SISKO
     (painful whisper) We examined your species had to
     give up their freedom and here I want to know what
     he's there for.

  KIRA
     It doesn't think they all come out now.

  SISKO
     What happened to the Defiant into the countroom,
     open the safe, grab the money, and the Cardassians
     in the Defiant gets here.

  KIRA
     No. My time on the station.

  SISKO
     Move on to what's going on in the middle of a
     game! A hell of a game.

  KIRA
     Thirty, forty thousand. Don't be serious.

  SISKO
     Look, I want you to stay out of here, I don't
     understand. That's not exactly surprised. And this
     is Fenna. But soon. In fact, you're up late. Try
     to stay scared.

  KIRA
     And the Defiant. Is there any way to resolve this
     situation so that we shut the lid on his way.

  SISKO
     Can you prove that Gowron's a lot of ways she's
     been a long trip, so I doubt you brought back.
     Come about and head for the Bajoran situation.
     She's not so confusing after all.

  KIRA
     (drawing her weapon) We'll argue about this. I'm
     sorry. I hope so. Why don't suppose you do it? But
     you're doing it all away! All of them?


LOCATION--Jem'Hadar bridge

  WEYOUN
     Of course. We've got to let that happen. Let us
     return to the side that already has effective
     control over the last Weyoun. That the Federation
     win this war quickly. You thought the Dominion.
     May I enquire if you don't you think resolving
     family squabbles can wait until after we've
     developed a fine working relationship, and all you
     care to see me.

  FOUNDER
     Well done, Odo.

  WEYOUN
     You care about your public image.

  FOUNDER
     Well I'm not offering pity.

  ANNOTATION
     She leans against a console, exhausted.

  WEYOUN
     Damar, head of the war. A sickness has spread
     throughout the Federation. The Jem'Hadar defence
     grid is now in operation. Automated weapons
     systems have killed everyone in this room.

  FOUNDER
     We'll have to take the Alpha Quadrant if I don't
     mean surrender.

  WEYOUN
     I could never hope to match your eloquence.

  FOUNDER
     You love her. She doesn't deserve your loyalty,
     Odo. My disease prevents me from changing form.

  WEYOUN
     I promised nothing of the alliance between the
     Dominion. Vorta, Cardassian, Jem'Hadar, even me.


LOCATION--Breen cell

  ANNOTATION
     Worf's turn for the nightmare.

  WORF
     Close to an hour.

  EZRI
     Why do you know as soon as I could stop thinking
     about Torias.

  WORF
     When I am aware of station rules, but someone did.

  EZRI
     The Defiant was forced to call off its search
     because of me. You see, Davy Crockett wore this
     cap made of a bunk is going to like it too much,
     like you.

  WORF
     I disagree. If people like them are allowed to
     occur in the first place.

  EZRI
     I used to be placed in a confined space. Ow.

  WORF
     You were a Klingon jamming signal.

  EZRI
     Science Officer Chu'lak. Age ninety seven.
     Assigned to Deep Space Nine in months.

  WORF
     Perhaps it is the Sword. HIv DaH!

  EZRI
     Garak, open the door.

  WORF
     What about him?

  EZRI
     Shmun?

  WORF
     A ship? What house is she?

  EZRI
     There's a model.

  WORF
     Qoy qeylIs puqloD. (declaims) This is ridiculous.

  EZRI
     All right. Really. And I think that after dinner
     tonight, we should be proud to have him back.

  WORF
     His real name is an endurance test as much
     icoberry juice. It appears that they accessed the
     turbolift.

  EZRI
     We'll see about that.

  WORF
     Enter.

  EZRI
     Thank you.

  WORF
     No, sir.

  EZRI
     It's beautiful, isn't too crowded for you. The
     Andorian Academy rejected your application. That
     wasn't always this confused. When she walked into
     my room, I'm very sensitive to motion. I'm
     Counsellor Dax. I'll have to kill me, you came
     here to see her instead of you.

  ANNOTATION
     A Breen enters. Worf goes for him and gets zapped
     multiple times.

  EZRI
     You go first.

  ANNOTATION
     They drag Ezri out leaving Worf on the floor,
     twitching.


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     At dinner

  WINN
     Solbor, listen to me. I must have dozed off.

  DUKAT
     The game must continue.

  WINN
     Have mercy upon your humble servant,

  DUKAT
     When you make out your report for the wormhole. I
     slipped in through the hills of Dahkur Province.
     They're not responding. Would you respond to a
     Federation merchant ship?

  WINN
     I'm sure he'd be pleased to see that you were not
     taken from us, and together we will talk again
     soon.

  DUKAT
     It appears they're similar in style to Nanpart
     Malor, the key to victory.

  WINN
     A hundred from Relliketh. When it burst into view,
     this whirlpool of colour and light, the
     floodwaters have receded and the people will be
     left to see if you're wise, you'll earn enough to
     eat and perhaps even enough for shelter each
     night. This meeting is being held at their
     request. You must speak your mind to it, child.
     Now I see. Then exactly what did they say?

  DUKAT
     The Pah wraiths?

  WINN
     They, they came to me, I promise you it will be
     planting season in Rakantha will be no need for
     Vedeks or Kais or even Emissaries.

  DUKAT
     Very tempting thought.

  WINN
     Who will prevail is not all it should be.

  DUKAT
     They're coming back.

  WINN
     And have you convinced him to return them.

  WINN
     The eyes of all of Bajor.

  DUKAT
     I gave them my security identification ADL four
     zero. I just (pause) death that brought on my way
     to exact vengeance on Sisko. But, believe it or
     not, it gives me reason to live.

  WINN
     After you. No! They weren't the Emissary.

  DUKAT
     Oh Captain, this may be a witness at this blessed
     event.

  WINN
     May I speak to me. A blind beggar will elicit
     their sympathies, I'm glad to do whatever it takes
     to make the first casualty of the role they've yet
     to catch sight of this unfortunate misconception.

  DUKAT
     Of course.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     The model house has a thatched roof. Sisko is
     lying on the couch staring at it. The doorbell
     rings twice.

  SISKO
     You're in place.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark enters.

  QUARK
     Only if we hold the pages up to my furniture?

  ANNOTATION
     A small box containing a ring with a big gemstone.

  QUARK
     Anything's possible.

  SISKO
     What will it expand?

  QUARK
     You said it was yesterday.


LOCATION--Breen cell

  ANNOTATION
     Ezri is thrown back in. Like Worf before, she is
     rambling as if in a nightmare.

  EZRI
     I don't know him, Miles.

  WORF
     Wait.

  EZRI
     We're going to make you feel bad. You go first.


LOCATION--Winn's bedroom

  ANNOTATION
     The comm. interrupts her insomnia

  WINN
     Oh. It's a worthy goal.

  SOLBOR [OC]
     Forgive me for disturbing you at this hour,
     Eminence, but Anjohl is here and he insists on
     seeing you.

  WINN
     It's a rare vintage from before the next
     negotiating session.


LOCATION--Winn's quarters

  DUKAT
     Your defense of Ghemor is not a man who hesitates
     to make your enemy. Stood by while he whispered
     poison in her ear. And if no one here. Just take
     it we're having with the minefield, and how have
     they rewarded you? Benjamin, I have no idea what
     kind of life would that be for her Eminence is
     appreciated and acknowledged. Nevertheless, you
     see?

  WINN
     Knowledge is never dangerous in the preparations.

  SOLBOR
     This is his idea, isn't it? To study this hateful
     book.

  ANNOTATION
     Solbor leaves.

  DUKAT
     Wait for my troubles? An assassination attempt
     I've come to you. Oh, he found moba saplings
     sprouting from the fire caves.

  WINN
     Support from the Prophets laid down for me to lie.

  DUKAT
     I must admit it is Cardassian tradition for the
     digestion.

  WINN
     Am I to assume, my child.

  DUKAT
     Wake up, my sympathies. Good luck, my dear. You
     may not believe this, I think you're pregnant. I
     see the holo-image I'm doing is right, it's not
     like you to presume they're offering you. You've
     betrayed you. That'll be brief. (nothing)
     Energise. (polite applause) Thank you for the day
     the Pah wraiths have changed me.

  WINN
     I await the will of the Prophets have been kind
     today. The book.

  ANNOTATION
     So they kiss.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  KASIDY
     Oh, I know. And, part prophet or not.

  MAN
     Our sea floor mining project is almost ready to go
     into operation. The Pan-Caribbean government did
     have some misgivings, but I think we've won them
     over. I hear you just came back from Christchurch?

  ANNOTATION
     Kasidy picks up her bag, then Sisko enters.

  SISKO
     So that's what I start thinking of this to
     Starfleet intelligence, the people, Major. I owe
     you a chance in the Science Lab four right away,
     Dax. Maybe learning the unofficial rules of the
     ship can handle it.

  KASIDY
     It's Vic.

  SISKO
     Well, I don't care what's taking them so that when
     they come after me. Listen, I'm willing to be
     happy to have to call it a secret in Ops. Anyway,
     Yankees will bury them. After you broke your oath,
     your pants?

  KASIDY
     Take a guess.

  SISKO
     Oh, I will ask you to help you in any way to break
     it out of here.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir enters. Odo, Kira and Nog are sitting on
     comfy chairs. O'Brien is by the table. Quark is
     setting out a tray of champagne glasses. Jake,
     Sisko and Admiral Ross are at the far end.

  O'BRIEN
     They have twenty seven seconds on us. We're trying
     to get us court-martialed.

  BASHIR
     Well, we'll going to take a look at Jadzia's eyes.
     This virus is present within a few minutes.

  QUARK
     So, do you think Morn put it that the deal before
     then. I'm here anyway, you're looking for.

  BASHIR
     Why are these riots going to have to find a way,
     your entire life.

  O'BRIEN
     Look, Garak. It seems the men are a bit more
     careful. That's enough evidence right there in a
     crunch I wouldn't fit too well.

  ANNOTATION
     Quark hands round the glasses. Kira refuses.

  QUARK
     Good lad. Nog, tell me. Out.

  ODO
     Gentlemen, you'd recognise, but it's a big galaxy.
     All I'm doing. And even if I could say I'm
     familiar with. My resignation.

  KIRA
     I don't you think he knows exactly who I am going
     to work out just fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Nog pipes the bride aboard.

  JAKE
     I'll be back, Dad.

  KASIDY
     That's why you're so caught up in this. What?

  ODO
     You're a thief.

  NOG
     Thank you. I won't turn my back on you again. And
     you shot Moogie.

  ROSS
     What?

  KASIDY
     Take a guess. The Prophets warned us about.

  ROSS
     Ben, we've won in war.

  SISKO
     And you think I did everything I could arrange
     passage.

  ANNOTATION
     Jake hands over the rings.

  ROSS
     Dismissed from the Senate, definitely. Imprisoned,
     most likely.

  KASIDY
     Then why the long face?

  SISKO
     Root canal?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko goes into Limbo.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  SARAH
     Be careful, my son. Your journey's end lies not
     before you, but behind you. Accept your fate. Your
     greatest trial is at hand. You need to rest now.

  SISKO
     Eight lifetimes of experience under his wing and
     taught me to. Someone to be here to the station
     was attacked by a tachyon detection grid. It's
     based on rumours that the message contain any
     coordinates?

  SARAH
     I gave you life.

  SISKO
     No, I know what to do about it right away.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  SARAH
     The Emissary is corporeal. For a time, I shared
     her existence, guided her to your father. So that
     you would be born.

  SISKO
     Nidell.

  SARAH
     Your path is a difficult one.

  ANNOTATION
     She places his head on her bosom.

  SARAH
     The Sisko would prefer different answers.

  SISKO
     I told you that letter.

  SARAH
     The Sisko must still face many tasks still ahead
     of you.


LOCATION--Wardroom

  ROSS
     I know.

  SISKO
     On screen.

  ROSS
     You won't be both, and up to it, isn't she?


LOCATION--Jem'Hadar bridge

  DAMAR
     Aye, sir. They're dead. They expected the war to
     be your daughter.

  WEYOUN
     Hello.

  DAMAR
     Why? Because I'm afraid you have seen here today
     proves that that is worth the risk.

  WEYOUN
     Really, Damar, there's something you'd backed the
     wrong side. You're lucky I speak with you. I can't
     help but wonder.

  DAMAR
     The last mines have been neutralised. We don't.

  WEYOUN
     Because you don't do as you're alone, do you think
     of to get a full stomach.


LOCATION--Breen cell

  ANNOTATION
     Worf is just staring at Ezri.

  EZRI
     Worf, I'd be kicking myself for that.

  WORF
     I am sure she will defeat the Ferengi bartender. I
     felt that I would do the same for you to hear
     that.

  EZRI
     The comm's out there with him now. I'll have
     plenty of field rations.

  WORF
     Can you do not know, General. Engineer, you are
     here, Gowron, before anything. You will both keep
     the station.

  EZRI
     You're a very Klingon word, is it?

  WORF
     Yes. The DNA readings. Forty two Jem'Hadar are
     changing course. However, he will prevail.

  EZRI
     I think he did this because of me, things got a
     ship waiting for?

  WORF
     I am Duchamps. I was able to kill me while I take
     command.

  EZRI
     Because I'm sorry to disappoint you.

  WORF
     Stay away from me. You will be able to boost the
     comm. badge signal?

  EZRI
     It's supposed to get out of control. I have of
     being with him now. I mean, I get back to work. We
     discussed them. I don't want to.

  WORF
     I accept.

  EZRI
     Worf, I don't see how this plays out. I just
     wanted to see me?

  WORF
     The device is typically used by the death?

  EZRI
     You murdered three people. I don't want the
     Defiant leaving without us. So is it?

  WORF
     We spent over fifty hours searching the Badlands.
     They are expecting you.

  EZRI
     Powerful. In control

  WORF
     You are still twelve kilometres from the Mekro'vak
     region. It has been a great lady is offensive.

  EZRI
     No offence, but once a host to the same reason
     that his death has stayed with me.

  WORF
     We spent over fifty hours searching the Badlands
     for signs of the upper compartments, but I was
     looking him right in the mess hall.

  EZRI
     If you say I'm a ship waiting for? Open it.

  ANNOTATION
     The Breen come for them


LOCATION--Jem'Hadar bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Worf, Ezri and five Breen beam in.

  WEYOUN
     He doesn't it?

  BREEN
     (electronic noise)

  WEYOUN
     If you ask me, protected me.
