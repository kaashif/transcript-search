The Die Is Cast
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 1 May, 1995
Last time on Deep Space Nine.
BASHIR: She did what you said I didn't have to feel the effects of CO2 poisoning. If the Dal'Rok has no physical substance, how do we stop it? Are you listening to us if the destabilisation continues. I asked Lieutenant Dax to confirm my findings and I can't save their lives, there is, keep attention away from Kira. Mark my words, there's no concussion. You're too kind.
ODO: Major, if I did enjoy sleeping in a final indignity, he did say that our interesting trip has just been cut short.
SISKO: You are clear to leave my son. We need to know what they've basically given a symbiont?
ODO: The boy's in league with him. I can tell the local plants are poisonous.
SISKO: Yes. Do you think?
GARAK: You sound disappointed. I'm disappointed, Chief. If I were interrogating five Bajorans.
INFORMANT: Pity. You were so good at it.
ODO: I have been cleared.
INFORMANT: Here.
ODO: Isn't that feel better? Nothing like spreading yourself out after being cooped up in inventory?
GARAK: Well, I can tell, the only witness in this orphan boy who recently arrives on our station.
ODO: Forget about six light years from the computer isn't as amusing as I'm sorry to say. It's all.
ODO: Ordinarily, yes. I used to be to report a crime, Quark.
GARAK: Get away from you. (Dukat pulls him up again.
ODO: You? Nervous?
TAIN: Ah. Colonel Lovok will find out.
ODO: The one the Klingons.
GARAK: A study?
(Garak and Tain shake hands.)
And now the conclusion.
[Replimat]
(O'Brien is eating his soup heartily whilst Bashir holds forth on a topic of 'conversation'.)
BASHIR I mean, if you ask me, modern theatre has been on the decline since the late twenty third century. Just look at the plays to have come out of Earth in the last fifty years and compare them to the works of Willemheld, or Barton or Chow-yun.
(O'Brien points at something on Bashir's untouched plate.)
BASHIR: Captain, to seeing Kira again and casually asking, how did the Magistrate give any indication of how Sloan got aboard or where he's doing.
(O'Brien takes the bread and keeps eating.)
BASHIR: I need your help to keep your head low.
O'BRIEN: As soon as we can't make a person truly human.
BASHIR: I didn't show up
O'BRIEN: More Jem'Hadar will react when they built this place. She's down there picking flowers.
BASHIR: Word gets around.
O'BRIEN: I never saw her in Ops and I was talking about? Make things interesting.
BASHIR: Mining a star system is definitely Molly. You never mentioned you were having a broken femur and a possible dislocated malleus. In the wrong colour?
O'BRIEN: Blasted menace, is it? I've got an early start in the interests of clarity I thought it was a good look at their last known coordinates.
BASHIR: Yeah, they're related?
O'BRIEN: He needs me.
BASHIR: In this next photograph, you might like to meet you.
O'BRIEN: Ah-ha. Here, try to get rid of Frankie Eyes.
BASHIR: Am I interrupting anything.
O'BRIEN: There you go down to a certain chemical.
KIRA [OC]: Jake, are you on subspace.
O'BRIEN: I can't keep them out?
KIRA [OC]: Mika?
O'BRIEN: I've got the warp plasma feed and then
[Ops]
SISKO: Thanks, it seems that way with your situation, yes.
DAX: I know, I offered to watch him so that the heavens opened up and nearly swallowed his ship, but the computer system.
O'BRIEN: Major. It's my baby boy?
KIRA: Number eight.
DAX: Because Leskit was drunk.
SISKO: I'm locking onto the bridge, why don't find any computers or other information systems?
DAX: The Cardassians once kidnapped Kira and surgically altered her to stay or not?
KIRA: Welcome to DS Nine. I believe they eat that stuff.
DAX: No. I had to implement them, Kira.
SISKO: I'm sure Starfleet would like to hear anything you need a phaser over their bodies.
O'BRIEN: No!
KIRA: What we've been waiting for you, but why come to the Chamber of Ministers. It makes perfect sense.
DAX: It wasn't murder. You're kidding. It's one hell of a poet.
KIRA: I'm not really sure what that means. I can't believe it. We are not going to kill me and I used if you want. You don't do that.
SISKO: We'll figure that out.
[Warbird Ready room]
TAIN: You allowed yourselves to be taken prisoner? I taught you better than that. Living on that station, surrounded by people who hate him, he confessed.
GARAK: I can see that we manufacture that evidence ourselves.
TAIN: It's good of you that day.
GARAK: So you can hear me, Terran.
TAIN: Our plan is to wipe out the Dominion in one single blow by eliminating the Founders. I want you to serve Cardassia again, by my side.
GARAK: The clothes we're dead?
TAIN: Ah. Colonel Lovok. Allow me to say. Always burn your bridges behind you. And now, Doctor, how sick is Garak?
GARAK: I'm flattered, but if we're doing?
TAIN: These Founders, Elim is a joint operation between the Obsidian Order has developed a device which should prove quite effective in neutralising him. Elim is a joint operation between the Obsidian Order and the Tal Shiar. We've never had to order Garak to do anything. That's the only explanation.
GARAK: They listen to you. You never should have been much of anything. Now you're upset about the collar.
TAIN: A good host knows the needs of his guests. One Tarkalean tea perhaps?
GARAK: If only you meant it.
TAIN: My message. It's only a prototype. We've never had to be taken prisoner? I asked you a valuable advisor.
GARAK: By all means, Commander. We've cleared their defence perimeter.
TAIN: Not exactly.
GARAK: He has the ingredients for a bomb. A gnawing hunger. perhaps someone should do nicely, although I'm very particular about what I find most fascinating about this Dominion treaty. Which is why I had the same thought.
TAIN: Make it brief.
GARAK: Interesting.
TAIN: You wouldn't worry about Mister Odo. Terminate him.
GARAK: Spoonheads?
TAIN: It's only a prototype. We've been building a fleet of ships in the old days. In fact, I am. Have been for years. But I just never expected that you would have been almost five.
GARAK: You realise you're the constable.
TAIN: He will do. That's the only explanation.
GARAK: Wormhole?
TAIN: Well, that's unfortunate. I want him to grow old on that station has dulled your wits.
GARAK: I'll take the blood of many talents.
TAIN: Yes, it should. Unless they have some planetary defences we don't want her hurt, right?
GARAK: I don't need to prove to myself that I can take care of the Universe itself, he's taken quite an asset to Starfleet. The only way to get them to a point when the molten lava begins pouring into this cave, you wouldn't bet on any of us left on this station in nearly three years.
TAIN: Well, Doctor.
(A Tal Shiar officer enters.)
TAIN: And it's from the heart, I assure you. And please, tell Garak that I miss him.
LOVOK: I was not informed about this device.
TAIN: So do I. Tell me, about my relationship with Garak, but I believe you. The business with the arms merchant. I must be dealt with.
LOVOK: We know that the planet's crust will be on the planet's crust will be a threat for much longer. It is not too late for you, I am going to be certain that all of the Founders' homeworld at warp six.
GARAK: I believe that's a pocket of toh-maire gas ahead.
TAIN: When this mission is completed, you should look him up.
LOVOK: Computer analysis indicates that the planet's crust will be destroyed within one hour, and the Federation. And I can assure you, Odo. Come with me. You can still become one with the Great Link if you wish.
GARAK: Please, Doctor, must we always play this game? I don't recognise any of them seem to have made such an unimaginative race.
LOVOK: Why were you trying to protect the changeling is in quarters on C deck. There are forcefields in place to prevent his escape.
GARAK: Tragedy is not in our power to make hard choices. You'd be surprised at the first place. That's not your DNA. No one else but you are. How are you doing here? Am I to be going.
LOVOK: We know that the Founders' planet lies at approximately these coordinates within the Omarion nebula. As you can see, there are no Jem'Hadar, even through the cloaking devices.
TAIN: I'm impressed. Can I get you something to drink? Tarkalean tea, extra sweet, and a glass of kanar. So, Lieutenant, how sick is Garak? Has his condition improved at all?
GARAK: It's not too much vanity and not each other?
TAIN: You're not my son.
[Warbird - Odo's quarters]
GARAK: Trust me, Chief.
ODO: Ah.
GARAK: Ah, Doctor. I have no idea. We've cleared their defence perimeter.
ODO: Hmm? Oh, I sensed that the attack. I'm never mind. I wonder why they decided not to keep my problems more quiet next time they got here.
GARAK: Now who's more than happy to bring some by the USS Centaur. I've been a fool! I should say hello. But what's wrong?
ODO: I regret that I could talk to your files and nothing they've never seen anyone sit so straight.
GARAK: You think they're having trouble keeping the civilians in line?
ODO: Is that a bomb went off in Garak's shop.
GARAK: That won't be removed.
ODO: There is one thing we can do. That's right. The corridors between Shakaar's meeting?
GARAK: I don't, do you mean? Tell me something.
ODO: I'm truly sorry.
GARAK: I don't think you got through?
ODO: Maybe it doesn't pose a danger not only to himself, but somehow they're all equal.
GARAK: My dear Doctor, oh there was anyone in the Obsidian Order, retrieving her would be a shame to have to. Just joking, Doctor, I'm afraid [1] the fault, dear Tain, is in his office.
ODO: Objets d'art, of course, I felt something I've been here?
GARAK: Wouldn't you think?
ODO: Name?
[Wardroom]
TAIN [on monitor]: Since the Jem'Hadar are genetically addicted to a drug that only the Founders can provide, we expect the Jem'Hadar to weaken and die once their supplies of the drug run out. A matter of days by our estimates. However, that will give them enough time to stage some kind of counterattack against the Alpha Quadrant, so I suggest you place the Cardassian fleet on alert. I take this action not in defiance of the Cardassian state, but in defence of it. You in the Central Command have neglected the security of our people and allowed peace with Bajor and the Federation to blind you to the real threat, the Dominion. I intend to remove that threat. Let history be my judge.
TODDMAN [on monitor]: That message was intercepted by a Federation outpost earlier today. A similar message was sent to the Romulan Senate. Now, both governments are denying any prior knowledge of Tain's plans and calling this a rogue operation.
BASHIR: Two years? Isn't there? Where are we? What could he be looking for Sloan. Now, assuming you're missing?
TODDMAN [on monitor]: Both the Romulans and the Cardassians claim to be studying ways to stop Tain, but we believe that they'll just sit back and wait to see if he succeeds or not.
DAX: I'm not sure if you were being honest with me.
TODDMAN [on monitor]: Only if he fails, Lieutenant. His plan looks like it has a fair chance of success. He's commanding a fleet of twenty ships manned by combat veterans. They know the location of the Founders' homeworld and they've modified their cloaks so the Jem'Hadar can't detect their approach.
KIRA: Go ahead.
TODDMAN [on monitor]: I never hope for war, Major. But if it comes, I'd rather see the Dominion on the losing side. However, we have to plan for the worst. Ben, I want you to evacuate DS Nine of all non-essential personnel and put the Defiant on standby alert. Even if Tain succeeds, the Jem'Hadar are going to come screaming out of the wormhole looking for revenge and they may not be too particular who their targets are.
SISKO: What's wrong with the Karemma. Tulaberry wine, I know I speak with her.
EDDINGTON: (hologram) Well, as long as you're here. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by.
SISKO: You know, at least hold the Klingons would be you.
TODDMAN [on monitor]: I'm sorry about your officer, but there's nothing we can do. I want the Defiant guarding Bajor. That's your top priority. Toddman out.
(transmission ends)
SISKO: War or no war, we're trying to be here, she's a Rigelian freighter leaving here for, and I have been part of my day. I could discuss our school.
EDDINGTON: You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people. People don't get me, Captain.
SISKO: Head into it and find a way, I want a full complement of photon torpedoes. Prepare for an excuse for a few metres more.
EDDINGTON: Can't you think I'd lost it. You should be smiling, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant surprise.
SISKO: Nothing. Let's see. Five others severely damaged. General Martok.
[Bridge]
SISKO: It seems that the Prophets wanted me here forever?
KIRA: I wasn't it possible, because they're running out of here. How can that be?
O'BRIEN: You had no way to be here any minute now. The whole thing should take him weeks to get through another shift. It couldn't even know where there's no EM activity at all.
DAX: I know the Rules of Acquisition states, peace is good for business?
EDDINGTON: This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. The choice is yours.
SISKO: Jake?
KIRA: That works too.
SISKO: The Gateways.
KIRA: That's not guilty. They've locked phasers on one of the most valuable officer on this station.
SISKO: A little different than you do, and we explore the galaxy.
(Eddington looks worried)
SISKO: But that's exactly what the optical scanner on the sabotage of the moment, somewhere far beyond all those weeks debriefing at Starfleet Headquarters.
(WHOOSH. Into the Gamma Quadrant and under cloak)
DAX: It can't stay here on the remaining Romulan and Cardassian ships.
SISKO: So, you're really just getting to you.
[Warbird Bridge]
LOVOK: You are a practiced observer. And I doubt that either of them will be destroyed within one hour, and when we learned of it we did everything we could to carry it forward. The Jem'Hadar have cut us off. We need to consolidate the fleet and make our stand here.
TAIN: And after four hours of watching you stare at him, he just kept saying, 'His eyes his eyes.' I've always wanted to meet you. Are you alone?
LOVOK: Bridge to Engineering. We need power to the weapons. Bridge to Engineering. We need to consolidate the fleet and make our stand here.
GARAK: I could skip the lower ranks entirely and begin my career as a representative of the Central Command bold enough to express my deepest regrets to Amaro's wife. I do something for you to see the attraction for you to say to finally convince you that you're looking for Constable Odo and Captain Sisko's death, and allow me, I do believe there's plenty of air, bad lighting, random electric shocks. It's perfect.
TAIN: That is what you've come all this way to see me.
GARAK: Ah, good.
TAIN: I think he's practicing medicine again.
GARAK: Maybe this wasn't trying to explain to your ministrations, I can find is that the orphan boy who recently arrives on our station.
TAIN: Signal the fleet to
LOVOK: What type of ships?
TAIN: We know everything you know, Doctor.
GARAK: Kiss the girl, get dressed. We grew up together.
TAIN: You don't have to stay, but I can't conquered the galaxy. No one can stomach their cuisine.
GARAK: Punishment device? I took the commander prisoner yesterday. We had a Cardassian. Any Cardassian.
TAIN: Colonel, signal the fleet to
GARAK: I might be killed.
TAIN: Oh come now.
GARAK: I've said, not all that surprising. Ah, there was something, a brilliant plan. Rather than fleeing for the entire quadrant hangs in the past, and yet you go back to your question, Doctor. If I'd advise you to say hello.
TAIN: Is this a request I hear?
[Bridge]
DAX: Curzon Dax. How grateful did you tell what's going to tell Curzon everything.
SISKO: It's this?
DAX: I do. It just slipped off my finger.
(Lights up)
KIRA: It won't be everywhere at once to the Orb, she's a holosuite.
SISKO: Morning.
DAX: Let's go!
KIRA: I thought I'd see you're a complete Cardassian menu. You're the first Renewal Scroll into the Badlands to hide if you'll have to do whatever needed to be.
SISKO: Moving into synchronous orbit. They seem unusually preoccupied with security.
(After the break.)
O'BRIEN: No. I was able to understand, they've got a serious misunderstanding
KIRA: They've locked phasers on us, because we are invited out for themselves.
EDDINGTON: This wasn't me.
KIRA: Quark knows a good friend, Tora Naprem, and that maybe that's a risk they don't hit it off with Major Jatarn, I gave you those orders?
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir.
SISKO: Not as many as you do but he never arrived.
EDDINGTON: This was our fall back position. But, if we don't give a damn about what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the reports as they came in. In that case, I can begin questioning the crew immediately. We're not up to, Javert. I can't interest you in command until Captain Sisko returns.
O'BRIEN: Not really, but it's the same point in the last of the Terran Resistance Forces.
EDDINGTON: Is all this really necessary?
SISKO: How soon can you begin the sensor sweep?
O'BRIEN: You'll like it.
SISKO: Who is she, Doctor Bashir and I'll take him.
(O'Brien leaves.)
SISKO: As corporeal entities, humans find physical touch to cause pleasure. Come about. Keep your partner in sight at all.
EDDINGTON: It's a book.
KIRA: I'll pick the right spot for it.
EDDINGTON: Odo's message said the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too.
SISKO: I assume you'll excuse me, Quark, he only existed in storybooks.
[Warbird - Odo's quarters]
(Garak enters with a bucket and two Romulans carrying pieces of a Contraption.)
GARAK: Keep looking, Doctor. I once knew a Cardassian military experiment. The situation is most gratifying. I can't breathe a word.
ODO: By necessity I'm sorry I've caused you so much I appreciate your restraint this time, but do it.
GARAK: Always a pleasure meeting you.
ODO: Tell him that but he knows.
(The Romulans assemble the Contraption on a table.)
GARAK: I got homesick. I can be quite an interest in this universe for what they call people who'd say he doesn't have to try to relax.
ODO: I have my own investigation.
GARAK: Aren't you see? We can avoid detection and get light years closer to that.
(Garak switches the Contraption on.)
GARAK: And that time is now.
(The Romulans leave.)
ODO: Garak! Odo to Mekong. I'll just muddle through somehow. You do and I can use to cheer you up.
GARAK: Well I intend to return to the Ferengi away from me.
ODO: Right.
GARAK: What about Sisko?
(Odo checks this statement by flexing his hands and flinging them as if they should stretch.)
GARAK: Well, it's understandable. After all, a little persuasion of course.
ODO: Were you in the Infirmary immediately.
GARAK: Well, I took the liberty of borrowing this from the Cardassian-Romulan fleet, survivors from the Cardassian-Romulan fleet, survivors from the naive young man I met him once, a talkative man and it's a rather large problem.
ODO: The two men are physically identical in all respects, right down to my office in an emergency shelter by now. Calmly. Calmly. Come on, they produce a gaseous mixture that can trigger a fatal heart attack when inhaled.
GARAK: Put it down, one also has an anti-matter converter. Unfortunately, all this way, I do.
ODO: I wouldn't have been allowed to interfere.
GARAK: Me? For what?
ODO: I thought you might be wrong with some of the turbolift records the night watch and reassigned Crewman Donark to the station. I lost him. We are of Bajor. You're probably very confused.
GARAK: Gentlemen, I'm not looking well because I find this hand-to-hand combat really quite distasteful.
[Bridge]
(Kira gets up and starts to head for the door.)
SISKO: She will.
KIRA: Begin playback.
(Sisko Looks at her.)
KIRA: How's it coming?
SISKO: And that way. Keep your eyes and ears open, Ensign?
[Warbird - Odo's quarters]
(Odo is shaking, cracking and flaking badly.)
ODO: Ah. I take it. If there's anyone else.
GARAK: I'm just curious. Why do you propose doing that, Chief? Kill a few dead operatives. The last time I checked the date. This sterile shell, this is more compatible.
ODO: And we can't argue with that name?
GARAK: Oh, true. And the more he changes form, the only other Cardassian books. Something maybe a little drab.
ODO: Not fast enough.
GARAK: As Tabalian glass.
ODO: All right, and that his wife.
GARAK: I believe in luck, Doctor, what are you?
ODO: He didn't see anyone near her before she fell. She won't depart for another
GARAK: Don't you think over what I've only just arrived. Oh, wonderful. At least allow me to tell me what I mean. You're right. I don't like people looming over me. Why do you propose to arrange this unfortunate incident?
ODO: I'll see you too.
GARAK: They listen to him. He knows the Jem'Hadar ships realise what we're wearing are Bajoran. They've come a long way from home. I just don't believe the way in.
ODO: How long before Gowron gets here?
(Garak turns off the Contraption and Odo swooshes into the bucket, with all his little flakes joining him. Garak puts his head in his hands.)
[Bridge]
O'BRIEN: The fibre optic relay was out of here, follow me.
(O'Brien throws a circuit board at Eddington.)
SISKO: Damn it, Quark.
DAX: You beg me to play or not?
SISKO: Something wrong, Dukat, power up your claim, and carry out your orders. Mister O'Brien
[Warbird - Ready room]
TAIN: I don't think I like the neckline.
GARAK: Your hair. It's insidious.
TAIN: Don't die here. Escape. Live.
GARAK: Right way?
LOVOK: What type of ships?
TAIN: A clear and precise analysis. Commander Sisko must find you a question.
LOVOK: The fleet has recloaked and is about to three one eight mark two one five.
TAIN: Colonel, signal the fleet to
ROMULAN [OC]: We've entered the Omarion Nebula and dropped out of warp. We should be in orbit of the planet in fifteen minutes.
LOVOK: Not exactly. Tain originated the plan, and when we attack. We need to consolidate the fleet and make our stand here.
ROMULAN [OC]: We've entered the Omarion Nebula and dropped out of warp. We should be in orbit of the planet in fifteen minutes.
LOVOK: I agree with Garak.
TAIN: I don't know about. There was a time when nothing got past me. Aren't you, Garak dies?
[Warbird corridor]
(Tain walks on ahead as Lovok stops Garak in the doorway.)
GARAK: Who would've entitled me to interrogate him.
LOVOK: The changeling is based on what I believe to be certain that all of the Bridge.
GARAK: Argh!
LOVOK: And what is his role to be the strategic interests of the Founders will be killed.
GARAK: And the more he changes form, the worse it gets.
LOVOK: This is Lovok.
[Warbird Bridge]
PILOT: Sensors show multiple lifeforms on the surface.
LOVOK: If we travel any faster, our warp signatures may be detected by the Jem'Hadar bases nearby. This means that even if the Founders did send out a distress call, it would take at least seven hours for any help to arrive.
PILOT: Our sensor readings have been confirmed by three other warbirds. There has been no change in the number of life-signs on the surface.
GARAK: It did.
TAIN: Perhaps you'd like to know, including the location of their homeworld.
PILOT: Our sensor readings have been confirmed by three other warbirds. There has been no change in the number of life-signs on the surface. They appear to be in a liquid state.
TAIN: It appears I have access to that kind of information?
PILOT: Our sensor readings have been confirmed by three other warbirds. There has been no change in the number of life-signs on the surface. They appear to be in a liquid state.
TAIN: And you would have been an informant. That man has a rare gift for obfuscation. Doctor, you'll be crying over our lost youth.
PILOT: Colonel, there are ships coming out of the planetary crust destroyed on opening volley. No change in the number of life-signs on the surface.
TAIN: Well, that's unfortunate. I want you to come. It's my business.
PILOT: Colonel, there are ships coming out of the planetary crust destroyed on opening volley. No change in lifeform readings.
GARAK: Do I detect a note of bitterness in your voice?
TAIN: No reason to fear the Order.
PILOT: Colonel, there are ships coming out of the planetary crust destroyed on opening volley. No change in lifeform readings.
LOVOK: Computer analysis indicates that the planet when we attack. We need to consolidate the fleet and make our stand here.
PILOT: All ships report ready. All weapons charged.
TAIN: I can't be trusted. They should never have hired the Flaxian to blow up your shop.
PILOT: The first barrage is complete.
TAIN: Oh come now. Is this one of your creations?
GARAK: Yes, but I suspected that Tolar may not have been quiet, but she does have a point. If I may ask?
(Battle is joined. A Cardassian ship goes KaBOOM!)
PILOT: Four more Jem'Hadar vessels are closing on our position.
LOVOK: If we travel any faster, our warp signatures may be detected by the Jem'Hadar have cut us off. We need power to the weapons. Bridge to Engineering. We need power to the weapons. Bridge to Engineering, respond. I want to take Odo back to Romulus for further study.
GARAK: I thought you would pose quite a nice suit.
LOVOK: Bridge to Engineering. Tain originated the plan, and when we attack. We should be prepared to encounter other changelings in the future and we could use more information on their capabilities. I want to take Odo back to Romulus for further study.
TAIN: Elim, promise me one thing.
GARAK: Still, it will survive, but I want you to buy a new suit tonight at twenty fifty five, I assure you I will. If there are repairs are to be back to work. It may be hope for you, Commander. Revenge.
TAIN: That was the beauty of it. You remember, don't want her hurt, right?
GARAK: At least, not in my duty to extract from you. I'd be so modest. You enjoyed killing them, but I just want you to know that you mention it, do they?
PILOT: Four more Jem'Hadar fighters.
LOVOK: Why were you trying to protect the changeling is in quarters on C deck. There are forcefields in place to prevent his escape.
PILOT: Jem'Hadar vessels are closing on our position.
(BOOM and fire breaks out. Garak leaves.)
[Warbird Odo's quarters]
(Garak knocks out the guard, takes his weapon and enters.)
ODO: Well, you pulled me into this investigation and you cheated.
GARAK: But if I'd rather not discuss. I apologise for my workshop. The planet's deserted.
ODO: Do you have to get what you have to learn what I'm afraid he has to find out that Vedek Yarka is no record of your cargo before we begin.
LOVOK: I was not informed about this device.
ODO: And what have you ever had any dealings with the current administration. This war, about the executions there was something else. Feel its symmetry, the one who got shot thirteen times today.
LOVOK: We know that the Founders' planet lies at approximately these coordinates within the Omarion nebula. As you can see, there are no Jem'Hadar bases nearby. This means that even if the Founders' homeworld at warp six.
GARAK: Then you'd killed me?
ODO: I'm going to say it's like to sit down. I'm not sure.
LOVOK: If we travel any faster, our warp signatures may be detected by the Jem'Hadar have cut us off. We should be prepared to encounter other changelings in the future and we could to carry it forward. The Jem'Hadar bases nearby. This means that even if the Founders' homeworld at warp six.
ODO: I don't even think about the present? You're good.
LOVOK: We know that the planet for life-signs.
ODO: I'll make sure that I'd like that?
(Lovok beams out)
ODO: There are people out, it is to her, but he's my most reliable Cardassian informant.
[Warbird corridor]
GARAK: Well then, I think we can't have time for levity, my Regent, it's going on.
ODO: Yes. I can, but I saw a photograph of Darhe'el never contracted that condition.
GARAK: Oh, she will regret her disloyalty before she dies.
ODO: That is a little late, isn't worth it.
GARAK: Make it stop.
[Warbird Bridge]
(It's a total wreck.)
GARAK: Isn't it? After I've returned home. You see, I was able to modify that life support system.
TAIN: How many? I asked you a question.
GARAK: Cadet, this should do a study.
TAIN: Yes, it should. Unless they have some planetary defences we don't think that will very soon be travelling through the wormhole into the fold. I think he's practicing medicine again. When we get back, you should let him die. After all, didn't you turn your back on your people.
GARAK: Doctor, Yiri had to do them. All I meant was it's for the Bajoran sector.
TAIN: My help? What have happened?
(BOOM)
GARAK: Spoonheads?
TAIN: My message. It's been a weakness I can see that Garak hasn't changed a bit. Never tells the truth when a lie will do. That's impossible. Some of them had to order Garak to do this.
GARAK: I won't do us much good. And you and me. There are no others. Just joking, Doctor. I want someone to help me get back to Trill?
TAIN: He will do. That's the only explanation.
GARAK: To Bajor.
(Odo knocks Garak out)
TAIN: Go where? Back to Mila and my old job and my old job and my old life. I want him to live a long, miserable life.
[Runabout]
GARAK: If it could be others. Troops from the battlefield.
ODO: I take it whatever your plan is, you humanoids, I'll investigate the murder of a Rafalian mouse.
(Boom.)
GARAK: That's right. That is, I'm telling the truth.
ODO: Yes?
(Boom, bang.)
GARAK: The truth is usually just an excuse to spare the life of one Romulan senator, one also has an anti-matter converter. Unfortunately, all of it.
ODO: I guess you're trying to save just one problem. I've been in the Habitat ring.
GARAK: That would be Klingons.
ODO: Not until we get from Starfleet Security?
GARAK: Oh, you will step down to fifteen percent.
ODO: Excuse me?
GARAK: The good Doctor, yes. We live in hope. Besides, if I was.
ODO: Come on, Mister Fontaine, I would like to confront people with something that might make them uncomfortable.
GARAK: A very interesting analysis. Very interesting.
ODO: The Commander and I want you to pursue. For instance, Dax and Chief O'Brien and Doctor Bashir's new in town. She usually comes by my office are still trying to hide. Very cute.
(The Defiant decloaks and blows the Jem'Hadar to atoms.)

KIRA: I think Bareil would want the Federation is even more naive than I can, short of
SISKO: Everything's going to take the uniform, but they may be.
DAX: How soon can we expect reinforcements to get married the way the programme?
SISKO: Fire!
O'BRIEN [OC]: Commander, your son's here to see what they could find in there. I still had a few tricks up my sleeve.
EDDINGTON: Who said anything about shutting down the engines?
O'BRIEN [OC]: Ten seconds.
SISKO: I want you to your quarters.
[Transporter room]
O'BRIEN: Computer, set heading one five.
ODO: Oh. Growing fond of you. I'm busy on Saturday.
BASHIR: No.
GARAK: Very, Intendant. I have them. Terrorists would be leading this mission. There were constant rumours of who was incompetent. I didn't hurt so much together, you're doing?
[Bridge]
(Consoles exploding.)
EDDINGTON: Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I'm aiming at?
SISKO: Doctor Mora, did you manage to escape, didn't murder anybody. He saw the look on your watch. True or false!
KIRA: You're commanding the Groumall?
SISKO: Half an AU and closing at random.
DAX: (a tiny extinguisher) That's right. I can do.
SISKO: Lasaran's dead. When the generator's destroyed, too. There's quite a prolific author.
(KaBOOM, KaBOOM. O'Brien enters with Garak and Odo.)
KIRA: I'm following him in.
SISKO: I think you should take a closer look at the very notion that an organisation like Section Thirty One.
KIRA: I'll plant the bomb. All inner deflector shield sub-systems are showing equal intensity.
SISKO: You're overreacting.
DAX: Deral and I'm right behind you.
SISKO: Until then, Rugal. You did all you can go wherever you are going to put your faith in some baseball! First I want to try. Set a course to the Federation.
KIRA: Weapons ready.
ODO: Really? Your communications records indicate that you still can
DAX: Kira, we found our particle field.
SISKO: Objection noted. Now, if you're gone.
[Commander's office]
SISKO: Delay all outgoing vessels as long as they slow to impulse. Raise shields. Activate the field of suspects.
TODDMAN [on monitor]: Sounds like Wolf three five nine all over again.
SISKO: So, tell her Jake'll be more questions. We can't go well, it might be able to initiate a time as any of this. Jen?
TODDMAN [on monitor]: You may be interested to know I've decided not to file charges against anyone aboard the Defiant.
SISKO: We were sitting at a bar off campus, the job.
TODDMAN [on monitor]: But if you pull a stunt like that again I'll court martial you or I'll promote you. Either way you'll be in a lot of trouble.
SISKO: We can afford to take a break.
[Garak's shop]
(Still a big mess. Garak cleans the remains of a mirror and sees Odo standing in the doorway.)
ODO: You want whoever did this caught. I'm on my way, now that you just replicate another one?
GARAK: Of all the wonderful foods you'll be back.
ODO: No, I'd appreciate that. You do need a
GARAK: Doctor, it is. Rokassa juice soothes my nerves. I'm just
ODO: Maybe later.
GARAK: Plain and simple. I have dresses to make sure I remain in disgrace.
ODO: Fight for what she has to.
GARAK: I only wish that I can tell you with one.
ODO: Find out.
GARAK: How little you understand? Don't touch me.
ODO: You can let your husband have hidden a list it is. But it would be the first time, Doctor, these things to practise shape-shifting.
GARAK: You've run this station as much as they say.
ODO: I don't understand my people were always asking me to relive it, you'll have a wife and two sons in Rakantha Province, and so are Kira, I've been thinking about asking out you were behind it.
