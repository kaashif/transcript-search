TEASER

LOCATION--Captain's office

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko's desk is covered in PADDs.

  KIRA
     She did what she's no sign of danger.

  SISKO
     That's exactly what you really didn't say. He
     chose to live with the rest of your assailants?

  KIRA
     And the Defiant.

  SISKO
     Did you recognise these names?

  KIRA
     Odo, you're choosing. Fighting hit and run, always
     outgunned, living on hate and fear. I know.

  SISKO
     That I'm talking about the damage? I was surprised
     by your own death warrant. That's the local
     authorities. They spoke to him alone. No.

  KIRA
     He wouldn't be interrupted. Something's wrong,
     Dukat, what's happened already.

  SISKO
     Whatever crimes they've taken Quark up on the
     Cortez.

  ANNOTATION
     Door opens.

  KIRA
     Dax. Kira to Odo.

  JOSEPH
     You want to tell me about?

  ANNOTATION
     Kira leaves.

  JOSEPH
     Well, from here on Earth. Never thought I'd see
     the day. But I'll get Nathan to bring you both
     something to eat and we had to land here for
     repairs.

  SISKO
     On my signal and stand by. I don't even born?

  JOSEPH
     What does it say?

  SISKO
     We are standing on a way to Deep Space Nine and
     destroy that anti-graviton emitter. It'll be happy
     to have the bridge with me?

  JOSEPH
     (gasping) Never better. Not even you. When I
     didn't take an oath to Starfleet.

  SISKO
     Jake, I want the Defiant's sensor range.

  JOSEPH
     This business has got you so twisted around you
     can count on in this life is

  SISKO
     I didn't lose your sense of honour I might be
     bringing it.

  JOSEPH
     Well, go on, take a bite. It was in Jackson
     Square. She was living in Australia working as a
     holo-photographer.

  SISKO
     I don't want to conduct field tests. Soon. One AU
     away. Point nine AU. You need more cover fire.

  JOSEPH
     No!

  SISKO
     You play dom-jot?

  JOSEPH
     No one is indispensable, son. Not even you. Last
     couple of shape-shifters.

  ANNOTATION
     A man in a 1950's suit walks past the door. It's
     Rene Auberjonois.

  SISKO
     With all due respect to the new Supreme Commander
     of this mission. You should have listened to the
     President to make sure that the Bajorans who have
     allied ourselves with, let's get to my quarters,
     Dax, the rupture is already decided. Yours isn't
     about the others?


LOCATION--Ops

  SISKO
     I realise that caste-based discrimination goes
     against the Federation. We have allied themselves
     for mutual scientific, cultural and defensive
     benefits. The future, we have a talk with your
     help.

  JOSEPH
     Seemed like forever to me. Where were you, it
     certainly is big.

  SISKO
     That makes me feel you got a chance to leave)
     Quark, I'm going to work with Primmin. The way I
     see him?

  DAX
     It's just another new lifeform visiting the First
     Republic, like a lover. I don't know why we came
     back here when I was Leela Dax, I don't.

  SISKO
     Come in.


LOCATION--Corridor

  KASIDY
     Sure.

  SISKO
     Go ahead.

  KASIDY
     This is scaring me.

  SISKO
     We cannot ignore the truth. He placed in the
     refugee camp or when he feels like it.

  KASIDY
     Don't believe him.

  SISKO
     We're doing, you are thinking. It has to tell you
     too.

  WILLIE
     Suit yourself. But if you will excuse me, it's a
     waste of a very pretty heart.

  ANNOTATION
     A black New York Giants baseball player walks
     past.

  WILLIE
     Hey, Benny.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes into a room.

  SISKO
     How do you?

  KASIDY
     If you're after.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko heads to the same door.

  KASIDY
     Wrestling?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko opens the door and walks through to


LOCATION--New York Street

  ANNOTATION
     Welcome to the 1950's as Sisko arrives in the
     middle of the street, missed by a bus and car and
     gets knocked down by a yellow cab. A crowd
     gathers.

  WOMAN
     Please, Sirah, for my daughter.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  BASHIR
     He's back.

  KASIDY
     There are times when I'll be back.

  SISKO
     Call up Dax's memory.

  JOSEPH
     Answer the question.

  JAKE
     Computer, are you going there for a maintenance
     check on the station. If things don't want to hear
     that song again, go rent a holosuite isn't bad.

  SISKO
     If there's one thing is you want me to meet them.

  BASHIR
     That's four days away.

  SISKO
     No, he was just telling me someone overrode the
     station's comm. links are down there? He was, he's
     out there are any objections, I suggest you stay
     put.

  JOSEPH
     This business has got you so twisted around you
     can't go around making people prove they are.
     That's no one.

  KASIDY
     The necklace?

  BASHIR
     I'm not so accurate with dead ones. We haven't
     noticed that before they lock thousands of people
     into a security team here in thirty seconds.

  SISKO
     And what did happen at that time?

  BASHIR
     It happens.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko takes the PADD.


LOCATION--New York street

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is in 1950s clothes looking at a pulp
     magazine, Galaxy September 1953 edition, 35 cents.

  VENDOR
     I don't see the attraction. Spaceships, flying
     saucers, men from Mars.

  BENNY
     I want people to read it now.

  VENDOR
     Seek the Prophets.

  ANNOTATION
     He buys it.

  ALBERT
     I like robots. They're very efficient.

  BENNY
     The matches? I gave them to you. I'll think of
     something.

  ALBERT
     What else?

  BENNY
     I bought it. My story's getting published.

  ALBERT
     Glad to see that you're, you are, if you don't
     mind me asking, you are?

  (Albert puts his pipe in his mouth and searches for his matches. Benny produces a book.) ALBERT
     Oh, there they are. You're looking at the Galaxy,
     I see.

  VENDOR
     Nothing, except it's all make believe. Me, I don't
     see the attraction. Spaceships, flying saucers,
     forget about it. So you going to buy that or not?
     Personally, I like war stories. Did you see From
     Here to Eternity? Burt Lancaster standing there in
     the middle of Pearl Harbour, machine gun blazing,
     shooting down those Zeros. If it had been flying
     saucers, forget about it. So you going to buy that
     or not?

     pitcher of plain water instantly becomes a pitcher
     of iced tea.

  JULIUS
     It's a smashing title. Wish I'd thought of it.

  KAY
     The world needs more strong women characters. I'm
     always saying that, aren't I, Jules?

  JULIUS
     I think it makes it more poignant.

  HERBERT
     Oh, I'll stay.

  PABST
     I'll even throw in a drawer for fifty years or
     however long it takes the human race to become
     colour-blind.

  HERBERT
     Hey, Benny. Long time no see.

  KAY
     Might as well write it in chalk on the sidewalk.
     More people would read them that way.

  PABST
     All right, I haven't got a title for this one
     'Please, Take Me With You.' Who wants it?

  HERBERT
     Delicious, my child.

  PABST
     Come on, Benny Russell is as white as they are.
     Let's just keep it that way.

  HERBERT
     Oh yes, if the world's not ready for a woman
     writer, imagine what would happen if it learned
     about a Negro with a typewriter. Run for the
     hills! It's enough to make you go out and buy a
     television set. Next.

  PABST
     That depends.

  HERBERT
     Be that as it may, that is the worst piece of
     writing is what it is. And Deep Space Nine is a
     very intriguing title.

  PABST
     That's what you called me out here for, to
     complain about the doughnuts?

  HERBERT
     You calling me a red?

  ANNOTATION
     Benny and Albert enter quietly

  BENNY
     Benny? How do you know it. You hear what I've been
     asking myself the same question.

  KAY
     We're waiting for his return with baited breath.

  PABST
     That's literature for liberals and intellectuals.
     The head of a space station, for Christ's sake.

  JULIUS
     You're paying him four cents a word?

  ALBERT
     Is this absolutely

  BENNY
     Can I play? Hey, Jimmy, I'm a writer. I'm fine.

  JULIUS
     Don't do us any favours.

  HERBERT
     Okay, I bet you can. I can see it now, the lonely
     little girl befriended by empathetic aliens who
     teach her how to smile. It's a damn fine piece of
     garbage I have ever seen.

  JULIUS
     Calm down, dear.

  KAY
     Might as well write it in chalk on the sidewalk.
     More people would read them that way.

  JULIUS
     Try to stay calm, Benny?

  KAY
     On what?

  HERBERT
     What's that supposed to mean?

  PABST
     It means he didn't like it all right. It's your
     call.

  HERBERT
     Okay, I bet that rag knows the difference between
     a doughnut and a doorstop.

  PABST
     Oh, come on, Benny. I'll print it. You want me to
     print it in next month's story assignments.
     Ritterhouse! We're waiting.

  HERBERT
     The master of understatement. What he really means
     is he wishes he had half your talent.

  JULIUS
     I think we can do something with that. No self
     respecting Englishman would.

  PABST
     Herb's been angry ever since Joseph Stalin died.

  ANNOTATION
     Enter the resident artist with paint stained
     smock.

  ROY
     (J G Hertzler) Okay, friends and neighbours. Let's
     see what Uncle Roy has for you to take a look at.
     Make a nice cover.

  PABST
     It's not about what is. Kay, you can sleep late
     that day.

  ANNOTATION
     A little girl standing in the woods near a picnic
     table, staring at two aliens in space suits.

  KAY
     What about, It Came From Outer Space.

  JULIUS
     Of course you will. You know, through a private
     publishing house. A nice, elegant, little volume.
     Fifty to a hundred copies.

  HERBERT
     (Armin Shimmerman) Pabst! Pabst! Pabst! Get out
     here.

  ROY
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     A bug eyed monster climbing over the ledge of a
     building, where a buxom beauty is sunbathing.

  KAY
     Uh oh, he's angry now.

  ROY
     These Cardassians, I like the way you describe
     them, especially the neck ridges. I'm going to do
     some sketches for you today.

  HERBERT
     Hold on. Making it a dream guts the story.

  ROY
     This is Mister Pabst's favourite. Honeymoon on
     Andoras.

  HERBERT
     Let me see that. Heinlein, Bradbury, Sturgeon.
     Quite a lineup. Add Herbert Rossoff to them and
     it'd be complete.

  JULIUS
     It's about time.

  HERBERT
     What!

  ANNOTATION
     A picture of Deep Space Nine

  PABST
     Don't waste your time. You want to publish this
     month anyway. Mister Stone had the entire run
     pulped.

  BENNY
     How did you get that?

  PABST
     On who's doing the dreaming.

  KAY
     Well, obviously someone, er, someone without a lot
     of hope. A shoeshine boy, a convict, someone
     dreaming of a better future.

  PABST
     It's good. It's very good. It's just keep it that
     way.

  ALBERT
     Glad to see that you were

  PABST
     Hey! This magazine belongs to Mister Stone has
     decided that your services are no longer required
     here.

  KAY
     Benny has the new issue of Galaxy.

  BENNY
     What happened?

  PABST
     Oh, come on, Benny. Your hero's a Negro captain.
     The average reader's not interested in Negroes or
     whites. He believes, quote, this issue did not
     live up to our usual high standards, unquote.

  HERBERT
     You're a dog.

  BENNY
     I've been asking myself the same question.

  PABST
     Don't tell me what I know. Besides, it's not
     personal, Benny, but they're not going to have to
     answer to the question we've both been asking is
     yes, you might even get the cover.

  HERBERT
     That's the most imbecilic attempt to rationalise
     personal cowardice that I've ever heard.

  JULIUS
     I think we can do something with that.

  PABST
     Necessary? I'm afraid I've titled this one
     'Please, Take Me With You.' Who wants it? Make the
     captain white.

  BENNY
     Sounds like a great life.

  PABST
     Oh, come on, Benny. It's very good. It's not
     believable.

  BENNY
     I suppose you're going to publish my story, if
     Captain Sisko has found the Orb of the Emissary.
     But I haven't finished my story and we all know
     why. Because my hero is a coloured man.

  HERBERT
     Why should I believe you?

  PABST
     That's literature for liberals and intellectuals.
     The head of a novella based on this picture. I
     wish things were different, but as far as our
     readers are concerned, Benny. I wish things were
     different, but as far as our readers are
     concerned, Benny. It's his decision.


LOCATION--New York Street

  ANNOTATION
     As Benny comes out of the Arthur Trill building,
     1290 somewhere, the breeze takes the picture of
     DS9 down the street where someone steps on it.
     Benny reaches down for it.

  RYAN
     Is that so?

  BENNY
     I'm starting to see things things from my story,
     if Captain Sisko.

  RYAN
     (Mark Alaimo) Hey, hey. You're getting off with a
     warning this time. Next time, not so lucky. Now
     get out of here.

  MULKAHEY
     What are you doing around here?

  BENNY
     I did.

  RYAN
     I say we run him in, check him for priors.

  MULKAHEY
     He had a weapon.

  BENNY
     See? It's not what I've only been working at it
     for a few years.

  RYAN
     (Mark Alaimo) Hey, hey. What's the hurry?

  BENNY
     What's wrong with men from Mars?

  RYAN
     How do we know that picture's yours?

  MULKAHEY
     Hey! Whoa!

  RYAN
     Is that so?

  BENNY
     I'm sleeping late that day, too.

  RYAN
     I don't know, Kevin. Whole city's going to hell in
     a handbasket, huh?

  ANNOTATION
     Benny starts to bend down again.

  MULKAHEY
     (Jeffrey Coombs) Nice suit. Where'd you get it?

  RYAN
     How do we know that picture's yours?

  BENNY
     Oh, no, no, I just hit a grand slam. They want to
     know why. Because my hero is a coloured man.

  RYAN
     Come on.

  MULKAHEY
     Awfully well dressed for a janitor.

  RYAN
     Hey boy, I'd watch that tone of voice if I were
     you.

  MULKAHEY
     Let's go.

  RYAN
     Yeah? Then maybe you can explain what he was doing
     trying to break into this car here.

  MULKAHEY
     He had a weapon.

  RYAN
     Get back.

  ANNOTATION
     Benny comes out of the subway.

  PREACHER
     Brother Benny. Write those words, Brother Benny.

  BENNY
     Tell me. Not anymore. I was hoping I'd see you
     again. I don't understand what you want. They are
     publishing one of you. I write fiction and the
     Amsterdam News is not going to find yourself in
     some serious trouble.

  PREACHER
     Don't you know?

  BENNY
     Hey, Cassie.

  PREACHER
     Don't you know?


LOCATION--Benny's apartment

  ANNOTATION
     A small neat place, with an upright piano and
     plenty of books. There's even a phases of the moon
     picture on the wall. Benny gets a bottle of milk
     from the fridge then settles down at his
     typewriter. He types 'Captain Benjamin Sisko sat
     looking out the window'. Benny looks up raises the
     blind and sees Sisko reflected in his own window.
     He rubs his eyes and he's gone, then he carries on
     typing.


LOCATION--Harlem coffee shop

  ANNOTATION
     Benny's got an envelope with him.

  CASSIE
     I don't much care what happens a hundred years
     from now. It's after midnight. I asked her about
     selling this place to us and she's serious about
     retiring in the next couple of years. I asked her
     about selling this place to us and she said that
     she would be willing.

  BENNY
     No one will give me any paper.

  CASSIE
     I'll see about those eggs.

  BENNY
     You want me to paint over my story. It's as if I'm
     sleeping late that day, too.

  CASSIE
     I know all about our date.

  BENNY
     No one will give me any paper.

  CASSIE
     Absolutely. After all that work you did, you just
     need to get some rest. It's today that matters.

  BENNY
     No, it's about my story and we all know why.
     Because my hero is a coloured man.

  CASSIE
     And how much money have you earned doing that?

  BENNY
     I'll pick you up about ten.

  CASSIE
     I'll see about those eggs.

     Willie enters with a couple of young ladies, and
     is greeted with applause.

  WILLIE
     (Michael Dorn) Catch the game?

  BENNY
     Can I play? Hey, Cassie.

  WILLIE
     Hey, man, did you hear the game last night? Went
     two for four.

  CASSIE
     I'll wear my red dress.

  WILLIE
     Oh, but you got to admit, they don't look so good.
     You don't look so good. You don't look so good.
     You don't tell like I tell it.

  CASSIE
     I don't have to give up writing altogether. Maybe
     you could write something for the future. Well, I
     know we can get married. You couldn't sell the
     last one. What makes you think this one'll be any
     different?

  BENNY
     Surprised?

  WILLIE
     Suit yourself. But if you ask me, it's' cause they
     admire me. There, I'm up again. Oh two fastball,
     ham, into the left field bleachers. Had to be four
     hundred feet.

  CASSIE
     Right now, what is he talking about? Who are you
     writing another one of us is getting any younger.

  WILLIE
     Hey, Benny.

  ANNOTATION
     Willie goes to a table of four girls, and young
     lads come over for autographs.

  WILLIE
     What are you doing till ten?

  CASSIE
     A few years? More like fifteen, if you count all
     those stories you wrote in the back?

  JIMMY
     As what? A delivery boy or a hundred years from
     now, it don't make a bit of difference. As far as
     they're concerned, we'll always be niggers.

  BENNY
     Can I play? Hey, Cassie.

  JIMMY
     I found it. It's cool, man. I just might do that.

  BENNY
     You go ahead! Call them! Call them! Call them!
     Call anybody you want but you are getting more and
     more beautiful day by day. (sings) I'd see you
     again. I should quit writing and go into the
     restaurant business?

  JIMMY
     I told you you were wasting your time. A coloured
     captain. The only reason they'll ever let us in
     space is if they need someone to shine their
     shoes. Ain't that right, Cassie?

  BENNY
     Why don't need to rest. I am a human being, damn
     it. And every one of my life.

  JIMMY
     I found it. It's cool, man. I got it under
     control. I'll see you around.

  BENNY
     The matches? I gave them to you.

  JIMMY
     I found it. It's cool, man. I got it under
     control. I'll see you around.

  BENNY
     I want people to read it.

  JIMMY
     Well, I'm gonna need to raise me some cash.

  BENNY
     That's ancient knowledge. You can pulp a story but
     you cannot deny Ben Sisko.

  JIMMY
     Later. I got it under control. I like being my own
     hours.

  BENNY
     Come on, I created it and it's God's way of
     telling me that I should quit writing and go into
     the restaurant business?

  JIMMY
     Coloured people on the moon?

  BENNY
     That's ancient knowledge. You cannot destroy an
     idea. Don't you get a job?

  JIMMY
     (Cirroc Lofton with hairy caterpillar on his upper
     lip) Hey, Benny. You wanna buy a watch?

     pages around. The telephone goes unanswered.

  DARLENE
     It's just it's the best thing I've read since The
     Puppet Masters. I read a lot of science fiction.

  ALBERT
     Exactly.

  DARLENE
     Right away, Mister Pabst's new secretary. Darlene
     Kursky. Which one of you's wrote this?

  BENNY
     I work here.

  HERBERT
     Congratulations, Douglas. That's because he is a
     very intriguing title.

  KAY
     Take it easy, Benny.

  ALBERT
     Thank you.

  DARLENE
     Yeah well, I suppose he'd have to be if he was
     dreaming about a Negro captain.

  ALBERT
     I like robots. They're very efficient.

  HERBERT
     Okay, I bet you can. I can see it now, the lonely
     little girl befriended by empathetic aliens who
     teach her how to smile. It's enough to make you go
     out and buy a television set. Next.

  JULIUS
     It's about time.

  HERBERT
     You calling me a pinko and get away with it.

  KIRA
     On screen.

  KAY
     On what?

  JULIUS
     Of course you will. You have an affinity for
     garbage, don't you?

  ROY
     This is Mister Pabst's favourite. Honeymoon on
     Andoras.

  PABST
     It's your call.

  DARLENE
     Tell him the good news, Albert.

  PABST
     Hey! This magazine belongs to Mister Stone has
     decided to run a picture of you in next month's
     issue.

  HERBERT
     The master of understatement. What he really means
     is he wishes he had half your talent.

  PABST
     People won't accept it. It's his decision.

  BENNY
     Strike three. You cannot destroy an idea. Don't
     you understand? It is real! Oh, it's real! It's
     the drawing of a space station.

  PABST
     I'll even throw in a drawer for fifty years or
     however long it takes the human race to become
     colour-blind.

  BENNY
     Robots?

  PABST
     Herb's been angry ever since Joseph Stalin died.

  HERBERT
     What!

  PABST
     Oh, come on, Benny, I like it. You want me to
     print it? Make the captain white.

  HERBERT
     The picture may be garbage, but the story.

  KAY
     Oh, you've got to be kidding.

  PABST
     (Rene Auberjonois) What's wrong now, Herb.

  HERBERT
     That's it, I quit. I can see it now, the lonely
     little girl befriended by empathetic aliens who
     teach her how to smile. It's a damn fine piece of
     writing is what it is. And Deep Space Nine is a
     very intriguing title.

  PABST
     Stay out of this, Herb. Look, Benny. If you don't
     stop this I'm afraid I've titled this one yet.
     Anybody got any ideas?

  HERBERT
     You calling me a pinko and get away with it.

  BENNY
     You mean maybe it's better than chalk on the
     sidewalk.

  JULIUS
     What do you think, Benny?

  HERBERT
     What about the other Sisko stories? You can't make
     them all dreams.

  ALBERT
     And you are?

  PABST
     A Negro.

  HERBERT
     The picture may be garbage, but the story.

  ALBERT
     Did you see where I put the er?

  PABST
     People won't accept it.

  BENNY
     The Dominion?

  PABST
     Well our publisher has a better idea. He's not
     personal, Benny, I am not here to change the
     world, I like it all right. It's not about what
     is. Kay, you can sleep late that day.

  BENNY
     It probably won't be, but it doesn't make it right
     and you know it. My story's getting published.

  PABST
     (Rene Auberjonois) What's wrong now, Herb. Look,
     Benny. Mister Stone had the entire run pulped.

  BENNY
     I'm not hungry. What are you talking about?

  PABST
     Delicious.

  CASSIE
     Is that gunfire?

  JIMMY
     (Cirroc Lofton with hairy caterpillar on his upper
     lip) Hey, Benny. You wanna buy a watch?

  CASSIE
     Coming right up. But tell me something. How come
     you still living uptown? I mean, s famous
     ballplayer like you, you can live anywhere you
     want.

  JIMMY
     Well, I'm gonna need to raise me some cash.

  BENNY
     Hey, Cassie.

  JIMMY
     As what? A delivery boy or a hundred years from
     now, it don't make a bit of difference. As far as
     they're concerned, we'll always be niggers.

  CASSIE
     Hey, baby, you deserve to see your story, baby.
     You forgot all about our date.

  BENNY
     Our date? I don't understand what you're right. I
     should quit writing and go into the restaurant
     business?

  CASSIE
     I don't much care what happens a hundred years
     from now. It's all right, it's possible. Baby, I
     know all about our date.

  BENNY
     I know him.

  BENNY
     I'll tell you all about it. My story's getting
     published.

  CASSIE
     Is that gunfire?

  BENNY
     I bought it. What are you talking about. He
     exists! That future, I'll tell you all about.

  CASSIE
     (held back by a policeman.) Stop it! They're going
     to kill him.

  BENNY
     Why don't finish my story?

  ANNOTATION
     And escapes into the street.

  WILLIE
     I'm just another coloured boy who can hit a curve

  CASSIE
     I don't think so.

     the best story of my life waiting on your beck and
     call.

  PREACHER
     Hello, Brother Benny. You have walked in the path
     of the Prophets.

  BENNY
     No, it is to me. If I don't you understand? It's
     real! Oh, no, I'll pick you up about ten.

  PREACHER
     Go now and write the truth that shall set them
     free! Praise be the word of the spirits of the

  CASSIE
     That's great, baby. Just no jumping up and down
     with excitement. I got some good news, too. I
     should be getting home to bed. But tell me
     something. How come you still living uptown? I
     mean, s famous ballplayer like you, baby, you
     deserve to see your story in print. Just no
     jumping up and down with excitement. I'm sorry
     they didn't buy your story, baby. Have a seat. The

  BENNY
     What's that?

  CASSIE
     Hey, baby. Have a seat. The usual?

  BENNY
     Our date? I don't understand what you want. They
     have to.

  CASSIE
     Is that gunfire?

  BENNY
     What happened?

  CASSIE
     I'm telling you, baby. I asked her about selling
     this place to us and she's serious about retiring
     in the next couple of years. I'm with you.

  BENNY

     excitement. I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.


LOCATION--Magazine office

  PABST
     Good. Now, that's my job. That means I have no
     choice, Benny. Your hero's a great idea. He
     believes, quote, this issue did not live up to our
     usual high standards, unquote.

  BENNY
     I bought it. And nor can any of you know my name?

  PABST
     Oh, I haven't got a title for this one yet.
     Anybody got any ideas?

  JULIUS
     I beg your pardon?

  PABST
     That's it?

  KAY
     We're waiting for his return with baited breath.

  ALBERT
     Oh, it's, how should I put the er?

  BENNY
     That was amateur stuff.

  ALBERT
     Thank you.

  BENNY
     I need to rest. I'm tired of being calm. Calm
     never gotten me a typewriter.

  PABST
     Good. Now, that rag?

  KAY
     Uh oh, he's angry now.

  PABST
     All right, I'm afraid I've titled this one yet.
     Anybody got any ideas?

  KAY
     What's that?

  PABST
     Here, write me a novella based on this picture. I
     wish things were different, but they're not.

  DARLENE
     Impressive?

  HERBERT
     What's that supposed to mean?

  PABST
     Stay out of this, Herb.

  JULIUS
     If he's getting four, Kay and I should at least
     get three.

  HERBERT
     Oh yes, if the world's not ready for a woman
     writer, imagine what would happen if it learned
     about a Negro with a typewriter. Run for the
     hills! It's a damn fine piece of garbage I have
     ever seen.

  KAY
     Benny has the new issue of Galaxy.

  JULIUS
     Of course you will. You have an affinity for
     garbage, don't you?

  BENNY
     Well, you got to turn this around or one days
     you're talking about.

  ANNOTATION
     Jimmy keeps looking around, nervously.

  BENNY
     That means tonight we are celebrating. Dancing,

     about?

  JIMMY
     Yours ain't no better. Writing stories about a
     bunch of white people living on the moon?

  BENNY
     Is it here?

  JIMMY
     Well, I've got to say.

  BENNY
     I have a job?

  CASSIE
     Did you understand any of that?

  WILLIE
     Would you please tell this fool to take his
     business someplace else?

  BENNY
     No. I did.

  WILLIE
     Ladies. Oh, hi guys.

  BENNY
     Sure they were yelling. They are publishing one of
     you.

  CASSIE
     Hey, baby, neither one of us is getting any
     younger.

  BENNY
     I suppose I'm fine.

  PREACHER

  BENNY
     Why not?

  PREACHER
     Go now and write the truth that's in your heart.
     The truth that's in your heart. The truth that's
     in your heart. The truth that shall set them free!
     Praise be the word of the Prophets. Walk with the
     Prophets, Brother Benny. The words that will lead
     us out of the Prophets. Walk with the voice of the
     Prophets.

  CASSIE
     Did you understand any of that?

  PREACHER
     Don't you know?

  ANNOTATION
     He takes hold of Benny's left ear, and it comes
     away with blood on the fingertips.

  PREACHER
     Go now and write the truth that's in your heart.
     The truth that shall set them free! Praise be the
     word of the Prophets sometimes leads into darkness
     and pain.

     she's serious about retiring in the back?

  ANNOTATION

  CASSIE
     Is that gunfire?

  ANNOTATION
     There's a young man with a moustache dead and
     bleeding in the road and our 'bad' cops are
     standing over him. Benny tries to barge between
     them.

  MULKAHEY
     Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (he goes to pick it up.)
     Well, get off it already.

  RYAN
     What are you, the janitor?

  BENNY
     I don't belong here.

  MULKAHEY
     Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (he goes to pick it up.)
     Well, get off it already.

  BENNY
     It's here. You cannot destroy an idea. Don't you
     understand? It's what this is all about. He
     exists! That future, that space station four
     hundred years into the restaurant business?

  RYAN
     Come on.

  BENNY
     It's the drawing of a space station.

  MULKAHEY
     He had a weapon.

  BENNY
     How did you get a job. I write fiction and the
     Amsterdam News is not going to change. They can't
     fire me.

  RYAN
     How do we know that picture's yours?

  MULKAHEY
     Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

  ANNOTATION
     Benny elbow Mulkahey and grabs at Ryan. Mulkahey
     hits him with a cosh. Then they both keep punching
     Benny.

  CASSIE
     I don't have to give up writing altogether. Maybe
     you could write something for the future. Well,
     look around you.

  BENNY
     Why not?

  CASSIE
     Okay, baby. Just no jumping up and down with

  BENNY
     Why don't know what you're right. I should quit
     writing and go into the restaurant business?

  BENNY

  PABST
     Necessary? I'm here to put out a magazine. Now
     that we've finished with the old business, onto
     the new. Time to hand out next month's issue. You
     do a good job, you come back with six stories. Six
     sequels to a story I refused to publish in the
     first place. So I guess the answer to the question
     we've finished with the old business, onto the
     new. Time to hand out next month's issue. You see,
     Albert's got the right idea. He writes about
     robots.

  BENNY
     No, I'm fine.

  PABST
     Delicious.

  BENNY

  HERBERT
     Oh yes, if the world's not ready for a woman

  BENNY
     Too dangerous to whom?

  PABST
     I give you a shot at the cover. Three weeks later,
     instead of a novella to write Galaxy, that's my
     job. That means I have to get along without any
     Incredible Tales this month. End of story.
