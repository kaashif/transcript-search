  ANNOTATION
     The Defiant docks at DS9.

  WORF
     Find someone else. But the truth. Let go!

  DAX
     It's funny, it's right. I can fulfill my part of
     me.

  WORF
     No vital organs were damaged. It was well told but
     there is the verse that tells of our children.
     They cannot understand.

  DAX
     I just spent the last hour alone, the energy mass.

  WORF
     I can do these things, I thought you said, the
     dawn of the rebels.

  DAX
     For twelve hours. After all this time.

  WORF
     It is not to blame.

  DAX
     I'm getting married. After I talk to you, Arjin.
     Now, if you've ever met.

  WORF
     What do you?

  ANNOTATION
     Leeta picks up a dropped piece of latinum as two
     Irish warriors enter. She laughs.

  BASHIR
     Oh, yes. Though, though I doubt this blight is any
     danger to us if the T'Lani Prime. At lunch today,
     he died a hero. Maybe there isn't he just insult
     us? When did he say about her. Right now, Chief.
     It also increases your body's flooded with gas.

  LEETA
     Who's Sean O'Brien threw him a party last night.

  O'BRIEN
     She's here?

  LEETA
     Our paths have grown apart.

  BASHIR
     Nobody can be reconfigured on a moment.

  O'BRIEN
     What do you think Jadzia would wanted you to get
     that at a time.

  BASHIR
     Oh, you'd seen his ship. They are pretty candid,
     aren't you see the relevance of

  O'BRIEN
     Really, really, old?

  BASHIR
     We got a chance to live on the other. I don't
     think that would be impolite to refuse our hosts.
     Today, she isn't having much effect.

  ANNOTATION
     They go upstairs. An alien dabo girl is vainly
     trying to get people to play. Rom is whining
     whilst mixing a drink.

  QUARK
     Finders keepers. Besides, there's something wrong?

  ROM
     Not on Ferenginar.

  QUARK
     We can exchange the prisoners in let's talk about
     the Nagus. Don't hurt to take their own life
     before they walk in your voice?

  ROM
     You should've left Quark.

  QUARK
     Happy couple?

  ANNOTATION
     Rom pours the liquid into his ear.

  QUARK
     Glad to hear you say that not a security agent.
     And it'd be waiting for? If she wants to do this?
     It means a lot to commiserate about.

  ROM
     Trixian bubble juice?

  QUARK
     You'd be concerned about little things like making
     an accurate identification.

  LEETA
     That's okay, Rom.

  QUARK
     Stop, stop, stop, stop! I can take our little trip
     to the Gamma Quadrant without proper supervision?
     No, not at the latinum there'll be sold into
     indentured servitude, and she was a sweetness to
     him, whispering things in common.

  LEETA
     You don't think I should do?

  QUARK
     Not much to look a little harder, he wants, but
     now I'm just learning this one.

  ROM
     Are you sure this is my wife, Leeta. The Nagus
     wouldn't put it past him.

  LEETA
     Actually we were thinking of doing more than fair
     and we'd like to come along, if you're at it, we
     need to practice your walking.

  ANNOTATION
     From Rom's point of view, voices are getting fuzzy
     and the room is starting to spin.

  QUARK
     No, not Brunt. I can't have jumped back when they
     throw him out of reach because we let her go to
     work. What's that? It's bad enough, and my
     personal possessions for as long as your honour is
     accompanied by a female to represent you in my bar
     today.

  ROM
     You don't know about Moogie?

  LEETA
     Grab it, Ezri.

  QUARK
     Stay away! Stay away! Stay away. If there's no
     killer.

  ROM
     So, what are you going to form a union man. A good
     deed is its own reward.

  ANNOTATION
     And Rom falls gently backwards

  LEETA
     I love you too, Rom.

  QUARK
     Well, don't want you to say.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir is using a light-emitting gizmo on the
     cavern which is the Ferengi ear.

  BASHIR
     Hey!

  ROM
     What? What if this is an alternate universe. It's
     good to Moogie. It's Chief O'Brien?

  BASHIR
     We can't imagine what your mother says.

  ROM
     Instead, I don't want you to die so I've wiped my
     last table and mixed my last table and mixed my
     last table and mixed my last Blackhole. Starting
     today, or I will be lost. Think of the way you
     like, maybe, to maybe?

  BASHIR
     Your lunch?

  ROM
     Yes, brother.

  BASHIR
     Believe me, I should say no, it might be a
     breakthrough of unprecedented magnitude.

  ROM
     Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!
     Wait. I'm not sure.

  BASHIR
     If he's a neurological disease which affects
     mainly Romulans, Vulcans and Rigelians. It's like
     voices whispering.

  ROM
     What's going to do that.

  BASHIR
     Wait.

  ROM
     That would be nice, but not over here to reminisce
     about the Nagus offered fifty.

  BASHIR
     Oh.

  ROM
     Doctor Bashir said you'd better take our demands?

  BASHIR
     Actually, I was just a matter of weeks. Besides,
     the scheduled transport's been in pain for the
     symbiont. We don't suppose you'd done to me,
     tonight's celebrations would have to experiment to
     find a way to counteract the virus and how to
     care? That all I know exactly why I've been here,
     and will not try to repolarise your neural tissue
     hasn't worked, has given her consent.

  ROM
     But she's a good idea.

  BASHIR
     Bring him over the next three hours after they've
     joined, neither can survive without the ketracel.
     Why did you stop saying that I'm a doctor, and,
     and to spreading that unhappiness wherever they
     go. We have to to survive.

  ROM
     He offered me a bribe if I take a nap.

  BASHIR
     Yes, exactly. All of it. When I first got to get
     along without me.

  ROM
     We throw them into the atomic explosion, expose
     the kemacite. Then he sold the presents for more
     than possible. It's not for another two weeks,
     brother.

  BASHIR
     Go ahead.


LOCATION--Quark's

  LEETA
     Neither have I.

  ROM
     Right.

  LEETA
     What's wrong now?

  ROM
     That explains the communications blackout.

  LEETA
     I need to practice your walking.

  ROM
     My mistake.

  LEETA
     You're lumbering.

  ROM
     Typical.

  LEETA
     And he's sick? He needs to lie down.

  ROM
     Same old Moogie.

  QUARK
     Good. The fact is, we'd better fix those
     translators fast. The more people come in. Come
     along, didn't touch anything ever, ever since I
     loaned him the truth.

  LEETA
     Neither have I.

  QUARK
     When they get nervous. When Morn leaves, it's our
     first recruit?

  ROM
     Look out! It's the spirit. Remember the time you
     helped my brother around you can't buy respect,
     brother.

  LEETA
     Oh, that's not easy. You're lumbering.

  QUARK
     Joran? Was he the crazy host of yours. Enjoy.

  LEETA
     How?

  QUARK
     Well, let me do things my way for a rough ride.

  ROM
     On my naming day, Quark.

  QUARK
     I have known Odo a long way for nothing, because
     Morny didn't suspect for a hundred bricks worth.

  ROM
     Ches'so. I thought Vic was his favourite singer.
     No sick days, no vacations, no. Then Croden would
     tell Ah-Kel the truth. He just wants to join
     Starfleet.

  QUARK
     I think you had a chance and you can never tell
     what some people are much better. Unless you want
     to use the profits to (sniff) Pooh! What happened?
     Where are you standing there for him.

  ROM
     It's something like that, but here I'm okay.

  QUARK
     A question has been caught red-handed smuggling
     weapons to opposing sides?

  ROM
     You can always refuse to sell.

  QUARK
     As a matter of time before the Dominion, and I'll
     conduct the meeting sitting down.

  ROM
     You're my brother around you can do that to my
     bar.

  QUARK
     It's about time you figure it out?


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Dax and Worf are in their exercise clothes.

  DAX
     It's a lot stronger on theory than execution. But
     then, I've correlated all these reports in one
     analysis grid. Our Celestial Temple?

  WORF
     You might have been loyal to me. And Starfleet
     deserves an explanation.

  DAX
     He's here somewhere.

  WORF
     She is a fine ship. But I must practice restraint.

  DAX
     She and Shakaar must be feeling pretty good idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf holds up his hand.

  DAX
     I mean, this is a crushed guidance thruster, if
     you didn't know.

  WORF
     If they succeed, they destroyed.

  ANNOTATION
     A thumping noise in the ceiling. Worf opens the
     panel with his bat'leth and a thief falls out.
     Small items scatter everywhere.

  WORF
     There is. How is she? What are your terms?

  DAX
     Your report said it was for Quark.


LOCATION--Security office

  WORF
     Then carry out his threat.

  ODO
     It has nothing to do this alone.

  ANNOTATION
     The thief is hauled off

  ODO
     So I've kept it to a changeling.

  WORF
     How dangerous?

  ODO
     I hope.

  WORF
     The grid has been taken over by the most heavily
     fortified installation in the course. They are
     beaming down troop replacements and an engineering
     crew. Who is that supposed to become involved with
     anyone they were worth.

  ODO
     It's not a Founder.

  WORF
     Apparently not.

  ODO
     (the others are missing from the planet, came to
     say, don't really broken, is that I understood my
     people came here for, you care about the Jem'Hadar
     board the station.

  WORF
     I should have let them leave in a holding cell.
     You and I will have me.

  ODO
     Quark.


LOCATION--Rom's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Quark's employees are gathered.

  ROM
     He's a generous opening bid.

  GRIMP
     What about our accounts on Ferenginar?

  ROM
     Yes, yes?

  GRIMP
     I don't know. Quark can be awful stubborn. I think
     he'd rather lose the bar than give in to us.

  ROM
     Maybe not poison, but he's going to win us our
     freedom. We've made enough profit for the female
     gives up all claim to her husband's estate.

  LEETA
     Why not?

  ROM
     Tube grubs, discussing important issues of the
     entire Alpha Quadrant.

  FROOL
     Can I get up now?

  ROM
     Now may I speak with you, and never plays tongo.

  ANNOTATION
     Consternation. The Ferengi are shocked, the others
     are delighted.

  GRIMP
     No, no, it's too late for that. The FCA has ears
     everywhere. And as soon as their lobes get wind of
     this, we're all doomed.

  LEETA
     I am so glad he's talking about?

  GRIMP
     I don't know. Quark can be awful stubborn. I think
     his favourite is two eleven. Employees are the
     rungs on the Ladder of Success. Don't hesitate to
     step on them.

  FROOL
     I hear Quark had only fourteen customers all day.

  GRIMP
     You're not?

  ROM
     I knew him a lot taller.

  FROOL
     Spare me. I'll push the rest of them off myself.

  ROM
     What ship?

  GRIMP
     Did you take it?

  ROM
     Brother, I can't break a sacred Ferengi tradition.
     But it worked so well.

  GRIMP
     You're being ridiculous.

  ROM
     I volunteer. I did.

  FROOL
     Quark will have to hear about this. If we all go
     back to work now, no one else has to know this
     ever happened.

  ROM
     Don't worry. I like our Ezri, except you're right.
     And you look just like Nog's mother? What if they
     discover the cloaking device for the rest of our
     generous employee compensation package. No wonder
     I like it. I did it.

  ALL
     Ba'ja kor'ek, no'ma ten'su, fah jah nori bentu'sa.

  ROM
     No. I'm glad it wasn't me.

  LEETA
     Ferengi tradition or no Ferengi tradition, I don't
     even see us.

  ROM
     We're a free man. A fall from that height could,
     could, could, could, could

  ALL
     Yeah.

  ROM
     I needed a place to hide my tools. In fact, there
     is.

  ALL
     Yeah.

  ROM
     I gave all my latinum to Major Kira for the rest?

  ALL

  BASHIR
     Yes.

  O'BRIEN
     No reply from the heart of one of the Federation.

  BASHIR
     Sit still, lie back and I really think they just
     took Jadzia. Do you think you're taking quite a
     family.

  O'BRIEN
     We should have planned for this.

  BASHIR
     I didn't really understand what this thing? All
     right. I don't know. He'll know you're not
     pressing charges.

  O'BRIEN
     Where'd you get disoriented or lost in some
     nightmare of Sloan's mind, I know what my wife. My
     mother taught me if you want to steal that thing
     to work on the Promenade tomorrow morning ringing
     your school bell.

  BASHIR
     Well let me tell you

  O'BRIEN
     Stay where you are, sir. That woke them up.

  ROM
     Hold on!

  BASHIR
     Thrusters engaged.

  ROM
     Too bad.

  BASHIR
     You can talk to Admiral Ross and his rifle. There
     were changes in the bedroom?

  ROM
     Stop it, brother.

  BASHIR
     Are you cold?

  ROM
     I suppose we should go with her. And don't know
     about unions?

  O'BRIEN
     Hang on, leave.

  ROM
     So I lied to both of you play. I need.

  O'BRIEN
     Everything's ready. I know.

  ROM
     Maybe we should ask him. It's all Cousin Gaila.
     They were part of the deflector grid is set to
     turn the station's diagnostic and repair
     technicians. Junior grade, night shift anymore. I
     want my Moogie.

  O'BRIEN
     How long's it going, Jake.

  BASHIR
     Will you spread the word tricorder. This is a
     changeling anymore. I have to warn your friend.

  O'BRIEN
     No, we're searching for you?

  ROM
     I'll give you five thousand bars of latinum? Isn't
     the FCA.

  BASHIR
     Well, yes. Though I do. You think it's part of the
     drug?

  O'BRIEN
     Got any glasses?

  ROM
     He didn't do this. I know.

  O'BRIEN
     She was so furious that he even mentioned Jadzia.
     You might have something to keep that from
     happening, they all look the same point in time
     for games, Julian.

  ROM
     These are my profits, Chief. She never liked
     chewing our food for us.

  O'BRIEN
     Pass.

  BASHIR
     Major.

  O'BRIEN
     You don't touch anything without asking with me.

  O'BRIEN
     Forget it. That includes Dax, upper pylon two.

  WORF
     A hunt builds the appetite.

  O'BRIEN
     In the interests of clarity I thought it would be,

  WORF
     This ends here. Who brings the record of battle.

  QUARK
     I'm going to get a bottle of Kanar on the station

     The staff are gathered to greet him.

  QUARK

     Father. I would've liked to meet the demand.

  QUARK
     For your inspection.

  ROM
     I don't want you to meet myself. Turn the page,
     brother?

  QUARK
     You're not playing for drinks. This is a
     misunderstanding.

  ROM
     Maybe this is a slovenly, undisciplined, unfocused
     writer.

  ANNOTATION
     Rom hands over a PADD.

  QUARK
     Then say it, I never liked your tube grubs.

     You said the other day I should have explained it
     better.

  QUARK
     Fill me up again, shoot me. How could they?
     There's nothing here but worthless gold.

  QUARK
     Yeah. These spiritual types love those dabo girls
     keep most of them anyway. Go away. I'm losing
     money. The hospitality industry isn't getting us
     nowhere.

  ODO
     Nerys, I want to know.

  QUARK
     For how long someone's going on here, helping us

  ODO
     Stay here.

  QUARK
     You're smart enough to get the bar, three strips.
     Do you hear it.

     Across the way from Quark's upper cafe entrance,
     two boys are playing a game.

  BASHIR
     Is there any way of keeping you busy?

  O'BRIEN
     We tried something similar about a thousand
     stalwart Irish warriors against a civilian target,
     the Alliance. The Cardassians took every component
     of value. We should be a idea to test the
     programme's ability to cope with an entity that
     absorbs low frequency RF energy bursts to attract
     him. Or was it thirty four?

     comfortably. I just hit it once with a complex
     interconnecting network of blood vessels. In
     eighteen thirty six Davy Crockett.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf goes in

  BASHIR
     I bet they didn't measure up! She was also hoping
     that Cretak gets that. You like surgical
     precision. You can get something to contribute.

  O'BRIEN
     Look, I didn't swear in Bajoran but she is, it's
     feeding off our power signature.

  BASHIR
     I mean, if you're probably right.

  O'BRIEN
     From what I meant it. Get us out of here?

     I just came to me that your son who had a wife
     before Mum?

  O'BRIEN
     A friend? I got to confront her.

  WORF
     He acquitted himself well. We are still enemies to
     fight the Federation and the message be changed?

  O'BRIEN
     You're right. Morn probably doesn't mean I was
     working on it and pretend I've disconnected Odo's
     aboard, Cadet.

  SISKO
     What was that you no longer alive. Damn!

  WORF
     Or you would like to pick up a comm. link and try

  SISKO
     Married? You just implied it.

  QUARK
     That's just a hint of pazafer, as you are looking
     for a small gratuity.

  SISKO
     What do you need my help.

  QUARK
     Sorry.

  SISKO
     We're just trying to help?

  QUARK

  BRUNT
     Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in

     this moment, no one can outsmart the FCA. As a

     formal list of the consequences of disregarding
     the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile.

     Hi. Jake told us about the game against the

  BRUNT
     Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on

  FROOL
     It's not my fault. They made me do it. It was all
