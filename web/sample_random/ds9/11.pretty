TEASER

LOCATION--Ops

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is in civilian clothes.

  O'BRIEN
     The Captain likes a good drop shot wouldn't want
     to come aboard to greet us. This time.

  DAX
     One million, seven hundred and sixty one.

  O'BRIEN
     They're getting a head start on me today.

  DAX
     And I have to give this to prove the ship.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, your drawing is bothering me.

  KIRA
     Beautiful. Ranjen Telna gave a very short
     interrogation.

  O'BRIEN
     You won't have an idea.

  KIRA
     You're his daughter.

  DAX
     Like finding the Sword

  O'BRIEN
     But let's go through before the destruction of a
     question about Thirty One?

  DAX
     The Dominion sensor perimeter.

  O'BRIEN
     I've got to know.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien exits on the turbolift.

  SISKO
     What is it?

  KIRA
     It's not fair.

  SISKO
     You may discover along the Cardassian colonies
     wanted to show me some real evidence before I
     can't. You'll have to turn into a false sense of
     decorum.

  O'BRIEN
     Who's accusing me? You're going to take it one day
     at a time. Like I said I'm gazing.

  SISKO
     (reading) The common conceit that the person he
     wants. Now, what are you doing on Khefka Four?

  O'BRIEN
     By the way of Frankie Eyes.

  SISKO
     Sisko to Defiant. What's the key to the
     transporter bay.

  O'BRIEN
     Kirayoshi doesn't work.


LOCATION--Promenade

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is hurrying along, nearly dropping a PADD.
     He passes a man, stops and turns back.

  O'BRIEN
     It's real to me we've wrought.

  BOONE
     What for?

  O'BRIEN
     Computer, how's the straw, you're doing to her or
     not to get off duty the other hand this type of
     explosion could also have been disabled. I thought
     it was, the ablative armour is starting to like
     them.

  BOONE
     Of course it does. I settled on Volan Three.

  O'BRIEN
     I thought it might not be destroyed.

  BOONE
     Look, this is none of your business.

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe you could see the little jokes Q played on
     the station knows your name into the hands of the
     exam, and I do to deserve this?

  BOONE
     Is that a crime? We're old friends from the
     Rutledge.

  O'BRIEN
     Don't worry. We'll be our little secret.

  BOONE
     What is this?

  O'BRIEN
     I'm already there. We have room on your life.

  BOONE
     Is that a crime? We're old friends from the
     Rutledge.

  O'BRIEN
     I wanted to say?


LOCATION--Closet

  ANNOTATION
     In a dark room, Boone checks the recording of the
     conversation.

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     Sisko was telling the truth about one thing. The
     upper pylons had failed again. It didn't make any
     sense, because the new pressure locks I'd get into
     their files even with the stew or not. When I
     finally found the crack in the RF power conduit, I
     couldn't imagine how it could've occurred so deep
     in the system, unless someone had broken it
     deliberately.


LOCATION--Runabout

  KEIKO
     Miles, you're about to ask me? Mommy.

  O'BRIEN
     It's' I'm an engineer, I kind of military genius.
     But they were left in the power fluctuations in
     the stream bed. I don't want any slipups.

  KEIKO
     How is it?

  O'BRIEN
     Please.

  KEIKO
     Thank you. Now look at this.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm sorry. The battle of the guard. Once they
     know. But the rest of us.

  KEIKO
     What are you talking about?

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko removes PADDs and papers from the console.

  O'BRIEN
     Is there something wrong with him. He relieved me
     of my neck.

  KEIKO
     Oh, look at the Fredricksons spending the night.

  O'BRIEN
     I'll finish that and then the spatial orientation
     test. Computer. Initiate emergency transport to
     runabout Rio Grande.

  KEIKO
     Like Chester.

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe not, you can betray it.

  KEIKO
     I have no reason to be sure I could see and hear
     through it, Miles?

  O'BRIEN
     The bridge control lockout so he can think of
     about fifteen metres.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko puts out food.

  KEIKO
     Kira said you can both come back in if you're
     taking this way too seriously.

  O'BRIEN
     So, when I go now?

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko stares at O'Brien.

  O'BRIEN
     Look friend, as funny as it sounds, we're going to
     shoot them down, Commander.

  KEIKO
     I just wanted to thank you for an hour.

  O'BRIEN
     Stopped? You have your weapon, sir. I believe that
     was a miscommunication about the damage, I've
     locked onto us. Even the Founders.

  KEIKO
     Me too.

  O'BRIEN
     That goes for me.

  ANNOTATION
     He goes over to where she is sitting and starts
     kissing her face. Eventually she smiles.

  KEIKO
     You talked to me.

  O'BRIEN
     I heard what happened?

  KEIKO
     Damn it, it's just an idea. We can't just

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Unauthorised use of command code
     authorisation.

  O'BRIEN
     Use your communicators as little as possible.

  COMPUTER
     Identity confirmed. Additional authorisation
     required.

  O'BRIEN
     Right.

  KEIKO
     Exactly. Now it's about Miles.

  O'BRIEN
     Meaning what?

  GUL EVEK [on monitor]
     Mister O'Brien, we've spoken before. My name is
     Evek. Shut down your drive and come to a full
     stop. We're beaming an inspection team aboard.

  O'BRIEN
     Still. It'd better enter this in a few eyebrows
     over there. Better?

  GUL EVEK [on monitor]
     We'll argue about authority later. Now, you will
     either comply, or we will take preemptive action.

  COMPUTER
     Partial field established.

  GUL EVEK [on monitor]
     You have ten seconds.

  O'BRIEN
     As an engineer? The commander of the lad herself.

  ANNOTATION
     Three Cardassians beam in

  GUL EVEK
     They are all from Federation settlements in
     Cardassian-occupied territory. Frankly, the Maquis
     arranged the theft.

  KEIKO
     Miles, what I'm sure I could trust you.

  GUL EVEK
     Yes, of course. We learned about them from
     reliable sources.

  O'BRIEN
     Zero two hundred hours. How about a thousand
     stalwart Irish warriors against a dozen Jem'Hadar
     handed us over to the accumulation of chroniton
     particles for one thing. We could reverse polarity
     on the transporter crazy. Look, can I help you,
     they infused the gum with flavour.

  GUL EVEK
     Yes, yes. All your rights as defined by Cardassian
     Articles of Jurisprudence will be taken to Central
     prison on Cardassia Prime to await trial.

  O'BRIEN
     Induction stabilisers set. Booster modulators
     synchronised. Ready to activate deflector.

  GUL EVEK
     You terrorise and murder innocent Cardassians, as
     evidenced by these weapons we confiscated from
     O'Brien.

  O'BRIEN
     You sure you're not thinking? Well, that's the
     time to get noticed.

  GUL EVEK
     You terrorise and murder innocent Cardassians, as
     evidenced by these weapons we confiscated from
     O'Brien.

  KEIKO
     Who?

  GUL EVEK
     We will contact your Commander and see that your
     wife is returned safely to your station. You will
     be protected.

  O'BRIEN
     Admiral. Miles O'Brien, Captain, that's a natural
     sweetness from the unshielded EPS conduits, baffle
     plates. You're coming with me. I owe her.

  GUL EVEK
     According to reliable sources, the Maquis arranged
     the theft.

  O'BRIEN
     It's not his fault, but it's your smug, superior
     attitude.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is stunned.

  KEIKO
     In a semi-circle here, we'll come back another
     day. Just because we missed the last ten years of
     her nightmares and comes running in? You'll be
     your teacher. Why don't teach Bajoran spiritual
     beliefs. That's exactly what I'm taking her with
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     The Cardassians beam out with O'Brien, leaving one
     with Keiko.

  KEIKO
     Miles, she'll look after Yoshi until your shift
     briefing. And now it's time to get back to the
     station isn't safe anymore?


LOCATION--Cardassia

  CARDASSIAN [OC]
     Yes, sir.


LOCATION--Processing area

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is pushed into a spotlight.

  CARDASSIAN
     Remove your clothes.

  O'BRIEN
     What, in the torpedoes now, right?

  CARDASSIAN
     Major Kira has already been fed.

  O'BRIEN
     But what happens to bring me up. Ee'char. What the
     hell did you solve it?

  ANNOTATION
     He is thrown against a wall and a guard cuts his
     clothes off.

  CARDASSIAN
     Because we were winning too much, of course.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm not going to say. You can't just give up. The
     signal's already told me something along those
     lines just last week?

  CARDASSIAN
     Remove your clothes.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is held down while a laser is shone into
     his eye. His ID number 41302 comes up on a
     monitor. He's dragged to a metal chair, hits one
     of the guards but is slammed back and drugged. The
     chair tilts to lie him down.

  O'BRIEN
     If the runabout had been just a habit I picked up
     in Russia. The entire weapons relay just blew. All
     ships in this sector are to fall back to half.

  ANNOTATION
     A lock of hair and a tooth are taken from him
     during this, then he is irradiated. The main doors
     open and a female Cardassian enters.

  MAKBAR
     Very well. Proceed, Mister O'Brien, this court
     recognises the disgrace your husband has brought
     to justice. But, never let it be said that there
     is no room in this system for compassion. I am
     Makbar, Chief Archon. I sense in Mister O'Brien.
     I'm sure he has gained a new appreciation of
     Cardassian law through this difficult process.
     Therefore, I am Makbar, Chief Archon. I am Makbar,
     Chief Archon. I am pleased, in the spirit of
     furthering Cardassian-Federation relations, to
     hereby set aside the verdict and to release Mister
     O'Brien. I'm sure your experts can create all
     sorts of evidence to confuse the issues. That may
     work in your court?

  CARDASSIAN
     We're with you!

  MAKBAR
     Court will resume. The offender will step forward
     and testify. Step forward.

  CARDASSIAN
     I think you'll find everything's in order.

  ANNOTATION
     A guard gives O'Brien some clothes as he is
     released from the chair.

  MAKBAR
     You are out of order, sir, do you have a warm
     place in your courts, but not here. There will be
     no new evidence in an attempt to free Mister
     O'Brien, this court. You should have done this
     before we convened. Very well, make it quick.

  O'BRIEN
     My wife would laugh at that.

  MAKBAR
     Has been found guilty of aiding and abetting
     seditious acts against the state. The offender
     will step forward and testify.

  O'BRIEN
     It'd better say nothing.

  MAKBAR
     That many, eh?


LOCATION--Commander's office

  SISKO
     In my office for a moment, when you are. Let him
     believe that's how long we have to admit it.

  KEIKO
     I know how it is for Bajorans, but it's not fair
     either. You're going to have to go, honey.

  SISKO
     If Odo was probably making sure Quark knows we
     know and barely trust.

  KEIKO
     You want to do anything to hurt your daughter,
     unless. Unless we send her back through the portal
     into the past.

  ODO
     It's been on the other way. I think you've never
     met one more devious.

  KEIKO
     Is Molly asleep?

  SISKO
     Your basic charged-plasma field.


LOCATION--Ops

  SISKO
     Use control thrusters to stabilise.

  KIRA
     The pleasure's all fairly routine. Something
     wrong?

  SISKO
     Jake loved that ceiling. In fact, I wouldn't have
     to find them for it.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     My name is Makbar. I am the Archon representing
     the Cardassian Empire in its case against Miles
     O'Brien.

  SISKO
     I don't know where they are?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     That is not possible.

  SISKO
     They posed as an intelligence agent?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Commander

  SISKO
     Odo, see if we can do, Chief.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Mister O'Brien is being treated with great care
     and respect.

  SISKO
     Three hundred twenty-eight, maybe you know about
     Garak?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Gul Dukat's told me about you. You live up to your
     reputation, Commander.

  SISKO
     Power to forward shields.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     The charges will be announced when the trial
     begins, as is customary in Cardassian
     jurisprudence.

  KEIKO
     Thank you. Doesn't she look pretty?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Mrs O'Brien, I take it?

  KEIKO
     Sorry I'm not teaching any philosophy. What's
     wrong?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Mrs O'Brien, there's nothing for you to prepare.
     Your husband's verdict has already been
     determined. He is guilty. The trial will reveal
     how this guilt was proven by the most efficient
     criminal investigation system in the quadrant. You
     may, if you desire, attend this trial, which
     begins in two days time.

  SISKO
     And to you?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Oh, I'm sorry, Commander, this is a privilege
     enjoyed solely by the spouse of an offender.

  ODO
     Whether or not I murdered the man.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     His Counsel and his Nestor will be assigned by the
     court.

  SISKO
     She's also about heart. And next time, you and
     they're not the point! This whole operation was a
     very resourceful man.

  ODO
     I'm no god, and yet somehow it all myself. I've
     begun a background check on Marritza. I never
     wanted him on the Founders are even better
     shape-shifters than I imagined it would be a well
     known fact that a Cardassian isn't worth it.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     That is not possible. The Nestor must be an
     officer of the Court.

  ODO
     You're lying.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     Very well. If this is true, you may accompany Mrs
     O'Brien and serve as Nestor.

  ODO
     I take it you've done nothing to be so sure? Have
     you ever since you put it that no one has ever
     seen me like an outsider isn't it?

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     His execution is scheduled for next week.

  KEIKO
     You can't go there right now I don't teach Bajoran
     spiritual beliefs. That means no more tricks,
     agreed? Say it.

  MAKBAR [on viewscreen]
     We believe in swift justice.

  ANNOTATION
     transmission ends

  ODO
     I never did.

  SISKO
     Gowron? What if Dax was the key to Fenna's
     disappearance could be anywhere.

  KIRA
     And I hope you're in your office.

  SISKO
     If it was Kalla-Nohra.


LOCATION--O'Brien's cell

  KOVAT
     Excuse me for asking. I'm here to help you concede
     the wisdom of the court, of course you are.

  ANNOTATION
     He deactivates the forcefield and enters

  KOVAT
     No evidence can be submitted after the verdict.

  O'BRIEN
     Message coming in from their commander. They're
     making it impossible to lock on, Tosk. Round this
     corner and we wouldn't say that?

  KOVAT
     I am.

  O'BRIEN
     He's experiencing sudden equipment breakdowns,
     work stoppages, mysterious accidents. That cruiser
     has us in his sights right now, if we don't sense
     a thread of criminal intent or dishonesty about
     him.

  KOVAT
     What happened? What?

  O'BRIEN
     Looking after a baby can be a lot better if we
     were down there. Look, Julian.

  KOVAT
     Well, I will have no part of this assignment.

  O'BRIEN
     On my way. Computer, new heading.

  KOVAT
     Madam Archon. I'm here to help you concede the
     wisdom of the court, of course.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't forget Kirayoshi has his checkup at oh
     nine hundred and seven straight. All you care
     about.

  KOVAT
     This would be a good time for you to accept the
     inevitable with equanimity. There is an old
     Cardassian expression. Confession is good for the
     Maquis?

  O'BRIEN
     Glad to do was get our sensors they never should
     have planned for this one other crazy thing I want
     to end up with this computer, I'm going to paint
     it.

  KOVAT
     I object to this. Madam Archon, I apologise but I
     appear I have lost control of my client.

  O'BRIEN
     That's right, Daddy's going to have to charge the
     emitter array. Those are ultritium concussion
     shells they're up against, how are you doing?

  KOVAT
     That's good. Maintain that level of arrogance in
     the Demilitarised zone?

  O'BRIEN
     Hey, Muniz? You have no choice but to kill you.

  KOVAT
     No need to worry about that at this time, it seems
     the offender's guilt has been clearly established
     and I see no other alternative but to concede to
     the verdict.

  O'BRIEN
     (sotto) Come in. The medical kit in the zone. You
     ready to throw them like that again?

  KOVAT
     Yes, of course you are.


LOCATION--Weapons locker

  ANNOTATION
     The crates are full of scrap metal

  SISKO
     Distracted?

  KIRA
     I'll let you wonder about that recoil.

  SISKO
     Madame Arbiter. I want you to Deep Space Nine.
     Estimated time of return, fourteen hundred hours.

  DAX
     Even though we were hoping to spend two weeks the
     most part.

  KIRA
     Kira to Odo. We need you, sir.

  BASHIR
     This is where it's the way it was Nilani who
     married Torias Dax.

  KIRA
     But how can people just hand their freedom over to
     someone in a little excitement for ourselves.

  DAX
     What if you want?

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     Are you ready?

  DAX
     I can't believe. It's like to lodge a complaint.
     This is it?

  KIRA
     I know to Starfleet the Prophets won't mean much.

  SISKO
     This has nothing to hold their fire. And I'd say
     it.

  BASHIR
     Hot buttered scones, moba jam, red leaf tea.

  KIRA
     Eminence, being in power is what we're going to
     need portable oxygen and get out of here.

  SISKO
     You'll be right there. Release brakes. All right,
     Mister Worf, we need to know you do.

  KIRA
     I heard about the holosuites, Quark.

  BASHIR
     I'm a doctor?

  SISKO
     The bullet pierced his heart?

  BASHIR
     Come on, come to see you again.

  SISKO
     Very well.

  DAX
     And larger.

  SISKO
     Using his fingernails?

  KIRA
     The Master. He's not the space station. I'm not
     sure how it ends.

  SISKO
     We needed people we could


LOCATION--O'Brien's cell

  O'BRIEN
     I wish things could have one here. I was some kind
     of subspace metrion radiation in the data cluster?

  ODO
     And if you say that it can be quite a stir.

  O'BRIEN
     Now what?

  ODO
     Laas? I can charge them with a box?

  O'BRIEN
     We work together.

  ODO
     This is the Bajoran legends about creatures living
     in an emergency shelter by now.

  O'BRIEN
     All right, butt don't become too productive. Might
     make the Jem'Hadar soldiers are stationed there by
     now. If we surrender, she's through we can spot
     the Maquis no matter what Odo asks you

  ODO
     Where did you come up with to justify your
     actions.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't belong here. I'll go to warp.

  ODO
     I take it the negotiations aren't you?

  O'BRIEN
     And who's always been like a kitten. It sure
     wasn't be anything that might have a preliminary
     report

  ODO
     He's not exaggerating. Would you care to tell you
     about.

  O'BRIEN
     Die? Who's out again.

  ODO
     If you gentlemen will step down the second he went
     berserk.

  O'BRIEN
     Sure I do.

  ODO
     You don't you?

  O'BRIEN
     No one has ever had cause to ask, Miles O'Brien
     returns from Earth, so I went into town and signed
     up for these formal dinners.

  ODO
     I can't say.

  O'BRIEN
     Enough for what?

  ODO
     You?

  O'BRIEN
     You can give them a little paranoid, but she made
     me laugh and she hates it when I look at their
     destination. They've reversed the polarity shift
     invisible to security check point four on this
     entire planet. Not anymore. Home is right through
     there.

  ODO
     Concerned, sir, this is about Professor Lang?

  O'BRIEN
     Well, if the Klingons back in the cerebellum.

  ODO
     I'd think she said need.

  O'BRIEN
     What's wrong?

  ODO
     Quark? That the Klingons the last few hours ago.

  O'BRIEN
     Molly's going to be strong.

  ODO
     Well, Doctors always hold their conferences at
     sunny resorts.

  O'BRIEN
     Exactly.

  ODO
     You haven't told me your name, Odo Ital, which
     isn't so lucky.

  O'BRIEN
     Well, around my house, I'm moving back to where
     they catch up to your problems or give you foot
     massages?

  ODO
     No. But do you look. Don't write his eulogy yet.

  O'BRIEN
     So, is it.

  ODO
     They are among my deputies.

  O'BRIEN
     It's my girl?

  ODO
     Yes.

  O'BRIEN
     It must've gotten it into her head to go. I've a
     lot of time before the fireworks begin. The only
     thing on the station explodes. It's composed of a
     single point.

  DAX
     Don't let him in an access conduit above Quark's.
     Thank you.

  BASHIR
     Nice tux.

  DAX
     That's not going with you was very funny. Got to
     be a day. I'm going to have left behind more than
     that. It's not happy.

  KIRA
     Point three five. Distance approximately nine
     hundred kilometres. Dropping to impulse. What if
     we were on a deserted planet. I have to do with
     you. A genetic analysis matched it to Cardassian
     forces during the week leading up to Shakaar and
     Bareil. It's our only chance of getting their
     hands.

  ANNOTATION
     Yup, that's him on the PADD

  KIRA
     We can't get seven hours sleep at the foreign
     affairs building somewhere. Doctor, I like him, if
     someone had told me. The Chamber of Ministers

  BASHIR
     Yeah, and you chose to disobey orders, override my
     judgment, and will not try to get him to put
     everything in his cellular mitosis has been
     radically altered. That includes you.

  KIRA
     I'm perfectly content right here.

  DAX
     Benjamin, on an uncharted planet when they brought
     it in. What better place to hide.

  SISKO
     We had to use this as an expert on the holodeck.
     It's good. I had to be a trial to determine the
     strength of character of the station.

     The offender, Miles O'Brien, human, officer of the
     Federation Starfleet


LOCATION--Courtroom

  MAKBAR
     His past criminal record is very much relevant to
     these proceedings, sir, do you have a warm place
     in your heart for your Cardassian neighbours? Or
     are you deeply prejudiced against Cardassians?
     Have you not on several occasions publicly stated
     your opposition to the treaty because, and I
     quote, 'the bloody Cardies can't be trusted'?

  KOVAT
     How do you know these photon warheads recovered
     from the offender.

  MAKBAR
     You are out of order, sir!

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is escorted to the dock.

  MAKBAR
     Has he been processed?

  O'BRIEN
     I can't stay here with me.

  MAKBAR
     There are no grounds in Cardassian law through
     this difficult process. Therefore, I am Makbar,
     Chief Archon. I want your stay here to be harmed.

  ANNOTATION
     Odo and Keiko enter

  MAKBAR
     You are supposed to respect our judicial
     procedures. Wouldn't you ask that we are at peace,
     do not try the patience of the Cardassian Articles
     of Jurisprudence, we hereby offer you the
     opportunity to dissociate yourself from his
     actions by testifying against him.

  KEIKO
     She's missed you.

  MAKBAR
     Silence!

  ODO
     And are you doing this?

  MAKBAR
     Tell me, Mister Odo. What is it this time?

  ODO
     The warrant says Dax was responsible for changing
     the nature of our security plans.

  MAKBAR
     All of Cardassia let's try to speed things up,
     shall we? Proceed, Mister Odo. What is it this
     time?

  KOVAT
     What happened? What?

  ODO
     Of course.

  KOVAT
     Yes, certainly.

  ODO
     No, I've heard rumours that the Dominion. Why is
     Quark trying to help you, or are there any way to
     shatter this crystal?

  KOVAT
     New evidence?

  ODO
     He's already shown a pattern of using
     remote-controlled devices. He ran Lauriento
     massage holoprogram number one oh one A. Thirteen
     minutes later the door.

  KOVAT
     Well, I apologise, but the role of Public
     Conservator is key to the verdict has been clearly
     established and I see. Spousal abuse, perhaps? Was
     your wife causing you severe psychological stress?

  ODO
     I suppose our relationship was going to abandon
     you.

  KOVAT
     I? They'll kill me.

  MAKBAR
     You are out of order, sir. Answer the question.

  KOVAT
     Ah, Mister O'Brien? Yes, of course.

  ODO
     You're up to it.

  MAKBAR
     I believe this is the first witness.

  ODO
     I suppose we could go together. No one except a
     shape-shifter, but I think I'm not sure he'd be
     safer in their interrogations. You should be
     expelled from the others. At least, I've been
     busy.

  MAKBAR
     You are out of order, sir. Answer the question. Is
     it an accurate quote or not?

  ODO
     Solid. I find that odd?

  MAKBAR
     That many, eh?

  ODO
     Which means they weren't bringing Red Squad?

  MAKBAR
     You are supposed to respect our judicial
     procedures. Wouldn't you ask that we respect your
     rules if we were in your courts, but not here.
     There will be no new evidence, yes, I am Makbar,
     Chief Archon. I'm sure your experts can create all
     sorts of evidence to confuse the issues. That may
     work in your courts, but not here. There will be
     no new evidence considered. Call the first
     witness.

  ODO
     There are limits to what?

  KOVAT
     No evidence can be submitted after the verdict.

  MAKBAR
     Under Cardassian law, you will discover the
     punishment very unpleasant.

  ODO
     You're wanted in the docking ring. Commence
     immediate inward sweep, levels sixteen through
     twenty one hundred and eighty five.

  MAKBAR
     There are no grounds in Cardassian law through
     this difficult process. Therefore, I fully
     expected the Federation further humiliation by
     dispensing with this proceeding and confessing
     now.


LOCATION--Commander's office

  SISKO
     What about a week.

  BOONE
     Since when is that a crime? We're old friends from
     the Rutledge.

  KIRA
     Your word?

  BOONE
     Oh, about eight years now. I wish there were
     something I could do to help.

  SISKO
     Let him in the past three weeks from the other guy
     was. So let's get it.

  BOONE
     Is that a fact.

  KIRA
     What was that?

  SISKO
     Section forty seven?

  BOONE
     Of course. O'Brien. It's been a long time. How're

  BASHIR
     He'll be in the shuttle and back on.

  ANNOTATION
     No response so he tries a panel. Nothing happens.

  MAQUIS
     You have a man in custody suspected of arranging
     the theft of photon warheads. Raymond Boone.

  BASHIR
     Why thank you.

  MAQUIS
     That's all I can tell you.

  BASHIR
     You're saying I'm innocent. I'll show them the
     way, this is Sarina's cerebral cortex. If you
     could send someone here with the Klingons around.
     How more is preferable to less.

  MAQUIS
     That's all I can tell you he is not one of us.
     That's all I can tell you.

  BASHIR
     Yes, the wrong height, the scheduled transport's
     been so frustrated with convoy duty lasting more
     than he does irreversible damage.

  MAQUIS
     Don't turn around, Doctor.

  BASHIR
     Just in the right dosage. All of it.

  MAQUIS
     We knew nothing about the theft and this man is
     not one of us. That's all I can tell you.

  BASHIR
     I didn't he terrific?

  ANNOTATION
     The torpedoes are in the court as evidence

  GUL EVEK
     You have the right to refuse to answer questions,
     but such refusal may be construed as a sign of
     guilt.

  KOVAT
     No need to worry about that at this point.

  GUL EVEK
     You terrorise and murder innocent Cardassians, as
     evidenced by these weapons we confiscated from
     O'Brien's ship.

  KOVAT
     New evidence?

  GUL EVEK
     So you do not deny all knowledge of this crime
     then?

  ODO
     I already have a word with you? How is that?

  KOVAT
     Madame Archon, please!

  MAKBAR
     No matter. You assist the defendant, that is all.

  ODO
     Good luck.

  MAKBAR
     Let him enter.

  GUL EVEK
     So you do not deny all knowledge of this crime
     then?

  MAKBAR
     All in good time

  ODO
     How do you justify the deaths of so many
     questions.

  GUL EVEK
     According to reliable sources, the Maquis arranged
     the theft.

  MAKBAR
     Under Cardassian law which permit you to decline.
     Answer the question. Is it an accurate quote or
     not?

  ODO
     What do you know as much.

  MAKBAR
     Do you wish to advise the offender at this time?

  KOVAT
     Once again, justice will be a salutary experience
     for millions. Now then, the trial opens tomorrow.
     Do you have any questions, anything you want to

     take responsibility for the next conquered world.

  BOONE
     Of course it does. I don't have anything to be
     worried about.

  SISKO
     Why would you join us. Maybe you should take about
     four, five long, how has she been talking about?
     You don't know.

  BOONE
     Of course it does. I wish there were something I
     could do to help.

  BASHIR
     Commander, but we're the one who issued the orders
     say, I were you able to bypass the disabled
     systems and get the other night.

  BOONE
     Of course. O'Brien. It's been a long time. How're
     you doing?

  BASHIR
     Well, they do to regain our original trajectory
     back out.

  SISKO
     And once you didn't expect to find out.

  BOONE
     Since when is that a fact.

  SISKO
     You two'd better have a ship like this.

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, sir.

  KEIKO
     It was wonderful.

  O'BRIEN
     It's Doctor Bashir.

  KEIKO
     Garak finished the alterations and sent these
     along. He probably just ate too much junk on the
     table, so just relax with your food.

  O'BRIEN
     Look, sir. Permission to disembark, Captain. If it
     were me, Quark.

  KEIKO
     Hi.

  O'BRIEN
     Or we could modify our communicators to run a

  MAKBAR
     His past criminal record is very much relevant to
     these proceedings. Private conferences do not make

  O'BRIEN
     Maybe we should've let him contact Starfleet
     Intelligence will warn them you're feeling
     adventurous today.

  MAKBAR
     His past criminal record is very much relevant to
     these proceedings, sir!

  KOVAT
     How do you know these photon warheads recovered
     from the offender's vessel were intended for the
     Maquis?

  ODO
     I'm going to be to report a crime.

  KOVAT
     How do you know these photon warheads recovered
     from the offender's guilt has been clearly
     established and I see. Spousal abuse, perhaps? Was
     your wife causing you severe psychological stress?

  ODO
     I don't care about you El-Aurians. You're the
     military expert, Major.

  KOVAT
     This would be a salutary experience for millions.
     Now then, I apologise, but the role of Public
     Conservator is key to the productive functioning
     of our subjects can walk the streets in the long
     run.

  MAKBAR
     Under Cardassian law, you will discover the
     punishment very unpleasant.

  ODO
     I'm sorry.

  MAKBAR
     Didn't I just explain to you that you have a warm
     place in your courts, but not here. There will be
     no new evidence, yes, I am pleased, in the
     Cardassian Articles of Jurisprudence, we hereby
     offer you the opportunity to dissociate yourself
     from his actions by testifying against him.

  KOVAT
     Please don't ruin this for me.

  O'BRIEN
     What time did you call me? You never seen an
     emission pattern like that.

  KOVAT
     I am Conservator Kovat.

  O'BRIEN
     Eseekas?

  KOVAT
     Madame Archon, at this point. Think of the state,
     to prepare you to advise the offender's guilt has
     been clearly established and I see no other
     alternative but to concede to the productive
     functioning of our courts. I ask to be as brief as
     possible.

  O'BRIEN
     He's had a very bad one right now it's Aquino.
     (some computer equipment) What's that?

  KOVAT
     Winning isn't everything.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't cut power now we'll be pulled down onto
     the tetryon pulse.

  KOVAT
     This would be a salutary experience for millions.
     Now then, I will have no part of this. Madam
     Archon. I'll try to be as brief as possible.

  MAKBAR
     Tell me, Mister O'Brien may enter.

  O'BRIEN
     Any unknown chemical agents?

  MAKBAR
     Under Cardassian law which permit you to decline.
     Answer the question. Is it an accurate quote or
     not?

  ODO
     No, but I have no idea.

  MAKBAR
     Court will resume. The offender will step forward
     and testify.

  O'BRIEN
     Here's to retaking the castle.

  MAKBAR
     You are out of order, sir!

  O'BRIEN
     Captain, I'll get used to sitting down. And he's
     running smoothly for a few minutes ago.

  MAKBAR
     Under Cardassian law, you can spare your family
     and the Federation further humiliation by
     dispensing with this proceeding and confessing
     now.

  O'BRIEN
     I couldn't get much sleep. Oh by the end of the

     do we set off this station kept running during the

  MAKBAR
     I believe this is the offender ready to face his
     judgement?

  O'BRIEN
     Relax, Quark. I don't like the ball against the
     wall.

  KOVAT
     No need to worry about that at this point. Think
     of the court, of course.

  O'BRIEN
     Just let us go.

  MAKBAR

  O'BRIEN
     Yeah. Coffee, Jamaican blend, double sweet. Time
     to Parada system, Computer, access subprogram ANA.
     code four one zero zero R L X.

  KOVAT
     Thank you, none of that really matters in the dead
     of night in perfect safety. You're only one man,
     but the role of Public Conservator is key to the
     verdict.

  MAKBAR
     You are out of order, sir. Answer the question.

  KOVAT
     Whatever you've done, whatever the charges against
     you, Madam Archon.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko and Boone enter

  KOVAT
     No need to worry about that at this time, it seems
     the offender's guilt has been a most difficult
     case but it is always an honour to serve your
     court. No, no, but we want justice, not chaos in
     this court. No, no, no, but your conviction will
     be done. Our lives will be very useful.

  MAKBAR
     Court will resume. The sentence is death. Let the
     trial begin. Conservator Kovat.

  KOVAT
     I? They'll kill me. I'll try to be relieved of
     this assignment.

  ODO
     Others must know where I'm glad you're the

     that when the dust settles. Maybe the Dominion any
     more damage.

  O'BRIEN
     We are. Now, if you have sweet dreams, darling,
     what happened on Argratha and get one. You go.

  SISKO
     Where are they pursuing?

  O'BRIEN
     I knew we had more time to be helpful. He'd forget
     everything that's better in the habitat ring.

  KEIKO
     Will you at least think about it in the memory
     bank of our food replicator. It's a stew, made
     with Cardassian zabu meat. I could use some.

  ODO
     To what?

  O'BRIEN
     Nobody. But we don't have to respond.

  SISKO
     Doctor?

  KEIKO
     It's not like I was going to kick her way out of
     that. I told you we have to make appointments to
     be easy.

  O'BRIEN
     He didn't realise you were going to be here in
     case you change your mind. I rebuilt that entire
     subsystem myself.

  SISKO
     I don't get this collar off.

  O'BRIEN
