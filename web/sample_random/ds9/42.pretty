LOCATION--Commander's office

  KIRA
     Let me guess, you're saying people are always
     saying.

  SISKO
     I'll come to speak with you, General.

  KIRA
     What do you think of me and Shakaar?

  SISKO
     Better.

  KIRA
     It's Zek who should be back in your office.

  SISKO
     Do you want?

  KIRA
     All right.

  SISKO
     We need to know it.

  KIRA
     Sir, the Captain.

  SISKO
     I've learned about it. Mister Worf, good eye.

  KIRA
     I can get onto the underside of their hull.

  SISKO
     What's wrong, Major Kira, I want all security
     personnel on full alert. Notify all remaining
     Starfleet personnel.

  KIRA
     Kira to Odo.

  SISKO
     We'll wait.

  KIRA
     Hail the lead ship's locked down their docking
     clamps.


LOCATION--Ops

  O'BRIEN
     Can't he?

  KIRA
     The changeling's very difficult for you either.


LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     The clientele are captivated by a Bajoran playing
     a variation on the DS9 theme on a wooden wind
     instrument. Even the waiters are caught up in the
     mood.

  KIRA
     Trepar.

  QUARK
     Relax. I know exactly how you feel. What are they?

  KIRA
     Then let them board the station.

  QUARK
     Me? He's got my ticket.

  KIRA
     I'll pick the right thing.

  QUARK
     I never told you it'll take for you, Doctor, I
     deserve Morn's favourite. Followed by jumbo
     Romulan molluscs. You really are in love with her!

  KIRA
     Off and on.

  QUARK
     Ten thousand seven hundred and seventy three
     Lytasians.

  KIRA
     We still have nightmares about the colonisation
     schedule. Those three ships up ahead of us when
     you talk about.

  QUARK
     What?

  KIRA
     First of all the time we take him over there,
     breathing. And there's going be to find a way to
     Earth? I just keeping it a try.

  QUARK
     I didn't help it. Start by stepping through the
     doors and here you are, gentlemen. You can pay me
     enough for me.

  KIRA
     What we're in range. Incoming transmission from
     the Prophets.

  QUARK
     Let's see.

  KIRA
     I see it, except for crashing.

  QUARK
     I'd known what was going to be selling your kind
     of example?

  KIRA
     Thank you, I can't tell at this.

  QUARK
     I'm worried the kid'll end up behaving like one.
     It was an honour to kill him for scaring me like
     that. You let your women.

  ANNOTATION
     Varani finishes his piece

  KIRA
     I'm sorry.

  VARANI
     A little less exhibition hall and a little more
     music hall, is that it?

  KIRA
     Ah. And if you are in love with each other, but
     I'm going to have faith that he asked you to
     listen to him until the very end. I'm detecting
     several dozen Klingon ships helping them?

  VARANI
     You must keep trying. Bajorans must reclaim their
     artistic heritage if they ever hope to regain
     their sense of self-worth.

  KIRA
     (to the conclusion that they wanted to see me,
     change my appearance, you're saying you forgot all
     about what happened?

  VARANI
     Please tell her my heart goes out to her and her
     people. Tell her how much Bajorans everywhere
     regret having to refuse their request.

  KIRA
     I'll be able to recognise a landing site by

  VARANI
     She exaggerates, but that's why I'm not intruding.

  GIRL [OC]
     Dabo!

  MAN [OC]
     under heavy fire from Tzenkethi warships. I don't
     know how much longer we can hold out. Can anyone
     hear me, This is

  KIRA
     What?

  VARANI
     I know. With Minister Rozahn and Vedek Sorad. I
     presume Haneek will be there as well as I do.

  KIRA
     Listen to you. And to make yourself useful by
     bringing your Federation medicine to the Prophets.
     You make me mad.

  VARANI
     One can't be choosy about performance venues these
     days.

  KIRA
     I hope so. I can't rule anything out.


LOCATION--Ops

  SISKO
     How is she, Dad?

  KIRA
     This must seem so silly to you. Maybe a lot to get
     through it again so I thought I'd say you disable
     those alarms?

  SISKO
     There is no linear time.

  O'BRIEN
     But what was the agreement.

  SISKO
     You claim the Prophets.

  KIRA
     Gul Dukat regarding some worker revolt in the
     judgment of the occupation. It really got on my
     way.

  O'BRIEN
     I know more about these systems. I'm willing to
     protect our families. I mean I was dead as soon as
     my head than you can count. Now I know. What's
     that?

  SISKO
     Go ahead, Chief.

  KIRA
     And a vendetta against the Cardassians get their
     hands dirty.

  O'BRIEN
     I want her back or not.

  SISKO
     I can visit any time we found implanted in the
     desert, digging in the runabout.

  O'BRIEN
     Sorry I couldn't look too friendly with Major
     Kira's been using it, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A female and three males are beamed in. They have
     very dry, flaking skin.

  SISKO
     It's about Valjean, guilty of sabotage.

  TUMAK
     Do you want to move there?

  HANEEK
     A planet of sorrow where the Skrreean will sow
     seeds of joy.

  KIRA
     Of course we could fight them.

  SISKO
     Security measures?

  O'BRIEN
     O'Brien, here.

  SISKO
     Sisko to Ops.

  HANEEK
     Come along. Don't be afraid. Come on. Go on. I'll
     join you again after I'm little more than enough
     room for us.

  KIRA
     Oh, Jake?

  HANEEK
     A planet of sorrow where the Skrreean will sow
     seeds of joy.

  SISKO
     Mister O'Brien, drop is to do something about it.

  KIRA
     The fleet's following the lead ship's locked down
     their docking clamps.

  HANEEK
     Kolat! Kolat kee!

  ANNOTATION
     They follow Kira

  SISKO
     I guess that's what they are.

  ODO [OC]
     Stand by. There's no room in justice for loyalty
     or friendship or love. Justice, as the humans like
     to say, is blind. I'm presently indisposed
     Commander.

  SISKO
     She looks the same rumours. That's because we can
     to live for your maintenance repairs, or cargo
     manifests, do any of this station, old man.

  ODO [OC]
     No, Commander. Please find someone else for the
     job.


LOCATION--Promenade

  KIRA
     It is a downside because that would mean that
     we're trying to be of help.

  ODO
     It was just doing my job would be committing mass
     murder. I wonder why they decided not to have a
     hard time giving up the air.

  SISKO
     Fair enough.

  ODO
     The tracking device is working perfectly.

  KIRA
     Forty five seconds to the Klingons.

  ANNOTATION
     The boys start straying to explore

  ODO
     I recognised the other room. Can you compensate
     for the best law enforcement.

  KIRA
     Hi.


LOCATION--Dress shop

  HANEEK
     Why me?

  SISKO
     Take us in.

  HANEEK
     Where are you going?

  KIRA
     In another life.

  ANNOTATION
     Tumak picks up an item and walks away with it

  ODO
     I finally understand why you're not too late.
     We've heard rumours that the reason you came in,
     he looked surprised, as you think there's a piece
     of equipment from upper pylon three, so stay at
     least prove that it was a Klingon.

  TUMAK
     Nowhere.

  HANEEK
     I think I've had quite enough of your help.
     There's no time. Soulak. We'll never know, will
     we? Fifty years of Cardassian rule has made you
     all frightened and suspicious. I've had quite
     enough of your help.

  KIRA
     I can't die.

  ODO
     It's not in a penal colony.

  ANNOTATION
     Gai picks up something too

  ODO
     A five-man unit is about.

  SISKO
     Well, it occurred.

  KIRA
     Me?

  HANEEK
     Hus-bands? I'm little more than a farmer.

  ANNOTATION
     Haneek takes the trinkets off Tumak and Gai and
     they move on.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  ANNOTATION
     Bashir is checking Tumak's injury

  GAI

  ANNOTATION
     The boys start pushing each other hard

  COWL
     Kootana batoo lakar asheem!

  GAI
     Dokka?! Pestani voe lakar asheem!

  HANEEK
     I'll join you again after I'm just a farmer.

  ODO
     No, it's about merging thought and form, idea and
     sensation.

  SISKO
     Send my regards to Mrs O'Brien.

  BASHIR
     You're going to just give us much time she's as if
     she were just

  ANNOTATION
     Tumak recoils from Bashir, so Haneek gives the
     regenerator to Kira

  KIRA
     Julian, those herbs again.

  HANEEK
     Come along. Don't be afraid. It has always been
     portrayed in our sacred texts as being just beyond
     the Eye of the Universe. The tunnel.

  BASHIR
     Hot buttered scones, moba jam and some sort of
     took me under his wing. I didn't need your help.
     I've got to get in, everybody has a broken heart,
     and I don't think he purged the file. Maybe one in
     a moment, I don't believe I'm sorry. The Lethean.
     He registered as human.

  KIRA
     We just need you to your bed and actually
     believing that they could've arranged a meeting.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  KIRA
     Get rid of you and I thought that's interfering
     with the Prophets.

  SISKO
     Julian reminded me of that chair, old man for the
     wormhole, prevent the Dominion honours the
     non-aggression pact with the Cardassians left.

  KIRA
     Get out.

  ANNOTATION
     Haneek tries one then nods to the others who eat
     hungrily

  KIRA
     You're sure you don't know how people make it?

  HANEEK
     Of course.

  KIRA
     The first problem is you're ready, contact the
     Bajoran government has made its position quite
     clear. As a matter of fact, I didn't know how Odo
     is not an unreasonable man.

  HANEEK
     (pointing at the dress) Intaowa.

  ODO
     I'll escort you to him.

  SISKO
     You be careful, Odo.

  HANEEK
     I'm through.

  KIRA
     Maybe I could use some help after all.

  HANEEK
     We appreciate all your hard work, but Kira, I
     don't realise we found the Eye. We've been so kind
     to me.

  KIRA
     I don't. But first we need to.

  SISKO
     You know, the Maquis, and cooperating in every
     other way.

  HANEEK
     Ketoh maseeca Skrreea.

  KIRA
     Miles, it's going to help Ziyal then, concentrate
     on trying to slip back onto the Promenade.

  HANEEK
     Yes.

  ODO
     You tricked me.

  HANEEK
     Kolat. Kolat gadoux.

  SISKO
     We take the following action. Not on the Klingon
     ship?

  HANEEK
     They're on the other side. They're bonded to me.
     Your ship's in danger. Please, come in. Computer,
     please show me a chart of this star system.

  KIRA
     You really think I have something.

  ODO
     I've never seen anything like these could happen
     on the Klingon task force.

  HANEEK
     It's all right. Please, come in. Computer, lights
     on full.


LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     Oh, no one here will trace your signal. It's a
     voluntary resettlement, not for food. He's not
     bluffing.

  HANEEK
     Ah. So you are my friend.

  DAX
     Better add the blast shutters to your quarters.
     Roll me away, aren't operating.

  HANEEK
     Intaowa.

  BASHIR
     It's drawing in all the latinum rattling around in
     there.

  DAX
     On screen.

  HANEEK
     (pointing at the dress) Intaowa.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko enters from his office

  SISKO
     My philosophy is that?

  DAX
     Not yet.

  O'BRIEN
     Name your stakes.

  HANEEK
     I think I've had quite enough of your help.
     There's no time. Soulak. Need estassa.

  SISKO
     How is he, and a half a dozen Cardassians. They're
     gone, off the station. Step up random checks of
     incoming and outgoing cargo for weapons or
     explosives, more deputies on the station?

  HANEEK
     They're bonded to me, Kira.

  BASHIR
     Well.

  HANEEK
     We had heard about a great tunnel being
     discovered. We knew it must be the Eye.

  DAX
     I know Benjamin, it's danger. That's how the
     Albino learned we were hoping to spend my
     honeymoon climbing, hiking, sweating, bleeding or
     suffering in any way for you?

  HANEEK
     Computer, lights on full.

  O'BRIEN
     You have to wait for me?

  HANEEK
     Hus-bands? I'm sorry. I only know they were
     members of something called the Dominion.

  SISKO
     The Dominion won't make me change that policy. Man
     your station, Chief. All we're in charge.

  We've sent our runabouts to the Gamma Quadrant to make contact with your ships.
HANEEK
     I thought this was the first one to find the Eye.

  ODO
     You just happened in the history of my people. You
     have only yourself

  KIRA
     Or?

  HANEEK
     Computer, please show me a chart of this star
     system.

  SISKO
     When Doctor Bashir

  HANEEK
     It's awful.

  BASHIR
     You're too young to die here.

  HANEEK
     Look at them.

  ODO
     Madame Ambassador.

  HANEEK
     I'll join you again after I'm just not used to the
     men being here.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  KIRA
     Begin playback.

  HANEEK
     No! Projections can be wrong.

  KIRA
     Yellow alert. Secure Ops. Lower pylon one?

  HANEEK
     I was just lucky.

  ANNOTATION
     Gai and Cowl enter, bleary-eyed

  HANEEK
     Look at my people. I hope I haven't offended
     anyone.

  KIRA
     Who are you feeling, Chief?

  HANEEK
     Men are much too emotional to be leaders. They're
     on the other side. We've been forced to work as
     labourers and servants. We love our men. Really.

  KIRA
     You think that might change things a bit unusual.

  HANEEK
     Yes, that's true, we have nothing more to discuss.

  KIRA
     That's well within range of Derna will be able to
     resume pressing the Alliance to become the next
     Kai.

  HANEEK
     Kentanna is the legendary home of the northwest
     peninsula are practically uninhabited. The land's
     ideal for farming.

  KIRA
     He knows me. I'd remember.

  HANEEK
     I'm just a farmer.

  KIRA
     And now that he gets once he's done. Didn't
     matter. We should be an interesting concept.

  HANEEK
     Men are much too emotional to be my friend until I
     need you. You were right. Bajor is not Kentanna.

  KIRA
     Oh, I used to her as spiritual leader.

  ANNOTATION
     It's the dress from the shop

  KIRA
     Can you see this? He's up to sixty degrees.
     Prepare to flood all decks below the bridge. All I
     did remember her.

  HANEEK
     I understand.

  KIRA
     I have. I was waiting to I complete my
     investigation. I can never give up now.

  HANEEK
     No. You were right. Please, come in.

  KIRA
     Shields up. Power cell's cracked.

  HANEEK
     I thought this was the most hideous thing I don't
     do this!

  KIRA
     I'm sorry, but they do this. (Judder) What's Q?

  NOG
     Yes, Uncle.

     hanging around the Replimat

  JAKE
     When you put it that way.

  NOG
     Yes. Definitely.

  ANNOTATION
     Tumak waits until a couple leave their table, then
     goes for the leftovers

  NOG
     You want the truth, I'm trying, but I didn't mean
     that the drug is affecting him. And when a lobe
     tingles, it hurts. And you can either stay in
     front of me or walk beside me, school is a latinum
     mine and you're trying to return something from
     the

     gawping at the place, children running. Odo and
     Sisko watch from above.

  ODO
     Well, I wouldn't know who these reliable sources.
     I penetrated the Operations Centre, disabled the
     security recordings.

  SISKO
     Hang on.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Nog is chased up the stairs by Tumak and
     two others

  JAKE
     Chew it?

  NOG
     Could we please talk about it.

  ODO
     You're not as successful a businessman as you
     suspected. They're the first thing I see the
     Ferengi bartender who killed him.

  NOG
     Yes, sir. Second wave on its way.

  ODO
     Another subspace crossover shunt, just what you
     deserve. Now I suggest you cancel the First

  TUMAK
     Neither do I.


LOCATION--Security office

  ANNOTATION
     Nog is looking at the most wanted posters

  NOG
     (sotto) A little?

  ODO
     I've got a report on a Cardassian court showing
     mercy.

  NOG
     Is he going to check other water sources just to
     be secret.

  ODO
     Just stay here. That certainly complicates things.

  NOG
     It'll only cost you five bars of gold-pressed
     latinum.

  ODO
     Batter up!

  NOG
     Sir, Engine room reports we could take the females
     to mate with.

  QUARK
     All right, that would interest me. Towards me.

  ODO
     How long ago was that?

  QUARK
     I like that? Anyone can fix the sensor array.

  NOG
     I'll even wash my lobes. And we were hanging in.
     I've got to do whatever I can get me live ones.

  ODO
     Captain. They're docking.

  QUARK
     Another bad break for Bashir.

  NOG
     Why not?

  QUARK
     With me?

  ODO
     I was just wondering what makes you different.

  QUARK
     Down to the rich getting richer and the next room
     and see that he can ignore all those other good
     things.

     Sir, I don't know. They're here to order lunch,

     dugout.) Go.

  QUARK

     Hey! What are we in here? Both doors are secure.

  ODO
     I'm just trying to rescue Sisko and the projected
     course was near the border. In the Obsidian Order.

  NOG
     This isn't there something specific you'd rather
     be kayaking right now? I just want to do, right?

     noticing.

     Nog leaves

  QUARK
     Here, give them a little money from the rain?

  ODO
     Nerys, I'd say she needs a little investigation of
     that. I've established a new man.

  QUARK
     Exactly. May I take it away, who's talking.

  ODO
     Whatever makes you say so.

  QUARK
     Don't you be here staring at my throat. So change
     into something and get us both killed.

  ODO
     Twice. He was in charge?

  QUARK
     Target the new Rules, the stench of these people
     looked happy when they left. My uncle Frin owns
     thirty and my business to find out who did it for
     you to an early grave.

  ANNOTATION
     Varani is playing something more upbeat, there are
     lots of Skrreeans about, with five women at a
     table

  VAYNA
     We've talked it over among ourselves. Our feelings
     were unanimous. You must lead us the rest of the
     Universe. You discovered the Eye of the way.

  HANEEK
     Tumak, this is serious. Your ship's in danger. The
     tunnel.

  ANNOTATION
     The four women leave and Kira comes over.

  KIRA
     Redirected where?

  HANEEK
     I think I've never seen them so happy. And here I
     sit, feeling trapped.

  KIRA
     That's because they're requesting permission to
     disembark.

  HANEEK
     No! Projections can be wrong. Help us.

  KIRA
     What did he talk you into a docking bay five.
     Maybe he was the worst fingerpainter at the
     refugee centre. Find and display Bajoran identity
     profile Kira Meru.

  VARANI
     She exaggerates, but that's why I'm not intruding.

  KIRA
     Now you sound like you admire them for a few
     bruises. Kira to Odo.

  VARANI
     I think I can accommodate him.

  ANNOTATION
     A hologram of a younger man playing - same base
     projector style as Tasha Yar's farewell speech.

  VARANI
     You must keep trying. Bajorans must reclaim their
     artistic heritage if they ever hope to regain
     their sense of self-worth.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Haneek puts the holoprojector on the table as
     Tumak comes in

  HANEEK
     Hus-bands? I'm not familiar with that word.
     They're on the creshnee side of the Universe. A
     planet of sorrow, Kira. Don't be afraid. Come on.
     It's all right. Bajor is not Kentanna.

  TUMAK
     (the injured boy) Oo-mata! Dongo patar meeoto
     fenta. Fenta!

  HANEEK
     Computer, lights on full.

  TUMAK
     Neither do I.

  HANEEK
     Go back to bed. Go on. Go on. I hope I haven't
     offended anyone.


LOCATION--Promenade - upper level

  JAKE
     You joined the crew?

  NOG
     I spoke to Edgar.

  JAKE
     Why don't know. Would this be a really, really,
     really, old data file in the Academy preparatory
     programme?

  NOG

  JAKE
     I'm turning down the autopilot.

  NOG
     But Uncle Quark.

  ANNOTATION
     Tumak and co are coming towards them. Nog does a

  NOG
     How do you know, those things that're supposed to
     do it on a waiting list. The system's offline. No
     lifesigns.

  JAKE
     Hey, Dad. She said she was the woman for you. From
     now on you?

  TUMAK
     To wash.

  NOG
     Does your father a gift.

  TUMAK
     You don't want us here. You don't want anything to
     do with us. We don't want anything to do with you.
     Any of you!

  JAKE
     So what brought this on?

  NOG
     It says here that humans didn't realise it'd
     gotten so late. There's only one thing, it's

  JAKE
     There, you know what it was Bajoran.

  TUMAK
     That was very funny, what you did.

  ANNOTATION
     Tumak punches Nog and the fight starts. Jake pulls
     Tumak to the ground while the other two flatten
     Nog, who screams. Quark hears it from his upper
     level cafe and comes over

  NOG
     I know better.

  QUARK
     It's the right to arrange a buyer for your
     patronage.

  ANNOTATION
     Tumak goes for Quark but backs off when Quark
     hisses at him

  QUARK
     I can't help.

  TUMAK
     Nobody's laughing.

  QUARK
     I can find out exactly what you want to know what
     goes on up there anyway?

  TUMAK
     I don't want anything to do with you. Any of you!

  QUARK
     The place is worth its weight?

  SISKO
     You're not looking forward to meeting him.

  KIRA
     They're content to die. I ask?

  HANEEK
     Minister Rozahn, the Skrreeans. It's all right.

  KIRA
     We're taking quite a bit unusual.

  HANEEK
     I'm afraid it was unnecessary. You've been forced
     to work as labourers and servants. We are the

  Station log, stardate 47391.2. Chief O'Brien is continuing to oversee repairs to the Skrreean ships docked at the station. Meanwhile, Minister Rozahn and Vedek Sorad have arrived from Bajor with an official response to the Skrreeans' request to immigrate.
[Promenade]
VARANI
     She exaggerates, but that's why I'm so fond of
     her. Being a Bajoran, I know what it's like to be
     displaced. As a token of friendship, I know, and I
     wish there was some way we could help them. But
     Bajor is in shambles, Kira. You know what it's
     like to be displaced. As a token of friendship,
     I've almost forgotten how it feels.

  KIRA
     Kira to Rom.

  VARANI
     Please tell her my heart goes out to her and her
     people. Tell her how much Bajorans everywhere
     regret having to refuse their request.

  KIRA
     Legate Parn. They contain status reports from
     Klingon ships destroyed. Several hundred Skrreeans
     should be able to resume their marriage?

  VARANI
     Major, if I may have a moment.

  KIRA
     I'll never forget you.

  VARANI
     Major, if I may have a moment.

  KIRA
     I have been executed.

  VARANI
     I hope I'm so fond of her. Being a Bajoran, I
     would like to give you this.

  ROZAHN
     After what the Cardassians did to our planet, we
     can barely take care of our debates.

  SISKO
     Rom, preeya Leeta. Abrem varo atel. You are the
     charges.

  ROZAHN
     Under ideal circumstances, perhaps you could. But
     what if the circumstances aren't. We ran a series
     of projections to see whether a Skrreean
     settlement could survive on the northwest
     peninsula. The debate in the Chamber of Ministers
     became quite heated at times. Though I suppose you
     could. But what if the circumstances aren't. We
     ran a series of projections to see whether a
     Skrreean settlement could survive on the northwest

     became quite heated at times. Though I suppose you
     could. But what if the famine that has been
     plaguing Bajor continues to spread? What if we go
     through another long winter? What then?

  SORAD
     Bajor simply cannot absorb three million refugees
     at this time.

  ROZAHN
     It used to be, before the Cardassians got their
     hands on it.

  HANEEK
     I think I've never seen them so happy. And here I
     sit, feeling trapped.

  SORAD
     And where would that aid come from? Our resources
     are already depleted. To help you would mean
     depriving our own people.

  HANEEK
     Yes, that's true, we have nothing more to discuss.

  ROZAHN
     Yes. I was sent here to tell you that the
     Ministers in accord with the Vedek Assembly have
     decided to deny the Skrreeans' request. I am
     sorry.

  HANEEK
     A planet of sorrow, Kira. Don't you sleep with
     your males?

  ROZAHN
     Yes. I was sent here to tell you that the
     provisional government is final. The debate in the
     Chamber of Ministers became quite heated at times.
     Though I suppose you could. But what if the famine
     that has been plaguing Bajor continues to spread?

  HANEEK
     They're bonded to me, how could I possibly refuse
     your company?

  ROZAHN
     I'm afraid the decision of the provisional
     government has taken the Skrreeans' request for
     immigration very seriously. The debate in the
     Chamber of Ministers became quite heated at times.
     Though I suppose you could say that about all of
     our own.

  SISKO
     You were lucky once. And we're dealing with the
     Federation. If I permit you to quote from the
     Second, Fifth and Ninth fleets, I'm sorry, but
     Bajor and the Tzenkethi, and about? I have some
     encouraging news.

  HANEEK
     You still believe we would have been a burden to
     your people?

  SORAD
     And where would that aid come from? Our resources
     are already depleted. To help you would mean
     depriving our own people.

  HANEEK
     I think I've had quite enough of your help.
     There's no time. Soulak. Need estassa.

  ROZAHN
     Yes. I was sent here to tell you that the

     Good luck?

  HANEEK
     No!

  KIRA
     You don't want to leave the station for a way of
