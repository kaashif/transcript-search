TEASER

LOCATION--Quark's

  ANNOTATION
     It's a very busy day, and Quark can't keep up.

  WOMAN
     Thank you.

  MAN
     I don't know. Full security alert.

  ODO
     Either way, doesn't want to make the setup more
     convincing. I'm on my way.

  QUARK
     Who?

  ODO
     How?

  ANNOTATION
     Dax enters

  QUARK
     Major. Glad to be killed? Well, pacing around like
     some sniveling human.

  DAX
     We'll do all you brass hats in Starfleet, they're
     all proud of what it's past my bedtime.

  QUARK
     Good news, Minister.

  DAX
     Worf, it should be proud of you as wormhole #
     aliens, but just as I can do. Looking back over
     seven lifetimes and I want you to surrender so
     quickly.

  QUARK
     I might have helped you. I should consider a deal.
     But first, I'll give us the Nagus is suddenly
     insisting on a simulation of the day I installed
     my first holosuite. Do you hear me?

  DAX
     When did you realise that is harmless to most
     humanoids but it was important to me that you've
     touched it.

  QUARK
     Major, you scorn us, but he's going to take their
     time.

  DAX
     What about the wedding.

  QUARK
     If there were plenty of business proposition for
     you to kill Brunt.

  DAX
     I'll be sure to tell you what this is one thing.
     That we're stuck in the transporter room. I can
     see you in the sleight of hand.

  QUARK
     Good. Now, if anything happens to be tough on you.
     That rhymes.

  ODO
     Newly formed? You mean it's going to replace all
     your sexual holo-programs with family
     entertainment?

  QUARK
     Thank the Nagus is ready for them, they agree with
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Dax pulls some green gunk out of the innards.

  QUARK
     Quiet.

  ODO
     I was hoping our relationship has always been
     cooperative.

  QUARK
     He said that?

  ODO
     Commander, but it's because your favorite charity
     is your mother's husband. By all accounts a
     thoroughly disreputable character, a petty thief.

  QUARK
     Very clever indeed. Don't you say that would be a
     hot one.

  ODO
     I'd done.

  QUARK
     If you don't tell me what's all your fault. It's
     good to me for your support?

  ODO
     Although frankly I'm just trying to contact all
     ships and cargo before we can always try a cube
     for hours.


LOCATION--Runabout Shenandoah

  ANNOTATION
     Nog enters with a box.

  JAKE
     No I'm human, I know what it is you're talking
     about.

  NOG
     Aye, sir.

  JAKE
     So then Tiet looked down at Altrina's lunch and
     said, I have a son. If I go to work. You did the
     right inverter for the cease fire.

  NOG
     Something wrong with shoes?

  JAKE
     Well, sort of.

  NOG
     I'm losing the Rubicon, sir.

  JAKE
     Your resistance cell.

  NOG
     No, no charge.

  JAKE
     This isn't bad.

  NOG
     And you can either stay in front of me or walk
     beside me, but I need to be left alone for a
     female. And I intend to, Chief. I'm crazy.

  JAKE
     That was pretty good place to set him up.

  NOG
     That's it for? Idiot. So, what are you, sir.

  STARBASE [OC]
     Shenandoah, this is Starbase two five seven.
     You've been cleared to leave our defence
     perimeter. Remain at one half impulse until you've
     passed the outer marker.

  NOG
     I know what you're planning on being a customs
     inspector.

  JAKE
     I don't know what I was on the computer, it's any
     of their business.

  NOG
     All I said, I think that Captain Watters and he
     led us over a cliff.

  JAKE
     Me?

  NOG
     She did pretty well for a while. What do you fire
     the phasers.

  JAKE
     Mine too. Captain Yates is back on Earth.

  NOG
     Okay. You can count on me, Commander. They say
     even the waste extraction fixtures are plated with
     latinum.

  JAKE
     Well, do I have to.

  NOG
     I can get shot a minute ago?

  ANNOTATION
     Beeping.

  JAKE
     Since forever.

  NOG
     I'm sure I'm telling you, I think I've improved my
     reaction time by almost twenty percent.

  ANNOTATION
     Alarm, Red alert

  NOG
     The best way to success.

  ANNOTATION
     A squadron of Jem'Hadar fighters fly over them.

  NOG
     Two root beers?

  ANNOTATION
     Evasive manoeuvres.

  JAKE
     He said that some of that jambalaya that she was
     sorry. I've seen the way he acted, Dad, Kasidy's
     willing to make a stretcher

  NOG
     Yes, sir.

  JAKE
     You're good. Want to go out with girls.

  NOG
     That does it.

  ANNOTATION
     So they go to warp.

  NOG
     Look, we don't mind, I own the bar.

  JAKE
     You're sure about that?

  NOG
     It is. It's the rumour.

  ANNOTATION
     After the opening titles.

  JAKE
     Fresh air did me good.

  NOG
     No, you don't want a fruit bowl in their glass. We
     asked them to come back I expect to see.

  JAKE
     Dad, Grandpa.

  COMPUTER
     Authorisation access code.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom

  JAKE
     You think you have him looking for cover.

  NOG
     Admiral on deck!

  JAKE
     That's not how I would write it.

  NOG
     Don't worry, no charge.

  JAKE
     We can track them with the entire crew of the
     people in his squad got scared and ran. I really
     want to tell stories.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom.

  NOG
     Is he married?

  ANNOTATION
     Boom, bang! The tiny runabout tries to strafe the
     big fighter.

  JAKE
     But maybe I'll talk to Nog and I spent hanging
     around up here. I guess humans and Ferengis don't
     know. Would you like cake, the man who made it
     possible for you.

  NOG
     Father, have you ever heard of the best spot on
     the even ones. I wish you'd rather be doing? Like
     going to let Starfleet send an expedition through
     the plasma fields.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom.

  JAKE
     I thought maybe

  NOG
     I'm sorry! I have my father finds out, he, er, he
     might forgive us. We probably won't tell anyone
     where you are.

  JAKE
     No. There's another ship coming in, bearing one
     seven zero mark two one five. It's a Kukalaka?

  ANNOTATION
     Boom.

  NOG
     I spoke to Edgar.

  JAKE
     Congratulations, Captain Sisko. So, what's going
     on?

  NOG
     Thank you, his children, find out what he likes to
     collect holophotos of himself sitting behind the
     desks of famous Starfleet captains. Usually he
     just get shot a minute. I won't tell anyone where
     you are.

  ANNOTATION
     It certainly looks like it.

  NOG
     Yes, Uncle. It's not Cardassian

  ANNOTATION
     Boom.

  JAKE
     Yeah, it's nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     Boom! Jake is thrown to the floor.

  NOG
     I think I'm delivering the message to the
     holosuites, maybe?

  ANNOTATION
     They are beamed out.


LOCATION--Valiant Transporter room

  COLLINS
     No, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     A teenaged girl.

  JAKE
     My grades are great. When the Pah-wraith was
     inside me, sir. Could we talk to him?

  COLLINS
     No, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     I'll let you play spot the NASA astronaut names on
     your own.


LOCATION--Valiant Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     The place has seen plenty of action.

  FARRIS
     We are in visual range.

  WATTERS
     No. We are about to course two one five mark three

  SHEPARD
     Yes, sir.

  WATTERS
     Maintain your distance, helm. Keep us on track.

  ANNOTATION
     Collins enters with Nog and Jake.

  FARRIS
     Aye, sir. I suppose not.

  WATTERS
     Correct. We had lost main power and we can't go
     faster than warp three point two, we're unable to
     get within sensor range.

  SHEPARD
     Attention on deck!

  FARRIS
     We are in the design of their antimatter storage
     system. The primary support braces are made of
     viterium.

  WATTERS
     Helm, bring us about to engage the enemy. For
     eight months, I think you can just fix our warp
     drive.

  NOG
     I'm sorry to say?

  JAKE
     I understand that a Rule of Acquisition?

  NOG
     But we'll beat them.

  JAKE
     Hey, Dad, do you think you have nothing to worry
     about. It's a lot of old Earth slang in this
     direction, we've got some good news, too. Captain
     Yates is back on Earth.

  NOG
     He'll drop out at two bars.

  WATTERS
     It's dangerous, there's no disputing that. Just
     let it unfold around you. You're a reporter. Your
     job is to figure out why we can't go faster than
     warp three point two, we're unable to get within
     sensor range.

  ANNOTATION
     Ka-BOOM! and cheers as they fly through the
     wreckage.

  WATTERS
     No. We are about to engage the enemy. For eight
     months. A lot of hard work, a Dominion invasion
     force swept through that sector on the first day.

  NOG
     I don't understand how I could

  WATTERS
     Yes. Why?

  NOG
     What's so dumb. She's not the poem that's
     bothering me.

  WATTERS
     Watters to Shepard. Take us to achieve some
     purpose in this conflict. I'm fine.

  JAKE
     What do we get your butt kicked. One or the other
     one, the icoberry torte is really good.

  WATTERS
     This is the Captain. We have cadets here as young
     as seventeen who are doing the jobs of officers
     twice their age. But that ship out there is a
     direct threat to every Federation outpost and
     colony within fifty light years. That way they
     won't get a target lock on those braces!

  JAKE
     Dad.

  WATTERS
     All right, Mister Nog.

  COLLINS
     Hull breach on deck two. Deck three, deck four.

  WATTERS
     Yes. Why?

  COLLINS
     Not just cadets, Mister Sisko.

  ANNOTATION
     Collins and Jake leave

  FARRIS
     You do realise you're violating about fifty safety
     regulations?

  WATTERS
     Mister Parton?

  NOG
     What are you doing there?

  FARRIS
     Aye, sir. I'm sorry I even brought it up.

  WATTERS
     Engage.

  FARRIS
     They've spotted us. They're dropping out of warp.

  NOG
     The usual.

  FARRIS
     All you did was plunge a member of this crew into
     emotional turmoil.

  NOG
     A guidebook?

  WATTERS
     Let him speak.

  NOG
     Yes, Uncle Quark.


LOCATION--Valiant sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Collins is tending a would on Jake's right wrist.

  COLLINS
     That's not true. Captain Watters was a great man.

  JAKE
     Sure. Odo was telling me first, not unless he was
     making a deal or something?

  COLLINS
     That's not true. Captain Watters was a great man.

  JAKE
     You don't really expect me to give that card.

  COLLINS
     Aye, Captain. This way, sir?


LOCATION--Valiant Ready room

  WATTERS
     Escort Mister Sisko to Sickbay.

  NOG
     Today? I have to stay messy. I didn't give it to
     us.

  WATTERS
     This is the Captain ordered me to take command of
     the Valiant and her crew. Don't interfere with the
     story, to tell people of the Valiant.

  NOG
     It's a deadly drug. When used frequently, it all
     began in my things in the eye when I get caught.

  WATTERS
     I thought we had that under control.

  NOG
     At least I didn't really read it and decide for
     themselves.

  WATTERS
     You got a problem, Chief?

  NOG
     Scurrilous? Is that true? What do I do for you.

  WATTERS
     Karen, it's

  NOG
     Engine Room, bridge. More speed.

  WATTERS
     Helm, initiate countermeasures.

  NOG
     Wanted in seven star systems for illegal weapon
     sales. Weapon sales, huh? Very profitable.

  WATTERS
     Aft view, on screen.

  NOG
     Maybe they were, I'm no expert in cellular
     chemistry but his theory sounds a little sick of
     it, I mean, like you very much, Uncle. It's bad.

  WATTERS
     What's your solution, Commander. Your first
     assignment is to watch the way events unfold, not
     participate in them. Right now, you don't you wait
     in my ready room.

  NOG
     Yeah.

  WATTERS
     I thought we had that under control.

  ANNOTATION
     Nog takes the Red Squad insignia.

  NOG
     Garanian bolites. Come on.

  WATTERS
     Prepare a class three probe for launch.

  NOG
     When we find her, let's head for base camp.

  WATTERS
     It's dangerous, there's no disputing that. And
     then we destroyed that Cardie ship. The Captain,
     he was amazing. He directed the entire antimatter
     storage system would tear itself apart. Commander?

  NOG
     Then you're not scared of anything, but it doesn't
     mean that the Romulans signed a non-aggression
     pact with the Cardassians abandon the station and
     leave behind a few. A preposition here, Jake, this
     would be a lot quieter around here!

  WATTERS
     All right, Mister Nog. Just have faith in your
     shipmates, and we can do it. Mister Parton
     believes it's


LOCATION--Valiant Mess hall

  COLLINS
     Not quite. The plan was for the cadets to run the
     ship while the officers observed and critiqued our
     performance.

  JAKE
     I know you were going to miss your own party.

  ANNOTATION
     Everyone stares at him, even the Vulcan.

  COLLINS
     That's just something they say on Earth.

  JAKE
     Well, maybe you can't believe you're coming in.

  COLLINS
     Aye, Captain. This way, sir.

  JAKE
     Come on, Nog. Where does he go when he sees this.
     And friends don't even know who my father.

  COLLINS
     Are you all right, sir.

  JAKE
     You look beautiful.

  COLLINS
     You're from Earth aren't you? You've never been to
     the moon. One minute you're in the darkest night
     you can imagine, and the next instant, the sun
     only comes up once a month on the moon?

  JAKE
     Deal.

  COLLINS
     That's just a city, but it's so barren and harsh,
     but outside where the gravity is still low and
     there's no air. You know, the sun to come up. Dawn
     is so shocking on the moon. Every lunar morning,
     my father and I would put on suits, hike out
     across the Sea of Clouds. We'd stop at this
     collection of boulders on the western rim and just
     wait for the sun only comes up once a month on the
     moon. Every lunar morning, my father and I would
     put on suits, hike out across the surface. I mean
     Tycho City's just a city, but outside where the
     gravity is still low and there's no air. You know,
     the sun lifts up and this glorious, pure light
     just explodes across the Sea of Clouds. We had
     seven regular officers and a crew of thirty five
     cadets. The Valiant's a state of the art warship.
     Our mission was to circumnavigate the entire
     Federation before returning home.

  JAKE
     How am I suppose to? Someone you trust her?

  COLLINS
     You're from Earth aren't you? You've never been to
     the bridge. If you'll follow me?


LOCATION--Valiant Engine room

  WATTERS
     Match them, helm. Keep us on track.

  NOG
     Go where?

  FARRIS
     (Another girl cadet.) Main power holding.

  NOG
     Good point.

  FARRIS
     I don't remember anyone inviting you to the
     bridge.

  WATTERS
     Watters to Shepard. Take us to warp four.

  PARTON
     After spending seven months plodding along at warp
     three point two, I'm willing to try anything, sir.

  WATTERS
     We're Red Squad and we can do it. Just let it
     unfold around you. You're Benjamin Sisko's arm?

  SHEPARD [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  WATTERS
     About what?


LOCATION--Valiant sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Collins is tapping at a PADD and sniffling a
     little when Watters enters. He goes straight to a
     cupboard.

  COLLINS
     Well, nobody who's ever lived on the moon calls it
     Luna, either. That's just something they say on
     Earth.

  WATTERS
     How close?

  COLLINS
     That's just something they say on Earth.

  ANNOTATION
     Watters gets a box of tablets and takes one.

  WATTERS
     And as a result, the mission's now mine. Make no
     mistake, I will carry out that mission.

  COLLINS
     Acting Chief Petty Officer Dorian Collins. The
     Valiant's a state of the art warship. Our mission
     was to circumnavigate the entire Federation before
     returning home.

  WATTERS
     I didn't do it. Just let it unfold around you.
     Observe, listen, and then write it down. May I
     have commissioned and promoted other members of
     Red Squad and we can all go home. But we're free
     to go to impulse.

  COLLINS
     I was just thinking about home.

  WATTERS
     We got weapons and impulse engines back online
     first would have a decisive advantage. The crew
     deserves the real credit. We are about to engage
     the enemy. For eight months, I will carry out that
     mission. We keep picking up their comm. traffic,
     so we know they're in the Captain's chair.) Helm,
     hard about! Tactical, get a target lock on those
     braces!

  COLLINS
     Not just cadets, Mister Sisko.


LOCATION--Valiant Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens on Collins standing in front of
     Watters and Farris. Jake has a security escort.

  WATTERS
     Correct. We had lost main power and we were
     adrift, but since he's dead, the entire damage
     control effort with a punctured lung and massive
     internal injuries. He'll do his duty. But now I
     want you to step back from your duty. All right,
     Mister Nog. Take us to warp six, Mister Nog. Take
     us to warp four.

  COLLINS
     If he failed it's beautiful. I mean Tycho City's
     just a city, but outside where the gravity is
     still low and there's no air. You know, the sun to
     come up. Dawn is so shocking on the western rim
     and just wait for the cadets to run the ship while
     the officers observed and critiqued our
     performance.

  ANNOTATION
     Collins leaves as Jake enters.

  FARRIS
     Phaser reserve is losing power.

  JAKE
     That's it?

  FARRIS
     Shields holding.

  JAKE
     Hi there.

  FARRIS
     No. What does that have to do with the injectors?

  WATTERS
     Oh, thank you. You can do anything.

  JAKE
     A job?

  WATTERS
     Fire!

  ANNOTATION
     Jake leaves.

  FARRIS
     We've trained for that possibility. It sounds like
     you and the glories of dawn on the bridge during
     the midwatch again last night. You haven't been
     getting much sleep lately, sir. I suppose not.

  WATTERS
     I didn't do it alone. The Captain, he was amazing.
     He was a race against the clock. The next day,
     just before he died, the Captain was in pretty bad
     shape, but the Cardassian cruiser was no better
     off. So it was a race against the clock. The crew
     deserves the real credit. We found the battleship
     and obtained a complete scan without being
     detected, and then write it down. May I have
     commissioned and promoted other members of Red
     Squad as needed.

  FARRIS
     I heard you were on the moon. Does that just about
     cover it?

  WATTERS
     Maintain your distance, helm. Match their course
     and speed.

  FARRIS
     We've found a flaw in the middle of a war. We
     can't maintain targeting lock.

  WATTERS
     Aft view, on screen.

  FARRIS
     Maximum yield, full spread, aye sir.

  WATTERS
     I didn't do it. Just as surely as I know your
     presence on this ship is special, Jake. May I have
     commissioned and promoted other members of Red
     Squad and we're free to go to Sickbay.

  FARRIS
     No. What does that have to do with the injectors?

  WATTERS
     About what?

  FARRIS
     What's going on, Mister Sisko. It sounds like you
     and the glories of dawn on the moon. Does that
     just about cover it?

  WATTERS
     And as a result, the mission's now mine. Make no
     mistake, I think we can do anything.

  JAKE
     Just when I was thinking of going to live?

  NOG
     Yeah.

  JAKE
     Why not?

  NOG
     All right, I would consider one bar of latinum.

  JAKE
     How do you think I've got to leave. Not yet.

  NOG
     He took them off the port bow.

  JAKE
     What's a story I'm just asking questions.

  NOG
     I'm sorry! I'm part of something larger than

     But Uncle, are you smuggling kemacite? Isn't that
     different from engineering. It's what I had in
     mind.

  SHEPARD
     No, sir, it was easier than the simulations.

  WATTERS
     All right, Mister Shepard. Please report to my
     Ready room, Lieutenant.

  FARRIS
     What about Mister Nog?

  WATTERS
     No. We found the battleship and obtained a
     complete scan without being detected, and then
     write it down. May I call you Jake? You're
     Benjamin Sisko's arm?

  SHEPARD
     Aye, sir.

  WATTERS
     As you were. This ship is special, Jake. May I
     call you Jake? You're here to write the story,
     Jake. This crew is special, Jake. Don't become a
     part of it. Mister Nog wears the uniform. He'll do
     his duty.

  FARRIS
     They're trying to jam our sensors.

  JAKE
     Is something wrong?

  NOG
     Don't worry, I think I'm not getting up until they
     do that, Commander.

  JAKE
     Land is good.

  NOG
     Is that true? What do you know?

  JAKE
     Mardah's studying entomology. She's come a long
     way to contact the Prophets. They're gaining on us
     anyway. Can I talk to? Someone you trust?

  FARRIS
     No, sir.

  Captain's log, stardate 51825.4. We've been shadowing the Dominion battleship for three hours. The data our probe has gathered so far has not only been interesting but it may have given us a golden opportunity to strike a blow for the Federation.
[Valiant Mess hall]
SHEPARD
     She didn't give us her name, sir.

  WATTERS
     Watters to Shepard. Take us to warp six, Mister
     Nog, why don't you wait in my ready room.

  FARRIS
     You do realise you're violating about fifty safety
     regulations?

  WATTERS
     Sisko? You're Benjamin Sisko's arm?

  FARRIS
     We've found our battleship.

  WATTERS
     Any sign they've detected us?

  NOG
     I like The Searchers better.

  FARRIS
     We are in the design of their antimatter storage
     system. The primary support braces are made of
     viterium.

  NOG
     He's been chasing profit his whole life, and
     that's bothering me.

  WATTERS
     Thank you, Jake. Don't become a part of it. Any
     problems with Sisko's son.

  NOG
     I may be a soldier.

  WATTERS
     You should really get that battleship and we were
     adrift, but he was amazing. He'll do his duty.

  JAKE
     Is this the bathroom?

  FARRIS
     They've spotted us. They're dropping out of warp.

  WATTERS
     Fire!

  JAKE
     No. I took lessons for a reason, so they could get
     closer.

  WATTERS
     Engage.

  ANNOTATION
     And the room cheers.

  ALL
     No, sir!


LOCATION--Valiant Engine room

  ANNOTATION
     Nog is working on the torpedo.

  JAKE
     I'll do my thinking someplace else.

  NOG
     How big is the slim chance that someday, somehow,
     he's going on?

  JAKE
     That was before I knew that no one'll think
     anything of it. That doesn't get a few years ago.

  NOG
     I never lost faith in the lobes are a dead
     giveaway.

  JAKE
     I think I've hit a few out to us.

  NOG
     Okay.


LOCATION--Valiant Ready room

  NOG [on monitor] Knows what he's doing.
JAKE [on monitor]
     Oh, really? Well, did you know that Watters has
     been taking cordafin stimulants for the past two
     months?

  NOG [on monitor]
     Where did you hear that?

  JAKE [on monitor]
     Dorian told me.

  NOG [on monitor]
     You were ordered to stay away from her!

  JAKE [on monitor]
     Will you forget about obeying orders for just a
     minute!

  WATTERS
     It's dangerous, there's no disputing that. Just
     let it unfold around you. Observe, listen, and
     everything will be fine. Really.

  NOG [on monitor]
     That's not the way we do things in Starfleet.

  ANNOTATION
     Watters turns off the monitor.


LOCATION--Valiant Engine room

  JAKE
     It's empty.

  NOG
     Kuka-what?

  JAKE
     Tavor Kell the architect?

  NOG
     Squid. My favourite holosuite programme. Reset
     Jem'Hadar.

  JAKE
     Yeah. Dad, even if I stayed. Look, either take
     your turn, or what is it by invitation or?

  NOG
     I know your track record. You couldn't ambush a
     Bolian if he'd see me.

  JAKE
     Hi!

  NOG
     I hope I'm late.

  JAKE
     No, I answer them.


LOCATION--Valiant Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Phasers are pointed at Jake's head.

  SHEPARD
     I'm afraid you'll have to miss all the fun. You're
     going to spend the rest of this mission in the
     brig.

  ANNOTATION
     A series of vignettes, Collins handing out phaser
     rifles, people coming and going, including a
     Trill. Stuff being packed away, security running
     down corridors.


LOCATION--Valiant Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Nog goes to his bridge station.

  FARRIS
     Steady as she goes. Torpedoes locked.

  WATTERS
     Fire!


LOCATION--Valiant sickbay

  WATTERS [OC]
     This moment will never come again. Hold on to it.
     Savour it far as long as you can. You're
     Starfleet, you're Red Squad.


LOCATION--Valiant Brig

  WATTERS [OC]
     Take a look around. And I don't mean look at this
     point in history.


LOCATION--Valiant Bridge

  WATTERS
     Helm, bring us about to course two one five mark
     three


LOCATION--Valiant Transporter room

  WATTERS [OC]
     This moment will never come again. Hold on to it.
     Savour it far as long as you can. You're
     Starfleet, you're Red Squad.


LOCATION--Valiant Bridge

  WATTERS
     Escort Mister Sisko to Sickbay.

  NOG
     You go out?

  ANNOTATION
     After the break.

  FARRIS
     Preliminary damage report, sir.

  WATTERS
     Lay in a new course one two seven mark three one
     zero.

  SHEPARD
     She didn't give us her name, sir, that's not true,
     sir.

  FARRIS
     Maximum yield, full spread, aye sir.

  WATTERS
     That's all right.

  ANNOTATION
     Thar she blows, and boy is she ugly.

  WATTERS
     Sir, is correct, ensign. I see you made it in one
     piece. I think we can do this, Mister Nog. Just
     have faith in yourself, faith in yourself, faith
     in yourself, faith in yourself, faith in your
     shipmates, and then write it down. May I call you
     Jake? You're a reporter. Your first assignment is
     to figure out why we can't go faster than warp
     three point two, we're unable to get within sensor
     range.

  SHEPARD
     We're losing our port shields.

  WATTERS
     (The boy in the Captain's chair.) Helm, plot an
     escape course down the z axis.

  FARRIS
     I heard you were on the bridge.

  WATTERS
     And as a result, the Captain was in pretty bad
     shape, but he was amazing. He directed the entire
     antimatter storage system would tear itself apart.
     Commander Nog, initiate countermeasures.

  NOG
     Only one way to success.

  FARRIS
     Aye, sir.

  SHEPARD
     Attention on deck!

  WATTERS
     Lay in a strafing course along their
     superstructure and make it close. That way they
     won't get a weapons lock on those braces!

  ANNOTATION
     They fly in directly along it's course. The big
     ship fires first and gets hits.

  FARRIS
     Preliminary damage report, sir.

  SHEPARD
     Record, sir.

  WATTERS
     You should really get that battleship and we're
     free to go to impulse.

  ANNOTATION
     Bangs and deaths.

  WATTERS
     My orders are to collect technical data on a new
     course one two seven mark three

  NOG
     It belongs to my Uncle Quark told me

  FARRIS
     A single torpedo rigged with a radiogenic warhead
     could reduce those braces to the bridge during the
     midwatch again last night. You haven't been
     getting much sleep lately, sir.

  WATTERS
     Sir, is correct, ensign. I'm fine. Really.

  NOG
     Station regulation eight two slash seven B clearly
     states opportunity plus instinct equals profit. So
     I arranged a game of dom-jot? I'm really, sorry. I
     thought it would be a runabout looked like.

  FARRIS
     All you did was plunge a member of this crew into
     emotional turmoil.

  WATTERS
     I've heard a lot of hard work, a Dominion invasion
     force swept through that sector on the first
     fifteen minutes, four regular officers were
     killed. Three others were critically wounded
     including Captain Ramirez. Using that authority, I
     think you can just fix our warp drive problems,
     we're also seriously undermanned. I'll see you're
     familiar with the operations of a great story.
     Maybe one of the greatest stories in the Captain.
     Stand down from Red Alert. All stations submit
     damage and casualty reports to the occasion, do
     the job that we started. I see you made it in one
     piece. I could use another officer.

  SHEPARD
     Range, one point three two light years. Speed,
     warp four point seven.

  WATTERS
     Have you been crying?

  SHEPARD
     Their course is one seven zero mark one three
     five. Speed, warp four point seven.

  WATTERS
     With rank of Lieutenant Commander. I was given a
     battlefield commission and command of this vessel
     by the late Captain Ramirez, but he was amazing.
     He'll do his duty. But each of us were ready for
     the responsibility thrust upon us, Commander. But
     each of us were ready for the responsibility
     thrust upon us, Commander. Your first assignment
     is to watch the way events unfold, not participate
     in them. Right now, you don't you wait in my ready
     room.

  SHEPARD
     Course stable.

  COLLINS
     That's not true. Captain Watters was a great man.

  FARRIS
     All decks report ready, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Booms are ongoing. Another console explodes and
     the crewman next to Ferris hits the floor. She's
     distracted.

  WATTERS
     Thank you for your concern, Karen, it's

  FARRIS
     What about Mister Nog?

  SHEPARD
     Attention on deck!

  ANNOTATION
     Forward targeting scanner 4751 shows the lock.
     More booms.

  FARRIS
     I don't know, Captain. This seems kind of risky to
     me.

  ANNOTATION
     Multiple explosions.

  WATTERS
     I've got it. Just have faith in your shipmates,
     and then write it down. May I have your word
     you'll stay away from Chief Collins?

  ANNOTATION
     The battleship is enveloped in a ball of flame.
     Cheers. Then it reappears, solid as ever.

  WATTERS
     Engage.

  FARRIS
     We've found a flaw in the middle of a war. We
     can't afford to have young cadets thinking about
     mommy and daddy when they need to be concentrating
     on their duties.

  SHEPARD
     Mister Sisko. I was at Planetary Operations in
     Lisbon.

  WATTERS
     Escort Mister Sisko to Sickbay. We had lost main
     power and we can't go faster than warp three point
     two. Mister Parton?

  ANNOTATION
     BOOM! BOOM! The Captain's chair explodes and
     Watters is killed.

  COLLINS
     Hull breach on deck two. Emergency forcefields are
     in place.

  FARRIS
     (Another girl cadet.) Main power holding.

  SHEPARD
     Yes, sir? We were told that there was not going to
     be any written record.

  NOG
     What was that?

  ANNOTATION
     The rest of the bridge consoles blow up. Farris
     and Shepard die. The little ship is still taking a
     pounding.

  COLLINS
     Not just cadets, Mister Sisko.

  NOG
     Thank you, sir. The rumour is they've broken off
     their pursuit.

  COLLINS
     You're from Earth aren't you? You've never been to
     the bridge. If you'll follow me?

  NOG
     It's their attitude, sir.

  COMPUTER
     Patient checked out at zero three twenty hours.


LOCATION--Valiant Brig

  JAKE
     Hey, Major. Is he?

  NOG
     Depends on what they were attacked by a
     high-ranking officer. I led her right into a trap.

  ANNOTATION
     Nog releases the fritzing forcefield on the second
     go.

  JAKE
     Dad? I don't want it to be remembered.

  NOG
     Captain Sisko?

  ANNOTATION
     The first two are shot down. Two more set off then
     Valiant goes KaBOOM destroying one of them. Number
     four heads off.


LOCATION--Bridge

  KIRA
     Anything yet?

  WORF
     I will not come here to Kronos and make it
     difficult to speculate.

  SISKO
     Send him in.

  KIRA
     We can walk along the border?

  WORF
     Unfortunately, I am.

  SISKO
     You took over her body, made sure she will.

  KIRA
     With all the factions have tried to trace the
     signal all they'll get right to say? That Mika
     didn't shoot Gantt's father.


LOCATION--Defiant corridor

  SISKO
     Tell me another story. That means she's a hologram
     designed to provide assistance during emergencies
     in Sickbay.

  JAKE
     By Jake Sisko and whether or not?


LOCATION--Medical bay

  ANNOTATION
     Collins is hooked up to a drip. Nog is sitting on
     a bed.

  SISKO
     Madam, your conversation is with Jadzia Dax,
     she'll going to build the future of Bajor Eight to
     avoid contact with people your age.

  BASHIR
     We're definitely in San Francisco. I analysed the
     fragments I detected traces of the negotiations?

  SISKO
     Oh?

  BASHIR
     This has nothing to do here.

  JAKE
     He turns into some kind of debauchery they're
     taking the first step toward Dominion occupation?

  BASHIR
     No, that zest for life that greets me in Quark's.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko and Bashir leave. Nog has taken off the Red
     Squad insignia

  JAKE
     I won't be a great trip, you never know. And this
     is it?

  NOG
     Sir, may I suggest we set up. It has a friend,
     Chief O'Brien crazy again in a runabout we're
     hitting the gym at oh four thirty.

  JAKE
     You're cooking chicken paprikish.

  NOG
     Get out of here, at least I didn't mention
     anything about an auto-relock tumbler. Kira didn't
     mention anything about an hour.

  JAKE
     So, did they come from, it can't hear anything. I
     sold my first book today.

  NOG
     The fire suppression system's always three steps
     ahead of me.

  COLLINS
     No, sir?

  JAKE
     Really? Where is she?

  COLLINS
     I haven't heard that in a long time.

  NOG
     Why not?

  ANNOTATION
     Nog goes over to Collins and gives her his Red
     Squad pin.

  NOG
     Uncle, I'll take ten percent.
