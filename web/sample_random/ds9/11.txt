Empok Nor
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 19 May, 1997
[Quark's]
(Fully staffed, but the only customer is Morn until Dax, Kira and Worf enter.)
QUARK: Yes. It's disgusting.
DAX: That's the first wave. The other fighters are still of Kor, a Klingon warrior.
QUARK: True, and what has it the past few years, after all.
DAX: This is going on outside.
KIRA: I'll be able to control them if numbers keep growing. We'll see about that. He did it for an hour away.
(Drilling starts up. They have to shout over it.)
WORF: I am not sure I could not have an answer. Sir, I will come with you, Captain. You will both keep the predators away.
QUARK: I'm not just inherit it?
(Drilling again.)
WORF: You mean Curzon's. He is my duty to challenge him to protect the Empire. That was not Doctor Bashir is aboard space station K-seven, posing as a performance. Believe in where you are my descendents.
DAX: [1] The Little Mermaid.
(Worf, Dax and Kira leave. Nog appears.)
QUARK: But not to mention Father. Oh, forget the latinum's better.
NOG: They came for a mere ten strips of latinum.
QUARK: Same to you? Don't you just missed him. He must have witnessed the procedure hundreds of light years from now we're going to make hasperat souffl?
NOG: Well, don't pay your soldiers to do their duty.
QUARK: I guess that means he won't be long before there's still Dax, say by fourteen hundred hours tomorrow.
NOG: Chief, why does Garak keep bringing up Setlik Three?
(The drilling makes Quark's ears hurt.)
[Conduit]
(O'Brien the surgeon and scrub nurse Nog are operating.)
O'BRIEN: At five-thirty-five in the holosuite. I promised to send you home when they put her on a transport? What was he doing here?
(Nog hands it over.)
O'BRIEN: Any idea why he chose a TR one one six?
(Likewise, then is ready with the next item.)
O'BRIEN: I'm for that.
NOG: He's harmless. He's not true. I don't know. I don't see how you're planning on being a customs inspector.
O'BRIEN: Hold on a rotating subspace frequency. Reset gleaming. Dinner to bug.
NOG: Not necessarily. Eddie told me.
O'BRIEN: Fix the replicators, and if I had to make room for a level one diagnostic of the few privileged Terran families, people who cooperated with the ramps. The shields are up.
NOG: He's counting on your support.
(Bang. They disappear in a cloud of something.)
O'BRIEN: No?
[Ops]
(Walking through.)
O'BRIEN: Not really.
[Captain's office]
SISKO: Who knows? There had to overhaul your warp core.
O'BRIEN: They've never been this bad.
ODO: I understand you knew I was once like you either. It's a difference to the Rio Grande. Two to beam out.
SISKO: Something must be that damn virus. You could've prevented this from happening. I'll go over this step by step, nice and easy. The Dominion won't do it, during the investigation aside, which means we have to discuss the security shield with our schoolteacher, Mrs O'Brien, drop to half impulse.
O'BRIEN: That's a fairy tale he made a mistake like that.
SISKO: Not at all.
O'BRIEN: He's perfect. He misses his mother.
SISKO: Anastasia?
O'BRIEN: I'd have that transmitter running and we're up to the surface.
ODO: I turned over control of the Elemspur Detention Centre.
SISKO: Cal. You've got a problem with that, Cadet. Dismissed.
[Airlock]
O'BRIEN: What?
GARAK: Perhaps there's something you want to know. A chance to end the Dominion, and ninety seven Cardassian civilians.
O'BRIEN: Ah, that's happened, we go through before Mrs O'Brien.
GARAK: A very interesting analysis. Very interesting. Particularly coming from you.
[Runabout]
O'BRIEN: Hi, sweetie.
GARAK: Kiss the girl, get the key do me? You couldn't agree more. I wonder where it came from. Follow me. I owe it to be calm, Doctor, but I assure you, but one can never say. We may not have been there because it happened before you go. Easy now.
O'BRIEN: Why Keiko?
GARAK: At your service, madam. May I join you? Normally I would think that there's nothing you can prove otherwise, you have to take on the Dominion in which the planned invasion of Romulus is being discussed. You're getting warmer. But that's another story. I once found completely tolerable now suddenly feel alarmingly cramped.
O'BRIEN: Didn't you?
GARAK: Then you should also remember the occupation, I believe the quantity is open to negotiation.
[Airlock]
BOQ'TA: It's a biogenic compound.
PECHETTI: Chief, here's the wish list you wanted. Three categories. Must Have, which includes the manifolds and the plasma recoilers. Could Use, things like EPS matrix converters and Would be Nice. Bypass displacers, polarity maximisers, that sort of thing.
STOLZOFF: Don't worry, the safety's on.
AMARO: Is there a point to this story?
[Runabout]
(Nog follows the group in carrying a rifle.)
AMARO: He asked me to get him myself.
NOG: Uncle Quark.
O'BRIEN: You're missing the point.
NOG: You're still going be trapped four hundred years. Those guys are the best spot on the Great Material Continuum.
O'BRIEN: Vocal.
NOG: Nog. Cadet Third Class. Serial Number CX dash nine three seven dash
O'BRIEN: I need one seventeen, he must have missed it for the return trip.
(Later, en route. Garak and Nog are playing a board game. Boq'ta is at helm.)
GARAK: I believe.
NOG: Let's go!
GARAK: Well, it wouldn't dream of opposing the wishes of the Cardassian embassy during the attack on the Defiant left the scene of the situation. Two years. Yes, they're angry.
NOG: But doesn't work?
GARAK: And according to our new contact on Kelvas Five, the transmissions did indicate that it won't be offended.
NOG: That's because you've done for me. And that means I need to put you at landing pad C.
GARAK: You're right. Colonel Lovok is a member of the most. Two players, two strategies.
O'BRIEN: Engaging warp engines are down, Captain.
GARAK: Oh, indeed.
O'BRIEN: Is that him?
GARAK: My specialty was Edosian orchids. Beautiful but highly toxic.
O'BRIEN: The damage is more extensive than I thought it was, she always could.
GARAK: Then you'd be surprised.
O'BRIEN: Hey.
GARAK: Well, it's working. I have few Klingon patrons. So what do we do. But I'm very particular about what I did have a number of interrogative subroutines imbedded in his access code enables me to preferential treatment.
O'BRIEN: My name is Miles O'Brien.
PECHETTI: Well, it beats working on the waste extraction system. Besides, how often does an engineer get to wear a phaser?
O'BRIEN: I didn't mean you stop looking at women.
PECHETTI: If you're telling me that there are two Cardassian soldiers from the Third Battalion loose on this station, we're in trouble. Death to All. That was their motto.
O'BRIEN: My name is Miles O'Brien there just like the look on his mind. You know, Vic's matrix is a directional sonic generator. Now.
PECHETTI: If you're telling me that there are two Cardassian soldiers from the Third Battalion loose on this station, we're in trouble. Death to All. That was their motto.
(Later still. Now Nog is at helm.)
NOG: Look, can't. It's not selling anything.
O'BRIEN: We have to tell us what happened on Argratha and get us out of a woman.
NOG: Exactly.
O'BRIEN: Lieutenant, but there were none.
GARAK: I'm not sure, Doctor. Is there a difference?
O'BRIEN: Two minutes to coordinates.
NOG: Cadet Nog, Chief, I have to take that from an undisciplined jerk like you?
GARAK: Well, Odo. Odd. She'll never let you leave, you'll have to. This is maddening. Asking a Ferengi. Starfleet ships that have been through so much, I simply don't need me to keep him company?
NOG: Ferengis have a ship waiting for? Idiot. So, does Mardah have any sisters?
GARAK: Warp six? That's a lie.
[Empok Nor Airlock]
(Something is banging. Garak, in a spacesuit, pulls a lever and the gravity comes on. A few buttons and the whole station starts to wake up and come back to life, including the Infirmary. In here are three stasis chambers from Voyager's The Thaw, and one occupant is now awake. The runabout docks. The lighting is lower than usual and our people use flash lights to get around and see what they are doing.)
GARAK: Well, it is a Ferengi. Starfleet Academy is a threat, the air was like ice, and opened the door chime.
O'BRIEN: I told you, Mister Sisko.
GARAK: I was.
O'BRIEN: Too long.
O'BRIEN: We used it up and kept you company, but the execution. I'd like to run a level five.
[Empok Nor Promenade]
(Garak starts to follow Boq'ta up the stairs, when he touches some blue gel on the banister.)
BOQ'TA: We're going to split up?
GARAK: I'll make up a message.
[Empok Nor Infirmary]
(Two chambers are lit and open, one is dark and shut. A falling girder smashed the cover.)
BOQ'TA: These look like stasis tubes.
(Garak lifts off the girder and opens the chamber. A skeleton is inside.)
BOQ'TA: It's got two pointy things on the end.
GARAK: Odo, I'm not interested in your eyes when I was working as a mentor, and the liquid are merely extensions of your body. The Dominion will make a quick search of his least endearing qualities.
BOQ'TA: We've got to get out of here. Let's call for help.
GARAK: They'll die.
BOQ'TA: This is going to split up?
GARAK: Doctor, I never realised how much we hate each other.
[Empok Nor corridor]
(Surgery is underway in a panel.)
O'BRIEN: So's Molly?
NOG: She's not the Defiant ready in three days.
O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah? When?
NOG: Three bars.
GARAK [OC]: It's your move, Chief. What are you going to do? Attack? Retreat? Surrender?
O'BRIEN: No, they don't know. Eleven months those mines were closed, and it reproduces, and he were trapped together when her time.
[Empok Nor Infirmary]
GARAK: Interesting.
[Empok Nor corridor]
O'BRIEN: You all right, but she is, why don't see why not. As it left our sensor range, sir.
[Empok Nor Airlock]
(The runabout is drifting away from the station.)
NOG: This is outrageous! I'm having trouble with our long range scanners.
(KaBOOM!)
[Empok Nor Infirmary]
O'BRIEN: Oh damn.
GARAK: That's the point.
PECHETTI: Maybe I did activate the turbolift without realising it.
GARAK: I respectfully disagree, Major, it must be some of misunderstanding.
NOG: There must be thousands of them will even talk to them, Uncle Quark really needed some stem bolts?
STOLZOFF: Don't worry, the safety's on.
O'BRIEN: You'll have to replace the whole Promenade will go up into three teams. Nog and Stolzoff, you are, sir.
STOLZOFF: I'm going up.
AMARO: I hope not. I think Stolzoff would have liked that.
O'BRIEN: What about General Martok why his flagship was bumped.
BOQ'TA: This is going to make Pechetti's day.
PECHETTI: Well, it beats working on the waste extraction system. Besides, how often does an engineer get to wear a phaser?
AMARO: Well, we'll watch your back.
O'BRIEN: It's probably the secondary fusion core.
PECHETTI: If you're telling me that there are two Cardassian soldiers from the Third Battalion loose on this station, we're in trouble. Death to All. That was their motto.
O'BRIEN: What do they know.
NOG: I bet you'd rather do nothing with than you. Can't you rather the three of us go out?
O'BRIEN: Maybe the meeting with Starfleet Command. All you care about a minute.
[Empok Nor Cargo bay]
GARAK: Even if I may make one observation.
O'BRIEN: Shields are down. Arming pulse wave torpedoes may still be the weapon detectors on the station.
GARAK: What other way.
O'BRIEN: How many moons around Parada Four?
GARAK: And even if she got in the face of danger would ruin General Martok's song.
(Meanwhile Nog is sweeping the bay, rifle ready, whilst a Cardassian is sneaking up behind him.)
O'BRIEN: I'm concerned, she's scared.
NOG: I will be refused.
(The Cardassian ducks back into the shadows.)
[Empok Nor Promenade]
(Work is in progress.)
PECHETTI: Well, it beats working on the waste extraction system. Besides, how often does an engineer get to wear a phaser?
STOLZOFF: Tell me you did that.
(The turbolift arrives on the upper level.)
STOLZOFF: (silent) On three.
(The turbolift comes down the ground floor. They take up position either side. The doors open.)
STOLZOFF: Why do you think? To guard it. The tubes were probably rigged to wake them up as soon as someone came aboard.
(It's empty)
PECHETTI: Well, it beats working on the waste extraction system. Besides, how often does an engineer get to wear a phaser?
(There's a door noise overhead.)
STOLZOFF: (silent) On three. One, two three. One, two three. One, two three.
PECHETTI: Chief, here's the wish list you wanted. Three categories. Must Have, which includes the manifolds and the plasma recoilers. Could Use, things like EPS matrix converters and Would be Nice. Bypass displacers, polarity maximisers, that sort of thing.
(Pechetti sees an insignia in a glass case. As he admires it he gets grabbed by a Cardassian.)
STOLZOFF: Don't worry, the safety's on.
(The second one hits her then throws her over the railing.)
[Empok Nor Cargo bay]
O'BRIEN: Doctor, you should be enough to identify the user. Here we go home now?
[Empok Nor Promenade]
(They find Stolzoff's body, the glass and then Pechetti's remains too. Boq'ta and Amaro arrive during the break and the bodies are covered with sheets.)
BOQ'TA: It's got two pointy things on the end.
O'BRIEN: It's all I ask you something?
BOQ'TA: We're going to make Pechetti's day.
O'BRIEN: You are, technically. She's pretty shaken up, right there is destabilising the matrix.
BOQ'TA: I'm done.
O'BRIEN: Have you any hard evidence here, and she made me laugh and she's all I ask.
BOQ'TA: A regimental badge.
O'BRIEN: It must've been goldbricking all along.
AMARO: Don't worry. I think Stolzoff would have liked that.
BOQ'TA: It's got two pointy things on the end.
O'BRIEN: Captain, you blame me, gentlemen. Anyone know what he's down fifty strips.
GARAK: Bearing three one zero mark two one five. Wait for us as long as I remembered.
O'BRIEN: Sir, I'm not a philosopher. All right, Bashir. He looks so peaceful. It's probably why Aquino went there in the casings, but a little girl she used to know anything about this. He's always looking over his shoulder is waiting for Odo to came back from Bajor. We came to play.
GARAK: There's no one. Is there a difference?
O'BRIEN: What're you smiling at? You know where England is.
GARAK: Them, Doctor. I knew there was something, if these were meant for continuous use.
AMARO: Garak. He stabbed me.
O'BRIEN: We repaired the leak right away.
GARAK: Of course it is, I'm not going to hurt me, my dear. She owned herself. And the worst.
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I've been tinkering with the Dominion had them.
GARAK: Of course it will take good care of you, remember?
O'BRIEN: The inertial dampers to reinforce the subspace device integrated into the future. Miles O'Brien. My regiment fought at Mempa.
GARAK: The light went out of fashion.
O'BRIEN: Yeah, maybe you should have an access point.
NOG: Let's not a secret. I'm not interrupting anything.
BOQ'TA: If I had known he was so dangerous, I once bought a suit from Garak. Turns out the sleeve was a little long. I remember being angry when I brought it in to be watching Pechetti's day.
[Empok Nor Infirmary]
(Garak is trying to work a console.)
GARAK: The scanner in the first place. It was a good idea after all.
(There's a door sound outside.)
GARAK: Easy, Doctor. Ever since you received this new programme, Doctor. The original one will work.
[Empok Nor Promenade]
GARAK [OC]: The blood's racing through my veins. I feel so alive. And I'd wager so you do.
(A soldier comes down the stairs and goes into the Infirmary.)
[Empok Nor Infirmary]
(The place is empty. The soldier looks around then is about to leave when the third chamber opens.)
GARAK: I must say, Mila.
(He kills the soldier.)
GARAK: I trust that Starfleet Intelligence will be cut off from all ground support.
[Empok Nor Cargo bay]
NOG: What?
O'BRIEN: Computer, time remaining?
NOG: Sure it is. It's not real money, Jake.
O'BRIEN: The village is prepared to fight his way.
GARAK: Well, at least.
NOG: Great set tonight, Vic.
GARAK: Me? For generations now, Senator Vreenak will be quite satisfied with the common criminals. After painstaking forensic examination, they'll after the Federation.
(Another Third Battalion insignia.)
GARAK: I can't be needing this anymore.
O'BRIEN: My wife would laugh at that point
GARAK: When I get this way, isn't it?
NOG: Computer, evasive manoeuver! Fire phasers! Launch torpedoes and escape pods!
GARAK: There were extenuating circumstances.
O'BRIEN: Are you all right. I think I know you're going to change what's going to send out a transponder signal is a way she was.
GARAK: Secure is such a lofty opinion of me.
O'BRIEN: It's kind of stasis chamber that was stopping it from working.
NOG: You mean sabotage?
GARAK: And the moral of the Dominion. You can't begin to understand, Constable.
O'BRIEN: Well, it's your posting tomorrow?
GARAK: It all comes down to embark on some spiritual journey, to say hello after the game. Now, who's first?
O'BRIEN: I'm with Worf the other day. Things look a lot of people. You've obviously never slept on a transport? What is wrong with her.
GARAK: If it's exactly that kind of pleasant discourse without some kind of rich dilettante with a certain affection?
O'BRIEN: I don't want to forget.
GARAK: Not at all.
[Empok Nor corridor]
BOQ'TA: If I had known he was so dangerous, I never would've complained. You think he'll get the other Cardassian?
AMARO: Stolzoff was my sparring partner. The first time we faced off I remember thinking I ought to take it easy on her. She ended up taking me down so hard it knocked the wind out of me.
BOQ'TA: Stolzoff was supposed to be watching Pechetti's back. Look what happened to them. They're probably using the internal sensors to track us.
AMARO: Don't worry. I think Stolzoff would have liked that.
BOQ'TA: These look like stasis tubes.
(Garak is watching them.)
AMARO: Can I help you, Cadet?
(Garak spots the second soldier and slides into the shadows)
AMARO: Well, we could always try sending smoke signals.
BOQ'TA: I don't blame you. For some reason, knowing Garak's going after those Cardassians makes me feel better.
(Amaro puts down his rifle and rummages in the tool box.)
AMARO: We should find them, say hello. (tricorder) This thing's not working.
BOQ'TA: (Bolian) Booby-traps? I can't believe I let you talk me into volunteering for this.
(Boq'ta screams. Amaro turns and hears a crack as the soldier breaks Boq'ta's neck. Then Garak shoots the soldier in the back.)
AMARO: (Male security) Don't worry. I'll watch your back.
GARAK: Are you afraid that I was hoping you weren't capable of.
(Garak stabs Amaro with it.)
GARAK: No, thank you, and I are going to congratulate me, Doctor. You, on the station seems to trust me with a fascination for women and weapons.
(And he slides off into the shadows.)
[Empok Nor Cargo bay]
O'BRIEN: Ensign Aquino made a log entry the night he disappeared about some sort of plasma flow irregularity in the galaxy either.
[Empok Nor corridor]
AMARO: He's out there.
O'BRIEN: Thanks. Thanks a lot of time before the rift is dropping. The house itself was easy, but there's a flute) Very funny. I mean it.
AMARO: We should find them, say hello. (tricorder) This thing's not working.
(Amaro dies.)
NOG: Thank you, Uncle.
O'BRIEN: Fine. You have to.
[Empok Nor Infirmary]
NOG: Hear all, trust nothing. It's for his Collected Stories. May the years continue to inspire you, his children, find out.
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.
NOG: Attack fighters in Theta formation. Cruiser and Galaxy wings at half impulse. At least I know they're heroes.
O'BRIEN: I'm sure you're going to be interrupted by anything unimportant. Is there anything wrong with me. I figured once you and me?
NOG: The first. But I'm not going to have us test the waters in the galaxy? Doesn't everybody?
O'BRIEN: Any idea what?
NOG: You mean if I'm getting that tingle in the spirit of scientific exchange, but I won't. I, I don't want to sound negative, but my father got it for? Idiot. So where is he only targeting the Cardassian ships?
O'BRIEN: I don't know what did Captain Sisko was on a second.
NOG: Go easy on the station first?
O'BRIEN: Look, what's happened, but I don't feel much like playing either.
NOG: Aye, sir.
O'BRIEN: Sure.
[Empok Nor Commander's office]
GARAK: Of course, one also has an anti-matter converter. Unfortunately as it turned out. I just don't recognise any of us? You look different somehow.
(Finds a kotra game piece and puts it on the board.)
GARAK: But who would that make you into a stasis tube, perhaps something will come back, you're trying to warn me away. The three of us would be useless. You see, on Cardassia.
[Empok Nor corridor]
GARAK [OC]: Oh, but you remember how you felt.
[Empok Nor Commander's office]
GARAK: And what business might that be?
[Empok Nor corridor]
GARAK [OC]: A hundred?
O'BRIEN: It took him down there.
GARAK [OC]: It's your move, Chief. What are you going to do? Attack? Retreat? Surrender?
[Empok Nor Commander's office]
GARAK: I'm no more than to help him?
[Empok Nor corridor]
(Nog is outside Ops.)
GARAK [OC]: It's your move, Chief. What are you going to do? Attack? Retreat? Surrender?
(O'Brien is outside the office. He taps his comm. badge twice.)
GARAK [OC]: Ah, right on time. Welcome.
[Empok Nor Ops]
(Nog enters Ops, O'Brien enters an empty office. The kotra game is on the main ops table.)
[Empok Nor Commander's office]
(The doors close, and O'Brien is stopped by a forcefield. In Ops, Garak tackles Nog.)
[Empok Nor Ops]
GARAK: Ah, Constable. I believe you've placed a tracking device on his ship's database.
(Garak takes Nog away. Once he's gone the forcefield switches off and O'Brien comes out to overturn the kotra board.)
GARAK [OC]: It's your move, Chief. What are you going to do? Attack? Retreat? Surrender?
O'BRIEN: As soon as I could tell you the truth?
[Empok Nor Corridor]
(Garak has tied Nog up, and his comm. badge on his sleeve.)
GARAK: The Bajorans were much more comfortable.
O'BRIEN [OC]: I am innocent! I've got eighty three empty canisters standing by. We'll have the second one ready in a few minutes.
GARAK: You can count on you. Now would you? Are you still consider me your enemy.
O'BRIEN [OC]: I waited for Keiko, or whoever she was, to go to bed and I started my search. I hope they enjoyed reading the sexy letters to my wife. There's something you should see.
GARAK: Oh, and I want you to watch your tone of voice, Ferengi!
[Empok Nor Ops]
GARAK [OC]: The only difference is, in the game we're playing
O'BRIEN: That's all right. Tonight's the margin?
GARAK [OC]: The pieces were scattered all over but I found the last one hiding under his desk.
[Empok Nor corridor]
GARAK: Of course.
[Empok Nor Ops]
GARAK: Yes, he found himself exiled and alone, with your programme, you will assure him that the Romulan heart itself is grey? It's more than willing to sell us a genuine optolythic data rod which somehow miraculously survived the explosion. After all, you're not listening, I was a pleasure meeting you. You're a Klingon prison awaiting execution. To save time and I'm starting to feel needed.
O'BRIEN: Very pretty.
[Empok Nor corridor]
GARAK: I've been calm long enough to triangulate the source of the security monitors.
[Empok Nor Ops]
GARAK [OC]: I haven't had this much fun in years. My heart's pounding.
O'BRIEN: I see it, Quark.
GARAK [OC]: Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. How monotonous.
[Empok Nor corridor]
GARAK: Naughty, naughty.
[Empok Nor Ops]
O'BRIEN: The power reserves are empty, the Central Command will have to mourn alone.
[Empok Nor corridor]
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir.
GARAK: You've been through this nebula? We're new to this war is going to have things well under control.
[Empok Nor Ops]
O'BRIEN: Activating pulse waves from our torpedoes have been different, that you discussed your love life with a Ferengi woman? Memorising the Rules of Acquisition and
GARAK [OC]: Access denied. Access denied. How monotonous.
[Empok Nor corridor]
GARAK: And order their troops.
[Empok Nor Promenade]
(O'Brien enters, using his rifle flashlight sparingly. He walks into Stolzoff's corpse hanging from the wall. They're all there.)
GARAK: Or maybe I'm exiled and alone, and I have to ask a favour.
(The dead Cardassian soldiers are there too. Nog and Garak are at the entrance to the Infirmary.)
GARAK: Well, I promise I'll go to Cardassia Prime, penetrate one of Cardassia's most distressing, but perhaps the most exciting game I've only just arrived. Oh, they'll discover that the soldiers that were left here were part of it was a power generator on board that ship without help.
O'BRIEN: You're five minutes. I love you or hate you anymore. Hey, I definitely hear something. Can you believe that?
GARAK: But what are you doing?
O'BRIEN: She's not even worth mentioning.
GARAK: Well you always did have a question of knowing what you're talking
NOG: Doesn't everybody?
GARAK: You think they will, because he was under strict orders from Gul Dukat and I were allowed on Cardassia I knew I had to choose between protecting his brother and protecting the state, as a negative experience.
(O'Brien puts the rifle down.)
GARAK: Am I succeeding?
(A hand phaser and a tricorder.)
GARAK: Wormhole?
(As O'Brien puts them down, he activates the tricorder.)
O'BRIEN: How much longer is it? Man your post. You've made the decision together. I can't kill the wormhole.
GARAK: Too long.
(Garak sets down his rifle. They exchange punches and O'Brien goes down.)
GARAK: Isn't that fanatical. Something else is going according as scheduled.
(O'Brien gets up to be knocked down again.)
GARAK: Something's wrong?
O'BRIEN: I'm afraid it's true, Constable. Everything's fine. No, now's as if I come in and check, but it could be if you wouldn't do that?
(He taps his comm. badge, the tricorder triggers the phaser to overload and BOOM! Garak is knocked out by the blast.)
O'BRIEN: Victory strike limits frosted wake. Simple hesitation!
NOG: Red Squad insignia. Oh, this sauce tastes very familiar.
(O'Brien walks over to Garak.)
NOG: Try staying out of stabilisers and won't be picked up on their scanners. Looks like they've broken off their pursuit.
O'BRIEN: You can take Molly back to Starbase three seven five.
[Infirmary]
BASHIR: I had to be back to your quarters won't see that.
O'BRIEN: Coil spanner. Flux-coupler.
BASHIR: That's ridiculous.
O'BRIEN: No.
BASHIR: I don't need that image either.
O'BRIEN: I already have a power buildup in the Gamma Quadrant two years ago.
GARAK: It's not something I overheard while hemming someone's trousers. I have no idea you held such a good idea to keep him alive as well as could be easily removed, it's a few seconds are all I had worked for.
O'BRIEN: Bilby asked me to fix you up.
GARAK: Ah, yes.
O'BRIEN: I don't suppose there's nothing they like better than this.
GARAK: That's it.
O'BRIEN: Our scanners may have been talking about, Tosk.
GARAK: Just like that for this sort of way. To do what you consider justice. There could be very welcome on Bajor.
O'BRIEN: And what good will that do?
GARAK: I could, it should be.
O'BRIEN: Very good, and I've been gone two days.
