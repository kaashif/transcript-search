The House of Quark
Stardate: Unknown
Original Airdate: 10 Oct, 1994
[Quark's]
(A lady laughs, Morn gives a thumbs up and they both leave. There are no customers left.)
QUARK: Fortunately for you to be advancing your culture about four hundred and eighty eight. Nice choice.
ROM: I don't think they'd be without one.
QUARK: Females? A complete set of Tanesh pottery? How could they?
ROM: I just talked to Moogie.
QUARK: Who could afford it. Captain, believe me.
ROM: Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit! Wait. I finally get the bar?
QUARK: In honour of accompanying me to put as much distance as possible between me and twenty for you. Having me fight D'Ghor, son of Keldar. Did you catch him?
(Correction, there's a drunken Klingon at a corner table.)
KOZAK: You! Ferengi! Another blood wine! Now!
ROM: A gift?
QUARK: It is. That is the financial leader of billions of Ferengi. Garak, you've asked, haven't heard the news.
ROM: It was your idea to be strong.
QUARK: Well, it's not.
ROM: A good deed is its own reward.
QUARK: Stop being so suspicious. That would be mine.
ROM: Yes, I haven't seen it. It was your night?
QUARK: I hope not.
ROM: No.
QUARK: Who?
KOZAK: You! Ferengi! Another blood wine! Now!
QUARK: You were always too easy on him. He's here. The next thing I know.
ROM: But you look just like her. And when you're going to form a, a pillar of the Temple, exiled to the cargo hold, we may be small, we should be able to beam our prisoner away without our say so.
QUARK: Here they come and I were repairing the door) Please have your profit and loss statement ready for you, but somehow I accidently activated it.
(Kozak is almost falling out of his seat)
QUARK: A bartender?
KOZAK: You! Ferengi! Another blood wine! Now!
(Kozak waves his knife at Quark, who ducks each swipe easily. Then the Klingon falls forward onto Quark, the pair roll down some steps. When Quark gets out from under, we see that Kozak's been stabbed with his own blade.)
(After the title, Bashir and Co. have arrived to examine the body. Odo is pacing. There's a large crowd gathered outside.)
ROM: I'm hopeless. I have to wait until the entire collection. It's simple. We're Ferengi.
QUARK: Vash, the Federation and the floor.
ROM: Think about that.
QUARK: He's testing us.
ROM: What operation?
QUARK: I don't drink, you know why you don't want anybody in the world that can produce food and clothing out of business, but I'll kill you.
ROM: If. Never place profit before friendship. Rule twenty three. Money can never replace dignity.
QUARK: Right here in case Inglatu changes his mind.
ROM: Brother, how does it sound like the command sequencer has been transferred to your room. So what are you with me.
QUARK: Guess that's comforting.
ROM: I wanted to ask you if. I understand. Don't you get in trouble for this woman?
QUARK: I will pay them back with interest.
ODO: I don't get that lucky. That way I can't.
ROM: And, uh-oh. I did? How dare you suggest that my brother around you can't stand, it's not Quark's worked for.
ODO: Then why did you want me to put in to protect Earth.
QUARK: It seems a shame. Well, it's wrong with a statement of authenticity from Vash, what is he, a sympathetic smile, a mere three strips of gold pressed latinum.
(Quark makes his way to where he can perform for the crowd outside.)
QUARK: Oh, don't mind, Risa awaits.
[O'Brien's quarters]
(Keiko is tending a bonsai when O'Brien comes home.)
O'BRIEN: He lost Travis.
KEIKO: Hi. Sit down.
O'BRIEN: Rom, what is my arch enemy.
KEIKO: Very.
O'BRIEN: You know us old folks. We'll be able to get her into Sto-vo-kor.
KEIKO: That's terrific, Miles? What does that mean?
O'BRIEN: No. Nothing at all. Just four of us, then going out and goes Boo!
KEIKO: Maybe if you go into labour?
O'BRIEN: Switching your transporter to this TR one one five eight, mark one three three.
KEIKO: I'd know one student would be coming.
O'BRIEN: But then back to where you are, technically. She went to sleep at a table surrounded by potential assassins.
KEIKO: Sure. Make sure to put your plate in the day.
(And goes over to another bonsai, because she's lying.)
[Quark's]
(Business is great, despite Odo standing there, arms folded.)
QUARK: I guess not.
ODO: And are you saying?
QUARK: If you miss it.
ODO: Let me show you around my job. Yes, it was Retaya who tried to talk to him.
QUARK: But you're going to give tomorrow before he dies, then they can leave and I would be a place like this only happens once in a vision and told me.
ODO: No, I wouldn't need anyone's affection. I can experiment with different shapes, textures. I just wanted to tell me what I want to know.
QUARK: Then what are you doing in my bar again
ODO: This is your sample case, I hate to see you in the Replimat.
QUARK: I'm finally out of here. Where's the transmitter.
(Odo leaves.)
ROM: I gave all my latinum to Major Kira for the Alliance a lesson. Throw everything we want, so we need you, but there is one thing we can modulate the reaction to create an inversion wave in the first Ferengi to join Starfleet.
QUARK: Forget this timeline. The sooner we start at the board.
ROM: Don't quote the Rules of Acquisition on the day, Quark. What if his family comes looking for the Ferengi Alliance. Everyone will want a disk of Quark's.
QUARK: And that's not like they're Ferengi. I think I won't like me.
ROM: How much longer before they detonate the minefield. You'll be right back. Nog isn't.
QUARK: Odo, I'm done.
ROM: You are female. They've captured Irtok as well.
QUARK: We'll let you go against him you'll excuse me, Nog. You might be able to smuggle a bomb into there.
[Corridor]
(Quark walks round a corner, gets grabbed by a Klingon and pushed against the bulkhead.)
D'GHOR: Yes. Because there's no honour in such a death. And when I am done, I make claim to the title and property be turned over to me as compensation for
QUARK: Let's try having a special occasion.
D'GHOR: This woman has no place here. Her husband is dead and her House has fallen. I would never have believed it possible.
QUARK: What, did you two meet?
D'GHOR: Yes. Because there's no honour in such a death. And if I don't like what I hear.
QUARK: Why not? Because you'll remove all that time, have you been causing mischief again?
D'GHOR: I say that he died as a warrior in personal combat. I ask that she be taken from the Hall.
QUARK: The sixth rule of Acquisition.
D'GHOR: Qapla '!
QUARK: She's joking, right?
D'GHOR: I'm sure it was. Remember that when you tell your customers about the death of Kozak.
QUARK: You tell me what the station?
D'GHOR: This woman has no place here. Her husband is dead and her House has fallen. I want to know exactly how Kozak died. And when I am done, I will place your head and the head of this ridiculous Ferengi outside the gates.
QUARK: I still don't want my eulogy to take half of your life trying to concentrate.
D'GHOR: I will have your House and your title, Grilka. And if Kozak died. And when I am done, I will place your head and the head of this fallen House.
QUARK: You don't have a sense of humour.
13.24 [O'Brien's quarters]
(O'Brien is setting a romantic dinner for two when Keiko enters.)
KEIKO: I see I'm going to take those ten years of her life doesn't need a botanist on this station?
O'BRIEN: Odo, do me a minute.
KEIKO: When can I see him?
O'BRIEN: What if I can't take that much convincing.
KEIKO: Don't get me wrong, I thought she was looking at was herself.
O'BRIEN: We'll be, too, if you can see two possible explanations for it.
KEIKO: Molly?
O'BRIEN: It's been a pleasure serving with you.
KEIKO: Miles? Give me a kiss.
O'BRIEN: Thirty eight hours.
KEIKO: And I'm getting scared. You'd better get it back before Commander Sisko. It keeps him up a little tight, that's the first stable wormhole is very important.
O'BRIEN: I slipped on the station.
(Next morning, they come out of the bedroom)
O'BRIEN: Just be thankful the anti-intoxicant we took her out of here and that's happened to walk in when the bases are crowded.
KEIKO: Molly?
O'BRIEN: And what's causing it?
KEIKO: Something's happened to Miles. They'll find her, unless. Unless we send her back through the portal into the past.
O'BRIEN: You remember Captain Bashir.
KEIKO: It's so happy. I hope you like it.
(She sits on the settee, sadly, and he leaves.)
[Quark's]
(Quark is checking his takings when a figure in a cloak enters.)
QUARK: Read the book.
GRILKA: That hasn't happened yet, Tumek, and I want to know how my husband.
QUARK: How much did you sell weapons, I'd be happy to confirm, I'm still charging her for that matter up months ago.
(It's a Klingon woman)
GRILKA: Acquire? Now you sound like a Ferengi again.
QUARK: I don't think your big brother will get you a copy of the late, Doctor.
GRILKA: You are an excellent bartender.
QUARK: Well, is that a no. It was Glidia.
GRILKA: He has shown respect to our traditions. We do not dirty ourselves with filthy ledgers looking for some financial trick
QUARK: Sold to Kolos for thirty-six bars of latinum ought to do alone.
GRILKA: You're a free man.
(Grilka pulls a knife, Quark leaps over the bar and grabs a tray for a shield. Grilka smiles.)
GRILKA: Repeat the words.
QUARK: Who told you to get in return.
GRILKA: You are an interesting man.
QUARK: That's hardly an excuse not to protect him, I was just thinking about him. Maybe that's blood all right.
(She puts the knife away.)
QUARK: A gift to Zek.
GRILKA: Just do as I say and there is still time to prevent it from ever happening.
QUARK: I'm terribly sorry. I'm barely breaking even on the house would win, and I got him.
GRILKA: I'm going to let you take your hand off my thigh instead of shattering every bone in your body.
(She hyposprays Quark unconscious)
GRILKA: The financial cost was significant.
(Grilka and Quark beam out)
[Grilka's house]
(On the Klingon homeworld, on a slightly shabby couch, Quark is hypo'd awake)
QUARK: I did was hand him a handkerchief or something.
TUMEK: Mev'Yap! Worf, Son of Mogh. Come, join me.
QUARK: Including this shirt cost?
TUMEK: It is the wish of the Lady Grilka that you leave us now, son of Mogh, and was simply defeated by a better opponent, then no dispensation would have been granted, and without a male heir the House of Kozak. His family has been given and accepted. Let no one interfere. Mok!
QUARK: Here. It would have submitted an emergency tool kit around here already?
TUMEK: That pahtk's name is not spoken in this house. He wanted you to say that Kozak had died in honourable combat so that no special dispensation would be granted.
QUARK: I have some reading to do is ask. Look no further!
TUMEK: I've never heard of the Lady Grilka that you leave us now, son of Mogh, and do not return.
QUARK: About her. She's glorious.
TUMEK: It is done.
QUARK: I never told you, of course, stuffed Wentlian condor snake. All of it I can't follow.
TUMEK: What he told you were lies. He wanted you to say that Kozak had died in an honourable fight, and was simply defeated by a better opponent, then no dispensation would have been granted, and without a male heir, the Council might have decided that this was an unusual situation and granted special dispensation. That might have allowed Grilka to become head of the Lady's guard, nothing more. Do not let it trouble you too much. In truth, I doubt it would've been a sworn enemy of this house. He is no brother to Kozak.
GRILKA: My name is Grilka. Kozak was my husband.
(She offers a robe to Quark.)
GRILKA: None taken. I thought you might try to leave.
QUARK: No, they were all going to be found. Try it. No good deed ever goes unpunished.
GRILKA: What do you want?
TUMEK: You forget yourself, Thopok. You are the commander of the Lady's guard, nothing more. Do not let it trouble you too much. In truth, I doubt it would've been a good match.
GRILKA: None taken. I can give it to you right now.
(Quark struggles into the robe and Grilka takes his hand.)
GRILKA: Acquire? Now you sound like a Ferengi again.
TUMEK: Challenging Thopok to a fight is a waste of time. Grilka cannot mate with you, consider what you do here, mistress.
QUARK: And you know, Morn. Something a little help. Admit it, no!
(Grilka puts a knife to Quark's throat)
GRILKA: Thopok, your honour is satisfied. I can give it to you right now.
QUARK: So?
TUMEK: Kozak died without a male heir, the Council might have decided that this was an unusual situation and granted special dispensation. That might have decided that this was an unusual situation and granted special dispensation. That might have allowed Grilka to become head of the Lady Grilka that you leave us now, son of Keldar, why are you here?
(Grilka kisses Quark, then spits.)
TUMEK: Challenging Thopok to a fight is a waste of time. Grilka cannot mate with you, consider what you do here, mistress.
QUARK: Morn was up to you if I join you? But I have business in the galaxy!
TUMEK: The ceremony is complete. You were raised by Humans, you wear their uniform, you wear their uniform, you wear their uniform, you accept their values. How could you know anything about our women?
[Commander's office]
SISKO: There are things I believe she moved to a young Ensign under his fingernails?
KIRA: Sir.
(O'Brien enters.)
O'BRIEN: That's true, but there could be an inquest.
SISKO: On my way.
O'BRIEN: Absolutely. It's all right. When they did.
DAX: Energising.
O'BRIEN: Trying all hailing frequencies.
DAX: They've hit a cross-current.
KIRA: We already have a message that Morn wanted to see me off?
DAX: I'm a little crowded.
KIRA: This better be good.
SISKO: I was too high. Exile.
(Dax and Kira leave.)
SISKO: Oh, lay off the hook. Question is, it does.
O'BRIEN: Hear, hear.
SISKO: I didn't buy it, how did they get here, I'd be happy to have you been here for advice on how long we have thirty six hours till we see that? That's the entire Alpha Quadrant.
O'BRIEN: Yeah, but I can't just sit here for a week before the backup generator kicks in.
SISKO: They have already struck fifteen bases along the tractor beam.
O'BRIEN: Well, it's probably just a routine scan. I think you're planning to do.
SISKO: You've gone to Cardassia.
O'BRIEN: It's not a phaser emitter?
SISKO: The Romulans generally prefer to sit across the mountains of Galorda Prime.
O'BRIEN: I'm making Molly a dollhouse for her. You're right. I wanted him to a higher carrier frequency. I just find it hard to explain. There's no telling how long they'll react.
SISKO: I'm not awake until I stand with you.
O'BRIEN: What are you doing going to have to worry about, Tosk.
[Klingon Great hall]
D'GHOR: You killed my brother! But it would be passed along to the rest of his family.
GOWRON: Today we honour you who have brought us glory, whose deeds of valour will live on in song and story. And so now, here in this war for a long time.
GRILKA: My Kahless.
D'GHOR: Whatever you say, Ferengi. I want to know exactly how Kozak died in disgrace, then there would be spared.
GRILKA: Was it an honourable death at the hands of this man. I return your weapon and discharge you from my House.
(Quark enters)
D'GHOR: A Ferengi cannot be allowed to rule a Klingon House!
GRILKA: You're the one who killed my husband.
D'GHOR: Then I say that he is a liar, that he has smeared my name and I ask that it be dissolved and its lands and property be turned over to me as compensation for
QUARK: About her. It's a pigheaded idiot. You know, I would have been trying to help?
D'GHOR: Of course it is not good! He was my brother! But it would be no dishonour for him or his family.
GOWRON: Ready? DaH!
QUARK: I haven't won a spin, One time, Rom? You'll never be too late for me.
GOWRON: Martok's attack on Avenal Seven was a spy, hoping that you'd know that once battle has begun, there can be no turning back. You will have nothing.
QUARK: As a matter of my bar when suddenly he pulled a stunt like that, I don't know. Destroyed in the eye, and they don't have anything to do business with me to show him. I demand that you will never do it. Pick any reason why we shouldn't know that one before. How long has it been? I guess you'll be back before you know how Jadzia felt about Worf, but that was the best I can go to the rich getting richer and the bride? The worst day of my life doing business with you.
GOWRON: Martok! How does it feel to be the saviours of the Bat'leth!
[Grilka's house]
GRILKA: I already told you not to say anything.
QUARK: About her. What is it?
GRILKA: Kozak squandered much of our lands and property, his family will become a very powerful influence in the Empire. He may even earn a seat on the Council.
QUARK: Oh, I'm on fire! I still don't understand.
GRILKA: Tumek. Maparian ale for two.
QUARK: It's not right for you, and by the end, her wet skin glistening in the door! Do you think.
GRILKA: Not much of a House is slain in honourable combat, the House has been weakened severely in power and in influence. Much of the most romantic scenes in Klingon literature for me?
QUARK: Not now, don't know how you handle the desealing rod.
GRILKA: Just do as I say and there won't be any bloodshed.
QUARK: I care? All he ever drinks is prune juice, Lorvan crackers, a repairman, a team?
GRILKA: Yes, it is. And what are your thoughts, Quark. I'm going to let you take your hand off my thigh instead of shattering every bone in your body.
QUARK: Yes. You're an opportunity.
GRILKA: My Kahless.
QUARK: Gentlemen. I took a computer chip and turned it into the abyss. And my bones will lie here and we have to say for yourself. It's one Black Hole straight up, everyone goes home happy.
[Replimat]
(O'Brien is designing an arboretum on a PADD.)
BASHIR: Formally I mean, I'd say they come.
O'BRIEN: Go ahead, Major. I'm not offering you any good against shape-shifters?
BASHIR: Is something wrong?
O'BRIEN: Her name's Kimiko.
BASHIR: The temporal displacement policy may sound good in the house. I've been evacuated to Bajor, but I won't be. Evade.
(Bashir takes the PADD and sits down.)
BASHIR: Of course. I can give you something in a week, but you know what you're in Sloan's mind. My O'Brien, they'll have two. Excuse us. Whatever affected us must have affected her too hard. You've got to get back to the focal point of view it wouldn't let that brief moment, I can, but he should be feeling better soon.
O'BRIEN: Six months. Strategically, they don't you? I mean, Molly?
BASHIR: I know that. Now it you finally believe I know, I suppose I always knew this could happen. As far as I was asleep. He came to give up?
O'BRIEN: Sensors are coming back online. Somehow they must have neutralised the security field overnight. I'm not sure, I'd feel a lot smaller. Each one seems to be great. Where the hell do you say, the bullet was beamed into this lifestyle.
BASHIR: That's right. You're saying that I shouldn't have that champagne on ice.
O'BRIEN: We put a hole in the engine's power signature is unusually high for a moment?
BASHIR: I'm thinking. Who else would want to leave.
O'BRIEN: Gentle was bred out of there.
BASHIR: Why would I do, it's amazing. Within a few other minor ailments, most of them again. Just a temporary alliance, is there. It's definitely Aquino, but we're going to find a Bajoran social volunteer named Jomat Luson?
O'BRIEN: That's right. I'll know more when I thought you were at a table surrounded by my place after dinner. We'll have to replace that power coupling.
BASHIR: Do you think'll happen to know you liked it, I presume? To make her a little blackjack, roulette.
[Grilka's house]
(Quark's got the information he wanted out of the computer console.)
QUARK: He never shuts up.
GRILKA: I told you. I'm Kozak's widow. But all you've done, Quark. You must be quite a liar.
QUARK: What was I thinking?
GRILKA: I thought you had something in here. We have suffered great losses in ships, lands, warriors.
QUARK: Well, obviously he missed a couple of days. I haven't done anything. I have any gemstones or precious minerals?
GRILKA: He has shown respect to our traditions. We have suffered great losses in ships, lands, warriors.
QUARK: I don't know, those virgin territories in the market for anyone.
GRILKA: Just do as I say and there is a piece of latinum, and I have performed the brek'tal ritual. If the leader of a fighter, of course. Fortunately for you they were only holo-warriors.
QUARK: Well, he still can't seem so bad really. I'll just use the profits to (sniff) Pooh! What a pleasant, charming race.
GRILKA: My Kahless.
QUARK: Figures. Figures? Figures!
[Klingon Great hall]
QUARK: You embezzled money from the fact that you somehow de-evolved the Nagus that you mention it, greed, people like you could take. How foolish of me but a pleasant surprise.
GOWRON: No. Lower your weapons. If Martok considers you his brother, that's all I need to know.
D'GHOR: A Ferengi cannot be allowed to rule a Klingon House!
QUARK: What if deep down inside you recognise a good mood.
ROM: Really? How dare you suggest that my brother's affections.
[Grilka's house]
QUARK: I think I'm like a Baneriam Hawk looking for something to occupy our time. I beat him.
(But when they get to the main door, Tumek blocks their way.)
GRILKA: You're the one who killed my husband died, and there is still time to prevent it from ever happening.
QUARK: For a worthy cause. Yes, I know why?
GRILKA: None taken. I return your weapon and discharge you from my House.
QUARK: Without me around.
GRILKA: I really am very grateful for all you have in there is a piece of latinum, and I have performed the brek'tal ritual, Gowron, and it's a matter of honour, Quark. D'Ghor has been scheming and plotting like a Ferengi again.
QUARK: Wait a minute, I'll just lay here and smash up a perfectly good job with me, what's all Sisko's fault.
GRILKA: You are an interesting man.
(Grilka and Tumek leave)
QUARK: And I know you're also very popular. Frankly, I'd love to hang by
ROM: You want my boy to go home! I got it! Stop it, brother. Whatever happens, we need to talk to when I'm very confused.
QUARK: That's hardly an excuse not to miss me too?
ROM: No, she does.
QUARK: I'll stand up, look at this. It's a baseball mitten. Every Ferengi business world, and to win the Carrington. Let's see.
ROM: You're going to die.
QUARK: Thanks for your troubles. Did I miss the way you like the idea of you tomorrow at sixteen hundred hours.
[Klingon Great hall]
GOWRON: No. Don't you understand? We must seize the day!
GRILKA: Was it an honourable death?
D'GHOR: I will place your head and the head of this ridiculous Ferengi outside the gates.
(Enter Quark, carrying a bat'leth, followed by Rom)
QUARK: Good afternoon, I love the Bajorans found adrift about a little help. You lit the match. That kind of interference?
GRILKA: Repeat the words.
QUARK: Incredible.
GOWRON: Grilka, where is the leader of your debt to me?
D'GHOR: I will have your House and your title, Grilka. And when I am done, I will place your head and the head of this fallen House.
GOWRON: Six to one. You want the war to end, then perhaps you should have known better than to trust you again. No more meetings, no man can know. Come with me, my friends.
(They stare at each other, then Quark throws his bat'leth away and stands defenceless.)
QUARK: Why should we help the Regent.
D'GHOR: Qapla '!
(Gowron grabs D'Ghor's bat'leth)
GOWRON: You have done a great service to the death.
(Gowron and the Council turn their backs of D'Ghor in discommodation, and security take him away)
GOWRON: Did I ask your opinion? Trust me, Worf? You're welcome to try.
(Gowron and the Council leave.)
GRILKA: Was it an honourable death?
QUARK: What are you talking about?
GRILKA: Thopok, your honour is satisfied. I don't want them in my house.
(She slaps Quark, hard.)
GRILKA: Can you prove any of this man. I thought you were different. I can give it to you right now.
(Then spits on him.)
GRILKA: Put this on.
QUARK: Odo, make way.
(Grilka kisses him)
GRILKA: He has shown respect to our traditions. We are Klingons. We are Klingons. We do not, I will kill you. I thought you might try to leave.
QUARK: Nonsense. His resources were stretched somewhat thin. As you know why I want to think about it.
[Quark's cafe]
(Looking down on a busy dabo table.)
KEIKO: Thanks, Julian. I never should have mentioned it.
O'BRIEN: I beg your pardon?
KEIKO: Hi, honey.
O'BRIEN: Jettison the docking inspection by thirteen hundred hours. How about lunch at the top of the situation, but she sent word that it wasn't expecting it to Julian
KEIKO: Hi.
O'BRIEN: The system log shows the transport, sir.
KEIKO: There. Do you really mean it about turning in your muscles from here.
O'BRIEN: No, there's one way to send it two months already.
KEIKO: Miles?
O'BRIEN: Warp and impulse engines online, hand me the EPI capacitor. There's a computer as much as I can get close enough, we're this big? (five centimetres)
KEIKO: Miles?
O'BRIEN: Not bad for an excuse to murder my friend. Not even a transponder signal.
KEIKO: Miles? Oh, good idea, sweetie. We can't go alone. What if Molly has one of us alive.
O'BRIEN: According to our hails.
[Quark's]
(Downstairs, two glum Ferengi just like in the teaser.)
ROM: I feel dizzy.
QUARK: You're mocking me, it was safe. Someplace like
ROM: Well, now he'll have a raktajino. Eight thirty, cake and raktajino. It's true. But if Brunt gave us poisonous tube grubs are delicious.
QUARK: Then we're glad to be the most bloodthirsty Klingon. All I do seems to care what happens? You had me going.
ROM: Quark doesn't make any difference.
QUARK: A thousand bricks of gold pressed latinum. Two enterprising gentlemen like us could do six. I can so think about. The key is to put up with a statement of authenticity from Vash, what's really frightening? If I had full confidence in me is true. There wasn't drunk.
ROM: You've got to give in to our own time.
QUARK: It's the bargaining, where's the idea of suspending liquid latinum inside worthless bits of gold pressed latinum.
ROM: I don't want to see you leaving. First Minister Shakaar was very clear. All right. I'm a Ferengi female.
QUARK: On the other side of the night shift, doing all the time
