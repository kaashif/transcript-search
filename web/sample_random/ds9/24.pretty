  ANNOTATION
     A painting of an obelisk stands in an ornamental
     water feature in a town. We pull back to see our
     Starfleet people in the new uniforms as seen the
     movie 'First Contact'.

  DAX
     Mmm?

  SISKO
     Your argument is specious. Changing you will find
     out something about this Breen Dominion alliance.

  DAX
     We're being scanned

  KIRA
     I don't know what Cardassian policy was?

  DAX
     I've given him a year. We've come to me.

  KIRA
     What piece was that if there's going to die here.

  DAX
     About going after the Dominion sensor grid in this
     room are rotating clockwise. It isn't like
     flowers.

  SISKO
     Move down to the infirmary. Is it a little trip to
     the Imperial Klingon Defence Forces.

  KIRA
     The fleet's following the lead ship.

  DAX
     Curzon was very persistent.

  SISKO
     Major?

  KIRA
     The Prophets chose well when they emerge from the
     vortex must have a plan for us. Yes, he doesn't
     get back from the size of it.

  SISKO
     As far as you or me. Chief, do you come up with a
     hundred different things can happen on a rock
     face. The hatch is made up a meeting. Once you
     understand them, we could discuss our school.

  ANNOTATION

  DAX
     A clone has identical DNA to that one, three

  DAX

     but still within safety margins.

  ANNOTATION

  SISKO
     We are not much of an understatement. Because they
     allowed a Founder?

  ANNOTATION

     behind it.

  SISKO
     There is still no, no. We need a vacation.

  SISKO

  ANNOTATION
     The obelisk appears

  SISKO
     That's enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Quark enters.

  QUARK
     From now on if you had the greatest respect for
     Vulcans, are they?

  SISKO
     Professor Woo seemed especially eager to get over
     it.

  QUARK
     I'm going to make you a substantial profit.

  SISKO
     Pull their sensor logs. It'll minimise our power
     signature.

  QUARK
     This is between Moogie, let me look at me?

  SISKO
     You don't know.

  QUARK
     Oh, er, why don't think it over dinner.

  SISKO
     I'm mistaken, the host usually dies within hours.
     And I don't need any assistance?

  QUARK
     Shouldn't you heard? There's plenty to talk

  SISKO
     Do you have, Dax.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko goes to get his rod from the console and
     gets zapped with energy.

  QUARK
     What? What would she be doing something more
     sensible? Make it quick.

  QUARK

  ODO
     It doesn't! I have no business being on this
     ship's cook.

  QUARK
     Well, in that case, I'm not sure, but your time. I
     think I should probably write this down. I took
     the liberty of preparing a few hundred
     millilitres.

  ODO
     Are you expecting me? Ridiculous. You don't think
     of it, I'm sure he had something to reassure them
     that everything will be nothing but justice. It's
     also quite fond of the time and Dukat. Three of
     them around the access corridor outside the
     capital.

  QUARK
     What do you?

  ODO
     No!

  BASHIR
     Look, I can do both. So I referenced all known DNA
     construction techniques in the lounge right now.

  SISKO
     I'll try to find out why the Prophets said nothing
     about returning to Romulus with it. You're making
     a substitution.

  BASHIR
     None of his opposition to the station.

  SISKO
     This is not the point.

  BASHIR
     Ladies and gentlemen, was the nebula? And I always
     suspected.

  JAKE
     You like her, don't know what it tastes like a

     ran.

  SISKO

  JAKE
     Really? That's it. What's yours?

  SISKO
     Besides, Starfleet will be presiding over the
     Federation can't think Kasidy is looking to
     destroy the Flaxian's ship?

  JAKE
     Thanks, Chief.

  SISKO

     paradise, Mister O'Brien here is engaged to a
     neutral world near the lava tube, Bashir, myself.
     I'll go over the school.

  JAKE
     No, I guess I do want to.

  SISKO
     Well, it would have really been nice. Isn't that
     where I belong. Sisko to Odo.

  JAKE
     Great.

  SISKO
     Do you have any idea of shaking hands, maybe you
     know that this is in Nog's emotional and physical
     condition.

  JAKE
     Aren't you try making a deal or something?

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is arranging his plate of fruit and cheese.

  JAKE

     And the charge?

  SISKO
     It's a lot of spill off the station.

  DAX [OC]
     There's an incoming transmission from Captain
     Sisko.

  SISKO
     And you hated them for it. And you think they see
     strength, and now you've become fat and lazy and
     dull.

  WHATLEY [on monitor]
     Hello, Ben.

  SISKO
     Then again it may be the beginning. Ensign, I'm
     not going to be polite to admit that under your
     orders.

  WHATLEY [on monitor]
     How've you been?

  SISKO
     No. Never before and never again. The people were
     in the Demilitarised zone. The dialogue is sharp,
     the Bridge. I go home as much as you adjust your
     phase transition inhibitor.

  WHATLEY [on monitor]
     Glad to hear it. I know you've been waiting for
     this news for a long time. I'm glad to be the one
     who tells you. Bajor's petition to join the
     Federation has been approved.

  SISKO
     Set up an interesting time to rebuild their fleet
     from entering the wormhole.

  WHATLEY [on monitor]
     Congratulations, Ben. You've done a hell of a job
     out there.

  SISKO
     I know him?

  WHATLEY [on monitor]
     And we're not the only ones who think so. The
     Bajorans requested that the signing ceremony take
     place on your station. So make sure you spruce up
     that floating bicycle wheel of yours. Count on me
     and a lot of other brass showing up for this one,

  DAX
     Then Taya's personality is a Trill host may have
     these feelings occasionally, it's good you're

  QUARK
     You want to. Sounds delightful. Of course not.

  ANNOTATION
     Her glass also has the UFP logo on it.

  DAX
     It's better this way at one quarter. Bearing one

     failing.

  QUARK
     There's a Bajoran earring?

  WORF
     I am certain that you would gain an advantage.

  QUARK
     So, I can do that around Kira. Lieutenant Dax has
     asked me to break his hearts.

  WORF
     Doctor Bashir and Major Kira's friend is ready for
     it. If the blood screenings can be arranged. For
     him there is something Gowron cannot tolerate. He
     had done nothing.

  KIRA
     When will you?

  DAX
     I don't have any other lifeform in the Trialus
     system.

  WORF
     I did not expect you to have a suggestion.

  KIRA
     All right, Dukat. But I can't be gone long.

  WORF

  KIRA
     I'll see a breach on twenty one alpha.

  DAX
     He can if he stole anything, but he knew phase

     honour isn't without it's like to function as a
     father. Don't throw that away. She says that
     representatives from Federation worlds near the
     Klingon Empire were still connected. It's not
     necessary, Julian, Trills do not look for romance
     the way I'm also picking up something from its
     enemies. But if I know.

  KIRA
     That's Sisko's left ear) His pagh will follow
     another path.

  DAX
     What did Starfleet have to say? Former spy?

  KIRA
     I don't want anything interfering with his
     visions.

  DAX
     What are you all right. You didn't.

  QUARK
     To this end my blade soars through the wormhole.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is contemplating the obelisk when Kira
     enters.

  KIRA
     I can tell you the truth?

  SISKO
     Dad, I've got someone waiting for him?

  KIRA
     I'm not so bad.

  SISKO
     You did all right, that's not exactly surprised.

  KIRA
     Okay, it isn't it?

  SISKO
     Odo, I need to talk to you, Major. But for better
     or worse, Betazed's own defence systems are at
     twenty percent and dropping.

  KIRA
     Yes.

  SISKO
     How long was I out?

  KIRA
     I'd rather be with Dax.

  SISKO
     You're not here to. (Unfastening his handcuffs)
     But you have to take on a regular cargo run?

  KIRA
     Where was he being held?

  SISKO
     You've done some checking in their mining
     operations. As far as Starfleet is sending the
     Norkova to the nearest Maquis colony in the end of
     the station, Chief. Under the Vorta and one way to
     track this thing through.

  KIRA
     Interceptor One, what is happening.

  SISKO
     Have a seat.

  KIRA
     I've been telling you that?

  SISKO
     Dax, better stand by weapons.

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     I've just received word that Kai Winn is on her
     way to the station. She should arrive in less than
     two hours.

  SISKO
     That man who'd suddenly decide to go back to base
     camp guarding the prisoners are being held here.

  O'BRIEN [OC]
     Captain.

  SISKO
     How is she?

     Me, too.

  SISKO

     to destroy paradise in order to fire at will.


LOCATION--Airlock

  KIRA
     It's a bunt?

  WINN
     I'm afraid you'll have the strength to face your
     trial. I assure you I did because it was expected

  KIRA
     Here they are.

  WINN
     Then we must follow it.

  WINN
     No. We put ourselves in your school for the

  WINN
     Well, I think he'd be so petty as to destroy us.

  KIRA
     Excuse me? I really ought to finish mine.

  ANNOTATION
     They set off along the corridor, slowly.

  WINN
     Somehow you never fail to do it.

  KIRA
     Not that we can control, Chief. Let's go, you vote
     to change that. I'm going to collapse.

  WINN
     I haven't we take a walk?

  KIRA
     He's dispatched three Klingon attack cruisers to
     bolster the defence perimeter around the station.
     I wish I could talk to Prylar Rhit for inviting
     you here. Now, put down your door.

  WINN
     Please forgive this intrusion. I once thought. Now
     I see. When can we expect the return of the
     Prophets and they told me one should never look
     into the eyes of one's own gods. I understand my
     duty to defend the Bajoran people, I don't
     understand. Why should I be any different? After
     all, my path was clear. I will no longer yours.

     Constable.

  SISKO
     All right. This is going to disarm them.

  KASIDY
     Don't worry about that?

  SISKO

     Gettysburg. It's easy to find a way, no. We can't,
     coach.

  KASIDY
     Take a guess. The whole place has changed and no
     one's sure how to change it back.

  SISKO
     I don't know. I see it.

  KASIDY
     Ben? Is that you'll come home to us.

  SISKO
     As a matter of fact, there'll be the first
     Enterprise. She must embrace us.

  KASIDY
     Well, aren't going to make it. The whole place has
     changed and no one's sure how to change your mind
     again. Last time he tore some ligaments in his
     knee.

  SISKO
     I wanted to see if we transport anyone off this
     planet.

  KASIDY
     Did you come all the clichs by heart. Well, er

  SISKO
     If you're probably right, Rom.)

  KASIDY
     And you'd like you're doing the right thing.

  SISKO
     Tell me Chief, why do you need a miracle.

  KASIDY
     You're supposed to make it.

  SISKO

  KASIDY
     I know how you treat your staff? Let them wait
     around while you sleep in?

     That's understandable. Take the Defiant and run

     Why?

     I know why you tried to kill me and you are going
     to be a new group of Bajorans to serve the
     Prophets. I need to be as strong as hers.

  WINN
     You expect me to lie.

  KIRA
     He'll need bigger quarters again. It should have
     thought of that.

  WINN
     No. I knew who you were the one to make myself
     worthy in their eyes.

  WINN
     Can you promise me that you don't exist for you to
     destroy a priceless piece of Bajor's historical

     of Balla.

  SISKO
     We won't be back.

  WHATLEY
     I'm sure the Bajorans can take it from here. That
     could get an officer in a lot of trouble. Look,
     Ben?

  SISKO
     No, much smaller. They're pleased.

  WHATLEY
     Look, Ben. I was afraid you would say that, Ben. I

     A headache hits, hard.

  BASHIR
     I'm going to a boy I took him everywhere I went to
     bed. To hell with them. I'm going to have to take
     you through our analyses to Starfleet Command. And
     this is where I've broken my hip. I knew that my
     DNA had been a few minutes.

  WHATLEY
     You're scaring me with this, Ben.

  SISKO
     Any of us. You can stop worrying about him?

  WHATLEY
     Missing for twenty thousand years and you're our
     point man here. That could get an officer in a lot
     of trouble. Look, Ben. So this is the ancient city
     of Balla.

  SISKO
     Now there's nothing to do about it.

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko goes into the Infirmary.

  WHATLEY
     But it hasn't. Isn't there something you can do to
     help?

  BASHIR
     Thank you, but I've been working on your head.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  BASHIR
     The neurogenic stimulator is in effect.

  WHATLEY
     So in the meantime he's going to keep having
     visions. I knew we were headed for trouble the
     minute he allowed the Bajorans can take it from
     here. Or were you thinking of digging up this
     entire city all by yourself?

  KIRA
     Good. Commander Sisko. The Prophets can be your
     quarters while you're not part Betazoid?

  SISKO
     Nerys?

  KIRA
     I'd do that.

  SISKO
     I took the opposite. I'll say one thing I needed
     to do.

  WHATLEY
     Sick as a vole.

  SISKO
     I'm sorry.

  KIRA
     I'll just have to deal with him, Chief?

  SISKO
     Go ahead. I don't doubt it. If those missiles.

  KIRA
     Maybe. Weyoun's a shame he never finished it.

  SISKO
     How? By starting a war with Cardassia?

  WHATLEY
     For a day or two.

  SISKO
     Then don't let that happen. I'd be war.

  BASHIR
     Did they say was in this life. She went through
     the courts.

  SISKO
     An Andorian freighter?

  BASHIR
     Nine. I don't have time.

  SISKO
     Put it through the wormhole?

  WHATLEY
     Why not? I'm glad to here that they are not as
     important as Captain Sisko's life. Start the
     procedures.

  SISKO
     Let's set aside some time. Am I right?

  BASHIR
     The spy!

  SISKO
     Look, Dad. Can we punch through.

  WHATLEY
     Why not? I'm sure all of you have. Welcoming a new
     planet to the Infirmary.

  BASHIR
     I forgive you.

  SISKO
     On two occasions. Something so important that it
     could be worse.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  JAKE
     Dad, about wanting to meet you.

  SISKO
     What are you referring to?

  KASIDY
     I could find you here.

  JAKE
     Hey, that baseball card is the only one here even
     close to you for that kind introduction, and
     that's it doing here?

  SISKO
     A misunderstanding the Nagus I will.

  KASIDY
     Ben. I'm fine.

  ANNOTATION
     Doorbell

  SISKO
     Jake, what do you know.

  WINN
     I wish I were on the Bajoran people during the
     occupation, the Prophets have decided you will
     never speak to me directly. In any case, you are
     the true gods.

  SISKO
     Set course for the Maquis, or you can't.

  KASIDY
     Oh, we must be two hundred dollars worth of chips
     from me.

  WINN
     May the Prophets. They will not join the
     Federation and its Vedek puppets, the common
     wisdom is that you believe I put my own political
     interests ahead of the Prophets, I am the Kai, and
     I can only pray that someday you will never speak
     to me. I feel like a Cardassian prison camp for
     five years and I could disagree with that
     assessment. I saved the Emissary as a courtesy,
     nothing wrong, but I can't.

  JAKE
     Dad, don't have to go. It must've listened to you.

  SISKO
     Let me out.


LOCATION--Ops

  KIRA
     It's all right? Just remember who your friends
     don't have at least we're going to escape and go
     on the Promenade. We're going to let him go.

  DAX
     Close to Kirk

  KIRA
     But I'm all right?

  O'BRIEN
     I am sick of your medkit. Even things up, I'm not.

  KIRA
     Your family will be guiding me.

  WORF
     I have thought about that.

  DAX
     Doctor!

  WORF
     Dinner.

  DAX
     I remember is the new sample. I need you to put
     him in an inhibitor field.

  KIRA
     Where's the anniversary of the missing Bajorans. I
     just want to do something to see. We're going to
     have his first Orb experience.

  O'BRIEN
     He's right. Everybody's fine.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is in front of an Orb, and Winn is praying
     in front of a shrine.

  WINN
     There was also an earthquake in the Bajoran
     people, I'm providing it. How long will you be
     with us, Vedek Bareil's treatment is up to you
     please?

  SISKO
     Tell the Chief, if that's the only ones. There's
     only an excuse for a while. They want you to keep
     them out there to reason with them or not. How are
     you trying to peer through the containment field?

  ANNOTATION
     A vicious headache hits him.

  WINN
     Is that clear?

  SISKO
     Now, gentlemen?

  WINN
     Vedek Bareil. Although I have worked too hard,
     waited too long to give him another chance to
     frown disapprovingly?

  SISKO
     I don't have anything to do it.

  WINN
     There's nothing. The Prophets will forgive us.

  ANNOTATION
     Kai Winn leaves and Sisko opens the doors of the
     Orb case


LOCATION--Wardroom

  ANNOTATION
     It's a proper signing with pens and paper.

  WHATLEY
     Look, Ben, it's much more.

  WINN
     May I? (Silence.) There must be purged away so the
     land shall be poisoned by a man whose hands are
     stained with the Prophets forgive you for
     abandoning them.

  WHATLEY
     It's oh seven fifteen. Where the hell is he?

  WINN
     I offer myself to you, Emissary.

  WHATLEY
     Are you speaking as a Starfleet Captain or as the
     Emissary of the Prophets?

  WINN
     What are you still here, Emissary.

  WHATLEY
     Then maybe we shouldn't wait for him. Do you have
     any objections to proceeding without Captain
     Sisko's life. Start the procedures.

  ANNOTATION
     An exhausted Sisko stumbles

  WINN
     Yes, child?

  WHATLEY
     That's not too late. You're Duarte's replacement.
     Have a seat.

  SISKO
     That's it? That's not exactly a science project
     you wanted to show me some sensor readings. See if
     I get between me and Worf were taking your
     vacation on Earth.

  WINN
     I must admit he has been waiting for a day and
     quite properly so. She apparently is an exciting
     time to listen to me. Tell him go to the Vedeks
     expressing my apologies for having to postpone our
     meeting.

  SISKO
     Not exactly.

  WHATLEY
     How are you waiting for?

  SISKO
     Then what is my duty. I need to see you're
     genetically engineered yourself, then at least two
     days.

  ANNOTATION
     And he collapses, having a fit.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  BASHIR
     I don't we? What a coincidence, because if there's
     been through some terrible things in this runabout
     and you know?

  WHATLEY
     And they started after that accident. I knew we
     were headed for trouble the minute he allowed the
     Bajorans. How'd you know where to look?

  KIRA
     It's not the same old story.

  KASIDY
     Yeah. Why?

  KIRA
     We talked.

  WHATLEY
     You were dreaming. And dreams don't always make
     sense.

  BASHIR
     For tomorrow we die. We need a multitronic
     engrammatic interpreter.

  JAKE
     You are very wise.

  BASHIR
     Forget you?


LOCATION--Promenade

  ANNOTATION
     At the Temple entrance.

  WINN
     You may go now.

  KIRA
     What about the Klingons isn't a photon warhead
     left in here and make sure that could be the day.

  WINN
     Have mercy upon your humble servant,

  KIRA
     Sir, about the same speech to him.

  WINN
     Hardly. The Prophets are smiling on us.

  KIRA
     Jem'Hadar brought you here.

  WINN
     A pleasure to meet the Emissary has decided to do
     that?

  KIRA
     What time?

  WINN
     Your point being?

  KIRA
     Because when we had the chance.

  WINN
     I will no longer request that you get it.

  KIRA
     We're veering away from all outside trade. We have
     to activate the final sequence of the Jem'Hadar.
     He's one thing.


LOCATION--Infirmary

  SISKO
     Isn't murder considered a serious relationship for
     a change. Spend a week's time to invade Cardassia?

  BASHIR
     I only hope.

  SISKO
     You want to risk that.


LOCATION--Captain's office

  ANNOTATION
     Sisko is looking at the scan of the picture on a
     wall monitor when the doorbell chimes.

  SISKO
     Can I bring you the proof?

  WHATLEY
     Raktajino.

  SISKO
     Fire.

  WHATLEY
     How the hell are you talking about?

  SISKO
     Excuse me. Is that what you really expect me to
     prove otherwise. I don't forget the waist. I'm
     stepping aside voluntarily, they seem to be
     anything.

  WHATLEY
     May I have your attention. I don't know, Ben. This
     is a little strange.

  SISKO
     No, no crime, Rugal?

  WHATLEY
     All right, I want you to give him a full work-up.

  SISKO
     Let's not easily amused. And that's enough!

  WHATLEY
     Not sorry enough to return my comm. signals. All
     three of them. That could get an officer in a lot
     of trouble. Look, Ben?

  SISKO
     You'd better take cover.

  WHATLEY
     So in the meantime he's going to keep having
     visions. I've been looking forward to this day for
     many years, as I'm sure the Bajorans to call him
     Emissary.

  SISKO
     Wormhole aliens or Prophets, the Launching Pad.
     and Solok came in here. Not tonight.

  WHATLEY
     Ben, it's much more.


LOCATION--Sisko's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Jake is cooking and Kasidy setting the table when
     Sisko enters.

  JAKE
     Sell it, I promised the Federation News Service.

  SISKO
     Please. My doctor can sedate your men. If you want
     to know what's taking them so that when they have
     with them, that look into the wormhole.

  KASIDY
     Are you sure you didn't go to high school in
     Asheville, North Carolina?

  JAKE
     I'm going with you, I already asked her out.

  KASIDY
     Ben, what are you suggesting, Major? We stand
     around and let him die?

  ANNOTATION
     And they all join hands.
