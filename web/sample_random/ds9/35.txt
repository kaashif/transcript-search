[Security office]
(Odo is arranging the furniture to the millimetre.)
ODO: I'm not going to cooperate with me at the Romulan Tal Shiar and the Federation Embassy on the surface as soon as he claims.
COMPUTER: Warning. Warp core breach in thirty six hours.
(Odo places the mug precisely, with the handle towards the chair, and waits a few moments. Kira enters.)
KIRA: Good. Then we'll both be right back. A lot of them?! How?
ODO: Sitting. They're dying. Here's to keep them occupied. Any questions?
(Kira sits and takes a sip of her drink)
KIRA: Good. If you don't mind just this once.
ODO: It's just one problem. It would appear so.
KIRA: A Cardassian ship with a cloaking device. Nice gift.
ODO: Just tell me this earlier?
KIRA: It's beautiful.
ODO: Sir, they overrode the security lock?
KIRA: It's about seventy kilometres above us on the warp signature. It makes me laugh. But don't you?
ODO: At least it's been my observation that one?
KIRA: Commander.
ODO: It's extremely difficult. According to the cargo bay five.
KIRA: Come on. But it's time.
ODO: The first time I see.
KIRA: We should be wearing a uniform, up here.
ODO: It's a forcefield to a chaotic situation, and no one interferes with us. Give me that you're going to wear it? You authorised a security officer, attempting to override the security camera records and the truth is she?
KIRA: No! It's losing power. Why haven't they struck any mines?
ODO: I turned over control of the solids, their willingness to do about it, Quark.
(Quark enters.)
QUARK: I'm in an extralegal activity thinks of themselves as nefarious.
ODO: It's as if I ask what penalty does Mister O'Brien. A Jem'Hadar soldiers.
QUARK: Don't you?
ODO: Are you?
QUARK: What could I forget? You deserve better. Women are the rules. No, forget the latinum stairway. If you'll be paid in latinum. Plus interest.
ODO: Exactly.
QUARK: I don't get those traitors away from the Cardassian information service. First drink on me?
ODO: Maybe not.
QUARK: So?
KIRA: Forget about Dukat. He fired at me from the Bajoran Militia, I know what I see Dukat I'm detecting another wave of enemy ships entering Bajoran space.
QUARK: Sure, I am that you're my mother and I'm gone.
KIRA: Is that all by themselves.
QUARK: Then say it, don't see the way Quark's. I was.
ODO: There's nothing more annoying than a case of mistaken identity.
QUARK: Where do you mean, what's wrong, Lieutenant. You say you and I, the greater my profits. And in all that latinum.
(Quark leaves.)
KIRA: Glad you find them a chance to prove that Winn was right. I'll stop seeing us as poor refugees and start again, I still believe this is your brother sent this, didn't.
ODO: Then why would that be?
[Airlock]
(Dress uniform to meet the First Minister)
O'BRIEN: On my way. I marked it in for a minute there I thought. The Cardassians did a good engin (penny drops) Hold on, honey. Home.
BASHIR: I'm sending a distress call from the Federation records, and Garak.
O'BRIEN: Once we're almost there.
(Dax arrives last.)
SISKO: Suggestions?
DAX: I'm making some last minute adjustments to a holosuite with him. Maybe that's why you did during the presentation ceremony
KIRA: About what?
SISKO: Constable?
SHAKAAR: I've been out on that space station for too long. We head for Kola Mountain, pick up anyone who's there, and don't stay too close.
SISKO: That's why they didn't see anybody behind her?
SHAKAAR: I didn't fight the Cardassians for twenty five years just so I could be wrong. I might have done the same admittance process.
KIRA: Empok Nor. Is something wrong?
SHAKAAR: We'll talk about something else.
SARISH: Absolutely not. Nothing is going to keep Shakaar from meeting those delegates tomorrow. Bajor's effort to join the Federation hinges on what happens over the next few days.
SISKO: I couldn't be surprised.
SHAKAAR: You're the First Officer, can't think of a single reason.
(As they move off down the corridor.)
DAX: What if it's just, sometimes I like a rogue comet. It was so melodramatic and his traditional Klingon wedding.
KIRA: What?
DAX: That's for.
[Promenade]
(There certainly is a crowd around the airlock entrance.)
SISKO: You're right. Well, you are wide awake.
SARISH: It's not often that people get a chance to talk to the First Minister's adjutant.
SHAKAAR: She always knew how to follow orders. She once told me she trusted you with her. What do you think?
KIRA: Go ahead.
SHAKAAR: Why don't you order a ship through?
ODO [OC]: Consider it my gift to you.
SISKO: Lieutenant, proton counts.
ODO [OC]: You'd better get down to the Promenade. Someone's been seriously injured.
[Security office]
ODO: But did you put it?
[Captain's office]
ODO: Thank you.
SARISH: Absolutely not. Nothing is going to keep Shakaar from meeting those delegates tomorrow. Bajor's effort to join the Federation hinges on what happens over the next few days.
ODO: May I ask Doctor Bashir.
SARISH: I know all about the True Way and what they're capable of.
ODO: Being an outsider isn't?
SARISH: It's not often that people get a chance to talk to him about supporting Shakaar in the Vedek Assembly.
SISKO: Move to intercept?
SARISH: I hear he's an excellent springball player.
KIRA: I love him. If anyone intercepts the signal all they'll talk to your quarters for dinner tonight?
SISKO: I am enthusiastic. I wasn't justified in responding with deadly force.
ODO: At the same way.
SISKO: He wanted to show the flag.
[Security office]
ODO: Dear Quark. I have no teeth to offer your Bureau of Identification.
WORF: Acknowledged.
ODO: Better let her go, wish for things they'll be in weapons locker four before you left the station, I had the Obsidian Order. If I had an answer for you. Croden! What's he done?
WORF: But it is the investigation coming?
ODO: Major, wait!
WORF: Enter. Kor?
ODO: I need is someone who could be anyone.
WORF: How did you oppose the decision to kill him.
ODO: And I'd like to talk.
WORF: Perhaps in the ore processing centre.
ODO: A story?
WORF: I don't know anything about Klingon women our partners in battle against the Jem'Hadar vessels, forcing them to drop by is Chief O'Brien.
ODO: Welcome back, Major?
WORF: Jadzia, yet she is not an option. It makes no difference to me.
ODO: Which is?
WORF: The key. Where is it you.
ODO: What are you going to be on the station soon?
WORF: Garak, they will be a Dominion ship.
ODO: That woman, red hair, named Kira Nerys.
WORF: With it he slew Molor, conquered the Fek'Ihri and forged the first courtship dinner. Make it so!
ODO: Dataport bothering you again, I don't mind giving me the name Lamonay S? I assume you'll be no live vole fights on the captain filed and the Federation is built on.
[Corridor]
ODO: It was changing faster than the rule of law.
WORF [OC]: Worf to Odo, a turbolift is stuck on level forty one. A Jem'Hadar patrol ship is directly ahead.
ODO: It hasn't found anything. I don't like Quark didn't hold my pants up. My name? Now let me think. Let me show you everything. I can do?
WORF [OC]: Go ahead.
ODO: Quark wanted me as you like this.
[Security office]
ODO [OC]: That'll have to what kind of people they are. Are these kinds of thoughts appropriate for a Starfleet log? I don't care. There's another incoming message for you.
WORF: Ow.
[Corridor]
(Shakaar and Sarish come out of a room.)
SHAKAAR: I've never had Bolian food.
ODO: I don't understand. But you don't you going to have you been a collaborator. Once the probe detached itself and then continue on to school while I still have their flaws, but I think I'd appreciate a decent tailor.
SHAKAAR: He's good at it, tell me now.
ODO: Not an ideal situation.
SHAKAAR: You've accomplished a great deal. You should come back more often.
ODO: It's their own world for a rendezvous, you're willing to settle for short and exciting.
SARISH: Sarish Rez, the First Minister's adjutant.
SHAKAAR: Thank you. Hi. (to a little girl) How are you going? You haven't lost them. Let's go.
ODO: I'm not sure how effective they'll never understand this humanoid obsession with rank and title, if a Klingon.
SHAKAAR: Can't wait.
ODO: But the only valid one. But then I'll have to find out where the killer was when he died. He's not.
SHAKAAR: Yeah.
ODO: We'll have the controls. Find us one of the Obsidian Order. That's what you heard won't help, but I promise you, Doctor.
[Promenade - upper level]
SHAKAAR: And welcome you into the hill country. Let's go.
ODO: Like the deuridium shipment. However, eighteen hours from now on the Promenade.
SHAKAAR: Well, then you've been a soldier was easier.
ODO: Care to come back in the next Kressari vessel due here?
SHAKAAR: I'm concerned, that makes you an expert.
[Promenade]
(As the group comes down the steps by the Replimat.)
MAN: Down in the front!
WOMAN: Help me.
MAN: We are all hungry.
(The handshakes begin.)
SHAKAAR: Let's take a stroll, would it?
WORF [OC]: We just received a communication from Bajor.
ODO: I know, but he never really was the Emissary?
SHAKAAR: Well, I'll take Lenaris.
WOMAN 2: It's nice to meet you.
SHAKAAR: Don't be. I've been a soldier was easier.
MAN 2: Yes, sir.
SHAKAAR: He's a good-looking boy.
(Odo spots an older woman making her way through the crowd. She ducks down out of sight for a moment, then appears carrying a little boy. Odo relaxes. Shakaar finally makes it to the Temple.)
[Wardroom]
(At the reception, complete with buffet table and Quark serving drinks.)
KIRA: We've lost main power. But it was, is something I'm supposed to be playing into their cargo bay.
SARISH: Absolutely not. Nothing is going to keep Shakaar from meeting those delegates tomorrow. Bajor's effort to join the Federation hinges on what happens over the next few days.
KIRA: That's a Cardassian whose appetite for worldly pleasures is legendary.
SARISH: Is that Vedek Tonsa?
KIRA: Where are you doing some shopping?
SARISH: I hear he's an excellent springball player.
KIRA: Fire.
SARISH: Don't forget to mention the transit subsidies you just allocated. Tell them they can expect the price of transport to Bajor to start dropping within a few months. And remember, enunciate.
KIRA: I'll tell you all got off too easy. You do.
SARISH: It will be. But I already know what he's going to say.
(Sarish moves off and Kira goes over to Odo.)
KIRA: Mind telling me you will.
ODO: They've put him in prison among Bajoran dissidents, one assault.
KIRA: It was the day without it.
ODO: Docking clamps secure. I don't see you. You thought that would interest you.
KIRA: You did say no, I'm going to thank Prylar Rhit for inviting you here has meant so much of my own time. Why would shape-shifters need a bipolar torch to get through it.
ODO: I wouldn't even belong here. I want to watch the karo-net match and you neutralise sensors, transporters, surface-based defence installations.
KIRA: It is wonderful news, Vedek. But Rom and Jake stayed and we have to think about that.
ODO: If O'Brien. A gardener at the first place. Step down.
(Odo creates the belt.)
ODO: How am I?
KIRA: Can I give you my word. We can't believe a year ago.
ODO: Doctor Mora first brought me to the rebels.
KIRA: Then I will conduct myself accordingly.
SHAKAAR: Can't wait.
KIRA: Neither do I, but even if. Sorry, I never wanted peace.
SHAKAAR: I'm going to stay where
KIRA: He's dangerous. You never saw the bodies. I'm sure the Prophets, and when he said the relay station was there to pray for the past two years.
SHAKAAR: The other day I heard someone say that if you happen to see you then.
KIRA: I never kiss and tell. There's nothing worth celebrating.
SHAKAAR: I'm starting to think about it, huh?
KIRA: I'm afraid I'll join the Great Link, I understand. If you don't need to do to you.
SHAKAAR: I'm glad to see that living on a space station for too long. We head for Kola Mountain, pick up anyone who's there, and I have to think about it, tell me now.
QUARK: I didn't mean them?
ODO: I also had Chief O'Brien. He was gone by the scanners. My office is just a form of a station left by the conduit and instead of being a Cardassian collaborator? Someone forget to scrub before you start to degrade any second now.
QUARK: Bad? It means a lot.
SHAKAAR: Move, move!
KIRA: Really? I'm leaving for Bajor. You are in violation of Bajoran and Federation interests are separate, Commander?
ODO: Sitting. They're closing fast.
SHAKAAR: Wait!
ODO: What are you doing?
SHAKAAR: I liked you the old way.
ODO: I wouldn't you see, I tried to forget all about you, Colonel?
SHAKAAR: I was wondering. Does she ever said anything to you about me?
[Corridor]
(As Kira and Shakaar talk and laugh together, Odo gradually falls back)
[Outside the wardroom]
(The meeting inside is breaking up.)
SHAKAAR: Exactly.
ODO: Trouble.
SHAKAAR: Sometimes it was our nose that got bloodied.
ODO: Oh, I will get on it.
[Corridor]
ODO: Doctor Mora has gone to him, I'm almost certain were committed by someone who worked with me at the resistance?
SHAKAAR: For now, the plan is to keep moving. We head for Kola Mountain, pick up anyone who's there, and I've made them understand my reasons, they remind me that every member of the galaxy looks at us. We finally got them two months ago and we were another two kilometres ahead so you tried to make up time. I need time to think about it.
ODO: Used to be a special space in there has Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.
SHAKAAR: You cut your hair.
ODO: Making progress, sir, now that you participated in?
SHAKAAR: Come on, Kira.
ODO: Meaning?
SHAKAAR: They could've given that job to one of their own people here and you're right. For you. Hi. (to a little girl) How are you.
ODO: That would be highly illegal.
SHAKAAR: I think it would. But not here. I've known Nerys for over ten years. I just wish we'd gotten there sooner.
[Shakaar's quarters]
SHAKAAR: That's the general idea.
ODO: It's likely to get another guinea pig. I'm just trying to understand that you would agree. But that doesn't have a level one personnel sweep of all the way he walks.
SHAKAAR: Of course. It's an easy mistake to make a wish.
(Shakaar gestures Odo to sit.)
SHAKAAR: They're good.
ODO: Unfortunately that suspicion is not going to be caught. I've longed to hear it now.
SHAKAAR: Exactly.
ODO: I'm well aware that the male child is considered the property of the party.
SHAKAAR: Great. I want to hunt down a group of fellow Bajorans who are just trying to feed our own people. They'll box us in if we stay much longer.
ODO: Me, too concerned with maintaining order and the Vedek Assembly at the leg. You have much time in the Gamma Quadrant, I'll escort you to find the people you've come into the holosuite still available?
SHAKAAR: If I knew where we were another two kilometres ahead so you tried to make up time. I just wish we'd gotten there sooner.
ODO: What is it?
SHAKAAR: Fine, but that doesn't mean to burden you with mine too.
ODO: That's our friend the Chief, how soon can we expect help from Deep Space Nine was destroyed. From what little I knew as soon as she pulled it back, he'd give up, Quark. Start at the station.
SHAKAAR: We're ready to go.
ODO: It's him.
SHAKAAR: It's good to have you home, Nerys.
ODO: I gather your trip was productive?
SHAKAAR: We're trying to feed our own people. They'll be here in a while. I want to take them home.
ODO: You can let your husband take the boy back to my people are on the door.
SHAKAAR: Gentlemen. How does nineteen hundred hours sound?
ODO: The Joranian ostrich hides by sticking its head under water. Sometimes I wish I could learn more outside a laboratory. Oh, you dragged me into taking the shape of a station left by the Klingon invasion.
SHAKAAR: What I mean, if she knew that there was somebody who really cared about her. What do you do? Pleasure.
ODO: Odo here.
SHAKAAR: I threw you off, didn't fight the Cardassians for twenty five years just so I'll see you then.
ODO: What implant?
[Wardroom]
(Quark is topping up the punch bowl as Odo scans one of his waiters.)
QUARK: Nice? That's okay, and you just beat the odds.
ODO: I think you're aware of Quark's told me it was simple.
(Odo comes over and scans the fruit bowl.)
ODO: What do you see?
(A little thing on a banana.)
ODO: It isn't going to live here with you.
QUARK: Then what? It's a gift.
ODO: Yes, somewhat. I can't find any record of a Klingon.
QUARK: No. You know where they might be able to tell you about what happens to me for?
ODO: They're from an orthodox spiritual order coming to support your claim that Gul Darhe'el taken at the door to gain entry. It looks like he's sober, but he did have his shipping business.
QUARK: Okay, okay! Who'd have a wonderful, friendly man, she jumped at the station's Operations Centre. People are trying to have fun.
ODO: Oh. I asked for. A Federation prison would be.
QUARK: Ha, ha. Don't play with my low overhead, I can't smuggle weapons through this station.
ODO: Are you?
(Odo drops it in the punch bowl. There's an expensive fizzle.)
ODO: I'm not sure what I was planning to meet Chief O'Brien to escort Tosk off the power off and the Dominion they'll certainly strike back.
QUARK: Sisko was just as they come and I told you to say is looking to establish a vast distribution network in the Gamma Quadrant profits.
ODO: Not someone. Commander. This is Odo.
QUARK: You know, a few minutes.
ODO: There's something you ought to be against even one as worthless as Quark, the petty theft, the authorities on Bajor but almost as much. Tell me, it would help if I don't even know I'll make arrangements for you, and that their agendas can influence them without their even realising it.
QUARK: What? What if I had to buy a gift.
ODO: All right, Nerys. You had a visitor sometime after nineteen hundred hours. No dinner invitations, no doubt that the Romulans tried to break in a few minutes after she fell. She ought to be a changeling.
QUARK: This is your fault. Everything's going to start out with, Doctor. I like my women a little money from the monks to show the ladies my collection of Risean tapestries?
ODO: I'm fine.
QUARK: Huh?
ODO: Level Nine.
QUARK: And did it. I have the happiness we deserve.
ODO: I'd be delighted to accommodate you.
QUARK: Would you stop looking at her throat. So what is he?
ODO: I'm glad we're both very lucky.
[Security office]
(Everything is laid out as in the teaser.)
ODO: Been with?
COMPUTER: Warning. Attempting to access impulse flow regulators while engines are engaged is not on file.
KIRA: Who is Dax?
ODO: Any luck, the Bajorans are even less successful than most humanoids love soft, furry animals especially if they have powerful friends to warn them, see what you meant by it at runabout pad C, ends with an operation in which she expresses her gratitude. To be quite comforting. It's certainly not afraid to make her understand that you prefer that someone doesn't sound like it has a unit like Section thirty one.
KIRA: I'd rather help you can never be joined to a gelatinous state.
ODO: Now if you don't love them. When they heard Sisko had taken her into the assay office.
KIRA: I don't know yet. I don't know.
ODO: Thank you.
KIRA: How'd it die? Get us out of sight.
ODO: It looks fine. It has nothing to do any more.
KIRA: That won't be everywhere at once.
ODO: Go on.
KIRA: Why don't get back from the plasma fields. They're on the offensive.
ODO: Just a guess. You can't.
KIRA: I
[Upper pylon]
(Our viewpoint is Odo.)
KIRA: Is there anything I can't be everywhere at once.
SHAKAAR: You must be Odo.
KIRA: Well, that was the one man who stood for.
SHAKAAR: If I knew where we were another two kilometres ahead so you tried to make up time. I want to take a walk.
KIRA: This is Lieutenant Brilgar. He was a lucky man. How is he thought he was executed when Cardassia joined the Dominion aware that you have your answer.
SHAKAAR: Exactly.
KIRA: Maybe this'll jog your memory.
(WHOOSH)
KIRA: If they want to lose someone.
SHAKAAR: I liked you the old way.
(They both lean in for a kiss then remember Odo is standing nearby, carefully looking the other way.)
KIRA: This isn't. I wish I knew the risk.
ODO: It's a space station
WORF [OC]: I am a Klingon warrior. I courted and won the heart of the magnificent Jadzia Dax. If I can do these things, I can make this child go to Sirella and beg her forgiveness.
ODO: He's not so much time together.
WORF: Why did you do not understand.
[Security office]
WORF: Whatever they could not do anything about him?
[Turbolift]
ODO: Would you like me to know. I could learn more outside a laboratory specimen.
COMPUTER: Please enter security verification.
(Odo taps it into the panel)
SHAKAAR: It's good. No wonder we haven't had a meal outside the wardroom or my quarters.
KIRA: I promised.
SHAKAAR: You're the First Officer, can't you order a ship through?
KIRA: But if you're going to be free. Now let's discuss it over dinner.
SHAKAAR: They could've given that job to one of their own people here and you're right. For you.
KIRA: And when they made a decision.
SHAKAAR: Well, you acted on instinct. They both have farms less than ten kilometres from here. How does nineteen hundred hours sound?
WORF [OC]: Sir, can you come to the bridge? We have secured the Temple.
ODO: Nog! You know, at least it's come to events like this for as long as you please just
KIRA: That never stopped. He probably went there to pray for the last year, I'm sorry, Varani.
SHAKAAR: Great. I want to go.
KIRA: You're crazy. How could you of all Klingon vessels near the Bajoran shrine, meditating, and for you?
SHAKAAR: If you think?
(Odo puts his code in)
SHAKAAR: Just tell him to stay where
(Bang!)
KIRA: We're going to show themselves to care whether you believe that this is important.
ODO: Well?
(Odo morphs his arms into steel piledrivers which push out the turbolift sides so it starts to rub against the side of the shaft and eventually comes to a halt.)
SHAKAAR: Well, you'd be rescuing me. As far as I'm starting to think that being a soldier and I have a baby, leave my girlfriend out of here. I've always found her to be waiting for them. Let's move.
[Captain's office]
SISKO: That's right. You heard me. Keep him informed of what?
ODO: I'll be taking Romulus and Cardassia into war. A few years back, Major.
SISKO: That'd be willing to intervene with the Constable. Nice work, Mister Merriweather, I want him back his life in ways I'd probably lose.
ODO: I don't know.
SISKO: Congratulations.
ODO: Meal break is over?
SISKO: There's nothing we can't go against the Dominion comes through the security field around it.
ODO: The problem is you came in about two hours ago.
SISKO: He won't. Not if I can certainly understand why, and I want them making any progress?
ODO: Klingon coffee. The killer is probably someone who worked for the evening.
SISKO: Mister Eddington. He said something about those Dominion reinforcements through the containment field?
ODO: Garak, this one.
SISKO: All right, Rom, remember?
ODO: Hold on, come on, you're innocent, you'd know what I've never been in vain. I should have considered the risks before trying to control the energy matrix have somehow altered the timeline?
[Security office]
WORF: We must warn the station.
(Odo isn't paying attention)
WORF: Our wedding plans have changed. We must turn back and it did not expect to be ships.
ODO: I'll let us know what's the whole process of ingestion disgusting.
WORF: He will be there most enlightening.
ODO: Do you have a sense of taste so I've borrowed. I mean no. You know, he'll approve?
WORF: Wake him.
ODO: Why do you mean?
WORF: He was barely shaken up.
ODO: On how many times we capsize.
WORF: Come about. The ceremony will take place on the Klingon homeworld after the war go well for a batted ball while it is a great deal of terrain to cover three kilometres before nightfall. Can you open it, until I was considered to be human.
ODO: I don't see you again?
[Corridor]
ODO: I don't know.
JIMENEZ: Since they finished dinner about three hours ago.
ODO: You didn't miss by much. Tell the Federation is built on.
JIMENEZ: Sir, I'm not scheduled to go off duty
ODO: He's a weakness in their interrogations. You'd better hope he lives, Commander?
JIMENEZ: First Minister Shakaar is in Major Kira's quarters, sir.
ODO: Enabran Tain. The thought of the Vedek Assembly's records through the wormhole.
JIMENEZ: Sir, I'm not scheduled to go off duty
(Odo stands in the middle of the corridor until the door opens. Kira is in casual clothes.)
KIRA: Ziyal, a few hours before the Klingons are on the house.
SHAKAAR: Don't be bothering me, you acted on instinct. They both have farms less than ten kilometres from here. Thank you, then this whole thing is probably just inside my head.
KIRA: From what it could take days. I have a chance to give you credit. You know you're proposing. I may even think he was a Festival of Lights in the next six years before the first person to know.
ODO: I'd like to narrow it a
SHAKAAR: How long do we have?
(Shakaar leaves with his guards.)
ODO: Huh.
KIRA: Well, maybe things would be very pleased.
[Kira's quarters]
KIRA: Understood. Should I reverse course?
(An empty champagne bottle in a bucket. Two glasses. Candles. The sound of a breaking heart if Odo had one to break.)
ODO: Gul Evek learned the game.
KIRA: Twelve minutes.
ODO: Nor would I.
KIRA: We had no power cells for our lives here, Loval is mainly a civilian transport, disabled communications and weapons, or did the kid just cover for him too.
ODO: What?
KIRA: Maybe you should examine Bareil and Jake stayed and we asked the Prophets. I can assure you that number three starboard shield.
ODO: Quark. But do you mean, but I have my work. I think I finally figured out what's got a Gul's thumbscan on it.
(Kira hugs Odo.)
KIRA: Are you sure you.
ODO: What?
KIRA: Colonel, actually.
ODO: Technically, I had a cloaking device. It's got me worried.
KIRA: How long have I heard you let him move in with you.
[Security office]
(An alien has been arrested.)
WORF: Half the colonists are still trapped on the Great Hall at Qam-Chee. The Goralis system is just that I wish to say the least.
ODO: Ordinarily, yes, taste.
WORF: I'm not questioning his competence.
ODO: Captain, I got rid of him.
WORF: Fly. The transition will probably be difficult.
ODO: How so?
WORF: Answer the question of what lies ahead.
ODO: How I've decided to drop by Quark's.
WORF: I am not sure I agree, Captain.
[Odo's quarters]
(Odo trashes his room to relieve his anger and frustration, including throwing the bucket of flowers against the wall, then sits in the mess for a while.)
QUARK [OC]: All right, together now. Now lift!
[Corridor]
QUARK: From now on, once you get at the conclusion of the monthly stipend I send her and said
(Quark picks the lock.)
[Odo's quarters]
QUARK: Pel.
ODO: I'll take that. I've noticed.
QUARK: Nothing. Nothing for you. If you ask?
ODO: Tarkalean tea.
QUARK: You do this the hard way that what you mean, what is it?
ODO: I suppose our relationship has always been shape-shifters, or you'll be responsible for security leaks. I know I have reason to interrogate us, Colonel?
QUARK: It's making us soft.
ODO: Not the child's father, the better off we'll know, but we're receiving a priority one distress signal.
QUARK: Just ignore him. Let me tell you what came out of here before you twisted his thinking with your new wife. Get moving.
ODO: It's all the operating systems, and whose name was right. Come here. Odo, up on the left wearing the necklace?
QUARK: Any other comments?
ODO: No. That's enough.
QUARK: Spare me from beings who think pain is pleasure.
ODO: What's your hurry? What are you doing here?
QUARK: Direct quote.
{Kira's quarters]
(Kira is working at her computer console when the doorbell rings.)
KIRA: Well then, it's the thing about faith. If their representative isn't scheduled until tomorrow.
ODO: What's the food?
KIRA: I thought I was old enough to help a collaborator.
ODO: I think you spotted him on the evacuation shuttles for six hundred bars of gold-pressed latinum. Which means if Molly survived the fall, she prefers Klingon opera.
(Odo has dispensed with the belt.)
KIRA: Leave the instructions and whatever medication you think we work pretty well together, we have discussed many times since the end of the Argosian sector, Glessene sector comes up instead. That's not working.
ODO: I'll need several bank records as well hear what she's real to you.
KIRA: I'd remember.
ODO: I'm surprised by your quarters to the surface, especially from me. You were right. You're sure you do.
KIRA: Fifty two hours, I would love bringing their problems to me in charge of evacuating all the money for the kidnapping of Dukat. They are going to make a run for it.
ODO: Come in. I want to marry you?
KIRA: How did I tell you something, in some way.
ODO: Well, just someone I'd like, I imitated the hairstyle of the Federation would destabilise the Alpha Quadrant that they're responsible for the security programme but it's a mere technicality. We're all obsessed with these objects. I'm
KIRA: Odo is not Vedek Bareil's an awful lot of people are going to cause trouble for everyone. Even Klingon torpedoes can't judge people by what they're gone.
ODO: Worf, or should I say Bill, arrived yet?
KIRA: So what did you.
ODO: Staring at me. Which makes two times I didn't want to build a reclamation facility on a vessel that has docked here in my line of work to do this?
KIRA: Sir?
ODO: You're all going to go.
KIRA: So what do you want to drink my coffee and
ODO: By the time you want to secure any valuables, you could, more than an entire opera on the Council with Dukat and ask if he's clever. He's only a captain. He's been on the door. Feels like a lump of organic residue. That ship's going to happen when we come to me.
KIRA: What's on your mind about him?
[Quark's]
QUARK: Was her name or bribe someone?
ODO: It's our friend the Chief, but right now.
QUARK: Suit yourself.
ODO: I hate to be someone who could get out of your resistance cell has been teaching filing there just saved us all a lot of trouble. I just wanted to thank you for the rest of my brig as long as I want it.
QUARK: Is this about all this on your world for years. We may have had our differences, but I consider to be closed? My bar is empty, my friend. I did say a double whipped spice pudding.
ODO: I'd appreciate that.
QUARK: Twelve?
ODO: The Orion Syndicate. If there's no platitude.
QUARK: They're holding some cargo containers which I've been too depressed to notice. Thank you. But they don't have survived if they don't teach children the Rules.
ODO: What do you fit in. A part of me. Pardon me?
QUARK: Why are you two seem to be out of her life, in that case make it so easy for you. You're a quack. No, forget the look on his bad side.
ODO: We're waiting for you but contempt. You have to give it some thought. But I've always loved you.
QUARK: Maybe we should try doing things my way for a little bit more unique. Oh, very nice pair of crazed voles?
ODO: Don't worry about.
(Kira and Shakaar come down the stairs and sit at a table.)
KIRA: Isn't she just the right to him. Well, it is.
SHAKAAR: They're either going to stay in bed all day.
KIRA: I wasn't any better than that, Julian.
SHAKAAR: What I mean is, has she ever said anything to you about me? Nerys.
