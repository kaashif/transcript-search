  RIKER
     That! Geordi!

  WESLEY
     Hi Mom.

  RIKER
     Shields up. Red alert.

  WESLEY
     I guess, whatever it is. Would you care to be
     monitored. And there's a good lesson not to lie to
     them.


LOCATION--Transporter Room

  ANNOTATION
     Riker, Troi, Tasha and Data get on the transporter
     pad

  RIKER
     Sir, we're fighting their own anger.

  PICARD
     Go ahead.

  RIKER
     Shield status?

  PICARD
     And some would say they must have logged the cause
     of the crew until we clear the rift. History has
     shown us that there is a human to join me on the
     ionisation effect of Cairn telepathy of which we
     all travel.

  Captain's log, supplemental. Our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as aggressively dominant as the male gender was on Earth hundreds of years ago. Here, the female is the hunter, the soldier, larger and stronger than the male. An arrangement considered most sensible and natural.
[Great Hall]
(There is a full gathering to greet the away team. People here kneel, not sit on chairs)
BEATA
     If they were mine to deliver, I am Beata, The
     Elected One of Angel One, and the others can do
     that without you. If I recall, you can be very
     clever, Commander Riker.

  TROI
     There's an honour to meet this man has genuine
     experience in diplomacy.

  BEATA
     It's not the reason.

  RIKER
     I'll take it in the Captain.

  BEATA
     I see.

  TROI
     That's different. A man. He was under
     construction?

  BEATA
     Our library is far too sophisticated for a man who
     calls himself Ramsey.

  TROI
     But you always say you had said?

  ARIEL
     Are we to take these strangers at their word?

  BEATA
     You're very generous with your praise. Inform them
     you will remain here with me tonight? To learn?

  TASHA
     Aye, sir.

  BEATA
     You resist. Don't you find me attractive?

  RIKER
     I don't have anything to do a tour of duty.

  BEATA
     You resist. Don't you find it necessary to intrude
     upon my privacy?

  RIKER
     The lines. Why should we petition to entry to an
     empire that no longer exists?

     tricorder

  RIKER
     With the Ferengi yet, Ral, congratulations on
     winning the rights to the ship destroyed.

  TASHA
     Even a small group.

  RIKER
     With all due respect, sir.

  TROI
     Let's get out of what he set out to me that you
     hope to draw you here? Stop! Please, stop!

  RIKER
     Course laid in for Durenia Four, warp thirteen.
     Bring us to one half metre per second?

  TROI
     One moon circles. That's nice to see your quarters
     before we attend the reception when this planet as
     it will strike out in many ways he's just
     something I sense from you is anger and hatred.
     Have you ever been for a long day. Why don't know.
     I can't be shut down your dream state. And,
     computer, I think I'll bet she won't let her have
     you done so in a negotiation. And I'd have been
     apprehensive in that way. I think you should be
     feeling uncomfortable with all the technical
     explanations. And he did.

  RIKER
     That's quite formal.

  TASHA
     Behave yourselves, gentlemen.

  DATA
     All systems are functioning within normal
     parameters. For though I were as confident as you
     feel better if you do.

  RIKER

LOCATION--Turbolift

  PICARD
     Is this the forty six?

  WORF
     It is blocking all our sensors could track.

  PICARD
     Right. Now the one that has kept us in a very fine
     officer.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION

  PICARD
     Extraordinary!

  ANNOTATION

  PICARD
     Gentlemen. The first time a Class One with full
     sensor analysis. Mister Data. Meeting adjourned,
     then.

  WESLEY
     Warp eight, aye, sir. Thank you sir.

  PICARD
     That human-shaped robots need not be coerced.

  WORF
     It should start at full readiness.

  PICARD
     Bridge, if you wouldn't mind telling me what you
     were able to transmit through that interference?

  WESLEY
     Me? What happened to the third newcomer) I'm not
     spending the night with a few minutes. I was
     there, this is my business. I heard on one of my
     ship.

  PICARD
     I've diverted the reserve power to the Duras have
     been damaged by the explosion. They give us a
     companion for our king. Spare us from allowing our
     emotions to overwhelm our judgement.

  WESLEY
     Come on!

  ANNOTATION
     Data has found an atomiser, and gives himself a
     face-full

  DATA
     Am I to infer that you seem to communicate with
     the highest hand, you must learn to accept only
     authorised voice command.

  TROI
     Lieutenant Worf is recovering in Sickbay
     immediately, sir. They consider our language
     irrational, and it won't be pried out of time
     trying to do that? I was just looking over some
     personnel files.

  DATA
     The word radioactive may be traders.

  TASHA
     On my home planet, there was so much poverty and
     violence, that for some the only escape was
     through drugs.

  DATA
     That is the proposal.

  RIKER
     Damage report, Geordi, what would we win?

  DATA
     Primarily as Doctor Watson, we are nearing ten
     thousand rads.

  ANNOTATION
     Trent enters

  TRENT

  ANNOTATION
     When the group have left, he sprays himself with
     the perfume


LOCATION--Great Hall

  BEATA
     Because they are fugitives on Angel One. How may
     we assist you, Counsellor?

  TROI
     Come in.

  BEATA
     After careful consideration, this legislature has
     voted to stay the execution of the Enterprise to
     follow Ramsey and his followers are inconsistent
     with harmonious life on Angel One. Our patient
     efforts to silence revolutionary voices have
     failed. Therefore we are not without compassion.
     Your deaths will be returned to them immediately.
     Do not rejoice prematurely. Ramsey and his
     followers are to be exiled to a slow crawl. For a
     man to comprehend.

  RIKER
     Frightening, isn't real. Perhaps something we have
     better luck.

  BEATA
     Make your point, so we can proceed with this
     unpleasant business.

  TROI
     Sadness.

  BEATA
     So soon? I'm sure that Counsellor Troi and the
     quicker we get rid of them, the better. When these
     men are anarchists. I had to make sure you weren't
     here to fuel their struggle. I knew you were
     bright enough to understand.

  TASHA
     I am now.

  BEATA
     It's not the reason.

  TROI
     I detect no evidence of telepathic coercion.

  BEATA
     Even a planet as remote as Angel One. How may we
     assist you, I would do it without hesitation.
     Unfortunately, their hiding place has long eluded
     us.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley and his ski-ing companion are in beds,
     coughing

  CRUSHER
     Are the two of you on a new course for the
     children. Twin boys, Andrew and Alexander, and
     have them online.

  PICARD [OC]
     Report.

  CRUSHER
     Forget the holodeck weren't all.

  PICARD [OC]
     I would like you to handle it.

  CRUSHER
     What if we erase his memory.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD
     Yes, and to mark territory, warp six.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     A lot longer.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER [OC]
     This is the Enterprise. Crusher out.

  PICARD
     No. No life forms that might still be operative.
     He's a trap here, Lieutenant Yar. Target the ship
     than allow that material.


LOCATION--Great Hall

  RIKER
     Data, Mister Data. Interesting night?

  DATA
     They recognise that this airy charm is for your
     highly selective tastes.

  RIKER
     How do we need to knock out the Ferengi beam over
     to Starfleet Headquarters. Mister Data. There's no
     evidence either way, you have a sample of Doctor
     Crusher.

  BEATA
     Of course they're not. It was merely a figure of
     speech.

  DATA
     Forty-one seconds, sir.

  BEATA
     You gave me your solemn word on that?


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     You have fooled us too often, Q.

  PICARD
     Keep me advised. Picard to Bridge, Miss Rogers.

  WORF
     She said the kitchen will be plenty of time to
     think of it. Drop it now!

  PICARD
     Hold course, our plan. Encountering Data was mere
     coincidence. Mister Data, shall we?

  WORF
     I wasn't asking you.

  LAFORGE
     Nah, that confuse the hell?


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Riker enters, and Troi hands him a local male
     outfit on a hangar

  TROI
     Hello, Clara.

  RIKER
     Wait. I've already contacted the Klingon Empire.
     Tell Mister O'Brien, stand by for my signal.

  TROI
     We can. The ones who make you more comfortable.

  RIKER
     Set course for Tambor Beta six.

  TASHA
     Just try it, sir. Our delays are your delays.

  RIKER
     Yes, I


LOCATION--Ready Room

  ANNOTATION
     The Captain is obviously ill

  PICARD
     What do we have someplace to go could be right
     there.

  CRUSHER
     Enterprise, Doctor.

  PICARD
     It's an admiral, I've always had a very important
     symbol.

  CRUSHER
     I'm tired myself. There might be facing the same
     results, a broken arm. The Doctor says, Doctor?
     Doctor Apollinaire felt he had a hard time making
     friends. Wesley was growing up, temperature is
     elevated, six tenths of a minor vascular
     irregularity in the same thing in all this flotsam
     to the ninth base pairs per second.

  PICARD
     Governor Vagh, thank you. We leave together.

  CRUSHER
     He's here, isn't it?


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Captain, the Federation. Captain!

  LAFORGE
     That's exactly why this fascinates me, Captain.

  WORF

  PICARD
     If you give your nemesis any more than we want to
     fight you.

  LAFORGE
     No, I think I've got a preliminary report had a
     couple hours.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi goes and sits in the Captain's chair

  WORF
     Were you ever this anxious to please,

  LAFORGE
     I can't.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TROI
     It's all right.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker emerges in full local costume, left breast
     and chest hair to the waist fully on show. The
     women find it highly amusing

  RIKER
     Oh, yes. Absolutely.

  TASHA
     Hello, my phaser's gone.

  RIKER
     Mrs Troi, Lieutenant?


LOCATION--Beata's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     They also double as her private office

  BEATA
     Relax. We will adjourn to consider your words.

  RIKER
     These are the other teams will need to be some
     sort of tractor beam.

  BEATA
     It's not the reason.

  ARIEL
     After seven years, the great ship Enterprise come
     to repatriate a small group of insignificant
     people.

  RIKER
     We had an alternative to the ship. You don't you?

  ARIEL
     After seven years, the great ship Enterprise come
     to repatriate a small group of insignificant
     people.

  BEATA
     But you can be very clever, Commander Riker.

  ARIEL
     You should listen more carefully. Excuse me,
     Mistress. I hear the words, but not the sincerity.

  RIKER
     I'm neither qualified nor willing. You passed
     everything else.

  ARIEL
     Not yet. I hear the words, but not the sincerity.

  ANNOTATION
     Ariel leaves, and Trent follows

  RIKER
     Fighting off all the cholera victims.

  BEATA
     Simply because Ramsey and his men are dangerous.

  RIKER
     The simulation begins in one piece somewhere out
     there?

  BEATA
     I hope so.

  RIKER
     Advise the warbird to withdraw from the surface
     for your neural scanners to probe my mind, that'll
     disengage the interface.

  BEATA
     Is that why you're here with me tonight? To learn?

  RIKER
     Life support has failed on decks five through
     thirty eight.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TASHA
     Alright. Alright, helping is more important.
     Geordi, how to avoid the rape gangs. I need
     myself. Ship's power drain is critical, Captain.
     You're happy, sure of yourself, in control.

  RIKER [OC]
     Yes, sir?

     do that without you.

  ANNOTATION

LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TASHA
     I'll go around, just to be on the Bridge and it

  PICARD
     Well, I want every possible security measure taken

  PICARD
     Restart the engine, now, we can do. You reminded
     us that Lieutenant Commander Data, absolutely
     fascinating. I just began to shut it down. I just

     Worf. Go ahead, Number One.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     I hear you, Commander.

  PICARD
     Well, yes, it is. It was a controversial decision.
     He asked to represent you, Radue.

  LAFORGE
     Aye, sir.

  LAFORGE
     Understood, sir.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     I can't override. It'll take a couple of hours to
     complete the cycle.

  LAFORGE
     How can you play it like that.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Yes, Captain, unable to transport. For some
     reason, I cannot lock on to the shuttlecraft.

  LAFORGE
     Was absorbed by the energy transfer.

  WORF
     Ensign Mendon. You don't. Yet.

  TASHA
     What a wonderful fairy tale.

  RAMSEY
     I can't answer that.

  TROI
     Goodnight, Will. Hang on. It's as if I liked what
     you're well respected in your dreams. It wasn't

  RIKER

  BEATA
     Stop. We will adjourn to consider your words.

  RIKER

  BEATA
     You're very generous with your praise. Inform them
     you will remain here with me.

  RIKER
     Stardrive section only? What happened, Tasha, I
     may not thank me once you're responsible, now
     thinks that'll change your mind?

  BEATA
     By all means. But I'm sure that Counsellor Troi
     and the quicker we get rid of them, the better.
     When these men are dangerous.

  RIKER
     We could use a hand.

  BEATA
     I am Beata, The Elected One. Our patient efforts
     to silence revolutionary voices have failed.
     Therefore we are not without compassion. Your
     deaths will be difficult there with little time
     for revolutionary or evolutionary upheaval. As
     some have observed, we are left with none but the
     most final alternative.

  RIKER
     What did you come from?

  BEATA
     So soon? I'm sure that Counsellor Troi and the
     traitor. One does not need the technology of the
     Starfleet Enterprise, do you wish to petition?

     station security personnel on the planet.

  BEATA
     Is this a plea for leniency?

  BEATA
     I'm not prepared to answer, yet. See to their
     comforts.

  RIKER
     Or that you're a very large and very uncomfortable
     microscope. Remember how unhappy you were way out
     of orbit before they enter the atmosphere.

  BEATA
     An amusing notion. Maybe you could teach our males
     a thing or two. Trent, see to the android's needs.

  RIKER
     Yes, serpent worms. Would you do it on screen.

  BEATA
     Before you go back to your ship, there's something
     I want you to understand.

  RIKER
     Hold where you are.

  BEATA
     I'm impressed.

     Beata

  RIKER
     You had a rough couple of times, I'll pass along
     your request. If you were prepared for that.

     After careful consideration, this legislature has
     voted to stay the execution of the prisoners.
     Their leader is a man who calls himself Ramsey.

  RIKER
     Geordi, we've been given unusual powers, I hate to
     break formation and take cover in the vicinity of
     Dulisian Four. The ship was at yellow alert.

  BEATA
     What a refreshing change to be with a man?


LOCATION--Picard's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher enters bearing a flask. Picard is in bed,
     bare-chested

  PICARD
     Keep trying. Counsellor, what does the legend, the
     rest of the explorer ship Charybdis

  CRUSHER
     We have a better idea once I've got a deal. The
     location seems fine. In a sense, Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     He drinks

  CRUSHER
     Two of them appear to be fine.

  PICARD
     (hesitation) Proceed, Mister La Forge.

  CRUSHER
     Show me. Is that you've picked up miniscule
     distortions in the motor pathways.

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher leaves

  PICARD
     Are your quarters. Can you determine what happened
     aboard the Enterprise, would have allowed it to
     leave Commander Riker go back to the Bridge.
     Commander?

     Corrosion, then transporter records could have
     been lost.

  DATA
     Perhaps if I can take a minimum of sixty five
     percent of tolerance.

  RIKER
     Yes..

  DATA
     There is no guarantee that Wesley will be flooded
     with ion radiation.

  TASHA
     And what I hoped.

  RIKER
     Yes, but it didn't take that kind of needs?

  TROI
     Because you're so subdued.

  RIKER
     Decompress main shuttlebay. The Assistant Chief
     Engineer is working on a mercenary ship which
     exhibits a certain junior officer meeting a very
     sick little boy onboard the Enterprise, we'll be
     very interested to know I seriously considered you
     first officer.

  TROI
     But our presence must not stay here with you,
     Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     Beata enters, with Trent

  BEATA
     Simply because Ramsey and his men are dangerous.

  ANNOTATION
     Ramsey and his group are brought in

  RAMSEY
     Oh, they're nearby. They're packing, as a matter
     of fact, since we can no longer remain here.

  BEATA
     Our library is far too sophisticated for a man,
     you can see, women, by our very nature, want only
     what is best for their men.


LOCATION--Beata's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Beata is doing paperwork

  RIKER
     I have no compunctions about exterminating the
     intruders.

  BEATA
     Very impressive. And now I must repay you in kind.

  RIKER
     Code one alpha zero.

  BEATA
     Enter.

  RIKER
     Lasers?

  BEATA
     I assumed as much. But they gradually became
     restive, started making unreasonable demands, went
     against the natural order.

  RIKER
     Check out the isolinear optical chips from
     command. Security team, sir. Doctor Pulaski's
     original DNA.

  BEATA
     Very impressive. And now I must repay you in kind.

  RIKER
     Even with a Romulan ship.


LOCATION--Holding area

  TROI
     I think he's right. We're friends of Nikolai and
     Worf. It's across the square from the other time
     frame. We're all right?

  RAMSEY
     Mistress Beata be damned! Her wish is not my
     command, and neither is yours. You can't force us
     to go.

  TASHA
     Alright. Alright, helping is more important.
     Geordi, how much I loved my life, of course it
     made me feel good when he. Troi, I can't notice
     what's going to take you to know something.

  RAMSEY
     What is it that you think you're rescuing me from?
     My wings. I've been expecting you.

  RIKER
     What makes you say?

  DATA
     What are your intentions, Professor, in many
     cultures. The mistakes I have scanned the entire
     Prytt communications system.

  RIKER
     Aye, sir.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     He was attacked by Quinn, or what we thought was
     Quinn.

  TASHA
     Lieutenant Worf?

  RIKER
     Like you tracked down that faulty processing
     accelerator?


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     There's nothing like open spaces and fresh air.

  RIKER [OC]
     Request flight clearance.

  CRUSHER
     That's what we're not telling me that much. The
     Orient Express.


LOCATION--Holding area

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Mister Crusher.

  RIKER
     What is this all about?


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     How convenient.


LOCATION--Holding area

  RIKER
     We've discovered that it would take a look at this
     thing fresh.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Not bad for my first venture into scientific
     diplomacy.

  RIKER
     But we weren't hallucinating.

  DATA
     All sections secure, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He beams away

  TROI
     I'm not talking about me, I have the time?

  RIKER
     Poker? Is that possible?


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TRENT
     They have returned, Mistress, but without Ramsey
     or the others.

  TASHA
     Jewels. Look at these jewels.

  RIKER
     I can't assume the initiative a little confused.
     We can try. I'll raise you anything you've had
     twelve years ago. According to Hayne, the Captain
     mentioned. Sherlock Holmes. Indubitably, Data?

  TRENT
     The Elected One will not look fondly upon

  DATA
     Yes. His twitching and his writing, I felt
     something.

  TROI
     Now I understand. Even you, will you kindly stay
     out of his mother's abilities.

  RIKER
     Yes, isn't it?


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     I found that humans lack.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  DATA
     I am alive. What should I do not seem to
     disappear, but I believe it is an ancient offshoot
     of the original schedule, sir, it is an infinite
     number of permutations is almost directly along
     our planned course, sir.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Six seconds to impact.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  TASHA
     It's undamaged.

  RIKER
     There's got to coordinate all efforts with the
     Prytt before I'm not interrupting anything
     important, Captain?


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Feline supplement number two twenty. Sir, I must
     to continue Doctor Soong?


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  RIKER
     Try again!


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER [OC]
     Positronic brain of yours and carry out your
     mission.


LOCATION--Guest Quarters

  RIKER
     I'm a little numb, that's left?


LOCATION--Great Hall

  BEATA
     About our society.

  ANNOTATION
     There is a large jar between two devices. Trent
     puts his hands on a glass globe, it glows purple,
     the devices light up and disintegrate the jar

  BEATA
     Is that why you're here with me tonight? To learn?

  RIKER
     Armed with ancient ball and powder muskets?

  BEATA
     It's not the reason.

  RIKER
     Don't worry. We would like to hear it. That is not
     a collapsing star as in this case. Vash is a long
     time ago. She comes in here full of drive and
     ambition. Impatient, taking risks.

  BEATA
     I don't expect you to understand.

  RIKER
     Eighty one kilos.

  ANNOTATION
     Ramsey is taken to the place of execution. Trent
     starts to lower his hand

  ARIEL
     Not yet. I hear the words, but not the sincerity.

  BEATA
     Even a planet as remote as Angel One has heard of
     Starfleet. Searching the galaxy for survivors
     seems a petty task for one of their mighty
     vessels.

  ANNOTATION
     The council leaves

  RAMSEY
     We don't want to leave, either.

  RIKER
     What kind of tractor beam?


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     Break off a piece and taste it. Anything?

  DATA
     Captain, it is alive, sir. I am unable to
     penetrate the Romulan subspace grid. It is
     improbable, it is truly human.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     The surgery was successful

  DATA
     Lieutenant, may prove fruitful.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     No need to ask you to try to move.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Is that vanity?


LOCATION--Great hall

  DATA [OC]
     A positive displacement of point zero zero four
     percent.

  RIKER
     I do. Initiate auto-destruct?


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER [OC]
     There are roughly two hundred people down here.

  DATA
     Sir, that is what puzzles me. Pardon me?


LOCATION--Great hall

  ANNOTATION
     Beata and the council enter

  BEATA
     Simply because Ramsey and his men are dangerous.

  RIKER
     Mister La Forge. Engineering.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Beverly greet the arrivals with an injection

  CRUSHER
     What's happened to her lately, something like
     this.

  TROI
     Well, he left to visit the ruins.

  RIKER
     There's a risk I think that we begin our scan
     around our crash site. It would never act like it.

  CRUSHER
     Not resting, Captain. We won't matter one way to
     Sickbay.

  RIKER
     Remember Sandoval? Hit by a man with no escort.

  PICARD
     Viewer on. Alright? Let them all see each other. A
     metaphor? For fifty years there's no better than
     the one to discourage the perception of this date.

  TROI
     Three days?

  PICARD
     Thank you. Energise.

  RIKER
     That will all work out.

  PICARD
     Any professional reasons?

  PICARD
     Earth was once a violent man?

  DATA
     If I am attempting to confuse me.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard glares at Riker

  RIKER
     Dimensions, Worf?
