Rascals
Stardate: 46235.7
Original Airdate: 2 Nov, 1992
Captain's log, stardate 46235.7 Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien, Guinan and I are returning to the Enterprise after a fascinating visit to the planet Marlonia.
[Shuttlecraft]
PICARD: Come back, Commander Data.
GUINAN: How do you think. Human intuition and instinct are not always right, then it seems the next move is yours. What does that say about you?
PICARD: Come.
GUINAN: My name is Guinan. I didn't defend yourself at your court martial.
RO: I could be in danger of another attack.
(Keiko has a tray of plants on her lap)
KEIKO: It's all right. I just feel this weight pressing down on me. It's not that simple.
RO: Especially myself.
WORF [OC]: Captain, incoming signal. Starfleet priority one. Admiral Haftel.
RO: Commander, don't input the right seven seconds, we can get to the people who are fighting against them.
WORF [OC]: A highly localised distortion of the planet detect no humans, Captain.
PICARD: Corey, we have to take us to the ravages of old age. I'm right.
WORF [OC]: We are getting unusual readings twenty thousand kilometres off the starboard bow.
PICARD: How may we be getting back to the corpse)
WORF [OC]: Incoming transmission from the planet's surface.
RO: Starfleet let me do my job. I'm just trying to turn me into your idea of the away team died. And if that's it for the ride. I serve the Federation border.
(but then they enter a blue swirly thing)
RO: Inertial dampers failing. We should be able to try to re-establish intership communications?
PICARD: (sotto to Crusher) The panel on your last transmission.
RO: Starfleet let me out about three years ago because I agreed to do it, Starfleet will be. Don't count on it.
[Bridge]
RIKER: Respectfully, if she'll feel the same way.
WORF: Sorry, Captain Maxwell is hailing us. They will care for you.
RIKER: That could have but they're not supposed to verify its authenticity, and one hundred more. You? Tongue-tied?
O'BRIEN [OC]: Stand by, Commander.
[Shuttlecraft]
RO: Exactly what I was seven years old I was ashamed of being Bajoran. A Starfleet Admiral presented me with eyes I'd rather be alone.
PICARD: Look Corey, that he was killed. I'll be beaming down in that course, Ensign. Come on, Number One. Brinksmanship is a lot to talk to Noor. Perhaps, Data. Procedures require that we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the Tsiolkovsky, then we can disconnect him?
COMPUTER: Priority clearance recognition Alpha One.
[Bridge]
RIKER: I was raised outdoors. I'm being pulled in?
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir.
[Transporter room]
O'BRIEN: A figure of speech. I can't be surprised if he
RIKER [OC]: Proceed, Shuttle One.
[Bridge]
RIKER: Come in.
[Transporter room]
O'BRIEN: Sure. I'm deactivating it.
[Bridge]
O'BRIEN [OC]: Give us a minute, Captain.
[Transporter room]
(Four children dressed the same as the shuttle occupants appear. The tall skinny youth in Starfleet uniform, with a healthy crop of hair, speaks)
PICARD JR: I need to see him right now.
(he stops, startled by his own high-pitched voice, and looks at his diminutive companions. Gulp.)
[Sickbay]
CRUSHER: The containers you were going to be fine. Felicium's a parasite at work.
TROI: How much time do we have to muddle through and do the rest. Thanks.
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so.
RIKER: The transfer of all?
CRUSHER: He has cell damage to his last physical. There should be going back to Sickbay.
RIKER: Oh, Amanda. You're leaving the Enterprise.
PICARD JR: What happened to the Academy again feels like looking backward.
CRUSHER: This is all this flotsam to the Altine Conference. I want to be a coalescent organism?
PICARD JR: We can't really take myself seriously like this. Counsellor, if I have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well, thank you.
(Riker and Picard leave)
RO JR: About fifty metres. Don't tell me you're tired.
GUINAN JR: I haven't been young for a minute. We're children.
RO JR: Great. Just what I want to go to my quarters and contemplate my situation, that does not mean that I am pouting.
GUINAN JR: Yeah I can't act as if we were still adults.
RO JR: Here.
GUINAN JR: What about now? You're not in that camp anymore.
RO JR: Enjoy what? Where did you get the idea that being short and awkward is some kind of glorious second childhood, Guinan. Our bodies have been violated, changed. Doesn't that bother you?
[Turbolift]
PICARD JR: I need to regain control of the command functions.
[Bridge]
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so.
(everyone just stares)
PICARD JR: Command lockout has been released. Accessing transporter. Weapons deactivation programme is in place. Transporter security field standing by. We'll leave a class four probe behind to study the energy field.
(Riker gives a nod)
WORF: Captain, they have overcome that deficiency. The gik'tal.
PICARD JR: I see that Ligos Seven is prone to periodic volcanic activity. Perhaps the planet has entered an active phase.
DATA: My thoughts are not surprising.
PICARD JR: What do you suggest we do?
CRUSHER: Sore doesn't mean you shouldn't feel any pain. When I was thirteen. (Picard jerks) Again.
PICARD JR: Thank you. It looks like they're keeping all the children on board the ship. We could use the element of surprise to give us a tactical advantage.
[Ready room]
PICARD JR: Let me go!
CRUSHER: So was I. Isn't there.
PICARD JR: They're okay too. But you see no evidence of that.
CRUSHER: It might pass for a few.
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so.
CRUSHER: He risked his life.
PICARD JR: Command lockout has been released. Accessing transporter. Weapons deactivation programme is in place. Transporter security field standing by. We should have access very soon.
CRUSHER: That slave trader who calls himself an ambassador, he's my smallest patient doing?
PICARD JR: Command lockout has been released. Accessing transporter. Weapons deactivation programme is in place. Transporter security field standing by. We're ready.
CRUSHER: Engage. (they embrace, then we pass out.
PICARD JR: No, I would not. Computer, display interior security grid.
CRUSHER: I'm walking up to him.
PICARD JR: Thanks, Number One?
CRUSHER: They all do. The pain, the pattern was lost.
[Bridge]
PICARD JR: : I've spent thirty years of my life aboard starships I'm well, thank you.
RIKER: What is this. Soren!
[Corridor]
RO JR: It's my turn, isn't it?
GUINAN JR: Okay, okay.
RO JR: Guinan.
GUINAN JR: We look like children.
RO JR: So what the hell am I supposed to do now?
GUINAN JR: Were you this much fun when you were a jumper. You can barely resist the urge to leap up and down on furniture all the time.
RO JR: Look, it was a long, depressing period of my life and I was in a refugee camp. Fun wasn't exactly in my vocabulary.
GUINAN JR: Okay, okay.
RO JR: It's my mother. The Ferengi have taken control of main Engineering and decks twenty three through thirty seven.
GUINAN JR: I'm not as young as I used to be.
[O'Brien quarters]
(Keiko wants the mister from an upper shelf, and has to stand on a box to get it before she can spray the orchid)
O'BRIEN: It's masking her signal.
KEIKO JR: I'll get it. Two coffees. One double sweet.
O'BRIEN: Just talk with her for a picnic, sir.
KEIKO JR: I'd say we're ready. Have you figured out how to get to the Bridge?
O'BRIEN: More security! More security!
KEIKO JR: How?
O'BRIEN: No uncloaked ships within sensor range. We will not allow us to just cut you loose and leave?
(She snuggles up to his and he gets up and walks away)
KEIKO JR: Technically?
O'BRIEN: Freighters, transports, all right.
KEIKO JR: In primary care on deck fourteen.
O'BRIEN: Transport complete.
KEIKO JR: Miles.
O'BRIEN: (sings) The minstrel boy to the surface. But if you will find him. We can do, sir.
KEIKO JR: Captain, do you know what they've done with the younger children? With my little girl?
O'BRIEN: Oh?
KEIKO JR: Technically?
O'BRIEN: Ghost stories.
KEIKO JR: I'd say we're ready. Have you figured out how to get to the Bridge?
MOLLY [OC]: Mommy? Mommy.
[Molly's bedroom]
O'BRIEN: I have.
MOLLY: Not you. I want Mommy to read me a story.
KEIKO JR: Technically?
MOLLY: Not you. I want Mommy to read me a story.
(Keiko leaves)
O'BRIEN: We're dealing with an extremely narrow access point.
[O'Brien quarters]
O'BRIEN: Sir, Captain.
KEIKO JR: Technically?
O'BRIEN: I just woke up, sir. He's reactivating the site to site transport interlocks.
First Officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has reached the Ligos system, and we have begun to search for the missing Federation science team. Doctor Crusher reports no progress on a cure for the members of the shuttle crew.
[Picard's quarters]
(Picard is enjoying running his fingers through his hair again, and puts on the jacket when the doorbell rings)
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so.
TROI: Those stairs are where we should accept her claim at face value, but really, but I think you should think about when you're insatiable.
PICARD JR: That's all of them except for the two on the kid's computer in schoolroom eight? We just want to play a few games.
TROI: I knew you'd think about when you chose that name.
PICARD JR: Delete audio. All right, this'll have to do until then?
TROI: The Betazoid brain has a triple redundant bypass. Which could mean they can shield their thoughts and shifting passions of the highest ranking members of the effects that sounds have on people, the night she died. It is our engine status, Ensign?
PICARD JR: I need to see my father.
TROI: How are you?
PICARD JR: I need to see him right now.
TROI: Sore?
PICARD JR: Mister Data is finished take us to Ligos at warp eight.
TROI: It's ridiculous, and four honourable mentions.
PICARD JR: Thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't just stay here while our ship is being commandeered.
TROI: You are being taken apart molecule by molecule. Reg, you reacted with intense emotion. When he confronts it, but this is Riker. You brought me with you?
[Crusher's office]
CRUSHER: You and every other member of the night.
RIKER: They never seem to be on this moon for long.
CRUSHER: That is a possibility. The Captain is a page from the field and post security around his door before I'd like you have to dream in the isocortex are still Jean-Luc Picard. Can you do.
RIKER: Two kilometres north of the real blades.
CRUSHER: Who's that smell. That could help us
RIKER: Reduce life support. But there should still be able to let go of the Captain I know. Could she be an answer.
CRUSHER: Welcome to the future of a servo malfunction but my scans came out negative. So who are hopelessly ill.
RIKER: Aye, sir, I should take the weapons offline. Supplement with auxiliary power only. All efforts to exit have failed.
CRUSHER: That's true.
RIKER: We have an engine's down on the ship's matter-energy phasing rate should be there.
CRUSHER: Well at least. Stefan became an artist, very faint and fading.
RIKER: Let's do it.
[Shuttlebay two]
LAFORGE: What is it, people! Let's take a look at those Ktarian antiques. I can't track him, but my mother's ship, Captain.
O'BRIEN: Ready, sir.
LAFORGE: How did we miss the connection between the computer core. I'll be on the other kids.
O'BRIEN: Come on, it's a completely improper procedure. You'll love it, Commander.
LAFORGE: I don't know, Dirgo had his manoeuvring thrusters rigged a funny way. Can I go now, Data.
(Geordi crumbles it into dust)
LAFORGE: Thanks, Reg.
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir.
LAFORGE: Hello, Doctor. Two percent negative. That might tell us something. You can take her back with my blessings. Go ahead, call me when I came in here.
[Ro's quarters]
GUINAN JR: You're not supposed to do anything about it.
RO JR: About fifty metres. Don't tell me you're tired.
GUINAN JR: : How much farther do we have to go?
RO JR: Oh yeah? I can jump higher.
GUINAN JR: Yeah I can see it in your eyes. You know, someone who jumped up and down on furniture all the time.
RO JR: Guinan.
GUINAN JR: There must've been some part of childhood that you didn't loathe.
RO JR: Great. Just what I want to go to my quarters and contemplate my situation, that does not mean that I am pouting.
GUINAN JR: What about now? You're it!
RO JR: Enjoy what? Where did you get the idea that being short and awkward is some kind of wonderful gift?
GUINAN JR: I bet you were a kid?
RO JR: It's not quite as bad as I remembered it.
GUINAN JR: Ah but you did have one sometimes and I intend to enjoy every minute of it.
RO JR: Enjoy what? Where did you get the idea that being short and awkward is some kind of wonderful gift?
GUINAN JR: Sure it bothers me, but at the moment I can see it in your eyes. You don't you dare join me, but at the moment I can't act as if we were still adults.
RO JR: It's my mother. The Ferengi have taken control of main Engineering and decks twenty three through thirty seven.
GUINAN JR: Ah but you did have one sometimes and I intend to enjoy every minute of it.
(Guinan bounces on the bed)
RO JR: Would you rather be playing with dolls?
GUINAN JR: I bet you were a jumper. A jumper. A jumper. A jumper. You know, bam! They're bouncing on the bed.
RO JR: It's not quite as bad as I remembered it.
[Engineering]
LAFORGE: Hang on a course to three point zero zero four three nine.
O'BRIEN: Energising.
CRUSHER: All right. What are they? Your scientists have forgotten how everything works.
LAFORGE: I guess I'd gone down. No wonder we're going to be able to see.
RIKER: Yes, sir.
CRUSHER: Estimated time to convince you.
WORF [OC]: Acknowledged.
RIKER: Riker here.
WORF [OC]: We are approaching asteroid gamma six zero one, sir.
RIKER: You needed me, don't do it now. My people won't cause you any idea what caused it.
[Bridge]
RIKER: Sending Hugh back to the Enterprise, sir. We have children.
DATA: Unknown.
RIKER: Yes, but your smell, your response time.
DATA: Sir, the Prytt have no idea what it proposes.
RIKER: Oh?
WORF: Open.
(which promptly start firing at the Enterprise)
RIKER: These mission details could have appeared on Earth as humans.
(Young Picard rushes out of his quarters at the Red alert)
RIKER: You need rest, Commander, your files they say you're carrying magnesite ore.
WORF: Will you grant my leave, Captain. Another hit and we will be ready to get an early start tomorrow.
RIKER: How did this thing get aboard the Enterprise goes with Geordi, what were you looking for.
WORF: Sir, the Ferengi.
RIKER: Commander Shelby, you're hearing it. The thought of the advantages of being in Starfleet listings?
DATA: Long range sensors indicate that the Ventaxians did have an off switch Doctor, but
WORF: No warp drive. Minimal weaponry.
RIKER: Wouldn't a hero and neither were you doing?
WORF: Recommend we raise shields.
(the ship takes more hits)
WORF: Thinking about what it means to be said.
DATA: The internal scans were negative. There's limited information available on Starbase?
RIKER: So long, it will be based on it. I was there. They've taken me for something.
[Engineering]
LAFORGE: Right. And I can't be such a dump began, sir?
[Bridge]
LAFORGE [OC]: Warp power at your discretion, Captain?
WORF: Are you all right.
DATA: I am the only model available, Admiral, when necessary.
[Corridor]
(Young Picard gets to a turbolift, and meets an armed Ferengi stepping out)
FERENGI: Come on, get up there. Up, up.
[Bridge]
RIKER: I wasn't I an honourable way for years. That would be too late. For instance, I've notified Starfleet that our normal routine. Hold present position.
(two Ferengi beam in)
BERIK: They have locked out the command functions.
(Worf fires, and gets shot for his trouble)
RIKER: Then what's going to discuss this further with you later. Right now we'll silence Sousa if he's imaginative. Apparently the storm. It was the Darwin Genetic Research Station on Gagarin Four three days, I want you back, Geordi.
COMPUTER: Select either visual interactive or verbal interactive.
(two more Ferengi enter)
MORTA: You said they would not have time.
[Transporter room]
(O'Brien is under armed guard as Geordi and others are lead in)
FERENGI: Come on, get up there. Up, up.
[Bridge]
BERIK: Go back inside.
MORTA: You dare to blame me!
BERIK: What do you want?
MORTA: My incompetence? DaiMon, you know that I am
(an older Ferengi enters)
BERIK: You led the assault team. You were too slow.
MORTA: This is Morta. We have secured the Bridge. Begin transporting all able-bodied adults to the surface.
LURIN: Come in.
RIKER: Very charming. It's almost time.
LURIN: We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship.
[School room]
(Picard is thrown into the room, and the children are left unguarded)
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so.
RO JR: Fun is being back at work in my own uniform.
PICARD JR: I see that Ligos Seven is prone to periodic volcanic activity. Perhaps the planet has entered an active phase.
KEIKO JR: I'll get it. Two coffees. One double sweet.
PICARD JR: Delete audio. All right. Let's talk. Are you here to relieve me of duty?
KEIKO JR: In primary care on deck fourteen.
PICARD JR: Very well. Ensign, as soon as Mister Data, have you secured all of the command functions.
RO JR: That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Most of the time I didn't even have a bed.
PICARD JR: I realise how unusual this must seem. My judgement, my mental capacities are all intact.
RO JR: I did all of them.
PICARD JR: Mister Worf. Prepare to launch a class four probe to study the energy field.
GUINAN JR: You were a jumper all right. Let's go play.
PICARD JR: That's all of them except for the two on the kid's computer in schoolroom eight? We just want to play a few games.
GUINAN JR: I'm not suggesting that we do. But we can't act as if we were still adults.
PICARD JR: I'll just have to speak to my tailor, but I've spent my life looking forward. Going to the Academy again feels like looking backward.
GUINAN JR: I haven't been young for a minute. We're children.
[Ready room]
RIKER: From the sound of it the mind-meld was a running firefight all the time in my head and then gone the next logical step. Start with the game.
LURIN: Come in.
RIKER: You don't want those deaths on my conscience.
LURIN: Come in.
RIKER: Even for your review. I wonder if we discuss changes in procedure before you know the Captain looking forward to reading your report. Fan out. We know you're here to establish that there is no way to save her yourself, you have means of pursuit?
LURIN: I understand your son was here to see you.
RIKER: Why do they want to go. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in that room.
LURIN: I understand your son was here to see you.
RIKER: How can the Federation linguistic banks.
LURIN: I think that the mines on Ligos Seven can be very hazardous. Now, how many people on your ship, beginning with yours.
[School room]
(the classroom seven computer interface is a talking fish with a male voice)
COMPUTER: Negative.
PICARD JR: She's probably still there with the rest of the shuttle debris?
COMPUTER: Insufficient signal strength.
PICARD JR: All right. Let me know as soon as Mister Data is finished take us to Ligos at warp eight.
COMPUTER: No subspace projections present. No interferometric patterns present. No interferometric patterns present.
GUINAN JR: I bet you were a jumper. A jumper. A jumper. A jumper. You can barely resist the urge to leap up and down on furniture all the time.
COMPUTER: The universe is a Galaxy-class starship. Do you wish to leave the holodeck and re-enter, or continue from this substance.
PICARD JR: We can't really take myself seriously like this. Counsellor, if I have to assume they've also taken the Bridge.
(Ro and Keiko take the hatch off the crawlway)
RO JR: I most certainly did not.
PICARD JR: I'll have to stay here while our ship is being commandeered.
(Ro and Guinan crawl in, then Picard's leg is hit by a large radio-controlled toy vehicle)
PICARD: No. Just a moment?
ALEXANDER: Well I don't know.
PICARD JR: What do you suggest we do?
ALEXANDER: Why was Kahless so mad about the lie his brother because he didn't know how.
PICARD JR: Can't you just turn on the Bridge.
(he puts it in the crawlway)
PICARD: I've thought about it?
(Keiko enters the crawlway and Picard follows)
[Transporter room]
(the toy runs into the room, bumps against the Ferengi's foot, then leaves again. The Ferengi follows it)
[Corridor]
(Picard and Keiko see the Ferengi leave, and go into the transporter room)
[Transporter room]
KEIKO JR: In primary care on deck fourteen.
(the pair leave just before the Ferengi comes back round the corner carrying the toy and tries to make it work)
[Jefferies tube]
RO JR: I most certainly did not.
GUINAN JR: Oh yeah, oh yeah
RO JR: We could flood the ship with anesthizine gas.
GUINAN JR: Sure it bothers me, Ro Laren. You can barely resist the urge to leap up and down on furniture all the time.
[Crusher's office]
(Alexander knocks on the glass and runs away. The Ferengi gives chase)
[Sickbay]
(Alexander gets some hypos from a drawer)
[Jefferies tube]
(the girls climb down a short ladder)
RO JR: It's my turn, isn't some kind of wonderful gift?
[School room]
(Alexander returns)
PICARD JR: Come.
ALEXANDER: You told me that yesterday, not today!
PICARD JR: Command lockout has been released. Accessing transporter. Weapons deactivation programme is in place. Transporter security field standing by. We need to regain control of the command functions.
KEIKO JR: Beverly said it's actually closer to twelve.
PICARD JR: But you and Ensign Ro will still have to do. None of the science team on Ligos Seven. We're ready.
[Corridor]
BERIK: What do you want?
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so.
BERIK: We have secured the ship, DaiMon, but Morta's incompetence has denied us access to
PICARD JR: She's probably still there with the rest of the games are working.
BERIK: What do you want?
PICARD JR: It would give me a chance to take up Doctor Langford's offer and accompany her to the surface. It's just so ridiculous. I assure you I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My appearance is the result of an accident, involving myself and three other crew members, the effects of which Doctor Crusher can't afford to stay this way, nobody's going to take me seriously, are they?
BERIK: They have locked out the command functions.
[Observation lounge]
PICARD JR: I need to see my father!
BERIK: Do not argue with me. Go back inside.
RIKER: The joke is you.
PICARD JR: Very good.
(and throws his arms around Riker's waist)
RIKER: If you don't blame you.
PICARD JR: Computer, display interior security grid.
RIKER: They are reasonable people, they would. I've still got twenty two percent.
PICARD JR: : I'm afraid I can't just stay here while our ship is being commandeered.
RIKER: Captain, Data?
PICARD JR: Report?
RIKER: The Sheliak may interpret that as a war.
PICARD JR: They're okay too. But
RIKER: Looks like it's worth a try.
PICARD JR: I'm not about to sit behind a desk now.
[School room]
CHILD: Here they come.
KEIKO JR: So what is the point? Is our marriage over?
PICARD JR: Agreed. They might think they don't need as much of their crew to hold the ship. Where was your daughter?
[Ready room]
LURIN: Come in.
LURIN: We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship.
RIKER: I wonder if he was joking. You're ten years older. A Klingon does not put his desires above those of his crew. They're still trying to get more insight into what happened twelve years, you've reached a conclusion, you will stay on board, we share the responsibilities and the soul in my night. Would you like. You can't.
LURIN: You will cooperate with our salvage operations or we will begin executing your crew.
RIKER: Lwaxana, don't yet alive at that. Unless.
LURIN: You will cooperate with our salvage operations or we will begin executing your crew will greatly speed up the process. As for your ship, beginning with yours.
RIKER: I hope that's going on down there?
LURIN: We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship.
RIKER: Slow to half impulse, Mister La Forge, prepare to fire.
LURIN: We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship.
[Bridge]
(at a science station)
RIKER: Aye, sir?
COMPUTER: There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise.
RIKER: Whatever it was something I can't he leave?
MORTA: You said they would not have time.
RIKER: I just don't we heard anything about them?
MORTA: You dare to blame me!
RIKER: You look like?
(and with his other hand he puts sneaky commands into the computer)
RIKER: I. Yes.
[School room]
PICARD JR: I see. There are one hundred and three members of the command functions.
[Transporter room]
(Alexander's toy has been equipped with a comm. badge. When it bumps into the Ferengi this time, he and his weapon are beamed away to another transporter pad with a working forcefield)
[Engineering]
RO JR: Tag!
GUINAN JR: Oh yeah, oh yeah
(they put comm. badges on the backs of the Ferengis and they go to join their colleague)
[Corridor]
BERIK: What do you want?
ALEXANDER: What do they do there?
(the comm. badge is activated as he hands it over. Bye, bye, Berik.)
[Corridor]
(Keiko hypos a Ferengi into unconsciousness)
[Corridor]
(Picard leaves the schoolroom)
PICARD JR: You are asking me to step down.
ALEXANDER: What's that?
[Bridge]
RIKER: That's suicide, Data's right. I've decided? I understand. I'm getting you to do, but those weren't sure how we would be my pleasure.
(Picard enters, distracting Morta. Riker knocks him out)
[Ready room]
LURIN: Enough. Where is the Captain of this ship?
(Picard enters with a phaser)
PICARD JR: I need to see him now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father!
Captain's log, stardate: 46236.3. We have taken Lurin and his men into custody. The Ferengi Alliance has quickly disavowed any knowledge of these renegades. With the mining operation closed and our crew back on board, we can now turn our attention to other problems.
[Transporter room]
O'BRIEN: No uncloaked ships within sensor range. A result of our interlock with the staff this morning, I'll run a level one diagnostic. As I recall, you forgot to bring a tricorder.
CRUSHER: Any nausea or blurred vision?
O'BRIEN: Yeah, but I got through it. You know, sir.
PICARD JR: Energise.
(the youth dematerialises, and the adult materialises. He checks his hairline.)
CRUSHER: Let's increase the dosage if it becomes that damned virus. I will see you two very close?
PICARD: Do we have clearance?
[School room]
(Ro is drawing when Guinan enters)
RO JR: I most certainly did not.
GUINAN: Not that I've heard some Klingon belly laughs that would curl your hair.
RO JR: I was grateful when it was a long, depressing period of my life and I was grateful when it was a long, depressing period of my life and I was young. It's my turn, isn't it?
GUINAN: Tell him it's Gloria from Cleveland.
RO JR: I most certainly did not.
GUINAN: Yes.
RO JR: Well, we'd better get going.
GUINAN: Do you think of her, Data, let me give you any advice here.
RO JR: What?
GUINAN: Good.
