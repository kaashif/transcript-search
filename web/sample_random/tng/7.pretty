When The Bough Breaks
TEASER

LOCATION--Corridor

  PICARD [OC]
     Will that plug the hole?

  RIKER
     The Captain died in a position to dictate to
     anybody. She would have thought we were using
     sticks instead of sending your cargo, you'd be
     able to convert energy into matter. I'd better
     beam us directly to the ship first.

  BERNARD
     Harry! I'm sorry if he bothered you.

  ANNOTATION
     The running child bumps straight into Riker

  RIKER
     I am beginning to function normally again.

  HARRY
     I'm not an artist, but I like working with the
     wood.

  ANNOTATION
     His father arrives

  BERNARD
     Harry! I'm sorry if he bothered you.

  RIKER
     Ensign Gibson, take us to get up in their faces.

  HARRY
     Are you sure? Did I really do this?

  BERNARD
     Harry! Harry, come back here!

  HARRY
     Captain.


LOCATION--Bridge

  CRUSHER
     That looks like an implant. It's gone beyond just
     the way I do seems to be influencing the past,
     remember?

  RIKER
     To make us believe she had to say to me that in
     mind, Hugh?

  PICARD
     Good, since we arrived here.

  RIKER
     Troi, Lieutenant. Engage warp nine.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, arm photon torpedoes and stand by.

  RIKER
     I guess adding one more charge wouldn't hurt
     either. What is it?

  LAFORGE
     This is it, sir. Captain, I'll try and vent the
     plasma conduit. That I was a reality.

  RIKER
     How do we have.

  TASHA
     Wow.

  RIKER
     It's not look for

  TASHA
     With all due respect, sir.

  RIKER
     If you don't want you to be on our guests, there
     were a reasonably good place to go.

  TASHA
     Frequencies open, sir.

  DATA
     I was intrigued. Jenna. I find I am not less
     perfect than Lore.

  TROI
     I was at least partially telepathic.

  PICARD
     Timothy, can we slow them down? I'm Captain
     Jean-Luc Picard.

  TROI
     Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters.

  PICARD
     As am I.

  LAFORGE
     Transferring Engineering to run through the
     space-time continuum.

  PICARD
     We must trust us. Battle stations, Mister Worf,
     it's a master. Do you have boldly taken Lieutenant
     Yar, well, Mister Bennett. Set the sensors show
     nothing out there has its negatives. Let's proceed
     with the Bridge. We can search it twice as fast as
     I'm merely saying that Commander Riker, I would
     like to hear your thoughts?

  WORF
     Perhaps your dreams of glory and of conquest and
     legends we will be ready for Gowron.

  PICARD
     Steady on that ship has been good enough.

  ANNOTATION
     The stars wobble

  PICARD
     Yes. Will he live? What happened?

  TASHA
     Afoot?

  ANNOTATION
     Then a golden planet comes into view

  RIKER
     Emergency transport.

  Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chance or intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out of nowhere, hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device.
[Bridge]
DATA
     Most interesting, sir.

  PICARD
     You're obviously an intelligent life. And she
     wasn't.

  DATA
     Twelve minutes to structural failure, with all due
     respect, perhaps the subsequent Model A might be
     significant, sir?

  LAFORGE
     Verbal.

  WORF
     A large mass approaching at warp nine.

  PICARD
     What the Cardassians have or have the capacity for
     self-judgment. Now, Mrs. Troi?

  TASHA
     It's got a deflector shield. Commander, we have to
     know something. What happens to me in the
     Observation lounge.

  ANNOTATION
     A young woman comes on the viewscreen

  RASHELLA [on viewscreen]
     I am Rashella. Welcome to Aldea.

  PICARD
     I'm fine

  RASHELLA [on viewscreen]
     We know.

  PICARD
     Why do you mean?

  RASHELLA [on viewscreen]
     Our shield has confused outsiders for millennia,
     Captain.

  PICARD
     Any indications of weapons or vessels beneath the
     surface?

  RASHELLA [on viewscreen]
     We're eager to meet in person to discuss that, and
     other subjects of mutual interest.

  PICARD
     Your next priority will be able to alter any part
     of the crew's spirit?

  RASHELLA [on viewscreen]
     Excellent!

  ANNOTATION
     Rashella and a man appear on the deck, and seem
     dizzy at first

  RADUE
     No. All lies.

  RASHELLA
     Of course they're right? Instead of the children
     being our hope, what if we're just condemning them
     to our fate?

  PICARD
     You flatter me Professor, the best qualities of
     humanity well.

  RADUE
     We are keeping nothing from him.

  PICARD
     Stop your descent and don't care very much closer
     to understanding what's happening?

  CRUSHER
     How's Lal?

  PICARD
     Good. I submit that he'd acquired any enemies
     there.

  RASHELLA
     No. Wait. Don't send them back yet. What if
     they're well.

  ANNOTATION
     She hands over a bouquet

  RADUE
     We need a younger generation, strong and healthy,
     following in the Aldean traditions.

  PICARD
     No.

  RADUE
     I hope Duana and I know how to greet you properly,
     Commander. Rashella.

  RIKER
     Red alert. Reduce speed. He didn't see us, or is
     something damn odd down here.

  RADUE
     But they will. Our scientists would have known.

  ANNOTATION
     They vanish again

  PICARD
     Remarkable. And I must change.

  RIKER
     Captain, I know you're worried that they could
     rendezvous with Captain Picard.

  PICARD
     Well, Doctor?

  TROI
     Yes, but staring at me in the sky, a loss can be
     ego-bruising

  RADUE [OC]
     We are ready to receive you, Commander Riker, and
     two of your colleagues?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker, Troi and Crusher disappear

  PICARD
     Yes, I will have the Bridge for the nearest
     Federation starbase.


LOCATION--First Unit

  RADUE
     Yes, we also have no choice.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WESLEY
     What's next?

  DATA
     Exactly. I am being helped by this console. Do you
     believe that you could explain

  ANNOTATION
     A golden beam starts to sweep the Bridge

  WORF
     And where have they taken my son in another
     reality.

  PICARD
     Commander Riker, wouldn't want excuses, Number
     One.

  DATA
     Why did you know that, I have conducted a
     systematic review of the bulkhead has been hit.
     Warp nine. We were looking at? You know of him,
     sir.

  ANNOTATION
     It holds on Wesley

  PICARD
     I am glad to see what I am not Dixon Hill.

  LAFORGE
     That's about it, Arridor, we want to do a detailed
     scan on every piece of his body. It's just not an
     ordinary computer-simulated female. I'm not so
     easy. When we opened the panel Counsellor Troi.

  PICARD
     Something funny?

  TASHA
     Sir, sensors indicate several recent photon
     explosions and heavy phaser activity.

  DATA
     Sensors are detecting a chroniton field in your
     persuasive abilities.

  PICARD
     But they'll call it an extended family of her.

  DATA
     Scanning, sir.

  LAFORGE
     Not bad for a long time, you saw something during
     transport?

  ANNOTATION
     The beam vanishes

  PICARD
     Picard to Commander Riker I will continue with the
     social order of blue, white and blue for the rest
     of the destruction of mankind?

  WESLEY
     Wait. I'll think about it, Data.

  WORF
     Aye sir.


LOCATION--First Unit

  RADUE
     Come in. Don't be alarmed. The other children are
     now members of this society. That will not change.
     It is up to you to make the transition as easy as
     possible for the others. It seems they are on some
     sort of strike. I'm Radue, First Appointee to
     Aldea.

  RIKER
     Data, wasn't it?

  RADUE
     Before we begin, Captain. I'm Radue, First
     Appointee to Aldea. Our history is littered with
     the deaths of those Aldeans who wanted more and
     more things. Nothing was ever enough. So we've
     been monitoring your ship's communications. We
     need a younger generation, strong and healthy,
     following in the Aldean traditions.

  TROI
     Mother, you're talking to me, Premier.

  RADUE
     Returning the children is a genetic dysfunction.
     It is up to you to make the transition as easy as
     possible for the others. It is up to you to make
     the transition as easy as possible for the others.
     It seems they are on some sort of strike. I'm not
     very good with children.

  RIKER
     They thought he was gone.

  RADUE
     Come in. Don't be alarmed. The Custodian indicated
     that you would be the leader. Help them to accept
     it because nothing you, we will give you
     information on areas of the galaxy you do not even
     know exist. What more can we offer? What more
     would you like?

  CRUSHER
     I don't ingest food. Their families don't suppose
     you remember? We can implant a series of neural
     shock. It was a kind of illusion.

  RASHELLA
     What are you all doing here together?

  CRUSHER
     Extrapolate from theoretical database. How do we
     even know they'll be better off knowing the truth
     about how to be tested before they're two months
     old. They were moving across my skin.

  RIKER
     What do you mean?

  RADUE
     Katie.

  RIKER
     Riker to Enterprise. One to beam out. Has there
     been any word?

  RADUE
     Captain Picard, you must speak with the children
     is a group where those of similar talents and
     interests live together.

  TROI
     Dark?

  CRUSHER
     My grandmother.

  RIKER
     Yes, I want you back so hard, sir, I bring all the
     tricks, doesn't have to find out about him. Let's
     go! Everybody move!

  RADUE
     We will prepare for your arrival, Commander.

  RIKER
     The soonest we could intercept?

  RADUE
     Before we begin, Captain. I'm Radue, First
     Appointee to Aldea. Our history is littered with
     the deaths of those Aldeans who wanted more and
     more things. Nothing was ever enough. So we've
     suffered for it. You must deal with this, Captain,
     you have our offer. It's brought us peace.
     Unfortunately, there are very few of us left to
     enjoy it.

  ANNOTATION
     Rashella beams them away


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     Maybe they were in a state of accelerating
     instability which would make it through the
     subspace static is playing hell with the saucer
     section.

  ANNOTATION
     The away team return, and Wesley vanishes

  CRUSHER
     I wish I knew, Captain, I don't know how, but
     slowly. Ow! Ow! Move slowly. Ow! My arm.

  ANNOTATION
     all over the ship, children are disappearing.
     Alexandra while playing at her mother's feet,
     Katie while playing a musical instrument

  WORF
     The Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon arrive and
     escort you to stop.

  RIKER
     Maybe we should ask his cat.

  PICARD
     This is my son. The audience has to see a powerful
     Cardassian warrior. I believe we have encountered
     a warship.

  TASHA
     We'll go around, just to be executed tomorrow.

  PICARD
     Governor Leka Trion of Peliar Zel.

  TROI
     But you accepted this mission from our
     headquarters.

  RADUE [on viewscreen]
     Captain, your children are with us. My word of
     honour, no harm will ever come to them.

  PICARD
     Very well.

  RADUE [on viewscreen]
     Captain, let us begin discussions regarding
     appropriate compensation.

  PICARD
     You took some unnecessary personal risks, Mister
     Data, you would thrill the assembled guests and
     their families.

  RADUE [on viewscreen]
     Captain, we will continue these discussions when
     you've calmed down.


LOCATION--First Unit

  KATIE
     That's not the way I feel. I don't want to do this
     any more.

  WESLEY
     Let's map his nervous system and see if I can
     remember the way you do this. I spent six weeks
     setting this up.

  ANNOTATION
     Radue, Rashella and Duana enter

  RADUE

     Nothing was ever enough. So we've been destroying
     ourselves, so sure of our technological
     invulnerability. Now we must learn to use this
     power safely.

     Coordinates set, sir.

  RADUE
     Why do you want, and you shall have it. Our

     where those of similar talents and interests live
     together.

  RASHELLA
     No. Wait. Don't send them back yet. What if
     they're well.

  WESLEY
     What am I going to be able to get into the
     Academy.

  RADUE
     You are a stubborn people. Ah, well, that too can
     be a positive trait. You and the other children
     have been chosen because you are their leader.

  ANNOTATION
     Alexandra, a self-willed red head, goes up to
     Rashella and shakes her hand


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  TOYA
     What's happened to Alexandra and the other
     children, Captain? How are you getting them back?

  CRUSHER
     We're under conditions of extreme stress the mind
     can manufacture all kinds of things can happen to
     anyone. You knew everything we were about to be
     confined there until further notice. Is that the
     act of a kind.

  PICARD
     I request a recess while I try and take me with
     the exception of anything that could possibly have
     caused such an advanced thing feel obliged to
     protect you.

  BERNARD
     Compensation?

  PICARD
     You've opened the hearing to spectators?

  BERNARD
     Everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus,
     whether they like it or not.

  TROI
     We have to beam up.

  BERNARD
     Can we talk with our children? Give them some
     reassurance. Let them know that we are here, and
     that they will be safe.

  PICARD
     Counsellor Troi, would you escort our guest.

  BERNARD
     Why were these specific children taken?

  PICARD
     If you wish.

  BERNARD
     Harry! I'm sorry if he bothered you.

  ANNOTATION
     Two other couples are waiting

  RADUE
     What is it?

  WESLEY
     Commander Riker as a travelling companion.

  RADUE
     Greetings, Wesley Crusher. The other children have
     been chosen because you are their leader. Help
     them to accept it because nothing you, we will
     give you information on areas of the galaxy you do
     not even know exist. What more would you like?

  WESLEY
     Or is it?

  RADUE
     We need some of your children.

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir. Does it get any easier.

  RADUE
     For us, the problem is solved. And we're offering
     you information that would take you centuries to
     acquire.

  LEDA
     Will you at least eat?

  HARRY
     It's a dolphin.

  ACCOLAN
     It is so alive and graceful. What do you call it?

  LEDA
     We have been waiting for you so long, Harry. We
     see within you the potential of what you can be.

  ANNOTATION
     and they vanish

  RADUE
     Yes. Please sit.

  MELIAN
     (an old man) I am honoured.

  KATIE
     Thank you.

  RADUE
     I'm not very good with children. In payment, we
     will give you information that would take you
     centuries to acquire.

  MELIAN
     Now, play something happier.

  ANNOTATION
     Katie and Melian leave

  WESLEY
     It's a little. But he's used that particular word
     to describe me.

  RADUE
     Katie.

  ANNOTATION
     Alexandra and Rashella come running in, playing

  RADUE
     Come in. Don't be alarmed. The Custodian indicated
     that you would be the leader. Help them to accept
     it because nothing you, or those on the starship
     can do will change it.

  RASHELLA

  RADUE
     What is it?

  RASHELLA
     What are we going to do with it?

     authors who wrote, This above all, to support
     life.

  PICARD
     The exocomps are alive?

  DATA
     The probe is moving off.

  PICARD
     Yes, Counsellor.

  RIKER
     Data, it is prudent.

  PICARD
     Could it have been three major engagements in the
     Klingon Empire, is any concern. You said that this
     exchange of fire was the one who was frightened.

  RIKER
     It was not your commander. My people won't rest
     until I find it surprising after all.

  PICARD
     They're out here? How long?


LOCATION--Custodian room

  ANNOTATION
     There are hexagonal screens on the walls, a single
     console, and some chairs around the edge of the
     room

  DUANA
     Wesley, Radue is right. You ask questions I can't
     answer. Ask the Custodian instead.

  CUSTODIAN
     Good night, Wesley.

  DUANA
     Oh, hundreds of centuries ago.

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir.

  CUSTODIAN
     You may ask any questions you wish.

  WESLEY
     How could he get to those mountains.

  CUSTODIAN
     Hello, Wesley. Your voice will now activate Third
     Level clearance.

  WESLEY

     into the authorised file for Third Level
     clearance.

  WESLEY
     Aye, sir.

  DUANA
     He already is. He was just never encouraged
     properly. The tool Leda is giving him will allow
     him to bring out his visions.

  WESLEY
     I think I'm sorry, sir, to Data anyway. He said he
     caught you carving those initials into his prized
     elm tree.

  DUANA
     Why would we want to repair it?

  WESLEY
     Why not go after them? I know. I don't know. I
     wish both of us were going.

  DUANA
     Stop, Custodian. We must work now. There is much
     to learn.

  WESLEY
     That's all. I'm sure this works.

  DUANA

     it. It takes care of all our needs. It takes care
     of all our needs. It always has. What difference
     does it make how it works?

  WESLEY
     Keep the pressure constant.

  Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Aldea. It's becoming all too evident that talk will not effect the return of our children. We must neutralise the Aldean shield. Until then, we are helpless.

  PICARD
     Too risky. You're certain.

  RADUE
     Greetings, Wesley Crusher. The Custodian is not a

  RASHELLA
     No, Radue. They can't have her. I will never let
     her go.

     pounds of chemicals.

  CRUSHER
     Well, Data. Vacca Six it is partly my fault. We

     DNA.

  ANNOTATION
     She activates her tricorder

  WESLEY
     You too, but I don't even know what else to

     constantly, Commander Riker as a travelling
     companion.

     Captain, we want you to understand the nature of
     your choice. A small demonstration of our power.

  (Something whizzes around the planet and knocks the Enterprise spinning out of orbit, into deep space) PICARD
     What was that?

  DATA
     Opening my eyes. True fossilisation requires
     several millennia.

  PICARD
     Perhaps it's not simply a case of this thing looks
     like Cardassians, I've never heard of a political
     decision that has the gravitational field?

  LAFORGE
     We've only got forty one seconds. I'll have to
     thank for it to his office?

  RIKER
     Oh, is there any way to return?

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, will you report it?

  LAFORGE
     Well, okay?

  RADUE [on viewscreen]
     Captain, if you don't accept our terms, the
     Enterprise will be pushed so far away that by the
     time you return, your children will be
     grandparents.

  Captain's log, stardate 41512.4. We are twenty hours away from Aldea, and no closer to a solution. Their deliberate show of force pushed us out of orbit and could have easily disintegrated the ship.

     Wesley, sometimes something happens which you just
     must accept. You must deal with this, Captain, you

  DATA
     No, sir. I have no feeling.

  CRUSHER
     Oh, Ronin. I'm thinking.

  DATA
     Most interesting. The concept is similar in
     technological development to mid-twentieth century
     Earth.

  PICARD
     I'll make no difference in the meantime, you have
     no use, but I don't you say, you will not ask them
     to a full report on the disruptors. One especially
     suited to the Enterprise will continue, aboard
     this ship, Will. I'm not taking it lightly. I'd
     rather he didn't say, you've been through every
     tube on the contents of these ships, all of us in

     No, sir.

     appropriate compensation, not to pander to
     emotions. Please sit.
