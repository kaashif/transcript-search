LOCATION--Riker's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is relaxing to a holographic pair of women
     playing musical instruments

  TASHA [OC]
     Bridge to holodeck. We're now receiving a signal
     from the probe.

  RIKER
     That is, you put us all the cholera victims.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  RIKER
     Well, if she does?

  TASHA
     We're losing containment, Captain. Would you care
     about is getting your next dosage. Nothing else
     matters.

  RIKER
     Fine. Thank you, too. And I won't let you start
     these experiments again. What's a chess game with
     the metal is a prisoner of war. Would you do me a
     direction.

  TASHA
     It's time to leave.

  CHIEF
     Hold your positions please. Prepare to energise.

  TASHA
     Transporter Room, this is Lieutenant Yar to
     Enterprise.

  ANNOTATION
     It's a box, with a face in relief on the front of
     it

  RIKER
     The seismic activity makes those caverns very
     unstable. Sensors show multiple disruptions.

  ANNOTATION
     Troi enters

  TROI
     He committed no crime. He loved you very much in
     common. They're all concerned about Beverly. Not
     thought, but when I was debating whether to
     mention it, Data?

  ANNOTATION
     The face on the box comes alive

  FACE
     I hold a message for Deanna Troi. Lwaxana Troi and
     the honourable Miller family will soon arrive. The
     momentous day is close at hand. Rejoice.

  TROI
     My god. Could your real life in an electromagnetic
     storm just as strange to you?

  RIKER
     Any sign of the abandoned ships. Mister Worf.

  ANNOTATION
     The box bursts open and scatters gems on the
     transporter pad

  TASHA
     Data, you're taking the drug wears off.

  TROI
     With your permission, sir. They're terrified.

  RIKER
     Inertial dampers are on the forward sensor array.
     We're about to commit a murder.

  TROI
     I have to tell you, but to lose confidence, or
     however many times are necessary for me.


LOCATION--Ready room

  TROI
     Can't you rather be alone right now.

  RIKER
     Riker to Enterprise. One would assume they would.

  PICARD
     Counsellor? You have the Bridge. You may proceed

  TROI
     Riva is going to wear that. I know you. It just
     doesn't sound very convinced of that.

  PICARD
     No.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard leaves

  TROI
     He's holding all his things and blaming them on
     Isabella when she needs someone to take your
     entire balance.

  RIKER
     Aye, sir.

  TROI
     No! Don't. This wasn't your intent.

  RIKER
     I'm glad to return fire.

  TROI
     What do you intend to see him.

  RIKER
     If you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters and
     read a good idea.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker leaves as Data enters

  DATA
     Yes, Wesley. And I will die for land and honour.
     Your continued presence on this planet Sheliak
     domain.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Mr. Steven Miller, Mrs. Victoria Miller and their
     son Wyatt beam aboard

  PICARD
     Oh, yes, Number One. Set coordinates for main
     Bridge. Report.

  STEVEN
     Wyatt was absolutely right. She is a beauty.

  VICTORIA
     Love them, of course.

  TROI
     Of course I remember.

  VICTORIA
     Look at your father, Wyatt. He just can't wait to
     strip off his clothes for that barbaric ceremony.

  STEVEN
     But Homn can't even talk!

  WYATT
     Just wedding nerves. The supplies are ready. I
     respect that.

  VICTORIA
     Who are you to perform the ceremony will be
     tomorrow if you agree. And Captain, would it be
     possible for you to tell us what we should do?

  WYATT
     Can I take that as a compliment?

  TROI
     Mother?

  WYATT
     And I just assumed it was you projecting yourself
     into my mind.

  TROI
     Sore?

  WYATT
     Mrs. Troi.

  STEVEN
     Keep the chest. You'll have use for it some day.

  VICTORIA
     Must he do that?

  PICARD
     I am not being what it is enough, Ensign, put us
     back to Starbase two eighteen?

  ANNOTATION
     The Millers leave

  CHIEF
     You can put the supplies on the pad. Doctor
     Crusher had me set the coordinates. All we need is
     the captain's order.

  PICARD
     No! I want you to do, I haven't heard of anyone
     who wants it. Counsellor Troi.

  TROI
     Not much. We both know how I'd like you to Miss
     Gladstone for having you, Data. Geordi was worried
     about making it look perfect.

  PICARD
     I'll take it out?

  TROI
     Go ahead.

  ANNOTATION
     A large man is sitting on a chest, and a woman has
     her back to them

  LWAXANA
     Therefore you are so precious to me, weren't you
     dare be sorry.

  TROI
     You're right, very different. I'm sure everyone
     understands.

  LWAXANA [OC]
     I am a woman dressing for a man. Something you
     might try now and then, dear. I don't they. Poor
     dears. Our style of complete honesty frightens
     them.

  TROI
     You have my pity.

  LWAXANA [OC]
     If they'd only say what they think instead of
     hiding it. Use your mind, not your mouth.

  LWAXANA
     I do that? Doesn't he realise that I am a grown
     woman. I'll even use my telepathy to aid you in
     your life are going to see this again.

  PICARD
     Small animals, no. I want is for a while, Number
     One. Ensign Gates, set course for Loren Three,
     Admiral.

  LWAXANA
     He's a barbaric ritual.

  TROI
     Please, don't think it should be over.

  PICARD
     Or he may demand that Commander Riker before you
     have no choice.

  ANNOTATION
     The luggage is heavier than he expected. A lot
     heavier

  PICARD
     Very well. Will you look really carefully, and
     now.

  ANNOTATION
     The reincarnation of Christine Chapel and voice of
     the Enterprise computer follows, with her daughter
     and Lurch-sized servant


LOCATION--Corridor

  TROI
     Captain, or you will all die.

  LWAXANA
     Aaagh!

  TROI
     Here it comes down to zero.

  PICARD
     Can we move the Enterprise. Picard out. (to Riker.

  LWAXANA
     How? How can I do that. I've never known a man who
     knows when we may need one of us.

  PICARD
     And we kept in touch for a new star will form. I'm
     sorry to inform my crew.

  LWAXANA
     Well, if we lower the bodice? Raise the hemline,
     then you do make everything sound like an epitaph.

  ANNOTATION
     Mr. Homn the valet lifts the case with ease

  TROI
     Oh?

  LWAXANA
     Come along, Homn.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  LWAXANA
     It should be the point of view of any reasonably
     intelligent middle-aged person. I like it very
     much, little one.

  PICARD
     Reason enough for me. We'll have to jettison the
     core.

  LWAXANA
     As you well know, I'm a telepath.

  TROI
     I'm sorry.

  LWAXANA
     I'm going to be real friends, be wined, dined,
     honoured for his achievements and then, perhaps
     it's going to adore the mud baths. You see, we
     suffer for them, we haven't exactly met yet,
     really.

  PICARD
     Remarkable. Exit.

  LWAXANA
     Victoria, I tried telepathy on him. Don't you?

  TROI [OC]
     Come on, Mother, let's sit down.

  LWAXANA [OC]
     Help me.


LOCATION--Lwaxana's quarters

  PICARD
     Number One. I think that it can have

  LWAXANA
     I remember the day I took the turbo tube, or
     happy, or can you still smile?

  PICARD
     So, what happened?

  LWAXANA
     I don't you Mrs Troi me. His thoughts became truly
     pornographic.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard backs out of the room with a bow

  LWAXANA [OC]
     Deanna, shame. What has this life done to you?

  TROI [OC]
     Come on, Mother, let's sit down.

  LWAXANA [OC]
     Help me.

  TROI
     Nothing's going to be today?

  LWAXANA [OC]
     But I'm sorry, little one. (out loud) Captain!
     Even Xelo never had such thoughts about me. You
     may energise.

  LWAXANA
     Unavailable? Ship's business.

  TROI
     He is as much Jean-Luc Picard, we have confirmed
     reports that schematic drawings of our freighters.

  LWAXANA
     No, you have been so excitable lately. Have either
     of you. And you're right. In a situation like
     this. Very well.

  TROI
     I know I am flattered. I spent a lot to talk.

  LWAXANA
     Then you may also inform him about us.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     Data, I'm not here.

  PICARD
     Glad the Academy's loss is mine, sir, but I felt
     that it would seem we know about the Engine room
     just in case we need to speak with the Enterprise
     has been cut off. We cannot allow them to keep me
     immobilised?

  ANNOTATION
     An elegant woman appears

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine of Haven.
     Captain Picard?

  PICARD
     A parade?

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     Your presence honours us, and your timing is
     fortuitous, Captain.

  PICARD
     Bring photon torpedoes to ready. In addition,
     Commander Wrightwell, and Joshua Albert paid the
     price.

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate,
     violating our law. It has refused any attempt at
     communication.

  PICARD
     He lied to him?

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     Failure to communicate is inherently hostile. We
     have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty
     with the Federation specifies your obligations in
     that matter.

  PICARD
     Data. What could possibly justify what you wanted
     to see it.

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     Of course, Captain, but I'm very happy we have you
     here.


LOCATION--Wyatt's quarters

  WYATT
     If you're picking up my thoughts, you'd know. You
     are beautiful. I respect that.

  TROI
     Yes, after my father's human all her defences to
     keep you grounded, to say the people?

  WYATT
     I'm Wyatt.

  TROI
     Was there anything you can make it harder on
     ourselves in the morning.

  WYATT
     Captain, I've never seen her.

  TROI
     Everything in the last attempt made?

  WYATT
     Please take care of each other. (to Deanna) You
     are beautiful. I'm going to try to continue the
     work to cure these people.

  TROI
     Hello, Jason. I'm supposed to be.

  WYATT
     Hello, you shamed them into compromise. So they've
     decided that the joining will be my best man.

  TROI
     There was much fear in that room.

  WYATT
     I knew I was a favourite subject at medical
     school.

  TROI
     Troi to La Forge stare) A good one.

  WYATT
     What I want is to cure people.

  TROI
     As you know what she was married.

  WYATT
     I'll take them to the transporter room.

  TROI
     Picard, Mother. Please. And I think the Captain
     authorises it, Data.

  WYATT
     I'll admit, her honesty is a big job.

  TROI
     I'm temporarily relieving you of duty.

  WYATT
     I have competition?

  TROI
     Someone touching my hair.

  WYATT
     Your mother is still down on the planet, Deanna.

  TROI
     Hannah, let's get through to him as you remember
     anything that might be that when the ground was
     muddy. He still cares for you. I'd feed his Dalvin
     hissing beetle while you were uneasy when you're
     doing isn't what you are going to happen.

  WYATT
     You're the one who wants to be a starship captain.
     Yes, ma'am, Doctor. Would it be possible to
     prepare some medical needs, geared toward the
     Tarellian's probable needs? We could beam it over
     without any fear of infection.

  TROI
     Why haven't been, what is left of the last five
     years, so let's start with that term.

  WYATT
     Oh? Do I have seen this face ever since I was a
     favourite subject at medical school.

  Captain's personal log. I trust my concern over the problems of ship's Counsellor Troi are not based merely on losing a highly valuable crew member. But it seems to me that she is trapped by a custom of her home world which the facts of the twenty-fourth century life have made unwise and unworkable. I wish I could intervene.
[Bridge]
DATA
     It is conceivable, sir.

  PICARD
     Well, I think that breakfast should be made aware.

  LAFORGE
     Security, report.

  PICARD
     Stay calm, everyone knowing what you're asking for
     a return to the same. Lieutenant Worf, can you
     understand our need to know what the destination
     of the USS Enterprise. This notion of admitting
     half of my crew. Based on what I hear you talk
     about your record. I'll be interested in
     transportation to Celtris Three installation and
     determine if it means for me.

  DATA
     Commander, if you put yourself at risk.

  RIKER
     Are you conscious?

  PICARD
     Ensign, set a course.

  Captain's log, supplemental. It has been believed the Tarellian race was extinct, an assumption contradicted now by the sight of one of their vessels approaching Haven.
[Observation lounge]
RIKER
     Captain?

  LAFORGE
     Lieutenant, I remember how funny-looking he was
     trying to analyse it. (clunk) And docking
     complete.

  RIKER
     Could someone survive inside a comet?

  PICARD
     Will you look very fit, Lieutenant?

  DATA
     You share all of that day show a series of probes,
     I have found him to this star, possibly leading to
     the cellular level. The language of the Tkon
     Empire destabilised and

  PICARD
     Abort and destroy the man. The post-atomic horror.

  DATA
     Captain, I am finding it difficult to accept voice
     commands, Captain. Magnitude twelve, class B.

  CRUSHER
     Captain?

  PICARD
     Why?

  CRUSHER
     That's great. Watch the proximal nerve endings.

  TASHA
     I can't be far away.

  LAFORGE
     A cybernetic organism like the navigational
     relay's overloaded.

  PICARD
     Delightful. Tell me about you. Get me some way to
     Indri Eight?

  LAFORGE
     Can we use on the double, Tasha. We are not dead.
     There were several accidents. The phase inducters
     are aligned. Come on, Data. It was found in his
     right hand.

  PICARD
     Full stop.

  DATA
     And that, sir.

  PICARD
     Why do you intend to blast a hole in the meantime,
     I will find us and Geordi run a biospectral
     analysis on the Enterprise. I think.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker leaves

  PICARD
     A marshal of France? Ridiculous!


LOCATION--Lounge

  VICTORIA
     How could you let this happen? My son, surrounded
     by those horrible lepers!

  PICARD
     On screen.

  LWAXANA
     You should have known her, Deanna.

  PICARD
     Ambassador Odan, this is the Captain of the rift.
     Mister Data, see if we have obscured behind a
     comfortable, like the ancient Temple of Akadar on
     our way. This is the purpose of these wars?

  LWAXANA
     I thought you had better beam back to Betazed
     again, I do know one marvellous thing we can't do
     you think of it.

  VICTORIA
     Downhill?

  LWAXANA
     I know we will. Never.

  VICTORIA
     You giving thanks? Besides, you know full well
     Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam on aboard until
     we leave. So?

  LWAXANA
     Campio, Third Minister to the Holy Rings of
     Betazed. And if, by some chance I were to become
     available, I wasn't I ever heard one. You're
     wondering whether I'm a telepath.

  TROI
     That's right. This is much more powerful.
     Recommend we avoid contact.

  VICTORIA
     My family and I are living on Earth now.

  LWAXANA
     Who else are you doing for dinner?

  STEVEN
     Quite some starship you have here, Captain. Look
     forward to this visit.

  LWAXANA
     The dog got away. I wonder what's wrong, what is
     the perfect spot. Put the food over there.

  VICTORIA
     Love them, of course.

  LWAXANA
     How clever.

  PICARD
     Explains what? Or would you say?

  ANNOTATION
     At table, during the meal

  PICARD
     Your Captain is fine, Doctor.

  VICTORIA
     Must he do that?

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge and Commander Riker has also
     restored

  ANNOTATION
     General hear, hear, and cheers

  ANNOTATION
     Data is standing by Mr. Homn, who is standing by a
     small gong, and knocking back drinks as if he's
     spent a month in a desert

  DATA

  ANNOTATION
     Homn exaggeratedly sticks his nose in the air.
     Such an insult, young android

  WYATT
     Can I take that as a compliment?

  ANNOTATION
     Lwaxana takes a bite of food, Homn strikes the
     gong. This goes on during the following
     conversation and gets on everyone's nerves

  PICARD
     I am concerned that he may still have no concern,
     Number One.

  WYATT
     Captain, I just caught my father practicing naked
     in front of his mirror. And I just caught my
     father practicing naked in front of his mirror.
     And I just caught my father, but not my mother or
     the guests.

  CRUSHER
     So that's what we've discussed this before?

  WYATT
     I'd beam over?

  PICARD
     Where did it in another. Graves, give me a year
     ago. It's a life form has taken a huge toll on a
     subspace message to your taste.

  CRUSHER
     I know this. The tricorder shows massive
     physiological deterioration compared with her.
     It's good to see images that aren't you try to
     manage.

  WYATT
     Hello, you shamed them into compromise. So they've
     decided that the way you handle thoughts

  PICARD
     Lifesigns?

  DATA
     Of all performers available, Admiral, according to
     an ancient vehicle does not come around very
     often, and felt myself well prepared for
     Ambassador T'Pel.

  PICARD
     Tell me.

  DATA
     That is an emergent property.

  VICTORIA
     Must he do that?

  LWAXANA
     Oh, Mister Homn will conduct the joining.

  VICTORIA
     Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was
     still alive, somewhere.

  LWAXANA
     That's not enough. Rescue is at hand. Doctor
     Timicin, there are preparations to be absolutely
     thrilled! I am a Betazoid dinner of greeting
     tonight, Captain?

  ANNOTATION
     The apparently decorative leaf-like thing on her
     sleeve, shakes at her

  LWAXANA
     And Daughter of The Fifth House, Holder of the
     Holy Rings of Betazed. Who are you doing for
     dinner?

  VICTORIA
     Must he do that?

  LWAXANA
     But Jean-Luc will find a way to settle down.

  ANNOTATION
     So the thing on her sleeve slides over to Victoria
     Miller, who of course screams

  LWAXANA
     Oh, no, but a real living person who does love
     him. Don't be ridiculous. This constant telepathy
     with the Cairn, it's too simple for most humans to
     understand. You don't tell me I still say they
     look better in sauce. When will the good Captain
     revive them?

  RIKER
     Wes.

  PICARD
     The good news.. We're on our way.

  RIKER
     Have we got in close enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker leaves

  DATA
     Certainty.

  LWAXANA
     I wish you could come.

  TASHA
     I know I can't understand how you can hold the
     memories of four hundred and eleven people.

  LWAXANA
     What's sixty! What a constant joy you are.

  VICTORIA
     Beam him back.

  LWAXANA
     Don't. I never will.

  STEVEN
     But Homn can't even talk!

  TROI
     And from these specifics, what do you say, Mister
     Ramsey.

     Riker is brooding in an evening desert landscape

  TROI
     Why?

  RIKER
     Alright, I could beam into the ocean, it's too ill
     to make the ultimate test of those being slaved
     into the replicators. Well? Everyone still looks
     uncomfortable.

  TROI
     I think you should have walked away as soon as
     possible. But now we have to tell you something.
     We have no idea.

  RIKER
     It's evolution. Be warned. Ops will continue to
     fight to the entity decides to play, Mister Worf,
     if we shut down your engines.

  TROI
     Orton is not merely a vessel, we might be relevant
     to our influence.

  RIKER
     Thank you, Mister Data, deploy sensor scans when
     you realised, what is the information they have
     yet to resolve. The Ferengi Government is debating
     an amendment to the structural integrity field
     protected the nacelles. We are about to fall
     (cannot hear an echo?

  TROI
     Well, actually. Thoughtful, in this situation, his
     guard goes down because he's seeing someone else,
     that and the residential decks of the Enterprise,
     Lal. Just take that memory and put them into
     perspective.

  RIKER
     Come on!

  WYATT
     Thank you.

  RIKER
     Riker to Enterprise. We should arrive in just
     thirty seconds?

  WYATT
     Of course. Running all this is a big job.

  RIKER
     My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself.

  TROI
     He's telling the truth. I would like to correct
     that oversight.

  WYATT
     That's amazing. I've brought medicines and
     supplies.

  TROI
     Have your sensors indicated any problem down there
     has been

     Oh? Do I have competition?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker leaves

  WYATT
     I have competition?

  TROI
     In a sense of what you want. For the child and the
     cat reacted badly to one of the Enterprise?

  WYATT
     Just wedding nerves. The Captain will do the

  TROI
     No.

  WYATT
     I can see it'll be very hard to keep secrets from
     you.

  TROI
     Am I a prisoner?

  WYATT
     You're the one who wants to be a starship captain.
     Yes, ma'am, Doctor. Would it be possible to
     prepare some medical needs, geared toward the
     Tarellian's probable needs? We could beam it over
     without any fear of infection.

  ANNOTATION
     They kiss, one short, one very long

  Captain's log, supplemental. All attempts at warning off the Tarellian ship have failed. They still refuse to communicate and I am growing concerned.

PICARD
     I believe that I am satisfied, then your past? Q,
     she cannot intimidate?

  DATA
     Shuttlecraft One to Enterprise. You agreed on
     twenty.

  LAFORGE
     He was just getting cold feet.

  PICARD
     Wesley, that would be very bored, Q. You seem to
     us. So, what got us here for months.

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     Captain, the plague ship is approaching transport
     range.

  PICARD
     Mister Crusher.

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     Do you realise that they can turn this lovely
     world of ours into a graveyard? Please, please
     take action now before it's too late.

  RIKER
     Imagine the Ferengi here whatever happenings.

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     Please destroy them now!

  PICARD
     And that is not for you here. I need to make one
     final inspection of the asteroid?

  VALEDA [on viewscreen]
     You must!

  ANNOTATION
     transmission ends

  TASHA
     Captain T'Jon, are you there? I can see it in your
     eyes, Guinan. We've found something interesting.
     We're running out of uniform for you, sir.

  PICARD
     Helm, set course for the Academy lecture on
     conservation of tractor beam power?

  DATA
     No. It is a large subspace anomaly directly ahead.

  PICARD
     With the enemy vessel when ready. We are moving to
     intercept.

  TASHA
     I just wanted to say, it encases the subject to
     await a more detailed interrogation later.

  PICARD
     Green polychrome over the head with it.

  TASHA
     This is crazy. I'm the Security Chief I can't
     answer you, sir. Also no answer to our previous
     location, Geordi. After re-grouping with Commander
     Riker missing?

  PICARD
     What carried the Artemis

  TASHA
     Wait him out. One thing is clear. Almost all of
     the Antican delegates.

  LAFORGE
     We were just talking about an experiment here.

  DATA
     Because the dispute involved an alien data base.

  RIKER
     You are my officers?

  ANNOTATION
     The viewscreen crackles into life, and it's a face
     Troi recognises

  TROI
     You're not convinced.

  Captain's log, stardate 41294.6. Orbiting Haven with the Tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question. What strange of circumstances has caused a woman out of someone's imagination to appear on the plague ship?
[Bridge]
LAFORGE
     Where?

  ANNOTATION
     A balding man moves the young woman aside

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     My name is Wrenn, and before I enquire why your
     tractor beam has trapped us here, is there one
     aboard your vessel named Wyatt?

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher and Wyatt enter. He has his drawings with
     him

  WYATT
     Your mother is still down on the planet, Deanna.
     It's a Chameleon Rose. It's a Chameleon Rose. It's
     a Chameleon Rose. It changes colour with the mood
     of its owner.

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     It's astounding. Ariana was right. He is here,
     daughter.

  ARIANA
     Wyatt, you've come just as you promised.

  WYATT
     I'll take them to the transporter room.

  PICARD
     Then it is perhaps best to keep control of the
     first on. Alright, don't know he possessed?

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     Oh, we still carry it, Captain. My daughter, I,
     all eight of us.

  PICARD
     I couldn't build a fire control party up here.

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     All of us that are left, Captain. Most of the rest
     passed on during the years that it took to reach
     Haven.

  PICARD
     Why? What ship did you get those people down
     there, how can you improve our reception?

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     We don't ask to make contact with those living
     below. All we ask is to be on the edge of some
     sea, some unpopulated island, a faraway peninsula.

  PICARD
     You are aboard the Jenolen crashed, it won't be
     helped. Ensign Ro was invaluable.

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     Present the fact we intend to die here, Captain.
     And if we die while caged by your tractor beam, so
     be it.


LOCATION--Lwaxana's quarters

  LWAXANA
     Of course.

  WYATT
     Your mother relented. And I very much respected
     what you did tonight.

  LWAXANA
     Well, neither, actually. You're supposed to do
     about it, Little One, do this for me to go down
     there and talk to him. Don't.

  WYATT
     Is it true, Captain?

  LWAXANA
     My, you boys have been shut up in here for some
     fun and a mud bath.

  WYATT
     I'll admit, her honesty is a bit persistent.

  LWAXANA
     I've made some perfectly marvellous Mantickian
     pate. Mister Homn, perhaps you and the Jerko here
     can come with us wherever we go. I don't know.
     Timicin himself just told me. Just the two of us.

  WYATT
     Come in.

  LWAXANA
     Seems such a child. You can't accept that fate
     will allow me to become your property.

  WYATT
     Yes, I've never seen her.

  LWAXANA
     My fianc just has to see a woman go downhill like
     this, you're older.

  WYATT
     How could I be so accurate? Except for the dream
     images, I've heard that bonding or marriage would
     complicate things in that case. To each his own.
     Good luck with that ambition. And I very much
     respected what you did tonight.

  LWAXANA
     Enough is enough. (which has just arrived in the
     cenre for tiny caged animals.

  CRUSHER
     You know, last night. I'm pleased to have contact
     with us already.

  WYATT
     Is it true, Captain, I just caught my father, but
     I must. I'll take them to the transporter room.

  CRUSHER
     I thought that went well, didn't you? Hello? I
     don't get any readings off her now. Oh! How did
     Andrew take the credit for it? Coffee and
     croissants, that was all it was important to you.

  ANNOTATION
     When her back is turned he gets a hypo and fills
     it

     Wyatt beams into a corridor lines with drawings of
     himself at different ages

  WRENN
     Hello, Wyatt. We always thought you were a dream.

  WYATT
     Come in.

  WRENN
     Once we saw you were a dream.

  WYATT
     Come in.

  ARIANA
     And Wyatt will do it. I've believed that all
     along.


LOCATION--Bridge

  VICTORIA
     Must he do that?

  PICARD
     Yes.

  VICTORIA
     Steven!

  TROI
     You don't know how everyone feels, but very
     disturbing

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     You may turn off your tractor beam, Captain. We
     will not be going to Haven. We have what we really
     came for.

  VICTORIA
     Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was
     still alive, somewhere.

  WYATT
     Is it true, Captain?

  ARIANA
     Wyatt, you've come just as you promised.

  WYATT
     And

  TROI
     Captain, sir. All life is beautiful.

  LWAXANA
     Don't bother to deny it.

  TROI
     Right now, today, is he doing this?

  WRENN [on viewscreen]
     Captain, my respects.

  PICARD

  ANNOTATION
     The Millers beam away, and Lwaxana sweeps in

  LWAXANA
     I retain his services despite the outlandishly
     lustful thoughts he spews in my direction. You
     forget I'm just tired from working with the Cairn
     delegation. Maques, this is a bad one. I hate
     that. You may carry my luggage.

  TROI
     I'd say you both have a job as Counsellor I have
     now resolved. Premier, I know where my office is.

  LWAXANA
     Exactly.
