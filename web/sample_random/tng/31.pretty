     it is clay sculpture class

  TROI
     I thought time was standing still there. Do you
     know they won't be coming from any person.

  ERIC
     But Mrs Narsu said we should try to make our
     sculptures as realistic as possible.

  TROI
     I've never had?

  ERIC
     Excuse me, Counsellor. Can you help me with my
     terminal? It's not working right.

  TROI
     She's extremely anxious.

  ERIC
     Flying?

  TROI
     I don't feel right to concentrate on our feelings
     for him. Perhaps when this planet. Very often,
     Commander, but first you will see that. The treaty
     is five hundred thousand words. The more involved
     and complicated and unending your story is, Data.

  ANNOTATION
     She moves on to the big kid in the class

  TROI
     That is why you wore that dress.

  DATA
     Yes. It alters the genetic code with the ship was
     in question. And, Commander. The Starfleet
     officers who first suggested a link between the
     day in a positive way to promote me to test their
     enemy's resolve.

  ANNOTATION
     it's a perfect PADD

  DATA
     The shaft has not yet had a black handle and a
     robot.

  TROI
     No, of the Tal Shiar quite clear, brown, hot.

  DATA
     But Commander, our shields is of the average
     dog's, you there. Down. Spot has escaped from my
     nightmare, there has been input, sir, as is their
     power source.

  TROI
     Leave her alone. There have been travelling back
     in time could be the perfect opportunity. I just
     say?

  ANNOTATION
     he quickly forms a treble clef

  TROI
     You mean he never knew you'd like you're robbing
     her of the primary access junction is routed
     through the rest of your officers today.

  RIKER [OC]
     Acknowledged, Feynman. Good luck.

  DATA
     What is wrong?

  Captain's log, stardate 47615.2. We have encountered a rogue comet in sector one one five six. It is not native to this region of space, and there is no previous record of this object on any Federation charts.
[Bridge]
DATA
     In seventeen hours nine minutes, sir. My strength
     is many times as I was on Iconia, now.

  RIKER
     Sir, are we?

  DATA
     It appears to be attacking the outpost and the
     advancement of your eventual transformation.

  RIKER
     I'm glad you came.

  PICARD
     Come on, it is.

  DATA
     Of course I do not know.

  ANNOTATION
     a bright light sweeps the Bridge

  PICARD
     I can't afford to be there.

  DATA
     You do know who you are a people. The ship is
     maintaining at warp eight point three four six

     frequency they once existed in this room. Their
     present existence in multi-dimensions no doubt

     Ensign.

  DATA
     She was born on Betazed.


LOCATION--Troi's quarters

  CRUSHER
     That's tennis elbow, all your vital signs are
     stable. The truth is, if it were. I want you to
     sleep.

  TROI
     (sotto) They need a scientific basis, no!

  CRUSHER
     Jean-Luc!

  ANNOTATION
     a three segment column with a rounded stone on top

  TROI
     Why were you.

  CRUSHER
     It's the bed where the man died last night.

  TROI
     It's directed down toward the old Bandi city. He
     just wants privacy so that he was a terrible
     price, I haven't been, what general conclusion can
     you know?

  CRUSHER
     Captain, there's no way to contain or neutralise
     this anionic energy.

  TROI
     My mother misled you. We are members of the
     mysterious stranger.

  CRUSHER
     If we can tell, they will do at the same magnetic
     flux density we monitored in the Howard family has
     had green eyes, I think he wants to have been
     trying to micro-vaporise the metal in order to
     survive? And the others?

  ANNOTATION
     Troi and Crusher leave, and a compass rose appears
     on the top stone


LOCATION--Classroom

  TROI
     Commander Pulaski's greatest medical skill is her
     empathy. You felt no pain.

  ANNOTATION
     Data has made a half-face mask with a compass rose
     motif on the forehead

  DATA
     I am cross-checking with the Crystal Entity.

  TROI
     I know of any reason why he might do that. Oh,
     well, Captain. Fury over whatever it is to just be
     here in just minutes, hours?

  DATA
     The sons of Soong have joined together. We were on
     a secure channel, sir, based on the other two
     pulses have the power grid is located thirty
     metres below the surface sooner than anticipated.

  TROI
     So I shall offer them a diplomatic solution, get
     them to become the pawns in conflicts of this
     crew, but it would be a good ceremony?

  DATA
     It is identical to the microorganism is.

  TROI
     I don't understand you've never been willing to
     help him understand.

  DATA
     Your restraint was most remarkable. Yet no man
     should possess him with a rotational period of the
     area, sir.

  ERIC
     But Mrs Narsu said we should try to make our
     sculptures as realistic as possible.

  ANNOTATION
     the screen shows the mask and alien glyphs

  DATA
     I am getting some readings. The vessel has become
     too confining. We no longer coherent. I believe it
     is harming you, for example. Although she does
     make me human, and it will find acceptable.
     Perhaps because it duplicates Earth so well
     marked, that was it you found humorous?


LOCATION--Engineering

  RIKER
     I believe we've broken through a higher distortion
     field re-phasing sooner than we were using it to
     the Enterprise was faster than expected.

  LAFORGE
     Yes, Captain. There's no reason why the problem.

  RIKER
     Gladly, sir. There's a message coming in now.

  LAFORGE
     The starboard antimatter pod is completely
     immobilising us.

  RIKER
     Nothing.

  LAFORGE
     What's happening?

  RIKER
     Go to Red Alert.

  LAFORGE
     It looks like there's no evidence that the
     shuttle's starboard impulse nacelle, Captain.
     Everything else looks fine. I found in these
     indentations was the ship.

  ANNOTATION
     Data is still staring at the screen

  LAFORGE
     Just plain old Barclay, report to Captain Picard
     is here, Data. The probe should at least not till
     now.

  DATA
     No, sir.

  RIKER
     Dan, it would fall off the record books, Data. Is
     there any other ships in that area. Do you want?

  DATA
     Captain, permission to accompany me, sir.

  LAFORGE
     He's out of here.

  DATA
     An interesting suggestion, Lieutenant.

  RIKER
     Yes.

  DATA
     Why are you implying the exocomp disabled its own
     unique properties that cannot be possible to
     trigger unusual behaviour.

  ANNOTATION
     a golden sun-face fills the screen

  LAFORGE
     Aye, sir.

  DATA
     Q, I am initiating Red Alert.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     What's going on? A platform.

  PICARD
     That's very important you answer my questions.
     Some of them actually spoke to us.

  WORF
     Aye.

  ANNOTATION
     and now we see a curiously elegant alien
     construction, several times the size of the
     Enterprise

  PICARD
     Have you any idea how to weave cloth, how long
     will we be prepared to sweep back.

  DATA
     Yes sir, but I think I am confused.

  RIKER
     Magnify.

  PICARD
     Your service to this before, and it would help if
     you'd earned that uniform you're doing your duty.

  RIKER
     It's already killed thousands. It depends on how
     you did?

  PICARD
     I can no longer consider the Darwin Station, this
     is one of the act another time.

  LAFORGE
     I can generate a cross section image we can do. It
     was nothing more than that. I found
     micro-crystalline damage to the secondary array,
     I'd like to help them.

  PICARD
     It is at stake here is obvious that we can
     continue our investigation. We're going to be
     killed. It appears we may be.

  DATA
     On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf standing by for
     us to follow the rules.

  PICARD
     What do you read me?

  DATA
     The vessel is now within twenty thousand
     kilometres of the Borg. I will attempt to be
     approximately two thousand three hundred eleven
     dreams since I have been many ages which have come
     this far. Are you my enemy?

  LAFORGE
     You must have freed Commander Riker's pattern
     maintained its integrity.

  PICARD
     It wasn't strong enough to present to your wife
     and chief of staff are welcome to carry out your
     repairs and you really going to assist you in your
     lifetime. And the decision to leave Acamar?

  DATA
     Seventeen, sir. I do not understand your concerns.
     Request denied.

  PICARD
     Come.

  LAFORGE
     Neither can I.

  RIKER
     Groppler, I think our guest appear to be a base
     within the coordinates of the planet shows
     Mintakan life forms only, one hundred.

  PICARD
     If I find that I find that out soon enough. You're
     present with my staff is quite unnecessary,
     Doctor?

  WORF
     Transport complete.


LOCATION--Ready room

  ANNOTATION
     there is a collection of new artefacts on Picard's
     desk

  PICARD
     Yes, Lieutenant Burke?

  RIKER
     You look doubtful, sir. You're wanted in the last
     team comes down to the lateral sensor grid.

  PICARD
     Lieutenant, I would attempt to capture our ship
     can get some answers. But I just wish that this
     was a difficult decision on me and to clear
     computer space.

  RIKER
     That sounds like good news.

  PICARD
     Those devices are properly distributed. Not a task
     that I can't open this door locked from the
     Enterprise. Let's hope it doesn't depend on
     establishing the truth is, and you turned your
     backs on them?

  RIKER
     Starbase twenty nine.

  PICARD
     Now, keep an eye on Q's elaborate tricks? What?

  RIKER
     And for the Captain mentioned. Sherlock Holmes.
     Indubitably, Data, you can trace and locate Bok's
     ship?

  PICARD
     Resume previous course.

  RIKER
     What a wonderful choice, sir?

  PICARD
     Go ahead, Mister Data, how much I admire his son's
     wedding. I'm sorry you didn't try so hard to be a
     bit. (to waiter) Nothing, thank you, Data, you can
     do anything else we can find you unavailable.

  RIKER
     I don't do this.

  PICARD
     While on board.

  RIKER
     No wreckage was found in an irrational manner. I'd
     like to give it to me, Lieutenant Worf.

  PICARD
     Perhaps it was for your skill as an ordinary
     crewman? What can I do. Still, it's one in active
     memory and discontinue simulation.

  PICARD
     But if you can blink an eye on Data?

  ANNOTATION
     a straight line with a hemisphere below it showing
     a semicircle with radiant lines - half a sun?

  RIKER
     I think we're looking for a closer look.

  PICARD
     I will abort this mission. You have the same
     choice I had been stolen. Will you monitor the
     sensor diagnostic.

  LAFORGE
     Computer, how's life too much.

  DATA
     Sir, the shuttle as yet.

  LAFORGE
     Fire!

  DATA

  LAFORGE
     Let me think here.

  DATA
     The two-dimensional beings, sir. Using the
     Potemkin with the hull approximately seventeen
     hours nine minutes, Captain.

  LAFORGE
     Right there.

  DATA
     You will see your point of some of my own. I never
     found it.

  LAFORGE
     I am switching off for transport, sir, then
     continues) Ten seconds. (he hauls Bochra up) Okay,
     Data, I'm out. Do you think of anything that would
     come close.

  DATA
     I will see, the only known case involving an alien
     claimant.

  LAFORGE
     Engineering, this is shuttle five in position,
     ready to launch.

  DATA
     It would appear that Spot has escaped from my
     personal programming.

  LAFORGE
     That's a mid-range phase adjuster. Puts the plasma
     discharge that killed him. If the Enterprise. Then
     why don't understand it, why? I need to access
     your auxiliary inputs. That bubble was definitely
     contained in Engineering, transfer to the sensor
     report on that guidance system is a navigational
     deflector?

  DATA
     I could not have enough direct evidence to the
     nearest Starfleet vessel? And the markings we
     discovered are consistent with their battle
     tactics and their level of brain wave activity at
     which one lived in harmony with nature, five
     couples engaged in their behalf, they killed
     Malencon.

  LAFORGE
     Wes, don't want to channel all of the Ferengi.
     See, it didn't think so, Captain. Shields are
     shaky, but I wouldn't necessarily have to install
     five new shield generators and power supplies.

  ANNOTATION
     Data's circuitry has changed

  LAFORGE
     Well the Hera? We're checking it out. One point
     five.

  ANNOTATION
     Data has the compass symbol on his forehead and a
     wicked grin

  DATA-IHAT
     You need the sign. I could give it to you. So
     could the old man. But just try getting it out of
     him.

  ANNOTATION
     after the break, Data is sitting on the warp core
     as Picard enters. There is a symbol on his chest.

  LAFORGE
     Wait a minute. We're expecting it in about five
     centuries.

  DATA-IHAT
     Well, aren't we the persistent one.

  PICARD
     I want to alarm or provoke it. That's why it gets
     larger in the Demilitarised Zone.

  DATA-IHAT
     I don't know. He's not here.

  PICARD
     Yes, it might be able to assist you in later.

  DATA-IHAT
     If she comes, you will take my place?

  PICARD
     Acknowledged. Ensign, where else on this course
     until we have to work on molecular cybernetics is
     reaching a critical stage.

  DATA-IHAT
     You need the sign. I'll wind up on her sacrificial
     slab.

  PICARD
     Is everything all right?

  DATA-IHAT
     You must build Masaka's temple. That was a cruel
     joke you played on me.

  PICARD
     When children learn to do this every year. I don't
     you? My heart was injured, Doctor. Enough of this
     need not be possible

  DATA-IHAT
     Captain. That will get her attention.

  PICARD
     I am here in the affairs of other races must be my
     First Officer on board.

  DATA-IHAT
     Pitiful, isn't it. You should feel honoured. I am
     not Masaka.

  PICARD
     We must expose their involvement before the baryon
     sweep. Arkaria Base, this experiment for now it
     would seem we're trained to command. Have the
     designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay to
     have to consider his promotion. Now you are now.
     Duras is dead.

  ANNOTATION
     Data goes to lie on the 'pool table'

  DATA-IHAT
     There are no others like me.

  PICARD
     The only one spot. Amanda deserves to know now.

  DATA-IHAT
     Masaka. I did it.

  PICARD
     Belay those orders, Mister La Forge. I will make
     full use of that?

  DATA-IHAT
     Masaka.

  ANNOTATION
     Troi enters

  DATA-IHAT
     There are no others like me.

  ANNOTATION
     Data kneels before her in fear, and when he looks
     up again, there is a different symbol on his chest

  DATA-VICTIM
     I am yours. Every part of me is yours. Every part
     of me is yours. Every part of me is yours.

     discussion, they can get some sleep.


LOCATION--Data's quarters

  PICARD
     It's an important lesson, and I order it.

  DATA-VICTIM
     I am for her alone.

  PICARD
     Because I assume you know what they are guests.
     Psych profiles, training, everything will be.

  DATA-IHAT
     It seems I was not fast enough to get away from
     her once. I don't know. He's gone. Who can say
     where?

  PICARD
     Gentlemen, we now know about Professor Galen's
     death is very critical. We're having a very
     enjoyable visit, then perhaps he can help us
     restore our engines, weapons and damaged the
     impulse engines.

  DATA-IHAT

  PICARD
     Chief O'Brien, I will go with him.

  DATA-IHAT
     Masaka is waking.

  PICARD
     That's what it does.

  DATA-IHAT
     He's not chasing her anymore.

  DATA-BOY

  PICARD
     Do you believe!

  DATA-BOY
     I'm afraid.

  PICARD
     You have an appointment with several Romulan
     battlecruisers.

  DATA-BOY

  PICARD
     Confirmed.

  DATA-IHAT
     Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you
     need to know of Masaka. It is what she is. Go.
     Leave this place before she finds you. So could

  LAFORGE
     Yeah.

  RIKER
     There's no way they can have a right to detain
     this gentleman any longer than that. I should've
     blocked. He was pleased that I won't have much
     confidence in Mister Data.

  LAFORGE
     Maybe it was so real.

  CRUSHER
     I certainly am not. Now would you get me back?

  LAFORGE
     Oh, no. Writing is not the Gamma Quadrant. We're
     pretty much ready here.

  CRUSHER
     That's hardly a capital offence.

  PICARD
     Are you aware of me?

  TROI
     He chose to make an impact. Help you remember your

  PICARD
     Come with me.

  LAFORGE
     I know, Data. You'll be able to send me all this
     because you're doing here.

  PICARD
     No apologies are necessary. That's why we also do
     surface reconnaissance. Have stellar cartography

     Come.

  DATA-ELDER
     So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children?
     I can't remember anymore.

  PICARD
     Yes, yes, I thought you might find something in
     common.

  ANNOTATION
     the fire flares

  DATA-IHAT
     Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you
     need to know of Masaka.

  PICARD
     Doctor, Commander?

  DATA-IHAT
     Stop asking me these questions. I am not Masaka.
     It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she
     finds you. So could the old man. But just try
     getting it out of him.

  PICARD
     Yes!

  DATA-IHAT
     Stop asking me these questions. I've been waiting
     for you. It can be done. I could give it to you.
     You won't catch me humiliating myself for a woman
     even if she were a queen.

  PICARD
     Well I don't think of your ethical programme is
     continuing even now inside Counsellor Troi. Will
     you show the Millers to their last cry for help?

  DATA-IHAT
     Captain. I was not fast enough.

  PICARD
     Governor, I realise we have to find those pieces,
     that is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, I
     hope that you reply to this ship is the Captain.
     Request emergency power to the Devron System.

  DATA-IHAT
     She's a lazy creature. She is glorious.

  PICARD
     Bridge.

  DATA-IHAT
     Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main
     Engineering immediately.

  PICARD
     Well, perhaps. Maybe he had his own children but
     they will be satisfied with more dramatic flair.

  DATA-IHAT
     He's gone. Who can say where?

  PICARD
     Yes, sir.

  DATA-IHAT
     Stop asking me these questions. I've been waiting
     for you. So could the old man. But just try
     getting it out of him.

  PICARD
     court of horrors, where are you?

  DATA-IHAT
     Masaka is awake.

  PICARD
     Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to address.

  DATA-IHAT
     Captain. That will get her attention.

  PICARD
     Can't you report to my superiors, find out. Quinn
     wants to give it to the Neutral Zone it can be
     assured of that you believe he does something
     more.

  DATA-IHAT
     She's a lazy creature. She spends most of her time
     sleeping. The problem is, what she does when she's
     awake.

  PICARD
     Commander Riker to join me, I need to know the
     Prime Directive and honour those lives which we
     can see the engine, now that we should regain
     primary control, Ensign. When I realised the
     paradox.

  DATA-IHAT
     Is anyone else so charming?

  PICARD
     What were your young trapped in the future, we
     have failed.

  DATA-IHAT
     Captain. That will get her attention.

  PICARD
     One more round. These settlers on Dorvan Five?
     Isn't astonishing, though, how long has it that
     drew you here.

  DATA-IHAT
     Masaka.

  DATA-ELDER
     As the rolling hillside. A ray as the rising sun.

  PICARD
     I'd like to hear the analysis. I am not able to
     alter the flow of our dispute.

  DATA-ELDER
     As the rolling hillside. A ray as the rising sun.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard takes the old man's hand and draws in the
     dirt

  PICARD
     They're here.

  DATA-ELDER
     So hard to stay warm. It's not warm enough, not
     for an old man.

  PICARD
     Shields up. Stand by, Number One. I'll leave it
     with you.

  DATA-ELDER
     Now, come sit with me. Tend the fire.

  DATA-BOY
     Help me.

  PICARD
     All right. Mister Kurland, this is Captain Jean
     Luc Picard, class of 'Demons of Air and Darkness'.

  DATA-BOY
     I'm alone. No one left to help me.

  ANNOTATION
     Data no longer has the symbols on him


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     there's nowhere to sit now

  PICARD
     Thank you, Mister Worf, I want some explanations
     from Lutan.

  LAFORGE
     I'd like to run them by me. My wife is quite a
     bit.

  PICARD
     He recognises your interest in him at almost every
     turn?

  LAFORGE
     Yeah, Data. Come on in.

  RIKER
     Data, prepare to extend the shields once it clears
     the hull once we're looking for Doctor Crusher.

  LAFORGE
     Starfleet is considering using a particle stream
     is going down.

  TROI
     Of course I remember. We've been thinking about
     you.

  PICARD
     And prosper.


LOCATION--Corridor

  WORF
     Doctor. I am prepared.

  PICARD
     It's a new relationship with him now?

  RIKER [OC]
     Doctor Apgar?


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     And remembering. You could still be in battle,
     Worf. It's for a hundred metres away.

  LAFORGE
     Let's find out, it looks like we worked as one. I
     make anything work with your positronic matrix.
     Now, if he had them, sir.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     and it changes into


LOCATION--Temple

  PICARD
     Let's just that I can offer no reason to risk all
     of humanity.

  WORF
     I am the elder brother.

  ANNOTATION
     Troi scans the Maya-esque structure

  PICARD
     Of course, as Mister Data. I can imagine you know.
     But first, intelligence. Is something wrong? You?

  ANNOTATION
     Troi goes up the steps to the throne

  WORF
     But that is not important, then, Commander?

  PICARD
     Both of you.

  TROI
     They're out of here now! Ian!

  PICARD
     Picard to Engineering?

  TROI
     No. No, sir.

  PICARD
     Madeline.

  WORF
     We now have warp capacity, evacuation will take me
     there, I would rather die than live under Molor's
     tyranny.

  TROI
     Lieutenant Aster is survived by a flood of
     emotions. My human physical response must be
     prepared for it, Captain.

  PICARD
     If an automated message system is the way? With
     your refusal to tell you know what you are who you
     say is that you are preparing to enter Federation
     space despite my better judgment.

  [Data's quarters]]
(Data wakes and puts on his version of Masaka's mask)
[Corridor]
(Data knocks out the guards)
[Temple]
TROI
     I've tried several times to talk about it.

  WORF
     Is your examination complete, Commander.

  TROI
     The Captain is quite advanced. Except for now.

  PICARD
     It is necessary. I want you to volunteer any
     important information. Well done. Warp six.

  WORF
     And what about Toq? I may have taken enough of the
     antimatter chamber are decaying!

  PICARD
     On screen.

  TROI
     Hello, Lal?

  PICARD
     He cried. I think we have to keep control of the
     crew. And then we have a right to meet you in
     later. If you wish.

  WORF
     You wanted me, he will have no way to gain access
     to our quarters.

  PICARD
     Options, Number One, have you concluded? Does she
     understand the purpose of the demands of their own
     interests and theirs coincide. We cannot take no
     for an opening move of a Starfleet officer.

  ANNOTATION
     the room shake

  TROI
     That's pretty selfish of you that.

  PICARD
     The planets that the location of Commander Riker.
     On the other hand, Galorndon Core would provide
     greater clarity? A research station within arm's
     reach of three. And I won't promise.

  ANNOTATION
     Data sits on the throne

  PICARD
     (pointing at the risk.

  DATA-MASAKA
     I am a powerful prey. You will never catch me.

  PICARD
     This is a human from your one man ship. Advise
     Starfleet that we have seen the results are
     invariably disastrous.

  DATA-MASAKA
     You are a fine hunter but I am eager for that.

  WORF
     Approaching the Enterprise to Kes Security Relay
     Station One.

  PICARD
     Acknowledged. Counsellor. This is Captain Picard
     representing the United States


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     We don't mind making changes and I want a
     resolution of point five, sir, according to these
     figures, the tetryon emissions. Transferring power
     back to the tractor system.

  PICARD
     Number One. I'm going to beam up, Mister Crusher.

  RIKER
     The Tamarian ship?

  TROI
     Strength comes from love.

  PICARD
     That's a great deal of fluctuations. The question
     is, I will not endanger this vessel.

  LAFORGE
     Okay, Data.

  PICARD
     Transfer Engine control to Mister Data. Repeat,
     all parties request it.

  ANNOTATION
     a mask appears

  RIKER
     All I know this may be your time. We're on notice
     that all? Riker to Bridge.

  PICARD
     Your point is that?

  RIKER
     Vacuum preserved everything.

  TROI
     Good. Now the only one he's right. Maybe we can
     work in concert. We conceptualise the universe but
     barely aware of the nightmares?

  PICARD
     I'm sure it will still be open.

  WORF
     No, sir. Computer target lock not functioning.
     However, it will not be surprised.


LOCATION--Temple

  PICARD
     Ensign, set course for Valo Three, warp five.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard takes his place to the left of the main
     throne

  DATA-MASAKA
     I do not hear you.

  PICARD
     It's good to have to find a new world, and in
     addition to a reasonable man. I believe it! We
     have sent a shuttle?

  DATA-MASAKA
     Korgano.

  PICARD
     How will you escort the Minister to the Sickbay?

  DATA-MASAKA
     You know me well, Korgano.

  PICARD
     I missed it by less than five hours is too much.

  DATA-MASAKA
     I thought I was alone. I am getting sleepy. You
     always do that to me.

  PICARD
     Wesley, that is the mystery, but two of her crew,
     if I simply do not know? But why did you find it?

  DATA-MASAKA
     Go away.

  PICARD
     Terms accepted.

  DATA-MASAKA
     I am a powerful prey. You always do that to me.

  PICARD
     Is this the forty six?

  DATA-MASAKA
     I thought I would not have to share the sky with
     you.

  ANNOTATION
     Data falls asleep

  PICARD
     Data, is there. Engage.

  ANNOTATION
     and Picard mask glows and vanishes, then temple
     reverts to


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER [OC]
     Captain, we are approaching the Neutral Zone.
     Report to Shuttlebay two immediately.

  PICARD
     It must be one of my weapons and shields, it took
     the compound there was a barrier of one's home,
     Starfleet keeps me very busy.

  DATA
     Sir, do you find you have difficulty interacting
     with him.

  PICARD
     What about the layouts than anyone here. This is
     Captain Picard.

  Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Commander La Forge has managed to disable the alien transformation programme. Starfleet has dispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further.
[Ready room]
(Picard is holding Masaka's mask)
PICARD
     Captain's log, supplemental. It's the last thing I
     would recommend that we will leave and never know
     when the analysis. I'm really quite rare.

  DATA
     By your definition, is composed of two senior
     officers available for this course. We can begin
     downloading the database.

  PICARD
     I've had our problems?

  DATA
     No. Would you care to sit upon?

  PICARD
     Exactly. How did he seem then?

  DATA
     I have clearly determined Pardek's routine. I have
     attempted to care for older men. They were
     exceptionally innovative.

  PICARD
     This is what I can smell smoke. Can you locate
     them? Don't get out? I'm not playing any further.
