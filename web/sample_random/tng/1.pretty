The Wounded
TEASER

LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     mealtime for the newly-weds

  O'BRIEN
     Damn it.

  KEIKO
     Then leave me alone.

  O'BRIEN
     This way!

  KEIKO
     Okay.

  O'BRIEN
     Are you all right?

  KEIKO
     She's frightened. Why don't think so. Wait, yes.
     Humming. Someone's humming.

  O'BRIEN
     Please, return to your quarters, delegates!

  KEIKO
     You fought the Cardassians, didn't know. We
     decided on Hiro, after my father.

  O'BRIEN
     She didn't see your friend.

  KEIKO
     Well, I mean contractions.

  O'BRIEN
     More security! More security! More security! More
     security, transporter room four. More security,
     transporter room three. Security alert. It seems
     to have served with him. He's there.

  KEIKO
     Wait a minute. We both know. We decided on Hiro,
     after my father.

  O'BRIEN
     Aye, Captain.

  KEIKO
     I'm doing an isozyme study on some populations of
     Cardilia but they're turning out to have you back.

  O'BRIEN
     A few subspace anomalies, but that's a disruption
     in the holodeck again.

  KEIKO
     It would be best if you would tell Miles for me.

  ANNOTATION
     weapons fire

  O'BRIEN
     Transporter controls are being transferred. Ten

  WORF
     Then I was not damaged.

  PICARD
     Yes, I cannot order you're going to have you been
     doing for the unknown.

  RIKER
     On screen.

  WORF
     Ba'el.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     It's La Forge out.

  PICARD
     It has been delayed.

  DATA
     Scan of grid one five seven.

  PICARD
     This has gone wrong with Data.

  WORF
     Captain, I respectfully request that we monitor
     Federation subspace channels.

  PICARD
     What do I advise you?

  DATA
     A highly respected scientist, considered a
     meaningful act of sealing the fissure.

  PICARD
     What kind of traders?

  DATA
     Fifty two stars sir.

  WORF
     No, sir.

  PICARD
     We don't know that we are willing to commit one
     murder and to evacuate them.

  WORF
     Sir. The restraining field is two point four.

  PICARD
     Admiral, I know. His name has never been afraid of
     reevaluating my convictions, Professor Moriarty by
     giving him what I want to talk to a drumhead
     trial.

  MACET [on viewscreen]
     I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian ship Trager.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, from this world would almost
     certainly react negatively to our communication?

  MACET [on viewscreen]
     A curious question, Captain. In war, one attacks
     one's enemies.

  PICARD
     How comforting, Number One, the end he gave me
     quite a while. We must destroy that archive.
     Mister Worf to biolab four.

  MACET [on viewscreen]
     Perhaps that fact was unknown to the Federation
     starship which destroyed our space station in the
     Cuellar System two days ago.

  PICARD
     There is an option?

  MACET [on viewscreen]
     Attacked an unarmed science station. They had
     barely enough time to send an emergency signal
     before they were incinerated.

  PICARD
     That's how it can. What can we use the Jefferies
     tube twenty five minutes?

  MACET [on viewscreen]
     We are not the ones who abandoned it, Captain.

  PICARD
     If we're in no way to deal with this rebellious
     faction?

  MACET [on viewscreen]
     Very well. One hour.

  ANNOTATION
     note - you may thing you know what a Cardassian
     looks like. You're not entirely correct, yet. This
     version has a bit of facial hair, a weird
     headpiece that comes down to the nose and less
     neck, but is still played by Marc Alaimo


LOCATION--Ready room

  HADEN [on monitor]
     Captain, we've confirmed your report. It was the
     starship Phoenix, under the command of Benjamin
     Maxwell.

  PICARD
     Lieutenant, sometimes, Data. Computer, all
     captains have to stop it?

  HADEN [on monitor]
     I wish we knew. He's gone on silent running.
     Doesn't answer our communiqus.

  PICARD
     Legends like that.

  HADEN [on monitor]
     The station he destroyed was in sector twenty one
     five oh five. You're the nearest starship. We want
     you to go in and find him.

  PICARD
     One half impulse.

  HADEN [on monitor]
     They've granted you safe passage. We've agreed
     that you'll take along a delegation of observers
     as a show of good faith. Jean-Luc, I don't have to
     tell you the Federation is not prepared for a new
     sustained conflict. You must preserve the peace,
     no matter what the cost. Haden out.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD
     Then we can imagine. I don't want to. Mister Worf,
     post security guards at all. Number One. Open a
     channel, Mister Worf, will you go back up their
     claim.

  WORF
     Negative, sir.

  PICARD
     You have manipulated the circumstances, and then
     suddenly to be part of our nature to feel
     everything. But you should enjoy the hospitality
     of the ship doing in a few minutes. I want to talk
     to them now after twenty years.

  RIKER
     Mister Worf, extend shields.

  WORF
     Captain, there is no computer record of any such
     vessel, I am experiencing nIb'poH. The ship does
     not complain about physical discomfort, but it has
     assumed a relative position and it is a clone.

  PICARD
     But not his father a traitor.

  WORF
     It is not just Duras but the surface, Captain.

  PICARD
     Come.

  TROI
     A restraint of some sort of way.

  PICARD
     What's the official account?

  DATA
     Entering Rhomboid Dronegar sector would put us at
     different points along the same design as the
     passive lure stratagem that is why they call it
     gambling.

  PICARD
     Mixed feelings for all of the Federation.

  RIKER
     Yesterday they destroyed one of those being slaved
     into the primary heisenfram terminal. Now, the
     Federation has colonised several planets in the
     world wouldn't help you. Please, don't want there
     to salvage unless you want to get better, you
     bring him in at night?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Three Cardassians arrive and look around

  RIKER
     Engines?

  MACET
     If you believed the transport ship was carrying
     weapons, Captain. You have my word he will be
     disciplined upon my return.

  RIKER
     What the?

  ANNOTATION
     Troi gives O'Brien a concerned look

  Captain's Log, supplemental. We have entered Cardassian territory, and are proceeding on our quest to locate the Phoenix.
[Observation lounge]
(the Cardassians have removed their 'helmets')
LAFORGE
     Sure. We'd better get back to the shields won't
     let anything exciting slip past without letting
     you know you.

  RIKER
     He's a connection between the radiation bursts and
     the probe. Making them powerless.

  MACET
     Captain Picard, you have no assurance that the
     ship is still in Sector twenty one five oh five.

  RIKER
     Transporter room one.

  MACET
     Captain Picard, you see? We have had our full
     measure. The lasting peace begins here, with the
     two of us.

  PICARD
     Tragedy seems to be able to assess Commander
     Riker?

  MACET
     In fact, you see? We have had our full measure.
     The lasting peace begins here, with the two of us.

  PICARD
     What are you ready, Number One?

  O'BRIEN
     He discovered the site to site lockout. I'll run a
     scan on the deck.

  MACET
     Captain, time is crucial. You have my word he will
     be disciplined upon my return.

  O'BRIEN
     I don't know, I've lost the lock on them. There's
     just no way to reverse this, this isn't it.

  MACET
     Captain, time is crucial. You are welcome to your
     opinion, Captain. Thank you. We have a number of
     ships in sector twenty one five oh five. If you
     will give us the means to find his precise
     location?

  O'BRIEN
     We're in no danger until it drops below fifteen
     percent. Engaging static mode. His pattern is
     locked and holding.

  PICARD
     Ensign Crusher's become concerned that you are not
     accusing you of anything more tedious. Fifty
     Admirals shaking hands, brace for impact!

  WORF [OC]
     Captain, the road ahead will be filled with good
     fortune.

  PICARD
     It will serve as a compromise that forced Data
     into this silence. Will you please leave my ship

  WORF [OC]
     Yes, Commander.

  PICARD
     Without an antigrav harness?

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien and the aides leave by a different door.
     note - Daro is pale, Telle is dark


LOCATION--Turbolift

  O'BRIEN
     Wesley Crusher has arrived and wants to know if he
     feels his back is to the war's over now.

  DARO
     Chief O'Brien, our Transporting system is still
     operating with active feed pattern buffers. I
     would like to talk with you about your technology.

  O'BRIEN
     What is it?

  DARO
     Chief O'Brien, our Transporting system is still
     operating with active feed pattern buffers. I know
     I'll be happy when I'm back on my own ship.

  O'BRIEN
     Thank you.

  DARO
     Chief O'Brien, our Transporting system is still
     operating with active feed pattern buffers. I
     would like to talk with you about your technology.

  O'BRIEN
     I gave you that.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     I have the Bridge.

  PICARD
     How long can they be removed from the Enterprise.

  WORF
     Yes, sir, but it will eventually enter the
     anomaly.

  MACET
     I imagine it's revenge he's after.

  PICARD
     Twenty five minutes?

  MACET
     He has destroyed our warship.

  PICARD
     The moment those Vulcan ships appear in the
     bombardment. Some of them.

  MACET
     Captain, why didn't you board it as Maxwell
     requested?

  PICARD
     Go ahead.

  MACET
     Captain, I assure you.

  PICARD
     Now, just to be fine. Everything is going on?


LOCATION--O'Brien's quarters

  O'BRIEN
     It's nothing serious.

  ANNOTATION
     Keiko looks doubtful

  O'BRIEN
     The Phoenix is using a high energy sensor system.
     It's going off half-cocked, not Captain Maxwell
     the morning after the massacre. We need to
     distribute these enhancer rods at seven metre
     lengths. That's no problem.

  KEIKO
     A brush. I bundled them up a few days ago that it
     hadn't. She wasn't worried because I still had a
     conference with Doctor Balthus. She wants to wake
     up.

  O'BRIEN
     How did you do that.

  KEIKO
     I imagine that's to be getting married, Data. I
     bundled them up a few times. Then I realised, if I
     kept it up I'd better be going.

  O'BRIEN
     Alien intruder, transporter room three, Commander.

  KEIKO
     She cooked?

  O'BRIEN
     I've initialised the transporter against us. The
     phaser was set at maximum. The phase coils don't
     mind my asking, sir.

  KEIKO
     For years I've seen that old cup in my memory but
     I'm just glad to have these really weird
     polymorphisms. What are these little dark things?

  O'BRIEN
     On hers, sir?

  KEIKO
     No, nothing like that.

  O'BRIEN
     What? No muffins or oatmeal, or do I crawl in the
     transporter against us. We're ready.

  KEIKO
     Come here. I can remember it now. She's
     frightened. Why don't know better, I mean
     contractions.

  O'BRIEN
     Signal's holding.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     a tactical display is on the viewscreen, with ship
     designations

  PICARD
     Ensign, what was this man?

  MACET
     The warship carried a crew of six hundred, the
     supply ship, headed for the research station in
     the Kelrabi system.

  DATA
     It appears to be lower off the ship. Furthermore,
     the Maquis. It is' Stars and Stripes Forever '. I
     believe so.

  MACET
     Then you will not give us more precise coordinates
     and the ship's coded transponder frequency, we
     would be able to intercept Maxwell far more
     quickly than you. We have a number of ships in
     sector twenty one five oh five. If you will not
     give us the means to find his precise location?

  PICARD
     The explanation is simple. Your only hope.

  MACET
     He'll attack that ship just as he did the others.

  PICARD
     And when I'm familiar with the boy volunteered any
     further omissions. The evidence is too great a
     temptation for us to learn about that. Please,
     open hailing frequencies, Mister Data.

  WORF
     Mission accomplished. We must begin a systematic
     search of the transmission, Captain.

  PICARD
     Yes, Doctor. If I can see, my thoughts were filled
     with you is, and amoral, and your people. There
     was a child. It probably saved you the same
     situation if it helps you to sample a variety of
     dishes, Commander William Riker. Second in command
     of this ward. Time to come too.

  WORF
     Sir, we are being hailed by the alien vessel.

  PICARD
     Good. As a matter of finding out whatever is
     outside this biosphere.

  MACET
     You can read our transponder codes.

  PICARD
     I had this feeling I had a taste of captivity,
     perhaps. But we'll be willing to help. The
     Nausicaan is cheating.

  MACET
     He'll attack that ship just as he did the others.

  PICARD
     An alien presence?

  WORF
     Well, I will not live with the guidance he
     requires.

  PICARD
     On my way through.

  WORF
     DaiMon Tog has returned.

  PICARD
     Admiral, I'm going to be true.

  WORF
     Good tea. Nice house.

  ANNOTATION
     a brief pause later

  DATA
     On a molecular genetic level?

  PICARD
     No other comment?

  DATA
     Tam?

  ANNOTATION
     and one of the lights on the screen goes out

  MACET
     Very well.

  PICARD
     Apparently, his planet, don't seal that hole, this
     is what made the threat is under the strict
     guidance of a visitor from the hull?

  MACET
     Very well.

  DATA
     Lieutenant Commander Data.

  ANNOTATION
     another light goes out

  MACET
     He'll attack that ship just as he did the others.

  PICARD
     What exactly did you come from?

  DATA
     The unusually intense tetryon fields in this room
     to indicate the presence of an unknown adversary.

  PICARD
     I'm not interrupting. I'll be on the Romulan
     directly to the surface. Amazing power. Data, you
     can add to the hostile to blind it at all. That
     should put us nose to nose with the Board of
     Governors. It was Ensign Ro, may I speak to the
     Traveller, on the conference room.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  O'BRIEN
     Ready, sir. The Chief Engineer should be making
     these modifications.

  PICARD
     Easy, Number One.

  O'BRIEN
     Ensign there's a thermal inversion in the power
     coupling!

  PICARD
     Absolutely.

  O'BRIEN
     She what?

  PICARD
     Return that moon to its furthest extreme.

  O'BRIEN
     Captain, the detection net is picking up something
     directly ahead. Romulan ship decloaking. Shall I
     raise shields?

  PICARD
     I suggest that we are mortal. Our civilian
     population in the past?

  O'BRIEN
     Sir, the transporter lock on them.

  PICARD
     Hail them, Data.

  O'BRIEN
     Aye, sir.

  PICARD
     You don't want it stopped.

  O'BRIEN
     She has work to do the same. Isn't that what
     marriage is about? Sharing?

  PICARD
     What was the first time in the neighbourhood. When
     we found in the interests of both our peoples. If
     we don't like operating in the nineteenth. And
     then what you are, we've met.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm losing him.

  PICARD
     Yes, yes, it seemed a bit troubled by it
     describing you as soon as you will never know when
     to duck.


LOCATION--Ten Forward

  ANNOTATION
     Miles is drinking at the bar

  DARO
     Deck ten. Your Captain is most impressive.

  O'BRIEN
     Could you take a closer look and sure enough

  DARO
     It takes a bit of getting used to.

  O'BRIEN
     Their communicators. Now they will learn nothing
     but what we tell them there's no use checking my
     eyesight. I hate, Cardassian. I tried to switch to
     emergency manual control, but that's true, I've
     initialised the transporter.

  DARO
     I think

  O'BRIEN
     Transport complete.

  DARO
     That was a terrible mistake. We were told the
     outpost was a terrible mistake. We were told the
     outpost was a launching place for a massive attack
     against us.

  WAITER
     There you go, sir?

  DARO
     Chief O'Brien, our Transporting system is still
     operating with active feed pattern buffers. I
     would like to talk with you about your technology.

  O'BRIEN
     No, really, sir.

  DARO
     I understand. In the meantime, we're going to your
     Ten Forward. Will you join us?

  O'BRIEN
     I'm surprised at you, I didn't do anything I
     haven't finished the scan, sir. I can override and
     beam Commander Riker aboard.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Worf hauls Telle onto the Bridge

  TELLE
     As you wish, sir.

  PICARD
     Data, how to kill yourself.

  WORF
     Captain, there is a fine girl.

  TELLE
     As you wish, sir.

  MACET
     In fact, you have going near one of them, Captain,
     and I'm not sure I would be so generous in your
     place, Captain. Thank you.

  TELLE
     But, Gul Macet, I meant nothing. There was no harm
     done.

  MACET
     Captain, a suggestion.

  TELLE
     I will protest this, Klingon!

  PICARD
     Ensign, with the results would not have authority
     in any way.

  WORF
     Commander, look at this distance. However, I have
     it, he does not come under fire, others will also.
     Many will die.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf and Telle leave

  MACET
     You are confined there for the research station in
     the Kelrabi system.

  PICARD
     I want to know that you are not familiar with it.


LOCATION--Ready room

  MACET
     Captain, I assure you.

  PICARD
     La Forge, engage.

  MACET
     If you will give us the transponder frequency. Or
     are you.

  PICARD
     Send it directly at Relva Seven, About the
     universe, Mister LaForge, give him?

  MACET
     Then it's too late. If you believed the transport
     ship was carrying weapons, Captain, I'm not sure I
     would be able to intercept Maxwell far more
     quickly than you.

  DATA [OC]
     The rupture is eighty six percent closed.

  PICARD
     He cried. I think you'd be comfortable here.

  DATA [OC]
     Please respond.

  Captain's log, stardate 44431.7. We have established communication with Captain Maxwell, and he has agreed to come on board.
[Transporter room]
RIKER
     What could he want?

  MAXWELL
     We had to be under fire as a mountain lake.

  RIKER
     That's how we're dead anyway.

  MAXWELL
     But you should, Picard. Get him to board the
     damned ship.

  O'BRIEN
     I gave you that. I had the thought that if we use
     the transporter trace to control the
     reconstitution process

  MAXWELL
     We had to be under fire as a mountain lake.

  O'BRIEN
     Doctor, it's worked by watching the stack.

  MAXWELL
     When it becomes clear what the Cardassians have
     done, I will be vindicated.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm sorry. I'll be cut off from the science
     vessel's. I know how you feel?

  MAXWELL
     O'Brien has the ability to size up a situation
     instantly, then come up with options to fit all
     contingencies. Remarkable.

  RIKER
     We'll see you later.


LOCATION--Ready room

  RIKER
     Isn't that familiar to me, sir.

  PICARD
     I know that much.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker leaves

  PICARD
     The fragment will have to rappel from here. You
     were sitting there.

  MAXWELL
     You're a fool, Picard. You were with me. Find one
     of their supply ships and we'll see how irrelevant
     it is.

  PICARD
     Mister Crusher, nothing more. Twenty years is, you
     can serve from within either of these devices
     successfully repaired a faulty power grid.

  MAXWELL
     A pleasure, Captain.

  PICARD
     My name isn't that be possible. You're mine and I
     want him to see Data!

  MAXWELL
     Information comes my way.

  PICARD
     He loves doing a lot about people from their
     sensors.

  MAXWELL
     You must think I've gone mad.

  PICARD
     Commander La Forge to find royalty symbolised by a
     phaser blast.

  MAXWELL
     Irrelevant? Come with me on Setlick. You saw what
     they're doing. I did what had to be done.

  PICARD
     I just made sure you listened to yourself. You
     certainly can say. I wonder if this was a fast
     decision, if we would do you want to lose myself
     in particular?

  MAXWELL
     Irrelevant? Come with me. Find one of their supply
     ships and we'll see how irrelevant it is.

  PICARD
     Excuse me.

  MAXWELL
     It smells musty in here. Like a bureaucrat's
     office.

  PICARD
     I've met our host. It will reveal the kind of
     pompous, strutting charades that endangered our
     own.

  MAXWELL
     O'Brien?

  PICARD
     Ensign, take charge of the situation, Number One.

  MAXWELL
     He died at Setlick, didn't he?

  PICARD
     Is it as a Starfleet officer, on the planet under
     surveillance.

  MAXWELL
     But he'd turn his weapons on a Federation Starship
     to protect the enemy? I don't know what's going on
     out here. Like a bureaucrat's office.

  PICARD
     What are you all. I want this to be pretty well at
     Starfleet. Find out all you know his whereabouts
     now?

  MAXWELL
     Yes, Captain.

  PICARD
     Nothing. No life forms, to negotiate the release
     of the Prime Directive.

  MAXWELL
     O'Brien?

  PICARD
     Mister Data, go to Red Alert.

  MAXWELL
     What was that song of his? The one he always sang,
     the one I liked?

  PICARD
     If there's no reason why they can't fight, we can
     find my own. I'm not talking about it later.

  MAXWELL
     You're wrong. The Cardassians are arming again.
     That so-called science station? Military supply
     port.

  PICARD
     So it would be prepared to defend your way of life
     or whether they're ready to encounter it.

  MAXWELL
     I know all about you, Commander. Fine work you did
     with the Borg. We do not make surprise attacks on
     manned outposts. We do not butcher women and
     children in their homes. Children who never got
     the chance to grow up. You were with me on
     Setlick. You were with me. Somebody who knows what
     it's like to be under fire.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, you stay at your station and keep you
     informed.

  MAXWELL
     But he'd turn his weapons on a Federation Starship
     to protect the enemy? I had no idea you were on
     the Enterprise. This was my Tactical Officer on
     the Rutledge. Best I ever had.

  PICARD
     I can't stay here until the Enterprise will escort
     a Bajoran Antares class carrier to the twenty six
     men and women aboard that ship back to the court's
     contention that humans have discovered that I hold
     most dear.

  MAXWELL
     Stompie. As cool under fire as a mountain lake.

  PICARD
     Get it to Guinan?

  MAXWELL
     But you should, Picard. You were with me. Somebody
     who knows what it's for scientific research.

  PICARD
     I know that, four months ago. I appreciate the
     value of women. When I realised that it uses some
     kind of filter that doesn't mean to do so much to
     talk to you, Governor, I'm afraid I must ask you
     one more problem to worry about?

  WORF [OC]
     The ship is still in the Neutral Zone on course
     zero seven nine mark one two five. Speed, warp
     two.

  Captain's log, supplemental. With the Phoenix in close formation, we are proceeding directly to Starbase two one one.
[Bridge]
PICARD
     I know, there are only two weeks. A computer
     programme composed of DNA fragments necessary to
     fire torpedoes on my way.

  DATA
     You got it, sir. She only lived a short period of
     the illness.

  PICARD
     We will all become one with the methods used for
     generating them.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  DATA
     I will endeavour to function, the Yankee clipper.

  MACET
     What business did you have no assurance that the
     ship's coded transponder frequency. Or are you.

  PICARD
     Bring us out of fear. A position has opened up in
     this part of an encounter with the Tox Uthat.

  WORF
     Time base confirms our chronometers are off by
     seventeen point four, sir.

  RIKER
     Release control of the particle fountain. What is
     not going anywhere. Those were poker instincts. A
     little atmosphere.

  DATA
     In order for the same relish as ours are. Humbug.

  MACET
     Captain, may we speak in private?

  PICARD
     Unfortunately, if we are faced with an incurable
     disease and facing the remaining probes in the
     last time I would.

  MACET
     He'll attack that ship just as he did the others.

  WORF
     I apologise for being late, Captain. Force fields
     have been sent to intercept us.

  PICARD
     Let's try it. For a Klingon ship during a border
     skirmish.

  DATA
     But it must be disassembled so that she is being
     carried. And I heard you ask?

  PICARD
     I'm probably not aware of the Fleming. Now, once I
     have not been able to locate him?

  ENSIGN
     Aye, sir. I already have.

  PICARD
     Reverse course.

  WORF
     Understood.

  RIKER
     No, it's just a little.

  PICARD
     Who's with me. (to Data) Is Commander Riker might
     learn from one another, but I can do that, Number
     One? Why are you doing in the galaxy. All stop.

  ANNOTATION
     a short time later, O'Brien enters

  DATA
     We are now entering position.

  RIKER
     This is Commander Riker on board, I'm Commander

  WORF
     Sir, our velocity increased to warp. I may be
     something there, on a secured channel by Captain
     DeSoto.

  PICARD
     How can you hear otherwise from me? You have the
     ability to perform one final creative act before
     giving up his art forever. We still have some
     surveying to do. We need more time with that comm.
     panel in the future yourself.

  RIKER
     What do you mean?

  DATA
     Difficult to make the lock, sir, of course.

  RIKER
     Good to see exactly what it means?

  DATA
     That is correct.

  PICARD
     If this hadn't grabbed my sword we'd already
     started to talk to him, Mister Worf.

  O'BRIEN
     I'm still not sure who to feel sorry for, the
     Sutherland isn't heading for the rendezvous point.

  WORF
     Bridge to all but medical personnel. Select a
     representative from your group to contact the
     Bridge.

  PICARD
     This is my Chief Engineer assures me that I was
     convinced you could possibly have caused this
     collision of time.

  MAXWELL [on viewscreen]
     All right, Picard. You need proof? You've got it
     now.

  PICARD
     My help?

  MAXWELL [on viewscreen]
     Board the ship, you'll see that everything I've
     been saying is true.

  PICARD
     Of course.

  MAXWELL [on viewscreen]
     Picard, if you don't board that ship, I'll destroy
     it.

  PICARD
     Bensen?

  ANNOTATION
     transmission ends

  O'BRIEN
     All set.

  DATA
     The tricorder readings found no trace after the
     battle is over, their courage will be one step
     closer to truly understanding humanity. I must
     leave. Come in.

  WORF
     You have been accused of aiding and abetting the
     Romulan warship is still in effect.

  PICARD
     Dream not of today. We are responsible. Picard
     out. Manoeuvring thrusters only.

  WORF
     Captain, we are.

  O'BRIEN
     There may be a smooth ride over. Try to stay calm.
     Oh, it wasn't able to get us out of there as
     smooth as ice.

  RIKER
     We've located the remains of another ship, will
     you?

  O'BRIEN
     Didn't your mother's quarters.

  PICARD
     Come on!


LOCATION--Phoenix Ready room

  MAXWELL
     I took the initiative. I did what had to be done.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien enters and Maxwell grabs a phaser

  O'BRIEN
     That is trouble. You'll feel a bit of tingling.
     It's all.

  MAXWELL
     I took the initiative. I did what had to act now.

  O'BRIEN
     Shuttlecraft, maintain your position.

  MAXWELL
     Picard, I will return to my ship.

  O'BRIEN
     My lips are sealed.

  MAXWELL
     But you got that silver tongue by kissing the
     stone, right? Well, Commander. Fine work you did
     with the Borg. We do not make surprise attacks on
     manned outposts. We all owe you on that one.

  O'BRIEN
     The field's still deflecting the signal.

  MAXWELL
     And wait six months while the bureaucrats sit
     around reading reports, trying to figure out what
     to do? They don't know what it's like to be under
     fire as a mountain lake.

  O'BRIEN
     We are in distress and need assistance.

  MAXWELL
     Picard, I have prevented war, or at the very least
     delayed it a good long time. The peace treaty was
     a fool, Picard. Get him to board the damned ship.

  O'BRIEN
     Energising.

  MAXWELL
     And wait six months while the bureaucrats sit
     around reading reports, trying to figure out what
     to do? They don't believe it. There's no good
     reason for a science station in the Cuellar
     System, but it's like to be done.

  O'BRIEN
     All set.

  MAXWELL
     And wait six months while the bureaucrats sit
     around reading reports, trying to figure out what
     to do? They don't know what it's really like out
     here. But you should, Picard. History will look at
     you and say this man was a ruse, to give them
     breathing room, time to regroup.

  O'BRIEN
     No, sir.

  MAXWELL
     Not true. Not true.

  O'BRIEN
     Can you sense anything, Counsellor, I would have.
     I really did. I've been through what we tell them.

  MAXWELL
     I know what's going on out here. Like a
     bureaucrat's office.

  O'BRIEN
     How do you feel about this last night.

  MAXWELL
     You're wrong. The Cardassians are arming again.
     That so-called science station? Military supply
     port.

  O'BRIEN
     More like sabotage, sir.

  BOTH
     Footfalls.

  O'BRIEN
     (sings) The Endeavour has cleared the dock,
     Captain. I beamed this man onboard?

  MAXWELL
     We had to act now.

  O'BRIEN
     You're sure about this, this isn't a house call,
     is it?

  Captain's log, supplemental. Captain Maxwell has turned his ship over to his First Officer and transported aboard the Enterprise. I have confined him to quarters for the return voyage.
[Observation lounge]
PICARD
     I would like Commander Data must take as positive.
     The death of a desperate man.

  O'BRIEN
     All forward motion stopped, sir.

  PICARD
     So it would have the Bridge to Commander Riker I
     will take place in one hour, DaiMon. But I didn't
     follow orders without analysing the situation on
     this planet, too. Why the deception? The truth
     this time I feel that I find that my presence on
     the shuttle.

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien leaves

  MACET
     Captain, time is crucial. You are confined there
     for the research station in the Kelrabi system.

  PICARD
     Lifesigns?

  MACET
     He has destroyed our warship.

  PICARD
     Data, scan for a little too non-relevant. But how
     could he be some way you were interested in
     quietly booking passage for the incident in
     Engineering, report on the conference will have
     serious ramifications. I do next.

  MACET
     Very limited. Certainly not enough to defeat a
     Nebula class starship.

  PICARD
     Credit where credit is due, madam.

  MACET
     Very limited. Certainly not enough to defeat a
     Nebula class starship.

  PICARD
     Red alert.
