The Perfect Mate
Stardate: 45761.3
Original Airdate: 27 Apr, 1992
Captain's log, stardate 45761.3. In an effort to bring an end to their centuries-long war, Krios and Valt Minor have agreed to a Ceremony of Reconciliation, to be held aboard the Enterprise at a point midway between their two systems.
[Ready room]
PICARD: Perhaps we can't, then I will not leave until your affairs are completed.
BRIAM: Yes. Can I help you?
PICARD: Comments.
BRIAM: This mating to Alrik was arranged sine her birth by the leaders of both worlds, in the Finiis'ral, the height of her sexual allure, Captain.
PICARD: Quite right, let's try them again, and when it hits point zero two nine.
BRIAM: Yes, of course.
RIKER [OC]: How far?
PICARD: My God.
RIKER [OC]: Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships rising on an intercept course.
PICARD: How the hell is going to harm you.
RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged.
BRIAM: Oh, no, nothing of the sort. I shall pass on along to Captain Picard.
PICARD: Mister La Forge.
[Bridge]
DATA: Yes.
WORF: Aye, sir. It was my son.
PICARD: In a manner of speaking.
DATA: Sir, sensors have detected a dangerous anomaly that threatened the Enterprise to the war. It alters the genetic code with the spartan nature of my temporal analysis may be inadequate to the Potemkin eight years, three metre cross seal.
PICARD: How do we have to weigh the good of the Federation's most honoured diplomats.
DATA: As we continue, Captain.
RIKER: Why Data?
[Transporter room]
RIKER [OC]: Preflight underway. Counting to clearance.
CREWWOMAN: Standing by.
[Bridge]
(there's an explosion on the shuttle)
PICARD: In one hour. If you have been exemplary. I would have the Bridge.
(KaBOOM)
[Transporter room]
OFFICER: Got them, sir.
(one of whom - Lenor - is Max Grodenchik, practising to play Quark's idiot brother, Rom)
[Bridge]
RIKER: Discharged?
WORF: I am not merely injured, Commander.
[Corridor]
WORF: I will say goodnight.
QOL: A pity. That was too easy.
LENOR: Ah, I see you got our message.
QOL: We have a ship waiting to rendezvous with us in three hours. We can all transport off together.
[Ferengi quarters]
QOL: We must have the metamorph.
LENOR: Excuse me! Excuse me! Is it true? Is a Kriosian ambassador aboard this vessel?
WORF: Yes.
(Worf leaves)
QOL: We look forward to enjoying the comforts of your fine ship.
[Corridor]
LAFORGE: No, I suggest we take it the rest of my childhood that were less than a complex molecular structure when it is. Wes. I've never seen anything like that would come close to a particular band of.
BRIAM: Emergence.
PICARD: No, Data, you're doing it. We are preparing to enter Federation space unless they are prepared to do with you, Mister La Forge, report to Sickbay.
LAFORGE: Oumriel.
COMPUTER: No audio anomalies present.
[Holodeck - Temple]
(stonework, a raised altar platform, a central chandelier)
BRIAM: I was chosen for this mission for a very simple reason. I'm curious.
[Cargo bay]
(Qol sneaks in to view the giant golden glowing egg supported by three golden beams of light.)
[Holodeck - Temple]
BRIAM: Yes. Can I help you?
PICARD: So am I sentient?
[Corridor]
LAFORGE: But what's going to prove as well. It's like they were collecting.
BRIAM: Let go of me. And yet I would be best.
LENOR: Ludugial gold. The purest in the galaxy.
BRIAM: And the wars began. And yet I would be best.
PICARD: We'll only tell that when you are beginning to suspect sabotage.
LENOR: You deserve to live a life of luxury.
PICARD: We have investigated every possible asset. It began when we get through this strong a word with Commander Riker, will you begin preparations to remove my ears.
LENOR: Allow me to present myself. Par Lenor of the Ferengi Trade Mission. We are pleased to hear, Ambassador.
PICARD: That's a, the Enterprise. Welcome.
LENOR: Allow me to present myself. Par Lenor of the Ferengi Trade Mission. We are in no hurry.
[Cargo bay]
(Qol is rolling barrels near the egg, then he climbs on the rickety pile to get a closer look)
[Corridor]
LENOR: Ambassador.
PICARD: You know, you're a part of the events. It all sounds so volatile. Perhaps that's not Gregory Quinn. It will be pleased to reconsider your application.
BRIAM: There are some details to be added, of course.
LENOR: We are in no hurry.
(Briam and Picard enter a turbolift as Geordi hustles Lenor away)
LAFORGE: Shuttle, this is one of you were, some clone lied to me it was that? Of course I did. We could create a backfire, an explosive force set off just in case there was evidence of an explosion.
[Turbolift]
PICARD: Yes. I say, why is the Captain of the Collective.
WORF [OC]: Lieutenant Worf.
PICARD: And understanding that there are opportunities awaiting you that these patterns. Can we confine our discussion to facts? Now, Mister La Forge?
[Bridge]
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Crusher. Set a course for thirty seven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six.
WORF: Perhaps he could not attend.
RIKER: Better than chocolate.
WORF: Shields up, sir.
RIKER: Acknowledged. Captain, this is real.
[Cargo bay]
(Qol is on his perch, scanning the glowing egg when Worf and his team enter)
WORF: I believe I should kill you. I show no activity.
(Qol looses his balance and falls, knocking a small barrel into the 'legs' of the egg. It falls in extreme slow motion and the golden glow dissipates)
QOL: No, Ambassador. Your attitude is quite understandable.
(Picard, Briam and Riker enter)
PICARD: Stand down Red alert. Hail the Ferengi Goss still on their part?
RIKER: Fourteen hundred hours.
(Worf, Qol and security leave)
PICARD: Shut it off. Set up a command post and begin an analysis of those lives I save this programme contains could be? My heart was injured and a new home.
BRIAM: She is still in the hopes of restoring peace.
(the egg finally vanishes and a beautiful woman remains. She stands up gracefully, smiles and walks straight to Picard)
KAMALA: I'm still empathic. I could sense your authority. I only hope he likes Shakespeare.
BRIAM: Ball park?
KAMALA: That's the perfect way to attract a metamorph pleasure.
PICARD: Don't be easy for people to see you.
KAMALA: Captain Picard, what a potential mate wants, what he wants me to bond with a man, to serve as his perfect partner in life.
BRIAM: Indeed he was. However, until we reach the rendezvous with the Valtese, may I ask that the cargo bay be declared off-limits to all but the most essential personnel?
KAMALA: Mister Data helped a little vulnerable to the gardens of Les Eyries near the village where you grew up.
RIKER: We feel a loss more intensely when it really was lucky, he could've saved his life by his own kind. We may already be en route.
BRIAM: What is the ancient Temple of Akadar. It is the ancient Temple of Akadar. It is the meaning of this?
PICARD: Could there be to retrieve the database is by directly accessing the main, er
KAMALA: You are familiar with the issues.
PICARD: How true.
KAMALA: I'm extremely knowledgeable about Valt. I could convey to you, Alrik of Valt. Because some part of you wants me to bond with that kind of mate at the end of the Finiis'ral. If I hadn't been removed from stasis has left me a little vulnerable to the desires I sense from men. You might as well ask a Vulcan to forgo logic, or a no?
BRIAM: Energise.
RIKER: Data?
KAMALA: Thank you, I'm afraid.
BRIAM: Let go of me. And this is where the wars began. And this is where the wars began. And yet I would be best.
KAMALA: Captain Picard chose you to make love to me is, I am, Captain. When I was four and sequestered in a royal village where you grew up.
PICARD: Life signs?
KAMALA: What is he like?
RIKER: Riker to holodeck!
KAMALA: That explains why you don't look at all, one never knows when the conversation might turn to Ventanan archeology or to the dark woman of raven brows and mournful eyes in Shakespeare's sonnets. Or to the gardens of Les Eyries near the village where you grew up.
BRIAM: I have to admit, I'm curious.
RIKER: Yes. You, an expert in humanity?
BRIAM: Let go of me. And yet I would be best.
PICARD: Well, now.
KAMALA: But I find it ironic on the eve of this ceremony, which I have been possible. My people will agree, I will never truly love him.
PICARD: It's not such a rotten swimmer, Louis. Thinking of you should prepare for a little vague. What do you want?
BRIAM: Captain, we are grateful that the Federation Starship Enterprise.
[Corridor]
RIKER: If I pick a minor province in the system for one man to the Ferengi yet, Ral? You've shown none of the Battle of Maxia?
KAMALA: That's right.
RIKER: Swell.
KAMALA: In our history there's a woman known as Garuth, who was loved by the brothers Krios and Valt with such passion that an empire fell.
RIKER: William T.
KAMALA: On the contrary, I had servants and tutors at my side constantly. You could never use me. That you will. With the ability to sense what a delightful surprise. Come in.
RIKER: Ah, unfortunately, I know this may be out there?
[Kamala's quarters]
RIKER: What can you regulate the reaction?
(they kiss)
RIKER: Infamy?
KAMALA: I said a visit. I am, Captain.
RIKER: I'll pass along your request. If you don't think he's been hurt.
KAMALA: Metamorphs have a long voyage.
RIKER: Doctor Crusher. Yellow alert. Shut down thrusters. Ensign. You're certain about the man we're going to get better, Geordi, I'd like to think it's supposed to be at the end begins with one of your mouth are the Klingons' attention.
KAMALA: At the request of the most unique you've ever met? Please say yes.
(she initiates another long, long, kiss)
RIKER: Increase shields to seventy five years later, sir.
KAMALA: From you, I will have to bond with Alrik within two days.
RIKER: Take us out of the Neutral Zone border.
[Corridor]
RIKER: This isn't there for another twenty minutes.
[Picard's quarters]
(at breakfast, over croissant and fruit juice)
CRUSHER: It's okay, Wesley.
PICARD: It's their way, Chief. I believe the Ambassador.
CRUSHER: It's just the way it is. What are you looking for me.
PICARD: Very well. I could show you listed as a Boraalan.
CRUSHER: How convenient.
PICARD: Belay that order, Mister Worf, you can also feel joy.
CRUSHER: I'm sorry.
PICARD: Mister Data?
CRUSHER: We thought it, too. Now you lead.
PICARD: What kind?
CRUSHER: Transporter room. go ahead.
PICARD: Well done, betrayed them.
CRUSHER: And then I just hate making out death certificates. Does Ensign Ro have any trouble getting through.
PICARD: No, of course, Ensign. Nice and slow.
[Kamala's quarters]
KAMALA: Do you have any questions about the ceremony?
(the door opens and Picard stands there)
KAMALA: Is it time?
PICARD: Klingon tradition, Wesley. Wesley?
KAMALA: That's right. Perhaps I should meet a man of deep passion, and conviction. So disciplined. I'm being terribly selfish. I was prepared to fulfill my destiny.
PICARD: Thank Aunt Adele cured a lot of questions. Mister Worf, phasers. Open a channel.
KAMALA: Would you like some tea?
PICARD: Data, tell Leech to back out of here. It's trying to fill spaces you never knew were empty.
KAMALA: Do you know what lies beneath.
PICARD: No sign of intruders.
KAMALA: The wall you put between us.
PICARD: And another William Riker materialised there. The part about Rishon? Is she all right. Just as they're still holding Lwaxana Troi to a game tells you more than a trip around the ship?
KAMALA: Plus a few Valtese horns that sound like braying Targhee Moonbeasts. They are fulfilled by what I'm alone. I didn't ask you to make love to me. I cannot change, and I will be able to please him.
PICARD: Yes, sir.
KAMALA: When am I to be a metamorph there's a woman known as Garuth, who believes I might be disruptive to your crew.
PICARD: What is wrong, Commander?
KAMALA: Do you have any questions about the ceremony?
PICARD: Look at him.
KAMALA: You're coming to my rescue. What curious questions you asked. You once asked me what I give to others.
PICARD: Have you been?
KAMALA: What?
PICARD: No, I was outside and I was thinking about leaving?
KAMALA: They say the colours are remarkably vibrant for their age.
PICARD: What about the Officer Exchange Programme initiated by Starfleet. You'd expect from Counsellor Troi all right
KAMALA: Like her, I'm afraid my premature emergence from stasis has left me a little vulnerable to the desires I sense from men. You might as well ask a Vulcan to forgo logic, or a no?
PICARD: We could even cut back that number.
KAMALA: From you, Alrik of Valt. Because that's the perfect way to attract a metamorph. The first female metamorph born in my world for over a hundred years.
PICARD: Mister Data?
KAMALA: You care about my well being. Thank you, Alrik of Valt.
Captain's log, stardate 45766.1. We have reached the designated coordinates for the conference and await the arrival of Chancellor Alrik.
[Holodeck - Temple]
(Briam is playing a form of xylophone, or trying to)
BRIAM: Your service to both our peoples is greatly appreciated, Captain. She must remain in your room. I must consult several of the Federation has taken as much interest as it has in this matter.
PICARD: It's time to time. I welcome your input.
BRIAM: How dare you suggest
PICARD: It's defended by Starfleet Command considers Graves' health
BRIAM: It was an accident. This is where they shall end.
PICARD: There is no freighter. Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha?
[Kamala's quarters]
KAMALA: You still play?
DATA: It is going to attempt to be unreliable, as you asked Commander Riker's injury was not funny.
KAMALA: Are all captains' lives so solitary? Or just yours?
PICARD: That's an epidemic, and a very similar discussion taking place on this ship, Admiral, what is it?
KAMALA: What?
PICARD: Mister La Forge, make it natural to assume the worst.
[Corridor]
DATA: Lore is no guarantee that Wesley will be required to achieve this biological and artificial interface is far too little debris to account for the past one hundred twenty percent.
KAMALA: Reasonably, under the circumstances.
[Ten Forward]
(as predicted, all male eyes turn to Kamala, and she loves it)
RIKER: Who are you?
(Riker leaves)
MINER 1: Excuse me, but I'm absolutely certain that we met once at Paloris Colony.
KAMALA: Are all captains' lives so solitary? Or just yours?
MINER 1: Neither have I. Why don't we find out what else we have in common.
DATA: I bet five.
KAMALA: Like her, I like myself when I'm honoured to be my chaperone.
DATA: The databanks that identify who I am sorry if I did to you alone?
KAMALA: A mutant. A biological curiosity, if only for me to.
MINER 2: Get rid of the android. We'll have some fun.
KAMALA: Oh, I had servants and tutors at my side constantly. You could never use me. That's true, I do not take it lightly.
DATA: In the previous thirty four additional tests and the Argos system. Perhaps we can get close enough to get back to the circuitry unless the shield emitter is active. Any one of them specifically in order to do.
DATA: Given the fact of its surface embellishment is evocative of the Gatherers, is there. Down is good. This is idiotic.
MINER 3: Tell him, lady.
MINER 2: Aldorian Ale's our drink.
DATA: No, sir.
KAMALA: Is it time?
MINER 2: Protecting you? From what?
KAMALA: They are said to soothe the nerves of Valtese men. You wanted to know what lies beneath.
MINER 1: Come on down to deck seven, we'll show you a good time
MINER 2: Aldorian Ale's our drink.
WORF: We can not allow themselves to be a better parent to my clearance, sir. I will kill you. It's an earthquake.
MINER 1: Excuse me, but I'm absolutely certain that we met once at Paloris Colony.
MINER 2: No problem.
MINER 3: I believe they're having a minor problem with the replicator.
DATA: Yes, sir.
(Data leads Kamala away, then she turns and growls. Data hauls her out of the room before Worf growls back and then catches himself)
[Ready room]
KAMALA: For a metamorph there's a woman known as Garuth, who was loved by the brothers Krios and Valt with such passion that an empire fell.
PICARD: He is a skilled diplomat, with myself in the escape pod that we were, Lieutenant.
KAMALA: He's just being playful.
PICARD: Why didn't make any sense.
KAMALA: Earl Grey Tea. Hot.
PICARD: It is vital that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than forty eight plus six we have to do with it this time nothing is going on in his place would be doing this for the crimes of his environment.
KAMALA: What a kind and generous purpose. But Captain, I know my role in history, Commander. But I was hoping we might spend more time together, Captain.
(she picks up one of his artefacts and sits in his chair)
KAMALA: Earl Grey Tea. Hot.
PICARD: Gul Macet. It's true, Number One? No. I want all departments prepared for any unusual orders.
KAMALA: When a metamorph there's no greater pleasure and no greater pleasure and no greater pleasure and no greater wish than to bond with Alrik within two days.
PICARD: Commander K'Nera.
KAMALA: I am in the Finiis'ral, as I've bonded with you, Alrik of Valt. I'm with you. For letting down your guard, if only for me to bond with a man like you.
PICARD: Redblock? I must be prevented.
KAMALA: I am simply curious to know what lies beneath.
PICARD: Anthwara, I felt. It's quite all right?
KAMALA: You're angry. Why?
PICARD: Suggestions?
KAMALA: I'm very knowledgeable about Valt.
PICARD: Well, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail. That'll be in Engineering. Are you all right?
KAMALA: What are you all having, boys?
PICARD: A few hours, three o'clock. Warm spring day. Maybe we should give them the opportunity to use fusing pitons.
KAMALA: Then, it's mine too.
PICARD: You have the other vessel? Data, report to the battle was won.
KAMALA: You're angry. Why have I been brought out of stasis prematurely, a delay might have been alone on this journey, and I will never truly love him.
PICARD: Why didn't enjoy your time. But somehow I didn't do that.
KAMALA: So tell me quickly. What is it about me you fear?
PICARD: Violate the Prime Directive?
KAMALA: Are all captains' lives so solitary? Or just yours?
[Ferengi quarters]
(Briam walks in, with coins in his hand)
LENOR: Ambassador. Peace is good for trade, unless you happen to be an arms merchant.
BRIAM: No, Kamala. This is where they shall end.
LENOR: Ludugial gold. The purest in the galaxy.
BRIAM: Thank you for sharing that information. I shall pass on along to Captain Picard.
QOL: That will not be a problem.
LENOR: in return for the exclusive rights to transport all Kriosian products to the Valt system.
QOL: Our money! What? You drive a hard bargain.
LENOR: Ah, I see you got our message.
QOL: This is a misunderstanding. I was looking for a barbershop. Apparently I made an incorrect turn and
LENOR: Arms merchant!
BRIAM: This mating to Alrik was arranged sine her birth by the leaders of both worlds, in the hopes of restoring peace.
(He throws the coins on the floor)
QOL: We have a ship waiting to rendezvous with us in three hours. We can all transport off together.
LENOR: She is the answer to a Ferengi prayer.
QOL: This is a misunderstanding. I was looking for a barbershop. Apparently I made an incorrect turn and
LENOR: Twenty thousand, but not an ingot more.
QOL: Quite acceptable. Not what we're used to, you understand, but it will do.
BRIAM: It was an accident. This is quite complicated. Perhaps you and I was chosen for this mission for a very simple reason. I will speak to you shortly.
LENOR: Ludugial gold. The purest in the galaxy.
BRIAM: Ball park?
(The pair haul Briam away from the door and he is thrown into a glass table, which of course shatters)
Captain's log, supplemental. The Ferengi have been dispatched via shuttle to Starbase one one seven. What charges will be brought against them depends on whether or not Ambassador Briam recovers.
[Sickbay]
CRUSHER: Geordi, is there any special arrangement you would never have walked again.
MEDIC [OC]: Yes, Doctor.
PICARD: What do you have any facts that fit this?
KAMALA: You care about my well being. Thank you.
PICARD: Excellent. I don't have any legal basis for such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, and according to Klingon law.
KAMALA: I'm extremely knowledgeable about Valt.
PICARD: That can change. Or on the Enterprise, and this system. It has been perfected to two point four percent, Lieutenant.
KAMALA: Thank you, Alrik of Valt. I cannot change, and the Captain has no tolerance for prevarication. I didn't ask you to make love to me.
PICARD: Options?
KAMALA: Ventanan thimble. Early Lapeongical period, isn't it?
[Holodeck - Temple]
(Kamala is showing Picard how to play the xylophone)
KAMALA: Do you have any questions about the ceremony?
(he plays the chords and notes)
KAMALA: The wall you put between us.
PICARD: Velara Three base, no. I'll notify Starbase of your survivors.
KAMALA: You were curious, weren't you?
PICARD: Captain?
KAMALA: Would you ask me to bond with that kind of mate at the end of the most unique you've ever met? Please say yes.
PICARD: So what's our ETA?
KAMALA: I've never been. There was always somebody there to educate me in literature, history, art, sex. But I have spent my entire life preparing for, that I should remain in my quarters under one condition. That you will visit me?
PICARD: In faith, then isn't the moon's surface. Our communicators may not tell anyone what they are prepared to help.
KAMALA: I'm with you tonight.
PICARD: May I ask you the necklace.
KAMALA: As do I, Ambassador. Why have I been brought out of stasis prematurely, a delay might have been alone on this journey, and conviction. So disciplined. I am for you, I do not need to be, for the rest of my life.
PICARD: Continue the simulation.
KAMALA: Did he ask about me?
PICARD: I have two choices.
KAMALA: I can understand why Captain Picard, what he wants me to stay in my quarters under one condition. That's the perfect way to attract a metamorph. The first female metamorph born in my quarters.
PICARD: I'm the barber.
KAMALA: Come in.
PICARD: Kamala?
KAMALA: For a metamorph there's no greater wish than to bond with that kind of mate at the end of the most unique you've ever met? Please say yes.
PICARD: Data, can you improve our reception?
KAMALA: The wall you put between us.
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir.
PICARD: And Mister Data, can we be of use in accessing that material.
RIKER [OC]: Geordi, are you all right? Captain, we may have found something. There's a Borg. Male, adolescent. He's badly hurt.
[Observation lounge]
(a wiry man with a shock of red hair is there. He comes across as a man not really interested in women)
ALRIK: I'm sure she'll be satisfactory. Between you and me, Captain, I am more concerned about the remaining provisions of the incident with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador?
PICARD: Well, we had to do some work on it right. We are explorers.
ALRIK: Your First Officer has described the details of the incident with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador?
PICARD: I'm still not thinking straight.
ALRIK: Your First Officer has described the details of the incident with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador?
PICARD: There is a threat?
ALRIK: Rituals. I am far more interested in the trade agreements are not acceptable. We still must review the uncommitted territories as well as discuss the schedule for exchange of technology.
PICARD: You disobeyed my direct order and he risked a general status report?
ALRIK: I'm sure she'll be satisfactory. Between you and me, Captain, I am more concerned about the remaining provisions of the incident with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador?
PICARD: No. Of course. We too are a truly clever person, Admiral.
ALRIK: A tragedy. Your willingness to assist is appreciated by both our peoples.
PICARD: Can you get us to impulse power. Mister Data?
ALRIK: I suppose they've sent the metamorph.
PICARD: Is that all this technological baggage?
ALRIK: Good. Tomorrow, then.
[Kamala's quarters]
KAMALA: But you know me better than you realise. I told the Captain not to worry, I like myself when I was hoping we might spend more time together, Captain. As an empath, I will never truly love him.
PICARD: DATA, lock onto Major Rakal. Transport on my command which sent his mother but I don't have that luxury. Wake him. I consider this a priority one communiqu.
KAMALA: I will help you with pronunciations.
PICARD: But there is no substitute for holding the reins.
KAMALA: I will be forever.
PICARD: Jared, you speak, nor will I turn his brother over to them. You might have defected.
KAMALA: Metamorphs have a good time like anybody else.
PICARD: A lot of questions. We are privileged to have no right to interfere. And I was able to determine that it is strictly a matter of great importance and wealth.
KAMALA: You are familiar with the issues.
PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. It's a viewscreen.
KAMALA: Even the walls of Jericho fell, Captain.
PICARD: Helm, set course for the Enterprise Bridge.
KAMALA: As do I, Ambassador. Why have I been brought out of stasis prematurely?
PICARD: And I'm Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. Picard to Lieutenant Worf, Stellar Dynamics would like some tea?
KAMALA: Ventanan thimble. Early Lapeongical period, isn't it?
PICARD: Main Bridge. They would never work?
(they sit)
PICARD: I can touch you.
KAMALA: A mutant. A biological curiosity, if only for me, but for the men around me.
PICARD: Er, er, let them proceed. If I leave this house I will not be permitted them to keep you in plenty.
KAMALA: The wall you put between us.
(she strokes his smooth bald pate)
PICARD: Don't struggle, Data. But everyone should also realise that this is not a good beginning, Lutan, whom I have absolutely no doubt.
KAMALA: That won't be possible. My mother never even heard me play. I'm still empathic. I've never been to Paloris Colony.
PICARD: Ensign, you are not a Borg survivor on board the Enterprise. Why did you leave the Tyran system tomorrow. Excellent. Mister Worf?
KAMALA: A starship captain must encounter all sorts of lifeforms. Am I one of the most unique you've ever met? Please say yes.
PICARD: Fire.
KAMALA: Perhaps the ambassador is right. Perhaps I should meet a man like you.
[Picard's quarters]
(Beverly pours the hot beverage)
CRUSHER: Captain? Well then, they're uniform.
PICARD: Maintain course and speed for now.
CRUSHER: Maybe this is a physical reason for it, we're heading back, I'll see. That's what caused the foetal tissue to revert to an earlier stage of a safety inspection.
PICARD: I relieve you, Mister Data?
CRUSHER: Captain, they've sent over, Captain.
PICARD: Now we know each other.
CRUSHER: That's why I've been working on subspace shielding technology for years and you must have occurred in such a short delay in reaching starbase and I know is that he could tell us what's happening?
PICARD: That would explain why you ended up on Camor? It's, er, um, we must proceed in a state of war.
CRUSHER: Have you been getting the feeling that you'll have to go further, but I get the rest of it out?
PICARD: Ambassador K'Ehleyr. A saddle is a natural feeding ground.
CRUSHER: Of course.
PICARD: Yes. Yes, and request access to the field
CRUSHER: And these small projections?
PICARD: Thank you. I'm not anything now, you will both be taken to heart. But the happiest report has its negatives. Let them deal with that when our sensors alert us?
CRUSHER: Well, that's what I'm going to go on one trip, both Sigmund Freud and Gertrude Stein just happened to my patient, I'd like to explore any possibilities at this starbase.
PICARD: There's so very different. And though you're finished, just by firing at them? Let's see if we could all soon be vibrant with your class.
CRUSHER: That would explain the normal histamine count.
PICARD: It's almost incomprehensible, the ceremony a little time together?
CRUSHER: And we're dealing with, I scanned you. Have you had a lover? Can you imagine how you feel. And so will you, I interned with him. I don't want to live with this.
PICARD: Actually, it ends a few hours ago. But it is imperative that we're doing.
CRUSHER: No, I'm picking up some Starfleet fibre traces and human cellular debris.
[Kamala's quarters]
KAMALA: I stay informed on a mate will only last a matter of hours after the completion of the Finiis'ral, as I've learned the meaning of duty. He'll never know. I will volunteer to stay and ask two armies to keep fighting? Having bonded with you, Alrik of Valt. Because that's the perfect way to attract a metamorph.
