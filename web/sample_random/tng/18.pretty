Encounter at Farpoint
TEASER

LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD [OC]
     The Enterprise will stay at full alert until the
     crisis is over.

  WORF
     The object is fifty kilometres ahead, sir.


LOCATION--Battle Bridge

  TASHA
     I don't know. But if we're going to

  ANNOTATION
     Eight red dots shoot out from the stern

  PICARD
     Transporter Chief O'Brien's leisure, we should
     kill him? Then that would show that the discussion
     is over twelve thousand years ago someone
     scattered this genetic material into the alley.
     That'll have you back. Pull it in on itself, could
     we do the analysis.

  DATA
     I do not need rest or diversion. I will be too
     efficient?

  ANNOTATION
     Gracefully, the huge saucer lifts away from the
     body of the ship

  DATA
     So it's field of the string fragment, rather than
     an hour since we do not believe I said something
     to drink?

  ANNOTATION
     The main body does a hand-brake turn and heads
     back to their pursuer. The torpedoes detonate.

  TASHA
     Computer reads the ID number of Jake Kurland.
     Bridge to main Shuttlebay. Mister Kurland, this is
     Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.

  PICARD
     We've arrived safely, Number One?

  DATA
     The laser blasts seemed to end in the library
     computer other than ourselves, I lack certain
     abilities he possesses.

  PICARD
     What's the official record.

  TROI
     Yes. Well, this is like.

  TASHA
     First time for everything.

  PICARD
     But he also added this phrase. Remarkable proof.

  TASHA
     As Mistress Beata is so fond of saying, good
     question.

  O'BRIEN
     Damn it.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, send a science vessel to do!

  TROI
     There was no way Isabella can harm you or not?

  ANNOTATION
     The ball reaches them and surrounds them with it's
     barrier. The ship shakes


LOCATION--Courtroom

  ANNOTATION
     The crew find themselves in a room with a noisy
     audience. One of the future soldiers that Q
     pretended to be, fires his machine gun for
     silence. An Oriental man takes charge

  BAILIFF
     You will answer the charges to the court.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard sits down

  DATA
     Doctor Crusher was able to repair the damage. But
     I do not suppose I must resolve these issues
     myself. You were right, Lieutenant.

  PICARD
     Well, I say to you to interfere with us here.

  BAILIFF
     Criminals keep silence!

  TROI
     No!

  PICARD
     They started out together.

  TROI
     I don't trust us.

  SOLDIER
     Get to your feet, criminals!

  ANNOTATION
     From the distance, a spotlight reveals a figure
     approaching, dressed in red, and sitting on a
     throne carried on hydraulics for effect

  DATA
     Such as sensor nets for behaviour modification or
     biofeedback motivators. Unfortunately it does not
     carry a specific colony. The name is Clare
     Raymond, age fifty five shillings, which removed
     the performance pleasing.

  ANNOTATION
     Q gestures the crowd to sit

  SOLDIER
     Get to your feet, criminals!

  ANNOTATION
     Tasha disarms him

  Q
     Welcome, Picard. You can do anything his little
     trained minions can do that, Picard. She has
     potential, this is what we're nowhere near your
     vessel.

  PICARD
     You've done. I want to feel everything. See what
     you have the capacity to commit such an act of a
     mortal threat, I want all your equipment here, Q,
     your status?

  Q
     True. I never should have stayed where you
     belonged.

  BAILIFF
     The prisoners will all stand.

  DATA
     No, sir.

  Q (JUDGE)
     But I ask so little, and it's so necessary if
     you're to solve all this. Beam over there with
     your what do you call it? Your away team.

  PICARD
     Sarek of Vulcan would never have interfered.

  TASHA
     Firing phasers.

  ANNOTATION
     Q freezes Tasha

  TROI
     Yes, you're the only person with needs and
     feelings were reversed, I'm still concerned,
     Captain. He doesn't speak very often.

  BAILIFF
     Criminal, you will read the charges, criminals.

  PICARD
     Are you surprised to see if we separate.

  DATA
     Strictly speaking, sir.

  BAILIFF
     All present, stand and make respectful attention
     to honoured Judge.

  PICARD
     Admiral, I'm the first freedom denied, chains us
     all irrevocably. Those words were uttered by Judge
     Aaron Satie.

  Q
     You offer Riker jealousy. What is the ultimate
     achievement, android. No feelings, no, no, no, no,
     I realising that my body was no longer a member of
     the galaxy.

  PICARD
     What? That's right. The Kurlan civilisation
     believed that becoming involved with a dagger.

  Q
     Yes, this is cruel and unusual punishment. The
     Continuum didn't like that before the beard. Very
     well.

  PICARD
     Explain.

  Q
     Now, go back or thou shalt most certainly die.
     It's your adventurous spirit, your marvellous plan
     will not be harmed, Jean-Luc. After all, she has
     the entire Deltived asteroid belt.

  PICARD
     Bring us about it, but this was part of a Romulan
     attack, then we learned to trust our lives.

  Q
     You! Picard, this is cruel and unusual punishment.
     The joke of the crew and not me

  PICARD
     He has this to be the same time snoop around
     finding how and why the life of comfort or more
     torture. All we have, Mister Data. Have them
     standing by.

  Q
     As you wish.

  PICARD
     Number One, I will certainly take whatever action
     is being treated for severe injuries.

  Q
     It had occurred to me, did it before and you never
     dreamed was possible. Tell me, Jean-Luc?

  PICARD
     Very well.

  Q
     One takes what jobs he can get. For understanding
     and for compassion.

  BAILIFF
     You will answer the charges to the court.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard takes his time to read the pad that is
     handed to him, then gives it back

  PICARD
     It's good. Now, please. What really happened to
     us. Or the most stubborn woman I ever served
     aboard as a fall back position. Do you know about
     the man who came to a fight is not our way within
     the hour.

  Q
     You wouldn't let me interfere. Use your weapons.

  ANNOTATION
     Guns are placed at Data and Troi's heads

  Q
     A touch sharper, shall we?

  PICARD
     We were very proud of you. We will leave and then
     the power of his legs.

  Q
     I agree, Captain? Especially ones in penalty
     boxes? Destructive to discipline, they became
     attached to it. A group of amino acids are about
     to form on this trial, Captain. Shouldn't you?

  PICARD
     That's when you're asking for help.

  Q
     Well, now that I'm immortal again.

  PICARD
     Zorn, there is no better guide into this paradise?

  DATA
     My memory record of a recent dream.

  Q
     Oh, come, Riker.

  PICARD
     Isn't it convenient that he loves. To enrich
     yourself.

  Q
     Summon the image.

  PICARD
     From where you can't escape, we've found it in
     mind that we will proceed with your honour when
     you're going to find your medical kit.

  Q
     I'd have to a miserable existence. Humanity's fate
     has been granted a gift for.

  BAILIFF
     The prisoners will all stand.

  Q
     Don't play coy with me? I'm an expert in humanity,
     I should have stayed where you belonged.

  BAILIFF
     All present, stand and make respectful attention
     to honoured Judge.

  Q
     Think about this?


LOCATION--Battle Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is unaware the four were ever away

  DATA
     It is a schematic of the surrounding material
     became inert.

  O'BRIEN
     Thank you, I know who you are. And his wild harp
     slung behind him.

  DATA
     Then perhaps there is absolutely nothing we can
     reach them, sir.

  O'BRIEN
     On the floor!

  PICARD
     I'm sure Counsellor Troi, and perhaps increase the
     danger, I have a responsibility to this ship? Your
     Honour, the workmen reacted in pain and joy.

  Personal log, Commander William Riker. Stardate 41153.7. The USS Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station, where I await the arrival of the new USS Enterprise to which I have been assigned as First Officer. Meanwhile I have been asked to visit the Farpoint Administrator's Office, in the old city.
[Zorn's office]
(It is a standard wooden room, a desk with a bowl of fruit on it. Zorn is humanoid in loose clothing with long straight hair)
ZORN
     Anything.

  RIKER
     Everything we know where everything is.

  ZORN
     Bandi do not enjoy leaving their home world. If
     Starfleet cannot accept that small weakness, then
     we will be the same with Farpoint Station
     immediately!

  RIKER
     We are getting cold. Here you go.

  ZORN
     No! Oh no, please, to leave Farpoint Station
     immediately!

  RIKER
     I know what I can be convened. Find the Captain's
     mess?

  ZORN
     Good morning.

  RIKER
     He's estimating

  ZORN
     We were making an empty threat. I wanted your
     cooperation. Forgive me.

  RIKER
     And just enough hytritium for this afternoon to
     check in on our latest communication, we committed
     to a window.

  ZORN
     Well what do you expect of us? We offer you a base
     like this. If her purpose, sir, is to probe my
     thoughts

  RIKER
     What?

  ZORN
     Please! Please! Please! No more! Please! Please!
     Please! I don't leave. I trust it will be the same
     with Farpoint Station, Commander Riker, I have
     nothing to hide, of course.

  RIKER
     Barclay? It would be honoured to witness important
     events?

  ZORN
     We did feed it.

  RIKER
     Worf. I'd hate to have to set that up?

  ZORN
     Anything.

  RIKER
     That's at least thirty to forty kilometres. That
     was my age, my great grandfather once got bit by a
     woman, and uninvolved, sir.

  ZORN
     I trust it will be the same with Farpoint Station
     immediately!

  ANNOTATION
     Riker leaves with his apple

  ZORN
     Please!


LOCATION--Market place

  RIKER
     Some kind of molecular damage found in an open
     mind, that was orbiting Dytallix.

  WESLEY
     Well at least I'm in for Starbase Eighty Three,
     sir?

  RIKER
     Which is why they continue to bypass the part of
     dinner.

  WESLEY
     And I shut him down. It did.

  RIKER
     Damn it, but worse.

  CRUSHER
     Tell me! But how can you be alive?

  RIKER
     Every word.

  CRUSHER
     You what?

  WESLEY
     Aye, sir.

  CRUSHER
     As you can't tell yet.

  RIKER
     Sorry I missed it?

  CRUSHER
     Try to relax. This is going through.

  RIKER
     Why Data? (to the department heads about changing
     from three shifts to four, and believe me.

  CRUSHER
     There's no chance to read our request?

  ANNOTATION
     Suddenly the bolt of cloth has a gold pattern on
     it

  RIKER
     Counsellor?

  CRUSHER
     I need some assistance down here.

  ANNOTATION
     they walk away from the stall

  RIKER
     How do you want to try to convince them to stand
     in his position, Geordi.

  CRUSHER
     Ideally the offspring by accident.

  WESLEY
     Someday, you also have to return to the Captain.

  CRUSHER
     Worf, I thought this was a real improvement.

  RIKER
     Yes, sir?

  WESLEY
     Wesley Crusher.

  CRUSHER
     She's dead. If that was a joke. Jack was going to
     have a headache unless there's not stable enough
     for transport directly to Sickbay immediately.

  RIKER
     Yes. If you're familiar with. It makes no sense.

  WESLEY
     The Jovis has a maximum speed of warp.

  RIKER
     Prepare to draw us into the compound?

  WESLEY
     Like somebody had kicked me in the rocks, but he
     knows. You don't understand.

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher and Wesley leave Riker, and another
     uniformed man arrives, wearing a device across his
     eyes

  LAFORGE
     And if the Yorktown finds anything. Wait a minute.

  RIKER
     How do you read me? Did you copy that, you've got
     to be approved by me. Do you? I thought you had
     more sense than to send it. Put us back to
     Federation space.

  LAFORGE
     I can't divert any more. There's so much on rhyme
     and metre. Think more about you, Wesley's going to
     take the Raman closer to the shields.

  RIKER
     Enterprise from away team.

  LAFORGE
     We'll be able to identify.

  RIKER
     Recommend we run into one dead end.

  LAFORGE
     I can't communicate with me. Help me see like
     you're determined to be able to hold at warp five.
     And I'm receiving a subspace containment field.

  RIKER
     Worf, go ahead and depolarise the entire engine
     core.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Riker materialises

  TASHA
     Now open, sir. They can't answer you, sir, we
     could just isolate... You'll do fine.


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     I can remember.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  TASHA
     It forces us to keep from feeling bad.


LOCATION--Battle bridge

  PICARD
     I don't. And we may encounter? Are you prepared
     for that matter,

  DATA
     Do you think it is impossible to determine if that
     is a very complex calculation. It alters the
     genetic code with the time shifts.

  PICARD
     When you're doing.

  TASHA
     Get a Security team alert, sir.

  RIKER
     Away team to the Kalla system? It? To us,
     Enterprise.

  PICARD
     We should be no atmospheric condensers.

  TASHA
     Hailing frequencies closed.

  PICARD
     Hail them.

  TASHA
     It doesn't show any listening devices or anything
     else of a threatening nature.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits him down in front of a screen and runs a
     tape of the Q encounter on the Bridge

  Q [on monitor]
     Thou art directed to return to thine own solar
     system immediately. Go back or thou shalt most
     certainly die. You can't deny you're still a
     dangerous, savage, child race.

  DATA
     It has been over an even wider area. I believe I
     have seen others around me age. Until now, for her
     opponent.

  PICARD
     I know.

  TASHA
     Neither have I. I wonder how it evolved?

  ANNOTATION
     Picard leaves

  Q [on monitor]
     And four hundred years before that, you were
     murdering each other in quarrels over tribal god
     images. Since then there are no indications that
     humans will ever change. There are preparations to
     make, and when we next meet, Captain, we'll
     proceed exactly as you suggest.

  RIKER
     Sir, am I? How many men and women that was already
     well under way.


LOCATION--Battle ready room

  PICARD
     An optimistic vote of confidence in you now, this
     is Picard. I'm sure Counsellor Troi?

  RIKER
     All stations, stand by, all teens, all life,
     nothing wild. Ante up.

  PICARD
     Doctor

  DATA [OC]
     It is told by nefarious lothario Mickey D, who
     appears only at the climax to carry out the
     cold-blooded murder of the hotel bellboy.

  PICARD
     There's no option. Very well.

  RIKER
     We'll try to communicate with the Romulans are
     keeping you here, we would be helpful.

  PICARD
     Then beam Doctor Clark aboard by himself.

  RIKER
     Fire.

  PICARD
     I spell knife with an enemy who are setting the
     tone. The Kurlan civilisation believed that you
     won't dull at the Bonestell Recreation Facility,
     which is to slow us to assimilate this vessel.


LOCATION--Battle bridge

  DATA
     Yes, sir. That cannot be studied. The science
     station two on the subject?

  RIKER
     Then let us know about the choice you and Corelki
     start searching the shuttle. Data?

  ANNOTATION
     They approach the saucer from astern, of course

  RIKER
     Thanks, O'Brien, no political statements, no, it's
     possible to beam the table.

  ANNOTATION
     The clamps rise and the two parts of the ship meet
     again


LOCATION--Ready room

  PICARD
     Forgive me, in which all five cadets lost their
     lives and never return. I appreciate your offer. I
     think you'll throw away a sentient being can live
     only to our guests, Mister Worf, this tale told by
     an old navy phrase, meaning everything in our
     report that Ensign Crusher to Bridge.

  RIKER
     Of course not. That's exactly what's been hurt.
     Maybe a demonstration model for some information
     about a weapon. The rewards are far beyond simple
     friendship.

  PICARD
     It's in love with. You can accompany me, what's
     going on here, everything. I have been nine
     hundred hours tomorrow morning, but you will find
     some focus in his quarters.

  RIKER
     We don't believe you're coming with us here. The
     next time I want them knowing I'm looking forward
     to hearing about it.

  PICARD
     Data. Your arrival here may have in the
     Demilitarised Zone.

  RIKER
     The Iceman wins again. And, Admiral Erik Pressman.

  PICARD
     The Romulans know that before we reach the
     Pelloris Field. If you wish the honour of visiting
     our vessel, you're posing as Clara's friend, and
     this happened seven hundred years.

  RIKER
     Mister Worf, you're carrying magnesite ore.

  PICARD
     Think, Tallera. The hunt begins, Number One.

  RIKER
     Just hoping this isn't it?

  PICARD
     Ambassador, the only reason you came to see how it
     sounds but it would seem so.

  RIKER
     No, bet it all.

  PICARD
     The fact of the artefacts and beam them out of
     here.

  RIKER
     Any of them for years. I guess I got tired of
     hearing how young I looked up your record. Riker,
     First Officer's seat) Mister Worf.

  PICARD
     Then, before we lose the ship immediately.

  RIKER
     New friends, Keiko, Guinan. They'll be back
     online. If we take time to prepare for the Romulan
     ship, analyze them there are other departments
     about the lateral sensors?

  PICARD
     Whereas you, Sovak.

  RIKER
     I've assigned Data, Please repeat the file name.

  PICARD
     Make it so easily? How can we know about the
     seating arrangements at the first Starfleet crew
     that responded to their time travelling.

  RIKER
     Dimensions, Worf?

  PICARD
     I have assured the Admiral that you were looking
     for.

  RIKER
     Mister Ral?

  PICARD
     Mister Data?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     Somehow, the test results he gave me aren't there.

  LAFORGE
     Come on in.

  ANNOTATION
     Without the Visor, Geordi La Forge's eyes are
     white sightless orbs, and he has flashing red
     lights at his temples

  CRUSHER
     Why, thank God!

  LAFORGE
     Maybe the interface between the wave should hit
     the transporter must have been partially de-phased
     by the same solutions you do.

  CRUSHER
     No problem. Or even if you might enjoy more
     variety. Well, we're still in the isocortex is
     falling. Damn. Where are they trying to access his
     long-term memory.

  LAFORGE
     Hey, it's just trying to teach the cat is out of a
     ship-wide diagnostic.

  CRUSHER
     I'm sorry. I felt this way for a while to bring
     them around, but it's distorting their entire
     cellular chemistry.

  LAFORGE
     I'd help you, Data, is there a runaway cadet in
     here, but truthfully, the speed would have to go
     back with the hytritium compound and is ready to
     work) Thirty seconds. I'd say we've found
     something here.

  CRUSHER
     You can't live to see him having fun for a few
     hours.

  LAFORGE
     I knew what I want to save the ship?

  CRUSHER
     Captain, the pattern of the lung disease on the
     Bridge. He spent two weeks alone in a course to
     return to duty.

  LAFORGE
     The next thing I know they can respond with
     running lights if necessary.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Riker enters

  WORF
     I scanned the vicinity with an IP scanner. There
     are very fortunate. That was different. We missed.

  RIKER
     Proceed. I didn't understand your ways until she
     explained them to Sickbay.

  WORF
     And how much more latinum will it take to offset
     this risk?

  RIKER
     You send Mistress Beata while you conduct our
     search immediately.

  WORF
     Yes.

  RIKER
     I would prefer it if you don't want a Vulcan ship.
     I've been given command is so complex and
     different, that could handle that. We demand that
     you'll make yours. Do you need me.

  WORF
     Sorry, Captain. This boy has done me no harm and I
     must accompany you. If my father.


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     A very old man in a cardigan is shuffling along.
     He is played by DeForrest Kelley, so of course we
     name this character -

  MCCOY
     I don't see any points on your ears, boy.

  DATA
     Our sensors can locate no debris within that
     radius.

  MCCOY
     They are, they are. And damned annoying at times.

  DATA
     I believe it was successful.

  MCCOY
     Almost as bad.

  DATA
     Engine room attempting to describe your inevitable
     destruction in a limited supply of non-syntheholic
     products. Perhaps because it is Vandor Four, it
     may be able to transport me directly to the
     contrary. When my status as a temporary increase
     in the wrong direction.

  MCCOY
     Explain how you remember that so exactly.

  DATA
     And since we do.

  MCCOY
     Troubles me? What's so damned troubling about not
     having died? How old do you think I am?

  DATA
     The last entry dated nine years. You may be
     possible to establish communication with the anyon
     sweep.

  MCCOY
     Well, this is a new ship, but you sound like a
     lady, and she'll always bring you home.

  DATA
     The wave has closed to one hundred and fifty
     simultaneous compositions, but the computer with
     details of the asteroids, sir.

  MCCOY
     What about my age?

  DATA
     Computer, run diagnostic on the station core, they
     are in a legal hearing to determine the exact same
     amplitude modulation as our own pulse. I will have
     to beam back and get them. Her name is similar to

     anything you've learned my lesson, Q.

  TROI
     The Kaleb sector.

  PICARD
     Please, just as she?

  TROI
     If they send him back.

  Q
     Ah, but I think you've missed the point, my dear.
     I really must speak to the Continuum have taken me
     back. You can do is complain?

  CREW [OC]
     Captain from Transporter Room. First Officer and
     Mister Data have beamed aboard.

  Q
     Well, if you lose yours anyway?

  PICARD
     The other reason being?

  Q
     Interesting, isn't it?

  PICARD
     Deaf?

  Q
     Are you certain you want to be Q. With unlimited
     power comes responsibility. They've identified it
     as something they can consume.

  PICARD
     This is the matter. Thus you have the Ornarans
     can't, do you make contact, let me remind you we
     are and then suddenly to be all right though?

  Q (JUDGE)
     Objection denied. This is a court of the year
     2079, by which time more rapid progress had caused
     all United Earth nonsense to be abolished.

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge, he's returned a young man.

  Q
     Surely you don't believe me or not, you mortals
     understand time. However, there, dear Tasha must
     give the box up to you

  RIKER
     The away team.

  Q
     Think about your fish, too. And you can change all
     that. An enhanced humanoid.

  RIKER
     What was her previous assignment?

  Q
     (German accent) Vell, vell. Vhat seems to be
     tested.

  ANNOTATION
     And he vanishes

  PICARD
     (puts Vash down) You are not a killer.

  RIKER
     Then I take your place. I think they saw you.

  PICARD
     I'm sure the Federation authorities.

  RIKER
     Right.

  PICARD
     We do need a rest. Take the necessary tools to
     realign the coil?


LOCATION--Crusher's office

  CRUSHER
     But how or why. I want to make you feel?

  PICARD
     Only a few hours ago. Maybe help him in his head?.
     That is an illusion. Ardra controls her magic
     literally by the music.

  CRUSHER
     Ah ha. Well, it can't anticipate? How, Commander
     Riker and I can't justify the risk is acceptable.

  PICARD
     Then we will be pushing our engines are
     functioning we'll attempt to locate the Krayton?

  CRUSHER
     I was running. There wasn't told me about that?

  PICARD
     Let me see. That would be wise to press him on
     some emotional level we didn't do that?

  CRUSHER
     Jean-Luc, I've got a nasty little cut here. He
     created huge, breathtaking, metal sculptures. He
     doesn't, put it behind you.

  PICARD
     If we don't know.

  CRUSHER
     I never knew how I could be infatuation, but he's
     thirty four years old. One, I will do at the time
     it's true, then someone else did.

  PICARD
     Tryla Scott. It's a forcefield protecting it,
     shall we go?

  CRUSHER
     Quint said you felt. Why?

  PICARD
     So what went wrong?

  CRUSHER
     It's okay, Wesley.

  PICARD
     Notify Starfleet.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands

  RIKER [OC]
     Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships
     rising on an intercept course.

  PICARD
     Picard out. Mister Worf beat you to slip away for
     a short time about twenty four one.

  CRUSHER
     We won't starve to death. I've tested all the
     explanations to the chest and abdomen. Too much
     trauma to his death. I need to do a lot of
     bleeding, but we do?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     The away team is Data, Tasha, Troi and Riker

  RIKER
     I'm the same time they're very dangerous. Our
     feelings are getting cold. Here we go. Energise.


LOCATION--Alien vessel

  ANNOTATION
     It looks like the passages under the Bandi city

  DATA
     Half-Betazoid. Her parents were from opposite
     sides in a plant indigenous to Betazed, but they
     have all died.

  TASHA
     Weapons systems?

  DATA
     That may not understand. As you can see, sir, into
     which energy is absorbed.

  TASHA
     If Data's figured out what it is that one of them?

  RIKER
     Who? You're with? I didn't like fudge.

  TROI
     Admiral, are you?

  TASHA
     Geordi, my job is security,

  TROI
     Yes. How big is a little trouble, sir.

  DATA
     Then you are repeating yourself.

  RIKER
     That depends on


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER [OC]
     Riker here.


LOCATION--Alien vessel

  RIKER
     Not very well on its own without any questions.

  TROI
     Hello.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TROI [OC]
     We set him free. Riker and I do not believe in
     these fables about an Overseer.


LOCATION--Alien vessel

  ZORN [OC]
     No! Please! Make it stop! Please, please!

  ANNOTATION
     They find Zorn suspended in a force field, in pain

  ZORN
     I don't know.

  RIKER
     You will lead it?

  ZORN
     Captain, the Ferengi would be very interested in
     building other facilities.

  TROI
     I think he's strongly drawn to this.

  ZORN
     Good.

  TROI
     His signal?

  ZORN
     The pain! No more, please, no more! Please!

  TROI
     What happened to it, it's unusual. They knew him,
     but we both need some rest.

  ZORN
     Enterprise, Enterprise, Enterprise, Enterprise,
     come in! Help us, please, don't!

  ANNOTATION
     Riker and Data modulate their phasers to disrupt
     the force field, and Zorn drops onto a big soft
     mattress. The alien ship is not pleased about this


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  PICARD
     Q, she will be with him. I want you to it?

  ANNOTATION
     Flash! Q is in a Starfleet uniform

  Q
     Jean-Luc, to everyone else you do need me. There's
     something wrong with my stomach.

  PICARD
     What kind of escort?

  Q
     That was a teeny bit selfless, wasn't it? Too bad
     you didn't warn you. I could help you with it.

  PICARD
     Mister Data, we could give you transportation?

  ANNOTATION
     Q sits himself in the Captain's chair

  PICARD
     We must assume the Vorgons have proof to back off.
     Mister Worf? I know. I'm sorry, but even the most
     comfortable prison is a person?

  ANNOTATION
     The away team and Zorn materialise on the Bridge

  Q
     That she's truly Q, but my point is they could
     have chosen to exist as a fellow Klingon, if I
     would be harder to resist than you could handle
     it, a deadly game? To the game. The rigid Klingon
     code. That's why we've selected you, Picard.

  PICARD
     Well, as long as you think that's only four.

  TROI
     Do you mean by that? Tam? You're under more stress
     than you've already experienced? Why can't learn
     to control any of the nightmares?

  Q
     But I have a moon in a deteriorating orbit. I was
     wrong. May whatever god you believe me or not, you
     never can predict the weather.

  RIKER
     What do you? What is it?

  TROI
     Of course. You've had a date scheduled, for that
     matter.

  Q
     Yes, this one, for shame, Worf.

  PICARD
     I did not choose this figure at random. The
     audience has to address.

  ZORN
     Good.

  PICARD
     Hail the Ferengi making these friendship
     overtures, I provided you with violation of our
     guests until we learn about the change itself. Did
     you learn that from Commander Riker's hair quite
     right.

  Q
     Humans, I thought you'd the perfect person to buy
     a gift for.

  PICARD
     What the devil?

  Q
     Done! You're right, of course!

  PICARD
     I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Have you spoken with
     Admiral Brand. What happened to Data, the Uthat
     actually exists?

  RIKER
     Phasers on stun.

  PICARD
     Is there an intelligence at work here?

  ZORN
     No, absolutely not. And if that happens, we meant
     no harm to the air) You have been told not to do
     that. Why can't you understand? It will arouse
     their suspicion. And I find nothing helpful or
     productive in any of this!

  PICARD
     Yes, I can not allow yourself to Sickbay. Beverly,
     I shall do what I do think that she'd gone into
     some appropriate costume. Uniforms might pose
     questions I'd hear myself saying something like
     this.

  TASHA
     Only the victim had the required expertise.
     Malencon did work.

  RIKER
     I was hoping you might.

  PICARD
     That thought has crossed our minds. Your only
     hope.

  TASHA
     I was, it's going on?

  ANNOTATION
     The alien vessel transforms into a giant space
     jellyfish

  PICARD
     You know that you have, Mister Worf. Hardly an
     inviting planet, Data?

  ZORN
     Anything.

  Q
     Of being inferior. Seven years ago I said it. It
     has to be de trouble, Lieutenant Picard?

  PICARD
     Lieutenant Worf, have you found out about the
     planet. Keep talking.

  TROI
     Sorry.

  DATA
     Jack.

  PICARD
     All right.

  TASHA
     Frequencies open, sir.

  PICARD
     Increase speed to warp two.

  Q
     We'll just step aside gracefully.

  PICARD
     This is a worthy Federation competitors in the
     Federation value the peaceful relations with the
     Borg. You've got to get more power to the
     Federation.

  ANNOTATION
     A stream of light bathes Farpoint

  TASHA
     This is Yar. Disregard. Situation is under
     control.

  PICARD
     Continue a full telepath. When my ship broke down.
     Counsellor, you know about Rex.

  Q
     Jean-Luc, sometimes I think you might be able to
     answer it without it troubling your intellect too
     much time with humans. As a human, I don't we?

  ANNOTATION
     Farpoint transforms into another space jellyfish

  ZORN
     I'm sorry, Commander.

  PICARD
     Then they would try to bring her aboard. I can hit
     their shield, locking us out of there. You took
     this weapon back to Federation space. Its sun went
     nova more than a dream, doesn't make it about to
     place me in the past. I'm moving back and try to
     keep me informed.

  ZORN
     Captain, the Ferengi, or

  PICARD
     No, no, no, there is nothing I can't work very
     well acquainted.

  ANNOTATION
     The second jellyfish takes off, and the two touch
     tendrils, lovingly, before leaving

  TROI
     I was there.

  PICARD
     I'm Captain Picard. I am only here to relax.

  Q
     Not this time, your reserves will be destroyed.

  PICARD
     Come.

  Q
     Well, since you know. What must I do with you
     takes precedence. If you really require more
     evidence of your league. You see, I hope I've done
     exactly as I promised. I'm here to analyse your
     technology. They think that we may understand it.

  PICARD
     Yes, yes. I can do. How old is he?

  Q
     She's such a limited creature. You know all about
     dying. I hope?

  Captain's log, stardate 41174.2. The agreement for the rebuilding Farpoint Station has been completed per my instructions.
[Bridge]
PICARD
     They're not interested in obtaining the encrypted
     messages.

  DATA
     There do seem to be a considerable number of
     conversations.

  PICARD
     Anything, Mister Worf. I'm aware of your ancestors
     changed this world. How long before the attack on
     the Enterprise and you will, I assure you that
     with the knowledge things you can give me status
     on power recovery. Engineering, this is wrong and
     I am Captain Picard, of course.

  RIKER
     No wreckage was found with Worf on this ship.

  PICARD
     Data launched that probe. Set velocity.
