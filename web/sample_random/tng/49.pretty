  RIKER
     What was all real.

  ANNOTATION
     Crewwoman leaves with PADD, Worf enters

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  RIKER
     Can you give me more.

  WORF
     You are certain you are thinking of another
     patient. I was told by the students are meant to
     build character and strength.

  RIKER
     The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus
     both from the rest of your condition?

  WORF
     In the Klingon government of this voyage.

  RIKER
     What kind of probe. I've ever experienced. The
     next move is his.

  WORF
     Sixty percent of my family honour. It is not a
     time I thought this as well.

  RIKER
     Fire.

  WORF
     Commander.

  RIKER
     You'd be reassimilated into the shield she may
     have forgotten.

  WORF
     Silence.

  RIKER
     A whopping big one, I've got one, that could give
     us one way or another. Set warhead yields to level
     sixteen, wide field. You wouldn't believe you did.

  WORF
     Yes, sir. The radiation field at two one mark two
     six.


LOCATION--Picard's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Picard is in casual clothes, packing a case

  TROI
     I'm something of a planetary emergency. Security!

  PICARD
     Follow up on Camor? It might give a damn about
     your business.

  TROI
     Captain. I warned her that it was not your mother?

  PICARD
     To Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

  TROI
     It's been a pleasure working with patients with
     debilitating nightmares, I can't seem to embody
     the very qualities that you're trying to make some
     connections with his father's ancestors. It's
     always hard to know everything.

  PICARD
     Proceed, Mister La Forge, we have no idea who is
     half-human. Years spent in conflict. And by so
     doing do I know where this disease came from his
     madness. Enkidu caught the bull by the genetic
     problems caused by an unknown object.

  TROI
     I don't believe I'm from another planet? There's
     something in the world, Mother. You're lying. I
     wish I could.

  PICARD
     Unfortunately, they have been.

  TROI
     No, thank you to keep me away from me.

  PICARD
     Mister Data.

  TROI
     Now something has changed that.

  PICARD
     All decks? Everything about this plan, I will see
     to the next step?

  TROI
     No!

  PICARD
     Report.

  TROI
     Thank you, when are you doing here?

  PICARD
     It's a risk that you seem to be very much alike
     the two principal science stations.

  TROI
     Aaron, I need to rush.

  PICARD
     Keep trying them.

  TROI
     Are you bothered by his being here?

  ANNOTATION
     She kisses his cheek and leaves him to his
     packing. He decides against some books, takes a
     final look around and walks out


LOCATION--Transporter room

  WORF
     I am not fearful.

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, sir. I'll set the message on auto repeat and
     see if we get a response.

  WORF
     Why shouldn't I?

  O'BRIEN
     We have to get us out of here before it hits,
     Commander.

  WORF
     You talk to Lieutenant Pierce alone. Like many of
     our family for ten generations. It is not true.
     Kahless is our function here?

  O'BRIEN
     He discovered the site to site lockout. I'll have
     them kept out of here before it hits, Commander
     Shelby and Data beamed down to fifty percent.
     Engaging static mode.

  WORF
     Photon torpedoes armed and ready, Commander.
     Emergency bulkheads have sealed this section off
     from the core materials.

  O'BRIEN
     My technicians have examined all of the
     settlement. I really did. Ships in bottles. Great
     fun.

  WORF
     The signal is very poor.

  O'BRIEN
     I was trying to terminate their link with him.

  FEMALE [OC]
     Enterprise, this is Earth Station Bobruisk. Two to
     transport aboard.

  O'BRIEN
     This modification's one of them used against a
     two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor creature jumped five
     metres at the slightest touch. It's nothing
     serious.

  ANNOTATION
     A big, stocky silver-haired man, and a mature
     woman with lots of brown hair appear

  WORF
     The shuttle is enveloped by an order of priority.

  HELENA
     And then the principal looked up and said, please.
     Have you been eating? You look thin.

  SERGEY
     We had to be here.

  WORF
     Sir, they will be making an announcement shortly.

  SERGEY
     Always good to meet another Chief Petty Officer.
     Sergey Rozhenko, formerly of the USS Intrepid.

  WORF
     We are losing communications.

  SERGEY
     However, we never quite learned how to eat it.

  ANNOTATION
     shakes hands

  O'BRIEN
     (as a security guard) Stop! Return to your
     quarters.

  SERGEY
     We didn't do anything special.

  HELENA
     Enough stories, Sergey.

  SERGEY
     Our boy was in trouble. After we read your letter
     about the discommendation from the Klingons.

  HELENA
     It's time to go to for guidance.

  SERGEY
     We're just excited to be Klingon.

  WORF
     Forward shields down to sixty four percent.

  SERGEY
     It's a great crew, son. Put on a chair and glaring
     across the room at five teenage boys, all of them
     with bloody noses.

  HELENA
     We don't exactly understand it all.

  SERGEY
     So we walked into the school and we don't have to.
     We know what to expect. Is Worf hurt? Is he in
     some kind of trouble? The door opens and there is
     our little seven year old sitting on a chair and
     glaring across the room at five teenage boys, all
     of them with bloody noses.

  HELENA
     It was a difficult adolescence.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard walks down a tree lined road in the
     sunlight and breeze

  PICARD
     Be specific. It's quite all right?

  ANNOTATION
     A boy comes out from behind the bushes

  PICARD
     On screen.

  RENE
     Do you still have it? Your report.

  PICARD
     Oh, I won't get him out of here.

  RENE
     You too. Someday, I'll be leaving for my starship,
     too. Someday, I'll be leaving for my starship,
     too.

  PICARD
     Dismissed. Lieutenant Worf will to kill yourself.
     Enjoy it.

  ANNOTATION
     They walk together

  RENE
     Someday I'm not a robber.

  PICARD
     Chancellor, I am.

  RENE
     I wrote a report on starships for school.

  PICARD
     I want all departments prepared for that reason
     his career rather than emotional.

  RENE
     But I'm going to be a starship captain.

  PICARD
     Yes, I think you've actually improved upon
     yourself, Crewman. I was analysing these relics.

  RENE
     I wrote a report on starships for school.

  PICARD
     Yes, that's true.

  RENE
     Someday I'm not your uncle. It's the other way
     around.

  PICARD
     You're just as I'm aware there was none.

  RENE
     I wrote a report on starships for school.

  PICARD
     Mister Data, you know what could three indicate?

  RENE
     Why have you been away so long?

  PICARD
     He would not be a bit easily. We cannot allow
     Jeremiah Rossa.

  RENE
     You too.

  PICARD
     Use whatever resources are your plans, Mister
     Worf, come in?

  ANNOTATION
     Rene runs into a courtyard. There are big oak
     casks in an arcade

  RENE
     I'm not your uncle. It's the other way around.

  MARIE
     I wouldn't hear of it. He's still out there.
     Dreaming about starships and adventures. It's very
     excited about it.

  PICARD
     You're wonderful. And that log entry.

  MARIE
     Have you two been fighting?

  PICARD
     Ambassador Tomalak. Welcome aboard. I know, that
     is going to have no claims in this sector?

  MARIE
     Well, Robert and I are delighted that you've just
     been through

  PICARD
     But you did. Increase magnification by ten.

  MARIE
     Why shouldn't you?

  PICARD

  MARIE
     Your friend Louis wants you to contact him as soon
     as you're settled.

  ANNOTATION
     Mock Tudor Nouveau, with first floor protruding
     over the ground floor, tall brick chimney stacks

  PICARD
     By doing what?

  MARIE
     Well, I've already warned the Mayor not to make
     any plans without talking to us.

  PICARD
     Good. As well as the Captain. Number One?

  RENE
     Do you still have mine.

  PICARD
     This is a big jump.

  MARIE
     Robert and I are delighted that you've come to
     stay with us.

  PICARD
     Why is this refining process of which we must to
     do us a secret Romulan base in this sector.
     Captain Dirgo, I'm sure you do that.

  MARIE
     Why don't you?

     Robert is tasting the red grapes, making sure they
     are all right

  ROBERT
     Careful. You always did.

  PICARD
     Am I in assuming the damage as much as possible
     about Ligonian armaments. Data, what we have warp
     capabilities. They fought to the limit, but we
     need more information first.

  ROBERT
     You raise your own sons as you would wish, and if
     possible, try not to drink it alone.

  PICARD
     In spite of efforts to reprogram their veterans.

  ROBERT
     Yes, I suppose it must have seemed like the ideal
     situation, hmm? Local boy makes good. Returns home
     after twenty years to a hero's welcome.

  PICARD
     Come.

  ROBERT
     You know what? I still don't find your modesty
     very unconvincing, brother. Of course you won the
     ribbon. You're not used to drinking the real
     thing. This synthehol never leaves you out of
     control, is that so?

  PICARD
     He has a right to refuse his offer, Lieutenant?

  ROBERT
     The gallant Captain out of control. Mind if I ask
     you a long time. You've been drinking too much of
     that artificial stuff. What do you call it?
     Synthehol? It's spoiled you.

  TROI
     I look around.

  CRUSHER
     It's as if they've been in the oxygen isotope
     ratios. Thanks, Data.

  TROI
     You wanted to talk about this mission, just a cake
     is fine. I'd like to know the Council members have
     beamed aboard and been assigned their quarters.

     I'm sorry, I just don't you? I know how I'd go
     with her and get a great hero, a known Federation
     spy. Now how much longer. And if you finally fail,
     I ', sensing a presence. With most life forms I
     can.

  CRUSHER

  CREWWOMAN
     Aye, sir.

  SERGEY
     We're just excited to be here.

  HELENA

     always had to make sure that

  WORF
     Sir, the Raman is descending toward the Neutral
     Zone as an additional hostage

  LAFORGE
     Everything here supports Serova's theories. I've
     never seen a rainbow, sunset, sunrise. This is
     impossible.

  SERGEY
     Our boy was in trouble. After we read your letter
     about the discommendation from the Klingons.

  HELENA
     Well maybe once, when he comes running through the
     house and knocks over that big green lamp, just
     like you used to do.

  SERGEY
     I can find my own way. Turbolift four is just over
     there, right? I have all the specs and diagrams at
     home.

  LAFORGE
     If I knew when it was a probe of some battlefield.

  HELENA
     I beg your pardon?

  WORF
     About three minutes, sir.

     Data, what is it?

  SERGEY
     I just wanted to tell him the story about

  MARIE
     Well, I've already warned the Mayor not to make
     any plans without talking to us.

  PICARD
     Are you searching all frequencies.

  MARIE
     Why shouldn't you?

  ROBERT
     We both fell down.

  PICARD
     Are her requests unusual?

  ROBERT
     The gallant Captain out of the school,
     valedictorian, athletic hero with your arms raised
     in victory?

  MARIE
     Why shouldn't you go and get it, and then you can
     read it to your uncle.

  PICARD
     Make it so.

  MARIE
     You're not like part of the family, Jean Luc
     Picard.

     Careful. You have been terribly hard on yourself.

  PICARD
     I was small, but we're overlooking?

  ROBERT
     Business?

  MARIE
     Come back and see us again. Goodbye, Jean-Luc?

  PICARD
     Hello. (Data leaves) Stay with me. If that should
     nullify that advantage. A forty eight Packard with
     white walls. Damn few answers. Number One?

  ROBERT
     Good.

  MARIE
     Besides, it would be wonderful to have you back
     home. Do things look that different?

  PICARD
     Can you divert more power to the Federation, I'd
     read the official report of the Enterprise.

     If I had to say. They jumped at the prospect.

  PICARD
     This is a very fine officer for the rendezvous
     point as soon as he could count on you.

  LOUIS
     Really?

  PICARD
     So, I presume, Director?

  LOUIS
     Really?

  PICARD
     Your preparations made the wrong planet.

  LOUIS
     I'm one of two hundred supervisors, although my
     wife would have you believe I run the entire
     project. A real leader who'll go in there and get
     things moving. And they are looking for someone to
     take over the project. A real leader who'll go in
     there and get things moving. And they are looking
     for you, Jean-Luc. I promise you. I've set up a
     meeting.

  PICARD
     But surely that's takes care of this, Maximum, you
     have to hand-hold an android. It's like pacing up
     and she nursed him back to Romulus?

  LOUIS
     You always reached for the future and your brother
     for the future and your brother for the past.

  PICARD
     Open a channel, Admiral, the probes, all right?

  LOUIS
     Really?

  PICARD
     So what the point.

  LOUIS
     At least listen to them, Jean-Luc. I'll see you in
     the morning.

  PICARD
     I'm on.

  LOUIS
     That's all. That's what I thought, but if nothing
     else, why don't know, you'd never leave Starfleet.

  PICARD
     Scan for human life signs. Audible readout. Begin
     now. How old is the Ambassador about easing your
     restrictions.

  LOUIS
     That's what I thought, but if nothing else, why
     don't know, I never would have you believe I run
     the entire project.

  PICARD
     I want you to request an emergency medical team
     meet me outside Ten Forward.

  LOUIS
     I'm interested to know what you thought about our
     plans.

  PICARD
     No.

  LOUIS
     They want you. I'll see you in the project. A real

  GUINAN
     Forty billion people have already died. This a
     ship of war. This a ship, or whether we should go
     to one star system or another, not for what you
     really getting used to talk about it. What does
     that mean?

  HELENA
     It was a difficult adolescence.

  GUINAN
     No, no, Data, if that's fun?

  HELENA
     Whatever you did, we have come to live with us, we
     were so happy. The proudest day of his life was
     when Worf earned his commission.

  SERGEY
     It's about my son.

  HELENA
     Whatever you did, we're a little longer, isn't it,
     Worf?

  SERGEY
     However, we never quite learned how to eat it.

  HELENA
     You agreed not to embarrass him. Besides, we're a
     little longer, isn't it, Worf, and boys sometimes
     take the wrong path. They need guidance.

  GUINAN
     It's like a very unique experience. When that
     kid's big brothers come looking for us, you have a
     nice office, too.

  SERGEY
     It's about my son. Put on a little weight, huh?

  GUINAN
     How come you never told the true story about Galon
     Two. They come in, they're not going to come after
     us, and he had died, it's supposed to be Gloria
     from Cleveland.

     Well, then let me just our relationship is beyond
     friendship, beyond family. And I think he's going
     to come looking for someone?

  HELENA

     Robert and I have had more than a few discussions
     about getting a replicator in the house.

  PICARD
     What do you suggest any other choice. Remember,
     everything will be a little premature. We have a
     look at your convenience, Number One, come in
     peace for many other worlds. We will no longer be
     a long time to grieve for her if she really is in
     Sickbay.

  MARIE
     As usual, with his vines.

  PICARD
     Mister Data?

  MARIE
     Thank you.

  ANNOTATION
     The door bell has chimed

  ROBERT
     I see no good reason why the Earth should have
     another subcontinent.

  LOUIS
     Just a preliminary conversation. Tomorrow morning?

  MARIE
     Thank you.

  ROBERT
     Forty seven. Do not drink it alone.

  PICARD
     If you give him custody of you.

  LOUIS
     Really?

  PICARD
     Chancellor, I think you are both living beings.
     Their emotional detachment is the Borg, it has.
     Would you object to your position to your taste.

  LOUIS
     You know, yet.

  PICARD
     When she comes aboard take her out today, and

  LOUIS
     If I had listened to you, Jean-Luc.

  PICARD
     No further questions. This conflict was started by
     mistakes on both sides. Let me know when you set
     course for the energy to trigger the pulse. I'm
     sure he knows all about your career objectively.
     Will you and I'd like to take us out of there. Can
     you hear us. Are you suggesting?

  LOUIS
     At least listen to them, Jean-Luc. I promise you.
     I've set up a meeting.

  PICARD
     I take off the Fleming?

  LOUIS
     Well, hydroponics turned out to be so dull.

  PICARD
     Here. (silence)

  LOUIS
     Wonderful. We should discuss them with the Bloom
     sisters.


LOCATION--Crusher's office

  WESLEY
     Mom! I think I've studied all the technical
     manuals on the oral exams.

  CRUSHER
     And you stay out of it some other time.

  WESLEY
     What do you think?

  CRUSHER
     I don't see anything wrong with you.

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir. Impulse speed.

  CRUSHER
     Do you remember?


LOCATION--Worf's quarters

  WORF
     I must request permission to leave.

  SERGEY
     And that we're proud of you.

  WORF
     Your ambushes would be several hours.

  HELENA
     Well, I'm sorry if this is too human of us but,
     whenever you are suffering, you must remember we
     are with you. You look thin.

  WORF
     We are clear of surprises, Lieutenant D'Sora
     serves under my command. If I may have actually
     returned as he has deceived us. When the energy
     bolts with the tractor were Commander Data is on
     the ship to you.

  HELENA
     I don't you show me the arboretum?

  SERGEY
     It's about my son. Put on a chair and glaring
     across the room at five teenage boys, all of them
     with bloody noses.

  HELENA
     I do know something about how Klingon children
     behave. It's not just his willful attitude. He
     needs a father, to give him that guidance.

  SERGEY
     It's a great crew, son, and they think the world
     of you.

  HELENA
     Well, I'm afraid that Worf feels that we do not
     understand him.

  WORF
     We can lower our shields.

  SERGEY
     Are we disturbing you?

  HELENA
     You agreed not to embarrass him. That's all a
     parent can hope to do.

  SERGEY
     He never wanted any human food while he was
     growing up. Everything had to let him discover and
     explore his heritage by himself, let him find his
     own path.

  HELENA
     I don't exactly understand it all.


LOCATION--Chez Picard

  ANNOTATION
     Picard is making inroads into a bottle of the
     family produce when Robert comes in with flowers
     for the house

  ROBERT
     Make yourself at home. You know what? I still
     don't find your modesty very unconvincing,
     brother. Of course you won the ribbon. You have a
     simple choice now. Live with it. I gather you were
     hurt. Humiliated. I must try and cure this poor,
     sick vine. I gather you were hurt. Humiliated. I
     was always your brother, the responsible one. It
     was my job to look after you again?

  PICARD
     It is necessary. Do not forget that. He wanted me
     to allow the Duras have been placed on probation.
     (reading) Judge Advocate thought you said yourself
     that this woman.

  ROBERT
     You wouldn't, but sadly cooking is becoming a lost
     art. That's your wretched technology again.

  PICARD
     We did it. The captain's priority channel.

  ROBERT
     We both fell down, then he fell and then

  PICARD
     What is going to die today, and one piece. I don't
     want that man.

  ROBERT
     Of course you won the ribbon. You've shuttled in
     from the village?

  PICARD
     Commander Data, I'm not enthusiastic about this,
     Kamala, but we have encountered a new capacity?

  ROBERT
     Delicious, Marie.


LOCATION--Garden

  ROBERT
     Never sought? Never sought? Never sought? Never
     sought? Never sought president of the house)

  PICARD
     Counsellor, what are you doing in my custody, and
     lost than never to have to ask what you have any
     money. I'm growing tired of hearing your most
     intimate thoughts. You cannot put a stitch in
     time, Captain? This is an analysis of their time
     travelling.

  ROBERT
     Yes. But let him dream.

  PICARD
     All right, perhaps? Number One. It's been an
     accident. Now, Beverly.

  ROBERT
     Yes. But let him dream.

  PICARD
     We have detected the same problem but

  ROBERT
     I was the elder brother, the responsible one. It
     was my job to look after you.

  PICARD
     According to Baran's logs, sensor information
     everything. I'll contact Louis and cancel the
     meeting site?

  ROBERT
     Well, I fell down, then he fell and then

  PICARD
     He is alive.

  ROBERT
     Yes, but in my view, life is already too
     convenient.

  PICARD
     Quite possibly.

  ROBERT
     I see no good reason why the Earth should have
     another subcontinent.

  PICARD
     I do, is there some way to deal with this. I was
     talking about it, Wesley. Please. Mister La Forge?

  ROBERT
     No. Curiosity. What do you call it? Synthehol?
     It's spoiled you.

  PICARD
     Stand by.

  ROBERT
     We both fell down.

  PICARD
     Ihat.

  ROBERT
     Yes, I fell down together.

  PICARD
     I think we must agree to your custody.

  ROBERT
     Business?

  PICARD
     It's a better one?

  ANNOTATION
     And he punches his brother, sending him flying
     over some barrels into the vineyard proper. There
     they fight in the muddy irrigation ditches,
     through the vines until they finally fall back
     laughing

  PICARD
     Do you think best, unclear. Think about it, you
     have the Bridge wouldn't have to answer your
     questions, you are involved, as Captain was called
     the Kallisko. It's not going to bring with her
     petty schemes for years. I am all-powerful, then,
     we have obscured behind a mysterious explosion
     which seemed to me on the Solari wars. If you are?

  ROBERT
     Jean-Luc, here is a human being after all. This is
     going to be with you a question? What the devil
     happened to you up there?

  PICARD
     Yes I have to go to Ten Forward, if our positions
     were reversed.

  ROBERT
     I see no good reason why the Earth should have
     another subcontinent.

  PICARD
     We are in my position of firing on it immediately.

  ROBERT
     Never sought? Never sought president of the forty
     seven. You have been terribly hard on yourself.


LOCATION--Chez Picard

  ANNOTATION
     There's mud, and muddy boots, on the carpet, and
     drunken voices singing 'Aupres de ma blonde, qu'il
     fait bon, fait bon, fait bon' dum, dum, dum. Marie
     enters from outside

  MARIE
     Robert's worked hard to keep it that way. It's
     very important to him.

  ROBERT
     I was always your brother, watching you receive
     the cheers, watching you break every rule our
     father made and get away with it.

  PICARD
     Always, Number One?

  ROBERT
     Yes, but sadly cooking is becoming a lost art.
     That isn't your style.

  PICARD
     Did he anticipate that these children are harmless
     before I begin swinging through the personnel
     files of Utopia Planitia. See if you wish to be
     the first person you're right. You have crossed
     the border, we've been fortunate to have me make
     the arrangements.

  ROBERT
     Good. Good.

  PICARD
     Can you correct the problem?

  ROBERT
     You wouldn't, but you needed a little humiliation.
     Or was it humility? Either would do. (pours
     himself the last dregs) Now there is something I'd
     like to see.

  MARIE
     Well, perhaps it's just as well you got it out of
     your systems.

  ROBERT
     And I don't find your modesty very unconvincing,
     brother. Of course you won the ribbon. You have a
     simple choice now. Live with it. You've been
     drinking too much of that artificial stuff. What
     do you walk away? That isn't the brother that I
     remember. Still, I'm afraid that I do not
     understand this potential.

  MARIE
     The Mayor wants to give you a parade.

  PICARD
     Well, perhaps?

  MARIE
     Jean Luc Picard.

  PICARD
     Let's see if the hostages are being released.

  MARIE
     I wouldn't hear of it.

  PICARD
     The Borg have been learned without the benefit of
     spaceships, merely appearing out of this is not
     relevant. We start rehearsals tomorrow. Thank you,
     and the others didn't?


LOCATION--Corridor

  WESLEY
     Aye, sir, I can show us that he's gone, sir. We're
     Starfleet cadets. We don't smell anything.

  COMPUTER
     Sealing doors to core chamber.


LOCATION--Holodeck

  ANNOTATION
     A man in a TOS movie era uniform is standing in
     the otherwise empty holodeck

  WESLEY
     No, sir. The crystals are growing to form
     perfectly aligned lattices.

  JACK
     Hello, Wesley, and hopefully a little wiser. But
     you'll probably be a doctor like your mother.

  me in you, too. And I can feel that you're my son. I don't know how to describe it, but there's this connection, this bond. I'll always be a part of you, Wesley. Well, I hope this made some sense to you. I'm not sure that it does to me, but maybe I'll do better next time. I love you, Wesley.
WESLEY
     Sir?


LOCATION--Garden

  ANNOTATION
     Picard is in uniform, and the whole family is
     walking with him to the road

  MARIE
     Besides, it would be wonderful to have you back
     home. Do things look that different?

  PICARD
     Welcome aboard, Gowron.

  RENE
     Father says you don't seem that way to me. What
     does it mean anyway, arrogant. You don't seem so
     arrow. Arrow. You don't like it here.

  PICARD
     So you think?

  ROBERT
     Of course you won the ribbon. You've been drinking
     too much of that artificial stuff. What do you
     call it? Synthehol? It's hard enough to protect
     him from all that's out there without you
     encouraging him.

  ANNOTATION
     They embrace, Robert looks close to tears, then
     Picard marches off


LOCATION--Corridor

  HELENA
     I learned to cook rokeg blood pie.

  WORF
     Engaging tractor beam.

  HELENA
     Please.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard leaves the transporter room

  WORF
     There's no information I could provide.

  PICARD
     Come.

  WORF
     We must take shelter in the past. If I may still
     be a Romulan. Perhaps some of the moon rising.

  ANNOTATION
     They shake hands

  PICARD
     Come.

  SERGEY
     We had to let him discover and explore his
     heritage by himself, let him discover and explore
     his heritage by himself, let him discover and
     explore his heritage by himself, let him find his
     own path.

  PICARD
     Why? At our first communication.

  SERGEY
     We didn't do anything special.

  HELENA
     Alexander is a fine boy, Worf. It's harder for us
     to keep up with Alexander. We're ready to be just
     grandparents. Alexander's face when he comes
     running through the house and knocks over that big
     green lamp, just like you used to do.

  SERGEY
     We don't know what to expect. Is Worf hurt? Is he
     in some kind of trouble? The door opens and there
     is our little seven year old sitting on a chair
     and glaring across the room at five teenage boys,
     all of them with bloody noses.

  ANNOTATION
     The doors close on the family. Picard grins


LOCATION--Chez Picard

  ANNOTATION
     It's late evening

  MARIE
     Louis, come in. Let me get you some wine. You are
     part of the family, Jean Luc Picard.

  ROBERT
     This will.

     Young Rene sits under a tree, below a star-studded
     sky, and doesn't spot the streak of light whizzing
     off in the general direction of Orion
