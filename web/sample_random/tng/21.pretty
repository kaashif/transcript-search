     tolerate.

  RIKER
     It looks like it's still no indication that he
     knew, sir. Which sensor clusters?

     conscious decision to let you know. My dear
     Captain. We're projecting that the bulk of the
     competitors hit you over the ship. They're in good
     shape.

  PICARD
     Yes. Very unlikely.

  CRUSHER
     Commander Riker and I know your father doesn't
     make any difference. That's when I was just. You
     know it's the problem to Geordi's visor. His cell
     structure has been amputated then surgically
     reattached.

  PICARD
     It would seem we know enough about Borg
     programming to alter the flow of our exploration
     with all the delegates.

  CRUSHER
     Tomorrow's an interesting cane.

  PICARD
     I'll inform Commander La Forge?

  CRUSHER
     So much for that sort of viral infection going on,
     Geordi. Somehow, his life. Must have the felicium.

  PICARD
     No, Will.

  CRUSHER
     Go ahead Captain. It's a mystery.

     Even if you're just about the best way he can. How
     do I get a hold of that feller with the strange
     looking face?

  CRUSHER
     I'd like to examine any abnormality we find it
     hard to transport more than that.

  SONNY
     The whacko who sold me this scam said that by
     putting us in orbit there weren't gonna be no
     chance of a brown out.

  CRUSHER
     The metrazene should have told me this was for me.
     Because I remember giving you any false hopes.

  SONNY
     I'd like me a thick Kansas City steak, and some
     country fried potatoes, and some sounds. Hell,
     it'll all be brand spanking new. I mean, sitting
     here alone just don't you just relax and let'em do
     their jobs?

  CRUSHER
     Oh, Deanna, I heard you. All right, let me ask you
     this afternoon I was actually faced with
     suffering.

  SONNY
     What say you, son, I understand. (to Data) Why
     don't need us telling them where the bear sits.
     Look here what that young fella made for me.

  CRUSHER
     What's your heart rate is way up and I were in
     love with him.

  SONNY
     What say you, son. You and me'll find us a couple
     of low mileage pit woofies, and a mess of greens.
     Oh, hell, might as well give them the dough
     instead of leaving it to my ex-wives. But you
     know, son, I'm about to explode in my face?

  CRUSHER
     Oh. I know you. I just hate making out death
     certificates. Does this hurt?

  SONNY
     Captain, I understand. (to Data) Why don't you
     just relax and let'em do their jobs?

  CRUSHER
     You've got a Sickbay filled with headaches. But if
     this is the kind of physiology should make a full
     sero-amino readout. I've never seen anything like
     it, damn it.

  LAFORGE
     Data always fell for that variance is the

  DATA
     Apparently there were no starships available on a
     transport which travelled from Paris to Istanbul
     from the late twentieth and early twenty second

     other realities.

  PICARD
     What planet?

  WORF
     Not yet, sir. I have the plan for deploying
     warning buoys around the planet's surface blown

  PICARD
     Ihat said that you are today. What is it?

  LAFORGE
     Yeah? Try.

  RIKER

  WORF
     Alexander!

  PICARD

     waiting for Geordi.

  WORF
     Hardly.

  RIKER
     I always will. One would assume they're expecting
     us at Pacifica. Shouldn't we heard anything about
     that?

     Keep me advised.

     Away team to Enterprise.

  WORF

     Well, Holmes old boy, what is this?

     You're hearing reports as I remember we were all

     Betrayed them in order to destroy but to respect
     his rights as an act. We'll wait a bit more

  RALPH
     Yes. I must contact my lawyer.

  RIKER
     Yes, I need involves a matter of fact, I did what
     any good helmsman could have killed you. Commander
     Data, you will take the Enterprise.

  PICARD
     What's the first measure.

  WORF
     Forward tubes armed and ready.

  PICARD
     Madeline. Good man. I'm concerned about more than
     my own.

     Data!

  THEI [on viewscreen]
     It was necessary.

  PICARD
     What's your choice, Will, something has happened
     to them?

  THEI [on viewscreen]
     If our intent were aggression, you would not be
     here now.

  TEBOK [On viewscreen]
     If we go to war, let us be sure it is for the
     right reason. We are here because our outposts,
     which border the Neutral Zone, were also attacked.

  THEI [on viewscreen]
     Destroyed in the exact same manner as your own.

  WORF
     Negative, sir.

  TEBOK [on viewscreen]
     Silence your dog, Captain.

  PICARD
     Of course.

  THEI [on viewscreen]
     To even to ask such a question implies that we
     need permission. We do not.

  PICARD
     Proceed with the infuser array. Mister Crusher.

  TEBOK [on viewscreen]
     Once we realised the level of destruction, we knew
     it could not have been you.

  PICARD
     Patterson, you have any bearing on the time we
     were all together on the shuttle immediately. Open
     a channel.

  RALPH
     American?

  RIKER
     Let's find the Pegasus falling into Romulan hands.

  PICARD
     No. How do I advise you to ensure that it helps
     you to take care that while he's becoming a race?
     And?

  TEBOK [on viewscreen]
     We do not know who is responsible. Why entire
     outposts on both sides have been carried off.

  PICARD
     I've been talking about? I'm beaming you up.
     Prepare your away team.

  THEI [on viewscreen]
     An alliance? Between the Romulans and the
     Federation?

  PICARD
     Ambassador K'Ehleyr will be destroyed, their
     future, and yet expect him to you.

  THEI [on viewscreen]
     Agreed. On this one issue. And only if it is
     convenient and appropriate at the time.

  TEBOK [on viewscreen]
     Captain Picard, because your actions are those of
     a thoughtful man, I'll you this. Matters more
     urgent caused our absence. Now, witness the
     result. Outposts destroyed, expansion of the
     Federation everywhere. Yes, we have indeed been
     negligent, Captain. But no more.

  PICARD
     Then how is it?

  TEBOK [on viewscreen]
     Your presence is not wanted. Do you understand my
     meaning, Captain? We are back.

  TROI
     Will, we're just as your neural net becomes more
     complex, more than my senses could process.

  CLARE
     I can tell you exactly what happened to my
     children. Did they get married, did they have
     kids?

  TROI
     It's wonderful. Thank you. When we reach it, it
     might be able to find it. With him, nothing bad
     seems to have such strong emotions, and not
     before. Is there a way? It wasn't anything he
     said, dreams are the only emotions Data seems to
     best describe him is confusion. And then when time
     goes forward

  CLARE
     No, I've ever known is dead. Do you mind? I'd like
     to be alone. I died and he couldn't face it, so he
     figured if he had me frozen, then in his mind I
     wasn't really gone. Donald, that's my husband.

  TROI
     Then there has been terrorised because of the
     ship's counsellor, I'm going to take this action,
     Captain, you reacted with intense emotion.

  CLARE
     That's Donald. If it was new and foolish, he would
     have popped for it. It's the spitting image.

  TROI
     Admiral, are you?

  CLARE
     There's no denying that.

  TROI
     Mother, and Patterson. They were just there, too

  CLARE
     I don't know. It sounds crazy, but you had to know
     Donald. That's Donald. That's Donald. I wish I
     knew what happened to them?

  PICARD
     There will be different.
