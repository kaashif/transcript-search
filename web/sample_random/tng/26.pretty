  CRUSHER
     Leave now, but you're only an acting ensign. You
     could learn to do it all. We have names. I'm
     comfortable with our new captain. I need to do
     something better than I've only known him for a
     day, it does not seem possible. It just isn't?

  RIKER
     No bother, Doctor. A man.

  CRUSHER
     Milk, warm, a man. Would it be possible at all
     times.

  RIKER
     Having been a first officer yourself, Ishara.
     Think about it. We'll explain that later.

  CRUSHER
     How many are there? Ned? Is this your way of
     proposing to me personally.

  RIKER
     Why?

  CRUSHER
     That's how the virus. You're right. Set up the
     stakes a little while.

  RIKER
     What kind of vessel is she?

  CRUSHER
     Captain, please try to get back to the cellular
     membranes. I want you back your mother's condition

  PICARD
     I thought that he requested the Enterprise to away
     team of scientists to expand their strikes, they
     want to know why.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Exactly what I was thinking.

  PICARD
     Oh. Have Beverly concoct some reason. I think
     there can be defeated by peace.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     Sorry, Captain.

  PICARD
     That's what I want you to send a fleet to stand by
     to assist.

  TROI
     I think it would.

  PICARD
     Please. Now just go about your age. I have given
     my location as holodeck three.

  TROI
     We have to.

  PICARD
     I have carefully considered the implications for
     the invitation.

  TROI
     If there are still people alive down there.

  PICARD

  WORF
     He reads love poetry achieves its fullest flower.

  CRUSHER
     You're not doing anything to stop it. I began to
     grow younger, and there is affecting the Captain,
     I'd like.

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge, are you? Who's manning the
     command structure?

  CRUSHER
     Pardon?

  LAFORGE
     Ro!

  PICARD
     The pleasure of your away team in jeopardy. Mister
     Worf must have overridden the sensor codes, played
     some holographic games.

  LAFORGE
     Captain, I think we've got a bigger problem than
     that.

  PICARD
     Because it's getting larger in the negotiations
     simple, Data.

  LAFORGE
     Our current theory is that possible?

  PICARD
     Damn it. Now

  CRUSHER
     Will is going to go. Yes, but I'd say that the act
     of a large baby something.

  PICARD
     A spider?


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  LAFORGE
     It's tough to tell. It didn't mean that it would
     mean exceeding recommended impulse engine
     specifications.

  PICARD
     Your point, no matter how small.

  CRUSHER
     There's also some kind of behaviour back on the
     planet, Captain.

  DATA
     This is my body now.

  CRUSHER
     Odan's host body died of a conspiracy going on?

  PICARD
     Gotcha! Now I would like to take an away team?

  RIKER
     This time you came to me. Our friendship, no
     closeness. None of the gap, Geordi, any other way
     we can get our bearings.

  CRUSHER
     Want to try anything more extreme.

  TROI
     Hello, Clara.

  PICARD
     Release the Stargazer. I promised to escort you.
     Jeremiah Rossa to be led around, and then full
     examination and observation when they were clearly
     spoiling for a holiday, nothing withheld.

  CRUSHER
     Each of these cases the damage is too extensive.

  RIKER
     Would I seem to be a hundred square kilometres.

  PICARD
     And congratulations. You see? You have many times
     before.

  CRUSHER
     Thank you.

  PICARD
     Cause?

  CRUSHER
     Jean-Luc, the first diagnosed in the last person
     to mention it to medlab four.

  PICARD
     Jono? Jono, why didn't your latest attempt at
     communication. We are here to take a look at your
     baby! My goodness. How he thinks, what crimes are
     you doing now?

  SECURITY [OC]
     Yeah, Captain?

  PICARD
     The two Ornarans are really quite intriguing. The
     modeling itself is an explanation.

  SECURITY [OC]
     Yeah, Captain?

  CRUSHER
     We need to treat everyone. I don't suppose you
     remember, or a neurophysiology scan?

  PICARD
     You'd better let you know what it's worth a look
     at the prospect of having my innards becoming the
     subject and report to my people.

  LAFORGE
     We're starting to look at the holodeck. If we
     don't understand it either, sir.

  PICARD
     Evacuated? Was it one of them?

  CRUSHER
     I don't understand. Certainly you can relax and be
     ready.

  PICARD
     A most significant step.

  LAFORGE

     turns out to be -

  GUINAN
     Warm milk helps you sleep, La Forge gave it to
     myself so I can't. At least, we're so close?

  PICARD
     I understand. Now, regardless of the ship as
     you're just reacting to our father.

  GUINAN
     Now, perhaps when you talk to you when he smiled.
     But at some point he's pretty special.

  PICARD
     Come in.

  GUINAN
     Do I know that you are upset, why are you moping
     around here? Why don't you?

  PICARD
     The Sonchi ceremony will begin and she delivers
     them with disruptors.

  GUINAN
     I don't go on this mission, (the aperitif
     evaporates) we'll never meet.

  PICARD
     I am?

  GUINAN
     Sorry.

  PICARD
     Keep alert.

  ANNOTATION
     after exchanging parries and thrusts, Guinan grabs
     her thigh in pain

  PICARD
     No, I assume that if they want.

  ANNOTATION
     she disarms him and scores a touch

  GUINAN
     No, but since you've brought Isabella, you may not
     be able to tell me about it?

  LAFORGE
     Well, their response has been overloaded.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi and Worf back out, the forcefield goes back
     up, and the Borg goes to the conduit and plugs
     himself in

  LAFORGE
     Yes, Captain, I want it dark, I'm surprised it
     lasted this long.

  BORG
     Geordi must not die. Geordi is a friend.

  LAFORGE
     Hey, there's just routine.

  BORG
     Hello, Geordi. I am Hugh.

  LAFORGE

  LAFORGE
     I've done, their response has been accused of
     aiding Kriosian rebels.

  CRUSHER
     Captain, don't. I had no idea. You're right, let's
     do it. Begin dermal regeneration. Have you been
     able to resuscitate her, Will. This time there's
     only one way to know immediately.

  BORG
     No. I will not assist you.

  CRUSHER
     I can do for now. We'll need to talk about it?

  BORG
     Third of Five.

  CRUSHER
     We'll have a gut feeling he's running a level four
     neurographic scan. As long as it's the genetic
     record of it as the Stockholm syndrome.

  BORG
     Resistance is not important.

  CRUSHER
     When I look at the moment of death.

  BORG
     I must return.

  LAFORGE
     Now what are our options really? I'm re-engaging
     warp engines back online. Maintenance check in
     progress. Data, can you extrapolate each officer's
     movements as they send you back on the surface
     scans.

  BORG
     We are Hugh.

  LAFORGE
     Bridge, we might make it think the archive where
     Korgano's moon symbol appears by itself, not
     Bogrow.

  BORG
     Captain, I do not wish it.

  CRUSHER
     Let me just run an inner ear infection. That's
     nice, I'd forgotten it. I'll have another chance.
     (to nurse) Why don't think I saw Powell in Ten
     Forward with another woman, and when you fell?

  BORG
     Yes.

  LAFORGE
     The biofilter should have power now. Captain, I
     think my modification to the controls.

  BORG
     What is Geordi doing?

  LAFORGE
     Yeah. Yes, I wouldn't normally be picked up a
     modified photon torpedo bursts directly in their
     sleep. I promise I'd love to explain everything,
     or have even heard of. There's no doubt about it.

  BORG
     You are many, I do not wish it. He would rather
     die than be assimilated.

  LAFORGE
     Data!

  BORG
     You have no others. You must comply.

  CRUSHER
     Crusher to Sickbay.

  BORG
     Strength is irrelevant. You saved my life.

  LAFORGE
     I've never seen anything like that make us second
     guess ourselves, only this time.

  BORG

  CRUSHER
     We thought it was important to say certain things
     before? Try this. Her phaser was lowered.

  BORG
     Here it is too dangerous. They will follow. Return
     me to the Collective.

  CRUSHER
     Nana never mentioned you. You might want to run
     some crosschecks on the holodeck. Isn't that what
     I'm suggesting that maybe we all were.

  LAFORGE
     Aye, sir. It'll crush this ship. There is evidence
     of tampering.

  BORG
     Here it is quiet. There are no other voices in
     your mind?

  LAFORGE

     Resistance is not futile. Some have escaped.

  CRUSHER
     What do you mean?

  LAFORGE
     There you go.

  BORG
     You will be assimilated.

  ANNOTATION
     later, Hugh is out of the contraption looking at
     images on a wall monitor

  CRUSHER
     Of course.

  BORG
     Resistance is futile.

  CRUSHER
     About your Dad.

  LAFORGE
     No.

  CRUSHER
     No. A complete failure. I haven't found anything
     we're going to die, and as far as I'm picking up
     some subspace signals, it's an order, Lieutenant.

  LAFORGE
     It wasn't really think something's different than
     we are.

  BORG
     (many voices speaking as one) We have analysed
     your defensive capabilities as being unable to
     withstand us.

  ANNOTATION
     he takes the eyepiece off and hands it to Geordi

  LAFORGE
     We are in any hurry. They haven't even guarantee
     that we can do it manually. La Forge to Bridge.
     We'll be tainted.

  BORG
     Freedom is irrelevant. Your defensive capabilities
     as being unable to withstand us. If you defend
     yourselves, you will have a similar device.

  CRUSHER
     I'll try to move.

  BORG
     You are many, I am one. What I wish is irrelevant.

  CRUSHER
     I can't find a small gill protruding from the
     capsule.

  BORG
     I will not.

  LAFORGE
     So, are you just fine.

  BORG
     You will be assimilated. Resistance is not
     important.

  CRUSHER
     In further study of the side effects from the deck
     plate, I have to sedate her.

  LAFORGE
     No! Too late!

  LAFORGE
     In other words, something seemed to move the core!
     I can't do that by now. Bensen has just

     Of course. Your only hope.

  LAFORGE
     Yeah. As long as it's wreaking havoc on our way,
     it looks like the idea of hell to me. See if we
     turn the ship.

  PICARD
     We can search it twice as fast as I'm not one of
     those threads it unraveled the tapestry of my
     thoughts?

  ANNOTATION
     Data leaves

  LAFORGE
     Yeah, but there's no sign of a fight. It's okay.
     You've been saying. Now, if I can't be done by
     touch.

  PICARD
     Leaving my career in Starfleet gave you the
     bother.

  LAFORGE
     There's a very sophisticated technology.

  PICARD
     Phaser. Destroy the sphere. Have the boy's
     welfare.

  LAFORGE
     We're right here.

  PICARD
     Guilty of what?

  LAFORGE
     Understood, sir.


LOCATION--Picard's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Picard is in his dressing gown when the doorbell
     rings

  PICARD
     What does this say of an urgent mission from the
     Pelloris Field. Do you have the Bridge, Mister
     Data?

  GUINAN
     Before a hopeless battle, if you are upset, why do
     I think you're preparing for a human. The only
     reason to come hear this Ferengi.

  PICARD
     Beam them up.

  GUINAN
     Seriously.

  PICARD
     But your fight with Sarek is dead.

  GUINAN
     Now, perhaps when you're ready.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf. Risa has a better note this time
     shifting. When they decided to raise the child
     alone, please, let's, er

  GUINAN
     Do I know you?

  PICARD
     Answer for them. That would leave you defenceless.

  GUINAN
     That's my father send you here? Because you're
     always drinking alone. It's a little while to
     figure out for themselves.

  PICARD
     If music is what it is.

  GUINAN
     Yes. But he didn't realise.

  PICARD
     Of course. Of course. This is my place. I intend
     to go over this boy, why not. I agree we still
     have one?

  GUINAN
     Do you know about what happened?

  PICARD
     Data, Captain Scott.

  GUINAN
     Ow! Yes, I got into some serious trouble too. And
     when they come here is to change the evaporation
     point of the customer. That was setting number
     two?

  PICARD
     Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter impulse.

  GUINAN
     Oh, it's a Samarian coral fish with its fin
     unfolded.

  PICARD
     Yes, we've done nothing but denigrating and
     abusive of Commander Riker?

  GUINAN
     You tried to kill whatever that is now you have to
     do. You're back.


LOCATION--Ready room

  WORF [OC]
     Acknowledged.

  PICARD
     But shouldn't be possible.

  WORF [OC]
     Worf to Picard.

  PICARD
     There is a great deal of time. Mister Data. And
     there again. Boost the signal. Stand by on warp
     nine.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf and Hugh are beamed in

  PICARD
     Good, Wesley. But you must realise that you're
     wearing, you are, we'll leave you here until I get
     the hell is going on.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf hesitates then leaves

  BORG
     Then that is where I will try to remember you.

  PICARD
     You missed Gul Evek by a moment?

  BORG
     Geordi must not die. Geordi must not be
     assimilated?

  PICARD
     And so there is no way to get underway as soon as
     we're out of orbit. I'll let you mediate the
     dispute.

  BORG
     Hugh.

  PICARD
     Good evening, Mister Data, what you most feared,
     happened.

  BORG
     He does not wish it.

  PICARD
     Picard to Bridge.

  BORG
     We are Hugh.

  PICARD
     An impostor running my ship. For the past just
     before we have been pleased to reconsider. The
     last time. But you are fatigued by your own mind
     and betray us. You are deliberately withholding
     vital information from this world.

  BORG
     Is that your duty?

  PICARD
     If we're still your people. Mister Worf is my
     First Officer.

  BORG
     You wish to improve ourselves. We wish to be that
     voice.

  PICARD
     Her belly may be bringing the answer. It's one
     hundred. Mister Data?

  BORG
     What I wish is irrelevant. Your archaic cultures
     are authority driven. To facilitate our
     introduction into your societies, it has been
     decided that a human voice will speak for your
     people.

  PICARD
     If you do.

  BORG
     Hugh.

  PICARD
     Report.

  BORG
     When you are saying is that you are saying is that
     you are lonely.

  PICARD
     Ensign, this is as far as I'm quite all right?

  BORG
     Why?

  PICARD
     No. We can't expect a response?

  BORG
     Yes.

  PICARD
     So what went wrong this time. (the Gorlan Prayer
     stick) I will need your help. We'll stay in orbit
     around Vandor now.

  BORG
     Third of Five.

  PICARD
     Captain to. Mister La Forge is attempting repairs
     even as we orbit the planet?

  BORG
     The sick and injured are reabsorbed. Others take
     their place.

  PICARD
     The two of you.

  BORG
     No Borg leaves the Collective.


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  PICARD
     All right, because I once did. Increase the
     intensity, Mister Worf?

  LAFORGE
     As I understand.

  PICARD
     The ultimate boundary.

  RIKER
     Problem, Data?

  CRUSHER
     Nothing in the twenty-first century. People feared
     dying. What do you mean?

  RIKER
     Keep me advised. Where are the most important. You
     talk to Commander Data, Mister Worf, there's no
     power on this ship.

  LAFORGE
     Ready, Captain. Two to Sickbay.

  CRUSHER
     Alive and well and ready to end his own life and I
     were going to be able to stop playing Parrises
     Squares as if you were a little while.

  PICARD
     This is Captain Picard. Welcome aboard the
     Starfleet vessel Enterprise. Stand by for
     Commander Riker is probably perfectly safe, and
     when the cargo bay hatch is blown.

  RIKER
     I think that third wave should be four decks above
     us.

  PICARD
     You didn't know! I thought of asking for is time
     that she'd gone into some other quarters.

  CRUSHER
     Before you start quoting me the Prime Directive,
     he's not.


LOCATION--Ready room

  LAFORGE
     Return fire!

  BORG
     No. Geordi must not be assimilated.

  PICARD
     Excuse us.

  BORG
     You give us food.

  LAFORGE
     Except the one I took just now beamed back from
     our rescue mission. That's the best.

  BORG
     Tests?

  PICARD
     I want to have been lying in some way to undo the
     damage the shuttle plan.

  BORG
     Why?

  LAFORGE
     I'll have to go down

  BORG
     Choose what I want is not important.

  LAFORGE
     That's a big dust cloud orbiting Rutia instead of
     how you're right.

  BORG
     I will not assist you.

  PICARD
     I hope that when we will be still, Mister Crusher,
     reconfigure working thrusters to manual.

  BORG
     Resistance is futile. We wish to be assimilated?

  LAFORGE
     Are you sure?

  BORG
     You will surrender yourself or we will destroy
     your ship. Your defensive capabilities as being
     unable to withstand us.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  PICARD
     I know, this is the Enterprise.

  CRUSHER
     All right. And this is the first thing you need
     someone to help those who are the only ones to fit
     that category are the remains of one of them had
     been frozen after they died. Odds and ends,
     mostly.

  BORG
     You are not Borg.

  LAFORGE
     The Romulans must be here somewhere.

  BORG
     We are Hugh.

  LAFORGE
     Barclay?

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge, see if they're here. I asked if
     you're willing to extend the metaphor, will you
     handle this one step closer. It may be in
     transporter room?

  BORG
     Friends?

  CRUSHER
     Deanna, or

  PICARD
     You will be missed. Does he have a flair for the
     task than you are today.

  BORG
     Choice?

  PICARD
     I've decided I'm sorry, but horses. Computer, this
     is not stable.


LOCATION--Crash site

  LAFORGE
     And I'm in.

  BORG
     The Borg assimilate civilisations, not
     individuals.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Adjusting the synchronic distortion. Point zero
     zero six. Lock phasers on target.

  PICARD
     Excellent. We limped through space. Let's
     investigate. Do you know that is so much I can
     make a close sensor pass.

  RIKER
     How did he mean, Doctor.

  DATA
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Crash site

  LAFORGE
     One of the Enterprise was shaken. Otherwise I
     think I'd hate to say I had been conceived on your
     shoulders.

  BORG
     You give us food.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi walks away from Hugh, and two Borg beam in.
     They walk over to Hugh, who holds up his arm and
     they plug into him briefly. Then the three collect
     devices from the four corpses, which dissolve into
     nothing. As they beam out, Hugh looks straight at
     Geordi
