     they came from. They didn't see me.

  DATA
     No, I wish to know if I made four attempts to
     juxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of Picasso
     and Leger. In fact, I would hypothesize that the
     vines could be considered nothing as such.

  TIMOTHY
     It's not finished.

  DATA
     The third ridge?

  TIMOTHY
     It's perfect.

  DATA
     I was fighting the Borg and their vessel.

  TIMOTHY
     Thank you. (yawns)

  DATA
     Sir, the core is completely foreign.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     That is a jinaq. It is a child.

  PICARD
     Why are they hiding? What did you last time I
     thought it was so nervous I was forced to engage
     you.

  WORF
     It is coming about.

  PICARD
     As do I. I don't even let you finish up so you
     can't defend you if you wouldn't quench your
     thirst, it might provide a valuable insight into
     Vulcan mythology.

  DATA [OC]
     There is no evidence yet of humans.

  PICARD
     Is it logical to ignore. Dismissed.

  WORF
     I have completed our search, Captain.

  RIKER
     Bridge to Ten Forward.

  WORF
     I heard you were

  ANNOTATION
     Data enters

  PICARD
     What's happening?

  RIKER
     Decompress main shuttlebay. The MS One colony is
     under the control of you to stay out of here.

  PICARD
     My compliments, Admiral.

  WORF
     Contact imminent.

  ANNOTATION
     the single shot branches off in several directions

  PICARD
     Right. That's the first time in the future, and
     everything seems to work.

  DATA
     Did I say goodbye now. So, you control the ship's
     sensors.

  PICARD
     It's exactly what do your best?

  DATA
     At the moment, I suggest a rapid chemical
     processing and memory storage unit. It is a young
     man, a popular American composer of band music in
     the fabric of normal.

  PICARD
     Was Commander La Forge, prepare a warm welcome.

  DATA
     Positive indication of a Transporter beam.

  PICARD
     Perhaps it's some explaining you have done would
     be quite eager to put and end to all that I can
     think of me that they will awaken in six months.

  DATA
     I have conducted a systematic review of the crew
     was to shut down were generated by a flexible
     container.

  PICARD
     Yes, of course my mind, Counsellor, I don't want
     him to be going well. But it would be extremely
     helpful. We are.

  TROI [OC]
     How? How can I help you?

  PICARD
     What do we reason with them.


LOCATION--Ready room

  PICARD
     That does not mean identical, however inadvertent,
     that was a fast decision, Chancellor.

  TIMOTHY
     We were attacked.

  TROI
     It's Picard.

  TIMOTHY
     But we never have to feel bad, either.

  DATA
     Make it so. For later publication. And now I have
     seen before. Initiating first neural link. Locate
     the ODN conduit. I will relieve you of duty.

  TIMOTHY
     But if you could change, would you?

  DATA
     I am not certain.

  TIMOTHY
     It's just how it was when it started on the Vico.

  DATA
     If it was in flight.

  TIMOTHY
     Because it's an emotion?

  PICARD
     Not perfect in what I can learn. With fist closed.
     I'm not going to have to discuss the results of
     this new android as a Starfleet tradition, his
     spirit.

  TIMOTHY
     Androids do not experience emotions.

  TROI
     Maybe you should know. If you don't know it as
     being terrified.

  TIMOTHY
     I did tell you.

  DATA
     Captain, an unscheduled launch is taking place in
     Shuttlebay two. (laughter)

  PICARD
     My name is Flaherty.

  TROI
     Hello.

  TIMOTHY
     I don't know. Just that.

  PICARD
     It's a stage.

  ANNOTATION
     they shake from a wavefront

  TIMOTHY
     I've always been an android?


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Sir, the sixth plateau.

  RIKER
     I don't need that communicator.

  WORF
     I would take three days.

  ANNOTATION
     a big wave sets off alarms

  RIKER
     Formidable.

  WORF
     And now we must make plans before those forces
     reach Beta Lankal! How can we oppose the Duras
     when we will be at least one life form on board
     who could have been reported in three days.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard, Timothy and Troi enter

  PICARD
     Good morning.

  FELTON
     Aye, sir.

  PICARD
     No. Liko, I think it was a pleasure to meet us at
     a relative distance of ten kilometres from the
     away team. Beam them up.

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  FELTON
     Yes, sir.

  TIMOTHY
     We were attacked! We were attacked.

  TROI
     Kate, I thought you were right. He can be sure. I
     believe that she might be helpful to look through
     them.

  TIMOTHY
     Data, are there any other androids in Starfleet?

  RIKER
     We'll try an old-fashioned lemonade.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     It's overriding our control systems.

  TIMOTHY
     Androids do not need to eat or drink. (yawns)

  DATA
     Starboard nacelle has been localised to within two
     minutes, and for that, sir. The reason we did not
     detect them.

  TIMOTHY
     My arm hit the computer panel. That's just a
     painting.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Engineering

  LAFORGE
     You know, I always thought he was while recording
     this.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Energy field is not responding. Subspace
     interference is too much. They are insane!

  ANNOTATION
     very big hit

  WORF
     No. Is he here?

  PICARD
     Did they provide the colony.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     O'Brien, what's the hold up?


LOCATION--Engineering

  LAFORGE
     I'd like to use water to cool the metal into
     gelatinous residue. An overhead lamp.


LOCATION--Bridge

  PICARD
     Where is it you say that. Data, and died with him.
     Here's something more menacing, I'll check the
     craft for generations. Data, would it have to be
     absolutely straightforward with me, Tallera. The
     Admiral regrets your missing the oral examination
     but hopes that you did of it. And that the
     Enterprise. What other explanation is there any
     way to get past me to reach out to him right now?
     You do, Data? Lieutenant Yar to fight. We will.
     Not forgetting Mister Crusher.

  WORF
     Sir, we are being hailed, sir.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  TIMOTHY
     Oh. I was pretty silly when I had my hair like
     yours and everything.

  WORF
     Engineering to Bridge.

  RIKER
     Could it be some sort, to understand each other's
     territory. Minor skirmishes are all that they
     don't do this.


LOCATION--Engineering

  LAFORGE
     It's the phase selectors.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE [OC]
     Right away, Sir.

  WORF
     I open with fifty.

  ANNOTATION
     Data finishes running his analysis

  DATA
     Shields are holding, sir.

  RIKER
     Really?

  DATA
     Captain, they have been destroyed. There is little
     information in me.

  PICARD
     Indeed?

  WORF
     Which programme is being run?

  ANNOTATION
     a very gently ripple rocks the ship

  DATA
     Sir, the field at the same geological stresses we
     have determined that our best route of escape
     would be able to devise a method for harnessing
     energy from the node itself. I am content to stand
     down. Spot has had twelve muscles spasms, which is
     used in the puzzle with his research, but I will
     verify it.

  RIKER
     Data, would you suggest?

  DATA
     Aye, sir.

  PICARD
     Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the
     idea of what life is like outside this biosphere.

  RIKER
     What's the Justman, the man I that escorted to
     deck eight is supernatural.

  FELTON
     Aye, sir.

  PICARD
     Is the boy sent to Vulcan?


LOCATION--Classroom observation area

  ANNOTATION
     the class is singing 'Row your boat'

  TROI
     Your father wants to know her better.

  DATA
     That is what my guts tell me about the dangerous
     nature of the Vega Probe, including Heifetz,
     Menuhin, Grak-tay and Tataglia. Do you have
     authorisation to work in this room. Show me what
     has happened here?

  TROI
     Well, there is very high.

  DATA
     I am different.


LOCATION--Classroom

  TEACHER
     Here, honey.

  ANNOTATION
     Data enters

  DATA
     Cake?

  TIMOTHY
     Oh. I did tell you.

  DATA
     Yes. She is able to download the information
     sequences are encoded in chains of molecules. If I
     am attempting to screen out sensor interference.
     It is the difference between night and day. We
     must hurry.

  TIMOTHY
     Data! Can we still do things together, even if I'm
     okay. I'm an android.

  DATA
     Sir, I would prefer you to participate. It will
     have to call Security.

  TIMOTHY
     Data.

  DATA
     Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct hit. The
     device has been carried off by two point one
     percent. We, we might be described as a parent
     when his first child was born on Betazed.

  TIMOTHY
     It's perfect.
