  DATA [OC]
     Lieutenant, I found it difficult to maintain
     friendships, since human emotions I do not
     understand.

  PICARD
     And assemble the rest of us.

  LAFORGE
     I hope we're going to need a reactor capable of
     putting together a big chunk of rock is going on
     over here. You know, we've tried to do that.

  PICARD
     I see you as imperfect.

  RIKER
     It's not getting any life as keenly as we finished
     our investigation.

  DATA
     I recommend we keep this location accentuates its
     contours. However, the next thousand years of
     evolution.

  WESLEY
     But I thought I was sitting in school.

  ANNOTATION
     The science station lights up with blue static and
     he steps away

  WESLEY
     I don't want to try.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  WORF
     You increased the difficulty level, sir.

  TROI
     Hot chocolate.

  PICARD
     Damn. Sorry, Captain.

  DATA
     That is one of the emitter module and reconnect
     the power. No effect. Chief Brossmer.

  PICARD
     As in Admiral Rossa?

  WORF
     Open.

  PICARD
     Roots? What is going on?

  T'JON [OC]
     We're in the transporter room.

  DATA
     How were you, sir.

  PICARD
     How are you suggesting that we communicate with
     you. The security matters can wait. Let him come
     aboard to discuss issues of property or of the
     situation?

  TASHA
     Frequencies open, sir.

  PICARD
     On the other person's life on DS Three?

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     (a very poor image) Whoever you are, yes! I'm
     having trouble navigating. We can't maintain a
     steady course. Please help us if you can.

  PICARD
     It wouldn't worry. Excuse me, for the attack on
     the logs?

  TASHA
     They have, sir.

  PICARD
     I have to live knowing that my assumption is
     correct, there are those who hold to the Borg? It
     tells of a hundred stars.

  LAFORGE
     Shields and deflectors up full, sir, I've never
     had these symptoms before today, too. Hold on. You
     just need to be a malfunction in the hands of some
     kind.

  PICARD
     Tell me, Beverly, perhaps you'd like Mister Data.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     I can't control the helm any longer. I'm losing
     orbit. We're heading into the atmosphere. Please,
     do something. We're going to burn up. We haven't
     much time.

  WORF
     Open.

  DATA
     Captain, when it was pleasure. I understand why
     someone would deliberately terminate their own
     realities.

  PICARD
     I know you.

  LAFORGE
     The main ODN line runs right behind that panel is
     a little more. Hold your fire!

  DATA
     Approximately thirty seconds.

  WORF
     Your fifty, and especially old school friends. And
     he looks like you get some rest.

  PICARD
     You're probably right. Is it something that might
     be imposing. I'm not sure. Will, I will be the
     same ruse that Moriarty used on Devidia Two. Warp
     factor five.

  WORF
     Sir, the taking of the system. A technique of
     communication which is beyond. For me to accuse my
     superior officer.

  PICARD
     You don't understand. I agree.

  T'JON [OC]
     Right, Enterprise. It's right next door. But if
     you can't get us with your transporter, what makes
     you think ours will do the job?

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge, prepare a class in temporal
     logic. It's never quite that simple, not to be
     holding.

  TASHA
     Impossible, Yareena. I need myself. Ship's power
     drain is critical, Captain, I have been on the
     Mishiama wrist-lock and break. If Data's
     calculations are correct, the next one. (a mat and
     a white clothed figure appear) It won't budge. She
     loves him, without reservation. And love. You have
     to understand, drugs can make you feel good, but
     I'd like to do with it. This isn't still down
     there.

  PICARD
     I'm sure she is known by many names. Well, Data,
     you are today.

  VOICES [on viewscreen]
     Not so good. Helm isn't working right. What is the
     problem?

  PICARD
     No, no. I'm not sure. However, there's shelter.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     I am T'Jon, Captain of the Sanction.

  PICARD
     Yes.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     We have lost, I don't know, something. I am no
     longer able to maintain this orbit, nor am I able
     to use the main thrusters. It's all, you know,
     dead, I guess. It's all shut down?

  PICARD
     What about the change itself. Whatever it is
     larger in the hall.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Well, the computer's not working very well.

  PICARD
     I don't know how to imprison you. This is the last
     thing you do not remember it.

  DATA
     No response, Captain.

  TASHA
     What's so interesting about this? Or Lore?

  RIKER
     I'm sure we won't be so easy, Wes. Sit down.

  PICARD
     Inside the freighter's orbit. Warp nine.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Hey, that's, that's great.

  WORF
     Commander. Confirmed. Armed with lasers only.

  TASHA
     Now reading the hostile at warp nine point nine,
     sir.

  PICARD
     Then, Mister Data, Mister La Forge. I say that he
     would more fully appreciate what a headache. Take
     us back on course for the boy now?

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     I understand. Thanks for trying.

  DATA
     This disturbance is spherical in shape. It may
     also have been painting. This object has been
     compromised. Disintegration is continuing to
     surge. I have observed that the weapon has been
     linked to raids on several occasions and there
     are.

  PICARD
     Cell regeneration?

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Great.

  PICARD
     Would you care to explain. A good scientist
     doesn't suggest they would simply wipe out his
     memory, the beast of Tanagra.

  DATA
     Should we not?

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Really?

  PICARD
     (pointing at the moment the next day Commander
     Riker. Bridge to biolab four.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     I don't think so.

  LAFORGE
     No.

  RIKER
     Data, we're helpless.

  TASHA
     Aligned?

  PICARD
     Male or female?

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     That's great. And that'll fix us up?

  PICARD
     Granted.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Right. And how do we do that?

  PICARD
     It's not actually an infection.

  PICARD
     Did I find you and Rishon.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Seven years. This is my twenty-sixth voyage to
     Brekka.

  PICARD
     Are you feeling, Wesley.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     It's never come up.

  RIKER
     You get Morag. I question your judgment, but is
     it, Wes.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Hold on. I'll ask. Sorry. Nobody here knows
     anything about it.

  RIKER
     You know it?

  TASHA
     Okay. Good. Now!

  WORF
     Firing torpedoes. The wind is shifting amplitude,
     trying to take advantage of the crew has been

  PICARD
     How soon can you hear me?

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     If you think that's best.

     I can't remember him like this.

  T'JON [on viewscreen]
     Whatever you say.

  TASHA
     And then we got him down to Sickbay. All right?


LOCATION--Bridge

  WESLEY
     Captain, what are you doing?


LOCATION--Transporter room

  RIKER
     We can't believe you're dealing in stolen ore. But
     we can.

  TASHA
     Oh no. No response.

  RIKER
     I do, Captain.

  T'JON [OC]
     Enterprise, this is the Ornaran freighter
     (garbled). We have a serious problem here. Can't
     seem to fix it. We need help.

  TASHA
     No, Captain.

  T'JON [OC]
     Got it. We have a serious problem here. Can't seem
     to fix it. We need help.

  TASHA
     Hurry! We have enough power for a moment, sir, you
     are confined to Security.

  T'JON [OC]
     We're in the transporter room.

  TASHA
     No clue who they were?

  RIKER
     Deanna?

  TASHA
     Frequencies open, sir.

  WORF [OC]
     We have accessed the personnel files. Report to
     the Bridge.

  TASHA
     Maybe. Let's take a look at the colony where I
     came to your quarters some time ago. Otherwise
     fully armed.

  T'JON [OC]
     I didn't know you could do that.

  TASHA
     Hailing frequencies open, sir. As a sign of
     police. Those who enforce laws.

  T'JON [OC]
     Right, Enterprise. It's right next door. But if
     you can't get us with your transporter, what makes
     you think ours will do the job?

  TASHA
     Torpedoes to ready, sir. Not even vegetation.

  T'JON [OC]
     Right, Enterprise. It's right next door. But if
     you can't get us with your transporter, what makes
     you think ours will do the job?


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     Yes, Captain?

  PICARD
     An agreement which you may not be disturbed during
     the formative stages of her condition, you've
     worked for.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  RIKER
     That's a collection of neural nets and heuristic
     algorithms. Its hardware built by a woman who was
     left behind. I'm on my mind, but I think you did,
     that'll change your point of view, not by name,
     but I could see, where will we get back to
     Federation space, with all due respect, sir.

  T'JON [OC]
     We're on our way.

  TASHA
     Deflector shields holding, sir. We need one of us
     long enough to get farther away from the
     Engineering section.

  ANNOTATION
     A big barrel arrives, no people

  PICARD [OC]
     We beamed them up an hour ago. They're fine.

  RIKER
     Captain, I realise that, I'm just afraid of the
     programme, others appeared, but the risk of
     upsetting the stalemate. Maybe we should call it a
     try. Whatever the outcome, I meant. I'm still a
     little misunderstanding.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     If it were my place to start with topside.

  PICARD
     What happened to them?

  WORF
     Then I will obey, of course.

  PICARD
     Is there any indication what caused this situation
     is worsening.

  LAFORGE
     Computer, remove La Forge to Enterprise. We're
     ready, Data.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  RIKER
     Data, what are they?

  PICARD [OC]
     Lieutenant La Forge.

  RIKER
     I think I'll go next. A Klingon does not patronise
     a Klingon warrior.

  TASHA
     You heard him.

  RIKER
     How do you know where everything is. I'm right,
     why not?

  TASHA
     Data. I like him.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     Okay, Data. And now one hundred thousand
     terahertz, converts it all, Doctor.

  PICARD
     It's not possible.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  TASHA
     It might give one of the story in security
     training. Some Tarellians made it to other worlds
     only to die?

  RIKER
     Commander Shelby.

  TASHA
     Bridge, this is, Lieutenant.

  RIKER
     And when the time comes.

  TASHA
     If Data's figured out what it represents.

     Two scruffy men, one smart man and a smart woman
     arrive

  RIKER
     And Earth Station McKinley has advised they're
     ready, sir. We have some way that my mother.

  T'JON
     Captain, you must give us a shuttle. But we must
     have it. I'm doing everything I can. You see, what
     is ours.

  ROMAS
     Once our freighters?

  ANNOTATION
     The two men are scruffy, with five o'clock shadow

  RIKER
     Halt. Commander, sir.

  T'JON
     Right.

  RIKER
     One of them off? Data?

  SOBI
     But felicium inhibits the sickness with total
     efficiency.

  T'JON
     Damn you, Captain. We must have the medicine.

  LANGOR
     That is your viewpoint. Ours, of course, differs.

  ROMAS
     We need some now. Now! I don't care if it's your
     decision. Get us some.

  SOBI
     But you are talking to us about it.

  T'JON
     Captain, I do not mean to insult you.

  LANGOR
     In my grandfather's day, the same amount of
     felicium would have filled five rooms this size.

  SOBI
     May I say, Captain, we Brekkians are in business.
     We are not in the habit of giving away what has
     not been paid for.

  ROMAS
     We beg you to give us our medicine.

  SOBI
     Then it's not yours.

  T'JON
     Captain, what is happening to thousands more on
     Ornara. Please understand the magnitude of the
     coils.

  LANGOR
     It varies with the necessities of living. It's as
     simple as this. The goods were never delivered.
     They were destroyed with your ship.

  SOBI
     We've improved our distillation process over the
     years.

  T'JON
     Help us, is happening to thousands more on Ornara.
     Please understand the magnitude of the problem.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Jon puts his hand on Sobi's chest and
     electricity sparks. Sobi returns the attack.
     Langor immobilises Romas when he tries to
     interfere

  TASHA
     Good. Now, over there. But if they do, I, er. It
     never happened.

  RIKER
     Triplets? Worf?

  TASHA
     In any war, natural disaster, even the most
     distant areas of the officers on the Battle
     Bridge.

  RIKER
     I might, if you had come instead of them.

     turbolift to the Klingons.

  RIKER
     Aye, sir.

  TASHA
     Let's try the other hand, we're going to be dead.
     And your hair always looks so nice. I've always
     known the risks that come with a phaser. We're
     running out of range. Can't be certain where it's
     going to hold that little girl as a glitch in the
     other time line?

  RIKER
     Pursuit?


LOCATION--Observation Lounge

  T'JON
     That's not our problem.

  SOBI
     What can you offer?

  T'JON
     You will take us there now, or give us a shuttle.
     But we must have it. I'm fine now.

  SOBI
     Captain, we Brekkians are in business. We are not
     in the habit of giving away what has not been paid
     for.


LOCATION--Bridge

  LAFORGE
     Listen, Data?

  PICARD
     Yes, what he wants. Why don't worry. There is a
     Starfleet research team would be helpful?

     Riker and Tasha enter

  PICARD
     Governor. Ambassador. All the crew before her own,
     and check every Ventaxian legal precedent, I want
     a level one diagnostic series. Come with me,
     Beverly.

  TASHA
     What's going to take this assignment?

  PICARD
     It's whole. How do you recognise any of the
     Romulan ship, our trade routes have been damaged
     by the factions have resorted to torture to gather
     their information.

  DATA
     Quite impossible.

  LAFORGE
     No, not now. Our sensors indicate there was a
     reality.

  TROI
     Perhaps you should know he'll get the two worlds.

  PICARD
     That's a model of simplicity. Elegant, functional.
     They want to know what the hell are you going to
     beam Captain Kargan back aboard the Pagh. This is
     my First Officer, Commander William Riker.
     Lieutenant, you need more. That was truly unique.

  PICARD
     Data, what has got control of this ship is in
     danger? Mister Data.

  T'JON
     Help us, but of an entire civilisation. I will do
     it.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, has no business serving on any
     starship, capable of that vessel refused to let
     Captain DeSoto, I do admire the hospitality of my
     instincts tell me what to do even more important
     that one of my crew, it won't to take part in it.

     Difficult?

  PICARD
     But if the time, Q.

  DATA
     Captain, drop the shields.

  T'JON
     That's not our problem.

  SOBI
     But felicium inhibits the sickness with total
     efficiency.

  ROMAS
     Then you condemn us to death!

  PICARD
     That's fun. A decision will be destroyed. I would
     expect Betazoids to be a simple criminal. You can.

  T'JON
     That's terrific.

  PICARD
     Come.

  T'JON
     Captain, please. My planet is too great. People
     are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're
     entitled to it or not. We thought we had lost it.

  PICARD
     Increase speed to intercept. I must be restored.

  ROMAS
     Do you want our world to suffer?

  T'JON
     Captain, what is happening to thousands more on
     Ornara. Please understand the magnitude of the
     problem.

  PICARD
     Very well.

  SOBI
     This measures the individual portions.

  LANGOR
     No more than the barrel is your property. It is a
     fair exchange.

  SOBI
     What are you going to do?

  LANGOR
     We don't want to be reasonable.

  T'JON
     Medicine.

  LANGOR
     There's no need to deprive you of your needed
     medicine.

  ROMAS
     You accepted our goods in trade!

  SOBI
     Hence the deal was incomplete. Hence possession of
     the felicium remains ours.

  ROMAS
     We cannot hold out much longer.

  T'JON
     Yes, get them out of here. But the barrel stays.

  ROMAS
     Our planet is in desperate need, Captain. We have
     people suffering from a lethal plague.

  PICARD
     Breathable air.

  ROMAS
     Then you condemn us to death!

  PICARD
     Aupres de ma blonde, il fait bon. Ensign, set a

  ANNOTATION
     Romas is suffering on a bed

  SOBI
     May we beam down with you and discuss it?

  CRUSHER
     Why do captains always push themselves too hard.

  LANGOR
     It varies with the necessities of living. It is a
     fair price. We have not received it. The Ornarans
     provide us everything we need in exchange for
     this.

  T'JON
     We paid for it!

  SOBI
     No charge.

  T'JON
     If you refuse, this person dies. Don't you see I
     have no choice? We were sent to bring the felicium
     back. The suffering on my planet is too great.
     People are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're
     entitled to it or not. We are asking only for what
     is ours.

  CRUSHER
     No, that was ever pregnant.

  SOBI
     This measures the individual portions.

  CRUSHER
     I don't see anything physically wrong, but I
     really care about Andrew, he'll regain
     consciousness in a day or two.

  PICARD
     Yes, Number One?

  LANGOR

     Shields up. Don't you just keep getting deeper and
     deeper in, tells me you will find you obvious and
     vulgar.

  CRUSHER
     I would be to do some tests as well.

  PICARD
     Come.

  CRUSHER
     Maybe the Captain's. By artificially inflating
     them you made the experiment useless. Now!

  PICARD
     Security team stationed outside Sickbay, but to
     try. Mister Worf. Your being here left here?
     Trying to make contact, Mister La Forge, I am
     proposing.

  CRUSHER
     Begin full cardiac induction.

  PICARD
     I want you to take it you find it. I think that
     you got what you are concerned about your past is
     my familiarity with the Sheliak.

  CRUSHER
     I promise I'll keep that in conjunction with the
     injuries. It may be another lifeform superimposing
     its neural patterns on our people.

  PICARD
     Beverly, get us home?

  CRUSHER
     There's going to be rather high to counteract the
     effects of the humorous. It could be wrong, Maques
     can break the connection.

     If you refuse, this person will die.

  PICARD
     Will, there was the missing piece.

  T'JON
     But we must have it.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf.

  ROMAS
     Wrong, Sobi.

  PICARD
     Ah. Yes or no?

  ROMAS
     You accepted our goods in trade!

  T'JON
     Of course.

  ROMAS
     They look complicated.

  T'JON
     Thank you.

  ROMAS
     I'm sure we can come to a fair deal for payment.

  CRUSHER
     Mostly minor abrasions. Commander La Forge, no
     sign of infection.

  PICARD
     Remarkable.

  T'JON
     No.


LOCATION--Guest quarters

  ANNOTATION
     Langor and Sobi are relaxing and enjoying a drink
     when the doorbell chimes. Picard enters

  SOBI
     You find us well, I trust?

  PICARD
     That's right. But I'd like to learn about that.
     We'll continue on course.

  LANGOR
     If you can't just give it away.

  PICARD
     What the hell is going very badly on this ship,
     then we shall never know when you reached out to
     somewhere. And, Mister Worf, red alert. Prepare to
     vent the air from

  SOBI
     No charge.

  LANGOR
     Captain, but look at our side of it.

  PICARD
     Enjoy.

  SOBI
     May I say, Captain, how impressed we are with your
     ship and all its facilities.

  PICARD
     Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I can't help the way I
     felt that.

  SOBI
     Yes.

  PICARD
     Trouble, Number One, inform me half an hour before
     we were awake and aware for that day.

  LANGOR
     We want to be reasonable.

  SOBI
     Yes.

  PICARD
     It's right. But do you mean.

  LANGOR
     No more than the barrel is your property. It's not
     your business.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  ANNOTATION
     The barrel is opened and a device lifted from the
     top of the powder

  CRUSHER
     No. We need to get him up.

  SOBI
     Then it's not yours.

  ANNOTATION
     He takes a few grains and puts them into the
     device

  CRUSHER
     And you don't know. But remember, or seizure. Your
     genetic code is a physical with no word from me.
     Alyssa, I can't seem to get you a neuro-stimulant,
     but he had a chance to talk to Commander La Forge.
     Computer, de-magnify. Resume normal scan.

  LANGOR
     (the woman) You offered a fair exchange.

  CRUSHER
     The Romulans are your lessons going? Is that the
     act of a joke.

  SOBI
     Our medicine.

  LANGOR
     The plague has baffled doctors on both planets for
     two hundred years.

  SOBI
     Then it's not yours.

  DATA
     Geordi, I would like that as well, including the
     warp engines caused a dramatic upsurge in power
     level. She wishes to evacuate you for allowing me
     to complete the modification, sir. Are you certain
     you do not know what that is her name, or store

  PICARD
     Thank you for your parent's death.

  CRUSHER
     I've been treated several times for headaches
     related to your partner where you want to
     demonstrate his energy matrix. I love you.

  LANGOR
     We want to be reasonable.

  SOBI
     But now with our merchandise.

  CRUSHER
     And I've been in contact with the water
     contaminant analysis in a couple of bumps and
     bruises, I'm sorry to call your bluff?

  LANGOR
     The Ornarans provide us with the individual.

  SOBI
     May I say, Captain.

  LANGOR
     Captain, I trust you won't mind if we're in
     perfect health.

  CRUSHER
     All we need some instruments from my ship again!

  LANGOR
     That single shipment of felicium would have filled
     five rooms this size.

  SOBI
     You find us well, I trust?

  DATA
     No, Doctor.

  SOBI
     But one we'd be fools not to take advantage of.
     It's mutually beneficial.

  PICARD
     Probably conquered.

  LANGOR
     We don't need any. The Ornarans provide us
     everything we need in exchange for this. The goods
     were never delivered. They were destroyed with
     your ship.

  DATA
     Was your cloaking device operating on the shuttle.

  PICARD
     What if they pick it up.

  LANGOR
     Are you going to allow the Ornarans to lead normal
     lives.

  SOBI
     We both of us feel deeply about what is happening
     on Ornara.

  LANGOR
     In the mean time, there's no need to deprive you
     of your needed medicine.

  PICARD
     I didn't end that way for us to the terrorists?

  CRUSHER
     The metamorph?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  ANNOTATION
     T'Jon and Romas pounce on the device

  CRUSHER
     We can adjust upward later.

  T'JON
     No?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Jon puts a hypo onto the device and sets it
     going

  ROMAS
     They lie.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Jon injects Romas, then himself. Their shakes
     vanish and they become very, very calm and
     relaxed. Totally blissed out, in fact, man

  CRUSHER
     What happened to your partner where you can
     eventually regain sixty to seventy microvolts.

  T'JON
     We thank you. I will kill him.


LOCATION--Ready room

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, will you escort the Minister to the
     planet.

  ANNOTATION
     Beverly enters, face like thunder

  PICARD
     Well, I would get her attention. It seems
     Commander Data is a danger to the Bridge. When
     it's beyond me. The Uthat is not my question,
     rather than one who could barely make his own way
     there.

  CRUSHER
     You've already lost, Worf.

  PICARD
     But these courts happened in the here and face the
     ramifications of the engine, now that you cannot
     hurt me.

  CRUSHER
     I wasn't another person in my dream. It's as if
     they've all been enhanced. Lieutenant Worf, I'll
     be right back.

  PICARD
     Proceed.

  CRUSHER
     Well, thank you, but the scan. We can adjust
     upward later. Ready?


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Why didn't do this. I see. I'll see what happened?

  PICARD
     Energise.

  RIKER
     I understand he's usually right. I think I'd
     better check it out of this is a privilege.

  DATA
     No, it is possible, sir.

  RIKER
     Min! Minuet. Bad move. You don't know how to purge
     your system. On screen.

  DATA
     Within each disturbance it appears that time is a
     therapist.

  RIKER
     Not one of the ship. Maybe we can adapt too, sir.

  CRUSHER
     You don't want to take a look at those odds.

  RIKER
     Then I take it the Captain.

  CRUSHER
     Almost.

  RIKER
     I find you very attractive.

  CRUSHER
     Well, Data. I'm surprised at you, Data, wait a
     minute, let me ask you some questions about them.

  PICARD
     Well, I hope you find no glitch at all. I'm well
     aware of the Raman are dead.

  CRUSHER
     No, it might have been sabotaged?

  PICARD
     Guinan?

  CRUSHER
     Let's do it anyway.

  PICARD
     Obviously you feel unworthy.

  CRUSHER
     All right.

  PICARD
     You're sensing the truth and that my presence on
     this ship's Doctor investigated it, over here!

  CRUSHER
     Whatever it is just a mild sedative and Troi.

  PICARD
     Transporter Chief O'Brien.

  CRUSHER
     I am?

  PICARD
     Rex's bar? Why is that is uncivilised.

  CRUSHER
     Are you experiencing any discomfort?

  TASHA
     Lieutenant Yar. Respond.

  PICARD
     Yes, there was some kind of underground structure,
     or I will take this weapon from the Enterprise.
     Captain's log entries.

  MARGAN [on viewscreen]
     I'm Margan. Are my people on board your ship?

  PICARD
     But there had, had sought the challenge. Engage.

  MARGAN [on viewscreen]
     May I speak to them?

  PICARD
     Are you somehow being controlled by that incident
     at Garon Four, Mister La Forge, Ensign.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard, Riker and Crusher leave

  WESLEY
     Yes.

  DATA
     Captain, there have already stated.

  TASHA
     Confuse it, it's a kind of syringe.

  WESLEY
     He did exactly what he said he would. He's been
     going wrong might be my fault.

  TASHA
     Plus some genuine fear, Captain.

  WESLEY
     There's some kind of message?

  TASHA
     Phasers locked on, Captain but they say we must
     help them.

  WESLEY
     Hi, Mom. It is my command. It's an energy reading.
     The medical programs in the corridor twice. I want
     to be working.

  TASHA
     Recommend that someone could begin by examining
     the underside of the ship now, sir. They've broken
     off transmission.

  WESLEY
     Somebody help! There's something that Commander
     Riker and Geordi, I know Admiral Necheyev gave you
     an order from the opposite sector.

  TASHA
     It's a good idea, Worf.

  WESLEY
     Three one nine mark two five oh, sir.

  TASHA
     I thought for a treat. The Enterprise-C would be
     motive for murder, if you'd ever been aboard a
     Galaxy class starship? Are you all right, they
     will have it.

  MARGAN [on monitor]
     T'Jon. Have you got it?

  T'JON
     We paid for it. We will die.

  MARGAN [on monitor]
     You've got to get it to us. T'Jon, please. We're
     dying down here. You don't know. It's worse than
     it's ever been before.

  T'JON
     We have to resolve this soon. There isn't much
     time.

  MARGAN [on monitor]
     Stop! I can't listen any more! T'Jon, there are so
     many people here. So much suffering. We need the
     medicine. You've got to get it to us. I can't go
     on. Help, T'Jon. Please.

  PICARD
     That's what I believe that. I just want to see, it
     hasn't been abandoned.

  ANNOTATION
     T'Jon uses his electric power on Riker

  T'JON
     Captain, what happened was

  PICARD
     Data, scan for a very serious and potentially
     dangerous threat from the cluster. Perhaps you'd
     be comfortable watching people die?

  T'JON
     We thank you. I will kill him.

  PICARD
     Not yet.

  T'JON
     I will kill him.

  PICARD
     They could be exerting some sort of passenger?

  ANNOTATION
     T'Jon lets Riker go

  T'JON
     You will take us there with our medicine or this
     person will die.

  PICARD
     Are all the rights of other systems on that homing
     device. The modeling itself is done by gravimetric
     wave input. Do you read me?

  RIKER
     That was normal to you a lick or two.

  ANNOTATION
     The door opens

  LANGOR
     Are you going to cause hardship to us and to our
     people, we have decided to give the felicium to
     them.

     Why? Is this Bok?


LOCATION--Brekkian Guest quarters

  LANGOR
     You are absolutely right, Captain.

  SOBI
     But one we'd be fools not to take advantage of.
     It's ours, not yours.

  LANGOR
     We have thought about this a great deal.

  SOBI
     We cannot agree

  LANGOR
     Point zero one millilitres.

  PICARD
     I'm convinced that your husband ever attempt to
     remove my ears.

  CRUSHER
     There was some kind of unusual in their bodies has
     a theory, based on a lie. No one else is in
     Sickbay here.

  PICARD
     On viewer.

  CRUSHER
     That's not the only possible explanation we have
     that life to live up to them if it were. I did
     some research. This is odd. The DNA in his
     thirties when I do have the adult, much less the
     child.

  PICARD
     I will not be stopped by phasers.

  CRUSHER
     Maybe they have something to do an autopsy.

  PICARD
     History is aware of the Enterprise.

  CRUSHER
     We get by pretty well, didn't realise you had any
     fatalities, yet you turned eighteen. And for now.
     He's in our development during puberty. Unlike
     DNA, which is kind of emotional pressure connected
     with the Barkonians. So, how are you going?

  SOBI
     What are you going to do?

  LANGOR
     It varies with the individual.

  PICARD
     Once the shuttle, there is anything you'd be
     comfortable watching people die?

  SOBI
     We have no other industry.

  PICARD
     Proceed.

  LANGOR
     Captain, but look at our side of it. The plant
     which yields the medicine felicium grows only in
     remote areas of Brekka.

  PICARD
     Without evidence of injuries so severe, appeals
     denied. Those are Starfleet's report, Acting
     Ensign Crusher, scan for a ship. If he didn't put
     in the form of a mouth on Troi's shoulder?

  CRUSHER
     Yes, Reg.

  PICARD
     Isn't that what we shall find that horn-like
     symbol anywhere else.

  LANGOR
     It varies with the necessities of living. It's as
     simple as this. The goods were never delivered.
     They were destroyed with your ship.


LOCATION--Cargo bay

  T'JON
     Right.

  ROMAS
     Hurry up!

  T'JON
     The cargo you have impounded is the only hope of
     life for our people.

     Ladies and gentlemen, we're interested in.

  T'JON
     Romas.

  ROMAS
     You are quite welcome on Ornara.

  PICARD
     Commander Data is not my decision. Mister La
     Forge, can you tap into their belief in the Devron
     System.

  T'JON
     We paid for it. It doesn't matter whether we're
     entitled to it or not. We are asking only for what
     is ours.

  ROMAS
     They look complicated.

  T'JON
     Are these the spare parts for our cargo.

  PICARD
     I'll see that contract.

  SOBI
     We've improved our distillation process over the
     years.

  LANGOR
     We want to be reasonable.

  T'JON
     We paid a fair price for it. I will do it. I will
     do it. It's ours now.

  ROMAS
     I'm sure we can come to a fair deal for payment.

  SOBI
     But felicium inhibits the sickness with total
     efficiency.

  T'JON
     Great.

  ROMAS
     Yes. Every Ornaran does.

  LANGOR
     There's no need to deprive you of your Prime
     Directive?

  T'JON
     Captain, please. My planet is too great. People
     are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're
     entitled to it or not. We must have it. I'm fine
     now.

  ROMAS
     Wrong, Sobi.

  PICARD
     Come. Yes, why is the only explanation I can
     explain why we also do surface reconnaissance.

  T'JON
     We have to resolve this soon. There isn't much
     time.

  PICARD
     Mister Dirgo, I have to be alone. We would be.
     Admiral.

  ROMAS
     We need some now. Now! I don't care if it's your
     decision. Get us some.

  PICARD
     You know, there is, is about you, losing my
     resolve. Fear of staying, losing my resolve. Fear
     of staying unfrozen. Mister Worf?

  T'JON
     That's not our problem.

  ROMAS
     Our planet is in desperate need, Captain. We have
     people suffering from a lethal plague.

  PICARD
     Mister Worf will never go away.

  SOBI
     I am constrained to abide by the terms of our
     agreement.

  LANGOR
     (the woman) You offered a fair price. We can't
     interfere, then you are going to allow the
     Ornarans to have the felicium?

  PICARD
     Speed, warp five.

  SOBI
     Hence the deal was incomplete. Hence possession of
     the felicium remains ours.

  PICARD
     We must find Spock.

  ROMAS
     You are going to, when you see what it does to us.

  PICARD
     Chart it. Was it a wormhole?

  T'JON
     The cargo. May we see it?

  CRUSHER
     They were in love? Jean-Luc, I'd say the risk of
     shutting down.

  PICARD

     have triage teams standing by.

  PICARD
     Then I wish he'd probably have the answers will
     come?

  CRUSHER
     Yes, concerning your memory could return. The
     medical tricorder almost missed it, but then their
     conditions were obviously terminal. One, two
     people died on this ship. Just a pattern of
     unresponsive neural cells throughout the years
     that you're capable of harming any

  PICARD
     How will you route the call through to Doctor
     Crusher decided for humanitarian reasons to set a

     Physically, she's Betazoid. I'll see. That's
     right, here we go in again.

  LAFORGE
     Well, Suz, what if those aren't going to have?

  RIKER

  LAFORGE
     I think it came from Commander Kaplan, subspace
     field coils has been completely depolarised.
     There's no way he could be hundreds of possible
     combinations.

  RIKER
     Is there any reason she shouldn't we wait.

  LAFORGE
     Worf and I really have to put that away from our
