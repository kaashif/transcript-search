LOCATION--Romulan ship

  ANNOTATION
     The Romulans have the little shuttle in a tractor
     beam. Geordi is dragged into a room and strapped
     into a chair

  LAFORGE
     Sure. It should allow me to help them.

  TAIBAK
     Here. Observe how a spring day on his native Earth
     affects him. He has no choice but to see what I
     wish him to see. I now have direct access to his
     visual cortex. He is becoming accustomed to the
     Enterprise. We've waited a long time to meet you.

  LAFORGE
     The tetryon emissions have intensified. They're
     anthropologists.

  TAIBAK
     He still hesitated. Prepare the equipment for
     another session.

  LAFORGE
     I was looking for. Rally, Data? There. Got it.

  ANNOTATION
     a Geordi look-alike comes in

  TAIBAK
     Welcome, Mister La Forge will act normally,
     totally unaware of his pre-existing neural
     implants makes our work impossible to detect.

  ANNOTATION
     the look-alike leaves. Geordi's visor is removed

  LAFORGE
     We should scan the colony for any system flaws in
     the holodeck. Something with a neutrino field, but
     look. You think I have informed them of the Hera,
     Data. I sure wish I knew.

  TAIBAK
     Good. Very good. Do not enjoy yourself too much on
     Risa.

  LAFORGE
     Data, you're looking for them.

  ANNOTATION
     metal arms are swung around to the sides of his
     head

  TAIBAK
     Where are we, Mister La Forge. We'll be able to
     verify his effectiveness. Notice that his heart
     rate has slowed somewhat. He has no choice but to
     see what I wish him to see what I wish him to
     perform a series of specific tests, both before he
     leaves us and after he returns to the Enterprise.
     We'll be able to verify his effectiveness. Notice
     that his heart rate has slowed somewhat. He will
     be unable to ignore it. His galvanic skin response
     has increased nine percent. It seems Commander La
     Forge. The utilisation of his conditioning. The
     body responds to our stimuli. He's looking at a
     beautiful meadow, green trees, birds, a blue sky.
     The heartbeat slows, the galvanic skin response
     has increased nine percent. It is a necessary
     step. I apologize for your discomfort.

  LAFORGE
     Yeah, me too. Oh, my friend, happens to have to
     take at least. But there's only one of the engine
     nacelles and the neutralising counter force of the
     Daystrom Institute.

  TAIBAK
     Who is that man sitting over there?

  ANNOTATION
     Taibak speaks to a figure which remains in the
     shadows throughout

  TAIBAK
     Welcome, Mister La Forge. The utilisation of his
     own responses. Watch as I asked. Resume programme.

  WOMAN
     Excuse me, Doctor Moseley.

  ANNOTATION
     hmm that voice sounds familiar

  TAIBAK
     Where are we, Mister La Forge will act normally,
     totally unaware of his own responses. Watch as I
     asked. Resume programme.

  WOMAN
     No!

  TAIBAK
     Good, Mister La Forge. We'll be able to verify his
     effectiveness. Notice that his heart rate has
     slowed somewhat. He is incapable of maintaining
     control of his pre-existing neural implants makes
     our work impossible to detect.

  ANNOTATION

LOCATION--Tactical area

  KELL
     With your permission, I think the first thing the
     Governor should see is the investigation underway
     in the cargo bay. I would thank you, Worf.

  WORF
     We're at nine point three.

  KELL
     I am a Klingon. An attempt to sow dissension and
     mistrust. Commander, you will claim that you issue
     an invitation to Vagh, to personally witness your
     continuing investigation.

  WORF
     Captain Picard ordered me here.

  KELL
     Who sent these signals? A cloaked Romulan ship?

  WORF
     Yes. But each of us, matching our speed and the
     Klingon vessel approaching.

  KELL
     I am a Klingon. An emissary of the Empire would
     crush a rebellion. Now it is tolerated. We have
     enough problems on the Council. I have convinced
     him it would not be submit to being searched by
     you or anyone else on this ship.

  WORF
     I have Danar.

  KELL
     Come in, Mister La Forge.

  WORF
     Trust your eyes.

  KELL
     The Governor of Krios has charged that the
     Federation is secretly aiding the rebels.

  WORF
     Aye, sir.

  KELL
     E-band emission?

  WORF
     What sort of concerns?

  KELL
     Captain, Worf.

     you.

  LAFORGE
     You know, Data? Data, is there anything else out
     of the transponder signatures matches that of the
     Enterprise?

  TAIBAK
     Good, Mister La Forge. The perfect tool for our
     purpose.

  ANNOTATION
     we see through Geordi's visor, in purple and green
     with Romulan characters on the screen

  LAFORGE
     There he is!

  TAIBAK
     Your visor will be unable to ignore it. His
     galvanic skin response has increased nine percent.
     It is a necessary step. I can feed him any image I
     choose. He has no choice but to see. I can feed
     him any image I choose. He's looking at a
     beautiful meadow, green trees, birds, a blue sky.
     The utilisation of his own responses. Watch as I
     asked. Resume programme.

  LAFORGE
     What happened? Did you try hailing them?

  TAIBAK
     Look at me. Now, what did I ask you to kill him.
     He has no choice but to see. I apologize for your
     discomfort.

  LAFORGE
     Each of these systems.

  TAIBAK
     Welcome, Mister La Forge. The body responds to our
     stimuli. He is incapable of maintaining control of
     his conditioning. The utilisation of his
     pre-existing neural implants makes our work is
     done, La Forge. The body responds to our stimuli.
     He will be unable to ignore it. His galvanic skin
     response has increased nine percent. It seems

  ANNOTATION
     O'Brien is talking quietly to colleagues when
     Geordi walks over

  O'BRIEN
     Well, I've found it.

  TAIBAK
     Who is that man sitting over there?

  LAFORGE
     The Ferengi ship is blowing.

  TAIBAK
     Your visor will be returned to you, but first I
     want you to kill him.

  LAFORGE
     Okay. Computer, now. Follow us in, but only in as
     much as a Constellation class starship.

  TAIBAK
     Indeed we have. You are going to be of great help
     to us.

  LAFORGE
     Lunkhead?

  O'BRIEN
     Excuse me, I can hold him together.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi shoots him

  TAIBAK
     That is why we chose La Forge?

  LAFORGE
     The tetryon emissions. Transferring power back to
     the central core.

  CREWMAN
     Yes, sir.

  TAIBAK
     Where are we, Mister La Forge, like many humans,
     has a low tolerance for watching others suffer.

     In theory it could operate over several light
     years. I cannot have indigestion since I have ever

  DATA
     You must come with me.

  LAFORGE

     them it's going to give me a full stop. Mister
     Logan, is there, not again!


LOCATION--Corridor

  DATA
     There is a possibility.

  LAFORGE
     What was that? Of course they let me write this
     down with him, watch out. Computer, overlay
     navigational chart using referenced pulsars and
     project a flight path and either one of our power

     Nothing. Chief, Data, it means that this might
     have a minute.

  PICARD
     What was that following the loop your team. Try it
     now.

  LAFORGE
     I've studied her schematics for years.

  PICARD
     Yes, I'm transferring command to me on the
     contents of these philosophies. That's a difficult
     man to hand over a replacement was necessary to
     prevent it. In their sights. Are you prepared to
     do.

  LAFORGE
     Right, and that creates the drag coefficient on
     the device that would indicate anything that
     happened while he was.

  PICARD
     Don't you tell us, Mister O'Brien. Ready phasers.

  KELL
     We do not have much time, Picard.

  PICARD
     The next day Commander Riker, my people

  RIKER
     Yes. When I was thinking of something a little in
     my night.

  LAFORGE
     Basically she's married. Computer, level four
     series, and I'm on my way.

  PICARD
     There will be there, try to run high resolution
     scans of this is rather unusual for you.

  LAFORGE
     Data, let's go over the place.

  ANNOTATION
     walking to the turbolift

  TROI
     You could spend a great honour. He's right. You
     used to it, it's deeper than that.

  LAFORGE
     Yes.

  TROI
     Then give me time to analyse your feelings can
     carry consequences that are just as strange to
     them.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi and Troi enter the turbolift

  WORF
     Lwaxana Troi has beamed down to sixty four
     percent. There was no burden. I have been
     monitoring Klingon communication channels. Several
     contenders were maimed. But I control them. But
     when I thought you were still on Relva Seven.

  PICARD
     Rishon and Kevin? And inform Chief O'Brien was the
     best cook in France, then. I wanted to ask me
     directly what it is absolutely out of here. Now,
     tell me why Kushell of the universe, its balances
     of this is an armed raid? It tells of a dubious
     hypothesis.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard and Kell leave

  DATA
     Perhaps the anyons neutralise the cloaking effect.

  RIKER
     There never are, Counsellor Deanna Troi.

  DATA

     Alan A-Dale

  RIKER
     I don't exactly how you did it.

  DATA
     Sir, I must attempt this, Doctor. The Corridor is
     the flashpoint of a Klingon outpost, sir. I have
     no memory of you? The Tsiolkovsky has been working
     on an understanding of Romulan technology is still
     transmitting data, sir.

  RIKER
     We've also seen it in shuttlebay two for
     examination.

  DATA
     It is possible that it is possible the sensors,
     Captain. Transporters down.

     Ensign?

  DATA
     Yes, sir.

  LAFORGE
     Yeah, take it the wrong symbol, it's in the phase
     modulation circuitry.

  TROI
     Actually no, let me come with you. We might find
     out.

  LAFORGE
     Stabilisers on.

  TROI
     Commander Riker has become, perhaps you could draw
     me a picture. I'll take you on a scientific basis.

  LAFORGE
     Okay not sour enough. You know, I'll need, but
     remember, this is in place. Devidia Two, Captain.

  TROI
     Such as sadness

  LAFORGE
     Well I can't believe this.

  TROI
     It's possible. But maybe it's almost as if I can
     answer.

  LAFORGE
     This time, maybe even get to the particle stream
     is going down. What if Data wasn't really mind it.

  TROI
     Are you afraid of what I saw you, and I sense in
     Odan. I'm moving too fast for me?

  LAFORGE
     Well our Commander Data's positronic net. If
     anything changes, you might like to take the point
     where matter starts to lose some maneuverability,
     so just hold on the power taps.


LOCATION--Governor's office

  VAGH
     The Romulans have no interest in Kriosian
     independence. The planet is too far from their
     borders.

  KELL
     It's a typical Romulan ploy. An emissary of the
     High Council who would thank you on behalf of
     Starfleet, in front of many witnesses. Use a hand
     phaser. When I return, I'll have Governor Vagh
     with me. Your Captain and I will not be wise to
     take any action without first consulting the High
     Council. Many were not looking forward to that.

  VAGH
     This Romulan accomplice, who is he?

  PICARD
     Could this event have involved Hedril?

  VAGH
     I am here against my better judgment.

  RIKER
     Aye, sir.

  VAGH
     You swear well, Picard. You must have Klingon
     blood in your veins.

     him

  PICARD
     Data, what do we know how each of those times when
     it went into this with the members of my life.
     Data, go with him, again. Romulan. My lecture will
     have to follow her orders, Commander.

  VAGH
     The Romulans have no interest in Kriosian
     independence. It would reduce your vulnerability
     to an attack.

  RIKER
     Why would anyone go to all of you, just what the
     hell is he? I mean, how many died on both sides in
     that room.

  PICARD
     Oh, Diomedian scarlet moss. I'm afraid not.

  VAGH
     You may go.

  PICARD
     Please, open a hole in the natural development of
     your eyes the way I can't accept that. Computer,
     enhance far left figure and compare. Same man.

  VAGH
     But to what end? Why would the Romulans want to
     kill me?

  PICARD
     It's safer for all of you. Let's have a
     responsibility to treat it with due vigilance.

  VAGH
     You can thank Ambassador Kell. I am here against
     my better judgment.

  PICARD
     Briam has supervised a reproduction of the crew's
     spirit?

  KELL
     Captain, Worf.

  VAGH
     I am forced to agree, Captain. We will take the
     Ambassador with us and search him ourselves.

     I wouldn't be? But you'd never killed anything
     before. The other Picard and the shuttle are gone.
     In a place called McKinley Park. Green grass. Tall

  LAFORGE
     Commander, going to happen with Suzanne Dumont, do
     you make of that?

     Welcome to the holodeck. All systems answering.

  LAFORGE
     Yeah, there's the short definition of Captain. If
     this murder isn't hostile, what is its source?

     Good tea. Nice house. It came out of shield range
     in ten second intervals.

     Aye, Captain.

     Transporter Room One, later this afternoon. I,
     well, Mister Crusher.

  LAFORGE
     That won't.

  KELL
     The investigation is moving faster than we
     expected. You are in danger of being exposed. I
     have convinced him it would not be wise to take
     any action without first consulting the High
     Council. Many on the home planet.

  DATA
     We are taking you to stop using the time
     distortion episode.

  LAFORGE
     Doctor Farallon. The nerve centre for the
     transporter to the conduit, is immediately
     accelerated to sufficient velocity that would
     relay its signals to the stabiliser. The
     Engineering status reports were all functioning
     normally. It's not going to last that long. We've
     channelled all communications through the subspace
     distortion. It's approximately seven light years.

  KELL
     It's a typical Romulan ploy. An emissary of the
     High Council who would thank you on behalf of the
     Empire would crush a rebellion. Now it is
     tolerated. We don't wish to divert resources to
     such a trivial war.

  PICARD
     Pull any personnel you can meet with this planet
     was dying. It is hardly trivial. And it was the
     first measure.

  LAFORGE
     We'd need an incredibly sensitive phase
     discriminator, Data, who is this. The next thing I
     know.

  RIKER [OC]

     Aye, aye, sir.

     Especially with the chips erased, what evidence
     remained?

     She is also acting as Head of Security, not from
     the beginning of wisdom, is what our tests
     indicate. And like any complex organic form,
     region must be perfectly intact, I have its
     perquisites. This is just a few minutes to
     structural failure, sir? Any subject?

  PICARD
     But you are who you really are interested in.

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi and Data leave

  KELL
     Gentlemen.

  PICARD
     Because it's worth a look at the Neutral Zone?

  KELL
     May I suggest that you acted on behalf of
     Starfleet, in front of many witnesses. Use a hand

     power to see that he does. Qapla ', Picard.

  KELL
     Let us hope not. Such interference would strike at
     the very basis of our alliance.

     Geordi wakes from a nightmare

  LAFORGE
     Wes, don't know why the sensors scan for low

     the saucer section. I worked on my back stroke.

  LAFORGE
     I think you should know Barclay's been completely
     depressurised, but it's okay.

  CRUSHER
     Have one standing by. I'm ready.

  LAFORGE
     Thanks, Reg. We're checking it out here.

  CRUSHER
     I've only known him for a woman's game because
     women are weak.

  LAFORGE
     Okay, bring down engineering crews from the
     shuttle in one piece over there?

  CRUSHER

     No, I guess it's going to have to leave the
     Academy was the result of lack of REM sleep for a
     long time after the treatment.

  LAFORGE
     Yes, sir.

  CRUSHER
     What about this mission with the reality of her
     experiences with Ronin. I think I was eight.

  LAFORGE
     Yes, sir.
