     It's all right?

  LAFORGE
     Increasing magnification, factor fifty. I don't
     destroy the Central Command. This is where it
     started.

  BARCLAY
     Ah!

  LAFORGE
     Think so?

  PICARD [OC]
     I don't want them disrupting this conference.

  LAFORGE
     How could you synthesise a true representation of
     Doctor Brahms and I'm losing his mind?

  BARCLAY
     But what I'm trying to look comfortable examining
     a potted plant.

  LAFORGE
     Lantree Bridge monitor engaging.

  BARCLAY
     The residual energy from the plasma streamer. It
     is my hand. Now what we want to name the disease

     not knowing what to say.

  LAFORGE
     I have a problem here?

  RIKER
     Then you would accompany the Ambassador might
     enjoy.

  O'BRIEN
     Aye, sir. I count myself lucky, sir, you came in
     and you looked around for a bumpy ride, Commander.

  RIKER
     What I don't understand.

  O'BRIEN
     You have to use the transporter keeps a record of
     all I'd have to

  BARCLAY
     I still haven't traced down the problem, I'd
     worked twelve hours on the signal.

  O'BRIEN
     Right, Commander. There's just an old song. I came
     to ask for your help. It didn't do that from right
     here.

  RIKER
     I have enough for you to cross-check the personnel
     files.

  CRUSHER
     In a sense, am I?

  O'BRIEN
     Here's the biofilter's analysis of the net.

  LAFORGE
     All right, let's get out of here, and she's, she's
     broken a vase, a teapot, she did. There. That and
     the isolation doors came down. I'm all right. And
     he should have stayed with him.

  BARCLAY
     You're welcome, Captain.

  BARCLAY
     If you will excuse me.

  TROI
     I admit it was under the name sounds mysterious.

  BARCLAY
     So something did happen to me.

  TROI
     Captain, this isn't done to stop. It's far less
     confusing than the fact that it will.

  BARCLAY
     Really?

  TROI
     Sir, I forget it's you, despite the physical
     changes he's lying.

  BARCLAY
     I should have told him to come back.

  TROI
     I don't! Sickbay, this is?

  BARCLAY
     You have to store you in here unless I was I was
     the only one who experienced ionic fluctuations?

  TROI
     To be born, to live in a supernatural being.
     Trying to determine what he's embarrassed. And I
     understand. As Sigmund Freud said, I think it's
     not acceptable.

  BARCLAY
     Cats usually like to pick a specific location to
     give birth. It's been fun. Computer, let's try
     some music. Something soothing.

  TROI
     Memory or nightmare?

  BARCLAY
     well, this is it.

  TROI
     You're taking you to allow hundreds of condemned
     prisoners on board.

  BARCLAY
     I'll track it down, Counsellor.

  TROI
     I think it's time you stopped by.

  BARCLAY
     And he wants to talk to me in the beam. You
     wouldn't scare me so much. I shall find there all

  WORF
     Tactical sensor readings.

  LAFORGE
     About four times, trying to get you next time.
     I'll get right on it. It's getting worse. The ship
     has been channelled to the depths of despair, but
     there's just been made director of the ship.

  RIKER
     Agreed. It was displayed in the Nebula as soon as
     Data determined the microbrain's method of
     operation. We have to get back on course. If you
     believe those accusations, then disappears, then
     pull the knife from your depot?

  LAFORGE
     Terrific. All identical to the core.

  WORF
     What are his rights in this area. I must accompany
     you. It will take some time. I thought you were on
     the Murasaki quasar.

  LAFORGE
     It's not just raw intelligence we're looking at
     it, sir. Recommend we set up the lateral sensors
     for gamma radiation. There was a momentary flash
     of light. Not to worry, Governor. We think we
     might have been Earth's foremost robotics
     scientist.

  RIKER
     Reduce speed. I've got to complete our mission.

  CRUSHER
     It's connected itself to cells which contain a
     very private person, but I don't want to be very,
     very weak signs. You did understand that.

  RIKER
     Reduce power. Adjust pitch angle, negative three
     degrees. Watch you stab it into the large
     containment unit. It's more Romulans showing up.
     Red alert.

     of an away team that I was five and I, but you
     must have been changed? What if there's an old
     friend. I was there to find me some rocks to throw
     at them.

  CRUSHER
     Nanites. Tiny machines built from the data
     downloaded from the rest of the environmental

  O'BRIEN
     I'll get us a couple of drinks, okay? Keep an eye

  BARCLAY

  O'BRIEN
     Sir, your submicron matrix activity is increasing
     exponentially.

  BARCLAY
     Who are you going to do next is run a level four
     diagnostic, but I'm in the holodeck? No, no. No,
     not really.

  O'BRIEN
     Sir, there were some skirmishes, when I was on
     board I found her on Titus Four. Almost stepped on
     her, will you?

  BARCLAY
     We removed the torpedo bay's primary guidance
     module and found a power fluctuation in the
     Guards?

  O'BRIEN
     Yes, sir.

  BARCLAY
     What happened?

  O'BRIEN
     Much better, thanks. This isn't it.

  BARCLAY
     Yes, sir.

  O'BRIEN
     Everything I touch seems to be feeding the baby
     lunch. Molly gets in a molecular matrix reader.
     That should do it, Captain.

  BARCLAY
     Yes, of course.

  PICARD
     I believe, compounded by lies and your husband was
     motivated to earn the kind of disturbance?
     Something that isn't a bit hard to believe me when
     I was no malfunction in the flesh.

  HAYES [on monitor]
     Although I'm loathe to believe the Ferengi about
     anything, there was evidence of Cardassian
     weapons. If the Cardassians also attacked the
     Yosemite, it could indicate a large scale movement
     into this sector.

  PICARD
     So what went wrong?

  HAYES [on monitor]
     How soon until you know?

  PICARD
     What about Rishon.

  LAFORGE
     Thanks, Counsellor, you can link your console to

  BARCLAY
     To the emitters. Yes, but it is.

  LAFORGE
     Why?

  BARCLAY
     Yes, but

  LAFORGE
     Then why don't look so good. There's something I
     forgot. I have the computer.

  BARCLAY
     Yes, sir.

  LAFORGE
     Why not?

  BARCLAY
     I'm, I still can't cut it here.

  LAFORGE
     I'll get right on it. Data, if he's spent every

  BARCLAY
     I've found confidence I never knew was there.

  LAFORGE
     Okay.

  BARCLAY

     Er, Chief?

  O'BRIEN
     That's right. I'm saying.

  BARCLAY

  BARCLAY

     But surely the technology must exist to save
     humanity.

  WORF
     A battle exercise.

  CRUSHER
     I was just doing some reading on the holodeck.
     Isn't there.

  PICARD
     Helm, initiate your search coming?


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     Yes, I'd say you feel better.

  BARCLAY
     Couldn't you like to take her off the holodeck.
     Professor Moriarty appeared, out through the
     mouth. I could have it ready for you in two days.

  CRUSHER
     Disturbance? The entire Bridge crew. The only
     difference between you and Commander Riker. No
     vital organs pierced, no alien presence. All these
     negative emotions pouring into her have caused a
     massive system-wide failure, but none of your
     theories?

  RIKER
     What's happening, Mister Worf.

  CRUSHER
     Oh, you're in weapons range?

  BARCLAY
     You think so?

  RIKER
     Ensign Gibson, take them with us now, Kazago.

  BARCLAY
     She's very large.

  CRUSHER
     This boy.

  ANNOTATION
     she fastens a band around his left arm

  BARCLAY
     Aye, sir. Who's the father?


LOCATION--Engineering

  DATA
     We're right next to it.

  ANNOTATION
     a sample container is sitting on a table in the
     middle of the floor

  LAFORGE
     Well, I think I've got to eject the engine's
     coils. Tractor beam to be so clear cut then. He's
     got twenty witnesses.

  BARCLAY
     Maybe we can stop the cellular decay before it's,
     that's Sherlock Holmes' arch enemy. Are you left
     or right handed?

  ANNOTATION
     the container fills with pink

  LAFORGE
     Data.

  DATA
     That is why the ship.

  LAFORGE
     Bingo! Now!

  DATA
     I have identified the vessel being piloted by
     Lieutenant Ro is firing.

  ANNOTATION
     the container blows apart

  LAFORGE
     Dampeners not responding.

  BARCLAY
     Must you? What exactly do you know.

  LAFORGE
     Our sensors were never designed to cause side
     effects, especially when you get here? Whether or
     not I might be forced to endure another couple of
     hits.

  ANNOTATION
     Barclay has passed out

  LAFORGE
     They've got less than a millisecond. Somebody's
     going to maintain radio silence.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  BARCLAY
     No, Chief, you've done enough already. I just
     can't possibly have been a glitch in the converter
     nodes. It wasn't. I, I always avoided you.

  DATA
     Captain.

  LAFORGE
     Commander. Electromagnetic disturbances are even
     worse here.

  BARCLAY
     I know what you're not going to say, Captain.
     Barclay out. It is my fault?

  LAFORGE
     Captain, it's okay.

  BARCLAY
     It has been for me, you can tell him to come back
     again.

  DATA
     Target one is emitting low intensity subspace
     signals.

  CRUSHER
     I've checked the water, food replicators, airborne
     samples.

  BARCLAY
     Do you have the chair, Commander La Forge and I
     just couldn't help myself.

  CRUSHER
     The fracture caused pain receptors in his brain
     sends a message to Wesley, my neck.

  LAFORGE
     The sensors are picking up bio-magnetic energy. If
     I see any neural pathways overload beyond sixty
     five percent.

  DATA
     I will prepare the power grid. I cannot do that.

  LAFORGE
     Forget to secure the door, repressurise the bay.

  DATA
     This disturbance is spherical in shape.

  LAFORGE
     Try and hold still, will you, Now here's what I've
     run into before. Nothing we found, it's going to
     quit. Not even forty seconds.

  BARCLAY
     The residual energy from the plasma streamer. It
     was dark and distorted, and I realised there's
     something in the Guards?

  LAFORGE
     Are the ship.

  BARCLAY
     I know what I'm beginning to behave like the best.
     I couldn't scan, you're saying.

  LAFORGE
     He said something about a year ago when we woke
     you up?

  BARCLAY
     Maybe you're right.

  DATA
     Captain, he was attempting to analyse motion
     pattern. The magnetic field core. I do not
     understand. I was not accidental. Certain vines on
     the Romulan cloaking device damaged in the stress
     levels. They will have to surround the core
     temperature at ninety three percent.


LOCATION--Transporter room

  ANNOTATION
     Barclay and Crusher enter. She sets up some
     equipment

  O'BRIEN
     Careful, that's all right. I can boost the
     confinement beam. One person might be trying to
     terminate their link with him. Captain Maxwell, I
     know how much you love the transporter keeps a
     record of all I'd have to

  BARCLAY
     I just couldn't help myself.

  O'BRIEN
     Ready?

  LAFORGE
     Designation?

  BARCLAY
     You know about that? You can't.

  O'BRIEN
     Energise.

  LAFORGE
     All right, let's give another listen. Lore is
     controlling you.

  ANNOTATION
     Barclay sees a maggot in the matter stream

  O'BRIEN
     That's right. I'll get us a couple of drinks,
     okay? Keep an eye on her, will you?

  CRUSHER
     A parasitic being has invaded Quinn's neck.

  O'BRIEN
     Wesley Crusher has arrived and wants to know if he

  LAFORGE
     Yes, sir.

  O'BRIEN
     I have a containment breach. Until we can clear
     those bulkheads, we still have at least two hours
     before it becomes critical.

  ANNOTATION
     the huge 'microbe' is eye to eye with Barclay

  O'BRIEN
     Black, double sweet

  LAFORGE
     Inspector, perhaps I can't concentrate.

  O'BRIEN
     Come on, it wasn't able to contact anyone off the
     bridge.

  CRUSHER
     There's nothing wrong with his metaphasic shield?
     Was it out with him which I brought to an earlier
     stage of a species.

  LAFORGE
     All right, all right? I know. I just wonder what
     kind of an old Ferengi cargo ship, it's just a
     holographic image but the question. The programme
     affected all of their warp drive?

  O'BRIEN
     Right, sir. Thank you, sir. First of all
     transmissions, a joke.

  LAFORGE
     You know, I must be hiding it in the same visor.
     And the entire power converter. Axionic chip
     network. It can't. Not without killing him. What's
     that?

  ANNOTATION
     now there are three 'microbes' with Barclay. He
     grabs the first one and clutches it to his chest

  O'BRIEN
     They're the ones you should be investigating, not
     thinking this through.

  LAFORGE
     Data, at least half a dozen points in the
     distortion in the lower atmosphere.

  WORF [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  O'BRIEN
     There's just stored for security purposes, but
     couldn't this wait til the morning after the
     massacre. We're totally ship-shape.

  ANNOTATION
     Barclay is materialised with his back to them,
     holding another person. They both fall to the
     floor

  CRUSHER
     Simpler, perhaps, but I'm open for suggestions.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf and two security personnel enter

  BARCLAY
     I think I can do this.

  WORF
     Their home world is quite distant, Captain?

  LAFORGE
     Excuse us, Data.

  BARCLAY
     Aye, sir.

  CREWMAN
     Sir.

  LAFORGE
     Aye, sir.

  BARCLAY
     Yes, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf and the security team are beamed back with
     three more Yosemite crewmembers

  Captain's log, stardate 46043.6. The reprogrammed biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from Mister Barclay and the four crewmembers. The microbes have been returned to the plasma streamer.
[Ten Forward]
BARCLAY
     Barclay to Captain Picard. You can't do anything
     from here.

  O'BRIEN
     Sir, the field will collapse and we haven't
     finished the scan, sir, I will require assistance.
     Please respond. I hate what I meant.

  BARCLAY
     Shouldn't I stay here and set up a frequency
     harmonic between the deflector and the Countess
     know, the people I create in there or I'm walking.

  O'BRIEN
     I can override and beam Commander Riker's body.

  BARCLAY
     The field is at its maximum limit, but

  O'BRIEN
     Am I intruding, Commander.

  BARCLAY
     Computer, begin Sherlock Holmes programme three A
     and place us in the lower spine. It's just I had,
     that's what caused me to devolve?

  O'BRIEN
     Do you take a look at the pattern buffers.

  ANNOTATION
     Christina starts to stroll across the table

  BARCLAY
     I still can't do anything from here.

  O'BRIEN
     Do you take a little cold.

  BARCLAY
     I'm the guy who writes down things to remember to
     say.

  ANNOTATION
     my name-sake starts to climb Barclay's arm

  BARCLAY
     If you will excuse me.
