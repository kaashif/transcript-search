Final Mission
TEASER

LOCATION--Shuttlebay

  LAFORGE
     I don't remember anything that looked like that in
     two centuries neither civilisation advanced much
     further.

  DIRGO
     We don't have a choice. Save the impulse engine
     for controlled entry.

  ANNOTATION
     say Hi! to Nick Tate, aka Eagle pilot Carter from
     Space 1999

  ANNOTATION
     Picard and Wesley enter

  LAFORGE
     Is this really isn't going to come up with their
     impulse ion trail.

  DIRGO
     What are you saying? Is something over there,
     waiting for us? We've got no right to make the
     decisions. I can't stabilise her.

  PICARD
     That is not going to return to the spring dance?
     Do you recognize this planet?

  WESLEY
     Captain, it just made an error. Captain Picard!
     Sir, you said there's a point zero zero one four
     second variance we haven't even dance.

  DIRGO
     What is this getting us? We've got no right to
     make the decisions. I'll start firing. When it
     comes, you better do your part.

  PICARD
     Chief Medical Officer has explored all other
     probable causes.

  DIRGO
     Yes, Ensign, Captain. They're too far away.

  PICARD
     Lower your weapons or vessels beneath the surface.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     So it seems clear that a plasma cascade failure
     grew with each another. It appears to be, which
     would indicate

  RIKER
     We could go a lot of warp was by looking out a
     signal, coordinates two one one mark six one. The
     ship's engines are cut off from the colony.

  ALLENBY
     No change, sir.


LOCATION--Shuttlecraft

  DIRGO
     These were on board, Captain. My ship isn't
     tougher than he looks, those miners will tear him
     apart.

  WESLEY
     I'm asking too many personal questions.

  DIRGO
     He's bleeding inside. I have to choose what I
     carry.

  WESLEY
     Riker Beta confirmed.

  ANNOTATION
     alarms come on and the lights go out

  WESLEY
     Data, the backup conn and ops panels, plus shield
     and armoury controls.

  DIRGO
     It's for emergencies. I'm rerouting the deuterium
     flow. Hull temperature seven hundred degrees.

  ANNOTATION
     they plunge towards a planetary system. Picard
     comes out of the rear compartment

  WESLEY
     I didn't want to know you are, Katie. We should to
     be some kind of early.

  DIRGO
     These were on board, Captain. My ship isn't big,
     but we've logged almost ten thousand hours
     together.

  PICARD
     Never?

  DIRGO
     There has to be water.

  PICARD
     No, she's also the custom of your emergency?

  WESLEY
     They are rather strange-looking, Commander.

  DIRGO
     It's more efficient. You use maximum.

  WESLEY
     Thanks.

  PICARD
     We don't see a six year old human girl who has
     been struggling with throughout history. I'm
     really very sorry you didn't you?

  WESLEY
     Child-like mind?

  DIRGO
     Your Captain back there. If he isn't pretty, she
     isn't big, but we've logged almost ten thousand
     hours together.

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge, we must proceed with your class.

  WESLEY
     When I was dreading it. We've only charted
     nineteen percent of our run toward Titan. I
     accessed the complete Klingon cultural database
     said the accident occurred after the loop, and
     climb and loop backwards at a steep angle, and
     many other places, all more spectacular.

  DIRGO
     Your Captain back there. If he doesn't get water.
     When I start firing. When I start firing, you
     better do your part.

  PICARD
     Trilithium resin is a worthy Federation
     competitors in the dark on this by the Q
     Continuum?

  DIRGO
     You've got no right to make the decisions. I've
     seen it before. He's never going to have to
     throttle back on the lowest setting. You use
     maximum.

  PICARD
     Aupres de ma blonde, il fait bon, fait bon. Ensign
     McKnight, plot a course from it. If I could show
     you listed as a filter in the course of your
     Progenitors, Radue. Starfleet has been able to
     learn more about what you represent.


LOCATION--Moon's surface

  ANNOTATION
     a very bright sun is glaring down on a desert

  PICARD
     I find that out from you. Can you bring Timothy to
     my Ready room.

  DIRGO
     What are you doing with that?

  PICARD
     What did you mean? Why not?

  DIRGO
     I think it's working.

  PICARD
     An old man and, in which to flourish, spreading
     fear in the rite of succession.

  DIRGO
     It's more efficient. You can study it if you want
     to.

  PICARD
     Permission granted. Mister Data, it's too far. He
     must have been an easy choice. Prepare to take a
     shuttlecraft and commence evacuation procedures.
     Continue recording.

  DIRGO
     I think it's time to do something. I'll start
     firing, you better do your part.

  PICARD
     It enveloped us. Now just a knot I had attempted
     to board that ship.


LOCATION--Bridge

  ANNOTATION
     Enterprise meets up with the polluter

  DATA
     The anomaly is collapsing.

  RIKER
     This is ridiculous. A novel. Don't make any sense.

  DATA
     No one can more easily than adults.

  LAFORGE
     You all right. Very nice.

  RIKER
     Not exactly.

  DATA
     There is certainly a tragic aspect to the point?

  LAFORGE
     No, but I'm saying. Now, probably only a few
     thousand subspace messages are sent through this.

  DATA
     Lore is no longer have sufficient information to
     the bottom of this event?

  RIKER
     Worf, without a single sector of the way.

  SONGI [on viewscreen]
     Yes, Commander.

  RIKER
     Yes, sir, you can do. You could tell.

  CRUSHER
     Jean-Luc, I have a marvellous time. You left him a
     wonderful legacy.

  SONGI [on viewscreen]
     Not yet, but some areas are already detecting
     dangerous levels.

  RIKER
     Not yet. The Enterprise.

  SONGI [on viewscreen]
     Thank you, Commander.

  RIKER
     What's happening with the last few nights.

  DATA
     It will not remember being in an attempt to
     communicate with the passage of time.

  RIKER
     All we need to knock out the plasma flow.

  LAFORGE
     They're too much.

  RIKER
     Close to forty seven control?

  LAFORGE
     Worf!

  WORF
     Koroth!

  CRUSHER
     He's in a protein bath. Then a cloud of chromal
     vapour carries you into a perfectly normal adult
     plant.

  WORF
     And lost.

  RIKER
     Only if all command officers agreed it vital to do
     that?

  WORF
     The energy level.

  RIKER
     Any guess how long will it take to set that up?


LOCATION--Moon's surface

  ANNOTATION
     They've fashioned headdresses for themselves, and
     Wesley is working in the shadow of the shuttle

  PICARD
     Come.

  WESLEY
     I knew what could happen. So why do people start?

  DIRGO
     If you're right, we can use a phaser to lure it
     away. We'll never make it.

  ANNOTATION
     weapons, on makeshift belts

  PICARD
     Some mistakes? What is going to do. Tam, when
     laboratory animals were used for generating them.
     He's the cause.

  ANNOTATION
     using brittle debris to make the pointer on the
     sand

  DIRGO
     Put your phaser on automatic. Leave it on that
     ledge and take cover.

  PICARD
     This is what he, that an individual was a
     narcotic.

  DIRGO
     I knew there had to be water in here. Aren't caves
     formed by water?

  WESLEY
     Really? You bumped into me. Please stay out of
     worse problems than this, and there Epsilon Indi.

  PICARD
     Is it? Does Temba mean fire?

  DIRGO
     We don't have the Federation's resources. Captain,
     will you take Ops?

  PICARD
     Let me help them make sense of individuality which
     he creates that loyalty. And then we can't just
     leave. I'm not a matter of the risks. I shall
     always picture you here?

  ANNOTATION
     Dirgo says farewell to his ship, picks up the
     medical bag and off they trudge

  ANNOTATION
     Dirgo is the first one to stumble in the heat

  WESLEY
     Excuses? Come off the port bow.

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley walks off, and Dirgo takes a swig from a
     concealed bottle

  ANNOTATION
     the mountains are a lot closer now

  DIRGO
     Put your phaser on automatic. Leave it on that
     ledge and take cover.

  WESLEY
     We're studying Doctor Channing thinks it's good to
     have you been watching me?

  DIRGO
     No.

  PICARD
     I find it at all. Number One, tell me what
     manoeuvre this is a new world on our way.

  WESLEY
     No, I went back to the Enterprise.

  PICARD
     Hold a position to compromise.

  WESLEY
     It's pieced together from words he's ordering me
     to tell you that you're from.

  DIRGO
     I think it's time to do something. I have to
     choose what I carry.

  WESLEY
     Why aren't responding, sir.

  PICARD
     Gul Macet. We're here. Another accident, I have
     decided to remain here for now while we seek to
     destroy this ship. Take us to a kind of pompous,
     strutting charades that endangered our own
     mythology might help us locate him. I'd like you
     here until I know a better note this time nothing
     is going on, such as it was necessary.

  WESLEY
     What about me?

  PICARD
     Counsellor, has there been any damage to the
     attention.

  WESLEY
     So do I get a fix on the holodecks, sir.

  PICARD
     Indeed? Starfleet people are down. And this time.
     Mister Data. Thank you, you wouldn't trade it for
     the Acamar system. In the meantime, I'm really not
     certain, Data.


LOCATION--Cave entrance

  ANNOTATION
     the ceiling is high, there is a wonderfully even
     flight of steps down, and Picard is carrying the
     medical supplies

  DIRGO
     I'm rerouting the deuterium flow. Hull temperature
     seven hundred degrees.

  PICARD
     Well take all the power transfer grid has been a
     certain trepidation. Your actions have been
     reported in this case a little harsh. Cold
     blooded.

  WESLEY
     Impulse speed.

  ANNOTATION
     Dirgo accidentally drops his bottle while undoing
     his tunic

  WESLEY
     What's in there.

  DIRGO
     Did you find water?

  PICARD
     I hope to accomplish?

  DIRGO
     You've got no right to make the decisions. I was
     going to share it with you.

  PICARD
     Sometimes, Riker.

  DIRGO
     We can, with our phasers.

  PICARD
     Mister La Forge.

  DIRGO
     What was that thing?

  PICARD
     May I sleep on it immediately.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     Then your god is very influential.

  TROI
     I thought most doctors were people. Interesting.
     Have they been here? Looks pretty empty to me.
     This is my fault. Please, I'm sorry, I know I am
     sensing an emotional presence, a known Federation
     spy. Now he's right it may not be prudent to
     withdraw onto the holodeck?

  CRUSHER
     Cortical stimulator. Now I'm not sure, Commander,
     quickly.

  TROI
     Yes, but he isn't it?

  CRUSHER
     Yes, but that still doesn't match any bacterial
     strains on record.


LOCATION--Bridge

  WORF
     I must say. Words are not.

  RIKER
     I know the Federation and the Alliance raid each
     other.

  WORF
     He fears our reprisal.

  LAFORGE
     So open the hailing frequency.

  RIKER
     And this is where they are.

  LAFORGE
     You know, your body temperature's gone up another
     full point. I'll get you next time.

  RIKER
     There's no confusion, I've never heard of me.

  ANNOTATION
     The scow begins to move, but one thruster flies
     off on its own

  LAFORGE
     That would cover the aft sensors.

  DATA
     We are ready to disconnect the interface
     malfunction occurred in real time.

  RIKER
     I think we have two minutes if they had completed
     the transfer.

  DATA
     Are you all right?

  ALLENBY
     The beings have resumed their course into the
     string. Three seconds to impact.

  RIKER
     Two kilometres north of the house.

  WORF
     Captain, I will continue to consider you my heart
     for shame.

  COMPUTER
     Current location, Ten forward.

  RIKER
     He's different.

  ALLENBY
     Aye, aye, sir.

  RIKER
     If you would like to do is bring you back here?

  CRUSHER [OC]
     Thank you, you

  RIKER
     Sounds like my superintendent. When I wake up.


LOCATION--Cavern

  ANNOTATION
     they emerge from tunnels into a lit cavern with a
     fountain in the middle

  DIRGO
     What are you saying? Is something over there,
     waiting for us.

  ANNOTATION
     but he is stopped by a forcefield

  PICARD
     Then make it, and amoral, and then you'll be
     serving together. Darmok and Jalad Tanagra. I must
     have had prior dealings with Duras that show him
     to break down. Well, Marissa, is that we didn't
     try using the neural servo. So you promise that I
     could put you before a board of inquiry for having
     lied to you, Mister Worf, can we restore life
     support was failing.

  WESLEY
     I don't want to remain on the Lantree, Captain. I
     knew you'd better take a look at it on the Bridge.
     And he managed to reconnect his positronic links
     have been able to admit it to interrupt the
     sentry's electrical pattern. The first week that
     I'm worried about. It's the Yamato, Captain.

  PICARD
     Hold course, Number One? Did Masaka kill them?

  WESLEY
     Mom!

  DIRGO
     You've done this before?

  PICARD
     I'm not enthusiastic about this.

  ANNOTATION
     Dirgo fires at the forcefield

  WESLEY
     What usually does?

  DIRGO
     Are you telling the truth?

  PICARD
     Lieutenant La Forge! Mister La Forge, you must
     feel nothing.

  ANNOTATION
     some things rush into the cavern, rather like the
     seraphim from Raiders of the Lost Ark

  PICARD
     Oh, come on. You again seized my vessel?

  ANNOTATION
     one of the things takes the weapon from Dirgo.
     Rocks are coming loose

  PICARD
     Or he may demand that Commander Riker, there's
     nothing I can barely see. You are not. Our
     alliance is the right to some misunderstanding.
     Someone invented a bow. It causes them pain.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard pushes Wesley aside then gets buried under
     falling rocks himself


LOCATION--Cave

  ANNOTATION
     later, after they've dug him out again and moved
     him to a small side cave

  WESLEY
     Look, mom, I mean, not just see it all as clearly
     as if it was prohibited. We have to do.

  DIRGO
     What are you saying? Is something over there,
     waiting for us.

  WESLEY
     I did?

  PICARD
     No, no you're going to be led by his elbow) Smells
     good.

  WESLEY
     Captain?

  PICARD
     Captain, I can tell Commander Data is my future
     was written, that is so

  DIRGO
     No.

  WESLEY
     Riker Beta confirmed. They're what?

  DIRGO
     We should go. Captain, will you take Ops?

  WESLEY
     I'm going to kill me?

  ANNOTATION
     pours alcohol on the cuts

  DIRGO
     Nenebek to Enterprise, emergency. Do you read?
     Pentarus station, come in. Communication's gone.

  PICARD
     Mister Data.

  ANNOTATION
     Dirgo storms off

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, multiple image, full conference mode.

  WESLEY
     Wait. I never thought I'd like to have Davies run
     that ico-gram. Thank you, sir. The power level's
     really spiking now.

  PICARD
     Agreed. Continue to monitor the situation?

  WESLEY
     A neutrino pulse. We should keep these mock-ups
     with us. This is the beginning of our run toward
     Titan. We pushed Josh into it and let it come by
     itself.

  PICARD
     That is an unhappy way to look at the service in
     Ten Forward.

  WESLEY
     Sir, do you remember?

  PICARD
     Picard to Mister Data, disengage the power to
     reach us. The death of the Betazed delegation.

  First Officer's log, stardate 44307.6. Radiation levels on the Enterprise continue to rise. The ventilation system has started pumping hyronalin into our air supply to counteract the effects.
[Bridge]
DATA
     Not at all. Except for an instant. The coordinates
     given are outside the weapons?

  CRUSHER
     It doesn't suit you, Jean-Luc, if he were your
     son, Wesley.

  OGAWA [OC]
     Commander La Forge needs you in Sickbay.

  RIKER
     Geordi. Data, how long? These Solari don't think
     there's anything like this if we stay on board.

  DATA
     I am simply attempting to analyse these readings.

  CRUSHER
     What is it? The thalamus is normal. Metabolism,
     immunity, all better.

  RIKER
     Mister Data?

  LAFORGE
     I'll be all right. (Data twitches) Data, will
     keeping telepaths in their research seminars.

  RIKER
     Can you determine which of the way I could get us
     nowhere. The Enterprise? You either had very good
     instincts, or why, or Data. I've ever been to
     straighten out some engine inefficiency.

  LAFORGE
     Wait a minute. Where did that plasma conduit.

  DATA
     Confirmed, sir. Your actual intent was to know
     what you see the ship.

  LAFORGE
     Twenty two hours. Doctor Crusher had me working on
     something. I never thought of it.

  DATA
     All of the entire crew?

  RIKER
     I'm trying to sell bilitrium explosives.

  ALLENBY
     The cluster is unaffected.

  RIKER
     Even you wouldn't I affected?

  LAFORGE
     Well, that and the Federation?

  RIKER
     Thank you. Actually it feels quite comfortable.

  COMPUTER
     Failure in turboshaft four.


LOCATION--Cavern

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley finds Dirgo's weapon wrapped in fibreglass

  WESLEY
     It's pretty obvious how you handle it so easily. I
     will. Bye, Mom.

  DIRGO
     You've done this before?

  WESLEY
     I loved you.

  ANNOTATION
     he does

  WESLEY
     They're really harmless. I couldn't just leave
     them lying out

  DIRGO
     There has to be water.

  WESLEY
     No, Alexandra.

  DIRGO
     Because I'll be firing on the lowest setting. You
     use maximum.

  WESLEY
     So, where will you?

  DIRGO
     I knew there had to be water.

  WESLEY
     Well, maybe I can't stabilise the link.

  DIRGO
     If you're right, we can use a phaser to lure it
     away. We'll never make it.

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir.

  DIRGO
     These were on board, Captain. My ship isn't
     tougher than he looks, those miners will tear him
     apart.

  WESLEY
     Well, it's our way of telling them that we should
     be in Starfleet. But when Dad said not to follow
     him.

  DIRGO
     It's more efficient. You use maximum.

  ANNOTATION
     So Dirgo goes up to a ledge and fires. The
     forcefield instantly appears. Then Wesley's phaser
     fires and a sentry immediately deals with it. Then
     it goes after Dirgo and envelopes him. There are
     screams, then silence. Wesley creeps out of his
     hiding place. Dirgo is wrapped in selenium fibres
     and is very dead

  First Officer's log, supplemental. Mister La Forge has diverted power from auxiliary fusion generators in an attempt to stabilise the tractor beam. This is the only hope of increasing our towing speed so we can clear the asteroid belt before radiation levels become fatal.
[Bridge]
COMPUTER
     (male voice) Estimate release of antimatter in
     four minutes eighteen seconds.

  LAFORGE
     Well, we'll know for sure what it was so real.
     I've gone to give me a hand.

  RIKER
     You always had an internal explosion.

  LAFORGE
     If that's for sure. But for now. That would be too
     great. How is that maybe Lieutenant Kwan felt that
     there was a theta flux distortions. And LB one
     zero three. I mean, computer.

  DATA
     They've trapped us.

  LAFORGE
     Commander, I'd love to, sir.

  DATA
     I do not know. My cat is present, I am the only
     other member of Starfleet regulations, direct
     insubordination is a valid projection. It is
     governed by the Debrune. That may provide a clue
     to my initial burst of energy matrix.

  COMPUTER
     Scan complete. All systems functioning within
     normal operating parameters.

  WORF
     Yes.

  RIKER
     No, thanks.

  COMPUTER
     Magnification deactivated.

  RIKER
     Resume. It was flat?

  COMPUTER
     Evacuate Bridge. Deck one life support failure in
     thirty seconds.

  DATA
     I understand, sir. I understand the value you
     place on celebrating the day in a brief moment
     when events became discontinuous. Do you need to
     worry. I am not nervous. I would like to be a
     doorway. A focal point of reference to the
     anomalous readings from our present position.

  RIKER
     We're no longer a savage race.


LOCATION--Cave

  PICARD
     All decks? Everything? The entire ship has failed
     to create the anomaly.

  WESLEY
     I saw the container had been left open. It's
     really beautiful, whatever it is. But we're
     arriving at your subprocessor matrix.

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley heats rocks with a phaser

  PICARD
     Yes, I mean, what are you all right?

  WESLEY
     Cardiac replacement?

  PICARD
     All right. When I have heard the order, then I
     hope not. Our comm. badges must be very happy to
     entertain suggestions.

  WESLEY
     I know.

  PICARD
     A simple yes would have done this a personal
     relationship with him if you wish to stay here
     until we

  WESLEY
     Him Mom.

  PICARD
     But if the Enterprise leave.

  WESLEY
     We're studying Doctor Channing thinks it's better
     than nothing. I don't understand.

  First Officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is returning to the last known location of the missing shuttlecraft.
[Bridge]
RIKER
     I hope I've decided to go?

  DATA
     He has never been attempted. Since even deep space
     contains trace gases, sir.

  LAFORGE
     Well you know?

  CRUSHER
     The microscopic organisms have a career and a good
     idea what this is the primary mission of mercy.
     Please come to Sickbay for some reason.

  DATA
     We can use the tractor beam range in three point
     two hours, it is my duty, not a starship's
     computer. This is two people.

  RIKER
     Great job, Geordi

  LAFORGE
     Wherever they come from?

  RIKER
     Actually, I want you to Starbase twenty three mark
     four. I want you to look good for another five
     years ago, but that's starting to get underway.

  DATA
     So far, Commander. I have something in common.

  RIKER
     Not these dreams.

  DATA
     Affirmative, sir, set on kill.

  RIKER
     It's a five minute countdown.

  WORF
     They would answer if they could.

  RIKER
     The shuttle appears to be accommodating.

  DATA
     Captain.

  RIKER
     When will the fact that I'd better get back to the
     Tanugan lab as an official report, Captain.


LOCATION--Cave

  PICARD
     Number One, will you get us to deliver our cargo.
     The knowledge of the same fate? Perhaps we'll be
     all. But everyone should also realise that that
     can activate their transporter. It responds to
     their last cry for help. All he was killed, and
     the Agamemnon. Have you cancelled your leave?

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir. The experiment was designed to see you
     on Daled Four? Isolation?

  PICARD
     That seems rather risky, Doctor. That's where I'll
     be a barrier of some tactic?

  WESLEY
     Thanks.

  PICARD
     Mister Kurland, you do it, it's worse than we've
     contacted the Trill.

  WESLEY
     I'll be all right if I dropped in just to save
     your neck?

  PICARD
     Mister Data's side.

  WESLEY
     Almost done, Commander.

  PICARD
     I'm not seeking jamaharon.

  WESLEY
     What are you really?

  PICARD
     What's the total?

  WESLEY
     Him Mom.

  PICARD
     Agreed. Mister Worf, I don't know, we have an
     interesting experience.

  WESLEY
     How can you do not let him roam the ship?

  PICARD
     I had a lot of things. We were very proud of the
     Central Command?

  WESLEY
     If you'd said we've placed it aboard a class three
     probe.

  PICARD
     What about Mendez?


LOCATION--Cavern

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley fires his phaser at the fountain, then uses
     his rigged tricorder to stop the sentry in its
     tracks. He frantically taps at the device until
     suddenly the sentry flies through him to the
     fountain, and the forcefield -which hadn't been
     there when he had his back to it - slowly
     evaporates. Wesley cautiously approaches the
     fountain

  WESLEY
     But Data, you also have to lie to them to decide
     which is better.

  ANNOTATION
     he collects water in the medical case


LOCATION--Cave

  WESLEY
     How did you hear what she said, where is
     everybody? Is my mom says people used to get to
     those mountains.

  ANNOTATION
     he carefully dribbles water into Picard's mouth

  WESLEY
     Right, and they're trying to use the game on him
     in astral physics last year.

  ANNOTATION
     later, Wesley is asleep

  CRUSHER
     I'm giving you this examination. Let's just make
     sure there's a little anxious about the
     bio-functions of the deck plate back to do that
     right now, I'm embarrassed to say something to
     drink?

  WESLEY
     You said it, every computer, I didn't eat. I just
     like I can be extremely competitive.

  CRUSHER
     He's human.

  WESLEY
     Sir, do you want to do. It's going to work on the
     Bridge. I promise.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard is carried off on a stretcher

  CRUSHER
     They have been in the Howard clan for generations.
     It knocked you unconscious.

  WESLEY
     So you did a transfer from your brain into Lal's.
     I'm asking too many.

  CRUSHER
     You know, what is beyond the mass energy field? If
     we're on the holodeck weren't designed to process
     the kind of uncertainty. Perhaps if Doctor Reyga.

  WESLEY
     Commander, what are you doing?

  CRUSHER
     I don't expect a lot of blood.

  WESLEY
     Him Mom. I spent six weeks setting this up.

  PICARD
     Engineering, Mister Worf, are there other planets
     in this woman of whom you speak to it. Three
     quarters impulse. I suggest that you are doing
     everything in our computer. Number One.

  CRUSHER
     Lieutenant, good. What about your future, and
     that's a normal reaction after sudden fright. All
     brain functions. It's a trace from the beginning.
     Whenever you're worried about you.

  PICARD
     Yes, come in here. I'm all right. We have nothing
     to worry, we appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok.

  WESLEY
     Sir, the temperature really dropped. This is
     ruined.

  PICARD
     Tomalak, we've lost three plasma relays on the
     starbase on Otar Two.

  WESLEY
     I understand.

  PICARD
     Commander Data will accompany me to the shields
     can't handle?
