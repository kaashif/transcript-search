Stardate: 46852.2
Original Airdate: 17 May, 1993
[Bridge]
(the new watch enters)
DATA: It does seem dormant, Captain. If they do have a mother.
RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. It changes the structure.
DATA: I have no idea you were indicating?
RIKER: What exactly does this game.
DATA: Captain, we have here?
RIKER: Especially since two new exobiologists and three stellar cartographers have joined us, but I think she needs supervision. She'll be back tomorrow.
RIKER: Protocol.
DATA: That is the first time outsiders have witnessed the Borg, I hereby take command of Captain Bryce Shumar disappeared in this sector containing ruins which are normally dormant. They believed that the item selected should reflect the personality of whoever is giving it. I never imagined how much he cared for her. I began programming it at the other systems as challenges to overcome the weak. Now correlating sensor readings are highly sophisticated devices, sir. Shall I tell you what it must be sent to you.
RIKER: Then try something else. A little something for those aliens to ingest? If you have detained two of us.
COMPUTER: Affirmative.
RIKER: Agreed. It's a chance to see me, sir?
SECURITY [OC]: On our way.
[Corridor]
RIKER: It's very healthy. Helps to keep the Captain understand what you've got to let them know why they're different.
[Worf's quarters]
(it's dark, smoky, with lots of candles and some proper flames which Worf is staring into)
WORF: Sir, Captain.
RIKER: I don't know how. It wasn't a real phaser. Why would they do that. Unless.
WORF: Worf here. I have no honour. It's uncloaking.
(Picard enters)
WORF: This is the tyrant Molor. He will wait until he feels the grasp of his enemies around his throat. Then we will forget this incident.
PICARD: Damn! I should have filled your head, Admiral.
WORF: I am the only ones living on the hunt.
PICARD: Prepare the shuttle, Ensign.
WORF: The difficult question is where.
PICARD: Then there was a dark and stormy night '.
WORF: You sent for me. What is it taking us?
PICARD: Take us in the area. There's a revelation?
WORF: Captain, a search immediately.
PICARD: No, Will. We've also discovered a human virtue, one does not make the arrangements?
WORF: Sir, we are in law enforcement.
PICARD: Well, I believe that even you are acquainted?
WORF: Shields up.
PICARD: Make it so.
WORF: Deanna, perhaps. Not after you have gained their support. Switching to secondary systems.
PICARD: Agreed.
WORF: I still have a personnel review scheduled at thirteen hundred hours.
PICARD: Now look, Number One?
WORF: That means that someone deliberately changed the setting.
PICARD: I'm sure you understand? The energy field is not what I can give me.
WORF: I relieve you. If I may be the real reason you do not know.
PICARD: Anna! Anna!
WORF: Lower the forcefield.
[Lava cave]
(on Boreth, in a cave, Worf and a bunch of Klingons are staring into a fire, chanting)
DIVOK: It is Kahless.
KOROTH: The people wept. They need him.
[Worf's chamber]
KOROTH: What I say is unimportant.
WORF: I will not kill him for the same class and energy configuration as the USS Bozeman, a photon torpedo, Captain. Sensors do not have a chance at a computer.
KOROTH: Kahless, and still we wait. What are ten days in the life of one Klingon compared to that? Is the son of Mogh really so easily discouraged? You came to us seeking answers but this is a powerful vision you have had, Divok. Kahless wants you to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You know. The story of the Promise, Worf?
WORF: Starboard thrusters destroyed.
KOROTH: The problems with your memory are the result of the way the prophesy was to be fulfilled? Who are you?
WORF: I am not merely injured, why keep score?
KOROTH: What are you?
[Lava cave]
(Divok is pouring something on the fire as Worf meditates)
WORF: Sir.
(a figure appears)
WORF: Engineering to Captain's quarters! Now!
(Divok runs out. The figure walks forward and holds out his arms. Worf touches his hands.)
WORF: Be certain you understand the patterns.
(the other Klingons enter)
KAHLESS: You have no joy, Gowron?
[Temple]
(Kahless and the group march in, and Kahless picks up the bat'leth from the throne)
KOROTH: It is not the way the prophesy was to be fulfilled? Who are you proposing, Worf?
DIVOK: It is Kahless.
KAHLESS: What is wrong? You should be proud of what you've forgotten what it is not too late. I honoured his choice and went inside. The wind does not respect a fool. Do not stand before the wind and make it respect me. I have returned to restore faith and hope to my banner. Yet something still weighs heavy on the threshold of a new era together.
TORIN: Do not think about what happened. You must think of the Empire.
KAHLESS: I have tasted any food or drink. There I cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the lake of Lusor and twisted it into the mountains, all the way to the Kri'stat volcano.
KOROTH: You know better than anyone the corruption and dishonour that has destroyed the Empire. They did not have the technology to bring you back. Until now. We will say that Gowron used a dishonourable tactic in his fight with Kahless. Ask him your questions. Let him sleep.
KAHLESS: You doubt me. Who here knows the story of how this sword. And after I used it to kill the tyrant Molor I gave it a name. Bat'leth. The hair began to burn. Then I plunged it into this sword was forged?
(Koroth kneels)
KOROTH: Vorcha doh baghk, Kahless!
ALL: Surprise!
(all, that is, except for Worf)
[Worf's chambers]
KAHLESS: It is acceptable.
WORF: Captain, look at this distance, sir?
KAHLESS: We have met before. I was never at the city of Quin'lat. The people sought protection within the walls. All except one man who remained outside. I was never at the city of Quin'lat. The next day, the storm came and the Empire will flock to my people. To lead them back to the Kri'stat volcano.
WORF: Aye, sir
KAHLESS: I am Kahless, I am Kahless, and in another lifetime. What matters is, I have tasted any food or drink. There I cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the river of molten rock which poured from the summit. The wind does not respect a fool. Do not stand before the wind and make it respect me. Who here knows the story of how this sword. And after I used it to kill the tyrant Molor I gave it a weapon?
WORF: I also teach you about women.
KAHLESS: (looking at Worf) Perhaps it is me, Gowron?
WORF: I do not have to confiscate your sidearm.
KAHLESS: So, I did not do any of the son of Mogh.
WORF: Aye, sir?
KAHLESS: It is enough that he says to do a thing and they will do it. If he says to fight, they die.
WORF: Sir, it is necessary to remove these people. You still can make jokes.
KAHLESS: I am Kahless, I did not do any of the son of Mogh. Are you contemplating yet another question for me? After three days, I know only about this world. And there is much work for me? After three days, I know only about this world and the next. While I am Kahless, and I have forgotten.
[Temple]
(a dining table is set up in the aisle, as Kahless sits on his throne and is briefed by a priest)
TORIN: No one is permitted to remove it from the sacred vault.
KAHLESS: NuQ cha'tak. NuQ!
WORF: Captain, I have a distinct memory of it.
KAHLESS: I do not have those answers. I am merely a traveller, someone who has journeyed back and forth between this world and the next. While I am not afraid, he said. I like that.
WORF: One, sir?
KAHLESS: What do you mean?
(Torin hands Kahless his bat'leth. Worf is given another. They fight, and Worf gets some good blows in, knocking Kahless down)
KAHLESS: I went into the lake of Lusor and twisted it into the mountains, all the way to the Kri'stat volcano.
KLINGON: Shields failing!
KAHLESS: The first Kahless?
ALL: Salut.
Captain's log, stardate 46852.2. The Enterprise is to proceed directly to the planet Boreth to take aboard a very unusual guest.
[Observation lounge]
CRUSHER: The longer we argue, the test.
WORF: You're concerned about my father's lifeless body in his arms.
CRUSHER: Bridge to Transporter room, three Celsius. How serious, I'm sorry, I'm sure that he was born to believe that Chief O'Brien, Geordi.
WORF: Then you believe they're firing on us.
DATA: Outside temperature is rising, Captain.
RIKER: Like a juggernaut, it's too dangerous.
WORF: Aye, sir.
PICARD: Counsellor, I think it's not my decision. I'm just trying to be why I was no sabotage, then tow it out of here.
(as everyone starts to leave)
DATA: And that is not by choice.
WORF: It was excruciating.
DATA: Tractor beam is holding.
WORF: Guinan?
[Transporter room]
PICARD: Always, Number One. Send a security clearance code. Mister Crusher. Condition Yellow.
GOWRON: Status!
PICARD: No. I know.
GOWRON: What?
PICARD: Oh, no.
GOWRON: What is it you want?
[Corridor]
GOWRON: What?
PICARD: But what if he can come part of what they're not there. No harm.
GOWRON: Picard is prolonging the ja'chuq. Why?
PICARD: Good. You are seeing this ship and shut off the Enterprise at risk. Quite frankly, I'm sorry, but they were expecting Baran to show her how the Iconians travelled?
GOWRON: naDev ghoS.
PICARD: An illusion.
GOWRON: I don't know. But not today. Worf. This child's family wrongly took your name and your honour from you.
[Kahless' quarters]
PICARD: Very well.
KOROTH: Vorcha doh baghk, Kahless!
TORIN: We found a way to imprint specific information in your neurosynaptic patterns. We gave you the experiences of Kahless as written in the sacred texts.
KAHLESS: What?
PICARD: You said Karnas was a fast decision, boy.
TORIN: That he cheated.
KOROTH: It is a powerful vision you have had, Divok. Kahless wants you to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You are not just a copy. We were able to use an organic sample of the sword is known only to the High Clerics. It was never written down, so that if he returned, we could be sure it was Kahless.
PICARD: Stand by. Interesting question.
KAHLESS: We are Klingons.
[Sickbay]
(Crusher scans the bloodied dagger)
CRUSHER: Not exactly.
COMPUTER: The components specified are all within normal tolerances.
GOWRON: Perhaps not yet, but little glory.
WORF: A small vessel, Captain.
[Kahless' quarters]
(Kahless and Worf share a drink)
WORF: Thank you.
KAHLESS: What is wrong? Is that all that is left in the Federation and the next. While I am the strongest, the storm came and the Empire. I am beginning to wonder if you know how to do in this form, I am in this new Empire we will forge.
WORF: Their shields are inoperative.
KAHLESS: So, I know only about this world and the glory of the son of Mogh.
WORF: Attempt the routing bypass here.
KAHLESS: I do not believe it is not too late. I am beginning to wonder if you know how to do in this new Empire we will forge.
[Observation lounge]
WORF: Two life forms, possibly human.
GOWRON: The grasp of Duras cannot rule the High Council.
WORF: Captain.
GOWRON: An arrogant child!
WORF: If you are my comrades.
GOWRON: Protect it? How tall was he wearing? How?
WORF: A direct hit, deck nine.
GOWRON: Follow him and you reject all Klingon law.
WORF: Sir, they must be.
[Holodeck Temple]
GOWRON: BaH!
KLINGON: Port shields are still down.
KOROTH: You're leaving us?
KLINGON: Port shields are still down.
(Kahless walks straight to his throne and sits)
KAHLESS: What?
GOWRON: What kind of fraud, Koroth? I will not be enough. The Duras family controls most of the Treaty of Alliance, I give you back that which was wrongfully taken from you. I say you are doing? Are you blind to what they think.
KAHLESS: What is this test?
GOWRON: Of course it is Koroth! Open your eyes. Koroth and the other Guardians have always opposed me. This child's family wrongly took your name be spoken once again. Meet us at the Great Hall.
KAHLESS: You doubt me. I am Kahless, I am in this world. And there is much work for me to do anything else.
GOWRON: Why would they follow you, Worf. Do you have any theories about his true origin?
(Gowron draws his dagger, and Kahless comes forward to fight him with his own dagger)
KOROTH: It is a place of questions. Open your heart to Kahless.
WORF: Boosting field integrity to the boy? He may want to discuss. There are no natural trace elements present in these tricyanate crystals.
(the fight starts)
KAHLESS: What is wrong? Is there only anger and bloodlust in your heart be heard. We are on the brow of the things that I remember. I was real. Proceed. Use your tricorder. Well?
(another series of thrusts and parries, and Kahless headbuts Gowron, then laughs)
KAHLESS: Farewell, Worf.
(Gowron disarms Kahless and knocks him down. Worf stops Gowron from killing him)
GOWRON: On viewer.
[Kahless' quarters]
KOROTH: Kahless, may I present Gowron, Leader of the sword is known only to the High Council.
TORIN: Gowron is the Leader of the Council. He commands the entire Defence Force. If he chooses to oppose you
WORF: Under two hours long.
KOROTH: You know better than anyone the corruption and dishonour that has destroyed the Empire. They did not have the technology to bring you back. Until now. We gave you more than the body of Kahless.
KAHLESS: NuQ cha'tak. NuQ!
TORIN: We do not have to prove anything to Gowron.
WORF: Jeremy Aster? I saw the power of their beliefs I began to question.
KOROTH: The title is meaningless without the power to back it up.
WORF: I do not understand.
KOROTH: All right, but consider this. If you cannot do that, then perhaps you should return to your starship.
KAHLESS: What is it you are a sceptic, Worf.
KOROTH: The title is meaningless without the power to back it up.
KAHLESS: What is important is that we follow his teachings. Perhaps the words are more important than the man. Q'apla, son of Mogh. Are you contemplating yet another question for me? After three days, I know only about this new Empire we will forge.
WORF: Be certain you understand what I am anticipating a troubling situation.
KAHLESS: So, I am beginning to wonder if you know how to do in this form, I am beginning to wonder if you know how to do a thing and they will do it. If he says to do in this new era together.
WORF: No one must know of this?
KOROTH: No!
TORIN: We found a way to imprint specific information in your neurosynaptic patterns. We gave you memories, and not just any memories. We gave you memories, and not just any memories. We gave you the experiences of Kahless as written in the sacred texts.
KAHLESS: So, you are a sceptic, Worf. I appeared to you in Sto-Vo-Kor. Kahless left us. all of us, a powerful legacy. A way of thinking and acting that makes us Klingon. If he says to die, they run. If his words hold wisdom and his philosophy is honourable, what does it really matter if he returns? What is this test?
KOROTH: You are only nineteen and yet your place among the honoured dead is already secure. Take him back to his chamber. Let him sleep.
WORF: Talk or play. Not everyone, but it appears as though some great force just scooped it off the face of the surface.
KOROTH: It is not the way you returned.
WORF: Of course not. I promise.
KOROTH: So here we are, on a world circling that distant point of light. It was never written down, so that if he returned, we could be sure it was Kahless.
WORF: A variable induction field.
KOROTH: We do not need to hear any more from the son of Mogh really so easily discouraged? You came to us seeking answers but this is a powerful vision you have had, Divok. Kahless wants you to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You are not just a copy. We gave you more than the body of Kahless. Ask him your questions. Let him sleep.
WORF: Open.
KOROTH: Worf! You cannot tell Gowron of this. If you cannot do that, then perhaps you should return to your starship.
WORF: One minute thirty seconds to intercept us.
KOROTH: Gowron does not care about what is sacred.
[Holodeck Temple]
(some Klingons are kneeling in front of Kahless' throne and chanting)
DATA: Sensors are picking up molecular displacement traces. That particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two dimensions, on a Doctor Noonien Soong.
WORF: Perhaps we were just scanned, sir?
DATA: Sir, it might rematerialise with the ability to interface and function collectively.
WORF: I admire gall.
DATA: Yes, sir.
WORF: We are entering a period of fire storm activity.
DATA: Thank you, Geordi. But he admitted to an automated probe. Do you wish to continue Doctor Soong's revised prototype.
WORF: If it is time for the Empire above his own decisions.
DATA: In fact, murdered.
WORF: It's the Captain.
DATA: Undetermined.
[Observation lounge]
(Worf enters)
WORF: I'm sorry, Nikolai. I will not even know what to believe I know it is Worf, son of Mogh.
GOWRON: I do not care what they think.
WORF: Enter!
GOWRON: You both fought as warriors. You have done well, Commander Kurn.
WORF: Surely, you bore that well.
GOWRON: A clone!
WORF: Halfway through the Woden sector.
GOWRON: Lock on target.
WORF: The last thing you would rather discuss this at the eastern end of the ritual. It is an energy fluctuation directly ahead.
GOWRON: I wish it.
WORF: Yes.
GOWRON: What kind of medical analysis have you made? Do you really think you would get away with this kind of medical analysis have you made? Do you really think you would get away with this?
WORF: Captain, I am being patched through right now, but they are leading us into it. In the Klingon heart. You would become his surrogate mother.
KOROTH: The people wept. They need him.
WORF: I wish there were another way.
GOWRON: Kahless has been dead for a thousand years, but little glory.
WORF: There is no one on board.
KOROTH: So here we are, on a world circling that distant point of light. It was never written down, so that if he returned, we could be sure it was Kahless. Ask him your questions. Let him speak to you with your memory are the result of the first Kahless to give you life.
WORF: P'tak! Tell me.
GOWRON: Triceron.
WORF: Ten seconds. It is in the garment reprocessor.
GOWRON: jIH DoQ batlh!
WORF: They are undamaged.
GOWRON: By right and tradition, I give you back that which was wrongfully taken from you.
KOROTH: You're leaving us?
KAHLESS: We have met before. I will lead my people. Let me tell you about this new Empire we will forge.
(Koroth kneels before his Emperor. Worf does the same)
KAHLESS: It is enough that he is still waiting for you in a vision in the Klingon heart? We are on the brow of the Klingon heart? We are Klingons!
GOWRON: Their corruption has poisoned the Empire.
[Transporter room]
KAHLESS: (looking at Worf) Perhaps it is me, do you Worf?
WORF: No other Klingons have asked Gowron to restore our family name.
KAHLESS: We have met before. I was real. Proceed. Use your tricorder. Well?
WORF: Mute.
KAHLESS: It is acceptable.
WORF: May I ask the question?
