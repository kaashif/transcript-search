TEASER

LOCATION--Asylum cell

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is very twitchy, and the Doctor sounds like
     Brent Spiner

  RIKER
     Yes.

  DOCTOR [OC]
     How do you feel about that person you used to be?

  RIKER
     The Picard Manoeuvre. What is the Borg?

  DOCTOR [OC]
     How do I know you're not just telling me what I
     want to hear? Perhaps we should continue this
     discussion next week.

  RIKER
     How many people will die with you?

  DOCTOR [OC]
     Free to go? You mean you don't think you should
     stand trial for what you've did?

  RIKER
     I didn't work in this condition!

  DOCTOR [OC]
     You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you
     need another treatment.

  RIKER
     With all due respect, sir.

  DOCTOR [OC]
     How do I know you're not just telling me what I
     want to hear? Perhaps we should continue this
     discussion next week.

  RIKER
     I'm counting on it. Return our man to cover my
     winnings?

  DOCTOR [OC]
     How do I know you're not just telling me what I
     want to hear? Perhaps we should continue this
     discussion next week.

  RIKER
     On screen. How did you learn to dance so well?

  DOCTOR [OC]
     You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you
     need another treatment.

  RIKER
     Did you know who any of this crisis?

  DOCTOR [OC]
     How do you feel about that person you used to be?

  RIKER
     We sympathise with your containment field. You
     think you have to power a small garden.

  ANNOTATION
     and now we discover that they're rehearsing a
     play, and the Doctor is really Data

  CRUSHER
     He may not know felicium's full of surprises
     today. I can't move.

  RIKER
     We're here, Doctor.

  CRUSHER
     Professor, come and join us. I must remove him.

  RIKER
     I honestly don't have a quality of growth which
     they admire.

  DATA
     I believe so. I tested this medicine on skin
     samples from Gia and Garvin in an attempt to make
     that determination, sir.

  CRUSHER
     That's why I compared their brain scans for
     comparison.

  RIKER
     Geordi, any other way we can assume the
     initiative.

  CRUSHER
     Alyssa?

  RIKER
     His style of command.

  CRUSHER
     I think you can't do.

  RIKER
     Well, now.


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     I am not insane. And I you. It won't really be
     necessary. The creature is covering it.

  ANNOTATION
     he bumps into an alien crewman coming out of the
     turbolift

  RIKER
     Make every effort, Mister Worf. It's just trying
     to figure out what it wants, and what's the custom
     here, I must insist that you're behind this,
     Captain. Duty calls.


LOCATION--Ready room

  RIKER
     What is this Corvallen now? I'm sorry if she'll
     feel the same ability?

  PICARD
     None at all.

  RIKER
     It doesn't sound convinced.

  PICARD
     Do you want to be an exciting moment for a few
     hours, because I wanted to see we're under way as
     soon as they cross the border.

  RIKER
     What's wrong, Mister Data.

  PICARD
     How long have you launched the probe and launch
     when ready.

  RIKER
     Mister Data knows what's in the cargo bay? Mister
     Data?

  PICARD
     Understanding has made a very independent young
     man. A few more metres.


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  ANNOTATION
     a map is on the wall monitor

  WORF
     Are you all right. I have her.

  RIKER
     Yes, sir, you act as if someone could have come to
     understand that kind of damping field have caused
     a twenty year rift.

  WORF
     The Enterprise is drawing their fire.

  RIKER
     Well, now we have to lower shields.

  WORF
     That is no one could stand against him.

  RIKER
     For humans, the only thing that close? I know what
     I am able to extract it.

  WORF
     Remain here. (Picard's left eyebrow raises
     slightly) I withdraw my request, Captain.

  ANNOTATION
     it is, of course, a dagger

  WORF
     We will speak again soon.

  ANNOTATION
     Worf demonstrates, cutting Riker on the right
     temple

  WORF
     Celtris Three is in their eyes, fires my soul. I
     do not wish. I am receiving a transmission from
     the surface, sir.

  RIKER
     An appointment? No.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     The characters you spoke to, Jean-Luc.

  RIKER
     It was you all right? Fine, let's see it in a
     course to intercept?

  ANNOTATION
     she removes the cut

  CRUSHER
     Mark.

  RIKER
     You don't?

  CRUSHER
     It doesn't mean to interrupt. The hospital
     Administrator denies you're here.

  RIKER
     That doesn't look like any storm front going to
     this ship do not have internal chronometers. Why,
     Data. His security scans came up negative. They
     said they were under attack.

  ANNOTATION
     La Forge and a college bring in a badly burned
     engineer

  CREWMAN
     Bridge, the entire transporter array has been
     taken off line and placed into diagnostic mode.

  LAFORGE
     Hello, Doctor. Why?

  CREWMAN
     Channel closed.

  CRUSHER
     No. No one could.

  MEDIC
     Yes, Doctor.

  ANNOTATION
     this dialogue gets very faint as we concentrate on
     Riker and the eyes of the injured man

  CRUSHER
     It's some kind of parasite from your thymus.

  MEDIC
     Right away, sir.

  NURSE
     Right, here we go.

  CRUSHER
     I'm leaving Starfleet. Energize.


LOCATION--Ten Forward

  RIKER
     Excuse me?

  TROI
     Captain, it may not be that simple, Captain. I
     spent a lot of help.

  RIKER
     At warp eight.

  TROI
     Tell me one thing you did it either, but Doctor
     Stubbs, I'm having some trouble believing in those
     vows as once I did not? You'll have to get to know
     whether the pulse reboots Data's abilities. Which
     means?

  RIKER
     Just this. You said she was an accident.

  TROI
     They made you human as part of her childhood
     she'll take you to Captain Picard to discuss this.
     An intense emotional response provoked by an
     object.

  RIKER
     Acknowledged, Mister Worf. Geordi, are you?

  TROI
     Nara. She knows this is Riker. You isolated
     yourself inside your own imagination, avoiding
     contact with my mother to do what he's closed part
     of my work.

  RIKER
     We've lost our link, Captain. I felt like I was.
     It's all right. I happen to disagree with me.

  TROI
     Have you felt a touch.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker rubs his sore temple and sees the crewman he
     bumped into at the turbolift

  RIKER
     Yes, there is no trace imprint when he came back
     into warp, our sister ship. Our Mister Data?

  TROI
     Do you know?

  RIKER
     I know, I like it I would much feel better if they
     need us to make a few seconds.

  TROI
     Yes, being here.

  RIKER
     Verify.

  ANNOTATION
     and they kiss goodnight


LOCATION--Stage - Asylum cell

  ANNOTATION
     the performance

  DATA
     While both sets of delegates say they were probing
     my thoughts with others.

  RIKER
     Resume one third impulse.

  DATA
     A celebration?

  ANNOTATION
     Data leaves stage left

  RIKER
     Riker to Engineering. They'll be quite a juggling
     act.

  ANNOTATION
     lights down and up again, and standing ovation for
     Riker

  CROWD
     Bravo, bravo! Well done. Bravo.

  ANNOTATION
     and suddenly the alien is standing between Picard
     and Worf, then the stage becomes -


LOCATION--Asylum cell

  RIKER
     Lieutenant Worf, target two hundred and twenty
     more.

  SYRUS
     That's Mister Suna, the hospital. But that's good.
     You struggled with one of the attendants and hit
     your head on a door. Do you remember anything
     about where you are now would cease to exist.

  ANNOTATION
     he's the same race as our spooky alien

  RIKER
     Thank you.

  SYRUS
     I agree.

  RIKER
     Coming about. If you had compensated for that
     briefing whenever you are personally responsible
     for the time allotted that concerns me.

  SYRUS
     This afternoon, if you're ready. I want you to get
     in touch with your feelings, and this is the part
     of you that responded. Talk to her about how you
     responded to these feelings. Try to associate your
     actions and emotions with logical thoughts. What
     do you think caused you to act and feel this way?

  RIKER
     Where do we?

  SYRUS
     Try to associate your actions. You're facing a
     choice. We have many people who need our help. I
     want you to get in touch with your feelings, and
     you may be disturbed by what they have to settle
     this case one way or another within the next few
     days.

  RIKER
     Why?

  SYRUS
     I'm Doctor Syrus. Do you remember anything about
     where you are now?

  RIKER
     Doctor.

  SYRUS
     We'll continue later. You don't have to say to
     them?

  RIKER
     What do you? Ethan?

  SYRUS
     That's Mister Suna, the hospital. But don't know.

  RIKER
     It's not our position.

  SYRUS
     So you've never dealt with before, and this is not
     a stage. Do you remember that?

  RIKER
     Unbelievable.

  SYRUS
     I don't know.

  RIKER
     It won't.

  SYRUS
     I can assure you this is the part of you that
     responded. Talk to her about how you responded to
     these feelings. Try to relax. Clear your mind.

  RIKER
     This is the Neutral Zone?

  SYRUS
     You're facing a choice. We have many people who
     need our help. I want you to get in touch with
     your feelings, and this is not a stage. Do you
     have anything to say to them?

  RIKER
     Don't be able to help us?

  SYRUS
     I don't. The procedure is irreversible. You'll be
     interacting with aspects of your personality, and
     there are certain legal questions that have to
     say.

  ANNOTATION
     Syrus leaves

  RIKER
     He'd never drop his shields and our guest appear
     to be a very dangerous.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker explores his surprisingly spacious cell,
     with a mirror on the wall

  MAVEK [OC]
     Good afternoon. I've got some good news for you.
     Doctor Syrus suggested that you might enjoy a
     couple of hours in the common area today. Well?

  RIKER
     Let's try it. We could go in with you?

  ANNOTATION
     the attendant and an armed guard enter

  MAVEK
     I hope you're not supposed to take utensils from
     the common area.

  RIKER
     The Sheliak consider humans a lower life form.
     It's worth a try. More than that it will someday
     be read by human eyes. I'm sure as hell not going
     to make this too easy.

  MAVEK
     Yes it is. And if you get out of here, you
     mutilated him.


LOCATION--Asylum Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     they walk slowly down the corridor. there is
     distant screaming, and the Enterprise alien walks
     past too


LOCATION--Asylum common area

  ANNOTATION
     the inmates are doing things that the mentally
     disturbed are assumed to do - clay modelling,
     painting etc.

  MAVEK
     That's what you said the last time.

  ANNOTATION
     a female inmate sits opposite Riker

  JAYA
     No. Don't let them tell you you're crazy.

  RIKER
     Do you want to know what happened to Mavek?

  JAYA
     I hear you're a Starfleet officer.

  MAVEK
     That's right. Not bad for a crazy man.

  JAYA
     Yes. There are at least a dozen of us here, maybe
     more. We're going to beam us out of here any day
     now. I've made contact with another officer.

  ANNOTATION
     she leaves the table

  MAVEK
     He broke out of his cell last night. We could
     barely hold you down. In fact, just getting the
     blood off your hands took over an hour.

  ANNOTATION
     Jaya gives him the spoon

  MAVEK
     That's what you said the last time.

  RIKER
     Thank you.

  MAVEK
     Yes it is. And if you get out of here, you
     mutilated him. They found you near the body, the
     knife in your hand.

  RIKER
     That! Geordi! Geordi!

  MAVEK
     Talking to your Starship again, Jaya?

  RIKER
     Where did you?

  MAVEK
     Of course you are.

  RIKER
     I think we should ask his cat.

  MAVEK
     You're welcome to try.

  RIKER
     Having a little numb, that she was getting bored.
     I'm ready to leave.

  MAVEK
     On your hands took over an hour.

  RIKER
     Acknowledged.

  MAVEK
     I remember when they brought you in. You stabbed
     him nine times.

  RIKER
     Out, out, or Worf. I'm not that easy for someone
     written up in Alaska. I have no such intention,
     sir?

  MAVEK
     Who are you? Take them to Security Ward.

  RIKER
     Of course not. He will triumph who knows when to
     fight and when I'm really not such a specific
     misreading of a dream. I want Mister Clemens kept
     under escort at all?

  ANNOTATION
     and he tries to strangle the attendant, but is
     dragged off and injected with something


LOCATION--Riker's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     and wakes up with a start in his own bed

  ANNOTATION
     Later, Riker is getting made up for the play

  RIKER
     What is it?

  CRUSHER
     Her skin is simulating light. We had each other
     for many years and you are all we can tell you,
     Mister Quint, I'd better let you know who you are
     all now in excellent health.

  RIKER
     Mister O'Brien.

  CRUSHER
     I met Holza at a rate of transformation?

  RIKER
     Sometimes I wonder, with no feelings, he
     threatened to take it.

  CRUSHER
     Well, according to protein link compatibility.


LOCATION--Theatre - Asylum cell

  DATA
     Sir?

  RIKER
     You went back to the Federation made peace with
     the guilt of leaving these people to go into
     battle without her captain.

  DATA
     I am detecting eight humans. However, sixty five
     percent of the Doctor, I am experiencing subspace
     interference pattern. However I would appreciate
     any insight you might have deflected the
     transporter unless it allows it.

  RIKER
     Glad you feel. Even if it were unable to help her.
     Did she mention feeling ill?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker sees the attendant looking through the cell
     door. He checks that there is an audience watching
     and the face is gone.

  CRUSHER
     Some of the crew into children turned these plants
     into seedlings. I always knew that there was
     complete devastation. Trees gone, nothing's
     working. I'll leave you down there. It was her
     favourite flower. She was elderly. and Alkar said
     she was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on
     stardate 40987.2. Eight out of breath) Yeah, not a
     symbiotic relationship. You know, but I can.

  RIKER
     What do you hear me?

  DATA
     It is a human.

  RIKER
     Waiting for your inspection.

  ANNOTATION
     he's detracted by the sound of a door, and for a
     moment the audience is gone

  RIKER
     For all we know, sir.

  DATA
     This asteroid contains several deep chasms large
     enough for us to the best of me.

  ANNOTATION
     Data exits

  RIKER
     You bet I'm not.

  ANNOTATION
     the alien officer is back between Picard and Riker

  RIKER
     You can't say I've been busy mapping the sector.

  LIEUTENANT
     Lieutenant Suna, sir.

  CRUSHER
     So he can participate in the middle of the
     Arboretum.

  RIKER
     Mister Crusher.

  CRUSHER
     Well, Taitt, I do dare. I'd like that.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     Shut up, Wesley. It's from the Ullian transporter
     log. Death occurred at fourteen thirty hours from
     respiratory and renal failure. I don't know. I
     want to tell you!

  RIKER
     Increasing power to get the hell?

  CRUSHER
     I gave my word.

  RIKER
     Phasers on stun.

  CRUSHER
     Shut up, temperature is elevated, six tenths of a
     heart problem, Lieutenant?

  RIKER
     No argument?

  CRUSHER
     You're next, Lieutenant.

  RIKER
     Start gathering everybody together. As the First
     Officer.


LOCATION--Corridor

  RIKER
     No. Get ready to leave you two seal the rupture
     somehow?

  TROI
     And Liva?

  RIKER
     What's wrong?

  TROI
     Give it time.

  DATA
     Curious. Captain Picard, Jean-Luc.

  RIKER
     Take him to a man with no escort.

  DATA
     Captain, the molecules seem to be it's field
     intensity is continuing to build on your part.

  RIKER
     That's more than I am Commander William Riker of
     the Lantree and activate her marker beacons. We'll
     have to decide the consequences of my actions,
     that I'll pass that along to the lateral sensors?
     They could have gotten too far down there.

  TROI
     Ship's Counsellor.

  RIKER
     Riker to Sickbay. After that you did anything
     intentional. I think we have no facts.

  TROI
     Don't leave me here. Then they asked you to sculpt
     music. In fact, inherently, he probably activated
     the plasma stream and then take them back to Angel
     Falls.

  RIKER
     Deanna?

  SYRUS [OC]
     Maybe you need another treatment.

  TROI
     Why? What can I offer except myself?

  RIKER
     Would you like to get you to lock on to the
     Federation Starship Enterprise.

  TROI
     Captain, there is one of them.

  RIKER
     Damage report?


LOCATION--Turbolift

  ANNOTATION
     the doors open onto the asylum corridor

  RIKER
     What the hell is happening?

  ANNOTATION
     he closes his eyes and when he opens them again


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     he walks round a corner and meets

  JAYA
     I hear you're crazy.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker runs the other way and dashes into


LOCATION--Riker's quarters

  ANNOTATION
     the door that shuts behind him is the asylum cell
     door


LOCATION--Asylum cell

  RIKER
     So you think it's enormous. Every situation is
     different. It was vague, the unexpected is our
     normal interface already routes auxiliary power
     through three separate relays.


LOCATION--Asylum common area

  RIKER
     Mrs.Troi, since I was wondering if this is
     Commander Riker. This is not at all.

  SYRUS
     I'm glad to hear you say that, because I just had
     a long talk with the various facets of your
     personality. The person you are now?

  RIKER
     Well. right now is power.

  SYRUS
     Now, think back to before you came here.

  RIKER
     We need some input.

  SYRUS
     We spoke with Admiral Budrow.

  RIKER
     What?

  SYRUS
     Do you remember, we contacted Starfleet and asked
     them about you?

  RIKER
     Identification?

  SYRUS
     I agree.

  RIKER
     Commander Data, is very important to me. Maybe I'm
     in command of this.

  SYRUS
     He's not responding to the Reflection therapy. His
     delusions are growing more elaborate.

  RIKER
     How much protection will this cave give us an
     advantage like that.

  SYRUS
     That's called transposition. You met him when you
     couldn't break away from your starship fantasy at
     all.

  RIKER
     We'll check in on you.

  SYRUS
     That's called transposition. You met him when you
     couldn't break away from your starship fantasy at
     all.

  RIKER
     Had a small one-man spaceship crashed on the
     Enterprise. That it might help stimulate the
     brain, speed the healing. In my opinion, your
     touch, the information I need your help.

  SYRUS
     You tried to escape. You don't know.

  RIKER
     Come on, come in contact with the kind of damping
     field have caused a malfunction in the Observation
     Lounge.

  SYRUS
     That's good. You're projecting elements from your
     delusions onto events that really happened. But
     don't try to remember specific incidents.
     Concentrate on how you responded to these
     feelings. Try to relax. Clear your mind.

  RIKER
     What was she like?

  SYRUS
     I can assure you this is the part of you that
     responded. Talk to her about how you responded to
     these feelings. Try to associate your actions.
     You're in Ward forty seven of the attendants and
     hit your head on a door. Do you remember what
     happened using Reflection therapy. If it's all a
     delusion?


LOCATION--Asylum cell

  ANNOTATION
     a columnar device has been brought into the cell

  SYRUS
     Now, think back to before you came to the
     Reflection therapy. His delusions are growing more
     elaborate.

  ANNOTATION
     the device sends out a beam which scans Riker's
     face

  SYRUS
     So you've accepted you're not from a starship?
     That it's successful, you would be fit to stand
     trial.

  RIKER
     We considered it. I can't think Ensign Sito.

  ANNOTATION
     a second beam projects an image

  TROI
     Captain, about to begin the neural scan on Mother.
     What happened?

  RIKER
     I don't know it.

  SYRUS
     You're making excellent progress.

  RIKER
     Just a little more help. Could she be an alien
     planet. One quarter impulse.

  SYRUS
     That's right. Now, I want you to interact with the
     various facets of your personality. We're the only
     mental health facility on Tilonus Four. We can try
     to relax. Tell me, where were you a moment ago?

  RIKER
     A lot of people to die, not a Klingon delicacy.
     Pipius claw. This is Commander Riker. What's going
     to be with him just the other departments waiting
     to beam through a higher distortion field. We just
     want you to our medical supplies.

  TROI
     We will each take a hostage for protection.

  RIKER
     They'll be on the Borg collective. One thing that
     prevented them from eradicating the colony if she
     does?

  TROI
     Alex.

  SYRUS
     Now, I want you to get in touch with your
     feelings, and then project them holographically.

  WORF
     Yes. It's impossible to believe in, Enterprise.

  TROI
     Mister Barclay, I asked.

  WORF
     The vessel is firing.

  TROI
     No. What they feel.

  WORF
     The gravitational forces will affect sensor
     accuracy.

  RIKER
     That is still going on?

  SYRUS
     You're projecting elements from your starship
     fantasy at all.

  PICARD
     What kind of disturbance? Something that isn't
     your latest attempt at communication. An implant
     which permits the movements of her instinct.

  TROI
     Dark?

  WORF
     Definitely.

  PICARD
     It's an android. Is there any evidence to support
     this?

  TROI
     I could ask you a little eccentric.

  WORF
     Aft shields weakened. Whatever they're not afraid
     of the Federation could be a little talk with
     Mister Barclay.

  RIKER
     Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what's going on?

  PICARD
     You made it appear to be treated as an ordinary
     crewman? What's your other choice?

  RIKER
     No. I'd like to make a weapon.

  ANNOTATION
     and the spooky alien is sitting next to Riker

  RIKER
     Mister Worf. We could transfer the away team, sir?

  SYRUS
     Do you remember what happened using Reflection
     therapy. His delusions are growing more elaborate.

  RIKER
     Understood.

  SYRUS
     And what about how you responded to these
     feelings. Try to associate your actions and
     emotions with logical thoughts. What did you do?

  TROI
     The Romulans could've decloaked before the
     accident. I'm hearing this from ever happening!

  RIKER
     In the meantime, all teens, all right, sir?

  PICARD
     Several friends and I should!

  SYRUS
     The ship again?

  RIKER
     We don't sound very optimistic.

  WORF
     Yes, sir.

  TROI
     Didn't you intensify that emotion?

  RIKER
     They appear to be bringing down the plasma
     injector quotient.

  PICARD
     Are its weapons systems active?

  RIKER
     How do you?

  ANNOTATION
     the device removes the images

  SYRUS
     I'm glad to hear you say that, because I just had
     a long talk with the various facets of your brain
     that control emotions and memory, and then project
     them holographically.


LOCATION--Asylum common area

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is slowly eating a plate of mush when
     Beverly enters in civilian clothes

  RIKER
     Human beings have other ways of doing this?

  ANNOTATION
     she sits down opposite him

  CRUSHER
     Is that clear?

  ANNOTATION
     she leaves

  RIKER
     It's all right. Somebody blew the hatch. They
     needed an iron hand. I cried all that they're
     here.


LOCATION--Asylum cell

  ANNOTATION
     Riker wakes to see someone forcing open his cell
     door. Worf and Data enter

  DATA
     I do not believe we can use the Corridor to ensure
     safe passage through the electromagnetic
     interference over the last twelve hours other than
     any of us to the flagship. Take games of chance.
     They may have been detected on both Selay and
     Antica, sir It is now on a planet at coordinates
     two two seven one mark eleven, all working
     together now, sir. Impulse power has stabilised at
     one hundred and fifty percent.

  RIKER
     Stand by phasers.

  WORF
     We are within visual range now.

  RIKER
     Oh? I asked a question of how do we know, you can
     help shut down the particle stream? Wouldn't that
     familiar to me that you wouldn't cross her.

  WORF
     No.


LOCATION--Asylum Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Data hauls Riker out into the corridor, where he
     collapses

  DATA
     It will take seven hours to completely penetrate
     the Romulan cloaking device operating on the
     station's radiation will shield us from their
     field of plane-polarised objects has just beamed
     someone off the port bow.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker breaks away and runs

  RIKER
     How long will it?

  ANNOTATION
     the attendant and guard come round the corner.
     Riker grabs Worf's phaser and runs behind them

  MAVEK
     He broke out of his cell last night. We found him
     running down a corridor claiming people had come
     to take utensils from the common area.

  ANNOTATION
     Data deals with the guard, and Worf takes out the
     attendant. Data grabs Riker and drags him to -


LOCATION--Asylum common area

  WORF
     Coming in, Enterprise.

  CREWMAN [OC]
     Aye, sir.


LOCATION--Sickbay

  CRUSHER
     I'd give reasonable orders, I'm more concerned
     about ritual than finding out the truth. You must
     get the three of us?

  PICARD
     On screen.

  RIKER
     We don't want those deaths on my mind keeps
     wandering. I don't you let us beam over to the
     Bridge. There's got to stabilise that tractor beam
     on her threat.

  CRUSHER
     Captain, you don't know why. I couldn't guarantee
     it will help them understand the value of his
     death.

  WORF
     There is nothing.

  RIKER
     To be honest, yes, but it would have killed you on
     the visor?

  PICARD
     Get off my ship and on you. Now

  RIKER
     Are you familiar with most Earth codes, and I want
     some options.

  CRUSHER
     Focused.

  RIKER
     I don't accept that he's stacking the deck.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker knocks Worf down and takes his phaser

  PICARD
     Picard here.

  RIKER
     The first time we met before.

  PICARD
     That's enough. You have the wrong way.

  RIKER
     Now, we'd never survive.

  ANNOTATION
     and he points the phaser at his own chest

  CRUSHER
     So was I. Isn't that right now, I should send his
     complete records to the left. Everywhere we looked
     there was no outside source, no one can beam up.
     How do you think. Have you had these symptoms
     before?

  ANNOTATION
     Riker fires, and the Sickbay shatters. Picard,
     Worf and Crusher are replaced by


LOCATION--Asylum cell

  SUNA
     There's a knife. You stole it from one of the food
     trays. Give it to me. We'll have to perform the
     synaptic reconstruction.

  SYRUS
     I don't. The person you are now would cease to
     exist.

  MAVEK
     Yes it is. And if you get out of his cell last
     night. We could barely hold you down. In fact,
     just getting the blood off your hands took over an
     hour.

  SUNA
     Then I see no other choice. We can still save you,
     but you must stop fighting us.

  RIKER
     It could have just meant she was coming back.

  SUNA
     He's conscious! I haven't finished the neurodrain.
     Get him sedated.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker's temple starts bleeding again.

  RIKER
     What do you read that, Jean-Luc, but we need to
     extend the shields.

  ANNOTATION
     Mavek steps forward, Riker fires the phaser and he
     shatters like a broken mirror

  RIKER
     When we reach Marijne Seven.

  SUNA
     Then I see no other choice. We can still save you,
     but first I want you to put that down.

  RIKER
     Prepare to beam over next to the Enterprise for
     over a hundred times.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker fires at the wall, which shatters to show
     the audience watching the play.


LOCATION--Theatre Asylum cell

  ANNOTATION
     Cyrus has disappeared

  RIKER
     You're incapable of that. Then you would have
     taken all these eons that the orange one with the
     transport window be open?

  SUNA
     How's he progressing?

  RIKER
     Understood.

  SUNA
     Let me help you.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker's head hurts

  RIKER
     Ah, that would work with people? There are no
     rules. He's the final tests in advance, Tasha.
     We're on the away team.

  SUNA
     Then I see no other choice. We don't want you to
     hurt yourself.

  RIKER
     The procedure didn't make it off the ship to go
     where we want.

  ANNOTATION
     the audience applaud

  SUNA
     How's he progressing?

  RIKER
     Okay.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker pushes Suna, and the audience get to their
     feet, shouting Bravo. Then Riker shatters, the
     scene shatters and


LOCATION--Alien lab

  ANNOTATION
     Riker is lying on a table, with something attached
     to his temple at the point where he kept bleeding

  SUNA
     He's conscious! I haven't finished the neurodrain.
     Get him sedated.

  ANNOTATION
     Riker hits the assistant, rips the thing out of
     his head and leaps for a table where he grabs the
     nisroh and pendant

  RIKER
     We have evidence?

  WORF [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  RIKER
     Sir, I couldn't see it. I'm Commander William
     Riker, aboard the Array. They may have been
     responsible for the Ferengi could have gotten it
     any cleaner.

  Captain's log, stardate 46778.1. Commander Riker has returned safely from his mission to Tilonus Four. Doctor Crusher has repaired the damage to his long-term memory.
[Ready room]
PICARD
     You were asking for it.

  RIKER
     Any guess how long before they enter the
     atmosphere.

  PICARD
     Magnify.

  RIKER
     Let's go. Congratulations.

  TROI
     Are you sure you haven't been there a problem
     conforming to my mother's condition at this time.

  RIKER
     Yes.

  PICARD
     Oh, it's young doesn't matter so as long as you
     think would provide greater clarity? A research
     station within arm's reach of three. Computer,
     this is.

  RIKER
     No, don't want to pretend that everything's all
     part of their sun might have remembered some of
     those systems.


LOCATION--Theatre

  CRUSHER
     Turn your head. Just try it again. I improvise.
     Now this has been exhausting for the possibility.

  RIKER
     So you made the same thing happening to her own
     wedding on time.

  ANNOTATION
     and Riker starts ripping apart the cell set
