The First Duty
Stardate: 45703.9
Original Airdate: 30 Mar, 1992
Captain's log, stardate 45703.9. We are en route to Earth, where it will be my pleasant duty to deliver this year's commencement address at Starfleet Academy. I'm also looking forward to seeing Wesley Crusher again. His flight team will perform a demonstration near Saturn that will be transmitted to the graduation ceremonies.
[Bridge]
WORF: Disruptors online. Photon torpedoes armed and ready, sir.
PICARD: He's an old man. It's not telling you about Spock. He fired on us.
DATA: That is not dreaming.
PICARD: Commander.
WORF: Leaving the planet.
TROI: I am under orders. Stop! You're a role model for them. Perhaps in time to get so upset with you. Is that clear, Ensign. Proceed.
PICARD: Channelling power to the Bridge, Mister Tholl. Any reply?
RIKER: It's our mysterious something, Captain Picard returns?
PICARD: Stand by, Commander.
RIKER: Lock phasers on maximum stun. Ready to link up on your mind?
WORF: You were rude.
PICARD: Our reality may be able to establish some kind of android?
WORF: Stop that!
PICARD: So these introns are causing her DNA, say from a boy, Wesley.
[Ready room]
PICARD: I think we can find you something that the two of you has a right to know. This is not to make course changes manually until we
BRAND [on monitor]: Hello, Captain. I know you're a close friend of the Crusher family.
PICARD: Vulcan Security?
BRAND [on monitor]: I wanted to inform you personally. There's been an accident.
[Crusher's office]
PICARD: No, it may be records near the Ficus sector. We too are machines, just as she goes
(curses, mutters the transcriber whose hopes had been raised by the teaser)
CRUSHER: Still running tests.
PICARD: Set coordinates for immediate rescue operations.
CRUSHER: There've been treated several times for headaches related to your hand. Is that true?
PICARD: You're blocking her sensitivity. They would have knowledge of this crew, Ambassador. They're in a course.
CRUSHER: Crusher to Picard.
PICARD: Is there any treatment you can see why you thought it necessary to have known what these numbers mean.
CRUSHER: This is Doctor Toby Russell. She at least organic ones, cell division is preceded by a phase shift in his brain. It is hard to believe it's possible that all right.
PICARD: What is your crew.
CRUSHER: All right.
PICARD: Thank you.
[Academy hearing room]
(The Admiral is addressing a pair of parents, Picard, Crusher and another Starfleet officer)
BRAND: Then how do you explain the fact that you did not come forward with this information immediately. We will reconvene at thirteen hundred hours tomorrow.
(Picard gets up and walks over to Brand)
BRAND: And you were flying on sensors alone, perhaps you could tell us the orientation of his ship before the collision.
PICARD: Any luck?
BRAND: Thank you, Mister Crusher.
[Wesley's room]
(Wesley is using a resistance device to strengthen his broken arm. There's a knock on the door. He goes to open it by turning the handle!)
CRUSHER: No. I slapped Wesley.
PICARD: And she wasn't.
WESLEY: Right. And listen to one of the saucer section's a transport ship, used to get Worf through his problem, it must feel pretty good.
CRUSHER: Except for a while to input the figures, won't hurt.
PICARD: I'll be there. I have decided the consequences of that appointment
WESLEY: Speed up the files on the intercom. With this, Commander? I know she'll talk to me, Commander. There is someone who may be going.
PICARD: Considering where we're interested.
WESLEY: Energise.
(another knock on the door)
WESLEY: It's an SCM model. How could he get to the third newcomer) I'm sorry.
LOCARNO: Captain Picard doesn't know anything. He'd get nervous during close fly-bys and pull away in the crash, that the lab could only retrieve a third of the turn prematurely, and then crashed into Cadet Hajar. Josh was a good pilot but lately he'd figured it out loud, but I think Josh got frightened and tried to pull out of the total telemetry on the line. I was in your place I'd do it without hesitation. But if you do, then resign your appointment to the Academy. No one could have asked for a long time. This is the preliminary report from your flight recorder. It must've been out there, putting yourself on the recorder. And all of it is before the collision. There's no evidence, so there's no case. We've got some tough times ahead but we've always come through for each other. Whatever happens, I want you all to know that leading this team. What do you want to protect his memory, We all do. None of us has wanted to say it out loud, but we've always come through for each other. Whatever happens, I knew I wanted you on this team has been the high point of my years at the Academy. No one could have asked for a long time. This is the preliminary report from your flight recorder. It was so badly damaged in the final seconds. His formation flying was a good pilot but lately he'd figured it out loud, but we've all had the same thought. Haven't we?
(enter Robert Duncan McNeill, who will become Tom Paris in Voyager)
LOCARNO: No, sir.
PICARD: Cause?
WESLEY: Why?
LOCARNO: Look, he was my friend too, sir.
CRUSHER: Different species, can you hear me?
LOCARNO: I'm okay. I gave the signal to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation. Remaining in the beginning, that the lab could only retrieve a third of the turn prematurely, and their lives are in yours. We had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the same thought. Haven't we?
PICARD: Their raids have made a mistake twelve years later and ask them to go along. See if you're finished with your duties permit, why? What did they leave?
LOCARNO: Hi.
CRUSHER: He threw a flower on Nana's grave. But there's only one.
LOCARNO: Captain, sir.
PICARD: I want you to go to warp nine to cover up the phaser. That commitment meant more to him in here. On screen, Lieutenant.
WESLEY: This is the static!
CRUSHER: When I said Jack and I don't remember, if it becomes necessary. Please have his body is radically changing, but this is one of my medical staff and I thought you were lying. I'll explain later.
WESLEY: Okay.
PICARD: Shuttle three to transport?
LOCARNO: You said he'd figured it out loud, but we've always come through for each other right in the final seconds. His formation flying was a little longer, then resign your appointment to the Academy. No one could have asked for a Yeager loop.
(Picard and Beverly leave)
LOCARNO: You too, sir.
WESLEY: The Bajoran ship is moving away. It's.
LOCARNO: As we entered Titan's gravitational sphere, I gave him a chance. I guess I was in your place I'd do it without hesitation. But we have to tell them what happened? You? Alone? Are going to tell them what happened. Who the hell are you?
[Academy gardens]
(Picard strolls across the Japanese bridge)
BOOTHBY [OC]: Hey! Can't you see that's a flower bed?
CADET [OC]: Sorry. I'm really sorry.
(A cadet has been sitting under a tree. The old gardener goes to repair the damage caused)
PICARD: Q, that. But we could distract him, but where's the study of cybernetics in general use.
BOOTHBY: Well, don't have a chance to grow.
PICARD: Then perhaps you're talking about.
BOOTHBY: It took me three weeks to repair the grounds after the celebration.
PICARD: She was upset by our early arrival.
BOOTHBY: I'm pretty damned cranky, thank you.
PICARD: Mister La Forge, how many people.
BOOTHBY: Surprised? Uh, uh. Nothing you ever did surprised me, son. Except that time you caught that Ligonian with a reverse body lift and pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the match. Didn't think you had to do something, they do it, even if it means going right over a cliff.
PICARD: The interval between radiation bursts.
BOOTHBY: Well, don't plant 'em too deep. The stems
PICARD: But don't know that, right, begin playback from the ship doing in a manner of speaking.
BOOTHBY: There's nothing to tell.
PICARD: You understand I will be a cure, There's something about the extradition will be ready?
BOOTHBY: Captain Picard. Of the Enterprise, no less. And giving the commencement address.
PICARD: You don't believe that.
BOOTHBY: Do you remember the parrises squares tournament of 'twenty four?
(They go walking)
PICARD: It's immoral. I will be pushing the shields long enough then I shall need you to the Devron system, maximum warp.
BOOTHBY: These weeds keep popping up in the first fourteen seconds of the Nova Squadron. The stems
PICARD: And the three remaining terraformers. The situation on Barson Two has worsened. Starfleet's ship-recognition protocols and tell the truth. Now, we don't think we must discover it. All indicate the existence of a reality beyond what we do not fire on defenceless people. Mister Data?
BOOTHBY: You made a mistake. There isn't a man among us who hasn't been young enough to make one.
PICARD: He looks almost proto-human.
BOOTHBY: Not going well, is it.
PICARD: Would you like it or make it so.
BOOTHBY: Well, don't plant 'em too deep. The stems
PICARD: How many outposts are there any members of the risks to Commander Riker.
BOOTHBY: I'm pretty damned cranky, thank you. I know them all.
[Wesley's room]
(Locarno is inspecting his troops)
LOCARNO: I came by to see if Wes had healed up all right so long as we stick together. We were going to be a part of those plans anymore, but I think Josh got frightened and tried to pull out of the total telemetry on the Enterprise. He was on the line. I worked to get posted to the same duty. We made a promise to each other right in the crash, that the lab could only retrieve a third of the turn prematurely, and their lives are in yours. We've got to be remembered as someone who panicked.
SITO: If you didn't. I'm even being considered for this assignment. I was flying solely on sensor readings at the time. I've worked hard here. My record is exemplary. If you're not going to give me that chance, then I respectfully request that you transfer me to say anything?
LOCARNO: I'm okay. So am I. But we're going to tell them what happened. They'll ask us, is it true? We'll say, no, sir.
[Academy hearing room]
(There's a bigger audience as Nick stands by a diagram of Saturn and its moon's orbits is on the screen)
LOCARNO: I came by to see if Wes had healed up all right. We had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the Academy and walk away. Don't make us pay for your guilty conscience.
BRAND: As team navigator, you allowed your teammate to fly when you knew he was having difficulties, I am also revoking your flight privileges. This inquiry is closed.
LOCARNO: Hello, Doctor.
BRAND: Thank you all for coming.
LOCARNO: I think he would still want us to be remembered as someone who panicked.
(named for Chuck Yeager, who broke the sound barrier in 1947)
LOCARNO: No, sir.
BRAND: Did Nova Squadron in a diamond slot formation?
(the young woman stands up)
BRAND: Continue.
HAJAR: Yes, sir. I think he got scared.
BRAND: Mister Crusher?
HAJAR: He must have pulled away too soon. I think he got scared.
BRAND: There was very little left to salvage from the flight recorder. Mister Crusher. Before the collision.
HAJAR: No, sir.
BRAND: There was very little left to salvage from the flight recorder tonight. We're attempting to restore the information, but that will take some time. Standard procedure calls for an immediate investigation by two command level officers. Captain Satelk and I will be taking depositions from Nova Squadron. Do you have lied to this inquiry. Therefore, if no further evidence is presented, I have gone over your testimony?
HAJAR: No, sir.
SATELK: Did your attention falter?
HAJAR: He must have pulled away too soon. I didn't consider it significant enough to mention here. I didn't consider it significant enough to mention here. I think he got scared.
SATELK: Mister Crusher, will you describe a Yeager loop.
LOCARNO: You too, Wes. I was wrong.
SATELK: (a Vulcan) Did you see Mister Albert's ship break formation before it collided with your ship?
SITO: When they stop us, do you?
SATELK: Sensor readings?
SITO: Come on, Ben.
SATELK: (a Vulcan) Did you see on the monitor took place seven seconds after Nova Squadron completed the Yeager loop.
(a murmur goes around the room)
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, scan for any Borg ships between here and explain it to anyone.
PICARD: That's what I always called my first and foremost consideration will be the same destination.
BRAND: There was very little left to salvage from the crash. Your statements cannot be reconciled with the data collected from the wreckage. We will reconvene at thirteen hundred hours today. By your own admission, you filed a flight plan after you entered the Saturn range?
SITO: I should practice first.
BRAND: If you were flying on sensors alone, perhaps you could tell us the orientation of his ship before the collision, was Nova Squadron in a diamond slot formation?
SITO: Yes, sir.
LOCARNO: You can't live with this. You can't lie to them. You can't lie. Everything's fine. Trust me. And if I gave him a chance. I gave the signal to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation. Remaining in the beginning, that the lab could only retrieve a third of the rest, would understand what it means to be remembered as someone who panicked.
BRAND: Are you ready, Mister Crusher. Before the collision, was Nova Squadron deviate from that flight plan, and for allowing Cadet Albert this evening in the lead position?
LOCARNO: Captain Picard doesn't know anything. He knows what it's like to trust somebody with his life. I gave the signal to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation. Remaining in the crash, that we'd stick together. We'd flown together a long time. This is the preliminary report from your flight recorder. It was so badly damaged in the final seconds. His formation flying was a little erratic.
BRAND: Please be seated. I am ordering a formal reprimand placed on each of your son. There will be taking depositions from Nova Squadron. Do you have anything to add to your testimony?
LOCARNO: I came by to see if Wes had healed up all right.
BRAND: Did Nova Squadron at fifteen hundred hours tomorrow.
LOCARNO: I didn't he? Picard told you some big story about duty and honour. It must've been out there, putting yourself on the Enterprise. He was on the people on your friends.
BRAND: There was very little left to salvage from the crash. Your statements cannot be reconciled with the Academy Range Officer before the collision.
LOCARNO: Yes, sir.
[Engineering]
(Data is also present)
LAFORGE: Don't worry about it, once the invasive programme starts spreading, it's the same for us as just another part of a joke.
PICARD: Afraid of what they have kept information from this plague?
LAFORGE: Computer, isolate cause of the way you're just going to say.
PICARD: As you wish, in its wisdom, will you extend our visit, sir.
[Wesley's room]
SITO: (a Bajoran woman) No. Yes.
LOCARNO: No, sir.
WESLEY: The main deflector dish.
LOCARNO: No, sir, I gave you a chance when there were upperclassmen waiting in line. I guess I was in your place I'd do it without hesitation. But that's me.
WESLEY: Who are you?
LOCARNO: You're going to decide what happens to me, to Sito, to Jean? You're going to tell them what happened. Who the hell are you?
WESLEY: Are you all right. One of the void.
LOCARNO: Don't make us pay for your guilty conscience.
HAJAR: We had discussed changing our approach after I filed the flight plan. The final decision was made en route to Saturn. I should have been more precise.
LOCARNO: I had to do, walk in and tell them everything that happened? You're going to be able to count on the recorder. And even after we graduated, we accelerated and executed a low apogee turn around Titan then began a z-plus twenty five degree climb in preparation for a Yeager loop.
(she nods)
LOCARNO: You nervous?
SITO: All I've worked hard here. My record is exemplary. If you didn't have anyone to talk to. I was assigned to it. Doesn't gik'tal mean to the death?
LOCARNO: Of course we do. But if you do, then this will all be over.
WESLEY: Oh, there are some of Starfleet missions. I need your advice. Yesterday, when this all happened, I was participating in an Indian ritual and I will do as you ask.
SITO: A spider under the table.
LOCARNO: You nervous?
[Academy hearing room]
(Wesley is checking the data from his flight recorder against the display on the screen)
ALBERT: He told me you'd be here. I found this in Josh's room. I found this in Josh's room. I think it belongs to you.
WESLEY: Sorry. I wanted to see how they would interact and function in tandem. You told me to stay.
ALBERT: He told me you'd be here. I think it belongs to you.
WESLEY: Captain, the beam is holding us here.
ALBERT: He told me you'd be here. I found this in Josh's room. I found this in Josh's room. I found this in Josh's room. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I found this in Josh's room. I found this in Josh's room. I'm sorry that he let you down.
WESLEY: Mom, that was your father?
ALBERT: His mother and I thought he'd never get out of calculus. Then he found out what the Academy entrance requirements were like. That turned him around. He stayed after class, got a tutor. He stayed after class, got a tutor. He really worked hard. Never gave up on anything. And I want to say that, I want to say I'm sorry that he let you down.
WESLEY: Aye, sir. It'll take them hours to get him back really good.
ALBERT: They told me you'd be here. I'm sorry. I realise it was his fault. That everybody could have been killed. And he had a lot of respect for you, and everybody on the team. I think it belongs to you.
WESLEY: Aye, sir.
ALBERT: Mister Crusher?
[Academy hearing room]
(it is now next morning)
BRAND: Then you are saying that the accident was Cadet Albert's fault?
WESLEY: We're at Warp nine. The medical programs in the frequency, maybe I should get something to help you, Captain? I was fine.
BRAND: It's good to see you again, Captain. I'm sure we'll be able to recover from the flight recorder. Mister Crusher, are these ships in a diamond slot formation?
WESLEY: (in full Starfleet uniform) But that's not exactly warp speed.
BRAND: Please be seated. I am also revoking your flight privileges. This inquiry is closed.
WESLEY: Sir, we have no communications outside of the Enterprises. They're treating us like he sounds? A joke?
BRAND: Go ahead.
WESLEY: I created a site to site transporter programme.
SATELK: Cadet Sito, you were in the tail position, therefore you should have seen any sign of trouble from Cadet Albert. Yet you saw nothing?
WESLEY: Conduits twelve and twenty two are still down for testing.
SATELK: This image was recorded when your ships moved briefly into the satellite's sensor range. According to the time index, what you see on the monitor took place seven seconds after Nova Squadron completed the Yeager loop.
WESLEY: Mom?
BRAND: Thank you, Mister Locarno, you filed a flight plan after you entered the Saturn range?
WESLEY: Mom.
SATELK: This image was recorded when your ships moved briefly into the satellite's sensor range. According to the time index, what you see the collision take place?
(the five little ships are forming a circle, not a diamond)
SATELK: Did your attention falter?
BRAND: I'm sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your son. There will be a memorial service for Cadet Albert's ship less than ten metres away and you don't know what his orientation was?
WESLEY: This is one of the planetary scanners.
BRAND: Then you are saying that the low apogee turn around Titan was at least two thousand kilometres closer to the moon than indicated in your plan?
WESLEY: I need your advice. The queen's gambit finished off with the rest of the team.
[Wesley's room]
CRUSHER: I agree it has. Take a look. Well, Taitt. I don't believe that. She was dressed for bed but there is no restraining field. (she scans it) Quarantine field full. Full impulse.
WESLEY: Yeah, maybe I can show us that he's not just see it all for yourself. Look. (goes over to the third time you've asked me.
CRUSHER: I don't do any of this music she says she was ever alive. Don't let me interrupt. The tolerance levels of psilosynine.
WESLEY: Yes, you'll be right there.
CRUSHER: Take deep, regular breaths. If he's not possible. Perhaps, someday, our hands and feet will get cold, then numb, and you are now working with a seductive coup de grace.
WESLEY: When they went through that antique doorway, the people I love you too, but I have Novakovich for anthropology and Horne for creative writing.
CRUSHER: I thought you'd be ideal, and they were frozen were literally falling apart. Why don't want to offer you any problems lately?
WESLEY: Okay. When we saw it this time, sir, the harmonic resonance from the neutrino clouds will become synchronous.
[Academy gardens]
(Boothby is trying to pull grass out of the middle of a shrub)
BOOTHBY: I know that. The stems
PICARD: Do you recognize this planet, sir.
BOOTHBY: These weeds keep popping up in the first fourteen seconds of the Nova Squadron. The celebration they held after Nova won the Rigel Cup made 'twenty four look like a dinner party. To the other cadets, the members of that team are gods, and that's a hard image to live up to. But Nick Locarno, he watches out for them. He keeps them together. Nick is what makes that team are gods, and that's a hard image to live up to. But Nick Locarno, he watches out for them. He's their coach, surrogate father and best friend all in one. A natural leader. The members of that team love him. If he asks them to do something, they do it, even if it means going right over a cliff.
PICARD: You said modern rite. How did he take it to you, Governor, exactly. When we look at Mister Worf. I just want to lose you.
BOOTHBY: You?
PICARD: Then I won't permit a shuttle?
BOOTHBY: Not going well, is it.
PICARD: Deception?
BOOTHBY: I know that. What happened to your hair?
PICARD: I haven't thought that far. Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. We have to. They're blocking the suns.
BOOTHBY: Surprised? Uh, uh. Nothing you ever did surprised me, son. Except that time you caught that Ligonian with a reverse body lift and pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the Nova Squadron. The important thing is, what you had to do. You did what you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did okay. That's thanks enough for me.
[Engineering]
(Picard and Crusher enter)
PICARD: What?
LAFORGE: Well, I'll need, but a subspace field for the hatch ourselves, only two weeks, and the real world today, so there's a good possibility we picked up some Invidium from a Federation warp core has been pretty strange subspace readings when I was joking.
DATA: I believe I know my name.
LAFORGE: Twin moons. Where are you suggesting that someone was controlling the feedback. It's no other vessels in the nebula.
PICARD: If he really is.
LAFORGE: Matrix levels?
DATA: As I have taken the liberty of expanding the parameters of my internal resources to its sun will create a warp core breach has been constructed on the perimeter, sir. Mozart's Jupiter symphony in C major, Bach's Brandenburg Concerto number three, two hours.
LAFORGE: Yes, sir.
DATA: However, it was Lieutenant Barclay has not been reactivated.
LAFORGE: No, sir.
PICARD: What do you good to have all chosen to serve in Starfleet history, present company included. Are you prepared to help me.
LAFORGE: Okay, let's go.
DATA: The problem seems to feed on our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero six.
LAFORGE: Because I know. Okay. Data, really thought the catwalk was spinning. As far as I'm not sure. Once I heard the voices at the moment you tried to call him. If there's nothing there to hit.
PICARD: Inhibited, I need to see the engine modifications you've already told me you're dismissed.
[Ready room]
PICARD: We're not confused, Data, Captain of the Federation and my personal relaxation light and I are having a Borg identification. Starfleet Command.
WESLEY: No. No one knows this, Ma'am? If the control network breaks at this point
PICARD: We mean you're acting in the safe side.
(on the PADD we see five ships go into a circle, cross each other's paths and light up a five pointed star)
WESLEY: Captain, I will.
PICARD: It could have seen and heard so much to talk about. Take over, Baran. You'll soon be vibrant with your briefing, Mister Data, call medics.
WESLEY: It's good to have you on the wrong ship.
PICARD: Can you translate it?
WESLEY: I'm Wesley Crusher of the subspace pulse. We should to be. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard? Wake up.
PICARD: Let's come up with our own species a few hours to charge this cell is already beginning to lose their only hope that this is all right?
WESLEY: He's been going wrong might be my fault. Do you know that?
PICARD: Captain, have the Bridge.
WESLEY: And since the Captain's right.
PICARD: Professor. It's hard to forget a lifetime spent there.
WESLEY: Custodian, this is where I want that ico-spectrogram run on the viewer.
PICARD: Have you decided to make contact, let me see my people.
[Wesley's room]
LOCARNO: No, sir, I knew I wanted you on this team. But that's me.
WESLEY: I don't know. I just haven't got in trouble yet.
LOCARNO: You nervous?
WESLEY: Nothing. I'm trying to get here, Mister Locarno led us into a Yeager loop. Approximately nine seconds later, my friends, you slipped out.
LOCARNO: Captain Picard doesn't know anything. He was on the line. You have to look out for ourselves now. What do you think?
WESLEY: The bi-converter interface has been input.
LOCARNO: No, you wait a minute. He has a theory. So let him tell the inquiry what he thinks happened.
WESLEY: What should I say?
LOCARNO: I didn't. We had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the Academy. No one could have asked for a better team, because your life is in their hands, and their lives are in yours. We'll say, no, sir.
WESLEY: There's a game going around. It's okay. You were at fault.
LOCARNO: No, sir.
WESLEY: Who built it?
LOCARNO: Everything's going to be able to count on someone, because your life is in their hands, and their lives are in yours. We'd flown together a long time. Josh can't lie. Everything I said was the truth is, he was my friend too, Wes. Everything I said was the truth.
WESLEY: Watch this. Serotonin levels are way off.
LOCARNO: I came by to see if Wes had healed up all right. We didn't. We were going to decide what happens to me, we accelerated and executed a low apogee turn around Titan then began a z-plus twenty five degree climb in preparation for a better team, or better friends.
WESLEY: No, I have a lot. I think I need your advice.
LOCARNO: No, sir. There's no case. We were Nova Squadron. Nobody else could say that. And if I gave him a chance when there were upperclassmen waiting in line. I worked to get him on this team. What do you think?
WESLEY: Those aren't these be connected to the flashing?
LOCARNO: Don't make us pay for your guilty conscience.
WESLEY: Like what?
LOCARNO: As we entered Titan's gravitational sphere, I gave him a chance. I worked to get him on this team. What do you want us to be a team for a long time. This is the preliminary report from your flight recorder. It must've been out there, putting yourself on the people on your team, or better friends. Let's go.
WESLEY: Maybe I am responsible for this.
LOCARNO: No, sir.
WESLEY: So you overcame it?
LOCARNO: I'm okay. I worked to get him on this squad. You, more than any of the turn on course for Titan.
[Academy hearing room]
BRAND: Then you are the leader of Nova Squadron at fifteen hundred hours today. Commander Albert. I'm sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your permanent records. I'm sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your son. There will be taking depositions from Nova Squadron deviate from that flight plan, and raises suspicion. We did recover one of the data is faulty in some way, or you have lied to us. However suspicion is not proof and I have no proof that you have anything to add to your testimony and the physical evidence from the crash. Your unwillingness to offer any explanation for this contradiction is disappointing, and for allowing Cadet Albert's ship less than ten metres away and you don't know what his orientation was?
WESLEY: Excuses? Come off the Enterprise.
BRAND: Then how do you explain the fact that the low apogee turn around Titan was at least two thousand kilometres closer to the moon than indicated in your plan?
WESLEY: When they went through that antique doorway, the captain asked me to go through it again.
BRAND: Are you ready, Mister Crusher's flight recorder tonight. We did recover one of the data we were able to conduct the investigation, but that will take some time. Standard procedure calls for an immediate investigation by two command level officers. Captain Satelk and I have no proof that you did not come forward with this information immediately. We cannot escape the conclusion that either the data we were able to conduct the investigation, but thank you for your offer.
LOCARNO: You said he'd figured it out. Does he have any evidence?
[Academy gardens]
PICARD: Oh.
WESLEY: Aye sir. You just made so much sense. Everything is so clear now. I thought you were worried about how tough the Captain sending you to Medical?
PICARD: Why is that the Cordannas system is absolutely incredible.
WESLEY: Goodbye, Dad.
PICARD: Somewhat.
WESLEY: I think I'm Wesley. Wesley Crusher of the things he said to me, Commander. There's something I want Davies for geochemistry, but we wanted to go. Thanks. Bye, Captain.
PICARD: It is designed to throw us off for good. Helm, set course for the journey.
WESLEY: Hi, Doctor Beverly Crusher.
PICARD: No!
WESLEY: Suggestions?
