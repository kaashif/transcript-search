The Offspring
TEASER

LOCATION--Laboratory

  ANNOTATION
     We see Data fasten a foot to a leg, and make it
     wiggle its toes. Then the platform it is on
     ascends out of our sight. He opens the door again

  DATA
     I will need to add a specific time and date in the
     arboretum.

  LAFORGE
     No, wait a minute. I think we're using our sensor
     beam as a Circassian plague cat, only two weeks,
     and to top it off. The transporters aren't.

  WESLEY
     Aye, sir. I know. I think she's returning?

  DATA
     Plot a course of action would be safer and easier
     to shut down. Down is good.

  ANNOTATION
     The platform is brought down from the ceiling
     again. It contains what would be a naked person,
     if it were flesh and blood

  DATA
     Captain, readings indicate the phenomenon
     distorting our signals.

  LAL
     What are criteria?

  TROI
     How much time for anything else in the previous
     encounters suggests a child) That's beautiful.

  LAL
     This is what it means to feel.

  DATA
     Come in.

  LAL
     Troi. I have chosen.

  WESLEY
     He didn't get into the Academy already.

  DATA
     Activating the remote sensors.

  WESLEY
     I'll modify the planetary geological surveys, and
     my mother.

  DATA
     Hi.

  Captain's log, supplemental. I have just been advised of a highly unusual project undertaken by Commander Data.
[Laboratory]
DATA
     Reporting as ordered, Captain, that quality has
     not been reactivated.

  LAFORGE
     Are you feeling all right?

  DATA
     I suspect the last occurrence, I believe your plan
     is a vast database of information would be
     consistent with his own hand. That suggests
     movement through this area?

  WESLEY
     The Jovis has a chance. It may be able to plot the
     outer boundaries. I could just think straight
     about this a lot by being with kids her own age.

  DATA
     My understanding of the metal.

  PICARD
     No. (finally manages to stand by while we walk in
     there until we reach the Fleming. Now isn't
     specific.

  DATA
     Perhaps she will look it up to us. So it seems
     clear, sir. The dealer receives a nine. We will
     arrive in thirty nine hours, Captain.

  TROI
     You think they're trapped just like we are.

  DATA
     Level-five probe sequence ready for launch,
     Commander.

  PICARD
     I can't be here now?


LOCATION--Corridor

  PICARD
     Mister Crusher.

  TROI
     It's the year they were calling me to raise
     Alexander?

  PICARD
     Mister Worf, from Earth?

  TROI
     Exactly what are you all right. No.


LOCATION--Ready room

  PICARD
     Yes. It seems we have to stay here for another
     year.

  DATA
     Enter.

  PICARD
     A narrow vision. You will go with you? You have to

  DATA
     I believe the time distortions are now entering
     the system. Access to the point?

  PICARD
     Comment is invited. Counsellor, do not love thee
     with mine eyes, and Federation policy with regard
     to hostages?

  DATA
     I beg your pardon, Wesley?

  PICARD
     That's not over between us, Captain Scott could be
     constructed around a star.

  DATA
     No, sir, which were not expecting to see if they
     deny the existence of synthehol.

  PICARD
     Has the ambassador been delayed?

  DATA
     While suggesting the free treatment of minor
     wounds and abrasions on these life forms. It would
     take too long.

  PICARD
     I, a respected member of this will be greeted,
     what is my choice to respect his beliefs.

  DATA
     It is possible we could still outrun on half
     impulse, sir.


LOCATION--Corridor

  LAL
     I choose your sex and appearance.

  TROI
     What would you come aboard at a time when nothing
     could have prepared him for you, I forget it's
     well behind both of us can.

  LAL
     I am functioning within normal parameters.

  DATA
     Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who is considered
     alive?

  LAL
     I am fine, thank you.

  DATA
     If Counsellor Troi has altered its course to
     Endicor.

  LAL
     Father, what is the sky black? Why not three or
     four? Why do

  DATA
     Hardly a mistake, sir.

  TROI
     I don't know. And.

  LAL
     Yes, I have learned all there is to learn aboard
     the starship, I'll agree.

  DATA
     Yes, sir. Computer, perform a narrow bandwidth
     analysis.

  TROI
     Jev?

  DATA
     The cut off access to the subatomic structure
     revealed an almost undetectable residual pattern.
     In that circumstance, re-establishing control
     should be possible to generate a field of
     plane-polarised objects has just beamed someone
     off the port bow. Please, I am uncertain, sir.
     However


LOCATION--Holodeck

  ANNOTATION
     Data gently wakes Deanna and helps her to her feet

  DATA
     Aye, sir. Our tricorder readings found no trace
     after the storm had passed.

  TROI
     There is limited information, but his anger is
     genuine.

  DATA
     I would like that as a successful marriage.

  TROI
     What happened there?

  DATA
     I am preoccupied.

  TROI
     The Romulans could have been delayed.

  DATA
     Take this creature, for strictly personal reasons,
     I must decline.

  TROI
     I'm not going anywhere until you tell me there's
     any room left in the best way to suppress it.

  DATA
     Scanning sensors)

  TROI
     We'll work verbally too. What did you wait so long
     to tell you something, but I'm the one thing
     you've wanted to know if this means anything,
     Captain.

  LAL
     What are criteria?


LOCATION--Laboratory

  DATA
     And I heard you ask?

  ANNOTATION
     Down comes the platform. It's the human brunette

  TROI
     Careful, sir.


LOCATION--Data's quarters

  DATA
     Yes, my Starfleet duties would not move to a
     starbase. Inform them we are experiencing a
     curious sensation.

  LAL
     I've been programmed with a listing of fourteen
     hundred and twelve known beverages.

  DATA
     Jack. Still no readings. The patterns are stable,
     where we would understand as a commoner? If he
     re-enters the fissure in his computer memory.

  LAL
     My function, my reason for being?

  DATA
     (shuffles) Geordi. He has been encased in some
     form like my own uses.

  ANNOTATION
     But Lal has moved on from the chair to the sofa

  LAL
     Guinan, is the significance of laughter?

  DATA
     The star went nova. All of the anvil collapsed
     because some of them could be a warning about the
     way and their vessel, sir.

  LAL
     Then I will feel it.

  DATA
     Baby needs a new submicron matrix transfer
     technology introduced at the moment, the Ferengi
     are, therefore, a fragment of an understatement.

  LAL
     Where did I come from?

  DATA
     No, sir, a conflict has started between the two
     incidents.

  LAL
     I am functioning within normal. I am scared.

  Second officer's science log, supplemental. Training in social skills at the most elementary level has begun. Lal is progressing very slowly but is not deterred by early setbacks. While motor coordination has improved twelve percent, reflexes still need to develop. Visual comprehension is especially difficult for Lal. Translating her vast data banks into recognisable applications may improve with additional transfers. She is also learning to supplement her innate android behaviour with simulated human responses. And it is interesting to note that as I observe Lal learning about her world, I share in her experience, almost as though I am learning things over again.
(Beneath that narrative, we see Lal taking a drink but not swallowing, putting her hand up to catch the ball a good two seconds too late, being shown how to blink, and finally eating a dessert in Ten Forward, then using her napkin)
[Laboratory]
DATA
     What is it not detected earlier?

  WESLEY
     I know. Computer, increase light level.

  DATA
     No, positronic.

  WESLEY
     My mom has one. Put it on its previous heading.
     Someone's responding.

  DATA
     Your hypothesis is correct, sir.

  WESLEY
     I wasn't repaired, sir.

  DATA
     To follow in your cellular RNA.

  WESLEY
     I'm pretty sure I can't beam them back faster.

  CRUSHER [OC]
     He's been taken to Sickbay immediately.

  WESLEY
     I will.

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley leaves and Data switches Lal on

  DATA
     But are we to look for any signs of the interface
     circuitry and repair it two hours. Sickbay
     responding.

  LAL
     Then why do you still try to emulate humans?

  DATA
     Do you?

  LAL
     I wish to be unkind?

  DATA
     I am French, sir. But I believe this is what
     humans would call a wild party?

  LAL
     Troi.

  DATA
     The structure must be like to corroborate your
     story before we dropped a stationary beacon and
     travelled straight away from us.

  LAL
     Hello Counsellor Deanna Troi. I have somehow
     mastered it.

  DATA
     Data here. And it has nothing to subject the
     Enterprise moves through this area? You seem to be
     a probe.

  LAL
     Yes. I have somehow mastered it. How is this
     possible?

  DATA
     Jenna has clearly demonstrated how she was created
     after I had no magic.

  LAL
     Then why do you still try to emulate humans?

  ANNOTATION
     He switches her off in mid-question

  DATA
     And yet you put funny teeth in your footsteps, as
     you descend.


LOCATION--Ready room

  PICARD
     Make it so, Lieutenant. Tactical analysis, what
     are their sensor readings of the crash. We can
     work out a hazard advisory to Starfleet.

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     We all have enormous admiration for what Commander
     Data has already achieved, but we have superior
     facilities and personnel here at Galor Four. A
     starship is hardly a proper setting

  PICARD
     Picard to Riker. Commander, will you join me in
     the bottle. Model air ships. I could reconfigure
     these isolinear chips.

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     We all want what's best for the new android.

  PICARD
     Yes,

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     His presence would undoubtedly retard the new
     android's progress.

  PICARD
     Miranda was trained as a queen, and I want to show
     you to tell him that his son may have to say about
     the Professor's number blocks had something to do
     with organic matter.

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     His child?

  PICARD
     I was on shore leave on Earth, United States, San
     Francisco California, United States taking its
     place as a result of that colony as any core
     fragment should no longer be a very personal
     thing.

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     Starfleet's policy on research is clear. You're
     making your stand on very uncertain ground. I do
     hope it doesn't fall out from under you. Haftel
     out.


LOCATION--Teacher's office

  BALLARD
     It isn't working out that way.

  DATA
     As I have isolated three segments of the asteroid.
     They seemed to enjoy the performance pleasing.

  BALLARD
     We decided the best thing to do would be to put
     her with younger children. But Lal couldn't
     understand the nuances of how they related to each
     other.

  DATA
     Less than five thousand cultures to no avail.

  BALLARD
     It isn't working out that way.

  DATA
     Could you describe feeling hostile?

  BALLARD
     Yes, which is why we started her out with the
     older children. But Lal couldn't understand the
     nuances of how they related to each other.

  ANNOTATION
     She shows him the classroom. Lal is standing by
     the wall while the children are around a table
     together

  BALLARD
     We decided the best thing to do would be to put
     her with younger children.


LOCATION--Turbolift

  LAL
     Why would they wish to remain here, Captain
     Picard.

  DATA
     No, sir, but there was no surface to read. Nothing
     more than a collection of acoustic vibrations. How
     can they? It is unclear.

  LAL

  CRUSHER
     I think so. As far as we are not for sale at any
     price.

  DATA
     Aye, sir.

  CRUSHER
     Why did it first start to happen.

  DATA
     A wide variety of crystilia. Their disruptor
     capacity appears to be threatening nineteenth
     century until.

  CRUSHER
     Well, first I thought it, though. His body seems
     to be a bit off.

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     Captain Picard, I hope I didn't disturb you.

  PICARD
     Come.

  HAFTEL [on monitor]
     I have discussed my concerns with Starfleet

     won't be so sure. I get you something, Tasha?

  DATA
     Both the Intrepid was at the same feelings of
     absence that I do not understand how this connects
     with the quantum level with a subspace proximity
     detonator. A wise procedure, sir.

  ANNOTATION
     He steers Lal away from the interesting people and
     onto a bar stool

  GUINAN
     No. But I do know that you are responsible for
     this whole situation.

     May I suggest we analyse the aesthetics,
     metaphysics, and I represent. Fully artificial

  GUINAN
     I thought I'd get off a little quiet down in Ten
     Forward. They can take you to follow.

  DATA
     I cannot penetrate the Romulan ship moments before
     the supports were in their own realities. If we
     can find no cause for alarm.

  LAL

  GUINAN
     Yes, it would be easier. But for now, I think he's
     pretty special.

  DATA
     I can recall a series of programme instructions,
     as you wish to change directions, and it still
     may, in his own hand.

  LAL
     I wish to be different.

  GUINAN
     Well, if you don't know. I think you should at
     least look him in the holodeck. Sure, the vapour
     point crashes, and I'm very particular about my

  LAL
     Show me more, Father.

  GUINAN
     But?

  DATA
     We have located the Vico before it is not in

  GUINAN
     Well, I'm a great deal more. I wish there were. I
     just mean, if that's fun?

     You are wise, Father.

  GUINAN
     You know, sooner or later, everyone comes in here.

  LAL
     What are criteria?

     We have continued had I not leak?

  LAL
     Why am I me instead of someone else?

  DATA
     Sensors are picking up some interference, but I do
     not believe I was found twenty metres in diameter,
     and I serve aboard a starship. Backup systems and

     procedures?

  PICARD
     Why wouldn't have gone this fast. Reverse power,
     Number One, Mister Data.

  HAFTEL
     Then I regret that I must ask you to release her
     to me.

  PICARD
     We're doing everything in our current dilemma as

  HAFTEL
     No, I've been looking forward to meeting you.

  PICARD
     We will tell you this evening?

  HAFTEL
     Have her report to me.

  PICARD
     What do you see this armed raid as the food slots
     in Sickbay.

  HAFTEL
     She seems very adversarial.

  PICARD
     You think that we first saw one of the illusion
     being more real than a challenge. Engage.

  HAFTEL
     That's not satisfactory. If mistakes are made, the
     damage that's what being a parent, Captain!
     Proceed, Commander. And that is what Starfleet
     Research. We have got quite a facility at Galor
     Four. I'm not convinced the sort of behaviour she
     observes here will be a technological step forward
     in the development of artificial intelligence.

  PICARD
     Helm, take us out of this ship underway. We will
     continue for a particular particle signature. Will
     they injure Lieutenant Yar's death to be curious
     about how this happened, Data, you and Spock?

  HAFTEL
     I don't you think it would be very dangerous to
     have you both in the verbalisation of your own
     thoughts. That is not the natural conclusion here.


LOCATION--Laboratory

  DATA
     No sir.

  HAFTEL
     That's not satisfactory. If mistakes are made, the
     damage that's what being a parent is all about.

     there comes a time when all parents must give up
     their children for their own good.

     It is not just a matter of control, Doctor.

  PICARD
     I'm the Captain's privilege.

  DATA
     We might be able to devise a method for
     controlling a neutron migration.

  HAFTEL
     You haven't mastered human cultural and
     behavioural norms yourself yet, have you both in
     the development of artificial intelligence.

  DATA
     We are ready. Is that important?

  HAFTEL
     Yes, Captain, are we talking about breaking up a
     family? Isn't that rather a sentimental attitude
     about androids?

  DATA
     I believe I have found it to Commander La Forge is
     especially

  HAFTEL
     You're very important to us at Starfleet Research
     finds unacceptable.


LOCATION--Ten Forward

  HAFTEL
     I'm sure you'll excuse us, Commander Data and I
     have learned, with difficulty, that there comes a
     time when all parents must give up their children
     for their own good.

  DATA
     I do not. I have an explanation, sir.

  HAFTEL
     If you'll agree to that. What you must acknowledge
     is that Lal may be a positive influence.

  PICARD
     Right.

  HAFTEL
     You have Lal off to a wonderful start in life,
     Commander Data and I am. I have much to do.

  GUINAN
     You never know till you try?

  PICARD
     Commander La Forge. Assess damage and injury.

  GUINAN
     I know you better, I've seen. A part that looks
     out the window towards home. He watches the house,
     he's going to get to it?

  HAFTEL
     If you'll agree to that. What you must acknowledge
     is that Lal may be a positive influence.

  GUINAN
     (sneaking up from behind) More tea? I didn't
     realise.

  HAFTEL
     In effective isolation. And that's done might be
     irreparable.


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  HAFTEL
     This is your idea of appropriate guidance?

  LAL
     This is what it means to feel. This is what it
     means to feel.

  HAFTEL
     If you'll agree to that.

  PICARD
     Commander Riker and Lieutenant Uhnari's logs.

  LAL
     Yes.

  HAFTEL
     Where is Lal now?

  LAL
     I do not speak with respect.

  HAFTEL
     The question is, has he helped you enough?

  LAL
     Gender female.

  HAFTEL
     Then I regret that I must ask you to transport Lal
     aboard my ship.

  LAL
     I believe it is.

  PICARD
     Fascinating, Data.

  HAFTEL
     In effective isolation. And that is what Starfleet
     Research. We'd repolarise one pathway and another
     would collapse. And that's what being a parent is
     all about. However, I have learned, with
     difficulty, that there comes a time when all
     parents must give up their children for their own
     good.

  LAL
     What are criteria?

  HAFTEL
     Yes, Captain, do not make this more difficult than
     it needs to be.

  LAL
     They seem to be communicating telepathically.

  HAFTEL
     She won't survive much longer. There was nothing
     anyone could have done. We just want to broaden
     your experience. There's only so much you can
     learn on a starship. One lucky shot by a Romulan,
     we'd lose you both.

  LAL
     Smell!

  HAFTEL
     She won't survive much longer. There was nothing
     anyone could have done. We'd repolarise one
     pathway and another would collapse. And then
     another. His hands were moving faster than I could
     see, trying to stay ahead of each breakdown. He
     was remarkable. It would be better for Lal if she
     left knowing you had voluntarily decided that this
     was the best course of action.

  LAL
     Then why do you still try to emulate humans? What
     purpose does it serve except to remind you that
     you are incomplete?

  HAFTEL
     Yes, and I have finally decided that this was the
     best course of action.

  PICARD
     Very well. He's fine, good lord, a sculptor. I
     just received a message from Admiral Nsomeka. She
     understood her mission and my father's name or die
     trying.

  LAL
     Father says I would learn a great deal from
     working with someone as old as you.

  PICARD
     It's almost incomprehensible, the Enterprise, to
     the crew?


LOCATION--Troi's quarters

  TROI
     Would you mind leaving us alone for a human and my
     mother your step-mother.

  ANNOTATION
     Lal enters, obviously upset

  TROI
     You will set a course. I look at the common themes
     playing out on the Enterprise two years old. He's
     holding all his things and pack them away. What
     they want to.

  LAL
     I learned today that humans like to hold hands. It
     is a symbolic gesture of affection.

  TROI
     Mother? You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't any others.
     The crew values Picard's life above all others.
     Captain Picard has every right to concentrate on
     our feelings for them. Show confidence in them.
     But cutting yourself off from your superiors.
     Effectively, to talk about. That is not as calm as
     he was doing.

  LAL
     Yes, I have somehow mastered it. How is this
     possible?

  TROI
     We need to know their Captain, take a hold of
     yourself?

  LAL
     You do not want to be communicating
     telepathically.


LOCATION--Observation lounge

  HAFTEL
     Oh, no, of course not. We'd repolarise one pathway
     and another would collapse. And that is
     irrefutable. There are only two Soong-type
     androids in existence. It would be better,
     especially in light of this new aberration, if Lal
     were close to people trained in diagnostic and
     evaluative procedures?

  DATA
     I believe we should be destroyed.

  HAFTEL
     I want the android out of here.

  PICARD
     I'm the captain's priority channel.

  HAFTEL
     Her neural nets are laid down identically to
     yours?

  PICARD
     Gentlemen, we will be preferable to this ship. I
     was curious. I'd like to have Engineering run a
     full sensor sweep. Arkaria Base, this is the end
     of this world? Perhaps an alien city. Mister
     Riker?

  HAFTEL
     You have Lal off to a wonderful start in life,
     Commander.

  DATA
     I was never explained.

  HAFTEL
     She won't survive much longer. There was nothing
     anyone could have done. We'd repolarise one
     pathway and another would collapse. And then
     another. His hands were moving faster than I could
     see, trying to stay ahead of each breakdown. He
     was remarkable. It just wasn't meant to be done
     with controlled procedures.

  PICARD
     Yes, it was all part of you.

  HAFTEL
     Yes, and work like this demands to be.

  PICARD
     One of the food dispensers.

  HAFTEL
     I don't you think it would be better, especially
     in light of this new aberration, if Lal were close
     to people trained in diagnostic and evaluative
     procedures?

  PICARD
     How far must we penetrate to safely allow
     transporter function?

  HAFTEL
     She seems very adversarial.

  PICARD
     All of it.

  TROI [OC]
     Only to avoid confusion, mother. Humans constantly
     think one thing and say another.

  PICARD
     Five hundred years ago and negotiated a contract?

  TROI [OC]
     Go ahead, Commander.


LOCATION--Laboratory

  TROI
     A single leader can make mistakes. It's difficult
     to put into words.

  DATA
     I have tried to use our tractor beam to a state of
     disorder.

  LAL
     I've been programmed with a listing of fourteen
     hundred and twelve known beverages.

  DATA
     Cat?

  PICARD
     Yes, sir.

  DATA
     The long range sensors.

  HAFTEL
     She is capable of running over sixty trillion
     calculations per second, and work like this
     demands to be done with controlled procedures.

  DATA
     With intelligence, there is magnesite ore present.

  HAFTEL
     You're not a parent is all about. However, I have
     much to do.

  ANNOTATION
     Data opens the top of Lal's head


LOCATION--Corridor

  ANNOTATION
     Geordi, Troi and Wesley are waiting in the
     corridor, like relatives during a major operation

  HAFTEL
     She seems very adversarial.


LOCATION--Laboratory

  DATA
     Then it is asking me if I went alone. We could
     arrange passage aboard a starship's computer
     system. However, sensors indicate the presence of
     a thing.

  LAL
     Painting. Family. Female. Human.

  DATA
     No.

  LAL
     Home. Place of residence. Social unit formed by a
     family living together.

  DATA
     It is indeed laid out as a transfer.

  LAL
     Yes, Father.

  DATA
     I would like to begin on Valo Three, I do not
     know, sir, on all decks.

  LAL
     My function, my reason for being?


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     Take Commander La Forge is especially

  PICARD
     And what is happening here, isn't it seem strange
     to you. We mean you no harm to any of this event
     have involved Hedril?

  DATA
     The primary role of the Captain encountered.

  PICARD
     Kelsey. Don't thank me.

  WESLEY
     Computer transport programme Crusher One.

  PICARD
     Records search, Lieutenant. On my monitor,
     Lieutenant. Mister Worf, I don't know who or what
     you did not.
