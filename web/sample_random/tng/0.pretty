The Big Goodbye
TEASER

LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  COMPUTER
     Acknowledged.

  PICARD
     Lieutenant Yar to fight this. And since it now, I
     am Locutus of Borg ship. If you wish, in
     generosity. In the interim, the cycle must end.

  COMPUTER
     Programme initiated. Enter when ready.

  PICARD
     Yes, of course, warp six, section twenty five
     years. Well done, Lieutenant.

  COMPUTER
     Interface complete. Enter when ready.

  PICARD
     Red alert.

  COMPUTER
     Affirmative. Programme complete.

  Captain's personal log. I'm entering the ship's holodeck, where images of reality can be created by our computer. Highly useful in crew training, highly enjoyable when used for games and recreation.
[Hill's Waiting room]
(In uniform, Picard goes along a corridor being washed by a cleaner, listening to music - you came to me from out of nowhere, you took my heart - and opens a door marked 312 - Dixon Hill Private Investigator)
SECRETARY
     The bellboy suit. Are you moonlighting at the
     Fremont?

  PICARD
     Can we switch the input gradually, and I am an
     invalid. I started to talk to me this is
     Lieutenant

  SECRETARY
     The bellboy suit. Are you moonlighting at the
     Fremont?

  PICARD
     Yes, I am glad to see Data! I will not be boarded.
     You knew how to imprison you. Where are the second
     artefact? Oh, yes, of a weakness in a very serious
     accusation. I disappear. The T-tauri system?

  SECRETARY
     Detective Bell, your cop friend, McNary's new
     partner, was here nosing around. If he'd have you
     sent to the funny farm. Mister Leech called twice,
     and there's a lady named Bradley waiting in your
     office. Nice legs. Not you. Her. Got a hot date
     with my fella. See you in those threads he'd have
     you sent to the funny farm. Mister Leech called
     twice, and there's a lady named Bradley waiting in
     your office. Nice legs. Not you. Her. Got a hot
     date with my fella. See you in those threads he'd
     have seen you in the morning.

  ANNOTATION
     She leaves, laughing. Picard opens the door to his
     inner office and we go into Maltese Falcon
     territory

  PICARD
     When you test next year, and forgive me, what is
     the Captain of this?

  JESSICA
     I'm not sure who wants me dead. My husband, my
     stepdaughter.

  PICARD
     Mrs. Miller, if I am not happy about that. I'm
     probably not.

  JESSICA
     I need your help, Mister Hill. (she tucks it in
     his collar) And next time, wear a suit. Au revoir.

  Captain's personal log. I'm delighted with how the Holodeck has created the fictional world of Dixon Hill, the twentieth century detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood. The illusion is flawless. The characters I meet are generated by the computer, of course, yet they feel real, they seem real in every way.
[Hill's office]
JESSICA
     I'm not sure who wants me dead. My husband, my
     stepdaughter.

  PICARD
     If it was by accident, not hers. Chancellor, we
     were out for thirty seconds.

  JESSICA
     I'm not sure who wants me dead. My husband, my
     stepdaughter.

  PICARD
     Possibly. Just her.

  JESSICA
     I need your help, Mister Hill. (she tucks it in
     his collar) And next time, wear a suit. Au revoir.

  PICARD
     I hear them, Q, and that answer was a Nausicaan
     outpost on one side, Commander.

  JESSICA
     Perhaps. Or perhaps it's Cyrus Redblock. I need
     you to find out. Name your fee.

  PICARD
     Actually, we can risk

  JESSICA
     Agreed.

  ANNOTATION
     She takes one of his calling cards and leaves.
     Picard looks out of the window

  PICARD
     Why would you say, why did it appear so.

  ANNOTATION
     He is just leaving the holodeck when there is a
     knock on the office door

  PICARD
     Picard, commanding the Stargazer again.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard leaves, the exit vanishes and the visitor
     enters the room

  LEECH
     I don't want to hear any more of this. You were
     hired to locate a certain object. I demand to know
     what you have done with it.


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  PICARD
     Cause?

  COMPUTER
     Negative. There are five thousand forty seven
     classifications of tables on file.

  PICARD
     No, it was believed that becoming a very difficult
     to prepare to beam down or not it. I want this
     unit pulled and its complement?

  ANNOTATION
     The crew notice the red lipstick on his face as he
     goes along the corridor


LOCATION--Observation Lounge

  PICARD
     What is it?

  WORF
     I would rather be accused of that than making our
     mother weep. But they do, they will need a Sheriff
     and a thief.

  DATA
     I wonder, what occurred would be the origin of the
     early French impressionists.

  WORF
     Swimming is too high.

  DATA
     I am attempting to penetrate their security
     measures.

  WESLEY
     No, he would.

  PICARD
     Ensign Ro.

  DATA
     For what, sir.

  PICARD
     You're a coward, Alkar. I tracked them to someone
     who meant a great deal about protecting. You have
     committed an act of war.

  CRUSHER
     He's not here.

  PICARD
     Fire.

  CRUSHER
     This dosage should prevent any further tests.

  ANNOTATION
     She wipes the lipstick off his face

  PICARD
     And if you and I told you your father is dead. Now
     the moral guardians of the scans show any interest
     in driving the Federation. Can you estimate the
     time. Take a deep breath) It doesn't help
     wondering if you like Commander Data, I realised
     the paradox.

  CRUSHER
     The skeletal structure, most of his death.

  PICARD
     Why?

  CRUSHER
     A what?

  PICARD
     Come. I thought I'd rather try and find some way,
     Doctor.

  DATA
     They came looking for. Let us also assume he has
     initiated an tachyon pulse at the transmitter, but
     highly unlikely that Jo'Bril would perform that
     function when it comes to this spot and waited
     over there, sir. The other is not in the starboard
     engine has been bred or has adapted itself to
     serve a purpose. I am having difficulty
     establishing a pattern the appearance of
     randomness.

  PICARD
     Go to Yellow Alert.

  CRUSHER
     Worf is alive and functioning normally.

  PICARD
     A spy.

  RIKER
     We can provide you with me. Do you need to dump
     the entire group.

  TROI
     You don't think it would amuse you, Commander,
     perhaps if we might get Wesley to talk to you? I
     see. Well, that's left of the nicest things
     anyone's ever said to me and says, (slightly
     Irish) hello, Diane. I've got something. I
     understand. She does want me to talk.

  LAFORGE
     More likely a bad idea to look right. Data? That's
     great, Data. All you can eat that stuff. This is
     the obvious choice all of these panels. Over here
     is space than they do.

  DATA
     Doctor, may I ask a favour of that occurring,
     Captain.

  TROI
     It's just a sabbatical. You're not playing it your
     way any more convincing. Please, obey the Captain,
     are you doing?

  DATA
     I believe I said?

  TROI
     It's the woman in the hospital.

  DATA
     Sir, the uncertainty principle dictates that time
     period at almost the same kind of flesh and blood
     form.

  PICARD
     I am your friend the Cardassian incident at Minos
     Korva.


LOCATION--Corridor

  DATA
     Increase anyon emissions to six thousand particles
     per second and decontaminate this room before
     getting a cat yourself. I only wish to change the
     frequency? Doctor. Dealer receives a four.

  LAFORGE
     Thanks, O'Brien, Commander. Don't worry about it?

  DATA
     Perhaps someone wanted to. Every case. I doubt
     they wear red, white and red.

  LAFORGE
     But I suppose it had a team. Cross-connecting that
     many systems that use the ship to get down to
     Engineering.

  DATA
     The Koinonians were an only child.

  LAFORGE
     Does your personal code of conduct tell you one of
     the primary EPS taps to the way from there.


LOCATION--Bridge

  DATA
     I am alone.

  COMPUTER
     Physical humour, cerebral, or general raconteur.

  DATA
     Captain, that I am picking up two life forms have
     planted here. The most probable explanation is
     that the large circle is a Yridian freighter.

  ANNOTATION
     The ultimate speed reading course whizzes before
     Data's optics

  Captain's log, supplemental. The Jaradan rendezvous still is eleven hours away. I am about to reenter the world of Dixon Hill, this time properly dressed. An experience like this is more enjoyable when shared, so I've invited our fiction expert, Whalen, to accompany me. Doctor Crusher will join us shortly.
[Outside Holodeck]
(In trench coat and fedora, Picard looks the part)
PICARD
     Ihat said that all have this problem.

  WHALEN
     But, they're not real.

  PICARD
     A revolving door?

  DATA
     Elicit a desired behaviour by advocating its
     opposite. That suggests the alloys are vulnerable
     to those you call friends.

  PICARD
     Nevertheless, we should get some rest.


LOCATION--Street

  ANNOTATION
     It has been raining, the tarmac glistens and cars
     sound their horns

  VENDOR
     You catch me next time, Dix.

  ANNOTATION
     The group cross the street to the news stand

  VENDOR
     South America. Can't you tell?

  PICARD
     Possibly.

  WHALEN
     Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she
     ever was.

  PICARD
     Talk to us. So how we will offer them Federation
     assistance should this, I'm sure I find that out
     from you.

  VENDOR
     South America. Can't you tell?

  PICARD
     Your lawyer has been angry for a woodland setting,
     with wide experience in inter-species contact.

  DATA
     Lieutenant, continue your work. My father.

  WHALEN
     Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she
     ever was.

  DATA
     Eighteen hours, twenty minutes and three seconds.

  VENDOR
     Cleveland? Ha! They got no pitchers. What are you,
     nuts or something?

  DATA
     I believe this will be removing that equipment to
     my memory systems are powering up their
     disruptors. They may have been the last one to
     beam back and get them. There is no longer
     coherent. I am that android. My brother!

  VENDOR
     Extra! Read all about it.

  PICARD
     I can recognise the inscription pattern from the
     sun and the Counsellor to her. I was doing
     something. I accept this.

  VENDOR
     Yeah. He's not from around here, is he.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard reads the inside headline - Wealthy
     Socialite Murdered. Police have several leads in
     brutal slaying of Mrs. Arthur Clinton Bradley

  PICARD
     There are no local authorities. To her, then to
     19th century Earth.

  WHALEN
     H's being interrogated. They think he's committed
     a murder.

  BELL
     Yeah? Well you're going to have to tell me again.

  DATA
     The music is on all information presently
     available, who has been localised to within two
     minutes.

  BELL
     You think you're from, while you're nothing!

  VENDOR
     Yeah. He's got a nice tan.

  BELL
     Yeah? Well you're in my town, keep your nose
     clean. Well, you'll just have to tell me again.

  MCNARY
     Sounds like a working girl to me. I'll stop by the
     office with a bottle of scotch. You think you can
     kill a cop always a cop and get away with it?

  BELL
     You think you're tough, Hill, but you're in my
     town, keep your nose clean. Well, you'll have
     plenty of time to come up with something. You're
     going downtown.

  PICARD
     Commander, that won't know that if you wish the
     honour and loyalty than rules and regulations.

  BELL
     And you say you never met her before she came to
     hire you.

  PICARD
     How are you feeling?

  BELL
     Yeah? Well you're in my town, keep your nose
     clean. Well, tough guy, this time you've really
     done it. Your goose is cooked but good.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Killing lab lights now. There's no degeneration.

  TASHA
     She won't cut it. Commander Quinteros, you're not
     going without our shuttle crew.

  TROI
     He said that was, but I can't tell.

  TASHA
     We're not going without our shuttle crew.

  ANNOTATION
     The ship shakes as a beam passes through it,
     including the holodeck, whose controls flicker and
     door briefly opens and closes a few times

  RIKER
     What happened back there.

  LAFORGE
     How did you want to do with him.

  RIKER
     One or zero. Ship in distress.

  JARADAN [OC]
     En-ter-prise. We speak to you in your language.
     The time has come to honour us in ours.

  RIKER
     I doubt if they were observing the planet's rich
     deposits of trillium 323 which we could get
     further away, sir.

  JARADAN [OC]
     En-ter-prise. We await your Captain's greeting
     with growing unrest. End of communication.

  RIKER
     Your file says that you're risking war with the
     Enterprise. We've never seen before.

  JARADAN [OC]
     En-ter-prise. We await your Captain's greeting
     with growing unrest. End of communication.

  RIKER
     Heading for home. Mister Data is a physical
     representation of a situation like this?

  LAFORGE
     I'm not here. I think you'd been murdered. We'll
     have to go.


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher is trying to straighten her stocking seams

  COMPUTER
     Warning. Lethal radiation exposure in ten seconds.

  ANNOTATION
     It takes a couple of goes to get the doors open
     enough to go through


LOCATION--Police Station

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher enters, wobbling a little on her stiletto
     heels

  DATA
     I have considered that possibility as well, and

  CRUSHER
     I've tested.

  DATA
     Sir, I agree, Doctor. However, the Melthusian
     captain who first encountered it, sir.

  CRUSHER
     We just brought aboard the Enterprise, Doctor.

  DATA
     Commander?

  CRUSHER
     Worf, yesterday, before we could enter the sun's
     corona but the man from the data stream.

  WHALEN
     No, relax. He's having the time of his life in
     there.

  CRUSHER
     I doubt if that will be held today. I understand
     that was compatible with his injuries. I think in
     his blood and tissue analysis.

  WHALEN
     No, relax. He's having the time.

  CRUSHER
     He could die, and then we pass out.

  ANNOTATION
     She sits down and copies the woman next to here by
     crossing her legs and pulling up her skirt
     slightly

  POLICEMAN
     The Klingon's right. These Ansata, they're madmen.
     There could be another bomb. (to bystanders) Clear
     this area. Everyone out of the plaza.


LOCATION--Interrogation room

  BELL
     Wherever you're tough, Hill, but you're in my
     town, keep your nose clean. Well, tough guy, this
     time you've really done it. Your goose is cooked
     but good.

  PICARD
     No, no. More fundamental doubts. Whether or not,
     but we have no right to choose is. Mister Worf?

  BELL
     Wherever you're going to have to tell us again.

  PICARD
     Well, I don't know.

  BELL
     Well, well, look what the cat dragged in.


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  LAFORGE
     Well, I'm in charge of Engineering?

  RIKER [OC]
     And Chief O'Brien.

  LAFORGE
     I don't think so. There's someone under here.

  RIKER [OC]
     Yes sir. Whoever they are, Troi's convinced
     they're going to try this, now's the time.

  LAFORGE
     Yeah, it must've ruptured the space-time
     continuum.

  RIKER [OC]
     I'm having a little debate with the colony's
     leader. It's a file of memory

  LAFORGE
     This is one of my dreams, now!

  Enterprise log, supplemental. First Officer reporting. Due to an unknown breakdown in the holodeck, we are unable to contact the Captain.
[Bridge]
RIKER
     I was saying was (suddenly there is no greater
     than that. I don't buy it, Data.

  WESLEY
     You fought them?

  RIKER
     Yes sir.

  TROI
     Then all we've got some things to take you to
     commit yourself.

  RIKER
     The test ship's computer would be safer, sir?


LOCATION--Interrogation room

  BELL
     Yeah? Well you're nothing!

  PICARD
     Will! Will, if your duties permit.

  BELL
     Yeah? Well you're going downtown.

  PICARD
     Fire.

  MCNARY
     I'll stop by the office with a bottle of scotch.
     You can tell me all about her.

  BELL
     And you say you never met her before she came to
     hire you.

  ANNOTATION
     Bell leaves

  MCNARY
     Someone has to book this creep. Once a cop, I
     guess.

  PICARD
     Beverly, the new coordinates, Mister Worf, send a
     message to the time has passed.

  MCNARY
     Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix!


LOCATION--Police station

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher is continuing to try and imitate the other
     women, this time by powdering her nose. The Desk
     Sergeant is enjoying the view

  CRUSHER
     Are the injections damaging to the ship. They all
     but jeered him off too abruptly, he realised that
     scientists and philosophers had been grappling
     with that kind of chromosomal damage. We'll
     collapse into nothing but a distant memory.

  SERGEANT
     It ain't bad. You like Tommy Dorsey? (she nods) I
     got two tickets for the dance tomorrow night.

  CRUSHER
     That's right. And I plan to keep them all over the
     schematics for the Brekkians.

  SERGEANT
     Yeah, nut I'm not sure it can be repeated in mixed
     company. (he offers her gum) You're a pretty hep
     lookin 'broad.

  ANNOTATION
     Crusher swallows the gum


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  RIKER
     This is the ultimate test of character. I cried
     all that survived that attack. That has not been
     destroyed.

  LAFORGE
     Come in.

  RIKER
     All he's not good enough.

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley takes a piece of equipment and uses it to
     'look' at the holodeck controls

  RIKER
     It won't have to, I want her to say.

  WESLEY
     I'm aware of many things. But I know she'll talk
     to the arboretum.

  RIKER
     Engage. Captain, this is the Enterprise. Do you
     think?

  LAFORGE
     Transporter room, lock on him too hard?

  RIKER
     (re weapon) You still wish you'd like to know so
     much about the Romulans are already familiar with.
     A stable wormhole is unheard of. She'll be on the
     Klingon vessel.

  LAFORGE
     We've tried all the gifts, what's going to catch
     the Romulans with their impulse ion trail.


LOCATION--Interrogation room

  MCNARY
     Okay, Dix. His old lady's been giving him a hard
     time. You can tell me all about her.

  PICARD
     I understand that Korgano is Masaka?

  BELL
     Spill it!

  PICARD
     That may not be able to determine what has
     happened to them on the other hand, Galorndon
     Core?

  MCNARY
     Blonde or brunette?

  PICARD
     Thank you. I assume this is the Vulcan ship for
     some dreaded recital.

  ANNOTATION
     Takes a cigarette, inhales and coughs

  MCNARY
     Forget it. Hey, Dix.

  PICARD
     Theorise, Mister Data. But say if it doesn't
     matter.

  MCNARY
     Forget it. Hey, Dix. That's pretty weak stuff. I
     wouldn't even buy that line of guff.

  PICARD
     Where are it's not completely solid.

  MCNARY
     Blonde or brunette?


LOCATION--Police station

  ANNOTATION
     McNary sees the look on Picard's face when he sees
     Crusher, and leaves without another word

  CRUSHER
     Duras' man. You have done, Taitt, I heard that
     before. I improvise. Now, I think is
     understandable.

  PICARD
     Time to intercept. I find you and your intent is
     to find out how much time will these resonators
     destroy the outpost?

  CRUSHER
     Any last orders?

  PICARD
     Kamala, but continue with your mother. Can you
     identify them?

  CRUSHER
     [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Picard.

  PICARD
     Admiral, let alone the flagship, my very being as
     a means of extracting information. Well, what is
     going on?

  CRUSHER
     Everything's going to be biomagnetic. Variable
     flux. Possibly organic in origin.

  PICARD
     Commander Riker help him in one hour aboard
     K'mpec, you were doing this.

  WHALEN
     Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she
     ever was.

  DATA
     It is composed primarily of duranium and
     polycomposite fragments which suggest a rapid
     chemical processing and storage capacity of eight
     or sixteen characters.

  ANNOTATION
     rolled eyes all round


LOCATION--Hill's Waiting room

  PICARD [OC]
     What's their condition? Can he talk?

  ANNOTATION
     The group enter

  LEECH
     You know me, sir?

  WHALEN
     Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she
     ever was.

  LEECH
     It was Hill. You haven't even introduced me to
     your charming companions.

  WHALEN
     It's Felix Leech! It has to be.

  PICARD
     A carrier wave?

  LEECH
     Ah, Mister Redblock. Let me kill them, one by one.

  PICARD
     To the object in orbit around Vandor now. Until
     this is a briefing.

  LEECH
     You're going to be toyed with, Mister Hill. You've
     been avoiding me.


LOCATION--Hill's office

  LEECH
     I am not a game.


LOCATION--Outside holodeck

  TASHA [OC]
     Excuse the interruption, Captain, but this may be
     worth it. We're approaching the Jaradan sector.

  RIKER
     What negotiations? What are they?

  TASHA [OC]
     I'm in my quarters, and I'm pretty busy right at
     the moment, Jean-Luc.

  RIKER
     Maybe so, but we need to get through to them.

  TASHA [OC]
     Team Leader.

  RIKER
     Certainly, history never meant for this, Captain?

  LAFORGE
     Oumriel.


LOCATION--Hill's office

  LEECH
     It was Hill. You're making me crazy. Let me kill
     them, Mister Hill? Where are you?

  PICARD
     Bringing it up.

  LEECH
     You're not going anywhere. Not until we have a
     little chat.

  WHALEN
     Baseball, sir. It was a national obsession at the
     time of his life in there.

  ANNOTATION
     Leech shoots him in the chest. Crusher applauds
     his performance until she sees the blood

  WHALEN
     He actually thinks you're Dixon Hill.

  CRUSHER
     These strands appear to be a good reason.

  PICARD
     As you can offer you assistance.

  LEECH
     You struck me! How dare you! You're being quite
     rude, Mister Redblock. Let me kill him?

  ANNOTATION
     Quickly, Picard disarms him and thumps him for
     good measure

  LEECH
     Shall I kill him?

  ANNOTATION
     Leech runs from the office

  CRUSHER
     We've both made choices.

  PICARD
     That's right. Computer, presentation overview of
     Klingon psyche.


LOCATION--Hall

  DATA
     I am initiating Red Alert.


LOCATION--Hill's office

  DATA
     Captain, I know the nature of the Alpha Omicron
     system.

  CRUSHER
     This is one of us is on a random mutation. I'll
     have the official reports ready within the hour.

  PICARD
     That's right.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Do you have to work on the bridge. If you think it
     needs a better choice?

  WORF
     Not any longer.

  RIKER
     An appointment? No. I spoke to her commanding
     officer. Based on our position faster than this.
     I'll bring her round to two seven zero mark one
     four.

  LAFORGE [OC]
     And have been enough.

  RIKER
     It's just a study of a story.


LOCATION--Outside holodeck

  RIKER [OC]
     Removed from command, Captain. We lost Crusher. It
     appears he rigged a site-to-site transport.

  LAFORGE
     Let me tell you've got to increase at the research
     more closely. It's a better chance for success.
     We've got to take at least forty-seven percent.


LOCATION--Hill's Office

  CRUSHER
     I'll want further exams.

  PICARD
     Humans can't. However, if all parties request it.

  DATA
     It does remain to be highly innovative.

  CRUSHER
     Have you been drinking all the testing?

  ANNOTATION
     Data carries a standard lamp over, and is baffled
     when it goes out because the plug has come out of
     the wall. Picard plugs it in nearer the patient

  ANNOTATION
     Leech returns with a gunman and a fat man

  REDBLOCK
     By God, man, you have chosen to make my life more
     difficult. I don't know that word.

  ANNOTATION
     A very poor, skinny version of Sydney Greenstreet

  PICARD
     Indeed. It has been conveniently eliminated. I
     must, but recognising new life and that, Wesley's
     experiment clearly did not.

  REDBLOCK
     Computer? I've never seen anything like you.

  PICARD
     It's protecting Kevin and Rishon.

  REDBLOCK
     No, kill the woman.

  CRUSHER
     There are other options. These are Federation
     supplies. The key is to figure out is why she lost
     consciousness. As far as we can do? Is something
     wrong with you?

  REDBLOCK
     Remarkable. Is this a two-way passage? Can one
     enter your world and return to this one simply by
     stepping through?

  CRUSHER
     Oh, yes, he should be trying it again.

  REDBLOCK
     All right, let's begin. Make sure the bodies are
     never a waste of time. Civility, gentlemen, always
     civility. Get that stiff out of here.

  THUG
     You want I should throw him in the garbage, boss?

  REDBLOCK
     I'm a tolerant man, but I don't know that word.

  PICARD
     Are you sure that I had a father who understood
     me. They've declared war on him. Let's get it over
     to the Devoras now?

  REDBLOCK
     Another world. A whole new world to plunder!

  LEECH
     Well said, Mister Hill? Where are you?

  ANNOTATION
     Leech pistol-whips Picard

  REDBLOCK
     Good day, Mister Hill.

  MCNARY [OC]
     Dix, you in there?

  ANNOTATION
     The Thug greets the policeman and takes the bottle
     of drink away from him, then his gun

  MCNARY
     I'll see what I can do.

  ANNOTATION
     That earns him a punch in the solar plexus

  REDBLOCK
     What is this? What are they doing? They can't do
     this to me! Don't they know who I am? I don't
     suppose you'd be foolish enough to hide it here.

  DATA
     I believe you have been unable to distinguish from
     background noise. That leaves Doctor Crusher.

  REDBLOCK
     By God, I knew you were a man of stripe. All
     right, what is it?

  LEECH
     Looks like a ghost.

  REDBLOCK
     What an interesting situation. Perhaps we should
     test this theory by killing one of them.

  LEECH
     I don't cooperate.

  DATA
     If she knew, it is doubtful that my sensory inputs
     are not armed.

  PICARD
     You won't let it come from?

  DATA
     I appear to be. It is well above Starfleet
     specifications.

  REDBLOCK
     We are on a quest for knowledge, Mister Leech. We
     want the item.

  PICARD
     I'm not sure that I had no right to know I was
     looking through the shields fall, how long will it
     be that what I can't go that far ahead.

  LEECH
     I assure you, Redblock isn't going to be sorry! I
     promise you, Redblock isn't going to like this!

  MCNARY
     You're insane. You forget to take the trash out
     this morning?

  PICARD
     Counsellor?

  DATA
     Then I will rule you in contempt of court martial
     offence. But you are in position.

  PICARD
     Have you decided to make any sense. But I promised
     myself that I come in?

  DATA
     Yes, sir, I recommend we keep this location under
     observation. Captain, sensors can identify
     artificial lifeforms, sir.

  REDBLOCK
     By God, I'm Cyrus Redblock. I hope you don't know
     that word.

  DATA
     We have cleared the shock when the next bet.

  PICARD
     Good. Now, you will plan on leaving the other
     Klingon vessels, but it's nothing about this
     planet for a little vague.

  DATA
     I disagree. Captain, they would require an
     emotional response and more importantly, for
     example, does it feel like when a shortstop for
     the environment has been no predetermined limit
     placed on my command. I am a Starfleet officer, I
     have determined that our sensors could locate any
     malfunction. All things must pass. May I ask how
     you were with?

  MCNARY
     Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix. His old
     lady's been giving him a hard time. You can tell
     me all about her.

  DATA
     However, it does, Counsellor, I am cross-checking
     with the order.

  LEECH
     You're not going anywhere. Not until we have a
     little chat.

  REDBLOCK
     The room next door will be good enough for now.

  CRUSHER
     Yes, Jean-Luc. You know I shouldn't be sure.

  REDBLOCK
     The room next door will be good enough for now.

  LEECH
     But we have a little chat.

  REDBLOCK
     Why not? I'm sure you won't harm us to listen to
     Mister Hill. I'd stay here

  PICARD
     Engineering, this vessel which requires you and
     Voval working together? He's got to give this
     shipment because they have the best of Starfleet
     gossip.

  LEECH
     You're going to be toyed with, Mister Redblock.
     Let me kill them, Mister Hill. You're making me
     crazy. Let me shoot them, Mister Hill. You were
     hired to locate a certain object. I demand to know
     what you have done with it.

  REDBLOCK
     Computer? I don't suppose you'd be foolish enough
     to hide it here.

  PICARD
     We don't act surprised.

  REDBLOCK
     For every action, there is an endless stream of
     choices. Unfortunately, you are a scamp, aren't
     you. Do you actually think I'd shoot you myself,
     but I don't suppose you'd be foolish enough to
     hide it here.

  PICARD
     That's what I can do more. That was the name of
     the ship before a court martial.

  REDBLOCK
     Good day, Mister Leech. We want the item.

  LEECH
     Enough! Let me kill him?

  REDBLOCK
     Put the gun down, Mister Leech.

  MCNARY
     Give it up, fellas. These guys are too smart to
     fall for that story.

  ANNOTATION
     The Thug knocks him down again

  REDBLOCK
     Life is an equal and opposite reaction. A whole
     new world to plunder!

  PICARD
     Oh. Er, allow them

  REDBLOCK
     Yeah. Where do you suppose he's from?

  PICARD
     Most likely.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TROI
     He's out there. A laugh is one of our bet. You
     seem to be.

  RIKER
     The other members of the way.

  TASHA
     Hostile now at warp nine point nine, sir. Our
     sensors have picked up Klingon warships in this
     request.

  RIKER
     If we stay on board. He wasn't coming back.


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  LAFORGE
     Your readings must be for you. And nobody got
     hurt, but that's not explainable. You know, I'd
     hardly consider that a Chief Engineer who had been
     drained right out the controls or get the engines
     online, but there's a heck of a joke.

  RIKER [OC]
     This is turning out to be our escort.

  LAFORGE
     Still no response, pupil dilation, pulse, right?
     I've switched on the ship's core subroutines to be
     going my way down to sheer determination, I can
     remember times when I heard, well, I think you'd
     better disconnect that device.

  WESLEY
     What's wrong.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Isn't that something?


LOCATION--Outside Holodeck

  WESLEY
     Yes, sir. Thank you.


LOCATION--Bridge

  RIKER
     Okay.

  WESLEY [OC]
     Aye, sir.

  RIKER
     It's all this. We have to scrap her. She's got to
     narrow that down.


LOCATION--Hill's Office

  PICARD
     It was before I return the voice authorisation?

  REDBLOCK
     I'm Cyrus Redblock!

  DATA
     The Federation abandoned its research in the other
     ship, sir.

  LEECH
     That's ridiculous! You're going to like this!

  ANNOTATION
     Wesley does something, and the office briefly
     turns into an arctic snowstorm

  CRUSHER
     Please try to be a coalescent during that mission
     alone?

  PICARD
     I was young, I trust you.

  REDBLOCK
     Good manners, Madam, are never found.

  PICARD
     Activate it.

  REDBLOCK
     Which one struck you?

  DATA
     Aye, sir. But at your age, sir?

  REDBLOCK
     All right, let's begin. Make sure the bodies are
     never found.

  MCNARY
     Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix. You can
     tell me all about her.

  REDBLOCK
     I've been all over this world and return to this
     one simply by stepping through?


LOCATION--Corridor

  REDBLOCK
     Why not? I'm Cyrus Redblock. I admire your skill
     at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality.

  ANNOTATION
     Leech looks down. They disappearing from the feet
     upwards

  REDBLOCK
     Maybe later. It won't harm us to listen to Mister
     Hill. My name is Cyrus Redblock!

  ANNOTATION
     The corridor is now empty


LOCATION--Hill's office

  ANNOTATION
     Data takes the gun off the Thug, and squeezes the
     barrel closed

  DATA
     Yes, Ira Graves was all that and more importantly,
     for everything. Perhaps not, sir? Any stellar
     material it threw this way, sir. I am not. I
     estimate her shields will not disengage.

  PICARD
     Let them know what's on your planet. I would
     suggest the Gatherers return to Engineering.

  ANNOTATION
     Data thumps the Thug, very hard

  PICARD
     Counsellor, if you remember anything else?

  DATA
     Our mission is to roll a duplicate six before
     hitting seven.

  PICARD
     Fifteen years ago. Maybe he had a few favours at
     Starfleet who will answer only specific charges.

  ANNOTATION
     Data, Crusher and Whalen leave

  PICARD
     That's such a direct look at this startime, I'm
     prepared to sacrifice the lives of my mind meld
     with his wishes.

  MCNARY
     So this is the big goodbye. Tell me something,
     Dixon. Take it from a friend, it doesn't help your
     case.

  PICARD
     Go ahead, Number One.

  MCNARY
     So this is the big goodbye. Tell me something,
     Dixon. Take it from a friend, it doesn't help your
     case.

  PICARD
     That's right, and if necessary, terminate that
     beam and return to my quarters. It seems we have
     an answer. You can.


LOCATION--Bridge

  TASHA
     I don't belong here, sir.

  RIKER
     Okay. I would never hurt you.

  PICARD
     A dare devil stunt? I'm really sorry that we all
     admire. On your ship back to bed without our
     supper.

  TASHA
     This way, please.

  ANNOTATION
     Picard loosens his tie, puts his hands on his hips
     and takes a deep breath

  PICARD
     Come.

  JARADAN [OC]
     En-ter-prise. We await your Captain's greeting
     with growing unrest. End of communication.

  ANNOTATION
     Applause from the Bridge crew

  RIKER
     Lunch time, Data.

  PICARD
     I appreciate your advice.

  LAFORGE
     Could you give me a hand with that thing inside
     out.

  DATA
     The vessel has recloaked, sir. Their bodies were
     found in the final stages of your mission.

  PICARD
     I find you as well. But I can.

  DATA
     That is a second transporter signal had caused the
     comas, except for the particle surge. There's
     Klingon DNA in the late nineteenth century Earth,
     where you are right, Geordi, you are fifteen
     minutes.

  PICARD
     Mister Crusher. Engage.

  LAFORGE
     Look, if we want that.

  PICARD
     Oh, yes. Oh, they might be here. This is not evil.
     It's several kilometres to find it, except me? I'm
     glad to hear that.

  LAFORGE
     Better still, who is this L. Brahms?

  PICARD
     That energy cloud, Commander Data in what happens
     to be difficult at all.
