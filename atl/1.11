   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [Sheppard is yelling for Kolya not to kill Weir.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Kolya! Kolya don't do this!

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Kolya points his gun at Weir.]

     WEIR
     How is this going to help you get what you want?

     KOLYA
     Sheppard put you in this position, not me.

   [McKay steps in front of Weir.]

     MCKAY

     (pleading)
     You can't do this. This is crazy. You need her.

     SORA
     She's right, Commander.

     MCKAY

     I'm not kidding. There are codes required to activate the shield,
     codes that only she knows. You can't do it without her.
     (realizing Kolya might kill him instead)
     Well, you can't do this without me either. I mean, we're a package
     deal. I mean, you take us out of the equation, and you don't have an
     end game. Granted, that's a chess term. My point is, we're the only
     ones who can fix the grounding station.
     (voice increasing until he's shouting)
     We're the only ones who can activate the shield. We're the only ones
     that can solve problems I can't even think of yet. You kill either
     one of us, and you don't get what you want! That's how important we
     are. It's impor--

     WEIR
     Rodney. Rodney, he gets it.

   [Kolya lowers his gun and walks away. McKay grabs his arm as if
   remembering the pain and that it is bleeding.]

     WEIR

     (to Sora)
     I appreciate--

     SORA
     You're an asset we need to complete this mission.

   [She storms off.]

     WEIR
     You stepped in front of a gun for me.

     MCKAY
     Don't thank me just yet. We've got two and a half hours till the
     storm hits, and unless our luck changes drastically, this city is
     going to be obliterated.

   [Kolya rests against a console and picks up a Genii radio.]

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Major Sheppard, how's this for credibility? Weir is dead.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I am going to kill you.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Maybe. Stay out of my way, or McKay will join her.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [Sheppard huffs in frustration and lowers the Genii wrist radio. Off
   the balcony, the storm approaches and it grows dark. Sheppard runs back
   into Atlantis.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The city is being beaten by waves and rain.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [In the rear part of the gate control room, Ladon uses an Atlantis
   laptop and the large display to find Sheppard in the city. He is
   several levels below the control room.]

     LADON

     This is amazing. There you are.
     (to soldier)
     We're here. Take two men, head there. Four levels down. That's
     Sheppard.

     GENII SOLDIER

     (to other soldiers)
     Yes, sir. Let's go. You're with me.

     LADON

     (to Sora)
     He's heading out of the hallways.

   INT--ATLANTIS NEAR STAIRWAY

   [Sheppard descends the stairway, his machine gun drawn and ready to
   fire.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS MAINLAND, DAY

   [The puddle jumper is still being deluged with rain and lightening.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The jumper is shaking. A huge tree falls to the ground just in front
   of them.]

     FORD
     Holy--

     BECKETT
     All right. That's it!

   [He starts to manipulate the Jumper controls.]

     FORD
     What are you doing, man?

     BECKETT
     Adding weight to the Puddle jumper by resetting its inertial
     dampeners.

     FORD
     You shouldn't screw with those controls. We're heavy enough.

     BECKETT
     Can't be too careful.

     FORD
     Yes, you can. You can be way too careful. There's no chance we're
     going to blow away here. Let it go.

     BECKETT
     That should be enough.

     TEYLA
     How much longer until the storm passes?

     BECKETT
     I guess we're barely halfway through, but there's no way to tell.

   [Teyla gives him a worried look.]

     FORD
     I know. I hope they're okay, too.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard makes his way into a room with a circular platform, then goes
   down some steps, using his life-signs detector to guide him. After a
   moment, he runs off.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The sun breaks through, and the rain stops.]

     BECKETT
     What's this then?

     FORD
     We're through it?

     BECKETT
     We can't be. It's not possible.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard examines the LSD and uses it to guide his movements. He stops
   at a corner and looks at his watch, then at the LSD again, then keeps
   going.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     LADON
     He's moving.

   [The large display shows Sheppard moving one direction and three
   others, Genii, moving the opposite direction in the corridor next to
   Sheppard's.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard takes a position where he can overhear the soldiers talking
   on the walkway level just below him.]

     GENII SOLDIER
     Are you sure we're on the right level?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     GENII SOLDIER

     (over radio)
     Where did he go?

     LADON
     Shh. He can probably hear your stupid questions.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard activates and sets down some smoke canisters.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Ladon and Sora look in frustration as Sheppard's life-sign moves away
   from the soldiers'.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [McKay leads Weir and Kolya to the grounding station Sheppard was at
   last. It's raining hard there, and they all get soaking wet
   immediately. McKay examines the station.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, will you look at this? Now, that is just... That is just never
     going to be useful again.

   [He pulls a cover off, revealing fiber optic cables.]

     MCKAY
     I should be able to bypass this switching station entirely.

     KOLYA
     Good. How long?

     MCKAY
     It's not half as bad as it looks. I'd say fifteen, twenty minutes
     tops.

     KOLYA
     Do it.

     MCKAY
     Dr. Weir, I need you to--

     WEIR
     Right, of course.

   [She kneels beside him and shines the flashlight.]

     MCKAY
     Keep that there.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard makes his way back to a room. He looks at his watch and the
   LSD again, then sets out another smoke canister and leaves. Smoke
   starts to fill the room.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS MAINLAND, DAY

   [Ford, Teyla, and Beckett walk down the back ramp of the Jumper. The
   weather is calm, the sun shining. There are large clouds around them.]

     FORD
     We're in the eye.

     BECKETT
     Right. Has to be.

     TEYLA
     The eye?

     BECKETT
     Dead center of the storm. The storm swirls around a twenty- to
     forty-kilometer-wide area.

     TEYLA
     Then this calm will not last?

     BECKETT
     No, in fact, in about ten minutes, it's going to get very ugly
     again.

     FORD
     Well, come on. We have to help the Major.

     BECKETT
     Aye, we can take off but landing's twice as hard, believe me. What
     if the storm's reached Atlantis?

     FORD
     Has it?

     BECKETT
     Not just yet, but it will anytime now.

     FORD
     Stop wasting time. Let's go. Let's hit it. Let's go.

   [Ford pushes Beckett into the Jumper.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Beckett sits in the pilot seat.]

     BECKETT
     We still have to fly straight through the storm, Lieutenant. It's
     insanity.

     FORD
     This is not insanity. This is a spaceship. We can fly up and over.

     BECKETT

     (incredulous)
     Straight up and down?

     FORD
     Straight up and down.

     BECKETT
     I'm a bloody medical doctor, not a magician!

     FORD
     You can do it.

     BECKETT
     Teyla?

     TEYLA
     If we can help, we must.

     BECKETT
     Oh! Oh, crap.

   [He turns to the controls.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     LADON

     (watching the display of life-signs)
     Twenty feet away.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [The Genii soldiers make their way to the room Sheppard was last in,
   but the air is smoky.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The display shows the soldiers to be nearly beside Sheppard.]

     LADON
     Five feet.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

     GENII SOLDIER
     There's so much smoke. Which way?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     LADON
     You're right on top of him.

     GENII SOLDIER
     Yeah? I think I would see him if I was.

     LADON
     Stand by.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard is poised on the catwalk above the soldiers. He uses his
   laser site to aim at them.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Ladon and Sora hear gunfire.]

     LADON
     Do you see him? Did you get him? Report.

   [The life-signs blink out on the display until there is only one
   remaining. Laden lowers his head in sorrow.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     SORA

     (over radio)
     Commander.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Yes, Sora.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA
     Ladon has been leading three of our men on a reconnaissance mission.
     It seems Major Sheppard has killed three more of our strike team.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION

     KOLYA
     Tell everyone to move back to the control room.

     SORA
     Right away, sir.

   [Kolya turns away, leaving McKay and Weir able to talk.]

     WEIR
     Why did you tell him you could have this fixed in fifteen to twenty
     minutes?

     MCKAY
     Oh, I don't know. Maybe so he wouldn't kill us.

     WEIR
     I understand that, but once the shield is operational, we won't be
     very useful, now, will we?

     MCKAY
     Why did you let me tell him I could fix it in fifteen or twenty?

     WEIR
     You just have to stall him some more.

     MCKAY
     Well, I just told him how long it'll take.

     WEIR
     Find another problem with it. Tell them that the power loop
     interface isn't jiving with your walkabout, something.

     MCKAY
     "Isn't jiving"?

     WEIR
     Rodney, you get my point. Though from the sounds of it, if we can
     buy Sheppard enough time, it seems like he can take care of the rest
     of them on his own.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Radio Chief Cowen. Tell him to send reinforcements. A full company.
     (to Weir)
     If you're hoping Major Sheppard can diminish our numbers, you are
     mistaken.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard comes to a halt.]

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. What would McKay do?

   [He gets and idea and runs off.]

   INT--ABOVE ATLANTIS

   [The Puddle Jumper is making a steep descent to the city.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Beckett is struggling to fly the craft.]

     FORD
     Uh, you're coming in a little steep, Doc.

     BECKETT
     Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm very aware of that.

     FORD
     I told you not to play with the inertial dampeners.

     BECKETT
     I'm pretty sure I got them back where they were. Why don't you try
     to contact the major?

     FORD
     First, you got to get us in there.

     BECKETT

     (fighting the controls)
     Come on.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Near tubes filled with colored liquid and a stack of metal trunks,
   Sheppard sees a hand-painted sign that says "Really Really Dangerous --
   Don't Touch -- McKay". He grimaces. He is standing next to a naquadah
   generator.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Ladon and Sora see that Sheppard is near a power source.]

     LADON

     (rhetorically)
     What are you up to?

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard lifts the control on the generator, de-activating it.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The power goes out. Ladon and Sora turn on flashlights.]

     SORA
     What's he done now?

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard moves away.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     LADON
     I should have seen this coming.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Commander. Major Sheppard has cut power to the control room.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     How?

   [The conversation switches between the control room and the grounding
   station.]

     LADON

     (into radio, investigating the various control consoles as he
     speaks)
     It looks like Atlantis is being powered by five small generators,
     each responsible for a separate area of the city. Major Sheppard has
     just disabled the one generator that powers Stargate operations in
     this tower. Now, we still have most primary operations. We have
     definitely lost all secondary systems.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Can you still track Sheppard?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     No.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     And we have no idea where he is now?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     No, sir.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard enters a transporter station. He is able to overhear the
   Genii conversation.]

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Is the control room secure?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Yes, Commander. I suggest we send some men to guard the remaining
     generators.

   [Sheppard exits the transporter on a higher level. He takes a deep
   breath and moves out, using his LSD, his machine gun ready.]

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     No! He's trying to divide us into manageable numbers. Just hold
     Stargate operations until the reinforcements arrive.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Understood.

   [Sheppard keeps advancing.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     MCKAY

     (to Weir)
     If he asks what's taking so long, you have to do all the talking,
     okay?

     WEIR
     You'll be fine.

     MCKAY
     No, no, I won't. I'm a terrible bluffer. I've lost small fortunes at
     poker. My eye twitches. I laugh inappropriately. It's not pretty.

     KOLYA
     What's our progress?

     WEIR
     We've hit a small snag. We're just running a diagnosis to make sure
     we can interface our codes properly.

     MCKAY
     It's a small snag, small snag. It's, like, half an hour at the most.

   [The power around their area goes out.]

     LADON

     (over radio)
     Commander Sheppard has just disabled another generator.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Yes, Ladon I'm aware of that. He's cut the power to grounding
     station three.
     (to McKay)
     Can it still be repaired?

     MCKAY

     (looking at dead connectors)
     Without power? No.

     KOLYA
     Can the plan be completed without it? The other three grounding
     stations have been disabled.

     MCKAY
     No. No, it's just not good enough. Look, by uncoupling the grounding
     stations, it means that when lightning strikes the city, the
     electricity will have nowhere to go. Now, if we can channel the
     electricity properly through the conduits that line the city
     corridors, we should be able to power the shield...temporarily. If
     any of these grounding stations are left active, a sizable amount of
     electricity will find its way to ground and no shield.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The storm is deluging the city, and causing near darkness.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA

     (starting to panic, into radio)
     Commander, the storm has not slowed its pace. We have little time to
     get the shields activated. We should re-evaluate our goal. Perhaps--

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     We still have more than enough time to complete our objectives.

   [The conversation switches between the control room and the grounding
   station.]

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Then I must strongly advise that we send men down to repair the
     deactivated generators and to guard the remaining active ones.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Agreed, teams of two but I want you to watch over the control room.
     As soon as the reinforcements arrive have them take Sheppard with
     overwhelming force.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Understood.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     MCKAY
     Perhaps we can be under shelter while we wait. I'm liable to catch a
     cold like that...

   [Kolya just stares at him.]

     MCKAY
     I take it that's a "no"?

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER BAY

   [The jumper has landed. Ford and Teyla check the surroundings, and Ford
   gets a second machine gun. One of the Athosians rushes out, but Teyla
   bars his way.]

     TEYLA
     Remain here and be still. I will return for you.

     BECKETT
     Where are we going?

     FORD
     Armory.

     BECKETT
     Are you sure that's what we should be--

     FORD
     You know you're always saying you're not military, you don't have to
     take orders?

     BECKETT
     Aye.

     FORD

     (handing Beckett the gun)
     Now you do.

     BECKETT
     So long as it's temporary.

   [The move out then pause.]

     BECKETT
     Should we try and contact the Major now?

     TEYLA
     The Genii may be monitoring our frequencies. We do not want to alert
     them of our presence.

     FORD
     Life-signs detector.

   [He hands one to Beckett.]

     BECKETT
     These wee dots don't tell us much about who's who. How do we know
     which one's the Major?

     FORD
     He'll be the dot getting rid of the other dots.

     BECKETT
     Great.

   INT--ENTRANCE TO GENERATOR ROOM

   [Two Genii guard the entrance to a room with a naquadah generator.
   Elsewhere, two more soldiers do the same.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA
     How many should we expect?

     LADON
     A full company, sixty or more. I don't know how we were expected to
     take a facility this size with any less.

     SORA
     It was supposed to be a raid to retrieve what was rightfully ours.

   [The Stargate activates.]

     SORAS

     (to solider)
     With me. Come on.

   [They run down the stairs.]

     LADON

     (into radio)
     Reinforcements are arriving now, Commander.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Have them secure Stargate operations and report back to me.

   [Soldiers are coming through the Stargate.]

     LADON

     (into radio)
     Yes, Commander.

   [Ladon turns around, right into a punch from Sheppard. Sheppard lowers
   him to the floor quietly then goes to a console and does something to
   the 'gate.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

     SORA

     (to arriving soldiers)
     Secure the area. Then I want you to--

   [The Stargate starts to flicker strangely as the shield has been
   raised.]

     SORA
     Shut it off. Ladon!

     GENII BASE GUARD
     Oh, my god!

   [She looks up to see Sheppard in the control room.]

     SORA
     Stop him!

     GENII BASE GUARD
     Up there!

   [Sheppard runs out, shooting down at the soldiers as he goes.]

     SORA

     (into radio)
     This is Sora. Stop sending the reinforcements! The Stargate shield
     has been raised.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [McKay, Weir, and Kolya overhear.]

     SORA

     (over radio)
     Sheppard has raised the gate shield.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Shut it down. Turn it off.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA

     (into radio)
     I don't know how. Ladon is unconscious.

   [She works frantically to open the shield, while the sounds of bodies
   hitting it are heard over and over.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     KOLYA
     Tell her the procedure.

     MCKAY
     I can't. I don't know what he's done!

     KOLYA
     Tell her.

     MCKAY
     Well, he must have entered his own personal command code.

   [Kolya grabs McKay at the railing of the balcony.]

     KOLYA
     What is it?

     MCKAY
     I don't know!

     WEIR
     Only Sheppard would know it.

     MCKAY
     Trust me, I'm not that brave. I would help you if I could.

     KOLYA
     You have command codes.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA

     (sadly, into radio)
     It's no use. It's over. The gate has shut down. There are no more
     men coming.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     How many men made it?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Five. Five of sixty.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [Kolya grabs McKay as if he is going to kill him. Weir grabs Kolya but
   he barely notices.]

     MCKAY

     (shouting)
     You still need me if you want this city! You still need both of us!

   [Kolya backs off. Weir helps McKay up. He puts his face in his hands,
   and Weir appears to be freezing.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS CITY, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     LADON

     (somberly)
     He's entered some sort of security code to lock down the gate. Just
     give me some time. I should be able to crack it.

     SORA

     Do it.
     (into radio)
     Commander? Ladon thinks he can have the gate fixed.

   [The conversation switches between the control room and the grounding
   station.]

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Did Athor's son make it through the gate?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     I'm sorry?

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     His name is Idos. Did he make it?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     No, sir.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Over sixty men killed.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Defending his home and his people, Commander, as we would.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     When can more reinforcements be sent?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     It will take time, perhaps an hour.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Unacceptable!

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Yes, Commander, it is unacceptable, because by then, we will be in
     the full force of the Storm.

   [McKay and Weir sit on the steps, fully in the rain.]

     MCKAY
     Probably sooner.

   INT--NEAR NAQUADAH GENERATOR ROOM

   [Sheppard stalks the room, preparing to attack the men guarding it. His
   ear-piece radio activates.]

     KOLYA

     (over radio)
     Major Sheppard, I have a proposition for you.

   [Sheppard moves away from the guards.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Ford and the others have overheard Kolya's transmission.]

     FORD
     Do you recognize that voice?

     TEYLA
     No.

   INT--ATLANTIS STAIRCASE

   [Sheppard descends quickly while speaking.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Kolya I'm having a hard time keeping up. What's the score again?

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     My men have informed me that not only have you disabled some crucial
     generators, but you've stolen key components which make it
     impossible for them to be restored.

   [The conversation switches between Sheppard's location and the
   grounding station.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Yeah, I did that.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     There are two flaws in your plan.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I'm always open to constructive criticism.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     One, the assumption I would believe you'd rather destroy the city
     than let it fall to us is childish.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Doesn't sound like me.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Second, if and when I determine Atlantis unsalvageable, Doctors Weir
     and McKay become obsolete.

   [Sheppard stops short.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Weir is alive?

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Dr. McKay was able to make a strong case for keeping her alive.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Let me talk to her.

   [Kolya brings the radio to Weir.]

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Sheppard. We're both here.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     It's good to hear your voice.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Yeah, it's good to hear.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     We have less than one hour before the storm hits full-force. If the
     power is not returned to grounding station three within the next ten
     minutes, Dr. Weir dies.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Again, you mean.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Her death will buy you another ten minutes, after which should the
     power still be out, Dr. McKay dies. We will then leave with what we
     can, and the city will be destroyed.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Well, that's not enough time.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     If you don't mind destroying Atlantis, stay where you are for the
     next twenty minutes...starting now.

   [Sheppard takes off running down the stairs.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ARMORY

   [The three arrive.]

     FORD
     Don't load up so much. It'll slow you down. Two extra magazines
     each.

   [He hands Beckett and Teyla magazines of ammo then grabs a Wraith
   stunner for himself.]

     FORD
     All right.

     BECKETT
     What do you need that for?

     FORD
     Anything I see moving is going to get shot.

     BECKETT
     So what if it's the Major?

     FORD
     Then he'll get hit with a Wraith stunner instead of a P-90.

     BECKETT
     What if he sees us first?

     FORD
     He'll probably hear you first.

     BECKETT
     Are you telling me to shut up again?

     FORD
     Again.

     BECKETT
     Right.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     FORD
     Let's go.

   [The find a wall map.]

     TEYLA
     Which naquadah generator would power the third grounding station?

     BECKETT
     You're asking me?

     FORD
     Whichever one it is, it's going to be an ambush. We've got to be
     there.

     BECKETT
     There's one here.

     FORD
     Is that a guess?

     BECKETT
     Aye, but it makes sense.

     FORD

     It's the closest. All right, I'll take point. Teyla, you're on our
     six. (Beckett)
     You, don't open your mouth until I say so. Only shoot at what I tell
     you to shoot at.

     BECKETT
     You don't have to be so bloody pushy.

     FORD
     That's an order.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Guards are searching for Sheppard. He avoids them.]

   INT--NAQUADAH GENERATOR ROOM

   [Sheppard arrives back at the generator that powers the third grounding
   station. He starts to plug it back in, pulling out the key component
   from his backpack. Guards come in behind him.]

     GENERATOR ROOM GUARD
     Stop!

     SHEPPARD
     Look, your boss wanted me to turn this thing back on, so I think we
     should do what he says.

     GENERATOR ROOM GUARD

     Be quiet. (into radio)
     Sora. We have him.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Keep him alive. I'm on my way.

   INT--NAQUADAH GENERATOR ROOM

   [The three arrive to find the generator working normally.]

     BECKETT
     Is it the wrong one?

     FORD
     Yeah, I'd say so.

     BECKETT
     Oh, don't you blame me for this. I'm not an engineer. I really only
     have a basic understanding of how Rodney and his team configured the
     power, so don't expect me to--

     FORD
     You just can't stop talking, can you? You just can't help yourself.
     No matter what I say--

     BECKETT
     Aye, and you're such a nice young lad until you're put in charge,
     you cheeky little bugger.

     TEYLA
     Wait... What if this is the right station and the Major has not made
     it back yet?

     BECKETT
     Oh, she's right.

     FORD
     No. No, this one's working.

     TEYLA
     How much time?

     FORD
     Two minutes. There's five generators. It's not this one. It can't be
     the one that powers the control tower. That leaves three. We've got
     a one in three chance of guessing the right one.

     BECKETT
     Even so we may just be walking into the very ambush we're trying to
     save him from.

     TEYLA
     We're not far from a transporter. Are any of the generators near a
     transport station?

     BECKETT
     Aye. There's two.

     FORD
     Well, let's go.

   [They rush to a transport station.]

     BECKETT
     Okay, if I remember correctly--

   INT--TRANSPORT STATION

   [Beckett studies the map/control panel.]

     FORD
     Remember correctly.

     BECKETT
     I think they are here and here.

     FORD
     Which one are you sure is next to a power generator?

     BECKETT
     Okay, just give me a moment.

     FORD
     No moments. Pick one.

     BECKETT
     I'm the one you're going to blame if it's wrong.

     FORD
     We have to go now.

     BECKETT
     Here.

   [He pushes a destination and closes his eyes, breathing hard.]

   INT--NAQUADAH GENERATOR ROOM

   [Sheppard is on his knees, his back to the soldiers.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't mean to be a bad prisoner or anything, but Kolya is going to
     kill one of my people if I don't get this thing turned back on in
     time, so--

     GENERATOR ROOM GUARD
     Turn around.

   [He stands up and turns to face them.]

     SHEPPARD
     You turn around.

     GENERATOR ROOM GUARD
     What?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, if I have to turn around, you should turn around.

   [The two soldiers are stunned from behind by Ford.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell took you so long?

     FORD
     Well, there's this storm--

     SHEPPARD
     Just hold that thought.

   [Sheppard re-activates the generator.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [The lights come back on.]

     KOLYA
     It seems Major Sheppard wants you to live. Let's get back to work.

   [McKay and Weir get up and return to the station, miserably wet.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sora approaches the generator room and overhears the Lanteans
   speaking.]

     FORD
     You okay, sir?

     SHEPPARD
     I've been better. Been worse. My shoulder's a little sore.

     BECKETT
     Do you want me to take a look at that?

     SHEPPARD
     I'll take a rain check there, Doc.

     TEYLA
     We should leave this area. More Genii will be on their way.

     BECKETT
     I couldn't agree more.

   [Sora listens as the leave, not having seen her. She follows them.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     MCKAY
     If this doesn't work...

     WEIR
     It will.

     MCKAY
     I'm just saying, if it doesn't work...

     WEIR
     It will.

     MCKAY
     I'm sure it will, but in the unlikely event that it doesn't--

     WEIR
     Rodney...Please.

   [McKay activates the controls. Out over the water, the grounding
   station disconnects from the ground pole.]

     KOLYA
     Fantastic.

     MCKAY
     Oh, thank God.

   [Weir smiles.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

     SHEPPARD
     McKay figures he can harness the storm's lightning to fire up the
     shield.

     BECKETT
     This lightning?

     FORD
     SG teams have done it before to power a Stargate.

     BECKETT
     There's a big difference between a Stargate--

     FORD
     I didn't say you could talk.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     MCKAY
     Now...I need to run the subroutine that will convince the input
     buffers in the shield generator to attenuate the raw electricity
     into usable power. I can only do that from the control room. That's
     where Dr. Weir's codes come in.

     WEIR
     Yes.

     KOLYA
     Only primary systems are operating. Sheppard has to repair the other
     generator.

     MCKAY
     The shield's considered a primary system. We're good to go, but we
     have to go now. I mean now. I mean everybody, all your men.

     KOLYA
     What does that have to do with my men?

     MCKAY
     Now that the grounding station's been deactivated electricity will
     be free to flow through the conduits that line every corridor in the
     city.

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

     BECKETT
     What kind of a plan is that?

     SHEPPARD
     A Rodney McKay kind of plan. It's all we've got.

     FORD
     And it leaves us only one place to go.

     TEYLA
     Where the Genii will also be.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

     MCKAY

     Now, the control room and Stargate operations are shielded, but the
     rest of the city... (he shakes his head)
     Once the lightning starts to hit...

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

     SHEPPARD
     Anybody left in the hallway is as good as dead.

   EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY

   [Kolya considers what to do as Weir stands shivering.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS CITY, DAY

   [Some lightening starts to strike the city.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Weir and McKay work at a station, Weir entering her command codes.]

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Why haven't you responded?

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sora follows Sheppard and the others.]

     SORA

     (into radio)
     She's here, Commander.

   [The scene switches between the control room and Sora's position.]

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Who?

     SORA

     (into radio)
     Teyla. She and two others have joined Sheppard.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Why wasn't this reported sooner? Fall back to the control room
     immediately.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     She's just out of my reach. If I am patient--

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     I gave you an order.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     She left my father for dead.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     The storm is upon us. The city is no longer safe.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     I don't care.

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Fall back. You have my word. Your father will be avenged.

     SORA

     (into radio)
     By me!

     KOLYA

     (into radio)
     Sor--

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sheppard and the others move quickly.]

     TEYLA
     Will the young hunters in the Jumper be safe?

     SHEPPARD
     The Jumper bay's part of Stargate operations. They'll be protected.

     FORD
     Then maybe that's where we should be headed.

     SHEPPARD
     If the shield goes up over the city, Weir and McKay are expendable
     to Kolya. We got to take the control room first.

     TEYLA
     Would he really kill them just because they are of no further use to
     him?

     SHEPPARD
     No, he'd kill them to punish me. Now, here's the deal. Ford and I
     get into position, just below the control room stairs. Teyla and
     Beckett head to the Jumper bay.

     TEYLA
     I intend to fight alongside you.

     SHEPPARD
     And I intend you to fight with us. Once you get in position, lower
     the ship into the gate room, open the weapons pods. That should
     create enough distraction for Ford and me to go in. We take back the
     control room, get the shield up. City's saved. Weir and McKay saved.
     Take the rest of the day off.

     FORD
     Sounds like a plan, sir.

     SHEPPARD
     Stay on channel two. Let's move out.

   [Beckett and Teyla head toward the Jumper Bay.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to Ford, referring to Wraith stunner)
     You're not going to need that thing. Shoot to kill.

   [Ford sets the stunner aside.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     LADON
     The winds are getting stronger and the wave heights are growing.

     WEIR

     (to McKay only)
     We need to keep stalling.

     MCKAY
     What for?

     WEIR
     Major Sheppard is still out there. If you activate--

     KOLYA
     Now, McKay.

     MCKAY
     It's done. Dr. Weir, I need you to enter your codes now.

     WEIR
     Yes, of course. Seven, nine... Four, two, one.

     MCKAY
     Yes?

     WEIR
     Zero, three, two, four, five.

     MCKAY
     And the second sequence?

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

     BECKETT
     I'll be glad when this following-orders business is over--

   [Sora steps out and hits Beckett with her gun, knocking him
   unconscious.]

     SORA

     (mad with anger)
     Drop it! (pointing gun at Beckett)
     I'll kill him.

   [Teyla takes off her gun and lowers it to the ground. Sora puts down
   her weapon and prepares for hand-to-hand fighting.]

     SORA
     I would hate to kill you so quickly.

     TEYLA
     I have known you for almost all your life. Why are you doing this?

     SORA
     You left him to die...

     TEYLA
     Your father killed an innocent. He alerted the Wraith to our
     presence.

     SORA
     And you escaped.

     TEYLA
     If I am to die by your hand, Sora...I die knowing there was nothing
     I could have done to have saved Tyrus.

     We're in position.

     FORD
     This isn't right.

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     FORD
     Teyla and Beckett should have easily made it to the Jumper Bay
     first. They should have been waiting for us.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Teyla, what's your position? Teyla?

   INT--ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS

   [Sora holds up a knife.]

     SORA

     (yelling)
     This was my father's. It was handed down from his father.

     TEYLA
     If you want to fight this way, Sora, I will win. You will have
     avenged no one.

     SORA
     We'll see.

     KOLYA
     Engage the shield.

   EXT--ATLANTIS CITY, DAY

   [The storm is growing in intensity.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     MCKAY
     We're starting to get hits on the Northern Pier. Routing power to
     the corridor...now. Now... Now.

   [He tries to activate the plan, but the computer doesn't respond.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, this is a problem.

     KOLYA
     What?

     MCKAY
     Look, I told you this was a long shot from the beginning.

     LADON
     We already have serious flooding on the North and West Piers.

     MCKAY
     It's no use. The city conduits just can't handle this kind of raw
     power.

     WEIR
     Is any power getting to the shield generator?

     MCKAY
     Nominal amounts. Nowhere near enough.

     KOLYA
     You said this would work.

     MCKAY
     I don't know if you noticed or not, but I am an extremely arrogant
     man who tends to think all of his plans will work!

   [Kolya hits McKay in the face.]

     KOLYA
     Idiot!

     WEIR

     (yelling at Kolya's back)
     Hey, this was a long shot at best. Why else would we evacuate the
     city? It was always our intention to dial out in case this didn't
     work. Within minutes, Atlantis will fail. You can leave and survive,
     or you can go down with the city. You choose.

   [Kolya turns back to Weir.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS CITY, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     MCKAY
     We're just not getting enough power to the shield generators.

     WEIR
     Are you really going to sacrifice the lives of all of your men on
     the off-chance that this city won't be completely destroyed?

     KOLYA

     (to his men)
     Open the Stargate. Start evacuating the remaining men.

     WEIR
     You're making the right decision.

     KOLYA
     You're coming with us.

     WEIR
     What?

     KOLYA
     You'll both serve the Genii as payment for what you've done.

   [Soldiers grab McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, for what we've done?

     SHEPPARD
     You got McKay.

   [McKay is being herded down the stairs and to the Stargate.]

     MCKAY
     Seriously, this is a bad idea. You saw what happened to my last
     plan. This is not what--

   [Sheppard and Ford start firing, shooting the soldiers. McKay gets away
   from the Genii. Ladon goes through the 'gate. Kolya grabs Weir.]

     SHEPPARD
     You're not going anywhere.... I will shoot you if you don't let her
     go.

     KOLYA
     And risk hurting Dr. Weir?

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not aiming at her.

   [Sheppard fires a single shot and hits Kolya in the chest, sending him
   backward through the 'gate. Weir falls to the floor, then gets up.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to Ford)
     Find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure that's all of them.

   [He rushes up to Weir.]

     SHEPPARD
     Sorry about that. I had to... You okay?

     WEIR
     No.

     SHEPPARD
     You will be. Come on.

   [He grabs her hand and drags her up the stairs toward the control
   room.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay goes to his console.]

     FORD
     Wait! What are you doing?

     MCKAY
     I thought I'd activate the shield and save the day. You got
     something else in mind?

     FORD
     Teyla and Beckett are still out there.

     MCKAY
     Tracking system's down. There's a tsunami headed towards the city,
     Lieutenant. In two and a half minutes, they're dead.

     SHEPPARD
     Then give them two minutes.

   purpose. She attacks with no weapon and turns Sora's knife against her,
   pinning Sora to the wall.]

     This is not what your father would have wanted. Our people were
     destined to be allies--

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Teyla and Beckett, fall back to the control room.

     TEYLA
     This must end now!

     SORA
     Then end it.

   [Teyla takes Sora's knife and throws it to the floor, then runs out,
   leaving Sora standing alone. After a moment, she follows, leaving her
   knife behind.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     MCKAY

     MCKAY
     Going!

   EXT--CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY

   [Lightening starts hitting the city strongly.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDORS

   [The lightening travels down corridors all over the city, doing some
   damage.]

   EXT--CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY

   [A huge wall of water approaches the city.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR
     What's happening?

     MACKAY
     It's working. It just needs to build up enough power for the shield
     to activate. Wait for it.

     MCKAY

     (in greeting)
     Carson.

     BECKETT
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Just in time to see how this ends, huh?

   EXT--CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The wall of water nearly reaches the city. It is much higher than the
   highest towers.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     MCKAY

     (pushing a button)
     Now.

   EXT--CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The shield rises just as the wave reaches the city. It dissipates the
   force of the water.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR
     Nice work, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Did you ever doubt me?

     WEIR
     Yes, several times.

     MCKAY
     Oh.

     SHEPPARD
     I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.

   EXT--CITY OF ATLANTIS, EVENING

   [The skies are clearing as the sun sets (or rises).]

   EXT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [The 'gate is active. Athosians and Atlantis personnel come through
   with their supplies. Sheppard and Weir watch from the control room
   balcony.]

     SHEPPARD
     What do you want to do with her?

     WEIR
     I don't know yet. We'll keep her locked up for the time being. Maybe
     releasing her back to the Genii would help ease tension between us.

     SHEPPARD
     You're extremely optimistic. You know that?

     WEIR
     You think so?

   [McKay arrives. He has a bandage around his forearm, on the outside of
   his jacket.]

     MCKAY
     Everyone getting back okay?

     SHEPPARD
     Looks like it.

     WEIR
     How fares our city?

     MCKAY
     Well, we've begun pumping out the lower levels of the East Pier,
     which was flooded. There is structural damage, nothing too serious.
     Beckett's suffered from a minor concussion. Hasn't been able to look
     at this. I had to do this myself.

   [Sheppard rolls his eyes at McKay's injury.]

     MCKAY
     Still, on the bright side I've had my first decent meal in
     twenty-four hours, so all things considered, I would say we are just
     fine.

     SHEPPARD
     They say these things happen every twenty years, right?

     WEIR
     That's what they tell us.

     SHEPPARD
     How far in advance can we book days off?

   [McKay smiles weakly, and they all walk back into the control room.]

   FADE OUT
