   TEASER

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Sheppard's team walks through the forest. Ronon looks disturbed by the
   surroundings.]

     SHEPPARD
     Something wrong?

     RONON
     I have a bad feeling.

     MCKAY
     Eh, I always feel like that. Like something horrible's about to
     happen.

     TEYLA
     How do you live?

     MCKAY
     I got used to it. Thing is, when someone else also has that feeling,
     mine gets worse.

     SHEPPARD
     Do you recognize this place?

     RONON
     I don't remember.

     TEYLA
     You must have visited many planets when you were running from the
     Wraith.

     RONON
     I didn't count.

   [Sheppard looks around the forest.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know how you tell them apart.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [The team enters a small snow-dusted village made up of two rows of
   animal hide tents with a dirt street in between. The villagers are
   going about their daily business.]

     SHEPPARD
     See, there you go. Nothing to worry about. Seems like a perfectly
     nice village to me, just like dozens of others we've visited.

     TEYLA
     It appears to be the type of encampment my people trade with all the
     time. I see no evidence of threatening behavior or danger.

     MCKAY
     I also see nothing we might be interested in trading for.

   [One man carrying firewood spots the team and stops. Sheppard smiles
   and waves in a friendly manner.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hi. How ya doin?

     ATON
     Wraith bringer!

   [Terrified, he drops his firewood and runs. The villagers instantly
   scatter in a panic, repeating his cries of "Wraith bringer!"]

     ATON
     Wraith bringer!

     SHEPPARD
     (nonplussed)
     That can't be good.

     TEYLA

     (shouting to villagers)
     You don't have to be afraid.
     (to team)
     Where are they going?

     RONON
     We need to get out of here, now.

   [A villager comes out of a tent carrying a crossbow. McKay turns around
   to face Ronon.]

     MCKAY
     I take it he was talking to you?

   [The crossbow wielder fires, hitting McKay in the buttocks.]

     MCKAY
     (in a high pitched scream)
     Aaah! That did not just happened!

     SHEPPARD
     Warning fire only!

   [As the villager reaches for another bolt, Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon
   start shooting over the villagers heads.]

     SHEPPARD
     Move!

   [Sheppard helps McKay limp away as Ronon and Teyla provide cover fire
   and back away.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [The team escape through the forest, Ronon and Teyla still providing
   cover from the rear. McKay leans heavily on Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     (screaming)
     Oh my god! It hurts! I can't feel my leg!

     SHEPPARD
     Is it pain or numbness?

     MCKAY
     Both!

   [Teyla shoots another a volley of fire, then dodges more arrows.]

     MCKAY
     What the hell did you do to these people?!

     RONON
     Don't listen to him.

     MCKAY
     How can you not recognize the 'gate address?!

     SHEPPARD
     Do you know the symbols of every address of every planet we've been
     to?

     MCKAY
     Yes, as a matter of fact!

   [Another crossbow bolt strikes the tree near Sheppard's head. He turns
   around. The villagers are getting closer. Teyla and Ronon take cover
   behind trees and try to hold them off with weapons fire.]

     TEYLA
     Go! Get to the 'gate!

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, DAY

   [Grunting from the effort, Sheppard and the injured McKay make their
   way to the DHD.]

     SHEPPARD
     Go on. We'll be right behind you!

   [He leaves McKay to dial while he heads back to help the others.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Ronon and Teyla continue the firefight. Teyla gets struck by a dart.
   Ronon sees her collapse unconscious just as she pulls it out. An
   instant later, he too is struck. He pulls it out and tries to aim, but
   is dizzy. He too collapses, unconscious.]

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, DAY

   [McKay finishes dialing the DHD. The Stargate activates. Another
   crossbow bolt just misses McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Oh! Damn it!

   [He blindly fires his P-90 behind him as cover as he limps to the
   Stargate. He's able to escape before the village teen can fire again.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Sheppard runs back to where he left Teyla and Ronon. He stops short
   upon noticing Teyla lying prone on the forest floor. An instant later,
   he is struck by a dart in his arm.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh crap.

   [He sinks to his knees before keeling over, unconscious.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [McKay arrives and collapses onto his front the floor of the Gate Room,
   the arrow still protruding. Weir hurries down the steps. Guards stand
   ready with their weapons.]

     WEIR
     Rodney! Medical team to the Gate Room!

     TECHNICIAN
     Yes, ma'am!

   [Weir reaches McKay.]

     WEIR
     Rodney? Hey. Where are the others?

     MCKAY
     They're right behind me.

   [The wormhole shuts down. Still on his stomach, McKay only hears it.
   His face falls as the medics arrive.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Sheppard awakens to find himself, Ronon, and Teyla imprisoned in a
   primitive cell made of branches. It is clearly cold in the village.]

     SHEPPARD
     (brightly)
     Well, I guess it could be worse.

   [Teyla smiles wanly but Ronon remains motionless, facing away from the
   others.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I know you must be thinking this is your fault...

   [Ronon still doesn't acknowledge Sheppard.]

     TEYLA
     I have already tried to console him.

   [Sheppard stands and comes closer.]

     SHEPPARD
     We were bound to run across a planet you'd been to sooner or later.

     RONON
     It was night last time.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   [An injured Ronon collapses in the center of the village. A young woman
   approaches. Her father limps towards her.]

     KETURAH
     Linor! Stay away!

     LINOR
     It's a man, father. He's near death.

   END FLASHBACK

   [Keturah walks through the town, looking towards the makeshift prison.]

     KETURAH
     You think we would not remember you? We offered you food and
     shelter.

   FLASHBACK

   INT--TENT

   [Linor nurses Ronon, providing him some broth. As she moves away, Ronon
   grabs her arm. Keturah starts, concerned for his daughter's safety.]

     RONON
     Thank you.

   END FLASHBACK

     KETURAH
     Maybe you did not remember our village. We were forced to rebuild
     after the Wraith came.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   [Explosions wreck the village, Wraith guards storm through, firing
   indiscriminately at the population. One soldier feeds on Linor who
   screams in agony. Keturah tries to get to her.]

     KETURAH
     Linor! No!

   END FLASHBACK

     KETURAH
     That were not merely culling us as they have in the past...they were
     looking for you!

     RONON
     I'm sorry.

     KETURAH
     Sorry! I doubt that. You will not bring death and destruction on us
     again.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I can't say the Wraith won't be back here again, but I can
     promise you they're not coming back here because of him.

     KETURAH
     No! Not once we've sacrificed the Wraith-bringer to his masters.

     SHEPPARD
     He prefers Ronon. He probably also prefers not to be sacrificed to
     the Wraith.

     TEYLA
     He is a victim of the Wraith, like all of us. His planet was
     destroyed. He was captured and made a runner, but he is not one
     anymore. They cannot track him as they once did.

     KETURAH
     They did not feed on us all last time. They promised that if he ever
     came back and we captured him, we would be forever free from culling
     in the future.

     TEYLA
     (incredulous)
     They "promised"?! They are Wraith! I promise you that killing Ronon
     will not change what happened. And it will not protect you in the
     future.

     KETURAH
     I said nothing of killing.

     SHEPPARD
     Isn't that what "sacrifice" means?

     KETURAH
     I know not what his masters will do him once we turn him over.

     SHEPPARD
     (incredulous)
     You're giving him to the Wraith?!

   [Keturah holds up a small circular disk with a green blinking light--a
   Wraith beacon.]

     KETURAH
     They left this behind so that we could call them.

     TEYLA
     (horrified)
     He has already activated it.

     SHEPPARD
     They're going to kill all of us! You included!

   [Keturah leaves them. Ronon just stares, trying to keep his guilt and
   emotions in check.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [A semi-conscious McKay lies prone on a table, the arrow still
   imbedded. Beckett works on him. Weir and a major stand nearby.]

     MCKAY
     (drunkenly)
     So many colors! All the pretty horses.

     WEIR
     What's he talking about?

     BECKETT
     I gave him some morphine for the pain.

   [An SG major bends down to look McKay in the eye.]

     MAJOR
     (enunciating clearly, and impatiently)
     I need to know how many villagers. How far is the 'gate from the
     village?

   [McKay looks at the major.]

     MCKAY
     Have you seen a guy around? He looks like you, but he's got messy
     hair. I think I...lost him somewhere...and...and a-and a pretty girl
     and a caveman.

     BECKETT
     I may have given him a wee bit too much, but he was making it
     impossible for me to treat him.

   [McKay gets distracted by the oxygen cannulus in his nose and starts
   playing with it.]

     MAJOR
     (annoyed)
     Snap out of it McKay! It's important! Come on, what kind of weapons
     do they have?

     BECKETT
     I'd say something that shoots arrows is a good guess.

   [The major graces Beckett with a sarcastic smile.]

     MCKAY
     Excuse me, why am I lying here?

     BECKETT
     You have an arrow, Rodney, in your gluteus maximus.

   [McKay lies back down.]

     MCKAY

     Oh. Well, that sounds painful.
     (he sighs)
     Gluteus maxi...mus. Glute--...maaa-xim...Oh my god! That's my ass,
     isn't it?

     BECKETT
     (resigned)
     Aye.

     WEIR
     Call me if he makes any sense.

   [Weir leaves.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Ronon calls to the villager guarding them.]

     RONON
     Get him back here...the leader of your village.

     ATON
     Why?

     RONON
     'Cause I need to talk to him.

     ATON
     It's too late for you. The Wraith will be here soon.

   [Aton draws close to Ronon as he speaks. Ronon reaches out and grabs
   him, knocking his head into one of the branches serving as bars and
   pulling him close, turning him to face the outside. He pulls a knife
   and holds it to Aton's throat while holding him by the hair. The other
   guards raise their weapons, including the dart gun.]

     RONON
     Shoot me with one of those darts, and I promise he'll be dead before
     I go down.

     MALIK
     Let him go.

     SHEPPARD
     (worriedly)
     Hey, buddy, you want to fill me in on this plan?

     MALIK
     Let him go, now!

     ATON
     (petrified)
     Get Keturah!

   [Keturah has already realized the commotion and is headed their way.]

     KETURAH
     I'm here. Unhand him now! I will not free you. These men will kill
     your friends first.

     SHEPPARD
     (nervously)
     I don't think that'll be necessary. Uh, why don't we all put our
     weapons down and talk about this nicely?

     RONON
     Let them go. It's me the Wraith want. They had nothing to do with
     what happened here.

     TEYLA
     Ronon!

     SHEPPARD
     (low, to Ronon)
     Don't.

     RONON
     They won't shoot me. They must know the Wraith still want me alive.

     SHEPPARD
     I was a bit more worried about them shooting us.

     ATON
     Please, Keturah.

     KETURAH
     Let him go, now!

   [Ronon pushes Aton away, then holds the knife to his own jugular.
   Sheppard and Teyla stare at Ronon in alarm, horrified.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you doing?

     RONON
     Back off, Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD
     Drop the knife, now!

     RONON
     No!

   [Ronon looks over to Keturah. Aton stands beside him, still rubbing his
   neck.]

     RONON
     I didn't mean to bring the Wraith here, but it was my fault!

     TEYLA
     That isn't true!

     RONON
     You know it is. I should never have come here. I should never have
     stayed. I'm sorry about what happened to your village, but if you
     think turning me over to the Wraith will keep you safe, fine, do it!
     I'll do whatever I have to to make up for what happened, but don't
     punish them for my mistake. They're good people. You let them go, or
     I'll be dead before the Wraith get here. I promise. Then see what
     the Wraith do to you.

   [Sheppard and Teyla exchange worried looks. Ronon has sounded more and
   more desperate as he speaks, obviously not bluffing.]

     SHEPPARD
     We're not leaving. Not without you.

     RONON
     (ignoring Sheppard)
     You let them go.

     ATON
     (nervously)
     We have no issue with the other two.

   [Keturah studies Ronon, who is pressing the knife hard into his own
   throat.]

     KETURAH
     Let them go.

   [The door opens and guards drag Sheppard and Teyla out.]

     KETURAH
     Resist, and you will be killed.

   [Once Sheppard and Teyla are dragged towards the Stargate, Ronon drops
   his knife hand. As Sheppard and Teyla are led away, Ronon is shot by a
   dart. Sheppard looks back, haunted.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Chuck sees the Stargate being activated.]

     CHUCK
     Incoming wormhole!

   [The chevrons light and the Stargate kawhooshes. Weir arrives. In the
   Gate Room, the SFs and the Major's team raise their weapons.]

     CHUCK
     It's Colonel Sheppard's IDC, ma'am.

     WEIR
     Lower the shield!

   [She runs down the steps.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Sheppard and Teyla walk through the Stargate.]

     SHEPPARD
     Someone get us some vests and guns.

     MAJOR
     Colonel. Teyla.

     SHEPPARD
     Major.

     MAJOR
     We were just about to come get you guys. Where-where's Ronon?

   [Someone gets the guns and vests and hands them to Teyla.]

     SHEPPARD
     He's still back there. Did McKay get through okay?

     WEIR
     Yeah, he's gonna be fine. What happened?

     TEYLA
     Ronon bargained for our freedom.

     SHEPPARD
     By sticking a knife to his own throat. We're going back.

     WEIR
     (to Control Room)
     Dial the 'gate!

     SHEPPARD
     It took us fifteen minutes to get to the 'gate.

     TEYLA
     (loudly, so all the team can hear)
     The place could be crawling with Wraith by now.

     MAJOR
     Let's go get him.

   [The Stargate dials.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A hive ship orbits a planet.]

   INT--WRAITH SHIP THRONE CHAMBER

   [Two guards drag Ronon to the throne room. He is conscious, but can
   only give a token resistance. They force him to his knees before the
   Wraith sitting on the throne.]

   [The Wraith, an older, bald Wraith steps down from his throne and
   growls at Ronon. Ronon appears to recognize the Wraith, and is
   frightened of him.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DUSK

   [The Atlantis teams search the village. The encampment is mere debris
   and the remnants of fire.]

     SHEPPARD
     (incredulous)
     We couldn't have been gone for more than a half-hour!

     TEYLA
     (soberly)
     It doesn't take long.

   [They come across Keturah's body. Teyla checks, but he is dead.]

     TEYLA
     As we suspected, the deal did not go as planned.

   [The major approaches, carrying some items.]

     MAJOR
     There's a few dozen bodies here, at most.

     TEYLA
     The rest were culled.

     MAJOR
     We found these.

   [He hands Sheppard Ronon's gun and holster. Sheppard looks around,
   clearly worried.]

     TEYLA
     We'll find him.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship drops out of hyperspace and approaches a planet.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP LAB

   [While the head Wraith watches, a Wraith scientist picks up a tracking
   device with forceps. He heads over to Ronon, who is shirtless, panting
   in pain and strapped prone onto a table.]

     WRAITH
     I once fed from the humans of your homeworld. That is where I will
     watch you die.

   [Ronon winces in pain as the tracker is inserted. He is once again a
   runner.]

   EXT--SATEDA, DAY

   [A dart flies over the ruins of the Satedan city on a cloudy day. It
   uses its transport beam.]

   EXT--SATEDA STREET, DAY

   [A kneeling Ronon is deposited on the street by the beam. He stands and
   stares around him.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Explosions rock the street where Ronon stands as a Wraith dart
   bombards the area.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon continues to look around, lost in his memories.]

   FLASHBACK

   [After the dart passes, Ronon leaves his cover and calls to his squad.
   He is dressed in a Satedan military uniform.]

     RONON
     All right, boys! Let's go! Move, move, move!

   [He shoots cover fire while the squad escapes and the dart again comes
   closer.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon starts running through the street, ignoring the rubble strewn
   around him. He climbs the fire escape of a building to get a higher
   view. He looks out on the ruins. As he turns, he winces upon hearing an
   explosion. A Wraith dart has dropped a bomb.]

   [A few moments later, the dart beams a Wraith soldier onto the Sateda
   street. The Wraith wears goggles and looks around. He growls, then
   pulls his weapon and moves out.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DUSK

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Sheppard, Teyla, McKay, Beckett, and Weir are all in the conference
   room.]

     SHEPPARD
     He's alive.

     BECKETT
     Don't get me wrong, I hope he is, but how can you be certain?

     TEYLA
     They made a sport out of trying to kill him in the past.

     SHEPPARD
     He was the one that got away.

     TEYLA
     I believe they will try again.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon will not go down easily.

     WEIR
     But they must know how dangerous he can be. It's not like they're
     going to give him a fair chance.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, obviously, we don't have much time.

     WEIR
     How do we find him?

     TEYLA
     If the Wraith place a tracking device in him the way they did last
     time...

   [She looks to Sheppard. He turns to McKay.]

     SHEPPARD
     Can you pick up a signal?

     MCKAY
     (rolling his eyes)
     Of course. If it sounds like it might be impossible, you look at me.

     BECKETT
     We still have the tracking device we took out of him.

     MCKAY
     (thinking)
     I might be able to tune the long-range sensors to pick up any
     similarly generated subspace transmissions.

     WEIR
     Good.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but...we are still assuming that the Wraith actually put
     another one in him.

     SHEPPARD
     I'll take whatever odds I can get.

   INT--RUINS OF RONON'S HOME

   [Ronon picks through glass and debris, searching for a weapon. He finds
   a sharp metal shard that can be used as a knife and studies it.]

   FLASHBACK

   [He remembers making love to Melena in a bed in the home. He remembers
   waking up next to her in the morning. Later, she looks angry, dressed
   and standing at the foot of the bed. She grabs his arm.]

     MELENA
     Ronon!

   [She stands before him looking heartbroken.]

   [Later, he recalls her standing at the end of a lighted hallway and an
   explosion engulfing her in flames.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon continues to scavenge. He finds a metal pipe. He tears some
   fabric. While wrapping the rod with the fabric, he hears the door
   open.]

   [The Wraith heads down the stairs. It checks the tracking device
   monitor on its wrist. Ronon is nearby. It growls and takes off its
   goggles, heading further in. It opens another door and snarls. It
   closes the door behind it, engulfing the room in darkness. The Wraith's
   eyes glow an iridescent blue as it scans the area with its night
   vision. Suddenly Ronon attacks it from the front. Taken by surprise,
   the Wraith can't get a shot off in time. Ronon deflects blasts as they
   fight hand-to-hand, alternately in the dark and lit by the small
   generator their blows keep sparking against.]

   EXT--STREET

   [The door slams open, and Ronon exits, still filled with adrenalin from
   the battle. By his posture, it appears he has killed the Wraith.]

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [Sheppard enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     McKay?

   [He looks around.]

     MCKAY
     I'm here.

   [Sheppard heads towards the sound of McKay's voice. He finds McKay
   lying prone on the floor of his lab, a laptop computer in front of him.
   The tracking device is set up on equipment next to McKay.]

     MCKAY
     You know, you really don't appreciate the simple things in life,
     like, uh...sitting.

   [Sheppard sits on the floor next to him.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't envy you. It must be a real pain in the ass.

     MCKAY
     (groaning)
     How long did you work on that?

     SHEPPARD
     Longer than I care to admit. How's it coming?

     MCKAY
     I think I'm almost there.

   [Sheppard studies the device.]

     SHEPPARD
     Is this thing active?

     MCKAY
     Don't worry. I limited the power, so it won't transmit our location
     to the Wraith. I just needed enough juice to determine the subspace
     frequency it broadcasts on. And now...I need to re-calibrate the
     city's long-range sensors to pick up on it.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but, these sensors only cover a small corner of the galaxy.

     MCKAY
     (impatient)
     Unless they're calibrated to pick up a signal being transmitted
     using subspace. How about I leave the bad jokes to you, and you
     leave the brilliant science stuff to me?

     SHEPPARD
     So, uh...what are we looking at?

   [A display of various white dots appear over a grid of space on the
   monitor.]

     MCKAY
     These dots represent transmitters broadcasting from various
     locations in the Pegasus Galaxy.

     SHEPPARD
     (counting)
     So there are...seven runners out there right now?

     MCKAY
     We don't know for sure that they're runners....but I'll bet
     anything, that one's Ronon.

   [He points to one dot in the center. The Stargate address displays next
   to the planet location.]

     SHEPPARD
     Why? How do you know?

     MCKAY
     That's Sateda. It's Ronon's home planet.

     SHEPPARD
     That's a good enough place to start.

   EXT--SATEDA, DAY

   [Ronon runs through the city, dodging through buildings. A dart's
   engine is heard in the distance. Ronon heads to an opening into the
   sewer or storm system and drops into it. A small, round robot drone
   follows him, monitoring his progress.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Weir, Caldwell, Beckett, and the rest of Sheppard's team are there.]

     WEIR
     We have no choice. We've been unable to dial into Sateda's Stargate.

     TEYLA
     The Wraith likely disabled it.

     CALDWELL
     Which means if the Wraith are hunting Ronon, there's a very good
     chance that there's a hive in orbit. I shouldn't have to remind you
     the Daedalus has not done well in its last few engagements with
     Wraith hive ships.

     MCKAY
     We drop out of hyperspace; we beam him on board; we get out of
     there.

     CALDWELL
     You know damn well we can't come out of hyperspace and get close
     enough to a planet to beam someone off the surface. We'll be
     detected!...Look, you know I want to help, but I will not put my
     crew and the only ship that we have in this galaxy at risk for one
     man.

     SHEPPARD
     (furious)
     One man who isn't a member of the U.S. military.

     CALDWELL
     I didn't say that!

     SHEPPARD
     (stepping forward and pointing his finger at Caldwell)
     He's a member of my team! And he deserves the same respect as anyone
     on this expedition.

     WEIR
     We don't leave our people out there, Colonel, not if there's any
     chance.

     CALDWELL
     (bitingly)
     Don't...preach to me about leaving people behind, Doctor Weir.

   [The exchange angry looks. Everyone else looks uncomfortable.]

     CALDWELL
     (more calmly)
     I'm just saying it's a very bad risk/reward situation.

     SHEPPARD
     (more calmly)
     Fine. Then just get us close. We'll take a cloaked jumper the rest
     of the way.

     BECKETT
     I'll go with them. Remove the tracking device before we get back on
     board.

     SHEPPARD
     We'll be out of there before the Wraith even know what happened.

     CALDWELL
     I won't bail you out if you get in trouble.

     SHEPPARD
     (with mock innocence)
     You say that as if we're always getting in trouble.

   [He and the team walk past Caldwell, out of the room.]

   INT--SATEDA SEWER

   [Ronon heads down the sewer corridor. Skeletal remains of people in
   Satedan uniforms are ahead of him.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Ronon sees the faces of his squadron as he looks at the individual
   bodies.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [He picks up a weapon lying by one of the bodies.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Ronon leads his squad, the men whose bodies are lying in the sewer in
   the present.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon pauses over one body, then grunts as he takes off the soldier's
   body armor.]

   INT--ARMORY, SATEDA SEWER

   [Ronon enters with a rifle. He starts scavenging for ammunition and
   equipment.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Ronon's squad is in a firefight on a Sateda street. One of his men
   comes to him.]

     RONON'S MAN
     I'm out of ammo!

     RONON
     There's a depot two blocks down! Go!

   [He gestures behind him, and the man heads out.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon rummages through ammunition cases, finding a bandolier filled
   with heavy artillery shells. He puts it on.]

   INT--SEWER

   [A different Wraith, armed this time with a stunner rifle, stalks the
   sewer. It pauses and checks its tracker monitor. It shows Ronon right
   next to it. It looks around, but sees nothing. Slowly its gaze moves
   upward. Ronon has wedged himself into the ceiling above, waiting in
   ambush. As the Wraith spots Ronon, Ronon fires his pistol. Jumping
   down, Ronon ensures the Wraith is dead. He looks around, spinning as he
   hears movement behind him. He sees the small camera surveillance robot
   that was following him earlier. He approaches it.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP THRONE ROOM

   [The Wraith leader watches the camera video while seated on his throne.
   He watches as Ronon gets closer to the camera.]

     RONON
     (over video)
     You're gonna have to do better than that.

   [The Wraith snarls as Ronon walks away.]

   INT--SATEDA SEWER

   [Ronon flicks off the pin from a grenade and throws it behind his
   shoulder. It clatters to the floor, then explodes.]

   FLASHBACK

     CHIEFTAIN
     (voiceover)
     Sateda will not bow to invaders. The time has come for us to put our
     bravery on the line...

   [Ronon enters his home. He is dressed in a simple shirt, pants and
   vest, civilian garb. Melena stands by the radio listening. Ronon looks
   around the room.]

     CHIEFTAIN
     (over radio)
     ...and defend our nation. Our planet.

     RONON
     What are you doing?

     CHIEFTAIN
     (over radio)
     All that we have built these past two centuries since the last
     culling.

     MELENA
     I'm listening to the Chieftain's speech.

     CHIEFTAIN
     (over radio)
     We must stand up...doubt and fears.

     RONON
     Why aren't you packing? I traded every last thing we had to get you
     on Kell's personal staff.

   [He grabs a case and starts throwing items into it.]

     MELENA
     He's a criminal! He's using people's fear for his own gain.

     RONON
     He's a commander, and his staff gets to go through the 'gate.

     MELENA
     (voice breaking)
     The hospital's going to need me.

   [Ronon stops tearing through drawers and swoops his arm across the top
   of the nightstand in a desperate rage.]

     RONON
     There's not going to be any need for hospitals, Melena! That's just
     a bunch of words meant to make the people who don't get to
     leave...think there's a chance for them. We shot down two ships that
     came through the 'gate. Two...small ships. Do you really think
     that's all they're going to send?

     MELENA
     (weeping and shaking her head)
     Of course not.

     RONON
     Ships as big as our city have attacked other planets. No one that
     stays here is going to survive.

     MELENA
     (crying)
     Then why are you staying?

     RONON
     I have no choice.

     MELENA
     Yes, you do! You believe in this fight! You know that they'll
     eventually find us, no matter where we go. Our only hope is to show
     them that we're not worth the effort! To go feed on some other
     planet that won't fight back as hard as we will.

   [He moves past her. She grabs his arm.]

     MELENA
     Ronon! You can't run forever.

   [She looks at him, heartbroken.]

   END FLASHBACK

   EXT--SATEDA STREET

   [A dart beams down another Wraith accompanied by four guards. They are
   all heavily armed as they head out.]

   INT--SATEDA WAREHOUSE

   [Several different pistols and rifles are strategically placed at
   different spots in the warehouse. One of the guards enters. Ronon hides
   waiting behind a large packing case. The guard pauses. Ronon takes the
   opportunity to shoot it with a shotgun-style weapon. The Wraith slams
   into another case with a cry. Ronon again takes cover, reloading his
   rifle. Other Wraith guards are already there, firing their energy
   weapons at Ronon's position. The Wraith in charge of them fires down
   from above.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Ronon's squad is pinned down by enemy fire. One by one, each of his
   companions is killed by a Wraith blast.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [With a primal scream, Ronon rolls over the packing crate barely
   missing getting struck by fire. He shoots off his "shotgun" again, then
   ducks and grabs two pistols he has waiting. He fires, hitting one of
   the Wraith guards. He ducks from more return fire, then reaches for
   another gun, firing and hitting another guard. He slides across the
   floor to reach a machine gun type weapon, exchanging fire with the
   Wraith leading the group, killing him. Ronon drops his weapon as he
   barely misses getting struck by a blast from directly above. Ronon
   kicks the final rifle up into his hand and fires at the last guard
   shooting from the catwalk. Ronon's aim is much better than the guard's,
   and it falls to floor below. Ronon smiles in triumph, then notices a
   device blinking faster and faster on the guard's chest. He runs towards
   the end of the building.]

   EXT--SATEDA WAREHOUSE, DAY

   [The building explodes.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS MESS HALL

   [Sheppard checks a handheld computer as he finishes his meal. Teyla
   enters and heads over to his table.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey.

     TEYLA
     Am I disturbing you?

     SHEPPARD
     No. What's up?

   [He puts away his computer. Teyla sits across from him.]

     TEYLA
     I just wanted to thank you.

     SHEPPARD
     For what?

     TEYLA
     For going after Ronon this way.

     SHEPPARD
     (casually)
     Did you think we wouldn't?

   [Teyla shrugs, uncertain.]

     TEYLA
     He...is an outsider.

     SHEPPARD
     Not to me.

     TEYLA
     I have often felt like an outsider among your people.

     SHEPPARD
     Well...maybe at first, but...you know I've always trusted you.

     TEYLA
     Yes. You...and...Doctor Weir have been very accepting...but this has
     shown me how far you would go, even for someone who is not from your
     world.

   [Teyla smiles. Sheppard shifts uncomfortably.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look...Teyla,...I'm not really good at, uh...actually, I'm-I'm
     terrible at expressing...I don't know what you call it...?

     TEYLA
     ...Feelings?

   [Sheppard shrugs and nods.]

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, sure. Okay. Point is, I don't really have good, uh...

     TEYLA
     ...social skills.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that is why I enjoyed flying choppers in the most remote part
     of my world before all this craziness happened, but, uh...you should
     know. I don't have, uh...

     TEYLA
     ...Friends?

     SHEPPARD
     (defensively)
     No! I have friends.

   [Teyla smiles self-consciously as Sheppard looks away again.]

     SHEPPARD
     You, Elizabeth, Ronon, Carson, even Rodney are the closest thing I
     have to, a...

     TEYLA
     (smiling)
     A family?

     SHEPPARD
     (clearly emotional)
     I'd do anything...for any one of you. If I had to give up my life
     the way Ronon was going to, I would.

   [Teyla smiles compassionately. Sheppard awkwardly reaches out and pats
   Teyla's hand. He sighs and gets up, taking his tray.]

     TEYLA
     Thank you...for everything you meant to say.

   [Sheppard pauses and nods, then heads out.]

   EXT--SATEDA WAREHOUSE

   INT--SATEDA WAREHOUSE

   [Small fires still burn in the shell of the warehouse. Ronon painfully
   climbs out of the debris. Limping, he heads out of the building, still
   carrying one large gun.]

   INT--DAEDALUS INFIRMARY

   [McKay's wound is treated by Beckett.]

     MCKAY
     Oh! Son of a-- You're killing me!

     BECKETT
     I'm not even touching you. Seriously, Rodney, I've never seen such a
     bigger baby in my life.

     MCKAY
     Just...are-are we done?

     BECKETT
     Yes. It looks fine, considering.

   [Beckett snaps off his medical gloves and walks away. McKay climbs off
   the table, exposing his boxer shorts of yellow kiwi fruit before
   re-fastening his pants.]

     BECKETT
     Why'd you come?

     MCKAY
     What do you mean?

     BECKETT
     On this mission. You're injured. You can't even sit down. People
     wouldn't think any less of you.

     MCKAY
     Well, you think that's all I care about? What people think of me?

     BECKETT
     Well, actually...

     MCKAY
     Hey! I am a very caring person.

   [Beckett turns and gives McKay a skeptical look.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, maybe it's not always obvious to everyone, but, um...

     BECKETT
     You care about what happens to Ronon?

     MCKAY
     Yes, of course I do! What makes you think I wouldn't?

     BECKETT
     Oh, I don't know. The fact that you refer to him as "the caveman"
     behind his back.

     MCKEY
     That is a nickname. Buddies have nicknames for each other.

     BECKETT
     Buddies? Oh, you're buddies now, are you?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, more than that, he saved my life. He's like a brother to me.

     BECKETT
     (sarcastic)
     Aye. A brother who got every gene you didn't, and vice versa.

     MCKAY
     You are just jealous of our relationship.

     BECKETT
     Am I? In the year or so he's been with us, have you ever had a
     conversation with the man?

     MCKAY
     (scoffing)
     We have an unspoken bond. I mean, there are things that go deeper
     than words, my friend. Deeper than words. But you wouldn't know
     anything about that, because you never look past the surface of
     anyone, do you?

   [McKay walks away. Beckett smiles after him.]

   EXT--SATEDA HOSPITAL, DAY

   [The injured Ronon limps to the ruined hospital's entrance.]

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Ronon limps down the empty corridor.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Ronon hurries down the corridor, crowded with injured patients and
   harried staff. Ronon searches every face for Melena.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon continues to limp down the corridor, determined.]

   [Ronon continues to hurriedly check every room and individual, becoming
   more frantic.]

     Melena!

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon reaches the end of the empty corridor.]

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL WARD

   [The room is scattered with medical equipment and other debris.
   Exhausted, Ronon drops his gun. He finds some antibiotics, a pair of
   forceps, and a shattered piece of a mirror. He sits down against the
   wall and sets up his mirror. Bracing himself, he pours the antibiotic
   over his leg wound. He cries out in pain.]

   FLASHBACK

     RONON
     Melena!

     PATIENT
     Nurse! Nurse!

   [Ronon enters the ward and spots Melena at the far end. She smiles in
   relief to see him.]

     RONON
     Melena!

   [She cries out as they embrace.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Blood pools near the mirror as Ronon reaches for the debris using the
   forceps. He screams as he pulls on it.]

   FLASHBACK

     MELENA
     Where's your squad?

     RONON
     They're all dead. Kell used us to ensure his own escape. Now come
     on, there's still a chance I can get us out of here. I can get us to
     the 'gate. Even if I can't, I know where to hide.

   [He pulls her arm. She resists leaving.]

     MELENA
     Ronon!

   END FLASHBACK

   [Whimpering, Ronon pulls at the debris. As it comes out, he screams
   again.]

   FLASHBACK

   [Melena nods to a girl lying on the patient bed beside them.]

     MELENA
     What about her? Her parents are both dead.

     RONON
     Come here.

   [Ronon picks up the girl and carries her.]

     RONON
     Come on.

   [He starts heading out of the corridor. Melena still stands by the bed,
   near the windows.]

     MELENA
     Ronon, wait!

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon continues to scream as more blood falls. He finally takes out
   the metal shard embedded in his thigh.]

   FLASHBACK

     MELENA
     What about all these people?

     RONON
     (heart breaking)
     They're all dead.

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon slams his fist against the wall as a release from the agony.]

   FLASHBACK

     MELENA
     (tearfully)
     I can't. I can't, Ronon, I can't go.

   [Ronon begins to cry as he looks at her, pleading.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon weeps.]

   FLASHBACK

   [There is the sound of an explosion. The windows behind Melena implode
   from the force, and Melena is enveloped in flames.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Ronon looks to the broken windows beside him, the place of Melena's
   death. He hears a dart outside and drags himself to look out the
   window. He can see several Wraith guards patrolling the street below,
   heading inside the hospital. He turns to see the floating surveillance
   camera watching him again.]

     RONON
     (over video)
     You're a coward!

   [The Wraith leader snarls at the image.]

   his weapon to the gunfire. He is shocked to find Sheppard and Teyla
   there.]

     SHEPPARD
     Don't look so surprised.

   [Ronon slumps back onto the floor, breathing heavily.]

     TEYLA
     Are you okay?

     SHEPPARD
     Come on. You can thank us later. McKay and Beckett are waiting for
     us in a jumper on the roof.

   [Ronon raises his pistol at Sheppard.]

     RONON
     (threatening)
     Get out of here.

   [Sheppard raises his hands non-threateningly. Teyla continues to watch
   the door.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, hey! I know you've been through a lot, but, uh...

     RONON
     I'm not going anywhere.

     MCKAY

     What is going on down there?! You have at least twenty-five Wraith
     closing in on your position from ground level.

   INT--HOSPITAL WARD

     SHEPPARD
     (into radio)
     It seems Ronon doesn't want to leave.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     (into radio)
     Well, too bad! You tell that ungrateful example of unevolved
     humanity that we came all this way to rescue him, so he better get
     off his ass--

   INT--HOSPITAL WARD

     SHEPPARD
     McKay says...he's very hurt you won't come with us.

     RONON
     I can't. Keturah and his people, they had a deal. They traded me for
     their freedom.

     SHEPPARD
     What, you're doing this for them?! Those people?! The ones on the
     planet who turned you over to the Wraith?!

     RONON
     It was my fault they were culled.

     TEYLA
     Ronon...the Wraith didn't honor the deal. Keturah and his village,
     they're all dead.

   [Ronon looks at Teyla in shock.]

     SHEPPARD
     Now, can we go?

     RONON
     No.

     SHEPPARD
     Why not?

     RONON
     (with fury)
     Because I'm going to kill the Wraith responsible for all this.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't suppose he happens to be one of the ones out there that's
     about to come in here?

     RONON
     (weakly)
     No. He's probably still up on the hive.

     TEYLA
     We can't take on a hive ship now.

   [Ronon stares at her with determination.]

     RONON
     We won't have to.

     Ronon wants to take care of a few things first.

   [Beckett shakes his head.]

     MCKAY
     (sarcastic, into radio)
     Oh really? Like what?

   INT--HOSPITAL WARD

   [Sheppard stands over Ronon.]

     SHEPPARD
     Come on. Let's go kill some Wraith.

   [He reaches out his hand for Ronon to take. Ronon clasps it and
   Sheppard helps him to his feet. They stare at each other a moment.]

     RONON
     Just stay out of my way.

   [Ronon starts limping towards the door.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey.

   [Ronon pauses. Sheppard unzips his vest and pulls out Ronon's gun.]

     SHEPPARD
     I thought you might want this.

   [Ronon takes it and heads out the door.]

     SHEPPARD
     You're welcome.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     (into radio)
     What the hell is going on down there?!

     SHEPPARD
     (over radio, quickly, as if talking while running)
     Ronon thinks he can get the head Wraith responsible for all this to
     come down and fight him if we kill all these Wraith first.

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL STAIRWELL

   [Ronon blasts two Wraith down the stairwell, then quickly clambers over
   their bodies as he continues down. Sheppard and Teyla hurry to keep
   up.]

     MCKAY
     (over radio)
     That is the stupidest plan I have ever heard.

     SHEPPARD
     (into radio)
     I don't know. Killing a bunch of Wraith always seems like a good
     idea to me.

     MCKAY
     (over radio)
     They outnumber you twenty-five to three.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BECKETT
     It's actually twenty-two to three...twenty-one.

   [Sheppard and Teyla continue to chase after Ronon, who is not in
   sight.]

     TEYLA
     (into radio)
     And Ronon appears to be quite angry.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     (sarcastic, into radio)
     Oh, well, that evens it out. You do realize that there is a hive
     ship in orbit capable of blowing us all off the face of this planet.

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL

   [Sheppard and Teyla reach the bottom of the stairwell. Wraith come at
   them from both directions, and each shoots their rifle, killing them.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   compartment.]

     MCKAY
     Where do you think you're going?

     BECKETT
     I'm going to help them.

     MCKAY
     What, are you crazy?! You're a doctor!

   [He gets up after Beckett.]

     BECKETT
     What does that have to do with it?

   [Beckett pulls out a large rifle from one of the storage compartments.
   As he turns around with it, McKay tries to tussle it out of his grasp.]

     BECKETT
     What are you doing?

     MCKAY
     I'm going.

     BECKETT
     You can barely walk.

     MCKAY
     I can walk fine, I just can't sit!

     BECKETT
     And you're a terrible shot.

     MCKAY
     Oh, what, and you're Rambo now?

   [They continue to play tug-of-war with the weapon.]

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Ronon stops at a corner and carefully looks around it. Two Wraith
   guards head towards him.]

     RONON

     Oh, man.

   [He notices a door ajar at the end of the hallway facing him. It is
   opening wider. His hand forced, Ronon leaps into the corridor, firing
   at the two guards. Behind him, another guard comes out the doorway.
   Ronon is able to down the two, and while sliding to a stop, turn and
   fire at the third before it can get off a shot.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP THRONE ROOM

   [The Wraith leader snarls his frustration. He watches from video feeds
   by his Wraith guards and witnesses his soldiers being downed one by
   one, some by Sheppard and Teyla. He roars in fury.]

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Teyla and Sheppard run to the end of a corridor, firing their P-90s at
   more guards.]

   [In another corridor, Ronon turns and ambushes three Wraith guards,
   firing with energy and barreled pistols before tossing them aside. As a
   fourth turns the corner, he fires again.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BECKETT
     There's more than one bloody gun; we can both go!

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well someone has to stay with the jumper!

     SHEPPARD
     (over radio)
     That's it. We got 'em all...McKay?

   [A surprised Beckett and McKay stop fighting over the rifle. McKay
   releases his hold and looks over at the HUD.]

     MCKAY
     (into radio)
     Yeah. It's just you guys left. Well...that was quick.

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard gives a self-deprecating smile.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I got six. Teyla got...

     TEYLA
     Eight.

   [Sheppard looks nonplussed for a moment, then straightens.]

     SHEPPARD
     I got nine, Teyla got eight, Ronon got the rest.

   [Teyla shoots Sheppard a look.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP THRONE ROOM

   [Ronon bends close to the camera of a downed soldier.]

     RONON
     (over video)
     You wanna watch me die up close? You're just gonna have to come down
     here and do it yourself.

   [The Wraith leader snarls.]

     RONON
     You want me? Come get me!

   [The Wraith leader roars and storms away, passing through the sheer
   trickle that makes up the video screen.]

     RONON
     I'll be waiting.

   INT--SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

   [Ronon has rejoined Sheppard and Teyla.]

     RONON
     (determined)
     You kill him before I do...I kill you.

     SHEPPARD
     What if he kills you first?

     RONON
     Then you kill him.

     SHEPPARD
     (nodding)
     Got it.

   [He and Teyla exchange looks, then shrug, resigned and follow Ronon.]

   EXT--SATEDA STREET

   [Ronon stands in the street waiting. A Wraith dart flies, swooping low
   before beaming down the Wraith leader. They both make shows of bravado,
   Ronon screaming in rage as he unsheathes his knife and attacks. The
   Wraith leader blocks his tackle easily, knocking Ronon across the
   street into a door.]

   [From a rooftop above, Sheppard and Teyla watch as the Wraith punches
   Ronon in the head before he can rise. The Wraith then pulls up Ronon by
   the hair.]

     SHEPPARD
     I could shoot him right now.

   [The Wraith pulls Ronon to his feet.]

     TEYLA
     I wouldn't.

   [Ronon attacks again. The Wraith either takes or deflects the punches.]

     SHEPPARD
     You really think Ronon would kill me?

     TEYLA
     I think he wouldn't forgive you.

   [Below, Ronon tries to tackle the Wraith. Again the Wraith tosses him
   aside, throwing him across the street where he cracks a post holding up
   a porch. Ronon spits out blood as he tries to get to his feet.]

     SHEPPARD
     I think he'd get over it.

   [Teyla looks up.]

     TEYLA
     The hive has got to be watching. We shoot that Wraith, they'd blast
     us all from space.

   [The Wraith walks over and kicks Ronon. He punches him several times,
   dragging him partly up by Ronon's armorplate to get a good angle. Ronon
   grabs the Wraith's fist as it approaches, using all his strength to
   hold back the blow. Ronon uses the Wraith's force to get himself back
   onto his feet. They break apart and again trade blows; again Ronon is
   knocked down. He tries to crawl away. The Wraith walks over and easily
   pulls Ronon back by the hair, knocking him onto his back. The Wraith
   bends low over him, snarling as he raises his hand to feed.]

   [He is distracted by the jumper uncloaking in front of them.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BECKETT
     If he doesn't like it, he can sue me.

   [Beckett closes his eyes in concentration.]

   EXT--SATEDA STREET

   [Ronon smiles at the Wraith.]

     RONON
     I win.

   [A drone fires from the jumper, slamming into the Wraith and knocking
   him back. They explode as they impact a building. Ronon rolls over to
   protect himself from the blast. He smiles as the jumper turns and backs
   up so the rear ramp is closer to him. Sheppard and Teyla run out of a
   building and drag Ronon to the jumper as blasts fire at them from
   above.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Ronon is dropped onto the floor of the rear compartment as Sheppard
   and Teyla grab handholds.]

     SHEPPARD
     (yelling to closed door to the front)
     Go!

   EXT--SATEDA STREET

   [The jumper flies out of the narrow street as more bombs strike from
   above.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Safely in space, Beckett and McKay head to the rear compartment. Ronon
   is now seated on a bench, Teyla and Sheppard standing beside him.]

     BECKETT
     Everyone okay?

     TEYLA
     We are okay.

     RONON
     Which one of you killed the Wraith?

   [Beckett and McKay exchange grins.]

     BECKETT
     That would be me.

     MCKAY
     My idea.

   [Ronon grits his teeth as he forces himself to his feet and approaches
   in a threatening way.]

     TEYLA
     (warningly)
     Ronon!

   [McKay and Beckett quail.]

     BECKETT
     What? Don't tell me you're not happy that he's dead.

     SHEPPARD
     I had him in my sights, but Ronon said he'd kill me if I shot him.

     MCKAY
     (nervously)
     It was all Beckett's idea.

   [Ronon looks from McKay to Beckett, then pulls Beckett into a bear
   hug.]

     RONON
     Thanks, Doc.

     BECKETT
     Oh.

   [Everyone looks on in wonder.]

     MCKAY
     What, him you thank?

     SHEPPARD
     I could've killed him at any time, but Teyla wouldn't let me.

   [Teyla's grin falls as she glares at Sheppard.]

     RONON
     Thank you. All of you.

   [He slaps McKay gently on the chest.]

     MCKAY
     (mollified)
     Oh, don't mention it.

     SHEPPARD
     It's nothing really. Only killed eleven...twelve Wraith.

   [Teyla rolls her eyes at Sheppard.]

     BECKETT
     How 'bout you sit down, and I get that tracking device out of you...

   [Ronon slumps back onto the bench.]

     BECKETT
     (continuing)
     ...and deactivated before the hive ship gets a bead on us. I take it
     this time, you...won't mind if I give you a sedative.

   [Ronon keels over onto the floor, unconscious.]

     BECKETT
     Or not.

   [He clears his throat and checks on Ronon. Teyla assists. Sheppard
   looks from Ronon to McKay.]

     SHEPPARD
     Who's flying the ship.

   [McKay points to himself.]

     MCKAY
     Me.

   [Sheppard looks at him expectantly.]

     MCKAY
     Oh.

   [McKay heads back to the front compartment to fly the ship.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The puddle jumper flies out of Sateda orbit, cloaking along the way.]

   FADE OUT
