   TEASER

   EXT--NEW ATHOS, DAY

   [The body of Kanaan lies on a funeral pyre. A heavily pregnant Teyla
   stands with the rest of her team, Colonel Carter, and some Athosians
   holding torches.]

     CARTER
     I'm so sorry, Teyla. Kanaan was a good man. He would've made a
     wonderful father.

     TEYLA
     I really thought I could save him.

     SHEPPARD
     You did everything you could. That's all anybody can ask for.

     CARTER
     He's at peace now.

   [Teyla bows her head for several moments, and cries.]

     TEYLA
     All right. I'm ready.

   [The Athosians step forward with their torches. Teyla goes with them.
   She looks at Kanaan one last time, then takes one of the torches and
   lights the pyre. She steps back as the Athosians extend the fire. As
   Teyla watches, Kanaan sits up.]

     KANAAN
     Teyla! Teyla!

     TEYLA

     (horrified)
     He's still alive!

     KANAAN

     (beseeching)
     Help me, Teyla, please! Please help me!

   [Teyla starts forward, but Sheppard and Carter hold her back.]

     TEYLA
     He's still alive! Let me go!

     CARTER
     Teyla, it's too late!

     KANAAN
     Help me, Teyla! Teyla! Teyla! Teylaaaa!

   [The flames surround him, and Kanaan screams in agony.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla awakens in her bed. She looks around in surprise, breathing
   heavily.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Keller briefs Carter.]

     KELLER
     As you know, for some time now, we've been tracking what appears to
     be a new sickness in the Pegasus Galaxy. We don't know exactly when
     or where it started, but so far, we've encountered it on seven
     different planets.

     SHEPPARD
     Make that eight.

   [Sheppard and McKay enter.]

     SHEPPARD
     We just came back from 447. They got it, too.

     KELLER
     Really? The same symptoms?

   [McKay pauses by the medication table, wiping his hands with a
   solution.]

     MCKAY

     Mmm. Starts with respiratory difficulty. Proceeds rapidly to fatal
     organ shut down....
     (notices them all staring)
     Oh, it's, uh, disinfectant.

     SHEPPARD
     We just came back from the bio-screen, Rodney. We were wearing a
     hazmat the whole time, too.

     MCKAY
     Yes, well, it's better safe than sorry.

     CARTER
     Do we have any idea how it's spread?

     KELLER
     Well, that's the strange part. Most of these planets have no regular
     contact with each other. But a few of them do have regular contact
     with other neighboring planets that have been completely unaffected.

     SHEPPARD
     So far.

     CARTER
     How bad is this going to get?

     KELLER
     If I had to make a projection, I'd base it on the evidence from
     M1R-992. There have been no new cases there for some time, which
     would seem to indicate the sickness has run its course.

     CARTER
     And...?

     KELLER
     It killed thirty percent of the population. If those numbers bear
     out on the rest of these planets, we're looking at a death toll of
     about 200,000. That's assuming it doesn't spread out any further.

   [Everyone exchanges concerned looks.]

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Teyla drinks from a mug, looking distracted. McKay comes up behind
   her. He has a small white box wrapped in blue ribbon, which he holds
   behind his back as he approaches her. She starts out of her reverie
   when he arrives.]

     TEYLA
     Rodney! Has Doctor Keller made any progress with her investigation?

     MCKAY
     Unfortunately, not, no. But she-she's still working on it.

   [Teyla notices McKay awkwardly holding his hands behind his back.]

     TEYLA
     What are you...hiding?

     MCKAY
     I um, well, I-I've been waiting for the right time to give this to
     you. Um, and what with everything that's been going on and all, I,
     uh...anyway. Here you go.

   [He gives her the gift.]

     TEYLA
     You didn't have to do this, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Well, think of it as a-as a, kind of a "pre-baby present". Back on
     Earth, there's this company that produces recordings specifically
     for the fetus. The thinking is that, by, listening to the works of,
     say a great composer while still in the womb, the baby will be born
     with a natural predisposition toward musical ability, or in this
     case...science.

   [Teyla opens the box. It holds a MP-3 player and large earphones.]

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I-I recorded some of my reflections on some of my more
     ground-breaking accomplishments and theories...uh, just a couple
     hours worth.

   [Teyla smiles.]

     TEYLA
     You should not have gone to so much trouble.

     MCKAY

     (pleased)
     Oh, it was no trouble at all.

     TEYLA
     Mmm.

   [Teyla packs the gift back into the box, already looking distracted
   once again.]

     MCKAY
     Something wrong?

     TEYLA
     Uh...I was debating whether or not to tell anyone.

     MCKAY
     Oh! Tell anyone what?

   [He sits across from her.]

     TEYLA
     I believe I had a vision last night.

     MCKAY

     (nonplussed)
     A...vision?

     TEYLA
     I saw Kanaan, the father of my son. I believe that he was trying
     to...send me a message, that he's alive. And that I must not abandon
     the search for him and the rest of my people.

   [McKay struggles not to look skeptical.]

     MCKAY
     And-and this was while you were sleeping?

     TEYLA

     (sighing)
     You think it was a dream.

     MCKAY
     Well, I...uh.

     TEYLA

     (insistently)
     I believe it was more than that. It did not feel like a dream.

   [McKay doesn't know where to look. His discomfort is obvious.]

     TEYLA
     I knew you would doubt me. I should not have said anything.

     MCKAY
     Hey, I've been cocooned inside an alien spacecraft, I've had another
     person living inside of me, I've encountered not one, but two
     different versions of myself. So who am I to judge, huh? If you say
     it was a vision, then I believe it was a vision.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [McKay walks with Sheppard down a corridor.]

     MCKAY
     I seriously doubt it was a vision.

     SHEPPARD
     She's had them before.

     MCKAY
     She's had remote contact with the Wraith, never another human.
     Besides, those Athosians have been missing for like, what, six
     months now? Do you really think they're still alive?

     SHEPPARD
     What do you want me to do, Rodney? Tell her to give up hope?

     MCKAY
     At some point, she may not have a choice.

   [They part ways.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla sleeps in her bed. A bright light passes over her. She opens her
   eyes to find her whole bed is now in a forest.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Teyla sits at the edge of her bed, looking around. From nothing,
   specks of light swirl until Kanaan appears before her.]

     TEYLA
     Kanaan!

   [She gets up and walks towards him.]

     KANAAN
     Teyla?

   [He looks at her, surprised to see her pregnant. She grins. Kanaan
   schools his expression to be more somber.]

     KANAAN
     You must help us.

     TEYLA
     How?

     KANAAN
     Save us.

     TEYLA
     Where are you? Where are our people?

   [He pulls off a pendant from around his neck.]

     KANAAN
     You bought me this.

     TEYLA
     Yes.

     KANAAN
     Do you remember where?

     TEYLA
     The village of Croya. Is that where you are?

   [Kanaan drops the pendant into her hand. Her fingers close over it.]

     KANAAN
     Come find me.

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla awakens to find herself sitting up in bed in her quarters, her
   hand still outstretched as if clasping the pendant. She opens her hand
   as if expecting to see the pendant there, but her hand is empty.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard briefs Carter.]

     SHEPPARD
     She says the pendant in her vision is the same one she gave to
     Kanaan before he disappeared.

     CARTER
     So what's the significance?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, uh...I'm not sure.

     CARTER
     Well, what does she want, exactly?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, she bought it from some guy in a village on M2S-181. She wants
     to go back and check it out.

     CARTER
     That's a peaceful trading settlement. I'd be very surprised if they
     had anything to do with the disappearance of the Athosians.

     SHEPPARD
     That's what I said, but she still wants to go. She thinks that
     Kanaan is sending her a message, a clue.

     CARTER
     And what do you think?

     SHEPPARD
     It doesn't matter. It's Teyla, and we owe her one.

   [Carter nods.]

     CARTER
     Okay. But we're stretched pretty thin, dealing with this plague.

     SHEPPARD
     I'll try to make it quick.

   [He leaves her office.]

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--M2S-181 FIELD, DAY

   [Sheppard's team heads to the village.]

     TEYLA
     I purchased the pendant from an artisan in Croya, the village we are
     about to visit. Among the Athosians, it's quite common to present
     such gifts as expressions of admiration and respect.

     RONON

     (to McKay)
     Hey, maybe I'll pick you something up while we're there.

     MCKAY
     Really?

     RONON
     No.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Teyla)
     All right, so we'll ask around, see if we can get some useful intel,
     but if you even begin to sense any danger--

     TEYLA

     (interrupting)
     I'll make straight for the 'gate, leaving you to deal with it.

     SHEPPARD

     (a bit surprised)
     All right, then.

   EXT--VILLAGE OF CROYA, DAY

   [Several merchants ply their wares. Teyla approaches a woman setting
   out her baskets in a booth.]

     TEYLA
     Excuse me. I'm wondering if you can tell me what happened to the
     artisan who used to occupy this space? He specialized in handcrafted
     jewelry--bracelets, pendants, chains...?

     WOMAN
     He's gone.

     TEYLA
     Gone?

     WOMAN
     During the sickness that took the village several weeks back. He and
     some forty others. I'm sorry, child. He's dead.

   [Teyla looks stunned.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Carter enters, heading to Keller.]

     CARTER
     Hey, I hear you have something.

     KELLER
     Yeah. I found out what's making these people sick, and it's
     something we've encountered before.

   [She leads Carter to a monitor showing a display of molecules.]

     KELLER
     It's a unique protein originally created by the inhabitants of a
     planet called Hoff. It was designed to interfere with the Wraith's
     feeding mechanism, making them immune to the process.

     CARTER
     It also killed the feeding Wraith and half the people who took it.

     KELLER
     That's right.

     CARTER
     So this isn't some contagion that spreads naturally.

     KELLER
     No. This is mass murder.

   [Carter sighs.]

   EXT--CROYA VILLAGE, DAY

   [Teyla speaks with a villager, who shakes her head. Sheppard approaches
   as the villager walks away.]

     SHEPPARD
     I think we're done here.

     TEYLA
     Not yet.

     SHEPPARD
     I've given this place the twice-over. Nobody knows anything.

     TEYLA
     Well, perhaps someone does and has not seen fit to come forward yet.
     I was guided here. By showing me the pendant, Kanaan was telling me
     to come to this village.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, you're going through a tough time. You want answers, that's
     understandable, but you might want to consider it's clouding your
     judgment...just a little.

     TEYLA

     (piqued)
     What are you questioning, John? My interpretation of the vision or
     the vision itself?

     SHEPPARD

     (sternly)
     We've been here long enough. If there was something for us to find,
     we would've found it by now.

   [Teyla sighs as Sheppard turns away.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Rodney, Ronon, we're heading out.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Keller briefs Carter, McKay, and Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     Are you sure it's the same protein?

     KELLER
     I ran a side-by-side comparison. It was almost an exact match.

     CARTER
     Almost?

     KELLER
     We're dealing with a new and improved version. The Hoffan drug
     killed fifty percent of the test subjects, and this one only kills
     thirty percent.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, it's still thirty percent too many.

     MCKAY
     How do the populations of eight different planets get inoculated
     with a drug and not even know about it.

     KELLER
     It's possible it was administered through their food and water
     supply. We're running some tests.

   [McKay looks startled.]

     CARTER
     So who's behind this?

     KELLER
     Well, maybe the Hoffans have resumed distribution of the drug, but
     on a much larger scale.

     MCKAY
     They haven't been doing much of anything lately. When the Wraith
     discovered what they were up to, the whole civilization was wiped
     out.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, maybe a few of them survived, and they're planning a little
     payback.

     CARTER
     The random nature of this drug's distribution is clear and
     calculated. It's obviously intended to throw the Wraith completely
     off balance. They have no way of knowing which of their food sources
     have become infected.

     MCKAY
     So it's just a matter of time before they become hungry and cranky.
     Well, I mean, I know I would.

     CARTER
     We need to go back to Hoff. Search what's still standing, see if we
     can shed some light on the situation before another planet's
     targeted.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's go, Rodney.

   [Sheppard leaves. McKay reluctantly follows.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla sits meditating.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Kanaan appears before her.]

     KANAAN
     Teyla...

     TEYLA
     Kanaan. Where are you?

     KANAAN
     I don't know.

     TEYLA
     Who took you?

     KANAAN
     I don't know.

     TEYLA
     How can I find you?

     KANAAN
     You already know where to go to uncover the answers.

     TEYLA
     The village.

     KANAAN
     But you stopped looking.

     TEYLA
     I went. I found nothing.

     KANAAN
     You were close. Please, Teyla. Our time is growing short. We need
     you.

   [He holds out his hand to her. She reaches out to grasp it.]

     TEYLA
     Kanaan.

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla gasps as she opens her eyes, her hand still outstretched.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Carter and Teyla head into her office.]

     CARTER
     And you weren't sleeping?

     TEYLA
     I was in a meditative state, but I was most definitely awake. There
     can be no doubt. This is real.

   [Carter gestures for Teyla to sit in lounge chairs to the side of her
   desk..]

     CARTER
     But you've already been to the planet.

     TEYLA
     We missed something. I am certain of it.

     CARTER
     I want to believe you, Teyla, but I'm a scientist. I'm trained to
     think critically.

     TEYLA
     There is a possible explanation. Kanaan has the gift, the same
     ability that I do.

     CARTER
     The Wraith DNA.

     TEYLA
     Yes. Among my people, the gift is considered useful, but it also
     sets one apart. It can be difficult. Kanaan was the only one who
     could truly understand what it felt like.

     CARTER
     It brought you together.

     TEYLA
     It is something we have shared since childhood.

     CARTER
     But have you ever communicated this way before?

     TEYLA
     No.

   [Carter sighs and shakes her head doubtfully.]

     TEYLA
     I know what this looks like, Colonel. And I know what everyone is
     thinking: "she sees what she she wants to see; she believes what she
     wants to believe." But I assure you, that is not the case.

   [Teyla and Carter study each other.]

     CARTER
     All right. When Colonel Sheppard gets back from Hoff, we'll--

     TEYLA
     I cannot wait. Kanaan said their time is running short. I must leave
     immediately.

     CARTER
     I see.

   [She pauses, and they stare at each other again.]

     TEYLA
     I do not need your permission, Colonel. Unless you intend to
     restrain me...

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Major Lorne, come in.

   [Teyla looks very concerned by Carter's response.]

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Go ahead, Colonel.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Assemble your team. You'll be escorting Teyla back to M2S-181.

   [Teyla sighs with relief.]

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Understood.

   [Carter and Teyla stand.]

     CARTER

     (to Teyla)
     I'm not letting you go back there alone.

     TEYLA
     Thank you, Colonel.

     CARTER
     Call me Sam.

     TEYLA
     Thank you, Sam.

   EXT--HOFF, DAY

   [The city consists of bombed out buildings.]

   INT--HOFF LIBRARY

   [McKay looks around scattered papers and debris.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Rodney, come in.

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Did you find anything?

     MCKAY

     (into radio
     Just a bunch of junk, you?

   EXT--HOFF STREET, DAY

   [Sheppard patrols a street.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Nothing. The Wraith did a pretty good number on this place.

     MCKAY

     (over radio)
     Yeah, this is more than just random destruction. This place used to
     be the repository of all Hoffan knowledge.

   INT--HOFF LIBRARY

     MCKAY

     (continuing, into radio)
     I'd say a lot of it's just missing.

   [There is a clatter from behind McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Who's there?

   [The rest of the Sheppard and McKay conversation takes place between
   their respective locations.]

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney, what's going on?

     MCKAY
     I thought I heard something.

     SHEPPARD
     Relax. Probably just rats.

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     Rats?

   [McKay warily approaches the area where he heard the sound.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, if there's someone in here, you better come out.

   [There's another clatter.]

     MCKAY
     I'm not kidding!

   [He heads down what used to be a row of book stacks. He peers in,
   seeing movement. Suddenly several children come out from where they're
   hiding and make a run for it.]

     MCKAY
     Hey! Whoa! Hey!

   [The children get by him before he can do anything. He sighs, then
   spots one boy running from another row of book stacks.]

     MCKAY
     Hey!

   [McKay heads him off. The boy stares at him, petrified.]

     MCKAY
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. I'm not going to hurt you. I just
     wanna ask you a couple of questions. Now, who are you? What are you
     doing here?

   [The boy looks around, still frightened.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for medical stuff: books,
     files, equipment...

     BOY
     I don't know anything about that. By the time we got here, most of
     the good stuff was already gone. We're just picking through what's
     left.

     MCKAY

     (keying radio)
     Sheppard!

   [The boy takes advantage of McKay's distraction and escapes.]

     MCKAY
     Whoa!

   [He sighs and rolls his eyes as the boy disappears around the corner.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Looks like we're not the only ones here.

   [The conversation switches between McKay's and Sheppard's locations.]

     SHEPPARD
     What do you got?

     MCKAY
     A bunch of kids going through what's left of the place.

     SHEPPARD
     Scavengers. You think they got a hold of what we're looking for?

     MCKAY
     Nah, Hoffan research wouldn't have meant anything to them.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, then, if not them, then who was it?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. One thing's for sure, whoever has it knew exactly what
     they were looking for.

   EXT--CROYA, DAY

   [Lorne and his team walk with Teyla through the village.]

     LORNE
     Hmm...Kind of reminds me of the flea markets they used to have back
     home. Every Sunday, stroll down to the Bay area, find pretty much
     anything you wanted...and a lot of things you didn't.

   [He looks at a merchant putting out a particularly ugly lamp. Teyla
   gets distracted by a merchant selling jewelry to a man.]

     LORNE
     What is it?

   [Teyla does not respond. She unsheathes her knife and heads to the
   merchant. Lorne follows.]

     LORNE
     Teyla?

   [Teyla reaches the vendor's stall.]

     TEYLA

     (to customer)
     Leave!

   [The customer takes one look at Teyla's fierce expression and the knife
   she wields and takes off. Teyla immediately holds her blade to the
   startled merchant's neck.]

     TEYLA
     I will ask you once, and you will answer me truthfully. Where did
     you get this pendant?

     MERCHANT
     From a trader. If you like it that much, it's yours with my
     blessings.

   [Teyla snatches the pendant and steps back. She looks at it. It is the
   same stone pendant with a marking that she saw in her vision.]

     LORNE
     You recognize it?

     TEYLA

     It belonged to Kanaan.
     (to merchant)
     What else did you acquire from this trader?

   [The merchant purses his lips, but reaches back and sets out a wooden
   box. Teyla opens it and starts rummaging through it.]

     MERCHANT
     You know, I don't want to be difficult here, but I did acquire that
     merchandise for a price. And while I really don't mind gifting you
     with an item, from a purely business standpoint, it really doesn't
     make sense for me to part with my stock--

   [Teyla ignores the merchant and turns to Lorne.]

     TEYLA
     This necklace belonged to Belara. It was a gift from her parents to
     mark her coming of age. And this ring--belonged to Halling.

   [The merchant rolls his eyes.]

     LORNE
     The trader you say you got these things from, when's the last time
     you saw him?

     MERCHANT
     Several days ago, but he comes through here quite regularly. In
     fact, it's more than likely he may pay me a visit today. It would be
     my pleasure to make you the proper introductions.

   EXT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon arrive in the control room. Carter is
   there.]

     CARTER
     Anything?

     SHEPPARD
     No. The place was cleared out.

   [McKay notices the monitor display.]

     MCKAY
     Is that what I think it is?

     CARTER
     It's getting to be a familiar sight.

     RONON
     What is it?

     CARTER
     Wraith subspace tracking device. It's our old friend.

     MCKAY
     Todd.

     CARTER
     Maybe he wants to talk, and maybe he just wants to lead us into an
     ambush. There is always that possibility.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, there's only one way to find out.

   [Sheppard and Ronon head out.]

     MCKAY

     (whining)
     Aw, come on, we just got back.

     CARTER
     Sorry, Rodney.

     MCKAY

     (pouting)
     I haven't even had lunch yet.

   [He follows the others.]

     CARTER

     (to Chuck)
     Dial it.

   EXT--CROYA, DAY

   [The jewelry merchant sees his dealer approaching and catches Lorne's
   eye as the dealer approaches. Lorne saunters over as the dealer takes
   items out of a satchel.]

     DEALER
     Got some real nice merchandise for you today, my friend. Real nice.

     LORNE
     Hey there. How you doing? You mind telling me where you got this
     stuff?

   [The dealer looks between Lorne and the merchant. He sneers, then makes
   a run for it. He runs through the village, abruptly stopped by running
   into a large branch. He falls unconscious to the ground as Teyla steps
   from concealment, still wielding the branch.]

   INT--ABANDONED HOME, DAY

   [The dealer is tied to a chair. Water is poured on him, shocking him
   back to consciousness. Lorne looms over him.]

     LORNE
     Wake up! Look, we need to know where you got this merchandise?

   [The dealer looks at Lorne's team surrounding him.]

     DEALER
     I do trade so much, it's often hard to keep track of it all.

     LORNE
     Oh yeah? Well according to the merchant you do business with here,
     the stuff you've been bringing in lately has been a helluva lot
     nicer than your usual crap.

     DEALER
     He said that?

     LORNE
     Yeah, he said that.

     DEALER
     Well, there's no accounting for taste. I can't give up my sources.
     They're trade secrets.

     LORNE

     (in intimidating tone)
     I don't give a damn about your trade secrets. We want to know where
     you got this stuff.

     DEALER
     And if I don't tell you, what are you going to do? I recognize those
     uniforms, I've heard the stories. People from Atlantis, do-gooders
     of the galaxy. You wouldn't hurt me.

   [Teyla steps out of the shadows.]

     TEYLA
     I'm wearing no uniform.

     DEALER
     A pregnant woman, Very intimidating.

   [Teyla calmly stands over him and pushes him in the chest with her
   stick. He falls onto his back.]

     TEYLA
     I will inform the villagers that you are a Wraith worshipper, and
     let them mete out their own justice. Let's go.

   [Lorne and Teyla start to leave.]

     DEALER
     Wait! Wait.

   [They turn back.]

     DEALER
     I got it at an off-world dumping ground.

     LORNE
     Dumping ground? For what?

     DEALER
     Corpses mostly. Loose ends that need to be disappeared. Occasionally
     they may still have some valuables on them--valuables they obviously
     have no use for!

     LORNE
     This merchandise...you removed it from the dead?

     LORNE
     No! Not that merchandise. The last time I was back on the planet, I
     spotted what I thought was a fresh grave, a potential new
     opportunity. But when I dug it up, instead of finding a body, I
     found a box containing those items. I suppose somebody was just
     trying to get rid of them. It was odd to me at first, but I wasn't
     just about to--

     TEYLA
     You will take us to this world. You will show us where you found
     them.

     DEALER
     Of course. Whatever you say.

     LORNE

     (to his team)
     Get him up.

   EXT--WRAITH OUTPOST, DAY

   INT--WRAITH OUTPOST

   [Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay spread out within shouting distance and
   investigate the outpost.]

     RONON
     Sheppard. We got something.

   [Sheppard and McKay join Ronon, who enters a room where two dead Wraith
   guards lie.]

     RONON
     Well, they're dead. But there's no marks on them.

     TODD
     That's because they were poisoned.

   [They turn and raise their weapons as Todd comes into view.]

     TODD
     And I suspect you already know how.

   EXT--M2S-181 FIELD, DAY

   [Teyla, Lorne's team, and the dealer head to the Stargate. Lorne is in
   front with Teyla.]

     LORNE
     The first thing we do when we get back to the 'gate is radio back to
     Atlantis. Let them know where we're going, okay?

   [Teyla nods her agreement. Behind them, the dealer looks around
   nervously, as if expecting something.]

     LORNE
     Listen, Teyla, I know you're looking for answers to what happened to
     your people, but I'm thinking, maybe it's better if you let us check
     it out, okay?

     TEYLA
     Major...

     LORNE
     Look, just let us scout ahead, all right?

   [Teyla swiftly turns as an engine whines overhead.]

     LORNE
     What is that...? Dart!

   [The dart swoops. Everyone spreads out away from his path except for
   the dealer, who grabs Teyla and forces her into the path of the culling
   beam. The dart flies away before any of Lorne's team can get a shot.]

   INT--WRAITH OUTPOST

   [The team have lowered their weapons, but are still wary.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, let me guess...something they ate?

     TODD

     (carefully)
     Many of my fellow Wraith have fallen victim to this attack on our
     food supply.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, it's a shame, but it's not really our problem.

     TODD
     From what we have been able to surmise, this blow against us has
     been delivered at great cost to human lives, something you would've
     made your problem in the past...Unless, of course, you're
     responsible for the dispersal of this plague. In which case, you may
     well consider the human lives sacrificed...acceptable losses?

     SHEPPARD
     Actually, when we were putting a list together of most likely
     suspects, you were at the top. What better way to stick it to your
     competition?

   [Todd chuckles.]

     TODD
     Effective, yes, and admittedly creative. But the truth is, all of
     the existing Wraith factions have been adversely affected by this.
     Our food supply has been so randomly tainted, we have no way of
     knowing if our next meal will be our last.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, times are tough. Doesn't explain why you called us here.

     TODD
     I brought you here, because I need your help. I am aware you had a
     hand in helping the Hoffans refine this drug. I require whatever
     research you possess in order that I may synthesize a cure for my
     hive, and my hive alone.

     SHEPPARD
     That's not going to happen.

     TODD
     You always say that, but you always come around.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, this is different. You know, we're still a little upset
     over the whole, uh, "Earth conquest" thing.

     TODD

     (protesting)
     I had no part in that.

     MCKAY
     Actually, in an indirect way you did. The Wraith who led the attack
     was able to access the Midway Station with information that you
     stole on your last visit to Atlantis.

     TODD
     Information he stole from me in turn! So in a way, we were both
     victims. But let's save our commiserations for another time. I have
     a proposal.

   [The team looks skeptical.]

     SHEPPARD
     Let's hear it.

     TODD
     In exchange for this information, I will give you the identity of
     the individual responsible for disbursing this poison, and killing
     both Wraith and human alike.

     RONON
     Huh. A couple minutes ago, you thought we did it.

     TODD
     There are only two parties who possess the resources and
     capabilities to launch such an attack. If you are not responsible,
     then, by process of elimination, there can be only one.

   EXT--SPACE

   [A Wraith hive ship' flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--BRIG, HIVE SHIP

   [Teyla waits alone in a cell. Michael approaches. Teyla's eyes widen in
   alarm.]

     TEYLA
     Michael..?

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard, McKay, Ronon, and Keller brief Carter.]

     MCKAY
     Well, according to Todd, every Wraith faction has been hit, which
     makes it extremely unlikely that any of them are responsible.

     SHEPPARD
     When we told him we weren't the guys behind it, he said there can be
     only one other.

     CARTER
     And you think you know who he's talking about?

   [Sheppard nods.]

     SHEPPARD
     Michael.

     KELLER
     The Wraith Doctor Beckett converted into a human?

     MCKAY
     Well, temporarily converted. Eventually, he became kind of
     a...human-Wraith hybrid.

     SHEPPARD
     The other Wraith didn't want anything to do with him, so he's been
     kind of holding a little bit of a grudge ever since.

     MCKAY
     He's not a big fan of humans either. No, for him, the Hoffan drug is
     the perfect weapon.

     CARTER
     Still, this is just speculation. I mean, do we have any proof?

     MCKAY
     Well, not really, but even if we did, we'd have no way of finding
     him.

     SHEPPARD
     We can go back to Todd, see if he's got something more than a name.

     KELLER
     Well, wait, you're not seriously thinking of...giving him our
     research on the Hoffan protein?

     MCKAY
     Well, why not?

     KELLER
     Because! We'd effectively be giving the Wraith the means to
     reproduce the drug and potentially infect and kill millions.

     MCKAY
     Theoretically, yes. But practically, it really wouldn't be in their
     best interest to poison their own food supply, regardless of whether
     our research helped them come up with an antidote or not. No, I
     think the more likely scenario is that they find an antidote that
     works as a short-term solution to the existing threat. Then they
     work on weaponizing the protein. You know, coming up with a more
     effective delivery system, one that cuts out the middle-man, in this
     case the human victims? No, what we're doing? Is giving them the
     means to kill each other off.

   [While McKay has been speaking, the others exchange nervous looks.]

     SHEPPARD
     So, when you, uh...put it that way, giving them our research could
     be a good thing.

     CHUCK

     Incoming wormhole.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

     CARTER
     Major, where's Teyla?

   [Lorne looks downcast.]

   INT--BRIG, HIVE SHIP

     TEYLA

     (biting down panic)
     Why am I here? What do you want? Answer me!

     MICHAEL
     I'm disappointed. I was expecting a little more gratitude, after
     everything I went through to arrange this "family reunion."

     TEYLA
     Reunion? My people...you took them?

   [Michael tilts his head in a gesture of assent.]

     TEYLA
     Where are they?! What have you done with them.

     MICHAEL
     They're alive and well, and working with me toward the common goal
     we all share.

     TEYLA
     What are you talking about?

     MICHAEL
     The extermination of the Wraith. I'm building an army that will soon
     replace them as the dominant race in this galaxy.

     TEYLA
     An army of monsters.

     MICHAEL
     I'll admit, my early attempts were a little...crude, but that's all
     changed now. I've refined the retrovirus to create the perfect
     balance--ability well beyond any normal human, but without the one
     weakness that will be the downfall of the Wraith.

   [Michael raises his right hand, his feeding hand. It looks like a human
   limb, with no Wraith mutation.]

     MICHAEL
     The need to feed.

     TEYLA
     It was you. You're the one responsible for spreading the Hoffan
     drug.

     MICHAEL
     Consider it the opening salvo in a much broader assault.

     TEYLA
     How were you able to discover the drug?

   [Michael starts to walk away.]

     TEYLA

     (calling after him)
     How were you able to refine it?

   [Michael pauses and turns around.]

     MICHAEL
     I had help.

   [He smiles and walks away.]

     TEYLA
     Wait! Where are my people?! Michael!

   EXT--WRAITH OUTPOST, DAY

   INT--WRAITH OUTPOST

   McKay and Ronon aim guns at them. Todd enters.]

     TODD
     Oh, don't mind them. They're just here to help with the clean-up.

   [Sheppard nods, and the others lower their guns. The drones finish
   pulling the dead Wraith out.]

     TODD
     I assume you've agreed to my terms?

     SHEPPARD
     Not exactly.

     TODD
     You do not wish to know who's responsible for these...unfortunate
     events?

     MCKAY
     We already know. At least, we have a pretty good guess.

     SHEPPARD
     We call him Michael. Don't ask why. He used to be a Wraith. Now he's
     a...I'm not sure what the hell he is.

     TODD

     (smiling)
     I know the one of whom you speak, and I believe you are correct.

     SHEPPARD
     Confirmation. Without us giving you anything. That's very generous.

     TODD
     Obviously, there's more you want from me, or you would not have
     come.

     RONON
     Maybe we just came to kill you.

   [Todd's eyes widen.]

     TODD
     Did you?

     SHEPPARD
     Unfortunately, no.

   [The Wraith huffs a laugh.]

     TODD
     Well, there's always next time.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     One of our people, Teyla, was taken by a dart today.

     TODD
     I suppose she's already made some lucky Wraith a very tasty meal.

     MCKAY
     This was no culling. She was targeted. Someone set a trap.

     TODD
     And you suspect this...what do you call him? Michael?

     SHEPPARD
     Well if not, the timing's a helluva coincidence. We need you to tap
     your intel sources, find something useful.

   [McKay reaches behind him into his pack and pulls out a tablet
   computer.]

     MCKAY
     This tablet has the address of an off-world relay station. If you
     leave a message for us, we'll get it. It also has our research on
     the Hoffan drug.

     TODD
     Ah!

     SHEPPARD
     Just enough to whet your appetite. You find something we can use,
     we'll give you the rest.

     TODD

     (pleased)
     Well, I'll see what I can do.

   [They part ways.]

   EXT--SPACE

   INT--BRIG, HIVE SHIP

     MICHAEL
     I understand you're refusing to take food. It's not poisoned if
     that's what you're worried about.

   [He eats some himself. Teyla merely glares at him.]

     MICHAEL
     Take it. You need to keep up your strength.

   [He holds the bowl out between the bars. Teyla knocks it away.]

     TEYLA
     What do you care about my well-being?

     MICHAEL
     I care a great deal. I may not be foolish enough to consider us
     friends, but we do have a history. And even though you've betrayed
     me repeatedly, you're still the only one, human or Wraith, who's
     ever come close to understanding what I've been through.

     TEYLA
     Really?

     MICHAEL
     We're not that different, Teyla. You're a human with Wraith DNA--a
     hybrid, just like me.

     TEYLA
     I'm no murderer.

     MICHAEL
     You kill to protect yourself and your own, so do I. Of course,
     circumstances require me to do it on a slightly larger scale, but
     the principle is still the same.

     TEYLA
     You're insane.

   [Michael seems sincerely hurt by her rejection.]

     MICHAEL
     Spite me all you want, but don't do it at the expense of the child.

   [Teyla looks frightened.]

     TEYLA

     (fiercely)
     My child is of no concern to you.

     MICHAEL
     On the contrary, I have great plans for him.

     Are you kidding? This is the first decent meal I've had all day.
     Besides, it's not going to help Teyla at all starving ourselves. I'm
     just trying to, uh, keep my strength up. I suggest you two do the
     same.

   [Ronon notices Sheppard fidgeting restlessly.]

     RONON

     (to Sheppard)
     Hey, we'll find her.

     SHEPPARD
     I've just got to do something.

   [Carter approaches.]

     CARTER
     Colonel...it looks like Todd came through for you.

     MCKAY
     He did?

     CARTER
     We just got a message from the relay station. Apparently there's a
     rumor going around amongst certain Wraith worshippers about one of
     our people being held captive. You've got the coordinates.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, I'm going to need Lorne and his team.

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     He's already volunteered. You'll 'gate to the nearest planet where
     the Daedalus is en route to pick you up.

     TEYLA
     Kanaan.

   [She approaches the door, spotting that Kanaan is a hybrid like
   Michael. He looks at Teyla with no emotion.]

     TEYLA
     What has he done to you? Kanaan, it's me, Teyla. I came for you,
     just like you asked.

     MICHAEL
     Like I asked.

   [Michael comes to stand next to Kanaan.]

     MICHAEL
     I was the one in your visions. Appropriately disguised, of course.

     TEYLA
     You're lying.

     MICHAEL
     I reached ten thousand light years of space and touched your mind.
     There is more of a bond between us than you know. Once the child is
     born, the bond will grow even stronger. Enjoy your reunion.

   [He leaves Teyla and Kanaan alone.]

     TEYLA
     Kanaan, you must help me. You must help our child. Please, Kanaan.

     SHOOTER
     We're expecting him back. He's on his way with an important
     prisoner.

   [Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay exchange concerned looks as they realize.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Daedalus, this is Sheppard, come in. Daedalus, do you read?

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The conversation switches between the lab and the Daedalus.]

     CALDWELL
     Sheppard, this is Daedalus.

     SHEPPARD
     Do not destroy the enemy ship! I repeat, do not destroy the enemy
     ship, Teyla may be aboard! Did you hear me? Teyla may be on board!

     CALDWELL

     We heard you.
     (to helmsman)
     Can you cripple it?

     FEMALE HELMSMAN
     It's possible, sir. It's already sustained some heavy damage. Sir,
     the enemy is attempting a retreat.

     CALDWELL
     Target the engines!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus fires at the Wraith ship, but it takes evasive action and
   jumps into hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     FEMALE HELMSMAN
     I'm sorry, sir.

     CALDWELL

     (into radio)
     Bad news, Sheppard. The cruiser made the jump to hyperspace. It's
     gone.

   INT--LAB

   [Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon exchange sorrowful looks.]

   [Lorne and his men continue to exchange fire with another shooter. The
   enemy is downed by an energy blast from Ronon's gun. Lorne sees
   Sheppard's team and he waves his men to join them.]

     LORNE
     Any sign of her, sir?

     SHEPPARD
     She's not here.

     LORNE
     Are you sure? That guard was protecting something.

   [They look to the door at the end of the hall. Sheppard's trio takes
   point. Sheppard shoots the lock, and McKay unlatches the deadbolt and
   shifts to the side. They kick the door open, weapons at ready.]

   [The three cannot believe their eyes. Carson Beckett sits on small cot
   at the end of the cell.]

     BECKETT
     Finally. It's about bloody time. What took you so long?

   [He stands and stares at the men.]
