   TEASER

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard paces the room. Ronon sits on the staircase to the jumper
   bay. Both are geared up for an offworld mission.]

     RONON
     Don't worry. We're ahead of schedule.

     SHEPPARD
     I know.

     RONON
     All the settlements we've been assigned have been evacuated.

     SHEPPARD
     I know, I know. It's just that most of the planets that are in the
     Replicators path are people that we've had almost no contact with,
     so I need you and Teyla out there as much as possible.

     RONON
     Yeah, well I think it might be the flu. She's been looking a little
     green lately.

   [Teyla enters, geared up for an offworld mission.]

     TEYLA
     I'm fine. Where are we going to now?

     RONON
     M9R-373.

     TEYLA

     (sighing)
     The Massanians. This should be interesting.

   [They start heading to the stairwell leading to the Stargate.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I'm sorry we're having to go out so much. I know you don't
     feel so hot, but you're the one with al the contacts out there,
     so...

     TEYLA
     It's all right. I'm feeling much better now.

     CHUCK
     Offworld activation!

   [They watch from the top of the stairwell as refugees start to come
   through the Stargate.]

     SHEPPARD
     Must be Lieutenant Kemp's team.

     CHUCK
     Receiving video transmission. Coming in now, Colonel.

   [Sheppard and the others head back to the control room monitor, where
   Kemp appears on screen, crouching to lean into view of the MALP
   camera.]

     SHEPPARD
     Lieutenant, looks like things are going well.

     KEMP

     (over video)
     Most of the settlement's on their way through, but a good number of
     them have decided to stay behind. I'm not sure they believe us, sir.
     I'm requesting Teyla come back and try to talk some sense into the
     stragglers, because I'm not getting anywhere with them.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I don't think we can do that. The Replicator ship's going to
     be there within a half-hour.

     KEMP

     (over video)
     Well, I don't know what to do. They--
     (calling out)
     Incoming!

   [An explosion happens nearby, covering Kemp with dirt. He leans closer
   to the camera.]

     KEMP

     (panicked, into video)
     It's too late! They're already here!

     SHEPPARD

     (worried)
     Lieutenant, get your men through the 'gate!

     KEMP

     (over video)
     I can't! There's too many people...

   [The transmission cuts off. The Stargate shuts down.]

     CHUCK
     We've lost the transmission.

     SHEPPARD
     Dial him back.

   [Chuck dials, but the Stargate does not activate.]

     CHUCK
     I can't get a lock.

     SHEPPARD
     They must've taken out the 'gate.

     RONON
     How many people were left on that settlement?

     TEYLA
     Just under two thousand.

   [They exchange distraught looks.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus and Apollo come out of hyperspace above the New Atlantis
   world.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter stands with McKay and Sheppard in the control room.]

     MCKAY
     Both ships at the same time. This is a first.

     CARTER
     It's the first time we've needed them.

   [Sheppard and McKay shoot her a look.]

     CARTER

     (abashed)
     Well...since I've been here.

   [She grimaces. Ellis and Caldwell beam into the control room, facing
   each other.]

     CALDWELL

     (to Ellis)
     Colonel.

     ELLIS

     (to Caldwell)
     Colonel.

     CALDWELL

     (to Carter)
     Colonel.

     CARTER

     (to Ellis and Caldwell)
     Colonels.

     ELLIS

     (to Sheppard)
     Colonel.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Ellis and Caldwell)
     Colonels.

     MCKAY
     Seriously?

     CARTER

     (ignoring McKay, to colonels)
     Good flight?

     CALDWELL

     (shrugging)
     Long flight.

     SHEPPARD
     We'll make it worth your while.

     ELLIS
     That's what I hear. You have a way of tracking the Replicator ships?

     CARTER
     We do.

     CALDWELL
     That'll make finding and destroying them a lot easier.

     CARTER
     Why don't you come into my office? We'll get you briefed.

   [She leads the way.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [McKay shows several lines of code on a computer monitor. Everyone
   looks bored.]

     MCKAY
     It is this recent discovery of the essential duality of this
     particular stem of the nano-sub-code that has opened up a whole new
     world of possibilities when it comes to the expedient and permanent
     deactivation of the inter-nanite bonds...

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney...

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I-I'll let you know when I'm ready to take questions. Thank
     you.

     ELLIS
     Have you created an anti-Replicator weapon or not?

     MCKAY
     If-if you just let me continue, I-I think you'll have a better
     understanding of the complexity that I'm--

     ELLIS

     (impatient)
     Yes or no, Doctor.

     MCKAY
     Well...no.

   [Carter clears her throat.]

     CARTER
     All right, we move onto Plan B.

     MCKAY
     What, just like that?

     CARTER
     The Replicators are destroying every human colony they can find in
     an attempt to wipe out the Wraith's food supply. We can't wait. We
     have to act now.

     MCKAY
     But Plan B, it's not a good plan.

     ELLIS
     Oh no?

     MCKAY
     Sure, the Apollo and the Daedalus have been retrofitted with the new
     Asgard plasma beam weapons, which given are very, very powerful, but
     they still can't destroy the Replicators.

     CALDWELL
     Well, we don't have to destroy them, we just destroy their ships. I
     mean, from what I understand, once they're exposed to the harsh
     environment of space...they'll essentially be neutralized.

   [Ellis nods.]

     MCKAY
     Well, "essentially neutralized" and "neutralized" are two very
     different things.

     SHEPPARD
     Back when we blasted Niam into space, he froze solid. We didn't have
     a problem until we warmed him up.

     MCKAY
     That's what I'm saying! Look, your way leaves Replicator cells
     inactive, just waiting around for someone to reactivate them. My way
     shuts them down for good.

     ELLIS
     But our way is actually operational. You know, come to think of it,
     what exactly is your way? From what I understand, you haven't even
     gotten your programming done yet, let alone a delivery method.

     MCKAY
     Well, you didn't let me finish my presentation.

   [McKay reaches for the remote.]

     ELLIS
     I think I got the gist of it.

     MCKAY

     (affronted)
     Really?

     SHEPPARD

     (admonishing)
     Rodney...

     MCKAY

     (angry)
     No, no, I'm just wondering when the Colonel here became a math and
     physics expert!

     ELLIS
     Doctor, you came into this meeting knowing that you had nothing. But
     instead of just saying that like a man, you thought that you'd
     dazzle us with a lot of fancy talk and think that we were too dumb
     to notice.

     MCKAY
     Oh, so now you're questioning my manhood?!

     CARTER
     All right, that is enough!

     MCKAY
     No! He just told--

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney...! Move on.

     MCKAY
     Look, I think we've got this tracking system down. We can peg where
     they're going to be within a thirty minute window. And given current
     data, we've got at least twelve hours before any of their ships are
     even close to an inhabited planet. Just give me and the Wraith
     like...ten hours to get this shut-down program working. If I don't,
     then you can just feel free to go ahead and open up on them with
     your "beam weapons."

     CARTER
     All right. You have ten hours. Go.

     MCKAY
     All right.

   [McKay shuts off the monitor and leaves with a final glare at Ellis.
   After he's gone, Ellis turns to Sheppard and Caldwell and shakes his
   head.]

     ELLIS
     I don't understand how you guys put up with--

   [Carter gets in Ellis's face, staring him down.]

     CARTER
     If you ever talk like that to someone under my command again, you
     will not be welcome on this base, Colonel. Is that clear?

   [Ellis studies Carter, then nods.]

     ELLIS
     Yes, it is.

     CARTER
     Good. We're done here. Thank you.

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [McKay works on his equipment. The Wraith stands nearby, under guard.
   It is the Wraith who will later be named Todd.]

     WRAITH
     Why would you lie to them?

     MCKAY

     (protesting)
     I didn't lie to them.

     WRAITH
     It is most improbable that we complete our task within ten hours.

     MCKAY
     That is quitter talk! Look, you don't know me. This is when I'm at
     my best, this is when I shine! Impossible deadlines! Did I ever tell
     you about the time that I once got a damaged Ancient hyperdrive
     system online moments before me and my crew were incinerated by a
     super-volcano?

   [The Wraith rolls his eyes and sighs.]

     WRAITH
     Yes, you have.

     MCKAY
     Well, there you go. See, I work best under pressure.

     WRAITH
     Then perhaps I should threaten to feed on you if we do not complete
     the coding in time.

   [He looms menacingly over McKay. The guards raise their weapons.]

     MCKAY

     Easy, easy. He's just kidding.
     (to Wraith)
     Just, tell 'em you were joking.

   [The Wraith stares at McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Right.

   [He moves over to the other side of the table.]

     MCKAY

     (meekly)
     I'll work in this area.

   EXT--ATLANTIS NIGHT

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [The Wraith and McKay continue to work. Sheppard enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     Time's up.

     MCKAY
     What? So soon?

     SHEPPARD
     I guess that means you're not ready.

     MCKAY
     Well, no, I'm not.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we're going with Plan B. You want to go for a ride?

     MCKAY
     No, no I'll stay here. This still needs to get done. Good luck.

   [Sheppard leaves.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Apollo andDaedalus exit hyperspace in tandem.]

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

   [Ellis sits on the bridge. Marks is at the starboard station, Sheppard
   is at port.]

     ELLIS
     Daedalus, this is the Apollo. Our scans are clear. We don't have any
     other contacts. Can you confirm?

     CALDWELL

     (over radio)
     Copy that, we have the same reading.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Caldwell sits in his chair. The starboard station is occupied by
   Carter.]

     CALDWELL

     (to Carter)
     Colonel, how long before our guest arrives?

     CARTER
     Should be any second now.

     CALDWELL

     Won't they be surprised.
     (into radio)
     We're going weapons hot, Apollo.

     ELLIS

     (over radio)
     Copy that, we have done the same.

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     MARKS
     I'm detecting a hyperspace window opening.

     ELLIS
     Stand by to fire forward beam weapons.

   EXT--SPACE

   [An "Aurora-class" Replicator ship exits hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL
     Fire!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Both 304 ships fire on the enemy vessel, blasting it apart.]

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD
     Contact has been neutralized.

   [Sheppard and Ellis exchange surprised looks.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL
     I wish I'd had these a few years ago.

     CARTER
     Well, the first attack was easy. They didn't know we were coming.
     The Replicators have proven very effective in changing strategies
     when faced with failure.

     CALDWELL
     Still, we took that ship down without even breaking a sweat.

     CARTER
     Right. One down...thirty-seven to go.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   One week later.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Caldwell exits an elevator. Sheppard meets him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Welcome back, sir.

     CALDWELL
     Was in the neighborhood. Thought I'd stop by and resupply.

     SHEPPARD
     How's it going out there?

     CALDWELL
     Splitting us up was a good call. The Daedalus has downed another
     three ships.

     SHEPPARD
     Ellis got another two. That brings us to seven. That's not bad at
     all.

     CALDWELL
     I'll need about an hour to get what we need. Then we'll get back out
     there.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, there's been a little change of plans.

     CALDWELL
     Really?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Ellis is on a video feed. Carter, McKay, Sheppard, and Caldwell all
   stand in the office.]

     ELLIS

     (over video, surprised)
     They're falling back?

     CARTER
     Safety in numbers.

     MCKAY
     Evidently, they haven't figured out how we're tracking them, and--

     SHEPPARD
     Or they haven't figured out how to stop us.

     MCKAY
     Either way, they want to stop losing ships.

     CALDWELL
     So they're all heading back to the Replicator homeworld?

     CARTER
     That's right.

     ELLIS

     (over video)
     Well, that's good. I mean, they're finally all in one place. We can
     wipe them all out at once.

     CARTER
     Ideally, yes. But our two ships versus an entire Replicator fleet...

     SHEPPARD
     Not to mention the drones they'll be firing from the surface.

     CARTER
     Look, the new weapons we have are very effective, but they are no
     match for that kind of firepower.

     ELLIS

     (over video)
     Well, sounds like the perfect time to finally use that killer
     program you've been working on, Doctor.

   [Carter's expression blanks. McKay looks nervous.]

     MCKAY
     Yeah.

     ELLIS
     Remember when you said all you needed was--ten hours to finish it?

     MCKAY
     Vaguely.

     ELLIS
     Well, it's been ten hours--and a week. Are you finished?

     MCKAY
     Well, I'm just, um, dotting some "i's", crossing some "t's"...

     CARTER

     (cutting in)
     Look, whatever our plan is, we need to act quickly. Our current
     intel suggests that they're putting all their resources into
     building new ships. I figure we have less than a week before they
     head back out into the galaxy, and in much greater numbers.

     CALDWELL
     If they start traveling in packs, our kill rate's going to drop
     drastically.

     CARTER
     We can't let that happen. We need to take them out while they're all
     in one place, and we need to do it quickly.

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

   [Everyone looks to McKay. He suddenly realizes their attention is on
   him.]

     MCKAY
     Hey, I should...just get back to my lab.

   [McKay exits.]

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [McKay and the Wraith watch a monitor showing a simulation process.
   When completed, the result shows the simulation failed.]

     MCKAY

     (despondent)
     Oh. I have to tell them. I have to tell them we don't have anything.

     WRAITH
     This is most troubling.

     MCKAY
     Ellis is going to love this. I-I don't get it. We tried
     reconfiguring their stand-down code. We tried programming the
     nanites to turn themselves off. Something should have worked.

     WRAITH
     They are a very complex and ingenious design.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well I thought I was ingeniouser.

   [The Wraith gives McKay a look.]

     MCKAY
     Yes, I know that's not a word, Mister...Helpful. All right, look,
     maybe we could figure out some way to use the anti-replicator guns
     somehow.

     WRAITH
     From what you have told me, they've almost certainly become immune
     to it.

     MCKAY
     Even if they haven't, we'd still have to get them all in one place.

   [McKay is suddenly struck by inspiration. The Wraith notices.]

     WRAITH
     What is it?

     MCKAY

     (distracted)
     I think I've got my first good idea in three weeks.

   [He walks away, leaving the Wraith there.]

     WRAITH
     Hmm.

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [McKay briefs Carter and Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     Our old anti-replicator technology relied on disrupting the bonds
     between each individual nanite cell. They just, uh, collapsed in a
     pile of dust, right?

     SHEPPARD
     We're familiar with the technology, yes.

     MCKAY
     Right. Well, the thinking was always to continue down that line, to
     uh, break the bonds, to turn them off, uh, sever their connections
     to one another. Because dust we can deal with, right?

     CARTER
     Rodney...

     MCKAY
     We do the opposite! Instead of severing their connections, we
     significantly dial up their attraction to one another. We turn each
     cell into an incredibly powerful nanite magnet. You know, one cell
     attracts another cell; those two attract two more. And as more and
     more nanite cells, uh, bond to the core group, they become stronger
     and stronger and stronger. To the point where every Replicator cell
     on the planet, in orbit, all of them, are massed in this-in this-in
     this giant, super-dense blob.

   [He looks at them expectantly.]

     SHEPPARD
     A super dense blob? That's your great idea?

     MCKAY
     It is. Yes, actually.

     SHEPPARD
     So what do we do with the blob, then? Aren't we in danger of
     creating some Godzilla-sized Super-Replicator?

     MCKAY

     (dismissively)
     No. At least not at first. Look, this is not their normal form of
     bonding. I mean, it'll take them some time to adapt, to-to figure
     out how to function within the new parameters.

     CARTER
     How much time?

     MCKAY
     Well, I mean, I'd hate to speculate.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, since when?

     MCKAY
     Look, it doesn't matter anyways, because long before that happens,
     they're going to fuse together so tightly, they will be rendered
     essentially inert. Remember, this bond is occurring on a subspace
     level--

   [Carter stands, intrigued.]

     CARTER
     Which helps them get past the normal repulsive force between
     nuclei...

     MCKAY
     To the point where their electrons are fusing with their protons,
     and once that starts happening, they're toast.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but you're talking about neutron star levels of density.

     MCKAY

     (excited)
     Precisely!

   [Carter blinks, thinking through the idea.]

     CARTER
     Wow. Yeah, it sounds crazy, but...this could work.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, how do we make it work, then? Just upload a new command into
     their base code?

     MCKAY
     I have a better idea.

   [He points to the exit. An intrigued Carter follows, Sheppard bites his
   lip skeptically as he takes up the rear.]

   INT--ANCIENT REPLICATOR LAB

   [McKay leads them into a lab with an Ancient lab table.]

     MCKAY
     Tah-dah!

     SHEPPARD
     What's this?

     MCKAY
     This? This has been in storage since we found it a while ago. The
     Ancients used it as part of their research into the creation of
     human-form Replicators.

   [Carter takes her hands off the table immediately.]

     CARTER
     What are you suggesting?

     MCKAY
     We have the technology. The understanding of nanite coding. I mean,
     we have the Ancients' blueprints, for crying out loud.

     SHEPPARD
     You want to make your own Replicator?

     MCKAY

     Well, not a whole one. Just-just a block of nanite cells say, you
     know, yay big.
     (he mimes a small cube)
     Look, just-just enough to get the ball rolling.

     CARTER

     (dubious)
     I don't know, Rodney...

     MCKAY
     I'm not talking about creating anything with normal Replicator
     abilities. Just a-a group of nanite cells that can serve as a
     platform for us to upload the new bonding program. We take it to the
     Replicator homeworld. We switch it on. We beam it into a populated
     area. We sit back and watch. It couldn't be easier...

   [Sheppard and Carter both give McKay looks.]

     MCKAY
     There is the one problem.

     SHEPPARD
     Only one?

     MCKAY
     The Replicators on the planet will be affected fairly quickly, but
     there will be a definite delay until there's enough mass to attract
     the nanite cells in orbit.

     SHEPPARD
     So those ships will have plenty of time to escape.

     MCKAY
     Unless we disable or destroy them.

     CARTER
     They have thirty ships. We have two.

     MCKAY
     Well, if we don't disable them, they're just going to fly away, lay
     low, and replicate a new army.

     CARTER
     Thirty ships versus two! Can't be done.

   [McKay looks to Sheppard. Sheppard bites his lip, thinking.]

     SHEPPARD
     We might be able to get more ships.

   [McKay looks over to Carter hopefully.]

   INT--BRIG

   [Carter, McKay, and Sheppard talk with the Wraith prisoner.]

     WRAITH
     Depending on what has happened since I have been in captivity here,
     I could easily bring another twelve ships to the battle.

     SHEPPARD
     Twelve ships? Willing to fight shoulder to shoulder?

     WRAITH
     For a chance to destroy the Replicators once and for all? Of course.

     SHEPPARD

     (to others)
     It at least brings the odds down to two-to-one.

     WRAITH
     An alliance like this must be negotiated.

   [Carter nods.]

     WRAITH
     I will need to personally convince them that this is the proper
     course of action.

   [Carter looks wary. The Wraith smiles.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard's team, minus McKay, and several marines escort the Wraith
   prisoner through the halls. The prisoner is wearing wrist restraints
   attached to a belt.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The marines leave the Wraith to Sheppard's team. Ronon pushes it into
   a chair.]

     RONON
     Sit down.

     SHEPPARD
     First sign you've crossed us...

     WRAITH
     I die. I know.

   [He studies Ronon.]

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--SPACE

   [The puddle jumper exits a Spacegate to find seven hive ships
   congregated around.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard winces, looking uncomfortable.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, this is different.

     TEYLA
     Receiving transmission...docking instructions.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, let's get this over with.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper flies into one of the Wraith ships' docking bays.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The team look more and more nervous.]

   INT--WRAITH SHIP

   [The jumper lands.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD
     Now what?

   [There is a knocking from the rear compartment door.]

     WRAITH
     You open the door.

   [Sheppard stands. The Wraith also stands and indicates his restraints.]

     WRAITH
     Perhaps we should remove these. I think it sends the wrong message,
     don't you?

     RONON
     This is a mistake.

     SHEPPARD
     We need his help.

   [Sheppard and Ronon free the Wraith from his bonds.]

     RONON

     (to Sheppard)
     I've got a bad feeling about this.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we're here. Let's see it through.

   [Sheppard opens the hatch door. Several Wraith guards are standing
   there with weapons raised.]

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy guys.

   [The guards open fire, stunning Teyla, Sheppard and Ronon. They strike
   Ronon several times. The Wraith stands over their bodies, looking
   satisfied.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ANCIENT REPLICATOR LAB

   [Zelenka watches McKay work on the control panel. The table itself has
   a large blob of metallic fluid sitting on it, kept on the table by the
   raised edges.]

     MCKAY
     All right, the basic nanite material has been formed. Let's see if
     we can get them to interact.

     ZELENKA
     I must say, Rodney, this is quite an ingenious idea.

     MCKAY

     (smug)
     Would you expect anything less?

     ZELENKA
     Well...

     MCKAY
     Well what?

     ZELENKA
     Well, you have been in a bit of a rut, lately.

     MCKAY

     (petulant)
     I have not.

     ZELENKA
     Okay, like a-like a dry spell, maybe.

     MCKAY
     That is not true.

     ZELENKA

     (patronizingly)
     Okay.

     MCKAY
     It is not!

     ZELENKA
     Okay! Okay. Now are we certain that these nanites will not go beyond
     simple cohesion?

     MCKAY
     Of course. I've disabled most of the normal protocols. They won't be
     able to do anything beyond form a simple block. All right, here we
     go.

   [McKay taps some controls. The liquid forms into a solid cube.]

     ZELENKA
     It worked! You did it, Rodney!

     MCKAY
     Naturally.

     ZELENKA
     McKay's back!

     MCKAY
     Will you stop that? I was never gone!

   [McKay's computer beeps an alert. They both look down.]

     MCKAY
     Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. We've got a problem. The cells
     aren't communicating properly.

   [The cube collapses into the liquid amorphous spill. They sigh.]

     MCKAY
     This could be tougher than I thought.

   [Zelenka starts to speak.]

     MCKAY
     And I don't want to hear you say anything.

   [Zelenka stays silent.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Teyla and Ronon remain unconscious. The Wraith shakes Sheppard awake.
   Sheppard is groggy, forcing himself to lean half sitting on the closed
   jumper door as he recalls what happened.]

     WRAITH
     Be calm. Here.

   [He hands Sheppard his sidearm.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell's going on?

     WRAITH
     Apparently, my fellow Wraith wanted to speak to me without you being
     around.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, they might have just politely asked us to stay in the jumper.

     WRAITH
     Come now. You would never have let me leave your sight.

     SHEPPARD

     (irked)
     Well, we'll never know now, will we?

     WRAITH
     We have a deal. Seven hives will join us in the fight.

     SHEPPARD
     Seven? You said twelve!

     WRAITH
     Not all of them were convinced that the mission was achievable.
     Plus, many of our ships are without queens. We'd be unable to create
     new soldiers should they fall. If you'd prefer none...

     SHEPPARD

     (annoyed)
     All right, seven.

   [He glances at the unconscious Ronon next to him.]

     SHEPPARD
     How did I wake up before Ronon?

     WRAITH
     We had to stun him several times. I thought it would be best that
     you were awake before he was.

     SHEPPARD
     Probably a good idea.

   [Sheppard looks over the Wraith's shoulder at the starfield outside the
   window.]

     SHEPPARD
     Are we in space?

     WRAITH
     The hives have already left. They jettisoned your ship before they
     jumped into hyperspace?

     SHEPPARD

     (annoyed)
     Anything else happen while we were unconscious that I should know
     about?

     WRAITH
     I must return to Atlantis to help Doctor McKay complete our plan.

     SHEPPARD
     Help me wake him up, and we'll get out of here.

   [Sheppard holsters his gun and moves to Teyla.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ANCIENT REPLICATOR LAB

     MCKAY
     All right. Looking good.

     ZELENKA
     Rodney, it's being held together by a force field.

     MCKAY
     I know. I just wanted to give the cells time to establish their own
     internal cohesion. Now, we drop the field, and they should hold
     together.

   [He taps a control and the field drops.]

     MCKAY
     Not bad, not bad. Structure's intact. Bonds are holding.

   [McKay and Zelenka exchange smiles. Then a beep sounds and the cube
   collapses.]

     MCKAY
     Dammit.

     ZELENKA
     It's no use, Rodney. You've disabled too many of the cells' basic
     protocols. It was never designed to work this way.

     MCKAY
     In that case, there's only one thing we can do.

     TECHNICIAN

     (over radio)
     Doctor Zelenka?

     ZELENKA

     (into radio)
     Yes?

     TECHNICIAN

     (over radio)
     They need to see you right away in Section Seven? We're having some
     power problems in the infirmary.

     ZELENKA
     I should go. This won't take too long. Is it all right if I...

     MCKAY
     Just go. Go. You're probably holding me back anyway.

   [Zelenka leaves.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper flies back towards the Spacegate.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Everyone is now awake. Ronon continuously glowers at the Wraith.]

     SHEPPARD

     Ronon, let it go. Take it as a compliment. They were afraid of you.
     (to Teyla)
     Dial the 'gate.

   [Teyla starts to dial, and an alarm beeps.]

     TEYLA
     I'm detecting a hyperspace window forming.

     SHEPPARD
     Your guys forget something?

   EXT--SPACE

   [An Aurora-class ship jumps out of hyperspace right in front of the
   jumper. The tiny ship has to dodge to avoid a collision.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     TEYLA

     (worried)
     It's an Ancestral warship.

     SHEPPARD
     Replicators. Dial the 'gate.

     TEYLA
     How did they find us?

     RONON

     (glaring at the Wraith)
     I have an idea.

     WRAITH
     You are mistaken.

     TEYLA
     Receiving transmission.

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     LARRIN

     (over radio)
     Sheppard? That better not be you!

     SHEPPARD

     (surprised)
     Larrin?

   [Larrin appears on a HUD video link.]

     LARRIN

     (over video)
     What the hell are you doing here?

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you doing here?

     LARRIN

     (over video)
     We picked up on seven hives orbiting a single planet. Seemed like
     something big was going down, so I thought we'd stop and do a little
     intel.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, you just missed them.

     LARRIN

     (over video)
     I see that. Now tell me, what are you doing here, and better yet,
     why didn't those hives destroy your puny little ship?

     SHEPPARD
     I take great offense to that. But those are all good questions,
     so...we should talk.

     LARRIN

     (over video)
     Yes, we should. Use bay three.

   [She shuts off the transmission.]

     RONON
     Well, better her than the Replicators, right?

     SHEPPARD
     Let's see what kind of mood she's in.

   INT--BAY THREE

   [Sheppard lowers the rear compartment door. The forward compartment is
   sealed, with everyone waiting. Larrin stands waiting outside with some
   of her guards.]

     SHEPPARD
     Larrin.

   [The Wraith stands. Larrin steps back warily as she spots him, her hand
   reaching for her sidearm.]

     LARRIN
     That Wraith better be a prisoner.

     SHEPPARD
     Now, look, I know how it looks...

     LARRIN

     (to guards)
     Kill it!

   [Sheppard steps in front of the Wraith. Ronon moves out of the
   Travelers' line of fire.]

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa. Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no killing, okay? Just...just hear
     me out.

   INT--INTERROGATION CHAMBER

   [Sheppard is tied to a chair. Larrin circles him.]

     LARRIN
     So, the idea is to keep the Replicator ships from leaving orbit
     until this...McKay guy can suck them back down to the planet?

     SHEPPARD
     Couldn't have put it better myself.

     LARRIN
     And since you only have two ships...

     SHEPPARD
     We need the Wraith to help.

     LARRIN
     Huh.

     SHEPPARD
     We figure the Replicators have close to thirty ships guarding the
     surface. The Wraith bring another seven to the fight.

     LARRIN
     Still not very good odds.

     SHEPPARD
     No. No, but unless we...I don't know, meet someone with access to
     ships, it'll have to do.

     LARRIN
     One of the planets we trade with was completely wiped out a few
     weeks ago. We thought it was the Wraith, but it didn't fit. They
     weren't culled, they were leveled.

     SHEPPARD
     Replicators.

   [Larrin leans closer to Sheppard.]

     LARRIN
     Last time we worked together, I said I'd let you keep a few secrets.
     But not anymore. If we do this, we go all the way. No holding back.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Look...your ship is still a mess. We have scientists that
     have the Ancient gene. Maybe they can help you soup it up.

     LARRIN
     Well, I'll have to talk to our governing council. But even if they
     agree to move forward, it'll be up to the individual ship captains
     if they want to join us or not. And fighting alongside the Wraith
     isn't going to be popular.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we know how persuasive you can be.

     LARRIN
     I'll start making the calls.

   [She walks out of the room, leaving Sheppard there.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, great. This is all working out for the best. It's uh...except
     for the part where I'm still tied up, Larrin. Larrin?!

   [The guard closes the door behind Larrin.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [McKay waits impatiently outside a door. Zelenka rushes up.]

     MCKAY
     You and I have two very different definitions of "this won't take
     too long."

     ZELENKA
     I know. I'm really sorry. The naquadah generator in section seven is
     giving us all sorts of trouble. But it's fixed now, I'm all yours.
     What would you like to try now?

     MCKAY
     Actually, unencumbered by the continual need to explain things to
     you, I've actually made remarkable progress.

     ZELENKA
     Oh really?

     MCKAY
     Hmm. The systems the Ancients had in place were designed to create
     fully-functional humanoid Replicators, right?

     ZELENKA

     (cautiously)
     Yes...

     MCKAY
     Well, turns out that trying to create something much simpler is,
     ironically, much more difficult. In the end, I was forced to
     compromise.

   [He leads Zelenka to the Replicator lab.]

   INT--ANCIENT REPLICATOR LAB

     ZELENKA
     Wait, you're not suggesting that...

     MCKAY
     I know that it wasn't part of the plan, but it was either this, or
     nothing.

   [Zelenka stares in shock at a young, human-looking woman sitting on the
   Replicator table.]

     FRAN
     Hello.

     ZELENKA
     Oh, my...

   EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, NIGHT

   [The puddle jumper flies toward Atlantis.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard, Ronon and Teyla leave the shuttle bay. Sheppard starts
   heading down the corridor to the right.]

     SHEPPARD
     We should go check on McKay. See if he made any progress.

   [Teyla veers to left.]

     TEYLA
     I must go see Doctor Keller.

   [Sheppard and Ronon stop and turn.]

     SHEPPARD
     Why is that?

     TEYLA
     I was stunned.

     SHEPPARD
     We get stunned all the time. Shake it off.

   [He starts to leave again. Teyla stays put.]

     TEYLA
     The circumstances are...different.

   [Sheppard and Ronon pause again.]

     SHEPPARD
     How so?

   [Teyla looks around awkwardly and sees they're alone. She sighs.]

     TEYLA
     I'm carrying a child.

   [Sheppard and Ronon step closer to Teyla.]

     SHEPPARD

     (stunned)
     You're what?

     TEYLA
     I'm pregnant, John.

     SHEPPARD
     Is this a joke?

   [He turns to Ronon.]

     RONON
     Don't look at me.

     TEYLA
     It just happened.

     SHEPPARD
     I-I didn't know you were seeing anyone.

     TEYLA
     It is no one from Atlantis.

     SHEPPARD
     How...far along are you?

     TEYLA
     About three months...

     SHEPPARD
     Three--How long have you known?

     TEYLA
     Just under two.

     SHEPPARD

     (angry)
     Two. We've been...! You've let me put you out in the field when
     you've known you're three months pregnant?!

     TEYLA
     I tried to tell you.

     SHEPPARD
     You didn't try hard enough.

     TEYLA
     I am more than capable of--

     SHEPPARD
     You got stunned today! Do you have any idea what kind of effect that
     has?!

     TEYLA
     Athosian women remain very active in the community, well up to--

     SHEPPARD

     (interrupting)
     This is different! We get shot at. We get stunned! We take a chance
     every time we walk through the 'gate.

     TEYLA
     John...

     SHEPPARD
     As of this second, you are relieved from active duty.

   [Sheppard walks away. Teyla stares after him, mouth agape in shock. She
   tries to recover when she realizes Ronon is still watching her.]

     RONON
     Hey...Congratulations. Kanaan is the father?

     TEYLA
     You knew that we were...

     RONON
     I could tell. The way you talked about him.

     TEYLA
     Yes, he is the father.

     RONON
     I'm sorry.

     TEYLA
     I will find him. He is still alive. I feel it.

     RONON
     We'll find him. Together. I promise. Come on. Let's go get you
     checked out.

   [He takes her hand and walks with her towards the infirmary.]

     RONON
     You know, uh, "Ronon"...is a good name, boy or girl.

   [Teyla chuckles.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Sheppard walk down a different corridor.]

     CARTER
     So that brings the grand total to...?

     SHEPPARD
     Fourteen. Larrin said she can get three or four more ships.

     CARTER

     (pleased)
     That's great.

     SHEPPARD

     (unenthusiastic)
     Yeah.

     CARTER
     You okay?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. I'm taking Teyla off active duty.

     CARTER

     (nonplussed)
     Why?

     SHEPPARD
     She's pregnant.

     CARTER

     (after a pause)
     Uh...okay. Who's the father?

     SHEPPARD

     (pausing)
     I never asked.

     CARTER
     Wow. It really has been one helluva day. There's one more thing you
     need to see. McKay has kind of thrown us a curve ball.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh great. I was just thinking we need more of those today.

   [Carter chuckles.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard stares at a monitor showing McKay's Replicator female
   wandering around the lab. Carter and McKay are also there.]

     SHEPPARD

     (angry)
     This not what we talked about, Rodney!

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well, I'm sorry. But the block idea didn't fly. This was the
     only way.

     SHEPPARD
     Do you have any idea what kind of a security threat this is?!

     MCKAY
     It's not as bad as you think! I stripped down its programming as
     much as I possibly could without sacrificing basic viability. It can
     walk, it can talk, but it can't replicate or change its form or
     anything.

     CARTER
     Does she know why she was created?

     MCKAY
     Of course.

     CARTER
     Well then, she has a certain amount of self-awareness.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, so?

     CARTER
     So?! Honestly, I'm not sure how comfortable I am sending her to her
     death.

     MCKAY
     Death? It can't die. It's not alive. It-it's a program. I mean, it's
     "consciousness" is just a bunch of ones and zeros. I mean, you can
     call it "she" all you want, but it's still just a thing. It's-it's a
     prop. It's a...it's a really advanced radio controlled weapon. I
     mean, you don't feel sorry for your bullets, do you? Your bombs?

     CARTER
     All right. Still. It's weird.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter anyways,
     because we don't have any other choice.

     SHEPPARD

     (unhappy)
     Well, we are teaming up with the Wraith. I guess it's that kind of a
     mission.

   INT--SCIENCE LAB

   [McKay enters the lab. Zelenka is there with the Replicator and a
   security escort. She is typing on the computers.]

     ZELENKA
     We have a problem.

     MCKAY
     All right. What is it?

     FRAN
     I've been going over your calculations. I thought it would be
     prudent for the good of the mission. I hope you don't mind.

   [McKay exchanges concerned looks with Zelenka.]

     MCKAY

     (nonplussed)
     No, no, it's fine.

     FRAN
     I think you've underestimated how quickly the nanite cells will
     adapt to their changing circumstances. The mass will be able to
     manipulate its own form before it reaches critical density.

     MCKAY
     Are you sure?

     FRAN
     I'm quite positive. Once the nanites regain control, they will be
     able to halt their own collapse. At that point, they will be
     extremely dangerous.

     ZELENKA
     In other words, we're back to Godzilla.

     FRAN
     I may have a solution.

   [She goes back to typing while McKay and Zelenka exchange looks again.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

   [McKay briefs the rest of his team, Carter, Larrin, Caldwell, Ellis,
   and the Wraith.]

     MCKAY
     We overload their ZPMs, about half a dozen of them in a symmetrical
     pattern around the Replicator mass. The force of the explosion
     causes the mass to compress even further, essentially creating our
     own Replicator fusion bomb. The whole planet will be destroyed in
     the process.

     LARRIN
     You don't mess around, do you?

     ELLIS
     All this is based on information provided by a Replicator? We have
     no reason to trust it.

     SHEPPARD
     We're not trusting it; we're trusting...Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Now, this causes a slightly new wrinkle in the plan. I'll need to
     beam down to the core room.

     SHEPPARD
     Along with Ronon and a squad of marines.

     MCKAY
     From there, I should be able to hack into their systems and set the
     ZPMs to overload.

     CARTER
     In the meantime, we'll be keeping their ships occupied. The seven
     hives will space themselves around the planet equally, and our
     smaller ships will fill in the holes.

     LARRIN
     We could use you in my chair, Sheppard. We have an arsenal of
     drones, but none of my guys can fire them quite like you can.

   [Carter glances over at Sheppard who shrugs in self-deprecating manner,
   looking uncomfortable.]

     SHEPPARD
     No place I'd rather be.

     WRAITH
     The hives will be dispatching sizable waves of darts to target the
     Replicators' hyperdrive engines.

     CALDWELL
     My 302s will join you.

     WRAITH
     Very well.

     MCKAY
     Now, while I'm working in the core room, we'll beam Fran down to the
     city.

     ELLIS
     Wait a minute--Fran?

     MCKAY
     Friendly Replicator Android?

     SHEPPARD

     (warningly)
     I didn't notice we were naming things.

     MCKAY
     It noticed that, uh, Zelenka and I both had names, and, um...and she
     asked for one.

   [Carter and Sheppard exchange looks.]

     CARTER
     All right. Let's move out.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The final ships of the armada drop out of hyperspace at the rendezvous
   point. Hive ships, the two 304s, and the group of Larrin's Travelers
   fleet are all in formation.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Carter is at the starboard station. Caldwell sits at his chair.]

     CARTER
     Wow. That's quite a sight!

     CALDWELL
     I remember when the cold war ended, and we started doing joint
     missions with the Russians. I thought that was strange.

     CARTER
     I've got confirmation from the fleet. We're ready to go.

     CALDWELL
     Set coordinates for the Replicator homeworld.

   EXT--SPACE

   [All the ships enter hyperspace windows and disappear.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Apollo flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--APOLLO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

   [Fran smiles as she looks away from the window. McKay and Zelenka work
   on computers.]

     FRAN
     This is quite exciting, isn't it?

     MCKAY

     (warily)
     It's a bit...nerve-wracking. Yeah.

     FRAN
     I quite look forward to it.

   [Zelenka looks on nervously.]

     MCKAY
     You do?

     FRAN
     One always wishes to fulfill one's purpose.

     MCKAY
     Right. And you're...fine with all this?

     FRAN
     Why would I not be? It's my reason for being.

     MCKAY
     Well, I know, it's just that you're...you're gonna...cease to be.

     FRAN
     Yes...?

     MCKAY
     Well, I-I just imagine you'd...rather keep being than...uh, than
     not.

   [Zelenka backs away further.]

     FRAN
     Certainly you're not worried for me, are you, Doctor?

     MCKAY
     No. No, that would be silly.

     FRAN

     (placidly)
     Yes, it would.

   [McKay joins Zelenka.]

     MCKAY

     (low, to Zelenka)
     I should never have given it speech.

     ZELENKA

     (disturbed)
     Yeah.

     ELLIS

     (over radio)
     Doctor McKay, we're approaching our target. You need to get with
     Ronon and the marines.

     MCKAY
     On my way.

   [He starts to leave.]

     FRAN
     Doctor McKay?

     MCKAY

     (impatiently)
     Yeah?

     FRAN
     Good luck.

     MCKAY
     You too, Fran...Good luck.

   [Fran smiles.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The ships arrive above Asuras, blasting Replicator ships as they
   arrive. A full battle is engaged.]

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     ELLIS

     (to Marks)
     Target their hyperdrives with our beam weapons, and launch all 302s.
     (to port technician)
     Beam the Replicator and Doctor McKay's team down to their separate
     coordinates.

   INT--ASURAS CORRIDOR

   [Fran is beamed down into an empty corridor. She looks around to get
   her bearings, then heads down a corridor.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

   [McKay, surrounded by Ronon and marines, are beamed into the core room,
   which is otherwise empty.]

     RONON
     Fan out. Fan out.

   [The marines and Ronon separate. McKay heads to the control panel.]

     RONON
     All right, we're clear.

     MCKAY
     Okay. This won't take more than a minute.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The battle continues. Both a Replicator ship and a Wraith ship are
   damaged.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE

   [Todd the Wraith is in command of the damaged ship.]

     WRAITH TECHNICIAN
     Heavy damage in interior section.

     WRAITH
     Transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Daedalus comes between the two ships and destroys the Replicator
   ship damaging the Wraith ship.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL

     (indo radio)
     How's it coming, McKay? I don't want to be doing this all day.

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     I'm done. I've got total control over the power grid and the ZPMs,
     and Fran is...Fran's just about to activate.

   INT--ASURAS CONTROL ROOM

   [Fran enters a crowded area where many Replicators work at stations.]

     FRAN
     Hello.

   [They all look at her curiously. She closes her eyes and concentrates.
   Their curiousity turns to alarm as they disintegrate and their nanites
   swarm onto Fran.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY
     It's working, just hold those ships off a little longer.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The battle continues to rage. One of the Travelers' ships is
   destroyed.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL
     I don't know how much longer we can keep this up.

     CARTER
     We just have to keep them busy. I don't think they realize what's
     happening yet.

   EXT--ASURAS, DAY

   [One of the towers implodes, the mass of nanites overflowing out of the
   buildings and onto the planet's surface.]

   INT--BRIDGE, LARRIN'S SHIP

     TRAVELER TECHNICIAN
     One of the Replicator ships is heading towards us at maximum
     sublight. They're powering their hyperdrives.

     LARRIN

     (into intercom)
     Sheppard, do you see that?

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, LARRIN'S SHIP

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. I got it.

   [He activates the chair.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Drones fire and collide with drones from the Replicator ship. Other
   drones make it through and destroy the Replicator ship. A hive ship is
   also destroyed.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY

     (surprised)
     It's working faster than I imagined.

     RONON
     When's it going to be big enough to start pulling them down from
     orbit?

     MCKAY
     Soon. Really soon.

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Our shields can't take much more of this, sir.

     ELLIS
     Hopefully, they won't have to. Now get ready to transfer power from
     the beam weapons to the--

   [He's distracted from the view out the window.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Nanites start swarming from all the Replicator ships towards the
   surface of the planet.]

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     MARKS
     What the hell...?

     ELLIS
     Son of a bitch. He actually did it.

   EXT--ASURAS, DAY

   [The nanites swarm to the Replicator blob, which is becoming denser and
   denser.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

   [McKay hears a rumbling above them.]

     RONON
     What's happening?

     MCKAY
     The Replicator mass. It's so heavy, it's sinking into the planet's
     surface.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     McKay, according to our readings, every Replicator nanite is now
     part of the mass. Can you confirm?

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY
     Copy that, Sam. I'll set the countdown, and we should be--

   [All the power shuts down.]

     RONON
     Did you do that?

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     No...It's the mass. It's collapsed the subterranean power grid. It's
     a black out. We're not going to be able to overload the ZPMs.

   EXT--ASURAS, DAY

   [The mass of Replicator nanites undulates, striking randomly at the
   Asuras buildings as waves sway back and forth.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY

     (panicking)
     Not good. Not good. Not good!

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     Do you want me to beam down there and help you?

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     The power grid's been destroyed. There's nothing either of us can
     do!

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, LARRIN'S SHIP

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     What's the big deal? You can't overload ZPM's. Why don't we just
     send some nukes down there and get this over with?

     MCKAY

     (over radio)
     It's not as simple as that!

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Look, in order to implode a mass this large, then the explosion has
     to be timed down to the nanosecond. The force needs to be exactly
     right...I mean, you can't just fire a few nukes down here and get
     the job done.

   [The room rocks again.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Well, it's got to be better than nothing!

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The conversation continues to switch between Sheppard's location the
   Asuras core room, and the bridge.]

     CALDWELL
     I have to agree.

     CARTER
     McKay, my sensors indicate that the ground around the mass is rich
     with neutronium.

     CALDWELL
     Neutronium?

     MCKAY
     It's the base raw material of Replicator cells. It makes all the
     sense in the world why the Ancients would set up on a planet where
     it's abundant.

     CARTER
     This could be very useful. Neutronium is incredibly dense.

     SHEPPARD
     And that helps us how?

     MCKAY
     Sam, we are geniuses!

   [Carter smiles.]

     MCKAY

     (continuing)
     Okay, the mass is so superheavy, that it's sinking into the planet's
     surface. If I dial it up just a little bit, it'll attract the
     neutronium and sink all the way to the core.

     CARTER
     And the planet will exert enough pressure on it to cause an
     implosion.

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

     MCKAY

     (typing furiously into his hand-held computer)
     Just give me one more...got it!

   EXT--ASURAS, DAY

   [The Replicator mass, now huge, sinks into the planet.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

   [The room shakes violently.]

     MCKAY
     Um...we need to get out of here.

     RONON

     (to marines)
     All right, let's go. Come on!

   [Ronon leads McKay to the beam-out point. They're beamed away.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The team is beamed directly onto the bridge. McKay heads to Carter's
   station.]

     MCKAY
     As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go
     down.

     CARTER
     We should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point
     immediately. The planet's become unstable.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The ships leave the drifting Replicator ships and start heading into
   hyperspace. Below them, the planet begins to break apart. After they
   are gone, Asuras explodes, destroying the remaining Replicator ships.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Larrin's ship floats in orbit above Atlantis.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, LARRIN'S SHIP

   [Sheppard walks with Larrin.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm sorry you lost a ship.

     LARRIN
     Well, they knew what they were getting into.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but still...you gonna stick around and let my guys check this
     place out?

     LARRIN
     They already gave us a head start when they got us battle ready.
     Besides, I have some things that need to get taken care of.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, like...?

     LARRIN
     Well, nothing for you to concern your pretty little head with.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, um...now that we're allies and stuff, I should probably have
     some way of-of contacting you...you know, for professional
     reasons--in case we need help again.

     LARRIN
     I know where Atlantis is now. Don't worry. I'll stay in touch.

     MARKS

     (over radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, are you ready to beam?

     SHEPPARD
     Good seeing you again.

     LARRIN
     I bet it was.

   [Sheppard makes a face of disappointment, looks her over, then keys his
   radio.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ready to beam.

   [Sheppard beams away. Larrin watches him go with an enigmatic smile.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard is beamed into the Atlantis control room. McKay is there
   working at a station. A grid showing planet locations is displayed.]

     MCKAY
     Welcome back.

     SHEPPARD
     Good to be back. How are our good friends, the Wraith?

     MCKAY
     Well, they never showed up at the rendezvous point.

     SHEPPARD
     Hmm. You think they got caught in the explosion?

     MCKAY
     I doubt it. Or, I guess they just figured that there was nothing
     left to talk about. So as soon as the planet blew up, we were back
     to being enemies.

     SHEPPARD
     Hmm. Wraith back to being enemies. Replicators don't exist anymore.
     You're out of your dry spell.

     MCKAY
     Hey!

     SHEPPARD
     All is right with the world. What are you working on, anyway?

     MCKAY
     You'll be surprised to hear that, uh, removing a planet from the
     database is actually a lot of work.

     SHEPPARD

     (dryly)
     I thought you'd be pretty good at that by now.

     MCKAY
     You just can't resist bringing up the fact that I once accidentally
     destroyed a couple of planets, can you?

     SHEPPARD
     It was an entire solar system.

     MCKAY

     (annoyed)
     You want to do the honors?

     SHEPPARD
     Nah, go ahead.

     MCKAY
     All right. M7R-227, you were a constant pain in the ass, it's good
     to see you go.

   [McKay presses the enter key. After a few beeps, the planet disappears
   off the grid.]

     SHEPPARD
     If only it were that easy in real life.

     MCKAY
     Mmm. Area 51 is working on it. You want to get a...late dinner?

     SHEPPARD
     Absolutely.

     MCKAY
     All right. I would've loved to seen Ellis's face when my plan
     worked. He's such a tool.

     SHEPPARD
     I like him.

     MCKAY
     You do?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Good guy. Excellent judge of character.

     MCKAY
     Oh, I see. Ha ha. Heh heh. I see where you're going with that.

   [The head out for dinner.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Asteroids make up the debris field where Asuras/M7R-227 once sat. One
   Aurora-class vessel floats amongst the debris.]

   INT--BRIDGE, REPLICATOR SHIP

     REPLICATOR WOMAN
     Our intel was correct. The planet has been completely destroyed.

     REPLICATOR MAN
     Can you detect any trace Replicator cells?

     REPLICATOR WOMAN
     Negative. They've been completely wiped out.

   [Weir sits in the captain's chair.]

     WEIR
     Good. We can finally get to work without having to look over our
     shoulders. It's time to begin.

   FADE OUT
