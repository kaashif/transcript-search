   transport beam moves past, amid the whining sound of a Wraith Dart.]

     PORTA
     Is it safe?

     ASTRUM
     Yes, the chamber has been sealed.

     PORTA
     Where are the others?

     PORTA
     The Brotherhood has fallen, Astrum. We're all that remains.

     ASTRUM
     My God. If we die, then--

     PORTA
     Hurry. They're getting closer.

   [There are more Wraith Dart sounds. The men rush out.]

   [McKay is beside the spot where Astrum and Porta were taken. A female
   scientist is with him.]

     MCKAY

     (walking with her)
     Allina, I know I've said this before, but thank you so much for
     letting us in here, helping us through the material. It's been
     utterly fascinating.

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

   [Sheppard, Ford, and Teyla sit at a table full of old scrolls. McKay
   and Allina walk past, McKay carrying an armful of old books.]]

     ALLINA
     I'm happy to do it, Doctor. I'm sorry this information is so
     scattered. I'm afraid we're working on so many projects at once,
     reference materials tend to get misplaced.

     MCKAY

     Of course.
     (looking inside a book)
     Look at that.

   [Sheppard, Ford and Teyla laugh over a joke. McKay approaches them with
   an irritated expression, carrying a piece of white parchment.]

     MCKAY
     What is going on here?

     SHEPPARD
     Just having a little fun, McKay.

     MCKAY
     Can we get back to work now?

     FORD
     I just don't see how running through history books is going to find
     us our ZPM.

     MCKAY

     (holding up the parchment)
     Really? See this? This is a charcoal rubbing taken from an Ancient
     temple built about the time Weir's list was written. Notice anything
     familiar? Hmm? It's a ZPM. Look, we are close, closer than we have
     ever been before. Now, there may very well be hundreds of zero-point
     modules hidden in this galaxy, but the only one we are remotely sure
     of is here. Here.
     (somberly)
     Now, if you ever want to go home, if you ever want to protect
     Atlantis from the Wraith, we need to find this.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

     WEIR
     Do they have any idea where the ZPM could be?

     MCKAY
     According to legend, an Ancient from Atlantis came through the
     stargate and entrusted a sect of Sudarian priests with a rare
     treasure, or "Potentia," as they called it. This Lantian told them
     to keep it hidden from the Wraith at all costs. Now, the Sudarian
     people worshiped the Ancients and considered the Potentia their most
     sacred artifact. Now, predictably, they did exactly as the Ancient
     requested.

     WEIR
     The Potentia being...

     SHEPPARD
     The ZPM.

     WEIR
     So they wouldn't have used it?

     MCKAY
     From what I can tell, they only brought it out of hiding to be
     displayed on high holidays. I'd be surprised if they knew it could
     be used. And that is good news.

     WEIR
     If they didn't know how to use it chances are it's completely full.

     MCKAY
     The bad news however, is that after ten thousand years of Wraith
     culling, Sudarian society is essentially extinct. The planet's
     inhabitants are only at a Renaissance level of development, but with
     the help of some of our gear, I really think they could make some
     headway.

     WEIR
     All right. I'm sold. Major, take your team back to Dagan. See if you
     can get us a ticket home.

   INT--LARGE CHAMBER ON GENII

   INT--GENII TRAINING ROOM

   [Shirtless soldiers train. One lies on the floor. A man with a large
   scar on his right shoulder puts on a uniform coat. It is Kolya.]

     PRANOS
     Does it still pain you?

     KOLYA

     (to soldiers)
     Leave us.
     (to Pranos)
     What do you have for me?

     PRANOS
     The Atlanteans have returned to Dagan.

     KOLYA
     You're sure?

     PRANOS
     Oh, yes. Our operative just checked in. It's only been 12 hours
     since they left. They must be getting close to it.

     KOLYA
     Do we have any idea what "it" is yet?

     PRANOS
     We know a little more. Our many off-world spies have been keeping a
     close eye on the Atlantean teams from afar. But this is the first
     planet we've managed to get this close to them. They're looking for
     a Lantian-era power source.

     KOLYA
     Is Chief Cowen sending a team?

     PRANOS
     Not yet. His priorities are elsewhere. Even if he was, he would
     never send you.

     KOLYA
     The last thing the Atlanteans need is more power. Get me on that
     planet, with or without Cowen's blessing.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Chuck the Technician works on a console with Zelenka. Chuck drinks
   from a metal cup.]

     TECHNICIAN
     I don't know what happened. It just stopped working. I got some of
     the functionality back. It still isn't doing everything it used to.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, well, maybe if people stop insisting on having food and liquid
     in such close proximity to the ten-thousand-year-old equipment...

     TECHNICIAN
     Hey, we're very careful. We're not the problem here.

     ZELENKA
     Ah. Yes. Uh-huh.

   [Zelenka leaves a laptop running and steps away. After a moment, the
   large Ancient screen becomes scrambled.]

     ZELENKA
     What did you touch?

     TECHNICIAN
     Nothing. I didn't touch anything.

     ZELENKA

     Curses in Czech. (looking at laptop)
     Then why is it... What is this?

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Zelenka and Weir walk.]

     WEIR
     I didn't know we had deep space sensors.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, well, no one did. From what I can tell, they've been running
     silently in the background along with our other primary systems.

     WEIR
     In the background?

     ZELENKA
     Yes.

     WEIR
     So why the sudden leap to the foreground?

     ZELENKA
     Excellent question.

     WEIR
     We don't have an answer for that yet, do we?

     ZELENKA
     Not as of yet, no.

     WEIR
     Okay, well, keep me in the loop.

     ZELENKA

     (chuckling)
     You are the loop.

   [Zelenka continues beside Weir, looking uncomfortable.]

     WEIR
     Isn't that a nice thing to say. You're more than welcome to continue
     walking with me, but if there's something that you need to do...

     ZELENKA
     Yes. Yes.

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

   [Allina briefs the team.]

     ALLINA
     They called themselves "The Quindosim," a brotherhood of fifteen
     monks whose sole occupation was to keep the Potentia, or ZPM, safe.

     MCKAY
     Fascinating.

     SHEPPARD
     Yes. Fascinating.

     MCKAY
     Please, go on.

     SHEPPARD
     The Brotherhood of the fifteen consisted of a "Master Handler," five
     "Protectors," and nine "Stone Carriers." Their greatest fear was
     that the entire Brotherhood might one day be culled by the Wraith,
     which would result in the ZPM going missing forever.

     TEYLA
     Missing, yes, but it would not fall into enemy hands.

     ALLINA
     They were entrusted with the ZPM. Their hope was that one day the
     Lanteans would return to reclaim it and reward the Sudarian people
     for completing their task.

     MCKAY
     So they left hints, clues, should the Brotherhood be destroyed.

     ALLINA
     That's right. The priests created nine stone markers that, when
     united, are supposed to reveal the final resting place of the
     Quindosim's protected treasure. So far, we've only found three. The
     etching on the rocks involved many lines and dots. We think it's a
     map.

     MCKAY
     Mm. Amazing.

     SHEPPARD
     It is, actually. This looks like an Ancient numbering system.

     ALLINA
     That's what we thought. From what we can tell, they're numbers
     three, six, and seven.

     MCKAY

     (smiling kindly)
     Excellent work. I mean, seriously, I'm very impressed here.

     ALLINA
     That's very kind of you, Doctor.

   [Sheppard gives McKay a look.]

     MCKAY
     Where did you find them?

     ALLINA
     This building used to be their monastery, actually. We pieced
     together some of the information we found here, and tracked down the
     number six and seven stones. We found the number three stone on an
     unrelated dig just last week.

     SHEPPARD
     So, if we find the stones, we find the map?

     ALLINA
     Yes, exactly.

     MCKAY
     Here. You see this?

   [He gives a stone tile to Ford.]

     FORD
     Part of the design?

     MCKAY
     I don't think anything on these stones is there just for aesthetics.
     Here. Yeah. Each of the stones has a different part of the grid
     embossed.

     ALLINA
     Signifying where its correct placing should be in the final
     configurations.

     MCKAY
     Exactly.

     FORD
     So what?

     MCKAY

     "So what?"
     (to Allina)
     Do you have a map?

   [Later, Allina is showing them a paper map of the excavations.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, where did you find them?

     ALLINA
     We found the seven stone here... The six stone here... And, most
     recently, we stumbled on the number three stone here.

     MCKAY
     You have no idea how lucky a find that was.

   [McKay starts drawing crossing straight lines on the map.]

     ALLINA
     I see it.

     TEYLA
     Doctor, I am not sure I--

     MCKAY
     They're buried in a grid. Look, we couldn't have done this without
     the number three stone. That, along with the number seven stone
     gives us two diagonally opposed corners. From that, you can
     extrapolate exactly how big the grid is, and therefore where each of
     the other stones should be buried.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, split up, two teams. Let's start digging.

   EXT--WOODS OF DAGAN, DAY

   [Kolya, Pranos, and Genii spy Tathal walk.]

     PRANOS
     Do you think they'll find it?

     TATHAL
     Many people from many worlds have come to find the lost treasure of
     the Quindosim.

     PRANOS
     Do you think they will find it?

     KOLYA
     I do not know. We'll wait for them to find the treasure, then take
     it by force. Your men are not to act until I give word. Understood?

     TATHAL
     Absolutely.

   EXT--WOODS OF DAGAN, DAY

   [Elsewhere, McKay leads Allina and Sanir on the search.]

     MCKAY
     Which would make us, uh... Right, I think.

     ALLINA
     Can you believe the progress we've made, Sanir? How many years have
     we been searching for these stones?

   [Sanir suddenly stops.]

     ALLINA
     What's wrong?

     SANIR
     We should not be helping them, Allina.

     ALLINA
     They are helping us as much as we are helping them.

     SANIR
     They will take the Potentia if they find it. You must see that.

     ALLINA
     They have come to us from the great city of Atlantis. It is for them
     that the Brotherhood of the fifteen have kept the treasure hidden.

     SANIR
     I do not trust them, Allina.

     ALLINA
     If you would rather head back to your village than help us, I will
     not stop you.

   [They continue on with McKay.]

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [McKay the Dagan women, and Teyla, Ford and Sheppard dig in marked
   excavation pits in different locations.]

   [Later, Sheppard finds a box.]

     SHEPPARD
     Check this out.

   [He opens the box and finds a stone tile. Elsewhere, Teyla finds one as
   well, as does McKay at his location.]

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE, DAGAN

   [Sanir finds the box.]

     SANIR
     Allina.

   [McKay pulls a tile from the box.]

     MCKAY
     This is going to work.

     ALLINA
     I think it just might.

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

   [The teams have re-joined. McKay stands beside a map posted on the
   wall.]

     ALLINA
     It's a layout... of the Sudarian villages. The walls of this
     monastery have protected it for ten thousand years.

     MCKAY
     It's beautiful.

     ALLINA

     (smiling flirtatiously)
     It is... And yet, my eye is drawn elsewhere.

     MCKAY

     (looking around, bemused)
     Hmm? How so?

     ALLINA
     I'd like to restore it one day, but I'm afraid of damaging it.
     Perhaps you could help me, Doctor.

     MCKAY
     Really, you need to start calling me Rodney.

     ALLINA
     Very well.

   [They sit down on a bench. McKay yawns.]

     ALLINA
     I don't bore you, do I?

     MCKAY
     No. No, no. It's not you. I just don't think I've ever been so
     tired.

     ALLINA
     But you're a scientist. Are you not used to this by now?

     MCKAY
     Mm, yeah, but my kind of science is the good kind of science, the
     kind you can do sitting in a chair or even laying on a couch.

     ALLINA
     What was it like? Growing up in the city of the Ancestors, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry?

     ALLINA
     Atlantis.

     MCKAY
     Oh, no, no, no, no, we didn't, uh... We come from a planet called
     Earth, in an altogether different galaxy. We only just recently made
     Atlantis our home.

     ALLINA
     How recently?

     MCKAY
     Oh, just a matter of months, really.

     ALLINA
     You're tired.

     MCKAY
     Mm.

     ALLINA
     Do not let me keep you from sleep.

     MCKAY
     If you insist. I'll, um...yeah. Okay.

   [He walks away. Allina sighs.]

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

   [McKay enters the area where the rest of his team is eating at the main
   table.]

     MCKAY
     I'm heading to bed.

     SHEPPARD
     Which bed might that be?

     MCKAY
     What?

     FORD
     I think Allina might have a little crush on you, Doc.

     MCKAY
     Oh, she does?

     TEYLA
     It is very clear to us all.

     MCKAY

     (surprised)
     It is?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, everyone but you, apparently.

     MCKAY
     Should I have, um... Are you sure about this?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I'm very sure.

     MCKAY
     What should I do?

     SHEPPARD
     You don't know what to do?

     MCKAY
     I know what to do, eventually. I mean, what should I do now? Should
     I say something, something tonight?

     SHEPPARD
     Tell you what, Valentino--wait till tomorrow. You'll be more on your
     game after you get some rest.

     MCKAY

     Oh. Right. Right. Good answer.
     (more loudly, so Allina can hear)
     Good night.

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [McKay and Allina study the stone tiles they have found while the rest
   of the team digs.]

     ALLINA
     It doesn't look much like a map. I guess I was wrong.

     MCKAY
     Mm, possibly, although, um, well, you know, just because you
     originally thought it was a map doesn't make your initial assumption
     bad or incorrect. Well, incorrect, yes, but it was a good guess.

     ALLINA
     I'm sorry?

     MCKAY

     (tentatively)
     You're...very, very smart, and, uh...and attractive and whatnot,
     and, um...Uh...you've got a lot of things going for you even when
     things don't--

   [Sheppard has walked up behind them to drink some water.]

     ALLINA
     Is everything all right?

     MCKAY
     Everything's great. Everything's really... Why wouldn't it be?

     SHEPPARD
     You're sure we're in the right place? We've almost doubled the size
     of the dig site, and we haven't found anything yet.

     MCKAY
     It's got to be the right place. The other eight stones were almost
     exactly where we thought they would be. Why would this be any
     different?

     FORD
     Major!

     SHEPPARD
     Tell me you found the stone.

     FORD
     Not quite, sir, but I think McKay should take a look at this.

   [At Ford's position, they uncover a large cover stone with a symbol on
   it.]

     ALLINA
     It carries the mark of the Brotherhood.

     SHEPPARD
     The writing's in Ancient. Can you read it?

     MCKAY
     It's a warning. It says, "Only the Brotherhood of the Fifteen should
     enter the forbidden chamber--"

     ALLINA
     "Of the Quindosim."

     TEYLA
     What chamber?

   [They set up a tripod with a block and tackle, which the use to move
   aside the cover stone. Ford activates some chemical lights and tosses
   them into the shaft below. It is not very deep.]

     MCKAY
     So, who wants to go first? Seems sort of like a Sheppard thing?

   [Later, McKay and Ford lower Teyla into the shaft. Sheppard has already
   gone. From a ridge nearby, Kolya watches through a spyglass, flanked by
   other Genii.]

     KOLYA
     We couldn't have planned it any better.

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

   [McKay is lowered into the chamber.]

     MCKAY
     Oh. Easy, Ford! God.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, he's down.

     FORD

     (from the opening above)
     All right. I'll stay up here, keep an eye on the descender.

     SHEPPARD
     Stay sharp. I'll let you know if anything interesting happens.

   [Allina has found a platform with spots for the nine tiles.]

     ALLINA
     Do you see this? This is the whole pattern.

     MCKAY
     So the ninth stone must integrate into this raised center piece.

   [McKay notices hand-shaped indentations on either side of the platform.
   He puts one hand in one.]

     MCKAY
     May I?

   [He puts his other hand on the other side, but nothing happens.]

     TEYLA
     I believe we can rule out a map.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Any ideas?

     MCKAY
     I'm getting there.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, EVENING

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

     WEIR

     (to a team leader)
     Yes, get your team together and head off to section seven.

     ZELENKA
     Dr. Weir, Dr. Weir, I was finally able to interface our computers
     with the Atlantean long-range sensors.

     WEIR
     Excellent.

     ZELENKA
     There's an unidentified craft about the size of a Wraith Dart
     heading for the city.

     WEIR
     What?

     ZELENKA
     Yes.

   [They rush inside.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     ZELENKA
     I'm sorry. The sensors picked it up days ago, but it's taken me
     until now to finally decipher what they've been trying to tell us.

     WEIR
     A Dart. How is that possible?

     ZELENKA
     Well, perhaps it was modified to get here as quickly as possible.

     WEIR
     The hive ships are light years away still.

     ZELENKA

     (at a console)
     Well, it could have used a neighboring Stargate and been flying
     towards us at maximum speed ever since Wraith discovered that we
     were here. At its current velocity...it will be here in 27 minutes.

     WEIR
     We need to get jumpers in the air.

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [Ford stands watch above the shaft. He is hit in the neck by a dart. He
   pulls it out, but falls unconscious.]

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

   [McKay studies the tiles.]

     SHEPPARD
     What? What-what don't you believe?

     MCKAY
     It's a gate address, a six-symbol gate address.

     TEYLA
     Gate symbols?

     ALLINA
     I see them now. Yes.

     TEYLA
     Do you recognize the address?

     MCKAY
     No.

     ALLINA
     I'm not familiar with this one, either.

     SHEPPARD
     So the ninth stone is on another planet.

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [Kolya approaches the shaft area.]

     KOLYA
     Is he dead?

     TATHAL
     No, just unconscious. He will be like that for hours.

     KOLYA
     Excellent. We'll wait for them to--

   [Ford sits up, trips one man, and shoots Tathal.]

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

   [McKay and the others hear the shots.]

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [Kolya and his men point guns at Ford. Ford has one man on the ground.]

     KOLYA
     Put the weapon down, Lieutenant Ford.

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

   [Sheppard and the others walk to the bottom of the shaft and looks up.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ford?

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [The man being held by Ford elbows Ford in the face, knocking him
   unconscious.]

     KOLYA
     Major Sheppard. I'm afraid the Lieutenant has had to step away for a
     moment.

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

     MCKAY
     Who's that?

     SHEPPARD
     It can't be.

     TEYLA
     It sounds like...

     SHEPPARD
     Kolya?

   [Kolya appears at the opening above. He and Sheppard point guns at each
   other.]

     KOLYA
     Surprised?

     SHEPPARD
     You're alive.

     KOLYA
     As far as I can tell. Did you actually think a single bullet to the
     shoulder would kill me? I always thought you were smarter than that.

     SHEPPARD
     What'd you do to Ford?

     KOLYA
     He's fine.

     SHEPPARD
     Then what do you want?

     KOLYA
     The same as you, Major--the lost treasure of the Quindosim.

     SHEPPARD
     What possible use could that be to you?

     KOLYA
     The Daganians have informed us that this ZPM, whatever it may be, is
     an object of great power. And great power is of use to all people,
     especially the Genii.

     ALLINA
     Sanir.

     SANIR
     They offered us a great reward, Allina. They agreed to let us keep
     the treasure if we just--

   [Allina slaps Sanir.]

     SHEPPARD
     They're no use to you, Kolya. ZPMs only work on Atlantis.

     KOLYA
     Perhaps...but I prefer hearing that from a Genii scientist.

     TEYLA
     We do not have it yet. We have not found the ninth stone.

     KOLYA
     We have an unbelievably large tactical advantage over you. Now, if
     you would rather I just cover the mouth of the chamber up and forget
     about the whole thing, I'm more than willing to consider it.

     MCKAY
     She's right. We're closer, but we're not there yet. Look, the ninth
     stone is hidden on another planet. All we have is the gate address.

     KOLYA
     Dr. McKay... So wonderful to hear your grating voice again. How's
     the arm?

     MCKAY
     Do you want to keep trading barbs or do you want to find the ZPM?
     Look, lift me out of here, I'll help you find it, but then you let
     my team go.

     SHEPPARD
     Shut up, McKay.

     MCKAY
     You got a better idea?

     SHEPPARD
     No.

     MCKAY
     Do we have a deal or not?

     KOLYA
     You and two Daganians will be raised out...along with everyone's
     weapons and radios. The rest of you will remain here. If Dr. McKay
     finds the ZPM, the others will be let go. I give you my word.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we have his word.

     MCKAY

     I don't see that we have much choice.
     (calling up)
     I'm coming up.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR
     We've got the general population confined to their quarters. Let's
     hope they're out of harm's way.

     ZELENKA
     Any word from Sheppard yet?

     WEIR
     No, I've not been able to reach him. His entire team is off radio.

     ZELENKA
     It's still closing in very fast. Who are we going to get to fly the
     third jumper?

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Bates and Beckett are in a Jumper in the bay, Beckett in the pilot's
   seat.]

     BECKETT
     I can barely make it to the mainland and back without crashing. For
     the last time I'm a doctor, not a bloody fighter pilot.

     BATES
     A Wraith Dart's going to be all over this city inside of ten
     minutes, and our only real fighter pilot is off-world. I, for one,
     would like to mount the best defense we can.

     BECKETT

     (taking the controls)
     Brilliant.

   INT--ATLANTIS JUMPER BAY

   [The Puddle Jumper lifts off and flies out into the atmosphere.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     TECHNICIAN
     Jumper Two is away. All three are out.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Good luck, Carson.

     BECKETT

     (over radio)
     Thanks. I'll need it.

   EXT--AT DHD OF DAGAN, DAY

   [McKay dials an address on the DHD. The Stargate doesn't activate.]

     MCKAY
     It's not working.

     KOLYA
     Try it again.

     MCKAY
     Look, I've tried it twice, backwards and forwards.

     KOLYA
     We've played this game before, McKay. Try some other combinations of
     the same symbols.

     MCKAY
     You joking? Do you have any idea how long that would take?

     PRANOS
     He's right. There are 720 possible gate address.

     MCKAY
     It's a waste of time.

     KOLYA
     You said the address was the location of the ninth stone.

     MCKAY
     Look, it has to be, but the puzzle is ten thousand years old. Maybe
     the gate doesn't exist anymore. Look, back in the Milky Way, some
     cultures actually bury their gates to render them useless.

     PRANOS
     What about something else? What if these aren't Stargate symbols?

   [McKay holds up a rubbing of the tiles.]

     MCKAY
     Look at them. What else would they be, huh?

     ALLINA
     Actually, these symbols may not be gate-related.

     MCKAY
     Really? What are you thinking?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     ZELENKA

     (into radio)
     Gentlemen, you should have visual in thirty seconds.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [Three Jumpers fly up and away from the city.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BATES
     You ready?

     BECKETT
     No, I'm not ready.

     BATES
     You're going to do fine.

     BECKETT
     Is fine going to be enough?

     ZELENKA

     (over radio)
     Coming right at you.

     BECKETT
     Do you see it yet?

     BATES
     Not yet. I can't see it anywhere.

   EXT--SKY ABOVE ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The Dart fires on the first Jumper, blowing it up. The other two pass
   it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BATES

     (shocked)
     Atlantis...Markham and Smith have been taken out.

     BECKETT
     It's headed for the city.

   EXT--SKY ABOVE ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The two Jumpers turn back toward the city.]

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

   [Allina stands before the large map again.]

     ALLINA
     This monastery is where the fifteen priests of the Brotherhood used
     to live. The mural here is a map, a layout of Sudaria as it was in
     their time. I should have thought of this before. See, the Sudarians
     worshiped the Lantean Ancestors. The Stargate was considered a
     sacred portal and its symbols religious icons. All 36 gate symbols
     are incorporated.

     MCKAY
     So, connect the symbols on the stones...

     PRANOS
     And you should be able to triangulate where the center stone is
     buried.

     MCKAY
     You're a genius.

     ALLINA
     Thank you, Rodney.

     KOLYA
     Yes okay, we're all very impressed, but let's get on with it.

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

   [Marines watch as the Dart speeds past, followed by the Jumpers.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BATES
     Shoot it down!

   EXT--ATLANTIS

   [The Dart and Jumpers fly through the city.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BECKETT
     It's right in the middle of the city. I don't have a clean shot.

   EXT--ATLANTIS

   [The Dart activates a field beneath it.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR
     What's it doing?

     ZELENKA
     It's scanning us.

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

   [McKay uses surveyor's lasers to create lines on the map corresponding
   to Gate symbols around the map. The lines form a triangle in the
   center.]

     MCKAY
     Huh.

     ALLINA
     I was hoping it would narrow the area down a little more.

     MCKAY
     Well, it was worth a shot.

     KOLYA
     How big an area does that represent on the map?

     ALLINA
     Several square miles.

     MCKAY
     Hold on a second. It's part of their symbol.

   [He sets up a second surveyor's tripod.]

     ALLINA
     The mark of the Fifteen. Yes.

     KOLYA
     What?

     MCKAY
     It's a fifteen-line symbol. Fifteen lines.

     ALLINA
     Nine lines on the outside.

     MCKAY
     Representing the Stone Carriers.

     ALLINA
     Six on the inside.

     MCKAY
     Representing the five Protectors and the Master Handler.

   [The lines intersect at a single point.]

     KOLYA
     Do you know where that is?

     ALLINA
     Yes. I can take you there.

     MCKAY
     Hold on a second.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The Dart flies low over the city, scanning it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [They pursue the Dart.]

     BECKETT
     Hold tight. One more second.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The Dart explodes, and the two Jumpers fly through the debris.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     BATES
     Yes!

     BECKETT
     We didn't do that. At least, I don't think we did.

     BATES

     Well, whatever happened, it's dead.
     (into radio)
     Atlantis...we have a kill.

   INT--CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Good news, Jumper Two. Now head on home.

   INT--LIBRARY ON DAGAN

     MCKAY

     Someone, give me a knife.
     (at their reluctance)
     You all have guns. Someone, give me a knife.

     KOLYA
     All right.

   [They give him a knife. He starts to touch the laser intersection point
   on the map.]

     ALLINA
     Rodney!

     MCKAY
     It's not a map to where the center stone is. It is where the center
     stone is. Look.

   [He pulls away a piece of the map, revealing the final tile hidden
   edge-wise behind it.]

     MCKAY
     We have all the pieces.

     KOLYA
     Congratulations, Dr. McKay. You may live yet.

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

   [Sheppard searches the chamber.]

     SHEPPARD
     This is pointless. No trap doors or hidden passageways.

     TEYLA
     There may be more than one way in here, Major.

     SHEPPARD
     If you're trying to hide a chamber, you don't put a bunch of
     entrances and exits all over the damn place.

     FORD
     You'd rather just sit here and wait for them to come back?

     SHEPPARD
     What have you got that we can use? I've got a couple MREs, some
     ammo, and some med supplies.

   [Teyla pulls a knife from the sheath on her leg.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's a start.

     FORD
     I've got a couple of flash-bangs. I think that's about it, though.

     TEYLA
     Flash-bangs?

     FORD
     Work kind of like grenades. Pull the pin, depress the trigger, once
     you let the spoon pop, you've got about 1.5 seconds before the room
     is filled with 2.4 million candlepower and a bang that's rated at
     175 decibels.

     SHEPPARD
     It'll stun anyone with their eyes and ears open for about ten
     seconds.

   [Sheppard looks around and starts to clear some dirt near a brick
   wall.]

     FORD
     What are you doing? You going to dig us out of here?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, something like that. Come over and give me a hand.

   EXT--EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY

   [Genii guard the shaft entrance. McKay and the others approach, McKay
   talking to Kolya.]

     MCKAY
     Hey, you want Sora back? Is that what this is about?

     KOLYA
     Sora knew what she was doing, more so than most of the men. Besides,
     the Genii do not make deals with terrorists.

     MCKAY
     Terrorists? You attacked us!

     KOLYA
     After you ambushed us on our own world.

     MCKAY
     This is crazy. We're both just trying to protect our people.

     KOLYA
     That's correct, but if making your people the target buys my people
     more time, it will have been worth it.

     MCKAY
     Listen--

     KOLYA
     I don't want to discuss it any further, Doctor. Find the ZPM, and
     you can all return to Atlantis. Fail, and the deal's off.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR
     So what happened out there?

     BATES
     As soon as we had a clean shot, it self-destructed.

     WEIR
     Why?

     BATES
     Ma'am, I have no idea. I don't think it came here to fight. It
     didn't seem that interested in the Jumpers, except for when we were
     blocking its way to the city.

     ZELENKA
     Darts are not long-range fighters. The fact it came so far, alone...
     It was a scout.

     WEIR
     But why would it self-destruct? Scouts are meant to relay
     information.

     ZELENKA
     But it did relay information.

   [He brings his laptop to the large display.]

     ZELENKA
     Look. Just before it exploded, the Dart was transmitting data.

     WEIR
     I don't suppose you could--

     ZELENKA
     Not any time soon, at least.

     BATES
     Can we determine where it was sending it?

     ZELENKA
     Well, I could direct the long-range sensors to that area, see what
     shows up. Give me a couple of hours.

   INT--UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN

   [Sheppard, Teyla, and Ford stand with their hands behind their heads,
   near the brick wall Sheppard had been digging beside. The others are at
   the pedestal.]

     MCKAY
     I just assumed that we place the stones on the pedestal, have
     someone put their hands on the palm prints, and hopefully, we get
     the ZPM. The only question is, what order do we put the stones in?

     PRANOS
     I think it's pretty straightforward.

     MCKAY
     Well, nothing's been straightforward yet. What makes you think this
     would be?

     PRANOS
     The last one is the only one with grooves that match the center
     position.

     MCKAY
     So?

     PRANOS
     So it fits snugly into place. Complete the pattern, get the ZPM. Why
     would they continue to play games at this point?

     MCKAY
     I really don't think you understand how these people thought.

     KOLYA
     McKay. Stop stalling.

     MCKAY
     I'm not stalling. I just think we need to consider the fact--

     KOLYA
     Pranos, arrange the stones and retrieve the ZPM, please.

   [Pranos puts the final tile in the middle of the nine, then places his
   hands on the imprints. Two metal bracelets spring from the platform
   over his wrists, then retract.]

     PRANOS
     Aah!

     KOLYA
     McKay.

     MCKAY
     What do you want me to do?

   [Pranos looks at his palms. There are triangular cuts on each one.]

     PRANOS
     What's this?

   [Pranos falls to the ground. Kolya checks him.]

     KOLYA
     He's dead. You knew this would happen.

     MCKAY
     Yes. Yes, I did. In fact, I was in the middle of telling you as much
     when you ordered him to activate the pedestal. Look, you killed him,
     not me.

     KOLYA
     What's the correct order of the stones?

     MCKAY
     I'm not sure yet.

     KOLYA

     Well, you'll have four chances to get it right.
     (to Sheppard)
     You go first.

   [Later, Sheppard is arranging the tiles on the pedestal.]

     SHEPPARD
     Any time you want to start...

     MCKAY
     I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. We tried one to nine.

     MCKAY
     Thank you, yes.

     SHEPPARD
     How about nine to one?

     MCKAY
     Possibly. Look, Pranos was right. The center stone's the only one
     that locks into place. All the others must move around it. I'm just
     trying to think of a combination that make sense with five in the
     middle.

     SHEPPARD
     15. It's got to have something to do with fifteen...or nine, or
     five--

     MCKAY
     Shut up. Please? I'm trying to think.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not going to shut up, Rodney. My life's at stake.

     MCKAY
     Exactly, so simmer down, and let me save it!

     SHEPPARD
     Ever heard the term two heads are better than one?

     MCKAY
     It's a common misconception.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Kolya)
     Give me the gun. I'll shoot him myself.

     KOLYA
     This is taking too long. Choose and go.

     MCKAY
     What, you got somewhere you've got to be?

     KOLYA
     Choose and go.

     MCKAY
     I got nothing.

     SHEPPARD
     Thanks for the pep talk.

     MCKAY
     Nine to one. It's all I can think of.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. Step back.

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not dead yet.

     MCKAY
     Yeah. Sorry.

     KOLYA
     Major. Now.

   [Sheppard studies the tiles, then gets a look of realization.]

     SHEPPARD
     I got it!

     MCKAY
     What?

     SHEPPARD
     The Brotherhood of 15.

     MCKAY
     What about it?

     SHEPPARD
     The numbers one to nine can be put in a three-by-three grid so they
     add up to 15 in every direction.

     MCKAY
     Oh, you're right. How'd you know that?

     SHEPPARD
     It was on a Mensa test.

     MCKAY
     You're a member of Mensa?

     SHEPPARD
     No, but I took the test.

     MCKAY
     When?

     SHEPPARD
     You want to talk about this now, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Right. Right. Okay.

     SHEPPARD
     Two, nine, four...

   [They arrange the tiles to achieve the sums.]

     MCKAY
     Seven, five, three... Six, one, eight. That's it. That's got to be
     it.

     KOLYA
     Good luck.

   [McKay steps away. Sheppard places his hands in the indentations. From
   the large stone tablet on the wall in front of them, a ZPM slides out.
   Sheppard takes a deep breath of relief. Kolya goes to the ZPM. Sheppard
   looks at Teyla and Ford and nods. Ford releases the flash-bang trigger
   at his foot. He and Teyla run down the corridor. Sheppard covers his
   ears and ducks his head. Kolya is unprepared as the flash-bang goes
   off. Teyla knifes a Genii; Sheppard fights Kolya. Teyla stabs another
   Genii. Ford takes out a soldier as well, and Sheppard gets his weaponed
   aimed at Kolya. McKay stumbles around, unable to see.]

     MCKAY
     What the hell just happened?

     SHEPPARD
     Are you okay?

     ALLINA
     Yes. Thank you.

     SHEPPARD
     Sorry, Rodney. I had no way of telling you what was coming.

     MCKAY
     What, my eyes? I need my eyes for seeing!

     SHEPPARD
     Get the ZPM, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     It's a small miracle I can still make out shapes, that's all I'm
     saying.

   [He pulls the ZPM from the wall while Kolya stare at him.]

     KOLYA
     Don't look at me.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. We're getting out of here. We're going to send a villager
     to pick you up in about an hour.

     KOLYA
     The smart thing would be to kill me now.

   [Sheppard walks over and points a pistol at Kolya.]

     SHEPPARD
     You're right. I tell you what-- I'm going to want points for this in
     the future... But if you ever do this again I will kill you. Deal?

   [Ford starts to rise out of the shaft on the rope, Teyla holding the
   other side of it.]

     SHEPPARD
     Are we good?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, as far as I can see.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's move out.

     MCKAY
     I can't believe you never mentioned the Mensa thing.

     SHEPPARD
     I took the test. I never joined.

     MCKAY
     But you passed.

     SHEPPARD
     Yes.

     MCKAY
     Well, do you know we have a chapter on Atlantis? You could become an
     honorary--

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney. Rodney, up the rope.

   EXT--DAGAN WOODS, DAY

   [Sheppard's team and Allina walk.]

     FORD
     I thought we'd never find one of those things.

     SHEPPARD
     You know, I'm going to sleep pretty soundly tonight.

     MCKAY
     Not me. I'm going to be up all night getting every system I can back
     on-line. Allina, I don't think we'll ever be able to properly repay
     you for this.

     ALLINA
     You won't have to.

   [Armed men and women arise all around them, and others come running up
   on the path. They all have guns. They converge on Sheppard's team.]

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry?

     SHEPPARD
     All right, all right. Easy. Easy.

     MCKAY
     Allina...you involved the Genii?

     ALLINA
     This has nothing to do with the Genii. I'm a member of the New
     Brotherhood.

     MCKAY
     Then what is this about?

     ALLINA
     Ten generations ago after a severe culling, the Brotherhood was
     destroyed. Many of us found their writings and decided to try and
     complete the task handed down to us by the Ancestors. I am the new
     Master Handler. We thank you for helping us find the Potentia, but
     it must go into hiding again.

     SHEPPARD
     We come from the city of the Ancestors. That ZPM was intended for
     us.

     ALLINA
     No. You live in Atlantis, but you are not the Ancestors.

     SHEPPARD

     (to McKay)
     What'd you tell her?

     MCKAY
     Atlantis might fall if we don't take this ZPM back. Then it would
     serve no purpose. Do you really think the Ancestors would have
     wanted that?

     ALLINA
     None of us can know their plan.

     SHEPPARD
     They don't have a plan. Do you think getting attacked by the Wraith
     and chased out of the galaxy is something they planned for?

     MCKAY
     Allina, you're far too smart to think--

     ALLINA
     The Potentia will be put into hiding on another world. When the
     Ancestors return our people will be greatly rewarded.

   [She takes the ZPM from McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Allina, you can't believe that. Look, come back with us. Let me
     prove it to you.

     ALLINA
     This is how it must be. Now it is time for you to leave.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard's team has returned.]

     WEIR
     Did you try to explain--

     MCKAY
     I tried. Believe me, we tried.

     WEIR
     We could have used it.

     SHEPPARD
     Of course we could have.

     WEIR
     No, you don't understand. While you were off-world, a Wraith Dart
     flew over our city.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm sorry?

     WEIR
     We lost a Jumper, along with Markham and Smith.

     SHEPPARD

     (shocked)
     We what?

     WEIR
     And it scanned us.

     SHEPPARD
     We just lost two of my men and a Jumper, and this is the first time
     I'm hearing about it?

     WEIR
     I tried to reach you, but you've been out of radio contact for over
     twelve hours. Now, the Dart sent a transmission deep into space, and
     then it self-destructed before we could get to it.

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, we scanned the area with our deep space sensors and, uh...

     MCKAY
     We have deep space sensors?

     ZELENKA
     Yeah. It's a long story.

     WEIR
     And we found something else...rather unsettling.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm already unsettled. Show me.

   [Zelenka activates the large screen, showing three large ships.]

     MCKAY
     What are those?

     ZELENKA
     Wraith hive ships. Three of them. The system analysis just got
     back--

     SHEPPARD
     Right. Where are they headed?

     WEIR
     If they maintain direction and speed, they'll be over our planet
     within two weeks.

   FADE OUT
