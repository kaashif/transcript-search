   TEASER

   EXT--PLANET, NIGHT

   [Sheppard's team walks into a village. There are some lanterns on, but
   it seems deserted.]

     SHEPPARD
     Another great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.

     TEYLA
     Where is everyone?

     RONON
     There's smoke from the chimneys. They're inside.

     MCKAY
     Can't say I blame them. There's nothing I hate more than a damp
     cold.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's check this out.

   [He leads them to a building.]

   INT--TAVERN

   [The team enters the crowded tavern. Everyone turns to stare at them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Howdy, folks.

     BARKEEP
     Who are you?

     SHEPPARD
     Sheppard. This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay.

     BARKEEP
     You from Ratira?

     SHEPPARD
     No.

     BARKEEP
     From over the mountains, then?

     SHEPPARD
     A little further.

     BARKEEP
     Huh. Then you've come a long way. You'll be in need of food and
     drink. Sit.

   [They come in and sit at a table.]

     MCKAY
     I take it you don't get many strangers around here.

     BARKEEP
     No. Especially not those that travel near dark.

     SHEPPARD
     Why is that?

     BARKEEP
     You really don't know?

     GORAN

     Callum.
     (to Sheppard)
     What's your business here?

     SHEPPARD
     No business, really. We're just travelers.

     GORAN
     Then you best keep traveling.

     MCKAY
     Yeah.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, then.

   [The team starts to stand up.]

     BARKEEP
     Wait. Goran, you can't send them out there.

     GORAN
     They look like they can take care of themselves. It may not even
     start tonight.

     BARKEEP
     It's been three months. How much longer do you think it'll wait?

     MCKAY
     Hi. What are you talking about?

     GORAN
     The Daimos.

     SHEPPARD
     Never heard of it.

     GORAN
     It lives in the forest. It'll be feeding soon.

     MCKAY
     And it is, what, some kind of an animal, or...

     GORAN
     It's a creature. It has the appearance of a man, but it can suck the
     very life from your bones. Leaves only a dead withered husk behind.

   [As he speaks, the team realizes what he is talking about.]

     SHEPPARD
     Sounds familiar.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--TAVERN

   [Goran now sits with the team; the barkeep serves them all drinks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, we know you're not used to dealing with strangers, but we may
     be able to help you with this little problem you're having. We're
     used to dealing with this kind of thing.

     TEYLA
     We call them the Wraith.

     GORAN
     These are the creatures from the old stories? From the time of the
     cullings?

     MCKAY
     So you have heard of them.

     GORAN
     Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete. They tell of the
     great ships that descended from the sky, but there's no description
     of the Wraith themselves. Although there were a few among us who
     guessed that Daimos might be one of them.

     TEYLA
     Why?

     GORAN
     Because it, too, came from the sky.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Goran describes what happened as scenes from the time are shown.]

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     It was about ten years ago. A bright light appeared above the
     village...

   [Goran and others watch a light streak across the sky and into the
   ground over the horizon.]

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     ...crashed into the hills. We didn't know what it was, but people
     were terrified.

     YOUNGER GORAN
     Hurry, get in the house.

     VILLAGER
     Come on!

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [The villagers hunt for the downed ship.]

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     I went with some of the other men to investigate.

     MAN
     Over here!

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     We found the wreckage, a few wounded survivors.

   [Wounded Wraith lie on the ground amidst the wreckage.]

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     We didn't know what they were. We decided to take no chances.

   [The villagers kill the Wraith with primitive wooden weapons and axes.]

   EXT--FOREST, NIGHT

   [The villagers burn the Wraith bodies in a large bonfire.]

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     We slaughtered them, burned the bodies.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--TAVERN

     RONON
     Wise decision.

     GORAN
     Unfortunately we didn't get them all and although none of us saw it,
     evidently one of them survived.

   FLASHBACK

   INT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   [The villagers come back. A woman screams at what she sees -- a
   desiccated body.]

     GORAN

     (voiceover)
     It took its first victim that very night. We tried to hunt it down,
     but we couldn't find it.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--TAVERN

     GORAN
     It's been out there ever since. It feeds three, four times a year.
     Takes two or three people each time. Two years after the crash, it
     took my own son.

     RONON
     That's it? One Wraith, in the forest?

     GORAN
     Yes.

   [Ronon loads his weapon and starts to stand.]

     RONON
     I'll be done by morning.

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa, whoa. We'll all go together, in the daylight.

     BARKEEP
     You're really going to help us?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, like the man said, it's just one Wraith. It'd be downright
     unneighborly if we didn't.

     BARKEEP
     In that case, drinks are on me.

   [Ronon sits back down.]

     MCKAY
     Uh, well, let's not forget the food.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [McKay works on an instrument as villagers walk by. He notices a boy
   watching him and becomes annoyed.]

     MCKAY
     What?

     BOY

     (approaching)
     Is it true? You're going to hunt the Daimos?

     MCKAY
     It looks that way.

     BOY
     I heard it has two heads, and it can turn you to stone just by
     looking at you.

     MCKAY
     Well, you heard wrong.

     BOY
     My uncle says it'll come and take me if I don't do my chores.

     MCKAY
     He said that, huh? Well, then, if we get rid of it, you've got
     nothing to worry about, you'll never have to do chores ever again.

     BOY
     Really?

     MCKAY
     Yes. Look, go away.

   [The boy walks away. McKay looks up to see Sheppard, Teyla and Ronon
   looking at him with chastisement.]

     MCKAY
     What?

   [Goran joins them.]

     GORAN
     As far as we know, no one was taken last night, but it will strike,
     and soon.

     RONON

     (loading his gun)
     We'll kill it before that happens.

     SHEPPARD
     You must be great at parties.

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [They search through the forest, Ronon leading the way.]

     MCKAY
     We're talking about a hundred square miles of forest here.

     SHEPPARD
     Be patient. Ronon's been going up against the Wraith one on one for
     the last seven years. If anyone can track this thing, it's him.

     MCKAY
     And exactly how is he going to do that, huh?

     RONON

     (from a distance)
     It helps to have good hearing.

     MCKAY
     Right.

   [Sheppard slaps McKay on the back of the head as he walks past.]

     MCKAY
     Carry on.

   [Later, Sheppard and Teyla walk together.]

     SHEPPARD
     What about you? You sensing anything?

     TEYLA
     I'm not sure.

     SHEPPARD
     What do you mean?

     TEYLA
     There is a presence here...but it is different. I cannot quite
     explain it.

   [Ronon holds up his hand, then gestures for them to look ahead.]

     RONON
     It's in there.

   [The see a flash of the Wraith running behind a tree. Ronon runs toward
   it.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon! Damn it.

   [They all follow, chasing the Wraith through the forest. Ronon arrives
   outside a cave; the others arrive in a moment.]

     RONON
     It's in there.

     SHEPPARD
     Was it Wraith?

     RONON
     Yeah.

     MCKAY
     You see it?

     RONON
     No.

     MCKAY
     Well, how do you know?

     TEYLA
     Ronon is correct. I can definitely sense it now.

   [They turn on their gun flashlights and go inside.]

   INT--CAVE

   [They make their way into the cave. In their flashlights they glimpse a
   young, female Wraith.]

     TEYLA
     A female.

   [She runs, and the team chases her. She runs into a laboratory built
   into the cave, with crossed beams and plants in the ceiling. An older
   man is there.]

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

     ZADDIK
     Ellia?

   [He hugs her protectively. The team runs in and raises their guns at
   them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Get out of the way.

     ZADDIK
     No, please. Don't shoot. She's not what you think... She's my
     daughter.

   [Sheppard and the others stare in shock and disgust.]

     ZADDIK
     She means you no harm.

     RONON
     She's a Wraith.

     ZADDIK
     Maybe so, but she's different. I swear to you.

     SHEPPARD
     Let me guess--Wraith with a heart of gold?

     ZADDIK
     She doesn't feed. She's never taken a human life.

     TEYLA
     How is that possible?

     ZADDIK
     Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you.

   [Sheppard does so, and the others follow.]

     ZADDIK
     It's all right.

     ELLIA
     Father...

     ZADDIK

     No, I won't let them hurt you.
     (to the team)
     I raised her as my own.

     TEYLA
     You live here, together?

     ZADDIK
     This was part of a mine before the last culling. It's not much to
     look at, I know, but we don't have much choice. The people of the
     village would not understand.

     SHEPPARD
     Gee, I wonder why.

     TEYLA
     The villagers told us there was a Wraith in the forest. It came here
     in a crashed ship ten years ago.

     ZADDIK
     Ten years ago? Ellia was just a child. Do you really think that she
     could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after
     the crash?

     MCKAY
     So you know about that, then?

     ZADDIK
     I was there. I helped kill the survivors.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [We see Zaddik's point of view as he finds young Ellia on the ground.]

     ZADDIK

     (voiceover)
     But when I found a young female lying unconscious some distance from
     the crash...I couldn't bring myself to hurt her. I brought her here
     to this cave to hide her from the others. To this day, the people of
     the village don't know, and you must promise not to tell them. She's
     not responsible for what's been happening.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

     RONON
     Then who is?

     ZADDIK
     I believe another Wraith survived the crash. An adult. That's who
     you should be looking for.

     TEYLA
     If she does not feed, how does she live?

     ZADDIK
     At first I fed her as you would any child and that seemed to
     suffice. But then something began to change.

   [As he speaks, McKay looks around at the lab, which has various
   old-fashioned chemical components.]

     ZADDIK
     The food no longer gave her any sustenance. There was a hunger
     growing in her that would not be satisfied. I heard the stories of
     the other creature, what it did to survive, and I was afraid that
     was what Ellia would become. And so I... started to experiment. I
     have extensive knowledge of the chemical properties of various
     medicinal plants that grow in this forest. Are you interested in
     science?

     MCKAY
     I'm not sure that's what I would call this, but yes.

     ZADDIK
     Ellia's hunger was growing stronger every day, and I wasn't sure
     that I could do anything for her. But eventually... I came up with
     this.

   [He holds up a flask.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Sheppard briefs Weir and Beckett.]

     WEIR
     A drug that allows the Wraith to survive without feeding?

     SHEPPARD
     That's what he said.

     WEIR
     Is such a thing even possible?

     BECKETT
     We don't know enough about Wraith physiology to say for certain,
     although, I must admit, it's intriguing that this Dr. Zaddik claims
     the Wraith survived on normal food for a time.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     BECKETT
     Well, if he's telling the truth, it might be the answer to a very
     puzzling question. Right now, our best guess is that the Wraith
     evolved from the iratus bug.

     SHEPPARD
     Like the one that attached itself to my neck a year ago?

     BECKETT
     That's right.

     SHEPPARD
     I hate those bugs.

     BECKETT
     Trust me, I know. We've speculated that they evolved into the Wraith
     when they began to take on the characteristics of the humans they
     were feeding on. Now, there are many aspects of human physiology
     that are quite useful--bipedal motion, opposable thumbs, large brain
     capacity. But the human digestive system serves no purpose in the
     adult Wraith. So, why have one at all?

     WEIR
     Because they eat normal food when they're young.

     BECKETT
     Exactly then at some point, they lose the ability to sustain
     themselves with that food.

     SHEPPARD
     So it's a teenage thing--pimples, rebellion, life-sucking.

     BECKETT
     Something like that. The question is, what causes it? If it's due to
     some chemical deficiency, like a diabetic's inability to process
     sugar, then it's possible it may be addressed with some kind of
     drug.

     WEIR
     So Zaddik could be telling the truth.

     BECKETT
     I'd like to go to the planet and check into it.

     WEIR
     Is that really necessary? I'm sure we could get a sample, bring it
     back here for you to analyze.

     BECKETT
     It's not just the drug I'm interested in. This young Wraith could be
     very important for our research.

     SHEPPARD
     What research?

     BECKETT
     We're working on a retrovirus that would alter Wraith DNA,
     essentially stripping out the iratus bug elements of their genetic
     code and leaving only the human aspects behind.

     SHEPPARD
     A drug that turns Wraith into humans?

     BECKETT
     Effectively, yes. But so far, we haven't had much success, partly
     because we lack the living tissue and blood samples we need to test
     it.

     WEIR

     (to Sheppard)
     You think this girl would be willing to provide them?

   [Sheppard starts to shrug.]

     BECKETT
     Look, I realize we can't bring her back to Atlantis but I could take
     the retrovirus and the equipment necessary for the analysis with me
     to the planet. A few days with a cooperative test subject could be
     worth months of theoretical research. Elizabeth, I don't have to
     tell you how important this could be for us.

     WEIR

     (to Sheppard)
     Is she dangerous?

     SHEPPARD
     She's a Wraith.

     SHEPPARD
     Although... I have to admit she does seem a little different.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [Ellia is grinding leaves with a mortar and pestel.]

     ZADDIK
     Remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground.

     ELLIA
     Like this?

   [He starts to walk around. The liquid in the flask is boiling.]

     ZADDIK
     A little more. Now...why is distillation an important step?

     ELLIA
     To remove the toxins from the Ferassin root?

     ZADDIK
     Precisely. We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic
     shock, now, would we?

     ELLIA

     (smiling and rolling her eyes)
     No, Father.

     MCKAY
     Seriously, have you seen anything like this before?

     TEYLA
     No, I have not. She is unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.

     MCKAY
     What if it's all an act?

     TEYLA
     If she were a killer, why would he protect her?

     MCKAY
     Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too.

     TEYLA
     They live here together, Rodney. If she were like other Wraith, he
     would be her first victim.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Teyla, this is Sheppard.

     TEYLA

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard, Beckett, and Ronon are walking.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     We just got back with Beckett. Ronon's going to take him up to the
     cave. I'm going to check in with the villagers.

     TEYLA

     (over radio)
     What are you going to tell them?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I'm still working on that.

   [They stop. Sheppard hands the equipment box he's been carrying to
   Ronon, then heads away to the village.]

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [Beckett starts to unload his equipment, starting with a laptop.]

     ZADDIK
     This equipment's remarkable. Where did you get it?

     BECKETT
     Oh, here and there. Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours,
     shall we?

     ZADDIK
     Oh, yes. Of course.

   [Ellia arrives, and Beckett sees her for the first time.]

     ELLIA
     Would you like some tea?

     ZADDIK
     Oh, thank you.

   [She hands a cup to McKay, who reluctantly takes it.]

     BECKETT
     Oh, no thank you.

     ELLIA

     (to Ronon)
     Would you like some?

     RONON
     No.

     ELLIA
     Are you sure? It's very good.

     RONON
     I said no.

   [She puts the tray down and brings back a plate of biscuits.]

     ELLIA
     Maybe some biscuits? I baked them myself.

   [He slams the plate out of her hand, furious.]

     RONON
     Stay away from me!

   [Ellia screams at him in a Wraith voice. Ronon draws his weapon and
   aims it at her.]

     TEYLA

     (holding up a hand to stop him)
     Ronon!

   [Ellia rushes out of the lab. Zaddik follows.]

   INT--CAVE

   [Ellia is sitting on the ground, crying. Zaddik sits beside her.]

     ZADDIK
     It's all right. It's okay.

     ELLIA
     They hate me, don't they, Father?

     ZADDIK
     No. No, no, no. They just don't know you.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

     TEYLA
     Was that really necessary?

     RONON
     You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but that's not
     going to change who she is.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Teyla, this is Sheppard. Come in.

     TEYLA

     (into radio)
     Go ahead, Colonel.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Is Ellia still in the cave?

     TEYLA

     (into radio)
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Has she been there the whole time?

     TEYLA

     (into radio)
     Yes. Why?

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Villagers are gathered around a desiccated body.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     They just found another victim. Apparently he's only been missing
     for a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it. It
     looks like Zaddik might have been telling the truth after all.

   [The dead body is wheeled by on a hay cart.]

     VILLAGER
     We must defend ourselves.

     FEMALE VILLAGER
     There they are.

     GORAN
     Colonel Sheppard. Is there any progress with this hunt?

     SHEPPARD
     We're working on it.

     GORAN
     Maybe we could help you.

     SHEPPARD
     That won't be necessary.

     BARKEEP
     We're sick of doing nothing. We're sick of being afraid all the
     time. That thing is hunting in daylight now. We'll never be safe.

     SHEPPARD
     Just be patient. We'll take care of it.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [Sheppard has joined them.]

     ZADDIK
     You see? I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings. The
     serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.

     SHEPPARD
     Can you confirm that?

     BECKETT
     Not yet. It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Well, in the meantime, there's another Wraith out there.

     TEYLA
     I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.

     ZADDIK
     How?

     TEYLA
     May I speak with her?

     ZADDIK
     All right.

   INT--ELLIA'S BEDROOM IN CAVE

   [Ellia is sitting on her bed. Teyla joins her.]

     TEYLA
     May I join you?

   [Ellia looks up then away. Teyla enters.]

     TEYLA
     Ellia, we need your help. You can sense the other Wraith.

   [Ellia looks away.]

     TEYLA
     It is all right. It is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, I have the
     same ability.

     ELLIA
     Really?

     TEYLA
     I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us. And I knew
     even then that you were different. Your father has raised you well.
     He has taught you right from wrong. You are not like the other one.

     ZADDIK
     I don't let him in. I don't like what he shows me.

     TEYLA
     I know but you have to try. Now, we need to find him.

     ELLIA
     You don't understand.

     TEYLA
     I have tried myself, but I can get nothing. Please.

     ELLIA
     All right.

     TEYLA
     Good. Now, concentrate.

   [Ellia sees scenes of the forest. She comes back, gasping.]

     TEYLA
     Try again.

   [She sees the forest again, and a river bank.]

     ELLIA
     I saw a river.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [Teyla enters.]

     TEYLA
     Zaddik? Is there a river nearby?

     ZADDIK
     Yes, just to the east.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, let's go. McKay, stay here and help Beckett.

     MCKAY
     Uh, medical research is not really my thing.

     SHEPPARD
     And hunting Wraith?

     MCKAY
     But, I mean, I can stay...and help Beckett.

   [Sheppard and the others leave.]

     MCKAY
     Never could get into biology. There's just too much information
     about the human body. One time, I took it as an undergrad, I
     diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions
     before I had to drop the class.

     BECKETT
     Really.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, believe it or not, back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac.

     BECKETT
     You know, this does require a certain amount of concentration.

     MCKAY

     (teasing)
     What, am I bothering you?... Maybe I'll go get some air.

   [McKay leaves.]

   EXT--NEAR RIVER ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon arrive.]

     TEYLA
     This must be the river she saw in her vision.

     SHEPPARD
     Assuming she's telling the truth. Just because there's another
     Wraith doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her.

   [Ronon finds a print in the sand.]

     SHEPPARD
     What do you got?

     RONON
     Fresh tracks. It's him.

     TEYLA
     Now do you believe?

     SHEPPARD
     I still think there's something more to this than she and Zaddik are
     telling us.

     RONON
     He's heading upstream, into the hills.

   [They move on.]

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [Beckett continues to test Zaddik's medicine.]

     ZADDIK

     (to Beckett)
     Let me ask you something. If you can prove to everyone that I'm
     telling the truth, that Ellia no longer needs to feed, do you think
     the villagers would accept her?

   [Beckett doesn't look hopeful.]

     ZADDIK
     That's what I'm afraid of.

   [Ellia is eavesdropping on the conversation.]

     ZADDIK
     No matter how hard we try to convince them, they'll always see her
     as a monster. I'm getting old, doctor.

     BECKETT
     Oh, you've got lots of time.

     ZADDIK
     Never have as much as we think you have. And when I'm gone, she'll
     be alone. I...tried to teach her about love and human companionship.
     But that's exactly what she'll never have.

   [Ellia looks down in sadness at what she hears.]

     BECKETT
     Zaddik, there's something I want to show you. I didn't say anything
     at first, because I didn't want to get your hopes up.

   [He opens a case and takes out a metal vial.]

     BECKETT
     It's a retrovirus...something I've been working on.

     ZADDIK
     I don't understand.

     BECKETT
     Oh, God. How am I going to explain this? Part of Ellia is human, and
     part of her comes from a creature we call the iratus bug. It's the
     part that makes her look the way she does and where her desire to
     feed comes from. Now, it's possible, by means of this retrovirus, we
     can strip away those parts, and leave only the human parts behind.

     ZADDIK

     (smiling hopefully)
     You mean she'd be like you and me?

     BECKETT
     Yes. Now, I must warn you, the retrovirus is still experimental. In
     fact, it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so
     far, without much success. I'm hoping that what we can learn from
     your daughter will help me perfect it.

   [McKay rushes in.]

     MCKAY
     We've got a problem.

     BECKETT
     Why didn't you just radio me?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well, I could've, but...

   [McKay, Beckett, and Zaddik rush out. After they are gone, Ellia comes
   in and opens Beckett's case, the one with the retrovirus.]

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [McKay, Beckett, and Zaddik take up a position where they can see a
   group of villagers walking on a path in the forest.]

     VILLAGER
     This way.

     BECKETT
     Looks like they decided to join the hunt.

     ZADDIK
     If they find Ellia, they'll kill her.

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Sheppard, this is McKay.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard answers from where they are hunting the Wraith.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     What is it, Rodney?

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     The villagers are on the move, and it doesn't look like they're
     going to a picnic.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Are they heading for the caves?

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Not at the moment, no.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     All right. Get back there and sit tight.
     (to Ronon and Teyla)
     We're losing time, guys.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [Beckett, McKay, and Zaddik return. They look around.]

     ZADDIK
     Ellia? Ellia? She's not here.

   [Beckett sees a vial has been moved inside his case.]

     BECKETT
     Good Lord.

     MCKAY
     What?

     BECKETT
     She took the retrovirus.

     ZADDIK
     You said it wasn't ready.

     BECKETT
     It's not, not by a long shot.

     ZADDIK
     What'll it do to her?

     BECKETT
     To be honest, I have no idea.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla continue to search.]

   [The conversation switches between the lab and Sheppard's position.]

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, come in.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     We've got another problem. Ellia's gone, and she's injected herself
     with the retrovirus.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Why would she do that?

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     She must've overheard us talking about it. I told Zaddik it might be
     the key to making her human.

     ZADDIK
     Please, you've got to find her before the villagers do.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Look, Ronon says we're close. If we lose the trail now, we may never
     catch the Wraith.

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     Rodney and I will find her.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     All right, but be careful.

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     Understood.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

     ZADDIK
     I'll come with you.

     BECKETT
     No, I think it's best if you stay here.

     MCKAY
     Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go--any favorite hiding
     spots or favorite places?

     ZADDIK
     Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills. I
     don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me.

     BECKETT
     It's a start.

   [McKay and Beckett leave.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [McKay and Beckett search.]

     MCKAY
     You know, I thought it was pretty nuts when Ronon was trying to
     track a Wraith through this forest.

     BECKETT
     Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?

     MCKAY
     Oh, yeah. Supremely confident.

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

     ELLIA
     Father.

     ZADDIK

     (seeing her)
     Ellia.

   [They embrace.]

     ZADDIK
     Oh...where did you go?

     ELLIA
     I was hiding. I didn't want the others to know...

     ZADDIK
     To know what? Ellia, why did you take the retrovirus?

     ELLIA
     Because I don't want to be this way anymore. I hate what I am.

     ZADDIK
     If you heard what Dr. Beckett said, you know the retrovirus isn't
     ready.

     ELLIA
     I had no choice. When they kill the other Wraith, I won't be able to
     pretend anymore.

     ZADDIK
     Pretend what?

     ELLIA
     I've wanted to tell you for a long time... Your serum doesn't work,
     Father. It never has.

     ZADDIK

     (smiling reassuringly)
     That's impossible. It's been two years since you... Since the last
     time. That wasn't your fault. It was my idea. I needed time to
     perfect the formula.

     ELLIA
     But it wasn't working. The hunger just...got worse.

     ZADDIK

     (realizing)
     What did you do?

     ELLIA
     I'm sorry, Father.

     ZADDIK
     No. No, that was the other one.

     ELLIA
     It was both of us. I sensed him out there. I knew when he was
     feeding, and I would go out at the same time.

     ZADDIK
     No. No, it can't be.

   [Ellia grunts and bends over in pain.]

     ZADDIK
     Ellia?

     ELLIA
     Stay away!

     ZADDIK
     What is it? What's happening?

   [She grimaces in pain. Her hand starts to change color to dark purple,
   like an iratus bug. The color change moves up to her face. She
   screeches.]

     ZADDIK
     Let me help you.

   [She pushes him away.]

     ELLIA
     No!

   [She runs out. Zaddik stays behind, terrified.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Ronon checks a small cave with strings of cloth hanging outside it.]

     RONON
     Sheppard. This is where he's been making camp. He was here less than
     hour ago.

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [McKay and Beckett hunt elsewhere.]

     MCKAY
     You hear anything?

     BECKETT
     No.

     MCKAY
     Huh. Me neither.

   [A Wraith drops down from a tree right beside Beckett. It hits him and
   knocks him flying. McKay gets off a couple of shots, then the Wraith
   knocks the gun out of his hand and him to the ground.]

   [Nearby, Sheppard and the others hear the shots and go running in that
   direction.]

   [At McKay's location, the Wraith starts to lean over McKay, but Ellia
   arrives and tackles the Wraith. They fight for a moment, and Ellia
   breaks the Wraith's neck. Ellia's skin is much darker and her left hand
   is claw-like. She advances on McKay with a threatening expression.]

     MCKAY
     Easy, now. You went through the trouble to save my life. It'd be a
     shame to kill me.

   [Beckett shoots Ellia, wounding her in the shoulder. She screeches at
   him then runs away.]

     BECKETT
     You all right, Rodney?

     MCKAY

     (shakily, grasping at his chest)
     Yeah, just peachy. What the hell was that?

     BECKETT
     The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.

     MCKAY
     I guess so.

     BECKETT
     Oh, God.

     MCKAY
     On the...yeah, but...

   [Beckett pats him reassuringly. He mumbles and puts his hand up under
   his tee-shirt to feel for a feeding wound.]

   [Elsewhere in the forest, Zaddik finds Ellia.]

     ZADDIK
     Ellia? You poor girl. You never deserved this.

   [She growls and approaches him.]

     ZADDIK
     I know part of you is still there.

   [She snarls and grabs him by the neck.]

     ZADDIK
     Aah! Ellia, please. This isn't you.

   [She throws him hard into the hillside. She stands and screeches
   loudly. Both Atlantis groups hear her and run toward the sound.]

   [McKay and Beckett find Zaddik lying on the forest floor.]

     MCKAY
     Zaddik!

     BECKETT
     Are you all right?

   [He grunts in pain.]

     BECKETT
     Don't try to move.

     ZADDIK
     It was Ellia...but it wasn't her fault.

     VILLAGER
     Over here! Here, come on!

   [Goran and other villagers arrive.]

     MCKAY
     No, no, no! You people need to go back to the village! It is not
     safe here.

     GORAN
     Who is that?

     ZADDIK
     Don't you remember me?

     GORAN
     No...it can't be... You were taken by the daimos.

     ZADDIK
     No, Father.

     MCKAY
     Father? I don't understand. You're...you're his son?

     GORAN
     If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old.

     ZADDIK
     Precisely.

   [Sheppard's group has arrived.]

     BARKEEP
     There's another one of those things out there. Look what it did to
     Zaddik. I say we go after it, now!

     SHEPPARD
     No one's going anywhere. We'll handle this. Stay calm. How is he?

   [Beckett stops over to talk to them.]

     BECKETT
     I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too
     severe. He's not going to make it.

     GORAN
     This can't be happening. It's not possible.

     ZADDIK
     I'm sorry. Don't blame Ellia. It was my idea. You...have to have to
     understand...that when I found her, I'd just lost my own wife and
     son to a fever.

   FLASHBACK

   [Zaddik finds Ellia after the crash.]

     ZADDIK

     (voiceover)
     She was just lying there, helpless. When I saw her, I knew what I
     had to do. As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and
     water like any young girl.

   [Zaddik lifts up the Wraith child and carries it away.]

   INT--LABORATORY IN CAVE

   [A younger Ellia collapses in pain, the younger Zaddik comforting her.]

     ELLIA
     No. No!

     YOUNGER ZADDIK
     It's all right. Take what you need.

     ELLIA
     I can't.

   [He takes her hand and puts it to his chest. She begins to feed off of
   him.]

     YOUNGER ZADDIK
     Yes, you can.

   END FLASHBACK

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

     ZADDIK
     She took what she needed from me to survive...until I perfected the
     serum.

   FLASHBACK

   [Zaddik collapses after Ellia finishes feeding.]

     ELLIA
     Father? Father? I'm so sorry.

   [She holds him, sobbing; he is only slightly more aged than he was.]

   END FLASHBACK

     SHEPPARD
     She never fed on anyone after that?

     ZADDIK

     (after a hesitation)
     No.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Teyla, Ronon, you're with me. The rest of you, stay here.

     BECKETT
     Colonel, the retrovirus is acting quickly. The human part of her is
     almost gone.

     SHEPPARD
     You said she killed the other Wraith and saved McKay's life.

     BECKETT
     Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing. She's operating
     on a purely animal level right now.

     TEYLA
     Is there nothing you can do for her?

     BECKETT
     I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring her back alive,
     but I doubt she'll cooperate. She's also stronger and faster than
     any Wraith I've ever seen.

     SHEPPARD

     (in a high-pitched, sarcastic voice)
     Great.

     GORAN

     (to Zaddik, upset)
     All this time... We thought you were dead.

     ZADDIK
     There was no other way. They never would have accepted us...And I
     couldn't abandon her.

     GORAN
     Why?

     ZADDIK
     She...needed me.

   [Goran appears very upset.]

   [Elsewhere in the forest, Sheppard and Teyla walk.]

     BECKETT

     (over radio)
     Colonel, this is Beckett.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     BECKETT

     (over radio)
     Zaddik's dead.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Understood.

   [Ronon has stopped.]

     RONON
     She knows we're here. She's watching us.

     TEYLA

     (sensing Ellia)
     Ellia? We want to help you. Dr. Beckett can make you better, but you
     have to come with us. We will not hurt you.

   [Ellia tackles Teyla to the ground. They struggle, an Teyla throws her
   off. Sheppard and Ronon hear it and come running.]

     RONON
     Die!

   [Ronon shoots Ellia, but she runs away. Ronon and Sheppard stop to
   check Teyla. She is unconscious and has blood on the back of her head.]

     RONON
     She took a blow to the head when it hit her.

     SHEPPARD
     Stay with her.

   [Sheppard takes his jacket off for Ronon to use to pillow Teyla's
   head.]

     RONON
     Sheppard--

     SHEPPARD
     That's an order.

   [Sheppard runs off.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Sheppard hunts Ellia, but she is watching him.]

   [Teyla wakes up.]

     RONON
     Teyla?

     TEYLA
     What happened? Where's Colonel Sheppard?

     RONON
     He went after the creature.

     TEYLA
     You let him go alone?

     RONON
     Well, he wanted me to stay with you.

     TEYLA

     (exasperated)
     I am fine. Go.

     RONON
     Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?

     TEYLA
     Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.

     RONON
     Who decides when it's one of those times?

     TEYLA
     We do.

     RONON
     That's good enough.

   [He jumps up and runs off.]

   [At Sheppard's position, he turns to see Ellia approaching him along a
   large downed tree.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ellia? Don't make me do this.

   [She screeches at him. He shoots her with the machine gun as she
   attacks him, but she lands on him and tries to attack. He pulls his
   knife, but she holds that arm away from her. While she does that, her
   left-hand claw cuts his right arm. Blood flows from the wound. Ronon
   arrives and shoots Ellia. Sheppard rolls away. Ronon shoots her again.
   Then Ronon and Sheppard both fire on her, killing her.]

     RONON
     You okay?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. She tried feeding on me.

     RONON
     She wasn't going to let us take her back.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. I know.

   [Ronon starts to walk back the way he came. Sheppard looks at his arm,
   which is bloody from three puncture marks. He looks at Ellia again,
   then turns to follow Ronon.]

   FADE OUT
