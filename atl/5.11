   TEASER

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Teyla steps out of a transporter.]

     TEYLA
     Move quickly! We have to get everyone to the lower levels of the
     tower to make sure that everyone will be--

   [An explosion rocks the corridor.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS TOWER

   [The Gate Room area of the tower explodes, blowing out the windows.
   Smoke curls through the broken windows.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [The power goes out. People hurry, speaking in scared mutterings.]

     TEYLA

     (into radio, worried)
     Colonel Sheppard, are you all right? John?!

   [Marie approaches Teyla.]

     MARIE
     Teyla, how many were up there?

     TEYLA
     Two.

     MARIE
     I'll go get my people.

   [Marie races off.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [The only light is from sunlight in the broken window and flashlights
   carried by Teyla and the search and rescue team. The area is scorched
   and blackened; the Stargate is gone.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Debris still falls and sparks fly across short circuits. The room is
   unrecognizable.]

     TEYLA
     John?! They were right here when I left them.

     MARIE
     If the explosion was hot enough, there might not be anything left
     for us to find.

   [In the distance can be heard a weak groan.]

     TEYLA
     Did you hear that?

   [Marie nods. The groan is louder and seems to be coming from Woolsey's
   office.]

   INT--WOOLSEY'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard has bodily covered Zelenka as they both lie prone on the
   floor. Shards of glass cover the room, including Sheppard. Teyla and
   Marie rush in with the team.]

     TEYLA
     John!

     SHEPPARD

     (groaning, confused)
     We need to take cover.

   [Marie and Teyla help him up.]

     TEYLA
     Are you all right?

     SHEPPARD
     Huhn?

     TEYLA

     (louder)
     Are you all right?

     SHEPPARD
     My ears...I think I got some glass in my back.

     TEYLA
     Marie...

   [Marie leads the stiff Sheppard away. Teyla crouches down by Zelenka,
   who's starting to move.]

     ZELENKA
     We lost the Stargate. We lost the control room. That's bad.

     TEYLA
     But we did not lose you. That's good.

   [Teyla nods to another member of the rescue team.]

     TEYLA

     (smiling)
     Okay.

   [The man helps Teyla lead Zelenka away.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus floats near Todd's hive ship.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Woolsey sits propped against a bulkhead, unconscious. Todd sits in the
   commander's chair. Kenny enters.]

     KENNY
     All the troops you've requested have beamed on board.

     TODD
     Have them round up the rest of the humans and confine them to one of
     the hangar bays.

   [Another Wraith nods and does as Todd bids, leading a troop of soldier
   Wraith out.]

     TODD
     Inform our hive to wait for us here. And under no circumstances are
     they to activate their hyperdrive. Is that understood?

     KENNY
     Yes. Where are we going?

     TODD
     Atlantis.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Power is on in this area. Marie picks several small shards of glass
   out of Sheppard's back with forceps. Sheppard grunts in pain. Teyla
   approaches.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to Teyla)
     I need you to get Banks and her team to set up an auxiliary control
     room below the damaged areas.

     TEYLA

     (nodding)
     They've already begun. How are you?

     SHEPPARD
     Ach! Well, I'm alive. You know, that's good for now.

     TEYLA
     I still do not understand what happened.

     SHEPPARD
     The 'gate blew up.

     TEYLA

     (drily)
     That much I surmised. But why?

     SHEPPARD

     (shaking his head)
     I don't know. Where the hell's McKay when you need him, huh?

   EXT--ANCIENT FACILITY, DAY

   [The center of the facility is lit up in a blue glow from the active
   Attero device.]

   INT--ANCIENT SEALED ROOM

   [Daniel sits, leaning against a wall in their latest makeshift prison
   cell. McKay paces nervously in front of him.]

     MCKAY
     All right, so the device creates a very specific subspace
     "turbulence" that makes it impossible for the Wraith to operate
     their hyperdrives.

     DANIEL

     (resigned)
     You said that already.

     MCKAY
     But there's a side-effect.

     DANIEL
     Yes, the unforeseen one that Janus mentions.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well, it's certainly not "seen" here, because there's no
     Stargate on this planet.

     DANIEL

     (aggravated)
     What's the point, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Look, although the subspace turbulence only affects the Wraith's
     hyperdrive systems, it creates a very dangerous type of radiation
     that, uh, well...that messes with the basic operation of the
     Stargates.

     DANIEL

     (alert)
     Stargates? What, as in all of them?

     MCKAY
     Well, all of the Stargates in the Pegasus network, yes.

     DANIEL
     And when you say "messes with," you mean what?

     MCKAY
     Look, when dialed, power will build up inside the 'gate until it
     overloads.

   [Daniel stands.]

     DANIEL
     So, you're saying that as long as this Janus device is running,
     every time someone dials a 'gate in the entire galaxy...

     MCKAY
     It'll explode. I mean, millions of people will die if we don't shut
     that thing down.

   [They exchange very worried looks.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Woolsey awakens to find Todd hovering over him.]

     TODD
     Good timing, Mister Woolsey.

   [A Wraith soldier drags him to his feet.]

     WOOLSEY

     (with bravado)
     Look, I don't know what it is you think we've done, but I assure
     you--

     TODD

     (to Kenny)
     Take us out of hyperspace.

     KENNY
     We haven't arrived in Atlantis yet.

     WOOLSEY

     (shocked)
     Atlantis?

     TODD

     We're within communications range. We don't want to get too close.
     Take us out.
     (to Woolsey)
     I was hoping you'd be awake for this.

   INT--ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

   [Zelenka and Banks's team have set up computers on tables and are
   bringing in more equipment. Power is restored to this area. Sheppard
   and Teyla enter.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, are we up and running?

     BANKS
     Yes, sir. We've routed all the city's main controls into this room.

     SHEPPARD
     At least we're not blind anymore.

     ZELENKA
     No, but we're severely crippled. And without the 'gate or the
     ability to reach the Daedalus, we have no way of getting to M6H-987
     or rescuing Rodney and Doctor Jackson.

     TEYLA
     What should we do?

     SHEPPARD

     (loudly)
     Five bucks to anybody who can figure out how to contact the
     Daedalus.

   [Banks sits at her laptop. It blinks an alert.]

     BANKS
     Uh, Colonel Sheppard?

     SHEPPARD
     You got an idea, Banks?

     BANKS
     Well, no, but I am being hailed by the Daedalus on subspace. Does
     that count?

     SHEPPARD

     (surprised)
     Technically, that's not your idea, but good enough. Put 'em on
     screen.

   [He and Teyla move to the communications monitor. Sheppard taps Banks
   on the shoulder as he passes.]

     SHEPPARD
     Don't worry, I'll pay you later.

   [They wait for screen to stop being static.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into videocom)
     Daedalus! It's good to, uh--

   [The image clears. They are shocked to find Todd on the screen.]

     TODD
     Colonel Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell's going on? Where's Caldwell?

     TODD
     I'm afraid I had to relieve him and his crew of duty.

     SHEPPARD

     (low, to Zelenka)
     How close are they?

     ZELENKA

     (low, to Sheppard)
     Not close enough to go by jumper, if that's what you're thinking.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The conversation switches between the Daedalus bridge and Atlantis.]

     TODD
     Don't worry. I'm more than willing to return this ship and its crew
     to you.

     SHEPPARD

     (suspicious)
     In exchange for what?

     TODD
     You've activated the Attero Device. I need you to shut it down and
     give me its location immediately.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know what you're talking about!

     TODD
     It was very clever of you, luring me and my ship out into the open
     so you could see for yourself if it worked.

     SHEPPARD
     If what worked?

     TODD
     I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed. I was there ten thousand
     years ago when the Ancients first tried to use it, but they didn't
     have the stomach to leave it on once they realized how many of their
     precious Stargates it would destroy...how many humans it would kill.

     ZELENKA

     (low, to Sheppard)
     Sounds like something Janus would've worked on.

     TODD
     Give me the location of the Attero device, and once I have destroyed
     it I will return this crew to you!

     SHEPPARD
     Look, it's not what you think. We have nothing to do with this!

     TODD
     Every minute that goes by without you telling me where this device
     is, I will kill a member of your expedition.

   [A Wraith soldier pulls Woolsey into view of the video camera. Teyla
   and Sheppard gasp.]

     ZELENKA
     Oh...

   [Todd puts his arm around Woolsey in a falsely familiar pose. Woolsey
   looks nauseous and frightened.]

     TODD
     Your time starts now.

     SHEPPARD
     Give us a second.

   [Sheppard gives a signal to Banks, and the monitor on the Daedalus
   reads "transmission suspended."]

     WOOLSEY
     I don't think this should count toward the minute. I-I mean, he
     didn't say "no"...yet.

   [Todd slowly turns to Woolsey and growls.]

   INT--ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     What are the odds that--that...what's this thing called?

     TEYLA
     Uh...Attero device?

     SHEPPARD
     What are the odds that this thing was at the other end of the
     subspace link that Rodney opened when he went to that lab?

     ZELENKA
     M6H-987? I'd say it's very likely. It's also very likely that's
     where he and Dr. Jackson were taken.

     TEYLA
     It must be a weapon that Janus developed during the Wraith war.

     SHEPPARD
     A weapon to blow up Stargates?

     ZELENKA
     I doubt that was its original design. It doesn't seem like an
     effective strategy.

     SHEPPARD
     So, a nasty side effect. That's probably why they stopped
     production.

     TEYLA
     Whatever the aliens took from the lab allowed them to reactivate it
     again.

     SHEPPARD
     Whatever it is, Todd seems pretty keen to stop it--enough to risk
     taking the Daedalus.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but we can't give him the address. If he gets it, he'll destroy
     everything in his path, including Rodney and Doctor Jackson.

   [Sheppard rubs his chin and sighs.]

     TEYLA

     (heaving a sigh)
     John, we don't have a choice. Our shield was able to take the brunt
     of the explosion, but if this is happening on other worlds, it could
     kill millions.

     SHEPPARD

     (waving to Banks)
     Put him back on.

   [The video link is reestablished and the conversation again switches
   between the bridge of the ship and Atlantis.]

     WOOLSEY

     (relieved)
     Oh, thank God.

     SHEPPARD
     We're not the ones behind this.

     TODD
     Very well.

   [Todd turns to Woolsey. A soldier holds him in place as he raises his
   hand to feed.]

     SHEPPARD
     W-w-wait! Wait! I said we're not the ones behind this, but we may
     have what you need.

     TEYLA
     Atlantis was attacked yesterday by a race we have not encountered
     before. It stole a piece of Ancient technology. We believe this
     could be a component to this...Attero device.

   [Todd's hand slowly moves to Woolsey's chest, where it clutches his
   lapel. Woolsey watches the proceedings with alarm.]

     SHEPPARD
     We managed to track them. Swing by here, pick me up, I will take you
     there myself.

     TODD
     And give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive with one of your
     drones? I think not.

   [Todd straightens his hand as if to feed.]

     SHEPPARD
     Why would I do that? Right now, you're one of the few people in the
     galaxy with a ship capable of dealing with this problem.

   [Todd again embraces Woolsey in this falsely companionable manner.]

     TODD
     And I intend to keep it that way. John Sheppard, transmit the
     coordinates, or I will feed on Mister Woolsey before your eyes!

   [Sheppard gives Todd a shrewd look. Not taking his eyes off Todd, he
   turns his head towards Banks.]

     SHEPPARD

     (tightly)
     Do it.

   [One of the Daedalus consoles blinks.]

     KENNY
     We have it.

     TODD
     We'll be in touch.

   [The link is severed. Teyla, Sheppard, and Zelenka exchange concerned
   looks.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus enters hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

   [Ronon tries to force the doors open with his bare hands. Keller
   watches with her arms crossed as he groans.]

     KELLER
     You really think that's going to work?

     RONON

     (groaning)
     You got a better idea?

     KELLER
     We're on a spaceship. Those doors are designed to be airtight. That
     means something as tiny as air can't even get through. How do you
     think you will?

     RONON
     Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.

     KELLER
     Yeah...that's kinda my point.

   [Ronon strains again, and this time his efforts are rewarded. The door
   opens. He turns back to Keller.]

     RONON

     (triumphant)
     See?

   [Keller's eyes widen in alarm as she spots the two Wraith in the
   corridor beyond.]

     KELLER
     Ronon!

   [She crouches as Ronon ducks and spins, shooting the two soldiers.]

     RONON
     You okay?

     KELLER

     (shaken)
     Yeah.

     RONON
     All right, come on.

     KELLER
     Wait. Wh-what's our plan? Where are we going?

     RONON
     We're going to get to an access ladder. We head down two floors to
     the engineering rooms, then we cripple the ship.

     KELLER

     (surprised)
     You...know how to do all that?

     RONON
     Yeah, don't you?

     KELLER
     Not really.

     RONON
     Watch and learn.

   [He leads the way.]

   INT--ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

     BANKS
     Hyperspace window opening.

     SHEPPARD
     Think Todd changed his mind?

     ZELENKA
     He might have realized just how crippled we are.

     BANKS
     We're being hailed.

     SHEPPARD
     Put it up.

   [A woman appears on the video screen.]

     KATANA
     My name is Katana Labrea. I'm a Traveler. Larrin sent me.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, is everything all right?

     KATANA
     No. As a matter of fact, it's not. Larrin was hoping you could tell
     us why the Stargates are blowing up.

   INT--ANCIENT SEALED ROOM

   [McKay studies the panels on the wall, trying to figure out how to open
   one. The door to the room opens and one of the armored aliens walks in.
   He points at Daniel.]

     ALIEN
     You. Come with me.

   [Daniel points at himself, surprised.]

     DANIEL
     Me? Why?

   [The alien unholsters his stunner. Daniel and McKay immediately raise
   their hands in surrender, McKay stepping in the line of fire.]

     DANIEL
     Hey!

     MCKAY
     Whoa! We'll both go! No need for that.

     ALIEN
     No.

     MCKAY

     (weakly)
     Well...I guess it...just must be your turn to use the fitness room.

     DANIEL
     Right.

   [Daniel walks past McKay, keeping his arms raised.]

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     Good luck.

     DANIEL

     (with false brightness)
     You too.

   [He steps out of the room at gunpoint.]

   INT--ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

   [Katana has joined the Lantians.]

     KATANA
     It was the first colony we'd built on the surface of a planet in a
     hundred generations, and it was leveled in an instant. I was in
     orbit when it happened. We could see the explosion from space. I've
     never witnessed anything that powerful.

     ZELENKA
     Mmm. The 'gates are made of naquadah, and when they become unstable,
     the size of the explosion is unimaginable.

     KATANA
     We lost three thousand people and two ships, including our Ancient
     vessel. Larrin would've come herself, but...

     SHEPPARD
     No, I'm sure she's got her hands full. Look, these aliens or whoever
     they are, they have two of our people hostage. They need to be
     stopped. We have coordinates but...we have no ship.

     KATANA
     Then I guess I got here just in time.

     SHEPPARD
     That's what I wanted to hear. Zelenka, you're with me.

   [He, Katana, and Zelenka start to leave.]

     TEYLA

     (protesting)
     John...!

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla, I need you to stay here, all right? The second Todd's done,
     there's nothing stopping him from turning that ship around and
     making a run at Atlantis. I need someone I trust to stay in charge
     here.

   [Teyla nods.]

     TEYLA
     Good luck.

   [They leave. Teyla looks worried and frustrated.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

   [The door to engineering opens. Before the Wraith in the room can
   react, Ronon shoots them both. He enters. Keller follows, closing the
   door behind them and pressing buttons on the panel.]

     KELLER
     I locked the door.

     RONON
     This won't take long.

     KELLER
     So what do we do? Bring up the main control systems and disable them
     one by one?

     RONON
     That's one way to go.

     KELLER
     Well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe though. Otherwise
     they could just turn them back on again. Do you have...some sort of
     a pass-code to make sure they're locked out once and for all?

   [Ronon opens up a panel under one of the consoles.]

     RONON
     Nope.

     KELLER
     Well, then what are you thinking?

   [Ronon looks at Keller and shoots the panel he's just opened behind
   him.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus drops out of hyperspace and comes to a dead stop.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KENNY
     We just dropped out of hyperspace.

     TODD
     I see that, yes. Why?

     KENNY
     I'm not sure. The computer seems to think it's due to battle damage.

     TODD
     Get our troops down to the engineering room. Someone's sabotaging
     this ship!

   INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

   [Ronon continues moving around the room, opening crystal trays and
   shooting them.]

     KELLER
     Wh-wh-what are you doing?!

     RONON
     Disabling the ship.

     KELLER
     You can't just blast away at vital systems like that!

   [Ronon casually shoots another tray.]

     KELLER
     What if you take out the life support system?!

     RONON

     Don't worry, the life support system's that tray.
     (he points to a tray under the one he just shot to pieces)
     At least, I'm pretty sure it is.

     KELLER

     (stammering)
     Okay, we're out of hyperspace. That's enough. C'mon.

   [Keller opens the door. Ronon shoots one final tray as Keller winces.
   They leave.]

   EXT--ANCIENT FACILITY, DAY

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel is shoved into the room by his guard. The head alien stands
   before the console.]

     HEAD ALIEN
     You wish to speak to me.

     DANIEL
     You're the leader...? You need to shut this device down immediately.

   [The head alien turns to face Daniel.]

     HEAD ALIEN
     No, I do not.

     DANIEL
     Okay, look, I-I understand wanting to destroy the Wraith. I do. But,
     uh, this...isn't the way.

     HEAD ALIEN
     I disagree.

     DANIEL
     Okay, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but this device
     has a serious side effect. It makes Stargates explode when they're
     activated.

     HEAD ALIEN
     We do not use the Stargates.

     DANIEL

     (nonplussed)
     Okay...but lots of other people do.

     HEAD ALIEN
     They are of no concern to us.

     DANIEL

     (biting his lip)
     So you're just going to let them die, millions of people across the
     galaxy...You're no better than the Wraith.

     HEAD ALIEN
     Perhaps. But we have little choice.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     HEAD ALIEN
     Our planet is dying. It can no longer sustain us. For the first time
     in countless generations, we must venture out into this galaxy
     again--a galaxy controlled by the Wraith. If we do not destroy them,
     they will destroy us. This is the way it must be.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Katana's Traveler ship flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Katana walks with Sheppard and Zelenka.]

     SHEPPARD
     The Wraith are ahead of us. As soon as they get to that planet,
     they're gonna open up with everything they've got. Trust me, they
     ain't going to be worried about collateral damage.

     ZELENKA
     The only chance we have to save our friends is to get there first.

   [Katana pauses by a bulkhead door.]

     KATANA
     You want speed? You've come to the right place.

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP ENGINEERING

   [Katana opens the door. The room is a mess of cables and greasy
   machinery. They step inside.]

     ZELENKA

     (dubious)
     This is your engineering room?

     KATANA
     That's right. It may not look like much, but trust me, we can outrun
     most anything in the Traveler's fleet. Mila?

   [An adolescent appears from behind them.]

     MILA
     Hey!

     KATANA
     This is Colonel Sheppard and Doctor Zelenka. They're from Atlantis.
     Mila's our chief engineer.

   [Mila passes them and grabs a tool from a cushion before heading to
   another part of the room.]

     ZELENKA

     (to Katana)
     She can't be more than sixteen years old.

     KATANA

     Fifteen, actually. She's been working on ships since she was four.
     (to Mila)
     We need to get where we're going as fast as possible. I want you to
     do whatever you can to maximize hyperdrive output.

     MILA
     No problem.

     SHEPPARD

     You know, uh, Zelenka knows a thing or two about hyperdrives
     himself. I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a hand.
     (to Zelenka)
     Who knows? Maybe you'll learn a thing or two.

   [He slaps a dubious Zelenka on the back as he and Katana leave. Zelenka
   moves forward, dodging sparking cables.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus floats in open space.]

   INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING

   [Soldier Wraith drag out the downed Wraith. Kenny and Todd study the
   damage.]

     KENNY
     The damage is significant.

     TODD

     Begin repairs. Every second the Attero device is active, we risk
     losing more and more of our alliance.
     (keys intercom)
     It has come to my attention that someone from the original crew has
     eluded capture...

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

   [Keller and Ronon walk down the corridor.]

     TODD

     (continuing over intercom)
     ...Your freedom has become a nuisance. Turn yourself in immediately,
     or we will begin killing off your friends, one-by-one.

   [Ronon looks amused. Keller looks frightened. She grabs his arm and
   they stop and face each other.]

     TODD

     (continuing over intercom)
     You have three minutes to comply.

     RONON
     He's bluffing.

     KELLER
     No, he's not.

   [She walks determinedly towards an elevator.]

     RONON
     Where are you going?

     KELLER
     I'm turning myself in.

     RONON
     No, you're not.

   [Keller turns back as the elevator opens.]

     KELLER
     He's gonna start killing people.

     RONON
     He's going to kill you.

   [Keller doesn't seem to have considered this possibility.]

     KELLER
     Well, I hope not.

     RONON
     We need to get armed, free these people, and take this ship back.

     KELLER
     Exactly. I turn myself in, and he'll think he's got us all. It buys
     you the time you need to do what you've got to do.

     RONON
     No. No, I'm not letting you do it.

     KELLER
     Ronon, listen to me--

     RONON
     Jennifer, no.

   [They face each other down in a silent test of wills. Keller looks away
   in capitulation.]

     KELLER
     Okay. You're right.

     RONON
     Okay. Come on.

   [Ronon leads the way. As soon as he turns his back, Keller races into
   the elevator.]

     RONON
     We're almost there anyways.

   [He turns as he hears the door shut. He glowers and growls angrily as
   he unholsters his gun.]

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CONTROL ROOM

     DANIEL

     (furious)
     We're talking about the deaths of millions of people. How can you be
     so callous? And what is it you're so afraid of? Why-why-why are you
     still in your battle armor? I can't hurt you. I know you're not
     human, and you're definitely not Wraith. And if you were an Ancient,
     you wouldn't have needed our help to activate the device, so...what
     are you?

   [The head alien turns away from Daniel. The armor retracts in the back.
   The alien inside steps out of the suit, which seals shut. The small
   alien steps into the light. Daniel is shocked to find himself looking
   at an Asgard.]

     DANIEL
     You're Asgard.

     ASGARD
     You've encountered our kind before?

     DANIEL
     No, not just encountered. I've...I've worked with them. Even called
     a few of them my friends.

     ASGARD
     Indeed.

     DANIEL
     Of course, the Asgard I knew were a...noble race who actually helped
     the human population in my galaxy.

     ASGARD
     And where are they now?

     DANIEL

     (sorrowful)
     Dead.

     ASGARD
     Hmm.

     DANIEL
     But that had nothing to do with us.

     ASGARD
     Are you certain?

     DANIEL
     They were clones. Copies of copies of copies, going back
     generations, and they suffered irreversible genetic degradation as a
     result. But...you probably already know that.

     ASGARD
     Of course, because we are clones as well, subject to the same law of
     diminishing returns. And yet...we are still very much alive.

     DANIEL
     So, what? You-you solved the problem?

     ASGARD
     Not entirely. But once we were able to conduct our research without
     interference, we made significant progress.

     DANIEL

     (realizing)
     Research on humans...because our physiology is similar to what yours
     used to be.

     ASGARD

     (impressed)
     Precisely.

     DANIEL
     I take that back, I have met an Asgard like you before. His name was
     Loki. And he was experimenting on humans too, until he was caught
     and brought to justice by the Asgard High Council.

     ASGARD
     Because they did not believe the ends justified the means.

     DANIEL
     That's right.

     ASGARD
     And look where it got them.

   [Daniel appears shocked by the coldness of the reasoning.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Traveler ship flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP ENGINEERING

   [Sheppard enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well how's it coming?

     ZELENKA
     Well, uh...

   [A fire starts on a panel next to Mila. Zelenka and Sheppard look
   worried, but Mila stamps it out with her bare hands.]

     MILA

     (dismissively)
     It does that sometimes. Don't let it bother you.

   [Zelenka guides Sheppard away from Mila so they can speak privately.]

     ZELENKA
     Listen, what we are doing here is not safe.

     SHEPPARD
     What else is new?

     ZELENKA
     She is pushing the ship well past its boundaries.

     SHEPPARD
     That's kind of what we asked for, no? If we don't get Rodney and
     Daniel back before Todd gets there, they're goners!

     ZELENKA
     This is the crudest hyperdrive system I have ever encountered. It is
     cobbled together from mismatching components.

     SHEPPARD
     She's got to be pretty smart to put a hyperdrive together with
     mismatched parts.

     ZELENKA
     She's going to burn it up. Once we drop out hyperspace, there's a
     high possibility we won't be able to engage the drive again.

     SHEPPARD

     (dismissively)
     Let's worry about that when we get there?

   [An alarm starts to emit a high pitched rapid beeping.]

     ZELENKA
     What was that? What?

   [Mila reaches over and shuts off the alarm.]

     MILA

     (unconcerned)
     Just a radiation warning. The detector's a little oversensitive. I
     wouldn't worry about it.

   [Zelenka looks to Sheppard expectantly. Sheppard winces.]

     SHEPPARD
     I've gotta get back to the bridge. I'll leave you to it.

   [He leaves Zelenka muttering under his breath.]

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CONTROL ROOM

     ASGARD
     We came to this galaxy during the war. With both the Wraith and the
     Ancients occupied, we were free to conduct our experiments.
     Unfortunately, the hostilities came to an end sooner than we
     thought, and with an unexpected result.

     DANIEL

     (shrewdly)
     You were betting on the Ancients. They may have tried to shut you
     down, but at least they wouldn't...exterminate you.

     ASGARD
     The Wraith do not tolerate the presence of advanced technologies
     other than their own. Before we knew what was happening, we were
     under attack. We lost our intergalactic ships in the first battle,
     and we did not have the resources to build more.

     DANIEL
     So how did you survive?

     ASGARD
     We had no choice but to abandon our settlements and retreat to a
     place where the Wraith could not look for us--a planet with a toxic
     atmosphere.

     DANIEL
     Oh. That...sounds nice...

     ASGARD
     It was tolerable at first. We were able to survive using simple
     breathing apparatus. But over the eons, the environment has grown so
     harsh that not even our armored exoskeletons can protect us now.

     DANIEL
     So you ventured back into the galaxy, and that's...when you came
     across this place.

     ASGARD
     We knew it was built by the Ancients, and why. But we were unable to
     activate it...until you came along.

     DANIEL
     Look, I-I'm sorry....that you were trapped on a poisonous planet for
     the last ten thousand years. I really am. I'm sure it was awful. But
     that doesn't justify what you're doing.

     ASGARD
     My people are dying. The fact that, as you tell us, our brothers are
     already gone, only reinforces the need. If we do not do this, our
     whole civilization, a hundred thousand years of history, will be
     wiped out forever. I cannot allow that to happen.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Guards frogmarch Keller onto the bridge.]

     TODD
     Doctor Keller? You're the saboteur?

     KELLER

     (stiffly)
     That's right.

     TODD
     Where is your weapon?

     KELLER

     (stammering)
     My weapon?

     TODD
     Yes. The one you used to destroy the crystal trays.

     KELLER
     I ditched it. You really think I'd want it ending up in your hands?

     TODD
     Ah, it's foolish of you to see me as the enemy.

     KELLER
     Really? Why is that?

     TODD
     I'm on a mission from your..."Colonel Sheppard."

     KELLER
     I seriously doubt that.

     TODD

     (sighing)
     It is a long story, but he has requested that we...neutralize a very
     dangerous target.

     KELLER
     Then why did you take over the ship? Why'd you attack our crew?

     TODD
     As I said, it is a long story. The mission, however, is time
     sensitive, and you have handed us a major setback. Hyperdrive,
     weapons, shields--they are all down.

     KELLER

     (unsympathetic)
     That's a real shame.

   [Todd menaces closer.]

     TODD
     It is. Considering that hundreds of thousands of humans could die
     because of it. I would think that will weigh heavily on you in the
     future.

     KELLER
     What are you talking about?

   [Todd studies her. Kenny, sitting at one of the consoles looks up.]

     KENNY
     Hyperdrive's coming back up!

     TODD
     And weapons?

     KENNY
     Irreparably damaged. They're no good to us anymore.

   [Todd tempers his frustration.]

     KELLER
     I guess you won't be able to finish the mission, then.

     TODD

     (thoughtfully)
     Oh...we'll find a way.
     (to Kenny)
     Get us back into hyperspace...and get her down with the others.

   [The soldier Wraith drag Keller away.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus enters hyperspace.]

   INT--ANCIENT SEALED ROOM

   [An alien manhandles Daniel into the room, tossing him onto the floor,
   before resealing the room.]

     MCKAY

     (stunned)
     You okay? I thought you were a goner!

   [Daniel gets up, putting his fallen glasses back onto his face.]

     DANIEL
     I'm all right.

     MCKAY
     I mean, they need me. You're kinda expendable. I just figured that--

     DANIEL

     (interrupting)
     Yeah, I-I got what you meant by "goner", thank you.

     MCKAY
     Well, what did they want?

   [Daniel sighs and adjusts his rumpled clothing.]

     DANIEL
     Uh, to talk, actually.

     MCKAY
     Oh. How'd that go?

     DANIEL
     They're Asgard.

     MCKAY

     (stunned)
     For real?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, a faction that broke off from the guys we knew thousands of
     years ago. They're...the ones inside the suits.

     MCKAY
     I did not see that one coming.

     DANIEL
     Apparently no fans of the Wraith, either.

     MCKAY
     Okay, are they going to shut off the device?

     DANIEL
     Um...no.

     MCKAY
     Then I don't care. I mean, as long as that thing is on, then
     millions of people could die. Besides, I think I've figured a way
     out of here.

     DANIEL

     (brightening)
     Really?

   [Daniel follows McKay over to one of the wall panels.]

     MCKAY
     This is an Ancient facility, and Rodney McKay knows a thing or two
     about Ancient facilities.

   [Daniel leans against the wall as McKay pries open the panel.]

     DANIEL

     (drily)
     You know, it has been clinically proven that referring to yourself
     in the third person is a sign of mental instability, right?

     MCKAY
     Eh, mentally unstable like a fox! Okay, so here's the plan. I blow
     the fire-monitoring fuse. The system suddenly goes dead. It assumes
     there could be a fire, detects life signs inside the room, it
     unlocks the doors for safety.

   [McKay short circuits some wires. Sparks fly. Daniel leans away from
   the sparks.]

     MCKAY
     And...ach!

   [The door opens.]

     DANIEL
     Good job.

     MCKAY

     (pleased)
     Huh. It's a good thing they brought you back when they did, because,
     you know, I just assumed you were dead, and I was going to leave.

     DANIEL
     Lucky me.

     MCKAY
     Yeah. You're welcome.

     DANIEL
     So...what do we do now?

     MCKAY
     We've got to shut down the device.

     DANIEL
     How do we do that?

     MCKAY

     (stammering)
     We'll just...we'll improvise.

   [McKay heads out.]

     DANIEL

     (enthusiastic)
     Right.

   [Daniel follows.]

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

   [Wraith soldiers lead Keller down the hall. Ronon swings down from
   where he's hanging from a beam on the ceiling, firing his blaster and
   downing both guards. He drops to the floor. Keller stares in shock, but
   grabs the rifle he offers to her. She shoots blindly at approaching
   guards, downing two. Ronon shoots others. The way is clear.]

     RONON
     Todd didn't kill you.

     KELLER

     (shaken)
     No, but you almost got me killed. I've never fired one of these
     outside of the range before.

     RONON
     You did great.

   [He leads the way down the corridor. They reach the door to the hangar
   bay and open it. The Daedalus crew and Woolsey are inside.]

     WOOLSEY
     Ronon, good work.

     RONON
     It's not over yet. There's an armory down the hall. We need everyone
     we can. We're taking this ship back.

   INT--ANCIENT LAB CORRIDOR

   [McKay and Daniel wander down the hallway.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, we need to get the device control room.

     DANIEL
     It'll be crawling with soldiers.

     MCKAY
     Well, then, we need to create a diversion.

     DANIEL
     I'm all ears.

     MCKAY
     Okay, uh, we go to the, uh, power relay station; we create a massive
     explosion.

     DANIEL
     I never got how that made a good diversion.

     MCKAY
     What?

     DANIEL
     You want to clear the device control room of bad guys, right?

     MCKAY
     Yes.

     DANIEL
     So, why would you assume if there was a massive explosion, people
     would go running towards it.

     MCKAY
     Well, I would.

     DANIEL
     I rest my case.

     MCKAY
     Oh, I'm sorry. You know, I'm a good person. I would want to save
     people from the fire, maybe figure out what was going on?

     DANIEL
     Well, I, au contraire, would order more guards to protect the one
     room I thought whoever was blowing things up probably wants to get
     to.

   [Daniel continues moving while McKay stops to consider this. He quickly
   follows.]

     MCKAY
     Explosion diversions are the very cornerstones of diversions.

     DANIEL
     You don't have any better ideas.

     MCKAY
     I don't have any better ideas, yes.

   [They reach a dead end of the corridor. A door opens up with two alien
   suits in the doorway. McKay and Daniel freeze. McKay raises his hands.]

     MCKAY
     Oh my god, please don't kill me. You need me!

     DANIEL
     Rodney...?

     MCKAY
     Us, us. You need us. Look, the device needs constant care. I mean,
     uh, true, I'm the only one that knows how to work it, but uh...what
     am I talking about killing for? You're not a violent race. I mean,
     you-you may have stunned us...

   [While McKay babbles, Daniel studies the suits, realizing there is no
   movement and it appears to be a closet.]

     DANIEL
     Rodney!

     MCKAY

     (continuing)
     ...more than we would've liked. But who's to say we didn't deserve
     it, right?

     DANIEL

     (sighing)
     They're just suits.

     MCKAY
     Yes, suits--suits that house one of the smartest races that ever
     evolved! I mean, the Asgard! I've always been a big fan of the
     Asgards. Some of my best friends are Asgards--

     DANIEL

     (talking insistently over McKay)
     They're empty suits!

   [He waves his hand in front of the helmets.]

     DANIEL
     See?

     MCKAY

     (abashed)
     Yeah. I know. I was, uh...

     DANIEL
     You were?

     MCKAY

     (sheepish)
     Yeah, it's not important.

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     You know, from what I could tell, the inside of the suits form
     around whoever's in them.

     MCKAY
     One size fits all...

   [They share inspired looks and move closer.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

   [Sheppard sits in the pilot's chair. Katana adjusts her radio and
   settles in the commander's chair.]

     KATANA
     You sure you have all that figured out?

     SHEPPARD
     You know, I've flown birds a lot harder to manage than this one. I'm
     surprised Larrin didn't say anything.

   [Katana shoots him a shrewd look.]

     KATANA
     Larrin's never brought you up before today.

     SHEPPARD
     Really? Never, huh?

     KATANA

     (smirking)
     Nope.

   [Sheppard appears nonplussed by this news.]

     KATANA

     (loudly)
     We're about to come out of hyperspace. Everyone, get ready.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Travelers' ship drops out of hyperspace and heads toward the
   planet with the Ancient facility.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP ENGINEERING

   [Sparks fly through the room. Zelenka and Mila peek around a corner.]

     ZELENKA
     See! I knew this would happen. We burned it out.

     MILA

     (shrugging)
     We got here though, didn't we?

   [She moves to make repairs.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD
     Any sign of the Daedalus?

     KATANA
     No. Looks like we beat them.

     SHEPPARD
     That's the first good news I've had all day.

     KATANA
     Wait...I've got two ships closing in. Shields up. Fire at will.
     Evasive maneuvers might be good.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm on it.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The two rogue Asgard ships engage the Travelers' vessel in a
   firefight. It loops around and returns fire.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Ronon throws a flash-bang into the room. After it explodes, Ronon and
   a team of the crew enter with weapons drawn. There are no Wraith
   there.]

     RONON
     Clear.

   [Woolsey, Keller, Marks, and other crew lower their own weapons and
   enter.]

     RONON
     How come we haven't run into any of them yet?

     KELLER
     I've got a bad feeling about this.

     WOOLSEY

     (to Marks)
     Do a life signs scan. Find out where they are.

   [Marks complies. His schematic shows a large grouping inside the Wraith
   ship parked in the 302 bay.]

     MARKS
     I have a mass of life-signs in the second 302 bay.

     RONON
     They fell back to the their ship. It's still in the bay.

     WOOLSEY
     Why would they do that?

     KELLER
     They saw we'd armed up? Didn't want to risk a fight?

     RONON
     That doesn't sound like Todd. I'm going to check it out.

   [He heads out.]

     WOOLSEY
     Take us out of hyperspace.

   [Marks types some commands. A menu announcement flashes on the monitor
   reading "Access Denied" and beeps.]

     WOOLSEY
     What is it?

     MARKS
     They locked us out of flight controls.

     WOOLSEY

     (concerned)
     Can you get us back in?

     MARKS
     Not quickly.

     KELLER

     (worried)
     What's he got planned?

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CONTROL ROOM

   [Daniel and McKay, both wearing full alien armor, enter and shoot the
   three armored Asgards in the room. The pair take off their helmets.]

     DANIEL
     Okay, how long to get the device shut down?

     MCKAY
     Five minutes.

   [They move to the console.]

     MCKAY
     All right, you look watch the...aw, come on!

     DANIEL
     What? What now?

     MCKAY
     Well, something must have spooked them.

     DANIEL
     Why?

     MCKAY
     Well, aside from encrypting access to this workstation...?

     DANIEL

     (dismissive)
     Yeah, but you can break that.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, in a heartbeat. But as they very well know, you can't operate
     this machine without the control key. Look, the thing they stole
     from Janus's lab to begin with...

     DANIEL

     (looking around, sighing)
     They've taken it.

   EXT--ANCIENT LAB FACILITY

   [The third Asgard ship lifts off from the facility's docking bay.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Travelers' ship and rogue Asgard ship continue to engage in close
   quarters battle, rotating around each other and firing belly-to-belly.
   Finally the Asgard vessel is destroyed.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD
     One down, one to go.

     KATANA
     I'm picking up a third ship headed right for us.

     SHEPPARD

     (sarcastic)
     Wonderful.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Traveler ship heads towards the third vessel, firing. The other
   ship returns fire, then opens up a hyperspace window between the two
   vessels and flies into it just before the Traveler ship reaches it.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

   [Sparks continue to fly on the bridge from damage.]

     KATANA

     (breathless)
     That was close. It flew into hyperspace.

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     KATANA
     Hold on...I've got another window opening.

     SHEPPARD
     They're coming right back at us! What kind of messed up battle
     technique is that?

     KATANA
     It's quite a bit out, nowhere near the planet yet. Wait...it's the
     Daedalus!

     SHEPPARD
     Contact them! We're gonna need the help.

   [Woolsey and the Daedalus bridge crew appear on the video screen.]

     WOOLSEY

     (on vidcom)
     Colonel Sheppard?

     SHEPPARD
     Surprised to see all you guys.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The conversation continues between both ships' bridges.]

     WOOLSEY
     Same here.

     SHEPPARD

     Look, I'm on a Trav--
     (sparks interrupt him)
     I'm on a Travelers' ship. We've engaged the enemy. Have you gotten
     the Daedalus back? Because we're gonna need the help.

     WOOLSEY
     Todd let us take her back without so much as a fight. But he's
     locked us out of the controls and retreated to one of the 302 bays.

     SHEPPARD
     Why the hell would he do that? He needs that place destroyed more
     than anyone.

   [An alarm beeps on Marks's console.]

     MARKS
     Mister Woolsey, sir?

     WOOLSEY
     What is it, Marks?

     MARKS
     Sir, the second we came out of hyperspace, a preprogrammed
     subroutine kicked in.

     WOOLSEY
     Meaning?

     MARKS
     Our main scanners located a facility on the planet and immediately
     locked the guidance system into it.

     WOOLSEY
     It's taking us to the Attero device.

     MARKS
     In a way...Sir, it's programmed a collision course.

   [Woolsey and Keller exchange worried looks.]

     KELLER
     That's how he's going to destroy the facility...by ramming us into
     it.

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CONTROL ROOM

     DANIEL
     Can't we just power down the entire facility?

     MCKAY
     We can't do much more than turn the lights off and on without the
     component thing.

     DANIEL
     Well, we have to do something.

     MCKAY

     (inspired)
     Wait a second...these suits were designed to protect the wearer from
     harsh environments, right?

     DANIEL
     Technically...yes.

     MCKAY
     Then I have a really terrible idea.

   [McKay looks to the shielded chamber. Daniel follows him.]

     DANIEL
     Oh, no. No. You're not thinking what I think you're thinking. The
     radiation in there would be pretty extreme.

     MCKAY
     Not to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly,
     but...Yeah, the antenna has a control crystal. If we can pull it
     manually...

     DANIEL
     I'd say fifty-fifty we even get that far.

     MCKAY
     I'd go thirty-seventy. But I don't have a better idea, and the
     suits...they should protect us.

   [Daniel sighs.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KELLER
     We disabled the ship weapons.

     WOOLSEY
     You did?

     KELLER
     Well, Ronon did, yeah. They didn't have any other choice. Ramming
     the facility with the ship is the only sure-fire way to take it out.

     WOOLSEY
     Killing all of us in the process.

     KELLER
     I don't think that he's that worried about us.

     MARKS
     They just depressurized the 302 bay.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Todd's ship launches out of the fighter bay and flies away. Daedalus
   continues its course to the planet.]

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CONTROL ROOM

     MCKAY
     You ready?

     DANIEL
     Let's just get this over with.

   [They don their helmets.]

     MCKAY
     You know, we both don't have to go in there.

     DANIEL
     Well, when you get killed by one of those discharges, someone's
     going to have to finish the job, so...

   [He shrugs.]

     MCKAY

     (drily)
     Oh. Great pep talk. Thanks.

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE SHIELDED CHAMBER

   [The door to the chamber opens and McKay and Daniel step inside. McKay
   points to the lightening arcs flying randomly through the room.]

     MCKAY
     I'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.

     DANIEL

     (nodding)
     Thanks, coach.

   [From the inside of the helmet, Daniel can see the room through the
   visor as well as get read-outs on several items via a overlay display,
   including McKay's presence. They reach the device itself. McKay
   crouches and pulls open the panel underneath the device. He pauses,
   studying the crystals.]

     DANIEL
     What are you waiting for?

   [McKay studies his readouts of the crystals in his own helmet.]

     MCKAY
     I have to pull the right one, or the antenna explodes.

     DANIEL

     (with nervous impatience)
     Well, hurry up.

   [Daniel moves closer to the device, using its pillar as a lightening
   rod to deflect the arcs from being attracted to him.]

     DANIEL
     But get it right.

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD
     How long before the Daedalus hits the surface?

     KATANA
     A minute, tops. How many people on board?

     SHEPPARD
     A couple hundred. Look, I've got an idea, but you're gonna have to
     trust me.

     KATANA
     All right.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Zelenka, Mila, I need you to open up the hyperdrive in thirty
     seconds. We're going to have to make a short jump.

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP ENGINEERING

     ZELENKA
     Impossible.

     MILA
     Not a problem.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KELLER
     You can do this, Marks.

     WOOLSEY
     We're all counting on you.

     MARKS

     (nervously)
     I've almost got it.

   [The ship starts to shake and rumble. Keller looks out the
   view-screen.]

     KELLER
     We're entering the atmosphere.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The ship's hull heats up immensely and pieces break off the ship as
   the unshielded vessel heads through the atmosphere bow first.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KELLER

     (worried)
     Marks...?

   EXT--PLANET ATMOSPHERE

   [The ship continues to break apart as it passes through he atmosphere.
   It flies through the sky, heading towards the bright light of the
   Attero device-lit facility. The Traveler ship flies in front of
   Daedalus and opens a hyperspace window. Both ships enter it.]

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CHAMBER

     MCKAY

     (licking his lips)
     Okay...here goes nothing.

   [McKay reaches for the right crystal. A lightning arc feeds back from
   the pillar and strikes Daniel, attracting more discharges to him. He's
   thrown off his feet and onto the floor.]

     MCKAY
     Daniel!

   [McKay pulls the crystal, powering down the machine. He turns towards
   the writhing Daniel.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The two ships exit hyperspace on the other side of the planet, a few
   loose pieces of Daedalus following them.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     WOOLSEY
     What just happened?

     SHEPPARD

     (over vidcom)
     You're welcome?

     WOOLSEY
     What did you do?

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD
     I just opened up a hyperspace window big enough for the both of us.
     We just traveled through the planet.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Keller and Woolsey sigh in relief. Marks's console makes a hum.]

     MARKS

     (breathless)
     I got it! I'm back in. We've got control of the ship.

     WOOLSEY
     And not a moment...too late.

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     KATANA
     They found us again.

     SHEPPARD
     Give them everything you got.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Traveler ship engages in battle with the rogue Asgard vessel,
   destroying it.]

   INT--ATTERO DEVICE CHAMBER

   [McKay removes his helmet.]

     MCKAY
     Okay. You're okay. You're okay.

   [He helps Daniel remove his own helmet. Daniel groans in pain.]

     DANIEL

     (groaning)
     Ow! Wrong again. Did you turn it off?

     MCKAY
     I did...uh, we did...you did. Look, where does it hurt?

     DANIEL

     (panting in pain)
     Everywhere. Uh...I don't suppose there's a hospital nearby.

     MCKAY

     (forlorn)
     I'm-I'm pretty sure we're on our own.

     DANIEL
     Good.

     MCKAY
     Look, I mean, on the bright side, I mean, we're both gonna be dead
     of dehydration in like, five days, so you won't have to put up with
     me for much longer.

   [Daniel gives a pained smile, his eyes glistening. It is more difficult
   for him to speak through the agony.]

     DANIEL
     I'm, uh...I'm, uh, pretty busted up, Rodney. I don't...I don't think
     I'm going to make it that long.

     MCKAY

     (emotional)
     Okay, um, I know it may not seem like it, but...I want you to know,
     I-I-I really res--

   [The pair are beamed away.]

   INT--DAEDALUS INFIRMARY

   [Keller and staff are in the infirmary. McKay and Daniel are beamed
   there. McKay looks around.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, thank god!

   [Keller shoots him a worried but relieved look.]

     KELLER
     I sure am glad to see you two.

     MCKAY
     He's badly hurt.

   [McKay moves out of the way of the staff, who with Keller begin to work
   on Daniel, helping get him on a bed. Woolsey approaches McKay.]

     WOOLSEY
     That's a new look for you.

     MCKAY
     Well, you know me. It's function over fashion.

     WOOLSEY
     Is the device still active?

   [McKay proudly holds up the crystal still in his hand.]

     MCKAY
     Not without this. It's the facility's main control crystal.

     WOOLSEY
     That's not good enough for me.

   [McKay's smile falters as Woolsey keys his radio.]

     WOOLSEY
     Colonel Sheppard, we have Doctors McKay and Jackson. Our weapons are
     not operational. Can you please see to it that we never have to deal
     with the Attero device again?

   [McKay looks confused.]

     KATANA

     (over radio)
     I'm locked onto its coordinates.

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD
     Opening fire.

   EXT--ANCIENT FACILITY

   [Weapons blasts shoot through the sky and strike the facility,
   destroying it completely.]

   INT--TRAVELER SHIP BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Leveled.

   INT--DAEDALUS INFIRMARY

     WOOLSEY

     (smiling, into radio)
     Good.
     (to McKay)
     Let's go home.

     MCKAY
     Well, you wanna...unzip me?

   [He gestures to his suit.]

     WOOLSEY

     (drily)
     I'll look for a can opener.

   [He walks away leaving a flustered McKay standing there.]

     MCKAY
     Well...

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Katana and Sheppard walk through a corridor.]

     KATANA
     Zelenka has been a big help with ship repairs. We should have her
     ready to fly in no time.

     SHEPPARD
     And then what?

     KATANA
     Start a new settlement, I guess?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's good to hear. You tell Larrin I'll help you with
     whatever you need.

     KATANA

     (smiling)
     Thank you. We'll be in touch.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I'm sure you will be. Tell Larrin she doesn't need to wait for
     the next galactic emergency to drop by? I'm a lot more charming when
     my friends aren't about to die.

     KATANA

     (grinning)
     That's not what Larrin said.

     SHEPPARD
     See! She does talk about me!

     KATANA

     (conceding)
     Every now and again.

     SHEPPARD
     What does she say?

   [Katana purses her lips and stays mum.]

     SHEPPARD
     What, not even a hint?

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, NEAR INFIRMARY

   [Ronon intercepts Keller heading away from the infirmary.]

     RONON
     Hey.

     KELLER
     Hey.

     RONON
     You all done for the day?

     KELLER
     Uh, Doctor Cole's taking my shift. Yeah.

     RONON
     Wanna get somethin' to eat?

     KELLER

     (sighing and stammering)
     Um, listen, um, uh, I-I'm really glad you came on the mission. I
     mean, without you there, we'd probably all be dead.

   [She chuckles half-heartedly. Ronon smiles.]

     KELLER

     But...uh...I just want to be clear, because, um...
     (she sighs and shakes her head)
     I just want you to know, that, uh, I'm kind of...interested in
     somebody else.

     RONON
     So?

     KELLER

     (bemused)
     I just...didn't want you to get the wrong imp--

   [Ronon shifts, frowning.]

     RONON

     (interrupting)
     You didn't. I just, um, I wanted to get something to eat.

     KELLER
     Okay...because I thought...?

     RONON
     Yeah, well, you're wrong.

   [Keller stares at him confused. Ronon keeps her gaze with a mild
   expression.]

     KELLER
     Okay.

     RONON
     Okay.

     KELLER

     (smiling, embarrassed)
     Do you still want to go--

     RONON
     Uh, no. I should-should probably...

   [Keller's smile falters. There is an awkward silence.]

     RONON

     (low voice)
     I should go.

   [Ronon walks away.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Daniel lies in a bed, wearing hospital scrubs. He has a tray of food
   on his lap and his grimacing at the fruit cup he's attempting to eat.
   McKay arrives.]

     MCKAY
     Hey.

     DANIEL
     Hmm.

     MCKAY
     How are ya?

     DANIEL

     (wincing)
     Well, it hurts to eat this fruit cup.

     MCKAY
     So don't eat the fruit cup, then.

     DANIEL
     Thank you, Groucho.

   [He sets the fruit cup aside.]

     DANIEL
     Listen, not that I don't appreciate the visits, but shouldn't you be
     trying to figure out a way to keep the Asgards out of the shield
     again?

     MCKAY
     One step ahead of you. It's not going to happen again.

     DANIEL

     (pleased)
     Oh! Good.

     MCKAY
     You don't think they'd-they'd make a run at us again?

     DANIEL

     (sighing, considering)
     Well, I'm not sure, but we did ruin the one plan they had to feel
     free in this galaxy. They might hold a grudge.

     MCKAY
     Well, let's...hope not.

     DANIEL

     (disappointed)
     I don't think I'll be around to find out, though.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I heard. They're, um, sending you back to Earth.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, I guess I need some major patching up and recovery, and Landry
     prefers that I do that there instead of here, so...

     MCKAY
     Well, the Daedalus has already picked up a 'gate, uh, leftover from
     the old Gate Bridge, and, uh, my team is installing it as we speak,
     so we should have you home in, uh, no time at all.

     DANIEL
     That's good. That is...good.

     MCKAY
     Yes. So...

   [There is an awkward silence, only broken by McKay making distracted
   popping sounds with his mouth.]

     MCKAY
     Well, it's been, um...unique.

     DANIEL
     Yes. Yes, it has. It sure has. But, I do want to say thank you for,
     uh...saying that you respected me when you thought I was about to
     die back there.

     MCKAY

     (affronted)
     Excuse me? I said no such thing.

     DANIEL
     Yeah, you did you were like, um: "um, I know it may not seem like
     it, but...I really respect you," and that means a great...deal to
     me.

   [Daniel smiles.]

     MCKAY
     I don't believe I ever finished that sentence.

   [Daniel's smile falters.]

     DANIEL
     How else would you have finished that sentence?

     MCKAY

     (stammering)
     I would've said "regret." I would've said "I really regret you being
     here because none of this would've happened...otherwise."

   [McKay shuffles uncomfortably.]

     DANIEL

     (incredulous)
     So you can only give compliments to the dying?

     MCKAY

     (flinching)
     It's something I'm working on.

   [There is another brief, awkward silence. Daniel holds up his tray of
   food.]

     DANIEL
     Do you want to try any of this?

     MCKAY
     Ooh. Fries?

     DANIEL
     Yeah, yeah. Go--dive right in. Take the-take the deal there.

   [McKay munches on some fries. Daniel reaches to the nearby table and
   gestures for Rodney to eat as many fries as he likes.]
