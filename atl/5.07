   EXT--PLANET, NIGHT

   [Two men move through some woods, one holding a lantern to find the
   way. The other, Mirellus, is holding a basket of something.]

     MAN
     I told you we should have started back sooner.

     MIRELLUS
     Well if we left when you had said, we'd have been returning home
     empty handed.

   [The man gestures for them to stop.]

     MIRELLUS
     Why are we stopping?

     MAN
     I saw someone... Hello?

     MIRELLUS
     There's nobody there.

   [They walk forward.]

     MAN
     Hello?

   [The see someone crouched in the fog, indistinct.]

     MAN
     Are you all right, friend? Are you lost?

   [He reaches for the man, whose head twitches. They both back away and
   turn to run. Mirellus gets away, but his friend does not follow, and is
   lost in the fog. Mirellus turns away and comes face-to-face with a man
   in a gas mask.]

   ONE YEAR LATER

   INT--LAB ON PLANET

   [The all-woman team of Porter, Vega, Mehra, and Teldy explore a dark,
   wet corridor.]

     PORTER
     The signal's getting stronger.

   [Vega tosses a glow-stick on the ground to mark their path, then sees
   that it has landed beside a gas mask.]

     VEGA
     Hey, what's this?

   [She picks it up.]

     MEHRA
     It's really creepy is what it is.

     TELDY

     (from down the corridor)
     We found something.

   [Vega and Mehra join the others further down the tunnel. They see
   something.]

     TELDY
     I think we'd better contact Atlantis.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--BECKETT'S QUARTERS

   [Beckett is packing a bag of clothing.]

     MCKAY
     I can't believe you're leaving. I mean, you know, you're sick, we
     cure you, you go away for six months to recover, you finally come
     back and now, what, you're here a week, you're leaving again?

     BECKETT
     I'm sorry, Rodney, but for the time being I realize that my place
     isn't here.

     MCKAY
     What? Of course it is. What are you, kidding me?

     BECKETT
     As a doctor, I can't just sit by and do nothing while people in this
     galaxy are suffering -- especially when I know I've had a hand in
     what's happened to them.

     MCKAY
     C'mon, you cannot blame yourself, all right? Look, Michael forced
     you to help him. He was the one disseminating the drug.

     BECKETT
     Aye, and I'm the one that helped the Hoffans perfect it.

   [Sheppard arrives.]

     BECKETT
     Colonel. Just in time to give us a hand.

     SHEPPARD
     Actually, Doc, you're gonna have to delay your travel plans. Just
     got word from Major Teldy. They've found another one of Michael's
     labs.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard and Beckett walk through a heavily wooded forest with no
   clear paths.]

     BECKETT
     I wish you'd told me we'd be doing so much walking.

     SHEPPARD
     Did I forget to mention that?

     BECKETT
     Aye, you did. You also forgot to mention the fact that we'd be
     rappelling down the side of a mountain! My legs are seizing up.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's what happens when you do nothing for six months of R &
     R.

     BECKETT
     Not to mention two months in a stasis pod, thank you!

     SHEPPARD
     Two months?! Try eight hundred years! That'll give you rubber legs.

     TELDY
     Colonel!

   [Teldy and her team meet them coming the other way. Sheppard seems
   surprised by the team's make-up. He and Teldy salute each other.]

     SHEPPARD

     (introducing Beckett)
     Major Teldy, Doctor Beckett. Doctor Beckett, Major.

     TELDY
     This is Sergeant Mehra, Doctor Porter, and of course you've already
     met Captain Vega.

     SHEPPARD
     I didn't realize you, uh...

     TELDY
     That my team was a bunch of girls, sir?

     SHEPPARD
     That's not what I was gonna say.

     BECKETT
     No!

     SHEPPARD
     But, you know, now that you mention it ...

     TELDY
     Well, I was told to pick the best and the brightest. Funny how that
     worked out.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Funny.

     TELDY
     Shall we?

   [Sheppard nods. He and Beckett are awkward.]

     BECKETT
     Aye. Yes.

   [The team turns around back the way they had come. Beckett and Sheppard
   fist-bump each other.]

   INT--CATACOMBS NEAR LAB

   [They all enter the corridor leading to Michael's lab.]

     PORTER
     We were passing through the area when we picked up a low level
     energy signature. We were able to triangulate and get a lock on the
     signal and then follow it down into these catacombs. It's a bit of a
     walk.

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [They arrive sometime later. The room has Wraith-type computer
   terminals and stasis pods. Everything is in a state of disrepair.]

     PORTER
     The signal finally led us to this.

     BECKETT
     Stasis pods. I spent some time in a number of Michael's labs when I
     was his prisoner, but this is one I'm not familiar with.

     TELDY
     Well, looks like the cleaning crew hasn't been around in a while.

   [Mehra taps on the door of a chamber.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey, Sarge!

     MEHRA
     Sorry, Colonel.

     SHEPPARD
     And can we hold off touching stuff here? Last thing I need is
     another three tons of rubble falling on my head, all right?

     PORTER
     It's all right. I've disabled the security protocols.

     SHEPPARD
     You can do that?

     PORTER
     Oh, yeah.

     SHEPPARD
     Why the hell didn't McKay think of that?

     PORTER
     There was no way for him to have known. But thanks to the
     information that he gathered from that experience, I'm able to
     bypass the security protocols this time.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, what've you got?

     BECKETT
     Well, data related to Michael's experiments in this lab. This could
     prove to be very valuable.

     PORTER
     Going through all of this information may take a while, though.

     BECKETT
     Oh, aye.

     VEGA
     Maybe we should go check out the village.

     SHEPPARD
     What village?

     TELDY
     We spotted it this morning. It's just a few clicks south of here.

     VEGA
     The locals might have some information.

     SHEPPARD

     I guess that beats sittin' around here watching these guys read.
     (to Mehra)
     Sergeant, you're with them. Make sure they don't geek out too much,
     all right?

   [Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega leave, leaving Mehra to watch Beckett and
   Porter. Beckett and Porter look at a computer terminal.]

     BECKETT
     Nice work, Doctor.

     PORTER
     Thank you.

     BECKETT
     Very nice.

   [He looks at Mehra, who turns away as if put off by the flirtation
   going on.]

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega head toward the village.]

     VEGA
     You know what I'd love right about now?

     SHEPPARD
     Let me guess... a beer.

     VEGA
     A puddle pumper.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that could've been arranged had I known we'd be walking for so
     long.

     TELDY
     Yeah, well, the area's too heavily forested. There's nowhere to
     land. Besides, this is good exercise. Firms up your glutes and
     calves.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, great. Couple more hours of this and I can skip my cardio funk
     workout.

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Mehra takes a bit from a power bar while Beckett and Porter work at
   the computer. Mehra idly taps on a chamber door, the silhouette of a
   human-shaped being visible behind it.]

     MEHRA
     They alive?

     BECKETT
     They're in stasis. Their physical and chemical processes have been
     suspended but, yes, they're alive.

     MEHRA
     So, can you wake 'em up?

     BECKETT
     Well, without the proper understanding of their respective
     conditions, I'm afraid that might kill them.

     MEHRA
     Hmm. Just gonna keep them on ice until you figure something out,
     huh? Well, I guess it doesn't matter to them, or their families
     who've probably written them off. But, boy, that would make for one
     hell of a reunion, huh?

   [Beckett looks uncomfortable, and Porter clears her throat while
   staring pointedly at Mehra.]

     MEHRA
     I think I'm going to check the perimeter. Holler if you need me.

   [She walks out.]

     PORTER

     (to Beckett)
     I'm sorry.

     BECKETT

     You have no need to apologize, and frankly, neither does she. She's
     right.
     Resurrections make for very interesting reunions, especially when
     the dead man had no idea he was dead to begin with. I'm sorry. How
     about you, Doctor Porter?

     PORTER
     Oh, Alison.

     BECKETT
     Alison. Any interesting experiences you'd like to share? Encountered
     any dangerous predators? Been cloned lately?

     PORTER
     No. But in all fairness, I am new to the Pegasus galaxy, and I hear
     that cloning is more of a second-year thing.

     BECKETT
     Third, actually.

     PORTER

     (smiling)
     Oh.

     BECKETT
     Oh.

   [His laptop, connected to the Wraith terminal, beeps.]

     BECKETT
     Hang on.

     PORTER
     What is it?

     BECKETT
     It appears to be Michael's earliest version of a human-iratus
     hybrid.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [The rustic village appears deserted and overgrown. Sheppard, Teldy,
   and Vega walk slowly through.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hello? Anyone here? All right. Let's split up, take a look around.
     Maintain radio contact.

     VEGA
     Yes, sir.

   [The move off.]

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

   [Vega enters alone and shines her flashlight around the room.]

   INT--VILLAGE CORRIDOR

   [Teldy explores the area.]

   EXT--VILLAGE STREET

   [Sheppard comes out of a building.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Vega, you got anything?

     VEGA

     (over radio)
     Nothing on this end. Uh, it looks like the locals cleared out a
     while ago.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. The question is why?

   [Someone is watching Sheppard as he walks away.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Beckett works on his laptop.]

     BECKETT
     Incredible. According to this, these earliest test subjects weren't
     technically human-iratus hybrids. They're a combination of several
     other life forms.

     PORTER
     Maybe that's why he discontinued this line of research. It proved
     overly ambitious.

     BECKETT
     Well, no. According to this, the experiment was a success.

     PORTER
     So what does that mean?

     BECKETT
     Well, it means there's nothing we could do for them, because these
     things in here... aren't people any more.

   [While they look into a stasis pod, Mehra comes up behind them.]

     MEHRA
     Hey!

   [The startle and turn around, sighing in relief.]

     MEHRA
     Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Just wanted to let you know
     it's gonna get dark soon, so are we gonna make this thing an
     all-nighter or...?

     BECKETT
     No, Sergeant.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Something watches Sheppard walk by a doorway. It follows Sheppard out
   onto the street, to find Sheppard sitting on some stairs and looking
   back, his P-90 ready.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey.

   [The "something" is Mirellus. Teldy and Vega approach from behind him.]

     VEGA
     Easy.

     MIRELLUS
     Who are you? Where do you come from?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we came through that big round thing. We're explorers. Who are
     you?

     MIRELLUS
     My name is Mirellus.

     TELDY
     Well, Mirellus, why don't you tell us what happened here? Where is
     everyone?

     MIRELLUS
     Gone.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     MIRELLUS
     It began about a year and a half ago. Locals started disappearing.
     From the surrounding forest at first and then from within the
     village itself. Day, night -- they vanished without a trace. There
     was no reason for what was happening. No explanation except one:
     this village was cursed. And so we abandoned it.

     SHEPPARD
     Then why are you still here?

     MIRELLUS
     I now live in the next village. I spotted you exiting the caves, and
     I followed you to find out what you were doing here and, if
     necessary, to warn you.

     SHEPPARD

     (standing and approaching)
     Well, what can you tell us about those caves?

     MIRELLUS
     They are also rumored to be a dangerous place... although the fact
     that you survived the visit would suggest otherwise. What did you
     find there?

     BECKETT

     (over radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, do you copy?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Don't tell me you're already done, Beckett.

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     Oh no, far from it. We've downloaded some information into the
     tablets. We'd like to go over it this evening. Ideally, we'd like to
     stick around, possibly bed down in the village if there's room for
     us.

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Ah, well, I think there's a little room here, yeah.

     BECKETT

     (over radio)
     Great, we'll head your way then.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Mirellus)
     Sorry about that.

     MIRELLUS
     I wish you luck if you're planning to stay.

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa. We're not finished with this conversation.

     MIRELLUS
     Night is falling, and this isn't a safe place. I must go.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, suit yourself.

   [Mirellus leaves.]

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Night is falling. Beckett, Mehra, and Porter head toward the village.]

     BECKETT
     So, Sergeant, I hear you served with Stargate Command before
     transferring over.

     MEHRA
     Yeah, but Pegasus had more of what I was looking for.

     BECKETT
     And what was that?

     MEHRA
     Bad guys who need killin'.

     BECKETT
     Oh!

     MEHRA
     The Milky Way just hasn't been the same since the Ori got their
     butts kicked.

     BECKETT
     Well, some would argue that the situation's actually improved--

   [Mehra signals for them to stop.]

     BECKETT
     What is it?

     MEHRA
     Thought I heard something.

     BECKETT
     What?

   [She scans the area.]

     MEHRA
     It's probably nothing.

   [The move out.]

     BECKETT

     (to Porter, on edge)
     Geez.

   [Something is watching them from the forrest and comes out of cover
   after they leave.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

   [Everyone has gathered.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, we're going over to the next village to talk to some
     locals. You guys need anything, want anything?

     PORTER
     Yeah. If you happen to pass a Starbucks, I'll take a grande triple
     sugar free vanilla latte.

     SHEPPARD
     No problem! Sarge...

     MEHRA
     I'm babysitting. Yes, sir.

     SHEPPARD
     Be back in a couple of hours.

   [Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega leave.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Something moves through the corridors, stopping in front of a pod. Its
   door slides open, and green gas escapes, obscuring everything.]

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

   [Beckett and Porter work on their tablet computers. Mehra sits against
   the wall, behind them, reading "The Martian Chronicles".]

     PORTER

     (fatigued)
     Oh! I feel like I'm back in college studying for my mid-terms.

     BECKETT
     I know what you mean. Where was that, then?

     PORTER
     Cal Tech. Go Beavers!

     BECKETT
     Aye! What year did you graduate?

     PORTER
     1996.

     BECKETT
     Oh! So you're just a youngster!

     PORTER
     Oh! Thank you.

   [Mehra laughs at the scene. They turn to look at her.]

     MEHRA
     I just read something funny.

   [The turn back from her.]

     MEHRA
     And really obvious.

     BECKETT
     Anyway, what brings you here to the Pegasus galaxy?

     PORTER
     Well, you can just chalk that up to my sense of adventure. A desire
     to visit strange, unexplored worlds; meet new and interesting
     people...

   [They laugh flirtatiously.]

     MEHRA

     (annoyed)
     Okay, I'm gonna go check the perimeter. Be back in twenty... Unless
     there's a sock on the doorknob.

   [She leaves. Beckett and Porter laugh uncomfortably.]

     BECKETT
     She's a character, that one.

     PORTER
     Yeah.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, NIGHT

   [Sheppard and his team walk through woods. It is hard to see.]

     TELDY
     This fog sure rolled in quickly.

     SHEPPARD
     Vega, are you sure we're heading' in the right direction?

     VEGA
     More or less.

   [Teldy's flashlight goes out. She taps it.]

     TELDY
     Oh, dammit.

   [Sheppard's goes out.]

     SHEPPARD
     Great. Mine too.

     TELDY
     Something in the fog's messing with the lights. Makes you wonder
     what we're walking through.

     VEGA
     Or breathing.

   [Sheppard makes the signal to stop.]

     VEGA
     What's the matter?

     SHEPPARD
     I think I saw something.

     TELDY
     What?

     VEGA
     okay, I definitely saw something that time.

   [A figure rushes by. The three stand with their backs to each other,
   weapons raised.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   [Mehra strolls casually, whistling to herself. The looks over at the
   village well. She picks up a rock, climbs the steps to the well, and
   drops it in. She listens for the rock to land. The flashlight on her
   P-90 fades out. She hits it.]

     MEHRA
     Damn.

   [She looks down to see an old doll lying in the leaves that looks like
   it was fashioned after a zombie. She picks it up.]

     MEHRA
     Creepy!

   [She tosses it back to the ground and continues her patrol. Behind her,
   fog begins to rise from the well.]

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, NIGHT

     VEGA
     It's probably just some animal.

     TELDY
     Just some animal that seems to be stalking us. What a relief.

     SHEPPARD
     Quiet! I heard something.

   [Mirellus appears out of the fog, surprising them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

     TELDY
     Hey, hey, hey! Easy, Mirellus!

     SHEPPARD
     What's going on?

     MIRELLUS
     Demons!

     SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

     MIRELLUS
     They're out there in the mist.

     VEGA

     (sarcastic)
     Demons, right.

     MIRELLUS
     They're after me! All of us are in danger.

     SHEPPARD
     Take it easy.

     VEGA
     With all due respect, we're not buying any of this, are we?

     TELDY
     Stay sharp, Vega.

   [Vega takes a few steps away from them.]

     VEGA
     Well, let's get back to Atlantis before--

   [Something grabs her from behind and pulls her straight back into the
   fog. The others rush toward her.]

     TELDY
     Vega! Vega!

   [They find her lying on the forest floor. Sheppard checks her pulse.]

     SHEPPARD
     Crap.

   [Sheppard sees a figure moving in the fog. It approaches, then attacks.
   Sheppard shoots it, and it screams and falls. He and Teldy see more
   figures moving. He grab Vega's gun.]

     SHEPPARD
     Fall back!

   [Teldy, Sheppard, and Mirellus head away.]

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

     PORTER
     I'm really glad that we got this opportunity to work together,
     Carson.

     BECKETT
     So am I, Alison.

   [The hear gunfire outside.]

     PORTER
     What was that?

     BECKETT
     I don't know.

   [The rush outside. Beckett activates his radio. Mehra joins them.]

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     Colonel, is everything all right? Colonel, do you read? Colonel?
     (to others)
     I'm getting nothing on the radio.

     MEHRA
     Get back inside. I'll check it out.

     BECKETT
     I'm coming with you.

     MEHRA
     Like hell you are!

     BECKETT
     I'm not gonna let you go out there by yourself.

     MEHRA

     (insistent)
     The colonel told me to take care of you. That is exactly what I'm
     doing. You two are staying here, as far away from that gunfire as
     possible. Now, you get back inside, and you lock that door.

     BECKETT
     You can't tell me to--

     MEHRA
     That is an order.

     PORTER
     Carson, come on.

   [Carson concedes. Mehra leaves.]

     PORTER
     Come on.

   [They go back inside the building.]

   INT--CATACOMBS NEAR MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Sheppard, Mirellus, and Teldy make their way to the lab.]

     MIRELLUS
     I'm sorry. I didn't know.

     SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

   [The reach the lab.]

     TELDY
     Oh my god. The pods have been opened.

     MIRELLUS
     It was me. I released them.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     MIRELLUS
     When you asked about the caves, I knew you'd found something. I came
     to see for myself.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     MIRELLUS
     Because my wife was among the missing. When I saw the bodies sealed
     in those things, I thought that maybe... I didn't know. I thought
     that I could save her.

     SHEPPARD
     Twelve pods. That means there's twelve of those things running
     around out there.

     TELDY
     Minus the one you took out, that leaves us with eleven.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Beckett? Doctor Porter?

   [There is only static.]

     TELDY
     That must be the mist. I mean, it's messing with our flashlights;
     probably radios too.

     SHEPPARD
     How's your Wraith language skills?

     TELDY
     I'm guessing about as good as yours are.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, we need Beckett and Doctor Porter here.

     TELDY
     Let's go get 'em.

     MIRELLUS
     But the demons are still out there.

     SHEPPARD
     We'll be back for you.

   [Sheppard and Teldy head out. After a moment, Mirellus is too
   uncomfortable to stay behind.]

     MIRELLUS
     Wait!

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

   [Porter looks out through through the slats boarding the windows.]

     PORTER
     It's getting pretty foggy out there.

     BECKETT
     I shouldn't have let her go out there by herself.

     PORTER
     You were under orders.

     BECKETT
     I should have insisted.

     PORTER
     And she probably would have decked you. You don't know Dusty.

   [They hear a faint sound.]

     BECKETT
     What the hell was that?

     PORTER
     Maybe she's back.

   [Beckett opens the door.]

     BECKETT
     Sergeant? Sergeant, is that you? Dammit.

   [Beckett starts to put on his gear.]

     PORTER
     What are you doing?

     BECKETT
     I'm going out there.

     PORTER
     Dusty told us to stay inside.

     BECKETT
     Look, it's probably nothing, but just in case it's someone, I'd like
     to surprise them instead of the other way around.

     BECKETT
     Look, Alison, I'll be fine. You just stay put, okay?

   [She nods.]

     BECKETT
     All right.

   [He goes out into the fog. His flashlight fails.]

     BECKETT
     Sergeant? Sergeant Mehra?

   [He sees a creature. It is making strange clicking sounds like they
   heard earlier.]

     BECKETT
     Dear Lord!

   [He steps backward to escape, but snaps a twig. The creature hears and
   launches itself after him. Beckett runs, trips, then gets back up. He
   comes to rest against a rock. He looks all around, pointing his gun,
   panting in fear. He senses something and quiets. A creature is right
   there, trying to hear or smell him. Its eye sockets are scarred over.
   It expels some fog. Not hearing Beckett, it slithers away. Beckett's
   radio screams static in his ear. He grabs it. The creature descends on
   him again, this time to attack. Mehra shoots it from behind. Mehra
   grabs Beckett to get him up.]

     MEHRA
     Come on!

     BECKETT
     Geez, Sergeant!

     MEHRA
     Move it, move it! Go!

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

   [Mehra and Beckett rush in.]

     MEHRA
     What the hell was that?

     BECKETT
     Where's Alison?

     MEHRA
     What were those things?

     BECKETT
     Lower your voice. I think those creatures hunt by sound.

   [Sheppard, Teldy, and Mirellus burst in.]

     BECKETT
     Oh, God!

     SHEPPARD
     Judging from that, I guess you already know what's going on.

     MEHRA
     Where's the Captain?

     SHEPPARD
     She's gone.

     TELDY
     Where's Porter?

     BECKETT
     We don't know.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, that's great All we need now is for the Prom Queen and the kid
     in the wheelchair to wander off and we're all set.

     BECKETT
     We have to find her. She has no idea what's out there.

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell is out there?

     BECKETT
     Michael's experiments.

     TELDY
     Yeah, I think we figured that one out.

     BECKETT
     It's an early version of the hybrid. It's been genetically altered
     to incorporate the predatory characteristics of several other
     creatures.

     MEHRA
     What other creatures?

     BECKETT
     I'm not sure. All I know for certain is that they're blind and they
     hunt by sound. And that fog out there is not a natural weather
     phenomenon. I saw one of them exude the mist from the gills on its
     neck.

     TELDY
     What, like a squid releasing its ink?

     BECKETT
     Except that's a defensive mechanism. These creatures clearly use the
     fog as a predatory device.

     TELDY
     Which I'm guessing explains the gas masks back at the lab.

     BECKETT
     God knows what the prolonged exposure to this mist could do to us.

     SHEPPARD
     I've got a great idea. Let's not find out.

     MIRELLUS
     We should wait here until dawn; then it will be safe.

     BECKETT
     Those things out there are not nocturnal. Day or night, it doesn't
     matter.

     SHEPPARD
     Besides, we can't sit around. We've gotta find Porter.

     MIRELLUS
     You can't be serious! You're going out there?

     SHEPPARD

     (to Beckett)
     Get back to work on that data. Try and figure out a way on how to
     deal with these things.

     BECKETT
     That might be a problem, Colonel. There's a reason Michael abandoned
     that research. Even he couldn't control those creatures.

     SHEPPARD
     Great.

   EXT--VILLAGE STREETS, NIGHT

   [They walk through the fog using large chemical glow-sticks for light.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Sure you're gonna be okay here?

     BECKETT
     As long as we're quiet, we'll be safer in here than you are out
     there.

   [He stakes a glow-stick in the ground.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. We're going to split up to cover more ground. Back in
     twenty.

     BECKETT
     Good luck.

   [The move off, each patrolling in their own. Sheppard hears the
   clicking and turns around, but not in time to see the creature. He
   continues on. Teldy holds her light-stick over the well. A creatures
   climbs the side of the well and attacks her. She fires her weapon.
   Nearby Mehra hears the gunfire and rushes to help. Elsewhere, Sheppard
   descends a staircase and hears stuttered breathing. He comes upon
   Porter, sitting in a corner in fear.]

     SHEPPARD
     Shh. Whatever you do, be quiet.

   [He helps her up and the head off.]

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

     MIRELLUS
     This was a mistake.

     BECKETT
     Keep your voice down.

     MIRELLUS

     (loudly)
     I told him it was too dangerous!

     BECKETT
     Shh! Quiet!

     MIRELLUS
     Instead of coming back here, we should have gone to the next
     village. We'd be safe there.

     BECKETT
     Shut it!

     MIRELLUS
     Now we could all--

   [Creatures burst through the door and drag Mirellus out. Beckett raises
   his gun but has no clear target. He rushes to pull a sliding wooden
   door across the new hole in the wall. Fog starts seeping under the
   door, and creatures rattle the door.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   [Sheppard and Porter meet up with Mehra after they wave their
   glow-sticks at each other through the fog.]

     MEHRA
     Ali, you okay?

     PORTER
     Yeah.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's head out.

   [They move away together. The see another glow-stick moving nearby.]

     MEHRA
     Colonel. It's Major Teldy. She doesn't see us.

   [She moves toward the light only to find the light-stick is embedded in
   the shoulder of a creature. She shoots it. Sheppard approaches.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to Mehra)
     Take the six.

   [The approach and enter the building where they'd left Beckett, finding
   Teldy there.]

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

     SHEPPARD
     I thought you were dead.

     TELDY
     Yeah, for a while there, so did I.

     SHEPPARD
     What about the others? Think they made it out?

     TELDY

     (bending down to look)
     Well, I'm guessing at least one of them didn't. I've got blood.

     PORTER
     Carson?

     SHEPPARD
     No way to know.

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   [Carson makes his way through the fog.]

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

     TELDY

     One of those things came crawling right up out of the well. It got
     me thinking.
     Those catacombs -- they run for miles in every direction. So I'm
     guessing that one of them runs right to that well and into the
     center of town.

     MEHRA
     That would explain how Michael could snag his test subjects without
     being seen.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, well, we saw twelve of those pods in the lab. I killed
     one back in the forest, so...

     MEHRA
     I tagged two -- which, incidentally, puts me in the lead.

     TELDY
     All right, well that brings us down to nine.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay, so now what? Any ideas?

     PORTER
     Well, those creatures possess a heightened auditory system that
     allows them to hunt blind. We could try exploiting it.

     MEHRA
     How?

     PORTER
     I don't know. Maybe luring them into an ambush.

     MEHRA
     What the hell do you plan on using as bait?

     PORTER

     (inspired, she holds up a laptop)
     This.

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   INT--VILLAGE BUILDING

   [Sheppard uses his compass and some bullets to represent the plan on a
   table.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, here's how it's gonna work. While you three are taking up
     high ground positions, Teldy and Porter here, Mehra over here. I'm
     gonna be on the ground setting charges.

     PORTER
     You're gonna blow the well?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, that's the plan.

     PORTER
     Okay, well you'd better use the timer. If the fog is messing with
     our radios and flashlights, chances are a remote detonator won't
     work either.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Once I get to the well, I'll turn on the computer.

     PORTER
     Okay. Well, I programmed it to emit an ultrasonic burst, so that'll
     draw them right to you. But remember, if it gets near the fog...

     SHEPPARD
     I'll put it halfway down. That should keep it out of reach and
     working long enough to attract all nine. You three, just take up
     positions, sit tight until you hear a signal, then open up on
     anything that moves.

     TELDY
     And what's the signal?

     SHEPPARD
     That would be the well blowing sky high.

     MEHRA
     And where will you be?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, hopefully as far away as possible.

     TELDY
     What if this goes sideways?

     SHEPPARD
     Don't be so negative, Teldy.

     TELDY
     I'm serious, Colonel.

     SHEPPARD
     You take up positions, you sit tight and wait for the signal. You
     don't move. You don't make a noise until the well blows.

     MEHRA
     Colonel, what if--

     SHEPPARD
     I think I've made myself clear, Sarge.

     MEHRA
     Yes, sir.

     SHEPPARD
     Do we all know what we're doing?

     TELDY
     Yes, sir.

     MEHRA
     Sir.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's go.

   [The all grab their gear.]

   EXT--VILLAGE NEAR WELL, NIGHT

   [Teldy, Porter, and Mehra take up positions on balconies overlooking
   the well. Sheppard approaches the well and starts to wench up the
   bucket, cringing because of the nose the rusty mechanism makes. Once
   the bucket is raised, he gets his gear from his backpack. He activates
   the laptop and puts it in the bucket, then lowers the bucket as quietly
   as possible. He steps back and sets the timer on the C-4 block for five
   minutes. Before he can throw it in the well, a creature attacks him,
   knocking the C-4 from his hand. The fight each other.]

   EXT--BALCONY ABOVE WELL, NIGHT

   [Nearby, Porter and Teldy hear the commotion but can't see anything.]

     PORTER
     What the hell's going on down there?

   EXT--VILLAGE NEAR WELL, NIGHT

   [Sheppard fires on the creature, and Beckett joins him to help.]

   EXT--BALCONY ABOVE WELL, NIGHT

     TELDY
     Not yet.

     PORTER
     Dammit!

     TELDY
     Just wait for it.

   EXT--VILLAGE NEAR WELL, NIGHT

   [Sheppard stays on his hands and knees, searching the area.]

     BECKETT
     You all right?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

     BECKETT
     Alison?

     SHEPPARD
     She's, uh, she's safe.

     BECKETT
     Thank god. What, did you lose something?

     SHEPPARD
     Uh, my C-4.

   [Unseen, the C-4 timer has clicked down to one and a half minutes. More
   creatures move in.]

     BECKETT
     Colonel, I think it's best that we get moving.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I get you.

   [The try to move away, but find themselves surrounded, backed up
   against the well.]

   EXT--BALCONY ABOVE WELL, NIGHT

     PORTER

     Come on, come on!
     (seeing movement)
     I see them.

     TELDY
     If you shoot now, you'll risk hitting the colonel. Just wait for the
     signal.

   [The C-4 explodes. Teldy, Porter, and Mehra fire into the area around
   the well, killing several creatures.]

     PORTER
     Colonel?

   EXT--VILLAGE NEAR WELL, NIGHT

   [The three walk among the dead creatures.]

     TELDY
     Is that all of them?

     MEHRA
     Eight, nine, plus the other three -- that makes twelve.

   [A creature rises up. They kill it.]

     MEHRA
     Sorry. That's nine. Plus the three, makes twelve.

     TELDY
     Right.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Major.

   INT--CATACOMBS

     TELDY

     (over radio)
     Colonel! Where are you?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Down the well, in the catacombs. I got Beckett. Need the three of
     you to rappel down here and join us.

   EXT--VILLAGE NEAR WELL, NIGHT

     TELDY

     (into radio)
     On our way.

   INT--CATACOMBS NEAR MICHAEL'S LAB

   [The reunited team makes their way through. The glow-sticks they had
   left earlier are still lit.]

     PORTER
     Oh, I just want to get back to Atlantis and sleep for a week.

     BECKETT
     Aye, I know what you mean. I promise this won't take long.

   [Allison seems to hesitate.]

     BECKETT
     Alison, are you okay?

     PORTER
     Uh, yeah. Hey, guys, d'you mind if I just hang back here? I've had
     enough mad science for one day.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, sure.

   [Beckett takes on her equipment.]

     MEHRA
     I'll keep her company.

     BECKETT
     We'll be quick.

   [Mehra gives Porter a knowing look, and she rolls her eyes.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

     BECKETT
     I want to make sure I get all the data on these creatures to save a
     return trip.

   INT--CATACOMBS NEAR MICHAEL'S LAB

   [There is a sound.]

     PORTER
     What was that?

     MEHRA
     What?

     PORTER
     I thought I heard something.

     MEHRA
     Relax, okay? There were twelve pods, we counted twelve kills. We got
     'em all.

     PORTER
     Yeah.

   [Mehra hears something and aims her weapon.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Sheppard notices a door he hadn't seen before. He approaches and
   pushes a button that opens it.]

     TELDY
     What is it?

   [They enter. There are is another row of pods, also open.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, crap.

     TELDY
     We didn't get them all.

   INT--CATACOMBS NEAR MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Mehra looks carefully at a wall.]

     MEHRA
     It's nothing.

   [A creature hangs from the ceiling and screams. They start shooting
   it.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [They hear the gunfire and head off running toward the catacombs.]

   INT--CATACOMBS NEAR MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Fog rolls down the corridor toward them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Porter! Mehra! All right. If they overtake our positions, I want you
     two to fall back. Take the second tunnel up. Go to the surface, dial
     the Gate.

     TELDY
     Now who's being negative?

   [A creature rushes out of the fog. They shoot it and then all the
   others who follow. They move slowly down the corridor.]

     MEHRA

     (shouting to them)
     All clear?

     SHEPPARD
     All clear.

   INT--BECKETT'S QUARTERS ON ATLANTIS

   [McKay watches as Beckett packs.]

     MCKAY
     Can't believe you're leaving already. You've been here, like, less
     than two weeks.

     BECKETT
     Well, I've completed my research into Michael's test subjects and
     passed my findings on to Doctor Lynch and his team, and now it's
     time to move onto the more important work of saving lives.

   [Sheppard enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey, Doc.

     BECKETT
     Maybe I spoke too soon. Another off-world situation requiring my
     expertise?

     SHEPPARD
     Actually, I just came to see if you needed some help.

     BECKETT
     Oh! Much appreciated.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, and by the way, how's Porter?

     MCKAY
     Who?

     BECKETT
     She's fine, fine. A couple of weeks of R and R and then she'll be
     back in the Pegasus galaxy. You know, Colonel, someone like her
     could be of real benefit to the type of work I'll be doing.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I'll bet.

     MCKAY
     Who's Porter?

     BECKETT
     Something you might want to mention to Mr Woolsey.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, consider it done!

   [Sheppard picks up one of Beckett's bags and they start to leave.]

     BECKETT
     Thank you!

     MCKAY
     Fine, you know what? I don't even want to know! Don't tell me!

   [He changes his mind and starts to follow them.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, come on, tell me!

   [The door closes before he can get through it.]
