   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [A Puddle Jumper flies through the active Stargate. The area around the
   'gate looks abandoned, with pieces of rusted metal strewn around. The
   Jumper leaves the immediate area.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard flies, with Teyla in the jump seat and McKay and Ronon behind
   them.]

     MCKAY
     Look familiar?

     RONON
     No.

     TEYLA
     Me either. I do not believe I have been to this planet before.

     MCKAY
     There's no sign of any settlements, at least nothing recent.

     RONON
     Other than the smoke from that campfire.

   [The forward view-screen shows smoke in the forest ahead. Teyla smiles
   at McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Oh. Yes, well, other than that.

     SHEPPARD
     I'll land within a few hundred yards.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The Jumper comes in low over a pond.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [The team walks through the village, which is made of tents and
   thatched huts, with bits of scrap metal around. There is smoke but no
   sign of people.]

     MCKAY
     It's primitive, definitely primitive. Probably not even worth making
     contact. What is that smell?

     SHEPPARD

     (calling out)
     Hello?

     TEYLA
     It appears they left in a hurry.

     SHEPPARD
     Just not used to friendlies coming out of the gate.

   [Ronon sees a cook fire and goes to it. He reaches for a spoonful of
   food from the metal pot.]

     MCKAY
     What are you--

   [Ronon puts the spoon to his mouth.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, my God, he's tasting it! You don't know what that is. That could
     be their laundry!

     RONON
     Pretty good!

   [He scoops up some more.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, yes, good idea. And when you're finished with their porridge,
     why don't we try their beds, hmm?

   [Ronon holds some dried meat up to McKay.]

     RONON
     Want some?

     MCKAY
     How good is it?

     SHEPPARD
     Leave it be, Goldilocks.

   [They hear the rush of arrows being fires.]

     RONON
     Get down!

   [Arrows land in the dirt all around them. Ronon is hit in the calf.]

     RONON
     Ah!

     MCKAY
     Take cover!

   [They rush to get behind boulders and metal pieces. Some of the
   attackers are visible through the forest; they shout at each other.
   Others come up behind them and start firing with slingshots. Smoke
   appears where the slingshot projectiles hit. The team returns fire.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell's in those slingshots?

   [Ronon sits up to deal with the arrow through his calf.]

     MCKAY
     Are you all right?

     RONON
     I'm fine.

   [He breaks off the arrow's shaft on the fletching side, then pulls it
   out of his leg from the other side.]

     RONON
     Ohh!

     SHEPPARD

     (shouting)
     You know This is not the way to make new friends! But we'll leave if
     you want us to!

   [The attackers are silent.]

     SHEPPARD
     Let's take that as a yes. Let's go back to the jumper. Teyla, you're
     on point. I'll take the six. McKay, help Ronon.

     RONON
     Don't worry about me.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm a worrier. Let the man give you a hand.

   [They get up, McKay supporting Ronon.]

     TORRELL
     Fire!

   [The slingshot group fires, pinning down the team. The team fires back.
   After a moment they hear the sound of aircraft flying in at low
   altitude. The craft comes to a hover above the. The jet-wash from the
   downward-facing nozzles blows on both the team and the attackers. The
   aircraft moves and aims its nozzles such that its jet-wash throws a
   group of the attackers backward to the ground.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, move! Move!

   [They move out, Torrell watching with an angry expression.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The team rushes up the ramp. Sheppard runs to the pilot station as
   everyone gets secure.]

     SHEPPARD
     Everyone in one piece?

   [The Jumper lifts off.]

     RONON
     Yeah, thanks to that ship.

   [Ronon starts to stand.]

     TEYLA
     Be still.

   [She starts to examine his leg.]

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I like their timing.

     MCKAY
     No kidding. Did you see that thing?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I saw that thing.

   [The ship maneuvers in front of the Jumper's front screen.]

     PILOT

     (over radio)
     Unidentified ship. This is the security vessel Poros. Follow us
     immediately, and we will lead you to the city.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Understood, Poros. And thanks for the help back there.
     (to team)
     That's how you make new friends.

   [Sheppard pilots the Jumper to follow the aircraft.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--OLESIAN CITY ON PLANET, DAY

   [The city is modern, similar to modern cities on Earth.]

   EXT--COURTYARD ON PLANET, DAY

   [The team is guided to meet a female official.]

     MARIN
     Welcome to Olesia. I am Marin.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard. Teyla Emmagan, Dr. Rodney
     McKay, Ronon Dex.

     MARIN
     Please follow me.

   [The start walking with her.]

     MARIN
     I sent a security detachment as soon as we detected your presence on
     the island. The prisoners there can be quite hostile.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.

     TEYLA
     Prisoners?

     MARIN

     Yes, the island's a penal colony. The prisoners usually don't cause
     much trouble, (smiling)
     as long as you don't try to land there.

     MCKAY
     Well, you could put up a sign.

     TEYLA
     The Stargate is on the island. Does this not affect your ability to
     trade with other worlds?

     MARIN
     Yes, of course. As a result, we have needed to be almost entirely
     self sufficient.

     SHEPPARD
     Then why put a prison there?

     TEYLA
     I believe the Magistrate is better suited to answer these questions.
     He's very eager to meet you.

   INT--MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE

     MAGISTRATE
     Your ship is a most intriguing design. I must admit, I'm surprised
     to find others in this galaxy whose technology rivals our own. Aside
     from the Wraith, I mean.

     MCKAY
     It's funny--I was about to make the exact same comment.

     MAGISTRATE
     Where do you come from?

     SHEPPARD
     Until recently, Atlantis.

     MAGISTRATE
     The ancestral city?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the Wraith a short time
     ago.

     MAGISTRATE
     How tragic.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we're pretty broken up about it.

     TEYLA
     We are part of a small group of people that were able to escape.

     MAGISTRATE
     How fortunate for you.

     MCKAY
     Yes, yes. Very fortunate. Look, getting back to the technology
     thing. I'm just curious. How have you been able to make such
     advancements without the Wraith stepping in?

     MAGISTRATE
     The Wraith have chosen to leave us alone.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     MAGISTRATE
     I don't know.

     RONON
     They've never come here?

     MAGISTRATE
     The Wraith have been here many times, but with the ancestral ring on
     the island, the Wraith have always been, uh...how shall I put this?
     Satiated with the prisoners living there. The Wraith have no need to
     venture any further.

   [McKay and Sheppard exchange glances.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that would explain why you put the prison there.

     MAGISTRATE
     The island has been a penal colony for hundreds of years. Its
     location there has benefited my people greatly.

     SHEPPARD
     Not all your people.

     MAGISTRATE
     I assure you, only the most violent criminals are sent there...as
     you discovered.

     RONON
     It's a good crime deterrent.

     MAGISTRATE
     Crime is virtually non-existent on Olesia. Unlike the prisoners, we
     pride ourselves on being a most hospitable and civilized people.

   [The team looks skeptical.]

   INT--OLESIAN BUILDING

   [The Magistrate takes the team on a tour of a glass-walled building.]

     MAGISTRATE
     This section of the city is devoted to scientific research. Our
     scientists have recently attained success in the enrichment of a
     fissionable, yet non-radioactive, material to be used in generating
     power for the city.

     MCKAY
     Fissionable yet non-radioactive? Well, that-that-that's...is that
     even possible? What kind of material is it?

     MAGISTRATE
     It's an ore extracted from a mineral found on our planet. It's quite
     volatile, yet yields great promise.

     MAGISTRATE
     I'd be very happy to show you the laboratory.

     MCKAY
     I'd be very happy to see it.

     SHEPPARD
     I'd be very happy to go back to our ship. Our people are due to
     check in with us in a little while over radio. I'll have to get back
     within range.

     MAGISTRATE
     You can link with one of our radio relay stations. There should be
     enough power to reach the island, if that's your concern.

     SHEPPARD
     So we'll be speaking privately?

     MAGISTRATE
     Of course.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     And you believe they might be willing to share some of this mineral?

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Well, they seem open to it. They don't get many trading
     opportunities coming through the 'gate.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Sounds promising.

   INT--RECEPTION HALL IN OLESIAN BUILDING

   [Food is laid out on tables. Ronon and McKay check in out.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     There is, however, the minor moral hiccup of their form of capital
     punishment.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     I'm sorry?

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     They have an island. It's their own version of Alcatraz, where they
     send their worst criminals.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     And the gate is on the island, so...

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     So the Wraith feed on the prisoners?

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Yep.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.

   INT--RECEPTION HALL ON PLANET

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     I prefer lethal injection, although I do have a certain fondness for
     the electric chair. Call me a romantic.

   [Sheppard chuckles.]

     RONON

     (into radio, biting into a piece of food)
     The Wraith get what they want, and the Olesians get left alone. I'm
     surprised it works.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     He did, however, say that only the most violent criminals get sent
     there, and that it has been this way for hundreds of years.

     TEYLA

     (on comm, to Sheppard)
     Do you kill all of your violent criminals on Earth?

     MCKAY

     (on comm)
     Certain countries, yes.

     SHEPPARD

     (on comm)
     Do we need to get into this right now?

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Well, we do if we plan on doing business with these people.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     I want to know more before I jump to any conclusions.

   EXT--OLESIAN CITY ON PLANET, DAY

   INT--MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE

     SHEPPARD
     We were able to speak with our people, thank you.

     MAGISTRATE
     Of course.

     SHEPPARD
     If you're open to it, we'd like to discuss possible trade
     opportunities.

     MAGISTRATE
     We are very open. I'm sure there is much that we can learn from each
     other.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, Dr. Elizabeth Weir will be the one to begin official
     negotiations with you. That's really her thing.

     MAGISTRATE
     I'm looking forward to meeting her, and to the start of a promising
     friendship.

   EXT--PLANET ABOVE WATER, DAY

   [The Puddle Jumper skims the water.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Seriously, am I the only one creeped out by that guy?

     SHEPPARD
     Politicians, Rodney--they're all creepy.

   EXT--PRISONER ISLAND, DAY

   [Torrell sees the Jumper through a makeshift telescope.]

     TORRELL
     Prepare to fire!

   [His men prepare to fire home-made cannons.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Margaret Thatcher wasn't creepy. Okay, well, maybe a little. She
     resembled an aunt of mine--same hair style, facial structure, only
     my aunt was much taller and remarkably hirsute. Oddest thing--she
     had to shave twice a day.

   [Sheppard and Teyla roll their eyes.]

   EXT--PRISONER ISLAND, DAY

     TORRELL
     Fire!

   [The prisoners light off the cannons, firing large metal balls at the
   Jumper.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     TEYLA
     What was that?

     SHEPPARD
     They're shooting at us.

   [Smoke appears in front of the Jumper.]

     TEYLA
     The prisoners?

     MCKAY
     With what?

     RONON
     Cloak the ship.

     SHEPPARD
     I can't. We took some damage. We'll be lucky to make it to the
     'gate.

     MCKAY
     Well, how close are we?

     SHEPPARD
     Close enough to dial.

   [Teyla starts dialing.]

   EXT--PRISONER ISLAND, DAY

   [The prisoners light off more cannon fire. One ball explodes near the
   Jumper without hitting it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     RONON
     That was close.

     SHEPPARD
     Get ready to send an I.D.C.

   EXT--PRISONER ISLAND, DAY

   [The Puddle Jumper is hit by fire and immediately starts to descend.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD
     I've lost control systems. Hang on.

   EXT--PRISONER ISLAND, DAY

   [The Jumper descends into the forrest. The prisoners see this and
   cheer.]

     TORRELL
     Now find them!

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [The Jumper is heavily damaged, having come to rest after gouging a
   path through the earth.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Teyla regains consciousness first.]

     RONON
     Oh...

     TEYLA
     Are you all right?

     MCKAY
     I think I chipped a tooth. Did I chip a tooth? Am I bleeding?
     Because I'm a high risk for endocarditis.

   [Sheppard rouses.]

     TEYLA
     John?

     SHEPPARD
     That was, uh...not one of my better landings. Sorry.

     RONON
     The gate should still be active for a few minutes.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Let's go.

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [The walk down the smoky ramp. Torrell and the prisoners rush up on
   them, pointing their crude weapons. Sheppard gestures for Ronon to
   raise his hands.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hi, folks. I hope I didn't crash-land on anybody.

   EXT--PRISONER VILLAGE, DAY

   [The prisoners have pulled everything from the Jumper and are examining
   it. Torrell fires off a P-90 into a pond. Another prisoner aims a
   bazooka, but it fires the opposite direction he intends, taking out a
   tent behind him. After a moment, the men laugh.]

   INT--PRISONER SHACK

   [All four team members are tied up with their arms around a pole behind
   their backs, and their necks tied to vertical supports. Torrell and
   some men enter.]

     SHEPPARD
     You should know our people are expecting us. If we don't show up
     soon, they'll come looking for us.

     TORRELL
     Ah. Is that supposed to concern me?

     SHEPPARD
     Don't go getting all full of yourself, chief. A few cannons are no
     match for the kind of firepower they'll be bringing with them.
     Although...I should compliment whoever took that first shot--it was
     a good one.

     TORRELL
     Yeah, it was nice, wasn't it?

     TEYLA
     What do you want from us?

     TORRELL
     Well, we've already got your weapons.

     TORRELL
     Now I do believe we'll take your ship. You see, we had been planning
     a little trip to the mainland but after seeing you fly that thing
     through the ancestral ring--

     MCKAY
     You're referring to the ship you just shot down? The one that
     doesn't stand a hope in hell of ever flying again?

     TORRELL
     The ship that you're going to fix, yes.

     MCKAY
     Who am I, MacGyver? Fix it with what?

     TORRELL

     (to one of his men)
     Get him up.

   [McKay is made to stand. He appears very concerned.]

     TORRELL
     You seem like a smart man. I'm sure you'll think of something. Maybe
     all you need is a little motivation.

   [He fires Ronon's blaster past Rodney to blow a large whole in the side
   of the shack.]

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe you should think about fixing it, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Good idea.

     TORRELL
     My friends all tell me I have a remarkable gift for persuasion.

   [A prisoner starts to untie McKay.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR
     What happened?

     TECHNICIAN
     The gate activated. Nothing came through.

     WEIR
     Colonel Sheppard?

     TECHNICIAN
     So we assumed. We received no I.D.C., a few moments later, the gate
     shuts down.

     WEIR
     They should've returned by now. Dial the planet and try to establish
     a radio link.

     TECHNICIAN
     Yes, ma'am.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Major Lorne, this is Weir.

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Go ahead.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     I may have to go off-world to assist Colonel Sheppard. I'd like you
     to assemble a team and have a puddle jumper ready to go.

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Yes, ma'am.

   EXT--PRISONER VILLAGE, DAY

   INT--PRISONER SHACK

   [The three are trying to loosen their bindings.]

     SHEPPARD
     Anyone having any luck?

     RONON
     Not yet.

     TEYLA
     These bindings are very secure.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, leave it to convicts to know the best way to tie people up.

     RONON

     (angry)
     Well, eventually I will get free and when I do, he's going to pay
     for this.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, listen to me. When you get free, you get us free, and we all
     get out of here. Let 'em find out we're gone after we're gone.

     RONON
     You expect me to let them get away with this?

     SHEPPARD
     The operative words are "get away."

     RONON
     After I kill him...

     SHEPPARD
     That type of thinking will get us killed.

     RONON
     Well, if you would've returned fire--

     SHEPPARD
     The weapons systems were damaged.

     RONON
     If you say so.

     SHEPPARD

     (intensely)
     I do say so, and right now, I'm saying knock it off.

     RONON
     Is that an order, Sheppard?

     SHEPPARD

     (sternly)
     I am beat up, tied up, and couldn't order a pizza right now if I
     wanted to, but if you need it to be, yeah, it's an order.

     RONON

     (calmed)
     Okay.

   [Sheppard looks at Ronon with some amazement.]

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [Several prisoners wait outside the Jumper.]

     MCKAY
     There is no power getting to any of these controls. You understand?

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [McKay and Torrell are inside.]

     MCKAY
     Look. Nothing!

     TORRELL
     Why not?

     MCKAY
     Let me go out on a limb here and say that maybe it had something to
     do with the crash. Which, of course, begs the question--how the hell
     did you get your hands on explosives?

     TORRELL
     Eldon made them. He fashioned a composite out of minerals and
     materials he found around the island. Crude, yes, but effective. We
     shot you down, didn't we?

     MCKAY
     Eldon? Who is Eldon?

   [A man walks up the ramp.]

     ELDON
     That would be me.

     MCKAY
     You're a prisoner?

     ELDON
     I was accused of killing one man--

     TORRELL
     He's a scientist.

     ELDON
     It was a case of mistaken identity.

     TORRELL
     Tell you what, Eldon. You can tell him your whole life story. Just
     help him fix the ship.

     MCKAY
     Look, I don't know what you expect me to do. I don't have any of the
     proper diagnostic tools, not to mention the fact that...

     TORRELL
     You'll figure it out.

     MCKAY
     And if I don't?

     TORRELL
     Well, I could kill you. But you strike me as the type of man who,
     despite being weak and cowardly on the outside, harbors a strength
     of character he doesn't even know he has.

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry, was there a compliment in there?

     TORRELL
     See, the way to motivate a man like you, Mr. McKay--not to threaten
     your life. It's to threaten the lives of your friends.

   [McKay gives a look of concern.]

     TORRELL
     That's right. Fix the ship. Otherwise, they start dying, one after
     another, until you change your mind...or until they're all dead. I
     don't care.

   [Torrell leaves. McKay starts to work on a console.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Lorne is at the controls. Weir enters.]

     WEIR
     All set?

     LORNE
     Ready to go. Still no word from them?

     WEIR
     Nothing.

     LORNE
     Don't worry. We'll find them.

   [Two special forces soldiers sit behind them.]

     WEIR
     I was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement. Now I'm worried I have
     to negotiate their release.

     LORNE
     We don't know that.

     WEIR
     Dial the gate, but go to stealth mode the moment we're through.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The Jumper comes through the 'gate and immediately cloaks itself.]

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [The prisoners hear the 'gate activate but don't see anything come
   through.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ELDON
     The technology on this ship is far more advanced than the Olesians'.

     MCKAY
     How ironic, then, to have been shot down by the cast of Braveheart.

     ELDON
     Well, I'm surprised we were able to shoot you down.

     MCKAY
     Well, it's the old low-tech versus high-tech argument, I suppose.

     ELDON
     We've been working on those weapons for years--

     MCKAY
     Yes, well, well done. Good for them, huh? Now, are you going to
     continue talking or, uh... Thank you.

   [Eldon holds up a Jumper control crystal.]

     MCKAY

     (grabbing it)
     Oh...give me that. Where did that come from?

   EXT--PRISONER VILLAGE, DAY

   [Torrell is looking over SGA's equipment. One of the radios beeps. He
   clicks the push-to-talk and hears static, then picks up another radio.
   He appears to figure out what they are.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Those cannons. Your design?

     ELDON

     (stuttering slightly)
     No, no, no. Well, I chose the material and helped calculate
     trajectories. The ignition mechanisms...and the fuses, of course.
     But most of my efforts went into fashioning the explosive shots.

     MCKAY
     Ah, explosives. Was that how you killed a man?

     ELDON
     I didn't kill him. I'm innocent. I don't belong here.

     MCKAY
     Hmm. Really. I wonder if there's ever been a convicted felon who
     didn't claim he was innocent?

     ELDON
     I don't care if you don't believe me. I just want off this island.

     MCKAY

     (noticing something)
     Oh, no...

     ELDON
     What is it?

     MCKAY
     I assume there's no DHD beside the Stargate?

     MCKAY
     Uh, the ancestral ring, is there some kind of a dialing device that
     turns it on?

     ELDON
     No. Nothing.

     MCKAY
     Oh, of course. Why give the prisoners such an obvious means of
     escape?

     ELDON
     What's wrong?

     MCKAY
     The main power distribution conduit has been damaged. That
     effectively cuts all the power to the primary systems--drive pods,
     cockpit controls, DHD.

     ELDON
     Can you fix it?

     MCKAY
     Easily...if I had a replacement. Without one, you and your friends
     aren't going anywhere.

     ELDON
     Neither are you. If you don't fix this ship, Torrell's going to make
     sure you're the first the Wraith find at the next culling.

   EXT--PRISONER VILLAGE, DAY

   INT--PRISONER SHACK

   [Ronon, Sheppard, and Teyla are still tied up. Torrell forces McKay in.
   He's tied up again. Eldon enters as well.]

     TORRELL
     Choose.

     MCKAY
     Choose what?

     TORRELL
     Which one of them dies first... Do it.

     MCKAY

     (looking at teammates)
     I can't do that.

     TORRELL
     Well, then, I'll choose for you. Either way, one of them dies,
     unless you change your mind about fixing that ship.

     MCKAY
     Well, I'm sorry, but there are some things beyond my capability.

     TORRELL
     I don't believe you.

     MCKAY
     Well, I know it is hard to believe, but--

     TORRELL
     No. I think you're lying.

     MCKAY
     I'm not. It's broken. You don't understand "broken?"

     TORRELL
     I know your type. You whine, and you complain, and you see to it
     that your every task is viewed as some impossible achievement so
     that when you do succeed, your gargantuan efforts are viewed as all
     the more heroic.

     MCKAY
     That may be true in some cases, but this is not one of them.

   [Sheppard gives him a look at the admission.]

     MCKAY
     You are asking me to do the impossible.

     TORRELL
     Your friends' lives are in your hands. I'll give you some time to
     choose.

   [Torrell leaves. Another prisoner forces McKay to the floor and ties
   him down. He grunts in discomfort.]

     ELDON
     Listen to him, McKay. He's killed 11 people: eight before he was
     sent here and three since he's been on the island.

     MCKAY

     That's 11, huh? You've got some catching up to do, don't you?
     (to Sheppard)
     He's only killed one.

     SHEPPARD
     Who? Him?

     ELDON
     I told you, I'm here because of a mistake.

     RONON
     I'm sure everyone here on this island says that.

     ELDON
     Well, as a matter of fact, some of us are innocent. Only a few, like
     Torrell, are actual murderers.

     TEYLA
     You mean they put all their criminals here, regardless of the crimes
     they commit?

     ELDON
     Once, only the worst of the worst were sent here. But the punishment
     proved to be such a successful deterrent that crime rates in Olesia
     plummeted, which meant fewer and fewer prisoners.

     TEYLA
     Less food for the Wraith.

     ELDON
     Exactly.

     SHEPPARD
     So they lowered the bar.

   INT--OLESIAN BUILDING

   [The Magistrate leads Weir, Lorne, and his mean through the modern
   building.]

     MAGISTRATE
     They have not returned to the planet?

     WEIR
     No, and we haven't been able to establish radio contact with them,
     either.

     MAGISTRATE
     They didn't return to the city. Perhaps they traveled through the
     ring to another planet.

     WEIR
     No, they would've radioed first.

     MARIN
     Something must've happened on the island. I'll alert our security
     teams, have them begin a search.

     LORNE
     We'll join them.

     MAGISTRATE
     I would advise against that.

     WEIR
     Would you?

     MAGISTRATE
     The island is extremely dangerous. Our ships are heavily armored. We
     know the terrain, as well as the prisoners' tactics. Don't worry.
     We'll find them.

     WEIR
     I hope you do, Magistrate, for all our sakes.

     MAGISTRATE
     Of course.

   [The Magistrate and Marin leave. Lorne and Weir exchange looks.]

   INT--PRISONER SHACK

   [Ronon pulls on his bindings. His wrists are bleeding.]

     RONON
     I think they're loosening.

     SHEPPARD
     Take it easy, Chewie. You're going to cut your damn hands off.

     TEYLA
     The more we struggle, the tighter the bindings get.

   [The rear of the shack is pulled open, and Eldon enters.]

     ELDON

     (holding up a knife)
     You need something like this.

     MCKAY
     What about the guards?

     ELDON
     They stepped away. No one's watching.

     TEYLA
     Will you help us?

     ELDON
     If you'll help me.

     SHEPPARD
     How?

     ELDON
     Fix the ship. Let me leave with you.

     MCKAY
     Oh, for God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you--

     ELDON
     I know you could do it. I could see it in your eyes when you were
     working. You were holding something back from us.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Nobody could fix it. I don't care who you think I am, or what you
     think you saw in my eyes, but it is totally, completely impossible.

     ELDON
     Torrell and his men are going to return soon.

     SHEPPARD
     He'll fix it.

     MCKAY
     I just said I couldn't.

     SHEPPARD

     You really suck at lying, Rodney.
     (to Eldon)
     We have a deal.

     MCKAY
     There is one slight possibility.

     SHEPPARD
     Huh? See?

     MCKAY
     I won't actually be able to fix the ship to fly out of here, but I
     might be able to cobble together enough power from secondary systems
     to activate the DHD. That way, we can dial the gate and leave on
     foot. When I say "might," I mean probably not. It's a long shot at
     best. I'd have to bypass the main power distribution conduit--

     SHEPPARD
     Get us out of here.

   [Eldon cuts Ronon free first. Ronon grabs the knife and holds it to
   Eldon's throat.]

     MCKAY
     Ronon, what are you doing?

     RONON
     Give me one reason why I shouldn't cut your throat.

     SHEPPARD
     For one, it would make a mess. Look, we made a deal. Just let him
     go.

   [Ronon lets go. He cuts the collar around his neck, then cuts
   Sheppard's bindings, then Teyla's. He goes to cut McKay's, but it is
   near his stomach.]

     MCKAY
     Careful, careful.

     RONON
     Suck it up!

   [He frees McKay. They sneak out the back of the shack. They don't see
   the radio sitting active under some rope.]

   EXT--WOODS ON PLANET, DAY

   [They walk in single file. Sheppard signals for them to crouch.]

     RONON
     Why are we stopping?

     SHEPPARD

     This is way too easy. All right, stay close and (looking at McKay)
     stay quiet.

     MCKAY
     What? Why does he say that to me?

     TEYLA
     Shh!

   [They jog through the woods and stop in sight of the Jumper. No one is
   guarding it. Then they see archers hidden in the woods nearby.]

     ELDON
     I didn't know anything about this, I swear.

     TEYLA
     We will never be able to make it to the Jumper. They have our
     weapons.

     RONON
     We don't need weapons.

     MCKAY
     How about the fact that they seriously outnumber us?

     SHEPPARD
     At least we've got the element of surprise.

     RONON
     I was beginning to think you were afraid to fight.

     SHEPPARD

     No, I'm just naturally lazy, but I will if I have to. And it's
     starting to look like we have to.
     (to McKay)
     How much time do you need to rework the DHD?

     MCKAY
     Well, in a perfect world, two days.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Right now, uh, ten minutes, give or take.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, we need to create a diversion. We're going to split up,
     flank them, get them looking everywhere except the Jumper. Hopefully
     we can buy enough time to steal back our weapons.

   [The 'gate activates nearby.]

     SHEPPARD
     Or we could just dial the gate.

     TEYLA
     They fixed the DHD?

     MCKAY
     That's impossible.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't think they're the ones who dialed it.

   [A Wraith dart comes through the 'gate and flies toward them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Get down!

     ELDON
     It didn't see us.

     RONON
     It saw us. It didn't care.

     MCKAY
     Why not?

     SHEPPARD
     Who cares? They left the Jumper.

   [They rush toward the Jumper.]

   INT--OLESIAN BUILDING

     MAGISTRATE
     I'm afraid the news is not good. Our rescue teams had just begun
     their search on the island when the ancestral ring activated.

     WEIR
     The Wraith?

     MAGISTRATE
     It appears a culling is under way. We're not sure how many ships are
     involved, but our teams were forced to pull back. I'm not giving up
     hope. I'll send teams back in the moment the Wraith are gone.
     Hopefully your friends will have evaded the culling. I must attend
     to this.

   [He rushes off. Weir and Lorne exchange concerned looks.]

   INT--MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE

     MAGISTRATE
     I apologize for my tardiness. I had an urgent matter to attend
     to...a matter which could ultimately benefit us both.

   [It is revealed he's speaking to a Wraith.]

     WRAITH
     In that case...apology accepted.

   [The sips from a glass of wine or something equivalent.]

     WRAITH
     Exceptional, as always. I think this is my favorite vintage yet.

   [The banquet table is covered with dishes of food.]

     MAGISTRATE
     I hope you find the food acceptable as well. My new chef is quite
     accomplished.

     WRAITH
     I certainly hope so. Your previous chef, unfortunately, proved to be
     far more appetizing than the meals he prepared.

   [He eats a bit of food, tossing it back into his throat with apparent
   relish.]

     MAGISTRATE
     I must admit...I still find it intriguing to watch you eat actual
     food.

     WRAITH
     Our lineage may have diverged, but there are those of us who still
     retain an appreciation for finer things. And although it may provide
     a moment's pleasure...it does not sustain me.

   [He stands and walks around the room.]

     WRAITH
     This arrangement I have made with you and your predecessors has
     served both of us well. While others of my kind have been forced to
     sleep between cullings, I have enjoyed a steady stream of humans for
     my consumption, and the taste of their defiance is sweet. You, in
     return, have been allowed to live in peace.

     MAGISTRATE
     We thank you for that.

     WRAITH
     But...throughout the galaxy, hives continue to wake in far greater
     numbers than are sustainable, and with a hunger that is most
     pressing.

     MAGISTRATE

     (becoming nervous)
     I assure you that I have put measures in place to augment the
     population on the island.

     WRAITH
     Then why is it there are even fewer inhabitants on the island?
     Others of my kind would have destroyed your entire planet...but I am
     more civilized than that.

     MAGISTRATE

     (desperately)
     And I thank you for your generosity.

     WRAITH
     Still, there are interests which must be served. There are many
     Wraith who hunger... And I have promised to provide for them. The
     decision you are now faced with is..on whom shall we feed?

     MAGISTRATE
     Your needs shall be met. You have my promise.

     WRAITH
     Good. I would hate to see anything happen to you.

     WRAITH
     I do so enjoy our dinners together.

   [He smiles falsely.]

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [Ronon sees and hears the Dart rush by. He limps up the ramp into the
   Jumper.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     RONON
     The dart went back through the gate.

     TEYLA
     I do not know why it did not cull anyone.

     RONON
     Maybe it did. It headed for the mainland when it first came through.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, keep watch.

   [Ronon rushes back out.]

     SHEPPARD
     How's it coming, Rodney?

   [McKay is working under the forward control panels. Eldon is beside
   him.]

     MCKAY
     Slower than I expected, but faster than humanly possible.

     SHEPPARD
     Any chance of getting the cloaking generator powered up, too? Could
     really come in handy right about now.

     MCKAY
     Okay, and how about a snack? Maybe you'd like me to make you a nice
     sandwich?

     SHEPPARD
     Only if it's humanly possible.

     MCKAY
     It would be a miracle if I get the DHD back on, let alone the
     cloaking generator. And even if I could manage that, the power will
     be intermittent at best.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. Well, FYI, the Wraith have all gone, so it's just a matter of
     time before Torrell and his boys return...with all of our weapons.

     MCKAY

     (annoyed)
     I get it!

     SHEPPARD

     (annoyed)
     Good.

   INT--RECEPTION HALL IN OLESIAN BUILDING

   [Weir, Lorne, and his men wait. Marin enters, looking concerned.]

     WEIR
     Marin? What's happened?

     MARIN
     No one must know I'm speaking to you.

     WEIR
     Of course.

     MARIN
     You should leave--as soon as possible.

     LORNE
     Why?

     MARIN
     The Magistrate has just rescinded my orders to send rescue teams
     back to the island.

     WEIR
     What? Why would he do that?

     MARIN
     Several arrests have been made. Many people in the city have been
     apprehended for unspecified violations to be sent to the island to
     increase the population there.

     LORNE
     To keep the Wraith fed.

     MARIN
     This has been going on for some time, but never so bad as this. The
     number of arrests is--I cannot keep quiet any longer. I have to
     speak out.

   [The door opens. The Magistrate enters, with an entourage.]

     MAGISTRATE

     (quietly civil)
     Lies. Seeding fear not only among your own people, but now our
     guests. I cannot allow it.

     MARIN
     I was only trying to understand why so many people are being
     arrested.

     MAGISTRATE
     Your job is not to question the actions of this government.

   [He signals for his men to take her, which they do.]

     MARIN
     No. Wait! Help me! Please!

   [She is taken out of the room.]

     WEIR
     Where are they taking her?

     MAGISTRATE
     I'm sorry you had to witness that.

     WEIR
     What crime has she committed?

     MAGISTRATE
     I have recently learned that Marin has been involved in a group
     seeking to undermine the Olesian government. She's become very adept
     at spinning lies to suit her organization's treasonable agenda.

     WEIR
     Did you or did you not rescind the order to send rescue teams back
     to the island?

     MAGISTRATE
     Why would I do that?

     WEIR
     That doesn't concern me. My first concern is with the safety of my
     people, and I promise you--

     MAGISTRATE
     Everything is being done to ensure their rescue and safe return. If
     there has been any hindrance at all, it was because of Marin.

     WEIR
     What's going to happen to her now?

     MAGISTRATE
     She'll receive a fair trial in our courts.

     LORNE
     And then what, sent to the island?

     MAGISTRATE
     I'm sure where you come from, treason is also considered a very
     serious offense.

     LORNE
     So that's a "yes."

     WEIR
     Tell me, what else is considered a serious offense around here?

     MAGISTRATE
     Anything that threatens the welfare of the Olesian people.

     WEIR
     Are you sure it's the welfare of the people that concerns you? Or
     just your own?

     MAGISTRATE
     Choose your words very carefully, Dr. Weir.

     WEIR
     Oh, I do. Why? Is that a threat?

     MAGISTRATE
     It's advice...from one ally to another.

     WEIR

     Well, this alliance...it's just been rescinded.
     (to her people)
     We're leaving.

   [The Magistrate gestures to his men.]

     WEIR
     What, do you plan to arrest us, too? Because you do not want to do
     that.

   [Lorne and his men bring their weapons to bear on the Magistrate. The
   Magistrate nods at Weir and indicates for his men to stand down. They
   step out of the way and let Weir and her team leave.]

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [Ronon sees some prisoners returning. He calls inside the Jumper.]

     RONON
     Party's over.

     SHEPPARD
     And we were having such a good time.

   [Sheppard and Teyla join Ronon.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, let's see if we can hold them off.

   [He goes back inside.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to McKay)
     As soon as you get the DHD back online, dial the gate and make a run
     for it. When you get back to Atlantis, start working on those
     sandwiches. We'll be right behind you.

     MCKAY
     Two minutes! Hold them that long, we're good to go.

   [Unarmed, Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon make run to the woods, splitting
   up and taking cover where they can. Teyla finds a stick and breaks it
   in half over her knee. Sheppard tries to do the same, but it's too hard
   and he grabs his knee and has to fight not to yell. He takes a thicker
   stick to use as a weapon. They maneuver behind some prisoners. Sheppard
   takes out two with the stick, while Teyla and Ronon take out four more.
   Prisoners armed with the SGA weapons come up on them.]

     PRISONER
     Don't move!

   [They stop and raise their hands.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     That's it! I did it! We're ready to dial!

   [The look up to see Torrell and his men are back.]

     TORRELL
     See that? I knew you could do it.

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [Other prisoners have brought back the rest of the team. The force
   Ronon apart and onto his knees.]

     PRISONER
     Kill him.

     MCKAY
     Oh, no, no. You don't have to do that. If you want me to dial the
     gate for you, that's fine. There are hundreds of suitable planets
     out there you can go to.

     TORRELL
     Yes, and there are hundreds of unsuitable planets you can send me
     to, aren't there?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but I won't send you to one of those.

     TORRELL
     I think our best option is to just come with you, to your
     planet...provided you got more of these lying around there, do you?

     SHEPPARD
     Forget it.

     TORRELL
     I'm sorry?

     SHEPPARD
     We'll dial you another address. You can go through. But we're not
     taking you home.

     TORRELL
     You are aware of the fact that we have all of your weapons pointed
     at you, right?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, you're going to murder us the minute we step through the
     gate anyways. What difference does it make?

     TORRELL
     That's very distrustful.

   [They hear something coming.]

     PRISONER
     Wait, look!

     MCKAY
     Oh no...

   [A Wraith cruiser is making its way slowly toward them, as if coming in
   for a landing.]

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The Jumper cruises over the water toward the island. Lorne brings up
   the HUD.]

     LORNE
     We've got a Wraith cruiser headed for the island, and I'm picking up
     several more on approach outside the atmosphere.

   [The Jumper cloaks.]

     WEIR
     Go to stealth mode. Let's find our guys before they do.

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

     TORRELL
     What is that? What is that?

     SHEPPARD
     It's a Wraith cruiser, and trust me, you don't want to be around
     when it gets here.

   [Ronon takes his stunner from Torrell before he can react, then points
   it at the armed prisoners.]

     TORRELL
     Come on.

     SHEPPARD

     Wait, wait.
     (to McKay)
     Dial the gate.

     MCKAY

     (from inside)
     Stop!

     SHEPPARD
     If all the prisoners get off this island, where do you think that
     ship will go?

   [The cruiser is getting closer.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No! We've got a big problem in
     here!

   [Sheppard and others rush in.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's wrong?

     MCKAY
     I lost power to the DHD.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     MCKAY
     I told you the power feed would be intermittent at best. We
     should've dialed when I patched it instead of standing around
     talking--

     SHEPPARD
     Can you fix it?

     MCKAY
     I don't know.

     RONON
     They're right on top of us.

     TORRELL
     We could shoot them down.

     TEYLA
     Neither your weapons nor ours will damage it.

     SHEPPARD
     What about the drones? Can you patch enough power to arm them?

     MCKAY
     They're not as intricate as the DHD. Maybe one, given the time
     constraints.

     SHEPPARD
     Then do it.

     TEYLA
     Can one drone shoot down an entire Wraith cruiser?

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe we'll get a lucky shot. McKay?

     MCKAY

     (working on console)
     Almost...just give me one more...and...okay! We're armed! Go, before
     the power cuts out again!

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [Sheppard fires a drone, which hits the belly of the cruiser, doing
   significant damage.]

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     LORNE
     Did you see that?

     WEIR
     A drone.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD
     We scored a hit. That's either going to buy us time or piss 'em off.

     MCKAY
     If they didn't know we were here, they sure as hell do now.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, you damaged the Wraith cruiser...

   [Her voices comes over the radio Torrell is holding.]

     MCKAY
     Dr. Weir...

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     ...And it's leaving the area. But there are two more cruisers
     incoming.

     TORRELL

     (handing over the radio)
     Here.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Elizabeth, where are you?

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     We're in Jumper 2. We're cloaked, directly above you.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Are you all right?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Our jumper's disabled. Right now, I need you to dial the gate to one
     of the back-up planets to the Alpha site. Doesn't matter which one.

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Understood.
     (to Lorne)
     Do it.

   EXT--STARGATE ON OLESIAN PLANET, DAY

   [The Stargate engages.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Yelling so those outside can hear him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Okay, everyone who wanted off of this planet...now's your chance!

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [The prisoners run for the Stargate.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD
     Time to go.

     TORRELL
     Why should we trust you? Huh?

     SHEPPARD
     If you want to stay, stay. I really don't give a damn, but you are
     not coming home with us!

     ELDON

     (standing in objection)
     But I--

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can come.

   [Eldon sits back down. Torrell gives a half-hearted salute and leaves.
   Ronon gives him a predatory smile.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Elizabeth I need you to keep the gate open until the last of them go
     through, then shut it down. Dial Atlantis.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     We can land and pick you up.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Negative, just keep the gate open. We'll take it from there. Stay in
     stealth mode till the Wraith have gone away.

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR

     (into radio, hesitant)
     Acknowledged.

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [Dozens of prisoners, now including women, rush for the nearby 'gate.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [They hear the 'gate shut down.]

     SHEPPARD
     Here comes another cruiser.

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR
     Dial Atlantis.

   [Lorne starts to dial.]

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     We're dialing. Head for the gate.

   [Sheppard leaves the radio behind and they all run out.]

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [The damaged cruiser moves away while another one arrives. The team
   runs to the 'gate. The cruiser fires on them as they run, causing
   explosions around them. The jump through the active wormhole just as
   the 'gate is hit by a blast.]

   INT--LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     LORNE
     They're through.

   [Weir sags back in relief.]

   EXT--PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY

   [The second cruiser moves away.]

   INT--MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE

   [The Magistrate watches in silent horror as a cruiser descends into the
   city.]

   FADE OUT
