   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DAY

   [Buzzards circle overhead as crime scene investigators study a
   pentangular roped-off section of the desert. While some study a body; a
   woman outside the perimeter takes photos of flagged tire tracks. She
   notices a run-down, aged, red Camaro drive up and park. Sheppard steps
   out of the vehicle. She tries to get his attention as he walks to the
   crime scene.]

     REPORTER
     Sheppard! Detective Sheppard...Detective Sheppard! Come on, John.
     I'm breaking this with or without you.

     SHEPPARD

     (muttering)
     What is she doing here?

     REPORTER
     Is this victim related to the others? If we have a serial killer on
     our hands, people have a right to know.

   [One of the technicians approaches Sheppard.]

     CSI TECH
     Victim was most likely a white male.

   [Sheppard does a double take.]

     SHEPPARD
     "Most likely?"

     CSI TECH
     No clothes. No I.D. Wasn't killed here.

   [Flashback theory shows victim and killer struggling in a car.]

     CSI TECH

     (pointing to another area)
     Got tire tracks leading from the road. Based on size, tread-wear and
     spread, we're probably talking an older model pickup.

   [Flashback theory shows the killer stepping out of his vehicle, opening
   the passenger side door, and dumping the body out before walking back
   to the driver's side.]

     CSI TECH

     (pointing to a stain in the sand)
     Got radiator fluid down here. Looks like the vehicle has a leak.

   [Flashback theory shows truck leaking radiator fluid as it drives away
   from the scene.]

   [Sheppard looks around the scene, then walks over to where the body is
   covered by a plastic tarpaulin. He pulls it back to show a dried husk
   of a human corpse, almost a skeletal mummy. There is a gaping wound in
   the victim's chest.]

     CSI TECH
     Pretty much the same as the other seven.

     SHEPPARD
     Same chest wound.

     CSI TECH
     Yeah.

   [Flashback theory shows the victim struggling with the killer in the
   car, yelling while the killer overpowers him and lays his right hand on
   the man's check. The victim's heart stops beating and withers into the
   husk shape...like after a human has been fed on by a Wraith.]

   [Sheppard re-covers the body and stands.]

     CSI TECH
     I thought I'd seen everything.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, me too. One day, we'll learn.

   [Sheppard walks back to his car. The Las Vegas Strip can be seen on the
   horizon.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--LAS VEGAS, DAY

   INT--LAS VEGAS POLICE MORGUE

   [The murder victim lies on a table. A coroner starts to autopsy the
   victim--the coroner is Keller. She wears heavier eye makeup than
   previously seen. Sheppard stands at the end of the table.]

     SHEPPARD
     Thomas Crane. Reported missing three days ago. Thirty-nine years
     old.

     KELLER
     You think this guy was thirty-nine?

     SHEPPARD
     Check the dental records. It wasn't natural causes.

     KELLER
     Nope. Looks like some kind of rapid cellular breakdown.

   [Sheppard moves to stand next to her.]

     SHEPPARD
     The other victims? They had the same chest wound. That same bizarre
     aging.

     KELLER

     (nodding)
     I read the other autopsies. Cause was undetermined. All I know is,
     we're not dealing with a contagion.

     SHEPPARD
     No chemical residue?

     KELLER

     (exasperated)
     Detective, you'll get a copy of my report.

   [Sheppard steps back, but doesn't leave.]

     SHEPPARD
     Previous victims all had radioactive residue around their...wounds.

     KELLER
     When I'm done.

     SHEPPARD
     What did you say your name was again?

   [She takes off her mask.]

     KELLER
     Keller...Jennifer.

     SHEPPARD
     I've got eight bodies in three months, and I don't like it when the
     lead coroner on my case gets replaced by someone who doesn't look
     old enough to be in medical school.

   [Keller shoots him an enigmatic smile.]

     KELLER
     Maybe someone feels the need for some fresh eyes on the case.

     SHEPPARD
     They should've just replaced me.

   [He heads to the door.]

     KELLER
     Do you have any leads?

     SHEPPARD
     I've got a bunch of bodies being dumped in the desert, and it looks
     like...the life's been sucked out of them.

     KELLER

     (cautiously)
     You really think that's possible?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know where you're from, but out here, anything's possible.

   [Sheppard leaves. Keller replaces her mask and gets back to work.]

   EXT--METROPOLITAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS, LAS VEGAS, DAY

   [2362 Point Boulevard.]

   INT--POLICE HEADQUARTERS

   [Sheppard heads down a staircase, talking on his cell phone.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into phone)
     Anyone treated with symptoms related to radiation poisoning. Go back
     a month...No, it's not going to come back to you. I promise.

   EXT--LAS VEGAS, NIGHT

   EXT--LUCKY ROLLERS MOTEL, NIGHT

   [The low-rate motel is crowded with several cars in front of their
   respective guests' doors. The motel is decorated with holiday lights on
   the trees in the landscaping.]

   INT--HOTEL ROOM

   [A man finishes vomiting in the room's toilet, flushing it and blowing
   his nose before returning to his bed, where the telephone receiver lies
   open. He picks it up. He looks pale and is shivering and feverish. His
   voice trembles weakly as he talks.]

     SICK GUY

     (into phone)
     Hi...I don't know. I told you. They said it was a virus or
     something. Probably food poisoning. You should see the place they've
     got me at. Not exactly Bellagio. The whole trip's been a useless
     waste of time, too.

   [He notices his nose is bleeding and grabs for a tissue.]

     SICK GUY
     Oh...oh! My nose is bleeding again! I'd better go!...Yeah, I will.
     Love you, too.

   [He hangs up the phone and lies back on the bed, holding pressure on
   his nose to stop the bleeding. He hears loud noises from the room
   adjoining his. Rolling his eyes, he pounds on the headboard.]

     SICK GUY

     (shouting)
     Turn it down, will ya?!

   [He stumbles to his feet and out of his room.]

     SICK GUY

     (mumbling)
     Son of a bitch.

   EXT--LUCKY ROLLER MOTEL, NIGHT

   [He heads over to Room 50 next door and pounds on the door. The music
   is very audible from the room. The tenant answers, flexing his Wraith
   feeding hand. The sick guy stares in horror at his neighbor.]

   INT--METROPOLITAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS

   [Sheppard works at his desk. His cheek bears a bruise. The same Johnny
   Cash poster that graces the Atlantis Sheppard's quarters in the Pegasus
   Galaxy hangs on the wall in this Sheppard's office. He studies crime
   scene photos as his supervisor and a suited Woolsey approach his door.
   Captain Hendricks knocks on the open door frame as he and Woolsey enter
   Sheppard's office.]

     HENDRICKS
     Sheppard? This is Agent Woolsey, FBI.

   [Woolsey puts out his hand to shake.]

     WOOLSEY
     Nice to meet you.

   [Sheppard stares at them both, but neither gets up nor accepts
   Woolsey's hand.]

     HENDRICKS
     What the hell happened to your eye?

     SHEPPARD
     Has this case moved jurisdiction?

     HENDRICKS
     Not yet.

     WOOLSEY
     I'm not at liberty to discuss our interest at this time, but I'd
     appreciate your cooperation.

   [Sheppard leans back in his chair.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well...I got nothin'.

     WOOLSEY
     I'm surprised at that, Detective. The victims are turning up much
     more frequently. This is obviously a progression.

     HENDRICKS
     The first few bodies were buried, and we only found them because
     coyotes dragged one onto the 564. Now, they're just being dumped out
     into the open for the vultures.

   [Sheppard receives a text message on his phone. He checks it while they
   still talk.]

     WOOLSEY
     So is that more careless, or more bold?

     SHEPPARD
     Somebody want to tell me why the coroner's report on the latest
     victim shows no signs of, radioactive, um, what do you call it?

     WOOLSEY
     Isotopes. I assume because there weren't any found.

   [Sheppard grabs his jacket as he stands.]

     SHEPPARD

     (challenging)
     Well...there were on the first seven.

   [He leaves. Woolsey watches him go with a worried expression.]

     HENDRICKS
     Where you goin'?

     SHEPPARD
     I've gotta go see a nurse.

   EXT--LAS VEGAS, DAY

   INT--HOSPITAL

   [A nurse shows Sheppard some medical records as they stand in the
   lobby.]

     NURSE
     Well, this guy was seen yesterday.

     SHEPPARD
     Where is he?

     NURSE
     Oh, he's an out-of-towner at a motel. The chart should say.

     SHEPPARD

     (incredulous)
     What, you-you just let him go?

     NURSE
     He was seen by a doctor. We get people in with flu-like symptoms all
     the time.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Well, what made him stand out?

     NURSE
     He was also having nosebleeds. Could've been unrelated, also common
     because of the dry air. But then you mentioned radiation
     poisoning...

   [Sheppard folds up the copy of the records and shifts restlessly.]

     SHEPPARD
     Thanks.

     NURSE

     (worried)
     Hey, look, if he really was exposed, it could be serious.

     SHEPPARD
     I'll track him down.

   [He moves to leave, but she blocks his path.]

     NURSE
     Um...do you want me to take a look at that...eye, John?

   [She circles the area on her own face. Sheppard gives a
   self-deprecating smile.]

     SHEPPARD
     No, no, I'm--I'm fine.

   [He walks away.]

     NURSE

     (calling after him)
     Hey! Uh...you gonna call me?

     SHEPPARD

     (absently)
     Yeah. Yeah, sure.

   INT--LUCKY ROLLER MOTEL OFFICE

   [Sheppard enters. He places a copy of the medical report with the man's
   driver's license on the counter in front of the clerk. He also sets his
   police badge down next to it.]

     SHEPPARD
     Do you know that guy?

     HOTEL MANAGER
     Checked out yesterday. Is that a medical report?

   [Sheppard folds up the paper and puts it back in his pocket, along with
   his badge.]

     SHEPPARD
     No.

     HOTEL MANAGER

     (worried)
     If he had something, I gotta know. Have that room cleaned up
     properly. Wash the sheets, you know?

     SHEPPARD

     (drily)
     Yeah. Wash those sheets. In the meantime, let me look at your
     register.

   [The man hands over the guest register. Sheppard scans the names.]

   INT--WRAITH'S MOTEL ROOM

   [Hard-rock music ("The Beautiful People" by Marilyn Manson) blares
   loudly as the Wraith, shirtless, stands before the dresser mirror. He
   applies cover-up make-up to his cheek slits. He also puts prosthetics
   on his forehead, ears, and teeth. He puts on other makeup and contact
   lenses over his reptilian eyes. When finished being dressed and
   coiffed, he looks human, albeit with a Goth fashion sense. He puts on
   dark sunglasses, walks past the husk of the sick guy's body, and exits
   his room.]

   EXT--LUCKY ROLLERS MOTEL, NIGHT

   [The Wraith heads to a truck with a silver motor home trailer hooked to
   it. From his own car, Sheppard watches the Wraith walk away.]

   EXT--LAS VEGAS, NIGHT

   [The Wraith walks unnoticed through the crowds in the city's nightlife,
   turning some heads. He walks near the Bellagio and its fountains. He
   enters Planet Hollywood. The Rolling Stones song "Sympathy for the
   Devil" plays as he walks.]

   INT--PLANET HOLLYWOOD CASINO

   [Several patrons are in the casino floor. Brad Wright sits at a table
   playing Blackjack. The Wraith passes the floor entertainments and makes
   his way to a private room game on the second floor.]

   INT--PRIVATE GAME ROOM

   [The Wraith sits at a table with several players in a high-stakes match
   of Texas Hold 'Em Poker. Two of the players know each other and chat as
   the game goes on.]

     MOE
     They were fighting. She tried to break it up. You know, it was an
     accident.

     MO'S FRIEND
     You couldn't find the finger?

     MO
     We were up all night looking for it.

     MO'S FRIEND
     Yeah, but you found it.

     MO

     (shrugging)
     Out on the lawn. When the sun came up. We got it in the fridge.

     MO'S FRIEND
     And where's the housekeeper?

     MO
     She's at the hospital. She lost a ton of blood.

     MO'S FRIEND
     Really? Don't they need the finger?

     MO
     Nah. It was too late to re-attach it. She'll be all right.

   [A couple people fold before the flop, where the dealer displays the
   five of diamonds, four of spades and ace of diamonds.]

     MO'S FRIEND
     What finger was it?

     MO

     (waving his pinky finger)
     Pinky.

     MO'S FRIEND

     (incredulous)
     And you still got it?

     MO

     (shrugging)
     Hey, what are you supposed to do with a finger? Besides, we thought
     maybe she'd still want it. You know?

   [The poker player folds. Mo checks. The Wraith raises. Another player
   folds.]

     MO'S FRIEND
     Hey, what about the dogs?

     MO
     What about them?

     MO'S FRIEND
     You gotta get rid of 'em, no?

     MO

     Whaddya mean? I love those dogs!
     (nodding to dealer)
     I know. I'll see him.

   [He places chips into the pot. The Wraith shows his hand. Mo scowls and
   tosses away his hand (apparently the turn and river of the hand
   happened while the conversation continued).]

     MO

     (to Wraith)
     Nice hand, huh? Got me again! It's almost like you can read minds,
     huh?

     MO'S FRIEND
     Only yours.

     MO
     Look at this guy. He won't even look at me. You've been taking my
     money all night; you won't even look at me?!

   [Sheppard has entered the area and is frisked by the bodyguard at the
   door before being allowed to go down the short hallway into the room.]

     MO'S FRIEND
     Come on, Mo. Leave it alone. He's a freakin' wacko.

   [Sheppard sits at the table.]

     MO

     (to Sheppard)
     Aren't you a little out of your league here?

     SHEPPARD

     (surly)
     What are you, my mother?
     (to dealer)
     Go ahead. I'll ante.

   [The dealer starts dealing out hold cards to all the players.
   Sheppard's seat is directly across from the Wraith. They stare at each
   other.]

   [Play continues for several hands. The Wraith most often wins.]

   [On one hand, Sheppard ends up with a pair of sixes (hearts and
   diamonds). He stares at the Wraith. The Wraith raises and Sheppard
   calls. The deal of the flop shows a six of spades, and two sevens.
   Sheppard now has a full house. The Wraith raises again, and Sheppard
   calls. The turn card is another seven. Sheppard studies his hand, then
   stares at the Wraith, who raises again.]

     DEALER
     Twenty-two thousand to call.

   [Everyone watches with interest. Mo licks his lips.]

     MO

     (to Sheppard, about the Wraith)
     He doesn't have it.

     MO'S FRIEND
     Shut up.

   [Sheppard folds. The Wraith takes the pot. Sheppard licks his lips. Mo
   shakes his head in irritation.]

     MO
     He didn't have it. No way.

   [The Wraith stands.]

     MO
     Wait, where you goin? You can't leave now. Look at this guy! Hey!

   [He grabs the Wraith's arm. The Wraith twists it and shoves the guy
   back with supernatural strength. He roars. Mo falls back into a glass
   table. The cocktail waitress screams. Sheppard stands and the Wraith
   climbs over the table and attacks him next, pushing him to the floor
   before attacking one of the bodyguards. Sheppard is still stunned from
   the force of the blow as the Wraith runs down the short hallway. The
   bodyguard there aims his gun but the Wraith diverts his aim as the gun
   fires several times. He knocks that bodyguard away and opens the door
   as Sheppard finally scrambles to his feet and gives chase, grabbing the
   bodyguard's abandoned gun on his way out the door.]

   INT--CASINO

   [Sheppard chases the Wraith through the hallways and down a stairwell.
   The Wraith leaps down levels at a time. They run through a kitchen, the
   Wraith knocking carts of dishes into Sheppard's path to delay him. ]

   EXT--CASINO ROOF

   [The Wraith ends up on a casino roof, Sheppard still close behind. He
   finally reaches the edge and as Sheppard watches leaps over. He falls,
   still making a running motion, many stories and something like 200 feet
   to the ground. Horrified, Sheppard leans over the edge and sees the
   flattened body far below. As he watches in shock, the Wraith struggles
   to his feet and looks up. It limps away, gradually gaining momentum. By
   the time he has reached the end of the alleyway, he's running as if in
   full health.]

   INT--WRAITH'S MOTEL ROOM

   [The hotel manager lets Sheppard into the room, where they instantly
   spot the sick guy's body.]

     HOTEL MANAGER
     Oh, geez!

   [Sheppard steps in and crouches by the body.]

     HOTEL MANAGER
     You don't think that's contagious, do you?

     SHEPPARD
     You said the guy next door checked out yesterday?

     HOTEL MANAGER
     I never saw him. He used the t.v.

   [Sheppard flashes his light up to where the manager is leaning on the
   doorframe.]

     SHEPPARD
     Don't touch anything.

   [The manager straightens off the doorframe.]

     HOTEL MANAGER
     Sure.

   [Sheppard looks around the rest of the room. In a bag on the bed is a
   large amount of cash.]

     HOTEL MANAGER

     (straining to see the contents)
     What is it?

     SHEPPARD
     It's a crime scene. Get lost.

   [The man leaves.]

   EXT--LUCKY ROLLER MOTEL PARKING LOT

   [Sheppard puts the bag of money in his trunk. He notices the empty
   space next to his car has a radiator stain, still wet. A flashback
   reminds him of the leak at the crime scene and how the killer's vehicle
   was thought to have that leak. Three SUVs pull into the parking lot.
   Woolsey exits the rear passenger side of the middle one.]

     WOOLSEY
     Detective?

     SHEPPARD

     (nervously)
     We've got another body here. I was just about to call it in.

     WOOLSEY
     I heard about what happened at the casino.

     SHEPPARD
     You following me?

     WOOLSEY
     There's a satellite locator on your car. If you don't mind, we'd
     like you to come for a little drive.

     SHEPPARD
     Do I have a choice?

   [Woolsey winces.]

     SHEPPARD
     Right.

   [He gets in the car with Woolsey.]

   EXT--AREA 51, DAY

   [The SUVs drive to nondescript buildings in an otherwise empty area of
   the Nevada desert.]

   INT--AREA 51 HALLWAY

   [Woolsey stands outside a holding room. Through the window in the door,
   he looks at Sheppard standing in the back of that room. McKay, dressed
   in an upscale suit and with nicely coiffed hair, approaches Woolsey.
   McKay's demeanor is much more professional and less neurotic than the
   Atlantis McKay, and he speaks more slowly.]

     WOOLSEY
     He won't sign.

     MCKAY
     Well, we should tell him anyway.

     WOOLSEY
     We can't trust him.

     MCKAY
     He might be able to help us. I'm going to at least try.

   [McKay enters the room.]

   INT--SHEPPARD'S HOLDING ROOM

   [Sheppard stands on the opposite side of a large table from McKay.
   McKay tosses a tablet computer onto the table.]

     MCKAY
     Detective? I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. I realize that you have no way
     of grasping what's going on here. There's really only one thing you
     need to understand. If you fail to cooperate, I have the power to
     ruin your life.

     SHEPPARD
     You don't realize how little I have to lose.

     MCKAY
     I know everything about you. You've never been married. The only
     thing you own is a car. You have $2,363.00 in the bank and are
     $13,000.00 in debt...not counting the off-the-books gambling losses
     to a guy named "Mikey."

   [Sheppard swallows nervously.]

     MCKAY

     (smug)
     What else? You finally passed your detective exam after four years
     and two failed attempts...

   [Sheppard rolls his eyes and mumbles to himself.]

     MCKAY
     ...and now barely scrape by on quarterly performance reviews. Am I
     getting this right?

     SHEPPARD
     I also like spearmint gum.

   [McKay tosses a pack of spearmint gum on the table.]

     MCKAY
     Have some.

     SHEPPARD
     I was joking.

     MCKAY
     No, you weren't.

   [He frowns and crosses the table to stand directly in front of
   Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     Let's go back further, shall we? You were a helicopter pilot in
     Afghanistan, but were dishonorably discharged for disobeying orders
     and trying to rescue a field medic trapped behind enemy lines. You
     were shot down--obviously survived, but unfortunately the crash
     killed four American soldiers, along with eight civilians.

   [Sheppard shuffles, obviously upset.]

     MCKAY
     You avoided jail time. The record was sealed for various "political
     reasons." These things happen, right?

   [McKay sneers as he steps away, turning his back on Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     Somehow, you've managed to live with yourself since then, but I'm
     not sure other people would if they knew the truth.

     SHEPPARD

     (feigning indifference)
     I don't really care.

     MCKAY

     (sadly)
     Yeah. That's too bad.

   [Sheppard sits at the table and grabs a stick of gum as McKay heads for
   the door. McKay pauses and turns back.]

     MCKAY
     You know...I once met another version of you. He was very different.

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     MCKAY
     Nothing is what you think it is.

     SHEPPARD
     That really doesn't come as a surprise to me.

   [McKay sits across from him.]

     MCKAY
     Look...we're not bad guys. We just want to keep the planet safe.

     SHEPPARD

     (caustic)
     I doubt that very much.

     MCKAY
     I don't expect you'll believe me at first. I'm about to tell you
     some incredible things: wormhole travel through a device called a
     Stargate, ancient races of humans on other planets, other dimensions
     in space and time, even infinite variations of our own, known
     reality, where alternate versions of you and I play out events in
     ways you can't...possibly imagine.

     SHEPPARD

     (scoffing)
     Space aliens?

   [He smiles at McKay, who continues to look deadly serious. Sheppard's
   smile falters.]

   INT--WRAITH TRAILER

   [The Wraith sits despondently on the trailer cot. Part of his "human"
   make-up has fallen off, but some of the prosthetics remain.]

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--SPACE, EARTH ORBIT

   [Darts dogfight F-302s above Earth. Ancient drones destroy the hive
   ship. The Wraith snarls in the cockpit of his ship as he loses control;
   his dart falls towards the atmosphere, heading towards North America.]

   END FLASHBACK

   [Throughout the flashback, the Wraith becomes more and more agitated as
   he remembers the trauma.]

   INT--AREA 51, CHAIR ROOM

   [Sheppard stares at the Antarctic Ancient chair. McKay joins him.]

     MCKAY
     It was found under a mile of ice in Antarctica five years ago and
     later moved here. It runs on a power source that extracts energy
     from vacuum space. We call it a "ZedPM"...well, "ZeePM". Sorry, I'm
     Canadian. If you have the right genetic code, it allows you to
     control some pretty cool weaponry remotely with your mind. That's
     how we were able to defeat the Wraith hive ship that attacked Earth
     three months ago.

     SHEPPARD

     (hoarsely)
     Are there more?

     MCKAY
     What? Chairs?

     SHEPPARD
     No. Aliens.

     MCKAY
     Oh yeah. Lots more. Fortunately, they're in another galaxy--and for
     now, don't know where Earth is.

   [He walks towards the exit. Sheppard continues to stare at the chair,
   overwhelmed.]

     MCKAY
     Detective?

   [Sheppard follows McKay out, never having touched the chair.]

   INT--AREA 51 WAREHOUSE ROOM

   [McKay and Sheppard stand on a balcony overlooking a warehouse floor
   full of half-a-dozen wreckages of darts.]

     MCKAY
     They're called darts--small, fast, single-pilot attack ships. We're
     lucky we took out the hive as quickly as we did. Each one can carry
     hundreds of these things.

     SHEPPARD
     And the guy dumping bodies in the desert?

     MCKAY
     Is an alien...a Wraith--genetic hybrid between human beings and
     something called an Iratus bug. It feeds on human energy--literally
     saps the life out of people using a sucker on their hands. I suppose
     it all sounds like science fiction to you.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not really a fan.

   INT--AREA 51 CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard and McKay walk down a corridor. Military sentries line the
   corridor.]

     MCKAY
     My team and I usually operate out of Atlantis in the Pegasus Galaxy,
     but we were called back to Earth to deal with this situation because
     of our expertise with the Wraith. Now, the one that you've
     encountered has obviously been doing a fairly good job of blending
     in.

     SHEPPARD
     What, disguising himself as a human?

     MCKAY
     Based on your description and the video surveillance from the
     casino.

     SHEPPARD
     What do they normally look like?

   [McKay runs a keycard by a sentried door. It opens.]

     MCKAY
     Normally...they look like that.

   [Sheppard stares in horror at a Wraith in a glass cell. It is "Todd",
   but he looks unkempt and manic.]

   INT--OUTSIDE WRAITH CELL

     SHEPPARD
     Why do they do it?

     MCKAY
     You mean feed on humans? That's just what they are. We're
     just...cattle to them.

     TODD
     Fish in a pond. Busy, busy. Lots to do, here and there.

     MCKAY
     This one fancies himself a bit of a poet...not good.

     TODD
     Dry as a desert outside. No place to go.

     MCKAY
     He's also delirious from starvation.

     TODD
     Eat up! Get stronger! Think, and hope. Think...and hope. Don't look
     now! Oh, keep dreaming. There must be some other reason for your
     existence.

   [He focuses on Sheppard as he talks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Didn't you get anything from him?

     MCKAY
     Nothing. And believe me we've tried...everything.

     TODD

     Defiance tastes like life itself. No river. No water. Die in the
     desert. Darkness all around. The harvest moon is rising. Wraith are
     never-ending.
     (he gets closer to the wall in front of Sheppard)
     I know the future. Come inside...I'll show you...your destiny, John
     Sheppard!

   [Sheppard appears frozen in place.]

     MCKAY
     They can get in your head.

   [Sheppard snaps out of it and follows McKay out.]

   INT--AREA 51 CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard catches his breath outside the room, looking rattled.]

     MCKAY
     You okay?

   [Sheppard nods.]

     SHEPPARD
     Are people ever going to know the truth?

     MCKAY

     (scoffing)
     It's not my decision. Personally, I think people choose to live in
     their own happy little delusions. They don't really want to know the
     truth.

   [Keller walks by, smiling at McKay as she passes. McKay watches her
   pass with interest.]

     MCKAY
     Jennifer.

     KELLER
     Rodney.

   [Sheppard looks nonplussed his "coroner" is in the facility. He follows
   McKay down the corridor in the other direction from Keller.]

     SHEPPARD
     Did...the other victims had radioactive residue on them?

     MCKAY
     They all did. Once we got wind of it and our suspicions were
     confirmed, the whole thing was ultimately going to be covered up.
     But you tracked down the target before that could happen.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, in serial cases, you're supposed to look for any victims who
     got away.

     MCKAY
     Which is how you found the motel and the man who reported radiation
     sickness. He was most likely exposed 'cause he was in the room next
     door to the Wraith. See, we didn't think to look for bystanders that
     could've been accidentally exposed due the proximity.

     SHEPPARD
     To the alien?

     MCKAY
     No, no. However, we do believe that the radioactive material in this
     case is being transferred from the target to the victims. But the
     source, mmm, it's been shielded from our scanning capabilities.

   [He looks concerned. Sheppard notices.]

     SHEPPARD
     What is it?

     MCKAY

     (hesitating a moment)
     Look, we know that the Wraith don't need to feed as often as the
     target does. I mean they feed for pleasure, but not in this case.
     Not if it means leaving a trail behind.

     SHEPPARD
     Some other reason...?

     MCKAY
     If they're sick or injured, they can regenerate, but it requires
     energy. We believe that the target is unavoidably exposing himself
     to high doses of radiation and is having to eat to counteract the
     effects.

     SHEPPARD
     What's the source?

     MCKAY
     He's building a device. We're not sure of its intended function, but
     we know that he was able to...salvage certain parts from his crashed
     dart before we could get to it.

     SHEPPARD
     Well,...wh-what about the rest?

     MCKAY
     The Wraith are smart. It wouldn't take him long to learn the ins and
     outs of the way things work around here. We have reason to believe
     that he has already acquired some of the necessary materials, but he
     needs more. He also needs untraceable currency, or we would've found
     him by now.

     SHEPPARD
     So he makes money playing poker. There's got to be a better way than
     that.

     MCKAY
     Well, I guess he could rob a bank, but it's risky, and it draws a
     lot of attention. No, the Wraith love...games. And with their mental
     abilities, they are very good at them.

   [In the room at the end of the corridor where McKay and Sheppard are,
   Zelenka briefs a room full of people. His appearance is not disheveled,
   but instead, he too is sharply dressed. He does not wear glasses.]

     ZELENKA

     (from inside room)
     The following is a worst-case scenario...should the device be
     detonated.

   [McKay looks irritated.]

     MCKAY

     (to Sheppard)
     Excuse me. Wait here.

   INT--CONFERENCE ROOM

     ZELENKA

     (to group)
     Now, based on the material we suspect has already gone into the
     core, there's a very strong likelihood.

   [McKay strides in angrily, his demeanor now similar to the familiar
   Atlantis version.]

     MCKAY
     It's not a bomb!

     ZELENKA

     (sighing, trying to ignore McKay)
     We need to be prepared for every possibility.

     MCKAY
     What would be the point in cooking over half of the United States?

     ZELENKA
     Revenge.

     MCKAY
     Not his first choice. He wants to send up a flare signaling the
     location of Earth to the rest of the Wraith.

     ZELENKA

     (to group)
     Excuse me.

   [He steps over to McKay. They begin arguing in low tones, but the
   voices are loud enough the rest of the room, including Sheppard by the
   door, can hear them.]

     ZELENKA

     (patiently)
     Rodney, he would not need that kind of power to activate a Wraith
     communicator.

     MCKAY
     He does if he wants to send the message to Pegasus and be rescued in
     his lifetime.

     ZELENKA
     But that would require a massive boost.

     MCKAY
     Yes! It would require more energy than he has now.

     ZELENKA
     And not even a ZPM...

     MCKAY

     (interrupting)
     I know!

     ZELENKA
     That kind of burst is uncontrollable.

     MCKAY
     Look, I never said it wasn't dangerous. It could open up any number
     of anomalies.

     ZELENKA

     (snarking)
     Like the interdimensional rift?

     MCKAY
     Look, will you stop bringing that up?! Why do you have to constantly
     remind me, especially in front of other people?!

     ZELENKA
     You are such a child!

     MCKAY
     And yet, I am still smarter than you!

   [McKay walks away, piqued. Zelenka stares at the abrupt leaving in
   shock, mouth agape, hands on hips. McKay gestures for Sheppard to
   follow as he leaves the room.]

     MCKAY

     (to Sheppard)
     Don't worry, everything's under control.

   EXT--AREA 51, DAY

   [McKay and Sheppard stand by some military vehicles. A suited man waits
   by an SUV.]

     MCKAY
     Thank you for your cooperation, Detective. If you think of anything
     else, call me at this number.

   [He hands Sheppard a business card. Sheppard studies the card,
   pensive.]

     SHEPPARD
     If he's not finished yet, why'd he stop hiding bodies?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. Overconfidence that he can't be caught?

   [Sheppard taps the card against his hand, considering.]

     SHEPPARD
     He left money behind.

     MCKAY

     (intrigued)
     How much?

     SHEPPARD

     (reluctantly)
     A few thousand?

     MCKAY

     (chuckling)
     Not enough to worry about, I guess.

     SHEPPARD

     (quietly)
     That's it? You're just going to let me go?

     MCKAY
     That field medic...the one you defied orders to go back and try and
     rescue...you knew her personally. You were...involved.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you know everything.

     MCKAY

     (pensively)
     It's a hard choice. Certainly, you didn't intend things to go as
     badly as they did. Things just don't always go the way we plan... We
     know where to find you.

   [Sheppard starts to leave. A jet flies overhead, loudly.]

     MCKAY
     Detective?

   [Sheppard stops. McKay approaches him.]

     MCKAY
     Remember when I told you I once met another version of you?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

     MCKAY
     I know you'll probably think this sounds ridiculous, but, uh, a
     little while ago we accidentally opened a rift in space-time--went
     through to an alternate version of reality. It was very similar to
     ours in many ways. We met a team, much like the one I work with,
     only...you were the leader. You were a hero--saved the world several
     times over.

     SHEPPARD
     Doesn't sound much like me.

     MCKAY
     I don't think there's much difference between you...and that other
     John Sheppard I met. It's amazing how one incident can entirely
     alter the course of your life. Still, I like to believe you have the
     same strength of character. That's why I told you the truth.

   [McKay walks away.]

     SHEPPARD

     (calling after him)
     What do you want me to say?

     MCKAY

     (not breaking stride)
     For now? Nothing.

   EXT--METROPOLITAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS, DAY

   INT--SHEPPARD'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard packs up his personal effects into a box. He rolls up his
   Johnny Cash poster and sets it on top. His badge and gun remain on the
   desk. Captain Hendricks enters.]

     HENDRICKS
     What's going on?

   [Sheppard hands him the box, then pulls out the poster and walks out
   with it, not looking back.]

   EXT--NEVADA ROAD, DAY

   [Sheppard drives in his car down the highway. He turns on the radio and
   listens to Johnny Cash's Solitary Man. While driving he glances down to
   the bag of cash sitting on the seat beside him. Then he thinks about
   the events he's learned in the last few days in a series of
   flashbacks.]

   FLASHBACK

     MCKAY
     It feeds on human energy--literally saps the life out of people
     using a sucker on their hands.

   [The Wraith victim corpse lies in the desert.]

     TODD

     (voiceover)
     Dry as a desert outside.

   [The Wraith falls several stories.]

     TODD

     (voiceover)
     No place to go.

     MCKAY
     He wants to send up a flare signaling the location of Earth to the
     rest of the Wraith.

     TODD
     Wraith are never-ending. I know the future.

     ZELENKA
     But that would require a massive boost.

     MCKAY
     Yes! He needs more power than he has!

     TODD
     I'll show you your destiny, John Sheppard.

   [The corpse lies in the desert.]

   [Antifreeze is on the desert floor.]

   [Sheppard finds the money.]

   [There is an antifreeze puddle in the motel parking lot.]

   [Sheppard imagines the fluid leaking from the killer's vehicle.]

   [Sheppard watches the Wraith walk towards a trailer from his stakeout
   point.]

   END FLASHBACKS

   [Sheppard sharply spins the car around and heads back the way he came
   at high speed.]

   INT--AREA 51 WAR ROOM

   [Zelenka types at a computer while McKay briefs Woolsey behind him.]

     MCKAY
     Recalibrating the scanners to look for similar isotopes at maximum
     sensitivity just shows us huge patches of radioactive desert.

     WOOLSEY
     From forty-year-old nuclear testing.

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, we're talking about hundreds of square miles.

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     It's like a needle in a haystack.

     ZELENKA
     Or he could've abandoned whatever resources he had and just gone
     into hiding.

     MCKAY

     (scornfully)
     Oh, yes. He probably got a job as a Klingon at Star Trek: The
     Experience.

     WOOLSEY

     (sadly)
     That shut down.

     ZELENKA

     (disappointed)
     Really? Damn. I wanted to see that.

   [Harriman approaches.]

     HARRIMAN
     Doctor McKay, there's a call for you. John Sheppard.

   [McKay scrambles for a phone.]

     MCKAY

     (into phone)
     Hello?

     SHEPPARD

     (over phone)
     I found him.

     MCKAY

     (to others)
     He thinks he's found him!
     (into phone)
     How?

   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DAY

   [The conversation continues between McKay's location and Sheppard,
   where he's speaking on his cell phone.]

   [Sheppard looks at a trailer sitting below large power lines.]

     SHEPPARD
     I remembered the trailer from the motel. It's one of those old
     Silver Bullets. It's just a hunch. You said he needed more power.
     So, I drove along some of the more remote power lines into the city.

   INT--AREA 51 WAR ROOM

   [McKay snaps at Harriman.]

     MCKAY

     (to Harriman)
     Harriman, he's going to tap into the grid.

   [Harriman moves to a terminal.]

     WOOLSEY

     (to Harriman)
     We should have John Sheppard's coordinates.

   INT--WRAITH TRAILER

   [The Wraith sits at a combination of Wraith and Earth technology. He
   types on a keyboard, then moves one lever, powering something. He has
   repaired his make-up and appears semi-human again.]

   INT--AREA 51 WAR ROOM

     MCKAY

     (into phone, concerned and insistent)
     Listen to me. I know what I said, but do not engage. Do you hear me?

   [He only hears static. He stares worriedly at the phone.]

   INT--SHEPPARD'S CAR

   [Sheppard hears static. He checks his cell phone and sees the display
   reads "No Service".]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, crap.

   INT--WRAITH TRAILER

   [The Wraith activates more controls.]

   EXT--NEVADA SKY, DAY

   [Two A-10 Thunderbolt (aka Warthog) ground attack aircraft, already
   airborne, turn sharply back toward Sheppard's location.]

   INT--AREA 51 WAR ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     ETA to target...three minutes.

   INT--WRAITH TRAILER

   [The Wraith powers another lever.]

   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DAY

   [Sheppard slowly drives toward the trailer.]

   INT--WRAITH TRAILER

   [The Wraith hears Sheppard approach. He goes to a closet.]

   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DAY

   [Sheppard opens his glovebox and pulls out a pistol, checking the
   magazine is loaded and cocking the gun. He gets out of the car and
   cautiously approaches. A shot comes through the window. Sheppard looks
   down; he has been shot in the left upper chest. He turns and runs for
   cover behind his car. More automatic weapon fire riddles the car.
   Sheppard empties his gun at the trailer, then scrambles for a spare
   magazine in the glove box. The Wraith exits the trailer, automatic
   rifles in each hand. Sheppard continues to shoot, hitting the Wraith
   but having no effect on him. Sheppard eventually collapses, sitting up
   against the tire, his torso bloody from the bullet wound. The Wraith
   rounds the vehicle. Sheppard half-heartedly tries to fire, but his gun
   has been long emptied. The Wraith drops his guns and flexes his feeding
   hand, which is gloved. Sheppard resignedly takes off his glasses. The
   A-10 jets approach. The Wraith sees them and runs back to his trailer.]

   INT--WRAITH TRAILER

   [Panicked, the Wraith activates his controls to full force.]

   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DAY

   [Sheppard looks around as if trying to see what's going on. An energy
   pulse emanates outward from the trailer and across the desert.]

   INT--AREA 51 WAR ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     We have widespread power outages being reported across the state.

     ZELENKA
     Daedalus is transmitting new sensor data.

     MCKAY
     Got it! Massive subspace event. Ten times the size of power of an
     active Stargate and getting stronger. The scope increases the longer
     it stays active.

     WOOLSEY
     What is it?

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     It's a transmission...coded in Wraith. I'm working on it.

     HARRIMAN

     (to Woolsey)
     Target has been acquired, sir.

     WOOLSEY
     Take it out.

   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DAY

   [The A-10s swoop low over the trailer, firing their 30mm nose-mounted
   gatling guns at it. Inside the trailer, the Wraith screams his
   defiance. The weapons fire hits the target. The trailer explodes while
   Sheppard stays in the semi-protected cover of his car. The jets turn
   sharply and fly away.]

   INT--AREA 51 WAR ROOM

     HARRIMAN

     (excited)
     We have a direct hit! Target has been neutralized.

     ZELENKA
     Transmission has ceased.

     MCKAY

     (disturbed)
     It contained the location of Earth.

     WOOLSEY
     Is there a chance it reached Pegasus?

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     No.

     ZELENKA
     Rodney, I've seen this energy signature before.

     MCKAY
     I know. It looks like the device tore a small hole in the space-time
     continuum.

     WOOLSEY
     Do you think that was intended?

     MCKAY
     No. It couldn't have been. Most of the energy meant to carry the
     Wraith transmission went through the rift.

     WOOLSEY
     To where?

     ZELENKA
     Well, there's no way to know for sure.

     MCKAY
     Other realities.

     WOOLSEY

     (sighing)
     I'm sorry, but I only care about us right now.

     MCKAY
     If John Sheppard hadn't found that Wraith when he did, that
     transmission definitely would've made it through to Pegasus. He
     saved our asses.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but that transmission would've been stronger in any other
     reality exposed to the rift.

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     They could be in a lot of trouble right now.

   EXT--NEVADA DESERT, DUSK

   [Debris from the trailer explosion litters the area, some still on
   fire. Sheppard stumbles away from his car and tries to walk, but only
   gets a few steps before collapsing. He rolls onto his back, grimaces
   for a moment, then relaxes as if resigned to dying. He lies staring at
   the sky as Johnny Cash's "Solitary Man" plays.]
