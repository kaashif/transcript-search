   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [A Wraith walks down the corridor.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [The Wraith enters, raises its hand, and starts to feed on Teyla. She
   wakes and tries to fight it off. Suddenly it disappears. Teyla wakes
   from the seeming nightmare, shaken. She rushes out of her quarters.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Teyla rushes through the corridor to the door to Sheppard's quarters.]

     TEYLA
     Major Sheppard. Major!

   [She activates the controls and enters. Sheppard is covered by
   blankets. She throws them back, revealing a Sheppard that's been fed
   upon by Wraith and is now aged and dead. Teyla gasps and turns to face
   the Wraith.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla wakens from the nightmare and sits up more slowly. Her skin
   glistens with sweat.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS EXERCISE ROOM

   [Teyla and Sheppard spar with Athosian fighting sticks. Sheppard gets
   the best of her after a parry, and they regroup and start again.
   Sheppard hits Teyla and seems surprised by that.]

     TEYLA
     Ah! Continue.

     SHEPPARD
     Going easy on me, huh?

     TEYLA
     I assure you, Major, I am not. Continue.

   [They spar again. Sheppard throws Teyla to the floor.]

     SHEPPARD
     You okay?

     TEYLA
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD
     Are you sure? Because it's usually me picking my butt up off the
     mat.

     TEYLA
     Truthfully, I have not been sleeping much. And when I do, I've been
     having nightmares about the Wraith.

   [He helps her up.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you're not the only one.

     TEYLA
     It has not been so bad since my father was taken.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Weir briefs the staff.]

     WEIR
     According to Dr. Zelenka's calculations, we have less than one week
     before the Wraith arrive. I want options.

     MCKAY
     You mean besides crying ourselves to sleep? Well, not me. I haven't
     slept in days.

     WEIR
     And what do you have to show for your sleepless nights, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Since we got here, we've uncovered a number of defensive weapons
     systems beyond the shield--

     ZELENKA
     We think our best option is the control chair.

     MCKAY
     I was going to say that.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but you were taking too long, as usual.

     MCKAY
     Yes, but the point is this may not be our best chance.

     ZELENKA
     Name a better one.

     WEIR
     Gentlemen.

     MCKAY
     Of course, like the shield, power will be our biggest problem.

     ZELENKA
     We haven't even been able to initialize the chair yet, much less
     determine whether we can meet the power requirements to run it.

     WEIR
     Okay. Keep me posted. Sergeant Bates, where are we with our Alpha
     site?

     BATES
     We've completed the ground and aerial security sweep and are ready
     to begin establishing base camp. We're just awaiting final
     inspection by Major Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD
     Right after lunch.

     WEIR
     Good. Teyla, are the Athosians getting prepared for an evacuation?

     TEYLA
     Yes, but many believe there is no other world that is safe from the
     Wraith.

     WEIR
     They want to stay?

     TEYLA
     As we have heard from our allies and seen for ourselves, there are
     cullings happening all over the galaxy. My people have spent their
     lives hiding from the Wraith.

     WEIR
     Yes, well, the difference here being we do intend to destroy the
     city rather than let it fall into the hands of the Wraith. And, if
     it comes to that, anyone left on the mainland will be cut off from
     the Stargate for good. Now, thanks to Rodney's discovery of the
     gate's control crystal, we at least know we'll be able to take that
     with us and hopefully use it to access Earth again some time in the
     future.

     TEYLA
     We understand that, Dr. Weir.

     WEIR
     I'm sorry, I--

     TEYLA
     I am merely saying that the people of Athos wish you to know that if
     we are going to stay and fight, they too will help defend the city
     of the Ancestors.

     WEIR
     Well, that is very honorable, but I--

     KAVANAUGH
     Oh, please! We can't possibly consider staying and fighting.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I disagree. I think it's entirely within the realm of
     possibility.

     KAVANAUGH
     There are tens of thousands of life-sucking aliens in highly
     advanced spaceships on their way here to destroy us and we have
     what, two hundred people, most of whom are scientists who've never
     even fired a gun before?

     MCKAY
     Shockingly, for the first time ever, I find myself having to agree
     with Kavanaugh.

     SHEPPARD
     All I'm saying is let's not give up...just yet.

     MCKAY
     What was that we were supposed to all remember? Something important.
     Oh, yes, that's right--the Alamo.

     SHEPPARD
     Granted, you guys are scientists. No one's considering putting you
     guys on the front line, but science can turn the tide of war. Look
     at the...A-bomb.

     ZELENKA
     Not exactly our proudest moment.

     WEIR
     The fact is, the Wraith aren't here quite yet, and until that
     moment, I would like everyone to remain focused on what it is they
     do best. Like I said off the top, if there are any options, I want
     them. That's all.

   INT--MESS HALL

   [Teyla sits at a table with a tray of food. Heightmeyer approaches.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Teyla?

     TEYLA
     Hi.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Kate...Heightmeyer.

     TEYLA
     Yes. Right. I knew that. I'm sorry.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     No problem. Mind if I join you?

     TEYLA
     No, of course not.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Strange how the memory just goes away when we're tired.

     TEYLA
     You are a doctor, right?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Psychologist, actually.

     TEYLA
     And that is different than Dr. Beckett?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Quite, yes. Um, I deal with the mind. I try and help people deal
     with emotional problems like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic
     distress. Well, needless to say, I've been pretty busy since we got
     here.

     TEYLA
     I can imagine.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     I'm sure that you do a lot of the same things that I do for your
     people, but it must be very hard on you, always having to keep such
     a brave face.

     TEYLA
     From strength comes hope. Without hope, my people would be lost.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     You must feel you have to be outwardly strong for us, as well.
     Teyla, I know that your value and your loyalty have been questioned
     by a few here in the past. What I'm trying to say to you is if you
     ever need to talk, I'm here.

     TEYLA
     Did Major Sheppard ask you to speak with me?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Yes, he may have--

     TEYLA
     I'm sorry. I do not mean to be rude, but I'm fine. Really. I
     appreciate your concern.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GATEROOM

   [Teyla finds Sheppard.]

     TEYLA
     Major.

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla.

     TEYLA
     What did you tell Dr. Heightmeyer?

     SHEPPARD
     Exactly what you told me. That you couldn't sleep because you were
     having nightmares.

     TEYLA
     I confided in you.

     SHEPPARD
     You're a member of my team, which makes you my responsibility, And I
     only told one person, whose job, by the way, is to deal exactly with
     this sort of thing.

     TEYLA
     There is nothing wrong with my mind.

     SHEPPARD
     Nobody said there was.

     TEYLA

     (angry)
     I have a hard enough time getting your people to respect me without
     them thinking I'm crazy.

     SHEPPARD
     Nobody thinks you're crazy, and everybody respects you.

     TEYLA
     That is not the point.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, Teyla, you may want to sit this one out.

     TEYLA
     What do you mean?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, Rodney's staying back, and Ford and I are just going to check
     out the Alpha site one last time before we have to move in.

     TEYLA
     Should we evacuate, my people will be forced to that planet as well.

     SHEPPARD
     And I'll make sure it's safe for everyone. Look, Teyla, I'm not
     saying there's anything wrong with you, God forbid, but you yourself
     admitted that you were a little off your game. You snapped at Dr.
     Weir this morning in the briefing room for no good reason. Now
     you're biting my head off for caring that you might need help
     dealing with the fact that it's been three days since you've had any
     sleep.

     TEYLA
     I'm sorry, but I do not need any help. The Wraith are coming. What I
     need is to do something!

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. Good. I suggest you take a nap.

   [Sheppard walks into the Gate room. Frustrated, Teyla heads the other
   way.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Having taken off her gear, Teyla lies down on her bed. After a moment
   she sighs and gets up.]

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

   [Teyla comes to Heightmeyer's office. McKay is standing in the
   doorway.]

     MCKAY
     Teyla.

     TEYLA

     (surprised)
     Dr. McKay.

     MCKAY

     (uncomfortable)
     I was just, um...
     (secretively)
     We're seeing each other.

     TEYLA
     You and Dr. Heightmeyer?

     MCKAY
     Well, you know how much I love women with great, um...minds. Just
     don't say anything to anyone.

     TEYLA
     Your secret is safe with me.

     MCKAY
     Right. Very good. Excellent.

   [McKay walks away.]

     TEYLA
     Dr. Heightmeyer?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Teyla. Come in.

     TEYLA
     I'm sorry to bother you. Is it all right if I...

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Of course. Please, have a seat.

     TEYLA
     I guess I'm not really sure how this is supposed to work.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Just relax. Tell me whatever's on your mind.

     TEYLA
     I have been having bad dreams. I feel... Everyone on this base is
     probably afraid. I do not know why I'm bothering you--

   [She gets up to leave.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Have you always been able to sense the Wraith?

     TEYLA
     Yes. Since I can remember.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Well, what does it feel like?

   [Teyla sits back down.]

     TEYLA
     It feels like a deep cold that comes from within. I first felt it
     when I was a girl. I could not breathe, and I did not know why. And
     then we heard the darts.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Do you feel that way now?

     TEYLA
     I have had a knot inside me for some time now.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     As I understand, though, their ships are still a great distance from
     Atlantis. Can you really sense them from so far away?

     TEYLA
     This feeling is a little different than in the past. Perhaps it is
     because it is always there now. I am getting used to it. Never
     before in my lifetime have so many Wraith been awake.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Do many of your people have this ability?

     TEYLA
     Some. Among those few, some can sense the Wraith stronger than
     others. I have always been among the first to know they are coming.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     That makes you special. How does that make you feel?

     TEYLA
     I do not know. I suppose I have not given it much thought.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Why not?

     TEYLA
     Why do some people have blue eyes and others brown?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Tell me about your nightmares.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [A Wraith walks the corridor. It enters Teyla's quarters. It has
   Teyla's face. Teyla wakes up from the nightmare, in her bed.]

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

     TEYLA
     It was me.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     You were standing over yourself?

     TEYLA
     It was me...but it was not me. I was a Wraith.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     The truth is, people waste a lot of time trying to interpret their
     dreams. They're really just another way our brain thinks when we're
     asleep. There are no hidden meanings. In fact, we tend to forget
     most everything we dream about. Our conscious mind is capable of
     deciding what's most important to us.

     TEYLA
     Well, the fact that, on some level, I see myself as a Wraith is very
     disturbing to me.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     I think this special ability you have, this talent for sensing the
     Wraith, connects you to them in your mind...maybe in a way you would
     like to deny. You said you hadn't really given it much thought in
     the past. I don't think that's true.

     TEYLA
     What am I supposed to do? I cannot change it.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Probably not. But the unknown frightens us. We all like to feel in
     control even though most of the time our power over most things is
     just an illusion. But I find, the more we know about something, the
     more we can convince ourselves we are in control of it.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Teyla visits Beckett.]

     BECKETT
     I ran every test I could on all of you from the get-go.
     Physiologically, you and your people are the same as we are. I have
     no explanation for any of your special super powers.

     TEYLA
     I only have one.

     BECKETT
     I've seen you fight, my dear.

     TEYLA
     I have previously traced this ability as something that is passed on
     through family lineage. Does that not make it biological?

     BECKETT

     It would seem so, but without genetic samples from everyone in your
     family tree, I would have little to no chance of identifying the
     specific characteristic that causes the anatomical response.
     (off her confusion)
     It'd be difficult.

     TEYLA
     Any chance you would have time to fly me over to the mainland?

     BECKETT
     If you're willing to take your life into your own hands. I'd love a
     break.

   EXT--ABOVE OCEAN SURFACE, DAY

   [The Puddle Jumper flies over the ocean.]

   EXT--MAINLAND VILLAGE, DAY

   [The village consists of many Earth-built tents in a clearing. There
   are multiple camp fires burning.]

   INT--CHARIN'S TENT

   [Charin serves soup to Teyla.]

     CHARIN
     You've changed, Teyla.

     TEYLA
     My hair is shorter.

     CHARIN
     It's more than your hair, dear. I can still see the little girl who
     used to paint me beautiful pictures while she sang the songs of the
     Ancients.

     TEYLA
     I have not been that girl in a long time, Charin.

     CHARIN
     No, but even Teyla, leader of the Athosians, always found the time
     to come and visit with poor, old Charin.

     TEYLA
     I have missed your tuttleroot soup.

     CHARIN
     But I suspect it's more than my soup that has brought you here.
     You've come to pluck me from my tent and take me to yet another
     world.

     TEYLA
     Not yet. But it seems we may have to evacuate again soon, at least
     temporarily.

     CHARIN
     Did you allow yourself to expect differently?

     TEYLA
     I still believe that we can one day be free of the Wraith.

     CHARIN
     You can save such stories for those whose bones aren't failing them.

     TEYLA
     Charin, do you know why I can sense the Wraith coming?

     CHARIN
     You were born to it. There have been a few in every generation.

     TEYLA
     I know, but has no one ever wondered how that is possible?

     CHARIN
     Some believe it was a gift from the Ancestors.

     TEYLA
     And you?

     CHARIN
     Your father asked me not to tell you.

     TEYLA
     My father is not here anymore.

     CHARIN
     No other living Athosian knows of this, for good reason.

     TEYLA
     Please. Tell me anyway.

     CHARIN
     My grandfather used to tell a story--no one has ever heard the like,
     before or since--about the few who once returned.

     TEYLA
     Returned?

     CHARIN
     There was a planet... As was expected, every so often, the Wraith
     came. Villagers were taken. But there, on this particular planet, on
     several occasions, the taken came back.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

   [Teyla recounts the story to Weir and Sheppard.]

     TEYLA
     Some believed that the ancestors had returned their loved ones to
     them that they had been blessed with a gift that made them unwanted
     by the Wraith. Others even told tales of how the taken had somehow
     vanquished the Wraith. But soon, the taken began to be feared.

     WEIR
     Why?

     TEYLA
     They spoke of hearing voices. Many began to behave strangely. Some
     became violent, even murderous.

     WEIR
     Well, it doesn't sound like the Ancients were responsible for that.

     TEYLA
     No. The villagers turned on the taken. It was a massacre. All but a
     few were killed. The rest were ostracized sent away. After that, no
     others that were taken from that village ever returned again. But
     those few who survived, they are the ones who Charin believes passed
     on the gift.

     SHEPPARD
     And one of the taken that survived was...

     TEYLA
     My lineage. I have the address to the planet where this happened.
     Charin says the village is long gone. All that is left are ruins,
     but still, I wish to go there.

     WEIR
     Now?

     TEYLA
     I believe this must be coming to light now for a reason. Maybe we
     can find evidence of what really happened.

     WEIR
     Look, Teyla, there are a lot of things that we need to get done.

     TEYLA
     Maybe there is a way to fight the Wraith that we have yet to
     discover. Perhaps my ancestors were simply not enlightened enough to
     recognize their gift for what it was.

     SHEPPARD
     Doesn't hurt to take a look around.

   EXT--PLANET OF THE TAKEN, NIGHT

   [The team explores ruins on the dark, foggy planet.]

     FORD
     Sir, there's nothing here.

     SHEPPARD
     I know.

     FORD
     Well, it's dark. Shouldn't we be getting back?

     SHEPPARD
     Just give her a minute.

   [There is thunder.]

     FORD
     Sir...

     SHEPPARD
     Ford, I need her to put this behind her, get some sleep. We all do,
     so whatever it takes.

   [McKay examines readings on his hand-held sensor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     I've got something here.

     FORD
     Really?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. I've got a little...

   [McKay starts to walk away, following the signals.]

     FORD

     (joking)
     You've got a little what? Hey, McKay, you've got a little what?
     What? Oh, it's okay when you guys make fun of me.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

   [They gather at a rock wall.]

     MCKAY
     Picking up a faint energy signal. It's getting stronger. Coming from
     here.

     FORD
     There's nothing here.

     MCKAY
     Well, the magic Ancient device hasn't lied yet.

     SHEPPARD
     It's solid.

     MCKAY
     Well, there's definitely something weird here.

     SHEPPARD
     Weird how?

   [Teyla touches the rock and falls through it, as if it is not solid.]

     FORD
     How about that?

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla! Teyla!

   [Sheppard touches the rock, but it's now solid again.]

     MCKAY
     Maybe if you got a good running start. You know, really slam into
     it.

   [Sheppard touches it gently. Suddenly the wall disappears, revealing
   Teyla standing at the entrance to a chamber.]

     SHEPPARD
     How'd you do that?

     TEYLA
     I do not know. I was just looking for a way out.

   [They all go inside.]

     FORD
     Looks like the inside of a Wraith ship.

     MCKAY
     What the hell were they doing here?

   [They hear a clanging sound in the distance.]

   INT--ATLANTIS LAB

   [McKay works at a computer. Weir enters.]

     WEIR
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Elizabeth.

     WEIR
     Sheppard said you think you found a Wraith laboratory.

     MCKAY
     Certainly looks that way. Some sort of hidden, secret facility. It's
     obviously been abandoned for a very long time. I was able to pull
     this data recorder from one of the computer consoles.

   [He holds up the unit.]

     WEIR
     You think the Wraith were experimenting on the people of that
     planet?

     MCKAY
     I have no idea. I'm hoping this thing will tell us.

     WEIR
     Why their need for secrecy? The Wraith can take people at will and
     do whatever they want with them.

   [Strange symbolic writing appears on the screen.]

     MCKAY
     Here we go. There. Now, that, uh... That means absolutely nothing to
     me. The last time I saw the contents of one of these, it showed a
     galactic positioning system for ships. It was more, um...pictures
     than symbols.

     WEIR
     I wonder...

     MCKAY
     Just so you know, you didn't actually finish that sentence out loud.

     WEIR
     Well, this is obviously a language.

     MCKAY
     Wraith language?

     WEIR
     That would make sense. I'd love to have a good look through this.

     MCKAY
     Knock yourself out. I have to get back to the control chair anyway.

   [McKay leaves.]

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Why do you think you could access the doorway when no one else
     could?

     TEYLA
     I don't know.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Is it because only a Wraith can enter a secret Wraith facility?

     TEYLA
     I'm not a Wraith.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER

     (aggressively)
     Tell me...what does it feel like to be a Wraith?

   [Teyla has the face of a Wraith.]

     TEYLA
     I feel hunger.

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla wakes up, very upset.]

   INT--CONTROL CHAIR ROOM

   [Beckett, McKay and Zelenka are there.]

     BECKETT
     Don't you remember what happened last time I sat in one of those?

     MCKAY
     There's nowhere near enough power in the thing to do anything.

     BECKETT
     Then why bother? Gentlemen, it's quite late.

     ZELENKA
     We are trying to determine exactly how much power is required to
     operate the systems that are controlled by the chair.

     MCKAY
     And in order to do that, it needs to be on.

     BECKETT
     You have the gene now.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but I can't be trying to analyze the feedback data while I'm
     concentrating on keeping the damn thing activated.

     BECKETT
     Why don't you analyze it?

     ZELENKA
     Well, I could analyze it, but Rodney doesn't think that--

   [Weir arrives.]

     WEIR
     Gentlemen, how's it coming?

     MCKAY
     Well, not good.

     WEIR
     Well, I'm sorry. This won't help. Carson, I need you.

     BECKETT
     Oh, thank God.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but we're using him.

     BECKETT
     What is it? Is someone hurt?

     WEIR
     You were right.

     BECKETT
     Lovely. About what?

     WEIR
     Your theory of the Wraith evolving after the Ancients arrived in the
     Pegasus galaxy.

     MCKAY
     You've got to be kidding me.

     ZELENKA
     Pay up.

     BECKETT
     How do you know?

     WEIR
     The Wraith language is a derivative of Ancient.

     MCKAY
     Well, that doesn't categorically mean--

     WEIR
     Rodney, please. That's not why I need to see you. I've been able to
     translate the first part of the log from the Wraith data device.

     BECKETT
     Really?

   [Weir and Beckett leave.]

     MCKAY
     All right, we'll try Dr. Kusanagi again.

     ZELENKA
     Kusanagi again.

     MCKAY
     Now.

     ZELENKA
     Okay.

     MCKAY
     Thank you.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, MORNING

   INT--ATLANTIS LAB

   [Teyla enters, finding Weir and Beckett working at a laptop.]

     TEYLA
     Good morning. You look like I feel.

     WEIR
     Well, we've been up all night.

     TEYLA
     You wanted to see me?

     BECKETT
     You'd better sit down.

     TEYLA
     What is it?

     WEIR
     Well, I translated the first part of the log you that brought back,
     and... are you sure you don't want to have a seat? The Wraith were
     conducting experiments on your ancestors. It was just one Wraith,
     actually, and he was doing it against the wishes of the other
     Wraith, which is why he was doing it in secret.

     TEYLA
     What was he doing?

     BECKETT
     I think he was trying to make their food source more compatible with
     their species.

     TEYLA
     I do not understand.

     BECKETT
     It was very easy to miss. In fact, I couldn't even make the kind of
     comparison necessary to isolate the specific strand. We needed
     Wraith cells, which we eventually got, but then we needed a full
     mapping of the genetic code contained within those cells, which
     wasn't even 50% complete--

     TEYLA
     Please. Tell me.

     BECKETT
     You have some Wraith DNA in your genetic makeup.

   [Teyla is shocked.]

   INT--BRIEFING ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     You're saying Teyla is part Wraith?

     BECKETT
     A very small part.

     WEIR
     Which makes her about as different from us as you, because of the
     Ancient gene you possess.

     MCKAY
     Well, and some other things.

     FORD
     Still, Bates is going to go nuts over this.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's just keep this one under our hat.

     WEIR
     Well, obviously, Teyla is very concerned about how everyone will
     react.

     MCKAY
     What, so you think this Wraith scientist was trying to make humans
     what, more tasty?

     WEIR
     The log seems to indicate that he was looking for a way to make the
     feeding process more efficient.

     MCKAY
     I thought you already said they had a number of genetic
     characteristics similar to humans.

     BECKETT
     They do, but they're still much closer to the bug creature that
     attacked Major Sheppard than to us.

     SHEPPARD
     Hey, I thought we weren't going to mention that anymore.

     BECKETT
     Sorry.

     WEIR
     Also interesting is the fact that the Wraith language appears to be
     a derivative of Ancient, which seems to suggest that the Wraith
     evolved after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.

     BECKETT
     My theory is that the Ancients unwittingly allowed humans to evolve
     on a planet with...insect species on it. At some point, the insects
     fed on humans and somehow incorporated our DNA into theirs. The
     Wraith are an evolution of that combination.

     FORD
     So what you're saying is the Ancients actually created the Wraith?

     BECKETT
     By accident.

     MCKAY
     Or negligence.

     WEIR
     Well, either way, it doesn't matter.

     BECKETT
     Ultimately, the more we know about Wraith physiology, the closer we
     get to a biological weapon that can attack the Wraith and leave
     humans unharmed.

     MCKAY
     Yes, but for the moment, all we know is that the Ancients might have
     accidentally created the Wraith, and why Teyla can sense them
     coming. I mean, fabulous, mystery solved, but neither of which that
     help, in any way, stop them from coming.

     WEIR
     Rodney's right. Let's get back to work.

     MCKAY
     Thank you.

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

     TEYLA
     I know that it is not my fault. There's nothing I can do about it.
     The fact is, I am really no different now than I was yesterday or
     last week.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     But you feel different.

     TEYLA
     Yes. I think the thing that I am most worried about is how people
     will perceive me. My father told people that it was a gift. I was
     special, but in a good way. I could help my people by warning them
     of the Wraith's approach. He did it to protect me, but in many ways,
     I think that it is why they first turned to me as a leader.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     As you just said, you're no different than you were yesterday.

     TEYLA
     Yes, but now they have reason to fear me.

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

     MCKAY
     All right, even with Major Sheppard in the chair, we weren't able
     to, uh...

   [Weir holds up a finger as she looks at her laptop.]

     MCKAY
     What? What is that?

     WEIR
     Something you said made me wonder...

     MCKAY
     I thought we decided there were more important things--

     WEIR
     Why did the Wraith scientist stop the experiments?

     MCKAY
     What would I have said that would make you think that?

     WEIR
     I don't remember.

     MCKAY
     Well, it's just... It's a good point. I'm just wondering what I said
     'cause... Sorry. What have you got?

     WEIR
     Well, at first I thought it was because the other Wraith caught him.

     SHEPPARD
     They didn't?

     WEIR
     No, according to this, he stopped on his own.

     MCKAY
     See, now you've got me wondering why the rest of the Wraith didn't
     want these experiments taking place in the first place.

     WEIR
     Exactly.

     MCKAY
     Especially since they were supposed to be intended to improve things
     for everyone.

     WEIR
     Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

     MCKAY
     I just said it.

     SHEPPARD
     Will you stop?

     WEIR
     Okay, here's the most interesting part. The Wraith communicate with
     each other using some sort of telepathic network.

     SHEPPARD
     I noticed that.

     WEIR
     Thankfully, they can't seem to read the minds of humans, though.

     SHEPPARD
     That's good, but what does this have to do with the Wraith stopping
     the experiments?

     WEIR
     Because, by combining even small amounts of Wraith DNA with humans,
     the scientist was giving the humans Wraith mental abilities. The
     subjects of his experiments were able to hear the Wraith
     communications.

     SHEPPARD
     In the stories that Teyla told, the voices that the people heard
     were...

     WEIR
     Were Wraith. Exactly. It must have driven them mad. The Wraith
     scientist couldn't find a way around it, so eventually he gave up.

     MCKAY
     I don't understand. I mean, why let them back into the general
     population, then?

     WEIR
     Well, it seems he thought that interbreeding with normal humans
     might dilute the effect.

     MCKAY
     Before he realized he was wrong, it was too late.

     WEIR
     When the other Wraith did find out what he had done, they wiped out
     all the people on the planet... But not before several of the test
     subjects had already been ostracized and forced to leave.

     MCKAY
     Okay, so how does this help us?

     WEIR
     Teyla may have more than just the ability to sense the Wraith
     coming.

     MCKAY
     What? You're saying you think Teyla might be able to...tap into this
     Wraith psychic network?

     SHEPPARD
     If she can, we'll be able to gather all the intel we ever needed
     about them.

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

     TEYLA
     I have never been able to hear the thoughts of the Wraith before.

     WEIR
     According to the notes all the test subjects who were given the
     Wraith DNA, they had the ability.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     It's possible it's because you've never actually tried before.

     WEIR
     You didn't know you could read Wraith minds, and quite frankly, who
     would want to? Look, Teyla, I would not even consider asking you to
     do this if I didn't think it could potentially provide us with some
     vital information.

     TEYLA
     I just do not know what to do.

     WEIR
     Well, Dr. Heightmeyer has a theory.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     I think it's possible that, over time, through several generations
     people with your ability have developed a mental barrier to the
     thought projections of the Wraith. Sort of a self-defense mechanism.
     If we can get past that...

     TEYLA
     How?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     We have a treatment process called hypnosis.

     WEIR
     Dr. Heightmeyer can lead you through it and Dr. Beckett will remain
     on hand at all times to monitor your physiology.

     TEYLA
     The Wraith are still very far away, are they not?

     WEIR
     Yes, they are, and McKay, he does have some doubts about the range
     of this telepathy.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     But as you've said, you can sense the Wraith now. If that's merely a
     bleed-through effect into your consciousness of a greater latent
     ability, then it may be worth trying to break the barrier. To be
     perfectly honest, it's not something I would ever recommend doing
     under any other circumstances.

     WEIR
     But these are far from normal circumstances that we're in, Teyla.

     TEYLA
     If I can somehow provide us with something--their strategy, a
     weakness--I see no other choice.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Teyla lies on an infirmary bed. Beckett adjusts her I.V.]

     BECKETT
     Okay, I think we're ready.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Are you? Okay, I want you to breathe...nice and deeply, and try to
     relax. Dr. Beckett's going to administer a mild sedative. Now, if
     this works, we should still be able to communicate with each other.

   [Beckett injects the sedative into the I.V. port.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Remember, we can wake you at any time, using a very low-grade
     electrical current. It won't hurt at all. Just say, "Out," and we'll
     end it. Now, focus on this light as I speak.

   [She holds up a pen light, pointed at Teyla's face.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     You told me that the feeling that you get from the Wraith is a cold,
     dark feeling deep inside you. I want you to think about that. Look
     for it in your mind. Now, close your eyes and listen to it. Don't
     resist. Go to that place where it lives. What do you hear?

     TEYLA
     Nothing.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     You told me that your father was taken by the Wraith. Do you
     remember sensing it that day?

     TEYLA
     Yes.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Think back to that feeling. Now listen. What do you hear?

     TEYLA
     Noise. Voices. So many voices whispering.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Listen closely. Listen for one.

     TEYLA
     I can see.

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Tell us what you see, Teyla.

     TEYLA
     I am on a ship. I am walking.

     SHEPPARD
     She can actually see what's happening?

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     If the Wraith can project their thoughts, then that may include what
     they're seeing.

     TEYLA
     There are other Wraith. And they do not notice me. I am in a room
     full of people being preserved so that they can be fed upon. I am
     feeding. I am killing him.

   [As she speaks, scenes of what she is seeing appear. She is feeding on
   a young man trapped in a Wraith pod.]

     WEIR
     Stop. Beckett, stop.

   [Teyla wakes up.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     It's okay. It's okay. You're here, in Atlantis.

     WEIR
     Teyla, I...I had no right to ask you to do this.

   [Weir and Sheppard leave.]

     TEYLA

     (agitated)
     Get these things off of me.

     BECKETT
     All right, settle down, Teyla. I have to take this off.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     WEIR
     I can't put her through this, John. I know it was my idea, but it's
     too much to ask.

     SHEPPARD
     You might feel differently once the hive ships show up.

     TEYLA
     Dr. Weir. Why did you make them stop?

     WEIR
     Excuse me?

     TEYLA
     I was on one of the hive ships that is headed here. I could hear
     them. I could see. It was working.

     WEIR
     You were watching them feed.

     TEYLA
     Yes. I actually felt one of them feed. But I can handle it. I can
     help us, I know it.

     WEIR
     Teyla, I never should've--

     TEYLA
     I am going to try again.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Teyla narrates what she is seeing.]

     TEYLA
     I am walking through the ship. I am in some sort of control room.

   [Teyla opens her eyes and looks around, then gives an evil grin.]

     TEYLA
     You are all so pathetic.

     SHEPPARD
     Something tells me that's not Teyla talking.

     TEYLA
     Nothing can stop us.

     WEIR
     Wake her up.

   [Beckett delivers a shock.]

     TEYLA
     You are all going to die.

     WEIR
     Now!

   [He delivers another one. Teyla arches and falls back to the bed.]

     TEYLA
     What happened?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Weir, Sheppard, and Heightmeyer walk through to Weir's office.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Dr. Beckett has her sedated, and she's resting comfortably. She
     seems fine, but I would like some time to let what she's been
     through sink in. She may still be in shock. I have no idea what the
     long-term psychological effect will be.

     SHEPPARD
     She said she could see some type of control room--maybe a map, an
     attack plan. She just needs to get a better look.

     WEIR
     John, you were there. A Wraith had control of her.

   [The 'gate alarm sounds. They rush back to the control room.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Incoming wormhole. We're getting Sergeant Bates' I.D.C. It's the
     Alpha site.

     BATES

     (over radio)
     This is Sergeant Bates. Code red. We're under attack and coming in
     hot!

     WEIR
     Lower the shield.

   [Sheppard grabs a gun from a guard and rushes down the stairs. Bates
   comes through, followed by his team. Weapons fire comes through as
   well.]

     BATES
     Move it, move it! That's it, we're clear.

     SHEPPARD
     Raise the shield!

   [The 'gate shuts down.]

     WEIR
     Is everybody okay?

     BATES
     All off-world personnel accounted for.

     SHEPPARD
     I guess that planet isn't safe anymore.

     BATES
     They showed up by ship, and dropped some sort of device by the gate
     as we were leaving.

     SHEPPARD
     I've seen it before. They're tagging the planet.

     BATES
     If we're going to evacuate Atlantis, we're going to need a new place
     to go.

     WEIR
     That planet was supposed to be uninhabited. What did the Wraith want
     with it?

     BATES
     I don't know. It's almost like they knew we were there.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Ford visits Teyla.]

     TEYLA
     I was close. I was so close. I really think if I had another
     chance...

     FORD
     Hey, you don't have to prove anything to anyone around here.

     TEYLA
     I think this could make a difference. I saw a hologram. I think it
     was a map, maybe even a battle plan.

     FORD
     We know their battle plan. They're coming to wipe us out.

     TEYLA
     I'm not so sure that is true. They want something from us.

     FORD
     Yeah. Yeah, they want to eat us.

     TEYLA
     No, something more. They are desperate.

     FORD
     Really?

     TEYLA
     Yes, it is surprising. They are confident in their dominance over
     us, but mainly because there are so many of them--too many to
     sustain for long. They have all awakened early, and there is not
     enough food to go around. It was just a feeling. The voices were so
     hard to separate.

     FORD
     You don't remember one of them speaking through you?

     TEYLA
     No, but I remember the feeling just before it happened. Next time--

     FORD
     I don't think Dr. Weir is going to let there be a next time.

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Bates is briefed by Weir and Sheppard.]

     BATES
     If what you're saying is true, then chances are it was Teyla who
     gave away the location of our Alpha site to the Wraith.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't think there was time.

     BATES
     You don't know that they didn't have a ship in the general area.

     WEIR
     Look, I admit, in retrospect asking Teyla to connect with the
     Wraith, it may have been a mistake.

     BATES
     With all due respect, I don't think there's much doubt about that.

     SHEPPARD
     Take it easy, Sergeant. It's not like she willfully gave away our
     position.

   [Ford enters.]

     FORD
     She wants to try again. Look, she says she was getting close to
     something big, something she's convinced we need to know.

     WEIR
     No. I'm sorry. The problem is, I'm not sure Teyla's thinking about
     what's best for herself.

     BATES
     Or that she could compromise us further.

     SHEPPARD
     At this point, we have more to gain from the Wraith than they do
     from us.

     FORD
     She wants to do it. Fact is, there may not be anything we can do to
     stop her from trying, so isn't it better if we're all there?

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Okay. Close your eyes and relax, and listen for the voices.

   [Teyla imagines walking through the ship. She sees a hologram and sees
   the Wraith indicate a feeding ground.]

     DR. HEIGHTMEYER
     Teyla?

     WEIR
     Break the connection.

   [Beckett hits the shock button.]

     BECKETT
     It's not working.

     TEYLA
     No!

     BECKETT
     Teyla!

   [Teyla wakes up an slugs Beckett. She grabs the I.V. pole and hits a
   computer with it, then hits Sheppard. She tosses Ford across the room.
   She approaches Weir, but falls when Bates enters and shoots her twice
   with a stunner. Everyone rushes to tend to her.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

     WEIR
     I can only hope we haven't caused her psychological damage.

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla's one of the strongest people I know. The fact that she's been
     able to hold it together until now after what she's been through in
     her life...

   [Beckett arrives, a bandage on his face.]

     BECKETT
     Oh, there you are. Major, Dr. Weir.

     WEIR
     Carson, how are you feeling?

     BECKETT
     Doozy of a headache, but I'll be fine. Teyla's awake. She wants to
     see both of you.

   [They leave.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

     BECKETT
     Teyla, are you thirsty? Can I get you some water?

     TEYLA
     No. I am so sorry. I really thought I could prevent--

     SHEPPARD
     It's all right. Everyone's fine.

     WEIR
     We are concerned that the Wraith can connect to you at will, though.

     TEYLA
     It has never happened before. No, I am sure I have to connect with
     them first. I saw their plans, the route their ships are taking to
     get here.

     WEIR
     That's good.

     TEYLA
     There's more. They do not just want Atlantis. They know about you.

     WEIR
     What do you mean?

     SHEPPARD
     Sumner. The female Wraith wasn't just feeding on him. She was
     interrogating him.

     TEYLA
     That is why they're all waking up. That is why they are coming here.
