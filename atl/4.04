   EXT--ALIEN JUNGLE, NIGHT

   [Sheppard's team hacks their way through the dense foliage.]

     RONON

     (frustrated)
     What are we doing?

     MCKAY
     Exploring the Pegasus Galaxy. It's what we do.

     RONON
     You know what I meant.

     TEYLA
     There certainly doesn't appear to be anything here that would help
     in our fight against the Wraith, or the Replicators.

     MCKAY
     Come on! You guys kill me! Planets are huge you know.

     RONON
     Yeah, and usually you're the one complaining.

   [McKay scoffs.]

     TEYLA
     This enthusiasm is most unlike you, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

     SHEPPARD
     We did a standard flyover in the jumper, scanned for life
     signs--nothing.

     MCKAY
     You can't fly around for ten minutes and decide there's nothing
     here.

     SHEPPARD
     Mmm, yes, I can.

   [McKay's scanner beeps.]

     MCKAY
     I'm getting strange energy readings.

     RONON
     Yeah? From where?

     MCKAY
     I can't pinpoint the source. The jungle's pretty thick though. It
     could be hiding just about anything.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know. It's almost as if someone in a warm, cozy room typing
     at their computer sent us here for their own amusement.

     MCKAY
     You don't really think Zelenka would do that?

     RONON

     (ominously)
     If he did, he's going to be sorry.

     MCKAY
     Do you have any idea how many gate addresses there are in the
     Ancient database that have no accompanying description?

     SHEPPARD
     Forty-two.

     MCKAY
     No. I-I think it's a little bit more than that. Look, I don't really
     remember. That's not the point. Nothing. No information at all. I
     say, that has to mean something.

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe that means there was nothing worth writing about on those
     planets.

     MCKAY
     Or there is, but the Ancients are trying to hide it.

     SHEPPARD

     (dryly)
     From themselves.

     MCKAY
     A lot of time has passed since the Ancients were around. You know,
     things change. Maybe there's something here they didn't know about.

     TEYLA
     You have a bet riding on this, don't you?

     MCKAY

     (innocently)
     What makes you say that?

   [Sheppard steps into a swampy hole. He grits his teeth.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. That's it.

   [He pulls his foot out of the muck.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm calling this one. Everyone back to the jumper.

     MCKAY
     Aw, come on!

     RONON
     Face it, McKay. You lost this one.

   [They all turn back. As McKay turns he notices something on a tree
   trunk light up.]

     MCKAY

     (excited)
     Oh? Oh! Hello, what's that, then?

   [They all turn around. Sheppard joins McKay, who is studying the object
   with his scanner. It is a group of crystals nestled on the trunk.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, it looks like...some kind of, uh, natural crystalline growth.
     I think this might be what's causing the energy readings.

     TEYLA

     (intrigued)
     Pretty.

     SHEPPARD
     Looks like one of those toys you play with when you're a kid.

     MCKAY
     What, a Commodore 64?

     RONON
     Triple barrel shotgun?

     SHEPPARD

     (rolling his eyes)
     A kaleidoscope.

     MCKAY
     You realize what this means?

     SHEPPARD
     We discovered an alien fungus that glows.

   [Sheppard becomes fascinated with the device, his face reflected in its
   many facets.]

     MCKAY
     How 'bout a power source that literally grows on trees. Look,
     admittedly, these energy readings are pretty low level, but uh, if
     these crystals could be cultivated? Then...whoa-whoa, wait. What are
     you doing?

   [Sheppard reaches forward and touches the device. The instant he
   touches the object, a spark happens, and he's thrown several feet
   through the air. He lands on his back with a groan. The crystals
   darken. Teyla is the first to reach him.]

     TEYLA
     Are you all right?

     SHEPPARD
     Uh, yeah. I'm fine. Just a little shock.

     MCKAY
     That could've been dangerous! I told you it was giving off energy!

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, honestly, I...I don't know why I did that.

   [McKay checks his scanner.]

     MCKAY

     (annoyed)
     Well, you killed it!

     SHEPPARD

     (unsympathetic)
     Oh, really?

     MCKAY
     Well, it's not giving off energy anymore.

     RONON
     Well, maybe you just scared it?

     SHEPPARD
     You don't even know if it was alive!

     MCKAY
     Seriously, why would you touch it?!

   [Ronon and Teyla help Sheppard to his feet.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know! I said that, okay? I just did! Now, will you leave it
     at that?

   [McKay starts fooling with scanner.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, well there's got to be more of them around here.

     SHEPPARD

     (impatiently)
     I'm going to recommend sending a science team back here to check it
     out.

     MCKAY
     I am a science team!

   [Sheppard nods to Ronon, and Sheppard and Teyla start heading back.
   Ronon grabs McKay by the back of his tactical vest and herds him back.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, fine. Let's desert a potentially significant discovery just
     because you guys don't want me to win a bet with Zelenka?!

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Sheppard sits waiting on an exam bed. Teyla stands next to him. Keller
   approaches.]

     KELLER
     Well your scans are clear. Blood tests are normal. As far as I can
     tell, you're in perfect health.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Teyla)
     See, I told you.
     (to Keller)
     Thanks, Doc.

     KELLER
     No more touching strange things.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's good advice.

   [Keller heads back to her duties. Sheppard gets up and he and Teyla
   leave the infirmary.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.

     TEYLA
     It's been a long day.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, thanks for hanging out.

     TEYLA
     Just wanted to be sure.

   [Sheppard pats her on the back reassuringly. A strange glow appears and
   disappears where his hand touched her.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm fine. Get some sleep.

   [He parts ways with her.]

     TEYLA

     (calling after him)
     Good night, John.

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla sleeps restlessly.]

   INT--ATHOSIAN HUT

   [Teyla looks around the setting. She is dressed in formal Athosian
   gear, her hair like it was before she met the Atlantis team. She turns
   around to find Sheppard sitting at a table, eating from bowls of fruit
   and other foods.]

     SHEPPARD
     This is pretty good. What is it?

   [Ronon appears next to her.]

     RONON

     (smugly)
     I knew you two were going to eventually hook up.

     TEYLA
     We are not hooking up! It's just dinner!

   [McKay wanders by with his scanner.]

     MCKAY
     I'm telling you, there's something in here giving off a strange
     energy reading.

   [Ronon has been replaced by Sheppard. His casual manner is gone. His
   posture is threatening as he stands in front of her.]

     TEYLA

     (warily)
     John...? What are you doing?

     SHEPPARD
     Colonel Carter doesn't trust you. No one does but me.

     TEYLA
     What are you talking about?

     SHEPPARD
     What's wrong with you?

   [He starts circling her.]

     TEYLA
     What do you mean? Nothing.

     SHEPPARD
     You've never been the same since you got in the mind of that Wraith
     queen.

     TEYLA

     (unnerved)
     What?

   [Screams and Wraith darts as from a culling are heard outside the
   tent.]

     TEYLA'S FATHER

     (calling from outside)
     Teyla!

     TEYLA
     Father!

   [She goes to the door. As she reaches for the tent flap, it's shoved
   aside. Sheppard is there, partially transformed by the Iratus bug. He
   reaches out and grabs her by the throat, pushing her back onto the
   table. Pinned, she watches as he reaches forward with a "feeding hand"
   and grabs her brutally.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla awakens from her dream by sitting straight up, gasping and
   clawing at her chest to push the non-existent hand away. She gasps and
   cries in relief.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Teyla, McKay, and Ronon sit at a table eating breakfast.]

     TEYLA
     I cannot even begin to tell you how bizarre it was.

     MCKAY
     Please, you want bizarre? Let me tell you.

     RONON
     You know what? Don't.

   [Sheppard joins them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Morning.

   [He sits down with his tray. Teyla stiffens and shifts slightly away
   from him. Ronon and McKay say nothing, but just look at Teyla.]

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     MCKAY
     Teyla had a dream about you last night.

     TEYLA

     (admonishing)
     Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD

     (intrigued)
     Really? What was it about?

     TEYLA
     Actually, it was more of a nightmare, and I'd rather not talk about
     it.

     SHEPPARD

     (teasing)
     Was I the dashing hero saving you from a big bad monster?

     RONON
     Actually, you were the big, bad monster.

     SHEPPARD
     Really?

     TEYLA
     Like I said, I'd rather not talk about it.

   [She stands.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where are you going?

     TEYLA
     I'm sorry. I have a headache. I did not sleep well last night.

   [She glares at McKay and Ronon and leaves. Sheppard watches her go,
   concerned. He turns back to Ronon and McKay.]

     SHEPPARD
     Is she really mad at me? I can't control what's in her dreams!

     MCKAY

     (scoffing)
     Really? You think you can't control a person's dreams? My father
     read me Moby Dick when I was seven years old. I mean, seriously,
     what was the man thinking? Do you have any idea how long I had
     nightmares about-about being eaten by a whale?

     RONON
     They haven't stopped, have they?

     MCKAY
     No.

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

   [Teyla meets with Heightmeyer.]

     TEYLA
     It's coming from outside. I go to the opening. I hear darts. I pull
     open the tent, and...he comes inside. I know it's not really Colonel
     Sheppard, but I can't help but feel different towards him. Do you
     think it's my...subconscious trying to tell me something?

     HEIGHTMEYER
     If there is something real going on between you and Colonel Sheppard
     that you feel you need to address, you definitely should. Otherwise,
     don't let it bother you.

     TEYLA
     I've had horrible nightmares before. Of my father being taken when I
     was a little girl. The cullings since. But none of them have felt
     like this. When I woke up, I could barely catch my breath. I know it
     sounds silly, but...I think I'm actually afraid of falling asleep.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Teyla sits on a bed. Keller takes off a blood pressure cuff.]

     KELLER
     Well...physically, there's nothing wrong with you. Other than the
     symptoms you've described, which can all be attributed to lack of
     sleep. These should help for the short term. But...if the problem
     persist, you definitely need to come back.

   [She unlocks the medicine cabinet and takes out some pills.]

     TEYLA
     You have no idea how good the thought of a solid night's sleep makes
     me feel at this point.

   [Keller hands her the pills.]

     KELLER
     Oh, I think I do. I'm not sure I've had one since I got here.

     TEYLA
     Thank you.

   [She waves the pill bottle, then claps Keller gratefully on the arm as
   she leaves.]

     KELLER
     Don't mention it. Have a good night.

   [She watches Teyla leave.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--KELLER'S QUARTERS

   [The radio beside Keller's bed squawks to life. She opens her eyes.]

     MEDIC

     (over radio)
     Doctor Keller, we have a medical emergency. Doctor Keller, please
     report immediately to the infirmary.

   [She turns on her bedside lamp and looks at her watch. She gets out of
   bed.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Keller rushes in. She is still in her nightclothes. Teyla lies on a
   bed, groaning in agony. Marie and Sheppard are on either side of her.]

     KELLER
     What's wrong?

     MARIE
     It's Teyla. She's in severe abdominal distress. Said you gave her
     some medication?

     KELLER
     I prescribed some Ambien to help her sleep. Teyla?

   [Teyla cries out in distress.]

     SHEPPARD
     Went to the mess for a late night snack. She started complaining
     about her stomach, and then she just doubled over.

     KELLER
     I thought you were going to bed. Did you take one of those pills I
     gave you?

   [Teyla rolls her eyes and writhes.]

     TEYLA
     No.

     KELLER

     (soothingly)
     Okay, just try to relax. Here, let me have a look.

   [Teyla turns onto her back, screaming in pain.]

     KELLER
     Hold her for me.

   [Sheppard, Marie, and a medic hold Teyla down. Keller starts feeling
   around her stomach. Something moves under Teyla's skin. Keller jumps
   back in shock.]

     KELLER
     Oh my God!

   [Keller backs away. The thing stretches Teyla's skin further. Teyla
   screams. Keller meets Sheppard's eyes, he appears to find this all
   entertaining.]

     MARIE
     Doctor, do something!

     KELLER
     Uh...okay, uh, we need to...sedate her. And uh...

   [Teyla screams again. The thing breaks through her stomach, spraying
   blood everywhere, even on Keller, who is several feet away by this
   point.]

     KELLER

     (horrified)
     Oh God!

   [A giant spider-like insect climbs out of Teyla's corpse. Sheppard
   looks delighted.]

     SHEPPARD
     Can you believe this?

   [Keller stares in shock.]

   INT--KELLER'S QUARTERS

   [Keller bolts upright in bed, breathing heavily.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [The room is empty. Keller enters and heads directly for the medicine
   cabinet and unlocks it. She grabs some Ambien, sighing heavily. She
   turns around to find Ronon and Sheppard directly behind her. Ronon has
   a cut on his forehead. She jumps back in alarm.]

     RONON
     Sorry, Doc. Didn't mean to scare you.

     SHEPPARD
     We were sparring. I got in a lucky shot.

     KELLER
     It's the middle of the night!

     RONON
     Maybe for you.

     KELLER
     Sit down, let me have a look.

   [Ronon complies. Keller looks at the wound.]

     KELLER

     (admonishing)
     You're going to need stitches.

   [She looks over at Sheppard, who is trying not to look amused. Ronon
   seems to be equally unfazed.]

     RONON
     Guess I taught him too much, huh?

     KELLER
     Yeah, I guess so.

     RONON

     (to Sheppard)
     You know, you don't need to stick around. I'm fine.

     SHEPPARD
     You sure?

     RONON
     Yeah. I want a rematch tomorrow, though.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Good night.

   [He hurries out. Keller has been watching the exchange, especially
   Sheppard, very warily. Ronon turns back and sees she's distracted.]

     RONON
     Something wrong?

     KELLER

     (snapping out of her reverie)
     Hmm? No. Nothing.

   [She goes back to studying the wound. Sitting on the bed, Ronon is
   still much taller than she.]

     RONON
     I don't think he's seeing anyone, you know?

     KELLER
     Oh! Oh no. That's quite all right...you know, this would be easier
     if you lay [sic] down.

     RONON
     Okay.

   [He does so, and Keller prepares to start stitching the wound.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Ronon walks down the corridor, a flesh-colored bandage on his
   forehead. He notices no one is around. He enters the Gate Room.]

     RONON
     Hello?

   [He wanders through the Control Room, which is also empty.]

     RONON

     (yelling)
     Is anyone here?

   [Panicked, he starts running. He leaps down the stairs and starts
   running through more corridors.]

     RONON
     Anyone?!

   [He gets to a door and waves it to open. The door opens, revealing a
   forest. The atmosphere is cold and foggy. Ronon looks around, then goes
   into the forest.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [The forest surrounds him, with no way back to Atlantis. Laser blasts
   start to cut through the trees at him. Ronon dodges and runs to avoid
   the blasts, which come from everywhere. A stick appears out of nowhere,
   knocking him in the chest. Ronon falls to the ground, his breath
   knocked out of him. Sheppard appears from behind the tree, one hand
   behind his back.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey, buddy. What are you running from?

     RONON
     I don't know.

     SHEPPARD
     C'mon.

   [He puts out his hand to help Ronon up, then hits him in the head with
   a large stick. Ronon blacks out.]

   [Ronon regains consciousness to find himself bound and gagged and lying
   in an open grave. Sheppard stands above him shoveling dirt inside.
   Ronon tries to cry for help and struggles to throw the dirt off of
   himself, but Sheppard keeps shoveling it into the grave.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Ronon awakens with a start, grabbing Keller's wrist from where she
   works on his forehead.]

     KELLER
     I'm really sorry. Did I-did I hurt you?

   [He looks around to find himself lying on the infirmary bed.]

     RONON
     Uh, no. No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

     KELLER
     You fell asleep.

     RONON
     I was having the strangest dream.

     KELLER
     You sure you're okay?

     RONON
     Yeah. Go ahead.

     KELLER
     I'm almost done.

   [Keller gets back to work.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Keller sits at a table with Teyla, McKay, and Ronon.]

     KELLER
     It was terrifying. There you were with this disgusting alien bug
     crawling out of your stomach, and Colonel Sheppard was acting like
     it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen.

     RONON
     That sounds like that movie.

     KELLER
     Yeah, Alien. Have you seen it?

     TEYLA
     Colonel Sheppard speaks of it often.

     MCKAY
     I still remember the first time I saw it. I certainly did not think
     it was cool.

     KELLER
     One time in med school, I made the mistake of confiding to my
     partner in biology class that it had caused my all time worst
     nightmares. He actually planted a live snake inside a cadaver I was
     working on.

     MCKAY
     Hmm. Well I never saw it as a kid. I knew from the poster it was
     gonna be too scary. No, I was sixteen when a uh, neighborhood
     theater, had a, uh, horror revival festival. I thought, you know,
     great, date movie. So, Jocelyn Rutger, third period science, uh, bit
     of a geek, but uh, she had a great...

   [He starts to gesture, then realizes his mixed company.]

     MCKAY
     Anyway. You know how girls get all...scared, curl up on your
     shoulder?

     TEYLA
     Your planet has some truly strange rituals.

     MCKAY
     Anyway. I eat when I get nervous.

     RONON

     (dryly)
     Really? I hadn't noticed.

     MCKAY
     Mmm. So...very tense. Working like a charm. Jocelyn's all freaked
     out beside me. I'm packin' away the Goobers and the popcorn. And
     then, the alien bursts out of John Hurt.

     TEYLA
     You didn't.

     MCKAY
     Mmm. Puked all over her.

     RONON

     (grinning)
     I have got to see this movie!

     KELLER
     Don't you think it's strange that each of us has had incredibly
     vivid nightmares with Colonel Sheppard being somehow an integral
     part?

     TEYLA
     Acting most unlike Colonel Sheppard.

     MCKAY
     Not me!

     KELLER
     Have you had any nightmares recently?

     MCKAY

     (pleased)
     Not a night goes by. Last night, I dreamt that um, Colonel Carter
     invited me to her quarters for dinner.

     TEYLA
     Maybe you shouldn't be telling us this, Rodney.

     KELLER

     (smirking)
     Yeah, I said nightmare. Not delusional male fantasy.

     MCKAY

     (irked)
     Wait! And listen! Turns out she was serving lemon chicken. I mean,
     lemon! And the only reason she invited me to dinner was to tell me
     that she was promoting Zelenka over me.

     RONON
     That's it?

     MCKAY

     (squirming)
     Then I was eaten by a whale. Don't ask how that happened.

     KELLER
     Okay, do you guys really think I'm crazy? I realize they're-they're
     just dreams. But...first it was Teyla. And then right after you came
     to see me, I had one.

     TEYLA
     And that's when mine stopped. Those pills you gave me knocked me out
     cold.

     KELLER
     And then Ronon had one while I was working on him.

     RONON
     What's the big deal? It's like you said, it's just a few bad dreams,
     right?

   [Ronon and McKay leave. Keller and Teyla stay and exchange concerned
   looks.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM AND CONTROL ROOM

   [Keller walks with Carter up the staircase and along the balcony to
   Carter's office.]

     KELLER
     I probably shouldn't have bothered you with this. I know I don't
     really have any hard evidence.

     CARTER
     Believe me, I've seen a good hunch go a long way in some pretty
     crazy circumstances. I'd always rather you were on your toes,
     especially with anything that seems suspicious.

     KELLER
     I know a few bad dreams isn't that significant. It's only natural
     given what we face on a daily basis. But, this was different. It
     really rattled me. Coupled with a sequential pattern. First Teyla,
     then me, then Ronon, all with Colonel Sheppard being a significant
     negative presence in our dreams.

     CARTER
     Do you have any idea what's behind it?

     KELLER
     No, I don't know. Thing is, it started right after Colonel Sheppard
     touched that crystal on M3X-387.

     CARTER
     I thought you cleared him medically.

     KELLER
     I-I did.

   [A technician approaches Carter.]

     TECHNICIAN
     Excuse me, there's an emergency situation at crew quarters' atrium.
     Security was called for and has been dispatched.

     CARTER

     Thank you.
     (to Keller)
     Excuse me.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR CREW QUARTERS ATRIUM

   [Lorne stands in his bare feet, blinking. He holds a Beretta, aimed at
   Sheppard. Sheppard stands with his hand raised. Other personnel stand
   frozen, including Teyla and Heightmeyer. A few security forces have
   guns aimed at Lorne.]

     SHEPPARD
     Put down the gun, Major. Let's talk this out.

     LORNE
     Someone get an ARG, now! Shoot him with it!

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Major, talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

     LORNE
     Just do it! Okay? Wh-wh-what's the harm? I mean, if-if he's human,
     it won't hurt him, right?

     TEYLA
     John, what is he talking about?

     LORNE
     Don't talk to him. Colonel Sheppard is a Replicator.

   [They all look at Sheppard, who stands nervously there.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, Lorne, I don't know what's gotten into you.--

   [Carter arrives.]

     LORNE
     Me?! No-no-no-no-no-no-no. It's not me!

     CARTER
     Major, how 'bout you lower your weapon.

     LORNE
     He's a Replicator! What, you don't believe me? Okay, I'll shoot him.
     You'll see.

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa! That won't be necessary. I've got my hands up in a very
     non-threatening way.

     CARTER
     I've called for an ARG.

     SHEPPARD

     (shocked)
     What, you believe him?

     CARTER

     (sotto voce)
     Of course not, but it won't hurt you, and it might help him to lower
     his gun.

   [Lorne points his gun at Carter.]

     LORNE
     You're one of them, too. Well, don't just stand there. Shoot them!
     Shoot both of them!

   [Ronon shoots Lorne from the balcony above, with his stunner. Lorne
   drops to the floor with a pained cry, dropping his gun. Sheppard holds
   his arms out still, in shock. The ARG has finally arrived. Teyla takes
   it.]

     TEYLA
     I take it I don't have to shoot either of you with this?

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Lorne sits alone at a table looking up at the observation room
   window.]

     LORNE

     (contrite)
     I'm so glad no one was hurt.

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Heightmeyer, Carter, Keller, and Sheppard are all there.]

     HEIGHTMEYER
     And you don't remember anything?

     LORNE

     (over comm)
     No. Honestly. I haven't had a sleepwalking incident since I was like
     ten.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     It's quite common for someone suffering from somnambulism to perform
     complex activities in their sleep, and remember nothing upon waking.

     SHEPPARD
     So, you think this has something to do with the crystal I touched.

     KELLER
     That's when it seemed to start. Major Lorne's not the only one. In
     each case, the person being effected reports you being a significant
     negative presence in the nightmare.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I can't control that!

     CARTER
     No, but maybe something is.

     SHEPPARD

     (skeptical)
     What. You think someone's impersonating me in their dreams?

     CARTER
     Look, I've seen more than my share of alien entities that are
     capable of this. Colonel O'Neill was once knocked unconscious by an
     energy being that lived in crystal form. It took on his appearance
     for a while.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     I read at one point, you were taken over by an alien entity.

     CARTER

     (uncomfortable)
     Yeah. Not a personal highlight.

     SHEPPARD
     The question is, what's the point?

     KELLER
     Maybe it's feeding on our fear.

   [Everyone looks at Keller.]

     KELLER

     (embarrassed)
     I'll shut up.

     CARTER
     No, no. It's not that big a leap. It's just...we don't have any
     proof.

     KELLER
     First it was Teyla. I was next. And then, Ronon, after I treated
     him.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I'm the one who touched the crystal, and I've never had a bad
     dream.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Maybe that's why you're appearing in everyone's dreams. Whatever's
     doing this imprinted your image onto itself.

     KELLER
     Now that I think about it, it's possible whatever this is, its
     spread may be limited by touch.

     CARTER
     Okay. Anyone who's had contact with Major Lorne since the incident
     needs to be isolated. If this is some sort of alien influence, we
     have to find a way to detect it.

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Sheppard's team, Heightmeyer, and Keller all sit in the briefing room
   except for McKay, who's standing by the entrance, not getting close to
   anyone.]

     SHEPPARD
     Sit down, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     I'm good right here, thank you.

   [Carter arrives and sits.]

     CARTER
     All offworld teams have been contacted and instructed not to return
     for the time being. Gate travel will be restricted to an as-needed
     basis. And until further notice, all non-essential expedition
     members will be restricted to quarters.

     RONON
     Come on. Is this really necessary? It's just a few bad dreams,
     right?

     CARTER
     The fact is, we don't really know what we're dealing with. We may
     have an alien entity on our hands capable of moving from person to
     person at will.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     And so far, the only behavior we have to evaluate suggests a certain
     malice. Now based on what's been described to me, the
     personification of Colonel Sheppard in everyone's dreams is behaving
     much like a sociopath.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Teyla)
     Did I have a goatee?

   [Teyla shakes her head.]

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Right now, all it's doing is causing some nightmares. But, we don't
     know if that's the limit of its capability.

     TEYLA
     You're saying this is only the beginning.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     I've never profiled anything like this before. It will likely
     progress: try to drive up the stakes, seek bigger thrills. Even if
     it's limited to manipulating the host's subconscious, it may be able
     to put someone in serious jeopardy.

     SHEPPARD
     So what are we talking, Freddy Krueger here?

     MCKAY
     Oh come on! We don't have a single shred of hard evidence here! I
     mean, until we do, this thing is just the bogeyman.

     CARTER
     Exactly why you're going back to the planet where Colonel Sheppard
     touched the crystal.

     MCKAY
     What? Why would we do that?

     CARTER
     Well, just as you said. To gather some hard evidence. See if there
     are any more of these things. We need to find out exactly what they
     are and how they work, and if possible, how to detect if there
     really is something inside Lorne right now. Thank you.

   [She stands, dismissing them. McKay approaches her.]

     MCKAY
     But, uh, you said, no more 'gate travel. I-I thought that was a wise
     decision.

     CARTER
     I said on an as-needed basis, McKay. I think this qualifies.

     MCKAY
     I mean, don't you think a science team would be better suited...

   [Carter looks surprised.]

     RONON
     You are a science team, remember?

   [He slaps McKay on the shoulder as he leaves. Carter follows Ronon
   out.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, fine. But it's a big planet, you know? We could really use
     some more manpower!

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET JUNGLE, NIGHT

   [Sheppard's team and Zelenka trudge through the jungle. This time they
   all wear full haz-mat gear.]

     ZELENKA
     I still can't believe you're making me do this.

     MCKAY
     Ah, you lost the bet. There's definitely something on this planet.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but I distinctly said "of value." I hardly call this particular
     discovery valuable.

     SHEPPARD
     Over here.

   [He leads them to the tree with the darkened crystal. McKay slaps
   Zelenka on the shoulder.]

     MCKAY
     Ha ha! There you go. Better get started.

     ZELENKA

     (mutters in Czech)
     "Better get started." Yeah, sure.

   [Teyla notices a lit crystal on a nearby tree.]

     TEYLA
     Rodney!

     MCKAY
     Hmm?

   [He turns and spots the active crystal.]

     MCKAY
     Don't look at it. And whatever you do, don't touch it.

     TEYLA
     I wasn't even thinking about it.

   [McKay approaches and runs his scanner over the entity.]

     MCKAY

     (to Zelenka)
     Radek, we've got a live one here!

     ZELENKA
     Uh, it could be useful to compare the two.

     MCKAY
     That's just what I was thinking.

     ZELENKA
     But be careful. It could be dangerous to try to harvest one with an
     active entity in it.

     MCKAY
     Mmm. Once again, you've read my mind. However, when you're finished
     there, I say you give it a shot.

   [Zelenka turns back to the first entity with a nervous grimace.
   Sheppard shrugs sympathetically.]

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, give it a shot.

   [Zelenka prepares to go at it with a pick and hammer.]

   INT--ATLANTIS SCIENCE LAB

   [Keller looks at the active crystal. It is in a sealed glass case with
   electrodes running from it to monitoring screens. The inactive crystal
   is similarly set up in a separate case. McKay and Zelenka work nearby.]

     KELLER
     You really think it was safe to bring a live one back?

     ZELENKA
     Ah, those containment tanks are non-conductive. We believe it needs
     conductive material in order to, uh, travel.

     MCKAY
     And having an active, uh, crystal allows us to, uh, calibrate these
     hand-held sensors to, uh, detect the energy signatures associated
     with it.

     ZELENKA
     Hopefully, we'll be able to determine if someone is actually
     carrying one of these creatures around inside of them.

     MCKAY
     As long as it doesn't know what we're up to. Otherwise, you'd think
     it would just, uh, transfer out of somebody before we could scan
     them.

     ZELENKA
     You're assuming, of course, they're not only capable, but are
     conscious and aware at all times.

   [Keller becomes drawn to the active crystal. She begins to lean
   closer.]

     MCKAY
     It's demonstrated some, uh, pretty sophisticated intelligence so
     far. It could have basic avoidance skills.

   [Keller's face appears in the multiple facets of the crystal as she
   continues to lean closer.]

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, well, we're gonna have to modify our scanners to operate on a
     range large enough to...wait a minute, we-we could calibrate the
     city-wide life signs detector to--

   [Keller starts to reach her hand forward to touch the tank.]

     MCKAY

     (sarcastic, interrupting)
     Oh, yes, Mr. Wizard! We're just gonna snap our fingers and...

   [Zelenka grabs Keller's hand and pulls it away from the tank.]

     ZELENKA

     (concerned)
     What are you doing?

   [McKay also looks over, suddenly alert. Keller seems to snap out of her
   fugue.]

     KELLER
     I don't know... It's mesmerizing. You said it was safe!

     ZELENKA
     We-we said "we think". Still...

     KELLER
     I don't know what I was doing! I can't believe it. I was suddenly
     overcome by the compulsion to want to touch it.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, we think that's how it...um...ropes in its victims.

   [McKay walks away. Zelenka grimaces and goes back to work, leaving a
   shocked Keller to stare at the crystal from a further distance.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Zelenka scans Lorne from a safe distance, then looks up at the
   observation window and shakes his head.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [McKay and Carter are watching.]

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     It's not in him.

     CARTER
     You said the entity needed conductive material to travel, right?

     MCKAY

     Well, based on the, uh...
     (suddenly realizing)
     It's the power conduits! They run pretty much through the entire
     city!

     CARTER
     It could be in anyone!

   [They both hurriedly exit.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

   [Teyla steps onto the balcony to find a panicked Heightmeyer balancing
   on the edge of the balustrade.]

     TEYLA
     Kate? What are you doing?

     HEIGHTMEYER
     I don't want to die!

     TEYLA

     (soothing)
     Good. Come down from there.

   [Heightmeyer tries to move but is petrified. The city is spread out
   many floors below her.]

     HEIGHTMEYER
     I can't.

     TEYLA
     Why not?

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Help me, please!

   [Teyla steps forward, but suddenly Sheppard is there, blocking her
   path. He holds Teyla back.]

     TEYLA
     John, stop it! Stop it! I have to help her!

   [Sheppard holds her in place, smiling evilly.]

     TEYLA
     What are you doing? John, get out of the way!

     HEIGHTMEYER

     (terrified)
     Teyla! Teyla!

     TEYLA
     Kate!

   [Heightmeyer screams as she falls backward off the tower balcony,
   falling many stories toward a pier below.]

   FADE OUT

   INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S QUARTERS

   [Keller enters the room to find Teyla standing over Heightmeyer's bed.
   Heightmeyer is in her negligé lying on the bed, eyes closed.]

     TEYLA

     (upset)
     She did not report for duty, and I can't wake her up.

   [Keller approaches with her scanner. Her eyes widen as she reads the
   findings.]

     KELLER
     She's dead.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter stands in the center of the room, bracing herself. She nods to
   the technician, who keys the intercom.]

     CARTER

     (over intercom)
     This is Colonel Carter. If I could have your attention, please. I'm
     very sorry to have to tell you that we have a lost a valuable member
     of the expedition today. Doctor Kate Heightmeyer meant a great deal
     to all of us. Her death is nothing short of tragic. I'm also sorry
     to have to report that the threat we face is still in our midst, and
     until further notice, the full lock-down protocol will remain in
     effect. Try to remain calm. We are doing everything we can to ensure
     everyone's safety and to resolve this situation quickly. Thank you.

   [While she speaks, others, such as Teyla and Sheppard, have been
   listening in their respective quarters. Sheppard looks particularly
   disturbed. Carter nods for the technician to shut down the intercom.
   Keller has been leaning on a nearby wall, listening.]

     KELLER

     (to Carter)
     That was good. I mean, horrible, obviously. Terrifying and horrible,
     but I just...meant you sounded strong. I'm sure they were at least a
     little reassured hearing your voice.

     CARTER

     (nods and lowers her head)
     Hmm.

     KELLER
     But you don't need me to tell you that.

     CARTER

     (with a rueful small laugh)
     A day like this, it doesn't hurt. Thanks.

   [Carter continues to her office.]

   INT--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS

   [Sheppard lies on his bed restlessly. He gets up and heads to his door.
   As he opens it, he finds Teyla on the other side, about to ring.]

     SHEPPARD
     I was just about to come see you, but I wasn't sure if you wanted to
     see me.

   [Teyla embraces Sheppard and silently weeps. He hesitantly returns the
   hug.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Zelenka heads over to Carter's office where she's working and calls to
   her.]

     ZELENKA
     Uh, Colonel Carter? Excuse me? I-I think I've managed to calibrate
     the city-wide sensors.

   [Carter gets up and joins him in the control room.]

     ZELENKA

     (nervously)
     I mean, heh, if it is working properly, you know. We-we had some
     trouble with the um...well...we have a positive reading.

   [He calls up a display that shows a red dot in one part of the city.]

     CARTER
     Do you know who that is?

   [They zoom in on the display.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [McKay enters and immediately notices the room has been lined with
   rubber mats. Zelenka waits for him there.]

     MCKAY
     What did you need me for? What's with the rubber walls?

     ZELENKA
     I'm sorry, Rodney. I have to go.

   [Zelenka hurries out, avoiding McKay's eyes. McKay watches him leave
   and an armed guard outside closing the door.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, you've got to be kidding.

   [He looks up to see Carter and Keller looking down on him from the
   observation window.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Carter waves at McKay. Sheppard arrives. He looks down into the
   chamber in surprise.]

     SHEPPARD
     It's in Rodney?

     CARTER
     The isolation room has been lined with insulating material to
     prevent the entity from transferring out of him and into someone
     else.

     KELLER
     If we're right, we've got it trapped.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, that doesn't help McKay much, does it? If this thing
     kills people in their sleep...

     CARTER
     No. We've got to find a way to get it out of him.

     MCKAY

     (over comm)
     Does someone want to get me some coffee? I'm already feeling a
     little tired here.

     KELLER
     I can give him something to keep him awake for a while, but it'll
     only work for so long before we start putting him at risk for
     pulmonary failure.

     CARTER

     Yep. Believe it or not, I've been there before, too. Do what you
     can. We'll try to come up with something.
     (over comm)
     Hang in there, McKay!

     MCKAY

     (petulant)
     Oh, thanks. Like I have much choice.

   [Carter exchanges looks with Sheppard, and they leave. Keller looks
   back down at McKay, who paces nervously.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Carter and Sheppard enter.]

     SHEPPARD
     Do you think it knows it's trapped?

     CARTER
     I don't know. Why?

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe there's a way to...I don't know, reason with it.

     CARTER
     Being in Doctor Weir's old office made you think of that, didn't it?

     SHEPPARD
     Normally, I just shoot the bad guys.

   [Ronon and Teyla arrive.]

     RONON
     We just heard.

     TEYLA
     There must be something we can do.

     CARTER
     That's what we're just talking about. Okay, let's say for a second
     that you could somehow communicate with it. What were you planning
     on saying?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know. I hadn't gotten that far.

     CARTER
     It-it strikes me that if it feeds on fear, or worse, likes the
     thrill of killing its host, then...well, it would take the last
     chance it had.

     SHEPPARD
     To kill McKay.

   [Carter sighs and nods.]

     SHEPPARD
     What about survival? It's trapped. Will it die without a living host
     to transfer to?

     CARTER
     I was hoping not to find out.

     TEYLA
     We could give it a chance to leave. Go home.

     CARTER
     Back into the crystal.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, sure, why not? Send it through the 'gate back to its planet.

     CARTER
     I've heard of people being talked through waking dreams before.
     Maybe...maybe McKay can be hypnotized into...a state where he could
     somehow communicate with it.

     TEYLA
     He has successfully meditated into an altered state before.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, that was after he'd been genetically altered.

     RONON
     I'm sorry, what? You want McKay to ask this thing to leave?

     SHEPPARD
     We are talking about McKay. Scary things are not exactly his
     strength.

     CARTER
     And he is up against a creature apparently capable of manipulating
     his subconscious.

     SHEPPARD
     I wish there was a way for one of us to get in there.

     CARTER

     (intrigued)
     Into McKay's dreams?

   [She appears to have an idea taking shape while Sheppard talks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, you know, help him out, give him a little moral support. Come
     on, all the things you've seen, you've never come across a way for
     one person to get into another person's dreams.

   [Carter rushes out to the control room.]

     RONON
     Where's she going? What's going on?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know, but I think I'm about to see a side of McKay I never
     wanted to see.

     TEYLA
     It does not have to be you.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well it's my bad idea.

   [He follows Carter out.]

     RONON
     What was?

   [Teyla follows Sheppard.]

     RONON
     What?

   [A frustrated Ronon follows the others.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Carter, Ronon and Teyla watch as personnel in haz-mat gear, including
   Keller and Zelenka, set up monitors and equipment in the isolation room
   below. McKay and Sheppard each lie on gurneys.]

     CARTER
     We first encountered the technology ten years ago on a planet where
     the survivors of a holocaust were living entirely in a virtual world
     created in their minds. Since then, we've managed to modify it for
     use in the VR training of SG team members. It only took some minor
     calibrations to tune it into subconscious activity.

     RONON
     So Sheppard is actually going to see McKay's dreams?

     CARTER

     (wincing)
     Well...to be honest, the technology is untested for use in this
     manner. Eh, dreams are much more random than conscious thought. It
     may be difficult for the system to translate what's going on in
     McKay's brain so that Colonel Sheppard can understand it. I'm just
     hoping that the two of them will be able to interact somehow.

   [They both look down into the other room.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Sheppard and McKay have leads attached to their heads and cardiac
   monitors. McKay has an IV. They look at each other across the gurneys.]

     MCKAY

     (to Sheppard)
     You sure about this?

     SHEPPARD
     Not really.

     MCKAY
     I'm pretty screwed up.

     SHEPPARD
     You're telling me.

     KELLER
     We're ready if you are.

     MCKAY

     (to Sheppard)
     Thanks.

     SHEPPARD
     I haven't done anything yet.

     MCKAY
     For trying. And don't say I didn't warn you!

     KELLER
     Administering sedative.

   [McKay falls asleep. Sheppard looks around.]

     SHEPPARD
     Nothing's happening here.

   [Keller watches a monitor.]

     KELLER
     He's not dreaming yet.

   EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY

   [McKay rows a rowboat in a terrible lightning and rain storm. Atlantis
   is in the far distance. McKay hears a whale. He stops rowing and sees
   the whale breach the surface.]

     MCKAY
     Oh boy. Nice whale. Nice whale. You're my friend. You don't want to
     eat me.

     SHEPPARD
     Give up. You'll never make it. You're too weak.

   [Sheppard sits in the stern of the boat, facing Rodney, arms crossed.
   He has on his black uniform rather than the sweater Sheppard was
   wearing in the isolation room.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, thank you. Thanks for the encouragement. Way to help out!

     SHEPPARD
     Why would I want to help you?

     MCKAY
     Because I thought you--

     SHEPPARD
     It's not me, Rodney. Don't listen to him.

   [The real Sheppard sits in the bow of the boat behind McKay.]

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     You're pathetic. You might as well jump in!

     SHEPPARD
     Don't be afraid.

   [McKay looks between the two Sheppards and shakes his head, trying not
   to panic.]

     MCKAY
     Oh God...I have to get back. I have to get back. That's my only
     chance.

   [He starts rowing again.]

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     You're gonna die out here!

     SHEPPARD
     Shut up! Don't listen to him, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     That's easy for you to say! Why don't you help me row!

   [Before McKay can turn back around, Sheppard appears beside him, taking
   an oar. McKay looks at Sheppard in surprise, then tries to row in
   rhythm with him.]

     SHEPPARD
     You know, this really isn't as strange as you led me to believe.

     MCKAY
     Oh yeah? What about that?

   [He points behind them. Sheppard turns and sees a frowning clown
   sitting in the bow.]

     SHEPPARD
     I hate clowns.

     MCKAY

     (looking around)
     Ah!

   [They redouble their rowing efforts.]

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     You can paddle all you want to. You're not going anywhere.

     MCKAY
     He's right. I'm gonna die out here!

     SHEPPARD
     He wants you to be afraid. Don't give him what he wants! He can't
     really hurt you.

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     That's where you're wrong.

   [From below them, a huge whale with shark-like jaws comes straight up
   out of the water and swallows the boat and its occupants whole.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Sheppard wakes, sweating, and starts to sit up. A monitor nearby
   flatlines.]

     SHEPPARD

     (disoriented)
     What happened?

     KELLER
     Clear!

   [She uses the defibrillator on McKay, who doesn't respond. Holding a
   respirator, Zelenka turns to Sheppard.]

     ZELENKA
     He's in cardiac arrest.

   [They perform CPR on McKay, but the monitor still shows no response.]

     KELLER
     I'm sorry. I've done all I can. He's dead.

   [In shock, Sheppard looks up at the observation room to the others'
   shocked faces.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard moves slowly through the corridor, still in shock. He stops
   as if he can't go on. Teyla approaches quickly.]

     TEYLA
     This is all your fault, John!

     RONON
     If you hadn't touched that stupid rock, McKay would still be alive
     right now.

     CARTER
     I thought you were going to help him!

     SHEPPARD
     I tried.

     KELLER
     Some friend you are.

     CARTER
     Colonel, you've been compromised. I'm relieving you of duty.

   [In the background, Sheppard sees his dream doppelganger watching.]

     SHEPPARD
     Son of a bitch.

   [He runs and tackles the other Sheppard. They fall through the wall as
   if it is an illusions.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

     KELLER
     Clear!

   [Keller uses the defibrillator on McKay. A sinus rhythm starts. McKay
   soon regains consciousness and looks around in confusion.]

     KELLER
     Oh, it's okay! It's okay. Just try to relax.

     MCKAY

     (disoriented)
     What's going on?

     KELLER
     You were in cardiac arrest.

     MCKAY
     The entity...?

     ZELENKA
     It's in Colonel Sheppard.

   [They all look over at Sheppard, lying unmoving on the bed.]

   INT--DREAM ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [The two Sheppards have landed on the floor of the Gate Room.
   Dream-Sheppard smirks as throws Sheppard off of him. They break apart
   and stand. The wormhole is active.]

     SHEPPARD
     You can quit now. I'm not afraid of you.

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     Oh, yes you are. I'm the one thing you are afraid of. You failed
     your friends. You brought this on them, and there is NOTHING you can
     do to stop it!

   [Sheppard attacks, and they exchange blows and kicks. Dream-Sheppard
   gains the advantage, knocking Sheppard to his knees. Sheppard still
   doesn't quit, but he is losing quickly. Dream-Sheppard throws him into
   a wall. He lands on the floor, dazed. Dream-Sheppard picks him up by
   the shirt and tosses him all the way up the staircase to the control
   room then walks up the steps after him. Sheppard barely gets to his
   feet before the punches again fall.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Keller studies the monitors above Sheppard's gurney.]

     KELLER
     His heart rate is dangerously high.

     CARTER

     (from control room)
     Can you wake him up?

     KELLER
     I could try, but in his physical state, that could make things
     worse.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, and the entity would still be in him.

     MCKAY
     Hook me up to him again.

   INT--DREAM ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Sheppard is able to land some punches, but Dream-Sheppard still has
   the advantage. He kicks Sheppard several times, finally knocking him
   over the railing and back onto the Gate Room floor. Dream-Sheppard
   leaps after him, landing on his feet.]

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     Get up! Come on, John. Fight!

   [Sheppard remains curled in a semi-fetal position while Dream-Sheppard
   approaches him.]

     SHEPPARD
     No. That's what you want.

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     It's your fault Heightmeyer's dead. Your fault McKay is dead!

     MCKAY
     I'm not dead!

   [Dream-Sheppard turns to see McKay walking down the staircase. Enraged,
   Dream-Sheppard rushes McKay, knocking him into a pillar.]

     DREAM-SHEPPARD
     You can't win.

     MCKAY
     Yes, we can. You're vulnerable to electric shock. That's why I'm
     still alive. You left before you could finish the job!

   [An electrical shock courses through Dream-Sheppard. He releases McKay
   and backs away, yelling in pain. A surprised Sheppard sits up.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell was that?

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Keller is using the defibrillator paddles to shock Sheppard. She does
   it again.]

   INT--DREAM ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Another shock courses through Dream-Sheppard, who's fallen to his
   knees. Sheppard gets up and grabs his doppelganger. They spin around as
   Sheppard gains momentum before tossing the other into the wormhole.
   McKay nervously approaches the survivor.]

     MCKAY
     Which one are you?

     SHEPPARD
     Me.

     MCKAY
     Good you or bad you?

     SHEPPARD
     Me me! Is that...you you?

     MCKAY
     I think so.

     SHEPPARD
     Thanks.

   [They both look around.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, this is really weird.

     SHEPPARD
     You're telling me.

     MCKAY
     I mean, I thought there'd be more...hot girls.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Zelenka sets the controls on the containment chamber where the entity
   has now returned to its crystal base. Keller removes the leads from
   McKay's head as he awakens. Sheppard also wakes up. They look at each
   other then settle back onto their pillows. Everyone in the control room
   is relieved.]

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET JUNGLE, NIGHT

   [The team, wearing hazmat suits, drop the two active crystals onto the
   forest floor. A strange song comes from them. All around the team, more
   crystals begin to light on neighboring trees, spreading throughout the
   jungle.]

     MCKAY
     Hey, I have an idea. How about we get out of here?

     SHEPPARD
     Sounds like a plan.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Sheppard sits at a table in the otherwise empty room. He eats a snack
   and reads. Teyla approaches.]

     TEYLA
     Couldn't sleep.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, me too.

   [She sits down.]

   [Later, McKay joins them with a full tray.]

     MCKAY
     I thought I'd have a little snack before I uh...

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we couldn't sleep either.

   [Soon Ronon joins them as well.]

   [Later, Keller and Carter round out the table.]

   FADE OUT
