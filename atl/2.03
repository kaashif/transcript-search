   TEASER

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Lorne and Parrish are walking through dense forest. Parrish is
   excitedly inspecting the plant life while Lorne shines the light of his
   P-90 around him.]

     LORNE
     You know, when they told me I'd be traveling to another galaxy,
     visiting strange new worlds, defending humanity against unimaginable
     alien threats, this just is not what I pictured.

     PARRISH
     We could be saving Earth right here, right now, Major.

     LORNE
     Oh, yeah? How's that?

     PARRISH
     Through a greater understanding of the long-term effects of severe
     ozone depletion on plant life. You may not want to admit it, but
     it's a real danger.

     LORNE
     Oh, yeah. Sure. Global warming, Wraith attack... I see the
     similarity now. You're right. Yeah, it's great.

   [Parrish wanders off a bit.]

     LORNE
     Hey, not too far, Doc, okay?

     PARRISH
     Oh, not to worry, Major. I don't think there's much chance any
     animal could survive the long-term effects of exposure to the
     sunlight on this planet.

     LORNE
     So, not a place to build a summer home?

     PARRISH

     (fascinated)
     It's the fact this vegetation is thriving.

   [Perspective is switched to an overhead view from the tree above them.]

     PARRISH
     Somehow, it's managed to persist despite what should be extremely
     destructive ionizing radiation.

   [Perspective is switched back to ground level.]

     PARRISH

     (excited)
     Oh, would you look at that?

   [Lorne aims his weapon and prepares to fire in the direction Parrish is
   looking. Parrish smiles and continues.]

     PARRISH

     (excited)
     Now, what is a Williamsonia Sewardiana doing here?

   [Parrish walks off towards the plant he had seen. Lorne looks around
   and notices something on the ground. He shines his light on it and
   crouches down for a closer look.]

     PARRISH
     Major!

   [Parrish is looking at something on the ground and Lorne runs to join
   him. There is a dead Wraith lying on the ground. There is obvious
   injury to the body and Lorne checks the blood, which is still wet.]

     LORNE
     Doesn't look like the sun killed him.

     PARRISH
     What do we do?

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     Coughlin, this is Lorne. Any activity?

     COUGHLIN

     (over radio)
     No, Sir.

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     I got a dead sucker here. Looks K.I.A. No more than a day old. We're
     on our way.

   [Lorne leaves two glow sticks on the ground by the body.]

     LORNE
     Come on, Doc. Let's get you back to the gate.

     PARRISH
     I... I don't understand.

     LORNE

     (grabbing Parrish by the shirt)
     Well, neither do I. All I know is he didn't do that to himself. Come
     on, let's go.

   [They walk off into the forest and we pan up the tree to see Ford
   sitting on a branch.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

     SHEPPARD

     (voice)
     Is the gate covered?

     LORNE

     (voice)
     Coughlin and Reed, yeah.

   INT--ATLANTIS, WEIR'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard and Lorne are in Weir's office. Teyla enters and Sheppard and
   Lorne update her.]

     SHEPPARD
     They found a dead Wraith. Shot several times.

     LORNE
     Looked like bullets, but it was hard to say.

     LORNE
     The guy was a mess.

     TEYLA
     The Genii use such weapons.

     WEIR
     Dr. Beckett is performing an autopsy.

   [The doors open and Beckett enters.]

     WEIR
     Here he is now.

     BECKETT
     I'm not done, not nearly but I thought you might like to know this.
     The enzyme sac in the right arm has been removed.

     SHEPPARD

     (stunned)
     Ford!

   [McKay enters.]

     MCKAY
     What's going on?

     SHEPPARD

     (snarkily)
     Thanks for coming, Rodney.

     MCKAY

     (defensively)
     I was... I was right in the middle of...

     WEIR
     P-three-M-seven-three-six. We found a dead Wraith... that may have
     been killed by Ford.

     SHEPPARD
     He could still be there.

     MCKAY
     Wait a second... seven... seven-three-six? The UV index there during
     the day something like a thousand.

     SHEPPARD

     (firmly)
     Bring your sunscreen. Be ready in ten minutes.

   [Sheppard leaves.]

     MCKAY

     (defensively)
     What?! I want to get Ford back as much as anyone else, but have you
     seen my complexion?

     TEYLA

     (rolling her eyes)
     Yes.

     MCKAY
     Yes, it's very fair.

   [Teyla leaves.]

     MCKAY
     Extremely fair.

   [Lorne leaves.]

     MCKAY
     This isn't fair.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard is running along the corridor and as he turns a corner,
   Caldwell calls after him.]

     CALDWELL
     Colonel.

   [Sheppard stops with a look of frustration on his face.]

     SHEPPARD
     Colonel.

     CALDWELL
     Something urgent?

     SHEPPARD
     I think we have a bead on Ford.

     CALDWELL
     So I heard.

     SHEPPARD
     That was fast.

   [They step into a transporter.]

     CALDWELL
     Base protocol dictates all senior officers be notified of situations
     code orange and above.

   [Sheppard taps the screen behind them, the transporter doors close and
   there a bright flash of light through the colored glass in the doors.]

     SHEPPARD
     Right. How does that go again? Red, orange, blue...

   [The doors open and they step out of the transporter.]

     SHEPPARD
     ...or the other way around? You mind if we go over that when I get
     back?

   [Sheppard is attempting to walk away, but Caldwell follows him up the
   stairs.]

     CALDWELL

     (firmly)
     Colonel.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, you don't have to remind me of our respective positions or
     that you outrank me, Sir.

     CALDWELL
     I was wondering if I needed to remind you. Lieutenant Ford is a
     significant threat to the security of this base.

     SHEPPARD
     He's also a friend in need.

     CALDWELL
     His condition forces him to seek out the Wraith. If he's caught, he
     would compromise...

   [Sheppard stops walking and turns to face Caldwell on the stairs just
   below him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I'm going to find him and I'm going to bring him back.

     CALDWELL
     According to Dr. Beckett's report, there may not be anything that
     can be done to help him.

   [Sheppard walks down three steps to face Caldwell.]

     SHEPPARD
     With all due respect, Sir, I hope you're not saying what I think
     you're saying.

     CALDWELL
     Lieutenant Ford has already proven resourceful enough to penetrate
     security and escape the city. I am saying if you encounter him and
     there is any chance whatsoever that his capture might prove elusive,
     you are duty-bound to eliminate the threat.

   [Sheppard bites his lower lip.]

     CALDWELL
     Lieutenant Ford may have been your friend, but he's not anymore. I
     know you understand. You'll do what's right. You didn't seem to have
     a problem with mercy when it came to Colonel Sumner.

   [Sheppard stares at him, clenching his jaw.]

     CALDWELL
     Dismissed.

   [Sheppard walks away.]

   EXT--P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT

   [The gate is on the edge of an open grassy area and two soldiers are
   standing guard. A Puddle Jumper flies through the open wormhole and
   comes to a stop near the edge of the clearing. We see through the front
   window that Sheppard and McKay are at the controls, Teyla and Lorne
   behind them. Sheppard brings up the H.U.D.]

     SHEPPARD
     Life-signs detector is useless.

     MCKAY
     I told you so.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER COCKPIT

     SHEPPARD
     Just preserving your streak of being right. Officially.

     MCKAY
     Dr. Parrish believes that the indigenous plant life retains enough
     residual radioactivity absorbed during the daylight to, um, well, to
     screw up our sensors.

     SHEPPARD
     Making it the perfect place to hide.

     MCKAY
     Yes...

   [Sheppard gets up and leaves the cockpit.]

     MCKAY

     (calling after Sheppard)
     Or the perfect place to be exposed to dangerously high levels of
     solar radiation!

   EXT--P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT

   [Lorne goes to the rear of the Puddle Jumper to speak to his men.]

     LORNE
     Any activity while we were gone?

     REED
     No, Sir.

   [Sheppard joins them. Behind him, Teyla is gearing up while McKay is
   applying cream to his face.]

     SHEPPARD

     Let's start a sweep. Teams of two. Radio contact every twenty
     minutes.
     (turning around to face McKay)
     How come it smells like I'm on vacation?

     MCKAY

     (smiling)
     Could it be the simulated tropical aroma of cocoa butter?

     SHEPPARD
     Strong enough for anyone within five miles to smell you.

     MCKAY
     Like they haven't been tipped off by the Aqua Velva?

     SHEPPARD
     It's dark.

     MCKAY

     (looking at his watch)
     Yeah, well, the sun will be up in two hours, forty-three minutes,
     and... ten seconds.

   [Sheppard and Teyla step out onto the grass.]

     SHEPPARD
     It's raining.

     MCKAY
     So we'll be cold and miserable. Look, the cloud cover will
     depreciate a small percentage of UV rays, but ninety-five percent of
     deadly is still deadly.

   [McKay continues applying the cream to his face and neck.]

     LORNE
     Dr. Parrish said a day or two of exposure wasn't going to kill us.

     MCKAY
     Oh, yes, and Dr. Parrish has a PhD in what? Right. Botany.

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla, you're with me, Coughlin, take Billick, Reed, you and Sherman
     cover the gate, and Major, you've got McKay.

   [The others move out, leaving Lorne and McKay.]

     LORNE
     Oh, lucky me.

     MCKAY
     Here. Try some. SPF one hundred.

     LORNE
     A hundred?

     MCKAY
     You can't buy this kind of protection. I make it myself. Waterproof,
     too.

     LORNE
     Great.

   [They exit the rear of the jumper and head out.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [The dead Wraith's weapon, several Wraith grenades and a number of glow
   sticks are lying on the ground where the body was found earlier.
   Sheppard and Teyla arrive on the scene. Sheppard picks up a grenade and
   turns it over in his hand.]

     SHEPPARD
     Do you have any idea what a lone Wraith would be doing around here
     on foot?

     TEYLA

     (surveying the area)
     No. It is unusual. Perhaps Lieutenant Ford was able to lure him
     through the gate.

   [Teyla sees something on the ground and crouches down to investigate.]

     TEYLA
     It looks as if someone might have headed off in this direction.

   [They move out.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Lorne and McKay are walking through another part of the forest.]

     MCKAY
     So exactly what kind of special training do you guys have to go
     through to get this sort of mission?

     LORNE
     "You guys"?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, you know. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. It's a great place
     to start.

     LORNE
     And by this mission, you mean hunting down a skilled weapons expert
     hopped up on Wraith drugs in the pitch black of an alien planet?

     MCKAY
     Yes.

     LORNE

     (snarkily)
     Actually, I skipped that course in major school.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I was afraid of that.

     LORNE
     I was hoping Lieutenant Ford might recognize a friendly face and
     just turn himself in.

     MCKAY

     (incredulous)
     What, you mean me?

     LORNE
     Well, you were friends, weren't you?

     MCKAY

     (sarcastically)
     Oh yeah. When we weren't out on harrowing missions, we used to hang
     out together. I'd share my dreams of a self-sustaining fusion. He
     would talk of how you could sever a man's torso with a P-90.

   [Lorne stops suddenly and raises one closed hand in the air as a
   signal.]

     MCKAY
     What, that means "quiet," right?

     LORNE

     (whispering)
     Yeah. Get down, get down.

   [They crouch down behind a tree stump.]

     MCKAY
     What? What?

     LORNE
     I thought I saw something move.

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Sheppard and Teyla are making their way through the forest when,
   suddenly, Teyla stops.]

     SHEPPARD
     What is it?

     TEYLA
     I heard something.

     SHEPPARD

     (calling out)
     Ford? Is that you? It's John.

     TEYLA

     (calling out)
     Aiden, listen to me. We want to help you. Please. Just come out. We
     only want to talk.

   [They hear a noise in the forest, raise their weapons and run towards
   it.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Lorne and McKay are still crouched down behind the tree stump. Lorne
   raises is eyebrows expectantly at McKay.]

     MCKAY

     (whispers)
     What?

     LORNE

     (quietly)
     Say something.

     MCKAY
     What?

     LORNE
     Talk to him.

     MCKAY
     What if it's not him?

   [Lorne grabs McKay by the shoulder and pushes him to his feet.]

     MCKAY

     (nervously)
     Ford? You there? It's your... best friend Rodney. Rodney McKay.
     Everyone... misses you back at Atlantis, and Dr. Beckett's figured
     out a way to help you, so you've just got to trust me and...

   [There is a rustling in the bushes and somebody in the distance moves
   off into the forest. Lorne pursues him and Rodney follows.]

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, it's Major Lorne. In pursuit of suspect.

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Teyla and Sheppard are running through the forest.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     What? So are we. Where are you?

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     We're two klicks south of the Stargate. Where are you?

   [Teyla runs into a small clearing where she is hit by a red energy
   weapon blast and falls to the ground. Sheppard stops and points his
   weapon towards where Teyla fell.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Lorne has stopped running and McKay catches up to him.]

     MCKAY
     What is it?

     LORNE

     I lost him.
     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard...

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Sheppard is still standing with his weapon ready.]

     SHEPPARD

     (quietly into radio)
     Stand by. Teyla's been hit.

   [Sheppard takes a few steps forward then is hit by the same red energy
   weapon blast and falls to the ground in pain.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Lorne and McKay are still standing in the forest.]

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, say again. What's your position?

   [Lorne is becoming concerned.]

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, please respond.

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Teyla and Sheppard are lying motionless on the ground. We see the
   scene from the perspective of someone walking between them.]

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, come in, please. Colonel Sheppard.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM BALCONY

   [Weir is on the balcony. The stargate is active in the gate room below
   her.]

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     We haven't heard from them since twenty-six thirty Atlantis Standard
     Time.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     I know the life signs detector doesn't work there, Major, but can
     you use the Jumper to search from the air?

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     No, ma'am. The foliage is far too dense for that.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     I'll send another team to assist.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON P3M-736

   [Lorne is in the cockpit speaking to Weir and McKay enters from the
   rear. Daylight can be seen through the window of the Puddle Jumper.]

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     Well, anyone you could spare would be great.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Anything else you need?

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Elizabeth, it's Rodney. Yes, hi. There are four class one radiation
     suits in med lab storage. We'll need them all.
     (to Lorne)
     What? Look, I know there's not enough for us all, but we can... take
     turns.

   [McKay leaves the cockpit.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Any sign of Lieutenant Ford yet?

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Uh, no, Ma'am. Not that we can confirm. The fact is, we don't even
     know if this is Lieutenant Ford we're dealing with.

   INT--P3M-736 CAVE

   [Teyla and Sheppard are sitting back-to-back, bound and unconscious.
   There is a man at the mouth of the cave, searching through their
   belongings. Sheppard regains consciousness but is clearly disoriented.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ford?

   [The man turns his face towards Sheppard, but it is not Ford. He looks
   at Sheppard then returns to his task. Teyla regains consciousness.]

     TEYLA
     Colonel?

     SHEPPARD
     You okay?

     TEYLA
     My head is pounding. Where are we?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know, but I was just about to ask him.

   [The man stands up and walks towards Sheppard and Teyla. He is carrying
   a P-90.]

     SHEPPARD
     You might want to be careful where you point that thing. Looks like
     you got the safety off.

   [The man readies the weapon to fire and points it at Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. Be that way, but my guess is if you wanted us dead, we'd be
     dead right now, so why don't you tell us who you are and what you
     want?

   [The man just stands looking at Sheppard, the P-90 trained on him.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, I'll go first. I'm Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

     TEYLA
     I am Teyla Emmagan.

     RONON
     Colonel?

     SHEPPARD
     It's my rank. Military designation.

     RONON
     Specialist Ronon Dex.

     SHEPPARD
     That's you?

     RONON
     Name and rank.

   [Ronon returns to where he had left their belongings, drops the P-90
   and continues searching.]

     SHEPPARD
     Military?

     RONON
     I used to be.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--SATEDA, DAY

   [Ronon and several other Satedan soldiers are under heavy fire. They
   are returning fire but they are clearly losing the battle. There are
   numerous Wraith darts flying through the air.]

     RONON

     (yelling to his comrades)
     Go! Move, move, move!

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--P3M-736 CAVE

     RONON
     It was a long time ago.

     SHEPPARD
     And now?

     RONON
     Now I'm deciding whether to kill you and your friends.

   [Sheppard and Teyla exchange glances over their shoulders.]

   EXT--P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, DAY

   [Lorne exits the Puddle Jumper rear hatch to address the waiting
   Marines. McKay follows him while putting on a red radiation suit.]

     LORNE
     Okay, listen up. I want regular radio contact. Report anything
     unusual, and I'm talking anything unusual at all. All right, move
     out.

     MCKAY

     (to the departing Marines)
     Hey, wait, aren't any of you going to... ah... Okay, that... that's
     just reckless. There are four suits.

     LORNE
     Not exactly designed for moving through dense brush and rough
     terrain, not to mention possible combat, huh?

   [Lorne continues his preparations while McKay talks.]

     MCKAY
     No, but by my calculations, we've been exposed to three hundred and
     twenty-seven millisieverts since the sun came up. May not sound like
     much to you, but I've been keeping a running tally of my lifetime
     exposure to radiation. That's, uh, X-rays, cellphones, plane rides,
     that whole unfortunate Genii nuclear reactor thing. My God, last
     week, we flew dangerously close to the corona of a sun. As it is, I
     may have to forego reproducing.

     LORNE
     Yeah, it's funny. I was just thinking that might be wise.

   [Lorne moves out and McKay follows, putting on the helmet to the suit.]

   INT--P3M-736 CAVE

   Ronon is crouched by the cave entrance, applying a reddish paste to his
   arms.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look... The men guarding the Stargate are highly trained soldiers
     armed with deadly weapons.

     RONON
     Stargate?

     SHEPPARD
     Stargate. Big circle thing.

     RONON
     I've always known it as the "Ring of the Ancestors." No matter. I
     have to make it through.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, we didn't come here looking for trouble. And the whole killing
     thing is really unnecessary.

     RONON
     If your friends try to stop me...

     SHEPPARD
     They won't, if I tell them not to. Untie us. We'll all go to the
     'gate together and you can be on your way.

     RONON
     But why should I trust you?

     SHEPPARD
     That's a good question. Teyla, why should he trust us?

     TEYLA
     We mean you no harm. We are only here searching for a friend.

   FLASHBACK

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, DAY

   [Ronon is running through the forest, being pursued by a Wraith. He is
   hit in the leg by a blast from the Wraith's stun weapon and stumbles
   over a fallen log. As he regains his footing, Ford steps out from
   behind a tree and raises his weapon.]

     FORD
     Drop it!

   [Ronon raises his weapon and points it at Ford. They stand looking at
   each other for a moment, then Ronon is hit in the back by the Wraith's
   stun weapon and falls to the ground. Ford shoots the Wraith, then
   smiles and unsheathes his knife. Ford steps over Ronon and goes over to
   the dying Wraith. Ronon gets up and escapes into the forest.]

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--P3M-736 CAVE

   [Ronon gets up and walks over to where Teyla and Sheppard are tied up.]

     RONON
     I saw him. Your friend.

     SHEPPARD
     Where? When?

     RONON
     He killed a Wraith who was hunting me.

     SHEPPARD
     Hunting you?

     RONON
     Why are you looking for him?

     TEYLA
     His name is Aiden Ford, and he is sick. He needs our help.

     I thought he'd been in the sun too long. It can make you sick here.

     SHEPPARD
     We know that, and that may be true, but that's not all that's wrong
     with him.

     RONON
     Then why is he running from you?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, he's not, exactly.

     RONON

     Well, what is he doing...
     (crouching down in front of Sheppard)
     ...exactly?

     SHEPPARD
     It's complicated.

     RONON
     You can do better than that.

     Colonel Sheppard? Teyla? This is Major Lorne. Do you read?

     MCKAY
     It's so hot.

     LORNE
     Oh, come on. Step it up, McKay, would you?

     MCKAY
     I am moving as fast as I can. I'm very hot. Aren't you hot?

     LORNE
     Actually, I'm quite comfortable, but I'm not wearing a fifty pound
     rubber suit, am I?

     MCKAY
     I can't breathe. I've got to stop.

   [McKay removes the helmet from the radiation suit.]

     MCKAY
     Sweet relief. I think the fumes from the sunblock were making me
     dizzy. I got to... I got to... just, uh...

   [McKay stops walking.]

     MCKAY
     ...rest here.

     LORNE
     Unbelievable.

     He killed the Wraith... got an overdose of the drug. It kind of
     messed him up.

     TEYLA
     But we think we can help him if we can find him.

   [Static can be heard from a radio amongst Sheppard and Teyla's
   belongings.]

     RONON
     What is that?

     SHEPPARD
     Radios.

     TEYLA
     Communication devices.

     SHEPPARD
     Our people are trying to contact us. The cave must be causing some
     interference with the signal.

   [Ronon picks up a tac vest and takes it outside the cave to investigate
   the radio. Teyla starts to wriggle.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you doing?

     TEYLA
     Getting my hand free.

     SHEPPARD
     Doesn't feel that way.

     LORNE
     Okay, you've had your fresh air. Come on, let's go.

     MCKAY
     Well, shouldn't we be headed back? I mean, it's been half an hour.

     LORNE
     It's been 15 minutes.

     MCKAY
     Oh, really? I thought... it feels longer.

     LORNE
     Wow, you must really be some kind of genius.

   [Lorne starts walking away and McKay gets up to follow him.]

     MCKAY
     Well, as a matter of fact, I, um... wait a minute. See, why would
     you say that now?

     LORNE
     Something has to have kept Colonel Sheppard from shooting you all
     this time.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, yeah, like I didn't see that one coming.

   [A blast from a Wraith stun weapon hits Lorne in the chest and he is
   knocked to the ground. McKay pulls out his radio.]

     MCKAY

     (frantically)
     Mayday! Mayday! We are under attack. Lorne's been hit. I repeat, we
     are under Wraith attack!

   [McKay pulls out his sidearm, aiming it in the direction from which the
   Wraith weapon fire came. Ford steps out from behind a tree, aiming a
   Wraith weapon at McKay.]

     FORD
     Will you relax, McKay?

     MCKAY
     Ford!

     FORD
     How about you drop your gun? I know what you're like with weapons. I
     wouldn't want it accidentally going off while it's pointed at me.

   [Ford walks up and takes the gun from McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Right.

     FORD
     Good.

   [Ford gives McKay a tap on the shoulder then a couple of friendly taps
   on the chest.]

     FORD

     (smiling)
     Now you and me can catch up.

   [Ford goes over to where Lorne is lying unconscious on the ground and
   removes the spare bullet cartridge from his tac vest.]

     REED

     (over radio)
     Dr. McKay, what is your position? Please respond.

   [Ford takes the radio from McKay's hand.]

     REED
     Major Lorne, come in...

   [Ford switches the radio off and tosses it to where Lorne is lying.]

     FORD
     Let's go.

     MCKAY
     We... we can't leave Major Lorne.

     FORD
     He'll be fine.

     MCKAY
     No, I...

   [Ford points the Wraith weapon and McKay's own gun at him.]

     MCKAY
     You know that the sunlight on this planet is kind of dangerous.

     FORD
     Not for me.

     MCKAY
     Well, actually...

     FORD
     Listen, McKay, you guys all think I'm crazy or something...

     MCKAY
     No, no one thinks that.

     FORD
     Sure. Here's the thing. I'm not just fine. I'm better than fine.
     Really. This is the best thing that ever happened to me.

     MCKAY
     Well, good. Good for you.

     FORD

     (defensively)
     I can prove it. You just have to give me the chance to prove it.

     MCKAY
     Sure. Let's, um... let's head back to the Jumper...

     FORD
     No way. First, I'm going to prove to you that I'm okay, that things
     are better this way, and then you can go back and tell the others,
     and then they'll let me come back.

     MCKAY
     You can come back to Atlantis right now. Dr. Beckett is...

     FORD
     No. First we have to save Major Sheppard and Teyla.

     MCKAY
     Wait, you... you know where they are?

     FORD
     Yeah.

     MCKAY
     Which way did you...

   [Ford points and they start walking in that direction.]

     FORD
     So obviously the Wraith didn't destroy Atlantis.

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

     FORD
     Anything else happen since I've been gone?

     MCKAY
     Uh, Major Sheppard got promoted to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

     FORD

     (smiling)
     Really?

     MCKAY
     Yeah.

     FORD

     Good for him.

     Yeah.

     Keep your hands where I can see them.

   [Teyla comes out of the cave holding the other P-90, trained on Ronon.
   Ronon puts the radio back in the tac vest pocket and holds the vest
   down by his side.]

     RONON
     I told you I have to get through the ring.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     RONON
     Because the Wraith are coming.

     SHEPPARD
     How do you know?

     RONON
     I know. They're hunting me.

     SHEPPARD
     Join the club.

     TEYLA

     You are a Runner.

   [Ronon gives her a small nod of acknowledgement.]

     TEYLA
     I have heard stories, but...

     SHEPPARD
     What's a Runner?

     RONON

     Don't do it. Like I said, we're not here to get in your way.

     That's good.

   the weapons fire, pulls out his gun and shoots Teyla in the chest then
   Sheppard in the hand, knocking his gun from his hand. When Sheppard
   regains his footing, Ronon has the weapon pointed in his face.]

     And you say this "guy" has them?

     FORD
     Yeah.

     MCKAY
     What guy?

     FORD
     I don't know. What do you mean, "What guy?" A guy! Look, I was on a
     Wraith planet. Uh, P-three-X... P-three-X-four-four-seven?
     Four-four-seven? I know the address.

     MCKAY
     And there are Wraith there?

     FORD
     Yeah. A whole hive ship. Anyway, I was scouting the place out,
     looking for the best way in so I could kill a couple.

     MCKAY
     What, for the enzyme?

     FORD
     Exactly. McKay, I'm telling you, it's the key to defeating them. We
     could create a whole army of supermen like me.

     MCKAY

     (frustrated)
     You were saying?

     FORD
     What?

     MCKAY
     About the guy!

     FORD
     Right. So this one Wraith, armed to the teeth, comes walking towards
     the gate. I figured one Wraith by himself is easy pickings, so I
     followed him here to this planet. Anyway, I think he was looking for
     the guy.

     MCKAY
     How do you know?

     FORD
     Well, he was running from the Wraith when I killed the sucker.

     MCKAY
     Okay, so what does the guy want with Sheppard and Teyla?

     FORD
     I don't know, but when I save them, you'll find out.

     I'll order my men not to stop you.

     You can tell them in person. I'm taking you with me.

     SHEPPARD
     You know, there's a chance we could help you.

     RONON
     How?

     SHEPPARD
     We know a pretty good doctor. Maybe he could take that tracking
     device out of you.

     RONON
     You think I haven't tried?

     SHEPPARD
     Suit yourself.

   [Ronon contemplates this for a moment then half lowers his weapon.]

     RONON
     And why would you do that?

     SHEPPARD
     Because I'm a nice guy. Look, I told you, you hate the Wraith, we
     hate the Wraith. It's something we all have in common. We just want
     our friend back.

     RONON
     You get this tracking device out of me, I'll get your friend back

     WEIR
     Yeah, something like that. And apparently, you don't have much time.
     The Wraith could show up any minute.

     Oh, it's getting better all the time. Have they found Lieutenant
     Ford yet?

     WEIR
     No. I haven't told you about McKay yet either. Come on, pack up what

     How do you know?

     MCKAY
     We've been walking around in circles for hours.

     FORD

     (becoming hysterical)
     So that's it? You just give up? Is that it? That's what you do,
     isn't it? You just... you give up on your friends when they need you
     most.

     MCKAY
     No one's given up on you, Ford. We want to help you.

     FORD
     I'm talking about Major Sheppard and Teyla!

     MCKAY
     Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

     FORD
     Oh, right. Lieutenant Colonel. So Ford's lost it. Ford's all crazy.
     Ford can't even remember a simple little thing!

     MCKAY
     Hey, I never said that, although the fact that you keep referring to
     yourself in the third person does indicate clinical dissociation.

     FORD

     (shouting)
     You don't even know what a friend is, do you, McKay? All you care
     about is yourself.

     MCKAY
     Will you relax? I just...

     FORD

     (raving)
     You relax. You're pathetic. You're always making fun of me. You want
     to play a game of "pick on Ford"? I could shoot you and leave you
     here to die.

     MCKAY
     Shoot me? When did this escalate to physical violence?

     FORD

     You're the one who thinks I'm nuts! I'm capable of anything.
     (pointing his P-90 at McKay)
     I could go off at any time!

     MCKAY

     (shouting hysterically)
     All right, you want to shoot me, shoot me. Fine. I don't care. It'll
     just save me from suffering one of the many horribly painful deaths
     I have in line for me having been exposed to this much radiation,
     and quite frankly, it'll prove just how far gone you are.

   [McKay turns around and starts to walk away.]

     MCKAY
     Now, I'm heading back to the Jumper, and you're welcome to join me!

   [Ford fires the P-90 over McKay's head.]

     MCKAY

     (screaming)
     Are you crazy? You could have killed me!

     FORD

     (horrified)
     I'm sorry.

   [They stand at look at each other for a moment.]

     FORD
     Look, you don't know what it's like, almost dying like I did, having
     your friends turn on you, no one trusts you... I'm out here all
     alone.

     MCKAY
     You don't have to be alone, Ford. Look, this drug is messing with
     your head. Come back to the Jumper with me, we'll go back to
     Atlantis, and Dr. Beckett may even be able to figure out a way for
     you to keep all your new super powers.

     FORD

     (tempted)
     You think?

     MCKAY
     Sure, why not?

     FORD
     First we've got to save Colonel Sheppard and Teyla.

     MCKAY
     No, no, wait...

     No, that'll prove that I'm okay.

     TEYLA
     How long have you been on the run?

     RONON
     Seven years.

     TEYLA
     And you've been on your own all that time?

     RONON
     Not much choice.

     TEYLA
     Afraid of bringing the Wraith down on anyone you were with.

     RONON
     Can't go home. Can't stay in one place for too long.

     TEYLA
     Why do you think they do it?

     RONON
     I don't know. Sport. Training. To learn how we fight. Measure our
     will to survive. You said, uh... you heard stories... about others
     like me.

     TEYLA
     Yes, I've heard of Runners my whole life, but I've never met one. I
     did not even believe it was true.

     RONON
     One time I accidentally came across a planet with a village near the
     ring.

     TEYLA
     What happened?

     RONON
     I stayed. One night. Ate a real meal for a change. Left right away
     the next day. Didn't matter. I later heard... the whole village...

     All right, for what it's worth, I'd never send you in there if I
     thought the guy was going to hurt you.

     BECKETT

     (quietly)
     Is that opinion based on some sort of evidence, or is it just a gut
     feeling that this gentleman isn't dangerous?

     SHEPPARD

     (quietly)
     I didn't say he wasn't dangerous. He could probably kill you in the
     blink of an eye. I don't think he will.

     BECKETT
     Well, thank you. I feel much better now.

     SHEPPARD
     You ever heard of Androcles and the lion?

     BECKETT
     Aye, and who are you in this retelling? The Romans?

   [Sheppard gestures to the top of the outcrop.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'll be right up there. Go.

   at Sheppard.]

     Hello. I normally don't make house calls like this, but then again,
     this isn't really a house, is it?

     RONON
     What's in the case, Doc?

     BECKETT
     Surgical implements, diagnostic tools, various drugs. Analgesics,
     antibiotics...

     RONON
     What?

     TEYLA
     Ronon, Dr. Carson Beckett. Dr. Beckett, Ronon.

     BECKETT
     Pleasure.

   [Beckett goes to a large rock, puts down his bag and case and begins
   preparations.]

     BECKETT
     I understand you have some sort of a transmitter in your back. Well,
     have a seat. Off with your shirt. Let's have a look.

   [Ronon sits on the rock and gestures to Teyla with the weapon.]

     RONON
     Little help?

   [Teyla and Beckett help remove Ronon's leather armor. When Teyla
   removes the front part, she sees a long scar on his chest and a
   necklace made from a Wraith finger bone. She looks at it, horrified.
   Meanwhile, Beckett is looking at Ronon's back. There is an area of
   heavy scarring near the top, right by the spine.]

     BECKETT
     My God. Tell me you didn't try to cut this thing out yourself.

     RONON
     Yeah, I tried once with a mirror. Couldn't quite reach. Most of it's
     from two different doctors.

     BECKETT

     (appalled)
     No one I know who calls himself a doctor would do this.

   [Beckett takes a hand-held scanner from the case and starts to use it
   on Ronon's back. Meanwhile, Sheppard is in position on the outcrop
   above. He has his weapon aimed at Ronon and it watching him through the
   sight.]

     RONON
     Is that Ancestor technology?

     BECKETT
     That it is.

   [The scanner screen shows Ronon's spine and the transmitter embedded
   beside it.]

     BECKETT
     Son, you're going to have to put that weapon down and lie down.

     RONON
     Not a chance.

     BECKETT
     Now, you listen to me. I've located the transmitter. It's in the
     soft tissue next to the second thoracic vertebra.

     RONON
     Good. Cut it out.

     BECKETT
     I can't do that with you sitting up like this, and I'm going to have
     to give you some anesthetic to make you sleep.

     RONON
     No, you're not.

     BECKETT
     Excuse me?

     TEYLA
     Ronon, you need to trust us.

   [Ronon points his weapon at Teyla.]

     RONON
     I do. That's why he's here and you're still alive. Now, get to work,
     Doc.

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Ford and McKay are still walking through the forest.]

     MCKAY
     Look, if you'd just turn on your radio, we could hear what's
     happening. The others must have called for backup by now. Maybe
     Sheppard and Teyla don't even need rescuing anymore.

   [Ford pushes McKay behind a tree.]

     MCKAY
     Ow!

     FORD
     Shh.

     MCKAY
     Ow.

   [Ford gives McKay back his sidearm.]

     FORD
     Someone's coming.

     MCKAY
     What do I need this for?

   [Ford walks off, leaving McKay hiding behind the tree.]

   EXT--P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, NIGHT

   There is a light set up and Beckett is wearing a surgical headset with
   lights, ready to operate.]

     BECKETT
     Okay, I'm ready. Look, I just want to say one last time. I really
     don't think this is a good idea. I'm going to be cutting very close
     to your spinal column here. If you were to flinch...

     RONON
     I won't flinch.

     BECKETT
     Okay. Here we go.

   Beckett operates to remove the transmitter. Ronon's expression is
   determined, but he is clearly in agony. He is having trouble holding
   his gun. Sheppard continues to watch from the top of the outcrop.]

     BECKETT
     I think I've got it.

   [He removes the transmitter from Ronon's back and turns to put it in a
   dish. When he does, Ronon passes out and falls to the ground.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Two Marines are making their way stealthily through the forest. They
   hear a noise, turn the lights on their weapons off and point them at a
   spot ahead where McKay jumps out from behind the tree where he had been
   hiding.]

     MCKAY
     Hold it! Don't shoot! It's just me!

   [As McKay is standing with his arms raised, the Marines are shot by
   Wraith stun weapon fire from above. Ford appears.]

     FORD
     What the hell are you doing, McKay?

     MCKAY
     What the hell am I doing? What the hell are you doing? Those are our
     guys!

     FORD
     I can't trust them.

     MCKAY
     Oh, that's it.

   [McKay points the handgun at Ford.]

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I've had it. Drop your weapons now!

   [Ford laughs.]

     FORD

     (incredulous)
     You're going to shoot me?

     MCKAY
     I will if I have to. Ford, I'm taking you in. Look, you may not
     believe this, but it's for your own good.

   [Ford begins to raise his weapon towards McKay, but McKay fires first,
   hitting Ford in the upper arm. Ford is seemingly not bothered by the
   wound, he just touches it. He looks at his bloody fingers for a moment,
   then stares at McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, boy.

   [McKay runs off into the forest.]

   EXT--P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, NIGHT

   [Teyla is crouching beside the still unconscious Ronon. Sheppard has
   arrived on the scene and is pointing his P-90 at him anyway.]

     BECKETT
     I'm quite certain I've disabled the device.

     TEYLA
     It may be too late.

   [Teyla, Sheppard and Beckett walk away from Ronon.]

     SHEPPARD
     We know at least one Wraith tracked Ronon here. I'm going to go look
     for McKay and Ford.

     TEYLA
     Yes, we will be fine.

     BECKETT
     Now that the lion's passed out cold.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm going to pick you up with the Jumper as soon as...

   [Weapons fire can be heard. Sheppard runs to investigate.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [McKay is running through the forest, firing straight up over his head
   as he goes.]

     MCKAY
     Help me! Help me!

   [McKay runs out of bullets and squeals.]

   EXT--P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT

   [Lorne is standing guard near the Jumper. The Stargate begins to
   activate.]

     LORNE
     Cloak the Jumper! Now!

   [Lorne and his men take up positions behind trees near the Jumper and
   watch as the Stargate activates.]

     LORNE

     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, we got gate activity.

   [Three Wraith darts fly from the open wormhole.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Sheppard is running through the forest.]

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Three Wraith darts just came through.

     SHEPPARD
     Great.

   EXT--P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, NIGHT

     TEYLA
     We should head back inside!

   [Teyla and Beckett run back to where they had left Ronon unconscious on
   the ground, but he is gone. While Beckett goes and picks up a weapon,
   Teyla checks inside the cave. She comes back out seconds later.]

     TEYLA
     He went through there.

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [McKay is still running through the forest. He runs into a small
   clearing where his foot is caught in a snare and he is lifted into the
   air, upside-down.]

     MCKAY
     You've got to be kidding me!

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Sheppard is running through the forest.]

     TEYLA

     (over radio)
     Colonel, Ronon is gone. There's another way out of the cave.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Get back to the Jumper.

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST CLEARING, NIGHT

   [McKay is dangling upside-down as Ford approaches the clearing.]

     FORD

     (laughs)
     Well, look at you.

     MCKAY
     Yes, look at me. It's funny, huh?

   [Ford laughs.]

     MCKAY
     Did you set this up? That's clever.

     FORD
     Wasn't me.

     MCKAY
     No, huh? Well, I'm glad we can both... still laugh about this
     together. Ha, ha... How about cutting me down now?

     FORD

     (smiling)
     No.
     (serious)
     I think I'm still going to kill you.

     MCKAY
     What? What do you mean, "still"? When did this escalate to killing?

     FORD
     When you shot me.

     MCKAY
     It's a flesh wound! I knew it wasn't going to hurt you! You're...
     you're SuperFord. Remember?

     FORD

     (shouting)
     You tried to kill me!

   [Ford aims his P-90 at McKay.]

     MCKAY

     (frantic)
     Wait! You can't kill an unarmed upside-down man!

   [Ford is crash tackled from the side. As he and Ronon roll on the
   ground, Ford's gun fires.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Sheppard hears the shots and takes off in the direction from which
   they came.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST CLEARING, NIGHT

   [Ford and Ronon are locked in hand-to-hand combat while McKay hangs
   from the trap, watching helplessly. Sheppard arrives on the scene and
   aims his weapon at Ford.]

     SHEPPARD
     Lieutenant!

   [Ford stoops to pick up his Wraith weapon.]

     SHEPPARD
     Don't.

   [The three Wraith darts fly overhead and as Sheppard looks up, Ford
   runs off.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ford!

   [Sheppard takes of after Ford. Ronon walks over to where McKay is
   dangling.]

     MCKAY
     Hi. It's Dr. Rodney McKay.

   [McKay holds out his hand.]

     MCKAY
     Could you, um...get me down, please?

   [Ronon just looks at him.]

   EXT--P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT

   [Ford is running through the forest, pursued by Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ford!

   [Ford stops and turns to face Sheppard as the Wraith darts are running
   their beams across the area.]

     SHEPPARD
     Keep your hands where I can see them.

   [Ford raises his hands.]

     SHEPPARD
     We want to help.

   [Ford lowers his right hand and goes for his sidearm. Sheppard shoots
   him in the thigh, but Ford continues to unholster his gun, which he
   points at Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD
     You're not getting off this planet.

   [A Wraith beam is getting closer.]

     FORD
     I'll show you. You'll see!

   [Ford leaps into the path of the beam. Sheppard watches him disappear
   and the dart fly away.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Sheppard, McKay and Teyla are briefing Weir and Caldwell.]

     SHEPPARD
     After they scooped up Ford, the darts made a beeline for the gate.
     We tried to stop them, but...

     CALDWELL
     You had him in your sights, and you let him get away.

     SHEPPARD
     I shot him once. It didn't slow him down.

     MCKAY

     (raising his finger)
     I shot him too.

     SHEPPARD
     He ran into the beam.

     WEIR
     Are you suggesting he wanted to be taken?

     SHEPPARD
     I think he saw it was the only way off the planet.

     MCKAY
     I can tell you from the quality time I spent with Ford, he was
     definitely not thinking straight.

     CALDWELL
     Now, thanks to you, he's in enemy hands with information that could
     compromise all of us.

   [Caldwell starts to walk away.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't think he'll give us away.

   [Caldwell stops and turns around to face Sheppard.]

     CALDWELL
     Oh, thank you so much for your assurance, Colonel. I'll be sure to
     include your feelings in my report.

   [Caldwell leave the room. The others exchange looks.]

   INT--ATLANTIS, RONON'S QUARTERS

   [There are two guards stationed by the door. Sheppard enters, gives
   them a nod and they step outside. Ronon is sitting on the bed.]

     SHEPPARD
     How's it going?

     RONON
     This place is impressive.

     SHEPPARD
     Those Ancestors sure could build 'em.

     RONON
     The guards are unnecessary.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, with your habit of taking people hostage and all...

     RONON
     I meant, should I want to escape, they would not be able to stop me.

     SHEPPARD
     Right.

     RONON
     Were you able to contact my home-world?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's why I'm here.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Ronon, Sheppard and Weir are looking at a monitor, which shows a city
   which has been utterly destroyed.]

     RONON
     I don't understand.

     WEIR
     We have machines called MALPs. They're capable of transmitting back
     images and information from other planets. We sent this one to the
     address you gave us.

     RONON
     That is Sateda?

     SHEPPARD
     I'm sorry. It doesn't look like anyone survived the last attack.

   [Ronon has a pained look on his face and after a glance at Sheppard and
   Weir, he walks out.]

   FADE OUT
