   TEASER

   EXT--SPACE

   [A puddle jumper flies through an incoming active Spacegate.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard's team and Keller are inside.]

     MCKAY
     I still say we should've brought backup. Another jumper or a marine
     unit, something.

     TEYLA
     This is intended to be a diplomatic mission, Rodney. What kind of
     message would that send?

     MCKAY
     Well, a strong one, hopefully.

     SHEPPARD

     (firmly)
     Yeah, everybody's going to be fine if they don't panic.

     MCKAY
     Easier said than done.

     SHEPPARD
     There they are.

   [A hive ship appears through the window.]

     KELLER

     (gasping)
     My God. How big is that thing?

     SHEPPARD
     Never seen a hive in space, huh?

     KELLER

     (panicky)
     I've never seen one, period. I mean, I've seen video logs, but never
     in person.

     MCKAY

     (absently)
     Well, you never forget your first.

     RONON
     They know we're here.

   [The console beeps.]

     MCKAY
     Apparently. We're receiving a transmission.

   [Sheppard peeks over to McKay's console.]

     SHEPPARD
     Docking instructions.

     MCKAY

     (sarcastic)
     What, no "hello, greetings, weary travelers?"

     SHEPPARD
     Guess not. So much for the red carpet.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper flies into the hive docking bay.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The team look distinctly nervous and uncomfortable as they land inside
   the hive ship.]

     KELLER
     So, what happens now?

     MCKAY
     Well, if history has taught us anything, this is the part where we
     get double-crossed and taken prisoner.

     TEYLA
     That will not happen this time, Rodney. We were invited, remember?

     MCKAY

     (grumbling)
     And that makes a difference?

   [There is a pounding on the outer door. Sheppard grimaces.]

     SHEPPARD
     Right on cue.

   [They all get up and head to the back. Sheppard hits the button to
   lower the door and raises his rifle. Three Wraith guards are standing
   outside, aiming weapons at the team--a standoff.]

     SHEPPARD
     This looks a little familiar.

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

     TODD

     (to his men)
     Lower your weapons.

   [The soldiers comply.]

     TODD

     (to team)
     My apologies. You understand. You can't be too careful. Welcome to
     my ship.

   [He holds his hands out in a grand gesture.]

   INT--WRAITH CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Todd leads the team to a room furnished with a long wooden table and
   several wooden chairs.]

     TODD
     This is my second-in-command. I've asked him to be a part of these
     discussions. Please...sit.

   [They cautiously take seats around the table.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hmm. Fruit bowl. Nice touch.

     TODD
     Well, we picked them up on our travels. I thought it would make our
     discussions more...comfortable. I hope they prove as delicious as
     the farmers who grew them.

   [McKay looks nonplussed and drops the fruit he holds.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, let's just get this over with.

     TODD
     So, I understand you have a proposal. A breakthrough of some kind?

     SHEPPARD

     (nodding to Keller)
     This is Doctor Keller. She's our Chief Medical Officer, and she's
     going to explain everything to you.

     KELLER

     (clears throat nervously)
     Well, um...uh, as you may already know, we recently stumbled across
     a lab belonging to Michael--the Wraith that we--

     TODD
     I know who he is.

     KELLER
     Uh--of course you do.

     TODD
     Word of your success against him spread rapidly among my kind. We
     are very grateful.

     SHEPPARD
     Trust me, we didn't do it for you.

     KELLER
     Anyway, we recovered a database from his lab that allowed us to
     continue his research into--

     TODD

     (sharply interrupting)
     For what purpose?

     KELLER
     We've come up with a gene therapy that alters Wraith DNA in a small
     but significant way. In a nutshell, we think we can make it so that
     you, and any other Wraith we treat, will never need to feed on
     humans again.

   [Todd and his second in command exchange sharp looks.]

     WRAITH SECOND
     This is absurd.

     KELLER
     Well, actually, it's...not as big of a change as you might think.
     Your bodies already contain all the organs necessary to digest food.

     SHEPPARD
     Here. Try this.

   [Sheppard tosses Todd a piece of fruit.]

     TODD
     If I consume this, it may give me a moment's pleasure, but it will
     not sustain me.

   [He sets the fruit firmly down on the table.]

     KELLER
     But that can change. At least...in theory.

     WRAITH SECOND
     Why would we want this? Of what benefit is it?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, think about it. If you put yourself on regular food, you could
     give up all those tiresome cullings.

     TEYLA
     It would give you a significant advantage over other hives.

     SHEPPARD
     Not to mention, I could stop waiting for the chance to kill you...in
     theory.

     WRAITH SECOND
     Our current feeding process gives us strength, our ability to heal,
     our longevity.

     KELLER
     Well, um, we're not entirely sure how this change would affect your,
     um...gifts. They may continue, although possibly in a diminished
     form.

     TODD
     Possibly?

     KELLER
     It's difficult to know from lab tests. We can't be sure until we
     administer it to, um, live subjects.

     MCKAY
     Well, let's not forget that Michael spread the modified Hoffan drug
     to dozens of worlds, possibly more. I mean, no one knows for sure,
     right? Which means that every time you feed? You're taking a risk.

     SHEPPARD
     Bottom line is, there's not enough food to go around. That's why you
     Wraith are at each other's throats, so...here's your chance.

   [Todd considers this.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship floats in space.]

   INT--WRAITH CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Todd and his second are now gone. The Atlantis team waits in the room.
   Ronon paces.]

     RONON
     This is wrong. We shouldn't be here.

     MCKAY
     I don't know, from where I was sitting, things seemed to go pretty
     well.

     SHEPPARD

     (flatly)
     Yeah.

     KELLER

     (curious)
     You don't seem too happy about it.

     SHEPPARD
     I was just expecting a little more resistance.

     KELLER
     Well, he hasn't said yes yet.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but something makes me think he wants to.

     TEYLA
     And why not? It is a reasonable offer.

     RONON
     Why are we thinking of ways to fix them when we should be thinking
     of ways to kill them?

     MCKAY
     We've been trying to do that for four years. They're still here!

     TEYLA

     (firmly)
     The Wraith may not deserve our consideration. But as John pointed
     out, we're not doing this for them.

     SHEPPARD
     There's something going on here. Something he's not telling us.

     RONON

     (sarcastic)
     What a surprise.

   [Sheppard and Teyla stand as footsteps approach. Ronon turns and primes
   his weapon as Todd arrives. Ronon lowers his gun.]

     TODD
     I'm sorry. Am I disturbing you?

   [Sheppard gives a falsely bright smile and gestures a welcome.]

     SHEPPARD
     Come in.

     TODD
     I have...considered your offer.

     SHEPPARD
     That was fast.

     TODD
     I believe your idea has merit...if you can make the treatment work.

     KELLER
     It'll work.

     TODD
     Of course, converting a single hive would be pointless. It would
     make little difference to the humans of this galaxy and would make
     us pariahs amongst our own kind.

   [While Todd speaks, Ronon lounges in a chair in an exaggeratedly casual
   gesture. He never takes his eyes off the Wraith, nor his hand off his
   gun.]

     MCKAY
     Wait a minute. I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.

     TODD
     I do, but I may have...exaggerated my position within the alliance.

     SHEPPARD
     He doesn't have the clout.

     RONON

     (sneering)
     Then he's no good to us.

     TODD
     There's only one you need to convince. Among all the queens in the
     alliance, one sits above the rest. We call her...the Primary.

     MCKAY
     The uber-queen?

     TODD
     Convince her, and the rest will fall into line.

     SHEPPARD
     Then convince her!

     TODD
     She will only speak with another queen.

     TEYLA
     And your queen was killed last year in the skies above Atlantis.

     TODD
     Regrettably, yes. But the Primary does not know this.

     SHEPPARD

     (incredulous)
     You...you bluffed your way into the alliance and convinced them you
     still have a queen?

     TODD
     They would not have accepted me otherwise. Up to now, I've been able
     to maintain this subterfuge, but a face-to-face meeting...that would
     be difficult. In fact, there is only one person who could help me.

   [He looks pointedly at Teyla, who stares back at him in surprise.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla and Sheppard are in his quarters.]

     SHEPPARD
     This is crazy.

     TEYLA
     Believe me, this is not a decision I am taking lightly.

     SHEPPARD
     Do you realize what he's asking you to do?

     TEYLA
     Doctor Keller assures me that the procedure is completely reversible
     and will have no lasting ill effects.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not talking about the procedure.

     TEYLA

     (quietly)
     I know.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, even if this works, even if all the Wraith stop feeding, you
     think they're gonna become nice and friendly overnight? No. They're
     going to have a massive technological advantage.

     TEYLA
     You're suggesting they will enslave the people of this galaxy rather
     than feed on them?

     SHEPPARD
     We've seen the same thing happen in our galaxy.

     TEYLA
     You didn't voice this objection before.

     SHEPPARD
     Nobody was asking you to risk your life.

     TEYLA
     My Wraith DNA makes me the only possible candidate. Anyone else
     would be detected by the queen immediately.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's fine. But-but my question is, why now? The Wraith are
     busy killing each other. Why don't we just sit back and watch?

     TEYLA
     Eventually, one faction will emerge victorious, and then everything
     will go back to the way it was.

     SHEPPARD
     But maybe not for a while, so we can afford to wait.

     TEYLA
     And if Todd's alliance is destroyed? We may never have another
     opportunity like this again. I admit, this may not solve the Wraith
     problem once and for all. But there are people alive today who will
     be culled in the coming weeks and months. And if I can save even
     some of them...I have to try. If not for myself, then for my son.

     BANKS

     (over intercom)
     Colonel Sheppard, come in.

     SHEPPARD
     This is Sheppard, go ahead.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     BANKS

     (into radio)
     Mr. Woolsey wanted me to inform you sir...he's here.

   [Banks looks down to the Stargate, where Todd, escorted by an Atlantis
   team, arrives through the active wormhole.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD

   [Teyla sits up on a surgical bed, dressed in a hospital gown. Keller is
   in scrubs beside her. Other infirmary staff prepare equipment.]

     KELLER
     You sure you're ready for this?

     TEYLA

     (nodding)
     As ready as I'll ever be.

     KELLER
     I'm sorry. I...I feel like you're being pressured into this because
     of my research.

     TEYLA
     I am not being pressured into anything. And your research may save
     thousands, even millions of lives. Remember that.

     KELLER
     Right.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Todd and his guard escort approach the infirmary. Ronon blocks his
   path, glowering menacingly at Todd.]

     TODD
     Can I help you?

     RONON
     Just remember...if anything happens to her, there won't be anywhere
     in the galaxy you can hide.

     TODD
     Ah. Is that all?

   [Ronon sneers in challenge, but steps aside.]

     TODD
     Right.

   [Todd continues on his way.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD

   [Todd enters. Teyla lies on the table, still conscious.]

     TODD
     How is my patient?

     KELLER
     She's fine.

     TODD
     Very well. Let's get started.

     KELLER

     (to Teyla)
     Don't worry. He's just here as a technical advisor. I'm going to be
     performing the surgery.
     (to staff)
     All right, we're ready.

   [The anesthesiologist injects a syringe into her line. Teyla glances
   towards the observation room and breathes deeply. The surgery
   continues. Todd giving advice as they work and study monitors.
   Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon watch worriedly. McKay has to turn away.
   Todd nods, as does Keller as they work on Teyla.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

   [Sheppard sits on a bench. McKay and Ronon pace.]

     MCKAY
     When are we going to get to see her?

     SHEPPARD
     Give it some time. Just relax.

     MCKAY
     I can't. I've had, like, three cups of coffee. I'm completely wired.

     RONON

     (deadpan)
     Really? I hadn't noticed.

   [The door opens, and Keller steps out. She is in her usual Atlantis
   uniform now.]

     KELLER
     All right. You can see her now.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [The trio follow Keller to Teyla's bed. They stare at her, all looking
   disturbed.]

     TEYLA
     How do I look?

   [Teyla speaks in a Wraith reverberating tone. Her face is mottled green
   with slits in the cheekbones. Her eyes are reptilian and yellow. Her
   hair is black. She looks like a Wraith.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Todd's hive ship floats in space.]

   INT--QUEEN'S THRONE ROOM

     TODD
     Now, assume your throne.

   [Teyla unsteadily moves to the throne. She sits in it carefully, as if
   it might bite, then shifts in it, trying to get comfortable.]

     TODD

     (angrily)
     Are you trying to get us both killed?!

     TEYLA

     (puzzled)
     I do not understand.

     TODD
     At the first sign of deception, the Primary will not hesitate to
     slit our throats!

     TEYLA

     (standing)
     You said she would sense my Wraith DNA.

     TODD

     (disgusted)
     It is not your "DNA" that concerns me. It is your manner. Your
     bearing. You project apprehension.

     TEYLA
     Well, given the circumstances...

     TODD
     It may be understandable, but it is not acceptable! Above all, you
     must never show weakness. Now...again!

   [Teyla juts out her chin in challenge.]

   INT--WRAITH CONFERENCE ROOM

   [The rest of Teyla's team waits in the room.]

     MCKAY
     How long is this going to take anyway?

     SHEPPARD
     Until Todd's satisfied she can pass as a Wraith queen. You know,
     personally, I'm not inclined to rush this thing.

     MCKAY
     She's already too convincing if you ask me. Creeps me out.

     SHEPPARD

     (squirming)
     She's still Teyla...underneath all that.

     RONON
     Maybe that's the problem.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I'm not any crazier about this than you guys. But the fact is,
     Todd's putting his life on the line, too. I don't think he'd go in
     there with her if he didn't think she could pull this off.

   [Todd enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where's Teyla?

     TODD
     Resting. You'll be pleased to know we've received word back from the
     Primary's hive. We've been instructed to meet with them at their
     current location.

     MCKAY
     So, what's the plan?

     TODD
     Once we arrive, we make contact with the ship and make our way over.
     Then Teyla will put forward my proposal.

     MCKAY
     Oh, your proposal?

     TODD
     Believe me, the less the Primary knows about my dealings with the
     humans of Atlantis, the better.

     SHEPPARD

     (cautiously)
     If she doesn't know it's coming from us, what are the chances she's
     going to buy it?

     TODD
     Our alliance has recently been dealt a number of setbacks.

     RONON

     (grinning)
     You're getting your asses kicked.

     TODD
     Indeed. Although the Primary would never admit it out loud. But the
     one thing stronger than her pride is her instinct for survival.

   [He steps closer to Ronon, intimidating.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Todd's ship drops out of hyperspace. The Primary's hive ship already
   waits there.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE

   [The second-in-command is at the bridge controls. Teyla stands, looking
   nervous. Todd walks over, studying her bearing.]

     TODD
     Don't be nervous.

     TEYLA

     (trying to sound haughty)
     I am not.

   [Todd studies Teyla for moment, then nods for the communication to be
   engaged. The Primary queen appears on the screen.]

     PRIMARY

     (on video)
     So...at long last we meet.

     TEYLA
     Indeed.

     PRIMARY
     Many among my crew were beginning to think you didn't exist.

     TEYLA
     You must point them out to me, so that I may remove all doubt from
     their minds.

     PRIMARY

     (chuckling)
     That will no longer be necessary. Make your way to my ship.
     (hissing)
     And do not keep me waiting again.

   [The video-link shuts down.]

     TODD
     She likes you.

     TEYLA

     (dubious)
     You think so?

     TODD
     It was as warm a reception as we could expect.

   INT--WRAITH BRIEFING ROOM

   [Teyla rejoins the rest of her team.]

     SHEPPARD
     How'd it go?

     TEYLA
     Apparently, quite well. They are preparing a shuttle to take me over
     to the other hive.

     SHEPPARD
     You know, we can pull the plug anytime you want. You just give us
     the word.

     TEYLA
     No. We've come this far. I intend to go through with this.

     MCKAY

     Well, we'll be right here. If anything goes wrong...
     (clicks his tongue)
     ...we'll get you out.

     SHEPPARD

     (reassuring)
     But nothing's going to.

     MCKAY
     Well, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does...

     SHEPPARD

     (warning)
     Rodney...

     MCKAY

     (meekly)
     Which it won't.

     RONON
     Hey...just be careful over there.

   [Teyla nods at Ronon. Looks at the others, then leaves.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A small Wraith ship flies from one hive to the other.]

   INT--PRIMARY HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [A bald Wraith and several soldier Wraith stand in the corridor. A door
   opens and Teyla and Todd enter. The bald Wraith bows low.]

     BALD WRAITH
     Welcome to my ship.

   [Teyla looks around warily.]

     TEYLA
     Where is your queen?

     BALD WRAITH

     You will meet her in time.
     (to soldiers)
     Inform the bridge they're onboard. Take us to hyperspace.

   [One of the soldiers walks away.]

     TODD
     This was not part of the agreement.

     BALD WRAITH
     You did not expect us to conduct this meeting here, within weapons
     range of your hive.

     TODD
     We are part of the same alliance...unless you do not trust us.

     BALD WRAITH
     I make it a practice to trust no one I do not know. It is how the
     queen wishes it. Follow me...please.

   [He leads the way. Todd bows to let Teyla walk first, then follows.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Primary's hive ship jumps into hyperspace.]

   INT--TODD'S SHIP BRIDGE

   [Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay walk into the bridge.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's going on?

     WRAITH SECOND
     The Primary's hive just went into hyperspace.

     MCKAY
     What?!

     SHEPPARD
     That wasn't part of the deal.

     WRAITH SECOND
     No, it was not.

     RONON
     Where'd they go?

     WRAITH SECOND
     I do not know. There is no way to track them.

     RONON

     (drawing his weapon)
     He's lying!

   [Wraith soldiers draw their own weapons and point them at Ronon, McKay,
   and Sheppard before the other two can draw arms. McKay looks around
   nervously, raising his hands unthreateningly.]

     MCKAY
     Uh, Ronon?

     WRAITH SECOND
     I assure you, I know nothing of this.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon...

   [Ronon glances around, then stands down.]

     WRAITH SECOND
     It appears we have no choice but to trust each other.

   INT--PRIMARY THRONE ROOM

   [The bald Wraith leads Teyla and Todd to the empty throne room.]

     BALD WRAITH
     The queen shall see you shortly.

   [He leaves them alone.]

     TEYLA
     What have you done?

     TODD

     (looking around nervously, speaking low)
     I swear, I did not expect this to happen. We're in no danger. If the
     queen did not believe us, we'd be dead already.

     TEYLA
     And if she begins to suspect? We are trapped on this ship.

     TODD
     Everything will be fine, provided you continue to play your part. We
     must proceed as planned.

   [A door opens, and the Primary steps inside.]

     PRIMARY

     (sharply)
     What is he doing here?

   [Todd bows low and steps back.]

     TEYLA
     I...thought his presence would be useful, as he is the one you have
     been dealing with up until now.

     PRIMARY

     (angry)
     I do not like surprises.

     TEYLA

     (sharply)
     Nor do I. And yet you are the one who took your ship to hyperspace
     the moment we stepped aboard.

     PRIMARY
     If you were in my position, you might understand the need for such
     precautions.

   [Teyla pauses for a few moments.]

     TEYLA
     Very well.

   [The Primary calms, sparing a sidelong glance at Todd, who averts his
   eyes in a supplicant gesture.]

     PRIMARY

     (to Teyla)
     Come. Let's sit.

   [She leads the way. Todd draws a knife from his shirt cuff and attacks
   the Primary from behind, slicing her in the jugular. The Primary grasps
   her throat and collapses, trying to breathe.]

     TEYLA

     (panicked)
     What are you doing?!

   [The Primary struggles, activating an alarm amulet that shrieks loudly
   before breathing her last.]

     TEYLA
     What is the meaning of this?!

   [Todd places the knife into Teyla's hand.]

     TODD
     Forgive me...but this is the way it must be. You must say that you
     killed her.

     TEYLA
     Are you insane?!

     TODD
     This is how it is done with our kind. This is how power changes
     hands.

     TEYLA
     But I do not want--

     TODD
     Listen to me! The crew will not be happy, but nor will they wish to
     be without a queen. You caught her off-guard. Many will perceive
     that to mean that she was growing weak. All you need to do is
     convince them that you are a capable replacement, and they will
     accept you.

     TEYLA
     And if I can't?

     TODD
     Then we're both dead.

   [The bald Wraith and several soldiers enter.]

     BALD WRAITH
     What is this?!

     TEYLA
     I have taken what is rightfully mine.

   [The wraith goes to the queen and deactivates the alarm.]

     BALD WRAITH

     (grieving)
     You killed her!

     TEYLA
     Yes, and you are the better for it.

     BALD WRAITH
     You will die for this!

   [He pulls his stunner.]

     TEYLA
     How dare you point a weapon at your queen!

     BALD WRAITH
     This was my queen!

     TEYLA
     Not anymore.

   [Todd steps in the line of fire.]

     TODD
     She was growing weak. She no longer had full control over the
     alliance. If you can't see that, you're a fool.

   [Teyla comes up behind Todd, strikes him, and kicks him behind the
   knees, wrapping her knife hand around his throat as he falls to his
   knees.]

     TEYLA
     Did I ask you to speak for me?!

     TODD
     No, my queen.

   [The bald wraith studies this exchange with interest.]

     TEYLA
     Wag your tongue like that again, and I will remove it. Is that
     understood?

     TODD
     Yes, my queen!

   [Teyla releases him and tosses the knife away imperiously.]

     TEYLA

     (to bald wraith)
     Now, drop us out of hyperspace and run a full diagnostic. I wish to
     know the state of my new flagship...And have this...thing removed
     from my sight.

   [They look to the Primary's corpse.]

     BALD WRAITH

     (hesitantly)
     Yes, my queen.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Primary hive drops out of hyperspace near a nebula.]

   INT--PRIMARY THRONE ROOM

   [Teyla paces the room alone. Todd enters.]

     TODD
     I have surveyed the crew. You'll be pleased to know they were
     entirely fooled!

     TEYLA
     What were you thinking?! You put both our lives at terrible risk!

     TODD
     I know. If you'll allow me to explain--

     TEYLA
     How could you do this?

     TODD
     It was necessary. The former queen was never going to accept your
     proposal.

     TEYLA
     And so you...killed her and forced me to take the blame.

     TODD
     If I had taken the blame, I would have been killed and you would've
     been held captive. That was not the desired outcome. You must
     understand, our culture is different from your own. We govern
     ourselves by different rules. It was important for you to claim
     ownership of the act of killing the queen.

     TEYLA

     (fiercely)
     You should have informed me of your intention to make me queen of
     this hive.

   [Todd bows mockingly.]

     TODD
     Perhaps, but I doubt you would have gone through with it had you
     known.

     TEYLA
     You're right. It was a foolish, reckless plan.

     TODD
     Most Wraith seek to be ruled. They fear being without a queen. I
     knew that if you presented yourself as a viable substitute, most of
     them would just...fall in line.

     TEYLA
     "Most of them?"

     TODD
     The point is that we have achieved what we set out to do. You are
     now effectively in control of the alliance. We may now implement
     Doctor Keller's plan without hindrance.

     TEYLA
     Then there is no further need for us to continue this charade. Take
     me back to your ship!

     TODD
     Soon, but first, you must allow some time for order to be
     restored--for things to return to normal. Once they do, you may take
     your leave. And no one on this crew will be the wiser.

   [Teyla stares at Todd wide eyed.]

   INT--TODD'S SHIP CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIDGE

     RONON
     I still say this was a setup.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know. Kenny seemed pretty surprised when that ship
     disappeared.

     MCKAY
     Who?

     SHEPPARD
     Kenny, the second in command.

     MCKAY
     Well, since when did we start calling him that?

     RONON

     (ignoring McKay)
     Maybe he wasn't in on it.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know, if Todd wanted to kidnap Teyla, he would've done it
     the second we arrived. It doesn't add up.

     MCKAY
     Seriously, the next time we have to name one of these guys, we
     should take a vote.

   [Ronon and Sheppard glance at McKay, then continue their conversation.]

     RONON
     So, what are we going to do?

   [Sheppard shrugs.]

     MCKAY
     We can't stay here, we're stuck on a hive, surrounded by Wraith. Not
     exactly our strongest position.

     SHEPPARD
     All I got is a jumper. Where do you want to go?

     MCKAY
     Well, we get to a 'gate, we gate back to Atlantis, and then
     we...figure out where they took Teyla.

     SHEPPARD
     How, exactly?

     MCKAY

     (weakly)
     Okay, so I haven't quite worked out the details yet. But, uh...

   [Todd's second in command, "Kenny", enters.]

     KENNY
     We have something.

   [He leads them to the bridge.]

   INT--TODD'S SHIP BRIDGE

     KENNY
     The Primary's hive has dropped out of hyperspace.

     SHEPPARD
     How do you know?

     KENNY
     We're receiving a signal.

   [He pulls up a star chart with a blinking signal in one section.]

     MCKAY
     It's Todd's subspace transmitter.

     KENNY
     They're in empty space on the edge of a large nebula.

     MCKAY
     Well, what are they doing out there?

     SHEPPARD
     Who cares? This is our chance. Let's go after them.

     KENNY
     I've already plotted the course. But you should know that it will
     arouse suspicion for us to arrive unannounced.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, let's worry about that later. For now, this is the closest
     thing they've got to a distress signal.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Todd's ship enters hyperspace.]

   INT--PRIMARY THRONE ROOM

   [The bald wraith enters the throne room, where Teyla sits on her
   throne, deep in a low conversation with Todd.]

     BALD WRAITH
     I'm sorry to disturb you, my queen. We've received an urgent report.

   [He holds out a Wraith tablet. Todd snatches it away.]

     TODD

     (challenging)
     You intend to make her read it?

     BALD WRAITH
     A hive belonging to another alliance has been detected above one of
     our feeding grounds not far from here.

     TODD
     Have you tried to contact them?

     BALD WRAITH
     They are not responding.

     TEYLA

     (dismissively)
     Dispatch the closest hive to investigate.

     BALD WRAITH
     We are the closest hive. It falls upon us to intercept.

     TEYLA

     (firmly)
     We must remain here.

   [The bald Wraith exchanges a puzzled look with Todd. Todd turns to
   Teyla and bows.]

     TODD

     (with warning look)
     My queen...perhaps we should discuss this in private.

   [Teyla sighs and rolls her eyes.]

     TEYLA
     Leave us.

   [The Bald Wraith bows and takes his leave.]

   INT--PRIMARY HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [The Bald Wraith pauses outside the door, seeming to consider these
   events.]

   INT--PRIMARY QUEEN THRONE ROOM

     TODD

     (speaking low)
     We must respond to this. To do otherwise will read as weakness. The
     crew will not understand.

     TEYLA

     (fiercely)
     Then let them be confused.

     TODD
     Spoken like a true queen. But you risk breeding suspicion. For the
     moment, they believe you and are prepared to serve you. But if you
     break that trust by making irrational decisions, they will...quickly
     fall away from you.

     TEYLA
     What about your ship? It is probably already on its way.

     TODD
     They will pick up on our new location as soon as they arrive.

   [Teyla sighs in defeat.]

     TEYLA
     Inform the bridge to set a course.

   INT--TODD'S SHIP CONFERENCE ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     Now, Kenny's right about one thing, the second we drop out of
     hyperspace, the Primary's hive ship's going to know something's up.

     RONON
     We drop out early. Go the rest of the way by jumper.

     SHEPPARD
     That's going to take too long. We need a diversion.

     MCKAY
     So what, uh...what kind of a diversion?

   [Ronon and Sheppard exchange looks.]

     RONON
     You thinking what I'm thinking?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. I don't think we can rely on Kenny to give the order, though.

     RONON
     We don't give him a choice.

     MCKAY
     What are you talking about? What-what order? Oh, no, wait a minute,
     wait a minute, you're-you're not thinking about attacking the other
     ship?

     SHEPPARD
     Look, it's the only way to keep them occupied long enough to get on
     board, get Teyla, and get back.

     MCKAY
     But it's also incredibly risky. Look, I mean, either of these ships
     could be destroyed!

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we'll just make sure we get her out of there before that
     happens.

   [McKay still looks skeptical. Sheppard looks at him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I realize the odds aren't exactly in our favor, Rodney,
     but...the longer we wait to get Teyla, the more likely it is we
     never will. We just have to...keep all of our options open.

   [McKay sighs.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Primary hive ship exits hyperspace and approaches another hive
   ship orbiting a planet.]

   INT--PRIMARY SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Todd walks with Teyla as they head to the bridge.]

     TODD
     We have reached the feeding ground. They will attempt to negotiate a
     concession. But you must stand firm. They may even threaten to
     attack. But they will not want to fight...any more than we do.

   INT--PRIMARY SHIP BRIDGE

   [They enter. The Bald Wraith meets them.]

     BALD WRAITH
     The other hive is trying to contact us.

     TEYLA
     Ignore them. Charge weapons.

   [Todd and the Bald Wraith stare at her, stunned.]

     BALD WRAITH
     You wish to attacked unprovoked?

     TEYLA
     We were provoked. They have encroached upon our territory. I want
     them destroyed...now!

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Primary ship fires on the other hive ship. It takes heavy damage.]

   INT--PRIMARY SHIP HIVE

   [Todd steps close to Teyla. Their backs are to the others.]

     TODD

     (sotto voce, to Teyla)
     What are you doing?

     TEYLA
     What does it look like?

     TODD
     I told you to talk to them.

     TEYLA
     You also told me to show no weakness.

   [The ship shudders.]

     BALD WRAITH
     They're returning fire. We're taking hull damage.

     TEYLA
     Deploy the darts.

     BALD WRAITH
     Under these conditions, they will suffer heavy losses.

     TEYLA

     (sharply)
     I'm fully aware of the costs. We must take a firm stance against
     intrusions such as this.

   [Todd's eyes widen in realization. He stares at Teyla in horror.]

     TODD

     (speaking low)
     You're doing this on purpose...to kill Wraith.

   EXT--SPACE

   [There is a fierce dogfight as the Wraith darts approach the rival hive
   ship.]

   INT--PRIMARY SHIP BRIDGE

     BALD WRAITH
     Half the first wave has been destroyed.

     TEYLA
     But the survivors are now too close to be affected by the ship's
     weapons, and they can attack at will.

     BALD WRAITH

     (slyly)
     Until the enemy launches their own darts to intercept.

     TEYLA
     That will take time! With any luck we have caught them off-guard.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Todd's hive ship drops out of hyperspace near the nebula.]

   INT--TODD'S SHIP BRIDGE

   [Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay are on the bridge with Kenny.]

     KENNY
     They're not here.

     SHEPPARD
     Where the hell are they?

     KENNY
     They've moved...to one of our more populated feeding grounds.

     RONON
     What for?

     KENNY

     (irritated)
     I do not know. I'm not on the ship. But if I had to guess, I would
     say they've gone to cull.

     RONON
     What now?

     MCKAY
     What else can we do? We go after them.

     SHEPPARD

     (to McKay)
     If they jump into hyperspace, we're going to lose them again, right?

     MCKAY
     Pretty much. Todd's locator beacon doesn't work in hyperspace.

     SHEPPARD

     We've gotta stop playing catch up.
     (to Kenny)
     Is there a Stargate on that planet?

     KENNY
     Of course.

     SHEPPARD
     Then drop us off. We can get there faster in the jumper.

     KENNY
     How do you intend to get on board their ship?

     SHEPPARD
     Don't worry about it. Just get us to the nearest Stargate.

   [Kenny looks unhappy, but complies.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The rival hive launches its own fighters, and the battle becomes even
   more heated.]

   INT--PRIMARY HIVE SHIP BRIDGE

     BALD WRAITH
     My queen, our darts are outnumbered two to one. If we do not recall
     them now, they will be wiped out!

     TEYLA
     And their sacrifice will be remembered when this alliance rules the
     galaxy.

   [There is a heavy flash and low rumbling.]

     TODD
     What was that?

     WRAITH TECHNICIAN
     We just lost the medial weapons array.

     TEYLA

     (steeling herself)
     Keep firing all other batteries!

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The jumper flies through the active Stargate. It cloaks and flies into
   orbit.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     All right, we should be coming up on them...now. Wait a
     minute...there's two of them.

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     MCKAY

     (puzzled)
     And they're fighting! They're not pulling any punches either.

     SHEPPARD
     You still picking up that signal?

     MCKAY
     Uh...yeah.

   [McKay pulls up the HUD and shows the beacon emitting from one of the
   hive ships above the planet.]

     MCKAY
     All right, it's that one. They're not doing so good.

     SHEPPARD
     What do you mean?

     MCKAY
     They must've lost some of their weapons. I mean, they're seriously
     outgunned.

     RONON
     We gotta do something.

     MCKAY
     You know, just last week I was talking to Zelenka about trying to
     reverse-engineer a Daedalus beaming system for the jumpers?

     SHEPPARD
     And?

     MCKAY
     Oh, well, no, we're nowhere near close. I mean, the Asgard
     technology's incredibly complicated--

     SHEPPARD
     Well, what the hell are you bringing this up for now?

     MCKAY
     I'm just saying that this would be the perfect situation
     for...something like this.

     SHEPPARD

     (groaning)
     All right, everybody hold on. We're going in.

   [He shuts off the HUD and flies faster.]

     MCKAY
     What are you doing?

     SHEPPARD
     Trying to tip the scales a little.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper approaches one of the hive ships and de-cloaks.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Are you nuts?! They can see us!

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper fires drones throughout the underbelly of the hive. The
   ship has several small explosions as the jumper re-cloaks and flies
   away.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     RONON
     Think that did it?

     SHEPPARD
     We're about to find out.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The rival hive ship disintegrates in a large explosion.]

   INT--PRIMARY HIVE BRIDGE

     BALD WRAITH
     That's impossible. The enemy hive just exploded.

     TODD

     (bowing low)
     Well done, my queen.

     TEYLA

     (to bald wraith)
     Perhaps next time you will not be so quick to question my tactics.

   [She stalks away. Todd gives a look to the bald wraith, then follows.]

     BALD WRAITH

     (cautiously, to technician)
     Recall the darts.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Darts are heading back. Bay doors are open.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, that's our cue. I'm going in.

   INT--PRIMARY HIVE CORRIDOR

   [Ronon, McKay, and Sheppard crouch in a side corridor as a Wraith
   soldier patrol passes in the main one. McKay studies his scanner.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where do we go?

     MCKAY
     I don't know.

     SHEPPARD
     What do you mean, "you don't know?"

     MCKAY
     It's hard to tell. I think we're on the wrong level...plus, the
     signal keeps moving around.

     SHEPPARD
     That's a good sign Todd's alive.

     RONON
     Still doesn't tell us anything about Teyla.

     MCKAY
     All right. It's this way...I think.

   [They head out and down another corridor. They stop, hiding behind a
   pillar as they spot two soldiers guarding an entryway.]

     RONON

     (whispering)
     Whoa.

     SHEPPARD

     (whispering)
     We're going to have to circle back.

     MCKAY

     (whispering)
     Oh, great. I gotta figure this out all over again?

   [Ronon checks the other direction, but sees soldiers approaching their
   position. He hides.]

     RONON
     Another patrol coming this way.

     MCKAY
     So what are we gonna do?

     SHEPPARD
     We got no choice.

     MCKAY
     Oh...

   [He whimpers as they open fire on the Wraith. They shoot all of the
   Wraith nearby.]

     SHEPPARD
     Let's move.

     RONON
     Which way?

   [Sheppard checks his direction; there are Wraith coming.]

     SHEPPARD
     I guess that answers that.

   [They run in Ronon's direction. They meet several Wraith coming out of
   a transporter and open fire. Ronon and McKay are stunned by Wraith
   coming out another corridor. Sheppard returns fire, but he too is
   felled. The Bald Wraith arrives.]

     BALD WRAITH
     Inform the queen. We have intruders.

   INT--PRIMARY PRISON CELL

     MCKAY
     Now what?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, if I had to guess, I'd say we'll be taken in front of the
     queen, who will demand answers and threaten to feed on us, by which
     time I hope to have a plan to get us out of here.

     MCKAY

     (flatly)
     Very reassuring.

   [A door opens and Teyla approaches.]

     MCKAY
     It's Teyla. She's alive.

     SHEPPARD

     (low, warning)
     Rodney...quiet.

     TEYLA

     (haughtily, to guards)
     Leave us.

   [The guards leave.]

     TEYLA

     (sounding more like herself, but still with Wraith voice)
     John, Ronon, Rodney, it is good to see you. But you should not have
     come for me.

     SHEPPARD
     Why? What's going on?

     TEYLA
     I will explain later. But you must not attempt to escape. You are in
     no danger. I'm now queen of this hive.

     MCKAY
     Wait...what?!

     TEYLA
     It is a long story.

     SHEPPARD
     No, we got a jumper here, we can leave right now!

     TEYLA
     No! I must solidify my position first. It is the only chance we have
     to ensure the alliance will accept the treatment. Otherwise, this
     will all have been for nothing.

   [They consider this.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. We'll let it play out...for now.

   [Teyla sighs in relief, nods, and leaves. No one notices the bald
   wraith hidden behind the corner, who has watched the entire exchange.]

   INT--PRIMARY THRONE ROOM

   [Teyla exits a transporter and approaches her throne. The Bald Wraith
   appears out of the shadows.]

     BALD WRAITH
     My queen...

     TEYLA

     (startled)
     What are you doing here? Who authorized you to wait in my quarters?

     BALD WRAITH

     (smiling)
     I let myself in. I needed to see you in private.

     TEYLA

     (rattled)
     I do not wish to speak right now. Come back later.

     BALD WRAITH
     I'm afraid I can't do that.

     TEYLA
     I am your queen, I command you--

     BALD WRAITH
     You are not my queen!

     TEYLA
     How dare you speak to me like this! Remove yourself from my sight
     immediately!

     BALD WRAITH
     I saw you talking with the prisoners from Atlantis.

     TEYLA
     And? I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?

     BALD WRAITH
     Oh, you may--though it is odd that you refer to them as prisoners. I
     overheard what you said to them. You knew them, and they know you.
     And I asked myself: "how is such a thing possible?" I suspected you
     right from the moment you set foot aboard my ship.

   [Teyla has been looking more and more fearful. She tries to bolt, but
   the Wraith blocks her path.]

     BALD WRAITH

     And against my better judgment, I allowed you to remain on board...
     (draws his sword)
     ...while you committed treachery after treachery! It was my duty to
     defend this ship, and I failed.

   [He swings his sword, but Teyla ducks, stabbing him in the side with
   her dagger. The Wraith backhands her with a powerful swing, knocking
   her off her feet and into the throne, where she knocks her head against
   the back of it. She is still stunned while the Wraith pulls out the
   dagger and drags her off the throne, throwing her onto the floor. He
   crouches behind her and holds the sword blade to her throat.]

     BALD WRAITH
     I'm afraid your reign is over...my queen!

   [He is struck several times in the back by the Wraith stunner weapon
   wielded by Todd. Teyla scrambles away as Todd approaches. He bends down
   and breaks the Bald Wraith's neck, then stands.]

     TODD
     He'll not be bothering you any further.

     TEYLA

     (breathlessly)
     Thank you.

   [Todd grins and nods.]

   INT--PRIMARY SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Todd and Teyla walk down a corridor.]

     TODD
     My hive arrived moments ago. I've arranged for Colonel Sheppard,
     Ronon, and Doctor McKay to be transferred there immediately.

     TEYLA
     Good. When do I join them?

     TODD
     As soon as this is all over.

   INT--PRIMARY THRONE ROOM

   [Teyla sits on the throne, speaking imperiously to several columns of
   Wraith gathered there.]

     TEYLA

     ...and thus I will be taking my leave of you and returning to my
     former hive. I am leaving behind my trusted commander.
     (gesturing to Todd)
     Let me be clear, you will still fall under my protection, but in my
     absence, you will heed his every order as if it were my own. When he
     speaks, it is as though I am speaking through him. Is that
     understood?

     WRAITH TECHNICIAN
     Yes, my queen.

     TEYLA

     Good. Then it is time.
     (to Todd)
     Escort me to my transport.

   [Todd bows.]

     WRAITH TECHNICIAN
     The queen departs.

   [The Wraith position themselves as an honor guard, making way for
   Teyla, who stalks out, Todd following.]

   INT--PRIMARY HIVE CORRIDOR

     TODD
     Well done. I believe you've managed to allay all suspicions.

     TEYLA
     Just remember why we did this--to disseminate Doctor Keller's
     treatment to as many Wraith as possible.

     TODD
     Of course. Although I think it might be wise to let matters settle
     for a time first.

   [Teyla stops and turns to him.]

     TEYLA

     (suspiciously)
     How much time?

     TODD
     Not long.

     TEYLA
     You're not planning on going back on our agreement, are you?

     TODD
     No, no. I'm just saying that to press such a radical agenda so soon
     after the change in leadership...well, it may invite unwelcome
     questions.

     TEYLA
     Fine.

     TODD
     Very well--

     TEYLA
     But bear in mind that as far as this crew is concerned, I am still
     their queen.

     TODD
     Oh, yes.

     TEYLA
     I will be watching you. And should you step out of line, I will not
     hesitate to make a reappearance...and have you removed.

     TODD
     Very well.

     TEYLA
     Permanently.

   [Todd curls his hands into fists impotently as he watches Teyla leave.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Sheppard and Keller approach Teyla's bedside. Sheppard looks
   concerned.]

     SHEPPARD
     What have you done to her, Doc?

   [Teyla rolls her eyes. She looks like herself again.]

     TEYLA
     Very funny.

     KELLER
     How are you feeling?

     TEYLA
     Better. Still some soreness, but for the most part, it's gone.

     KELLER
     Good. Well, I have rounds, but I'll come and check on you later.
     Make sure he doesn't give you a hard time.

   [Teyla chuckles while Sheppard tries to look innocent as Keller
   leaves.]

     SHEPPARD
     Sure you're feeling okay?

     TEYLA
     Yes. Thank you.

     SHEPPARD
     No lingering desires to feed on anything?

     TEYLA
     Only on solid food. The blended concoctions given to me by Doctor
     Keller are not very satisfying.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, it's only been two weeks. Give it some time. Look, um...I
     haven't had the chance to tell you that what you did, uh, took...you
     know, a lot of guts.

     TEYLA

     I'm just glad it worked out for the best.
     (takes a deep breath)
     Has there been any further word from Todd?

     SHEPPARD
     Not really. We're supposed to meet with him in a few weeks about
     this whole gene therapy thing. Word has it, he's, uh, solidified his
     position as a "leader" of the alliance.

   [He makes air quotes on saying "leader." Teyla looks away, deep in
   thought.]

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     TEYLA
     Do you not find it strange that as a result of all of this, Todd now
     personally has control of that entire alliance?

     SHEPPARD
     You think that was his plan all along, huh?

     TEYLA
     The thought had crossed my mind.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Regardless, I think we're better off than we were before.

     TEYLA
     Yes. I suppose you're right.

   [She doesn't look confident.]

     SHEPPARD
     Get some rest. I'll come back and check on you.

     TEYLA
     Hmm.

   [Sheppard leaves. Teyla studies what had been her feeding hand and
   looks deep in thought.]

   FADE OUT
