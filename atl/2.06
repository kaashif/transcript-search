   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [The Puddle Jumper comes through a space 'gate above the planet.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard's team is aboard.]

     MCKAY
     I'm just saying, as a team veteran, to the new guy--heavy lunch
     before mission departure, bad idea. I mean, even with the inertial
     dampeners, this whole flying thing is best done on an empty stomach.

     RONON
     Yeah, well, I've got a pretty strong stomach.

     MCKAY
     Hey, I can eat frozen dinners without thawing them, and sometimes it
     even affects me.

     SHEPPARD

     (annoyed)
     McKay, are you reading anything?

     MCKAY
     Oh. Nothing. Life signs from the planet are negative.

     TEYLA
     Then it is a shame. From what we read in the Atlantis database, the
     Dorandans were a wonderful race of people.

     MCKAY
     Well, the database is over ten thousand years old. You can bet
     things have changed around here.

     RONON

     (seeing something)
     Sheppard.

   [There is a large debris field ahead of the Jumper.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. That's not something you see every day.

     TEYLA
     There was a great battle here.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [They pass by larger pieces of debris.]

     TEYLA

     (voiceover)
     That is a hive ship.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     RONON
     That was a hive ship.

     SHEPPARD
     Something put a lot of holes in it all right. We should check it
     out.

     MCKAY
     Whoa, whoa, whoa. What if whatever put holes in it wants to put
     holes in us?

     SHEPPARD
     Like you said, a lot's changed in ten thousand years.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [The Jumper descends through the debris to the planet.]

   EXT--DORANDA, DAY

   [The Jumper skims a ruined city. Thunder and lightening strike it.]

     MCKAY
     That would explain the lack of life signs.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     RONON
     This is what usually happens when you fight back.

     SHEPPARD
     These folks took out a fleet of Wraith ships. I'd say they did a
     pretty good job fighting back.

     MCKAY

     Hold on. I'm picking up faint energy readings, coming from
     (pointing)
     there. Well, that explains how they would be able to put up such a
     good fight.

     SHEPPARD
     How?

     MCKAY
     Because...they were Ancients.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The Jumper maneuvers to a large building that remains.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--DORANDA, DAY

   [A large building remains. It appears to have a large weapon on the
   roof.]

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

   [The team descends a ladder into the dark facility. They look around
   with flashlights.]

     MCKAY
     Definitely Ancient design. Their latest stuff, too. Their latest
     being ten thousand years old.

     SHEPPARD
     It looks a lot like the labs we've found on Atlantis.

     RONON
     So this was one of their outposts?

     TEYLA
     Yet the ancestors made no mention of their presence here in their
     database. Why?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, let's find out. Can you power it up?

     MCKAY
     Working on it.

   [McKay works on an Ancient tablet while the others search around.]

     SHEPPARD
     I've got two bodies here.

     RONON
     I've got three more over here. Whatever happened here, no one came
     back to claim the dead.

     SHEPPARD
     Can't tell if they were fed on by the Wraith.

     RONON
     Yeah, something killed them.

     TEYLA
     Something killed everyone on this world.

     SHEPPARD
     Then why is this outpost, if that's what it is, still intact? It
     doesn't make sense. What do you think, Rodney?

   [The power comes on, and the lights.]

     MCKAY
     Hah. Sorry, I wasn't listening, but it just struck me that this is
     an Ancient outpost. Why would the Wraith leave it intact?

   [The others exchange glances.]

     SHEPPARD
     That's a good question.

     MCKAY

     (examining tablet)
     Huh. All right. So...

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard and his team walk through with Weir.]

     WEIR
     So it's a military research facility?

     SHEPPARD
     From what we can tell, it's a ground-based version of the satellite
     weapon we used to destroy that hive ship.

     MCKAY
     With one major exception--firepower. I mean, if that single outpost
     is responsible for destroying an entire Wraith fleet--

     WEIR
     And you're sure it was this weapon than destroyed all those Wraith
     ships?

     SHEPPARD
     It had to be. There's nothing on the planet that suggests the
     Dorandans had anything capable of inflicting anywhere near that much
     damage.

     TEYLA
     If we could learn of such technology, we could defend other worlds
     from being culled.

     RONON
     It didn't save the Dorandans.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but at the end of the day, the outpost was still standing, and
     that means, uh... Well, I'm not sure what that means, but it means
     something definitely worth finding out.

     WEIR
     Colonel?

     SHEPPARD
     He's right. It's definitely worth sending a research team back.

     MCKAY
     Good! Well, give me Optican and Collins, and Zelenka, if he's over
     the stomach flu. We'll try to access the computer's logbooks, see if
     we can decipher them--

     WEIR
     Okay. Okay. Easy sell. Go.

     MCKAY
     Oh. Good.

   [McKay rushes out. The others exchange looks at his enthusiasm.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Teyla and Ronon meet up.]

     RONON
     Teyla. Um...I heard you were heading off-world on a personal
     mission.

     TEYLA
     To Belkan, yes.

     RONON
     Sounds interesting.

   [She smiles at him, and he returns the smile.]

     TEYLA
     The Belkans possess a particular disease-resistant strain of flax
     seed, which would double the yield of our crops on the mainland. In
     exchange, I intend to offer Athosian manpower to aid in their
     harvest. Still interested?

     RONON
     Uh, this place...has everything I could want, don't get me wrong,
     but, uh--

     TEYLA
     Sometimes you feel the need to go somewhere else.

     RONON
     Anywhere else.

     TEYLA
     I know the feeling.

     RONON
     So?

     TEYLA
     Bring only weapons you can conceal.

     RONON
     I'll keep it to a bare minimum.

   EXT--DORANDA, DAY

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

   [Many scientists are at work. Sheppard arrives and goes to look through
   an observation window into a large chamber, lit from above.]

     ZELENKA
     I'm telling you, at least point-oh-nine percent.

     MCKAY
     Oh, please. Please, move the decimal place. I mean, it's impossible,
     for God's sake.

     SHEPPARD
     Have we figured out what this is?

     MCKAY
     No.

     ZELENKA
     I wouldn't say no. No, we have a theory.

     MCKAY
     But we don't know yet.

     ZELENKA
     No, but based on the shielding around the chamber, what else could
     it be?

     SHEPPARD
     Have you tried turning it on?

     MCKAY
     That's what we're working on.

     MCKAY
     The problem is that there's no direct link between it and the main
     power control systems, which, among other things led us to theorize
     it's an ancillary power supply for the weapon systems.

     SHEPPARD
     Cool.

     MCKAY
     See that? See? See the way he lights up at the mention of that? It's
     like Dr. Vogel at the mention of pastry.

     SHEPPARD
     They found out a way to soup up their space guns?

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but it's much more than that.

     MCKAY
     The sticking point is that there's no tie between the power
     generator and the primary capacitor.

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, meaning they would have to channel the power directly into the
     weapon.

     MCKAY
     Which, I'm sure, means nothing to you.

     SHEPPARD
     It means they could fire multiple bursts without having to store up
     more power for the next firing sequence.

   [McKay is reluctantly impressed.]

     MCKAY
     Yes. Very good.

     SHEPPARD
     Which leads me back to "cool."

     MCKAY
     Mm.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but it only makes sense if we're right.

     SHEPPARD
     About what?

     ZELENKA
     Tell him.

     MCKAY
     Not yet.

     ZELENKA
     Come on, McKay. You read the equations. What else could it be? An
     Ancient typo?

     MCKAY
     Well, we know they're not perfect, because they're all dead.

     MCKAY
     Look, I just... I don't want you to get all excited over nothing.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, maybe you're right.

     MCKAY
     All right, I'll give you a hint. It seems the Ancients were
     experimenting with high-energy physics on a level that we've never
     seen before.

     SHEPPARD

     (underwhelmed)
     Wow.

     MCKAY
     Yes, "wow." I just...I want to be sure.

     SHEPPARD

     (humoring them)
     I'll do my best to wait.

   [He leaves.]

   INT--CONFERENCE ROOM ON BELKAN

   [Teyla and Ronon negotiate with the Belkans.]

     TEYLA
     The manpower that you are demanding is outrageous. You would turn my
     people into nothing more than indentured slaves to serve your farms.

     HENDON
     It would seem that you have nothing else of value to trade but your
     people.

   [A man enters with a tray of drinks.]

     TEYLA
     Mattas... You know full well my offer is fair.

     MATTAS
     I'm sorry, Teyla. If you had something of more value to offer...
     Technology, weapons...

     TEYLA
     You've heard my terms.

     HENDON
     Hmm. Then our business is done here.

   [Ronon angrily stabs the wooden table with a knife.]

     RONON
     She said her offer is fair.

   [They stand and face each other across the table.]

     HENDON
     I say it isn't.

     RONON
     Well, I say it is.

   EXT--BELKAN VILLAGE, DAY

   [Ronon and Teyla exit the building into the primitive village. They are
   carrying bags of seeds. Teyla drops hers and turns to face Ronon.]

     RONON
     What?

     TEYLA
     I had the situation under control.

     RONON
     It didn't look like it.

     TEYLA
     So you came to my rescue? You have no idea what is at stake during
     these negotiations. My people depend on me.

     RONON
     They were taking advantage of you.

     TEYLA
     No, they were not, but that is what I wanted them to think. A
     negotiation is a delicate process. The words spoken are often
     meaningless.

   [Mattas sees them from a nearby staircase.]

     MATTAS
     Teyla!

   [Mattas goes inside to come around to mee them.]

     RONON
     Do you want me to--

     TEYLA
     No.

     TEYLA
     Go. Gather our things. I will meet you at the gate.

     MATTAS
     It was a mistake to force Hendon's hand. You'll only pay for it next
     time.

     TEYLA
     I know.

     MATTAS
     Your friend is not Athosian?

     TEYLA
     No. Ronon is the only survivor of a world named Sateda. He saved the
     life of a friend of mine. In return, we offered him sanctuary.

     MATTAS
     If Sateda is his home-world, then he is not the only survivor. There
     is a man in this village who also claims to be from there.

   [Teyla is shocked.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The 'gate is active.]

     WEIR
     What have we got, Sergeant?

     TECHNICIAN
     It's Colonel Sheppard, Ma'am.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     This is Weir. Go ahead, Colonel.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [The Puddle Jumper flies back through the debris field toward the
   orbital Stargate.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     We're on our way back. Rodney wants to fill you in.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     I take it you've found something interesting.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Interesting? How about the greatest discovery of all time?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     He's pretty excited.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     So I hear. He couldn't even wait until he got back.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     I wanted to send an encoded data-burst directly from the outpost to
     the secure network in my lab while the gate was active. Now.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     TECHNICIAN
     Receiving transmission. Transferring data.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Care to fill me in so I can be excited too?

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     It's a weapon--

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     It is much, much more than a weapon. We think we've stumbled across
     the Ancients' last great discovery. It was too late to win the war
     for them, but if I can finish the work they started--

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     What is it?

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     It is the ultimate power source. Something that would make
     zero-point modules seem like alkaline batteries in comparison.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

   [Col. Caldwell has arrived.]

     MCKAY
     It was called Project Arcturus, and from what we can tell, its
     ultimate goal was to render ZPMs obsolete.

     WEIR
     How?

   [He uses the large displays to illustrate.]

     MCKAY
     A zero-point module is an artificially created region of
     subspace-time. It's kind of like a miniature universe in a bottle.

     ZELENKA
     It extracts vacuum energy from this artificial region of
     subspace-time until it reaches maximum entropy.

     CALDWELL
     So what's different about this thing?

     ZELENKA
     Project Arcturus was attempting to extract vacuum energy from our
     own space-time, making it potentially as powerful as the scope of
     the universe itself.

     CALDWELL
     This strikes me as something the Ancients would've tried first, even
     before ZPMs.

     MCKAY
     And they may have, but extracting zero-point energy from our own
     universe is...well, it's definitely trickier.

     WEIR
     Explain "trickier."

     ZELENKA
     Well, because we actually have to live in our own universe, it
     presents a whole range of problems.

     CALDWELL
     Well, obviously it's not that easy, or Atlantis wouldn't still rely
     on ZPMs.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you're right. The Ancients couldn't make it work.

     MCKAY
     I said I wanted to do all the talking.

     SHEPPARD
     Come on, Rodney. Arcturus was a total failure.

     MCKAY
     Failure, yes. Total, no. Look, the Ancients were losing the war
     against the Wraith when work on Arcturus began. If they could have
     made it work it could have turned the tide of war. I mean, we're
     talking about their own Manhattan Project.

     SHEPPARD
     The outpost was ordered by the Ancients in Atlantis to defend the
     Dorandan people using their weapons powered by this new power
     source.

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, yes, but despite their strong reservations that it was not
     ready to be tested under battle conditions.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, the point is, the Wraith won.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but the Dorandans still inflicted massive damage on the
     attacking Wraith fleet.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not saying they didn't put up a hell of a fight.

     ZELENKA
     The logs indicate there was a major malfunction.

     MCKAY
     Well yes, the Ancients in the bunker were forced to shut everything
     down, including the weapon.

     SHEPPARD
     The Wraith sent more ships, the Dorandans got wiped out.

     CALDWELL
     So if the malfunction hadn't occurred, the Ancients would've saved
     the planet?

     MCKAY
     Definitely.

     SHEPPARD
     Possibly. Don't sugarcoat this Rodney.

     MCKAY
     The Ancient scientists running Arcturus were rushed into testing
     before they had perfected a means of effectively controlling the
     power output. I believe if they'd had more time, history would've
     played out differently on that planet. Possibly in this galaxy.

     CALDWELL
     I won't deny that this is something that we'd dearly love to get our
     hands on, but the Ancients were a pretty bright bunch.

     MCKAY
     And desperate and losing a war they'd already been fighting for a
     hundred years. More importantly, they were--they were, like, this
     close.

     WEIR
     And you believe you can finish their work?

     MCKAY
     I do.

     ZELENKA
     We do.

     SHEPPARD
     They do.

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [McKay issues instructions to his staff in a montage.]

     MCKAY
     All right, I need everyone's attention, please. What we've got
     here...

     MCKAY
     I need this code divided into sections and each one
     double-checked...

     MCKAY
     No, you're not listening to me!

     ZELENKA
     It's not going to--

     MCKAY
     I'm telling you this one right here is wrong.

     MCKAY
     The whole point here is that these numbers here need to be
     corrected.

     MCKAY
     Unless they're corrected--there you go. Simulation failed.

   [They keep running simulations that all file.]

   EXT--DORANDA, NIGHT

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

   [Sheppard takes a heavy case from a scientist on the ladder.]

     MCKAY
     That's heavy. So, I need that over there. Thank you.

   [In a tube-like passageway, Zelenka and another scientist work. McKay
   speaks to Zelenka over the radio.]

     MCKAY
     I want you to pull the crystal. Pull it when I say go, all right?

   [Zelenka pulls the crystal, and the power shuts down. Later, McKay is
   in the command access tube and Zelenka is in the Ancient lab.]

     ZELENKA
     I think we have it.

   [McKay puts the crystal in, and the command access tube lights up. In
   the lab, Zelenka smiles.]

     ZELENKA
     That's it!

   INT--BELKAN VILLAGE PUB

   [Teyla and Ronon walk to the bar.]

     TEYLA
     We are looking for a man named Solen. Do you know him?

     BARTENDER
     Upstairs.

     TEYLA
     Thank you.

   [They walk up the stairs to where a group is gathered at a table,
   listening to a man telling a story.]

     SOLEN
     Was I afraid? Of course I was, but my people were counting on me.
     Now, I was alone, and I was low on ammo, but I managed to take out
     the three Wraith guards and gain access to the ship.

     RONON
     Liar.

     SOLEN

     (angrily standing up)
     What did you say?

     SOLEN
     Ronon?

     RONON

     (smiling)
     There were two Wraith guarding that cruiser, and he wasn't alone.

   [They embrace.]

     RONON
     Uh, Teyla Emmagan, Solen Sincha. We served in the same regiment on
     Sateda.

     TEYLA
     I am honored.

     SOLEN
     You two make a nice match. Congratulations.

     TEYLA
     We are friends, nothing more.

     RONON
     For years, I believed I was the only survivor.

     SOLEN
     So you don't know about the others?

     RONON
     What others?

     SOLEN
     Before the city fell, a few of us managed to make it to the shelters
     west of the capital. Over three hundred civilians found their way
     there, too. When we emerged, we realized there was nothing to
     salvage, so we left. All of us.

   [As he speaks, Ronon becomes quiet, as if stunned.]

     TEYLA
     To where?

     SOLEN
     Some came here, some went to Manaria.

     RONON

     (smiling)
     Three hundred.

     SOLEN
     Drink, Ronon, and rejoice--you're not alone!

   [They hug again.]

     SOLEN
     Yeah!

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

     MCKAY
     Everything's been triple-checked. Power levels are holding steady in
     all computer simulations.

     SHEPPARD
     Fire it up.

     MCKAY
     All right. Attention, all personnel. Stand by for power-up on my
     mark. Three, two, one... Mark.

   [The power source in the chamber powers up.]

   INT--BELKAN VILLAGE PUB

   [Ronon and Solen are laughing and drinking, clearly intoxicated.]

     SOLEN
     Oh, man. To see Kell's face when he sees you... Yeah, it's true.

     RONON
     Kell's alive?

     SOLEN
     And his family. They settled on Belsa. Run this big trading
     operation over there.

     RONON

     (sobering)
     When were you going to tell me this?

     SOLEN
     Honestly? I was going to wait until you drank a little more.

     RONON

     (smiling)
     Then you've seen him?

     SOLEN
     Yeah, he comes around now and then to trade weapons with the
     Belkans. He's got his own private army now.

     TEYLA
     Is this Kell a friend?

     SOLEN
     Oh, he's more like kin. He was Ronon's Task Master during his
     military training. There is no closer bond.

     RONON

     (smiling but perhaps uneasily)
     None.

     SOLEN
     To reunions.

   [They clang their tankards together.]

     RONON
     To reunions.

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

   [McKay and Zelenka are in the main lab.]

     MCKAY
     Radek, talk to me.

     ZELENKA
     I'm picking up some minor power fluctuations. Chamber temperature's
     holding steady. There it goes again.

   [Sheppard is watching the power source through the observation window.]

     SHEPPARD
     Is everything okay?

     MCKAY
     Everything's fine. The containment bottle was designed to
     automatically compensate for any sudden changes in energy output.

     ZELENKA
     This never happened in the simulations.

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe we should abort.

     MCKAY
     I said it's fine. Collins. See if you can boost more power to the
     field manually.

     COLLINS
     You got it.

   [Collins leaves. McKay makes more entries at his console, Sheppard
   looking on with worry.]

     MCKAY
     Okay.

   [Collins enters the command access tube where the crystal controls are.
   He removes a panel. He's wearing protective glasses as the light is
   very bright.]

     MCKAY
     Prepare for test firing, on my mark.

   [In the command access tube, a power wave bursts through the far wall
   and envelops Collins. He falls to the floor, screaming and writhing.]

     ZELENKA
     Levels just spiked into the red!

     MCKAY
     What?

     SHEPPARD
     Shut it down! Shut it all down!

     MCKAY
     I'm trying.

     ZELENKA
     The interface is not responding.

     MCKAY
     All right, I've already switched to back-ups.

     ZELENKA
     The levels are going off the scale!

     SHEPPARD
     McKay!

     MCKAY
     I have given the command to shut down. Something's creating an
     overload.

     SHEPPARD
     Then we should evacuate.

     MCKAY
     Just give me a few seconds.

     SHEPPARD
     We may not have that time.

   [The power sounds start to diminish, and Zelenka's displays show the
   energy flow returning to green levels.]

     ZELENKA
     Wait. Wait. Wait. It's stabilizing. The generator is offline.

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell just happened?

     MCKAY
     Obviously there was a surge of some kind... Look, Collin...Collins!

   [They rush to the command access tube door.]

     MCKAY
     Collins!

   [They open the door to see Collins has died, his hands covered with red
   burns.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Beckett hands out reports.]

     BECKETT
     Officially, my report will indicate Dr. Collins died due to
     radiation exposure, causing severe burns to well over ninety percent
     of his body.

     WEIR
     But it was more than that?

     BECKETT
     Aye, much more. To be honest, I have no idea what sort of radiation
     it was. I've never seen or heard of cellular decay this massive, not
     when exposure only lasted mere seconds.

     SHEPPARD
     Collins' next of kin have been notified.

     WEIR
     Good. What went wrong?

     ZELENKA

     (using a display to illustrate)
     We're still analyzing data from the test. All we know for certain
     was there was a massive power surge, which in turn caused the
     containment field to expand asymmetrically in the direction of the
     command access tube. As to why...

     CALDWELL
     How about human error?

     MCKAY
     Excuse me?

     CALDWELL
     Well, according to your report, during the tests, Dr. Collins made
     an adjustment to the containment field. Isn't it possible that he
     triggered the surge himself?

     WEIR
     Are you looking for a scapegoat, Colonel?

     CALDWELL
     Not at all, Doctor. I'm admittedly looking for a rationale that
     would allow Dr. McKay to continue his very important work. Is there
     something wrong with that?

     MCKAY
     No. Collins knew the system just as well as any of us. He wouldn't
     have made that kind of mistake. Everything was going well, and
     everyone did their job.

     WEIR
     Then what?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. In terms of physics, it shouldn't have happened.

     ZELENKA
     We're still analyzing the data from the accident. It's going to take
     time--

     MCKAY
     What I do know is the device did what it was supposed to do.

     SHEPPARD
     No, Rodney, it didn't.

     MCKAY
     Well, apart from the obvious containment issues--

     SHEPPARD
     It overloaded, and you couldn't stop it.

     MCKAY
     But we won't know for sure until we go back down there and try
     again.

     SHEPPARD
     Try again? Are you serious?

     MCKAY
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD

     (incredulous)
     A member of your team is in the morgue.

     MCKAY
     And I am responsible for his death. Yes, I am painfully aware of
     that. I sent him in there, and I will have to live with that for the
     rest of my life.

   [Sheppard nods slightly in understanding.]

     MCKAY
     But we have a responsibility to understand what happened and learn
     from it.

     ZELENKA
     Rodney, we don't even know what went wrong.

     MCKAY
     Which is why we have to go back there.

     WEIR
     I know how important this is to you, Rodney, but we knew when we
     came to Atlantis that we might encounter certain technologies which,
     for the moment, are out of our reach.

     MCKAY
     It's not, in this case.

     WEIR
     You have the data from your first attempt. You can run all the
     simulations you want.

     MCKAY
     Come on, Elizabeth, you really think the military's going to let
     this go, huh? At the very least, we should be the first ones in
     there to spearhead the research--

     WEIR
     That's what this is about? You want to beat them to it? I'm sorry.
     The answer's no.

   [She leaves, followed by Beckett and Zelenka. McKay remains, clearly
   upset.]

   INT--ROOM IN BELKAN INN

   [Teyla steadies Ronon as the make their way into the room.]

     RONON
     I'm not tired. Why did we leave?

   [She lets him fall onto the bed.]

     TEYLA
     I believe you've had enough.

     RONON
     I believe I have.

     TEYLA
     Good night.

   [She starts to go.]

     RONON
     Teyla.

     RONON
     There are three hundred of my people.

   [He puts his hand to his face, clearly moved. Teyla closes the door
   behind her.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS

   [Sheppard opens his door to find McKay standing there.]

     MCKAY
     Harry K. Daghlian.

     SHEPPARD
     Who?

     MCKAY
     He was a scientist. Worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.
     He was only 26 years old. Accidentally irradiated himself while
     performing a critical mass experiment on two half-spheres of
     plutonium. It took him a month to die, and while his body was slowly
     shutting down from radiation poisoning, you know what he did with
     his last thirty days? Hmm? He worked. He tried until his last breath
     to understand what had happened to him so that others could learn
     from the tragedy. So that his work, his death wouldn't be rendered
     meaningless.

   [Sheppard nods but appears skeptical.]

     MCKAY
     Now, have you considered what would've happened if they'd just shut
     the project down after that?

     SHEPPARD
     This is different.

     MCKAY
     Is it? Collins' death is a pointless waste of life unless something
     comes of this, and I'm not sure that I can... I think I know what
     happened.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's hear it.

     MCKAY
     Can I come in?

     SHEPPARD
     No.

     MCKAY
     The Ancients had it wrong. Our mistake was using their equations.
     Look, I just did the calculations again myself. I did them three
     times just to be sure, and I am positive the problem is in the
     automatic containment protocols.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay, what's your fix?

     MCKAY
     I'm proposing that we adjust the field strength manually.

     SHEPPARD
     You saw how fast it spiked on you.

     MCKAY
     So we don't operate the generator at anywhere near its potential.
     Look, there's no need to be greedy. Even operating at fifty percent,
     it'll still generate the power of a dozen ZPMs.

     SHEPPARD
     How come the Ancients didn't figure this out?

     MCKAY
     Maybe they were caught up in the heat of battle, or maybe they
     thought they needed as much power as they could get. Maybe they
     weren't smart enough.

     SHEPPARD
     And you are?

     MCKAY
     No, I didn't say that, but I have the benefit of hindsight, they
     didn't.

     MCKAY
     Look, this is big. This is the wheel, the light bulb...the hot dog
     big.

     SHEPPARD
     Best-case scenario?

     MCKAY
     I win a Nobel Prize.

   [Sheppard smiles.]

     SHEPPARD
     Worst-case scenario?

     MCKAY

     We tear a hole in the fabric of the universe-- (seeing Sheppard's
     alarm)
     Which is much less likely to happen than the Nobel Prize. I mean,
     look, the risks are nothing compared to the potential benefits.
     Elizabeth will listen to you. I've never asked this of you before,
     but I think I've earned it. Trust me.

     WEIR
     I've already made this decision, John.

     CALDWELL
     If Dr. McKay says he's solved the problem, I don't see why we don't
     give him another shot.

     WEIR
     Isn't the Daedalus about ready to head back to Earth?

     CALDWELL
     Yes, we are, but I think you should know the Pentagon has taken a
     very keen interest in this vacuum energy.

     WEIR
     I'm sure they have, but the Pentagon doesn't make the decisions
     here.

     CALDWELL
     I may not have the power to overrule you on this, but when I get
     back to Earth, I'm going to be making the recommendation that Dr.
     McKay be allowed to continue his work to the highest authorities.
     Ultimately, Dr. Weir, this won't be up to you.

     WEIR
     Can Rodney guarantee that the same thing won't happen?

     SHEPPARD
     Nobody can do that.

     WEIR
     Then what's changed?

     SHEPPARD
     According to him, it's the Ancients' calculations that were wrong,
     not his.

     CALDWELL
     If McKay is that confident, I don't see why--

     WEIR
     Confidence is not something Dr. McKay is in any short supply of.

     CALDWELL
     With good reason. If anyone can do this--

     WEIR
     The Ancients could not do this. I mean, that's what it keeps coming
     back to for me.

     CALDWELL
     Isn't it possible that you have placed the Ancients on such high a
     pedestal, that you can't even consider the possibility that they may
     be wrong?

     WEIR
     Why are we mincing words, Colonel? You want the weapon.

     CALDWELL
     Yes. I do. A weapon that could effectively eliminate the Wraith
     threat is very attractive to me, and to the people that I work for.
     I'm not hiding that fact. But there's more to it, isn't there? No
     more hunting for ZPMs. The shield at full strength. Faster, more
     powerful ships...how about a power source that can provide the
     energy needs for an entire planet? No more fossil fuels.

     WEIR
     I get it, and if it worked as advertised, it would be wonderful. I'm
     trying to tell you... I know Rodney McKay, and there are times when
     I have to protect him from himself.

     SHEPPARD
     I can do that. Let me go back with him, just him and me. You can
     activate the Stargate any time you want to contact us by radio.

     WEIR
     He really sold you.

     SHEPPARD
     He asked me to trust him.

   EXT--DORANDA, DAY

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

   [Sheppard and McKay hook up laptops to the Ancient equipment.]

     MCKAY

     (very confident)
     I appreciate your support, Colonel, but don't worry. I try to make
     it a habit not to make the same mistake twice.

     SHEPPARD
     That was a joke, right?

     MCKAY
     No. I offer you my personal assurance that a surge like the one that
     happened before is inconceivable.

     SHEPPARD
     Do you want to run some power-up simulations first?

     MCKAY
     How about I carry out my plan, and you keep the hot coffee coming? I
     was, uh, joking again, right? Now, where were we?

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     ZELENKA
     Dr. Weir, I need to speak to you right away.

     WEIR
     What is it?

     ZELENKA
     I've finished going over the accident data. I think I know why the
     Ancients abandoned this technology.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The Stargate is active.]

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, this is Atlantis.

   [The scene shifts between the control room and the Dorandan lab as
   Zelenka, Weir, Sheppard, and McKay speak via radio.]

     SHEPPARD
     Go ahead.

     WEIR
     Is Dr. McKay with you?

     MCKAY
     Of course I am, but we're a little busy getting ready to run a test
     here.

     WEIR
     Actually I would like you to delay the test firing.

     SHEPPARD
     Why?

     WEIR
     We have reason to believe that the weapon's power source--it may not
     be controllable at any power level.

     MCKAY
     Radek?

     ZELENKA
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Okay, we have been over this. I am doing this manually, at half
     power. It's a cakewalk.

     ZELENKA
     It don't think it matters how much cake you walk on. I've been doing
     calculations of my own, and I believe the very act of trying to
     contain vacuum energy from our own space-time creates an environment
     where the laws of physics cease to apply.

     MCKAY
     What are you on about?

     ZELENKA
     As power output increases, new and exotic particles are continuously
     created and destroyed inside the containment chamber, interacting
     with each other, and with the field itself. Eventually, particles
     are created that cannot be predicted in this space-time. And they
     breach the containment field as hard radiation.

     MCKAY
     And as long as I'm monitoring the energy output manually, I can stop
     that before it happens.

     ZELENKA

     (intensely)
     You cannot predict something that is inherently unpredictable.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     I know what I'm doing.

     ZELENKA
     Rodney, I am trying to tell you as a friend, I have serious doubts.

     MCKAY
     Well, you're wrong. Sorry, but there it is. And to bring this up now
     when I'm about to do this smacks of nothing but professional
     jealousy.

     ZELENKA

     (shouting in frustration)
     Fine. Kill yourself, just like the Ancients did!

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean by that?

     ZELENKA
     I believe if the overload is allowed to continue, the weapon acts as
     a sort of release valve to prevent catastrophic containment failure.
     The Ancients barely managed to shut it down, and they lost their
     lives in the process.

     WEIR
     What we're suggesting is that the Wraith didn't kill everyone on
     that planet. It was the weapon itself.

     SHEPPARD
     That would explain why this place is the only thing left standing.

     MCKAY
     Congratulations, you've solved the mystery of how the Ancients
     screwed up ten thousand years ago. It doesn't mean that I will do
     the same. Look, I don't know how else to say this, but none of you
     are capable of understanding this on the same level that I do. And
     Zelenka, that includes you.

   [Zelenka throws up his hands in frustration.]

     WEIR
     Rodney, I cannot afford to lose either one of you. Now, tell me, can
     you do this?

     MCKAY
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD
     Are you sure?

     MCKAY
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD
     Are you sure you're sure?

     MCKAY
     I said yes!

     SHEPPARD
     Because if you're wrong--

     MCKAY
     I'm not!

   [They stare at each other for a few moments.]

     SHEPPARD
     We'll call you back after the test. How does that sound?

     WEIR
     You'd better.

     MCKAY

     (to Sheppard)
     I won't let you down.

   [Sheppard gives McKay a hard look and walks out.]

     RONON
     Fine.

     TEYLA
     We should really be getting back. Dr. Weir will be expecting us.

     RONON
     Kell is here.

     TEYLA
     What?

     RONON
     He's meeting with Hendon right now. Solen just told me. I have to
     see him.

     TEYLA
     And you would like me to arrange a meeting.

     RONON
     After yesterday, I don't think I'd get very far if I asked myself.

   [Teyla nods.]

   INT--ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA

     MCKAY

     (confidently)
     Okay, this is good. My equations are working like a charm. Power
     level is at forty percent, just to be on the safe side. I think
     we're ready for our test.

     SHEPPARD
     Where do you want the weapon targeted?

     MCKAY
     The debris orbiting the planet.

     SHEPPARD
     Sounds good.

     MCKAY
     Bringing the weapon online...now.

   [In the containment chamber, the power source pulses. The sound grows
   louder.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's that?

     MCKAY
     An energy surge. It's fine. I can regulate it.

   [His display shows temperatures moving into the red area.]

     SHEPPARD
     I thought you said you could contain--

     MCKAY
     The temperature inside the containment field is well within
     acceptable parameters. I'm staying ahead of it.

   [The display shows the temperatures continuing to rise.]

     MCKAY

     (becoming concerned)
     The levels are rising in the chamber.

   [Turning to Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     Re-route power from the secondary systems to the containment field.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm thinking we need to abort.

     MCKAY
     I can compensate. Just give me a minute.

     SHEPPARD
     It's overloading. Just like last time.

     MCKAY
     There is no logical reason this shouldn't be working!

     SHEPPARD
     McKay.

     MCKAY
     None of this should be happening! Look, the energy levels are
     spiking at a rate far greater than anything I predicted.

     SHEPPARD
     Shut it down!

   [McKay turns to look at Sheppard as if in disbelief. He shows a moment
   of doubt, then turns back to his computer.]

     MCKAY

     (angrily)
     Fine.

   [In the containment chamber, the energy pulses much more than before.
   McKay makes inputs to his computer, but nothing happens.]

     MCKAY
     It doesn't make any sense.

     SHEPPARD
     What's wrong?

     MCKAY

     (shocked, facing Sheppard)
     I can't shut it down.

     If we are to trade, I would know all the members of your party.

   of Kell's men point their weapons at Ronon and Teyla. Teyla pulls her
   knife.]

     Ronon, what have you done?

     RONON
     We all know who this man was, what he was. If anyone here believes
     he should be avenged...here I am.

   [Ronon pulls her hand away.]

     RONON
     He deserved worse.

     TEYLA
     You said he was like a father to you.

     RONON
     Kell commanded several infantry divisions on Sateda. And when the
     Wraith came, he ordered thousands to their deaths just to save
     himself. He was...he was a traitor and a coward. My only regret is
     that his death was quick.

     TEYLA

     I understand. In your place, I might have done the same... But
     believe me when I tell you that the others would not. We must not
     speak of this when we return to Atlantis. (threateningly)
     And if you ever use my friendship in such a way again, I will not be
     so understanding.

     SHEPPARD
     What was that?

     MCKAY
     The weapon's discharging to prevent a catastrophic overload.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, that's it. We're out of here.

     MCKAY

     (nearly shouting)
     What did I just say? The weapon is firing at random targets above
     the planet. This is the safest place to be right now.

     SHEPPARD
     This place isn't gonna be safe for very much longer.

     MCKAY
     I can bring it back under control. Just give me a second.

     SHEPPARD
     No, you can't!

     MCKAY

     (yanking away and turning back to his computer)
     One second!

     SHEPPARD
     I've seen this before, Rodney. Pilots who wouldn't eject when
     something went wrong trying to fix their planes right until it hit
     the ground.

     MCKAY

     (coming to a realization)
     Okay, we need to leave. I've waited too long. The weapon can't
     discharge enough power to avoid a catastrophic overload. This whole
     planet is going to go up.

     weapon locking onto us.

     SHEPPARD
     I know what I'm doing.

     MCKAY
     I'm just saying, be sure not to fly in a straight line.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney, shut up!

   EXT--DORANDA, DAY

   [The Jumper leaves the planet, maneuvering to avoid the energy weapons
   pulses passing all around it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Can I just say there's no way the Jumper can take even one direct
     hit?

     SHEPPARD
     I'll keep that in mind.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [Sheppard maneuvers the Jumper through the debris field, the weapon
   firing all around them.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     Weapon's locking onto us.

     SHEPPARD
     How about I fly us away from the planet, and return after the
     overload?

     MCKAY
     We can't.

     SHEPPARD
     Why not?

     MCKAY
     Look, don't you understand? This explosion is going to take out
     three-quarters of the solar system. There's no way we can fly far
     enough, fast enough. We have to head for the 'gate.

     SHEPPARD
     Dial the 'gate.

   [McKay starts dialing.]

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [The Jumper continues its jig-jagging flight while the weapon hits
   pieces of debris behind it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     How do you intend to avoid getting hit on the final approach?

     SHEPPARD
     I haven't figured that part out yet.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [The Jumper is leaving the debris field; the active Stargate is ahead.
   With the weapons fire close, the Daedalus moves into position between
   the Jumper and the planet.]

     CALDWELL

     (over radio)
     It's a good thing we stopped by to check your progress, Colonel.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL

     (into radio)
     Make a break for the Stargate. We'll run interference.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Copy that, Daedalus.

     CALDWELL

     (to navigator)
     Stand by to engage sub-light engines on my mark.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Recommend you go into hyperspace as soon as we go through. There's
     going to be a big bang.

     CALDWELL

     (over radio)
     Understood.

   EXT--SPACE ABOVE DORANDA

   [The Jumper goes through the 'gate. Daedalus enters hyperspace just as
   the entire planet explodes.]

   INT--ATLANTIS 'GATE ROOM

   [Ronon and Teyla arrive carrying their sacks of seed.]

     TEYLA
     Take this grain to the storage room.

   [She hands if off.]

   [Above them in the observation area, McKay and Weir argue. Teyla and
   Ronon overhear them, exchanging concerned looks.]

     WEIR
     ...everybody on this base. You are the smartest man we have.

     MCKAY
     I know!

     WEIR
     You knew there was a question about what you were doing. And you put
     your life and other people's lives at risk.

     MCKAY
     But--

     WEIR
     You destroyed three-quarters of a solar system!

     MCKAY
     Well, five-sixths. It's not an exact science.

     WEIR
     Rodney, give your ego a rest for one second?

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard sees McKay and turns the other way.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, Colonel. Colonel! I've been looking all over for you.

     SHEPPARD
     I heard.

   [Sheppard turns to face him, crossing his arms.]

     MCKAY
     I suppose I deserve that. Look, I just, um...I wanted to apologize
     about what happened. I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I wanted to assure
     you that I intend on being right again, about everything, effective
     immediately.

   [Sheppard smirks at him.]

     MCKAY
     That was a joke.

     SHEPPARD
     Good one.

   [Sheppard turns and steps into the transporter. Rodney rushes forward.]

     MCKAY
     I've already apologized to Elizabeth.

   [Sheppard reluctantly remains.]

     MCKAY
     And Radek and...and I thanked Colonel Caldwell for caring enough to
     spy on the experiment from orbit. Sent him a nice little e-mail,
     actually. But I saved you till last because, um... Honestly, I
     would...I would hate to think that recent events might have
     permanently dimmed your faith in my abilities... Or your trust. At
     the very least, I hope I can--I can earn that back.

     SHEPPARD
     That may take a while.

     MCKAY

     (saddened)
     I see.

     SHEPPARD

     (smiling)
     But... I'm sure you can do it, if you really, really try.

   [Sheppard activates the transporter controls, and the doors close.
   McKay smiles briefly, then sighs with some sadness.]

   FADE OUT
