   TEASER

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [McKay is flying the jumper, with Sheppard in the co-pilot seat. Gall
   takes a seat behind Sheppard, while wiping his face with a
   handkerchief. Another scientist, Abrams, sits behind McKay.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ease up on the controls a little.

     MCKAY
     I'm fine.

     SHEPPARD
     You're going to snap the damn things off. Ease up.

     MCKAY
     I'm just seeing what this baby can do.

     ABRAMS
     Did you just say "this baby"?

     MCKAY
     It's perfectly appropriate space pilot parlance.

     SHEPPARD
     Just try to fly the baby in a straight line.

     MCKAY
     I'm flying in a straight line.

   [Sheppard brings up a HUD display showing their flight path. It weaves
   back and forth around a straight line to their destination.]

     SHEPPARD
     Not so much.

     MCKAY

     (defensively, chastened)
     Well, in space, all motion is relative.

   [Gall fans himself with his handkerchief. He looks ill.]

     SHEPPARD
     You okay, Dr. Gall?

     GALL
     I get motion sickness.

     SHEPPARD
     These things have inertial dampeners. You shouldn't feel a thing.

     GALL
     I-I know we're moving. That's enough for me.

     SHEPPARD

     (leaning over to whisper to McKay)
     Why'd you choose this guy for the mission?

     MCKAY

     (leaning over as well)
     Brendan's the one who discovered the Lagrangian Point satellite was
     out here. Elizabeth felt he should see it for himself.

   [McKay has let go of the controls while talking.]

     SHEPPARD
     Don't let go of the controls!

     MCKAY

     (taking them back)
     Snapping doesn't help!

     SHEPPARD
     This is why parents get someone else to teach their kids how to
     drive.

     MCKAY
     I am both insulted and touched by that.

     GALL

     (looking out view-screen)
     Oh my God.

   [Out of the view-screen, a space structure comes into view.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The huge satellite has many components jutting out from a central
   structure. The Puddle Jumper approaches the much larger satellite.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The shadow of the satellite darkens the cabin.]

     SHEPPARD

     (turning in his seat)
     McKay...

     MCKAY
     Yes, yes, of course, please.

   [They exchange seats, Sheppard taking control.]

     SHEPPARD
     Holding station at one thousand meters.

     MCKAY
     We're almost a half a mile away and it's filling the windshield.
     This thing is enormous.

     GALL
     It's as large as a Goa'uld mothership. This might be the single
     largest weapons platform ever constructed.

     MCKAY
     It's probably the Ancients' last line of defense before Atlantis.

     SHEPPARD
     Any chance it's still operational? Because that would be a very good
     thing.

     ABRAMS
     Are you getting any energy readings?

     GALL
     Negative.

     SHEPPARD
     So it's dead?

     GALL
     Well, it warrants closer scrutiny, but, yeah.

     SHEPPARD
     Knocked out during the Ancients' last stand?

     MCKAY
     Or its power source is depleted. Ten thousand years is a long time.
     We should still take a closer look--

     ABRAMS
     Wait, wait. I'm getting something in the ultra-low frequency range.

   [He puts it on the speaker, and they all hear a rhythmic static.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where's it coming from?

   [The HUD shows a location on a map.]

     ABRAMS
     The planet.

     MCKAY
     It's a distress call...a Wraith distress call.

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Puddle Jumper keeps station near the weapons satellite.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     You're sure it's Wraith? In this solar system?

     MCKAY
     I know. Celestially speaking, it's right in our backyard.

     SHEPPARD
     We figure the Ancient satellite shot the Wraith ship down in the
     final battle for Atlantis.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into comm)
     And it's still putting out a signal after thousands of years?

   [The conversation switches between the control room and the Puddle
   Jumper.]

     MCKAY
     It's a very weak signal. Look, if any part of that ship is intact,
     the wealth of scientific and military knowledge we could acquire is
     invaluable.

     WEIR
     So what are you saying?

   We have to go down and take a look.</blockquote>

     WEIR
     You have to? It took you almost fifteen hours to get there.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, all the more reason we should have a look. We're already here.

     GALL
     I should mention that the planet's atmosphere is extremely ionized.
     Radio communication could be difficult.

   [Sheppard looks sharply at Gall, and McKay motions for him to shut up.]

     WEIR
     And it would take at least fifteen hours to send out any sort of
     rescue.

     MCKAY
     We'll be fine.

     WEIR
     Major?

     SHEPPARD
     I agree with McKay.

     WEIR
     Of course you do. How could either of you resist exploring a crashed
     alien spaceship?

     SHEPPARD
     Exactly.

     MCKAY
     I assure you, our interest is purely professional, Elizabeth.

     SHEPPARD
     Seriously, the amount of intel we could gather from their weapons
     system: codes, shields...

     WEIR
     All right. Proceed with extreme caution, please, and check in with
     me in three hours.

     MCKAY
     Well, three hours? That's hardly enough time--

     SHEPPARD
     Will do. Jumper One out.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The jumper has landed on the desert-like planet. McKay stands outside,
   putting chap stick on his lips. Abrams and Gall exit the ship as well,
   followed by Sheppard.]

     MCKAY

     (mocking)
     "Radio communication could be difficult."

     GALL
     Hey, she said yes, didn't she?

     MCKAY
     And no thanks to you.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, knock it off, guys. I've spent the last fifteen hours
     listening to you two.

   [Sheppard walks past them, but they don't follow him. He stops.]

     SHEPPARD
     Are we ready? All right, let's remember where we parked.

   [Sheppard activates the jumper's shield.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The four walk down a dry ravine with some foliage. Some small
   volcano-shaped mounds lie on the ground, emitting some smoke.]

     GALL
     Why didn't we just land next to the ship?

     SHEPPARD
     Just a precaution.

     ABRAMS
     A precaution for what? The Wraith ship crashed thousands of years
     ago.

     SHEPPARD
     Automated defenses.

     GALL
     I never thought of that.

     MCKAY

     Don't worry, Brendan. We weren't all built for fieldwork.
     (to Sheppard)
     Seriously, we're almost there, right?

   [A small insect-like light creature comes out of one of the small
   mounds and buzzes around the team.]

     ABRAMS
     What's that?

     GALL
     Some kind of a bug?

     SHEPPARD
     Space bug.

     ABRAMS
     It's giving off a pretty strong life-signs reading.

     MCKAY
     Uh, okay, did I mention how allergic I was to bee stings?

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe it smells the food.

     GALL
     Maybe he's just smelling the girlish fear.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, let's leave it be, and it'll leave us be.

     MCKAY

     (fearful)
     Guys...

   [They make their way around the bug.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [They make their way to the crashed Wraith ship, which is partially
   buried in sand. It is quite large.]

     ABRAMS
     Have you seen one like this before?

     SHEPPARD
     It's too small to be a hive ship.

     MCKAY
     Well, it's been here for a very long time. Maybe they've
     discontinued that model.

   [Sheppard checks the ship with binoculars and finds a large hole in the
   hull.]

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe, but whatever it is, it took a hell of a hit.

     GALL
     Score one for the Ancient satellite.

   [Through his binoculars, Sheppard sees skeletons lying outside the
   ship.]

     SHEPPARD
     There's still some skeletons down there. I guess everyone didn't die
     in the crash. Are you getting any life signs?

     MCKAY
     I think we can rule that out.

     SHEPPARD
     It's just a precaution.

     MCKAY
     Fine.

   [McKay takes out his life-signs detector, clearly annoyed.]

     MCKAY
     No, it's just us and the glowy bugs. Nothing coming from the ship.

     SHEPPARD
     Good. Let's go take a look.

   [They walk toward the ship.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [The team stops at the entrance left by the hull breach, which is
   covered with a curtain of Wraith "tissue".]

     MCKAY
     I'm picking up faint power readings.

     SHEPPARD
     Something had to be powering the distress beacon.

   [Sheppard enters, followed by McKay. Gall enters then notices Abrams
   has not followed him.]

     GALL
     Come on, Abrams.

     ABRAMS
     Maybe one of us should stay outside.

     GALL
     Look, I know how you feel, but how many opportunities like this are
     we going to get?

   [Abrams joins him.]

   [Later, the team is exploring the ship's interior, using their
   flashlights. They come upon a dead Wraith soldier, covered with cobwebs
   and dust.]

     ABRAMS
     This guy looks like he just laid down and died.

     MCKAY
     It's remarkably preserved.

     SHEPPARD
     Or it wasn't that long ago. All right. Beckett'll want samples.

   [McKay prepares to take samples.]

     MCKAY
     It is... Yeah. Okay...

   [He pulls aside some webbing to reveal aged tissue on the body.]

     MCKAY
     What the--?

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. This is different.

     MCKAY
     Wraith cannibalism?

     SHEPPARD
     Looks like it.

     MCKAY
     They feed off each other?

     SHEPPARD
     Probably as a last resort.

     ABRAMS
     I guess some of them tried to survive as long as possible.

     MCKAY
     Okay, that is incredibly disturbing.

     SHEPPARD
     No kidding. You know, I wonder if there's--

     GALL

     (from another room)
     Guys!

   [McKay, Sheppard, and Abrams go to find Gall.]

   INT--HUMAN STORAGE AREA, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [They find Gall in a large chamber full of pods.]

     GALL
     They're bodies, human bodies.

     SHEPPARD
     They have chambers like this on hive ships. I've never seen one so
     large before.

     GALL
     I don't understand.

     MCKAY
     The Wraith cocoon humans. They keep their bodies in suspended
     animation, so later they can... Yeah.

     SHEPPARD
     I think we just figured out what this ship is for.

     MCKAY
     It's a supply ship, on its way to feed the Wraith who were laying
     siege to Atlantis.

     GALL
     Well, that's terrifying.

     SHEPPARD
     Gall, Abrams, check it out, but be careful.

     GALL
     What? No, wait.

     ABRAMS
     Where are you going?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, the ship's got to have a bridge. Maybe we can get some useful
     intel.

     GALL
     So you're just leaving us here?

     MCKAY
     What's the problem? They're all dead.

     GALL
     That's the problem!

     SHEPPARD
     Just get some D.V. and a rough head count. We'll stay in radio
     contact.

     GALL
     That could be difficult. This part of the ship seems really
     shielded.

     SHEPPARD
     Weir only gave us a few hours. We'll check in every few minutes.

   [Sheppard leaves.]

     MCKAY

     (smiling)
     You wanted fieldwork. This...is fieldwork.

   [McKay jogs after Sheppard. Gall nervously pulls out a video camera.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

   [Weir talks to Ford.]

     WEIR
     Lieutenant, I'd like you to put a team on standby for a rescue
     mission.

     FORD
     Is the Major all right?

     WEIR
     I'm sure everything's fine. I'd just like to have a team ready.

     FORD
     So just in case?

     WEIR
     Yeah. Just in case.

     FORD
     Yes, ma'am.

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [McKay and Sheppard walk down a corridor.]

     MCKAY
     I'm not picking up anything in the E.M. spectrum. I may need to rig
     up a secondary power source so we can interface with their computer
     systems.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm just thinking out loud here...

     MCKAY
     What?

     SHEPPARD
     How long do you think the Wraith could feed on all those humans back
     there?

     MCKAY
     Well, they're capable of hibernating for hundreds of years at a
     time, but, I mean, think about it. Ten thousand years ago was
     roughly the dawn of human civilization.

     SHEPPARD
     So there's no chance that uh--

     MCKAY
     No, no, no, no, no. Are you kidding? Well...maybe.

     SHEPPARD
     McKay.

     MCKAY
     No. No. No living thing could survive that long under those
     conditions. It's ridiculous.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay.

     MCKAY
     That would require an incredible power source capable of sustaining
     the stored humans in suspended animation almost the entire time.

     SHEPPARD
     So it's possible?

     MCKAY
     Oh, my God. It is possible. We've got to get out of here.

   INT--HUMAN STORAGE AREA, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Gall, Abrams, this is Sheppard.

     GALL

     (startled)
     Major, are you trying to scare me to death?

     SHEPPARD
     I'm probably being a little overcautious, but we need to...

   [His voice is overtaken by static.]

     ABRAMS
     We need to what?

     GALL
     Major, say again. Your radio's breaking up.

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Let's fall back to our point of ingress. We're headed back to the
     jumper.

   [Sheppard and McKay head out.]

   INT--HUMAN STORAGE AREA, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

     GALL
     I think we're getting out of here.

   [A distortion of the air passes over them quickly.]

     ABRAMS
     What?

     GALL

     I just saw something in the corridor behind you. We can't go that
     way.
     (into radio)
     Major, I just saw something.

   INT--CORRIDOR, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     All right, stay put. We're coming back to you.

   [They start running.]

     ABRAMS

     (into radio)
     Understood. There's nothing out here. Brendan, you're just freaking
     out on me.

     GALL
     I'm telling you, I saw something.

   [Gall points his weapon toward Abrams, who puts up his hands.]

     ABRAMS
     Put that thing away. You're going to kill someone.

     GALL
     I know what I saw!

   [Something drops behind Gall; Abrams sees it.]

     ABRAMS
     Oh, my God.

   [Gall turns to see it's a Wraith. Smiling, the Wraith throws Gall aside
   then steps up to Abrams and starts feeding on him. Nearby, Sheppard and
   McKay hear Abrams' screams.</blockquote>

     SHEPPARD
     This way.

   [Moments later they come upon Abrams, now an old man sitting on the
   ground. They look around cautiously.]

   EXT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP ON PLANET, DAY

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [The Wraith drags Gall down the corridor. Gall is covered in fine
   webbing.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [McKay examines Abrams.]

     MCKAY
     He is dead.

     SHEPPARD
     Where's Gall?

     MCKAY
     I don't know.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Gall, this is Sheppard. Come in.

     MCKAY
     It must have taken him.

   [Sheppard looks at his life-signs detector; sees two dots moving.]

     SHEPPARD
     You're right. They're on the move.

   [Sheppard starts to disarm Abrams' body.]

     MCKAY
     What're you doing?

     SHEPPARD
     Taking his weapons and his ammo. Here.

     MCKAY
     I already have a gun.

     SHEPPARD
     Now you have two.

     MCKAY
     You're not planning on going after the Wraith?

     SHEPPARD
     I plan on going after Gall, then I plan on getting the hell out of
     here.

     MCKAY
     I swear there was nothing alive when I scanned for life signs.

     SHEPPARD
     They don't show up as life signs when they're hibernating. Okay.
     Let's go.

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [The Wraith checks over Gall's instruments. Beside him, Gall starts to
   wake up. He starts breathing heavily.]

     GALL
     Please!

   [The Wraith snarls at him.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, EVENING

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Ford, Teyla, and another soldier are suited up for a mission.]

     FORD
     They're not even overdue yet.

     WEIR
     It doesn't matter. Call it intuition, paranoia, or we can just call
     it a drill. Either way, I want you to go now.

     TEYLA
     We can always be called back, but if they are in trouble...

     WEIR
     Then every moment counts. Exactly. Ford, who's your pilot?

     FORD
     Markham.

     WEIR
     Good. He could use some piloting practice.

     FORD
     And I've packed enough ordnance to fight a small war.

     WEIR
     Let's hope you don't have to.

     FORD
     Yes, ma'am. Let's move out.

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [Sheppard and McKay come upon a dead Wraith. Sheppard takes oblong
   metal weapons from the body; they are grenade-like.]

     MCKAY
     What's that?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know, but I don't have the ordnance I should have, and it
     takes a lot to kill these guys. I'll take any edge I can get.

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [The Wraith speaks to Gall.]

     WRAITH
     What world are you from?

     GALL
     Y-You're going to kill me anyway.

     WRAITH
     You have come here by ship. Where is it?

     GALL
     You're going to kill me anyway.

     WRAITH
     But not all at once.

   [The Wraith starts to feed on Gall, who screams.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [Sheppard and McKay hear the screaming.]

     SHEPPARD
     Okay... Stay behind me. Shoot only when I tell you to shoot.

   [They move off together.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [The Wraith hears footsteps, smiles at Gall, and jumps up into the
   ceiling to get away. Sheppard and McKay arrive and are shocked at
   Gall's condition, wrapped in webbing, aged, and with an open wound on
   his chest. Sheppard approaches him.]

     GALL
     I'm sorry.

     SHEPPARD
     Shh.

   [Sheppard checks the life-signs detector.]

     SHEPPARD
     He's left the ship.

   [Sheppard starts to free Gall's face from the webbing.]

     GALL
     It killed Abrams.

     SHEPPARD
     We know.

     GALL
     It was so fast... It fed off me.

     MCKAY
     You're going to be all right.

     GALL
     It was taking my life. I could feel it. I could feel it--

     SHEPPARD
     All right, all right, all right. Listen to me. Listen to me. You're
     still here. Can you move?

     GALL

     (crying)
     Nothing below my shoulders.

     MCKAY
     I'm sure the paralysis is just temporary. You'll be all right in a
     few hours.

     GALL
     I told him where we left the jumper. He took my remote.

     MCKAY
     He won't be able to fly it.

     SHEPPARD
     Do we know that for a fact?

     MCKAY
     I'm sure the Wraith were the main reason the Ancient technology only
     works if the operator has a specific gene.

     SHEPPARD
     Either way, he's still going to have all of our weapons, food and
     water.

     MCKAY
     Who cares?

     SHEPPARD
     What if he can use our subspace radio to signal his friends?

     MCKAY
     He might be able to do that.

     SHEPPARD
     Not if I can get there first.

   [Sheppard gets up and faces McKay.]

     MCKAY
     He's got a head start.

     SHEPPARD
     I can be pretty fast.

     MCKAY
     Elizabeth will send another jumper. We just need to wait--

     SHEPPARD
     Stay with him.

     GALL
     No. Please don't leave us.

     MCKAY
     He's right. We should stick together.

     SHEPPARD
     He killed Abrams.

     MCKAY

     (agitated)
     And I'm as sorry about that as you are, but just because we both
     made an error in judgment--

     SHEPPARD

     (shouting)
     I don't have time to argue about this! Now, set your radio to
     channel two, but don't use it till you hear from me.

   [Sheppard starts jogging away.]

     MCKAY

     (yelling)
     Major. Major!
     (quietly, to Gall)
     It's fine, just... Okay.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard runs out of the ship and along a ridge back toward the
   jumper. He gets back to the ravine with the insect mounds and jogs past
   them.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [McKay tends to Gall, removing the rest of the webbing. He looks at his
   own hand, then at Gall's poor condition. He checks the life-signs
   detector.]

     GALL
     Anything?

     MCKAY
     No. Hopefully there's just the one.

     GALL
     You're not going to let me die out here, are you?

     MCKAY
     No, don't be ridiculous.

     GALL
     You know, because people would talk.

     MCKAY
     And why would they do that?

     GALL
     It's obvious. You're afraid I'll outshine you. My mind. My youth...

   [They realize the irony of the statement. McKay places a bandage on
   Gall's chest.]

     GALL
     How much of my life did he take?

     MCKAY
     You look fine.

     GALL
     Because that's what they do, isn't it? They take years off of your
     life. I look old, don't I?

     MCKAY
     You look older, yes.

     GALL
     Show me.

     MCKAY
     There's no point in doing this. You just--

     GALL
     Rodney. Show me.

   [McKay holds up a mirror so Gall can see himself.]

     GALL

     (distraught)
     Oh, my God!

     MCKAY
     I don't know how it works, Brendan. I don't think anybody does.
     Maybe you haven't really aged. Maybe it doesn't work that way. Look,
     it's possible that, in time you could get better. The important
     thing is that you're still alive... Can you move yet?

     GALL
     I think I'm starting to get some feeling back in my extremities.

     MCKAY
     Well, there's something. What? I'm just trying to help here. Look,
     you're the one who had to find the stupid satellite.

     GALL
     Ah, don't make me laugh.

     MCKAY
     Yeah. You shouldn't laugh. It's...it's not so good.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [The Wraith has followed the team's trail back to the jumper, which is
   still invisible due to its cloak. He holds up Gall's controller and
   uncloaks it.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET

   [The Wraith goes to the cockpit and tries activating various controls,
   but nothing happens. In frustration, he screams. Using the life-signs
   detector, Sheppard approaches the jumper and takes cover. He can hear
   the Wraith screaming. He raises his machine gun.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A puddle jumper travels through space.]

     Yes, ma'am.

   INT--FORD'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     WEIR

     (over comm)
     Gall said something about radio being a problem on the surface, so,
     hopefully, the jumper's subspace communications are just down.

     FORD

     We're prepared to do whatever we need to do.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     You're on the other side of the solar system, Lieutenant. It's going

     Yes, ma'am, it is.

     McKay.

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     We're still here.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard is in the same position, watching the jumper.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     The son of a bitch beat me to it. He's fast.

   [The conversation switches between McKay's and Sheppard's positions.]

     MCKAY
     Then you should get back here.

     SHEPPARD
     Negative.

     MCKAY
     There's no point in you being out there--

     SHEPPARD
     He's aboard my ship.

     MCKAY
     What are you, Captain Kirk? What good's it going to do him?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know. Maybe he can hot-wire the damn thing. I don't want to
     take a chance.

   [Sheppard sees small bits of snow in the shade of the rocks beside
   him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Do you have any idea how long the days are on this planet?

     MCKAY
     No. Why?

     SHEPPARD
     Because I've got a feeling the nights are pretty damn cold, sub-zero
     cold.

     MCKAY
     We're six hours overdue. Assuming they waited an hour before sending
     a rescue mission--

     SHEPPARD
     There's a very good chance it's going to be dark before another
     jumper can get here. If we play the waiting game, the guy who's been
     around for ten thousand years is going to win.

     MCKAY
     Major, anyone or anything capable of surviving that long is going to
     be a serious adversary.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, not if I get him out in the open. He won't know about our
     weapons. If all goes well, I'll fly the jumper back and pick you up.

     MCKAY
     And if all doesn't go well?

     SHEPPARD
     It will.

     MCKAY
     Things haven't gone all that well thus far.

     SHEPPARD
     You know, Rodney, these guys do die if you have enough firepower.

     MCKAY
     Well, eventually, yes, but--

     SHEPPARD
     Try and stay positive. How's Gall feeling?

     MCKAY
     His can move his toes.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, see? Things are looking up.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET

   [The frustrated Wraith searches the storage bins, throwing supplies
   around. He finds a pistol but sets it down as if uninterested.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over comm)
     This is Major John Sheppard. That's my ship you're messing with. I'd
     like it back.

     WRAITH

     (into comm)
     This ship is Lantian.

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

     SHEPPARD

     (into comm)
     Yes, it is.

   [The conversation switches between the Wraith's and Sheppard's
   positions.]

     WRAITH
     The Lantians were on the verge of defeat.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you weren't around for the end of the war. Your side lost.

     WRAITH
     Impossible.

     SHEPPARD
     It's true. You're the last of your kind.

     WRAITH
     Their city was under siege. Atlantis was all that remained. Victory
     was inevitable.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you can see for yourself my ship is Lantian. I'm living proof
     we're still around, but the Wraith were all gone. No one's left but
     you.

   [Sheppard lifts his weapon.]

     WRAITH
     What you say cannot be true.

     SHEPPARD
     Why don't you come down to your own ship and see for yourself? I'll
     be waiting for you.

   [The Wraith takes the bait and steps to the top of the ramp of the
   jumper. Sheppard fires on the Wraith with his P-90, and it falls to the
   ramp. Sheppard cautiously approaches. The Wraith wakes up but doesn't
   move. Sheppard fires into its body a few more times, and it lies
   immobile.]

   [Sheppard approaches more closely. Unseen, the Wraith grabs the pistol
   it had found earlier. It sits up and starts shooting at Sheppard, who
   is firing back. The Wraith shoots Sheppard in the left upper arm.
   Sheppard falls and rolls behind a rock for cover. Sheppard can't get
   his P-90 to fire, and the Wraith fires until its gun is empty.]

   [The Wraith gets up slowly. Sheppard retreats to the cover of nearby
   sand dunes. The Wraith finds a second pistol and raises it, but
   Sheppard is no longer in sight.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard rolls down a sand dune. He gets up slowly and starts to jog
   further away, favoring his injured arm. He falls to his knees near some
   tall grasses. He checks his P-90 again. It doesn't work, so he tosses
   it to the ground. He pulls a field dressing from his vest and starts to
   wrap it around his arm.]

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

     WRAITH
     You cannot hope to defeat me!

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard hears the Wraith.]

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

   [Seemingly weakened from all of the bullet wounds, the Wraith moves
   back inside the Jumper.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [McKay massages Gall's hands, and he's finally able to move them.]

     MCKAY
     There. What'd I tell you, huh?

     GALL
     Rodney, I don't feel so good.

     MCKAY
     Water. I'll lend you some water.

   [He helps Gall drink from his canteen.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     McKay...

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Major, what's happening?

   [The conversation switches between McKay's and Sheppard's positions as
   they speak by radio.]

     SHEPPARD
     I thought you should know--round one was a draw.

     MCKAY
     I don't like the sound of that.

     SHEPPARD
     Me neither. I took some fire.

     MCKAY
     Are you injured?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, that's what I mean by "I took some fire." But I don't think
     it's too bad, but my P-90's out of commission. He found a 9-mil in
     the jumper, figured out how to use it pretty fast.

   [Sheppard checks the magazine on his pistol.]

     MCKAY
     Well, the Wraith will heal itself.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. No kidding. I put at least twenty shots into him, and a couple
     more for good measure. I've seen Wraith go down and stay down with
     far less. This guy's different somehow.

   [He checks the grenade-like weapons he had collected.]

     MCKAY
     Dr. Beckett has theorized that a Wraith's ability to heal itself is
     directly proportional to how recently the Wraith has fed, and
     he's...fed pretty recently.

     SHEPPARD
     I think there's got to be more to it than that. Can Gall move his
     fingers yet?

     MCKAY
     Barely.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, then stick a gun in his hand.

     MCKAY
     Major?

     SHEPPARD
     Just in case I don't make it back. Sheppard out.

     MCKAY
     That's comforting, huh? All right. Water.

   [He goes back to helping Gall.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard opens and then closes one of the Wraith weapons. It
   activates, making a high-pitched whine. A red light starts flashing.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, crap!

   [He throws it away and ducks. It blows up, raining dirt on him.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET

   [The Wraith hears the explosion.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard rests on his stomach for a moment.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [McKay has heard the explosion, perhaps over the radio.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Major, what the hell was that?

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     I almost blew myself up.

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     What?

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Stay off the radio. I'm busy.

     MCKAY

     (to Gall)
     Right. He's busy.

     GALL
     You want to get out there and help him, don't you?

     MCKAY
     What? Me go up against a Wraith? Are you kidding?

     GALL
     You do. I can tell. You've changed. You really want to get out
     there.

     MCKAY
     Shut up.

     GALL
     Don't get me wrong. I'm impressed. You want in the fight. The Rodney
     McKay I knew would never--

     MCKAY

     (serious)
     You heard the man. We're staying right here... All right. Take this,
     but don't shoot at anything until I tell you to, okay?

     GALL
     Okay.

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard has approached the jumper again, maintaining cover behind a
   rock. He uses his binoculars to check on the Wraith, who is again
   rifling through the storage bins. Sheppard opens a power bar and starts
   to eat it. One of the light insects approaches. Sheppard tries to brush
   it away.]

     SHEPPARD
     You want some of this?

   [He places a small piece of the bar on his leg. The creature takes it
   and flies away. Sheppard takes another bite. The creature comes back in
   a swarm of others. Sheppard tires to wave them away.]

     SHEPPARD
     Okay, okay. That's enough.

   [He throws a large chunk of the bar away, and the swarm dashes off for
   it. He rises up to take a look at the Wraith and sees it working on the
   ship systems.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET

   [The Wraith exchanges crystals in the overhead panel, breathing
   laboriously.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard climbs up a sand dune and places a flair in the sand near the
   top.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET

   [The Wraith tries to re-wire the jumper controls.]

   EXT--PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard lights the flare then runs down the dune and away from the
   area.]

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard resumes his position near the jumper. As the flare starts to
   spew orange smoke, Sheppard fires two shots to get the Wraith's
   attention.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET

   [Hearing the shots, the Wraith goes to the front of the jumper. It sees
   the orange smoke and smiles. It goes to the ramp and exits the jumper.
   It activates something on its wrist before walking toward the smoke.
   Sheppard runs for the jumper, but when he gets to within a few feet of
   it, he's repelled and thrown to the ground by a shield. He gets up and
   runs away again. The Wraith has reached the flare and realizes it was a
   diversion.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

     MCKAY
     You're right. I should go out there.

     GALL
     I didn't say you should. I said you wanted to.

     MCKAY
     Because I should.

     GALL
     No, you shouldn't. But don't let me stop you. If you really think
     that you can help the Major by going out--

     MCKAY
     I can't leave you here.

     GALL
     Yes, you can. What difference does it make? You and I both know I'm
     not going to make it.

     MCKAY
     Stop being so dramatic. You're getting stronger by the minute.

     GALL
     I've never felt so weak.

     MCKAY
     Then stop talking.

     GALL
     I'm dying, Rodney. I can feel it.

     MCKAY

     (angry)
     Stop it!

     GALL
     I'm not getting better. I'm getting worse. He left me with just
     enough life so that you'd have to watch me die.

     MCKAY
     Listen to me. All you need is a good meal, a pot of tea, and to stop
     talking, and--

   [Gall closes his eyes. McKay rushes to him.]

     MCKAY
     Brendan! I'm sorry.

     GALL
     You said to stop talking.

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry, I thought you'd... Apologies. As you were.

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

   [While Sheppard waits behind cover, the Wraith returns and tests the
   shield. Sheppard uses his pocket knife as a mirror to watch from behind
   the rock. The swarm of light creatures returns. Sheppard pulls out his
   power bar and throws the rest of it over to the side. The swarm
   follows. He resumes watching the Wraith using his pocket knife. The
   Wraith runs into the swarm and starts grabbing at the creatures.]

     SHEPPARD
     Not now, guys.

   INT--FORD'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     MARKHAM
     We may be able to make radio contact now, sir.

     FORD

     (into comm)
     Major, this is Lieutenant Ford. Come in. Major, we should be there
     inside an hour. Please respond.

     TEYLA
     Perhaps we are still too far away.

     MARKHAM
     Or maybe they can't get a signal on the planet.

     FORD
     See if you can make this thing go a little faster.

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

   [The Wraith walks around, looking for Sheppard.]

     WRAITH
     Do you think I'm a fool, Major Sheppard? There is nowhere for you to
     go on this world. When I feed upon you, I will savor the taste of
     your defiance.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Hey, you. Over here. On the ground, the radio.

   [The Wraith sees the radio on the ground.]

     WRAITH
     The days on this planet are long, but the nights are cold. Sooner or
     later, I will have you.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I can't hear you threatening to suck the life out of me till you hit
     the button on the radio.

   [The Wraith hesitates, then picks up the radio. It is sitting on one of
   the grenade devices. It explodes, sending the Wraith backward, burned
   and apparently lifeless. Sheppard checks the Wraith through his
   binoculars but doesn't approach it.]

   INT--CRASHED WRAITH SHIP

   [McKay gets up, weapon raised.]

     MCKAY
     You hear that?

     GALL
     No.

     MCKAY
     I thought I heard something. Maybe there's another one hibernating.

     GALL
     No.

     MCKAY
     It's been too long. I think the Major could be in trouble, and if
     he's in trouble, we're in trouble.

     GALL
     Then go.

     MCKAY
     Do you think you could move?

     GALL
     Not a chance. I'm not going anywhere.

     MCKAY
     Okay. That's okay.

     GALL
     Go. Rodney, just go. Save the day.

   [McKay faces the way out while talking to Gall.]

     MCKAY
     What I really want to do is call him on the radio, but I'm afraid if
     he's hiding from the Wraith, I might inadvertently give away his
     position, and let's face it, what chance would we have against the
     Wraith if Sheppard can't take him out? I was hoping you'd be strong
     enough, then I--

   [Behind him, Gall shoots himself. McKay turns around and sees him.]

     MCKAY

     (devastated)
     Oh, no.

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard watches from behind the boulder as the Wraith wakes and gets
   up.]

     SHEPPARD
     You've got to be kidding me.

     WRAITH
     I have fed upon countless thousands of humans and Lantians, even
     upon my own crew, and I will feed upon you before this day is done.

   [The Wraith fires its pistol at Sheppard, who fires back.]

     FORD

     (over comm)
     Major, this is Lieutenant Ford. Please respond.

     SHEPPARD

   EXT--NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER ON PLANET, DAY

     SHEPPARD

     Well, in that case, your timing sucks. Get here as soon as you can.

   [The Wraith continues to approach Sheppard's position, firing.]

     SHEPPARD

     (shouting to be heard)
     You need me to get off this planet. I'm the only one who can fly
     that ship.

   [The Wraith stops for a moment.]

     WRAITH
     I will use your dead hands to operate its controls.

   [The Wraith resumes firing. Sheppard's gun is empty. The Wraith's is as
   well. Sheppard pulls out his knife and approaches the Wraith, who
   growls, smiling. It raises its hand at Sheppard, and he spears it on
   the knife. It slaps Sheppard across the face with the other hand,
   throwing him to the ground. Sheppard rolls over and partially sits up,
   but doesn't get up. The Wraith moves in on him. McKay shoots it in the
   back twice.]

     MCKAY
     Major?

     SHEPPARD
     McKay!

     MCKAY
     What do I do now?

     SHEPPARD
     Keep firing everything you've got!

   [The Wraith turns toward McKay, who empties his gun into its chest.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, now what?

     SHEPPARD
     Reload.

   [McKay starts to reload, but not quickly. The Wraith smiles, deciding
   whom to attack first.]

   INT--FORD'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     Sir, we're picking you up on the HUD.

   McKay. McKay empties another magazine into it, but it keeps coming.]

     MCKAY
     No more bullets!

   [Sheppard comes up from behind and hits the Wraith with a pistol. The
   Wraith turns and pushes him in the chest, throwing him into the air and
   several feet away. McKay watches as Sheppard doesn't get up. Sheppard
   has placed the power bar in the Wraith's belt. Now the light creatures
   swarm around the Wraith.]

   and leaving nothing but a crater. Sheppard takes a look around to be
   sure.]

     Other than this and a few cracked ribs...

     No.
