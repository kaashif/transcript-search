   TEASER

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus is under attack by two hive ships, its shields taking most of
   the energy.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Caldwell is in command. Sheppard stands beside between him and Marks,
   hanging onto their chairs as the ship rocks from the blasts.]

     SHEPPARD
     With some 302s, we might be able to take out the hyperdrive, save us
     some time.

     CALDWELL
     Do it.

     KLEINMAN
     Shields are at sixty percent!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Four F-302s launch from the hangar bay of Daedalus. The pilots speak
   to each other over their radios.]

     MEYERS
     I've got incoming.

     SHEPPARD
     Dagger 3 and 4, let's try to keep these darts off our six.

     MEYERS
     Roger that.

   [Sheppard moves forward and fires on one of the Hive ships. After a
   moment, many darts come out to face them, then split up to follow each
   pair of 302s. As each speak, they are shown in their cockpits.]

     ANDERS
     Half the bogies are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4. We've got the other
     half hot on our tail.

     MEYERS
     I'm taking fire. I've lost the generator.

     SHEPPARD
     Stand by to break left on my mark. Mark! Fox Four.

   [Sheppard's ship fires two missiles at one of the Hives. They explode
   amidst the swarm of Darts, destroying many.]

     SHEPPARD
     We're in the clear. Continue to target.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KLEINMAN
     Shields are under twenty percent.

     CALDWELL
     Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship. We need to jump
     out of here as soon as possible.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Sheppard's F-302 moves in very fast, very close to the Hive.]

     SHEPPARD
     Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL
     Unless you can shut down their weapons, it's not going to do us much
     good.

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

   [Sheppard sees two boggies move around behind his ship.]

     SHEPPARD
     Damn it. Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run to the
     target hyperdrive.

     MEYERS
     Roger that, leader. I'm on my way.

   EXT--SPACE

   [She takes out the two boggies. She and Sheppard speak over the
   radios.]

     MEYERS
     The remaining darts are returning to the hives.

     SHEPPARD
     Can you go to max thrust?

     MEYERS
     Negative.

     SHEPPARD
     Head back to the Daedalus.

     MEYERS
     Roger that.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KLEINMAN
     The hives are opening hyperspace windows.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Both Hives enter hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Caldwell gets up and approaches the forward viewscreen.]

     CALDWELL
     Why the hell'd they do that?

     KLEINMAN
     Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.

     CALDWELL
     Sheppard?

     KLEINMAN
     His fighter isn't one of them. The only contacts I have on screen
     are wreckage.

     CALDWELL
     What about his locator beacon?

     KLEINMAN
     Nothing, sir. He's just gone.

     CALDWELL
     Understood.

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

   [Sheppard removes his air mask and looks upward through his window.]

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. This is new.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Sheppard's F-302 is attached to the top of one of the Hives as it
   speeds through hyperspace.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Caldwell climbs the stairs to the control room, where he meets Weir.]

     WEIR
     Colonel Caldwell. What's the status of the repairs?

     CALDWELL
     Ongoing. We lost a few key personnel in the attack.

     WEIR
     Yes, we did.

     CALDWELL
     I'm sorry.

     WEIR
     So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them. I've just briefed
     General Landry. We're to check in in an hour and advise him of our
     response to this.

   [The walk to Weir's office, Zelenka and Teyla following.]

     CALDWELL
     I've got a broken ship and serious casualties. I don't know what
     sort of response you have in mind, but--

     WEIR
     I want you to redeploy immediately.

     CALDWELL
     Excuse me?

     WEIR
     As long as they're still in striking distance, we have to at least
     try.

     CALDWELL
     You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.

     WEIR
     Radek?

     ZELENKA
     Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives using the
     information they were able to steal from our database. The Aurora
     mission reports--

     CALDWELL
     Obviously.

     ZELENKA
     However, their ships are organic in nature. They will need to make
     brief pauses to recover from the effects of hyperspace radiation.

     WEIR
     Where and when?

     ZELENKA
     Uh, yeah, uh, it will take some time to calculate.

     WEIR
     Go.

     ZELENKA
     Okay.

   [Zelenka leaves.]

     CALDWELL
     Look, Dr. Weir, I want to go after these bastards as much as you do,
     but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now. Our shields
     are severely depleted. Several decks are inaccessible. Even if we
     could catch up with them, I don't know how long we'd last.

     WEIR
     Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.

     TEYLA
     It was recalled the moment the Wraith computer virus was revealed.

     CALDWELL
     And it's in no better shape than Daedalus.

     WEIR
     It will fly, and by the time you reach the hive ships, it should
     also be able to fight.

     CALDWELL
     And if it isn't?

     WEIR
     Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the
     hive ships before they reach Earth. They cannot be allowed to get
     that far, Steven.

     CALDWELL
     You know what you're asking me to do?

     WEIR
     I do.

     CALDWELL
     There's still repairs that need to be made.

     WEIR
     Do what you have to do.

   [He leaves. Weir and Teyla exchange concerned looks.]

   EXT--HYPERSPACE

   [The two Hives move through hyperspace.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP

   [Ronon and McKay are trapped beside each other inside Wraith pods,
   stored there as future food. McKay's face is partially protruding from
   the webbing. Ronon is pushing hard on the webbing of his pod.]

     MCKAY
     They couldn't have. Even if they somehow deduced the location of
     Earth, they still wouldn't be able to get there, not unless they...
     They downloaded something along with the hive ship plans, something
     like spyware. It's like when I stupidly downloaded por--Music. When
     I downloaded music. I asked them to do it. I did this. I'm
     responsible for the destruction of my own planet.

     RONON
     If anybody was going to do it, it'd be you.

     MCKAY
     Thank you. Thank you so much for that!

     RONON
     Stop worrying about it now. Just focus.

     MCKAY
     Focus on what? What is there to focus on? I'm stuck in a cocoon.

     RONON
     Getting out of here.

     MCKAY
     Oh, right. Of course. Now, why didn't I think of that? Of course.
     Here goes. Um, nope. Still can't move. I'm pretty sure they're
     struggle-proof, there, big guy.

   EXT--HYPERSPACE

   [The two Hives move through hyperspace. Sheppard's F302 sits on a
   surface on the underside of one. His ship is tiny compared to the Hive,
   merely a speck on the hull.]

   INT--F303 COCKPIT

     SHEPPARD
     Okay, can't sit here forever.

   [He brings up a control panel that asks if he wants to disengage
   docking clamps. He hesitates.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hit them while they're in hyperspace. They'll never know what
     happened. Is that even possible?

   FLASHBACK

   INT--ATLANTIS CAFETERIA

   [McKay and Zelenka argue as Sheppard eats and looks between them at an
   attractive female crew-member.]

     MCKAY
     There is no reason to believe that their hyperspace field is any
     different from ours, and we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus
     while in hyperspace.

     ZELENKA
     No, I'm simply talking about maneuvering within the field, not
     passing through it. What do you think?

   [The woman smiles back at Sheppard.]

     ZELENKA
     Colonel?

     SHEPPARD
     Hmm? What? Yes.

     MCKAY
     He's not listening.

   END FLASHBACK

   INT--F303 COCKPIT

     SHEPPARD
     I've got to pay more attention to those guys.

   [He pushes the "no" selection on releasing the docking clamps.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP

   [Michael approaches the Queen of the Hive.]

     QUEEN
     Yes, Michael?

     MICHAEL
     You should have told me that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.

     QUEEN
     Are you feeling sympathy for them?

     MICHAEL
     No. But I don't understand why I wasn't told. I told you of their
     plan because I believed it was a viable way of--

     QUEEN
     You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful. But I
     fear, Michael that the lingering stench of what they've transformed
     you into will never fade.

   [Michael hisses at her, then turns and walks away.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [The gate is active. Weir speaks to Landry over a video link.]

     WEIR

     In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace
     (showing a map)
     here. It's just outside of the Pegasus Galaxy.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Weir speaks into a laptop.]

     WEIR
     There they will pause for 15 hours. If Daedalus and Orion break
     orbit on our current schedule, they should be able to reach those
     coordinates in just under fourteen hours, best possible speed.

     LANDRY
     Narrow window.

     WEIR
     It's the only window, sir.

   [The rest of the conversation switches between the two control rooms.]

     LANDRY
     Understood. Now, the International Oversight Advisory want you to
     brief them on this matter.

     WEIR
     When would you like me to dial in again?

     LANDRY
     You misunderstand me. I mean in person, and I mean right now. The
     president himself assigned--

     WEIR
     I can't just leave, not now.

     LANDRY
     I'm afraid that's not up to you.

     WEIR
     There is far too much going on here.

     LANDRY
     Doctor... You've done all you're going to do for now. I need you to
     step through that gate. They're waiting for you in my briefing
     room... Dr. Weir?

     WEIR
     I see.

   [She signs off and stands up.]

     WEIR

     (upset)
     Teyla...we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
     Once that happens, I'd like to suspend all gate travel till this
     whole thing is over.

     TEYLA
     Of course.

     WEIR
     And I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready to leave.

     TEYLA
     I know what to do, Elizabeth.

     WEIR
     Of course you do.

     TEYLA
     I will see you when you return.

     WEIR
     Thank you.

   [Teyla sits in Weir's chair. Weir walks down to the gate room and
   through the active wormhole, carrying only a laptop.]

   EXT--WORMHOLE

   [The travel is much longer than an intra-galaxy trip.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Weir walks through. Landry awaits her at the bottom of the ramp. The
   walk and talk, making their way down the corridor and up to the control
   room.]

     LANDRY
     Welcome back to Earth.

     WEIR
     Thank you, general.

     WEIR
     It's wonderful to be here.

     LANDRY
     I can see that.

     WEIR
     You know, I considered disobeying your order. There wouldn't have
     been too much you could do about it.

     LANDRY
     You made the right decision in coming.

     WEIR
     We're in the middle of a crisis, General. This is absolutely--

     LANDRY
     Don't bite my head off, Elizabeth. The recall order didn't come from
     me.

     WEIR
     Who it came from doesn't matter.

     LANDRY
     What if I told you it came from the President?

     WEIR
     I wouldn't believe you.

     LANDRY
     And you'd be right. But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens
     on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race. The President
     had no choice but to accede to the I.O.A.'s demand that you be
     brought back to explain yourself.

     WEIR

     (looking up toward briefing room)
     So, what do they really want?

     LANDRY
     To point fingers, cover their asses...

     WEIR
     I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.

     LANDRY
     They're bureaucrats, Elizabeth. You'll have them for breakfast.

   EXT--HYPERSPACE

   INT--WRAITH HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Michael walks down a corridor. Two Wraith drones step in front of him
   and block his path.]

     MICHAEL
     There is work I must attend to... Stand aside... Am I to sit quietly
     in my quarters?

   [They ignore him. He hisses at them strongly, then walks back the way
   he came.]

   INT--WRAITH HIVE SHIP POD SECTION

     MCKAY
     You know, these things are actually quite comfortable. Surprisingly
     warm, take all the pressure off the spine... I suppose they're as
     good a place as any to witness the end of humanity as we know it.

     RONON
     You're wasting your energy talking.

     MCKAY
     Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish,
     and we break out? Then what, huh? We're still on a hive, we're still
     traveling through hyperspace, probably in the massive void between
     our two galaxies...where there aren't even planets, let alone
     Stargates. What then, huh? Do we fly home on the wings of
     imagination? Is that what we do, Ronon?

     RONON
     You can sit here and die if you like, but I'm not giving up.

     MCKAY
     Oh, fine. I will.

     RONON
     Fine!

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Hives exit hyperspace and come to a stop in space.]

   INT--F302 COCKPIT

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. Time to do some damage. Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB ABOARD HIVE SHIP

   [Michael has Ronon and Rodney's gear, including their radios, which
   come to life with Sheppard's voice.]

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney? I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please
     respond. If you're near a radio, I need you to come in. I need to
     know your location. Guys?

     MICHAEL
     Colonel Sheppard? Is that you?

   [The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard's F302 and
   Michael's lab.]

     SHEPPARD
     Who's this?

     MICHAEL
     You know me as Michael.

     SHEPPARD
     Sorry...I got the wrong number.

     MICHAEL
     Ronon and Dr. McKay are still alive.

     SHEPPARD
     What are you going to do with them?

     MICHAEL
     If you want them to live, listen to me... If your friends are in
     pursuit, you need to disable these ships in order for them to reach
     us.

     SHEPPARD
     If you really want to help, why don't you just do that?

     MICHAEL
     They would know.

     SHEPPARD
     Aren't you "they"?

     MICHAEL
     Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, I don't know. I was pretty deceived.

     MICHAEL
     It seems, Colonel, that because of what you did to me...the Wraith
     no longer see me as one of their own.

     SHEPPARD

     (falsely sympathetic)
     Oh, that's why you want to help, because you don't feel welcome.

     MICHAEL
     We don't have time to discuss this.

     SHEPPARD
     Sure we do. I've got a...good three hours of air left.

     MICHAEL
     Where are you?

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, wouldn't you like to know.

     MICHAEL
     I need to know what level you are on so I can guide you from there.

     SHEPPARD
     You mean, trust you.

     MICHAEL
     Are you in a position not to?

     SHEPPARD
     Oh...I've got you right where I want you.

     MICHAEL
     I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer...and yet I very much
     want to continue living. If you want to survive as I do, then I
     suggest you tell me where you are.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship. You still
     want to help?

     MICHAEL
     Targeting the ventral hyperdrive generators would be most effective.

     SHEPPARD

     (confused)
     Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

     MICHAEL
     Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [An array of familiar IOA officials sit opposite Weir.]

     WEIR
     The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we
     were under a time constraint. To speed up the problem solving, we
     distributed the file--

     SHEN
     And played right into their hands.

     WEIR
     Yes.

     WOOLSEY
     In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took
     along the way.

     SHEN
     And we supported her recommendations, I know... but clearly, we were
     not in possession of all of the facts.

     WEIR
     Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.

     WOOLSEY
     So, what measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching
     Earth?

     WEIR
     I was coordinating a strike against the hive ships when you recalled
     me.

     BRITISH IOA REP
     With what?

     WEIR
     With everything we've got.

     SHEN
     Is that wise?

     WEIR
     General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources
     committed to fighting the Ori, the weapons platform in Antarctica,
     powered by a pair of Mark II generators, would be Earth's only
     defense. Now, I believe it would be far better to stop them while
     they're still within reach of Atlantis.

     WOOLSEY
     Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on
     the Daedalus ensuring successful operation of the Antarctic weapons
     platform when the Wraith arrive?

     WEIR
     The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle. A long
     journey at full power was out of the question. And there is no way
     of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.

     SHEN
     You would risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to
     undo your mistake?

     WEIR
     Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
     There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard. But either plan will
     require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.

     BRITISH IOA REP
     Then if you'll excuse us...we need some time to discuss our options.

     WEIR
     I have instructed Atlantis to...to contact the SGC when both
     Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave. If you would like to overturn
     my standing orders at that time, go right ahead. But you will have
     to fire me first.

   [Angry, she stands and leaves.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Hives hold their stations.]

   INT--WRAITH HIVE SHIP POD SECTION

   [Ronon seems to be trying to cut through the webbing.]

     MCKAY
     I wonder what they'll do to us. Feed on us, probably. I mean,
     that's... That's what they do.

     RONON
     It's not going to come to that.

     MCKAY
     Maybe. Earth'll probably mount some kind of defense, in which case,
     I imagine death would be instantaneous. Unless we're trapped on a
     deck with a fire or something. Then we'd be burned alive. Well,
     burned alive or suffocate. I wonder which would be worse, being
     life-sucked by the Wraith or burned alive. I honestly couldn't
     consider two worse options.

     RONON
     Stop talking.

     MCKAY
     Okay, you know what? Make me.

   [Ronon begins cutting at the webbing with a knife.]

     MCKAY
     What are you doing? Where did you get that?

     RONON
     I was trying to get my hands free so I could get to it.

     MCKAY
     Would it have killed you to tell me?

   [Ronon breaks free of the pod and steps out of it.]

     RONON
     Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.

     MCKAY
     What? Don't just stand there. Cut me loose.

     RONON

     Only if you put an end to all this "we're going to die, there's no
     hope"
     talk.

     MCKAY
     Well, now there is hope!

     RONON
     Ready.

     MCKAY
     No!

   [Ronon cuts Rodney out of his pod.]

     MCKAY
     God, a little help, please? Oh, it's freezing out here!

     RONON
     Would you prefer to go back in?

     MCKAY
     No.

     RONON
     So now what?

     MCKAY
     What?

     RONON
     How do we get out of here?

     MCKAY
     Well, I don't...

     RONON
     What?

     MCKAY
     You said no more death talk.

     RONON
     McKay...

     MCKAY
     Look, fine, we're out of the cocoons. So what? We're still stuck on
     the ship, and there's no way off it without... Well, in any
     survivable way.

     RONON
     You'll think of something.

     MCKAY
     It's not a question of thinking.

     RONON
     You'll think of something.

   [McKay pulls at the tendrils still attached to him.]

     MCKAY
     Fine. Can we at least go somewhere else? Can you get this off me?
     It's down my back. It's down my back.

     RONON
     Just...

   [They head away from the pods.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Weir is there with Harriman. Woolsey arrives.]

     WEIR
     So, what do they want to do?

     WOOLSEY
     They're still arguing about it.

     WEIR
     Of course they are.

     HARRIMAN
     Incoming wormhole.

     This is Atlantis. We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.

     HARRIMAN
     Stand by, Atlantis.

   [Weir looks to Woolsey.]

     WOOLSEY
     They haven't reached a decision.

     WEIR
     And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey, because if they agree or
     disagree with me, then they have to take some sort of
     responsibility. No, they'd rather have someone to blame. I give this
     order, either way, they have a scapegoat if something goes wrong.
     It's all part of the game.

     Ma'am?

   [Kleinman has joined Caldwell as he walks.]

     CALDWELL
     I want all operable missile tubes loaded with Mark III tactical
     warheads.

     KLEINMAN
     That'll be every one of our nukes, sir.

     CALDWELL
     I'm well aware of that. Secondly, I want to disable all firing
     safeties to enable the launch of every one of our missiles the
     moment we exit hyperspace.

     KLEINMAN
     I'm not even sure that's possible.

     CALDWELL
     Make it possible, please.

     Zelenka says she'll fly, sir, but as of right now, that's about all
     she can do.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL
     You'll have thirteen hours en route to get your weapons and shields
     online, but we need to leave right now to make this window. Are you

     SHEPPARD
     Thanks. It'll be a walk in the park. A very scary park, filled with
     monsters who are trying to kill me.

     MICHAEL
     I don't understand.

     SHEPPARD
     Never mind.

     I already knew that.

     WOOLSEY
     The ambassadors have finished convening.

     WEIR
     Oh, good timing.

     WOOLSEY
     Uh, yes. They'd like to continue debriefing you now.

     WEIR
     Yeah, I bet they would.

     WOOLSEY
     Excuse me?

     WEIR
     No. I'm not going to sit there and have them rake me over the coals
     about every decision I've made these past two years that they don't
     agree with in hindsight.

     WOOLSEY
     Dr. Weir, you know I have the greatest respect for you, but as far
     as the I.O.A. is concerned, you're not exactly the employee of the
     month right now.

     WEIR
     If the Wraith make it to Earth, then keeping my job will be the
     least of my concerns.

     WOOLSEY
     And if your plan succeeds?

     WEIR
     Then I expect to keep my job, yes, because I did what they,
     apparently, are incapable of doing. I made a decision. The fact is,
     at this point there really is nothing more we can do but wait and
     see what happens. But give them my best.

     to eat something.

     RONON
     I think I have a plan.

     MCKAY
     You? Really?

     RONON
     You know a lot about these ships, right?

     MCKAY
     Oh, maybe. Why?

     RONON
     If I can get you to a control panel, how much damage could you do?

     MCKAY
     What do you mean?

     RONON
     Could you overload the engines and blow up the ship?

     MCKAY
     How is that an escape plan?

     RONON
     I never said it was an escape plan.

     MCKAY

     (incensed)
     How is it a plan?

     RONON
     You're the one who says there's no way out of this. If we're already
     dead, I say we take them with us.

     MCKAY

     (resigned)
     I suppose I'd rather die as a hero than as a meal.

     RONON
     So you can do it?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, probably.

     RONON
     Now you're talking.

   [The move off.]

     You should not be here.

     MICHAEL
     She asked me to question the prisoner...If you'd prefer to discuss
     it with her...

     WRAITH
     Release him.

   [The soldiers push Sheppard to Michael. He walks on his own, touching a
   wound on his face.]

     MICHAEL
     I will take him from here.

   [Michael and Sheppard walk away together. Michael lowers the gun he'd
   been holding on Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD
     You had me worried there.

     MICHAEL
     You've slowed them down at least for a little while. We need to get
     to a transport ship and hope your friends find us.

     SHEPPARD
     Not 'til we free Ronon and McKay.

     We're headed toward them now.

     MICHAEL
     One of your ships has launched an attack. Their first strike
     inflicted serious damage on this hive.

     SHEPPARD
     Good.

     MICHAEL
     The other hive was undamaged, but your vessel is continuing to
     engage.

     SHEPPARD
     Are you going to go through the whole play-by-play, or are we going
     to get out of here?

     MICHAEL
     This way.

   INT--WRAITH HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

     RONON
     Doesn't matter.

     MCKAY
     Well, it matters to us.

     RONON
     Why?

     MCKAY
     Because if it's our guys, then our chances of survival just went
     back above zero, albeit fractionally.

     RONON
     If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help
     them win the battle. Now, move it.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KLEINMAN
     One missile got through, sir. One of the Wraith ships suffered
     serious damage, but the other one is-- Sir, the Orion has arrived.
     The other hive is moving to intercept.

     CALDWELL
     They launched their weapons?

     KLEINMAN
     Negative, sir.

     Yes, sir, I see that.

   INT--ORION BRIDGE

     LORNE
     Stand by. Doc, you're killing us, here.

     ZELENKA
     Okay. I have it. I have it. I have it.

     LORNE
     Firing drones!

   EXT--SPACE

   fire itself. The drones evade the Darts and make their way to one of
   the Hives, where they inflict such heavy damage that it explodes.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KLEINMAN
     Sir, the remaining hive is shifting their attack to the Orion.

     CALDWELL
     Move to intercept.

     MICHAEL
     I'm sorry. They must have been taken for feeding.

     SHEPPARD
     No, no. These were cut from the inside. They escaped.

     MICHAEL
     They could be anywhere on this ship.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's a start.

     MICHAEL
     Why? What could their objective possibly be?

     SHEPPARD
     If I know Ronon, they're somewhere where they can do as much damage
     as they can, and McKay would know where and how to do that, so...

     MICHAEL
     There's a control station this way.

   directed at Orion.]

     We need to abandon ship!

   [He starts to leave the bridge.]

     LORNE
     Hey, Doc! Listen to me!

     ZELENKA
     We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo. This ship
     is going to blow any moment, Major.

     Colonel Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our
     end.

     Trust me, that was hilarious.

     RONON
     Have you done it yet?

     MCKAY
     Look, this ship has been seriously damaged. It's hard for me to find
     something to overload.

     SHEPPARD
     Let Mikey try it.

   [The two pairs see each other. Ronon whips out a knife and points it at
   Michael.]

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's helping us.

     MCKAY
     Where did you come from?

     SHEPPARD
     I managed to latch on to the hull of the hive before it went into
     hyperspace.

     RONON
     Nice move.

     SHEPPARD
     Saw it in a movie once.

   [The ship shudders under attack.]

     SHEPPARD
     We've got to get to the Daedalus.

     MCKAY
     The Daedalus--the Daedalus is here?

     MICHAEL
     First we need to get to the transport.

     RONON
     Why should I trust you?

     MICHAEL
     Because I'm trusting you.

   [Michael hands his weapon to Ronon then steps away. Ronon points the
   weapon at Michael. Sheppard grabs his arm.]

     SHEPPARD
     Because I said so.

   [They move off. Ronon grabs Sheppard so that Michael can't hear them.
   Rodney stands with them.]

     RONON
     I don't like this.

     SHEPPARD
     You got a better idea?

     RONON
     We take the ship on our own and leave him here.

     SHEPPARD
     He's the reason I'm alive right now.

     MCKAY

     Besides, I don't think that's even possible. It took me days to
     crack the
     Wraith dart interface, and this ship is a whole lot bigger.

     RONON
     I don't like it.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I get it, you hate the Wraith.

     RONON
     Him in particular.

     SHEPPARD

     (to McKay)
     Is there anything you can do to boost the radio signal? I want to
     reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.

     MCKAY
     Well, I could try.

     MICHAEL
     Hang on. They'll most likely open fire on us the second we leave the
     bay.

     MCKAY
     Oh, great. The day just gets better and better.

     Sorry, sir. We did our best.

     CALDWELL

     Nothing to apologize for, Major.
     (to Kleinman)
     Bring all rail guns to bear on the main Dart bays. Hold fire till I
     give the order. Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield
     until then.

     KLEINMAN
     I have a contact, sir. A single Wraith ship, possibly a transport,
     just left the hive and is on a course for us. It's broadcasting a
     comm on our frequencies.

     CALDWELL
     What the hell do they want?

     ZELENKA
     Maybe they want to surrender.

     CALDWELL
     Not likely. Let's hear it.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     This is Colonel John Sheppard, authentication code Alpha Seven Tango
     Three. Please respond.

     CALDWELL
     Open a channel. Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.

     SHEPPARD
     Don't get all emotional on me now. Look, I've got McKay, Ronon, and
     Michael aboard a Wraith transport.

     CALDWELL
     Michael?

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir, and he's got a plan I think you're gonna like. But it
     probably won't be long before they start shooting at us.

     KLEINMAN
     The hive just opened fire on the transport, sir.

     CALDWELL
     Beam them directly to the bridge.

   [Sheppard, McKay, Ronon, and Michael beam in. Sheppard turns to
   Caldwell.]

     SHEPPARD
     Colonel!

     CALDWELL
     Colonel. You said something about a plan?

     MICHAEL
     I've disabled their jamming code, but it's only a matter of time
     before they realize.

     SHEPPARD
     All you have to do is send over a nuke.

     CALDWELL
     We deployed all our warheads in the first attack.

     KLEINMAN
     The hive is launching darts, sir.

     CALDWELL
     Open up on those bays, all batteries!

   EXT--SPACE

   [The two ships fire on each other furiously. The Wraith Hive is hit on
   its broadsides, and the repeated hits being to damage it, causing
   explosions. Daedalus approaches while firing. It takes severe hits on
   its underside.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The ship takes major damage. The gunner is thrown from his seat. A
   fire starts behind Caldwell. Sheppard takes over the weapons position.
   McKay rushes to the back.]

     CALDWELL
     Cap that off! Report!

     KLEINMAN
     The plan worked, sir. The concentrated fire on the bays created a
     number of secondary explosions. They've stopped firing.

     SHEPPARD
     Nice work, Colonel.

     CALDWELL
     Fortunately a draw is a win for our side. Ship's status?

     DAEDALUS
     Shields completely depleted, and we're venting atmosphere.

     CALDWELL
     Seal off all affected decks.

     DAEDALUS
     Yes, sir, but that last blast took out our life support, and the
     back-ups aren't responding. As of right now, we're
     shallow-breathing.

     RONON
     Meaning?

     MCKAY
     Meaning that in a little under nine hours, we're all going to
     suffocate.

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

   [Zelenka and McKay walk with Kleinman.]

     ZELENKA
     As l--As long as we don't have to worry about shields and weapons,
     we may be able to cannibalize parts from some of our other systems,
     in order to create, at the very least, a-a CO2 filtration system.

     MCKAY
     By the time we got something like that up and running, the CO2
     levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we'd be able to
     concoct.

     ZELENKA
     But, it's worth a try.

     MCKAY
     Yes, yeah, but regardless, we need more electricians and welders
     than are technically certified on the ship's roster. Anyone, and I
     mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.

     KLEINMAN
     There are teams assembling on every deck.

     MCKAY
     Good, good.

   [The arrive at a supply room and see sets of personal survival
   packs.</blockquote>

     MCKAY
     Ah, now we're talking. How many more of these do we have?

     KLEINMAN
     Twenty in total.

     MCKAY
     How many people on board?

     KLEINMAN
     In and around the two hundred mark.

     MCKAY
     Oh, so, I guess buddy-breathing our way through this one's out of
     the question.

     KLEINMAN
     I'm afraid so, sir, yes.

     MCKAY
     Okay, fine they're reserved for people working on getting
     life-support systems operational. We need those people as
     clear-headed as possible.

     KLEINMAN
     And by "those people"...

     MCKAY
     Yes, I will be one of them.

     ZELENKA
     How many levels are inaccessible?

     KLEINMAN
     Seven.

     ZELENKA
     Okay, we need to find out if there are any pockets of breathable
     atmosphere in there. We may be able to squeeze another hour or so
     out of regions that have been sealed off.

     MCKAY
     We can't exactly transfer the Oh-two where we need it.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but we could be--

     MCKAY
     We will be able to access key panels that have been closed off to
     us. Let's get Sheppard in a 302. He can eyeball it from the outside.
     I'll take this.

     We are floating between two galaxies, Radek. Atlantis has no ship to
     send, and even if we were somehow able to repair the array and get a
     message back to Earth, it would still take them weeks to get a
     rescue here.

     ZELENKA
     I wasn't thinking of rescue. I was thinking simply of telling them
     that we've stopped the Wraith, and perhaps letting someone know the
     sacrifice that we've done.

     MCKAY

     Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last
     breath of air to getting more air.
     (inspired)
     Wait a second.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIEFING ROOM

   [McKay speaks to Caldwell, Michael and Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     The only breathable air within light years is on the Wraith ship.

     CALDWELL
     There're also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.

     SHEPPARD
     So we take them. Beam an assault team in.

     MICHAEL
     You would be far out-numbered.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we're dead here. I'll take my chances.

     MICHAEL
     I admire your courage, Colonel, but you would be dead there as
     surely as here... Unless we send over the gas.

     MCKAY
     Yes, yes, yes. That could work.

     MICHAEL
     The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.

     SHEPPARD
     Do we still have it on board?

     CALDWELL
     Yes, we do. And now that Michael's disabled their jamming codes...

     MCKAY
     We finish the plan we started.

     SHEPPARD
     We beam over the gas and wait. We wait long enough, they won't even
     want to put up a fight.

     MCKAY
     Because they'll be humans with no memories. I can't believe I might
     actually survive this.

     CALDWELL
     We're almost out of breathable air now, and the retrovirus takes a
     minimum ten hours to run its course.

     SHEPPARD

     Yeah, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the 302s. (to Michael)
     If this works, can you fly the hive ship?

     MICHAEL
     I could.

     SHEPPARD
     What do you say, Colonel?

     CALDWELL

     (into radio)
     Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.

     WEAPONS
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, NIGHT

   INT--SGC VISITORS' OFFICE

   [Landry knocks on the doorway of Weir's SGC office. The door is open.]

     WEIR

     (concerned)
     Anything?

     LANDRY
     No. No contacts yet. Our tests of the Mark Two generator and the
     chair in Antarctica are promising.

     WEIR
     "Promising." That doesn't sound very promising.

     LANDRY
     Yeah, we're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of
     the hive ships, but doing so will probably require the last of our
     drones, and there goes our secret weapon. We'd really rather not
     have to do that. How'd it go with the I.O.A.?

     WEIR
     Oh, you know. I mean does anyone ever come out of an I.O.A.
     deposition saying, "That went well"?

     LANDRY
     No, I don't suppose they do.

     WEIR
     It was what it was.

     LANDRY
     Well, at least most of the time you're a galaxy away. That Woolsey
     guy is here almost every other week.

   [Landry sits across from Weird.]

     WEIR
     I think they're going to ask me to step down.

     LANDRY
     Well, if they're just going to ask, you can always say no.

     WEIR
     I messed this one up, General.

     LANDRY
     Yeah, you did.

     WEIR
     And I lost some of the best people I've ever--

     LANDRY
     But you proceeded with the blessing of the I.O.A and Stargate
     Command, as I recall.

     WEIR
     Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.

     LANDRY
     "Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It's the courage to
     continue that counts." And I think you've got that in spades.

     WEIR
     Churchill?

     LANDRY
     Yeah except for that last part about you. That was all me. Get some
     sleep, Elizabeth.

     WEIR
     Yes, sir.

   [Landry leaves, and Weir contemplates his words.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus moves slowly around the Wraith ship, the Milky Way visible
   behind it.]

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIDGE

   [Crewmen sit on the floor as those with survival breathing packs work
   on the ship. McKay is one of those working. Sweating, he walks slowly
   on the bridge.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     KLEINMAN

     (weakly)
     Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.

     CALDWELL

     (weakly)
     The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.

   [Sheppard and a team of marines sit behind Caldwell. They stand.]

     SHEPPARD
     We don't have much of a choice. We've got to go now.

   [They leave the bridge, Ronon assisting McKay.]

   INT--WRAITH HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [The team beams aboard. The move out and find many Wraith now turned
   human, lying on the floor. One gasps. Sheppard looks on over.]

     SHEPPARD
     Some of them are dead.

     LORNE
     Looks like they killed each other.

     WRAITH TURNED HUMAN
     What's happened?

   [Sheppard and the others turn their weapons on the man for a moment.]

     SHEPPARD

     It's all right.
     (to a marine)
     Find a holding area. Start marshaling the survivors there.

     MCKAY
     The queen's chamber should be that way.

   INT--QUEEN'S CHAMBER ON HIVE SHIP

   [They arrive cautiously. The Queen struggles on her throne, her face
   hidden.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hello? You all right?

   [Lorne goes to her aid.]

     LORNE
     It's okay. You're going to be all right now.

   [The Queen, still a Wraith, grabs Lorne at the throat and lifts him off
   the deck. She yells and prepares to feed on him. McKay and the others
   shoot her, and she drops Lorne on the stairs.]

     LORNE
     It didn't work on her.

     MCKAY
     Oh. Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.

     LORNE

     Yeah. Something you might have mentioned before she almost killed
     me,
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     I only thought of it now.

     MARINE

     (over radio)
     Colonel Sheppard, so far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.

     SHEPPARD

     Understood.
     (into radio)
     Sheppard to Daedalus.

     CALDWELL

     (over radio)
     Go ahead.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     You can start sending people over, sir. They're all human, and the
     air is good. I think we're out of the woods.

   TO BE CONTINUED

   FADE OUT
