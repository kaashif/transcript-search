   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Banks is at her station. Woolsey and Sheppard are nearby. The Stargate
   activates.]

     BANKS
     Incoming wormhole. Signal's coming in now.

   [They look on a monitor to see a video transmission of the Wraith known
   as Todd standing outdoors on a planet.]

     SHEPPARD

     (taken aback)
     Todd.

     TODD

     (on video)
     No doubt you're surprised to see me, John Sheppard.

   [Sheppard glances back at Woolsey for a moment.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you weren't looking so good last time I saw you.

     TODD
     Yes. Well, you'll be pleased to know the treatment was
     successful--although excruciatingly painful.

     SHEPPARD
     You're just saying that to make me feel good.

     TODD

     (chuckling)
     I was able to return to my position as leader of the alliance,
     although...I have had a recent setback. Perhaps you can see what is
     remaining of my shuttle behind me?

   [Todd steps back and in the distance the remains of a crashed Wraith
   ship lie in the desert.]

     SHEPPARD

     (sarcastic)
     Yeah, nice landing.

     TODD
     Don't be so critical, Sheppard. It wasn't long ago my flying skills
     saved the lives of both you and your companions. It wasn't pilot
     error. I was attacked...by one of my underlings.

     WOOLSEY
     You'll excuse me for being blunt, but why should we care?

     TODD
     It isn't the fact that he attacked and at least temporarily defeated
     me that should concern you. It is rather...how he managed to do it.

     WOOLSEY
     And how was that?

     TODD
     Well, he acquired a rare and powerful piece of technology-- one with
     which I believe you are quite familiar...

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [Woolsey and Sheppard's team congregate in McKay's lab.]

     MCKAY
     A ZPM? Are you kidding me?

     SHEPPARD
     Eh, that's what he said.

     RONON
     I don't buy it.

     WOOLSEY
     Why not?

     MCKAY
     Well, for one thing, they don't exactly grow on trees.

     RONON
     He got betrayed by one of his own people. Now he wants us to help
     him clean up the mess. End of story.

     TEYLA
     It is possible that he mentioned the zero point module simply to get
     our attention.

     WOOLSEY
     Except he would also have to know that sooner or later we would
     discover the truth, and in the meantime, he's volunteered to place
     himself in our custody. Not a very good plan.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you can bet there's something he's not telling us.

     WOOLSEY
     Granted. But that doesn't necessarily mean that he's lying about the
     ZPM.

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     If this true, it could be very, very bad. I mean, inefficient power
     generation is the Achilles heel of Wraith technology. It's basically
     the reason for every technological advantage we have. If
     this...underling, or whatever it is that Todd calls him, is flying
     around in a ZPM powered hiveship, then...

     WOOLSEY
     It's a threat we can't tolerate. And we won't.

   [He nods to Sheppard, who sighs and exchanges concerned looks with
   McKay.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Woolsey enters the room. Todd already sits at a table, his hands
   resting on top of it.]

     WOOLSEY
     Well...here we are again.

     TODD
     Indeed. The city has become quite familiar to me...almost a respite
     from daily life. It would be a shame to see it destroyed.

     WOOLSEY
     Are you suggesting that if we don't help you, that would be a likely
     outcome?

   [Todd shrugs. Woolsey sits at the table across from him.]

     WOOLSEY
     All right. Let's start at the beginning. Where did the ZPM come
     from?

     TODD
     You recall I managed to acquire a few of the devices from the
     Replicator city before it was destroyed?

     WOOLSEY
     Yes, and they were lost when Colonel Sheppard took out the cloning
     facility.

     TODD
     Not all of them. I may have acquired a few more than I let on.

     WOOLSEY

     (shrewdly)
     How many more?

     TODD
     Let's not get caught up in unnecessary details.

     WOOLSEY

     (firmly)
     I like details.

     TODD
     Even if I gave you a number, you'd have no way of verifying it. So
     what's the point?

     WOOLSEY
     All right, then tell me this. Why now? You've had those ZPMs for
     over a year.

     TODD
     The organic nature of the hive creates certain incompatibilities
     with Ancient technology. I put my best scientists to work on this
     project, and recently one of them succeeded.

     WOOLSEY
     Only he didn't want to turn it over to you. He decided he wanted to
     keep it for himself. And now you want us to help you kick him to the
     curb.

     TODD

     (becoming serious and intense)
     What you really need to know is that this hive is a work in
     progress. It has yet to reach its full potential, which means if you
     attack it now, you may be able to destroy it. But if you hesitate,
     it will be too late, and this hive will be unstoppable.

   [Woolsey grinds his jaw.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIG

   [Todd sits on a cot. He is wearing a plain grey coverall. Sheppard
   enters. There are guards outside.]

     TODD
     Colonel.

     SHEPPARD
     Looking good.

     TODD
     Was it really necessary to remove my subspace transmitter and force
     me to wear this ridiculous outfit?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, after what happened last time on this ship, you can't blame
     us.

     TODD
     I take it that my request to be on the bridge when we make contact--

     SHEPPARD

     (interrupting)
     Denied.

     TODD

     (nodding)
     Understandable.

     SHEPPARD
     Here's the problem. Every time we get involved with you, I feel like
     I'm walking around with a live grenade in my pocket, just waiting
     for it to all go wrong--for that one "thing" you forgot to mention.

     TODD
     I assure you, in this case--

     SHEPPARD

     (cutting him off)
     Save it. Been down this road before.

   [He starts to leave.]

     TODD
     If you really feel that way, why would you let me go after our last
     encounter?

     SHEPPARD
     We had a deal, and you kept up your end of the bargain. And to be
     honest, I didn't think you'd live.

     TODD

     (understanding)
     Ahh.

     SHEPPARD

     (quietly serious)
     If I find out you're playing us, I'm not gonna wait for
     authorization. There isn't gonna be any paperwork. I'm just gonna
     kill you.

   [Sheppard turns and leaves as Todd watches, intrigued.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Sheppard's team is geared up for an away mission as the members enter
   the bridge and approach Caldwell.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's the status, Colonel?

     CALDWELL
     We're approaching the coordinates. You going somewhere?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Drop us out early before we get into sensor range. We'll check
     it out in the jumper.

     CALDWELL
     That's not the plan.

     MCKAY
     We can go in cloaked. Stay in touch through subspace on a secure
     channel.

     SHEPPARD
     If it's what Todd says it is, you can come in guns blazing.

     CALDWELL
     All right. Just be careful.

   [Sheppard's team leaves.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The puddle jumper flies through space.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard's team is inside. McKay studies readings on the cockpit
   displays.]

     MCKAY
     Almost in range.

     SHEPPARD
     Engaging cloak.

   [Sheppard touches some controls, and the cloak engages.]

     MCKAY
     All right, getting readings now. It's a hive, all right. Hmm.

     RONON
     What?

     MCKAY
     I'm reading...a higher than normal energy output. I mean,
     significantly higher.

     TEYLA
     Consistent with the ZPM?

     MCKAY
     Well, it's hard to say from this far out.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL

     (into radio)
     Sheppard, what's your status?

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     McKay's getting some interesting readings, so we're going in for a
     closer look.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The hive ship is visible through the jumper window.]

     MCKAY
     I'm detecting massive energy output.

     SHEPPARD
     What's happening?

     MCKAY

     (disturbed)
     It's growing.

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you talking about?

     MCKAY
     That's what they're doing with the surplus energy--using it to grow
     a larger, and if I'm reading this correctly, significantly denser
     outer hull. It makes sense. Normal hives have a limit of growth. I
     mean, any bigger or heavier and they become impossible to maneuver,
     let alone get into hyperspace. I mean, you make a simple left turn,
     and you're torn apart by your own inertia. But with a ZPM...

     SHEPPARD
     I get the picture. What does that mean for us?

     MCKAY
     When they're done, my guess is that hull will be all but
     impenetrable.

   [The team look worried.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Well, we better take 'em out of the picture before they
     get that far.

   [A sensor beeps rapidly.]

     MCKAY
     Hold on. They're...powering weapons.

     RONON
     They can't see us, right?

     MCKAY
     Of course not. They must just be running a test...

   [An energy pulse heads straight for them, passing directly overhead,
   shaking the jumper. Everyone's eyes widen.]

     MCKAY
     Holy crap!

     SHEPPARD
     Well, what are the odds of them randomly firing a test shot directly
     at us!

     MCKAY
     I would say--given the enormity of empty space all around
     us--nonexistent?

     SHEPPARD

     (low)
     They can see us.

   [Sheppard steers the jumper away from the hive ship.]

     MCKAY
     They must've figured out a way to increase the sensitivity of their
     scanners.

   [Another blast is a near-miss, rattling the jumper.]

     MCKAY

     (caustic)
     Let me guess, something to do with the ZPM?

     MCKAY
     Probably.

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Daedalus, we've got a problem. Our cloak's ineffective.

     CALDWELL

     (into radio)
     We're on our way.
     (to port helmsman)
     Take us in maximum sublight.
     (to Marks)
     Shields up.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus flies forward.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Another blast hits too close.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm dropping the cloak. It ain't doing us any good.

     MCKAY
     Not to mention you could fire back.

     SHEPPARD

     (admonishing)
     One thing at a time, Rodney.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper moves evasively and dodges several pulse blasts. It gets
   struck in one of its nacelles and starts spinning out of control around
   its longitudinal axis.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     We're hit!

     SHEPPARD
     I've lost controls!

   [McKay jumps up and heads towards the rear compartment.]

     MCKAY
     I'll work out a bypass. Give me a minute.

     SHEPPARD
     They get a bead on us, Rodney, we're dead!

   [McKay opens a panel and starts working with the crystals.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper continues to spin out of control as it gets close to
   Daedalus. Another pulse barely misses it. Further blasts are deflected
   by the Daedalus shields as it flies into the path of fire.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     MARKS
     It worked, sir. We've blocked the shot. Shield is holding.

     CALDWELL
     All right, now return fire. Main battery, full power.

     MARKS
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus fires back at the hive ship.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Direct hit.

     CALDWELL
     Damage?

     MARKS

     (surprised)
     Minimal.

     CALDWELL
     Ready missiles. We're gonna throw everything we have at this guy.

     MARKS
     Sir, I'm reading a massive energy buildup.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship sends out a large series of pulse blasts from every
   weapons port along its flank. All are directed at Daedalus.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

     CALDWELL
     Brace for impact!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Several of the pulses strike the Daedalus, battering the shield at the
   bow.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [Sparks fly as the ship takes damage.]

     MARKS
     Shields are down! Heavy damage on all decks! We've lost hyperdrive
     and main weapons.

     CALDWELL
     Evasive maneuvers! We can't take another hit like that!

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [McKay stops working on the ceiling control panel.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, you should have flight controls now!

   [Sheppard begins to move the craft.]

     SHEPPARD
     What about weapons?

     MCKAY
     Not a chance!

   [Teyla has been watching the window.]

     TEYLA
     Something's happening.

   [McKay steps forward as they all lean to look.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive passes the Daedalus and jumps into hyperspace.]

   INT--DAEDALUS GEAR UP ROOM

   [Caldwell meets with Sheppard's team as they take off their tactical
   equipment. Outside, work teams try and repair damage to the ship.]

     CALDWELL
     You know, it doesn't make any sense. Most of our main systems were
     down. These guys had us dead to rights, and they knew it. Why would
     they just fly away?

     TEYLA
     Perhaps it's precisely because they knew we were no longer a threat.

     CALDWELL
     But it's not like the Wraith to be so charitable.

     MCKAY
     Todd said the ship isn't finished, right? They haven't adapted the
     full potential of the ZPM. Well, maybe the battle maxed them out.

     CALDWELL
     Well, if that's the case, I'd hate to meet up with them when they do
     finish it.

   [Sheppard finishes unloading his pistol and sets it on the gear table.]

     SHEPPARD
     We need to get back to Atlantis. What's the prognosis on the
     hyperdrive?

     CALDWELL
     Uh, the control systems are completely shot. My guys are working on
     a patch, but it could be days, even weeks before we're back online.
     For the moment, we're not going anywhere.

   [Marks enters.]

     MARKS

     (to Caldwell)
     Sir.

     CALDWELL
     What is it, Marks?

     MARKS
     I think we may have something.

   [Marks leads the way out of the room. Caldwell and Sheppard's team
   follow.]

   INT--DAEDALUS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM

   [Kavanaugh is amongst the crew working in the room. Caldwell and
   Sheppard's team enter and surround his station. He glances back, spots
   McKay, rolls his eyes and turns back to work.]

     MCKAY
     Kavanaugh? What the hell are you doing here?

     KAVANAUGH

     (sarcastic)
     Reassignment. More fun and adventure in the Pegasus Galaxy.

     CALDWELL

     (irritated)
     Show us what you got, please?

   [Kavanaugh moves to another station. They follow.]

     KAVANAUGH
     It's a subspace signal. We detected it just before the hive jumped
     into hyperspace. It was weak. Luckily, I happened to be monitoring
     the sensor, or we might not have picked it up at all.

     MCKAY

     (studying the readout)
     It's Wraith code.

     KAVANAUGH

     (irked)
     Obviously. We're having trouble deciphering it because the message
     is interlaced with a residual radiation, and I've never seen it
     before.

     MCKAY
     I have. Once, when we met another me, and once when we encountered
     another Daedalus. This signal was sent from another reality.

     CALDWELL
     Uh, I'm sorry. What the hell are you talking about?

     MCKAY
     Some Wraith, somewhere, in another reality sent a coded signal--only
     whatever means they used to access subspace created a rift, allowing
     the signal to cross into multiple realities, including our own.

     RONON
     So what does it say?

     MCKAY
     Oh, just give me a second.

   [He leans across Kavanaugh's station and starts typing. He pulls up a
   new readout.]

     MCKAY

     (sighing in despair)
     Oh, great.

     SHEPPARD
     What is it?

     MCKAY
     It's a set of coordinates.

     CALDWELL
     Coordinates to what?

     MCKAY
     Earth.

   [They exchange worried looks.]

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

   [McKay, Sheppard, and Caldwell move through a corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     You think the hive picked up the signal?

     MCKAY
     Why else would they leave like that? It can't be a coincidence. The
     Wraith know that Earth is a much richer feeding ground than anything
     in the Pegasus Galaxy, and they've been looking for those
     coordinates for years.

     CALDWELL
     All right. As soon as communications are back up, we'll contact
     Atlantis, have them relay a message to Stargate Command.

     MCKAY
     Wait a minute. I've got an idea. How many ships do we have
     available?

     CALDWELL
     Aside from ourselves, there's the Apollo and the Sun Tzu.

     SHEPPARD
     How about the Odyssey?

     CALDWELL
     Mmm, it's on some secret mission even I'm not supposed to know
     about.

     MCKAY
     Then two will have to be enough.

     SHEPPARD
     What are you suggesting?

     MCKAY
     Look, that hive may be super-powerful and all, but I'll bet it has
     to drop out of hyperspace at some point along the way for hull
     regeneration. I can use the sensor data from the jumpers to
     extrapolate exactly where that'll be.

     CALDWELL

     (skeptical)
     Sounds pretty risky. If you're wrong, it--

     MCKAY

     (interrupting)
     I won't be! Anyways, we can't wait until they get all the way to
     Earth. My guess is by that point, they'll be fully adapted to the
     ZPM.

   [Caldwell nods.]

     CALDWELL
     Do it.

   [McKay leaves.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Chuck is at his usual station. Woolsey works with another technician
   nearby.]

     CHUCK
     Sir? The Daedalus just dropped out of hyperspace.

     WOOLSEY
     It's about time.

     CHUCK
     Colonel Sheppard and his team are beaming down.

   [Sheppard's team beams directly into the control room.]

     WOOLSEY
     Colonel. It's good to finally have you all back.

     SHEPPARD
     What'd we miss?

     WOOLSEY
     Well the good news is, there's no indication of any other Wraith
     ships heading for the Milky Way.

     MCKAY
     That's as I figured. That signal was too short and too weak. That
     ship only detected it because of its obvious improvements to the
     sensors.

     SHEPPARD
     All right. What's the bad news?

     WOOLSEY

     (to Chuck)
     Show them.

   [Chuck types on his keyboard, and a video of Ellis on board the Apollo
   appears on the screen. There are signs of ship damage behind him.]

     WOOLSEY
     This is part of a subspace message sent by Colonel Ellis on board
     the Apollo.

     ELLIS

     (staticy, on video)
     We've engaged the hive, unfortunately, without much success. The Sun
     Tzu was crippled, and she's venting atmosphere. We're in the process
     of taking on her crew now. But unfortunately, with my engines down,
     I won't be able to get to the nearest Stargate for at least a month.
     As for the enemy, all indications are that they received very little
     damage and are continuing on their previous course.

   [As Ellis has been speaking, McKay and Sheppard exchange worried
   looks.]

     WOOLSEY
     With those two ships out of the picture, nothing stands between that
     hive...and Earth.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard heads down a corridor. McKay runs into him as he turns a
   corner.]

     MCKAY

     (excited)
     There you are! Look, I've been thinking...

     SHEPPARD
     So have I.

     MCKAY
     There is another ship that can help defend Earth.

     SHEPPARD
     I know. We're standing on it.

     MCKAY
     The city...exactly! The only problem is...

     SHEPPARD
     ZPMs.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, but if we want to get there in time to make a difference, we
     need a full complement.

     SHEPPARD
     Where do you think I'm headed, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Right.

   [McKay stops short in surprise and lets Sheppard continue without him.
   McKay heads back the way he came.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Todd sits at the table, still in the coverall. Sheppard enters and
   leans across the table.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, things didn't go exactly according to plan.

     TODD
     So I heard. You intend to hold me responsible?

     SHEPPARD
     All I know is that everything went sideways--the way it always does
     when you're involved. You mean to tell me that's a coincidence?

   [Todd leans in, his hands bracing the table.]

     TODD
     Then you've come to make good on your threat?

   [Sheppard sits in the chair opposite Todd and folds his hands, never
   breaking eye contact with the Wraith.]

     SHEPPARD
     The other ZPMs you talked to Woolsey about? Tell us where to get
     'em, and maybe it'll improve your situation.

     TODD
     Am I supposed to be enticed by this offer?

     SHEPPARD
     No. I'll probably kill you anyway. But, don't forget, this Wraith
     betrayed you and got away with it. For no other reason, you might
     want to do it out of pure spite.

   [Todd leans back, studying Sheppard.]

     TODD
     You...know how to talk to me, John Sheppard.

   [Todd laughs.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Woolsey and Sheppard wait by the active Stargate. Lorne's team exits
   the wormhole. Lorne carries a black case.]

     LORNE
     We got 'em.

   [He opens up the case to reveal two ZPMs inside as the wormhole shuts
   down.]

     WOOLSEY

     (incredulous)
     He actually came through for us.

     SHEPPARD

     (dubious)
     Well, maybe he's turning over a new leaf.

     WOOLSEY
     Get those down to Zelenka immediately.

     LORNE
     Yes, sir.

   [Lorne starts to leave.]

     SHEPPARD
     Or maybe they're going to blow up when you plug them in.

     WOOLSEY
     Have Doctor McKay check them first.

     LORNE
     Right.

   [Lorne's team leaves. Sheppard turns to go in the opposite direction.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. I'm heading to the chair room.

     WOOLSEY
     Actually, Colonel, you won't be flying the city for us. In fact, you
     won't be coming with us at all.

   [Sheppard turns back, surprised.]

     SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

     WOOLSEY
     You have a half an hour to pack, and then you'll be gating back to
     Earth. Even with the ZPMs, there's still a good chance we won't get
     there in time. And Earth's only other line of defense is the Ancient
     weapons platform. General O'Neill wants you in the chair.

   [Sheppard bites his lip and nods. Woolsey puts out his hand. Sheppard
   shakes it.]

     WOOLSEY
     Good luck.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. You too.

   [Sheppard heads back the other way.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Sheppard steps through the active Stargate, wearing a large backpack.
   Colonel Carter waits at the bottom of the ramp. She wears blue BDUs
   with the SG-1 patch on her right shoulder. She smiles in greeting.]

     CARTER
     Colonel Sheppard!

     SHEPPARD
     Colonel Carter!

   [She pats him on the back as she leads him out of the room.]

     CARTER
     It's good to see you again, John.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [McKay makes some final adjustments on a control panel.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     All right. I've finished recalibration on the chair. Radek, how are
     things at your end?

     ZELENKA

     (over radio)
     ZPMs are online and functioning one hundred percent. We're good to
     go.

     MCKAY
     Okay! Who's flying this puppy.

   [Beckett quickly enters the room.]

     BECKETT
     That would be me.

     MCKAY

     (nonplussed)
     Carson?

     BECKETT
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     What, they called you in for this?

     BECKETT
     Aye.

     MCKAY
     You must have a higher CIA than I thought.

     BECKETT
     Excuse me?

     MCKAY
     Chair Interface Aptitude. We have a...ranking system.

     BECKETT
     Well, apparently, after Colonel Sheppard, I'm number two.

     MCKAY

     (skeptical)
     Really? I gotta look into that.

     BECKETT
     Well, thanks for the vote of confidence, Rodney.

     MCKAY

     (absently)
     Oh, I'm sure you'll...do fine.

   [Beckett sinks into the chair.]

     BECKETT

     (sighing)
     Great.

   [He leans back in the chair, and it activates.]

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     I suppose I'm ready.

   [He clears his throat.]

   [Carter and Sheppard walk down the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     So, you're in command here, huh?

     CARTER
     Only until General Landry gets back. He's heading up a task force in
     Washington.

   [She reaches into her pocket and pulls out her key card, swiping it at
   the elevator.]

     CARTER
     My next position is to take command of our new Daedalus-class ship.

     SHEPPARD
     The Phoenix?

     CARTER
     Actually...we're renaming it. The General Hammond.

     SHEPPARD

     (sympathetic)
     Oh, yeah. I heard about that. Sorry. It was kinda sudden.

     CARTER

     (sadly)
     Heart attack. I was off-world at the time.

     SHEPPARD
     He was a good man.

     CARTER

     (nodding)
     He really was.

   [Her expression is distant and sad. The elevator doors open, and they
   enter.]

     SHEPPARD
     So, uh, what's next? C-130 to McMurdo?

     CARTER
     Not exactly.

   [The elevator doors close.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [The briefing room has been turned into an operations center with
   people on laptops sitting all around the table. Near the window to the
   Gate Room, Major Paul Davis stands by a monitor. Carter and Sheppard
   enter. Davis and Sheppard shake hands.]

     CARTER
     Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Davis. Homeworld Security.

     SHEPPARD
     Major.

     DAVIS
     Colonel.

     SHEPPARD
     What are we looking at?

   [Davis gestures to the map on the computer screen. It shows Earth
   surrounded by concentric range rings, and the moon with a small red dot
   moving around it.]

     DAVIS
     It's the hive ship. It dropped out of hyperspace and established
     orbit around the moon just before you arrived.

     SHEPPARD
     You've got to be kidding me! It's not supposed to be here for weeks!

     CARTER
     Evidently, this is no ordinary hive ship.

     SHEPPARD

     (ruefully)
     Well, that much I know. What's it doing?

     DAVIS
     For the moment, nothing.

   [The screen shows the hive orbiting the moon.]

     CARTER
     Best we can guess is it's completing it's ZPM upgrades prior to
     launching an attack.

     SHEPPARD
     Then we got to make to make a move first. You got any F-302s?

     DAVIS
     We have a squadron on permanent stand-by with Earth Defense, but
     those birds aren't outfitted for anything more than
     fighter-interceptor duties. There's no way they're gonna take on a
     hive...

     SHEPPARD
     How long to fit 'em with nukes?

     DAVIS

     (looking to Carter)
     Well, that could take some doing.

   [Carter nods.]

     DAVIS
     I'll get right on it.

   [He leaves.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to Carter)
     These pilots have any experience fighting the Wraith?

     CARTER

     (admonishing)
     John, that's not why I brought you here.

     SHEPPARD
     I can sit in the chair and wait for the Wraith to get stronger, or I
     can take the fight to them. What do you want to do?

   [Carter sighs, troubled.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The city-ship of Atlantis flies through hyperspace.]

   INT--WOOLSEY'S OFFICE

   [Woolsey sits at his desk. Teyla and Ronon arrive at the door.]

     TEYLA
     Mister Woolsey. You wanted to see us?

     WOOLSEY
     Yes. Come in, please.

   [They enter and stand in front of his desk.]

     WOOLSEY
     I wanted the opportunity to offer you both one last chance to
     reconsider.

     RONON
     Reconsider what?

     WOOLSEY
     Your involvement in this mission.

   [Teyla sighs and exchanges looks with Ronon.]

     WOOLSEY
     I'm told we're about to pass the outer edge of the Pegasus Galaxy.
     If you wish to be dropped off, now would be the time.

     TEYLA
     Mister Woolsey...

   [Woolsey stands and steps around his desk.]

     WOOLSEY
     We've all grown so accustomed to having you here--as part of the
     team. It's easy to lose sight of the fact that your priorities are
     not necessarily always the same as ours. You're being asked to fly
     to another galaxy, to take what might turn out to be the losing part
     in a battle that isn't yours.

     RONON
     Do you mean like everyone on this base has been doing for the last
     five years?

   [Woolsey smiles and ducks his head.]

     TEYLA

     (smiling)
     Thank you for your consideration, Mister Woolsey, but I can assure
     you it is not necessary.

   [Ronon leans in close to Woolsey with a conspiratorial smile.]

     RONON
     We're not going anywhere.

     WOOLSEY

     (touched)
     Very well.

   [Teyla and Ronon leave.]

   INT--F-302 BAY

   [Sheppard climbs out of a cockpit as technicians make last minute
   adjustments. Carter and Davis enter the hangar.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, it looks like we're ready to go.

     CARTER
     There's been a change of plans. I'm afraid the refit took too long.
     The hive's still in lunar orbit, but we've detected an inbound wave
     of darts.

     SHEPPARD
     I guess they got tired of waiting. Any idea where the target is?

     DAVIS
     We think so. The Wraith message we intercepted contained a warning
     about Earth's defensive capabilities--specifically the drone chair.
     Only in the alternate reality where the message came from, it looks
     like the chair had been moved to Area 51.

     SHEPPARD
     That's where they're heading?

     DAVIS
     We believe so.

     SHEPPARD
     Well...evacuate the base! Let 'em hit it. When they bring the hive
     down, we'll take 'em down from Antarctica.

   [Davis and Carter exchange worried looks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Right?

     CARTER

     (shaking her head)
     I'm sorry, John. I was going to tell you this, but...

     SHEPPARD

     (interrupting)
     Tell me what?

     DAVIS
     The...chair was in violation of the Antarctic non-proliferation
     treaty. After lengthy international negotiations, they finally moved
     it just less than a month ago.

     SHEPPARD
     Where?

     CARTER

     (sighing)
     Area 51.

   [Sheppard sighs and stares, frustrated.]

   EXT--SPACE

     All right, Colonel, they're entering the atmosphere now. Should be
     showing up on the screens momentarily.

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

     All right, we got 'em. Twelve o'clock high. Range: eight kilometers
     and closing fast.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DAVIS

     (into radio)
     You are cleared to engage. Good hunting, Colonel.

   INT--NEVADA AIRSPACE, DAY

   [F-302s fire missiles at the incoming darts, engaging them in a
   dogfight. There are many more darts than F-302s.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter leans down by Davis's screen.]

     DAVID

     (concerned)
     We're seriously outnumbered. They'll never be able to keep them all
     from getting through.

   EXT--NEVADA AIRSPACE, DAY

   [Two darts break away from the dogfight and head for Area 51.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER

     Sheppard, two darts have disengaged. They're headed for the deck.

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

     SHEPPARD
     I'm on it. Riggs, you're with me.

     RIGGS

     (over radio)
     Yes, sir.

   EXT--NEVADA AIRSPACE, DAY

   [Sheppard's and Riggs's F-302s give chase to the two darts as they dive
   toward the ground. Two more darts fall in behind the F-302s, firing on
   them.]

     RIGGS

     (over radio)
     Two more on our six!

   EXT--NEVADA AIRSPACE, DAY

   [The ships weave as they all chase each other. One dart's weapons fire
   catches Riggs's ship. It explodes.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Riggs!
     (to himself)
     Dammit!

   [Sheppard dodges enemy fire while trying to get a bead on the two darts
   in front of him. One dart's weapon clips his wing. His starboard engine
   goes out. He grabs the stick with both hands and tries to regain
   control as his aircraft spins toward the ground, trailing black smoke
   behind it.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DAVIS
     The darts are coming in too fast.

     CARTER
     It's a kamikaze run.

   EXT--NEVADA AIRSPACE, DAY

   [The two darts aim for large buildings on the ground, purposefully
   crashing into them at high speed.]

   spin, or death spiral.]

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

     SHEPPARD
     Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

   EXT--NEVADA AIRSPACE, DAY

   [He finally gets the ship under control just before it hits the ground,
   skimming dust as it levels off.]

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

   [Sheppard sighs in relief, then looks over to see a black cloud rising
   just past the nearby ridge.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Stargate Command, this is Sheppard. Am I seeing what I think I'm
     seeing?

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER

     (into radio, with regret)
     It was a nice try, John. There was just too many of them. The
     chair's been destroyed.

   INT--F-302 COCKPIT

   [Sheppard breathes heavily, looking despondent.]

   [Eyes shining, Sheppard suddenly looks determined. He pulls the control
   stick back, climbing steeply.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [The conversation switches between this location and Sheppard's
   cockpit.]

     CARTER
     Sheppard, what are you doing?

     SHEPPARD
     I've got an idea.

     DAVIS
     He's climbing rapidly. He's heading into the upper atmosphere.

     CARTER

     (angry)
     Sheppard, your orders are to return to the base.

     SHEPPARD
     I've still got a nuke. I'm going to finish this mission.

     CARTER
     You don't have enough fuel! You'll never make it to the hive.

     SHEPPARD
     Ah, he got what he wanted. He's going to come to us.

     DAVIS
     He's right. The hive ship has changed course. They're on their way.

     SHEPPARD
     I've got enough fuel to establish orbit. I'm going to shut
     everything down except basic life support. That way, he won't detect
     me until it's too late.

     CARTER
     Even if that does work, given what we know about this ship, one nuke
     is not going to be enough.

   [Carter and Davis exchange looks.]

     SHEPPARD
     No, not from the outside. I'll wait for him to enter orbit. I'll
     fire up my systems, shoot my way through the dart bay door, and fly
     the damn bomb right down his throat. Then, I'll detonate from the
     inside.

   [Carter's eyes glisten.]

     CARTER
     John, I can't ask you to do that.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you're not asking, I'm volunteering. Look, without that chair,
     Earth is basically defenseless, right?

   [Carter and Davis exchange looks again. Neither answers.]

     SHEPPARD
     Right. Commencing radio silence. Sheppard out.

   [He turns off his radio and flies his F-302 higher.]

     WOOLSEY
     What happened?

     ZELENKA
     We dropped out of hyperspace.

     WOOLSEY
     Don't tell me we're there already.

     MCKAY
     We're not even close. We're on the edge of the Milky Way.

     WOOLSEY
     So, then, why did we drop out?

     MCKAY
     Well, obviously we...

   [McKay looks to Zelenka, who raises his hands and shrugs in frustrated
   ignorance.]

     MCKAY
     We're not sure.

     WOOLSEY
     Doctor...

     MCKAY

     (hyper)
     Look, the hyperdrive hasn't been operated at full power in over ten
     thousand years. It's not surprising there are a few glitches.

     WOOLSEY
     But you can fix it?

     MCKAY

     (intent, annoyed)
     I need to figure out what's wrong first, don't I?

   [He leaves.]

     WOOLSEY
     Zelenka, in the meantime, recalibrate our gate position, so we can
     dial Earth.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, right away.

     WOOLSEY
     We have to apprize them of our situation.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship approaches Earth.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter approaches Davis, who is staring at the large monitor.]

     CARTER
     What's our status?

     DAVIS
     The hive ship has almost reached Earth orbit. They've begun scanning
     us.

     CARTER
     Any word from Sheppard?

   [Davis sits back at his computer.]

     DAVIS
     Not yet. According to my best estimates of his trajectory, his orbit
     won't intersect with the hive's for another twenty minutes. Now, if
     he fires up too early, to close the gap--

     CARTER

     (interrupting)
     They'll detect his presence and send out darts to intercept.

   [Harriman approaches.]

     DAVIS
     Yeah, he wouldn't stand a chance.

     HARRIMAN
     Excuse me, Colonel.

     CARTER
     What is it, Walter?

     HARRIMAN
     We've been trying to dial up the Alpha Site to send through those
     IOA dignitaries?

     DAVIS

     (sarcastic)
     Good old IOA. Courageous to the end.

   [Carter smirks.]

     CARTER

     (to Harriman)
     What's the problem?

     HARRIMAN
     We can't establish a lock, and it's not just the Alpha Site. I've
     already tried a couple of alternates, but for some reason, the
     'gate's offline.

   [Carter sighs, upset.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

     Open a channel.
     (into radio)
     Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.
     (pauses)
     Stargate Command, this is Atlantis, do you read?

   [He turns to Banks.]

     BANKS
     Comm system is operating, sir. They're just not responding.

     MCKAY
     Oh-kay...this is weird. I'm picking up an energy signature feeding
     back through the wormhole. It's Wraith.

     WOOLSEY
     The Wraith are at Stargate Command?

   [Zelenka joins McKay at his station.]

     MCKAY
     No, these readings are more like something you-you'd pick up in the
     middle of a hive.

     WOOLSEY
     But we dialed Earth.

     ZELENKA

     (worried)
     You don't think that...

     MCKAY

     (also worried)
     Standard Wraith procedure. Keep your victims from dialing out.

     WOOLSEY
     What are you talking about?

     MCKAY
     There's a 'gate on the hive!

     WOOLSEY
     What?!

     MCKAY
     The Wraith always try to block the 'gate of a planet they're
     attacking--usually by dialing in. They couldn't do that in this
     case, so they came up with another solution.

     ZELENKA
     You-you see, when two 'gates are in proximity, one supersedes the
     other. Usually, it's the default 'gate, unless it happens to be a
     Milky Way model and the other one's from Pegasus.

     MCKAY
     We encountered exactly the same problem on the Midway Station. We
     had to create a work-around to prevent the Pegasus 'gate from always
     taking precedent.

     WOOLSEY
     You're telling me that wormhole...

   MCKAY Leads directly onto the hive.</blockquote>

   devices roll through the active Stargate. They are grenades.]

   outgoing wormhole.]

     MCKAY
     Think that cleared the way?

   [Ronon unholsters his gun and strides towards the event horizon.]

     RONON
     There's one way to find out.

   [He enters the wormhole without hesitation. The others follow as
   Woolsey looks on from the control room balcony.]

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     The guards at the 'gate have been neutralized. We're moving on.

   [The wormhole shuts down. Woolsey turns to Zelenka, who's standing
   nearby. They walk towards Woolsey's office.]

     WOOLSEY

     (despondent)
     I should've sent more marines with them.

     ZELENKA

     (shaking his head)
     A full scale assault wouldn't have accomplished anything. If they're
     going to sabotage key systems on that hive, they're going to need
     speed and stealth.

     WOOLSEY
     Maybe. I just hate being stuck out here in the middle of nowhere and
     not able to do anything.

     ZELENKA
     Actually, that's something I've been wanting to talk to you about.

   [They stop walking.]

     ZELENKA

     (referring to the computer he's holding)
     This is something that Rodney's been working on for quite some time.
     It's an adaptation of an Ancient technology which was abandoned
     because of instability and...enormous power requirements.

     WOOLSEY
     What is it?

     ZELENKA
     Wormhole drive. It-it's nearly instantaneous travel across enormous
     distances. It's not unlike gate travel itself. If it works, it could
     have us at Earth in a matter of seconds. Now, the calculations are
     incredibly complex. If we're off even by a fraction...it could be
     very bad.

   behind various ship structures.]

     RONON

     MCKAY
     This way!

   [McKay and Ronon start down another corridor. Ronon cautiously turns a
   corner, but is ambushed by a Wraith who knocks his gun away and fights
   him hand-to-hand. McKay raises his gun but can't get a clear shot. He's
   ambushed from behind by another Wraith who disarms him. Ronon still
   struggles with his guard as the other Wraith tries to get his feeding
   hand through McKay's layers of tactical equipment and clothing. Teyla
   and Lorne fight a separate gun battle.]

   [Ronon finally gets the upper hand by using the Wraith's stunner as a
   blunt weapon, hitting the soldier multiple times and knocking it back.
   Ronon then strikes the one holding McKay, pulling it back by using the
   stunner in a choke hold, finally defeating him. The warrior Ronon
   originally fought pulls a dagger from its boot and stabs Ronon in the
   back. Ronon screams in agony as McKay watches helplessly.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Sheppard's F-302 fires a missile into the dart bay, blasting a hole
   open just before flying through the hole into the ship. Once inside, it
   maneuvers its way into the inner sections of the vessel.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Teyla arrives, shooting the remaining Wraith. On the floor, Ronon
   pants and feels his back for the wound as McKay rushes to him.]

     MCKAY
     Ronon!

     RONON
     Ah!

   [Teyla rushes over. Lorne also arrives and continues to provide cover
   fire for them. Teyla crouches next to Ronon by McKay. Ronon's mouth is
   filling with blood.]

     TEYLA
     Is it bad?

     MCKAY
     They hit his lung! He's bleeding out!

     TEYLA
     Ronon!

     RONON

     (between pained breaths)
     Just go...Just go!

     TEYLA
     No! We are not leaving without you!

   [Ronon looks at her, then dies, his eyes remaining open.]

     TEYLA
     Ronon?! RONON!

   [McKay pants in disbelief. More Wraith arrive, and Teyla immediately
   opens fire on them, McKay covering his ears from the percussion of
   noise. Lorne clears the way behind them then goes to help Teyla. He
   pulls her away from Ronon's body.]

     LORNE
     Come on, we gotta get out of here now! Let's go!

   [He drags McKay up and provides cover fire as they run away.]

     LORNE
     Come on, come on, come on. Let's go!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter waits impatiently.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Stargate Command, this is Sheppard. Come in.

     CARTER
     Sheppard, where are you?

   INT--HIVE SHIP

   [Sheppard's F-302 sits on a small landing area near a door.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I made it inside. Look, I don't have much time before this place is
     swarming with Wraith, so...I'm arming the nuke.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [The conversation switches between the briefing room and the F-302.]

     CARTER

     (upset)
     John...

     SHEPPARD
     Just do me a favor, when Atlantis shows up...tell 'em I said
     goodbye.

   [Carter sighs.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDORS

   [McKay, now unarmed, ducks behind a pillar and grabs his scanner while
   Teyla and Lorne continue to shoot.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Stargate Command, this is Sheppard. Come in....Look, I don't have
     much time before this place is swarming with Wraith, so...I'm arming
     the nuke.

   [Lorne and Teyla stop firing and look at each other and McKay in
   shock.]

     MCKAY

     (panicked)
     What? Did he say "nuke"?!

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Just do me a favor, when Atlantis shows up...tell 'em I said
     goodbye.

   [Lorne hands McKay his sidearm.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Sheppard! This is McKay! Look, stop what you're doing now!

   [The conversation switches between the corridor and the F-302.]

     SHEPPARD

     (confused)
     McKay?

     MCKAY
     Yes, it's me! I've got Lorne! I've got Teyla! We're on board the
     hive.

     SHEPPARD
     What?! Wha--how?

     MCKAY

     (rushed)
     Look, it's a long story...just...important thing is, if you're about
     to do what I think you're gonna do, don't.

     SHEPPARD
     This hive is about to attack Earth, Rodney. I don't have much of a
     choice.

     MCKAY
     Look, just wait. We'll come to you. I'm sure I can rig up some kind
     of a...remote detonator.

     SHEPPARD
     What good's that gonna do for us? We can't get off this ship,
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     That's where you're wrong.

   [He checks his scanner, then gestures to Lorne and Teyla, his sidearm
   at ready.]

     MCKAY
     This way.

   [They head out.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Woolsey enters, approaching Keller, who is looking over charts with a
   nurse. She sees him and steps away from the nurse.]

     WOOLSEY
     Doctor Keller. I wanted to let you know that we're about to fire up
     the wormhole drive. If it works, we could find ourselves in the
     middle of a combat situation rather suddenly. You and your staff
     need to be ready.

     KELLER

     (taken aback)
     And-and if it doesn't?

     WOOLSEY
     From what I'm told, the city would be...instantly vaporized.

   [Keller stares at him in wide-eyed shock.]

     KELLER

     (weakly, then stronger)
     Oh...okay.

   [Woolsey walks away.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP, OUTSIDE LANDING PLATFORM

   [Sheppard hides by a pillar just outside where his F-302 is parked. A
   console is nearby. He braces himself then spins, weapon ready, to
   confront anything on the other side. Lorne, Teyla, and McKay are there,
   their own weapons at ready, the weapon flashlights shining at
   Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD

     (relieved)
     You guys are the last people I expected to see on this ship.

   [McKay runs into the landing bay.]

     MCKAY
     Same here. Gimme a minute.

   [He starts working on his computer by the aircraft.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where's Ronon?

   [Teyla Teyla stares at Sheppard in shock and grief and doesn't answer.
   Lorne looks away.]

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla, where's Ronon?

   [Teyla slowly shakes her head.]

     TEYLA

     (quietly)
     I'm sorry, John.

   [Sheppard stares at her, stricken by the news.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Ronon comes to life dramatically with a pained breath. The Wraith
   known as Kenny has its feeding hand on Ronon's chest.]

     RONON
     Ah. Oh.

   [He pants, looking around in shock. Kenny removes his hand.]

     KENNY
     I restored your life, human, and bound your wound.

   [Ronon groans, looking around frantically.]

     RONON

     (drily)
     That was real nice of you.

     KENNY
     Now you will answer my questions.

   [Kenny stands.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DAVIS
     Hive has completed surface scan.

     CARTER
     They'll target military installations first, then the power grid.
     Send the population into a panic. Then, they'll launch the darts.

   INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

     KENNY
     How many humans are on my ship?

   [Ronon says nothing. Kenny grinds the heel of his boot around Ronon's
   wound. Ronon can't prevent a pained cry.]

     KENNY
     Where are they?!

   [Ronon snarls in defiance. Weapons fire strikes Kenny and his guards.
   Ronon looks over in surprise to see his teammates, including Sheppard,
   arrive. They look equally shocked to see him alive. Teyla and Sheppard
   help Ronon to his feet.]

     SHEPPARD
     How ya doin', Chewie?

     RONON

     (standing with pained grunt)
     Ow. Oh.

     MCKAY

     (in disbelief)
     You were dead!

   [Lorne and Sheppard help Ronon limp away as Teyla protects their rear.]

     SHEPPARD
     We're all gonna be dead unless we get out of here.

   [They leave.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DAVIS
     That's it. They're powering weapons.

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Sheppard, what's your status?

   INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [The conversation switches from the corridor to the briefing room.]

     SHEPPARD
     We got Ronon. We're headed to the 'gate.

     CARTER
     How much time?

     MCKAY
     Five minutes to get there, five minutes to recalibrate the DHD for
     local coordinates.

     SHEPPARD
     Ten minutes.

     CARTER
     I'm sorry. The hive is powering weapons. We're out of time.

   [The team pauses in the corridor and they exchange stricken looks.]

     SHEPPARD

     Understood.
     (to McKay)
     Give me the detonator.

     MCKAY

     (desperate)
     Yeah...but we're almost there. I mean...look, did I say five minutes
     to recalibrate the DHD? I meant two minutes.

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney...

   [He holds out his hand. McKay enters some commands and resignedly hands
   it over. Everyone exchanges looks. Sheppard takes a breath and readies
   the detonation.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     John, wait! We're detecting another ship!

   EXT--SPACE

   [Atlantis rises towards the hive from out of nowhere, still shielded
   setting itself between the hive and Earth.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WOOLSEY
     Now would be the time, Doctor.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     BECKETT
     Understood.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Many drones launch from the city, fly through the shield, and strike
   the hive.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR

   [The team feels the impact of the weapons.]

     CARTER

     (over radio)
     It's Atlantis! They're engaging the hive!

     SHEPPARD
     That might give us enough time to get to the 'gate.

   [He hands the controller back to McKay, and they all run towards the
   Stargate.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     BANKS
     Sir, the hive is returning fire.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive's blue drones swarm towards Atlantis, impacting the shield.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sparks fly as some equipment overloads.]

     BANKS
     Shields are down to seventy percent.

     WOOLSEY

     (into radio)
     Keep firing, Doctor Beckett!

   INT--HIVE SHIP STARGATE ROOM

   [The team arrives.]

     SHEPPARD
     Get to work, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     I'm on it.

   [McKay rushes to the DHD and starts to manipulate the lower control
   panel. Lorne spots Wraith approaching.]

     LORNE
     We've got company!

   [The others shoot at the Wraith.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Wraith drones continue to bombard the city-ship's shields.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Many sparks fly from the equipment.]

     ZELENKA
     The force of enemy weapons fire has pushed us into a lower orbit.
     We're skimming the atmosphere!

     BANKS
     It's draining the shields, sir!

     WOOLSEY

     (into radio)
     Doctor Beckett, can you adjust our course?

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     BECKETT

     (into radio)
     I don't have enough power. I can keep firing, or pull us up. Which
     is it going to be?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Woolsey exchanges looks with Banks.]

     WOOLSEY

     (into radio)
     Keep firing, Doctor Beckett.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [Beckett closes his eyes in concentration.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Atlantis and the hive ship continue to exchange fire in orbit over
   Earth.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP STARGATE ROOM

   [The team continues to exchange fire with the Wraith.]

     SHEPPARD

     (shouting over gunfire)
     How's it coming, Rodney?

   [McKay closes up the DHD panel.]

     MCKAY
     I've got it! Dialing the Alpha Site now!

   [He proceeds to dial the DHD.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sparks and smoke fill the room as the technicians duck and try to
   remain at their stations.]

     BANKS
     Shields are about to collapse. We can't take another hit.

   INT--HIVE SHIP STARGATE ROOM

   [The Stargate activates.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right, let's move!

   [The team heads to the event horizon, Sheppard providing rear cover
   fire as the others run through. McKay hands Sheppard the detonator
   before running himself. Sheppard sets its timer and leaves it at the
   DHD before following the others.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP LANDING PLATFORM

   [Sheppard's F-302 nuclear weapon activates, the cockpit display
   signaling it is now armed.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP STARGATE ROOM

   [Sheppard fires his weapon a final time as he backs into the wormhole.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship explodes.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     DAVIS
     They did it!

   [Everyone laughs in relief and celebration. Some applaud.]

     DAVIS
     The hive's been destroyed!

     CARTER

     (smiling, into radio)
     Atlantis, this is Stargate Command. Well done!

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WOOLSEY

     (into radio)
     Thanks for the kind words, Colonel, but I wouldn't pop the champagne
     just yet. We've lost orbit, and Doctor Beckett is unable to
     compensate. We're goin' in!

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER

     (concerned, into radio)
     Do you have enough shield to survive reentry?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Zelenka shakes his head and shrugs.]

     WOOLSEY

     (with dread)
     We're about to find out.

   EXT--SPACE

   [Atlantis falls to Earth, the shield taking the brunt of the
   atmospheric friction.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Explosions rock the room.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

     CARTER

     (worried, into radio)
     Atlantis this is Stargate Command. Do you read?

   EXT--SPACE

   [Atlantis, its shield not visible, falls through the sky as a small
   object when viewed from orbit.]

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Harriman arrives.]

     HARRIMAN
     Colonel! We've been monitoring radio chatter. Several commercial
     vessels in the North Pacific have reported a giant fireball
     streaking across the sky.

   [Davis puts his hands to his face in worry.]

     CARTER

     (desperately, into radio)
     Atlantis, this is Stargate Command. Do you read? Atlantis, this is
     Stargate Command. Please respond!

   [There is silence for several seconds.]

     WOOLSEY

     (over radio)
     Stargate Command, this is Atlantis. Nice to hear from you again,
     Colonel.

   [The room breaks out in smiles and a visible release of tension. Davis
   laughs.]

     CARTER

     (into radio, pleased)
     Mister Woolsey, you gave us quite a scare.

     WOOLSEY

     (over radio)
     Sorry about that.

   EXT--PACIFIC OCEAN AIRSPACE, DAY

   [Atlantis flies towards the ocean, its shield still visible.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The smoke is clearing. Earth daylight shines from the Gate room
   windows.]

     WOOLSEY
     We've completed our reentry and as far as I can tell, we're still in
     one piece. Doctor Beckett thinks he can bring us in over water,
     but...you might want to alert the Navy. It's gonna be close.

   INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM

   [Carter signals Davis with a pat on the shoulder.]

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Understood.

     DAVIS
     We are tracking them again.

   [He turns to where Carter is already looking at the large monitor. It
   shows Atlantis has travelled from the east coast of Asia to its current
   position northwest of Hawaii.]

     DAVIS
     We should be able to project coordinates for splashdown.

     CARTER

     (to Harriman)
     Walter, you'd better get me the President. It looks like Atlantis is
     coming home.

   [Carter smiles, her eyes glistening.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Ronon lies in an infirmary bed wearing scrubs. Sheppard leans on the
   footrest.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, how you feelin?

     RONON
     I'm ready to get out of here.

     SHEPPARD
     Take your time. The city's pretty banged up. Even with the ZPMs,
     we're not goin' anywhere for a while.

     RONON
     And when they fix it? Do you really think they're going to let us
     take it back to Pegasus?

     SHEPPARD
     I'll make sure you get home.

     RONON
     This is my home.

   [Banks arrives, her hair down and dressed in civilian clothing.]

     BANKS
     Am I interrupting?

   [Sheppard exchanges looks with Ronon, who smiles at him. Sheppard looks
   back at Banks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Uh...no, uh...I was just leaving.

   [Sheppard leaves. Banks approaches Ronon's bed. Ronon smiles at Banks
   and tries to sit up better.]

     BANKS

     (nervously)
     Hi...I heard you...died...and came back to life.

     RONON
     Pretty much. There's, uh, there's a few things I still need to do.

     BANKS

     (smiling)
     You up for taking a walk?

     RONON
     I don't see why not.

     BANKS
     Good. There's something you should see.

   [She moves to help him out of bed.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Sheppard enters. Todd stands by the table. Sheppard crosses his arms.]

     TODD
     So, all is well! Your homeworld was saved, you and your friends
     survived, and all thanks to my zero point modules.

     SHEPPARD
     That's right. The question is, what would happen next time?

     TODD

     (warily)
     Is there going to be a next time?

   [Sheppard studies him.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY

   [Banks helps Ronon out to the balcony. Keller, McKay, Teyla, Woolsey,
   and Beckett are already there.]

     BANKS
     You have room for two more?

     WOOLSEY
     Of course!

   [Teyla rubs Ronon's shoulder comfortingly as he steps up next to her.]

     WOOLSEY
     Ronon, welcome to Earth.

   [They all stare at the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco, California
   and into the bay beyond it.]

     KELLER

     (cautiously)
     No one can see us, right?

     WOOLSEY
     We managed to activate the cloak before we came in too close. This
     entire area is under naval quarantine.

   [Sheppard arrives and stands between Teyla and Ronon.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, so this is where everyone went, huh?

   [Keller nudges McKay, who's looking at the view with a pensive
   expression.]

     KELLER
     You okay?

     MCKAY

     (drily)
     I'm alive.

   [Keller snickers. McKay puts his arm around her, pulling her close.]

     MCKAY
     And I've got you. What else do I need?

     SHEPPARD
     Nice view.

     WOOLSEY
     Yes. Yes, it is.
