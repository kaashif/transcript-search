   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay enters, still in the red jumpsuit he had worn on the Puddle
   Jumper. Weir and Sheppard are there, Weir carrying a briefcase.]

     WEIR
     Welcome back, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Where are we?

     WEIR
     Our scanners show the hive ships have started moving again, although
     their pace has slowed considerably.

     SHEPPARD
     Obviously, you gave them something to think about.

     WEIR
     If they get here in two hours or two days, it doesn't change the
     fact that we're out of options. We can't hope to fight them. So,
     unless either of you have any more ideas...

   [Ford arrives, geared up and holding a machine gun.]

     FORD
     The last group is assembled and ready for evac.

     WEIR
     All right, then. Let's get this done.

   [Sheppard, Weir, and McKay each stand at a different laptop.]

     WEIR
     Ready?

   [They each enter their passwords. After a moment, a clock shows ten
   hours and counting.]

     WEIR

     Self-destruct is armed.
     (to Technician)
     Prepare to load the virus into the Ancient mainframe. Rodney, dial
     the Alpha site.

     MCKAY
     Dialing.

   [He starts to dial, but stops when chevrons start lighting up.]

     MCKAY
     We've got an incoming wormhole.

   [The wormhole forms.]

     MCKAY
     We're receiving an IDC.

     SHEPPARD
     Who is it?

     MCKAY

     (amazed)
     Stargate Command.

     WEIR
     Are you sure?

     MCKAY
     Positive!

     WEIR
     Lower the shields.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Col. Everett and other personnel start coming through the 'gate, as
   well as boxes of supplies. Sheppard and the others rush down to meet
   them.]

     EVERETT
     Dr. Weir.

     WEIR
     Yes.

     EVERETT
     Colonel Dillon Everett, United States Marine Corps.

     WEIR
     You should know--

     EVERETT
     General O'Neill sends his compliments on a job well done under
     extraordinary circumstances. You are relieved.

     SHEPPARD
     Sir, we're about to evacuate?

     EVERETT
     Without a fight.

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir.

     WEIR
     On my order.

     EVERETT
     That evacuation order is rescinded. I assume you've armed the
     self-destruct device?

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir, we have, but as Dr. Weir was trying to tell you--

     EVERETT
     I am going to need you to disarm it immediately.

     WEIR
     Hold on a second, Colonel. I don't think you fully grasp our
     situation.

     EVERETT
     You have three Wraith hive ships bearing down on your position and
     precious little to defend yourselves with. That about sum it up?

     MCKAY
     You got our message.

     EVERETT
     We got your message.

     WEIR
     It's down to two hive ships. We managed to destroy one.

     EVERETT

     (brightly)
     Good for you. That should make my job a little easier.

     SHEPPARD
     What exactly is your job, sir?

     EVERETT

     (very militarily)
     I should think that would be obvious to you by now, Major. We are
     going to defend Atlantis at all costs.

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Everett is walking away, up the stairs.]

     WEIR
     Colonel?

     EVERETT

     (handing her a piece of paper)
     Signed by General O'Neill.

     SHEPPARD
     Colonel, it's not that we don't appreciate the thought, but if you
     had read the report on the armada headed this way, you'd know that
     there's not much we can do about it.

     EVERETT
     Oh, I read your report cover to cover, Major.

     MCKAY
     They must have found a ZPM. That's the only way they could have
     dialed in from Earth.

     EVERETT
     It was discovered in Egypt by a group of archaeologists. The damn
     thing has been under our noses the whole time.

     MCKAY
     Fantastic. Wait a minute. How could you possibly bring the ZPM back
     here? You need it to maintain the wormhole.

     EVERETT
     As we speak, it is being transported up to the Daedalus, our new
     battlecruiser.

     MCKAY
     Sister ship of the Prometheus. I didn't even know it was finished.

     EVERETT
     With the ZPM boosting her engines, she should be here inside of four
     days. That is how long we have to hold this base. Major Sheppard
     dial Pegasus Alpha Site, recall all military personnel. As well, any
     civilians who would like to return and help take part in damage
     control are welcome to do so. And when you're done with that, please
     join me and my officers in the conference room. We'll discuss our
     tactical position.

     WEIR
     Colonel Everett? Fine, you're in charge, but I should be at that
     briefing.

     EVERETT
     When it comes down to any other aspect of Atlantis, I will be happy
     to include you. We're talking about our tactical position.

     WEIR
     I understand that.

     EVERETT
     Good. Somebody want to please turn off that self-destruct?

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Everett is being briefed.]

     EVERETT
     This schematic is based on the information we got in your message.
     Can I assume it's accurate?

     FORD
     Yes, Sir.

     EVERETT
     Captain, deploy plan alpha-two.

     RADNER
     Yes, Sir. Sergeant, alpha-two.

     FORD
     If you don't mind my asking, Colonel, deploy what exactly?

     EVERETT
     We brought along a few rail guns. They were originally slated for
     Prometheus to replace their current close-in armament on her next
     refit. They will deliver an impact velocity of Mach 5 at 250 miles.
     A standard magazine will hold 10,000 rounds.

     FORD
     Whoa.

   [Sheppard and Weir arrive.]

     SHEPPARD
     The self-destruct has been aborted.

     EVERETT
     Thank you. Did you contact the Alpha Site?

     WEIR
     I asked Major Sheppard to wait until I had a chance to talk with
     you.

     EVERETT
     Is that a fact?

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir.

     EVERETT
     Major, dial the Alpha site.

     WEIR
     Colonel, you've been here all of five minutes. Now, I have been
     responsible for the lives of the people on this base both military
     and civilian, for the past several months. I'm not about to put
     those lives in jeopardy until I at least know how you intend to
     defend this city.

     EVERETT
     I don't need to explain myself to you, Doctor, and I don't need your
     cooperation.

     SHEPPARD
     But you could probably use mine. Sir. So with all due respect,
     please answer Dr. Weir's question.

     EVERETT
     Is that a threat, Major?

     SHEPPARD
     No, sir. I understand you need to establish a clear chain of
     command, but if you cut Dr. Weir out of the loop, you'll only
     alienate the people whose trust and respect she's earned. Which is
     everyone on the base. Including me.

     EVERETT
     Is that a fact? ...Have a seat.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay talks to Zelenka and other scientists.]

     MCKAY
     I should be in that meeting. I am the foremost expert on the defense
     capabilities of this city.

     ZELENKA
     You know how it is. When military steps in, scientists take a back
     seat.

     MCKAY
     Until they need us.

     ZELENKA
     They don't think they need us.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, they don't think they need us right up until the point that
     they need us, and then...they need us.

     ZELENKA
     Then they need us. Take a look at this.

   [They look down into the control room where SGC personnel are
   un-crating weapons.]

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

     EVERETT
     Six Naquadah-enhanced nuclear warheads, twelve hundred megatons
     apiece. They emit almost zero EM and are otherwise invisible to
     radar. Once deployed, they will detonate by proximity fuse.

     FORD
     Space mines?

     RADNER
     That's right. We'll use jumpers in stealth mode to place them in a
     pattern between the armada and Atlantis. Major, we were hoping you
     could help us with that.

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, but I recommend keeping a couple in reserve.

     EVERETT
     Negative. We're only going to get one shot at this.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you have to consider the possibility--

     EVERETT
     Four of my men are pilots. Beckett is giving them the gene
     inoculation right now. Assuming it takes, you will familiarize them
     with the jumpers, and they will become our fighter screen.

     SHEPPARD
     Along with me.

     EVERETT
     I have another job for you. I understand that this base is equipped
     with a chair weapons platform, like the one we found in Antarctica.

     WEIR
     Yes, but we have no way of powering it.

     EVERETT
     We do now. We brought a Mark II Naquadah generator.

     RADNER
     We found a way to increase the power output by six hundred percent.
     It won't last nearly as long, but it should power the chair for as
     long as we need it to.

     SHEPPARD
     This is beginning to sound like a plan.

     EVERETT

     (sarcastically)
     I'm glad you approve.
     (officiously)
     We know this is a long shot, but like I said, all we have to do is
     hold out until the Daedalus gets here, then we can use the ZPM to
     power the city shield. Any questions? All right, then.
     (condescending)
     Now that Dr. Weir has been informed of our plans, I would greatly
     appreciate it if you'd execute my order and contact the Alpha Site.

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir.

   [Sheppard starts to leave.]

     EVERETT
     And Major. This is last time I give you an order twice.

     SHEPPARD
     Understood.

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

   [Personnel assemble the rail guns.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard briefs the new pilots on flying the Puddle Jumpers.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [McKay and Zelenka work to connect the chair to the naquadah
   generator.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [Four Puddle Jumpers leave Atlantis.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ARMORY

   [Both civilians and military personnel receive arms.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Jumpers fly through space.]

   INT--ATLANTIS TRAINING ROOM

   [Teyla spars with a male Athosian, each of them holding a knife and
   stick. Everett and some of his men watch from the doorway.]

     EVERETT

     (impressed)
     You must be Teyla.

   [They stop sparring, and she touches foreheads with the man.]

     TEYLA
     And you are Colonel Everett.

     EVERETT
     Major Sheppard spoke very highly of you in his report. Of course, a
     more recent report has me a little concerned.

     TEYLA
     You think I may once again fall under the influence of the Wraith?

     EVERETT
     Major Sheppard assures me that won't happen, but I do need you to
     stay out of the way.

     TEYLA

     (angry)
     Do you not need every able body to help defend Atlantis?

     EVERETT
     I think we can handle it.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [Beckett is in the chair.]

     MCKAY
     He's not even trying.

     BECKETT
     We've tried this a dozen times.

     ZELENKA
     But never with this power source.

     BECKETT
     I'm serious. Major Sheppard's your man.

     MCKAY
     Of course he is, but he's training pilots and deploying space mines
     right now, so we're stuck with you. Now, listen to me very
     carefully, do exactly what I tell you to do, and hopefully no one
     will get hurt.

     BECKETT
     Rodney, there must be someone else.

     MCKAY

     (sternly)
     Concentrate on powering up the chair. Nothing else, nothing more,
     nothing but. Don't start thinking--

     BECKETT
     Don't tell me what not to start thinking about, or I'll start
     thinking about it!

     MCKAY

     (falsely kind)
     Please power it up.

   [Beckett closes his eyes and concentrates. The chair powers up.]

     MCKAY

     (looking at a tablet)
     Good. Good... Good. And...oh, no.

     BECKETT
     What? Did I do something wrong?

   [McKay walks away.]

     ZELENKA
     So...see? Nothing to worry about.

   [McKay comes back.]

     MCKAY
     Get him out of the chair.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay arrives.]

     MCKAY
     Elizabeth. Excuse me. I've hooked up the generator, and the chair
     platform is operational.

     EVERETT
     That's good news.

     MCKAY
     Not so much.

     WEIR
     Why? What's wrong?

     MCKAY
     We're down to just a few dozen drones.

     EVERETT
     And you're just finding this out now?

     MCKAY
     There was no way of determining that until the chair was
     initialized, and that was only possible once the Mark II was tied
     in.

     EVERETT
     The chair in Antarctica controlled thousands of the damn things.

     MCKAY
     Yes. I know. They were probably used defending Atlantis the first
     time the Wraith attacked the Ancients.

     WEIR
     Even a few dozen will help us keep them at bay for a while.

   [An alarm starts blaring.]

     WEIR
     What is it?

     TECHNICIAN
     We have incoming. I don't know where they came from. They just
     appeared all of a sudden.

   [Sheppard rushes in.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's going on?

     WEIR
     We've just detected a wave of objects approaching the planet.

     EVERETT
     How many?

     TECHNICIAN
     A hundred plus.

     SHEPPARD
     How come they weren't detected by the long-range sensors?

     MCKAY
     Because they're rocks... Asteroids. The Wraith must have harvested
     them from this system's asteroid belt and accelerated them towards
     us from a safe distance. The mainframe's taken this long to
     determine that they were a threat.

     WEIR
     Can they do much damage?

     MCKAY
     Oh, yeah. Even if most of them burn off in the atmosphere,
     but...that's not why they're doing it.

     EVERETT
     They're headed toward the mines.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, can they be deactivated?

     EVERETT
     No.

   [The display shows the asteroids approaching the mines. All of the
   mines explode in seconds.]

     MCKAY
     Well...that's that. Your mines make one hell of a bang, Colonel. I'm
     sure the Wraiths' ears are ringing.

     SHEPPARD
     What's the status of the hive ships?

     MCKAY
     There's no way of knowing. The mine detonations must have overloaded
     the sensors.

     EVERETT
     How long till they're back up?

     TECHNICIAN
     There's a lot of residual radiation.

     MCKAY
     It'll keep us blind for hours.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, well, they're still out there, and we just lost our primary
     line of defense.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS ANCIENT ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     You wanted to see me, Colonel?

     EVERETT
     I was told I could learn a lot about the history of Atlantis in this
     room.

     SHEPPARD
     We haven't used it much because of the power requirements.

     EVERETT
     Still, I would like to see for myself how the Ancients lost the
     first time, try to avoid their mistakes.

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, Sir, we could do that.

   [Sheppard activates the console. A display appears above them.]

     SHEPPARD
     This is the status of the Pegasus Galaxy before the Ancients
     encountered the Wraith. The blue stars represent systems either
     inhabited by or protected by the Ancients. Then... This is how it
     looked after they fought for almost a hundred years.

   [All of the blue stars turn red.]

     EVERETT
     Until Atlantis was all that was left?

     SHEPPARD
     Yes, sir. That's when the siege began.

   [A planetary-scale display appears. Various battles are portrayed as
   Sheppard speaks.]

     SHEPPARD
     For several more years, the Atlantians were able to hold off their
     attackers, relying on the city's shield and superior weaponry,
     including the weapons satellite system. No matter how many Wraith
     ships they destroyed, more kept coming here. They could win almost
     every battle, but they saw no way to win the war. So...they
     submerged the city...and left.

   [Sheppard deactivates the console.]

     SHEPPARD
     That's it. That's the story. But the picture is pretty clear.

     EVERETT
     So you think this is a no-win situation?

     SHEPPARD
     No, sir. What I mean is, even if we beat them this time, they're
     going to come back.

     EVERETT
     Major...I think I should tell you that Colonel Marshall Sumner was a
     very good friend of mine. We served together a lot of years and you
     know...I cannot, for the life of me, figure how it is that you could
     go as far as you did and not save him. How you could get that
     close--

     SHEPPARD
     By the time I reached Colonel Sumner--

     EVERETT
     Worse, you admit to firing the shot that killed him.

     SHEPPARD
     Because I believe that's what he wanted me to do.

     EVERETT
     You knew him that well, did you?

     SHEPPARD
     You weren't there, sir.

   [Everett approaches Sheppard.]

     EVERETT
     I wish, for his sake, I was.

     SHEPPARD
     There isn't a night that doesn't go by where that moment doesn't
     play in my head... And every time it does--

   [An alarm sounds.]

     EVERETT AND SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Control room--

     EVERETT

     (into radio)
     This is Colonel Everett. Report.

     SOLDIER

     (over radio)
     Sir, we've just detected a wave of darts inbound.

     EVERETT

     (into radio)
     I'm on my way.
     (to Sheppard)
     Head to the chair. We'll finish this later.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     EVERETT
     What's happening?

     TECHNICIAN
     Multiple signals, sir, closing fast. Dr. McKay must've been right
     about the nukes damaging the sensors. We couldn't see them until
     they were right on top of us.

     EVERETT
     Are my gunners in position?

     TECHNICIAN
     Yes, sir.

     EVERETT
     How about our damage control parties?

     WEIR
     They're all in position.

     EVERETT
     All right. Darken the city.

   [The Technician uses controls to darken the city.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   [The city lights go out.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

   [The SGC soldiers prepare to use the rail guns and regular machine
   guns.]

     RADNER
     Remember, short steady bursts. Here they come!

   [The battle rages, with tracers showing the firing of the darts and SGC
   weapons.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [Sheppard rushes in.]

     SHEPPARD
     McKay, fire it up!

     MCKAY
     It'll take a minute.

     SHEPPARD
     We don't have a minute.

   [He sits in the chair.]

     MCKAY
     Look, this generator can only power the chair because it operates in
     a state of barely-controlled overload--

     SHEPPARD
     Just get the damn thing working.

     MCKAY
     That's what I'm trying to do.

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

     RADNER

     (into radio)
     Colonel, it's Radner.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     EVERETT

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     RADNER

     (over radio)
     It looks like some of them are starting to make kamikaze runs.

   [There are nearby explosions.]

     WEIR
     What happened?

     TECHNICIAN
     We lost primary systems.

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

     AIRMAN
     Go! Go!

   [Weir and Everett step outside to see the battle raging.]

   [At one rail gun position, a Dart flies over and sweeps up all of the
   personnel in a culling beam.]

     EVERETT

     (into radio)
     One of our gun positions is dark. Ferrell, why aren't you firing?
     Ferrell, report.

     FORD

     (into radio)
     Colonel, this is Lieutenant Ford. I'm near Ferrell's position. I'm
     on it!

   [Ford runs up the stairs.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [Sheppard activates the chair.]

     MCKAY
     You've got power. Go!

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   [The drone hatch opens, and drones emerge and head for the Darts.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

   [Ford take a position by himself at the rail gun and fires at the
   Darts.]

   [Elsewhere, all personnel fire their weapons.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   [Drones fly out to meet the Darts; tracers of weapons from both size
   light up the sky. Two Darts approach the city. They are both destroyed.
   The blast causes Everett to put his arms protectively around Weir on
   the balcony.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [Sheppard continues to use the chair, his eyes closed.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   [A Dart tries to get away, but a drone takes it out.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

   [The attack appears to be over. Weir and Everett survey the situation.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The city is quiet, but smoke rises from several damaged sections.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     MCKAY
     Power is out in sections of the city. The long-range scanners and
     the internal sensors are down, but we're working on it.

     EVERETT
     I want to know the status of those hive ships ASAP.

     MCKAY
     They're coming. That's their status. Tomorrow, the day after, the
     day after that--eventually, they'll get here. Whether we're here to
     greet them or not is another matter.

     WEIR
     Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Look, the chair is out of drones. How do you expect to handle the
     next wave?

     EVERETT
     I'm open to suggestions.

     MCKAY
     Really?

     SHEPPARD
     We target the hive ships.

     EVERETT
     With what?

     SHEPPARD
     We fly the Puddle Jumper in stealth mode right down their throats.

     EVERETT
     Are you volunteering for a suicide mission?

     SHEPPARD
     It won't be a suicide mission if McKay and Zelenka can figure out a
     way to remote control the Jumpers.

   [Zelenka and McKay are not pleased.]

     EVERETT
     Can you do it?

     MCKAY
     I knew this was going to happen.

     EVERETT
     Is that a fact?

     MCKAY
     Yes, it's a fact. Look, you show up here with your guns and your
     brush cuts, but when it comes to actually saving the city you turn
     to the scientists... And every time, what you ask is impossible.

     EVERETT
     When was the last time you slept, Doctor?

     MCKAY
     Shut up. I have an idea.

     ZELENKA
     The chair.

     MCKAY
     Of course, the chair. The problem is tying it to the Jumper's
     systems.

     ZELENKA
     Without overloading the generators.

     MCKAY
     Possibly using the drones on the Jumpers themselves as a means of
     propulsion--

     ZELENKA
     While increasing the inertial dampening to maximum.

     MCKAY
     It won't be very maneuverable, but possibly, possibly...

     EVERETT
     Is that a "yes?"

     MCKAY
     No, it's a "possibly."

     EVERETT
     I'll take it. How much damage can one Puddle Jumper do?

     SHEPPARD
     I've got an idea about that, too. I think I know where we can get
     another nuke.

     WEIR
     Major, I don't know how sympathetic the Genii will be to our
     situation.

     EVERETT
     The Genii?

     SHEPPARD
     They want to test their weapon. Now's their chance.

     TEYLA

     (from the 'gate room)
     Let me past! I need to talk to Dr. Weir!

   [Weir, Everett and Sheppard go to the railing.]

     WEIR
     Teyla? What's the matter?

     TEYLA
     The Wraith...they are in Atlantis.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Later, personnel are gearing up in the 'gate room.]

     FORD
     The Wraith piloting the kamikaze ships beam into the city right
     before they hit.

     EVERETT
     So they're trying to take the city intact. How many are we talking
     about?

     SHEPPARD
     How many Darts crashed?

     EVERETT
     Between twenty and thirty, and internal sensors are still down.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we have this.

   [He takes out the life-signs detector.]

     SHEPPARD
     It can't differentiate between Wraith and human, but if we confine
     all base personnel to the designated areas, the blips that show up
     out of bounds will be the likely targets.

     EVERETT
     Let me see that.

     SHEPPARD
     It won't do you any good. You need the gene.

   [He shows Sheppard that it works for him.]

     EVERETT
     I got the gene therapy, too.

   [Teyla arrives with other Athosians.]

     TEYLA
     We wish to help. This is quite a large city, Colonel. You need as
     many people searching as possible.

     SHEPPARD
     She is the one who sensed the Wraith presence in the first place.

     EVERETT
     Captain. Get some weapons for these people.

     RADNER
     Yes, sir.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Beckett, McKay, and Zelenka arrive.]

     BECKETT
     There's other people on this base that possess the Ancient gene--Dr.
     Kusanagi, for example. I'm sure she'd relish the opportunity to
     help.

     MCKAY
     I am exhausted and starving, so sit down. Carson, it's out of
     drones. You couldn't do any damage if you wanted to.

   [Beckett sits in the chair and powers it up.]

     MCKAY

     Thank you. Okay, we're in business.
     (to Zelenka)
     Head down to the Jumper bay. Radio me when you get there.

   [Zelenka gets to work.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The scene shifts to the tower where the Wraith search is underway.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Using the life-signs detector, Everett leads his men on the search.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The scene shifts to another tower.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Teyla leads the Athosians on the search.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The scene shifts to another tower.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Ford searches alone. A Wraith soldier hides behind a column. When Ford
   walks past, the Wraith grabs Ford and throws him to the floor. The
   Wraith approaches Ford. Sheppard shoots it from behind, then shoots it
   again to make sure it's dead. Ford gets up.]

     SHEPPARD

     (looking at detector)
     You okay?

     FORD
     Yeah. How about next time, you can be the bait?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, maybe. Next time. All right, this way.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     TECHNICIAN
     We just received a response from the Genii.

     WEIR
     Let's hear it.

   [The Technician plays a recording.]

     PRENUM

     (audio)
     This is Prenum of the Genii. We welcome the opportunity to open a
     dialogue between our two people. Send your representative--one
     person, unarmed.

     WEIR
     Is that all?

     TECHNICIAN
     Yes, ma'am.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Colonel Everett, this is Weir. As we'd hoped, the Genii have asked
     us to send a representative. I'm set to go.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     EVERETT

     (into radio)
     Good. I can't imagine anyone more qualified. Pull this off, I'll buy
     you a drink.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     You've got a deal.
     (to Technician)
     Dial the gate.

   EXT--WORMHOLE

   INT--UNDERGROUND FACILITY, GENII HOMEWORLD

   INT--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM

   [Weir is led in blindfolded and made to sit in a chair. A Genii soldier
   steps forward to speak; she can't see him.]

     PRENUM
     Dr. Weir... I am Prenum of the Genii. I'm rather surprised. No,
     astonished that you would have the audacity to come here.

     WEIR
     You heard our message. The Wraith are at our doorstep.

     PRENUM
     And we are understandably delighted at the prospect of your demise.

     WEIR
     That may be so. But still, we have something that you want.

     PRENUM
     C4.

     WEIR
     More than that. We have an opportunity for you to test your weapon
     at no risk to yourselves, and a chance to strike at the Wraith. You
     have no idea how close they are.

     PRENUM

     (walking around her)
     The Wraith have come, Doctor. Six days ago. Fortunately, we detected
     their approach and we were able to shut down our reactors in time.
     Hundreds of lives were lost on the surface, but thousands more were
     saved because our underground complex went undetected. So, you see,
     the threat to the Genii has come and gone. So far as the Wraith are
     concerned, this planet is no longer of interest to them. We have the
     design that Dr. McKay provided for us, and our prototype bombs are
     nearly complete.

     WEIR
     So why would you ask me to come here?

     PRENUM
     So that we may trade the C4...for your life.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Everett and his mean hear gunfire and an explosion. He moves toward it
   and finds a solider down next to a damaged naquadah generator.]

     EVERETT

     Damn it.
     (into radio)
     This is Everett. The Wraith just took out one of our generators.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     SHEPPARD
     What's the nearest generator station?

     FORD
     Number three, but Teyla's group is closer.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Teyla?

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     TEYLA

     (into radio)
     We are already on our way, Major. We'll meet you there.

   INT--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM

     WEIR
     I have already offered you the C4.

     PRENUM
     And you want our prototype weapons in exchange. That's not a bargain
     for the Genii.

     WEIR
     What would you do if you had the C4 right now? Incorporate it into
     your weapons?

     PRENUM
     Yes.

     WEIR
     And you would test them.

     PRENUM
     Of course.

     WEIR
     I am offering you the chance to test your weapon design on a Wraith
     hive ship, at no risk to your own people, and still have enough to
     build dozens more. Now, if you are too proud or too stupid to see--

     PRENUM
     Be careful, Doctor.

     WEIR
     I am way past careful. Now, you know what the deal is, and it's a
     damn good one, so take it or leave it.

   INT--ATLANTIS PUDDLE JUMPER BAY

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Zelenka works on a panel of crystals.]

     ZELENKA

     (into radio)
     Yeah. That's it.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Okay... Let's give it a test.

     ZELENKA

     (over radio)
     Standing by.

     MCKAY
     Carson I need you to clear your mind and think about the Puddle
     Jumper. Think about bringing it online.

   [Carson concentrates in the chair.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     ZELENKA
     Come on, come on, come on...any time now.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     MCKAY
     Carson... Look, I know you can do this. Just activate the Puddle
     Jumper.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [The Jumper systems come alive.]

     ZELENKA

     (into radio)
     Yes! Yes! Yes! Rodney, Rodney it works!

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     MCKAY
     Thank God.

   [Beckett smiles. McKay sags in relief and sits on a step.]

   INT--ATLANTIS 'GATE ROOM

   [Weir comes through the Stargate with two Genii wheeling two large
   boxes.]

     WEIR

     (to guard)
     Give me your radio. Thank you.
     (into radio)
     This is Weir. I've got the prototypes.

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

   [Dozing, McKay hears Weir and wakes up.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Prototypes. Right.

   [He gets up and leaves; Beckett remains in the chair.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard and Teyla's teams are in a fierce firefight with several
   Wraith soldiers and a Wraith. They take them out with machine guns.
   Some of the Athosians fall.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that should be the last of them.

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

   [Weir finds Everett at her desk.]

     WEIR
     Colonel?

     EVERETT
     Well done, Doctor. I--I have to admit it, I am impressed.

     WEIR
     Well, maybe there's hope for me yet.

     EVERETT
     I'm in your chair.

   [He stands.]

     WEIR
     I thought it was your chair.

     EVERETT
     Yeah, well, I...I don't sit much. I was just going over the...

   [McKay enters.]

     MCKAY
     We have a problem.

     EVERETT
     We have a lot of problems.

     MCKAY
     I just finished examining the Genii nuclear devices. They're
     incomplete. I could finish it, but it's going to take time.

     EVERETT
     How much time?

     MCKAY
     About a day.

     EVERETT
     We don't have a day, Doctor.

     MCKAY
     Well, like I said, we have a problem.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [McKay and Zelenka work on the Genii bombs. Beckett enters.]

     BECKETT
     You want to see me, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Yes, yes. I need something to keep me awake.

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, me too.

     BECKETT
     I've already given you something.

     MCKAY
     We're building nuclear bombs here. Staying awake is sort of a
     prerequisite.

     BECKETT
     Snappy. All right. I'll get you another stimulant. Carry on.

     MCKAY
     Thank you.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Athosians move through the open Stargate.]

     EVERETT
     I'm sorry you lost some of your people.

     TEYLA
     Many have died, Colonel.

     PILOT

     (over radio)
     This is Jumper Four. We have a visual on the hive ships.

     EVERETT

     (into city-wide intercom)
     This is Everett. Jumper Four has just informed us the Wraith hive
     ships are approaching the planet. Defense team, to your positions.
     (to Weir)
     Doctor?

     WEIR

     Thank you.
     (into city-wide intercom)
     This is Weir. Now, I know how tired you all are, and how much we
     have asked of you these past few days. Hopefully, the Daedalus will
     arrive soon, but until that happens, our fate is in our own hands.
     If, during the course of this battle, that mission fails, I will
     give the order to evacuate. Now, we all hope it won't come to that,
     but if it does...don't hesitate. That is all.

   [As she speaks, all the base personnel prepare their positions.]

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [McKay fastens a cover on the bomb.]

     FORD
     Time's up.

     MCKAY

     Oh, what a coincidence. We're done.
     (leaning over in exhaustion)
     Oh...

     ZELENKA
     So...chair room?

     MCKAY
     Right.

   [The wheel the bombs out.]

     RADNER

     (into radio)
     Colonel. We're heading into the bay to load up the Jumpers.

     EVERETT

     (over radio)
     Understood.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     EVERETT

     (to Weir)
     Remember...I owe you that drink.

   INT--ATLANTIS PUDDLE JUMPER BAY

   [The men wheel the bomb aboard the Jumper.]

     ZELENKA
     Slow. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Right here.

   ships.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   ships.]

     WEIR

     They're sending in another wave! Major, we need to go!

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   [The Darts descend on the city in a swarm. The Atlantis defense teams
   fire. A Dart is hit and crashes into the ocean.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     McKay!

     MCKAY
     There's something wrong. Power levels are dropping!

   INT--ATLANTIS PUDDLE JUMPER BAY

     ZELENKA

     (into radio)
     Rodney, nothing is happening.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The display shows many ships on top of the city.]

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Why are there no jumpers in the air?

     MCKAY

     (over radio)
     We must have exhausted the Mark II's energy output. It's dead!

   INT--ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     So long, Rodney.

   [Sheppard gets up and runs out.]

     MCKAY

     There's got to be a way to...
     (seeing Sheppard is gone)
     Major!

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Everett leads a team. Wraith cause visual illusions.]

     EVERETT
     Heads up, people! They're in the base.

   [Elsewhere, Sheppard runs toward the control room.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Colonel, we have a problem.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     EVERETT

     (into radio)
     What is it?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     We may need to give the order to evacuate.

   [Sheppard comes running through and starts up the stairs to the Jumper
   bay.]

     SHEPPARD
     Elizabeth, wait!

     WEIR
     You can't.

     SHEPPARD
     I have to, and you know it.

     WEIR
     John... Go.

   [Sheppard nods and runs up the stairs.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     What's the status on that damn jumper?

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     It's on its way.

     I'm aware of that, Dr. Zelenka. Start prepping Jumper Two.

     Teyla, I'm hearing gunfire. What's your status? Teyla, do you hear
     me? Teyla?

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

     Hopefully, if I take this one out, the other one will back off.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [The 'gate is active for evacuation.]

     BECKETT
     Go, go, go, go! We can't stay here, Elizabeth.

   [ Beckett encourages some people through, then runs up the stairs to
   the control room.]

     MCKAY
     He's right, they're beaming in all over the place.

     WEIR
     We're not going anywhere. Not yet.

   the red enemy ships.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     Understood.

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY

   [Ford leads a team.]

     FORD
     Come on. Keep up! Over there.

   [Via a culling beam, five Wraith appear just in front of Ford and his
   team. More appear behind them.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay watches the display.]

     MCKAY
     You let Sheppard fly that jumper?

   [Weir meets his gaze. He turns away.]

     WEIR
     Help me arm the self-destruct in case this fails.

   [Weir and McKay enter their pass-codes. Beckett watches the Jumper
   approach the hives on the display. The self-destruct countdown alarm
   sounds. McKay looks disturbed and sad.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     They haven't detected my approach. The weapon is armed and ready...
     I'm going in.
