   TEASER

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Sheppard's team eats their meals together in the crowded mess hall.]

     MCKAY
     Let me ask you a question. Say there's a runaway train. It's
     hurtling out of control towards ten people standing in the middle of
     the tracks. Only way to save those people is to flip a switch, send
     the train down another set of tracks. The only problem is--there is
     a baby in the middle of those tracks.

     TEYLA
     Why would anyone leave a baby in harm's way like that?

     MCKAY
     Well, I-I don't know. That's not the point. It's an ethical dilemma.
     Look, Katie Brown brought it up over dinner the other night.
     Question is: is it appropriate to divert the train and kill the one
     baby to save the ten people?

     RONON
     Wouldn't the people just see the train coming and move?

     MCKAY
     No. No, they wouldn't see it.

     RONON
     Why not?

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     Well, look, I don't know. Say they're blind.

     TEYLA
     All of them?

     MCKAY

     (getting annoyed)
     Yes. All of them.

     RONON
     Then why don't you just call out and tell them to move out of the
     way?

     MCKAY
     Oh, because they can't hear you.

     SHEPPARD
     What, they're deaf too? How fast is the train going?

     MCKAY

     (exasperated)
     Look, the speed doesn't matter!

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, sure it does. If it's going slow enough, you could...outrun it
     and shove everyone to the side.

     RONON
     Or better yet, go get the baby.

   [Ronon and Sheppard exchange agreeing nods before Sheppard takes a bite
   of his orange.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, for god's sake, I was just trying to--

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Rodney...?

     MCKAY
     Wh-yes. Go ahead.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Major Lorne just dialed in from M4D-058. He says he's got something
     you'll want to see.

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

   [He stands and starts to leave.]

     MCKAY

     (to team)
     Work it out.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay and Sheppard stand with Weir looking at a monitor which shows
   Lorne crouched low by a wall.]

     LORNE

     (over video)
     We came through the space gate and immediately noticed a bunch of
     small satellites in geo-synchronous orbit above the planet.

     WEIR

     (into radio)
     An advanced civilization?

     LORNE

     (over video)
     That's what we thought. Then we picked up life signs directly below,
     so we flew down--saw several villages separated by a large river and
     decided to check one of them out. And as you can see...
     (to sergeant off-camera)
     Sergeant...?

   [The sergeant moves the camera to show the village below the wall. The
   people are using wooden wheelbarrows and simple tools as they go about
   their daily business.]

     LORNE

     (continuing, over video)
     These people...don't exactly look like they're ready to be launching
     any satellites, at least not for the next five hundred years or so.

     SHEPPARD
     Ancients probably put them up there.

     MCKAY

     (agreeing)
     Mmm.

     WEIR

     (to McKay, but heard on radio)
     Send a science team to check it out.

   [Lorne, now back on camera, looks amused.]

     LORNE

     (over video)
     Uh, actually...I think Doctor McKay may want to come check this one
     out for himself.

     MCKAY
     Why?

     LORNE
     Take a look.

   [The off-camera sergeant pans the camera again and zooms its focus onto
   a small banner hanging from a building. It has a red stripe on each
   side of the banner, and in the white center is a picture of McKay's
   face.]

   [Weir, Sheppard and McKay stare at the image in shock. Sheppard bites
   his lip as he and McKay exchange looks--as if they know something about
   this after all and also know they're in trouble.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

   [Weir storms into her office, McKay and Sheppard following.]

     WEIR

     (furious)
     How the hell did your face get on that flag?!

     MCKAY
     Oh, uh, I don't know.

   [Weir stares from McKay to Sheppard, aware they know more to this than
   they're saying.]

     MCKAY

     (perplexed)
     Wai-wait. Here's the thing though. That flag's very similar to the
     one I designed in our game.

     SHEPPARD

     (snappish)
     It's exactly like the one you designed in our game.

     WEIR
     What game?

     SHEPPARD
     The game Rodney and I have been playing.

     MCKAY

     (innocently)
     Yeah, we didn't tell you about the game?

     SHEPPARD
     We've been playing for a while now.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, off and on in our spare time--you know, uh, at night, between
     missions, I could've sworn we told you about it.

     WEIR

     (impatient)
     What. Game?

     MCKAY
     Well, it started a while ago...

   FLASHBACK

   INT--"GAME" ROOM, ATLANTIS

   [McKay and a science team enter the room. The control panels light up.]

     MCKAY

     (voiceover)
     Uh, a few months after we arrived here, we were exploring the city,
     checking out some labs on the East Pier when we discovered a room.
     There were several Ancient consoles and screens. It was quite an
     impressive layout. As usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we
     entered.

   [McKay goes to a monitor, which shows a landscape with a winding
   river.]

     MCKAY

     (voiceover)
     At first, we thought it was some kind of a geological facility.
     There was a screen with a map that we assumed was of the Lantian
     mainland.

   END FLASHBACK

     WEIR
     Yes, I remember you briefing me about that.

     MCKAY
     Right, there you go. We did tell you.

     WEIR
     You mentioned nothing about a game, though.

     SHEPPARD
     That's because at first we didn't know what it was....

   FLASHBACK

   INT--GAME ROOM

   [McKay sits at one of the panels. He punches controls and pulls up more
   menus on the screen.]

     SHEPPARD

     (continuing)
     Then, Rodney studied it more closely. He realized it wasn't a
     geological lab at all.

     MCKAY

     (voiceover)
     No, it turns out, it was it was in fact a-a-a kind of a...Ancient
     game room. The map was of a fictional civilization. It was part of a
     simulated world.

   [The McKay in the flashback grins at his find.]

     MCKAY
     Sweet!

   END FLASHBACK

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, what you do, is you take these countries that are already in a
     database and you assume control of them.

     MCKAY
     Two societies, separated by a river straight down the middle.
     Sheppard took one country, I took the other.

     SHEPPARD
     First thing Rodney did, besides renaming his country, is put his
     face all over the flag.

   [Sheppard chuckles and rolls his eyes. McKay also chuckles and grins.
   Weir looks very unamused.]

     WEIR
     I think you need to check this planet out.

   [McKay and Sheppard's grins fade. Abashed, they leave.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A puddle jumper comes through the space gate and flies around
   M4D-058.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     TEYLA
     So...the Ancestors created this game?

     MCKAY
     Yes, but this is no ordinary game. I mean, it is incredibly
     challenging, instructional...I mean the sheer number of options
     built into it? Staggering.

     TEYLA
     How does one play it?

     SHEPPARD
     You gotta figure out the best way to run your country.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, you build roads, you, uh, establish laws, mold it to your own
     specific ideology.

   FLASHBACK

   INT--GAME ROOM

   [Sheppard and McKay sit across from each other, each with a computer in
   front of them. Their monitors show the river landscape. Sheppard looks
   over at Rodney's side as if trying to guess what he's doing.]

     MCKAY

     (voiceover)
     You can control everything. Proper sanitation systems, water
     delivery.

     SHEPPARD

     (voiceover)
     Transportation...

     MCKAY

     (voiceover)
     I mean, every detail can be manipulated...I mean, right down to the
     women's hairstyles.

   [On McKay's computer, he pulls up a computer image of a woman avatar.
   She wears a white dress with red trim, but there are other options. She
   has shoulder length red hair and green eyes. McKay changes the hair to
   blond and short.]

     MCKAY
     Hello there.

   END FLASHBACK

     RONON
     So how do you win this game?

     SHEPPARD
     It's not really about winning.

   FLASHBACK

   INT--GAME ROOM

   [McKay and Sheppard study information on their respective monitors.
   They peer over their monitor to look at each other.]

     MCKAY

     (voiceover)
     Yeah, it's more about whose society outshines the other's. I mean,
     who creates a better infrastructure.

   END FLASHBACK

     MCKAY

     (continuing, smugly)
     ...who's better at trade.

   [Sheppard glares at McKay.]

     MCKAY

     (innocently)
     What? Hey, don't start. I tried to negotiate with you.

     SHEPPARD
     Making a list of demands and not giving anything in return is not
     negotiating.

     MCKAY
     I offered you an entire crop of beans.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't need beans, I need lumber.

     MCKAY
     Oh, right, to build defensive fortifications for your army, which he
     doubled in size, by the way. Surprise, surprise.

   [They glance back, making their arguments to Ronon and Teyla, who look
   equally amused and bemused by the conversation.]

     SHEPPARD
     I only did that after you started cheating.

     MCKAY
     I did not cheat!

     SHEPPARD
     He's giving his people way too much technology for their level of
     development. I'm not the only one increasing my army, by the way.

     MCKAY
     I had to do something to protect the people of Geldar from you.

     RONON
     Geldar?

     SHEPPARD
     It's the name of Rodney's country. He named it after a girl he
     stalked in college.

     MCKAY
     I did not stalk her. We dated...twice. Theresa Geldar. Very cute
     blonde. I always used to think her name reminded me of some kind of
     a...mythological land: the kingdom of Geldar.

   [Teyla smiles, then taps Sheppard on the arm.]

     TEYLA
     What'd you call your country?

     SHEPPARD

     (shrugging)
     Well, I...just...kept the name it already had.

   [The HUD pulls up an image of a hundred satellites in a square pattern,
   floating over the planet.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, there are the satellites.

     TEYLA
     Dozens of them.

     MCKAY
     Positioned directly above the continent. Perfect grid. Ten-by-ten.
     Should have a visual on one of them...

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper approaches a satellite.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     RONON
     Definitely looks Ancient.

     MCKAY
     Huh. And active. It's transmitting a tremendous amount of data.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, let's check it out.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper flies down to the surface of M4D-058.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [A couple watch a primitive version of a movie on a cylindrical wheel;
   it shows an animation of a man who has his head pop off and go back on.
   Other vendors sell telescopes and other science equipment. Sheppard's
   team walks among the crowd. The villagers who spot McKay stop what
   they're doing and stare at him. Many of the women in the village have
   short blond hair.]

     MCKAY
     This is amazing!

     RONON
     If you say so.

   [A man drives by on an early version of a bicycle, with a large front
   wheel and smaller rear one.]

     SHEPPARD

     (sarcastic)
     Oh, yeah. That's something you see in every medieval village.

     MCKAY
     Yes, well, the...Renaissance obviously came early to these folks.

     SHEPPARD
     What, a couple hundred years early?

   [More and more of the crowd have noticed McKay and have started
   whispering to each other. The team notices their interest and begins to
   feel uncomfortable under the scrutiny.]

     TEYLA
     Um...Rodney?

   [Ronon picks up a tricked-out crossbow on a vendor's table and studies
   it as the crowd seems to watch with awe--their attention stuck on
   McKay. He stares back at them, bewildered, not noticing he's standing
   under a painting of...himself in the same pose, complete with jacket
   with the Canadian flag patch. The painting has a halo over McKay's
   head. Nola begins to approach. Sheppard looks from the painting to
   McKay, nonplussed.]

     SHEPPARD

     (whispering harshly to McKay)
     Say something!

     MCKAY

     (low, to Sheppard)
     Like what?

     SHEPPARD

     (low, to McKay)
     I don't know!

     NOLA
     Hello. I am Nola.

     MCKAY
     Yes, well, uh...this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, Teyla
     Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and I'm...McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay.

   [He flashes Nola, who is an attractive young woman with short blond
   hair, a charming smile. Nola steps forward and studies McKay's features
   intently, glancing up to the portrait behind him.]

     SHEPPARD
     The resemblance is...uncanny.

   [McKay glances back, finally seeing the portrait.]

     NOLA

     (awed)
     You are the Oracle!

     MCKAY
     The Oracle?

   [Nola steps back and bows deeply. All the villagers follow suit.]

     NOLA
     Welcome to Geldar.

   [McKay looks shocked, and guilty. Sheppard shoots him a narrow look.]

   INT--PORTAL BUILDING CORRIDOR

   [Nola leads the team down a stone corridor.]

     NOLA
     Please forgive my nervousness. I never thought you'd appear to us in
     the flesh.

     TEYLA
     Why do you refer to him as "the Oracle"?

   [Nola looks to McKay for permission to speak, he shrugs and waves his
   hand.]

     NOLA
     The Oracle is a wise and omnipotent deity.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Ronon)
     Boy, she's in for a rude awakening.

     NOLA
     Thousands of years ago, he gave our ancestors life. He instructed
     them how to build their society, how to live their lives. His
     guidance was revered by all. Then one day, without warning, the
     Oracle ceased all communications.

     RONON

     (to Sheppard)
     War with the Wraith.

   [Sheppard nods in agreement.]

     NOLA
     Our people were puzzled by this, but they continued to adhere to his
     instructions, living their lives according to his teachings which
     they passed down from generation to generation.

   [They pass more portraits of McKay.]

     TEYLA
     Have you not had any trouble with the Wraith?

     NOLA
     Yes. They've come periodically--culled our people, destroyed our
     villages. Those who survived rebuilt, but only to the level at which
     the Oracle had instructed before he left. We found ourselves stalled
     in our development, unwilling to push forward without the Oracle's
     guidance, hoping one day he would return to us. And two years ago,
     he did. The Oracle resumed communicating with us, teaching us many
     new things. He challenged us to think, to push the limit of our
     scientific endeavors. He changed the name of our country, and even
     revealed his likeness to us.

   [McKay grins smugly at yet another portrait. Sheppard shakes his head
   in disgust.]

     SHEPPARD
     Enough with the pictures.

   INT--PORTAL CHAMBER

   [McKay looks down over a balcony to the floor below, where people work
   around an Ancient device that shows a map of the continent, similar to
   that of the game.]

     MCKAY
     Ah, and you communicate through that.

     NOLA
     The portal, yes.

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [The team heads down the stairs to the console.]

     NOLA
     It's through this that we receive our instructions.

     TEYLA
     And the Oracle knows when you've carried them out?

     NOLA
     Yes.

     MCKAY
     It's the satellites! They must be tracking everything that's going
     on and then relaying it via subspace back to Atlantis. It's
     remarkable!

     RONON
     So, not a game after all.

     MCKAY
     No, it's obviously some kind of, uh, Ancient experiment, uh, social
     development, to try out different ways to create civilizations.

   [Sheppard points to the symbol of an area on the other side of the
   river.]

     SHEPPARD
     This country here...?

     NOLA
     Hallona.

   [Sheppard preens.]

     NOLA
     A persistent thorn in our side.

   [Sheppard's face falls.]

     NOLA

     (to McKay)
     Now that you've come to us, you can help us remove it.

   [Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DUSK

   INT--GAME ROOM

   [Zelenka, Lorne, and Weir stand in front of the console.]

     WEIR
     So this is it?

     ZELENKA

     (awed)
     Yes. Yes, it is an amazing piece of technology. It appears to be a
     sociological experiment designed by the Ancients to help them as
     they were seeding various civilizations throughout Pegasus. I-I've
     had a chance to look at it further, and it-it's interesting, there
     are many more civilizations in the game's database.

     WEIR
     Really? I thought Rodney said there were only two.

     ZELENKA
     That's what he thought. The actual countries that he and Colonel
     Sheppard are controlling are on this specific planet, but I've been
     able to access the codes to unlock additional levels to the
     game...I-I mean, to the ex-experiment. I discovered countries on-on
     planets throughout the galaxy. Some have been idle for the past ten
     thousand years, I guess awaiting instructions from the Ancients, but
     some have managed to develop on their own, even flourish. Some have
     been destroyed by war, and others have been...completely wiped out.
     Er, not that R-Rodney's and Colonel Sheppard's societies are on this
     path.

   [They stare at the civilizations shown on the monitor.]

     WEIR

     (concerned)
     So much power at one's fingertips.

     ZELENKA

     (enchanted)
     It's amazing the attraction of this...game.

   [Weir shoots him a worried look.]

   INT--GELDAR VILLAGE SQUARE

   [Nola sits at an outdoor table with McKay. Helkin unfurls a blueprint
   for a dirigible.]

     NOLA
     We've managed to achieve propulsion through hand powered propellers,
     but now we're undertaking tests of steam-powered propulsion.

     MCKAY
     Oh.

     HELKIN
     Only this morning, I completed a test that proved quite promising.

     MCKAY

     (nonplussed)
     Really, that's great.

     NOLA

     (anxious)
     You're pleased?

     MCKAY
     Yes. Yes! I mean, this is quite an achievement.

   [The rest of McKay's teammates arrive with a man dressed in chain mail,
   Baden. The villagers watch warily as he approaches. Nola stands when
   she spots Baden, looking angry.]

     NOLA
     What's he doing here?

     BADEN
     It wasn't my idea.

   [A bewildered McKay looks between them.]

     SHEPPARD
     Doctor Rodney McKay, meet Baden.

     MCKAY

     (disdainfully)
     Oh, your guy.

     SHEPPARD
     My guy.

     MCKAY
     Eh, it figures.

     NOLA
     I should have you arrested for trespassing.

     BADEN
     Go ahead and try.

     SHEPPARD
     Easy now. I brought him here because we need to have a little
     discussion.

     NOLA
     I have nothing to say to him.

     BADEN
     Fine with me.

   [He turns to leave, but Ronon blocks his path, looking menacing.]

     SHEPPARD
     Eh, maybe not. But we definitely have something to say to you.

   [Later, they all sit around the table.]

     SHEPPARD
     So, his story's pretty much the same as Nola's. His ancestors
     received instructions from their Oracle, who disappeared for
     thousands of years, only to suddenly resume communicating a few
     years ago.

     MCKAY

     (snidely)
     Let me guess, he told you to double the size of your army.

     SHEPPARD

     (snidely)
     Yes, he has a capable army...and some nice villages. No people
     riding bicycles or hot air balloons, because we weren't cheating!

     MCKAY
     I didn't cheat!

     NOLA
     Have you come to agree to our trade proposals?

     BADEN
     You mean demands? Never.

     NOLA

     (standing)
     Then I refuse to sit at the same table...

     MCKAY

     (quickly)
     Look, look, please sit.

   [Nola complies.]

     MCKAY
     Thank you.

     TEYLA
     This...hostility between you. Have your people lived like this for
     thousands of years?

     NOLA
     No. There was once peace between our lands.

     MCKAY

     (with regret)
     Oh, no.

     SHEPPARD

     (hesitantly)
     So this...hostility...um...did it start a few years ago.

     NOLA
     Yes. Shortly after the Oracle resumed communicating with us.

   [Sheppard and McKay exchange sheepish looks; Teyla and Ronon exchange
   glances.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

   [Weir has left Zelenka and Lorne, who are studying the readout of a
   civilization.]

     LORNE
     So...they're starving?

     ZELENKA
     Well, not as of yet, but if they don't change their approach to
     agriculture, it won't be too long before many of their people go
     hungry. The frustrating thing is, there is a large piece of fertile
     soil in the south of the country that would be idea for a tuber
     cultivation, you know?

     LORNE
     Sorry, "tuber"?

     ZELENKA
     Tuber, yeah, tuber. It, eh, it is, uh, indigenous to the planet.
     It's like a potato.

     LORNE
     So why didn't you just say "potato"?

     ZELENKA
     Because it's not a potato! It's-it's...it's...larger...it-it-it has
     the same texture and nutrients as a potato, but...it's...like a
     cantaloupe.

     LORNE
     That's a pretty big potato.

     ZELENKA
     Uh-huh. It is a big potato.

     LORNE
     So, if they plant this thing there, it'll grow?

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, oh yes. Oh, whole fields of it. I mean, they could sustain an
     entire village, but...they're oblivious to it.

     LORNE
     Then tell them...anonymously. Oh, come on, Doc. You can either stand
     here and let the people die, or you can...help them out. Sounds like
     a no-brainer to me.

   [Zelenka considers this.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [Nola, Baden, Helkin, and others stand around the terminal with the
   Atlantis team.]

     MCKAY
     As soon as we input the instructions into our console, they
     are...relayed back to this device by a number of satellites in orbit
     over your planet. Once you've carried out the instructions, the
     satellites transmit the real-time results back to us on our
     homeworld.

     NOLA

     (upset and confused)
     So...you're saying this is a game?

   [McKay looks from Nola to Baden who looks equally disturbed.]

     MCKAY
     No...no. Uh-uh, well...we thought it was a game, but, uh...

     SHEPPARD
     We didn't know there were real people on the other end.

     BADEN
     You are the Oracle?

     SHEPPARD
     I'm your Oracle, yes...That doesn't sound right.

     TEYLA
     I-I know this is difficult to absorb, but...it is all true.

     RONON
     You flew in the puddle jumper; you know they have the technology.

     BADEN
     I'm not listening to this.

   [He starts to leave. Sheppard stops him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hold on a sec, now. We can prove it to you.

     BADEN
     How?

     SHEPPARD
     Let's go for a ride.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Weir and a security contingent are already in the control room as
   Sheppard's team, Baden, and Nola come down the stairwell from the
   jumper bay.]

     SHEPPARD
     Baden, Nola, this is Doctor Weir, leader of our expedition.

     WEIR
     Welcome to Atlantis. If these two gentlemen haven't done so already,
     let me please offer you our sincerest apologies for this intrusion
     into your lives.

   [Baden and Nola wander to the inner balcony of the control room.]

     SHEPPARD

     (protesting)
     "Intrusion?"

     MCKAY
     An imposition, maybe...and a benevolent one at that! I mean, if you
     could've seen the villages now compared to the way they were when we
     started--

     WEIR
     Rodney! Now, why don't you take them to your "game" room? Show them
     what you two've been up to?

     MCKAY
     Right. Shall we?

   [McKay leads them away.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

   [McKay shows a computer display to Nola and Baden. Sheppard is nearby.]

     MCKAY

     So...this is Geldar, and this is Hallona. Look, two weeks ago I
     instructed you to start digging a well for the new settlement on the
     eastern slope, and...look here.
     (typing on computer)
     There, see? Construction's already begun.

   [McKay looks up, proud. Nola looks at the display, stunned.]

     NOLA

     Yes. I gave the order myself.
     (upset)
     Our lives are just a game.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, now, no! They're not games to you, and, in our defense, we
     were trying to improve your lives.

     MCKAY
     It's like he said, everything we did, every instruction we gave was
     to better conditions for your people.

     SHEPPARD

     (low voice)
     And if that meant cheating...

     MCKAY
     Okay, you know, enough with that already!

   [Baden watches everything. Nola just stares in despair.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS GUEST QUARTERS

   [Nola sits stiffly on the bed. McKay stands nearby.]

     MCKAY
     Is the room...okay?

     NOLA

     (blankly)
     It's fine.

     MCKAY
     Well then, if you, uh, if you need anything at all...don't hesitate
     to ask, okay? You hungry? 'Cause-cause, we could, uh, walk across to
     the mess hall. They've got, um, I think it's, uh, salisbury steak
     today? It's very good. They have-they have a gravy they put on
     the-on the steak part, and, uh...

   [McKay's voice trails off into silence.]

     NOLA

     (upset)
     The Oracle was a god to us! I believed in his teachings--so much so
     that my people elected me leader because of my passion for
     scientific advancement.

     MCKAY
     Well, they-they obviously made the right choice.

     NOLA
     Now I must resolve myself to the fact...that the Oracle is only a
     man.

     MCKAY

     (contrite)
     Yeah. Sorry about that. So...it's like I said though, I...I did what
     I did with the best of intentions.

     NOLA

     (bitter)
     To win a game.

   [McKay rushes over and sits next to her.]

     MCKAY
     No! No-no. It is not about winning or losing. Look, the information
     I gave you and your people is very real, very useful! I've set you
     on a course that will allow you to develop into a-into a modern
     society. I mean, where were you two years ago, huh? You were a
     primitive, disparate cluster of villages stalled in development. Now
     you're making dirigibles! Do you have any idea how momentous that
     is?

     NOLA
     The Oracle once said: "Ask not what Geldar can do for you, but what
     you can do for Geldar." Those were your words.

     MCKAY

     (uncomfortable)
     Um...give or take.

     NOLA
     They are very wise.

     MCKAY

     (looking away)
     Yes. Yes, they are.

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Sheppard and Baden sit in the empty mess hall.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, now that you know the truth, uh, you can go back to living
     your own lives, and we won't...bother you anymore.

     BADEN
     No. You must still help us.

     SHEPPARD
     You don't need our help. You'll be fine.

     BADEN
     We need more weapons. The flying machine you brought us here
     in...you called it a "puddle jumper". Our army could use it.

     SHEPPARD

     (uncomfortable, but firm)
     No. Can't do that.

     BADEN
     But you encouraged me to increase the military.

     SHEPPARD
     In response to McKay...the other Oracle doing things that I thought
     were, uh...

     BADEN
     Aggressive? Arrogant? Demeaning to me and my people?!

     SHEPPARD
     I-I will give you arrogant and demeaning, but uh...

     BADEN
     The people of Geldar have started digging a mine beneath our borders
     to exploit coal resources on our land!

     SHEPPARD

     (leaning forward, intrigued)
     Really?

     BEDEN
     It was only confirmed yesterday. This after several diplomatic
     attempts to reach a compromise.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, we couldn't come to an agreement, but-but I didn't think he
     would start digging.

     BEDEN
     I'm curious to know what response you would have to such an
     incursion. I believe your next command would be to launch an attack
     on the mine. Prevent them from digging further? I'm right, aren't I?

   [Sheppard fidgets, but doesn't deny it.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [McKay and Sheppard walk with Weir.]

     WEIR
     Did they believe you?

     MCKAY
     Yes, they are fully aware of the situation--not too thrilled,
     obviously.

     SHEPPARD
     We've got a big problem, though.

     WEIR

     (sighing)
     What is it?

     SHEPPARD
     Game or no game, the fact remains, we've started something these
     people don't seem to want to stop. They hate each other and may be
     headed for a very real...war.

   [Weir stops short.]

     WEIR

     (sarcastic)
     Great. Great. And this is thanks to your..."benevolent imposition"?

   [She storms off.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Weir sits at the center table. Nola sits at one of the side tables,
   Baden at an opposite one.]

     WEIR
     I've asked you both here this morning so we can have a face-to-face
     talk. Now, hopefully, I can help you reach an understanding.

     NOLA
     Where is Doctor McKay?

     WEIR
     Well, I've asked that neither he nor Colonel Sheppard participate in
     this. I think they've already done enough in fostering the current
     tension between you. Now, I have had some experience brokering peace
     treaties; I'm sure we can find some common ground.

   [Nola and Baden look resistant, and say nothing.]

     WEIR
     Okay...why don't we start by going back a few years, to the time
     when your two peoples lived in peace?

     NOLA
     We were naive back then--ignorant to our potential. Once we began to
     challenge ourselves intellectually, we began to see how the people
     of Hallona had been abusing thousands of years of kindness from us.

     BADEN
     I've done everything I could to achieve peace with you.

     NOLA
     Really? Such as?

     BADEN
     I sent gifts of good will.

     NOLA
     You sent crates of citrus fruit. Citrus! Do you have any idea what
     an insult that is to my people?!

     BEDEN
     It didn't used to be.

     WEIR
     Okay, see, I think I know where that comes from. Did..."the
     Oracle"...tell you that citrus fruit was bad?

     NOLA
     He made us aware of its toxic properties, yes.

   [Weir opens her mouth to respond, but Baden cuts in.]

     BADEN
     Everything is toxic to you! If they're not busy insulting us,
     they're complaining about contaminated food, improper hygiene. Even
     the sunlight is dangerous to them!

   [Weir nods in understanding, but can't break into the conversation.]

     NOLA
     The only insult has been your unwillingness to compromise in any
     trade negotiation. Instead, you choose to increase the size of your
     army.

     BADEN
     You built an army, too!

     NOLA
     Only in response to your aggression.

     BADEN
     My aggression? You dig a mine beneath our border to steal our coal,
     and you have the nerve to talk about aggression?!

     NOLA
     We're not stealing your co--

     BADEN
     You crossed into our land!

     NOLA
     What do you need it for anyway? It's not like you know the first
     thing about what to do with it!

     BADEN
     You see how she insults us?

     NOLA

     (cuttingly)
     By stating a fact!

     WEIR
     Okay, please! If we could discuss this reasonably, I'm sure we can
     come to some sort of--

     NOLA
     We've tried! They agree to nothing. And until Doctor McKay is
     brought into this discussion, I have nothing further to say.

   [Nola leaves. Baden shrugs helplessly and also leaves. Weir sits
   alone.]

     WEIR

     (to herself)
     That went well.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Weir talks with Sheppard and McKay as they head down a corridor.]

     WEIR
     Talk to them. Get them back to the table and hammer out a truce. I
     have run into a roadblock.

     MCKAY

     (surprised)
     Really? Nola seemed very agreeable.

     SHEPPARD

     (snidely)
     To you.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, well more agreeable than "Richard the Lionheart".

     WEIR
     They are both refusing to compromise. You seem to have convinced
     them that they can't make any decisions without your guidance!

     SHEPPARD
     That's not true!

     WEIR

     (sighing, frustrated)
     Tell them that!

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Nola tries a bowl of blue Jell-O for the first time. McKay sits across
   the table from her.]

     NOLA
     This is delicious!

     MCKAY
     Listen, you need to make peace with the people of Hallona. If-if
     tensions keep rising like this, it could lead to war.

     NOLA

     (nodding, somber)
     I'm aware of that.

     MCKAY
     Well, then you're also aware that people will get hurt.

     NOLA
     I know the danger to my people. I also know you've taught us things
     Baden's band of knuckle-draggers won't learn for hundreds of years.

     MCKAY

     (preening)
     Huh. Well...

     NOLA
     Under your leadership, we hope to remain many steps ahead of any
     kind of aggression from them.

     MCKAY
     Nola, you and your people need to start thinking for yourselves.
     Look, I'm not going to be there for you anymore. You need to-to take
     control of your own lives, start making your own decisions about
     your future. And there can be no future without peace.

     NOLA
     I agree.

     MCKAY
     Good.

     NOLA
     And as soon as the people of Hallona either concede or get out of
     our way, peace will be restored. What you told me before, I do
     realize how monumental our progress has been, and I refuse to let
     Baden destroy that. "Great spirits have always encountered
     opposition from mediocre minds." Those are the words of the Oracle.
     You words.

     MCKAY

     (uncomfortable)
     Einstein's, actually, but...

     NOLA
     If we yield one bit to Hallona, it will be equal to taking a giant
     step back in our development. I owe it to my people to make sure
     that does not happen.

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     Hmm.

   INT--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

   [Sheppard and Baden study a display.]

     BADEN
     They're digging further. Every hour, they intrude deeper into our
     land.

     SHEPPARD
     To get them to stop, you have to provide an incentive.

     BADEN
     Like attacking the mine?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that'll cause a whole 'nother set of problems.

     BADEN
     The only problems will be with the people of Geldar.

     SHEPPARD
     Not necessarily. They can fight back.

     BADEN
     What are you saying? We should capitulate? Let them do whatever they
     want?

     SHEPPARD
     No, you make a deal. Trade. Say...you decide to share some of your
     weaponry, and they in turn, give you some of their technology.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     John?

   [Sheppard turns his back on Baden and walks to a corner of the room to
   converse in private.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     How's it going?

   [While Sheppard speaks, Baden notices his inattention and hurriedly
   types some commands into the computer connected to his home-world.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Well...he's being a little...uh...

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Stubborn?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I was going to use a different word.

   [Baden finishes and steps back, trying to look innocent. The computer
   beeps its acceptance of the commands. Sheppard overhears the computer
   beep and stiffens.]

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     Hmm.

   [Sheppard turns and studies Baden suspiciously. Baden pretends to look
   oblivious as he stands several feet back, studying the computer screen
   with interest.]

     WEIR

     (over radio)
     I'd like you to come to my office. We need to talk.

   INT--WEIR'S OFFICE

   [McKay and Sheppard sit in the chairs in front of Weir's desk.]

     WEIR
     They're not open to any kind of deal?

     SHEPPARD
     Not yet. Maybe we should stick them in a room, force them to come to
     an agreement.

     MCKAY

     (blithely)
     Don't worry about it, they'll work it out. Look, we just happened to
     catch them at a particularly bad time. Sheppard's guy's been doing a
     lot of aggressive posturing of late.

     SHEPPARD
     The only aggression is coming from the people of "Gelding".

     MCKAY
     Geldar.

     SHEPPARD
     Whatever! His people are digging a mine across the border into
     Hallona.

   [Weir looks expectantly at McKay, who looks guilty.]

     MCKAY

     (defensively)
     The coal resources straddle the border between my country and his.

     SHEPPARD
     Barely! They go three miles into my country, which your people are
     happily tunneling into.

     MCKAY
     It has been a point of contention between us, okay? But it is just
     a-a difference in cartographic interpretation. "To-may-to,
     to-mah-to."

     SHEPPARD
     No, no. It's pretty clear cut. You entered illegally into my
     country.

     WEIR
     Gentlemen--

     MCKAY
     You gave me no choice! You refused to negotiate!

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, you mean give in.

     MCKAY
     What do you care, anyway? It's not like your people are going to use
     the coal!

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, oh yeah, that's right. You need it to power your medieval steam
     engines!

     MCKAY
     We--

     WEIR

     (standing, furious)
     Stop it! These are not your lands! This "game" is over, so you'd
     better set aside your differences. Because if the two of you can't
     figure out how to forge a truce, how the hell are these people going
     to?

     ZELENKA

     (over radio)
     Rodney?

     MCKAY

     (peeved, into radio)
     What?!

     ZELENKA

     (over radio)
     You'd better come to the game room.

   INT--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

   [Weir, McKay and Sheppard join Zelenka in the room.]

     WEIR
     What happened?

     ZELENKA
     We've just received a data stream from the planet.

   [Sheppard sits at a terminal. It shows several Hallona troops
   descending on Geldar people at the mine entrance.]

     ZELENKA
     Colonel Sheppard's army has launched an attack.

   [McKay and Weir glare at Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD

     (innocent)
     Well don't look at me! I didn't order it!

   [As McKay studies his screen, the red Geldar people retreat. The blue
   Hallonans surround the mine entrance.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, they're going after the mine!

     WEIR
     Well...looks like your war just started.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

   [Nola and Baden, with their security escort, have now joined the
   others.]

     SHEPPARD
     Who ordered this?

     BADEN
     I did.

     MCKAY
     He entered the command on your game console.

     BADEN
     I only did it because I know it was something you would've told me
     to do.

     SHEPPARD
     I ordered you to make peace with these people!

     NOLA
     This attack will not go unpunished!

     WEIR
     No one is doing any punishing! There'll be no further escalation to
     this conflict.

   [McKay studies the display.]

     MCKAY
     Well, there's no casualties reported. Looks like the mine was
     surrendered without a fight.

     BADEN
     I told my army to minimize collateral damage.

     WEIR
     You need to get back there. Take Ronon and Teyla with you. Go to
     your respective countries, and make sure this does not get any
     further out of hand. No one has been hurt yet; let's keep it that
     way.

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [Nola, McKay and Ronon hurry down the steps.]

     HELKIN
     You're back. We were beginning to worry.

     NOLA
     What's the status?

     HELKIN
     I've ordered three army units to retake the mine. They're on their
     way.

     MCKAY
     Oh, no. No-no-no. You need to put a stop to that.

     NOLA
     Why?

     MCKAY
     Look, we just need to step back and reassess the situation here,
     okay? We should be thinking about easing tensions, not inflaming
     them!

     NOLA
     Oh, no. They're continuing to advance.

     MCKAY
     What?

   [McKay and Ronon study the computer display, which shows the Hallona
   troops leaving the mine and advancing towards the advancing Geldar
   forces.]

     NOLA

     (to Helkin)
     Divert the units away from the mine. Have them gather in the
     village. Prepare to defend it.

     RONON

     (low to McKay)
     Isn't this what you're supposed to be stopping?

     MCKAY
     Yes. Look, listen to me, you cannot engage them!

     NOLA
     We must protect our people!

     MCKAY
     Look, I agree, but you've got to give Sheppard some time. He'll call
     off the army.

     NOLA

     (fiercely, skeptical)
     Will he?

   [McKay sighs and moves away from the panel.]

   EXT--HALLONA VILLAGE HEADQUARTERS, DAY

   [Sheppard stands in a doorway. Teyla stands inside. Baden is with his
   people by their own Oracle station.]

     MCKAY

     (over radio)
     Sheppard, come in.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Go ahead.

     MCKAY

     (over radio, nervous)
     Are you watching what's going on here?

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     No, we just got here. Pretty much the same set up as yours. We don't
     have electricity, but I'm not gonna get into that right now.

     MCKAY

     (into radio, impatient)
     Your army is still on the march!

   [Sheppard hurries over to Baden and the control station.]

     SHEPPARD
     What?!

     MCKAY

     (over radio)
     Look, they're headed to one of my villages. You need to call them
     off before they--

     TEYLA
     The attack has begun.

   [They watch as Baden's forces take over the Geldar village. The Geldar
   forces retreat again.]

   INT--GELAR HEADQUARTERS

     MCKAY
     What? No-no-no-no. That can't be right.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     That was fast, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     Well, they retreated without any kind of a fight. What kind of army
     is that?

     RONON

     (shrugging)
     Well, at least there's no casualties.

     NOLA
     It's all right. I have another plan.

   [Nola leaves.]

     MCKAY
     What other plan?

     RONON
     Why are you asking me?

     Well...

     MCKAY
     What counterattack?

     HELKIN
     From...information you gave us about high temperature and energetic
     materials technology, I have constructed a tactical explosive
     device.

     MCKAY
     Wait...a bomb? You actually built a bomb?!

     NOLA
     I told you we'd always be several steps ahead of Baden.

     MCKAY
     How come I didn't know about this?

     NOLA
     We have yet to test it, so it still appears to not exist.

     HELKIN
     We will target one of Hallona's outlying villages.

     MCKAY
     How are you going to deliver it, huh? I mean, the-the catapult
     couldn't possibly reach that far.

     HELKIN
     I will deliver it.

     NOLA

     Using one of the airships you taught us to build.
     (to Helkin)
     Go.

   [Helkin nods and leaves, taking the plans.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, no. No-no-no-no-no. Come back!

   EXT--HALLONA VILLAGE, DAY

   [Sheppard and Teyla step out of headquarters, looking worried.]

     SHEPPARD

     (furious, low into radio)
     You taught them how to build a bomb?!

   [The conversation switches between Geldar and Hallona.]

     MCKAY
     No! I mean...not specifically. Look...okay...maybe I provided them
     with the list of ingredients...but...

     SHEPPARD
     Gah! I don't believe this!

     TEYLA
     How much damage can it cause?

     MCKAY
     Enough to take out an entire village?

     TEYLA

     (panicked)
     Well, then you must tell them to stop!

     MCKAY
     I tried that! It's already on the way!

     SHEPPARD
     How are they delivering it?

     MCKAY

     (weakly)
     Dirigible?

     SHEPPARD
     You just had to cheat, didn't you!

     MCKAY
     I did not cheat! Look, nowhere in the rules did it specifically
     outlaw the development of flying machines, only the...degree and
     speed of technological advancement.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, they advanced pretty damn fast, didn't they!?

     TEYLA
     Do we still have time to shoot it down?

     MCKAY

     (checking watch)
     Yes. Yes, I think so.

     TEYLA
     Then we'd better get moving.

   [Sheppard and Teyla leave.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GAME ROOM

   [Weir enters the room. Zelenka and Lorne are arguing animatedly across
   the two opposing computer terminals. They have not noticed her
   presence.]

     ZELENKA
     Absurd!

     LORNE
     What are you talking about? It's a personally reasonable request.

     ZELENKA

     (sarcastic)
     Oh, yeah. Perfectly reasonable. I give you all of my food, and my
     people starve.

     LORNE

     (talking over Zelenka)
     I am not asking you for all your food!

     ZELENKA

     (talking over Lorne)
     Yeah, that's perfectly reasonable to me, all right.

     LORNE
     I did say that we would make a deal.

     ZELENKA

     (scoffing)
     A deal. Oh yeah, baskets.

     LORNE
     Big baskets! Two dozen of them, hand woven, and very nice!

     ZELENKA
     Oh very nice? What am I going to put in them, huh? Certainly not
     food!

     LORNE
     You know what? I think you're holding out on me. I think you have
     plenty of food.

     ZELENKA
     Are you calling me a liar?

     LORNE
     No, I think you're trying to squeeze me for a better deal. That's
     what I think!

     ZELENKA
     Ach! I have got nothing to hide! Now I--

     LORNE
     Okay, okay, then maybe I should send some of my army troops down,
     and we'll have a look, then.

     WEIR

     (shouting)
     What the hell are you two doing?!

   [Lorne straightens to parade rest. Zelenka stares, mouth agape.]

     WEIR
     I thought I gave specific orders to stay away from this device?

     ZELENKA

     (abashed)
     Yes, yes you did.

     LORNE

     (contrite)
     We just saw that there was some...people in trouble, and we thought
     maybe that we could...uh...help.

   [He exchanges looks with Zelenka.]

     WEIR
     No! No more help. Clearly, we are not qualified. Now, turn this
     thing off, disconnect the power, and seal the room.

     ZELENKA
     Yeah, okay, but we...

     WEIR

     (firmly)
     Now.

     LORNE
     Yes, ma'am.

   [Weir leaves as Lorne and Zelenka type commands into the keyboard,
   shutting down the system.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [McKay, Ronon, Nola and others stare at the terminal display. Some sort
   of timer is ticking.]

     NOLA
     I'd hoped you would be proud of our accomplishments.

     MCKAY

     (upset)
     I am. Really, I just-I wish it didn't lead to this.

   EXT--M4D-058, DAY

   [The puddle jumper flies across the sky.]

   INT--GELDAR CONTROL ROOM

   [The display shows a new ship (the jumper) on the screen.]

     GARTH
     What's that?

   [Nola looks to McKay, who exchanges an awkward look with Ronon.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD
     There it is.

   [They can see the dirigible in the distance through the window.]

     TEYLA
     Good. Now all you have to do is puncture the balloon.

     SHEPPARD
     Already on it.

   EXT--M4D-058, DAY

   [The jumper fires a single drone which strikes at the center of the
   balloon.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [The display shows the jumper firing and striking the dirigible.]

     NOLA
     Colonel Sheppard! He shot down our airship with the puddle jumper!

   [She looks accusingly at McKay.]

     RONON
     Yeah, don't worry, no one was hurt.

     MCKAY
     He-he just...punctured it. It sank harmlessly to the ground.

     NOLA

     (to Garth)
     Prepare the other bombs for delivery.

     RONON
     Other bombs?

     MCKAY
     What, you have more?

   [Ronon and McKay exchange looks.]

     RONON

     (sarcastic)
     Great.

   INT--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

   [Sheppard and Teyla return to the headquarters. Baden looks chastened.]

     BADEN
     Thank you for your help. You saved the lives of everyone in that
     village.

     SHEPPARD
     We won't be doing that again.

     BADEN
     I had no idea they were capable of delivering such a device.

     SHEPPARD

     (with sidelong glance at Teyla)
     Tell me about it.

     BADEN
     I've issued orders to make certain they don't try again.

     SHEPPARD

     (suspicious)
     What kind of orders?

     BADEN
     A full-scale attack has been launched. It's time to finish this war.

   [They watch the terminal screen as Baden's forces start to invade
   Geldar.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [Nola and Garth study plans. Ronon and McKay stand on the staircase
   balcony above.]

     RONON
     I've seen this before. If two sides are dead set on fighting,
     nothing's going to stop them.

     MCKAY
     So I gotta get Nola to call off the attack.

     RONON

     (scoffing)
     You couldn't do it before. What makes you think you can now?

     MCKAY
     How about a little encouragement, huh? You know, a "go get 'em,
     Rodney? I have faith in you?"

   [Ronon stares at McKay.]

     MCKAY
     Okay, whatever. Look, I am not giving up on these people. Which
     means until we get them to call this war off, then we are staying
     put right here!

   [The pair are beamed away.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Daedalus is in orbit above M4D-058.]

   INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR

   [Ronon and McKay are beamed into a corridor. Sheppard and Teyla are
   already aboard and heading down the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     We could use your help. Come on!

     MCKAY
     Whoa-whoa-whoa! What the hell's going on?

     SHEPPARD
     Elizabeth diverted the Daedalus on its way back to Earth to check up
     on us.

     TEYLA
     Colonel Caldwell believed that the situation had deteriorated. He
     feared that we would become casualties of war and so, beamed us out.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but, I talked him into beaming us back, but we gotta do
     something first, so come on.

   [Sheppard grabs McKay by his tactical vest and drags him along. They
   start heading down the corridor.]

     MCKAY
     Wha--do what?

     SHEPPARD
     I got a plan.

     MCKAY
     What plan?

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, come on, already.

     TEYLA

     (to Ronon)
     How's the situation on your end?

     RONON
     All out war. You?

   [Teyla sighs.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [Garth watches the display. Ronon and McKay walk down the steps.]

     NOLA
     Where did you go? What happened?

     MCKAY
     Uh...nowhere? No, we were just upstairs.

     NOLA
     Someone said you vanished into thin air.

     MCKAY
     What? No. That's ridiculous. How could we vanish?

     GARTH
     The airships have passed the southern forests. They're nearing their
     targets.

     NOLA
     That's hope we strike first, before Baden's army reaches our
     villages. We'll destroy their will to fight.

   [McKay grabs Nola by the shoulders.]

     MCKAY

     (fiercely)
     Okay, listen to me! For two years now, I have been the Oracle to
     your people. I have given you much wisdom and guidance and-and
     bestowed much of my knowledge. Look, it's like you said, I was a
     god!

     RONON

     (low, warning)
     Easy...

     MCKAY
     And yes, yes, I may just be a man, but that wisdom still remains!
     And now, more than ever, you need to heed my guidance and call back
     those ships!

     NOLA

     (troubled)
     You told me it was time to start thinking on my own.

     MCKAY
     Right...?

     NOLA
     So now I am. My people are looking to me. This is my decision. And
     we will be victorious.

   [McKay and Ronon sigh and exchange looks.]

   INT--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

   [Baden watches the dirigibles approach his villages and moves
   restlessly. Sheppard and Teyla are with him.]

     BADEN
     Why won't you help us?!

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not shooting down any more ships. We're done helping you wage
     this war.

     BADEN
     Then we'll shoot them down ourselves.

     TEYLA
     How?

   [Baden nods to an aide, who leaves.]

     BADEN
     Our weapons are not as primitive as Nola believes.

     TEYLA
     Many people will die on both sides.

     BADEN
     If you want to leave, then leave! We'll continue this fight even if
     you've lost the will.

     SHEPPARD
     You're making a big mistake...

     BADEN
     The only mistake was not doing this sooner! You'll see. This is the
     right path for my people.

   [Teyla and Sheppard exchange looks.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [Nola studies the terminal display.]

     NOLA
     They've reached our villages.

     GARTH
     Two have already fallen.

     NOLA
     Airships are almost in position. We should--

   [An alarm interrupts her. One of the airships disappears from the
   screen.]

     NOLA
     What happened?

     MCKAY

     They shot down one of your ships!
     (protesting)
     It wasn't the puddle jumper.

     RONON
     Maybe one of the catapults hit it.

     NOLA
     No! Impossible!

   [They watch as the last of the airships is destroyed. Further south on
   the display, explosions rock the Geldar villages.]

     GARTH
     Two more villages have fallen. It appears many are dead.

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Sheppard, come in! Sheppard!
     (to others)
     The radio's dead.

   [Explosions are heard in the distance.]

     NOLA
     They're coming here...

   [Everyone races outside.]

   EXT--GELDAR, DAY

   [People run, panicked, through the streets. McKay, Nola, and Ronon run
   outside.]

     MCKAY
     What, they have bombs, too?

     RONON

     (to Nola)
     We need to get your people out of here, now!

     MCKAY

     (to Ronon)
     Help them!

   [Ronon runs to help in the evacuation. McKay joins Nola back inside.]

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [McKay and Nola are back with Garth. The explosions are closer.]

     GARTH
     Their army has surrounded us.

   [Ronon comes back in.]

     RONON
     The road out of the village is blocked. People are being slaughtered
     as they try to leave.

     MCKAY
     We're trapped!

   [The power on the Oracle terminal dies.]

     GARTH
     What shall we do?

     NOLA

     (defeated)
     It's over.

   INT--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

   [Explosions rock Hallona as well as Sheppard and Baden watch the
   terminal screen.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Rodney, where the hell are you?

     BELEN
     They've dropped another bomb! Hundreds have died! How can you stand
     by and let this happen?!

   [Teyla runs in.]

     TEYLA
     Nola's army has surrounded the village.

     SHEPPARD
     Can we get to the jumper?

     TEYLA
     They've just destroyed it.

   [Baden watches the terminal as his villages are being obliterated.]

     BADEN
     We're being overwhelmed.

     TEYLA
     What should we do?

   [The Oracle terminal loses power. The explosions stop. Baden looks
   around, then stares at Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD
     Game over.

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Rodney, you there?

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Yeah. We hear you. We'll give you a call when we're ready to be
     picked up.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Got it.

     NOLA
     I don't understand. What's going on?

   INT--HALLONA HEADQUARTERS

     SHEPPARD

     (to Baden)
     What you just witnessed is what I would call is another level to the
     game.

   INT--GELDAR HEADQUARTERS

   [The conversations switch between McKay & Ronon talking to Nola and
   Sheppard & Teyla talking to Baden.]

     MCKAY
     See, we were beamed up earlier to our ship, the Daedalus, in...orbit
     over your planet.

     SHEPPARD
     While we were there, I had Doctor McKay hack into the two devices,
     upload doomsday scenarios for each of your countries into the game.

     TEYLA
     Everything you saw just now was transmitted from the Daedalus.

     BADEN
     You mean...none of this was real?

     MCKAY
     No, no one was hurt, no one was killed--all just part of the
     simulation.

     RONON
     In reality, your two armies are standing down, awaiting further
     instructions.

     NOLA
     But we heard explosions! We felt them!

     SHEPPARD
     Thanks to some...pinpoint shots from our friends in the Daedalus. It
     really added to the realism, didn't it?

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     I'm sorry that we had to do that. But you needed to see how this
     could end.

     RONON
     Feel what a real war is like.

     SHEPPARD
     You still think it was the right path for your people?

   [Nola and Baden each look troubled at what they've learned.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Weir walks in with a female scientist.]

     WEIR
     Thanks, Melanie.

   [Weir grabs a bottled water. She notices McKay and Sheppard playing
   chess at a table.]

     WEIR
     Gentlemen...

     SHEPPARD
     How's it going?

     WEIR
     Eh, it's still going. I'm just taking a break. There's a lot of
     animosity to be unraveled, but I think they are finally willing to
     at least try to make it work.

     MCKAY
     Well, it's about time.

     WEIR
     Yeah. And you two? Called a truce yet?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Sure. We're-we're good.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, don't worry, we're going to stick to Chess from now on.

     SHEPPARD
     As long as Rodney doesn't cheat.

     MCKAY
     Oh, please. Like I need to cheat playing you?

     WEIR
     Okay, I'll leave you to it, then.

   [McKay moves his knight.]

     MCKAY
     Hah!

   [Sheppard moves his rook, taking McKay's pawn, and leaving his king
   unprotected.]

     SHEPPARD
     "Hah!" Checkmate.

     MCKAY
     What? Wh-wh-whoa, no-no-no-no. What happened there?

     SHEPPARD
     What happened there is I just kicked your ass.

     MCKAY
     No, no, I was distracted. She was...Okay, we're going again. Best of
     ten.

   [He proceeds to reset the chess board to start another game.]
