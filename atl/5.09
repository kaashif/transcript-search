   TEASER

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--MCKAY'S QUARTERS

   [McKay primps in front of a mirror--fixing his hair and checking
   whether he looks better with his t-shirt sleeve rolled up or not.]

     MCKAY

     (reciting as memory exercise)
     Neuraminidase inhibitor. Neuraminidase inhibitor. Neuraminidase
     inhibitor.

   [The door opens. McKay straightens his sleeve quickly as Sheppard
   enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey.

     MCKAY

     (guiltily)
     Hey.

     SHEPPARD
     I hear you're going off-world.

     MCKAY
     I'm, uh, assisting with a, uh, medical follow-up on M33-985, yes.

     SHEPPARD
     With Keller.

     MCKAY
     Right again.

     SHEPPARD
     On your day off.

     MCKAY
     What, I can't go off-world in my free time?

     SHEPPARD
     No, no, go ahead. I just think it's odd you're volunteering for
     goodwill missions on your...day off.

     MCKAY
     Well, I'm turning over a new leaf. It's a whole new, uh, you know,
     kinder, gentler Rodney McKay.

   [Sheppard looks at him suspiciously and nods; he leaves contemplating
   something.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [McKay strides into the Gate Room, carrying only his jacket, which is
   casually over one shoulder. His face falls as he sees Ronon standing by
   Keller, who's packing a computer into her bag. She stands and turns,
   spotting McKay.]

     KELLER

     (smiling)
     Oh, there you are! You all set?

   [McKay puts on his jacket.]

     MCKAY

     (with false brightness, to Ronon)
     You...coming too, are you?

     KELLER
     Yeah. Ronon offered to help out, too. So I just thought, you know,
     the more the merrier, right?

     MCKAY
     Hmm.

     RONON
     Is there a problem?

     MCKAY
     No, no, no, just, I was--I was just...no, it's nothing.

     KELLER
     Okay...uh, go ahead and dial, Chuck!

   [The Stargate starts to dial out. Both Ronon and McKay reach for
   Keller's other bag and pick it up.]

     MCKAY
     Right. I got this. I'm good. I got it. I got it. I'm good.

   [Ronon does not release his hold, and has a firmer grasp on it.]

     MCKAY
     You want it? You-you take that.. I got...my own stuff, that I'll
     bring.

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--VILLAGE, M33-985, DAY

   [Ronon, Keller, and McKay walk into the medieval era village.]

     KELLER
     So the people we're seeing today--as long as you avoid any physical
     contact, you should be fine. The contagion doesn't seem to be
     airborne.

   [Someone watches the trio from foliage near the village.]

     RONON
     What's wrong with these people again?

     KELLER
     Uh, it's a disease similar to one on Earth called influenza. It's
     been spreading throughout the village. Not too severe a strain,
     but...enough to put a scare into them.

   INT--ERRAN'S HOME

   [Keller uses her stethoscope to check a boy's lungs while he lies in
   bed. His mother, Erran, hovers nearby. McKay and Ronon stand in the
   doorway.]

     KELLER
     He's caught it, too.

     ERRAN
     Will he be all right?

     KELLER

     (nodding)
     His fever's mild. So, plenty of rest, lots of fluids, and he should
     be fine. I'm also going to prescribe some medicine.

     MCKAY

     (casually)
     Oh, a, uh, neuraminidase inhibitor?

     KELLER

     (impressed)
     Very good. Um...can I have a look at you too, Erran? Just to be on
     the safe side.

   [Erran glances self-consciously back at Ronon and McKay. Keller follows
   her gaze.]

     KELLER
     Uh, do you guys mind giving us some privacy? I think there's a
     tavern close by. Why don't you go get some lunch.

     MCKAY

     (stammering)
     Oh...you want to...sure.

   [Ronon and McKay awkwardly take their leave.]

   EXT--TAVERN, DAY

   [Ronon and McKay sit at an outside table. Ronon is devouring his stew
   with gusto. McKay stares at his bowl with distaste.]

     RONON
     What's the matter? You don't like it?

   [McKay clears his throat and gingerly picks out a bone from his
   stew--setting it in the center of the table. Ronon shrugs.]

     RONON
     You know, you don't have to be here. I'm sure you got plenty of
     stuff to do back on Atlantis.

     MCKAY
     Oddly enough, I don't, actually. But, if you need to get back, then
     um...

     RONON
     No, I'm good.

     MCKAY
     Of course you are.

     RONON
     Mm-hmm.

   [Ronon picks up McKay's bone, then bites off the end of the bone and
   sucks the marrow between spoonfuls of stew.]

   EXT--OUTSIDE ERRAN'S HOME, DAY

   [Ronon and McKay go to Erran's doorstep and knock.]

     MCKAY

     (nervously)
     You think we've given them enough time? I mean, I don't want to
     interrupt if they're in the middle of medical...

   [Ronon knocks.]

     MCKAY
     ...stuff.

   [Erran opens the door.]

     MCKAY
     Hi. Um...is Doctor Keller done?

     ERRAN
     She's not with you? She finished with us, then left. Said she was
     going to join you at the tavern.

   [Ronon exchanges looks with McKay, then walks away.]

     MCKAY
     Oh right. Very good. Thanks.

   [McKay follows Ronon.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, M33-985, DAY

   [Ronon and McKay search the village.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Jennifer.

     RONON

     (calling loudly)
     Jennifer!

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Jennifer, it's Rodney. Do you read me?

     RONON
     Jennifer!

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Doctor Keller, please respond!
     (to Ronon)
     Well, either her radio isn't working or she's turned it off.

     RONON
     She wouldn't do that.

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     Then what happened to her?

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--VILLAGE, M33-985, DAY

   [Ronon and McKay rendezvous at the center of the village.]

     MCKAY
     Anything?

     RONON
     Checked up and down the street. No one's seen her. It's like she
     just vanished.

     MCKAY
     That doesn't make any sense. I mean, she wouldn't take off without
     telling us where she's going.

     RONON
     Not unless someone took her against her will. Maybe you should go
     back to the 'gate, radio Atlantis for help.

     MCKAY
     Maybe you're right.

     RONON
     I'll stay here and check the entire village.

   [They part ways.]

   EXT--FOREST, M33-985, DAY

   [Keller awakens to find herself leaning against a tree. A tall man
   crouches a short distance away. He has his back to her and rummaging
   through her pack. She notices her hands are tied in front of her. She
   tests the bindings then reaches for her missing headset. The man
   notices her movements and walks over. She shifts defensively.]

     KELLER

     (tightly)
     Who are you?

     KIRYK
     If you'd stop struggling, I wouldn't have to stun you.

     KELLER
     What do you want from me?

     KIRYK
     And stop asking questions.

     KELLER
     I just want to know why you kidnapped me. How did you take me from
     the village? I don't even remember...

   [Kiryk pulls his sidearm, a Wraith stunner. Keller purses her lips and
   looks away, fighting back her fear. She looks back silently when he
   doesn't fire.]

     KIRYK
     Good. Let's go.

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Ronon walks through another part of the forest.]

     RONON

     (into radio)
     McKay?

     MCKAY

     (over radio)
     Yeah, go ahead.

     RONON
     I got some footprints outside the village.

   [The conversation switches from Ronon's location to where McKay is
   heading towards the Stargate.]

     MCKAY
     Jennifer's?

     RONON
     Standard Atlantis tread. There's someone with her. Bigger prints,
     like my size. Looks like there was a struggle.

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     Oh...dammit.

     RONON
     Weird thing is, it's like they just appeared out of nowhere.

     MCKAY
     What do you mean "nowhere"?

     RONON
     I mean there's nothing at all between here and the village, and then
     they just appear. Like they dropped out of the sky. Wait a sec...
     Got a single set of tracks heading into the woods.

   [He starts to follow them.]

     MCKAY
     A single set?

     RONON
     Not Keller's, the other guy's.

     MCKAY
     So what happened to Keller's?

   [Ronon crouches by the tracks.]

     RONON
     Ah, these prints are deeper. My guess is he's carrying her. Probably
     knocked her unconscious, or...

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     Oh, god.

   [Ronon stands and starts to follow the tracks.]

     RONON
     I'm going to check it out.

     MCKAY
     Maybe we should wait. All right, I'm almost to the 'gate. I-I-I'll
     radio ahead, get a-a team here. Do a proper search.

     RONON
     That sounds good. You do that. Meantime, I'm going after her.

   [McKay gives an exasperated sigh and double-times it towards the
   Stargate.]

     RONON
     McKay?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I'm here.

     RONON

     (smiling)
     I got two sets of tracks again. She's still alive.

   EXT--M33-985 STARGATE, DAY

   [McKay has reached the Stargate. He gives a relieved sigh.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, great! That's great! All right, I'm at the 'gate. I'll get the
     search teams mobilized, join you shortly.

   [The Stargate begins to activate from an incoming wormhole. McKay hides
   in the nearby foliage. Four Wraith exit the Stargate, splitting up.
   McKay starts to back away, but breaks a bit of wood as he moves. One of
   the Wraith hears him.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, crap!

   [McKay starts running. The Wraith hisses and gives chase.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Ronon!

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

     RONON
     What?

     MCKAY
     We got Wraith!

     RONON
     How many?

   [Ronon turns back and starts to run towards McKay's position.]

     MCKAY
     Four of them just came through the 'gate, and one of them's about to
     kill me!

   [McKay gives a primal scream and shoots blindly behind him at the
   Wraith. The Wraith shoots his stunner, but misses. McKay is starting to
   falter, but continues to run. He takes refuge behind a trunk when he
   reaches a small clearing. The Wraith pauses at the clearing, trying to
   decide where to go. McKay, from his hiding place, hears the Wraith
   moving away. McKay risks peeking out from behind the stump, only to
   find the Wraith standing in wait on the other side.]

     MCKAY
     Oh shi--!

   [McKay makes a break for it, barely missing being stunned. The Wraith
   tackles him to the ground. The Wraith stands over him. McKay shoots a
   whole magazine at the Wraith, but it keeps coming, pulling him up and
   pinning him against a tree. It raises its hand to feed.]

     MCKAY
     Oh!

   [Ronon shoots the Wraith from behind with his stunner. The Wraith
   falls.]

     MCKAY

     (breathless and relieved)
     Oh, finally! Oh...what took you so long!?

     RONON

     (drily)
     Oh, you're welcome.

   [McKay groans. Ronon looks at the Wraith more closely.]

     RONON
     It's a hunter.

     MCKAY
     What?

     RONON
     Wraith hunter. They chase runners.

     MCKAY
     I thought runners were extremely rare, like, only a few in the
     galaxy!

     RONON
     That's right.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, so a few years we run into you, and now another one? I mean
     wha-what are the odds of that?

   [Ronon looks around.]

     RONON
     Where'd the other Wraith go?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. They-they spread out into the forest.

   [Ronon starts to run.]

     MCKAY
     Where are you go--? Where are you going? Hey wait!

   [McKay, still breathless, follows.]

   EXT--FOREST, KELLER' S POSITION, DAY

     KIRYK
     This is as far as we go on the trail.

   [He abruptly spins Keller to set her down against a tree trunk.]

     KELLER
     Oh! Where are you taking me?

   [Kiryk sets Keller's packs near her. He opens one and starts pulling
   out more rope.]

     KELLER
     At least tell me your name.

   [Kiryk ties Keller's legs together.]

     KIRYK
     There'll be time to talk when we get there.

     KELLER

     (frustrated)
     Where?

   [Kiryk starts making careful tracks up the trail.]

     KELLER
     What are you doing?

   [He continues to make tracks. Keller hears foliage rustling nearby. She
   perks, alert.]

     KELLER

     (whispering)
     Ronon?

   [A Wraith appears on the other side of the foliage. Keller stares
   petrified. She looks from the Wraith to her captor, making a quick
   decision as the Wraith fires its stunner.]

     KELLER
     Watch out!

   [Kiryk taps his armband and disappears as the Wraith fires. Kiryk ends
   up behind the Wraith and unsheathes a sword. The Wraith turns just
   before Kiryk decapitates him. Keller watches in horror as Kiryk cleans
   his blade on the Wraith's clothes.]

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   [Ronon is already speaking with Erran as McKay catches up.]

     RONON
     We need to get your people to a safe place as fast as possible.

     ERRAN
     Why? What happened?

     RONON
     We spotted Wraith in the area.

     ERRAN
     Wraith? Coming here?

     MCKAY

     (out of breath)
     Hopefully not. It's just a few of them. We think they're looking for
     someone else.

     RONON
     But we don't want to take any chances.

     MCKAY
     Look, have you seen anyone different in the village recently?
     Any-any newcomers? Anyone that looks...uh...uh...like that?

   [He points to Ronon, who shoots him a glare.]

     ERRAN
     No.

     RONON
     We don't have time for this. Is there a place your people can hide?

     ERRAN
     There are dozens of caverns surrounding the village. Our ancestors
     used them during the last culling.

     RONON
     Good. Come on. Let's go.

   [They head out together.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Keller is again led along by the arm by Kiryk. She looks at the
   armband.]

     KELLER
     What is that thing?

     KIRYK
     Take too long to explain.

     KELLER
     Too long? We've been walking for hours now. Can I at least rest for
     a bit?

     KIRYK
     No.

     KELLER

     (whining)
     Just a few minutes?

     KIRYK
     A few minutes to allow your team to gain ground on us?

     KELLER

     (quickly)
     What team?

     KIRYK
     You're from Atlantis. You're a doctor. There were two men traveling
     with you.

   [Keller stares at Kiryk for a moment, then breaks free and makes a run
   for it. She goes several yards through the forest before Kiryk appears
   in front of her, aiming his stunner. She stops short and gasps in
   alarm. He stuns her, and she falls unconscious.]

   EXT--FOREST NEAR CAVERNS, DAY

   [Ronon and McKay supervise the evacuation of the villagers.]

     RONON
     Watch your step. Just keep going. It's just past that gully, you're
     almost there.

     MCKAY
     That's it. That's it. Mind your step, sir.

   [The large woman with short hair glares at McKay.]

     LARGE WOMAN

     (insulted)
     Sir?

     MCKAY
     Ma-ma'am, sorry. I--you have-have a...

   [She's already moved past. He turns to Ronon.]

     MCKAY
     That is clearly a mustache!

   [Ronon glares at McKay. Erran is at the end of the procession.]

     ERRAN
     That's the last of them. The village is empty now.

     RONON
     Good. Go with them. Make sure they stay in the caverns. And...keep
     them quiet. Make sure no one makes a sound unless you hear from me.

     MCKAY
     Or me!

     ERRAN
     All right. Thank you.

   [She follows the villagers.]

     MCKAY

     (to Ronon)
     Hey, maybe we should go back to the 'gate?

     RONON
     No, go ahead. I'm going to keep tracking Keller.

     MCKAY
     Wha--I do not think it is wise for us to split up right now. We have
     no idea where the Wraith are.

     RONON
     It takes too long to go back. That runner took her. We let him get
     too far ahead, we'll never find them. Look, if you want to go to the
     'gate, go ahead. I'm leaving.

   [He starts off.]

     MCKAY
     Ronon? Ronon! I--oh, dammit! Would you just...Ronon!

   [McKay chases after him.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Keller awakens on the forest floor, still tied up. She winces as she
   tries to get up. Kiryk stands over her.]

     KIRYK
     You done trying to escape?

   [Keller nods in defeat.]

     KIRYK
     More Wraith close by. We need to keep moving.

   [He lifts her up easily with one arm, then leads her by the elbow
   through the forest.]

     KELLER
     You're not from the village, are you? I've never noticed you, and I
     pretty much met everyone. Are you even from this planet? You're the
     one who brought the Wraith here. They're after you, why?

     KIRYK
     I'm a runner. You know about runners?

     KELLER
     One of the men I'm traveling with...he used to be one.

   [Kiryk stops short.]

     KIRYK
     Used to be? That's impossible. Runners don't stop being runners.

     KELLER
     Yeah? Well, this one did.

     KIRYK
     Yeah? Well, how?

     KELLER

     (earnestly)
     Take me to him, and we'll tell you.

   [Kiryk stares at her, not trusting her.]

     KELLER
     I promise. Look, we don't have to be enemies.

     KIRYK
     Nice try.

   [He leads her away.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [McKay catches up to Ronon crouched down.]

     MCKAY

     Hey! If you--
     (sees Ronon concentrating)
     What?

     RONON
     This is where Keller's tracks start up again. Look--smaller,
     shallower...Atlantis tread. These prints are bigger and deeper.

     MCKAY
     The runner.

     RONON
     Keller's tracks are uneven. She's either hurt or bound. Probably
     both.

     MCKAY
     Well, at least the tracks are clear, though. Easier to follow,
     right?

     RONON
     That's the problem. No runner's that stupid.

   EXT--P33-985, DUSK

   INT--FOREST, DUSK

   [Ronon and McKay continue to track through the forest.]

     RONON
     It's going to be dark soon.

   [McKay waves his scanner.]

     MCKAY
     Actually, we have two hours, forty-three minutes, and seventeen
     seconds. This planet's sun currently has a very gradual angle of
     descent and a very short night. I always make it a point to download
     the planetary data on every address I dial, even goodwill missions.
     You know, things like, uh, atmospheric conditions, soil
     consistencies, available water supplies. What?

     RONON

     (shaking his head)
     Just wondering how long you'd make it out here without your little
     gadgets.

     MCKAY
     Oh, you know, I think you'd be surprised, you know? I mean I may not
     be exactly what you would call an "outdoors person", but that
     doesn't mean I don't [sic] find the whole "man versus nature" thing
     uninteresting. Hell, I joined a scouting organization when I was a
     child. Lodge 14 of the Fort McMurray Eager Beavers.

     RONON
     Beavers?

     MCKAY
     Yep. Large rodent. Big teeth. Uses them to chop down trees and build
     dams. Very industrious. I was with them for a few months before they
     asked me to leave, but, uh, I got the manual. Still have
     it--Scouting for Beavers. Invaluable resource. So, I think you'll
     find in a pinch, I handle myself very well, thank you very--

   [Ronon pauses, a troubled look on his face.]

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     What is it?

     RONON
     Blood.

     MCKAY
     Oh, my god.

     RONON
     No, it's Wraith blood.

   [He moves forward and looks at the tree where Keller had been crouched
   when the Wraith was decapitated.]

     RONON
     Here we go. Someone was sitting here...Look...single set of
     tracks...

   [He points up the trail. Then looks to the foliage off to one side.]

     RONON
     ...but they left the trail going that way.

     MCKAY
     Are you sure? 'Cause the footprints keep going this way.

     RONON
     Single set.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, I know. But maybe he's carrying her again. Or maybe they were
     attacked by the Wraith. Jennifer was stunned...and then the runner
     kills the Wraith and disposes the body...and then carries Jennifer
     on up the trail. Look how deep these tracks are. I say we follow
     these.

   [He starts to move, but Ronon blocks his path by putting out a large
   stick across his chest.]

     RONON
     Easy.

   [Ronon moves up cautiously, testing the ground with his stick. He comes
   to a point where he pauses, then pushes the stick deep into the ground.
   A trap is sprung. The ground gives way as a tarp separates, revealing
   two trunks filled with rotating wooden spikes. McKay stares in horror.]

     RONON
     Like I said, no runner's that stupid.

   EXT--BOTTOM OF CLIFF, DUSK

   [Kiryk and Keller stop at the foot of a large vertical cliff or rock.]

     KELLER
     What now?

     KIRYK
     We go up.

     KELLER
     Up? How? Do you have a rope?

     KIRYK
     No need for ropes.

   [He takes Keller's arm and taps his armband. They disappear.]

   EXT--TOP OF CLIFF, DUSK

   [They re-materialize at the top of the cliff.]

     KELLER

     (nonplussed)
     Did we just...? How did we do that?

     KIRYK

     I was on a planet a while back, lots of technology. Got this from
     one of the locals.
     (indicates the armband)
     Barely put it on my arm before it fused to my skin. Since then, if I
     hit this light when it's green, I can disappear--move around from
     place to place.

     KELLER
     Teleportation. That's how you got me out of the village so fast.

     KIRYK
     I can only go short distances. It needs time to recharge between
     jumps, especially when I take someone with me. But...it's helped me
     stay ahead of the Wraith.

   [He starts leading her away.]

     KELLER
     I imagine so.

   EXT--FOREST, DUSK

   [Ronon pauses along the trail, calling back impatiently.]

     RONON
     McKay!

   [There is no sign of McKay.]

     RONON
     Dammit.

   EXT--FALLEN LOG, FOREST, DUSK

   [McKay sits on a log. He has taken off his boot and shakes out a
   pebble. He sighs. There is a rustling behind him. A Wraith comes up the
   trail, just as surprised to see McKay as McKay is to see him. The
   Wraith fires his stunner, but McKay dodges the blast, hopping on one
   foot while firing his pistol several times. The Wraith falls dead under
   the blasts. Ronon appears out of the woods, his gun drawn. He checks
   the downed Wraith.]

     RONON
     What the hell are you doing?

     MCKAY
     At the moment, killing Wraith!

     RONON
     What are you stopping for?

     MCKAY
     I had a stone in my boot, I told you.

   [He hops back to the log and works on putting his boot back on.]

     RONON
     No, you didn't.

     MCKAY
     Yes, I did! I said, "Wait up! I got a stone in my boot."

     RONON

     (impatient)
     Every second you lag behind makes it that much harder for me to
     track this guy, especially at night.

   [McKay smiles as he looks at the dead Wraith.]

     MCKAY
     Not anymore. We don't have to play man-tracker now. We're going to
     know exactly where this guy is...

   [He walks over to the body and pulls the tracking scanner off the
   Wraith's wrist.]

     MCKAY
     ...Thanks to this handy gadget!

   [Ronon snatches the device away from McKay.]

     RONON
     Look at that signal! They're even farther away than I thought!

   [He throws the device back at McKay and storms off. McKay follows. They
   resume their trek.]

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry, but I guarantee, at some point, you're going to need my
     help. You'll see. There'll be some problem you can't solve. Then
     you'll turn to me. I'll figure it out in the nick of time, you'll
     say "good job," or just grunt, or slap me on the back harder than
     necessary. Anyways, the point is...we both have our gifts. So you
     need to stop resenting my presence here, and start realizing we're
     on the same team, both trying to achieve the same goal. All right?
     Are you listening? You got the tracker face. Can you hear what I'm
     saying here?

   EXT--FOREST, HIGHER GROUND, DUSK

   [Kiryk leads Keller through the woods.]

     KELLER
     When are you going to tell me what you want from me?

     KIRYK
     I need you to help someone.

     KELLER
     Who?

     KIRYK
     That's not important to you. You just need to give her medical
     attention.

     KELLER
     Her? Who is she? Your wife?

     KIRYK
     When we get there, I won't be able to stay with you. The longer I'm
     in one place, the greater the danger. Probably a dozen more Wraith
     on the way.

   EXT--BOTTOM OF CLIFF, DUSK

   [Ronon and McKay reach the bottom of the cliff.]

     RONON
     Trail ends here.

   [McKay checks the tracking scanner.]

     MCKAY
     Well, he's dead ahead. So either he climbed this thing, or he
     figured out how to get around it.

     RONON
     No sign they went around.

     MCKAY
     Well, so they must've had a rope or something, unlike us. Look, how
     are we going to get up there?

     RONON
     You said something about solving a problem...

     MCKAY
     Yeah, technological problems, not...rock climbing problems.

     RONON
     Thought so.

   [He walks away. McKay follows.]

   EXT--FOREST, HIGHER GROUND, DUSK

     KELLER
     Have you ever thought about trying to remove that tracking device.

     KIRYK
     You could say that. Had a few doctors try. No luck.

     KELLER
     I have advanced medical technology with me.

     KIRYK
     I know.

     KELLER
     So I could probably remove it. That runner I was telling you about?
     One of our doctors removed his tracking device. That's...how he was
     able to stop being a runner.

   [Kiryk stops walking and turns to face her.]

     KIRYK
     You have something in here that can remove it?

     KELLER
     I have a scanner. With that I can...pinpoint the location of your
     tracking device, give you some anesthetic, make a quick incision,
     you're free of it.

     KIRYK

     (hesitating)
     I...

     KELLER
     Look, you say there's someone who needs medical attention? It's
     going to be a lot safer for all of us if we throw the Wraith off
     your trail before we get there.

   [Kiryk sighs and puts down the bags he's been carrying. He unsheathes
   his sword.]

     KELLER
     Oh!

   [She stands very still as he cuts the bindings around her wrist. Freed,
   Keller reaches into her bag and pulls out her tablet scanner.]

     KELLER
     Okay...turn around.

     KIRYK
     If-if you try anything, I...

     KELLER

     (firmly)
     Just turn around.

   [Kiryk studies her uncertainly for a moment, then turns his back to
   her. She starts running her scanner. Her face falls.]

     KIRYK
     Do you see it?

   [She stops the scanner but does not answer. He turns back to face her.]

     KIRYK
     What did you see?

     KELLER

     (sadly)
     Your tracking device...it's different...It's much more complicated.
     It's branched out--fused not only to your spine but also to your
     brain stem. Removing it would kill you...I'm sorry.

   [Kiryk composes his expression.]

     KIRYK
     We need to get moving.

   [Keller repacks her scanner and follows him.]

   EXT--FOREST, DUSK

     MCKAY
     Okay, nightfall, seventeen minutes. But like I said, it's very
     brief. Like, uh, Whitehorse in June. Oh, not that you have any idea
     what Whitehorse is...or June for that matter...

   [There is a loud snapping sound. McKay stops and turns around.]

     MCKAY
     What the...

     RONON
     Whoa!

   [He dives to the ground, pushing McKay with him. They drop onto their
   stomachs just before a large log imbedded with wooden spikes swings
   down over where they were standing. It swings back and forth just
   inches over their heads. McKay raises up slightly.]

     MCKAY
     Holy crap! Did you see that thing?

   [Ronon shoves McKay's face into the dirt just as the log makes another
   pass. They watch the log continues to swing above them.]

     RONON

     (impressed)
     This guy's good.

     MCKAY

     (petrified)
     This guy's a killer!

   EXT--OUTSIDE CAVE, NIGHT

   [Keller and Kiryk reach an area of covered foliage.]

     KIRYK
     Good. No one found it.

     KELLER
     Found what?

   [Kiryk moves the foliage away to reveal a cave entrance.]

   INT--CAVE

   [The cave is lit by lanterns. A young girl sleeps on blankets in the
   corner, her forehead wet as with a fever. Keller pauses upon spotting
   the child, then starts forward.]

     KIRYK
     Her name is Celise.

     KELLER
     What happened to her?

     KIRYK
     She fell, injured her leg. I did my best to clean the wound, but...

   [He shows her the ragged injury.]

     KELLER
     It's infected! When did this happen?

     KIRYK
     A few days ago. When she got worse, I went looking for a doctor.
     Went to three different planets. I heard there were people from
     Atlantis helping the village here with their sickness. So...I
     brought her here, found this cave to hide her, and set a few traps
     to keep the Wraith or...anyone else away. Then...waited for you to
     show up.

   [Keller checks Celise's vital signs.]

     KELLER

     (annoyed)
     You know, you could've just asked for my help instead of kidnapping
     me.

     KIRYK
     I couldn't take that chance. Most people don't want anything to do
     with runners.

     KELLER
     Is she your daughter?

     KIRYK
     No. She lived in a village that was destroyed by the Wraith.

     KELLER
     Let me guess, you brought the Wraith there.

     KIRYK

     (defensively)
     I stayed there one night! I didn't think they'd find me that fast.
     They culled the whole village. Celise was the only person I could
     save.

   [Keller checks Celise's fever.]

     KIRYK

     (concerned)
     How bad is she?

     KELLER
     Very bad. Her blood pressure's dangerously low. She's septic...going
     into shock.

     KIRYK
     What does that mean?

     KELLER
     It means the wound is necrotic. I'm going to have to surgically
     debride it--cut away the dead tissue. I'm going to start her on an
     i.v. antibiotic. But she needs much stronger medications than I have
     with me. She's a very, very sick girl.

     KIRYK

     (insistent)
     She can't die. You cannot let her die!

     KELLER
     I'll do what I can.

     KIRYK
     I'll be close by.

   [He leaves the cave as Keller prepares a bag of solution.]

   EXT--CAVE ENTRANCE, NIGHT

   [Kiryk looks around, upset before he schools his emotions and walks
   away.]

   INT--CAVE

   [Celise awakens as Keller finishes bandaging her leg. She looks at
   Keller, frightened as Keller realizes she's awake.]

     KELLER
     Oh, it-it's okay. It's okay. I'm here to help you. I gave you some
     medicine to numb your leg. Do you feel any pain?

   [Celise clutches a small rag doll and shakes her head.]

     KELLER

     (sighing)
     Good. That's good.

     CELISE

     (weakly)
     Where's Kiryk?

     KELLER
     Kiryk. So that's his name. He's just outside. Keeping watch and
     making sure you're safe, okay?

   [Celise nods.]

     KELLER
     That's a beautiful doll.

     CELISE
     Kiryk made it for me.

     KELLER
     Wow, mean ol' Kiryk, huh? Go figure.

     CELISE
     He's not mean. He just pretends to be.

     KELLER
     I know someone just like him.

   [She smiles at the girl.]

   EXT--FOREST, NIGHT

   [Ronon and McKay track through the dark woods.]

     MCKAY
     The signal's circling. Wherever he's taking her, I think they've
     arrived.

     RONON
     How long before daybreak?

     MCKAY
     Ah, not long now. Maybe under an hour? It's pretty short.

   [Ronon stops McKay's forward moment, then silently draws his weapon.
   They peek around the corner at the Wraith standing in the trail, not
   moving and not facing them. Ronon stands, watching with interest.]

     MCKAY

     (whispering)
     What are you doing? Shoot it!

   [Ronon cautiously moves forward with his gun. McKay follows with his
   own sidearm drawn. Ronon places the barrel against the Wraith's head.]

     RONON
     Don't move.

   [The Wraith does not move...in fact does not even startle at Ronon's
   presence. Ronon circles around and sees the Wraith has been caught in
   one of Kiryk's traps, impaled upright. He chuckles and lowers his gun.
   McKay circles around and stares in horror.]

     RONON
     One less trap to worry about.

     MCKAY
     Is that supposed to be comforting?

   [They move off.]

   EXT--CAVE ENTRANCE, DAWN

   [Keller steps outside the cave, looking around. Kiryk shows up behind
   her. She turns and is startled by his sudden, close proximity.]

     KELLER

     (gasping)
     Oh! You scared me.

     KIRYK
     How is she?

     KELLER
     I debrided the wound, cleaned it as best I could, but...she's not
     out of danger, not by a long shot. She needs a much stronger
     antibiotic regimen, not to mention the probability of a skin graft.
     I'd like to take her to Atlantis. Our infirmary can provide her with
     the proper care she needs.

     KIRYK
     I can't go to Atlantis.

     KELLER
     I know. You're going to have to...trust me with her care.

   [Kiryk stiffens.]

     KIRYK
     As long as you return her to me when...she's healed.

     KELLER
     Kiryk, you have to understand something. There's no guarantee she's
     going to survive this, she's still very sick. But if she
     survives...being constantly hunted by the Wraith is no life for a
     child. You know that. If you really want her to live, you need to
     let her go.

     KIRYK
     If I knew that she would--

   [He pauses, hearing something behind them.]

     KELLER

     (alert)
     What is it?

   [Kiryk shoves Keller into hiding in the foliage, then moves off,
   checking his armband. A few seconds later, two Wraith approach the
   cave. Kiryk materializes, with his sword drawn. He catches them by
   surprise, slicing the one open. The other is able to strike back before
   he can fight it, knocking Kiryk to the ground and disarming him. Kiryk
   disappears as the Wraith presses his advantage. He looks around. Kiryk
   rematerializes behind him and punches him in the kidney area, then
   picks up his sword and kills the Wraith. Kiryk is then felled by a
   stunner blast by a third, hidden Wraith. It approaches its prey.]

     CELISE

     (calling from in cave)
     Kiryk?

   [The Wraith turns to the cave.]

   INT--CAVE

   [The Wraith approaches Celise, who lies helpless on the bed. It falls
   dead as it's impaled by Kiryk's sword. Keller lets go of the hilt as
   the Wraith falls. Still in shock, she runs to Celise and embraces her,
   staring at the entrance.]

   EXT--FOREST CLEARING, DAY

   [Kiryk awakens to find himself lying in a clearing. Keller is nearby
   with Celise, checking the girl's vitals. Kiryk groans as he tries to
   move.]

     KIRYK
     What happened?

     KELLER
     A Wraith stunned you. Almost killed Celise. I couldn't revive you.
     They must've hit you with a triple dose of whatever's in those
     stunners. Anyway, I knew we had to get away from the cave, so I
     carried Celise here, and then I went back and literally dragged you
     the distance. Not an easy task, let me tell you.

   [While Keller is speaking, Kiryk struggles to his feet. His muscles are
   still stiff and weak, his balance wobbly.]

     KIRYK
     How is she?

     KELLER
     Stable, for the time being, but...her fever is still very high. The
     longer she stays on this planet, the greater the danger.

     KIRYK
     I'll carry her. We'll head back for the 'gate.

     KELLER
     With the Wraith closing in on us? How far do you think we're going
     to get?

     KIRYK
     A lot farther than you trying to carry her yourself.

   [Keller licks her lips and pulls a device from nearby.]

     KELLER
     Okay, look, I've been thinking. I may not be able to remove the
     tracking device, but there might be a way to disable it. This
     machine...is called a defibrillator. It creates a powerful electric
     shock to restore someone's heart to the proper rhythm. And I think,
     if I can place the paddles on the skin directly above your tracking
     device? I might be able to overload the power source--fry the
     circuits.

     KIRYK

     (steeling himself)
     All right, do it.

     KELLER
     Okay, but you should know, that there's no guarantees that this is
     going to work, and it also carries a lot of risk.

     KIRYK
     Well, if it works, the device will be disabled. If it kills me, same
     thing. The Wraith won't be able to track me anymore... It's time to
     stop running.

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [McKay studies the scanner.]

     MCKAY
     It's not too much further.

   [Ronon pulls his gun and breaks into a run. McKay hurries to keep up.]

     MCKAY
     Hey!

   EXT--CLEARING, DAY

   [Kiryk brushes the hair from the sleeping Celise's forehead.]

     KIRYK
     Promise me you'll make sure she's cared for.

     KELLER
     I promise.

   [Kiryk stands and strips off his top. Keller stares at the scars on his
   back.]

     KELLER
     Okay. The charge moves from one paddle to the other, and your
     tracking device is going to be directly between them, okay?

   [Kiryk breathes deeply. She tapes one paddle to the center of his
   chest.]

     KELLER
     All right.

   [He lies on his stomach. Keller places the other paddle on his back.]

     KELLER
     Ready?

   [He nods. She sets the charge to 360 joules.]

     KELLER
     Okay, here we go.

   [She shocks him. He grunts in pain, then collapses limply.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

     MCKAY
     What the hell?

     RONON
     What?

     MKCAY
     I don't know. It just...it suddenly stopped transmitting. We lost
     them!

   [Ronon glowers, then keeps moving.]

   EXT--CLEARING, DAY

   [Keller has moved Kiryk onto his back and is performing CPR.]

     KELLER

     (desperately)
     Oh, come on!

   [She injects him with a syringe. She checks for a pulse. He suddenly
   gasps and retches, starting to sit up. She holds him down.]

     KELLER
     Okay?

     KIRYK
     What--what happened?

     KELLER
     I lost you for a moment, but...you're back in the land of the
     living.

   [She reaches for her scanner.]

     KIRYK
     Did it work?

   [She scans him.]

     KELLER
     I think so. The device isn't transmitting any signals. I think we
     successfully fried the sucker.

   [She smiles--but her smile falters as she looks down.]

     KELLER
     Oh no.

     KIRYK
     What?

     KELLER
     I guess it fried that too.

   [She gestures to the armband that has fallen off his arm, the crystal
   light blue.]

     KIRYK
     It doesn't matter. Don't need it anymore.

   [He moves to toss it away.]

     KELLER
     Actually...I know someone who would love to inspect a gadget like
     that.

   [He hands her the armband.]

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Ronon has stopped; he is crouched down and looks somber.]

     MCKAY

     Anything?
     (notices Ronon's somber expression)
     What?

     RONON
     A body was dragged through here.

   [Ronon moves off as McKay looks worried.]

   EXT--CLEARING, DAY

   [Ronon grunts as he enters the clearing.]

     MCKAY

     (breathless)
     You got something?

     RONON
     Yeah. Two bodies laid here. Ground cover's trampled in two spots.

     MCKAY
     So the Wraith got to them before we did?

     RONON
     I don't think so. I don't see any Wraith footprints anywhere.

     MCKAY
     Well, so what happened? What, they killed each other?

     RONON
     No one's dead. At least they weren't when they were here. Look. One
     body was dragged through here, by Keller. Her footprints.

     MCKAY
     Ah, so she killed him. Probably in the process of disabling his
     tracking device.

     RONON
     Nah, she didn't kill him. He was unconscious. His footprints,
     side-by-side with hers, leaving the clearing that way.

   [Ronon points.]

     MCKAY

     (dubious)
     So, what, she brought him here unconscious, revived him, and they
     left together?

     RONON
     Looks like it.

     MCKAY
     Hey, wait a second. You said there were two bodies. So what, she
     took a nap?

     RONON
     No. Too small for Keller. My guess is someone else is with them.
     Probably a child.

     MCKAY
     But no footprints?

   [Ronon crouches down where Celise had lain.]

     RONON
     No. She was carried here.

     MCKAY

     (scoffing)
     She? How could possibly know the kid was a girl?

   [Ronon holds up Celise's doll with its red dress.]

     MCKAY
     Oh.

   [They hear darts passing overhead.]

     RONON
     Darts.

     MCKAY
     Looks like we're not the only ones who noticed his signal died.

   [Ronon and McKay take off down the trail again.]

   EXT--TOP OF CLIFF, DAY

   [Kiryk carries Celise over his shoulder. Both he and Keller are moving
   slowly.]

     KELLER

     (out of breath)
     Could sure use that teleportation device now.

     KIRYK
     There's a path down not too far from here. Stay here. I'll check to
     make sure it's still safe.

   [He leaves Celise with Keller. She fusses with the child's blankets.
   Kiryk moves to a shallower slope and looks down. Ronon tackles him from
   behind. They fight hand-to-hand. Keller looks up, hearing the
   commotion.]

     KELLER
     Ronon? Ronon, wait!

   [McKay comes up behind Keller.]

     MCKAY
     Jennifer?

     KELLER

     (upset)
     Make him stop!

     MCKAY
     What? Why?

   [Ronon and Kiryk continue to fight.]

     KELLER

     (screaming, frantic)
     Ronon, please STOP!
     (to McKay)
     Help me. Grab her!

   [She leaves Celise with McKay and runs to the battle. She reaches them
   just as Ronon's pulled his gun, and Kiryk's unsheathed his sword. They
   hold their respective weapons at each other's throats.]

     KELLER
     Stop!

   [Keller grabs onto both of them.]

     KELLER
     Listen, he just wanted me to help the little girl. She's sick! She's
     dying! We need to get her back to Atlantis! Ronon! Please?

   [Ronon sneers, then lowers his gun. After another moment, Kiryk lowers
   his blade.]

     MCKAY
     Jennifer, the-the--

   [He points to Celise's leg. There is heavy bleeding through the
   bandages. Keller immediately goes to the child.]

     KELLER
     Her sutures have torn. I need to re-stitch her before we can move
     her.

   [They can hear darts flying nearby.]

     RONON
     You've got Wraith looking for you.

     KIRYK
     I know.

     MCKAY
     Listen, you stand a better chance fighting them together than
     fighting each other...

   [Both men glare at him.]

     MCKAY

     (stammering)
     I mean, obviously the odds of actually winning are still
     ridiculously low, but--

     KELLER
     Not helping.

     MCKAY

     (mumbling)
     I gotta go--

   [He points to where the packs were left and shuffles away.]

     RONON
     He's right. This place is going to be swarming with Wraith. It's
     better off if we work together.

   [He steps away from Kiryk, leaving him clear access to his stunner,
   which had fallen during the battle. Kiryk holsters his gun.]

   [Keller quickly finishes re-stitching and re-bandaging the wound.]

     KELLER
     All right, she's ready.

     RONON
     Let's go.

   [McKay starts picking up the packs and Kiryk picks up Celise. Ronon
   spots Wraith running towards them.]

     RONON
     Wraith!

   [He immediately starts fighting one who's come on him quickly. Another
   one rushes at McKay who fires his hand gun but cannot stop the Wraith's
   approach.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, crap!

   [The Wraith pins him against a rock and sets up to feed.]

     MCKAY
     RONON!

   [Ronon is fighting off two Wraith hand-to-hand and cannot help. Keller
   hits McKay's Wraith with a stick, distracting him from McKay as prey
   and uses the stick to block further attacks. McKay fumbles to reload
   his gun as Kiryk helps Ronon fight the other Wraith.]

     KELLER
     Shoot him!

     MCKAY
     I will!

   [McKay finally has his pistol ready and fires several times. The Wraith
   falls. Kiryk is able to kill one Wraith with his sword just as Ronon
   knocks the other one to the ground. Ronon holds out his hand, and Kiryk
   throws his sword to Ronon. Ronon plunges the blade into the Wraith and
   twists it. They look around, but there are no more enemies. Celise has
   slept through it all.]

     MCKAY

     (nonplussed, to Keller)
     Where'd you learn to fight like that?

     KELLER

     (awkwardly)
     Uh...been taking a few sparring lessons.

   [She gestures to Ronon.]

     MCKAY

     (flatly)
     Oh.

   [More darts are heard overhead. Ronon pulls out Kiryk's sword.]

     RONON
     We need to move.

   [The group walk through the woods.]

     KELLER
     I tried to stabilize her, but she needs stronger medication.

     MCKAY
     You know, you could've just asked for her assistance as opposed
     to...kidnapping her!

     KELLER
     He knows, Rodney. Here, I got you something.

   [She pulls out Kiryk's armband from her pack.]

     KELLER
     It's a kind of teleportation device.

     MCKAY
     Teleportation? Really?

     KELLER
     Well, it was, anyway. I kind of broke it.

   [McKay pulls out a small screwdriver and starts playing with the device
   as he walks. Up ahead, Ronon walks with Kiryk, who carries Celise.]

     RONON
     Is she family?

     KIRYK
     I brought the Wraith to her village. She's the sole survivor.

     RONON

     (empathetic)
     It's not easy...living with that.

   [Kiryk shoots him a look.]

     RONON
     Don't worry. We're going to get you out of this...both of you.

   EXT--RISE OVER STARGATE AREA, DAY

   [The group reach an elevated area overlooking the Stargate. They see
   Wraith guarding the Stargate. Kiryk sits Celise down. She's awake, but
   groggy.]

     RONON
     I count six Wraith on the ground.

     KIRYK
     Six that we can see. Probably more in the surrounding woods.

     RONON
     Want to make a run for it? Shoot our way through?

     KIRYK
     The ships will be alerted as soon as the shooting starts. We'll be
     culled before we can even dial.

     RONON
     We're just going to have to take our chances.

   [The armband beeps.]

     MCKAY

     (pleased)
     Hey!

     KELLER
     You fixed it!

     MCKAY
     I don't know about "fixed", it's more of a "patch" really. It's
     incredibly complicated technology. I'm not sure if it'll actually--

   [Kiryk grabs the armband out of McKay's hand.]

     MCKAY
     Hey! What're you doing?

     KIRYK
     I'm going to improve our chances.

   [He places the armband on his forearm, where it fuses itself. The light
   turns green.]

     KELLER
     Don't go down there by yourself.

     KIRYK

     I'll be fine.
     (to Ronon)
     Get ready to attack that clearing.

   [Ronon stands watch.]

     MCKAY
     Look, just-just-just, wait a second. All right? Look, I'm not sure
     if I've actually fixed it. You'll need to test it before you
     actually.

   [Kiryk presses the button and disappears.]

     MCKAY
     Huh. I guess I did fix it.

   EXT--STARGATE AREA, DAY

   [A Wraith soldier patrols the wood near the Stargate. Kiryk
   materializes and kills the Wraith before it realizes he's there. He
   disappears, then reappears near the DHD, taking out the guard there and
   using his gun to down two more.]

   EXT--RISE ABOVE STARGATE, DAY

   [They see Kiryk fighting.]

     MCKAY
     He's at the 'gate!

     RONON
     Stay with them!

   [Ronon runs to join Kiryk. McKay draws his sidearm.]

   EXT--STARGATE AREA, DAY

   [Kiryk is pinned down at the DHD in a firefight. He dials the Stargate
   between shots.]

   EXT--RISE ABOVE STARGATE, DAY

     KELLER
     He's dialing the 'gate.

   EXT--STARGATE AREA, DAY

   [Kiryk dials the last chevron, activating the Stargate. More Wraith
   reinforcements run towards the Stargate as Kiryk shoots cover fire and
   escapes through it. The Wraith give chase, including two darts. Ronon
   arrives just as the wormhole shuts down.]

   EXT--RISE ABOVE STARGATE, DAY

   [Keller and McKay share sorrowful looks.]

     KELLER
     We've got to get a move on.

     MCKAY
     All right. Well, we'll take her to the 'gate, then I'll go back,
     tell people it's safe to return to the village.

   [Keller nods.]

   EXT--STARGATE AREA, DAY

   [Ronon stares regretfully at the inactive Stargate.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Celise sits up in an infirmary bed, playing a duck hunter video game
   on a handheld computer. McKay hovers by her side.]

     MCKAY
     Uh, no, no. As-as they fly up, you want to-want to use that button
     there to shoot them.

     CELISE

     (scandalized)
     Shoot the ducks?

     MCKAY
     They're not real ducks, obviously. They're just, you know, for
     pretend...

   [He looks to Keller for help. She's studying Celise's monitors.]

     KELLER
     Maybe you should show her a different game.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, yeah. Sure. Here.

   [McKay takes the computer to pull up a different game. Sheppard and
   Ronon arrive.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, how's our little patient?

     KELLER
     Oh, much better. She's a heck of a fighter.

     SHEPPARD

     (to Celise, pointing to McKay)
     Is he bothering you? Because, I can have him removed, forcibly.

     CELISE
     Really?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, he's kidding.

     KELLER
     I talked to one of the families on 985, the woman's home we visited?
     She'd love to have Celise come and live with them.

     RONON
     That's great.

     CELISE
     Will I see Kiryk again?

   [The others exchange awkward looks.]

     KELLER
     I don't know, sweetheart.

     SHEPPARD
     We're still looking for him. Keeping our eyes and ears open.

     RONON

     (smiling)
     Hey, I brought you something. I think you dropped this in the woods.

   [He holds out Celise's doll. Her eyes light up and she takes it.]

     CELISE
     My doll!

   [Ronon and Keller exchange smiles. McKay watches their interaction with
   discouraged interest.]

   INT--ATLANTIS WORKOUT ROOM

   [Ronon twirls a staff around in a loose kada movement. McKay enters.]

     RONON
     What?

     MCKAY
     Okay, here's the thing. I-I've been thinking, and, uh...I need to
     know your intentions.

     RONON

     (puzzled)
     Intentions?

     MCKAY
     With Jennifer.

     RONON
     I don't have any intentions.

     MCKAY

     (surprised)
     Oh. Okay.

   [He turns to go, suppressing a smile.]

     MCKAY

     (under his breath)
     Good.

     RONON
     Wait.

   [McKay turns back.]

     RONON
     What do you mean by "intentions"?

     MCKAY
     I mean, are you interested in her in a...romantic...fashion?

     RONON
     No.

     MCKAY
     Good!

   [He turns to go. Ronon leans on his staff.]

     RONON
     Wait.

   [McKay spins back.]

     MCKAY

     (angry)
     What?

     RONON
     Maybe I do...have...intentions.

     MCKAY

     (grumbling softly)
     Oh.

     RONON
     Do you have intentions?

     MCKAY
     Yes, well of course I do. That's why I was asking you.

     RONON

     (shrugging)
     So what are we going to do about it?

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     I don't know.

   [Ronon smiles and starts shifting his staff.]

     MCKAY
     I'm not going to fight you for her, if that's what you're thinking.

     RONON
     Great.

     MCKAY
     I'm not going to step aside either! So...we're just going to have
     to...let her decide.

   [Ronon is still smirking.]

     RONON
     Okay.

     MCKAY

     (with bravado)
     Okay. So, may the best man win.

   [McKay steps forward and holds out his hand to shake. Ronon, still
   smiling, takes it. McKay swallows, uncertain.]

   FADE OUT
