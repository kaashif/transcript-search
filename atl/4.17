   TEASER

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard and Teyla sit with Carter in her office.]

     CARTER
     Welcome back, Teyla.

     TEYLA
     Thank you. Believe me, it's good to be back.

     SHEPPARD
     So, what's new on Earth?

     TEYLA
     I...wouldn't know. I saw nothing beyond the walls of Stargate
     Command for two days.

     CARTER
     How'd the interview go?

     TEYLA
     Exactly as you said it would. The new member of the IOA, Mister
     Coolidge? Was somewhat brusque and arrogant. He insisted on doing
     most of the questioning himself.

     CARTER
     Yeah, I thought he would. These interviews were the first item on
     his agenda.

     SHEPPARD
     Don't worry, just a new guy marking his territory.

     TEYLA
     Yes, well, he is clearly distrustful of "aliens" participating in
     any aspect of the Stargate Program, let alone being active team
     members.

     SHEPPARD
     But you changed his mind, right?

     TEYLA
     I...hope so. Although he did seem...distracted by my current
     condition.

     CARTER

     (surprised)
     Really? I informed the IOA of your pregnancy.

     TEYLA
     Yes. They knew. And most of the members were actually quite
     supportive. But Mr. Coolidge...his demeanor toward women differs
     from his demeanor toward men. He kept calling me "honey."

   [Carter groans softly and bites her lip.]

     TEYLA
     I admit the urge to inflict harm on this man was quite strong, but I
     managed to refrain from doing so.

     SHEPPARD
     Good call. Bad idea to run around beating the crap out of people
     with a baby on the way.

     TEYLA
     In the end, I don't think he'll have a problem with me, mainly
     because I think he believes I will not be returning to active duty
     after my child is born.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, won't he be surprised?

   [Teyla shifts uncomfortably. Sheppard studies her reaction with
   surprise.]

     CARTER

     (quickly)
     Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime,
     it's important that we get through these interviews as smoothly as
     possible and not create any waves. I'll inform you when the report
     comes in.

     TEYLA
     Thank you.

   [Teyla leaves. Sheppard stands, but sits again when Carter sits next to
   him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

     CARTER

     (sighing)
     Ronon's up next.

     SHEPPARD
     Big waves. We're talking tsunamis.

     CARTER
     I thought about that. Now, his interview's not for three days, so
     I've asked somebody to come to Atlantis and..."coach" him.

     SHEPPARD
     Who?

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c, wearing formal Jaffa robes, arrives through the Stargate and
   looks around Atlantis. Carter walks up to greet him, smiling broadly.]

     CARTER
     Teal'c!

   [They clasp hands warmly.]

     TEAL'C
     Colonel Carter.

     CARTER
     Welcome to Atlantis.

   [Teal'c bows. Carter laughs.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Teal'c walk down a corridor. She's studying his latest
   hairstyle. He still has the silver streak from his aging, but it has
   grown longer now, and is slicked back.]

     CARTER
     So, Teal'c, the, uh...hair.

     TEAL'C
     You do not like it?

     CARTER
     No, I love it. It's very...Earth.

   [They grin at each other.]

     TEAL'C
     This city is much larger than I expected.

     CARTER
     Ah, it's a remarkable feat of engineering. The Ancients really knew
     what they were doing.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [Carter smiles at passers-by and looks at the city. Teal'c studies her
   and gives a faint smile.]

     TEAL'C
     You look well, Colonel Carter. Command has been good to you.

     CARTER
     Thanks, Teal'c. It takes some getting used to. The military
     protocol's pretty relaxed, but I like it here.

   INT--WORKOUT ROOM

   [Ronon spars with a large Marine in hand to hand combat, Ronon
   constantly knocking the other down. Other Atlantis personnel are on the
   sidelines watching. Carter and Teal'c enter. Ronon fells the Marine for
   the last time, then adjusts some of his dreadlocks out of his face.]

     TEAL'C
     Is that him?

     CARTER
     Yep. That's him. Come on.

   [Ronon goes to get something to drink while people help the injured man
   off the mats. Carter and Teal'c approach Ronon.]

     CARTER
     Ronon Dex, I'd like you to meet Teal'c of the Jaffa. He's the one I
     was telling you about.

     TEAL'C

     (bowing)
     It is a pleasure to meet you, Ronon Dex. Colonel Carter has spoken
     highly of you.

   [Ronon is slightly out of breath as he continues to drink his water. He
   studies Teal'c with a scowl.]

     CARTER

     (nervously)
     Anyway...like I said. You two are similar in many ways, so you
     should have a lot in common.

   [Carter and Teal'c watch as Ronon spits out some of his water.]

     CARTER

     (continuing gamely)
     Teal'c was a member of SG-1 for over ten years, so he knows all
     about dealing with the IOA. Which is why I thought...he could pass
     along a few pointers, help you prep for the big interview.

   [Ronon continues to glare at Teal'c, who studies Ronon with an
   appraising eye.]

     TEAL'C

     (blandly)
     Colonel Carter?

     CARTER

     (sighing weakly)
     Yeah?

     TEAL'C
     Perhaps you could leave us to become better acquainted.

   [Carter looks between them.]

     CARTER

     (tensely)
     Sure. Have fun.

   [She leaves. They continue to stare each other down.]

     TEAL'C
     Do you not speak, Ronon Dex?

     RONON
     Not when I've got nothin' to say.

   [Teal'c blinks, considering this, then bows his head.]

   EXT--M4F-788, DAY

   [In a desert canyon. The Wraith who was part of the lab where Todd was
   held walks towards the DHD. A hive ship is in the distance. He is
   followed by other Wraith and some soldier Wraith. One carries a large
   circular device, others carry tendons that are the Wraith version of
   cables.]

     WRAITH
     This is it. Get to work!

   [They start setting up their device and connecting it to the DHD.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Ronon sits alone at a table, eating. Teal'c arrives with his own tray
   full of food.]

     TEAL'C
     May I join you?

   [Teal'c sits without waiting for an answer. Ronon appears annoyed.]

     TEAL'C
     Mm. Salisbury steak. We are often served this in the SGC mess hall.
     I must confess, however, that I am partial to the tater tots.

     RONON
     Look. I don't need a coach teaching me how to act during the
     interview. I've dealt with the IOA before.

     TEAL'C
     The IOA is comprised of more than just Mr. Woolsey. Their new
     member, Mr. Coolidge is far less pleasant.

     RONON
     Yeah, well, I can handle him. I'll stay calm, answer all of his
     questions. I know how to play the game.

     TEAL'C
     I am pleased to hear that. Very well. Let us speak of other things.

     RONON
     Such as?

     TEAL'C
     Tell me of Sateda.

   [Ronon stops chewing and glares at Teal'c.]

     RONON

     (aggressively)
     What do you want to know?

     TEAL'C
     When did the Wraith destroy it?

     RONON

     (calming)
     Years ago.

     TEAL'C
     Your army was unable to fight?

     RONON

     (bristling)
     Oh, we fought back. The battle lasted days.

     TEAL'C
     And when you finally surrendered, what did the Wraith do then--?

     RONON

     (hissing)
     We didn't surrender! We fought until every last one of us was either
     dead or captured.

     TEAL'C
     So tell me then...is it true that negligence on your part is what
     first alerted the Wraith to your presence? That your reckless
     actions brought about the deaths of thousands of innocent people--

   [Ronon stands and tosses aside his tray in his fury. He unholsters his
   gun and powers it up, aiming it at Teal'c's head.]

     RONON
     That's a lie!

   [While everyone has gotten up, upset and confused at the scene, Teal'c
   has remained seated, perfectly calm, and eating a tater tot.]

     TEAL'C
     Indeed it is. Yet, should such a question arise during your
     interview, I trust you will not respond in a similar manner. You do,
     after all, "know how to play the game."

   [The door opens and Sheppard enters, taking in the scene.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon! Put...the gun...away!

   [Ronon re-holsters his gun, but continues to glare down at Teal'c.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's the problem here?

     TEAL'C
     There is no problem, Colonel Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, that's good to hear. Ronon?

   [Ronon leans over the table, menacingly. Teal'c stops eating and stares
   back in challenge. Sheppard shifts, sensing the tension.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right...why don't you take Teal'c down to the gym? Show him your
     fighting techniques? I'm sure you guys could give each other a few
     tips.

   INT--WORK OUT ROOM

   [Teal'c and Ronon fight in the center of the room with large staffs.
   Teal'c has taken off his robes and is in sleeveless top and pants.
   Atlantis personnel line the edges, cheering the fighters on. Chuck has
   a PDA and is collecting money in a betting pool. Carter enters and
   walks over to Sheppard, who's watching calmly.]

     SHEPPARD
     Colonel? Want to place a bet?

     CARTER
     What's going on here?

     SHEPPARD
     Friendly sparring match.

   [They watch as Teal'c and Ronon swing their staffs. Neither seem to be
   holding back, and neither gives any quarter.]

     CARTER
     Well, it looks anything but friendly.

     SHEPPARD
     Nah, it's good for them. They're just blowing off some steam.

   [Teal'c and Ronon continue to fight at a furious pace.]

     CROWD
     Go! Go! Go!

     CARTER
     How long have they been at it?

     SHEPPARD
     About an hour or so.

     CARTER

     (incredulous)
     An hour?!

     SHEPPARD
     They're not even taking any breaks.

     CARTER
     Well, they are now!

     SHEPPARD
     I don't think that's such a...

   [Carter jumps into the fray.]

     SHEPPARD
     ...good idea.

   [Ronon kicks and Teal'c's staff breaks in the middle, leaving him with
   two rods now. Carter steps into the fight circle.]

     CARTER
     Okay! That's enough!

   [The cheering stops and Teal'c and Ronon pace around. Teal'c stares at
   Carter, then drops his two sticks. Ronon sneers and drops his own
   staff. Sheppard's eyes widen.]

   [Ronon starts punching Teal'c. After a few blows, Teal'c fights back,
   knocking Ronon to one side. Ronon bounces to renew his attack.]

     CARTER
     Ronon! Teal'c! Stop!

   [She steps between them and physically holds them apart.]

     SHEPPARD

     (disappointed)
     Well.

     CARTER
     Let's call it a draw.

   [The crowd dissipates. Sheppard takes some Canadian money from Chuck's
   hand, leaving him a small bill, then walks away himself.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Carter and Teal'c, now back in his Jaffa robes, walk down a corridor.
   Not in hearing distance, Sheppard walks with Ronon. He points to
   Teal'c.]

     RONON

     (petulantly)
     Why does he have to go with me?

     SHEPPARD
     He's not actually going with you. He's returning home. He just
     happens to be traveling at the same time. One less dial-in on the
     intergalactic bridge.

     RONON
     That's the other thing. Why don't we just dial Earth directly from
     here?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we need a ZPM for that, and we don't want to waste the extra
     power. That was the whole point of the Gate Bridge in the first
     place.

     RONON
     But there's a twenty-four hour quarantine on the Midway Station.

   [Sheppard and Ronon pause at the door to the Gate Room. Teal'c and
   Carter already stand before the Stargate.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you're just going to have to sit around for a bit, all right?
     Look, the guy's got years of experience. He's like a hundred years
     old or something, all right? It won't kill you to listen to him. Be
     a good boy.

   [Sheppard walks away.]

     RONON
     I hate you.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

     CARTER
     I'm sorry about breaking up the sparring match earlier. But if I
     didn't, you two would probably still be fighting.

   [Teal'c nods and bows.]

     CARTER
     Listen, I know that Ronon's been resistant, but I really appreciate
     you coming here and helping us out.

     RONON
     I too wish him to succeed. There is great potential in him.

     CARTER
     I agree.

   [Ronon approaches.]

     CARTER

     (to Ronon)
     All set?

     RONON
     Let's get this over with.

   [Carter and Teal'c exchange looks, she with a too-bright smile.]

     CARTER

     (calling to Control Room)
     Dial the bridge, Chuck.

     CHUCK
     Yes, ma'am.

     TEAL'C
     It gives me great pride to see how the people of this expedition
     have embraced you as their leader. As I knew they would.

     CARTER
     Thanks, Teal'c.

   [They embrace. Ronon rolls his eyes and looks away.]

   EXT--M4F-788, DAY

   [The Stargate activates as the Wraith recheck the tendon cables.]

     WRAITH AIDE
     The portal's activating. The patterns are stored in the buffer. The
     portal should redial momentarily.

   [The aide presses controls.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Midway Station floats between the Pegasus and Milky Way
   galaxies.</blockquote>

     LEE
     Incoming Pegasus Activation.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION GATE ROOM

   [Teal'c and Ronon step onto the ramp. Two guards stand nearby. The
   Milky Way Stargate is at the the other side of the room.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [Lee watches Teal'c and Ronon through a window. Kavanaugh and Dempster
   sit at separate control consoles.]

     LEE

     (to Kavanaugh)
     Right on schedule. I'm gonna go get them settled in. You can get
     started on the attitude stabilization diagnostics.

     KAVANAUGH
     I thought Dempster was doing that.

     DEMPSTER
     Why do I have to do that?

     LEE
     You don't. I want you to do it.

   [He points at Kavanaugh.]

     KAVANAUGH
     I just finished five hours of power distribution upgrades!

     LEE
     You chose to be here.

     KAVANAUGH
     No, I didn't.

     LEE
     Yes, you did.

     KAVANAUGH
     No, I didn't!

     LEE
     Regardless...I want you to learn everything there is to know about
     this station. And the sooner you do that, the sooner I get to hand
     you reins and go home.

   [Lee leaves.]

     KAVANAUGH

     (petulant)
     You're not the only one who wants to go home.

     LEE

     (calling back)
     I heard that!

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [Lee meets Teal'c and Ronon in the corridor.]

     LEE

     (brightly)
     Gentlemen! Welcome to the Midway Station, halfway point between the
     Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies.

     RONON
     Yeah, we know. We've been here before.

     LEE

     (nervously)
     Right. Of course. So then you also know about the twenty-four hour
     quarantine before we can let you carry on to Earth? Don't want to
     pass on any of those pesky Pegasus germs to the folks back home...
     (clears throat)
     Why-why don't I just show you to your quarters? Um, unfortunately,
     you're gonna have to share. As you know, there's not much room on
     the station.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION GUEST QUARTERS

   [Lee opens a door. It has a bunk-bed, a small table, a toilet and sink.
   Teal'c looks around practically in horror at how small it is. Ronon
   looks annoyed.]

     LEE
     There's a dvd player and a few movies. Oh, we saw Norbit the other
     day? It's actually--it's kind of funny. Um, there's some sudoku
     books...although I think--no, they're all solved. Um, yeah, like I
     said, it-it-it's a bit small, but uh, you're only here for a day, so
     kick back, relax, have a-have an Earl Grey and get to know each
     other better...or not.

   [Lee is squeezed between the much larger Teal'c and Ronon. As they look
   at their cramped quarters, Lee is pressed between them while he speaks.
   Lee is able to maneuver to the door and makes a hasty retreat. Ronon
   and Teal'c glare at each other a few moments, then both move to take
   the bottom bunk. They stand as one and stare each other down again.]

   EXT--M4F-788, DAY

   [The Wraith aide finishes typing on his console.]

     WRAITH AIDE
     I have deciphered the program.

     WRAITH
     Prepare the first wave!

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [Lee rejoins Kavanaugh and Dempster.]

     LEE
     How's it going?

     KAVANAUGH

     (dully)
     Peachy.

     LEE
     You're bored. I get it. Welcome to Midway.

   [The Pegasus Stargate activates.]

     KAVANAUGH
     Are we expecting another dial-in?

     LEE
     No.

   [He goes to Dempster's console and keys the intercom.]

     LEE
     Unscheduled Pegasus activation.

   [He looks at the computer screen of a camera at the Stargate and
   watches the two guards wait. Wraith soldiers come through the Stargate
   and immediately fire at the guards.]

     LEE
     What the heck?

     KAVANAUGH
     Oh, God! Wraith!

     LEE
     That's impossible!

   [They all rush to the window to see several Wraith soldiers coming
   through the Stargate.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION GUEST QUARTERS

   [Ronon and Teal'c stand stoically and watch the Three Stooges on the tv
   screen mounted to the wall.]

     MOE

     (on screen)
     Ah, who you hitting?

   [Moe hits Larry between the eyes. Larry runs away.]

     CURLY

     (on screen)
     Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

     MOE
     Eh, be quiet.

   [Moe smacks Curly up the back of the head.]

   [Neither Ronon nor Teal'c react to the onscreen antics. A klaxon begins
   to blare. Ronon and Teal'c exchange looks. Ronon grabs his gun belt
   from the top bunk, and Teal'c takes off his robe as they leave.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDORS

   [Wraith soldiers patrol the halls, shooting the guards. Ronon and
   Teal'c encounter two soldiers; Ronon instantly fells them with his
   pistol.]

     RONON
     What are the Wraith doing here?

   [Teal'c picks up their stunner weapons.]

     TEAL'C
     I was about to ask the same question.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The blast shield closes over the window. The door opens and Wraith
   enter. Lee finishes frantically typing on the console while the other
   two raise their hands.]

     WRAITH
     Stop!

   [Lee stands and raises his hands in surrender, backing away. The aide
   takes his Lee's place at the console and turns off the klaxon. The
   Wraith leader watches the last soldiers enter and the Pegasus Stargate
   shut down.]

     WRAITH
     Dial Earth.

   [Lee gulps and he exchanges worried looks with his colleagues.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard enters. Carter and McKay are both working at computers.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's going on?

     MCKAY

     (unconcerned)
     The intergalactic bridge is down.

     SHEPPARD
     How'd that happen?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. We were sending the daily status report to the SGC,
     and we can't connect to Midway.

     CARTER
     Some kind of malfunction, either in one of the gates or the
     call-forwarding macro.

     MCKAY
     Eh, it's probably just a glitch, a simple software hiccup.

     SHEPPARD
     Hiccup?

     CARTER
     We hope.

     SHEPPARD

     (realizing)
     Ronon and Teal'c?

     MCKAY

     (dismissively)
     Nah, the malfunction occurred several minutes after they went
     through. I'm sure they made it to Midway.

     CARTER
     But we can't be absolutely certain.

   [Carter and McKay exchange stubborn looks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Those gates are in space! If they walked through...

     MCKAY
     No, no, no. Look, the glitch occurred at M4F-788. That is a
     planetary gate at the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy, which means,
     worst-case scenario, they step through the puddle and they find
     themselves stranded on an uninhabited planet.

     SHEPPARD
     Stranded. More time together. Just what they need.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Midway Station floats in space.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION ARMORY

   [Teal'c and Ronon raid the armory for weapons and ammunition.]

     RONON
     Oh. All right, we need to secure the gate room.

     TEAL'C
     No. We must get to the control room.

     RONON
     More Wraith can get through the Gate.

     TEALC
     They cannot use the Stargate without the Control Room. It is best if
     we just keep moving--

   [He exits the room and meets more Wraith. He shoots them both with his
   rifle. Ronon also fires at a pair coming from a different direction.]

     TEAL'C
     This way.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The computer beeps alerts as the aide tries to type commands.]

     WRAITH
     What's wrong?

     WRAITH AIDE
     I cannot activate the portal. A lockout command has been initiated.
     It is preventing me from accessing the controls.

     WRAITH
     Override it.

     WRAITH AIDE
     I'm trying...it requires a code.

   [The lead Wraith turns to Kavanaugh, Lee, and Dempster.]

     WRAITH
     What is the code?

     LEE

     (casually)
     We don't know.

   [The Wraith stalks towards them.]

     LEE
     Honestly, w-we don't know. There's only a handful of people who know
     that specific code for obvious security reasons, and uh...none of
     them are on the base right now, so...

     WRAITH
     You initiated the lockout?

   [Kavanaugh points to Lee.]

     LEE
     Well, it's not really a matter of who initiated it. It's a standard
     protocol--

     WRAITH

     (insistent)
     Did you?

     LEE

     (stammering)
     Yeah. But...I mean, well, yeah, it was me, but...like I said,
     initiating it and overriding it are two entirely separate--

     WRAITH
     Silence!

     LEE
     ...things.

   [The Wraith turns to his aide.]

     WRAITH

     (impatient)
     Keep working. Find a way around it.

     WRAITH AIDE
     It will take time. The interface has several...

     WRAITH

     The more you speak, the less time you have.
     (turning to his prisoners)
     In the meantime, perhaps I can find a way to persuade you to give me
     that code.

   [Lee looks at the Wraith, terrified.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [The Stargate activates.]

     CARTER
     We've got a lock.

     SHEPPARD
     Finally.

     MCKAY
     Yeah, it seems someone was dialing out from 788, which was
     preventing us from dialing in until now.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon and Teal'c?

     MCKAY
     Oh, I doubt it. Look, even if the malfunction spat them out on the
     planet, the only logical address they would dial is back to
     Atlantis, which, as we know, they didn't.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, maybe it's them, and they can't get a lock?

     CARTER

     (into radio)
     Ronon, Teal'c, are you there? Ronon, Teal'c, this is Colonel Carter,
     please respond.

     MCKAY
     I'm telling you they made it to the Midway Station before the
     malfunction; I'm sure of it.

   [Carter gives him a tense look.]

     SHEPPARD
     Wait a minute. Didn't you say 788 is uninhabited?

     MCKAY
     It is.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, if it's not Ronon and Teal'c, then who dialed out?

   [McKay gives him a blank look.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [A technician steers a MALP through the Stargate.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter and Sheppard watch the MALP telemetry on the big monitor while
   McKay sits at a console.]

     MCKAY
     The MALP is through. Receiving telemetry. Visual coming in now.

   [The screen shows empty rocks and sand.]

     MCKAY
     See? No Ronon, no Teal'c.

     CARTER
     Pan left.

   [McKay does so. The screen shows the Wraith tendrils and equipment by
   the DHD. Carter gasps.]

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     That's Wraith tech. It's hooked up to the DHD!

     CARTER
     Pan right.

   [McKay does so, then tilts the camera up. The hive ship is now visible
   at the edge of the canyon.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, crap.

   [A Wraith soldier appears and shoots the camera with his stunner. The
   screen blackens with a menu alert saying "no signal."]

     MCKAY
     We lost the feed.

     SHEPPARD
     Not to mention the MALP. Shut down the 'gate!

     CARTER
     Is it possible for them to have hijacked the Intergalactic Bridge?

     SHEPPARD
     This is a helluva lot more than a hiccup!

     MCKAY
     No, no, no. That' s impossible. In mean, first, they'd have to know
     about the bridge, and even if they did, there's too many security
     barriers in place. Look, the encryption I used on the
     call-forwarding macro would've them taken years to try to fig--

     SHEPPARD
     What if they knew the passwords?

     MCKAY
     How?

     SHEPPARD
     We just had a Wraith on base, Rodney, working with you, side by
     side, on your computers.

     MCKAY
     You mean Todd? He was our ally! Look, and even if he wanted to,
     there's no way he could hack into my system...could he?

     SHEPPARD
     You saw the tech hooked up to the DHD. What else could they be up
     to?

   [McKay looks disturbed.]

     CARTER
     All right, listen, we have to get to Midway. The Daedalus is back on
     Earth. Is there another way we can get there?

     MCKAY
     Well, connect to the bridge via another 'gate in Pegasus.

     CARTER
     We have to find one that's close to the outer edge.

   [McKay starts typing while Carter stares at the schematic.]

     MCKAY
     M6R-125. We could connect the bridge through that, but I'd need to
     reconfigure the macros.

     CARTER
     Okay. Get on it. Colonel, prepare a strike force.

   [She and Sheppard leave.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The Wraith drops Dempster's husk of corpse onto the floor after he's
   fed. Lee and Kavanaugh stare at the body of their colleague in horror.
   The Wraith stalks towards the pair.]

     KAVANAUGH
     H-honestly, if I knew the code, I would have given it to you by now!

     WRAITH
     That depends on the strength of your allegiance.

     KAVANAUGH
     No, no, no, trust me! My allegiance is not that strong.

     LEE

     (agreeing)
     It really isn't.

     KAVANAUGH
     Please, please! I'm begging you!

   [The Wraith raises his feeding hand; Kavanaugh collapses in a dead
   faint.]

     LEE
     Yeah, um, I think...he fainted.

     WRAITH
     Then you shall be next.

     LEE
     Okay, wait...

     WRAITH AIDE
     I've got it. I've successfully gained access to override the
     lockout.

   [The Wraith moves over to his aide.]

     WRAITH
     Good. Dial the portal.

   [The aide complies. Lee rubs his face with his hand, worried.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c and Ronon head down a corridor. They hear footsteps and see the
   shadows of approaching Wraith.]

     TEAL'C
     In here.

   [Ronon and Teal'c rush to a side corridor that holds space suits. They
   watch as the Wraith ascend the ladder.]

     RONON
     They're heading to the Gate Room.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

     RONON
     If you want to go to the control room, go ahead. I'm going after
     them.

   [Ronon chases after the Wraith.]

     TEAL'C
     Ronon!

   [Teal'c chases after Ronon.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

     WRAITH

     (via intercom)
     Send the device.

     LEE

     (clearing throat nervously)
     Device? Um, uh, what device?

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

     HARRIMAN
     Off-world activation. Midway's IDC. Opening the iris.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [A large ball with arcing blue light rolls down the ramp. Everyone
   stares at it curiously in both the Gate room and the control room. It
   lets off an energy wave burst. Everyone in the gate room, the control
   room, and the corridors and rooms beyond throughout the facility are
   knocked out as the wave passes. The ball shuts down.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard and Carter have returned. Sheppard is in full off-world
   combat gear. McKay shows them a schematic.]

     MCKAY
     All right, we're redirected. We gate from Atlantis to M6R-125. We
     insert this crystal with the bridge macros into the DHD, dial the
     first gate in the void, and we're back on track all the way to
     Midway.

     CARTER

     (to Sheppard)
     Is your strike force ready?

     SHEPPARD
     As soon as McKay gears up, we're ready to go.

     MCKAY

     Well, I'm-I'm uh...
     (sighing)
     All right, I-I'm gearing up.

   [He leaves. Sheppard and Carter exchange tight smiles.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

     WRAITH

     (into intercom)
     Prepare the next wave.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION GATE ROOM ANTECHAMBER

   [Ronon and Teal'c reach the antechamber and watch through the window as
   a group of soldiers march through the Milky Way Stargate.]

     TEAL'C
     They have dialed the Milky Way 'gate.

     RONON
     They're headed for Stargate Command.

     TEAL'C
     We must pursue them.

     RONON

     (elbowing him)
     Now you're talking.

   [They try to reach the Gate Room and get into a firefight with Wraith
   soldiers converging on their positions.]

     RONON
     Let's go before the gate shuts down!

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The lead Wraith watches as Teal'c and Ronon back their way up the
   ramp, firing at the Wraith soldiers.]

     WRAITH
     Shut it down! Now!

   [Ronon and Teal'c step through the Stargate just before it shuts down,
   leaving Wraith soldiers stranded on the ramp.]

     WRAITH
     Two were able to pass through, but they will be dispensed of soon
     enough. Make ready the next--

   [The Pegasus Stargate activates an incoming wormhole.]

     WRAITH TECH
     The Pegasus portal is activating.

     WRAITH

     (puzzled)
     The next inbound wave was supposed to wait for my command.

   [The tech types on the keyboard. The lead Wraith looks at the monitor.
   Sheppard's strike force team enters the station through the Stargate.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [The strike force sweeps through the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Teams Three and Four, take the lower level. Teams One and Two, with
     me, this way.

   [The strike force splits up. McKay goes with Sheppard.]

   INT--SGC GATE ROOM

   [Ronon and Teal'c enter the SGC through the Stargate, alert. They see
   the downed personnel and globe. Ronon checks one airman's vital signs
   as Teal'c approaches the globe.]

     RONON
     Yeah, they're alive. They're just stunned.

     TEAL'C
     By this device perhaps.

     RONON
     I don't know. I've never seen one of these before.

   [Teal'c looks up to the control room and sees no one there conscious.]

     TEAL'C
     It appears other personnel have been disabled as well. The question
     is how much of this base has been compromised?

     RONON
     Where the hell are the Wraith?

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard's team moves through the station. They encounter Wraith and
   engage in a firefight.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio, between shooting)
     Ronon, Teal'c, come in! Ronon, do you copy!

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The Wraith watches the firefight as teams spread through the station.]

     WRAITH
     Shut the door!

   [The technician presses some controls, and the blast door shuts.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [The Wraith shooting at Sheppard have either retreated or been killed.
   Sheppard waves his team ahead.]

     SHEPPARD
     Clear.

   [He leads them down the corridor. A monitor on the wall comes to life,
   and the head Wraith shows up on the screen.]

     WRAITH

     (on video)
     Colonel Sheppard!

     MCKAY
     Sheppard!

   [McKay and Sheppard stare at the screen.]

     WRAITH
     You have no chance of retaking this station. Therefore, it is in
     your best interest to surrender immediately.

   [Sheppard and McKay exchange puzzled looks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Do I know you?

     WRAITH
     Not personally, no. But I know a great deal about you. You as well,
     Doctor McKay.

     MCKAY
     Who are you?

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The conversation switches between the control room and corridor, where
   McKay and Sheppard appear on the control room's vid screen.]

     WRAITH
     An acquaintance of someone you recently worked with to bring about
     the demise of those you referred to as "Replicators." It was from
     him that I was able to procure the necessary data to commandeer this
     base.

     MCKAY

     (furious, to Sheppard)
     It was Todd! That bastard hacked my system!

     SHEPPARD

     So much for buddies.
     (to Wraith)
     So, what's the plan? Take over Midway, and then what? Earth?

     WRAITH
     My warriors are securing a beachhead in your command center as we
     speak.

     SHEPPARD
     Hate to break this to you, but the SGC is heavily fortified. You're
     walking into a world of hurt.

     WRAITH
     Not to worry. We have ways of evening the odds.

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Teal'c and Ronon investigate the control room, finding everyone
   unconscious and the monitors showing a lockdown. Ronon spots Wraith
   moving on a surveillance monitor.]

     RONON
     Look they're working their to the surface, tryin' to get out.

     TEAL'C

     (confidently)
     They will be unable to do so. A pulse of energy--no doubt from that
     Wraith device--has triggered the SGC automatic lockdown.

     RONON
     So, no one gets in, and no one gets out?

     TEAL'C

     (smiling)
     Indeed.

     RONON
     That's just the way I like it.

   [They move out.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The Wraith tech watches as the Pegasus Stargate activates.]

     WRAITH TECH
     We have activation.

     WRAITH

     That will be our reinforcements.
     (to Sheppard and McKay)
     Soon, it is you who will be in for "a world of hurt."

     MCKAY

     (sotto voce)
     Oh, crap.

   [Sheppard hits him.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to Wraith)
     Listen, love to sit around and chat, but...gotta go.

   [He shoots the camera with his pistol.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

     SHEPPARD

     (to Hester)
     Take positions. Anything comes through the 'gate, kill it..

     HESTER
     Yes, sir.

     SHEPPARD

     (to two strike force members)
     You two, with me.

   [He, McKay and some strike force members run down the corridor.]

     MCKAY
     Where're we going?

     SHEPPARD
     We're going to the control room, to shut down the 'gate!

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM

   [Sheppard's group gets into a firefight with the two Wraith soldiers
   guarding the door. Both guards are downed, but not before one stuns one
   of the strike force team. The door opens and other soldiers fire, but
   are gunned down by Sheppard. Another strike force team member is
   stunned. The Wraith technician goes for one of the soldier's guns, but
   is shot by Sheppard before he can reach it.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [Lee peeks out from behind a console as Sheppard sweeps the area.
   Sheppard immediately points his gun at the movement, and Lee raises his
   hands.]

     LEE
     Whoa! Oh, thank God!

   [Sheppard lowers his gun.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where's the head guy?

     LEE
     He left.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I can see that. Where'd he go?

     LEE
     Uh, I-I don't know. He just ran out.

     SHEPPARD

     (calling out)
     McKay, we're in the clear! Get to work!

   [McKay comes up from the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where's Ronon and Teal'c?

     LEE
     They went through the Milky Way Gate on the way to Stargate Command.
     They were chasing after the Wraith.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, here.

   [He hands Lee his pistol. McKay types on the console.]

     LEE
     What am I supposed to--

   [Sheppard points generally to the downed strike force members.]

     SHEPPARD
     Get those two guys inside. Seal the door. Shoot anything that tries
     to get through.

     MCKAY
     Where are you going?

     SHEPPARD
     Going to help those marines.

   [He spots Kavanaugh lying on the floor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Is he dead?

     LEE
     Fainted.

     SHEPPARD

     (sneering)
     Figures.

     MCKAY
     Well, you better wake him up. We got a problem.

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     MCKAY
     I can't shut down the Stargate.

     LEE
     I think I saw them inputting a lockout protocol just before you guys
     came in.

     MCKAY
     Damn it!

   [The monitor for the Gate room shows another wave of Wraith soldiers
   entering the station through the Stargate.]

     SHEPPARD
     We got Wraith coming through the 'gate. We're about to get overrun.

   [Sheppard runs out while McKay watches the invasion with horror.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard cautiously makes his way down the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Hester, come in, what's your twenty?

   [The radio speaker is filled with static and gunfire.]

     HESTER

     (over radio)
     We're still outside of the gate room. We got a ton of Wraith coming
     through.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Where are the other teams?

     HESTER

     (over radio)
     I lost contact with them. I don't know how much longer we can hold
     them off here, sir!

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Just hang on. McKay's trying to shut down the 'gate.

   [The speaker sounds the hail of gunfire, and Hester's team shouting and
   screaming.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Hester? Hester! Come in!

   [The reception becomes interrupted. After a final scream, all is
   silent.]

   [Sheppard turns a corner and encounters Wraith. He shoots several of
   them down before falling back. The remaining Wraith pursue him.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Ronon and Teal'c wander the corridors, noticing the unconscious
   personnel scattered everywhere. They pause by a desiccated corpse.
   Teal'c bends down to study it.]

     RONON
     He was fed on by the Wraith. It's not a good way to go.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed.

   [He takes the airman's zat.]

     RONON
     You say that a lot.

     TEAL'C
     What?

     RONON
     "Indeed."

     TEAL'C

     (concerned)
     Do I?

     RONON
     Yeah.

     TEAL'C

     (considering)
     I had not noticed.

   [They move to another corridor. As Ronon turns the corner, he sees a
   Wraith soldier feeding.]

     RONON
     Hey!

   [He shoots the Wraith soldier and rushes forward in bloodlust. Teal'c
   moves back more cautiously.]

     TEAL'C
     Ronon!

   [Two more Wraith come after Ronon from another side corridor. One pins
   Ronon against the wall, while Teal'c zats the other. More Wraith come
   up behind Teal'c and he fires at them. Another one tries to tackle
   Teal'c from the side corridor, but he spins and knocks it against the
   wall.]

   [Ronon continues to wrestle the Wraith pinning him, trying to keep his
   feeding arm away. Teal'c breaks the neck of the Wraith he fights. Ronon
   is losing his struggle against the Wraith choking him. Teal'c shoots it
   with Ronon's lost pistol, then studies the weapon in his hand while
   Ronon coughs and catches his breath. Teal'c offers the pistol back to
   Ronon, butt first.]

     TEAL'C
     I would very much like to have a weapon such as this.

   [Ronon takes the gun.]

     RONON
     Yeah, get in line.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

     SHEPPARD

     (whispering into radio)
     Rodney? Talk to me.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [Kavanaugh is now awake and watches Lee and McKay work at the consoles.
   The door is shut and the unconscious marines are inside with them.]

   [The rest of the conversation switches between here and Sheppard's
   location.]

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Still working.

     SHEPPARD

     (low, over radio)
     I've lost contact with Hester and the marines. I think they were
     killed. How long before you get the 'gate shut down?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. This is extremely complicated.

     KAVANAUGH
     Have you tried the critical systems bypass?

     MCKAY
     I have to figure out a safe work-around to avoid any commands that
     may have been compromised.

   [Sheppard runs down a corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     You better hurry up! We got more Wraith on the way.

     MCKAY

     (irked)
     I'm working as fast as I can!

     KAVANAUGH

     (to Lee)
     Why doesn't he just bypass the critical systems?

     LEE

     (dismissive)
     N-not now. Just watch the door.

   [While McKay talks through the radio, Kavanaugh purses his lips and
   walks determinedly to a wall panel, typing some commands.]

     MCKAY
     Besides, even if I could shut down the 'gate, there's Wraith in
     every sector of the base. We're completely outnumbered. I mean, it's
     just a matter of time before they wipe us all--

   [The Stargate shuts down.]

     MCKAY
     The 'gate just shut off.

   [McKay and Lee stare at their displays, surprised and worried. McKay
   turns to Kavanaugh.]

     MCKAY
     What did you do?

     KAVANAUGH
     I shut it off using the critical systems bypass.

   [McKay and Lee look at Kavanaugh in horror.]

     MCKAY
     Are you out of your mind?!

     KAVANAUGH
     What? It worked!

   [The self-destruct alarm starts to blare.]

     LEE

     (terrified)
     Oh my God. The self destruct.

     KAVANAUGH
     I didn't mean--I...I--

     MCKAY
     Did you not just hear me say I need to figure out a safe workaround
     to avoid any commands that may have been compromised? As in
     booby-trapped? Look, I didn't use the bypass to shut down the 'gate
     for this very reason!

   [Sheppard climbs down a ladder into another corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     We've made a terrible mistake! We never should've revived Kavanaugh!

     SHEPPARD

     (horrified)
     He triggered the self-destruct?

     KAVANAUGH
     Not on purpose!

     MCKAY

     (tightly)
     That doesn't really matter now, does it?

     LEE

     (checking his watch, fighting to stay calm)
     All right, we've got just under ten minutes before this whole
     station blows up.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, can you turn it off?

     MCKAY
     No. We're completely locked out. The Wraith made sure if they
     couldn't have this station, then no one could.

     LEE

     (shuddering breath)
     Oh, things couldn't get any worse.

   [They hear blasts just outside.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM

   [Wraith soldiers shoot at the door.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

     KAVANAUGH
     They're shooting at the door.

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c and Ronon search the corridor. They hear a noise in one room.
   They move to it and burst inside.]

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Ronon and Teal'c find IOA members slumped unconscious in a secondary
   conference room.]

     TEAL'C
     Wait.

   [Teal'c moves over. Coolidge has fallen out of his chair, but the
   movement has awakened him (or vice versa). He struggles to his feet.]

     TEAL'C
     Are you all right?

   [Coolidge blinks at Teal'c.]

     TEAL'C
     Ronon Dex, this is Mr. Coolidge of the IOA.

     RONON
     Oh. Hey.

     COOLIDGE
     What happened?

     TEAL'C
     You were rendered unconscious by a Wraith stun device.

     COOLIDGE
     What? There are Wraith? Here?

     TEAL'C
     They have infiltrated the base. It is best if you remain in this
     room until Ronon Dex and I have neutralized the situation.

     COOLIDGE
     No, no, no. We need to get to the control room, radio for help.

   [Ronon puts his hand out and steps in Coolidge's path.]

     RONON
     We don't need help.

     COOLIDGE
     How many Wraith are here on this base?

     TEAL'C
     We do not know exact numbers, but there are many.

     COOLIDGE
     And who else beside you are going after them?

     TEAL'C
     We are the only two.

     COOLIDGE
     Get me to a radio!

     RONON
     It's better if we--

     COOLIDGE
     Now!

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard hides in a room as soldiers storm through the corridor
   outside.]

     SHEPPARD
     I've got an idea, Rodney.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The conversation switches between the two locations.]

     MCKAY
     Great, because we've got Wraith just about to blast through the
     door.

     SHEPPARD
     This place has got a puddle jumper docked here, right?

     MCKAY
     Yeah, to be used as an emergency escape pod.

   [Sheppard reloads his rifle.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I'd say this pretty much qualifies...as an emergency.

     LEE

     (stammering)
     No, no, no, no! We'll be stuck out here in the middle of the
     galactic void!

     MCKAY
     They'll mount a rescue. It might take a couple of weeks, but the
     jumper is stocked with food and water. We should be all right,
     unless you want to stay here and get blown to smithereens with the
     rest of the station. Your call!

     KAVANAUGH
     We've got one other problem. How we going to get there?

   [Lee and McKay look stumped...and worried.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard rounds a corner, timing it right to shoot and kill several
   Wraith. He runs and finds the strike force, all dead and fed upon.]

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney, we're out of time. Vent the atmosphere.

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [The conversation switches between here and Sheppard's location.]

     MCKAY
     What?

     SHEPPARD
     Every room but the control room. Vent the air.

     MCKAY
     How close are you?

     SHEPPARD
     Don't wait for me, just do it.

     MCKAY
     Can you make it to the jumper?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know. I'll try.

   [He breaks into a run.]

   [In the control room, Lee and McKay look horrified.]

     MCKAY
     John, I'm not sure there's time to--

     SHEPPARD

     (sharply)
     We don't have time to argue! Do it!

   [The blasting continues to sound outside the door of the control room,
   becoming even more intense. Lee licks his lips nervously and taps
   Rodney on the shoulder in encouragement.]

     MCKAY
     Venting the atmosphere.

   [He types controls to vent the oxygen.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDORS

   [The air is sucked out of the station. The Wraith soldiers struggle,
   but quickly lose their breath and fall. In one corridor, Sheppard
   struggles from the wind caused by the air being blown out, trying to
   reach the jumper. He is tackled by the head Wraith. They struggle;
   Sheppard is able shoot the Wraith with his pistol. Sheppard moves only
   a small way across the floor before running out of breath and stopping,
   face down.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28

   [Ronon and Teal'c shoot several Wraith trying to open the elevator
   doors to the shaft. Coolidge follows, keeping his head ducked from
   bullet casings. He ducks for cover as the firefight ensues, finally
   running away. Finally all the Wraith are downed by Ronon and Teal'c.]

     RONON

     (gesturing two directions from the corridor)
     I'll go this way, you go that way.

     TEAL'C
     Where is Mr. Coolidge?

     RONON

     (glancing around)
     I don't know.

   [They split up.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM

   [Kavanaugh listens at the door. The self-destruct continues to count
   down. Lee looks at the surveillance monitors.]

     KAVANAUGH
     It's pretty quiet out there.

     LEE

     (looking at the security camera display)
     Looks like they're all dead.

     MCKAY

     (into radio)
     Sheppard, can you hear me?...John, are you there?

   [The two stunned marines finally awaken. Kavanaugh helps them to their
   feet. McKay keeps listening for Sheppard to respond.]

     LEE

     (quietly)
     It should be enough time. I think it's safe to
     re-pressurize...Doctor McKay?

     MCKAY

     (shakily)
     Yeah...re-pressurizing the station.

   [He types some controls, his face a mask of grief.]

   INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM

   [Ronon runs in. He finds Coolidge standing by a control panel.]

     RONON
     What are you doing?

     COOLIDGE
     I've contacted the military. They're fully aware of the situation,
     which means, unfortunately, they're preparing to nuke the base.

     RONON
     What?!

   [Some of the control room personnel are beginning to awaken; they get
   up groggily.]

     COOLIDGE
     Stargate Command has been compromised! The only way to fully prevent
     the Wraith from infiltrating the general population is to destroy
     it.

     RONON

     (fiercely)
     Well, tell them to call it off.

     COOLIDGE
     I can't do that. Not as long as there's a single Wraith is still
     alive on this base!

     HARRIMAN
     Wraith?! What, here?

     RONON
     Listen, we'll deal with the Wraith. Look, you've still got people
     alive here. Buy us some more time!

     COOLIDGE
     We don't have time. Look, there's an escape hatch to the surface. We
     need to get to it immediately. Where's Teal'c?

   [Ronon glances at the security monitors. Teal'c is trapped in a
   corridor, Wraith shooting at him from both sides.]

     RONON
     He's surrounded. I need to get back to him.

     COOLIDGE
     No. No time! We have to leave as soon as we can!

     RONON
     Not without Teal'c.

     COOLIDGE
     We can't go back for him! We could get bogged down or killed!

   [Ronon leaves. Coolidge follows calling after him.]

     COOLIDGE
     Now, there's a clear path to the escape hatch, and we need to get
     out of here, now!

     RONON

     (spinning, furious)
     You want to run away and save yourself? Fine! I'm staying here.

   [He takes off.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR

   [McKay, Kavanaugh, Lee and the two marines climb down a ladder to the
   corridor near the jumper.]

     MCKAY
     The jumper bay is...

     LEE
     Through the EVA prep room. And it's not a real bay though. It's more
     like an airlock that leads to a hatch that's cut into the top--

     MCKAY

     (impatient)
     I don't need the blueprints! Where is it?

   [Kavanaugh points. Lee points too, with his pistol.]

     LEE
     It's over there...

     MCKAY
     Just...

   [McKay lowers Lee's gun arm and cuts ahead, anxious to look for
   Sheppard.]

   INT--MIDWAY STATION EVA PREP ROOM

   [The door to the room opens. McKay motions for Lee to come forward. He
   moves to a large hatchway door.]

     LEE
     Through here.

   [Lee enters the combination to the airlock on the electronic keypad.
   Kavanaugh pushes Lee aside to be the first one through. Resigned, Lee
   follows, followed by the two marines. McKay is the last to go, but
   pauses upon hearing one of the EVA suit's regulators hissing. He
   approaches and turns on the active suit's helmet light. Sheppard is
   semi-conscious inside.]

     MCKAY

     (shocked)
     Sheppard?! How the hell did you--?

     SHEPPARD

     (weakly)
     Get me out of here.

     MCKAY
     Yeah.

   [McKay starts to unlock his helmet.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c guns down two Wraith, turns and shoots a third, trying to move
   through. He guns down another Wraith, then pauses, sensing for the next
   attack. A Wraith comes out of one of the closed doors and tackles him
   from the side. Ronon shoots two other Wraith trying to ambush Teal'c,
   but gets distracted by a Wraith behind him.]

   [Teal'c and Ronon both deal hand-to-hand with individual Wraith. Teal'c
   is caught off-guard by his enemy and thrown across the hallway into the
   section wall. He collapses. Ronon is able to get away from his guard
   and grabs a section of pipe from the ceiling. Wielding it like a bantos
   stick, he clubs the Wraith.]

   [The Wraith soldier pins Teal'c against the wall and feeds on him for a
   moment. He screams in pain. The Wraith is impaled by Ronon's broken
   section of pipe. He falls to the floor dead as Ronon stands behind him.
   Teal'c catches his breath and wipes his bloody lip.]

     TEAL'C

     (weakly)
     Excellent timing.

     RONON
     Indeed.

   [Teal'c nods in gratitude and slowly moves forward. Ronon claps him on
   the back.]

     RONON
     Well, I think that's all of them.

   [Teal'c looks around.]

     TEAL'C

     (hoarsely)
     I certainly hope you are correct.

     RONON
     We got to call the military. They're going to blow this place up.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Lee looks worriedly at the ceiling airlock.]

     LEE
     What's taking him so long?

     KAVANAUGH

     (checking watch)
     The self-destruct's about to blow! Twenty seconds!

   [McKay drops into the jumper, followed immediately by Sheppard.]

     KAVANAUGH
     Colonel Sheppard! How did you...?

     SHEPPARD

     (impatient)
     Later! We're leaving. Sit down!

   [Sheppard joins McKay in the cockpit.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The jumper powers up and flies away seconds before the station
   explodes.]

   EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY

   INT--SGC CONFERENCE ROOM

   [The IOA committee sit together at one side of the table. Ronon sits
   facing them.]

     COOLIDGE
     Ronon Dex...do you feel that you can fulfill the duties of an SG
     team member with diligence, integrity, and respect for those in
     authority over you?

   [Ronon slowly leans close to the microphone in front of him.]

     RONON
     Yes.

   [Ronon leans back. Coolidge looks to his fellow committee members.]

     COOLIDGE

     (smiling)
     Good enough for me.

   [Ronon looks at them, surprised, then turns in his chair.]

   INT--SGC CORRIDOR

   [Teal'c waits outside the door for Ronon to exit. Ronon opens the door
   and walks out, closing the door behind them.]

     TEAL'C
     Well?

     RONON
     I'm exactly the kind of team member they want out there fighting the
     Wraith. Their words, not mine.

     TEAL'C
     And you did not hold a weapon to their heads?

     RONON
     I did not.

     TEAL'C

     (smiling)
     I am pleased.

     RONON

     (smiling, shrugging)
     Yeah, well, I had a good coach.

     TEAL'C
     Indeed. The Daedalus is preparing to leave. Colonel Caldwell will
     beam you aboard when you are ready.

     RONON

     (concerned)
     Still nothing from Midway?

     TEAL'C
     No. We have lost all contact with them. The Daedalus will stop on
     its way back to Atlantis to assess the situation.

   [As they walk, Ronon appears worried.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The puddle jumper floats in the void between the Milky Way Galaxy and
   Pegasus Galaxy.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Kavanaugh and Lee hold playing cards and sit on the floor of the
   jumper. The marines sit on the benches and McKay sits on the floor--the
   trio look bored.]

     LEE
     No way. You actually liked it?

     KAVANAUGH
     It's his finest film.

     LEE
     Pearl Harbor?

   [Lee turns to the others for support, looking incredulous.]

     KAVANAUGH
     Yeah, go ahead and mock it, everybody does. But that film will
     endure. It's got weight.

     LEE
     Yeah, which is why it plummeted at the box office!

     KAVANAUGH
     Two hundred million dollars domestic? That's not plummeting, I beg
     to differ.

     MCKAY

     (fuming, talking over Kavanaugh)
     Enough already! We've been stuck here for god knows how long, and
     you haven't shut up, either of you! You just keep talking and
     tal-tal-talk-talk-talk-talk!

   [McKay natters into silence, his arms expressing his frustration. There
   is a loud metallic clank outside.]

     MCKAY
     What was that?

     LEE
     Something just hit us.

   [The door starts to open and they struggle to their feet.]

     KAVANAUGH
     Oh!

   [Ronon stands outside in the Daedalus hangar bay with two Daedalus crew
   members.]

     MCKAY
     Ronon!

     LEE
     Wha-where are we?

     RONON
     Daedalus, 302 bay. We saw you, scooped you up. We're heading back to
     Atlantis.

     KAVANAUGH
     Thank God.

   [He goes to hug Ronon, but Ronon pushes him against the jumper
   bulkhead. Lee slaps Ronon on the back. Ronon walks up to McKay as the
   marines leave.]

     MCKAY

     (sadly)
     Midway was destroyed.

     RONON
     Yeah, we saw. Where's Sheppard?

   [McKay opens the door to the pilot cabin. Sheppard lounges asleep in
   the pilot chair, facing the rear compartment with headphones over his
   ears.]

     MCKAY
     Lasted about a day, sealed himself in there.

   [McKay rolls his eyes and leaves.]

     RONON
     No wonder he didn't hear the radio call.

   [Ronon approaches Sheppard and taps him on the cheek. Sheppard, still
   asleep, bats Ronon's hand away. Ronon smiles and tweaks Sheppard's
   nose. Sheppard bats him again. Fighting laughter, Ronon tries again.
   Sheppard starts awake.]

     SHEPPARD
     Mwhah!

   [Ronon laughs.]

     SHEPPARD

     Thank God!
     (pointing to rear compartment)
     I almost shot myself with a stunner.

     RONON
     Yeah. I understand.

   [Sheppard groans, taking off his headphones and looking out the
   window.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where are we?

     RONON
     Daedalus 302 bay.

     SHEPPARD
     What's the status of SGC?

     RONON
     Secure. Teal'c and I took care of the Wraith.

     SHEPPARD
     I figured you would.

     RONON

     (beckoning)
     Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah.

   [Ronon starts walking out. Sheppard follows, picking up his vest as he
   leaves.]

     RONON
     Oh, and I, uh, passed my interview with the IOA.

     SHEPPARD
     Really?

     RONON
     Yeah. They said they liked me.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, what's not to like?

   EXT--SPACE

   [Daedalus enters hyperspace, heading to the Pegasus Galaxy.]

   FADE OUT
