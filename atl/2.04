   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY

   [Several Marines are guarding the Stargate, which stands in the open on
   a grassy hillside. There is smoke rising from the trees in the
   background and evidence of burnt buildings in front of the gate.]

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard and two marines are making their way through the forest.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. I'm about ready to call this one. Doesn't look like there
     are any survivors.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [In another part of the forest, Teyla, Lorne and a Marine are walking
   past the remains of a settlement.]

     TEYLA
     The cullings are getting more and more intense.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     You said it yourself...

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard and two marines are making their way through the forest.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Too many Wraith woke up at the same time. Too many mouths to feed,
     or hands to feed.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [In another part of the forest, Teyla, Lorne and a Marine are walking
   past the remains of a settlement.]

     LORNE
     We're heading back to the 'gate. Meet you there?

   EXT--OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY

   [McKay, Beckett and Cadman are walking across the field.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Sounds like a plan. McKay, Beckett, you having any luck?

     BECKETT
     Negative, Colonel. We haven't found anyone.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Make your way back to the 'gate.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard and two marines are making their way through the forest.]

     BECKETT

     (over radio)
     Will do. Beckett out.

   EXT--OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY

   [McKay, Beckett and Cadman are walking across the field.]

     CADMAN
     So, maybe you should pick some wild flowers from around here. I
     think she'd get a kick out of that.

     MCKAY
     What are you talking about?

     CADMAN
     You've got a date tomorrow night with Katie Brown, right? She's a
     botanist. She never gets to go off-world.

     BECKETT
     What's this now?

     MCKAY
     It's nothing. Nothing.

     BECKETT

     (snickering)
     You have a date, Rodney? With a woman?

     MCKAY

     (testily)
     It is simply two adults sharing some friendly... Yes, with a woman!

     CADMAN
     Well, she's excited about it. I'm not sure why, though.

     MCKAY
     How would you know?

     CADMAN
     Girls' poker night. I know a lot of things, McKay.

     MCKAY
     And I'm sure it is none of your business. This is inappropriate
     field conversation.

     CADMAN
     What? I was just suggesting you might want to pick flowers.

   [A buzzing can be heard in the distance.]

     MCKAY
     Yes, and maybe you should just do your job, which is to protect
     us...

     CADMAN
     Shut up.

   [The buzzing getting louder.]

     MCKAY
     Shut up? Let me tell you something...

     CADMAN
     Hey, stop speaking!

   [They stop and listen.]

     CADMAN
     Dart.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard stops to listen to Cadman's report.]

     CADMAN

     (over radio)
     We have a Dart incoming.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [In another part of the forest, Teyla, Lorne and the Marine break into
   a run

   EXT--OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY

   [Cadman signals to Beckett and McKay.]

     CADMAN
     Move it!

   [The three break into a run.]

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Sheppard signals to the Marines to run.]

     SHEPPARD
     If it's seen us, it'll blow Atlantis' cover.

   EXT--FOREST ON PLANET, DAY

   [Teyla and Lorne are running through the forest.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     Anyone get a clear shot, you take it. Understand?

   EXT--OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY

   [Cadman, Beckett and McKay are running across the open space together.
   The Dart is in the sky behind them, heading in the same direction.
   Cadman pushes Beckett out of the way and he falls to the ground.]

     CADMAN
     Scatter!

   [As Beckett lies on the ground, McKay and Cadman continue running. The
   Dart activates its beam and both of them are caught and disappear.
   Beckett watches the Dart fly away.]

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY

   [The Stargate activates, the Marines are on alert and Sheppard takes up
   a position directly in front of the open wormhole.]

   EXT--CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY

   [Teyla, Lorne and the other Marine enter the clearing. As the Dart
   flies overhead, Teyla and the Marine fire their P-90s at it. Lorne
   fires the rocket launcher he has been carrying on his shoulder, but the
   shot hits a tree.]

     TEYLA

     (into radio)
     It is heading towards the gate.

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY

   [A Marine is pacing in front of the Stargate.]

     TEYLA

     (over radio)
     We damaged it, but it is still on its way.

   [Beckett comes running across the clearing.]

     BECKETT
     Wait! McKay and Cadman have been beamed aboard that Dart.

     SHEPPARD
     We can't risk the Dart making it back to the Hive ship.

   [The Dart flies directly towards the Stargate and Sheppard and the
   Marines open fire. Smoke pours from one of the Dart's engines as it
   careens towards the hillside and Beckett.]

     BECKETT
     Oh, God.

   [Narrowly missing Beckett who throws himself to the ground, the Dart
   crashes on the hilltop. Sheppard and the Marines run towards the crash
   site. Beckett lifts himself from the dirt and surveys the burning
   wreckage in front of him.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   EXT--STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY

   [As Beckett approaches the smoking wreckage of the crashed Dart, the
   cockpit opens. Beckett raises his sidearm and walks slowly towards the
   ship. The Wraith at the controls is badly injured. As Beckett and the
   Wraith exchange looks, Beckett lowers his gun and raises his other hand
   in a gesture of conciliation.]

     BECKETT
     I'm a doctor. I can help.

   [The Wraith reaches towards the control panel of the Dart. As it does
   so, it is hit by a barrage of gunfire. Sheppard and the Marines have
   arrived on the scene.]

     BECKETT
     What the hell do you think you're doing?

     SHEPPARD
     He was reaching for the self-destruct.

     BECKETT
     He's the only one that could get Cadman and McKay out!

     SHEPPARD
     I seriously doubt he'd oblige.

   [Teyla, Lorne and the Marine arrive at the scene.]

     BECKETT
     Well, we'll never know now, will we?

     TEYLA
     Is everyone all right?

     SHEPPARD
     We're fine. Hansen, radio Atlantis. I want Zelenka here ASAP. We've
     got a problem.

   [Later. The crash site is ringed by Marines as a group of scientists
   work on the Dart.]

     BECKETT
     Colonel!

   [Sheppard approaches where Beckett and Zelenka are working at the back
   of the Dart. They have a laptop computer wired into the wreckage.
   Sparks suddenly start flying as Zelenka performs an operation on the
   computer and he jumps in fright.]

     SHEPPARD
     First time off-world?

     ZELENKA

     (nervously)
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, if there were any more Wraith, they would have attacked us by
     now.

     ZELENKA
     Really?

     SHEPPARD
     If it makes you feel better. Did you find what we want?

     ZELENKA
     Uh, well, yes, but it's very complex. This interface controls the
     machine that dematerializes people, stores their information, and
     then rematerializes them again when commanded to.

     SHEPPARD
     Great. Command it to.

     ZELENKA
     Uh, I can't.

     BECKETT
     From what we can tell the materializer is storing two life-signs.

     ZELENKA
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD
     Which is good.

     ZELENKA
     Yes, but there is only enough power in the Dart's energy cell to
     successfully re-materialize one of them.

   [The computer screen shows two white blips.]

     ZELENKA
     Power to the re-materializer has been completely severed, and
     emergency backup power is completely run down.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay.

     ZELENKA
     You have to decide which one we are going to beam out.

     BECKETT
     It's a terrible choice to have to make.

     SHEPPARD
     It's easy. Beam out McKay. He'll figure it out how to get Cadman
     free.

     ZELENKA
     No. No, sorry. I was unclear.

     BECKETT
     There's no way of telling which is which.

     ZELENKA
     Yes. They just read as life-signs.

     SHEPPARD
     Perfect.

   [Sheppard regards the screen for a moment then points.]

     SHEPPARD

     All right, that one. Go.
     (to the people standing nearby)
     Stand aside.

   [Everyone stands back from the rear of the Dart. As Zelenka performs an
   operation on the computer, the re-materialization beam activates and
   McKay appears.]

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney, you okay?

     MCKAY
     Mm.

   [McKay faints and Beckett rushes to him.]

     BECKETT
     His pulse is stable but I need to get him back to Atlantis.

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla and Lorne, help the doc get back to the city with McKay. I'll
     stay here with Zelenka and try and bring as much of the Dart back as
     possible.

   [Teyla, Beckett and Lorne struggle to lift McKay.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [McKay is still unconscious, now lying in a hospital bed under a
   scanner with electrodes attached to his head.</blockquote>

     BECKETT
     All of his vitals are stable. His body's reacting like he's been
     struck by a Wraith stunner.

     WEIR
     So you think once the initial shock is over, we'll have the old
     McKay back?

     BECKETT
     I'm afraid so.

   [Beckett and Weir smile.]

     BECKETT
     Have they had any luck with the wreckage?

     WEIR
     No. Lieutenant Cadman is still in there somewhere. Did you know her
     well?

     BECKETT
     No, not really. She's with the new batch that came aboard the
     Daedalus. She seemed quite lovely, though. She saved my life.

     WEIR
     Well, you'll be the first person I call when we find her.

     BECKETT
     Thank you.

   [Weir leaves the infirmary.]

   INT--ATLANTIS HANGAR

   [A scientist is removing the materializer interface from the remains of
   the Dart. Several other scientists work on various things around the
   hangar.]

     SCIENTIST

     Ugh!
     (mutters in German).

     SHEPPARD
     How's it coming?

     ZELENKA
     Well, the good news is we were able to stabilize her life-sign
     signature. Now it's just a question of getting the machine on-line
     again.

     SHEPPARD
     Great. How do we power it up?

     ZELENKA

     Well, that's the bad news. The machine uses a very specialized
     transformer to convert raw power into highly stable, very specific
     stream of power. Now, the transformer's crucial in operating the
     machine safely, and, uh, it's been
     damaged.

   [Zelenka shows Sheppard a container holding several pieces of twisted,
   charred metal.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't suppose there are any spares in the trunk?

     ZELENKA
     We're working on reverse-engineering one.

     SHEPPARD
     Good. Let me know the second you have something.

     ZELENKA
     (gives instruction to the other scientists in Czech)

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS

   [Ronon is eating a large plate of food with his fingers. Sheppard
   enters the mess and sits at the table opposite him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Not bad, huh?

     RONON
     It's fine.

     SHEPPARD
     So, what do you think of Atlantis?

     RONON
     It's fine.

     SHEPPARD
     Have you thought about what you want to do after you're done here?

     RONON
     Do you want me to leave?

     SHEPPARD
     No, no. Stay as long as you like. I'm just saying, uh, you know your
     way around. You can take care of yourself in a fight. You hate the
     Wraith as much as we do.

   [Ronon looks at him pointedly.]

     SHEPPARD

     Okay, maybe more than we do. The point is, we could use a guy like
     you around here and you look like you could use a place to
     stay.

   [Ronon casts a look over his shoulder at the Marine guarding him.]

     RONON
     I'm not sure I fit in here.

     SHEPPARD
     There's only one way to find out.

     RONON
     Do I have to decide now, or can I finish eating?

     SHEPPARD

     Take your time. And, uh...
     (offering a knife and fork)
     ...try these. They work great.

   [Ronon takes the cutlery from Sheppard and resumes eating.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [McKay wakes with a groan. Beckett, who has been tending to another
   patient, comes to his bedside.]

     MCKAY
     Hello. Oh...

     BECKETT
     How are you feeling, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Um... terrible. What happened?

     BECKETT
     You were scooped up by a Dart.

     BECKETT
     Oh, great. How'd I get out?

     MCKAY
     It's a long story, but I'm glad to see you're doing well.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Hello? Dr. Beckett?

     MCKAY
     Is that Cadman?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Dr. McKay?

   [McKay looks around the infirmary.]

     MCKAY
     Where is she?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I'm right here.

     BECKETT
     Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped in the Dart.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     What?

     MCKAY
     Who said that?

     BECKETT
     I did.

     MCKAY
     You said "what?"

     BECKETT
     I said Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.

     MCKAY
     No, no, no. Did you just say the word "what?"

     BECKETT
     No, I didn't.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     McKay?

     MCKAY
     Yes. Where are you?

     BECKETT
     I'm right here.

     MCKAY
     No, no, I'm talking to Cadman. Shut up for a second.

     BECKETT
     She's not here, Rodney.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Yes, I am.

     MCKAY
     You didn't just hear that? You didn't just hear Lieutenant Cadman?

     BECKETT
     No, I didn't.

     MCKAY

     Head set!
     (checks his ears)
     Not wearing a head set.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     McKay, where are you?

     MCKAY
     I'm right in front of Carson.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Oh, no. Put your hands over your eyes.

     MCKAY
     Why?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Just do it!

     BECKETT
     Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart, and I think
     maybe you're experiencing some sort of...

   [McKay puts his hands over his eyes.]

     BECKETT
     Rodney, what are you doing?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Oh, this is terrible.

     MCKAY
     What's terrible?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I can see that. I can see your hands over your eyes as if they were
     my eyes.

   [McKay uncovers his eyes.]

     MCKAY
     Carson. Hi.

     BECKETT
     Hello.

     MCKAY
     Who got us out of the Dart?

     BECKETT
     Zelenka. But he only got you out. Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped
     inside the Dart.

     MCKAY

     (shaking his head)
     No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     This cannot be happening.

     MCKAY
     Cadman's not trapped in the Dart.

     BECKETT
     Excuse me?

     MCKAY

     (pointing at his head)
     She's in here.

   INT--ATLANTIS HANGAR

   [McKay takes a piece of metal from the box holding the remains of the
   power transformer. Sheppard, Weir and Beckett are looking on.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, nice work.

     ZELENKA
     We were running out of power. I knew hardly anything about the
     machine. Who would have thought this could be one of the side
     effects?

     MCKAY
     So instead of waiting to understand what it was that you were doing
     you just sort of mashed on the keyboard, hoping something would
     happen?

     ZELENKA
     You're alive, aren't you?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Ask him if he knows how to fix it.

     MCKAY
     He doesn't know how to fix it.

     ZELENKA
     What?

     MCKAY

     (pointing at his head)
     Talking to her.

     WEIR
     So you can hear her thoughts?

     MCKAY
     No, no, not her thoughts, thank God. I can hear when she's speaking,
     or when, I suppose, she's trying to speak.

     WEIR
     Are you sure he should have been discharged from the infirmary
     Carson?

     BECKETT
     According to the MRI, he's as healthy as he ever was.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     It doesn't feel very healthy in here.

     MCKAY

     Well, we can't all be track stars, now, can we?
     (to the others present)
     It was her again.

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe there's something wrong an MRI wouldn't pick up, if you know
     what I mean.

     MCKAY
     I'm not crazy. I just have another consciousness in my brain.

     SHEPPARD
     So he just looks crazy?

     MCKAY
     I'm sure I do, but only because Dr. Fumbles McStupid over here was
     in way over his head.

     ZELENKA
     Yes. Yes! I made a mistake trying to save your life! Now, do you
     want to try to fix it or do you want to continue to berate me some
     more?

     MCKAY
     I am perfectly capable of doing both at the same time. Now, I assume
     you've tried to run one of our own generators...

     ZELENKA
     It's not as simple as that.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Why not?

     ZELENKA
     The trick is having it interface with the Wraith machine in real
     time. The power fluctuations are, are huge. If we overshoot just a
     little...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Wait. What does that mean?

     ZELENKA
     ...we're screwed up.

     MCKAY
     Okay, okay. I'm sure if maybe we can write an interface program that
     can take care of all...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Hello? Rodney? Will you please answer me?

     MCKAY
     Here's what I want us to try.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     We'll take a, um...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     A naquadah generator...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Rodney!

     MCKAY
     And, um...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Rodney!

     MCKAY
     And, uh...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Rodney!

     MCKAY

     (shouting)
     Yes! What?

   [Everyone looks at McKay in surprise.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Stop ignoring me.

     MCKAY

     (frustrated)
     Well, stop asking stupid questions.

     BECKETT
     Rodney?

     MCKAY
     I will get you out of here, okay? But just be a good little girlie
     and keep quiet.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Don't you dare condescend me. This is as much my problem as it is
     yours.

     MCKAY
     And do you have a degree in physics? Hmm? Well, what about
     mechanical engineering?

     WEIR
     Rodney?

     MCKAY

     (snaps)
     Yes?
     (calming down)
     Sorry. I'm sorry. What? Please?

     WEIR
     Why don't we let Zelenka handle this?

     MCKAY
     I, I'm fine.

     SHEPPARD
     No, you're not.

     WEIR
     And I'd like you to talk to Dr. Heightmeyer.

     MCKAY
     I think it would be more useful if I was to...

     WEIR
     Rodney. I'm not asking you.

   [McKay looks around the room at everyone staring at him.]

     MCKAY
     Fine.

   [McKay leaves the hangar.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [McKay is walking along, appearing to talk to himself.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Oh, stop sulking. You're acting like a two-year-old.

     MCKAY
     This is your fault, you know.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     How do you figure that?

     MCKAY
     All you had to do was keep your mouth shut while I was working.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     You have no idea what it's like in here, okay?

   [Katie Brown steps into the corridor behind McKay. McKay stops walking
   and she watches him seemingly talking to himself.]

     MCKAY
     Yes. Yes, I do. I know exactly what it's like in here because I live
     in here. I like it here.

     KATIE
     Rodney?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Be cool.

     MCKAY
     Katie? Hi.

     KATIE
     Is everything okay?

     MCKAY
     Yes. Yes, everything is just fine. I was just, uh...

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Talking on the radio. Talking on the radio!

     MCKAY
     Talking on the radio. You're well, I take it?

     KATIE
     I, uh, heard you ran into some trouble off-world today?

     MCKAY
     Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, but everything's fine now. It's all been
     sorted out. Back to normal.

     KATIE
     Good. So we're still on for tomorrow?

     MCKAY
     Yes, yes. Yes, I tell you, I'm very much looking forward to it. In
     fact, I'm sure it'll be a, you know, a wonderful...evening, and
     whatnot.

     KATIE
     Right. Well, I'll see you then.

   [Katie walks away, turning back to give McKay a confused glance.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     You really know nothing about women, do you?

     MCKAY
     I know plenty.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Maybe this is a good thing.

     MCKAY
     Excuse me?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I could teach you a thing or two about the opposite sex, McKay. Lord
     knows you need it.

     MCKAY
     This is hell. This is my own personal hell.

   [McKay strides off down the corridor.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GYM

   [Sheppard looks on while Ronon is sparring with four Marines, punching
   them and throwing them to the mat on the floor.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Let's try that again.

   [One of the Marines looks up at Sheppard from the mat.]

     MARINE
     How about you try that again... Sir?

     SHEPPARD
     Maybe that's enough for today.

   INT--ATLANTIS, HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

   [Rodney is sitting opposite Heightmeyer on a sofa.]

     MCKAY
     And how do you feel you're qualified to help us with this problem,
     huh?

     HEIGHTMEYER
     I'm not. Who could be? This was not covered in medical school. But I
     have spent quite some time as a couples therapist.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Ha. We're not a couple.

     MCKAY
     In any sense of the definition, not a couple.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     No.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     In physics, a couple is defined as a pair of forces equal in
     magnitude, acting in opposite directions.

   [McKay rolls his eyes.]

     HEIGHTMEYER
     So you don't feel that applies here?

     MCKAY
     That's very clever, but we're not equal forces.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Watch it.

     MCKAY
     And what I mean by that is that she's just a voice in my head. I
     have control of the body.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I've seen your body, McKay. You can keep it.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     How do you know that? She been able to access the part of your brain
     that creates speech and controls hearing. Why not movement?

     MCKAY
     Well, if she could've, she would have by now.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Maybe you need to release control.

     MCKAY
     Why would I do that?

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Because, like it or not, you're sharing that body. The roles could
     have easily been reversed, Rodney. You could be trapped inside her
     body and wouldn't you like a chance to, say, talk to others without
     having to go through her?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Yeah!

     MCKAY
     Maybe.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Maybe?

     MCKAY
     Okay, yes! I would want that.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     So let her.

     MCKAY
     Oh.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Close your eyes. Take deep breaths and stop trying to control
     everything for a second.

   [McKay closes his eyes.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Hello? Hello?

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Laura?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Oh, this is weird, hearing his voice when I speak.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Can you move?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     I don't know. Let me try.

   [McKay lifts his hand and wiggles his fingers, then suddenly snaps his
   eyes open.]

     MCKAY
     Okay. That's enough of that.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Oh, come on.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Dr. McKay, we were just starting to make progress.

     MCKAY
     Well, progress won't be necessary if we can get her out of here.
     Now, I've calmed down. So has she. Now let me get back to work.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Okay.

     MCKAY
     Really? Oh, she's fine with this, by the way.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Sort of.

     MCKAY
     So, yeah. Should I...

   [McKay gets up and hurries from the room.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ARMORY

   [Sheppard is showing Ronon a variety of weapons.]

     SHEPPARD
     This is a P-90. It's a compact, lightweight, incredibly sturdy,
     fully...

   [Ronon picks up a P-90 and fires a barrage at a paper target, all of
   them hitting their mark.]

     SHEPPARD
     Good. That's... ahem, good. All right, uh... This is a nine
     millimeter, semiautomatic...

   [Ronon picks up a nine millimeter and fires off eight shots at a
   target, again all of them hitting their mark.]

     SHEPPARD

     (smiling)
     That's good, too.

     RONON
     I prefer this.

   [Ronon pulls out his blast weapon and fires a hole through the center
   of the target.]

     SHEPPARD
     I can see why you would.

   INT--ATLANTIS HANGAR

   [McKay and Zelenka are looking intently at a computer screen and
   technicians work on the Dart wreckage and at terminals around them.]

     MCKAY

     All right. Let's give this bad boy a try.
     (to the German scientist)
     Start her up, but slowly ease her into it.

     ZELENKA
     No, no, no, no. It's not ready. Some of these calculations are not
     right.

     MCKAY
     Maybe you just don't understand them.

   [A small explosion in the Dart wreckage sprays sparks and leaves a
   plume of smoke in the room. The scientist starts speaking in German in
   the background as she gets things under control.]

     MCKAY
     What the hell happened?!

     SCIENTIST
     We started it up.

     MCKAY

     (furious)
     I said, "Slowly ease her into it!"

     SCIENTIST
     I was at three percent.

     ZELENKA
     The power requirements are delicate. We should have run more
     simulations before we...

     MCKAY
     Yes, yes! Twenty-twenty hindsight.

     ZELENKA
     You shouldn't be here.

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry?

     ZELENKA

     (firmly)
     I'm telling you, these calculations are wrong. Having two
     consciousnesses inside of a single brain must be very taxing.

     MCKAY
     Listen...

     ZELENKA
     You're making mistakes.

   [Zelenka holds up a tablet screen and shows it to McKay.]

     ZELENKA
     Now, leave it to me before you do more harm than good.

   [McKay walks away.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [McKay is walking along the corridor, rubbing his eyes tiredly.
   Sheppard comes up behind him.]

     SHEPPARD
     You're up late.

     MCKAY
     Mm. I, uh... couldn't sleep I was trying to clear my head.

     SHEPPARD
     I hear the transformer test didn't go so well.

     MCKAY
     Well, you heard right.

     SHEPPARD
     Uh, listen, I wanted you to know that I gave the command to take the
     Dart down.

     MCKAY
     Look, as much as I'd like to pretend that this is remotely your
     fault, the thought of what would've happened if you hadn't shot the
     Dart down is, uh...

     SHEPPARD
     So... We're cool?

     MCKAY
     No, you're cool. I'm fine.

     SHEPPARD
     You should get some sleep.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I could actually use some rest, Rodney.

     MCKAY

     (pointing at his head)
     She says she's tired.

     SHEPPARD
     Good night.

   [Sheppard walks away.]

   INT--ATLANTIS, MCKAY'S QUARTERS

   [The door slides open and McKay enters, drops his headset on the table,
   and lies down on the bed. He appears to fall asleep, but then opens his
   eyes. He gets up, checks his body, then partially opens the zipper on
   his top.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Beckett is sitting at a computer, drinking a cup of something while he
   works. McKay enters and stands in front of Beckett, one hand on his
   hip.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Busy?

     BECKETT
     No, no. Come in. How are you feeling?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     (grinning)
     Fine.

     BECKETT
     Really?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Mm. Mainly because of Cadman. She's calming, you know? Between you
     and me, I am damn lucky it was her.

     BECKETT
     Should you, uh...

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Oh, she's asleep, can't hear a thing.

     BECKETT
     Oh, well, yes, then. She seems like a lovely lady.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     (patting Beckett's hand)
     Oh, that is so nice.

   [Beckett looks uncomfortably at McKay's hand on his.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     (pulling his hand away)
     Ahem. Hey, um... You want to, uh, do me a favor? You know, you want
     to ride shotgun on this date tomorrow night?

     BECKETT
     With Dr. Brown?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Katie.

     BECKETT
     You're going through with it?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Well, I've canceled on her so many times. I don't want to mess this
     up.

     BECKETT

     (confused)
     But what do you want me to do?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Listen, I don't think it's any big secret that I am terrible with
     women. Having someone there to cut me off when I start making a fool
     of myself would be a great help. I'd consider it a personal favor.

     BECKETT
     Okay, Rodney. Fine.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Great.

   [McKay slaps Beckett on the chest and turns to walk out. He stops and
   waves back.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     And thanks.

   [Beckett looks mystified when McKay leaves.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS, CADMAN'S QUARTERS

   [McKay wakes up, disoriented because he is clearly not in his own
   quarters.]

     MCKAY
     Where am I?

   [He glances around and notices that he is naked under a sheet.]

     MCKAY
     Where are my clothes?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Uhh... can't we sleep just a little longer?

     MCKAY

     (grabbing his watch)
     It is 2:00 in the afternoon. Where the hell are we?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     We're in my room. Your mattress sucks.

     MCKAY
     That is a prescription mattress. I need that for my back. Now, how
     the hell did we get here?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I walked here, while you were sleeping.

     MCKAY
     You did what?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Yeah, it was a lot easier to use your body when you were asleep.

     MCKAY
     Pants. Where are my pants?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     They're over on the chair.

   [McKay goes to get out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Seen it.

     MCKAY
     We have got to set some boundaries.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Yeah. I'm sorry about that. I'm kind of used to sleeping in the
     buff.

     MCKAY
     Okay, you've crossed a line here, Cadman.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I guarantee it was more traumatic for me.

   [McKay struggles to stand, wincing in pain.]

     MCKAY
     Why are my legs burning?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Oh, I sorta took us for a run before we went to bed.

     MCKAY
     Oh, why in the world would you do that?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Because it helps me unwind.

     MCKAY
     Okay, okay, this is very important. Did you ingest any citrus? I, I
     am, I'm deathly allergic to citrus.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Uh-oh.

     MCKAY
     "Uh-oh?"

     CADMAN

     (snickering)
     Rodney, look, I worked out, I came here, and I went to bed. Jeez,
     loosen up.

     MCKAY
     I would love to, but every muscle in my body is sore from your
     stupid workout.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     So, uh, what's on the board for today?

     MCKAY
     More of the same. Why? You have any ideas?

     CADMAN
     Yeah, actually, I do.

   [McKay fumbles with his underwear behind the sheet.]

     MCKAY
     Don't look.

   INT--ATLANTIS GYM

   [Teyla and Ronon are sparring with Bantos rods. The door opens and
   Sheppard enters.]

     SHEPPARD
     I thought we were supposed to be sparring today.

     TEYLA
     You were late, so Ronon and I...

   [Ronon knocks a rod from Teyla's hand as she turns her head to speak to
   Sheppard. The other rod flies from her grip too, Ronon grabs her by the
   throat and throws her to the mat, pinning her on her back with his rod
   in her face. Sheppard rushes over, grabs the rod and pushes Ronon
   away.]

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell do you think you're doing?

     RONON
     I wouldn't have hurt her.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, it sure the hell looked like you were going to.

   [Ronon walks away.]

     SHEPPARD
     You okay?

     TEYLA
     I am fine.

   [Ronon walks out of the gym, followed by his two guards.]

     TEYLA
     I told him that he did not have to go easy on me.

     SHEPPARD
     You've got to be careful what you say to this guy.

   INT--ATLANTIS, CADMAN'S QUARTERS

   [McKay is sitting on the bed, tying his shoelaces.]

     MCKAY
     No, it is completely out of the question.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Why? You'd rather go it alone?

     MCKAY
     Oh, yes, imagine that. I'd rather go it alone.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Well, consider the opportunity, right? To have a woman there with
     you, helping you out, feeding you lines. I really think you could
     learn something.

     MCKAY
     Thank for the offer, Cyrano, but I think I'll pass.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I was there when you bumped into her, okay? I felt how nervous and
     awkward you were.

     MCKAY
     I'm sure that has nothing to do with my current situation.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Come on, Rodney, let me do this for you. Maybe this is why this
     happened.

     MCKAY
     This is why this happened?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Yeah.

     MCKAY
     Are you insane?

     CADMAN
     Considering our situation here, I think I've been extremely
     reasonable. I can make this a living hell for you, Rodney. This is
     something I want to do, and we're doing it.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS, TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla is doing stretching exercises on her bed. The door opens,
   revealing Ronon standing outside. His two guards are behind him. Teyla
   sits up.]

     RONON
     I wanted to apologize.

     TEYLA
     Come in.

   [Ronon enters.]

     TEYLA

     Do not worry Ronon. It was... impressive.
     (offering him a seat)
     Please.

   [Ronon sits on a chair, facing Teyla.]

     TEYLA
     How are you finding your training?

     RONON
     You mean my test?

     TEYLA

     (concerned)
     Is that what you think?

     RONON
     Am I wrong?

     TEYLA
     Colonel Sheppard believes you can be of great help to us.

     RONON
     Why did you join them?

     TEYLA
     My people are strong and proud, but Atlantis is the best hope for us
     all. I suspect you see it, too, or you would have already left.

   INT--ATLANTIS, KATIE'S QUARTERS

   [Katie is putting an extra place at the table that she had set for
   dinner.]

     BECKETT
     I am so sorry. I thought he told you that I'd be joining you for
     dinner.

     KATIE
     Well, he has been under a lot of stress lately.

     BECKETT
     Yes. In fact, that's why I'm here.

     KATIE
     Is he all right?

   [The door open and McKay enters.]

     MCKAY
     I'm late. Sorry. Hi.

     KATIE
     Carson kept me company. Sit down. The first course is all set to go.

     MCKAY
     Carson.

     BECKETT
     Rodney.

     MCKAY

     (confused)
     What are you doing here?

     BECKETT

     (equally confused)
     You invited me.

     MCKAY
     Oh, I did? Did I? Yes!

     KATIE
     Please, sit.

   [Katie serves Beckett salad while McKay starts eating.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Don't start eating, you idiot! Make a toast first.

     MCKAY

     (whispers)
     Yes. Yes. Yes...
     (aloud)
     A toast.
     (raising his wineglass to Katie)
     To you. We've been working together for... some time now, a short
     time, but, um, in that time, I've often found our interchanges very,
     um...

   [Katie and Beckett exchange awkward looks.]

     MCKAY
     Ah... what I mean to say is that you are very funny and smart and...
     and, uh... And from what I can tell, you, you make a delicious
     salad. So... to you.

   [Katie smiles.]

     BECKETT
     Yes. Cheers.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     All right, good. That wasn't so bad. She's obviously into you, so at
     least we have that working for us. Now, I was thinking that we...

   [McKay begins drinking down his glass of wine.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Wait, McKay. McKay.

   [Katie looks uncomfortable at McKay.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Stop drinking the wine. You're going to get drunk. Actually, wait,
     yes! You need that to loosen up a bit.
     Finish it off!

   [McKay drains the glass.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Good boy. Yeah.

   [Katie and Beckett are eating in silence.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Say something, McKay. Come on, say something that'll start a
     conversation.

     MCKAY
     So, um... Do you, uh... um...

     KATIE

     (expectantly)
     Yes?

     MCKAY
     I forgot what I was going to say. What was it? Um...

   [McKay stands up, one hand on his hip.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Okay, this is ridiculous.

   [McKay walks around the table to where Katie is sitting and takes her
   hand in his.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Katie. I really like you. In fact, the past few months here have
     been made more livable, thanks to you. I wanted tonight to be
     special, but for reasons I can't go into now, I've got to leave.

     KATIE

     Oh.
     (standing up)
     I'm sorry to hear that.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     But I don't want you to be insulted or to wonder whether or not I am
     interested in you, because I am. I am very, very interested.

   [McKay takes Katie in his arms, dips her and kisses her, then he stands
   her up again and releases her.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     See you soon.

   [McKay turns around and puts one hand on Beckett's face for a moment,
   then walks out.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [McKay is walking along the corridor, seemingly talking to himself.]

     MCKAY
     Give me back my body. We have to go back.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     And do what? I bet that is the most honest you've ever been with a
     girl, and it wasn't even you.

   [McKay struggles to regain control of his body.]

     MCKAY
     I can't believe you're doing this.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     We just tried to do too much too fast, McKay.

   [McKay continues to struggle to turn around.]

     MCKAY
     Please. Please, go back.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Nope.

     MCKAY
     Uh, uh...rock, paper, scissors. I'm the left hand, you're the right.
     Cadman...

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Fine.

   [McKay plays rock, paper, scissors with himself, the left hand forming
   rock and the right forming paper.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Yay! Paper beats rock. We leave.

     MCKAY
     No. We...

   [McKay slaps himself on the face.]

     MCKAY
     Ow!

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Get ahold of yourself, man.

     ZELENKA

     (over the public address system)
     Dr. McKay, report to the hangar. Dr. McKay, report to the hangar.

     MCKAY
     Hello. That's us.

   [McKay turns around awkwardly.]

     MCKAY
     Thank you.

   [McKay walks off down the corridor.]

   INT--ATLANTIS HANGAR

   [A scientist puts a plastic box containing two white mice on a table.
   Sheppard and Weir look at them curiously as Zelenka shows McKay the
   work on his computer.]

     ZELENKA
     We've been running simulations all day. I think I may finally have
     something. I was able to get the generator to run on a buffer loop,
     which tricks the Dart into taking only the power that it needs
     without overloading.

     MCKAY
     Mm. Great. Good thinking. Now, can we just see it?

     WEIR
     Anxious?

     MCKAY
     Yes.

     ZELENKA
     Okay. Firing.

   [The Dart materializer unit is mounted in front of the table and fires
   a beam at the mice, which disappear from the box.]

     ZELENKA
     All right. Life-signs holding steady. Now, re-materialization
     initiated.

   [The beam fires again. Everyone has a look of disgust on their faces.
   The box contains two charred, smoking black mice.]

     SHEPPARD
     Now, I'm no scientist, but those mice used to be a different color.

     MCKAY
     This is never going to end. I'm going to be stuck like this forever.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, SUNRISE

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Weir is walking around the control room making notes on a tablet while
   Sheppard follows her.]

     WEIR
     I'm not sure it's a good idea, John.

     SHEPPARD
     Elizabeth, you've got to see this guy in action. He is an incredible
     shot. None of my guys could beat him in a fight, and he's
     ex-military.

     WEIR
     Yeah, not a military on Earth.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, look, the guy's got no place to go.

     WEIR
     You're not just being charitable?

     SHEPPARD
     No. I'm not, and I think he'd make a great addition to my team.

     WEIR
     We don't know anything about him.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, what's there to know?

   [Weir leaves the control room and towards her office where people are
   waiting for her. Sheppard follows.]

     WEIR
     Well, anything would be helpful. He's not very forthcoming.

     SHEPPARD
     He's been on the run from the Wraith for the past seven years. What
     do you expect? Look. Listen. Just talk to the guy. You owe him that,
     at least.

     WEIR
     Okay.

   [Weir goes into her office and Sheppard walks away with a slightly
   worried look on his face.]

   INT--ATLANTIS, HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

   [McKay sits opposite Heightmeyer on a sofa. McKay has is face in his
   hands then takes them away and looks up with an angry expression. McKay
   and Cadman are both speaking with McKay's voice, but he turns his head
   to the side when it's Cadman speaking.]

     MCKAY

     (as McKay)
     I would like an apology.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Laura?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Forget about it.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     You did take over his body without permission.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     He doesn't ask permission when he takes over.

     MCKAY

     (as McKay)
     You... because it's my body!

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Yeah, and I'm a guest. Try and be a little more courteous.

     MCKAY

     (as McKay)
     You see? Do you see what I have to put up with?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     "Put up with?"

     MCKAY

     (as McKay)
     (angrily)
     There's a lot of stuff that I am not doing right now that I would be
     doing.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     I don't want to hear about it.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     All right, you two. Settle down.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Huh.

     MCKAY
     Would you...

   INT--ATLANTIS, GYM

   [Ronon is teaching a group of Marines some knife fighting techniques.
   One of the Marines feigns attack and he goes through a series of
   moves.]

     RONON
     Thigh. Strip. Cut. Lift. Cut. And finish.

     MARINE
     Awesome.

   [The door opens and Weir enters.]

     WEIR
     Ronon.

     WEIR
     Can I have a word?

   [Ronon hands one of the Marines the practice knife.]

     RONON
     Here.

   [Ronon walks over to Weir. He folds his arms and waits for her to
   speak.]

     WEIR
     I understand Major Sheppard extended an invitation to you to join
     his team.

     RONON
     Yeah, he did.

     WEIR
     Well, he was supposed to speak to me about that first.

     RONON
     Okay.

     WEIR
     Look, it's not that I don't trust you, or value any contributions
     you may have to make. Or that you will make, if you do join us, it's
     just... it is a rather big decision.

   [Ronon doesn't answer.]

     WEIR
     So how do you feel?

     RONON
     I'm thinking about it.

     WEIR
     Okay. Good. Well, I'm thinking about it, too. So I guess we'll just
     keep in touch, then.

     RONON
     Okay.

   [Ronon turns and goes back to the training session.]

     WEIR
     Okay.

   [Weir watches as Ronon resumes his training.]

     RONON
     All right. Dismembering a defeating arm. Two knives. Slice. Cut.

   INT--ATLANTIS, HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE

   [McKay sits opposite Heightmeyer on a sofa. McKay has is face in his
   hands then takes them away and looks up with an angry expression. McKay
   and Cadman are both speaking with McKay's voice, but he turns his head
   to the side when it's Cadman speaking.]

     MCKAY
     You're the one who said set up rules. Well, I did. I followed them.
     I stuck to them! She basically hijacked me.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Hey. You had a real opportunity to get inside the mind of a woman
     and actually expand your horizons. But, no.

     MCKAY

     (becoming frantic)
     Did you ever, for a second, consider that I might not want to get
     inside a woman's...

   [Rodney starts having convulsions.]

     HEIGHTMEYER
     Rodney? Rodney!

   [Heightmeyer lies McKay on the floor then runs to the intercom.]

     HEIGHTMEYER
     This is Heightmeyer. Get Beckett in here stat!

   [McKay passes out.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [McKay wakes up in a bed in the infirmary. Beckett, Zelenka and
   Heightmeyer are standing by his bed.]

     MCKAY
     What happened?

     BECKETT
     You had a seizure.

     MCKAY
     Why?

     BECKETT
     From what we can tell, the constant fighting over the dominance of
     your brain is having a deleterious effect on its lower functions.
     Heart rate, respiration, organ function...

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     And that's not good.

     MCKAY
     Of course it's not good.

     BECKETT
     I'm not sure how long you can go on like this.

     MCKAY
     What do you mean?

     BECKETT
     These misfires will only increase in frequency and severity with
     time.

     MCKAY
     Fine. She'll stop trying to take control of my body.

     BECKETT
     It's not as simple as that, Rodney.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     One of you has to release control. One of you has to let go
     completely.

     MCKAY
     Oh, well, maybe if someone, say you, hadn't told her to try and take
     control in the first place, none of this would've happened.

     HEIGHTMEYER
     I was just trying to help both of you.

     MCKAY
     What happens to the person, the one who "lets go"?

     BECKETT
     Well, we're not certain, of course. It's not like we've run into a
     lot of these situations before.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     They would disappear. I know they would, because I can already feel
     it happening to me. It's getting harder to be in here. It's taking
     more of an effort.

     MCKAY
     Has it always been like that?

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     The past few hours. You haven't felt it too?

     MCKAY
     Of course I have, but I just thought I was fighting with you.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Look, where are we at?

     ZELENKA
     Well, we successfully re-materialized a pair of mice. They were
     whole and correctly reconstructed...

     MCKAY
     But?

     ZELENKA
     They didn't survive.

     BECKETT
     I'm afraid that if one of you doesn't let go, both of you will die.

     MCKAY
     I'll do it.

     BECKETT
     Which one of you said that?

   [McKay doesn't answer.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Beckett and Heightmeyer are off to one side of the room, talking.
   McKay lies in bed, talking with Cadman.]

     MCKAY
     You don't have to do this.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Yes, I do, Rodney. It's your body, and you're not going to do it.

     MCKAY
     Oh, what makes you so sure?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     They need you here, and as much as I hate to admit it, I'm not as
     important as...

     MCKAY
     Stop it. That's not true.

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Carson? I need something to write with.

     MCKAY
     What are you doing?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I'm going to write a letter to my folks. I'd appreciate it if you
     delivered it yourself the next time you gate back to Earth, Rodney.
     Explain what happened.

     MCKAY
     Well, I'm not sure when I'll... The gate. We can use the gate!

     BECKETT
     What are you talking about?

     MCKAY
     The gate dematerializes you as you step into it, sending your
     information to the next gate so it can re-materialize you on the
     other side.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     We know that.

     MCKAY

     (becoming excited)
     If we can take one of the crystal control modules from the gate and
     interface it with the Dart, we should be able to build a stable
     system.

   [McKay tries to get out of bed but Beckett stops him.]

     BECKETT
     Rodney, wait. I don't think you're in any condition to do this.

     MCKAY
     I don't have time to talk. I need to get this done before the next
     seizure.

   [McKay gets out of bed and runs off.]

   INT--ATLANTIS HANGAR

   [Zelenka looks on while McKay, still in scrubs but wearing a robe over
   them, places crystal in a control module which is wired up to the Dart
   module.]

     MCKAY
     All right, let's do this.

     ZELENKA
     Well, just because it works in simulation doesn't mean...

     MCKAY
     I would prefer not to suffer a fatal seizure while we wait for you
     to round up more mice for testing, so, shall we?

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Rodney...

     MCKAY
     Don't try and talk me out of this. I may very well listen.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     I was just going to say, "thanks".

     MCKAY
     Well, you're welcome. I can honestly say that the entire experience
     has been very, um...

   [Beckett, Weir and Sheppard arrive.]

     MCKAY
     Ah. About time.

     SHEPPARD
     Hold on, Rodney. I thought all the mice died.

     MCKAY
     Well, what are we, mice or men?

     WEIR
     Are you sure about this?

     MCKAY
     Absolutely. Yes.

   [Everyone looks very concerned.]

     WEIR
     Okay.

     MCKAY
     Just give me a sec.

   [McKay steps into the beam target area.]

     MCKAY
     Well, Laura, it's been, um... unique.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     To say the least.

     MCKAY
     Good luck us both, hmm?

   [Zelenka punches keys on the computer.]

     ZELENKA

     All right. It's ready.
     (to the others)
     I suggest you take a step back.
     (to the computer)
     All right.

   [McKay raises a finger.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Wait!

   [McKay walks over the Beckett, takes him by the lapels and kisses him.]

     MCKAY

     (as Cadman)
     Just in case this doesn't work.

     MCKAY

     (stepping back to the target area)
     Oh... oh... just... just... Hit it.

   [Zelenka hits a button, the beam fires and McKay disappears. The
   computer screen shows two blips.]

     ZELENKA
     Okay. It's reading as two life-signs. Power levels are steady...

     SHEPPARD
     Get 'em out of there.

   [Zelenka hits another button, the two blips disappear from the screen
   and both McKay and Cadman re-materialize in the beam target area. They
   both fall to the floor, unconscious.]

     BECKETT
     Let's get them to the infirmary.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, SUNSET

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Sheppard catches up with Weir.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, did you get the chance to talk to Ronon?

     WEIR
     Yes, I did. Chatty fellow, isn't he?

     SHEPPARD
     And?

     WEIR
     He would be your responsibility.

     SHEPPARD
     I knew you'd say yes.

     WEIR
     I haven't said yes.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you were about to.

     WEIR
     Yes.

     SHEPPARD
     There you go.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [McKay wakes up, his blurred vision just making out Weir, Sheppard and
   Zelenka sitting near his bed.]

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Feeling better?

   [McKay looks at the empty bed to his left.]

     MCKAY
     Oh, no.

     CADMAN

     (voice)
     Over here...

   [McKay turns to the right, where Cadman is lying in a bed, waving at
   him.]

     MCKAY
     Oh. Um... a little less crowded. You?

     CADMAN
     Same. It's nice to have my own body back.

     BECKETT
     You're doing supremely well.

     MCKAY

     Oh, good to hear.
     (to Zelenka)
     Nice work.

     ZELENKA
     Well, it was your idea.

     MCKAY
     Well, of course it was, but you... you were... there.

     SHEPPARD

     (To Cadman)
     Lieutenant, way to survive what I think may be my worst nightmare.

     CADMAN
     Thank you, Sir.

     MCKAY
     Yes, thank you.

     WEIR
     I imagine you two might want a moment.

     CADMAN
     Actually, Ma'am, I think I'd like some time alone.

     MCKAY
     Same here. It's, um, it's been a while.

     WEIR

     (to Beckett)
     All right, release them as soon as you can.

     BECKETT
     Aye.

   [Everyone walks away, Beckett giving Cadman's hand a squeeze before he
   goes. Cadman smiles at McKay and he smiles uncomfortably back.]

     MCKAY
     Hey.

   [McKay turns his head away and sighs heavily.]

   FADE OUT
