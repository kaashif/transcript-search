   TEASER

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Ronon, Sheppard, and McKay stare down into the room.]

     RONON
     It's just weird.

   [They watch as medical staff in hazmat suits check Beckett out.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

     KELLER

     (with weak smile)
     I'm...sorry about all this, Doctor.

     BECKETT
     That's all right. I realize there's a protocol when dealing with
     someone who's been a prisoner for a long time. In fact, I wrote it.
     Although if you take much more blood, I think I might faint.

   [He looks at the blood vial being drawn.]

     KELLER

     (with reassuring smile)
     That's the last batch.

     BECKETT
     You should also check for trace narcotics. Michael was giving me
     regular injections of some sort of drug cocktail. Mostly sedatives,
     I think.

   [Keller nods nervously.]

     KELLER
     All right.

   [Beckett smiles up at the trio watching him.]

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

     SHEPPARD
     You sure he's not a Replicator?

     MCKAY
     No, scans would've picked it up right away.

     SHEPPARD
     Then who the hell is he?

     MCKAY
     I don't know! Look, I'm as freaked out about this as you are!

     SHEPPARD
     You don't really think it's him, do you?

     MCKAY
     No. Well, I mean...maybe. Look, so we've ruled out advanced
     robotics, that still leaves us a-a half a dozen possible other
     explanations.

     RONON
     Like?

     MCKAY
     Well, like alternate timeline, parallel universe, cloning...you
     know, take your pick.

     SHEPPARD
     Just another day in outer space.

     MCKAY
     Yeah.

   [Keller enters.]

     KELLER
     Well, we've completed the preliminary exam.

     MCKAY
     And?

     KELLER
     Every test we've run confirms it. That man down there is Doctor
     Carson Beckett.

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

   [Beckett paces the room. McKay enters.]

     BECKETT

     (pleased)
     Rodney!

     MCKAY
     Carson. So sorry I haven't come by before now, it's been...pretty
     hectic here the last few days.

     BECKETT
     That's all right. I understand. Any word on when I can get out of
     here?

     MCKAY
     That might...take a little time.

     BECKETT

     (nonplussed)
     Oh. Really.

   [McKay breaks into a smile and puts out his hand.]

     MCKAY
     God, it's good to see you.

   [Beckett shakes it.]

     BECKETT
     Think about how I feel. I'm the one that's been a prisoner for
     almost two years.

   [He sits. McKay sits in the chair across from him.]

     MCKAY
     Two years?

     BECKTT
     Aye. Since M8G-352. The planet where we left Michael and the other
     converted Wraith.

     MCKAY

     (nonplussed)
     Right. That's where you were captured.

     BECKTT
     Well, yes. You do remember, Rodney?

     MCKAY
     Yes, yeah, I just--. Well, we need you to fill in some of the
     details.

     BECKETT
     Oh, well, all right. Well, as you may have already guessed, the
     treatment was less than a hundred percent effective.

   FLASHBACK

   [Scenes from SGA 3.02 "Misbegotten" are shown, of the Wraith conversion
   process.]

     BECKETT

     (voiceover)
     Despite the daily injections, some of them began to revert,
     including Michael. I think they may have used their Wraith
     telepathic abilities to summon a hive ship, but I can't be certain.
     All I know is, I was being interrogated by Michael, then he must
     have given me an injection of some kind, because the next thing I
     remember, I woke up on another planet.

   END FLASHBACK

     MCKAY
     Why'd he take you prisoner?

     BECKETT
     He wanted help with his research, combining Wraith and human DNA. Of
     course, I refused at first. But then, one day, he brought another
     prisoner into my cell--a young lady, couldn't have been more than
     twenty years of age. And he killed her in cold blood right in front
     of my eyes. He said every day I refused to help, he'd kill another
     just like her. From that moment on, I cooperated.

   [McKay looks heartbroken.]

     MCKAY
     Carson, I'm-I'm so sorry.

     BECKETT
     It wasn't easy. I'll admit, at times I almost gave up hope. But
     that's when I thought about you, Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, and the
     rest of the team. I knew you'd be out there somewhere looking for
     me.

   [McKay can no longer look at Beckett.]

     MCKAY
     Yeah...See, the thing is...we weren't.

     BECKETT
     Weren't what?

     MCKAY
     We weren't looking for you. We didn't even know you were missing.

     BECKETT
     Excuse me?

     MCKAY
     We went back to M8G-352. We...rescued you from Michael. I mean, he
     got away, but we got you back to Atlantis, safe and sound.

     BECKETT

     (affronted)
     What in the hell are you talking about?

     MCKAY
     Well, obviously not you-you, but another you. Another...Carson
     Beckett.

     BECKETT
     Is this a joke?

     MCKAY
     I wish it was.

     BECKETT
     You're telling me there's another Carson Beckett walking around this
     base.

     MCKAY
     Well, no.

     BECKETT

     (exasperated)
     Rodney!

     MCKAY
     He came back from the planet. He resumed his duties. Everything went
     back to normal. Then, about six months later...he was killed in an
     explosion. To us, you weren't missing, Carson. You-you were dead.

   [Beckett is stunned.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Sheppard and Carter head from the Control Room towards her office.]

     CARTER
     Have you spoken to your Wraith contact?

     SHEPPARD
     He claims he's given us everything he knows about Michael, but uh, I
     assume he's lying. Until we can come up with something that he can
     use, he's not much good to us.

     CARTER
     So we need to find our intel somewhere else.

     SHEPPARD
     That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

   [Carter sighs.]

     CARTER
     You mean Beckett.

     SHEPPARD
     He has been inside Michael's operation, and he may know something.

     CARTER
     Or he could have been planted there for us to find. Look, for all we
     know, this whole thing could be a setup.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh sure, anything's possible.

     CARTER

     (sympathetically)
     John, the Carson Beckett you knew was killed. You were there; you
     all were. I'm sorry to say it, but you need to remember that.

   INT--ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM

     MCKAY
     I know this is a lot for you to take in...

     BECKETT
     Aye, you're damn right it is! First you tell me I'm not the only
     Carson Beckett, and then you tell me the other one died in a
     horrible explosion! Oh my God. My mother! You didn't tell her, did
     you?

     MCKAY
     Well...yeah.

     BECKETT
     Good lord!

     MCKAY
     You were dead! I mean, I'm sorry to be blunt, but we buried you. I
     mean, there was a memorial service at her church. I was there.

     BECKETT

     (half-hysterical)
     This can't be happening! I have to get back there. I have to talk to
     her!

   [The both stand.]

     MCKAY
     No, you can't! I mean you have any idea what kind of effect that
     could have?! I mean, besides, what are you going to say to her?

     BECKETT
     I'll say the Air Force made a bloody mistake, that's what I'll say!

     MCKAY

     (placating)
     Carson...

     BECKETT
     No, Rodney, this is too much! Get Doctor Weir in here! I need to
     speak to her right now!

   [McKay is speechless.]

     BECKETT
     What?

     MCKAY
     I can't do that.

     BECKETT
     Why not?!

     MCKAY

     (quietly)
     She's dead, Carson. She was killed by the Replicators. Sacrificed
     herself to save the rest of us. I'm sorry. I-I don't know what else
     to say.

   [Beckett sits back down.]

     BECKETT

     (brokenly)
     You know, for the better part of two years, I imagined what it would
     be like the day I finally got back to Atlantis. This isn't exactly
     how I pictured it.

   EXT--ABANDONED CITY, DAY

   [Michael's ship is parked by the city.]

   EXT--CITY STREETS, DAY

   [Michael, Teyla, Kanaan and other guards walk the streets of the city.]

     TEYLA
     What is this place?

     MICHAEL
     Just another dead world. Destroyed by the Wraith. Abandoned by the
     survivors. Forgotten by both. A perfect place to conduct my work.

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [He leads Teyla to a large door.]

     MICHAEL
     Open it.

   [His minions unlock and open the door.]

     MICHAEL
     I'll leave you to get reacquainted.

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

   [Teyla enters. Several people rise at her approach.]

     HALLING
     Teyla?

   [Teyla turns to see Halling coming down a staircase.]

     TEYLA
     Halling?

   [They reach out and greet each other in the Athosian manner, foreheads
   touching.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Carter approaches Keller.]

     CARTER
     What have you got for me, Doctor?

     KELLER
     I think I've solved the mystery. You know what a telomere is,
     Colonel?

     CARTER
     It's part of a human chromosome, right?

   [Keller leads her to a monitor.]

     KELLER
     Yeah, that's right. Each time a cell divides, the chromosome is torn
     apart and rebuilt. And in the process, a small amount of the
     telomere gets used up. As a result, telomeres become...shorter over
     time. The more we age, the shorter they get.

     CARTER
     And this is Doctor Beckett's?

     KELLER
     Yeah. According to the scan, his telomeres are thirty percent
     shorter than they should be for a man of his age. The only
     explanation is that the original DNA came from an adult cell, one
     where the telomeres had already started to degrade.

     CARTER

     (wincing)
     So...

     KELLER
     You can forget parallel universes. He's a clone.

   [Carter sighs.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

   [Teyla sits with Halling and another woman on some crates.]

     TEYLA
     I did not ever think I would ever see you again.

     HALLING
     Nor did we. I just wish it were under happier circumstances.

     TEYLA
     Where are the rest of our people?

     WOMAN
     They were taken.

     TEYLA
     Taken?

     WOMAN
     To be experimented upon. Converted into one of those...things.

     TEYLA
     How long has this been going on?

     HALLING
     For months. Since the day of our arrival.

     WOMAN

     (gently)
     Kanaan was one of the first.

     TEYLA
     I know. I saw him on Michael's ship. But I did not realize it had
     happened to so many. I am so sorry. I should've been at the village
     the day you were captured.

     HALLING
     There was nothing you could've done. Fifty men armed with stunners
     infiltrated our village under cover of night. We were taken
     completely by surprise.

     WOMAN
     These four walls have been our prison ever since.

     TEYLA
     You must not abandon hope. The people of Atlantis know of my
     disappearance, and they are looking for me. It will not be long
     before they come to our rescue.

     WOMAN
     That is a very pleasant thought. But until today, we held out the
     same hope about you.

   [Teyla sighs.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Beckett is shown the results. McKay, Keller, and a marine are nearby.]

     KELLER
     I know you would want to...see the results for yourself.

     BECKETT
     And you're certain it's from my sample?

     KELLER
     I ran the test myself, twice. There's no mistake. I'm sorry.

     MCKAY
     It doesn't matter.

     BECKETT
     Well, that's easy for you to say, but you're not the one who just
     found out he was made in a test tube.

     MCKAY
     As far as I'm concerned, one of the best friends I ever had just
     came back from the dead. I'm not going to quibble over a couple
     of...telomeres!

     BECKETT
     Thank you kindly for that, but it still doesn't change the fact that
     I'm not the "real" Carson Beckett.

     MCKAY
     No, no you're not! Because the real Carson Beckett wouldn't be
     standing here feeling sorry for himself. He'd be trying to figure
     out how to try and help us!

     BECKETT
     I'm willing to do whatever I can, Rodney, but I'm not so sure that
     my help would be wanted.

     MCKAY

     (blankly)
     Why wouldn't it be?

   [Beckett turns and looks at the marine guarding him. Rodney finally
   understands.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [McKay and Sheppard are with Carter.]

     CARTER
     We're talking about someone who was for all intents and purposes,
     manufactured by one of the most dangerous individuals we've ever
     come across. Fundamentally, he's not that different from those
     hybrids, and I doubt very much we'd be arguing about whether we can
     trust them.

     MCKAY
     But there's no denying the fact that he's no ordinary clone. I mean,
     somehow, Michael has managed to reproduce his...memories, his
     thought processes, I mean, his personality! I've spent some time
     with him, and I-I'm telling you, he's Carson!

     CARTER
     It doesn't necessarily mean it's safe to act on any information he
     might give us. Look, he may genuinely believe that he's helping us,
     and still be playing right into Michael's hand.

     SHEPPARD
     She's got a point, Rodney. What exactly is he offering?

     MCKAY
     He knows the layouts of at least, uh, four facilities that Michael
     has on different planets. Apparently he likes to move around a lot,
     stay one step ahead of the Wraith.

     SHEPPARD
     What about 'gate addresses?

     MCKAY
     Well, they blindfolded him every time they moved him, so he couldn't
     see the DHD. Although, he did catch a glimpse of an address dialed
     by one of Michael's, uh, mercenaries. That could be a place to
     start.

   [Carter and Sheppard exchange looks.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GEAR-UP ROOM

   [Sheppard's team and another team gear up. Beckett is also there,
   gearing up anxiously. McKay looks worried.]

     BECKETT
     Go ahead, Rodney. I'll catch up.

   [McKay takes his radio and leaves with the other team. Ronon also goes,
   barely glancing at Beckett as he leaves. Only Sheppard and Beckett are
   left. Beckett looks as Ronon passes.]

     BECKETT

     (to Sheppard)
     Is he ever going to say a word to me?

     SHEPPARD
     You gotta give him a break. He's not good dealing with this sort of
     thing.

     BECKETT
     What sort of thing?

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, you know. Clones. Duplicates. People coming back from the dead.
     We went through this with Elizabeth.

     BECKETT
     Rodney told me. It must be difficult.

     SHEPPARD
     He'll come around.

     BECKETT
     Aye.

   [Beckett struggles to put on his pack. Sheppard helps him.]

     BECKETT
     Thank you. I must be a wee bit rusty.

     SHEPPARD
     You're not rusty, Doc. You were just never very good at this.

     BECKETT
     Fair enough.

   [They start to leave. Beckett holds Sheppard back.]

     BECKETT
     John, I just want to say, thank you...for trusting me. You'll have
     no regrets.

   [He taps him on the chest reassuringly and starts to leave.]

     SHEPPARD
     Doc?

     BECKETT
     Aye?

     SHEPPARD
     You forgot your radio.

   [He tosses it to Beckett. Beckett catches it and waves it around.]

     BECKETT
     No regrets.

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--VILLAGE, NIGHT

   INT--VILLAGE TAVERN

   [The Lantian team enter the tavern. Everyone falls silent, watching the
   newcomers.]

     SHEPPARD

     (under his breath)
     Just in time for happy hour.
     (to barkeep)
     I was hoping maybe you could help us. We're looking for a friend of
     ours who's been know to stop in now and then?

     BARKEEP
     You've come to the wrong place.

     MCKAY
     We haven't even told you what he looks like.

     BARKEEP
     You misunderstood me. No one here cares what he looks like. You've
     come to the wrong place if you're looking for information.

   [Sheppard leans over the bar.]

     SHEPPARD

     (sotto voce)
     Look, I know you're trying to keep up appearances here for your
     friends, but, uh, I think we can make it worth your while.

     BARKEEP
     I think it would be best if you turn around and be on your way.

   [Ronon looks keenly at an open doorway on the second story.]

     RONON
     Gun!

   [The team scatters, taking cover. The barkeep is riddled with bullets.]

     SHEPPARD
     That's P-90 fire!

   [Sheppard and Ronon return fire, Ronon catching the shooter when his
   clip is empty. The shooter falls over the balcony to the first floor.
   Beckett immediately rushes over, checking him for injuries.]

     MCKAY
     Is he dead?

     BECKETT
     No, but we need to get him back to Atlantis as soon as possible.

   [Sheppard exchanges looks with his teammates.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Carter waits by an active wormhole. Keller and a medical team arrive
   with a gurney.]

     KELLER
     What is it?

     CARTER
     Colonel Sheppard's team is coming back. They've got injuries.

   [Sheppard's team arrives. The other team carries the injured man on a
   stretcher.]

     CARTER
     What happened?

     SHEPPARD
     Someone took a shot at us with a P-90. We're okay, but, you
     know...he took a little header off the balcony.

     CARTER
     A P-90? Where'd he get it?

     SHEPPARD
     That's the question.

   [Beckett takes charge of transferring the injured man to the gurney.]

     BECKETT
     On three, one, two, three, up.

   [Keller starts to examine the man.]

     BECKETT
     GSC 6. Respiration 16, Pulse 150. Blood pressure 70 over 30. I
     applied pressure bandages at the scene.

   [Keller nods, peeling away some of the head bandages to look at him
   more closely. She back up in surprise.]

     BECKETT
     What is it?

     KELLER
     I know this man. His name's Nabel. When Teyla and I went to New
     Athos, he was there. He tried to kill us!

   [Sheppard and Carter exchange looks. Beckett starts to lead the team
   wheeling Nabel out.]

     BECKETT
     That's all right, love. He's unconscious now. And for the time
     being, in desperate need of our attention. You can confront him
     later. Right now, we need to save his life. Let's go, lads.

   INT--ATLANTIS OPERATING ROOM

   [Keller and Beckett are among the team prepping for surgery.]

     KELLER
     Blood pressure?

     MARIE
     Fifty over forty.

     KELLER
     It's dropping. We need to stop this bleeding. I need suction! Let's
     prep for a C-spine x-ray.

     BECKETT
     What can I do?

     KELLER
     Grab some clamps and get busy.

     BECKETT
     Right.

   [Beckett heads over to a medical tray. As he bends over, he gets
   dizzy.]

     KELLER
     I'm guessing some pretty severe lacerations--

   [Beckett faints, knocking over the tray as he falls.]

     KELLER
     Carson?!

   [Keller immediately goes to him.]

     KELLER
     Get him to a bed, now!

   [Some of the medical team lift him out of the operating room as a
   worried Keller goes back to treating Nabel.]

   INT--CARTER'S OFFICE

   [Carter speaks with Ronon, Sheppard, and McKay.]

     CARTER
     It was Doctor Beckett's idea to go there.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, if we hadn't have gone, we wouldn't have captured one of
     Michael's operative.

     CARTER
     You also wouldn't have been nearly killed in an ambush!

     RONON
     It wasn't that bad.

   [Carter shoots him a skeptical look.]

     RONON
     It was one guy.

     CARTER
     Firing at you with one of our own weapons!

     MCKAY
     He was Michael's spy in the Athosian village! Look, he got the P-90
     from the weapons cache we left there.

     CARTER
     It doesn't change the fact that you were led into ambush,
     intentionally or not.

     KELLER

     (over radio)
     Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller. You'd better come down to the
     infirmary. There's a problem with Doctor Beckett.

   [Carter gives the others a look.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Carter, Sheppard, McKay, Ronon, and Keller stand over Beckett's
   infirmary bed. He is unconscious and wearing an oxygen mask.]

     KELLER
     After he collapsed, I did a scan and found evidence of necrosis in
     several of his internal organs. His cells aren't renewing fast
     enough to sustain tissue function.

     CARTER
     Any idea why?

     KELLER

     (shaking her head)
     I can only assume it's a complication due to the fact he's a clone.
     I've given him a course of...treatment to try and stimulate cell
     growth, but...it's a bit like trying to find a cure for old age.

     SHEPPARD
     What are you saying?

     KELLER
     On the outside, he looks fine, but...on the inside, well,
     he's...he's dying.

   [Later, Beckett is conscious. The oxygen mask has been removed and the
   bed inclined so he's sitting up. McKay and Keller are at his bedside.]

     BECKETT
     My lord. No wonder I've felt like a dog's breakfast ever since I got
     here.

     KELLER
     I'm sorry, Carson. I wish there was something we could do.

     MCKAY
     Why is this happening now?

     KELLER
     What do you mean?

     MCKAY
     Well, you survived for almost two years with Michael. I mean,
     shouldn't you have felt some kind of effects from this condition
     before now?

     KELLER
     Well, that's a good point. Don't take this the wrong way, but at the
     rate your cells are deteriorating, you should've died a long time
     ago.

   [Beckett thinks back.]

     BECKETT

     (realizing)
     The weekly injection he gave me. He said it was a sedative meant to
     keep me from trying to escape. But it must have been some kind of
     drug...to keep my cells from deteriorating.

     KELLER
     Well, you obviously don't have any of it with you.

     BECKETT
     No. Michael administered it himself, one dose at a time. But when
     Colonel Sheppard's team rescued me, it had only been four days since
     my last injection. Now, assuming it takes a full seven days to break
     down...

     KELLER
     We scanned you when you got here.

     BECKETT
     Exactly. And if the scanner was able to pick it up, we might be able
     to isolate it and create more. We need to get started right away.

   [He starts to get out of bed. Keller pushes him back.]

     KELLER
     Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going?

     BECKETT
     We have work to do!

     KELLER
     No, I have work to do. You need to stay in bed. The less you exert
     yourself, the better.

     BECKETT
     You don't seriously expect me to lie here and be useless when my own
     life hangs in the balance, do you?

   [Keller looks to McKay, who shrugs.]

   EXT--MICHAEL'S SANCTUARY, NIGHT

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

   [Teyla, sitting near the door, hears footsteps outside. She goes and
   looks out. Kanaan stands there.]

     TEYLA
     Kanaan, look at me.

   [Kanaan reluctantly looks over.]

     TEYLA
     You know who I am. I do not know what Michael has done to you, but I
     do know that, deep down, part of you is still the man I remember. I
     need your help.

   [Kanaan moves closer. Teyla looks back at the other Athosians.]

     TEYLA
     We...need your help. If we do not find a way out of here quickly,
     Michael will force on us what he has forced on you. Our child will
     be born soon, and when he is, Michael will take him to use for some
     terrible purpose. You must not let that happen.

   [There is a distant clang. Kanaan hurries away.]

     TEYLA

     (emotional)
     Kanaan, wait!

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Keller and Beckett work side by side. Beckett looks away from the
   microscope he's been using.]

     BECKETT
     I'm going cross-eyed.

     KELLER
     It's gotta be in here somewhere. We must be missing something.

     BECKETT
     We've been over everything twice. Maybe the drug breaks down faster
     than we thought.

   [Keller's computer beeps.]

     KELLER
     Wait a minute.

     BECKETT
     What?

     KELLER
     Unidentified polypeptide chain. The scan found it in one of your
     kidney cells.

     BECKETT
     Try scanning it for traces of Wraith DNA.

   [Keller does so. The computer monitor displays an identified match.]

     KELLER
     My god. It must be a Wraith enzyme of some sort.

   [The computer starts spitting out screen after screen of data.]

     KELLER
     But it's enormously complex. It's not going to be easy to duplicate.

     BECKETT

     (gulping)
     Right then.

   [He gets back to work.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

   [Teyla and the others are awakened by the door clanging open and some
   of Michael's worshippers entering. They look around. Teyla looks ready
   to do battle but Halling holds her back.]

     HALLING
     Do not incite them!

   [The lead worshipper's gaze alights on Teyla. He points.]

     GUARD
     Her!

     HALLING
     No! You will take me instead.

   [He steps in front of Teyla. One of the guards backhands him, knocking
   the weakened man to the floor.]

     TEYLA
     Halling!

   [She and others go to help him. The worshipper guards pull Teyla back.]

     TEYLA
     No!

   [She resists but can't shake their firm grip. Halling struggles to his
   feet, but is still winded.]

     HALLING
     No! No! No! Ach!

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Beckett is looking through a microscope. Keller gives some tests to
   Marie.]

     KELLER
     Just let me know when you have test results on those.

     MARIE
     Okay.

     KELLER
     Thanks.

   [Beckett sighs and winces.]

     BECKETT
     Damn it.

     KELLER
     What is it?

     BECKETT
     See for yourself.

   [He moves so she can look through the microscope.]

     KELLER

     (disappointed)
     The primer's not annealing to the DNA template.

     BECKETT
     There's too many contaminants. We're back to square one.

     KELLER
     I'm sorry, Carson, but we've only been at this for a little while. I
     mean, you knew it wasn't going to be easy.

     BECKETT
     I was hoping for a breakthrough by now.

   [He winces and grimaces in pain.]

     KELLER
     Carson?

     BECKETT

     (through pained breaths)
     It's all right. I'm okay.

     KELLER
     No, you're not. Your condition's getting worse.

   [Beckett weakly clambers back onto his stool.]

     BECKETT
     I'll be fine. It was a just a wee bit of a dizzy spell. Now, get me
     some of those PCR tubes, will you? Please.

     KELLER
     You can't just ignore this.

     BECKETT
     What else can I do?

     KELLER
     We could halt the deterioration of your cells in a stasis pod.

     BECKETT
     Oh, no. You're not putting me in one of those things.

     KELLER
     But it makes sense! I mean, that way, when I figure out how to fix
     this--

     BECKETT
     What if you can't? I'll be stuck in that bloody machine for God
     knows how long.

     KELLER
     Isn't that better than trying in vain to solve this while the
     clock's ticking away on your own life?

     BECKETT

     (stubbornly)
     No.

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Several individuals lie in strange glass stasis pods. In the center of
   the lab, Teyla lies strapped by her wrists and ankles to a table that
   is inclined at a forty-five degree angle. She hears a noise behind
   her.]

     TEYLA

     (nervously)
     Michael? Is that you?

   [Kanaan steps forward into her line of vision.]

     TEYLA

     (pleading)
     Kanaan. Quickly, you must release me. Michael will be here soon. He
     will do to me what he has done to you. Please! I can help you
     escape. All of you.

   [Kanaan has been looking around as Teyla speaks. He looks closer at
   Teyla as if seeing her for the first time.]

     KANAAN
     Teyla?

     TEYLA

     (tearfully)
     Yes! It's me.

   [Kanaan reaches out and touches her stomach, sighing in wonder. He
   tries to pull off her wrist restraints. Unable to move them, he grasps
   a knife from nearby to use as a lever.]

     TEYLA

     (encouraging)
     Yes. That's it.

   [Kanaan suddenly stops, standing as if frozen, hiding the knife from
   view.]

     TEYLA
     Kanaan? What is it?

   [Michael storms into the room. He appears surprised to see Kanaan
   beside Teyla. He studies them both closely. Kanaan meets his gaze.]

     MICHAEL

     (to Kanaan)
     Leave us.

   [Kanaan leaves.]

     MICHAEL
     Now...let's get started.

   [Teyla looks very afraid.]

   INT--ATLANTIS RECOVERY ROOM

   [Nabel is conscious. Keller and Sheppard's team stand over him.]

     NABEL
     I see you've once again opted to save my life.

     KELLER

     (coldly)
     It wasn't an easy decision, let me tell you.

     SHEPPARD
     The only reason she did is because we need information.

     NABEL
     About Michael. Yes, I know. Too bad you wasted your effort. You
     should have just let me die.

   [McKay and Ronon exchange amused looks.]

     MCKAY

     (caustically)
     Why is that?

     NABEL
     Because once Michael finds out I was captured, I'm as good as dead
     anyway.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, maybe, or maybe not if you help us find him.

     NABEL
     He has spies everywhere. There's nowhere in this galaxy he can't
     find me.

     SHEPPARD
     Who said anything about this galaxy?

   [Nabel looks over, intrigued.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Michael starts powering up some Wraith equipment with a sensor.]

     MICHAEL
     I've had to modify this technology for use with humans. It's crude,
     but it works remarkably well.

     TEYLA

     (fighting to stay calm)
     Michael...whatever has happened between us in the past, I beg
     you...do not harm my child!

     MICHAEL
     I wouldn't dream of it. Now, just relax. This won't hurt a bit.
     Listen.

   [He runs the sensor over Teyla's abdomen. A steady pulse sounds--the
   baby's heartbeat.]

     MICHAEL
     Your child is healthy. Look.

   [An image similar to a 3-D ultrasound appears on the screen. Teyla
   bites back tears.]

     TEYLA

     (quietly)
     Why are you doing this?

   [He shuts off the device and smiles.]

     TEYLA
     On the ship! Kanaan said "our son would serve the cause." What did
     he mean by that?

     MICHAEL
     You have the gift. So does Kanaan. Have you stopped to think what
     that might mean for your son? He is genetically unique. And while
     I've made a lot of progress with my hybrids, there are still some
     details that need to be worked out. This child will help me do that.

   [Teyla looks at Michael in horror. He turns around and reaches for a
   syringe, filling it with a green liquid.]

     MICHAEL
     You've taken good care of him. You should be very proud. Even
     so...you could probably use a little help.

   [Teyla shakes her head in denial.]

     TEYLA

     (begging)
     Michael, what are you doing? Please.

     MICHAEL
     I need this child. I can't afford to let anything happen to him.

   [He injects Teyla's abdomen with the syringe. Teyla braces herself but
   huffs and writhes in pain.]

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [Carter meets Sheppard as he heads to her office.]

     CARTER
     How'd it go?

     SHEPPARD
     Nabel gave up the address. We know where she is.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Beckett draws a map of Michael's lab complex on a whiteboard as he
   briefs Carter and Sheppard's team.]

     BECKETT
     It's one of Michael's bigger facilities. The lab is located in the
     center of the main building, but it's difficult to find. Not to
     mention the fact that if he is there, he'll be heavily guarded.

     SHEPPARD

     (sarcastic)
     Great.

     CARTER
     You're sure this is the right place?

     BECKETT

     (confidently)
     I definitely recognize the description Nabel gave. Trust me, this is
     the place...You should bring me with you.

   [Everyone exchanges looks.]

     BECKETT
     This is just a small part of the complex. The place is like a maze.
     And once inside, it's very easy to get turned around.

     CARTER

     (in dismissive tone)
     All right. Thank you, Doctor.

   [Beckett sighs, then caps his pen and leaves.]

     CARTER
     So, what do you think?

     RONON
     Well, if he is leading us into a trap, it's not going to make much
     difference whether he's there or not.

     SHEPPARD
     But if he isn't, he could be pretty useful.

     MCKAY
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. If he goes on this mission,
     it could kill him. We can't ask him to do this.

     CARTER
     We didn't ask him. He volunteered.

     MCKAY

     (caustic)
     Give me a break.

     SHEPPARD
     Easy, Rodney.

     MCKAY
     I'm sorry, I'm just a little concerned that we're willing to be so
     cavalier with his life because we think of him as some kind of a-a
     cheap copy!

     SHEPPARD
     He's doing it for Teyla. Don't stand there and pretend that you
     wouldn't do the same thing if you were in his place.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Beckett walks down the corridor with his escort. Suddenly he doubles
   over in pain, falling to his knees. The guard helps him back to his
   feet. McKay, in another side corridor, witnesses this and runs over.]

     BECKETT

     (to escort)
     It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm all right. Thank you. Okay.

     MCKAY
     Carson!

     BECKETT

     (panting)
     Rodney. I was just heading in to get geared up.

     MCKAY

     (worried)
     Look at you. You can barely stand. You don't have to do this!

     BECKETT
     You said yourself the real Carson wouldn't sit around worrying about
     himself when he could do something to help.

     MCKAY

     (frustrated)
     The real Carson also never listened to my advice. Look, you don't
     have to prove anything, certainly not to me.

     BECKETT

     I know that. Don't worry. I'll be fine.
     (to escort)
     Let's go.

   [They head off. McKay looks very worried as he follows.]

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [Sheppard's team and Beckett warily enter, weapons at ready. McKay has
   his scanner out.]

     MCKAY
     I'm reading a bunch of life signs up ahead.

     RONON
     Well, maybe it's the Athosians.

     MCKAY
     Yeah? Or maybe it's a herd of those Frankensteins.

     SHEPPARD
     Doctor?

     BECKETT
     It's this way, I think.

   [Sheppard pauses.]

     MCKAY

     (admonishing)
     Carson.

     BECKETT
     No, no. I'm certain. It's this way.

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Michael enters with two of his followers. Teyla remains strapped to
   the table]

     TEYLA
     What is happening?

   [The two worshippers stand on either side of Teyla. Michael works with
   his equipment.]

     TEYLA
     There is a connection between us, Michael. And right now, I can
     sense your fear.

     MICHAEL
     I wouldn't go that far. Let's call it...concern.

   [Michael turns off the power. The stasis pods where all the people lie
   go dark.]

     TEYLA

     (worried)
     What did you do?

     MICHAEL
     I shut them down.

     TEYLA

     (sadly)
     You mean you killed them.

     MICHAEL
     I can't afford to leave any loose ends behind. Anyway, there's
     always more where they came from.

   [He presses a control which releases the restraints holding Teyla down.
   Before she knows it, she's being held by the two followers.]

     MICHAEL
     Take her to the ship! We're leaving.

   [They drag her away as Michael continues shutting down his equipment.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [Sheppard's group enters another room of the warehouse. It is dark and
   filled with machinery. They are hit with a barrage of gunfire. They
   take cover and return fire.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

   [From further down, the Athosians hear the firefight. Halling rushes to
   the door to try and see.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE

   [Sheppard's and Michael's men continue to exchange fire.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm starting to get tired of getting shot at with our own guns.

     BECKETT
     I'm generally not fond of it, regardless of the weapon.

   [The two followers are hit. Sheppard's team cautiously breaks cover and
   heads forward.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

     HALLING
     Hello? Is anyone there?

   INT--WAREHOUSE

     HALLING

     (from a distance)
     You must help us!

     RONON
     You hear that?

     MCKAY
     Was that Halling?

   INT--WAREHOUSE CELL

   [Sheppard's group runs down a corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Halling?

     HALLING
     Colonel! Through here!

   [The team runs down to the cell door.]

     HALLING
     Colonel Sheppard, it is very good to see you.

     SHEPPARD
     Likewise, my friend.

   [Ronon gets the door open.]

     BECKETT
     Are you all right?

     HALLING
     We're fine, those of us that are left. Teyla said you would come.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, where is she?

     HALLING
     Michael has taken her. You must go after her.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay. Take your people. We'll meet you in a little while.

   [He points the way out. Sheppard's team runs ahead. Halling herds them
   out.]

     HALLING
     Everyone, it's the time. Come. Gather your strength. Come through.
     Everyone!

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [Sheppard's group enters the empty lab. Beckett checks one of the
   people in stasis.]

     BECKETT
     My God. They're dead.

   [Ronon studies the used syringe.]

     RONON
     Sheppard?

   [Beckett and McKay stare at the equipment in horror.]

     MCKAY
     You think Teyla...?

     SHEPPARD

     (fiercely)
     No, I don't think so, and you don't think so!

   [Weapons blasts sing out around them and the four take cover again,
   exchanging fire. McKay pulls out his scanner to study it.]

     MCKAY

     (shouting to his team members around the room)
     I don't mean to rush this, but I'm picking up an energy reading.
     Someone's firing up the ship!

   [Ronon and Sheppard continue to exchange fire with the enemy, and McKay
   helps. Beckett backs away from McKay, running through a side door.]

     MCKAY
     Carson! Carson!

   [McKay continues to exchange fire.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR CATWALK

   [The two followers escort Teyla down the catwalk. They are both shot
   from behind by Beckett. Teyla turns around and looks at her rescuer in
   shock and bewilderment.]

     TEYLA
     Carson?

     BECKETT
     I know. I'm the last person you expected to see. It's all right, I'm
     here to help you.

   [He steps forward and reaches out to her, but she backs away from him.]

     TEYLA
     It's not possible.

     BECKETT
     I'm sorry. I don't have time to explain. Colonel Sheppard and the
     others are waiting back at the lab. We have to go...now!

     TEYLA
     I can't!

     CARSON
     Teyla!

     TEYLA
     Kanaan, the father of my son, he is still here. I am not leaving
     without him.

     BECKETT
     There's no time.

   [He tries to pull her away.]

     MICHAEL
     Quite correct.

   [Beckett points his Beretta at Michael, putting himself between Michael
   and Teyla.]

     MICHAEL
     You should have run when you had the chance, but you let your
     feelings get in the way.

   [Michael takes a step forward.]

     BECKETT
     Stay back, I'm warning you.

     TEYLA
     Shoot him, Carson! Shoot him now!

   [Michael smiles and continues forward.]

     MICHAEL

     (staring at Beckett)
     He doesn't want to shoot me. Or, to be more precise, he'd like
     nothing more, but, like all of my creations, he is open to my
     influence.

   [Beckett's gun arm shakes with tension.]

     TEYLA
     Carson.

   [Beckett struggles but cannot pull the trigger. The struggle is visible
   on his face.]

     BECKETT
     I'm sorry, Teyla.

   [Teyla reaches for the gun, but Michael pulls his stunner out and
   points it at her.]

     MICHAEL
     Don't!

   [She freezes, then steps back. Michael takes the pistol out of
   Beckett's grip.]

     MICHAEL
     You don't look well, Doctor. You should've stayed with me. I'd give
     you an injection, but I don't have any with me. Anyway...you've
     served your purpose.

   [Beckett glares. Michael shoots Beckett with the stunner.]

     MICHAEL
     Time to go.

   [Michael drags a sullen Teyla with him.]

   INT--MICHAEL'S LAB

   [McKay, Sheppard, and Ronon continue to shoot, but they're at a
   stalemate.]

     SHEPPARD
     Take a look at the east wall. Those look like gas containers?

   [Ronon sneaks a look.]

     RONON
     Yep. Worth a shot.

   [They fire on the containers. The tanks explode, wounding the enemy.
   One still tries to shoot, but is shot down. Sheppard looks around.]

     SHEPPARD
     Where's Beckett?

     MCKAY
     This way.

   [He points down the side corridor.]

   INT--WAREHOUSE CAT WALK

   [The trio run down the corridor, finding the two dead followers and
   Beckett lying on the floor.]

     MCKAY
     It's Carson.

   [Carson is just regaining consciousness as McKay reaches his side.]

     BECKETT
     What happened?

     MCKAY

     (annoyance masking worry)
     You ran off, that's what happened.

     BECKETT
     Teyla?

     SHEPPARD

     (anxiously)
     Did you see her?

     BECKETT

     (crestfallen)
     Oh, no.

   [A rumbling sound is heard.]

     RONON
     What the hell is that?

     MCKAY
     It's the ship.

     SHEPPARD
     Help him down.

   [He runs to the exit. McKay quickly follows.]

     RONON

     (to Sheppard)
     Yeah.
     (to Beckett)
     Come on.

   [Ronon picks Beckett up by the scruff of the neck with one hand and
   drags him with them.]

   EXT--WAREHOUSE, DAY

   [The team reach the exit just in time to see Michael's ship fly away.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard walks with Carter.]

     SHEPPARD
     We searched the place top to bottom. No sign of her.

     CARTER
     Well for now, we'll have to assume that she's still alive and that
     Michael has her.

     SHEPPARD
     We've got prisoners. They'll talk. We'll find her.

   [They enter the infirmary.]

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Keller leaves Beckett's bedside to meet them at the door. McKay stays
   by Beckett.]

     SHEPPARD
     How is he?

     KELLER
     His body's shutting down. There's nothing more I can do for him. We
     can't wait any longer.

     CARTER
     Zelenka's prepping the stasis pod.

   [Over by the bed...]

     BECKETT
     I had him in my sights. All I needed to do was pull the trigger.

     MCKAY
     It's not your fault. He made you receptive to the mind link. It's
     how he controls all of them...the hybrids.

     BECKETT
     Still, it would have been nice to make a difference.

     MCKAY
     You made a difference. We've got Michael on the run! It's just a
     matter of time before we catch up with him.

     BECKETT
     Rodney...

     MCKAY
     Look, don't say anything. Okay? It's no big deal. You're gonna go
     into the stasis pod until we...figure out how to fix you.

     BECKETT
     I'm a doctor. I know my own prognosis. Once I go into that pod,
     there's a good chance I won't come out.

   [McKay looks away, sad.]

   INT--ATLANTIS STASIS ROOM

   [McKay checks equipment nervously. Carter, Sheppard and Ronon stand
   nearby.]

     MCKAY

     (agitated)
     Right. All set.

   [Keller wheels Beckett in. She helps him out of the wheelchair.]

     KELLER

     (still embracing him around the shoulder)
     Listen...we're gonna keep working until we find a cure for this
     thing. I've got a whole team on it. Best people we have.

     BECKETT
     Thank you.

     SHEPPARD
     Either way, we're gonna get the cure, soon as we capture Michael.

   [Beckett turns to Carter. She looks at him, holding back tears.]

     BECKETT
     Samantha, there's a letter in my quarters addressed to my mother.
     Don't worry. I was careful not to give everything away. Tell her you
     found it after you shipped my things. It's just some thoughts,
     things I should have said a long time ago.

   [Carter nods.]

     CARTER

     (voice breaking)
     I'll make sure she gets it.

     BECKETT
     Thank you.

   [He walks over to Sheppard and shakes his hand.]

     SHEPPARD
     Don't you worry, Doc. We're gonna have you out of there in no time.

     BECKETT
     Colonel, you bring her home now, you understand?

     SHEPPARD
     Count on it.

   [Beckett turns to Ronon.]

     RONON

     (choked up)
     This is exactly what I was afraid of.

     BECKETT
     I know, big man. Sorry.

   [Ronon hugs Beckett and steps back. Beckett pauses by McKay who turns
   away nervously for a moment. While McKay quickly speaks, Beckett
   continues on to the stasis chamber.]

     MCKAY

     (agitated)
     Right, well you won't feel a thing--aside from a-a cool burst when
     the pod first activates. And now your, uh, life-signs will be
     monitored on this machine here, 24/7.

     BECKETT

     Thank you, Rodney.
     (to everyone)
     I want you all to know, that seeing you again, these last few days,
     it was all worth it. No matter what happens.

     MCKAY

     (nervously)
     You know, I was-was...toying with the idea of-of programming dreams
     into these things. Interested? I could have you fishing in the
     Highlands, um,...with a couple of tall, blond massage therapists?

     BECKETT

     (gently)
     Rodney...I'll be fine.

     MCKAY
     That's right, you will be. You know, 'cause this is not goodbye,
     this is, this is, uh...this is: "see ya later." That's what we
     agreed.

     BECKETT
     Did we?

     MCKAY
     That's how I remember it.

     BECKETT

     (buoyed by the optimism)
     All right, then. See you all later.

   [Beckett braces himself. McKay frowns, then activates the controls.
   Beckett freezes in the stasis. Carter sighs. They all exchange sad
   looks.]

   FADE OUT
