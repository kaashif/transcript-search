EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[A Puddle Jumper flies over the ocean.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard and Teyla are on board, Sheppard flying.]
SHEPPARD
I haven't been to the mainland in awhile. How's everybody settling
in?
TEYLA
Halling believes the first crops will have a good yield.
SHEPPARD
They still miss home?
TEYLA
There is still talk of returning, even though I've told them the
Wraith have scorched Athos bare in revenge for our resistance.
SHEPPARD
Well, maybe in time, this place will start to begin to feel like
home.
[Teyla notices something ahead.]
TEYLA
Do you see that?
[Sheppard sees it. A huge cloud formation to the right, on the
horizon.]
SHEPPARD
That can't be a storm. It stretches across the whole horizon.
TEYLA
I have never seen something like that from so high.
SHEPPARD
I've seen a lot of things from this altitude, but nothing like that.
(into radio)
Atlantis base, this is Jumper One. We're going to change our heading
to investigate a storm.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Major, this is Weir. We didn't copy that. You're breaking up.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
I said there's a... ...and it's headed right... ...little weather
forecasting.
WEIR
Did he just say "weather forecasting?"
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[The Puddle Jumper is flying above the storm, which has a huge,
hurricane-like pattern.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
TEYLA
Do all storms look like this from above?
SHEPPARD
No. This must cover twenty percent of the planet.
TEYLA
Is it headed towards the mainland?
SHEPPARD
Tracking right toward the settlement.
TEYLA
And after that?
SHEPPARD
(worried)
Straight to Atlantis.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[McKay briefs the team, Zelenka, and Weir.]
MCKAY
This planet is basically the same size as Earth. Now, hurricanes on
Earth never get as big as this bad boy because once they hit the
shore, the brakes get put on. But without as much land mass to slow
it down here, it's just gaining momentum.
ZELENKA
Yeah, both of them are.
MCKAY
Yes.
WEIR
Both of them?
TEYLA
We saw only one.
MCKAY
It only looked like one. Now, according to the ancient database,
every twenty or thirty years, the sea gets unseasonably warm. Now,
that, for reasons too boring to get into, means that hurricanes are
much more likely to occur.
ZELENKA
Well, like El Nino the ocean is--
MCKAY
(dismissively)
Like I said, too boring to go into.
WEIR
Focus.
MCKAY
Look, basically, if you have a situation where there are a bunch of
hurricanes out there, the likelihood of two colliding is greatly
increased. That's what's happening.
ZELENKA
It's more like a merger than a collision. They are intersecting and
combining their power.
MCKAY
And? It's headed right towards us.
WEIR
You just said the Ancients experienced these storms every twenty to
thirty years. Atlantis must have some sort of precautions put in
place.
MCKAY
In the past, the Ancients have been protected by the shield, or
submerged deep enough in the water not be affected.
SHEPPARD
Okay strike those options. What else have we got?
ZELENKA
Nothing. It is a real threat; the high winds alone will wreak havoc.
SHEPPARD
Come on, guys, I mean, this city's been around for a long time.
ZELENKA
A storm surge is inevitable.
MCKAY
Not to mention the fact that by moving over a land mass just before
hitting us, the likelihood of tornadoes and electrical activity is
greatly increased.
[Weir wipes her brow in dismay.]
SHEPPARD
This is Atlantis. I mean, we've got to be able to handle
that...Right?
MCKAY
No.
WEIR
Why not?
MCKAY
The people who built this city knew they had a force field capable
of holding back anything mother nature, or, for that matter, the
Wraith could throw at them. Without that protection, Atlantis is
remarkably fragile.
ZELENKA
Even our conservative calculations project widespread structural
damage.
MCKAY
Flooding could sink the city entirely.
FORD
How could something as big as Atlantis just sink?
SHEPPARD
I'm sure the passengers on the Titanic were asking themselves the
same question.
MCKAY
Yes, well, let's not.
SHEPPARD
So, what you're saying is if Teyla and I hadn't discovered this,
we--
WEIR
We would be in even bigger trouble. All right, what's the plan?
MCKAY
By my calculations, we have just under twelve hours until the storm
hits, so, uh... We plan to have a plan...
ZELENKA
Yeah.
MCKAY
By then.
[Weir is incredulous; everyone else concerned.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[Weir and Sheppard enter, talking.]
WEIR
We start investigating evacuation plans, both on the mainland, and
off-world somewhere.
SHEPPARD
You know McKay will come up with something. He's just setting
himself up to be a hero.
WEIR
Yeah, well, maybe Rodney is, but Dr. Zelenka, he seemed genuinely
concerned.
SHEPPARD
So, my orders are to come up with a friendly planet that wouldn't
mind putting us up for the night.
WEIR
Exactly. Take Ford, see what you can work out.
[He leaves; she sits at her desk and sighs, about to open her laptop.]
EXT--MAINLAND ON ATLANTIS PLANET, DAY
[Athosians are working to build tents using primitive tools; there is
at least one Atlantis-built tent.]
BECKETT
(approaching Teyla, holding a rope and bag of supplies)
I don't really have the right boots for this. I was just meant to
come out here and inoculate some wee babies.
TEYLA
We need all the hands we can spare before it comes. This storm could
not only destroy our crops, our settlement could be washed away. If
just a few of us were to remain--
BECKETT
Crops can be replaced and homes rebuilt. People can't.
TEYLA
Which is why we must do what we can now.
[She throws him a coil of rope.]
BECKETT
Right.
EXT--WORMHOLE TRAVEL
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM ON MANARA
[Ford and Sheppard speak to the leader of the Manarians.]
SMEADON
The entire population of Atlantis?
SHEPPARD
At most, yes.
FORD
Only for a day. Two at most.
SMEADON
We are happy to trade with you for a share of our crops... But this.
SHEPPARD
I know it's a lot to ask, but... I'm asking.
SMEADON
What do you offer in return?
SHEPPARD
I guess we'd owe you one.
SMEADON
One what?
SHEPPARD
A favor.
[Smeadon looks at one of his men in confusion.]
SHEPPARD
Look, we're in trouble. If you're our friend, you'll help. If not,
tell me now so I can ask somebody else.
SMEADON
But who else would take in so many? I want something of value in
return.
SHEPPARD
Oh, you do, do you? You know, we can go find any uninhabited planet.
SMEADON
(slyly)
They're usually uninhabited for good reason, Major and you know that
as well as I do, or you would not be here. Still, I'm sure you could
find another world to take you in... You're just so short on time.
SHEPPARD
One day you're going to run across a problem and you're going to
need our help. Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
FORD
Yes, sir. We've got lots of ships and weapons we can...help with.
[He puts his gun on the table.]
SMEADON
You're telling me we can either be your friends or--
SHEPPARD
I much prefer friends. That is of value to me.
[He stands up.]
SHEPPARD
One night, two tops. We'll bring our own blankets.
SMEADON
(smugly)
Very well. You may send your people.
SHEPPARD
This won't be forgotten. I'll go back and tell everybody the good
news. I'll send word once we know more.
SMEADON
I look forward to it.
[Sheppard and Ford leave.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[McKay, Zelenka, and other scientists work hurriedly on laptops.]
MCKAY
No, no, no, no, no, I've already thought of that.
ZELENKA
He may be onto something.
MCKAY
I've already thought of it! It doesn't-- Yes, the naquadah
generators could be used to power select sections of the city, but
when you subtract the areas that need to be secured just to protect
themselves, it doesn't leave much power to shield anything else, and
the city breaks apart because of the tidal stresses.
ZELENKA
Well, we could relocate some of them, put them closer together.
MCKAY
(loudly sarcastic)
You're right. If only we had a magical tool that could slow down
time. I foolishly left mine on Earth. Did you bring yours?
ZELENKA
You know...you're not pleasant when you're like this, McKay.
MCKAY
I'm always like this.
ZELENKA
My point exactly.
[Sheppard and Ford enter.]
SHEPPARD
Well, I've got a green light from Smeadon and the Manarians. I'm not
sure how pleased he'll be if we get stuck there, though. That's not
going to happen, right?
MCKAY
Of course it's not. We can always gate off to another planet.
SHEPPARD
Comforting. Thank you.
FORD
Are we sure there's no part of the mainland we could go to?
TEYLA
Everywhere that we have explored is in the path of the storm. My
people are evacuating even now.
SHEPPARD
Still, Ford's right. The mainland's the size of North America.
You're telling me the entire continent's going to get hit? 'Cause
I'd rather not owe Smeadon any favors.
WEIR
If we lose Atlantis, we'll be stuck on the mainland without any
access to the Stargate.
SHEPPARD
McKay will come up with something.
MCKAY
I will try, but despite what you all may think, I am not Superman.
[Ford chuckles.]
SHEPPARD
Was anyone seriously thinking that?
FORD
No, sir.
ZELENKA
Never.
MCKAY
Fine. My point is the storm will affect over seventy percent of the
mainland and Atlantis isn't safe either. If you want everyone to
live, you gate them off-world.
INT--MANARAN CONFERENCE ROOM
[Smeadon pulls a device from a drawer. It is a communications device.]
SMEADON
(into device)
Relay station two, prepare to receive transmission.
VOICE
(over device)
R.S.2 awaiting transmission. Over.
SMEADON
I need you to relay a message to Cowen, of the Genii. Tell him we
have something to trade.
[He smiles slyly.]
EXT--MAINLAND, DAY
[Ford stands outside a Puddle Jumper. Teyla users Athosians into the
ship. Another ship sits nearby, also being loaded.]
FORD
This could be going faster.
TEYLA
Our people are hunters, Lieutenant. Many returning from great
distances. Others do not want to leave the settlement.
FORD
They know how serious this is.
TEYLA
Even I would have a hard time believing in the strength of this
coming storm if I did not see it from space.
FORD
Yeah, well, do what you can to speed things up.
[Teyla nods.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[McKay and Zelenka work.]
ZELENKA
In the Czech Republic, we don't have to deal with hurricanes.
MCKAY
We don't get that many in Canada either. Once something called
"Hazel."
ZELENKA
Hazel?
MCKAY
Forty years ago.
ZELENKA
That's interesting.
MCKAY
Not really.
ZELENKA
No, not really.
MCKAY
I was once almost struck by lightning.
ZELENKA
(becoming inspired)
Lightning?
[McKay realizes the same thing and stands.]
INT--GATE CONTROL ROOM
[McKay and Zelenka rush in to speak to Weir. McKay nudges Zelenka aside
so he can explain first.]
MCKAY
What is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?
WEIR
That would--
MCKAY
Power. And what does a mega-storm from hell have lots of?
WEIR
Power.
MCKAY
In the form of?
WEIR
You want to build a windmill?
MCKAY
Electricity!
ZELENKA
Atlantis is designed to withstand substantial lightning strikes.
There are lightning rods all over the city.
MCKAY
All those rods are channeled into four main grounding stations.
ZELENKA
Yeah, in turn, those grounding stations discharge electricity back
into the ocean, keeping Atlantis safe from massive electric shocks
due to lightning strikes.
MCKAY
Now, many of the hallways are lined with a superconductive material
that allows a safe, low-voltage transfer of power throughout the
city.
ZELENKA
Yeah. Which, of course means--
MCKAY
I'm getting there, I'm getting there. Let's say the grounding
stations weren't around. Every time lightning struck the city, those
halls would become supercharged.
WEIR
So wait, you want--
MCKAY
If we were able to disable the grounding stations...
ZELENKA
Which we think we can.
MCKAY
Every time lightning struck the city, Atlantis would experience a
momentary massive power surge. Now, that energy--
ZELENKA
If it's channeled correctly, though--
MCKAY
Yes, of course if channeled correctly-- could conceivably be used to
charge up the shield generator. Now, the more severe the storm, the
more energy is produced and the longer we can keep the shield
running.
ZELENKA
It's an ingenious plan, really.
MCKAY
I'm compelled to agree.
[Before Weir even has a chance to react, they start talking excitedly
to each other.]
ZELENKA
The only downside is we have no way of storing all that energy.
MCKAY
Ah, once the storm stops and the lightning stops striking...
ZELENKA
Yeah, we have no way of charging up the generator.
MCKAY
Then we're back to square one.
WEIR
So the city would survive?
MCKAY
I'd give us better than ninety percent--
ZELENKA
Seventy.
MCKAY
Eighty percent chance.
WEIR
Okay, so we should still evacuate.
MCKAY
Yes, but not just because of Zelemka's pessimism.
ZELENKA
Zelenka. If the plan works, the city will become highly charged with
electricity. Really, the only safe place to be once the lightning
begins to strike is in the control room.
MCKAY
Mm. We need to evacuate everyone off-world until the storm passes
and execute the plan with the smallest team possible.
WEIR
Okay, good. Get on it.
[They turn to leave, still talking.]
MCKAY
Right. To the grounding stations.
ZELENKA
No, I think we should go to the power distribution centers first.
MCKAY
Ah, good point, good call. Okay. I tend to get ahead of myself.
ZELENKA
Yeah. Okay, so...
INT--GENII HIDDEN COMPOUND
INT--GENII TRAINING ROOM
[Kolya takes on three Genii soldiers armed with fighting sticks. He
takes the two men down quickly, then spars with the female. He ends by
trapping her hand painfully then throwing her to the ground. A private
enters.]
GENII PRIVATE
Commander Kolya... Chief Cowen needs to see you immediately.
KOLYA
I'm not to be disturbed while training.
GENII PRIVATE
He said "immediately," sir.
[Kolya reluctantly tosses away his stick, then helps the female soldier
up.]
EXT--ATLANTIS MAINLAND, DAY
[The wind is starting to kick up strongly. Teyla, Beckett, and Ford
wait by the Puddle Jumper.]
FORD
Still haven't turned up yet?
TEYLA
I'm afraid not. They are on a hunting mission. No one has been able
to get them word about the evacuation.
FORD
How many again?
TEYLA
Three. Two boys and a young woman.
BECKETT
Why don't we just take our jumper and go find them?
TEYLA
They are hunting in dense vegetation. Even if we were able to locate
them, we would be unable to land.
BECKETT
Jumper Three is loaded and ready to go. Maybe you should just--
TEYLA
Just go. I will stay behind and give the hunters more time.
FORD
I'll stay with you.
BECKETT
Okay, I get the point. We'll wait.
INT--COWEN'S OFFICE
[Kolya has come as ordered.]
KOLYA
They're not ready.
COWEN
Of course they are.
KOLYA
You commissioned me to train a group of men who, on their most
treacherous day, guarded this facility or performed some sort of
reconnaissance mission. They are not yet a strike force.
COWEN
This is the rarest of opportunities. Within the next hour, there
will be less than ten people on Atlantis, most of them only
scientists. Now, surely you can accomplish our goals and get out
before the storm hits.
KOLYA
If all goes well. But we don't train assuming all will go well.
COWEN
We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.
KOLYA
You wanted my opinion. I gave it to you.
COWEN
(calm by intent)
And I value that opinion... But the Atlantians are in possession of
materials that are vital to our goal of defeating the Wraith. We
need them. I need them. Ready your strike force.
[Kolya leaves without saying a word.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The gate is active; Atlantis personnel head through carrying supplies.
The gate shuts down.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE CONTROL ROOM
[McKay, Weir, and Sheppard have watched the evacuation.]
MCKAY
That's everybody. We've got just over four and a half hours until
the storm hits. Let's get down to the labs.
[He and Weir leave. Two security guards approach Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
Evacuate the people on in-bound Jumper Two as soon as they come in.
GUARD #1
Yes, sir.
INT--MANARAN CONFERENCE ROOM
[Smeadon drinks with an Athosian farmer, who is very intoxicated.]
DORAN
I'm finally at the point where I don't mind the taste of it.
SMEADON
I was raised on this brew. It burned away whatever taste sense I
had. So, you think you can teach our farmers a thing or two?
DORAN
(drunkenly)
Yes, yes, that's what I was saying, yes. Most people think that
farming is planting good seed in well-tilled soil, which it is. It
is, but there's also more, and that knowledge is here.
[As he speaks, the Genii romany Sora walks up behind him.]
SMEADON
And you want to trade these marvelous skills in an exchange for a
piece of my land.
DORAN
I do.
SMEADON
I think I'll need something more.
[Sora grabs Doran's finger and twists it, making him yelp.]
DORAN
Ow ow ow.
[Smeadon pulls a device from Doran's vest pocket.]
DORAN
That hurt. Who are you?
[Kolya is there now as well.]
KOLYA
Tell me the sequence of numbers to enter in this device.
DORAN
I can't tell you that.
[Sora tightens her hold around his neck.]
SORA
It isn't worth dying for.
DORAN
You don't understand. It's my hand that you need to put in the code.
That's how it works.
KOYLA
And the shield of the Atlantis Stargate will be lowered?
DORAN
Yes, yes. What is this? Who are they?
KOYLA
Bring him to the gate.
SMEADON
They are friends, Doran.
KOYLA
Make sure he will enter the code.
SORA
He will.
SMEADON
Do as they say, and we'll see about that piece of land.
[Sora and Doran leave.]
KOYLA
(to Smeadon)
You have done a great service for the Genii and will be rewarded.
[Kolya leaves, holding the device. Smeadon smiles smugly.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay works at a computer while Sheppard and Weir look on.]
MCKAY
There are dozens, possibly hundreds of lightning rods placed
strategically around the city.
SHEPPARD
Wait a sec.
MCKAY
What?
SHEPPARD
Why?
MCKAY
Why what?
SHEPPARD
Why are there hundreds of lightning rods placed around the city?
Wouldn't the shield protect against lightning?
MCKAY
Yes, yes, it would but running the shield all the time is only good
for one thing...draining power.
SHEPPARD
Right?
MCKAY
You're aware that there is a time element to what we're doing here,
right?
SHEPPARD
Yes it's been brought to my attention.
MCKAY
Like I was saying, there are lightning rods, a lot of them, placed
all over the city. Now, as it stands right now, all the energy they
capture is routed into four main grounding stations. In turn, these
stations ground all that energy into the ocean below us.
SHEPPARD
So instead of sending electricity to ground...
MCKAY
We use it to power the shield.
WEIR
How?
MCKAY
By directing it right down the corridors of Atlantis and into the
shield generators.
WEIR
The city can handle that?
MCKAY
Yes...theoretically.
SHEPPARD
Like dinosaurs turned into birds "theoretically," or theory of
relativity "theoretically?"
MCKAY
What? Uh...somewhere between. Elizabeth...you take grounding station
two; I'll take grounding station one. Major, you take stations three
and four.
SHEPPARD
Whoa, whoa, wait a sec, where are stations three and four?
MCKAY
(indicating on a map)
Here and here.
SHEPPARD
And we are...
[McKay has chosen nearer stations for himself and Weir.]
MCKAY
Here, yes. I need to get done quickly so I can start working on the
sub-routines, and Elizabeth was complaining about her knee the other
day, so--
SHEPPARD
Whoa, wait a second. Are these things even close to a transporter?
MCKAY
Uh, yes, Elizabeth's is.
SHEPPARD
(probing)
And mine?
MCKAY
(cagily)
It's a brisk walk away.
SHEPPARD
And by brisk you mean far?
MCKAY
By walk I mean run.
SHEPPARD
Okay.
MCKAY
You'll need to radio in once you've gotten to your first station.
SHEPPARD
All right, let's do it.
EXT--MAINLAND ON ATLANTIS PLANET, DAY
[It is now a deluge around the Puddle Jumper. Teyla waits outside.
Finally the missing hunters emerge jogging out of the woods. They all
rush into the Jumper.]
TEYLA
Hurry! Move! Come this way! Hurry!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The hunters take seats on the benches.]
FORD
Are you okay? You okay?
BECKETT
Here it comes.
FORD
Okay, just sit here. Strap in as best you can. It's going to be a
real bumpy ride.
(joining Beckett, who is at the pilot controls)
All right, let's get out of here.
BECKETT
I'm not so certain that's such a good idea anymore.
FORD
What?
BECKETT
Look at it out there. Even Major Sheppard would have a hard time
flying through this.
TEYLA
(joining them)
We are ready.
BECKETT
I think it's best if we wait it out. We're safe as long as we're in
here. We've got rations, and there's plenty of water.
FORD
Yeah, especially outside.
[They all look at each other doubtfully.]
TEYLA
Very well. I hope you are right, Doctor. We won't have a chance to
change our minds if you are wrong.
BECKETT
It'll be cozy.
[Outside, the thunder claps.]
EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION
[Sheppard arrives at his first station. The wind is blowing strongly.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I'm here!
MCKAY
(over radio)
I told you to contact me when you got to the first one, Major.
SHEPPARD
I am at the first one, Rodney.
INT--ATLANTIS STAIRWAY
MCKAY
Oh, sorry, I'm already done mine.
EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION

SHEPPARD
Good for everyone.

SHEPPARD
I'm at the damn grounding station.
MCKAY
No, no, no, no, not you.
WEIR
I'm in the transporter.
INT--AT ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER
[Weir exits to find McKay there.]
MCKAY
There you are.
WEIR
There I am.
[They start walking together.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Glad everybody's having such a good time. What do I do?
MCKAY
There should be a keypad right on the console of the station.
[The scene switches between McKay and Weir walking inside and Sheppard
at the grounding station.]
SHEPPARD
(finding it)
Got it.
MCKAY
Punch in the Ancient equivalent of 0-3-1--5-4-7.
[Sheppard turns a dial to the numbers indicated.]
MCKAY
That do it?
[The grounding station separates from the section that goes under the
sea.]
SHEPPARD
Yep.
MCKAY
Good, three down, one to go. They all seem to have the same
separation code, so, uh, get to the next one, repeat the procedure,
we'll meet you in the control room.
SHEPPARD
(running back inside)
Roger that.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The two guards keep casual watch over the inactive gate.]
GUARD #1
Bacon.
GUARD #2
The one thing you wish you'd brought with you is bacon?
GUARD #1
It's the food that makes other food worth eating.
GUARD #2
You wish you brought bacon to another galaxy?
GUARD #1
Yeah, you asked me what--
[The gate starts to spin.]
GUARD #1
Off-world activation.
GUARD #2
Dr. Weir said no one should be coming back until tomorrow.
SORA
(by voice from other side of wormhole)
There's been an attack on Manara. We have wounded incoming! Lower
the shield.
GUARD #2
They're broadcasting an Athosian IDC.
SORA
Please! Before it's too late.
GUARD #2
We are lowering the shield.
GUARD #1
Whoa, we should get the okay from Dr. Weir.
GUARD #2
They're under attack. Lower the shield.
GUARD #1
(into radio)
Dr. Weir there's been some sort of attack on Manara. We have an
Athosian party incoming with wounded.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
WEIR
(into radio)
We're on our way.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[People dressed as Athosians pour through the gate. Some carry a
stretcher with a covered body. The guards run down the stairs to meet
them.]
GUARD #1
What happened?
SORA
They were everywhere! I can't believe they didn't kill us all.
GUARD #2
Who?
[Kolya uncovers himself, jumps off the stretcher, and shoots both
guards. The other shed their Athosian cloaks to reveal Genii uniforms.]
SOLDIER
All right, check your weapons.
[A man checks the guards and finds them both dead.]
KOLYA
(casually)
Secure the room.
SORA
(to Kolya)
These men could have been overpowered. We need the Atlantians to be
cooperative.
KOLYA
Secure the room.
SORA
Cover the entrances!
[The soldiers run up the stairs to get in position. Kolya looks around
from the staircase.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard runs.]
WEIR
(over radio)
Apparently there's wounded incoming.
SHEPPARD
That doesn't make any sense. They said it was Wraith-related?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir and McKay make their way toward the gate room.]
WEIR
(into radio)
We'll ask them ourselves in a second. Hold on.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[McKay and Weir arrive in the gate room and are immediately seized by
the Genii soldiers. The rest point their weapons at them.]
WEIR
What the hell is going on?
KOLYA
Dr. Elizabeth Weir?
WEIR
Yes.
KOLYA
And you must be Dr. McKay.
SORA
That is him.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

Where is Major Sheppard? I would like to know the whereabouts of
Major Sheppard.
[Sheppard stops running to listen.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
WEIR
You seem to know a lot about us. Who are you?
MCKAY
They're Genii.
KOLYA
There's only one thing you need to know, Dr. Weir. As of right
now...we are in control of Atlantis.
[Weir and McKay look at each other in shock. Sheppard is shocked as
well.]

FORD
This is Ford, sir. We decided to wait out the storm in the Jumper.

You're still on the mainland?
FORD
(into radio)
Yes, sir.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Well, we've got a situation, here. From what I can ascertain, a
small Genii strike force has gated in.
FORD
(into radio)
The Genii? The folks who wanted us to build them an A-bomb?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Yeah, that's them. They've got Weir and McKay hostage. They've also
got control of the gate room.
FORD
(into radio)
You're breaking up, sir, did you say hostage?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Affirmative.
[Beckett groans in dismay.]
FORD
(into radio)
We're on our way.
BECKETT
What do you think you're doing?
FORD
You heard him.
BECKETT
Take a look outside, hotshot. We're not flying through this.
FORD
McKay and Weir were taken hostage, Doc. I'm not just going to sit
here and do nothing.
BECKETT
Neither one of us are real pilots. If it was a bad idea an hour ago,
it's an idiotic one now.
FORD
We're going to have to take our chances.
TEYLA
Dr. Beckett is right, Lieutenant. We are of no use to Major Sheppard
dead.
(into radio)
Major, this is Teyla. The hurricane is in full force outside. We
could attempt to fly through it, but it is doubtful that we would
make it back to Atlantis. And we have three young passengers.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
That's bad news.
TEYLA
(into radio)
I am sorry.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
So am I. You stay put until it passes over.
FORD
(into radio)
Sir, I--
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
It's okay, Lieutenant. Just get your ass back here as soon as you
can. I could use a little backup.
FORD
(into radio)
Good luck, sir.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Sheppard out.
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY
[Kolya surveys the weather, then heads back inside.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir and McKay are held at gun-point. A Genii soldier, Ladon, removes
McKay's radio headset.]
WEIR
Who are you?
KOLYA
Commander Acastus Kolya, of the Genii.
(looking around the control room)
This Atlantis is extraordinary...more than I ever imagined.
WEIR
What have you done with the rest of my people?
KOLYA
I'm quite sure they have no idea we're even here.
WEIR
Then they're safe?
KOLYA
Yes.
WEIR
How were you able to bypass the shield?
KOLYA
With the time-tested combination of strong drink and weak minds.
WEIR
There was a time when our two peoples considered becoming allies.
Why are you doing this?
KOLYA
You are in possession of supplies we vitally need. Hand them over
without difficulty, and we'll leave peacefully.
WEIR
Or?
KOLYA
We're both intelligent people, Dr. Weir. I'm sure there's no need
for me to demonstrate once again the strength of my resolve.
WEIR
Which supplies did you have in mind?
KOLYA
All of your stores of the C4 explosive. All of your medical
supplies. The Wraith Data Device you stole from my people... And one
of your ships.
MCKAY
(sarcastically)
Is that all?
KOLYA
No. Where is Major Sheppard?
WEIR
He's on the mainland. What you're asking for isn't that easy. We've
had to divert a lot of power in order to prepare for the storm. The
armory safety doors have shut, which means we can't--
KOLYA
Just so we're clear, I know you're lying.
MCKAY
Elizabeth, just give him what he needs.
[McKay leans forward, pressing a button on the console to activate the
intercomm.]
MCKAY
If he needs the C4, the medical supplies, and the Wraith Data
Device, then just give it to him. None of that's worth dying for.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, now suited in combat gear and fully armed, overhears McKay.
The Genii notice that McKay is touching the console.]
KOLYA
Step away from the console.
MCKAY
I was leaning! I was just leaning!
WEIR
Your request is unreasonable. And, you can't possibly need all our
C4, or all our medical supplies.
KOLYA
You're in no position to tell me what is reasonable and what is not.
WEIR
How do we know that you won't kill us once we give you what you
need?
KOLYA
You don't. Please show my men where they can find what they're
looking for.
[Sora, Ladon and another soldier lead Weir away.]
KOLYA
What are you doing here?
MCKAY
(defiantly)
From my understanding, I'm being held hostage.
KOLYA
I mean here, in Atlantis. Why did some of you stay behind?
MCKAY
Oh. Tie up some loose ends.
KOLYA
Like what?
MCKAY
You know. Make sure everyone got out okay.
KOLYA
Isn't that the work of someone less important?
MCKAY
(chucking nervously)
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
KOLYA
You have a plan, don't you?
MCKAY
I've got lots of plans about lots of things.
KOLYA
I'm interested in the plan you have to save the city.
MCKAY
I never said anything about saving anything.
KOLYA
Not yet.
[He puts his hand on McKay's shoulder threateningly. He nods to a
soldier, who pulls out a long, sharp knife.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Genii soldiers collect infirmary supplies by the boxful.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Weir pulls out a box from beneath a table and works to open it.]
SORA
(with hostility)
Where is Teyla Emmagan?
WEIR
You know Teyla?
SORA
Is she here, in the city?
WEIR
No, she isn't. You must be Sora. I read the Genii mission report.
I'm sorry about your father.
SORA
He'll be avenged.
WEIR
Teyla didn't kill him.
SORA
No. She left him to die.
WEIR
She had no choice--
SORA
Are you finished?
WEIR
All of the information we downloaded from the Wraith ship is still
on this device.
[She shows it to them.]
INT--ATLANTIS ARMORY
[Two soldiers enter. In an empty C4 box, they find a radio. It's marked
with an arrow to a button and the word "Talk".]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The soldier arrives with the radio and gives it to Kolya. Sora is
there as well.]
[Nearby, Weir is holding McKay's forearm, which is bleeding through his
jacket.]
WEIR
What did they do to you?
MCKAY
I tried to keep my mouth shut. I tried, I just, I couldn't...
[Kolya approaches.]
KOLYA
What's the meaning of this?
WEIR
I honestly have no idea.
MCKAY
It's a radio. The arrow points to the talk button.
KOLYA
(into radio)
This is Commander Kolya.
INT--ATLANTIS UPPER WALKWAY
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Kolya... That's a hard name to pronounce. Is that a first name? My
name's Major John Sheppard, and I have hidden the C4 where you will
never, I repeat, never, find it. When I get confirmation that the
prisoners have been safely released and allowed to gate off
Atlantis, I will help you find it.
KOLYA
He's good.
WEIR
Yes, he is. I'd do what he says.
[The scene switches between Sheppard and Kolya's locations.]
KOLYA
(into radio)
Your offer is very generous, Major.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Yes, it is.
KOLYA
(into radio)
However, Dr. McKay recently shared with me there's a plan in action
to save the city.
SHEPPARD
(surprised, into radio)
He did?
KOLYA
(into radio)
He did. My understanding is there is one final grounding station
that needs to be deactivated. Uncouple the grounding rods at station
three, assist with the reactivation of the shield, and you and your
friends can leave here, unharmed.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Wait a minute. I thought all you wanted was C4 and a Jumper.
KOLYA
(into radio)
Why raid a city when you can seize it, Major? Atlantis will be ours
or the ocean's... You choose.
EXT--ATLANTIS MAINLAND, DAY
[The weather has degraded further.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
We should have heard something from the Major by now.
TEYLA
Perhaps he has not had the opportunity.
FORD
I don't like not knowing what's going on in there.
BECKETT
Why would the Genii attack us? Why now?
FORD
We didn't exactly leave on the best terms. I mean, beside from the
fact that we stole some of their gear and didn't hand over the C4 we
promised them, they're pretty convinced Teyla killed one of their
top guys.
TEYLA
They believe so falsely. The fact that they chose our weakest hour
cannot be a coincidence. Someone must have told them that we would
be in a diminished capacity.
FORD
There's got to be a way back.
BECKETT
Those winds outside are blowing at a hundred and ten knots. We're
not going anywhere, son.
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Sora leads Weir in. Kolya is working a tablet computer.]
WEIR
Thank you for seeing me. This city was designed to be inhabited by
the Ancients and their direct descendants and although, yes, while
there is limited functionality for those who do not posses the
Ancient gene, it is only those who have it who can revive this city
to its true potential.
KOLYA
And you have this gene?
WEIR
No, but many of my team do. The Wraith are slowly waking. Soon this
entire galaxy will be embroiled in a war the likes of which our
generations have never seen.
KOLYA
A war that you expedited.
WEIR
Disagreements like ours will no longer matter. The only thing of any
consequence will be how prepared we are, and what defense we are
able to mount. Now, this city holds many secrets which could help us
win that war... But only if my team are here to discover them. So
fine, take whatever you need for your people, but if you don't leave
us this city, you're only hurting yourselves in the long run.
KOLYA
You believe your people, who are not even of this galaxy, are closer
to the Ancients than we are? Your arrogance is astounding. We will
take this city, we will mount a defense, and we will win, with or
without your help, Dr. Weir.
[The soldier who had the knife arrives.]
GENII PRIVATE
Sir, he's at the Grounding Station.
[Kolya grabs the radio and gets up.]
EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY
[Sheppard arrives. The weather is much worse now. Sheppard holds up a
life-signs detector.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Kolya arrives. Ladon is speaking into a Genii radio.]
LADON
The commander's here.
SOLDIER
(over radio)
He's just standing there, sir.
KOLYA
Hold your position. Do not approach until he's finished.
SOLDIER
(over radio)
Yes, sir.
KOLYA
Use lethal force only if necessary.
SORA
(concerned)
You told him he would be unharmed.
KOLYA
Let's hope he doesn't put up much of a fight.
EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY
[Sheppard sees the other soldiers on the life-signs detector. He makes
his way around the device and then to the wall where he has some cover.
He has his rifle raised.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SOLDIER
(over radio)
He's stopped. He's not at the control panel anymore. He's looking
around.
KOLYA
(into radio)
Hold your fire.
MCKAY
Those control panels are pretty fragile. You might not want to--
[A Genii soldier grabs McKay on his injured arm.]
MCKAY
Oh!
EXT--ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY
[Sheppard works his way out of sight of the two soldiers. They move
forward to find him. He shoots one multiple times. The other pursues
him, and he dives over the railing onto the balcony. He shoots the
second soldier, killing him. He takes his radio from the soldier's
wrist. He sees that the control switch has been hit and is ruined. He
speaks into the radio.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Let me tell you what you did wrong here, Kolya.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay gasps in relief to hear Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
A), you lost two of your men. B), You damaged the switch before I
could separate the grounding rods, which I'm sure you're gonna get
an earful from McKay for... and, C), you lost all of what little
credibility you had with me.
MCKAY
Do you have any idea how big a setback that is? I may not even be
able to activate the shield. I can't possibly--
[A soldier grabs his arm again.]
MCKAY
Get off me!
[The scene switches between Sheppard and Kolya's locations.]
KOLYA
You killed two of my men.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I guess we're even.
KOLYA
(into radio)
I don't like even.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I'm not finished yet.
KOLYA
(into radio)
Neither am I. Say goodbye to Dr. Weir.
[Kolya points his gun at Weir. McKay is stricken, and Weir tries to
steel herself.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio, shouting in anger)
This city has a self-destruct button. If you hurt her, I'll activate
it. Nobody'll get Atlantis!
KOLYA
Even if it exists, Major, you need at least two senior personnel to
activate it... And I'm about to take one of them out of the
equation.
SHEPPARD
(into radio, shouting for a response)
Kolya? Kolya! I'll give you a ship! I'll fly it out of here for you
myself! Kolya!
[Darkness falls as the storm approaches.]
FADE OUT
