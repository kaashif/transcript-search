   TEASER

   EXT--FOREST, DAY

   [Ronon and Teyla are carrying baskets laden with fruit and vegetables
   as they walk through the forest.]

     RONON
     You getting any sleep these days?

     TEYLA
     Not much, I'm afraid. Although things are a little easier now that
     Kanaan's request has been granted and he's been allowed to return
     from the mainland.

     RONON
     How's he liking life in the big city?

     TEYLA
     Well, he's happy to be reunited with Torren and I, but...he's having
     difficulty adjusting to life on Atlantis.

     RONON

     (chuckling)
     Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.

     TEYLA
     And you once stunned Doctor Gero at your own surprise birthday
     party.

     RONON

     (unamused)
     He spooked me.

     TEYLA
     Uh-huh. It's difficult for Kanaan. He has Torren and me, of course,
     but I still think he feels isolated.

     RONON
     Yeah, well, he just needs to make some new friends. You should get
     him to come by the gym sometime. We could spar.

     TEYLA

     (laughing)
     Thank you, that's very kind of you. But I need him one piece for the
     foreseeable future.

     RONON

     (teasing)
     Ah, you're no fun.

   [Teyla laughs. Ronon spots a person lying in the grass in the
   distance.]

     RONON

     (alert)
     Hey, hey.

   [Teyla drops her basket and follows Ronon, who's approaching the hooded
   figure.]

     RONON

     (calling out)
     Hey!

   [He moves forward, setting off a hidden mine which explodes in smoke.
   Disoriented, Ronon is slow to react as the robed figure raises his own
   stunner weapon and fires. Ronon gets struck several times, finally
   collapsing.]

     TEYLA
     Ronon!

   [The figure removes his hood, revealing his features.]

     TEYLA
     Tyre.

   [Tyre aims his stunner at Teyla and fires.]

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Woolsey, Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay sit around the table.]

     WOOLSEY
     The Daedalus confirms the results of your preliminary search.
     There's no sign of Ronon's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that
     planet.

     SHEPPARD
     That means he's still alive. If-if Tyre wanted him dead, we would've
     found the body.

     WOOLSEY
     Unless he just took him somewhere to exact a slow revenge... I don't
     mean to sound overly negative, but from what I've heard, his mind is
     seriously warped.

     TEYLA
     And yet, he didn't kill me. It would've been safer for him to leave
     no witnesses. So...perhaps despite what the Wraith did to him, Tyre
     still possesses his Satedan sense of honor.

     MCKAY
     It didn't stop him from ambushing you.

     SHEPPARD

     (inspired)
     Maybe we can use that "Satedan sense of honor" to help us find
     Ronon.

     WOOLSEY
     How do you propose to do that?

     SHEPPARD
     We get a Satedan to help us.

     MCKAY

     (drily)
     You happen to have one handy, do you?

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla knows where one is.

     TEYLA

     (realizing)
     Solen Sincha.

     WOOLSEY
     Who?

     TEYLA
     He is a survivor of the Wraith attack on Sateda. Ronon and I
     encountered him on a trade mission to Belkan two years ago.

     MCKAY
     Judging by your description, he isn't exactly the "settle-down" kind
     of guy. I mean, what are the chances he's still going to be there?

     SHEPPARD
     There's only one way to find out.

   [They start to leave. A still seated Woolsey clears his throat loudly.
   Everyone pauses. Sheppard sighs.]

     SHEPPARD

     (with exaggerated patiently)
     Mister Woolsey, permission to go off-world?

   [Woolsey takes his time, closing a file and sighing.]

     WOOLSEY
     You have a go.

     SHEPPARD
     Great.

   [They turn to leave.]

     WOOLSEY
     Oh, and Teyla...

   [They turn again.]

     WOOLSEY
     Will you be accompanying Colonel Sheppard and Doctor McKay? I only
     ask because I've yet to receive your formal request to return to
     active duty.

   [Teyla looks uncomfortable.]

     SHEPPARD
     Of course, she'll be returning, right?

   [He looks at Teyla expectantly.]

     TEYLA

     (sighing)
     I have yet to make a decision about my future with the team.

     SHEPPARD

     (nonplussed)
     Oh. Well, okay.

   [He exchanges concerned looks with McKay.]

     TEYLA

     (turning to Woolsey)
     However, I would still like to accompany Colonel Sheppard and Doctor
     McKay to Belkan.

     WOOLSEY
     Of course.

   [The trio leaves. The doors close as Mister Woolsey gets up and gathers
   his things. They stay closed as he approaches them. He steps back and
   tries to get the doors to reopen, but they remain sealed, even as he
   waves his arm.]

   INT--SARIF SUR CELL

   [Ronon awakens to find himself bound to a chair and sitting in a dark
   cell. He looks around frantically.]

     RONON

     (panicked)
     Teyla!

   [He spots Tyre sitting nearby. Tyre's eyes are wide and bloodshot.]

     RONON
     Where's Teyla?

     TYRE
     I left her back on the planet. Don't worry, she's fine. You knew I
     wouldn't hurt her.

     RONON

     (sneering)
     Do I?

     TYRE
     I accept the fact that you no longer trust me, but I'm hoping that
     will change in time. Sateda is gone. We're the last of our kind,
     Ronon. We're brothers, not enemies.

     RONON
     We're brothers? So I should just forgive you for setting me up last
     year?

   [Tyre stands and approaches.]

     TYRE
     If you had just listened to reason, things could've been different.
     Ara and Rakai would still be alive, and we'd all be working together
     again.

     RONON
     As Wraith worshippers and traitors to the memories of Sateda? Hell
     no!

     TYRE
     Of course not. I see that now. You're blinded by the past. Lied to
     by your so-called "friends" on Atlantis. But I still have faith in
     you, old friend. You just needs to open your eyes to the truth.

     RONON
     All right. Just untie me, and I'll listen to what you have to say.

     TYRE
     Heh. Would that be before or after you try to beat me unconscious?

     RONON
     I don't know. You choose. Or I could just surprise you.

     TYRE
     I don't doubt it.

   [He goes to take a drink from his cup, but his hand shakes
   spasmodically.]

     RONON
     What's wrong with you?

     TYRE
     I'm not well. But I've been worse. You know where we are?

   [Ronon glances around and shrugs in ignorance.]

     TYRE
     You remember Sarif Sur, don't you?

     RONON
     Yeah, you almost died on that run.

     TYRE
     We both nearly died because you refused to leave me behind. You
     risked your life to save me.

   [He takes off a Satedan dog-tag.]

     TYRE
     Today...I return the favor.

   [Shakily, he passes the dog tag to Ronon.]

   EXT--BELKAN VILLAGE, NIGHT

   INT--TAVERN

   [The team approach a man sitting at a table, his head resting on his
   arms and his pistol by his side on the table.]

     TEYLA
     Solen Sincha?

     SOLEN

     (groaning)
     Mmm. Go away. Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?

   [Sheppard drops his pistol on the table with a deliberate clatter, the
   barrel facing Solen Sincha. Solen looks up, becoming alert as he takes
   in the military bearing of the trio.]

     SHEPPARD
     We need your help.

     MCKAY
     Ronon Dex is in trouble.

     SOLEN
     Ronon Dex is always in trouble.

     MCKAY
     Well, his life is in danger.

     SOLEN
     Again. What else is new?

   [Sheppard sits down across from him.]

     SOLEN
     What kind of trouble has he gotten himself into this time?

     TEYLA
     He was abducted by a fellow Satedan--a Wraith worshipper by the name
     of Tyre.

   [Solen sighs and holsters his pistol. Sheppard does the same with his.]

     SOLEN
     You mean, former Wraith worshipper. Word is, the dog disappointed
     his masters, so they turned him loose.

     MCKAY
     Well, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.

     SOLEN
     Not exactly. So long as he's on the run, he's a living, breathing
     example of what happens to humans who disappoint them. Tyre's a
     marked man now. Most anyone I know would kill him on sight. It's
     just a matter of time.

     TEYLA
     He was once a proud Satedan, not unlike yourself. He was subjected
     to unimaginable torture. Perhaps he had no choice.

     SOLEN

     (sternly)
     There's always a choice. He could've chosen death like a true
     Satedan.

     SHEPPARD

     (smoothly)
     Any idea where we could find him?

     SOLEN
     If I knew that, he'd already be dead.

     SHEPPARD
     All right, Tyre's not thinking straight, right?

     SOLEN

     (cautiously)
     Sure.

     SHEPPARD
     So it's probably just a matter of time before he slips up. And when
     he does, I'm assuming your leads will hear about it.

     SOLEN
     Probably.

     SHEPPARD
     So what do you say, you contact us when you hear something, we'll
     deal with Tyre and save you the trip.

   [Solen studies them.]

     SOLEN
     All right. To Ronon!

   [He toasts with his bottle of liquor and drinks straight from the
   bottle.]

   INT--SARIF SUR CELL

     RONON
     Look at you. You can barely walk. Let me get you some help.

     TYRE
     I'm beyond your help.

     RONON
     It's the Wraith, isn't it? What did they do to you?

     TYRE
     At this point, it's not so much what they did to me as what they
     "aren't" doing to me.

     RONON
     Giving you life? Reverse-feeding? Whatever the hell it's called?

     TYRE
     It's hard to describe. That sense of euphoria it offers is...

   [He starts breathing heavily, licking his lips at the thought.]

     RONON
     You became addicted to it.

     TYRE
     You can't understand unless you've experienced it yourself. It was a
     gift--one that was denied me after I allowed you and your friends to
     escape us.

     RONON
     Hey...free me, and I'll get you some help. I promise.

     TYRE
     Help is already on the way, for both of us.

     RONON

     (worried)
     What does that mean? What the hell did you do?

   [The door opens. A Wraith and two soldier Wraith enter.]

     TYRE
     I've saved us.

   [Ronon and the Wraith exchange sneers.]

     WRAITH
     Ronon Dex. I looked forward to the day when you would finally serve
     me.

     RONON
     Well, then, I'm going to feel real bad disappointing you.

     WRAITH
     Oh, I'm sure you'll try. But in the end, you'll come around.

   [The Wraith feeds on Ronon, who cries out in pain.]

   INT--WOOLSEY'S OFFICE

   [Woolsey unpacks items to decorate his office as Teyla enters.]

     TEYLA
     Mister Woolsey?

     WOOLSEY
     Teyla. Any news on Ronon?

     TEYLA

     (sighing)
     Not yet.

     WOOLSEY
     I'm sorry. I suppose we can draw comfort from the fact that he is a
     proven survivor. He defied the odds for many years as a runner.

     TEYLA
     Yes, he did.

     WOOLSEY
     How can I help you?

     TEYLA
     I wanted to...apologize for not having come to you sooner with a
     decision regarding my position on the colonel's team.

     WOOLSEY
     Take whatever time you need. If necessary, I can assign someone to
     fill in for you.

     TEYLA

     (nonplussed)
     Oh...Mister Woolsey, do you have children?

     WOOLSEY
     Uh...no. But I did have a Yorkie for many years.

   [Teyla looks puzzled.]

     WOOLSEY
     It's a...small dog.

     TEYLA
     Ah.

     WOOLSEY
     But my wife got him in the divorce...I loved that dog. I never
     really had the chance to say goodbye. So, no, no children.

     TEYLA
     Then with all due respect, you may not understand how difficult this
     is for me.

   [Woolsey stops unpacking and gives Teyla his full attention.]

     TEYLA
     For most of my life, I never imagined the possibility of leaving my
     people, not even for a moment. And then, circumstances changed. And
     after realizing a far more important role on Colonel Sheppard's
     team, I never imagined a day would come when I would have to...let
     it go, and now here that day is.

     WOOLSEY
     Five years ago, if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a
     job outside of the Milky Way, my answer would've been a definite no.
     And now...look at me. So...while I can't...empathize, I certainly do
     sympathize. Believe me, I know...priorities change.

   [Teyla considers this.]

     TEYLA
     And sometimes they don't.

     WOOLSEY
     Teyla, I'm sure Kanaan will support you, whatever decision you make.

     TEYLA
     Yes. Of course he will. Thank you, Mister Woolsey.

   [She leaves.]

   INT--SARIF SUR CELL

   [The Wraith revives Ronon through the feeding process. Ronon, who's
   hair and skin looked aged, now looks as he did before. He slumps, his
   face contorted in agony. He has a feeding wound on his chest.]

     WRAITH
     How does it feel to have your life stolen? To be pushed so close to
     the darkness, only to be pulled back from the brink? From what I
     understand, it's a magnificent sensation.

     RONON
     To be honest, I've felt better.

     WRAITH
     Defy me all you want. Your fellow Satedans were no different. Like
     them, you will eventually submit.

     RONON
     I'll die before I submit.

     WRAITH
     No, you won't.

   [The Wraith begins to feed again. Ronon tries to resist, but finally
   roars in pain.]

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [McKay enters and stares with unusual distaste at the breakfast buffet.
   He turns and spots Sheppard sitting alone at a table.]

     MCKAY
     Hey! You're up early!

     SHEPPARD
     It's ten A.M.

   [McKay sits down across from Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     It is? Uh, gah, I didn't sleep at all, I was up all night thinking
     about this Ronon situation.

     SHEPPARD
     Got anything?

     MCKAY
     Nothing. I tried everything: pacing, snacking, bathing...

     SHEPPARD
     Bathing?

     MCKAY
     Yeah. Like Archimedes.

     SHEPPARD
     You mean the Greek scientist who had a crush on Teyla?

     MCKAY
     No, like the Greek mathematician who came up with the Archimedes
     principle--the physical laws of buoyancy? According to legend, the
     idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so...look the
     point is, that the revelation occurred while he was, you know,
     relaxing. You know, not thinking about the problem. And the
     solution, as it turned out, was right in front of him all along.

     SHEPPARD
     You think we've overlooked something?

     MCKAY
     I don't know. Maybe? Look, all I know is I was up all night going
     over it, and I'm drawing a blank. So...I could use a fresh
     perspective.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not taking a bath with you.

     MCKAY
     No, let's...just go over what we know.

     SHEPPARD
     According to Solen, Tyre's on the run. And we can assume he's
     operating alone, because, if he had backup, they would've been in on
     the ambush.

     MCKAY
     Right. He's alone, with Ronon, on the run. So, where would someone
     like that go? Well, I could think of something like 200 uninhabited
     planets that would be perfect. Where do you want to start?

   [Lorne arrives at the table.]

     LORNE
     How about Sarif Sur?

     SHEPPARD
     What?

     LORNE
     We just got a message from Ronon's buddy Solen. He hears that Tyre
     and Ronon are holed up on a planet called Sarif Sur.

     MCKAY
     Thank you, Archimedes.

   [Sheppard gets up.]

     SHEPPARD
     Major, get your team and gear up.

     LORNE
     Yes, sir.

   INT--SARIF SUR CELL

   [Tyre leans close to Ronon.]

     TYRE
     There's just no point in holding on. You're just putting off the
     inevitable. It's better if you just accept it.

     RONON

     (weakly, but bitter)
     You mean better for you, don't you? The Wraith cut you off, and this
     is your way back in, by offering me up as a sacrifice.

     TYRE
     No.

     RONON

     (weeping)
     You're not the man I risked my life for. You are a traitor to the
     memory of our people. You have no honor.

   [The door opens and the lead Wraith reenters.]

     WRAITH
     Things are progressing too slowly. I have other matters to attend
     to. We can continue this process back at the lab.

   [Tyre stumbles to his feet.]

     TYRE
     And when will I receive my reward?

   [The guards approach Ronon and stun him into unconsciousness for
   transport. Tyre doesn't even glance back, solely looking at the
   Wraith.]

     WRAITH
     Your reward?

     TYRE
     I brought him here as we agreed. In exchange, you promised to
     restore our previous arrangement.

     WRAITH
     Huh. Did I?

   [The Wraith turns to go.]

     TYRE
     You promised!

   [The Wraith spins and grabs Tyre by the throat, choking him.]

     WRAITH
     I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint, since your usefulness
     has come to an end.

   [He throws Tyre back against the wall. The guards drag the unconscious
   Ronon with them, following the leader.]

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [The Stargate kawooshes. Lorne's team and Sheppard and McKay head out.
   Sheppard looks up at the balcony where Woolsey stands before he
   leaves.]

     SHEPPARD
     We'll get him.

     WOOLSEY
     See that you do, Colonel.

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--SARIF SUR, NIGHT

   [Sheppard, McKay, and Lorne's teams spread out through the village.]

   INT--SARIF SUR BUILDING

   [Sheppard checks out the upper level of a building while McKay scans
   downstairs.]

     SHEPPARD
     Nothing.

   [He heads down to join McKay.]

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     So we were wrong. It has been known to happen. Hey, I always said
     this was a long shot.

     LORNE

     (over radio)
     Colonel, this is Lorne. We've got something.

     MCKAY
     I knew it!

   [They rush out.]

   EXT--SARIF SUR, NIGHT

     LORNE
     Over here.

   INT--SARIF SUR CELL

   [Lorne leads them over to where some of his team stand over an
   unconscious Tyre.]

     LORNE
     We checked his pulse. It's barely there. We gotta move him, or we
     lose him.

     MCKAY
     Where's Ronon?

     SHEPPARD
     Good question.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

   [Tyre lies strapped to an infirmary bed, unconscious, but spasming and
   twitching in his sleep.]

     KELLER
     His injuries are minor, but...both his heart-rate and blood pressure
     are elevated. He woke up about an hour after you brought him in. He
     was delirious; he was sweating, nauseous, trembling. So, I sedated
     him and ran some tests. After giving him a drug that blocks opioid
     receptors, I noticed a drop in dopamine levels here--a central link
     in the brain's reward circuit.

   [She shows a screen of his brain scan.]

     SHEPPARD
     Meaning?

     KELLER
     Meaning this type of neuro-chemical activity is identical to that of
     reforming substance-users. He's going through withdrawal.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard storms out, Keller and McKay following.]

     SHEPPARD
     I need to save him, Doc. Right now, he's our only lead. If he dies,
     our chances of finding Ronon go with him.

     KELLER
     Of course, but it could be days before he's coherent enough to tell
     us anything.

   [Teyla runs up.]

     TEYLA
     John! Why wasn't I informed about the mission to rescue Ronon?

     SHEPPARD

     (awkwardly)
     We were playing on a hunch. We had to act fast.

   [Teyla glares at Sheppard.]

     MCKAY
     I'm going to go, um, see if they're still serving lunch. It's
     Taquito Tuesday.

     KELLER
     I think I'll join you.

   [The pair hurry away from the forthcoming argument.]

     TEYLA
     I'm surprised that you would be so quick to move forward without me.

     SHEPPARD
     Don't put this on me. You're the one having second thoughts about
     returning to the team. I cannot give you the option every time we're
     going off-world.

     TEYLA
     This is not an easy decision for me.

     SHEPPARD
     You think you're the only one feeling pressure? I've got Woolsey
     pushing me hard to find a replacement for you.

     TEYLA

     (shocked)
     What did you tell him?

     SHEPPARD
     I told him that I wasn't going to do anything until I talked to you.
     Now, if you want to join the team, great. I'll call Woolsey. I'll
     make it happen. But if you want to spend time with your son, I
     understand. I do. I really do. You've got to make a decision!

   [He leaves Teyla standing there.]

   EXT--WRAITH FACILITY, DAY

   INT--WRAITH LAB

   [Ronon is an upright position, restrained by a Wraith web.]

     WRAITH
     You're finally awake. The procedure can be very taxing. You've been
     unconscious for the better part of a day.

     RONON
     You're wasting your time. I'll die before I turn. Just like Marika
     and Hemi.

     WRAITH

     (chuckling)
     I'm afraid you're mistaken. Your friends didn't die because they
     were strong. They died because they were too weak to withstand the
     process. Their minds and bodies eventually shut down under the
     strain. But you...you're stronger. And it is your strength that will
     prove your undoing.

   [The Wraith feeds on Ronon again. Ronon screams.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Tyre screams as he goes through detox, still restrained to the
   gurney.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   [Keller, Woolsey, Sheppard, and McKay watch Tyre below.]

     KELLER
     He broke through his restraints this morning and injured two guards,
     so I thought it would be best to put him in isolation. At least this
     way, if he breaks free again, he won't be an immediate danger to
     anyone.

     SHEPPARD
     How long is it going to take him to go through this?

     KELLER

     (shrugging)
     To be honest, I'm not even sure he will.

     TYRE

     (yelling through window)
     Please! You're killing me! Please!

     WOOLSEY
     Can't you give him something for the pain?

     KELLER
     Sedatives will make him more comfortable, but they'll also slow down
     his recovery.

     SHEPPARD
     I want this to go as quick as possible. No sedatives.

   [He leaves the room.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Tyre screams again.]

   INT--WRAITH LAB

   [Ronon screams as the Wraith feeds.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Tyre screams and writhes.]

   INT--WRAITH LAB

   [The Wraith feeds again. Ronon doesn't react.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Tyre writhes and screams.]

   INT--WRAITH LAB

   [Ronon regenerates to his former state. His expression is stony.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Tyre falls into a peaceful sleep.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Teyla rocks a sleeping Torren in a cradle. Kanaan enters.]

     KANAAN

     (whispering)
     He's already sleeping? Why does it take so much longer when I try to
     put him down?

     TEYLA

     (whispering)
     You worry too much. Perhaps he senses your anxiety.

     KANAAN
     Maybe he prefers the comfort of his mother's presence.

   [They exchange wry smiles.]

     TEYLA
     Well, there may be times when he will have to learn to do without.

     KANAAN
     Does that mean you've decided?

     TEYLA
     I thought so...how can I return to the team with the knowledge that
     every time I step through the 'gate, there is a chance that I might
     not come back? That given the dangers, there is a possibility that
     our son will grow up without a mother.

     KANAAN
     You have a responsibility to him...but you also have a
     responsibility to the people of this galaxy. Follow your heart
     without remorse, and take comfort in knowing that you'll be doing so
     to safeguard the future of many, including your son. Just promise me
     you'll be careful out there.

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Keller walks with Sheppard.]

     KELLER
     He's been awake and lucid for about ten minutes now.

     SHEPPARD
     What did he say?

     KELLER
     Only that he wanted to talk to you.

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Keller and Sheppard enter.]

     TYRE
     I know where they've taken Ronon.

     SHEPPARD
     Can you give us a 'gate address?

     TYRE
     Better. I'll lead you right into the heart of the facility.

     SHEPPARD

     (evasive)
     Well, you're still recovering.

     TYRE
     Doctor Keller told me there was no longer any traces of the Wraith
     enzyme in my system.

     SHEPPARD
     That's not the point.

     TYRE
     Colonel, please! Let me help you get Ronon back!

   [Sheppard studies Tyre's desperate, but earnest, expression.]

   INT--WRAITH LAB

     WRAITH
     No retreat in the face of battle. No sympathy for the fallen. No
     mercy for our enemies.

   [Ronon kneels in front of the Wraith.]

     RONON
     No retreat in the face of battle. No sympathy for the fallen. And no
     mercy to your enemies.

     WRAITH
     Our enemies. Atlantis.

   [He holds out a broadsword for Ronon to take. Ronon looks at it and
   takes it while standing up.]

     RONON
     Atlantis.

     WRAITH

     (smiling)
     No mercy.

   [Ronon wields the blade.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard and Woolsey talk in a corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     He seems rational, says he wants to help us.

     WOOLSEY
     I say we trust him only as much as we have to. Use his intel, but he
     stays here, under guard.

     SHEPPARD
     If you want to hit that Wraith facility, we're gonna need all the
     help we can get, and apparently he knows that place inside and out.

     WOOLSEY
     Yes, and is thus in a perfect position to lead you right into a
     trap!

     SHEPPARD
     Whoa, all right, look! I think as much as he'd like us to believe
     it, this is not about regaining some...lost honor or some Satedan
     revenge thing. Pure and simple, this is about a desperate guy who's
     willing to do anything to help his buddy.

     WOOLSEY
     And how can you be so certain of that, Colonel?

     SHEPPARD

     (firmly)
     Because I've been there.

   [Teyla comes up behind them, walking with Torren in her arms.]

     SHEPPARD
     Now, we have a chance to get Ronon, and I'm gonna take it, and
     you're going to need to trust me on this.

     WOOLSEY
     All right. Major Lorne's team will be accompanying you.

   [Sheppard heads out. Teyla starts to hurry after them.]

     TEYLA
     What is it? What's happening?!

   [Sheppard glances back but keeps moving.]

     SHEPPARD
     We know where Ronon is.

     TEYLA
     I'm coming with you!

     SHEPPARD

     (not breaking stride)
     Gear up.

     WOOLSEY
     Uh, Teyla, this is exactly the kind of decision we were discuss--

     TEYLA
     I was just about to meet Kanaan in the cafeteria. Would you please
     explain to him the situation?

   [She places the infant in a surprised Woolsey's arms. Torren fusses]

     TEYLA

     (to Torren)
     Shh. It's all right.
     (to Woolsey, desperately)
     Please!

     WOOLSEY

     (nodding)
     All right.

   [Teyla runs after Sheppard. Woolsey bounces the baby in his arms.]

     WOOLSEY
     Well, well, well, who have we here?

   [Torren begins to cry.]

     WOOLSEY

     (panicked)
     Cafeteria. Cafeteria!

   [Woolsey goes in one direction, then another, trying to find the
   correct way.]

   EXT--WRAITH FACILITY, DAY

   INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR

   [Wraith soldiers patrol the corridor. Tyre strikes them both down with
   his sword.]

     TYRE
     This way.

   [He leads the team down a corridor.]

   INT--WRAITH POWER RELAY CHAMBER

   [The rescue team shoots and kills another guard as they enter. Tyre
   makes certain he is dead while Sheppard directs placement for C-4.]

     TEYLA
     What is this place?

     TYRE
     You were looking for a target area that would maximize the effects
     of your explosives. Well, this is it. The facility's power relay
     chamber. Hide your charges to avoid discovery.

   [He indicates a good placement.]

     SHEPPARD
     Let's go.

   [Everyone plants C-4 is inconspicuous spots.]

     TYRE
     I assume you have the means to remote-detonate from a safe distance?

   [Sheppard pulls out a remote detonator from his tac vest.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, just flip...click.

   INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR

   [Tyre leads the team down another corridor.]

     TYRE
     This way.

   [He leads the teams to another area. Once everyone inside a
   transporter, Tyre activates it.]

   INT--WRAITH CORRIDORS

   [They beam into another level and head down a corridor. Ronon appears
   at the other end, looking unconcerned and calm, with a disconcerting
   smile on his face.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon.

     RONON

     (calmly)
     Sheppard. It's about time.

     SHEPPARD

     (warily)
     What's going on, buddy?

   [The Wraith appears behind Ronon.]

     WRAITH
     We were beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up.

   [Wraith guards appear behind the team, surrounding them. The team
   raises their weapons in a standoff.]

     WRAITH
     You're at a disadvantage. You can attempt an escape, but you'll have
     to sacrifice your friend's life to do so.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon, get out of the way.

     RONON
     I can't do that.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon, step aside.

   [Tyre licks his lips then grabs Teyla in a choke hold, holding a knife
   to her throat.]

     TYRE
     His life wouldn't be the only one forfeit.

     TEYLA
     Tyre....

     TYRE
     Lower your weapons.

   [Sheppard gauges the situation, then lowers his rifle. The others
   follow suit.]

     WRAITH
     Take them away.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon, what's happening here?

   [Ronon punches Sheppard full in the face. He collapses unconscious,
   caught by the guards.]

     TEYLA
     Ronon!

   [They are led away. Tyre remains behind.]

     TYRE
     I assume this is a prize worthy of reward?

     WRAITH
     Welcome back.

   [Ronon slaps Tyre on the shoulder.]

   INT--WRAITH CELL

   [Sheppard, McKay and Teyla are trapped together.]

     MCKAY
     Well, you know, on the bright side, at least we'll never have to go
     back to Atlantis and hear Woolsey say "I told you so."

     SHEPPARD
     We're going to get out of here.

     MCKAY
     Oh, sure. I mean, all we have to do is escape from this cell, right?
     And get past all of the armed Wraith that are guarding the facility.
     And free Lorne and his team from wherever they're being held. And
     get back to the jumper, which is probably being disassembled as we
     speak. And, right, of course, we've got to rescue Ronon, who, I
     don't know if you happened to notice or not, isn't quite himself!

     SHEPPARD
     We're going to get Ronon, and we're going to go back to Atlantis.

     MCKAY
     And even if we do, then what, huh? I mean, Tyre's recovery hasn't
     exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.

   [While McKay panics, Teyla stares out the door with a blank
   expression.]

     SHEPPARD

     (more insistent)
     We're going to get Ronon back.

     MCKAY

     (sighing)
     Yeah, of course.

   [He paces near Teyla and gives her a thumbs up sign.]

     MCKAY

     (to Teyla)
     We're going to get him back.

   INT--WRAITH LAB

   [The Wraith paces as Ronon and Tyre stand nearby.]

     RONON
     You waste a huge opportunity by killing them.

     WRAITH
     They have no use to me beyond the information they can provide.

     RONON
     You underestimate their value.

     WRAITH
     Is it their value I underestimate or your loyalty I overestimate?

     TYRE
     Ronon's right. They're much more useful to you alive and
     cooperative.

     RONON
     They just need some convincing.

   [The Wraith considers this.]

   INT--WRAITH CELL

     MCKAY
     All right, I got it. We tell them we have some vital information
     that we're willing to give up, but we will only share it with Ronon.
     So they send Ronon, he shows up, we appeal to him--I mean, the part
     of him that-that's still...him.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I can only think of...three things wrong with that plan, but
     go on.

     MCKAY
     He hasn't been brainwashed as long as Tyre, which means he might be
     more susceptible to our influence. We convince him to let us out
     or-or lead us out of here, and-and, you know, worst case scenario,
     he's not entirely convinced--

     SHEPPARD

     (doubtful)
     That's your worst case scenario?

     MCKAY
     Hey, I'm just spinning here, but, um, we could take advantage of
     that moment of uncertainty and-and-and...

     TYRE
     Sheppard!

   [The cell door opens. Tyre and guards wait outside.]

     TYRE
     You've been summoned.

     MCKAY

     (low, to Sheppard)
     Do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?

     SHEPPARD

     No. No, I-I think I'm good.
     (to Tyre)
     I guess it's my turn for the sales pitch, huh?

   [He pats McKay reassuringly on the shoulder and follows Tyre. The cell
   door closes behind him.]

   INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR

     TYRE
     Wait. We need to get something.

   [The guard pushes Sheppard to follow Tyre.]

   INT--WRAITH LAB

     WRAITH
     Hmm.

   [Tyre shoves Sheppard into the lab. The Wraith and Ronon await.]

     WRAITH
     Kneel.

     SHEPPARD
     You know what would be really creepy and unexpected is if you knelt
     instead.

   [Tyre kicks the back of Sheppard's legs, forcing him to his knees with
   a pained cry.]

     SHEPPARD
     God...I guess not. All right, I'll try to make it work.

     WRAITH
     I appreciate your defiance.

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon, I really need you to snap out of it about now.

   [Ronon watches and does nothing.]

     WRAITH
     It will make turning you all the more enjoyable.

   [The Wraith snarls and holds out his feeding arm, about to feed on
   Sheppard. Tyre unsheathes his sword and cuts off the Wraith's hand.
   Ronon unsheathes his own sword, and he and Tyre do battle. The Wraith
   goes to attack, but Sheppard pulls out two pistols from behind his back
   and shoots the Wraith from point-blank range with both barrels. Ronon
   and Tyre continue to sword-fight as Sheppard shoots at oncoming guards.
   Ronon is able to get under Tyre's guard and slash him across the
   abdomen. He pulls off Tyre's dog-tag.]

   INT--WRAITH CELLS

   [Lorne watches from his team's cell as the guards are killed by gun
   fire. Teyla and McKay arrive and open the cell.]

     LORNE
     Teyla! McKay! How'd you get out?

     MCKAY
     Tyre freed us! Let's go!

   [He starts handing Lorne's team their weapons.]

     LORNE
     Okay, come on, guys.

   [They run.]

   INT--WRAITH LAB

   [Sheppard continues to hold off guards as the sword battle turns into
   unarmed hand-to hand-combat when Tyre is able to disarm Ronon. Ronon
   still gets the better of Tyre, knocking him to the floor and beating
   him. Teyla arrives and stuns him several times before Ronon falls.]

     TEYLA
     Go go go!

   [Lorne's team grabs Ronon and moves ahead.]

     SHEPPARD
     How's it going?

     MCKAY
     Not so good!

   [McKay covers their retreat. Lorne runs back down the corridor to
   rejoin Sheppard's team.]

     LORNE
     My guys are holding them off, but not for much longer.

     SHEPPARD
     Give me that.

   [Sheppard takes Lorne's sidearm and strides over to the wounded
   Wraith.]

     SHEPPARD
     Tell them to back off.

     WRAITH
     My life will be a small price to pay for the lives of you...and your
     team.

   [Sheppard kicks the Wraith's wound. Tyre pulls the detonator where it
   sticks out of Sheppard's pocket.]

     TYRE
     Then how about the destruction of this facility? Is that a small
     enough price as well?

     WRAITH
     You lie.

     TYRE
     I told them where to hide the charges for maximum effect--enough
     explosives to destroy this place and all its research. Any advantage
     your hide may hold over its rivals will be gone with the push of a
     button.

   [Gunfire sounds in the distance as Tyre primes the explosives. Sheppard
   watches worriedly, but does not stop Tyre.]

     WRAITH
     Wait!

   INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR

   [The team is pinned down near the exit by Wraith guards. The lead
   Wraith is bound and held with them as a hostage.]

     SHEPPARD
     Tell them to let us through.

     WRAITH
     What's to stop you from triggering the explosives from a safe
     distance?

     TYRE
     My presence here. You let them go, I'll remain behind.

     TEYLA

     (warningly)
     Tyre...

     TYRE

     (ignoring Teyla)
     Once they've reached the 'gate, I'll trade you this device for my
     freedom... or we all die together!

   [He clutches the detonator tighter. The Wraith rolls his eyes,
   defeated.]

     WRAITH

     (calling to other Wraith)
     Let them go!

   [The guards lower their weapons and drop back. Tyre takes off his sword
   and scabbard and hands them to Sheppard with a sober expression.]

     TYRE
     I'll be right behind you.

   [He gives a single poignant nod to Sheppard, who pauses for a moment,
   then gravely returns the nod.]

     SHEPPARD

     (to others)
     Let's go!

   [The Atlantis teams run out of the facility, two of Lorne's men
   carrying the unconscious Ronon.]

   [Back in the corridor, Tyre presses the hostage Wraith up against the
   wall.]

     WRAITH
     You turn your back on an incredible gift.

     TYRE
     Actually, you turned your back on me first. And I thank you for it.

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     We're clear!

     WRAITH
     You are not beyond forgiveness. It's not too late for you.

     TYRE
     Yes it is...for both of us.

   [Tyre detonates the explosives.]

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM

   violently struggle against the restraints holding him to a gurney in
   the isolation room.]

     WOOLSEY
     What kind of a time frame for recovery are we looking at?

     KELLER
     Ack, it's impossible to predict. He had so much of the enzyme
     running through him that his body can hardly process it. When it
     eventually does, that's when he'll come down...and he'll come down
     hard.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm going to talk to him.

   watches Sheppard enter.]

     RONON
     There he is. Hey, buddy.

     SHEPPARD
     Buddy?

     RONON
     So, how long are you planning on keeping me prisoner?

     SHEPPARD
     As long as it takes to clear your head.

     RONON
     My head is clear.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you may be feeling fine right now, but...things are going to
     get pretty rough for you. We're going to get you through this.

     RONON
     Whatever you've got planned? It's not going to work. You've got a
     choice: you can either kill me, or you let me go. And if you let me
     go, I promise I won't come after you...or Atlantis. Tell Tyre I
     won't come after him either.

     SHEPPARD
     Tyre's dead. He sacrificed himself taking out the Wraith lab.

   [Ronon appears stunned for a moment, but he tries to hide his concern.]

     RONON
     Well, he was a traitor.

     SHEPPARD
     No, he was a good friend. We all are. You're going to realize that
     pretty soon.

   [He turns to go.]

     RONON
     Hey, will you just kill me or set me free. Sheppard?!

   [Sheppard leaves.]

     RONON

     (calling after him)
     You kill me or set me free! Sheppard!

   EXT--ATLANTIS NIGHT

   INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM

   [Ronon groans and cries out in pain.]

     RONON
     Kill me please! Please, kill me! No!

   [Ronon writhes and screams as time passes. He tries to break free of
   the restraints to no avail.]

   [McKay watches from the observation room as Keller checks on Ronon.]

   [Later, Sheppard sits in the room with Ronon.]

   [Later still, McKay sits with Ronon, who's sleeping peacefully.]

     MCKAY
     ...I had what they call piano fingers--slim, nimble. You know, it's
     really no surprise that my parents signed me up for lessons. My
     first teacher, of course, hailed me as a natural. Big Russian woman,
     Polanski or Baranski or...

     RONON

     (hoarsely)
     Sheppard...

     MCKAY
     ...definitely a "ski"...Ronon?

   [McKay jumps off the stool, suddenly realizing Ronon's conscious.]

     MCKAY
     Hey, uh, how do you feel?

   [Ronon looks around. He appears exhausted, but calm. His eyes no longer
   have a manic gleam to them.]

     RONON
     Like hitting someone?

     MCKAY

     (warily)
     Anyone in particular?

     RONON
     You, if you don't loosen these straps and get me something to eat.

     MCKAY

     (grinning)
     That-that is a good sign! That's a good sign!

   [McKay bounds out of the room, elated.]

     MCKAY

     (shouting as he leaves)
     He's back! He's back!

   INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM

   [Woolsey, Sheppard, McKay, Teyla, and Keller, sit around the table.]

     WOOLSEY
     So he's fully recovered?

     KELLER
     Well, physically, he's still weak, but his blood-work shows no
     traces of the enzyme in his system. So, he should be back to his old
     self in no time.

     WOOLSEY
     Good to hear. Well, it's late. I think I'll head back to my quarters
     and change into something a little more relaxed. Good night.

   [He gets up and gathers his items. He pauses a moment, but this time
   the doors open for them. He glances at Sheppard with a satisfied smile.
   The others start to leave.]

     TEYLA
     John, may I have a word?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Sure.

   EXT--ATLANTIS NIGHT

   INT--WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS

   [Woolsey opens the door to find Teyla standing there. Classical music
   plays from his stereo. He is dressed in a grey suit and holds a glass
   of red wine.]

     WOOLSEY
     Teyla. Come in.

     TEYLA
     I thought you said you were changing into something more relaxed?

     WOOLSEY
     For me, this is more relaxed. Can I offer you a drink?

     TEYLA
     No, thank you. I just spoke with John, and now I would like to make
     it official. I am requesting a return to active duty. I would like
     to resume my position on Colonel Sheppard's team.

     WOOLSEY
     You're sure this is what you want?

     TEYLA
     Very much so.

     WOOLSEY
     Well, then, welcome back.

   [He toasts her with his glass.]

     TEYLA
     Thank you, Mister Woolsey. Good night.

     TEYLA
     Good night.

   [Teyla exits. Woolsey turns up the music and stares out the window,
   still nursing his wine.]

   INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS

   [Kanaan holds Torren as Teyla enters. He hands over their son. She
   cradles him as Kanaan looks on, smiling.]

   INT--BATHROOM

   [McKay relaxes in a bubble bath. Struck by sudden inspiration, he
   sluffs off the bubbles from his hand, grabs the tablet computer from
   nearby, and starts to work.]

   INT--INFIRMARY

   [Ronon lies unrestrained in a hospital bed. Sheppard enters, carrying
   Tyre's sword. Wordlessly, he lays the sword at Ronon's side on the bed,
   hesitates, nods, and leaves. Ronon unsheathes the sword and studies it
   before cradling it to his chest.]

   FADE OUT
