TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--CARTER'S OFFICE
[Teyla briefs Carter and the other members of her team.]
TEYLA
They are called the Vadeenans. I've known about them my entire life,
but I've never met them. They do occasionally trade with others in
the galaxy, but for the most part, they keep to themselves.
CARTER
And you want to visit them because...?
TEYLA
It is said that their leader, a man named Davos, is a great seer.
MCKAY
What do you mean, like a psychic?
TEYLA
I do not know the full extent of his powers, but it is rumored that
he can...even glimpse the future.
MCKAY
(chuckling)
Oh, give me a break.
TEYLA
You do not believe such a thing is possible.
MCKAY
Well, gee, let me think. Um...no. Look, in a-in a mechanical,
Newtonian universe? Not a problem. I mean, you know enough
variables, you can predict the outcome. But, uh, quantum physics
blows that out of the water.
TEYLA
I understand your skepticism. Even among my own people, the stories
were not widely believed. But I need to know for myself.
CARTER
You think this Davos might be able to help you find out what
happened to your people?
TEYLA
I realize that it may seem...desperate, but...it has been several
weeks, and our usual means of investigation have turned up nothing.
CARTER
Rodney, what's the latest from the forensics team from New Athos?
MCKAY
Uh, well...they're-they're still searching, but so far, they haven't
found anything useful.
SHEPPARD
Intel hasn't turned up anything either. As far as we know, they
vanished into thin air.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay are geared up and heading to the active Stargate.]
MCKAY
Allow me to make a prediction. This will be a complete waste of
time.
[They meet up with Teyla and Ronon.]
SHEPPARD
I knew you were going to say that. All right, from what Teyla says,
these people sound a little skittish. You can bet that four heavily
armed strangers showing up out of nowhere are going to set 'em off a
little. So...let's be on our best behavior, children.
[They step into the event horizon.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--VADEENAN PLANET, DAY
[The team steps out to find a large greeting party of Vadeenans who are
smiling at the team.]
LINAR
Welcome. You must be the people of Atlantis.
SHEPPARD
(low, to Teyla)
These people don't look very surprised.
MCKAY
You sure you didn't tell them we were coming?
TEYLA
I've had no previous contact with these people.
LINARA
My name is Linara.
SHEPPARD
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.
LINARA
We know. We know all of you. You've been expected for some time now.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Woolsey arrives through the Stargate, wheeling a small rollaway
suitcase behind him. Carter is there to greet him.]
CARTER
Mister Woolsey. How was your trip?
WOOLSEY
Well, spending a day in quarantine on the Midway station wasn't
exactly my idea of a good time. But I suppose it beats a three week
journey on the Daedalus.
[She and Woolsey walk up the steps and head through the control room to
the balcony outside.]
CARTER
Well, that quarantine was only set up at the insistence of the IOA.
WOOLSEY
In response to some recent contagions that have taken hold on this
base. Let's face it, Midway is the only buffer between Pegasus and
the Milky Way. It can't hurt to err on the side of caution. Anyway,
it gave me a chance to prepare for your three-month evaluation.
CARTER
(taking a nervous breath)
Right. So, how am I doing so far?
WOOLSEY
That's exactly what needs to be determined. But I want you to know,
I'm here as an observer only. I have no intention of getting
involved in the day-to-day operations of the base.
CARTER
Really? Heh. That's refreshing.
WOOLSEY
Well, the IOA has come to realize that bureaucratic interference on
Atlantis isn't always as beneficial as we might like to hope. And,
on a personal note, it's been brought to my attention in my own
performance evaluations, that I can...on occasion...be a bit of a
busybody.
[He chuckles nervously and looks at Carter expectantly.]
CHUCK
(over comm)
Unscheduled offworld activation!
CARTER
(smiling in relief)
Excuse me.
[She walks back into the control room, Woolsey follows.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
CHUCK
We're receiving a signal. It's Captain Robbins, on M2R-441.
CARTER
(to Woolsey)
Uh, they're delivering medical supplies to a planet that was
recently culled.
(to Chuck)
Patch 'em in.
[Woolsey unzips his portfolio to take notes.]
CARTER
(into comm)
Captain, this is Colonel Carter. Please report.
ROBBINS
(over radio)
We've had a bit of a development here, Colonel. According to the
locals, a few days after the culling, another hive showed up. They
didn't kill anybody, they just wanted the surviving villagers to
deliver a message.
CARTER
(into comm)
A message?
ROBBINS
(over comm)
That's right. Apparently, this particular Wraith wants to meet with
Colonel Sheppard.
EXT--VADEENAN PLANET, DAY
[Linara leads the team to her village.]
SHEPPARD
So, you're telling me Davos knew we were coming.
LINARA
He had a vision of your arrival. Before I take you to see him, there
is something you should know. He's very ill. Our healers have done
all that they can, but it's not enough. Some of us were
hoping...well, if you do come from the city of the Ancestors...?
SHEPPARD
We may be able to help.
LINARA
(sighing in relief)
We would be forever in your debt.
TEYLA
He must be very important to you.
LINARA
We owe him our lives. Two years ago, he had a vision that the Wraith
were coming. We had time to gather our provisions and escape to the
caves in the northern mountains. Even from deep underground, we
could hear their ships searching for us. Eventually, they went away
and...never returned. Not a single Vadeenan was taken.
SHEPPARD
Impressive.
LINARA
Of course for me, it's much more than that. He's my father.
INT--DAVOS'S TENT
[Linara and the others arrive. Davos sits in a throne-like chair made
of branches.]
LINARA
Father? The people of Atlantis are here to see you.
DAVOS
Yes. Yes, come in. I've been expecting you, and I know why you're
here.
(he turns to McKay)
You have doubt in your heart.
[Everyone looks at McKay, who shifts uncomfortably.]
MCKAY
Anyone with a basic understanding of body language could've told you
that.
[Davos holds his hand outward.]
DAVOS
Among my gifts is the ability to show others what I can see.
[McKay looks at Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
Well, you're the skeptic.
MCKAY
(resigned)
Fine.
[He steps forward and takes Davos's hand.]
VISION
EXT--MISTY UNNAMED PLANET, DAY
[Sheppard's team walks through the forest. They reach ruins and are
surrounded by Wraith in a standoff.]
END VISION
INT--DAVOS'S TENT
MCKAY
Oh!
SHEPPARD
What happened?
MCKAY
I-I think I just saw a vision.
RONON
Of what?
MCKAY
Of us. Being captured by the Wraith.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Sheppard's team briefs Carter and Woolsey.]
CARTER
You said it was a forested planet, misty, with Ancient ruins.
MCKAY
That's what I saw, yes.
[Carter turns to Woolsey and raises her eyebrows.]
MCKAY
What?
CARTER
While you were gone, we received a report that the people of M2R-441
were recently visited by a Wraith. Now, from the description of his
facial markings, it sounds a lot like the Wraith who helped you
escape from the Genii last year.
SHEPPARD
(surprised)
My old buddy?
CARTER
(nodding)
Apparently, he has a matter of great importance that he wants to
discuss with you. We already sent an advance team to the address
that he proposed for the rendezvous. The interesting thing is it
sounds an awful lot like the planet in McKay's vision.
RONON
(skeptically)
So we're believing this now?
TEYLA
Davos did know we were coming.
CARTER
Did you ask him about the Athosians?
TEYLA
I did not have a chance. After he showed Rodney the vision, he fell
ill.
SHEPPARD
They were hoping we could help him out.
CARTER
I'll send Doctor Keller.
SHEPPARD
In the meantime, there's only one way to know for sure if he's
right. Go to the rendezvous, check it out.
[Carter nods. Woolsey shifts and clears his throat loudly.]
CARTER
(amused)
Do you have something to add, Mister Woolsey?
WOOLSEY
Well, as I said before, I'm here strictly as an observer.
(he hurriedly continues as they begin to rise)
But since you ask, I have to wonder how wise it may be. I may share
some of Doctor McKay's skepticism, but we don't need any mystical
visions to tell us that this Wraith probably can't be trusted.
You're talking about walking deliberately into a trap.
SHEPPARD
Exactly.
[Woolsey turns to the others, who also nod.]
EXT--MISTY UNNAMED PLANET, DAY
[Sheppard's team walks through the forest.]
MCKAY
This is a bad idea.
RONON
You're the one who said it's impossible to see the future.
MCKAY
Yeah, I was thinking about that. I realized that quantum uncertainty
doesn't necessarily preclude of, uh, seeing probable futures. It's
like blackjack. You never know exactly what's gonna happen next,
but, uh, a card counter can certainly increase the odds in his
favor. And frankly, this feels like hitting on an eighteen.
SHEPPARD
It's more like doubling down against a ten.
EXT--RUINS, MISTY UNNAMED PLANET, DAY
MCKAY
Hold on. This is the place. This is where it happened!
[The team is surrounded by Wraith in a standoff.]
TODD
You were supposed to come unarmed.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Sorry about that.
[Two puddle jumpers uncloak above their heads. Todd turns to Sheppard,
who smiles and shrugs.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Carter stands on the balcony by the active Stargate.]
CARTER
(into comm)
How's the patient, Doctor?
INT--DAVOS'S TENT
KELLER
(into comm)
Well, from what I can tell, he...seems to be suffering from a kind
of lymphatic cancer. There's not a lot I can do for him here.
[The rest of this conversation switches between Carter and Keller.]
WOOLSEY
Have you detected any physical anomalies that might be related to
his visions?
(to Carter on her glare)
Sorry, force of habit.
KELLER
Well, I don't really have the equipment with me that's necessary to
make that kind of analysis.
CARTER
All right. Why don't you bring him back?
KELLER
Understood. Um, just so we're clear, are we doing this to try and
save his life, or...to study him?
[Carter glares at Woolsey, who looks away.]
CARTER
I'll have the infirmary prepped and ready for your arrival. Carter
out.
[She storms off. Woolsey discreetly follows.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
[Ronon and Sheppard enter the brig room. The Wraith (Todd) is in the
cell.]
TODD
So much for trust.
RONON
You tried to ambush us.
TODD
I had no intention of causing you harm. But I could not guarantee
your cooperation simply by...throwing myself at your mercy. My
intent was to have this discussion on neutral ground.
SHEPPARD
A discussion?
TODD
The reason for my...contacting you. I require your help. We worked
together once before.
SHEPPARD
Doesn't mean I want to do it again.
TODD
You will.
SHEPPARD
Oh, more predictions. Just what I need.
TODD
As you know, Wraith are at war. I believe you refer to our enemy as
the Replicators.
SHEPPARD
Sounds vaguely familiar.
TODD
Well, we have a weapon. A virus that was designed to reset their
attack directive causing them to stand down and return to their
planet. At present, it is not working.
SHEPPARD
Get to the part where we care.
TODD
It is well known among the Wraith that Doctor McKay made certain
changes to the Replicator base code, opening the door for them to
alter their own programming. Well, knowingly or not, they have since
repaired the weakness our virus exploited. Which means in order to
get it working again, I need to know the changes Doctor McKay made.
SHEPPARD
Now here's the part you're not getting. We're glad they're kicking
your ass.
TODD
Only because you are as yet unaware of their new tactic.
RONON
What are you talking about?
TODD
They realized we have a significant vulnerability. Our food supply.
They have begun to annihilate human worlds.
[Sheppard and Ronon exchange looks.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay brief Carter.]
CARTER
You think he's telling the truth?
SHEPPARD
He gave us an address. Claims it was a human planet the Replicators
destroyed.
CARTER
Is it in the database?
MCKAY
Mmm. M5S-768. We visited it last year. It was a thriving
pre-industrial society.
CARTER
Send a MALP.
MCKAY
Okay.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The MALP goes through the active Stargate.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Woolsey, after watching the MALP leave, heads over to where Carter and
Sheppard's team are crowded around a terminal where McKay is seated.]
MCKAY
Receiving MALP telemetry. Here we go.
[The monitor comes online, showing rubble and darkness.]
MCKAY
No life signs.
WOOLSEY
How do we know the Wraith didn't do that?
MCKAY
The MALP's detecting residual radiation. The energy signature's
consistent with Replicator weapons fire. He's telling the truth.
TEYLA
How many people lived on that planet?
MCKAY
We estimated somewhere between fifty and seventy-five thousand.
[They all react with shock and sorrow.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Linara stands beside the table where her father lies. Keller has a
scanner move over him.]
LINARA
What does the machine do?
KELLER
It scans the cells in his body and reports any abnormalities.
Hopefully, it'll help us figure out exactly what's wrong with him.
LINARA
And then you'll be able to cure him?
KELLER
I'll do my best.
[She shuts the scanner off.]
DAVOS
(sitting up)
You'll have to forgive her, Doctor. She's not used to dealing with
uncertainty. I may have spoiled her in that regard.
KELLER
Yeah, I heard about your gift. It's remarkable.
DAVOS
I can see many things. But unfortunately, my own fate remains hidden
from me.
[Keller looks away as it not wanting to deliver bad news.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay and Sheppard are in his lab.]
MCKAY
If we hadn't deactivated the attack code, this never would've
happened.
SHEPPARD
It was my call, Rodney.
MCKAY
But it was my idea. We had a ZPM, we had Elizabeth. All we had to do
was leave. But I opened my big mouth.
SHEPPARD
You never could've known it was gonna go this way.
MCKAY
No, we don't know that for sure. Look, remember the nanovirus that
caused the fatal aneurysms? I always suspected the Replicators were
behind it.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, but you never proved it.
MCKAY
Yeah, but we know how they feel about the humans. They think we were
a mistake. Look, we should've seen something like this coming.
[Carter and Woolsey enter.]
CARTER
John? Rodney? I know this news is hard for us to accept, but right
now we need to focus. Figure out what our next step is.
MCKAY
I suppose the most obvious solution is to shut down the attack code
again.
WOOLSEY
Can we do that?
MCKAY
It's been done before, just...not by us.
CARTER
By the Wraith.
MCKAY
Yes.
CARTER
And what about our prisoner? What exactly is he proposing?
MCKAY
Well, he claims to have the original virus that deactivated the
attack code the first time. It's not working this time round because
of the changes we made in the Replicator base code. Theoretically,
knowing what we know and knowing what they know, we should be able
to work together to shut them down again.
WOOLSEY
Well, obviously that's out of the question.
[Everyone looks at him.]
WOOLSEY
Do I really have to remind everyone what happened the last time we
cooperated with the Wraith?
CARTER
The circumstances have changed, and what happened to
non-interference?
WOOLSEY
As you said, the circumstances have changed. Colonel Sheppard,
you've had the most experience dealing with the Wraith. Do you
seriously think this is a good idea?
SHEPPARD
I think it's not your call.
WOOLSEY
I need to contact my superiors.
[He walks out.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--CARTER'S OFFICE
[Carter stands in her office. Sheppard enters.]
SHEPPARD
It's just been confirmed. Two more worlds have been destroyed. That
makes three.
CARTER
How many dead?
SHEPPARD
Well, it's just an estimate.
CARTER
How many?
SHEPPARD
A hundred and fifty thousand.
[Carter sighs.]
CARTER
And this is just the beginning, isn't it? There's no reason to
assume they're going to stop.
SHEPPARD
No...What about Woolsey?
CARTER
He's contacted the IOA. They're taking the matter under advisement.
SHEPPARD
Oh, well, they're good at that. They'll bicker and argue, but at the
end of the day, they're gonna leave you holding the bag, just like
they did with Elizabeth.
CARTER
Now I know why you didn't want the job. Look, John, Woolsey was
right about one thing. You have had more experience with the Wraith
than just about anyone. And in particular, with this Wraith. You
have a history.
SHEPPARD
Well, it's not like we're dating.
CARTER
(smiling)
I know we can't trust him, not completely. But what I don't know is
whether or not it's worth the risk to play along with him, at least
for a little while. You're the only one who can answer that.
KELLER
(over comm)
Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller.
CARTER
(into comm)
Go ahead.
KELLER
I've got something you need to see.
CARTER
I'm on my way.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Carter arrives and looks in at Davos. She and Keller are at the other
side of the infirmary by a computer.]
CARTER
How's he doing?
KELLER
Oh, not good. He went into convulsions a while ago. I gave him a
sedative. Truth is, we got him here too late. All I can do right now
is alleviate his symptoms, but whether or not he survives, that's
out of my hands. This is what I wanted you to see.
[She brings up the graphical scan results on a large monitor.]
KELLER
This is the result of his brain scan. He's showing abnormally high
synaptic activity. It's similar to what happened to Doctor McKay
when he encountered that ascension device, only not as extreme. And
in his case, it's not advancing. Presumably he's been like that his
whole life.
CARTER
You're saying he was born this way?
KELLER
He's a genetic accident. One in a million, if not more. Oh, um, by
the way Mister...Woolsey's already asked for a copy of these test
results.
CARTER
(sighing)
I'm sorry, Doctor, but like it or not, this is important
information. He may be a window into our own evolutionary future.
LINARA
Doctor? He's awake.
[They go over to Davos's room.]
KELLER
How're you feeling?
DAVOS
Much better, thank you.
CARTER
Hi, I-I'm Colonel Carter.
DAVOS
You are the leader of these people.
CARTER
Well, the ones on this base, yes.
DAVOS
Not an easy task, I imagine.
[Carter and Keller exchange smiles.]
CARTER
Some days are worse than others.
DAVOS
I understand. I myself was in a position of authority back on my
homeworld.
CARTER
From what I understand, you had a little bit of an advantage.
DAVOS
Believe me, catching glimpses of the future is not always as helpful
as you might think. But there is something you should see.
[He stretches out his hand. Carter steps back.]
CARTER
Uh, you're not feeling well. I think...it's okay. You should rest.
DAVOS
Everything has a purpose, Colonel. Including the circumstances that
brought me here. Please.
[Carter glances at Keller, then takes Davos's hand.]

ship. Several personnel run in panic. The central tower of the city
falls.]

Oh my god!

What is it? What did you see?
[Carter stares in shock at Davos.]
DAVOS
I'm sorry.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--CARTER'S OFFICE
[Woolsey and Sheppard are with Carter in her office.]
WOOLSEY
We should stop trusting that Wraith, now!
SHEPPARD
I'm not buying it.
WOOLSEY
Doctor McKay's vision came true exactly as he saw it.
SHEPPARD
Well, I don't care. The Replicators are not destroying this city,
not if I have anything to say about it!
CARTER
Maybe Rodney's right. Maybe what Davos can see is only a probable
future.
WOOLSEY
Well, his track record's pretty good, so I'd have to say it's highly
probable.
CARTER
Which means it's going to be hard to avoid. For all we know, nine
out of ten courses of action are going to lead to the same fate. Now
unfortunately, the vision I saw had no context to it. We have no way
of knowing why the Replicators were attacking.
WOOLSEY
Isn't it obvious? We're contemplating joining forces with the Wraith
against them.
CARTER
We don't know that that's what causes it.
WOOLSEY
It's a pretty safe assumption. Right now we're not a target.
SHEPPARD
No, no. But the rest of the humans in this galaxy are, and it's our
fault!
WOOLSEY
Nevertheless, our priority remains the safety of this expedition.
And you know as well as I do, the Wraith can't be trusted.
SHEPPARD
This one may be different.
WOOLSEY
(sighing)
Yes, I read the file. He helped you escape from the Genii prison,
and as a reward you let him live. Let's hope we we don't all come to
regret your decision.
[Chuck enters]
CHUCK
Colonel Carter? We've got a problem.
[She leaves with him. Woolsey and Sheppard follow.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
CHUCK
We routinely track a number of hives with our long range sensors.
They don't usually do anything out of the ordinary. Most of the
time, they're just passing through. But a few minutes ago, this one
suddenly changed course. It's headed straight for us.
WOOLSEY
They don't know we're here.
SHEPPARD
They're not supposed to.
[Sheppard leaves.]
INT--BRIG
[Sheppard storms in.]
SHEPPARD
What'd you do?
TODD
What are you referring to?
SHEPPARD
There's a ship on the way!
TODD
Ah, they picked up my signal.
SHEPPARD
What signal?
TODD
Ask your Satedan friend. He's familiar with the technology.
SHEPPARD
A subspace tracking device.
TODD
I had it implanted.
SHEPPARD
We would've detected it.
TODD
I only activated it after you brought me here. The ship is necessary
to complete my plan. The Replicator virus is contained within its
databanks. When it gets here, we may begin our work.
SHEPPARD
Or when it gets here, I'm gonna blow it out of the sky.
[Sheppard starts to leave.]
TODD
Now that would be unwise. That hive is loyal to me. For the moment,
they are the only ones who know the location of Atlantis.
[This news stops Sheppard in his tracks.]
TODD
But if you were to attack them, they will broadcast these
coordinates to every hive ship in the galaxy!
[Sheppard has come back to face Todd through the bars.]
TODD
There is no reason for us to be at odds, John Sheppard. We need each
other.
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Carter and Sheppard enter McKay's lab. He is working on his
computers.]
CARTER
Rodney, we need to know if you can shut down the Replicator attack
code on your own.
MCKAY
I've been looking into that, and it's not very promising.
SHEPPARD
You're the one who activated it in the first place!
MCKAY
Well, that was easy. Well, actually, it was spectacularly difficult,
but then, everything's relative.
CARTER
(admonishing)
Rodney...
MCKAY
Look, the Replicators were originally designed and programmed to do
exactly what they're doing. I mean, they were built for this. It was
much harder for the Wraith to get them to stop then it was for me to
get them to start again.
CARTER
But with this Wraith's help, you think you could do it?
MCKAY
If he really has the original shut-down virus, yeah, I think we can.
[Carter turns to Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
(reluctantly)
He claims he ordered the hive ship not to give away our position
unless they're attacked.
CARTER
Do you believe him?
SHEPPARD
Well, are there any other ships headed this way?
CARTER
No.
SHEPPARD
Then I'd say for the moment, he's telling the truth.
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
[Davos leans against the balcony looking out at the city. Teyla joins
him.]
TEYLA
Doctor Keller told me I might find you here.
DAVOS
She was kind enough to let me go for a little walk. It's quite
something, isn't it?
TEYLA
Yes.
DAVOS
I know I was brought here for a reason...to play a role on a much
bigger stage before I die.
TEYLA
Surely it is not time to start speaking that way?
DAVOS
Doctor Keller is a dedicated and skilled physician, but it doesn't
take a great Seer to know what she is thinking and not saying. My
time is coming to an end.
[Teyla looks away, hesitating to speak.]
DAVOS
You wish to ask me something.
TEYLA
You know why I came to your planet?
DAVOS
To learn the fate of your people.
TEYLA
Yes.
DAVOS
I can tell you only this--they are still alive, but they are
shrouded in darkness. I know you will continue to search for them,
but I'm not sure this burden should be borne by someone in your
condition.
TEYLA
Uh, my condition?
DAVOS
You carry a life inside you, do you not?
[She looks down and smiles slightly.]
TEYLA
Yes.
DAVOS
You conceal it from the others.
TEYLA
It is complicated.
DAVOS
I see. I'm sorry I cannot offer you more.
TEYLA
That is all right. Thank you.
DAVOS
And now you must take me to Colonel Carter.
TEYLA
Yes, of course. This way.
[She starts to help him off the balcony. His breathing gets more
erratic.]
TEYLA
Davos...?
[As soon as they get inside, he collapses. Teyla tries but cannot stop
his fall.]
TEYLA
(into comm)
This is Teyla to the infirmary. I need a medical team now.
[Davos is still conscious, and he desperately clutches Teyla's hand.]

around it.]
WOOLSEY
Teyla's vision only confirms what I've been saying all along.
CARTER
If we destroy the hive ship, we lose our best chance of stopping the
Replicators.
[He stops and stands in front of her.]
WOOLSEY
We may not have a choice. One way or another, events are going to
result in the destruction of that ship.
SHEPPARD
Well, if you believe that, then you believe Atlantis is going to be
destroyed. We might as well pack up our bags and go home. How about
this? We play along. We wait for them to transmit the program to
Rodney's computer. Then, we blow 'em out of the sky.
CARTER
Betray them before they have a chance to betray us?
RONON
They're Wraith. Is anyone going to lose any sleep over this?
CARTER
Rodney, can you guarantee that you could finish the job without the
Wraith's help?
MCKAY
(smugly)
If I have the original virus? Not a problem.
CARTER
(insistently)
Can you guarantee it?
MCKAY
(laughing nervously)
Well, I mean...no.
TEYLA
That is not the only problem. If we do not destroy the hive quickly
enough, it may have time to send a message.
[Woolsey sits and starts to write.]
CARTER
All right, I think I need to meet this Wraith myself. Mister
Woolsey...?
[Carter stands to leave, but waits for Woolsey.]
WOOLSEY
You-you want me to come with you?
CARTER
Well, I'm sure you want your report to the IOA to be as thorough as
possible.
WOOLSEY
(reluctantly)
Of course.
[He follows her.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
WOOLSEY
I've never met a Wraith face-to-face before.
CARTER
Oh, well you're in for a treat.
[The door to the brig opens.]
WOOLSEY
Ladies first.
[Carter looks at him and chuckles then heads inside.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIG
CARTER
Open it.
[The guards turn off the shield and open the door.]
WOOLSEY
Colonel!
CARTER
It's all right.
[She enters the cell, flanked by two guards. Woolsey reluctantly with
her. The Wraith stands.]
CARTER
I'm Colonel Samantha Carter.
TODD
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
[He looks expectantly at Woolsey.]
WOOLSEY
(nervously)
Richard Woolsey.
CARTER
I understand you're proposing that we work together on a joint
venture.
TODD
That is correct.
CARTER
Last time we went down this road, things didn't exactly work out the
way we'd hoped.
TODD
You were betrayed. Believe me, I understand your reluctance.
CARTER
If we do this, we do it our way. Your ship remains in orbit. They
make the slightest false move, and they'll be destroyed.
TODD
Fair enough.
CARTER
The program will be downloaded into a non-networked computer in one
of our labs. All work will be conducted on this base. You will
remain under constant guard. And when you're done, we keep the
virus.
TODD
It won't be easy to upload it into the Replicator network. Are you
sure you're up to the task?
CARTER
We did it before, we'll do it again.
[Todd studies both her and Woolsey.]
TODD
I agree to your terms. You see, I want this as much as you do.
CARTER
Now, let's say that this works. What happens then?
TODD
In my time as a prisoner among the Genii, I lost my position among
Wraith. I still have a few loyal followers but nothing like the
standing I once had.
WOOLSEY
So you're going to use this to leverage your way back in?
TODD
In a manner of speaking.
CARTER
Sooner or later, we're going to end up on opposite sides.
TODD
Yes. But not today. Do we have an agreement?
CARTER
(after a pause)
We do.
TODD
I believe among your people, it is customary to shake hands.
[He extends his feeding hand. The guards raise their weapons, and
Carter reacts slightly. The Wraith laughs.]
TODD
Just a little Wraith humor.
WOOLSEY
(whispering angrily to Carter)
I hope you know what you're doing!
[He leaves. Carter follows.]
EXT--SPACE
[A Wraith ship jumps out of hyperspace and heads to the planet.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Chuck is at his station. Carter, Sheppard, and Woolsey stand nearby.]
CHUCK
A Wraith ship just jumped out of hyperspace.
CARTER
Are they powering weapons?
[Chuck checks his controls.]
CHUCK
(shaking his head)
Negative. They're sending a transmission.
CARTER
(into comm)
Rodney, you're on.
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay and Ronon are there. Several lines of code appear on the
screen.]
RONON
That's it? That's their superweapon?
MCKAY
Well, what were you expecting?
RONON
A big gun? Something that goes boom?
MCKAY
(into comm)
Sam, that's it. We got it.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
I can go down to the Chair Room. Finish this off right now.
CARTER
Can't risk it, John.
(into comm)
Security, have the Wraith escorted to Doctor McKay's lab.
[Woolsey takes a nervous breath.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[The Wraith, shackled with restraints that attach to his waist, and a
security escort have joined McKay there. The Wraith studies the code.]
TODD
(shaking his head)
No. This is all wrong.
MCKAY
What do you mean?
TODD
You must iterate all values of the expression before you can
aggregate the results.
MCKAY
Are you kidding? We're better off using known data points and
extrapolating.
TODD
You risk compounding errors.
MCKAY
What?!
[Todd leans close, indicating his restraints. McKay stiffens and the
guards grow alert.]
TODD
(low, to McKay)
If my hands were free, I could help you.
MCKAY
No, it-it's fine. I'll do it myself, thanks.
TODD
As you wish.
[Todd turns back to the computer. McKay nervously goes back to his
work.]
INT--CARTER'S OFFICE
[Carter and Woolsey are already there when McKay storms in.]
MCKAY
He's holding out on us! Part of the virus is missing. I mean, sure
they're minor subroutines, nothing that would be greatly affected by
the changes I made to the Replicator base code, but
still...necessary to make it work! Look, I probably wouldn't have
even noticed it, except...well, you know, I'm really good. Look,
he's definitely up to something!
WOOLSEY
We know.
MCKAY
You know. What do you mean, you know?
CARTER
A few minutes ago, we started tracking another hive ship on course
for Atlantis.
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Ronon holds his gun at the Wraith. McKay and Sheppard are also there.]
TODD
I swear I know nothing of this.
SHEPPARD
You gave our position away to another hive ship.
TODD
Why would I betray you now? Just as we were beginning to trust each
other?
MCKAY
We're not really, are we? You held back some of the virus.
[The Wraith rears back and smiles slightly.]
TODD
Just a small portion. Nothing that prevents us from completing our
work, and once that is done, I will gladly transmit the remainder.
RONON
I say we kill him right now.
SHEPPARD
I agree.
TODD
I had no way of knowing you would not simply...take the virus and
then turn against me.
SHEPPARD
I'm offended you could even think that.
[The Wraith chuckles ruefully.]
RONON
The point is, you lied. How do we know you aren't lying about the
ship?
TODD
Wraith are divided into many camps. There is much suspicion and
mistrust. The last thing I need is for another hive to appear before
I can complete this work!
MCKAY
(snapping his fingers)
That's it. That's why they're coming. They're tracking his ship.
Think about it. A single hive, off by itself out in the middle of
nowhere orbiting a supposedly uninhabited planet. That's bound to
raise a few eyebrows. I mean...if you had eyebrows.
TODD
There is only one solution. You must cloak the city.
INT--CARTER'S OFFICE
[Sheppard, Woolsey, and Carter are there.]
WOOLSEY
We cloak the city, we lose shields. We'd be completely vulnerable to
attack!
CARTER
And what if he's telling the truth? If we don't cloak, we'll be
giving up our position.
WOOLSEY
He's been playing us from the start. This is what he wanted all
along.
SHEPPARD
All right, wait a minute. A little while ago, you thought the
Replicators were going to destroy the city. Now you think the Wraith
are going to do it. Which one is it?
CARTER
(to Sheppard)
How long until the second hive gets here?
SHEPPARD
Two hours.
[Carter sets her jaw and nods.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Carter arrives at Davos's bedside. Linara is with him.]
CARTER
Hello again.
DAVOS
Colonel! It's nice to see you, but I'm afraid I can't offer you any
more insight into future events. These medicines dull my mind.
CARTER
That's all right. That's not why I came. Although I did want to ask
you a few questions about your visions, if you feel up to it.
DAVOS
Of course.
CARTER
Have you ever been wrong?
DAVOS
No.
CARTER
Knowing how events play out, you haven't been able to change the
future or-or avoid it?
DAVOS
I'm afraid not.
CARTER
What about the culling on your planet?
DAVOS
I did not see a culling, merely the Wraith ships arriving, and that
is exactly what happened. Doctor McKay's vision happened as he saw
it, but his interpretation was incorrect.
CARTER
(with rueful smile)
Pretty hard to misinterpret what I saw.
DAVOS
I make no judgments, but I do know it will come to pass.
CARTER
It's hard for me to accept that. You're telling me that the future
is predetermined, but I have always believed that the future is what
you make it.
DAVOS
Perhaps both are true. Perhaps the future is predetermined by the
character of those who shape it. One thing has been clear to me
since the moment I set foot in this city. The galaxy is at a
crossroads. Never before have I sensed that the future of so many
worlds can turn on the actions of so few.
[Carter sighs nervously.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
EXT--BALCONY, NIGHT
[Sheppard joins Carter on the balcony.]
SHEPPARD
The other hive ship will be here soon.
CARTER
I know. You should get down to the Chair room.
SHEPPARD
So we've decided to take 'em out?
CARTER
Right now, I'm having a hard time deciding anything.
SHEPPARD
You know what the problem is? Too much information.
CARTER
(skeptically)
Really?
SHEPPARD
There's only so much information you need to make a decision.
Anything after that complicates it. Like these visions, are they
making things better or worse?
CARTER
Well, they helped you avoid being captured by the Wraith.
SHEPPARD
No, you and I both know we would never walk into a trap unprepared,
even if McKay didn't have that vision.
CARTER
"The future is predetermined by the character of those who shape
it."
SHEPPARD
What's that?
CARTER
Nothing.
SHEPPARD
Look, technically, Woolsey is correct. The safety of this city is
our first priority, and based on that, there is only one decision.
Take out both the hive ships as soon as possible.
CARTER
But...
SHEPPARD
But...what the hell's the point of being out here if we're not going
to help people? We're going to be safe and sound while the rest of
the galaxy gets slaughtered?
CARTER
So play it safe, or take a chance with the Wraith and maybe save
millions of lives. Th-this kind of decision used to be easy, but
then I was just making it for myself. Now, I'm asking a lot of
people to take a chance with me.
SHEPPARD
Everybody on this base chose to be here, and they did so because
they believe in the same things you do.
CARTER
If anything goes wrong...
SHEPPARD
I'll be ready.
[Carter nods. Sheppard leaves. Carter remains on the balcony, looking
out at the city.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay and other personnel are at various stations. Woolsey stands
observing. Carter enters.]
CARTER
Rodney, prepare to cloak the city.
MCKAY
All right, people, you heard her. Let's do this.
[Woolsey stands flabbergasted as the staff do their jobs. He moves over
to Carter.]
WOOLSEY
My understanding is it takes some doing to switch back from the
cloak to the shields. It's not something that can be done right
away.
CARTER
That's right.
WOOLSEY
So if we commit to this course of action, there's no going back.
CARTER
I'm afraid not. There's still some time before the second hive gets
here. You can return to Midway if you like.
WOOLSEY
But then my report wouldn't be as thorough as possible, would it?
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Sheppard sits in the Ancient chair, activating it.]
SHEPPARD
(into comm)
I'm in position, Colonel.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
(into comm)
Understood.
(to McKay)
Rodney, how we doin?
MCKAY
Engaging cloak...now.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The city disappears.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Davos's breathing becomes more labored. Linara notices.]
LINARA
Father? Father?! Doctor! Doctor, help him!
[Keller rushes over.]
KELLER
Davos? Davos!
LINARA
(crying)
Father?
[The life signs monitor flatlines.]
LINARA
No.
KELLER
I'm sorry.
[Linara takes his hand and sobs.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE NEW LANTIA
[The other hive ship appears near the first one above the planet.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
The second hive just jumped out of hyperspace. This is it...First
hive is sending a transmission. They're probably trying to explain
what they're doing here.
INT--CHAIR ROOM
SHEPPARD
C'mon guys, what's happening?
MCKAY
(over comm)
Stand by.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Rodney...?
MCKAY
They're still just talking. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
We got problem.
SHEPPARD
(over comm)
What is it? Wha-what's going on?
MCKAY
Both ships just powered weapons.
WOOLSEY
Oh my god.
INT--CHAIR ROOM
SHEPPARD
That's it. Firing drones.
[He reaches for the controls.]
CARTER
(over comm)
John, wait.
[Sheppard's hand hovers over the armrest.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
Just...give it a second.
WOOLSEY
Are you insane? They're going to wipe us out!
CARTER
Shut up, Woolsey.
WOOLSEY
(into comm)
Colonel Sheppard, as a ranking representative of the IOA, I'm
assuming command of this base. I'm ordering you to launch the drones
now!
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Sheppard flexes his hands above the controls, uncertain.]
CARTER
(over comm)
Belay that order!
INT--CONTROL ROOM
CARTER
(to Woolsey)
One more word out of you, and I will have you removed!
MCKAY
Hold on, something's happening. The hives are firing on each other.
CARTER
Are you sure?
MCKAY
Definitely. They're not pulling any punches, either.
EXT--SPACE
[The two hive ships do battle. One ship is destroyed. The blast wave
takes out the other ship.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(gasping)
They just destroyed each other. I guess the other Wraith didn't buy
their story.
CARTER
Was either ship able to get off a subspace message?
MCKAY
Oh, right.
[He checks his computer.]
MCKAY
(relieved)
Negative. We-we're good!
[Carter smiles. Woolsey looks away, still unnerved.]
CARTER
(into comm)
John, you can stand down.
INT--CHAIR ROOM
[Sheppard deactivates the chair and sits up.]
SHEPPARD
Gladly.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--INFIRMARY
[Linara watches as they remove her father's corpse from the room. Teyla
is nearby.]
LINARA
I'm taking him back to Vadeena. To be buried according to our
custom.
TEYLA
It is good that he is going home.
LINARA
I don't know what my people will do without him. He's always been
there, warning us of danger, protecting us from harm. Now for the
first time in my life, I fear the future.
[She tears up. Teyla grasps her arm comfortingly.]
TEYLA
Just because something is unknown does not necessarily mean it needs
to be feared. Trust yourself, and the rest will unfold as it is
meant to.
[Linara nods and leaves. Keller comes over.]
KELLER
He was an interesting man.
TEYLA
Yes. He knew that I was pregnant.
KELLER
Really? You know, pretty soon, other people are going to find out,
too. You're gonna have to tell them.
TEYLA
I know.
[She sighs.]
INT--BRIG
[Todd sits on a bench. Several guards surround him as Sheppard comes
near. The Wraith starts to exit the room.]
TODD
So all it took was the destruction of my ship for you to finally
trust me.
SHEPPARD
Oh, not true. I still don't trust you.
(to guards)
Take him to the lab. He's got work to do.
[The guards have restraints ready. The Wraith sighs as he allows
himself to be led away.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Carter waits by the active wormhole. Woolsey walks up, rolling his
case.]
WOOLSEY
Well...this is awkward.
CARTER
(nodding)
Yes.
WOOLSEY
For the record, I thought I was making the right call.
CARTER
It was a difficult situation...for everyone.
WOOLSEY
I just have one last question. How did you know the two Wraith ships
would fire on each other?
CARTER
I didn't.
[Woolsey looks confused.]
CARTER
You going to put that in your report?
WOOLSEY
It probably would be better if I didn't. There may be such a thing
as being...too thorough.
CARTER
Right.
[Woolsey leaves. The wormhole deactivates. Carter smiles, then begins
to walk away. Sheppard arrives and meets her. They walk down the
corridor together.]
SHEPPARD
Where's Woolsey?
CARTER
Oh, you just missed him.
SHEPPARD
That hurts my feelings. I didn't even say goodbye yet.
CARTER
How's McKay doing?
SHEPPARD
He and the Wraith are back at it, but, uh, I guess they're having a
problem getting this virus to work.
CARTER
I'd hate to think this was all for nothing.
SHEPPARD
Well, we got out alive, and we kept our location secret. That still
counts for something.
CARTER
Hmm.
SHEPPARD
Still thinking about those visions, huh?
CARTER
(sighing)
I can't get them out of my head. Everything Davos saw came true!
SHEPPARD
For all we know, then it won't come true for another thousand years!
CARTER
Or it could come true tomorrow!
SHEPPARD
Right. So, what else is new?
