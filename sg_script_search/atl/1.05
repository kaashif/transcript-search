2" are shown.]
TEASER
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL AND GATE ROOM
[The Stargate activated with an incoming wormhole. SFs take defensive
positions around the Stargate. Weir exits her office and heads to the
control room.]
TECHNICIAN
It's Major Sheppard's IDC.
WEIR
They've only been gone a few hours.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Atlantis, this is Sheppard. We're coming in hot.
WEIR
Lower the shield.
[Weir moves to the balcony to watch. The shield lowers. Stunner weapons
blasts strafe the room, making the guards dive for cover. Sheppard's
team runs through the Stargate.]
WEIR
Raise the shield.
[Just before the shield activates, one of the blasts strikes McKay in
the face, knocking him prone.]
SHEPPARD
McKay!
WEIR
Medical team to the gate room.
[Sheppard and Ford roll McKay over; Teyla holds his head. He's
unconscious. Sheppard feels for a pulse.]
SHEPPARD
I got a pulse.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[McKay comes to, but looks groggy. He moves his eyes, but not his head.
One side of his mouth is drooped, and he's slightly drooling. Sheppard
and Beckett are at his bedside.]
SHEPPARD
How are you feeling?
MCKAY
(voice slurred)
I can't feel anything, but...I can't talk.
SHEPPARD
You can't talk, either.
MCKAY
(voice slurred)
That's what I'm trying to say.
BECKETT
Your body experienced a full overload to its sensory and motor
nervous system.
MCKAY
What?
SHEPPARD
You took one of those Wraith stunners right in the face.
BECKETT
It's really quite fascinating, actually. The Wraith weapon impedes
the firing of neurons that enable the necessary--
MCKAY
I'm paralyzed?
BECKETT
(loudly)
The paralysis is only temporary. Don't worry, Rodney. You'll be up
and about in no time.
(to Sheppard, more quietly)
Bloody good thing the Wraith weapons are only designed to
incapacitate, or he'd be dead.
MCKAY
(panicked, but still slurred)
What?
[Weir enters and calls from the doorway.]
WEIR
Major? Could I see you for a second?
[Sheppard leaves. Beckett has already moved on to another patient.]
MCKAY
(slurred)
Hello? Hello?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard walks with Weir.]
SHEPPARD
He's going to be fine.
WEIR
I've heard. I want to know what happened out there.
SHEPPARD
The same old thing.
WEIR
Which makes it the fifth time your team's encountered the
Wraith...out of how many missions?
SHEPPARD
(thinking)
Nine... So probably not a coincidence.
WEIR
I think it's pretty damn obvious now. We've got a spy in Atlantis.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
Sheppard, McKay and Ford are sitting in the conference room. McKay puts
his right foot on the table and starts massaging his stockinged foot.
Sheppard looks at him askance.]
SHEPPARD
Could you please not do that here?
MCKAY
My foot is still numb, if you'll excuse me.
SHEPPARD
At least your mouth still works fine.
[Weir and Bates enter.]
WEIR
(to Bates)
Oh, good.
(to everyone)
All right, let's get started.
[The doors seal closed as she and Bates take their seats.]
FORD
(looking around)
Shouldn't we wait for Teyla?
WEIR
Teyla wasn't invited.
SHEPPARD
She's a member of my team.
BATES
She's also an Athosian, sir.
SHEPPARD
So?
BATES
If we've been compromised, and every indication suggests that we
have, it's almost certain that one of them is responsible.
SHEPPARD
We're talking about Teyla.
WEIR
I don't like it either, Major.
SHEPPARD
(talking over her)
Good, then get her on in here--
WEIR
(continuing)
...But the safety of this base and its personnel are my main concern
right now, as it should be yours. The Wraith have shown up on five
of the last nine planets your team has visited, and given the fact
that two of those worlds were unpopulated, we can pretty much assume
that they're being alerted to your missions by someone on this base.
MCKAY
If someone on this base was communicating with the Wraiths, then why
hasn't Atlantis been attacked?
SHEPPARD
Good point.
BATES
Maybe we should just stop using the Stargate indefinitely.
SHEPPARD
We can't do that.
BATES
Why not?
SHEPPARD
Because we need ZPMs to power this place.
BATES
(blithely)
They seem to be running fine right now.
SHEPPARD
Okay. When the Wraith do show up, and they will, how do we defend
ourselves?
MCKAY
Or for that matter, how do we get back to Earth?
WEIR
This is the only Stargate in the Pegasus galaxy that can even reach
Earth, and if it comes to that, we're going to have to use a
self-destruct before the Wraith take the city.
SHEPPARD
Bottom line, we need to use the gate.
BATES
Then we've got to find out who's responsible A.S.A.P. I suggest we
start by confining all non-base personnel to the south side of the
complex.
SHEPPARD
Are you kidding?
BATES
That's the absolute minimum we should do. If Colonel Sumner was
still here--
SHEPPARD
He's not!
(more calmly, but still stern)
I am.
BATES
Yes, sir.
WEIR
We're not going to start treating anyone like prisoners.
SHEPPARD
Well, that's good.
WEIR
That said, steps should be taken to safeguard the more sensitive
areas of this facility. It's only reasonable.
[Sheppard swallows uncomfortably.]
BATES
I recommend no-go zones start with Stargate operations--the labs,
power generation, and the jumper bay.
WEIR
I'd like to meet with every Athosian on this base. I mean, they've
been here three months. I only know a handful of them by name.
BATES
I could start setting up interviews as soon as we're done here.
WEIR
And in the meantime, all gate travel is suspended until further
notice.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Teyla enters the room and starts to head up the stairwell to the
control room. Two guards stationed half-way up the stairwell stop her.]
GUARD #1
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't come up.
TEYLA
I'm on my way to see Dr. Weir.
GUARD #1
(firmly)
That area is off-limits.
TEYLA
Since when?
[Sheppard jogs down the steps to meet them.]
TEYLA
I believe there's been some sort of misunderstanding.
[She spots McKay and Ford furtively heading across to the control
room.]
TEYLA
(confused)
I...was unaware a meeting had been called.
SHEPPARD
(sighing)
Let's take a walk.
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
TEYLA
What is happening?
SHEPPARD
There may be a security leak on Atlantis.
TEYLA
Are you certain?
SHEPPARD
Well, not "certain" certain... But pretty...certain. It means we're
going to have to take temporary precautions.
TEYLA
Such as?
SHEPPARD
Well, like, uh, suspending gate travel, tightening
security...getting to know your people a little better.
TEYLA
You suspect an Athosian?
SHEPPARD
Dr. Weir wants to meet them, that's all. It's not personal.
Well...well, I mean, it is in the sense that she wants to meet them
all personally--
TEYLA
(interrupting)
You're aware of the horrors generations of my people have faced at
the hands of the Wraith, and yet you would still question their
loyalty?
SHEPPARD
Come on, Teyla, that's not fair. You've got people running around
Atlantis that she's never even met.
TEYLA
I know each and every one of them. I would stake my life on their
innocence.
SHEPPARD
Okay. Well, perhaps you've noticed, but every time we step through
the Stargate, bad guys try to kill us. And I'm getting a little
tired of it. How about you?
TEYLA
That does not mean--
SHEPPARD
(cutting her off)
Look...all we're asking for is a little cooperation, that's all.
[Teyla looks furious, but Sheppard continues to give her a pleading
expression.]
TEYLA
(coldly)
You shall have it.
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Weir and Halling sit across from each other in a small conference
room. Bates observes while another military member transcribes the
conversation.]
WEIR
Halling. How's Jinto?
HALLING
Well enough for a boy confined to his living quarters.
WEIR
I'm sorry. It's temporary, but it is a necessary precaution.
HALLING
So I've heard.
WEIR
Then I assume you know why we've arranged these meetings?
HALLING
For the same reason my people can no longer go off-world or enter
parts of the city. You no longer trust us.
WEIR
The truth, Halling...we don't know who to trust. Information
regarding some off-world excursions has obviously found its way to
the Wraith.
HALLING
Obviously?
WEIR
They can't be lying in wait in every corner of this galaxy. They are
tracking our movements, and we need to find out how. Your help with
this would be greatly appreciated.
HALLING
Then by all means, how can I be of assistance?
WEIR
Thank you.
BATES
Since you've been here on Atlantis, you've been off-world three
times?
HALLING
Yes. I've been acting as a guide on behalf of Sergeant Stackhouse's
reconnaissance team, helping to establish relations between your
people and some of our former trading partners.
WEIR
Stackhouse reported he lost track of you on a couple of these
outings?
HALLING
I did take the time to visit some close friends.
BATES
Interesting. Two of your three "visits" predated Wraith attacks by
approximately a day.
WEIR
(admonishing)
Sergeant.
HALLING
What are you suggesting?
BATES
(with false innocence)
I'm not suggesting anything.
HALLING
You think I would betray my own people? Jeopardize the life of my
son?
WEIR
No one is making accusations.
HALLING
I disagree. You've already leapt to the conclusion that an Athosian
is responsible.
BATES
(scoffing)
Because it can't possibly be one of our own people.
HALLING
No?
[Bates quails under Halling's look and turns to Weir, who is also
glaring at him.]
WEIR
(diplomatically, to Halling)
We just need to clarify a few things.
HALLING
Then allow me. I lost my closest friend in the Wraith attack that
forced us from our home-world. Selana, the woman you spoke to before
me, lost both her parents. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find
an Athosian who has not experienced loss at the hands of the Wraith!
These are the people you accuse.
WEIR
We are not accusing anyone.
HALLING
And I came here expecting an interview.
(he stands)
Not an interrogation.
[He leaves. Bates and Weir exchange frustrated looks.]
INT--JUMPER BAY
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Zelenka and McKay work in the rear compartment of a jumper.]
ZELENKA
I mean, I don't think it's too much to ask.
MCKAY
What is it?
ZELENKA
Nothing, nothing. I just cannot bear the same meal day after day
after day.
MCKAY
Well, buck up a little. I'm trying to run a diagnostic.
ZELENKA
Sorry.
MCKAY
I mean, we are stranded with limited resources in another galaxy. I
mean, come on, the nearest Bob's Big Boy is 300 million light years
away. We have to make do. If that means you have to eat my favorite
food two days in a row, so be it.
ZELENKA
You enjoy military rations?
MCKAY
(absently)
I know. It's weird. Hospital food, too. The only reason I don't like
airplane food is you can't get seconds, and I'm an absolute--
[His computer beeps.]
MCKAY
Hello.
ZELENKA
What is it?
MCKAY
It's a command subroutine I've never seen before.
ZELENKA
What is its function?
MCKAY
(petulant)
I don't know, because I've never seen it before. Okay, I'm going to
cross-reference this with the, uh, Ancient database up in the
control room. I'm just going to grab the, uh...
[McKay starts to leave. Zelenka reaches for the monitor display hanging
from the cables. Just after he touches it, a mechanical humming sound
starts over their heads. McKay hurries back.]
MCKAY
What did you touch?
ZELENKA
(backing away, innocent)
Nothing, nothing.
MCKAY
You were just...
ZELENKA
No, no, no--
[There is a louder hum and McKay and Zelenka race out of the jumper to
track its source.]
INT--JUMPER BAY
[They look up to see the roof has retracted and the sun is shining
directly down on them from the opening to the sky.]
MCKAY
I had no idea the roof could do that.
ZELENKA
Neither did I.
INT--ATHOSIAN QUARTERS
[A group of Athosians, including Halling, sit in the room.]
ATHOSIAN #1
The gate room and surrounding sections have been closed to us.
ATHOSIAN #2
And we may no longer have access to the medical facility without
escort. We're under constant surveillance, our movements restricted.
ATHOSIAN #1
How long must we put up with this?
HALLING
It's already been too long.
[The door opens and Teyla enters.]
TEYLA
I would have expected to be included in this discussion.
HALLING
As we would have expected you to take a stand in our defense.
TEYLA
They have taken action to protect everyone on this base. That
includes each and every one of you. The presence of a Wraith
collaborator threatens us all.
HALLING
Then you support Dr. Weir's decision to confine us?
TEYLA
Halling, we are their guests.
HALLING
We've become more like their prisoners... But unlike prisoners, we
can choose to leave.
TEYLA
Where would you go?
HALLING
Do you not mean to say, "Where would we go?"
[Teyla is taken aback.]
HALLING
We have friends on other worlds who would gladly take us in.
TEYLA
For how long? Good trading partners do not necessarily make good
hosts.
HALLING
There are many worlds among the stars.
TEYLA
The Wraith have awakened. No world is safe.
HALLING
Nor is it safe to remain. They will continue to do this until they
find someone to blame.
TEYLA
You know in your heart that none of our people could be responsible
for this!
HALLING
Of course.
TEYLA
(insistently)
Then we have nothing to fear.
HALLING
You trust Dr. Weir that much?
TEYLA
I do.
HALLING
More than you would trust your own people?
TEYLA
No! I understand her responsibility. Halling, we have met with the
Wraith off-world so often and so quickly. There must be a reason
beyond coincidence. Give them a chance to find it.
[Halling sits. They all look abashed, but still troubled.]
TEYLA
I do not approve of some of their measures, but I do know that in
the end, they will help to prove our innocence. Atlantis is far more
than shelter. It is hope! Not only for our people, but for everyone
who would stand against the Wraith. We must not abandon that hope.
HALLING
They may reside here, Teyla, but they're not the Ancestors, no
matter how much you wish them to be.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Ford runs to catch up to Sheppard. Ford carries a large paper bag in
one hand.]
FORD
Sir!
SHEPPARD
Ford.
FORD
I heard they got the sun-roof open on the jumper bay.
SHEPPARD
Yep.
FORD
I also heard you're planning to take a jumper out.
SHEPPARD
I figure that's what the door in the roof is for.
FORD
Anyone else call shotgun?
SHEPPARD
(casually)
I was just going to drive around the planet, check it out.
FORD
(with mock casualness)
Oh, you're just checking out the planet? Uh, never mind, then.
That's cool. I mean, I've got better things to do than cruise around
a planet in a space ship.
SHEPPARD
You're like a kid, you know that?
FORD
(grinning)
Yes, sir. I brought along something to eat on the ride.
SHEPPARD
What's that?
[Ford holds up the bag.]
FORD
How about a nice...turkey sandwich?
[Sheppard shakes his head, relenting.]
SHEPPARD
Let's go.
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
WEIR
Send in whoever's next, please.
[The guard opens one panel of the room to find Teyla standing outside.
Weir stands and smiles.]
WEIR
Teyla...I wasn't expecting you.
TEYLA
I was surprised to be left off your list.
WEIR
I didn't feel it was necessary in your case.
TEYLA
(sitting)
On the contrary. You should have spoken to me first.
WEIR
You're right. I should have.
TEYLA
I can tell you anything you need to know about my people.
BATES
Is it possible you don't know them all as well as you think?
[Teyla barely spares Bates a glance before turning back to Weir.]
TEYLA
I empathize with you, Dr. Weir. As leaders, we are often forced to
make difficult decisions in the interests of those we serve, but
many of my fellow Athosians are not so... understanding.
WEIR
I know, but there's nothing I can do about that now. People can
suspect my motives for these meetings all they want, but you and I
need to agree that we have a problem. I have to do whatever I can to
get to the bottom of it.. And right now, that means sitting down and
talking with every single person here.
TEYLA
You should know there is talk of leaving Atlantis.
WEIR
(surprised)
I hope it doesn't come to that.
[Teyla stands.]
TEYLA
Not all change is for the worse.
INT--JUMPER BAY
[The roof retracts.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Ford and Sheppard are in the jumper.]
SHEPPARD
Flight, this is Jumper Three. We're go for bay launch.
TECHNICIAN
(over radio)
Jumper Three, you're good to go.
SHEPPARD
Yes, we are.
INT--JUMPER BAY
[The jumper rises vertically through the roof and flies off.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
It's strange not pulling any Gs.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. I kind of miss it. Although at this rate of acceleration we'd
be dead by now.
FORD
Yeah?
SHEPPARD
Oh, yeah. Without inertial dampening, we'd be hit by so many Gs, our
eyes would pop, the skin would pull away from our faces, our brains
would squish up to the back of our skulls, and our internal organs
would be crushed into these chairs. What about that sandwich?
[Ford gives Sheppard a nauseated look before tossing him the bag.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Flight, we're going to take a low orbit around the planet. We'll
advise when we're back in radio range.
TECHNICIAN
(over radio)
Copy that, Jumper Three. Good luck.
FORD
You know, we still haven't named the planet yet.
SHEPPARD
I'm sure the Ancients have a name for it.
FORD
How about "Atlantica" or something like that?
SHEPPARD
I thought we agreed you weren't going to name anything anymore.
[Ford shoots Sheppard a look, but then is distracted by the view
through the window.]
FORD
Sir. Is that...land?
[Sheppard also looks at where the Jumper is in low orbit above the
planet.]
SHEPPARD
(amazed)
Yes. It is.
FORD
I wonder how big it is.
[The heads up display (HUD) automatically appears before them showing
the dimensions of the continent.]
SHEPPARD
Big.
FORD
Really big.
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Ford and Sheppard are reporting to Weir and Bates. McKay walks behind
them.]
FORD
It's huge.
MCKAY
Define "huge."
SHEPPARD
Fifteen million square miles. Well, give or take.
MCKAY
That would make it approximately the size of, uh... I have no idea,
but it sounds huge.
WEIR
How long would it take us to get there?
SHEPPARD
Twenty-five minutes by jumper, ground to ground. I saw some sweet
breakers on the south tip. There may be surfing in our future.
BATES
We should send a team to go get soil and water samples.
MCKAY
He's right. If the land's arable, it could solve a lot of our food
production problems.
BATES
Actually, I was thinking of something else.
SHEPPARD
Not surfing?
BATES
No, sir. We can't resume off-world missions as long as the Athosians
remain in the city.
SHEPPARD
So you want to dump 'em on the mainland?
BATES
It's not like we're sending them out there to die, Major.
SHEPPARD
Well, how the hell would you know?
FORD
It looked pretty wild down there.
BATES
A second ago, we were going surfing.
SHEPPARD
Well, that was after we check for monsters and...bugs and other
space-related things.
BATES
I can't imagine it would be any worse than their original
home-world.
MCKAY
(dryly)
That could just be failure of imagination on your part.
BATES
(undaunted)
In any case, a survey would tell us what we need to know.
SHEPPARD
(to Weir)
You're not seriously thinking about this. We're the reason they had
to leave their planet in the first place.
WEIR
This is a complicated situation, Major.
SHEPPARD
Well, what does that mean?
WEIR
It means I'm not about to rule anything out at this point.
[Sheppard stares in disbelief.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir walks down a corridor. Halling and some other Athosians
approach.]
HALLING
Dr. Weir? Is it true you've discovered land on this world?
WEIR
Yes, it is.
HALLING
Then my people wish to take our leave to explore it.
WEIR
(surprised)
You would?
HALLING
We're no longer welcome here.
WEIR
That's not the case.
HALLING
And it will make us useful as long as we have no access to the gate.
WEIR
We don't even know if it's safe.
HALLING
We can determine that...for both our people.
WEIR
I don't get it. Up until now, you've been insisting on access to the
Stargate, and now you're proposing to deliberately cut yourself off
from it?
HALLING
We cannot leave...and we cannot stay. The mainland presents us with
a third option.
WEIR
I see.
HALLING
You said yourself this was a temporary measure.
WEIR
Yes, of course.
HALLING
You have the means to assure us passage between Atlantis and the
mainland when you decide to resume use of the gate.
WEIR
And if we resume our missions through the Stargate and stop
encountering the Wraith at every turn, it will only prove that there
is a spy among the Athosians.
HALLING
And when you continue to encounter the Wraith at every turn, it will
only prove our innocence.
WEIR
Have you discussed this with Teyla?
HALLING
(after a pause)
Teyla has made her decision.
[The Athosians walk away.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN
INT--ATHOSIAN QUARTERS
[Several Athosians finish packing. The door opens. Teyla stands at the
entrance, wearing an Atlantis uniform.]
HALLING
I understand you're not coming with us.
[The other Athosians notice their expressions and leave them alone.]
TEYLA
Dr. Weir has arranged for communications between Atlantis and the
mainland should you ever need assistance.
HALLING
Thank her for us.
TEYLA
I hope...I don't want anyone to believe that I'm--
HALLING
(admonishing)
Teyla. The time has come.
[She steps forward and they touch foreheads in the Athosian manner.]
HALLING
Go safely.
TEYLA
And you.
[They look at each other sadly, and Teyla leaves, hesitantly looking
back.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[From the catwalk, Teyla watches her people heading to the shuttle
bay.]
TEYLA
I've never been separated from my people before.
WEIR
It must be hard, but you know you'll see them again.
TEYLA
Do you doubt that you will one day return to Earth?
WEIR
I can't afford to have doubts.
TEYLA
(sighing)
You mean you cannot afford to let them show.
WEIR
You're still a leader, Teyla. You're doing this for your people and
for their future. They know that.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard's team, including Teyla, is geared up for a mission. So is
another team led by Stackhouse. Weir and other scientists stand ready.]
WEIR
Anxious to step through the gate again, Major?
SHEPPARD
Yes, I am.
TEYLA
We all are.
SHEPPARD
Would you like us to bring you back anything special?
WEIR
No, thanks.
SHEPPARD
Groceries? A new outfit? Flatware?
WEIR
Hmm. No. Just yourselves in one piece, please.
(to technician)
Dial it up.
(to Sheppard)
Be safe.
[The Stargate activates and the two teams step through.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--CLEARING, DAY
[The two Atlantis teams monitor the area, which is deserted except for
fallen stone ruins.]
SHEPPARD
Well? Good stuff?
DR. CORRIGAN
I can't even begin to tell you how fascinating this is.
SHEPPARD
Anthropologist fascinating or actual fascinating?
DR. CORRIGAN
Yeah, well, maybe "fascinating" isn't the right word.
SHEPPARD
Maybe not. How much longer?
DR. CORRIGAN
Realistically, we're probably going to need to come back. There's
just, uh, so much here.
SHEPPARD
Oh, I can see that. Is there any way to speed things up?
DR. CORRIGAN
Well, sure. Find me someone who can translate some of the runes.
SHEPPARD
Did you say there were natives here?
TEYLA
They're a very shy people. They probably went into hiding the moment
we came through the gate.
SHEPPARD
Is there any way you can coax them out, have them give us a hand?
TEYLA
It is unlikely, but I could try.
SHEPPARD
Lieutenant, go with her.
TEYLA
It would be better if I went alone.
SHEPPARD
You will be alone...with Lieutenant Ford.
[Teyla shoots him a wry smile but goes with Ford. Sheppard watches them
leave with a sigh.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Teyla and Ford wander through the woods.]
TEYLA
Illa! Illa a-na-ve! Illa! Illa a-na-ve!
[She continues the calls as they walk further.]
FORD
Maybe they're not around.
TEYLA
They are near, but you are a stranger to them. They will not come
out of hiding so long as you are with me. They are not a dangerous
people, Lieutenant. I will be fine.
[Ford studies her for a while, then nods.]
FORD
All right. I'll wait here.
[Teyla starts walking away.]
TEYLA
Illa. Illa.
FORD
Call me on the radio if you need me.
EXT--CLEARING, DAY
[A Wraith passes in the foliage. Sheppard turns thinking he spots
something, just in time to see several warriors running towards them
firing stunners.]
SHEPPARD
Wraith!
[He starts providing cover fire as the science team scrambles.]
SHEPPARD
Get back to the gate, now!
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Ford hears the gunfire in the distance.]
EXT--CLEARING, DAY
[The science team takes cover behind the stone columns as they return
fire against the Wraith.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
FORD
(calling out)
Teyla!
(into radio)
Major, what's the situation?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Lieutenant, we're taking...
EXT--CLEARING
[The conversation continues to switch between the clearing and forest.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
... fire. You're going to have to circle around to get back to the
gate.
FORD
Teyla's not with me. She went to--
SHEPPARD
(cutting him off)
Well, find her and get yourselves back.
[Ford runs off.]
[Sheppard downs one of the Wraith.]
SHEPPARD
Move out!
[He knocks another Wraith to the ground with more fire and then starts
to run. The Wraith stands back up and fires his stunner, hitting
Sheppard in the shoulder. Sheppard collapses with a cry. Stackhouse and
another team member provide cover fire as they return for Sheppard.]
STACKHOUSE
Yamato, McKay, grab the Major.
MCKAY
What about Teyla and Ford?
STACKHOUSE
Now!
[McKay and Yamato drag Sheppard back while Stackhouse and another team
member continue to provide cover fire.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[A medical team, Weir, and guards greet Stackhouse and Sheppard's
teams. Sheppard lies on the floor. Teyla and Ford do not return.]
STACKHOUSE
Shut it down. They're right behind us.
[The Stargate shuts down. Medics rush to Sheppard, getting him on the
gurney.]
MEDIC
Okay, on three. One, two, three.
[They raise the gurney. The medical team rolls Sheppard away.]
MCKAY
(to Weir)
We have to go back.
WEIR
Teyla? Lieutenant Ford?
MCKAY
They're still on the planet. We have to go back now.
STACKHOUSE
I'd advise against it. You have Wraith all over the pl--
MCKAY
(interrupting)
We can't just leave them there.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir speaks to Stackhouse and McKay, who is still pacing impatiently.
The room is crowded with personnel, including Sergeant Bates.]
WEIR
How many?
STACKHOUSE
It's hard to say. Most of them were behind the tree line.
MCKAY
We're wasting time here. We need to mount a rescue operation.
WEIR
I am not going to send anyone through that gate until I have all the
facts, Doctor. How did Teyla and Lieutenant Ford get separated from
you?
STACKHOUSE
They went to check out the area, try to make contact with some of
the natives.
BATES
And whose idea was that?
[Sheppard enters, dressed in civilian shirt and uniform pants.]
SHEPPARD
Mine. She was following my orders.
WEIR
Shouldn't you be back in the infirmary?
SHEPPARD
(groaning as he sits)
No, I'm fine. I didn't take a full blast.
WEIR
Why didn't you go with them, Major?
SHEPPARD
Well, the natives of that planet are easily spooked. Teyla thought
we'd scare them off with a big group.
BATES
(sneering)
Teyla did.
SHEPPARD
What's that, Sergeant?
BATES
She was conveniently absent during the ambush.
MCKAY
So was Ford! Maybe it was him.
BATES
I'm just stating a fact, sir.
SHEPPARD
(standing)
Sergeant, I am only going to say this once--
BATES
With all due respect, Major, you can reprimand me if you wish, but
it's been six times your team's been compromised. Only one Athosian
knew about this last mission.
[They stand toe to toe for a few seconds, interrupted by the Stargate
activating with an incoming wormhole.]
TECHNICIAN
We have an unscheduled off-world activation. It's Teyla's IDC.
Receiving a radio transmission.
TEYLA
(over radio, frantic)
This is Teyla. Lieutenant Ford has been wounded. The Wraith are
closing in on our position.
BATES
(to Weir)
You put down that shield, and we could be opening this base up to a
Wraith attack.
TEYLA
(over radio)
Atlantis, please, let us through.
[Guards set up down in the Gate room.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Lieutenant Ford, can you confirm the situation?
TEYLA
(over radio)
He is unconscious. Our situation grows desperate. Soon we will have
no choice but to go through the stargate.
BATES
We drop that shield and who knows what she'll bring through that
gate with her.
SHEPPARD
(furious)
Open up the damn gate!
[Weir stares at them both, looking very troubled.]
WEIR
Lower the shield.
[Teyla drags Ford through the Stargate. It shuts down behind her. She
turns to find herself surrounded by the guards, aiming their weapons at
her.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Sheppard, Weir, and Bates are in the room.]
SHEPPARD
If she were helping the Wraith, why bother bringing Ford back? In
fact, why bother coming back at all?
BATES
She's of more use to them here in Atlantis. As for apparently
rescuing Lieutenant Ford--
SHEPPARD
She carried him through the damn gate. What's "apparent" about that?
BATES
He's unconscious, sir. We still don't know what happened.
SHEPPARD
Oh, that's enough.
BATES
It's my job to express security concerns, sir.
SHEPPARD
I've heard enough of your concerns.
BATES
Again, with all due respect, Major, I believe you're putting your
personal feelings--
SHEPPARD
(fuming)
You're dismissed.
BATES
Yes, sir.
[He slams his folders closed and storms out of the room. Sheppard
paces, then notices Weir watching him.]
SHEPPARD
(surly)
What?
WEIR
I'm the one who put him in charge of security.
SHEPPARD
Yes, you did, and if you want to dismiss me, go ahead.
WEIR
Why don't you go and see how Lieutenant Ford is doing?
[Sheppard leaves.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Bates empties Teyla's pack onto McKay's counter. McKay watches him,
arms crossed.]
MCKAY
(angrily)
You want me to go through her stuff?
BATES
We're looking for weapons, transmitters, recording devices...
anything that looks like it's beyond the Athosians' level of
technology.
MCKAY
(snide)
And if I don't find anything, we move on to a strip search?
BATES
Just do it.
[Bates glares and leaves. McKay sighs and starts work.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Ford and Sheppard sit side by side on an infirmary bed.]
FORD
We were on our way back when we came under fire. Didn't even see
them. We returned fire, then broke for the gate. I was hit from
behind. She saved my ass back there, Major.
SHEPPARD
Of course she did.
[McKay nervously and quickly heads to Sheppard.]
MCKAY
Major, I, uh...oh, Ford, how are you feeling? Pins and needles all
over?
[Sheppard nudges Ford's knee.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, yeah, welcome to the club.
FORD
(embarrassed)
No, sir, I managed to dive out of the way of the stunner blast. I
must've hit my head on the way down.
MCKAY
Oh.
SHEPPARD
Hit your head?
MCKAY
Major, I need you to see something.
[Sheppard follows McKay out.]
FORD
(calling after them)
I-I'll be fine.
INT--MCKAY'S OFFICE
[Sheppard and McKay enter. Sheppard spots Teyla's belongings scattered
around the countertop.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell is this?
MCKAY
I know how it looks. Special request from Sergeant Bates.
SHEPPARD
(angry)
I'm going to bust that son of a bitch.
MCKAY
Major--
SHEPPARD
Teyla has nothing to do with this.
MCKAY
The thing is...he was right.
SHEPPARD
(nonplussed)
Bates was right?
MCKAY
I know. I was as surprised as you are. Look at this. It's her
locket. It's a transmitter. It's been broadcasting a continuous
signal. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it
specifically.
[Sheppard stares at the necklace McKay is holding up. He huffs and
shakes his head.]
SHEPPARD
I found it.
MCKAY
(nonplussed)
What?
SHEPPARD
Back on her planet, the first time we met Teyla took me to the old
ruins. That was half-buried in dirt. I gave it to her.
FLASHBACK
INT--CAVE, ATHOS
[Sheppard picks up the locket which is sparkling in the torchlight. He
shows it to Teyla, who is startled. She gasps.]
TEYLA
I lost this years ago.
END FLASHBACK
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Sheppard, McKay and Bates are with Weir. Weir holds the necklace. A
laptop displays a schematic of it.]
MCKAY
The locket isn't powerful enough to send a signal very far,
certainly not through subspace. Now, my guess is that there are
probably relay devices on certain planets that pick up the
transmission and then alert the nearest hive ship. Those were the
planets where we were attacked.
SHEPPARD
Boy, do we owe a few people an apology.
[He glares at Bates.]
WEIR
Teyla had no idea she was giving away your position?
SHEPPARD
She said it was a present from her father. She lost it when she was
a kid.
MCKAY
It was probably dormant until Major Sheppard picked it up,
activating it.
BATES
If she wore it as a kid, how come they weren't attacked back then?
MCKAY
Didn't I just say it was dormant?
BATES
But if it was activated by touch...
MCKAY
You're not listening. I said Major Sheppard activated it.
WEIR
As far as the Wraith are concerned, Teyla's just another human
being.
MCKAY
They would have no special interest in tracking her. Now, Major
Sheppard, on the other hand...
WEIR
Has the Ancient gene.
MCKAY
Exactly. Now, at one point, the Wraiths and the Ancients were at
war. The Wraiths created a transmission device to detect Ancients.
SHEPPARD
So some Athosian thought this would make a nice little necklace?
MCKAY
How could I possibly know that? What am I, Answer Man? The point
is--
WEIR
(interrupting)
It wasn't Teyla... Or any other Athosian, for that matter.
SHEPPARD
If that's the case...we can use it against them.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[McKay nervously places an ammunition box on the counter. Sheppard and
Ford watch.]
SHEPPARD
You seem nervous.
MCKAY
No, I'm a part of this team. I'm doing this.
SHEPPARD
Yes, you are. I just said you seemed nervous.
MCKAY
Oh, really? I thought you said, "Rodney, you don't have to do this."
SHEPPARD
Yes, you do.
MCKAY
Damn right I'm doing this, despite the fact that feeling hasn't
completely returned to my extremities.
[Teyla enters.]
SHEPPARD
You're late.
TEYLA
Sorry.
FORD
Now, given the Wraith's regenerative abilities, killing one requires
some amount of effort. Capturing one live is going to be a whole
other deal. For any of these options to work, your Wraith has to be
on the ground.
MCKAY
The last planet we visited was inaccessible by ship, and the, uh,
ruins around the Stargate should force the Wraith to come through on
foot.
[Ford opens one of the ammunition boxes.]
FORD
In which case, you'll be able to use these. This is a stun grenade.
It's filled with a mixture of aluminum and potassium perchlorate
that, when ignited, produces a high-pressure wave that will
overwhelm the intended target with intense light and sound. If that
doesn't get his head ringing, in addition...you've got your taser.
With a range of between 15 to 20 feet, it delivers a high-voltage,
low-amperage charge that mimics the body's electrical signals,
temporarily paralyzing the victim.
EXT--CLEARING, DAY
[Sheppard's team set the trap, then lie in wait, weapons ready.]
FORD
(over radio)
Major, this is Ford.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
What have you got, Lieutenant?
[From across the clearing, Ford watches the Stargate from his own
position through binoculars.]
FORD
We've got company...Four of them.
[Sheppard peeks around the corner of the ruined wall where he is hiding
and sees the four Wraith warriors spreading out from the Stargate.]
SHEPPARD
All right, then we go as planned.
FORD
Yes, sir.
[Sheppard turns to McKay next to him. McKay is agitatedly cradling his
P-90.]
SHEPPARD
(to McKay)
You still seem nervous.
MCKAY
(nervously)
No, it's good, it's good. I'm all good. All good.
[In the clearing, the lead Wraith bends down and picks up the pendant
lying on the ground. He airily looks around.]
SHEPPARD
(quietly into radio)
Teyla...
[He peeks around the other side of the wall to see Teyla's position. He
gives her hand signals, and she nods in acknowledgement, hitting the
detonator on the explosives. Caught by surprise, the Wraith are trying
to get away from this attack when Sheppard and McKay start shooting
from their position. Teyla and Ford also shoot their warrior. Teyla
breaks cover to continue firing until her weapon jams.]
[Sheppard and McKay down one of the warriors, but he starts to get back
up. Stackhouse's team break cover to help corral the other Wraith.]
STACKHOUSE
This one's ours, boys. Tasers.
[Teyla runs to meet the others, discarding her useless rifle. She
notices the lead Wraith sneaking away and gives chase.]
[Sheppard, McKay, Stackhouse and one of his team surround the Wraith
and all fire tasers at him. The Wraith drops to the ground.]
[Teyla starts shooting the lead Wraith with her Beretta. The Wraith
keeps coming, finally knocking her back bodily. She instantly gets to
her feet and grabs a nearby stick, twirling it expertly.]
[Sheppard's team warily approach the downed Wraith. They notice a
device blinking on the warrior's chest.]
SHEPPARD
It's a self-destruct! Take cover!
[Everyone dives towards the ruins as the warrior explodes into
nothing.]
[Elsewhere, Teyla uses her weapon to fight the Wraith.]
[From Ford's position, he sees the aftermath of the warrior's
self-destruct, but can see none of his team through the smoke.]
FORD
Major! Dr. McKay!
[Pieces of Wraith fall around McKay and Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
(to McKay)
You okay?
MCKAY
(with irony)
I'm fine. This is...this is fun for me.
[He groans and rolls over as Sheppard gets up, holding the warrior's
stunner.]
[Teyla uses two sticks, but her moves become more desperate. The Wraith
finally knocks her down, instantly seizing on his advantage. He raises
his hand to feed, but is downed by a Wraith stunner blast fired by
Sheppard. He reaches towards a device on his wrist, but Sheppard knocks
his hands apart with the tip of the stunner weapon and holds one arm
down with his foot.]
SHEPPARD
Easy. Don't go blowing yourself up.
[Teyla and Sheppard exchange looks.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir exits a room to see Teyla passing by, wearing full Athosian
gear.]
WEIR
Teyla. Excuse me. I was hoping to catch you before you headed back
to the mainland. I hear they're doing well.
TEYLA
Very well. According to Halling, they're busily planting crops for
the next harvest.
WEIR
I'm glad to hear it.
TEYLA
I will tell them what has happened. Hopefully, in time, we will all
be able to put the events of the past week behind us.
WEIR
Yes. I am aware that the last few days have been particularly
difficult for you.
TEYLA
I believe, Dr. Weir, that in your place, I would have done the same.
WEIR
Thank you.
[Teyla smiles and nods, then leaves.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DUSK
INT--ATLANTIS PRISON CELL
[Sheppard paces around the outside of the cell. It is a cube with
horizontal thick shelves as bars and an invisible energy shield. The
Wraith stands in the center of the cell.]
MALE WRAITH
Again? Your kind is persistent. I would have thought you'd have
given up by now.
SHEPPARD
Well, hell, I've got all the time in the world. Now, you, on the
other hand...
[The Wraith stalks towards Sheppard and tries to grab him, but is
repelled by the energy shield.]
SHEPPARD
The Ancients were pretty good at shields and stuff like that,
weren't they?
[The Wraith grunts.]
SHEPPARD
I give you a week... Maybe two, tops.
MALE WRAITH
You waste your time. I will provide you with no information.
SHEPPARD
I wonder what hurts more, the gunshot wound or the hunger... because
I'd love to help out, but how did McKay put it? "We can't meet your
dietary requirements."
MALE WRAITH
When I'm free, you'll be the first that I feed upon.
SHEPPARD
(unconcerned)
Okey-dokey. I'm going to go make myself a sandwich.
MALE WRAITH
Human. You think you've won a victory by my capture, but by bringing
me here, you've only hastened your own doom. It's only a matter of
time before the others of my kind come to rescue me, and when they
do, there will be nowhere in this world you can hide.
SHEPPARD
(with mock sympathy)
Stay positive, now.
FADE OUT
