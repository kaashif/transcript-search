TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY
[A puddle jumper flies through the air.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard flies Zelenka and Ronon back to Atlantis.]
SHEPPARD
Well? How'd the camping go?
ZELENKA
Oh, splendid. I was able to run several ground-penetrating radar
tests. You know, to test the dielectric permittivity of the region's
subsurface.
SHEPPARD
(blankly)
Sweet.
(to Ronon)
What about you? How was the hunting?
RONON
(annoyed)
If there was any game, it was all scared off by the noises his
stupid machines made.
ZELENKA
I said I was sorry. It was necessary for the tests.
SHEPPARD
You're the one who volunteered to go.
RONON
Well, if I do something like that again, shoot me.
ZELENKA
(low, to Sheppard)
He was like this all night, you know. Very agitated. Had me scared.
SHEPPARD
He'll be alright. Get him home, get him a nice warm bath, a hot
meal...
[Zelenka sits up and stares out the window.]
ZELENKA
Oh, no.
SHEPPARD
What?
ZELENKA
Where's Atlantis? It should be right in front of us.
[There is only open ocean in front of them.]
SHEPPARD
Well, why isn't it?
ZELENKA
Uh, I-I don't know.
SHEPPARD
Is it cloaked?
ZELENKA
No, no, no. They would have radioed us about it.
RONON
So what are you saying? We're lost?
ZELENKA
Wait-wait-wait-wait. Adjust your heading forty degrees south.
[Sheppard complies.]
ZELENKA
The navigation system is off.
SHEPPARD
Why?
ZELENKA
I-I don't know. It could be any of a number of reasons, you
know--clock drift, the fluctuations in the magnetosphere from the
sunspots...
SHEPPARD
(pointing at the city in the distance)
There it is.
[Zelenka says something in Czech]
SHEPPARD
See? No harm, no foul.
[He looks back at Ronon, who still sulks.]
SHEPPARD
You might wanna take Teyla up on her offer for meditation lessons.
Looks like you could use a little unwinding--
RONON
(sharply)
Just land this thing!
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--TEYLA'S PRACTICE ROOM
[Teyla sits cross-legged in the room. Ronon sits similarly behind her.
Both have their eyes closed.]
TEYLA
...And then slowly exhale, allowing each breath to cleanse you,
restoring your body and spirit. Feel your mind clearing, open to all
that surrounds you...Embrace the silence.
[Ronon snores loudly. Teyla's eyes snap open.]
TEYLA
Ronon?
[She turns around, looking at Ronon, who continues snoring. She appears
quite annoyed.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, NEAR CREW QUARTERS ATRIUM
[Teyla heads down steps and into the corridor, lost in her own
thoughts. She stops when she sees a woman in a long flowing gown
walking towards her.]
[The woman looks directly at Teyla with an intense expression.]
LANTIAN WOMAN
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
TEYLA
I'm sorry. I do not understand.
[The woman walks right through Teyla like a ghost. Teyla freezes in
shock, then looks everywhere. Nothing is around her.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM AND NEARBY CORRIDORS
[Weir heads out of the Gate Room. McKay catches up to her and they walk
quickly through the corridors side by side.]
MCKAY
Elizabeth. Did you get my e-mail?
WEIR
(sighing)
Which e-mail? One of the seven today, or one of the eighteen
yesterday?
MCKAY
I know, I'm being unusually persistent about this, but, uh, that
should only underscore its importance, yes?
WEIR
We cannot keep all three ZPMs from the Replicator takeover, Rodney.
We get one. Now, I don't know how to make it any clearer for you.
MCKAY
Well, I felt if I could just, um, outline the reasons for keeping
them. You know--bullet point, very brief.
WEIR
It was twenty-six pages!
MCKAY
I know, but if we hope to, uh, persuade Stargate Command ...
WEIR
Okay, so tell me. Who would you deprive of the other ZPMs? The
Antarctic outpost?
MCKAY
Well, no, because they need it to power the chair to protect Earth.
WEIR
Okay, how about the Odyssey, then? They're getting the other ZPM to
help in their fight against the Ori. Rodney, we have enough power
now to raise the shield, and cloak the city, and dial home. Please,
can you start seeing the glass as half-full?
MCKAY
(petulantly)
Well, you mean one-third full.
WEIR
(annoyed)
No more e-mails.
[Weir turns away. McKay makes a face, then turns and walks away into
the other direction.]
INT--TEYLA'S PRACTICE ROOM
[Ronon and Teyla spar with the sticks. Teyla presses her advantage and
hits Ronon hard with her body, twice. He struggles to stand up
straight.]
TEYLA
I am sorry. You weren't expecting that?
[Ronon grimaces as Teyla smiles broadly, having gotten her revenge.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR CREW QUARTERS ATRIUM
[Workout over, Teyla and Ronon walk down the steps. Both are
chuckling.]
RONON
I was tired. It a long day.
TEYLA
Hmm.
RONON
To be honest, I ...
TEYLA
(interrupting)
You don't care much for meditation.
RONON
Never could sit still long enough for it.
TEYLA
All the more reason for you to consider...
[She stops and stares down the corridor, frightened. The woman has
returned, exactly as before. Ronon looks at Teyla in concern. He sees
nothing in corridor.]
RONON
What is it?
LANTEAN WOMAN
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
TEYLA
That woman.
RONON
What...woman?
LANTEAN WOMAN
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Teyla moves quickly as if to get out of someone's way. Ronon still
sees nothing, and Teyla notes it. Teyla starts to follow the woman.
They reach the end of a passageway. The door opens to reveal a heavily
burned man stumbling out. Teyla jumps back with a cry, startled. Ronon
grabs her.]
RONON
Hey, hey--what's wrong?
[Teyla looks around but there is now nothing there: no burned man, no
open door.]
RONON
What?
EXT--BALCONY, DAY
[McKay looks out at the ocean with binoculars. He doesn't notice
Sheppard come onto the balcony behind him.]
MCKAY
Huh!
[McKay puts down his binoculars, eventually realizing Sheppard is
there.]
MCKAY
Hey. How long have you been standing there?
SHEPPARD
Hour or so.
MCKAY
What?! Why didn't you say anything? I feel like a...Oh. It's the
kidding.
SHEPPARD
What did you wanna show me?
[He hands his binoculars to Sheppard, who looks through them.]
MCKAY
Right there.
[He looks where McKay indicates and only sees ocean.]
SHEPPARD
Wow!
MCKAY
(pleased)
Hmm!
SHEPPARD
All that...water!
MCKAY
(rolling his eyes)
Just wait for it.
[Sheppard sees a whale breach the surface.]
MCKAY
It's my friend. He's back.
[Rodney and Sheppard smile at the site.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Beckett scans Teyla. Ronon and Weir are nearby.]
BECKETT
The scan's clean. No sign of any physical abnormality.
RONON
Yeah, we've seen devices that mess with people's minds -- caused
them to hallucinate things.
BECKETT
Aye, but they've always had corresponding neural activity to
indicate a problem. No, I'm afraid, for the moment anyway, there
doesn't appear to be any physiological reasons for her
hallucinations.
WEIR
Then why did she see what she saw?
BECKETT
I don't quite know.
TEYLA
Many Ancestors died here recently. During the Replicator invasion,
the crew of the Tria were all murdered. Perhaps they attempted to
ascend but were prevented from fully doing so--trapped between this
plane of existence and...the next.
WEIR
You mean ghosts?
RONON
You ask me, it's too much meditation.
[Teyla glares at Ronon.]
EXT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir and Sheppard walk down the corridor.]
SHEPPARD
Is she gonna be okay?
WEIR
I don't know. Hopefully she just needs some rest. We've all been
through quite a lot--
[McKay exits a corridor and spots the pair approaching.]
MCKAY
There you are.
WEIR
Rodney, I told you--
MCKAY
Oh, no, not you. I mean Sheppard.
WEIR
(insulted)
Thank you.
MCKAY
Oh, I mean, not that I don't wanna talk to you. Well, you can be a
part of this conversation. In fact, I think you'll probably find it
every bit as interesting as--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting)
What are you saying?
[McKay holds up the display on his tablet computer showing a marine
animal species.]
MCKAY
Check it out. Found it in the Ancient database. They have a whole
subsection on indigenous Lantean animal life. Did you know that
there was a lobster-like crustacean down there the size of a Buick?
WEIR
Hmm! And...what is that?
SHEPPARD
That's Rodney's whale friend.
MCKAY
Ah, but not actually a whale. Whale-like, but not a mammal. It's a
fish. It's a big, big fish.
SHEPPARD
Did the Ancients have a name for it?
MCKAY
Yeah. Flagecallus. I know, they were terrible at naming things.
I-I've just, um, I've just called it "whale" for now.
WEIR
And why are you studying this?
MCKAY
Oh, 'cause he's out there right now, circling the city. Sheppard and
I saw him. Probably the very same whale that saved me last year when
I was trapped in that submerged jumper.
SHEPPARD
I thought Zelenka and I saved you?
MCKAY
Well, you did...technically, but only after Sam led you to me.
WEIR
Sam?
MCKAY
Uh, it's the whale. I named him -- after Sam...antha Carter. It's
personal reasons.
SHEPPARD
You named him after Samantha Carter?
MCKAY
(defensively)
Well, Sam's a boy's name too.
[Sheppard bites back further retort.]
WEIR
And how do you know he's a "he"?
MCKAY
Oh, because I cross-referenced the renderings in the database with
the whale outside and, you'll see the males have a rather
prominent...
[He starts bringing up another display on his tablet.]
WEIR
(interrupting and looking away)
Oh, it's okay, never mind. I'll take your word for it. I trust this
little diversion isn't actually cutting into your work time?
MCKAY
Oh, no, no. No, of course not. No-no, I-I'm just, um, dabbling in my
free time.
WEIR
All right, then, boys, dabble away!
[Sheppard smiles at the whole exchange. Weir slaps Rodney on the arm
and walks away. After a moment, Sheppard and McKay continue walking.]
SHEPPARD
So, these, uh, whales. Did the Ancients say they're good eating?
MCKAY
Oh, you wouldn't!
SHEPPARD
I would.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--TEYLA'S QUARTERS
[Teyla gets into bed. She hears the strange voices again. She gets up.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Teyla walks out into the corridor, once again spotting the woman in
the white dress, who clearly looks afraid. She follows.]
TEYLA
Hello?
[The woman continues walking swiftly through the corridor. Teyla
hurries to catch up.]
TEYLA
Wait!
[Teyla slows down as she realizes the woman is once again reaching a
doorway. Again, it opens and the burned man stumbles out. The woman
grabs to catch him from falling, then turns to Teyla, as if pleading
for help.]
LANTEAN WOMAN
Screams Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Teyla claps her hands over her ears from the high pitched screams.]
INT--HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE
[Teyla meets with Heightmeyer.]
HEIGHTMEYER
You don't understand what the woman is saying?
TEYLA
No. I believe she is speaking in the Ancestral tongue.
HEIGHTMEYER
Mmm. You said she's afraid? Of the burned man?
TEYLA
No. It is my sense that she's trying to...help him. Whatever it is
she fears, I do not know.
HEIGHTMEYER
Did you try to talk to her?
TEYLA
Yes, but she seems unaware of me. It is as if I'm...not even there.
HEIGHTMEYER
If these are apparitions, why do you think they're appearing to you?
[Teyla shakes her head in ignorance, then chuckles.]
TEYLA
Too much meditation.
[Heightmeyer looks confused.]
TEYLA
(shaking her head)
Something Ronon said to me.
HEIGHTMEYER
Oh. Well, there are those who believe that meditation is a way of
opening a door to the spiritual world.
TEYLA
If these are Ancestors trapped between planes of existence, perhaps
they are trying to communicate something to me. Maybe they believe I
can help them to move on.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Heightmeyer walks with Weir.]
HEIGHTMEYER
I don't know why she's experiencing these visions, but she's always
been one to shoulder a lot of emotional responsibility. She may be
carrying some guilt over what happened to the Ancients here
recently.
WEIR
Well, why? It certainly wasn't her fault.
HEIGHTMEYER
No, no, of course not, but somewhere deep inside her she may somehow
feel complicit in the actions that led up to their murders.
WEIR
Hmm.
HEIGHTMEYER
I'll continue working with her and see if I can sort things out.
WEIR
Okay. I'll make sure she gets some rest, even if it means taking her
off the next mission.
HEIGHTMEYER
Ugh, she does seem tired. She hasn't been sleeping well, and the
last few days she's been complaining of headaches.
WEIR
Huh, Doctor Beckett gave her a clean bill of health.
HEIGHTMEYER
Well, we'll just keep an eye on her. Hopefully it'll all pass.
WEIR
Let's hope so. Thank you.
[Heightmeyer walks away. Weir goes to a doorway and passes her hand
over the control to open it. The door opens and the burned man stands
before her. Weir jumps, startled, looking around to see if anyone else
also notices it. When she turns back, the burned man has disappeared.]
LATER
[Along a different corridor, Heightmeyer, Teyla, and Weir walk
together.]
HEIGHTMEYER
So now both of you are seeing them? Why do you suppose that is?
WEIR
Well, that's why we've come to you.
TEYLA
Perhaps they believe that appearing to two people will increase the
chance their message will be heard.
WEIR
If in fact, they are trying to communicate something to us...
HEIGHTMEYER
Or maybe it's just the power of suggestion. It's been documented
that when one person sees a ghost, it won't be long before others
around them see it too. You said it yourself. You've all been
through a lot recently. When's the last time you took a day off?
[Weir and Teyla both sigh and exchange looks.]
HEIGHTMEYER
Exactly. Have you seen any more apparitions?
TEYLA
Not recently.
HEIGHTMEYER
How are the headaches?
TEYLA
Still have them.
HEIGHTMEYER
Have you been able to sleep?
[Teyla shakes her head negatively.]
HEIGHTMEYER
Perhaps Doctor Beckett can prescribe something for you.
(glancing at Weir)
For both of you.
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Sheppard joins McKay in his lab.]
MCKAY
Ah. There you are. You are not gonna believe this. I've been
monitoring Sam on the underwater scanner.
SHEPPARD
Stop calling him that.
MCKAY
Why?
SHEPPARD
It's creepy!
MCKAY
No it's not. Look, here he is, circling the city. He's been doing it
for a while. Won't leave.
SHEPPARD
You didn't feed him, did you?
MCKAY
No! Look, now if I widen the scan...
[He does so. A sonar image shows two creatures outside the original
range.]
SHEPPARD
Another whale.
MCKAY
Yeah. Probably the mother.
SHEPPARD
That guy's the size of a football field!
MCKAY
A Canadian football field.
SHEPPARD
So the first one was a baby.
MCKAY
Yeah.
SHEPPARD
Hey, wanna take a closer look?
MCKAY
Uh...
[Sheppard rushes out, and McKay follows.]
INT--JUMPER BAY
[Sheppard enters a jumper to find Zelenka already inside, running a
diagnostic.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, Radek. Didn't know anyone was here.
ZELENKA
Do you need to use the jumper?
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Gonna check out some whales. Rodney's on his way. He's just
taking some Dramamine but, uh...yeah, we can take another jumper.
ZELENKA
Oh-oh, just be careful. I'm not too sure if I've fixed the
navigational glitch. Uh, the other jumpers might be affected as
well.
SHEPPARD
Well, we won't go far. We'll stay within sight of the city. Plus
you'll be tracking us from the Control Room.
[Sheppard leaves to find another jumper.]
ZELENKA
(calling after him)
I will? Oh, yes, yes, I will. Did you say whales?
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett takes some medicine out of the cabinet and turns to a waiting
Weir and Teyla.]
BECKETT
These should help, but don't take them until you can have at least
eight hours of uninterrupted rest.
WEIR
Huh! Around here?! When does that ever happen?
BECKETT
Well, both Doctor Heightmeyer and I think you should take the time
to make it happen.
WEIR
All right. Thank you, Carson.
TEYLA
Thank you.
[Teyla and Weir leave. Beckett sits at his desk, then hears a strange
sound. He turns and spots several people working on a patient under
bright lights.]
[Beckett gets up and approaches. The patient sits up. It is the heavily
burned man, crying out something alien and clearly in agony. Beckett
blinks, and the medical personnel and patient are gone. There are just
several made up gurneys, showing no one has been near.]
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY
[A puddle jumper flies low, then hovers to slowly sink into the ocean.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay looks around the jumper worriedly. Sheppard notices.]
SHEPPARD
You all right?
MCKAY
Yeah, I'm fine. I just never feel safe in these things underwater.
SHEPPARD
(skeptically)
In space you're okay?
MCKAY
Yeah, of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Zelenka, you there?
ZELENKA
(over radio)
I'm here. Hello!
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
Uh, the whales are deeper now, less than a kilometer from you in
your...two o'clock position.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay activates the HUD.]
MCKAY
Well, there they are. We should have a visual on them any moment
now.
[He deactivates the HUD. Eventually they spot a whale in the distance.]
MCKAY
There's Sam.
[Another, much larger whale appears out of the murky depths near
"Sam."]
MCKAY
... and there's Mama.
SHEPPARD
We need to get a closer look.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Ronon walks around a corner.]
LANTEAN FEMALE SCIENTIST
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Ronon turns around. Where nothing but a plant was before, now there is
a computer station with strange symbols on the monitor. In front of the
computer are two scientists, dressed in white pant outfits and speaking
in the same strange tongue Teyla heard. They are speaking to each with
great urgency.]
LANTEAN MALE SCIENTIST
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
LANTEAN FEMALE SCIENTIST
(frantically)
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Teyla approaches from behind.]
TEYLA
(cautiously)
Ronon? You saw them too?
[A disturbed Ronon turns to look at Teyla, then turns back. The
scientists and the computer are now gone.]
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, UNDERWATER
[The puddle jumper continues to travel deeper underwater.]
INT--PUDDLEJUMPER
MCKAY
All right, not too close now, okay? We still have no idea what these
things eat.
[McKay turns and notices Sheppard wincing in pain, running his hand
over his eyes.]
MCKAY
What? What is it?
SHEPPARD
Nothing. I just got a headache all of a sudden.
MCKAY
Oh.
[They look back at the window. Nothing but water can be seen.]
MCKAY
Where'd they go?
SHEPPARD
I don't know.
[Suddenly, the water can be heard shifting and a large shape comes
right in front of them. One of the whales has drawn much closer. Part
of his head and eye completely fill the view-screen.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
Oh! They're right in front of you.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Yeah! Well we're aware of that!
[Sheppard looks over to see McKay clutching his head.]
SHEPPARD
What's wrong?
MCKAY
(breathing erratically)
It's, uh...now my head's hurting too.
SHEPPARD
All right. That's not a coincidence.
MCKAY
I don't think so.
SHEPPARD
I'm pulling back.
MCKAY
(shakily)
Good idea.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
Perhaps it's the whales' echo location mechanism. It's creating
uncomfortable vibrations which are...are coming--
INT--PUDDLEJUMPER
[Sheppard is piloting the Jumper away.]
MCKAY
(interrupting, annoyed)
Yes, Radek. We are moving away. Try to keep up, okay?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
Oh my.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Oh my, what?
ZELENKA
Uh, uh, uh, I'm detecting several more whales.
MCKAY
How many more?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka's screen shows a pod of whale-shaped objects approaching
Atlantis, the puddlejumper, and the two whales.]
ZELENKA
Uh, dozens more. They're still several kilometers away from you, but
they're heading towards you.
INT--PUDDLEJUMPER
[Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks. Sheppard does a
double-take.]
SHEPPARD
(concerned)
Rodney?
MCKAY
(weakly)
What?
[McKay's nose is bleeding.]
SHEPPARD
Your nose is bleeding.
[McKay wipes at his nose and sees his hand covered in blood.]
MCKAY
Oh!
[He tilts his head back and pinches his nose to stop the bleeding.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Teyla, Ronon, Beckett, Weir, and Heightmeyer are standing in the midst
of a discussion.]
HEIGHTMEYER
(puzzled)
Now you're all seeing them?
WEIR
We just got word that other people in the city are starting to see
them, too.
BECKETT
Some see the burned man, others see the Ancient woman, and a few
such as Ronon here see what appear to be scientists.
RONON
There's something definitely going on around here.
WEIR
In every sighting, two things remain constant. All of the
apparitions are Ancients, and they all seem pretty worried.
TEYLA
It is as if they are trying to warn us about something.
ZELENKA
(over radio)
Doctor Weir?
WEIR
(keying headset)
Yes, Radek?
ZELENKA
You'd better come to the Control Room. Right away.
WEIR
Be right there.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
What's their status?
ZELENKA
They're moving away from the whales. Hopefully that will alleviate
their pain.
WEIR
(keying radio)
John, this is Elizabeth. How are you holding up?
INT--PUDDLEJUMPER
[McKay's nose has stopped bleeding, but he still looks very ill.]
SHEPPARD
Other than feeling like my head's about to explode, I'm fine.
[One of the whales swims directly in front of them.]
MCKAY
I thought we were moving away from them?
SHEPPARD
I'm trying to, but they're cutting us off.
MCKAY
(in pain and frustration)
Ohhh!
WEIR
(over radio)
What happened?
SHEPPARD
The whales are getting way too close.
[McKay moans and pitches forward, unconscious.]
SHEPPARD
Crap!
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
John, what's going on there?
INT--PUDDLEJUMPER
SHEPPARD
Rodney's passed out. His ears are bleeding. We've gotta get out of
the water.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Medical team to Jumper Bay.
(into radio)
John, are you all right?
INT--PUDDLEJUMPER
[Sheppard winces, putting his hand to the side of his face. He notices
as he pulls his hand away that his ear is bleeding too.]
WEIR
(over radio, more urgently)
John?
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY
[The puddle jumper bursts out of the water at high speed, flying
straight up.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We're out of the water. Rodney's in trouble. Have a medical team
ready.
WEIR
(into radio)
Already done.
[Weir looks over at Zelenka's screen. The whales continue to approach
Atlantis, and there are even more of them, perhaps dozens.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--INFIRMARY
[McKay and Sheppard are both in hospital scrubs, lying on adjacent
beds. Nearby, Zelenka and Weir talk to Beckett.]
BECKETT
Their eardrums have been perforated.
WEIR
How?
ZELENKA
The whales are emitting an intense low-frequency pulse, like-like a
sonar, as well as an EM field. The combination is very dangerous to
humans, particularly in such close proximity.
MCKAY
(shouting)
It's the whales!
BECKETT
(to Weir)
Hearing's been impaired. It should heal soon.
MCKAY
(shouting)
It's their echo location. It's creating very powerful vibrations.
The closer we got, the worse it became.
ZELENKA
(shouting, to Rodney)
Yes-yes, Rodney, we know!
MCKAY
Oh!
[Everyone reacts to Rodney's shouting except Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
(shouting)
What?
BECKETT
(to Weir)
They should rest.
WEIR
Agreed.
(loudly to Sheppard and McKay)
I'll come back.
[She leaves. Sheppard and McKay look puzzled but remain where they
are.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The screen shows more pods headed toward the city.]
ZELENKA
The whales are approaching from every direction. It appears that
they're...converging on Atlantis.
WEIR
We're their destination.
ZELENKA
Yes. It appears so. The signals they emit are their way of
communicating with each other. Unfortunately, the closer they get to
the city, the more it may affect the people living here.
RONON
Even above the waterline?
TEYLA
We are already being affected. Several of us are experiencing
headaches--not as severe as Doctor McKay or Colonel Sheppard, but if
these whales get any closer ...
WEIR
Turn on the shield.
ZELENKA
Aye.
TEYLA
These apparitions we've been seeing--if they are indeed trying to
warn us of something, perhaps this is it. I first saw the Ancient
woman at the same time Rodney saw the first whale.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir walks down a crowded corridor, making notes on a tablet computer.
The Lantean woman who appears to Teyla starts walking towards Weir.]
LANTEAN WOMAN
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Only Weir has noticed the woman, who continues walking past Weir,
oblivious to all.]
LANTEAN WOMAN
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Weir turns, watching the woman go by, then turns back around as she
notices two guards looking at her strangely.]
INT--INFIRMARY
SHEPPARD
(only slightly louder than normal)
Pain's goin' away. I think my hearing's getting better too. What
about you?
[McKay does not appear to hear Sheppard. He continues busily working on
his tablet computer.]
SHEPPARD
(louder again)
Rodney?
[McKay remains oblivious.]
SHEPPARD
Canadian Football League's a joke.
[McKay continues to press buttons on his computer.]
SHEPPARD
Celine Dion is overrated.
(just short of shouting)
Zelenka is smarter than you are!
MCKAY
(still oblivious, shouting)
Hey! I found mention of a bio-lab in the database! Ancient
scientists used it to study animal life. We should check it out!
SHEPPARD
(frustrated)
Okay...Meredith.
[In another area of the infirmary, Beckett and other medical staff are
treating several patients. Weir enters.]
WEIR
How's it going?
BECKETT
More people are falling ill: headaches, nosebleeds. I'm giving
everyone painkillers. Hopefully buy us some time until we figure out
how to stop this.
WEIR
And how are you feeling?
BECKETT
Eh, my head's throbbing a wee bit, but I'll manage. You?
WEIR
I'm fine.
BECKETT
All right. Here. Painkillers, just in case.
[He hands her some packets of pills.]
WEIR
Thank you. I hope it doesn't get ...
(spots fully dressed McKay and Sheppard exiting)
Hey, hey! What's this?
BECKETT
Well, that's a damned good question. Who said you could get out of
bed?
SHEPPARD
(loudly)
We're feeling a lot better.
BECKETT
(loudly)
Well, I beg to differ. Back to bed, the pair of you.
MCKAY
(shouting)
Yeah, we need to check out a lab.
WEIR
(shouting)
What lab?
MCKAY
(loudly)
It's a bio-lab. It turned up in my whale research.
SHEPPARD
(loudly)
It's in, uh, one of the flooded areas of the city.
MCKAY
(continuing)
Formerly flooded. With the area finally repaired, we're now able to
access it. According to the database, the Ancient biologists used it
to study animal life on the planet. Look, there may be some more
information stored there.
SHEPPARD
(loudly)
Such as, uh, how to tell these whales how to get the hell outta
here.
MCKAY
(loudly)
But we won't know that for sure until I can have a look at it.
[Weir and Beckett exchange looks.]
BECKETT
All right.
[He gestures they can leave.]
MCKAY
Ah.
[They depart.]
TECHNICIAN
(over radio)
Doctor Weir?
WEIR
(keying comm)
Go ahead.
TECHNICIAN
Daedalus just arrived in orbit. They're requesting permission to
beam people down.
[Weir sighs and looks at Beckett.]
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus sits in orbit above Atlantis.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
What do you mean, no?
WEIR
(over radio)
I'm afraid things down here might get a lot worse before they get
any better. It's probably safer for you to stay up there until we
can sort this problem out.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Teyla walks down a stairwell, nervously looking about. After turning a
corner, she spots the Lantean woman approaching.]
LANTEAN WOMAN
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
TEYLA
I'm sorry. I do not understand.
[She cringes as the woman passes, a strange high pitched sound heard.
Clutching her ears, Teyla turns around again to find the two scientists
and computer terminal Ronon previously saw. A high pitched whine
underlies their words.]
MALE LANTEAN SCIENTIST
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
[Teyla tries to open a door to escape. It opens to reveal the burned
man who cries out in an echoing low pitched whine. Teyla falls
backward, nose bleeding. She opens her eyes to find Ronon bending over
her, reaching out his hand.]
RONON
Come on. Gotta get you to the infirmary.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and McKay walk down a mostly dark corridor. McKay studying
his tablet. He comes to an abrupt halt and hold up his fist in a
military gesture for "halt". Sheppard raises his eyebrows in surprise,
then scowls and knocks down McKay's hand. Oblivious, McKay points to a
door to their left.]
MCKAY
(loudly)
This is it!
[Sheppard, still scowling, walks around McKay and enters, McKay
following.]
INT--LAB
MCKAY
(in normal voice)
All right. Let's see.
[McKay starts activating the display. A variety of unintelligible sound
frequencies are being monitored.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Did you put up the shield?
WEIR
(over comms)
Yes, but it only extends so far, and the whales' signals seem to be
able to penetrate it.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
Well, we might be able to manage it if there were only a few dozen
whales, but we're talking hundreds now. And they're swimming closer
as we speak.
[His display shows the same.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
WEIR
(over comms)
Doctor McKay is checking out an Ancient bio-lab. Hopefully, there'll
be some information there that could lead us to a solution.
CALDWELL
And if there isn't?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Well, we'll have to consider evacuating Atlantis until the whales
leave.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Supposing they don't leave?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
What are you suggesting, Colonel?
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
You've got plenty of drones in your arsenal.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
You're saying we should kill them?
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Before they kill you.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay and Sheppard enter.]
MCKAY
They're not trying to kill us. It's quite the opposite. I think
they're trying to help us.
WEIR
Help us?
MCKAY
Come on. You should see this.
[McKay grabs a laptop and some other equipment and starts to leave
again.]
ZELENKA
Mmm. I see your hearing has improved.
MCKAY
What?
[Zelenka shakes his head and gestures McKay to lead them out.]
MCKAY
(to Weir)
What is he...?
INT--ANCIENT LAB
MCKAY
It's like a receiver calibrated to the specific frequencies on which
the whales communicate.
SHEPPARD
The Ancients designed it to study whales, so they could learn about
their songs.
MCKAY
They were studying the whales' language, trying to assign
frequencies to emotions and identify moods.
SHEPPARD
All sorts of tree-huggy stuff. Tell 'em about the ghosts.
MCKAY
Ah. Not ghosts--image projections. There appears to be a causal
relationship with the whales. They may very well be what's been
projecting the images to us, and this receiver should , from what I
can tell so far, be able to interpret them.
SHEPPARD
Seems like we've been going about this backwards. The ghosts aren't
warning us about the whales.
ZELENKA
They're not?
MCKAY
No. No, it seems the whales may be using the images to warn us.
WEIR
About what?
MCKAY
Ah, well, that, uh...that I don't know yet.
SHEPPARD
But, judging from the way this machine is freaking out, it can't be
good.
INT--INFIRMARY
[Patients are now confined to the floor and chairs, the infirmary is so
overcrowded. Beckett checks on a few.]
BECKETT
(to one of his staff)
All right?
[He continues to Teyla's bed.]
BECKETT
How are you faring?
[Teyla looks over and watches a Lantean medical team working on the
burned man.]
TEYLA
I keep seeing them.
BECKETT
Aye.
[Beckett looks in the opposite direction and sees a similar vision.]
BECKETT
Me too.
[Weir enters. She looks ill.]
WEIR
I just spoke with Colonel Caldwell. The Daedalus infirmary is ready
to beam up the sickest of the patients.
BECKETT
Good. Teyla should be amongst the first to go.
TEYLA
No. I'm staying.
BECKETT
You're far too sick, dear.
[She stares at the vision, noting a patch with Ancient writing on the
man's sleeve.]
TEYLA
(to herself)
He is a pilot.
(to Weir and Beckett)
The burned man. I just noticed his uniform. He is an Ancient pilot.
[Carson looks ready to fall over.]
WEIR
Carson!
BECKETT
Aye?
WEIR
Your nose.
[Beckett touches his nose, it comes away with some blood.]
BECKETT
Oh, bloody hell. Excuse me.
[He leaves.]
INT--ANCIENT LAB
[Weir enters. Sheppard watches McKay work.]
WEIR
How's he doing?
SHEPPARD
I don't know. He's taking a while. A lot longer than he usually
takes.
MCKAY
He can hear you, you know!
SHEPPARD
Yeah. We know.
MCKAY
Okay, let's have a listen.
[He presses some keys.]
LANTIAN WOMAN
(over recording)
Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.
SHEPPARD
Who's that?
WEIR
The woman. The Ancient woman. That's her voice, I'm sure of it.
SHEPPARD
She's speaking Ancient?
WEIR
No. I-I mean, it doesn't sound like the language. The phonetic
rhythm is similar, but I don't recognize any of the words.
MCKAY
That's because it's gibberish. Well, to be more accurate, it's an
attempt at mimicry. Look, it turns out the receiver is also a
transmitter. The Ancients weren't just trying to learn the whales'
language; they were attempting to teach them theirs by sending them
auditory and visual signals. And while they were doing that, they
experienced a traumatic moment which the whales then stored in their
genetic memory.
WEIR
And that's what the images we've been seeing are?
MCKAY
Exactly. Reruns. Now, unfortunately, these whales are several
generations removed from the incident, so they're, um, finding the
language a bit of a tough go. It's kind of like trying to sing the
lyrics to the macarena. You can sound out the words, but you have no
idea what you're singing.
WEIR
Okay, so this traumatic event, I'm assuming it's the war against the
Wraith.
MCKAY
That would be my assumption as well, yes.
WEIR
And, what? The whales are trying to warn us that it might happen
again?
MCKAY
I don't know. Possibly.
SHEPPARD
So what? The Wraith might attack. Tell us something we don't know.
MCKAY
Ah. Interesting thing is, the Ancients seemed to be aware of the
whales' deficient mimicry skills, and so they incorporated a kind
of, um...acoustic language filter into the receiver. That's what's
been taking me so long to figure out.
SHEPPARD
Well, did you figure it out?
MCKAY
Well, let's have a listen, shall we?
[Similar gibberish comes through the speaker.]
SHEPPARD
Guess the answer's no.
MCKAY
Well, just hang on, hang on. If I, um...
[McKay touches some more keys.]
LANTIAN WOMAN
Speaks more clear Ancient.
WEIR
Hey, wait a minute. Play that back again.
LANTIAN WOMAN
Speaks more clear Ancient.
WEIR
(smiling)
This is Ancient. At least, I can make out a few of the words now.
MCKAY
Ha!
WEIR
"Incursus". Something was attacked, or overtaken.
MCKAY
Meaning Atlantis.
WEIR
No, I don't think so. "Adaris"?
SHEPPARD
What's "Adaris"?
WEIR
I don't know.
INT--CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka reports to Weir. They are both in the control room.]
ZELENKA
They've arrived -- hundreds of them.
[The following conversation switches back and forth between the control
room and Daedalus bridge.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Doctor Weir.
WEIR
Go ahead, Colonel.
CALDWELL
The sick patients have been beamed up. Our infirmary's filled.
WEIR
Thank you. Unfortunately, more people are falling ill down here, so
it's not really making much of a dent.
CALDWELL
Listen, whether these creatures are trying to communicate with you
or not, at some point you're gonna have to deal with them. If they
don't leave...
WEIR
I'm sure there are options besides killing them.
[McKay and Sheppard rush in.]
WEIR
(to Sheppard and McKay)
What's wrong?
SHEPPARD
We figured it out.
MCKAY
Well, actually, I did most of the figuring, but, uh ...
SHEPPARD
Adaris is a ship we found in the Ancient database.
MCKAY
It's an Ancient science vessel. About, uh, fifteen thousand years
ago, it ran into some trouble. The entire crew was killed except for
the pilot.
WEIR
The burned man. Teyla noticed the uniform. He was an Ancient pilot.
MCKAY
Which would explain the burns.
ZELENKA
What does?
SHEPPARD
The ship got hit by a blast of radiation from the sun.
MCKAY
It's a coronal mass ejection on a scale that dwarfs anything our sun
has ever emitted. Apparently the sun in this solar system goes
through an unusually turbulent sunspot cycle every fifteen thousand
years or so. The Ancients have records of this class of CME
occurring twice before.
SHEPPARD
The ship was very close to the sun when it happened.
MCKAY
It's a massive prominence. It arced up and then collapsed when the
magnetic field surrounding it weakened. We're talking an intense
proton stream traveling at over four thousand kilometers per second.
SHEPPARD
Most of the crew was killed instantly but the pilot managed to open
up a hyperspace window just as they were hit. He flew the ship back
here, jumping ahead of the radiation wave just in time to warn
everyone.
MCKAY
And the Ancients were able to raise the shield and extend it far
enough to protect a large portion of the planet from the blast.
WEIR
So what are you telling me? This is going to happen soon?
MCKAY
Not soon. It's happening right now.
[McKay shows his laptop screen indicating the sun has already had a
giant flare.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Ronon comes to Teyla's bedside, pulling up a stool.]
RONON
How're you doing?
TEYLA
(weakly)
I have felt better.
RONON
You need any more pain medicine?
TEYLA
No. It does not seem to help any more.
RONON
Well, just hang on. You're gonna be fine.
[Teyla keeps her eyes closed.]
RONON
Teyla? Look at me.Look at me. You gotta hold on. Gotta teach me
those, uh, meditation lessons.
[Teyla chuckles slightly.]
TEYLA
You are hopeless.
RONON
(grinning)
Yeah. I know.
[Teyla passes out.]
RONON
Teyla? Nurse.
[A nurse approaches.]
INT--CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
The magnetic field around it is already beginning to weaken. When
that prominence collapses, the coronal mass ejection will occur.
It'll erupt from a very small area -- a mere pinprick in comparison
to the total sun's surface. But it'll immediately begin to fan out.
Within a few million miles, the blast wave will cut a swath wide
enough to take out this entire planet.
SHEPPARD
How much time do we have?
ZELENKA
The prominence will collapse any moment now. After that, we have
less than an hour before the radiation wave hits us.
WEIR
Why didn't we notice this before?
MCKAY
Well, because these things happen very quickly.
ZELENKA
This kind of sunspot cycle is extremely chaotic, im-impossible to
predict. No doubt that's what caused the glitch in the jumper's
navigational systems.
MCKAY
Not to mention our focus was on attack from the Wraith, not the sun.
WEIR
Yet the whales were aware this was happening.
MCKAY
Well, a lot of animals: whales, dolphins ...
ZELENKA
Pigeons.
MCKAY
...are affected by the tiniest anomalies in the magnetosphere. It's
as if their, uh, internal compasses are somehow, eh...Pigeons?!
ZELENKA
Yeah, homing pigeons. Er, I used to raise them before coming here.
We used to consult solar charts before our pigeon races.
MCKAY
Pigeon races?
WEIR
Rodney.
MCKAY
Well, it's still somewhat of a mystery how they're able to sense
this trouble, but they do, often well before we do.
SHEPPARD
Whatever. What are our options?
MCKAY
Well, the Ancients were able to raise the shield and stretch it wide
enough to protect a significant portion of the planet--attenuated,
to be sure, more of a thin bubble--but it was able to, uh, block out
enough of the radiation.
ZELENKA
That's interesting, because we have found evidence of mass
extinction on other parts of the planet.
MCKAY
Wow! Well, now we know what caused it.
WEIR
Okay, so our shield is already activated. What else?
MCKAY
Ah. Small problem. The Ancients had three ZPMs at their disposal.
We, as you know, only have one. Well, maybe I was so insistent on
keeping them, because I too am able to sense trouble on the horizon.
SHEPPARD
Just like a pigeon.
WEIR
So, we just need to get the other two ZPMs back here...temporarily.
MCKAY
(interrupting)
Not enough time. Look, the Odyssey's away from Earth. In the time it
would take them to return, the blast wave would almost certainly
have hit us.
SHEPPARD
So how far can we extend the shield with one ZPM?
ZELENKA
Well, enough to cover the city and perhaps a little bit of the ocean
surrounding it, but...
SHEPPARD
We should evacuate, just to make sure.
MCKAY
Yeah, we can't gate to Earth. Look, we need the ZPM's power for the
shields.
SHEPPARD
What about the Intergalactic Bridge?
MCKAY
The midway station isn't completed yet. We'd need to ferry people by
jumper. Again, no time.
SHEPPARD
All right, well, we'll send everyone to the Alpha Site and pick 'em
up when this is over.
MCKAY
I don't think you understand. Look, the shield will protect the city
from the initial blast, yes, but the entire ecosystem of this planet
will be damaged beyond recovery for hundreds of years. Look, we're
talking no plant life, which means no breathable air. We're...
[Weir faints, her ear bleeding.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[Sheppard carries Weir into the infirmary and places her on a gurney.]
SHEPPARD
Beckett.
[He hurries over.]
BECKETT
Elizabeth?
[He pulls out her headset, noticing her ear is bleeding.]
BECKETT
Dammit.
[Sheppard sees them putting a blanket over one of the people. Beckett
sees where he's looking.]
BECKETT
Sergeant Bale. Developed an aneurysm from the pressure. First
fatality.
[Sheppard walks over to Ronon and the unconscious Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
How is she?
RONON
Out of time.
SHEPPARD
Guess we all are.
[He starts to leave.]
RONON
Sheppard? You got a plan?
SHEPPARD
(unconvincingly)
Sure.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
ZELENKA
Look at them. Seeking shelter underneath the umbrella of the city.
MCKAY
No-no-no-no-no-no-no. We don't have nearly enough power. Look, we
can extend the shield twenty kilometers beyond the city, maybe. But
it'll be dangerously thin and there's no way of knowing whether we
can sustain it, especially in a radiation blast of fifty thousand
REM.
[Sheppard thinks quickly, getting an idea.]
SHEPPARD
(keying radio)
Colonel Caldwell, this is Sheppard.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Go ahead, Colonel.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
I think we have a plan.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
We do?
INT--ZPM ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay are there. The ZPM is removed from its chamber.]
MCKAY
(sighing)
This is not a good plan.
SHEPPARD
Sure it is.
MCKAY
You realize just how close we'll have to get to the sun?
SHEPPARD
Pretty damned close, I'm thinking.
[Sheppard pulls out a case with which to transport the ZPM.]
MCKAY
No, suicidally close. I mean, we'll be toast.
SHEPPARD
That's why we're taking the ZPM, to give the Daedalus's shield an
extra boost.
MCKAY
Okay, okay. You want to deflect the coronal mass ejection away from
the planet.
SHEPPARD
Ah. Like an umbrella.
[McKay starts drawing circles and lines on his tablet computer.]
MCKAY
Okay, listen to me. This. This is the sun; and this. This is us. A
bolt of energy unlike anything you could possibly comprehend is
gonna shoot out of the photosphere at a tremendous velocity, Okay?
It is immediately gonna start fanning out, like so.
SHEPPARD
(impatiently)
I know.
MCKAY
Which means that we will have to be really close to the surface of
the sun if we wanna intercept that stream and deflect it before it
can start spreading out.
[Sheppard glances up from where he is working.]
SHEPPARD
I know, Rodney!
MCKAY
No, no, I don't think you do. I don't think you fully grasp the
reality of just how damned hot it gets that close to the surface of
the sun.
SHEPPARD
That's why we're taking a ZPM--to strengthen the shields.
MCKAY
From the blast wave, yes. But even with the shields at that
strength, the-the build-up of residual heat behind it could cause
serious problems for the Daedalus, and everyone inside it.
SHEPPARD
"Could." Could cause.
MCKAY
Okay. Tell me, if this is such a great plan, why didn't the Ancients
do it?
SHEPPARD
They were in the middle of a war! They probably didn't have a ship
available at the time. And, like you said, they had three ZPMs.
ZELENKA
(over radio)
Rodney?
MCKAY
(annoyed)
What?
ZELENKA
The prominence has begun collapsing.
SHEPPARD
Colonel Caldwell, we're ready.
[They're beamed away.]
EXT--SPACE
[The Daedalus breaks orbit from Atlantis.]
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD GENERATOR ROOM
[McKay carefully works with the ZPM. The device is connected by wires
to some other equipment, and Rodney moves around to make other
connections.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
How's it going, Rodney?
MCKAY
You know, this might look easy, but it's actually a little more
complicated than just flipping a switch.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Hurry up, please. We're there.
INT--SHIELD ROOM
[McKay opens a crystal chamber, but stops his work, distracted.]
MCKAY
What? We are already?
CALDWELL
(dryly, over radio)
Didn't have far to go.
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus approaches the sun.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Position, Doctor. The shields are up. We need the extra power from
that ZPM now.
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
Yes, yes! I just need to ...
[He glances at the monitor.]
MCKAY
Oh no.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
What?
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
The prominence is fully collapsing into the photosphere. Brace
yourselves.
[McKay starts frantically typing on his tablet computer.]
EXT--SPACE
[The sun has a small implosion, and the emission bursts out of the
result, heading straight into space.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell and the crew wince at the brightness heading directly for
them.]
SHEPPARD
Rodney?
INT--SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
ZPM is online.
[McKay stops typing and nervously watches the ZPM.]
EXT--SPACE
[The emission strikes the Daedalus shields, scattering to either side
of the ship.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
How long will this last, Doctor?
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
Anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
Hours?! You never said anything about hours!
CALDWELL
We're building up serious heat behind the shield.
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
I told you this wasn't a good plan!
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
RONON
How are they doing?
ZELENKA
Well, according to my calculations, the blast wave should have hit
us by now, but I'm reading no discernible increase in radiation.
RONON
(blankly)
So they're doing good?
ZELENKA
(smiling and nodding)
Yes. So far, anyway.
EXT--SPACE
[The emission continues to batter against Daedalus's shield.]
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
Temperature inside the shield's rising too fast. And I'm already
detecting several failed sensors on the bow.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
If this thing keeps going, the heat build-up could damage the hull.
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
Not "could". It's already damaging it. We have a breach in the 302
Bay.
[An alarm sounds.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
(to crew member)
Seal it off.
EXT--SPACE
[The ship shakes as the emission continues. Pieces of the ship break
off against the strain.]
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
Another breach! Deck Four! We're venting atmosphere!
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The bridge crew and Sheppard continue to watch.]
EXT--SPACE
[The emission abruptly ends.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell and Sheppard look at each other.]
SHEPPARD
Rodney?
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
It's over.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
And we're not toast.
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
MCKAY
(elated)
We're not toast!
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
Good plan, huh?
INT--DAEDALUS SHIELD ROOM
[McKay sighs in relief.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka, Sheppard and Weir look at a display. It shows only a few
whales near the city, and they are swimming away.]
ZELENKA
Most of them are gone now. They began dispersing almost immediately.
SHEPPARD
Without so much as a thank you.
WEIR
(loudly)
No. Thank you!
[She walks away as Zelenka and Sheppard exchange looks.]
INT--TEYLA'S PRACTICE ROOM
[Teyla meditates. Ronon enters, crouching beside her. After a moment,
she looks over and smiles.]
RONON
How are you feeling?
TEYLA
Much better.
RONON
Walked the whole way over here, didn't see one ghost.
TEYLA
(sighing in relief)
Nor did I.
RONON
Mind if I join you--
TEYLA
(threateningly)
If you fall asleep one more time ...
[He walks over and grabs a large practice stick, handing it to her.]
RONON
Hit me with that.
[She smiles as he settles next to her.]
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
[McKay smiles as he looks over the ocean, his hands in his pockets.
Sheppard joins him; this time McKay immediately notices.]
SHEPPARD
They're gone, Rodney.
MCKAY
Not all of them. Look.
[He points out where a whale is breaching the water nearby.]
SHEPPARD
Let me guess. Your buddy Sam.
MCKAY
Mmph. I like to think so. I like to think he's saying goodbye.
SHEPPARD
Makes sense. He saved your life, now you've saved his. Eh, you're
even.
[He slaps McKay on the back and walks away. McKay continues to look at
the ocean and smile.]
