EXT--ANTARCTICA, SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO, NIGHT
[A puddle jumper flies through the air heading towards the city ship of
Atlantis.]
INT--ATLANTIS OUTPOST CHAIR ROOM, SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO, NIGHT
[An Ancient man and woman exchange wordless, emotional gazes as the
jumper approaches the dock. She watches him depart with a wistful gaze,
then stares out the window towards the cityscape of Atlantis.]
EXT--ANTARCTICA, SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO, NIGHT
[Atlantis lifts off from the ground and flies into space.]
EXT--ANTARCTICA, PRESENT DAY, DAY
[The international research outpost is set up over the the Ancient
outpost chair room deep below.]
INT--ANTARCTIC OUPOST
[An elevator containing Dr. Weir lowers into the Ancient outpost.
Several personnel are milling around, conducting experiments. Grodin
studies an inactive drone weapon.]
TECHNICIAN
(over loudspeaker)
This is Operations. General O'Neill is inbound, 20 minutes out.
[Weir approaches Grodin.]
GRODIN
Dr. Weir.
WEIR
Peter.
[She watches him a moment, then heads toward the chair room.]
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST CHAIR ROOM
[Beckett stands up from the chair, arguing with McKay as Weir arrives.]
BECKETT
You see? Nothing.
[He leaves.]
MCKAY
Carson, get back here.
BECKETT
I could sit in that chair all bloody day long, and nothing will
happen. It's a waste of time.
(passing Weir)
Excuse me, Dr. Weir.
MCKAY
(arguing to Weir)
He's not even trying.
WEIR
He's the one who discovered the gene this technology responds to.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, he said he wished he never had it.
WEIR
(surprised)
Really?
MCKAY
I know. Can you believe that?
WEIR
(teasing)
We could always test you a third time, Rodney.
MCKAY
(unamused)
That's very funny.
WEIR
We have only found a handful of people who are genetically
compatible with the Ancient technology, and despite your heroic
efforts to interface ours with theirs, we need every one of them to
sit in this chair,including Dr. Beckett.
MCKAY
What am I supposed to do? He's afraid of the thing.
WEIR
This chair controls the most powerful weapons known to humankind.
I'm afraid of the thing. But every time someone sits in it, we learn
something new about the Ancients who built this outpost. Dr. Beckett
should be proud he's genetically advanced.
MCKAY
It's not more advanced. It is a random characteristic.
WEIR
(shrewdly)
This really bothers you, this whole gene thing, huh?
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Oh, clearly, I am overcome with envy.
[Daniel rushes in.]
DANIEL
Ah, just the people I need to see.
[He immediately turns and rushes away. McKay and Weir exchange looks.
Daniel doubles back and beckons them.]
DANIEL
Come with me.
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST LAB
[They follow Daniel into another room filled with computer monitors
showing gate addresses and paper star charts. Daniel stands by a
whiteboard covered with Stargate chevrons.]
DANIEL
We've gotten closer and closer to finding the location of the Lost
City, but it turns out we've been looking in the wrong place all
along. Now, we thought we had a stargate address--six symbols
representing coordinates in space that determined the location of
the planet the Ancients went to after they left Antarctica. Now,
recently, we determined a seventh symbol.
[He draws the symbol for Earth.]
WEIR
The point of origin, Earth.
DANIEL
That's not it.
MCKAY
Then your address must be incorrect.
DANIEL
Not incorrect. Incomplete.
[He draws another symbol on the chart between the sixth symbol and the
one for Earth.]
WEIR
(intrigued)
What are you saying, Dr. Jackson?
[Daniel labels the new symbol and Earth's with the numbers 7 and 8.]
DANIEL
It's an eight-symbol address. What we're looking for may be further
away than we ever imagined, but it's not out of reach.
MCKAY
Atlantis.
DANIEL
(nodding)
Atlantis. I think we can go there.

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
[A helicopter flies across the Antarctic landscape.]
INT--HELICOPTER
[Sheppard sits at the controls. O'Neill sits next to him.]
SHEPPARD
Apache, Blackhawk, Cobra, Osprey...
O'NEILL
It's a lot of training for the Antarctic.
SHEPPARD
It was the one continent I never set foot on.
O'NEILL
It's one of my least favorite continents.
SHEPPARD
I kind of like it here.
O'NEILL
(incredulous)
You like it here?
SHEPPARD
Yes, sir. Be there in about ten minutes, sir.
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST CHAIR ROOM AREA
[McKay herds Beckett back towards the chair.]
BECKETT
Look, we've been through this. I'm not your man.
MCKAY
Keep moving.
BECKETT
I'm a doctor. A medical doctor.
MCKAY
There's nothing to be afraid of.
BECKETT
You don't understand. I break things like this.
MCKAY
(insistent)
This device has survived for millions of years intact. It will
survive you. Now, sit down, close your eyes, and concentrate.
[Beckett sighs in resignation and sits in the chair. After a split
second he shrugs, frustrated, and starts to get up.]
BECKETT
Again, nothing.
[McKay signals for him to stay seated.]
MCKAY
Okay, this time just try to imagine an image of where we are in the
solar system.
[Skeptical, Beckett closes his eyes and concentrates.]
BECKETT
I think I feel something.
(opening his eyes)
It could be lunch-related.
MCKAY
(annoyed)
Shut up. And concentrate.
[Beckett grimaces, but complies, closing his eyes again in
concentration. The chair lights up and shoves backward. Beckett opens
his eyes, mouth agape in surprise.]
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST OUTER CHAMBER
[The drone Grodin has been studying suddenly activates, catching Grodin
by surprise.]
INT--ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM
[McKay and Beckett stare in shock and horror as the drone in the outer
room starts flying around the room.]
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST OUTER CHAMBER
[People everywhere dive out of the way as the drone ping-pongs out of
control throughout the chamber.]
WOMAN
Watch out!
[The drone finds the opening of the elevator shaft and flies up it.]
INT--ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM
BECKETT
What did I do?
INT--ANTARCTICA OUTPOST ELEVATOR SHAFT
[The cage elevator rising to the surface contains Weir, Daniel, and two
women. They see the lit drone streak past them, causing the elevator to
tremble.]
WEIR
Get us back down there!
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
[The drone bursts through the outpost roof and starts flying at high
speed through the sky.]
INT--HELICOPTER
TECHNICIAN
(over radio) All inbound craft, we have a rogue drone that could
seek a target on its own. Land immediately and shut down your
engines. This is not a drill. I repeat--
SHEPPARD
It's too late. Hang on.
[Sheppard barely avoids the drone that streaks around the helicopter
twice, locking onto the helicopter as a target.]
O'NEILL
Break right.
[Sheppard dodges the drone again by flying higher and to the left.]
O'NEILL
I said, right!
SHEPPARD
I'm getting to that, sir.
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST
[Daniel immediately runs toward the chair room. Weir pauses a moment,
taking in the devastation before running after Daniel.]
INT--ANCIENT ANTARCTIC CHAIR ROOM
[Weir runs up to Beckett her arms outstretched in bewilderment.]
BECKETT
I told you I was the wrong person.
MCKAY
It doesn't matter now. Just do something!
BECKETT
Like what?
WEIR
(soothingly)
Okay, Carson, concentrate on shutting that weapon down before it
hurts someone.
INT--HELICOPTER
[Sheppard looks through his windows searching for the drone.]
SHEPPARD
I can't see it.
O'NEILL
(sharply)
Pull up. Pull up!
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
[The helicopter barely misses a mountain ridge then dives down
underneath the erratic path of the drone.]
INT--ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM
[Beckett concentrates while sitting in the chair as everyone watches
him anxiously.]
INT--HELICOPTER
O'NEILL
What about now?
SHEPPARD
(breathless)
Now's good.
EXT--ANTARCTICA, DAY
[The helicopter skims over the surface. The drone piles into the snow.
The helicopter itself lands on a flat surface.]
INT--HELICOPTER
O'NEILL
(sharply)
Shut it down!
[Sheppard complies.]
SHEPPARD
(nervously)
Sir, what the hell was that?
O'NEILL
(holding up his hand)
Wait for it.
[They watch and wait. A few seconds later, the drone bursts out of the
snowbank, still at high speed, and heading straight for the
helicopter.]
SHEPPARD
Get out!
[The pair scramble out of the helicopter. Sheppard takes a belly-flop
into the snow. The drone powers down and slides to a stop mere inches
away from O'Neill.]
INT--ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM
[Beckett opens his eyes.]
BECKETT
I think I did it.
INT--HELICOPTER
[Sheppard and O'Neill warily reenter their helicopter.]
SHEPPARD
(breathlessly)
That was different.
O'NEILL
(resigned)
For me, not so much.
INT--ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM
[Lieutenant Aiden Ford runs into the room.]
FORD
Major Sheppard is reporting the drone appears to have been
incapacitated. General O'Neill's helicopter is unharmed, and on its
way again. Seven minutes out.
[Everyone sighs in relief.]
WEIR
Thank God.
BECKETT
Holy crap.
EXT--ANTARCTIC OUTPOST, DAY
INT--ANCIENT OUPOST
[O'Neill and Sheppard exit the elevator. Daniel hurries to greet them.]
DANIEL
Jack!
O'NEILL
(dryly)
Daniel. Warm welcome.
DANIEL
It wasn't me. How did you manage to--
O'NEILL
Keep my ass from getting blown out of the sky? The exceptional
flying of Major John Sheppard. He likes it here.
DANIEL
(bewildered)
Exceptional? You like it here?
O'NEILL
(pokes Daniel's chest)
What say we cut to the part where you start talking real fast?
DANIEL
Ah. Weir's in here.
O'NEILL
(to Sheppard)
Hey. Don't touch anything.
SHEPPARD
Yes, sir.
[O'Neill and Daniel leave Sheppard where he nervously looks around the
busy room. Scientists are back at their experiments or still cleaning
up the mess left by the drone.]
INT--ANCIENT OUPOST STAR-CHART ROOM
DANIEL
I figure the Ancients packed up their entire city and left somewhere
between five and ten million years ago.
O'NEILL
(humoring him)
In their...flying city?
DANIEL
Yes.
[O'Neill shoots Daniel an amused, skeptical look.]
DANIEL
What?
O'NEILL
"Flying city?"
DANIEL
Well, keeping in mind this is the race that built the Stargates.
They did everything big.
O'NEILL
So, why did they leave?
DANIEL
Why'd they leave? Um, who knows? We know the Ancients on Earth were
suffering from a plague. Um, maybe some of them were trying to start
over, seeding life in a new galaxy. Maybe that's what Ancients do.
The point is, we know where they went.
O'NEILL
Pegasus.
DANIEL
Yes, it's-it's the name of a dwarf galaxy in the local group.
MCKAY
After all that time, is there any hope of actually meeting them?
DANIEL
(looks to Weir)
Uh, well, who knows, but isn't that reason enough to go?
WEIR
Well, I've been choosing members for this expedition for months,
Doctor. I'm not the one who needs convincing.
O'NEILL
Well, I'm convinced. Have fun.
DANIEL
Uh, it-it's a little more complicated than that.
MCKAY
We need the "Zed-PM" to power the gate.
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
"Zee-PM". He's, uh, he's Canadian.
O'NEILL
(to McKay, half-mockingly)
I'm sorry.
MCKAY
Oh, "Zero-Point Module," General. The Ancient power source you
recovered from Praclarush Taonas and that's now powering the
outpost's defenses. I've since determined that it generates its
enormous power from vacuum energy derived from a self-contained
region of subspace time.
O'NEILL
That was a waste of a perfectly good explanation. The answer's no.
INT--ANTARCTIC OUTPOST, CHAIR ROOM AREA
[Sheppard wanders near the chair room, where he hears Beckett bragging
to a few scientists who are entranced by his tale.]
BECKETT
(chuckling)
The second I shut my eyes, I could see. I just felt this power that
I've never had before. I had it dancing all across the sky. It was
magical, it really was. I mean, well, they are lucky. I don't know
where it came from. I just tried to concentrate, and the drone shut
itself down.
[Sheppard sees Beckett speaking to two others next to the chair.]
SHEPPARD
So you were the one.
BECKETT
Me?
SHEPPARD
(angrily)
You're the one who fired that thing at me.
BECKETT
(placating)
Look, we're doing research, working with technology that's
light-years beyond us, and we make mistakes. I'm incredibly,
incredibly sorry.
SHEPPARD
(mollified)
Well, next time, just be a little more careful, okay?
BECKETT
That's what I said.
SHEPPARD
What the hell was that thing anyway?
BECKETT
You mean the drone?
[Sheppard nods.]
BECKETT
The weapon the Ancients built to defend this outpost.
SHEPPARD
The who?
BECKETT
(worried)
You do have security clearance to be here?
SHEPPARD
Yeah, yeah, General O'Neill just gave it to me.
BECKETT
(gulping in surprise)
Then you don't even know about the Stargate.
SHEPPARD
The what?
INT--ANCIENT OUPOST CHAMBER
DANIEL
Jack, you know that gating to another galaxy requires an enormous
amount of power.
O'NEILL
Yes, I do. Find another way.
DANIEL
There's no other way.
O'NEILL
Do you think there are more of these...zed things in Atlantis?
DANIEL
Yes, and who knows what else we could find. This isn't just some
other civilization we're talking about. These are the gate builders.
WEIR
The potential wealth of knowledge and technology&emdash;it outweighs
anything we've come across since we stepped through the Stargate.
O'NEILL
Well, with the amount of power you'll need to make this trek, odds
are it'll be one-way.
WEIR
Yes, we know. But the benefit to humanity is far greater than the
risk, General. And it is a risk that every one of my expedition
members is willing to take.
[O'Neill considers this.]
INT--ANCIENT OUPOST CHAIR ROOM
BECKETT
We think the gene was used as a sort of genetic key, if you will, so
that only their kind could operate certain dangerous or powerful
technologies.
SHEPPARD
So some people have the same genes as these Ancients?
BECKETT
The specific gene is very rare, but on the whole, they look very
much like we do. In fact, they were first. We're the second
evolution of this form, the Ancients having explored this galaxy for
millions of years before--
[He notices Sheppard is moving to sit in the chair.]
BECKETT
Major, please don't.
SHEPPARD
(sitting)
Come on, what are the odds of me having the same genes as these
guys?
[As soon as Sheppard sits down, the chair activates. Sheppard freezes
out of nervousness.]
BECKETT
(shocked)
Quite slim, actually.
(calling out)
Dr. Weir!
(to Sheppard)
Don't move.
[He runs out of the room. A few moments later. Weir, McKay, O'Neill and
Daniel return with him.]
WEIR
Who is this?
O'NEILL
(exasperated)
I said don't touch anything.
SHEPPARD
(protesting)
I just sat down.
MCKAY
Major, think about where we are in the solar system.
[After a moment, a three dimensional holographic image of the solar
system appears over their heads. Weir is elated. McKay is shocked.]
SHEPPARD
Did I do that?
EXT--ANCIENT OUTPOST SURFACE
INT--ANCIENT OUTPOST
[O'Neill and Weir walk through the facility.]
WEIR
We could be on our way to discovering an entirely new Ancient
civilization. The best case scenario, we meet actual Ancients who
are willing to help us, but if we don't...
[O'Neill becomes particularly distracted as they pass the stasis
chamber he had been trapped in for several months.]
WEIR
General, we need him.
O'NEILL
Sorry, Doc, I need Daniel here.
WEIR
I'm talking about Major Sheppard.
O'NEILL
Oh. Don't you have a dozen or so people already who can use the
Ancient technology?
WEIR
Yes, with concentration and training, they can make it work, but
John Sheppard, he does it naturally.
[They pause by the elevator.]
O'NEILL
You know, I've checked into his record.
WEIR
I know about the whole supposed black mark in Afghanistan. He was
trying to save the lives of three servicemen.
O'NEILL
Disobeying a direct order in the process.
WEIR
(ironically)
I have read your own file, General. Please.
O'NEILL
Right.
(sighing)
Okay, it's your expedition. You want him, you ask him.
WEIR
Uh, that's the thing. I have.
O'NEILL
(surprised)
Really?
INT--HELICOPTER
[Sheppard prepares for departure. O'Neill sits next to him.]
O'NEILL
This isn't a long trip, so I'll be as succinct as possible.
[He glares at Sheppard for several moments.]
SHEPPARD
Well, that's pretty succinct.
O'NEILL
Thank you.
SHEPPARD
I told Dr. Weir that, you know, I'd think about it.
O'NEILL
And? So? Well? What?
SHEPPARD
With all due respect, sir, we were just attacked by an alien
missile. And then I found out I have some mutant gene. Then there's
this "Stargate thing" and these expeditions to other galaxies.
O'NEILL
You know, this isn't about you, Sheppard. It's a lot bigger than
that.
SHEPPARD
Right now, at this very second, whether I decide to go on this
mission or not seems to be about me.
[He starts up the rotors and fixes his helmet.]
O'NEILL
Let me ask you something.
[He realizes Sheppard can no longer hear him and snags his own
headset.]
O'NEILL
(into headset)
Why'd you become a pilot?
SHEPPARD
I think people who don't want to fly are crazy.
O'NEILL
And I think people who don't want to go through the Stargate are
equally as whacked. Now, if you can't give me a yes by the time we
reach McMurdo, I don't even want you.
[Sheppard stares at O'Neill in shock.]
EXT--ANTARCTICA
[The helicopter flies across the sky.]
INT--SIMON'S LIVING ROOM
[Simon sits on a sofa and starts watching a video of Weir.]
WEIR
(over video)
Simon, if you're watching this, it means the President has been kind
enough to grant you security clearance. I'm not going on a
diplomatic mission to another country. I'm going to another planet
in another galaxy by means of a device called a Stargate.
BEGIN EXCERPTS
WEIR
(continuing video in voiceover)
Millions of years ago, there was a race of beings we call the
Ancients. They created a network of these Stargates throughout our
galaxy in order to travel freely among their worlds. We don't know
why, but they left for another galaxy somewhere between five and ten
million years ago, taking their entire city along with them. That
city was called Atlantis. I have been assembling an expedition team
in order to try to find Atlantis and hopefully, the Ancients who
left Earth all those years ago.
[While Weir speaks other scenes appear showing expedition members
preparing to leave. Ford kisses his grandparents goodbye before getting
into a taxi. Beckett sits down to a home-cooked meal in his mother's
kitchen, his mother doting on him. McKay leaves his cat with a
neighbor, complete with a supply of food. Sheppard sits on a hillside
in a park near a coastline, flipping a coin indecisively.]
END EXCERPTS
WEIR
(continuing on video)
I want to do this, Simon with all my heart. You know me well enough
to know I could never turn down an opportunity like this, but I
wanted the chance to tell you--
[Simon pauses the video and moves over to the phone. He dials a
number.]
OPERATOR
(over telephone)
The cellular customer you are trying to reach is currently outside
the coverage area.
[Simon hangs up.]
SIMON
No kidding.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--LEVEL 28, STARGATE COMMAND
[The corridors are crowded with expedition members move equipment
around, preparing for departure.]
CANADIAN EXPEDITION MEMBER
I narrowed it down to about three things, but after a week, it just
kind of fell into place...
[Grodin speaks Spanish to another member and pats him on the back.]
[In another area outside the Gate Room, a couple of expedition members
are speaking with Ford.]
FORD
(frustrated)
I don't under--does anyone else here speak whatever language these
guys are speaking?
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[More expedition members finish packing. Bates argues with Beckett.]
BECKETT
Listen, I just need a couple of minutes to finish my work, and
you're not helping by standing there.
[Sumner stands on the ramp, overseeing the progress. He walks past the
technicians working on the MALP.]
SUMNER
(to technicians)
You've got five minutes to get it going, or I'm leaving it.
[Sumner walks down the ramp towards Bates and Beckett.]
SUMNER
(to Beckett)
Everything in here has been double-checked and triple-checked and
cleared for takeoff. Leave it alone.
BECKETT
Look, Colonel, I don't answer to you.
BATES
He said the same to me, sir.
SUMNER
(to Bates)
That's what your sidearm's for.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Weir is among the expedition members working with SGC personnel to
prepare for departure. Daniel enters with an expedition member.]
DANIEL
So the eight-chevron address is what tells our gate to look for a
point in space outside of our galaxy, so we won't know until it
locks.
EXPEDITION SCIENTIST
Okay.
[O'Neill enters from the stairwell with a jaunty step.]
O'NEILL
Are we there yet?
WEIR
We're just waiting on Dr. McKay.
INT--SGC POWER ROOM
[McKay and Siler work on hooking up a generator device to the power
grid. McKay holds a ZPM.]
SILER
It should work now. I've got it.
MCKAY
Okay, Sergeant, give it a try. The ZPM should light up when it
senses a conductive connection to the gate.
[McKay plugs in the ZPM. Siler pulls a lever. The ZPM activates.]
MCKAY
(pleased)
Oh, yeah.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Sheppard heads into the Gate Room, watching the bustle of activity.]
SHEPPARD
(to Sumner)
Colonel.
[Sumner stares at Sheppard coldly. Sheppard is disappointed in the
scrutiny. Weir enters.]
WEIR
Can I have everyone's attention, please? All right, here we go.
We're about to try to make a connection. We have been unable to
predict exactly how much power this is going to take, and we may
only get the one chance at this. So if we're able to achieve a
stable wormhole, we're not going to risk shutting the 'gate down.
We'll send in the MALP robot probe, check for viability, and go.
Everything in one shot. Now, every one of you volunteered for this
mission, and you represent over a dozen countries. You are the
world's best and brightest. And in light of the adventure we are
about to embark on, you're also the bravest. I hope we all return
one day having discovered a whole new realm for humanity to explore.
But as all of you know, we may never be able to return home. I'd
like to offer you all one last chance to withdraw your
participation.
[No one responds.]
WEIR
Begin the dialing sequence.
[She steps off the ramp.]
SUMNER
(low, to Sheppard)
Let me make myself clear, Major. You are not here by my choice.
SHEPPARD
I'm sure you'll warm up to me once you get to know me, sir.
SUMNER
As long as you remember who's giving the orders.
[Sheppard smirks.]
SHEPPARD
That would be Dr. Weir, right?
[Sumner glares. Sheppard smiles and rolls his eyes as he turns away.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[Weir rejoins O'Neill and Daniel in the room.]
TECHNICIAN
Chevron Three encoded. Chevron Four encoded.
O'NEILL
Nice.
WEIR
Thank you.
TECHNICIAN
Chevron Five encoded.
[McKay rushes in and joins the other.]
TECHNICIAN
Chevron Six encoded.
WEIR
(nervous and excited)
This is it.
MCKAY
(quietly)
Yeah.
WEIR
(teasingly)
Seriously, Doctor, calm down. You're embarrassing me.
MCKAY
(drily)
I've never been so excited in my entire life.
TECHNICIAN
Chevron Eight is locked.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The Stargate activates. Everyone applauds.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[O'Neill squelches a pleased smile.]
WEIR
Send the MALP.
[The technician sends a command code. and the MALP enters the Stargate.
A dark image appears on the monitor.]
TECHNICIAN
We have MALP telemetry.
WEIR
What is it we're looking at?
[McKay joins the technician at the controls.]
TECHNICIAN
Switching to zero locks.
MCKAY
The radar indicates...a large room?
DANIEL
(incredulous)
Structurally intact?
MCKAY
Environmental sensors say there's oxygen, no measurable toxins. We
have viable life support. It looks like we're not getting out of
this.
[He smiles and leaves. Weir smiles and turns to O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Dr. Weir, you have a go.
WEIR
Thank you...sir.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Sumner and an initial team head up the ramp.]
SUMNER
(shouting)
Let's go, people. We don't know how much power we've got. Security
teams One and Two, you're up first. All other personnel will follow
on our signal. Once on the other side, keep moving, clear the
debarkation area. On my lead...
WEIR
(entering)
Hold on, Colonel!
(snagging her pack)
We go through together.
SUMNER
Fair enough.
[Sumner readies his weapon and leads his team through. Weir pauses a
moment and looks back at O'Neill and Daniel in the Gate Room. She nods
a farewell, then steps through the Stargate.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
DANIEL
(wistful)
Jack, it-it's not too late for me--
O'NEILL
(flatly)
No.
DANIEL
I can just grab my--
O'NEILL
No.
DANIEL
...kit.
SUMNER
(over radio)
All clear. It looks good.
O'NEILL
(into intercom)
Expedition team...move out.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Sheppard and Ford are next in line to go through the Stargate.]
SHEPPARD
(nervous)
What's it feel like?
[Ford takes stock of Sheppard.]
FORD
Hurts like hell, sir.
[Sheppard grimaces, readying himself. Ford breaks out into a grin and
leaps backward into the event horizon.]
FORD
Whoo-hoo!
[Sheppard pauses, wincing, then steps through, eyes closed.]
WORMHOLE EFFECT
[The wormhole is green in color as it heads to the Pegasus Galaxy.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard comes out of the wormhole and looks back in shock. He readies
his weapon though in the strange environment.]
SUMNER
Teams One and Two, secure the immediate area.
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Personnel start to push equipment through the Stargate.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sumner heads towards a door, which opens automatically as he
approaches. He turns back.]
SUMNER
(shouting)
Everyone else, find an open space and park it until instructed
otherwise.
[Weir stares around. She notices how the steps light up as Sheppard and
McKay start to walk up them.]
WEIR
Who's doing that?
SUMNER
(into radio)
Security teams, any alien contact?
TEAM
Negative, sir.
TEAM
Team Four, negative, Colonel.
[At the top of the stairwell, Sheppard heads towards the control room,
and the lights activate there.]
SHEPPARD
The lights are coming on by themselves.
[He and McKay start to explore the room as more personnel arrive with
equipment.]
SUMNER
That's everyone.
WEIR
(into radio)
General O'Neill? Atlantis base offers greetings from the Pegasus
Galaxy. You may cut power to the 'gate.
[A bottle of champagne rolls through the Stargate as the wormhole
deactivates. Weir picks it up. A tag on the neck reads. "Bon
Voyage--Gen. Jack O'Neill".]
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Some people enter the conference room.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Lights activate as people explore.]
INT--JUMPER BAY
[Two scientists enter a room filled with several small craft docked
inside.]
SCIENTIST 1
(excited)
They look like ships. Spaceships!
SCIENTIST 2
I love it.
[They move further into the room and see there's more than one level of
the small ships as the lights come on.]
SCIENTIST 1
(into radio)
Dr. Weir, you have to see this.
INT--OFFICE
[Weir sets her bag down in the room off the control room (that will
become her office).]
WEIR
(into radio)
I have a lot of things to see. Just be careful.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir walks the catwalk back into the control room where McKay,
Sheppard, and others are taking sheets off the stations and looking at
devices. As Sheppard walks by a monitor it lights up.]
SHEPPARD
(protesting)
I didn't touch anything.
WEIR
Relax, Major. It's like the entire complex is sensing our presence
and coming to life.
MCKAY
This has got to be the control room. This is obviously their version
of a DHD.
SHEPPARD
(sarcastic)
Oh, obviously.
MCKAY
(moving to another console)
This area could be power control systems, possibly a computer
interface--
WEIR
Hey, hey. Why don't you find out?
MCKAY
Right.
SUMNER
(over radio)
Dr. Weir, Colonel Sumner. Could you come down and meet me, please?
We're three levels down from you.
WEIR
Right away.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir and Sheppard join Sumner.]
SUMNER
We've only been able to secure a fraction of the place. It's huge.
WEIR
So it might really be the lost city of Atlantis?
SUMNER
I'd say that's a good bet.
[He leads them to a glass door.]
WEIR
Oh, my God.
[They stare at the strange green setting. Above them, they can see
sunlight peeking through the surface of waves.]
WEIR
We're underwater.
SUMNER
I'd say we're under several hundred feet of ocean. If we can't dial
out, this could be a problem.
[McKay arrives.]
MCKAY
Colonel, Dr. Weir--
SHEPPARD
(excited)
We're underwater.
MCKAY
Yes, I was just coming to tell you. Fortunately, there's some sort
of a force field holding back the wa&emdash; (he slows, looking at
the scene)
...water. Oh, that is impressive, isn't it? Uh, Dr. Beckett has
found something you should, uh, see.
[They follow him.]
INT--HOLOGRAM ROOM
[A holographic Ancient woman speaks on a platform. Weir, Sumner,
Sheppard, and McKay enter. Beckett stands by the console.]
ANCIENT WOMAN HOLOGRAM
...in the hope of spreading new life in a galaxy where there
appeared to be none. Soon, the new life grew and prospered. Here...
BECKETT
(excited)
It's a hologram. The recording loops. This is my second time
through.
SUMNER
What have we missed?
BECKETT
Not much.
ANCIENT WOMAN HOLOGRAM
(continuing)
...exchange knowledge and friendship. In time, a thousand worlds
bore the fruit of life in this form. Then one day, our people set
foot upon a dark world where a terrible enemy slept.
[Over her head an image of the galaxy with individual star systems
appear.]
ANCIENT WOMAN HOLOGRAM
Never before had we encountered beings with powers that rivaled our
own. In our overconfidence, we were unprepared and outnumbered. The
enemy fed upon the defenseless human worlds like a great scourge,
until finally, only Atlantis remained.
[The stars turn red to show the spread of the terrible enemy throughout
the galaxy.]
ANCIENT WOMAN HOLOGRAM
This city's great shield was powerful enough to withstand their
terrible weapons, but here we were besieged for many years. In an
effort to save the last of our kind, we submerged our great city
into the ocean. The Atlantis Stargate was the one and only link back
to Earth from this galaxy, and those who remained used it to return
to that world that was once home. There, the last survivors of
Atlantis lived out the remainder of their lives. This city was left
to slumber, in the hope that our kind would one day return.
[The hologram stops speaking, and Beckett steps away from the console.
She disappears.]
MCKAY
Huh. So the story of Atlantis is true. A great city that sank in the
ocean.
BECKETT
It just didn't happen on Earth.
MCKAY
Well, the Ancient Greeks must have heard it from one of the
surviving Ancients.
SUMNER
I don't like the fact they got their asses kicked.
[Grodin enters and whispers to McKay. Beckett steps to the console,
activating the hologram.]
BECKETT
Let's see again from the beginning.
MCKAY
(nervously)
Stop. Turn it off.
[Nonplussed, Beckett steps back.]
MCKAY
Power levels throughout the city are dropping like a stone.
SUMNER
What does that mean?
MCKAY
That if we don't stop everything we're doing right now, we are dead.
[McKay hurries out with Grodin. Puzzled, everyone else follows.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Everyone is now back in the control room. McKay works on his
computer.]
BECKETT
(nervous)
Please tell me this is not my fault.
MCKAY
(rolling his eyes)
No.
BECKETT
Thank you.
MCKAY
From what we've been able to ascertain, the city is powered by three
Zero-Point Modules. Two are entirely depleted, and the third is
reaching maximum entropy. When it does, it will die too, and nothing
can reverse that.
SUMNER
Just tell me the bottom line.
MCKAY
The force field holding back the ocean has collapsed to its minimum
sustainable levels. Look, you can see here and here where the
shield's already failed and the city's flooded. It could've happened
years ago. but... This section is likely more protected because of
the Stargate.
SHEPPARD
What if it fails completely?
MCKAY
It's a matter of "when," not "if."
WEIR
Colonel Sumner, you need to order your security teams to stop
searching the city immediately.
SUMNER
(into radio)
All security teams, fall back to the gate room.
MCKAY
That's not going to be good enough.
WEIR
All right, well, how much time do we have?
MCKAY
It's hard to say. Hours, maybe days, if we minimize power
expenditure.
BECKETT
What about our own power generators?
MCKAY
We're working on that, but even with our most advanced,
naquadah-powered generators, the equations are coming up far short.
WEIR
So we need to find more ZPMs.
SUMNER
How do we do that if we can't search the city?
MCKAY
If there were more here, we'd be able to detect them.
SUMNER
Can we use the Stargate?
MCKAY
There's nowhere near enough power to open a wormhole back to Earth.
SHEPPARD
Maybe somewhere in this galaxy.
MCKAY
(considering)
Well, that's relatively easy. Fortunately, some Ancient technology
still uses good, old-fashioned push buttons, so we've been able to
access the Stargate control system and a library of known gate
addresses in the database.
GRODIN
That's not all. Look at this.
[Pleased, he pushes a button. A shield encompasses the Stargate.]
SUMNER
Just like the Iris on the Earth gate.
MCKAY
(nervously)
Using power, using power, using power...
[Grodin powers down the shield.]
WEIR
Well, at least we don't have to deal with any uninvited guests.
Colonel, assemble a team. We need safe harbor, or better still,
another power source.
SUMNER
(into radio)
Lieutenant Ford, gather security teams One and Two. Everyone gear
up.
WEIR
(to Sheppard)
Major, I'd like you to go along.
SHEPPARD
Yes, ma'am.
WEIR
(to McKay)
All right, pick an address. Start dialing.
[McKay presses a key. The Stargate whirs to life and one chevron lights
up.]
MCKAY
(with pomp)
Chevron one encoded.
[Weir closes her eyes.]
WEIR
(impatient)
Rodney...
MCKAY
Fine.
[McKay dials the rest of the address in quick succession and the
Stargate whirs to activation.]
GRODIN
Ready MALP Four for off-world recon.
[McKay hits the center control, and the Stargate activates.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Sumner's team readies at the event horizon. Grodin runs down the
stairs and stands nearby studying a display.]
GRODIN
The MALP reads full viability and no immediate signs of activity
around the Stargate, but it's pitch black. For now, we're going to
use the tried and true system for identification of inbound gate
travelers.
[Sheppard joins Sumner's team, readying his infrared goggles, which
everyone else already wears. Sumner glances at Weir who nods her
approval.]
SUMNER
Let's move out!
[They step through the Stargate. Sheppard waves farewell at Weir before
walking through.]
INT--ATHOS, NIGHT
[The teams spread out and reconnoiter the field where they've arrived.
Sheppard hears a twig snap and he motions Ford to hold. They check out
the movement. A figure enters Ford's field of vision; he raises and
readies his weapon. The figure, a young boy, stares in fear at Ford.
Another boy wearing a scary mask pounces on the first figure in a
tackle, not noticing Ford.]
JINTO
(panicked)
Please, don't hurt us.
[Both boys stare in fear at Ford. Sheppard arrives. A tall man runs
towards the children.]
HALLING
Please! They're just playing.
[Sumner approaches.]
SUMNER
Is everything okay here, Sheppard?
SHEPPARD
Yes, sir. Just a couple of kids.
[Halling rises to his full height, which is several inches taller than
Sumner. Sumner raises his weapon in a guarded, but not threatening
manner. Halling gathers the boys close to him. He turns to Sheppard and
gestures to himself.]
HALLING
Halling.
SHEPPARD
I don't know what that means.
SUMNER
(annoyed)
It's his name.
SHEPPARD
Oh. Halling, it's nice to meet you.
HALLING
Are you here to trade?
SHEPPARD
Trade. Yes. We're tr-traders.
HALLING
(to Jinto)
Now, how many times have I told you not to play in the forest after
dark? I'm just glad you're safe.
[They touch foreheads and Halling rises again.]
HALLING
(to Sheppard)
Teyla will wish to meet with you. Come.
SUMNER
(to Parker and Smitty)
Parker, Smitty, you're on gate duty. Dial Atlantis base and let the
good doctor know we've made contact with the indigenous people.
[Sumner, Ford, Sheppard, and others follow Halling.]
FORD
Sir, if you don't mind my asking...I noticed you've got a problem
with Major Sheppard.
SUMNER
My problem, Lieutenant, is with his record. I don't like anybody who
doesn't follow the proper chain of command.
FORD
Yes, sir.
[Jinto walks with Sheppard.]
JINTO
What was that mask you had on?
SHEPPARD
It helps you see in the dark. Check it out.
[He hands his infrared goggles to Jinto, who puts them on.]
JINTO
Whoa.
WEX
Let me see.
(he looks)
Whoa. Can I have it?
[Sheppard takes the goggles back.]
SHEPPARD
No. What's the mask you got on?
WEX
This? Wraith.
SHEPPARD
Wraith? What's that?
WEX
(surprised)
You don't know?
JINTO
(incredulous)
What world do you come from?
WEX
Can we go there?
SHEPPARD
I'm afraid not. I come from a galaxy far, far away.
[They arrive at a settlement of several tents, campfires burning.]
INT--DINING TENT
[Several people sit around a table drinking from mugs. One is small
woman with long hair, Teyla. Halling calls out from outside.]
HALLING
It's Halling. I bring men from away.
TEYLA
(smiling)
Enter.
[Halling, Sumner, Ford, and Sheppard enter. Teyla stands, frowning at
the strangers' odd outfits and weapons.]
HALLING
These men wish to trade.
[Sheppard nervously pulls off his goggles and ruffles his hair, which
only makes it look more unkempt.]
SHEPPARD
(with charming smile)
Oh, it's...it's nice to meet you.
TEYLA
I am Teyla Emmagan, daughter of Tagan.
SUMNER
(nodding to each team member)
Colonel Marshall Sumner, Major Sheppard, Lieutenant Ford. We have
very few specific needs.
TEYLA
(sternly)
We do not trade with strangers.
SUMNER
Is that a fact?
SHEPPARD
Well, then, we'll just, uh...we'll have to get to know each other.
Me, um, I like Ferris wheels and college football, anything that
goes more than 200 miles per hour.
FORD
(low, to Sheppard)
Sir, that's not going to mean anything to them.
SHEPPARD
(low to Ford)
Feel free to speak up. I'm just trying to break the ice here.
SUMNER
(low, to Sheppard)
These people can't help us. I'd rather not waste the time.
TEYLA
Each morning, before dawn, our people drink a stout tea to brace us
for the coming day. Will you join us?
SHEPPARD
(stepping forward)
I love a good cup of tea. Now, there's another thing you know about
me.
(to Sumner)
We're practically friends already.
[Ford looks to Sumner. Who quirks an eyebrow and smiles at Sheppard's
tactics despite himself.]
EXT--ATHOS SETTLEMENT, DAWN
[Sumner approaches Bates, who's looking through binoculars at something
in the distance.]
BATES
We didn't even know it was there until the sun came up.
[Sumner looks through the binoculars at the ruins of an Ancient city
across the bog.]
SUMNER
Looks more promising than anything else these folks have to offer.
Plenty of shelter, nice, little valley. Location, location,
location.
[He hands the binoculars back to Bates.]
INT--TENT
[Sumner has returned to the tent.]
TORAN
The city of the Ancestors is not safe.
SUMNER
We can handle ourselves.
TORAN
The Wraith will come.
SUMNER
Who are these Wraith?
TEYLA
(warily)
We have never met anyone who did not know.
SUMNER
Well, you have now.
TEYLA
If the Wraith have never touched your world, you should go back
there now.
SHEPPARD
Oh, we'd like to, but we can't. See, here's the thing, ma'am. We've
got ourselves into a bit of a bind, and we may need a safe place to
stay for a while.
TEYLA
Our people have long believed that the Wraith will come if we
venture into the old city. But it is a belief we've not tested in
some time.
SUMNER
(to his team)
Gentlemen.
[He leads them out of the tent to talk privately.]
EXT--ATHOS SETTLEMENT, DAWN
SUMNER
Look, I don't care what they say. That city is worth a look, not to
mention the possibility there could be ZPMs there that they don't
know or care about.
SHEPPARD
What if the Wraith are the enemy the Ancient hologram lady is
talking about?
SUMNER
All the more reason for us to have a defensible position should we
have to abandon Atlantis.
(to Sheppard)
Stay here and find out what you can.
(to Ford)
Ford, you head back to the gate and report in to Weir. Tell her
we'll have answers for her in a few hours.
FORD
Yes, sir.
INT--ATHOS TENT
[Sheppard rejoins Teyla and Toran.]
SHEPPARD
Well, I guess it's just you and me...And him.
TEYLA
(nodding towards Sumner)
Your leader looks through me as if I were not there.
SHEPPARD
Do I?
TEYLA
No. You truly cannot return to your world?
SHEPPARD
No.
TEYLA
Then there is something you should see.
INT--ATHOS FOREST
[Teyla leads Sheppard over an embankment.</blockquote>
SHEPPARD
How much further is this place?
TEYLA
Not far.
[Sheppard falls down the embankment, but tries to look suave. Teyla
grins.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Tell me some good news, Rodney.
MCKAY
I can't do that.
WEIR
The shield has held back the ocean for centuries.
MCKAY
And probably would've kept going for years more, but our arrival
changed that. Now it's nothing more than a thin shell between the
buildings and the water.
WEIR
We stopped exploring.
MCKAY
The damage was already done. Another section of the city, on the far
side, was flooded an hour or so ago.
GRODIN
Even occupying this room is draining power.
MKCAY
We need to evacuate the moment Colonel Sumner reports back it's
safe.
WEIR
You're saying we have to abandon the city?
[The city creaks.]
MCKAY
The sooner we leave, the longer that shield holds.
[Weir sighs.]
INT--CAVE
[Teyla leads Sheppard into a cave.]
TEYLA
I used to play here as a child. I believe this is where the
survivors hid from the Wraith during the last great attack.
SHEPPARD
Let me, uh...
[He tries to start a Zippo lighter. Teyla uses an advanced device to
light a torch and looks at him with a smug smile.]
TEYLA
We mastered fire long ago.
SHEPPARD
I guess so.
[Sheppard replaces his lighter. She leads him into another chamber.
Sheppard catches the light reflecting on a shiny object. He picks up a
pendant.]
SHEPPARD
What's this?
TEYLA
(surprised)
I lost this years ago. How did you--
SHEPPARD
It was just lying right over there. It was reflecting off the light.
[He helps her put it on. She looks at it while Sheppard notices the
walls. They're covered with pictograms.]
SHEPPARD
Someone's been busy, huh?
TEYLA
The drawings in the caves are extensive. Many must date back
thousands of years or more.
SHEPPARD
Does this represent the destruction of your city?
TEYLA
This drawing far predates that.
SHEPPARD
So, what? Someone knew it was going to happen?
TEYLA
I believe it happens...again and again. The Wraith allow our kind to
grow in numbers, and when that number reaches a certain point, they
return to...cull their human herd. Sometimes, a few hundred years
will pass before they awaken again. We've visited many, many worlds.
I know of none untouched by the Wraith. The last great holocaust was
five generations ago, but still, they return in smaller numbers, to
remind us of their power.
SHEPPARD
That's a hell of a way to live.
TEYLA
We move our hunting camps around. We try to teach our children not
to live in fear, but it is hard. Some of us can sense the Wraith
coming. That gives us warning. We should go. It will be dark soon.
EXT--ATHOS, NEAR STARGATE, NIGHT
FORD
Man, days are short here.
SUMNER
(over radio)
Major Sheppard, this is Colonel Sumner. Come in.
FORD
(into radio)
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Ford. Major Sheppard is out of radio
range at the moment.
SUMNER
(over radio, arriving at settlement)
Where the hell is he?
FORD
(into radio)
I think Teyla wanted him to see something.
[The Stargate activates with an incoming wormhole.]
FORD
Defensive positions.
(into radio)
Colonel, we have gate activity here.
[He pulls off his goggles as three small fighter-like aircraft fly
through (Wraith darts).]
FORD
Colonel, three bandits headed your way.
EXT--ATHOS SETTLEMENT
SUMNER
Take cover!
[A woman screams as people panic and scatter. One falls.]
SUMNER
Get up.
EXT--ATHOS FOREST
[Teyla pauses while leading Sheppard through the forest. She listens in
the distance.]
SHEPPARD
What is it?
TEYLA
The Wraith.
[They run.]
EXT--FOREST NEAR SETTLEMENT, NIGHT
[The Athosians race to evacuate.]
WOMAN
Just leave it.
[Halling searches for his son.]
HALLING
Jinto, come. Jinto.
[Sumner warily looks around the camp, spotting the ship making a pass
overhead. He jogs towards the woods. He sees Halling and some other
Athosians jogging towards him, then getting swept up in an energy beam
from the ship and completely disappearing.]
SUMNER
(shouting)
Fire on that target!
[He and others fire their rifles at the ship as it loops to make
another pass. Around them, they spot wisps of movement, unformed ghosts
that disappear before they can focus on them.]
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
[Teyla races back to the settlement. Sheppard struggles to keep up.]
SHEPPARD
Teyla!
BATES
(over radio)
Colonel, they're on the ground. They're all around us.
[Sheppard turns to follow Teyla at a fork in the path, but can no
longer see her. He hears a Wraith ship pass over head.]
SHEPPARD
(warily)
Teyla?
[He hears wisps of movement the same as Sumner did at camp. He fires at
one as it dissipates. He aims at another, but Teyla steps through it,
breaking the illusion.]
TEYLA
They are not really there.
[Sheppard lowers his weapon and approaches, nonplussed.]
TEYLA
Do not trust your eyes. The Wraith can make you see things that are
not there. We must hurry.
[They continue to run towards the settlement.]
EXT--ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NIGHT
[The Wraith ship comes around again, firing blasts at the settlement.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Colonel, this is Sheppard. What you see on the ground is just an
illusion. Concentrate your fire on the ships.
SUMNER
(yelling around him)
Fire at the ships! Fire at the ships!
[Several of his command follow his orders, ceasing their aim at the
wisps and shooting at the ships. Sumner moves over to Bates, who's
frozen at the illusions, still holding his bazooka.]
SUMNER
(shaking him)
Bates, snap out of it!
BATES
They're everywhere, sir.
[Sumner drags him over to an open spot and points to a ship.]
SUMNER
Take that thing down!
[Bates follows orders and blasts the ship out of the sky. Sumner and
Bates are both immediately swept up by a beam from another ship.]
EXT--FOREST, NIGHT
[A beam chases Sheppard and Teyla through the forest. Sheppard dives
right, but Teyla gets swept up in the beam. Sheppard turns around and
gets up, but all is quiet.]
SHEPPARD
Teyla. Teyla?
STACKHOUSE
(over radio)
Sir, the Colonel's been taken.
[Sheppard runs towards the settlement.]
EXT--STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT
[The DHD begins to activate. Ford, taking cover behind it, spots the
chevrons lighting.]
FORD
(into radio)
The 'gate's coming on again. Two enemy ships approaching.
[The Stargate activates.]
SHEPPARD
Let them go. There are friendlies onboard. Look at the dialing
device. Burn those symbols into your mind.
[The two ships pass through the Stargate. Ford nervously stares at the
DHD, looking at the address lit.]
EXT--FOREST NEAR SETTLEMENT, NIGHT
[Sheppard comes across the wreckage of the ship Bates took down. He
sees a forearm of a Wraith, detached from the rest of the body, but
still crawling on its own.]
SHEPPARD
Son of a...
[Sheppard shoots the arm. Jinto runs up.]
JINTO
Help! Help me.
[They both look down at the arm. It's no longer moving.]
JINTO
I can't find my father.
[Sheppard clutches Jinto's shoulder.]
INT--ATLANTIS ALCOVE, UNDERWATER
[Grodin stands by a window looking at the city, holding a scanner. Weir
comes up next to him.]
GRODIN
Here it comes.
WEIR
What am I looking for?
[Part of the city glows for a moment with a strange clunking noise, and
bubbles erupt.]
GRODIN
There. Another part of the force field just failed. I don't think we
have much time.
[Weir sighs nervously.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay wanders the panels. Weir enters.]
WEIR
How are we doing? If we can just buy ourselves another day, maybe we
could--
MCKAY
(interrupting)
The city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these
main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
WEIR
Not in my wildest dreams did I hope to find the lost city of the
Ancients so completely untouched, so pristine, and we have no choice
but to walk away from this?
MCKAY
In order to save it.
WEIR
To save it for whom? We don't have enough power to send a message.
As far as Earth is concerned, we're just going to be missing,
presumed lost.
MCKAY
We'll be back. We'll find a power source somewhere in Pegasus.
WEIR
We have yet to hear from Colonel Sumner. We've got no idea what's
out there.
MCKAY
We can't wait. It is time to go, now.
[Weir steps out to the balcony and keys her handheld radio.)
WEIR
(into radio)
Attention, all personnel. This is Weir.
[A heavy rumbling begins to sound and shake the area. Grodin and McKay
stumble for controls.]
WEIR
(continuing into radio)
Stand by for immediate evacuation.
(to McKay)
Dial the gate.
[McKay starts to dial, but another signal comes in too fast.]
MAKAY
We've got an incoming wormhole.
[The shield automatically goes up.]
GRODIN
I'm reading Lieutenant Ford's identification code.
WEIR
Let 'em in.
[Sheppard leads a group of Athosians through and starts to herd them in
the 'Gate Room.]
SHEPPARD
Step in, folks. Move away from the puddle.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Weir hurries down the staircase to meet Sheppard.]
WEIR
Major Sheppard! Major Sheppard, who are these people?
SHEPPARD
Survivors from the settlement. We were attacked. Sumner and some of
our men were taken. What's going on?
[He stares around at the shaking city. Weir pulls him further away from
the refugees.]
WEIR
We are in no position to help anyone right now.
SHEPPARD
What the hell's going on here?
WEIR
We were about to abandon the city.
SHEPPARD
Going back there is a really bad idea.
WEIR
Major Sheppard, the shield is about to fail, and the ocean is about
to come crashing in on us. Do you have a better place for us to go?
SHEPPARD
Jinto, you have any other address we can gate to?
JINTO
Yes, many.
WEIR
He's just a boy.
JINTO
I am Jinto.
[Sheppard grabs Jinto by the arm and herds him up to the control room.]
SHEPPARD
She's pleased to meet you.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
The shield is collapsing!
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN
[The city shakes free of the ocean bottom, knocking several of the
inhabitants off their feet. It rises slowly.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[People help each other to their feet. Grodin heads to the city's DHD.]
GRODIN
I'm dialing an address.
WEIR
(calling from below)
No, wait.
MCKAY
She's right.
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN
[The city continues to rise from the depths of the ocean.]
INT--ATLANTIS
SHEPPARD
We're moving!
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY
[The city breaks through the surface. Daylight streams through the
windows as the city continues to reach for the sky.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL AND GATE ROOM
[Everyone looks on in wonder at the light around them. Systems again
turn on. Sheppard, Jinto, Weir, McKay, Grodin, and Ford move to a
window. They watch as the lower portions of the city break through the
surface.]
FORD
We're on the surface.
WEIR
I was hoping for another day. It looks like we just got a whole lot
more than that. Let's not waste it.
[Sheppard smiles and nods.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[A wave continues to expand outward from the city as it settles on the
surface.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Ford walks amongst the Athosians and expedition members, taking
command.]
FORD
People, listen up. No one gets to sit down until they clear two
pieces of equipment off this deck. Now, let's go.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard, Weir, Grodin, and McKay are up in the control room.]
MCKAY
The last Zero-Point Module is depleted, but limited power has
returned now that our own generators aren't going to hold back an
ocean. Life support systems are working, but the planet's atmosphere
is breathable, well, notwithstanding the inevitable allergens.
WEIR
So now could our naquadah generator supply enough power to the
shield for defensive purposes?
MCKAY
Not even close.
SHEPPARD
On the surface without a shield? We're target practice.
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
I'm acutely aware of that, Major, but thank you for reinforcing it.
SHEPPARD
When can you tell me where the Wraith took Colonel Sumner and the
others?
MCKAY
Even with the six symbols Lieutenant Ford provided there are still
hundreds of permutations--
SHEPPARD
(interrupting)
720.
MCKAY
(nonplussed)
Yes. I knew that, of course. I'm just surprised you did.
SHEPPARD
Take away the coordinates you can't get a lock on, and that's your
one, and when you find it, send a MALP.
[McKay steps away. Weir approaches.]
WEIR
Major? A word.
[He follows her to the back of the control room. As Weir nears what she
thought was a window, the door to a balcony opens, surprising them all.
Sheppard and Weir cautiously step outside.]
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
WEIR
Wow.
[They both look down over the railing, marveling at the sight of the
city.]
SHEPPARD
Let me guess. You're not going to let me rescue my people.
WEIR
Major, you don't even know if they're alive.
SHEPPARD
You don't leave people in the hands of the enemy. And the fact that
we are having this conversation in private lets me know that you
know damn well that it's wrong and it will totally undermine your
leadership. So as ranking military officer--
WEIR
(interrupting)
All right, just shut up and listen to me for a moment, all right?
Come on, what do we know about the Wraith? One of the few things we
do know is that they are the enemy that defeated the Ancients. When
we first began to use the stargate we found on Earth, we got
ourselves into serious trouble. Why?
SHEPPARD
I don't need a history lesson.
WEIR
Because the people in charge didn't consider the ramifications
before they reacted.
SHEPPARD
They took our people. How am I supposed to react?
WEIR
And we're defenseless! You said so yourself.
WEIR
How do you know going off on some half-assed rescue mission isn't
going to bring them all right back here to our doorstep?
SHEPPARD
(insistent)
Maybe it will...but it's the right thing to do. Why? Because it is.
WEIR
John--
SHEPPARD
(angry)
If we're not going to do this, and I mean right now, let's just turn
tail and pack up, because they're coming.
WEIR
You don't know that.
SHEPPARD
Our people are in the hands of the enemy, Doctor. Do you know what
that means? It is just a matter of time before the Wraith figure out
that this is the base of our operation.
WEIR
I just need more information. I mean, who knows? Maybe we could
negotiate a peaceful--
SHEPPARD
(incredulous)
Peaceful? Are you kidding? We weren't there for more than a few
hours before they showed up.
WEIR
Is it possible they came because of you? And that one of these
people you brought back here with you tipped them off?
SHEPPARD
(dismissively)
It's possible.
WEIR
See, that is exactly the kind of snap decision I'm referring to.
SHEPPARD
They're not all bad people, and you know, if we're going to stick
around here, we need friends.
WEIR
(nodding)
Okay, I see your point. Now, you see mine. I will not authorize a
rescue mission unless I am sure there's at least a remote chance of
success. I'm not sending more good people, including you, to their
deaths.
SHEPPARD
Okay.
[He leaves Weir alone on the balcony.]
INT--WRAITH HOLDING CELL
[Teyla awakens to find herself in a cell with some of her people and
Sumner and Bates.]
TORAN
Are you all right?
TEYLA
Where are we?
SUMNER
Any idea what to expect?
TEYLA
No.
SUMNER
Your friend was the one who said the Wraith would come if we went
down into the ruins.
HALLING
Perhaps you should have heeded his warning.
SUMNER
How do I know he's not the one who told them?
[Footsteps approach.]
HALLING
Someone comes.
[They back away from the cell door as a Wraith and two warrior guards
approach. The main Wraith is a tall humanoid with pale skin of a
greenish hue. Its hair is white and its features gaunt. It has a
mustache. A slit is on either side of its cheek. The warriors are
muscular with the same skin tone. They have white hair, but their
facial features are covered with some kind of organic mask. The door
opens. Sumner steps forward.]
SUMNER
I'm Colonel Marshall Sum--
[The Wraith backhands Sumner, knocking him half-across the room. It's
eyes light on Toran. A warrior approaches him.]
TORAN
No, please...
[The Wraith warrior grabs Toran by the throat, lifts him up and starts
to leave.]
TEYLA
(pleading)
Take me in his place!
[Sumner crawls forward and stumbles to his feet.]
SUMNER
No, take me. We're the ones you're after, right? I'm their leader.
[The Wraith looks at Sumner dismissively and leaves with Toran and the
warriors. The doors close behind them.]
TEYLA
They have no need to explain themselves.
SUMNER
Yeah, I got that.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[A technician, Weir, and McKay study a monitor display that shows only
darkness.]
TECHNICIAN
We're receiving visual telemetry.
WEIR
I can't see anything.
MCKAY
No atmospheric readings at all.
[Sumner and Grodin are watching a different monitor of the same data
and spot a small round point of dim light before it quickly rotates
offscreen.]
SHEPPARD
Hey, what was that?
MCKAY
Rotate the camera.
[The technician complies. The camera shows rocks floating in space and
rings surrounding a planet. The Stargate floats in orbit above the
planet, the wormhole still active.]
MCKAY
(scoffing)
Well, there goes that MALP.
SHEPPARD
It's in space.
MCKAY
It's in high orbit around a planet on the far side of the galaxy.
WEIR
Are you sure this is the right address?
MCKAY
It's the only one we could get a lock on.
WEIR
(sighing)
Very well. Shut it down.
(to Sheppard)
I'm sorry.
[She leaves. McKay continues to study the monitor as the Stargate shuts
down.]
MCKAY
Come with me, Major.
[Sheppard follows McKay out of the room.]
INT--ATLANTIS JUMPER BAY
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay and Sheppard enter the ship. It lights up as they move inside.
Sheppard walks to the pilot seat and touches the console. It
immediately lights up.]
MCKAY
You think you can fly it?
SHEPPARD
What do you say we find out?
[He sits in the pilot's chair.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett is studying the Wraith forearm under heavy magnification. Weir
enters.]
WEIR
Doctor Beckett, what was it you wanted me to see?
[He turns to her and grins. She stops short at seeing the specimen he's
studying. He lifts it up.]
BECKETT
These cells have none of the normal human inhibiting proteins
whatsoever. That gives them an incredible ability to regenerate.
WEIR
What about the movement Major Sheppard saw?
BECKETT
As far as independent behavior, I'd say that anything he saw was
caused by a residual command language in the severed nerve endings.
WEIR
All right, anything else?
BECKETT
The being this arm belonged to...if I was a betting man, I'd say it
was old, very, very old.
WEIR
How old?
[He turns the hand over, showing a small puckered incision in the
middle of the palm of the hand, surrounded by small holes.]
BECKETT
As long as the cells are properly nourished, I don't see a life form
like this ever dying of natural aging the way we do...and they'd be
bloody hard to kill.
WEIR
I don't like the sound of that.
BECKETT
I don't blame you.
INT--ATLANTIS JUMPER BAY
[Weir and McKay enter the room. A constant thrum, like of some kind of
energy powered up makes a steady hum. There is no sign of Sheppard or
the ship he was in.]
WEIR
What is that noise?
MCKAY
(exasperated)
I...I don't... He was right here. Major!
[The ship rematerializes from an invisible cloak, hovering in front of
them. Sheppard waves.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
You said you wanted a tactical advantage?
WEIR
(smiling)
All right, so you can fly that thing. It doesn't mean you can pull
off a rescue.
SHEPPARD
(patiently)
Doctor...this is why you brought me here.
[She stares jaw agape and shakes her head.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The room is bustling with activity. Weir approaches McKay.]
WEIR
Ready?
MCKAY
(speaking rapidly)
I have no idea. This technology is so far beyond us, I mean, we
haven't a clue what we're dealing with. I mean, for all I know, we
could...
[He notices Weir's glare.]
MCKAY
Yeah. Ready.
INT--SHIP
[Ford walks past the group of marines sitting in the rear compartment.]
FORD
All right, boys, get ready to go.
[He takes the co-pilot seat next to Sheppard and grins excitedly.]
FORD
Gateship One ready to go.
SHEPPARD
"Gateship One"? A little puddle jumper like this?
FORD
It's a ship that goes through the 'gate--Gateship One.
SHEPPARD
Oh, no, no, no, that's all wrong.
FORD
Dr. McKay thought it was cool.
SHEPPARD
Oh, okay, well, it's official...You don't get to name anything,
ever.
(into radio)
Flight, this is...Puddle Jumper. We're go to launch.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(miffed)
This is Flight. I thought we were going with Gateship.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Negative, Flight.
MCKAY
Stand by. It's a ship that goes through the gate.
[He notices Weir's curious but impatient expression.]
MCKAY
Uh...fine.
(into radio)
Puddle Jumper, you are clear for launch.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Dial it up, Lieutenant.
[Ford starts to dial the jumper's DHD.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The Stargate activates. The ceiling retracts as the jumper lowers into
the Gate Room. Sheppard mans the controls and it flies through the
active wormhole. The Stargate deactivates.]
WEIR
(low, to herself)
Be safe.
EXT--SPACE
[The puddle jumper flies through the Space Gate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Wow. This is cool.
FORD
It looks like you've got the hang of it.
SHEPPARD
I tell you what, Lieutenant. I know a lot of fighter pilots who'd
kill to fly this thing. It's like it reads your mind.
[A display appears superimposed on the windshield in front of them,
displaying lots of data.]
FORD
(nervous)
Did you do that?
SHEPPARD
I was just...wondering where we go from here.
FORD
I'll take that as a yes. So how do we find them once we land?
SHEPPARD
Well, I've been thinking about that too.
[From beside Sheppard, a small hand held device pops out of the wall.
Sheppard pulls it out, looks at it, shrugs, and puts it in a pocket.]
SHEPPARD
Now I'm thinking about a nice turkey sandwich.
[They look around for several moments, but nothing happens.]
FORD
Worth a try.
EXT--WRAITH PLANET, NIGHT
[A large facility is set up in a forest on the planet.]
INT--WRAITH CELL
[The Wraith and warriors stalk towards the cell again. They enter, and
this time the Wraith stares down Sumner. It hisses and stalks away.
Sumner glances back at Bates, stone-faced, then, back erect, calmly
follows his prison guards. Teyla bites her lip with worry.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The cloaked jumper lands in the woods just outside the facility.
Sheppard exchanges looks with Ford. He gets up and heads to the back.]
FORD
(to others)
Lock and load.
EXT--FOREST CLEARING, DAWN
[The jumper de-cloaks as it lands, the team exiting and spreading out,
weapons at ready.]
SHEPPARD
All right, teams of two. Learn what you can and lay down your
defenses as you see fit. I want to be able to light this place up if
we have to.
(to Stackhouse)
Two clicks, you're clear to talk.
STACKHOUSE
Yes, sir.
SHEPPARD
(to everyone)
Do not engage the enemy.
(tapping Ford)
You're with me.
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
[Sumner is led to a large room. There is food set up on a table,
including the head of a mastadge. The skeletal remains of Toran sit on
a chair. Sumner recognizes him by his clothes. He warily looks around.
There is a darkened ceiling with several interlocking triangular
honeycombs. He starts at a noise and turns around. Behind his back a
Wraith Queen leaps down to the floor. She has similar features to the
male Wraith, but her hair is red. He feels her presence and turns to
face her, frightened.]
WRAITH QUEEN
You must feel hunger by now.
[She snarls at him.]
INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR
[A warrior stalks down a passage. Behind him, unnoticed, are Sheppard
and Ford, who move into the passageway when the route is clear.]
FORD
I thought getting in was going to be the hard part. That's the first
one we've seen.
[Ford sets some C-4 into the wall and primes it. Sheppard studies the
handheld device he took from the jumper.]
SHEPPARD
The moving dot should be him. Go over there.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, that's you.
FORD
So, we've got ourselves a life-signs detector.
SHEPPARD
We can name it later.
INT--WRAITH CELL
[Teyla hears a noise. She sees Sheppard and Ford approaching from a
side-corridor.]
TEYLA
Major?
SHEPPARD
Shh. Are you all right?
TEYLA
How did you find us?
HALLING
Is my son alive?
SHEPPARD
He's well and waiting for you.
[He looks at who is in the cell.]
SHEPPARD
Where's Colonel Sumner?
BATES
He was taken by the Wraith.
TEYLA
We don't know where.
SHEPPARD
Well, how about when?
TEYLA
Not long.
SHEPPARD
I knew something had to go wrong.
[He clicks his radio twice.]
STACKHOUSE
(over radio)
This is Stackhouse. Go ahead, sir.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
How about a diversion in a little bit?
EXT--WRAITH PLANET CLEARING
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
You're going to need to make some noise out there.
STACKHOUSE
(into radio)
Yes, sir.
[Stackhouse moves to the jumper.]
INT--WRAITH CELL AREA
SHEPPARD
(to Ford)
Rig up enough C-4 to blow a hole and get these people out of here on
my signal, all right? I can find the Colonel with this. There aren't
that many Wraith around. I should be able to do this. If I'm not
back in twenty minutes, blow the cells and get out.
FORD
You're the only one who can fly these people out of here.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, I'm going to fly us all out of here, including the Colonel.
FORD
I'm saying I should be the one to go, sir.
SHEPPARD
Twenty minutes...I'll find him.
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
WRAITH QUEEN
What do you call yourself?
SUMNER
(with bravado)
Colonel Marshall Sumner, United States Marine Corps.
WRAITH QUEEN
(amused)
So little fear. Is it valor...or ignorance?
SUMNER
We travel through the Stargate as peaceful explorers.
WRAITH QUEEN
You must eat, yet you resist your hunger. Why?
SUMNER
Why have you taken my people prisoner?
WRAITH QUEEN
You trespassed upon our feeding ground.
SUMNER
(puzzled)
Feeding ground?
WRAITH QUEEN
All living things must eat. In this, I am sure we are similar. You
feel hunger even now. I can sense it. Yet you resist. Why?
SUMNER
Why do you care?
WRAITH QUEEN
Hunger...is distasteful.
SUMNER
(looking nervously at Toran)
It looks to me like the food didn't agree with him.
WRAITH QUEEN
There, we are quite dissimilar, Colonel Sumner. We don't
require...our food to agree with us.
[She strokes one finger down the skeleton's cheek. Sumner stares in
shock.]
INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR
[Sheppard moves down the corridor, using the life signs detector to
guide him.]
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
WRAITH QUEEN
What do you call your world?
[Sumner does not answer. The queen approaches.]
WRAITH QUEEN
(hypnotic, echoing voice)
What do you call your world? What...do you call...your world?
[The echo repeats. Sumner struggles to resist.]
SUMNER
(strained)
Earth.
WRAITH QUEEN
It is not among our stars.
SUMNER
(with pained reluctance)
No.
WRAITH QUEEN
Tell me of Earth. How many more are there of your kind? Thousands?
Millions?
[Sumner closes his eyes, wincing and shaking to resist her.]
WRAITH QUEEN
(triumphant)
More.
[Sumner opens his eyes, looking defeated. The queen is exultant.]
WRAITH QUEEN
Our feeding ground has not been so rich in ten thousand years.
INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR
[Sheppard continues to move through the area.]
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
WRAITH QUEEN
Your will is strong. This one (gestures to Toran)
begged for its life.
SUMNER
Is that the kind of treatment I can expect for myself and my people?
WRAITH QUEEN
As I have said, all living things must eat.
SUMNER
(rebellious)
Then we're done talking.
WRAITH QUEEN
I think not. Kneel.
[She draws a finger down Sumner's face.]
WRAITH QUEEN
(insistent, in the hypnotic echo)
Kneel...
[Sumner, against his own will, falls to his knees.]
WRAITH QUEEN
I have not tasted such strength in so long.
[She rips his t-shirt with one stroke of her hand, baring his chest.]
SUMNER
Go to hell.
WRAITH QUEEN
Earth first.
[She shoves her hand onto his chest. He screams in agony.]
INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR
[Sheppard can hear Sumner's scream and moves towards the sound.]
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
WRAITH QUEEN
How many years must I take from you before you tell us what I wish
to know? Or shall I take them all?
[Sumner's face contorts in agony as he continues to yell. He begins to
age.]
INT--WRAITH CORRIDOR
[Sheppard wanders, looking lost for a moment before getting his
bearings.]
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
[The Wraith Queen's hand is flat on Sumner's chest, palm against his
heart. Sumner's head rocks as he continues to scream in pain. His face
looks sunken and aged.]
WRAITH QUEEN
Where is this new feeding ground?
SUMNER
(shaking his head, weak)
I won't.
[Sheppard crawls on his belly from a side corridor to a spot where he
can look into the room through a skylight window. He sees the Queen's
back to him, feeding on Sumner, who is facing towards the Major.
Sheppard shoots the Queen in the back, then kills one of the warrior
guards. The Wraith Queen hisses in rage, her fingernails digging into
Sumner's chest, drawing blood as she sucks more life from him. He ages
more as the bullet exit wounds heal on her own chest. Sheppard shoots
the other guard, then stares in curious horror at Sumner's almost
skeletal condition.]
[Sumner stares back at Sheppard, looking extraordinarily old. Sumner
makes a pleading sound in his throat and nods to Sheppard. Looking
grim, Sheppard raises his rifle. He shifts his aim from the Queen's
head to Sumner's chest and shoots him right through the Queen's hand.
Sumner falls dead.]
[The Queen stares at her injured hand in annoyance. A blue light
surrounds Sheppard, and he collapses, stunned into unconsciousness. A
Wraith stands to attention, pleased at his catch.]
WRAITH QUEEN
Bring him.
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
[Sheppard is pinned by his throat on the table's surface by one of the
Wraith warriors.]
SHEPPARD
(strained)
How's the hand feeling?
[Before his eyes the bullet hole in her hand heals. She flexes her
hand.]
WRAITH QUEEN
Much better.
SHEPPARD
I'm sorry to hear that.
[The Queen is distracted at spotting the life signs detector sticking
out of Sheppard's vest.]
WRAITH QUEEN
How did this come to you?
SHEPPARD
I don't remember.
[She snarls. Ford enters, shooting both her and the guard. Sheppard
rolls, keying his radio as he moves.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Light it up.
EXT--WRAITH FACILITY, DAWN
[Explosions rock the facility.]
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
[The Queen screams her outrage.]
INT--WRAITH CELL AREA
[Wraith run towards the cell.]
BATES
Cover!
[He shoves people towards the back of the cell as the door explodes.]
INT--WRAITH DINING ROOM
[The Queen continues to scream as Ford shoots more guards who arrive.
Sheppard stays down by the table. He picks up the downed Wraith's
weapon, which has a large pointed end, and rolls up and out to stab the
Queen through, using the weapon as a javelin.]
SHEPPARD
That has to kill you.
[He pulls out the weapon. The Queen collapses.]
SHEPPARD
How'd you find me?
FORD
Tread marks. Standard issue. Sir, let's go.
WRAITH QUEEN
You don't know what you have done. We are merely the caretakers for
those that sleep. When I die, the others will awaken.
(in deep growl)
All of them.
[She dies.]
FORD
What's she talking about? How many are left?
[Sheppard picks up the life signs detector. Several dots appear on the
display, with more every second. They look up. The honeycomb ceiling
lights up. Hundreds of Wraith appear to be awakening, one in each
chamber.]
FORD
Sir, we need to leave.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Base, we're on the go.
BATES
(into radio)
So are we. Colonel Sumner?
SHEPPARD
Negative.
[They run out.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Weir stares at the Stargate. McKay approaches.]
MCKAY
(excitedly)
Dr. Weir. We're getting reports in from all over the city. There's
some pretty interesting stuff. We've only been able to provide power
to certain sections, but even then, the things that are coming up
are just...
[He notices her somber expression and his voice trails off.]
WEIR
(pensive)
I should never have let them go.
MCKAY
For what it's worth, you made the right decision. Give them time.
[He leaves her alone.]
EXT--CLEARING, WRAITH PLANET, DAWN
STACKHOUSE
(into radio)
Major, the Jumper is secure for the moment, but we have a big
problem.
EXT--FOREST, WRAITH PLANET, DAWN
[Sheppard leads everyone escaping through the forest back to the
jumper.]
SHEPPARD
(to Ford)
Lieutenant, take our six. I'm going to take them back to the Jumper.
FORD
I'll be right behind you.
[Ford slows up and turns around. He fires into the stillness, catching
wisps of visions. Teyla suddenly appears behind him and disarms him,
flips the gun around and gives it back to him.]
TEYLA
(scolding)
There's nothing there.
FORD
(petulant)
I'm sure I saw something.
TEYLA
Only what the Wraith wish you to see! Firing your weapon will reveal
our position. Come on.
INT--CLEARING, WRAITH PLANET, DAWN
[The group has reached the clearing. Sheppard pauses as the Athosians
and Bates run past.]
SHEPPARD
(shouting)
Get in!
[He hears Wraith ships approaching. He raises his pistol, then changes
his mind and grabs one of the marines' rifles. That marine unholsters
his own sidearm. They all aim towards the sky.]
INT--FOREST, WRAITH PLANET, DAWN
[Ford and Teyla run towards the clearing. A Wraith ship approaches.
Teyla knocks Ford down, diving out of the way just as the beam goes by.
Sheppard stands before them, shooting down the ship as it flies
overhead. Debris falls around them. Ford smiles.]
FORD
Thank you, sir.
SHEPPARD
Let's try not to make a habit of this.
[He helps them up as they run back towards the jumper.]
EXT--CLEARING, WRAITH PLANET, DAWN
[Several Wraith ships fly overhead as the few stragglers run in.]
STACKHOUSE
We have incoming!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard immediately moves to the pilot's seat.]
SHEPPARD
Okay...now what am I thinking?
[The ship lifts off.]
SHEPPARD
Everybody okay back there?
TEYLA
We are well enough.
[Ford takes his seat.]
FORD
Hope that was the hard part.
[As they enter orbit, they see several of the small Wraith ships
flanking the Space Stargate.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, crap. I don't think we've gotten to the hard part yet.
EXT--SPACE
[The hive ships surround the Spacegate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Teyla approaches Sheppard.]
TEYLA
What can we do?
FORD
We're safe as long as they can't see us.
SHEPPARD
They don't have to. There's only one way for us to go. The minute we
activate the Stargate, they can start shooting blind and blow us
away on our approach.
FORD
Then how can we get through?
SHEPPARD
We have to draw them away from the gate and double back.
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper de-cloaks and flies away. Several dart ships break
formation and give chase.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Be prepared to dial the gate on my mark.
[Ford's hand hovers over the first chevron.]
EXT--SPACE
[One of the darts fires at the jumper.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Do you see anything like a weapons console over there?
EXT--SPACE
[A panel expands and a drone launches, destroying a Wraith dart. The
jumper continues to dodge fire from the other dart ships as it circles
back to the Stargate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
Try and go invisible again.
SHEPPARD
(wincing)
I tried. It must be damaged. Dial the gate.
[Ford starts to dial.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE AND CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate activates.]
GRODIN
Off-world activation!
[Weir runs out of her office.]
WEIR
Raise the shield.
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper continues to dodge Wraith blasts. The Stargate is active,
but two darts still guard it. Drones hit one of them as the jumper
flies past the Stargate without going through.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Be ready to punch in your code on the next pass.
[Ford fumbles for his G.D.O.]
FORD
What's the range on these things?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Do we have an identification code?
[McKay races to a laptop.]
MCKAY
Nothing yet.
EXT--SPACE
[Drones shoot out the remaining ship guarding the Stargate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(to Ford)
Enter your code!
(to everyone else)
Hang on.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
MCKAY
I'm reading Lieutenant Ford's IDC.
WEIR
Let them in.
[Grodin lowers the shield.]
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper loops for another pass, dodging fire.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Some errant blasts come through the Stargate. Expedition guards dive
out of the way.]
WEIR
Give them a few more seconds!
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper races towards the Spacegate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
FORD
(worried)
We're going too fast.
SHEPPARD
I know.
EXT--SPACE
[The jumper's drive pods suddenly retract and it coasts through the
Stargate, still at high speed. Three small Wraith dart ships follow.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The jumper comes to an abrupt halt just after it clears the Stargate.]
WEIR
Re-activate the shield!
[The shield stops the other ships from passing through. McKay breathes
a sigh of relief, and he and Grodin join Weir at the balcony. The
jumper floats back up into the bay.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Atlantis. Please remain seated till
the Puddle Jumper's come to a full and complete stop.
[Teyla and Halling exchange relieved smiles.]
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, NIGHT
[Athosians and expedition members mingle together. Several tables have
food. All seem happy. Ford follows Sheppard to a quieter part of the
balcony.]
FORD
I guess this is home now.
SHEPPARD
I guess so.
FORD
(gesturing to one of the buildings)
I'm thinking of a little place with an ocean view. Out of the way.
[Weir comes up behind them, carrying three mugs.]
WEIR
Major, Lieutenant, I thought the occasion merited opening
this...compliments of General O'Neill.
SHEPPARD
(raising a toast)
Cheers.
[They all take a drink. Sheppard sets down his mug afterwards, looking
pensive.]
WEIR
You did good, John.
SHEPPARD
I don't know about that.
WEIR
Hey, there was no way you could have saved Colonel Sumner.
SHEPPARD
I have to live with it.
[Weir swallows and nods.]
SHEPPARD
I'm beginning to think you were right. I have made things much
worse. I haven't made us many more friends out there.
WEIR
No? Look around you.
[They look back at the crowd. Halling can be seen grinning with Jinto
and exchanging the forehead touch of affection common to Athosians.
They look out at the ocean. Teyla has been close enough to overhear and
turns to Sheppard.]
TEYLA
I agree, Major Sheppard.
[She approaches and puts her hands on his shoulders, leaning forward
with a head bow. Hesitantly, Sheppard bows as well, repeating the
forehead touch. They lean back.]
TEYLA
You have earned both my friendship and that of my people. With our
help, you will make many more friends.
[She grins at Weir and walks away. From amongst the crowd, Beckett and
McKay watch her go, McKay gnawing on a chicken wing.]
BECKETT
(sighing)
How come I never make friends like that?
MCKAY
You need to get out more.
BECKETT
We're in another galaxy. How much more out can you get?
MCKAY
(distracted by his chicken)
Is there lemon in this?
[He walks back towards the buffet table. Weir and Sheppard remain at
the outer balcony]
WEIR
One more thing, Major, something I'd like you to sleep on. I have a
few thoughts on it myself.
SHEPPARD
Thoughts about what?
WEIR
Who the members of your team might be.
SHEPPARD
My team?
WEIR
Well, you are the ranking military officer now, or do you need to be
reminded of that? We need to get back out there, do what we came to
do.
SHEPPARD
You realize that could get us into all sorts of...trouble, right?
[They exchange wry grins and lean on the banister.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
FADE OUT
