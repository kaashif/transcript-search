   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM

   [Woolsey briefs Sheppard's team.]

     WOOLSEY
     As you may have already heard, we have received an invitation...or
     more precisely, your team has received an invitation to represent
     Atlantis at a meeting of leaders from various human populations
     throughout the Pegasus Galaxy.

     SHEPPARD
     What's this? A Pegasus version of the United Nations?

     WOOLSEY
     Mmm, nothing quite so formal. At the moment, it's more of a loose
     coalition.

     MCKAY
     Is there any advanced technology in this "coalition"?

     WOOLSEY
     No. But the IOA believes it could be an important first step toward
     interplanetary government. A..."federation", if you will.

     MCKAY

     (drily)
     The Federation had ships. Look, what do we hope to gain from this? I
     mean, the only reason these people even know about each other is
     because they happened to inherit the 'gate system from the Ancients.

     TEYLA
     Just because they lack advancement does not mean they cannot benefit
     from cooperation.

     RONON
     She's right. It's about time people in this galaxy got together and
     stood up for themselves.

     MCKAY

     (skeptical)
     Against the Wraith?

     RONON
     Why not?

     WOOLSEY
     The Wraith are at war with each other, which is why the people
     trying to form this coalition feel the time is right. And they want
     us to be part of it.

   WORMHOLE EFFECT

   EXT--VILLAGE, DAY

   INT--STONE CHAMBER

   [Sheppard's team are led into a sparsely furnished stone chamber lit by
   candles with no windows. McKay groans at the accommodations.]

     WOMAN
     The council liaison will be with you in a moment.

   [She shuts the heavy metal door behind her as she leaves. Sheppard sits
   on the wooden table and sniffs a fruit.]

     MCKAY

     (sarcastic)
     Wow. They're really, uh, rolling out the red carpet for us, huh?

     TEYLA
     I'm sure they're just trying to keep the details of this meeting
     secret.

   [Smokey gas starts to hiss into the room from a vent.]

     MCKAY
     Uh, guys? Not good!

   [McKay and Teyla try to cover their mouths with their clothing.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ronon!

   [Ronon blasts at the door to no effect. The room quickly fills with the
   gas. McKay, closest to the fumes, is the first to fall. Teyla soon
   after. Ronon and Sheppard try and pull the door open, but both succumb
   and collapse.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--JAIL CELL

   [Sheppard's team are lying on the floor. They awaken, groaning, to find
   themselves in a different room. The walls are stone and metal bars
   block the door.]

     TEYLA
     Where are we?

     RONON
     We're not in the same room. We've been moved.

     MCKAY
     What the hell happened?

     SHEPPARD
     That's a good question.

   [Two men approach the barred door.]

     TEYLA

     (to men)
     What is the meaning of this?

     MYRUS
     It will all be explained shortly. The council wishes to speak to
     Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

   [Myrus looks around at the team, trying to distinguish Sheppard from
   the group. Sheppard bites his lip.]

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

   [Sheppard is brought into a large curtained room. He's forced to step
   onto a wide wooden pedestal. Two men and a woman sit at a long table at
   the end of the room, facing the pedestal.]

     KELORE
     I am Kelore of Latira. This is Shiana of the tribes of Santhal and
     Dimas of the free peoples of Riva. We speak on behalf of the
     Coalition.

     SHEPPARD
     You know, if you wanted to keep this location secret, you could have
     just blindfolded me. I wouldn't have...peeked. I swear.

     KELORE
     Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, you stand before this council as a
     representative of the Atlantis Expedition.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay.

     KELORE
     And as such, it falls to you to answer the charges.

     SHEPPARD

     (nonplussed)
     Excuse me?

     KELORE
     You will be given ample opportunity to present your defense. And
     when all evidence is heard, we will decide the outcome.

     SHEPPARD
     What the hell are you talking about? What is this?

     KELORE
     The Atlantis Expedition has been accused of crimes against the
     peoples of this galaxy. This is your trial.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Woolsey jogs down the steps to greet Lorne's team as they return
   through the Stargate.]

     WOOLSEY
     Major, what happened?

     LORNE
     We're still trying to figure that out, sir. One thing's for sure,
     they're not in the village any more.

     WOOLSEY
     They wouldn't have gone anywhere else without notifying us first.

     LORNE
     Not voluntarily, no.

     WOOLSEY
     Take as many men as you need. Search the entire area. And keep
     questioning the villagers. Somebody there knows something.

   [Lorne's team leaves Woolsey looking angry and frustrated.]

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     SHEPPARD
     This was supposed to be a meet-and-greet. Just cocktails, hors
     d'oeuvres, maybe a little dancing...

     DIMAS
     Subterfuge was necessary. You possess technology and military power
     beyond the scope of most of the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.

     KELORE
     Which is why you have been brought to a secure council. Only the
     members of this council and key personnel know the 'gate address.

     SHIANA
     So don't waste your time entertaining any hopes of rescue.

     SHEPPARD

     (exasperated)
     What is exactly that you think we did?!

     DIMAS
     According to our calculations, the Atlantis Expedition is
     responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of over two
     million people in this galaxy.

     SHEPPARD
     You've got to be kidding me!

     KELORE
     Tell us about your first encounter with the Wraith.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh. Okay. I see where this is going.

   [Sheppard folds his arms across his chest defensively.]

     KELORE
     When you arrived here, the Wraith were in hibernation, were they
     not?

     SHEPPARD
     Not all of them.

     DIMAS
     What do you mean?

     SHEPPARD
     I mean, they attacked us.

   EXT--ATHOS, NIGHT

   [As Ford and others look on, darts fly through the Stargate.]

   EXT--ATHOS FOREST, NIGHT

   [Teyla and Sheppard walk through the forest. Teyla suddenly pauses,
   listening for the darts.]

     SHEPPARD
     What is it?

     TEYLA
     The Wraith!

   [They run to the camp.]

   EXT--ATHOS SETTLEMENT, NIGHT

   [Darts fly over the camp.]

     SUMNER
     Take that thing down!

   [A service member fires a bazooka and shoots down the dart.]

     SUMNER
     That's one.

   [He and the man next to him are swept up in a culling beam.]

   EXT--ATHOS CLEARING, NIGHT

   [Teyla and Sheppard run flat out. A culling beam chases behind them.]

     TEYLA
     Get down!

   [Sheppard dives to the forest floor. Teyla is taken by the beam.
   Sheppard turns to face the danger, and sees nothing nearby.]

     SHEPPARD
     Teyla?

   END EXCERPTS

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     KELORE
     That was a scouting party. Not a culling.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I didn't know that. All I know is they took our people.

     DIMAS
     And you went after them?

     SHEPPARD
     That's right.

     DIMAS
     You should have left them to their fate.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, I'm sure that's what you would've done, but that's not how we
     operate.

     DIMAS
     What happened?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we went in, we rescued as many people as we could, then...we
     got out.

     KELORE
     But not before encountering a queen.

     SHEPPARD

     (reluctantly)
     No.

   EXCERPT FROM 1.02 "THE RISING PART 2"

   INT--HIVE CHAMBER

   [Sheppard is held down by the throat. The queen picks up the Ancient
   device in his pocket.]

     QUEEN
     How did this come to you?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't remember.

   [The queen hisses and moves to feed. Ford appears and shoots the guard
   holding Sheppard down. The queen looks startled as Sheppard rolls out
   of the way.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Light it up!

   EXT--FOREST, NIGHT

   [Explosions rock the hive ship.]

   INT--HIVE CHAMBER

   [Sheppard impales the queen with the Wraith guard's large pointed
   device.]

     SHEPPARD

     (hoarsely)
     That has to kill you.

   [Sheppard pulls the weapon out. The queen falls.]

     FORD
     Sir, let's go.

     QUEEN

     (rasping)
     You don't know what you have done. We are merely the caretakers for
     those that sleep. When I die, the others will awaken...all of them.

   [The queen dies. Sheppard drops the weapon and picks up his Ancient
   life signs detector.]

     FORD
     What's she talking about? How many are left?

   [Sheppard checks the device. More and more life signs appear. Ford and
   Sheppard look up. Chambers across the ceiling light up, each one
   holding a Wraith.]

   END EXCERPTS

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     SHIANA
     So you admit it. You woke the Wraith.

     SHEPPARD

     (shrugging)
     Look, sooner or later, they were going to wake up on their own
     anyway.

     KELORE
     But not for generations.

     DIMAS
     You see, Colonel, most of the human populations of this galaxy have
     not yet fully recovered from the last round of cullings. As a result
     of this early awakening, several worlds have been driven to the
     point of extinction, their survivors scattered, their civilizations
     lost forever.

     SHEPPARD
     We're out there fighting the Wraith day after day, putting our asses
     on the line!

     KELORE
     But the fact remains many who have been killed would be alive today
     if you had never come here. Isn't that true?

     SHEPPARD
     That's it. I'm not playing this game anymore.

   [He spins to leave. Two guards step forward, blocking his path.]

     DIMAS
     This is just the first of many charges. If you refuse to
     participate, it will be taken as an admission of guilt on all
     counts. And we will have no choice but to proceed to sentencing.

     SHEPPARD
     What are you going to do? Put everybody in Atlantis in jail?

     DIMAS
     Obviously, that's not possible.

     SHEPPARD

     (triumphant)
     Hmph.

     DIMAS
     However, we can refuse cooperation. That means no more trade, no
     more relations of any kind. Atlantis will be completely isolated.

     SHEPPARD

     (caustically)
     No relations with the likes of you? Hm. I think we can handle that.

     KELORE
     The Coalition grows in strength and influence every day. Soon
     enough, all of your current trading partners will have no choice but
     to join, and therefore, to abide by the ruling of this council.

     SHIANA
     As for you and your team, an example must be made. Justice demands
     it.

     SHEPPARD
     Justice? Is that what you're calling this?!

     DIMAS
     A suitable uninhabited planet has been chosen. If you're found
     guilty, you'll be sent there without any hope of return for the rest
     of your natural lives.

   INT--JAIL CELL

   [Sheppard has been brought back to his teammates.]

     SHEPPARD
     Apparently, the, uh, planet they picked for us has just enough food
     for us to survive, so, technically, uh, it's not an execution.

     MCKAY
     Great.

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, and, uh, they took the DHD, so whoever comes through the
     'gate--they're not coming back.

     RONON
     The Daedalus can find us.

     MCKAY
     If they had the address, but-but, I mean, short of that, they'd need
     to search every solar system in the galaxy for a habitable planet,
     which would take all of like, what, like a million years?

     SHEPPARD
     Right. Let's not panic. I've been to the chamber a couple times now,
     and...I'm beginning to get a sense of the layout.

     TEYLA
     The architecture is definitely different from that of the village.

     SHEPPARD
     No, we're on another planet. Judging by the fact there's no natural
     light or windows, I'm guessing an underground bunker.

     RONON
     The guards?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, half a dozen or so. We're going to have to see if they change
     in shifts.

     MCKAY
     I don't suppose there's any chance you could just convince them that
     we're not guilty. 'Cause we're not, right?

   [Everyone looks at him doubtfully.]

     MCKAY
     Aw, come on. There is no way the Pegasus Galaxy would be better off
     if we'd never come here.

     TEYLA
     No. But since your arrival, there have been setbacks. Lives have
     been lost. But there is hope now where once there was none.

     SHEPPARD
     Look, as much as I'd like to tell these guys where to put their
     little trial? We're just gonna have to play along for a while until
     we figure out how to get out of here.

   INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM

   [Lorne's team escort Myrus through the Stargate. A stern looking
   Woolsey stands waiting to greet them.]

     LORNE
     Mr. Woolsey, this is Myrus. He claims to be a representative for the
     new Coalition of Planets.

     WOOLSEY
     Does he?

     MYRUS

     (hesitantly)
     Are you the leader of Atlantis?

     WOOLSEY
     That's right.

     MYRUS
     Then we need to speak.

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

   [Sheppard is back before the council.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, what's next on the agenda? Did we, uh, step on the rose bushes
     on our last trip to Vedeena?

     DIMAS
     Perhaps you've heard of a plague that's recently swept through
     several worlds--a sickness that arrives suddenly, runs its course in
     a matter of days, and typically kills one out of every three men,
     women, and children wherever it strikes...?

     SHIANA
     There are those who believe it is not a sickness at all, but a
     deliberate poisoning. The work of one individual.

     SHEPPARD
     I know who you're talking about. His name is Michael.

     KELORE
     It is said that he is neither human nor Wraith, but some kind of
     half-breed. Can you explain to us how such a thing is possible?

   [Sheppard takes a deep breath.]

     SHEPPARD
     One of our people was conducting research. They were trying to come
     up with a way to solve the Wraith problem once and for all.

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     KELORE
     You found a way to convert Wraith into humans?

     SHEPPARD
     Don't ask me the medical questions. I'm not a doctor.

     DIMAS
     And this Michael was one of your test subjects?

     SHEPPARD
     As a matter of fact, he was the first.

   EXCERPT FROM 2.18 "MICHAEL"

   INT--MICHAEL'S ROOM

   [Beckett checks Michael's vital signs as Sheppard and Weir enter.]

     BECKETT
     Blood pressure's fine. Pulse normal. You're bouncing back quite
     nicely.

     MICHAEL
     Bouncing back from what?

     WEIR
     Hello, Michael. Do you remember me?

     MICHAEL

     (bemused)
     No.

     WEIR
     I'm Doctor Elizabeth Weir. This is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD
     You serve under my command.

     WEIR
     Your name is Lieutenant Michael Kenmore. You're in a private room
     off the infirmary here in Atlantis. Is that familiar to you?

     MICHAEL
     Atlantis...Yeah, I think.

   INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY

     SHEPPARD

     (voiceover)
     We tried to convince him he was one of us, but he knew something was
     wrong. And then...he found proof.

   [Michael places dvds into his laptop computer. On the monitor, Beckett
   works with Michael writhing on the bed.]

   [Michael replaces the dvd with the Day Seven footage. Michael struggles
   against restraints.]

     MICHAEL

     (on video)
     Release me!

   [Michael changes it out for the Day One footage. On it, Sheppard and
   Ronon hold a writhing Michael down on the bed. Their bodies block a
   clear look at Michael.]

     MICHAEL

     (on video)
     You will die for this! Argh! Others will come for me. They will
     destroy you!

     SHEPPARD

     (on video)
     Blah Blah Blah.

     RONON

     (on video)
     They gotta find us first.

     SHEPPARD
     You're gonna need a name. How does Mike sound?

   to Beckett.]

     SHEPPARD
     After that, he escaped. He went back and forth between Wraith and
     human a couple more times until...finally he settled somewhere in
     between.

     SHIANA
     So once again, you admit your guilt. You unleashed this...thing on
     the galaxy.

     SHEPPARD
     We didn't just let him out the front door and forget about him.
     We've been chasing him ever since. Couple months ago, we managed to
     catch up with him.

   [Woolsey slams his hand down on the table. Myrus and Lorne sit at the

     WOOLSEY
     This is outrageous! You're telling me that one of first official
     acts of your new government was to assault and kidnap my people?

     MYRUS
     They weren't assaulted. They were arrested.

     LORNE
     Aw, you've got to be kidding me.

     MYRUS
     Believe me, not all of us agreed with this decision, but it wasn't
     taken entirely without reason.

     LORNE

     (angrily)
     We've been trying to help you people!

     MYRUS
     What you've been doing is making unilateral decisions that affect
     the lives of millions without consultation...and without
     accountability! This is no longer acceptable.

     WOOLSEY

     (sternly)
     I'm not going to get drawn into a debate here. I only need to know
     one thing--where are my people being held?

     MYRUS
     Of course, I can't tell you that.

     WOOLSEY
     Fair trials don't take place in secret locations.

     MYRUS
     Nevertheless...

     WOOLSEY
     I think Mister Myrus needs a little time to reconsider his position
     here. Escort him to a cell.

   [Lorne stands.]

     LORNE
     My pleasure.

     MYRUS
     You're making a mistake.

     WOOLSEY
     Am I?

     MYRUS
     When I was chosen to deliver this message, I knew there was a chance
     I wouldn't be coming back. But if you detain me, you will only be
     confirming what many already suspect--that you're a rogue element in
     this galaxy, operating without restraint or due process!

   [Woolsey shifts his jaw. He looks at Lorne.]

     WOOLSEY
     Lock him up.

     LORNE
     Let's go.

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     SHEPPARD
     All right. I'm not saying we haven't made some mistakes, but that's
     'cause we're the only ones out there fighting! Nobody else is out
     there taking on the Wraith.

     KELORE
     But isn't that your own fault as well?

     SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

     KELORE
     The Genii had a plan to combat the Wraith, but they were thwarted
     when you betrayed them.

     SHEPPARD

     (scornfully)
     Oh, is that what they told you? Because that's not what I remember!

   EXCERPT FROM 1.08 "UNDERGROUND"

     He did not survive.

     SORA

     (shocked)
     No. What happened?

     COWEN

     I think we should find out.

     COWEN

     She killed Tyrus.

     TEYLA
     No.

     COWEN

     By leaving him to die, you may just as well have killed him
     yourself.
     (he displays the Wraith data)
     We will keep this intelligence information, and your ship, and
     whatever quantities of C-4 you have in your possession.

     TEYLA

     That is all you ever intended...to use us.

     COWEN
     Your weapons.

     SHEPPARD
     No. I don't think so.

     TEYLA

     (to Sora)
     This is what your father died for? In the name of people who would
     lie and steal from those they would call friends?

     SHEPPARD

     Well, I lied too.

     So, you betrayed each other.

     SHEPPARD
     We came prepared. They made the first move. Look, the Genii plan was
     never gonna work anyways. They had bombs they couldn't finish
     without our help. They had no methods of delivery. If you want a
     military victory against the Wraith, we're your only chance.

     Yes, sir.

     WOOLSEY
     And?

     LORNE
     Nobody knows anything. At least, that's what they're saying.

     WOOLSEY
     You don't believe them?

     LORNE
     Well, frankly, right now, I don't know what to believe, sir. I mean,
     these people are supposed to be our friends. But, if we can't walk
     into an ordinary village without worrying about an ambush, what's
     the point?

     WOOLSEY
     We're not there yet. I refuse to believe that the whole galaxy has
     turned against us.

     LORNE
     Well, it might as well. Because right now, we have nothing.

     WOOLSEY
     Maybe not...Come with me.

     So you claim to have had military success against the Wraith?

     SHEPPARD
     We've done our share of damage, even managed to take a few hive
     ships out here and there.

     SHIANA

     (scornfully)
     Really? And how did you manage to accomplish this remarkable feat?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I can tell you one thing--it's never easy. But one good trick,
     is to get them to shoot at each other.

     SHEPPARD
     Let's see, what else did I leave out? There's been so many over the
     years, you know, it's hard to keep track...

     SHIANA
     Enough! You spin a colorful tale, Colonel. That much is obvious. Yet
     for all these fantastic claims, we have no evidence but your word.

     SHEPPARD
     This trial is evidence! None of this would be happening, your
     precious little coalition wouldn't even exist, if we hadn't have
     pushed the Wraith so far back that you got an opportunity you
     haven't had in ten thousand years!

     KELORE
     Your responsibility in this has already been determined. You woke
     the Wraith early, before the population of this galaxy had
     sufficient time to recover, which eventually led to the Wraith going
     to war with each other over feeding grounds. That war is what has
     given us this opportunity, not some imagined victory on your part.

   [Sheppard grimaces. The door swings open and Myrus quickly enters and
   walks to the council's table, whispering to Kelore.]

     KELORE
     We will take a recess. Please take the prisoner back to his cell.

   [Guards lead Sheppard away.]

   revealing Woolsey in their midst.]

     SHEPPARD

     (surprised)
     Woolsey, what the hell are you doing here?

     WOOLSEY
     I've made an arrangement with your captors. I'm taking over your
     defense.

     SHEPPARD
     Don't suppose you managed to bring along a subspace locator beacon,
     did you?

     WOOLSEY
     That's Wraith technology. It's not like we have one just lying
     around. I even tried to contact Todd to see if we could borrow one,
     but he never responded.

     MCKAY
     Well, what about the DHD on the planet where we were ambushed? I
     mean, you could pull the most recent addresses that were dialed from
     that.

     WOOLSEY
     Already done. There were over fifty addresses in the buffer. I
     almost cleaned out the entire city sending people to investigate all
     of them, but...they turned up nothing.

     TEYLA

     (realizing)
     They took us through more than one 'gate.

     WOOLSEY
     So it would seem. This was obviously very well thought out.

   [Sheppard smiles grimly and nods.]

     MCKAY
     All right, well they had a very clever plan, but we're-we're smarter
     and better armed. There's got to be a way around this.

     WOOLSEY
     They took advantage of one significant weakness--we trusted them.

   [Sheppard rubs his face in his hands. Woolsey walks over to an empty
   bench and dusts off a space for himself.]

     WOOLSEY
     Look, I came here because I have a plan to get you out of here.

     MCKAY
     Well, what is it?

     WOOLSEY

     (as if obvious)
     Win the trial.

   [The team exchange looks and dubious sighs.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, we were just playing along to buy us enough time to figure out
     a way out of here.

     WOOLSEY
     And how's that coming along?

     SHEPPARD

     (sheepishly)
     Well...we're...we're working on it.

     WOOLSEY
     I was Harvard Law Review. I was chief counsel of the U.S. Army Corps
     of Engineers. Prior to that, I was an appellate advocate for
     Hartshorne & Slaughter, one of the most prestigious litigation
     boutiques in all New York City.

   [He turns confidently to Ronon, who looks unimpressed.]

     WOOLSEY
     Eh. Believe me, I can handle three tribal elders with a stack of
     papyrus.

     Some time ago, a number of human worlds were attacked and destroyed
     from space. Not by the Wraith, but by someone else.

     DIMAS
     Little is known of this mysterious race except that they possess
     incredibly advanced technology, and are rumored to be allies of
     Atlantis.

     WOOLSEY
     I think I know who you're referring to, and believe me...they are
     not our allies. They're called Replicators. They were created by the
     Ancients.

   INT--ANCIENT LAB AND ZPM CHAMBER

   [Weir and Niam, still holding hands, are now in a lab filled with
   Ancient scientists. Niam starts to lead her through it.]

     NIAM
     The "Ancients" as you call them, were desperate in their search for
     a better way to fight the Wraith. Though greatly outnumbered, they
     relied on their technological superiority to give them a needed
     advantage. Instead of building bigger, more powerful weapons, they
     chose to build smaller ones.

   [As Niam speaks, Weir notices one scientist's work displayed on a large
   monitor. She recognizes the microscopic machines Niam describes.]

     WEIR
     Nanites.

   INT--NIAM'S MIND

   [The image of the Ancient lab disappears. Weir and Niam are now mostly
   in darkness, only a light from above shines down on them. It is the
   limbo of Niam's mind-link.]

     NIAM
     In these tiny killing machines, the Ancients imbued an aggression
     that surpassed even that of their enemy. The technology allowed for
     organic assimilation and self-replication to increase their
     effectiveness. And replicate they did.

   INT--ANCIENT CONFERENCE ROOM

   [The scene morphs again into a conference room, where Weir and Niam see
   several Ancients staring at the figure of Oberoth.]

     NIAM
     They grew in numbers, evolving at a rate that took the Ancients by
     surprise. The molecular machines began interlocking, assembling
     themselves to form even more complex organisms, eventually evolving
     into the most effective and efficient form they knew of. This is how
     we were born. When the Ancients concluded that we would never become
     the weapon they desired to create, they decided to end it.

   EXT--ASURAS, DAY

   [Niam and Weir stand on a desolate landscape. All around them, several

   troubled.]

     There's one thing I don't understand, Mr. Woolsey. If, as you

     The Holy Grail. I mean, it's their whole reason for being. It's a

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, but they don't attack the Wraith. They've been sitting on

     (incredulous)
     One of your people died and you consider this a grave sacrifice?

     WOOLSEY
     As a matter of fact, I do.

     SHIANA

     (upset)
     Then imagine how we feel--those of us who have witnessed the deaths
     of thousands!

     WOOLSEY
     We cannot be held responsible for the actions of the Replicators.

     DIMAS
     Colonel Sheppard made the same argument in respect to the Wraith.
     And in that case, I might be inclined to agree with him. But by your
     own admission, these Replicators are machines. So if I were to set a
     detonator, can I then later deny responsibility for the actions of
     the bomb?

     WOOLSEY
     By that logic, you might just as well blame the Ancients. They
     created them.

     DIMAS
     The Ancients, as you call them, are not here to answer for their
     actions. You are.

     WOOLSEY
     We know for certain of six human worlds that were destroyed by the
     Replicators. But we also know of at least a dozen hive ships that
     were destroyed--hive ships that would almost certainly have culled
     within a year. One could make the argument that on balance, more
     lives were saved than were lost.

     SHIANA

     (seething)
     "On balance?" Is that what we are to you? Figures on a ledger?
     Pieces that can be moved about in a game of strategy? Some to
     be...saved while others are sacrificed?

     I'm sorry. I certainly didn't mean to diminish--

     SHIANA

     Real people are being killed, Mr. Woolsey! Real villages destroyed.
     My village. My people. My husband and children murdered before my

     You're from one of the planets destroyed by the Replicators.

     SHIANA

     I barely escaped with my life, but...not before I saw everything I
     hold dear get wiped out by...a beam of light from the sky. And I
     will not rest until someone is made to pay for it.

     MCKAY

     (drily)
     Well, I guess we can rule out getting her vote.

     WOOLSEY
     It's clearly inappropriate for someone that biased to be on the
     council.

     SHEPPARD

     (shrugging)
     So they stacked the deck against us.

     WOOLSEY
     I'm not sure. Dimas seems to be a reasonable man. I think he might
     even be persuaded to vote our way. Kelore is a little harder to
     read.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, he seemed pretty hostile to me.

     WOOLSEY

     (shrewdly)
     Didn't you say he was from Latira?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, that's right.

     WOOLSEY
     One of our last intelligence reports suggests a growing relationship
     between Latira...and the Genii.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, he did try and convince me that they should be the ones
     leading the fight against the Wraith.

     TEYLA
     You think the Genii are behind this?

   [Woolsey stands and paces.]

     WOOLSEY
     It makes sense. Apart from Atlantis, they're clearly the biggest
     military power in the Coalition. If they played their cards right,
     they could wind up running the whole thing.

     SHEPPARD
     But only with us out of the picture.

     MCKAY
     So we were right all along; this whole thing is fixed!

     RONON
     I say we go to plan B. Wait for the guards to come in, I beat 'em
     up, take their guns, we shoot our way out of here.

     WOOLSEY
     And do we even know the way out?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we know we're at least two levels underground, and there's no
     more than a dozen or so guards at any one time.

     WOOLSEY
     What about on the surface? How many guards are up there? And which
     way is the 'gate and how far?

     SHEPPARD
     There's a few things we'll have to figure out along the way.

     WOOLSEY

     (sighing)
     It's too risky. We could wind up being shot before we even got out
     of the building.

     MCKAY
     What other choice do we have? I mean, we know we can't win this
     thing.

     WOOLSEY
     Not fairly, no.

   [The team looks at Woolsey, intrigued.]

     SHEPPARD

     Wait outside.

     You shouldn't have bothered. There's nothing I can do for you.

     WOOLSEY
     Well, maybe I'm just feeling generous tonight.

     You're backing the wrong horse. We know you're connected with the

     KELORE
     I don't know what you're talking about.

     WOOLSEY
     We also know they're looking to become the military muscle behind
     the Coalition. We think we'd make a better choice.

     KELORE
     You? Atlantis?

     WOOLSEY
     That's right.

     KELORE
     Well, I didn't realize you had those kinds of ambitions.

     WOOLSEY
     We've been content to keep to ourselves up until now. But if it's a
     choice between getting pushed out of the game and taking a more
     active part...well, that's no choice at all, is it? Of course, for
     appearances sake, we can't be too aggressive. So we'll need someone
     on the inside to help push our agenda... Someone to whom we'll be
     very, very grateful.

     And how do I know you haven't made this offer to the others?

     WOOLSEY
     I think we both know Dimas will only be swayed by reason, and
     Shiana's going to vote against us no matter what. That leaves you.

   [Kelore stares blandly back at Woolsey.]

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL ROOM

   [Later, Woolsey is brought before the full council by the guards. He
   takes his spot on the pedestal.]

     DIMAS
     Mr. Woolsey, are you ready to face the final charge?

     WOOLSEY
     I am.

     DIMAS
     The people of Atlantis stand accused of conspiring with the Wraith.

     WOOLSEY

     (bemused)
     Conspiring?

     KELORE
     We have reports that Atlantis has negotiated with the Wraith and
     performed military operations with them. It is said you have formed
     an alliance with one Wraith in particular.

     WOOLSEY
     Todd.

   [Dimas looks surprised at this admission and the label.]

     WOOLSEY
     That's...what we call him. This Wraith was imprisoned with Colonel
     Sheppard...by the Genii. The Wraith was allowed to feed on him. But,
     despite, this, Colonel Sheppard realized their best chance of escape
     was to work together.

   EXCERPT FROM 3.07 "COMMON GROUND"

   INT--GENII CELLS

   [The guards approach to get Sheppard and Todd the Wraith. They pull
   Sheppard to his feet and drag him out. Other guards pull the Wraith out
   and begin to attach the restraints. The feeding arm is sheathed.
   Sheppard pretends to collapse, catching the men off-guard, and slamming
   them both into the bars. The Wraith backhands one of his guards and
   uses the chain restraining him to choke the other, slamming the feeding
   arm lock against the wall until it releases. He starts feeding on the
   guard he chokes.]

   [Sheppard gains the upper hand on his two stunned guards. Meanwhile the
   other guard with the Wraith pulls his sidearm and shoots several rounds
   into the Wraith. The feeding Wraith screams in pain. Sheppard notices
   and grabs the knife on the belt of the guard he's fighting and throws
   it at the shooter. The Wraith continues to feed on the guard. Sheppard
   knocks his guard out and rummages at the guy's belt. The Wraith
   approaches and notices Sheppard now has a sidearm. Sheppard glances at
   the Wraith, then throws him keys. The Wraith frees his other hand.
   Sheppard grabs the other guard's sidearm and warily hands it over to
   the Wraith.]

     SHEPPARD
     Which way?

     TODD
     This way.

   END EXCERPT

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     DIMAS

     (incredulous)
     And you continue to have dealings with this Wraith?

     WOOLSEY
     We have...occasional contact.

     SHIANA

     (scoffing)
     You trust him?

     WOOLSEY
     Of course not. But he has proven to be useful at times.

   EXCERPTS FROM 4.11 "BE ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED"

     WOOLSEY

     (voiceover)
     He helped us hold off the Replicator fleet long enough for Doctor
     McKay to enact a plan to destroy them.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The battle continues. Both a Replicator ship and a Wraith ship are
   damaged.]

   INT--HIVE SHIP BRIDGE

     WRAITH TECHNICIAN
     Heavy damage in interior section.

     WRAITH
     Transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Daedalus comes between the two ships and destroys the Replicator
   ship damaging the Wraith ship.]

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     MARKS
     Our shields can't take much more of this, sir.

     ELLIS
     Hopefully, they won't have to. Get ready to transfer power from the
     beam weapons to the--

   [He's distracted from the view out the window.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Nanites start swarming from all the Replicator ships towards the
   surface of the planet.]

   INT--APOLLO BRIDGE

     MARKS
     What the hell...?

     ELLIS
     Son of a bitch. He actually did it.

   EXT--ASURAS, DAY

   [The nanites swarm to the Replicator blob, which is becoming denser and
   denser.]

   INT--ASURAS CORE ROOM

   [The room shakes violently.]

     MCKAY
     Um...we need to get out of here.

     RONON

     (to marines)
     All right, let's go. Come on!

   [Ronon leads McKay to the beam out point. They're beamed away.]

   INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

   [The team is beamed directly onto the bridge. McKay heads to Carter's
   station.]

     MCKAY
     As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go
     down.

     CARTER
     We should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point
     immediately. The planet's become unstable.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The ships leave the drifting Replicator ships and start heading into
   hyperspace. Below them, the planet begins to break apart. After they
   are gone, Asuras explodes, destroying the remaining Replicator ships.]

   END EXCERPTS

   INT--COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER

     WOOLSEY
     The fact is, we would never have defeated the Replicators without
     his help. I think it's safe to say they would have continued their
     policy of attacking human worlds. And by now, everyone in this
     galaxy...would be dead.

   [Kelore and Dimas appear moved by this information. Shiana purses her
   lips.]

     DIMAS
     Very well. As that was the final charge, we will recess to
     deliberate.

   [They start to rise.]

     WOOLSEY
     I'd like to make one final statement, if I may.

   [They remain seated and look to Dimas, who nods.]

     DIMAS
     Very well.

     WOOLSEY
     The Wraith are in disarray, but that won't last forever. Sooner or
     later, one faction will win out over the others. And when that
     happens, they will turn their attention to this Coalition with a
     ruthless vengeance, the likes of which you've never seen. If you
     don't want us there when that day comes fighting by your side, then
     by all means, vote us guilty.

   [Woolsey stares mostly at Kelore during this speech.]

     SHIANA
     I need no deliberation. I say we get this over with now.

   [Dimas looks to Kelore, who nods.]

     DIMAS
     Very well.

   [Woolsey sighs and steels himself.]

     SHIANA
     I vote guilty on all charges.

     DIMAS
     I vote not guilty on all charges. It falls to you, Kelore. Yours is
     the deciding vote.

   [Kelore stares at Woolsey.]

   INT--JAIL CELL

   [Guards lead Woolsey back to the cell, leaving it open behind him.
   Sheppard's team approach Woolsey in anticipation.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well? What's the word?

     WOOLSEY
     Not guilty.

     MCKAY

     (sighing in relief)
     Oh, thank god.

     WOOLSEY
     We're free to go.

   [Teyla and Ronon exchange relieved smiles. Sheppard reaches out and
   shakes Woolsey's hand.]

     SHEPPARD
     I never doubted you for a second.

   [Woolsey smiles.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT

   EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, NIGHT

   [Sheppard stands on the balcony. The door opens and Sheppard sees
   Woolsey approach. Woolsey is dressed in a dark suit and carries two
   glasses of liquor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ooh, nice suit!

     WOOLSEY
     Being back in the courtroom made me miss my old uniform.

     SHEPPARD
     You're kidding.

     WOOLSEY
     Not the job, just the uniform.

   [They both sip their drinks.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, that's nice.

     WOOLSEY
     Well, it seemed appropriate.

   [He takes a cigar out of his pocket and hands it to Sheppard. Sheppard
   looks surprised, but Woolsey takes one for himself as well.]

     SHEPPARD
     So, uh, you going to tell me how you managed to pull this one off?

   [Sheppard and Woolsey snip the ends off their cigars.]

     WOOLSEY
     Well, I'd say it was a combination of things: my legal skills, my
     eloquence, the indisputable logic of my arguments...and the bribe I
     offered Kelore.

     SHEPPARD
     Mmm.

   [Woolsey pulls out a lighter and lights Sheppard's and his own cigars.]

     WOOLSEY
     On top of that, I had to commit Atlantis to a much larger day-to-day
     participation in the politics of the Pegasus Galaxy. Can't wait to
     explain that in my report.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah. Well, what's the point in being out here if we're not going to
     try to make a difference, right?

     WOOLSEY
     Let's hope the IOA agrees with you.

     SHEPPARD
     We'll worry about that later. For now, congratulations.

   [They clink glasses in a toast.]

     WOOLSEY
     Thanks.

   [They both drink as they look out onto the lit cityscape.]

   FADE OUT
