EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
[Ford and his team are on a balcony, flanked by two groups of Wraith.]
FORD
Defense!
[Firefight between Ford's team and Wraith. Most on both sides are
killed or rendered unconscious. A Wraith soldier drone disarms Ford,
takes him by the throat and starts to feed on him. Meanwhile, an
injured Marine removes the pin from a grenade and drops it on the floor
behind the Wraith feeding on Ford, where it explodes. Ford and the
Wraith are blown off the balcony and fall into the ocean below.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[The Puddle Jumper, piloted by Colonel Sheppard, approaches the dart
bay entrance to a Wraith hive ship.]

CHUCK
Target has been neutralized.
WEIR
He did it.
MCKAY
(sadly)
Yeah. He did it.
CHUCK
Dr. Weir, I'm picking up another ship.
WEIR
Another hive ship?
CHUCK
Negative. I'm reading I.F.F.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.
WEIR
(with disbelief)
John?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
What other Sheppards do you know?
BECKETT
(smiling broadly and punching McKay on the shoulder)
Oh, thank God.
MCKAY
(incredulous)
No, it can't be. We saw the hive ship go up.
CALDWELL

I assure you, Dr. McKay, that Major Sheppard is alive and well.
WEIR
Who is this?
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE

assist you.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(with relief)
Oh, thank you.
WEIR
Well, we are very glad to hear it, Colonel. And I assume we have you
to thank for saving Major Sheppard.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
We were monitoring your transmissions as soon as we came out of
hyperspace, but we couldn't beam him in until he de-cloaked his
jumper.
SHEPPARD
Didn't take much convincing.
CALDWELL
Dr. McKay?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(jumping to his feet with surprise)
Present. Yes.
CALDWELL

I trust you'll know what to do with this.
[Two Marines carrying a metal box are beamed into the control room.]
MARINE #1
Your ZPM, Sir.
BECKETT
(shocked)
How did they do that?
MCKAY
(excitedly taking the box from the Marine)
The Daedalus is loaded with Asgard technology. The beaming
technology's the first part of it. They've got...
SHEPPARD

What say we.
WEIR
We still have Wraith all over the city.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
After we deal with this other hive ship, we'll assist you as soon as
we can. Caldwell out.
KLEINMAN
Sir, we have incoming enemy fighters bearing three-two-zero.

Colonel Caldwell? This is Novak in Engineering.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
CALDWELL
(over radio)
What is it?
NOVAK
Hermiod wanted to remind you that our shield strength will be
severely diminished without the Zero Point Module tied into our
power systems.
CALDWELL
(over radio)
I'm well aware of that, Doctor. Caldwell out.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Sheppard is standing at the window of the bridge, where Caldwell joins
him. The battle can be seen going on outside the ship.]
CALDWELL
Major, do you recommend any specific target on the hive ship?
SHEPPARD
One of the fighter bays, Sir.
CALDWELL
It would increase the chance of secondary explosions.
SHEPPARD
That was the thinking, Sir.
CALDWELL
I agree.
(to Kleinman)
Weapons, arm two Mark VIII tacticals. Our target is the hive ship's
main fighter bay.
KLEINMAN
Warheads armed. Target is locked, Sir.
CALDWELL
Fire.
EXT--DAEDALUS, SPACE BATTLE
[Missiles are launched but are intercepted by darts.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
(frustrated)
They didn't even get close.
CALDWELL
Pilot, alter heading to intercept. Go to max thrust.
COOPER
Max thrust.
CALDWELL
We'll just have to get closer.
SHEPPARD
(quizzically)
The Asgard gave you hyperdrives and shields. How come no offensive
weapons?
CALDWELL
They don't like providing other races with anything that could
potentially be used against them.
SHEPPARD
I thought they were allies.
CALDWELL
Without their beaming technology, you wouldn't be here, Major.
(to Kleinman)
Arm two more Mark VIIIs.
SHEPPARD
You're wasting ordnance, Colonel. Those missiles are being
intercepted miles from the hive ship.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Zelenka runs down the stairs into the control room, where he joins
McKay who is punching keys on the computer.]
MCKAY
I brought up the shield subroutine. When I give the word, all you
have to do is punch in...
ZELENKA
(impatiently)
Yes, I know what to do. Go.
[McKay takes the metal box containing the ZPM and joins Weir and two
Marines outside the control room.]
MCKAY
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? This is my security
escort?
WEIR
Well, we are spread a little bit thin right now.
MCKAY
(to Marines)
Okay, well, you need to know that if we come under fire, you'll have
to put your lives on the line to protect me.
WEIR
Rodney!
MCKAY
Okay, I mean, the ZPM. You need to protect the ZPM at all costs...
and me.
(to Weir)
Am I wrong?
[McKay and the Marines leave the gate room.]
CHUCK
Dr. Weir?
WEIR
Yes?
CHUCK
I've lost contact with some of our people.
WEIR
Who?
CHUCK
I can't get a hold of the teams led by Captain Radner, Teyla, or
Lieutenant Ford.
WEIR
Well, keep trying.
[Weir walks away as Chuck returns to his console, exchanging a
sympathetic glance with Zelenka and Beckett.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The monitor shows numerous Wraith ships bearing down on the Daedalus.]
SHEPPARD
Okay, now we're oh-for-two. How many of these things have you got?
CALDWELL
Only one needs to get through.
SHEPPARD
Is there any way we can deliver a warhead the same way you plucked
me out of the Jumper?
CALDWELL
The Asgard have already considered that, Major. There are fail-safes
built into the system to prevent their use as a weapons delivery
system.
SHEPPARD
You've got one of these Asgard on board. Can he override the
fail-safe?
CALDWELL
Why would he do that?
SHEPPARD
Well, his butt's on the line just as much as ours.
CALDWELL
(into radio)
Novak, I need you and Hermiod to figure out how to get a
site-to-site transport lock on a set of coordinates inside the hive
ship.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
NOVAK
(nervously)
No, no, no, no, no, no. Sir, uh, Hermiod isn't going to like that.
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Get it done, Doctor. That's an order.
[Hermiod looks quizzically at Novak, who appears anxious.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[McKay and two Marines are stealthily making their way through darkened
corridors. They stop when they see two Wraith soldier drones at a
control panel ahead.]
MCKAY
That's where we have to go.
[One of the Marines gives a series of hand signals to the other as the
three men take positions.]
MCKAY
What's that? I didn't get all that. What do I do? Look, I'm getting
good at the roll-y things. Maybe I can...
[The Marines move out, attracting the attention of the Wraith, who come
to investigate. They are ambushed and shot.]
MARINE
(to the other Marine)
Clear.
(to McKay as he tries to go with them)
No. You stay here.
MCKAY
What?
[Both Marines are shot by a Wraith soldier drone, who then aims his
weapon at McKay. McKay puts down the box containing the ZPM and looks
defiantly at the Wraith.]
MCKAY
So...this is how it's going to be, huh? Just me?
[Another Wraith enters and aims its weapon at McKay.]
MCKAY Okay, that's fine!
(drawing his sidearm)
You want some of this? Huh? Huh?
[McKay attempts to fire at the Wraith but the clip falls out of the
gun.]
MCKAY
(calling out frantically)
This is McKay! I'm in trouble down here!
[McKay ducks out of the way as automatic weapons fire is heard. Teyla
enters, having shot the two Wraith.]
TEYLA
Dr. McKay? Are you all right?
MCKAY
Teyla! We thought you were...
TEYLA
My radio is broken and I was separated from my group. I have been
trying to make my way back.
MCKAY
Well, thank God. I mean, you have no idea. I thought I was going
to...
TEYLA
I thought you were very brave.
MCKAY
(surprised)
Really? Oh.
[Teyla looks questioningly at the metal box.]
MCKAY
I have a ZPM.
TEYLA
Yes.
MCKAY
Because we need to get the shields up.
TEYLA
Lead the way.
MCKAY
Yeah, sure. Uh, after you.

NOVAK
I've set the timer for five seconds. Is that enough time for you?
HERMIOD
Five seconds should be more than ample.
NOVAK
Okay, look... I know you don't approve of using technology this way,
but you have to understand...
HERMIOD
(firmly)
I am ready.
NOVAK
(into radio)
Colonel, Hermiod is ready and standing by for warhead transport, but
I can tell you he is not happy about this.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL

Are we within transport range?
KLEINMAN
Yes, Sir.
CALDWELL
Transport warhead when ready.

Novak, I need you to prep another warhead for transport. We need to
take out those cruisers.
SHEPPARD
Sir, wait.
[Through the window behind Sheppard we see Wraith ships disappearing.]
KLEINMAN
Colonel, cruisers have broken off and entered hyperspace.
CALDWELL
After seeing what we just did to their remaining hive ships, I don't
blame them.
SHEPPARD
There's still a lot of darts out there.
CALDWELL
All right, let's clean this up.
KLEINMAN
Sir, the Wraith fighters are regrouping.
CALDWELL
All rail gun positions stand by for defensive fire.
SHEPPARD
We're not the target.
KLEINMAN
Major Sheppard is right, Sir. The formation is headed toward
Atlantis.
SHEPPARD

Elizabeth, you've got a problem.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

WEIR
Yeah, we see that, Major.
SHEPPARD

We're moving to intercept but I don't think we can get there in
time.
CHUCK
Not a chance. They're coming in too fast.
ZELENKA
(horrified)
Oh, my God. Their approach is ballistic.
WEIR
And what exactly does that mean?
ZELENKA
Their impact velocities will be in excess of 10,000 kilometers an
hour. No part of the city can withstand that.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
You better get the damn shield up.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

hug, uncomfortably.]
WEIR
Yes, you are. I truly thought you...
SHEPPARD
Yeah, yeah, I thought the same thing about you a minute ago. We've
got to stop that.
WEIR
I'd like that.
SHEPPARD
(changing the subject)
So where are we?
WEIR
Well, most of our sensors are still down, but we do know there are
at least a handful of Wraith still in the city.
SHEPPARD
I've still got some work to do.
WEIR
Before you do anything, Colonel Everett insists on speaking with
you. He's in the infirmary.
[Sheppard walks away.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard is standing my Everett's infirmary bed. Everett has aged
significantly as a result of having been fed on by the Wraith. His
hands are shaking and speech is difficult.]
SHEPPARD
We've neutralized the hive ships, activated the shields and we've
mustered as many people as we can, making sure there's no Wraith
hiding in the shadows.
EVERETT
Good work, Major.
SHEPPARD
Thank you, Sir.
EVERETT
They're shipping me out with the next batch of wounded. I want to
finish our conversation.
SHEPPARD
Yes, Sir.
EVERETT
I owe you an apology.
SHEPPARD
No, Sir, you don't.
EVERETT
I think I have a pretty good idea I would have done the same thing
as you did when you found Colonel Sumner. That's what I wanted to
tell you.
SHEPPARD
Well, none of that matters right now, Sir.
EVERETT
(fighting back tears)
I'm trying to say... I wish you had been there for me.
SHEPPARD
You're going to be fine, Sir. Once you get back to Earth...
EVERETT
I said what I had to say. Get back to work.
[Sheppard stands to attention and salutes Everett.]
SHEPPARD
Yes, Sir.
[Sheppard turns and leaves.]
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM.
[Sheppard enters gate room with Zelenka and they approach Weir, who is
having a conversation with two soldiers.]
ZELENKA
The preliminary count is forty casualties. Maybe more. I'm still
trying to line up life signs readings with actual people.
SHEPPARD
There are no Wraith life signs?
[Weir joins Sheppard and Zelenka and they walk across and up the stairs
to the control room as they talk.]
ZELENKA
The last one was trapped in one of the deeper parts of the city. He
died trying to damage the city with one of their grenades.
WEIR
Three of our men were injured. On the bright side, there was no
flooding.
SHEPPARD
Have we been able to locate Lieutenant Ford yet?
ZELENKA
I'm sorry. No. We've searched everywhere in the city. It's possible
he may have beamed up into one of the Wraith darts.
SHEPPARD
Let's not make that assumption.
ZELENKA
Major, I'm sorry. We've searched everywhere in the city.
SHEPPARD
Well, how about outside the city?
ZELENKA
I don't understand.
SHEPPARD
Well, expand the sensors. Maybe he's in the water.
ZELENKA
Even if that was the case, there's no chance...
SHEPPARD
(frustrated)
Look, I'm not asking you to swim out there. I'm asking you to press
a few damn buttons.
ZELENKA
Even if you're right, I don't see how...
[Zelenka presses some buttons and the monitor shows a blip outside the
city perimeter.]
ZELENKA
Oh my God.
WEIR

Colonel Caldwell, one of our men is in the ocean outside our shield,
most probably injured. Can you beam him to your ship, then down to
our infirmary?
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE

NOVAK

Atlantis? This is Dr. Novak on the Daedalus. You're going to need
some S.O.s in your infirmary before we beam your man down.
BECKETT
(into radio)
We already do, Doctor. Beam away.
[Ford is beamed into the infirmary with the Wraith that was feeding on
him when they fell still attached by its hand to his chest.]
BECKETT
Good Lord. Let's get this thing off of him.
[Beckett runs to the prone Ford, feeling for a pulse.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Ford is lying in an infirmary bed, unconscious. The camera zooms in on
him slowly as we hear the conversation.]
SHEPPARD
(voice)
How is he?
BECKETT
(voice)
I gave him a mild sedative to help him rest. But he should be dead.
SHEPPARD
(voice)
Well, he's a tough kid.
[We now see Weir, Beckett and Sheppard standing around Ford's bed.]
BECKETT
Not my point, Major. He was laying face down in the freezing water
for over an hour. I don't care how tough he is.
WEIR
So, what are you saying?
BECKETT
We still have no idea how it works, but during the Wraith feeding
process, the victim is injected with a special enzyme. It
strengthens the human body temporarily and ensures that the heart
continues to beat.
SHEPPARD
Why would they want to make you stronger?
BECKETT
So the victim doesn't die immediately. The feeding process is so
traumatic, without the special enzyme we shut down far sooner than
they like.
WEIR
They make you stronger so they can take more time to kill you.
BECKETT
Lovely, isn't it? In most cases, the enzyme is released slowly into
the blood stream throughout the feeding process. I can only
ascertain that the Wraith died quite suddenly and that Lieutenant
Ford's system became flooded with it.
WEIR
And that's why he was able to survive in the water for so long.
BECKETT
Exactly. The problem is now the enzyme is breaking down in his
system. Eventually there'll be none left.
SHEPPARD
That's not good.
BECKETT
No. In fact, I'm quite certain it will kill him. It's possible his
body's become dependent on the enzyme to function.
WEIR
What's the treatment?
BECKETT
We wean him off it, sneak his body chemistry back to normal
incrementally.
SHEPPARD
Then we're going to have to get more of this enzyme.
BECKETT
Aye. With your permission, Doctor, I'd like to harvest it from the
Wraith bodies in the morgue. I know it's a wee bit creepy, but...
MCKAY
(over radio)
Elizabeth. Major Sheppard.
WEIR

SHEPPARD
Aren't you supposed to be getting some sleep, Rodney?
MCKAY
I was trying to do just that, but someone thought I should know the
deep space sensors were back up and running.
WEIR
Yes, and?
ZELENKA
We've picked up twelve more hive ships traveling in hyperspace.
MCKAY
Their course and speed will bring them here in... thirty six hours.

exchange concerned looks.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Monitors around the room show the progress of the hive ships as
Caldwell paces past them angrily.]
CALDWELL
Twelve hive ships?
SHEPPARD
The cruisers that got away probably called for reinforcements.
MCKAY
Our research shows there are at least sixty hive ships in this
galaxy, so who knows how many more could be on the way.
SHEPPARD
At least the shield's up and running.
MCKAY
That only buys us time.
SHEPPARD
I like time.
MCKAY
(becoming agitated)
The first siege of Atlantis lasted for years. I mean, with only one
functioning ZPM, we can't expect to hold on that long.
CALDWELL
Can we submerge the city again?
MCKAY
(condescendingly)
It's a city, not a yo-yo. Look, I don't even know how they did it
the first time.
CALDWELL
How long until they arrive?
WEIR
A little over a day.
SHEPPARD
You know what? I'm sick of this.
WEIR
I'm sorry?
SHEPPARD
I mean sitting around waiting for them to show up. I say we take the
fight to them.
CALDWELL
We've got one ship, Major.
SHEPPARD
One ship with an Asgard shield, an armory full of nukes and beaming
technology. That evens the odds a hell of a lot.
CALDWELL
Twelve ships and their escorts.
SHEPPARD
I'm telling you, we've got to send these guys a message. We're not
like the Ancients. We're not going to sit around and wait. If they
don't back off, we have the capacity and the will to go kick their
asses for a change.
CALDWELL
How do I fight a ship in hyperspace?
MCKAY
The Wraith's faster-than-light travel is not as efficient as the
Asgard hyperdrive aboard the Daedalus. (indicating the display on
the monitor showing the hives' progress)
Not only are they slower, they need to travel in a series of jumps.
So, if my calculations are correct, they'll make one last stop here,
fifty light years away, before they make the final jump to Atlantis.
CALDWELL
Dr. Weir?
WEIR
It will feel good to have them on the defensive for a change.

Dr. Beckett released you?
FORD
Why wouldn't he? I'm fine.
[Teyla and Weir exchange concerned looks.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
If we can hit the first one or two as soon as they exit hyperspace,
I think that'll send a message.
CALDWELL
Who knows? Maybe they'll surrender.
KLEINMAN
Sir, we have a contact.
CALDWELL
Standby for weapons deployment. Shields at max power.
KLEINMAN
Shields up.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[Twelve Wraith ships drop out of hyperspace in front of the Daedalus.]
CALDWELL
(into radio)
Novak, this is Caldwell. Begin deployment at your discretion.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
HERMIOD
I have a weapons' lock on the coordinates of the first enemy vessel.
NOVAK
Got it. First weapon away, Colonel.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[The Wraith ship nearest to the Daedalus explodes.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The monitor shows one the twelve red dots disappearing.]
KLEINMAN
That's a kill.
NOVAK
(over radio)
Stand by.
[The monitor shows another red dot disappearing.]
SHEPPARD
All right, that's two.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
NOVAK
It's working.
HERMIOD
Stand by for coordinates.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
KLEINMAN
The other hive ships are altering course to intercept.
CALDWELL
Take us right at them.
COOPER
Yes, Sir.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[A firefight between the Daedalus and several Wraith ships ensues.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
SHEPPARD
They're flanking us.
CALDWELL
Forward rail guns return fire.
(into radio)
Novak, we need to speed up deployment of those nukes, or this fight
is going to be over soon.
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Sparks start flying in engineering.]
HERMIOD
The enemy has engaged countermeasures that are preventing our
ability to transport.
NOVAK
Is there a way to counter the countermeasures?
HERMIOD
None.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
NOVAK
(over radio)
Colonel, we have a problem. They've found a way to jam us from
beaming onto their ships. We don't know how.
[Sparks start flying on the bridge.]
KLEINMAN
Rear shield emitters are down to forty percent!
[An airman is hit by flying sparks and steam from a burst pipe and
falls to the ground; others rush to her aid. The situation on the
bridge is worsening.]
KLEINMAN
Ventral rail gun two is out of action!
CALDWELL
Bring subspace engines to max thrust.
COOPER
Yes, Sir.
CALDWELL
Try keeping the damaged shield from their main force.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[The firefight continues. We pan around to see a Wraith ship coming
into position above the Daedalus.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Warning sirens are blaring and people are trying to get damage under
control.]
KLEINMAN
Sir, one of the cruisers is approaching on a parallel course.
SHEPPARD
They may intend to board us. That was their strategy when they
attacked Atlantis.
CALDWELL
Shield status.
[The monitor shows shields getting lower.]
KLEINMAN
Under twenty percent.
CALDWELL
Set course for Atlantis and engage hyperdrive.
COOPER
Hyperdrive. Yes, Sir.
CALDWELL
This fight is over.
EXT--DAEDALUS IN SPACE
[The Daedalus flees the fight and jumps into hyperspace while the
Wraith continue their barrage of weapons fire.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
CALDWELL
(over radio)
Bottom line is, it didn't work.
WEIR
Well, at least you gave them something to think about.
CALDWELL
We'll see. I doubt very much if that tactic will work again.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
(into radio)
The Daedalus has sustained damage.
SHEPPARD
It was still the right thing to do.
(to Weir into radio)
We should make it home before they do.
WEIR
(over radio)
I hope so. We'll keep the porch light on for you.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Okay, what are our options?
MCKAY
Oh, let me see. We've got slow death, quick death, painful death,
cold, lonely death...
WEIR
Okay, you said yourself that the shield should buy us some time at
least.
[Weir is speaking to McKay and is taken aback by Ford's presence.]
FORD
Where do you want me?
WEIR
Lieutenant, I...
[The door opens and Beckett enters the control room. He's angry.]
BECKETT
Lieutenant, what do you think you're doing here?
FORD
I'm fine, Doc, really. It's cool.
BECKETT
The hell you are. You should be back in bed.
FORD
I feel great. Just drop it.
BECKETT
I will not "just drop it." Not 20 minutes ago, you were at death's
door. I don't care how spry you're feeling. You need to be under
medical supervision.
FORD
I'm good to go.
WEIR
I appreciate your enthusiasm, Lieutenant, but...
FORD
I'm serious. Just let me prove it. Just give me something to do.
BECKETT
I don't think so.
[Ford swings around and grabs Beckett by the throat, lifting him up and
pushing him against the glass wall.]
FORD
(furiously)
Don't push me around!
TEYLA
Lieutenant! Put him down, Aiden. He's trying to help you. Aiden.
[Ford slowly lowers Beckett to the ground, his expression changing from
fury to remorse.]
FORD
I'm sorry, Doc. I don't know why I...
BECKETT
(clutching at his throat, his voice cracking)
You need to be under medical supervision.
WEIR
He's right, Lieutenant. We just want to know why you're suddenly
feeling this way.
FORD
Okay. I'll go back.
WEIR
Good. That's what you should do.
FORD
Yes, Ma'am.
[Teyla escorts Ford from the room.]
WEIR
Sedate him if you have to.
BECKETT
Aye.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Ford is seemingly unconscious in a bed. Teyla and Weir stand by the
door and Beckett walks over to them.]
BECKETT
It's starting to affect his brain chemistry.
WEIR
There's no way you could have known that, Carson, and it's better
this than dead.
BECKETT
We need to be more aggressive, wean him off it quicker than I
expected to.
[Ford's eyes suddenly open and he lies still, listening to
conversation.]
BECKETT
It'll be painful and arduous, but I think it may be the only option.
I've sedated him, but he should definitely be under secure
supervision.
WEIR
I've already stationed a guard at the door.
CHUCK
(over radio)
Dr. Weir, the Daedalus is requesting permission to land on the east
pier.
WEIR
(into radio)
Permission granted. I'll meet them there.
[Weir walks away. Teyla and Beckett approach Ford's bed and he closes
his eyes, pretending to be unconscious.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The Daedalus lands on the pier.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Weir meets Caldwell, Sheppard and several airmen as they enter. They
walk through the city, talking.]
WEIR
Welcome back to Atlantis, Colonel.
SHEPPARD
The Wraith are right behind us.
WEIR
I wasn't expecting you to land.
CALDWELL
Until repairs are complete, the Daedalus is going to need Atlantis'
shields as much as you do.
CHUCK
(over radio)
Dr. Weir, the hive ships are emerging from hyperspace.
WEIR
We're on our way.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett and another doctor are helping a man in a neck brace while an
armed Marine patrols. As the Marine leaves the room, Ford grabs a metal
cup from beside his bed. The Marine hears and turns around as Ford
throws it at him. It hits the Marine in the face, knocking him to the
ground. Ford runs to him and takes his weapon.]
BECKETT
Ford!
FORD
Don't move or I'll shoot him.
(aiming the gun at Beckett)
Where's the rest of the enzyme?
BECKETT
There is no more.
FORD
I saw you extract it. Don't lie to me. Where is it?
BECKETT
No, I'm not lying!
[Ford fires at the shelves behind Beckett, who ducks out of the way.]
FORD
Where is it?
BECKETT
You're not thinking straight, son.
FORD
You're all afraid of me.
BECKETT
Look at what you're doing. We have good reason to be.
FORD
I'm going to die if I don't get it.
BECKETT
Aiden, you're not going to die!
FORD
Shut up!
(pointing the gun at the man in the neck brace)
I'm not going to ask again.
[Beckett goes to the fridge and takes out some I.V. bags filled with
red gel.]
FORD
Is that all of it?
BECKETT
I promise you.
FORD
Toss it over. Toss it!
[Beckett throws the bags to Ford.]
FORD
Don't follow me.
[Ford runs from the room.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay, Sheppard, Weir and Caldwell enter as an alarm sounds on Chuck's
control panel.]
CHUCK
They're getting into some sort of formation.
MCKAY
Move, move.
[McKay approaches a console and starts punching keys.]
EXT--SPACE
[The remaining hive ships are in space above the city and begin firing
on it.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The Wraith weapons' fire rains down on the shield.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Flashes of light and the sound of explosions have everyone concerned.]
MCKAY
The shield's holding under the bombardment, but it's under
incredible strain.
WEIR
How long will it hold?
MCKAY
If they'd stop firing at it, it'd last almost indefinitely but with
this kind of...
WEIR
Are we talking months? Weeks?
MCKAY
Days. At this rate, the ZPM will be depleted within days.
[Concerned looks are exchanged between Weir, Caldwell and Sheppard.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[Bright flashes like fireworks fill the sky as the Wraith weapons
explode on the shield above the city. McKay and Sheppard stand on a
balcony, watching the display.]
MCKAY
It's almost pretty, isn't it?
SHEPPARD
Almost. Not quite.
[They walk back inside.]
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay join Teyla, Weir, Caldwell, Zelenka and numerous
other personnel around the conference table.]
CALDWELL
We can get the Daedalus back into fighting form within 24 hours, but
I think the next engagement's going to have the same result.
WEIR
Even if we were able to destroy these ships this instant, more would
be here in a few days, and even more a few days after that. From
where I'm standing, I just don't see how we can win this.
MCKAY
Well, now we know how the Ancients must have felt.
ZELENKA
Atlantis is the only way to Earth. As long as they know we're here,
they're just going to keep coming.
SHEPPARD
"As long as they know that we're here."
WEIR
What do you mean?
SHEPPARD
Zelenka just said, "As long as they know that we're here, they'll
keep coming."
MCKAY
Yes, he said that.
SHEPPARD
What if they thought we were gone?
TEYLA
Then there'd be no reason for them to stay.
SHEPPARD
Exactly.
MCKAY
Exactly what?
SHEPPARD
We disappear.
CALDWELL
Destroy the city, you mean?
SHEPPARD
No, we just make it look like we did.
WEIR
How?
MCKAY
(clicking his fingers excitedly)
We cloak it.
ZELENKA
Yes! Yes! The Puddle Jumpers are equipped with cloaking technology,
which renders them invisible to the naked eye and to Wraith scans.
If we just simply remove one of the cloak generators from the Puddle
Jumper...
MCKAY
I wouldn't say "simply", but, yes. By interfacing a Jumper's stealth
mode generator with the city shield, we should be able to render the
city invisible.
CALDWELL
That's all well and good, but I think if the city were to suddenly
disappear, they might be able to put one and one together.
MCKAY
(wagging his finger and smiling smugly)
Which is why we fake a self-destruct. Have the Daedalus beam a nuke
right above the city shield and then detonate it. While their
sensors are blinded, we cloak the city. When the smoke clears...
WEIR
Nothing but ocean.
CALDWELL
What about hard radiation?
MCKAY
I should be able to calculate with reasonable accuracy how long to
wait before we switch over to cloak.
ZELENKA
What about the displacement issue?
MCKAY
That's coplanar emulation. That's the easy part.
ZELENKA
Okay. What about the hard part?
SHEPPARD
Hard part?
MCKAY
The cloak, for all intents and purposes, will replace the shield,
which means that we'll be completely unprotected once the cloak's
activated.
WEIR
We'll be completely exposed?
MCKAY
Well, yes.
CALDWELL
So if they're not fooled by the ruse...
SHEPPARD
Then they destroy the city. Which, I remind you, is exactly what we
were going to do anyway.
WEIR
What about the Daedalus?
CALDWELL
Well, if it doesn't work, our shield should be sufficiently
recharged to break through their lines and escape. We know we can
outrun them.
SHEPPARD
All right. Let's get as many non-essential personnel onto your ship
as we can, just in case.
WEIR
I love this idea, I really do, but the Wraith are aware that we have
cloaking technology.
TEYLA
They are close. Close enough for me to connect to them. If I can
convince them that we intend to destroy Atlantis rather than allow
it to be taken, just before the explosion occurs...
WEIR
How will we know whether or not they believe you?
SHEPPARD
Once they stop the bombardment, we'll know.
TEYLA
He's right. If the Wraith believe that we intend to destroy the
city, the last thing they'll want to do is to help us do it.
WEIR
How much time do you need?
MCKAY
Oh, uh...
ZELENKA
A week.
MCKAY
Couple of hours.
WEIR
I'll take the second estimate. Go.
[As everyone gets up to leave, McKay looks derisively at Zelenka.]
MCKAY
(snarkily)
What, are you union?
ZELENKA
(annoyed)
"Couple of hours."
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Beckett runs up the stairs from the gate room.]
BECKETT
He escaped.
TEYLA
What?
SHEPPARD
Who?
BECKETT
Ford. He was able to disarm one of the Marines and got away with all
the Wraith enzyme I had left.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Ford, this is Sheppard. Come in. Ford, I need you to come back to
the control room, buddy. We're all going home.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Ford is sitting in a darkened corridor having just injected himself
with some of the Wraith enzyme. He still has the rest in I.V. bags.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Lieutenant, do you copy?
FORD
(into radio)
You're just afraid of me, Major. You're afraid of what I can do now.
I'm not listening to you.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
SHEPPARD
I'm going after him.
[Sheppard hurries away.]
WEIR
(calling out after Sheppard)
Now's not the right time!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay and Zelenka, guarded by a Marine, are working on the Jumper's
cloaking device.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Personnel, including the injured, are boarding the Daedalus.]
INT--ATLANTIS WALKWAY
[Ford is sneaking around while Sheppard searches for him in the
darkened bowels of the city.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The Wraith barrage on the shield continues.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Teyla is lying on a bed with Beckett sitting by her.]
BECKETT
Now, I'm jolting you out of this the second I feel there's a
problem.
TEYLA
I understand.
BECKETT
(into radio)
We're all set down here.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay is at a console as Weir looks on.]
WEIR
Good. We're almost ready up here. Rodney?
MCKAY
Ready.
(into radio)
Radek.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
ZELENKA
Ready to go.
[Zelenka operates the dials on the Jumper's control panel.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
WEIR
(over radio)
Colonel Caldwell?
CALDWELL
Your people are securely aboard. Warhead has been armed and is ready
for deployment on your mark.
WEIR
Very good. Stand by.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Ford is sneaking around in the darkened corridor, but Sheppard is
aware of his position and is pursuing him with a Wraith stun weapon.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Dr. Beckett?
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
BECKETT
Teyla?
TEYLA
I am ready.
BECKETT
(into radio)
We're good to go.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
All right. Let's send our message.
[McKay works a computer.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Teyla goes into a trance-like state.]
INT--WRAITH SHIP
[We see Wraith walking along corridors.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
TEYLA
I'm on one of the ships.
INT--WRAITH SHIP
[We see Wraith walking along corridors.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
TEYLA
They see me.
[Beckett looks concerned, then Teyla gasps and sits up suddenly.]
BECKETT
Teyla?
TEYLA
The message has been delivered.
BECKETT
(into radio)
Elizabeth, it's done.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The barrage of weapons' fire against the shield ceases.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Seems that they heard Teyla loud and clear. Rodney?
MCKAY
Yeah, I think I'm ready.
WEIR
You "think"?!
MCKAY
I am definitely ready.
WEIR
(into radio)
Daedalus, launch the weapon.
(to Chuck)
Give me city-wide.
(over loudspeakers)
Attention all personnel. Prepare for detonation flash.
[McKay shuts the consoles down and puts on protective eyewear.]
MCKAY
Shut them down!
INT--DAEDALUS ENGINEERING
[Hermiod works at a console then gives Novak a nod.]
NOVAK
(into radio)
The weapon is away.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[A huge explosion is seen above the city and it is shrouded in a
massive cloud.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir and Chuck look up from where they had been covering their eyes as
Rodney takes off his eyewear and anxiously checks a computer.]
WEIR
Rodney?
MCKAY
If we switch to the cloak before the blast radius diminishes, we'll
all be incinerated. Five seconds.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
Stand by to engage sub-light engines on my mark.
COOPER
Standing by, Sir.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The fireball of the explosion and the resulting cloud spread up and
out over the city.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Okay, that was definitely five seconds!
[McKay hits some keys on the computer.]
MCKAY
We're cloaked.
WEIR
How can you tell?
MCKAY
(whispering)
They're scanning for us.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard is advancing along a darkened corridor with the Wraith stun
weapon ready to fire. He approaches Ford, who is standing in the light,
his weapon aimed at Sheppard.]
FORD
I could've shot you a couple of times by now.
[Sheppard lowers his weapon.]
SHEPPARD
Well... I'm glad you didn't.
[Ford lowers his weapon.]
SHEPPARD
(advancing slowly)
Look, why don't you and I just go someplace where we can talk.
FORD
(backing away)
You're trying to change me back.
SHEPPARD
(still advancing)
No. I'm just trying to help you.
FORD
(shakes his head)
No, you're not.
[Ford turns and walks into a transporter.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, crap.
[Sheppard fire the stun weapon and hits Ford in the back. Ford just
turns and looks angrily at him as he punches a destination on the
console. As the transporter doors close, Sheppard runs towards them,
but when they open again, Ford is gone.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(whispering)
I don't think they've detected us.
WEIR
(whispering)
Why are you whispering?
MCKAY
I don't know. It just seems like the right thing to do.
WEIR
Is it working or not?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Zelenka is walking along punching buttons on a handheld device. As he
turns from one corridor into another, he is punched in face by Ford and
falls to the ground. Ford grabs a bag from the floor and runs away.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate starts dialling.]
WEIR
What the hell?!
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Ford is at the controls of a Jumper, dialing the 'gate.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[McKay works at the console. Sheppard runs in.]
SHEPPARD
Where's Ford?
MCKAY
(angrily)
I assume that's him in that Jumper.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[The Jumper descends and positions itself in front of the open
wormhole.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Can they detect that?
MCKAY
I don't know.
WEIR
Shut it down.
MCKAY
I can't. The Jumper's in control.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Ford is at the Jumper controls and Sheppard is standing in front of
it.]
SHEPPARD
Ford! Stand down! This is a direct order!
[Ford looks defiantly at Sheppard then flies the Jumper through the
'gate. The wormhole disconnects. Sheppard is left standing by the
'gate.]
SHEPPARD
(calling up to the control room)
Where the hell is he going?
WEIR
It won't matter if the Wraith can detect the gate activity through
the cloak.
MCKAY
There's only one way to know.
[McKay and Weir stand in silence, listening for sounds of Wraith
attack.]
CALDWELL
(over radio)
This is Daedalus. Our sensors indicate the Wraith fleet is breaking
orbit.
MCKAY
(checking his computer)
I can confirm that. They're headed for hyperspace.
(relieved)
Look, I'm going to keep the cloak up for a while just to be sure,
but, uh...I think they bought it.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard is still standing in front of the 'gate as Weir goes to join
him.]
WEIR
The gate address will be in the log. There's still a chance...
SHEPPARD
Doesn't matter where he goes. The second he gets to wherever he's
going, he's going to ditch the Jumper, turn around, and dial another
address, one we can't trace.
WEIR
We'll find him.
SHEPPARD
Maybe.
WEIR
Hey. At least we're still around to try.
SHEPPARD
Yeah.
[Sheppard walks away.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[The city appears from the cloak.]
FADE OUT
