   EXT--SPACE

   [A puddle jumper flies into high orbit from the planet.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Sheppard is alone in the cockpit.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into comm)
     Atlantis, uh, this is Sheppard. I'm on approach to the 'gate.

   [Sheppard takes a bite of an apple.]

     MCKAY

     (over comm)
     Acknowledged.

   INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM

   [McKay stands by one of the control stations.]

     MCKAY
     You know, since I've been in Pegasus, I have set up, like what, half
     a dozen research stations on various planets? And I don't remember
     you ever volunteering to run a resupply mission to any of them.

   [The rest of the conversation switches between the control room and
   puddle jumper.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm a busy man, Rodney. I just happen to have a little free time.

     MCKAY
     And Doctor MacKenzie just happens to be studying a primitive tribe
     that lives in a tropical paradise and has, how did he put it?
     "Little or no social inhibitions."

     SHEPPARD
     Well, they were very friendly.

   [An explosion rocks the puddle jumper.]

     SHEPPARD

     (distracted)
     What the hell?

     MCKAY

     (concerned)
     What is it?

   [Sheppard brings up the HUD and studies the display.]

     SHEPPARD
     I think somebody just took a shot at me. I've got contact. They're
     closing fast.

     MCKAY
     Was it Wraith?

     SHEPPARD
     I don't think so, but--

   [Another explosion hits, again rocking the ship.]

     SHEPPARD

     (worried)
     Whatever they're shooting me with just shorted my systems. I can't
     get weapons online.

   [More shots hit, and the puddle jumper powers down. All the lights and
   controls darken.]

     MCKAY

     (frantic)
     Can you make it back to the 'gate? Sheppard?!

     SHEPPARD
     Rodney? McKay?!

   [The power shutdown has also affected communications. They've lost
   contact with each other.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A very large ship envelopes the puddle jumper and immediately blasts
   into hyperspace.]

   END TEASER

   OPENING CREDITS

   INT--CORRIDORS, TRAVELERS' SHIP

   [Sheppard is led through the corridors by two men, Silas and Nevik.
   Sheppard's hands are bound behind him. The interior of the ship is
   filled with debris and disuse.]

     SHEPPARD
     Nice ship. Little bit of a fixer-upper, but I can see the potential.

   [He trips on a cord.]

   INT--HOLDING ROOM

   [The men open the door to a small room. The lights flicker on. Sheppard
   is shoved into a room. The men follow.]

     SHEPPARD
     I'm not talking about anything drastic, you know. Maybe just a paint
     job, some throw pillows...

   [Nevik wrenches Sheppard's arm.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ow!

   [Nevik injects Sheppard's arm, taking a vial of blood. When finished he
   releases Sheppard, tapping him on the arm as he leaves. Silas remains,
   shoving Sheppard towards a bed.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look, I don't suppose you want to tell me what's going on here?

     SILAS
     Here's how we're gonna do this. I'm gonna ask you questions, and
     you're gonna give me answers. Is that simple enough for you?

     SHEPPARD

     (shrugging)
     Sure.

     SILAS
     Who are you, where are you from, and where'd you get your ship?

     SHEPPARD
     See, that's a funny coincidence, because I was going to ask you the
     same exact questions.

   [Silas punches Sheppard in the stomach. He falls to his knees.]

     SILAS
     The difference is, I'm not the one whose hands are tied behind his
     back. So again, who are you, where are you from, and where did you
     get your ship?

   [Sheppard looks trapped and still doesn't answer.]

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR

   [Teyla, McKay and Ronon walk out of the Gate Room and through the
   corridors.]

     TEYLA
     What happened?

     MCKAY
     I'm not entirely sure. It looks like Sheppard's jumper was attacked
     before it could reach the space gate.

     RONON
     By who?

     MCKAY
     Well, the people on the planet aren't much past mud huts and blow
     darts, so I think we can assume they had nothing to do with it. What
     we do know that just before we lost contact, there was a short burst
     of radiation in the vicinity of the 'gate, consistent with the
     opening of a hyperspace window.

     RONON
     Wraith?

     MCKAY
     Sheppard didn't seem to think so, and what little sensor data we've
     been able to pick up from the jumper seems to confirm it. The energy
     signature's all wrong. It's inconsistent with Ancient technology as
     well, which pretty much rules out the Replicators.

     TEYLA
     We know of no other peoples in this galaxy that possess hyperspace
     technology.

     MCKAY
     Of course not. No one reaches anywhere near that level of
     advancement without being culled.

     RONON
     So then who was it?

   INT--HOLDING ROOM, TRAVELERS' SHIP

   [Silas continues to punch Sheppard. His face is bloody from the abuse.]

     SILAS
     I could do this all day.

   [Sheppard's mouth drips blood.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh, your knuckles'll get sore eventually.

   [Before Silas can throw another punch. The door opens and an attractive
   woman enters with Nevik.]

     LARRIN
     Has he said anything?

     SILAS
     Only his name. Reed Richards.

     LARRIN
     His name is Sheppard. We intercepted part of his last radio
     transmission.

     SHEPPARD
     I didn't catch your name.

   [Larrin lifts his chin and studies the damage to his face.]

     LARRIN
     You can call me Larrin. You really should cooperate. It would be a
     shame to have to do too much damage.

   [She starts to leave.]

     SHEPPARD
     I agree. Maybe if you guys tell me who you are and what you want, we
     could work out some kind of a deal.

     LARRIN

     Well, don't get my hopes up and then disappoint me.
     (to Silas)
     Tell him what happened to the last man that disappointed me.

     SILAS
     We don't know. We never found his body.

     NEVIK
     We assumed you blew him out into space.

   [Sheppard cracks a pained smile.]

     SHEPPARD
     I get it.

     LARRIN
     Good. Bring him.

   [She leaves.]

     SILAS
     Get up.

   [Silas and Nevik wrestle Sheppard to his feet and lead him out.]

   INT--OFFICERS' MESS, TRAVELERS' SHIP

   [Larrin and Sheppard are seated at a large dining table. Sheppard's
   hands are free. He is brought a tray full of unappetizing looking brown
   food. He looks at it in distaste.]

     SHEPPARD
     Another form of torture?

     LARRIN
     When you've spent as much time in space as we do, you don't get a
     lot of fresh food.

   [Sheppard picks up a gelatinous oblong shaped piece of food and dangles
   it.]

     SHEPPARD
     How much...time are we talking about?

   [Larrin tilts her head, but says nothing. Sheppard drops the food back
   onto the tray.]

     SHEPPARD
     This is a conversation, right? A two-way street?

     LARRIN
     This is our home.

     SHEPPARD
     This ship?

     LARRIN
     And others like it. We're travelers.

     SHEPPARD
     You live in space all the time.

     LARRIN
     We land on planets when we need to--for supplies, trade. The rest of
     the time, we keep moving.

   [Sheppard studies a thick block of tan food.]

     SHEPPARD
     From the Wraith?

     LARRIN
     That may have been how it started, but now it's just who we are.

   [He drops the food.]

     SHEPPARD
     Well, no offense, uh, Larrin, but it doesn't sound like much of a
     life.

   [Larrin stands and gets something to drink.]

     LARRIN
     Being a herd animal isn't much of a life. Besides, the food has all
     the nutrients required.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, as tempting as that sounds...my jaw is a little sore right
     now.

     LARRIN
     Things like that are necessary from time to time. Although it's not
     the most efficient way of getting information, it does help people
     to understand...their situation.

   [She sets the drink down beside Sheppard, then leans against the
   table.]

     SHEPPARD
     My situation being...completely at your mercy.

     LARRIN
     Exactly. Anyway, I know more about you than you think.

   [She sits in the chair next to him.]

     SHEPPARD
     Really?

     LARRIN
     Mm-hmm. For instance, I know you that you carry the gene required to
     operate Lantian technology.

     SHEPPARD

     (feigning ignorance)
     I've got the what?

   [Larrin rolls her eyes.]

     LARRIN
     Look, Sheppard, I know you have your secrets. And if you stay on my
     good side, I may even let you keep a few of them. However, if you
     continue to play ignorant with me, I really will jettison you out
     into space. For some time now, we've been hearing rumors about a new
     group of humans in the galaxy using the technology of the Ancestors
     to do battle with the Wraith. So, we set up a network of spy
     satellites around dozens of worlds with space gates, hoping for an
     encounter. Eventually we got lucky.

     SHEPPARD
     And in the first meeting between our people, you attack me and
     disarm my ship.

     LARRIN
     Well, you were going through the 'gate, and I couldn't let that
     happen. You see, anyone capable of operating Lantian technology is
     of particular interest to us.

     SHEPPARD
     That's why you took a sample of my blood.

   [He takes a drink, then grimaces in distaste.]

     LARRIN
     We're working on a control interface adaptor that requires a small
     amount of necessary genetic material. We needed your blood to test
     it.

     SHEPPARD
     I'm going to guess it didn't go so well.

     LARRIN
     Why would you say that?

     SHEPPARD
     Then you wouldn't have any use for me anymore.

     LARRIN
     Don't underestimate yourself. There's all kinds of useful things you
     could do for me.

   [Sheppard is taken aback but intrigued.]

     NEVIK

     (over comm)
     Commander, we're approaching the coordinate.

   [Larrin stands.]

     LARRIN

     (into comm)
     Understood. Take us out of hyperspace.
     (to Sheppard)
     Of course you're right. The interface isn't fully operational yet.
     Come with me.

   [A guard approaches to make sure Sheppard complies. Keeping a wary eye
   on the guard, Sheppard follows Larrin out.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, TRAVELERS' SHIP

     LARRIN
     Nevik, my chief science officer, insists that we have a much better
     chance of perfecting the interface if we reverse engineer it using
     Lantian technology that's already been initialized.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't even know what "reverse engineering" is.

   [Larrin opens the door to the ship bay. The puddle jumper sits inside.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh. You want to use my ship.

     LARRIN
     Not exactly.

   [She nods to the guard. He shoves Sheppard inside. Larrin closes the
   door, locking Sheppard alone inside.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hey!

     LARRIN

     (to guard)
     Activate the force shield.

   INT--HANGAR BAY, TRAVELERS' SHIP

   [A shield activates under Sheppard's feet.]

     LARRIN

     (over intercom)
     Sheppard? Can you hear me?

   [The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard and Larrin's
   positions.]

     SHEPPARD
     You mind telling me what you're doing?

     LARRIN
     Offering you a deal. Open the hangar bay doors.

   [The floor beneath Sheppard retracts. Only the shield he stands on
   protects him from the vacuum of space.]

     SHEPPARD

     (holding back panic)
     This is just not right!

     LARRIN

     (nonchalantly)
     Don't worry. Your safe as long as the force shield doesn't
     malfunction, and...that almost never happens.

     SHEPPARD

     (angry over his fear)
     Why are you doing this?

     LARRIN
     You wanted to know what this was all about? Look beneath you.

   [An Aurora class Ancient ship appears below his feet.]

     LARRIN
     I'm assuming you recognize the technology. It's a Lantian
     battleship. It's been dormant for thousands of years, and you're
     going to help me get it operational again.

   [Sheppard watches the ship pass beneath him.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Both ships move slowly in formation.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, ANCIENT SHIP

     SHEPPARD
     Has it occurred to you people they might have abandoned this ship
     for a good reason in the first place?

     LARRIN
     We know the reason. We were able to access the ship's logs.

     NEVIK
     They were attacked by the Wraith. They lost communication, and their
     shields were failing. The engines were damaged as well but they
     managed to escape into hyperspace. Then they realized that their
     main drive was giving off deadly radiation. They were forced to
     abandon ship.

     LARRIN
     They intended to return and affect repairs but never got the chance.
     The ship's been drifting in a two hundred year elliptical orbit
     around a nearby dwarf star ever since.

     SHEPPARD
     So it's never been fixed.

     LARRIN
     No.

     SHEPPARD
     I hate to point out the obvious, but one of the reasons I agreed to
     help you was so that you wouldn't kill me. If I'm going to die of
     radiation anyway--

     LARRIN
     Don't worry. We've set up shield emitters to protect key areas of
     the ship, and we've all got radiation detectors.

   [She holds up her arm to show a device on her sleeve. Sheppard looks at
   the others, then looks at his own arm which notably has no detector.]

     LARRIN
     Take him to the bridge. Start with sub-light propulsion. I'll go
     check the emitters.

   [Larrin walks away.]

     SHEPPARD

     (calling after her)
     Don't think I could get one of those two, do you?

   [Silas shoves Sheppard to start moving the other direction.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Nevik points to the central chair.]

     NEVIK
     Here.

     SHEPPARD
     You know, this ship is ten thousand years old. I'm just saying, for
     the record. If it doesn't work, it's not my fault.

     NEVIK
     Just get on with it.

   [Sheppard sits in the chair and touches the side controls. Panels all
   over the bridge come to life.]

     NEVIK
     Amazing. I've been trying for two months to activate these systems.
     I need to calibrate the interface for neural input. Why don't you
     start by moving the ship forward.

     SHEPPARD
     You sure about that?

     NEVIK
     That's why we're here. You fly the ship, and I record the inputs so
     I can replicate them.

     SHEPPARD
     Okay, but--

   [Silas unholsters his gun and points it at Sheppard.]

     SILAS
     Enough. Fly the damn ship.

     SHEPPARD
     Right. I was just going to say, you said "start by moving the ship
     forward", when you should've said "start by initializing the
     inertial dampeners."

   [Nevik realizes his mistake as soon as Sheppard is speaking. He holds
   up his hand.]

     NEVIK
     Wait!

   [His warning is too late. Sheppard activates the controls. He's thrown
   back into his chair, but remains in it. The two standing men are thrown
   across the room. In another part of the ship, Larrin too is thrown into
   a wall and drops to the deck.]

   [Sheppard stops the ship and gets out of the chair. He rushes over and
   grabs the gun from where it has fallen beside Silas. He points it at
   Silas, but the man is too stunned to react. Sheppard takes a closer
   look at the weapon.]

     SHEPPARD
     I have a friend who's got a gun just like this. I always wondered
     where he got it.

   [Sheppard moves to one of the stations on the bridge.]

     SILAS
     I'm gonna kill you.

   [He starts to sit up, but Sheppard fires, stunning both Silas and
   Nevik. Sheppard moves away from the station.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin stands with a groan.]

     LARRIN

     (into comm)
     Silas, what happened? Nevik, what's going on up there?

   INT--BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard grabs Silas's radio.]

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     Sorry, your people aren't available right now.

     LARRIN

     (into comm)
     Sheppard, what are you doing?

     SHEPPARD

     (over radio)
     You said fly the ship...

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     ...And I'm flying the ship.

   [He gets back in the chair and opens a hyperspace window.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Ancient ship shoots into hyperspace, leaving Larrin's ship
   behind.]

   INT--CORRIDOR, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin is able to see through a window that the ship is now flying
   through hyperspace. She starts storming down the corridor.]

     LARRIN
     We had a deal! I was prepared to let you go in exchange for your
     help.

   INT--BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP

     SHEPPARD
     I'm sorry, I've never been able to trust anyone who kidnaps me, and
     tortures me, and threatens to blow me into space!

   EXT--ALIEN PLANET, DAY

   [A puddle jumper flies over the tree tops.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Lorne flies the ship. The rest of Sheppard's team is in the cockpit
   with him. Lorne and McKay study the HUD.]

     MCKAY
     We've got nothing. There's no wreckage, no transponder signal. If he
     was down there, we would've found him by now.

     TEYLA
     Then where is he?

     MCKAY
     Well, he's not in orbit, and he's not on the planet, so the only
     logical assumption is that whoever attacked him must've brought him
     on board before they jumped into hyperspace.

     RONON
     So what's the next step?

     MCKAY
     There is no next step! Look, we have no way of tracing him. He could
     be anywhere in the galaxy by now. I'm sorry, but sometimes there is
     just nothing we can do.

   INT--BRIDGE

     LARRIN

     (over comm)
     Sheppard, I want you to drop this ship out of hyperspace.

     SHEPPARD

     (into radio)
     I don't think so.

     LARRIN
     Listen to me. I've shut off the shield emitters protecting your area
     of the ship. Right now, the bridge is being flooded with radiation.

     SHEPPARD
     You're bluffing. You'd never sacrifice your own people.

   [He pauses and listens to a blinking sound behind him. The spins the
   chair to look at the trussed Silas and Nevik. They are looking down at
   the radiation monitors, which are beeping.]

     LARRIN
     Look, I don't want to kill you, but if you don't turn over the
     controls of this ship, I'll have no choice.

   [Sheppard takes a deep breath, then shuts down the hyperspace engine.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The Ancient ship drops out of hyperspace.]

   INT--BRIG, ANCIENT SHIP

   [A despondent Sheppard looks through the bars at Larrin.]

     LARRIN
     You surprise me, Sheppard.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, as long as I didn't disappoint you.

     LARRIN
     Oh no, I knew you'd make some sort of a move, I just wasn't
     expecting anything quite so...?

     SHEPPARD
     Clever? Creative?

     LARRIN
     Reckless! You could've killed all of us, including yourself.

   [The step to the side where only a force field separates them.]

     SHEPPARD
     I once pulled eleven G's in an F-16 without passing out. I figured I
     had a shot.

     LARRIN
     Well, I underestimated you.

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, I feel the same way. I mean, you've got the whole
     tough-as-nails routine down pat. But exposing your own people to
     killer radiation. It takes a special kind of lady to do that,
     doesn't it?

   [Larrin smiles. Nevik arrives]

     NEVIK
     Larrin?

   [She joins him.]

     NEVIK

     (low, to Larrin)
     It's not good. He shut down the propulsion and navigation system
     before he turned over the bridge.

     LARRIN

     (scoffing)
     Of course he did. Did you collect enough data to finish the control
     interface?

     NEVIK
     I don't know. Maybe.

   [Sheppard goes to the cot and collapses on it, feigning disinterest.]

     LARRIN
     Nevik, if you can't do this, we're stranded.

   [Nevik looks over at Sheppard.]

     NEVIK
     What about him?

     LARRIN
     He's not going anywhere near that bridge again. He can't be trusted.

     NEVIK
     Listen, if we can't bring the system back online, he'll die out here
     like the rest of us.

     LARRIN
     That's the problem. Does he look like a man who thinks he's going to
     die?

   [They look at Sheppard, who looks bored.]

     LARRIN
     Check the subspace communications array.

     NEVIK
     The Ancients lost the communications in the battle with the Wraith.
     They system was never repaired.

     LARRIN

     (demanding)
     Check it.

   [Nevik leaves. Larrin sighs.]

   INT--MCKAY'S LAB

   [McKay types at a computer. Ronon and Teyla enter.]

     RONON
     What have you got?

     MCKAY

     (chipper)
     Ah. Remember how I said sometimes there's nothing we can do? Well, I
     was right about that. Only it only turns out, this is not one of
     those times.

   [He goes to a different computer.]

     TEYLA
     You found him.

     MCKAY
     Hmm. More like he found us. Listen to this.

   [He starts a recording. A low, popping static can be heard.]

     MCKAY
     That is the sound of subspace. Now, it's mostly just random noise
     generated by various forms of radiation. But the Ancients, in their
     infinite wisdom created a program that could sniff out artificial
     patterns. Now, it's, uh, no doubt a long-range means of detecting
     advanced life forms, kind of like our SETI program only much more
     powerful, because it operates through subspace. Anyway, it picked up
     this.

   [Teyla and Ronon look at McKay blankly, but listen to the pattern McKay
   amplifies. Through the static a clear pattern of dot-dot-dot,
   dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot, can be heard.]

     TEYLA
     What is it?

     MCKAY
     That's Sheppard. Now I don't know why he didn't just send a regular
     message. But maybe he was dealing with a damaged transmitter, or
     maybe he was trying to communicate without being detected. But it's
     definitely him.

     RONON
     How do you know it's him?

     MCKAY
     It's Morse code! S.O.S.

   [Ronon and Teyla look blankly back at McKay.]

   INT--CELL, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin storms in, shutting down the cell barrier.]

     SHEPPARD
     What's happening?

   [Larrin punches Sheppard in the face. He stumbles back, then turns
   around angry.]

     SHEPPARD
     What was that for?!

     LARRIN
     Do you realize what you've done?

     SHEPPARD
     I didn't do anything.

   [She punches him in the face again, forcing his head back. He groans.]

     SHEPPARD
     Stop that!

     LARRIN
     I'll stop when you stop lying. You adapted the damaged
     communications array to send out a signal, didn't you?

   [Sheppard hesitates and thinks before answering.]

     SHEPPARD
     Yes.

   [She punches him again, very hard. He spins around and falls to his
   knees.]

     SHEPPARD
     You said...you'd stop that!

     LARRIN
     You're right. Maybe I'll just shoot you.

   [She unholsters her pistol and powers it up. Sheppard raises his hands
   in a placating gesture.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. Don't you think you're overreacting a little?

     LARRIN
     You were trying to broadcast our location? Guess what, it worked!
     There's a ship approaching, only I don't think it's the one you were
     hoping for!

     SHEPPARD
     What do you mean?

     LARRIN
     It's the Wraith!

   EXT--SPACE

   [A hive ship drops out of hyperspace and flies to the Ancient
   battleship.]

   INT--BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Silas and Nevik are on the bridge. The ship is rocked by a blast.]

   INT--CELL, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin still holds her gun on Sheppard while the ship is hit by more
   blasts.]

     NEVIK

     (over comm)
     The Wraith ship is firing on us.

     LARRIN

     (into comm)
     Do we have shields?

   INT--BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP

     NEVIK

     (into comm)
     Affirmative. But they're only at twenty percent. We can't take this
     for very long.

   [Another blast rocks the ship.]

   INT--CELL, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin and Sheppard barely keep their balance after that last strike.
   Sheppard gets off his knees]

     SHEPPARD
     If you want get out of this alive, you're gonna need my help. Now I
     realize that you and I don't exactly trust each other, but...that's
     not gonna make that much difference if the Wraith blow this ship up,
     is it?

   [He pushes her gun to one side. More rumbles can be heard throughout
   the ship.]

     LARRIN

     (scared)
     What have you got in mind?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you can start by shooting back.

     LARRIN
     Right.

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard and Larrin run through a corridor. They pause at an
   intersection.]

     LARRIN
     The weapons control platform is down that corridor. I'm heading back
     to the bridge.

     SHEPPARD
     Keep the shields up as long as you can.

   [They split off.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard arrives in the room, which lights up at his presence. He sits
   in the chair and activates it.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship continues to fire on the Ancient ship, a blast getting
   through the shields.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [The chair shorts out.]

     SHEPPARD

     (caustic)
     Great.

   [He gets up and looks at the control panel in the back of the chair.]

     SHEPPARD
     Piece of cake.

   INT--BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP

     NEVIK
     Shields are down.

     SILAS
     Can't you reroute any more power?

     NEVIK
     There's nothing I can do.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The hive ship fires again. This time the blast is a direct strike to
   the bridge, killing Nevik and Silas.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Larrin loses her balance and slams up against a closed door as she
   makes her way to the bridge. The door stays shut, even as she tries to
   open it.]

     LARRIN

     (into comm)
     Silas, Nevik, what happened? Do you read me?

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard is able to reroute power to the chair and get it working
   again. He instantly jumps back into the seat and concentrates.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A group of Ancient ship drones attack the Wraith ship, destroying it.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard sits up.]

     SHEPPARD

     (over comm)
     Larrin, it's Sheppard.

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

     LARRIN

     (into comm, confused)
     I didn't give you a communicator.

   [The conversation switches between Larrin's and Sheppard's locations.]

     SHEPPARD
     I activated the ship's intercom. What happened?

     LARRIN
     I don't know. The forward section's been sealed off.

     SHEPPARD
     What about your people?

     LARRIN
     They're not responding.

     SHEPPARD
     The good news is, the Wraith ship's been destroyed.

     LARRIN
     Stay where you are. I'm coming to you.

   [Larrin runs down another corridor, while in the chair room, Sheppard
   looks askance at the door.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin arrives in the empty chair room.]

   INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard studies various controls.]

     LARRIN

     (over comm)
     Sheppard, where are you?

     SHEPPARD
     Auxiliary control room.

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin starts to head out but the doors shut, trapping her inside.]

     LARRIN
     Sheppard..?

   [The conversation switches between Larrin's and Sheppard's locations.]

     SHEPPARD
     Sorry about this.

     LARRIN
     What are you doing?

     SHEPPARD
     For the moment, not much. Hyperdrive seems to be offline.

     LARRIN
     What?! How bad is it?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, it's not exactly my area of expertise. But if I'm reading this
     thing right, the drive itself is undamaged. It's probably just a
     short in the control system.

     LARRIN
     Then we can take care of it through a simple bypass. Just let me
     out, and I should be able to fix it.

     SHEPPARD
     No, I don't think so.

     LARRIN

     (furious)
     We're a floating target out here, Sheppard!

     SHEPPARD
     All right, take it easy! I cut the transmitter off. My people
     should've gotten the message by now.

     LARRIN
     There is no reason to assume that Wraith ship didn't broadcast our
     position.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, there's no reason to assume they did.

     LARRIN
     Listen to me here, Sheppard! I've spent my entire life around
     hyperdrive systems! I know what I'm doing!

     SHEPPARD
     I never said I didn't believe you. Don't worry. My people will be
     here.

   EXT--SPACE

   [A puddle jumper flies through an active space Stargate, joining four
   others floating above a planet.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

   [Lorne and the others of Sheppard's team are in one of the puddle
   jumpers. The HUD displays the star system they've just entered.]

     MCKAY
     Sheppard was broadcasting from somewhere in the vicinity of this
     system.

     LORNE
     Well, sensors aren't picking up anything.

     MCKAY
     Let me see if I can expand the range a little.

   [He presses some controls. The map zooms out, showing a blinking object
   outside the system.]

     MCKAY
     There.

     TEYLA
     What is it?

     MCKAY
     Well, it could be a ship. They're still too far too get any detailed
     readings, but that's gotta be them.

     LORNE
     How long to get there at maximum sublight?

   [McKay checks his readings.]

     MCKAY
     It's, uh, five hours.

     LORNE

     (into comm)
     This is Lorne to all jumpers. I'm sending you some coordinates.
     Proceed to target at maximum sublight.
     (to McKay)
     Go ahead.

   [McKay activates the engines.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin takes off the door control panel and tries to short-circuit the
   system with her knife. She gets shocked.]

   INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [An alarm sounds. Sheppard moves to another control.]

     SHEPPARD
     Larrin, what are you doing? Look, once my people get here and get
     the hyperdrive back online, we'll drop you off at the nearest 'gate.
     You have my word.

   [The conversation switches between Larrin's and Sheppard's locations.]

     LARRIN
     Not good enough.

     SHEPPARD
     What, my word or my deal?

     LARRIN
     How about both?

     SHEPPARD
     You're the one who kidnapped me, remember?

     LARRIN
     Because I need this ship.

   [The controls short out again. Sheppard presses a control from his
   location and all power shuts down in the chair room.]

     SHEPPARD
     There. I did you a favor.

   [Larrin sets her jaw.]

     LARRIN
     Sheppard...? Listen to me. Our fleet is old. There was a time when
     we had the resources to build new ships, but now we don't. When we
     lose one, it's gone for good. And despite strict population
     controls, there just isn't enough room for all of us anymore. We've
     been forced to abandon some of our own people on the ground.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, they're no worse off than the rest of the people in this
     galaxy.

     LARRIN
     Fine. We'll do this the hard way.

   [She unholsters her pistol and fires it repeatedly at the door. The
   sound can be heard through the comm system.]

     SHEPPARD

     (sighing)
     Larrin, what are you doing?

   [The door now has a large enough hold blasted through the center of it
   for Larrin to get out.]

   [Sheppard presses a control button in the room.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [A shield goes up, blocking Larrin's path as she heads down the hall.]

     LARRIN
     Sheppard, you are really starting to annoy me!

     SHEPPARD
     Just sit tight! It'll be over soon enough.

     LARRIN

     (keying comm)
     Silas, Nevik, come in. Silas, do you read me?

     SHEPPARD
     Give it up, they're gone.

     LARRIN
     You don't know that!

     SHEPPARD
     No, but I can find out.

   [Sheppard moves to another control panel showing a schematic of the
   ship.]

     SHEPPARD
     Looks like there's no one alive in the forward section. I'm sorry.

   [Larrin heads down the hall in the other direction. Sheppard watches
   from his life signs schematic.]

     SHEPPARD
     Larrin, where are you going? I can track you anywhere in this ship.
     You can't hide from me.

   [His eyes widen as he sees something else.]

     SHEPPARD

     (abrupt)
     Larrin, stop! I'm picking up another life sign directly in front of
     you.

     LARRIN
     Silas...

   [She starts running to the door at the end of the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     That's impossible. There's no way he got out of that section alive.

   [Larrin opens the door, surprising a Wraith who turns and snarls at
   her.]

   [Frightened, Larrin backs away. The Wraith advances, smiling. Larrin
   unholsters her gun, but he knocks it aside before she can fire. He
   raises his feeding hand, but Larrin stabs it with her knife. The Wraith
   cries out in pain, but pulls it out. They engage in hand-to-hand
   combat, but the Wraith has the advantage. He knocks her down and pulls
   his own stunner. Before he can fire he's shot several times in the back
   by Sheppard, who's retrieved Larrin's stunner.]

     SHEPPARD
     You all right?

     LARRIN
     I'm fine. He just caught me off-guard.

     SHEPPARD
     They must've escaped in the darts before their ship was destroyed.
     We left the hangar bay pressurized; they flew right in.

     LARRIN
     They?

     SHEPPARD
     Yeah, there's three more. We can track them with this.

   [He holds up a handheld scanner.]

     LARRIN
     Where'd you get that?

     SHEPPARD
     Auxiliary Control Room. You gotta know where to look. Come on.

   [He heads down the hall. Larrin starts to follow, then turns back.]

     LARRIN
     I'll get his weapon.

   [As she grabs the stunner, the Wraith grabs her ankle. She cried out in
   surprise as Sheppard shoots the Wraith more times.]

     SHEPPARD
     Tenacious little bastards, aren't they?

   [He checks the charge on Larrin's weapon.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't suppose you have any more of these?

     LARRIN
     I'm afraid not. And I don't think this is going to be much good
     either.

   [She handles the Wraith stunner which has been fried by one of the
   blasts. It's useless. They head down the corridor.]

   [They run down a corridor. Sheppard pauses at an intersection, raising
   his hand.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hold up! We've got one coming this way.

   [He heads to the nearest door, which leads to a small storage room.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

     LARRIN
     What now?

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [A Wraith stalks down the hall.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard uses his scanner to find a hidden closet in the room. He
   opens it.]

     LARRIN
     Wait. No. Sheppard, what-what are you doing?

   [Sheppard grabs her by the lapel of her jacket and drags her into the
   closet. The door shuts behind them.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM CLOSET, ANCIENT SHIP

     LARRIN
     What? Oh, brilliant plan. Get us--

   [Sheppard covers her mouth. Defiantly, she bites it.]

     SHEPPARD
     Ow!

   [She slaps her hand over his mouth. He replaces his hand on hers. They
   glare at each other.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [The Wraith pauses outside the storage room door. He opens the door and
   looks in. Seeing nothing, he closes the door and continues on his way.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM CLOSET, ANCIENT SHIP

   [As the door closes, they each release each other's mouths. Sheppard
   watches his scanner. He sees the three Wraith joining up right outside
   the storage room.]

     SHEPPARD
     There's the other two. What, are they having a board meeting?

   [Larrin sighs in exasperation.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [The five puddle jumpers fly through space at sublight speeds.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     It's no use. I've done everything I can think of to boost the
     sensors. They're still too far out.

     LORNE
     So we have no idea what we're dealing with?

     TEYLA
     Why would they be so far out on the edge of the solar system?

     MCKAY
     I don't think it's a coincidence that this system has a space gate.
     They were probably...headed for it when they dropped out of
     hyperspace too early.

     LORNE
     Well, why would they do it?

     MCKAY
     How should I know? We don't even know who "they " are, remember?

     RONON
     Does it make a difference? Even if it was a fleet of hive ships,
     would it stop us from trying to get him back?

     LORNE

     (after a pause)
     No.

   INT--STORAGE ROOM CLOSET, ANCIENT SHIP

     LARRIN

     (whispering)
     You know, none of this would've ever happened if you would've just
     cooperated. You'd be home by now, and I'd be headed back to my
     people with a ship that could house a thousand men, women, and
     children.

     SHEPPARD
     Well if you had asked for my help in the first place instead of
     attacking me...

     LARRIN
     We couldn't risk it.

     SHEPPARD
     Risk what?

     LARRIN
     You might've said no.

   [They stare for a moment, then Sheppard glances at his scanner.]

     SHEPPARD
     They're leaving.

   [She gives him a defiant nod. He opens the door.]

   INT--STORAGE ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [He pauses before going out to the corridor.]

     SHEPPARD
     Hold up. We've got a problem. They're between us and the control
     room.

     LARRIN
     We should be able to find a way around.

     SHEPPARD
     There's not enough time. We can't risk them finding it first.

     LARRIN
     Well, it doesn't matter. It's not like they can fly the ship.

   [Sheppard winces and avoids Larrin's eyes.]

     LARRIN
     Sheppard...you did shut down the controls, right? Sheppard!

     SHEPPARD
     Look, there wasn't enough time!

     LARRIN
     If they find that control room before we do, they'll not only be
     able to fly this ship, but they're going to be able to track us
     using the internal sensors.

     SHEPPARD

     (walking around her, speaking angrily)
     Believe me, I know. And by the way, I was busy saving your life at
     the time.

     LARRIN
     The only reason my life was in danger in the first place is because
     you decided to broadcast our position to half the galaxy.

   [Sheppard clenches his fist and bites back a further retort.]

     SHEPPARD
     Do you want to argue about this, or do you want to do something
     about it?

     LARRIN
     Fine. What are the options?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, we're cut off from the control room, and we have no weapons.

     LARRIN
     That's not true. We have the chair.

     SHEPPARD
     I don't think drones are gonna do any good with a bunch of Wraith in
     the middle of the ship.

     LARRIN
     What if they weren't in the middle?

     SHEPPARD
     Get serious.

     LARRIN
     You got a better idea?

   [Sheppard grimaces.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard climbs into the room through Larrin's blast passage and sits
   in the chair.]

     SHEPPARD
     All right. I'm in position.

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Larrin carries Sheppard's scanner.]

     LARRIN
     Wait for my signal.

   [The conversation switches between Larrin's and Sheppard's locations.]

     SHEPPARD
     You sure you want to go through with this? I mean, if you don't make
     it, I'm going to feel responsible, and, well, I really don't need
     the guilt.

     LARRIN
     I'll be fine as long as you don't shoot too early. I'm sure that's
     not the first time you've heard that from a woman.

     SHEPPARD
     On the other hand, I might be able to live with it.

   [He leans back in the chair.]

     LARRIN
     I got 'em. Here we go.

   [She takes a deep breath and heads forward.]

   [In a nearby corridor, the three Wraith march, wary for anything. From
   behind them Larrin whistles. They turn and immediately give chase as
   she runs down the hall. One Wraith heads through a side passage to cut
   her off.]

   [The two remaining Wraith fire their stunners. Larrin heads to a door
   at the far end.]

     LARRIN
     Sheppard, now!

   [She reaches the door and waves over the control to open it.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard concentrates.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [A lone drone exits the ship and boomerangs back.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Larrin closes the door behind her just in time. The Wraith continue to
   fire on the door, but further down the corridor, the drone strikes the
   ship. The depressurization sucks the two Wraith out into space.]

   [Larrin sighs in relief and turns from the closed door. The third
   Wraith is waiting for her, instantly pressing his feeding hand to her
   chest. She grunts in pain and tries to pull it away. She screams.]

   INT--CHAIR ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard sits up, breathing heavily from the exertion.]

     SHEPPARD
     Larrin, come in. Larrin?

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [The Wraith pauses in his feeding. Larrin lies dying on the floor of
   the corridor. She appears much older and has a large feeding wound on
   her chest.]

     WRAITH
     And now, before I take the rest of your life, you will answer my
     questions. How many more of your people are on this ship? I do not
     have to kill you, nor do I have to leave you like this. It would be
     better if you cooperated.

   [While the Wraith speaks, Sheppard peeks around a corner watching. He
   checks the charge of the pistol he still carries.]

     WRAITH
     This is your last chance. Tell me. How many more of you are on
     board?

   [The Wraith jerks as he feels a pistol pressed against his head.]

     SHEPPARD
     It only takes one. I see that you've just fed. Which means that your
     regeneration powers are at your highest. But, I seriously doubt you
     can grow a new head.

     WRAITH
     What do you want?

     SHEPPARD
     First, you're going to hand me the stunner. Slowly.

   [The Wraith reluctantly pulls his stunner out of his holster and hands
   it over.]

     SHEPPARD
     Next, you're gonna give back what you took. Then, you're gonna
     leave.

     WRAITH
     Leave?

     SHEPPARD
     You came in a dart, right?

     WRAITH
     The bay was unguarded. We landed our darts and entered unchallenged.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, then, you're gonna leave the same way you came. There's a
     space gate orbiting the second planet in the system. It may take you
     a while, but you'll get there.

     WRAITH
     If I restore her, there's nothing to stop you from going back on
     your word and killing me anyway.

     SHEPPARD
     That's true. I'd say there's a fifty-fifty chance I'll do it out of
     pure spite. But...if you don't, I will kill you.

   [He nudges the Wraith's head with the pistol. The Wraith "un-feeds",
   restoring Larrin to health and youth. She gasps in surprise. The Wraith
   appears subdued.]

     SHEPPARD
     Get up.

   [The Wraith slowly stands.]

     SHEPPARD
     Turn around.

   [The Wraith turns around to the far passageway. Sheppard stands over
   Larrin while the Wraith walks away, pausing at the end of the corridor
   before going out of sight. Sheppard kneels by Larrin.]

     SHEPPARD
     You all right?

     LARRIN
     Uh, I don't know. That was so strange. To have your...whole life
     fading away, and then to...suddenly have it back again. It actually
     felt kind of good.

   [She smiles.]

     SHEPPARD

     (quirking a smile)
     Mmm. I know. It happened to me once too. Long story. Think you can
     get up?

     LARRIN
     Yeah.

   [He helps her up. She half collapses as she gets to her feet.]

     SHEPPARD
     Easy...

   [He continues to hold her up in an embrace. She clings to him.]

     LARRIN
     I'm okay. I'm all right. You saved my life. Again.

     SHEPPARD
     If you hadn't come up with the plan, we'd both be dead.

     LARRIN
     So are you saying we make a good team?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, don't go crazy.

     LARRIN
     Right. But in the interest of...interstellar relations, I think we
     should at least just...try to get along, right?

   [They kiss. Larrin pickpockets the Wraith stunner Sheppard confiscated
   and points it at his gut as they break apart.]

     SHEPPARD
     You've got to be kidding me.

     LARRIN
     Sorry.

   [She shoots him with the stunner. He collapses to the floor.]

   INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Larrin enters the room and goes immediately to the controls.]

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard regains consciousness with a groan.]

     SHEPPARD
     Larrin?

   [The conversation switches between Larrin's and Sheppard's locations.]

     LARRIN
     Sorry about this, Sheppard. And I really am grateful you saved my
     life.

     SHEPPARD

     (annoyed)
     Well, you've got a funny way of showing it.

     LARRIN
     Don't play hurt with me. It's easy to be generous when you think you
     have the upper hand.

     SHEPPARD
     What are you talking about?

     LARRIN
     We both know the only reason you didn't stun me and lock me up the
     first opportunity you got was because you thought your ships were
     gonna get here first. You were wrong about that, by the way.

   [Sheppard grimaces.]

   EXT--SPACE

   [Three Travelers' ships arrive out of hyperspace and flank the Ancient
   ship.]

   INT--AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP

   [A Traveler crewman appears on a video transmission appearing on a
   monitor.]

     TRAVELER CREWMAN
     Larrin, it's good to see you again.

     LARRIN
     Believe me, I feel the same way. How did you find us?

     TRAVELER CREWMAN
     Well, we were monitoring communications before you jumped into
     hyperspace.

     LARRIN
     You knew he took the ship?

     TRAVELER CREWMAN
     It...seemed fairly obvious. We guessed his priority would be to
     contact his people, so we sent probes to all the space gates in the
     vicinity of our previous position. Eventually, we detected your
     energy signature.

     LARRIN
     Well done. Now, I want you to send over a couple of technicians to
     help me get the hyperdrive back online...Oh, and a security team as
     well.

     TRAVELER CREWMAN
     Right away.

   INT--ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR

   [Sheppard shuffles to a door and tries to open it. He's locked out. He
   continues to try.]

     SHEPPARD
     Oh come on!

   [The door suddenly opens. Three guards are on the other side, all
   aiming weapons at him. Sheppard bites his lip and raises his hands in
   surrender.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY
     All right, close enough to do a full sensor sweep.

   [McKay pulls up the HUD.]

     MCKAY
     Looks like we've got four ships, one of them Lantian design,
     Aurora-class.

     LORNE
     What about the other three?

     MCKAY
     I don't recognize the configurations.

     RONON
     What about Sheppard?

     MCKAY
     Well, the logical assumption is that he's on board the ship that
     transmitted the signal.

     LORNE
     And which one is that?

     MCKAY
     Well, I have no idea.

     LORNE
     We're about to enter weapons range, Doc. Which ships do I target?

     TEYLA
     Perhaps we should attempt to communicate before we attack. We know
     nothing about these people.

     LORNE
     That's true. But right now about the only thing we've got going for
     us is the fact that we're cloaked. We send a signal, we give up our
     position.

     MCKAY
     He's right. They could target us, or-or for that matter, they could
     just jump back into hyperspace. We'd be right back at square one.

     RONON
     We didn't come all this way for nothing, right?

     MCKAY

     (resigned)
     All right-all right, well, I'll see if I can find a way to disable
     them.

   INT--CELL, ANCIENT SHIP

   [Sheppard is locked in the cell again. Larrin enters, shutting off the
   shield barrier and entering the cell.]

     LARRIN
     I thought you'd be glad to know the hyperdrive repairs are almost
     complete.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, congratulations. You got what you want.

     LARRIN
     Yes, it's true. I can fly the ship and navigate, but there are still
     dozens of systems I don't have access to. And if any of the controls
     went down, it would be a problem.

     SHEPPARD

     (unsympathetically)
     So finish the adapter. You said you can reverse-engineer the systems
     that were already initialized.

     LARRIN
     Well, yes we can, eventually...but it would go a lot faster if I
     keep you on board.

     SHEPPARD

     (furious)
     You are a piece of work, you know that?!

     LARRIN
     Look, I know you don't agree with my tactics, but I wasn't lying
     about why I need this ship. I'm doing this for my people.

   [She leaves the cell. Sheppard tries to follow, but the shield goes
   back up, trapping him inside.]

     SHEPPARD
     Look! I know you think you're helping your people, but you're wrong.

   [Larrin turns back.]

     LARRIN
     Excuse me?

     SHEPPARD
     You've been running and hiding for thousands of years. You've
     survived, good for you. but now you're starting to see diminishing
     returns. One more ship, that'll buy a little more time. but
     ultimately, it's not going to change anything. Your people are
     headed for a slow death.

     LARRIN
     What other choice do we have?

     SHEPPARD
     In case you haven't heard, you will soon enough, but the Wraith are
     under attack.

     LARRIN
     From who?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, it's a long story but the point is, they're taking heavy
     damage, and if they don't get wiped out, they're gonna be
     vulnerable. Now, you people have hyperdrives and advanced weapons,
     and god knows what else. When the time is right, that kind of
     technology can tip the balance.

     LARRIN
     Are you suggesting an alliance?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, I'm not asking you to dinner, but yeah, something like that.

     LARRIN
     After all I put you through?

     SHEPPARD
     Well, like you said, you did it for your people.

     LARRIN

     (smiling)
     I may have misjudged you after all.

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     LORNE
     All right, Doc. We're in weapons range. Whaddya got for me?

     MCKAY
     We can target the Lantian ship's engines.

     TEYLA
     What about the others?

     MCKAY
     Look, I've been going over the sensor data, but there's still too
     many unknowns. I mean, if you hit 'em in the wrong spot we could
     blow them out of the sky or the-or the drones could just bounce
     harmlessly off the shields. There's no way to know.

     LORNE
     All right, well it's still our best option. We can't risk them
     getting away.

   EXT--SPACE

   [The four ships open hyperspace windows and disappear into them.]

   INT--PUDDLE JUMPER

     MCKAY

     (devastated)
     They're...gone.

   [The team looks crushed. A alarm beeps. McKay looks down.]

     MCKAY
     I'm getting a contact. Huh. It's a jumper. One life sign.

     LORNE

     (into comm)
     Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne. Is that you?

     SHEPPARD

     (over comm)
     That's affirmative, Major.

   [The team all breath sighs of relief.]

   INT--SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER

     SHEPPARD

     (continuing into comm)
     ...It's good to hear from you.

     LORNE
     Likewise, sir. Seemed like we came pretty close to losing you there.

     SHEPPARD

     (with rueful chuckle)
     You don't know the half of it.

   EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY

   INT--ATLANTIS MESS HALL

   [Sheppard's team eats a meal together. Sheppard appears to savor every
   bite.]

     SHEPPARD
     Mmm. That's good.

     MCKAY
     Really?

     SHEPPARD
     You spend enough time with a bunch of space nomads, you really begin
     to appreciate what you have.

     TEYLA
     Well, it's difficult to imagine spending one's entire life onboard a
     ship.

     SHEPPARD
     Mmm.

     RONON
     If it was me, I'd go crazy.

   [McKay shoots him a look.]

     SHEPPARD
     They weren't exactly the most even-keeled people. I'm still not
     exactly sure why they let me go.

     TEYLA
     Well, you did offer them an alliance. That has to be worth
     something.

     RONON
     Or they figured out you'd be more trouble than you're worth.

   [He picks up his slab of meat with his fork and takes a bite out of
   it.]

     SHEPPARD

     (pointing his knife in emphasis)
     Now that is a possibility.

     MCKAY
     No, there's something you're not telling us...She was hot, wasn't
     she?

   [Sheppard studiously works at cutting his meat, not looking up.]

     SHEPPARD
     I don't know what you're talking about.

     MCKAY
     Aw, I knew it! That is so typical!

   [Ronon smiles at Sheppard.]

     SHEPPARD
     She had me beaten, Rodney. She threatened to kill me several times!
     It wasn't like we were hanging out in the spa together.

     MCKAY

     (still fuming)
     Whatever, all I know is that every time I get taken captive, it's
     the Wraith. Just once I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy
     alien.

     SHEPPARD
     Well, you may still get a chance.

     RONON
     Yeah, what do you mean?

   [Ronon takes another bite of meat.]

     SHEPPARD
     She's still out there.

   [McKay considers this. Teyla rolls her eyes. Sheppard's expression goes
   from joking to contemplative, and he shakes his head to clear his
   thoughts before continuing with his meal.]

   FADE OUT
