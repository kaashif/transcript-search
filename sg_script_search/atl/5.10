TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and McKay walk down a corridor.]
MCKAY
(petulant)
I don't know what all the fuss is about. If we do this every time
someone comes for a visit, we'd never get any work done.
SHEPPARD
We're just meeting him at the 'gate.
MCKAY
We're not just meeting him at the 'gate! I've been pulled from my
regular duties to help him with his "database research." I've got
stuff on the go, you know--important, vital projects for the-the
betterment of the human race.
SHEPPARD
Apparently there are other people doing equally important work,
Rodney, as hard as that is to believe.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay join Woolsey in front of the Stargate.]
WOOLSEY
An exciting day!
SHEPPARD
Absolutely.
MCKAY
(grumbling)
Yeah.
CHUCK
(calling from control room balcony)
He's ready to beam!
WOOLSEY
Very well.
[Daniel Jackson beams down in front of the Stargate. He is dressed in
civilian clothes and carries two bags. He wears an elated smile.]
WOOLSEY
Doctor Jackson, welcome to Atlantis.
DANIEL
(excited)
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey, it's great to be back. Colonel Sheppard.
Rodney.
[McKay grumbles unintelligibly and makes a put-upon sigh.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Woolsey leads Daniel and McKay down the hall.]
WOOLSEY
I'll have Rodney here show to your quarters. I'm sure--
DANIEL
Actually, I'd like to get started right away, if that's okay with
you, Rodney?
[McKay rolls his eyes.]
MCKAY
(unenthusiastic)
Oh, sure, sure. Whaddya got planned? An exciting exploration of
insignificant Ancient historical events?
DANIEL
No, not quite. I'm sure you're both familiar with the Ancient named
Janus?
WOOLSEY
The inventor?
DANIEL
Yes, he was their lead scientist and apparently a bit of a renegade.
MCKAY
Yeah, and I've been over all of his logs. Look, this is work we've
done already.
DANIEL
Well, I'm pretty sure I have information that could lead us to his
secret lab.
[McKay stops walking and turns to face Daniel.]
MCKAY
(dubious)
Secret lab?
DANIEL
Yes, a place where he conducted and subsequently hid a significant
portion of his unauthorized research. And if I'm correct, it's right
here...on Atlantis.
[McKay exchanges looks with Woolsey.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Daniel pours over a computer. McKay sits beside him, his head leaning
on one arm, looking bored.]
MCKAY
I've been over Janus's database entries with a fine-toothed comb. I
never saw any mention of a secret lab.
DANIEL
Janus was doing a lot of work that wasn't exactly approved by the
Ancient Council, so it's not hard to imagine he wouldn't include a
full accounting in this very public database. I mean, do you include
all of your research in your official reports?
MCKAY
Just get to the point.
DANIEL
Okay. He never talked about it in his entries, but several of
Janus's peers suspected he had a "bastion of unfettered thought and
experimentation." Or, as one of his lovers put it--
MCKAY
He had lovers?
DANIEL
"An isle of solitude within the city walls."
MCKAY
Well, that could just mean he was hard to talk to! People say things
like that about me all the time!
DANIEL
Now, none of these writers had any idea where the lab could be, but
one of his young assistants recalls a day where Janus turned a
corner down a hallway.
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Oh! "Today, I saw Janus in the hallway." There's a real page turner.
DANIEL
(ignoring McKay)
He chased after him with a question about his work, but when he
rounded the corner, Janus was gone. The hallway was a dead-end. He
had seemingly disappeared, and I think, into his secret lab.
MCKAY
(intrigued)
Well, did this assistant happen to mention...
DANIEL
...which hallway? Yes, he does.
MCKAY
Hmm. Well...
[McKay pulls the computer into his lap.]
DANIEL
(smug)
Yeah.
MCKAY
Hmm.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Woolsey walk down a corridor. Woolsey carries a duffel
bag.]
WOOLSEY
As soon as the Daedalus unloads its supplies, we'll be heading off
to meet up with Todd and one of his hives.
SHEPPARD
You really think he's going to show up, huh? And let you guys try
out Doctor Keller's gene therapy on a few of his guys?
WOOLSEY
Well, we held up our end of the deal. We let him use Teyla to take
control of an alliance of Wraith hives.
SHEPPARD
That's what I'm saying. He's got what he wants. I should go with
you, because I have a relationship with Todd--
WOOLSEY
That is precisely why I don't want you there... This mission is
basically going to be a negotiation, and Todd has, well, less
baggage with me than he does with you.
SHEPPARD
(frustrated)
Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't take the lead on this, I'm
just...
WOOLSEY
(firmly)
You're second-in-command here, Colonel.
[They stop at the foot of a staircase.]
WOOLSEY
I know my predecessors played fast and loose with many of the rules
set forth by the IOA, but protocol plainly states that in the rare
instance where I am required to leave Atlantis, you stay put. You're
in command here until I get back. Understood?
[Sheppard rolls his eyes and twitches, but nods.]
SHEPPARD
Okay.
WOOLSEY
(smiling)
Try not to blow her up while I'm gone.
[Woolsey starts up a staircase.]
SHEPPARD
No promises.
[Woolsey pauses and spins, watching Sheppard walk away.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Keller supervises an aide packing a case.]
KELLER
Yeah, I think this should be the last of it.
[The aide nods and leaves with the bag. Ronon enters.]
RONON
Hey.
KELLER
Hi! I was, uh, just leaving.
RONON
Yeah, I know. Here, let me get that.
[He grabs a bag as she reaches for it.]
KELLER
Thanks.
RONON
So you're going on this Daedalus thing?
KELLER
Yeah, Uh...
[Keller reaches for another duffle, and Ronon snatches it before she
can touch it.]
RONON
Un-uh.
KELLER
Thank you. I kinda have to. I'm the one that's gonna be
administering the treatment...if, you know, we ever get to that
point.
[They begin walking.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
RONON
Right. I think I should come with you on this.
KELLER
Really? Why?
RONON
I don't really trust these guys.
KELLER
You don't trust Todd and his Wraith? Or...the entire crew of the
Daedalus to protect me if something goes wrong?
RONON
I don't know. Both I guess.
[Keller stifles a chuckle.]
RONON
What?
KELLER
Nothing.
RONON
What?
KELLER
(laughing)
Nothing, nothing. It'd be great to have the company.
RONON
Okay.
[They see Daniel and McKay walking nearby.]
KELLER
Bye, Rodney. Wish us luck.
MCKAY
(absently)
Good luck.
(stopping short)
What do you mean "us"?
[He watches Keller and Ronon walk through another door, Ronon shooting
McKay a sly grin as he walks by. Daniel doubles back and stands over
McKay's shoulder.]
DANIEL
Rod? You wanna?
[He thumbs down the hallway and tries to lead McKay that way. McKay
distractedly follows.]
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[Daniel and McKay enter a corridor that lights up as they enter.]
DANIEL
Is that a water line up there?
MCKAY
Yeah, this section of the city flooded the first year we were here.
Anything salvageable got moved to the main tower.
DANIEL
Well, it's remote. That's promising. He wouldn't want anyone around
when he came in and out of his lab.
MCKAY
(excited)
Ooh, like the Batcave!
DANIEL
(drily)
Yes...just like the Batcave.
MCKAY
Well, I'm not picking up anything unusual...
[Daniel pauses and looks at a small rectangular opening on one of the
wall beams.]
DANIEL
Something used to be attached here.
[McKay stands by another one.]
MCKAY
Hmph. And here.
[Daniel notices one in the beam between the ones he and McKay already
indicated.]
DANIEL
And another one. Any idea what they are?
MCKAY
(unimpressed)
Looks like a run-of-the-mill sconce interface.
DANIEL
Right. Well...where are the sconces?
MCKAY
I don't know. Maybe the decorator changed his mind.
[Daniel raises his eyebrows dubiously.]
DANIEL
You said after the flood, anything worth salvaging was moved to the
main tower. Now, please tell me you kept detailed records of what
was found and where.
MCKAY
Did we keep detailed records? Who are you talking to here?
EXT--ATLANTIS
[Changing the view from the corridor off a pier up to the central
tower.]
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay and Daniel flip through camera footage of the base on a large
monitor.]
DANIEL
There! That-that's the hallway! Can you, uh, can you zoom in there?
[McKay rolls his eyes at Daniel but zooms into the part he points to on
the picture. Three light fixtures sit on the floor.]
MCKAY
There. There are your light fixtures.
DANIEL
They must've been knocked loose during the flood.
MCKAY
Possibly.
DANIEL
But you salvaged them, right?
MCKAY
They're lights that fell to the ground during a flood. It's not like
they're gonna--
DANIEL
(with tight smile)
Just...humor me, okay? I think we're on to something.
MCKAY
(sighing)
All right.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[The view changes from the tower to a building on another pier.]
INT--ATLANTIS STORAGE ROOM
[Daniel and McKay search through shelves storing all sorts of
containers.]
MCKAY
Here they are. I've got 'em.
[Daniel comes over to the case that McKay opens. The three light
fixtures are packed in foam.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[The view changes from the storage building over to the far pier and
the abandoned corridor.]
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[Daniel finishes putting in the last sconce. It makes humming tone as
it lights up. McKay looks puzzled.]
DANIEL
That's odd. Each of these three lights made a different tone when I
plugged them in. Does that...usually happen around here?
MCKAY
(slowly)
Not usually, no.
[Daniel taps each sconce. Each one plays a different tone.]
MCKAY
Well, they've been banged around a lot, underwater for a few days.
Maybe they're just broken.
DANIEL
No, it's a puzzle. I think we need to activate these in a specific
order.
MCKAY
(scoffing)
What, you mean like a three digit code? You know how easy that would
be to break? There's only six variations.
DANIEL
(impatient)
Well, maybe we need to activate them a number of times in a specific
order. I don't suppose you recognize any of these three notes?
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
What, you mean like, does it remind me of Janus's favorite Brian Eno
track? No. No such luck.
DANIEL
Well, Janus's assistant said he disappeared pretty quickly down the
hallway, so it can't be a long code. Maybe it's just as simple as
three tones in a row.
MCKAY
Go for it.
[Bored, McKay wanders further down the hall while Daniel plays with
variations of the order of the tones, waiting for something to happen.
McKay pauses at the end of the hall, pressing against the wall and
looking puzzled.]
MCKAY
Hold on for a second.
DANIEL
What is it?
MCKAY
Come here and push against this wall.
DANIEL
Why?
MCKAY
Please, just...humor me. I think I'm onto something.
[Daniel and McKay switch places.]
MCKAY
Okay, on the count of three, I want you to push against the wall as
hard as you can, okay?
DANIEL
Okay.
MCKAY
Okay, one...two...three.
[Daniel shoves against the wall. McKay taps each sconce as he walks by
left to right, each tone becoming slightly higher. Daniel falls through
the wall.]
DANIEL
(muffled)
Oof!
[He disappears from view. McKay stares at the blank wall.]
MCKAY
Son of a bitch.
[He touches the three lights again, walking steadily down the hall and
through the wall as the tones still ring.]
INT--JANUS'S LAB
[McKay walks into the darkened lab. Daniel is still lying on the floor
where he fell, looking dazed.]
DANIEL
Ow.
[McKay kneels next to Daniel.]
MCKAY
Controlled magnetic harmonic resonance.
DANIEL
What?
MCKAY
Apparently Tesla was close to something like this before Edison
trashed his lab.
[Daniel shakes his head as if to clear his vision.]
DANIEL
What are you talking about?
MCKAY
That wall was specially designed to destabilize when bombarded with
a very specific harmonic resonance. That's what the tones were! And
the strong magnetic property of the particles is what keeps the door
from just crumbling into dust. It's a great way to hide a door,
because, you know, if you're looking for a door to open, it's never
going to be found. It's like a hologram, only better because it-it's
solid mass until the tones are playing.
DANIEL
(drily)
Right, so you could've just told me to walk through the door when
you did it.
MCKAY
I could have, yes.
DANIEL
Yes, yes.
[He rolls his eyes and stands.]
DANIEL
Where the hell are we?
[Once they're both standing, the monitors and consoles in the room all
light up, illuminating many devices and control consoles.]
DANIEL
(awed)
Wow.
MCKAY
(excited)
Janus's secret lab!
[They move to one of the consoles to study it. Neither notices a small
console with a red light blinking.]
EXT--SPACE
[An icy planet floats in space.]
INT--ANCIENT LAB ON PLANET
[A red light blinks on a console filled with Ancient crystals. A few
moments later all the crystals light up, and monitors come to life near
them. An alien wearing armor and a helmet watches.]
ALIEN
Alert the others. The device has been activated.
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus flies through hyperspace.]
INT--DAEDALUS MESS HALL
[Woolsey sits at a table, going over notes. Keller grabs a water bottle
from the supply table and spots him.]
KELLER
Hey, Mr. Woolsey.
WOOLSEY
Doctor Keller.
(looking around)
Where's your burly protector? It's odd to see you without him,
nowadays.
KELLER
(smiling)
He's...in the lab. What're you working on?
WOOLSEY
A speech.
KELLER
What for?
WOOLSEY
Well, this is a...fairly momentous occasion. The Wraith will take a
step forward, not only for their own benefit, but for that of the
entire galaxy. It's an historic day. I just think it deserves
some...recognition.
KELLER
Well, what have you got so far?
WOOLSEY
"Today is an historic day..."
[He looks up and bites his lip.]
KELLER
(weakly)
It's a...good place to start.
WOOLSEY
Well, it's a work in progress.
[They exchange awkward looks and Keller leaves.]
INT--JANUS'S LAB
[Sheppard steps through the wall. The room is filled with scientists
studying the devices. Daniel studies one console and large monitor.
McKay looks up when Sheppard enters.]
SHEPPARD
Whoa. That's pretty cool.
MCKAY
Harmonic resonance.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, I was told. But what happens if the sound goes off and you're
in the middle of the...wall?
MCKAY
Well, the wall would break apart your body.
SHEPPARD
Maybe we should, uh--
MCKAY
I've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside. The wall is now
permanently open. Don't worry.
SHEPPARD
Good. So what do we got?
DANIEL
Well, the good news is it's definitely Janus's secret lab; the bad
news is getting in was the easy part.
MCKAY
There are levels of encryption on all of the data here that even the
most paranoid NSA agent wouldn't use. I mean, it is deep.
[Daniel walks over to join them. He sits beside Rodney.]
DANIEL
Some of them are straight up math ciphers while others are Ancient
knowledge puzzles.
MCKAY
And until we start deciphering, there's no way to tell what any of
this stuff does.
SHEPPARD
Sounds like you guys make a good team, though.
[Daniel looks up, disturbed, while McKay shifts uncomfortably.]
MCKAY
(noncommittally)
Mmm.
DANIEL
(drily)
Yeah.
SHEPPARD
Well, I guess I'll go back to being the boss.
MCKAY
How's that going?
SHEPPARD
Pretty boring, actually.
MCKAY
Well, you're more than welcome to help us crack this first stream
cipher.
(to Daniel)
You know, um, he could've been in Mensa.
[Daniel grins, amused, while McKay stifles a laugh. Sheppard glowers at
them.]
SHEPPARD
Why don't you contact me when you two geniuses have a breakthrough?
MCKAY
Will do.
[Sheppard leaves, walking past the small device on a podium, still
blinking the red light.]
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus exits hyperspace. Three Wraith hive ships are already
floating at the rendezvous point.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Caldwell sits in his chair. Marks is at the starboard station.]
MARKS
Sir, we're being hailed.
CALDWELL
Open a channel.
(into radio)
This is Colonel Caldwell of the Earth ship Daedalus. We're ready to
receive your delegation.
KENNY
(over radio)
The delegation is on their way.
CALDWELL
Marks, you have the bridge. I'm going to meet our guests.
[Caldwell leaves.]
EXT--SPACE
[A Wraith ship, larger than a dart but with a similar appearance flies
to the Daedalus and lands in the F-302 hanger bay.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Woolsey paces outside the F-302 bay. Ronon, Caldwell, Keller, and
Daedalus security also wait. The bay door opens. Todd and two other
Wraith enter the corridor.]
WOOLSEY
Thank you for coming.
TODD
Thank you for having us.
[Woolsey straightens and clears his throat.]
WOOLSEY
(formally)
Today is an historic day. Robert Grosseteste once said...
TODD
(interrupting)
I would like to get started as soon as possible.
WOOLSEY
Yes, of course. But I wanted to recognize--
TODD
I have my doubts that your plan will be effective. So shall we drop
these unfounded pleasantries and get to work?
[There is a pregnant silence.]
WOOLSEY
Very well. Doctor Keller, lead the way.
[Keller nods.]
KELLER
Please come with me.
[Keller leads the Wraith delegation down the hall. Some of the security
and Ronon follow. Guards stand by the door as Caldwell fights a smile
and looks to Woolsey.]
CALDWELL
Robert who?
WOOLSEY
(annoyed)
Never mind.
[Woolsey walks away. Caldwell smiles.]
EXT--ATLANTIS NIGHT
INT--JANUS'S LAB
[Daniel and McKay continue to study information on the displays. They
are the only two left in the room. McKay yawns.]
DANIEL
You know, it's almost dawn. If you want to call it a night, it's
uh...
[He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.]
MCKAY
What? No, no, no. I'm fine. Fine. But, you know, if you need to
rest, I'll completely understand.
[He sniffs and fights to look alert. Daniel becomes alert and puts his
glasses back on.]
DANIEL
Seriously? I-i-is everything a competition with you?
MCKAY
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
DANIEL
(incredulous)
I-I just found you a secret lab full of really cool Ancient stuff. I
kind of thing that should score me some points here!
MCKAY
Okay, I will admit that I may have been a little brusque with you up
until now.
DANIEL
Just a little.
MCKAY
But the truth is, I really didn't think you were going to find
anything!
DANIEL
Well, that much I actually understand.
MCKAY
You do?
DANIEL
Yeah. I've...spent the majority of my professional life being
ridiculed for my theories--most of which turned out to be correct,
by the way. I'm kinda used to it, Rodney.
[McKay slumps back in his chair and sighs.]
MCKAY
Doesn't that bother you? I mean, no vindication, no recognition,
no...credit?
DANIEL
Well, I could say the same thing about you. The discoveries you've
made, you...probably could've won the Nobel Prize five times over by
now.
MCKAY
(relaxing)
Too true. So, I guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?
DANIEL
(deadpan)
No, we did it for the money.
[Daniel grins. McKay snickers.]
MCKAY
Good one.
(sobering)
Wait a minute--you don't get paid more than I do, do you?
[Daniel blinks, rolls his eyes at McKay, and sighs.]
MCKAY
Do you?
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, NIGHT
[An alien ship drops out of hyperspace close to the ocean's surface and
flies over the waves.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Chuck sits with his feet propped, reading a book, "The Martian
General's Daughter" by Theodore Judson. He notices an alert on his
console and drops the book.]
CHUCK
Hyperspace window just opened!
BANKS
Daedalus isn't due back yet.
[She comes over to his display. It shows an unrecognized IFF.]
BANKS
Get Sheppard.
INT--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS
[Sheppard sleeps in his bed, fully dressed and on top of the covers, an
open book on his stomach.]
CHUCK
(over intercom)
Colonel Sheppard, sir?
[Sheppard jolts awake.]
SHEPPARD
(groggily)
Yeah, uh, I'm just resting my eyes.
[He looks around the empty room.]
SHEPPARD
(more alert)
Who said that?
CHUCK
(over intercom)
I patched into the P.A. in your room, sir. You're going to want to
get up here.
[Sheppard puts the book down and gets up.]
EXT--ATLANTIS OCEAN, NIGHT
[The alien ship continues to fly low. Landing struts pull out as the
ship nears the city of Atlantis.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard rushes in. Everyone is watching Chuck's station, alert.]
SHEPPARD
What's going on?
BANKS
We're tracking a small ship in atmosphere. It's coming right for us.
SHEPPARD
Get the jumpers in the air.
BANKS
It's closing fast, sir. It'll be here in less than ten seconds.
[A display shows the bogey closing on the city.]
SHEPPARD
Shields up. I still want the jumpers ready.
[Chuck complies.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The shield forms and surrounds the city.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
BANKS
Here it comes.
[They watch the display as the alien ship reaches Atlantis through the
shield and then moves into the city over one of the far piers.]
BANKS
That's impossible.
SHEPPARD
Well, wh-what did it just do?
CHUCK
It passed through the shield.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, but how did it do that?
BANKS
(worried)
I'm not sure, sir...Ancient ships can do it.
[They watch as the ship remains hovering at the pier section.]
SHEPPARD
All right, tell Teyla and a team of marines to meet me at that pier.
[Banks moves to her computer.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The alien ship hovers over the pier, sitting within the shields of
Atlantis. At the bow of the ship, a circular opening forms on the lower
side. Three aliens drop in free-fall from the ship, then use small
thrusters on their boots to slow and land on an upper balcony to one of
the buildings.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Three aliens, all in the heavy armor and helmets, walk determinedly
through the corridor. Each has a large metal plate strapped to its
back.]
INT--ANOTHER ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard comes out of a transporter running and holding a rifle. Teyla
and a squad of marines come running from another corridor to join him.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
BANKS
(nervous)
They should be right in front of you.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[The aliens take the metal plates off their backs and attach them to
each other on the floor, forming a large disc. They attach a small
round device to its center and twist the control. The disc lights up
and makes a humming noise. The aliens step onto it as Sheppard's team
arrives.]
SHEPPARD
Don't move!
[One of the aliens touches a control on its breastplate. A domed shield
comes up from the disc, protecting the aliens as Sheppard's team opens
fire. The shielded disc drops through the floor, leaving a large hole
in its place.]
[Sheppard's team stops firing and approaches the hole. The disk has
moved down at least six floors and is continuing its descent. Some
Atlantis expedition members can be seen in other floors looking through
the holes on their floors in puzzlement.]
SHEPPARD
What's at the bottom of this tower?
[Teyla looks at him, clearly worried.]
TEYLA
(tightly)
Rodney.
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[The aliens reach the bottom floor and the corridor outside Janus's
laboratory. Two march towards the far wall. One remains behind,
guarding the disc and watching for resistance.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard, Teyla and the marines race to a transporter.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Rodney, this is Sheppard! Come in!
INT--JANUS'S LAB
[Daniel and McKay continue to work on the consoles in an unhurried
manner.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Rodney!
MCKAY
(into radio, unconcerned)
What's up?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, OUTSIDE TRANSPORTER
[The team pile into the transporter.]
SHEPPARD
Get out of there, right now!
INT--JANUS'S LAB
MCKAY
(into radio, worried)
Why?
[He and Daniel both stand, alert and concerned at Sheppard's tone, as
the two aliens walk through the wall-door. The aliens stun them both
with an energy weapon. One alien grabs the device with the red blinking
light off the table. They ignore the other equipment.]
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[Sheppard's team arrives. The alien punches a button on its arm and a
yellow force field appears. He holds his arm as if grasping a shield
while Sheppard's team fires. The bullets don't get through, but the
alien appears to be struggling to hold his ground. The two aliens
return from Janus's lab. One carries the device. The other drags the
unconscious bodies of McKay and Daniel behind him, holding each of them
by one arm.]
[While the third alien continues to block the gunfire with the shield,
the other two step onto the disc, the one holding Daniel and McKay by
their collars, lifting the limp bodies so they're upright. The dome
shield encompasses the two aliens and their booty. It levitates up
through the hole in the ceiling, leaving their compatriot to fall as
the force field fails and the alien is hit by multiple bullet wounds.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[The domed disc flies up through the tower levels straight into the sky
and into the waiting opening of the alien ship. The ship closes its
door and immediately flies off, flying across the city and through the
shield without difficulty. It jumps into hyperspace while still in the
planet's atmosphere.]
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[Sheppard's team warily approach the downed alien and look up through
the hole.]
SHEPPARD
(keying radio)
Control room, what's the status of that ship?
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
BANKS
I'm sorry, Colonel. They're gone.
[They stare at the monitor displaying "contact lost".]
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Teyla look very worried.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAWN
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[Zelenka and a science team joins Sheppard's team.]
ZELENKA
Is it alive?
SHEPPARD
You tell me.
[Zelenka runs his scanner over the alien.]
ZELENKA
No. I'm not getting any coherent readings. Perhaps we should put it
under a medical scanner.
SHEPPARD
Okay. Do it.
ZELENKA
(to scientist)
Go get a gurney.
[The scientist hurries away. Zelenka looks up at the circular hole in
the ceiling and purses his lips.]
ZELENKA
So is it true they took Rodney and Doctor Jackson?
[Teyla looks away, upset. Sheppard tightly nods.]
SHEPPARD
(quietly)
Yeah.
INT--ALIEN PRISON CELL
[Daniel lightly taps McKay's cheek several times. McKay lies on the
floor with Daniel crouched over him.]
MCKAY
Oh. Ow. What the hell happened?
[Daniel helps McKay to his feet, patting him on the back. They are both
trapped in a dark room. The cell is made up of several green laser
beams horizontally running in a triangle shape.]
DANIEL
We were attacked!
MCKAY
That much I got. Thanks. By who?
DANIEL
I was kinda hoping you could tell me.
MCKAY
Okay, there is no way this is a coincidence. I mean, we discover
Janus's super-secret lab, and less than twenty-four hours later, a
bunch of aliens show up all guns blazing? Don't you think that's a
little odd?
DANIEL
(slowly)
Now that you mention it...
[He shrugs in agreement.]
INT--ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR
[The scientist team wheels the alien away. Zelenka remains with
Sheppard and Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
They knew exactly what they were looking for. They didn't waste any
time, went straight for the lab.
TEYLA
When they came out, one of them was carrying a device.
INT--JANUS'S LAB
[The trio enter the lab.]
ZELENKA
Unfortunately, we haven't had nearly enough time to go through
everything we found in here, so there's no way of knowing exactly
what they took.
SHEPPARD
All this stuff came on when Rodney and Doctor Jackson came in here?
ZELENKA
Yeah, pretty much. It probably activated in response to Rodney's ATA
gene. Why?
SHEPPARD
What if something in here's been broadcasting?
INT--ALIEN PRISON CELL
MCKAY
A subspace signal. It's the only possible answer.
DANIEL
What are you talking about?
MCKAY
We've come across them before. They're a-a real-time practically
instantaneous link between two Ancient devices. They can be
separated by like, half a galaxy.
INT--JANUS'S LAB
SHEPPARD
There's a bunch of aliens out there. They-they stumble upon an
Ancient lab, probably built by Janus himself. It's dormant. It's not
working. Then one day, out of the blue, it...activates.
INT--ALIEN PRISON CELL
MCKAY
So they're standing around, they're scratching their heads, they
have no idea what's going on. Then they discover the subspace link.
INT--JANUS'S LAB
SHEPPARD
They decide to follow it. They trace it back to us.
ZELENKA
(dubious)
And then attack us and take two of our people hostage?
TEYLA
Rodney and Doctor Jackson were not the targets.
SHEPPARD
They were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Whatever that
device was, that's what they were after.
INT--ALIEN PRISON CELL
DANIEL
All right, good theory. So what do we do?
MCKAY
Well, we-we gotta get out of here.
[McKay starts looking at the laser beams.]
DANIEL
We're probably on a ship traveling through hyperspace, where are we
gonna go?
MCKAY
I'll think of something.
DANIEL
Really?
MCKAY
Yep. Always do.
[McKay reaches out and touches one of the beams. It zaps his finger
with a violent hum.]
MCKAY
Ow!
DANIEL
Oh yeah, I tried that. They, uh, zap you when you touch them.
MCKAY
(annoyed)
You could have told me that before I touched it!
DANIEL
(blandly)
I could have. Yes.
[McKay glowers at Daniel.]
DANIEL
Look, they stripped us of everything but the clothing on our backs
and surrounded us with laser walls. I'm not sure how much play we
have here.
MCKAY
We've got one thing going for us at least.
DANIEL
What's that?
MCKAY
We're not dead yet.
DANIEL
Good point.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Zelenka operates the Ancient scanner as the alien lies on the bed
below. Teyla and Sheppard stand nearby.]
ZELENKA
(sighing)
It's no good. I'm still not getting any useful readings. The suit is
emitting some sort of E.M. field that's disrupting the scanner.
I...have no idea how to shut it off.
SHEPPARD
There's no way to penetrate the shell and see what's under there?
TEYLA
Do you think there's a human underneath all that armor?
SHEPPARD
Impossible to say. It could be a robot.
ZELENKA
One thing's for sure--it's not like anything we've ever seen before.
TEYLA
Well, Doctor Weir did say that there were other technologically
advanced societies that we have yet to encounter.
SHEPPARD
We've just made first contact.
ZELENKA
What do you want me to do?
[Sheppard steps over to look at the alien.]
SHEPPARD
Cut it open.
[Later, Zelenka uses a power-saw to try to slice open the breastplate.
Another scientist, wearing goggles like Zelenka, holds the alien's head
in place. Sheppard and Teyla stand nearby. The saw whirs with a higher
and higher pitched whine. Zelenka finally shuts it down and lifts his
goggles to study the saw.]
ZELENKA
Ach! It's no good. I just dulled out the blade!
[Sheppard bites his lip and studies the alien.]
SHEPPARD
The neck.
ZELENKA
What?
SHEPPARD
It looks like the softest part. Try the neck.
[Zelenka backs off.]
ZELENKA
(stammering)
But...
TEYLA
It's already dead, Radek.
ZELENKA
We think.
SHEPPARD
Just do it.
[He re-dons his goggles and takes his re-bladed saw back from his aide.
The aide holds the head while Zelenka starts sawing at the neck.]
ZELENKA
It's working!
[Zelenka notices a small light blinking on the breastplate. He stops
his saw. There is a beeping with the blinking.]
ZELENKA
Uh-oh...
SHEPPARD
Get out. Everyone. Get out!
[Everyone runs out of the room, taking cover in the corridor outside
just before the alien self-destructs in a fiery explosion.]
SHEPPARD
Everyone okay?
TEYLA
Yes.
SHEPPARD
Somebody really wants to keep secret whatever's inside that suit.
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus floats in space.]
INT--DAEDALUS SCIENCE LAB
[Todd paces while Keller works on her computer.]
KELLER
(nervously)
We've run close to a hundred simulations based on full medical scans
of the Wraith we've had in...captivity. They've all been successful.
TODD
We both know very well that computer simulations and live trials are
very different.
KELLER
I don't think we're doing this cavalierly. I-I stand by the data. It
will work.
TODD
Uh-uh. Perhaps it will.
[Keller pauses and steels herself.]
KELLER
The question is, do you want it to?
[Todd approaches her.]
TODD
(considering)
Mmm. I do see the benefits...even if we only use the therapy on some
of my troops, say those whose lives, thanks to this war, are
expected to be short. Why waste perfectly good resources on them,
yes?
[Keller can't meet Todd's gaze.]
TODD
But it will be very difficult for me to ask those around me to give
themselves over for the good of the human race.
KELLER
But, it's for your benefit, too. If you don't have to rely on human
feeding, the war would be over.
TODD
Perhaps...but then what would we do? Who would we be?
[Keller looks at him compassionately. Todd stalks away.]
EXT--SPACE
[The alien ship jumps out of hyperspace just above the atmosphere of
the planet with the Ancient lab. It flies down to the surface.]
EXT--ANCIENT LAB FACILITY
[The ship flies through a snow storm to land next to the facility,
which is half-covered in snow.]
INT--ALIEN SHIP CORRIDOR
[One alien walks down the corridor, carrying the Ancient device from
Janus's lab. Two other aliens manhandle Daniel and McKay down the hall
behind the first.]
DANIEL
Can we talk to somebody in charge? I think there's been a bit of a
misunderstanding. There's no need to treat us this way.
[The alien tightens its grip on Daniel's collar. He shuts up and
grimaces.]
MCKAY
(whimpering in pain)
Oh. Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.
INT--ANCIENT LAB
[Daniel and McKay are pushed into the lab and released. The first alien
places the device on a console, where everything lights up.]
ALIEN
Get the device operational.
MCKAY
We don't even know what it is!
[The alien stalks out, ignoring McKay. The door clangs shut.]
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Oh, great. It's sealed shut, and they've removed the door control
from this side.
[Daniel steps onto one of the two main consoles.]
DANIEL
Where the hell are we?
MCKAY
I'd say judging by the Lantian architecture, I'd guess, you know,
secret Janus facility? Which is, you know, probably bad for us,
because it probably means it's hard to find.
[Daniel steps from one console to the other.]
DANIEL
(resigned)
So I guess that means no rescue any time soon.
[McKay looks at the device the alien left on the console.]
MCKAY
Does that look familiar to you?
DANIEL
Yeah, it's the device from the Atlantis lab.
MCKAY
At least we know why they brought us with them.
DANIEL
Yeah, they need us to get the device operational. I got that.
MCKAY
Right. And I don't get think we're gonna get any more info from
Talky McSays-a-Lot out there, so, uh, fire up these consoles. See
what we're dealing with.
[Daniel reaches for a control.]
MCKAY
(abruptly)
Not like that.
[Daniel pulls his hand back. McKay studies the controls.]
MCKAY
Um...let's see. Yeah. Like that.
[McKay reaches past Daniel and flips the control Daniel was first going
to touch. He then reaches down to the controls directly in front of
Daniel.]
MCKAY
And then I need to be right there. Yeah.
[Daniel stands exasperated, and resigned.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Banks and Sheppard walk up the steps from the Gate Room to the Control
Room.]
BANKS
We've got five jumpers in the air, flying a defensive formation
around the city, and have the chair fired up and ready for you at a
moment's notice.
SHEPPARD
I want marine details every five levels, locked and loaded, ready
for my go ahead, just in case.
BANKS
Absolutely.
[Banks parts ways with Sheppard who joins Zelenka at his console.]
ZELENKA
Colonel, I think I may have something. I've been working under the
assumption that, as you suggested, the device they took must have
been broadcasting some sort of subspace communication.
SHEPPARD
You can trace it?
ZELENKA
Well, yeah, if it was broadcasting from Atlantis, yes. But obviously
it's not doing that anymore.
SHEPPARD
So...?
ZELENKA
So...well, I'm using the work of Lazlo Babai as a stepping stone.
You know, combinatorics and um...no offense, but the math I'm using
is so complicated I don't know if I can dumb it down enough for it
to make sense.
SHEPPARD
(threateningly)
Try.
ZELENKA
(gulping)
All right, well, okay, I-I've been going over our recorded subspace
logs, and I'm trying to extrapolate the single thread that will lead
us to the area of space associated with the device.
SHEPPARD
Well, I understand that.
ZELENKA
Yes. It doesn't accurately represent what I'm doing, but...
[He shrugs.]
SHEPPARD
(impatient)
I get it. What you're doing is difficult. Just...tell me when you
get a hit.
[Sheppard walks away. Zelenka sighs and gets back to work.]
INT--ANCIENT LAB
[McKay bites his thumb and looks through a window at a device in a
shielded chamber. He steps back to the console. Daniel is at the other
console.]
DANIEL
This facility is tapped into some pretty serious power generation.
I've never seen anything like it before.
MCKAY
(half to himself)
You'd need a lot of power...
DANIEL
What?
MCKAY
I think I know what this thing does.
DANIEL
What?
MCKAY
It's an endgame machine.
DANIEL
(cautiously)
How so?
MCKAY
If it works the way I think it does, it would mean the end of the
Wraith once and for all!
[Daniel stares at McKay in shock.]
DANIEL
So, how do you destroy the Wraith once and for all?
MCKAY
Well, I never said "destroy", I mean...it would lead to that, I
suppose. But...this device would stop them dead in their tracks.
DANIEL
How?
[McKay walks over to Daniel's console.]
MCKAY
It creates a very specific subspace static. Uh, turbulence is
probably a better way of looking at it.
DANIEL
Which...?
MCKAY
Okay, look. Um, although they're all based on a fairly similar
technological premise, each race has a slightly different type of
hyperdrive. Ours are based on the Asgard drives with their own
little twist. The Ancients had their own particular system. And the
Wraith, again, have their own separate hyperdrive technology.
DANIEL
All right.
MCKAY
Okay, so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great
distances by entering and exiting subspace.
DANIEL
(impatient)
Okay. This much I already know. Yes.
[McKay and Daniel walk back to the other console.]
MCKAY
Okay, so if this machine is capable of actually functioning safely,
it disrupts the very specific subspace frequencies the Wraith use.
DANIEL
So they wouldn't be able to engage their hyperdrive.
MCKAY
Well that's the genius. They would be able to engage their
hyperdrive. It's just that their particular channel of subspace
would be destabilized, and the ship would be ripped into a million
pieces.
DANIEL
When this device is turned on, every time a Wraith ship enters
hyperspace, it self-destructs?
MCKAY
Yeah.
DANIEL
That's a pretty effective idea.
MCKAY
Yeah. I mean, because, even if word got back to the other Wraith
that the ships should stop using their hyperdrives, they'd be stuck
where they were. They'd only be able to travel using sub-light
engines.
DANIEL
Because an Ancient ship's hyperdrive operates on a different
frequency of subspace, the Ancients could fly around the galaxy and
pick them off one by one.
MCKAY
Yeah, or just...leave them to die in the vastness of space.
DANIEL
So, what's the catch?
[McKay turns back to the other console. Daniel follows him.]
MCKAY
Ah, well, the catch is that Janus ran a three-day test about...ten
thousand years ago and then, shut the whole project down because of
"unforeseen side effects."
DANIEL
Right. Which were...?
[McKay pulls up a screen on the Ancient lab monitor.]
MCKAY
Well, it-it's not clear. But, that's the key to the whole shebang.
[He points to the device the aliens took from Janus's lab.]
MCKAY
I mean, Janus brought that back with him to Atlantis but kept it
connected to the main system here. One won't work without the other.
DANIEL
Well, they seem pretty convinced we can make it operational.
MCKAY
That's because we probably can. I mean, we have everything we need
here. The question is, whether we should. The last time I went down
this road, I...I kinda destroyed a solar system.
DANIEL
Yeah, and I'm not too keen about experiencing those "unforeseen side
effects."
MCKAY
So, what do we do?
DANIEL
It's simple. We, uh...we...reason with them.
MCKAY
(deflating)
Oh.
[Later, the alien stands listening to Daniel. McKay looks uncertain at
this tactic.]
DANIEL
Now, obviously you're excited over the possibility of ending the
Wraith's reign over this galaxy once and for all. But, uh, the
reality is, this device and this facility were abandoned by their
creator for very good reasons. See, uh, it doesn't work...at least,
not safely. That's from what my friend can tell.
[McKay waves weakly. The alien doesn't respond.]
DANIEL
Look, we share the same goal. Perhaps we have many things in common.
[The alien still does not answer. Daniel looks to McKay then back.]
DANIEL
Look, given the right amount of time it's possible we could get the
device to function safely, but, uh, we'd have to contact our people
and bring in a much larger science team. See, I'm-I'm-I'm not that
kind of scientist, and, and what my friend here--
[Daniel points to McKay but the alien interrupts, turning to McKay.]
ALIEN
Get the device operational within one hour, or I will kill him. Do
you understand?
MCKAY
(meekly)
I understand, yes.
[The alien leaves.]
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
Great plan, Danny! Great plan!
[McKay moves to one of the consoles. Daniel remains in place, putting
his hands in his pockets and musing.]
DANIEL
Why the suits?
MCKAY
Huh?
DANIEL
Well, they're not in battle anymore. Originally I thought it was
just their version of SWAT gear, but...they still have it on. Maybe
they're more than just armor; maybe they're some sort of protective
suit. Maybe they can't function in our livable atmosphere.
MCKAY
(impatient)
Maybe we should just add it to the list of things that have nothing
to do with the task at hand.
DANIEL
Those suits might be the key to figuring out who these guys really
are.
MCKAY
(petulant)
Well, you work on understanding them, I'll work on trying not to get
us killed.
[McKay works at a console. Daniel stays deep in thought.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard enters.]
SHEPPARD
Well, you got something for me?
ZELENKA
Yes. M6H-987. That's my best guess.
SHEPPARD
Are you sure?
ZELENKA
Well, about 80% sure.
SHEPPARD
All right. Well, it's our only lead. It'll have to do. Doesn't
happen to have a 'gate on it, does it?
ZELENKA
No.
SHEPPARD
Of course not. Daedalus still out of communications range?
ZELENKA
Yeah, I'm afraid so. And the rendezvous point with Todd isn't even
near a Stargate.
SHEPPARD
I need to get to the jumper bay. Boost its subspace communications
range as much as you can.
ZELENKA
What are you planning?
SHEPPARD
Well, we've got to get to that planet as soon as possible. We're
gonna gate as near as we can to the Daedalus with a jumper. Have
them pick us up en route to the planet.
ZELENKA
Okay. Give me half an hour.
[He starts typing. Sheppard heads out.]
SHEPPARD
I'm going to get the team ready.
INT--ANCIENT LAB
[McKay and Daniel look into the shielded chamber.]
MCKAY
That main chamber houses the subspace antenna.
DANIEL
It harnesses the static into subspace.
MCKAY
Well, it will once I light it up.
DANIEL
(surprised)
What? You're already ready?
[McKay walks back to the consoles. Daniel follows.]
MCKAY
Well, it wasn't broken! He just shut it down. All you need is that,
(points to device)
...a basic understanding of Janus's coding style, and, uh, here's
where I come in again, the Ancient gene. I mean, we're-we're ready
to roll.
DANIEL
Rodney, you don't have to do this.
MCKAY
What?
DANIEL
Look, if-if turning this thing on means a-a solar system is gonna
explode, then let's...not.
MCKAY
They're going to kill you! We don't have a choice.
DANIEL
Yes, we do.
MCKAY
Okay, so I do nothing, they come in here, they kill you. Who gets
killed next, huh? Me. To tell you the truth here, I'm quite fond of
me. So we might as well do it, you know, now, while you're still
alive as opposed to as opposed to, you know, then.
[Daniel rolls his eyes and shrugs, resigned.]
DANIEL
All right.
MCKAY
All right.
[McKay powers up the device.]
INT--ANCIENT SHIELDED CHAMBER
[The machine powers up. Lightning arcs spark around the room and the
large machine glows with a blue light.]
INT--ANCIENT LAB
[McKay and Daniel turn and watch the light show through the small
window.]
MCKAY
(weakly)
We still alive?
DANIEL
(quietly)
I think so. I'd hate to think heaven looks like this.
MCKAY
Who says we went to heaven?
[Daniel raises his eyebrows in consideration. McKay whimpers. They both
step towards the console closer to the shield door.]
MCKAY
It's operational.
DANIEL
Anything out of the ordinary?
MCKAY
(chuckling, pleased)
No. Everything's in the green. I mean, it's working great.
DANIEL
What about those "unforeseen side effects"?
MCKAY
They're still unforeseen. For now, it's working, and we're still
alive.
DANIEL
Okay, so, what now?
MCKAY
(hopefully)
Uh, maybe, uh, a nice pat on the back, and an all-expense paid trip
back to Atlantis?
[Daniel raises his eyebrows and shoots McKay a skeptical look.]
MCKAY
(deflating)
Mmm.
EXT--SPACE
[Daedalus floats in space.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Todd walks into the bridge escorted by two guards. Woolsey is there to
meet him and hands him an earpiece.]
WOOLSEY
You have an urgent message from your hive. I assumed you'd want to
take it privately.
[Todd takes the earpiece warily and steps forward from the bridge
crew.]
TODD
(into radio)
Go ahead...Very well...Permission granted...I shall remain here.
CALDWELL
Is everything okay?
TODD
(grunting)
One of our facilities is under attack by a rival hive. Our two
support ships must depart for battle. My hive will remain here,
continue the work with Doctor Keller.
WOOLSEY
(smiling)
I'm glad to hear that.
[Todd and Caldwell both stare at Woolsey, incredulous.]
WOOLSEY
Oh! Not the under attack part. That's unfortunate, of course. I just
meant...never mind.
[Todd turns to look out the forward viewscreen.]
EXT--SPACE
[Two hive ships break formation at the rendezvous and open a hyperspace
window. As they try to enter hyperspace, they blast apart into dust.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
CALDWELL
(alarmed)
Marks, what the hell just happened?
TODD
(horrified)
How did you do that?
WOOLSEY
How did we...?! Surely, you don't think we had anything to do with
that--
TODD
You tricked me.
[He slowly turns, unobtrusively releasing a small bar from each
sleeve.]
WOOLSEY
What?
TODD
This was your plan all along. Somehow, you've found the Attero
device!
WOOLSEY
The what? We have no idea what you're--
[Todd connects the two activated bars. They emit a blast wave that
stuns everyone on the bridge into unconsciousness. Todd steps to the
commander's chair and activates the communicator.]
[The conversation switches between Todd's bridge, where his second in
command, Kenny stands, and Todd on video screen at the Daedalus
bridge.]
KENNY
Commander. We've been trying to contact you. The other cruisers were
destroyed.
TODD
I know. We've been betrayed.
KENNY
What should we do?
TODD
I have control of the humans' transport system. I will begin beaming
in our troops immediately.
[He sits down in the command chair.]
TODD
We're taking this ship.
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Ronon walks casually down a corridor. As he turns a corner, he sees
several Wraith soldiers beam onto the ship. None face him. Ronon draws
his gun and backs into an alcove, watching them march away. He heads
down another corridor.]
INT--DAEDALUS SCIENCE LAB
[Keller works on her computer. Ronon backs into the room and hurries to
her.]
RONON
Come on.
KELLER
(blankly)
What's going on?
RONON
We're under attack. We gotta get you to the armory and get you a
gun. Come on.
[He drags her away. The computer monitor beeps that the experiment is
complete.]
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[The unconscious Marks is dragged off of his seat by a Wraith. The rest
of the bridge crew is laid out in the back area by the star chart.
Wraith study the systems at various consoles while Todd activates the
lockout protocol.]
INT--DAEDALUS CORRIDOR
[Ronon and Keller race down a corridor. The armory door seals shut just
before Ronon reaches it.]
RONON
Augh! Locked!
[Keller turns to find the door sealing behind them.]
KELLER
Ronon!
[She frantically punches the key code next to the door, but it
continues to lock her out. She turns back to Ronon and shakes her
head.]
KELLER
We're locked in.
INT--DAEDALUS BRIDGE
[Todd finishes typing the lockout protocols.]
TODD
That should limit their movements. Continue beaming in our troops.
[He sits in the commander's chair as Wraith man the bridge stations.]
INT--ANCIENT LAB
[Daniel claps his hands and wanders over to McKay's console.]
DANIEL
Ten minutes and counting. Still no problem.
[McKay stares at the schematic diagram on the monitor and looks
concerned.]
MCKAY
Oh boy...
DANIEL
(worried)
What? What is it?
MCKAY
I think I just found a log entry that tells us what the side effect
is.
DANIEL
It's not...harmful radiation, is it?
[Daniel steps back from the console and clutches his hand.]
MCKAY
No. No, no, no. You and I are safe. It's the rest of the galaxy
that's gonna have problems, including...Atlantis. I've got to shut
this thing down.
[He starts frantically working the controls. The door opens and two
aliens enter, aiming their weapons at McKay.]
ALIEN
Step away from the device.
[McKay continues to work the controls. One alien shoots him and he
slumps to the floor. Daniel raises his hand in surrender.]
DANIEL
Okay. Wait-wait-wait-wait! Look, there's a very dangerous, very
serious problem with the device. Now, we need to talk to your boss--
[The other alien shoots Daniel, and he collapses unconscious.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Zelenka does a final check of the jumper crystals as Sheppard, Teyla,
and a team of marines enter the jumper.]
ZELENKA
Okay. All set. So, I'll have Chuck dial M5R-179. You should be able
to contact the Daedalus via subspace once you get there.
SHEPPARD
Nice work.
ZELENKA
Thanks. Good luck.
SHEPPARD
Thanks. We're gonna need it.
[Zelenka leaves as everyone else takes their seats.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Chuck is at his station. Zelenka comes down the staircase from the
jumper bay.]
ZELENKA
All right. Dial it up.
[Chuck nods and dials the Stargate. The Stargate activates. There is an
alarm buzzing Zelenka notices as he stares at his computer.]
ZELENKA
(puzzled)
What's that? You see that?
CHUCK
We've got a power spike at the event horizon.
ZELENKA
What? Power is building within the 'gate?! No, no, no, no. See,
that-that can't happen.
(into radio)
Colonel, do not lower the jumper into the Gate Room.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Why not?
ZELENKA
Well, for some reason, there is an unprecedented power buildup
within the 'gate.
[The conversation switches from the control room to the jumper.]
TEYLA
Power build up from where?
ZELENKA
It's coming from within the event horizon. Oh no. This is very, very
bad for us.
SHEPPARD
Just shut it down. It's probably a faulty 'gate at the other end.
ZELENKA
I-I-I'm trying. It won't let me!
[He turns to Chuck, who shakes his head negatively.]
SHEPPARD
All right, I'm coming down.
[Every gets up and follows Sheppard out of the jumper. They clamber
down the stairs.]
SHEPPARD
What do we do? Wait thirty-eight minutes and ride the puddle out?
ZELENKA
I wish. If the power continues to build like this, the 'gate will
reach critical overload and most certainly explode.
SHEPPARD
Explode?
ZELENKA
Yes. I told you it was very, very bad for us.
SHEPPARD
How does something like this happen?
ZELENKA
I don't know. It's never happened before.
SHEPPARD
How long do we have?
ZELENKA
Not very long at all. About ninety seconds.
TEYLA
Ninety seconds?!
BANKS
I would say closer to sixty.
SHEPPARD
We've got to evacuate everyone in the tower!
ZELENKA
The 'gate exploding is the equivalent of a dozen nuclear explosions.
There-there's nowhere we could evacuate quickly enough to a safe
distance.
SHEPPARD
The-the-the shield!
ZELENKA
What?
SHEPPARD
Collapse the city's shield around the 'gate. We can contain the
explosion!
ZELENKA
Yes, yes! That just might work!
[He rolls to another console and starts typing.]
CHUCK
The 'gate will reach a critical limit in five...four...three...
[The shield starts forming around the Stargate.]
CHUCK
...two...
[The shield makes a complete dome around the Stargate.]
CHUCK
...one...
[The Stargate explodes, contained in the shield. It creates a bright
light like a small sun in the gate room. Everyone shields their eyes.]
ZELENKA
Don't look at the blast!
SHEPPARD
(caustic)
Might have mentioned that before!
ZELENKA
I'll see if I can divert more power to the shield. See if I can
block more of the radiation.
[The light lessens, but the blast is still powerful, undulating within
the limits of the shield. Sheppard and Teyla look at the area and walk
towards the balcony.]
SHEPPARD
And now what?
ZELENKA
The shield continues to diffuse the energy of the blast. Every
second it is contained within the shield, the explosion gets weaker.
SHEPPARD
How long does it take?
[Zelenka's computer beeps.]
ZELENKA
Oh, no.
SHEPPARD
(stepping back towards Zelenka)
What?
ZELENKA
The shield needs at least another minute to contain the full brunt
of the blast, but we're frying out the emitters. I don't know how
much longer I can hold this.
SHEPPARD
Shut down the city! Transfer all the power!
ZELENKA
Yes, I'm trying.
[Zelenka types on his laptop.]
SHEPPARD
(shouting)
Everyone who doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city!
Move! Everybody!
[The gate room personnel quickly evacuate. Sheppard points to Teyla.]
SHEPPARD
You're gonna want to get out of here.
TEYLA
John, I...
SHEPPARD
(sharply)
Teyla, please.
[With a torn expression, Teyla complies. Only Zelenka and Sheppard are
left.]
SHEPPARD
Come on. You can do it, Radek.
[He looks to the explosion. The bright yellow has dulled to a darker
orange for the most part.]
SHEPPARD
(encouraged)
It's going down. We're going to make it.
ZELENKA
(shaking his head)
No. It's not enough.
[Sheppard stares at Zelenka's screen.]
EXT--ATLANTIS TOWER, DAY
[The bright shielded explosion is visible from all directions of the
Stargate room in the central tower. The explosion, no longer contained,
blasts out windows. Smoke pours out.]
