TEASER
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[The team and Weir sit at the table. McKay is eating a sandwich and
drinking coffee.]
TEYLA
They call themselves the Genii. They are simple people, but good
farmers and fair traders.
WEIR
We're still months away from producing successful crops on the
mainland, and we're heading towards a food shortage.
MCKAY
I know. It's getting desperate. We're almost out of coffee.
SHEPPARD
Well, maybe you should stop drinking eleven cups a day.
MCKAY
I'm just making sure I get my fair share before it's all gone.
FORD
Sounds fair.
MCKAY
Mm.
SHEPPARD
I'm all for trade, but don't you think we should find a way to help
defend ourselves?
FORD
How can a bunch of farmers do that?
WEIR
Well, maybe they can introduce us to people who can help. In the
meantime, let's take care of the basics.
SHEPPARD
I guess it's always good to get to know your neighbors.
TEYLA
The Genii Stargate is a short distance from their village. I suggest
we walk. The Puddle Jumper may alarm them. As I said, they are very
simple.
WEIR
Sounds like a mission.
[Smiling, she gets up and leaves. Teyla looks at McKay, who is still
eating.]
EXT--WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--GENII PLANET
[The team exits the Stargate at start walking through the high grass.]
SHEPPARD
All right. Where to, Teyla?
TEYLA
We should allow them to come to us.
MCKAY
Well, if you know where the village is--
TEYLA
They are simple people and they trust me, but that trust was hard
earned.
SHEPPARD
Okay.
MCKAY
What is it you said they grow here, anyway?
TEYLA
Many things, but they are best known for a bean known as Tava.
MCKAY
What, java?
SHEPPARD
Tava.
FORD
How will they even know we're here, anyway?
TEYLA
They already do.
[A man and woman dressed in simple clothing approach them.]
SHEPPARD
They look friendly enough.
TEYLA
The eldest one is called Tyrus. I've traded with him on many
occasions.
TYRUS
Teyla Emmagan.
TEYLA
Tyrus. It has been many days.
TYRUS
Too many.
SORA
Teyla.
TEYLA
This is Major Sheppard, Dr. McKay and Lieutenant Ford.
TYRUS
My daughter, Sora.
SHEPPARD
You must be very proud.
[He smile, and Sora smiles back flirtatiously.]
TYRUS
(sternly)
She's betrothed.
SHEPPARD
Uh, I wasn't hitting on your daughter. I just thought--
TEYLA
They have come to trade for a share of your crops.
SORA
Yet you bring weapons.
FORD
Only to defend ourselves.
TYRUS
(to Teyla)
Do you dress as they do of your own accord?
TEYLA
Of course. Why?
SHEPPARD
He wants to know if you work with us...or for us.
TEYLA
Ah. These are my friends, Tyrus. I would not have brought them if I
did not think them worthy to become yours.
TYRUS
We'll take you to see Cowen.
(to Sora)
Go.
SORA
Follow me.
[Tyrus watches as the team follows Sora away.]
MCKAY
(to Sheppard)
Maybe we should offer a sense of humor in trade.
SHEPPARD
Sure. They can have yours.
MCKAY
(laughing sarcastically)
Oh, please, my side. You slay me.
SHEPPARD
I'm thinking about it.
[Behind them, Tyrus speaks into an advanced communications device on
his wrist.]
TYRUS
I'm bringing them in. All operations to silent mode.
[He follows the others.]
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--GENII VILLAGE, DAY
[The village is primitive with wooden structures, similar to the 19th
century on Earth.]
INT--GENII TAVERN
[The team is at a table with some Genii, including Cowen, Tyrus, and
Sora.]
COWEN
And these medicines are potent?
MCKAY
They are capable of stopping bacterial infections entirely.
SORA
It would help us through a harsh winter.
COWEN
Hmm. We will need more than you offer.
SHEPPARD
More?
FORD
I don't think you understand how cool this medicine is.
COWEN
Well, leave if you wish.
SHEPPARD
(surprised)
Leave?
(to Teyla)
I thought you said the Genii were fair traders.
TEYLA
(smiling at Cowen)
We have always been able to achieve a reasonable bargain.
COWEN
You ask for much of our harvest. New crops will have to be planted
in sufficient quantities to replenish our stores, or it is the Genii
who will starve. That amount of planting will require new land to be
cleared. Clearing more land is slow, hard work, and it will lose us
a great amount of growing time between now and the next harvest
season.
[As he speaks, McKay rolls his eyes.]
SHEPPARD
Okay. What if clearing land was fast and easy?
[Cowen and Tyrus laugh.]
COWEN
You know a simple way of uprooting the stump of a 300-year-old tree?
SHEPPARD
As a matter of fact...I do.
EXT--GENII village
[As the straw-hat wearing villagers look on, Ford sets some charges on
a large tree stump.]
SHEPPARD
Cover your ears.
COWEN
I don't understand.
MCKAY
It can be quite loud.
[Ford jogs over to the group.]
SHEPPARD
Come on. You're going to wish you did. Lieutenant?
[Ford pulls out his remote detonator readies it.]
FORD
Fire in the hole.
[Everyone covers their ears. Smiling, he pushes the detonator button.
The tree stump blows up completely. The Genii are amazed.]
FORD
It's called C-4.
COWEN
If you can supply us with a sufficient quantity of C-4, we will
supply you with the crop you require.
SHEPPARD
So, this instead of the medicine?
COWEN
As well as the medicine.
SHEPPARD
Really? That wasn't impressive enough?
COWEN
It is you who are in need.
SHEPPARD
Well, I'll have to discuss this with my people.
COWEN
I'm sure we can come to terms. Teyla, thank you for bringing us
these new trading partners. Please, stay as our guests. There will
be a Harvest Ceremony later.
TEYLA
Wonderful.
SHEPPARD
Ford?
FORD
Sir?
SHEPPARD
We're talking Harvest Ceremony.
[He nods his head in mock sincerity.]
FORD
Sounds like fun, sir.
SHEPPARD
I'll be back soon.
[He walks away, back toward the 'gate.]
MCKAY
I should go back with the Major.
[McKay leaves also. Tyrus and Sora lead Teyla and Ford the other way.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--WEIR'S OFFICE
[Weir closes her office door and turns to Sheppard in agitation.]
WEIR
Explosives? This is a scientific expedition, Major.
SHEPPARD
I know that.
WEIR
But you want us to become arms dealers.
SHEPPARD
Have you ever tried to clear a stump by hand?
WEIR
(sarcastically)
Yes. As a hobby.
[Weir sits behind her desk.]
SHEPPARD
They are taking a chance by giving us so much of their crop this
year.
WEIR
Plus the medicines I already agreed to? I think in the future,
Major, I should do the negotiating.
SHEPPARD
I did say I had to ask you first.
WEIR
Uh-huh...To terms you already agreed to.
SHEPPARD
Yes.
WEIR
Do you see why I have a problem with this?
SHEPPARD
Do we need food or not? We are on the verge of rationing and as much
as I'd like to devote every off-world mission to the pursuit of Tava
beans--
WEIR
I get your point. Tell them we agree.
EXT--GENII VILLAGE, DAY
INT--GENII TAVERN
[Everyone has gathered for the celebration. Sheppard and McKay have not
yet returned.]
COWEN
(raising a toast)
We give thanks for a plentiful harvest.
ALL
We give thanks.
COWEN
May next season be as fruitful. And to our new friends.
TYRUS
New friends.
[They take a sip of the drink. Ford coughs on his.]
FORD
Moonshine?
[Everyone laughs.]
TEYLA
I thought you were man enough.
EXT--GENII PLANET, DAY
[Sheppard and McKay walk back toward the village, or try to.]
MCKAY
You have no idea which way to go, do you?
SHEPPARD
Just trying to get my bearings.
MCKAY
Translation, "I'm lost." They were very clear which route to take.
SHEPPARD
I prefer a straight line.
MCKAY
Yes, of course, because everything's a shortcut in Sheppard's world.
[McKay's scanner beeps.]
MCKAY
Okay, there it is again.
SHEPPARD
What?
MCKAY
I'm picking up a strange reading from right over there.
[He points to what looks like the entrance to barn.]
SHEPPARD
Define strange.
MCKAY
You don't know what strange means?
SHEPPARD
I know what strange means, Rodney--
MCKAY
Weird, freakish, odd--
SHEPPARD
I'm just trying to determine whether it's worth getting off the
route back to the village.
MCKAY
It's radioactive readings in an Amish world. Your call. Look, we're
lost anyway. What difference does it make?
SHEPPARD
I am not lost... All right, let's check it out.
[McKay's scanner has continued beeping.]
INT--GENII BARN
[McKay and Sheppard approach and enter. They follow the scanner's
readings to a pile of straw. They remove the straw to reveal a large,
metal hatch device about two feet high. It doesn't match the level of
technology of the village.]
MCKAY
Oh, now, that is definitely--
SHEPPARD
Strange.
MCKAY
Yeah, not that Amish, really.
SHEPPARD
No, not so much.
MCKAY
Maybe they don't even know it's here.
[Sheppard touches one of the hinges. His hand comes away oily.]
SHEPPARD
This hatch has been oiled recently. We have to check it out.
MCKAY
Really? Of course we do.
[They lift the heavy door together. McKay turns on his rifle flashlight
and shines it in. Sheppard moves to start climbing down into it.]
SHEPPARD
All right.
MCKAY
(sarcastically)
Great.
[They climb down a short ladder to an underground chamber.]
MCKAY
The construction's architecturally advanced. I don't think the Genii
could've made this.
SHEPPARD
We need to tell Ford where we are.
(into radio)
Lieutenant, come in. Ford?
[McKay consults his beeping scanner.]
MCKAY
This place is built like a bunker. It must be shielded for RF. The
reading's stronger this way.
[Sheppard shines his rifle-mounted flashlight around the room.]
SHEPPARD
What kind of readings?
MCKAY
(sarcastically)
Palm readings.
SHEPPARD
McKay.
MCKAY
It's neutron radiation. It's definitely a...a powerful energy
source.
SHEPPARD
Okay. Let's check it out.
MCKAY
I really think we should-we should get out of here.
[Sheppard ignores him, moving further inside. He comes to a large metal
door. After checking it out, he slides it open.]
SHEPPARD
Now, this is strange.
[Inside is a huge cavern of modern equipment and a waterfall in the
distance. Suddenly, three men in military-style uniforms appear behind
them, pointing large guns at them.]
EXT--GENII TAVERN, DAY
INT--GENII TAVERN
[A man comes in via an interior door and whispers something to Cowen.
Cowen then approaches Sora, Tyrus, Ford, and Teyla.]
COWEN
If you'll excuse me, I must go tend to a dispute.
TEYLA
Is everything all right, Cowen?
COWEN
I will return shortly.
[He leaves. Teyla looks questioningly at Ford.]
INT--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM
[McKay and Sheppard are seated at a table, their field gear lying on
it. Soldiers have weapons pointed at them.]
MCKAY
Maybe they exist as two separate cultures.
SHEPPARD
Maybe. Who cares? How long are you boys planning on keeping us here?
MCKAY
You know if people could just learn to keep their secret underground
hatches locked...
[The metal doors behind them swing open and someone enters. They turn
to see who it is.]
SHEPPARD
So much for two separate cultures.
[It is Cowen, now also dressed in a military uniform.]
COWEN
(as if to himself)
What am I going to do?
INT--GENII TAVERN
[The villagers have stopped celebrating; now they stare at Teyla and
Ford.]
FORD
I'm getting a weird vibe all of a sudden.
TEYLA
I agree. I have never seen the Genii behave this way.
[They stand up.]
FORD
Listen, we're just going to step outside and see if Major Sheppard
and Dr. McKay are back.
TYRUS
No one must leave. It's not safe.
SORA
There's a Wraith ship in the area.
FORD
Wraith? Are you serious?
[Tyrus stares back but doesn't respond.]
TEYLA
We need to warn our friends.
SORA
You will draw them to us. Everyone must stay indoors.
INT--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM
[Cowen searches through all the equipment McKay and Sheppard had on
them. He picks up McKay's scanner.]
MCKAY
Oh. Can we be careful with that? It's just it's rather fragile, and
if it, uh...
[Cowen tosses it carelessly onto the table.]
COWEN
We have a problem.
SHEPPARD
Then we have something in common.
COWEN
Normally, you would already have been shot for discovering our
secret.
SHEPPARD
In which case, more of our people would show up and question our
disappearance.
COWEN
We would simply tell them the Wraith took you. With no evidence to
the contrary, they would believe us.
SHEPPARD
You were saying?
COWEN
You have technology, knowledge new to us. This C-4 of yours--
SHEPPARD
It's not for blowing up stumps.
COWEN
We have a more sophisticated application for it.
SHEPPARD
Look what you people do with your C-4 is none of our business. We
just need food. As far as your little secret down here goes, well,
uh...
MCKAY
We say, "What giant, underground bunker?"
[Sheppard gestures his agreement.]
COWEN
I want more than that.
SHEPPARD
Well, maybe we can give you...more.
COWEN
You have weapons more powerful than your C-4?
MCKAY
Are you kidding? "Weapons 'R' Us." We--
SHEPPARD
(after giving McKay a stern look)
We might.
COWEN
What if I wanted more than weapons?
MCKAY
Uh, did I mention that I know almost everything about almost
everything?
COWEN
For Teyla Emmagan to have joined with you, you must have something
much more--
SHEPPARD
Look I'm going to go out on a limb here and just say that we're
looking for allies against the Wraith. How about you guys?
[Cowen considers this.]
INT--GENII TAVERN
FORD
Listen, we just want to take a look outside.
SORA
We can't let you. It's not safe.
[Two men come in behind them.]
TEYLA
We can take care of ourselves.
[Tyrus's wrist communicator activates, and a voice comes from it.]
COWEN
(over radio)
Tyrus, please respond.
TYRUS
Receiving.
COWEN
Bring them.
[Teyla and Ford are shocked.]
TYRUS
Understood.
(to Teyla and Ford)
Relinquish your weapons.
[Several men raise their weapons on them.]
SORA
You will not be harmed.
FORD
You guys are full of surprises.
[The men usher them away.]
INT--GENNI UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
[Now dressed in military uniform, Sora and Tyrus lead Ford and Teyla
into the interrogation chamber. They take seats next to Sheppard and
McKay.]
FORD
You missed a hell of a Harvest Ceremony, Sir.
SHEPPARD
I can imagine. Oh. Teyla.
TEYLA
I am as surprised as you are by all of this, Major.
SHEPPARD
I don't know. I'm pretty surprised.
COWEN
Teyla and her people know us only as the simple farmers we show
outsiders. The secrecy of who and what we are is the only defense we
have against the Wraith.
(to his men)
One day, all that will change.
MCKAY
You think you can do that with an atomic bomb?
COWEN
Now it's you who surprise me.
MCKAY
Well, radioactive readings, your fascination with our C-4...
SHEPPARD
(shocked, to McKay)
You're just mentioning this now?
MCKAY
It just came to me when he said, "One day, all that will change." I
assume you're hoping our C-4 will solve your super-criticality
problem.
COWEN
Will it?
MCKAY
It might. Depends on your design. There's a host of other
considerations.
SHEPPARD
You know how to make an A-bomb?
MCKAY
Major, most of my high school chess team could design an A-bomb. The
actual hard part is having sufficient fissionable materials of
appropriate grade.
COWEN
And we do.
SHEPPARD
You do?
COWEN
(walking around the table as he speaks)
The Genii were once a great confederation of planets. Millennia ago,
the Wraith had driven us to the brink of total annihilation. Our
forefathers sought the protection of bunkers such as these,
originally created for wars long forgotten, and it was here that a
small number of our people managed to survive undetected. Over the
course of many, many years--generation after generation-- we have
made technological developments here in secret.
SHEPPARD
So the whole farmer thing is just a front.
TEYLA
So the Wraith do not suspect.
COWEN
More than that. We do have many mouths to feed below. I want to show
you something. Come with me.
MCKAY
Oh, that thing you so carelessly threw on the table? Can I, uh take
that along?
[Cowen tosses the scanner to McKay.]
COWEN
(to guards)
Come. Stay as you are.
[Cowen, Sora, Tyrus, and the team leave the room.]
INT--GENII UNDERGROUND BUNKER
[Cowen guides them down some stairs and into a corridor.]
COWEN
Down below, our military trains as our scientists create weapons for
them. With our atomic weapon, we believe we finally have what we
need to defeat the Wraith once and for all.
MCKAY
You do realize that long-term exposure to these levels of radiation
is extremely dangerous.
COWEN
Our scientists tell me otherwise.
MCKAY
Well, they're wrong.
SHEPPARD
Are we in danger now?
MCKAY
It would take days or weeks at these levels of radiation, but I
assume the Genii spend days or weeks down here.
COWEN
Many of our people have spent their entire lives here.
MCKAY
(to Sheppard)
Their entire, short lives. We'll be fine, just as long as you
weren't planning on having children.
[Sheppard gives him a look.]
INT--GENII LAB
[McKay is looking over the prototype nuclear bomb.]
MCKAY
Well, you're on the right track. We're about sixty years ahead of
you. That is, if you survive. This shielding is woefully inadequate.
Now, uranium how much do you have?
COWEN
Much more.
MCKAY
Yeah, but it's nowhere near weapons grade.
COWEN
We have had problems in our purifying efforts. The molecular
structure of the unwanted material is very similar to that of the
desired material.
MCKAY
Diffusion--you need to separate the 235 from the 238. When you
remove the barrier between two substances, the slight difference in
their mass causes them to separate at different rates.
COWEN
You could do this?
MCKAY
Well, of course. I just--
SHEPPARD
I think the real question is, right now, are we allies or are we
still prisoners?
INT--GENII DINING HALL
[Amid lit candles and plates of food, Cowen toasts Sheppard's team.]
COWEN
We give thanks to our new friends.
ALL
We give thanks.
[They all drink.]
COWEN
Please, eat.
[They sit down to eat.]
MCKAY
(to Ford)
You don't think there's lemon in this, do you?
FORD
I'm sure it's delicious.
MCKAY
Have you seen someone in anaphylactic shock?
FORD
(annoyed)
Eat.
COWEN
I hope that by sharing this meal we can make up in some small way
for past offenses.
SHEPPARD
I'm sure we'll get along just fine.
COWEN
What method did your people use to initiate fission reaction in your
prototype devices?
MCKAY
Well, there's two different approaches, actually--implosion and a
gun-type bomb. Both were designed to create a supercritical mass,
obviously.
SHEPPARD
Obviously.
MCKAY
Either way you go, you need an amount of refined 235 roughly
equivalent to the size of my fist...or his fist, actually.
COWEN
Well, our dreams may soon be a reality. With your help, before the
next culling, we plan to vaporize the Wraith as they sleep.
[Teyla looks at Sheppard in concern.]
SHEPPARD
What exactly is your plan?
COWEN
We intend to take advantage of their overconfidence. That is their
weakness.
SHEPPARD
Overconfidence.
SORA
They hibernate between cullings aboard their great ships, sometimes
for centuries at a time.
TYRUS
There are always wraith who watch over the sleepers, but they're
small in number.
COWEN
Small enough to be overpowered.
[The team look uncomfortable at his assumptions.]
TYRUS
We intend to sneak aboard their ships with our new weapons.
TEYLA
That may no longer be possible.
SHEPPARD
Teyla...
TEYLA
Major?
SHEPPARD
Don't you think we should listen to their whole plan before we start
poking holes in it?
TEYLA
If we are to work together, then they need to trust us, and we need
to trust them.
COWEN
Please explain.
TEYLA
I and several of my people had been captured by the Wraith. You must
understand, it was a rescue mission to save us. I am only alive
today thanks to them. As a result of that rescue--
TYRUS
You awakened the others.
SHEPPARD
They found out that there were more people where we come from.
SORA
Father, they will all awaken.
SHEPPARD
Look we took one of them prisoner.
TYRUS
The next culling was supposed to be decades away.
SHEPPARD
He said they were in no hurry, that they would take their time to
come after us.
COWEN
We had hoped to test our first atomic weapon five years from now. Do
we have that much time, Sheppard? Do we?
SHEPPARD
No.
[Cowen slams his napkin down on the table and storms out. Everyone is
uncomfortable.]
INT--GENII UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
[Sheppard rushes after Cowen.]
SHEPPARD
Cowen...
COWEN
They may detect the radiation. We have to shut down the reactors
survive this culling, and somehow plan for the next.
SHEPPARD
You're forgetting something--
COWEN
We can hide from them--
SHEPPARD
We're both on the same side--
COWEN
Ha! Once we have extracted all the information we can from you, you
will be left on the surface. You'll be the first the Wraith feed
upon, I promise you.
SHEPPARD
I've gone up against Wraith ships and I won.
COWEN
I've seen your weapons.
SHEPPARD
I'm talking about a ship. One that flies through space, with weapons
beyond anything you've ever seen. Do you really want to turn down
that kind of help?
COWEN
I think you're trying to save yourself.
SHEPPARD
Well, you're damn right I am. I say we work together, then maybe
help save each other. We both want the same thing.
INT--GENII DINING ROOM
[Tyrus and Sora are very angry.]
TYRUS
We started our experiments confident the Wraith would not appear for
many years. They will detect us the same way you did!
TEYLA
But if we work together--
SORA
Haven't you done enough?
MCKAY: We haven't even started yet. I can get your program right back
on schedule.</blockquote>
TYRUS
How?
MCKAY
I built an atomic bomb for my grade six science fair exhibit.
FORD
They let you do that up in Canada?
MCKAY
It wasn't a working model. Still, I was questioned for six hours by
the CIA, who believed I was part of a secret pre-teen organization.
Actually, it led to my first job--
[Cowen and Sheppard re-enter.]
COWEN
Major Sheppard has convinced me that we may yet prevail.
TYRUS
He has?
COWEN
If we work together.
INT--GENII ELECTRONICS ROOM
[Cowen and the others enter. The level of technology is similar to
1940's America, with a manual typewriter and tube-based gear.]
COWEN
Many generations ago, during a culling, the Genii were able to shoot
down a Wraith Dart. Although many lives were lost that day, the
ability to resist, even in some small way, gave the Genii the seeds
of hope.
[Tyrus takes a device from a drawer.]
TYRUS
This data storage device was recovered from that downed Wraith Dart.
MCKAY
It's the flash memory of a jump drive.
TYRUS
It contains information about the Hive ship it was deployed from.
COWEN
Tyrus and his daughter have been able to successfully access that
information.
MCKAY
How?
TYRUS
Through this interface.
[He connects the device to a cable, which is connected to a tube-style
television.]
MCKAY
Really?
TYRUS
We believe...
[The television shows a Wraith display in black and white.]
TYRUS
This is where a Wraith ship still sleeps.
MCKAY
The Wraith tend to self-destruct. It's probably pretty rare to get a
hold of something like this. Have you been able to access any other
data?
TYRUS
With this interface device, we believe we can access the Wraith
ship's data core.
[The display shows the surface of a planet and a Wraith ship sitting on
it.]
SHEPPARD
So this is what your whole plan is based on?
MCKAY
Well, how does getting access to a Wraith ship's computer help you?
TYRUS
With this interface device, we can learn the location of all the
Wraith ships.
SHEPPARD
So you know where to deliver your new bombs.
FORD
Makes sense.
SHEPPARD
Assuming, of course the ship we're looking at is still there.
TYRUS
Well if the Wraith are in no hurry to rally their forces, as you
claim, it will be.
SHEPPARD
This ship is nowhere near the stargate. Approaching it undetected by
foot is impossible.
COWEN
That is where your ship comes in, Major Sheppard.
[Everyone looks to him.]
SHEPPARD
I always wondered where my ship would come in.
INT--ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM
[Weir paces; Sheppard and Ford sit at the table.]
WEIR
No. How's that for an answer?
SHEPPARD
It's pithy, I'll give you that.
WEIR
I'm sure you already agreed to this.
SHEPPARD
Only because we'll get something out of it.
FORD
And we do need allies, Ma'am.
WEIR
Allies? You just said these people were ready to string you up. How
can you trust them?
SHEPPARD
Hey, I don't trust them as far as I can throw them. There's a reason
they insisted that McKay and Teyla stay there, and it's not just to
help them with their bomb. But we have something they need, and they
have something we need. I thought that's what negotiating was all
about.
WEIR
Oh, well, it is. Personally, I stop short of offering nuclear
weapons.
FORD
They were building them anyways.
WEIR
Oh, if they were building them anyways, Lieutenant, why didn't you
just say so? You realize I originally sent you out for food?
SHEPPARD
I think we can still get that.
FORD
I don't see why not.
SHEPPARD
We kind of moved past it with the whole atomic bomb thing.
WEIR
All right, bottom line, can you pull this off?
SHEPPARD
We'll have to watch our backs, but...I wouldn't put my team at risk
if I didn't think so.
WEIR
Okay, go, and then maybe we'll talk about making nuclear bombs.
INT--GENII LAB
[McKay briefs Cowen on the nuclear trigger, using a tablet computer.]
MCKAY
The spherical encasement directs the explosive forces inward, and
the resulting implosion creates extreme compression. Subcritical
mass becomes supercritical.
COWEN
Ingenious.
MCKAY
I know, and can you believe I didn't even win the science fair? So,
the practical adaptation of available equipment and resources will
be the real challenge.
COWEN
You're destined to become a hero among our people, Dr. McKay.
[He pats McKay on the shoulder and starts to leave.]
MCKAY
Right.
COWEN
As long as major Sheppard returns with the C-4.
MCKAY
(to himself)
I'm a dead man.
INT--GENII CORRIDOR
[Sora and Teyla walk, Tyrus right behind them.]
SORA
We have surprised each other.
TEYLA
The Genii are not the people I thought they were.
SORA
And look at you. I would never have thought that you'd leave your
people.
TEYLA
No. I do this for them. John Sheppard and his people have brought
new hope to our stars, Sora. They have the spirit of explorers and
the hearts of warriors. They have accepted me. But look at you.
TYRUS
How many "harvest ceremonies" did I make you endure?
TEYLA
Never again, I promise you.
[They reach the ladder back to the barn on the surface.]
TYRUS
You respected us for who we were. That gave us reason to trust you.
TEYLA
I am saddened that you could not trust me enough to share in your
secret.
TYRUS
That is our way.
[Tyrus climbs the ladder.]
SORA
Our deception was and is a matter of survival. It is a secret we are
born into that we willingly take to our graves.
TEYLA
Still...
SORA
Have we not always traded fairly with you? You should know we have
not dealt with others so graciously.
TEYLA
Perhaps this new alliance will help to open your eyes that we can
only stand against the Wraith if we do so together.
SORA
We'll have to see if your friends will live up to their promises.
EXT--GENII PLANET, DAY
[Tyrus, Teyla and Sora exit the barn and see a Puddle Jumper uncloak
and land.]
TEYLA
Well? Do you see?
[Tyrus and Sora look on in amazement.]
INT--GENII INTERROGATION ROOM
[The room is now the planning room. Everyone gears up for the mission,
preparing their weapons as well.]
SHEPPARD
We've got to get in and out as fast as possible.
COWEN
I've been studying these plans all my life.
SHEPPARD
Good. Then we'll follow your lead. We'll keep you covered during the
breach and download.
FORD
Exit plan?
SHEPPARD
Same as we came in. You'll stay with the Jumper.
FORD
Yes, Sir.
SORA
I should be going with you.
FORD
There's a good chance we could end up in a firefight.
COWEN
Sora is a skilled fighter and expert marksman, Lieutenant Ford.
Still, she must stay here, to carry on if we don't come back.
[Sora and Tyrus say wordless goodbyes. They all leave Sora behind.]
COWEN
We need you to deliver the C-4 you've promised us, Major, before we
proceed.
SHEPPARD
We need to get the proper intel first. There's no use in building a
bunch of nukes if we can't put them to use.
COWEN
Those are your terms?
SHEPPARD
I'm sure you understand.
COWEN
I do. It seems we have no choice but to trust each other.
EXT--PLANET WITH WRAITH SHIP, NIGHT
[The Puddle Jumper comes through the gate and lifts up into the sky
while cloaking.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard flies, with Ford in the co-pilot seat.]
COWEN
How many of these ships do you have?
SHEPPARD
Just the one.
[Teyla sees the Wraith cruiser sitting on the surface.]
TEYLA
(pointing)
There.
COWEN
Have they awoken?
SHEPPARD
I don't see any activity. Same as last time. All right, here we go.
Right through the front door.
[Sheppard guides the Jumper into the hangar of the ship.]
INT--WRAITH CRUISER HANGAR
[The exit the cloaked Jumper.]
SHEPPARD
Hey, hold the fort.
FORD
Yes, sir. Good luck.
INT--WRAITH CRUISER INTERIOR
[The team explores the ship. They hear Wraith slithering sounds. They
come upon humans in stasis cocoons.]
MCKAY
Oh, god.
TEYLA
These people were cocooned for a later feeding. Some of them may
still be alive.
COWEN
We don't have time for this.
SHEPPARD
They could be your people, for all you know. Teyla, take care of
this. We'll meet you back at the ship. McKay, you're with me.
[They start to move away, but Cowen is unhappy.]
TYRUS
I'll stay with her. Go. We'll meet you back at the ship.
[He gives Cowen the Wraith flash drive. Cowen leaves.]
[Later, Cowen, Sheppard, and McKay find a closed door.]
COWEN
This is it, but the ship's plans I memorized did not include the
details on how to operate this door.
SHEPPARD
If we try to blow this door, it's going to make too much noise.
MCKAY
So find another way. Okay.
[He pulls out his scanner and holds it up to the door.]
MCKAY
Can I get some light here?
[Sheppard shines his flashlight on the door. McKay cuts into the
material covering the door. He pulls it apart to reveal organic tubing
behind.]
MCKAY
Beautiful.
INT--NEAR COCOONS
[Elsewhere, Teyla and Tyrus look at the cocoons. Suddenly a hand thrust
out of one of them. It is a man.]
COCOONED VICTIM
Please! Help me!
TEYLA
We're going to get you out.
COCOONED VICTIM
Please...
[Teyla tries to help the man, but Tyrus pulls her away.]
TEYLA
What are you doing?
TYRUS
We cannot free him. We can save none of them.
TEYLA
What?
COCOONED VICTIM
Please help...
TEYLA
You would leave him here to die?
TYRUS
Listen, the Wraith must not know we were ever here.
[Teyla tries to get past him, but he holds her back.]
TYRUS
I said no.
COCOONED VICTIM
I beg you.
INT--AT WRAITH LOCKED DOOR
[McKay has attached his scanner to the tubing.]
SHEPPARD
McKay, we don't have--
MCKAY
Look, I don't even know if this is going to--
[The doors open for a moment then close.]
MCKAY
Work.
[He tries again. The doors open to reveal a control or computer room.]
MCKAY
Bingo.
SHEPPARD
All right. I'll cover your six. Go.
[Cowen and McKay go in.]
INT--NEAR COCOONS
[Teyla is furious.]
TYRUS
If you free him, they will know he was taken.
TEYLA
You are not the man I believed you to be.
TYRUS
This ship is closest to our world. The Genii will be the first to
die if they awaken.
COCOONED VICTIM
(screaming)
Help me!
TYRUS
I said leave him!
COCOONED VICTIM
No!
TYRUS
Be silent!
[He turns and, in a panic, shoots the man, killing him. Teyla is
horrified. A Wraith drone comes running in, its stunner raised. It
shoots Tyrus twice. Teyla fires on it, killing it.]
INT--AT WRAITH CONTROL ROOM
TEYLA
(over radio)
Major, we have been discovered.
SHEPPARD
(calling to the others)
We've got to get out of here.
INT--NEAR COCOONS
[More drones arrive. Teyla retreats, leaving Tyrus behind.]
INT--AT WRAITH CONTROL ROOM
[McKay and Cowen come out of the room to join Sheppard.]
MCKAY
We've got it.
[Cowen holds up the Wraith flash memory. They rush off.]
INT--WRAITH HANGAR
[Teyla joins Ford, who is already ready for combat. The others come
running.]
TEYLA
Wraith guards. Hurry. More are coming.
[They enter the cloaked Jumper.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard rushes to the pilot chair. The rear ramp closes.]
COWEN
Where's Tyrus?
TEYLA
He was struck by a Wraith weapon.
COWEN
But he may have only been stunned.
TEYLA
By now, the Wraith will be upon him.
[The ship is hit by weapons fire.]
COWEN
Go. Go!
SHEPPARD
All right, hang on.
[Cowen looks with disapproval at Teyla. Sheppard pilots the ship out.
Cowen sits heavily in the back of the ship, clearly saddened and
suspicious.]
EXT--GENII WORLD, DAY
[The Puddle Jumper has landed. Sora and others approach, meeting the
Atlantis team and Cowen.]
SORA
Where is my father?
COWEN
He did not survive.
SORA
(distraught)
How? What happened?
COWEN
I think we should find out.
(to his men)
Take aim.
[Men from the nearby woods come out and surround the team, who raises
their weapons in response.]
SHEPPARD
Cowen...I thought we were just learning how to get along.
COWEN
She killed Tyrus.
TEYLA
No.
COWEN
By leaving him to die, you may just as well have killed him
yourself.
TEYLA
He shot the man we tried to save.
COWEN
It was a mistake to try and save anyone. It jeopardized the mission.
We will keep this intelligence information.
[He takes the memory device out of his pocket.]
SHEPPARD
You're the one making a mistake.
COWEN
And your ship and whatever quantities of C-4 you have in your
possession.
TEYLA
That is all you ever intended, to use us.
COWEN
And for your efforts, I will spare your lives.
MCKAY
Generous of you.
SHEPPARD
I guess the Tava beans are off the table.
COWEN
Your weapons.
SHEPPARD
No. I don't think so.
COWEN
We have the advantage, Major.
SHEPPARD
Yeah.
TEYLA
This is what your father died for? In the name of people who would
lie and steal from those they would call friends?
SHEPPARD
Well, I lied, too.
(into radio)
Jumpers two and three execute.
[Two Jumpers uncloak just behind and above Sheppard's team.]
SHEPPARD
You didn't really think we had one ship, did you? Tell your people
to get back. Nobody gets hurt. Jumper Two, prepare to fire on my
mark.
COWEN
Wait. Do you promise to leave?
SHEPPARD
Well, that's the plan. I guess we'll have to go somewhere else to
find our Tava beans. But, I think it's only fair we end up with
something.
[He takes the memory device from Cowen.]
COWEN
You do not want to make an enemy of the Genii.
SHEPPARD
(in Cowen's face)
You know what? Same here.
[The Atlantis team backs off to their Jumper.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir guides Sheppard to Grodin's station.]
WEIR
Major, I thought you might like to see this.
GRODIN
A lot of the information we downloaded from the data storage device
was encrypted, so we're still working on that.
SHEPPARD
Yeah, I didn't think it would be easy.
GRODIN
But we were able to ascertain the existence of twenty-one Wraith
Hive ships just in our quadrant of the Pegasus Galaxy alone.
SHEPPARD
Twenty-one?
GRODIN
And there are indications of far more elsewhere in Pegasus.
SHEPPARD
Well, how many more?
GRODIN
Well, there's no way of knowing for sure. Perhaps 60 or more.
SHEPPARD
That's a lot of ships.
GRODIN
Some of them already appear to be on the move.
SHEPPARD
Toward us?
GRODIN
That's the part we're still working on.
WEIR
So even if were to have helped the Genii build nuclear warheads...
SHEPPARD
We only could have nuked a handful of them simultaneously.
WEIR
Exactly.
GRODIN
There's far too many Wraith ships for a coordinated attack.
WEIR
The Genii plan never would have worked...with or without our help.
GRODIN
I'll see what else I can find.
WEIR
Thank you, Peter.
[Grodin leaves. Weir and Sheppard walk toward the balcony.]
WEIR
You might be happy to know Sergeant Bates was able to broker a small
trade agreement for food while you were gone.
SHEPPARD
Oh, he did, did he?
WEIR
Yes, he did, but it's not a competition.
SHEPPARD
So who are these people?
WEIR
They're traders. They call themselves Manarians. I'm sorry you
weren't able to find the allies you were looking for, John.
SHEPPARD
Well, we gathered some valuable intel. That's something.
WEIR
Huh. Are you trying to convince me this is good news?
SHEPPARD
I much prefer to know what we're up against than not.
WEIR
Sixty ships...or more.
SHEPPARD
I just hope they don't all come at once.
FADE OUT
