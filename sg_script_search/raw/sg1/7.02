into the Gate room to greet them.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, Major.
CARTER
The mission objective was a success, Sir. Anubis's new weapon has
been neutralised.
HAMMOND
Well done. What about Jonas and Dr Jackson?
O'NEILL
Still on the ship.
CARTER
Anubis went into hyperspace before we could do anything.
HAMMOND
Do we have any idea where they went? CARTER
No, Sir.
INT: ANUBIS' SHIP
[Jonas enters.]
ANUBIS
You appear to be unharmed by the mind probe.
JONAS
I appreciate your concern. You seem calm considering some lowly
humans just put a serious in your plans for galactic domination.
ANUBIS
Your insolence amuses me. I have learned many valuable things from
you, Jonas Quinn. I now know Dr Jackson accompanied you aboard this
ship.
JONAS
Do you know where he is?
ANUBIS
He continues to elude our sensors, but his time is running out.
JONAS
Nothing you learn from me is going to help you.
ANUBIS
Oh, we will see about that. Have a look out the window.
JONAS
We jumped out of hyperspace.
ANUBIS
I am eager to find out more about this powerful variation of naquada
discovered on your planet. I believe you call it naquadria.
JONAS
Where are we?
ANUBIS
Welcome home, Jonas Quinn!

HAMMOND
We just received a report from Tok'ra intelligence. So far, they
have no information on the whereabouts of Anubis's ship.
O'NEILL
What about Teal'c?
HAMMOND
We haven't heard anything. We can only assume he is still with Yu's
fleet.
CARTER
Any idea why they didn't show?
O'NEILL
I could make a guess.
HAMMOND
You think Yu hung us out to dry?
O'NEILL
I'm not going to touch that, Sir.
CARTER
I don't think he would have made a deal with Anubis, not with their
history.
O'NEILL
Trust a Goa'uld, this is what you get.
HAMMOND
I understand how you feel, Colonel, but I approved this operation
because I believed it was our best chance to deal Anubis a crippling
blow.
O'NEILL
Yes, Sir.
TECHNICIAN DAVIS
(as Stargate starts to operate)
Unscheduled offworld activation! We are receiving a radio signal,
Sir.
Ambassador DREYLOCK'S voice is heard.
This is Ambassador Dreylock, of the Kelownan High Council. Please
respond.
HAMMOND
This is General Hammond of Stargate Command.
DREYLOCK
We request immediate assistance. We are under attack.
HAMMOND
We've been over this, Ambassador. We cannot interfere in the
internal affairs of your planet.
DREYLOCK
You don't understand. We are under attack from a Goa'uld. He calls
himself Anubis.
O'NEILL
Oy!

Why have I been detained? Lord Yu is without honour.
JAFFA

OSHU
(First Prime of Lord Yu)
Jaffa!
[He orders the Jaffa to leave.]
TEAL'C
We had an agreement.
OSHU
You have not been betrayed, not deliberately.
TEAL'C
I do not understand.
OSHU
My master is not well. He spends most of his time in the
sarcophagus. He is there even now.
TEAL'C
Why does he not take another host?
OSHU
I believe he has reached the point where he is incapable. Lord Yu is
the oldest of the System Lords. He has reigned for countless
centuries but now I am beginning to fear that even gods cannot live
forever.
TEAL'C
Lord Yu is not a god.
OSHU
There was a time I would have struck you down for speaking those
words.
TEAL'C
But now?
OSHU
He was convinced that Anubis was entering our System. But even
though I knew this was not the case, I could not contradict him.
TEAL'C
But you have seen that Lord Yu can make mistakes.
OSHU
He has become increasingly paranoid, I concede. He speaks to himself
but his words make no sense and he forgets the key details of our
attack plans and grows angry when I remind him.
TEAL'C
If what you say is true, you and your Jaffa are in grave danger. You
must do something.
OSHU
I cannot betray him. I have devoted my life to his service.
TEAL'C
If this continues, Lord Yu's empire will fall. Millions of Jaffa
will die. Lord Yu will be remembered as a fool. What meaning will
your life have then?

DREYLOCK
Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter.
CARTER
Ambassador, Commander.
DREYLOCK
Thank you for coming.
O'NEILL
What's going on, kids?
HALE
A ship is hovering over the city. Alien troops have already taken
the Capital building as well as other key positions.
CARTER
Where are we exactly?
HALE
This bunker is several hundred feet below an army base on the
outskirts of the city.
CARTER
The communicator should work. It was designed to transmit from
Tok'ra tunnels.
DREYLOCK
I don't understand.
CARTER
We believe two of our people may be on board that ship. One being
Jonas Quinn.
O'NEILL

Daniel, Daniel, come in. This is O'Neill. (pause)

DANIEL
(on board Anubis's ship)
Jack?
O'NEILL
What is your situation?
DANIEL
I'm hiding. What's yours?
O'NEILL
Carter and I are on the planet.
DANIEL
You're going to have to be a little more specific, Jack. I haven't
had time to look out a window lately.
O'NEILL
You are hovering over Jonas's homeworld.
DANIEL
Why?
O'NEILL
I wish I knew. Are you in any immediate danger?
DANIEL
Depends what you mean by immediate.
O'NEILL
Daniel!
DANIEL
I'm fine. I found the location of Jonas's cell from the ship's
computer. I'm on my way there now. I have just got a couple of
problems.
O'NEILL
Like what?
DANIEL
Well, I'm not sure how to shut off the force-field protecting his
cell yet.
O'NEILL
You said a couple.
DANIEL
Yeah, actually I'm a little lost at the moment. And I've only got
about three hours left before the Tok'ra isotope wears off and I'm
visible to the ship's sensors.
O'NEILL
So...business as usual then, huh?
DANIEL
I don't know. Is it?
O'NEILL
Yes--we do this kind of thing all the time.
DANIEL
Ah, well, good--that's comforting then.
EXT: YU'S SHIP
INT: YU'S SHIP
OSHU
This is a mistake.
TEAL'C
Lord Yu can no longer be permitted to command the opposition to
Anubis. His Jaffa will follow your orders in his name, but others
will not. And we need the combined force of the System Lords.
OSHU
None of them can be trusted.
TEAL'C
Then the last one must be chosen.
OSHU
His signal is coming through.
[Ba'al appears on a screen before them.]
BA'AL
What is the meaning of this?
OSHU
Lord Ba'al...
BA'AL
Where is your master? Why do you allow this sholva to appear before
me?
TEAL'C
I am here to present an offer.
BA'AL
I will not listen to the words of a traitor.
TEAL'C
Then you will miss an opportunity to rid yourself of Anubis forever.
INT: KELOWNA--COMMAND BUNKER
HALE
When the ship appeared, we were caught completely off-guard. There
was widespread panic. Before we even knew what was happening, most
of the High Council had been taken hostage. When we wouldn't give in
to his demands, Anubis had the First Minister executed. He also
fired a volley into our industrial sector, destroying several
factories and killing many innocent citizens. After that, we gave
him what he wanted.
O'NEILL
Which was?
HALE
Naquadria. Our entire stockpile.
DREYLOCK
(entering)
Commander. We are receiving a transmission from the surface.
HALE
Excuse me a moment.
CARTER
Anubis must have used that mind probe on Jonas. That's how he found
out about the naquadria.
O'NEILL
Well, if he did, he knows the stuff only works half the time.
CARTER
Just because we haven't been able to establish a stable power
output, doesn't mean he won't.
O'NEILL
Da da da dum? Da da da dum?
INT: YU'S SHIP
OSHU
The truth is, my master is no longer able to lead the combined
forces of the System Lords.
BA'AL
How dare you judge your god! The sholva has poisoned your mind.
TEAL'C
Clearly Lord Ba'al is not interested.
OSHU
We should contact one of the other System Lords.
TEAL'C
Hmm. Perhaps Bastet.
BA'AL
If I assume command, how can I be assured of the loyalty of Yu's
troops?
OSHU
They will follow me in his name.
BA'AL
And will you obey me?
OSHU
The destruction of Anubis is in my master's best interests. I will
support any action that leads to this goal.
TEAL'C
If you are both in agreement, I must contact the Tau'ri to make the
final arrangements.
BA'AL
Then do so.

TEAL'C
Take me to the nearest Stargate.
EXT: ANUBIS' SHIP HOBERING OVER KELOWNA
INT: KELOWNA--COMMAND BUNKER
CARTER
Commander, you said you gave Anubis your entire stockpile of
naquadria.
HALE
That is correct.
CARTER
So, if he got what he wanted, why is he still here?
HALE
I have no idea. We just learned his men have been rounding up
archaeologists from the Academy of Sciences.
CARTER
He may he trying to find the Stargate.
O'NEILL
How secure is this place?
HALE
It's top secret. We had the Gate moved here after the Teranians and
Andaris began their air strikes.
CARTER
So you did go to war?
DREYLOCK
Yes, but we managed to negotiate a ceasefire.
O'NEILL
I thought you were outgunned and outmanned?
HALE
We used the naquadria bomb.
O'NEILL
On people?
DREYLOCK
Believe me, everyone immediately regretted it. The devastation was
beyond anything we could have ever imagined.
HALE
We had no choice. As many Kelownans would have died, had we done
nothing. We were faced with our own destruction and you refused to
help us.
DREYLOCK
And as awful as it was, it did succeed in bringing the Teranians and
Andaris to the table. In fact, delegates had just arrived in the
city for peace talks when all of this began.
CARTER
Do they know about the Stargate?
HALE
No.
O'NEILL
Well, they may have noticed the rather large ship floating in the
sky. You might as well tell them the rest.
HALE
We were hoping it wouldn't come to that. Anubis has everything he
came for. He may just leave.
CARTER
If Anubis can figure out how to overcome the instability of the
naquadria, it will give him a significant advantage over all of his
enemies. Sooner or later, he is going to want more.
DREYLOCK
There is no more. The mine is dry.
CARTER
And you think he is going to take your word for it? He will occupy
this planet and enslave your people. We've seen it before.
HALE
What can we do?
CARTER
If you want to fight, we will help you. But we need the co-operation
of the other major powers on this world.
INT: ANUBIS' SHIP
GOA'ULD SCIENTIST
My Lord, I have completed a preliminary analysis of the naquadria.
The potential energy output is very much greater than that of
regular naquada. The difficulty will be in maintaining a stable
reaction.
ANUBIS
This ship must have full power again. I will not accept failure.
GOA'ULD SCIENTIST
My Lord, we have already learned all we can from Jonas Quinn. Why
keep him alive?
ANUBIS
His physiology merits further experimentation. He may still prove to
be very useful.

Well, Quinn, I don't know how to tell you this, but Anubis has taken
the ship to your homeworld. We are in position right above the
Kelownan capital.
JONAS
I know. He's after the naquadria. It's my fault. If it wasn't for
me, he never would have found out about it.
DANIEL
Don't blame yourself.
JONAS
The point is, I joined Stargate Command so that maybe one day I
could protect my planet from the Goa'uld, instead I brought them
right to it.

DANIEL
Apparently.
INT: KELOWNA--COMMAND BUNKER

moment, his goal is the same as ours.
O'NEILL
All right, have at it. Oh yes, you do the talking.
TEAL'C
We have made an agreement with another System Lord named Ba'al. If
we give him the location of this world, he will bring a fleet and
destroy Anubis.
NOOR
You propose to bring more of these Goa'uld to our world?
TEAL'C
For the moment, Anubis is vulnerable. He has but one ship and is
preoccupied. But he believes his position to be secure because he
knows the other System Lords are unaware of this place.
HALE
And if Anubis is destroyed, how do we know this Ba'al will leave us
alone?
TEAL'C
That is part of the agreement.
HALE
You say we cannot negotiate with Anubis, and that these Goa'uld
cannot be trusted!
NOOR
And yet you ask us to trust another!
TEAL'C
Your world is facing an imminent threat.
SEVARIN
Kelowna is facing an imminent threat. There are no alien ships in
the skies above Terania.
HALE
See what we have to deal with?
O'NEILL
Haven't you guys ever heard the story of the dog and the dancing
monkeys? It has something to do with getting along,
and...dancing...Carter?
CARTER
With all due respect, Mr Ambassador, when Anubis comes looking for
more naquadria, he's not going to respect any borders. He will tear
this planet apart piece by piece if he has to.
O'NEILL
Bottom line is, I'm not going to approve any plan unless I have
unanimous agreement from all parties.

want it tested immediately.
GOA'ULD SCIENTIST
We will need to select a target.
ANUBIS
How fortunate that there is a city before us.

Anubis has superior shields, but according to our intelligence, they

chance.

That's not very reassuring.
DREYLOCK
We just received a report. Anubis's men are ransacking the Museum of
Antiquities.
CARTER
Why would they do that?
HALE
They may still be looking for the Stargate as you said.
CARTER
No. Anubis is smart enough to know that it wouldn't be in a public
place. What was in the Museum?
DREYLOCK
Nothing. The entire exhibit was packed up and put into storage when
the war began.
CARTER
Okay. What was in the exhibit?
HALE
Minor trinkets from the original Goa'uld dig sites. Pottery,
statues.
CARTER
What about tablets?
HALE
Those were classified top secret and given to the scientists working
on our naquadria project.

stand a chance.
O'NEILL
The main problem is the ship. Once that's taken out, we can deal
with the Jaffa.
CARTER
Sir, I think I know why Anubis hasn't left yet. He's looking for a
crystal. The Kelownan archaeologists found it with the other Goa'uld
artifacts but they didn't know what it was. They classified it as a
decorative object and placed it in a Museum display.
HALE
I don't understand. What is it?
CARTER
The Goa'uld use crystals to store information.
DREYLOCK
What kind of information?
CARTER
Well, we know from the tablets that the original Goa'uld who
occupied this planet was experimenting with naquadria, but they
don't give any details. There are no lab notes, no test results.
HALE
And you think that's what's on the crystal?
CARTER
Well, it makes sense. Your people didn't know it was important. They
never included it with the other material from the naquadria
project, which is why Jonas never knew about it either. Sir, if
Anubis gets hold of this crystal, he could use it to adapt his
systems and make the naquadria work.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I get it. Where is it?
HALE
Everything was moved to a warehouse for safekeeping.
DREYLOCK
I can take you there.
HALE
Wait. If this is as important as you say it is, let me sent a
contingent to secure the building.

[Her'ak threatens O'Neill with a staff weapon.]
HER'AK
I could kill you now.
O'NEILL
Publicly is fine.
HER'AK
Jaffa!
EXT: GOA'ULD SYSTEM LORDS FLEET DROP OUT OF HYPERSPACE
[In space, Ba'al is bombarding Anubis, who has been attacking Kelowna.
The resulting tremors rock the bunker, enabling O'Neill, Carter,
Teal'c, Daniel and Jonas, to take on the Jaffa. A firefight ensues.]
INT: ANUBIS' SHIP
BA'AL
(on screen in Anubis's ship)
Your ship is at my mercy. You are defeated. Surrender now!
EXT: ESCAPE VESSEL ACCELERATES AWAY FROM ANUBIS' DISINTEGRATING SHIP
INT: KELOWNA--COMMAND BUNKER
[Daniel is reaching for the crystal which has skittered across the
floor. One of the Jaffa goes to shoot Daniel with a staff weapon.]
JONAS
Daniel!
[Jonas pushes Daniel out of the way, getting hit in the side by a staff
blast as he does so.]
CARTER
Jonas!
DANIEL
I owe you one.
JONAS
Call it even.
INT: SGC GATE ROOM
[Jonas enters, his right arm in a sling. The SGC personnel are lined up
by the ramp.]
DREYLOCK
The last time you returned to Kelowna, you were considered a
traitor. That will not be the case this time.
JONAS
Are you sure about that?
DREYLOCK
The Andaris and Teranians would only agree to participate in the
Joint Ruling Council on the condition that you are the Kelownan
representative. Your experiences over the past year will be vital to
our planet forging ahead and facing what awaits in our future. We
need you, Jonas.
O'NEILL
Got everything packed? Toothbrush? Slippers? Hair gel?
JONAS
Yes.
[Jonas goes to General Hammond.]
JONAS
Sir.
HAMMOND
It was an honour, son.
JONAS
Yes, it was. (To Daniel)
You know, when we first met, you told me that the issues between my
planet's nations would seem insignificant once I found out what was
really going on up there.
DANIEL
Yeah, I remember that.
JONAS
You do?
DANIEL
Yeah.
JONAS
Hey, that's great!
DANIEL
It's kind of coming back.
JONAS
Anyway, I'm just glad I had the chance to find out.
DANIEL
Me too.
[Jonas moves to Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
You have the heart of a warrior, Jonas Quinn. Continue to fight
well.
CARTER
(hugs Jonas)
Keep in touch.
O'NEILL
You earned it.
JONAS
Thanks.
[Jonas picks up his bag and walks up the ramp. He stops halfway and
turns.]
JONAS
Hey, Daniel! Feed my fish.
[Everyone leaves the Gate room, except O'Neill and Daniel.]
O'NEILL
You all right?
DANIEL
Yeah.
O'NEILL
Well, dinner's at seven. Don't be late. Teal'c gets a little cranky
when his blood sugar gets low.
DANIEL
Jack, it's not that I mind rejoining SG-1 and exploring the galaxy,
meeting new cultures, jeopardy, saving the world, that kind of
thing.
(beat)
We get paid for this, right?
JACK
(beat; smiling warmly)
Welcome back.
[Daniel turns to stare up at the Stargate.]
