TEASER
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The members of SG-1 come through the Gate and head down the ramp.
Daniel leads the way, holding his hands out in front of him, one with a
bandage on.]
CARTER
We have to get to the infirmary. Daniel's been exposed to radiation.
[Hammond looks up at Davis in the control room.]
HAMMOND
Have a medical team meet us on the way.
DAVIS
Medical team to Alpha Two. Repeat, medical team to Alpha Two.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[SG-1 and Hammond follow behind Daniel.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, what happened?
O'NEILL
The details are a little sketchy, sir.
TEAL'C
We were not present at the time of the incident.
[A couple of medical technicians meet them on the way. Daniel pulls
away from them.]
DANIEL
Don't touch me!
CARTER
He may still be radioactive.
[Janet comes out to meet them.]
FRAISER
Let's get him scrubbed down.
[The technicians follow Daniel into the infirmary. Janet stops in the
doorway and turns to face SG-1.]
FRAISER
Do we know what kind and how much?
CARTER
It was a device housing an unstable radioactive variation of
naquadah. We think his right hand was exposed to the equivalent of
over eight to nine grays of neutron radiation resulting from direct
contact. Full body exposure of over seven.
FRAISER
Oh, my God.
HAMMOND
Doctor?
CARTER
It's a lethal dose, sir.

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond enters the room and sits down at the table where O'Neill,
Carter, and Teal'c are already gathered.]
HAMMOND
As you were. Dr Fraiser tells me there's nothing more we can do for
Dr Jackson at the moment. In the meantime, tell me what happened.
[O'Neill gestures for Carter to start.]
CARTER
Well sir, as you know from our initial reports, Kelowna is one of
three major countries on 4C3. What we've learned since our initial
contact is that they appear to be at a similar stage of development
to that of the United States in the 1940's. Geopolitically, there is
obvious mounting tension between the nations.
O'NEILL
Sort of like a cold war, sir.
CARTER
The Kelownans discovered their Stargate approximately 15 years ago,
unearthing it along with a number of Goa'uld artifacts in what
appears to be an ancient temple.
TEAL'C
Their knowledge of the Gate is still limited.
CARTER
But their interest is strong. When we told them what we could offer,
they were eager to share any technologies they were developing that
could potentially be offered in exchange.
FLASHBACK
INT--A BUILDING IN THE KELOWNAN CAPITAL CITY
[SG-1 comes through a door, and they are met by Jonas Quinn.]
JONAS
This is incredible. It is a pleasure to meet you. I'm Jonas Quinn,
I'm a special advisor to our High Minister.
O'NEILL
Security's a little tight around here, I noticed.
JONAS
As you have undoubtedly been told, this is one of our most secret
and important research operations.
[He points to his own forehead, then points to Teal'c tattoo curiously.
Daniel holds out his hand.]
DANIEL
Daniel Jackson.
[He and Jonas shake hands.]
O'NEILL
Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Sam Carter, and the tall, silent one is
Teal'c.
JONAS
Teal'c. Well, your arrival on our planet is an extraordinary event.
It's my honor to show you around this facility. Please, follow me.
END FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
CARTER
He's an advisor to the High Minister.
O'NEILL
Their equivalent to our President.
CARTER
As we understand it, Jonas was responsible for overseeing the
research from an ethical perspective.
O'NEILL
Yeah, whatever.
CARTER
He had several degrees from their most honored education
institution. Social studies, ancient Kelownan history--
O'NEILL
He was a nerd, sir. He and Daniel got along great.
FLASHBACK
INT--CORRIDOR IN THE SAME KELOWNAN BUILDING
[Jonas is leading SG-1 to another room.]
DANIEL
If we could have access to the site where the Gate was discovered
and see the artifacts, we have this process called carbon dating. If
I could determine the age of the temple, maybe even figure out how
it was destroyed.
JONAS
I'm sure that can be arranged. Our archaeologists believe they have
only begun to uncover the full extent of what may be buried. There
were extensive alien writings.
DANIEL
Teal'c and I could help with the translation.
O'NEILL
Daniel?
JONAS
I understand from our leaders that your knowledge and expertise will
come at a price, Colonel. That is why you're here, right?
O'NEILL
Well don't get me wrong, we want to help out as much we can, it's
just that we've been burned a little bit in the past.
DANIEL
We're not questioning so much what you have to offer in return.
CARTER
We just want to get to know you better first.
O'NEILL
That's it.
JONAS
Still, hopefully we'll have much of value to offer in exchange. This
way.
[They end up in an observation room overlooking a lab. Several men in
radiation suits are working there. A light in the room changes from red
to blue, indicating the lab is safe to enter.]
JONAS
We can go in now.
[They enter the room while the men take off their helmets.]
JONAS
This is Tomis Leed. He is chief physicist overseeing the development
of our most critical project. Tomis, this is SG-1, of the planet
Earth.
TOMIS
My pleasure.
CARTER
What is this?
TOMIS
The core of this device was uncovered in an ancient temple of a race
of people we believe were called the Guld.
TEAL'C
Goa'uld.
JONAS
Really?
TOMIS
It's a mineral substance found to have highly unstable radioactive
properties. This experiment seems to indicate the potential for
great bursts of energy.
JONAS
Our translation of the writings in the temple indicate that the
alien element is called naquadria.
DANIEL
Naqahdah.
JONAS
No, we also translated that word in the same text. This is
definitely naquadria.
CARTER
So this is some sort of power generating device?
JONAS
Not exactly.
END FLASHBACK
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
O'NEILL
They were making a bomb, sir.
CARTER
They were far from achieving a deliverable weapon, but if successful
it would have been as powerful as a naqahdah-enhanced nuclear
warhead.
TEAL'C
The Kelownans claimed they were under threat of oppression from
their neighboring nations and the weapon would only be used to
ensure their freedom.
HAMMOND
Sounds like a situation we would have to be very careful about
getting involved in.
CARTER
Yes, sir.
O'NEILL
I'm not sure we need to worry about that, General.
HAMMOND
How so?
O'NEILL
I don't think they want our help any longer.
HAMMOND
Something to do with how Dr Jackson was exposed to that much
radiation?
CARTER
We were touring the city. Daniel was at the research facility with
Jonas. As I'm sure you can imagine, he was pretty passionate about
trying to convince the Kelownan people that building a big bomb
wasn't going to be the answer to their problems.
O'NEILL
Still, we don't know.
HAMMOND
Colonel, what do you know?
[O'Neill looks at Carter.]
CARTER
Sir, they're claiming Daniel tried to sabotage their research.
O'NEILL
They're lying, General.
TEAL'C
I also do not believe this to be true.
CARTER
They let us bring him back home on compassionate grounds.
O'NEILL
The fact is, they just didn't want us around there anymore.
CARTER
But they are demanding that he be returned to face the charges if he
survives.
HAMMOND
What is Dr. Jackson saying happened?
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel is sitting on the bed wearing a white infirmary clothing, with
O'Neill sitting beside him in a chair.]
DANIEL
The nausea will be followed be tremors, convulsions and something
called ataxia. Surface tissue, brain tissue and internal organs will
inflame and degrade, I believe that's called necrosis. Now based on
the dose of radiation I got, all that will happen in the next ten to
fifteen hours, and if I don't drown in my own fluids first, I will
bleed to death, and there is no medical treatment to prevent that.
O'NEILL
Maybe not that we know of.
DANIEL
Jack, we don't go running to our offworld allies every time an
individual's life is at stake. And don't go telling me that this is
any different, because my life is no more valuable than anybody
else's.
O'NEILL
What happened?
DANIEL
It doesn't matter.
O'NEILL
Yes, it does. You didn't try to sabotage anything.
DANIEL
There was an accident. I guess the scientists figured the government
would hold them responsible. I guess they figured it was easier to
blame me.
O'NEILL
And you're okay with this?
DANIEL
No. But there's not much I can do about that.
O'NEILL
Yes, there is.
DANIEL
If they really want to blame me, denying it isn't going to change
anything. Ten thousand years ago, a Goa'uld tried the same
experiments that they're trying and he nearly blew the entire planet
to bits. I tried telling them that, they wouldn't listen.They're
gonna build that bomb and nothing we say is gonna stop them.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[He rises from behind his desk as O'Neill walks in.]
HAMMOND
The Asgard are still not responding, Jack. We've tried to reach
Jacob Carter but last we heard he's on a mission to recover the last
remaining undercover Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
General, we do have intelligence on a sarcophagus.
HAMMOND
SG3's mission report two months ago.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
HAMMOND
We both know the negative effects of that technology, Colonel.
O'NEILL
But Daniel's been in one of those things a dozen times. Once more
isn't going to hurt.
HAMMOND
However, SG-3's report clearly indicated that the sarcophagus is
heavily guarded and likely retrieving it would result in significant
casualties, which is why I did not order a recovery mission at the
time.
O'NEILL
Sir...
HAMMOND
Colonel, please don't think you're alone in your feelings on this
matter.
O'NEILL
Yes, sir.
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[She's studying the readout on a computer screen as O'Neill walks in.]
O'NEILL
Got anything?
CARTER
Well I've been doing some calculations.
O'NEILL
Anything to help Daniel?
CARTER
I wish. Based on the amount of radiation the Kelownans say Daniel
was exposed to, I've estimated the amount of energy that would have
been generated by the experiment.
O'NEILL
And?
CARTER
The potential's astronomical, sir. Even a very small amount of the
unstable element they're working with emitted a pulse of energy far
greater than anything I've ever believed possible. Much more than
weapons grade naquadah would have. It would require a massive
nuclear reaction to even approach this level.
O'NEILL
So?
CARTER
Sir, this could be the missing link we've been looking for in terms
of generating the kind of energy I believe is necessary to create a
hyperspace window. Or, to generate and sustain the kind of shields
the Goa'uld have been using to protect their ships. Sir, we have to
get some of this element.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c are once again sitting at the
table.]
HAMMOND
By now their government believes Dr Jackson was trying to sabotage
their research.
O'NEILL
It's a lie. They're using Daniel as a scapegoat.
HAMMOND
Still, you said he was vocal in his disapproval of their project
before the accident. None of this bodes well for diplomatic
relations.
O'NEILL
Why are you talking about diplomatic relations? This is Daniel's
life.
CARTER
Sir, I know how you feel because I feel the same way, but I cannot
stress enough how valuable this element could be.
HAMMOND
I will draft a letter to the Kelownan leader...
O'NEILL
General, you cannot capitulate to these people. They are lying
bastards.
HAMMOND
Their government doesn't know the truth.
O'NEILL
So, we tell them.
HAMMOND
They will have little reason to believe us over their own people,
especially when what we're forcing them to admit would be a major
embarrassment. It will put them at too great a disadvantage in
further negotiations.
O'NEILL
Sir, you cannot admit Daniel is guilty.
HAMMOND
Give me some credit, Jack. I will tell them that we did not order
any such action and do not condone its obvious intentions, both of
which are true. Hopefully, we can lay the groundwork for further
diplomatic negotiations which will eventually result in an amicable
trade for the naquadria. I'm ordering you to deliver the letter.
O'NEILL
Fine, sir.
INT--CORRIDOR IN THE SAME KELOWNAN BUILDING
[Jonas is going over something with a female scientist, and O'Neill
walks up.]
O'NEILL
Hey.
JONAS
Colonel O'Neill. I'm surprised to see you.
O'NEILL
I brought a letter from my superior to your leaders.
JONAS
Ah. It's an apology?
[He hands the woman whatever they were looking at, and she walks away.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, hardly. You see, we know you're lying through your teeth.
JONAS
How is Dr. Jackson?
O'NEILL
Not good.
JONAS
I'm sorry to hear that. Two of the scientists in the room are
already dead, the other two will be shortly. Their deaths were
horrific.
O'NEILL
My superior thinks that denying the allegations against Daniel would
be a waste of time.
JONAS
He's a wise man. What I don't understand is why your government is
even trying to maintain a relationship with us.
O'NEILL
Because we want some of that stuff you're experimenting with. My
government still thinks they can negotiate for it.
JONAS
The naquadria is very spare and extremely valuable to us. I doubt
that my government would ever agree to that.
O'NEILL
Yeah, I figured. That's why I'm here.
JONAS
I don't understand.
O'NEILL
I only agreed to bring that letter so I could see you.
JONAS
Why?
O'NEILL
Because Daniel is dying.
JONAS
And you're looking for someone to blame?
O'NEILL
I'm not gonna let you tarnish his name. See, I don't care what that
stuff is worth, to anyone. My government will admit Daniel is guilty
over my dead body.
JONAS
What do you want from me?
O'NEILL
Just tell the truth.
JONAS
I can't. Even if I wanted to, without the support of the other
scientists...
O'NEILL
Look, we're only in this mess because you and your buddies are lying
cowards trying to cover your own incompetence.
JONAS
Colonel, we desperately need the weapon we're developing. Without
it, the Kelownan people could easily fall to our rival nations who
are developing their own powerful weapons as we speak. Now, we're
willing to do whatever's necessary to ensure our freedom and a
lasting peace on this planet.
O'NEILL
All right, let me be clear about something. I think this is the
point Daniel was trying to make. A weapon of mass destruction can
only be used for one thing. Now, you might think it will ensure
peace and freedom, but I guarantee you it'll never have the effect
you're hoping for until you use it, at least once. Now, just for the
record, the reason we want that stuff is because we think it could
be used to create defense shields. But you just go ahead, blow
yourselves to hell with it.
[O'Neill walks away.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[A nurse is changing Daniel's bandages. Carter is sitting in the
observation room, and Janet walks up behind her.]
CARTER
He looks awful.
FRAISER
It's gonna get a lot worse, and it's gonna happen fast.
CARTER
You sure you're doing everything you can?
FRAISER
Sedatives and painkillers, that's all we can really do. You have no
idea how painful this is going to get. You know, I would never
normally say this, it goes against everything I've been trained to
do, but the truth is he'd be a lot better off if I...
INT--SOMEWHERE IN THE SGC
[Carter keys open a safe and takes out the Goa'uld healing device she
got from Kendra on Cimmeria.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter enters Daniel's room while Hammond, O'Neill, and Teal'c watch
from the observation room.]
CARTER
Daniel, I didn't suggest this before because, well, the truth is,
I'm not really sure what I'm doing with this thing. I could make
things worse.
[Daniel nods. Carter looks at Janet, who gives her a tiny smile. Then
she holds the device over Daniel, closing her eyes in concentration,
and it begins to glow. For a moment it seems to be working, and then
Daniel goes into a seizure.]
FRAISER
He's seizing. Get the crash cart; give me five of Valium.
CARTER
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[Carter is moved out of the way.]
FRAISER
Help me get him on his side. Valium's in. Stand by with the ambu
bag, draw two grams of magnesium sulphate. Put him back, easy.
[We focus in on Daniel and the light around him slowly fades, cueing a
kind of internal dream sequence. Dream Daniel is dressed in blue BDUs,
walking from the dark back into the light. He finds himself in the Gate
Room, where a woman in white stands on the ramp.]
OMA
Your fate is in your hands.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel is now almost completely covered in bandages, including his
face. O'Neill enters the room and sits down beside the bed.]
DANIEL
Hey, Jack.
O'NEILL
Hey. I uh, I just wanted to... I'm really bad at this.
DANIEL
Yes, you are. I hear that Sam thinks the naquadria might be an
important discovery.
O'NEILL
Yeah, apparently. If we can get some. For what it's worth, I tried
to get your point across to Jonas.
DANIEL
He's in a tough position.
O'NEILL
You're not gonna take the fall for this. I don't care what's at
stake.
DANIEL
Why do you care?
O'NEILL
Because, despite the fact that you've been a terrific pain in the
ass for the last five years, I may have, might have, uh, grown to
admire you a little, I think.
DANIEL
Now that's touching.
O'NEILL
This will not be your last act on official record.

DANIEL
Right. What did you mean when you said my fate is in my hands?
OMA
When the mind is enlightened, the spirit is freed and the body
matters not.
DANIEL
You're talking about ascension, right? Rising to a different plane
of existence. Are you saying that I could do that? Become like you?
OMA
You must complete the journey you began at Kheb. Only then will you
be able to find your way to the Great Path.
DANIEL
What do I do?
OMA
Release your burden.
DANIEL
Okay, well, consider it released. What's Step Two?

A tall man cannot hide in the short grass.
DANIEL
You know, I really, I don't have time for one of these kind of

OMA
One cannot reach enlightenment by running from death.
DANIEL
Tell me what to do.
OMA
Many roads lead to the Great Path. Only the willing will find their
way.
DANIEL
Okay, well, I'm willing. So let's go. I mean, you know, do your

O'NEILL
What are you doing here?
JONAS
Your commander was kind enough to grant my passage. I brought this,
naquadria. Took as much as I could.
O'NEILL
Why?
JONAS
The data recorded during that accident demonstrated the potential
power of the weapon unlike anything collected previously. I really
don't know what was worse, seeing my colleagues die in the manner
they did, or seeing the looks of utter glee on our leaders' faces
when they were told the potential power of this weapon. They wanted
to know when it could be demonstrated. I told them the truth about
what happened.
FLASHBACK
INT--SAME KELOWNAN BUILDING
[Daniel and Jonas walk down the corridor towards the lab.]
JONAS
I read that book you gave me.
DANIEL
Already? I just gave it to you last night.
JONAS
Quick study. It's how I got this position at my age.
DANIEL
And--?
JONAS
It should prove useful in the translations.
DANIEL
I thought you'd be a little bit more excited.
JONAS
No offense, I'm just more interested in what's out there, through
the Stargate.
DANIEL
Well all I can say is whatever problems there are between your
planet's nations, they will seem insignificant when you do find out
what's going on out there.
JONAS
Till you give us more details, there's not much else I can do.
DANIEL
Well, whether you realize it or not, you've probably seen the
evidence right here on your own planet. The temple where you found
the Gate was obviously occupied by a powerful
technologically-advanced race. Now, as far as I can tell from the
pictures you've shown me, their civilization was destroyed by a
catastrophic explosion.
JONAS
Our scientists have theorised that an asteroid impacted our
continent ten thousand years ago. Now, the fallout from that could
have easily buried the civilization at that time.
DANIEL
Or the race that occupied the Gate were experimenting with the very
technology you are today and it resulted in disaster.
JONAS
If what you say is true about the potential enemies out there in our
galaxy, we may need these advanced weapons more than ever.
DANIEL
I can't deny that, but some very wise people have shown me first
hand how a sudden leap in weapons technology by a civilization
that's not ready for it can lead to its destruction.
[They reach the observation room, where Tomis is already watching the
other scientists work.]
JONAS
Given the chance, you would deny us this technology?
DANIEL
I can't predict what would happen to your people or your planet with
or without the weapon, I just wish there was another way.
[One of the scientists turns and talks to the observers.]
SCIENTIST
The energy readings are increasing by a power of ten.
TOMIS
Incredible.
[Suddenly, an energy wave radiates outwards from the device.]
SCIENTIST
Did you see that?
[One of the instruments in the lab starts registering an enormous burst
of energy. The core of the device starts collapsing into the device
itself, and another, larger energy wave radiates outwards. The
scientists all collapse, and alarms begin ringing.]
TOMIS
Get down! Stay away from the glass. The radiation will penetrate the
window.
JONAS
What's happening?
TOMIS
This device could explode.
[Some of the instruments in the lab begin sparking.]
SCIENTIST
We have to remove the core.
[He reaches up toward the device, as Jonas backs up against the wall of
the observation room and Tomis runs out.]
JONAS
Tomis!
[The scientist in the lab collapses back onto the floor. Daniel goes to
the other door, trying to get into the lab, but it's locked.]
JONAS
Dr Jackson!
[Frustrated, Daniel goes back to the center of the room, pulls out his
gun, and aims at the window.]
JONAS
No! Dr Jackson!
[Daniel shoots the glass full of holes to weaken it, then dives through
it into the lab. He goes to the device, intending to remove the core.
It's hot to the touch, so he pulls his jacket sleeve over his left
hand, then grabs the core and pulls it out. Afterward, he simply stands
there in the lab, a stunned look on his face. Jonas just looks down on
him.]

DANIEL
Yeah, yeah, a monk at Kheb said that to me. I didn't know what it
meant then and I still don't know now.
OMA
Why do you feel you have failed on your journey? You opened the
Stargate for your world.
DANIEL
I cracked the code, a lot of other people made it work.
OMA
The very next thing you did was help free the people of Abydos from
evil.
[Dream Daniel is holding a picture of Sha're, and it changes to a scene
from Children of the Gods where Daniel runs into the pyramid shouting
for Sha're.]
DANIEL
I had the chance to live out my life with her. I couldn't leave it
alone. I was the one that unburied the Gate. What happened to her
was my fault. I couldn't save Sha're, I couldn't save Sarah. Every
Goa'uld I helped eliminate, another one took its place. Maybe I did
something good every now and again, but nothing I've ever done seems
to have changed anything.
OMA
These tasks of which you speak were great challenges. Perhaps they
were even impossible to achieve.
DANIEL
Does that absolve me?
OMA
You feel your journey must continue until you have found redemption
for these failures?
DANIEL
No. Not anymore, not if I'm dead.
OMA
Exactly true.
DANIEL
You said I was the only one qualified to judge myself? So, how ever
much I want achievement enlightenment or whatever you want to call
it, what happens if I look at my life and I don't honestly believe I
deserve it?
OMA
The success or failure of your deeds does not add up to the sum of
your life. Your spirit cannot be weighed. Judge yourself by the
intention of your actions and by the strength with which you faced
the challenges that have stood in your way.
DANIEL
What if I can't?
OMA
The people closest to you have been trying to tell you that you have
made a difference. That you did change things for the better.
DANIEL
Not enough.
OMA
The universe is vast and we are so small. There is only one thing we
can ever truly control.
DANIEL
What's that?

Whether we are good or evil.

Unauthorized incoming wormhole.
HAMMOND
Wait here.
[Hammond and O'Neill head for the Control Room.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
DAVIS
Receiving Tok'ra IDC, sir.
HAMMOND
All defense teams on high alert.
DAVIS
High alert. Repeat, high alert.
[Soldiers enter the Gate Room and take positions facing the Stargate
with their weapons drawn.]
HAMMOND
Open the iris.
[The iris opens, and Jacob walks through.]
HAMMOND
Stand down.
[Jacob walks down the ramp and Hammond and O'Neill come to meet him.]
HAMMOND
Sorry about that, Jacob. Given what's been happening with the Tok'ra
lately, we had to be sure it was you.
JACOB
Understood. What's going on?
O'NEILL
It's Daniel.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Jacob, Hammond and O'Neill enter Daniel's room, where Carter and Janet
have taken up positions around the bed.]
JACOB
Hey, Sam. I'm so sorry.
[He hugs her.]
CARTER
I tried this, but it didn't work.
[She hands her father the healing device.]
JACOB
We'll do our best.
[Jacob activates the healing device for a moment, then stops.]
SELMAK
His condition is grave. I do not know if I can save him. And even if
I can, I do not believe I can restore his full healthy state.
CARTER
Do what you can.
[Jacob activates the healing device again.]
DREAM SEQUENCE
INT--DREAM GATE ROOM
[Oma is walking up the ramp towards the Stargate.]
DANIEL
You're leaving? You can't leave.
OMA
The rest is up to you.
DANIEL
Why, why me? Why, why give me this chance?
OMA
Anyone can reach enlightenment. Anyone prepared to open their mind
as you did when you first came to Kheb.
DANIEL
They're trying to save me. They're healing me, I can feel it.
OMA
Then your journey will continue as before.
DANIEL
What if I don't want it to? Not that way.
OMA
Walking the Great Path brings great responsibility. You cannot fear
it nor hesitate in your resolve.
DANIEL
I understand. I'm ready to go with you.
OMA
Then stop them.
DANIEL
How?
END DREAM SEQUENCE
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Jacob is still healing Daniel. Dream Daniel appears and walks around
the room, finally stopping next to O'Neill. He touches him on the
shoulder, and they both travel instantly into the Dream Gate Room.]

O'NEILL
Daniel?
DANIEL
Yeah.
O'NEILL
Did you want something?
DANIEL
Yeah. Tell Jacob to stop.
O'NEILL
Why?
DANIEL
Because I'm ready to move on.
O'NEILL
You just giving up?
DANIEL
No. No, I'm not giving up, believe me.
[They both look at Oma, who is standing silently on the ramp. She
changes into a glowing white being and goes to the Stargate,
disappearing into it and leaving behind an open wormhole.]
DANIEL
You remember Oma?
O'NEILL
Sure.
DANIEL
I think I can do more this way. It's what I want. I have to go now.
Everything's gonna be fine. Please, Jack. Tell Jacob to stop.
END DREAM SEQUENCE
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Jacob is still healing Daniel.]
O'NEILL
Jacob. Stop.
JACOB
Are you serious?
O'NEILL
It's what he wants.
[Jacob looks at Janet.]
JACOB
Someone else want to tell me what to do?
O'NEILL
Just let him go.
[Jacob stops. Daniel exhales heavily, and the EKG flatlines.]
FRAISER
Colonel?!
[Daniel's body suddenly starts to glow, and he begins to ascend toward
the ceiling as everyone watches.]

DANIEL
I'm gonna miss you guys.
O'NEILL
Yeah, you too.
DANIEL
Thank you. For everything.
O'NEILL
So, what? See you around?
DANIEL
I don't know.
[Daniel turns and walks up the ramp.]
O'NEILL
Hey... where are you going?
DANIEL
I don't know.
[Daniel walks through the Gate and disappears as O'Neill watches.]
END DREAM SEQUENCE
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel ascends through the ceiling, and we close on O'Neill's face.]
