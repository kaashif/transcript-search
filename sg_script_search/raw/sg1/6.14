Oh, and what are you going to do?
O'NEILL
Well, I was thinking about shooting you.

one brown eye looks down the scope. Through the scope he can see Kinsey
moving below him. He squeezes his hand around the trigger. Through the
scope, he can see Kinsey pause by the limousine and wave one final time
to the crowd. The assassin fires.]

[A shot rings out. Kinsey crumbles, clutching his chest. The crowd
ducks, some people start yelling and screaming. The Secret Service

OPENING CREDITS
INT--JONAS'S OFFICE
[On a television screen, a female reporter stands outside the
Washington hotel where Kinsey was shot. "Live Report" is written on the
screen below her.]
TV NEWS REPORTER
(through television)
The assassination of Senator Kinsey has sent shockwaves through
Washington. With his party's national convention just weeks away,
the Senator was considered by many to be their most likely choice
for the second spot on the presidential ticket.
[Jonas, Carter, and Teal'c all surround the television, watching the
news. O'Neill enters. He is wearing casual, civilian clothes and looks
relaxed.]
TV NEWS REPORTER
(continuing)
Political maneuvering has already...
O'NEILL
Hey. I'm back. What'd I miss?
[Carter mutes the television with the remote and stands, slightly
puzzled at O'Neill's demeanor.]
CARTER
Sir, Senator Kinsey is dead. He was shot.
O'NEILL
(shocked)
What?
JONAS
Yeah. It's been all over the news for three days.
O'NEILL
(still processing the news)
I've been on vacation.
CARTER
It looks like it was a professional hit. The shooter took him out
from a hotel room across the street and then just disappeared.
O'NEILL
Any suspects?
CARTER
(shaking head)
Police aren't saying anything.
TEAL'C
It is reasonable to assume that a man in Senator Kinsey's position
would have a great many enemies.
[O'Neill acknowledges the comment and appears about to speak, but is
interrupted by Hammond entering, flanked by two SFs.]
HAMMOND
Colonel?
O'NEILL
General?
HAMMOND
I'm sorry to have to do this, but these men are here to escort you
to Peterson. From there you'll be flown to Andrews and then turned
over to the civilian authorities in Washington.
[SG-1 are confused as they look back and forth between the guards and
Hammond.]
CARTER
Sir, what is this?
HAMMOND
Colonel O'Neill is under arrest for the murder of Senator Kinsey.
O'NEILL
(shocked)
What!?!
[The rest of SG-1 look equally shocked.]
SF
You'll have to come with us, sir.
O'NEILL
(indignant)
I don't think so.
HAMMOND
Colonel...
O'NEILL
(protesting)
General, I've been on vacation!
HAMMOND
(calmly)
I believe you, Jack. But for the moment, we're going to have to
cooperate.
[O'Neill still looks shocked.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter, Teal'c, and Jonas follow Hammond up the circular stairwell
into the room.]
CARTER
There's no way Colonel O'Neill could've done this.
HAMMOND
I'm aware of that, Major, but my hands are tied.
JONAS
How could they possible think that he was responsible? He wasn't
even in Washington!
DAVIS
Actually, it looks like he was.
[Major Davis is waiting at the table, several papers and a remote
control in front of him.]
HAMMOND
Major Davis is acting as liaison between the Pentagon and the
District Attorney. He has a report for us. Major?
DAVIS
Thank you, sir.
[Hammond and the three members of SG-1 take seats around the briefing
room table. Davis clicks the remote, and black and white surveillance
footage starts running on the screen.]
DAVIS
This was taken from a security camera in a hotel across the street
from where the shooting occurred just a couple of minutes after it
happened.
[The video displays a familiar figure moving down the building
stairwell. Davis pauses the video when there is a clear image of the
assassin's face. It shows O'Neill.]
DAVIS
Now, the trajectory of the bullet indicates that the shot did in
fact come from this hotel.
JONAS
(pointing at video)
That doesn't prove anything.
DAVIS
No, but based on this evidence, the FBI obtained warrants to search
both the Colonel's house...and his cabin. Now, they didn't find
anything, but one of the neighbors told them that they saw Colonel
O'Neill dumping something down by the lake. They sent down a diver,
who came up with this.
[Davis opens a file and hands Hammond an 8x10 photograph of the
assassin's case and dismantled rifle. Hammond hands the photograph to
Carter.]
DAVIS
Ballistics match it with the bullet that killed Senator Kinsey.
[Carter rolls her eyes and hands the photograph over to Jonas. He and
Teal'c look equally skeptical.]
DAVIS
I don't know what else to say, sir. Certainly no secret that there
was bad blood between them.
CARTER
Oh, come on. They had a few run-ins. That's hardly a motive for
murder.
JONAS
Okay, I've read the file on Kinsey, but it is a little vague.
HAMMOND
The Senator was involved with a group of individuals who were
unhappy with the way Stargate Command was being run.
CARTER
They tried to blackmail General Hammond into resigning. Colonel
O'Neill found evidence connecting Kinsey to their illegal activities
and threatened to go public with it unless he got them to back off.
JONAS
So, technically, Kinsey was protecting the SGC.
CARTER
(shrugging)
True, but I don't think he was very happy about it.
JONAS
Still, that's not a motive to kill the guy; that's a motive to keep
him alive!
TEAL'C
Unfortunately, we can divulge none of this information to the
civilian authorities.
[Jonas sighs and shakes his head.]
HAMMOND
Senator Kinsey was shot in broad daylight on a public street in
front of dozens of civilian witnesses. If we tried to ship this to a
military court, it would be a political disaster for the current
administration.
CARTER
With all due respect, sir, the "current administration" owes a lot
to the Colonel.
HAMMOND
I'm aware of that, Major, as is the President. Unfortunately,
there's nothing he can do for Colonel O'Neill at this time. On the
other hand, I'm not a politician, which is why I'm suspending SG-1's
offworld duties and assigning the three of you to get to the bottom
of this. You have the full resources of this command at your
disposal.
CARTER
Thank you, sir.
HAMMOND
Dismissed.
[Everyone except Davis rises and leaves the room. Davis looks at the
image of O'Neill on the video screen.]
EXT--PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAY
INT--FEDERAL PRISON
[Teal'c and Jonas, both dressed in green BDUs, Teal'c with a black
stocking cap on his head, stand waiting in a visiting room. A door
buzzes open and a shackled O'Neill is led in by SFs. He wears blue
prison garb.]
JONAS
Colonel.
[O'Neill gives a small humorless smile and continues in. The guards
exit.]
JONAS
How are you...doing?
O'NEILL
(bitterly)
I'm accused of a murder I didn't commit. How do you think I'm
"doing"?
[O'Neill sits at a table. Jonas and Teal'c sit across from him.]
JONAS
When are you supposed to get transferred to Washington?
O'NEILL
Couple of days.
TEAL'C
General Hammond has suspended our offworld duties in order that we
may investigate this situation further.
[O'Neill nods.]
JONAS
Unfortunately, it's not going very well.
TEAL'C
There is evidence that places you at the scene of the shooting.
O'NEILL
(forcefully)
I was fishing!
[Teal'c accepts this explanation calmly. Jonas shifts in his seat.]
O'NEILL
Look, Kinsey wasn't exactly my best buddy, and on occasion, I felt
like beating the crap out of him, but I didn't kill him.
JONAS
They...somehow have a video that clearly places you in Washington,
D.C. three days ago.
O'NEILL
(shaking head and muttering)
I don't believe this.
JONAS
We know you've been on secret missions before. We're not always
privy to the details--
O'NEILL
(angrily interrupting)
I wasn't on a mission, Jonas. I was in Minnesota! On vacation!
TEAL'C
Did you encounter anyone that could verify your story?
O'NEILL
I was twenty miles away from the closest town. Alone. That was the
point!
[Teal'c and Jonas exchange looks as O'Neill shifts, clearly
frustrated.]
TEAL'C
Perhaps this is all part of an elaborate plan, and those responsible
chose to act at a time when they knew you would have no alibi.
[O'Neill considers this and looks at Teal'c.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter, Jonas, and Teal'c brief Hammond.]
CARTER
I checked the videotape to see if it had been doctored, but it
appears to be genuine.
JONAS
So either that really is Colonel O'Neill, or someone who happens to
look exactly like him.
TEAL'C
We have encountered duplicating technology before.
CARTER
I was thinking the exact same thing, but those mimic devices are
under heavy guard.
JONAS
(confused)
Mimic devices? Someone want to fill me in?
[Carter and Teal'c look to Hammond. He sighs and turns back to Jonas.]
HAMMOND
Three years ago, we had a foothold situation here at the SGC. Aliens
gained control by using mimic devices to impersonate and replace
base personnel, including myself.
JONAS
(surprised)
Why haven't I heard about this before?
HAMMOND
Because of the seriousness of the security breach, a decision was
made to erase all mention of the incident from official records.
[Jonas nods and takes in this information.]
JONAS
Well, where are these devices now?
CARTER
Area 51.
INT--AREA 51 STORAGE ROOM
[Infrared sensors cross horizontally over several rows of individually
locked drawers. The door to the room buzzes and Carter, wearing her
Class A uniform, and a scientist in a lab coat are let in by a guard.]
CARTER
How many do you have?
SCIENTIST
We recovered twelve from the SGC. They're all stored here.
[The scientist places her hand on a palm scanner.]
CARTER
Has anyone been studying them recently?
SCIENTIST
We've all been working on the X-303.
[The palm scanner completes its analysis and the infrared sensors shut
down. The scientist leads Carter to one of the drawers. The scientist
punches in a numeric combination and presses her thumb to the control.
It scans her thumb and opens the drawer. Twelve mimic devices sit in
foam.]
SCIENTIST
There we go, all present and accounted for.
[Carter picks up one of the devices and studies it.]
INT--PRISON, PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE
[Carter sets the device down on the table in front of O'Neill. She
remains dressed in her Class A uniform. Jonas sits by her side in green
BDUs.]
CARTER
It's a fake. All the mimic devices were switched.
O'NEILL
Someone duplicated the duplicators?
CARTER
The last recorded test of those devices was six months ago. They
could've been taken any time after that.
JONAS
There has got to be some way that we can use this to clear you.
O'NEILL
I don't think the "alien technology defense" is gonna fly.
JONAS
If I'm understanding this correctly, there is someone walking around
out there that can make himself look exactly like you at the push of
a button! That's gotta be relevant!
CARTER
It's classified information, Jonas. But...we can use it to find the
real assassin...maybe.
[She and O'Neill exchange a sober look.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--JONAS'S OFFICE
[Jonas holds up a mimic device. Carter and Teal'c stand across the
counter from him.]
JONAS
So, how do these things work?
CARTER
Well, it's a two part process. First you take somebody and pass them
through a large scanning device, which then uploads their exact
image into a holographic sequencer.
JONAS
(holds up device)
Which looks like this.
CARTER
Exactly. Then you place that sequencer somewhere on your body and
activate it. You instantly take on the appearance of the person you
scanned.
TEAL'C
Was the scanning device taken?
CARTER
No, it's still at Area 51. We checked it out.
JONAS
So, whoever did this can only impersonate a limited number of
people.
CARTER
Twelve, to be precise, including Colonel O'Neill, Doctor Fraiser,
and Daniel.
JONAS
What about General Hammond?
CARTER
The alien impersonating him was trapped in the Gate room along with
several others. They activated some kind self-destruct and blew
themselves up. In case you're wondering, Teal'c and I were never
scanned.
JONAS
That's good to know.
CARTER
I requested all the personnel files on everyone who had access to
these devices. I'd like the two of you to check them out.
[Teal'c nods.]
JONAS
What about you?
CARTER
(taking a deep breath)
I'm going to Washington. I need to look up an old acquaintance.
EXT--WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY

CARTER
I'm Major Carter. I'm here to see Agent Barrett.
[The woman leads her to Barrett's office.]
INT--BARRETT'S OFFICE
BARRETT
Major Carter. I was wondering how long it would be before you came
by. Welcome to NID headquarters.
INT--JONAS'S OFFICE
[Jonas studies a computer screen. Teal'c is nearby.]
JONAS
In three years, only eight people at Area 51 had authorized access
to the mimic devices.
TEAL'C
We must speak to them all.
JONAS
Most of them have been transferred to the X-303 project, so they're
still living in Nevada. Wait a minute, here's something.
[The computer screen locks on one of the personnel files. Dr. Brent
Langham's detailed information scrolls across the screen.]
JONAS
Dr. Brent Langham.
TEAL'C
(troubled)
Deceased.
JONAS
Killed in an automobile accident three weeks ago.
TEAL'C
Given the circumstance, that would appear to be a highly unlikely
coincidence.
INT--BARRETT'S OFFICE
BARRETT
What exactly are you implying here, Major? That the NID had a hand
in the assassination of a U.S. Senator?
CARTER
Very few organizations have the resources to pull off something like
this.
BARRETT
And the man accused of the crime happens to belong to one of them.
CARTER
(barely keeping her temper)
The SGC is not behind this.
BARRETT
Senator Kinsey was no friend of the Stargate Command. In fact, he
tried to take you down more than once.
CARTER
We don't engage in criminal activity, Agent Barrett, which is more
than I can say for the NID.
BARRETT
If you're referring to the Prometheus incident, that was
orchestrated by a handful of rogue agents.
CARTER
What about Steveston, Oregon? You sat by and watched while the
Goa'uld took over an entire town of innocent civilians.
BARRETT
That was an officially sanctioned operation...that would've
succeeded if it wasn't for your interference.
CARTER
(incredulous)
Are you kidding me!?! Your agents were compromised, and your
organization was about to be infiltrated!
[Barrett reaches over and takes a small piece of notepaper. He begins
to write on it while continuing to speak to her.]
BARRETT
Look, Major, the videotape of Colonel O'Neill clearly places him at
the scene of the crime. And the murder weapon was found near his
cabin. So, if you'll excuse me...
[Barrett slides the note over to Carter. On it he has written: "Stanton
Park 3 PM". Carter looks at the note, then back at Barrett.]
BARRETT
...I've got work to do.
[Carter nods in acknowledgment, then leaves.]
EXT--STANTON PARK, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY (3 PM)
[Barrett sits on a park bench, reading a newspaper. Carter, now dressed
in casual clothes, approaches and sits next to him.]
BARRETT
(still reading paper)
You know, it says here that by 2075, the Earth's oceans will be too
warm to sustain most coral reefs, and once they're gone, the entire
ecosystem of the planet will collapse.
CARTER
That's a cheerful thought.
BARRETT
We spend all of our time trying to protect the world from the
Goa'uld. Maybe we should worry a little more about protecting it
from ourselves.
CARTER
What are we doing out here, Agent Barrett?
BARRETT
My office is bugged. It's standard procedure to record all
conversations that take place in NID headquarters. What I'm about to
tell you, Major, nobody else can know, especially my superiors.
CARTER
What are you talking about?
[Barrett puts down the newspaper and looks at her earnestly.]
BARRETT
There's a cancer at the NID, a shadow organization that operates
outside the law. It's time they were exposed for who they really
are.
CARTER
(nodding)
I agree.
BARRETT
The Prometheus incident, that was the last straw. After that, I was
called to the White House for an assignment.
CARTER
What does this have to do with Colonel O'Neill?
BARRETT
Senator Kinsey was working for me. He was about to give me enough
evidence to bring down the entire leadership of the shadow group.
CARTER
How did you convince him to do that?
BARRETT
Let's just say I know about a few of the skeletons in the Senator's
closet...and it is an election year.
[Carter makes a disgusted face and nods.]
CARTER
You blackmailed him.
BARRETT
I'll do whatever it takes to bring these people down, Major.
[Carter looks over at Barrett and does a double take at the conviction
in Barrett's expression.]
[Some time passes, and now Barrett and Carter are walking through the
park.]
CARTER
So who else knows about this?
BARRETT
As of this moment, the President, a few members of his staff, and
you.
CARTER
You're working alone?
BARRETT
The smaller the operation, the less chance of it being compromised.
You have no idea how far the corruption goes, Major. Not even the
SGC is immune.
CARTER
Then you're taking a big risk talking to me.
BARRETT
I need your help. Besides, I think there's more that you're not
telling me. I mean, you've seen the evidence against Colonel
O'Neill. What makes you so sure that he's innocent?
CARTER
When you work with someone that long, you just know.
BARRETT
No, there's something more than that. There's something you're not
telling me.
CARTER
Your job requires you to be suspicious of everybody, even your
coworkers. Where I come from, we trust each other with our lives
every day. Maybe that's something you can't understand.
BARRETT
Well, I guess it's never to late to learn.
[Carter pauses and she and Barrett exchange looks.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Jonas stands before a computer screen. Detailed images of the mimic
devices appear on the video screen behind him. Teal'c, Fraiser, and
Hammond sit at the table.]
JONAS
When the mimic devices were first brought to Area 51, a team of
eight scientists was assigned to study them. The Pentagon was hoping
to be able to adapt the devices for use in the field. However, while
the original holographic images that were created by the aliens
seemed to last indefinitely, those that were created by the
scientists in the lab were only sustainable for three to four
minutes at a time due to problems with electromagnetic interference.
So the project was scaled back, and five of the original team
members were reassigned. The remaining three were Dr. Singh, Dr.
Healey, and this fellow...Dr. Brent Langham.
[Jonas clicks the remote, and Dr. Langham's personnel file appears on
the screen, including a head shot of him. He is a dark haired man.]
JONAS
(continuing)
They continued working on the devices for another six months with no
new breakthroughs. Finally, the entire project was shut down, and
uh, Dr. Healey and Dr. Singh were transferred to the X-303 project.
HAMMOND
And Dr. Langham?
JONAS
He was supposedly killed in a car crash two days before the transfer
was due to take effect.
FRAISER
The body was burned beyond recognition. He was identified through
dental records. But...the coroner missed something. Toxicology
report came back clean, no signs of any drugs or alcohol in the
victim's blood.
HAMMOND
Why is that unusual?
FRAISER
Well, Dr. Langham was epileptic. His condition required him to take
regular doses of anti-convulsant drugs. There should've been traces
of those drugs in his blood.
TEAL'C
The dental records were falsified. The body recovered at the crash
site was someone else.
HAMMOND
So you're saying this Dr. Langham took the mimic devices and
engineered his own disappearance?
JONAS
Or someone engineered it for him.
FRAISER
Okay, are we suggesting then that this scientist shot Kinsey?
JONAS
I doubt it. He didn't have any para-military training.
TEAL'C
Perhaps Dr. Langham merely provided the mimic devices for a fee.
FRAISER
Well, then he can lead us to whoever was responsible.
HAMMOND
I don't care what it takes, I want you to find this Dr. Langham.
JONAS
Yes, sir.
EXT--WAREHOUSE, WASHINGTON, D.C., AREA, DAY
[Carter and Barrett drive a sedan up to the warehouse. Carter turns off
the ignition and turns to Barrett.]
CARTER
Okay...what is this?
BARRETT
The rifle used to kill Senator Kinsey was not the kind of thing you
could pick up at your local sporting goods' store. This is a one
stop shop for unregistered weapons. High-end merchandise,
professional clientele. There's a good chance our shooter was here.
[They exit the car and head towards the door.]
CARTER
If you know they're selling illegal guns, why don't you shut them
down?
BARRETT
I allow them to operate in exchange for information. Sometimes,
you've gotta cross the line, Major. You've just gotta know when to
step back.
[Barrett waves to a security camera outside the warehouse and the
continue walking.]
INT--WAREHOUSE
[A well muscled man opens the door for Barrett and Carter.]
BARRETT
Hey, Leo.
CARTER
(more cautious)
Leo.
[They enter the warehouse, filled with various munitions and military
style hardware. Against the back wall are several targets. They and the
wall show evidence of several practice firings. Several other well
muscled men stand guard throughout the warehouse. Barrett and Carter
walk towards a desk and take seats. Barrett is calm, but Carter is
wary. The munitions dealer, Luthor, is already seated behind it.]
LUTHOR
Agent Barrett. When are you going to get yourself a new suit?
BARRETT
(unphased)
Black is good for any occasion.
LUTHOR
(dryly)
Yeah, it's also thinning. Who's your friend?
CARTER
Major Samantha Carter, United States Air Force.
BARRETT
We can talk in front of her.
LUTHOR
What can I do for you?
BARRETT
We want to know about a 700 with a customized break down stock.
LUTHOR
Yeah? I moved one last week.
CARTER
(righteously)
Well, in all likelihood, the weapon you sold was used to assassinate
a United States Senator.
LUTHOR
(smirking)
What's your point?
[Carter is irritated by his nonchalance.]
BARRETT
Was the buyer a regular customer?
LUTHOR
Nah, I never seen him before.
[Barrett pulls out a picture from his coat. It is the surveillance
camera footage showing O'Neill in the hotel stairwell.]
BARRETT
Is that the guy?
LUTHOR
That's the guy.
[Carter closes her eyes. Barrett looks over at her expectantly. Carter
looks away, and the guns on display catch her attention.]
CARTER
Did he look at any other weapons besides the 700?
LUTHOR
Yeah, as a matter of fact, he did.
[Luthor nods to Leo, who picks up a weapon from its display mount.]
LUTHOR
A sound-suppressed revolver rifle.
CARTER
Did he handle it?
LUTHOR
Sure.
CARTER
Was he wearing gloves?
LUTHOR
(smiling and shaking his head)
No.
BARRETT
Has anybody handled it since?
LUTHOR
No, just Leo here.
CARTER
(swallowing her distaste)
How much?
[Luthor smiles.]
INT--CARTER'S HOTEL ROOM, WASHINGTON, D.C.
[Carter and Barrett study a computer display comparing the partial and
whole prints lifted off the rifle with those of O'Neill. The computer
analysis concludes with no match for either print.]
CARTER
There's one full set of prints and one partial on the second rifle,
but neither of them match Colonel O'Neill.
BARRETT
(nonplussed)
It's a little strange.
CARTER
Well, assuming that full set matches our friend Leo, that would mean
the partial belongs to our shooter.
BARRETT
Maybe.
CARTER
(irritated)
It's the best lead we have.
BARRETT
The shooter probably won't have a criminal record. In fact, there's
a good chance he may not exist on any database at all.
CARTER
Except maybe NID personnel files.
[Barrett looks uncomfortable. Carter turns to face him directly and
shrugs.]
CARTER
You said it yourself, Agent Barrett. There's a cancer in your
organization. Kinsey was gonna to bring them down, so they had him
killed. So, did they hire an outside contractor, or use one of their
own?
[Barrett looks grave, then nods towards the computer.]
BARRETT
Give me the disk.
[Carter hands him a floppy disk with the information.]
BARRETT
I'll check the files and call you in a couple hours.
[He starts to leave, then pauses just outside the hotel room door.]
BARRETT
Good call, checking for a second weapon.
CARTER
Thanks.
BARRETT
You're welcome.
[Barrett leaves.]
INT--JONAS'S OFFICE
[Fraiser is typing on Jonas's computer as Teal'c and Jonas stand
nearby.]
JONAS
So where do we start?
TEAL'C
It is probable that Dr. Langham has assumed a new identity.
JONAS
Yeah, new name, new address, new social security number.
FRAISER
He can't change his medical condition.
TEAL'C
Do not many thousands of people in this country suffer from this
affliction?
FRAISER
Yes, but there's a wide range of treatment that vary from case to
case. See, Dr. Langham was on a very specific combination of drugs,
including Primadone and Carbamazepine, so we can access the national
pharmaceutical database and focus on new prescriptions written in
the past three weeks. We then cross reference that with age and
gender, and we should be able to narrow down the field.
[Teal'c nods in acknowledgment.]
EXT--RESIDENTIAL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY

They think he may have been the one who took the mimic devices.
EXT--RESIDENTIAL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY
CARTER
Well, if it turns out the shooter was NID, we should be able to
track him using the fingerprints we found on the second rifle.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
What about this Agent Barrett? Are you sure you can trust him?
EXT--RESIDENTIAL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY
CARTER
(pausing)
I don't know. I think so.
HAMMOND
(over phone)
You know you're not authorized to tell him about the foothold
incident.
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
HAMMOND
(continuing)
Technically, I shouldn't have even told Jonas.
CARTER
(over phone)
I know, sir. I'm hoping it won't come to that.
EXT--RESIDENTIAL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY
CARTER
(continuing)
I'll keep you posted, sir.
[Carter hangs up as Barrett gets in the passenger seat.]
CARTER
So?
BARRETT
You were right. The prints match an NID agent named Mark Devlin.
[Barrett opens a folder and shows Carter a file with Devlin's name
paper clipped to the top. He is a bearded man who looks nothing like
O'Neill. Carter glances at it and starts the engine.]
EXT--RESIDENTIAL STREET, UNKNOWN LOCATION, DAY
[Teal'c and Jonas pull up to a small grey house on a residential
street. They get out and approach the front door. Both are wearing
civilian, casual clothes. Teal'c wears a black, brimmed hat. Jonas
carries a clipboard.]
JONAS
How'd you learn to drive?
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson instructed me.
JONAS
When was that?
TEAL'C
I believe the year was 1969.
[They reach the front door and knock. A blond man answers the door.]
SWIDEL
Can I help you?
[Jonas checks his clipboard. Attached is a picture of Langham and a
list of ten names, three of which are already crossed off. David Swidel
is the fourth name on the list. The dark haired Langham looks nothing
like Swidel.]
JONAS
Yeah, we're looking for a Mr. David Swidel.
SWIDEL
Yeah, that's me. What's this about?
TEAL'C
Our apologies. You are not the man we are looking for.
[Swidel shrugs and starts to close the door.]
JONAS
(looking confused)
Sorry, we must have made a mistake...er...have a good day.
[Jonas waves. Swidel returns the wave and closes the door. Jonas and
Teal'c start to walk back to their car. Jonas shakes his head, still
looking confused.]
JONAS
That guy look familiar to you?
TEAL'C
He did not.
JONAS
Really? God, he looked familiar to me.
[Jonas pauses halfway to car. Teal'c also stops.]
JONAS
No. Wait, wait, wait. I know that guy. When I first came to Stargate
Command, he was one of the airmen in the Gate room. I'm positive.
[Jonas jogs back to the front door and knocks again.]
JONAS
Mr. Swidel! Mr Swidel!
[Teal'c attempts to open the front door with no success.]
JONAS
Around back.
[Jonas heads to the back of the house. Teal'c moves in another
direction.]
[Swidel heads out the patio door of his home and vaults over the deck
railing. He runs across the back yard and starts to climb the fence.
Jonas rounds the corner of the house and begins to give chase. He too
climbs over the fence. Both now begin running down the street behind
the row of homes. Swidel turns around to check on Jonas's progress. He
passes a black van parked in the road. As Swidel reaches the back of
the vehicle, Teal'c, behind the vehicle, shoves out his fist, knocking
Swidel to the pavement.]
SWIDEL
Whoah!
[Swidel is knocked unconscious by the blow and/or hitting the street.
Jonas slows to a stop beside the pair.]
JONAS
Nice shot.
[Teal'c barely spares a glance at Jonas before reaching down to Swidel.
He pulls open his shirt to reveal a mimic device. Teal'c pulls off the
device, and the unconscious Swidel morphs back into Langham.]
JONAS
Dr. Langham, I presume.
TEAL'C
Indeed.
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond reads a folder and moves to sit at the table. Teal'c and Jonas
are already seated there.]
HAMMOND
You found Dr. Langham.
JONAS
(nodding)
He's in a holding cell on Level Sixteen.
HAMMOND
Well done. Has he said anything?
JONAS
No, sir. We're letting him sweat, but he did ask for a lawyer.
HAMMOND
That could be a problem. We're not exactly following proper
procedure here.
JONAS
Sir, this guy stole top secret material and is an accessory to
murder!
TEAL'C
(forcefully)
Dr. Langham is also the only one that can verify Colonel O'Neill's
innocence.
HAMMOND
Not necessarily. Major Carter and Agent Barrett are pursuing a lead
that may take them to the real assassin.
JONAS
And if it doesn't?
HAMMOND
I know you how feel. No one wants Colonel O'Neill back more than I
do, but this is a delicate situation. I understand this man had some
injuries when you brought him in.
[Hammond points to a few lines in the file and pushes it to Teal'c.
Teal'c pauses and exchanges a look with Jonas.]
TEAL'C
Dr. Langham was reluctant to accompany us back to the SGC. He
required some convincing.
HAMMOND
All I'm saying is, we have to be careful. We're operating way
outside our jurisdiction, and like it or not, this man has rights.
TEAL'C
He will volunteer the information. Of that, I am certain.
[Hammond studies Teal'c. Teal'c raises one eyebrow.]
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL, LEVEL 16
[Langham sits at a table in the darkened room. He nervously looks
behind him at the SF on guard. He sees a shadow of someone pass by the
window of his cell door. There is a buzz, and the door opens. Langham
swallows and straightens up as Teal'c ominously enters the room. Teal'c
clenches his jaw and studies Langham, then slowly takes a seat, folding
his hands together and resting them on the table.]
LANGHAM
(nervously)
Look, this is a waste of time. I've got nothing to say.
[Teal'c does not respond. After a pause...]
LANGHAM
(swallowing)
Okay, yes, I took the mimic devices. I switched them with the fakes,
but I didn't know what they were planning to do.
[Teal'c does not respond.]
LANGHAM
What? You think I'm part of some kind of murder conspiracy? Well,
you're wrong.
[Langham weakly attempts a defiant expression. Teal'c's chair creaks as
he leans closer to Langham. Langham looks away and swallows again.]
LANGHAM
All right, I'll tell you what I know, but you have to promise me
protection.
[Teal'c does not respond.]
EXT--RESIDENTIAL STREET NEAR DEVLIN'S HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY
[Carter and Barrett pull up to Devlin's house. Agent Devlin is inside
the home and sees them through the window. He moves away with a
concerned expression. Barrett and Carter get out of the car and start
towards the house, readying their sidearms. Carter knocks, but there is
no answer.]
CARTER
I'll get us in.
[Carter pulls out her lock picking kit and starts to work at it.
Barrett nervously looks around, then impatiently kicks open the door.
Carter rolls her eyes and follows him inside, pocketing her lock
picks.]
INT--DEVLIN'S HOUSE
[Carter and Barrett scan the rooms of the house. It is empty. When they
reach the kitchen they see several canisters of gasoline attached to a
timer which is counting down from seven seconds. Carter grabs Barrett's
arm, and they run out of the house.]
EXT--OUTSIDE DEVLIN'S HOUSE, DAY
[The counter reaches zero and the house explodes, knocking Barrett and
Carter to the ground. Carter rolls onto her back to find Barrett
halfway on top of her.]
CARTER
(dangerously)
What are you doing?
BARRETT
Covering you.
CARTER
(with a biting edge to her tone)
Thank you. Get up.
BARRETT
Right.
[Barrett moves aside and they both look at the house, completely
engulfed in flames.]
INT--SGC HOLDING CELL, LEVEL 16
[Hammond and Jonas have joined Teal'c in Langham's cell.]
JONAS
When you first switched the devices with the fakes, where'd you take
them?
LANGHAM
Washington. They wanted me to take them myself because they thought
using middlemen would be too risky.
TEAL'C
To whom are you referring?
LANGHAM
They call themselves the Committee. They run the whole show.
HAMMOND
We're going to need names.
[Langham does not respond.]
HAMMOND
You're looking at conspiracy to commit murder.
LANGHAM
I didn't know they were going to use the devices to kill anybody!
They told me that they were going to analyze the technology for
possible commercial applications.
JONAS
Why would you believe that?
LANGHAM
(caustically)
You don't think money has anything to do with this? In the last six
months, there have been at least ten new patents that can be traced
back directly to Area 51. I'm talking industrial chemicals,
metallurgy, computers, you name it.
JONAS
So...they're selling alien technology?
LANGHAM
No. They're buying it! The members of the Committee aren't spies or
secret agents, they're businessmen. The rogue NID agents work for
them. They've got hundreds of millions invested, and they expect to
make billions in return by incorporating alien advancements into
their product lines.
[Hammond contemplates this information.]
JONAS
I thought this was about protecting the planet.
LANGHAM
Well, nobody said it had to be a non-profit business.
HAMMOND
Give us the names, and we'll ensure your safety.
LANGHAM
(scoffing)
Ho. Well. I'm going to need a few more details. You work for the Air
Force. You don't have a witness protection program!
JONAS
But we do have the Stargate.
[Langham blinks.]
LANGHAM
What do you mean?
HAMMOND
Well, if these people are as powerful as you say they are, there's
probably nowhere on Earth you'd be safe. Fortunately, we have other
options.
INT--CARTER'S HOTEL ROOM, WASHINGTON, D.C.
[Carter unlocks her door. She and Barrett enter, both covered in soot
and generally disheveled.]
BARRETT
All right, we need to talk. Who else knows about this operation at
Stargate Command?
CARTER
Why?
[Carter disarms and goes into the bathroom.]
BARRETT
Because we've got a leak, Major.
CARTER
(protesting)
Oh, wait a minute.
BARRETT
Agent Devlin was waiting for us. That means somebody obviously
tipped him off.
[Carter comes out of the bathroom wiping her face and neck with a wet
washcloth.]
CARTER
Not necessarily. Think about it. You used a computer to access those
personnel files, right? Maybe somebody tracked you.
[Carter's cell phone rings.]
BARRETT
Don't-don't answer that.
[Carter looks at the phone display.]
CARTER
It's General Hammond.
BARRETT
If they think we're dead, it may be our only advantage.
CARTER
You trust me, you trust my team.
[Carter answers the phone and sits on her bed. Barrett opens the mini
fridge and pulls out a couple of bottles of water.]
CARTER
(into phone)
Sir, what's happened?...Did he talk?...No, that's great news...Yes,
sir. Understood.
[Carter hangs up.]
BARRETT
(who had overheard)
What is it?
CARTER
We've got the names of those responsible for the assassination.
BARRETT
What's that supposed to mean?
CARTER
We have an inside source.
BARRETT
Who?
CARTER
(hesitating)
I can't.
BARRETT
This assignment came from the White House, Major. If you don't tell
me what I need to know, I'm gonna have to make a phone call. You're
the one who's always talking about trust.
[He hands her a water bottle and opens his own. Carter takes a drink
from hers and pauses, coming to a decision.]
CARTER
The man who shot Kinsey...was using a piece of alien technology--a
device capable of creating a flawless holographic disguise, in this
case a duplicate image of Colonel O'Neill. It was a perfect plan to
get rid of Kinsey and the Colonel at the same time.
BARRETT
Wait a minute. Why-why have I never heard about this technology
before?
CARTER
We encountered the devices three years ago during the foothold
situation. It was a close one. Kinsey was trying to shut down the
Stargate program for being too risky, so the whole thing was covered
up by Presidential order.
BARRETT
Who's your source?
CARTER
A scientist at Area 51. He's the one who smuggled the devices out.
BARRETT
(shaking his head)
That's not enough.
CARTER
They're onto us, Agent Barrett! If we don't move fast, they're going
to disappear.
BARRETT
We need more than the testimony of one scientist who made a deal for
immunity.
CARTER
That's all we have.
[Barrett pauses and looks away.]
CARTER
What?
BARRETT
Senator Kinsey's not dead, he's in a coma. We've got him under
twenty-four hour guard.
CARTER
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
BARRETT
Because we needed to keep his condition a secret for his protection.
If and when he regains consciousness, he'll be able to provide us
with the information we need to bring these people down.
CARTER
So we were both keeping secrets.
BARRETT
(shrugging)
That's the way the game is played.
CARTER
You've got a...
[Carter gestures on her face where Barrett has a large soot smudge on
his. She hands him the washcloth. He wipes at the smudge.]
BARRETT
Anyway, the, uh, Pentagon's been informed. They're sending a man
over to the hospital. Did I...?
[He points to his face. The smudge is mostly gone.]
CARTER
Close enough. Who are they sending?
BARRETT
(trying to remember the name)
A liaison officer.
CARTER
Major Davis.
BARRETT
(nodding)
Major Davis.
[Carter gets up and grabs her sidearm.]
BARRETT
What?
CARTER
There are twelve alien devices capable of mimicking specific
individuals. Major Davis was one of them.
INT--HOSPITAL
[Agent Devlin walks down a hall and enters an elevator. The doors
close. Alone in the elevator, Devlin reaches into his pocket and pulls
out a mimic device. He places it on his shirt and morphs into Major
Paul Davis. The elevator doors open and Devlin as Davis exits. He walks
to a room at the far end of the hall guarded by two SFs.]
DEVLIN AS DAVIS
Sergeant?
SERGEANT
Major Davis.
DEVLIN AS DAVIS
I've come to check on the Senator.
SERGEANT
Yes, sir.
INT--KINSEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM
[Devlin as Davis enters the room and closes the door. He pulls out his
sidearm and attaches a silencer. Kinsey is unconscious, an oxygen
cannula attached to him and his left hand over his chest.]
INT--THE COMMITTEE CONFERENCE ROOM
[Five men in business suits sit around a conference room in a black
room.]
COMMITTEE MEMBER ONE
Agent Devlin, how'd it go?
DEVLIN
Kinsey's dead.
COMMITTEE MEMBER TWO
Are you sure? He was supposed to be dead the first time.
DEVLIN
Well, he wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest this time, so yeah, I'm
sure. There were a few complications though.
FLASHBACK
INT--KINSEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM
[Devlin as Davis finishes attaching the silencer and cocks the weapon.
A fire alarm goes off. He hides his pistol and turns just before the
guards enter followed by some medical personnel.]
DEVLIN AS DAVIS
What's going on?
SERGEANT
Fire alarm. We need to move him.
[The medical staff wheel Kinsey out of the room. "Davis" moves to
follow, but the guards step in]
SERGEANT
We're going to have to ask you to wait here, sir.
"DAVIS"
And why is that, Sergeant?
["Davis" holds out his hands, then attacks both men, knocking them both
out with a few expert blows. He closes the door to the room, leaving
them lying on the floor.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM
COMMITTEE MEMBER THREE
Secondary casualties are not our concern. Major Davis can answer for
those as well.
COMMITTEE MEMBER ONE
We still have a loose end. They have Dr. Langham in custody.
COMMITTEE MEMBER THREE
That's not important. His accusations will be little more than a
minor inconvenience for us. Instead of worrying about him, I suggest
we use the mimic devices to eliminate another thorn in our side.
DEVLIN
Someone at the SGC?
COMMITTEE MEMBER THREE
General Hammond. Once he's out of the way, we can replace him with
someone more...sympathetic to our concerns.
[Devlin purses his lips.]
FLASHBACK
INT--HOSPITAL THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR
[Devlin as Davis walks quickly with determination down the hall. Kinsey
is being loaded into an elevator. The doors close as Devlin/Davis
reaches it. He watches to see that they are traveling as far as the
basement, then heads to the stairwell.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM
DEVLIN
If they know about the devices, they'll be prepared for something
like this.
COMMITTEE MEMBER TWO
Devlin's right. Besides, now that Kinsey's dead, we have other
options.
COMMITTEE MEMBER ONE
I think it's time we sent someone to talk to Hammond. Get him to
reconsider those retirement plans.
COMMITTEE MEMBER THREE
He doesn't seem like the type to bow to outside pressure.
COMMITTEE MEMBER TWO
Well then, we're going to have to be very convincing.
[Committee Member Two turns to Devlin.]
FLASHBACK
INT--HOSPITAL BASEMENT
[Devlin as Davis enters a locker room, his weapon drawn. He searches
the area. As he approaches a side corridor, he is hit with a zat held
by Major Carter. Barrett is next to her with his own weapon drawn.
Devlin/Davis collapses to the floor with a grunt. Carter and Barrett
approach. Carter searches, and finds the mimic device. She takes it
off, and he morphs back into his true form.]
END FLASHBACK
INT--CONFERENCE ROOM
COMMITTEE MEMBER TWO
Agent Devlin, I would like you to pay General Hammond a visit.
Impress upon him our...concerns for the safety and well-being of his
family.
"DEVLIN"
And if he still refuses to play ball?
COMMITTEE MEMBER THREE
(leaning forward)
Then kill him.
["Devlin" nods, then his image shorts out, morphing back and forth
between Carter and Devlin. The Committee members watch in shock.]
COMMITTEE MEMBER ONE
What is this?
[Devlin's image disappears completely, leaving Major Carter standing
there.]
CARTER
(smiling)
General Hammond sends his regards.
[The doors burst open, and several heavily armed men and Barrett storm
in.]
BARRETT
All right, get your hands up. Come on, get 'em up!
[Carter plucks off a mimic device from her shirt, hidden under her
white jacket. The Committee members all put their hands in the air.
Sufficiently covered by others, Barrett re-holsters his weapon. Carter
looks at her watch.]
CARTER
Wow, the hologram lasted six and a half minutes. That's a new record
for us.
BARRETT
You took a big risk.
CARTER
I knew you were listening.
BARRETT
What makes you think I was going to come in here before you got them
to incriminate themselves?
CARTER
(shrugging and smiling)
When you work with someone, you just know.
[Barrett smiles to himself.]
INT--KINSEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM
[Kinsey is standing by a mirror, adjusting his tie. The door is opened
by a guard. O'Neill, dressed in his Class A uniform, steps cautiously
inside.]
KINSEY
(smiling)
Ah, Colonel O'Neill. Glad you could make it.
O'NEILL
What do you want, Kinsey?
KINSEY
I just thought we should have a little chat before we meet the
press.
[Kinsey puts on his suit jacket.]
O'NEILL
(stiffly)
Did you need to gloat a little?
KINSEY
(chuckling)
Don't be that way, Jack. You need this as much as I do. The only way
you're going to get public vindication is if the two of us appear on
the six o'clock news shaking hands.
O'NEILL
(sighs)
Yeah...I'm not sure it's worth it.
[Kinsey adjusts his cuffs and steps closer.]
KINSEY
The American people don't want their Air Force officers to be
assassins, Jack, they want them to be heroes.
[He slaps O'Neill on the arm.]
KINSEY
I'm going to make you a hero.
[Kinsey steps out the door with a jaunty gait. O'Neill winces and
stands there a bit longer. Kinsey turns back at the doorway.]
KINSEY
Shall we?
[O'Neill hesitates, then follows.]
EXT--HOSPITAL, WASHINGTON, D.C., DAY
[A podium with microphones is set up at the door to the hospital.
Several reporters and photographers surround the podium. Television
camera monitors record the setup. Kinsey, his protection detail, and
O'Neill step forward. Kinsey reaches the podium.]
KINSEY
First of all, I want to apologize to you and to the American people
for the deception surrounding my...untimely demise. It was an
unfortunate but necessary final step in my investigation of certain
anti-democratic forces that had taken root in several key government
agencies. The ringleaders of this conspiracy have now been taken
into custody.
[As Kinsey speaks, O'Neill squirms slightly, clearly uncomfortable.]
KINSEY
(continuing, chuckling)
Of course, taking a bullet was not part of my original plan to bring
these men down. But the success of the operation was well worth any
personal sacrifice on my part. And I want the American people to
know that...if elected...I intend to bring that
same...determination...and zeal for justice with me to the White
House.
I would also like to thank Colonel Jack O'Neill of the United States
Air Force for the vital role he played in my investigation. I can't
go into details for reasons of national security, but I can assure
you all that any evidence pointing to the Colonel as my would-be
assassin was simply part of the operation.
[Smiling and confident, Kinsey turns to O'Neill and holds out his
hand.]
KINSEY
Colonel?
[O'Neill glances at Kinsey as the photographers take pictures. He
pauses and takes a deep breath, then shakes Kinsey's hand. The
reporters mutter comments and questions. Kinsey covers the main
microphone.]
KINSEY
(low, to O'Neill)
Smile, Colonel. You just won me the election.
[O'Neill looks very uncomfortable.]
