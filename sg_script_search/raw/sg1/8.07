TEASER
EXT--STREET
[A young girl cycles down a quiet residential street as a couple of
joggers pass by. A car comes down the street and collides into the rear
of another car just in front of it. A young boy sitting on a bench
looks up at the crash and the joggers turn to see what happened. Three
men exit the car which crashed into the back of the other and a young
man exits the front car. The radiator of the second car is hissing.]
BULLY
(yelling)
What the hell are you doing?
DRIVER
I was trying to park.
BULLY
Huh! Didn't you ever hear of signaling, pal?
DRIVER
I did signal.
BULLY
Listen man, if you don't know how to drive, maybe you should try
staying off the damn road!
[One of the men has walked around to stand behind the young driver.]
DRIVER
Maybe, if you hadn't have been tailgating me this wouldn't have
happened.
[The bully turns to his other friend, amazed that the young man has
replied to him.]
BULLY
Oh, no, you didn't just say that.
[The bully grabs the driver by the front of his jacket and pushes him
against the car.]
DRIVER
Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
[The young boy watching, looks around, concerned.]
BULLY
Too late.
[The bully swings his arm back to punch the young driver but his wrist
is grabbed by Teal'c.]
TEAL'C
This is unlawful behaviour.
BULLY
Who the hell are you?
TEAL'C
Collision procedure dictates that you exchange insurance information
and, if necessary, notify the police.
[One of the bully's friends laughs at the interruption.]
BULLY
(laughing, amazed)
What?
TEAL'C
This gentleman did indeed signal, which would indicate that it was
you who was at fault.
[The bully grabs at Teal'c's hand, trying to free himself.]
BULLY
Pal, you'd better learn to mind your own damn business.
[The bully takes a swing at Teal'c, who blocks the punch easily. Teal'c
head buts the man, who collapses to the ground. One of his friends
comes towards Teal'c, swinging. Teal'c ducks, then hits the man in the
face with his palm, then punches him. The man collapses to the ground.
The third bully throws a punch, but Teal'c lowers his head and the
bully hits the top of his skull, badly hurting his hand. Teal'c punches
the man, who also collapses to the ground. The first bully, spitting
blood, tries to get up but is once again punched to the ground.]
KID
(awed)
Wow!
TEAL'C
(to driver)
I believe it will now be necessary to notify the police.
DRIVER
Yeah. Thanks.
[Teal'c bows slightly and smiles at the driver.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[Davis knocks carefully at the door, obviously not wanting to disturb
O'Neill who is doing paperwork.]
DAVIS
Sir...uhh...Colonel Kendrick from the Office of Special
Investigations is here to see you.
O'NEILL
(loudly and pointedly)
Does he have an appointment?
DAVIS
No, sir...
[The door swings open and Kendrick pushes past Davis to stand in front
of O'Neill.]
KENDRICK
You wouldn't return my phone calls. Sir.
O'NEILL
I was busy...didn't think it was important? Take your pick.
KENDRICK
You know as well as I do there's been another incident.
[O'Neill looks over at Davis who is still in the doorway. Davis raises
his hand and leaves.]
KENDRICK
When you petitioned the OSI to allow Teal'c to live off base, your
request was approved under certain provisions. These provisions have
clearly been violated.
O'NEILL
Oh, come on, Colonel. If you had saved Earth from total annihilation
a couple of times and your government told you you couldn't go out
to play...wouldn't you consider it more a...guideline than a rule?
KENDRICK
We all appreciate what Teal'c has done for us, sir, on numerous
occasions. But that doesn't change the fact that he's a liability
and every day he's allowed to roam around in public jeopardises
national security.
O'NEILL
Oh, don't be so dramatic, Dick, it'll give you gas.
KENDRICK
(threateningly)
Either you take action to ensure these provisions are met...or the
OSI will.
O'NEILL
Hey! Watch it. I'll look into it.
KENDRICK
Yes, sir.
[Kendrick leaves, with O'Neill waving his hand after him.]
EXT--APARTMENT BLOCK
INT--TEAL'C'S APARTMENT
[Teal'c opens the apartment door in response to a knock.]
DANIEL
Hey!
TEAL'C
Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
Just wanted to come by and see how you're settling in.
TEAL'C
Please enter.
[Daniel walks in and looks around as Teal'c closes the door.]
DANIEL
Wow! I like what you're doing with the place. Sort of...Jaffa chic
with a east African flair.
TEAL'C
I have discovered there are many programmes on television which
offer advice in the area of home design and decoration.
DANIEL
Yeah, I'm a little more into the history channel myself.
TEAL'C
Can I offer you anything?
DANIEL
No, I'm fine. How's the fern doing?
[Teal'c raises an eyebrow and gestures to a plant on a shelf. The fern
does not look healthy. Daniel walks up to it and touches its leaves.]
DANIEL
I don't suppose you've tried talking to it.
TEAL'C
I have not. Perhaps you should tell me why you are here.
DANIEL
A guy just can't come by and visit his friend?
[Daniel sits as Teal'c raises an eyebrow questioningly.]
DANIEL
Yep, heard what happened the other day. Three KO's, first round.
[Daniel gets up from the chair.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill sent you to speak with me.
DANIEL
No...yeah.
TEAL'C
I broke no law. I intervened to prevent a criminal activity and was
forced to defend myself.
DANIEL
You see, that's kind of the point. Look, there's no reason why you
shouldn't be allowed to live off base. I mean, especially when
you're not carrying a symbiote anymore, but... you're supposed to be
keeping a low profile.
TEAL'C
That is not always easy.
DANIEL
I'm not just talking about the tattoo, although I do see how that
could be a problem.
TEAL'C
I often cover it, to avoid stares in public. I tell those who have
seen it, that it is a tribal mark from my homeland.
DANIEL
Yes, this is less about appearance, than it is about behaviour.
TEAL'C
Have I not conducted myself as a typical member of this community?
DANIEL
No, no, actually, no, you haven't. Ummm...besides the other day,
there was the incident with the old man and the teenagers in the
park. There was that thing with the guy with the pitbull.
TEAL'C
In each case, I was only attempting to render assistance where it
was needed.
DANIEL
You see, that's kinda the problem. Normal human beings are a little
more careful about getting involved in business that isn't theirs. I
know. That sounds bad, but it's just the way it is, and you can't
afford to be drawing attention to yourself.
[Teal'c ponders what Daniel has said.]
TEAL'C
I understand.
[There is a knock at the door and Teal'c turns to answer it.]
TEAL'C
Excuse me.
[He opens the door to a young woman.]
WOMAN
Hi.
TEAL'C
Krista.
[Krista holds up a bag of cookies.]
KRISTA
Made you cookies.
[Teal'c smiles and accepts the bag.]
TEAL'C
Please come in.
[Krista enters and sees Daniel in the apartment.]
KRISTA
I'm sorry, I didn't realise you had company.
TEAL'C
Krista James, this is Daniel Jackson.
[Teal'c and Krista walk up to Daniel. Krista and Daniel shake hands.]
DANIEL
(smiling)
Hi.
TEAL'C
Krista lives in the apartment next door.
KRISTA
Wait a minute, Doctor Jackson? You're the archaeologist who hired
Teal'c to come over from Mozambique.
DANIEL
That's right!
KRISTA
Well, then I should thank you. It's been great having him here. It's
nice to have a man around who cares about his neighbours.
DANIEL
Actually, we were just talking about that.
KRISTA
In fact, that's why I'm here.
(to Teal'c)
The cookies were a bribe. My pipes are doing that thing again.
TEAL'C
Normally, I would be happy to provide assistance, however...
DANIEL
No, no, no, no, no. Don't let me interrupt. I've gotta be going
anyway. It's very nice to meet you.
KRISTA
Nice to meet you.
DANIEL
Ah, Teal'c, that other thing we were talking about, ummm...every
rule has its exceptions.
[Daniel waves as he leaves and Krista raises her hand in farewell.]
EXT--PARK
[Pete and Carter are buying food from a cart.]
PETE
(to vendor)
Thanks.
[They walk away from the vendor.]
PETE
So, how are things in the galaxy?
CARTER
You know I can't talk about work.
PETE
Sorry. I'm still getting used to the fact that my girlfriend's a
superhero.
CARTER
A bit of an exaggeration.
PETE
The superhero part? Or the girlfriend part?
[Carter smiles at Pete.]
PETE
You travel to other planets to do battle with alien creatures bent
on galactic domination. Just because you don't wear a tight spandex
outfit doesn't mean that you're not...although...it's an idea you
might wanna consider.
[They are now sitting on a bench. They both laugh.]
CARTER
Look, I know this is hard for you. Any other guy would have just
freaked out and run away.
PETE
You didn't run away when I stalked you. Anyway, I just want you to
appreciate the position I'm in here.
CARTER
I do, believe me, and I'm really glad you stuck around.
PETE
I'm glad to hear you say that, 'cos I put in for a transfer to
Colorado Springs PD.
[Carter smiles and kisses Pete.]
CARTER
Are you sure?
PETE
I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. That's why
I got you this.
[Pete shows Carter a ring box, containing a diamond ring. Carter is
completely surprised.]
CARTER
Oh, my God!
[Carter looks at Pete, saying nothing.]
EXT--STREET
[A couple of joggers run past Teal'c and Krista, who are walking along
the street, carrying paper sacks of groceries.]
KRISTA
I'm sorry to keep asking you to help with my plumbing but the
super's never around and my boyfriend's not very handy.
TEAL'C
There is no need to apologise.
[They walk past a woman getting out of her car. The woman places her
handbag on the car roof.]
KRISTA
Anyhow, you'll forgive me once you've tasted my lasagne.
TEAL'C
I'm looking forward to it.
[The young boy who witnessed Teal'c beating the three bullies walks up
to them.]
KID
Yo, T!
TEAL'C
Greetings, Eric.
[The two shake hands extravagantly.]
ERIC
I saw you take out those three gorillas the other day. Nice work.
TEAL'C
In retrospect it may have been unwise to intervene.
ERIC
Are you kidding? They deserved it.
[The woman at the car is standing, putting on makeup. A young man runs
up to the car and grabs her handbag from the roof.]
WOMAN
Hey! Hey stop that guy, he's got my purse, hey!
[The thief runs past Krista, knocking her shopping to the ground.]
ERIC
Aren't you gonna do anything?
TEAL'C
I must not intervene.
[Krista looks back at Teal'c. puzzled.]
ERIC
What? You just gonna let him get away?
[Teal'c looks at the thief, running further into the distance, and at
Krista, who turns away to look at the thief. Teal'c places his bag on
the ground, picks up a piece of fruit and throws it, hitting the thief,
who collapses to the ground.]
ERIC
Oh man! What a shot.
KRISTA
How did you do that?
ERIC
You the man, T.
[The woman turns to Teal'c, amazed.]
WOMAN
Thank you. That was amazing.
[Teal'c smiles and bows at the woman.]
KRISTA
That was amazing.
ERIC
T money, you are the man. Gotta give the man his props.
[As Teal'c shakes hands with Eric, it becomes obvious that someone is
taking photos of Teal'c. Teal'c looks around, uncomfortable.]
INT--TEAL'C'S APARTMENT NIGHT
[The apartment is lit by many candles. Teal'c hears a man banging at
Krista's door.]
MAN
Krista! Krista! Come on, Krista. Listen, listen, listen, just let me
in. Just let me in.
INT--BUILDING HALLWAY
[Teal'c goes out into the hallway and walks towards Krista's
apartment.]
KRISTA
Doug, I have to work tomorrow.
DOUG
So?
KRISTA
So? You're drunk. Just go home. Please.
DOUG
No, no, no, I ain't going nowhere.
KRISTA
Doug...
TEAL'C
Is there a problem?
DOUG
This is a private conversation.
TEAL'C
If it were private, you would not be conducting it in the hallway,
nor speaking so loudly.
[A door behind Teal'c opens, and an elderly woman holding a cat peers
out. Teal'c turns towards the neighbour.]
KRISTA
(to neighbour)
It's alright, Mrs Connors. Just go back inside.
[The woman glares, and shuts the door. Teal'c turns back to Krista and
Doug, the smile he gave to the neighbour slipping from his face.]
TEAL'C
(to Krista)
Do you require assistance?
KRISTA
No, I'm okay.
[Doug turns away from Krista to face Teal'c.]
DOUG
Who the hell is this guy?
KRISTA
His name is Teal'c. He's my neighbour.
DOUG
Teal'c? What kind of a crazy name is that?
KRISTA
He just moved here form Mozambique.
DOUG
Ooh...no doubt.
TEAL'C
Krista has requested that you leave. I suggest you comply.
DOUG
You better check yourself, before you get hurt.
TEAL'C
I have checked. I suggest you leave, before it's you that gets hurt.
KRISTA
Doug, go sober up.
DOUG
You know what? I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
[Doug leaves.]
KRISTA
I'm sorry about that. I hate when he gets that way.
TEAL'C
This is not the first time. So you have stopped receiving him.
KRISTA
Not exactly. He's not always like that. Since he lost his job, he's
just been, you know...
TEAL'C
I do not.
KRISTA
It's been hard on him.
TEAL'C
And has it not been hard on you?
KRISTA
I'm fine.
[Teal'c smiles slightly, and nods at Krista.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY
INT--SGC DANIEL'S LAB
TEAL'C
I do not understand Krista's behaviour.
[Teal'c is standing at Daniel's desk. Carter and Daniel are seated
behind it, at a monitor.]
DANIEL
Yeah, it's a common problem. Most cultures on Earth recognise that
there's a significant gap between the experiences of men and women.
Among the Masai of East Africa, each newly wed man is required to
wear his wife's clothing for a month, as a way of gaining insight
into her life.
CARTER
If only it were that simple.
DANIEL
The point is, while rituals and customs may vary, almost all
cultures put significant pressure on single adults to form bonding
pairs. In ancient Persia, if a girl died a virgin, they would go so
far as to marry her corpse off before burial.
[Carter turns to Daniel, shocked.]
CARTER
That's horrible
DANIEL
The groom was usually quite well paid.
CARTER
It's bad enough being on your own without every TV show and
commercial and magazine ad trying to tell you how abnormal it is.
DANIEL
I think that's what I just said.
CARTER
They make you afraid of being alone but at the same time tell you
not to settle for anything less than the perfect romantic ideal,
like that actually exists anywhere in the real world. Either way you
can't win!
[Carter sighs. Daniel looks at Teal'c, eyebrows raised.]
DANIEL
(to Carter)
How's things?
CARTER
Good. We were talking about Teal'c's friend, right?
DANIEL
I thought we were.
CARTER
Teal'c, how do Jaffa couples handle their problems?
TEAL'C
On Chulak, a dispute between a man and a woman that cannot be
resolved necessitates a pledge break. It must be requested by one
and granted by the other.
DANIEL
And if that doesn't work?
TEAL'C
A weapon is required.
[Carter and Daniel say nothing.]
EXT--PARK DAY
[Teal'c is practising his Tai'Chi-like exercises. Krista is behind him,
watching.]
KRISTA
Sorry, I don't want to interrupt you, I just came out for a little
air.
TEAL'C
Are you alright?
KRISTA
I had another fight with Doug. I told him it's over. I don't want to
see him anymore.
TEAL'C
Are you not happy with your decision?
KRISTA
I guess it was the right thing to do. But he's not a bad person.
He's just going through a tough time.
TEAL'C
You have no cause to feel guilty.
KRISTA
What was that you were just doing?
TEAL'C
It is called Lok'nel, an ancient form of martial arts training.
KRISTA
You think you could teach me?
[Teal'c smiles slightly and bows his head in agreement. They begin.
Many days pass with Teal'c training Krista in the art. They practise
both in the park and in the apartment. An attraction appears to be
forming between the two.]
INT--BUILDING HALLWAY
[Teal'c leaves his apartment and goes to Krista's door.]
INT--KRISTA'S APARTMENT
[Teal'c knocks on Krista's door.]
KRISTA
Oh, hi.
TEAL'C
You are late for your next training session.
KRISTA
Yeah, I meant to tell you. I don't think I'm going to be able to
train with you anymore.
TEAL'C
You have been making tremendous progress.
KRISTA
Well, I just don't have time, you know?
TEAL'C
Has something transpired?
KRISTA
No, everything's fine. Look, I've gotta go.
[As Krista brings up her right hand to close the door, Teal'c notices
bruising around her wrist and stops her from closing the door.]
TEAL'C
You are injured.
KRISTA
It's nothing. Please
DOUG
(from inside the apartment)
Krista, who is it?
KRISTA
It's just my neighbour.
[Doug comes to the door.]
DOUG
Oh yeah? The plumber. I'll handle this.
KRISTA
Doug, it's not...
DOUG
I said, I'll handle it!
[Krista goes back into the apartment as the neighbour's door opens and
the woman peers out.]
DOUG
Don't think I don't know what's been going on around here. She told
me everything.
TEAL'C
Are you the one who injured her?
DOUG
What goes on between me and Krista, it ain't none of your business.
TEAL'C
If you ever injure her again, I will kill you where you stand.
[Teal'c leaves.]
INT--SGC CARTER'S LAB
[Carter is working at a computer on her desk. O'Neill enters.]
O'NEILL
Carter.
CARTER
Sir.
O'NEILL
I never thought I'd hear myself utter these words. I need that
report.
CARTER
Right. Um, I just need to finish typing up my notes.
[Carter starts searching her desk.]
CARTER
Uh...yeah, I'll have it for you first thing tomorrow.
[O'Neill looks at his watch.]
O'NEILL
It is tomorrow.
CARTER
Oh.
O'NEILL
I'm joking, I don't need the report.
CARTER
Well then, why....
O'NEILL
Because something's going on with you. You haven't tried to confuse
me with any scientific babble for the last couple of days and that's
a red flag to me.
[Carter sighs and hands the ring box to O'Neill.]
CARTER
Pete gave me this.
[O'Neill takes the box and opens it.]
O'NEILL
People normally wear these on their fingers.
CARTER
I haven't said yes.
O'NEILL
And yet, you haven't said no.
CARTER
I told him I needed to think about it.
O'NEILL
And?
[O'Neill puts down the ring box.]
CARTER
That was two weeks ago.
O'NEILL
Ah!
CARTER
You know, all these years I've been concentrating on work I just
assumed that one day I would...
O'NEILL
Have a life?
CARTER
Yeah. And now it comes down to it, I don't know. I mean, every time
we go through the gate we risk not coming back. Is it fair to put
somebody else through that?
O'NEILL
Pete is a cop. I think he could handle it.
CARTER
What about kids?
O'NEILL
What about 'em?
CARTER
Do I take maternity leave and then come back? Do I drop the baby off
at daycare on my way to some unexplored planet on the edge of the
crab nebula?
O'NEILL
Carter, there are people on this base who have families.
CARTER
What about you? If things had been different...
O'NEILL
I wouldn't be here.
INT--BUILDING HALLWAY
[Teal'c enters the hallway and sees Krista sitting on the floor outside
his door.]
TEAL'C
Krista.
[Krista gets up, wiping tears from her face.]
KRISTA
Hey, I was waiting for you.
TEAL'C
Has something happened?
KRISTA
No, I'm fine. It's just, it's over with Doug. For real this time.
I'm sorry about what happened before.
[Teal'c smiles and gently wipes the tears from her cheek with his
thumb.]
KRISTA
I need to get out of here. I can't even think in this place. Will
you come with me?
TEAL'C
Perhaps tomorrow.
KRISTA
No, now. Tonight. We'll just get in the car and drive. We'll take
the whole weekend. It doesn't even matter where we end up, as long
as it's away from here. Please.
INT--SGC DANIEL'S LAB
[Daniel is working at a monitor as Carter enters, looking worried.]
DANIEL
Hey, what's going on?
CARTER
General O'Neill just got off the phone with Colonel Kendrick.
Krista's boyfriend was found dead in her apartment.
DANIEL
What? What happened?
CARTER
We don't have all the details yet, but according to Kendrick,
preliminary evidence indicates that Teal'c may have been
responsible.
DANIEL
That's impossible.
CARTER
That's what I said. Unfortunately, we can't ask him about it because
he's missing. So Krista. As of right now, Teal'c is wanted for
kidnapping and murder.
INT--VEHICLE NIGHT
[Teal'c is driving with Krista in the passenger seat.]
KRISTA
Thanks for getting me out of there. I just couldn't be in that place
tonight.
TEAL'C
Where do you wish to go?
KRISTA
Just keep driving.
[Teal'c adjusts the rear-view mirror.]
KRISTA
What? What is it?
TEAL'C
I do not wish to alarm you but I believe that we are being followed.
KRISTA
Who would be following us?
TEAL'C
Perhaps Doug.
KRISTA
No.
[Teal'c looks over at Krista.]
KRISTA
He doesn't know I'm gone yet.
TEAL'C
Then they are most likely following me.
KRISTA
You? Why would anyone be following you?
TEAL'C
It is difficult to explain.
[Krista looks back to see a car follow them around a corner.]
KRISTA
Can you lose them?
TEAL'C
I believe so. However, it will require me to violate posted speed
limits and several safe driving regulations.
KRISTA
I'm okay with that.
[Teal'c looks at Krista and nods.]
TEAL'C
Hold on.
[Teal'c presses down on the accelerator and the vehicle can be heard
speeding up.]
INT--MOTEL ROOM NIGHT
[Teal'c and Krista enter a motel room. As Teal'c shuts the door, Krista
closes the curtains.]
KRISTA
Don't tell me you learned how to do that back in your village.
TEAL'C
There are aspects of my life which I am not at liberty to divulge.
KRISTA
What are you? A spy or something? One thing's for sure, you're not
really Doctor Jackson's research assistant. That much I figure after
about 30 seconds.
[Teal'c sighs.]
TEAL'C
Krista...
[Krista places her finger on his lips to stop him saying any more.]
KRISTA
It's okay. For now, I'm just glad you're here.
[They kiss.]
EXT--CARTER'S CAR DAY
[Pete gets into Carter's car.]
PETE
Hi.
CARTER
Thanks for meeting me.
PETE
No problem.
CARTER
Pete, I'm sorry.
[Pete's smile fades.]
CARTER
I need a little more time. Look, you know how I feel about you, it's
just...there's some things I need to work out.
PETE
Okay.
CARTER
Anyway, that's not what this is about.
PETE
It's not?
CARTER
No. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't so important.
PETE
What's going on?
CARTER
I need your help.
INT--MOTEL ROOM
[Teal'c wakes to find the bed next to him empty.]
TEAL'C
Krista?
[There is no reply.]
TEAL'C
Krista!
[As Teal'c checks the bathroom, there is a knock at the door. Teal'c
opens it, to be faced with a number of armed policemen.]
OFFICER
Police! Turn around and lace your fingers behind your head.
[Teal'c does so, frowning.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[O'Neill is walking down the corridor, followed by Kendrick.]
KENDRICK
Well, where is he being held?
O'NEILL
He's in his old quarters.
[Kendrick sighs.]
KENDRICK
Is he at least under guard?
O'NEILL
He's not going anywhere.
KENDRICK
He's a murder suspect.
INT--SGC O'NEILL'S OFFICE
[They enter the office.]
O'NEILL
You know, I talked to him. He said he didn't do it.
KENDRICK
That's good enough for you is it?
O'NEILL
Pretty much.
KENDRICK
Well, unfortunately, you're not in charge of this investigation.
O'NEILL
Yeah. He also said he felt like he was being followed last night.
KENDRICK
The OSI did not have Teal'c under surveillance.
O'NEILL
Yeah. How did you find him?
KENDRICK
We received a tip.
O'NEILL
That didn't strike you as...odd?
KENDRICK
I told you something like this might happen, you flat out ignored my
warnings.
O'NEILL
Not so much ignored as completely disregarded.
KENDRICK
With all due respect, General. I'm going to have to insist that
Teal'c be placed in confinement immediately, or I will recommend
that he be held elsewhere.
INT--SGC DANIEL'S LAB
[Daniel is sorting through paperwork on his desk. Suddenly, on the
monitor in front of him, a number of symbols appear followed by the
message, "Look familiar?"]
DANIEL
What the hell?
[The phone rings and Daniel answers it.]
DANIEL
Daniel Jackson.
[The male voice on the other end of the line is distorted.]
CALLER
Did you get my message?
DANIEL
Who is this?
CALLER
The symbols, Doctor Jackson. Do you recognise them?
DANIEL
I don't know who you think this is.
CALLER
We need it translated into Goa'uld.
DANIEL
I have no idea what you're talking about.
CALLER
We know it's the language of the Ancients, but the dialect is
obscure. You're the one man on Earth who can translate them. Your
friend Teal'c is in trouble.
DANIEL
How do you know about that?
CALLER
We can help him. We've been watching him. In fact, we saw the whole
thing.
DANIEL
You witnessed the murder?
CALLER
We've got it all on tape. Concrete evidence that proves Teal'c's
innocence, and it's yours in exchange for the translation. Of
course, if you tell anyone we'll know, and the deals off.
[The caller rings off.]
EXT--STREET DAY
INT--KRISTA'S APARTMENT
[Pete and Carter are looking at the marked outline of a body.]
PETE
The investigator who checked the position of the body, concluded
that the victim was pinned and choked against this wall, and then
fell to the floor.
[Pete crouches by the outline.]
CARTER
So...?
PETE
So, I'm not so sure. The proximity of the body to the wall supports
that, but the position of the body suggests otherwise.
CARTER
What do you mean?
PETE
If he fell into a slump, his legs and arms would be bent.
[Pete shows Carter a photograph of the body.]
PETE
His legs are straight and his arms are placed by his sides,
suggesting that the body was dragged here and placed in this
position.
CARTER
Why move the body?
PETE
Well, dying against the wall suggested the victim was attacked by
somebody bigger and stronger.
CARTER
Like Teal'c. So it was a set up.
PETE
It's possible. Now, you said that Teal'c thought he was being
followed.
CARTER
That's right.
PETE
The Air Force denies having him under surveillance?
CARTER
Yeah.
[Pete walks over to the window and pulls back the curtains to look
across to the apartments over the road.]
PETE
If I were staking out Teal'c's place, that's where I would be.
INT--ANOTHER APARTMENT
[Pete unlocks the door and enters, followed by Carter.]
PETE
Hello?
[Carter shuts the door. The apartment is empty of furniture. Pete and
Carter walk over to one of the windows.]
PETE
From this vantage point you can easily see into both apartments.
[Pete crouches down, pointing out three marks in the carpet.]
PETE
Three indentations.
CARTER
Tripod.
PETE
Unfortunately, I think they cleaned the place up pretty good. I
doubt we'll find anything.
CARTER
So it's a dead end.
PETE
Not necessarily. Is there a pizza place nearby?
CARTER
Why?
PETE
One thing about a stakeout? You never eat healthy.
EXT--PARK
[Daniel is waiting in the park. He is approached by a man holding a
styrofoam coffee cup.]
MAN
Doctor Jackson. Keep walking. You came alone. I'm impressed. I like
a man who can follow instructions.
[They walk towards a bench.]
DANIEL
You're the one who called me?
MAN
It doesn't matter. Have you completed the translation?
DANIEL
Yeah, see, that's why I wanted to talk to you. I need more time.
MAN
You're playing with your friend's life here, Doctor.
DANIEL
I can't translate something unless I understand the context. Where
they were found, what they're for.
MAN
You think I'm stupid?
DANIEL
I'm not lying.
MAN
I can see we're going to have to do this the hard way.
DANIEL
What does that mean?
MAN
Either you give us the translation now, or I'll be forced to take
this to the next level.
DANIEL
So, beyond kidnapping and murder?
MAN
We didn't kill the boyfriend. But we'll kill the girl if we have to.
DANIEL
How do I know you even have her?
MAN
Come with me and I'll show you.
DANIEL
Yeah, you know, I got a thing, so...
[Daniel turns to walk away.]
MAN
I have three snipers targeting your position at this very moment,
Doctor.
[Daniel turns back.]
DANIEL
You're bluffing.
[The man places the coffee cup on the bench.]
MAN
Position one, take the coffee cup
[A bullet pierces the centre of the cup.]
DANIEL
So, we gonna take your car or mine, or should I just follow you?
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN DAY
INT--SGC TEAL'C'S QUARTERS
CARTER
We checked a couple of pizza joints and all night delivery places
near your apartment to see if there'd been any sudden repeat
customers.
TEAL'C
Interesting investigative method.
CARTER
Yeah, I thought it was a little crazy at first too, but we actually
got a lead at one place. The owner reported a Caucasian male who'd
been in half a dozen times during the last two weeks.
TEAL'C
Is that unusual?
CARTER
Not necessarily, but we thought it was worth checking out. We got a
license plate from the security camera out front and we're running
it down.
[Teal'c bows his head at Carter. A guard opens the door and O'Neill
enters.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill.
[Teal'c and Carter stand.]
O'NEILL
Well, Kendrick is finally convinced something else is going on here.
CARTER
What changed his mind?
O'NEILL
Daniel's missing.
[Carter and Teal'c look at each other, concerned.]
INT--VEHICLE
[Daniel is sitting in the rear of the van, with his hands handcuffed in
front of him. Two men, including the one who met him in the park, are
sitting next to him.]
DANIEL
So you guys are ex NID? Calling yourselves a trust now, right?
MAN
We want the same thing you want, Doctor Jackson. We're trying to
protect the planet.
DANIEL
That's why you were watching Teal'c. You thought he was a
significant threat to planetary security.
MAN
Stargate Command may think it's okay to let an alien roam the
streets unsupervised. We beg to differ.
DANIEL
And never mind the fact that he's helped save the Earth more times
than I can count.
MAN
He is an alien. Their motives can never be trusted. Anyway, he is
partly responsible for the boyfriend's death. If he hadn't shown the
girl how to crush a man's windpipe, none of this would have
happened.
DANIEL
So she killed him?
MAN
It was self defence really. He was getting out of hand.
DANIEL
And that's when you guys moved in, you planted evidence to make it
look like Teal'c did it.
MAN
We saw an opportunity and we took it.
[The van drives into a warehouse.]
INT--WAREHOUSE
[The van stops and Daniel is helped down onto the ground. He is taken
further into the biulding, passing another man.]
MAN #2
What the hell's going on here?
[Daniel is pushed down onto a chair.]
MAN #1
The situation is under control.
MAN #2
You were supposed to get the information and leave.
MAN #1
He wasn't going to co-operate.
[Daniel turns to look at the two men talking behind him.]
MAN #2
He's a member of SG-1. Do you have any idea what kind of resources
they'll mobilise to get him back?
MAN #1
Once we get the translation, it'll be too late. Bring the girl!
[One of the men guarding Daniel nods and leaves. A woman is standing at
a table containing equipment and monitors. The two men walk up to face
Daniel.]
INT--SGC LAB
[Carter is working at a monitor when the phone rings. She answers it.]
CARTER
Carter.
PETE
Sam, it's me. I traced the car from the pizza place. It's a rental.
The name on the agreement is a fake ID.
CARTER
That's our man.
PETE
Whoever set this up knew what they were doing. I've got a bank
account, social security number and credit cards all from a guy who
died six months ago.
CARTER
Okay, let's focus on the car. Find out if the rental company has
satellite tracking.
PETE
I'm on it. I'll call you as soon as I have something.
INT--WAREHOUSE
[The woman is working at the monitors.]
WOMAN
Uplink is established. We're ready to transmit.
[The men turn to Daniel.]
MAN #2
We need those symbols.
[One of the men brings Krista into the room.]
KRISTA
Daniel?
[Krista is pulled over to a chair by Daniel.]
KRISTA
What's happening? Who are these people?
DANIEL
It's gonna be okay.
MAN #2
The symbols.
[He holds out paper and a pen to Daniel.]
MAN #1
Now. Or we kill the girl.
DANIEL
She's got nothing to do with this.
MAN #2
Look, Doctor Jackson, if it had been up to me things never would
have gone this far. It was supposed to be a simple surveillance
operation. But then this little domestic dispute happened, and
Teal'c got involved. We knew you weren't going to help us
voluntarily.
DANIEL
So you decided to try a little blackmail instead.
MAN #2
Let's just say one thing led to another. But in any case, it's too
late for all that now.
[He pulls a gun out of a side holster.]
MAN #2
So either you give us what we want...
[He cocks the weapon and points it at Krista.]
MAN #2
...or I will kill her.
[Daniel looks at Krista who is shaking in fear, He holds out his hands
for the paper.]
MAN #2
Oh, and by the way? We'll know immediately if the symbols are
incorrect.
[Daniel looks at the man and smiles grimly. He works on the
translation. Once finished, the translation is taken from him and
placed into a scanner. the woman types at the computer.]
WOMAN
Scanning. Transmitting symbols. Translation confirmed.
[Krista heaves a sigh of relief.]
MAN #2
Good. Get up!
EXT--WAREHOUSE
[A number of trucks and armed men arrive at the warehouse. They take
position at the door.]
INT--WAREHOUSE
MAN #2
Over there, face the wall.
[Krista and Daniel don't move, looking at each other worriedly. They
are both grabbed and taken to stand by the wall.]
DANIEL
I gave you what you wanted.
MAN #2
Move!
[Daniel turns to face the man. The man raises his weapon.]
MAN #2
I said face the wall.
[Daniel turns to the wall.]
DANIEL
Look, you don't have to do this.
[The computer systems are being wiped.]
EXT--WAREHOUSE
[Carter and Pete join the armed men. Expolsives are set on the door.]
INT--WAREHOUSE
KRISTA
(scared)
Daniel?
DANIEL
It's gonna be okay.
[The man zats them both and they collapse to the floor. The woman
passes a hand-scanner over the computer, wiping all data. The men and
woman congregate in a circle.]
EXT--WAREHOUSE
[The armed men are in position next to the doorway.]
OFFICER
(into radio)
Team two in position and ready.
INT--WAREHOUSE
[A flashing light and sounds suggest that The Trust people have been
ringed to another location.]
EXT--WAREHOUSE
CARTER
(into radio)
Go!
[Two explosions at the door allow it to be pushed open. The armed
personnel enter, followed by Carter and Pete. The warehouse is empty of
peole, apart from Daniel and Krista. One of the men checks Daniel's
pulse as Pete crouches next to Krista.]
OFFICER
He's unconscious. There's no-one here. We've got all the exits
covered, there's no way they could have gotten out.
PETE
How is that possible?
[The equipment is being dismantled. Krista and Daniel are sitting on
chairs, conscious. Daniel is rubbing his eyes as Krista is handed a cup
of water.]
KRISTA
(to Daniel)
Thank you.
[Carter and Pete are standing next to one of the vehicles.]
PETE
So, it's normal for the bad guys to just disappear into thin air,
right?
CARTER
Not really. Although now I think about it, it's not the first time
it's happened.
PETE
Just another day at the office.
CARTER
Yes.
PETE
Figures you should be used to it by now.
CARTER
No, I mean, yes.
[Pete looks at Carter searchingly.]
PETE
Yes, as in?
CARTER
Yes.
[Pete grabs Carter to bring her nearer to him.]
PETE
Are you messing with me?
CARTER
No.
PETE
Which means?
CARTER
Yes.
PETE
You don't need more time?
CARTER
No.
PETE
Therefore...
[Carter smiles.]
CARTER
Yes.
[They hug and kiss.]
EXT--STREET
[Teal'c is packing his vehicle with boxes. Eric is rolling his
skateboard along the footway. There is a box on the skateboard.]
TEAL'C
Be careful with that package, Eric. Its contents are...
[The skateboard falls off the kerb and a sound of breaking glass is
heard from within the box.]
TEAL'C
...fragile.
ERIC
Sorry.
TEAL'C
There is no need for an apology.
[Teal'c picks up the box.]
TEAL'C
I am grateful for your assistance.
[As Teal'c turns to put the box in the vehicle, Krista is standing
nearby.]
KRISTA
Hey!
[Teal'c bows his head at her.]
KRISTA
So, you're really leaving.
TEAL'C
Indeed I am.
KRISTA
You know, you don't have to do this. The whole thing was my fault.
TEAL'C
There is no need to blame yourself.
KRISTA
The men in the warehouse? I didn't know who they were. No-one told
me anything. But I know they were using me to get to you.
TEAL'C
If it had not been you, it would have been someone else. They would
not hesitate to exploit any relationship to their advantage.
KRISTA
What did they want?
TEAL'C
That I cannot say.
KRISTA
Right. So, where are you gonna go?
TEAL'C
Back to where I came from.
KRISTA
What does that mean?
TEAL'C
It means I must say goodbye.
[Krista notices Eric over Teal'c's shoulder. Teal'c turns to him. Eric
is carrying the fern.]
ERIC
This is all that was left.
TEAL'C
Thank you.
[Teal'c takes the fern from Eric.]
ERIC
Check it out.
[Eric shows Teal'c the bottom of his skateboard, where Teal'c's
forehead symbol has been drawn.]
TEAL'C
I am honoured.
ERIC
Later, dude.
[Teal'c closes the boot, looks at Krista then gets into the car. Eric
and Krista watch him drive off.]
