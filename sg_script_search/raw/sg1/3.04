TEASER
INT--ALIEN WORLD, CORRIDOR
[SG-1 are walking along a darkened corridor, lit only by their
flashlights.]
O'NEILL
Daniel, any ideas about this place?
DANIEL
Well it looks like it was built by a pretty advanced culture and
then...stripped and deserted.
CARTER
The MALP showed no life signs.
[A single, red stone is set in the wall to one side of a sealed door.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c? What do you think?
TEAL'C
It is an ancient Goa'uld design.
[Teal'c touches the stone, and the door slides open.]
O'NEILL
Now that is not a good smell.
[As SG-1 enters the chamber, Daniel trips over a dead body.]
DANIEL
Ah, Jeez!
O'NEILL
All right, Level A.
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel put on protective gear, as Teal'c discovers
another body.]
TEAL'C
There is another one here.
O'NEILL
More over there.
[As Carter examines one of the corpses, she notices a scar along the
back of its neck.]
CARTER
These aren't quite human. They're Goa'uld.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
INT--ALIEN WORLD, CHAMBER
[Teal'c is examining the red stone on the inside door of the chamber.]
TEAL'C
This mechanism appears to have been damaged by a ribbon device.
CARTER
Maybe they were trying to contain whatever did this.
[Daniel notices a symbol engraved on a nearby table.]
DANIEL
Teal'c, do you recognize this symbol?
TEAL'C
It is the crest of the Linvris.
O'NEILL
Which is what or...who?
TEAL'C
A rival league of lesser Goa'uld who challenged the System Lords.
O'NEILL
A minor league.
TEAL'C
Yes. There are nine.
[Carter shines her flashlight around the room, counting each of the
dead bodies.]
CARTER
...Five, six, seven, eight, nine. Found 'em.
[Daniel reaches under the table and picks something up.]
DANIEL
It's one of those Goa'uld tablet devices, the kind we found on
Argos.
CARTER
Can you translate it?
DANIEL
Part of it. It's some sort of battle plan. I need the hand device
that makes the screen go to the next page.
[O'Neill notices a half-hidden object under the table.]
O'NEILL
That thing?
[Daniel picks up the hand device and runs it over the tablet, but it
doesn't work.]
DANIEL
Nothing's happening.
[He suddenly jumps and turns around.]
O'NEILL
What?
DANIEL
I felt something brush by me.
[O'Neill shines his light around the chamber, but doesn't see anything
amiss.]
O'NEILL
Yeah, all right, let's pack it out of here, leave this to the
medical containment unit. It's getting creepy.
[They exit the chamber.]
INT--SGC LOCKER ROOM
[Daniel walks out of the shower, towel-drying his hair.]
WOMAN'S VOICE
(whispering)
Dr. Jackson.
DANIEL
Out in a minute!
WOMAN'S VOICE
Dr. Jackson.
[Daniel looks around and notices a tap dripping. He walks over to it
and holds his hand beneath the water, then stares at his reflection in
the mirror.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Carter finds Daniel as he is leaving the locker room.]
CARTER
Daniel.
DANIEL
Were you calling me just now?
CARTER
No.
DANIEL
You weren't calling my name in the locker-room a minute ago?
CARTER
No, it wasn't me. General Hammond's waiting for us in the briefing
room.
[As Carter walks away, Daniel gives her strange stare.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
FRAISER
The Goa'uld died before their hosts. We know this due to a unique
protein marker left in Goa'uld bodies, or host bodies, after a
Goa'uld dies.
CARTER
(to Fraiser)
The same protein marker that was left in my body after Jolinar was
killed.
FRAISER
Yes.
HAMMOND
How did they die, Doctor?
FRAISER
Well at this point, sir, I can't really give you an accurate answer,
and I may never be able to.
HAMMOND
Why not?
FRAISER
As with Major Carter, when these Goa'uld symbiotes die they rapidly
decayed and were absorbed by the host. There's no Goa'uld corpse for
me to study.
O'NEILL
What about bio-warfare? Poison, disease, that kind of thing?
TEAL'C
The Goa'uld are immune to such things.
DANIEL
What about the hosts?
FRAISER
The humans were normal, no wounds, no infections.
DANIEL
Ok, then why are they dead?
FRAISER
According to Teal'c, the door was disabled from the inside. Locked
in with no food, no water, they probably died of starvation.
HAMMOND
Right now, I'm more concerned with who killed the Goa'uld and why.
TEAL'C
The System Lords would be the mostly likely suspects.
O'NEILL
But if the door was disabled from the inside how'd the perp, or
perps, get out?
CARTER
Maybe the assassins weren't visible and we're the ones who let them
out.
O'NEILL
Reetou. You think Reetou were in there?
TEAL'C
Reetou would not spare the host. Reetou weaponry does much damage to
the human body.
O'NEILL
Well there you go.
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson, what about that Goa'uld tablet device?
[As Daniel is about to reply, the Stargate begins to dial up, and he
appears to lose his train of thought.]
VOICE OVER SPEAKERS
Incoming traveler.
DANIEL
(to Hammond)
Um, it's a Goa'uld dialect akin to Latin. From what Teal'c and I
have made out so far, it's some sort of attack plan. I'm...still
trying to figure out how to scroll to the next page, if there is a
next page.
HAMMOND
Dr. Jackson, I want you to make translating that tablet your top
priority.
DANIEL
Yes, sir.
HAMMOND
Dismissed.
[As everyone begins to file out of the room, Daniel goes over to the
window and looks down at the Gate room. O'Neill stands at his side.]
VOICE OVER SPEAKERS
SG-7 returning.
[As Daniel looks on, he sees the Linvris' corpses walking down the ramp
in the place of SG-7. He glances at O'Neill, but when the Colonel
doesn't react, Daniel looks back at the Gate room and this time sees
only SGC soldiers.]
INT--SGC DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel is sitting at his desk, attempting to translate the tablet they
retrieved from the Linvris' chamber. He takes a tablet and a drink of
water.]
DANIEL
To enter by infiltration. Infiltration.
VOICE
(whispering)
Daniel. Daniel.
[Daniel hears the sound of a Stargate dialing up coming from his
closet. He pulls the doors of his closet open and sees the Stargate's
event horizon.]
VOICE
Join with us, Daniel. Step through the Gate, Daniel.
DANIEL
This isn't real.
[As he puts his hand into the event horizon, he is suddenly grabbed by
one of the dead Linvris.]
DANIEL
(screaming)
Help! Somebody help!
[The face of one of the corpses appears, and Daniel is pulled into the
event horizon.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel wakes up in one of the infirmary beds. He sees O'Neill playing
with a bag full of IV solution. O'Neill, seeing him awake, wanders
over.]
O'NEILL
Hello.
DANIEL
Hello.
O'NEILL
What happened?
DANIEL
Do you believe in ghosts?
O'NEILL
Uh...no.
DANIEL
Well, neither do I. Which means there has to be a logical
explanation.
O'NEILL
For what?
[He sits down next to Daniel's bed.]
DANIEL
When we were in the Linvris chamber, I felt something brush by me.
And I've heard voices. And I keep seeing the dead Goa'uld from the
massacre.
O'NEILL
Where?
DANIEL
Well last night they were in my closet, in like a...Stargate event
horizon without the Gate.
O'NEILL
In your closet?
DANIEL
Yes. I don't think they're really dead.
O'NEILL
Who? The stiffs in the morgue?
DANIEL
No, the nine Goa'uld that were using them as hosts. I translated a
phrase on that tablet that I thought meant attack, but when I
refined the translation I realized it means to enter by
infiltration.
O'NEILL
And you think that's what they're doing?
DANIEL
Yes.
O'NEILL
Through your closet?
DANIEL
Teal'c said the Linvris were being hunted by the System Lords,
right? Now what if they used some sort of technology to transform
their bodies into...I don't know, energy...or something.
O'NEILL
Energy?
DANIEL
Or something. I don't know exactly how, Sam can figure that part
out. The point is, they're here. They've entered by infiltration,
and now they want me as a host.
O'NEILL
(skeptically)
All nine of them?
DANIEL
That sounds crazy, huh?
O'NEILL
Um, yeah, you've got to admit there's some holes in your theory
here.
DANIEL
Well it's a theory, not a proof.
O'NEILL
Why are you the only one who can see them? Why didn't they come
through my closet...aside from the fact that yours is cleaner?
DANIEL
I don't know. The only other theory I can come up with is that I'm
having some sort of nervous breakdown. Heh heh.
O'NEILL
Or something.
DANIEL
(echoing him)
Or something.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[O'Neill enters the briefing room, but pauses when he sees Dr.
MacKenzie.]
O'NEILL
Dr. MacKenzie.
MACKENZIE
Colonel.
O'NEILL
I'm not going to enjoy this, am I?
HAMMOND
Part of Dr. MacKenzie's work involves analyzing psychological data
from SG units, specifically looking for common side affects to Gate
travel. Dr. Jackson's episode yesterday may have uncovered a serious
one.
MACKENZIE
(to O'Neill)
Dr. Fraiser's been treating you for headaches lately, hasn't she?
[O'Neill looks at Dr. Fraiser, who is sitting next to Dr. MacKensie.
She looks away.]
O'NEILL
Yes. What's that got to do with Daniel?
MACKENZIE
Well you're not the only one. Fifty-three percent of SG field
personnel also have a history of them.
O'NEILL
A lot of people get headaches. What's your point?
MACKENZIE
Dr. Jackson has experienced what I characterize as a first break
psychotic episode, which may be manifesting full-blown
hebephrenic-schizophrenia.
FRAISER
Migraines are often one of the first signs.
O'NEILL
Wait a minute. Daniel's a schizophrenic, and it's caused by...the
Stargate?
FRAISER
It's the only logical explanation we have right now, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Well it sounds fairly theoretical to me. Does anybody think it could
be stress?
FRAISER
As much as I'd like to think that's all it is, the evidence just
doesn't point that way. Daniel has paranoid delusions, auditory and
visual hallucinations.
MACKENZIE
Dr. Jackson's dopamine levels have increased in the left hemisphere
of his brain. All these symptoms are textbook schizophrenia.
CARTER
I don't understand how this could happen without us noticing signs.
FRAISER
Nobody knows the exact cause of schizophrenia. Some cases are
genetic, but there's no history of it in Daniel's family. When it's
not genetic, it's environmental and...the Stargate is a plausible
environmental cause.
CARTER
I've been through the Gate as many times as Daniel, and I don't have
headaches.
FRAISER
Well your body may have some kind of immunity, possibly due to
Jolinar.
O'NEILL
All right, let's say for the sake of argument that it is the
Stargate, a theory to which I do not ascribe, then why don't we just
put a little sign at the base of the ramp that says 'Gate travel may
be hazardous to your health.' I can live with that.
CARTER
So can I, sir.
HAMMOND
The Air Force can't. I can't risk any SG officer having delusions in
the middle of a crisis. Therefore, as we speak, all outstanding SG
teams are being recalled for evaluation.
CARTER
(to Hammond)
You're shutting down the whole program.
HAMMOND
Only until Dr. MacKenzie and their teams submit their report. If his
theory is proven correct, limits will be placed on the number of
missions. Until then, the Stargate is closed.
O'NEILL
General...
HAMMOND
(firmly)
There is no debate, Colonel.
O'NEILL
(mouthing the words)
Of course not.
CARTER
(to Hammond)
What about Daniel, sir?
MACKENZIE
For now we're going to medicate him and let him rest in one of the
VIP rooms.
FRAISER
But if his symptoms persist or he becomes a threat to himself or
anyone else...we'll have to commit him to Mental Health.
INT--SGC VIP ROOM
[Daniel and O'Neill are in the middle of a game of chess.]
DANIEL
Check.
[O'Neill moves his king out of check.]
DANIEL
Oh.
O'NEILL
What? Didn't see that?
DANIEL
Actually I was oh-ing about something else.
(he makes another move)
Checkmate. I should have done that two moves ago, I don't know what
I was thinking.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well, you're a little off.
DANIEL
I don't feel off. I feel...I feel fine! No headaches, no tension, I
mean I feel...normal.
O'NEILL
That's because it was just stress. And I have a very calming effect
on stressed out people. How about a game of gin?
DANIEL
I'm not very good at gin.
O'NEILL
Good! Get the cards.
[As Daniel rises, he hears the sound of a Stargate dialing up coming
from the cupboard. He glances back at O'Neill, but the Colonel doesn't
hear anything. Daniel yanks the cupboard doors open, but is relieved
when he sees no event horizon inside. He takes out the cards and
returns to the table. He suddenly hears a Goa'uld squealing and looks
across the table to see one crawling up O'Neill's arm as O'Neill
shuffles the cards.]
DANIEL
Jack?
O'NEILL
Yeah?
[Since it's obvious the Colonel is not seeing the Goa'uld, Daniel
hastily looks away.]
DANIEL
It's nothing.
O'NEILL
You all right?
DANIEL
I'm fine. How are you feeling?
[The Goa'uld continues up O'Neill's arm and starts to enter the back of
O'Neill's neck, causing the colonel's eyes to glow.]
O'NEILL
Good. Real good.
[Daniel suddenly jumps up and makes a grab for the Goa'uld.]
DANIEL
There's a Goa'uld in you! I've got to get it out!
[O'Neill dodges him and backs away.]
O'NEILL
Daniel! Daniel, there's no Goa'uld in me!
[Daniel stops as he realizes what he's doing.]
DANIEL
I'm sorry. I saw it. I saw it.
[He starts to act faint.]
O'NEILL
You all right? Come on.
[Daniel collapses, O'Neill helps him to the floor.]
O'NEILL
All right, easy, easy. Put your head down.
[As the Colonel heads for the phone, something shifts beneath Daniel's
skin, moving across his face.]
INT--MENTAL HEALTH
[An aide unlocks the door to a white, padded room and MacKenzie,
closely followed by O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c, enters.]
MACKENZIE
Don't expect much. If he becomes agitated, call the aides.
[As MacKenzie leaves, the remaining members of SG-1 see Daniel sitting
on the floor, dressed in white scrubs.]
DANIEL
Jack?
[Daniel's vision is blurred.]
CARTER
It's us, Daniel. Can't you see us?
DANIEL
I was just making sure you weren't figments of my...mind. They took
away my glasses in case I broke the lenses and uh...tried to...hurt
myself.
O'NEILL
They treating you ok?
DANIEL
Yeah.
[He starts to cry.]
DANIEL
I'm sorry.
O'NEILL
For what?
DANIEL
For being such a head case.
CARTER
It's not your fault, Daniel.
TEAL'C
Colonel O'Neill believes it has something to do with the Linvris.
O'NEILL
You remember in that chamber you said you felt something brush by
you?
DANIEL
Yes. It was them. I know you don't believe me, but I felt them.
[He starts hearing noises.]
DANIEL
They heard me.
[Daniel hears footsteps. He scurries to the corner of the room and
huddles there.]
DANIEL
They're coming! They're coming.
TEAL'C
Only your friends are here, Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
They're coming. I hear footsteps! Footsteps.
O'NEILL
(impatiently)
Daniel! There are no footsteps. Stay with us!
DANIEL
Footsteps!
[He sees one of the dead Linvris standing at Teal'c's shoulder and
starts laughing hysterically.]
DANIEL
I told you, it's one of them. He's right there.
[He points to the dead Linvris.]
TEAL'C
There is no one at my side, Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
Yes there is.
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Want to get the aides?
[As Carter knocks on the door, Daniel lunges at the dead Linvris, but
Teal'c catches hold of him. Something crawls out of Daniel and goes
into Teal'c's hand. Daniel pulls himself out of Teal'c's grip and backs
away as the aides arrive.]
DANIEL
Something just went inside Teal'c!
O'NEILL
You're hallucinating, Daniel.
DANIEL
Don't just stand there, get it out of him!
[As the aides pin Daniel to the floor and give him an injection, he
hears Ma'chello's voice.]
MA'CHELLO
You have delivered me to the vile Goa'uld so that I may destroy it.
DANIEL
Ma'chello.
MACKENZIE
Ok, let's raise the dose. Five mils at four hour intervals.
DANIEL
Ma'chello.
[He loses consciousness. Carter and O'Neill look on, distressed and
concerned.]
INT--SGC
[The remaining members of SG-1 exit an elevator.]
CARTER
God, I hate seeing him like that.
O'NEILL
Nothing worse than losing your mind and knowing it's happening.
[Teal'c suddenly doubles up in pain and collapses over a desk.]
O'NEILL
Infirmary!
[O'Neill and Carter support Teal'c as they take him to the infirmary.]
INT--MENTAL HEALTH
[In his room, Daniel is dreaming of SG-1's mission to Ma'chello's
world.]
MA'CHELLO
Yes! Inventions to fight the Goa'uld.
DANIEL
Ma'chello.
MA'CHELLO
Yes! Yes, inventions to fight the Goa'uld!
[In his dream, Daniel sees again the creature pass from him into
Teal'c's hand. He wakes up in his room, goes over to the door and
starts banging on it for attention.]
DANIEL
Dr. MacKenzie! Dr. MacKenzie!
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Teal'c is lying in an infirmary bed as Dr. Fraiser presents her
findings to O'Neill and General Hammond.]
FRAISER
Teal'c's symbiote is dying. I can't explain why.
O'NEILL
(to Teal'c)
Teal'c, what about that...Kel'no'reem thing?
[Teal'c weakly shakes his head.]
HAMMOND
(to Fraiser)
Is he having hallucinations like Dr. Jackson?
FRAISER
No. His dopamine levels are normal. Besides, Daniel didn't have the
same physical symptoms. They seem to be unrelated.
O'NEILL
What are we talking about, time wise?
FRAISER
Without another symbiote...a day...two, maybe less. Even if we found
another larval Goa'uld in time, there's no telling if it would
survive either.
INT--MENTAL HEALTH
[Dr. MacKenzie, two aides, and a nurse enter Daniel's room.]
MACKENZIE
Dr. Jackson.
DANIEL
Just uh...one second.
MACKENZIE
Look, Daniel, it's time for your meds.
DANIEL
Uh, I don't uh...I don't need anymore drugs. What I need is to get
the ones you've got in my system out of my system.
MACKENZIE
No, Daniel, you need rest.
DANIEL
I think I've rested enough. Just tell me one thing, is Teal'c sick?
MACKENZIE
Not that I'm aware of. I haven't been to the SGC.
[Daniel hits the wall in frustration.]
MACKENZIE
Dr. Jackson, I insist you calm yourself, otherwise I'll have to have
you restrained and further sedated.
DANIEL
Why are you so quick to jump to the conclusion I'm crazy? That I'm
dangerous, I'm out of control? It's 'cause I'm kinda acting that
way, aren't I? I just...I just need to get these drugs out of my
system. Look, Doctor, I know you probably hear this from patients
all the time, but I think I'm cured.
MACKENZIE
You're right, I hear it all the time. I'm afraid it doesn't work
that way. You don't get well from something like this overnight.
DANIEL
(trying to reason with MacKenzie)
You do if there was an alien organism inside you making you think
that you were sick when you really weren't.
MACKENZIE
Mmm. And you...found this out...how?
DANIEL
Ma'chello told me.
MACKENZIE
Ma'chello?
DANIEL
He's an alien old man we met on P3C-599.
MACKENZIE
Dr. Jackson, you haven't had any visitors.
DANIEL
No, of course I haven't. You see, Ma'chello is dead.
MACKENZIE
Dead? Yet he told you there was someone inside you making you appear
crazy?
DANIEL
That's a good point. I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't buy that if I were
you either. Just do me one favor, ok? Contact the SGC, find out if
Teal'c is sick. If he is...promise me you'll let me talk to Jack
O'Neill.
[MacKenzie appears to consider this.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Dr. Fraiser is examining Teal'c as Carter and O'Neill watch. General
Hammond enters the room.]
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
Dr. MacKenzie seems to think there's some sort of change with Dr.
Jackson.
FRAISER
A change, sir?
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill)
He's requesting that you come out there, Colonel.
[O'Neill immediately leaves the room.]
INT--MENTAL HEALTH
[An aide lets O'Neill into Daniel's room, and Daniel gets to his feet.]
O'NEILL
Hey, Daniel.
DANIEL
You don't uh...you don't need to walk on eggshells any more. I'm
better.
O'NEILL
So I hear. Ah, it's not that I doubt you, but, um, why do you think
it's happened all of sudden?
DANIEL
I don't completely understand it myself, but...I saw something come
out of me and go into Teal'c. And then I heard Ma'chello's voice.
O'NEILL
Uh, Ma'chello?
DANIEL
Just...just hear me out. I'm guessing it wasn't actually Ma'chello.
It was probably some sort of technological or organic recording. And
it said something about delivering Ma'chello to the vile Goa'uld,
which made me start thinking. Maybe I had some sort of...Goa'uld
killing invention inside of me. One of Ma'chello's inventions.
O'NEILL
And that's what made you...nuts?
DANIEL
Well since I don't have a Goa'uld, a side effect of this invention
must make normal people act like they're...
[He gestures with his hands.]
O'NEILL
(mouthing)
Nuts?
DANIEL
Schizophrenic. Look, Teal'c is sick, right?
O'NEILL
Right.
DANIEL
Well, he does have a Goa'uld.
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Daniel is standing over Teal'c, who is still very ill.]
FRAISER
(to Daniel)
Your dopamine levels are back to normal.
DANIEL
I'm...back to normal.
CARTER
Ok, let's say your concept about Ma'chello's Goa'uld killing
invention is right, why did it take so long to go into Teal'c?
DANIEL
I don't know. Maybe it needed a close proximity to sense his Goa'uld
larva.
[O'Neill doesn't appear entirely convinced.]
DANIEL
Look, I had a lot of time locked in that little room to think about
this. It makes sense. Why am I back to normal? And, coincidentally,
hours after touching me, Teal'c is sick.
O'NEILL
All right, why didn't I get sick when we were playing cards the
other night, and you were jumping all over me?
DANIEL
Because last I heard you don't have Goa'uld larva.
FRAISER
All right, but Daniel look, we ran every test we have. MRI, CAT
scan, x-rays, full blood workup. There is nothing foreign in Teal'c
or his symbiote.
DANIEL
It's there. I know it! I saw it.
CARTER
Daniel, those bodies had only been there a month. Ma'chello's been
dead for six months. How could he be responsible?
DANIEL
What if he planted those killing devices there six months ago? Or a
year ago? And the Linvris walk into their meeting and...
O'NEILL
Like...a land mine.
[Carter goes over to the computer.]
DANIEL
(to O'Neill)
Yes. World War One mines are still going off in France today even
though the soldiers that planted them are long since dead.
CARTER
(to Daniel)
You think that Ma'chello made this thing, right?
DANIEL
Right.
CARTER
We crated off everything in Ma'chello's laboratory to Area 51 and
it's all in our database. Let's see if we can find something that
looks familiar.
[She calls up the images of Ma'chello's inventions as the others gather
around.]
O'NEILL
Right there! Right there, back it up.
[She returns to a picture of a tablet and a page turning device.]
DANIEL
I picked that up in the Linvris chamber.
[Carter calls up another picture with a dozen page turning devices.]
FRAISER
Why did he make so many page turning devices?
CARTER
Could be our land mine.
INT--SGC LABORATORY
[The tablet and a page turning device are sealed in a glass quarantine
chamber. Carter and Dr. Fraiser are using gloves to examine the items
as O'Neill looks on. Daniel is observing them from a room above.]
FRAISER
On the right is the PTD from the Linvris and the one on the left is
from Area 51.
CARTER
They look exactly like the one we found on Argos. The Linvris
probably thought it was one of their own.
O'NEILL
It's a good way to hide a mine.
CARTER
Yeah. The question is, how do we set it off?
[Carter experimentally taps one of the page turning devices with an
instrument but nothing happens.]
FRAISER
No. Ok, let's see what happens when we use it on the tablet.
[Carter runs the page turning device over the tablet and 10 organisms
suddenly slither out.]
FRAISER
There they are. I am counting five...ten altogether. So if all PTDs
are the same we're looking at about ten per device.
DANIEL
(over the intercom)
That explains how I got infected. There were nine Linvris.
CARTER
(to Daniel)
And when you activated the device, the last one went into you.
FRAISER
Ok, let's try and immobilize one and put it under the scope.
[Two of the creatures suddenly penetrate Carter's gloves, while the
others escape the glass chamber.]
FRAISER
The gloves are breached!
[A warning siren starts up.]
CARTER
Whoa!
[Carter and Dr. Fraiser back away, rubbing at their arms, but it's too
late.]
O'NEILL
(jumping back)
Whoa!
DANIEL
(into the intercom system)
General Hammond to B-Hazmat Observation right away!
[O'Neill reaches for a hose, but three of the creatures swarm up it and
go into him. Dr. Fraiser watches as one of the creatures moves beneath
her skin and burrows up her arm.]
O'NEILL
Aaagh!
FRAISER
No!
[Carter can only watch as hers follow suit.]
O'NEILL
Great.
INT--SGC
[The alarm is still going off as the base is sealed.]
INT--SGC LABORATORY
[General Hammond arrives in the observation deck.]
DANIEL
(to Hammond)
We have a breach.
HAMMOND
(to Fraiser)
Is there any chance of further contamination to the base?
FRAISER
Judging by what happened with Daniel, sir, as long as we stay in
here and we don't go near anybody else, the base is probably secure.
HAMMOND
(over the intercom)
Dr. Warner to B-Hazmat 3 Observation Stand. Containment team to
B-Hazmat 3 for containment integrity scan.
DANIEL
There has to be an answer in this tablet.
[He uses the computer to call up a picture of the tablet brought back
from Ma'chello's laboratory.]
O'NEILL
Is there anything we can do from in here?
FRAISER
Nothing, Colonel. All the specimens are inside us. And since we're
infected by multiple organisms we can expect our symptoms to be
rapidly acute.
[She slides down to sit on the floor.]
O'NEILL
I'd like to apologize in advance for anything I may say, or do, that
could be construed as offensive, as I slowly go NUTS!
FRAISER
Likewise, Colonel.
CARTER
Colonel? Janet?
O'NEILL
Carter?
[He starts to hallucinate, seeing Carter's eyes glow. He slides to the
floor.]
CARTER
Sir, there's nothing wrong with me.
DANIEL
(to Carter)
Sam, you've got four of those things in you.
CARTER
I know that, but I feel fine.
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
Are you seeing or hearing any of this stuff?
CARTER
No, sir I feel completely normal. Somehow I must be immune.
[Dr. Warner arrives in the Observation Room.]
WARNER
Dr. Fraiser, what can I do to help?
FRAISER
Uh, not much, I'm afraid.
CARTER
(to Warner)
Doctor, there's nothing wrong with me.
(to Hammond)
Sir, I'd like Dr. Warner to take some tests, try to figure out why.
HAMMOND
I'm afraid that's not possible. That would risk another person being
contaminated, if not the entire base.
DANIEL
Sir, those organisms left my body. I might be immune. I may be the
only one who can go in there and help them.
HAMMOND
We don't know that, Dr. Jackson. I can't let you risk it.
(to Carter)
Dr. Warner will stay here. We'll get whoever else you think can
help, but you're going to have to figure it out in there.
CARTER
I understand, sir.
[She collapses against the table in sudden pain.]
CARTER
Whoa. Ah, I think I spoke too soon.
DANIEL
What's wrong?
CARTER
Oh god, something's happening.
[Four of the organisms drip out of her ear and fall to the floor.
Carter bends down and pokes at them with her finger.]
CARTER
I think they're dead. Daniel, I could have sworn I heard...
DANIEL
Ma'chello?
CARTER
Yes. He said my Goa'uld captor is dead. But I don't have a Goa'uld.
DANIEL
You did.
CARTER
That has to be it. Janet said that when a Goa'uld dies, it dissolves
into a host and leaves a unique protein marker.
DANIEL
So these Goa'uld killing inventions died because they detected a
protein marker? Well, that doesn't make any sense. Why isn't Jack
immune? He should have some sort of protein marker left over from
Hathor's Goa'uld.
CARTER
No. No, that Goa'uld left Colonel O'Neill's body and died before it
had a chance to take over.
[She crouches down next to Dr. Fraiser.]
CARTER
Janet, can you hear me? Can we extract my blood and inject it into
everyone that's infected?
WARNER
No, your blood types don't match. You'd have to separate the protein
from the rest of the blood.
CARTER
(to Warner)
Ok, how do I do that?
WARNER
You don't have the necessary equipment in there. Even if you did, it
would take weeks.
CARTER
Come on, there's got to be a way! We've got all this stuff!
WARNER
I'm sorry, but you need to use high-pressure liquid chromatography
to separate and isolate the protein factor from the rest of the
blood. That would yield thirty to forty proteins. Then you'd have to
test each one of them to find...
CARTER
Ok! I get the point.
FRAISER
(weakly)
Centrifuge.
CARTER
(to Fraiser)
What? What about the centrifuge?
FRAISER
Put as much blood as possible in centrifuge.
[Carter quickly starts to draw some of her own blood. Dr. Fraiser
starts to tear off her clothes. O'Neill lies huddled in a fetal
position in obvious pain.]
WARNER
You're wasting your time, Major.
CARTER
(to Fraiser)
Ok. Now what?
FRAISER
(still stripping)
It's too hot! It's too hot! They're trying to suffocate us!
CARTER
Janet!
[Dr. Fraiser begins to hallucinate, and she sees Carter's eyes glow.]
FRAISER
No! You're a Goa'uld! Stay away!
CARTER
I'm not a Goa'uld, Janet. It's me, Sam. I'm your friend.
[Dr. Fraiser forces herself to be calm in order to tell Carter what to
do next.]
FRAISER
Put...the test tube...in the centrifuge.
[Carter does as Dr. Fraiser instructs and sets the centrifuge going.
When it's finished, she takes the test tube of her blood back to Dr.
Fraiser, who is now lying on the floor, using her lab coat as a
pillow.]
CARTER
Janet. Get back with me here. We're trying to separate that protein
from my blood, remember? The centrifuge just finished. Now what?
WARNER
(to Carter)
Major, you're wasting your time. If she thinks there's another way,
she's not in her right mind. There's only one way to separate that
protein.
FRAISER
(weakly)
You don't need to...Just need to separate red blood cells.
DANIEL
What? What's she talking about?
WARNER
I see where you're going. I see where you're going! Don't even try
to separate the proteins. Just separate the rejectable parts and
give them all the rest.
[Dr. Fraiser manages to nod her agreement.]
DANIEL
What?
WARNER
(to Daniel)
The part that makes blood types incompatible is just the red blood
cells and a few things in the plasma. If we can get those out, the
rest should be safe.
FRAISER
Quick-freeze.
CARTER
(to Warner)
Quick-freeze?
WARNER
Major, look in the freezer over there. See if there's any dry ice.
[Carter opens the freezer door.]
CARTER
Yeah, there's a ton of it.
WARNER
Good, now follow my directions very carefully.
INT--SGC LABORATORY
[Carter puts the treated blood into two syringes.]
WARNER
Looks good. Pick your first patient.
CARTER
(to Fraiser, who appears to be barely conscious)
This was your idea. You wanna be first?
[She injects Dr. Fraiser then goes over to O'Neill, who is lying on the
floor.]
O'NEILL
(to Carter)
You look terrible.
CARTER
Thank you, sir. I need to give you a shot, will you let me do that?
[She gives him the shot, then returns to Dr. Fraiser.]
CARTER
Janet?
FRAISER
Uh, I'm hearing...
CARTER
Hearing Ma'chello?
FRAISER
Yeah. Aah!
[The creatures drip out of her ear, as do O'Neill's. He picks one up,
then flicks it away in disgust. In the Observation Room, Warner,
Hammond and Daniel exchange smiles of relief.]
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[SG-1 and Hammond gather around Teal'c's bed as Dr. Fraiser injects the
protein into his IV.]
FRAISER
Ok. Well, I don't know if this is going to work. He'll have the
marker, but he'll still have a Goa'uld larva. Depends on how smart
Ma'chello made the little beggars.
[Teal'c groans, then opens his eyes.]
TEAL'C
(whispering)
Ma'chello.
[The team exchanges smiles of relief. The dead organism drips out of
Teal'c's ear and is suctioned away by Dr. Fraiser.]
