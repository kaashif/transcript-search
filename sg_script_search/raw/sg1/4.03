TEASER
FADE IN
INT--GATE ROOM
[The Gate is activating and the iris is closed. Carter, Teal'c and
Hammond are waiting in the Gate room as O'Neill and Daniel walk in.
Daniel is putting his jacket on.]
HAMMOND
Dr Jackson, Colonel.
O'NEILL
General.
DANIEL
The message I got was pretty vague.
HAMMOND
So was the transmission we got from the Tok'ra.
DANIEL
Did they say who was coming?
HAMMOND
No.
O'NEILL
Did they say why?
CARTER
No, sir.
O'NEILL
Well you see that's rude, I hate that!
TECHNICIAN
(on intercom)
Receiving Tok'ra IDC, opening iris.
[The iris opens.]
O'NEILL
In fact the Tok'ra are starting to annoy me in general.
CARTER
Sir?
O'NEILL
Don't get me wrong Carter, your dad's great, I love him like a
brother. But it's just that every time they show up it seems like
there's all kinds of...
[Two Tok'ra step through the Gate. One male, the other a beautiful
woman whom O'Neill stares at.]
DANIEL
Yep, that looks like trouble to me.
[The two Tok'ra walk down the ramp. The male Tok'ra is carrying a large
box.]
ANISE
The High Council of the Tok'ra sends its greetings.
HAMMOND
Welcome, I'm General Hammond. Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson, Major
Carter and Teal'c.
ANISE
This is Marnon. You may call me Anise.
[She gestures to the male Tok'ra.]
DANIEL
Anise?
ANISE
It means noble strength.
DANIEL
I'm Daniel, it means err...god is my judge.
[O'Neill looks amused.]
O'NEILL
I'm Jack. It means...err...what's in the box?
INT--BRIEFING ROOM
[Anise opens the box and removes a device.]
ANISE
These armbands were recently discovered among some ancient ruins on
a remote planet.
DANIEL
I don't recognize the symbols. May I...?
[He gestures at the armbands and Anise passes them to him.]
ANISE
The language belongs to a race called the Atoneeks. Their existence
and demise predates the Goa'uld.
[Carter looks at the armband.]
CARTER
Atoneeks, I think Jolinar knew about these. They're supposed to give
the wearer incredible speed and strength, right?
ANISE
Yes. Many thought it was just a myth. Still, the Goa'uld and the
Tok'ra have both sought these devices for some time.
DANIEL
Obviously not a myth.
ANISE
The Tok'ra were very excited when I found them.
DANIEL
You found them?
ANISE
My area of expertise is ancient cultures.
DANIEL
Oh, mine too!
ANISE
Yes, I know.
[O'Neill looks at Daniel, who looks puzzled.]
ANISE
We hoped the devices would provide our operatives with a great new
physical advantage in the fight against the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
However?
[Anise holds the device up and places it on her arm, but it will not
work on her.]
DANIEL
They don't work for you.
ANISE
Our top scientific minds have researched the technology at length.
To the best of our knowledge the devices should work, however
something causes them to reject the Tok'ra physiology.
TEAL'C
Your symbiote.
ANISE
That is a likely assumption.
TEAL'C
Then the device will most likely be ineffective on me as well.
ANISE
Yes, which is why I brought only three.
CARTER
Err...I still have a protein marker left by Jolinar.
ANISE
Hopefully that will have no effect.
DANIEL
Incredible speed and strength.
ANISE
In fact, according to the inscriptions they should greatly increase
all of your natural abilities.
O'NEILL
That's kinda cool.
[He looks at Daniel and Carter.]
ANISE
In the interests of the Tok'ra/Human alliance, I expected you would
cooperate.
HAMMOND
Couldn't we take some time to learn a little more about these
things? Perhaps Major Carter and Dr Jackson...
ANISE
I had hoped to begin human trial experiments immediately.
[O'Neill looks suspicious.]
O'NEILL
What's the rush?
ANISE
If you are not willing to trust us and participate, I will find
human subjects on another planet.
[She puts the armband back inside the box. O'Neill and Hammond glance
at each other.]
O'NEILL
Fine.
[Anise blinks and her host emerges.]
FREYA
Colonel, please forgive the scientist in Anise. She has worked very
hard for this. I assure you that every safety precaution will be
taken.
[O'Neill weighs the situation up.]
[Freya blinks and Anise takes over.]
ANISE
What is your answer?
END OF TEASER
INT--EXERCISE ROOM
[O'Neill is sitting on a bed. Anise and Dr Fraiser are present. Anise
places a biosensor on O'Neill's chest.]
ANISE
This is a Tok'ra biosensor. It will monitor every aspect of your
physiological condition.
O'NEILL
Whoa!
ANISE
It will transmit readings to this device where they will be recorded
for the duration of the experiment.
[She indicates a rectangular board.]
O'NEILL
Ok.
[O'Neill picks up the board and he and Fraiser look at it while Anise
fetches the armband.]
ANISE
Ready?
O'NEILL
As I'll ever be.
[Anise places the armband on O'Neill. An indicator on it lights up.]
O'NEILL
What's that mean?
ANISE
The device is working.
O'NEILL
I don't feel like jumping any tall buildings.
ANISE
It may take time for the device to adjust to your body. We believe
it was designed this way to gradually give you the chance to adapt
to your new abilities. In the meantime feel free to move around and
interact with your environment as you normally would. The biosensor
will transmit readings over a significant distance.
O'NEILL
Ok.
[He gets off the bed and leaves the room.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN--DAY
INT--SGC GYM
[O'Neill and Teal'c are boxing.]
TEAL'C
Do you still feel no effects from the armband, O'Neill?
O'NEILL
No, and you know something? I'm starting to think this is a crock!
[They continue to box.]
O'NEILL
Come on Teal'c, bring it!
[Teal'c punches O'Neill a little harder and O'Neill punches him back.
The punch is very fast. It knocks Teal'c to the ground and he falls
unconscious.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c?
INT--INFIRMARY
[Teal'c is sitting on a bed surrounded by Fraiser, Anise and O'Neill.
O'Neill is eating something.]
FRAISER
(to Teal'c)
So are you feeling any better?
TEAL'C
I will be fine, Dr Fraiser.
O'NEILL
Teal'c, I'm really sorry.
[Teal'c looks at O'Neill]
TEAL'C
You are not.
O'NEILL
(to Fraiser and Anise)
He's right about that!
[Anise is inputting data into the data-logging machine. She passes him
a small metallic ball.]
ANISE
Please squeeze this.
[O'Neill studies it.]
O'NEILL
What is it?
ANISE
It will measure your strength.
[O'Neill squeezes the ball. The data-logger registers the strength.]
ANISE
Your strength is five times that of a normal human.
O'NEILL
So, no increase then, eh?
[Fraiser rolls her eyes.]
ANISE
Physiology remains otherwise normal.
O'NEILL
Well, I feel good.
[He throws a ball of paper into a small cup on the other side of the
room.]
O'NEILL
Three!
FRAISER
And err, you seem to have developed a bit of a sweet tooth.
[O'Neill looks at her as he eats a candy bar.]
ANISE
Your metabolism is increasing to match the energy that your body now
requires.
[Fraiser looks at the data-logging device.]
FRAISER
You were going to teach me how to read this thing.
ANISE
I will. First, it is time to increase the number of subjects in the
experiment.
[Teal'c looks at O'Neill who is still chewing on a candy bar.]
INT--SGC EXERCISE ROOM
[Fraiser places a biosensor onto Daniel's chest as Anise places an
armband on Carter. O'Neill is sitting in the background eating another
candy bar.]
CARTER
(to Anise)
I don't really feel any different.
O'NEILL
Just wait.
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel is working from a book with a magnifying glass as O'Neill walks
in.]
O'NEILL
Hey.
DANIEL
Hey.
O'NEILL
Notice anything yet?
[Daniel looks at O'Neill eating another candy bar.]
DANIEL
You're eating a lot.
O'NEILL
Huh...give it time.
[He picks up a book and reads it in a matter of seconds. Daniel stares
at him amazed.]
DANIEL
Did you just read that?
O'NEILL
I guess. I don't suppose there's another book around that explains
this book.
DANIEL
What reason did Hobbs give for the fall of the civilization?
O'NEILL
Failing agricultural infrastructure.
DANIEL
Jack, that's unbelievable!
O'NEILL
Hey, it's just theory.
[Daniel attempts to read a book fast but is unable. He becomes
frustrated and stops.]
O'NEILL
Want me to read it to you?
[He offers Daniel some of the candy bar as Daniel stares at him.]
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Fraiser opens the door and enters. The room is in darkness and Carter
is looking through a microscope.]
FRAISER
Sam?
CARTER
Yeah?
FRAISER
What are you doing?
CARTER
Oh, I'm just running a few tests on the material the armband's made
of.
FRAISER
Ah, it's a little dark don't you think?
CARTER
Is it?
[Fraiser turns the lights on.]
CARTER
Oww, that's bright.
FRAISER
Yeah, lights were out.
CARTER
I came in and didn't even realize!
INT--INFIRMARY
[Fraiser is examining Carter's eyes.]
FRAISER
Well, it looks normal to me.
CARTER
I could see in the dark as well as if the light was on.
[Fraiser checks Carter's temperature.]
FRAISER
You're running a slight temperature.
CARTER
Anise is monitoring our vitals.
FRAISER
Yes, I know.
CARTER
You don't trust her biosensors?
FRAISER
No, I'm sure her technology is very advanced and very accurate.
CARTER
So you don't trust her?
FRAISER
I'd like to run a full blood screen.
[Carter rolls her eyes at the suggestion.]
INT--SGC EXERCISE ROOM
[O'Neill is being monitored by Anise whilst on a cycling machine. He is
cycling so fast that his feet are not visible. He slows down and jumps
off the machine.]
ANISE
Very good.
O'NEILL
I'm not even sweating. In fact I think that thing's slowing me down!
[Anise hands O'Neill the strength-testing ball.]
ANISE
Squeeze this.
[He squeezes it so hard that it breaks.]
O'NEILL
Sorry!
INT--DANIEL'S OFFICE
[Daniel is walking about excitedly talking to Anise. He is not wearing
his glasses.]
DANIEL
I mean it's just the most unbelievable incredible thing I've ever
experienced! I mean I've cross-referenced the symbols on the armband
against every written language on earth in an hour!
ANISE
What did you find?
DANIEL
Well nothing...but you see the point is...I can read really fast!
ANISE
Here are my notes on the Atoneeks. I thought you might be
interested.
[Daniel takes the book from her, puzzled.]
DANIEL
You write in a notebook?
ANISE
My host Freya enjoys the tactile sensation of handwriting.
[Daniel speed-reads the book. He looks at the armband.]
DANIEL
The inscription says that with great power comes great
responsibility.
ANISE
And the ability to effect great consequences.
DANIEL
You haven't speculated in here on why the Atoneek became extinct.
ANISE
No, my primary concern up until now was finding the armbands and
then determining they worked.
[A light is illuminated on Daniel's armband. Anise inputs data into the
data-logger. Daniel looks at the armband.]
DANIEL
What does that mean?
INT--INFIRMARY
[Carter, O'Neill and Daniel are waiting with Anise. This lights on all
the armbands are lit.]
ANISE
I believe all the armbands have now reached their maximum potential.
[Fraiser walks in. Hammond is behind her.]
FRAISER
Anise, can I see you a moment?
[Anise walks over to Hammond and Fraiser. Carter, Daniel and O'Neill
wait, looking bored.]
FRAISER
They all have significantly raised body temperatures.
ANISE
They are in no danger!
FRAISER
I disagree, their symptoms are indicative of the presence of a
virus.
ANISE
You are correct. My biodata indicates that the armbands released a
virus into their systems.
HAMMOND
Doesn't that concern you?
ANISE
It must be how the technology accesses the human physiology. It took
a different amount of time in each individual because of each
subject's unique reaction to the virus.
FRAISER
That's all speculation! Major Carter's blood work showed a dangerous
amount of adrenaline in her system.
ANISE
I object to the interference in my experiment.
FRAISER
I object to being kept in the dark about the condition of people
whose health I am responsible for!
ANISE
Are you suggesting I would risk their health?
HAMMOND
Doctor, we're seeing some really interesting results. Are you saying
that we should discontinue the experiment?
FRAISER
Until we know more about the physical effects of this virus, yes! I
say we remove the armbands and we run more tests to make sure that
these changes are not permanent or damaging.
ANISE
General!
HAMMOND
No, I'm sorry. If there's one thing I've learned in my time here is
that there's nothing wrong with a little prudence when dealing with
alien devices.
[Hammond and Fraiser walk into the room where O'Neill, Daniel and
Carter are waiting. Anise follows.]
HAMMOND
Based on Doctor Fraiser's recommendations I've decided to stop the
experiment temporarily.
CARTER
What?
DANIEL
What?
O'NEILL
Why?
[They all look concerned.]
HAMMOND
We'd like to get a better read on exactly what these things are
doing to you.
CARTER
General?
O'NEILL
I'd rather not do that, sir!
FRAISER
I think the armbands may be having a narcotic like effect. Wearing
them may become addictive, it's just one of the things I would like
to rule out.
HAMMOND
Please, take the armbands off.
CARTER
But...
HAMMOND
Are you refusing to comply with a direct order?
[They attempt to take the armbands off but are unable.]
O'NEILL
Err...having a little problem here sir!
HAMMOND
Colonel?
O'NEILL
Having a hard time complying!
[Hammond and Fraiser look at Anise.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Anise and Dr Fraiser are discussing the situation with Hammond.]
FRAISER
We've tried everything short of surgically removing their arms.
HAMMOND
We'll hold that option in reserve.
FREYA
You must admit the positive effect is astonishing.
HAMMOND
As long as there's no downside.
ANISE
There is no evidence of any downside.
FRAISER
Yet!
HAMMOND
(to Anise)
Find a way to get those armbands off my people.
INT--SGC EXERCISE ROOM
[O'Neill is lifting a large set of weights with ease.]
O'NEILL
Teal'c, how much do I have on here?
TEAL'C
It appears to be approximately 600 pounds, O'Neill.
O'NEILL
Really? Not bad!
[He puts the weights down and sits up.]
TEAL'C
Are you not concerned because the armband cannot be removed?
O'NEILL
Nope, this thing's great.
TEAL'C
We will not resume our duties as SG-1 as long as this experiment
continues.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well I'm going to have a little chat with Hammond about that.
[He goes to the punching bag and starts punching it.]
O'NEILL
I mean we should be using these things.
[He punches straight through the bag and Teal'c stares at him. O'Neill
slowly pulls his hand out of the bag.]
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[Carter is typing onto a laptop at an incredible speed. Fraiser
enters.]
FRAISER
Hey!
CARTER
Hey.
FRAISER
What are you working on?
CARTER
I'm writing a book on wormhole physics but this damn computer isn't
fast enough. When the buffer's full I have to wait for it to catch
up!
FRAISER
You know we really could use your help.
CARTER
You just don't get it, Janet. I don't want to take it off.
FRAISER
Ok, I realize they're making you feel really good...
CARTER
Look, I have written a thousand page book in under two hours. This
has been something I've been dying to do but haven't had the time!
FRAISER
Sam!
CARTER
Janet!
[Fraiser stares at Carter then walks off as Carter resumes work on the
book.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[O'Neill is discussing the situation excitedly with Hammond.]
HAMMOND
Absolutely not!
O'NEILL
Oh come on, General, why did we put these things on in the first
place?
HAMMOND
We still aren't sure what the long-term effects will be.
O'NEILL
We shouldn't be sitting around wasting this stuff. We ought to be
out kicking some Goa'uld butt! I mean look at this.
[He kicks the wall and takes a big chunk out of it. Hammond stares at
the wall, shocked at what O'Neill has just done.]
O'NEILL
Sorry about that, General!
HAMMOND
Colonel, I'm concerned that you aren't in full control of your new
abilities.
O'NEILL
Well, you may be right about that. But it's just so damn exciting
sir!
HAMMOND
I'm sure it is.
O'NEILL
And even if we're not in total control, shouldn't we be out there
doing the damage instead of...in your office?
HAMMOND
I'm concerned for your well being, Colonel.
O'NEILL
And I appreciate it, and you're the boss, whatever you say goes. I
just want you to know that we're here for you ready to go...just say
the word!
HAMMOND
Thank you.
O'NEILL
Seriously, say it, say the word.
HAMMOND
Dismissed.
O'NEILL
We can be ready in three seconds...
HAMMOND
Colonel.
O'NEILL
...Two!
HAMMOND
Colonel!
O'NEILL
Heck, we're ready now!
HAMMOND
Jack, please, just get the hell out of my office!
O'NEILL
Yes sir!
[He walks out of the office, clearly frustrated, and sees Siler walking
up the stairs to the briefing room.]
O'NEILL
Hey Siler!
[He pats Siler on the chest and Siler is sent tumbling over the
railings down the stairs. O'Neill stares down at Siler, shocked at his
actions. Hammond comes running out of his office.]
O'NEILL
Oh crap!
[O'Neill looks at Hammond, astonished at his actions, then runs down to
help Siler who is being tended to by others.]
INT--VIP ROOM
[Carter is working on a laptop, Daniel is reading and O'Neill is
sitting, bored, playing with some flags.]
O'NEILL
This is ridiculous, it was an accident.
DANIEL
Siler has a broken arm and a concussion.
O'NEILL
He'll pull through. I sent flowers.
DANIEL
You have to admit it's a little scary, I mean I feel like I could do
anything.
CARTER
Well, all I know is that I'm going to starve to death. I don't know
about you guys, but I am having some serious protein cravings.
O'NEILL
Steak.
DANIEL
I could go for that.
O'NEILL
Big, red juicy meat!
CARTER
O'Malley's in town.
O'NEILL
Let's go.
[They all leave the room.]
INT-SCG CORRIDORS.
[There is a blur of activity as O'Neill, Carter and Daniel run through
the corridors undetected. They run past some guards who only notice a
gust of air, and end up outside the elevator dressed in civilian
clothing.]
O'NEILL
Let's eat!
[They enter the elevator and the doors close.]
EXT--O'MALLEY'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT
INT--RESTAURANT
[Carter, Daniel and O'Neill are sitting around a table.]
O'NEILL
How high do you think that fence was?
DANIEL
Twenty, twenty five feet?
CARTER
I'd say more like thirty.
[A waitress approaches.]
WAITRESS
What can I get you?
O'NEILL
Err...three of the biggest steaks you've got, with everything, rare,
and baked potato.
WAITRESS
You got it!
[She starts to walk off.]
O'NEILL
Excuse me...that was for me!
[The waitress smiles thinking it was a joke.]
DANIEL
Yeah, I'm going to have three as well.
O'NEILL
Four?
DANIEL
Four...Four is good!
CARTER
Me too, and French-fries with mine...oh and a diet soda!
[Daniel and O'Neill look at her.]
CARTER
I like the taste better!
[The waitress takes the menus from them and walks away. O'Neill drinks
a shot.]
CARTER
So has it occurred to anyone that we're defying a direct order?
[O'Neill looks up.]
DANIEL
Well, its not like we haven't defied orders before.
CARTER
Well yeah, but that was to save Earth.
O'NEILL
Earth, steaks, there's a difference?
DANIEL
We'll be back before anyone knows we're gone!
INT--RESTAURANT POOL ROOM
[Carter takes a shot on the pool table and wins the game. She collects
her winnings from her male opponent.]
OPPONENT
How the hell did you do that?
CARTER
Wanna go double or nothing?
OPPONENT
No, I think I'll cut my losses!
DANIEL
Smart move.
[He stands up and walks away smirking.]
OPPONENT
What are you laughing at, you geek?
[Daniel stops and looks at O'Neill.]
O'NEILL
Geek?
[Daniel turns round to look at the man.]
DANIEL
Excuse me?
O'NEILL
Let it go!
DANIEL
(smiling)
No, not this time!
OPPONENT
Yeah, what are you going to do?
[Carter smiles at the man. Two other men surround O'Neill, as two
others do the same to Daniel.]
O'NEILL
Well, this is a cliché!
[Daniel raises his eyebrows at O'Neill]
O'NEILL
Ok.
[He grabs one of the men and throws him across the room.]
EXT--O'MALLEYS RESTAURANT
[The sounds of a bar fight are heard.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is on the telephone.]
HAMMOND
Right, Ok.
[He puts the phone down.]
HAMMOND
I though the devices were supposed to enhance them physically, not
make them stupid!
FRAISER
You'd have to ask Anise about that, sir. All I can tell you is that
their erratic behavior could be explained by an increase of various
hormone levels. You could almost describe it as a sort of
intoxication.
HAMMOND
My concern is how do we contain them, if they are that strong and
that fast?
FRAISER
The concern is greater than that, sir. Blood tests show early
indication of multiple organ failure. The human body wasn't meant to
be put through this!
HAMMOND
Are you saying they'll die if we don't get these things off them?
FRAISER
I believe that the key is the virus the armbands use as an
intermediary. There's no magic pill that'll combat a virus but there
are a few treatments we could try.
HAMMOND
But that's no guarantee?
[Hammond sees SG-1 entering the briefing room accompanied by guards.]
HAMMOND
Thank you, doctor.
[She leaves and Hammond walks into the briefing room where SG-1 minus
Teal'c are standing.]
HAMMOND
Can you explain to me why several witnesses put you people at a
restaurant in town last night?
O'NEILL
Sir...
DANIEL
Sir...
O'NEILL
...I can't tell you how...
DANIEL
...I can explain that!
[Hammond glares at him.]
DANIEL
No, I can't!
CARTER
We were very hungry, sir.
HAMMOND
The report says there was a brawl!
O'NEILL
More of a scuffle, sir.
HAMMOND
You're lucky you didn't kill any of those men!
O'NEILL
No, we were very careful about that, General!
HAMMOND
What am I supposed to do with you people?
O'NEILL
General, I can't tell you how sorry we are, but Carter wanted a
steak.
[Carter looks up, annoyed.]
CARTER
Actually it was your idea...
O'NEILL
My point is, General...
CARTER
(to O'Neill)
Sir!
O'NEILL
...The fact that we were defying orders didn't even occur to us
until we were actually defying.
DANIEL
It's like the armbands are having an effect on our ability to make
rational choices.
[Anise enters the room.]
ANISE
General Hammond, I have received a message from the Tok'ra High
Council.
HAMMOND
What?
ANISE
I reported the progress of the experiment and they have made a
suggestion.
[Hammond walks over to Anise.]
HAMMOND
Regarding?
ANISE
The High Council would like put to forward the idea of putting
SG-1's new skills into practical use.
O'NEILL
(excitedly)
YESSSS...
(he sees Hammond looking at him sternly)
Sir.
HAMMOND
What are they suggesting?
ANISE
We have just received new information regarding a new class of
battleship that Apophis is building.
HAMMOND
Just received?
ANISE
Our internal attempt at sabotage has already failed. However, based
on our intelligence a special covert team could...
[Hammond interrupts her.]
HAMMOND
You've known all along.
ANISE
Excuse me?
HAMMOND
This was the point, wasn't it?
[Anise blinks and the host takes control.]
FREYA
General, I assure you...
HAMMOND
I assure you, I've been at this a long time and I know damn well
when I'm being manipulated!
FREYA
I realize how this must look, however in the interests of the
Tok'ra-Earth alliance...
HAMMOND
Don't give me that load of bunk! Right now I don't think the Tok'ra
have my people's best interests in mind.
FREYA
General, if you believe anything, believe this. If Apophis is
allowed to complete this battle ship it will assure his dominance
over the Goa'uld, your planet and the rest of this galaxy.
[Anise takes control over Freya.]
ANISE
I am sure the High Council will be disappointed. I have downloaded
everything we know about the battleship's construction into your
base computer. Hopefully you will review it and change your mind.
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are listening with interest to the
conversation.]
O'NEILL
General, if I may...
HAMMOND
(to O'Neill, sternly)
No, you may not.
(He turns to the guards)
Take them back to the lock up.
(To SG-1)
For what it's worth, I'm ordering you to cooperate.
[Carter, O'Neill and Daniel are led away. Hammond turns back to stare
at Anise.]
INT--LOCK UP ROOM
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel walk into the room very casually.]
O'NEILL
(to guards)
Dismissed!
[As soon as the guard closes the door all three head for the computer.]
O'NEILL
Let's have a look.
[Carter calls up the information on the battleship and they study
footage of its construction.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is looking at the same image as O'Neill, Carter and Daniel. He
turns the screen around to show Teal'c.]
HAMMOND
So you think we have a problem here?
TEAL'C
This new vessel has several advancements over the Goa'uld mother
ships we have previously engaged in battle. We must stop its
completion.
HAMMOND
I can't send the rest of SG-1 on such a dangerous mission knowing
their judgment is impaired
TEAL'C
I will go alone, then.
HAMMOND
According to the Tok'ra intelligence, the Gate on that planet is
heavily guarded. I doubt very much even you could make it through.
TEAL'C
We must not allow Apophis complete this vessel.
HAMMOND
Let's say I agree, Teal'c. Prove to me it isn't a suicide mission.
[Teal'c stands, nods his head and exits the office.]
INT--LOCK UP ROOM
[Carter, O'Neill and Daniel are looking at a schematic of the
battleship.]
CARTER
The Gate will be heavily guarded, but we should be able to handle
them. Wormhole physics dictate that you exit at the same velocity
that you enter.
DANIEL
(eating a candy bar)
So they'll never know what hit them?
CARTER
Exactly. The facility, however, will be more of a challenge.
O'NEILL
(eating a candy bar)
Can't we just zip in, plant C4 and zip out?
CARTER
Won't do it, sir. The power core of the ship is completely sealed in
trinium. That's what we have to take out...Now hang on. The power
core is linked directly to some kind of liquid cooling system that's
based in the facility. These pipes here lead into it.
O'NEILL
So we zip in, blow the pipes and zip out?
CARTER
The core will overheat and explode. The only problem is there are
force shields protecting this restricted area.
DANIEL
So?
CARTER
So...I see your point.
[O'Neill looks puzzled.]
CARTER
Goa'uld force shields operate on a frequency oscillation principle.
If we were moving fast enough, theoretically we should be able to
see the oscillation interval and run right through.
[O'Neill considers this for a moment.]
O'NEILL
We'll need snacks.
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[The technicians are at their posts. SG-1 zoom in and knock the unaware
technicians unconscious with a drug. Carter works at a console
incredibly fast to lock the room off and dial up the address. The blast
doors close before the surprised guards can act.]
CARTER
Let's go!
[They head to the Gate room. As they are ready to go through the Gate
Teal'c comes into the Gate room, attempting to stop them.]
TEAL'C
O'Neill!
[They all look at him.]
O'NEILL
Not this time, Teal'c.
[Carter, Daniel and O'Neill zoom through the Gate.]
INT-CONTROL ROOM
[Hammond and other staff members enter to find the unconscious
technicians.]
TECHNICIAN
Gate's open, sir.
HAMMOND
Shut it down! Get the blast doors open!
[The technician works at her console.]
TECHNICIAN
I can't, sir. I'm locked out of the system.
[Hammond slaps the intercom.]
HAMMOND
Medical team to the control room!
EXT--BATTLESHIP BUILDING PLANET
[The battleship is under construction some distance from the active
Stargate, which is heavily guarded by Jaffa.]
LEAD JAFFA
Onak kree!
[The Jaffa aim their weapons towards the Stargate. SG-1 come through
the Gate at an immense speed; all that is seen of them is a blur. They
quickly overpower the Jaffa, who manage only a few shots. O'Neill,
Carter and Daniel gather behind the fallen Jaffa before zooming through
the forest towards the battleship.]
INT--ENTRANCE TO THE BATTLESHIP
[Sounds of a scuffle are heard as SG-1 overpower the Jaffa posted at
the entrance. They make their way through the corridors, stopping when
they see two Jaffa carrying weapons grade Naquadah around a corner.]
O'NEILL
It takes two guys to carry that?
CARTER
Weapons grade Naquadah is extremely dense. Sir, do you realize how
many Naquadah reactors a single bar like that could power?
O'NEILL
No.
CARTER
A lot!
DANIEL
I'll get it. Meet you back here!
[He runs off after the Jaffa. O'Neill and Carter continue on towards
the power core. They stop and Carter becomes dizzy.]
CARTER
Whoa, sir, is it hot?
O'NEILL
A little bit. You all right?
[She takes her hat off and runs her fingers through her hair.]
CARTER
Fine. The force shield should be somewhere around here.
[She walks down the corridor into the force shield.]
O'NEILL
Heads up!
[They take a run up and then run through the force shield's
oscillations into the power core. They stare around the massive
chamber.]
O'NEILL
Whoa!
[O'Neill looks at his watch.]
O'NEILL
Five minutes.
CARTER
Right, if the cooling system goes down it should take about ten
minutes for the power core to go critical. That gives us about 15
minutes total to get back to the Gate.
O'NEILL
Whatever!
[He runs off to plant the C4 explosive, Carter follows.]
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[Daniel is running slowly down the corridor carrying the Naquadah. He
appears to be struggling with it and is out of breath. O'Neill and
Carter are heard running up to him.]
CARTER
Did you get the Naquadah?
[Daniel turns round to them.]
DANIEL
(out of breath)
It's err...in the pack.
O'NEILL
Great, let's go!
[O'Neill and Carter run off.]
DANIEL
Err...Actually...this is err...getting kinda heavy!
[As O'Neill and Carter head round a corner, the sound of Daniel
collapsing is heard. They run back to him. He is lying motionless on
the floor.]
O'NEILL
Daniel?
CARTER
What's going on?
DANIEL
(strained)
I can't move!
[O'Neill removes the backpack from Daniel's shoulders. Suddenly the
armband falls off Daniel and he passes out.]
INT--HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[Hammond is discussing the situation with Fraiser and Anise.]
HAMMOND
The armbands are going to come off on their own?
ANISE
The last bits of data transmitted from their biosensors before they
stepped through the Stargate indicated traces of an antibody.
[Hammond looks at Fraiser.]
FRAISER
To the virus that allowed the devices to enhance their speed and
strength.
ANISE
I'm afraid that we've solved the mystery of the Atoneeks'
extinction.
HAMMOND
How so?
FRAISER
The armbands only work for a limited time, sir!
ANISE
Once the immunity spread among the Atoneek warriors, the armbands
would be useless. I guess they never solved the problem.
HAMMOND
Which means SG-1 is likely out there on a planet full of heavily
armed Jaffa with an advantage that is likely to disappear at any
time!
FRAISER
Yes, sir.
[Anise blinks and the host takes control.]
FREYA
General, for what it's worth, Anise and I are sorry. We were not
aware of the mission prior to our arrival here!
[Anise takes control]
ANISE
I do hope SG-1 return safely.
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[Two armed Jaffa walk around the corner. They see O'Neill and Carter
crouched around an unconscious Daniel and aim their staff weapons at
them.]
JAFFA
Halt kree!
[Carter and O'Neill stand up, raising their arms.]
O'NEILL
All right, you got us! Don't kree!
[The first Jaffa takes aim but is shot by a zat gun and falls to the
floor. The second Jaffa manages to take a shot but O'Neill and Carter
are too fast and are able to dodge it. The second Jaffa is then shot
with a zat and Teal'c emerges from around the corner.]
TEAL'C
It seems my assistance is required after all.
O'NEILL
Yes, thank you.
[Carter goes to help Daniel up. He is groggily coming around.]
DANIEL
What happened?
CARTER
You passed out. Your armband came off!
[Teal'c pulls Daniel to his feet and supports him. O'Neill surveys the
corridors and sees a patrol of Jaffa approaching.]
O'NEILL
All right, talk later, we got to move. Teal'c, get Daniel out of
here, back through the Gate. Carter, with me.
[Teal'c helps Daniel towards the exit. O'Neill and Carter are heard
dealing with the Jaffa.]
INT--POWER CORE
[An alarm sounds. The timer on the C4 shows 2 minutes 46 seconds
remaining until detonation.]
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill and Carter are running towards the shields. O'Neill makes it
through, but Carter is thrown back from it and collapses.]
O'NEILL
Carter?
[Carter's armband falls off and she passes out. O'Neill runs towards
her but is unable to make it through the force shield.] [His armband
falls off and he too collapses and passes out.]
INT--ENTRANCE TO THE BATTLESHIP
[Teal'c is supporting Daniel as they make their way to the exit. Daniel
looks around.]
DANIEL
Where are they?
TEAL'C
They should have been right behind us...continue on, Daniel Jackson.
[He walks back but is stopped by a force shield.]
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[Carter slowly regains consciousness. She sees O'Neill unconscious
opposite her.]
CARTER
Sir?
[Carter notices that her armband has fallen off and throws it to one
side.]
CARTER
COLONEL!
[O'Neill wakes up and notices his fallen armband.]
O'NEILL
We should have brought more snacks!
[Carter checks her watch.]
CARTER
I don't think that would have helped.
[O'Neill checks his watch also.]
O'NEILL
1:56!
[He walks up to the force shield and starts hitting it in an attempt to
get through it.]
CARTER
Sir, you've got to get out of here!
O'NEILL
So do you.
[He goes to a panel in the wall.]
INT--BATTLESHIP ENTRANCE
[Daniel and Teal'c are standing by the entrance unable to get back into
the ship.]
TEAL'C
I am not leaving, Daniel Jackson.
DANIEL
Well, I'm not suggesting we should, but there is no way in there to
help them.
TEAL'C
No.
[Daniel checks his watch.]
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill is hammering at the panel to get access to turn the force
shield off as Carter watches, unable to help.]
INT--BATTLESHIP ENTRANCE
DANIEL
Ten minutes after that C4 goes this whole mountain is going to
explode.
TEAL'C
I am aware of that.
DANIEL
So the fact that we're staying is based upon a completely informed
decision.
TEAL'C
It is.
DANIEL
Yeah...just making sure!
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[O'Neill gets the panel open.]
CARTER
Sir, sir there's no time!
[The sound of Jaffa approaching is heard.]
INT--BATTLESHIP ENTRANCE
[A siren sounds throughout the ship.]
DANIEL
Here goes!
INT--BATTLESHIP CORRIDOR
[Two Jaffa approach Carter and O'Neill. They take aim but as they do so
the C4 goes off. The whole ship rocks and they are all thrown to the
floor. The force shield is knocked off.]
CARTER
Did you see that?
O'NEILL
Let's go!
[They stand and Carter attempts to take the Naquadah with them.]
O'NEILL
Forget that, leave it!
[They run for the exit of the ship.]
INT--BATTLESHIP ENTRANCE
[Daniel and Teal'c get to their feet, having been thrown to the
ground.]
TEAL'C
The shield is down.
[They run back into the ship to find O'Neill and Carter, but they are
already near the entrance.]
O'NEILL
Come on, let's go! Move, move, move! I thought I told you guys to
get back to that Gate!
DANIEL
(sarcastically)
Yeah, Teal'c wouldn't leave!
[They all run out of the entrance.]
EXT--FOREST NEAR THE STARGATE
[They are running to the Stargate. Carter checks her watch.]
CARTER
Less than a minute!
[Staff weapon shots are fired by Jaffa and Teal'c draws his Zat gun.]
TEAL'C
(to SG-1)
Get down!
[The rest of SG-1 crouch beside a fallen tree as Teal'c shoots the
Jaffa. They then continue on tiredly to the Gate.]
EXT--STARGATE
[Teal'c approaches the DHD and shoots a Jaffa who has regained
consciousness. He dials Earth's address. Carter, Daniel and O'Neill
wait exhaustedly behind some stone pillars for Teal'c to send their
IDC. Suddenly the battleship explodes as Teal'c goes to help the rest
of SG-1. The wave of destruction approaches the Gate as they run for
the open wormhole, just making it through in time.]
INT--SGC
[Hammond, Anise and some guards are hurrying down a corridor as an
offworld activation alarm sounds. The Gate is heard opening as they
enter the Gate room. SG-1 tumble through the Gate onto the embarkation
ramp and Hammond runs up to them.]
O'NEILL
(to Hammond)
Just remember, I retired, you wanted me back.
[SG-1 climb to their feet. O'Neill, Carter and Daniel are exhausted.]
HAMMOND
Colonel, are you all ok?
DANIEL
Think so!
CARTER
Will be.
TEAL'C
I am very well, General Hammond.
HAMMOND
What happened?
O'NEILL
(angrily)
The damn armbands fell off, that's what happened!
ANISE
I am sorry.
HAMMOND
Were you successful in destroying the ship?
TEAL'C
Indeed we were, General Hammond.
HAMMOND
Good...report to the infirmary.
O'NEILL
General, sir...about the obviously impending court martial, sir...
HAMMOND
You were all under the influence of an alien technology, Colonel.
That's a pretty solid defense.
O'NEILL
Even so...I'm sorry.
CARTER
Me too.
DANIEL
Me three.
[They all look to Teal'c for his reply.]
TEAL'C
(smugly)
I have no need to apologize.
[He walks down the ramp leaving the others to stare at him.]
HAMMOND
Teal'c was actually following orders.
[He walks off.]
O'NEILL
Of course he was.
[O'Neill, Carter and Daniel walk down the ramp.]
ANISE
You left the armbands behind?
CARTER
We had other things on our minds.
ANISE
Understandable...Colonel?
[Anise's host takes over.]
FREYA
Anise and I both hope we can work together again in the future.
O'NEILL
Both of you?
[She nods at him.]
O'NEILL
Can't wait for that!
[He walks off, leaving Anise alone on the embarkation ramp.]
FADE OUT
