These stones are actually an Ancient form of communication device
that links the users psychically, allowing them to see through each
other's eyes.

themselves in the bodies of Harrid and Sallis.]

Doesn't that look an awful lot like...?
MITCHELL
Yeah, it does.
DANIEL
It can't be, because I was going to say "Stargate".
CARTER
Try "Supergate".

DANIEL
What are you doing?

Trying to help, Daniel. Someone had to do something, and you
wouldn't listen.

DANIEL
Merlin was conducting research on some kind of new invention... A
weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.
CARTER

I don't need to know Ancient to understand what that is.
DANIEL
A Gate address to where he hid the weapon.

TEASER
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[Vala exits an elevator and walks through the corridor. She is dressed
in green BDU's with a black tee-shirt. She is clearly pregnant. She
nods to those passing her, and they don't seem to take special notice
of her. She nods at Siler as he passes.]
SILER
Morning.
VALA
Have you seen Colonel Mitchell?
[Siler stops and turns to her.]
SILER
Men's locker.
[Vala smiles and walks away.]
INT--MEN'S LOCKER, SGC
[Vala slowly enters the locker room. There are many men there in
various stages of undress, chatting with each other.]
MAN
Morning.
VALA
(mouthing silently)
Hi.
[Vala makes a barking sound as one of the men passes by. She saunters
suggestively. She sees Mitchell, his back to her, dressed only in a
towel tied around his waist. He is shaving in the large mirror, which
is covered in steam. She whistles at him. Hearing her, he wipes off a
portion of the steam so that he can see behind him. The body of Daniel
is revealed in the reflection; he is smiling and moving his head in a
feminine, flirtatious manner. Mitchell turns to face him.]
MITCHELL
Jackson? Is there something I should know?
[Vala/Daniel smiles, shrugs her shoulders and tilts her head.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC CAFETERIA
[Carter is eating breakfast but is interrupted by Mitchell and Daniel.
Daniel does not look himself. He has his hands on his hips and is
tilting his head.]
MITCHELL
How is this possible?
CARTER
(smiling around the food in her mouth)
Oh my God. It worked! I mean, you know, it's working.
[She gets up and heads out as the Mitchell and Vala look on.]
INT--CARTER'S LAB
[The three enter her lab. Daniel now looks like Vala.]
CARTER
We didn't think we were ever going to make this work.
MITCHELL
Make what work?
CARTER
Well since you disintegrated the Alteran communication stones and
the base terminal in the kawoosh--
MITCHELL
I'm sorry, the what?
CARTER
The unstable vortex of a forming wormhole. Kawoosh.
MITCHELL
Don't think I've ever heard you call it that before.
CARTER
Really?
MITCHELL
Don't get me wrong, it's good.
CARTER
No, I mean, I'm sure--
VALA
(breaking in, emphatic)
Hello. Hi. My name is Vala, but I'm in Daniel Jackson right now.
CARTER
Anyway, we've been working on a way of artificially emulating the
Alteran technology. Doctor Lee was able to collect quite a bit of
data from the time that you were unconscious and communicating with
the people from the Ori galaxy.
VALA
(nodding)
Hmm.
CARTER
So, using that and this Tok'ra subspace communicator, we've been
trying to mimic the frequencies sent and received by the stones. We
just didn't think we were having any luck.
VALA
I'm really glad you are. I was desperately hoping in fact--
MITCHELL
So you're in the Ori galaxy.
VALA
Yes.
CARTER
Are you able to communicate with Daniel?
VALA
No. Just see and hear you.
CARTER
You see, we've been using the data from the stone that Daniel
connected on this end, which is why you're connected to his body.
VALA
(chuckling)
It's funny, isn't it. Daniel always wanted to get in my pants, and
now I'm in his.
MITCHELL
Oh, that's not funny.
VALA
Hmm?
MITCHELL
He can't defend himself.
CARTER
Okay, you, Vala, were the only other person on this end to touch a
stone, so...
VALA
Oh, I get it, I can't exactly connect to myself if I'm not here. So
the thing is--
MITCHELL
You know, last time we couldn't break the connection.
[Vala is frustrated by his interruptions.]
CARTER
Well that should be easy this time. We just shut down the computer.
VALA
No! I mean, not yet. I didn't just drop in to say 'hello'. I have
something very important to tell you.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
[Vala/Daniel is sitting at a table with a glass of water. On a video
screen is the image of Daniel, who moves and talks exactly in synch
with Vala, since it is really his body the others see. The rest of SG-1
and Landry are listening to her.]
VALA AND DANIEL IN UNISON
I remember staggering into the rings. There were bolts of energy
everywhere.
CARTER
We suspected that the matter stream was sucked into the black hole.
LANDRY
We all appreciate the part you played in destroying the enemy
beachhead.
VALA
(picking up the glass of water)
Don't mention it. By "part", I assume you mean 'lead role'?
LANDRY
(laughing)
We're happy to hear that you're okay.
VALA
Actually, for the record, I never said I was okay.
LANDRY
Actually, the timing of this is a little awkward.
CARTER
Sir, if we disconnect now, there's no guarantee that we can
reestablish the link.
LANDRY
(looking at his watch)
Doctor Jackson is supposed to join me to meet with the Russian and
Chinese representatives of the IOA in about a half an hour. They
requested that he be there. Said it was a matter of great
importance.
VALA
Not as important as what I have to tell you, believe me. I'll try
and be as quick as I can, and then you can have Daniel back. I
promise.
[Landry nods.]
VALA
Uh, so the next thing I remember was waking up in a bed, in a
village like Ver Ager. That's the one that Harrid and Sallis lived
in. They're the people that Daniel and I inhabited for a while.
EXT--VILLAGE OF VER ISCA
[There is an old-world village very similar to Ver Ager, with people
going about their daily lives on the earthen streets.]
VALA
(voiceover)
Anyway, it turns out this village was called Ver Isca.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
[She drinks and gulps loudly from her glass of water.]
VALA
Uh, you know, this water is lovely, but I think Daniel skipped
breakfast, and I suddenly have a craving for pancakes and ice cream.
Double chocolate fudge brownie, if memory serves?
[Carter, Teal'c, and Mitchell look bemused by her request. Landry tilts
his head at her.]
VALA
(to Landry)
Oh, I'll continue while you rustle that up.
[Landry looks taken aback.]
VALA
Thanks. So, where was I?
MITCHELL
In bed.
VALA
Ah yes, in bed. A man named Tomin...
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM, VER ISCA
[Vala is sitting up in Tomin's bed, which has woven blankets and is
surrounded by tapestries on the walls. As Vala speaks in voice-over,
Tomin enters carrying a tray of food and drink.]
VALA
(voiceover)
had apparently found me lying unconscious in the rings and had
thought the gods had sent me to him. Which I let him continue to
believe.
VALA
(in bedroom)
Hi.
[He sets the tray on the bed and then sits beside her.]
TOMIN
Do you feel strong enough to get up and go for a walk today?
VALA
Maybe.
[He reaches up and moves her hair out of her face.]
TOMIN
(getting up)
I'll be back after prostration.
VALA
Have fun.
[He turns back from the doorway, smiling.]
TOMIN
Thank you.
[She reaches for the tray as he watches her.]
VALA
(voiceover)
It was obvious he was smitten.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA AND DANIEL IN UNISON
(licking the empty plate)
Who could blame him, right?
[Vala sets down the empty plate. She has a large glob of chocolate at
the end of her nose. Carter gestures to her own nose.]
VALA
What?
[Carter brushes her finger over her nose. Vala takes the hint and wipes
the tip of her nose with her hand, then licks her hand. Carter nods but
is vaguely disturbed.]
VALA
Thanks. I do realize he was a devout Ori follower and probably would
have been standing on the front line cheering while they burnt me to
death if he knew the truth about me, but he was very sweet in his
own way. And not bad looking, actually.
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM, VER ISCA
[Tomin leaves the room while Vala eats. Some time later, she goes to
the bedroom window and looks down upon the village.]
VALA
(voiceover)
I think Tomin had been on his own before I came along mostly due to
a limp that had left him crippled since childhood. He didn't like to
talk about it much, but I could see that the other villagers looked
down on him because of it.
[As she speaks, she watches Tomin walk down the street limping. The
other villagers don't pay him much attention as they encounter him, and
he must step out of their way.]
VALA
(voiceover)
In their minds, the Ori must have deemed him unfit for normalcy, so
that's how they chose to see him.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
I did my best to blend in. At first, according to Tomin and
therefore as far as the villagers were concerned, I was the woman
who fell from the sky. Which made me feel kind of special. I later
learned that they always suspected I'd escaped from another village
as a result of some scandal, and then I started to feel much more
like I'm used to.
EXT--VILLAGE SQARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[A Prior lights a torch with his staff. All around him, villagers are
on their knees, bent over in prostration. Vala is among the villagers,
next to Tomin.]
VALA
(voiceover)
What worried me most were the Ori. While no one had actually seen me
or Daniel in person, that didn't mean that Ascended Beings couldn't
recognize me... After a while, I started to think and hope that
maybe things were going to be okay.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
Ultimately my goal was to try and find a way back here, or at the
very least try and communicate with you, to let you know what was
going on.
INT--PUB IN VER ISCA
[The bartender, Seevis, serves his customers in a busy and poorly lit
pub. Vala sits near a window while Tomin gets food and drink from the
bar. Live medieval music plays.]
VALA
(voiceover)
So, I figured my best bet was to root out any of Fannis's gang from
the anti-Ori underground. See if they had any technology or any
information about an Ori Stargate I might possibly get access to.
[As she talks, Tomin joins her at the table. She smiles with him.]
VALA
(voiceover)
But I had to be very careful. The village was run by this complete
bear of a man named Seevis, who was both barkeep and administrator.
Which seemed the oddest contradiction! He claimed to be the most
pious man in the village. If anyone strayed from the path of
righteousness, it was Seevis who made sure you were severely
punished for it.
[Seevis approaches and passes a bar maid dressed in a low-cut dress and
speaking to a male patron.]
VALA
(voiceover)
But, there seems to be a lot more leeway for sin in the religion of
Origin than one would presume from all the preaching.
[The barmaid heads toward the back of the bar. Several men clank their
steins together in toast.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
MITCHELL
So it's just like my Grandma used to say: 'No point going to
confession if you ain't got nothin' to confess.'
VALA
(pointing a finger at him)
Exactly.
EXT--ALLEYWAY IN VILLAGE OF VER ISCA, DAY
[Seevis and two of his cohorts have a fourth man pushed up against a
post. It is the patron who was chatting with the bar maid and toasting
his mates earlier, Halstrom.]
SEEVIS
(grabbing the man by his shirt)
By the gods, I do not know what the Ori blessed you with, because it
was not brains, and it was not looks. What makes you think that
something like her would have anything to do with a rodent like you
without good reason, huh?
HALSTROM
I'll pay, I swear.
SEEVIS
Oh, I know you will. Or I'll make you wish you were being burned
alive by the fires of Celestis. Huh?
[Halstrom nods his understanding. Seevis releases him, and goes running
back toward the square. He passes Vala, who has been listening in.]
SEEVIS
(to his lackey, disgusted)
I have picked things more precious out from between my toes.
[With a grunt, he leads his cohorts into the alley, away from the
square. Vala eats an apple from the basket she is holding.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
I soon realized it wasn't a contraction at all. Seevis was doing the
work of the gods by making sure this village had every reason in the
world to prostrate. Making him a very rich and very powerful man in
the process.
LANDRY
Believe me, I usually applaud the colorful details of a good story,
especially when told with such interesting intergalactic and
body-snatching means. But Daniel and I are late to meet with the
Russian and Chinese representatives.
TEAL'C
You stated you had information of great importance.
VALA
I do, I do, and I'm getting to it.
MITCHELL
We got the backstory: Tomin is a nice guy, Seevis is a butt-head.
How about you skip ahead a little?
VALA
Fine.
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[Both dressed in white, Tomin and Vala stand before a Prior, surrounded
by villagers. Vala is holding a bouquet of flowers.]
VALA
(voiceover)
Tomin and I got married.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
CARTER
Whoa, married?
VALA
Stay with me. I had no choice. I told you, he was very devout, and
there's no way he would have slept with me out of wedlock.
[Carter, Teal'c and Mitchell exchange amazed, amused looks.]
MITCHELL
Okay, maybe we skipped ahead a little too far.
VALA
Well I tried to lay it out in order. Ooh, that's a bad choice of
words.
CARTER
Okay, why exactly did you have no choice?
VALA
You know what these people do to you when you do something wrong:
they burn you alive!
MITCHELL
And why would they burn you alive this time?
VALA AND DANIEL IN UNISON
(Daniel on video screen)
For getting pregnant out of wedlock!
[Everyone is shocked.]
MITCHELL
You're pregnant?
VALA
Yes!
VALA AND DANIEL IN UNISON
(Daniel on video screen)
I keep forgetting you can't actually see me.
VALA
When I realized why I was feeling sick all the time, I figured I had
to do something. I decided my only choice was to marry Tomin as
quickly as possible and pray the timing was close enough so he could
be convinced the baby was his.
MITCHELL
All right, hold the phone. And I ask this not one hundred percent
sure that I want to know the answer. Whose baby is it?
VALA
That's the thing. I don't know.
CARTER
(cringing)
As in...
VALA
I swear, I did none of the necessary bits.
(gesturing with her hands to show the timeline)
Between my arrival in the Ori galaxy and my wedding night, which was
definitely after I knew for sure, there is no way humanly possible,
that I know of, that I could have gotten pregnant.
[Landry and the rest of SG-1 look at her and each other as if they
don't know what to believe.]
VALA
Someone going to say something?
VALA AND DANIEL IN UNISON
(Daniel on video screen)
Anybody?
TEAL'C
You have been impregnated without copulation.
VALA
Yes, and I'm absolutely terrified. Have any of you ever heard of
anything like it?
MITCHELL
(after everyone pauses)
Well, there's one.
TEAL'C
Darth Vader.
VALA
Really?
TEAL'C
Hmm.
VALA
How did that turn out?
MITCHELL
Actually, I was thinking of King Arthur.
CARTER
(shocked)
You were?
MITCHELL
Yeah, I've been reading everything I could find on our Ancient
friend Merlin. According to some of the legends, he enchanted the
queen who bore Arthur.
LANDRY
I have to go.
[He starts to walk out.]
VALA
Wait. I haven't even gotten to the bit you have to hear yet.
[Landry stops near the door.]
VALA
Me carrying this child right now is a problem, a big problem for me,
but believe me, there is one which is much, much bigger.
[Landry stands waiting to hear.]
INT--TOMIN'S HOUSE, VER ISCA
[Vala is pounding on a flour mixture with two wooden spoons. She stops
when she sees that Tomin has just entered. He looks anxious.]
TOMIN
It's a miracle. Look at me.
[He looks down at his legs then walks toward Vala. He is no longer
limping at all. Vala drops her spoons in amazement and smiles at him.]
TOMIN
The Prior blessed me. I can walk. I can run. I can fight now.
[Vala stops smiling.]
VALA
You can what?
TOMIN
(hugging her)
I've been conscripted.
[He embraces her happily, but she is very concerned.]
VALA
(voiceover)
They are building ships and armies by the tens of thousands.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
The village I am living in is one of many, on a world among dozens
like it.
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM
[Tomin is dressed in leather and metal armor, admiring himself in his
mirror as Vala looks on from the doorway.]
VALA
(voiceover)
As we feared since the day Daniel met the Ori, they have been
preparing their followers for a crusade.
VALA
(in Tomin's room)
Are you sure this is what you want?
TOMIN
Are you serious? I never dreamed I would one day be fit to serve the
Ori in this way.
[She approaches him as he continues to look into the mirror.]
VALA
By killing people you know nothing about?
TOMIN
All I need to know is that they are enemy of the Ori. That they
reject the teachings of Origin and would have us stray from the
Path.
VALA
But these so-called unbelievers, they're so far away, how can they
affect us? Why do you have to go all the way over there--
TOMIN
(growing angry)
The evil must not not be allowed to fester anywhere!
[Vala sighs in resignation.]
TOMIN
Our journey towards enlightenment may take us to many unexpected
places.
[She turns him to face her and puts her hands on his shoulders.]
VALA
(gently)
I cannot imagine you killing anyone.
TOMIN
I'm not afraid to heed the will of the gods.
VALA
Nothing I say will change your mind, will it?
TOMIN
Fear not. Once we warriors of Ori have vanquished the wicked, I
shall return.
[He kisses her on the cheek then takes another look at himself in the
mirror. She stands behind him, speaking over his shoulder.]
VALA
You will not be the same.
TOMIN
(smiling)
No.
VALA
(voiceover)
He is one of the gentlest, most honest souls I have ever known.
[Vala leaves Tomin's side. As Tomin looks into the mirror, his
expression changes from gentleness to fierceness.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
(crying)
He has been raised since birth to believe in the Ori. To follow
Origin. This isn't a fight anyone can win. Not without a tragic
amount of bloodshed.
[The others are moved by her words and emotion.]
HARRIMAN
(over loudspeaker)
General Landry to the briefing room. General Landry, please report
to the briefing room.
LANDRY
I'd better get down there. Go ahead.
[Landry leaves.]
CARTER
Since you've been gone, we've learned a few things about the Ori
that their followers might be interested to know.
VALA
It doesn't matter what the truth is about the Ori. The people won't
hear it, no matter what you say.
MITCHELL
Obviously, some of them are suspicious enough to form a resistance.
VALA
You're talking about a handful of people compared to millions who
wouldn't know the truth if it were standing right in front of them.
It's all lies and propaganda as far as they're concerned. We're
wrong, they're right. They're good, we're bad. We must worship the
Ori or die, and they will fight until we are dead or they are.
Period.
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Landry enters to find Colonel Chekov and Doctor Shen waiting for him.]
LANDRY
I'm very sorry to keep you waiting.
SHEN
Where is Doctor Jackson?
LANDRY
He's, uh, otherwise occupied at the moment. We're going to have to
proceed without him.
[He takes the seat at the head of the table. Chekov sits to his left.]
CHEKOV
It is no matter. I only asked he be here as a courtesy, seeing as he
negotiated the original treaty between our two countries, resulting
in Russia loaning you a Stargate.
LANDRY
Yes, loaning, in return for full participation in this program and
considerable sums of money.
[Shen smiles and chuckles.]
CHEKOV
I am aware of that. As I said, I only asked for this meeting out of
courtesy to you and Doctor Jackson. You have been admirable comrades
in our cooperative efforts. However, official notification has been
given to your President as we speak.
LANDRY
Of what?
CHEKOV
Well, as you know, the treaty renewal comes up in two weeks. Russia
will no longer be participating under the current structure.
LANDRY
What are you saying?
CHEKOV
I'm saying... we are taking our Stargate back.
[Landry sits back, surprised. He looks at Shen, but she only gazes back
rather blankly.]
INT--PUB IN VER ISCA
[Vala and the barmaid, Denya, sit at a table talking. There are not
many patrons in the pub.]
VALA
(voiceover)
So, this girl in the bar. Her name was Denya, and we struck up a bit
of a friendship.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
By the looks on your faces, I can see you're not surprised I had
more in common with the village harlot than I did with any of the
ladies from the local knitting circle.
MITCHELL
Don't know what you're talking about.
VALA
(smiling)
At least she was honest.
INT--PUB IN VER ISCA
DENYA
I was pregnant once.
VALA
Really?
DENYA
It didn't last long.
VALA
Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, I heard something really weird.
DENYA
I promise you, I've heard it all.
VALA
Well, have you ever heard of someone getting pregnant without
actually doing the deed?
DENYA
How could that happen?
VALA
(with false casualness)
I don't know.
DENYA
Maybe you fell asleep, you know? That's happened to me before. I've
been drunk and not remembered whole days.
VALA
(laughing)
I wasn't talking about me.
DENYA
Oh?
VALA
No, I was just wondering, have you ever heard of the Ori giving
someone a baby magically? They perform miracles all the time, right?
DENYA
(rather coldly)
If you say so.
VALA
(voiceover)
She's smart, too. She was testing me.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
CARTER
Are you saying she was part of the anti-Ori underground?
VALA
Took a long time to get her to admit it. She said she was afraid of
Seevis and that he'd kill her if he found out.
EXT--DOOR TO TOMIN'S HOME, DAY
[Vala opens the door and sees Seevis there with other men.]
VALA
What do you want?
[Seevis pushes the door open and grabs her by the hair, then pulls her
out of the house.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[Some of Seevis' men chain Vala sitting to a bench in the middle of a
circular dais of the type she was burned on in Ver Ager.]
VALA
(struggling futilely)
Take your hands off me!
[Villagers begin to gather around. Seevis walks around the outside of
the structure.]
VALA
So what did I do?
SEEVIS
She is unholy! She conspires with those who would lead us from the
Path of Origin.
VALA
I don't know who you've been talking to, but it's a lie.
SEEVIS
She is an unbeliever, and she must be punished for her sins.
[Denya is standing with the crowd behind Seevis; she looks very
frightened.]
INT--LANDRY'S OFFICE
[Landry enters walking briskly, clearly agitated. Chekov follows.
Landry activates the intercom on his phone.]
LANDRY
Get me Richard Woolsey now!
CHEKOV
General--
LANDRY
Where are the rest of the International Committee representatives?
Why aren't they here?
CHEKOV
This has nothing to do with them.
LANDRY
I think it does.
CHEKOV
The Stargate belongs to Russia! Now, in the past, my government has
been unwilling to establish and support a Stargate Program of its
own, but that has changed.
LANDRY
Because China is backing you. Do the rest of the Committee members
know this?
CHEKOV
They will be invited to participate in the Program the same as they
have in yours. As will your country.
LANDRY
(incredulous)
You really think my government will give up the gate?
CHEKOV
(huffing a breath)
I do not see what choice they will have.
[Chekov walks out; Landry sighs heavily.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[Vala sits on the bench, her hands chained loosely to the ground. She
stares straight ahead as Seevis and male villagers stand around her
menacingly. Seevis grabs her hair and tilts her head back toward him.]
SEEVIS
Who else in the village has been corrupted?
VALA
Apart from you, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[He releases her hair.]
SEEVIS
(loudly, to villagers)
No one shall look upon, speak to, or aid such evil!
(to Vala)
You will tell me who you've conspired with, (loudly, for all to
hear)
and the unbelievers will be found out and punished for their sins.
Hallowed are the Ori.
[Seevis leaves as do other villagers. Vala turns around to see Tomin
looking at her. She starts to say something, but he walks away and up
the nearby stairs to their home, abandoning her.]
VALA
(voiceover)
I don't know why I expected me to come rushing over and unchain me.
I'm just the mother of his unborn child. Or so he was supposed to
think.
[Vala turns away from looking for Tomin.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[Sometime later, Vala stretches uncomfortably. Villagers walk by,
looking but not moving to help.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, NIGHT
[Vala sits alone where she is chained.]
INT--TOMIN'S HOME, DAY
[Tomin sits on the floor at the foot of his bed, sadly contemplating.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[The sun beats down upon Vala. Sometime later, a man takes a drink from
a nearby barrel of water. She looks on longingly. Day passes to dusk
and then night. Finally Vala loses consciousness, falling off of the
bench and onto the ground.]
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM (DREAM)
[Vala lies on the bed along. The canopy above her is completely
engulfed in flames. A skeletal face forms in the flames, looking
directly at her. She is frightened but doesn't move. The face begins to
descend toward her.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[Vala wakes with a start. Her lips are very chapped and she looks
exhausted. She manages to pull herself back to the bench and leans on
it with her arms. She sees Tomin and their eyes meet, but once again he
turns his back and walks away. Sad and frustrated, she turns and sits
on the ground, her back against the bench.]
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, EVENING
[Vala is too weak to lift her arms from the bench. From the pub window,
Denya looks on.]
INT--PUB, VER ISCA
[Seevis pours a shot of liquor and downs it all at once as Denya
approaches him rapidly.]
DENYA
(upset)
She's dying out there.
SEEVIS
I know.
DENYA
Don't you think if she was going to say anything...
[He gets up and walks away quickly, disturbed.]
DENYA
(yelling after him)
...she would have told you already!
EXT--VILLAGE SQUARE, VER ISCA, DAY
[Tomin unchains an unconscious Vala. He lifts her head to look at her
face and kisses her forehead. Seevis comes out from the pub and looks
on. Tomin lifts Vala into his arms. He makes eye contact with two of
Seevis's men, then walks away. Seevis looks angry, but walks back into
the pub.]
VALA
(voiceover)
I didn't know why he eventually did it... or why Seevis let us go.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
I was left out there, without food or water, for three days.
CARTER
I can't believe the baby survived that.
VALA
(after a pause)
Part of me was hoping it didn't.
MITCHELL
It's kind of surprising part of you was hoping it did... I mean,
given 'the how' it was conceived.
VALA
It's hard to explain.
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM, NIGHT
[Vala and Tomin lie side by side. Tomin rests his had on her belly, and
she rests her hand on his.]
VALA
(scared)
Seevis.
TOMIN
He won't bother us again, I promise you.
VALA
You don't think I'm evil?
TOMIN
I'm sorry I left you out there for so long... Please forgive me.
[Vala swallows but doesn't respond.]
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM, MORNING
[Tomin packs his armor into his canvas sack. He starts to leave, and
Vala turns over in bed to watch him. He comes back to the bed and leans
over her.]
TOMIN
I will see you this evening. Fear not.
[He smiles and kisses her quickly, then leaves. Vala goes to the window
and watches him join other men going off to training. She sees Seevis
walking around outside as well.]
VALA
(voiceover)
Despite Tomin's reassurances, the idea of spending the day in the
village with Seevis just a stone's throw away made me nervous.
Besides, it was high time I did some more extensive recon.
EXT--COUNTRYSIDE OUTSIDE VER ISCA, DAY
[Vala walks along a path through the woods. Hearing steps, she gets off
the path and hides behind a large tree. A Prior leads a two-man wide
column of armored men past her hiding place. She follows them and comes
to a cliff.]
VALA
(voiceover)
I knew what was happening. I knew where they were going every day,
what they were doing. But seeing it was something else entirely.
[She looks over the edge of the cliff to see man large space ships on
the sand below. They are under construction, and each has a large
circular propulsion device resting horizontally within it.]
[Seevis comes up behind her.]
SEEVIS
Impressive, isn't it.
[She turns to face him, shocked. She backs as far as she can to the
edge. He smiles menacingly, and she glares back at him.]
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[Landry stands alone at the base of the ramp. Chekov enters.]
CHEKOV
General, you wish to see me.
LANDRY
From the sounds of it, the Ori are planning an invasion of massive
proportions in the very near future. It looks like it might be a
very bad time to be arguing over who gets to use the Stargate,
Colonel. But I assume you were counting on that.
CHEKOV
No sane individual or country wants to face war at any time.
LANDRY
Telling me about your government's intentions was more than mere
courtesy. Doing it with the Chinese representative of the Oversight
Committee present was meant to point out China's involvement. That
wasn't in the official notification to terminate the treaty given to
the President.
CHEKOV
Obviously it couldn't be.
LANDRY
They offered you a deal to back your own SGC Program. In truth, you
don't really know if you like that scenario any better than the one
currently in practice. You did, however, see an opportunity to use
it as leverage.
[Chekov looks away, not denying Landry's claims.]
LANDRY
But you couldn't very well present a wish list along with the
official notification without it looking like blackmail, or have it
on record that you were merely using the Chinese. So, you left it to
me to figure out and ask you the question: What is it you really
want?
[Chekov smiles sheepishly.]
EXT--CLIFF OVERLOOKING ORI SHIPS, DAY
[Standing with her back to the edge of the cliff, Vala pulls out a
small knife and points it at Seevis.]
VALA
Stay back.
[Denya walks out from the cover of the woods.]
VALA
I promise, you don't want to come any closer.
SEEVIS
You can put that down.
DENYA
It's okay.
[Vala makes a grunt of surprise.]
SEEVIS
We had to put you through that.
DENYA
To be sure that we could trust you.
[Staring them down, Vala slowly lowers the knife.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
MITCHELL
(amazed)
He was part of the underground?
VALA
Seevis is the leader. The religious pomp and circumstance is a
cover. The rest is for money, power, and influence: the things you
need when you're wanting to mount a rebellion.
[Vala smiles in satisfaction. Teal'c approaches her.]
TEAL'C
Do they not fear being discovered by the Ori?
VALA
Of course. But the only other choice is to do nothing.
EXT--CLIFF OVERLOOKING ORI SHIPS, DAY
[Vala, Denya, and Seevis look down upon the Ori ships under
construction.]
VALA
(voiceover)
And what they were planning was quite the opposite of nothing.
SEEVIS
We have the plans, and we have many people down there on the inside.
VALA
(smiling)
You really think it can work?
SEEVIS
(smiling)
It has to.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
The ships had to be activated by the Priors, but Seevis said he'd
found a way to rig enough of them to start off a massive chain
reaction.
EXT--COUNTRYSIDE OUTSIDE VER ISCA, DAY
[They walk through the woods back toward Ver Isca.]
VALA
(voiceover)
From what I could tell, it looked like it might work.
DENYA
Three days from now, in a grand celebration, each Prior will
activate a ship in a show of the Ori's power.
VALA
Everyone will be there?
SEEVIS
All those who built the ships as well as those who will soon board
them and go off and fight in the name of the Ori. Tens of thousands.
VALA
You're going to kill all of them?
SEEVIS
Gods cannot be gods without those who stand beneath them gazing
upwards.
[Vala pauses, concerned.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
They were going to try and undermine the Ori's power by eliminating
as many of their followers as they could in one fell swoop.
Something I'm not sure we would have done in their position.
INT--PUB IN VER ISCA
[Seevis, Denya, and Vala enter the empty pub.]
SEEVIS
Shut the windows.
[They pull all of the curtains closed.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
They trusted me. Granted, they nearly killed me so I could earn
their trust, but at this point I felt I had to take a chance.
INT--PUB IN VER ISCA
[Using an iron tool, Seevis pries up the top of a large wooden table.
Denya helps him set the top on the floor, revealing a large, hollow
base.]
VALA
(voiceover)
I told them exactly who I was and how I'd gotten there.
[Concealed inside the hollow base is an Ancient communication terminal
and two stones.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
VALA
The communication terminal and the stones had been taken by the
Prior to Celestis after Daniel and I had been caught using them.
MITCHELL
How did Seevis get his hands on it?
VALA
Apparently he has spies among the monks in the City of Celestis.
They're humans in training to become Priors. Every now and then,
artifacts which pre-date the Ori ascension are found or dug up,
deemed heretical, and then brought to the city to be burnt in the
fires. When the communication terminal came through, Seevis's men
recognized its significance, and they risked everything to save it
and smuggle it out of the city. So, it appears that Daniel's crazy
little speech about communication from another galaxy did not fall
entirely on deaf ears.
CARTER
And the Ori didn't know? They couldn't tell what was happening right
underneath their noses?
VALA
Can't be sure. But Seevis didn't want me to try and contact you
until after the sabotage plan had gone through.
MITCHELL
In case the Ori detected it.
VALA
Just to be safe.
INT--TOMIN'S HOME
[Tomin enters and sets down his sack of armor.]
TOMIN
Vala?
(calling up the stairs)
Vala?
[A Prior enters behind Tomin, carrying a staff and the Book of Origin.]
PRIOR
Blessed are those follow the Path in unison.
[Tomin turns and bows to the Prior.]
TOMIN
Prior?
PRIOR
Your wife is not at home, Tomin.
TOMIN
She must be at market.
PRIOR
Must she?
TOMIN
To what do I owe the honor of such a visit?
PRIOR
Word of your courage has spread.
TOMIN
If you refer to my unchaining of Vala, I believe Seevis accused her
unjustly. She is not corrupt, or surely the Ori would not have
allowed her to survive so long without food or water. They sent her
to me. She is my wife. The mother of my unborn child.
PRIOR
Is she, now? The injury that crippled you since childhood, the one I
have cured you of, to make you a strong, proud warrior--
[As they speak, Vala makes her way quietly down the stairs, overhearing
them while remaining out of sight.]
TOMIN
Trust I will use the strength I have been given to fight all
unbelievers in the name of the Ori.
[Vala sits quietly on the staircase.]
PRIOR
Yes. But the same wound that made you lame, also made you unable to
father children.
TOMIN
But then wh--
[He stops, realizing the implications. Under the Prior's gaze, he steps
back in shock and turns away.]
TOMIN
(turning back)
Are you saying she betrayed me?
PRIOR
The child is the will of the Ori. That is all that matters. Your
courage will be rewarded, Tomin. Fear not. Hallowed are the children
of the Ori.
TOMIN
Hallowed are the Ori.
INT--TOMIN'S BEDROOM, NIGHT
[Vala and Tomin lie the bed, awake, their backs to each other.]
EXT--VER ISCA VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY
[Soldiers move slowly through the streets, carrying their armor sacks.]
INT--TOMIN'S HOME
[Tomin opens the front door and is about to leave.]
VALA
Don't go.
[He closes the door and stays inside.]
TOMIN
Today is the day we've been waiting for. Ten Priors from Celestis
come to bless the starcraft we've been building these past many
months.
VALA
I know.
TOMIN
Everyone is going. Everyone. Even the women and children. Of course,
I did not expect you... I know you've been tired, but it is going to
be a great day if you want to come.
[Vala reaches her hand toward him.]
VALA
Please. Stay with me today.
[He doesn't move, and she withdraws her hand.]
VALA
I have a bad feeling. I can't explain it. Don't you ever just get
bad feelings?
TOMIN
Of course I do. Then I turn to the Ori for guidance.
VALA
Tomin--
TOMIN
The day of reckoning for all those who were raised by evil is upon
them. I have spent my whole life waiting for the chance to walk the
Path as I do now. My only hope was that you would walk it with me.
[Vala nods but says nothing. Disappointed, Tomin turns away, picks up
his sack, and opens the door.]
TOMIN
Blessed are those who walk in unison.
[He leaves, closing the door behind him.]
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
MITCHELL
When you say 'day of reckoning'...
CARTER
We've heard numerous reports of the Priors in this galaxy warning of
an impending doomsday.
TEAL'C
A day when all who have renounced the Ori will feel their wrath.
VALA
We knew the Priors were just the first wave. The real Crusade is
about to begin. The ships are planning to leave.
CARTER
But that would mean--
VALA
Somewhere out there the Ori have a working Supergate.
EXT--CLIFF OVERLOOKING ORI SHIPS, DAY
VALA
(voiceover)
Turns out the horrible feeling I'd lied to Tomin about was
completely justified, but for a different reason. Thousands of men,
women, and children did not die that day. Seevis's plan failed.
[The Ori starcraft ships activate without incident, the rings in their
centers blazing with white light.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR VER ISCA, DAY
[Vala and the others walk rapidly back toward the village.]
VALA
(voiceover)
It didn't work. The sabotage had broken down. Whether the Ori had
detected it or the Priors had managed to thwart it on their own, we
don't know. All we know is that the ships came to life, and nothing
happened, except the crowd cheered and began prostrating, praying
for a swift victory over all unbelievers.
INT--SGC OBSERVATION ROOM
MITCHELL
Do you have any other intel we could use? You said this Seevis had
access to the specs on the ships. What kind of weaponry do they
have?
CARTER
And shields, and anything on the power source they're using.
VALA AND DANIEL
No, no, I--
[On the video screen and sitting at the table now is only Daniel, and
he appears confused. The others look at him with curiosity.]
DANIEL
Guys, what's going on?
MITCHELL
Jackson?
DANIEL
How did I get here?
CARTER
The emulator's still running. Something must have happened on Vala's
end.
INT--PUB IN VER ISCA
[Vala takes her hands away from the smoking communication terminal that
has just been damaged. Tomin stands at the door, wielding a long
weapon. He shoots Seevis in the chest, and then Denya in the back as
she tries to run. They both die in a few moments.]
VALA
Tomin!
TOMIN
You said you did not think I could kill an unbeliever.
VALA
Well I'm so sorry I was wrong! You have to listen to me.
TOMIN
(shouting)
No! I am deaf to all but the teachings of Origin.
(slightly calmer)
The Prior told me Seevis was corrupt. That he tried to sabotage the
ceremony and would have killed thousands. He sent me here to kill
Seevis, and here I found you with him, conspiring over that device!
VALA
(pointing at Seevis and Denya's bodies)
The made me do it!
(sitting, speaking very emotionally)
They told me they would kill me if I didn't help them, and after
what they did to me out there, wouldn't you? They thought this
device was for communication, but they were too afraid to use it
themselves, so they kidnapped me and forced me to do it for them...
Did the Prior tell you I was with them? Did he tell you to kill me?
TOMIN
No.
VALA
Well, there you go, then.
[She stands and approaches him, pushing the point.]
TOMIN
Were you able to communicate with the unbelievers far away?
VALA
Yes. And there is much I can tell you about them.
(grabbing her belly)
If you just put that weapon down.
[He doesn't move.]
VALA
Tomin, you have to believe me, please... I overheard your
conversation with the Prior the other day. I know, I'm sorry, I
should have told you I was there. But I was so afraid. What he said
shocked me. That this child is the will of the Ori? Tomin, I swear,
I have not betrayed you. I have not been with anyone but you. So if
you truly cannot father a child, then this baby is a miracle. It's
our miracle, and this is a great burden which I cannot bear alone.
So from this point on, we must walk the Path together.
[Moved, Tomin gives in and lowers his weapon.]
TOMIN
I must leave soon for war.
VALA
Then I must come with you.
[He steps over to her, goes to his knees, and puts his forehead against
her belly. She rests her hands on his head and sighs heavily in
relief.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY
INT--SGC ELEVATOR
[Daniel and Landry ride the elevator.]
DANIEL
So, what exactly did we have to give up in the end?
LANDRY
The 304.
DANIEL
Really? I'm surprised the President agreed to that.
[They exit the elevator.]
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
LANDRY
Colonel Chekov's had his eye on one for a while. The latest was
about to roll out.
DANIEL
I thought the next Daedalus class ship wasn't due out of the
pipeline for over a year.
LANDRY
It was a huge concession, but we didn't have much choice.
[The arrive at the Briefing Room.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Carter, Mitchell, and Teal'c are there, near the window overlooking
the gate.]
CARTER
Sir. The Tok'ra and the Asgard are scanning for any subspace
anomalies that would indicate Supergate activity. We're monitoring
the existing black holes that we know of, but it's a big galaxy.
MITCHELL
And, as we know, the Ori could have built another one.
TEAL'C
The Interim Council have placed Ha'tak-class vessels in every region
in high alert.
LANDRY
This is one needle in a haystack we'd better find. Do whatever you
have to do.
MITCHELL
If the Ori can send troops and ships here, we're going to need every
advantage we can find.
CARTER
Merlin was working on a weapon to fight the Ori.
DANIEL
Every ally we have and everyone else on this base has already
devoted themselves to finding the Supergate.
MITCHELL
Sir, it won't take us long to search one planet where there may be
an advanced weapon designed specifically to fight these guys.
LANDRY
This weapon won't help us against their followers.
DANIEL
I don't think so, no, but it'll be a lot easier convincing their
followers their gods are false, if their gods aren't around anymore.
LANDRY
Go.
DANIEL
(nodding)
Thank you, sir.
[SG-1 leaves the briefing room. Landry sighs and turns to look at the
gate.]
