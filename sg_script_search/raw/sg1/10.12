TEASER
INT--SGC GATE ROOM
[The wormhole is open. SG-1, minus Daniel Jackson, strolls down the
ramp. Carter and Vala are smiling. Landry is there to meet them.]
LANDRY
So, how did it go?
MITCHELL
Absolutely incredible, sir. You can forget about the Ori. With an
act like that, Sam will be headlining in Vegas.
CARTER
Okay, stop.
TEAL'C
The performance of the device did exceed all expectations, General
Landry.
MITCHELL
I'm telling you, sir, a few tweaks here and there, we'll be able to
hide anything we want. Troops, ships, planets...
CARTER
It's a lot more complicated than that, sir, but I do think we're
ready for a large-scale test.
LANDRY
Good. Get changed. I may have just the thing.
[Vala nudges Carter with a smile, and Mitchell pats Carter on the
back.]
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Mitchell, Carter, Vala and Teal'c are seated with Reynolds and Landry.
They have blue briefing folders in front of them.]
LANDRY
Colonel Reynolds has been conducting reconnaissance on P9C-882 as
part of the on-going mission to track the Ori advance in the galaxy.
REYNOLDS
Approximately four hours ago, the people of 882 were visited by a
Prior.
MITCHELL
Let me guess: he made them an offer they couldn't refuse.
REYNOLDS
With a slight twist. He told 'em to build this.
[He unrolls a parchment onto the table. On it are architectural
drawings of an Ara, the oval-shaped structure in which Vala was burned.
There is Ancient writing on the parchment as well as the drawing. Vala
makes a small noise and looks away from it.]
LANDRY
(to Vala)
I take it you've seen that before.
VALA
Oh, yes.
(pointing at the drawing, to the path the fire takes)
They use these to burn people alive who don't follow their rules.
REYNOLDS
He gave them three days, at which time he said he'd return to check
their progress.
TEAL'C
What has been the villagers' response?
REYNOLDS
Already rejected the idea. They lived under the Goa'uld for
centuries. They're not about to give up their freedom again. They've
asked for our help.
[Vala gasps in realization.]
VALA
You want to use Sam's device to make them disappear!
CARTER
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second. First of all, it's
Merlin's device. And second, while I agree the modifications I've
made have potential, it's far from ready to deploy in the field on
that scale. I'm sure that that's not what the General is proposing.
LANDRY
Actually Colonel, that is what I'm proposing. The IOA has reviewed
the reports of your experiments, and they think it's time to take
this new technology out of the lab. I happen to agree with them.
CARTER
With respect, sir. You're talking about trying to hide an entire
village... of people.
LANDRY
I realize it's a tall order, Colonel, but we seem to have a
three-day window here. Any chance you can make the necessary
adjustments in that time?
VALA
(enthusiastically)
Can do, sir. Not a problem.
[Carter looks at Vala in amazed annoyance.]
LANDRY
Good!
[Landry stands up and leaves. Carter huffs at Vala in question.]
VALA
What? Don't look at me like that. We've got a village to save!

OPENING CREDITS
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[The village looks similar to others the Ori have conquered, but there
are closed-in patios in front of the houses and communal benches set up
with food on them. The main pathway is crowded with people watching the
SGC personnel arrive, with a FRED piled high with cases of equipment. A
woman, Thilana leads a delegation from the village. Beside her is
Matar.]
THILANA
(to Reynolds)
You have returned! Bless us all.
REYNOLDS
SG-1, this is Thilana, leader of the village. This is Colonel
Mitchell, Teal'c, Vala, and Colonel Carter.
THILANA
(bowing to them)
I cannot express our thanks to you in coming to our aid.
MITCHELL
It's our pleasure.
THILANA
We are at your service. The building we've selected is this way.
Matar?
[Matar steps forward to Vala.]
MATAR
(taking the yellow case she is carrying)
Allow me to carry this.
VALA
(smiling)
Thank you!
[Vala stretches her back.]
VALA
(to Carter)
Don't you just love helping people?
[She walks away from a long-suffering Carter.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Carter is in a building with a large room lined in shelves of books.
She has been unpacking the metal cases of equipment. Her laptop is
already running on a table, and three naquadah generators are sitting
on it as well. Thilana enters.]
THILANA
I hope this location is suitable for you. I can have the rest of
these things removed if you like.
CARTER
Oh no, it's great. Thank you.
THILANA
For years, my ancestors were forced to record the true history of
our people in secret, beyond the eyes of the Goa'uld. This room now
houses their legacy. It seemed appropriate you do your work here.
CARTER
(smiling and nodding)
I'm flattered.
[Carter sets up more equipment, but Thilana lingers.]
THILANA
I must admit, Colonel Carter, some of my people are concerned about
what this machine will do. I would like to be able to reassure them.
CARTER
(stopping her work to explain)
Oh, yeah, of course! Let me walk you through it. Um, basically this
machine shifts all matter within a preset range, in this case the
entire village, into another dimension. So when the Prior returns,
he won't be able to see or hear you. In fact, he'll be able to walk
right through you.
[Thilana looks alarmed.]
CARTER
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt at all. And it is just temporary. Just
long enough to fool the Prior. Once he leaves, we can put everything
back to normal.
[Thilana smiles and nods in acceptance.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Mitchell approaches Vala and Teal'c.]
MITCHELL
Sam's all set.
TEAL'C
Colonel Reynolds and his team are standing by at the gate.
[The villagers gather closely around them.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Reynolds, this is Mitchell.
EXT--CLEARING IN FRONT OF GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Reynolds is at the gate with his team.]
MITCHELL
(via radio)
Remember we're gonna be out of radio contact once we go out of
phase.
REYNOLDS
(into radio)
Understood.
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Mitchell steps up onto a bench to address the gathered villagers.]
MITCHELL
Listen up, folks! We're gonna try a little disappearing act here.
Please remember to keep your arms and legs inside the village at all
times, until we come to a complete and final stop.
[The villagers murmur to each other and look bewildered.]
MITCHELL
Blank stares work, too.
[He steps off the bench.]
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Sam, light her up.
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Carter is sitting in front of her laptop. The three naquadah
generators are connected to each other on the table.]
CARTER
(into radio)
Copy that.
[She checks the plots on the laptop, then activates a program. The
generators light up and emit a whine that grows in pitch and volume.
Carter hits the "Enter" key on the keyboard.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[The village and all the people are enveloped in rays of light, then
disappear.]
EXT--CLEARING IN FRONT OF GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Reynolds and his team see the village disappear in the distance.]
REYNOLDS
(chuckling)
We have the craziest jobs in the world. Dial us out, Lieutenant.
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, NIGHT
[The team is eating at a table with Thilana and Matar. The mood is
celebratory. Young girls give Carter and Vala red flowers.]
CARTER AND VALA
(in unison)
Thank you!
[Thilana stands to address the villagers.]
THILANA
Tonight we honor our newest friends from Earth, whose wisdom,
generosity and kindness have allowed us to resist those who wish to
return us to slavery.
(to the team)
We extend to you our deepest and most sincere thanks.
[She and the other villagers bow to the team. Suddenly the light of the
displacement field flashes. They have moved back to their own
dimension. The villagers call out in concern and fear. The team stands
up, alarmed.]
VALA
(holding Mitchell's arm)
What was that?
CARTER
I think the displacement field collapsed. I'll go check it out.
[They head for the building housing the equipment.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Carter examines the equipment then sits down at the laptop and
examines the data read-outs.]
CARTER
Okay, I've got some good news and some bad news.
MITCHELL
Good first.
CARTER
Well, in order to bring everything back completely, the machine has
to maintain a connection with every single molecule that it sends
out of phase. Now obviously that requires a lot of energy, so I
implemented a failsafe that would automatically bring everything
back into our dimension in the event of a power disruption.
TEAL'C
And such a disruption occurred.
CARTER
Well, it was just a slight fluctuation, but it was enough to trigger
the failsafe.
MITCHELL
So what do we do?
CARTER
Actually, that's the problem. I thought I'd stabilized the power
supply.
MITCHELL
Can you fix it?
[Carter looks around, uncertain.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, NIGHT
[Mitchell, Vala, and Teal'c approach Thilana, who is talking to Matar.]
THILANA
You will not abandon us?
MITCHELL
We're not. But is there a safe place that you can take your people?
A planet, maybe you're familiar with?
THILANA
Won't the Prior find us wherever we go?
MATAR
Then perhaps we should consider heeding the Prior's wishes.
THILANA
(certain, intense)
No! I will not stand by while we are once again subjugated into
serving false gods. We must stand our ground.
TEAL'C
The Prior is very powerful.
THILANA
Then please, you must help us. Don't give up on us yet.
MITCHELL
We're not.
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[It is morning. Carter is on the ground working on a large piece of
equipment. A military cot with a blanket and pillow is behind her.
Mitchell enters carrying a metal cup.]
MITCHELL
Coffee!
CARTER
Oh! Thank you!
MITCHELL
(handing it to her)
Don't get too excited. They packed us decaf by mistake.
CARTER
D'oh!
[She drinks it anyway.]
MITCHELL
Teal'c's gone to the gate to watch for the Prior... Look, I hate to
rush you, Sam, but we gotta make a decision about this. Landry was
pretty clear; we're not to let this thing fall into enemy hands.
CARTER
I know. I've rigged an Ancient capacitor similar to the kind used in
the Stargates between the device and the generators. It should
collect the power and hopefully feed it more evenly.
MITCHELL
Well, that sounds great.
EXT--CLEARING IN FRONT OF GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Teal'c hides behind a tree stump, keeping an eye on the area. He sees
something in the sky and hears the sound of a craft.]
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Colonel Mitchell, do you read?
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Loud and clear, Teal'c. What's up?
EXT--WOODS NEAR GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Our time.
[At least five Ori fighter craft scream by overhead. They pass over the
village, which is visible.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[The fighters speed by, alarming the villagers. Mitchell runs up to
Vala.]
VILLAGER
What is it?
VALA
(referring to Ori ships)
They're checking for the monument.
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Sam, we've got fighters circling. How are you coming with that
disappearing act?
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
CARTER
(into radio)
Just a few more minutes!
[She continues working intensely.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Mitchell instructs Thilana.]
MITCHELL
Get these people inside, now!
(grabbing Matar)
Not you!
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Teal'c, buddy? Looks like we could use you back here now.
EXT--WOODS NEAR GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Teal'c is already running back toward the village.]
TEAL'C
(into radio)
I am on my way.
[Teal'c hears the fighters approaching and stops to look. One comes to
a hover above the clearing and drops a large platform onto the ground.
It is a form of ring transporter. It activates, and a group of Ori
soldiers materializes.]
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Colonel Mitchell. An Ori fighter has deposited a ring platform
outside the village. There are ground forces headed your way.
[As he speaks, the Ori soldiers move out.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
MITCHELL
(to Matar)
All right, this way.
[He jogs off with Matar, passing other villagers.]
MITCHELL
(to other villagers)
Come with me!
(he leads them all to the FRED)
Have you ever fired a gun before?
MATAR
No.
[Mitchell opens a black case filled with P-90's. He takes one out.]
MITCHELL
All right, blank stares aren't gonna cut it this time.
(demonstrating with the P-90)
Listen up! Pull this. Aim there. Squeeze that.
[He gives the gun to Matar, who fires it somewhat wildly for a few
seconds.]
MITCHELL
(showing him)
All right, yeah. Just make sure this end is pointed away from you
and anyone else you don't want to kill. Pass these out to whoever
wants 'em.
[Mitchell rushes away. Matar studies his gun as other villagers grab
more from the two boxes of them.]
EXT--WOODS NEAR GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Teal'c waits for the next group of soldiers to ring in. As soon as
they do, he begins firing at them with his P-90, hitting several
because they are standing so close together. He throws a grenade that
takes out a couple more, then resumes firing. The remaining soldiers
return fire, and after a moment Teal'c stands and retreats. Two
soldiers follow him.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Soldiers pour in through the large wooden doors of the village. The
armed villagers fire on them from behind some of the solid fences in
front of the houses. Vala and Mitchell are firing along with the
villagers. A female shooter is hit by an Ori blast.]
VALA
(to Mitchell)
We can't hold them off forever, you know.
MITCHELL
I know!
[The soldiers signal each other to separate, and they move out in
opposite directions.]
MITCHELL
They're splitting up, trying to flank us.
[Another villager is hit as Mitchell gets up and moves back away from
the front line.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[While Carter works, an Ori soldier sneaks into the library behind her.
She senses him and turns toward him, diving out of the way as he
shoots. She is hit in the left side of her abdomen. Two of the naquadah
generators appear to short out from the blasts. Carter yells in pain on
the floor. Mitchell comes in and shoots the soldier in the back
multiple times. He sees Carter injured.]
MITCHELL
Sam?
[He kneels and tries to help her. She is in pain and fearful.]
MITCHELL
It's okay. You'll be okay.
[She pulls her hand away from her side. It is covered with blood, and
the wound is visible through her tee-shirt. Mitchell looks very
worried. Carter grabs hold on his jacket with her right hand.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Vala and the remaining villagers fire on multiple soldiers, but are
far outnumbered. A soldier comes upon them from behind and shoots a
villager. Vala shoots him back then takes one out from a rooftop. Matar
runs out of bullets. The villagers stop firing, and some put their
hands up in surrender. A soldier points his staff directly at Vala's
head.]
SOLDIER
Stay where you are!
[Two other soldiers aim at her. She lowers her weapon and raises her
hands.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell is with Carter, who is writhing in pain.]
MITCHELL
No, no, ah. You'll be fine. Just stay with me!
[He takes off his cap and throws it to the floor.]
SOLDIER
(from outside)
Search the village!
[Soldiers appear outside the window. They are starting to search the
buildings.]
MITCHELL
All right, we have to move.
CARTER
We can't!
MITCHELL
Sam, we have to!
CARTER
The device...
MITCHELL
All right. Yeah.
[He pulls a block of C-4 from his vest.]
CARTER
No! You can't destroy it!
MITCHELL
Well, what do you want me to do? I can't carry you and all that
junk!
CARTER
Activate it!
[He gets up to go to the device, and she screams in pain.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[The soldiers herd the villagers and Vala to the central square.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell looks at the generators. Two are powered off.]
MITCHELL
It's no good; they're fried!
CARTER
All of them?
MITCHELL
Well, we've got one working!
CARTER
Ah, bypass the other two; connect the leads.
[He does so.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[A soldier turns to look at the library building as if he has heard
something.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
MITCHELL
All right, what's next?!
CARTER
There's a macro on the main control screen.
MITCHELL
(looking at the several windows open on the laptop)
I have no idea where that is!
[He looks to Carter, but she has lost consciousness.]
MITCHELL
Sam? Sam!
[He sees soldiers approaching the library. He starts clicking through
the windows on the laptop and comes to one with writing on it.]
MITCHELL
That's it. I think.
[The soldiers are nearly there.]
MITCHELL
Well, it better be it.
[He hits the enter key and is instantly enveloped by the
dimension-shifting light pattern.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[From the viewpoint of the soldiers, the library building disappears
completely, leaving a grassy square in its place, next to an open
archway into another room full of books. The soldiers walk back to Vala
and the villagers, who are kneeling on the ground.]
ORI FIRSTMAN
(demanding, to Vala)
What just happened? How did that building disappear?
VALA
Perhaps it was the will of the gods.
ORI FIRSTMAN
All those who oppose the Ori shall perish.
[He lifts his wrist weapon toward her and activates it. Another soldier
approaches. It is Tomin, but his head is covered by his helmet.]
TOMIN
Stop!
ORI FIRSTMAN
Commander. All those here have resisted with force.
TOMIN
(taking off his helmet)
And they shall be punished.
VALA
Tomin.
TOMIN
Have her taken to the rings. Transport her to the ship.
[The soldier orders others to take Vala away. The take her by the arms
and pull her with them.]
TOMIN
Kill the rest.
[Four First Men take aim with their staff weapons. The villagers start
cowering and calling out in fear.]
VALA
No! Tomin? No! No! No!
[She yells for him to stop but the soldiers begin firing. Tomin looks
on with determination and some amount of resignation as the killing
proceeds. Afterward Vala is very upset and looks at Tomin angrily, but
he does not look back. The soldiers take her away. Nearby some soldiers
pass frightened villagers who are watching from inside a building.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Carter is unconscious on the floor. Mitchell is working on her wounds,
specifically the exit wound on her back. He has a full med kit opened
with gauze, retractors, and vials of morphine. There is bloody gauze on
the floor. Carter wakes up suddenly and gasps in pain.]
MITCHELL
Hold still, hold still! Hang on a minute. This'll help you.
[He grabs a syringe of morphine and injects it into her leg. He goes
back to work on the wound.]
CARTER
How long was I out?
MITCHELL
Well unfortunately, not long enough for me to finish this. Just hang
on.
[She grimaces and groans as he continues.]
CARTER
What's going on outside?
MITCHELL
The shooting has stopped. The Ori army's in control.
[Carter sees a soldier enter the room.]
CARTER
Cam!
[Mitchell lifts his weapon and points it. But the soldier is in the
normal dimension and can't seem them. He passes through the wall and
continues his patrol.]
MITCHELL
Damn it, Sam! Don't scare me like that.
CARTER
(confused)
What?!
MITCHELL
Oh, the uh, device is on. I forgot to mention that.
CARTER
Yeah.
MITCHELL
I don't know how big the field is. I think you and I are the only
ones inside it.
CARTER
Teal'c and Vala?
MITCHELL
Oh, I tried to contact them on the radio, but there's no response.
CARTER
Well, that could mean anything.
MITCHELL
It could. Hey, we'll pull through this, Sam.
[She whimpers in pain as he continues to work on her wound.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE P9C-882
[An Ori ship is in orbit around the planet.]
INT--BEDROOM ON ORI WARSHIP
[Vala sits on the edge of a bed in the room. There are candles lit, an
Ori torch burning, and a large wooden table with books and scrolls on
it. The doors slide open, and Tomin enters. He closes the door behind
him. Vala is dressed in her BDU's, and Tomin in a blue cloth uniform
with an Ori emblem over his heart. There is a blue dress laid out on
the bed beside Vala.]
TOMIN
Why are you still wearing the clothes of a blasphemer?
VALA
(touching the dress)
If I put on this dress, and say "hallowed are the Ori," will you
stop mass murdering innocent people?
[He turns back to the door as if to leave.]
VALA
Tomin, wait.
[He stops but does not turn back toward her.]
VALA
I know you think that everything that comes out of my mouth is a
lie. I've deceived you too many times to change that now. But
there's one thing I want you to know that is the truth. There were
real moments between us. I did fall in love with you. In your heart
you were a good man; not because Origin told you to be. I know you
can't possibly like what you've become -- what this faith has made
you do!
TOMIN
After all that time we spent together, you still know nothing about
me.
VALA
I know you must still love me. Why else would I be here?
[He turns and walks toward her.]
TOMIN
(intensely)
If it were up to me, I would light the fire that would burn you
alive for your desecration. The only reason you are still here is
because it was so ordered by the Orici. You will remain in this
room. You will see no one; you will speak to no one. You will be
educated in the ways of Origin until such time as evil no longer
possesses you.
[He walks back to the door.]
VALA
No, Tomin. I'm--I'm--I'm street-smart. That's always got me by, but
I have to warn you, I've never been much for school.
TOMIN
I am to teach you. This is my punishment for allowing you to deceive
me. If you continue to resist, you will die.
[He leaves.]
EXT--CLEARING IN FRONT OF GATE ON P9C-882, DAY
[Ori soldiers stand guard, and Ori fighters speed by overhead.]
INT--VILLAGE BUILDING
[Matar, Thilana, and other villagers are crowded into a large room.
Thilana helps an injured girl to sit up. Teal'c arrives, disguised by a
large hooded cloak. He removes the hood.]
THILANA
Teal'c!
TEAL'C
Thilana. I am happy to see that you are uninjured.
THILANA
You as well. Where's the rest of your team?
TEAL'C
I was hoping that you had seen them.
THILANA
I have not.
[Matar approaches them.]
MATAR
I have spoken to many others, Thilana. We have decided that as
village leader, you must go forward to the Prior and embrace Origin
on our behalf.
THILANA
What? You have no right!
MATAR
You see how powerful they are!
TEAL'C
A poor reason to abandon one's beliefs.
MATAR
(resentful)
This no longer concerns you! Your attempts to have us resist have
only led to death.
TEAL'C
My concerns extend to those who would worship false gods. The Ori
are not worthy of your devotion.
MATAR
Well, gods or not, their power is real. The same cannot be said for
your people. You pledged to protect us, but when the time came, you
failed to do so.
(to Thilana)
And we have no choice. We shall bow down to the Ori and beg for
their mercy, or we shall all perish.
[He walks away. Thilana looks at Teal'c with foreboding.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Carter lies on the cot, covered by a grey blanket. She gasps in pain.
Mitchell hears from where he is standing near the window.]
MITCHELL
Is it getting worse?
CARTER
Not getting better.
[He walks over to her.]
MITCHELL
Listen, I've been thinking...
CARTER
Uh oh.
[He sits on a metal case beside her.]
MITCHELL
Yeah. Dangerous, I know.
[He prepares another syringe.]
MITCHELL
I can leave the field and still stay out of phase, right?
[He injects the drug into her leg.]
MITCHELL
So I was thinking I'd take some C4 and plant it around the village,
come back here, use the explosions as a distraction to--
[He sees her shaking her head in disagreement.]
MITCHELL
What? You haven't heard the rest of the plan.
CARTER
You can't leave the device here.
MITCHELL
Well, I was gonna save some C4 for that as well.
CARTER
You cannot sacrifice the device for me. It is still our best chance
against the Ori.
MITCHELL
No offense, but that gizmo's not showing a whole lot of promise
right now.
CARTER
It'll work. It just wasn't ready for this. I'm probably not gonna
make it, either way.
MITCHELL
No! Don't you start to talk like that.
CARTER
(weakly, nearly crying)
Cam... you have to face the fact that I'm gonna die here.
MITCHELL
No, I don't have to face that fact, because I am not gonna let it
happen.
CARTER
(crying, trying to convince him)
I appreciate that. But the truth is, even if you manage to create a
distraction and destroy the device, you are never gonna get me to
the gate by yourself.
MITCHELL
Yes I will.
CARTER
Not alive.
[Mitchell closes his eyes and puts his hand to his face.]
INT--BEDROOM, ORI WARSHIP
[Vala is lying on a couch, facing away from Tomin, who is sitting at
the large wooden table and reading the Book of Origin aloud to her. She
is still wearing her BDU's and appears weary of listening.]
TOMIN
So it came to pass that Ver Omesh was gripped by a great famine. So
Markon went to the Prophet Articus and asked to go to the forest for
food.
[Vala turns over on the couch and faces Tomin over the edge of it.]
VALA
How many people have you killed? Do you keep track? Put little
notches in your Ori belt?
TOMIN
(after looking up for a moment)
The prophet bade him be patient, for the Ori provide for all who
have faith. But Markon did not believe.
VALA
Do you remember their faces... or are there too many of them?
[She stands and walks over to the table, then sits in the chair on the
other side of the table from him.]
VALA
Hundreds?... Thousands?
[He looks up with anger on his face then resumes.]
TOMIN
So the prophet drew a line in the sand and told him, 'step across
and you may do as you wish.' So Markon did and left the village and
feasted on wild berries.
VALA
(walking around the table to stand beside him)
What about the stories in there that are all about not killing?
TOMIN
(slamming his hand on the table and screaming)
Enough!
(more calmly)
They were each given a chance to save themselves. Those who do not
walk the path are not worthy.
VALA
(going to her knee beside him)
You can preach all you want to me, Tomin, but I know that's not what
you believe!
TOMIN
(speaking over her, more quickly)
The fruit was bitter. It did not satisfy him. He longed to return to
the village, but found that the line had widened to a great chasm.
VALA
I've read the book. I've read it. I understand why you think it's so
important. The words give you comfort, and at face value it appears
to be as if that they are trying to inspire the best out of people.
Honesty, morality--
[Tomin begins reading over her before she is half way finished.]
TOMIN
He called out to the Prophet in fear, but the Prophet said, 'The
line has not changed; it is you who have changed. Step across if you
truly believe--'
[She speaks over him, causing him to stop.]
VALA
This whole crusade is a manipulation. Nothing in there says that
those who don't believe should be massacred. Where does it say that,
Tomin? Where does it say that?
[She again speaks over his reading of the next passage.]
TOMIN
(more angry and frustrated)
So Markon prayed for forgiveness and took the first step. And the
hands of the Ori envel--
VALA
The Ori are not gods!
[Furious, Tomin back-hands Vala hard across the face. She falls to the
floor, crying out. He stands up. She sits up partially and touches the
blood on her mouth.]
VALA
You should kill me now.
[He looks at her for just a moment as he turns and leaves the room.]
INT--BUILDING IN VILLAGE
[The Ori Firstman enters the building where Thilana and the others
wait. Teal'c's face is covered by his hood.]
ORI FIRSTMAN
There is a building in the village square that disappeared upon our
arrival. You will tell me what trickery is being used to conceal it.
[Thilana stands and walks to him.]
THILANA
I am Thilana, leader of this village. We do not know what magic is
at work, but it strikes me, by your asking us lowly peasants, you're
saying that the great power of the Ori cannot see past such
deception?
ORI FIRSTMAN
I ask you, so that you may show the Ori the error of your ways. If
you do not bow, your village will be burned to the ground!
[He directs his last threat to everyone in the room. Matar appears very
fearful. After a moment the Firstman turns to leave. Matar stands up.]
MATAR
Wait!
THILANA
(commanding him)
Matar, no.
MATAR
(to Thilana)
You would stand by while more of our people are murdered?! To
protect the identities of those who have failed us?
ORI FIRSTMAN
What do you speak of?
[Matar steps over to Teal'c, who is crouching on the floor, facing away
from the soldiers.]
MATAR
This man is not of our village. He came with the others to try to
conceal us.
[Matar reaches for Teal'c's hood. Teal'c grabs his arm instead, then
stands up and pushes him backward. Teal'c turns to face the soldiers
and lowers his hood. The firstman looks at him in surprise, if not
recognition.]
ORI FIRSTMAN
(to Matar)
You have served the Ori well, my friend.
(to the other soldiers)
Seize him!
[The soldiers grab Teal'c. He nods to Thilana.]
ORI FIRSTMAN
(indicating Thilana and Matar)
Both of them, as well.
[Matar appears to feel betrayed. All three of them are led from the
building.]
INT--BEDROOM, ORI WARSHIP
[Vala sits in the chair beside the large table, her feet resting on it.
Tomin enters.]
TOMIN
Forgive me for striking you.
VALA
Hitting me is nothing compared to the lives that you mercilessly
extinguished. You can never make up for that, Tomin. I thought that
I could save you, but I realize now, it's too late.
TOMIN
Yes it is. You'll never see me again.
[He turns to go but turns back toward her when she begins speaking.]
VALA
One last story. For me.
[She stands up and leans against the table.]
VALA
A long time ago, some people just like you and me, over time
evolved. And they became so advanced that they figured out how to
turn themselves into energy and ascend to a higher plane of
existence. I know...
[She steps closer to him. He appears to only be tolerating what she is
saying.]
VALA
...it sounds crazy, but it happened. Then they discovered that if
regular humans worshipped them, that made them more powerful. So
they used their knowledge to make as many people as they could and
then created a religion that would force them to prostrate in their
name. The more prostrating, the more power. The religion said that
these beings were benevolent, but they couldn't offer their
followers ascension, because that would mean they'd have to share
their power. They just use people up and throw them away. I know
I'll never convince you otherwise, but everything you believe... is
a lie.
[Unmoved, he turns, steps out of the room, and closes it behind him.]
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[A Prior arrives. Teal'c, Thilana, and Matar are kneeling on the ground
where the other villagers had been slaughtered.]
PRIOR
Tell me what you know.
[The Prior activates the crystal on his staff. Teal'c begins to grimace
as if he is resisting some attempt to enter his mind. After a few
moments, Teal'c falls over, unconscious.]
MATAR
(pleading and panicked)
Please! Prior! We were misled. The outsiders tried to convince us
the Ori were false gods.
THILANA
(warning him)
Matar.
MATAR
Forgive us, for we are now ready to embrace the teachings of Origin
with open hearts.
PRIOR
Tell me. Do you know how the outsiders have concealed themselves?
[Matar looks at Thilana. The Prior looks at her too and smiles mildly.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell watches what is going on in the square from a window.]
MITCHELL
This is not good.
[He looks at Carter, who seems to be in a restless sleep.]
MITCHELL
Hey!
[He walks over to her cot and crouches beside it, then touches Carter
on the arm.]
MITCHELL
Carter, wake up! No sleeping.
CARTER
(weakly)
My laptop. There's a file.
MITCHELL
You want me to get it?
[She shakes her head 'no'.]
CARTER
In my personal directory. Letters mostly.
MITCHELL
(sadly)
Sam.
CARTER
There's one to Cassie... some other people. Password's "fishing."
MITCHELL
Ah, see?
[He turns and sits on the metal case beside the cot.]
MITCHELL
Now you're gonna have to change the password. Sam, don't give up on
me. You've gotta think of my position here. I worked my ass off to
get this team back together. Now we've lost... well, we've lost
Jackson. I can't lose you, too.
CARTER
I spent my entire life dedicated to science. Spent the last ten
years, trying to convince people they believed in false gods. I
don't feel like science is gonna help me. Right now, I'm just hoping
somewhere one of those gods...
MITCHELL
My grandma used to say, "God is like a prairie windstorm. If you
look too hard, you get dust in your eyes, but there's still plenty
of ways to know it's there."
CARTER
Is that what you believe?
MITCHELL
I generally just nodded until she gave me a macaroon. There is one
thing that I do know is true. The mind is a powerful thing. No
matter who or what you believe in, sometimes belief itself makes all
the difference in the world. You just don't give up. Tell yourself
whatever you have to. Just believe you're gonna make it, Sam.
[The Prior walks through the wall into the room with them.]
MITCHELL
Oh crap.
[The Prior steps to the center of the room. He concentrates and
activates his staff. It glows very brightly, even causing those outside
in the square to shield their eyes. Carter and Mitchell look on
quietly. The Prior turns the staff off but remains standing there as if
listening for something. Mitchell approaches him.]
MITCHELL
Guess your little bag of tricks don't work on us, huh?
PRIOR
(looking around but not seeing Mitchell)
Show yourself, or this village will be destroyed!
[After a moment, frustrated, the Prior leaves.]
MITCHELL
Score one for science.
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
[The Prior walks toward the square.]
EXT--SPACE ABOVE P9C-882
[The Ori ship is in orbit around the planet.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RING ROOM ON ORI WARSHIP
[Tomin greets the Prior on his arrival from the planet. The Prior
starts to walk down the corridor then stops with his back to Tomin as
Tomin speaks to him.]
TOMIN
Prior, I beg forgiveness for my failure in teaching the mother of
the Orici.
PRIOR
You have only just begun, Tomin.
TOMIN
Please allow me to recuse myself; she is intolerable. I fear I will
be of no further use. My skills are much better spent as a
commander.
PRIOR
Indeed. You have proven yourself a ruthless and skillful warrior,
and a fine leader.
TOMIN
Thank you. I'll head straight back down to the planet.
[He starts to go but is stopped by the Prior's words.]
PRIOR
That won't be necessary. We are done here.
TOMIN
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[The Prior turns to face him.]
PRIOR
The village will be destroyed.
TOMIN
Why?
PRIOR
They have been touched by evil. There is no salvation for them.
TOMIN
But we eliminated all of the unbelievers.
PRIOR
Not all of them.
TOMIN
I thought the village had capitulated. If you'll allow me.
[He again starts to leave, then stops. The Prior faces away from him
again.]
PRIOR
(strongly)
Markon walked away from the Ori to satisfy his hunger. But no matter
how much he ate, he did not feel full. Realizing his mistake, he ran
back to the Ori. But they denied his pleas and struck down the
village that welcomed him back.
TOMIN
(approaching the Prior from behind him)
Forgive me Prior, but I was reviewing that very passage just this
morning. Markon prayed for forgiveness and took the first step.
PRIOR
And the hands of the Ori enveloped all those who welcomed him back.
The village was destroyed. All those who stand by and accept
transgressions must be punished.
[Tomin steps around the Prior to face him again.]
TOMIN
(challenging)
That is not the implication of the text, Prior. The Ori granted
forgiveness when Markon realized his mistake, and blessed the
village with their light for showing him the way back to the path!
PRIOR
(becoming angry)
You dare question my judgment?
TOMIN
No; it's just not how I was taught.
PRIOR
There are many words, but only one truth!
[Somberly, Tomin watches the Prior walk away.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell watches as Ori soldiers run past the window and out of the
village.]
MITCHELL
They're gonna clear out and bomb the village from orbit.
(turning back to Carter)
I reckon we'll be okay. The device will be preserved, and they'll go
away thinking they wiped us out. But they're gonna kill all those
people.
CARTER
I know.
MITCHELL
So what are we gonna do about it?
[Carter looks at him uncertainly.]
INT--VILLAGE BUILDING
[Teal'c is lying on a cot. He awakens, and Thilana comes slowly into
focus.]
THILANA
(touching him on the shoulder)
Teal'c? I'm so sorry. I told the Prior of the device. He decreed
that the village will be destroyed if your friends do not show
themselves.
[Matar and several men from the village enter. Matar holds a long
knife, and the others various primitive weapons. Recognizing the
threat, Teal'c rolls off the cot and stands, weakly. Thilana steps
between Teal'c and the men.]
MATAR
Stand aside, Thilana.
THILANA
What do you think you're doing?
MATAR
He must be sacrificed... to show the Ori we are not allied with
them.
THILANA
You will do no such thing!
MATAR
If you stand in the way, you too will be shown no mercy.
[Teal'c gives him a scathing look.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell is near Merlin's device.]
MITCHELL
So what we gotta do is, we have to expand the field around the
village, just for a little while.
CARTER
There's not enough power.
MITCHELL
(approaching her)
Carter! Come on! There's gotta be something.
[She groans and moves in pain.]
MITCHELL
Hang on, hang on, I'll get you some morphine.
[He leans down to grab a syringe. She looks past him to the dead Ori
soldier, whose staff weapon is still beside him. Mitchell is about to
inject her when she stops him.]
CARTER
Wait. I need to think clearly. There might still be a way.
INT--VILLAGE BUILDING
THILANA
Matar, killing Teal'c will prove nothing. If these gods are truly
worthy of our devotion, then pray to them. No god should ever ask
you to kill an innocent man to prove your sanctity. I know you're
afraid. We all are. But if we are going to die, let us die in noble
peace and truth of spirit.
[As she speaks, Matar begins crying, and his knife shakes in his hand.
She quietly takes it from him. Teal'c nods his head at them.]
INT--BEDROOM, ORI WARSHIP
[Vala is asleep on the bed. Tomin sits beside her.]
TOMIN
Why do they not reveal themselves?
[She hears him and wakes with a start. She sits up.]
VALA
(confused)
Who?
TOMIN
Your friends. They're concealing a building on the planet's surface.
The Prior plans to destroy the village because of them. Hundreds
will die because of your friends' treachery.
VALA
Innocent people.
TOMIN
Yes.
VALA
You're not happy about that.
TOMIN
No... He twisted the meaning.
VALA
Who?
TOMIN
The Prior. He changed the meaning of the story of Markon to suit the
situation... to justify killing villagers.
VALA
Well, if you think that's wrong you should do something about it.
TOMIN
He's a Prior.
VALA
Tomin, those people down there don't have to die, and you're the
only one who can do something about it.
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell removes the crystal from the Ori staff weapon and holds it up
for Carter to see.]
MITCHELL
You wanna use this?
CARTER
(nodding)
The power crystal in Merlin's device was depleted. That's why we
needed the naquadah generators.
MITCHELL
I'm sorry, is that not apples and oranges?
CARTER
Ancient and Ori technology is similar. We can make it work for a
short time.
MITCHELL
Fine. So what do I do?
CARTER
Put the crystal in the back of the device.
[He opens a small drawer on the side of Merlin's device.]
MITCHELL
Got it.
[He tries to insert the crystal but it doesn't fit.]
MITCHELL
It's too big. It doesn't fit.
CARTER
Power interface adapter.
MITCHELL
What?
CARTER
The connector... generator to Ancient tech. Ahh...
[He approaches her.]
MITCHELL
Carter! Carter! You've had a lot of morphine, so I want you to
explain it to me so that it makes sense.
INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP
[The Prior sits in the command chair, holding his staff. The planet is
visible in the view screen. Tomin enters and stands to the side of the
Prior, who does not look at him.]
TOMIN
Excuse me, Prior.
PRIOR
Come in, Tomin. It is good that you have seen your way clear.
Hallowed are those who walk in unison.
TOMIN
Forgive me, Prior, but I am still troubled. I believe we are in
error. The people of the village have expressed a willingness to
seek the truth. I believe they are in earnest. Do not the Ori wish
all who seek their wisdom to follow the path?
PRIOR
I'm disappointed, Tomin. It seems that you have begun to question
the will of the Ori. Or is it the unbeliever under your tutelage
that has corrupted you.
TOMIN
(getting louder and more insistent until he is shouting)
No. I have not begun to question the will of the Ori, but I have
begun to question the interpretation of their words. No matter what
you say, I will not believe the Book of Origin asks us to massacre
innocent people! And I will not stand by while the holy doctrine of
good will and faith that I have sworn to uphold is twisted into a
hammer and used to beat people down!
[The Prior stands.]
PRIOR
(screaming, still not looking at Tomin)
How dare you!
[Tomin stares at him in anger.]
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
[Mitchell has placed the crystal in a small adapter that he has
connected to the drawer of Merlin's device with a metal clip. He pushes
a metal probe into the other side of the drawer. He receives a shock
and yelps, then puts his finger in his mouth.]
CARTER
That's a good sign.
MITCHELL
That's easy for you to say. You with the little flesh wound. All
right, what next?
CARTER
Laptop.
[He brings the laptop to her. It is still connected to the device by a
cable. He puts in on her legs then helps her sit up. She calls out in
pain. The bandages around her abdomen are bloody.]
MITCHELL
You okay?
CARTER
No.
MITCHELL
RIght.
[He sits partially behind her, helping hold her up.]
INT--BRIDGE OF ORI WARSHIP
[The Prior and Tomin are as they were. The Ori steps forward toward the
view screen.]
PRIOR
Behold, the hand of the Ori at work!
EXT--SPACE ABOVE P9C-882
[The warship begins to fire energy weapons on a single spot on the
planet -- the village.]
INT--BEDROOM ON ORI WARSHIP
[Tomin comes rushing in.]
VALA
What happened?
[He grabs her forearms.]
TOMIN
Come with me.
VALA
(taking his action as hostile)
Let go of me!
TOMIN
The Prior destroyed the village. There was nothing I could do. Now
keep silent please, for both our sakes.
[He pulls her out of the room with him.]
INT--CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RING ROOM ON ORI WARSHIP
[Tomin brings Vala down the corridor and into the ring room.]
INT--RING ROOM ON ORI WARSHIP
[They enter. He closes the door.]
TOMIN
The ship's about to break orbit. They'll probably kill me for this,
but I'm going to ring you down to the planet.
VALA
Come with me. Please. Tomin?
TOMIN
You're right. I still love you.
VALA
(smiling)
Then come!
[He kisses her, his hands on her face.]
TOMIN
(backing away)
This is all that I can do.
VALA
No Tomin, you can do more!
[He activates the rings; she appears disappointed as they form around
her.]
EXT--SURFACE OF P9C-882, DAY
[Vala walks alone in what appears to be a smoking crater where the
village used to be.]
VALA
Hello? Anyone?
[The village and all its people suddenly appear around her. Teal'c is
behind her.]
TEAL'C
Vala Mal Doran.
[She turns and runs to him, leaping up and wrapping her legs around his
waist.]
TEAL'C
Colonel Carter was able to expand the range of the device in time.
TEAL'C
(into radio)
Colonel Mitchell. Vala Mal Doran is here.
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
MITCHELL
(into radio)
That's good news. Do we know if that ship has left?
EXT--VILLAGE ON P9C-882, DAY
VALA
(into Teal'c's radio)
As far as I know it has.
INT--VILLAGE LIBRARY
MITCHELL
(into radio)
Okay. Look, Carter's in bad shape. We need a med team here right
away.
[Carter lies unconscious on the cot.]
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY
INT--SGC INFIRMARY
[Carter is in bed, working on her laptop. A nurse smiles and leaves
her. Mitchell stands in the doorway.]
MITCHELL
Hey there! You're looking better.
CARTER
Thanks.
[She closes the laptop.]
CARTER
A few more weeks and I should be back in action.
MITCHELL
(stepping up to her bed)
Yeah, no, I don't want to rush you.
CARTER
Listen, Cam--
MITCHELL
Sam, don't say a word.
[She nods.]
MITCHELL
(handing her a brown paper bag)
Here. I baked you some macaroons.
CARTER
You baked them?
MITCHELL
Yeah, Grandma's recipe.
CARTER
Wow! Thanks.
MITCHELL
Go on, try one.
[She looks inside the bag but doesn't seem interested.]
CARTER
You know what? Maybe a little later.
MITCHELL
You don't like macaroons?
CARTER
It's just that I'm still a little queasy.
MITCHELL
Well, try one, they'll make you feel better. Here, I'll get you a
good one.
[He sits on the side of the bed and pulls one out for her, smells it,
then gives it to her. She takes a bite but obviously doesn't like it.]
MITCHELL
Pretty good, huh?
CARTER
(nodding but clearly lying)
Actually, they are pretty good.
MITCHELL
You hate it.
CARTER
Yep. Sorry.
[She tosses the cookie back into the bag.]
MITCHELL
(shrugging)
Well, to each their own.
CARTER
Thank you.
[They nod to each other, and he pats her on the shoulder.]
