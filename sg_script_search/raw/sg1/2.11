TEASER
[Flashbacks series including scenes from episodes In The Line of Duty,
in which Jolinar and the Tok'ra are introduced, and Secrets, where we
meet General Jacob Carter and learn of his terminal cancer diagnosis.]
INT--UNIDENTIFIED TOK'RA TUNNELS
[In the Tok'ra tunnels, people rush about in chaos as the Jaffa attack.
Weapons are fired and there is a frenzied panic as people scramble to
save themselves and to fight back. The view is shot from Jolinar's
point of view.]
MARTOUF
We have to activate the Chappa'ai. Quickly, Jolinar!
[Jolinar runs towards the Stargate. Her hands are seen dialing an
address.]
MARTOUF
Jolinar, hurry!
[Jolinar's reflection is caught in some particularly shiny crystal.
It's Sam's face. Suddenly, Sam sits bolt upright in a bed in the SGC
infirmary. There are sensors attached to her forehead hooked up to
monitors.]
CARTER
(Astonished)
I think I might have found something!

OPENING CREDITS
INT--SGC BRIEFING ROOM
[Hammond, Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c are seated. O'Neill is pouring
himself a cup of coffee.]
O'NEILL
You don't think it was just a dream.
CARTER
No, Sir. It was real. I could tell.
HAMMOND
You could tell.
CARTER
Yes, Sir. I don't know how, exactly, but I could tell.
O'NEILL
So we're supposed into buy this...ESP, or whatever it is?
TEAL'C
O'Neill, when a Goa'uld infests its host, their minds intermingle,
become as one. It is possible that portions of Jolinar of Malk-shur
remain in Captain Carter's mind.
CARTER
These Tok'ra were on the run. They may be in trouble. Now, if we
want to find them again, we should find them before they move on.
They may still be at these coordinates.
DANIEL
Now, you said their eyes glowed. Are you really sure that these
Tok'ra are what Jolinar said they were? I mean, good guys,
for...lack of a better word.
CARTER
Yes.
O'NEILL
Yes? Just yes? Could you elaborate a little?
CARTER
I'm sorry Colonel. I know it's hard to understand. I don't really
understand it myself, but I am sure. I...I just know.
TEAL'C
According to Jaffa legend, the Tok'ra are the Goa'uld resistance.
Their stated goal is the destruction of the System Lords and a
change in the ways of the empire. They are hunted and despised by
the Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Yes! My kinda guys!
CARTER
General Hammond, if I may. My vision is the only lead we have to go
on. Shouldn't we at least check it out before they move on?
O'NEILL
Colonel?
O'NEILL
General?
HAMMOND
I'm prepared to send SG-1 through to the coordinates Captain Carter
saw in her vision, if you agree.
CARTER
Colonel, I know you're skeptical about these things, but I am
confident that I am right on this one.
[O'Neill ponders the idea momentarily as the team wait.]
O'NEILL
Let's check it out.
INT--SGC CORRIDOR
[SG-1 are in their gear, walking down a corridor.]
CARTER
Colonel, is it all right if I catch up with you?
O'NEILL
We leave in ten.
CARTER
Only need five.
[Carter breaks off from the group.]
INT--SGC CONTROL ROOM
[At a desk in the corner of the room, Sam picks up the phone.]
CARTER
Dad, hi, it's me, Sam.
(Pauses)
What do you mean, why am I calling? Dad? You just told me that you
have cancer, you can't...
(Pauses)
All right, okay, never mind. Listen, uh, I'm about to go on a little
trip.
(Pauses)
Yes, it's for the Air Force.
[Hammond walks up and notices her on the phone.]
CARTER
It's...it's not important where I'm going Dad. What's important is
that I may be gone a while, and I just wanted to call and see how
you're doing.
(Pauses)
You're sure?
[Sam puts the phone down and gets up to leave for the Gate Room.
General Hammond watches then walks up to her.]
HAMMOND
Your father?
CARTER
Yes, Sir.
HAMMOND
How is Jacob?
CARTER
He claims he's okay, not that he'd tell me if he weren't. Did you
know he actually got an apartment here in town?
HAMMOND
He wanted to be closer to his daughter during...
CARTER
During his last days. Sir, this is the first time I've left on a
mission where I've felt like I might be leaving something behind.
Like I might miss something important.
HAMMOND
Understandable. I'll put a temporary replacement on SG-1. You can
stay here.
CARTER
I wish I could, Sir, but I don't think I'm replaceable on this one.
The memories Jolinar left in my mind could be invaluable on this
mission and no one else has them.
HAMMOND
True, but your father...
CARTER
Sir, it's okay, he doesn't want me around anyway.
HAMMOND
Sam, I've known Jacob a long time. That's not true.
CARTER
Sir, he's always too concerned about appearing the strong soldier.
The last thing he would want is for me to see him in a hospital bed
losing a battle. I should get going Sir, I don't wanna hold things
up.
[She turns to walk away.]
HAMMOND
Captain!
[Sam stops and turns to look at Hammond.]
HAMMOND
You're more like your father than you'd like to admit.
[Sam considers his words then leaves.]
EXT--PRESUMABLY THE TOK'RA PLANET
[SG-1 emerge on a desert planet. All glance briefly at their
surroundings.]
TEAL'C
There is no evidence of footprints or tracks of any kind. If the
Tok'ra were here they have not been near the Gate in many days.
O'NEILL
Ah, where's that yellow brick road when you need it, eh Dorothy?
[Teal'c lifts an eyebrow at O'Neill.]
CARTER
There's some sort of dunes over there.
O'NEILL
Dunes it is.
[They walk towards the dunes. As they start off, the come across the
broken MALP. Jack takes a look at it briefly.]
O'NEILL
Worthless.
EXT--TOK'RA PLANET
[They are still walking through the dunes.]
DANIEL
No one's tread here in a while.
TEAL'C
The Tok'ra are known for their ability to mask their trails. They
are, as you say, stealthy in their actions.
[Suddenly, humans pop out from their hiding places and quickly surround
SG-1. They all engage their staff weapons.]
DANIEL
Yeah, stealthy would be a good word, Teal'c.
O'NEILL
Good guys or bad guys?
[One of the Tok'ra approaches the team.]
CORDESH
We mean you no harm. But I warn you, if you make any aggressive
moves, we will fire upon you.
O'NEILL
Same here.
CORDESH
(Laughs)
Well, I think we have the advantage. There are more of us.
O'NEILL
This is true.
MARTOUF
(Angry)
This one is a Jaffa. Apophis sect.
TEAL'C
I am no longer in the service of Apophis.
MARTOUF
Who then are you in service to?
TEAL'C
I am allied with these, the Tau'ri, in battle against Apophis.
DANIEL
And all other Goa'uld.
CARTER
Be careful, Daniel.
DANIEL
Why?
CARTER
Because they are Goa'uld.
CORDESH
Do not call us that!
(Eyes glow)
We are not Goa'uld!
EXT--CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN ENTRANCE
INT--SGC HAMMOND'S OFFICE
[General Hammond is seated at his desk as his phone rings.
HAMMOND
Hammond. Put him through.
(Pauses)
Jacob? You okay?
(Pauses)
Oh no, I'll be right there.
EXT--THE TOK'RA PLANET
[Still among the dunes, SG-1 and the Tok'ra are still standing around
pointing weapons at each other.]
O'NEILL
You know, in some galaxies, this is called loitering. How long do ya
think we can keep it up?
[Carter studies Martouf, a look of recognition on her face.]
CARTER
Martouf.
MARTOUF
I do not know this woman.
CARTER
But I'm right, aren't I. That's your name, Martouf.
MARTOUF
It is. How do you know me?
CARTER
I don't. But I knew someone who did. His name was Jolinar of
Malk-shur.
CORDESH
Where is Jolinar?
CARTER
He died saving my life.
DANIEL
That's why we're here, to seek out the Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
Assuming of course you are the Tok'ra.
CORDESH
And if we're not?
O'NEILL
Well, I guess we all start shooting, there's blood, death, hard
feelings...it'd suck.
MARTOUF
And if we are this thing you call Tok'ra?
TEAL'C
If you are indeed the Tok'ra of Jaffa legend, we should form an
alliance.
CARTER
I learned a lot from Jolinar. Enough to know that we could be good
friends. And frankly, enough to know that you are the Tok'ra.
MARTOUF
I believe this one speaks the truth. Perhaps we should...just listen
to what they have to say.
[Cordesh raises his hand, and the Tok'ra lower their weapons, followed
by SG-1 doing the same.]
O'NEILL
Well that's better, isn't it? So, take me to your leader.
CORDESH
I will take you to whom you seek. But there is one condition. You
must leave your weapons with us.
O'NEILL
Ah, no.No.
CARTER
They won't hurt us, Colonel.
O'NEILL
They're Goa'ulds, Carter.
CARTER
They won't hurt us.
O'NEILL
And you, what, feel this?
CARTER
No, I can remember.
TEAL'C
O'Neill, if they are the Tok'ra, we are in no danger.
DANIEL
If you're asking for opinions, I vote we take the chance.
O'NEILL
Okay. But I want it understood that we're doing this in the spirit
of future relations. I expect us to be treated as such.
[SG-1 relinquish their weapons to the Tok'ra.]
MARTOUF
Please, come closer together.
O'NEILL
Why?
DANIEL
Jack.
CARTER
It's okay, Colonel.
O'NEILL
Oh, it is?
[Transport rings rise up from the ground and encircle SG-1, Cordesh,
and Martouf.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[The rings lower and release the group into the subterranean crystal
caves, which crackle alarmingly.]
CORDESH
This way.
[SG-1 follow them.]
CARTER
This looks just like the place in my dream. But that was on the
planet that we...they...were fleeing.
TEAL'C
It is said throughout the legend of the Tok'ra, when they arrive on
a planet they go deep underground, it is said they possess the
technology to actually grow tunnels.
CARTER
This looks like some sort of crystal material, so theoretically it
could be grown.
TEAL'C
Apophis had me searching for tunnels such as these for many years.
We never found them. It is believed when the Tok'ra move on, the
tunnels are destroyed.
O'NEILL
Carter, what's the story with this Martouf?
CARTER
I'm not sure. I get the feeling I know almost all of these people,
but my memories of Martouf are the strongest. It's like I have some
weird bond with him.
[Martouf ushers them into a room]
MARTOUF
Please, come this way.
EXT--HOSPITAL BUILDING
INT--JACOB CARTER'S HOSPITAL ROOM
[General Hammond enters Jacob's room. He's lying in the bed, taking
oxygen via nasal canula. Hammond goes over to stand next to the bed.]
JACOB
George.
HAMMOND
Jacob. Are you all right?
JACOB
I've been better.
HAMMOND
I was under the impression that the cancer hadn't gone this far.
JACOB
So was I. They cleaned out all the lymph nodes. The problem is,
apparently, one squadron of those little buggers got themselves
reassigned to my liver.
HAMMOND
Let me make a call, get Captain Carter recalled.
[Jacob catches Hammond's arm as the general reaches for the phone.]
JACOB
No, there's no need.
HAMMOND
Jacob, she should be here.
JACOB
Why? Let me tell you something George, my little girl grew up seeing
Daddy go off to God knows where to fight God knows who, and I always
came home alive and well. Now, I'm going to let her sit here and
watch me lose a war? To some little runts so small I can't even see
'em?
HAMMOND
That's exactly what she thought you'd say.
(Hammond hangs up the phone)
How about doing us all a favour, Jake.
JACOB
Huh?
HAMMOND
Cut the brave soldier routine. It's your daughter we're talking
about here. She should have a chance to be here to see you through
this.
JACOB
I got a feeling she's on a pretty important mission right now. Am I
right?
HAMMOND
Well, yes, but there are others...
JACOB
Then do me a favour and honour my wishes. Leave her there.
HAMMOND
This is ridiculous.
JACOB
There is one thing you could do for me, George.
HAMMOND
Anything.
JACOB
Tell me what my little girl's doing.
HAMMOND
Except that. You know it's classified.
JACOB
George, they're telling me I don't have much time left. Who am I
going to tell? God?
HAMMOND
I'm sorry, Jake.
[Jacob can only stare resignedly back at Hammond.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[Cordesh leads SG-1 into a big crystal room.
CORDESH
People of the Tau'ri, let me introduce Grand Council Garshaw of
Belote.
[A woman enters the room from behind Cordesh and stands before SG-1.]
GARSHAW
Greetings.
O'NEILL
Hi.
TEAL'C
You are Garshaw of Belote?
GARSHAW
I am.
TEAL'C
She is the most hunted Goa'uld of all time.
GARSHAW
We prefer you to not refer to us as Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
Yeah, we got that earlier. What should we call you?
GARSHAW
I assume you are from the first world, the Tau'ri. Is that correct?
O'NEILL
Yeah.
GARSHAW
Were you among those who rid the galaxy of the Supreme System Lord,
Ra?
O'NEILL
Yup, that's us, that...that...yeah, we're those.
GARSHAW
Then in a sense, you are Tok'ra.
DANIEL
Of course! Tok'ra. Tok...Tok Ra, against Ra! Thank you for sharing
that.
O'NEILL
We still don't know what to call her.
GARSHAW
We, too, are Tok'ra.
O'NEILL
Finally!
CARTER
It's a pleasure to meet you.
GARSHAW
I understand you were sent to us by Jolinar of Malk-shur. Please,
tell us how that came to be.
CARTER
Well, i...uh...it's a long story. We were on this planet, Nasya, and
the Goa'uld were attacking. Jolinar's host was killed, so he jumped
into me while I was trying to save his host.
MARTOUF
Please, excuse me. Did you say that Jolinar's host was killed?
CARTER
Yes. I'm sorry.
MARTOUF
But Jolinar lived on.
CARTER
Ah, yeah, for a while at least. Inside of me. Should I continue?
GARSHAW
Please.
INT--JACOB CARTER'S HOSPITAL ROOM
[A monitor shows that Jacob's heart has arrested and doctors are
scrambling to resuscitate him. A doctor reaches for the paddles.]
DOCTOR
He's in V-tach. Let's go. Let's shock him at...uh, 200.
NURSE
200.
DOCTOR
Okay, clear.
[Zaps him with the paddles]
[More hospital personnel rush into the room, and General Hammond
follows them in.]
DOCTOR
Again, 300.
NURSE
300.
DOCTOR
Clear.
[Zaps him with the paddles. Doctor checks monitor.]
DOCTOR
Normal sinus, okay.
(To Jacob)
Hey, General, how're you doing?
(To staff)
All right, he's in aplastic crisis. Let's give him a unit of packed
cells, check his vitals every fifteen minutes. And, er, let me know
if anything changes.
[The doctor starts to move out of the room.]
HAMMOND
Doctor.
DOCTOR
He's...uh...stable, for now.
HAMMOND
May I ask, how long does he have?
DOCTOR
Can't say with a cancer like this. Could be five days or five
minutes. Sorry. If there's any family for you to contact, I
recommend you get them here ASAP.
[The doctor leaves and Hammond is left to ponder what to do.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[SG-1 are standing, save for O'Neill who is seated as Tok'ra guard the
room and Garshaw, Cordesh, and Martouf address them.]
GARSHAW
So am I to understand you did not invite Jolinar to use you as a
host?
CARTER
That is correct. He did it in an emergency situation to escape an
assassin.
CORDESH
Then if you were not a voluntary host, how do we know that you did
not kill Jolinar yourself?
CARTER
Um, well, because I...I didn't. I mean, I guess you're just going to
have to trust us on that.
CORDESH
And why should we trust you?
[O'Neill rises from his seat, irritably.]
O'NEILL
You know something?
[He walks over to stand before Garshaw and Cordesh.]
O'NEILL
I've been asking myself the same damn question. Why should we trust
you. You are, after all, Goa'ulds.
[Daniel tries to quickly step in.]
DANIEL
Jack...!
O'NEILL
(Points a warning finger up toward Daniel)
Ah! Don't! We've done nothing but get interrogated here. Now, are we
prisoners? And are you Goa'ulds?
DANIEL
(Trying again)
J...
O'NEILL
(Again, with the finger to Daniel)
Neh!
GARSHAW
You are not and I have told you we are not Goa'uld.
O'NEILL
I didn't...Why do you talk like that? And what's with the glowing
eyes? Huh? Might it have something to do with a little reptilian
activity in your heads?
GARSHAW
We have symbiotic creatures within us, yes.
O'NEILL
Well then!
DANIEL
Well then, you can see how we might think you would be a danger to
humans. You take humans as hosts.
GARSHAW
Goa'uld take hosts. Tok'ra do not. Ours wish to be so.
MARTOUF
We have a truly symbiotic relationship.
DANIEL
No offence, but why would any human volunteer to be a host for a
Goa'uld?
[Garshaw bows her head momentarily, then lifts her face and steps
forward eagerly.]
YOSUF
Um...Perhaps I can...I can help you? I am Yosuf. I am Garshaw's
host. I speak freely without restraint or censor. All of us who
serve as hosts volunteer to do so freely.
DANIEL
Okay, well, maybe you can answer my question then. Why would any
human volunteer for...for that?
YOSUF
Well, with the blending I gain all of Garshaw's knowledge, her
wisdom
(Laughs)
more than any human could ever attain. And my lifespan is twice what
it would be without the blending. And for all this, all I have to do
is...share my physical body.
O'NEILL
So you've kind of got a little Faustian deal going here...selling
your soul for immortality.
YOSUF
What you understand as soul...remains intact.
DANIEL
So this...symbiotic relationship is what makes the Tok'ra different
from the Goa'uld.
YOSUF
Yes.
TEAL'C
It is also this that has thwarted the Tok'ra's efforts against the
Goa'uld.
YOSUF
Your Jaffa friend is correct. If you'd like to come with me, I will
show you what he means.
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS
[The still-guarded SG-1 follow Martouf and Yosuf to a room off the a
tunnel. In the room, a very elderly woman is lying on what appears to
be a crystal bed. Two women are administering care to her as she is
clearly unwell.]
YOSUF
Allow me to introduce Selmak.
MARTOUF
Her host's name is Saroosh. She is one of the oldest and wisest
among us, an important leader for our cause. However, she is
unfortunately very ill, and will soon die.
DANIEL
How old is she?
YOSUF
She will be 203 of your years in a few of your days.
DANIEL
I'm sorry. I was under the impression that Goa'uld lived much longer
than 200 years.
YOSUF
Goa'uld do, the Tok'ra don't.
CARTER
That's because you don't use the sarcophagus, right?
MARTOUF
That's correct. We believe to do so would drain the good from our
hearts.
DANIEL
I can vouch for that.
MARTOUF
That's why our numbers don't grow large enough to defeat the massive
forces aligned with System Lords.
CARTER
Zero or negative population growth. Since you won't take new hosts
by force, most of the time the Goa'uld dies with the host.
YOSUF
And this is what is about to happen to Selmak.
MARTOUF
Unless one of you wishes to volunteer to serve as a host.
O'NEILL
I'm going to pass on that.
DANIEL
Yes, although it does s...sound very fascinating, I think it's a
little too long term for me.
CARTER
(Upset)
I'm sorry, I've already been through that.
[Sam walks out. Martouf follows her. The others turn to follow her,
too.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS WATER ROOM
[Carter is leaning over a large water basin, wetting her face. Martouf
comes up behind her and touches her on the shoulder. She gasps and
turns to face him.]
MARTOUF
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
CARTER
You shouldn't sneak up on a person like that.
[Garshaw enters the room along with the rest of the team and Tok'ra
guards.]
YOSUF
We didn't mean to upset you with the suggestion of becoming a host.
O'NEILL
Well, as long as you take no for an answer.
MARTOUF
Be assured that we have never forced a human to become a host. It
goes against all that we believe in.
O'NEILL
Yeah, well, you know Captain Carter didn't exactly invite Jolinar
in.
CARTER
Yes Sir, but I believe he was sincere about wanting to leave me as
soon as he found another host.
O'NEILL
If he found one.
YOSUF
I'm curious, if you're not interested in becoming a host, then why
did you seek us out?
DANIEL
To form an alliance.
YOSUF
Yes, so you've said, but it's apparent that the thought of an
alliance disgusts you.
DANIEL
Wait a minute, you think by 'form an alliance' we mean we want to be
hosts?
YOSUF
Well what other sort of an alliance could a non-blended human and a
Tok'ra want to have?
O'NEILL
Well, we do have a common enemy, how about a friendship?
CARTER
We could share information.
TEAL'C
We can engage in battles, side by side.
[Yosuf ducks her head briefly the straigtens.]
GARSHAW
I do not believe you could be of any service to us. You are neither
strong enough, nor advanced enough.
O'NEILL
We're not?
TEAL'C
You are incorrect. It was these who destroyed two Goa'uld
motherships.
GARSHAW
(Advancing angrily)
That was you? We had operatives who died on board those vessels.
DANIEL
Oh boy.
CARTER
We...we were only defending our planet.
YOSUF
We didn't know that they had travelled to the Tau'ri. This
information, it explains a lot. At least now we know how and why out
operatives died, and for that we are truly grateful.
O'NEILL
So maybe we can be of service.
YOSUF
Perhaps you are correct. I will try to convince the Council of
Tok'ra to meet with you.
[She turns and starts to leave, walking past the guards who block the
exit.]
O'NEILL
Ah, excuse me?
[Yosuf stops and turns back.]
O'NEILL
Are we prisoners here?
YOSUF
Well, ah, until we decide what level of information to entrust to
you, um, we cannot allow you to roam this facility freely. I'm
sorry.
[She leaves. The guards remain in place.]
MARTOUF
(To Sam)
Would you like to take a walk on the surface?
O'NEILL
What?
CARTER
Why?
MARTOUF
I would like to hear more of Jolinar of Malk-shur.
CARTER
Okay.
O'NEILL
Well, yeah, sure.
MARTOUF
I'm only inviting Captain Carter. What we have to discuss is
private. I hope you understand.
O'NEILL
Actually, no, I don't.
CARTER
Colonel, I...I think I should go with him. I think I need to go with
him. There's a lot of questions he could answer about Jolinar.
MARTOUF
I assure you Sir, she will be very safe with me.
CARTER
Colonel, I need to do this, please.
O'NEILL
(Thinks about it)
Okay Son, but I want you to have her back by 11 o'clock. You
understand?
EXT--THE TOK'RA PLANET SURFACE
[Martouf and Sam are walking along a ridge near the Stargate.]
MARTOUF
You feeling any better?
CARTER
Yeah, thanks.
MARTOUF
Please, ah, tell me of Jolinar.
CARTER
I get the feeling you knew him way better than I ever did.
MARTOUF
I'm sure. For one thing, he was a she.
CARTER
What? You're kidding!
MARTOUF
Well, actually, that isn't accurate. The symbiote does not have a
gender. However, Jolinar has always been in female hosts.
CARTER
Well, actually, the host I found him in, her in, was a male.
MARTOUF
Really? Must have been another method of hiding from the Ashrak.
Tell me of Jolinar's last days.
CARTER
Well, it's kind of weird, it's like I'm left with these intuitions,
feelings. I know this, she sacrificed herself to save me. That
speaks a ton about her character as far as I'm concerned.
(Pauses)
I'm sorry, are you okay?
LANTASH
I'm sorry, Martouf is having a more difficult time handling this
than I am.
CARTER
So you're his symbiote, Lantash, right?
LANTASH
Yes. Martouf is the name of my host.
CARTER
Yeah, I knew that. I seem to know pretty much everything about you.
When I'm with you, I feel a different sort of, I don't know,
recognition, than I do with the other Tok'ra. Is there something
different about your relationship to Jolinar?
LANTASH
Jolinar and I were together for nearly...100 of your years. She was
my mate.
CARTER
Oh. Ho...How does that work? She was whose mate? Martouf or Lantash?
LANTASH
Both.
[Lantesh ducks his heads, then raises it.]
MARTOUF
(Smiling)
Now let me attempt an explanation. As I said before, ours is a truly
symbiotic relationship. So what I feel, Lantash feels. And what
Lantash feels, I feel.
CARTER
So when one of you is in love, you both feel it.
MARTOUF
Yes, we love as one. And, and we mourn as one.
CARTER
I'm sorry.
MARTOUF
Don't be sorry. We want you to truly comprehend this so that you'll
better understand us.
CARTER
Okay, well, I am curious. What..what was Jolinar's host like?
MARTOUF
Jolinar's host, Rosha, was very beautiful. She had eyes like the
oceans of Marloon, hair was the colour of the sand Abydos, and her
smile was, was as infectious as laughter. In fact, Rosha looked very
much like you Captain Carter. You are very beautiful. You'd make a
lovely new host for Selmak.
[Sam turns away.]
MARTOUF
I'm sorry, I...I've said something to offend you.
CARTER
No. Yes! It's difficult enough with just the remnants of Jolinar in
here. The last thing I need is another person...symbiote...whatever.
[Sam sits down on the edge of the ridge. Martouf stands a little way
away.]
MARTOUF
I didn't mean to upset you so.
[Martouf walks over to Sam and crouches down next to her.]
CARTER
It's just the thought of going through that again.
MARTOUF
Don't give it another moment's thought. It was an inappropriate
suggestion. Please understand that it came from honest, deep desire
to have Jolinar back in my life in some form.
CARTER
This must be what it feels like to be schizophrenic.
MARTOUF
What is schizophrenic?
CARTER
It's a mental illness humans have. It's like a split personality.
Two people in one brain. I mean, there's me, Samantha Carter, and
then there's this leftover part of Jolinar that feels things like...
MARTOUF
Like...?
CARTER
Like some pretty deep feelings for you.
MARTOUF
Jolinar's left this imprint on your mind?
CARTER
Yes.
MARTOUF
I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable, but...
CARTER
No! It's just...what you had, you and Jolinar, you were in love
longer than I've been alive! Hell, longer than I will be alive!
MARTOUF
She left this feeling with you? You can feel how she felt for me?
CARTER
Yes. And it's confusing the hell outta me.
MARTOUF
Why?
CARTER
Because it's not just in my mind like a memory, I feel it. Like I've
had this relationship with you for 100 years. I don't know if I can
describe it with words. What Jolinar felt for you, I don't even
think I'm capable of comprehending.
MARTOUF
Maybe there's another way you can communicate it. Perhaps in a way
other than words.
[They interlock their hands and gaze into one another's eyes seemingly
exchanging unspoken feeling. From behind the ridge, Daniel, Cordesh and
other Tok'ra rush up and come across them as they sit.]
DANIEL
Sam!
[She stares at Martouf, then pulls herself from the "spell".]
CARTER
Daniel.
[They let go of each other's hand.]
DANIEL
(Warily)
Learning a lot about Jolinar?
CARTER
Yeah, you'd be surprised how much.
DANIEL
Um, the Tok'ra Council's agreed to meet with us. Jack thought you
might want to be there.
CARTER
Yeah.
[Martouf helps her to her feet and they start back and Daniel pauses in
thought as they pass him.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS CORRIDOR
[Escorted by guards, SG-1 and Garshaw walk through the tunnels.]
CARTER
Quite the place you've got here.
TEAL'C
Is it true these facilities are grown?
GARSHAW
It is. When we arrive at the new base, we plant certain crystals,
and they grown into all that you see.
DANIEL
Wow.
[O'Neill notices Cordesh breaking off and watching as the Tok'ra and
the rest of SG-1 leave him alone unnoticed, O'Neill follows him.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS--CORDESH'S ROOM
[Cordesh walks into his room. O'Neill lurks just outside, then moves
closer to see what Cordesh is doing. Cordesh selects a box from his
collection of belongings, and when he opens it Jack sees it contains an
orb.]
CORDESH
May I help you?
O'NEILL
Uh, No, thanks, I was just looking around.
CORDESH
This is not the way to the new Council chambers.
O'NEILL
Oh! Well, I'm sorry.
CORDESH
But I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. These are
my private quarters.
O'NEILL
Not very private.
CORDESH
The Tok'ra hold no secrets from each other. There is no need for
doors or partitions. Can I show you back to your group?
O'NEILL
Uh, no, no thanks. I...I can find my way back.
[Jack leaves.]
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS--DIFFERENT AREA
[Daniel is walking beside Garshaw, Sam follows along with Teal'c and
their Tok'ra guards.]
DANIEL
How fast can you grow a facility like this?
GARSHAW
Quite rapidly. We build only as we need. That is why we are only now
adding the corridor and the Council chambers. See for yourselves.
[Jack finds his way back to the group, and they come to a tunnel that's
still expanding. SG-1 stand and gape in awe at as the blue crystal is
visibly stretching out into a new tunnel, moving off into the
distance.]
O'NEILL
What the hell?
INT--TOK'RA TUNNELS--COUNCIL CHAMBERS
[They walk into the Council Chambers escorted by guards. It's like the
other rooms, but it has a large, shiny table in it. ]
GARSHAW
This Chamber is newly grown. Until now we had no reason to convene
the Council of Tok'ra.
CARTER
So this is some sort of accelerated crystal growth?
GARSHAW
That is correct. We have learned to pattern the natural tendencies
of the crystal.
CARTER
Like a geode.
GARSHAW
People of the Tau'ri, allow me to introduce the Grand Council of the
Tok'ra.
[The Council consists of Cordesh and five other more colourfully
clothed people. ]
O'NEILL
Hiya folks, nice to meetcha.
DANIEL
Uh, we're very grateful. We're representatives of a planet called
Earth.
TEAL'C
It is an honour.
CORDESH
The council has reviewed your proposal of an alliance between our
peoples.
CARTER
And?
FEMALE TOKRA
We would like you to understand our situation. We are an illegal
resistance group within the Goa'uld. We are the most hunted, most
hated enemies of the System Lords.
O'NEILL
Hey, we haven't made too many friends along the way either.
TEAL'C
The secrets of the Tok'ra would never be revealed. It is not the way
of the Tau'ri.
CORDESH
Not intentionally. But you might be followed to us, you might be
tortured into revealing our whereabouts or a spy might be introduced
into your midst.
FEMALE TOK'RA
We would like to know what you have to offer us that is of
sufficient value to justify our exposure.
O'NEILL
Well, I think we've got a lot of things.
TEAL'C
The Tau'ri have become quite advanced.
DANIEL
I'm sure we have something you could use.
GARSHAW
Please, give us an example.
O'NEILL
Sure. Daniel.
DANIEL
Er, well, I mean, after all, we...we have the same goals in mind.
CARTER
Perhaps there's some technology that could be of use.
CORDESH
Technology other than our own is useless to us. We are infiltrators.
We work from within the Goa'uld. Therefore it is important that we
appear to be Goa'uld.
[Another Tok'ra enters the Chamber and whispers to Garshaw. ]
GARSHAW
(Angrily)
Bring them in!
(To SG-1)
What are your people planning?
O'NEILL
Beg your pardon?
GARSHAW
The Chaapa-ai just activated, and brought forth these!
[SG-3 are led in weaponless and looking sheepish.]
CARTER
SG-3.
O'NEILL
Colonel Makepeace? What are you doing here?
MAKEPEACE
General Hammond sent us to extract Captain Carter.
CARTER
Why?
MAKEPEACE
I'm afraid it's your father, Captain. He's in the hospital in a
serious condition.
O'NEILL
You have to let her go home.
GARSHAW
I'm sorry, I cannot do that.
O'NEILL
Why not?
GARSHAW
I'm afraid we have made our decision. We have decided not to accept
your request for an alliance.
CORDESH
Therefore you shall be our guests until such time as we decide to
move to another planet.
O'NEILL
What?
GARSHAW
I'm sure you understand with your knowledge of this planet, you have
become a security risk. We cannot allow you to leave until we have
moved somewhere else that you do not know about.
DANIEL
Well surely as Tok'ra you're more compassionate than that? Captain
Carter's father is dying, I mean at least let her go.
CORDESH
She is the highest risk of all. She contains the memory of Jolinar
of Malk-shur.
TEAL'C
We are not the only ones who have knowledge of this planet. Those we
left behind on the Tau'ri also possess this knowledge.
O'NEILL
As evidenced by our friends here.
[Indicating SG-3.]
GARSHAW
It is our wish that your lack of return will convince them that we
are Goa'uld and not Tok'ra.
DANIEL
You want them to think that we're dead.
O'NEILL
Well that kinda sucks.
GARSHAW
I'm sorry. We will try to make you as comfortable as possible.
