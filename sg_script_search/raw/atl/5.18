TEASER
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, EAST PIER, LEVEL FOUR
[A woman wearing a medical striped Atlantis uniform looks confusedly
around. She hears voices approaching and is startled, ducking into a
nearby room.]
INT--AUXILIARY LAB, EAST PIER
[She stares blankly around at the computer equipment and schematics.
Zelenka enters, carrying a tray of food.]
ZELENKA
Oh. I didn't know anybody was in here. Huh.
[The woman, Neeva, makes a nervous noncommittal sound.]
ZELENKA
Are you looking for, um, Rodney? 'Cause I saw him in the mess hall.
NEEVA
(blankly)
Rodney?
ZELENKA
Yup. Are you all right?
NEEVA
Yeah.
ZELENKA
You just seem a little...confused.
[He starts to work at a computer, then notices her nervous fidgeting
and wary glances. He approaches her.]
ZELENKA
(concerned)
Are you ill?
NEEVA
No. No, no, no, I just...I don't...where am I?
ZELENKA
You're in one of our auxiliary labs...East Pier, Level Four?
[She just looks scared and continues to fidget.]
ZELENKA
(solicitous)
Here. Wh-why don't you sit down?
NEEVA
It's okay.
ZELENKA
No, really. I mean, I'll radio Rodney and I'll just...
NEEVA
(quickly)
No, no. You don't need to do that.
ZELENKA
(soothingly)
Better yet, let...why don't you lie down? Walk with me to the
infirmary and...they'll examine you. They'll just see if there's
anything....
[Zelenka takes her gently by the arm and while she nods he starts to
lead her away. She grabs a pair of pliers on a shelf as they pass and
stabs Zelenka in his lower right abdomen. He gasps in pain and
collapses.]
[Neeva, gets a glimpse of herself in a mirror on the wall. The
reflection is Keller's. She touches her face, studying her altered
appearance in confusion before leaving the lab. Zelenka makes a
croaking noise as he lies half-unconscious on the floor, bleeding.]

OPENING CREDITS
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Neeva walks around the crowded corridor, trying not to catch anyone's
eye.]
EXT--ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY
[She stares around, watching a puddle jumper fly by. She takes the
bloody pliers out from where she has it hidden up her sleeve and drops
it over the balcony side. She starts to head back in, but her
reflection in the glass window stops her. She stares, frightened, at
Keller looking back at her. McKay comes up behind her, startling her
when he speaks.]
MCKAY
There you are. I've been looking all over for you. What, is your
radio not working? I called like a thousand times!
NEEVA
Um...I--
MCKAY
All right, here...
[He reaches for her ear, and she instinctively grabs his arm in a
defensive movement.]
MCKAY
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just want to check your earwig. Here
we go.
[She lets him continue, and he gently pulls off her radio earpiece.]
MCKAY
There we go. It's probably just a dead battery. Come on, it's
schnitzel day. We've got to hurry though, 'cause it's going fast.
[She follows him back out of the balcony.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
MCKAY
So what happened?
NEEVA
What do you mean?
MCKAY
Well, hello? Our lunch date? You were supposed to meet me like, half
an hour ago.
NEEVA
I must've forgotten.
[He stops walking, and she follows suit.]
MCKAY
Hey. What's wrong? You seem distracted. Is something bothering you?
NEEVA
No--
MCKAY
(interrupting)
Did I do something? Oh, I did, didn't I? What did I do?
NEEVA
Nothing. I'm just...I'm not...
[The earpiece in McKay's hand activates, the tinny voice audible to
them both.]
MARIE
(frantic, over radio)
Doctor Keller? Doctor Keller, please respond!
[McKay purses his lips, piqued, and swings the earpiece before raising
the microphone to his mouth.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
Just a second.
(handing radio to Neeva)
It's for you. Working fine, apparently.
[Neeva struggles for a moment, figuring out how to put the radio back
on.]
NEEVA
Uh...hello?
MARIE
(over radio)
Doctor Keller, we have an emergency! Doctor Zelenka has been
seriously injured!
NEEVA
Doctor Zelenka?
MCKAY
(impatiently activating his own radio)
What's wrong with Zelenka? Is he complaining about another one of
his so-called migraines? 'Cause if he is, you can send him right
down to the--
MARIE
(interrupting, over radio)
He's been stabbed!
MCKAY
What, stabbed? What do you mean stabbed? Like, with a knife stabbed?
By who?
[Neeva nervously looks behind her to see if there's a way to escape but
an armed German security member is taking a patrol position there.]
MARIE
(over intercom)
I don't know. An S.O. just radioed us. They found him on the floor
of his lab. He's unconscious, losing a lot of blood. They're rushing
him to the infirmary.
MCKAY
All right, we're on our way!
[McKay rushes off. Neeva nervously follows.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Marie and others work on Zelenka. McKay and Neeva enter. They're met
by Marie.]
MARIE
His pressure's dropping, sixty over forty. Pulse rapid, skin
diaphoretic. The scan shows internal bleeding, laceration of the
liver.
MCKAY
(worried)
So...so what? Is he going to die?
MARIE
He needs immediate surgery. He's in hypovolemic shock.
[Neeva stares at the staff working on the man she stabbed, seeing he's
unconscious and pale.]
MARIE
(prompting)
Doctor?
NEEVA
Yes. Yes. He needs surgery.
MARIE
We're prepping the O.R. Doctor McBride will assist you. He's already
scrubbing. We'll be all set to go as soon as you're ready.
[Neeva starts to hyperventilate.]
MCKAY
(sounding like from a distance)
Jennifer.
MCKAY
(loudly)
Jennifer!
[Neeva snaps out of it, looking at McKay.]
MCKAY
You're acting weird. What's wrong with you?
NEEVA
Nothing. Nothing. I need to get ready.
[She walks away, Marie leading her to the scrub room.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD
[Marie and the rest of the surgical staff are all in scrubs and ready
to start. McKay watches from observation. Neeva nervously comes over to
the operating table. Marie hands the scalpel to her. Neeva stares at a
monitor recording the surgery, seeing Keller on the video screen where
she is standing.]
MARIE
(concerned)
Doctor?
[Neeva takes a shaky breath, then lowers her face mask.]
NEEVA
I'm not feeling very well. Take over for me. I'm going to go lay
down.
[Everyone looks at each other, confused, as Neeva walks away.]
INT--WOOLSEY'S OFFICE
[Woolsey sits at his desk, looking at his laptop. Sheppard and McKay
enter.]
WOOLSEY
How'd it go?
MCKAY
They've managed to stop the bleeding, but he's lost a lot of blood.
WOOLSEY
Is he awake yet?
SHEPPARD
No, he's in a coma.
MCKAY
It's a light coma. I mean, they figure he should recover, barring
any, you know, complications.
WOOLSEY
(puzzled)
I hear Doctor Keller didn't perform the surgery.
MCKAY
No. No, she...excused herself--said she wasn't feeling well.
WOOLSEY
What's wrong with her?
MCKAY
Well, you got me. I mean she's been acting strange all day--aloof,
distracted. I found her wandering Atlantis looking lost. You know, I
got her to the infirmary, but she just stood there like she'd never
held a scalpel before.
[Woolsey stiffens in his chair, alert, then shifts.]
WOOLSEY
Where is she now?
MCKAY
She's in her quarters, resting.
WOOLSEY
Doctor Beckett is due back soon. I'll have him examine her for any
possible contagion or, God forbid, another one of those parasitic
organisms. Better safe than sorry. Any leads yet as to who might
have done this to Doctor Zelenka?
SHEPPARD
No witnesses. No sign of a struggle.
WOOLSEY
I want a full investigation. Use every resource, no stone unturned.
One of our people is lying in a coma...
MCKAY
(quietly)
Light coma.
[He stammers into silence.]
WOOLSEY
...and I want to know who's responsible.
INT--KELLER'S QUARTERS
[Neeva rummages through Keller's personal belongings. She finds a
graduation picture of Keller and her father. She stares at it, then at
the full length mirror in the room at Keller's reflection of her.]
NEEVA
(low, to herself)
What the hell's going on here?
[The door opens behind her, Ronon leaning in the doorway.]
RONON
Hey. Heard you weren't feeling well.
NEEVA
No.
[There is an awkward silence.]
RONON
Can I come in?
NEEVA
(reluctantly)
All right.
RONON
So. What's wrong with you?
NEEVA
I don't know. I'm just...tired?
RONON
(nodding, but suspicious)
Been pushing yourself real hard lately.
NEEVA
Yes. Well, uh, you know me. I'm always pushing myself real hard.
[She shoots him a nervous smile. Ronon studies her.]
NEEVA
(defensively)
What?
RONON
(smiling falsely)
Nothing.
NEEVA
Anyway, I'll be fine. I just need to--
MCKAY
(stiffly)
Hi.
[They turn to see McKay in the still open doorway.]
MCKAY
Am I...interrupting?
NEEVA
No.
[McKay enters, pleased. Ronon sighs.]
MCKAY
Good. I mean um...I just dropped by to let you know that
uh...Beckett is on his way back. He'll be able to fill in for you
while you're, um...ill.
[He continues to shoot glances between Ronon and Neeva as he stands
beside Ronon.]
NEEVA
Great.
MCKAY
Yeah, we've, uh, sent a puddle jumper for him.
NEEVA
(blankly)
A puddle jumper?
MCKAY
(dismissively)
Well, he's in some remote desert village. It'll take too long to
walk back to the 'gate, so it's easier to, you know, just hitch a
ride.
NEEVA
(parroting)
A ride on a puddle jumper.
[Ronon stares at Neeva, almost with hostility.]
MCKAY
(puzzled at her reaction)
Yeah.
[McKay and Ronon exchange looks.]
MCKAY
Maybe we should leave. You know, let her get some rest.
RONON
Yeah.
[Neeva smiles. Ronon leaves first. McKay lingers.]
MCKAY
Call me...if you need anything.
NEEVA
I will.
[McKay leaves, and the doors close.]
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Neeva lies on the scanner bed as it runs its test. Beckett stands
nearby with McKay and Woolsey. As the scan finishes, Neeva sits up.]
BECKETT
Nothing out of the usual. No sign of trauma or any kind of organism.
WOOLSEY
What about her blood work?
BECKETT
The same.
(to Neeva)
How long have you been feeling like this?
NEEVA
Um...a day or so?
BECKETT
Have you been sleeping all right?
NEEVA
No. I've been pushing myself real hard.
BECKETT
Aye. Well, I'd like to keep you overnight for observation. I'll give
you something to help you sleep, and we'll monitor your condition.
Then hopefully you'll wake up in the morning refreshed--back to your
old self, okay?
[He smiles at her and pats her on the leg, then steps away.]
WOOLSEY
You're certain you saw nothing at all.
BECKETT
She's fine...
[He lowers his voice as they step into a storage area of the infirmary
with McKay.]
BECKETT
...physically speaking. If there's something wrong with her, I'm
afraid it's most likely psychological in nature.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
[Neeva lies on a bed wearing hospital scrubs. A staff member walks by.
When the coast is clear, Neeva sneaks out of bed, pulls open a drawer
and grabs her clothes.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Neeva is still pulling on her jacket as she spots a technician working
at a junction console.]
NEEVA
(with charming smile)
Hello. All these corridors, I keep getting turned around. The puddle
jumper is...where?
TECHNICIAN
The jumper bay.
NEEVA
Yes.
TECHNICIAN
Top of the central tower.
NEEVA
Right. Yeah. I know that. I just need to, um...how do I...?
TECHNICIAN
Oh. The transporter's at the end of the corridor. it'll take you
there.
NEEVA
Transporter. Of course. Thank you!
TECHNICIAN
You're welcome.
INT--JUMPER BAY
[Neeva exits a transporter directly into the jumper bay, seeing several
parked jumpers.]
NEEVA
Hmm.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[She enters one parked jumper and sorts through cases sitting on the
cargo bay benches.]
NEEVA
Ah...perfect.
[She tucks a pistol into the small of her back and heads to the pilot
seat. She sits and starts trying to press the DHD symbols or start the
jumper, but the ship stays powered down.]
NEEVA
Come on, come on, come on.
MCKAY
What are you doing?
[She spins to find McKay has walked up behind her.]
NEEVA
I...couldn't sleep.
MCKAY
What, so you...came up to the jumper bay?
NEEVA
(casually)
Yeah...I thought I'd go for a ride...heh.
MCKAY
In a puddle jumper?
NEEVA
Is there a problem with that?
MCKAY
A few. For starters, you don't have the Ancient gene, so you can't
fly one, but you already know that.
NEEVA
Can you fly it?
MCKAY
Of course I can. That's not the point. Look, you should be back in
the infirmary.
[Neeva quickly stands and gets close to McKay.]
NEEVA
But you could take me for a ride.
MCKAY
(surprised)
What, now?
NEEVA
(coy)
Yeah, it'll really help me relax.
MCKAY
Well, I thought Beckett gave you pills for that.
NEEVA
(with frustrated sigh)
They didn't work.
MCKAY
(sympathetic)
Oh.
[Neeva stands nose to nose with McKay, running her hands up and down
him.]
NEEVA
(sultry)
Yeah. Come on. Please? Just you and me...alone. Oh, you could take
me somewhere secluded. We can...we could make love underneath the
stars.
MCKAY
Really?
NEEVA
Would you like that?
MCKAY
Well...yeah! I mean, I'd have to get a blanket though, because the
mainland's groundcover is loaded with allergens.
NEEVA
No. Let's just go now.
MCKAY
(stepping away from her)
Wait. W-w-w-wait. No, no, no, no, no. Look, you look. You should go
back to the infirmary.
[She steps into his space and begins touching him again.]
NEEVA
(insistently)
Forget about the infirmary. I need to be with you.
MCKAY
(self-conscious)
Jennifer, please.
NEEVA
Come on. I mean, just a quick ride. Don't you want to be with me?
MCKAY
No, no, yeah, I don't...no...yes! Just...I...will you stop! Look, I
don't know what is wrong with you, but you are clearly not yourself.
I'm taking you back to the infirmary.
[He reaches for her arm.]
NEEVA
No.
MCKAY
Well, you can argue all you want, I'm not letting you--
[McKay reaches for her, but she slaps his hand away and pushes him.]
NEEVA
(through gritted teeth, angry)
You're not taking me anywhere!
MCKAY
(firmly)
Jennifer...now I need you to listen to me. As soon as you are cured
of whatever it is that is affecting you, you're going to thank me
for this. So, let's go.
NEEVA
No! Don't you--!
[McKay grabs her arm but she twists out of his grasp and pulls out her
gun, pointing it at him.]
MCKAY
(horrified)
What're you doing?
NEEVA
(coldly)
You should've taken me on that ride.
[She primes the pistol, but before she can fire Ronon arrives and
shoots her with a stun blast. Ronon and McKay exchange disturbed
looks.]
INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM
[Woolsey, Sheppard's team, and Beckett all stare down at Neeva, who is
strapped to the bed.]
WOOLSEY
I don't care what the scans say. Either she suffered a serious,
mind-altering brain trauma, or some kind of entity has taken control
of her.
TEYLA
Has she been injured recently?
MCKAY
Not that I know of. I mean, she was perfectly fine up until
yesterday.
BECKETT
I'm telling you, her brain scan would've revealed any kind of
physical trauma as well as any foreign organism.
RONON
Unless the organism's good at hiding.
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Wouldn't be the first time. It took days to figure out Rodney
was infected.
BECKETT
I still don't think that we should rule out the possibility of a
psychological event. We sometimes forget that working in this
environment in a whole other galaxy can be emotionally overwhelming.
Such acute stress has often been linked to various dissociative
disorders.
MCKAY
Disorders? She tried to kill me!
BECKETT
(skeptical)
Ach, Rodney. I don't think she would've pulled the trigger.
MCKAY
(insistent)
Hey, I saw the look in her eye. She...wait a second. What if she had
something to do with Zelenka? What if she's the one who stabbed him?
TEYLA
(dubious)
Doctor Keller?
RONON
The woman down there is not Jennifer Keller. I think Woolsey's
right. Something has taken control of her.
TEYLA
Well, how can we be sure of this?
SHEPPARD
Well, we can start by asking her.
[They all step away from the window.]
INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION ROOM
[Everyone but Ronon and Teyla enter. Neeva watches, then looks away.]
SHEPPARD
Let's make this simple. Who the hell are you?
NEEVA
(nonplussed)
What?
WOOLSEY
If you are, in fact, Jennifer Keller, you would know what town
you're from, what your father's name is...so go ahead, tell us.
NEEVA
All right, look. I know I've been acting strange--
MCKAY
(peeved)
Strange?! Doctor Keller wouldn't point a gun at me. And she
certainly wouldn't stab Zelenka.
[Neeva licks her lips nervously but says nothing.]
SHEPPARD
Well?
[She gulps, but doesn't deny it.]
WOOLSEY
You did it, didn't you? You stabbed him.
[She looks at all of them.]
NEEVA
(defensively)
It was self-defense. I didn't want to hurt anybody, but he attacked
me.
SHEPPARD
(incredulous)
Zelenka attacked you?
BECKETT
(scoffing)
He couldn't harm a fly.
NEEVA
(vulnerable)
He tried to grab me. I thought he was going to turn me in. I was
afraid of being caught.
WOOLSEY
The fact of the matter is, you have been caught. So I would advise
you to tell us exactly who...or what you are.
[Neeva takes a deep breath, steeling herself.]
NEEVA
My name is Neeva Casol. I have no idea what I'm doing here or how I
came to be in this person's body.
[Everyone exchanges looks.]
BECKETT
(dubious)
In her body?
NEEVA
Yes. One moment, I was myself, searching through some artifacts in a
village. The next moment, I'm stuck in some strange woman's body,
standing in the middle of this city. Every time I look at my
reflection, I see her...staring back at me.
[In the observation window, Ronon and Teyla exchange looks. Neeva
stares at a monitor recording her, looking at the image of Keller
strapped in the bed.]
BECKETT
How is that even possible?
NEEVA
I wish I knew.
MCKAY
What artifacts?
NEEVA
Me and my associates, we travel around, planet to planet, searching
for valuables to acquire.
SHEPPARD
Oh, you mean "steal".
NEEVA
(ignoring the jibe)
We heard about a planet that supposedly held a trove of Ancestral
artifacts, so we made our way there and broke into the vault.
FLASHBACK
INT--VILLAGE VAULT
[Jannick, Bordal, and Neeva climb through a window where they've
removed the bottom half of the bars. They all carry large empty sacks.]
JANNICK
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BORDAL
You see? I told you. There is all kinds of treasure in here.
NEEVA
Okay, well move fast. We'll take only what we can carry.
[They begin to scavenge valuables. Neeva takes a cloth off one display.
It is an Ancient communications terminal, such as seen in 9.02 "Avalon
Part 2". Jannick walks over as Neeva studies it.]
JANNICK
What...is that?
NEEVA
I don't know.
JANNICK
Whoa.
NEEVA
But it's too big to haul out of here.
[She turns away from the device and goes to the next table, which has a
long box. She opens the box and finds four oblong objects...the Ancient
communication stones, nestled inside. She picks up one, and notices the
receptacles on the device behind her fit the size of the stones. She
presses one into in a spot. The terminal's central crystal glows.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, EAST PIER
[Neeva stands in the corridor where she appeared at the beginning of
the episode.]
NEEVA
(voiceover)
I have no idea how this happened or why.
END FLASHBACK
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY ISOLATION WARD
NEEVA
(sighing)
Oh, believe me, I 'm just as confused by it as you are. But I am
telling you the truth.
[The men exchange wary looks.]
NEEVA
Look, I'm sorry for hurting one of your people, but I felt
threatened, and I only know of one way to deal with a threat. I
don't want to hurt anybody else, I just...I just want to get back
into my own body.
[She again stares at the video image of Keller.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[Sheppard, Beckett, and Woolsey enter McKay's lab, where he's already
sitting by a computer.]
WOOLSEY
What've you got?
MCKAY
Well, I think I figured out what happened. The artifact that that
woman described? It rang a bell, so I did a little research. Turns
out, a few years ago, SG-1 encountered a similar device in the
Glastonbury cavern.
WOOLSEY
The Ancient communication terminal?
MCKAY
Exactly!
WOOLSEY
Of course. The stones, the psychic link.
SHEPPARD
Wh-wh-what. What terminal? What stones?
MCKAY
Okay, look. SG-1 discovered an Ancient device. There were these
stones, and if you place them in one of several recesses around the
outside of the device, it activates it, and allows you to connect
with someone far, far away--across the galaxy, inter-galactically
even, as was the case with Daniel Jackson and Vala.
BECKETT
(concerned)
So this woman activated one of these devices.
MCKAY
I think so, yes.
SHEPPARD
Why'd she connect with Keller?
MCKAY
Ah, my first question as well. Then I remembered Janus's lab....
FLASHBACK
INT--JANUS'S LAB
MCKAY
(voiceover)
We have recovered tons of Ancient technology from there. And we're
still in the process of cataloging it all. Anyways, a few weeks ago?
Jennifer visited me while I was working there.
[McKay runs cables and works while Keller sits bored, waiting.]
KELLER
(whining)
Rodney, if we don't leave soon, we're not going to get a good seat!
MCKAY
Yeah, almost, almost there.
KELLER
Come on, it's Dr. No! The first Bond movie! You don't want to get
stuck sitting behind Ronon again, like last week.
MCKAY
I know. I know. I know.
KELLER
(muttering)
Not to mention all the popcorn's going to be gone.
[While McKay rambles, Keller distractedly glances around. She opens a
box that has two communication stones nestled inside. She picks up
one.]
MCKAY
(distracted by work)
God, this is amazing! These are the initial design concepts for a
personal cloaking device. I mean, Janus never got around to actually
making it. But I think, you know given enough time, I might be able
to actually...
(notices what she's doing, and stutters, panicked)
Hey! D-d-d-d-! We haven't cataloged those yet!
[Chastised, Keller drops the stone back into the box.]
KELLER
Sorry.
MCKAY
(scolding)
What did we say about that?
END FLASHBACK
INT--MCKAY'S LAB
[McKay shows the others the stones in the box.]
MCKAY
These stones must somehow be connected to the Ancient terminal that
woman Neeva found.
BECKETT
But how could Jennifer activate one of these stones?
WOOLSEY
He's right. It's Ancient technology. Don't you need to have the ATA
gene?
MCKAY
Well, it must've been initialized already. Maybe Janus did it
thousands of years ago or maybe a tech initialized it after we
discovered the lab. Look, the point is that Jennifer was obviously
the last person to touch this, which is why it connected to her.
WOOLSEY
If I remember the case report correctly, disconnecting the device
proved difficult.
MCKAY
(concerned)
Yes. I've been going over the SGC files on that, and there's still a
lot of unanswered questions about how it works.
SHEPPARD
Hold on. If this woman's mind is in Keller's body, does that
mean...Keller's mind is in her body?
MCKAY
I don't know. Maybe. I mean...probably.
WOOLSEY
Then the question is...where is Doctor Keller?
INT--JAIL CELL
[Keller is in a jail cell, in Neeva's dress. She stares at a faded
mirror--Neeva's reflection is inside. The magistrate and some guards
approach.]
KELLER
What happened? Did you contact Atlantis?
MAGISTRATE
No.
KELLER
Why not?
MAGISTRATE
I chose to first contact a few of my trading partners on other
planets. It appears you and your accomplices have made quite the
name for yourselves.
KELLER
(desperately)
I already told you. I am not who you think I am.
MAGISTRATE
I suppose I should feel fortunate. I mean, your crimes elsewhere far
exceed the mere robbery charges you've been accused of here. I've
counted no less than five murders committed on other planets by your
hand alone--several more with the aid of your two accomplices. Well,
they may have eluded capture so far, but mark my words, we will find
them.
[Keller looks horrified by this news.]
KELLER
(voice shaking with emotion)
Listen to me, my name is Doctor Jennifer Keller. I am the Chief
Medical Officer from Atlantis. I don't know what's going on or how
my mind ended up in this woman's body, but if you contact them, ask
for Doctor Rodney McKay--
MAGISTRATE
(cutting her off)
You are also said to be a highly effective liar. Willing to
fabricate any story, broker any kind of deal to get yourself free.
Rest assured, I will not fall for your tricks. As magistrate of this
village, I hereby pronounce sentence upon you for the crimes you
have committed not only on this planet, but on all the other planets
in the coalition. Tomorrow you shall be taken from this cell...and
executed.
[Keller is stunned, gasping in horror as he leaves.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Sheppard's team, Beckett, and Woolsey sit around the table.]
WOOLSEY
What are the options?
MCKAY
There is only one option!
SHEPPARD
We have to go to the planet, find the communications terminal, and
shut it off.
MCKAY
It was activated on that end, it's the initial transmitter. The only
way to sever the connection is to shut it down at the source.
WOOLSEY
And have you figured out how to safely do that?
MCKAY
(reluctantly)
No, not yet.
SHEPPARD
We're not going to know until we get a good look at this thing.
BECKETT
Well, the sooner the better. I've been studying the SG-1 report. The
device connects beyond merely the psychological. There's also a
physiological connection as well.
TEYLA
(worried)
What does that mean?
BECKETT
It means...should Neeva's body be killed, Jennifer's mind would
perish along with her.
MCKAY
(disgusted)
And we'll be stuck with this...other woman in Keller's body?
RONON
We need to get moving.
WOOLSEY
Agreed. Do we know which planet this device is on?
SHEPPARD
We will.
INT--INFIRMARY ISOLATION WARD
[Sheppard and McKay talk to Neeva.]
NEEVA
I would be happy to take you to the planet. I'll lead you straight
to the device, on one condition.
MCKAY
Heh, you're in no position to make any demands--
SHEPPARD
What is it?
MCKAY
(weakly)
--young lady.
SHEPPARD
When you sever that connection, you have to agree not to pursue me
or my accomplices.
[McKay scoffs.]
SHEPPARD
(stiffly)
Fine.
NEEVA
And I want you to give me one of those puddle jumpers.
MCKAY
What?! Forget it!
NEEVA
Why not? I've been out there. I know how many you have. You have
more than enough.
SHEPPARD
Well, you're not get anything.
NEEVA
Weapons, then.
SHEPPARD
You take us to the planet; we agree not to pursue you. That's it.
Take it or leave it.
NEEVA
(sighing)
All right, all right. Let's go.
WORMHOLE EFFECT
EXT--PLANET STARGATE, DAY
[Sheppard's team, Beckett, and Neeva exit the wormhole.]
SHEPPARD
Which way?
NEEVA
This way. It's not far. A few hours' walk.
MCKAY
(protesting)
A few hours?! You could've told us that before!
SHEPPARD
Wouldn't have made any difference, Rodney. We can't get a jumper in
this forest.
TEYLA
And the Daedalus is back on Earth.
MCKAY
Yeah, but I could've packed some extra power bars, some water, not
to mention proper insoles.
NEEVA
He complains a lot.
SHEPPARD
Only when he's awake.
NEEVA
Is it true that Doctor Keller and he are...?
SHEPPARD
Hard to believe, huh?
[Neeva glances back at McKay.]
MCKAY
(annoyed)
Yeah, keep walking!
INT--JAIL CELL
[Keller sits on her small cot. The magistrate arrives.]
MAGISTRATE
It's time.
[Guards approach and pull Keller out of her cell.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[The team arrive at the outskirts of the village.]
NEEVA
That's it. The vault containing the artifacts is near the center of
the village, so we'll have to be quiet. Maybe only a few of us
should go in? And I'm going to need a weapon in case we run into
some--
SHEPPARD
No. We're not breaking into the room.
NEEVA
What?
SHEPPARD
We're just going to go talk to these people and ask them for help.
NEEVA
Oh, they're not going to help us. I tried to rob them.
MCKAY
They won't know you. You're in Jennifer Keller's body, remember?
TEYLA
If you do not say anything, it should not be a problem.
NEEVA
Okay, but what if they've captured her...me? Once we sever the
connection, what's to stop them from keeping me locked up?
SHEPPARD
(unconcerned)
Umm...nothing.
NEEVA
Ahh, nothing.
SHEPPARD
You said we couldn't pursue you, you didn't say anything about them.
NEEVA
So you tricked me.
SHEPPARD
Hey, just take it easy.
NEEVA
I...listen, I am not going to let you disarm this device without
first knowing where my body is.
MCKAY
You don't have a choice.
BECKETT
We're wasting valuable time here, people!
RONON
(indicating Neeva)
Maybe she should stay here.
NEEVA
(peeved)
No...I'll go.
SHEPPARD
Ronon...?
RONON
Yeah, I got her.
SHEPPARD
Let's go.
[They head out, Ronon near Neeva.]
INT--VILLAGE STORE
[The team enters a small store where a woman and young man stand behind
the till.]
SHEPPARD
Hi. It's okay, we're friends. We're, uh, we're from Atlantis. I'm
Colonel John Sheppard.
WOMAN
(primly)
What is it you want?
SHEPPARD
Well, we have a problem, and we need some help.
MCKAY
We hear that this village holds a number of Ancient artifacts, most
notably a communication terminal about yay big, roundish...
(he slows his words as he sees the couple's wary looks)
...grooves along the outside? Yes?
WOMAN
Why do you ask about this device?
SHEPPARD
So you have it. Where is it?
WOMAN
It's hidden...and well protected. So if you have any designs on
removing it--
MCKAY
No, no, no, no, no. Look, we just want to take a look at it. This
may sound strange, but we think it may have been inadvertently
activated, and it's...well, it's causing some problems for us on
Atlantis.
SHEPPARD
Long story short, we're just going to shut it off, and...well, we'll
be on our way.
BECKETT
We're not here to cause any trouble. We'd just like...some
assistance.
WOMAN
I do not have the authority to grant such assistance. For that, you
will need to speak to the village magistrate.
SHEPPARD
All right, let's um, let's talk to him.
WOMAN
He's not here.
MCKAY
(muttering to himself)
Oh, for god's sake.
SHEPPARD
How long is he going to be gone? This is urgent!
WOMAN
He will return when the execution is completed.
[The team look at her with dawning horror.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Keller is marched between two guards, her hands tied behind her back.
In the distance she sees more guards, the magistrate, and a hooded
executioner waiting with a big axe near a stump. She balks.]
KELLER
Oh...oh...oh my God!
[In another part of the forest, the team run through the woods.]
EXT--EXECUTION SITE
[Keller is forced to kneel before the stump.]
MAGISTRATE
Neeva Casol...you have been found guilty of the crime of murder, and
so you shall be put to death.
KELLER
(desperately)
I am not Neeva Casol!
EXT--FOREST, DAY
EXT--EXECUTION SITE, DAY
[Keller shakes her head in desperation. She's forced to lean over the
stump.]
MAGISTRATE
Don't worry. The executioner's blade is strong, his blade sharp.
Your death will be far less painful than those of your victims.
KELLER
(tearfully)
Please. Please, don't do this!
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[The team continues to run through the woods.]
EXT--EXECUTION SITE, DAY
[The executioner looks through the one patch to the magistrate, who
nods. He touches his blade to Keller's neck, then raises it. He is shot
in the chest.]
MAGISTRATE
Ambush!
[The guards and magistrate spread out, trying to pinpoint the gunfire,
and raising their own guns. Keller takes the opportunity to run away.
She runs into the forest, her hands still tied behind her. Keller trips
over a branch. She gets back to her feet to find herself confronted by
two men, Neeva's accomplices. Jannick approaches, flicking a dagger in
his hand. She stands nervously as he comes closer. He reaches behind
and cuts her hands free. She stares at him, nonplussed.]
JANNICK
What? No "thank you" for the rescue? Let's go.
[On the opposite side, the Atlantis team is just reaching the general
area. They stop as they hear yelling ahead, pausing to listen.]
MAGISTRATE
(yelling out)
She went that way! Find her! Go back to the village! Gather more
men! I want that ancestral ring guarded! No one leaves this planet!
NEEVA
(to team)
We're too late.
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[The team cautiously moves through the woods.]
MCKAY
I don't believe this. How did she escape?
NEEVA
My accomplices no doubt intervened. This is not the first time we've
been in this situation.
BECKETT
How many accomplices do you have?
NEEVA
Two.
RONON
(incredulous)
That's all?
NEEVA
That's more than enough, trust me. You don't want to challenge them.
RONON
Yeah? We'll see about that.
TEYLA
Where would they have gone?
NEEVA
(sighing innocently)
I have no idea.
SHEPPARD
All right, Chewie, start tracking.
RONON
Yeah, I'm on it.
INT--CAVE
[Bordal, Jannick, and Keller enter the cave where they've camped out.
The two men make themselves comfortable while Keller nervously stands
against the wall near the entrance]
JANNICK
You looked frightened out there. What, you didn't think we'd save
you?
KELLER
(stammering)
What? Di-no. I just--
BORDAL
After how many times you saved our hides? We weren't going to let
you down.
JANNICK
You all right? You look confused.
KELLER
(gulping)
No, I'm just...you know, happy to be out of there.
BORDAL
So what's the plan?
KELLER
(blankly)
Plan?
JANNICK
Yeah. What do we do now?
KELLER
Uh...I don't know...
[Bordal and Jannick exchange wary looks. Keller notices their
reaction.]
KELLER
...yet. Yet! I don't know yet. I--I just need...more time...to
think!
JANNICK
Well, think faster. Because sooner or later, those villagers are
going to find this cave. And I don't want to be here when they do.
KELLER
Right. Good point.
EXT--FOREST, DAY
RONON
This way.
[They pause as they spot villagers patrolling nearby.]
BECKETT
That's the third patrol in the last ten minutes.
TEYLA
It seems as if the entire village is out looking for her.
MCKAY
(rueful)
Let's hope we find her before they do.
[Neeva notices all their attention is on the villagers, and makes a
break for it.]
MCKAY
Hey! Hey!
[Neeva races through the woods, Ronon taking the lead of the pursuit
behind her. He pulls up short in an empty area.]
SHEPPARD
What the hell happened?
RONON
(frustrated)
I lost her.
TEYLA
Are there no tracks?
RONON
There's nothing! She's good.
INT--CAVE
KELLER
Listen, I think the best plan of action is to leave this planet.
Now, I know of another planet. We'll be safe there.
JANNICK
They'll be guarding the ring.
KELLER
I know. Maybe we could create some kind of diversion?
BORDAL
Well, how do we do that?
KELLER
I-I don't know. Um...Maybe...maybe we could we set an explosion.
JANNICK
And why would they run toward an explosion?
KELLER
(brightly)
Or something else?
JANNICK
I say we wait 'till nightfall...then we'll launch an attack on the
ring. Catch them by surprise.
KELLER
(biting her thumb nervously)
Uh, an attack?
JANNICK
We'll kill the guards, activate the ring, and we make our escape.
KELLER
Um...
BORDAL
I agree.
KELLER
Okay...uh, but if I think of something else before then, maybe we
could...
[Bordal and Jannick raise their pistols and cock them. Keller raises
her hands. Neeva enters the cave, her hands raised. Keller looks at
Neeva in shock.]
NEEVA
All right, don't shoot.
JANNICK
Who...are...you?
[Neeva is distracted by looking at Keller.]
NEEVA
I'm...Neeva Casol. All right, let me explain. Back at the artifact
vault, I accidentally activated some kind of Ancestral
communications device that caused my mind to transfer into this
woman's body and hers into mine.
[Keller expression changes from bemusement to understanding.]
JANNICK
You expect us to believe that?
NEEVA
Yeah, Jannick I do. I expect you to believe that, just as you did on
Vara Sol when I brokered that deal with the fish merchant to save
your life? And you, Bordal. If you didn't trust me back when you got
caught at that brothel, those women would've made sure the thought
of procreating never again entered your mind.
BORDAL
How do you know about that?
NEEVA
Because I'm Neeva! There's a link between this woman and me. Her
mind is in my body, and mine is in hers.
KELLER
Look, whatever's happening here, I had nothing to do with it.
NEEVA
No, she didn't, but if we're going to fix this, we need to move
fast. We need to go back to the village, break into the vault, and
turn off that device. We need to be really careful, because not only
are the villagers out looking for us, but so are the people from
Atlantis.
KELLER
W-w-wait a second, they're here?! Who? Colonel Sheppard?
NEEVA
Among others. But they're going to turn us into the villagers if
they catch us, so we need no problems from you. Do you understand
me?
[She glares at Keller threateningly. Keller nervously nods.]
NEEVA
All right, we need to find this device...
[Jannick brandishes his gun.]
JANNICK
Stop! I don't know what's going on here.
NEEVA
I just told you, all right. I am Neeva.
JANNICK
I've never seen you before!
NEEVA
(frustrated)
Jannick, listen to me. This is not the time to be stupid!
KELLER
Uh, I wouldn't make him angry...
NEEVA
You're going to put down the gun, and you're going to listen to what
I say.
JANNICK
No. I'm not. I'm going to take the both of you with me. We're going
to attack the ring now. And we'll sort out who's really who on
another planet. And if you're lying to me, you're as good as dead.
[Neeva glares as Keller nervously looks from one to the other.]
EXT--FORREST
[The four walk toward the gate.]
NEEVA
This Doctor McKay...?
KELLER
What about him?
NEEVA
You can do better.
JANNICK
Be quiet.
NEEVA
Jannick, I know this is difficult to understand, and I was equally
confused by it at the beginning, but you have to...
[Gunfire just misses them and they dive for cover near a tree and
stump. Jannick and Bordal blindly return fire.]
JANNICK
How many?
BORDAL
I don't know.
NEEVA
I count four!
NEEVA
We'd be a lot better off if you could give us weapons.
[Bordal rises to shoot, but is downed by a gun blast. Both Neeva and
Keller reach for him. Keller sees the wound and checks his pulse.]
KELLER
He's dead.
[Neeva looks stricken by the news. Jannick fires back.]
[In the distance, the Atlantis team hears the firefight and runs
towards it.]
[While Jannick is distracted, Keller runs away.]
JANNICK
Hey! Come back here! Stop!
[Jannick aims at Keller.]
NEEVA
Jannick, no! Don't!
[Neeva jumps up to pull down his arm. She's shot in the gut by one of
the soldiers. Jannick too is wounded, but runs away. One soldier runs
after Jannick, the other reloads as Neeva writhes in pain. He aims his
shotgun, and Neeva wriggles to get away. The soldier is stunned by
Ronon's pistol and the team arrives as Neeva collapses.]
MCKAY
Is she going to be all right?
BECKETT
Aye, for now, but I need to stop the bleeding. Here, hold her
steady, Rodney.
[McKay grasps Neeva by the shoulders as Neeva winces in pain and
Beckett begins to treat the wound.]
INT--VILLAGE STORE
[The magistrate has joined the woman store owner and they look over
some papers. The Atlantis team bursts in, McKay carrying Neeva. Teyla
and Beckett shove some items off a table.]
BECKETT
(to villagers)
You two, give us a hand here, please.
(to Ronon)
On the table, Ronon.
[Ronon lays Neeva on the table.]
WOMAN
(to magistrate)
These are the people from Atlantis I was telling you about.
MAGISTRATE
What happened?
SHEPPARD
(angrily)
She was shot by one of your men.
WOMAN
I warned you it was dangerous to venture out there.
[Sheppard glares.]
MAGISTRATE
What, is she dead?
BECKETT
No, but she's badly wounded. Teyla, I'm going to need a hand, here.
We need to remove the bullet and stop the bleeding.
[Teyla nods.]
MCKAY
And we need access to that communication terminal. We need to shut
it down right now!
MAGISTRATE
Why, what's it doing?
MCKAY
Well, simply put, it makes a psychic link between two people. So
Doctor Keller and this...."Neeva Casol" have switched places.
They're in each other's bodies.
SHEPPARD
You know about Atlantis, right?
MAGISTRATE
(nonplussed)
Yes.
SHEPPARD
(threateningly)
Then you know you're better off being our friend than our enemy. So
why don't you be our "friend", and show us where that terminal is?
[The magistrate looks troubled, but makes a decision.]
MAGISTRATE
This way.
MCKAY
All right.
[Ronon, McKay, and Sheppard follow.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Keller continues to run through the woods.]
INT--VILLAGE VAULT
[The magistrate unlocks the door and leads them in.]
MCKAY
(worriedly)
It's still on!
SHEPPARD
Well, obviously. So turn it off.
MCKAY
Well, there's no switches. But it looks almost identical to the one
SG-1 found.
INT--VILLAGE STORE
[Beckett works with surgical equipment to pull out the bullet from
Neeva's side.]
BECKETT
There's the bullet. Now to stem the bleeding.
[He drops the bullet into a tray Teyla is holding. Teyla looks on
worriedly as she holds up an IV bag in her other hand.]
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Keller comes to a sudden stop as she sees Jannick appear before her.]
JANNICK
I don't know who you are, but you are definitely not Neeva.
KELLER
No, I'm not. But I'm not your enemy either, and if you'd just let
me...I think I can help...
[Jannick raises his gun to Keller's head.]
JANNICK
You're not helping anyone.
INT--VILLAGE VAULT
[McKay frantically types at some controls on his scanner, which is
hooked up to the device.]
SHEPPARD
Come on, hurry up!
MCKAY
Believe me, I'm trying. Look, there's no way to access the control
crystal. There doesn't seem to be a way to shut this thing off!
SHEPPARD
All right. What if...what if we blow it up?
MCKAY
Well, I don't know. I mean, maybe? I just...I'm just not sure if the
explosion will cause a-a sudden power surge...
SHEPPARD
What the hell'd the other guys do?
MCKAY
Well, SG-1 dialed the 'gate and tossed the device into the vortex of
a forming wormhole. It disintegrated instantly. But, you know, it's
too far to carry it back to the 'gate!
EXT--FOREST, DAY
JANNICK
(furious)
You got Bordal killed, and you've almost got me killed. I'm going to
return the favor.
INT--VILLAGE VAULT
SHEPPARD
All right, well, we may not have much of a choice, so...give me a
hand with this.
[He moves to pick up the device. McKay goes to help even as he
protests.]
MCKAY
I'm not sure we've got the time...
RONON
Hold up...Move!
[Ronon unholsters his gun while speaking. Sheppard and McKay back up,
and Ronon fires. The energy blast causes sparks and the control
crystal's light darkens.]
INT--VILLAGE STORE
[Keller awakens in her own body, lying on the table where Beckett just
removed the bullet. She looks around in confusion, but her face
brightens in relief as she sees the IV and Teyla standing by her side.]
TEYLA
Doctor Keller?
KELLER
Teyla!
BECKETT
You're back!
KELLER
(relieved)
I'm back.
(pained)
Ow...ow!
BECKETT
Shh. You've been shot, love. Don't worry. We removed the bullet.
You'll be just fine.
EXT--FOREST, DAY
[Neeva opens her eyes to find herself staring down the barrel of
Jannick's gun.]
NEEVA
Wait, Jannick. It's me, Neeva. They must've turned off the device.
JANNICK
Nice try.
[He cocks his revolver.]
NEEVA
(desperately)
Jannick, no!
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
[The echo of a shot is heard from the end of the previous scene.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Woolsey speaks to an expedition member.]
WOOLSEY
I appreciate that, Dana. Say hello for me.
[Dana nods and walks off. McKay comes through a transporter, carrying a
loose bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates. Woolsey joins him as
they walk down the corridor.]
WOOLSEY
Well, well, well. What's the occasion?
MCKAY
Oh, just...visiting a friend in the infirmary.
WOOLSEY
That's very thoughtful of you, Rodney.
MCKAY
I know.
WOOLSEY
Major Lorne and his team just returned. They did a full sweep of the
planet. No sign of Neeva Casol. She must've managed to escape.
MCKAY
I don't know about that. According to Jennifer, her accomplice was
just about to kill her when we shut down the communication terminal.
WOOLSEY
Well, either he did kill her and disposed of the body before
escaping himself, or she got away from him somehow.
MCKAY
Well, I guess we'll never know.
WOOLSEY
Well, we may. Word has gone out to several planets in the coalition.
If Neeva is alive and roaming free, she won't be for long.
[They part ways. McKay looks troubled.]
MCKAY
Hmm.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett stands by Keller's bedside.]
BECKETT
You'll promise you'll take it easy?
KELLER
(patronizing)
Yes, Doctor.
[McKay arrives, flowers and candy in hand.]
MCKAY
(brightly)
Don't worry. I will make sure of it!
KELLER
(pleased)
Hey, you.
MCKAY
(pleased)
Hey, you.
BECKETT
Oh, thank you, Rodney. Flowers and chocolates. I'm impressed.
[He teasingly holds out his hands for the gifts.]
MCKAY
(unamused)
Right. No. She's all alone in the infirmary. I just thought I would,
you know, brighten the room up a bit?
[Zelenka clears his throat pointedly from where he lies in the bed next
to Keller.]
MCKAY
Oh, hey Radek. How're you doing?
ZELENKA
(drily)
Better, thanks.
KELLER
(sympathetic)
Again, Radek, I am so sorry for what happened.
ZELENKA
It's not you it's your fault. I told you, don't worry. I'm fine.
[They exchange smiles.]
MCKAY
(dismissively)
Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine. He's all perky and rosy cheeked and
ready to go back to work.
[Beckett shoots him a glare.]
ZELENKA
(with annoyed sigh)
I don't know about that.
BECKETT
He needs to get rest too, Rodney.
KELLER
(admonishing)
I agree. His wound was much more serious than mine.
MCKAY
(surprised)
Really? You were shot. He was just stabbed.
[Beckett heaves an exasperated sigh.]
BECKETT
(to Zelenka)
Perhaps I should wheel you into another room?
ZELENKA
Just until he's gone, please, thank you.
BECKETT
Aye. Right.
(to McKay, in farewell)
Rodney.
MCKAY
Hmm.
[Beckett unlocks the wheels on Zelenka's bed and starts to wheel him
out.]
ZELENKA
Cursing in Czech.
BECKETT
Yes, yes. I completely agree.
ZELENKA
Continues grumbling in Czech.
[Keller smiles as she watches them leave.]
MCKAY
(to Keller)
Chocolates?
KELLER
Thank you.
[He sits in the chair next to her.]
MCKAY
So, I was thinking that, uh, when you were feeling better, we could
maybe, um...you know, go for a ride.
KELLER
A ride?
MCKAY
Yeah, you know, take the puddle jumper, go to the mainland, maybe
have a picnic, maybe...lay out under the stars?
[Keller blinks at him.]
MCKAY
What?
KELLER
You did...turn off that communication terminal, right? There's no
one else in there?
MCKAY
No, it's really me.
KELLER
(dubious)
'Cause a puddle jumper ride? And the picnic under the stars? I mean,
that's just so...
MCKAY
So not me. Right. Okay. No. Bad idea.
KELLER
No...
(she takes his hand)
I think it's a great idea.
[They smile at each other.]
