TEASER
INT--COCKPIT
[Sheppard is in a cockpit, wearing a spacesuit, including helmet. The
cockpit is vibrating intensely.]
SHEPPARD
Initiating separation maneuver in three...two...one...mark!
[He presses a button. An alarm sounds.]
SHEPPARD
Separation is negative, switching to backup. Disengage, come on.
[The alarm sounds again.]
SHEPPARD
Dammit! The bolts will not work. I repeat, the explosive bolts will
not fire! Unable to separate ship! I don't know if you can hear me,
but it looks like I'm going to have to ride this one down!
[He struggles to keep control of the joystick.]
EIGHT HOURS EARLIER
EXT--SPACE
[The team is inside a space station that is inside a lifeless moon.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and McKay, wearing space suits, walk through a darkened
corridor, using flashlights to light their way.]
SHEPPARD
Well, you wanted to take a look, now you have.
MCKAY
What? We just got here!
SHEPPARD
We've been here long enough. There's nothing here of any use to us.
MCKAY
We can't know that until we've explored deeper into the station.
SHEPPARD
I guarantee, you're gonna see pretty much the same technology that
you're looking at here, which I'd call vintage 1967.
MCKAY
(caustically)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, we hollowed out a lot of moons back in the
sixties.
SHEPPARD
Well, if we did, this is what it would it would look like.
MCKAY
What about that shuttle, huh? You know, the one we saw when we
docked?
SHEPPARD
That was very 007.
MCKAY
Ah, see? Even you were intrigued.
SHEPPARD
(admitting)
A little bit.
[McKay spots something on a side corridor and takes off. Sheppard
continues forward, not noticing McKay has left him.]
SHEPPARD
Look, Elizabeth gave us the go ahead to explore this station, if,
and I underline the "if" there, we find anything we can use against
our many and sundry bad guys. This technology's antiquated at best.
These containers are just full of supplies.
[McKay rejoins Sheppard.]
MCKAY
Building a place like this inside a moon must've taken tremendous
resources. Whoever built it, must've had a damn good reason. And if
we want to find out what that reason is, we need to look further
inside.
SHEPPARD
Teyla, Ronon, you listening to this?
INT--SPACE STATION DOCKING AREA
[An alien space craft sits at one of the darkened docks. The only
lights come from inside the puddle jumper, which is docked at another
spot. Teyla and Ronon are inside.]
TEYLA
(sighing)
Yes, yes we are, Colonel Sheppard.
SHEPPARD
You guys care what's inside this place?
RONON
No.
TEYLA
(diplomatically)
Perhaps it would be more appropriate for a team of scientists to
return.
SHEPPARD
Good idea. We're out of here.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
MCKAY
Wait, wait, wait, wait! "I need to find out what's inside. I'm the
same way with Christmas presents and pinatas. One more compartment,
other side of this door.
[He points out a closed door.]
SHEPPARD
Okay. Just one more!
[They open the door.]
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
Looks like some kind of control room.
[They look around. Sheppard looks outside a window at the alien
spacecraft in the docking bay.]
SHEPPARD
Look at that.
MCKAY
Heh, heh, heh. Intrigued?
SHEPPARD
Looks like it was built for re-entry.
[McKay studies the controls.]
MCKAY
It looks like some kind of rudimentary computer system, but it's
locked up. Let me see if I can reboot it...get power online.
[He looks at other controls.]
SHEPPARD
(concerned)
You think that's such a good idea? Didn't you say this station's
probably powered by a nuclear reactor?
[McKay throws some switches.]
MCKAY
Oh, it's definitely powered by a reactor, and...I just increased its
power output.
[The level of lighting increases.]
SHEPPARD
(angry)
Rodney!
MCKAY
(unrepentant)
You said you wanted to take a closer look at that shuttle.
SHEPPARD
I did not!
[McKay continues to work controls.]
MCKAY
Eh, well you were thinking it. Besides, I'll have life support
online in no time. Closing outer doors...
SHEPPARD
(worried)
Why?
MCKAY
So we can re-pressurize the hangar, so we can get out of these
suits.
SHEPPARD
It's not our job to satisfy your curiosity.
MCKAY
Hey, we can't stop now. We just cracked open the pinata!
[An alarm beeps.]
SHEPPARD
Hey, what's that?
MCKAY
I'm picking up an energy spike from one of the other compartments.
[The alarm suddenly ceases.]
MCKAY
(puzzled)
Now it's gone.
SHEPPARD
Good.
MCKAY
Not good. There's something frighteningly familiar about that energy
signature. Check your life signs detector again.
[Sheppard looks at the device.]
SHEPPARD
We've got company.
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Sheppard and McKay enter the room. There are two long tables; one is
empty. On the other a large chamber has lights on. They cautiously move
through the room, finding a man lying sprawled on the floor,
unconscious.]
SHEPPARD
All right. Who the hell is this guy?
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[The Stargate is active. Weir speaks into the radio.]
WEIR
You reported that there were no life signs. How did he get there?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We don't know yet.
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Sheppard is out of his space suit. McKay has removed his helmet. Teyla
treats the unconscious man.]
[The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard's team's
location and Atlantis.]
SHEPPARD
Some kind of a energy spike right when his life signs popped up.
MCKAY
I recognized the energy signature. It's very similar, virtually
identical to Wraith beaming technology. I-I-I think he was
automatically reintegrated when life support systems started up.
WEIR
Beaming technology?! A minute ago, you said the station was
antiquated!
SHEPPARD
Eh, other than the one upgrade.
MCKAY
And the artificial gravity.
[Sheppard walks out of the jumper and looks around the station again.]
SHEPPARD
I'd say early Apollo program.
MCKAY
Yeah, well, I'll need to take a closer look, but I am pretty sure
that that device is modified Wraith technology. Probably from a
crashed dart. If you think about it, it's actually a brilliant
fusion of--
WEIR
(interrupting)
And what do you intend to do with this person we've now assumed
responsibility for?
MCKAY
Well, I don't know. I didn't think that far ahead.
WEIR
Yeah, obviously not, but if one person beamed out of nowhere...
SHEPPARD
There may be others where he came from. I was thinking the same
thing.
TEYLA
He is regaining consciousness!
[Sheppard reenters the jumper.]
SHEPPARD
All right. We'll find out in a minute. Our little boy's waking up.
We'll call you in one hour.
WEIR
One hour it is.
[The connection to Atlantis shuts off.]
[The man, Herick, groans as he sits up. He looks at the team in alarm.]
TEYLA
(reassuring)
It is all right. You are among friends.
[He looks at them all again.]
HERICK
(hoarsely)
The war is over?
SHEPPARD
We're not from here. I'm Sheppard; this is McKay, Teyla, Ronon.
HERICK
Herick.
TEYLA
I am sorry, Herick, but we have scanned the surface of your planet.
If your world was at war with the Wraith, the war was lost, many
years ago.
MCKAY
Mmm, more like centuries. I mean, there's nothing down there but
ruins and plant life.
[Teyla shifts uncomfortably at McKay's comments.]
SHEPPARD
Dial up the sensitivity a notch, all right?
[McKay looks startled.]
HERICK
Defeat was expected, but...but the computer was supposed to extract
me automatically--in order to restore the others.
MCKAY
Unfortunately, the computer froze. It was completely locked up. You
probably should've used a Mac.
SHEPPARD
What-what others?
HERICK
The others in storage.
MCKAY
You used Wraith beaming technology for long-term storage? That's
crazy! Well, the energy patterns couldn't possibly stay stable that
long.
HERICK
Our engineers found a way.
SHEPPARD
Back up a second. How many others?
HERICK
Each module was to store over a thousand.
TEYLA
Then...this place was...?
HERICK
Created to save the last of my people. Once the Wraith were gone,
and the planet was once again habitable, I was to fly one of the two
shuttles back to the surface, but...obviously something went wrong.
SHEPPARD
On that subject, uh, there's only one shuttle out there.
HERICK
No, that's impossible.
[He stands wobbly and tries to leave. Ronon holds him back with a hand
on his chest.]
HERICK
Please! I must get to the pattern storage room! The second storage
pattern module was to be stored on the other shuttle. Half those
chosen for the sanctuary were to be on board, including my wife and
son.
SHEPPARD
(to Ronon)
Yeah, let him go.
(to Teyla and McKay)
You two stay here.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDORS
[Sheppard and Ronon run after Herick.]
INT--INFIRMARY
[They arrive seconds after Herick, who's very distraught.]
HERICK
They were to launch within hours of us. Jamus gave me his word.
RONON
Maybe the Wraith got to them before they could get to it.
[Herick starts handling the controls.]
HERICK
No, they were ready. I spoke to the pilot myself. They were just
hours behind us.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Sheppard, I'm getting another power spike. What's going on?
SHEPPARD
What are you doing?
HERICK
Getting answers.
[And older man is re-materialized. Sheppard and Ronon raise their
weapons automatically. Herick attacks him, bunching his fists into the
man's shirts.]
HERICK
They were to be here when I awoke. You gave me your word!
JAMUS
Herick!
[Sheppard pulls Herick off him. Jamus collapses onto a seat.]
SHEPPARD
All right, take it easy! Let the man take a breath!
JAMUS
I don't understand.
HERICK
Where is the second storage device?
[He points to the empty table. Jamus's expression changes to
understanding, and sadness.]
JAMUS
(still breathless)
They waited too long to launch the second shuttle. Herick, I'm
sorry.
HERICK
I worked every day of my life to complete this place, with the
promise that when it was done, my wife and son would be among the
ones saved. You made me that promise when you stored my pattern in
the device.
JAMUS
Shortly after you were stored in the device, word came from the
planet that the last group had not yet made it to the second
shuttle. With the launch of the first just hours before, the secret
was out. There were riots on the street! Much of our leadership was
in that last group!
[Jamus rises, and paces, frustrated.]
HERICK
You delayed the launch. How long did you wait?
JAMUS
A day. But in that day, the Wraith came, Herick. Through the portal.
We knew it was the beginning. We knew it was an advance scout. It
had happened far too many times in our history. We knew!
HERICK
Why didn't you order them to launch?
JAMUS
Because the second shuttle would've led the Wraith straight here! It
was the only way. You must understand that!
RONON
It sounds to me like you did it to save yourself.
JAMUS
No. To preserve the others who are already in storage. If the Wraith
had followed the second shuttle, if they had discovered what we had
done, they would've blasted this moon from the sky! It was the
hardest decision I have ever made. But if I had not made it, your
life's work would've meant nothing.
[McKay enters.]
MCKAY
Another life sign just appeared on the shuttle's HUD.
(he spots Jamus)
Oh. Hi. I'm McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay. I was the one who powered up
your station.
[He reaches out his hand to shake. Jamus nods politely.]
MCKAY
(awkwardly)
And...you're welcome.
JAMUS
(politely)
My people are grateful for your assistance.
HERICK
We don't need them.
SHEPPARD
(insulted)
We do have a ship.
MCKAY
(smugly)
One that, no offense, is better than that, uh, shuttle you've got
there? We could get you back down to the planet and restoring your
civilization in no time.
HERICK
(bitter)
Does your ship have an internal power supply attuned to the storage
device?
[Sheppard and McKay exchange looks. Jamus holds out his hand
reassuringly and moves closer to Herick.]
JAMUS
Herick wishes to finish the task that will complete his life's work.
And when you've flown our people back to the surface, then the new
era we have dreamed of will begin, free of the Wraith for all time!
HERICK
(flatly)
For all time. Forgive me.
[Ronon studies the exchange. Jamus claps Herick on the arm.]
HERICK
I must prepare the shuttle for launch.
JAMUS
Of course.
[Herick leaves.]
MCKAY
Well, if you want a hand with the, uh, control room, I could um...
[Herick keeps moving, ignoring McKay, who pops his lips several times,
recognizing the snub.]
MCKAY
Or maybe not.
SHEPPARD
We'll leave you folks to it.
[Jamus nods. Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon start to leave.]
RONON
(to Sheppard)
Uh, Sheppard, I wouldn't leave this guy with that guy right now, not
unless you want this guy dead.
[He points towards Jamus. The trio pauses at the doorway.]
SHEPPARD
You really think he would, uh...?
RONON
I would.
[They look at Jamus, who's working the controls, oblivious to them.]
SHEPPARD
Jamus, we're gonna...stick around for a while, make sure everyone
gets safely back to the planet...happy to give you a ride if you
need one.
JAMUS
(with wan smile)
Thank you, I-I'm most grateful.
SHEPPARD
(to McKay)
Why don't you head up to the control room?
[McKay starts off. Ronon hangs back.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Teyla, we're going to stay a little longer.
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[Herick enters and activates some controls. In the hangar, the shuttle
begins to power up. He leaves.]
INT--SPACE STATION
[Herick runs through the corridors, slamming open half-way closed doors
in his haste. He reaches the shuttle docking bay.]
INT--SHUTTLE
[Herick enters the shuttle, opening each section on his way. Teyla
intercepts him.]
TEYLA
(sympathetically)
Herick, I understand how difficult this must be for you. I too have
lost...many loved ones to the Wraith.
HERICK
(emotional)
What I feel was not caused by the Wraith.
TEYLA
Still, if there is anything--
HERICK
(interrupting sharply)
You've done enough!
TEYLA
I...do not understand.
HERICK
If you had never come, if I had never awoken, my last thoughts
would've been of hope for the future and the love I had for my
family. I never would've had to feel what I feel now. Gather your
team and leave this place.
[Herick storms away. Teyla chases after him.]
TEYLA
Herick! Herick!
[Herick brushes past McKay on his way. Teyla stops chasing him.]
MCKAY
(distracted)
Oh, he's not doing so good, is he?
TEYLA
(sighing, frustrated)
No.
[She heads in another direction.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Jamus works on the storage device.]
SHEPPARD
Is everyone still in there?
JAMUS
It appears we spent far longer in the device than was ever intended,
but yes, it seems our engineers did very well.
[Teyla arrives.]
TEYLA
Colonel Sheppard, I'm concerned about Herick.
RONON
There's nothing we can do for him.
TEYLA
(concerned)
He just warned us to leave.
JAMUS
(dismissively)
He's understandably distraught. He'll be fine when he gets to the
planet.
[Sheppard and Ronon do not look appeased; they take Teyla's concern
seriously.]
SHEPPARD
Just the same, I'm going to go see what he's up to.
(to Teyla)
You stay here.
[Jamus looks up, surprised. Sheppard and Ronon leave Teyla with Jamus.]
INT--SHUTTLE
[Herick runs through the shuttle, leaving open every door.]
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[McKay notices alarms starting to beep. ]
MCKAY
What is he doing?
[He goes to the window to look at the shuttle. Herick stares back at
him from a full length window in the corridor. Herick starts to run
back down the corridor.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Herick, what are you doing?
INT--SHUTTLE
[Herick climbs a stairwell to the cockpit and sits in the seat,
powering things up.]
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(panicked)
Sheppard, you need to get Herick out of that shuttle, now!
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDORS
[Sheppard and Ronon run towards the shuttle.]
SHEPPARD
We're on our way.
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Herick continues to operate controls.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Herick, if you're doing what I think you're do--
[Herick shuts off the radio. He presses more buttons and the engines
start up. He leaves cockpit.]
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[McKay watches as the shuttle rockets fire, but the ship remains docked
inside the closed bay.]
MCKAY
He's fired the engines! Hang on!
INT--SHUTTLE
[Looking desperate, but determined, Herick walks back to the window.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[The room vibrates.]
JAMUS
What's happening?
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
(into radio)
The outer doors won't hold! You need to shut the hatches to your
compartments! All of them!
[McKay struggles to the door to the control room, closing it.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Teyla seals herself and Jamus inside.]
INT--DOCKING BAY
[Herick continues to stare blankly out the window. He closes his eyes.
The shuttle's rockets take their toll on the bay doors. They explode.
The force of the blast and depressurization pulls the puddle jumper out
the hole; it gets knocked about by the flames as it enters space.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon struggle against the strong wind force now in the
corridor to try and shut the doors. Ronon pushes one door closed, but
the pressure against it builds and a blast wave slams the door open and
knocks Ronon into a far wall, where he falls.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[The blast percussion knocks Jamus and Teyla off their feet.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard still struggles to the far door. Ronon does the same.]
EXT--SPACE
[The rocket blast moves the moon's orbit drastically by slowing it in
the direction of its orbit. It falls closer to the planet.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon still fight the wind to reach the door. Their
combined efforts finally start to close it.]
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[McKay stares back out the window, watching the engines finally flare
out.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard regains his balance after sealing the door. He slowly moves
to the other door and closes it, holding his breath as much as he can.
Job completed, he collapses unconscious.]
EXT--SPACE
[Debris from the explosion, including the puddle jumper, floats in
space. The docking bay is empty except for the now powered-down
shuttle.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Sheppard, Ronon, come in!
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard regains consciousness.]
MCKAY
(despairing, over radio)
Sheppard, Ronon...come in.
[Sheppard looks over. Ronon is still unconscious.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Still here...barely.
[He struggles to get up.]
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard's and McKay's
locations.]
MCKAY
(relieved)
Huh! I was pretty sure you were dead!
SHEPPARD
Yeah, well, same here.
MCKAY
According to the readings in here, your compartment was almost
completely vented Look, it took almost a minute to re-pressurize.
[Sheppard heads over to Ronon, checking his pulse. As he moves to check
Ronon's shoulder, Ronon awakens with a pained cry.]
RONON
Oh!
SHEPPARD
Don't move.
[Sheppard sits next to him.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Teyla? Teyla?
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Teyla moves some storage containers off of Jamus.]
TEYLA
I am fine. But Jamus is injured. He will need medical attention.
SHEPPARD
Well, he's going to have to wait.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
McKay, what the hell just happened?
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
Herick just killed himself and tried to take us with him. Chances
are, he succeeded too. I watched him open the rear hatch of the
shuttle before he fired the main engines.
SHEPPARD
Why would he do that?
MCKAY
(sarcastic)
You know, I never really got to know him, so uh...
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
Okay, okay, what do you know?
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
The compartments between us are in vacuum. They're possibly damaged
by the explosion. We're cut off from each other!
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
What else?
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
Look, just give me a second to figure out how screwed we are, and
I'll get back to you.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard stands.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Jamus awakens and struggles to get up. Blood drips out of his nose.]
JAMUS
(disoriented)
Herick?
TEYLA
(gently)
We believe he took his own life...and tried to kill us.
JAMUS
Wh-why would he?
TEYLA
It is best that you do not move until we know the full extent of
your injuries.
JAMUS
And the device?
[They both look at the module.]
TEYLA
It appears to be intact.
[She helps him sit up.]
INT--SPACES STATION CORRIDOR
[Ronon forces himself to a seated position with an agonized cry.]
SHEPPARD
I told you, don't move! Your shoulder's dislocated.
[Ronon ignores him and gets to his feet, leaning on the wheel that
opens the door.]
SHEPPARD
Just wait for Beckett to get here, all right? Weir will send a team
as soon as she doesn't hear from us, which should be...any minute,
now.
[Sheppard has been looking around while talking, not noticing that
Ronon has been ignoring him and wedged his injured arm in the hatch's
wheel. He turns just in time to see Ronon sharply turn, forcing his
shoulder back into place with an agonized cry. Ronon frees his arm and
collapses against the bulkhead. Sheppard stares at his friend in
alarm.]
SHEPPARD
(worried)
That's disturbing.
RONON
(weakly)
I don't like to wait.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Okay, time for the "how screwed we are" report.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right, go ahead.
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[The rest of the conversation switches between McKay's and Sheppard's
locations.]
MCKAY
There's no way to seal the compartments between us from here. You
know, there's too many hatches left open. Herick was obviously
trying to vent the station to space. Look, I'm going to suit up--see
what I can do.
SHEPPARD
Doesn't sound too screwed.
[McKay grabs his helmet.]
MCKAY
Oh, ho, ho. But I'm not finished yet. Because the shuttle was
attached and exhausted all of its fuel during the burn, the moon has
been knocked out of its orbit.
SHEPPARD
How much time do we have?
MCKAY
Before we burn up, or before we suffocate? Because the reactor
scrammed and shut down during all this, so we're down to emergency
power, most of which is being channeled into the people storage
device.
SHEPPARD
Well, I don't know, pick one!
MCKAY
Not done yet. Cause there's still the fact that the jumper was
blasted out of the docking port so there's no way off this rock in
either case.
SHEPPARD
Well, Weir will send a rescue team.
MCKAY
Well, we don't have much time left. The moon was already in a low
orbit to start with. We're beginning to skim the outer atmosphere.
We're going to slow down exponentially.
SHEPPARD
Think of a brilliant plan, Rodney! That's what you do best--using as
little oxygen as possible.
[The moon shudders, everyone feeling its effects. The movement jostles
Ronon's injury.]
RONON
(in pain)
Oh!
MCKAY
Should I just repeat everything I just told you?
SHEPPARD
(firmly)
We don't leave our people behind, did you forget that?
MCKAY
(sighing)
No.
SHEPPARD
Good. They'll show up, and they'll get us out of here. Clear?
MCKAY
(rolling his eyes)
Yes, that's clear. McKay out.
INT--SPACE STATION DOCKING BAY
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Jamus coughs.]
JAMUS
I'm sorry for this.
TEYLA
You blame yourself?
JAMUS
I gave the order that ended the lives of Herick's family.
TEYLA
(sighing)
You made a difficult decision.
[Jamus looks to the device.]
JAMUS
If these thousand souls can yet be saved, it will have been the
right one.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Ronon paces the compartment.]
RONON
I'm not good at this.
SHEPPARD
What?
RONON
Waiting to die.
SHEPPARD
Well, don't think about it.
RONON
I don't like small spaces.
SHEPPARD
Could be worse.
RONON
Personally, I'd rather die fighting.
SHEPPARD
I'd rather not die!
RONON
I'm just saying...
SHEPPARD
Okay, look, if this rock burns up in the atmosphere, I'll fight you
to the death myself. Deal?
[Ronon grins and sits.]
RONON
You're on.
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
All right...
[McKay moves to a station, working some controls. He glances out the
window just in time to see a large piece of the hangar door floating
right towards him. He scrambles for his helmet.]
MCKAY
Oh no...no!
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
MCKAY
(panicked, over radio)
I've got a problem here!
[Sheppard sits up, alert at McKay's tone.]
SHEPPARD
What's happening?
INT--SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM
[The debris strikes the window and bounces off, leaving a tiny nick in
the glass.]
MCKAY
(elated)
I'm alive!
[The tiny nick becomes a crack that spreads across the glass. McKay's
face falls.]
MCKAY
(hyperventilating)
I'm dead. I'm so dead!
[He hurries to put on his helmet.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Rodney, what's happening?
MCKAY
(hurriedly)
The control room window's just been hit by a piece of debris from
the explosion. It's about to breach!
[Helmet on, McKay's heads for the door.]
SHEPPARD
(worried)
McKay?
MCKAY
Can't talk now!
[He grabs hold just as the window shatters, rapidly decompressing the
room. Once the initial wind effect is done, McKay opens the door and
closes it behind him.]
MCKAY
We just lost the control room.
SHEPPARD
Didn't seem like it controlled much anyway.
MCKAY
True. All right, I'm going to take a look around. See if I can
figure out a way to seal the compartments between us. I figure it
would be nice if we were all together as we burn up.
[He seals doors behind him as he goes down the corridor.]
SHEPPARD
(admonishing)
McKay...
MCKAY
I'm sorry, I mean as we..get rescued. I always get those two
confused.
[He looks at a door that is already sealed and moves on.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon exchange looks.]
EXT--SPACE
[The moon orbits closer to the planet.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[McKay continues to seal off doors. He reaches an area with several
doors, all closed. After looking around, he goes to the one on the
left, which while closed, is unsealed. He moves some debris. The
station shudders once again, startling him. McKay wrestles with the
door.]
MCKAY
If anyone's counting, we have another problem. I can't seal the
compartments between us because one of the hatches won't shut.
SHEPPARD
What's wrong with it?
MCKAY
Looks like the entire bulkhead was twisted when Sammy Suicide
decided to fire up his rocket ship.
SHEPPARD
We're gonna need that hatch, McKay.
MCKAY
(annoyed)
Yes, I know that. I am the one who told you. I'll try.
[He shifts more debris.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir enters from her office.]
WEIR
It's been over an hour?
CHUCK
Yes, ma'am.
WEIR
All right then, dial them up.
INT--SPACE STATION COMPARTMENT, SHEPPARD AND RONON'S LOCATION
[The conversation switches between Atlantis and the station.]
WEIR
Colonel Sheppard, do you read me?
SHEPPARD
Loud and clear. You're timing's perfect. Now, you need to get
Beckett here with a rescue team and some cutting equipment as soon
as possible.
WEIR
(to Chuck)
Do it.
(into radio)
What's happened?
SHEPPARD
We got ourselves in a damaged moon base in a decaying orbit, cut off
from each other, and we lost the jumper. That happened. Well,
there's more to it than that, but-but you get the idea.
WEIR
Help is on its way. What else can we do?
RONON
(pained)
Hurry!
EXT--SPACE
[A puddle jumper flies through the Space Gate.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Lorne's team and Beckett are already donning space suits. One man
remains at the pilot's controls.]
LORNE
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne. We are en route and on
afterburners. We should have you out of there in no time.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon exchange relieved looks.]
SHEPPARD
Understood. You're going to have to convert the jumper's cloak into
a shield and extend it to the station to create a seal.
LORNE
We're already on it, sir.
BECKETT
How are my patients doing?
SHEPPARD
Jamus could use your help.
BECKETT
Tell him I'll be there in a jiff.
SHEPPARD
You guys hear that?
MCKAY
(drily, over radio)
Yay, faint hope.
TEYLA
We did, John. We're glad to hear it.
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[The station shudders once again.]
JAMUS
Your friends are coming for us?
TEYLA
Yes, and Doctor Beckett as well. He will take good care of you.
JAMUS
And my people?
TEYLA
I'm sure that if it is at all possible--
JAMUS
It must be! There are over a thousand souls in this device. An
entire people will be gone forever if we don't find a way.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[McKay struggles with the warped door and bulkhead.]
TEYLA
(over radio)
Doctor McKay.
MCKAY
(straining with effort)
Busy working right now. Call back later.
TEYLA
It is a matter of great importance to Jamus.
MCKAY
(resigned)
Yeah, well what is it?
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[The rest of the conversation switches between McKay's and Teyla's
locations.]
TEYLA
Will it be possible to take the people stored in the device along
with us?
MCKAY
No. No, there's not a chance. Look, the internal batteries would run
out in half the time it would take me to patch in a compatible power
source. Look, maybe, maybe if I could keep it in the compartment,
but, uh, we're not sticking around that long. We're in a decaying
orbit, remember?
TEYLA
(brightly)
Then there is an excellent chance that we will be able to save them.
[She glances back toward Jamus, who can only hear Teyla's side of the
conversation. He's watching her keenly.]
MCKAY
What?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I said no.
TEYLA
Jamus will be very happy to hear this.
MCKAY
What are you--Oh, okay. Er, yeah, tell him no problem. The more the
merrier.
TEYLA
(nodding reassuringly)
Doctor McKay assures me that it will be possible.
[Jamus stares at her, still struggling to breathe.]
INT--SPACE STATION DOCKING AREA
[Lorne's puddle jumper connects to a docking bay.]
LORNE
(over radio)
Okay, we're in.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Lorne and Beckett walk through the corridors. They wear space suits
and carry cases.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[McKay is trying to close the hatch.]
MCKAY
(straining)
Come on! Close! Come on.
[Lorne comes up behind McKay and knocks on his helmet.]
MCKAY
What the...?
[He spins around.]
LORNE
How about I take over, Doc?
MCKAY
(relieved)
Oh thank god! I can't get the hatch shut! I can't Sheppard, Ronon or
Teyla out of the compartments until I get the hatch shut.
[Lorne starts to unpack his equipment.]
LORNE
Not a problem. Just head on back to the jumper.
MCKAY
No. No, we don't leave our people behind.
[The station shudders.]
LORNE
You're not going anywhere, Doc. You're just heading back to the
jumper to figure out how much time we have before this moon starts
breaking up in the atmosphere.
MCKAY
Right. You're right.
[McKay passes Lorne. Lorne gets his cutting torch, lowers his visor,
and begins to work.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY AREA
[Beckett knocks on the door outside the infirmary.]
BECKETT
(over radio)
Teyla, love, can you hear me?
[Teyla sighs in relief.]
TEYLA
Yes! Doctor Beckett, it is good to hear your voice.
BECKETT
Aye, you too. We should be able to re-pressurize and have you out in
no time. Just hang on a wee bit longer.
[Teyla crouches by Jamus's side.]
TEYLA
Our rescuers have arrived. We will be able to get out of here soon.
JAMUS
And the device?
TEYLA
(equivocating)
I'm sure we will do everything in our power.
JAMUS
Hayden Fortrum is our people's greatest living poet. He is among
those stored in this device. Our greatest scientists, Torrell and
Barnum, are stored in here as well...along with two hundred
children. You must promise me...
TEYLA
(sympathetically)
I wish I could. But I cannot "promise" what is beyond my control,
Jamus.
[Jamus stares at the module zealously.]
EXT--SPACE
[The moon still tumbles in its low orbit above the planet.]
INT--CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[Lorne packs up his cutting equipment and turns to Beckett.]
LORNE
I've got a good seal on the damaged hatch. The station is
re-pressurizing.
[He checks a monitor on his forearm.]
LORNE
Okay, we're good to go.
[Lorne and Beckett unseal their helmets.]
BECKETT
(into radio)
Colonel, Teyla, you're safe to open your hatches.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Sheppard and Ronon instantly stand and head to the door.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Great. McKay, how much time do we have?
MCKAY
(over radio)
Not much. We're getting dangerously close to the planet's
atmosphere. The moon won't survive another orbit.
[Sheppard and Ronon open the door and run out.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
TEYLA
It is time to leave.
[She helps Jamus up. They head to the door. Another shudder runs
through the station, making them both stumble. In the confusion, Jamus
grabs Teyla's sidearm and points it at her shakily.]
TEYLA
Jamus, what are you doing?
JAMUS
I cannot allow you to leave. Not until you ensure the safety of my
people.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[Beckett strains to open the door to the infirmary.]
BECKETT
(into radio)
Teyla, you can open the hatch. It's safe.
[Sheppard and Ronon arrive.]
SHEPPARD
Hey, Doc.
BECKETT
Colonel. Ronon, you okay?
RONON
Yeah, I'm good, Doc.
SHEPPARD
What's the problem?
BECKETT
Teyla's hatch is locked from the inside.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Teyla, open up the door. We've got to get out of here.
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Teyla rolls her eyes.]
TEYLA
(into radio)
I can't do that, John! Jamus has my sidearm, and will not let me
leave until we find a way to preserve the storage device.
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[Ronon and Lorne exchange looks.]
SHEPPARD
All right, tell him we'll try.
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[The conversations switches between the infirmary and the junction
right outside.]
TEYLA
I've already done so. He does not believe me.
SHEPPARD
Put him on the radio.
[Teyla unhooks her earpiece and pulls her radio out of her tac vest,
holding it out towards Jamus.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Jamus, can you hear me?
JAMUS
(nodding)
I can.
SHEPPARD
I want you to listen carefully. If there was time to save the
storage device, we would. You know that. We got into this mess by
offering to stick around and help you in the first place. But, we
can save you. This is your life we're talking about, all right? So
just...open up the door.
JAMUS
I have her weapon.
[The station shudders violently.]
SHEPPARD
(through gritted teeth)
This rock is going to burn up in the atmosphere.
BECKETT
Meaning if you don't open this door, you'll die.
JAMUS
Then I will die with my people!
SHEPPARD
Okay, open up the door and let Teyla out and you can die with your
people.
(to Lorne)
Get the torch.
[Lorne starts to unpack his equipment, rolling it over to Sheppard.
Sheppard puts on safety goggles and gloves that Lorne hands him.]
SHEPPARD
Jamus, we're gonna open up this door one way or the other. And if we
have to do it the hard way, my offer to take you with us is off the
table.
JAMUS
There is nothing more to say.
[Sheppard starts cutting. Inside, Teyla lowers the radio.]
TEYLA
Sacrificing your own life will not save them.
JAMUS
My life does not matter.
[Sparks start to fly as Sheppard's cutting torch starts to break
through the door.]
TEYLA
(desperately)
If you live, their memory will be preserved!
JAMUS
You still do not grasp what is at stake! Just how many have
sacrificed so that our people could have a future! It took the
resources of five generations to build this station! We fought a war
we knew we could not win so that there could be a future!
TEYLA
(confused)
You knew you could not win the war?!
JAMUS
We came to realize that if there were no more survivors, the Wraith
would not return. We built weapons to ensure that when the war was
over, there would be no more survivors.
TEYLA
(appalled)
You killed your own people?
JAMUS
We killed Wraith. Every ship that landed was struck by our atomic
weapons. We knew that the radioactive clouds would spread over every
continent. We knew the planet would be uninhabitable for many years.
TEYLA
(nonplussed)
And so you built this place?
JAMUS
That we could rebuild without fear of the Wraith ever returning. So
you see, these souls must survive. If they do not, the many hundreds
of thousands lost in the war will have died for nothing.
[Teyla reaches towards Jamus, but he waves the pistol, keeping her
back.]
JAMUS
Don't! Don't! Your life is all I have to bargain with, I do not wish
to take it.
[The station shudders even more violently, but Jamus keeps his hold and
distance.]
EXT--SPACE
[The moon is starting to burn in the upper atmosphere.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
BECKETT
This is taking too bloody long!
[Lorne has his P-90 at ready.]
SHEPPARD
I'm going as fast as I can!
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[Jamus backs over to the module device.]
TEYLA
Any moment now, Colonel Sheppard will cut through that door. If you
shoot me, they will surely kill you. Perhaps, the only way to
preserve your people now is to preserve their memory! If you die,
they will be forgotten; their deaths will go unrecorded, and the
Wraith will have won. Or leave here with us now, and keep the spirit
of your people alive inside you. Document their achievements! Their
struggles...and triumphs. Tell their story to anyone who will
listen. The choice is yours.
[Another shudder rocks the station. Jamus presses some more buttons on
the module.]
JAMUS
I never intended to take your life. My only hope is that Colonel
Sheppard is sincere in his statement that he will leave no one
behind.
[Teyla's eyes widen as she stares at Jamus's efforts.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION
[Sheppard is almost through.]
JAMUS
(yelling through door)
Colonel! Colonel! You can stop what you're doing now. I'm ready to
open the door.
[Sheppard stops. Ronon raises his gun so it's no longer pointed at the
door.]
SHEPPARD
Now he's ready.
[He takes off his equipment and stands.]
SHEPPARD
All right, we're going to open up the door. I want to see your
weapon on the ground and your hands in the air.
[The wheel slowly turns from the inside as Sheppard unholsters his
pistol and waits with the others.]
MCKAY
(over radio)
Sheppard, what's going on? I'm picking up another power surge.
[Sheppard exchanges puzzled looks with Lorne. He kicks the hatch open.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[The module is just shutting down as they enter. Neither Teyla nor
Jamus can be seen. Sheppard stares in horror at the device.]
EXT--SPACE
[The moon's orbit continues to decay, rubbing against the atmosphere.]
INT--SPACE STATION INFIRMARY
[McKay has joined Sheppard and is now studying the module.]
SHEPPARD
Are you going to be able to get her out of there or not?
MCKAY
I have no idea how to determine who's who in this thing. Look, maybe
if I had a few hours...
SHEPPARD
Well, you don't!
MCKAY
Yes, I know. But short of randomly beaming people out one-by-one...?
SHEPPARD
There's a thousand people in this thing!
MCKAY
(tightly)
I am aware of that!
[Lorne arrives just as another violent rocking moves across the ship.]
LORNE
It's time to go, sir.
SHEPPARD
Just give us a minute.
LORNE
I'm sorry, sir. We don't have a minute. As soon as this rock hits
the atmosphere, it's going to start to break up. We've got to go
now!
SHEPPARD
All right. Can-can you get this thing disconnected?
MCKAY
Yes, but I've already told you there's no way I can rig up a
compatible power source for the jumper.
SHEPPARD
I'm not talking about the jumper.
MCKAY
What?
SHEPPARD
I was always wanted to fly a space shuttle. Now's my chance!
[Sheppard starts heading out with a quick determined gait. McKay
follows.]
MCKAY
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
SHEPPARD
Just get this thing disconnected and help these guys get it to the
jumper while I suit up.
MCKAY
Look, I know how much you love to think you can fly anything, but it
is not--
[Sheppard doesn't stop or turn back.]
SHEPPARD
(yelling)
Listen. Just get the thing disconnected. That's an order!
EXT--SPACE
[The moon begins to break up.]
INT--SPACE STATION CORRIDOR
[Ronon, McKay, and Lorne wheel the module through the corridor. Ronon
still cradles his injured arm.]
LORNE
I think he's crazy. The thing's how many hundred years old? And it's
out of fuel!
RONON
The man said he could fly it.
[Behind them, Beckett helps Sheppard into his space suit.]
BECKETT
You do realize you're out of your bloody mind, right?
SHEPPARD
Yeah. Probably.
[The station rocks again. McKay returns from where they've sealed up
the device.]
MCKAY
All right, you're all set. Once you're inside the shuttle, it should
be fairly easy to get the device into the receptacle.
SHEPPARD
All right, let's do it.
MCKAY
Just...can I say one more thing?
[The station shudders again.]
SHEPPARD
As long as you say it as fast as you can.
MCKAY
Don't do this, it's impossible.
SHEPPARD
Willing to bet a week's wages on that?
MCKAY
(anguished)
Yeah, how you going to pay up if I win, huh?
SHEPPARD
Oh, thanks for caring.
MCKAY
(despondent)
Yeah.
SHEPPARD
All right. Radio Atlantis as soon as you're clear. Keep a safe
distance with the jumper, I'll try to maintain radio contact.
[Ronon stops him.]
RONON
Hey, remember. You still owe me a fight to the death.
[Sheppard closes his helmet.]
SHEPPARD
I look forward to that.
[He claps Ronon on his shoulder. Ronon winces in pain. Sheppard opens
the shuttle door.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[McKay, Beckett, Ronon, and Lorne enter the puddle jumper.]
LORNE
Get us out of here, Captain!
[The captain starts to power up the jumper.]
INT--SHUTTLE
[Sheppard finishes hooking up cables to the module.]
SHEPPARD
All right, I've got the device locked in place. Looks like internal
power switched on automatically. Closing rear hatch now. See you
guys on the ground.
[He looks out the window at the rocks flying off into space, and the
puddle jumper leaving, as the moon enters the atmosphere.]
LORNE
Will do, sir. Good luck.
INT--SPACE STATION DOCKING BAY
[The puddle jumper leaves the station.]
LORNE
We're clear, sir.
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Sheppard sits in the pilot's seat.]
[The conversation switches between the shuttle and the jumper.]
MCKAY
The moon's decelerating in the upper atmosphere. You've only got a
few minutes to familiarize yourself with those controls.
SHEPPARD
It's pretty straightforward.
MCKAY
We're going to lose radio contact as you pass through the
atmosphere.
SHEPPARD
I know, Rodney.
MCKAY
(emotional)
No, but, I'm saying that...if you have anything that you'd like to
say, now would be a good time to--
SHEPPARD
No, not really.
[The moon/station shudders continuously.]
SHEPPARD
Taking some chop.
MCKAY
Now would probably be a good time to disengage.
[McKay pulls up the HUD.]
MCKAY
Hopefully the explosive bolts will throw him clear of the moon.
EXT--SPACE
[The moon is breaking up in the atmosphere.]
EXT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
Initiating separation maneuver in three...two...one...mark!
[He presses a button. An alarm sounds.]
SHEPPARD
Separation is negative, switching to backup.
[The team on the shuttle exchange concerned looks.]
SHEPPARD
Disengage. Come on!
[The alarm sounds again.]
SHEPPARD
Dammit! The bolts will not work. I repeat, the explosive bolts will
not fire! Unable to separate ship! I don't know if you can hear me,
but it looks like I'm going to have to ride this one down!
[He struggles to keep control of the joystick.]
RONON
What's happening?
MCKAY
If he can't separate the ship, he's going to burn up inside the
moon.
[They watch the HUD.]
INT--SPACE
[The moon breaks apart.]
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Sheppard struggles with the controls.]
INT--DOCKING AREA
[The station comes apart around the shuttle.]
EXT--SPACE
[The moon disintegrates into a fireball in the atmosphere.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[They all peer at the HUD. Finally, the shuttle appears on the
display.]
MCKAY
There it is!
[Beckett sighs in relief.]
EXT--SPACE
[The shuttle coasts into the atmosphere, surrounded by intense heat
from reentry.]
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Klaxons continue to blare as Sheppard shakes from the entry, barely
holding onto the joystick.]
EXT--PLANET, DAY
[The shuttle appears as a white cloud streaking across the sky.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
[Everyone watches worriedly.]
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Sheppard struggles to guide the ship in for a landing.]
EXT--PLANET DESERT, DAY
[The shuttle glides into a controlled crash in the desert.]
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Sheppard collapses, unconscious, in the pilot's seat.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
LORNE
Get as close to the crash site as possible.
CAPTAIN
Yes, sir.
BECKETT
Can you tell if he's alive?
MCKAY
Not yet. Wait.
[A control beeps.]
MCKAY
I'm detecting one life sign.
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
[Sheppard awakens and groggily looks around.]
INT--PUDDLE JUMPER
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
That's one week's pay you owe me, Rodney.
MCKAY
You know, technically, I-I didn't take that bet.
[Beckett and Ronon laugh.]
LORNE
Hang tight, sir. We're on our way.
INT--SHUTTLE COCKPIT
SHEPPARD
(tired)
Take your time, Major. Take your time.
[He opens his helmet to the air.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, DUSK
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard enters. Weir sits by Teyla's bedside as Teyla is examined by
Beckett.]
SHEPPARD
So, I have the hard landing, but she gets the bed rest.
TEYLA
Well, I tried to tell Carson that I was perfectly fine, but he
insisted.
BECKETT
A number of people reintegrated from the storage device experienced
a small amount of memory loss. I just want to make certain that
you're...all there.
SHEPPARD
She does look a little thin.
[Teyla mock glares at Sheppard. Beckett claps Teyla on the arm.]
BECKETT
Just until the morning.
TEYLA
(to Beckett)
Thank you.
WEIR
(to Sheppard)
And I assume you've come to the infirmary in order to have your head
examined.
SHEPPARD
Hey, I pulled it off, didn't I?
WEIR
(unconvinced)
Mm-hmm.
[Teyla pats Sheppard's arm gratefully .]
TEYLA
Yes, you did.
[Weir heads out.]
WEIR
I'm going to head back to Stargate Operations. Major Lorne is about
to return to drop off supplies to Jamus's people.
SHEPPARD
Hey, what are you going to do with him, anyway?
WEIR
Uh, his injuries were such, he didn't survive the reintegration.
Hmm.
[She leaves.]
SHEPPARD
Doesn't break my heart.
TEYLA
(admonishing)
He only did what you or I would've done.
SHEPPARD
Are you kidding? He held you hostage and almost got both of us
killed!
TEYLA
He tried to save his people, and he succeeded...through you.
SHEPPARD
(gently)
That's not the reason I did it.
[Teyla smiles.]
TEYLA
I know.
SHEPPARD
Don't go feeling special, now. I'd have done it for any one of you.
TEYLA
Of course.
[He starts to leave.]
SHEPPARD
Except for maybe McKay.
TEYLA
(grinning)
Yes, I think even for Rodney!
SHEPPARD
Maybe.
FADE OUT
