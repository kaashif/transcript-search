EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[McKay watches some lab mice in their cage. Beckett is nearby.]
MCKAY
Have you got your eye on anyone?
BECKETT
Hmm...not really.
MCKAY
Actually, I was talking to the mouse, but now you mention it, some
of those Athosian women are pretty hot, and we did just save them
from the Wraith, so we've got to trade on that while you can, you
know, before they discover we're not actually that cool.
BECKETT
(patting a bed)
Sit down. I'm ready.
[McKay runs over and leaps onto the bed, rolling up the sleeve on his
left arm. Beckett rolls up his right arm instead and preps it for an
injection.]
BECKETT
I'm surprised you're so eager to volunteer for this, Rodney.
MCKAY
Well, you know me, always eager to help.
BECKETT
(dubious)
Right. So do you have any questions about the process? I mean, you
are a scientist.
MCKAY
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry, medicine is about as much of a science as is,
oh, I don't know, voodoo. All I need to know is that will enable me
to use Ancient technology like Major Sheppard, or yourself.
[Beckett taps McKay's arm to get a vein, probably somewhat harder than
necessary as he glares at McKay.]
BECKETT
Yes, hopefully. You are the first human trial.
MCKAY
Well, why now? I mean, if it's possible, we knew we'd need as many
people with the gene as we could get.
BECKETT
Well, actually, without proper FDA approval, it was virtually
impossible on Earth...let's just say it's, uh, legal here in the
Pegasus Galaxy.
MCKAY
(worried)
And completely safe?
BECKETT
As far as experimental gene therapy goes.
[McKay does not look comforted.]
BECKETT
I am manipulating your DNA. Here we go.
[Beckett readies the syringe, but McKay pulls back his arm.]
MCKAY
Maybe you should tell me more.
BECKETT
We believe A.T.A., or Ancient Technology Activation, is caused by a
single gene that's always on, instructing various cells in the body
to produce a series of proteins and enzymes that interact with the
skin, the nervous system, and the brain. In this case, we're using a
mouse retrovirus to deliver the missing gene to your cells.
MCKAY
(higher pitched)
A mouse retrovirus?
BECKETT
It's been deactivated.
MCKAY
(still worried)
Are there any side...
[Beckett injects McKay.]
MCKAY
...effects?
BECKETT
Dry mouth, headache, the irresistible urge to run on a small wheel.
MCKAY
(pained)
Oh, that's very amusing. So how long until it starts working?
BECKETT
Ah, it could take some time. What is that?
[He notices a small oval object McKay has in his left hand.]
MCKAY
Oh, something I found in one of the research labs, something the,
uh, Ancients were experimenting with.
BECKETT
Do you know what it is?
[McKay strokes the device and shoots Beckett an excited grin.]
MCKAY
Uh...pretty sure.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR GATE ROOM
[Expedition members move boxes. Weir and Grodin walk down a corridor.]
GRODIN
It's desalinizing the seawater and storing it in tanks big enough to
supply the whole city.
WEIR
Good, so fresh water won't be a problem.
GRODIN
It seems some Ancient technology requires the user to have the gene.
Other things merely require initialization. Once activated, like the
control room, anyone can push the buttons to make them work.
[They are almost run down by Jinto and two other Athosian boys coming
down the stairs they are ascending.]
JINTO
Good morning, Doctor Weir.
WEIR
(bemused)
Morning. Careful!
(to Grodin)
I think we need to designate some recreational areas...
GRODIN
Yes.
WEIR
And we certainly need to clear the hallways and get everything put
away as soon as possible, and can we lose the ten-thousand-year-old
dead plants?
GRODIN
Of course. We're still in the process of making sure everyone's been
assigned living quarters. Major Sheppard seems to be taking his time
okaying enough space.
WEIR
Well, the safety and security of this expedition are his--
MCKAY
(heard from distance)
Okay, I'm ready.
[Weir and Grodin turn to see Sheppard push McKay off the balcony across
from them, down into the Gate Room below.]
WEIR
Oh, my God.
SHEPPARD
(pleased)
Did you see that?
WEIR
Yes! What the...?
[They look down to see McKay leaping to his feet, completely unharmed.
The object he was holding in the infirmary is now glowing green and
attached to his chest, over his t-shirt.]
MCKAY
I'm fine.
[He and Sheppard exchange wide grins. Sheppard, Weir, and Grodin hurry
down the steps to meet him.]
MCKAY
Look, Beckett's gene therapy worked. I was able to activate this.
It's a, uh, personal shield, acts like a, uh, protective skin, and
it must have inertial dampening properties, too, because I didn't
feel a thing. Watch this.
(to Grodin)
Hit me.
[Grodin tries to punch McKay in the face. A few inches away, his fist
strikes a green energy field, knocking him back.]
GRODIN
Ow! God.
[Jinto and his friends laugh while Grodin nurses his hand.]
MCKAY
You didn't have to swing so hard. And notice that he didn't even
hesitate!
WEIR
I'm still trying to understand how you thought it was a good idea to
test this device by having someone throw you off a balcony.
MCKAY
Oh, believe me, that's not the first thing we tried.
SHEPPARD
I shot him.
[Weir tilts her head expectantly.]
SHEPPARD
(shrugging)
In the leg.
MCKAY
(elated)
I'm invulnerable.
WEIR
Aren't you the one who's always spouting off about how proper and
careful scientific procedure must be adhered to?
[McKay bounces on the balls of his feet, his good mood not hampered by
Weir's lecture.]
MCKAY
(in sing-song)
In-vulner-able.
WEIR
All right, take it off. Let's go have this meeting.
MCKAY
(muttering)
You're just jealous.
WEIR
(dryly)
Oh, yes, green with envy.
[McKay tries to take it off, but the shield stops his hand from being
able to touch it.]
MCKAY
This could be a problem. I can't get at it.
[Sheppard tries, but he too is repelled. McKay looks at him.]
SHEPPARD
Just checking.
END TEASER
OPENING CREDITS
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett wraps Grodin's injured hand.]
GRODIN
I'm thinking "Mr. Invincible."
BECKETT
"Captain Untouchable."
GRODIN
Ooh, that's good.
[They laugh. McKay scowls at them from nearby.]
MCKAY
Are you guys done?
BECKETT
I've been working on this gene therapy for months. Forgive me for
wanting to celebrate the fact that it worked on the first human
trial.
[McKay rolls his eyes and waves his hands.]
MCKAY
(sarcastically)
Oh, let's all have a toast.
[Beckett's and Grodin's expressions change from amused to concerned as
they both turn to McKay.]
BECKETT
Um...
GRODIN
Just a thought here, but have you tried eating or drinking anything
since you put that on?
[McKay looks horrified. He pours a cup of coffee and tries to drink it.
It spills down the shield before getting anywhere near his mouth. He
pours the rest down himself.]
MCKAY
That's great.
BECKETT
This may be more serious than I suspected.
MCKAY
Well, thank you. I'm hungry already. What am I going to do? If I
don't get this stupid thing off, I'll be dead by the end of the day.
BECKETT
Relax, you can live three or four days without water.
MCKAY
Yeah, I'm talking about food.
BECKETT
Well, you found some Ancient text with the device. What did it say
about taking it off?
MCKAY
Oh, yeah, there were some explicit instructions, which I chose to
completely ignore.
GRODIN
Well, some Ancient technology uses a mental component for operation.
MCKAY
Just shut up. I'm thinking.
[He closes his eyes in concentration and stands quietly for several
moments.]
GRODIN
(to Beckett)
Is there any chance that the gene therapy isn't permanent?
BECKETT
It's possible.
MCKAY
I'm a dead man.
INT--ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM
[Sheppard stands before a schematic of the Atlantis city-ship. Weir,
Ford, and Teyla are there.]
SHEPPARD
We can probably maintain security in this area with the limited
number of personnel we have.
TEYLA
My people can help.
WEIR
Thank you, Teyla. For the time being, we'll find other ways that the
Athosians can contribute.
TEYLA
You do not trust us?
SHEPPARD
It's not that, it's just that we...we need to train your people in
our weapons and tactics.
TEYLA
You invited me to be a member of your team.
SHEPPARD
And we value your knowledge and expertise.
[McKay enters, looking despondent.]
WEIR
As we value all the Athosians. For now, there should be more than
enough living space for everyone within the designated area.
TEYLA
We have always lived in the shadow of the Wraith, but my people have
never been in a place such as this. They are afraid. Some believe
the ghosts of the Ancestors remain.
WEIR
I don't think that's the case, but-but still, we're going to need a
bit more time in order to explore the entire city.
SHEPPARD
We're very cautious intergalactic explorers.
WEIR
And we don't want anyone else getting hurt the way Halling did. I
mean, everyone needs to understand they are not to touch anything
unfamiliar unless it's been cleared first.
MCKAY
That's very important. I mean you never know. Even a tiny, little,
innocuous-looking thing can...can kill you.
[They look at McKay.]
MCKAY
(raising his hand)
Dead man talking.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett works on some lab equipment. Weir enters.]
WEIR
Carson.
BECKETT
Doctor Weir.
WEIR
So Grodin's got a team going through the Ancient research material
that accompanied the shield device, but McKay's been through it, and
he didn't find anything helpful, and he is "the smartest guy here".
BECKETT
So he likes to tell us. Listen, I feel terrible. It's possible this
was a result of artificially imposing the gene.
WEIR
Well, I have another theory. We know that there is a mental
component to using Ancient technology.
BECKETT
You don't have to remind me. I experienced it firsthand with that
drone weapon back on Earth.
WEIR
Exactly, so don't you think it stands to reason that McKay should be
able to shut this thing off with his mind?
BECKETT
Are you suggesting he doesn't want to shut it off?
WEIR
We may be settling in here, but this place -- it's still pretty
intimidating. I mean, a giant abandoned city full of things way
beyond our level of understanding, impending threat of attack from
the Wraith...
BECKETT
No question, it gets bloody creepy here at night.
WEIR
So I'm not saying it's conscious, but perhaps subconsciously...
[She shrugs.]
BECKETT
I don't think he wants to die of dehydration.
WEIR
No, neither do I, but he's not there yet.
BECKETT
You think when it comes down to it, the shield will just shut itself
down?
WEIR
The Ancients were smart enough to build fail-safes into their other
technology. I mean, this entire city, it rose from the deep of the
ocean when danger was imminent. Why would they design a personal
shield that could kill you?
BECKETT
I certainly hope you're right, for Rodney's sake.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Senior staff stand around Grodin's station as he demonstrates
inputting a password. Teyla is not present.]
GRODIN
The self-destruct system requires two separate codes. Now, each code
is unique, and everyone here will be required to memorize their
code.
MCKAY
Well, don't bother giving me one.
[Grodin gives McKay a look.]
MCKAY
Sorry.
WEIR
As far as we know, this is the only Stargate in the Pegasus Galaxy
which is capable of dialing Earth... which would make it the last
line of defense against the Wraith. If they're going to attack,
which we must consider a very real threat, we simply cannot let them
gain control of this complex.
GRODIN
If both codes are properly entered, the naquadah generator will
overload. It will take thirty seconds.
FORD
You're sure it will do enough damage?
MCKAY
Ever seen a twenty kiloton nuclear explosion?
SHEPPARD
I have.
[Everyone stares at Sheppard.]
SHEPPARD
(dismissively)
Not up close. Look, I think we should tell Teyla what's going on
here.
WEIR
At this moment, we still don't know if it was one of the Athosians
who tipped off your arrival to their planet.
SHEPPARD
I trust Teyla.
WEIR
So do I, but Teyla trusts her people. If we tell her, she'll want to
tell them, and I need more time to get to know them.
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--HALLING'S QUARTERS
[Sheppard sits on a carpeted bench surrounded by several Athosian
children. He is telling them a story in a room lit only by candlelight.
Halling stands nearby, leaning on crutches.]
SHEPPARD
(speaking low and slow)
Well, they thought he was finally dead but when they turned their
backs to go...
[Sheppard suddenly flicks on his flashlight underneath his chin to look
spooky.]
SHEPPARD
(speaking loud and quickly)
His cold dead eyes opened beneath his hockey mask and he rose up
with his giant bloody knife--
[Sheppard suddenly stands and uses his flashlight as a prop for the
knife.]
JINTO
What's a hockey mask?
[Sheppard looks at the children blankly, who are looking equally blank
back at him. The kids are not scared at all.]
SHEPPARD
Hockey's a game. The guys skate around on the ice and try to put a
puck into the net?
[Still no reaction.]
SHEPPARD
The goalies wear masks. It's really... scary.
JINTO
Tell us more of this game.
WEX
Can we play it?
SHEPPARD
(sitting)
Actually I don't really see the attraction. Now,
football...football's a real man's sport, but we'll save that for
another time.
HALLING
Yes, it's time for bed.
ATHOSIAN CHILDREN
(disappointed)
Awww.
SHEPPARD
Now, remember, tomorrow night, kids, another tale called "Nightmare
on Elm Street."
TEYLA
All right, children, let's go.
[She herds them out of the room.]
HALLING
Thank you, Major.
SHEPPARD
I hope I didn't scare them too much.
HALLING
(dryly)
I don't think so.
SHEPPARD
Good.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Teyla leads the last of the children back to their parents.]
TEYLA
(to child)
Good night. Good night.
[She waves farewell. Sheppard approaches.]
SHEPPARD
Uh, listen, Teyla. Don't tell McKay what I said about the hockey not
being a real man's sport, because, uh, it's a Canadian thing.
They're a little touchy about it.
TEYLA
I am interested in hearing more about this, um, "football" you say
you love so much.
SHEPPARD
I can do one better. Come here.
[He leads her away.]
INT--HALLING'S QUARTERS
[Jinto lies on his side one bed. Halling is stretched out on the next
bed.]
JINTO
Father, do you think we are safe here from the Wraith?
HALLING
(sighing)
I think there's nothing certain in life...except my love for you.
[Jinto smiles.]
JINTO
Do you miss the wind?
HALLING
Yes, but if you're very quiet, you can hear the ocean.
JINTO
Do you think the ghosts of the Ancestors still live here?
HALLING
Jinto! Go to sleep.
[Jinto sighs.]
INT--ATLANTIS RECREATION ROOM
[Sheppard passes a bowl of popcorn to McKay. Ford, McKay, Sheppard, and
Teyla are watching a football game on a monitor.]
MCKAY
Funny.
[Sheppard eats some popcorn himself and sits up as a certain play is
set up.]
SHEPPARD
Oh, here it comes. Watch this.
ANNOUNCER
Flutie is back. Fours seconds, three seconds, two seconds, one...
Flutie throws. This game is over. Hail Mary, it is caught!
SHEPPARD
Oh! That is beautiful. Can you believe that?
TEYLA
(befuddled)
Should I not?
SHEPPARD
Well, the defense didn't cover the receiver because he didn't think
the quarterback could throw that far.
TEYLA
They seem very happy.
SHEPPARD
Well, they just won one of the best games of all times against all
odds.
FORD
Flutie won the Heisman that year. And then went on to play in
Canada.
TEYLA
He played hockey, too?
[Ford snickers as McKay stares stone-faced at Teyla. Weir enters.]
WEIR
Hey, what are you guys doing?
SHEPPARD
I'm teaching Teyla how football is the corner stone of western
civilization.
WEIR
(with mock petulance)
And you didn't invite me?
SHEPPARD
What, you like football?
WEIR
(smiling in confession)
No, not really.
SHEPPARD
Oh, come on. It-it's real, it's unpredictable, it's full of passion
and...beer, hot dogs...
MCKAY
Cheerleaders.
WEIR
I just can't understand. You're allowed one personal item, and you
chose this.
[Weir snatches some popcorn.]
SHEPPARD
It's a metaphor. Don't you see? This entire expedition is the
biggest Hail Mary in human history.
TEYLA
What is a Hail Mary?
[Ford and McKay look amused as Sheppard scrambles.]
SHEPPARD
It's a play that you just saw. It's named after a prayer. See,
there's this woman, and her name is Mary, and she...uh... Did I
mention how much I like Ferris wheels?
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR QUARTERS
[Jinto sneaks out of his room and stands by another door.]
JINTO
Psst.
[The door immediately opens and Wex comes out holding the Wraith mask
they played with on Athos. He hands it to Jinto.]
WEX
Your turn to be the Wraith.
JINTO
You can be the Wraith. I get to be Major Sheppard.
WEX
Oh!
[Wex sighs that he didn't think of it first as Jinto grabs a wooden
stick and hides his eyes.]
JINTO
One, two, three, four, five, six...
[Wex looks down the corridor and takes off. Jinto peeks while
counting.]
[Jinto opens his eyes and starts down after Wex, but a whooshing sound
behind him makes him turn back. He then hears another beep behind a
different door. He cautiously approaches.]
JINTO
Wex?
[Jinto opens the door to find it being used as a storage closet filled
with cases from the Earth expedition. He looks around but sees no one.]
[Wex climbs out from behind some boxes after hiding for a long time. He
takes off his Wraith mask.]
WEX
Jinto?
INT--SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS
[Sheppard lounges on his bed reading. There is a knock at the door.]
HALLING
Major? Major!
[Sheppard instantly springs from the bed and opens the door. Halling
and Wex stand outside.]
HALLING
Jinto's missing. I can't find him. I told him to be careful.
Anything he touches could be dangerous.
WEX
What if there are monsters here?
SHEPPARD
Then we'll find him.
[Sheppard grabs his jacket and leads them out at a run.]
INT--FORD'S QUARTERS
[A sleepy Ford opens his door to find Sheppard on the other side fully
geared up.]
SHEPPARD
Jinto's missing. Teams of two. Floor-to-floor sweep now. Start with
the jumpers. Full gear.
FORD
(instantly alert)
Yes, sir.
[Ford grabs his gear.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Teyla and Halling meet up with Sheppard.]
TEYLA
He's not in any of the other living quarters.
HALLING
I'm coming with you.
SHEPPARD
You're going to be okay with that leg?
HALLING
He's my son.
[Sheppard gives a grim nod. They head out.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
Can we use the sensors to locate him?
MCKAY
We don't have nearly enough power to activate the whole city at one
time.
GRODIN
Even if we could, the sensors don't distinguish...
[The power flickers.]
GRODIN
...individuals.
MCKAY
And for all we know, there could be shielded areas or, uh,...
(pointing)
malfunctioning sensors. We are getting a pretty strange energy
reading in one of the unexplored areas across the city.
[McKay shows a blinking section on the city schematic.]
WEIR
Activate the communication system.
[McKay keys a control.]
MCKAY
Done.
WEIR
Jinto, this is Dr. Weir. If you can hear me, please respond.
[Weir's voice echoes through all the corridors of Atlantis, heard by
everyone.]
WEIR
(continuing)
Jinto? If you're lost, if you can't--
[The power cuts off.]
GRODIN
We've lost power.
MCKAY
Still got lights.
[Grodin moves to another control and presses a button.]
GRODIN
I don't know why that happened.
[The Stargate shield activates. Everyone stares in surprise. Grodin
backs away from the controls and raises his hands.]
GRODIN
(innocently)
That wasn't me.
[The shield shuts down. The Stargate starts to dial out.]
WEIR
Shut it down now.
[McKay hits the cancel key in the center of the DHD. The Stargate shuts
down.]
WEIR
What the hell is going on?
MCKAY
I don't know.
GRODIN
Nothing like this has happened before.
MCKAY
We've only been here for a couple of days.
[They stare at McKay.]
MCKAY
This stuff is pretty old. It's that, or there really are ghosts.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Halling and Sheppard head down a corridor. The power shuts down.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Control room, this is Sheppard. The lights just went out.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Major, we're experiencing some technical malfunctions.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Halling and Sheppard stare around, looking spooked.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[An entity looks down the corridor. From its POV, the area looks
rippled, like seeing a reflection in disturbed water. It sees Sheppard
and Halling about to approach.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
MCKAY
It could have something to do with the interfaces between our
naquadah generators and the city. Well, that, or the way we isolated
certain systems could be causing erroneous operations in the Ancient
programming.
GRODIN
I'll run a diagnostic on the power flow.
WEIR
I wouldn't have thought you believed in ghosts.
MCKAY
I never used to, then I learned about things called "Wraiths" that
can suck the life out of you with their hands. What the hell is
that?
TEYLA
Doctor Weir.
WEIR
Teyla, I'll be right there. Do what you can.
MCKAY
Thanks.
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Teyla leads Weir to a teenage girl.]
TEYLA
Doctor Weir, this is Marta.
WEIR
Pleased to meet you.
[Marta nods nervously but says nothing.]
TEYLA
It's all right. Tell her what you saw.
MARTA
A shadow.
TEYLA
The Wraith project them -- make you see things that aren't there.
WEIR
Are you sure?
TEYLA
And yet, I sense no Wraith here.
WEIR
Teyla, have you ever been wrong about that?
[Teyla purses her lips, looking unsure.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Major Sheppard, this is Weir. One of the Athosians is claiming to
have seen what she's calling a shadow.
MARTA
(to Teyla)
She does not believe me?
[Weir moves further away from Marta.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Teyla says that she senses no Wraith here, but I'm still concerned.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
All right, all teams fall back to the gate room and wait for further
instructions.
HALLING
We can't stop searching.
SHEPPARD
If there is a threat here, we need to establish a proper perimeter.
[The entity observes Halling and Sheppard moving away.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Sheppard, Halling, Teyla, Weir, and McKay are all in the control
room.]
SHEPPARD
I've secured access to all the control towers and living quarters.
WEIR
Two more Athosians reported seeing the shadows.
SHEPPARD
You know, I don't get that. That means the Wraith would be here.
WEIR
You don't think so?
SHEPPARD
I don't think they want to scare us. When they decide to come,
they're going to start blowing the crap out of this place with their
ships.
WEIR
So what? The Athosians are just seeing things?
SHEPPARD
Well, like Teyla said, it's a scary place for them.
MCKAY
Not just for them.
TEYLA
Halling wishes to speak with Jinto.
WEIR
Please...
[McKay presses a button.]
MCKAY
Go ahead.
HALLING
(into radio)
Jinto... If you can hear me, I'm not angry. I just want to know that
you are safe. So if you are lost or hurt, stay where you are. Make
some noise if you can. We will find you.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDORS
[Halling's voice can be heard throughout all of Atlantis by the various
expedition members.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Halling puts his crutches to one side and stands in a meditation pose,
his fingertips touching and bowed downward.]
HALLING
Pereh lumi... et tempo ateri.
SHEPPARD
What is that, Latin?
WEIR
It's Ancient. "Fathers of light of the everlasting temple"?
[Teyla overhears.]
TEYLA
It is a prayer to the Ancestors.
HALLING
(lifting his arms)
If you are angry that we have unrightfully inhabited your great
city, we humbly apologize. We mean no harm. We will leave if it is
your wish, but I will not go without my son.
[All the lights go out. McKay collapses in a faint.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Sheppard stands by as Beckett examines McKay.]
BECKETT
He fainted.
MCKAY
There's got to be a better word.
BECKETT
"Faint" is the proper medical term.
MCKAY
I passed out from...manly hunger.
[Beckett scoffs.]
SHEPPARD
Well, hang in there.
(into radio)
Doctor Weir, this is Sheppard. McKay's okay. He...he fainted.
[He starts to leave.]
MCKAY
(irritated)
Oh, yeah, that's very sympathetic. Let's all mock the dying man.
Thank you.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[Sheppard is still smiling as he leaves the infirmary. The power goes
out around him. Warily, Sheppard primes his rifle and looks around. He
heads down the darkened corridor, spotting the entity the same time it
spots him. It is a shadowy blackness spreading across the hall. It
moves to one side of the corridor, while Sheppard, weapon aimed holds
defensively near the other. The entity passes Sheppard and continues
down the hall. Sheppard follows.]
INT--POWER ROOM
[The power comes back on in the corridor after the entity passes by.
Grodin backs out of the power room in alarm, standing with Sheppard as
the entity surrounds the naquadah generator in blackness.]
EXT--ATLANTIS, NIGHT
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Grodin and Sheppard brief Weir and McKay.]
SHEPPARD
It didn't look like the phantoms the Wraith make you see, but I can
see how the Athosians would be confused.
WEIR
What did it look like?
SHEPPARD
It looked like a...
GRODIN
Darkness. It surrounded the naquadah generator and started to grow
like it was feeding off the energy.
SHEPPARD
When you shut it down, the whole...whatever it was, it just went
away.
MCKAY
(gesturing with a sealed power bar)
If this thing feeds on energy, we could be in big trouble, and when
I say "we," I mean "you," because I won't actually be around for
much longer.
WEIR
So we need to figure out exactly what it is and what to do about it.
GRODIN
We know it's attracted to energy.
WEIR
How about shutting down the generators?
MCKAY
Well, uh...people also give off heat energy but now, granted, it's
negligible compared to that of a naquadah generator, but you take
away this thing's only other obvious source of food, and--
WEIR
Are you saying it could come after us?
MCKAY
Well, I only know one thing for sure, and that is that flying
darkness that eats energy can only be very, very bad.
WEIR
Okay, we keep the power on. Grodin, figure out a way to detect it,
and in the meantime, Major, establish a constant surveillance on all
the generators. If one of them is targeted, we'll shut it down
remotely. I mean, hopefully, we can keep this...thing busy until we
figure out a way to get rid of it.
(into radio)
Attention, everyone. This is Weir. For the time being, we need you
all to remain in your quarters unless otherwise instructed. If you
see anything out of the--
JINTO
(over radio)
Hello? Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Jinto?
JINTO
(into radio)
Major Sheppard!
WEIR
(into radio)
Are you okay?
JINTO
(into radio)
I'm scared.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Where are you?
JINTO
(over radio)
I don't know.
WEIR
(into radio)
Jinto, start from the beginning. Tell us how you got to where you
are.
JINTO
(over radio)
I was in the hall outside my quarters.
[They take off to that location.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, NEAR HALLING'S QUARTERS
[The group looks around.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Where'd you go next?
JINTO
(over radio)
I can't remember.
TEYLA
He's used to the forest, being able to see the stars at night.
JINTO
(over radio)
I found a small room filled with boxes from Earth.
[McKay and Sheppard exchange looks and then head to a door at the end
of the passageway. They open it to find it empty.]
SHEPPARD
No boxes.
JINTO
(over radio)
They're here with me.
MCKAY
Someone thought it would make a nice closet.
[Sheppard and McKay step inside. A control panel opens showing a
schematic of the city.]
SHEPPARD
This is definitely not a closet.
(into radio)
Did the panel start to glow when you stepped inside?
JINTO
(over radio)
Yes!
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Did you touch it?
JINTO
(over radio, guiltily)
Yes.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
What exactly?
JINTO
(over radio)
I don't remember.
MCKAY
Just before he disappeared, we got an unusual energy reading from
this area here.
[McKay points. Sheppard moves to touch the display.]
MCKAY
Wait, wait, wait. No, no...
[The door closes on them.]
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[The door opens, and Sheppard and McKay find themselves in another part
of the city. They step out.]
MCKAY
It must be a transporter.
SHEPPARD
We can name it later.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR HALLING'S QUARTERS
[Weir opens the closed door. The boxes have returned. Halling and Teyla
look on in alarm.]
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[Jinto peers out from behind a corner.]
JINTO
Major Sheppard.
[He runs to them, frightened.]
SHEPPARD
Jinto. Are you okay?
JINTO
Yes.
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
We've got Jinto. He's okay.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR HALLING'S QUARTERS
[Teyla pats a relieved Halling on the shoulder as they all smile.]
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[McKay steps to a console and activates it.]
SHEPPARD
Do you have any idea what this place is?
MCKAY
Some sort of research lab. We've come across a few of them. These
consoles generally access the central computer systems, so Jinto
could've caused what we thought were malfunctions from here. Look, I
need to know everything you touched.
[Jinto looks very nervous at the attention the two adults are giving
him.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Weir approaches Grodin's station.]
GRODIN
As far as I can tell, there's only one entity. Now, the bright blue
spots are the active naquadah generators. This blob is our entity.
It was just a matter of calibrating the sensors. Your idea is
working. So far, I've been able to anticipate its approach to the
active generators and shut them off remotely. Here, watch.
[He demonstrates on the display how the entity moves as power sources
turn off.]
GRODIN
I've got it going in circles.
WEIR
Good job.
GRODIN
Thanks.
WEIR
(ruefully)
I hope we're not making this thing mad.
[Grodin nods, then his attention is drawn to the display.]
GRODIN
(into radio)
Lieutenant...this is Dr. Grodin. I'm tracking the entity heading
your way. You might want to get out of the hall you're standing in.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
FORD
(into radio)
Roger that.
[He and Stackhouse double back. As they approach another corridor, a
door slams shut, trapping them.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
FORD
(over radio)
Uh, this is Ford. A bulkhead just blocked our way. There's no panel
on the wall or any way to open it that we can see.
GRODIN
(into radio)
Roger that.
WEIR
(into radio)
McKay?
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
MCKAY
(into radio)
We didn't touch anything. It could be the entity causing random
malfunctions. The proximity to that large an energy disturbance
could cause the Ancient technology to-to go haywire.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(into radio)
Lieutenant, double-back and try the door on the east side of the
hall.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[The pair comply, moving warily, but it doesn't respond to the
controls.]
FORD
(into radio)
This door won't open either.
STACKHOUSE
Here it comes.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Pull open the console on the wall.
[The entity approaches. Ford takes the cover off the console.]
STACKHOUSE
(low, nervous)
Hurry.
FORD
(into radio)
What next?
[The conversation switches between McKay's and Ford's locations.]
MCKAY
(into radio)
I'm not sure. What do you see?
FORD
(over radio)
Three crystals.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Take out the middle one. Move the top one down.
[Ford works on the display.]
FORD
(to Stackhouse)
When this door opens, go. I'll be right behind you.
(into radio)
Not working.
MCKAY
(into radio)
Okay, use the middle one to bridge the two others.
FORD
(into radio)
You sure about this?
MCKAY
(into radio, weakly)
Not exactly.
[Ford does so. The door opens.]
FORD
(to Stackhouse)
Go!
[Ford guards their retreat, but the entity is on top of him. His
screams can be heard through the radio. Stackhouse stumbles back to his
feet from the safety of the chamber to find Ford unconscious and his
body smoking.]
STACKHOUSE
(into radio)
Man down. I need a medical team.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Beckett is at Ford's bedside.]
BECKETT
All right, hang in there.
[He spots Weir and Sheppard approaching and goes to meet them.]
BECKETT
Are we in any danger here?
WEIR
I wish I could tell you.
SHEPPARD
How's Ford?
BECKETT
It's like he was hit by lightning.
WEIR
He's going to be okay?
BECKETT
He's a tough kid.
[He leaves them. They approach Ford's bedside, where Stackhouse is
sitting with him. Stackhouse stands in Sheppard's presence.]
STACKHOUSE
Sir.
[Sheppard smiles and nods at Stackhouse, then grins down at Ford.]
SHEPPARD
Hi.
[Ford sighs and takes the oxygen cannulis off his nose.]
FORD
Will you tell this guy there's nothing he could have done?
SHEPPARD
(to Stackhouse, honestly)
There is nothing you could have done.
STACKHOUSE
I could have tried to pull him out, sir.
FORD
(weakly)
Yeah, then we'd both look like this.
WEIR
Ah, you don't look so bad.
SHEPPARD
Doctor Beckett says you're going to be back to, uh, pretty boy in no
time.
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[Weir and Sheppard step out of the newly found transporter and join
McKay.]
SHEPPARD
Apparently, it's also an elevator.
MCKAY
Really?
WEIR
We can stop taking the stairs everywhere.
MCKAY
(piqued)
Oh, how nice for you all.
SHEPPARD
What do you got?
MCKAY
Well, believe it or not, Jinto didn't, uh, touch anything of any
consequence, other than that.
[He gestures to a large device.]
MCKAY
It must have its own power source, like the jumpers.
WEIR
What is it?
MCKAY
Well, it's some sort of containment vessel for the energy creature.
SHEPPARD
And Jinto released it?
MCKAY
Well, it seems that way.
MCKAY
As I suggested, the entity's what's been causing most of our
technical problems. Now, it was captured for observation. The
Ancients were researching Ascension.
WEIR
(excited)
Really?
SHEPPARD
What exactly is "ascension"?
MCKAY
Well, at some point during their evolution, the Ancients reached an
advanced stage of being where they were able to rid themselves of
their physical bodies and rise to a higher plain of existence, one
in which they live as pure energy. We--I know it sounds ridiculous,
but this is the first indication there may have been evolutionary
intervention to get there.
SHEPPARD
A little gene therapy of their own, huh?
MCKAY
Well, I haven't read all the notes, but what I do know is that the
entity is energy. It feeds on energy. Ford's lucky. I mean, the more
it feeds, the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more charged
it becomes and the more deadly it will be.
WEIR
Is it intelligent?
MCKAY
Well, according to the research, it...it is sentient, but if you're
thinking about trying to talk to it, you'd have more luck with a
great white shark. This thing is going to suck the power out of our
generators, and then it will kill us all.
WEIR
All right. What do we do about it?
MCKAY
The entity has been trapped in here since before the Ancients
abandoned the city.
SHEPPARD
I know I'd be pissed.
MCKAY
And hungry. The point is...this device was designed to attract it,
capture it, and hold it for observation. There's still a chance we
might be able to get it back inside. I'm just going to need a little
more time to figure out how.
INT--ATLANTIS INFIRMARY
[Teyla and Jinto enter the infirmary and approach Ford's bed.]
FORD
Hey.
TEYLA
Jinto has something he wishes to say.
JINTO
(nervous)
I'm sorry. What happened to you was...my fault.
FORD
Where I come from, we've got a little saying-- "stuff happens."
Actually, it's a little different, but you didn't mean for this to
happen, did you?
[Jinto shakes his head.]
FORD
You're a good kid. You weren't doing anything wrong, which means
this isn't your fault, okay? Same as when-when we came to your
planet, we didn't mean for the Wraith to show up. They just did.
That's why you're here. You-your home was destroyed. You almost lost
your dad. I don't remember you getting mad at me over that.
JINTO
(hesitantly)
Stuff happens.
[They smile.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Grodin, bored at watching his display, suddenly becomes alert at a
change in the entity's movements.]
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
WEIR
It's not falling for the same tricks anymore.
SHEPPARD
How smart is this thing?
WEIR
Rodney?
MCKAY
I don't know, but this is much simpler than I thought. It's kind of
like a mousetrap. This button here causes the device to emit an
energy signature that attracts the creature. This one shuts it in.
Now, the only downside is it looks like, uh, someone's actually
going to have to be here to press the buttons.
[As he speaks, he indicates the appropriate controls.]
SHEPPARD
(sighing)
I'll do it.
MCKAY
Okay.
[He starts to leave. Weir frowns.]
WEIR
Wait a minute, Rodney. You're still wearing the shield. Isn't there
a chance that if something went wrong, that would protect you?
[McKay looks stunned. The shield powers down and falls off his chest
into his hand. They all stare at each other a moment, then McKay
rummages in his pocket for his unopened power bar, taking a big bite.]
MCKAY
(pleased)
Hmm!
WEIR
I had a feeling.
MCKAY
What do you mean? Had a feeling about what? You think I wanted it to
come off just now? You think I'm scared? I'm not scared. I'll stay.
I'll do this.
SHEPPARD
(sarcastic)
No, that's okay. You might faint again.
MCKAY
It--it's just not working anymore.
[He tries to press it to Sheppard's chest.]
MCKAY
Look...see, it doesn't work on you either.
WEIR
Look, I just meant that it wasn't going to let you die.
MCKAY
(frustrated)
Well, it is just a coincidence that it happened to stop working now.
God, I need a drink.
SHEPPARD
Go.
[McKay leaves as Sheppard and Weir exchange looks.]
INT--HALLING'S CHAMBERS
[Halling sits at Jinto's bedside. Jinto frowns.]
JINTO
You always told me I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.
HALLING
Well, I was wrong.
JINTO
I can't sleep now. What if the darkness comes?
TEYLA
It won't.
[Teyla stands by the open doorway.]
JINTO
How do you know?
TEYLA
Because...
[Teyla uses her lighter to ignite a candle from across the room.]
TEYLA
It's afraid of fire.
JINTO
The darkness is afraid?
[Teyla sits on Jinto's bed.]
TEYLA
Everything is afraid of something.
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR
[The entity, getting larger, moves through the corridors.]
INT--ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ATHOSIAN QUARTERS
[Weir walks through the area, smiling in acknowledgment to the
Athosians. Candles are lit everywhere as they comfort each other in
their fear.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Grodin approaches to Weir.]
GRODIN
So the shield device just came off by itself?
WEIR
Yeah, it just stopped working. He even tried it on Sheppard.
GRODIN
It wouldn't work on Sheppard.
WEIR
Why not?
GRODIN
McKay didn't tell you? The text we studied said the shield imprints
on the wearer. If we're right, it wouldn't work on anyone else.
[McKay enters, carrying a large flood flashlight and eating a wrap of
some sort. Weir stares at him as Grodin takes his seat.]
MCKAY
Are we ready?
GRODIN
You do realize that when we shut everything down, we're going to
lose the sensors. We're not going to be able to track it.
WEIR
We have security personnel posted around the living quarters. At
least we have some warning.
[She lights a candle.]
WEIR
Teyla told the Athosian children that lighting a candle will help
protect them.
MCKAY
And you're doing it because?
WEIR
It's going to get dark in here.
MCKAY
Hmm.
[He lights his floodlight and mutters smugly.]
WEIR
(into radio)
Okay, Major, go ahead.
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[Sheppard activates the containment vessel.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
WEIR
(to Grodin)
Now.
GRODIN
Shutting down power.
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[All the power goes off except for the containment vessel. Sheppard
turns on the light on his rifle. He sees the shadowy entity coming his
way.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
It's coming.
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[They nervously exchange looks.]
INT--ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB
[The conversation switches between the lab and control room.]
[Sheppard gets a look at how large the entity is.]
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.
MCKAY
(over radio)
Size doesn't matter.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
That's a myth.
MCKAY
(into radio)
It'll fit. The device traps the creature in subspace. You just need
to make sure it gets all the way inside the containment vessel.
[The entity comes closer.]
SHEPPARD
All right, come on.
[The entity approaches the vessel, studying it and Sheppard. It then
moves away rapidly.]
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Son of a bitch.
WEIR
(into radio)
What happened?
SHEPPARD
(over radio)
Damn thing took one look and went away. It's a lot smarter than we
thought.
EXT--ATLANTIS, DAY
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Teyla stares down at the Stargate as Grodin, McKay, Sheppard, and Weir
are around a console.]
WEIR
We need to know where it is right now.
GRODIN
We'll have to turn the power on to use the sensors.
MCKAY
You can't do that.
WEIR
Do it, but just the operations tower.
SHEPPARD
What now?
WEIR
It's headed this way.
MCKAY
Because you turned the power back on.
WEIR
We can't go on like this.
TEYLA
Do you think it wants to be here?
SHEPPARD
What do you mean?
TEYLA
It's been trapped here for thousands of years, alone.
WEIR
It's not alone anymore.
MCKAY
It doesn't think on that level. It thinks about eating. That's it.
SHEPPARD
You would know.
TEYLA
If we stay, it will kill us.
SHEPPARD
Not unless we can kill it first.
MCKAY
Well, I don't see how.
TEYLA
Then either we must go, or it must. Maybe it wants to go. If we open
the Stargate...
INT--ATLANTIS GATE ROOM
[Sheppard and McKay set up a naquadah generator on a MALP.]
MCKAY
This is a bad idea.
WEIR
You said that already.
MCKAY
Well, it's worth saying again.
[From the control room, Teyla and Grodin see the entity's movements
heading towards the Gate Room. She runs to the balcony.]
TEYLA
It's coming.
MCKAY
An open Stargate is a huge power source. This thing is smart. It
knew enough not to get trapped in the Ancient containment vessel
again. What makes you think it's going to follow a naquadah
generator into the wormhole?
SHEPPARD
Well, you got a better idea?
[McKay closes the lid on the container holding the generator.]
MCKAY
Good luck.
[He runs up the stairs.]
WEIR
Are you okay?
[Sheppard nods tensely.]
INT--ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM
[Everyone but Sheppard is now upstairs.]
GRODIN
It's almost here.
WEIR
Do you have an address?
GRODIN
M4X-337, a barren wasteland.
WEIR
Dial it.
(to Teyla)
That was good thinking.
[Teyla nods.]
[The entity now enters the Gate Room. Sheppard sees it approach, then
hits the activation for the MALP, sending it on its way as he runs
away. The entity swarms around it in a black smoke, filling the Gate
Room. The MALP cannot be seen.]
MCKAY
It's not goin' anywhere.
WEIR
I can't see if the MALP got through.
GRODIN
The entity could have drained the battery.
MCKAY
(angry)
It could be feeding off the generator, off the Stargate. I mean, t
his is a disaster.
WEIR
Shut it down.
[McKay tries to shut down the gate.]
MCKAY
I can't.
GRODIN
The consoles are dead.
WEIR
There must be something we can do.
[Unnoticed by the others, McKay takes out the shield from his pocket,
staring at it.]
GRODIN
We don't know if the MALP is still down there. It's possible that
the entity will still go through the gate once it's depleted the
energy in the naquadah generator on the MALP.
WEIR
Or it could just continue to feed off the gate's energy.
[McKay places the shield back on himself. Everyone else is staring at
the entity. McKay steps to the top of the staircase. Sheppard suddenly
notices he's on the stairs.]
SHEPPARD
McKay!
[He runs toward McKay but is too late to stop him. Weir spots McKay
heading down the staircase, the green shield reacting as the entity
tries to swarm him.]
WEIR
Rodney!
[Inside the entity, McKay sees particles of electricity reacting to
each other. He spots the MALP a few feet from the Stargate. He picks up
the container holding the generator and hurls it through the open
wormhole. The entity follows.]
[As the last of the entity's smoke disappears through the wormhole, the
Stargate deactivates. McKay lies supine, unconscious in the middle of
the 'gate room. Everyone runs downstairs. Sheppard kneels beside him
and touches his arm.]
WEIR
McKay?
[She touches his chest, and the shield falls into her hand, completely
dead.]
GRODIN
The power must have been drained by the entity.
SHEPPARD
(into radio)
Medical team to the gate room.
WEIR
(touching him)
He's not burned. He's breathing.
WEIR
McKay?
[He stirs.]
WEIR
McKay. Hey.
MCKAY
What happened?
WEIR
You did it.
MCKAY
I did?
WEIR
It went through the 'gate.
SHEPPARD
You must have passed out.
MCKAY
Well, thanks for not saying the other thing.
[Everyone smiles, relieved. Sheppard stands again.]
SHEPPARD
(to Teyla)
That was a Hail Mary.
[Weir and Grodin help McKay sit up. He groans, then notices the medics
finally arriving.]
MCKAY
(caustic, but weak)
Thank you. Take your time. Man down.
FADE OUT
